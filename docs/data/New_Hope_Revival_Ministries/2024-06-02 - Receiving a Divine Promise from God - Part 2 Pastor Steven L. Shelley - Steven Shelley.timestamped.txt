[33:55] precious love of God. Oh, it chases me
[34:02] down. Fights till I'm found. leaves a 99
[34:09] and I couldn't earn it and I don't
[34:12] deserve it. Still you give yourself away
[34:19] and all the overwhelming
[34:23] neverending
[34:26] precious love of God.
[34:31] Oh Lord,
[34:35] The love that you give to us,
[34:39] it is it has no bounds to it.
[34:44] It h it's endless. Lord,
[34:47] we just bless you and thank you.
[34:51] Oh Jesus,
[34:55] how we love you.
[34:59] We love you, Lord.
[35:03] Hallelujah,
[35:06] Jesus.
[35:10] Oh, would you just lift your hands and
[35:12] receive his love today?
[35:15] The precious neverending love of our
[35:18] savior.
[35:21] How we love you, Lord.
[35:24] We love you, Lord.
[35:27] We love you, Lord.
[35:30] Lord,
[35:33] thank you Jesus.
[35:36] Thank you Lord.
[35:38] Thank you Lord.
[35:40] Thank you Lord.
[35:44] Oh praise his name.
[35:47] We want to go to prayer today and take
[35:49] our needs to the Lord.
[35:53] Jesus.
[35:54] Do you have a need by the lifting of a
[35:57] hand?
[35:59] God sees the need behind the hand, but
[36:03] we don't go as beggars.
[36:07] We go in the order of the word.
[36:11] It's done.
[36:14] It's done.
[36:16] I have a minister friend who reached out
[36:19] during the service last night who's just
[36:21] gone through a very serious surgery. He
[36:23] lives in Arizona. He's asked that we
[36:26] pray for him that God will give him a
[36:28] supernatural recovery.
[36:29] Yes, Lord.
[36:30] Uh I had a chat with Sister Pam this
[36:32] morning and brother Garvis, they were
[36:35] able to take a liter of fluid off
[36:38] through dialysis,
[36:40] praying that his blood pressure will
[36:42] remain stable so that they can take
[36:45] probably another two liters of fluid
[36:47] off. The goal is
[36:50] the doctors are hope hoping the family
[36:53] of course is hoping that these
[36:57] dialysis treatments will kickstart his
[37:00] kidneys to functioning again. It has
[37:03] happened. It does happen.
[37:05] It's certainly I spoke with him on the
[37:07] phone this week and it's certainly not
[37:09] his desire to be on permanent dialysis.
[37:12] Of course not.
[37:14] But God knows exactly how how he's going
[37:16] to work in this situation. But let's
[37:19] pray for them particularly. And I wasn't
[37:22] able to get an update from my dear
[37:24] friend. Uh and many of the church folks
[37:28] would know this precious sister who was
[37:30] taken to the emergency room with stroke
[37:32] symptoms. Let's continue to remember
[37:35] her. God knows who she is and he knows
[37:37] what's going on in her body.
[37:39] Right. Right.
[37:42] I know there are many urgent needs in
[37:44] this congregation. There are needs out
[37:46] across that camera. But our Lord knows
[37:50] and he knows best how to take care of
[37:52] it.
[37:53] Yes, he does.
[37:54] Will you sing this old song with us as
[37:56] we prepare to pray?
[37:58] There is
[38:01] a fountain
[38:04] filled
[38:06] with blood drawn from
[38:10] Emmanuel's
[38:12] veins.
[38:14] [Music]
[38:16] And sinners
[38:18] plunged beneath
[38:21] that flood lose all their guilty
[38:27] stains.
[38:30] Lose all their guilty
[38:35] stains.
[38:38] lose all their guilty
[38:42] stains
[38:46] and sinners
[38:48] plunged beneath
[38:51] that flood lose all their gill.
[38:57] Brother Hawk, will you come and pray
[38:59] today, please? The dying
[39:03] thief rejoice
[39:06] to see that fountain
[39:11] in his name.
[39:16] And there
[39:18] may I go vile as he wash all my sin
[39:27] away.
[39:30] Wash all my sin
[39:35] away.
[39:38] Wash all my sin
[39:42] away.
[39:45] And there
[39:48] may I go by as he walk
[40:02] [Music]
[40:07] heavenly father
[40:10] we thank you for a new and a living way.
[40:13] Yes sir.
[40:14] And your word also says that we have
[40:17] been loosed
[40:19] from sin.
[40:20] Yes.
[40:22] Loosed from unbelief.
[40:25] So we are believers today.
[40:27] Yes sir.
[40:28] We believe on the finished work of the
[40:32] cross.
[40:33] It's the power of the cross that Paul
[40:36] preached.
[40:37] Yes sir.
[40:37] And you crucified and resurrected.
[40:40] Amen. And we are relying depending on
[40:44] that.
[40:46] You already went the extra mile, climbed
[40:50] the mountain, kicked down the wall.
[40:53] You came down and went on the cross.
[40:56] And you came to us and revealed yourself
[40:59] as the resurrected savior. And in you
[41:03] there is healing. There is deliverance.
[41:06] And there is hope.
[41:08] There is eternal life. And so, Father,
[41:11] we just we believe and decree healing
[41:14] for those from the prayer request
[41:17] yesterday. Serious request for brother
[41:20] Garvis, Lord, healing into their bodies
[41:24] in the authority of Jesus Christ. And we
[41:27] command Satan to leave the children of
[41:30] God. And we believe that the Jesus
[41:33] Christ would be manifested in their body
[41:36] for the glory of the living God.
[41:41] Father, we just want to thank you and
[41:43] acknowledge that you're doing something
[41:45] amazing in our midst. You're raising
[41:48] expectation.
[41:50] You're stirring hope.
[41:51] And Father, I just most of all, I just
[41:53] pray for every one of us that you would
[41:56] draw us draw us closer to you
[41:59] because the meaning of life is to know
[42:01] you and grow in the stature of Christ.
[42:04] And we just need you and we call on you,
[42:07] Father, in Jesus' name.
[42:09] Let the perfect plan of God unfold in
[42:12] this service and in all of our lives.
[42:16] You taught us for your kingdom to come.
[42:19] That's the reality of God in our hearts.
[42:23] May it manifest in us and then through
[42:25] us. Oh God.
[42:26] Yes sir.
[42:28] Let the spirit of revelation and
[42:29] understanding come upon us today and
[42:32] give us the grace to have a heart to set
[42:35] have a seed put in us that would bear a
[42:38] lot of fruit for your glory in Jesus
[42:41] name.
[42:42] Amen.
[42:43] Amen. Amen.
[42:45] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[42:48] Lord,
[42:48] we give you praise, Lord.
[42:52] [Applause]
[42:55] Since
[42:56] by faith I saw
[43:01] that stream, thy flowing
[43:05] wounds.
[43:10] Redeeming
[43:12] love has been my theme.
[43:17] And it shall
[43:19] be till I die.
[43:25] And it shall
[43:27] be till I die.
[43:31] [Music]
[43:33] It shall be till
[43:36] I die.
[43:39] My redeeing
[43:42] love has been my theme. And it shall
[43:50] be till
[43:52] I die.
[43:54] [Music]
[43:57] Give him another shout of praise.
[44:00] Oh Lord, we thank you for redeeming
[44:02] love.
[44:08] You may have your seats today.
[44:11] We are so glad to be gathered in the
[44:13] house of the Lord.
[44:17] Wonderful time that we had together last
[44:20] night.
[44:21] The Lord meeting with us and giving us
[44:24] another opportunity to come and worship
[44:26] together today to see when we bring our
[44:30] licks of fire together what he will do
[44:33] among us.
[44:34] Oh, we're all important in the economy
[44:37] of God moving among us
[44:40] because what we get is what we expect or
[44:43] what we expect is what we get. And if we
[44:45] come with an expectation and others come
[44:48] with expectation, the Lord moves among
[44:51] us. Oh, he's so good. We once again
[44:55] welcome all of our visitors that came to
[44:58] be in this weekend meeting recognized
[45:01] last night. this brother that came with
[45:03] brother Shaw today. Joey, we welcome you
[45:05] today asking the Lord to minister to you
[45:08] the needs that you have in the service.
[45:10] We just are happy to be gathered
[45:12] together and know that the Lord doesn't
[45:15] disappoint.
[45:17] He may not come when you want him,
[45:19] but he's always on time.
[45:23] You know, I I was thinking concerning
[45:25] the message last night. It's already
[45:27] done. And and I was just standing there
[45:31] just pondering the Lord's prayer. How
[45:34] does that fit into the Lord's prayer?
[45:36] Because the Lord's prayer was given to
[45:38] us as an example. And my thought
[45:41] immediately went to give us this day our
[45:45] daily bread.
[45:47] The word that is needed for overcoming
[45:51] today.
[45:52] Tomorrow will take care of itself.
[45:55] Today we're just dealing with what we're
[45:57] dealing with and we're facing it as
[46:00] overcomers decreeing the word over it.
[46:03] We're not walking as defeated. We're
[46:05] asking the Lord for the daily provision
[46:09] for today that he'll do with us, in us,
[46:13] and for us exactly what we need to see
[46:17] this work all the way through that's
[46:19] already done.
[46:20] Amen.
[46:21] Watch it manifest before our eyes. I'm
[46:24] glad that he gives us daily bread.
[46:26] Aren't you?
[46:27] That's why it's our responsibility to
[46:29] spend time in the word in prayer and see
[46:32] him do what he does.
[46:35] Amen. Brother Cade's going to come and
[46:37] sing again today. He's already at the
[46:39] piano. We want to receive the tithe and
[46:41] the offering. We want to thank you for
[46:42] your giving. We did not specifically
[46:45] mention that we would receive a special
[46:47] offering for the building project today,
[46:50] but if you did bring one, just mark your
[46:53] envelope, building project, building
[46:54] fund, uh, there on the envelope, and
[46:57] it'll go in its proper place. We don't
[47:00] want to forget Jerusalem. The work is
[47:02] still going on there, though right at
[47:05] this moment, no one is in the apartment,
[47:07] but God knows what he's doing. and and
[47:10] we're standing believing that he has a
[47:13] work for us in Jerusalem in the nation
[47:15] of Israel. We continue to pray for her
[47:18] peace, believing God to do what he needs
[47:21] to do in that situation. Brother Elas,
[47:24] can I call on you and and Austin Yantis
[47:27] to go to the people today? And let's
[47:30] just pray over it before you go to the
[47:32] people. Father, I want to thank you for
[47:35] faithful people that give of their tithe
[47:38] and their offering. They keep covenant
[47:40] with you, Lord. We're asking you to
[47:43] bless them. Pour back into their homes.
[47:46] Lord, with our natural eyes, we see the
[47:49] the toughness of the economy right now.
[47:53] But God, we have been called to a higher
[47:55] calling. And we know that you said that
[47:58] you would provide for us if we kept
[48:01] covenant. Lord, you said to prove you.
[48:05] And so that is what we do with our tithe
[48:08] and offering. And Lord, we are people
[48:10] with expectation that you will pour out
[48:13] a blessing that we would not be able to
[48:16] contain. We will give you glory and
[48:19] honor Lord as as we give to you and you
[48:23] uh you provide miracles one after
[48:25] another. And it's in the name of the
[48:27] Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[48:31] God bless you as you give to the Lord
[48:33] today.
[48:36] Amen. We had a good weekend.
[48:38] Amen. I just know there's been things
[48:41] that happened in my life and things that
[48:43] happened in others life here in the past
[48:45] few weeks. And um that in itself should
[48:48] just be enough to just express to the
[48:50] Lord how you feel this morning. Um just
[48:53] sing of his goodness this morning.
[48:58] I love you, Lord,
[49:03] for your mercy never fails me.
[49:08] All my days
[49:11] I've been held in your hands.
[49:16] From the moment that I wake up
[49:20] until I lay my head.
[49:24] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[49:29] of God.
[49:32] [Music]

[1:03:19] There
[1:03:21] is only
[1:03:23] only one way
[1:03:26] to trust him,
[1:03:29] to touch him. You must believe
[1:03:34] when you call on
[1:03:37] his name.
[1:03:38] [Music]
[1:03:41] How many of you glad he's touchable?
[1:03:44] Aren't you glad that he's reachable?
[1:03:47] Give him one more hand clap of praise
[1:03:50] for now. God is good in this house.
[1:03:55] Oh, he's good.
[1:03:58] [Applause]
[1:03:59] All my life he's been faithful. You may
[1:04:02] be seated just a moment.
[1:04:06] God is good
[1:04:08] all the time.
[1:04:10] Aren't you glad of his goodness and for
[1:04:13] his goodness in your life.
[1:04:15] Well, we're just blessed today. Thank
[1:04:17] you for being in the house of the Lord.
[1:04:19] Thank you for helping to build an
[1:04:21] atmosphere for the Lord to move among
[1:04:23] us. Did you know he meets needs when we
[1:04:26] worship him?
[1:04:28] He visits us when we worship him.
[1:04:31] And so I'm believing that some of you
[1:04:33] have already touched him today
[1:04:35] and that he's already ministered to you
[1:04:38] because that's who he is.
[1:04:40] Those of you who are sleepy, well,
[1:04:42] you've just got to pinch yourself
[1:04:44] because the nap comes after lunch and
[1:04:46] not before lunch. Right?
[1:04:48] We still have some things that we want
[1:04:50] to share with you today. We want to uh
[1:04:53] thank God for what he did for us last
[1:04:56] night. And we want to thank the Lord for
[1:04:58] a comfortable place. It's not finished,
[1:05:01] but we have a comfortable place that we
[1:05:03] can have a meal together and fellowship.
[1:05:06] Oh, there are inconveniences.
[1:05:09] you know, there are things uh we don't
[1:05:11] have a lot of parking and we only have
[1:05:13] one way to get down there and so uh
[1:05:16] we're walking on the road and and
[1:05:19] there's just thing but you know we're
[1:05:21] just making steps making progress
[1:05:24] and it was just wonderful to have some
[1:05:27] time uh together last evening and I want
[1:05:30] to explain something to you all if
[1:05:32] you'll give me your attention for just a
[1:05:34] moment before we go to the word. I'm not
[1:05:37] always aware of what you do. I I'm not
[1:05:41] always here and I'm not always aware or
[1:05:45] informed about who is here doing what,
[1:05:48] what they've done, perhaps even what
[1:05:50] they donated. And so, if I don't mention
[1:05:54] it, it's likely because I don't know. I
[1:05:58] want to thank everyone of you who have
[1:06:01] worked so hard. Brother Greley leading
[1:06:05] the project, but he couldn't do it by
[1:06:08] himself. He can accomplish a lot by
[1:06:11] himself. But he couldn't do it all by
[1:06:14] himself. I know some of you have worked
[1:06:16] all day on your jobs and then come and
[1:06:18] worked in the evening. And I know that
[1:06:21] some of you have run to grab things from
[1:06:23] the store, paid for it, never turned in
[1:06:26] a receipt. I believe that God sees every
[1:06:30] effort that you make. And I believe that
[1:06:34] he will reward you accordingly.
[1:06:37] I don't know who cuts the grass always.
[1:06:39] I know Nathan has been uh uh leading
[1:06:42] that for so many years now. But I don't
[1:06:45] know who helps him. I don't know who we
[1:06:48] eats. I do know who who cut the shrubs
[1:06:51] because I begged him to cut them and he
[1:06:55] was willing to do it. But I don't always
[1:06:58] know what you do. But I want you to know
[1:07:00] that as a congregation, we thank you and
[1:07:03] we appreciate every sacrifice you make.
[1:07:07] You're taking care of the mothers who
[1:07:09] have just had babies. You're cooking
[1:07:10] meals. You're you you brought food last
[1:07:14] night and food today and it doesn't go
[1:07:17] unnoticed. I appreciate it. Um, there
[1:07:21] was one brother who spent hours of his
[1:07:24] time here this week. And to be
[1:07:28] completely honest with you, I didn't
[1:07:30] know he was doing it. I heard later, but
[1:07:33] it was it was a mess. He stepped into a
[1:07:37] mess down there. And I was absolutely
[1:07:40] amazed when I was told that he had spent
[1:07:43] most of the day cleaning and working.
[1:07:46] And you know, sometimes you think a man
[1:07:48] doesn't know too much about cleaning,
[1:07:50] right?
[1:07:52] Don't let them fool you, sisters.
[1:07:57] There's at least one eligible brother,
[1:08:02] unmarried,
[1:08:03] who knows how to clean.
[1:08:06] And uh when I walked in there, there was
[1:08:09] mud everywhere. There was bird, you
[1:08:12] know, droppings. And there were no birds
[1:08:15] flying around at that time, but you
[1:08:18] could certainly see where they had been
[1:08:19] flying around. And I simply backed out
[1:08:22] the door. I walked in, I saw it, I lost
[1:08:27] my breath, and I just backed out the
[1:08:29] door. And in my mind, I'm thinking, how?
[1:08:32] I don't I wouldn't even know what to do
[1:08:35] first to start this. But, you know,
[1:08:38] someone took a burden and and and I
[1:08:42] assume purchased things out of their own
[1:08:45] pocket to to make it so much easier for
[1:08:49] those of you who came in Saturday night.
[1:08:51] And I'm so thankful for Brother Greley.
[1:08:54] I'm so thankful for what he's doing.
[1:08:56] And uh he saw one mop wasn't going to be
[1:09:00] uh sufficient. So, he sends them for
[1:09:02] mops and buckets and and and what needs
[1:09:05] to be done. and then I just come and
[1:09:07] enjoy it. And I want you to know one
[1:09:10] more time that it doesn't go unnoticed
[1:09:12] as a whole body. We thank you for
[1:09:16] everything that you're doing. Uh let's
[1:09:19] do that. Yes.
[1:09:21] [Applause]
[1:09:27] One one brother put up a heavy plastic
[1:09:29] and I mean he taped it up and he had uh
[1:09:34] two befores in it so that it wouldn't
[1:09:36] blow away and and that was sufficient
[1:09:38] for for a day or two to certainly keep
[1:09:41] the birds out and the next thing you
[1:09:43] know a door appears there in the spot
[1:09:47] and so I just appreciate what you're
[1:09:49] doing. That's not the permanent door,
[1:09:51] but that's the door that gets the
[1:09:53] brothers through construction so that a
[1:09:55] 2x4 doesn't go through the glass door.
[1:09:58] Ain't that smart?
[1:10:00] So, and brother Gley, you know, he put
[1:10:03] put those window units, small window
[1:10:06] units in and that wasn't doing the job
[1:10:08] and it came to him about the fans and he
[1:10:11] put the big fans up and it made it quite
[1:10:13] comfortable. Maybe a little hotter
[1:10:15] today, but we're going to make it,
[1:10:17] aren't we,
[1:10:18] pastor? You're taking a lot of time. I
[1:10:20] know.
[1:10:22] But I want you to know. I want you to
[1:10:25] know. If you're doing something to be
[1:10:27] noticed, I don't think you are. But
[1:10:30] should you do that, you'll be
[1:10:32] disappointed around here because we may
[1:10:35] not know you did it. But if you're doing
[1:10:38] it unto the Lord, I know that God sees
[1:10:41] it.
[1:10:42] I I was I was sitting there thinking
[1:10:45] about the song we were singing. Your
[1:10:46] goodness is running after me. The
[1:10:49] psalmist said, "Surely goodness and
[1:10:52] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[1:10:56] life, and I will dwell in the house of
[1:10:59] the Lord forever."
[1:11:01] That that to follow is a is a good uh
[1:11:05] expression from the King James, but that
[1:11:07] does not really touch the Hebrew. In
[1:11:10] Hebrew, it's not talking about, you
[1:11:13] know, someone coming along behind you
[1:11:15] and tiptoeing in the tulips. And it's
[1:11:18] it's talking about someone chasing you
[1:11:22] and and apprehending you, laying hold on
[1:11:26] you is is the is the expression in the
[1:11:29] Hebrew. So surely goodness and mercy
[1:11:32] shall chase me down and apprehend me,
[1:11:36] overwhelm me, overcome me all the days
[1:11:40] of my life. Aren't you thankful?
[1:11:43] And then my mind went to to the psalmist
[1:11:46] saying, I'd rather be a doorkeeper
[1:11:49] in the house of the Lord for one day
[1:11:53] than to dwell in the tents of evil or
[1:11:56] wicked forever.
[1:11:58] We ought to be thankful for every
[1:12:00] opportunity that we have to gather in
[1:12:03] his name.
[1:12:04] Amen. And uh I know we've got a we have
[1:12:08] a kitchen. You know, we were scrambling
[1:12:10] around. My wife was thinking about ice
[1:12:12] and we were going to need some more ice.
[1:12:14] And you know what I just said to her?
[1:12:17] One of these days
[1:12:18] Yes, sir.
[1:12:19] may not be too long from now. We don't
[1:12:22] know what God's doing, how he's going to
[1:12:23] do it. We're going to have an ice
[1:12:25] machine
[1:12:27] and we're never going to have to run out
[1:12:29] at the last minute and buy ice cubes
[1:12:31] again cuz we'll make them. Well, that
[1:12:34] don't mean much to everybody cuz you
[1:12:35] don't have to worry about whether
[1:12:37] there's ice or not.
[1:12:38] But it means something to me
[1:12:41] to even think that we're getting to a
[1:12:43] place where we can have what we need. So
[1:12:46] anyway, thank you so much, brother Cade.
[1:12:48] Thank you for always being available.
[1:12:51] They asked me, "Are there any songs
[1:12:52] turned in?" No, I've not had any,
[1:12:54] Benjamin. No, I haven't had any.
[1:13:00] And so I appreciate him not having to
[1:13:03] have a long notice. Amen.
[1:13:06] That's the benefit of being able to play
[1:13:08] for yourself. You don't have to always
[1:13:10] worry about having someone to play for
[1:13:13] you. You just jump up and get it done.
[1:13:15] But we're missing some of the rest of
[1:13:17] you singers, Brother Josh, uh, Alano,
[1:13:20] and no different ones. I I still love to
[1:13:24] hear Sister Anna Christine and and and
[1:13:26] Austin. He don't mess her up too bad.
[1:13:29] And uh you God lays a song on your
[1:13:32] heart, let us know. If we can place it
[1:13:34] in the lineup, we will. Sometimes we are
[1:13:38] already getting a a sort of a theme
[1:13:40] together. And uh and so sometimes a song
[1:13:43] might not work in the right spot, but we
[1:13:46] we know there'll be a place for it.
[1:13:49] Amen. If if we're being led to the
[1:13:51] throne in worship, perhaps to lay at his
[1:13:54] feet, well, it might not we might not
[1:13:56] need a warfare song in that service, we
[1:13:59] may need a a worshipful song. Do you
[1:14:02] understand?
[1:14:03] And but sometimes when we're stirred up
[1:14:05] and the devil's mad and we're glad he's
[1:14:07] mad and we want to do something about
[1:14:09] it, let him know we're not a bunch of
[1:14:10] pushovers, that's the right time
[1:14:13] to war
[1:14:15] to go to war. Sometimes you have to be
[1:14:18] extra sensitive to even know what season
[1:14:20] you're in.
[1:14:21] Aren't you glad for the discernment of
[1:14:23] the Holy Spirit.
[1:14:25] Miles, otherwise known as Milo,
[1:14:29] turns three years old today.
[1:14:33] Happy birthday.
[1:14:36] [Applause]
[1:14:38] Th three
[1:14:41] years old.
[1:14:43] And tomorrow, Brother Anthony Chadwick,
[1:14:46] who's streaming the service with Sister
[1:14:48] Cindy, uh, tomorrow is his birthday. We
[1:14:51] want to say happy birthday to Brother
[1:14:53] Anthony.
[1:14:55] And we appreciate y'all.
[1:15:00] Monday is also Maya Yovich's birthday.
[1:15:04] Is she in here somewhere? Where is she?
[1:15:06] Hold up your hand, Maya. Oh, make her
[1:15:09] hold her hand up, Chad.
[1:15:11] You mean you couldn't get her hand up as
[1:15:13] little as she is? Oh, she's turning
[1:15:16] colors.
[1:15:17] How old is Maya going to be? Four. Four
[1:15:21] years old. I don't think anybody ought
[1:15:23] to be embarrassed if they're four.
[1:15:26] It's some of them bigger numbers that
[1:15:28] you might not want told. And Sister
[1:15:31] Beverly, I noticed that uh that Monday
[1:15:33] would also uh be your wedding
[1:15:36] anniversary. And you were married. I
[1:15:38] can't forget you were married the year I
[1:15:40] was born. So that's a long time ago. And
[1:15:43] uh I I'm so thankful that
[1:15:47] 57 years. And we're just thankful,
[1:15:50] thankful, thankful, thankful. And uh we
[1:15:54] think of brother Skipworth often and the
[1:15:56] guitar
[1:15:58] and the songs that he had to sing for
[1:16:01] the Lord. Tuesday is a pretty special
[1:16:04] day for me. That's my wife's birthday
[1:16:06] and uh it grieves me that she'll never
[1:16:08] be uh as old as I am. At the same time,
[1:16:12] I married me a younger woman. Just want
[1:16:15] you all to know. And uh I want to say
[1:16:18] happy birthday to my wife. She is
[1:16:19] amazing. Absolutely amazing.
[1:16:23] [Applause]
[1:16:27] And uh Austin uh where is Austin?
[1:16:30] Where's Austin? Yantis in the sound
[1:16:33] booth. You're not nearly as amazing as
[1:16:35] my wife,
[1:16:37] but you share a birthday with her, and I
[1:16:39] want to wish you a very happy birthday,
[1:16:41] too. God bless you.
[1:16:47] On the stream, there's amazing picture
[1:16:49] of the backs of the computers because
[1:16:51] he's hiding his face. Maybe he's one of
[1:16:54] those in those higher numbers that's
[1:16:56] embarrassed about his I don't know.
[1:16:58] Let's stand. Let's thank God for these
[1:17:00] musicians.
[1:17:02] We won't have any more singing for now.
[1:17:08] Turn to Mark chapter 11 in your Bible.
[1:17:12] And I want to read those two verses that
[1:17:14] we that we started with last evening.
[1:17:18] And then I'm going to let you have your
[1:17:20] seats if you promise to stay awake. And
[1:17:23] I'm going to read two longer portions of
[1:17:26] scripture because I want you to have the
[1:17:28] full context of the story. But in Mark
[1:17:31] 11:23,
[1:17:33] the scripture, this is all red letters.
[1:17:35] It's Jesus talking to us. For verily I
[1:17:39] say unto you, that whosoever shall say
[1:17:43] unto this mountain, be thou removed, and
[1:17:46] be thou cast into the sea. Now listen,
[1:17:50] this is the this is the kicker. And
[1:17:54] shall not doubt in his heart.
[1:17:59] Now, there's a time that we can get by
[1:18:03] with that little creeping unbelief that
[1:18:05] we have to keep pulling down. But when
[1:18:08] you're speaking to mountains,
[1:18:10] there cannot be any unbelief, any doubt
[1:18:15] in your heart at that moment. That's
[1:18:17] what Jesus is saying. Whosoever shall
[1:18:20] say unto this mountain, Be thou removed,
[1:18:23] and be thou cast into the sea, and shall
[1:18:26] not doubt in his heart, but shall
[1:18:30] believe that those things which he saith
[1:18:36] shall come to pass. No doubt, shall come
[1:18:42] to pass. He shall have whatsoever
[1:18:47] he saith.
[1:18:50] Glory to God.
[1:18:51] Well, well, pastor, I spoke something
[1:18:54] and it didn't happen. There's a key
[1:18:57] here. This isn't for all prayer. We're
[1:19:01] not talking about all prayer.
[1:19:03] We're talking about prayer with bridal
[1:19:07] authority.
[1:19:08] We understand that there is creative
[1:19:11] power. I know you're standing. There is
[1:19:14] creative power when the word of God is
[1:19:17] spoken from the mouth, from the heart of
[1:19:20] the believer. That word is alive.
[1:19:23] It's not words on a page. It's a living
[1:19:26] word.
[1:19:27] It's the reality of Jesus Christ. And
[1:19:30] when we speak that living word, the
[1:19:33] living word within us witnesses to that
[1:19:36] which is being spoken. And if there is
[1:19:39] no doubt in our heart, this is not an
[1:19:41] easy place.
[1:19:42] Hallelujah.
[1:19:43] This is not an easy place to get to. You
[1:19:45] you've got to shut your spiritual ears
[1:19:48] to anything but God's voice
[1:19:50] because the devil will be talking to
[1:19:52] you.
[1:19:53] He'll tell you why that's just not even
[1:19:55] possible. I don't even know how God
[1:19:57] could do that if he wanted to. So
[1:20:00] there's no room in a moment like this.
[1:20:03] There is no room for doubt in our heart.
[1:20:06] And if we can clear all of that out,
[1:20:09] Jesus said, this is not a preacher
[1:20:12] somewhere. This is Jesus who said, you
[1:20:15] shall have whatsoever
[1:20:18] he saith, whatsoever you speak.
[1:20:21] Therefore, I say unto you, what
[1:20:25] thingsoever ye desire when you pray,
[1:20:30] this is another another communication.
[1:20:33] When you pray, believe that ye receive
[1:20:37] them, and ye shall
[1:20:40] have them. May God add his blessing to
[1:20:42] the reading of his word. You may be
[1:20:44] seated. I'm asking you to stay with me
[1:20:46] this morning to the best of your
[1:20:48] ability. That faith pull is a very
[1:20:51] important part of what we're about to do
[1:20:53] now. Your pull on the word of God. your
[1:20:57] amen. Not just your silent one, but the
[1:21:01] one that slips out of your mouth is
[1:21:04] recorded. I believe it's recorded in
[1:21:06] heaven.
[1:21:07] I believe in the power of your amen.
[1:21:11] I believe your amen makes the word of
[1:21:13] God personal to you. I believe when you
[1:21:17] hear a truth that you believe in and you
[1:21:20] say amen, you don't have to scream it so
[1:21:22] loud you send other people off the pew,
[1:21:25] but you speak it out of your mouth. And
[1:21:29] that word means amen means what
[1:21:32] it means so be it.
[1:21:34] And because it's a personal expression
[1:21:36] between you and the Lord, you're
[1:21:38] actually saying and so let it be in my
[1:21:41] life. I believe that's the truth. and so
[1:21:44] let it be in my life. So many times when
[1:21:46] the word of God goes forth, we
[1:21:48] disqualify ourselves from receiving it.
[1:21:52] And we think of all the reasons why
[1:21:54] we're not worthy of that promise or why
[1:21:57] we may not have that in our life or why
[1:22:00] what we have done or the mistakes that
[1:22:02] we have made. When I was standing up
[1:22:04] here earlier, the Lord reminded me of a
[1:22:07] quotation. And I may not read it now,
[1:22:09] but he reminded me of something brother
[1:22:11] Brandham said about mistakes. And he
[1:22:13] said, "Your mistake in this context,
[1:22:16] your mistake doesn't matter."
[1:22:20] God's not looking at your mistake. He's
[1:22:23] looking at your faith.
[1:22:25] So Jesus is giving us two aspects here.
[1:22:29] He's giving us two dimensions of prayer
[1:22:32] and intercession. One is not asking, one
[1:22:36] is speaking.
[1:22:38] And the other is asking in prayer. If
[1:22:41] you're going to speak the word, Jesus
[1:22:44] says the prerequisite for doing that is
[1:22:47] to make sure that there is no doubt,
[1:22:52] no doubt in your heart. Otherwise, you
[1:22:55] pray and you ask the Lord, Lord, I
[1:22:58] believe, help thou my unbelief. That's
[1:23:02] how we should pray. We should really
[1:23:04] pray that way now. Lord, I know you can.
[1:23:07] I believe you will. I I I do. But help
[1:23:10] me. Help me in my unbelief. Help me in
[1:23:13] my doubt. But if you're going to rise
[1:23:15] up, and the bride will. The prophet told
[1:23:18] us that in that last day the bride will
[1:23:22] have thus saith the Lord.
[1:23:27] And she will keep still until she has
[1:23:30] thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:23:32] And when she has it, she will do exactly
[1:23:35] what is spoken. And God will bring that
[1:23:39] to pass in her life.
[1:23:41] So, we're going to shake some mountains
[1:23:43] in the last of the last days. And we're
[1:23:45] shaking mountains now through prayer.
[1:23:48] But we're coming to a place of
[1:23:50] recognized authority. Is anybody here?
[1:23:53] When we begin to recognize our
[1:23:55] authority, it won't be asking anymore.
[1:23:58] It won't be begging or petitioning
[1:24:00] anymore, but a revelation will rise up
[1:24:03] in your heart. This is the will of God.
[1:24:07] And you will decree a thing, the Bible
[1:24:09] said. And what you decree without doubt
[1:24:13] in your heart will will it has to come
[1:24:18] to pass.
[1:24:19] Are you with me?
[1:24:21] So I want us to to turn. If you if you
[1:24:25] read along in your Bible, that's great.
[1:24:28] If not, they'll have it on the screen.
[1:24:30] God bless all of you streamers. Thank
[1:24:33] you for all your greetings. We see your
[1:24:37] prayer request. Uh God bless you in the
[1:24:40] Philippines, in uh Norway, in so many
[1:24:44] different places. And we we will pray.
[1:24:46] We will help you pray. We'll join our
[1:24:49] faith with yours over these requests. I
[1:24:52] want to go to Luke chapter 1. And uh I I
[1:24:56] I hesitate to read long portions of
[1:24:59] scripture because I know that our
[1:25:02] attention span can be extremely short in
[1:25:06] 2024. I'm asking you to stretch it for
[1:25:09] just a moment because I want you to
[1:25:12] grasp the context of these verses. Luke
[1:25:15] chapter 1 verse 5. There was in the days
[1:25:19] of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain
[1:25:22] priest named Zachcharias of the course
[1:25:25] of Abia, and his wife was of the
[1:25:28] daughters of Aaron, and her name was
[1:25:32] it was Elizabeth
[1:25:34] uh Elishva. And they were both righteous
[1:25:38] before God, walking in all the
[1:25:41] commandments and ordinances of the Lord,
[1:25:44] blameless.
[1:25:46] That's having a pure heart before the
[1:25:48] Lord, real consecration and dedication.
[1:25:51] And they had no child because that
[1:25:54] Elizabeth was barren. And they both were
[1:25:57] now well stricken in years.
[1:26:02] Somebody had been trying a long time.
[1:26:08] Now it seemed as though there was no
[1:26:11] reason to even believe.
[1:26:14] The cycles of her body were failing
[1:26:19] and there was no reason to believe that
[1:26:23] they would ever bear a child.
[1:26:27] Well stricken, both of them in years.
[1:26:30] And it came to pass that while he
[1:26:33] Zachcharias executed the priest's office
[1:26:37] before God in the order of his course
[1:26:41] according to the custom of the priest's
[1:26:44] office. His lot was to burn incense when
[1:26:49] he went into the temple of the Lord. I
[1:26:52] believe many of you understand that the
[1:26:54] the priest served in courses and they
[1:26:59] would draw a lot to see what a course of
[1:27:03] priest what duty they would perform in
[1:27:07] the temple at a certain time in the
[1:27:09] cycle. And so it was the lot of
[1:27:12] Zachcharias and his course. The Bible
[1:27:16] tells us that they were to burn incense
[1:27:20] in the temple of the Lord. He goes on,
[1:27:23] "And the whole multitude of the people
[1:27:25] were praying without at the time of
[1:27:29] incense." I don't know if you know this
[1:27:31] or not, but the congregation of Israel
[1:27:34] would often gather in the outer court of
[1:27:37] the temple and they would make their
[1:27:39] prayers known to God at the precise
[1:27:43] moment that the priest was burning
[1:27:46] incense in the inside in the temple in
[1:27:49] the holy place. And they believed that
[1:27:53] what the priest was doing was symbolic.
[1:27:56] He was sending the smoke, the fragrance
[1:27:59] of the incense up toward God and that
[1:28:02] the people were praying at the same
[1:28:05] time. And it was as though their prayers
[1:28:08] were rising on the smoke of that incense
[1:28:11] as it went to the Lord. That's our
[1:28:14] praise. Remember, sometimes we'll say,
[1:28:16] "Let's spread our hands as they did in
[1:28:19] the evening sacrifice." It was it was an
[1:28:22] opportunity for them to lift up their
[1:28:25] hands and give offerings to God in
[1:28:29] praise while the priests were inside the
[1:28:32] temple carrying out the work and
[1:28:35] ministry of the temple. And so the
[1:28:38] people were praying and the smoke of the
[1:28:40] incense was rising. I can almost see
[1:28:43] that in my mind's eye. And there
[1:28:46] appeared unto him, Zachcharias, an angel
[1:28:49] of the Lord standing on the right side
[1:28:53] of the altar of incense. If I had enough
[1:28:57] time, I could preach a long time. No
[1:29:00] doubt you know that on this verse, it
[1:29:04] strikes me as so powerful. where the
[1:29:08] angel was standing. He was standing
[1:29:10] where the incense was rising up to God
[1:29:15] in praise and in intercession. And so we
[1:29:18] read on, "And when Zachcharias saw him,
[1:29:23] he was troubled and fear fell upon him."
[1:29:28] Don't criticize Zachcharias.
[1:29:31] You might would do the same thing. If an
[1:29:34] angel appeared to you, and many have
[1:29:36] seen angels, you don't have to see them
[1:29:38] for them to be present,
[1:29:40] but many have seen angels in various
[1:29:43] forms. And it will strike a chord of
[1:29:47] fear into your into your heart. And
[1:29:50] that's why they usually show up with a
[1:29:52] message,
[1:29:55] fear not,
[1:29:57] neither be thou afraid. because their
[1:29:59] holy presence brings an awe and a fear
[1:30:04] into the atmosphere. But the angel said
[1:30:06] unto him, "Fear not, Zachcharias, for
[1:30:10] thy prayer is heard,
[1:30:13] and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a
[1:30:17] son, and thou shalt call his name
[1:30:20] Yohanan or John, and thou shalt have joy
[1:30:25] and gladness, and many shall rejoice at
[1:30:29] his birth, for he shall be great in the
[1:30:33] sight of the Lord." Are you there? Amen.
[1:30:35] He shall be great in the sight of the
[1:30:37] Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor
[1:30:40] strong drink. And he shall be filled,
[1:30:43] this is powerful, this hasn't happened
[1:30:46] before, he shall be filled with the Holy
[1:30:50] Ghost even from his mother's womb.
[1:30:55] Can you imagine?
[1:30:57] Can you imagine? Not after birth, not as
[1:31:00] a age of accountability, but even in his
[1:31:03] mother's belly, he will be filled with
[1:31:07] the Holy Ghost.
[1:31:09] That right there ought to be enough for
[1:31:11] you to understand that life is sacred on
[1:31:14] both sides, inside the mother's womb and
[1:31:17] outside the mother's womb.
[1:31:20] And so he goes on, "And many of the
[1:31:23] children of Israel shall he, John, turn
[1:31:26] to the Lord their God, and he shall go
[1:31:30] before him in the spirit and power of
[1:31:34] Elias, Elijah, to turn the hearts of the
[1:31:38] fathers to the children, and the
[1:31:41] disobedient to the wisdom of the just."
[1:31:45] Notice he's not quoting the entire
[1:31:48] Malachi prophecy. He's only quoting a
[1:31:52] portion of Malachi's prophecy that the
[1:31:55] spirit of Elijah would forun the second
[1:31:58] coming of the Lord. And the disobedient
[1:32:01] to the wisdom of the just to make ready
[1:32:04] a people prepared for the Lord. How many
[1:32:06] of you would agree John had a great
[1:32:08] commission on his life?
[1:32:10] He really did. Let's go on. And
[1:32:13] Zachcharias said unto the angel,
[1:32:15] "Whereby shall I know this?"
[1:32:20] I don't even understand the King James
[1:32:23] in that verse.
[1:32:26] Whether whereby shall I know this,
[1:32:30] for I am an old man and my wife well
[1:32:34] stricken in years. You may not
[1:32:37] understand the old English of that, but
[1:32:39] the angel did.
[1:32:41] Come on.
[1:32:42] The angel knew exactly what Zacharias
[1:32:44] was saying. And by the way, Zachcharias
[1:32:46] wasn't speaking in in the king's English
[1:32:48] in that moment. Anyway, the angel knew
[1:32:51] exactly what he meant. I I want to read
[1:32:53] that for you before we go on. I'm afraid
[1:32:55] I'm going to lose you in reading this.
[1:32:58] But in the complete Jewish Bible, Dr.
[1:33:00] Stern says it this way. How can I be
[1:33:04] sure of this?
[1:33:07] An angel
[1:33:08] [Music]
[1:33:10] is standing in his midst. He must have
[1:33:12] carried a presence of authority. Because
[1:33:15] Zachcharias was terrified.
[1:33:17] The angel said, "Fear not. I'm going to
[1:33:19] give you a child." Your prayers have
[1:33:22] been answered.
[1:33:23] And that's like us. We pray and then we
[1:33:25] get surprised.
[1:33:28] When God moves on the scene,
[1:33:30] we say we believe and then when God does
[1:33:32] it, we wow,
[1:33:35] I wasn't expecting that. Well, what were
[1:33:37] you praying for?
[1:33:39] And so how can I be sure of this? For I
[1:33:42] am an old man. My wife too is well in
[1:33:46] years.
[1:33:48] And then the amplified said, "By what
[1:33:51] shall I know and be sure of this?
[1:33:56] How can I be sure that what you tell me
[1:34:00] is the truth?" Somebody say, "Wrong
[1:34:02] answer."
[1:34:04] That's the wrong answer.
[1:34:06] It grieved the angel.
[1:34:09] You remember the rest of the story? How
[1:34:11] by what shall I know and be sure of
[1:34:13] this? For I am an old man and my wife is
[1:34:16] well advanced in years. I like the fact
[1:34:19] that he smoothed it out when he was
[1:34:21] talking about his wife.
[1:34:23] He was old. She was well advanced in
[1:34:25] years.
[1:34:27] The the So, the gest of verse uh verse
[1:34:32] 18 here is how can I be sure of this?
[1:34:35] How am I going to know this is real?
[1:34:38] How am I going to know this is the real
[1:34:40] deal? For I'm an old man. And the angel
[1:34:42] answering said unto him, I am Gabriel.
[1:34:46] I am Gabriel.
[1:34:49] A and I have stood in the presence of
[1:34:51] God. And I am sent to speak unto thee
[1:34:56] and to show thee these glad tidings.
[1:35:01] And behold, thou shalt be dumb and not
[1:35:06] able to speak. Do you know why?
[1:35:10] Because he said the wrong thing,
[1:35:14] did you know there's a penalty?
[1:35:17] Did you know there's a price to pay?
[1:35:19] Anybody here
[1:35:21] for saying the wrong thing?
[1:35:24] This this man paid a price. You're going
[1:35:27] to be struck dumb until the day that
[1:35:30] these things shall be performed. You
[1:35:32] know what God was doing? He was saying,
[1:35:34] "There's one thing for sure. You'll
[1:35:36] never speak another word out of the out
[1:35:37] of doubt out of your mouth until I
[1:35:40] fulfill this promise in your life. I'm
[1:35:42] not going to let your mouth keep you
[1:35:44] from receiving the promise. It's a done
[1:35:46] deal because I said so.
[1:35:48] You don't know how it's going to happen,
[1:35:50] but I know it's going to happen. So,
[1:35:52] you're going to be I'm going to shut
[1:35:54] your mouth. I'm going to lock your lips
[1:35:57] and then I'm going to do what I said I
[1:35:59] was going to do and I'll loose your
[1:36:00] tongue. I like that. Lord have mercy.
[1:36:04] Maybe some of us need some of that lock
[1:36:07] jaw
[1:36:08] so we'll quit talking ourselves out of
[1:36:11] the blessing.
[1:36:13] Oh, I'm preaching to somebody.
[1:36:16] We keep talking ourselves out of the
[1:36:19] blessing when we need to be talking
[1:36:21] ourselves into the blessing.
[1:36:25] You you God is trying to qualify you in
[1:36:28] faith and you're disqualifying yourself.
[1:36:32] Oh my. Don't do it. Don't let your My
[1:36:36] mama used to say, "Don't let your mouth
[1:36:38] overload the rest of you. Come on now.
[1:36:43] Don't let your mouth run to the extent
[1:36:47] that you miss your opportunity to see
[1:36:50] your promise.
[1:36:54] We're talking about receiving a divine
[1:36:57] promise in fulfillment, in
[1:37:00] materialization,
[1:37:02] in manifestation from the Lord. So, uh
[1:37:05] be and listen to what he says. uh you
[1:37:07] won't talk until these things shall be
[1:37:09] performed because thou believe not my
[1:37:12] words
[1:37:13] which shall be fulfilled in their
[1:37:14] season.
[1:37:15] You see, there is a time
[1:37:18] that God's going to do it
[1:37:21] whether you like it or not.
[1:37:24] Yes, sir.
[1:37:24] That's what God was saying to
[1:37:26] Zachcharias. I'm not doing this because
[1:37:27] you believe.
[1:37:29] I'm doing this because it's my plan to
[1:37:31] do it, but I'm not going to let you talk
[1:37:33] against it.
[1:37:35] I like that. Yes, sir.
[1:37:37] These things are going to be fulfilled
[1:37:38] in their season. And the people waited
[1:37:41] for Zachcharias and marveled that he
[1:37:43] terried so long in the temple. He was
[1:37:46] one of those in there, get the work done
[1:37:48] and out kind of folk.
[1:37:50] You know, the kind you never get to
[1:37:52] speak to.
[1:37:53] Cuz they're in there and then out. You
[1:37:55] know how that goes sometime.
[1:37:57] They weren't used to Zachcharias
[1:37:58] lingering.
[1:38:00] There was a young brother lingering here
[1:38:02] in the presence of the Lord last night,
[1:38:04] weeping before God. and and some of them
[1:38:07] around fellowship began to miss that he
[1:38:09] was there a a and come looking for him
[1:38:12] because he was lingering a little while.
[1:38:15] There's nothing wrong with that sometime
[1:38:18] lingering a little while in the presence
[1:38:21] of God. So uh when he came out they
[1:38:24] found out he could not speak to them and
[1:38:26] they perceived that he had seen a vision
[1:38:28] in the temple for he beckoned unto them
[1:38:31] and remained speechless.
[1:38:34] And it came to pass that as soon as the
[1:38:36] days of his ministration were
[1:38:38] accomplished, he departed to his own
[1:38:42] house. And after those days, his wife
[1:38:44] Elizabeth conceived.
[1:38:48] Surprise.
[1:38:50] God did what he said he was going to do,
[1:38:53] even though Zachariah said the wrong
[1:38:55] thing. And she hid herself five months,
[1:38:59] saying, "Thus hath the Lord dealt with
[1:39:02] me in the days wherein he looked on me
[1:39:05] to take away my reproach among men. Thus
[1:39:09] hath the Lord dealt with me in the days
[1:39:12] wherein he looked on me to take away my
[1:39:17] reproach among men." Now, I want you to
[1:39:20] drop down to ver to the next verse,
[1:39:22] verse 26. I know this is, you know,
[1:39:26] timeconsuming,
[1:39:27] but I can't really believe that every
[1:39:30] one of you would go home and and read
[1:39:32] this. I I don't have full confidence in
[1:39:35] your homework uh assignments.
[1:39:38] So, I'm taking the time to read it for
[1:39:40] you if you'll forgive me. And in the
[1:39:42] sixth month, the angel Gabriel, same
[1:39:45] angel, was sent from God unto a city of
[1:39:48] Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin, a
[1:39:52] spouse to a man whose name was Joseph or
[1:39:56] Yoseph of the house of David. And the
[1:39:59] virgin's name was Miriam or Mary. And
[1:40:04] the angel came in unto her and said,
[1:40:06] "Hail, thou art that art highly favored.
[1:40:11] the Lord. It's a salute.
[1:40:14] It's a salutation. Hail thou that art
[1:40:17] highly favored. The Lord is with thee.
[1:40:21] Blessed art thou among women. And when
[1:40:26] she saw him, guess what? She had the
[1:40:29] same response. She was troubled at his
[1:40:32] saying and cast in her mind what manner
[1:40:37] of salutation this should be. And the
[1:40:40] angel said unto her,
[1:40:44] "Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found
[1:40:48] favor with God. And behold, thou shalt
[1:40:52] conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a
[1:40:54] son, and shall call his name Yeshua,
[1:40:58] Jesus.
[1:40:59] He shall be great. He shall be called
[1:41:02] the son of the highest. And the Lord God
[1:41:04] shall give unto him the throne of his
[1:41:08] father David." Oh, that's powerful. And
[1:41:10] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[1:41:12] forever and of his kingdom. Look at
[1:41:14] that. There shall
[1:41:16] be no end. Then said Mary unto the
[1:41:20] angel.
[1:41:24] She asked a question too.
[1:41:26] But her question was so different than
[1:41:30] the question that Zachcharias asked. She
[1:41:34] simply said, "How shall this be, seeing
[1:41:38] I know not a man?"
[1:41:42] You see, the angel Gabriel knew that
[1:41:45] this was a reasonable question.
[1:41:48] Just follow me a moment.
[1:41:50] There is a natural order of conception.
[1:41:53] And it was a reasonable uh question for
[1:41:56] her to ask the angel, "How am I going to
[1:41:58] bear a child seeing that I have not been
[1:42:01] intimate with any man?" There was no
[1:42:03] offense to the word of the Lord for
[1:42:05] asking a simple question. And the angel
[1:42:08] answered and said unto her, the Holy
[1:42:10] Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
[1:42:12] power of the highest shall overshadow
[1:42:15] thee. Therefore also that holy thing
[1:42:17] which shall be born of thee shall be
[1:42:20] called,
[1:42:23] the son of God.
[1:42:26] Oh my goodness.
[1:42:28] And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth,
[1:42:31] remember her?
[1:42:32] She hath also conceived a son in her old
[1:42:35] age, and this is the sixth month. You
[1:42:37] know, the angel Gabriel wasn't as
[1:42:39] gracious as Zacharias was. The angel
[1:42:41] called her old age. She's old.
[1:42:45] And this is the sixth month with her who
[1:42:47] was called barren. God changed her name,
[1:42:50] didn't he?
[1:42:51] For with God, look at this.
[1:42:54] For with God, Zachcharias, you need to
[1:42:57] hear this. For with God nothing shall be
[1:43:01] impossible.
[1:43:03] Warrior bride, you need to hear this
[1:43:05] this morning. For with God nothing shall
[1:43:09] be impossible.
[1:43:12] And Mary said,
[1:43:13] "Hallelujah.
[1:43:16] Behold
[1:43:18] the handmade of the Lord."
[1:43:21] Yeah.
[1:43:23] Be it unto me
[1:43:26] according to thy word. And the angel
[1:43:29] departed from her.
[1:43:36] It's powerful.
[1:43:38] In the message led by the Holy Spirit. I
[1:43:41] want you to listen carefully. He said,
[1:43:44] "Watch. When the angel of the Lord met
[1:43:46] Zachcharias and told him up there he was
[1:43:48] going to have a son by his wife
[1:43:50] Elizabeth." Why? He said, "These things
[1:43:53] can't be.
[1:43:55] She's too old and I'm old." He said,
[1:43:58] "I'm Gabriel that stands at the right
[1:44:01] hand of God and in his presence. Because
[1:44:03] you doubted my words, you'll be dumb
[1:44:05] till the day the baby's born. For my
[1:44:07] word is going to be fulfilled in its
[1:44:11] season." That's another message I want
[1:44:14] to give the little bride today. The word
[1:44:17] of the Lord is going to be fulfilled in
[1:44:21] your life in its season if you can shut
[1:44:25] up your mouth and not doubt.
[1:44:29] If you can say the right thing instead
[1:44:33] of the wrong thing, God will do exactly
[1:44:38] what he said he was going to do for you.
[1:44:41] If God told you he had given you a
[1:44:43] companion, you hold on to the promise of
[1:44:47] God and believe that in the right
[1:44:50] season, in the due time, God will keep
[1:44:53] his word.
[1:44:56] He might not furnish you with number 2,
[1:44:58] 3, four, five, and six.
[1:45:02] Just a minute.
[1:45:04] Amen, brother.
[1:45:08] But he's got one for you.
[1:45:11] You can hold on to that promise.
[1:45:13] Yeah.
[1:45:14] Then he was stricken dumb till the day
[1:45:16] the child was born. They called him
[1:45:18] John. His mother did. And they said
[1:45:21] called her up a writing tablet for him.
[1:45:24] They asked her, "What are you going to
[1:45:25] name him?" And she she said, "You got to
[1:45:27] ask him." They got a writing tablet for
[1:45:30] him to write. He said his name he should
[1:45:33] he said his name is John God.
[1:45:37] Amen.
[1:45:38] I'm not going to preach on that. God had
[1:45:41] already named him.
[1:45:43] You parents, why don't you wait and hear
[1:45:46] from the Lord?
[1:45:48] Instead of naming him some fuzzy hippie
[1:45:51] name,
[1:45:52] [Music]
[1:45:54] why don't you seek the Lord and let him
[1:45:57] drop a name in your heart? Because the
[1:46:00] reality is God has likely named that
[1:46:03] child before it got here.
[1:46:06] So, you're not looking to Hollywood to
[1:46:08] figure out what to name him or some
[1:46:11] sports star somewhere. You're asking for
[1:46:14] the leadership of the Lord because
[1:46:16] there's a destiny connected to a name.
[1:46:20] When you put a name on a child, you you
[1:46:23] are establishing something in their
[1:46:25] future.
[1:46:27] So, you're not looking at a name book.
[1:46:29] You're not googling trendy names in
[1:46:32] 2024.
[1:46:34] You're not trying to find out what Joe
[1:46:37] Blow is naming his child down there in
[1:46:39] Egypt.
[1:46:42] You want to know the mind of the Lord.
[1:46:44] Somebody said, "I don't think God
[1:46:45] cares." I don't think you know what
[1:46:47] you're talking about.
[1:46:48] He does care.
[1:46:50] God had already named John before he was
[1:46:53] born.
[1:46:55] Then when the Holy Spirit, the angel of
[1:46:57] God, Gabriel, goes down in the city of
[1:46:59] Nazareth to a little Mary, he a wi a
[1:47:01] widowerower. He here she is with the
[1:47:05] oriental type probably with a water on
[1:47:08] her head, a water pot, packing it up to
[1:47:10] the washing, walking along the street.
[1:47:13] All at once a light flashes before her.
[1:47:15] She stopped. This is strange. Then
[1:47:18] something begins
[1:47:20] to materialize
[1:47:22] in that light. She looks standing there
[1:47:24] and there stood the great archangel
[1:47:26] said, "Hail Mary, it frightened the
[1:47:28] little virgin. Blessed art thou among
[1:47:30] women." She was frightened. It
[1:47:32] frightened you. It frightened me. There
[1:47:34] he was. Said, "You're going to have a
[1:47:36] baby knowing no man." She didn't argue
[1:47:38] about it. She said, uh, said, "The Holy
[1:47:40] Ghost is coming unto you and will
[1:47:42] overshadow you, and the holy thing will
[1:47:45] be called the Son of God." Stay with me.
[1:47:48] She said, "Behold the handmade of the
[1:47:50] Lord. Be it unto me according to the
[1:47:53] word."
[1:47:54] I want you to look at the yellow
[1:47:55] writing. Instead of arguing
[1:47:59] and questioning
[1:48:01] and going along like Zachcharias,
[1:48:06] I want you to see the contrast.
[1:48:08] Zachchariah was a priest in the holy
[1:48:12] temple, chosen from before his birth to
[1:48:15] serve the Lord. He knew the law. He
[1:48:19] dedicated his life to knowing the truth
[1:48:22] of God. He had become so religious and
[1:48:26] so starchy that he couldn't even believe
[1:48:29] that God was going to answer his prayer.
[1:48:33] He chose rather to look at his
[1:48:35] circumstances
[1:48:38] than to believe an angel who had come
[1:48:41] from the presence of the Lord.
[1:48:44] And then you've got a little maiden, a
[1:48:46] little virgin, a little teenage girl
[1:48:51] living with mom and daddy.
[1:48:54] not not religious.
[1:48:56] She didn't know the whole law. She only
[1:48:59] knew what had been taught her. Some of
[1:49:01] the extra biblical books suppose I'm not
[1:49:05] against it. I'm not I'm not introducing
[1:49:07] this as truth, but I'm just telling you
[1:49:09] it it's it certainly could be a a
[1:49:11] reality. Uh some of those extra biblical
[1:49:14] books written at that time suggest that
[1:49:17] she was one of of of a of a group of
[1:49:21] young maidens who were chosen. They were
[1:49:24] daughters of priests and uh or or
[1:49:27] daughters of of uh just and devout men.
[1:49:32] and their job was to make sure that the
[1:49:37] veil of the temple was uh always in good
[1:49:42] repair.
[1:49:43] Now, I don't know whether that's true or
[1:49:45] not, but it makes an interesting
[1:49:47] thought. She was not learned. She was
[1:49:50] not a scholar. She was just a humble
[1:49:53] little teenage girl. And God shows up
[1:49:56] and what he said to her through the
[1:49:58] angel was about to rock her world
[1:50:00] because her little her little place in
[1:50:03] the community as a daughter of a devout
[1:50:06] man and a righteous family was about to
[1:50:09] forever be shattered
[1:50:11] because the news was going to be spread
[1:50:14] in the matter of seconds.
[1:50:16] They had no telephones
[1:50:19] and they had no texting. Right.
[1:50:22] But how many of you know how that goes?
[1:50:25] You can telegraph.
[1:50:28] You can telephone
[1:50:32] or you can tell a woman.
[1:50:35] No offense
[1:50:37] cuz some men are pretty good at
[1:50:38] spreading stuff too. Especially some
[1:50:40] around here.
[1:50:42] Let me hear your amen.
[1:50:45] But they got the word around. You know
[1:50:47] that little mirror? You know that little
[1:50:49] Miriam? She presents herself to be so
[1:50:52] holy.
[1:50:54] Well, she may think that I haven't
[1:50:56] noticed her belly swelling, but I know
[1:50:59] that something has go. I never did trust
[1:51:02] that Joseph.
[1:51:04] He He's a sketchy sort of fella. Come on
[1:51:07] now.
[1:51:08] What the Lord had said to her through
[1:51:10] Gabriel was going to rock her world. It
[1:51:13] was going to change her standing in the
[1:51:15] community. She was never going to be
[1:51:17] looked at as the same. She wasn't going
[1:51:19] to be able to draw her water when
[1:51:21] everybody else was drawing their water
[1:51:24] like the woman at the well. She was
[1:51:26] going to be looked at and ridiculed. She
[1:51:28] was going to walk down the street and
[1:51:30] the neighbors were going to say, "There
[1:51:32] she is.
[1:51:38] I'm going to see how far I can get away
[1:51:39] from the pull pit."
[1:51:42] I knew I knew there was something loose
[1:51:44] about her.
[1:51:47] In today's society, she'd be called a
[1:51:49] hoe.
[1:51:52] And she was just as holy,
[1:51:55] just as clean, just as pure. In that
[1:51:59] moment that the angel showed up to her
[1:52:01] and said, "I'm going to perform a
[1:52:02] miracle in your life, and I'm going to
[1:52:04] give you a babe, overshadow you by the
[1:52:06] Holy Ghost, and that baby is going to be
[1:52:08] the son of God." In that moment, she
[1:52:10] didn't think about how it was going to
[1:52:12] rock her world. She didn't even think
[1:52:14] about what Joseph
[1:52:17] was going to think.
[1:52:19] He knew that he hadn't touched her.
[1:52:23] She She couldn't be concerned about that
[1:52:25] in that moment. She was receiving a
[1:52:28] divine promise from the Lord.
[1:52:32] And all she could do was say, "How can
[1:52:36] this be?" And when God gave her the
[1:52:38] answer, it was enough.
[1:52:41] No more reasoning, no more trying to
[1:52:44] figure it out,
[1:52:46] her response was an eternal amen. She
[1:52:49] said, "Be it unto me
[1:52:54] no matter what it cost me."
[1:52:58] Are you here
[1:53:00] according to thy word?
[1:53:03] Brother Brandham goes on.
[1:53:06] She just took God at his word.
[1:53:10] She didn't question and argue like
[1:53:13] Zachcharias.
[1:53:14] God give Zion tonight. Listen, some
[1:53:18] Marys.
[1:53:20] Oh God, give New Hope Church tonight.
[1:53:23] today some some Maryies
[1:53:26] men or women who will be like Mary and
[1:53:30] say, "I'm not going to argue with you,
[1:53:32] Lord. I don't know how you're going to
[1:53:35] do what you said, but I know you're not
[1:53:38] a God who lies. I'm going to take you at
[1:53:42] your word."
[1:53:45] Let's go on.
[1:53:46] She went out testifying.
[1:53:48] Uhoh.
[1:53:52] Now, isn't that the biblical order?
[1:53:55] You believe. Yes, sir.
[1:53:57] You you you
[1:54:00] accept it. You believe it. And you
[1:54:02] testify. You confess it. Yes, sir.
[1:54:04] She began to tell people, "I'm going to
[1:54:06] have a baby knowing no man." Oh my.
[1:54:09] Before she had any physical evidence at
[1:54:12] all,
[1:54:14] what did she have? God's word.
[1:54:17] I ask you again, what did she have?
[1:54:19] God's word. What do you have?
[1:54:22] Had they promised you something?
[1:54:26] She went out testifying.
[1:54:29] That's all that she needed. She went out
[1:54:32] and said, "I'm having a baby."
[1:54:35] The question came, "Have you felt life?"
[1:54:37] "No, sir." "Are you positive?" "I'm
[1:54:40] positive." "Well, if you haven't felt
[1:54:42] life, there's nothing. How do you know
[1:54:45] you're going to have it?"
[1:54:48] Nobody would have liked to have been
[1:54:50] married.
[1:54:51] God said so. Look at that rest of the
[1:54:54] thing there.
[1:54:56] So, you know that little slogan we say,
[1:54:58] "God said it. I believe it. That settles
[1:55:00] it." You can just leave your believing
[1:55:02] out.
[1:55:03] Because if God said it, that settles it.
[1:55:05] Your belief is only going to determine
[1:55:08] whether or not you receive your portion
[1:55:10] of the promise.
[1:55:12] Brother Vanam said, "God said so. That
[1:55:14] settles it." That was Mary's attitude.
[1:55:16] Are you going to get well? Yes, sir.
[1:55:18] Have you got any evidence? Yes, sir.
[1:55:20] What is it? God said so. That's right.
[1:55:22] It's good enough for me. I'm going to
[1:55:24] ask you this morning. Are you going to
[1:55:25] get well?
[1:55:28] H Have you got any evidence that you're
[1:55:30] going to get well?
[1:55:32] Are you going to get through that
[1:55:33] problem that you're going through right
[1:55:34] now? Have you got any evidence that
[1:55:36] you're going to
[1:55:38] Are you going to get out from under
[1:55:39] depression?
[1:55:41] Are you going to trust God to help you
[1:55:42] off of those anxiety drugs? Yeah.
[1:55:45] Are you going to put God to the test and
[1:55:47] believe him? Do you have any evidence?
[1:55:50] Then what is it?
[1:55:52] Help me. Help me. Help me. Help
[1:55:55] yourself.
[1:55:56] God said so.
[1:56:00] God said so. Do you hear that, devil?
[1:56:04] God said so.
[1:56:10] He said, "I'm going to give you your
[1:56:11] children,
[1:56:13] and your children are going to serve
[1:56:16] me."
[1:56:19] Do you have any evidence that they're
[1:56:21] turning toward the Lord now?
[1:56:25] Not with the natural eye.
[1:56:28] In fact, the natural eye is they get
[1:56:30] meaner every day.
[1:56:34] Somebody said, "I hear from them less
[1:56:36] and less." You know why? They're more
[1:56:39] and more miserable.
[1:56:41] And you know what your prayer ought to
[1:56:42] be? Instead of you asking us to pray
[1:56:44] them out of every problem they get into,
[1:56:48] get them out of every tough situation.
[1:56:52] Bail them out of every issue that they
[1:56:53] have.
[1:56:55] Oh, it got quiet then, didn't it?
[1:56:59] God gave you a promise.
[1:57:01] You got to trust God.
[1:57:03] You got to believe that God knows how to
[1:57:05] get their attention. Sometimes he does
[1:57:08] it with a little squeezing.
[1:57:10] Sometimes he has to ring them out a
[1:57:11] little bit to get their attention. Do
[1:57:13] you want us to pray that they'll quit
[1:57:15] being rung out?
[1:57:17] Or do you want us to agree with you that
[1:57:20] God has given you a promise for your
[1:57:22] lost loved ones?
[1:57:25] Now that's rubber meet the road.
[1:57:28] That's just rubber meet the road. No.
[1:57:30] No. I'm not going to pray to get them
[1:57:32] out of jail.
[1:57:37] I'm going to tell you something else.
[1:57:39] I'm not going to postpone for them
[1:57:40] anymore.
[1:57:42] I've done that.
[1:57:44] That ship has sailed.
[1:57:46] If they're there, they may be exactly
[1:57:49] where God wants them to be.
[1:57:53] We almost had two young men from our
[1:57:54] church hauled to the to the uh to the
[1:57:57] what do you call them?
[1:58:00] You know what's some pokey? Is that what
[1:58:03] they used to say? We almost had two
[1:58:05] young men on a golf cart around here uh
[1:58:08] hauled to the pokey last night
[1:58:11] and one of them said to the other, "What
[1:58:13] would we have done if they'd have to and
[1:58:16] and we had to call your dad?"
[1:58:19] "Well, according to what I'm preaching
[1:58:21] today, I might have had to tell you.
[1:58:28] Maybe that's where you're supposed to
[1:58:29] be. Maybe you're supposed to preach to
[1:58:32] those that are in there.
[1:58:34] If you're there, it's not just you
[1:58:37] didn't do anything to be locked up, but
[1:58:38] if you're there, there may be a reason
[1:58:40] for it. Do you at least get my point?
[1:58:46] God, heal them.
[1:58:50] God, take care of them.
[1:58:53] God, do this and do that and Lord, help
[1:58:55] pay their bills and give them a better
[1:58:57] job and all the kinds of prayers that
[1:59:00] well-meaning parents
[1:59:03] want the man of God to pray.
[1:59:05] Well, I want you to know that what you
[1:59:07] need to do at times like that is take
[1:59:10] your hands off.
[1:59:13] God's given you a promise.
[1:59:19] Do you have any evidence? Put that back
[1:59:21] up for me, would you? Do you have any
[1:59:23] evidence? Yes.
[1:59:25] What is your evidence? God
[1:59:30] God said so.
[1:59:33] It's good enough for me.
[1:59:35] Is it good enough for you?
[1:59:37] Are you going to let God have his You're
[1:59:39] not down praying God break every bone in
[1:59:41] their body. Don't dare pray such a
[1:59:43] foolish prayer as that.
[1:59:46] Don't pray that they'll that they will
[1:59:48] know suffering and heartache and and
[1:59:51] humility and and be humiliated. Don't
[1:59:54] don't pray such a prayer as that. But
[1:59:56] don't always pray them out of every
[1:59:58] situation they find themselves in. Trust
[2:00:01] God. Believe that he has given you a
[2:00:04] promise.
[2:00:06] Oh, that went over like a lead balloon.
[2:00:10] You'd think I was serving somebody a rat
[2:00:12] sandwich this morning. They don't want
[2:00:13] none of that. Have you got any evidence?
[2:00:17] I do. What is it? God said so. That's
[2:00:20] right. It's good enough for me. In the
[2:00:23] message, believest thou this, he said,
[2:00:25] now to you people here in a wheelchair.
[2:00:28] If those people here last night walk
[2:00:30] from a wheelchair, if this man from a
[2:00:32] crippled bed and so forth for all those
[2:00:35] years, it's so in your case. Amen. All
[2:00:39] right. Notice there he was. He went home
[2:00:42] after the days his wife conceived and at
[2:00:45] the point she was about six months along
[2:00:48] something like that. Then God sent
[2:00:49] Gabriel back again. Amen. Here he come.
[2:00:52] I see a little old girl living down in
[2:00:55] Nazareth. A poor humble family. Her name
[2:00:58] Mary about 18 years old engaged to a man
[2:01:01] that had been married before a
[2:01:03] widowerower had some children. And here
[2:01:06] they come along. She's walking. Maybe
[2:01:08] it's wash day. She's got water on her
[2:01:11] head, an oriental type of packing water
[2:01:13] from a well. All at once, a big bright
[2:01:15] light flashed before her. There in a
[2:01:17] bright light stood Gabriel, the angel of
[2:01:20] God said, "Hail Mary, blessed art thou
[2:01:22] among women. You found favor with God.
[2:01:24] You're going to have a child knowing no
[2:01:26] man, and he'll be called the son of
[2:01:28] God." That's a good summary. He said,
[2:01:30] "Look, the priest doubted Gabriel's
[2:01:35] word."
[2:01:37] Doubt will get you in trouble. Right?
[2:01:40] Saying the wrong thing will get you in
[2:01:41] trouble. Asking the wrong question can
[2:01:44] get you in trouble. This is believing.
[2:01:47] But Mary, I want somebody to say, just
[2:01:50] play along with me. But Mary, I want you
[2:01:53] to say, "But Mary,
[2:01:54] but Mary,"
[2:01:55] this religious priest
[2:01:58] who knew the exploits of God, and yet
[2:02:02] when it come to a personal promise, he
[2:02:05] wasn't sure how God was going to sort
[2:02:07] that out. Wow.
[2:02:09] But Mary,
[2:02:11] Zachcharias had nothing to lose except
[2:02:14] the the shadow that had been over his
[2:02:17] wife for being barren in that culture.
[2:02:20] That's all he had to lose. He had
[2:02:22] nothing else to lose. If God said it,
[2:02:24] why wouldn't you just grab a hold of it
[2:02:25] and believe it? All you've got to lose
[2:02:27] is a little shadow of reproach that's
[2:02:29] been on your family. Mary had everything
[2:02:31] to lose.
[2:02:33] She could have lost her engaged husband,
[2:02:35] espoused husband. She certainly lost
[2:02:37] some of her friends, perhaps some of her
[2:02:39] family, but Mary and he had something to
[2:02:42] believe that happened before that time.
[2:02:44] Everything that God wanted to do for
[2:02:47] Zacharias and Elizabeth, he had done
[2:02:49] before. There was a Bible precedent.
[2:02:52] God did it for Abraham and Sarah, God
[2:02:54] did it for Hannah. Hello.
[2:02:57] But Mary didn't have nothing,
[2:03:00] right?
[2:03:01] Because never a baby had been born
[2:03:04] without being well, you know, like a man
[2:03:07] and wife.
[2:03:08] But she was going to have a baby by the
[2:03:11] Holy Spirit. Can you imagine
[2:03:14] her trying to explain that?
[2:03:20] No wonder the songwriter said from
[2:03:23] scripture, who who could believe such a
[2:03:25] thing?
[2:03:27] How could this be poss? And instead of
[2:03:29] doubting him, what did she say? Behold,
[2:03:34] I need your help.
[2:03:36] Somebody's teetering back and forth
[2:03:39] today about whether or not to grab a
[2:03:41] hold of a promise that's been made to
[2:03:42] them. Let's see if we can push them over
[2:03:44] the edge in the right direction.
[2:03:46] Let's pull on the word just a moment or
[2:03:48] two before we go. Be it unto me
[2:03:50] according to thy word. Hallelujah. Oh,
[2:03:52] that's what we need is some more Marys.
[2:03:56] God's looking for a people that will
[2:03:59] take God at his word.
[2:04:04] Mary said, "Behold the handmade
[2:04:07] of the Lord."
[2:04:10] What uh what paragraph is that? Did I
[2:04:13] get lost?
[2:04:16] But she was going to have a baby by the
[2:04:19] Holy Spirit. And instead of doubting
[2:04:21] him, that's right. What we need is some
[2:04:23] more marriage. Take God at his word. Now
[2:04:25] go on. She didn't wait till she felt
[2:04:27] life.
[2:04:33] She didn't wait till the baby kicked.
[2:04:37] She didn't wait till she had
[2:04:38] indigestion.
[2:04:40] She didn't wait on a back cramp.
[2:04:43] She began testifying.
[2:04:47] This wasn't something that had happened
[2:04:49] before.
[2:04:50] She was getting some strange
[2:04:54] looks.
[2:04:54] Yeah,
[2:04:58] I've heard some strange things.
[2:05:01] But she believed
[2:05:04] and she started testifying, I'm going to
[2:05:06] have a baby. And as soon as she wasn't
[2:05:09] even married, she was only a spouse.
[2:05:12] They hadn't actually
[2:05:14] had their vows.
[2:05:17] There had been no intimacy.
[2:05:19] They were only espoused. And she's
[2:05:22] already telling people,
[2:05:24] "I'm going to have a baby."
[2:05:27] Poor girl.
[2:05:29] She's off her rocker.
[2:05:32] I always knew she was weird.
[2:05:35] I knew she was strange. Odd. That girl
[2:05:38] has been odd. Her great aunt. That girl
[2:05:42] has been odd since she was born. She's
[2:05:46] always had the wildest imagination of
[2:05:49] any child in the family. You can never
[2:05:52] you can't even guess what she's going to
[2:05:54] come up with next. But she began to
[2:05:57] testify, "I'm going to have a baby."
[2:06:00] He said, "Hallelujah. As soon as God's
[2:06:03] word
[2:06:07] sinks in your heart,
[2:06:10] get up.
[2:06:12] Yes, sir.
[2:06:15] And give a testimony.
[2:06:17] And like I said last night, it don't
[2:06:18] have to be drawn out and you don't have
[2:06:20] to tell every detail and put every piece
[2:06:23] of the puzzle together for the one
[2:06:24] you're testifying to. You can do it with
[2:06:27] faith in a rather short amount of time.
[2:06:29] God said it. I believe it. It's done.
[2:06:33] Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[2:06:34] If somebody comes asking, you can give
[2:06:36] them all the details they've got time to
[2:06:38] hear. He's not talking about demanding
[2:06:41] everyone's attention to tell your story.
[2:06:44] He's talking about giving a witness
[2:06:47] immediately that God has made a promise
[2:06:50] and I'm going to hold on to that
[2:06:52] promise.
[2:06:54] Zachcharias wasn't sure. Mary was sure.
[2:06:58] She didn't wait. Let's go on.
[2:07:02] That's it.
[2:07:04] When God takes the Holy Spirit and
[2:07:06] brings that word to you and makes it
[2:07:08] alive to you, a reality that your faith
[2:07:11] stand up and claim it.
[2:07:15] I want you to look at your neighbor. I I
[2:07:16] I don't feel you enough. I hear you, but
[2:07:19] I don't feel you enough. I want you to
[2:07:21] look at your neighbor and and I want you
[2:07:23] to to repeat that to them. I want you to
[2:07:26] say when that sinks in when when when
[2:07:29] that reality stand up and claim it. Look
[2:07:31] at your neighbor. Stand up and claim it.
[2:07:43] You all don't do what you're told, do
[2:07:44] you?
[2:07:48] I thought if someone turned to their
[2:07:50] neighbor and said, "Stand up and claim
[2:07:51] it."
[2:07:53] I thought maybe somebody would stand up
[2:07:55] and claim it. There you go. There you
[2:07:58] go. There you go. Somebody say, "This is
[2:08:00] crazy." I don't care what you say.
[2:08:02] Stand up and claim it.
[2:08:04] It's mine.
[2:08:07] Your word said,
[2:08:12] "It's mine. I'm going to have my
[2:08:15] promise.
[2:08:16] It's mine. I'm not going to spend my
[2:08:19] time questioning God. I'm going to stand
[2:08:22] up and claim it.
[2:08:25] Hallelujah.
[2:08:27] [Applause]
[2:08:31] Well, I'm waiting to feel better. Don't
[2:08:35] Don't Don't wait to feel better.
[2:08:37] A many a person has given their miracle
[2:08:39] away. Yes, sir.
[2:08:41] Because before they got to the car, they
[2:08:43] said to somebody on the way out, "I
[2:08:45] don't feel any different."
[2:08:48] Now, you ought to be able to tell your
[2:08:49] companion everything,
[2:08:51] but you ought to be careful what you
[2:08:53] tell them.
[2:08:55] You're you're driving home at night and
[2:08:56] and your wife's been prayed for and the
[2:08:58] husband turns and he said, "Honey, do do
[2:09:00] you feel any different?"
[2:09:05] First of all, that's not even a biblical
[2:09:07] believing question.
[2:09:08] That's right.
[2:09:09] Because it's not how you feel.
[2:09:11] Did God touch you tonight? Did God help
[2:09:13] you tonight? Did God strengthen you
[2:09:15] tonight? Did he meet you there tonight?
[2:09:18] That's a good question. Then the wife
[2:09:20] can say instead of saying, "Yeah, I
[2:09:22] mean, I went up. They called me up, but
[2:09:24] I don't feel any different." In that
[2:09:25] moment, she can say, "Yes, I'm claiming
[2:09:28] that my healing is a done deal. I'm
[2:09:30] claiming that my promise is secure."
[2:09:34] You may think that sounds like crazy
[2:09:36] talk, but I want you to know sometimes
[2:09:38] God's talk is crazy.
[2:09:40] It's crazy talk.
[2:09:43] We know he's Jehovah Rafa and we know
[2:09:45] he's Jehovah Sikanu and we know he's
[2:09:48] Jehovah Ni. We know all of these things.
[2:09:51] But sometimes we fail to remember that
[2:09:54] he's Jehovah sneaky.
[2:09:56] [Applause]
[2:09:58] And he sneaks up sometimes on us because
[2:10:02] he wants to bless us.
[2:10:04] And before we get the blessing, we talk
[2:10:07] ourselves right out of the faith.
[2:10:09] Well, I didn't feel any better.
[2:10:12] didn't even feel a tingle.
[2:10:16] It's quiet in here,
[2:10:18] but it is true. And thank you for saying
[2:10:20] so. It is true.
[2:10:22] Hallelujah.
[2:10:23] When God takes the Holy Spirit and
[2:10:25] brings that Amen.
[2:10:28] Stand up and claim. You don't have to
[2:10:30] feel nothing, see nothing,
[2:10:33] he said, or nothing. You don't have to
[2:10:36] smell anything.
[2:10:38] You don't have to feel any kind of
[2:10:39] tingle.
[2:10:43] Let
[2:10:43] let me be real real for somebody.
[2:10:46] You may still hurt.
[2:10:50] If you're waiting not to hurt to thank
[2:10:52] God for healing you,
[2:10:56] you're missing your blessing.
[2:10:59] Don't lie.
[2:11:01] You can speak faith without telling a
[2:11:03] lie.
[2:11:05] You can say, "I'm claiming the promise."
[2:11:08] If somebody says, "Well, how are you
[2:11:09] feeling? Are you feeling it better?" I'm
[2:11:10] claiming the promise. Don't lie.
[2:11:14] You don't have to say, "I feel great."
[2:11:16] No pain. If you've got pain, but you can
[2:11:20] say, "I'm I'm claiming the promise. I'm
[2:11:22] healed. I'm healed.
[2:11:24] I'm healed."
[2:11:25] Yes, sir.
[2:11:26] Don't wait on there to be an absence of
[2:11:28] pain. Don't wait for something to be
[2:11:30] changed. Don't wait till you see it or
[2:11:32] hear it or smell it.
[2:11:35] Brother Brandham gets quite carried away
[2:11:37] in this. He said, "You don't have to
[2:11:38] feel nothing, see nothing, or nothing.
[2:11:40] You have to believe something." And he
[2:11:42] screams, "Amen."
[2:11:45] And then he says, "I'm not amening
[2:11:47] myself,
[2:11:49] but it means so be it.
[2:11:52] I'm amening the reality of what the Lord
[2:11:54] has spoken over my life." Amen. Is there
[2:11:57] more in that one?
[2:11:59] Then go to the next one.
[2:12:05] Are you still here? Yes,
[2:12:08] this one is I am the resurrection and
[2:12:10] the life. Now look at the difference
[2:12:11] between Zachcharias, that minister, that
[2:12:14] priest who had studied the scriptures
[2:12:16] over and over and over and over and over
[2:12:18] and over again had plenty of examples.
[2:12:20] Sarah, Hannah, and so forth back in the
[2:12:22] Old Testament, plenty of examples. God
[2:12:25] wasn't even stretching his imagination.
[2:12:28] God was just promising him what he'd
[2:12:30] already done,
[2:12:32] but he doubted it. So,
[2:12:34] but this little girl didn't doubt. She
[2:12:36] said, "Behold, the handmade of the Lord,
[2:12:38] be it unto me according to thy word."
[2:12:39] Brother Brandham says, "What a
[2:12:43] difference."
[2:12:44] I'm asking you, I'm laying this on you
[2:12:47] today.
[2:12:49] Is there going to be a great difference
[2:12:50] in you? Who are you going to relate to?
[2:12:54] Are you going to relate to Zachcharias
[2:12:56] who refuses to to look at the examples
[2:12:59] that God's already done that and it's
[2:13:01] easy for him to do it again? Are you
[2:13:03] going to have to have it proven to you?
[2:13:05] Is God gonna have to strike you dumb?
[2:13:09] Dumber.
[2:13:14] No offense.
[2:13:17] You're supposed to say none taken.
[2:13:20] Oh, some of you did get a little
[2:13:21] offended. It's God going to have I'm
[2:13:24] going say it again then. Is God going to
[2:13:25] have to strike you dumber
[2:13:28] to keep you from speaking against
[2:13:31] what he has promised?
[2:13:34] He can.
[2:13:35] Yes, he can.
[2:13:36] Now, this is this is this is the
[2:13:38] quotation that stirred all this
[2:13:40] inspiration.
[2:13:42] I I was listening to this. He said,
[2:13:44] "Now, sometimes you can you you better
[2:13:48] hear this. I know I'm wearing on your
[2:13:50] nerves,
[2:13:53] but you got to hear this. I hope I
[2:13:54] hadn't wore you out so that you can't
[2:13:56] hear this."
[2:13:57] He said, "Now, sometimes you can callous
[2:14:00] yourself." Now, now somebody tell me
[2:14:03] what a callous is.
[2:14:06] It's a hard place of skin that starts
[2:14:10] hardening guitar. You just ask a guitar
[2:14:12] player
[2:14:13] what a callous is.
[2:14:16] Just ask a a a hardworking man who works
[2:14:19] with his hands what a callous is.
[2:14:22] You can get them on your hands. You can
[2:14:24] get them on your feet. just a heart. And
[2:14:26] I want you to know there there is a
[2:14:28] callus that gets so bad it can hurt
[2:14:31] underneath that thing and split and you
[2:14:35] can have all kinds of problems. So you
[2:14:37] all know what a callous is. It's a place
[2:14:39] that's getting w worn.
[2:14:42] It's getting worn and it gets hard.
[2:14:45] It really changes the nature of the
[2:14:47] skin. Now sometimes you can callous
[2:14:51] yourself
[2:14:53] reading the Bible
[2:14:56] like reading a newspaper.
[2:15:04] I'mma wait on that one.
[2:15:07] And having about the same kind of faith
[2:15:10] that you would have in one newspaper.
[2:15:14] Anybody remember what a newspaper is?
[2:15:18] Then you callous yourself.
[2:15:24] You have to become almost numb
[2:15:27] to the bad news.
[2:15:30] Because the world is full of it.
[2:15:32] Our nation is full of it.
[2:15:35] You can really become indifferent to
[2:15:37] people's suffering.
[2:15:39] Sitting right there watching the news
[2:15:42] about how people are suffering in the
[2:15:44] world.
[2:15:46] You can begin to read the Bible like you
[2:15:49] would a newspaper,
[2:15:51] trying to find out who was in the car
[2:15:53] wreck. Were they okay?
[2:15:56] You can take God's word and start
[2:15:58] reading it and and and getting so
[2:16:01] callous that nothing is quickened in
[2:16:03] you. That's my promise.
[2:16:06] I'm reading my story.
[2:16:08] God's word is saying that to me.
[2:16:11] How many of you believe it takes a
[2:16:12] personal revelation? God taking that
[2:16:15] word and quickening it to you.
[2:16:18] He said when you read God's word,
[2:16:22] hello.
[2:16:24] Believe it.
[2:16:26] It's just like it says it is there and
[2:16:32] now. Now, as soon as she as soon as she
[2:16:34] read this or or seen this before her and
[2:16:37] the angel of the Lord said, "You're
[2:16:39] going to have a baby.
[2:16:41] Look what she had to believe. She had to
[2:16:44] believe something that had never
[2:16:45] happened. Zachcharias didn't have to.
[2:16:50] Plenty times did that happen through the
[2:16:52] scripture. Plenty of examples. But Mary
[2:16:54] had to believe something that was total
[2:16:57] impossible
[2:16:59] and had never happened before.
[2:17:01] Now, now let me ask you about your
[2:17:02] problems
[2:17:04] now, brother.
[2:17:08] Has God ever healed you personally of
[2:17:10] anything in your life? Have you ever had
[2:17:13] a healing? You knew God had touched you.
[2:17:16] Let me see your hand. Yes, sir.
[2:17:20] Is that a lot of us? That's that's about
[2:17:22] the majority of us. And sometimes it's
[2:17:25] hard to know because we've run for the
[2:17:27] for the Advil and the Alie and come on
[2:17:30] and the Tylenol. And it's hard to know
[2:17:32] sometime what's helping us. Is it prayer
[2:17:34] or is it a pill?
[2:17:37] Hello.
[2:17:38] I'm not against that. I'm just telling
[2:17:40] you that that may be why some can't
[2:17:42] raise their hand. I I would like to tell
[2:17:44] you that God has healed you and
[2:17:47] sometimes so profoundly that he was
[2:17:50] sparing your life
[2:17:52] and you didn't always realize that.
[2:17:54] One more time, let me see the hand of
[2:17:56] every person who'd say you've seen God
[2:17:58] heal. Well, let me ask you this. How
[2:17:59] many of you have ever known anybody that
[2:18:02] that had a healing and you had
[2:18:03] confidence in that? you believe that God
[2:18:05] healed them.
[2:18:07] I'm talking to brother Garvis on the
[2:18:09] phone the other night and and uh you
[2:18:12] know he's been given this he's been
[2:18:14] given this mandate and he's going to
[2:18:17] take 24 to 48 hours to make a decision.
[2:18:22] And so I said, "Well, how does that you
[2:18:24] know what does that look like?" He said,
[2:18:25] "Well, I can either I can either go on
[2:18:28] the dialysis or or
[2:18:34] and I kept waiting on the ore."
[2:18:36] And the ore was unseen. It was unspoken
[2:18:41] because we both knew the reality.
[2:18:44] Without a miracle, he was going to die.
[2:18:48] And I said, "Brother, you want to live.
[2:18:51] You want to live for your family. Yes.
[2:18:54] You want to live to serve the Lord.
[2:18:56] So, you have no decision.
[2:18:58] That's right.
[2:18:59] It don't take 24 to 48 hours. You've got
[2:19:02] to choose to live.
[2:19:04] And I said, "But brother, you know,
[2:19:08] say with me, you know that God is a
[2:19:11] healer." Amen.
[2:19:12] He said, "Brother Shelly, if anybody
[2:19:15] knows
[2:19:16] [Music]
[2:19:19] that God is a healer, I know he's a
[2:19:23] healer."
[2:19:26] He saw what God can do. Yeah,
[2:19:32] little Casey Hannah, four years old
[2:19:36] with leukemia
[2:19:39] that so defeated her immune system that
[2:19:43] she caught a fungus that's present
[2:19:47] around us every day of our lives.
[2:19:51] But our immune system suppresses and
[2:19:54] kicks that off. Her immune system
[2:19:57] couldn't handle it. And that fungus
[2:19:59] began to grow in her body.
[2:20:03] You know it.
[2:20:04] Until it attached itself to the bone
[2:20:09] and began to eat the bone of the brain
[2:20:14] plate,
[2:20:15] the the skeletal plate that holds the
[2:20:19] brain.
[2:20:22] I was present when she blew her nose
[2:20:28] and bone fragments
[2:20:30] came out her nose
[2:20:33] because the fungus was destroying
[2:20:37] not only the optic nerve that's left her
[2:20:41] with no sight in that eye, but was
[2:20:45] destroying the plate that the brain sat
[2:20:48] on. And the doctors knew nothing to do
[2:20:51] for her.
[2:20:54] Now they will claim their their horse
[2:20:57] medicine.
[2:20:59] This what they used.
[2:21:01] They used livestock medicine to try to
[2:21:05] help her. But I want you to know they
[2:21:08] didn't even have a lot of hope in their
[2:21:09] own medication.
[2:21:11] And they told them so. I'm in Canada and
[2:21:15] I get a word from the Lord,
[2:21:19] a real promise from the Lord. And it was
[2:21:22] the hardest phone call I've ever had to
[2:21:24] make in my life. And I called Brother
[2:21:27] Garvis. And if I can remember correctly,
[2:21:30] he was either on the parking deck or had
[2:21:33] just come from the parking deck of the
[2:21:36] hospital where he had paced every
[2:21:38] morning crying out to God.
[2:21:41] I got to go back a minute.
[2:21:44] They couldn't have children.
[2:21:47] They lost a child.
[2:21:50] They had come to my uh anniversary. What
[2:21:53] What would it have been? My 20th
[2:21:55] anniversary.
[2:21:56] My 20th preaching anniversary. And had
[2:21:59] given me a a a card.
[2:22:04] They I had signed papers for them to be
[2:22:07] foster parents. and they were in the
[2:22:09] process of getting uh a foster child
[2:22:12] because they couldn't have any children
[2:22:13] of their own. To my anniversary, they
[2:22:15] bought me a card. And in the card, they
[2:22:18] wrote their good news.
[2:22:20] God has performed a miracle.
[2:22:23] What the doctor said would never happen
[2:22:25] has happened. And God gave them a child.
[2:22:29] And they named that child Casey Hannah.
[2:22:31] And they gave her back to the Lord. Now,
[2:22:34] four years later, something is trying to
[2:22:37] destroy her life.
[2:22:40] And the word of the Lord came, call
[2:22:43] Garvis and ask him if he is willing to
[2:22:47] give Casey back to him.
[2:22:51] And I said, Lord, how did you mean? What
[2:22:54] does that mean? How how serious is this?
[2:22:57] He said, "Like Abraham
[2:23:01] was willing to lay his promised son on
[2:23:04] the altar."
[2:23:06] You tell him, "If he's willing to do
[2:23:10] that, I will raise her up for my glory."
[2:23:17] That was a hard call to make. I was
[2:23:20] sobbing.
[2:23:22] And you know what his answer to me was?
[2:23:25] the most profound faithfilled answer
[2:23:27] that anybody could really give.
[2:23:30] I said, "Brother Garvis, are you willing
[2:23:32] to do that? Are you willing to give her
[2:23:34] up? Are you willing to lay her on the
[2:23:36] altar and say, "God, you gave her to me,
[2:23:38] and if it's your pleasure to take her,
[2:23:40] come and get her.
[2:23:44] I want you to think about your children,
[2:23:45] grandchildren, the ones you love so
[2:23:47] much. I don't even want to think about
[2:23:48] it."
[2:23:51] And you know what he said to me?
[2:23:54] You may think it sounds a little gruff.
[2:23:56] Well, he's not known for his congenial
[2:23:58] personality.
[2:24:01] I can't imagine where all that come
[2:24:03] from. But moving right along, he said,
[2:24:08] "Brother Shelly, what choice
[2:24:11] do I have?
[2:24:13] God gave her to me.
[2:24:16] What choice do I have but to give her
[2:24:20] back to God?"
[2:24:22] Hello. Amen.
[2:24:23] Hello.
[2:24:26] And I said, "You're absolutely right.
[2:24:28] We're going to believe God when you pray
[2:24:31] that prayer. You you go right back to
[2:24:33] where you've been pacing
[2:24:35] and you tell God exactly what we've
[2:24:38] discussed on this phone and you mean it
[2:24:42] with every fiber of your being. And if
[2:24:45] you'll do your part, I'm sure that God
[2:24:47] will do his part." Yes, sir.
[2:24:50] Her condition worsened.
[2:24:53] She could no longer eat.
[2:24:56] She was wasting away.
[2:24:59] Her body wasn't even responding to the
[2:25:02] medicine that was given to her. And her
[2:25:04] legs
[2:25:07] were bone
[2:25:09] and skin.
[2:25:11] The doctors said, "Whatever you do,
[2:25:13] don't bring her don't take her to that
[2:25:14] camp meeting." They explain the
[2:25:16] atmosphere, the sawdust on the ground,
[2:25:19] and you put a if, you know, if she were
[2:25:21] to be anywhere like put a mask on and so
[2:25:23] forth, etc. And you know, when people
[2:25:26] get to dancing down there, uh, in those
[2:25:28] days, it'd kick up the dust. And they
[2:25:30] were concerned about her. Of course,
[2:25:32] they were.
[2:25:34] But they brought her to a service that
[2:25:35] night. And if you'll remember, Brother
[2:25:37] Garvis carried her to the front to be
[2:25:40] prayed for. We hadn't even had her in a
[2:25:43] service in a terrible long amount of
[2:25:45] time and her little legs had shriveled.
[2:25:48] And we begin to pray. The saints begin
[2:25:50] to pray and we begin to claim the
[2:25:52] promise that God had given to brother
[2:25:54] Garvis. And God so miraculously touched
[2:25:58] her. How many of you were there? Let me
[2:26:00] see your hand.
[2:26:02] You see these hands. God so miraculously
[2:26:06] touched her and she hadn't eaten for
[2:26:08] days.
[2:26:12] He's so moved on her behalf and we were
[2:26:15] having a right here where the church
[2:26:17] sits. The tent was up and we were
[2:26:20] serving snacks and food after the
[2:26:22] service in a tent right here on this
[2:26:24] spot
[2:26:26] and they said to Casey Hannah, "Would
[2:26:29] you like something to eat?" And she had
[2:26:32] been refusing food and unable to eat
[2:26:35] food. Do you know what she said? I might
[2:26:37] take a hamburger.
[2:26:42] And she ate that hamburger and if I
[2:26:45] remember correctly started on another
[2:26:47] hamburger
[2:26:49] and of course those who knew she hadn't
[2:26:51] eaten anything, they knew a greasy
[2:26:53] hamburger wasn't what you give a child.
[2:26:59] But God so sustained her and
[2:27:02] strengthened her and she began to
[2:27:04] improve
[2:27:06] and God began to heal her. And her
[2:27:08] testimony is written up in a in a book
[2:27:12] about modern medical miracles.
[2:27:15] And that doesn't bother me at all
[2:27:17] because I know she's not a medical
[2:27:19] miracle.
[2:27:20] She's a Bible miracle.
[2:27:25] God wasn't asking Zachcharias to believe
[2:27:29] something that he hadn't already done.
[2:27:32] So, no wonder, Brother Garvey said to
[2:27:34] me, "If anybody believes that God can
[2:27:36] heal, I believe that God can heal." I
[2:27:38] want you, maybe it wasn't as
[2:27:40] extraordinary as that. But if you have
[2:27:43] ever been healed
[2:27:45] and you know that it wasn't the doctor's
[2:27:48] medicine that may have helped you to get
[2:27:50] to a place where you had to call on him,
[2:27:53] But you know that God moved for you. If
[2:27:56] that's ever happened to you, God is not
[2:27:58] asking you today to believe something
[2:27:59] that you don't know anything about. He's
[2:28:01] asking you to believe. If you've ever
[2:28:03] seen God touch a barren womb,
[2:28:05] [Music]
[2:28:08] I get to be connected on Facebook to
[2:28:11] people from conferences and conventions
[2:28:13] that I've preached around the world. And
[2:28:15] I get to see the former mayor
[2:28:17] quite often in in uh Red Deer,
[2:28:22] Alberta, Canada. I get to see him with
[2:28:25] his daughter and his son when the
[2:28:28] doctors had said they couldn't have
[2:28:29] children. And God gave us a word one
[2:28:32] night that they could have children. And
[2:28:33] I get to watch those kids grow up on
[2:28:35] Facebook knowing that God can do that.
[2:28:39] See, God's not asking you to believe
[2:28:43] something that you have no grid for
[2:28:45] believing.
[2:28:47] If you believe it, you've ever known a
[2:28:49] situation where God put a I tell you, he
[2:28:51] put Casey Hannah.
[2:28:53] God gave the her to them when they
[2:28:56] couldn't have any.
[2:28:58] God's not asking you to believe
[2:29:00] something that he's never done before.
[2:29:03] That was Mary.
[2:29:06] Zachcharias wasn't in that place. And
[2:29:08] yet he doubted. Put that quote up. Let's
[2:29:11] finish. I didn't mean to get into that.
[2:29:13] I got to stop now. Somebody will get me.
[2:29:17] You better be ready when you do. But
[2:29:20] Mary had to believe something was
[2:29:21] totally impossible and it never happened
[2:29:23] before. But yet she didn't stagger at
[2:29:24] it. She just said, "Behold the handmade
[2:29:27] of the Lord. Be it unto me." She did
[2:29:29] what?
[2:29:32] You believe that's a good thing to do?
[2:29:34] And today, right here now, while
[2:29:35] hundreds of people around the world have
[2:29:36] been healed in these grand campaigns, in
[2:29:39] this latter revival that's sweeping the
[2:29:41] world right today, right at the this
[2:29:43] minute, dozens and scores of people in
[2:29:45] meetings here in the United States are
[2:29:47] being healed right now by the power of
[2:29:48] God. That was the great sweeping healing
[2:29:50] revival.
[2:29:53] Brother Brandham certainly wasn't
[2:29:54] putting it on himself. He was saying all
[2:29:56] over the country, God's healing. It's a
[2:29:57] it's a healing revival. Plenty of
[2:29:59] examples every day, every night. And yet
[2:30:01] we sit and wonder. God, why don't you do
[2:30:04] this and why don't you do that? Here's
[2:30:06] the answer, folks. Read it for me, would
[2:30:08] you?
[2:30:11] Take God at his word. Mary said, "Behold
[2:30:14] the handmade of the Lord." She started
[2:30:16] rejoicing. She was happy. God had
[2:30:18] promised it. She knowed that she was
[2:30:21] going to have a baby.
[2:30:22] How about you musicians slipping this
[2:30:24] way and and sit?
[2:30:28] This will relax some of the people to
[2:30:31] see you moving
[2:30:33] closer.
[2:30:35] They'll know they're just a few minutes
[2:30:37] closer to me shutting up.
[2:30:43] God had promised it. She knowed she was
[2:30:45] going to have a baby. She didn't wait
[2:30:47] till she felt life. She didn't wait till
[2:30:50] she was positive. She didn't She didn't
[2:30:52] wait on a pregnancy test.
[2:30:55] She didn't wait on the doctor to tell
[2:30:56] her. She didn't wait on her blood work
[2:30:58] to come back. We know the hour where she
[2:31:00] was. She didn't wait till any visible
[2:31:02] sign. She just did what? She believed
[2:31:04] what the angel said was the truth. There
[2:31:06] you are. The trouble of it is
[2:31:12] The trouble of it is
[2:31:14] we question God.
[2:31:18] Well, isn't that reasonable? Yes, it's
[2:31:21] reasonable if we question God with the
[2:31:23] right attitude like Mary did. But not
[2:31:26] like Zachcharias did. What's my proof?
[2:31:29] He said, 'I got to see some proof before
[2:31:31] I can believe.
[2:31:33] Mary just said,"I don't know how this
[2:31:35] thing's going to be, but once he told
[2:31:36] her how it was going to be, you're going
[2:31:38] to be overshadowed by the Holy Ghost."
[2:31:39] She just said, "I believe that. I
[2:31:41] believe that. Be it unto me according to
[2:31:43] thy word." That's the biggest amen,
[2:31:45] wasn't it? Are you still here? You're
[2:31:47] you're you're kind of wiggling around
[2:31:48] like you're fixing to leave.
[2:31:56] Bar the door. Don't let him out. Just
[2:31:58] kidding.
[2:32:00] He said, "The trouble of it is we
[2:32:01] question God. And if we question God,
[2:32:06] we can't believe God." Faith, faith is
[2:32:10] the substance of things hoped for, the
[2:32:11] evidence of things you don't see, taste,
[2:32:13] feel, smell, or hear. Amen.
[2:32:16] Amen.
[2:32:17] I began to feel a little religious right
[2:32:18] now. All right. Oh, take God at his
[2:32:21] word. She began to rejoice and praise
[2:32:24] God just as soon as she heard. Faith
[2:32:27] cometh by hearing, hearing by the word
[2:32:28] of God. Is that right? Faith cometh by
[2:32:31] hearing. Soon as you hear the word of
[2:32:33] God that says you can be set free,
[2:32:36] it
[2:32:38] believe it. Rejoice with it.
[2:32:42] God will show you the evidence. Yes.
[2:32:46] After.
[2:32:50] That's the Bible order.
[2:32:52] But first you do what?
[2:32:55] You don't say, "Lord, I got to see
[2:32:56] proof. Lord, the only way this could
[2:32:58] happen is if you open the windows of
[2:33:00] heaven and poured out a blessing." And
[2:33:01] the prophet said, "All right,
[2:33:04] you'll see it with your eyes, but you
[2:33:05] won't be able to taste the abundance.
[2:33:08] God's going to deal with you. Christ
[2:33:10] died for sinners. I believe it. I accept
[2:33:12] it. I start rejoicing. God works
[2:33:14] righteousness by it. I believe he was
[2:33:16] striped for my healing. I believe it. I
[2:33:17] accept it. God's God's works healing for
[2:33:21] me. It's for me. It's for me.
[2:33:26] See,
[2:33:28] it's for me. Is that the end of that
[2:33:31] one? Just as soon as I believe. He can't
[2:33:33] help me till I believe. Whoop. What you
[2:33:37] mean I didn't yell that one?
[2:33:42] He can't help me
[2:33:44] till I believe. Pastor, I've prayed and
[2:33:46] I've prayed and I've prayed and I've not
[2:33:49] seen God move for my situation. Then I
[2:33:52] am I'm compelled to ask you a very
[2:33:55] uncomfortable question.
[2:33:58] Have you been reading the word of God
[2:33:59] like a newspaper?
[2:34:02] Have you become so callous to its
[2:34:03] promises that you can no longer see
[2:34:05] yourself in God's economy?
[2:34:09] The question is, do you believe it?
[2:34:12] Because he can't help you till you
[2:34:14] believe. Lord, I believe. Lord, I
[2:34:15] believe. He said, I've got to believe
[2:34:17] and confess it first and then Oh. Oh.
[2:34:20] Oh. Oh. Oh.
[2:34:24] Elas, read that out loud without the
[2:34:25] mic.
[2:34:29] God's under obligation.
[2:34:37] And if he's Almighty God, he can do all
[2:34:39] things. And if he cannot do all things,
[2:34:42] he's not Almighty God. Woo. That's
[2:34:44] getting close to the I mean, that's
[2:34:45] nitty-gritty, isn't it, sir?
[2:34:49] One more and we're closed.
[2:34:54] I don't know where Shawano, Wisconsin
[2:34:55] is, but
[2:34:57] Brother Brandham found it. He said, "But
[2:35:00] look at Mary. When the Holy Ghost told
[2:35:02] her, you're going to have a child
[2:35:03] knowing no man." And she didn't reason
[2:35:05] it. She just took him at his word. There
[2:35:07] you are. She went around testifying that
[2:35:09] she was going to have a baby knowing no
[2:35:10] man before she was positive of anything.
[2:35:13] Oh, I hope you see it. She took God at
[2:35:15] his word. She didn't wait. Excuse this
[2:35:18] imp excuse this expression. You'd listen
[2:35:21] to a doctor, but I'm your brother. She
[2:35:25] didn't wait till she felt life. She
[2:35:27] didn't wait till something taken place.
[2:35:29] She could see naturally that she was
[2:35:31] going to be a mother. She just took the
[2:35:33] angel's word. When the angel said,
[2:35:35] "You're going to have a baby knowing no
[2:35:37] man."
[2:35:38] She said, "Behold, the handmade of the
[2:35:40] Lord be unto me according to thy word."
[2:35:42] And she went around
[2:35:47] all downcast and forsaken. She went
[2:35:51] around rejoicing
[2:35:52] that she was going to have a baby before
[2:35:54] she had one evidence that the baby was
[2:35:56] coming outside the word of God. What
[2:35:59] evidence do you need outside the word of
[2:36:02] God? Oh, sister, do that tonight. You
[2:36:03] and you and all of you. Take God at his
[2:36:06] word and start rejoicing, saying, "God
[2:36:08] said so. That settles it. God said so,
[2:36:10] that settles it. God said so, that
[2:36:12] settles it. I will rejoice anyhow. I
[2:36:14] don't have to feel nothing or nothing
[2:36:16] else. I just believe it."
[2:36:21] Oh, and you'll see an oldfashioned
[2:36:23] revival sweep this country, burning out
[2:36:25] sin. Every church fill up. What a time
[2:36:27] it'll be if men and women will do that
[2:36:30] much. Take God at his word and be
[2:36:33] expecting him to do what he said he
[2:36:35] would do. You're the children of
[2:36:37] Abraham.
[2:36:39] That's only to the promise, folks. The
[2:36:43] promise is ours.
[2:36:46] Let's stand together.
[2:36:58] What was the difference
[2:37:00] between Zacharias and Mary?
[2:37:07] Zachcharias said the wrong thing.
[2:37:10] And God had to sew his lip shut
[2:37:12] so that he wouldn't talk himself out of
[2:37:14] the blessing. I I've said that more than
[2:37:17] once. I'm wondering if anybody has been
[2:37:20] able to recognize the possibility that
[2:37:23] somewhere in your life you talked
[2:37:27] yourself out of the blessing.
[2:37:32] I'm sure I've done it.
[2:37:35] But I know better this morning, this
[2:37:37] afternoon now. I know better.
[2:37:41] And I don't ever have to be guilty of
[2:37:42] talking myself out of it again.
[2:37:47] Brother Brandham said to brother Jimmy
[2:37:50] Gillette and also to uh the songwriter
[2:37:58] Barker, Fred Barker,
[2:38:00] one of these days
[2:38:02] you'll say the right word,
[2:38:05] you'll say the right thing and you'll
[2:38:08] come out of that wheelchair.
[2:38:13] Boy, I'd be trying to figure out
[2:38:16] what the right thing was.
[2:38:19] It'd be pretty discouraging as the years
[2:38:22] went by and they're still sitting in
[2:38:24] that wheelchair. It'd be pretty
[2:38:25] discouraging, wouldn't it? But I would
[2:38:28] be studying trying to find out what I
[2:38:31] was saying wrong and what I could say
[2:38:33] that would come into agreement with
[2:38:35] God's word. Your amen to the promise is
[2:38:39] vital for the fulfillment of that
[2:38:41] promise in your life. Lord, I believe.
[2:38:45] Would you tell him right now, Lord?
[2:38:48] [Music]
[2:38:50] With men, things are impossible,
[2:38:53] but nothing is impossible with you,
[2:38:57] Lord.
[2:38:58] Amen.
[2:38:58] I want you to just lift your faith to
[2:39:00] him right now. Lord, I believe.
[2:39:04] I want you to know your marriage is not
[2:39:06] hopeless.
[2:39:08] I want you to know God can work miracles
[2:39:10] in your life, in your relationship, if
[2:39:13] you'll let him do it. If you'll take him
[2:39:15] at his word, if you'll believe. Maybe
[2:39:18] you're saying, "You don't know how mean
[2:39:19] he is." You don't know how mean she is.
[2:39:21] Listen, God knows
[2:39:23] and he knows how to change somebody.
[2:39:26] He's changed many of us in this room,
[2:39:28] and he's still in the changing business.
[2:39:32] But I've had this infirmity all of these
[2:39:35] years, and every time I I got to where I
[2:39:38] could get in the water,
[2:39:41] somebody beat me in.
[2:39:44] How many of you know his answer was
[2:39:46] standing right there.
[2:39:49] He didn't need to get in the water. He
[2:39:52] needed only to believe.
[2:39:56] I don't know what your divine promise
[2:39:58] is, but I'm sure you've got one. I'm
[2:40:00] sure somebody said, "I I maybe I've
[2:40:02] never received a personal promise from
[2:40:04] the Lord." The book's full of them. The
[2:40:06] Bible is full of them. The Bible is full
[2:40:08] of promises that are yay and amen. The
[2:40:10] message of the hour is full of promises
[2:40:13] for the last day bride that are yay and
[2:40:15] amen. Can we believe?
[2:40:21] Lord, we must.
[2:40:23] We must. Benjamin, lead us in worship.
[2:40:27] And we'll come back in just a moment and
[2:40:29] pray.
[2:40:30] I want you to take this as your
[2:40:31] opportunity to claim. I claim it. It's
[2:40:36] mine.
[2:40:37] Let your faith rise up now as we worship
[2:40:40] him in spirit and in truth. And we'll
[2:40:43] pray in just a moment.
[2:40:48] All throughout my history,
[2:40:55] come and worship him. faithfulness has
[2:40:57] walked beside me.
[2:41:00] You're a faithful God.
[2:41:02] The winter storms made way for spring
[2:41:08] [Music]
[2:41:09] in every season.
[2:41:12] From where I'm standing,
[2:41:17] I see the evidence of your goodness.
[2:41:21] Is that your testimony?
[2:41:23] All over my life. Come get your promise.
[2:41:25] Come on.
[2:41:26] All over my eyes.
[2:41:31] And I see your promises in fulfillment
[2:41:37] all over my life.
[2:41:41] All over my life.
[2:41:44] Oh yes.
[2:41:46] And all throughout my history.
[2:41:51] Jesus,
[2:41:53] your faithfulness has walked beside me.
[2:42:01] The winter storms made way for spring.
[2:42:05] [Music]
[2:42:08] In every season from where I'm standing,
[2:42:15] I see the evidence of your goodness.
[2:42:20] You've given me no
[2:42:21] all over my life. Lord,
[2:42:24] oh my life.
[2:42:29] Oh, and I see your promises in
[2:42:32] fulfillment
[2:42:35] all over my life.
[2:42:38] They're all over my life.
[2:42:42] Oh,
[2:42:44] and I see the evidence of your goodness
[2:42:49] all over my life.
[2:42:50] All over my life. Oh, it's all over my
[2:42:55] life.
[2:42:58] And I see your promises in fulfillment.
[2:43:02] [Music]
[2:43:04] All over my life.
[2:43:08] All over my life.
[2:43:11] Help
[2:43:13] me remember that when I'm weak
[2:43:20] that fear will come but fear will leave.
[2:43:27] You lead my heart to victory.
[2:43:35] You are my strength and you always
[2:43:40] will be. And I see the evidence of your
[2:43:45] goodness
[2:43:47] all over my life. Lord, it's all over my
[2:43:53] life.
[2:43:54] Oh,
[2:43:56] and I see your promises in fulfillment
[2:44:02] all over my life.
[2:44:04] Oh, they're all over my life. Oh, I see.
[2:44:10] And I see the evidence of your goodness.
[2:44:16] All over my life. Oh, they're all over
[2:44:20] my life.
[2:44:23] Oh,
[2:44:25] and I see your promises in fulfillment
[2:44:30] all over my life.
[2:44:34] All over my life
[2:44:39] I see the cross, the empty grave.
[2:44:42] The evidence it's sinless.
[2:44:46] All my sin was rolled away
[2:44:49] because of you. Oh Jesus.
[2:44:53] I see the cross, the empty grave. The
[2:44:57] evidence is sinless.
[2:45:00] All my sin was rolled away
[2:45:04] because of you. Oh Jesus.
[2:45:07] I see the cross, the empty grave.
[2:45:11] The evidence it's sinless.
[2:45:14] All my sin was rolled away.
[2:45:18] Because of you, oh Jesus,
[2:45:21] I see the cross, the empty grave.
[2:45:25] The evidence is sinless.
[2:45:28] All my sin was rolled away
[2:45:32] because of you, oh Jesus.
[2:45:35] Oh,
[2:45:39] and I see the evidence of your goodness.
[2:45:44] Oh, it's all over my life. Oh, all over
[2:45:49] my life.
[2:45:53] And I see your promises in fulfillment
[2:45:59] all over my life. Oh, all over my life.
[2:46:06] Lord, we believe that what you have
[2:46:09] done, you are still able to do. And now
[2:46:14] as a body of believers, we join our
[2:46:18] faith together to say, "Lord, you've
[2:46:22] never given us a reason to doubt you.
[2:46:25] You have always been faithful. Your
[2:46:29] goodness has always covered our lives.
[2:46:33] For many of us, it was even when we
[2:46:36] weren't serving you that you protected
[2:46:39] us. your grace reaching for us time and
[2:46:45] time again.
[2:46:47] We've seen you move on our behalf when
[2:46:51] it looked like there was no reason to
[2:46:53] hope. And so today, we bring these
[2:46:57] divine promises back to you.
[2:47:01] Everything that you have said was ours.
[2:47:06] We lift it up to you, Lord.
[2:47:10] like an offering spread before your
[2:47:12] throne.
[2:47:14] And we say, Lord, we believe.
[2:47:18] And when unbelief creeps in, give us
[2:47:21] grace and wisdom to push it down.
[2:47:27] May we soon step into the hour that
[2:47:31] there is no doubt in our heart and we
[2:47:35] can proclaim and decree your word
[2:47:40] without any doubt
[2:47:42] and watch you perform.
[2:47:46] Lord, you showed me one time in in in
[2:47:50] Torqui, England,
[2:47:53] sitting on the balcony overlooking the
[2:47:56] the the English Channel, the bay.
[2:47:59] You showed me that there were angels
[2:48:03] assigned to watch over your promised
[2:48:06] word
[2:48:08] and that even when we couldn't see the
[2:48:11] promise or see the angel, they acted as
[2:48:15] guardians
[2:48:17] over the promise so that it wouldn't
[2:48:19] totally be lost. And in those moments
[2:48:23] that we would forget to lift those
[2:48:26] promises up to you, those angels were
[2:48:29] holding those promises up to you.
[2:48:34] Lord, I'm asking you right now to remind
[2:48:38] us that even in those moments that we
[2:48:41] have failed to dare to believe that you
[2:48:45] have watched over that word and guarded
[2:48:48] it just like you did in the first
[2:48:50] creation.
[2:48:52] And so today, we're stepping up to take
[2:48:55] our place.
[2:48:57] We're going to guard the promises that
[2:48:59] you have swn into us by your word. And
[2:49:03] we're going to knock again. And we're
[2:49:06] going to believe again. And we're going
[2:49:08] to testify again that you are more than
[2:49:12] able.
[2:49:15] Move us.
[2:49:18] Shift us.
[2:49:20] set us where you want us to be
[2:49:24] that we might be better positioned.
[2:49:28] You know what I believe? I believe God
[2:49:31] is setting us up and getting us ready
[2:49:34] for profound miracles.
[2:49:37] [Music]
[2:49:41] I don't believe that God is emphasizing
[2:49:43] faith just to waste our time.
[2:49:47] I believe God is looking for some folks
[2:49:49] among us who will dare to believe
[2:49:54] even the crazy promises.
[2:49:58] The ones that seem impossible. Oh yes.
[2:50:07] I'm just wondering who will be one of
[2:50:09] those.
[2:50:10] Who will be one of those that will just
[2:50:12] step up and claim the promise? No matter
[2:50:15] what it looks like, no matter how wild
[2:50:18] it sounds, if God said it, you'll just
[2:50:21] take him at his word and believe. Let
[2:50:24] let's let's believe that there will be
[2:50:26] those among us who will recognize the
[2:50:28] place where they have become callous in
[2:50:31] their faith and they will begin to uh
[2:50:34] believe that God will pour oil
[2:50:38] on those callous places of our faith
[2:50:42] that they would be nimble again and that
[2:50:44] our faith could be proactive again.
[2:50:49] Jesus,
[2:50:52] you promised the royal seed of Abraham
[2:50:55] that we would inherit and walk in the
[2:50:57] faith of Abraham who called those things
[2:51:00] that are not
[2:51:02] as though they are.
[2:51:05] So today, Lord, I'm asking you to raise
[2:51:07] up. It only takes a handful among us
[2:51:11] to begin to believe, to dare, to
[2:51:13] believe, to dare to testify to one
[2:51:17] another that there is nothing impossible
[2:51:19] with you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:51:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:51:26] Hallelujah. Give him your need right
[2:51:28] now. Lord, I believe. Give him your
[2:51:31] need, Lord. I believe for my own body.
[2:51:34] Lord, I believe right now, Lord. I
[2:51:36] believe for my loved ones right now. I
[2:51:38] believe for broken relationships in my
[2:51:41] family. Tell him right now, Lord, I
[2:51:43] believe. I believe for full restoration.
[2:51:48] Lord, I believe that that all of my
[2:51:50] children are going to find their
[2:51:51] position in the kingdom in these last
[2:51:54] days. Lord, I believe.
[2:51:57] Lord, I believe all my grandchildren are
[2:52:00] going to be lined up with God's purposes
[2:52:02] in the end time. It looks impossible,
[2:52:05] but I'm going to say, "Be it unto me
[2:52:07] according to thy word." I dare to
[2:52:09] believe. I'm going to dare to testify.
[2:52:12] I'm going to find me a neighbor to tell.
[2:52:14] I'm going to find somebody. I'm going to
[2:52:16] find a brother or a sister to tell that
[2:52:18] I am holding on.
[2:52:22] Refusing to let go.
[2:52:24] I'm going to see my bulldog faith
[2:52:26] activated for my promise right now. And
[2:52:29] I'm not going to worry. Somebody needs
[2:52:31] to confess. I'm not going to worry. I'm
[2:52:34] not going to fret. I'm going to take God
[2:52:38] at his word.
[2:52:40] I'm going to quit begging and I'm going
[2:52:43] to start declaring.
[2:52:49] She will have. She will have. She will
[2:52:53] have. Thus sayaith the Lord.
[2:52:56] Or she will keep still.
[2:52:58] Lord, we ask you right now. Would you
[2:53:01] join your faith with someone near you
[2:53:03] before we go?
[2:53:05] You don't have to know their need.
[2:53:08] Just say, "Lord, I come into agreement
[2:53:09] right now with the faith of my sister,
[2:53:12] with my brother. I don't know what their
[2:53:14] need is, particularly the one they're
[2:53:16] holding before you right now, but Lord,
[2:53:18] you do." Hallelujah. Make sure that most
[2:53:21] everyone has somebody to agree with them
[2:53:23] right now. I agree, Lord, with the faith
[2:53:26] of my brother. I agree with the faith of
[2:53:28] my sister right now. I believe for total
[2:53:31] healing. I believe for total
[2:53:33] restoration. Hallelujah.
[2:53:45] Now I feel faith.
[2:53:49] Faith can be felt. It can be tangible at
[2:53:53] times.
[2:53:54] I'm feeling faith rising.
[2:53:58] It's the power of agreement
[2:54:00] because you took the time and cared
[2:54:02] enough to say, "I'm coming into
[2:54:04] agreement with your faith for whatever
[2:54:07] you're believing God for." Hallelujah.
[2:54:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:54:13] Lord, I believe a buyer is on the way to
[2:54:15] buy my house. Lord, I believe a buyer is
[2:54:18] on the way to buy my propert. Lord, I
[2:54:21] believe you've got my next place. Come
[2:54:23] on,
[2:54:24] Lord. I believe.
[2:54:33] I don't know how I'll ever find somebody
[2:54:35] to give me what it's worth. That's not a
[2:54:37] confession you want to make.
[2:54:40] Lord, I believe that you're preparing
[2:54:42] somebody right now
[2:54:45] for their next chapter and to help me
[2:54:47] get to mine.
[2:54:49] Praising you.
[2:54:51] I'm praising you right now.
[2:54:54] I'm just helping somebody. Come on.
[2:55:03] My God.
[2:55:08] Jesus.
[2:55:11] You said whosoever had the faith to say
[2:55:14] to the mountain, "Be thou removed and
[2:55:16] plucked into the sea,
[2:55:20] And the prophet of God tells us that
[2:55:22] we're not waiting to see the mountain
[2:55:23] moved all the way before we start
[2:55:25] praising and confessing and believing.
[2:55:27] He said, "If just one grain of sand
[2:55:29] rolls down the other side, we've got
[2:55:31] something to praise God for." Sometimes
[2:55:34] God moves it all at one time and
[2:55:36] sometimes he moves it a spoonful at a
[2:55:38] time. But nonetheless, he's worthy. He's
[2:55:41] worthy. He's worthy to be praised. I can
[2:55:44] take him at his word.
[2:55:49] He signed my check.
[2:55:52] When he says it, I have no reason to
[2:55:55] doubt. He has all of the resources to
[2:55:58] fulfill his promise.
[2:56:00] But it's a hard case. Let me tell you
[2:56:02] something. There are no hard cases with
[2:56:05] God.
[2:56:08] But so and so is an atheist and he
[2:56:10] doesn't believe in God. Remember what
[2:56:13] we've told you. God doesn't believe in
[2:56:14] atheist.
[2:56:16] Hallelujah.
[2:56:18] How can you be bitter and blame a God
[2:56:19] for something when you don't believe
[2:56:21] there is a God? That doesn't make any
[2:56:23] sense, does it? There are no hard cases.
[2:56:27] Lord, break through the veils of
[2:56:28] darkness and doubt and unbelief.
[2:56:31] Untangle the mindsets that are so
[2:56:34] satanically inspired. Untangle those
[2:56:37] mindsets. Lord, I'm asking you right now
[2:56:40] to untangle the wires
[2:56:42] right now and let faith be born in the
[2:56:45] heart like a little but like a little
[2:56:47] button, like a little tiny light. Let
[2:56:49] faith begin to to show up and shine.
[2:56:54] Jesus,
[2:56:58] let somebody make up their mind to get
[2:57:01] out of the boat. Yes,
[2:57:04] [Music]
[2:57:06] Lord. I have no desire to drown today.
[2:57:10] Nevertheless, at thy word,
[2:57:13] I'll come.
[2:57:15] I'll come. I'll get out of the boat.
[2:57:19] I'll trust my future in your hands.
[2:57:22] Sink, swim, or die.
[2:57:25] I'm going to put my confidence
[2:57:29] in the God whose love is chasing me,
[2:57:32] whose goodness and mercy is chasing me.
[2:57:34] I want us to stretch our hands now to
[2:57:37] the Lord. And I want you to thank him as
[2:57:39] though the answer has already come to
[2:57:42] manifestation. As though you've already
[2:57:44] seen the materialization of what you
[2:57:46] believe for. I want you to thank him as
[2:57:49] it's done. Lord, I thank you right now
[2:57:52] that your word is accomplished in my
[2:57:54] life. I I thank you that we have
[2:57:57] appropriated victory.
[2:58:00] Hey
[2:58:02] Lord, I thank you right now.
[2:58:05] Somebody needs to call the thing done.
[2:58:08] Name it. You don't have to scream it.
[2:58:10] Name it quietly.
[2:58:14] Name it quietly right now. Somebody
[2:58:17] needs to let it come out of your mouth.
[2:58:19] It can come out as a whisper. If it's
[2:58:21] private, you don't have to shout it, but
[2:58:24] speak it right now. I thank you, Lord.
[2:58:32] That bill is paid. I thank you that the
[2:58:35] debt is canceled.
[2:58:37] I thank you that you've made a way.
[2:58:40] [Music]
[2:58:46] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:58:49] Hallelujah.
[2:58:50] I'm waiting on someone who will just
[2:58:52] lift your voice before you go and give
[2:58:55] God a praise. Come on.
[2:59:00] I don't know what to say. They say,
[2:59:01] "Hey,
[2:59:02] [Music]
[2:59:04] hallelujah.
[2:59:08] It's mine.
[2:59:10] It's mine.
[2:59:14] It's mine.
[2:59:17] I may not deserve it, but it's mine
[2:59:23] because you said it was. That's the
[2:59:26] evidence. You said it.
[2:59:28] That's the evidence. You said it
[2:59:32] and I believe it
[2:59:35] all over my life.
[2:59:39] All over my life
[2:59:44] I see your promises in fulfillment
[2:59:49] time and time again.
[2:59:50] All over my life. Oh, they're all over
[2:59:54] my life.
[2:59:59] And I see the evidence of your goodness
[3:00:05] all over my life. Oh, it's all over my
[3:00:10] life.
[3:00:12] Oh,
[3:00:14] and I see your promises in fulfillment.
[3:00:18] All over my life.
[3:00:19] All over my life.
[3:00:23] All over my life.
[3:00:24] Bring the music down and I want to hear
[3:00:26] the voices singing. This is a testimony.
[3:00:29] I see the evidence of your goodness
[3:00:35] all over my life.
[3:00:39] All over my life.
[3:00:44] And I see your promises in fulfillment
[3:00:51] all over my life.
[3:00:55] All over my life.
[3:00:59] I hear the spirit of the Lord saying he
[3:01:02] is directing you to position yourself.
[3:01:08] [Music]
[3:01:10] He's directing you to position yourself
[3:01:13] to receive the promise.
[3:01:15] Somebody said, "I have no idea what that
[3:01:17] means." If you need rain, you better dig
[3:01:19] a ditch.
[3:01:20] [Music]
[3:01:22] If you need God to supply your need so
[3:01:24] the debt can be paid, you need to borrow
[3:01:26] some vessels.
[3:01:28] These are symbol. We're talking about
[3:01:30] symbolically. You need to do something
[3:01:33] symbolically
[3:01:35] in faith. We call it prophetic act. You
[3:01:38] need to do something that will symbolize
[3:01:41] your positioning to receive the promise.
[3:01:46] Lord, I'm doing that right now.
[3:01:50] I'm going to get my little shoe box and
[3:01:52] bring it with me.
[3:01:53] Oh, yeah.
[3:01:54] Believing for my feet to be made whole.
[3:01:56] See, it's the same kind. It's the same
[3:01:58] kind of thing.
[3:02:01] It's the same kind of thing.
[3:02:04] I'm going to believe the Lord.
[3:02:07] I'm going to ask him to to direct me to
[3:02:10] position myself.
[3:02:13] Somebody's going to have to have a shift
[3:02:15] in your vocabulary. But God knows how to
[3:02:17] do that.
[3:02:20] And somebody keeps saying, "I don't
[3:02:21] know. I don't know. I don't know." You
[3:02:23] do know because the evidence is in the
[3:02:25] word. You do know.
[3:02:28] You do know.
[3:02:30] Faith is in the room.
[3:02:33] Lord, we believe.
[3:02:40] Only
[3:02:43] believe.
[3:02:45] [Music]
[3:02:48] Only
[3:02:50] believe.
[3:02:55] Only
[3:02:57] believe
[3:03:01] all things.
[3:03:06] [Music]
[3:03:11] [Music]
[3:03:25] mama. God's going to bring healing to
[3:03:28] your child. Hold on.
[3:03:31] Hold on right now. God's going to do
[3:03:34] some rewiring.
[3:03:38] Hold on to him right now. Lord, I
[3:03:40] believe
[3:03:46] that all things,
[3:03:51] [Music]
[3:04:03] holy, holy,
[3:04:09] holy.
[3:04:12] [Music]
[3:04:18] Somebody should expect an answer in the
[3:04:21] mailbox.
[3:04:24] Expect it.
[3:04:30] Hallelujah.
[3:04:31] [Music]
[3:04:33] All things
[3:04:35] are possible.
[3:04:38] Only
[3:04:40] believe.
[3:04:44] Only
[3:04:46] believe.
[3:04:47] [Music]
[3:04:52] [Music]
[3:05:00] Someone is concerned about an unhealthy
[3:05:03] relationship
[3:05:06] that one of your family members has
[3:05:09] and you are able to clearly see that it
[3:05:13] is unhealthy and that it is not of God.
[3:05:17] And the Lord wants you to be reminded
[3:05:20] that he is going to sever that. He's
[3:05:23] going to cut that off. Your loved one is
[3:05:27] not going to lose their destiny.
[3:05:30] Hallelujah.
[3:05:32] He's going to bring an end to an
[3:05:34] unhealthy and ungodly relationship.
[3:05:39] Praise him.
[3:05:42] You ought to know that more than one can
[3:05:44] can claim a promise.
[3:05:50] Oh Lord,
[3:05:53] I believe.
[3:05:55] Woo!
[3:05:59] [Music]
[3:06:05] [Music]
[3:06:10] [Music]
[3:06:29] [Music]
[3:06:34] Would you just greet the saints? Would
[3:06:36] you just turn to someone and give them a
[3:06:39] big God bless you?
[3:06:42] Tell them you're going to agree with
[3:06:44] their faith
[3:06:46] for whatever they're believing for.
[3:06:50] [Music]
[3:06:52] I'm going to help you pray it through.
[3:06:57] [Music]
[3:07:05] [Music]
[3:07:13] [Music]
[3:07:15] Um,
[3:07:20] I I just heard this phrase
[3:07:23] clearly from the Lord. Every little baby
[3:07:26] needs a bed.
[3:07:31] Every little baby needs a bed.
[3:07:34] [Music]
[3:07:38] Lord, I believe.
[3:07:41] Lord, I believe. I don't have to
[3:07:43] understand it. Lord, I believe. Lord, I
[3:07:46] believe.
[3:07:50] Lord,
[3:07:52] I believe.
[3:07:55] That all things
[3:08:09] Jesus
[3:08:10] is
[3:08:12] singing it. Sing it.
[3:08:22] [Music]
[3:08:27] Jesus.
[3:08:30] Oh Jesus
[3:08:34] is here.
[3:08:37] Jesus
[3:08:40] is here. All things, all things are
[3:08:46] possible.
[3:08:49] Jesus
[3:08:50] [Music]
[3:08:52] is here.
[3:08:55] Lord, to the best of our ability, we
[3:08:58] take you at your word.
[3:09:04] We don't have to understand it to
[3:09:06] believe it.
[3:09:09] Lord, as we leave this house today, it's
[3:09:12] been good to be in your presence.
[3:09:15] For some, it's been good to be reminded
[3:09:19] that faith in God can move mighty
[3:09:21] mountains.
[3:09:23] It can change impossible situations.
[3:09:27] And we're going to we're going to quit
[3:09:29] living below our means. And we're going
[3:09:31] to start claiming what you promised to
[3:09:33] us
[3:09:35] and watching mountains move.
[3:09:37] Yes.
[3:09:39] Lord, go with the saints today. Many
[3:09:41] tired and weary, and they're going to
[3:09:43] need a refreshing
[3:09:46] for the work week ahead.
[3:09:49] Lord,
[3:09:49] many mommies losing sleep at night, and
[3:09:52] they're going to need your your uh
[3:09:54] peace, and they're going to need
[3:09:56] supernatural rest. Jesus,
[3:10:02] grant it, Lord, as we leave. Let us go
[3:10:04] with peace.
[3:10:06] Father, bless our fellowship in little
[3:10:09] while when we gather there at the
[3:10:12] tabernacle
[3:10:14] to have a meal together. Let the
[3:10:16] fellowship be sweet.
[3:10:24] We ask these things in the name of the
[3:10:27] Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory. And
[3:10:30] the saints said,
[3:10:31] "Amen."
[3:10:32] God bless you. You are dismissed to go
[3:10:34] today in the name of the Lord. Take the
[3:10:38] faith with you. Would you put it in
[3:10:40] practice this week?
[3:10:42] [Music]
[3:10:44] Keep in mind that some will
[3:10:47] run and have to get their hot food over
[3:10:51] here.
[3:10:53] But we're going to ask you to stay.
[3:10:54] You're welcome to stay for a meal. And
[3:10:57] it will be put together there at the
[3:10:59] bottom of the hill. And I believe
[3:11:02] there'll be enough for everyone to enjoy
[3:11:05] themselves.
[3:11:08] We have so much to be thankful for.
[3:11:10] Amen.
[3:11:12] Consider yourself dismissed now as you
[3:11:15] just start going out. Do your real
[3:11:17] fellowshipping in the hall. Would you?
[3:11:21] Lord,
[3:11:24] I believe.
[3:11:27] Lord,
[3:11:30] God bless you, darling.
[3:11:33] All things
[3:11:36] are possible.
[3:11:40] Lord, I
[3:11:42] believe.
[3:11:46] Lord, I believe.
[3:11:50] [Music]
[3:12:00] [Music]
[3:12:01] Lord, I'm asking you to go to brother
[3:12:03] Garvis.
[3:12:06] Lord, I'm asking you to work a miracle
[3:12:09] in his body today.
[3:12:16] We refuse the doctor's report and we we
[3:12:19] claim
[3:12:21] with brother David man and with brother
[3:12:24] Garvis. We claim the report of the Lord.
[3:12:31] Step into that intensive care room, Lord
[3:12:34] Jesus.
[3:12:36] Touch those kidneys.
[3:12:40] Take charge of his blood pressure. Lord,
[3:12:45] awaken those kidneys. I pray.
[3:12:50] Give him a miracle, Lord. Again.
[3:12:59] Lord. We believe.
[3:13:02] We believe.
[3:13:07] Lord, the streamers who have
[3:13:10] watched these services with need.
[3:13:12] Someone requested prayer for
[3:13:16] a lady plagued with cancer.
[3:13:20] Lord, cancer can't stand in the way of
[3:13:24] faith.
[3:13:25] We ask you to bring healing, Lord, to
[3:13:30] that one.
[3:13:33] Healing is not what you do. A healer is
[3:13:36] who you are.
[3:13:38] Lord, come and be Jesus in that body.
[3:13:43] We give you praise.
[3:13:47] Lord,
[3:13:50] I believe.
[3:13:54] Lord,
[3:13:56] I believe.
[3:14:00] All things are possible.
[3:14:06] Lord, I
[3:14:11] Oh Lord,
[3:14:14] I believe.
[3:14:18] Lord, I
[3:14:21] believe
[3:14:23] all things
[3:14:36] Thank you Jesus.
[3:14:38] Thank you Jesus. Thank you Jesus.
[3:14:42] Amen.
