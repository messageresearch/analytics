[2:06] technology that helps us to visit from
[2:09] time to time and that's what we're doing
[2:11] today we're closing our Series today on
[2:15] uh the difference between uh
[2:18] intellectual Faith a mental concept of
[2:21] faith and what we call Spirit revealed
[2:25] Faith or Faith by Revelation you know
[2:28] when we look at the scripture
[2:30] uh in the book of Hebrews and and we
[2:33] read about the faith we call that the
[2:36] Hall of Faith chapter Hebrews uh uh
[2:38] chapter 11 and we read about all those
[2:41] great men of God by Faith by faith this
[2:45] one by faith that one well let's do it
[2:48] um I think we have time to glance at it
[2:51] uh I wasn't going to read it but let's
[2:53] let's just look there Hebrews chap
[2:56] 11 there's some amazing uh testimonies
[2:59] here that I love so much it starts off
[3:02] with the definition of faith faith is
[3:04] the substance of things hoped for the
[3:07] evidence of Things Not Seen and then it
[3:10] goes on by faith Abel by faith Enoch by
[3:14] faith Noah by faith
[3:17] Abraham uh it goes on it talks a lot
[3:20] about Abraham by faith Jacob by faith
[3:24] Joseph by faith
[3:26] Moses and it talks quite a bit about the
[3:29] Ministry of Moses and then it comes to
[3:32] the end and and he said what shall I say
[3:35] more for the time would fail me to tell
[3:38] you of Gideon of Barack of Samson David
[3:41] and Samuel and of the prophets who
[3:44] through faith subdued kingdoms wrought
[3:48] righteousness this is verse 33 obtained
[3:51] promises stopped the mouth of lions
[3:54] quench the violence of fire escape the
[3:57] edge of the sword out of weakness were
[4:00] made strong waxed Valiant in fight
[4:03] turned to flight the armies of the
[4:05] aliens women received their dead raised
[4:08] to life again others were tortured not
[4:11] accepting Deliverance that they might
[4:13] obtain a better resurrection and others
[4:16] had trial of cruel mockings and
[4:20] scourgings yay moreover of bonds and
[4:22] imprisonment they were stoned they were
[4:25] saw aunder were tempted were slain with
[4:28] a sword they wandered about in sheep
[4:31] skins and goat skins being destitute
[4:35] Afflicted tormented listen at verse 38
[4:38] of whom the world was not worthy they
[4:42] wandered in deserts and mountains and
[4:43] dens and caves of the earth and these
[4:46] all having obtained a good report
[4:49] through faith receed not the promise God
[4:53] having provided some better thing for us
[4:56] that they without us should not not be
[5:00] made perfect and the next verse is so
[5:02] powerful because it talks about that
[5:04] great cloud of witnesses what cloud is
[5:08] he talking about what Witnesses is he
[5:11] talking about all of these mentioned and
[5:14] and described in the great chapter of
[5:18] Faith the Hall of Faith Hebrews chapter
[5:20] 11 I want you to know in order to face
[5:24] the circumstances that these men and
[5:26] women faced they needed more and just a
[5:30] mental concept of belief of Faith they
[5:33] needed a deep Revelation and I've often
[5:37] preached from Hebrews 11 and I've said
[5:40] you could easily replace that word faith
[5:43] you could say by Revelation Enoch was
[5:46] translated by Revelation Abel offered
[5:50] unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
[5:54] Cain um by Revelation they passed
[5:57] through the Red Sea by faith
[6:00] Moses when he was born was hid three
[6:03] months of his parents we could say by
[6:05] Revelation because this is the kind of
[6:08] faith that doesn't come by just
[6:11] receiving facts or by information it
[6:14] comes as a work of the Holy Spirit and
[6:17] and I'm just asking the Lord I've been
[6:19] asking him during this series uh that he
[6:22] would take your faith to another level
[6:25] that he would just speak to you by his
[6:27] spirit and and let your think so your
[6:31] hope so your maybe so become I know so a
[6:36] deep Foundation of Faith um we were
[6:39] studying Peter in this series so I want
[6:42] to tie that in here now uh and kind of
[6:45] close with Peter because we talked about
[6:47] a lot of things we talked about Peter's
[6:50] denial we we talked about how Peter
[6:52] rebuked the Lord and how he denied his
[6:56] relationship with the Lord we talked
[6:58] about how God gave Peter a real
[7:00] revelation of who he was and then we
[7:03] talked about in Acts chapter 2 when what
[7:06] Peter really needed was the infusion of
[7:08] God's life that he received on the day
[7:11] of Pentecost in the upper room because
[7:14] Peter went from a denier to a testifier
[7:17] I mean he stood up with boldness and
[7:19] courage and said wait a minute this
[7:21] these men are not drunk as you suppose
[7:24] this is that which was spoken of by the
[7:26] prophet Joel and he went on and said you
[7:29] know this Jesus that you have taken and
[7:32] done what you wanted to do with him and
[7:34] crucified him uh he was the promised
[7:37] Messiah and and Peter in Acts chapter 2
[7:40] goes through some of the Messianic
[7:42] prophecies of the prophets and he says
[7:45] this was him this was him so he did a
[7:48] bold thing to to testify to all those
[7:51] who were gathered in Jerusalem and I
[7:54] love that because it speaks of that
[7:57] transformation that took place in his
[7:59] life and there's something special that
[8:02] that goes in between his denial and his
[8:07] great sermon in in the book of Acts in
[8:10] Chapter 2 and it it has to do with the
[8:13] resurrection so I wanted to share that
[8:15] to kind of just close this off with
[8:17] Peter for this study in Mark chapter
[8:21] 16 beginning in verse one it says and
[8:24] when the Sabbath was passed Mary
[8:27] Magdalene and Mary the Mother of James
[8:30] and salom had brought bought sweet
[8:34] spices that they might come and anoint
[8:37] him and very early in the morning the
[8:41] first day of the week they came unto the
[8:44] supper at the rising of the Sun and they
[8:48] said among themselves who shall roll us
[8:51] away the Stone from the door of the
[8:54] Seiler and when they looked they saw
[8:57] that the stone was rolled away for it
[9:00] was very great so they were worried
[9:02] about who would help them get that stone
[9:04] out of the way when they arrived there
[9:06] very early in the morning he was already
[9:10] risen we understand that the the Jewish
[9:13] Day you know the biblical day starts
[9:16] with the sun uh when the Sun goes down a
[9:20] new day begins not when the sun comes up
[9:23] the next morning so when the Sabbath was
[9:25] passed that would have been at sundown
[9:28] so somewhere between Sundown and when
[9:30] the and when these ladies get to the
[9:33] Tomb at
[9:34] Sunrise something has already happened
[9:37] and the stone is already moved out of
[9:39] the way and entering into the Seiler
[9:42] verse 5 Mark 16 they saw a young man
[9:47] sitting on the right side clothed in a
[9:51] long white garment and they were arried
[9:54] and he saith unto them be not afed ye
[9:57] seek Jesus of Nazareth
[9:59] which was crucified he is risen
[10:05] Hallelujah I I can't say it without
[10:07] feeling it because it's some of the best
[10:10] news that's ever been spoken in the
[10:12] history of the world he is risen he is
[10:18] not here behold the place where they
[10:22] laid him but go your way tell his
[10:26] disciples and Peter that he go before
[10:30] you into Galilee there shall ye see him
[10:33] and he said unto you and they went out
[10:36] quickly and fled from the Seiler for
[10:39] they trembled and were amazed neither
[10:41] said they anything to any man for they
[10:44] were afraid now I've heard amazing
[10:46] sermons preached from these verses of
[10:49] scripture and I've heard people say oh
[10:52] he called out to his disciples but he
[10:55] separated Peter over here as a
[10:58] backslider the disciples and Peter
[11:00] because Peter was no longer a disciple I
[11:03] don't believe that at all I believe that
[11:06] this was a very special call to Peter I
[11:10] believe that Jesus had so much
[11:13] compassion for for the failure and the
[11:17] effect of the failure on Peter's life he
[11:20] went out bitterly when the words of the
[11:22] Lord came to pass and the rooster uh let
[11:25] out his big old cockadoodle doo and and
[11:28] it broke his heart heart and he could
[11:30] have easily given up but I believe the
[11:33] Lord Jesus after he was raised from the
[11:36] dead was issuing a special call to Peter
[11:40] come back to your destiny son you you
[11:43] blew it you certainly failed but I knew
[11:47] you were going see after all that didn't
[11:49] catch the Lord by surprise what Peter
[11:51] did was exactly what God knew he was
[11:54] going to do he even told him ahead of
[11:56] time uh when by by the time the
[11:59] cross you will have already denied me
[12:01] three times and Peter you know he
[12:03] already had this overconfidence in
[12:05] himself not so you know all men may be
[12:08] offended at you Lord but I will never be
[12:10] offended and everyone will may deny you
[12:13] but I would never deny you I'm willing
[12:15] to go with you even unto death that was
[12:17] a confession based on what Peter thought
[12:20] he knew about his faith that was a
[12:23] mental conception but Peter needed the
[12:26] upper room and this is exactly what
[12:29] Jesus was doing after the resurrection
[12:31] he was calling Peter to the upper room
[12:33] you go tell my disciples and Peter that
[12:37] he goeth before you into Galilee there
[12:40] you shall see him as he said unto you
[12:43] don't leave Peter out and and so for me
[12:46] this is so encouraging because I have
[12:49] failed him along the way and I'm sure
[12:52] that maybe you have to if you've been
[12:54] serving him for any amount of time and
[12:56] Jesus wanted to make sure that Peter
[12:59] didn't miss his invitation to meet him
[13:02] in the Galilee and so for me it was not
[13:05] an exclusion it was actually a royal
[13:08] invitation you go tell my disciples and
[13:12] Peter basically he's saying Peter get
[13:15] back to your destiny call you've
[13:17] wallowed around in your self-pity from
[13:20] the way you failed and how you Den not
[13:22] you have just graveled around in that
[13:24] long enough Peter get up to Galilee I
[13:27] want to see you I'm looking forward to
[13:29] meeting you there and and I just believe
[13:32] the same thing is going on even in this
[13:35] hour that God is issuing a call let it
[13:38] be today through this Eagle cry
[13:40] broadcast that God is issuing a call
[13:43] someone failed someone Fallen by the way
[13:46] and you've just nearly given up and
[13:49] there's a call going forth to you today
[13:51] get up get out of your self-pity get out
[13:55] of that shame and condemnation maybe
[13:57] you've really embarrassed yourself maybe
[13:59] you've embarrassed your family maybe
[14:01] you've failed in Ministry and and so you
[14:04] just give up might as well just give up
[14:06] now no you might as well not give up you
[14:10] might as well let your faith be elevated
[14:14] and anointed to get a hold of a promise
[14:17] that will hold you when you no longer
[14:20] have the strength to hold on to it these
[14:22] are the precious promises that God has
[14:25] given us in our life so real so sure
[14:29] um we the the Bible talks about us
[14:31] having a more excellent way a provided
[14:34] way that is more excellent for us and I
[14:37] am so thankful to be walking in God's
[14:41] provided way for my life even when I do
[14:44] miss his his call uh there are times
[14:47] that I I I I try to hear his voice in
[14:51] certain areas but I miss it and it I
[14:54] hope it doesn't happen often but when it
[14:56] happens we're you're you're just filled
[14:59] with guilt you feel so terrible that you
[15:01] miss the Lord and and so what an
[15:04] encouragement that Jesus made this
[15:07] special call to Peter get up boy dust
[15:10] yourself off just like we say to our
[15:12] children when something like that
[15:14] happens and we're so afraid that because
[15:17] they fell off their bicycle they'll
[15:19] never get back on a bicycle again
[15:21] because we've seen that happen and so we
[15:23] say to them you get up right now and let
[15:26] me help dust you off and and and let me
[15:29] soothe your wounds let me wash your cuts
[15:32] and then I want you to get right back up
[15:34] on that bicycle and ride again and I
[15:36] believe the Lord you know the one thing
[15:39] that I know I know lots of things about
[15:41] him because he's made them real in my
[15:43] life but one of the things I appreciate
[15:45] about him so much is he's the god of
[15:48] Second Chances and he allows you turns
[15:52] and when you realize that you are going
[15:54] in the wrong direction you have an
[15:57] opportunity to hear his call and to turn
[16:00] around and come back let me give you an
[16:02] example in the scripture uh as we finish
[16:05] up this series on really we're not just
[16:08] comparing the two faiths we're saying
[16:11] that we need a transformation from from
[16:14] one faith that mental Faith to to a
[16:17] spirit revealed Faith um brother Brandon
[16:20] was preaching along those lines one time
[16:21] and he said we just need the streams of
[16:24] Grace the rivers of Grace to pour down
[16:27] on our intellect ual faith our mental
[16:30] faith and transform it into a faith that
[16:33] is Spirit revealed that will not uh give
[16:37] up when the when the details and when
[16:39] the circumstances are ugly Luke chap
[16:43] 24 and verse 13 I think I have time to
[16:47] read these verses and behold two of them
[16:50] went that same day to a village called
[16:53] emus which was from Jerusalem three
[16:56] score furlongs and they walked together
[16:59] uh and they talked together of all these
[17:01] things which had happened and it came to
[17:03] pass that while they communed together
[17:06] and reasoned Jesus himself Drew near and
[17:10] went with them can you imagine but their
[17:12] eyes were Holden that they should not
[17:15] know him and he said unto them what
[17:17] manner of communications are these that
[17:20] you have one to another as you walk and
[17:23] are sad and the one of them whose name
[17:25] was Copus answered and said unto him art
[17:28] th th only a stranger in Jerusalem and
[17:31] Hast not known the things which are come
[17:34] to pass there in these days and he said
[17:37] unto them what things and they said unto
[17:40] him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which
[17:43] was a prophet Mighty in deed and word
[17:46] before God and all the people they
[17:48] didn't even realize they're talking to
[17:51] him and how the chief priest and our
[17:53] rulers delivered him to be condemned to
[17:55] death and have crucified him but we
[17:59] trusted that it had been he which should
[18:01] have redeemed Israel and beside all this
[18:04] today is the third day since these
[18:06] things were done what the third day he
[18:09] had just risen from the dead and was now
[18:12] appearing to them verse 22 Y and certain
[18:15] women also of our company made us
[18:18] astonished which were early at the
[18:20] Seiler we just read it and when they
[18:23] found not his body they came saying that
[18:26] they had also seen a vision of angels
[18:29] which said that he was alive and certain
[18:31] of them which were with us went to the
[18:33] separer and found it even as the women
[18:35] had said but him they saw not then he
[18:39] said unto them this is the Lord now
[18:41] speaking to these two men on the road to
[18:42] Emmas oh fools and slow to heart to
[18:46] believe all that the prophets have
[18:48] spoken ought not Christ ought not
[18:51] Messiah to have suffered these things
[18:54] and to enter into his glory and then
[18:57] listen at what he did he began to preach
[19:00] to them he began to minister to them
[19:03] verse 27 said and beginning at Moses and
[19:07] all the prophets he expounded unto them
[19:10] all the scriptures the things concerning
[19:14] himself can you imagine it was like a
[19:17] bible school with Jesus himself the word
[19:20] made flesh just teaching them all the
[19:24] scriptures and how to connect them
[19:26] together about his own Ministry Ministry
[19:29] and verse 28 and they drew nigh unto the
[19:33] village with they went and he made as
[19:35] though he would have gone further but
[19:37] they constrained him saying abide with
[19:40] us for it is toward evening and the day
[19:44] is far spent and he went into Terry with
[19:46] them it came to pass he sat at meat with
[19:49] them he took bread and blessed it and
[19:51] break it and gave to them and their eyes
[19:56] were opened and they knew him and he
[20:00] vanished out of their sight and they
[20:03] said one to another did not our heart
[20:07] burn within us while he talked with us
[20:10] by the way and while he opened to us the
[20:13] scripture do you hear what was happening
[20:16] it was a
[20:18] revelation they now began to understand
[20:22] when he gave them that physical bread
[20:24] when they took that bread it was blessed
[20:27] and they took it it it created this
[20:30] whole scenario created an atmosphere for
[20:33] Revelation they're not just hearing it
[20:35] taught by the good scribes by the good
[20:38] priest they're hearing it taught by the
[20:41] word himself and the spirit is there to
[20:44] make it real I'm telling you they really
[20:48] realized just a second or two uh too
[20:51] late I I guess that this was the one and
[20:55] and they rose up the same hour and
[20:58] returned to Jerusalem and found the 11
[21:00] gathered together and them that were
[21:02] with them saying the Lord is risen
[21:05] indeed and hath appeared to Simon and
[21:08] they told what things were done in the
[21:10] way and how he was known of them in the
[21:14] breaking of bread I want you to
[21:17] understand what was happening here Jesus
[21:20] found this couple of guys one day
[21:23] walking uh from Jerusalem to the little
[21:26] village out uh near
[21:29] emus we call that the area uh of today
[21:34] near abos it is a village built near the
[21:39] the scriptural Place uh kirat yahim it's
[21:44] a very beautiful place just outside the
[21:47] city you can go up on the hill uh at
[21:50] Karat yharim and see over into Jerusalem
[21:54] it's just one Hill away from the city of
[21:56] Jerusalem and they're walking in that
[21:58] Direction and they're filled with doubt
[22:02] they're filled with in uncertainty
[22:05] because here they believed that this
[22:07] Jesus was the one that the scriptures
[22:10] had spoken about now they watched him
[22:12] die and and crucified and suffer and
[22:16] everything within them is being shaken
[22:19] filled with uncertainty so much so that
[22:23] when they heard this testimony that he
[22:25] was risen from the dead they didn't even
[22:27] know whether to believe believe it or
[22:28] not what a dilemma they were in and we
[22:32] know this because they were going in the
[22:34] wrong direction the word of the Lord was
[22:37] not for them to leave Jerusalem this
[22:39] wasn't a time for them to run in the
[22:41] other way this was a time to stick
[22:43] around and see what was about to take
[22:45] place but they were so shaken and so
[22:48] mentally and emotionally exhausted that
[22:51] they're walking in the wrong direction
[22:53] from Jerusalem they're headed somewhere
[22:55] else perhaps back to their home but the
[22:58] promise was that they should stick
[23:00] around TR around in Jerusalem uh to see
[23:03] what was going to happen because there
[23:05] was power coming and so forth and but
[23:08] they were in essence fleeing away not
[23:11] knowing what to expect and their hopes
[23:14] were kind of dashed and destroyed but I
[23:18] love the fact that Jesus loved those men
[23:21] he loved Copus he loved the other man
[23:23] that was with him so much that he went
[23:26] and found them going in the other
[23:28] direction and that's what I started off
[23:31] a moment ago saying that God allows you
[23:34] turns and sometimes in our discouraging
[23:37] circumstances we sit down and we're not
[23:40] active in doing what God has called us
[23:43] to do and like Peter he failed he dealt
[23:46] with it it was hard and he wasn't really
[23:49] up doing what he ought so Jesus just
[23:51] said go tell my disciples and Peter and
[23:54] the same kind of Mercy he showed here to
[23:57] these two men on the road to emus they
[23:59] didn't come and find him they heard the
[24:02] testimony that he was risen but they
[24:03] didn't stick around to see if it was so
[24:05] or not they were going home now I want
[24:08] you to know something I don't know but I
[24:11] think in my mind if ID have heard this
[24:13] testimony I would have wanted to to to
[24:16] go here and there up and down every
[24:18] street in Jerusalem and see if this were
[24:21] true to prove that indeed he had risen
[24:23] but they are so broken so emotionally
[24:27] spent that they're just going home uh
[24:30] not even staying around to investigate
[24:33] these testimonies of his resurrection
[24:35] but Jesus loved them so much that he
[24:38] went and found them and he he wouldn't
[24:40] even tell them who he was immediately
[24:42] their eyes were kind of blinded to be
[24:44] able to see who he really was and after
[24:47] he made himself known then they said yes
[24:50] indeed did not our hearts burn within us
[24:53] as he talked with us by the way what I
[24:56] see in this story is
[24:58] the love that Jesus has for those who
[25:02] get disillusioned for those who get
[25:05] disappointed for those who want to give
[25:07] up for those who make mistakes and fail
[25:11] his love ever Burns for people like that
[25:15] that's the Jesus that we know one who is
[25:19] more ready to forgive if you ask more
[25:23] ready to restore if you will allow him
[25:26] to than he is to to just disregard your
[25:29] life you see when he called us he knew
[25:33] us in and out up and down all the way
[25:36] around he knew our our qualities he knew
[25:40] our strengths he knew our gifts he also
[25:43] knew our weaknesses he knew our
[25:46] predispositions to sin he knew
[25:49] generational iniquities that followed us
[25:52] that chased us in our lives he knew the
[25:55] end from the beginning the beginning
[25:57] from the end and yet he loved us and yet
[26:00] he called us and he has every intention
[26:03] of continuing to move in our lives and
[26:06] work in us and with us and through us
[26:10] until we become the Glorious reflection
[26:13] of His Image we're growing in this thing
[26:16] I want you to know we go from strength
[26:19] to strength from Grace to Grace from
[26:22] Faith to Faith I like the old testimony
[26:25] that I've heard many times where an old
[26:27] man stood up to testify and he said well
[26:31] I am not what I want to be I am not yet
[26:35] what I ought to be but I thank God that
[26:39] I am certainly not what I used to be and
[26:43] so we can easily get discouraged in the
[26:46] fact that we're not yet where we would
[26:48] desire to be and we give up but that's
[26:51] not what we need to focus on we need to
[26:54] focus on the fact hey I'm not what I
[26:56] used to be I've known know the grace of
[26:59] God I've started on a journey I fell
[27:02] down I've made some mistakes along the
[27:04] way but I get back up because he's there
[27:08] to lift me you know when we're so weak
[27:10] that we can't even pull ourselves up
[27:12] he's there without stretched arms I used
[27:15] to sing a song as a young boy his hand
[27:18] reached farther down than my hand could
[27:21] reach up from the depths of the pit I
[27:24] Cried unto the Lord and he heard me I
[27:27] want you to know he hears you in this
[27:29] hour may God bless you father have mercy
[27:33] on your people today and restore them to
[27:36] complete faith in the name of the Lord
[27:38] Jesus Christ God bless you byebye for
[27:41] now
