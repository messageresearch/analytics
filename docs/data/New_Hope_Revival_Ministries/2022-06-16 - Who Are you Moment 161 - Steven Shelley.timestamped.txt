[0:00] do you know what would happen in your
[0:02] life if you got a true and genuine
[0:05] revelation of who you are in christ
[0:15] but the bible said he was tempted in all
[0:17] manner as we are
[0:19] so you think about your temptation you
[0:21] think about what the enemies tried to
[0:23] pull you into
[0:25] and then you will know that in every way
[0:27] that the enemy tried to tempt you
[0:30] he tried to tempt him whoa
[0:33] and none of it could pull him into
[0:35] unbelief
[0:36] why because he knew who he was somebody
[0:38] said because he was god no
[0:41] because he was god man but it was
[0:44] because he knew who he was
[0:49] he knew who he was he didn't have to go
[0:51] to church to find out who he was
[0:53] in fact when he went to the synagogue in
[0:55] luke chapter 4 the prophecy of isaiah
[0:58] was fulfilled
[0:59] because he recognized who he was by the
[1:02] reading of his own commission and
[1:03] mandate
[1:05] the spirit of the lord is upon me for he
[1:08] hath anointed me to preach
[1:10] he knew exactly who he was and when he
[1:13] went to sit down he left the rostrum by
[1:15] saying this day
[1:17] this scripture is fulfilled in your ears
[1:21] he knew exactly who he was
[1:24] he knew where he had come from
[1:26] he knew where he was going back to
[1:30] and because of that all the enemy could
[1:31] do was tempt him
[1:33] but he could not bring him into unbelief
[1:37] do you know what would happen in your
[1:39] life if you got a true and genuine
[1:42] revelation of who you are in christ
[1:46] and who christ is in you
[1:50] did you know that you would be able to
[1:52] reject every temptation that the enemy
[1:55] would throw in your way because you
[1:58] would recognize you came from god
[2:02] and you're going back to god
[2:05] and nothing that the enemy used against
[2:07] you would be successful
[2:09] brother branham said if that bride has a
[2:12] revelation
[2:14] a real revelation of who she is
[2:18] nothing would be able to touch her
[2:21] nothing would be able to stop her
[2:24] nothing would be able to dissuade her
[2:27] i dare say to that the most important
[2:30] thing for all of us today
[2:33] would be to have a revelation
[2:36] of who we are in christ
[2:40] and who christ is in
[2:44] us
