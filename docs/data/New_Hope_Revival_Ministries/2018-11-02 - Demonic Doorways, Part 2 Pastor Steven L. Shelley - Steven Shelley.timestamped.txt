[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:20] [Music]
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right twiced in
[0:43] you the hope award
[0:45] [Music]
[1:00] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[1:03] Shelley of New Hope revival ministries
[1:06] in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming
[1:09] to you again today in partnership with
[1:12] gospel channel and I'm delighted to be
[1:15] able to come and share with you the good
[1:17] Word of God I am very excited about all
[1:21] of the prayer requests that have been
[1:23] coming in I've been praying over them
[1:26] personally
[1:26] we've been lifting up the folder in
[1:29] front of the congregation and praying
[1:32] and then in our Thursday morning prayer
[1:34] meetings we've had several people to
[1:36] come and lay hands on the folder your
[1:38] needs are being carried before the
[1:40] throne of grace and I'm especially
[1:43] excited about the testimonies people are
[1:47] beginning to call and send emails and
[1:49] say hey the Lord heard and answered
[1:52] prayer I don't know why it is but
[1:54] sometimes we pray and we pray and we
[1:57] believe and then when God answers the
[1:59] prayer it almost shocks us it almost
[2:02] surprises us but we should never be
[2:05] surprised that God answers prayer the
[2:08] Bible says that the effectual fervent
[2:10] prayer of the righteous availeth much
[2:13] and I believe that it is a gift that God
[2:16] has given us
[2:18] I believe prayer is not only a gift it's
[2:20] also a responsibility that we should
[2:23] take seriously and I want to assure you
[2:26] that at New Hope revival ministries we
[2:28] take your needs seriously we just feel
[2:32] extremely blessed that you have
[2:34] confidence in us enough that you would
[2:38] call and share sometimes you're a very
[2:41] personal request and I'm delighted that
[2:45] God has allowed us to have an
[2:47] opportunity to stand with you in faith
[2:49] today we are in part to our teaching
[2:54] today will be part two in the demonic
[2:58] doorways series the last time that we
[3:01] were together in this series there have
[3:04] been a couple of other programs with
[3:06] guests but when we were together for
[3:09] part 1
[3:11] we were talking about something that is
[3:14] I think somewhat controversial in the
[3:17] body of Christ and that is generational
[3:20] curses or generational cycles patterns
[3:25] that appear generationally in a family
[3:29] line we talked about some of the reasons
[3:32] why that we see these patterns repeating
[3:36] in families we understand that some of
[3:40] it is because of the influence the
[3:42] atmosphere that is built in one
[3:45] generation and that influences the next
[3:49] generation and therefore the tendencies
[3:52] to relieve stress or to forget it all
[3:57] whether it be with alcohol or drugs or
[4:01] illicit sexuality pornography whatever
[4:05] the means is it seems that what is
[4:08] patterned what the example is in one
[4:12] generation often becomes the habits of
[4:16] the next generation we also talked about
[4:19] the fact that you know Satan is sneaky
[4:23] and he is sly and I believe that he
[4:26] observes from from the outside he
[4:30] observes these kinds of atmospheres that
[4:33] are created and I believe that he even
[4:36] assigns demonic spirits to watch over
[4:41] the next generation and the next to set
[4:46] up circumstances and situations that
[4:49] would cause that next generation to have
[4:54] a predisposition a tendency to follow in
[4:59] the same path that their fathers and
[5:02] grandfathers followed in I'm concerned
[5:06] about the iniquity that is involved and
[5:11] in order to explain to you what I mean
[5:14] I'm going to have to go a little deeper
[5:16] in the scripture than what I had
[5:19] originally prepared to do
[5:22] when we were together the last time in
[5:24] fact I thought it might not even be
[5:26] necessary but I have spent some time in
[5:29] thought and I have spent some time in
[5:31] prayer and I think that it would be
[5:34] helpful for you and I to have a teaching
[5:38] a lesson together on the different words
[5:43] that are used in English from the Hebrew
[5:48] in the Old Testament that we sort of put
[5:53] in a big category the category of sin
[5:57] but the Bible talks about sin iniquity
[6:02] and transgression and I believe that it
[6:07] is iniquity that is easily carried over
[6:12] from one generation to the next I
[6:16] believe that we have a choice and the
[6:21] problem is that many people don't
[6:23] realize they have a choice and when that
[6:27] iniquity of the fathers begins to come
[6:30] and influence the next generation
[6:33] it just becomes the habit it becomes the
[6:37] normal Oh have mercy Lord what has
[6:41] become normal in our society today ways
[6:46] that people forget about it all so to
[6:49] speak and we talked about that when we
[6:52] were together last time you know even
[6:54] Christians who are not under the
[6:56] influence of a cycle of iniquity we
[7:00] still have stress we have anxiety we
[7:04] have situations that drive us to
[7:07] desperation but thanks be to God we have
[7:11] the Bible way we have the the God way to
[7:14] deal with these kinds of things and I'm
[7:18] not going to say that no Christian ever
[7:20] has the temptation to fall back into you
[7:24] know I'll just get drunk and forget
[7:26] about it all or I'll just go out and and
[7:28] party and forget about it all because
[7:30] the temptation may be there but the
[7:33] wonderful
[7:35] promise of the scripture is that to the
[7:38] believer with every temptation our God
[7:42] gives a way of escape and I generally
[7:47] find that the way to escape temptation
[7:50] is to bring our minds back to what is
[7:54] true what is virtuous what is holy what
[7:58] is pure and of course above it all that
[8:01] is the Word of God so we could never
[8:05] emphasize enough the importance or the
[8:09] value that we have found in the Word of
[8:13] God it is so valuable in every face of
[8:18] life and in every circumstance of life
[8:21] and I know that it may be too many it's
[8:26] just an antiquated book of stories but
[8:31] truly friend to the believer the Word of
[8:34] God is life the Word of God is both
[8:38] spirit and it is life and when we fall
[8:43] into that mode of being tempted and we
[8:48] have to rise up above it or else we
[8:50] would yield to it what value what power
[8:54] we can find by using the word of God to
[8:58] help us bring our focus to bring our
[9:02] thoughts back to what is good and what
[9:05] is right and what is holy and many
[9:07] people don't realize that what is
[9:10] happening in their life is a part of a
[9:13] cycle that's older than they are and I
[9:17] really believe that we can have a
[9:21] tremendous effect on that cycle I
[9:23] believe that once we understand that the
[9:26] enemy is setting up this generational
[9:29] trap that just continues to pass from
[9:33] generation to generation once we realize
[9:36] that we can discover there's a way to
[9:38] break that cycle thanks be to God
[9:41] there's a way to slam the door in the
[9:44] face of the demonic and say wait a
[9:46] minute
[9:48] trick is not going to work anymore
[9:50] because there's somebody on the inside
[9:53] of me who's leading me and guiding me
[9:56] the Bible tells us when he the Spirit of
[9:59] Truth has come he will lead us and guide
[10:02] us into all truth and once the Spirit of
[10:06] Truth has come he leads us to the tools
[10:10] to the strategies to the weapons if you
[10:13] will that we can use against the enemy
[10:17] and the Word of God becomes that
[10:20] crushing hammer that can destroy every
[10:24] generational cycle every generational
[10:28] curse if you will that the enemy tries
[10:33] to continue to use to propagate it from
[10:39] one generation to the next now let me
[10:42] let me take you to the scriptures here
[10:46] and understand that this might get
[10:49] slightly technical for a few moments but
[10:52] I believe it will be of great benefit to
[10:54] you if you will give it a listen and
[10:58] hear what the scripture is saying about
[11:03] these different words that are
[11:06] translated from the Hebrew to the
[11:08] English all under the umbrella of sin I
[11:13] think we should start in Exodus chapter
[11:16] 34 verse 6 and 7 and this is one of the
[11:20] verses or one of the portions that we
[11:23] used in in episode 1 and the Lord passed
[11:28] by before him and proclaimed the Lord
[11:32] the Lord God merciful and gracious
[11:35] long-suffering and abundant in goodness
[11:39] and in truth keeping mercy for thousands
[11:46] forgiving iniquity and transgression and
[11:50] sin and that will by no means clear the
[11:54] guilty visiting
[11:56] the iniquity of the father's upon the
[12:00] generation upon the children and upon
[12:05] the children's children unto the third
[12:08] and to the fourth generation let me read
[12:12] that verse again keeping mercy for
[12:14] thousands forgiving iniquity and
[12:17] transgression and sin and that will by
[12:22] no means clear the guilty visiting the
[12:25] iniquity of the father's upon the
[12:27] children and upon the children's
[12:29] children unto the third and the fourth
[12:32] generation now notice the scripture
[12:35] didn't say the sin would be visited and
[12:39] it didn't say that the that the
[12:41] transgression of the fathers would be
[12:45] visited but instead it says that the
[12:48] iniquity of the father's would be
[12:52] visited upon the children and upon the
[12:55] children's children even to the third
[12:57] and the fourth generation so we can tell
[13:01] by that one verse another example and I
[13:04] feel like it might help to know there
[13:06] more than one in Daniel chapter 9 verse
[13:09] 24 the scripture said seventy weeks are
[13:13] determined upon thy people and upon thy
[13:15] holy city to finish the transgression
[13:18] and to make an end of sins so we've got
[13:23] two already and to make reconciliation
[13:26] for iniquity there is the third and to
[13:31] bring in everlasting righteousness and
[13:34] to seal up the vision and prophecy and
[13:37] to anoint the most holy and this is
[13:41] another subject much bigger than we have
[13:44] time to to dig into today but this
[13:49] prophecy of Daniel and his seventy weeks
[13:52] is something that we can lay out over
[13:56] history from the time of the prophecy
[14:00] all the way up until the hour that we're
[14:02] living in right now and it will take us
[14:05] even to the very end of
[14:08] time as we know it this was a very
[14:10] powerful prophecy and in the in the
[14:14] introduction of Daniels prophecy we find
[14:17] all three English words that we have
[14:21] mentioned thus far both sin and
[14:25] transgression and iniquity all three and
[14:29] in the Hebrew these words though similar
[14:33] also have different and distinct
[14:37] meanings I think I want to to mention it
[14:41] that way because some people will say
[14:45] when they read the scripture over here
[14:49] in in Ezekiel they will say wait a
[14:53] minute
[14:54] I believe Izzi kiyul is saying there's
[14:56] nothing to this generational cycle or
[15:00] generational curse and they will often
[15:03] feel like the whole thing is
[15:05] disqualified in one chapter of the Bible
[15:09] one prophecy from Ezekiel even though
[15:11] it's mentioned in other places in the
[15:13] scripture and I think I want to just
[15:15] read this to you right now and then we
[15:18] will go back and talk about these three
[15:20] words sin transgression and iniquity in
[15:25] Ezekiel chapter 18 verses 1 through 4
[15:28] the word of the Lord came to me again
[15:31] saying what do you mean when you use the
[15:34] proverb concerning the land of Israel
[15:36] saying the fathers have eaten sour
[15:39] grapes and the children's teeth are set
[15:41] on edge as I live says the Lord God you
[15:45] shall no longer use this proverb in
[15:48] Israel behold all souls are mine the
[15:52] soul of the father as well as the soul
[15:55] of the son is mine so when some people
[15:59] hear that they say wait a minute then
[16:01] that that proverb is is cancelled but
[16:04] you see that doesn't do away with the
[16:06] scriptures that specifically say that
[16:09] the iniquity will be visited doesn't say
[16:12] the sin or the transgression it says the
[16:15] iniquity will be visited upon the 3rd
[16:18] and the 4th generation now if you take
[16:21] Ezekiel 18 I told you we'd get just a
[16:24] little bit technical here and you go
[16:27] down to verse 20 through 22
[16:29] let's get those read the soul that
[16:32] sinneth it shall die the son shall not
[16:35] bear the iniquity of the Father neither
[16:38] shall the father bear the iniquity of
[16:41] the son the righteousness of the
[16:44] righteous shall be upon him and the
[16:46] wickedness of the wicked shall be upon
[16:48] him but if the wicked will turn from all
[16:52] his sins that he hath committed and keep
[16:55] all my statutes and do that which is
[16:57] lawful and right he shall surely live he
[17:00] shall not die all his transgressions
[17:04] that he hath committed they shall not be
[17:06] mentioned unto him in his righteousness
[17:08] that he hath done he shall live in his
[17:13] righteousness that he hath done he shall
[17:16] live and in other words the prophet
[17:19] Ezekiel was dealing with a completely
[17:22] different situation altogether he found
[17:25] that the people were actually using the
[17:28] proverb and what they might have
[17:30] understood from the from the scripture
[17:32] as an excuse to to say well you know I I
[17:38] don't have a lot of choice here my
[17:40] father was involved in besan thus and
[17:43] thus and so it's very it's very common
[17:46] and expected that I should be involved
[17:49] in the same people were beginning to
[17:51] sort of use that as an excuse and I
[17:55] don't think that any of us would
[17:57] struggle too hard to imagine how easy
[18:00] that would be because I hear people
[18:02] doing it even today I hear people saying
[18:05] you know I could live a better life I
[18:08] could I could live a cleaner life or I
[18:10] could be closer to the Lord if my
[18:12] husband was a Christian or if I had a
[18:15] better job or if I had a better living
[18:18] circumstance you know and and so really
[18:22] using excuse some people say if I would
[18:25] have had a better upbringing I would be
[18:27] a better Christian today
[18:29] and so this is the kind of attitude that
[18:32] the prophet Ezekiel was dealing with
[18:35] don't you let these proverbs become
[18:37] excuses for not dealing with your own
[18:41] issue with your own sin your own
[18:44] iniquity and your own transgression
[18:47] Ezekiel did say you are not going to pay
[18:51] before God you're not going to answer
[18:54] before God for the transgression or for
[18:57] the iniquity of your father his his
[19:01] transgression his sin his iniquity he's
[19:04] going to answer for and at the end of
[19:07] your life you're going to answer for
[19:09] your your sin your transgression your
[19:11] iniquity and at the end of your
[19:13] children's life so I love the fact that
[19:17] we have such balance in the scripture
[19:20] and that's why we can't build an entire
[19:23] doctrine on one phrase of one verse of
[19:26] scripture book but what a picture we get
[19:29] when we take the time to pull all of
[19:33] these scriptures together and we begin
[19:35] to see something very beautiful in fact
[19:38] the prophet Ezekiel finishes up as we
[19:41] just read if by saying all his
[19:44] transgression that he had committed they
[19:46] shall not be mentioned unto him this is
[19:49] to the person who repents this is to the
[19:51] person who recognizes wait a minute I am
[19:54] responsible I'm not blaming my father I
[19:58] am responsible for my choices I am
[20:01] responsible for what I have chosen to do
[20:06] even though I knew that it was not good
[20:08] or it was not according to God's Word
[20:10] and once I repent of that then I'm not
[20:15] going to be held responsible even for my
[20:17] own sin my own transgression there's
[20:21] power in the blood of Jesus Christ
[20:24] there's power in coming to him with
[20:27] repentance and asking for him to take
[20:31] his precious life-giving blood and wash
[20:35] away your sin your transgression your
[20:38] iniquity and then you're free you're
[20:40] justified
[20:42] just if I'd never sinned it's completely
[20:46] wiped away of course we need the grace
[20:49] of God and the strength to obey so that
[20:53] we don't go and fall right back into the
[20:55] trap that we came out of but
[20:58] righteousness works the same way he said
[21:01] these things are not going to be
[21:03] mentioned to him again in his
[21:05] righteousness that he hath done shall he
[21:08] live so his lifestyle is transformed
[21:12] from one of of sin transgression and
[21:15] iniquity to a lifestyle of of doing what
[21:19] is right what is righteous and even when
[21:23] we try our hardest to do what is
[21:26] righteous the scripture tells us we will
[21:29] often fall short and that is why he
[21:32] gives us if we fellowship with him in
[21:35] faith if we obey His Word to the best of
[21:39] our strengths and ability he dresses us
[21:42] with the garments of salvation he
[21:44] clothes us with the robe of his
[21:47] righteousness and when he sees us he
[21:51] sees us through the blood of the Lamb
[21:53] and he sees the robe of righteousness
[21:56] that he has placed on our back and we
[22:00] stand upright and justified in the sight
[22:04] of God so it I don't think it's it's a
[22:07] good idea to take this Ezekiel and then
[22:11] disqualify all of the other things I've
[22:14] read some articles where where people
[22:16] have mentioned the other scriptures and
[22:19] then they say but of course it's all
[22:21] finished and cancelled and Ezekiel tells
[22:23] us there's nothing to it I don't think
[22:25] that is what Ezekiel was prophesying at
[22:28] all I think he was trying to bring the
[22:31] balance and tell the people you can no
[22:33] longer use your forefathers as an excuse
[22:37] to make the same dumb choices okay to
[22:40] make the same stupid decisions you've
[22:43] got to answer for yourselves and I think
[22:46] that's very good advice the other
[22:48] argument that sometimes Christians will
[22:51] bring up against this concept of
[22:54] generational curse
[22:55] or generational cycles or cycles of
[22:58] iniquity patterns of iniquity is they'll
[23:01] say well the blood of Jesus just
[23:03] canceled all of that and once you are a
[23:06] Christian then there's no more influence
[23:09] of of your forefathers and well that
[23:12] would be like saying that because you
[23:14] are a Christian the devil has no more
[23:16] influence over you and he can no longer
[23:18] make your way hard and he can no longer
[23:21] touch your circumstances and we know as
[23:24] Christians this is just not the same
[23:26] just not the truth we have the power we
[23:30] have the authority over the enemy but he
[23:33] is allowed by permission to make our way
[23:36] hard because God is using the enemy as a
[23:40] tool in his hand to bring his true
[23:43] children to their place of completion
[23:46] and perfection and when you begin to
[23:49] view your enemy that way as a tool in
[23:52] the hand of God then you spend less time
[23:55] focusing on what the enemy is doing and
[23:58] you spend more time focusing on the
[24:01] grace that God is extending to help you
[24:03] get out of the trap or the snare that
[24:06] Satan is setting for you so I think
[24:09] we've covered a couple of the of the big
[24:12] arguments and and I don't want to debate
[24:14] with anyone about whether this is true
[24:17] you could never change my mind I've
[24:20] lived long enough now that I have
[24:22] watched the enemy take advantage of the
[24:25] third and the fourth generation you know
[24:29] I'm 50 years old and I'm old enough now
[24:32] that I've seen the the same traps that
[24:36] tormented the great grandparents I've
[24:40] seen how that can absolutely pass down
[24:43] and become such a trap and such a trick
[24:46] and such a temptation and I know there's
[24:50] victory I know that we can absolutely
[24:53] crush the cycle and that's why I have
[24:58] chosen to to tackle a subject that can
[25:02] be controversial and and in some ways
[25:06] confusing but by the response
[25:09] that we've already received from episode
[25:12] 1 I believe there are more people out
[25:15] there who connect with this concept they
[25:18] may not be able to to ground it
[25:21] theologically they may not be able to
[25:24] you know to give us chapter and verse
[25:26] and use homiletics and hermeneutics to
[25:30] explain why it's happened in their life
[25:32] but but they're smart enough to know
[25:35] that that the enemy doesn't just go over
[25:38] in the corner and lay down and play dead
[25:40] and and he looks at a family and he says
[25:43] hey this worked for grandpa this is how
[25:45] I was able to ruin his life and
[25:49] sometimes grandpa died in ruin and so I
[25:54] think the enemy says you know I won't
[25:56] have to work so hard to go after the son
[25:58] it works so well with Grandpa I'll just
[26:02] I'll just go after the son with the same
[26:04] thing but what the enemy is not counting
[26:06] on is you hearing truth the enemy
[26:10] doesn't want you to hear truth because
[26:12] if you become equipped with the truth of
[26:15] God's Word you can say like we mentioned
[26:18] in the last broadcast you can say hey
[26:21] wait a minute
[26:22] no enough is enough it stops here and I
[26:27] believe that's why we're coming to you
[26:29] today again is to give you the strength
[26:34] the encouragement that you need to
[26:36] depend on the Lord I can't break this
[26:39] for you but I know the one who can and I
[26:42] can give you some simple tools and you
[26:45] know it's not a magic formula I've got
[26:48] to pray the right thing I've got to hold
[26:50] my mouth the right way while I'm praying
[26:52] I've gotta bow my head at the right
[26:54] angle and make sure that my fingertips
[26:56] touch let me tell you something that's
[26:59] religion and religion rather than
[27:02] helping you become free in truth
[27:05] religion will try to bind you and hold
[27:08] you back in the same cycles that you
[27:11] struggled with for years you just call
[27:13] on the Lord for mercy and if all you can
[27:15] get out is in the name of Jesus Christ
[27:18] by the blood of the Lamb I
[27:21] this cycle over my family and I start
[27:25] right here with this generation with my
[27:28] generation and I say this cannot go any
[27:32] farther to my children or my children's
[27:35] children and then equip your family if
[27:39] you can equip them to understand that
[27:42] the enemy is gonna try he's gonna be sly
[27:46] and he's gonna bring out the same tricks
[27:48] that he is used in your life but be
[27:51] transparent and let the Lord lead you to
[27:55] to help your children to help your
[27:57] grandchildren so that they don't have to
[28:00] suffer perhaps the way that you have
[28:01] suffered now I want to look at in the
[28:04] time that we have left I want to look at
[28:07] these words and see if we can get some
[28:10] definitions of the way these words are
[28:13] translated in the English that will help
[28:15] us I think every one of us know that sin
[28:19] is anything that comes short of the
[28:22] glory of God the Bible tells us in
[28:24] Romans 3:23 for all have sinned and have
[28:29] come short of the glory of God so
[28:31] anything in our lives that causes us to
[28:35] come short of the glory of God would
[28:39] could be defined biblically as sin we
[28:44] believe that the true sin
[28:46] the only real sin is unbelief and
[28:49] unbelief in every form will keep you an
[28:54] eye from reaching the mark of the glory
[28:58] of God
[28:59] we will fall short every time and this
[29:03] word appears in so many in so many
[29:06] places let me give you one more verse
[29:08] that talks about all three I want to do
[29:11] a good job here Leviticus 16 21 and
[29:14] Aaron shall lay both of his hands upon
[29:17] the head of the live goat and confess
[29:21] over him this this is speaking about
[29:23] that service that takes place in
[29:26] Tabernacles time where in in the fall
[29:31] feast where the
[29:34] the sins of the people are symbolically
[29:37] transferred onto the head of the
[29:39] scapegoat and he is driven into the
[29:42] wilderness notice the language here that
[29:45] Aaron shall lay both of his hands upon
[29:48] the head of the live goat and confess
[29:51] over him all the iniquities of the
[29:55] children of Israel and all their
[29:58] transgressions even all their sins
[30:02] there's all three words again and in my
[30:05] notes I referenced the fact that all
[30:08] three words have their own Hebrew number
[30:12] in Strong's Concordance meaning that
[30:15] although they are similar in the fact
[30:17] that they all cause us to come short of
[30:21] the glory of God
[30:22] iniquity is coming short of the glory of
[30:24] God transgression is coming short of the
[30:27] glory of God and so is sin but there's
[30:29] enough difference in those words in the
[30:32] original language that we can learn a
[30:34] little bit of a lesson so why don't we
[30:37] look at these scriptures and and kind of
[30:39] have this understanding that sin
[30:42] iniquity and transgression are similar
[30:46] but different in some way in fact I
[30:49] think it could be said that they all
[30:50] three represent increasing levels of
[30:54] falling short of the glory of God so
[30:58] maybe they even represent different
[31:01] levels of a falling short maybe one if
[31:05] we are caught up in one of the aspects
[31:07] one of those dimensions we might even we
[31:11] might even be in worse shape it might
[31:14] even be harder for us to break through
[31:17] but but remember this the blood of Jesus
[31:20] the blood of Jesus the sacrifice that he
[31:24] made for you and and really all you need
[31:26] is truth and that's the Word of God and
[31:29] you need the Spirit the Holy Spirit of
[31:32] God to lead you and how to use the truth
[31:34] and once the Spirit of God reveals to us
[31:37] how to use the truth I just want you to
[31:40] know there's not a curse there's not a
[31:41] cycle there is no sin iniquity
[31:44] transgression on and on and on there is
[31:47] noting that the blood of Jesus cannot
[31:51] take care of but we have to learn to use
[31:53] the blood to appropriate the blood we
[31:57] have to exercise the authority that we
[32:00] have been given to use the blood of
[32:03] Jesus Christ the Word of God as we
[32:06] talked to you many times and the
[32:08] precious name that God has given to us
[32:11] okay so sin is anything that comes short
[32:14] of the glory of God what you might
[32:17] remember about sin is that the Greek
[32:20] word that is translated to us in English
[32:22] in the New Testament as in a sin is
[32:26] actually a term for archery for drawing
[32:32] back the bow and releasing the arrow
[32:34] toward the target and so you may have
[32:37] heard the Greek definition that we have
[32:41] in the New Testament more often than
[32:43] than any Old Testament concept or Hebrew
[32:46] concept and that is the definition of
[32:49] New Testament of sin in the New
[32:51] Testament is missing the mark now I'm
[32:55] telling you I've missed the mark a time
[32:59] or two in fact it's possible to miss the
[33:02] mark in the course of every day of your
[33:05] life where you start out to accomplish
[33:08] something I'm gonna go all day long
[33:12] without letting my thoughts go in a
[33:14] certain direction I'm going to choose my
[33:16] words all day long to edify and glorify
[33:20] and build up you you may have other some
[33:23] other goal in mind but you just want to
[33:25] reflect the love and character of Jesus
[33:27] Christ and then you get in traffic and
[33:30] you lose your cool are you getting you
[33:33] get into a situation in a business on
[33:37] your job with your coworker and and
[33:39] you're just I mean I hope you're not
[33:42] going berserk but but you're just kind
[33:45] of falling short you realize hey wait a
[33:48] minute my emotions are going in a
[33:50] direction that I purpose they would not
[33:52] go in my thoughts are following and my
[33:55] words are coming pretty close
[33:57] you know things begin to come out of my
[34:00] my
[34:00] that I really didn't wanna I didn't want
[34:03] to speak death I really wanted to speak
[34:05] life and so even in the life of a
[34:08] believer that that very basic
[34:11] understanding of sin is something that
[34:13] we all deal with drawing back the bow
[34:18] aiming you know looking very close to
[34:22] try to to make sure that we sin the
[34:24] arrow right to the bull's eye but
[34:27] somewhere along the way that arrow can
[34:31] miss the target it can it can be a small
[34:35] defect in the in the arrow itself it can
[34:39] be in the in them in the way that you've
[34:41] drawn back maybe you you jerked a little
[34:45] bit at the last minute there's so many
[34:47] things I don't know all that much about
[34:49] archery but there are so many variables
[34:52] that could cause you to release the
[34:55] arrow thinking fully intending to send
[34:59] it to the bull's eye but somehow it gets
[35:01] out of the way it doesn't make it it
[35:04] misses the mark and this is this is a
[35:08] really good basic definition and
[35:11] understanding of the word sin slipping
[35:14] away from where you should be airing
[35:16] from the path on which God has put you
[35:18] not achieving a standard that God has
[35:21] set missing the mark or the path it's
[35:26] like a trail and and you know if if
[35:29] you're following the markings of a trail
[35:31] in the forest and it's easy to miss to
[35:35] miss one of the landmarks to miss one of
[35:38] the little signs and if you're not
[35:40] careful you may make some steps off of
[35:43] the trail and you could even find
[35:45] yourself in a dangerous situation
[35:46] because you missed the mark because you
[35:50] missed the marker and you stepped off
[35:53] the trail thanks be to God for the grace
[35:56] that he has given me in my life so many
[36:00] times hundreds of times thousands of
[36:03] times maybe tens of thousands of times
[36:06] hundreds of thousands of times when I
[36:09] missed a
[36:10] when I when I was not walking carefully
[36:13] looking carefully enough when I drew
[36:16] back the bow thinking that I was
[36:19] absolutely gonna nail the bullseye and
[36:22] somehow I missed a little bit and I say
[36:24] oh Jesus have mercy on me help me Lord
[36:27] to do better the next time and he does
[36:30] that's what it means to walk in
[36:33] relationship with God never taking
[36:35] advantage of grace this is not willfully
[36:39] sinning
[36:40] that's transgression that's another
[36:43] definition altogether it's another
[36:45] category all together but but setting
[36:49] out to do what is right and finding
[36:52] myself not quite making the target he
[36:55] has been so good and so faithful to me
[36:58] and I believe that every child of God
[37:00] watching this program could say hey man
[37:02] yes brothers Shelley he has been so good
[37:06] to me and so that Greek understanding of
[37:10] the word sin missing the mark or an act
[37:12] of disobedience to the Lord this this
[37:17] concept and this word sin is something
[37:21] that's not too deep seeded unless it is
[37:24] linked with an iniquity and we'll talk
[37:27] about that in a moment we could almost
[37:29] look at it as though sin is on top of
[37:33] the surface of the skin it's not
[37:35] something that goes deep down like
[37:38] iniquity and like a transgression one
[37:42] theological definition of the word sin
[37:45] the voluntary departure of a moral agent
[37:48] from a known rule of rectitude or duty
[37:52] prescribed by God any voluntary
[37:56] transgression of the divine law or
[37:58] violation of a divine command now the
[38:01] way that that definition reads it speaks
[38:05] more of them of making a conscious
[38:08] choice to sin and when you begin to do
[38:11] that when when missing the target
[38:14] becomes the norm when you are aware that
[38:19] you keep repeating this thing over and
[38:21] over again
[38:22] it becomes a willful choice then it
[38:25] takes you to another level and that
[38:28] would be of course the level of
[38:30] transgression sin is either an action in
[38:33] which a known or divine a known divine
[38:35] law is violated or it is the voluntary
[38:39] neglect to obey a positive divine
[38:41] command or a rule of duty clearly
[38:45] implied in such a command sin consists
[38:48] not of actions only but neglect of known
[38:52] Duty all evil thoughts purposes words
[38:55] desires whatever is contrary to God's
[38:58] commands are laws so we understand
[39:01] there's a difference in in sense of
[39:03] commission things that we do and there
[39:07] are sins of omission things that we
[39:10] neglect things that we fail to do there
[39:13] are sins of ignorance the Bible talks
[39:16] about it Leviticus 4 chapter chapter 4
[39:19] verse 13 begins to give an order of what
[39:23] we should do when someone has come who
[39:26] has sinned through ignorance and the
[39:29] thing be hid from the eyes of the
[39:31] Assembly and they have done somewhat
[39:33] against any of the commandments of the
[39:35] Lord
[39:35] Leviticus 4:2 if a soul shall sim
[39:38] through ignorance against any of the
[39:40] commandments so the Bible talks about a
[39:44] sin of ignorance not not even realizing
[39:46] what you're doing but the Bible also
[39:49] talks about doing it willfully and
[39:52] knowing full well what you're doing I
[39:54] want to talk about this word iniquity in
[39:57] in contrast or in comparison to the word
[40:02] sin because the scripture specifically
[40:05] mentions the word iniquity when it talks
[40:07] about that which is carried over from
[40:10] one generation to another and so the
[40:12] word iniquity in Hebrew is a word that
[40:16] means to bend or to twist or to distort
[40:20] so iniquities are a bending or a
[40:23] twisting or a distorting of the law or
[40:27] God's Word to different degrees all
[40:30] worthy of punishment of course Exodus 34
[40:34] 17
[40:35] mentions iniquity and guilt in the same
[40:38] sentence as God says he is forgiving
[40:41] iniquity and transgression and sin this
[40:45] word transgression is a word that means
[40:48] a willful act of disobedience it is a
[40:51] transgression done specifically to spite
[40:56] or in the face of God and I'm afraid
[40:59] that if if we don't deal with those
[41:03] cycles of iniquity
[41:05] then our sin becomes influenced our
[41:10] missing the mark becomes influenced by
[41:14] the iniquity of our forefathers and when
[41:18] we choose to go in that direction the
[41:22] direction that we are bent toward you
[41:26] see that's what these generational
[41:27] cycles and patterns and curses do is
[41:31] they cause the next generation to be
[41:34] distorted to be bent toward something as
[41:38] though that were the norm as though that
[41:40] were the right way and what we have to
[41:43] do is we have to believe that once we
[41:46] recognize how the enemy is working then
[41:49] we're making better choices it's not
[41:51] always easy but we have the grace of God
[41:54] to make better willful choices and
[41:58] especially when we can look back and see
[42:01] the destruction that alcoholism or the
[42:05] destruction that lust and pornography
[42:07] have had in in our family members lives
[42:11] that in itself gives us a little bit of
[42:15] strength to make a better choice but I'm
[42:18] telling you there's only one thing that
[42:20] will give us the total strength that we
[42:23] need to make better choices and that is
[42:25] to surrender to the truth of God's Word
[42:28] to be washed in the blood of Jesus
[42:31] Christ to be filled with the precious
[42:34] power of the Holy Ghost because the Holy
[42:36] Ghost comes to empower us to make better
[42:39] choices the Holy Ghost comes to to help
[42:43] us to recognize things like what we're
[42:45] talking about today so that we can
[42:48] make better choices another verse that
[42:52] mentions all three is psalm 32 and verse
[42:55] five I acknowledged my sin to you this
[42:59] is the psalmist in prayer I did not
[43:02] cover my iniquity I said I will confess
[43:05] my transgressions to the Lord and you
[43:09] forgave the iniquity of my sin
[43:13] the psalmist is saying I just laid it
[43:16] all out before the Lord
[43:17] I mentioned the Lord to the Lord my sin
[43:20] I acknowledged every time that I had
[43:24] missed the mark and I did not cover my
[43:27] iniquity I was confessing to the Lord
[43:30] the psalmist is saying the way that I
[43:32] had been bent the direction that I had
[43:36] been bent in that's what the iniquity is
[43:38] about and he said I confess my
[43:40] transgressions to the Lord the times the
[43:44] transgression is the times that I
[43:47] yielded to how I had been bent instead
[43:51] of allowing the grace of God to give me
[43:53] the strength to stand up rightly before
[43:56] him I have to be honest with you and
[43:59] tell you that in my Christian life I
[44:01] know there were times that I allowed
[44:04] myself I yielded myself to the way the
[44:08] enemy was trying to bend to me to the
[44:11] direction that he was trying to bend me
[44:13] thanks be to God when I began to
[44:15] recognize what was going on that I was
[44:18] beginning to make choices based on how I
[44:21] had been bent instead of choices based
[44:25] on the truth of God's Word I went before
[44:28] the Lord in full confession and in full
[44:30] disclosure you must never be afraid to
[44:34] come before the Lord your maker your
[44:37] Creator the lover of your soul and make
[44:40] full disclosure this is what the
[44:42] psalmist was saying I acknowledged my
[44:44] sin I did not cover my iniquity and I
[44:47] confess my transgressions to the Lord
[44:50] and you can always be assured that there
[44:53] is forgiveness of sin if you will walk
[44:56] in this truth that God is trying to make
[44:59] a real
[45:00] in your heart and in your life and it's
[45:03] a journey it's a journey you might you
[45:06] might say boy I really struggle well
[45:08] well here's the thing I've often heard
[45:10] this expression and I believe it's
[45:12] encouraging I may not be what I ought to
[45:16] be I may not yet be what I want to be
[45:20] but I can thank God that I am no longer
[45:23] what I used to be if that's the only
[45:26] testimony you can have today
[45:28] maybe you just are so discouraged with
[45:31] yourself because you keep yielding to
[45:34] the way the enemy has bent your life the
[45:39] circumstances again some of which have
[45:43] been visited on your generation by the
[45:46] iniquity of a prior generation
[45:49] especially the iniquity that was never
[45:53] confessed that was never dealt with sin
[45:56] and transgression that was never made
[45:59] right before God that that kind of sin
[46:02] that kind of iniquity and transgression
[46:04] has more potency and more power to
[46:09] affect the next generation and that's
[46:11] why you must recognize that you've got
[46:16] to be one of the ones who says enough is
[46:19] enough
[46:19] I can't afford to live the rest of my
[46:21] life yielding to the way the enemy has
[46:25] bent me the influences the
[46:30] predispositions can I say even the
[46:33] excuses that I've used because of my
[46:36] hard life there have been times and I'm
[46:40] saying myself to be transparent but I
[46:43] want you to know I'm speaking about you
[46:45] in your life as well because our
[46:47] circumstances are not all the same but I
[46:50] can tell you that even in my life I've
[46:52] been serving the Lord since I was a
[46:55] small child I received the baptism of
[46:58] the Holy Ghost when I was seven years
[46:59] old so the majority of my life has been
[47:02] a one of trying to please God and trying
[47:07] to walk in what was right but I I'm not
[47:09] going to pretend
[47:12] that I haven't failed to the Lord and
[47:14] and and he still loves me
[47:16] this is what's so wonderful he still
[47:19] loves me and he has given me the
[47:21] strength and I can say that I'm a whole
[47:23] lot closer to where I want to be then I
[47:26] used to be but I'm not where I want to
[47:29] be I know there is more the more I yield
[47:32] myself to him the more I come into that
[47:35] place of Union and intimacy relationship
[47:39] with them I know there's more of God
[47:41] that needs to be expressed in my life
[47:44] but I'm on the journey and I encourage
[47:48] you to stay the course I encourage you
[47:51] that when you become aware of the fact
[47:53] that you just made a quick decision not
[47:56] based on the Word of God not based on
[47:59] what is right but based on what is
[48:02] convenient because of the way you've
[48:06] been bent the way you've been influenced
[48:10] there's a lot of this that is being
[48:13] proven today scientifically to be
[48:17] genetic code to have to have the
[48:23] circumstances of a prior generation and
[48:26] what they have yielded to to be written
[48:30] in genetic code to affect your DNA this
[48:34] is now becoming you know you know for
[48:37] many years we were told by science that
[48:42] we would live our whole life with the
[48:45] brain that we were born with and with
[48:47] the genetic code in DNA that we were
[48:49] born with but we're now learning
[48:52] scientifically what the Bible has said
[48:55] all along there is no part of you that
[48:57] can't be transformed by the precious
[49:00] blood of Jesus Christ even your DNA can
[49:03] be healed even your genetic code can be
[49:06] rewritten by the blood of Jesus Christ
[49:09] even the the desires that you have that
[49:13] you don't want to have God can replace
[49:16] those by feeding on His Word and
[49:20] learning to use his word as your weapon
[49:22] you can absolutely
[49:24] mold yourself bend yourself by grace
[49:28] with his help believe me I know it's not
[49:31] something we do by ourselves but we can
[49:33] bend ourselves right right back straight
[49:35] just like the Word of God says we do
[49:38] that by his gift by His grace by asking
[49:43] him by pleading with him and when I say
[49:46] pleading I don't mean begging
[49:48] I mean petitioning him faithfully Lord I
[49:51] believe your word and I believe you can
[49:53] deal with every bit of what the enemy is
[49:57] trying to do I've watched how some of
[50:00] this stuff can work how perversion this
[50:05] is now becoming a scientific fact that
[50:09] perversion in one generation can
[50:12] absolutely bend change the DNA the RNA
[50:17] structure of the flesh it can affect the
[50:21] beliefs in the attitudes it can make
[50:24] genetic changes that are passed down
[50:27] from generation to generation so there's
[50:31] only one solution to remedy that to
[50:34] bring that back into God's order and
[50:35] that's by what we've been talking about
[50:38] by going God's Way we there is so much
[50:42] research now that says things like high
[50:44] blood pressure
[50:45] alcoholism sexual perversions jealousy
[50:48] anger fear are passed down from
[50:51] generation to generation racism greed
[50:54] even idolatry have having a tendency to
[50:58] run in families
[51:00] why because this is a trap that the
[51:04] enemy wants to put your family in but
[51:06] there's victory it signifies not merely
[51:10] that which is wrong when we talk about a
[51:12] generational cycle or a generational
[51:14] curse we're not just talking about
[51:16] something that is wrong but the tendency
[51:18] to do wrong even the tendency the
[51:22] preference to do wrong a predisposition
[51:25] to do wrong it's easily passed down a
[51:30] perversion of truth can affect our
[51:35] intent our will it can affect Oh
[51:38] a lot of things about who we are in our
[51:41] life and that's why we need to break
[51:44] that cord of iniquity that the enemy
[51:47] would try to bind us with he wants to
[51:49] bind you with the past he wants to keep
[51:51] you walking on the same road that others
[51:53] have walked before you oh no there's
[51:56] another way there's a highway there's
[51:58] the King's way and I believe God is
[52:00] giving victory I believe there are many
[52:02] of you that are about to take your
[52:04] future into your hand in the name of
[52:07] Jesus I'm not talking about humanism I'm
[52:11] not talking about the power of positive
[52:13] thinking I'm talking about waking up one
[52:16] day and realizing I don't have to lay
[52:18] down and play dead while the devil
[52:21] destroys my home my family my children
[52:23] my grandchildren I can stand up and take
[52:26] authority over the enemy the Bible talks
[52:30] about so many scriptures here that we
[52:32] won't be able to get to in the time that
[52:34] we have left but we'll have one more
[52:36] lesson on this and we'll start bringing
[52:38] some clarity I hope and I want to talk
[52:41] to you about the opposite you know if
[52:45] the enemy can influence our generations
[52:49] with iniquity with with thought
[52:53] processes and ideas perversions and
[52:57] addictions I find that whatever the
[53:00] enemy perverts there there's a great
[53:02] truth in there somewhere that can be a
[53:04] great blessing and a great benefit and I
[53:07] found many references in scripture to
[53:10] what we could call the generational
[53:12] blessing if there can be a generational
[53:14] curse there can be a generational
[53:17] blessing and we have rights to claim
[53:19] that and maybe you don't have any any
[53:22] you know your your elders your ancestors
[53:25] maybe they didn't serve the Lord maybe
[53:27] you're the first generation Christian in
[53:30] your life well then you say brother
[53:32] Shelly how is how is a generational
[53:34] blessing going to affect me I'll tell
[53:36] you what it can affect you by affecting
[53:39] your children by you saying wait a
[53:41] minute I've turned this thing around by
[53:44] the truth of God's Word and I'm calling
[53:47] for my children and my grandchildren to
[53:50] begin to be
[53:51] blessed to receive the benefit of my
[53:54] obedience to the Lord we have every
[53:57] right to claim our loved ones to present
[54:00] them before the Lord and say Lord as you
[54:04] have done for me I believe you to do the
[54:07] same for my children and grandchildren
[54:09] does that take away their free will does
[54:13] that mean they don't have a choice does
[54:15] that mean this becomes automatic it
[54:17] doesn't mean any of that but what it
[54:19] does mean is that the favor of the Lord
[54:22] through your obedience can release an
[54:26] atmosphere over their life that they
[54:29] can't get away they cannot get away from
[54:32] the truth that there is a way out of sin
[54:37] and transgression and iniquity we can we
[54:41] can start making a difference even by
[54:43] the words that we speak I'm absolutely
[54:47] 100% sure of that I think we'll pray our
[54:52] time is gone and when we meet again
[54:55] we'll bring some of this together I'm
[54:58] even going to to make a longer list with
[55:01] you of certain things that we have
[55:04] noticed through the years travel easily
[55:07] through generations and there
[55:10] therefore if you recognize some of that
[55:13] in your own family line you would I
[55:16] would encourage you and hope that you
[55:19] would bring that before the Lord maybe
[55:21] everything on the list if necessary and
[55:24] say O God I repent for my generation for
[55:27] myself or my for my influence over my
[55:30] family I repent and I believe that you
[55:34] will give grace and favor and
[55:37] deliverance that I can be free and so
[55:41] that I can help the next generation and
[55:44] the next generation to be free Lord
[55:46] knows we need somebody to stand up for
[55:50] truth your family needs somebody your
[55:53] nation needs somebody to stand up for
[55:56] truth father where would we be Lord
[55:58] without your word and without your help
[56:01] o God we would be lost and we would
[56:04] care and we wouldn't even know it we
[56:06] would be on our way to a devil's hell
[56:08] but we want to thank you today for the
[56:11] truth of the gospel the good news of
[56:13] Jesus Christ we want to thank you today
[56:16] that it is the power of God unto
[56:19] salvation and we want to thank you that
[56:22] you have given us a remedy a cure for
[56:25] sin transgression and iniquity lord I
[56:28] thank you right now for for this this
[56:31] attitude that that I believe is gripping
[56:34] people's hearts to be proactive to come
[56:37] before you and begin to lay these things
[56:40] out before you by saying no father I
[56:43] repent for my own for my own influence
[56:45] over my family and I intend to do
[56:49] everything I know to do to break that
[56:50] cycle that it would not be passed down
[56:53] to my children and grandchildren we want
[56:55] to see freedom we want to see household
[56:57] salvation and you promised in your word
[57:00] that we could believe on the Lord Jesus
[57:03] Christ and be saved and our house it was
[57:06] given to the jailer this promise we
[57:08] reach up and take a hold of that because
[57:11] we also believe Lord that you love us
[57:14] and it is your desire to help our family
[57:17] members Lord I pray for a stirring for a
[57:20] revival in families that are represented
