[1:00:23] i heard it last night on the broadcast
[1:00:25] and it really touched me
[1:00:34] it's a blessing when i see the dark
[1:00:37] clouds partying
[1:00:40] when the rain is gone and sun is
[1:00:43] breaking through
[1:00:47] i anticipate when life will just be
[1:00:51] normal
[1:00:54] just to close my weary eyes and rest in
[1:00:58] you
[1:01:01] my heart can rest so easy when they're
[1:01:04] blue skies
[1:01:07] when the rain is gone and wind is not
[1:01:11] inside
[1:01:14] how i long to hang my sword above the
[1:01:17] mantle
[1:01:20] away from harm and distant from the
[1:01:24] fight
[1:01:27] but i wouldn't know your peace without
[1:01:31] the hard times
[1:01:34] or be thankful for relief without
[1:01:38] the pain
[1:01:40] i wouldn't love the light if it were not
[1:01:44] for darkness
[1:01:47] or appreciate the sun without the rain
[1:01:52] [Music]
[1:01:54] how could i understand forgiveness
[1:01:57] without failure
[1:01:58] [Music]
[1:02:00] or feel the warmth of love without the
[1:02:03] bitter goal
[1:02:07] how could i hold your healing hands
[1:02:10] without affliction
[1:02:14] and be blessed to see your
[1:02:18] mercies sure it's a blessing to be safe
[1:02:23] secure and warm
[1:02:27] but lord i want to thank you for the
[1:02:31] storm
[1:02:35] imagine as peter said in prison
[1:02:41] he may have paced the floor with chains
[1:02:44] around his feet
[1:02:48] in his mind the devil taunted
[1:02:51] and whispered
[1:02:54] the battle's lost and this is your
[1:02:57] defeat
[1:03:00] but then his mind went back to that
[1:03:03] night in the tempest
[1:03:07] when the master spoken winds and seas
[1:03:11] obeyed
[1:03:14] and he remembered that storm combing all
[1:03:17] around him
[1:03:20] so he could rest in that dark praise
[1:03:25] [Music]
[1:03:27] and say i wouldn't know your peace
[1:03:30] without the hard times
[1:03:34] or be thankful for relief
[1:03:37] without the pain
[1:03:40] i wouldn't love the light if it
[1:03:43] [Music]
[1:03:47] or appreciate the sun without the rain
[1:03:53] how could i understand forgiveness
[1:03:56] without failure
[1:04:00] or feel the warmth of love without the
[1:04:03] bitter cold
[1:04:06] how could i hold your healing hands
[1:04:09] without affliction
[1:04:13] and be blessed to see your mercies all
[1:04:16] unfold
[1:04:19] sure it's a blessing
[1:04:21] to be safe secure and warm
[1:04:27] lord i wanna thank you for the storm

[1:11:21] spot but it's the right mountain
[1:11:23] it's on mount zion it's in the right
[1:11:25] city it's in jerusalem it's in the right
[1:11:28] land the land of the bible
[1:11:30] and oh what a feeling

[1:15:14] i i
[1:15:15] i'm not insulted
[1:15:17] but i don't but i did today
[1:15:24] [Music]
[1:15:26] i wrote this song a holy spirit wrote
[1:15:28] this song
[1:15:29] many moons ago
[1:15:32] i was
[1:15:33] standing on
[1:15:36] a mountain
[1:15:39] looking
[1:15:41] toward
[1:15:42] the sky
[1:15:43] [Music]
[1:15:45] when i saw
[1:15:47] a storm approaching
[1:15:51] and i feared
[1:15:53] that i would die
[1:15:58] i saw god's creatures
[1:16:01] run and seek
[1:16:04] a better
[1:16:06] place to hide
[1:16:09] [Music]
[1:16:10] but up above put the thunder roll
[1:16:14] down in my soul forgive me
[1:16:17] then i
[1:16:18] bow
[1:16:20] my head
[1:16:23] and cried
[1:16:30] now the clouds
[1:16:32] were moving
[1:16:34] faster
[1:16:37] and the lightning was
[1:16:39] flashing bright
[1:16:42] [Music]
[1:16:43] and the
[1:16:44] sun's so dark they hit the light of the
[1:16:49] sun
[1:16:50] and it seemed
[1:16:52] that it was not
[1:16:56] all but all at once there was a feeling
[1:17:03] like i'd never
[1:17:05] had before
[1:17:09] up above the storm
[1:17:12] you should have heard me sing god had
[1:17:17] given me
[1:17:20] eagles

[1:21:11] the song years ago it's been a long time
[1:21:13] now but they wanted me to change the
[1:21:16] line about
[1:21:17] being in the barnyard
[1:21:20] they didn't know the story but they
[1:21:22] didn't know where i had been
[1:21:24] i said no if you can't do it like the
[1:21:26] holy spirit wrote it then you can't have
[1:21:28] it
[1:21:29] but those of us who spent some time in

[1:22:03] more in it you know
[1:22:05] you're just holding back
[1:22:10] he just holds back
[1:22:12] he's usually a sweaty mess when he's
[1:22:14] done
[1:22:18] yeah that's right
[1:22:19] acts chapter 1.
[1:22:25] first 11 verses we're teaching this
[1:22:27] morning preaching too
[1:22:29] and we need your help
[1:22:32] we want you to know if you're here and
[1:22:33] this is not your
[1:22:35] normal church or average church or place
[1:22:38] where you usually are
[1:22:41] we're not in a hurry
[1:22:43] and we understand you might be
[1:22:47] you may have other obligations we don't
[1:22:49] make any other obligations on sunday but
[1:22:52] you may and if you do and you need to
[1:22:54] slip out
[1:22:55] at any time you feel free and we won't
[1:22:57] talk bad about you we will understand
[1:23:01] but we won't rush for you
[1:23:03] i just need to let you know that too
[1:23:05] because we only have one service on
[1:23:07] sunday and we make it count
[1:23:10] amen so i that's not to be offensive
[1:23:13] it's just to let you know that we know
[1:23:15] that sometime you must slip out and
[1:23:17] please do we understand completely but
[1:23:19] we want to be here till we're done
[1:23:22] amen
[1:23:23] this is it means something to us and
[1:23:26] we could uh we don't have but two
[1:23:29] services a week and
[1:23:31] we're together a lot more than that but
[1:23:33] we want to make it count
[1:23:35] verse 1
[1:23:36] acts chapter 1
[1:23:38] the former treatise have i made all
[1:23:41] theophilus
[1:23:42] of all that jesus began
[1:23:45] both to do
[1:23:47] and teach
[1:23:49] until the day in which he was taken up
[1:23:53] after that he through the holy ghost had
[1:23:56] given commandments unto the people whom
[1:24:00] he had chosen
[1:24:04] to whom also he showed himself after his
[1:24:07] passion
[1:24:08] by many infallible proofs
[1:24:11] being seen of them forty days
[1:24:15] and speaking of the things pertaining to
[1:24:19] the kingdom of god
[1:24:21] perhaps you already know that 40 days
[1:24:24] after the resurrection of our lord he
[1:24:26] remained in the earth
[1:24:28] speaking the kingdom to those who were
[1:24:30] with him
[1:24:31] that the bible said here to them that he
[1:24:33] had chosen
[1:24:35] he wasn't looking for the big crowds in
[1:24:37] those 40 days
[1:24:39] he wasn't doing evangelistic work in
[1:24:42] those 40 days
[1:24:43] those 40 days were reserved for those
[1:24:46] that he had chosen to hear those things
[1:24:50] pertaining to the kingdom now god is
[1:24:52] still making choices like that today
[1:24:56] whether we want to realize it or not
[1:24:59] i know that the church likes to
[1:25:00] emphasize whosoever will and i believe
[1:25:03] that with all my heart but i also
[1:25:05] believe that there is a people being
[1:25:07] prepared of the lord around the world
[1:25:09] today
[1:25:10] to hear the special things of the
[1:25:12] kingdom
[1:25:13] i remember bobby connor being here some
[1:25:15] years ago and saying that that god
[1:25:17] shouts
[1:25:20] his truths
[1:25:22] but he whispers his secrets
[1:25:24] amen and you know if you're waiting for
[1:25:26] the shout
[1:25:27] you might you might get it you might get
[1:25:29] the loud but you may miss that that love
[1:25:32] secret that he wants to share with those
[1:25:34] that he's chosen to overcome in laodicea
[1:25:38] to the church write these things
[1:25:40] and to them who overcome right these
[1:25:42] things i want to be one of those that
[1:25:44] overcomes
[1:25:46] i want to overcome the spirit of the age
[1:25:48] that i'm living in and manifest christ
[1:25:50] to a world that needs him more than they
[1:25:53] realize
[1:25:54] to whom also he showed himself alive
[1:25:57] after his passion by many infallible
[1:25:59] proofs being seen of them forty days and
[1:26:02] speaking of the things pertaining to the
[1:26:05] kingdom of god and being assembled
[1:26:08] together with them commanded them that
[1:26:10] they should not depart from jerusalem
[1:26:14] sounds like it was more than a
[1:26:15] suggestion
[1:26:17] but wait for the promise of the father
[1:26:20] which saith he ye have heard of me
[1:26:24] for john truly baptized with water
[1:26:28] but ye shall be baptized with the holy
[1:26:32] ghost
[1:26:33] not many days hence
[1:26:36] when they therefore were come together
[1:26:39] they asked of him saying lord wilt thou
[1:26:42] at this time restore again the kingdom
[1:26:46] to israel
[1:26:48] now even among the chosen
[1:26:51] there were those who were of a political
[1:26:55] mindset
[1:26:57] they were still seeing the messiah as a
[1:27:00] political answer to their problem
[1:27:03] to end the occupation of rome
[1:27:05] they were not seeing the full picture of
[1:27:08] why he had really come to the house of
[1:27:11] israel let's let's read on
[1:27:14] and he said unto them it is not for you
[1:27:16] to know the times or the seasons
[1:27:19] which the father hath put in his own
[1:27:22] power
[1:27:24] i want to make sure you understand it
[1:27:25] was not for them to know
[1:27:29] it's not for them to know
[1:27:30] they weren't living in the last days
[1:27:33] you and i are living in the last days
[1:27:36] to us it has been granted the blessing
[1:27:38] of knowing times and seasons
[1:27:40] under the anointing of the sons of
[1:27:42] issachar we must know the times and
[1:27:45] seasons of the lord we must know the
[1:27:48] ebbs and flows of what he's doing in the
[1:27:50] earth and he said unto them not for you
[1:27:52] to know the times or the seasons which
[1:27:54] the father hath put in his own power
[1:27:57] verse 8 but ye shall receive power
[1:28:01] you just be concerned about power you
[1:28:04] need it
[1:28:06] ye shall receive power
[1:28:08] after that the holy ghost is come upon
[1:28:12] you and ye shall be witnesses unto me
[1:28:14] both in jerusalem and in all judea and
[1:28:17] in samaria and under the uttermost part
[1:28:20] of the earth this was a time when people
[1:28:22] were hiding their faith
[1:28:24] they were afraid of the romans
[1:28:27] and though their devotion was something
[1:28:29] they were they were putting in the
[1:28:30] closet and hiding under the table
[1:28:33] but now the holy ghost is coming jesus
[1:28:36] said and you're going to have power
[1:28:39] you're going to have courage you're
[1:28:41] going to have boldness
[1:28:43] to be witnesses of what i'm doing
[1:28:45] and when he had spoken these things
[1:28:47] while they beheld he was taken up
[1:28:50] and a cloud received him out of their
[1:28:54] sight and while they looked steadfastly
[1:28:58] toward heaven as he went up behold two
[1:29:01] men stood by them in white apparel
[1:29:05] why which also said ye men of galilee
[1:29:09] why stand ye gazing up
[1:29:12] into heaven
[1:29:14] i love this
[1:29:16] this
[1:29:18] help me
[1:29:19] same jesus
[1:29:22] not another
[1:29:24] same one
[1:29:26] this same jesus which is taken up from
[1:29:29] you into heaven shall so come in like
[1:29:32] manner
[1:29:34] with a cloud
[1:29:36] in like manner as ye have seen him go
[1:29:40] into heaven now let's pray just a minute
[1:29:43] father
[1:29:44] we thank you that you are
[1:29:46] god's sovereign
[1:29:48] you are god's supreme
[1:29:50] and you are lord over every situation
[1:29:54] we're not gathered here today to be seen
[1:29:57] we are gathered here to learn of you
[1:30:00] we've enjoyed the atmosphere that has
[1:30:02] been created by the worship
[1:30:05] we thank you for coming we thank you for
[1:30:08] moving among us
[1:30:09] there were a few moments during that
[1:30:11] worship where we could feel things
[1:30:13] shifting above our heads
[1:30:15] lord we thank you for that
[1:30:17] we thank you that we don't have to
[1:30:19] settle for oppression
[1:30:21] we don't have to settle for depression
[1:30:24] we can have open heavens over our lives
[1:30:27] we're learning how to open them and to
[1:30:30] keep them open as we enter into the
[1:30:33] sincerest part of praise and worship
[1:30:37] now lord we approach the reason why
[1:30:39] we're here we're here to learn of your
[1:30:42] word
[1:30:43] we're here to be challenged and
[1:30:44] quickened and changed by the living
[1:30:47] truth that it contains there's one thing
[1:30:49] we recognize now lord after all these
[1:30:52] years satan is also among us
[1:30:55] he comes because he opposes the delivery
[1:30:58] of the word of god he doesn't oppose the
[1:31:01] quoting of the word but if the living
[1:31:03] word should come and stand among us
[1:31:06] today and teach us by the anointing of
[1:31:09] the holy ghost then that enemy would do
[1:31:11] everything within his power to hinder
[1:31:14] that moment
[1:31:15] but we just serve notice to all enemies
[1:31:18] that our god is powerful
[1:31:21] and that he has filled us with holy
[1:31:24] ghost and with fire
[1:31:26] and we are here to learn of him
[1:31:29] so lord we ask right now that you would
[1:31:31] cause us to have an unction of alertness
[1:31:34] and that we would everyone exercise the
[1:31:38] faith that has been given to us that we
[1:31:40] might be able to exercise the gift that
[1:31:43] you have placed in this house for this
[1:31:45] moment now lord you've used the other
[1:31:47] gifts i've seen you using the musicians
[1:31:50] and the worship leaders and those who
[1:31:52] run the equipment and all the different
[1:31:54] parts of this service and now lord i ask
[1:31:57] you to use the gift that you have placed
[1:31:59] for this part and we'll give you glory
[1:32:01] and honor and praise for it's in the
[1:32:04] mighty name of our messiah yeshua the
[1:32:06] lord jesus christ we pray and the church
[1:32:09] said
[1:32:11] amen
[1:32:13] amen
[1:32:14] you may be seated
[1:32:16] so the church world uh
[1:32:18] calls this
[1:32:20] pentecost
[1:32:22] sunday
[1:32:23] that's all right i'm for that
[1:32:26] penti is a greek
[1:32:28] word
[1:32:29] penti is a greek prefix for 50.
[1:32:33] we've been preaching on jubilee
[1:32:36] we've been talking about
[1:32:38] that
[1:32:39] total deliverance
[1:32:40] requires a complete separation from all
[1:32:45] unbelief are you with me
[1:32:47] and many are going back over that series
[1:32:50] because they have come to the
[1:32:52] understanding that they need total
[1:32:54] deliverance
[1:32:56] still some things hanging on in the
[1:32:59] realm of the soul
[1:33:00] in the mind and in the will and the
[1:33:02] emotions we're still dealing with some
[1:33:04] junk
[1:33:05] it's all right
[1:33:07] you don't have to be ashamed of that you
[1:33:09] were going to be ashamed you'd only be
[1:33:11] ashamed of the fact that you didn't care
[1:33:13] what was still hanging on to you but
[1:33:16] thank god you care
[1:33:18] and thank god you keep pulling yourself
[1:33:20] into his presence
[1:33:22] so that he can massage your heart with
[1:33:25] his fingers
[1:33:27] and accomplish what he wants to
[1:33:29] accomplish in your life
[1:33:31] i tell you it's a wonderful thing to be
[1:33:33] in the hands of a living god
[1:33:35] it's only fearful to those who won't
[1:33:37] allow him to purify them first but to
[1:33:39] those who understand that it is not my
[1:33:42] righteousness that i stand here with
[1:33:44] today
[1:33:46] i can do all the church entity right and
[1:33:49] still not be righteous
[1:33:51] oh i can dress right live right talk
[1:33:53] right walk right sing right spit white
[1:34:00] i'm old i've heard them say it all you
[1:34:02] know
[1:34:03] they used to say i'm my mom i'll do this
[1:34:06] right and still
[1:34:07] all my tables would be full of vomit
[1:34:12] when i compare what i would be able to
[1:34:14] accomplish without him
[1:34:16] with his righteousness but i stand here
[1:34:18] today dress in a righteousness that is
[1:34:21] not of my own
[1:34:22] i've done absolutely nothing to qualify
[1:34:25] for it except to say yes
[1:34:28] that is our responsibility in this hour
[1:34:31] to keep putting ourselves under the
[1:34:33] unction
[1:34:34] to keep drawing up under the spout where
[1:34:37] the goodness and the glories of god run
[1:34:39] out that's what we need to do and you
[1:34:41] don't have to be in church to do that
[1:34:44] you can worship god on the way
[1:34:47] you can worship god in your home and in
[1:34:49] your yard and your garden and wherever
[1:34:51] you are you need to create a sanctuary
[1:34:55] wherever you are because we're living in
[1:34:56] the last days and the wilds of the enemy
[1:35:00] are all around us and that old hypocrite
[1:35:02] lion is always roaring he's an imposter
[1:35:06] he's an imitation he desires to mimic
[1:35:10] and mock the lion of the tribe of judah
[1:35:13] he's not a lion but as a roaring lion he
[1:35:16] walks about seeking whom he can pluck
[1:35:18] out
[1:35:19] and pick off he's not only out in the
[1:35:21] world doing that are you with me
[1:35:24] he's right in here among the saints of
[1:35:26] god looking for those who remain weak
[1:35:29] for those who let a little heart of
[1:35:31] criticism get in them
[1:35:33] how many of you remember a warning that
[1:35:35] the holy spirit gave us not too many
[1:35:38] weeks ago he said guard your heart
[1:35:42] against any and all offense
[1:35:46] did you know a fence is taking people
[1:35:48] out of the fight
[1:35:52] the enemy he's just watching
[1:35:56] he's just watching people drop off
[1:35:59] in this hour because they get offended
[1:36:01] so easily
[1:36:02] great peace have they psalm 119 verse
[1:36:05] 165 great peace have they which love thy
[1:36:08] law thy instruction and nothing shall
[1:36:11] offend them
[1:36:12] and if you looked at that in hebrew it
[1:36:14] would say nothing shall be a stumbling
[1:36:16] block to them because they refuse to
[1:36:18] stumble
[1:36:21] how many of you know the commercial that
[1:36:23] goes around i've fallen and i can't get
[1:36:25] up that's not for the bride
[1:36:27] the bride falls she fails sister anna's
[1:36:30] sung about it we make mistakes
[1:36:33] but the bride just gets up and says lord
[1:36:36] have mercy on me i can't quit now i'm
[1:36:40] too close to being in his image
[1:36:43] i'm too close to being transformed in
[1:36:46] his character and in his likeness when i
[1:36:49] fall i must get up i have to
[1:36:53] i i wasn't created to
[1:36:55] you know tap around peck around here in
[1:36:58] the valley
[1:36:59] glory
[1:37:01] you know the the farmer found an egg
[1:37:04] he did he found an egg he didn't know
[1:37:06] where it belonged
[1:37:07] so all he knew to do with that egg was
[1:37:09] to take it to the barnyard
[1:37:11] and put it under a hen
[1:37:14] and mama did her part
[1:37:16] and she hatched them all
[1:37:18] hers and somebody else's
[1:37:20] amen
[1:37:22] and i was that i was that one the farmer
[1:37:24] found i hope you realize you were the
[1:37:26] one the farmer found you didn't belong
[1:37:28] under that hen
[1:37:30] you weren't going to hatch out a biddy
[1:37:33] i know some eagles that can short never
[1:37:35] mind
[1:37:41] i know some clucking eagles
[1:37:43] it's time for you to rise up and
[1:37:45] manifest who you really are
[1:37:47] amen
[1:37:49] oh i looked around and i thought mine
[1:37:51] looked a little different than the rest
[1:37:53] of these folks yeah how did i get here
[1:37:56] well i might as well make the best of it
[1:37:58] i guess i'm the ugly duckling anybody
[1:38:00] ever felt like that i guess i'm the ugly
[1:38:03] duckling in the church
[1:38:05] because what thrills them don't seem to
[1:38:07] thrill me and what thrills me doesn't
[1:38:09] seem to thrill them but but here's where
[1:38:11] mama put me
[1:38:13] so so i i guess i'll just have to be
[1:38:15] what i am and do the best i can in all
[1:38:18] those grubs
[1:38:21] those worms
[1:38:23] those denominational systems that they
[1:38:26] tried to feed me by
[1:38:28] oh it tasted so awful to me
[1:38:31] but i didn't want to starve to death so
[1:38:32] i ate what my brothers and sisters were
[1:38:34] eating
[1:38:37] seemed to sustain them and strengthen
[1:38:39] them so i got some nourishment from it
[1:38:41] because even in all that the spirit
[1:38:43] would fall
[1:38:44] come on
[1:38:46] and then one day i i
[1:38:49] i got to flapping my wings around and
[1:38:51] realized that i could get a little
[1:38:53] higher than the rest of my brothers and
[1:38:55] sisters
[1:38:59] and there they stood looking up at me
[1:39:01] show off
[1:39:05] show off
[1:39:07] trying to be spiritual
[1:39:11] emotionalism
[1:39:14] but i like the feeling
[1:39:16] when the wind would get under my wings
[1:39:18] and lift me up a little bit i like the
[1:39:20] feeling
[1:39:22] and one day i flapped them enough and
[1:39:23] found myself on the top of the fence
[1:39:25] post
[1:39:27] and i'm looking down in the barnyard
[1:39:29] and from there i really realized i
[1:39:32] didn't belong down there nothing wrong
[1:39:34] with those fine feathered friends
[1:39:37] but i just wasn't one of them
[1:39:40] no criticism for them they're doing
[1:39:42] exactly what they were born to do
[1:39:46] judas did exactly oh watch you get quiet
[1:39:49] now judas did exactly what he was born
[1:39:51] to do the bible said so
[1:39:54] i didn't make that up
[1:39:58] the bible said born the son of perdition
[1:40:04] an unbeliever from the beginning
[1:40:07] where in the close of a mate believer
[1:40:10] oh but i heard a prophet say when it
[1:40:12] come time to go up to the upper room
[1:40:15] oh judas could cast out devils and he
[1:40:17] could heal he could do a lot of things
[1:40:19] with the rest of them but when it come
[1:40:20] time to get up there to the upper room
[1:40:22] he couldn't get all the way to the holy
[1:40:25] ghost
[1:40:26] you see there's a mark in this thing
[1:40:29] there's a seal that comes when we can
[1:40:32] get to the upper room and receive the
[1:40:34] true baptism of the holy ghost and
[1:40:36] that's not a feeling that's not an
[1:40:38] emotion that's not a wiggle that ain't
[1:40:40] even talking in tongues
[1:40:42] that's the very same life that was in
[1:40:44] jesus christ poured out
[1:40:47] [Music]
[1:40:48] pour it out into my life into your life
[1:40:51] this same jesus here he is
[1:40:54] in here i didn't say me in here
[1:40:57] he's living in his
[1:40:59] in his sons
[1:41:01] in his daughters
[1:41:03] in his bride
[1:41:04] oh and it seemed like i could hear my
[1:41:07] mother clucking down there you know
[1:41:08] that's all the only mother i knew
[1:41:15] that's the best chicken i can do
[1:41:17] who can do a better one
[1:41:22] mama was just preaching away
[1:41:25] gathering all her little youngins
[1:41:27] all her little bitties under herself
[1:41:29] and i thought mama thank you you've been
[1:41:31] so good you hatched me you did a good
[1:41:33] job you fed me when i couldn't feed
[1:41:34] myself i'm so thankful but all of a
[1:41:36] sudden i heard a call
[1:41:39] from another dimension
[1:41:41] i heard an eagle scream
[1:41:44] nobody had to tell me no preacher no
[1:41:47] pastor no presbyter no overseer no
[1:41:51] district superintendent
[1:41:54] no pope
[1:41:56] no priest
[1:41:58] no reverend
[1:42:02] no pastor
[1:42:03] nobody had to tell me that i was
[1:42:05] connected to that
[1:42:06] something on the inside of the inside of
[1:42:09] the inside of me began to leave up and
[1:42:12] down just like jesus in mary's womb i
[1:42:15] began to leave
[1:42:17] my spirit man was quickened
[1:42:20] and i recognized my father on that day
[1:42:23] come on i realized i was living in a
[1:42:25] barnyard but i was destined for the
[1:42:27] skies
[1:42:28] well i had never flown before so i
[1:42:30] wasn't sure how it worked
[1:42:32] but that's okay
[1:42:34] he came for me
[1:42:36] as the story goes you've heard the story
[1:42:38] time and time again
[1:42:39] either the mother the father however you
[1:42:41] like to portray the story came right
[1:42:43] down right up along that fence post and
[1:42:45] i just hopped over on the back and he
[1:42:47] took me to the heights
[1:42:51] and i never wanted to go back to the
[1:42:53] confines of a barnyard again
[1:42:56] that's what the song meant
[1:42:59] long explanation i spent many years in
[1:43:01] that old barnyard but i was always an
[1:43:03] eagle and when i heard my papa scream
[1:43:06] when jehovah eagle screamed over my life
[1:43:09] i recognized that i was destined to be a
[1:43:11] little higher to live a little closer to
[1:43:13] the heavens
[1:43:15] than those that were destined to peck
[1:43:16] around on this earth so i'm encouraging
[1:43:19] you as the holy ghost came a few weeks
[1:43:21] ago guard your heart against any and all
[1:43:25] offense
[1:43:26] and purpose within yourself i'm going to
[1:43:29] be unoffendable
[1:43:35] how many of you are brave enough to say
[1:43:40] you're going to be tested
[1:43:43] before you go to bed tonight
[1:43:45] the enemy is going to test your
[1:43:48] testimony he's going to test your
[1:43:50] confession but you can't be afraid of
[1:43:53] the test you've got to stand on the word
[1:43:56] and the word said great peace have they
[1:43:59] which love the law of god and
[1:44:04] nothing
[1:44:12] not even when they call you holy roller
[1:44:14] holy roller
[1:44:16] nothing
[1:44:17] shall by any means offend them so the
[1:44:20] lord said stay close to one another
[1:44:22] don't let anything or anyone come
[1:44:24] between you and the rest of the body
[1:44:27] you pull into christ and as you pull
[1:44:30] into christ you pull into one another
[1:44:33] and and he just he just solidifies
[1:44:37] your place in his body
[1:44:39] oh yes and you keep away from the from
[1:44:43] the the spirit of speculation
[1:44:46] and uh and suspicion thank you
[1:44:50] stay away from that and you ask god for
[1:44:52] real holy ghost discernment
[1:44:54] anybody with me
[1:44:56] all right matthew 28 6
[1:44:58] as quick as possible
[1:45:00] i'm not not uh getting very far
[1:45:03] in what i have planned
[1:45:04] for today matthew 28 6. he is not here
[1:45:09] for he has risen
[1:45:11] and he said come see the place
[1:45:14] where the lord lay
[1:45:16] that's the end of matthew
[1:45:18] luke 24 49
[1:45:21] here is the end
[1:45:23] of of the book of luke
[1:45:25] and behold i send the promise of my
[1:45:28] father upon you but tarry ye in the city
[1:45:32] of jerusalem
[1:45:34] until ye be
[1:45:37] endued
[1:45:39] with power
[1:45:41] from on high
[1:45:42] so matthew ends with the resurrection of
[1:45:45] christ luke ends with the promise of the
[1:45:48] holy ghost mark 16 19.
[1:45:52] it ends with christ's ascension
[1:45:55] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[1:45:58] them he was received up into heaven and
[1:46:01] sat on the right hand of god which is
[1:46:04] the right hand of power and authority
[1:46:06] are you with me
[1:46:08] and then john 21 22 ends the book of
[1:46:11] john so we've talked about the ending
[1:46:14] may not be the exact last verse but the
[1:46:16] theme of the ending of matthew and then
[1:46:19] luke and then mark and here is the
[1:46:21] ending of the gospel of john jesus saith
[1:46:25] unto him if i will that he tarry till i
[1:46:28] come
[1:46:30] what is that to thee
[1:46:32] follow thou me
[1:46:34] who that is the theme of christ's coming
[1:46:37] number one
[1:46:39] and that is
[1:46:40] the advice that i've given you to live
[1:46:42] an overcoming life
[1:46:44] keep your eyes on jesus and all for
[1:46:45] people number one number two keep your
[1:46:48] eyes on jesus and off of other people
[1:46:51] number three keep your eyes on jesus and
[1:46:54] off of other people don't worry about
[1:46:56] what john is doing
[1:47:00] don't worry about what your brother and
[1:47:01] sister's doing you just keep the old man
[1:47:04] the all your own self the one who lives
[1:47:07] between your own two elbows you just
[1:47:09] keep lining up with the word staying in
[1:47:12] step with the holy ghost
[1:47:14] you don't have time to examine your
[1:47:16] brother's walk
[1:47:18] preach to us pastor you don't have time
[1:47:20] to examine your sister's walk
[1:47:22] keep your eyes on the lord and watch
[1:47:24] your own feet
[1:47:26] you walk according to the word and
[1:47:28] everything will be all right
[1:47:30] and you'll become an example
[1:47:32] if you're doing what's right you've got
[1:47:34] clean hands and a pure heart and you're
[1:47:36] walking straight narrow
[1:47:38] without unbelief separating yourself on
[1:47:41] a daily basis from all forms of unbelief
[1:47:43] daily we're daily sanctified by the
[1:47:46] washing of the water of the world is
[1:47:48] that the word we're constantly being
[1:47:50] changed
[1:47:52] from glory to glory from faith to faith
[1:47:55] from strength to strength always a
[1:47:58] process
[1:47:59] always a work in progress isn't that the
[1:48:02] goodness of god
[1:48:03] so don't watch other people
[1:48:06] well i'm looking for somebody to fail
[1:48:08] you'll find them
[1:48:10] why don't you see if you can see
[1:48:11] somebody succeeding
[1:48:13] why don't you get in the wagon with
[1:48:15] somebody that's making this thing work
[1:48:19] hallelujah
[1:48:21] you know it's amazing to me how people
[1:48:23] in the mulley grubs attract more people
[1:48:27] than those who carry the victory
[1:48:32] i've watched these spirits cry out to
[1:48:34] one another
[1:48:36] isn't that what he said
[1:48:38] you just watch somebody get under some
[1:48:40] kind of something and the next thing you
[1:48:42] know they'll be joined with somebody
[1:48:44] under something similar
[1:48:47] the next thing you know they'll have a
[1:48:48] little click going or a little clan
[1:48:50] going or a little group going all under
[1:48:52] the same kind of holy spirit
[1:48:55] if you were to interview them i'm
[1:48:56] preaching now
[1:48:58] if you were to try to interview them and
[1:48:59] what they're doing they're trying to
[1:49:00] help that sister
[1:49:02] they're trying to help that brother
[1:49:04] but but the truth of the matter is
[1:49:06] spirits attract spirits
[1:49:10] why don't you find somebody in this
[1:49:11] house that has some victory in their
[1:49:13] life
[1:49:14] why don't you find somebody that shout
[1:49:16] hallelujah not just in church but out
[1:49:19] there
[1:49:21] who will live above unbelief out there
[1:49:25] find them they're here find them see if
[1:49:28] you can hang around them some of the
[1:49:29] time see if they'll let you into their
[1:49:32] inner circle of friends that's what
[1:49:34] folks need to do
[1:49:36] amen you mean forsake people when
[1:49:38] they're down oh no
[1:49:41] but what i find out is you'll be more
[1:49:42] successful in helping them if you get
[1:49:44] full of god full of the holy ghost full
[1:49:47] of the victory then you can reach down
[1:49:49] and yank them up to where you are you
[1:49:51] don't come down to where they are to
[1:49:53] lift them higher you stand where you are
[1:49:55] and lift them up and say come on up here
[1:49:58] to the winning side
[1:50:01] there's power in the baptism of the holy
[1:50:04] ghost
[1:50:05] anybody with me
[1:50:07] so then i read acts 1 and 11 and what
[1:50:10] acts 1 1-11 does
[1:50:12] is it ties together
[1:50:15] all four gospels and the theme that each
[1:50:19] of those gospels end with and it starts
[1:50:22] introducing what is to come the gospels
[1:50:26] have come to an end and the earthly
[1:50:28] ministry of our lord has come to an end
[1:50:31] in his own personal body do you
[1:50:33] understand that and now the ministry of
[1:50:36] jesus is about to multiply
[1:50:38] amen
[1:50:40] it's about to explode
[1:50:42] anybody here
[1:50:43] it's about to explode
[1:50:45] because instead of one jesus
[1:50:50] look out preacher
[1:50:52] that old devil standing over there in
[1:50:54] the graveyard he's jumping around and
[1:50:56] carrying on uh he thinks he's defeated
[1:50:59] the son of god
[1:51:01] he's knocked him out for the last count
[1:51:04] three days and three nights
[1:51:06] he's guarded the tomb jumping up and
[1:51:08] down having himself a party
[1:51:11] because he feels like he has defeated
[1:51:13] the gospel
[1:51:16] even the mother of jesus is weeping
[1:51:19] the disciples who loved him the most
[1:51:21] they're discouraged
[1:51:22] they're all hiding out in the house over
[1:51:24] there somewhere
[1:51:26] afraid of going to jail
[1:51:28] there's not much victory in the church
[1:51:30] at that time
[1:51:32] everybody's down in the mouth
[1:51:34] except the enemy he is dancing with glee
[1:51:37] i've stopped this thing
[1:51:39] come on i couldn't stop the seed
[1:51:43] couldn't stop him from coming
[1:51:45] couldn't stop him from living
[1:51:47] couldn't stop him from dying
[1:51:50] but i can hold him here
[1:51:52] because i alone have power over the
[1:51:54] grave
[1:51:55] and death is in my hand the old enemy
[1:51:57] thought and he is having himself a time
[1:52:00] but what he doesn't know
[1:52:04] is that before jesus left his earthly
[1:52:06] body left left his earthly ministry he
[1:52:08] said to them you better get up to
[1:52:10] jerusalem now
[1:52:12] because there's going to be an infusion
[1:52:14] of power that's going to come from on
[1:52:17] high and you're going to have to have
[1:52:18] that to stand
[1:52:21] so whatever you do don't miss your
[1:52:22] appointment with me in jerusalem
[1:52:25] get there and wait on the promise of the
[1:52:28] father am i am i still telling the truth
[1:52:31] good good good good just laying the
[1:52:32] foundation here and so they gathered
[1:52:35] they gathered in the upper room miracle
[1:52:37] of miracles of miracles
[1:52:40] all in one mind and one accord
[1:52:45] do you know how hard it would be to have
[1:52:47] a a christian gathering in this city or
[1:52:51] this community or this area and get
[1:52:52] everybody to be in one mind and one
[1:52:54] accord
[1:52:57] this bunch of intercessors we have today
[1:53:00] you know
[1:53:01] some are right in tune
[1:53:03] and some are way off tuned
[1:53:07] and they're calling down everything
[1:53:10] shooting errors at everything
[1:53:12] taking authority over everything you
[1:53:15] better listen
[1:53:16] praying over everything
[1:53:19] and can't agree on anything
[1:53:21] hello
[1:53:22] can't agree on anything but this was a
[1:53:25] time that 120 had gathered in the upper
[1:53:29] room and they were in one mine and one
[1:53:32] accord and their desire was to receive
[1:53:35] the promise of the father got to have
[1:53:37] him got to have him got to have him
[1:53:40] can't leave without him going to stay
[1:53:42] here till he comes
[1:53:44] somebody said well what about soldier
[1:53:46] ain't got time to think about that
[1:53:48] they get their mind right back on the
[1:53:50] lord come on come on come on
[1:53:52] my jewish messianic jewish friends say
[1:53:55] you don't understand what a miracle that
[1:53:56] is
[1:53:57] not only were you getting 120 to think
[1:53:59] on the same thing but you're getting 120
[1:54:01] jews to agree
[1:54:02] that's what my friends say
[1:54:05] they say you can't get 10 jews to come
[1:54:07] into agreement about anything in
[1:54:08] doctrine
[1:54:10] and so to have 120 gathered there in the
[1:54:12] upper room in one mind and one accord
[1:54:14] waiting on the promise of to be endued
[1:54:16] with power from on high must have been a
[1:54:19] powerful thing
[1:54:21] in the enemy down there still rejoicing
[1:54:23] and carrying on the resurrection has
[1:54:25] taken place
[1:54:27] so that upset him
[1:54:30] he thought then i messed up here
[1:54:33] i couldn't keep him in the grave
[1:54:35] and then the next thing you know 40 days
[1:54:37] later he leaves
[1:54:39] and the enemy's glad again
[1:54:42] couldn't keep him from raising from the
[1:54:43] dead but run him out of town
[1:54:46] i saw him myself on the mount of olives
[1:54:49] when he ascended left the earth and here
[1:54:51] we are and i'm in charge again
[1:54:53] oh but he didn't know what was about to
[1:54:56] take place are you with me he didn't
[1:54:58] know what was going on in the upper room
[1:55:01] the same pillar of fire that had led the
[1:55:03] children of israel through the
[1:55:05] wilderness into the promised land was
[1:55:07] about to show up hallelujah
[1:55:10] on mount zion again
[1:55:12] this time that one pillar of fire would
[1:55:15] divide itself into 120 licks of fire all
[1:55:21] the same god all the same fire all the
[1:55:25] same holy ghost
[1:55:28] jesus said i will not leave you
[1:55:29] comfortless
[1:55:33] the extreme trinitarians like to say
[1:55:35] they love this verse
[1:55:38] they love to say
[1:55:39] i i will send you the comforter
[1:55:43] because they love to emphasize that
[1:55:45] there was a difference
[1:55:47] and of course there was we're talking
[1:55:49] about a spirit in a body and a spirit
[1:55:51] not in a in a body of course there was a
[1:55:54] difference but the bible's clear hear o
[1:55:56] israel
[1:55:59] the lord thy god is one
[1:56:01] i know the church likes to say three
[1:56:03] persons
[1:56:04] and we can't quite grasp that because we
[1:56:06] would think of three people and god is
[1:56:08] not three people
[1:56:10] he's three offices
[1:56:11] he's three manifestations or three
[1:56:14] demonstrations they're all the same
[1:56:16] spirit and if that is not the case then
[1:56:19] jesus had two fathers
[1:56:24] if the church could just get a little
[1:56:26] unconfused these days
[1:56:28] he didn't have two fathers
[1:56:31] somebody said well he had the heavenly
[1:56:32] father well then why didn't the bible
[1:56:34] say that the heavenly father
[1:56:36] overshadowed mary and she received them
[1:56:39] no no i didn't say that at all it said
[1:56:41] and the holy ghost overshadowed her and
[1:56:44] she conceived
[1:56:46] because the holy ghost was the same
[1:56:48] spirit
[1:56:49] not the same manifestation not the same
[1:56:51] office not the same demonstration but
[1:56:54] the same spirit
[1:56:56] as the father are you with me
[1:56:58] and so this is a very powerful thing
[1:57:00] that took place that day
[1:57:02] and i wished i could have seen the enemy
[1:57:05] don't you wish you could have seen the
[1:57:06] devil
[1:57:07] he's just skipping around i got rid of
[1:57:10] jesus
[1:57:15] i saw him when he left
[1:57:20] he won't be back because he knows that
[1:57:22] i'm in charge
[1:57:25] come on
[1:57:26] and all of a sudden down the road a bit
[1:57:29] in jerusalem
[1:57:31] they're praying they're in one mind
[1:57:34] they're in one accord and the promise of
[1:57:37] the father begins to be poured out on
[1:57:39] their head like a mighty rushing wind
[1:57:43] the holy ghost blew
[1:57:46] into that room hallelujah
[1:57:48] the holy ghost sat on their heads like
[1:57:50] cloven tongues of fire but he didn't
[1:57:53] stay on top of their head
[1:57:56] he filled out their heart
[1:57:58] he filled up who they were
[1:58:01] oh and the end of me i mean he's about
[1:58:03] to have a major breakdown standing
[1:58:06] outside the upper room now watching
[1:58:08] what's happening and he said oh
[1:58:10] what is this going on they're staggering
[1:58:12] around like drunk men speaking in some
[1:58:14] kind of foreign language
[1:58:16] i don't know what's going on
[1:58:19] but he was waiting on them to begin to
[1:58:20] come out and here come one and he said
[1:58:22] whoa
[1:58:24] he seems to be like jesus
[1:58:29] oh here come another one hey there's
[1:58:31] something for me
[1:58:33] he seems to be like jesus
[1:58:37] get it
[1:58:38] why did they sit because they had the
[1:58:40] same spirit that's why you and i need to
[1:58:42] be like jesus
[1:58:44] that's why we should be perceived as
[1:58:45] being like him because we claim to have
[1:58:48] the holy ghost
[1:58:50] which is jesus said not only did he say
[1:58:52] i'll send you another comforter but he
[1:58:54] said i will not leave you comfortless
[1:58:58] i
[1:59:00] i
[1:59:02] ah yes he said i'll pray the father and
[1:59:04] he'll send another comforter yes he said
[1:59:06] it
[1:59:07] but he said i will not leave you
[1:59:08] comfortless
[1:59:09] i
[1:59:11] i
[1:59:13] oh i feel good i'm not doing much
[1:59:15] preaching but i feel good anyway
[1:59:17] i
[1:59:18] i
[1:59:20] will come to you
[1:59:21] and that's exactly what happened on the
[1:59:23] day of pentecost jesus came to his
[1:59:25] church
[1:59:26] no wonder they call it the birth of the
[1:59:28] church
[1:59:30] no wonder they call it the beginning of
[1:59:32] the church
[1:59:33] because jesus came to his own house
[1:59:36] and he filled
[1:59:37] 120 with the same life that he carried
[1:59:41] on the earth while he walked among being
[1:59:44] hallelujah and no wonder the enemy said
[1:59:46] one two
[1:59:48] three jesus four jesuses five six seven
[1:59:51] eight nine fifty seventy five jesus what
[1:59:55] will i do a hundred oh 110.
[2:00:00] he's about to lose his mind as a 120
[2:00:04] stumble out
[2:00:09] i got to help myself preach hey man
[2:00:11] brother
[2:00:13] nothing but the truth has 120 jesus to
[2:00:16] stumble out of the upper room filled
[2:00:18] with the same life that jesus had on
[2:00:21] here come on
[2:00:22] [Applause]
[2:00:23] are you preaching some kind of funny
[2:00:25] doctrine i am not
[2:00:29] same spirit
[2:00:31] now if you if you've got another spirit
[2:00:36] you can confess that and be delivered
[2:00:41] but if you've got him you've got the
[2:00:42] same spirit
[2:00:44] i'll come to you i'll come to you i'll
[2:00:47] come to you and he did
[2:00:49] whoa
[2:00:50] wonder what the enemy would think today
[2:00:51] when there's a bride all over the world
[2:00:54] in every nation of the world
[2:00:56] some of them connected to this service
[2:00:58] by streaming
[2:00:59] here there and everywhere in many many
[2:01:02] continents just just this little house
[2:01:04] reaching out to many continents today
[2:01:07] and the enemy can't do anything he tries
[2:01:10] he huffs and he puffs and he gets among
[2:01:13] us and he tries to distract us and he
[2:01:16] tries to discourage us he tries to
[2:01:18] depress us he tries to drive us to our
[2:01:21] own beds with grief
[2:01:24] he tries to affect our walk
[2:01:28] he tries to make us feel like everybody
[2:01:30] hates us and everybody's against us he
[2:01:32] tries to talk us into eating worms
[2:01:38] but you know what we do we just keep
[2:01:39] coming
[2:01:40] and we just keep praising
[2:01:42] and we just keep getting in that having
[2:01:44] come on church
[2:01:45] we just keep getting in that presence
[2:01:48] because we know that every change we
[2:01:50] need
[2:01:52] every deliverance that we need
[2:01:55] is found in that anointing
[2:01:58] it's found in that presence
[2:02:00] don't you settle for a dry dusty
[2:02:03] experience with god you get one that has
[2:02:06] life in it
[2:02:10] yes
[2:02:11] it'll change you it'll transform you
[2:02:14] anybody here
[2:02:16] all right so there's three uh initially
[2:02:19] there are three
[2:02:20] feasts
[2:02:21] that are what we call pilgrimage feast
[2:02:24] and in these three feasts all the male
[2:02:27] of israel were commanded
[2:02:31] not just invited but heavenly and
[2:02:33] heavily instructed
[2:02:34] you get up to jerusalem to celebrate
[2:02:37] and you need to be there all the males
[2:02:40] of israel get there and that's passover
[2:02:43] which celebrates the deliverance from
[2:02:45] egypt and the death of the passover lamb
[2:02:48] first fruits which is the beginning of
[2:02:50] the barley harvest and the wave remember
[2:02:53] the sheaf is waved over the harvest
[2:02:57] the first barley that comes to maturity
[2:02:59] is sheaved up it's bound up in a sheaf
[2:03:02] are you still here
[2:03:03] and way the priest went out into the
[2:03:05] field just like the jubilee priest did
[2:03:07] they went out into the field and they
[2:03:09] waved the mature grain
[2:03:13] oh can't you see church
[2:03:15] can't you see the hour that we're living
[2:03:17] in now can't you see what god wants to
[2:03:19] do in this day
[2:03:21] don't you know he wants to bring some
[2:03:22] sons to maturity
[2:03:24] don't you know he wants to bring us out
[2:03:26] of religion and into sonship and
[2:03:29] adoption don't you know
[2:03:32] that's what he's doing that's why he's
[2:03:33] letting you feel his presence he's not
[2:03:35] trying to take you back to something way
[2:03:38] back there somewhere he's trying to let
[2:03:40] you know you didn't need to lay that
[2:03:41] down you needed to bring the good holy
[2:03:44] ghost with you
[2:03:45] [Applause]
[2:03:47] you don't leave the holy ghost at
[2:03:49] pentecost you bring the holy ghost with
[2:03:50] you
[2:03:51] through through shovel all the way to
[2:03:54] sukkot
[2:03:55] you just bring him with you
[2:03:58] until he tabernacles there
[2:04:00] he's the same holy ghost
[2:04:02] he moves the same today as he always
[2:04:04] moved
[2:04:06] he testifies of himself the same way
[2:04:08] today that he always testified of
[2:04:10] himself i do not teach
[2:04:12] because i cannot find scripture that
[2:04:14] says
[2:04:15] that speaking in tongues is the initial
[2:04:17] evidence of the holy ghost i know that
[2:04:19] upsets my pentecostal brethren
[2:04:21] but i believe in speaking in tongues oh
[2:04:23] yes i do
[2:04:25] oh yes i do but i don't believe in
[2:04:27] hanging everything on one thing
[2:04:30] and then convincing people that because
[2:04:32] they talked in tongues a little or their
[2:04:34] tongue got a little clacky or confused
[2:04:37] i've seen it don't you tell me
[2:04:39] oh
[2:04:40] i've been in those meetings
[2:04:43] oh they don't do that today yes they do
[2:04:45] see my tie
[2:04:48] i've heard them
[2:04:50] all you have to do is believe for the
[2:04:52] holy ghost and then repeat after me see
[2:04:54] my tie
[2:04:55] tie my tie
[2:04:59] boy when i hear people talking in
[2:05:01] tongues like that i look
[2:05:04] when i hear them say see my time i i'm
[2:05:07] looking
[2:05:09] i want to make sure they got the real
[2:05:11] one
[2:05:13] they didn't get some kind of oh yeah i
[2:05:16] remember a preacher that come through
[2:05:17] when i was a boy and he said well just
[2:05:20] just just name the japanese brands
[2:05:30] honda kawasaki
[2:05:34] and you'll have it
[2:05:37] now that's why i don't teach it that way
[2:05:39] but i believe when you receive the
[2:05:41] baptism of the holy ghost and he begins
[2:05:43] to work in you he'll bring your life
[2:05:45] into alignment with the word and i
[2:05:48] believe that some time or another you
[2:05:51] will speak in tongues
[2:05:53] your life and your holy ghost will
[2:05:56] testify of itself by the way you live
[2:05:58] but i also believe
[2:06:03] brother daniel sent me a quote the other
[2:06:06] day where brother branham is getting
[2:06:07] excited and he's kind of praying in
[2:06:09] tongues
[2:06:10] and what was that the editor called it
[2:06:13] blank spot on tape
[2:06:19] one blank
[2:06:22] the holy ghost was witnessing
[2:06:26] yeah did it say that too
[2:06:28] unintelligible words
[2:06:33] afraid afraid to say
[2:06:35] praying in tongues
[2:06:37] afraid to say that
[2:06:39] don't want to upset the house let me
[2:06:42] tell you something
[2:06:44] when you get filled with the holy ghost
[2:06:48] he knows how to talk
[2:06:52] he's still a walking talking holy ghost
[2:06:56] so don't you ever go out of this place
[2:06:58] and say my preacher doesn't believe in
[2:06:59] speaking in tongues i do believe
[2:07:01] but i don't believe that you can measure
[2:07:04] somebody's holy ghost because they have
[2:07:06] the ability
[2:07:09] to talk in some language you see the
[2:07:11] hindu priests they do that
[2:07:17] down in haiti where they have all kinds
[2:07:19] of foreign religions i've been far
[2:07:21] enough close enough to some of them to
[2:07:23] see how they get caught up in some kind
[2:07:25] of ecstasy where they start talking in
[2:07:27] some kind of emphatic language too but
[2:07:30] that's not the genuine holy ghost
[2:07:32] let me tell you something if you want to
[2:07:34] if you want a real evidence of the holy
[2:07:36] ghost in your life you let the word of
[2:07:39] god cause you to lie let the holy ghost
[2:07:41] cause you to line up with that word and
[2:07:44] you start manifesting the character in
[2:07:45] the life of jesus christ you got the
[2:07:47] holy ghost
[2:07:48] [Music]
[2:07:50] anybody with me
[2:07:51] oh somebody didn't like that
[2:07:54] [Music]
[2:07:55] you just don't know what that does to me
[2:07:58] it makes me want to preach more
[2:08:01] so that was first fruits the celebration
[2:08:03] of the barley harvest they waved it over
[2:08:05] the harvest and said this is just the
[2:08:07] beginning of the mature grain and they
[2:08:09] waved it over the barley harvest and
[2:08:10] this was a testimony to all that as the
[2:08:13] first fruits have come to maturity so
[2:08:16] will the rest of the harvest
[2:08:18] in it wonderful when god gives us
[2:08:19] forerunners
[2:08:22] you hear me talking about brother random
[2:08:24] a lot and that offends some people get
[2:08:25] over it
[2:08:27] get over it if you're in the lutheran
[2:08:28] church to talk about luther
[2:08:34] if you're in the baptist independent
[2:08:35] baptist talk about rice
[2:08:39] so don't you get yourself all been out
[2:08:42] of shape because i mentioned brother
[2:08:43] branham i mentioned brother branham
[2:08:44] because i believe with everything that's
[2:08:46] within me
[2:08:47] that he was a son who reached maturity
[2:08:49] in his age i believe it
[2:08:52] and i believe god allowed that to happen
[2:08:54] as an example
[2:08:56] not so that you would turn in worship
[2:09:00] not so that you would come and say all
[2:09:02] kinds of crazy things like people say
[2:09:04] today
[2:09:05] that he was infallible
[2:09:08] you're kidding me
[2:09:11] but so that you would know what a mature
[2:09:13] son looks like
[2:09:15] and how one operates
[2:09:17] i believe there are others
[2:09:19] but i'm just using the one i often use
[2:09:21] the one that i know god has identified
[2:09:23] me with and i'm not ashamed and if that
[2:09:26] bothers you you can click off just like
[2:09:28] you clicked on
[2:09:33] because you're not going to change my
[2:09:34] mind
[2:09:36] i've been watching this too long i've
[2:09:38] been seeing these things come to pass
[2:09:40] just like they said just like he
[2:09:41] prophesied they would here we are now
[2:09:46] here we are russia raging again you know
[2:09:48] trying to stretch a little bit
[2:09:50] he told us all these things
[2:09:53] he also said don't fear communism
[2:09:56] fear romanism
[2:10:00] which is not just the natural
[2:10:02] restoration of the roman empire but the
[2:10:04] religious restoration of the roman
[2:10:06] empire under the catholic church
[2:10:08] you won't hear a lot of preaching about
[2:10:09] that
[2:10:10] and yet we found out there are more
[2:10:12] leaders who believe that then will
[2:10:13] preach it
[2:10:15] because they know how unpopular they
[2:10:17] would become if they were to identify
[2:10:20] who she is
[2:10:24] amen and the pentecostal church they
[2:10:26] were so afraid to declare such a thing
[2:10:29] as that that some of them begin to
[2:10:31] embrace the idea that islam
[2:10:34] is the antichrist
[2:10:36] system
[2:10:38] islam
[2:10:39] now here's a big problem with that the
[2:10:41] scripture told us that the false vine
[2:10:45] the false seed
[2:10:47] would manifest itself and it would look
[2:10:50] very much like the real
[2:10:53] is that true
[2:10:54] so when we examine the the the uh
[2:10:56] islamic system
[2:10:58] and the faith of the islam people
[2:11:00] islamic people would you say that looks
[2:11:02] so much like christianity that someone
[2:11:04] could miss
[2:11:06] not at all
[2:11:08] oh no that's not the way the deception
[2:11:10] comes anybody's still with me
[2:11:12] you were happy a minute ago did we get
[2:11:13] too tough for you
[2:11:15] does this not thrill you too
[2:11:17] it thrills me
[2:11:22] because i know one of these days there's
[2:11:24] going to be a pope sitting on his throne
[2:11:28] so when i see the one we have now
[2:11:30] stumbling around the way he's stumbling
[2:11:32] around i don't know if you've seen it
[2:11:33] lately he can hardly move
[2:11:35] when i see that i know
[2:11:37] you don't have to be prophetic to know
[2:11:38] he's on the way out
[2:11:40] and another one's coming will this be
[2:11:42] the one i don't know
[2:11:45] but one of these days he's coming
[2:11:47] and the scripture has told us just how
[2:11:50] that thing will operate so i'm glad to
[2:11:53] have my eyes open in this hour anybody
[2:11:55] with me
[2:11:56] so we're we're pilgrim we're making our
[2:11:58] pilgrimage to jerusalem for passover and
[2:12:00] first fruits and then the third is
[2:12:01] shavuot or pentecost and pentecost is
[2:12:04] the beginning of the wheat harvest
[2:12:06] and do you know how shavuot was
[2:12:08] celebrated in the bible the priest would
[2:12:10] bake two beautiful loaves full of leaven
[2:12:15] passover there was no leaven but in
[2:12:17] shovel these were big fat healthy
[2:12:19] looking loaves
[2:12:21] and the priest would pray over these
[2:12:23] loaves and he would wave them in the
[2:12:25] presence of the people to celebrate the
[2:12:27] beginning of the wheat harvest and to
[2:12:30] say to all of the wheat
[2:12:32] growing in the field here is the fruit
[2:12:36] of mature wheat
[2:12:39] and as this has matured so can you
[2:12:43] shovel oat celebrates the giving of the
[2:12:45] instruction on mount sinai the giving of
[2:12:47] the law
[2:12:48] and it celebrates the birth of the
[2:12:50] church
[2:12:51] which is the true pentecost that fell in
[2:12:53] acts chapter 2. the bible said and when
[2:12:56] the day this is acts chapter 2 verse 1
[2:12:58] and when the day of pentecost was
[2:13:02] that's big
[2:13:04] big
[2:13:06] this is a greek expression here that
[2:13:08] says when it was filled completely
[2:13:11] everything that had to take place before
[2:13:14] the holy ghost could be poured out when
[2:13:16] everything was in place
[2:13:18] and the people come together in one mind
[2:13:20] and one accord when the day of pentecost
[2:13:22] was fully come or when the feast of
[2:13:24] shavuot was fully come see there was a
[2:13:26] huge crowd god knew exactly what he was
[2:13:28] doing by getting all the males to
[2:13:30] jerusalem for shavuot because they were
[2:13:32] going to get to see with their eyes and
[2:13:34] hear with their ears the outpouring of
[2:13:36] the holy ghost are you still there
[2:13:38] and and so they were all there with one
[2:13:41] accord in one place
[2:13:44] and suddenly there came a sound from
[2:13:46] heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and
[2:13:49] it filled all the house where they were
[2:13:51] sitting
[2:13:52] and there appeared unto them cloven
[2:13:54] tongues like as a fire and it sat upon
[2:13:57] each of them all of them
[2:13:59] and they were all filled
[2:14:02] do it again lord
[2:14:04] anybody need a refilling of the holy
[2:14:06] ghost
[2:14:07] do it again lord there's one baptism
[2:14:10] of the holy ghost but many refillings
[2:14:13] you can get refilled with the holy ghost
[2:14:15] every sunday if you want to and you
[2:14:16] don't have to wait to sunday
[2:14:18] [Applause]
[2:14:20] you can get it on tuesday night
[2:14:23] when we're gathered here in his name but
[2:14:25] you can get it on monday night at home
[2:14:26] in your living room
[2:14:30] or wednesday morning in your prayer time
[2:14:32] you can be refilled with the holy ghost
[2:14:34] as often as you present yourself under
[2:14:37] the spout
[2:14:41] and i encourage you to get as much of
[2:14:43] him as you possibly can and i encourage
[2:14:46] you to call the holy ghost him
[2:14:48] instead of it
[2:14:50] because he is not an inanimate object he
[2:14:53] is the person in life of jesus christ
[2:14:55] poured out inside of the believer and
[2:14:57] they were all filled with the holy ghost
[2:14:59] and began to speak with other tongues
[2:15:01] i'm not surprised
[2:15:04] as the spirit
[2:15:06] not see my tie ride my kawasaki
[2:15:13] not as someone got up and told them you
[2:15:15] know repeat your syllables i heard that
[2:15:17] too aeiou
[2:15:20] but as the holy ghost got in their
[2:15:22] tongue
[2:15:23] as the spirit of god got in their tongue
[2:15:25] and the spirit began to give them the
[2:15:27] utterance and they began to speak out
[2:15:30] what the spirit was getting giving them
[2:15:31] the utterance to say and it marveled the
[2:15:34] people that were there do you believe
[2:15:36] that they said what's going on here are
[2:15:38] all these men galileans
[2:15:40] then why is it that we who have come
[2:15:42] from the nations
[2:15:44] hear our language being spoken by poor
[2:15:49] galileans
[2:15:52] no education and yet they speak our
[2:15:54] tongue
[2:15:56] they were speaking tongues of men how
[2:15:58] many of you know tongues is not only a
[2:16:00] manifestation of the tongues of angels
[2:16:02] but it can also be a manifestation of
[2:16:04] learned tongues of men that you've not
[2:16:06] learned
[2:16:08] but the holy ghost falls how effective
[2:16:10] is that in the mission field
[2:16:12] it was pretty effective one night many
[2:16:14] years ago in the tucson tabernacle
[2:16:17] when the holy ghost fell on me in the
[2:16:18] aisle and i began to speak fluent
[2:16:20] spanish to a woman who was there with a
[2:16:23] real need in her life
[2:16:26] and when i preach this is the truth
[2:16:28] every time i preach at the tabernacle
[2:16:30] since then when brother aaron introduces
[2:16:32] me to come he tells that story because
[2:16:34] it was one that he was a personal
[2:16:35] witness to he knew that i couldn't even
[2:16:37] say taco right
[2:16:41] and yet they heard the holy ghost
[2:16:44] speaking in a language at that woman it
[2:16:47] happened and it happened in uh in uh
[2:16:50] i'll get there in a minute it happened
[2:16:52] in quebec
[2:16:54] nobody dislikes
[2:16:57] the attitude of the french in quebec
[2:17:00] like i did as a boy you couldn't even
[2:17:02] get an operator to speak english on the
[2:17:04] phone
[2:17:07] they were so upset with canada and so
[2:17:09] upset with america they wanted to be
[2:17:11] their own nation and the operators
[2:17:13] wouldn't even speak english to you
[2:17:17] and you didn't have cell phones
[2:17:19] you had calling cards anybody that old
[2:17:23] had calling cards and you can't use that
[2:17:25] calling card without somebody to help
[2:17:27] you and they would speak english to me
[2:17:30] and i was told that there have to be
[2:17:32] bilingual or they wouldn't be hired
[2:17:34] but they were so proud of that french
[2:17:36] language
[2:17:37] that they wouldn't even speak to me in
[2:17:39] english but the holy ghost fell in the
[2:17:42] prayer line one night and there was a
[2:17:44] woman and her son standing there in line
[2:17:46] and the holy ghost began to speak to her
[2:17:48] in fluent french and the whole church
[2:17:51] and even the skeptics that were there
[2:17:53] the whole church heard it and they knew
[2:17:56] that i couldn't even say voice correct
[2:18:01] or escargot
[2:18:03] so they knew that had to be the holy
[2:18:05] ghost so i can see where speaking these
[2:18:08] learned tongues of men that you've never
[2:18:10] learned i can see where that would be a
[2:18:11] very powerful thing but don't forget the
[2:18:13] bible also says that they were speaking
[2:18:16] tongues of angels
[2:18:18] which means heavenly languages of
[2:18:20] intercession and deliverance and power
[2:18:22] and revelation that you may not get the
[2:18:25] understanding of but it shifts the
[2:18:26] heavens
[2:18:27] because the other dimension recognizes
[2:18:30] the authority of heaven's language
[2:18:33] you you with me
[2:18:34] okay now we're going to move on
[2:18:37] if i were going to and i'm skipping you
[2:18:40] see all these pages skip skip skipping
[2:18:43] skipping
[2:18:46] if i were to give this a title
[2:18:53] i guess i would call this why i am
[2:18:57] pentecostal
[2:19:02] i preached a message similar many years
[2:19:04] ago
[2:19:05] that pentecost the title was pentecost
[2:19:07] is not a swear word
[2:19:11] because i have come into ranks in that
[2:19:14] hour where people were treating
[2:19:15] pentecost as though it was some kind of
[2:19:16] curse word
[2:19:18] huh
[2:19:20] and so i'm with some of these folks
[2:19:22] sometime when people ask them what they
[2:19:23] believe or where they go to church
[2:19:27] and they start stumbling around like
[2:19:32] baboons
[2:19:40] because they don't know who they are
[2:19:44] [Music]
[2:19:46] so sometimes they'll say we are
[2:19:48] non-denominational
[2:19:50] what does that mean
[2:19:54] i don't even know what that means
[2:19:56] non-denominational
[2:19:59] some people say fundamental that can
[2:20:01] mean a lot
[2:20:04] some people will say i'm evangelical i
[2:20:07] don't think you want to be in that boat
[2:20:11] because there's gay priest in the
[2:20:12] evangelical movement
[2:20:14] so i'm not sure you want to be in that
[2:20:15] anybody's still here
[2:20:18] and then some are bold enough to say
[2:20:20] well i believe the message of a prophet
[2:20:23] that's all right nothing wrong with that
[2:20:24] i do i follow a message of a prophet but
[2:20:27] it used to be easy
[2:20:30] we used to just be able to say well i go
[2:20:32] to a pentecostal church
[2:20:35] but see people have come to believe that
[2:20:37] pentecost is a denomination
[2:20:41] or that is an organization
[2:20:43] but the prophet of god for us was very
[2:20:45] clear
[2:20:46] he said it is not an organization it is
[2:20:49] not a denomination it is an experience
[2:20:56] so why don't we just say i am a
[2:20:58] pentecostal by experience
[2:21:02] not really a part of any pentecostal
[2:21:03] denomination but i believe in the power
[2:21:07] of pentecost
[2:21:10] i'm a word believer somebody said well
[2:21:12] then they're going to put you in the upc
[2:21:14] or they're going to put you there let
[2:21:16] them put us where they want to put us
[2:21:20] i'm not ashamed of pentecost i want
[2:21:23] somebody to go tell somebody to tell
[2:21:25] somebody i'm not ashamed of a
[2:21:27] pentecostal experience
[2:21:32] in a message called the supernatural are
[2:21:34] you still here we got to hurry we got to
[2:21:36] hurry let's see my watch is dead
[2:21:38] 116. we're doing good
[2:21:42] paragraph 20 but it's the attitude of
[2:21:44] the people
[2:21:46] that brings the results
[2:21:50] did you know you can come to church with
[2:21:51] the wrong attitude
[2:21:53] and leave with nothing
[2:21:56] but you can come with the right attitude
[2:21:57] in the right spirit and you have all you
[2:21:59] need
[2:22:00] it's always there it's always there no
[2:22:02] matter what's going on you may not even
[2:22:03] like what's going on but you come with
[2:22:05] the right spirit and the right attitude
[2:22:07] he said that's the reason at pentecost
[2:22:10] they had to go to an upper room and pray
[2:22:12] until the holy ghost came because they
[2:22:14] got in one place
[2:22:17] and one accord
[2:22:18] how many of you think we ought to do it
[2:22:20] every week
[2:22:21] we're coming together in one house
[2:22:23] and we're coming together with one
[2:22:24] purpose and that is to lift up jesus
[2:22:27] christ and receive from his word
[2:22:29] he said it's the atmosphere what brings
[2:22:31] the results anybody believe that i do i
[2:22:34] do
[2:22:35] he said let every man and woman in this
[2:22:37] building this morning boy or girl get
[2:22:39] everything from their minds but the lord
[2:22:41] jesus and believe that he's standing
[2:22:44] present right now and you'll see
[2:22:46] something happening that'll cause
[2:22:48] headlines in newspapers in the morning
[2:22:50] that's right he said it's
[2:22:52] atmosphere
[2:22:57] you just let somebody come in with a
[2:22:58] rotten way
[2:23:00] with a critical spirit
[2:23:01] with a spirit of offense you just let
[2:23:04] somebody come in with some kind of demon
[2:23:06] on their life
[2:23:08] and if we're not careful that thing will
[2:23:10] influence our worship that thing will
[2:23:11] get on us it'll bind us up we'll get all
[2:23:14] stiff we'll get to where we can't enter
[2:23:15] in
[2:23:17] so we have to make up our minds that
[2:23:18] that the body of christ sets the
[2:23:20] atmosphere for this house
[2:23:22] nothing is going to keep me nothing
[2:23:25] nothing nothing
[2:23:29] i'm going to come to get everything that
[2:23:31] i can get can everything i get receive
[2:23:34] everything that i need because i've come
[2:23:36] with that kind of a determination in my
[2:23:38] heart it's atmosphere he said i don't
[2:23:40] believe in joking from the pulpit
[2:23:42] because the pulpits no place to joke
[2:23:44] i know i've been guilty of that on
[2:23:46] occasion
[2:23:47] and by only excuses you just can't help
[2:23:49] it if you're funny sometime
[2:23:52] but i try not to tell jokes
[2:23:54] it's a sacred place he said i'm quoting
[2:23:57] something from us here mr bosworth how
[2:23:59] many of you know who brother bosworth
[2:24:01] was he wrote christ the healer very good
[2:24:03] sense of humor and he said brother
[2:24:05] branham to prove that its atmosphere
[2:24:07] said
[2:24:08] oh i like this one i've read it many
[2:24:10] times you could take a hint egg and put
[2:24:12] it under a puppy
[2:24:14] and tie him down and it would hatch a
[2:24:16] chicken
[2:24:19] it's not who the mother is
[2:24:22] it's the warmth that that body creates
[2:24:24] it's the warmth of the puppy's body that
[2:24:26] would hatch the egg anybody with me he
[2:24:28] said it don't have to be under the hen
[2:24:29] it can be under a puppy it could be an
[2:24:31] incubator it's the
[2:24:33] [Applause]
[2:24:34] and it's the atmosphere that brings the
[2:24:36] miraculous
[2:24:38] did you it's not the preacher that
[2:24:39] brings the miraculous
[2:24:41] it's not the singing that brings the
[2:24:43] miraculous
[2:24:46] it's the atmosphere and powers of god
[2:24:49] among the people it's the atmosphere of
[2:24:51] the people and when people get to a
[2:24:53] place they're reasoning and wondering
[2:24:55] and stewing and thinking and all tore up
[2:24:59] and don't know where they do stand half
[2:25:01] of them not even scripturally taught how
[2:25:03] can you expect the atmosphere to be
[2:25:05] right good question you can't do it it
[2:25:07] won't be right it's got to be in one
[2:25:09] accord in one place and settle down with
[2:25:12] one motive
[2:25:15] some people come and all they can think
[2:25:17] of is getting their songs sung
[2:25:22] or getting their little part of the
[2:25:23] service taken care of i want you to know
[2:25:25] there's a whole lot more to a service
[2:25:27] than just your part
[2:25:31] i don't have much confidence in a
[2:25:33] preacher that can't worship during
[2:25:34] worship
[2:25:36] but he wants everybody to scream when
[2:25:38] he's preaching
[2:25:39] [Music]
[2:25:41] i believe a preacher ought to lead the
[2:25:43] body
[2:25:44] i believe he ought to worship and show
[2:25:46] the people what worship is
[2:25:48] and what praise is
[2:25:50] we got to get in here together
[2:25:52] it's got to be in one accord one place
[2:25:54] settle down with one motive one thing
[2:25:56] then you're going to what
[2:25:59] see something happen now i want to go to
[2:26:01] possessing the enemy's gate stay with me
[2:26:03] just a moment we're nearly done not but
[2:26:06] we will be we'll make ourselves
[2:26:09] and i want you to hear what he said
[2:26:10] about the gentiles this is vitally
[2:26:12] important
[2:26:14] that the holy ghost fell on the gentiles
[2:26:17] this is our inheritance he said on the
[2:26:20] day of pentecost he sent down the holy
[2:26:22] ghost to continue
[2:26:26] are you here
[2:26:27] through the gentiles
[2:26:29] he'd been working through the jewish
[2:26:30] nation
[2:26:32] exclusively working through the jewish
[2:26:34] nation now on the day of pentecost he
[2:26:36] brings all these mixed groups
[2:26:39] they're all coming to the town
[2:26:41] and here this 120 they get the holy
[2:26:43] ghost they start wandering out in the
[2:26:45] street what is this are these men drunk
[2:26:50] it's just the um early hour of the day
[2:26:53] and and they're already drunk oh
[2:26:58] and peter he jumps up doesn't he say hi
[2:27:02] these men are not drunk as you suppose
[2:27:06] but this is that which was spoken of by
[2:27:10] the prophet joel that in the last days
[2:27:14] you know what you want to know when the
[2:27:16] last days began day of pentecost
[2:27:18] you know when the last days in when the
[2:27:20] bride goes out of here
[2:27:24] all of this church ages in between
[2:27:27] but thanks be to god he was using the
[2:27:30] gentiles to continue the work of the
[2:27:32] holy ghost he said on the day of
[2:27:34] pentecost he sent down the holy ghost to
[2:27:35] continue through the gentiles to take
[2:27:37] out a seed
[2:27:39] of promise
[2:27:41] are you
[2:27:42] listening
[2:27:44] he was taken out of people for his
[2:27:46] namesake
[2:27:47] from among the nations
[2:27:49] who
[2:27:51] you don't have to convert to judaism to
[2:27:53] be his
[2:27:57] he's taking out a people for his name oh
[2:27:59] hallelujah to give the gentiles the
[2:28:01] off-cast to give
[2:28:03] the off-cast that's who the gentiles are
[2:28:05] you know the
[2:28:07] to give them the baptism of the holy
[2:28:08] ghost to bring them into the promise if
[2:28:11] it had not been for the pouring out of
[2:28:13] the holy ghost you and i would have had
[2:28:14] no right
[2:28:17] to claim the promise but because the
[2:28:19] holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost
[2:28:21] he said now we have a right to conquer
[2:28:22] all sickness yes
[2:28:25] we don't have to conquer it it's already
[2:28:26] conquered we just have to claim the
[2:28:28] promise
[2:28:30] anybody here
[2:28:31] and go take it
[2:28:33] it's already conquered
[2:28:35] death is conquered hell is conquered
[2:28:36] sickness is conquered temptation is
[2:28:38] conquered i'm with him
[2:28:40] all devils is conquered hell is
[2:28:42] conquered death is conquered the grave
[2:28:45] is conquered
[2:28:46] we stand in the gate whoa
[2:28:48] the bride is standing in the gate
[2:28:51] taking
[2:28:52] it listen
[2:28:57] listen
[2:28:59] you don't have to fire a shot
[2:29:03] it's already been paid for
[2:29:06] [Applause]
[2:29:06] [Music]
[2:29:08] [Applause]
[2:29:13] here's the reason why i'm not ashamed to
[2:29:15] say
[2:29:16] that i'm a pentecostal by experience
[2:29:18] because here it tells us in the token
[2:29:20] 1964 the pentecostal they claim we're a
[2:29:23] pentecostal organization
[2:29:25] there is no such thing hey
[2:29:30] the prophet said it don't exist
[2:29:36] this is not the only place he says it
[2:29:39] they're illegally using the name
[2:29:44] and the devil has intimidated message
[2:29:45] believers from identifying themselves
[2:29:48] with the pentecostal experience
[2:29:50] because they've moved are so far above
[2:29:52] it
[2:29:53] i'm telling you they can't live the
[2:29:54] victory that the pentecostals are living
[2:29:56] anybody here
[2:29:58] are you still here
[2:30:00] they're not living any higher than they
[2:30:01] were that's all right i like it i need
[2:30:04] it sometime
[2:30:08] if you're looking at me to see how i
[2:30:09] respond go ahead
[2:30:12] i got time
[2:30:15] sometimes we need to get a little
[2:30:17] excited about something
[2:30:20] i don't want to take you back to some
[2:30:22] kind of pentecostal movement or some
[2:30:24] kind of pentecostal organization but
[2:30:26] there's no such thing pentecost is an
[2:30:29] experience
[2:30:32] it's not an organization i'll tell you
[2:30:34] without that experience you're in
[2:30:35] trouble
[2:30:37] he said they tried to organize it but
[2:30:39] you can't
[2:30:41] you see what happened when they started
[2:30:42] organizing around pentecost
[2:30:46] the holy ghost just stepped away
[2:30:50] he just leaves them
[2:30:52] and guess what they do they just keep
[2:30:53] right on talking in tongues
[2:30:57] it doesn't organize
[2:30:59] pentecost is and
[2:31:01] read it it's the seal of god
[2:31:04] pentecost is what
[2:31:06] it's a what
[2:31:09] you're gonna you're gonna have the seal
[2:31:10] of god and not have a pentecostal
[2:31:12] experience don't think so
[2:31:15] i'm sealed what do you seal by right now
[2:31:21] it's the seal of god the holy spirit
[2:31:23] that come on the day of pentecost
[2:31:26] anybody here
[2:31:28] and excuse me i'm not preaching to you
[2:31:30] here today i have to on occasion preach
[2:31:32] the vote put that back sweetheart uh
[2:31:35] josh's sweetheart
[2:31:39] not mine
[2:31:41] but we are in the south you don't josh
[2:31:43] everybody sugar
[2:31:47] my wife i've had to get over everybody
[2:31:49] calling me darling and honey and
[2:31:50] sweetheart when she moved from canada
[2:31:52] here and every waitress will call you
[2:31:54] that
[2:31:55] and now sometimes they'll sit down the
[2:31:56] table with you
[2:31:59] and we look at them like we're like
[2:32:01] we're aristocrats or something
[2:32:06] the slaves are sitting down with us
[2:32:12] take that out strike that from the tape
[2:32:20] at least you're laughing
[2:32:24] for you extremists out there
[2:32:28] who believe that everything before 63
[2:32:30] has been corrected
[2:32:34] i want you to notice this was
[2:32:36] february the 8th of what year
[2:32:40] 1964
[2:32:44] seals have been preached
[2:32:46] and here the prophet is saying it
[2:32:47] doesn't organize pentecost is an
[2:32:49] experience it's the seal of god the holy
[2:32:51] spirit
[2:32:52] that came on the day of pentecost i'm
[2:32:54] i'm with him
[2:32:56] i believe that
[2:32:57] anybody here
[2:32:59] he said there
[2:33:00] let's go on here
[2:33:02] he said there's no such thing that's it
[2:33:04] that's that quote let's go to the next
[2:33:05] one spoken word is the original seed
[2:33:07] just just to put in one more sentence
[2:33:09] here i think it'll help you spoken word
[2:33:11] is original seed the latter part of
[2:33:14] paragraph 35. you cannot organize
[2:33:16] pentecost
[2:33:17] can't do it you organize it the blessing
[2:33:20] leaves
[2:33:21] he said because it's an experience and
[2:33:23] now let me tell you what he's saying
[2:33:26] and what
[2:33:27] it's god
[2:33:29] [Music]
[2:33:32] excuse me this is 62.
[2:33:36] but something tells me is still very
[2:33:38] much real
[2:33:39] just quote before he calls it the seal
[2:33:41] of god
[2:33:42] and now he calls pentecost god
[2:33:48] and you're ashamed to be identified as a
[2:33:50] pentecostal and having a pentecostal
[2:33:51] experience when the prophet of god tells
[2:33:53] us that it's god the experience of
[2:33:56] pentecost it's not a church not an
[2:33:59] organization not a denomination but it's
[2:34:02] a manifestation of god
[2:34:05] this is that the same spirit that raised
[2:34:08] jesus from the dead is here to quicken
[2:34:10] our mortal bodies
[2:34:13] and then he goes on and says what and
[2:34:14] god cannot be
[2:34:17] can't be
[2:34:18] so you organize god moves
[2:34:21] and what are you left with an organized
[2:34:23] church
[2:34:26] they've got a lot more order than we do
[2:34:28] i understand
[2:34:30] they got their coffee shops
[2:34:32] and their favorite tattoo artist
[2:34:37] amen
[2:34:39] aim not all that stuff
[2:34:42] but the but the the word is clear here
[2:34:46] without without pentecost
[2:34:48] as an experience
[2:34:50] we're just a lodge
[2:34:52] anybody with me
[2:34:53] can i do one more two more three more
[2:34:56] good let me do this and real quick we're
[2:34:57] ending
[2:34:58] this is from the as the eagle stirs
[2:35:00] their nest since we had something to say
[2:35:02] about eagles paragraph 82 you'll
[2:35:03] recognize this you remember the first
[2:35:05] time god ever spoke to you how many of
[2:35:07] you remember
[2:35:08] first time god ever spoke to you oh

[2:35:14] you just might as well get started now
[2:35:16] oh my when i first heard his voice it
[2:35:18] spake like many waters
[2:35:20] oh my by the brook and stream were a
[2:35:23] rippling stream so he can lay down bathe
[2:35:25] and look up
[2:35:28] my he looked up and said what was that
[2:35:31] she'd come back over she said honey
[2:35:32] you're mine you don't belong in that
[2:35:34] place anyhow come out from among them
[2:35:37] and be ye separated saith the lord touch

[2:35:41] god to you i'll be a god to you you'll
[2:35:43] be sons and daughters to me see
[2:35:45] you don't belong to her that old
[2:35:46] organization that says the days of
[2:35:48] miracles has passed your mind
[2:35:51] somebody read that next thing to me
[2:35:53] your ego
[2:35:54] [Music]
[2:35:57] see oh that sounds good he said i
[2:35:59] understand that kind of talk yes sir
[2:36:02] why he was an eagle to begin with
[2:36:06] he actually he was actually an eagle he
[2:36:08] just got what he got the wrong nest that
[2:36:10] was all i hope i don't hurt you brethren
[2:36:12] but i'm just telling you the truth
[2:36:14] that's right many of them today
[2:36:20] [Music]
[2:36:27] i got jesus's picture here
[2:36:30] and brother branham's picture over here
[2:36:40] but have run any kind of pentecostal
[2:36:43] experience out the
[2:36:48] door hey somebody's in the wrong nest
[2:36:54] i said it
[2:36:56] somebody's in the wrong nest
[2:37:01] in the wrong nest huh mama is that what
[2:37:03] happened yeah you're my mama yes i'm
[2:37:05] your i'm your both father and mother
[2:37:07] sister brother i'm all in all to you
[2:37:11] that sounds good mama now mama
[2:37:13] what must i do this is the eagle talking
[2:37:15] back
[2:37:16] said i'll tell you honey
[2:37:18] [Laughter]
[2:37:22] i'm i'm winding down
[2:37:25] kylie did you tell your wife we go to
[2:37:27] church till two o'clock you should have
[2:37:29] told her
[2:37:33] said i'll tell you honey the way you got
[2:37:35] to do you just got to jump
[2:37:45] hey you got to just jump
[2:37:49] and get your feet off the ground
[2:37:52] there it is
[2:37:54] and then just go to flapping them little
[2:37:55] wings of yours
[2:37:59] just gonna flapping them as hard as you
[2:38:00] can you can rise
[2:38:05] cause you're an eagle see you got long
[2:38:08] feathers
[2:38:11] you got five primary feathers on the
[2:38:13] tips of both wings
[2:38:15] come on five
[2:38:17] and you can you can rotate those
[2:38:19] feathers you may not know it you may not
[2:38:21] stretch your wings in a long time but
[2:38:23] you have the ability god-given created
[2:38:26] ability to rotate those five primary
[2:38:28] feathers on the tips of your wings and
[2:38:30] it creates a centrifugal force
[2:38:34] that every mother eagle operates in
[2:38:38] because sometimes when she's kicked the
[2:38:39] little eagles out of the nest and
[2:38:41] they're learning to fly they get to eat
[2:38:44] and feeling their wheaties a whole lot
[2:38:45] sooner than they should
[2:38:47] and they wind up getting too far away
[2:38:49] from mother
[2:38:50] so mother is up here and little eaglets
[2:38:53] are flying down here and she looks down
[2:38:54] at them and sees them them little
[2:38:56] stinkers
[2:38:59] you teach them to fly and look they
[2:39:01] think they're grown
[2:39:04] so you know what she does god created
[2:39:06] her with this ability she rotates those
[2:39:08] five primary feathers like that
[2:39:10] and because she is so aerodynamically
[2:39:12] designed no bird is created or designed
[2:39:15] like the eagle
[2:39:17] she was so aerodynamically designed
[2:39:20] under her breast and her chest and out
[2:39:22] through her tail feathers that when she
[2:39:24] rotates them feathers like that that
[2:39:26] centrifugal force is created that
[2:39:28] catches those little baby eaglets that
[2:39:30] have gotten too far away from mother the
[2:39:32] word is nausea it's a prophetic word in
[2:39:34] greek i mean hebrew excuse me it's a
[2:39:36] prophetic word
[2:39:38] and it means to draw them up unto the
[2:39:40] breast
[2:39:44] which was a prophecy that god gave us
[2:39:45] here one time set the nations on your
[2:39:48] lap and draw them to the breast i've
[2:39:49] i've given you the milk to feed them
[2:39:51] with i've given you the food to feed
[2:39:53] them and other it goes on
[2:39:55] mama just shh
[2:39:57] rotates
[2:39:59] and those little baby iglets are sucked
[2:40:01] right up under mama's belly
[2:40:03] and she's scolding them good and proper
[2:40:06] i told you not to get that far away next
[2:40:08] time you better listen to mama
[2:40:11] now flapping them little wings of yours
[2:40:13] just flap them as hard as you can
[2:40:16] you can rise cause you're illegal see
[2:40:18] you got long feathers fly
[2:40:22] just jump off the ground start flapping
[2:40:24] your wings real hard
[2:40:26] i'll get you
[2:40:29] anybody here
[2:40:31] dead dry cold formal religion is that
[2:40:34] what you want
[2:40:36] said i'll tell you honey the way you got
[2:40:38] to do you just got to jump
[2:40:40] you got to jump and get your feet off
[2:40:42] the ground and then just go to the flap
[2:40:44] and then it'll wind yours
[2:40:47] it's real simple
[2:40:50] it's real simple
[2:40:53] isn't there more
[2:40:56] and he jumped up this little eagle
[2:40:57] coming out of them denominations
[2:41:04] you know the easter egg folks
[2:41:11] santa claus folks
[2:41:17] and give a great big flap four or five
[2:41:19] times
[2:41:20] and lit right on the barnyard post
[2:41:23] right in the middle
[2:41:26] of a pentecostal denomination
[2:41:28] but lifted right up above them
[2:41:30] and what you better not do is you better
[2:41:32] not hand out some of them books and
[2:41:34] tapes
[2:41:36] because they'll knock you right off of
[2:41:38] that post
[2:41:39] once they find out what you're doing
[2:41:42] you can't organize pentecost you can't
[2:41:44] denominate pentecost is an experience
[2:41:48] not an organization it's for you
[2:41:50] methodists you baptist you presbyterians
[2:41:52] how many glad to hear that god just
[2:41:54] calling anybody
[2:41:55] those that are his he's finding them
[2:41:57] wherever they are
[2:41:59] in their lodges and in their barnyards
[2:42:03] they try to draw fences around it but
[2:42:05] it's not so
[2:42:09] you read it for me would you eagles
[2:42:17] don't you go over there
[2:42:20] don't you go to alabama meeting don't
[2:42:23] you go don't you get mixed up with them
[2:42:26] folks
[2:42:28] don't you go all the way from arkansas
[2:42:31] to alabama on your only weekend off
[2:42:34] don't you do such a things as that why
[2:42:38] because everybody wants to keep
[2:42:39] everybody in the fence
[2:42:46] but not an eagle
[2:42:48] they'll just draw i'm gonna tell you
[2:42:49] they'll just get up high above the fence
[2:42:51] post and just go right over it
[2:42:53] sure they do don't pay no attention to
[2:42:54] it
[2:42:55] don't pay no attention to it eagles will
[2:42:57] fly right over how man tries to box you
[2:42:59] in don't you let man box you in in this
[2:43:01] hour don't you let your own ideas box
[2:43:04] you in you let the holy ghost lift you
[2:43:06] up above it
[2:43:07] now here's what we've got to remember
[2:43:08] and i may stop with this one why little
[2:43:10] bethlehem paragraph 92. here we go i
[2:43:13] know it's late
[2:43:14] how many of us in in it this morning how
[2:43:16] many is willing to forget your
[2:43:17] traditions how many is willing to forget
[2:43:20] your creed that disagrees with the word
[2:43:22] why ain't we got a revival
[2:43:24] why haven't we got these things going on
[2:43:27] good question
[2:43:29] what's the matter with pentecost
[2:43:32] it's organized itself that's it you
[2:43:35] can't
[2:43:37] organize pentecost you can make an
[2:43:40] organization but the pentecost is a
[2:43:43] blessing
[2:43:44] it's the power of god and if it's a
[2:43:47] genuine pentecost here's what you've got
[2:43:49] to remember it'll never bypass the word
[2:43:52] for a creed
[2:43:56] the holy ghost will never bypass the
[2:43:58] word to accept a creed it'll take the
[2:44:01] word
[2:44:02] right because it's circumcised from the
[2:44:04] world and the things of the world it
[2:44:06] sits only on the word of god and
[2:44:09] believes it we're in bethlehem
[2:44:10] candidates for the kingdom of god we're
[2:44:12] eating god's eternal life bread
[2:44:20] one more
[2:44:23] god give this one because this was where
[2:44:25] we kind of got our title
[2:44:28] this is uh
[2:44:29] the marriage of the lamb
[2:44:32] you'll be here tuesday night or stream
[2:44:33] in and we'll do the rest of these
[2:44:35] but paragraph 141 said now i think our
[2:44:38] organization does a good work that's all
[2:44:40] right
[2:44:41] see brother brandon was often asked to
[2:44:43] speak for the full gospel business men's
[2:44:44] fellowship and he often said that was
[2:44:46] the only organization that he carried a
[2:44:48] card with
[2:44:49] right
[2:44:51] i think our organization does a good
[2:44:52] work that's all right
[2:44:54] but you can't depend on that
[2:44:57] say i'm pentecostal
[2:44:59] because i belong to a pentecostal
[2:45:01] organization
[2:45:02] you're pentecostal
[2:45:04] you're pentecostal
[2:45:10] somebody said
[2:45:12] are you a pen you're out in the mall and
[2:45:14] someone says are you a pinnacle oh no
[2:45:16] i'm not a pentecostal
[2:45:24] said you're pentecostal when you get a
[2:45:26] pentecostal experience how many has a
[2:45:28] pentecostal experience
[2:45:32] and you're pentecostal
[2:45:36] i don't care if you belong to a catholic
[2:45:38] church you're a pentecostal
[2:45:40] if you've had a pentecostal experience
[2:45:43] you can't organize pentecost pentecost
[2:45:45] is an experience
[2:45:47] not an organization
[2:45:50] and that's right
[2:45:51] he said but we pentecostal people has
[2:45:53] begun to think because we have the name
[2:45:56] of pentecost we can go ahead and live in
[2:45:57] the world and do anything we want to
[2:46:00] he said we're like climbing nimrod's
[2:46:02] tower
[2:46:03] it'll go to ashes like adam's fig leaf
[2:46:05] apron she'll go back like the siegfried
[2:46:07] line in france the manual line in
[2:46:09] germany she crushed
[2:46:11] cause there's no other tower
[2:46:14] no other stand but the name of the lord
[2:46:16] is a mighty tower that the righteous run
[2:46:19] into it and are saying when you run into
[2:46:21] it you take the name the name not just
[2:46:23] calling a name but the name and the
[2:46:25] person that you are christ-like in the
[2:46:27] life amen wonderful he is yes
[2:46:32] church
[2:46:32] has done the same
[2:46:34] committing spiritual fornication as a
[2:46:37] woman that would share her love from her
[2:46:39] husband to another man oh this is
[2:46:41] getting serious that woman is not fit to
[2:46:44] be lived with
[2:46:46] you know that
[2:46:47] and when the church begins to share her
[2:46:49] fellowship with the world
[2:46:55] god is a jealous god
[2:46:57] he put israel away because of that
[2:47:01] now listen to this and his son will put
[2:47:03] the same thing
[2:47:06] away
[2:47:10] 145 he's going to have a bride
[2:47:13] that hasn't got a wrinkle in her amen
[2:47:16] she's holy w-h-o-l-l-y
[2:47:18] holy washed by the blood of his own self
[2:47:20] that's right so we see where we stand
[2:47:23] the wedding getting ready to come are
[2:47:26] you still here
[2:47:28] now we find out
[2:47:30] she commits spiritual fornications going
[2:47:32] out with the world professing something
[2:47:34] living something different that won't
[2:47:36] never work
[2:47:37] let me say again
[2:47:39] to everyone under the sound of my voice
[2:47:40] that won't never work what's the church
[2:47:43] ought to do what the church ought to do
[2:47:44] is do like esther did esther refused the
[2:47:47] adorning of the world
[2:47:50] that's very interesting that we would
[2:47:51] read this because shavuot the book of
[2:47:53] esther is a very important reading for
[2:47:56] shavuot time
[2:47:57] he said we know that little book of
[2:47:59] esther how that mordecai his uncle had a
[2:48:00] daughter and was down during the times
[2:48:02] of the reigns of the medes and the
[2:48:03] persians it's a very beautiful type
[2:48:05] there the king one of the greatest kings
[2:48:08] in the world that day he had a great
[2:48:09] feast and he called the queen to come
[2:48:11] and set by him but she wouldn't do it
[2:48:12] she refused to do it so what did he do
[2:48:14] he was so humiliated he didn't know what
[2:48:16] to do that his own wife wouldn't come
[2:48:19] i think that's a whole lot like christ
[2:48:21] today
[2:48:22] christ has invited us to eat in heavenly
[2:48:24] places with him and we're ashamed of it
[2:48:30] are you still with me
[2:48:31] good we're nearly done musicians would
[2:48:33] you like to come this way
[2:48:38] many people are ashamed to say
[2:48:42] that they got the baptism of the holy
[2:48:44] ghost who would ever thought we'd come
[2:48:46] to an hour
[2:48:47] where people would be ashamed to say
[2:48:49] they got the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:48:53] when i first received the baptism of the
[2:48:55] holy ghost at the age of seven
[2:49:00] i wanted to visit my granny one day and
[2:49:02] my granny was working in in her office
[2:49:05] doing income tax i'd had the holy ghost
[2:49:07] about a year
[2:49:09] and i wanted to come visit my granny and
[2:49:11] she wanted me to come because she would
[2:49:12] be free in the afternoon
[2:49:14] and she said to my mother would you care
[2:49:16] very much if i sent a taxi
[2:49:19] to pick up you could have probably done
[2:49:20] that without any worries in that day i
[2:49:22] don't know if i'd do that now or not
[2:49:24] but would you mind if i sent a taxi to
[2:49:26] pick up steve it was summertime and
[2:49:28] mother was working and
[2:49:31] she said no i wouldn't
[2:49:33] and i got a little nervous
[2:49:35] getting in this taxicab
[2:49:37] not quite eight years old yet
[2:49:40] uh
[2:49:41] or right at eight about to turn eight
[2:49:43] probably
[2:49:44] i got a little nervous
[2:49:46] about getting in that taxi cab with an
[2:49:48] old
[2:49:48] taxi cab driver a man i'd never met
[2:49:50] before and just all of a sudden it just
[2:49:53] dawned on me here i'm going off with a
[2:49:54] stranger and
[2:49:55] i watched the ways that he was turning
[2:49:57] to make sure he was heading toward big
[2:49:59] mama's house and
[2:50:00] looked like he was and
[2:50:02] i thought i got to get over my
[2:50:03] nervousness so he's i'm
[2:50:05] seven now
[2:50:06] i got to get over my nerve who is seven
[2:50:08] in here who who these kids are seven
[2:50:11] anybody
[2:50:12] we don't have any seven-year-olds got
[2:50:14] any six-year-olds
[2:50:17] how old are they
[2:50:19] six going on seven
[2:50:20] just pretend to be seven today
[2:50:24] so you just imagine putting millionaire
[2:50:26] in a
[2:50:27] taxi cab and sitting there somewhere
[2:50:30] i got a little nervous and i thought i
[2:50:31] got to get out of this nervousness so i
[2:50:33] said to the man guess what the lord did
[2:50:34] for me
[2:50:39] he said
[2:50:42] what'd he do i said he filled me with
[2:50:44] the holy ghost and fire and let me speak
[2:50:46] in tongues
[2:50:51] that man said well young man that's the
[2:50:53] best news i've heard in a long time
[2:50:58] then i said to him and you know what
[2:51:00] what he'll fill you with the holy ghost
[2:51:02] if you'll repent and be baptized
[2:51:09] he said i don't know son
[2:51:11] i've been a pretty wicked man
[2:51:13] i've done a lot of rotten things in my
[2:51:15] lifetime
[2:51:16] he said i've been overseas and i've i've
[2:51:18] fought in the war and i've killed men
[2:51:21] enemies of this nation
[2:51:23] and i don't know if god will forgive me
[2:51:24] i said sir
[2:51:25] god will forgive anybody that comes
[2:51:27] humbly and ask him to save him to
[2:51:29] forgive him of their sin i don't care
[2:51:31] what sins you've committed
[2:51:33] my lord will forgive you of your sins
[2:51:35] and save your soul and wash you with his
[2:51:37] blood and if you'll tarry long enough
[2:51:39] he'll fill you with the holy ghost and
[2:51:41] let you speak and done
[2:51:44] he said all i know is i want you to pray
[2:51:46] for me
[2:51:47] he said all i know is that so we get to
[2:51:49] the house and and uh my mama had left
[2:51:52] the money for me to pay the taxi cab and
[2:51:54] so the taxi man he gets out and opens
[2:51:57] the door for me
[2:51:59] i'm starting to get out he opens the
[2:52:00] door and he said uh young man do you
[2:52:02] mind if i come into big mama's house
[2:52:04] with you
[2:52:07] i said no sir don't you have to get back
[2:52:08] to work he said i can wait a minute or
[2:52:10] two
[2:52:11] and up the steps he come and he come in
[2:52:13] he said to my my granny said lady i just
[2:52:15] had to come and tell you
[2:52:18] this this this kid's a preacher
[2:52:20] he preached me under old time conviction
[2:52:24] he led me in a sinner's prayer
[2:52:26] and he's praying for me to receive the
[2:52:28] baptism of the holy ghost
[2:52:32] and my granny said well he's had good
[2:52:33] training
[2:52:35] and she said while you're here why don't
[2:52:36] we just pray again and she reached and
[2:52:38] put us
[2:52:40] [Music]
[2:52:41] i did i was not ashamed
[2:52:44] i didn't know that man i didn't know
[2:52:46] what he believed i didn't know what he
[2:52:48] thought about pentecost
[2:52:50] but i was not responsible for any of
[2:52:53] that
[2:52:54] i was not ashamed that he had filled me
[2:52:59] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:53:03] brother man said many people are ashamed
[2:53:05] to say they got the baptism of the holy
[2:53:07] ghost
[2:53:08] pentecostal people that's right they're
[2:53:10] ashamed to say it
[2:53:14] all right message believers
[2:53:17] what does he say next
[2:53:21] we're ashamed of him
[2:53:23] if you're ashamed of pentecost by
[2:53:25] experience
[2:53:26] you're ashamed of him
[2:53:28] is there more
[2:53:30] and so the queen wouldn't come she
[2:53:32] refused to come it humiliated him his
[2:53:34] face turned red everybody noticed
[2:53:37] he said i wonder if jesus face don't
[2:53:39] turn a little red too when he calls on
[2:53:41] us for a work
[2:53:42] calls on the pentecostal movement for
[2:53:44] fellowship and brotherhood and we're so
[2:53:46] tightly organized into little groups
[2:53:49] till we won't bend for the other he said
[2:53:52] we're so getting so worldly and things
[2:53:54] like that we're getting ashamed
[2:53:58] of the name
[2:53:59] of pentecost
[2:54:01] see i wanted to just bring a little
[2:54:03] balance here and say why i'm not ashamed
[2:54:05] to be identified as a pentecostal
[2:54:08] some people are afraid to say well i
[2:54:09] belong i'm a christian but
[2:54:11] he said i'm glad i got a pentecostal
[2:54:13] experience amen i'm glad to bear the
[2:54:16] name of jesus christ it's the greatest
[2:54:19] privilege i ever had to say i'm a part
[2:54:23] of him
[2:54:24] stand with me would you
[2:54:26] one more
[2:54:27] it's short
[2:54:29] it's from the church ages
[2:54:31] but you'll find brother branham saying
[2:54:32] this
[2:54:33] in other places
[2:54:35] but if the vine
[2:54:37] if the vine ever brings forth another
[2:54:39] branch of itself that branch will be
[2:54:42] exactly like the vine itself it will be
[2:54:45] the same
[2:54:46] kind of a branch
[2:54:48] that was brought forth when
[2:54:51] at pentecost it will speak in tongues
[2:54:54] hey
[2:54:55] [Music]
[2:54:56] prophesy hey
[2:54:59] and have the power and signs of the
[2:55:02] resurrected jesus christ in it why
[2:55:05] because it's thriving on the natural
[2:55:07] resource of the vine itself you see it
[2:55:10] wasn't grafted into the vine
[2:55:12] read that for me
[2:55:16] what was it
[2:55:19] born in the vine i'm going to sing one
[2:55:21] and then you i'm going to sing a little
[2:55:23] song and then benjamin's going to lead
[2:55:24] us in worship and we're going to see
[2:55:26] what the lord will do for those who want
[2:55:28] to come and receive a touch from him

[3:30:48] [Music]
[3:30:55] i pray
[3:31:00] [Music]
[3:31:06] how many of you are thankful
[3:31:08] for that wonderful peace of god
[3:31:11] i'm so thankful for it
[3:31:14] how many of you have ever felt it in the
[3:31:15] middle of a storm
[3:31:17] and he just come
[3:31:18] that wonderful marvelous peace
[3:31:22] now what god is doing for
[3:31:24] our brother elias
[3:31:26] we're giving god thanks for it
[3:31:29] he knew what he needed when he came
[3:31:31] he came determined today
[3:31:34] to meet the lord here
[3:31:36] to ask him for deliverance
[3:31:38] when i was praying over him i saw that
[3:31:41] it was generational and some of what
[3:31:43] he's dealing with has come down through
[3:31:46] generations but we're so thankful that
[3:31:49] once somebody catches a revelation that
[3:31:51] it don't have to be this way they raise
[3:31:54] up like he said like yesterday he sent a
[3:31:56] text and i'm determined
[3:31:59] i can't move
[3:32:01] out of my place until i get what i need
[3:32:03] from the lord and god's starting that
[3:32:06] he's starting that it's genuine it's
[3:32:08] real i sense the realness of it and once
[3:32:11] once somebody starts taking a hold of
[3:32:13] that it can stop
[3:32:16] when god blesses him with children
[3:32:19] and it doesn't have to keep moving down
[3:32:21] from generation to generation i'll tell
[3:32:23] you something else he can send it back
[3:32:25] up the line by the holy ghost
[3:32:28] he's got parents that need the lord
[3:32:31] he's got siblings that need the lord
[3:32:33] he's got family that needs more of god
[3:32:36] this is powerful when we get a hold of
[3:32:38] deliverance
[3:32:39] [Music]
[3:32:41] turn this mic up just a little bit i
[3:32:43] can't hear it
[3:32:44] i know they can we're closing
[3:32:46] but brother billy wanted us to pray over
[3:32:49] his daughter zion and her fiance
[3:32:53] solomon
[3:32:54] and they did such a wonderful job
[3:32:56] singing today
[3:32:58] i'm thankful for that it blessed us
[3:33:01] released a nice atmosphere in here
[3:33:04] we are not happy about zion moving away
[3:33:06] i'm not going to pretend like some
[3:33:08] people try to do i'm not going to
[3:33:10] pretend i don't like it
[3:33:12] i'm not sure it's god
[3:33:15] but it's not up to me
[3:33:17] it's up to him
[3:33:19] and so
[3:33:20] we're not going to withhold a blessing
[3:33:22] over this young couple we're going to
[3:33:24] send them out of here with our the best
[3:33:26] blessing we got
[3:33:28] to go and do whatever god would have
[3:33:31] them to do
[3:33:33] and uh but we're gonna whisper when they
[3:33:35] leave
[3:33:36] you've got a place if you ever need it
[3:33:38] i asked solomon we had a good talk this
[3:33:40] week
[3:33:41] and i said is there any chance that i
[3:33:43] might talk you out of taking her from it
[3:33:50] what'd you say solomon i i can't
[3:33:52] remember i had it in my mind and it
[3:33:53] slipped me
[3:33:54] probably not
[3:33:56] he said probably not
[3:33:58] well
[3:33:59] i liked that it didn't offend me i knew
[3:34:01] the answer before i asked the question
[3:34:04] but we love we love them both
[3:34:07] we love them both and we are thankful
[3:34:09] that they have found each other
[3:34:12] and i i won't know it'll never be easy
[3:34:15] there's always going to be that
[3:34:18] getting to know one another period and
[3:34:21] moving a new place and new schooling and
[3:34:24] new career and knew this and knew that
[3:34:26] but i tell you you can do it it's like i
[3:34:29] told them this week you can do it with
[3:34:31] him
[3:34:32] there's nothing that you all can't
[3:34:34] see accomplish with him
[3:34:37] so as our final
[3:34:39] spiritual demonstration here today we're
[3:34:41] going to ask them to come and we're
[3:34:42] going to pray over both of them with our
[3:34:44] love and blessing
[3:34:46] and we're going to look forward to
[3:34:47] getting to celebrate their wedding
[3:34:50] in uh

[3:35:22] they're going to be here for that
[3:35:24] wedding i don't blame them for that
[3:35:26] and we're believing that god's going to
[3:35:28] give them a beautiful time together so
[3:35:29] would you all come
[3:35:31] and let us pray over you as a
[3:35:32] congregation
[3:35:34] peace
[3:35:37] peace
[3:35:39] [Music]
[3:35:41] wonderful peace will somebody play the
[3:35:45] piano for sister laurel coming down
[3:35:48] from the father
[3:35:51] above
[3:35:53] sweep over
[3:35:55] sweep over
[3:35:59] my spirit
[3:36:02] forever
[3:36:04] i pray
[3:36:07] in fathom
[3:36:09] bless
[3:36:10] [Music]
[3:36:11] belows of love and while you're praying
[3:36:14] for them pray for solomon and his
[3:36:18] position in the church
[3:36:20] uh
[3:36:21] where's the town i know it's washington
[3:36:24] say it again
[3:36:26] ferndale washington where brother john
[3:36:28] andes is the pastor
[3:36:31] and solomon's do are you doing all the
[3:36:32] worship leading it's on you you're on
[3:36:34] your shoulders
[3:36:35] so we want to pray that god will anoint
[3:36:38] him
[3:36:39] and use him and take that congregation
[3:36:42] into a higher place
[3:36:44] of worship it can happen
[3:36:46] you just get a worship leader under the
[3:36:48] anointing
[3:36:49] either the preacher will preach better
[3:36:51] and the
[3:36:52] offering will be better and everything
[3:36:54] will be better
[3:36:55] that's a heavy position to carry
[3:36:58] so we want to ask the lord to do that
[3:37:00] for him as well
[3:37:01] father
[3:37:02] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[3:37:06] this is our precious sister
[3:37:08] lord that we have watched grow up
[3:37:11] from a tiny little baby
[3:37:13] and lord we have watched her life
[3:37:17] and we've watched her victories
[3:37:19] and we've watched the enemy's attacks
[3:37:22] but we are thankful today that you have
[3:37:25] kept her
[3:37:26] by your grace
[3:37:28] and by your spirit
[3:37:32] and lord we indeed believe
[3:37:35] that you have brought them to this place
[3:37:38] today
[3:37:39] with one another
[3:37:42] lord and they are committing everything
[3:37:45] they have
[3:37:46] and everything that they are to your
[3:37:48] servant
[3:37:49] lord i thank you for that
[3:37:52] and and though we didn't know solomon
[3:37:54] his family not a stranger to us
[3:37:57] for we worshiped
[3:37:59] wonderful times together with his
[3:38:01] grandparents and days gone by
[3:38:04] and so lord
[3:38:06] we already have a connection
[3:38:08] in the spirit
[3:38:10] you've allowed them to
[3:38:11] find one another
[3:38:14] and there was no talking her out of him
[3:38:16] or no talking him out of her
[3:38:19] that's a good sign
[3:38:21] they have endured these last years
[3:38:23] waiting just waiting
[3:38:25] to get a little old enough get a little
[3:38:27] older
[3:38:28] and get the uh backing
[3:38:31] of both sets of parents
[3:38:34] and the blessing of her father
[3:38:37] and now lord all of that is in place and
[3:38:39] the arrangements are being made every
[3:38:41] day
[3:38:42] for a wonderful celebration of their
[3:38:44] union
[3:38:45] and i know their thoughts are on those
[3:38:48] wonderful things but today lord my
[3:38:50] thoughts
[3:38:51] are on
[3:38:52] their gifts and their callings
[3:38:55] and what you have placed in them
[3:38:58] for the body of christ
[3:39:00] and now lord our brother is he leads
[3:39:02] worship
[3:39:04] and steps up into that position
[3:39:07] oh god let us
[3:39:09] let his voice be anointed
[3:39:12] with the sound of heaven and let his
[3:39:15] thoughts be directed by the holy spirit
[3:39:18] and
[3:39:19] oh god give him the right songs
[3:39:22] let him catch the inspiration
[3:39:26] the same inspiration that falls on the
[3:39:28] preacher
[3:39:29] lord let him catch that even before the
[3:39:32] word goes forth
[3:39:34] to help prepare the hearts of the people
[3:39:38] lord use him
[3:39:41] for your glory
[3:39:42] i pray o god that anything
[3:39:45] that would remain in them resisting
[3:39:48] your voice or your direction
[3:39:51] or any deliverance that would be needed
[3:39:54] in their life lord granted
[3:39:57] come
[3:39:58] by the power of the holy ghost and fill
[3:40:01] them so full of your life
[3:40:05] that wherever they go and whatever they
[3:40:08] do they just impart
[3:40:10] the life of jesus christ
[3:40:13] so we call the enemy's plans defeated in
[3:40:16] the name of jesus
[3:40:18] and we bless them in the name of the
[3:40:21] lord jesus christ
[3:40:23] to follow the leadership of the lord
[3:40:26] as they come together to be one in you
[3:40:29] lord may they remember every day that
[3:40:32] they cannot make it without you
[3:40:35] they but with you all things
[3:40:38] are possible and available to them

[3:43:52] things she didn't want to be a teacher

[3:44:00] and teacher for our children
[3:44:02] we uh
[3:44:05] got a
[3:44:06] robot for the pool

[3:44:11] vacuuming the pool
[3:44:14] and uh we got this thing to do it for
[3:44:16] her
[3:44:17] and and the ladies laughed at us in
[3:44:19] there
[3:44:20] when we were talking to one another they
[3:44:22] heard us and they were laughing and
[3:44:24] and i just had to tell them you don't
[3:44:26] understand she does so much more than
[3:44:29] that
[3:44:30] for all of us and never complains
[3:44:33] i want you to just give her a little
[3:44:35] appreciation and let let her know with a
[3:44:37] little clap that you love her

[3:45:12] it keeps coming back
[3:45:13] but i know that the lord is able
[3:45:16] the last little
[3:45:18] uh test she had was a little little
[3:45:20] worrisome
[3:45:22] and uh but we are just believing
[3:45:25] that there's just nothing to it
[3:45:27] but would you ask the lord to dissolve
[3:45:29] it and let it pass from her body
[3:45:32] lord right now while the faith is here

[3:45:43] our faith together right now and ask you
[3:45:45] to drive out from her body anything
[3:45:49] that the enemy would try to place there
[3:45:51] to worry her or to hinder her or affect
[3:45:54] her in any way
[3:45:56] and we command it in the authority of
[3:45:58] jesus christ dissolve and pass from her
[3:46:01] body you are a trespasser
