Description:
We have to keep throwing our faith anchor into the realm of the unseen and take that as our absolute. What we are living in is not the reality in its fullness. Eternity is a reality in fullness.

We are fighting a spiritual battle and we must wear our spiritual armor in order to make it through. We must create an atmosphere around us. When we do that, we then have eyes of faith to see we will win this battle and become possessors of the unseen things!
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Jesus received a change of clothes he laid aside the glory but he shared with the father it's at the appearing of the Lord Jesus Christ it's your faith and it's been tried by the fire would be worthy well done he chooses to see what he saw about me that's mercy my love His grace take your place and take it now your family is at stake it's never too late for a man of integrity to go before God on behalf of his children [Music] [Music] he-man turn in your Bibles if you will please - oh my where shall I go read with me John five chapter and five and verse 19 and 20 then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things soever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise but the father loveth the son and show with him all things that himself doeth and he will show him greater works than these that ye may Marvel that's powerful isn't it let's read that one again for the father loveth the son and show if him all things that himself doeth and he will show him greater works than these that she may Marvel and now little sisters if you would give me verse 30 of the same chapter I'd like to read John five thirty I can of mine own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just because I seek not mine own will but the will of the Father which hath sent me can you say Amen these are the words of Jesus he is our supreme and ultimate example in all things I think that most of us would readily admit admit that we say too much and do too much that the father the Spirit of God within us is not leading us to do we would all be better off waiting on the nudging z' of the Lord do you believe that how many of you believe he lives that close to you right inside of you that he can nudge you and speak to you and lead you if you're willing to be led let's pray father you are so wonderful and so faithful to your children we have nothing to murmur about we have no complaints this morning because you are just and true I thank you Lord for walking with your children and I thank you for living in your children this is the promise of the Holy Ghost we need you this morning do for a few minutes let us dismiss all of the other worries and concerns and thoughts of our present life and for a little while Lord would you anoint every one of us to be able to pull in faith upon your word that you might speak a word to us in season something that we could anchor our soul to something that would direct our footsteps this week we take authority over every spirit of darkness that opposes the revealing and shining of the great light of God that lives in the people of God he would like to distract this morning but we thank you for the power by Jesus to rebuke that spirit and send it on its way we invite the glory cloud presence of God to come in this room and settle our nerves and settle our emotions and let us feast upon the Living Word of God Lord we ask it in the name of our Messiah Yeshua in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and the Saints said a man you may be seated the last time that we were together in the word we were talking about what a supernatural God we serve how many of you serve a supernatural God I serve a supernatural God and I find that we as human beings have a tendency to limit God by our own thinking what we think he can do or what we think will happen or what we have maybe seen in the past and we just figure it will always be that way but I want you to know we serve a supernatural God who is above and beyond anything you and I could imagine and get ahold of this human finite mind right now it's not big enough to get a hold of the concept of who God really is but one day as we stand in his presence he will continue to unveil his glory to us and we will know more about him over there than we have known about him over here but he is revealing himself to his people by his word in these last days do you believe that because when it comes we're going to know him we're going to recognize him and it's not going to be by signs and wonders only because we know that there is a false amen it's not going to be my feelings because we know that we can have a lot of feelings how many of you have ever felt good one minute and ready to die the next feelings have nothing to do with faith and so there is something on the inside of us that has a connection to God that cannot be broken he's given us the gift of faith and faith is an anchor we've just got to keep throwing our faith anchor over into the realm of the unseen into the dimension of the supernatural into that spirit realm that the Bible tells us so much about and let our anchor drop over there in the unseen and take that as your absolute you see this is not reality in that something to say this is not reality in its fullness reality in its fullness is beyond the curtain of time reality in its fullness is in the realm of eternity thank God every one of us have a measure of eternity living inside of us by eternal life eternal life is a portion of eternity it's a seed of eternity that's been planted in every believer who has been baptized with the life of Jesus Christ if you're thankful for that measure of eternity in you you ought to thank God we ought to praise Him right now that he has not left us here in this world to grope around in the darkness not knowing that there's something more real than the realm we live in brother Branham talked about this being the negative that being the positive what we are looking at is like the old days when we used to get our film developed and we couldn't hardly wait because by the time we got around to getting it to the drugstore we forgot what was on it did that ever happen to you what if I told you I saw the other day in the battery drawer three rolls of undeveloped film I don't have any idea what's on them sister Joyce said send them off so you can see but if you will remember you would get your little packets of I remember when they first offered to give us a disc they print your photos and then they give you a disc so you can put them on your computer and we thought we were really in the jetsons days you know and now you don't even fool with all of that you just take it and you got it it's there and what in the world did Mariah want the other day but a Polaroid camera who wants to go back but anyway you'd get your prints and then in a tiny little sleeve you would get these little strips of negatives and you my they seem to multiply they fall out of the package the envelope and you're trying to figure out what envelope to put them back in I want you to see that should have brought some for your Millennials I told one of the nurses this week you Millennials and she really got a big kick out of that because there's so much that they don't know anything about you say oh but what they know about is so much better I don't know if it's all better or not but anyway I still would like to know history wouldn't you and where people have been anybody that doesn't know what a telephone booth is I think they've been hiding out playing video games too long least you should know what it is even if you've never seen it phone booth it's not complicated but you get those negatives I want you to see those in your mind if you have ever had any that is where we're living you can get an idea of what the the film was developed to be everybody kind of looks skeletal all the face details were not so good you could usually look at the size of the person and figure out who they were hush or the size of their hair and figure out who they were got you back but you couldn't tell everything about it you think you got it but you really didn't know what light had struck until you saw the print that was really the best image of reality close as the camera technology in that day would allow reality to be captured and then that's just a print of reality but this is a good analogy that brother Branham talked about because we can see that strip of negative that is where we are living and yet we put so much on that which matter so little when what really matters is over yonder in the unseen realm oh if we can get ahold of that and live in that realm while walking through the negative if we can keep our spirit reaching out for what is over there in our eternal promise while we're going through difficulties down here I believe God will help us maintain our praise you can maintain your praise no matter what you're going through this morning if you'll reach your faith over there into that unseen realm and say Jesus that is more real that is more real than what I'm walking through this morning it really is that is reality in fact brother Branham preaching on these subjects many years ago for those of you who don't know he was a mighty prophet of God that was used one generation ago to help deliver a message to prepare an endtime people for the Lord Jesus Christ many great men of God made their contribution to Christianity as it is today but I'm so thankful for that scriptural contribution that he made very thankful and I'm not ashamed at all to mention his name because it what I heard over there what I learned if by the Spirit in hearing some of those sermons it has certainly molded me in and helped me to understand the Word of God gray gaps and great mysteries that we can now understand because Jesus has revealed himself my what a blessed people we really are to be able to get a good picture a full picture and he said to a fellow one time when they were talking the man said you know I don't believe anything that science can't prove he said well you know what my philosophy is different than yours he said if if science can prove it I don't I don't really believe it I know that's a pretty strong statement I'm just telling what he said he said what I really believe in its what science cannot prove because it's supernatural and yet I believe it how many of you are not ashamed to be identified with a group of people who believe things that cannot yet be scientifically proven you see they're angels in this room this morning I can't prove that scientifically but I can prove it by the word so I believe that divine healing is the children's bread I may not be able to prove that scientifically this morning but I can prove it by the word and what I've seen God do for many many many many many of us through the years so you've got to believe what you can't see your faith has got to be willing to take God at His Word no matter what the report is no matter what the doctor says he's able he is able now just let me mention this before we move on to where we want to go this morning the word supernatural it means above and beyond the natural this is the realm where God operates he moves from that realm the unseen realm and he moves in the realm of the seen the atmosphere around us and in our present time in the frame of time God moves but he doesn't move from time to eternity he moves from eternity into time one of these days time will be no more that's going to be a glorious day isn't it the supernatural realm is around where heaven and earth intermingle it is the realm of interaction between God and man we're really caught in to that other realm any time God touches us physically we remain over here but spiritually we are caught up does that trouble anybody because the Apostle tells us in the New Testament I read it last time we were together I think in 2nd Corinthians 12 verses 1 through 5 about a man caught up into that third heaven and heard things that were not lawful to be uttered I don't think his physical body went anywhere but that part of him that was God's it moved into that other realm of the supernatural and he saw things that had never been seen by human eye I don't believe Paul was the last one to have that experience and I believe that more of us would have interaction with that realm if we would attach our faith to what is unseen and that we would keep speaking the Word of God and the promises of God over and over again no matter what it looks like or what it feels like turn with me this morning to Ephesians chapter 6 this is a familiar portion of Scripture and verse 10 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of his mind I want you to know that strength is not dependent on your human strength when you feel like you can't put one foot in front of another there is another strength I want you to help me there is another strength that we can move in but it's not automatic it just does not fall on us automatic so what do we have to do brother shellye what we have to do is when we realize that we've gone as far as we can go in our human strength in that moment we have to consciously make a decision by faith to reach over into that unseen realm how do we do that by speaking God's Word now Lord you said now Lord it is written here Lord I believe your Lord says and when you speak that you are attaching faith to it it is a confession amen and your spiritual confession according to the word has power to shift the atmosphere around you that's not metaphysical that's good old Bible if we have the spirit to help us read it and understand it you have to take a moment and say now Lord I've gone as far as I can go how do you know so much about that I got a lot of practice Lord I've gone as far as I can go today and I can't go any farther in my own strength I feel like my sanity is slipping away like my strength you've got to come as you promised you said Lord and you just start spewing it out greater is He that is in me than he that is in the world Lord you said you wouldn't allow me to suffer more than I would be able to stand under you said that in those moments you would not only be there you would undergird me and lift me up you not only said I could lead on you as the everlasting arms but you have provided a tower of refuge and strength and you just start speaking what you know somebody said what good does it do if momentarily disconnects you from your natural circumstances I somebody said here standing here maybe it's brother Greely who said something about our faith being what was his words energized that's what happens when your faith gets weak somebody said I don't have enough to get over there in the unseen realm you don't need a whole lot you just have to use what you've got you've been given the measure required just use whatever little bit of faith you have and say Lord I take you at your word let me see let me feel let me hear just a moment of what it's like over there in that unseen realm the realm of the Spirit the realm of truth the realm of thus sayeth the Lord are you following me this morning you know he goes on put on the whole armour of God that she may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood by my mind someone said to me recently I will do my best not to tell you the details and circumstances of the situation someone said to me recently it began to feel like a spiritual conflict how do I know where the Shelly if what I'm going through is a spiritual conflict are you going through it is it touching your life is it a part of your present circumstance and reality than its spiritual somebody said I don't know if you can make a blanket statement like that you can as soon as you begin to realize who you are and that not only are you serving a supernatural God but you indeed our supernatural bride very natural and very supernatural all at the same time is that who we are and so anything that comes up in your life there's going to be at least a spiritual element attached to that situation don't be a fanatic don't be a you know a spiritual ghost Buster looking for a demon under every rock just be wise be mindful of who you are but know that the enemy would like to take advantage of everything you face to trip you to distract you to pull you in a wrong direction to make a life decision or choice that would alter your future and cause you to veer off the course of God's ordained destiny plan for you so everything that touches you but let me let me say it like this if it touches you it touches God I need some scripture for that cast that doesn't mean you know just casually it means we're not talking about cane pole fishing we're talking about casting kind we're talking about putting some effort and getting it out of my hand you and me cast all your cares somebody said I could I really need a new pair of tennis shoes it better not be none of mine saying it I think they just got something didn't they maybe it feels that way anyway doesn't it now I'm not going to bother the Lord with that all right just go right against the scripture if you want to but if that's a care and concern maybe you need them maybe you're not just trying to be fashionable someone sent me a leak and I had a lot of time it didn't have my laptop with me that day read the Bible and did everything else I knew to do while mama was sleeping and I followed that link and it is something like preachers and sneakers and it showed pictures of all the famous preachers in America and how much they pay for their Sonique errs well I didn't know my shoes was so cheap I've always thought my shoes were expensive I didn't know you could have sneakers $3,500 repaired $7,000 a pair and I know I'm not jealous over those sneakers but most of us we don't we're not asking for another pair like that we just need a pair to walk in right and we'd like for him to look cool forgive me Lord for saying that word I hate it if you've got a need God cares if there's something you care about God cares about it cast all of your cares on me he said for I care for you so God does care he is concerned about whatever it is that we are going through and the war that we're fighting is not against human beings it's not against the IRS it's not Democrats against Republicans it's certainly not African Americans against Caucasians this war is much larger than that this is a wrestling match between principalities powers rulers of the darkness of this world spiritual wickedness in high places it's not just the Jezebel in the church spirit Jezebel spirit in the church you've got to be concerned about but you got to be concerned about the one that sets in government because that spirit of control is alive and well we do what we can naturally to combat that but we must understand that this is a battle that is not between just people this is a spiritual battle spiritual wickedness in high places how do we prepare ourselves for a spiritual battle I don't even think I don't even know I'm in well I didn't even realize I was in one well there's your problem right there you've been in one all along and you didn't even realize that's where you were that means you had nothing to go against it you had nothing to counteract you had nothing to fight with because you didn't even know you were in a spiritual war but you are because you're a blood ball sanctified Holy Ghost field child of the Living God and hell hates you Satan wants to destroy you ten millions of demons want to destroy your life you're in a spiritual battle whether you've been fighting it as one or not the quicker you understand that you may think you're just getting by and you're off the radar you are not off the radar you are targeted in this hour for great pain and anxiety targeted but you've got an answer o have an answer I have a remedy I even have something proactive I don't only have to move defensively but God has provided an offensive plan for my life and Ephesians 6 tells us what it is stay with me he said we're four verse thirteen take unto you the whole armour of God you know this that she may be able to withstand in the evil day is this an evil day huh you think this is the evil day it is and until Jesus comes tomorrow's going to be more evil than today yes we're surrounded by darkness that's why we've got to shine with everything that's within us that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith mine what does the shield protect it protects some pretty vital organs of your body doesn't it including your heart how many of you know you can't live long without a heart that's working properly so God gives us faith to protect ourselves in those vulnerable areas stand there for your loins Girt about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God praying always with all power and supplication in the spirit and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints God has provided a an armor a spiritual armor for you to wear you really believe that well I didn't put it on this morning well it might be a good idea for you to remind yourself that you have an armor before you go out and face reality but I want you to know it's mine and if I don't remember to put it on I got it you see the thing about my armor is it's unseen and since it's unseen it doesn't disturb me when I sleep so I don't have to take it off to go to bed put it on when I get up in the morning unless that's just a discipline that you you like to do I know people have done that I've even done that at different times in my life wake up read the scripture and say now today Lord I need the breastplate of righteousness I need the helmet of salvation today but because your supernatural people who serve a supernatural God the armor of the Lord is on you even though it is unseen it should be unseen it's from the unseen realm it's from the dimension of the supernatural if you're still with me say man let me give you some quotations here the have been helpful to me one is from a message called it wasn't so from the beginning he said now we find our Lord then in his work that he claimed to do nothing of himself only what he seen the father doing he gave all praise to God thing that was unnatural supernatural every armour that we have brother all of our armor is supernatural he said what about the fruit of the Spirit love faith love joy peace long-suffering meekness gentleness patience he said now you go down to the drugstore and buy me a quarters worth of patients he said I need it I felt that way this week buy me five dollars worth of love he said I could stand a lot of that he said see that's not how it works it's the unseen something that's our whole armor we stand listen we stand in the unseen world looking at the unseen things yet to us we see them yet to us we see them because our faith detects them and our faith says it's there you hear that so if I should ask you do you have on the helmet of salvation why do you need something on your head you've got something pretty important up there that needs to be protected it needs to be constantly revealed the work of redemption in our thoughts is not something that is you know finished and we never have to grow in that our thoughts are daily being redeemed if we present them to the Lord Lord you know I don't want to think Fath that is not how I want to spend my day thinking like that I'm asking you to come and give me grace over these thoughts I want to think from another realm I want to get my inspiration from another dimension you mean you really take the time to we better because how many of you know you can wake up feeling okay and it can be all downhill from there and you don't have to face any new reality any new situation just start rehearsing the old one the things you've been going through it gets bigger and bigger and heavier and heavier and you are totally unaware that in that moment of turmoil and in that moment of pain in that moment of feeling completely forsaken you are laying there or standing there with the whole armor of God on it's there you just have to be aware of it and receive it by faith you activate it by faith your feet shod with the preparation of peace the sword of the Spirit the Word of God is given us for a weapon here's what we need to understand let me give you this in the amplified and we'll move on for a little while longer second Corinthians chapter four and verse eight in the amplified zowie second Corinthians chapter four since we consider and look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen for the things that are visible are temporal brief and fleeting why is it that something can feel so final it seems that in our thought process we can look at a particularly desperate problem and decide in our minds their will there's no room for two it's always been this way and it will always be this way if you ever felt that way I know you have because you're human beings this will never pass this is my lot in life it'll always I'll always be misunderstood nobody will ever get me you can really get bogged down in something and decide that it is always going to be this way when the scripture tells us we are not looking to things that are seen but to the things that are unseen for the things that are visible are temporal brief and fleeting but the things that are invisible I want to make sure you hear that invisible can't see faith you can see faith in action but you can't see faith you can see love in action but you can't see love you can see joy and demonstration but you can't see joy but how many of you know Joe is real you believe joy is real you believe faith is real you be love is real but you can't see it you can if you know where you're looking you're looking in faith to the unseen realm and that is the eternal existence not what you're going through right now I like that song they used to sing it didn't come to stay it came to pass our problem is we don't we don't often know how long it's going to be here and with God comforts us he often says something like it'll be better soon how many of you get nervous when God says soon my soon and my suddenly doesn't always line up with God soon and God suddenly but here's another man that he should lie neither the son of man that he would have need to repent if God said it it's settled brother sister you just got to hold on to it with everything you've got listen to this we have to train ourselves were to look not only do we have to train ourselves what to think we have to train ourselves where to look we have to make a spiritual conscious faith-filled effort to choose to look beyond the scene to the unseen realm of faith with men things are impossible but with God how many things all things are possible how many of you know of some things in your life or in the lives of somebody you love that seemed to already have the ending it just seems final it has to be this way most of us could think of something in our life that feels very finished but I want you to know God has a track record of doing the impossible when somebody dares to believe all things are possible we just train ourselves where to look our flesh nature will always turn to the natural circumstances that surround us you agree with that statement but we have another nature his spirit in us eternity in us joy life of God in us and that other nature will often remind us and provoke us to look to the other realm the reality of the supernatural unseen realm how many of you have ever had the Holy Spirit of God in your moment of despair just finger you just tap you somehow I guess it's really up here isn't it and all of a sudden you think of this maybe maybe you think of but God I hear what you say demo but you don't get the final word I'm not just looking at what I see I'm looking to the unseen realm I serve a supernatural God I'm a part of a supernatural bride that he's building in these last days I'm going to take him at his word he goes on let me let me share another quote sir we would see Jesus this is a very powerful sermon and it leads to some very powerful events that took place a generation ago he said in the whole Christian armor now is unseen the Christian looks at what he doesn't see natural now look that's the only way you can be a Christian you've got to believe God who you can't see he said watch here the whole Christian armor and he talks about the fruit of the Spirit love joy peace longsuffering so we take those as part of the armor he said see all those things are unseen but the things that unseen the things that are unseen are the ones that have the reality the un-- seen things listen to this calling Jesus on the scene he said you can't make yourself believe have you ever tried that's why atmosphere is so important I want to talk to you this a minute if you listen to me that's why atmosphere is so important because unless you're in a certain spiritual environment you will never be able to make yourself believe for certain things but when you get in that realm when you start worshiping the Lord when you start lifting up his name in your grief in your pain in your loss whatever's going on you feel like you want to pull your hair out don't do that it'll come out soon enough leave it in you feel like you just can't move forward and in that atmosphere entertaining those thoughts you will never be able to make yourself believe that God is about to rescue you but you just take a moment of time and say Lord excellent is your name your promises are yeni man you are the most faithful God all of your ways are just and righteous and holy and true you have made your people precious promises now music helps me to get in that atmosphere I was built that way and perhaps you were when I get under something that's inspired music that's inspired it doesn't always have to be my particular like and dislike if there's inspiration on it if it's from the Word of God it helps me move up a little higher no matter what's going on but you'd be surprised what kind of atmosphere I could build frustration will vanish it will just start dripping away when you start hearing things that remind you of who you serve and who lives in you and who is helping you you're not alone he's with you so if you're not in that atmosphere of inspiration of spirit it's impossible to make yourself believe but in that atmosphere in that realm faith is a sixth sense you hear what I'm telling you faith is a sixth sense it operates very similar to your other senses it requires stimulation inspiration see something hears something feel something experience something remember something and all of a sudden your faith level gets what was the word again energized you start lifting up out of your natural circumstances he went on to say it's a quality you can't make yourself believe it's a quality that's in you faith is the substance that's Hebrews 11:1 he said not just imaginary it's the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things that you believe and you don't see but you still believe them and all the whole Christian armor now remember every bit of it is by faith it is all supernatural it's all unseen things the Christian armor the Christian always looks at things that he does not see in that funny he looks at things that he does not see I don't know how much logical sense that makes but it makes a lot of sense to me it's really a paradox we can't see it with this eye but we can see it with a spiritual eye an eye of faith said God said it it's settled I'm gonna hold on to that are you with me we're getting ready to close I wish that it was all automatic but it's not we can't make ourselves believe but we can get in the right atmosphere and turn our faith loose how many of you know that Abraham found a God the scripture says that that God that Abraham got ahold of was a God that called things that are not as though they are that was the God he got ahold of and getting ahold of a God who calls things not as they are but as they should be it's why Abraham had faith to hold on to the promise every evidence that Abraham could see and could know and could discern said your your days are done but the promise of God said you're gonna be a father again and God made that possible at a hundred years old didn't he so it's important to remember something like that listen at this demonology is the sermon it comes from he said the whole armour of God is by faith we haven't got one natural thing of this world look at this armor and he gives the fruits of the spirit again love joy peace longsuffering goodness meekness gentleness patience he said is that right everything's supernatural nothing natural so we don't look at the natural because we're operating supernatural oh my I serve a supernatural God and I'm called to be a people a part of a people who operate in the supernatural and the only way we can base it is by faith faith on what God said was the truth and we look to the unseen and we call those things which are not as though they were like Abraham did being a hundred years old staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief even though he tried to help God out a little bit he still believed the promise that he was going to be a father he had more confidence in what he was going to do than what God was gonna do for Sarah did you notice that now this is a little lengthy so I'm gonna read this in closed its from possessing all things he said oh my how I I locked that it's a believers promise what's that got to do with us he said to every believer the believers promise is eternal life the believers promise his life joy peace longsuffering gentleness patience fruits of the spirit divine healing a dozen things I got wrote down here that is your possession it belongs to you but you cannot have it until you fight for it see it's not automatic first Timothy 6:12 in the amplified says fight the good fight of the faith lay hold of the eternal life to which you were summoned and for which you confessed the good confession of faith before many witnesses you've got to fight for it he said well they say let me get some scientific research and see if if that'll just sink in he said now they could probe around on that but he said I'm an heir to that science can try to figure it out but I have a promise as an heir to that he said then I'm also an heir to things that can't be seen unseen things I'm an heir to that every believer is an heir he's an heir to that to the unseen possessor of what what does the scripture say heaven and earth what a promise it's in first Corinthians and I'll close with the scripture first Corinthians 3 verses 21 through 23 King James 1st Corinthians 3 21 through 23 therefore let no man glory in men read the rest read it out loud can we believe such a promise whether Paul or Apollo's or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come read those last three words and here's how we know that's true this verse let's read it out loud every one of us at will and ye are Christ's and Christ is God's can somebody say I'm in good hands I belong to Christ he he when he was here in earthly form he said I can't do anything but what I heard of the Father I've got to see it or hear it of the father I'm not here to do my will I'm here to do the will of him that sent me did you understand by scripture that you have the same inheritance this is what the scripture said everything Christ inherited from his eternal spit from thee let me start over everything Christ inherited from the eternal spirit of the Father we are entitled to by election and by his precious blood price that's who we are but one of the Prophet is saying here and it's all ours we have a right to claim every bit of it as our possession as our inheritance he said they asked him said brother Branham what about out there where you can't see he said how do you know he said that's still mine heaven belongs to me he said I'm glad and God said so well you've never seen it how do you know it's there he said I know it's there because God said so how do you know you're an heir to it if you've never seen it he said because I believe God's Word I'm an heir you're an heir with me we're all heirs together through Christ Jesus and this wasn't a prophet just taking license to tell us something that wasn't in the word we just read it from the word you belong to Christ Christ is in the hands of his eternal spirit of the Father led by him he said all that the father was he poured into the son and all that was in Jesus Christ he poured that out upon the head of the believers on the day of Pentecost you and I have that same inheritance we're not waiting to get it we're waiting to recognize it we're not waiting for it to be deposited we're waiting on faith to rise to the level to activate and use what has already been given to us by God's Word it's more than just changing your mind I believe in the power of thinking right but it's more than that it's shifting everything about the way you allow your thoughts to go and shifting everything back to being very very conscious of the Word of God and the God who lives inside of you I want you to know that church anity will never overcome in Satan's Eden a go to church once a month kind of walk with God we'll never survive in what's coming just around the corner you see it you see a building you feel it building there's an agenda it's no longer in the shadow it's among us it's a warfare Satan is out to destroy he wants to touch your home he wants to touch your family come on you let somebody touch your children and see how your feathers get you and I ought to be that way about every promise that's ours when the devil tries to talk us out of it not just the fruit of our body we ought to be just that zealous over every promise that God has given us in this life I desperately want to get to a section of this on who we are as the supernatural people but would you stand this morning have you ever asked the average person to try to explain the relationship between the father and the Son and the Holy Spirit I've discussed with some pretty learning folks at times and you know what the explanation is at best confusion and when you say do you does that make sense to you they say oh well it's not meant to make sense it's the mystery of the Trinity well the Bible says the mystery should be finished something's missing you have an understanding by the grace of God given to you by the Holy Spirit because you can read in the book and you can hear sermon on tape and not get it but when God gives you the Holy Spirit inspiration to receive a truth that becomes a revelation in you I want you to know I believe that one mystery is a key I do so important the final mystery cry is the mystery of God revealed right from the word the bride of Jesus Christ is Christ revealed the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed we hear that and it's just a little phrase that we pass around that's life-changing it changes everything I read an article that someone wrote yesterday and when I was finished reading it I said Lord please forgive me but if that's who you were I could not serve you I could not follow a God who is that weak and it was written by modern theology written really against the sovereignty of God putting you and I in more control than the God we serve I want you to know I can't serve a god weaker than his enemy the God that you and I serve is the Ancient of Days his knowledge and wisdom and understanding go all the way back before time and he knew then much of what we're walking through today he knew it way back then that's why we find this scripture that talks about whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundations of the world what a promise what a mystery that nothing that happened in the Garden of Eden took God by surprise nothing that happened in Calvary took God by surprise nothing that happened in the dark ages took God by surprise and nothing that happens in your life today is going to catch God by surprise he has seen it all every one of your days are written in his book before you were ever born he knows your good choices and your bad choices and yet knowing everything there is to know about us he loved us
