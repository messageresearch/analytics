[0:00] but I'm the happiest
[0:03] when I know that I have placed my head
[0:05] on his chest
[0:08] and he has put his arm around my
[0:10] shoulder and Drew me to himself
[0:20] when you say I'll be a friend to Jesus
[0:23] you sing the old hymn I'll be a friend
[0:25] to Jesus
[0:27] when you talk about knowing him and
[0:30] following him and loving him I'm not
[0:33] talking about thumbs up thumbs down
[0:36] Harding liking following influencing I'm
[0:41] not talking about anything like that I'm
[0:43] talking about becoming progressively
[0:46] more deeply and intimately
[0:50] acquainted with him I wanna know what
[0:55] causes his heart to beat fast I want to
[0:59] know what causes his heartbeat to slow
[1:02] down I want to know what he loves
[1:05] because I want to love what he loves I
[1:09] want to know what he hates because I
[1:11] wanna hate what he hates
[1:15] I want to know him
[1:18] in in the most intimate
[1:23] the
[1:24] non-presuming assuming way
[1:27] where the rubber meets the road we're
[1:30] going to have to come to a place where
[1:32] we mean it
[1:33] to have him to have his favor
[1:36] to have his pleasure
[1:39] to know that I've done something to know
[1:42] that I've said something that pleased
[1:44] him
[1:46] wow you think how tragic it is and
[1:50] painful it is to recognize that we have
[1:52] disappointed him
[1:55] and then you think about how joyous it
[1:57] is
[1:59] how strengthening it is to know
[2:04] pleased
[2:05] but I'm the happiest
[2:08] when I know that I have placed my head
[2:10] on his chest
[2:13] and he has put his arm around my
[2:15] shoulder and Drew me to himself
[2:19] it's the life of a believer
[2:22] we have to get over this kind of a
[2:24] concept
[2:25] I want to become intimately acquainted
[2:27] with him and this is not something dirty
[2:30] it's not something vulgar it's to be to
[2:32] become so in tune
[2:36] so in Union so in Oneness
[2:41] with what he wants
[2:44] Moses said
[2:47] I want to know your way
[2:50] thank you
[2:50] [Music]
[2:53] Paul said something more powerful than
[2:55] that
[2:58] I want to know you
[3:00] [Music]
[3:04] I don't want to just know what you can
[3:06] do
[3:08] I don't want to just love you because of
[3:10] what you are capable of doing
[3:13] I Just Want to Love You Because of Who
[3:15] You Are
[3:17] you are God Sovereign and supreme
[3:21] you're a God who in in my mind should
[3:25] have no desire or reason to have
[3:27] fellowship with me
[3:29] and yet it's a priority
[3:34] you desire to have fellowship with me
[3:38] he'll come to where you are to save you
[3:41] but you'll have to come to where he is
[3:42] to have Fellowship who can Ascend the
[3:45] hill of the Lord
[3:46] but he that has a pure heart and Clean
[3:48] Hands and it's so easy it's so easy to
[3:51] get your hands washed it's so easy to
[3:54] get your heart pure you just come to the
[3:56] word
[3:58] and you just realize that that it's not
[4:01] how clean you can get your hands
[4:03] it's not about that at all it's about
[4:06] understanding what he's done on your
[4:08] behalf
