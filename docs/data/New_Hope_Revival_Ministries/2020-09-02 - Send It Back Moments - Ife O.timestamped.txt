[0:00] but he's waiting for you to come into
[0:02] agreement with him
[0:03] and lay it back on the accuser
[0:13] but all young people older people
[0:15] middle-aged people i am
[0:17] telling you the blood of jesus christ
[0:20] has been shed as the atonement and it's
[0:23] standing between you
[0:24] and the wrath of god
[0:27] it is there between you and the wrath of
[0:30] god and that blood
[0:32] wipes the sin away and i'm telling you
[0:35] today
[0:38] the sin that you committed yesterday
[0:42] in the mind of god it's already bleached
[0:44] out
[0:46] but he's waiting for you to come into
[0:48] agreement with him
[0:50] and lay it back on the accuser
[0:53] lay it back on the accuser the dirty
[0:56] devil
[0:57] wants to keep you all bound up in
[1:00] guilt and condemnation and shame to keep
[1:03] you from moving forward
[1:05] he wants to keep you in a pit but hey
[1:08] we're just gonna lay it back over on the
[1:10] devil today
[1:12] and just keep it on him because
[1:16] he is the father of lies
[1:19] he wants to pour out his wrath on you
[1:22] and he wants you
[1:23] to carry some of what he has to carry
[1:27] he wants you to be in a place where that
[1:31] you're bearing
[1:32] something that you don't have to carry
[1:36] you don't have to you know why you don't
[1:38] have to because jesus christ
[1:40] already did and the fact was
[1:45] that i was in him that day at calvary
[1:49] and i already bore it once
[1:52] [Music]
[1:53] now that may be a little over the top
[1:55] for some people
[1:56] but i've come to the understanding that
[1:58] i was in him
[2:00] that day at calvary i was in him
[2:03] therefore i was in him
[2:05] when his visage was marred and it was
[2:08] hard to tell who he was
[2:10] i was in him when he was carrying all of
[2:14] my sin and condemnation
[2:16] i was with him when i he was carrying
[2:19] all of my
[2:20] deepest darkest ugliest secrets that
[2:23] there were
[2:24] i was in him therefore i'm telling you
[2:27] once again
[2:28] you better have confidence in the holy
[2:31] ghost that lives inside of you
[2:33] if i say i am born again of the spirit
[2:36] of god
[2:37] and the blood of jesus christ has
[2:39] cleansed me from all of that stuff
[2:42] then i can come into agreement with the
[2:44] word of god the revealed word of god
[2:47] and say i don't have to carry that
[2:49] anymore
[2:50] you can accuse all day long if you want
[2:53] to
[2:54] but i'm just keeping it right back on
[2:56] you
[2:57] and you're going to have to carry all of
[2:59] these accusations with you
[3:01] to the lake of fire you've got to carry
[3:05] them with you to the day of judgment
[3:07] friends as the bride of jesus christ
[3:10] gets closer and closer
[3:12] to the day of that catching away and she
[3:14] recognizes
[3:15] more and more who she is and that she
[3:18] doesn't have to walk
[3:20] under guilt and condemnation she doesn't
[3:22] have to walk under grief and anxiety and
[3:25] sorrows
[3:26] and the transgressions of the past and
[3:28] the iniquities of the past
[3:30] she doesn't have to walk under any of
[3:32] that and the enemy
[3:34] continues to accuse you and you continue
[3:37] to heap it back on his head
[3:39] i tell you we're going to walk in such
[3:41] exalted victory
[3:43] of the lord jesus christ
[3:47] [Music]
