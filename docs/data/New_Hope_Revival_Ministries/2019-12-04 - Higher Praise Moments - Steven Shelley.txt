TRANSCRIPT
========================================
high praise is giving up above what you feel and what you see praise in God's house and out of God's house it's not just the responsibility of gratitude but it also becomes a weapon and we could talk all day long about scriptures in the Old Testament concerning Judah and concerning God's strategy to win a battle and how many of you know sometimes it has nothing to do with men it's military power it had nothing to do with strategic wisdom we're gonna meet it with worship and how many of you know every time we read of something like this happening in the Bible it brought such a confusion on the enemy he is not expecting you to give God exuberant praise in the heat of the battle he's expecting you to whine and moan and groan and lick your wounds but if you will resist the enemy and not let your circumstances affect your praise you'll absolutely Drive the enemy into confusion and not just your ordinary praise your weekly effort of praise but something above and beyond what you would normally give you send the message into that spiritual darkness you send a message that says I'm going to keep God forefront in my life and my focus is going to be on his goodness no matter what's going on around me praise creates an atmosphere for God's power to show up you need an example shackles fell off in the midst of praise prison doors automatically in the midst in the atmosphere of trees and it was high praise how do you know as high prints because it was praise that was not affected by what they were going through at the moment that's high praise high praise is getting up above what you feel and what you see and what you're going through and giving God not normal praise or your regular praise but high praise God I want to give you tipsy praise loaded praise I want to give you shrill praise come on I want to give you a sacrifice I want to raise up my praise we're praising the Lord because he's good because he's righteous come on because he's true and what happens is we just start amping it up a little bit you just start pushing a little harder because you begin to feel the lift and when you begin to feel the lift you push a little farther into high praise and then power begins to move come on it's it's like the power twins they're operating one off from after another high praise brings a demonstration of power power brings us into an atmosphere of higher praise and it just keeps moving
