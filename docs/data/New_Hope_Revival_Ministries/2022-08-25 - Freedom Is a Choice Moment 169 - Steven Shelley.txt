Description:
Freedom and deliverance is a choice.  It takes a made-up mind to fight the enemy toe to toe daily until we come to a place in Christ where we overcome the pulls of darkness and come to total deliverance and remain free.  God will strengthen our decision to be victorious and free from condemnation and guilt.  Never forget His grace and mercy, and always remember the hand that reached way down and pulled us out.
