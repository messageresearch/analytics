[1:09:07] there there's one thing I want to say
[1:09:08] about her there's a lot of good things
[1:09:10] to say but one is she's she's a little
[1:09:12] bit like me in the sense that she's
[1:09:14] afraid there won't be enough so she does
[1:09:16] her share and and several other people
[1:09:19] share I don't think it would hurt if we

[1:13:08] the very created blood of God blood that
[1:13:12] was created specifically for the purpose
[1:13:15] of redemption bow your head just a
[1:13:17] moment father in the name of Jesus

[1:13:30] a message in this that must be heralded
[1:13:34] today I I can't do it without you lord
[1:13:38] for me to try and not depend on you

[1:13:45] futility I need you to come Lord and
[1:13:49] help me to get out of the way so that
[1:13:52] you can speak to your people anoint our
[1:13:55] ears to hear your word today may we
[1:13:59] everyone make a decision those who are
[1:14:02] streaming this service if time would
[1:14:05] permit I would mention names and
[1:14:08] countries for there are truly people
[1:14:11] tuned in with us this morning from
[1:14:13] around the world may every person under
[1:14:16] the sound of my voice make a decision
[1:14:19] today to arise and to awake to shake
[1:14:24] ourselves like never before and to loose
[1:14:28] ourselves from every bondage from every
[1:14:32] yoke that is upon our shoulder may we
[1:14:36] exercise uh uh in the in this service
[1:14:39] our faith that the anointing might come
[1:14:43] and not only break the Yoke but that
[1:14:46] every yoke would be destroyed we ask for
[1:14:50] your help today we are a needy people
[1:14:54] there are desperate needs represented in
[1:14:57] this house today come Lord Jesus is our
[1:15:01] prayer we ask for your help in the name
[1:15:05] of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his
[1:15:08] glory alone and the saint
[1:15:11] said can you say it a little louder a
[1:15:14] little stronger you may be
[1:15:19] seated in Ghana you have to pray for for
[1:15:23] Benjamin and I because we we have quite
[1:15:26] a transition to make when you are with a
[1:15:30] people like that so hungry for for the
[1:15:33] things of God and so dedicated to
[1:15:36] worship it's not that we want you to be
[1:15:39] African we want you to be who God made
[1:15:42] you but please have a little compassion
[1:15:44] for us because we come from that
[1:15:47] atmosphere and we come back to the
[1:15:49] United States where where people take
[1:15:52] for granted what they have not just
[1:15:55] they're monetary but they're spiritual
[1:15:58] they take it for granted they take the
[1:16:00] anointing for granted they take freedom
[1:16:02] to worship for granted and so it's quite
[1:16:05] a transition to make and not only
[1:16:08] physically but also mentally and
[1:16:10] emotionally so we thank you for your
[1:16:12] prayers we are reading a very familiar
[1:16:16] portion of scripture today we are
[1:16:19] reading about the captive Daughter of
[1:16:23] Zion this is not a new message that that
[1:16:26] I'm bringing to you this morning this is
[1:16:29] something that God laid on my heart so
[1:16:31] heavily some years ago and I I I I
[1:16:35] couldn't begin to describe to you the
[1:16:37] night I had last night after I left here
[1:16:40] I I was just in in the night I was in
[1:16:43] travail and a and in turmoil because I
[1:16:46] knew there were some who had come to
[1:16:48] received their need met of the Lord and
[1:16:51] had left disappointed and when when you
[1:16:53] realize that then you carry it you know
[1:16:56] a little bit in intercession and if I
[1:16:59] told you the dreams that I had you would
[1:17:01] think I'm a crazy man I had an encounter
[1:17:05] with a giraffe last night in a dream you
[1:17:07] know and somebody said that couldn't
[1:17:09] have been spiritual but it was it really
[1:17:13] was
[1:17:14] spiritual a and then the illegitimate
[1:17:16] secret son of a pastor came and served
[1:17:20] me a meal and while he laid food on my
[1:17:23] table the Lord spoke to me who he was
[1:17:26] and and it was my responsibility to
[1:17:29] expose his identity no one would want
[1:17:32] that job would they and so one one one
[1:17:35] dream after another dream and an
[1:17:37] intercession in between and I think
[1:17:40] that's why the song meant so much to me
[1:17:42] today is because when you deal with
[1:17:44] something and you don't know how to pray
[1:17:47] and you just yield yourself and
[1:17:49] sometimes it comes out like a groan or a
[1:17:51] moan and people look at you like you're
[1:17:54] crazy they don't understand the
[1:17:56] intercessor life but I'm so thankful
[1:17:59] that God does I'm so thankful that he
[1:18:02] hears and answers prayer he not only
[1:18:05] moves according to the words that come
[1:18:07] out of our mouth but he sees the need of
[1:18:10] our heart when we can't articulate it
[1:18:13] when our vocabulary is insufficient and
[1:18:17] we don't feel like that we can express
[1:18:19] ourselves to the Lord aren't you glad
[1:18:22] that he the Holy Ghost comes and he
[1:18:25] cries out to God on our behalf and he
[1:18:28] gives us strength he gives us strength
[1:18:31] to keep pressing on we cannot survive on
[1:18:37] emotion it's going to take more than an
[1:18:39] emotion to get us through to the last of
[1:18:42] the last days we're going to have to be
[1:18:44] a noo people not a feel so not a h so
[1:18:49] not a think so we're going to have to be
[1:18:52] a no so people we're going to have have
[1:18:54] to know that we know that we know how
[1:18:57] strong and mighty our God is and we're
[1:19:00] going to have to trust him that he is
[1:19:03] able to do exceedingly abundantly above
[1:19:05] that which we could even ask or think if
[1:19:08] you believe that say amen amen turn the
[1:19:11] monitor down just a tad because it is a
[1:19:14] why don't you stay up there please and
[1:19:17] turn that down just a tad uh I've turned
[1:19:20] it all the way around but it's a little
[1:19:22] bit of an echo and I don't mean to be
[1:19:24] grumpy but we've come home to a brand
[1:19:26] new sound system it sounds like and so I
[1:19:29] I I want it to be I don't want to
[1:19:31] disturb anybody with the volume or with
[1:19:33] the echo uh I want to make it as as easy
[1:19:37] for you to hear as possible but I don't
[1:19:40] want to strain my throat either I want
[1:19:41] to want to do the best I can so what we
[1:19:44] were reading this morning is about
[1:19:47] Isaiah's
[1:19:49] Vision Isaiah was probably one of the
[1:19:52] greatest prophets of the Old Testament
[1:19:55] we don't like to compare the ministry of
[1:19:57] prophets we're not Catholic and we don't
[1:20:01] we don't necessarily believe in Major
[1:20:03] Prophets and Minor Prophets we
[1:20:06] understand that that is something that
[1:20:08] that the Catholic Church did and a and
[1:20:11] King James bought into that and so
[1:20:14] Isaiah and Jeremiah and Ezekiel are
[1:20:16] usually considered Major Prophets
[1:20:19] because their books are
[1:20:22] bigger and Hagi and Micah and Malachi
[1:20:26] are usually considered Minor Prophets
[1:20:29] because their books are smaller aren't
[1:20:31] you glad God is not judging you on the
[1:20:34] size of your
[1:20:36] book uh your calling is what matters but
[1:20:40] if we were to look at the ministry of
[1:20:42] Isaiah we would say that he has
[1:20:44] prophesied some of the most important
[1:20:47] and profound things concerning the the
[1:20:51] the life of of Israel the the life of
[1:20:56] the Jewish people he was not only a NABA
[1:20:59] prophet he he not only received uh uh uh
[1:21:04] words uh the the word nabba is a Hebrew
[1:21:08] word that that sort of means a gurgling
[1:21:11] forth and and so the spirit of the Lord
[1:21:14] would fall on Isaiah at times he would
[1:21:18] open his mouth and the word of the Lord
[1:21:20] would just kind of gurgle out un
[1:21:23] unrehearsed
[1:21:25] unplanned he he didn't know what he was
[1:21:27] going to say he just opened his mouth
[1:21:30] and God would speak isn't that a
[1:21:32] wonderful thing but he was also a
[1:21:34] Visionary Prophet I'm up here he W he's
[1:21:38] a Visionary Prophet a Seer Prophet which
[1:21:41] means he would sometimes see Visions
[1:21:44] there would be pictures that would form
[1:21:46] in the eye of his spirit and he would
[1:21:50] describe in prophetic utterance what he
[1:21:53] was seeing in the spirit and in Isaiah
[1:21:57] 52 he is describing to us a Visionary
[1:22:03] experience where he came upon the
[1:22:06] captive Daughter of Zion which is the
[1:22:09] nation and the spiritual Gathering
[1:22:12] Together of Israel we would call them
[1:22:15] the Jewish people but we understand that
[1:22:19] that Israel in the Old Testament is not
[1:22:23] just God dealing with his his Nation but
[1:22:26] it's also for example the New Testament
[1:22:29] tells us that everything that happened
[1:22:32] to Israel happened for a lesson to us as
[1:22:36] New Testament Believers we can look at
[1:22:39] the wonderings of the children of Israel
[1:22:43] and we can learn much in the New
[1:22:46] Covenant from what they experienced in
[1:22:49] the old Covenant if you understand that
[1:22:53] I'd like to hear you say amen am and so
[1:22:56] we are we are looking at what Isaiah saw
[1:23:01] concerning the condition of Israel but I
[1:23:04] want you to know it's a parallel because
[1:23:07] it's not only Israel that has Fallen
[1:23:11] Captive to her enemy but even the New
[1:23:14] Testament Church and even a portion of
[1:23:17] the elected predestinated bride of Jesus
[1:23:21] Christ Has Fallen Captive to to bondages
[1:23:26] to to traps to unbelief when we were in
[1:23:31] Pentecost everything was a sin I I grew
[1:23:35] up in in a Holiness environment and
[1:23:38] there were people unsure if you should
[1:23:41] consume caffeine and some preached you
[1:23:44] should women should wear head covering
[1:23:47] and some preached it was wrong for women
[1:23:50] to wear head covering and some would say
[1:23:53] a woman shouldn't wear a a pointed
[1:23:56] collar her collar should be round and
[1:24:00] others came and said no she shouldn't
[1:24:02] have a collar at
[1:24:05] all and some said a woman ought to ought
[1:24:08] to cinch her belt she should have a belt
[1:24:11] and pull her waist in and others would
[1:24:13] say no she should never wear a
[1:24:18] belt and then denim jumpers came
[1:24:23] out and some said that's
[1:24:26] ungodly because that reminds you of a
[1:24:29] man's
[1:24:30] coveralls and and I've told this story a
[1:24:33] thousand times but you need to relax so
[1:24:36] I'll tell it just one more time preacher
[1:24:39] came and preached for my granny and and
[1:24:42] he preached against coca colola and
[1:24:46] caffeine now mind you he would enjoy a
[1:24:49] big piece of chocolate
[1:24:52] cake which also has
[1:24:55] caffeine but he didn't want a a
[1:24:58] cocacola well my grandmother was driving
[1:25:01] 70 something miles every night and
[1:25:04] working during the day to have Revival
[1:25:07] down on Highway 10 in lore Alabama and
[1:25:11] this was the preacher she chose many
[1:25:13] times through the years I asked her is
[1:25:15] that the best you could do a preacher
[1:25:17] like that and she said I guess it was at
[1:25:20] the time so he had brought a fiery
[1:25:24] message message on the evils of drinking
[1:25:27] cocacola and and I wouldn't have cared
[1:25:29] if he' to preached that long as he
[1:25:31] didn't preach on Dr Pepper I would have
[1:25:33] been all right wouldn't have bothered me
[1:25:34] at all and he's just preaching away and
[1:25:37] she got so sleepy on the way home she
[1:25:40] said I thought I was going to go in the
[1:25:42] ditch and so she said I turned to the
[1:25:44] preacher and his wife in the back seat
[1:25:46] and I said I hope you won't be offended
[1:25:50] but she said I've got to stop here at
[1:25:52] the little store and and take a little
[1:25:54] refreshment and see if I can get
[1:25:56] something to drink that will wake me up
[1:25:59] and he said no no we understand she said
[1:26:01] now I know you you you preached on Coca
[1:26:04] colola tonight she said but I need a
[1:26:06] little something with a little caffeine
[1:26:08] or I'm going in the
[1:26:11] ditch and he said oh don't worry about
[1:26:13] it sister Shelly he said my wife and I
[1:26:15] will take a Double
[1:26:19] Cola well most of you don't even know
[1:26:22] what a Double Cola is but but a Double
[1:26:24] Cola was Double
[1:26:27] Cola it wasn't size but it was double
[1:26:30] caffeine so he wasn't against caffeine
[1:26:33] at all he was just against a
[1:26:36] brand if it' been Pepsi he would have
[1:26:39] drank it isn't it amazing how
[1:26:45] crazy come on I know people Shun from
[1:26:48] their church because they decided to
[1:26:51] change the color of their window shade
[1:26:56] isn't it amazing how crazy we can get
[1:27:00] how many of you are glad for the message
[1:27:02] of
[1:27:03] Grace how many of you are glad this
[1:27:05] isn't about our performance on a Geral
[1:27:08] wheel but this is about obedience to God
[1:27:11] and receiving Redemption through the
[1:27:13] blood of Jesus Christ we want to live a
[1:27:17] separated life but we don't ever want to
[1:27:20] trust in what we do or do not do to save
[1:27:24] us salvation is not of works it's Grace
[1:27:29] it's by grace that we are saved it is
[1:27:33] the gift of God none of us could be holy
[1:27:37] enough to be saved it's not your
[1:27:41] Holiness it's not my Holiness it's his
[1:27:46] Holiness that's going to preserve us
[1:27:49] it's his Holiness that's going to help
[1:27:51] us to get through do you believe that
[1:27:55] so Isaiah is
[1:27:57] experiencing a Visionary experience
[1:28:01] where he happens upon uh the captive
[1:28:04] Daughter of Zion it's one woman but she
[1:28:09] represents a nation of people and we
[1:28:12] know women represents the church the
[1:28:15] prophet has showed us that throughout
[1:28:16] the scripture here She lays she is
[1:28:21] bruised she's bloody she has been
[1:28:25] ravished I hope you will forgive me for
[1:28:29] the plainness of my language she has
[1:28:32] been
[1:28:34] raped Israel had been raped her enemy
[1:28:40] had forced himself on her just like
[1:28:45] preachers have raped the Bride of Jesus
[1:28:49] Christ by forcing their opinions on her
[1:28:53] instead of giving her the fullness of
[1:28:55] the
[1:28:56] word ripping out pieces of the message
[1:29:01] that they don't like
[1:29:03] anymore going back to Babylon back to
[1:29:07] Easter
[1:29:09] Bunny back to Easter basket back to
[1:29:13] Santa Claus back to the Christmas tree
[1:29:17] because preachers have ripped it out and
[1:29:20] they have left her in confusion but
[1:29:23] don't you worry about her her
[1:29:26] Deliverance is in her own
[1:29:28] mouth Hallelujah for the word of God is
[1:29:33] nigh under her even in her mouth she's
[1:29:38] not waiting on a preacher to bring her
[1:29:41] her Deliverance she recognizes sh she
[1:29:47] recognizes that the word is already in
[1:29:50] her and she has a responsibility
[1:29:54] to awaken herself to shake herself out
[1:29:59] of the
[1:30:00] Dust to recognize that her Word of
[1:30:04] Deliverance has already come she doesn't
[1:30:07] need a preacher to have a vision about
[1:30:10] her she needs to rise up to awake out of
[1:30:14] her sleep to put on her strength to tear
[1:30:18] off her bloody muddy Rip Torn soil
[1:30:23] garment
[1:30:24] and be dressed in the Royal Robes of his
[1:30:29] righteousness she chooses to take off
[1:30:34] those clothes that are carrying the
[1:30:38] residual of
[1:30:40] Babylon you see Babylon has Stained the
[1:30:44] garments of the
[1:30:47] church
[1:30:48] Babylon three Gods improper baptism
[1:30:54] tongues as an Evidence come on Amen even
[1:30:59] doctrines that have come along and said
[1:31:01] things like a woman can cut her hair as
[1:31:04] long as she wears a head covering you
[1:31:07] ought to know better than
[1:31:10] that you ought to know better than that
[1:31:14] that Prophet cried out under the
[1:31:16] inspiration of the Holy Ghost keep the
[1:31:22] scissors out of your hair because once
[1:31:26] you start using those things it is a
[1:31:29] slippery slope that's
[1:31:33] right and so they put it in a little
[1:31:35] twirl and cover it up because they don't
[1:31:38] want people sometime to know what
[1:31:41] they've been doing preachers have come
[1:31:43] along instead of preaching righteousness
[1:31:47] they've told women well you can cut the
[1:31:49] front because you don't know what to do
[1:31:51] with it and you can do this you can do
[1:31:53] that in the other but you know the
[1:31:54] little bride isn't looking for an easier
[1:31:58] way this this Daughter of Zion she's not
[1:32:02] looking for an easier way she's looking
[1:32:05] for God's way it's too late I want
[1:32:09] somebody to hear what I'm saying to you
[1:32:12] it's too late to compromise now we're
[1:32:16] too near the
[1:32:18] end oh hallelujah our final Redemption
[1:32:23] is in sight who wants to slack up now
[1:32:27] this little bride doesn't want to slack
[1:32:29] up she wants to run on she wants to
[1:32:32] climb she realizes that God has been
[1:32:35] mighty good to her but she wants more
[1:32:39] she's still crying out more Lord more
[1:32:43] Lord more Lord Isaiah's
[1:32:46] broken his heart is
[1:32:49] crushed he sees this beautiful prince
[1:32:53] prin of Zion he sees her and he
[1:32:58] remembers her former Beauty he
[1:33:01] remembers how radiant she used to be
[1:33:05] stay with
[1:33:06] me he remembers how radiant she used to
[1:33:09] be how graceful she used to carry
[1:33:13] herself her hair glistened in the Sun
[1:33:16] and her clothes spoke of
[1:33:20] royalty a and uh her strength was to be
[1:33:24] admired you read The Song of Solomon and
[1:33:27] you hear the description of this
[1:33:30] beautiful woman and you you realize that
[1:33:34] somehow God is using the inspiration of
[1:33:38] Solomon to describe the beauty of his
[1:33:41] own wife the wife of the Lord the Bride
[1:33:45] of the Lord we're living in an hour now
[1:33:48] where there's a transition that must
[1:33:50] take place between bride and wife
[1:33:56] the Bible said that her his wife hath
[1:34:00] made herself ready and uh that woman is
[1:34:04] not his wife until she has entered into
[1:34:08] intimate relationship with him and the
[1:34:11] same way you you God has no
[1:34:14] grandchildren you can't be born into the
[1:34:17] message you're not ready for Rapture
[1:34:20] because daddy believed the message or or
[1:34:23] Mama believe the me there's no second
[1:34:26] generation or third generation pass but
[1:34:29] every individual must have their own
[1:34:33] experience with God and they must
[1:34:36] receive their own revelation of this
[1:34:40] truth when you get a revelation of this
[1:34:43] message it doesn't matter to you how
[1:34:45] many articles are written against it it
[1:34:48] doesn't matter to you how many family
[1:34:50] members Fall by the wayside it doesn't
[1:34:52] matter how many people leave the church
[1:34:55] for greener pastors once you've got a
[1:34:58] revelation of this truth you realize
[1:35:01] that it'll take you all the way because
[1:35:04] it's not the revelation of the voice of
[1:35:06] God Jeffersonville it's not the
[1:35:09] revelation of William
[1:35:11] brandham that's not going to make it
[1:35:13] folks it's only the revelation of Jesus
[1:35:17] Christ him in plain view he's no longer
[1:35:21] hiding behind the lattice but he has
[1:35:24] stepped out from behind the lattice and
[1:35:28] the bride is beholding his face Isaiah
[1:35:32] he remembers how this captive Daughter
[1:35:35] of Zion once carried herself he
[1:35:37] remembers her beauty now lost her dress
[1:35:41] is torn her face is smeared she carries
[1:35:46] shame she's she's blushed with shame
[1:35:50] she's laying there a victim
[1:35:55] she's
[1:35:57] wallowing in her
[1:36:01] victimhood she's had many opportunities
[1:36:04] to get up that's
[1:36:06] right somebody said what about that band
[1:36:09] around her neck we'll get there she's
[1:36:12] had many opportunities to save herself
[1:36:16] she's had many opportunities to awake
[1:36:19] and to arise Out of the Dust to shake
[1:36:22] herself and do what the what verse two
[1:36:25] says loose loose yourself I want to say
[1:36:30] again
[1:36:31] loose
[1:36:33] Yourself Loose yourself it didn't say
[1:36:35] run to the preacher and he'll loose
[1:36:38] you come on now wait for the
[1:36:43] Evangelist and he'll loose you wait till
[1:36:46] your pastor comes to pray for you and
[1:36:49] he'll loose you but the word of the Lord
[1:36:51] through Isaiah to the captive Daughter
[1:36:52] of Zion was you first got to get up out
[1:36:55] of your
[1:36:58] victimhood you got to come out of that
[1:37:00] wo it's me and I'm not loved like
[1:37:03] everybody else I'm not treasured like
[1:37:06] everybody
[1:37:08] else if you're waiting on someone to
[1:37:10] respect
[1:37:14] you there's two things you need to know
[1:37:18] number one you need to be
[1:37:22] respectable if if you want to be honored
[1:37:24] you need to be
[1:37:26] honorable and a double-minded
[1:37:29] man is unstable in all of his ways a man
[1:37:33] who's on fire one
[1:37:35] service and dead the next is not to be
[1:37:39] honored or respected he's to be
[1:37:42] challenged that's a double-minded
[1:37:46] man we've got to have the victory
[1:37:48] whether we feel it or
[1:37:51] not come on we've got to get get up out
[1:37:53] of
[1:37:55] victimhood it's a spirit I want you to
[1:37:58] know that not only is the spirit of Leo
[1:38:00] deia the age of people's rights it's
[1:38:03] also the age of the mentality of
[1:38:07] everybody is a
[1:38:10] victim let me tell you something you
[1:38:12] make up your mind I'm not going to be a
[1:38:13] victim anymore I'm a Victor I'm not a
[1:38:17] vict him I'm a
[1:38:20] Victor why because Jesus
[1:38:24] [Applause]
[1:38:25] Jesus Is the
[1:38:28] Victor come on now you look around at
[1:38:31] somebody else going through something
[1:38:32] you see how they praise you see how they
[1:38:35] don't let their problems affect their
[1:38:37] praise that's somebody to be honored
[1:38:40] somebody that comes in here with a
[1:38:41] praise when everything's going you know
[1:38:44] you can tell you can tell the look on
[1:38:46] people's face when they want
[1:38:50] attention and I got a little bit of a
[1:38:52] problem with that I've got a little
[1:38:54] problem when people feel sorry for theel
[1:38:56] and want to be
[1:38:57] noticed there's something in me that
[1:39:00] opposes that victimhood and I want to
[1:39:03] ignore that
[1:39:06] person you pray for me I'm I'm telling
[1:39:09] you the honest truth you pray for me
[1:39:11] because that may not be the right
[1:39:13] response but I know what else is not the
[1:39:16] right response petting somebody's feel
[1:39:18] sorry for me
[1:39:20] spirit that won't work either there
[1:39:22] comes a time that we've got to awake
[1:39:26] awake put on your strength oh Zion put
[1:39:32] on your beautiful garments Shake
[1:39:35] yourself from the dust
[1:39:39] arise and then sit
[1:39:44] down that sit down doesn't mean on your
[1:39:46] honey
[1:39:47] bone that means in your
[1:39:50] position do You Hear What brother
[1:39:52] brandom said when that bride realizes
[1:39:55] who she
[1:39:56] is do you understand that when you
[1:39:59] realize who you are who you belong to
[1:40:03] and what that makes you in the economy
[1:40:05] of God you won't want anybody to feel
[1:40:08] sorry for you
[1:40:11] anymore you'll want to point instead of
[1:40:13] pointing everybody to your problem
[1:40:15] you'll want to point everybody to your
[1:40:22] solution what if if I put an SOS out
[1:40:24] every time I had a
[1:40:26] problem what if I called on you to pray
[1:40:29] for me every time I face something in
[1:40:31] the course of seven
[1:40:32] days what if you did the same to me
[1:40:36] while we would be so encumbered with
[1:40:37] everybody's problems and burdens that we
[1:40:40] would never be able to hear anything
[1:40:41] from the Lord we'd come and not be

[1:46:51] Jesus
[1:46:54] here the captive Daughter of Zion I got
[1:46:56] to hurry she was only a a torn and
[1:47:01] tattered girl laying
[1:47:05] there revealed here in Isaiah sad and
[1:47:09] pitiful vision is what Israel had become
[1:47:13] keep in mind that Zion is more than
[1:47:15] ancient Israel it is also the redeemed
[1:47:18] of the Lord in this Midnight Hour Zion
[1:47:21] Is Us the captive Daughter of Zion could
[1:47:25] easily be us even under this message of
[1:47:28] Grace we are a Zion people I want you to
[1:47:33] listen again to this horrible
[1:47:34] description of the state of God's people
[1:47:37] in Isaiah's Vision the daughter of Zion
[1:47:40] a once pure and beautiful woman who gave
[1:47:43] birth to many sons of Israel now She
[1:47:46] lays like a slave in the dust she's been
[1:47:50] abused she's been molested she's been
[1:47:53] defiled by the
[1:47:55] uncircumcised by the unclean by the
[1:47:58] enemies of the god of Israel her
[1:48:01] garments are torn and filthy and she was
[1:48:04] [Applause]
[1:48:04] [Music]
[1:48:06] howling she wasn't
[1:48:09] whimpering she wasn't quietly
[1:48:12] weeping she was
[1:48:14] howling in her distress is anybody
[1:48:17] listening to me her
[1:48:20] despair had moved her to the point and
[1:48:24] she was howling like a sickened animal
[1:48:28] caught in a trap and Isaiah the prophet
[1:48:31] of God sees
[1:48:33] her he hears her
[1:48:38] hows he sees her
[1:48:42] Despair and oh how he longs to comfort
[1:48:47] her as a representative of God a prophet
[1:48:53] he wants to draw her up on to his
[1:48:57] arm he wants to lay her head on his
[1:49:01] shoulder and tell her I'm here stay with
[1:49:05] me tell her that everything is going to
[1:49:08] be all
[1:49:09] right he wants to brush off the
[1:49:12] dirt he wants to sooth their
[1:49:16] wounds that fatherly nature might even
[1:49:19] want to kiss her elbow I don't know
[1:49:21] you've got to remember there's no
[1:49:23] there's no lust here there's there's
[1:49:25] nothing unclean here this is a prophet
[1:49:28] God's God's representative on the earth
[1:49:31] and he sees the condition of God's
[1:49:34] people he might just have a
[1:49:36] gut-wrenching desire to kiss her wounds
[1:49:40] to anoint her to lift her up he's full
[1:49:45] of compassion for
[1:49:47] her he has pity on her condition it most
[1:49:53] is it would make one think that he would
[1:49:56] say oh precious
[1:49:59] daughter beautiful daughter of
[1:50:02] Zion don't worry anymore your answer is
[1:50:05] here I'm here to help you but he doesn't
[1:50:08] say any of that perhaps that's what his
[1:50:11] flesh would like to cry out on her
[1:50:13] behalf but instead he opens his mouth
[1:50:16] and the kna word of the Lord begins to
[1:50:18] flow out instead of saying I see you in
[1:50:23] your condition my heart is breaking for
[1:50:27] your pain my anger is stirred toward
[1:50:32] those who have left you here in this
[1:50:34] broken and bruised condition but as that
[1:50:37] word of the Lord begins to roll off of
[1:50:39] his lips none of that comes out it
[1:50:43] doesn't sound like pity it doesn't even
[1:50:45] sound like compassion the word of the
[1:50:48] Lord doesn't always soothe the emotion
[1:50:54] amen it doesn't always soothe oh God
[1:50:57] help me strengthen me it doesn't always
[1:51:00] soothe the emotion but the word of the
[1:51:02] Lord it may not sound like what we
[1:51:07] want it it may not sound like what we
[1:51:09] want but it's always what we
[1:51:12] need the word of the Lord the word of
[1:51:15] the Lord if I were you and I couldn't
[1:51:18] handle it I would find me a church with
[1:51:20] a
[1:51:21] pastor
[1:51:24] you understand what I'm saying I would
[1:51:26] find me a church with a Shepherd one who
[1:51:29] has no prophetic unction in his life and
[1:51:31] there are many like that if you need us
[1:51:34] to recommend a place we can even
[1:51:36] recommend places for you there are many
[1:51:39] pastors out there who have no prophetic
[1:51:41] unction and no prophetic call they don't
[1:51:43] need it they've been given a Shepherd's
[1:51:45] Heart they're pastoring out of a
[1:51:47] Shepherd's Heart of compassion and
[1:51:50] they're good to the sheep and they
[1:51:51] always know just the right words to say
[1:51:55] but if you choose if God should lead you
[1:51:58] and you make a choice to choose a pastor
[1:52:01] with a prophetic voice with some kind of
[1:52:03] little tiny little gifting or something
[1:52:05] like that in his life you must
[1:52:08] understand that the word of the Lord in
[1:52:10] his mouth will not always sound like
[1:52:13] what we need to hear but if it's truly
[1:52:16] God speaking if he's really been before
[1:52:19] the Lord if he's really heard the Lord's
[1:52:22] voice
[1:52:23] it may not sound like what she needs but
[1:52:25] it will always be exactly what God would
[1:52:30] have her to hear and this is what come
[1:52:33] out of Isaiah's mouth get
[1:52:37] [Applause]
[1:52:40] up he didn't mention the blood in her
[1:52:42] hair on
[1:52:44] now he didn't mention what looked like a
[1:52:47] broken
[1:52:48] arm he didn't mention the ruination of
[1:52:51] her beautiful dress yes he just said
[1:52:53] awake
[1:52:55] girl
[1:52:57] awake oh captive Daughter of Zion shake
[1:53:02] off the
[1:53:04] dust sir oh I'd like to speak to some of
[1:53:08] you here this morning who are drawing
[1:53:10] away from the Lord instead of drawing
[1:53:12] away toward the lord and you're
[1:53:14] wondering why things are going the way
[1:53:16] they're going in your
[1:53:18] life you think you can be good to
[1:53:21] somebody and kind to somebody and that's
[1:53:23] all it takes let me tell you something
[1:53:25] except a man be born
[1:53:28] again except a woman be born again she
[1:53:31] cannot inherit the kingdom of God it's
[1:53:34] not enough to be kind to the neighbor
[1:53:37] it's not
[1:53:39] enough to sit through long
[1:53:42] Services you've got to be born again
[1:53:46] you've got to have your own experience
[1:53:48] with the Lord come on now no
[1:53:50] grandchildren in this thing it's you in
[1:53:53] Jesus and instead of giving her these
[1:53:57] wonderful sweet precious kind
[1:54:01] compassionate
[1:54:02] words he looks to her and he says don't
[1:54:05] you
[1:54:05] realize that I'm about to do something
[1:54:08] in Jerusalem and I'm about to drive the
[1:54:11] unclean and the uncircumcised right out
[1:54:13] of her City you've got to shake yourself
[1:54:17] you've got to get yourself up you've got
[1:54:20] to get the dust off of you I can't clean
[1:54:23] you but you can clean yourself come on
[1:54:26] he said loose yourself from the bonds of
[1:54:29] your neck you don't wait on me to bring
[1:54:31] the
[1:54:34] key how could he say something so cruel
[1:54:37] and incompassion and because he knew
[1:54:40] that she wasn't really locked up at
[1:54:44] all she was still wearing a band on her
[1:54:47] neck that had been unlocked a long time
[1:54:50] ago she was being held To The Ground by
[1:54:54] an imaginary
[1:54:55] chain she was like the 12-ft shuffle she
[1:54:59] was like the bear that had marched that
[1:55:01] 12T forward and 12T backward and 12T
[1:55:04] forward and 12T backward that finally
[1:55:06] when he was even pushed out of the cage
[1:55:09] and there were no boundaries and there
[1:55:10] were no confinements he had he had so
[1:55:15] formed such a a habit and a comfort zone
[1:55:21] that even without out the cage he just
[1:55:23] continued 12T forward 12T backward I
[1:55:27] could lay my hands on people that have
[1:55:28] been in this church for years and you
[1:55:30] may have gotten excited a time or two
[1:55:32] and you may have run the aisle a time or
[1:55:34] two but the reality is you're still on a
[1:55:37] 12-ft shuffle we don't know from Sunday
[1:55:39] to Sunday whether you're going to be up
[1:55:41] or
[1:55:44] down we don't know from Sunday to Sunday
[1:55:47] whether you're going to have the victory
[1:55:48] or whether you're going to have already
[1:55:50] laid back down in the Meer in the mud in
[1:55:52] the cess
[1:55:54] poool that God had lifted you from come
[1:55:57] on now if you think I'm angry with you
[1:56:00] you're so wrong you you're so very very
[1:56:03] wrong but I'm hearing in my spirit that
[1:56:06] if you're going to climb a mountain
[1:56:08] you're going to have to make some
[1:56:10] decisions do you want to be pied or do
[1:56:13] you want to be
[1:56:15] prodded do you want to be pulled gently
[1:56:17] or do you want somebody who loves you to
[1:56:21] kick you in the the seed of the pants
[1:56:24] and tell you that you can have the
[1:56:26] victory if you want
[1:56:30] it you can't pray twice a
[1:56:34] week and have the
[1:56:36] victory you can't pray three times a
[1:56:39] week and have the victory you can hear
[1:56:42] the word twice a week and walk in the
[1:56:46] victory that's
[1:56:49] right this it is the truth this is an
[1:56:53] everyday

[2:01:55] lobby of the
[2:01:56] hotel I didn't know the water was going

[2:02:01] in my room because the wind was going to

[2:02:26] here with a flooded floor before I go in
[2:02:27] a room with no air
[2:02:32] conditioning I said I'm barefooted
[2:02:34] anyway won't hurt me I'll just Sosh
[2:02:36] around I'm not going nowhere she thought
[2:02:38] that was the funniest thing she'd ever

[2:02:41] do as soon as you get out here I'm going
[2:02:43] to pray the rain's going to stop and
[2:02:44] everything's going to be all right talk
[2:02:46] about looking at me
[2:02:50] she she took a double check well who
[2:02:52] that man think he is I said yeah soon as
[2:02:54] you get out we're going to pray God's
[2:02:56] going to shop the rain here she come in
[2:02:58] a few minutes I mean just a few minutes
[2:03:00] the rain
[2:03:01] stopped the the lobby started draining
[2:03:04] the floor I I said to the I said to the
[2:03:06] to to Benjamin Hulk I said the floor is
[2:03:10] dry not only did God stop the rain he
[2:03:13] dried up the
[2:03:14] floor we saw it with our own eyes she
[2:03:17] come down the hall she put her head in
[2:03:19] the room she said you meant it didn't
[2:03:21] you
[2:03:23] you me you were going to pray and God
[2:03:25] was going to do
[2:03:27] it she said thank you that's who we
[2:03:31] [Applause]
[2:03:34] are I think Benjamin sent a video to
[2:03:37] Jenna he wanted Jenna to feel sorry for
[2:03:40] him and I think he sent a video to her
[2:03:42] down in Louisiana Camp show to the floor
[2:03:44] flood it I didn't send out no
[2:03:48] video to tell somebody how roughly life
[2:03:52] was on the mission
[2:03:55] field I just said now Lord You've washed
[2:03:59] off the
[2:04:00] dust youve fed the
[2:04:03] crops now I need you to stop the
[2:04:07] rain and you know what it don't take a
[2:04:10] great big
[2:04:11] faith it just takes faith in a great big
[2:04:18] God that spoken word in your mouth mouth
[2:04:22] is more powerful than you
[2:04:25] realize your mouth is more powerful than
[2:04:28] you realize and do you know what's the
[2:04:30] problem with that there's a downside to
[2:04:33] having so much power in your tongue
[2:04:35] there's a
[2:04:36] downside because one way or the other
[2:04:38] you're creating the
[2:04:39] world that you're living
[2:04:43] in you're creating the atmosphere that
[2:04:46] you live in one way or the other with
[2:04:48] your words if you're the victim
[2:04:52] that's all that comes out of your mouth
[2:04:55] you're creating a bubble of
[2:05:03] pity I wish I was a
[2:05:06] preacher I'd
[2:05:10] preach thank you Mama
[2:05:17] Flo he didn't tell her how much he felt

[2:05:33] wear but you had it hadn't changed who
[2:05:35] you are you're still the daughter of
[2:05:39] Zion you may been taken advantage of the
[2:05:43] enemy may have taken advantage of you he
[2:05:45] may blooded you he may have Gob smacked
[2:05:47] you a time or two but you're who you
[2:05:49] always were from the moment you gave
[2:05:51] your heart to the Lord by the birth of
[2:05:54] his Spirit you became a Son of
[2:05:58] God remember brother bam tells us that
[2:06:01] Adam's Fellowship

[2:06:08] change he's now a sinner but he's still
[2:06:12] a
[2:06:16] son he is still a
[2:06:18] son that little bit of pride it's crept
[2:06:22] in on some of you this morning because
[2:06:23] you think you're being preached at you
[2:06:25] ought to get rid of that
[2:06:27] now you ought to get rid of that now cuz

[2:06:33] confusion you're going to shut that down

[2:13:47] not standing so very far from
[2:13:50] her
[2:13:52] mocking
[2:13:54] blaspheming taunting her that her God
[2:13:59] had lost his power to set her free from
[2:14:08] slavery it sounds like certain aspects
[2:14:12] certain
[2:14:13] clicks around this
[2:14:16] message where they tell you you've got
[2:14:19] to live with your with your weakness

[2:14:25] and hoping that one day it's going to
[2:14:27] get better I have no confidence in that
[2:14:29] kind of a message that's not the same
[2:14:31] one I heard in 1988 it's a different
[2:14:34] message the one the one I hear says this

[2:14:45] not a better anti-depressant anywhere in
[2:14:48] this world than feasting on that word
[2:14:51] there's not a chemotherapy that's better
[2:14:53] for what ailed you than that word right

[2:15:57] and your enemy is looking at you yeah
[2:16:00] God's lost his power hadn't he Your
[2:16:03] Enthusiasm is draining Now isn't it
[2:16:05] you've been here a couple years and it's
[2:16:07] not as precious to you as it was when
[2:16:09] you first came come on he's mocking he's
[2:16:13] mocking I thought you left everything
[2:16:15] you had behind to come and find a better
[2:16:17] mocking mocking mocking mocking that's
[2:16:21] what he
[2:16:23] does he
[2:16:25] mocks he
[2:16:28] taunts the Bible tells us that two
[2:16:31] terrible things had come upon her in in
[2:16:33] Isaiah
[2:16:34] 51:19 it said no one was sorry for
[2:16:40] her no one showed her any
[2:16:43] compassion no one showed her any
[2:16:46] sympathy are you with
[2:16:48] me and number two no one would comfort
[2:16:52] her and so guess what she did she just
[2:16:55] made up her mind I'll just stay where I
[2:16:58] am nobody has compassion for me nobody
[2:17:01] feels sorry for me and there's nobody to
[2:17:03] comfort me so I will bite off my
[2:17:07] nose and spite my
[2:17:10] face I'll show
[2:17:13] them I'll just show them I'll lay right
[2:17:16] here and
[2:17:19] moan I'll let let a fresh move of are
[2:17:22] you hearing me I'll let a fresh move of
[2:17:25] the spirit of God let me tell you
[2:17:27] something right now I can predict to you
[2:17:29] the ones that will shake my hand
[2:17:32] today and the ones that will say to me
[2:17:35] Pastor thank you for delivering an
[2:17:37] uncomfortable word and I can lay my
[2:17:40] hands on those of you that won't look at
[2:17:42] me the rest of the
[2:17:45] afternoon and neither reaction is going
[2:17:47] to change
[2:17:49] anything I have learned I need your
[2:17:52] amens to get through a sermon don't
[2:17:55] don't misunderstand me but I have
[2:17:57] learned to live without your
[2:18:01] validation and without your
[2:18:04] fellowship a pastor who can't learn to
[2:18:07] survive without validation and without
[2:18:11] Fellowship is going to be a
[2:18:14] failure the suicide rate among pastors
[2:18:17] is higher in 2023 than it has ever been
[2:18:21] in the history of the world of keeping
[2:18:23] records of suicidal pastors I want you
[2:18:26] to know just in case you're wondering
[2:18:28] I'm not one of those right now who's
[2:18:30] struggling with
[2:18:32] suicide but I'll tell you what I will do
[2:18:35] if I ever get to that place I'll do what
[2:18:39] I did as an 11year old boy I'll throw
[2:18:42] myself down at the foot of my bed and I
[2:18:45] will call on The God Who came to me as a
[2:18:49] child who delivered me from from a
[2:18:51] spirit of lust that would have taken me
[2:18:53] off
[2:18:56] track you would have read about my life
[2:18:58] you would have seen me on TV you would
[2:19:00] have known my my sin it would have
[2:19:03] surely been exposed had God not come and
[2:19:06] rescued
[2:19:09] me I didn't even know what to ask for I
[2:19:12] didn't even know what was wrong with me
[2:19:15] I just knew that something was trying to
[2:19:18] take a hold of my life and I saw saw my
[2:19:21] great-grandfather I saw my grandfather I
[2:19:24] saw my father and I knew that whatever
[2:19:27] had destroyed their lives and
[2:19:29] marriages was determined to destroy mine
[2:19:33] that's
[2:19:35] right so I threw myself and that's what
[2:19:37] I would do so you can rest
[2:19:40] assure that I will do that
[2:19:43] again I'll probably send a text on my
[2:19:47] way down to brother
[2:19:49] gy and say pray for
[2:19:52] me I'm tired and I'm I'm I'm I'm having
[2:19:56] a temptation to check out and I'd like
[2:19:58] for you to pray for me but I certainly
[2:20:01] will not sit there and wait on his
[2:20:02] prayers to get
[2:20:06] through how dare you ask me to pray for
[2:20:12] you when you won't pray for
[2:20:19] yourself true that's right how mad do
[2:20:22] you think I am not at
[2:20:24] all when you won't pray for
[2:20:28] yourself on when you won't Shake
[2:20:32] Yourself pray brother shell that God
[2:20:34] will shake me
[2:20:37] no no on if we loosed God to shake us he
[2:20:43] might not
[2:20:46] stop but if we learn to shake ourselves
[2:20:52] [Music]
[2:20:59] let's talk about it let's sit down for a
[2:21:02] few
[2:21:03] hours and see if you can solve the
[2:21:06] problems that I have created in 15 years
[2:21:09] of
[2:21:11] marriage I got the answer I
[2:21:16] can't I don't have any
[2:21:19] wisdom I I don't have any
[2:21:21] ability to
[2:21:23] untangle our
[2:21:25] mess I can't untangle my own
[2:21:28] messes all I can do is If he if he helps
[2:21:31] me I'll try to help you but if he

[2:21:41] own I know it's

[2:21:50] family family who can untangle
[2:21:54] them I'll tell you one more time don't
[2:21:56] quit having children that you're going
[2:21:59] to ship off to somebody else to
[2:22:02] raise boy that's tough ain't it if
[2:22:05] you're going to bring them here to this
[2:22:07] world you raise
[2:22:08] them and you raise them right in the
[2:22:11] fear of God and don't get your little
[2:22:13] feelings hurt when you can't find a
[2:22:15] babysitter every time you need
[2:22:19] one and let me just go ahead while I'm

[2:22:59] dreams I

[2:23:20] say her own Sons her sons you see the
[2:23:25] captive Daughter of Zion is a
[2:23:28] mother she gave birth to many
[2:23:31] sons the Bible tells us in 51:18 Isaiah

[2:23:40] own Sons had
[2:23:42] fainted and lay like a wild bull in a
[2:23:49] net she was absolutely
[2:23:53] alone there was no one to come to her
[2:23:59] rescue there is none to guide her among
[2:24:04] all the
[2:24:06] sons whom she had brought
[2:24:09] forth neither is there
[2:24:12] any that taketh her by the hand of all
[2:24:17] the

[2:27:17] the hour the revelation of Jesus
[2:27:24] Christ oh I wish I had a pastor who
[2:27:27] would tell me about current events I
[2:27:30] wish I had a pastor who would preach to
[2:27:33] me where I'm living come
[2:27:40] on get
[2:27:42] up get up out of the dirt there's no
[2:27:46] anger in me when I say that in fact my
[2:27:49] heart breaks
[2:27:51] when I think about the times I wasted
[2:27:53] laying in my
[2:27:55] victimhood when the word of the Lord was
[2:27:57] n me sir already in my
[2:28:01] mouth but I needed everybody worried
[2:28:03] about me I needed everybody moving
[2:28:06] around scurrying around you know there's
[2:28:08] certain members of the
[2:28:10] family that have a little problem and
[2:28:12] everybody just goes I mean absolutely
[2:28:15] crazy and the other son can have a
[2:28:17] problem and nobody even moves
[2:28:23] one daughter she she sends out a a call
[2:28:28] and everybody's cousin's husband's
[2:28:31] wife's cousins show up to
[2:28:35] help C people are still handling one
[2:28:38] another like
[2:28:42] children we parents are probably the
[2:28:45] most guilty still handling them like
[2:28:48] children when sometimes we need to bite
[2:28:51] our lip and turn our
[2:28:56] head I made up my mind that I wasn't
[2:29:00] going to run myself
[2:29:02] crazy for for for every little
[2:29:06] infraction that I saw in my
[2:29:08] children sometimes they wear things I
[2:29:11] wish they didn't wear sometime they put
[2:29:14] on something a little different than
[2:29:15] what I would what I wish but what I have
[2:29:18] learned is Daddy can do a whole lot more
[2:29:20] on his knees and I go there I go there I
[2:29:23] say when I know I'm supposed to say
[2:29:25] something I'm going to say something you
[2:29:27] don't have to
[2:29:28] worry but there are times I just have to
[2:29:31] get down and say holy
[2:29:35] ghost get them and don't let them go
[2:29:37] until they see that there is nothing in
[2:29:40] the Shimmer shammer and the glitter
[2:29:43] glamour of this old world that means
[2:29:46] anything when you're in a fight for
[2:29:49] survival
[2:29:56] it don't
[2:29:59] matter in her hands there had been a cup
[2:30:01] of
[2:30:02] trembling oh me I've got to stop I'm wor
[2:30:05] out she lay in her
[2:30:08] disgrace trampled in the Dust by the
[2:30:11] enemy I had 15 pages I was going to read
[2:30:13] I wouldn't going to preach I was just
[2:30:14] going to read laying in
[2:30:17] disgrace an enemy who walk walked over
[2:30:22] her the one who had borne the vessels of
[2:30:24] the
[2:30:25] Lord was now polluted and unclean and
[2:30:29] laying in her pitiful
[2:30:32] slavery her unsatisfied hunger her
[2:30:35] helpless condition she had fallen into a
[2:30:38] stuper her sensitivities and
[2:30:41] sensibilities were
[2:30:43] gone something had gripped her
[2:30:46] soul she was
[2:30:48] drunk
[2:30:50] but not with
[2:30:51] wine Isaiah
[2:30:54] 51:21 she was so mentally confused so
[2:30:57] emotionally wrecked that she could only
[2:31:00] lie in the
[2:31:01] dust stunned and defenseless
[2:31:05] useless unless something would happen
[2:31:08] soon she would surely fall into a coma
[2:31:11] and die there on the hill like an animal
[2:31:15] in Chains the tragedy are you with me
[2:31:19] the tragedy of of it all is that this
[2:31:21] poor enslaved Daughter of Zion had sold
[2:31:28] herself ain't that what the scripture
[2:31:30] said she had sold herself into
[2:31:35] slavery and got no joy in the
[2:31:40] ransom no one was holding her as a
[2:31:43] slave she sold herself at her own will
[2:31:47] she chose slavery instead of of Freedom
[2:31:51] did you know there are times that
[2:31:52] slavery is more comfortable than having
[2:31:54] to
[2:32:02] adult the tragedy no satanic slave
[2:32:05] traitor had captured her and carried her
[2:32:07] away against her will she had not been
[2:32:09] overcome by some ungrate unseen power
[2:32:12] she had sold herself into slavery guess
[2:32:15] what the price
[2:32:16] was
[2:32:18] nothing
[2:32:20] Isaiah 52:3 you have sold yourself for
[2:32:28] not the captive Daughter of Zion today
[2:32:31] is not just Israel not just the Jewish
[2:32:34] people it's any and
[2:32:36] all who number themselves among the
[2:32:39] redeemed yet choose to live in
[2:32:42] sin that's right those who remained in
[2:32:46] any form of unbelief could be likened to
[2:32:49] the captive Daughter of Zion this
[2:32:51] pitiful creature is the believer who is
[2:32:54] chained to a secret
[2:32:56] sin it's the one who brings reproach on
[2:32:59] God's house by living a double life or
[2:33:02] the one who refuses to deal with the
[2:33:05] Yoke that's upon his or her shoulder
[2:33:08] because they want someone to hand them
[2:33:10] their
[2:33:11] freedom hand them their Deliverance
[2:33:14] right I can tell when I go to pray for
[2:33:18] somebody whether they're going to what
[2:33:20] they need or not and it doesn't depend
[2:33:22] on my faith and it doesn't depend on my
[2:33:25] prayer it depends on whether they're
[2:33:27] ready to
[2:33:28] receive the reality sometimes is are
[2:33:31] they ready to
[2:33:34] adult are they ready to take
[2:33:43] responsibility are they going to let
[2:33:45] their condition keep them in the
[2:33:48] bed or are they going to crawl out on
[2:33:51] all
[2:33:53] fours and say I refuse to die like
[2:33:56] this I've got herbs to harvest
[2:34:02] josana I've got things I need to
[2:34:05] do I've got things that need to be done
[2:34:08] and nobody's going to do them but
[2:34:12] me hello hello hello hello hello hello
[2:34:16] hello it's anyone who takes a break from
[2:34:19] his sin to cover the altar with
[2:34:23] tears but has no intention of getting
[2:34:26] rid of the
[2:34:29] pet it's the man or woman who's won many
[2:34:32] souls to
[2:34:33] Christ whose spiritual life is being
[2:34:36] drained by
[2:34:39] lust it's all who are chained by an
[2:34:41] unforsaken sin or an unattended
[2:34:43] hindrance or distraction faed down in
[2:34:46] the dust of Despair ring with guilt and
[2:34:49] walked upon by the enemy who gets them
[2:34:50] to indulge at his will and whim there
[2:34:53] can be no True Deliverance from The
[2:34:56] Binding chain of sin until we see
[2:34:59] ourselves as a Daughter of Zion in the
[2:35:02] dust chained trampled on slowly sinking
[2:35:05] into a spiritual stuper while we argue
[2:35:08] between ourselves in our house who is
[2:35:10] more spiritual the husband or the
[2:35:17] wife well I'm more spiritual than you no
[2:35:20] I'm more spiritual than you well God
[2:35:22] gave me that well no well well God
[2:35:23] didn't give it to me
[2:35:30] well does it really
[2:35:33] matter you bloody
[2:35:37] husband oh now he's gone to cussing like
[2:35:39] an
[2:35:41] Australian I was only quoting what
[2:35:43] Zapora said you've been a bloody husband
[2:35:45] to me you're the one that got lazy and
[2:35:48] sorry and would no longer circumcise the
[2:35:51] sons you bear the responsibility of
[2:35:54] Israel and her disgrace because you quit
[2:35:56] taking the knife and cutting off the
[2:35:59] foreskin you alone Moses are responsible
[2:36:02] for the weakened condition of the people
[2:36:04] of God because you wouldn't tell them
[2:36:05] the
[2:36:06] truth I may be guilty of hurting your
[2:36:08] feelings but I will not be guilty of not
[2:36:11] telling you the
[2:36:13] truth brother we must look at this
[2:36:16] vision of Isaiah and cry out oh God
[2:36:21] I've laid here long
[2:36:24] enough brother sister isn't it time to
[2:36:27] take an honest look at that one ruling
[2:36:30] passion that one sin that still enslaves
[2:36:34] us that one sin we keep going back to
[2:36:37] time after
[2:36:38] [Music]
[2:36:43] time I want to ask some of you this
[2:36:46] question if you were to compare the
[2:36:49] pleasure of your sin to the pain that it
[2:36:54] causes would it be worth the
[2:36:57] effort most of us can
[2:37:00] testify that the pleasures of of
[2:37:02] unbelief the pleasures of sin and the
[2:37:04] attributes of unbelief are so
[2:37:07] fleeting and so
[2:37:11] temporary and sometime the pleasure
[2:37:13] hasn't ended when the guilt has already
[2:37:16] come pouring
[2:37:18] in
[2:37:21] and as an army of God we need to raise
[2:37:23] up and say it's not worth it it's just
[2:37:25] not worth it anymore it's just not worth
[2:37:26] it anymore to be tormented by my own
[2:37:29] self it's just not worth it anymore it's
[2:37:31] not worth it anymore to wait on someone
[2:37:34] to feel sorry for me it's just not worth
[2:37:36] it anymore to wait on somebody to come
[2:37:38] by and comfort me and then I'll try to
[2:37:40] get up it's just not worth it anymore to
[2:37:42] wait for a raise on my job and then I'll
[2:37:45] get everything straightened out on or if
[2:37:47] I can just own my own business or if I
[2:37:49] can just do this or I can just do it
[2:37:50] then I'll get where I need to be with
[2:37:52] God if I can get all the mold scrubbed I
[2:37:54] can't preach to them no more they're not
[2:37:57] here if I can just get all the mold
[2:37:59] scrubbed out it' be something
[2:38:02] else you get the the mold out in the
[2:38:05] mouse poop will be there come on I'm
[2:38:06] really getting raw
[2:38:09] now brother it's just
[2:38:12] life but you and I have got to find the
[2:38:15] victory we've got to learn to dance in
[2:38:17] the rain we've got to learn to give God
[2:38:20] praise in grief in
[2:38:24] loss we've got to learn like David the
[2:38:27] lord giveth and the lord taketh away

[2:40:11] elephant I didn't tell her she couldn't

[2:40:16] wondering why do you want to hold the

[2:40:47] soul I wanted
[2:40:50] to weep with her I wanted to be
[2:40:53] compassionate I wanted to feel sorry for
[2:40:56] her I knew it could be a
[2:41:00] help but I saw all those little children
[2:41:02] all they wanted to do was go see the
[2:41:05] elephants and I made a split-second
[2:41:08] decision that I don't
[2:41:12] regret I took her by the
[2:41:15] arm and we snatched her up so fast
[2:41:21] that she didn't even know she
[2:41:25] fell and on the way up I said get up
[2:41:28] from
[2:41:30] there there's no time for you to lay
[2:41:34] around we got elephants to say come
[2:41:41] on

[2:41:56] checked
[2:41:59] everything next thing you know she had
[2:42:01] her purse stuck and here she
[2:42:05] goes what if she'd have had a pastor
[2:42:08] instead of this
[2:42:12] impostor she'd have been in an
[2:42:16] ambulance she'd have been on her way to
[2:42:18] X
[2:42:21] she didn't need an x-ray she needed
[2:42:24] somebody to tell her it ain't as bad as
[2:42:26] it
[2:42:30] [Applause]
[2:42:31] looks she needed a mama like I had walk
[2:42:36] it
[2:42:40] off walk it
[2:42:42] off what's your
[2:42:45] problem sometimes what we think we need
[2:42:49] it's not really what we
[2:42:52] need but I know a God who knows what I
[2:42:56] need when I don't even know what it
[2:43:01] is here this poor woman I'm closing
[2:43:04] musicians are tiptoeing to the
[2:43:08] platform that means not drawing
[2:43:11] attention to themselves but just
[2:43:14] delicately making their way to the
[2:43:16] platform no selfies on the way
[2:43:25] no Benjamin with a camera
[2:43:29] going right in the middle of my mission
[2:43:34] report loose
[2:43:37] thyself show me the
[2:43:39] verse show me the
[2:43:45] verse shape thyself from the Dust
[2:43:56] I I know what I know what depression is
[2:44:01] like I thought if I got married I'd
[2:44:03] never be depressed again
[2:44:08] wrong there's nothing like a good wife
[2:44:11] to depress
[2:44:14] you I had panic
[2:44:16] attacks anxiety
[2:44:22] my doctor my medical doctor said' I
[2:44:24] don't think I'd marry right now you're
[2:44:27] you're really in a tether
[2:44:32] and I thought I thought in my mind
[2:44:35] perhaps and you probably thought the
[2:44:37] same a change of
[2:44:40] scenery change of responsibility willix
[2:44:43] no it just comes
[2:44:46] back I thought when Benjamin came I'd
[2:44:49] never deal with depression
[2:44:51] again I thought here come a second son
[2:44:56] and two beautiful
[2:44:59] daughters life is good and the bills are
[2:45:01] finally paid
[2:45:06] and but that's not how depression
[2:45:09] works sometimes it's
[2:45:12] chemical sometimes it's
[2:45:14] [Music]
[2:45:16] environmental sometimes it's demonic
[2:45:19] everything can be going good in your
[2:45:21] life and you just feel so
[2:45:25] heavy every bill paid and everything in
[2:45:27] order and you can become so anxious that
[2:45:30] you feel like your chest is squeezing
[2:45:32] and you need a
[2:45:36] doctor you can go from one house repair
[2:45:41] to the next and you can uh even put the
[2:45:46] pump truck on speed dial and
[2:45:51] there'll be something
[2:45:55] else you get rid of that nagging person
[2:45:58] on your
[2:45:59] job Lord if I can just get rid of that
[2:46:02] woman life will be so
[2:46:05] good and here comes you know one right
[2:46:09] out of
[2:46:11] hell makes it so much
[2:46:16] worse I I know people who thought uh
[2:46:19] wife number one nearly killed me so I'll
[2:46:21] I'll find me another one
[2:46:25] and and number two was
[2:46:32] worse you see the enemy is always going
[2:46:35] to find
[2:46:37] something and because it's little to me
[2:46:40] doesn't mean it's little to you or it's
[2:46:41] big to me doesn't mean it's going to be
[2:46:42] big to you we're all made differently
[2:46:45] all wondrously made in the image of God
[2:46:47] and we're all aect Ed different by the

[2:58:51] departure and we saw the place where the
[2:58:53] ships would would would
[2:58:56] part and the little dingy boats would
