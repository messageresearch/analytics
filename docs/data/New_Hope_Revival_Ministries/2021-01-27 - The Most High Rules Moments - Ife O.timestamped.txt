[0:00] i believe that the most high
[0:03] rules in the kingdom of men
[0:13] i cannot get my mind around a god and i
[0:17] certainly cannot give my life i cannot
[0:21] forgive me for being so bold
[0:23] i cannot give my life to a god that's
[0:26] powerless against his own enemy
[0:30] i cannot give my life to a god that a
[0:32] democrat can fool
[0:35] or or a voting machine can cheat
[0:38] or that a bunch of people can steal and
[0:41] god doesn't have any power to do
[0:43] anything about it i cannot
[0:45] because my scripture tells me the word
[0:47] tells me
[0:48] the most high not only rules in the
[0:51] kingdom of eternity the kingdom of light
[0:53] the kingdom of god
[0:54] but he also has rule in the kingdom of
[0:57] man
[0:57] and guess how he brings that up to pass
[1:00] he uses men
[1:02] he puts evil intent
[1:07] he puts evil intent in men's hearts and
[1:10] causes him to move against
[1:12] things that they don't even know what
[1:14] they're doing
[1:15] and god sits above and says
[1:19] one of the reasons why i'd get through
[1:22] it is because i want god to know
[1:24] that i have not changed my mind i
[1:27] believe that the most
[1:29] high rules in the kingdom of man
[1:34] i believe that the king's heart
[1:37] is not in his own hand as
[1:40] much as it is in the lord's hand
[1:44] i believe it is god who causes the
[1:47] waters to turn
[1:48] and the river to overflow its banks and
[1:51] even change its course
[1:54] he has a way of working his
[1:57] will in the kingdoms of men
[2:00] because he has one purpose and that is
[2:04] to build sons
[2:07] we are looking for souls god is looking
[2:10] for sons
[2:12] [Music]
[2:14] we want souls so that he can have more
[2:16] sons
[2:17] but god is after sons he doesn't want
[2:21] screaming babies we're talking about
[2:25] mature sons
[2:27] wheels we're talking about sons
[2:30] trained learned been through the fire
[2:35] have come to a measure of maturity and
[2:38] god
[2:38] is going to manifest himself through
[2:40] such people
[2:42] in the last days if you believe that
[2:43] same man
