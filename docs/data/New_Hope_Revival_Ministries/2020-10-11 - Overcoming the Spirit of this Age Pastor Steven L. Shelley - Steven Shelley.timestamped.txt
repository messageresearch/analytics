[30:19] [Applause]
[30:21] our god
[30:26] i just want to share this with you a
[30:27] moment and we're going to sing a little
[30:29] bit more of that before we move on this
[30:31] morning
[30:32] we don't have to be in a hurry if you
[30:34] are here and you need to slip out at any
[30:37] time
[30:38] you can but we sure hate to see you go
[30:41] i'm already feeling that this morning
[30:43] when i woke up from about four hours of
[30:45] sleep
[30:46] i was already thinking how sad it is to
[30:49] have to say goodbye
[30:51] but i'm so thankful that there is coming
[30:54] an hour
[30:55] oh much closer than a lot of people
[30:57] understand
[30:59] where we'll be so driven together so
[31:02] pressed together
[31:04] and then
[31:06] taken together
[31:08] we're looking for that hour
[31:10] brother branham talked about the
[31:12] manifestation of perfect love and
[31:15] we understand
[31:17] that's not something we can manufacture
[31:21] you can't just sit down and squeeze and
[31:24] say oh
[31:25] i'm gonna i'm gonna have perfect love
[31:27] it's a baptism
[31:29] it's a birth
[31:31] it's a completion it's something that
[31:33] god will do for us on the inside of the
[31:36] inside
[31:37] brother branham was talking about our
[31:39] latter rain brethren
[31:41] and he said when i was among them there
[31:43] were a lot of things he didn't care for
[31:45] and he thought they had missed it on a
[31:47] lot of things but he said that was the
[31:49] closest it was he said it was nigh to
[31:53] perfect love
[31:54] because they
[31:55] really stuck together
[31:58] and they really stood together
[32:01] and he talked about when that
[32:03] manifestation comes it being so real
[32:06] that we would just lay our head on one
[32:08] another's shoulder and weep
[32:10] because it would be a little while
[32:12] before we'd see one another again
[32:15] wouldn't you like to have that not as an
[32:17] emotion but as a manifestation
[32:21] wouldn't you like to know that god is
[32:22] birthing that kind of perfect love
[32:26] in you
[32:27] and we believe that it's on the horizon
[32:30] and uh
[32:32] he said something that a lot of people
[32:34] laugh at he said why that would make you
[32:37] feel like you could chew one another's
[32:38] chewing gum
[32:43] you think about the carnality of that
[32:45] and and the thought of that brother
[32:46] darren i know you that oh
[32:50] that don't sound very appealing does it
[32:53] but being so one but you know if it was
[32:55] your wives
[32:57] if it was somebody
[33:01] if it was my wives
[33:03] [Music]
[33:06] when is your young and you do a lot of
[33:08] things you pick the passy up off the
[33:11] ground and lick it off
[33:13] dirt and all so it's clean for them
[33:17] it's not the chewing of the gum
[33:19] but it's that brotherly kindness
[33:22] it's what god really wants to do in our
[33:24] life
[33:25] real quickly i haven't said a whole lot
[33:28] so i think i can take a moment just a
[33:29] quick another quick moment here
[33:31] but before this camp meeting started
[33:34] some maybe a couple months ago
[33:36] the lord was dealing with this we were
[33:37] praying for our nation and we've been
[33:40] praying we haven't said a lot about it
[33:41] in the service but we've been praying
[33:43] for our nation
[33:45] and believing that god's perfect will
[33:47] will be done
[33:49] i know what my will is for the next few
[33:52] years but we
[33:54] realize that god has an economy and he
[33:56] has a plan and he has a purpose
[33:58] and sometimes
[34:00] it is
[34:01] to raise up a king
[34:04] and sometimes it's to allow the people
[34:07] to raise up a king
[34:09] but all a part of god's plan
[34:12] and so we were just kind of experiencing
[34:15] in the spirit that there were things
[34:17] that had not yet been established
[34:20] that there were some things still
[34:22] hanging in the balance
[34:24] and when we mean that we mean between
[34:26] the perfect and the permissive will of
[34:29] god
[34:30] god will allow
[34:32] you know you can sometimes get what you
[34:34] want
[34:35] and then pay a price for it because it
[34:38] was permitted but it wasn't perfect how
[34:40] many of you want the perfect will of god
[34:42] i want that no matter what that looks
[34:45] like for our nation i want the perfect
[34:47] will of god and the lord dealt with us
[34:49] that there would be some things settled
[34:51] in the realm of the spirit at
[34:54] tabernacle's time
[34:57] and we are finished with tabernacles and
[35:00] now we are at simcat torah
[35:03] which is the celebration the joy of god
[35:07] establishing his instructions for us
[35:10] and if we were in in a jewish house of
[35:13] worship today we would be dancing with
[35:15] the scroll
[35:17] and we would be celebrating what god has
[35:20] done
[35:21] and last night there was such a moving
[35:23] of the spirit here
[35:25] deep moving
[35:26] i didn't know what all was god was doing
[35:29] but i made my way back over there and i
[35:31] heard that internal voice of the lord
[35:34] and he said do not fear for the lion of
[35:38] the tribe of judah has prevailed
[35:42] and i know that scripture
[35:45] but when inspiration comes and you hear
[35:47] it on the inside of the inside i was
[35:50] able to say lord i don't know exactly
[35:52] what that looks like but i know that
[35:55] over the united states of america and
[35:57] the nations of the world i can declare
[36:00] as a part of god's little bride that the
[36:03] lion of the tribe of judah the precious
[36:06] lamb of god
[36:08] has prevailed
[36:10] hallelujah and i'm also so thankful that
[36:13] he has taken the book
[36:15] and he has loosed the seals thereof and
[36:18] that there is a bright body that's
[36:21] feasting on the living
[36:23] word of jesus christ
[36:26] he's no longer behind the lattice but he
[36:29] is unveiled before our eyes in the
[36:33] fullness of his word
[36:35] and i wanted to share that as my little
[36:37] part and could we just sing of course a
[36:40] couple of times through again how great
[36:42] is our god or whatever you have and i
[36:44] want you to i know you're tired and

[1:10:10] but being a christian means
[1:10:12] that you have a real relationship with
[1:10:14] god
[1:10:15] an intimate relationship
[1:10:18] and i shall thank god for that because
[1:10:20] he's my friend he's my mother he's my
[1:10:22] brother
[1:10:23] he's my comforter he's my all in all
[1:10:28] at night i lay
[1:10:31] in bed
[1:10:33] and i
[1:10:35] began to
[1:10:38] cry
[1:10:42] [Music]
[1:10:43] and my mind is
[1:10:46] space to
[1:10:49] exactly why
[1:10:56] i can't explain
[1:10:59] with tongue or pin
[1:11:02] the spirit's
[1:11:04] growl is deep within
[1:11:09] it must be gone
[1:11:12] here in my soul
[1:11:16] cause i feel
[1:11:18] the poor

[1:11:41] to live

[1:11:53] called to the deep
[1:11:56] like a great magnet
[1:12:00] drawing me
[1:12:03] it must be god hallelujah here in my
[1:12:08] soul
[1:12:10] cause i feel the pull
[1:12:16] i feel
[1:12:19] [Music]

[1:18:07] we ask you turn
[1:18:10] to two passes of scripture
[1:18:14] i listened to
[1:18:16] brother shelley i appreciate him
[1:18:18] as a dear friend and
[1:18:20] brother in christ
[1:18:24] and i really just
[1:18:26] when i heard him say that
[1:18:31] about fearing not
[1:18:35] lying of the tribe of judah has
[1:18:37] prevailed
[1:18:39] i get i get excited
[1:18:42] just talk about the line of judah and
[1:18:45] his prevailing i get excited
[1:18:50] we're going to ask that you turn with us
[1:18:52] to revelations 1
[1:18:57] 17 and 18 verse
[1:19:00] then we'll ask if you turn with us to
[1:19:02] saint luke
[1:19:05] 12. praise
[1:19:09] revelations one
[1:19:13] i don't know about everybody else but i
[1:19:14] have thoroughly enjoyed myself
[1:19:18] not only that i know i'm walking away
[1:19:20] with the change
[1:19:23] god has touched me
[1:19:25] he's done something for me
[1:19:27] and i'm grateful to the lord
[1:19:30] because i am such an unworthy creature
[1:19:33] in myself
[1:19:35] my worthiness only comes by him
[1:19:39] revelations 1 17 and when i saw him i
[1:19:42] fell at his feet as dead
[1:19:44] and he laid
[1:19:46] his right hand upon me saying unto me
[1:19:49] fear not
[1:19:50] i am the first and the last
[1:19:54] i am he that liveth and was dead
[1:19:57] and behold i am alive forevermore amen
[1:20:00] and have the keys of hell and of death
[1:20:04] and i don't know whether you've noticed
[1:20:05] the songs or even the songs go right
[1:20:08] with what god
[1:20:09] wants to say
[1:20:11] luke 12 please
[1:20:16] we have something that the world
[1:20:18] do not have
[1:20:21] and i believe by god's grace
[1:20:24] this message has come
[1:20:26] to bring us of hire
[1:20:30] we have
[1:20:31] uh lived in in a time where
[1:20:34] we we thought we knew
[1:20:37] all that god wanted us to know
[1:20:40] and i think i heard uh brother shelley
[1:20:42] say this the other day when i said like
[1:20:44] this when i was in the apostolic church
[1:20:46] i didn't think you could go any higher
[1:20:49] that's the same as the pentecostals you
[1:20:50] just think you can't get go any higher
[1:20:52] you got to you got the holy ghost
[1:20:55] but then we found out amen there's
[1:20:57] another step
[1:21:00] and that god doesn't stand still he
[1:21:02] keeps moving
[1:21:05] and i want to move with the pillow fire
[1:21:06] as the pillar fire move i want to move
[1:21:09] with the pillow fire
[1:21:11] saint luke 12.
[1:21:12] [Music]
[1:21:13] 32.
[1:21:14] [Music]
[1:21:16] one thing i have come to know
[1:21:19] and learn
[1:21:20] i really don't care about what people
[1:21:22] think about me
[1:21:25] i strive to have a good name
[1:21:28] but if they want to give me a bad one
[1:21:31] it still doesn't change the good one
[1:21:34] because it's not about what people think
[1:21:36] about you
[1:21:37] it's about what he thinks about you
[1:21:41] saint luke 12
[1:21:43] 32 fear not
[1:21:46] little flock
[1:21:47] for it is your father's good pleasure to
[1:21:50] give you the kingdom
[1:21:52] sell that you have
[1:21:54] give arms provide yourself bags with
[1:21:57] whack which wax not old
[1:22:00] a treasure in heaven that faileth not
[1:22:03] when no thief approaches neither moth
[1:22:06] corrupted
[1:22:08] for where your treasure is
[1:22:10] there will your heart be also
[1:22:14] let us pray
[1:22:16] father god we come before you
[1:22:18] we thank you for your grace and your
[1:22:20] mercy we thank you for being so good to
[1:22:24] us
[1:22:25] there are no words that can express our
[1:22:27] gratitude
[1:22:28] but i thank god you know my heart
[1:22:35] and the joy and the love that's in my
[1:22:37] heart
[1:22:39] father you gave it to me
[1:22:43] and i want to surrender back to you
[1:22:47] what you have given me
[1:22:50] bless your in a special way
[1:22:53] and we'll be careful to give you the
[1:22:54] praise glory and honor
[1:22:58] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[1:23:02] you may be seated
[1:23:16] as i was saying
[1:23:19] i think the last service i'm not sure
[1:23:23] but i was kind of typing out
[1:23:25] and mentioning the holies of holies
[1:23:29] and in that message i talked about how
[1:23:31] that
[1:23:33] each segment of the
[1:23:36] or pattern of the the tabernacle had
[1:23:39] some kind of light yes
[1:23:42] the outer court
[1:23:44] which had the sunlight
[1:23:48] of course if the clouds came over
[1:23:53] or rain
[1:23:54] or cold or whatever it may be
[1:23:56] uh that typed out the the christian
[1:24:01] in that outer court and that's what we
[1:24:03] do go we go through our flesh
[1:24:06] changes
[1:24:07] things changes
[1:24:09] and if we're not careful the flesh will
[1:24:10] change
[1:24:12] with the atmosphere
[1:24:15] and then to go into the
[1:24:18] holy place
[1:24:20] we know in that area you have the seven
[1:24:24] golden candlesticks
[1:24:26] and these candlesticks
[1:24:29] must be maintained
[1:24:31] by man
[1:24:32] [Music]
[1:24:34] the first court is operated by man
[1:24:38] the second court is operated by man
[1:24:42] but in the third court which is called
[1:24:44] the holies of holies
[1:24:46] it is operated only by god
[1:24:51] and we know that by god's grace that if
[1:24:54] you're in that second coat where the
[1:24:56] seven church ages or the seven golden
[1:24:58] candlesticks are there which represents
[1:25:00] the seven church ages those lights
[1:25:04] those candle lights can be
[1:25:06] be uh put out yes sir
[1:25:09] and often time they go out because of
[1:25:12] not maintaining them
[1:25:15] keeping the build-up
[1:25:17] away off of them
[1:25:19] and so that's even how christians do
[1:25:23] we we come to a place where
[1:25:25] you know we let things hinder us in our
[1:25:28] prayer lives and our studying and things
[1:25:31] of that nature and therefore it affects
[1:25:33] us in our spirit
[1:25:36] and then you've got what we call the
[1:25:37] holies of holies
[1:25:40] and in that place there is
[1:25:42] no light
[1:25:45] until god comes
[1:25:48] but that place is the darkest of all
[1:25:51] places
[1:25:53] until
[1:25:55] god comes
[1:25:58] even in the darkness
[1:26:00] you have the
[1:26:02] cherubims
[1:26:05] you have the mercy seat
[1:26:10] you have that
[1:26:12] table or box that they stand or set on
[1:26:14] but nevertheless
[1:26:18] those things cannot help you
[1:26:20] until
[1:26:25] the light of glory comes down
[1:26:27] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:26:30] because even in the mercy seat which was
[1:26:32] a uh uh uh uh a lid covered with with uh
[1:26:36] gold
[1:26:37] that covered the little box
[1:26:39] or the box in which
[1:26:42] the
[1:26:42] the word of god was in
[1:26:47] even all of that
[1:26:51] life wasn't there
[1:26:53] until the glory of god
[1:26:57] would come down
[1:27:00] i said all of that because i want you to
[1:27:02] understand as christians
[1:27:05] we declare that the word of god is in
[1:27:07] our hearts
[1:27:09] but oftentimes we live as christians
[1:27:13] in the outer court
[1:27:18] sometimes we live as christians
[1:27:20] in the inner court
[1:27:22] but that's not where god
[1:27:24] wants us to be
[1:27:28] and understand that all of these things
[1:27:31] in the inner outer court in the inner
[1:27:33] court can be maintained or handled by
[1:27:36] man
[1:27:38] remember amen we talk about the statue
[1:27:41] of a perfect man
[1:27:43] but even that
[1:27:46] can fall under christian science
[1:27:49] it is a human thing that we can do we
[1:27:51] can act good we can look good
[1:27:54] we can dress good and it all looks good
[1:27:59] but life is not there
[1:28:03] until the glory of god comes down
[1:28:08] you and i must understand
[1:28:14] that we're living in the last days
[1:28:17] seven church ages have gone and come and
[1:28:20] gone and now we're living in an age
[1:28:22] that's what we call an eternal age
[1:28:26] but it represents more than just to say
[1:28:28] we're in the eighth day or the eighth
[1:28:30] age or however people wants to say it
[1:28:34] something
[1:28:36] fantastic happened
[1:28:39] and god alone did it
[1:28:43] and when god came in this last day he
[1:28:45] opened the word in a way that we had
[1:28:48] never seen it before
[1:28:51] hallelujah
[1:28:53] understand amen with those it's amazing
[1:28:57] because even the prophet of god did not
[1:28:58] understand what was happening
[1:29:00] in the message sir it's the time he was
[1:29:02] going around and he was looking at the
[1:29:04] visions and the dreams and and all of
[1:29:06] the things that had been said unto him
[1:29:08] and he did not know
[1:29:10] what god was getting ready to do
[1:29:14] hallelujah
[1:29:15] understand
[1:29:17] there was a time that god spoke to him
[1:29:21] and he had to interpret and do all of
[1:29:23] these things but there's a time
[1:29:26] when god stepped into that vessel
[1:29:31] hallelujah
[1:29:33] remember he said he was caught up into
[1:29:35] the consolation
[1:29:37] and you and i must understand what that
[1:29:39] really is because a lot of people say oh
[1:29:41] well it was the virtues amen that was
[1:29:43] the thunders but listen even the ephesus
[1:29:45] had those virtues as i said the other
[1:29:48] night they had those virtues and if they
[1:29:51] were so connected with god the prophet
[1:29:53] of god said all they had to do was get a
[1:29:55] nod
[1:29:56] and they would know what to do
[1:29:59] hallelujah
[1:30:00] so is something even beyond that
[1:30:05] sir hallelujah
[1:30:07] and nobody understood you know people in
[1:30:10] the message she said well brother said
[1:30:11] don't interpret it we'll interpret
[1:30:13] itself but you got to understand
[1:30:15] brother branham has been gone
[1:30:18] since 65
[1:30:19] and at what point in time is going to
[1:30:21] interpret itself see the world has been
[1:30:24] open
[1:30:25] y'all understand me and he said it went
[1:30:27] up like a rocket and five rockets came
[1:30:29] out of that rocket and it kept opening
[1:30:32] up and opening up and opening up and
[1:30:34] that's what god is doing now
[1:30:37] it never stops unfolding and it cannot
[1:30:41] stop unfolding until it meets its
[1:30:44] purpose
[1:30:46] [Music]
[1:30:49] hallelujah
[1:30:52] and so many of us we want to live back
[1:30:55] there
[1:30:56] you know that's why so many people are
[1:30:58] stuck
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:00] have you ever seen people amen who stuck
[1:31:02] in the 60s
[1:31:04] they got the 60s hell dude
[1:31:07] the 60s closed
[1:31:09] they stuck
[1:31:12] because they failed to move on with the
[1:31:14] trend
[1:31:15] that's how it is in this message
[1:31:18] people are still stuck
[1:31:20] they're stuck back there with the
[1:31:22] prophet
[1:31:23] now many people think i'm preaching
[1:31:25] against him but that's not true
[1:31:28] because even when joshua came on the
[1:31:30] scene which represents the holy ghost
[1:31:32] god said unto joshua say to the people
[1:31:35] moses is dead but remember everything
[1:31:38] moses has said
[1:31:40] so the message i'm preaching is the same
[1:31:43] message he preached but it's unfolding
[1:31:46] to us
[1:31:48] why because this message is to produce a
[1:31:51] rapture
[1:31:55] hallelujah
[1:31:57] and we can't go backwards
[1:32:01] god is there's a ministry going on
[1:32:03] remember now i said the other day that
[1:32:06] apostasy
[1:32:09] in if you you find yourself moving in
[1:32:12] apostasy is really the truth of what we
[1:32:15] call the mark of the beast
[1:32:18] it's when you
[1:32:19] outright reject truth
[1:32:23] ain't god don't you say well did it just
[1:32:26] start no the mark of the beast has been
[1:32:28] gone alone all along
[1:32:31] we didn't know what it was
[1:32:34] until god opened up the word
[1:32:38] we're not a system
[1:32:40] we are the life
[1:32:42] of christ
[1:32:46] and the life of christ cannot be
[1:32:48] systemized
[1:32:51] he whom the son is set free it's free
[1:32:54] indeed
[1:32:55] hallelujah
[1:32:57] now i want to bring something
[1:32:59] and i trust that i could bring this
[1:33:01] thing in a way that you can see
[1:33:04] when god
[1:33:05] uh showed moses the the the diagram of
[1:33:09] uh of the temple
[1:33:12] and and you know like i said many people
[1:33:15] think uh god is in heaven sitting on the
[1:33:17] throne but there was more to that than
[1:33:19] you know god
[1:33:20] listen revelation is a book of symbols
[1:33:24] and god has to relate to us in simple
[1:33:27] form
[1:33:28] in order for us to understand what he's
[1:33:30] doing
[1:33:32] let me ask you a question
[1:33:34] jesus said if you overcome
[1:33:37] you're set with me on my father's throne
[1:33:40] as i have sat on his throne
[1:33:43] do you think jesus is sitting up on a
[1:33:44] chair
[1:33:48] it is a position
[1:33:50] it is a an authoritative position
[1:33:55] that god is giving us
[1:33:58] can you imagine how big that chair would
[1:34:01] be if if the number that could not be
[1:34:04] counted
[1:34:11] but what i'm trying to say is because
[1:34:13] this diagram was all about salvation
[1:34:18] it was about god saving mankind
[1:34:25] and he showed us amen by god's grace
[1:34:27] amen through a prophet what he's
[1:34:29] expecting of us see israel did the
[1:34:33] rituals
[1:34:34] and never came to understand
[1:34:38] what those rituals was about
[1:34:42] hallelujah
[1:34:43] and if you're not careful
[1:34:45] you'll come to the same place
[1:34:48] where you won't understand even why god
[1:34:51] had to sin a prophet
[1:34:55] he had to come
[1:34:57] because that's the only way god could
[1:34:59] relate to us
[1:35:01] he said i will do nothing except i
[1:35:03] reveal my secrets to the prophets
[1:35:07] but remember when a prophet comes it's
[1:35:10] at the end of the age
[1:35:12] there's a time when you got to turn
[1:35:15] because he's going to turn
[1:35:17] and if you don't turn you will miss the
[1:35:20] visitation of god
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:23] and that's what has happened to a lot of
[1:35:24] people in the message they did not turn
[1:35:28] they stayed
[1:35:30] thinking that they would be secure
[1:35:32] is that right
[1:35:34] remember i'm just going to give you an
[1:35:35] illustration when jesus preached and he
[1:35:38] told his disciples when you see
[1:35:41] the enemies incompetent about jerusalem
[1:35:44] [Music]
[1:35:45] don't go back to your house
[1:35:47] if you're on the mountain don't come
[1:35:48] down wherever you are you feel don't
[1:35:51] come back don't come back and get your
[1:35:53] stuff
[1:35:55] y'all understand me
[1:35:56] and those who believed his word
[1:35:59] when titus came in 70 a.d
[1:36:02] they escaped the slaughter
[1:36:05] but those who had made jerusalem
[1:36:09] and idol are worshipped
[1:36:12] huh
[1:36:13] they made jerusalem holy
[1:36:17] hallelujah but let me say it this way
[1:36:19] jerusalem is not holy if the holy god is
[1:36:22] not there
[1:36:24] what makes us holy is when the holy god
[1:36:27] is there
[1:36:28] there's no such thing as holy water
[1:36:30] unless the water
[1:36:32] holy god is in the water there's no such
[1:36:34] thing as a holy man unless the holy god
[1:36:37] is in the man
[1:36:38] nothing is holy except god
[1:36:43] this is what i try to tell people i said
[1:36:46] here it was god can make dirk holy
[1:36:51] is that right
[1:36:52] that's what he did amen in moses day he
[1:36:54] said moses take off your shoes for the
[1:36:58] ground you stand on his holy ground
[1:37:01] and if god can make that dirt holy he
[1:37:04] can make this dirt holy he can make your
[1:37:07] dirt holy
[1:37:11] hallelujah
[1:37:16] we must understand
[1:37:17] he's god
[1:37:21] oh i just love that song he's been so
[1:37:24] good to me
[1:37:26] [Music]
[1:37:27] and here we go
[1:37:29] we see those
[1:37:30] seven angels coming and some people say
[1:37:32] well the seven messages of each age but
[1:37:34] no they were not
[1:37:36] i hate to disagree with you but anyway
[1:37:38] we come to a place
[1:37:40] and you know brother bam said he first
[1:37:41] saw those little angels and they looked
[1:37:43] like little birds
[1:37:45] he said then they came looking like
[1:37:46] doves
[1:37:48] he said but then the the next uh out of
[1:37:50] those three the last to come was angels
[1:37:54] hallelujah y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:37:57] and those angels when they came he said
[1:37:59] have you noticed that seventh one the
[1:38:02] noticeable one
[1:38:03] why because that notice
[1:38:06] one was the one that came to open up the
[1:38:09] seven seals
[1:38:12] brother branham didn't open the seals
[1:38:15] god did it
[1:38:17] hallelujah in the form of the lamb
[1:38:20] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:38:22] and then when those seven angels
[1:38:25] struck him and took him up into the
[1:38:27] constellation
[1:38:28] what did they do they formed
[1:38:32] the head of christ
[1:38:34] and these devils around here said it
[1:38:36] wasn't right
[1:38:37] these devils saying it wasn't of god
[1:38:40] let me tell you something when you
[1:38:41] attacked that you attacked my lord
[1:38:46] whoa
[1:38:47] i don't care
[1:38:51] how you can prove it
[1:38:55] i tried to tell people i said were you
[1:38:56] there when moses was there
[1:38:59] everything we believe must come by faith
[1:39:03] is that right
[1:39:04] moses was not there in the creation
[1:39:08] but god took him there
[1:39:11] somebody help me here see if you know a
[1:39:13] prophet when there's a real prophet he
[1:39:16] he's a time traveler
[1:39:21] huh he's a time traveler
[1:39:25] moses amen was able to see creation
[1:39:29] if you can't believe create moses you
[1:39:31] can't believe creation
[1:39:33] hallelujah i'm coming in just a minute
[1:39:35] people say well you know
[1:39:37] brother man i'm headed wrong
[1:39:39] you know uh uh
[1:39:41] uh uh enoch could uh noah could not have
[1:39:44] seen enoch because this that and the
[1:39:46] other and i said lord tell me how does
[1:39:48] that work you know what he said
[1:39:51] he said noah was a prophet
[1:39:54] noah time traveled
[1:39:57] he saw him
[1:40:00] he saw he not when he was translated he
[1:40:02] saw that
[1:40:04] now you don't have to believe it but the
[1:40:05] brother branham said he saw adam and eve
[1:40:10] he just did nothing to see adam and eve
[1:40:12] he saw a lot of people in their past
[1:40:15] oh come on somebody
[1:40:17] see it ain't the man it's god in the man
[1:40:22] you can't tie god up
[1:40:24] the church of the living god is not
[1:40:26] built upon the letter of the word the
[1:40:28] church of god is built upon revelations
[1:40:31] hallelujah and god revealed to us things
[1:40:34] amen that other people cannot even see
[1:40:38] oh but the bride of christ is ordained
[1:40:40] to see it
[1:40:42] you don't have to fear
[1:40:44] fear
[1:40:47] fear shouldn't even be in your
[1:40:48] vocabulary
[1:40:50] fear what
[1:40:52] if you got the true god and you
[1:40:54] understand what you possess
[1:40:58] hallelujah not the third person of the
[1:41:00] trinity
[1:41:02] not the second person of the trinity
[1:41:04] you've got god himself in you the very
[1:41:07] elohim
[1:41:09] call him what you want to
[1:41:12] because whatever you call him to bless
[1:41:13] his name he still is
[1:41:15] is that right
[1:41:17] he's so he saw he's got so many names
[1:41:21] he told moses when his moses said who
[1:41:24] shall i say send me
[1:41:26] he has so many names
[1:41:28] he said just tell them i am that i
[1:41:30] am hallelujah y'all understand me
[1:41:34] because every time god do something you
[1:41:37] got another name
[1:41:39] you got something you can call him to
[1:41:41] bless him
[1:41:43] hallelujah
[1:41:45] and when he changed dispensation again
[1:41:48] he'll have a new name
[1:41:53] yes sir hallelujah
[1:41:56] the lord is good to us
[1:41:58] and i'm coming to a place i'm going to
[1:42:00] say it like this you say well you said
[1:42:01] what what are you saying brother
[1:42:02] remember brother branham did not even
[1:42:04] know what the cloud was he saw the
[1:42:06] angels
[1:42:08] he saw all the figures and things in
[1:42:10] there
[1:42:11] two years later god told him to turn it
[1:42:13] right and when he turned it right he saw
[1:42:16] what
[1:42:17] he saw jesus he saw the the face
[1:42:22] of jesus christ
[1:42:24] is that right according to hoffman
[1:42:27] and that was that was the third time
[1:42:29] he'd seen him
[1:42:31] he'd seen him himself
[1:42:33] and then he saw a painting
[1:42:36] and then he saw him in the midst
[1:42:39] in a place no no no no no airplane or
[1:42:42] anything could go and do that
[1:42:45] y'all understand me we're talking about
[1:42:47] the 60s but i'm coming with that you see
[1:42:50] because in that
[1:42:52] he said we'll see him face to face
[1:42:57] and if i could say it like this
[1:42:59] if you can see his face
[1:43:01] you can see his body
[1:43:05] right
[1:43:06] because the earthly pyramid
[1:43:09] that pyramid that peter talked about he
[1:43:11] said that was an entrance
[1:43:14] i entered into what
[1:43:16] the holies of holies
[1:43:19] that was an entrance
[1:43:21] into the virtue and the divine nature of
[1:43:23] god
[1:43:24] god follow me
[1:43:26] and we climb up that machine that's the
[1:43:28] body
[1:43:30] but when the head came in 1963
[1:43:33] people still put the pyramid up there
[1:43:35] like there's no face to it but there's a
[1:43:37] face to it
[1:43:41] somebody help me here
[1:43:42] there's a face to it and that face
[1:43:45] unites with the body
[1:43:47] that's the day we're living in
[1:43:55] and then show you who you are
[1:43:58] can i about to go crazy up here
[1:44:01] i see something that i don't think
[1:44:03] you're getting it
[1:44:04] some of us are not getting it
[1:44:06] that's why it's it's a must
[1:44:10] you've got to go into the holies of
[1:44:11] holies
[1:44:13] you can't stay out there under the
[1:44:14] church ages you can't stay there and
[1:44:16] live
[1:44:18] [Music]
[1:44:20] is that right
[1:44:21] the word of god said except you kiss the
[1:44:24] son
[1:44:25] he's going to be angry with you
[1:44:27] that means you've got to have an
[1:44:29] intimate relationship
[1:44:33] god don't kiss everybody
[1:44:36] somebody help me here you if he kisses
[1:44:38] you that means it's intimate
[1:44:41] not only that that means you have become
[1:44:43] his bride his wife hallelujah
[1:44:47] oh god help me jesus
[1:44:49] i'm trying to bring something here
[1:44:51] let me tell you something
[1:44:53] oftentimes we don't see the power of
[1:44:55] prayer
[1:44:56] hallelujah remember even jesus had to
[1:44:59] pray
[1:45:00] did he not when he was in the garden of
[1:45:02] gethsemane he saw the battle that he was
[1:45:05] getting ready to face and he went there
[1:45:07] and he prayed
[1:45:10] he wasn't afraid
[1:45:12] no shah
[1:45:13] but he went in there to surrender his
[1:45:16] will
[1:45:18] see that's what prayer does for you it
[1:45:21] makes you surrender your will
[1:45:23] hallelujah not my will lord but dying be
[1:45:26] done
[1:45:27] so what
[1:45:28] happens god dispatches an angel
[1:45:34] and the bible said an angel strengthened
[1:45:36] him
[1:45:37] now i don't know how many times y'all
[1:45:38] seen angels around him but i've seen
[1:45:39] angels
[1:45:41] and i don't say that to boast or brag
[1:45:42] but i just say they come when they want
[1:45:44] to come and they go when they want to
[1:45:46] come you can't say oh lord send me an
[1:45:48] angel no he send them you know you know
[1:45:50] i mean whenever he wants to it's a
[1:45:52] sovereign thing that god does
[1:45:56] right but one of the things i want to
[1:45:59] say before i get to really where i'm
[1:46:00] going
[1:46:01] i said all of that to say this
[1:46:04] in this message
[1:46:06] if you don't come into the holies of
[1:46:08] holies your life will always be dark
[1:46:14] you'll never understand who you are
[1:46:17] or even what you are
[1:46:20] understand me
[1:46:21] we did not come by here and come in this
[1:46:24] this place by chance
[1:46:27] you and i we have been directly elected
[1:46:31] and chosen for this age
[1:46:34] that means every one of us that have
[1:46:36] been chosen for this age to make a
[1:46:39] rapture god is dealing with you right
[1:46:42] now
[1:46:45] and you can feel the urgency
[1:46:48] something in you
[1:46:50] you can feel it that's why the message
[1:46:51] was so powerful yesterday because all of
[1:46:55] us want more
[1:46:58] he struck that word he struck that
[1:47:00] channel give me more
[1:47:03] and that's what he just surprised and
[1:47:04] saying lord i want more of you
[1:47:09] hallelujah i've heard all that eliza has
[1:47:12] said but now i want what what elijah has
[1:47:15] told me
[1:47:16] hallelujah i'm not on my way amen to
[1:47:20] some fictitious promise i'm on my way to
[1:47:24] see the manifestation of that promise
[1:47:27] and everything elijah said he was he is
[1:47:31] and a whole lot more
[1:47:36] fear
[1:47:38] you see the political realm and
[1:47:39] everything is messing up
[1:47:41] i don't know how people sit in their st
[1:47:43] in their seats
[1:47:44] amen is burning amen on the west coast
[1:47:48] over there in louisiana is water's
[1:47:50] flooding everywhere
[1:47:52] over there in africa the locals are
[1:47:53] eating up everything
[1:47:55] there's drought everywhere
[1:47:57] don't y'all understand it
[1:48:01] the earth has been
[1:48:02] cursed there's judgment striking the
[1:48:06] earth
[1:48:08] we're in the midst of judgment
[1:48:12] but the only thing that keeps us from
[1:48:14] the judgment is the blood of jesus
[1:48:17] is that right
[1:48:19] it's like when rahab when they were
[1:48:21] shocking amen um
[1:48:24] jericho
[1:48:26] because of the scarlet robe
[1:48:28] the judgment that was pronounced on on
[1:48:32] jericho could not fall on rahab
[1:48:35] you think rahab was ringing her hands
[1:48:38] when the battle was going on
[1:48:40] no sir
[1:48:41] she had confidence
[1:48:43] hallelujah she had a promise
[1:48:46] that when the walls come down you and
[1:48:49] your house will be saved the bride of
[1:48:52] jesus christ has a promise
[1:48:55] that will all come down
[1:48:57] we will be saved
[1:49:00] is that right
[1:49:02] the prophet god said before one bomb
[1:49:04] drop
[1:49:05] we're going to be gone
[1:49:07] and i believe that
[1:49:09] hallelujah because the blood covers me
[1:49:13] [Music]
[1:49:14] not only does it cover
[1:49:17] it lives
[1:49:21] psalms 18.
[1:49:24] you know a lot of times we don't
[1:49:26] understand this word is perfect
[1:49:29] and i'm saying all of these things and i
[1:49:31] i know what i'm saying
[1:49:33] i believe this is with the will of god
[1:49:35] because this is fresh message i haven't
[1:49:36] even preached this at my own church
[1:49:39] god gave me this last night
[1:49:43] to put this message together for this
[1:49:45] service he vindicated it uh
[1:49:48] the pastor got up and talked about
[1:49:50] uh rest
[1:49:52] you know fear
[1:49:53] then almost every son will talk about no
[1:49:55] fear and the glory of god and who he is
[1:49:58] god and i don't know i just say it like
[1:50:00] this i'ma preach what he told me to
[1:50:01] preach
[1:50:02] i know it's here for somebody and we
[1:50:04] need to know amen god is talking
[1:50:06] directly to us
[1:50:10] because a lot of us don't have the
[1:50:12] confidence that we ought to have in
[1:50:14] prayer
[1:50:17] but you don't understand like i said the
[1:50:19] other day the angels of the lord is
[1:50:20] encamped about you
[1:50:22] you have an entourage
[1:50:25] you understand me not only does the
[1:50:27] angel of the lord but you have angels
[1:50:30] that have been dispatched
[1:50:32] on your behalf
[1:50:34] to protect you through this journey
[1:50:38] hallelujah it is the truth you can't see
[1:50:41] them but they're there
[1:50:43] and every now and again they will show
[1:50:45] themselves yes
[1:50:48] but even around this message they thank
[1:50:49] you crazy because you say you see an
[1:50:51] angel
[1:50:52] hallelujah
[1:50:55] well do they think i'm crazy because i
[1:50:57] say i got the holy ghost
[1:50:59] some of them thank you
[1:51:01] amen but i don't have a counterfeit
[1:51:04] i've got the real deal
[1:51:06] hallelujah how do you know brother
[1:51:08] brooks because he's changed me
[1:51:12] hallelujah he changed my walk he changed
[1:51:15] my talk he changed my friends he changed
[1:51:17] everything about me
[1:51:20] places i couldn't i couldn't change
[1:51:22] myself he changed me
[1:51:25] hallelujah
[1:51:26] [Music]
[1:51:27] you know i'ma say this because a lot of
[1:51:29] people they feel the holy ghost on the
[1:51:30] outside and they think praise god i'm on
[1:51:33] my way to heaven no you're not
[1:51:35] that may have been good for the age
[1:51:37] before but it doesn't work for this one
[1:51:41] hallelujah
[1:51:42] you know you know oh i'm gifted i'm
[1:51:44] getting
[1:51:45] you know that's good but the gifts of
[1:51:48] god
[1:51:49] and calling is without repentance
[1:51:52] god gave that to you when you was a
[1:51:54] ranked sinner
[1:51:56] hallelujah
[1:51:58] i'm not saying those things are not good
[1:52:00] but you cannot rest upon that
[1:52:04] whether you know it or not there's a lot
[1:52:06] of preachers in hell right now
[1:52:09] brother better call it a foot race
[1:52:11] hallelujah
[1:52:13] they're running
[1:52:14] because they've told people lies
[1:52:18] hallelujah
[1:52:20] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:52:23] now
[1:52:23] and i'm not i don't you know i'm
[1:52:25] including myself in this
[1:52:28] because i told the lord i said now lord
[1:52:29] i i've seen what happened to israel
[1:52:32] they seen all those miracles in egypt
[1:52:34] [Music]

[1:52:38] red sea back up
[1:52:40] they saw manna come down they saw the
[1:52:42] pillar of fire they saw all of that and
[1:52:44] said they still was lost
[1:52:46] i said please god
[1:52:48] don't let me be that kind
[1:52:51] in the midst of
[1:52:52] all of that let me keep my eyes on you
[1:52:57] see that was the difference between
[1:52:58] joshua and caleb they knew where it was
[1:53:00] coming from they made a connection
[1:53:03] and let me tell you something people of
[1:53:05] god you've got to make a connection
[1:53:10] hallelujah and what people don't
[1:53:13] understand the pyramid is not in two
[1:53:15] parts anymore
[1:53:17] it is one whole
[1:53:19] because there are those who are making
[1:53:21] the connection
[1:53:22] oh god
[1:53:25] you say because i don't see it i don't
[1:53:27] see it but that don't mean a thing
[1:53:29] it's raining somewhere and i don't see
[1:53:32] it
[1:53:34] but because i don't believe it well it's
[1:53:36] raining somewhere down there in georgia
[1:53:38] somewhere you know what i'm saying i
[1:53:40] don't see it
[1:53:41] but it's raining
[1:53:47] god ain't no man that he's gonna show
[1:53:49] off in front of you
[1:53:52] he's humble
[1:53:54] and he's take those little people that
[1:53:56] don't mean nothing to the world
[1:53:59] take the scum of the earth
[1:54:01] hallelujah and then he began to use them
[1:54:04] is that right
[1:54:06] take the woman at the well amen she was
[1:54:08] a woman of prosecution but god used her
[1:54:12] she had better eyesight than the
[1:54:14] religious people
[1:54:18] hallelujah
[1:54:20] thank god i don't want to change nothing
[1:54:23] about my life
[1:54:25] everything i went through
[1:54:26] and i've gone through some hard times
[1:54:30] but i don't want to change nothing
[1:54:32] because had not been for all those bad
[1:54:35] things i couldn't love him the way i
[1:54:37] love him now
[1:54:41] like that song say can't nobody do me
[1:54:43] like jesus
[1:54:45] huh
[1:54:47] oh
[1:54:48] my hey you have no idea
[1:54:52] how i've been persecuted in this message
[1:54:55] all my life
[1:54:57] when i was in the baptist church i was i
[1:54:59] was too much then
[1:55:06] then i went from the baptist to the
[1:55:07] catholic from the catholic to the
[1:55:09] methodist
[1:55:10] you know i went to the catholic church
[1:55:11] and well it's a long story but anyhow
[1:55:14] but nevertheless
[1:55:20] i tell people nowadays i say the
[1:55:22] catholic got more movement in their
[1:55:23] church than most people
[1:55:26] it might be systematic but they sit down
[1:55:28] and get up they sit down and get up
[1:55:31] they kneel they get down they kneel you
[1:55:34] know what i'm saying
[1:55:36] they're moving
[1:55:39] but nevertheless amen i went to the uh
[1:55:42] methodist and i thought oh i was the
[1:55:43] only one looking like a jumping bean up
[1:55:45] there
[1:55:48] then i got to the pentecostal and you
[1:55:50] know what they told me brother shelly
[1:55:51] they say you shout too much
[1:56:00] you know that's what you know it was all
[1:56:02] right for the women to do it but when a
[1:56:04] man shouted too much
[1:56:08] don't ever tell me what i can't do
[1:56:11] you are in trouble right
[1:56:16] i try to tell some of these dead
[1:56:18] churches i say y'all provoke me to
[1:56:20] worship him
[1:56:23] yeah
[1:56:25] he
[1:56:25] went to a concert and everybody still
[1:56:27] but me and my wife we were both moving
[1:56:29] and everything else we look like we were
[1:56:31] out of order
[1:56:33] hallelujah
[1:56:35] see the rod the lord is my rock and my
[1:56:38] fortress starting from the second
[1:56:40] verse psalms 18.
[1:56:44] one of the brothers at my church a young
[1:56:45] preacher troy he he ministered this this
[1:56:48] scripture and i'm like oh my god that's
[1:56:50] mine that's mine
[1:56:53] and whenever he strikes something i
[1:56:55] always tell him i said his mind now
[1:57:00] the lord is my rock and my fortress
[1:57:04] my deliverer now let me tell you what
[1:57:07] the outer court will do the outer court
[1:57:09] will make this same scripture
[1:57:12] become an intellectual concept
[1:57:15] [Music]
[1:57:16] in other words you'll be able to quote
[1:57:18] it
[1:57:18] but there is nothing in here
[1:57:22] that's what's wrong with a lot of people
[1:57:25] they know the scripture
[1:57:26] but they don't have the power
[1:57:29] that only belongs in the heart
[1:57:32] y'all hear what i'm saying you can shout
[1:57:34] you let me tell you something the devil
[1:57:36] don't care
[1:57:39] if faith is not in the heart he don't
[1:57:41] care how much emotions you show
[1:57:44] i got a scripture for that
[1:57:46] and i'm gonna come to that quickly you
[1:57:48] know because because what we fail to see
[1:57:50] is that the word of god is not meant for
[1:57:53] your head
[1:57:56] the word of god is meant for your heart
[1:58:02] i'm not going to be real alone tonight
[1:58:03] this morning but i want you to
[1:58:04] understand we must allow the word of god
[1:58:08] to saturate the heart
[1:58:11] and when it saturates the heart it
[1:58:13] becomes you
[1:58:15] as long as the word and you are separate
[1:58:18] something is wrong
[1:58:20] because the word must become you and you
[1:58:23] must become the word
[1:58:26] did you know that yes
[1:58:28] this whole ark thing the ark of the
[1:58:30] covenant and i've got to preach it i got
[1:58:32] a lot of notes but i got to preach it
[1:58:34] you know the thing is the ark of the
[1:58:36] covenant you know what the ark of the
[1:58:37] covenant was
[1:58:38] it was god
[1:58:40] really in simple form
[1:58:43] and israel was was so happy about that
[1:58:46] they had the ark of the covenant and
[1:58:48] every time god would come down something
[1:58:50] would happen
[1:58:53] but what happened is
[1:58:55] the word became
[1:58:57] an idol
[1:58:59] [Music]
[1:59:02] it became an idol
[1:59:05] and when it became an idol
[1:59:08] it lost its power
[1:59:13] remember
[1:59:14] there was a time that israel had the ark
[1:59:17] and they were losing the battle
[1:59:21] because their mental attitude toward it
[1:59:24] was in the wrong place
[1:59:27] god never intended israel to worship it
[1:59:32] just like when the brass serpent was was
[1:59:34] made
[1:59:35] when they needed healing
[1:59:38] just gave it a little time
[1:59:40] and it became an idol
[1:59:44] and we've done the same thing
[1:59:49] even the books and the tapes not
[1:59:51] supposed to become an idol
[1:59:56] i've seen people have heard of people
[1:59:58] trying to cast out devils and then lay a
[2:00:00] book up on somebody's head
[2:00:02] the power in the book
[2:00:08] the power is in you
[2:00:12] supposed to be anyway
[2:00:14] hallelujah that's where that's the
[2:00:16] caudal man thinking like that
[2:00:19] let me say it like this i got to go head
[2:00:20] on with it but you see
[2:00:22] when jesus christ he was born the word
[2:00:26] the written word was now him
[2:00:29] word made flesh
[2:00:31] but there was more to him than that
[2:00:35] he needed the anointing
[2:00:38] you see what i'm saying because the word
[2:00:40] of god was in that little box we call
[2:00:43] the mercy seat there in the box
[2:00:46] but that word was dead letter until the
[2:00:49] shekinah came down
[2:00:51] that's why jesus when he was there
[2:00:53] hallelujah
[2:00:56] the spirit of god said to john
[2:00:58] the one you see
[2:01:00] the light of god come down like a dove
[2:01:03] that's the one
[2:01:05] hallelujah and when the holy ghost came
[2:01:07] on the word guess what he was
[2:01:10] led into the wilderness to be tested
[2:01:18] having the message in your mind is good
[2:01:20] but that's not where it's supposed to
[2:01:22] stay
[2:01:23] it's supposed to be in your heart
[2:01:26] that's what david said
[2:01:28] hide thy word in my heart lord
[2:01:32] that i might not sin against thee he did
[2:01:34] not say he hide it in my head the devil
[2:01:37] got it in his head
[2:01:41] hallelujah the ark was not in the outer
[2:01:44] court
[2:01:45] the ark was not in the inner court the
[2:01:47] ark was in the holies of holies
[2:01:50] that's where god came down
[2:01:53] am i making sense
[2:01:55] this message opened up the way
[2:01:58] that we could come into
[2:02:02] the holies of holies
[2:02:04] and then when we come into the holies of
[2:02:06] holies we come in like priests and kings
[2:02:09] hallelujah you understand me you can't
[2:02:12] be a king if you don't have the power
[2:02:14] and the authority to rule
[2:02:16] you came to rule
[2:02:19] why
[2:02:21] because this thing that was done in
[2:02:22] shadow and type has now moved into the
[2:02:25] human body
[2:02:26] this is why the bible said you and i we
[2:02:28] are the temple of
[2:02:30] god ah we're the tabernacle of god
[2:02:34] see you can't comprehend this by your
[2:02:36] head
[2:02:38] faith come by hearing
[2:02:40] and hearing by the word of god
[2:02:43] in your heart
[2:02:45] is where you receive the word of god
[2:02:47] anyway let me hurry up with the
[2:02:48] scripture the lord is my rock in my
[2:02:50] fortress my deliverer my god my strength
[2:02:53] and whom i will trust my buckler and the
[2:02:55] horn of my salvation and my tower i will
[2:02:58] call upon the lord who is worthy to be
[2:03:00] praised so shall i be saved from my
[2:03:03] enemies
[2:03:05] right the sorrows of death compass me
[2:03:08] and the floods of ungodly men made me
[2:03:10] afraid
[2:03:11] huh
[2:03:12] the sorrows of hell
[2:03:14] compassed me about the snares of death
[2:03:17] prevented me
[2:03:19] and in my distress
[2:03:22] this is what i love about it see when
[2:03:24] you call on the name of the lord
[2:03:26] something's got to happen
[2:03:31] oh
[2:03:32] in my distress
[2:03:34] i called upon him
[2:03:36] hallelujah and cried unto my god he
[2:03:39] heard my voice out of his temple and my
[2:03:41] crowd came before him even unto his ears
[2:03:46] hallelujah when god hears your cry it
[2:03:49] shakes heaven
[2:03:52] wait a minute y'all y'all looking at me
[2:03:54] like i don't know what i'm talking about
[2:03:56] look at god's response
[2:03:58] then the earth shook and trembled the
[2:04:01] foundation also of the hills moved and
[2:04:04] was shaken because he was wroth
[2:04:10] was he upset
[2:04:11] because of how you were being treated
[2:04:14] hallelujah touch not my anointing
[2:04:18] and do my prophet no harm
[2:04:21] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[2:04:24] spirit of the lord will lift up a
[2:04:25] standard what is it those angels all of
[2:04:29] heaven comes to your rescue
[2:04:32] [Applause]
[2:04:34] [Music]
[2:04:36] hallelujah but you got a call from god
[2:04:38] call on god from your heart not your
[2:04:40] head
[2:04:43] hallelujah
[2:04:44] there went up a smoke out of his
[2:04:46] nostrils and fire out of the mouth
[2:04:48] devoured coals were killed by it
[2:04:51] he bowed the heavens also and came down
[2:04:53] and darkness was under his feet and he
[2:04:56] rolled upon the cherub and he did fly
[2:04:59] yeah he did fly upon the wings of his
[2:05:01] wings he made darkness his secret place
[2:05:04] his pavilion around about him were dark
[2:05:06] waters and thick clouds up the skies now
[2:05:09] when you see dark that don't mean he's
[2:05:10] evil
[2:05:11] that means he's mystical
[2:05:14] you can't understand him
[2:05:16] he's doing something that your brain
[2:05:17] can't comprehend
[2:05:19] hallelujah but he comes and when he
[2:05:22] comes hallelujah those of us we know
[2:05:24] when he comes
[2:05:26] hallelujah i can see shadrach meshach
[2:05:29] and abednego hey man getting ready to be
[2:05:31] thrown into the fiery furnace but they
[2:05:33] began to cry out to their god he didn't
[2:05:36] even answer them
[2:05:38] hallelujah they cried out let me tell
[2:05:40] you something when the pressure comes
[2:05:41] when the squeeze comes it does oh i
[2:05:43] gotta have a few goosebumps i don't know
[2:05:46] no sir why i know he always heareth my
[2:05:49] prayer

[2:05:52] prayer if you covered by the blood

[2:05:56] blood he always hear your prayer
[2:05:59] and when you pray you shake heaven
[2:06:03] is that right that's what brother
[2:06:04] branham said he says a son
[2:06:06] a son or daughter of god amen they're
[2:06:10] above the angels
[2:06:13] the angels are your servants
[2:06:15] you're above the angels
[2:06:17] and he said if an angel has a request
[2:06:20] and you've got a request your request is

[2:06:29] waiting list like that glory first come

[2:13:32] chapter you don't have to turn there
[2:13:34] but but i want you to want to say that
[2:13:36] here it was israel and you know they let
[2:13:39] me read it and the word of lord came to
[2:13:40] samuel to all israel now israel went out
[2:13:43] against the philistines to battle and
[2:13:44] pitch beside ebenezer and the philistine
[2:13:47] pitched at in apac in fact and the
[2:13:50] philistines put themselves in a ray
[2:13:52] against israel and when they joined
[2:13:54] battle israel was smitten before the
[2:13:56] philistines and they slew of the army in
[2:13:58] the field about about four thousand my
[2:14:01] question is
[2:14:03] see one thing about david he understood
[2:14:06] that god wasn't just in a box
[2:14:12] he didn't have to go and run to
[2:14:14] jerusalem or wherever the ark of the
[2:14:15] covenant was to and pray as god
[2:14:18] you know goliath is out there come help
[2:14:20] me
[2:14:22] he carried his god with him
[2:14:27] hallelujah
[2:14:28] and that's what we need to learn how to
[2:14:30] do is carry our god with us
[2:14:33] and the problem is we forget he's there
[2:14:37] we get in trouble like oh god have mercy
[2:14:40] and he's like
[2:14:42] i'm here what's wrong with you
[2:14:46] it's the truth
[2:14:48] and he's right there and we're looking
[2:14:50] everywhere and the bible said he ain't
[2:14:52] in heaven
[2:14:53] the bible said he's naive even in your
[2:14:55] mouth
[2:14:59] hallelujah and until we get into that
[2:15:01] place we ought to be which is that's
[2:15:03] your kind of glory not someday all day
[2:15:06] every day
[2:15:09] god in you the hope of glory
[2:15:12] that's where god is calling this little
[2:15:14] bride
[2:15:15] not to a religion not to a system
[2:15:19] but he's calling us so that we can
[2:15:21] become him
[2:15:22] a love affair
[2:15:24] doing the same things he's always done
[2:15:27] hallelujah there was never any fear
[2:15:31] in christ jesus
[2:15:34] help us jesus
[2:15:39] they were losing the battle
[2:15:41] why because they forgot god was with
[2:15:43] them
[2:15:43] they they thought god was just only in
[2:15:46] the box
[2:15:47] and remember when they say okay let's go
[2:15:50] get let's go get the ark of the covenant
[2:15:52] they went and got the ark of the
[2:15:54] covenant
[2:15:55] and they went up in a real warship a
[2:15:58] real praise but let me tell you
[2:16:00] something god don't care about that
[2:16:03] he wants you to recognize where he is
[2:16:07] hallelujah oh we feel the anointing
[2:16:10] people of god that's all good
[2:16:12] but god ain't just coming down god's
[2:16:15] supposed to be in you
[2:16:19] you understand me he's supposed to be in
[2:16:21] you and those two spirits are supposed
[2:16:23] to connect
[2:16:27] you should never have to say to an
[2:16:28] audience y'all come on now come on
[2:16:31] that's nonsense
[2:16:36] that's almost like my wife begging me to
[2:16:38] kiss her
[2:16:45] if your wife got to beg you to kiss her
[2:16:47] you need you trouble you got troubles
[2:16:51] you got you serious troubles
[2:16:55] normally you know what she said
[2:16:57] ah every time i look around you
[2:17:03] y'all know what i'm talking about but
[2:17:04] anyhow
[2:17:06] you and i must recognize
[2:17:09] what god is doing he likes he god is a
[2:17:11] lover you know
[2:17:14] god is a lover
[2:17:16] you don't believe it read songs of
[2:17:18] solomon
[2:17:19] god is a lover
[2:17:21] and he wants somebody to love on him
[2:17:25] just like he loves on you
[2:17:28] you don't want no forced issue
[2:17:34] yes sir you love the lord
[2:17:36] let me hurry up romans 7 you can come
[2:17:38] there with me i'm just going to jump a
[2:17:39] little bit you can read those scriptures
[2:17:40] for yourself you can see that what
[2:17:42] happened is they they forgot that god
[2:17:45] was with them all along but they put god
[2:17:47] in that box and that's where he stayed
[2:17:49] for
[2:17:50] perhaps
[2:17:51] he didn't fight for them
[2:17:54] god wants you to know that he's in your
[2:17:55] heart
[2:17:57] that's where he fights for you
[2:17:59] when he knows you're in the tabernacle
[2:18:01] or he's in the tabernacle you understand
[2:18:03] me
[2:18:04] hallelujah
[2:18:06] those hebrew boys think about it just a
[2:18:07] shadow and type over there but then you
[2:18:10] look at eli eli represented the
[2:18:12] backslidden pentecostals
[2:18:14] right
[2:18:15] let his sons and everybody do whatever
[2:18:17] they wanted to do
[2:18:19] eli wasn't right hallelujah
[2:18:22] you all hear me oh
[2:18:25] sometimes you got to stand against
[2:18:30] my children think i'm crazy anyway and i
[2:18:32] tell them y'all right i'm crazy in love
[2:18:34] with jesus
[2:18:38] don't take sides
[2:18:39] only side i take is jesus
[2:18:42] for that which i do i allow not for what
[2:18:45] i would that i do not but what i hate
[2:18:48] and that i do right if then i do that
[2:18:51] which i would not that's the 25th verse
[2:18:54] i consent unto the law that it is good
[2:18:56] that's all i'm trying to say whenever
[2:18:58] you allow the word of god just to be
[2:19:01] here
[2:19:03] in your mind
[2:19:06] you know what it's going to do
[2:19:07] it's going to cause sin
[2:19:10] to be more exceedingly great
[2:19:14] because you can't stop sin in your mind
[2:19:21] only the heart
[2:19:24] only the heart that's what paul was
[2:19:26] trying to say
[2:19:27] paul said listen i know evil is always
[2:19:29] present and there are times i i'm not
[2:19:31] working from the in the core i'm not
[2:19:33] working from the holy holies and then i
[2:19:35] find out when i'm not working with the
[2:19:37] holies of holies i find myself coming
[2:19:39] short
[2:19:42] is that right
[2:19:43] but if i work from here all the time i
[2:19:45] get victory all the time
[2:19:47] because jesus christ is there
[2:19:52] pastor i hope i'm saying something
[2:19:53] that'll bless you
[2:19:55] because i'm at a place right now all i
[2:19:57] could think about is getting closer to
[2:19:58] jesus
[2:20:00] you know my thing is this we're at a
[2:20:02] late date we're at a time that we have
[2:20:04] played message for a long time and it's
[2:20:06] time out for that
[2:20:08] it really is
[2:20:09] you know so oh well i you know people
[2:20:11] say well god give us grace oh grace but
[2:20:14] you know god said oh paul said shall i
[2:20:16] continue in sin that grace may abound he
[2:20:19] said god forbid
[2:20:21] hallelujah god expect for us to overcome
[2:20:24] these things
[2:20:25] you cannot get in the holies of holies
[2:20:27] being unclean that's automatic death
[2:20:33] even the high priest couldn't do it
[2:20:35] right if they had something going on in
[2:20:36] their life and they and they would walk
[2:20:38] into that place it was instant death and
[2:20:39] they had to pull them out of the stream
[2:20:42] but you know how a lot of times people
[2:20:43] don't understand their damn way because
[2:20:45] a lot of time when you see people come
[2:20:46] to church and they can't even make no
[2:20:47] noise
[2:20:51] huh
[2:20:52] ain't making no noise
[2:20:55] i ain't that kind no you you're dead
[2:21:00] you you need a resurrection
[2:21:01] [Music]
[2:21:03] you ain't got a jumping shot like me but
[2:21:05] you need to make some noise
[2:21:14] don't even get excited about the word
[2:21:16] something wrong
[2:21:21] you know what it is i sometimes when i
[2:21:23] say you know because if the word was in
[2:21:25] your spirit at least you're jerk a
[2:21:26] little bit
[2:21:28] you know what i'm saying
[2:21:30] you do something
[2:21:33] i said well where is this word where is
[2:21:35] this word you know it's because
[2:21:36] everybody you know people and i'm not
[2:21:38] trying to make it funny but the truth of
[2:21:39] the matter is something ain't right
[2:21:46] you know how we danced here the other
[2:21:48] night
[2:21:49] i guarantee you a lot of people have
[2:21:51] criticism about it
[2:21:52] but who cares
[2:21:56] who cares
[2:21:58] you know we're not here to gain
[2:21:59] popularity
[2:22:01] of no man
[2:22:03] we're here for jesus christ and him
[2:22:05] alone
[2:22:06] hallelujah that's why we do what we do
[2:22:10] we want to please him we could care less
[2:22:16] about saul's daughter don't trouble me
[2:22:19] she can look through her window and call
[2:22:21] me what she want to call me
[2:22:23] but it ain't going to stop my dancing
[2:22:25] hallelujah
[2:22:27] yes sir
[2:22:28] right
[2:22:30] that's one thing i know i can do
[2:22:34] hallelujah
[2:22:35] yes sir
[2:22:37] he ain't taking mine
[2:22:38] [Music]
[2:22:40] it's the truth when i was in the world i
[2:22:42] was a dancer
[2:22:44] oh i used to get it
[2:22:45] [Laughter]
[2:22:48] i'm just telling you the truth
[2:22:50] when i used to have parties almost every
[2:22:52] week so i could dance
[2:22:55] everybody knew everything was free
[2:22:58] right and i didn't wait nobody start
[2:22:59] y'all come in i'm already on the floor
[2:23:01] you know that's the kind of person i was
[2:23:03] you know i didn't go to a club amen to
[2:23:06] to wait every time everybody else could
[2:23:07] come on the floor
[2:23:10] i was on the floor
[2:23:15] and you mean to tell me i come to find
[2:23:17] out that this gift that i have came from
[2:23:18] god
[2:23:20] and the devil exploited it
[2:23:22] hallelujah and you want me to come into
[2:23:24] the house of the god and then sit still
[2:23:27] oh no no no that ain't gonna happen
[2:23:30] hallelujah these legs and these feet
[2:23:34] that's what i've got hallelujah was
[2:23:36] given to me to dance and to praise god
[2:23:38] with and i'm going to always do it
[2:23:43] [Applause]
[2:23:44] i'll do it when people ain't around
[2:23:48] hallelujah
[2:23:51] listen no matter how much anointing it
[2:23:53] is
[2:23:54] you've got to get in god's provided
[2:23:56] position
[2:23:58] see david anointing was all right but in
[2:24:01] doing it he got enthused and stepped
[2:24:04] over the boundary lines
[2:24:06] hallelujah it you can't carry it on a
[2:24:08] cart it's got to be over your heart
[2:24:12] that's where the word and the anointing
[2:24:14] must be in your heart
[2:24:16] [Music]
[2:24:18] otherwise you're bringing death to
[2:24:20] yourself
[2:24:22] help me jesus
[2:24:24] oh lord god is good to us
[2:24:27] you must understand amen every all of
[2:24:29] these supernatural things that we have
[2:24:30] seen
[2:24:31] all of those things were good
[2:24:34] but you got to make a connection
[2:24:38] you can't go by what brother branham
[2:24:40] said
[2:24:42] huh
[2:24:43] what he said was right
[2:24:45] but you got to commit connect to that
[2:24:47] the god he's talking about the god he's
[2:24:49] preaching about you got to make your own
[2:24:52] connection
[2:24:53] y'all
[2:24:54] am i wrong or right it's all right to
[2:24:56] say what brother branham did but daddy
[2:24:58] don't stop there
[2:25:02] how did they overcome they overcame by
[2:25:04] the blood of the lamb and the word of
[2:25:06] god testimony not somebody else's
[2:25:09] testimony he has had his testimony you
[2:25:12] must have yours
[2:25:17] you got to have your own
[2:25:21] hallelujah
[2:25:28] that's all i'm saying and then when you
[2:25:29] start talking like that people say well
[2:25:31] he don't believe the message you got it
[2:25:32] wrong i believe the message more than
[2:25:34] you do
[2:25:38] because i know the message didn't stop
[2:25:40] with the prophet
[2:25:44] the the same living god that used him
[2:25:48] has come to use me
[2:25:50] he may not use me the way he used him
[2:25:52] but he came to use me
[2:25:54] [Applause]
[2:25:55] hallelujah and i want the lord to use me
[2:25:59] can you imagine
[2:26:01] you going up there where they got all
[2:26:03] kinds of testimonies going on and you
[2:26:05] ain't got nothing
[2:26:10] think about it
[2:26:11] you don't have one thing to say
[2:26:18] i don't want to be there
[2:26:21] when i get over there i want to show my
[2:26:23] battle scars
[2:26:26] yeah that's the time you show them off
[2:26:28] right
[2:26:29] i want to show my testimonies i want to
[2:26:31] have something i can say lord this is
[2:26:33] what i used to be but look what you made
[2:26:35] me
[2:26:37] hallelujah
[2:26:38] these are kind of friends i used to hang
[2:26:41] with but lord look what you gave me
[2:26:44] see what people don't understand i don't
[2:26:46] have a family this family of god is all
[2:26:48] i got
[2:26:50] hallelujah you okay
[2:26:53] by god's grace you understand
[2:26:55] i showed you that prayer scripture to
[2:26:57] make you see that when you pray
[2:27:01] it puts heaven into motion
[2:27:09] prayer is just not just saying words
[2:27:12] prayer is that right well what about the
[2:27:14] little story brother we haven't talked
[2:27:15] about when the the
[2:27:17] the hebrew boys was in trouble
[2:27:19] and it's just the illustration but he
[2:27:21] says hey uh uh uh wormwood went over up
[2:27:23] to christ and said lord can i go he says
[2:27:25] no he said just give me a minute and
[2:27:27] i'll turn the world upside down
[2:27:30] and he could do it
[2:27:32] he did it in the days of the antelopian
[2:27:34] day he could have done it
[2:27:36] different angels came lord let me let me
[2:27:38] go let me go jesus said no
[2:27:41] no no no i've been watching this thing
[2:27:45] i'm going down myself
[2:27:47] see that's what other what people don't
[2:27:48] understand sometimes angels come into
[2:27:51] the audience and you feel the presence
[2:27:52] but when he comes
[2:27:55] when he comes hallelujah it changes the
[2:28:00] whole situation
[2:28:02] somebody help me here
[2:28:04] it changes the whole situation
[2:28:13] even our prophet was here when he was
[2:28:15] here he had jesus on the inside didn't
[2:28:17] he
[2:28:17] he said but i'm waiting on him
[2:28:20] somehow that you should understand
[2:28:22] there was a greater something coming
[2:28:28] whoo
[2:28:29] the captain of the lord rose i ain't got
[2:28:31] to worry about no demon

[2:28:36] ain't got to worry about anybody
[2:28:38] a blind or lame or maim why because he's
[2:28:41] coming

[3:17:26] down or make a note of it i'm a little
[3:17:28] bit sorry to tell you that
[3:17:30] that the sukkot tabernacles is early
[3:17:34] next year and that could mean a little
[3:17:37] bit warmer weather
[3:17:38] even than what we've had this week we
[3:17:41] were all anticipating sweater weather
[3:17:44] because it looked like that's where we
[3:17:45] were headed and then it turned warm
[3:17:47] again but
[3:17:49] we know that we don't control the
[3:17:50] calendar
[3:17:51] or the weather it's in god's hands
[3:17:54] so a camp meeting next year will begin
[3:17:57] on tuesday night september the 21st
[3:18:00] and we'll go all the way through sunday
[3:18:04] september the 26th because
[3:18:07] all of the feasts are early next year it
[3:18:10] happens to be the restarting of that
[3:18:12] cycle that will bring it early but we
[3:18:14] will be here in the name of the lord
[3:18:17] and uh i don't have any confirmation
[3:18:20] from these speakers but would you like
[3:18:23] to have them invited back in case they
[3:18:25] might be available for next year
[3:18:30] [Applause]
[3:18:36] somebody said you're putting them on the
[3:18:37] spot well they're not looking they're
[3:18:38] not looking how many of you'd like to
[3:18:40] have brother darren back if he's
[3:18:42] available
[3:18:43] all right how many of you'd like to have
[3:18:45] brother isaiah back all right we'll do
[3:18:48] it like the ten commandments uh so so
[3:18:51] let it be written so let it be done
[3:18:57] hallelujah
[3:18:58] come covet or high water
[3:19:02] we're to believe and of course you all
[3:19:05] hear from the lord but we'll be here and

[3:19:20] running and it's going to take a few
[3:19:23] days to catch our breath
[3:19:25] and then i think it will even hit us

[3:19:30] of what we've heard and what we've seen
[3:19:32] you do
[3:19:33] but lord we've done our best to praise
