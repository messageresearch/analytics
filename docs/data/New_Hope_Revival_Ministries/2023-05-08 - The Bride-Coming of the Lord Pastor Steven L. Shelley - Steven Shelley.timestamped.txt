[1:05:09] wonderful presence
[1:05:12] I mean he's here
[1:05:15] let's see what he will do
[1:05:20] I want got several things on my heart
[1:05:22] before we
[1:05:24] look to the word I'm going to need the
[1:05:26] words to he'll do it again I don't see
[1:05:28] it here in the book I'm not going to
[1:05:30] sing it just now but I will in a minute
[1:05:33] um
[1:05:35] several things we want to mention
[1:05:43] today is May the 7th
[1:05:45] and brother Branham tells us in the
[1:05:48] message that he was commissioned by an
[1:05:50] Angel of the Lord
[1:05:51] on May the 7th
[1:05:53] the year is a little uncertain
[1:05:56] he mentioned several different years and
[1:05:58] he says I think
[1:06:00] but uh it was somewhere around 1946
[1:06:05] May the fourth of May the 7th of 1946
[1:06:09] you can find that in the prayer line in
[1:06:12] 1953
[1:06:14] and you can find that in Gabriel's
[1:06:17] instructions to Daniel
[1:06:19] in 61.
[1:06:21] and in 60 he says I think it was around
[1:06:24] 14 15 years ago in 1937 now
[1:06:30] that was in 1960 when he said it how
[1:06:33] many of you know that uh
[1:06:35] 15 years from 1960 was not 37 so you
[1:06:40] know it's just good for me to know that
[1:06:42] God uses humans
[1:06:46] I get told all the time that I say it
[1:06:49] wrong or that I that I forget or I call
[1:06:52] somebody by the wrong name just be glad
[1:06:55] I'm calling you
[1:06:57] if you love me you better answer to
[1:06:59] anything I call you
[1:07:01] because I may come there's no telling
[1:07:03] who you might be
[1:07:05] but I do pretty good I'm thankful for
[1:07:08] songs I I sing all week long and I I get
[1:07:12] amazed at how I can remember the words
[1:07:14] till I get here have you ever had that
[1:07:16] happen to you but anyway it's a special
[1:07:18] day uh there there are some unclear
[1:07:23] things those of you who have studied the
[1:07:24] message of the hour for many years like
[1:07:27] we have uh brother Branham sometimes
[1:07:30] describes it as being in the cabin and
[1:07:33] other times he describes it as being in
[1:07:35] the cave and uh there is thought that he
[1:07:39] might have used the word cabin to throw
[1:07:42] people off because he did have a hidden
[1:07:45] cave that he uh met with the Lord in in
[1:07:49] Green's Mill Indiana
[1:07:52] and uh there were many people who
[1:07:55] believed that that should always remain
[1:07:57] a secret but my good friend brother
[1:07:59] George Smith was not one of those people
[1:08:01] he thought that everybody ought to know
[1:08:04] know it and have a chance to see it so
[1:08:06] he went and videoed it how many of you
[1:08:08] have ever seen that video let me see
[1:08:10] your hand this happened many years ago
[1:08:13] it's very interesting this cave there
[1:08:15] was a pyramid-shaped rock that comes
[1:08:17] down out of the ceiling and there's
[1:08:20] quite a table there where brother
[1:08:22] Branham said sometime he laid on that
[1:08:24] like a bed and God met with him many
[1:08:28] times he he describes though a light
[1:08:31] bulb in one of the tellings so it's
[1:08:33] possible that it took place in the cave
[1:08:36] I would like to read this I know it's
[1:08:38] not as interesting to some of you
[1:08:40] but I'm afraid that if Jesus tarries
[1:08:43] there will be fewer and fewer people who
[1:08:45] talk about these outstanding historical
[1:08:48] things that have taken place in our day
[1:08:50] so I'd like to read this to you in a
[1:08:54] paragraph one I don't have they don't
[1:08:56] have it uh from that message prayer line
[1:08:58] it took place in West Palm Beach Florida
[1:09:01] he said thank you good evening friends
[1:09:03] and you may be seated if you will about
[1:09:06] seven years ago on May the 7th 1946
[1:09:10] Greens Mill Indiana there was an angel
[1:09:13] came into the room where I was at a man
[1:09:17] walking he didn't have wings he was just
[1:09:19] a big man had a white garment down to
[1:09:22] the feet and he said to me that I was
[1:09:24] born to pray for sick people and I told
[1:09:27] him I was uneducated illiterate and I
[1:09:30] wasn't able to go
[1:09:32] he said that I would be praying for
[1:09:34] kings and monarchs sometimes brother
[1:09:37] Branham used the word potentates
[1:09:40] uh here I am uh uh uh and a message
[1:09:44] around the world a message that would
[1:09:47] bring the second coming of Christ it was
[1:09:49] near and I told him I couldn't do it and
[1:09:52] he told me then for me to put my hands
[1:09:55] on the people and it would be told me
[1:09:56] what was wrong he said then if you'll be
[1:09:59] sincere it'll come to pass that you'll
[1:10:01] even know the secrets of the Heart by
[1:10:04] this they will believe and I said well
[1:10:07] that's what I was praying about I didn't
[1:10:09] understand it remember he was
[1:10:12] questioning his Pastor concerning this
[1:10:15] gift and many told him it was of the
[1:10:18] devil can you imagine many told him said
[1:10:21] that's of the devil you better not do
[1:10:23] things like that brother Roy Moore was
[1:10:26] his pastor and it was a Baptist Church
[1:10:29] but it had had a lot of Pentecostal
[1:10:32] flavor in it when you when you think
[1:10:34] Baptists don't think southern baptist it
[1:10:37] was never a Southern Baptist Church it
[1:10:40] was always livelier than that but they
[1:10:43] didn't understand these gifts and
[1:10:45] brother Branham didn't understand them
[1:10:47] and who was he going to talk to about it
[1:10:49] and so he'd been asking questions about
[1:10:52] it here stood the angel of the Lord to
[1:10:55] confirm to him that his ministry was
[1:10:58] certainly to be used he goes on well
[1:11:02] that's what I've been praying about I
[1:11:03] didn't understand it and he referred me
[1:11:06] the angel of the Lord referred for the
[1:11:08] Branham to the scriptures about Jesus
[1:11:11] knowing Philip what he did before he
[1:11:14] come and got in the prayer line Jesus
[1:11:16] told him you're a Believer I said how do
[1:11:19] you know I was a Believer a man in whom
[1:11:21] there is no Gaul remember he said before
[1:11:24] Philip called you when you were under
[1:11:26] the tree I saw you he said you're the
[1:11:29] son of God
[1:11:31] brother random said you believe he sent
[1:11:33] me to do that you do you do with all
[1:11:36] your heart then I'll be able to help you
[1:11:37] he's about to have a prayer line
[1:11:39] I'll be able to help you if you'll he
[1:11:42] told me
[1:11:43] if you'll get the people to believe you
[1:11:45] and then be sincere when you pray
[1:11:47] nothing will stand before your prayer
[1:11:50] that's a powerful promise
[1:11:53] of that promise as the bride of Christ
[1:11:54] wasn't just two brother Branham that was
[1:11:57] part of his commission but it's also for
[1:12:00] you you can have what you ask
[1:12:02] how do you know that because Jesus said
[1:12:04] so how many of you believe what Jesus
[1:12:07] said
[1:12:07] and he's asking the people you believe
[1:12:09] that with all your heart now look this
[1:12:12] way he said there he here here he is
[1:12:17] you who seen the picture we when we meet
[1:12:20] at the day of judgment that angel isn't
[1:12:23] standing two foot from where I'm
[1:12:25] standing right now that's right now in
[1:12:28] the name of Jesus Christ I take
[1:12:30] jurisdiction over every spirit in this
[1:12:33] room and may almighty God who raised up
[1:12:36] the son send back his Spirit into his
[1:12:39] Prophet to represent him may he see it
[1:12:43] may he see to it that it is manifested
[1:12:48] tonight I love the way that brother
[1:12:50] Branham put the responsibility on him
[1:12:53] it's up to him and many times he would
[1:12:57] say well we don't have to keep talking
[1:13:00] about it he is here he's just stepped in
[1:13:04] the building that's what you feel
[1:13:06] sometime when the presence of the Lord
[1:13:08] is moving you're feeling the convergence
[1:13:12] everybody look this way
[1:13:14] you're feeling the convergence of that
[1:13:17] Heavenly realm coming near to us and uh
[1:13:21] for the bride that membrane is very thin
[1:13:24] between this Dimension and the next and
[1:13:27] we should be expecting
[1:13:30] we should be expecting to encounter the
[1:13:34] supernatural amen we should expect
[1:13:37] angels to show up
[1:13:40] I'm not charismatic and I don't call and
[1:13:42] tell Angels what to do I know there are
[1:13:45] a lot of those especially women speakers
[1:13:47] and preachers out there that seem to
[1:13:50] have a special uh way about commanding
[1:13:53] angels but I don't see that in the word
[1:13:55] I don't see that it's our responsibility
[1:13:58] or authority to tell Angels what to do
[1:14:01] we just talk to him
[1:14:05] and he sends angels
[1:14:07] Lord I'm not why in the world would I go
[1:14:10] down to the try to find a middle man
[1:14:12] when I can go straight to the dispatcher
[1:14:15] the Holy Ghost is the dispatcher he just
[1:14:18] sends them I'm thankful I feel them
[1:14:22] I feel those angels
[1:14:24] I know they're here and there's more to
[1:14:27] the Heavenly Host than just angels
[1:14:30] there's four living creatures that that
[1:14:32] operate around the bride of Christ as
[1:14:35] well and uh things that we just hardly
[1:14:38] don't know anything about won't you be
[1:14:40] excited one day to encounter in that
[1:14:43] eternity all the different hosts of
[1:14:46] Heaven that God has created and to find
[1:14:48] out that they were with us
[1:14:50] to find out that sometime they were
[1:14:52] sitting on the hood of our automobile
[1:14:55] and we couldn't see them but they were
[1:14:57] sitting right on the roof of the car to
[1:14:59] protect us to keep us safe
[1:15:02] so many times we could have left here
[1:15:06] hello
[1:15:08] we could have left here well let me move
[1:15:10] on I don't want to bog down just yet
[1:15:14] uh today is a birthday of a very dear
[1:15:18] friend of mine a very faithful friend I
[1:15:21] don't know that he would be watching
[1:15:23] this service this morning but I I think
[1:15:26] that if he doesn't he may go back and
[1:15:28] see it again
[1:15:29] uh he has was watching Tuesday night but
[1:15:33] today is brother Wilson hembree's
[1:15:35] birthday I'm not going to tell how many
[1:15:38] because he looks a very strong for his
[1:15:42] age and I'm not going to pull that on
[1:15:43] him when he's not here to to make a joke
[1:15:46] because if he was here he'd make it
[1:15:48] funny but I want to say happy birthday
[1:15:50] to him today tomorrow is May the 8th I
[1:15:55] always remember May the 7th as the
[1:15:57] commissioning date of brother branham's
[1:15:59] Ministry and uh Paul Keith used to talk
[1:16:03] about the importance of remembering your
[1:16:05] commission when you were commissioned
[1:16:07] when God called you to do what you're
[1:16:09] doing right now and so I like to
[1:16:12] remember the commissioning date but also
[1:16:14] a lot to remember May the 8th the next
[1:16:16] day that's the day that God took brother
[1:16:19] Branham beyond the curtain of time and
[1:16:22] let him see what it's going to be like
[1:16:24] when we get there those beautiful saints
[1:16:28] of God come out to greet him our
[1:16:30] precious brother my my uh there were the
[1:16:35] Saints gathered with the messengers to
[1:16:37] the ages and I think that's just a
[1:16:40] wonderful thing to think about it has
[1:16:42] encouraged me many times and brother
[1:16:44] Branham said it encouraged him to press
[1:16:46] on
[1:16:47] when he saw that it encouraged him to
[1:16:50] keep pressing toward
[1:16:52] eternity and then on May the 10th what
[1:16:55] day is that is that Wednesday or
[1:16:57] Thursday
[1:16:58] on Wednesday
[1:17:00] is uh sister emiko's birthday so we want
[1:17:05] to say happy birthday all the way to
[1:17:07] Japan God bless you Sister emiko and
[1:17:12] happy birthday to you and we thank God
[1:17:16] for her faithfulness and it's also Sarah
[1:17:20] yantis's birthday so it's a day that we
[1:17:23] can remember her and lift her up to the
[1:17:25] Lord I like to use people's birthdays as
[1:17:29] a day I pray for people a lot but I like
[1:17:32] to
[1:17:33] specifically if I almost said it like
[1:17:36] brother Green in all the years I knew
[1:17:39] him I never heard him say specifically
[1:17:42] he always said pacifically
[1:17:45] he thought it had something to do with
[1:17:47] the Pacific Ocean I think he said
[1:17:49] pacifically but I like to use their
[1:17:52] birthday specifically as an opportunity
[1:17:54] to pray for them I want to tell you
[1:17:56] something Jesus Christ
[1:17:59] the same
[1:18:03] amen I want to tell you that
[1:18:05] Jesus Christ the saying yesterday

[1:27:15] let's all do the same thing you that are
[1:27:17] able let's stand
[1:27:20] I want to say
[1:27:22] while you're doing it
[1:27:24] it's good sometime to be in one mind in
[1:27:26] one Accord
[1:27:28] I want to say that
[1:27:30] I had an opportunity this week brother
[1:27:32] Austin to hear your message
[1:27:36] in Kentucky
[1:27:38] Arkansas
[1:27:40] it's coming
[1:27:42] in Arkansas it was brother Austin Hodges
[1:27:46] first sermon and he did a very very fine
[1:27:49] job
[1:27:50] very fine job I might say to you though
[1:27:54] brother while we're here
[1:27:56] you're going to get in trouble quoting
[1:27:58] me
[1:28:01] you better just stick with the prophet
[1:28:04] or quote Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:28:07] but I'll tell you when you start saying
[1:28:09] my pastor Stephen Shelley said you're
[1:28:12] going to get in trouble in a hurry
[1:28:15] uh but I smiled a big smile I said he
[1:28:18] loves me he's proud of me he doesn't
[1:28:21] know that he's uh biting off his nose
[1:28:24] biting his face he doesn't know he's
[1:28:26] getting in trouble but anyway you did an
[1:28:28] outstanding job I'm not going to say
[1:28:31] what they said
[1:28:32] for your first time I'm going to say you
[1:28:35] did an outstanding job and I believe
[1:28:38] that the Lord was with you and I believe
[1:28:40] there's only one way up from I mean only
[1:28:42] one direction from here and that's up
[1:28:45] and uh you you just don't ever lose that
[1:28:49] that uh holy reverence that little bit
[1:28:52] of nervousness that you get when you
[1:28:55] know that you have the responsibility to
[1:28:58] speak to the elect lady
[1:29:01] what a privilege it is to address the
[1:29:05] elect lady the Bride of Jesus Christ the
[1:29:09] wife of the most high God it's a it's a
[1:29:12] powerful responsibility
[1:29:14] and I want to say also
[1:29:17] before we go to first Thessalonians
[1:29:19] chapter 4 15-17
[1:29:22] I want to say also that the second
[1:29:24] podcast is getting a tremendous amount
[1:29:27] of traction
[1:29:29] it went live this week on on Tuesday I
[1:29:32] believe
[1:29:33] and uh it's already had uh four or five
[1:29:37] almost 500 views on YouTube and it's
[1:29:40] making its rounds on Facebook it is on
[1:29:45] the app you can find it under podcast
[1:29:47] it's on Spotify it's on Apple podcast if
[1:29:53] you have apple podcast on your phone you
[1:29:56] can subscribe and you can get a
[1:29:58] notification when a new one comes out I
[1:30:01] don't know where Joshua is going for
[1:30:03] number three but he'll be getting that
[1:30:06] together we'll try to release one a
[1:30:09] month
[1:30:09] and uh we already have so many so many
[1:30:14] messages and inboxes and emails and many
[1:30:18] people are are asking that he kindly
[1:30:22] allow me to be a guest from time to time
[1:30:26] and they somebody said that's here this
[1:30:30] morning said I see a part three coming
[1:30:32] right up the road there and uh so there
[1:30:35] must be some more to tell but you know
[1:30:37] God's using it in a profound way a young
[1:30:40] man reached out to me yesterday I
[1:30:42] haven't heard from him in 25 years and
[1:30:45] he reached out to say I was so blessed
[1:30:48] and uh had another another uh dear old
[1:30:52] friend reach out I might not have seen
[1:30:55] him in in 25 years and he said it was a
[1:30:59] blessing because I lived some of those
[1:31:01] early moments that you were telling
[1:31:03] about and I saw some of those things and
[1:31:06] so you know God's just using whatever we
[1:31:08] give him
[1:31:09] he'll use whatever we do for him it's
[1:31:12] not all easy there's work involved I
[1:31:15] appreciate Joshua I appreciate Hawk
[1:31:18] all the work that they that they do I
[1:31:21] appreciate you people for giving us the
[1:31:23] studio you gave it to us you gave to the
[1:31:25] Lord and the Lord provided that
[1:31:28] and we have a host of invitations now in
[1:31:32] the last month or so I have seven or
[1:31:35] eight on the list I don't know when we
[1:31:37] would ever go
[1:31:39] I like staying
[1:31:41] there was a time I like to go but now I
[1:31:44] like staying but I don't want to miss
[1:31:46] any of the of the appointments that the
[1:31:48] Lord has for me I'll tell you that right
[1:31:50] now I want to be where he would have me
[1:31:52] to be I I heard from an old friend this
[1:31:55] week
[1:31:56] sister Rogan Hill
[1:31:58] she reached out from Norway and she said
[1:32:01] I am
[1:32:03] overseeing a guest house in the Negev
[1:32:06] Desert of Israel
[1:32:08] and I would like to invite you and your
[1:32:10] wife to come and stay as our guest as my
[1:32:12] guest in this home for some days and
[1:32:16] enjoy the Negev part of Israel well I
[1:32:20] tell you that's right up my alley it's
[1:32:22] actually on the caboots where where uh
[1:32:25] Ben Gurion is buried the first one of
[1:32:29] the one of the first Prime Ministers not
[1:32:30] the first but one of the first let's
[1:32:32] thank God for these musicians
[1:32:35] praise God and
[1:32:41] I feel like you're in a hurry
[1:32:45] and that's not too good
[1:32:48] what did I call him sister what did I
[1:32:51] say
[1:32:53] more well sir for those thank you for
[1:32:58] for catching that
[1:32:59] Roy Davis was brother
[1:33:03] maybe it'd be better that they looked
[1:33:05] for Roy Moore
[1:33:07] uh but Roy Davis was the name of the
[1:33:10] pastor there of that of that Tabernacle
[1:33:12] where brother Branham was when he was
[1:33:15] asking those questions what is this
[1:33:17] that's happening to me thank you for for
[1:33:20] helping me stay right
[1:33:22] now you may be in a hurry I feel like
[1:33:25] taking my time so I don't know how we're
[1:33:27] going to get along today you feel like
[1:33:29] hurrying I feel like just relaxing just
[1:33:32] just really taking my time
[1:33:35] so I don't know how this is going to
[1:33:36] turn out
[1:33:38] I know one thing I'm not gonna drag you
[1:33:40] all the way you're going to have to work
[1:33:42] too
[1:33:43] you're gonna have to work too if you
[1:33:45] want us to go somewhere
[1:33:46] this will be very familiar to some of
[1:33:48] you but I feel like that late fall early
[1:33:52] winter
[1:33:53] of this year God is going to speak to us
[1:33:56] in some profound ways from his word
[1:34:00] help us to go a little deeper than what
[1:34:02] we have gone as a congregation
[1:34:04] and so he commissioned me then to to to
[1:34:08] go over some of these strong points that
[1:34:10] have been made in the last few years to
[1:34:13] get us ready for what we might it's good
[1:34:15] to have a foundation
[1:34:17] and for those of you who don't think
[1:34:19] that well you're just wrong it's very
[1:34:22] very good to have a foundation in the
[1:34:24] word in the message of the hour
[1:34:27] or you you may ask a question you may
[1:34:29] get more than you bargained for so let's
[1:34:31] get this Foundation right first
[1:34:33] Thessalonians chapter 4 God bless all
[1:34:36] the streamers
[1:34:39] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:34:43] the Lord
[1:34:44] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:34:50] the coming of the Lord
[1:34:52] shall not prevent them which are asleep
[1:34:58] for the Lord himself
[1:35:02] not another
[1:35:04] the Lord himself
[1:35:07] not an angel
[1:35:11] the Lord himself
[1:35:14] the angel of the Covenant
[1:35:16] if you want to say angel
[1:35:18] but the Lord himself shall descend
[1:35:22] that's come down from heaven
[1:35:25] with a
[1:35:27] Shout
[1:35:28] with the voice of the archangel
[1:35:32] and with the Trump of god let's read
[1:35:36] that again for the Lord himself shall
[1:35:39] descend from heaven with a child with
[1:35:42] the voice of the Archangel and with the
[1:35:45] Trump of God that's the final Trump
[1:35:49] and the dead in Christ shall
[1:35:54] they shall rise first good thank you for
[1:35:57] helping me then we which are alive and
[1:36:00] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:36:03] them in the clouds to meet the Lord in
[1:36:08] the air we don't meet him on the Earth
[1:36:12] we meet him in the clouds
[1:36:15] because he doesn't come and touch the
[1:36:17] Earth in that moment he does come and
[1:36:20] touch the Earth his foot his feet will
[1:36:25] one day stand again on the Mount of
[1:36:27] Olives physically but that is the second
[1:36:31] coming this is the rapture resurrection
[1:36:34] that we're talking about today to meet
[1:36:37] the Lord in the air and oh my think
[1:36:41] about this last phrase and so shall we
[1:36:47] and so shall we
[1:36:50] with the Lord bow your head father you
[1:36:53] are so good to us
[1:36:56] we thank you for your faithfulness to us
[1:37:00] we thank you for what you did in this
[1:37:02] earth one generation ago
[1:37:05] we thank you for what you are doing
[1:37:07] today we thank you in advance for what
[1:37:11] you will do in the future because to us
[1:37:14] you are Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:37:18] and today and forever Lord I need you
[1:37:23] today I need you to settle the the the
[1:37:27] issues at hand I need you to speak to us
[1:37:31] from your word
[1:37:34] Lord would you supply the ice have
[1:37:39] that is necessary to see
[1:37:42] Lord anoint the note takers
[1:37:46] that they might be able to take notes
[1:37:48] and never miss a Beat
[1:37:50] because it's most important their faith
[1:37:54] pool so anoint them in their recording
[1:38:00] Lord let there be no hindrance
[1:38:03] we come against every Spirit of
[1:38:07] Witchcraft in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:38:11] every rebellious Spirit bow
[1:38:15] you must bow
[1:38:18] to the authority of Jesus Christ
[1:38:23] Lord let your people receive what you
[1:38:26] have laid aside for them this day we ask
[1:38:30] this in the name above every name the
[1:38:33] name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:38:36] amen
[1:38:38] and amen you may be seated is this too
[1:38:42] loud out there
[1:38:47] we are now closer
[1:38:51] to the reality of first Thessalonians
[1:38:54] chapter 4.
[1:38:55] the entirety of those verses than we
[1:38:58] have ever been before
[1:39:00] some of it is practically behind us
[1:39:04] we are walking in some of it now and
[1:39:07] some of it lies just ahead in the future
[1:39:11] is that right
[1:39:14] so close
[1:39:16] that a hand of Faith could reach out and
[1:39:19] put a finger on it it's that close to us
[1:39:22] in this hour and we have so much to be
[1:39:25] thankful for there was once a time that
[1:39:28] our church taught us
[1:39:31] that everything happened in the blink of
[1:39:33] an eye
[1:39:35] we just took that scripture right out of
[1:39:37] its context and believed what we were
[1:39:39] told and we just saw that in a blinking
[1:39:43] of an eye in the twinkling of an eye
[1:39:45] it'll all be done but the Apostle Paul
[1:39:49] remember he was chosen as a mouthpiece
[1:39:53] for the angel to the first church age to
[1:39:58] the Ephesian Church age so when we go to
[1:40:02] the Book of Revelation and we read about
[1:40:05] the seven churches that were in Asia
[1:40:08] Minor and we read that each one of them
[1:40:11] had an angel and that angel had a voice
[1:40:15] and that voice brought a message to that
[1:40:19] particular Church they were all
[1:40:22] contemporaries of one another but
[1:40:25] something much more prophetic and
[1:40:27] something much more profound was taking
[1:40:30] place in that hour because the word of
[1:40:34] the Lord was not just coming to a local
[1:40:36] assembly a local church where the local
[1:40:39] pastor and a local congregation but it
[1:40:42] was also a word from the Lord for ages
[1:40:46] to come
[1:40:47] is that right you can hear that in the
[1:40:51] revelation of Jesus Christ series if
[1:40:54] you're ever not sure about something you
[1:40:58] read in the church age book I suggest
[1:41:00] you go back to the revelation of Jesus
[1:41:03] Christ series and get your foundation
[1:41:06] there because to me if it's not there I
[1:41:11] I I I have to look at it two or three
[1:41:13] times and run it through the message
[1:41:16] before I can swallow it all because I
[1:41:19] smell quite a bit of Lee veil in the
[1:41:23] church age book and he was not an angel
[1:41:26] messenger
[1:41:27] it's all right you don't have to say
[1:41:29] anything
[1:41:30] Amen brother he was not chosen to speak
[1:41:35] for the angel of the Lord to laodicea a
[1:41:39] great great Theologian but not the voice
[1:41:43] of the angel
[1:41:45] so I I want to be able to take what I
[1:41:47] read there when I know others have
[1:41:49] helped to work it out grammarize it it's
[1:41:53] one thing to add commas and periods and
[1:41:56] and sputters and things take that out
[1:41:59] but it's another thing to interpret
[1:42:02] I don't want to be that person see you
[1:42:05] understand what I'm trying to say some
[1:42:07] of you do so get that revelation of
[1:42:10] Jesus Christ series out sometime and
[1:42:12] listen to it because it will really
[1:42:14] bless you uh each of these Church ages
[1:42:17] each of these churches of Asia Minor
[1:42:20] they also represented seven periods of
[1:42:23] time what we call the seven Church ages
[1:42:27] we are coming to the end and some of us
[1:42:30] have already transposed uh translated uh
[1:42:34] into that lap over of the bright age but
[1:42:38] we would call this church age for the
[1:42:41] church at large laodicea is that right
[1:42:43] Paul was not a messenger to laodicea
[1:42:46] brother Branham was not a messenger to
[1:42:48] Ephesus
[1:42:51] each message
[1:42:54] had a messenger to speak for the angel
[1:43:00] you see I see these angels as angels
[1:43:04] chosen
[1:43:06] even as the seven spirits
[1:43:09] even as the seven candles
[1:43:12] even as a seven lamps of Fire
[1:43:15] standing Before the Throne of the Lord
[1:43:18] and they had to have an Earthly voice
[1:43:20] somebody had to be the microphone or
[1:43:23] Hallelujah
[1:43:24] your pastor needs to be a microphone
[1:43:27] sometime your assistant pastor the
[1:43:30] ministers that you choose to listen to
[1:43:32] they have to be a microphone sometime to
[1:43:36] amplify what God would say to the church
[1:43:38] today I believe in the fifo ministry I
[1:43:42] want you to know that I believe there
[1:43:43] are apostles today not just missionaries
[1:43:47] that's not the biblical definition of an
[1:43:50] apostle you've got to take what brother
[1:43:52] random said about an apostle and then
[1:43:54] you've got to take what the scripture
[1:43:55] said an apostle was you've got to get it
[1:43:58] all in there it it yes an apostle is a
[1:44:01] Setter in order he said it's one who
[1:44:04] puts things in order and if we ever
[1:44:06] needed order we needed in this hour
[1:44:09] are you going to help me today
[1:44:13] I can tell you this is not to tantalize
[1:44:15] your flesh but it might help your spirit
[1:44:18] to grow if you're willing to stick it
[1:44:21] out
[1:44:22] if you don't want to hear that then go
[1:44:24] back and hear what the Lord said to us
[1:44:26] prophetically today it's time to get our
[1:44:28] heart pure and to get her hands clear
[1:44:31] clean before the Lord because one of
[1:44:34] these days we're going to see that book
[1:44:36] of Acts like never before
[1:44:40] operating Among Us that Supernatural
[1:44:43] power the same power that moved among
[1:44:45] the apostles it not only gave sight to
[1:44:48] the blind it not only gave Supernatural
[1:44:51] power to the ministers to shake off the
[1:44:53] serpents that bite them in the fire but
[1:44:56] it also put an ananias in the Sapphira
[1:44:59] on the ground
[1:45:02] so it's a serious hour that we're living
[1:45:04] in I'd be afraid to do what some people
[1:45:06] do live like they want to live all week
[1:45:09] and then you know trample right up to
[1:45:12] the throne and think you know get in on
[1:45:15] our coattails here
[1:45:16] and think that they can just go running
[1:45:18] right up without any consideration for
[1:45:21] the life you've lived all week
[1:45:23] I believe in justification I believe in
[1:45:26] the power of the blood I believe in
[1:45:28] being covered in his righteousness but
[1:45:30] when you fall short of the glory of God
[1:45:32] you've got to repent and you've got to
[1:45:35] be careful
[1:45:37] because fools will walk with hob-nailed
[1:45:40] shoes Where Angels Fear to trod
[1:45:44] I'd be afraid to carry on like some
[1:45:46] people carry I'd be afraid to come to
[1:45:49] the house of God and sit and Grumble and
[1:45:51] murmur and complain in my seat
[1:45:54] ah it it would behoove us not to be that
[1:45:59] kind of a people in the last days we
[1:46:03] should not be bound by the spirit of
[1:46:06] laodicea we should be translated into
[1:46:10] the authority of the bride's day
[1:46:12] for this is the bride's coming this is
[1:46:16] the bride coming of the Lord
[1:46:19] we've had a word coming
[1:46:22] now this is the bride coming
[1:46:25] and right around the corner is going to
[1:46:27] be the bridegroom coming
[1:46:30] in that wonderful
[1:46:32] so we we really want the Lord to just
[1:46:35] have his way
[1:46:36] I do in this hour I want him to have his
[1:46:40] way three phases of rapture let's get
[1:46:42] this in
[1:46:43] three phases of rapture not just a
[1:46:45] batting of an eye
[1:46:47] not just in a in a in a nanosecond they
[1:46:51] say but a process
[1:46:53] there is a culmination that will take
[1:46:57] place in the twinkling of an eye but
[1:47:00] there's a whole lot that takes place
[1:47:01] scripturally before the eye twinkles
[1:47:04] because first the Lord must ascend from
[1:47:08] heaven with a shout
[1:47:11] how about you give me Revelation 10 and
[1:47:14] verse 1. let's look at that you I didn't
[1:47:16] tell you to get it so this is a labor of
[1:47:20] love
[1:47:21] please grab it for us
[1:47:23] Revelation 10 1 if your Bible is Handy
[1:47:26] you look it up
[1:47:28] have it there and I saw another Mighty
[1:47:32] Angel come down from heaven clothed with
[1:47:36] a cloud and if you want to know who he
[1:47:39] is
[1:47:39] and a rainbow upon his hand
[1:47:43] this is not an ordinary angel
[1:47:46] this is not Gabriel come on this is not
[1:47:50] Michael
[1:47:52] Raphael or some of the other archangels
[1:47:55] as their call this is a different kind
[1:47:57] of Angel altogether he has come clothed
[1:48:01] with a cloud to identify how he will
[1:48:04] come in word form with a cloud
[1:48:08] and he has a rainbow upon his head he is
[1:48:12] identifying himself as the angel of the
[1:48:16] Covenant referred to in the Old
[1:48:19] Testament as the angel of the Lord and
[1:48:22] in this dispensation of Grace we
[1:48:25] understand he is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:48:30] this is not brother Branham
[1:48:33] this is not some some angel with wings
[1:48:36] or something like that some other
[1:48:38] beautiful this is the Lord another
[1:48:41] Mighty Angel come down from heaven
[1:48:43] clothed with a cloud a rainbow upon his
[1:48:46] head and his face as it were the son and
[1:48:51] his feet as pillars of Fire
[1:48:57] is there anybody in here don't raise
[1:48:59] your hand
[1:49:00] is there anybody in here that doubts
[1:49:02] that that was Jesus
[1:49:06] would you say it if you did
[1:49:12] if you're going to say it say it to me
[1:49:16] don't find some weak Church person
[1:49:20] and question me to them
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:26] you come talk to me
[1:49:28] I'll tell you
[1:49:30] you don't have to believe me but but
[1:49:31] I'll tell you
[1:49:32] in Revelation chapter 1
[1:49:35] he's identified like this
[1:49:39] and in the midst verse 13 you don't have
[1:49:42] this either
[1:49:44] and in the midst of the seven
[1:49:45] candlesticks one like unto the son of
[1:49:49] man clothed with a garment down to the
[1:49:51] foot
[1:49:52] gird about the loins or the paps with a
[1:49:55] golden girdle
[1:49:57] next verse his head and his hairs were
[1:50:02] white like wool that's why that's snow
[1:50:05] he had come Church to represent himself
[1:50:08] as the faithful judge
[1:50:11] he came in a manner like Daniel saw him
[1:50:15] as the Ancient of Days anybody with me
[1:50:20] his hair white like wool as white as
[1:50:24] snow and his eyes
[1:50:26] were as a flame of fire
[1:50:30] when we hear fiery eyes we think about
[1:50:33] anger
[1:50:35] flashing his fiery eyes I want you to
[1:50:38] know that's not the only way he comes
[1:50:40] and he certainly didn't appear to John
[1:50:43] as one who was about to consume him that
[1:50:47] fiery eye that he appeared with to John
[1:50:50] was the passion it was fiery passion in
[1:50:54] his eyes for his bride
[1:50:57] his eyes burn
[1:51:00] with indignation toward those who reject
[1:51:03] the word of the Lord
[1:51:05] but to those who receive him to them he
[1:51:09] gave power to be the sons of God and he
[1:51:13] is jealous for you I don't know if
[1:51:16] anybody's listening I'm going to preach
[1:51:18] to brother Greely and the streamers then
[1:51:22] I want you to know that he loves you he
[1:51:26] is after you he is passionately in love
[1:51:32] with you
[1:51:34] I see that the message churches out
[1:51:37] there are some of them are breaking into
[1:51:40] a wonderful place of Praise I'm so
[1:51:43] thankful to see people praising the Lord
[1:51:46] again
[1:51:48] I've been waiting on them to praise him
[1:51:50] because he's worthy you got to get in
[1:51:54] that praise stage before you can move on
[1:51:58] because the bride isn't just jumping
[1:52:02] she's not just dancing I'm on a dance
[1:52:05] I'm going to jump
[1:52:07] amen that's praise
[1:52:09] praise is what we do with what we have
[1:52:12] to catch the Lord's attention and to
[1:52:15] love on him and tell him who we are but
[1:52:18] our ultimate goal is to bring him in the
[1:52:20] midst
[1:52:22] we want him to step in here and when he
[1:52:25] does you won't dance then
[1:52:30] when he does you won't jump just jump
[1:52:33] then
[1:52:35] when he does you want to fall down on
[1:52:37] his on your face at his feet and you'll
[1:52:41] want to say Lord like oil upon your feet
[1:52:45] like wine for you to drink
[1:52:49] so we praise our way into the holy of
[1:52:53] holies
[1:52:54] when we come into the holy of holies the
[1:52:58] glory of his person the kavod the heavy
[1:53:04] weighty presence of God begins to move
[1:53:08] on us and when it does it almost
[1:53:11] paralyzes us
[1:53:14] biblically speaking it puts people on
[1:53:17] their face
[1:53:19] they can hardly move
[1:53:21] when I had an experience Before the
[1:53:24] Throne I remember how heavy my head was
[1:53:30] my head my neck my head felt like it
[1:53:35] weighed five tons
[1:53:39] when it came into my heart to look up
[1:53:43] I couldn't raise my head high enough to
[1:53:47] see anything but his feet
[1:53:50] because his kavod his heavy weighty
[1:53:54] glory and presence was there and in my
[1:53:58] in my unworthiness
[1:54:01] I didn't dare
[1:54:04] I hear people talk about experiences I
[1:54:07] used to hear it more than I do now
[1:54:08] because I spoke in different circles
[1:54:26] let's pray would you stand and let's
[1:54:30] pray for sister Royale
[1:54:32] she's not feeling well sister Weems
[1:54:35] we want to go to the Lord in prayer for
[1:54:37] her they're going to just go and see
[1:54:39] about checking her out I think let's go
[1:54:42] to the Lord in prayer for her she's
[1:54:43] already gone I think has already slipped
[1:54:46] out and and they're going to see about
[1:54:48] her let's just go to the Lord in prayer
[1:54:49] father we thank you for the confirmation
[1:54:53] of your word that you are the same
[1:54:58] yesterday
[1:54:59] today and forever our hearts look to you
[1:55:05] in this moment and we know that you are
[1:55:09] ever more God the same we preach you as
[1:55:13] the same because we believe you are the
[1:55:17] same and so Lord right now reach down
[1:55:21] and touch our sister in the name of the
[1:55:23] Lord Jesus Christ may it be that when
[1:55:26] they check her they find no reason that
[1:55:30] nothing has happened just some little
[1:55:32] fluke of the enemy to distract may it be
[1:55:36] that she's whole may it be that she is
[1:55:40] restored may it be that she is healed
[1:55:44] today for the glory of God we come
[1:55:47] against the works of the enemy we stand
[1:55:51] against the spirit of Darkness we come
[1:55:54] against the spirit of death in the name
[1:55:57] of Jesus we stand on the promise of your
[1:56:00] word and we declare her whole
[1:56:04] in the presence of God
[1:56:07] hold in the presence of God
[1:56:13] in the name of Jesus
[1:56:17] There's Something About This Moment
[1:56:20] that feels
[1:56:22] otherworldly
[1:56:24] thank you Jesus
[1:56:27] thank you Jesus let
[1:56:30] eternity break in on our midst
[1:56:43] [Music]
[1:56:45] foreign
[1:56:46] [Music]
[1:56:52] thank you Holy Ghost
[1:56:54] when we know not how to pray for even as
[1:56:57] we ought that holy spirit of God doth
[1:57:01] make intercession for us
[1:57:04] Jesus
[1:57:06] Jesus
[1:57:18] Hallelujah
[1:57:21] Hallelujah
[1:57:24] Hallelujah
[1:57:27] isn't he good
[1:57:29] let's give God praise
[1:57:32] let's praise him for the good report
[1:57:36] yes Lord
[1:57:38] [Applause]
[1:57:43] you may be seated
[1:57:51] those fiery eyes
[1:57:54] as a flames of fire
[1:57:57] I was in a meeting in Nashville
[1:58:00] Tennessee I haven't wrote here in the
[1:58:02] margin of my Bible
[1:58:04] on August the 1st
[1:58:07] 2006.
[1:58:09] I was in Nashville I think that was the
[1:58:13] time that I had an experience with the
[1:58:17] with the doves
[1:58:21] I'm pretty sure that was the same time
[1:58:25] my eyes were open in the meeting while
[1:58:27] someone else was speaking
[1:58:31] I only remember that I was sitting next
[1:58:34] to Ricky Skaggs does anybody know who
[1:58:35] that is
[1:58:37] Ricky Skaggs was sitting right next to
[1:58:40] me
[1:58:41] and I saw two
[1:58:44] pillars of light come down on the
[1:58:46] platform
[1:58:48] they looked about as big as
[1:58:51] I could reach around one on one side and
[1:58:55] one on the other side and and I said
[1:58:58] Lord what is that and he said you are
[1:59:01] seeing my fiery eyes
[1:59:04] of passion for my bride I am in love
[1:59:09] with my people
[1:59:12] I tell you
[1:59:13] it moved me
[1:59:16] when I was I don't know where I was
[1:59:19] exactly but I'll just go on in verse 15.
[1:59:23] and his feet like undefined brass as if
[1:59:27] they burned in a furnace and his voice
[1:59:30] as the sound of many Waters
[1:59:34] you know brother Branham talked about
[1:59:36] that sound of many Waters Brothers skip
[1:59:39] you're going to be all right
[1:59:41] are you all right are you that cold
[1:59:43] you want us to get you another blanket
[1:59:50] get him another blanket somebody
[1:59:53] somebody get him you're all right good
[1:59:56] good I'm glad to hear it
[1:59:59] his feet
[2:00:06] sound of many Waters brother random
[2:00:08] talks about that voice
[2:00:10] being as the sound of many Waters
[2:00:13] he talks about it being the voice of the
[2:00:16] ministry all those faithful ministers
[2:00:20] that have declared the truth down
[2:00:23] Through the Ages their their part can be
[2:00:27] heard in his voice as it sounds like
[2:00:31] many Waters I wanted you to see his eyes
[2:00:34] I wanted you to see his feet were like
[2:00:38] brass as if they burned in a furnace and
[2:00:41] I wanted you to see his voice then I
[2:00:44] want you to go back to Revelation 10 for
[2:00:46] just a moment read that verse 1 again
[2:00:49] and see if you can identify that to be
[2:00:53] the same person and saw a mighty Angel
[2:00:56] come down from heaven clothed with a
[2:00:58] cloud a rainbow upon his head his face
[2:01:01] as if it were the son and his feet as
[2:01:06] pillars of fire I believe that's him
[2:01:10] if you believe that's him say amen I
[2:01:13] believe that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:01:16] I believe that he was descending
[2:01:20] John was letting him see first
[2:01:23] Thessalonians 4 16 for the Lord himself
[2:01:26] shall descend from heaven how is he
[2:01:29] descending the scripture said in a shout
[2:01:34] what is a shout
[2:01:37] a shout is a noise
[2:01:41] it's a voice
[2:01:43] it comes for a purpose
[2:01:47] it wakes things up
[2:01:51] you believe that
[2:01:53] this is the word coming of Christ this
[2:01:56] is Christ coming in a message
[2:02:00] Christ coming in the fullness of his
[2:02:04] word it's like a shout it wakes up a
[2:02:08] sleeping bride this is the Awakening of
[2:02:11] the Bride most of us didn't even know
[2:02:14] who we were until we heard a shout
[2:02:17] we just thought we were church members
[2:02:19] we just thought if we shook the
[2:02:21] preacher's hand and moved our letter
[2:02:23] from place to place we were a part of
[2:02:25] the church but then an eagle screamed
[2:02:29] then a shout came forth and a message
[2:02:32] sounded in our ears we realized that we
[2:02:36] might have been raised in a barnyard
[2:02:38] with chickens
[2:02:39] but we weren't chickens
[2:02:41] we were Eagles after all we weren't
[2:02:45] called to live in the lower elements of
[2:02:47] the Earth but to get up to a higher
[2:02:49] place did you hear the Lord calling us
[2:02:53] did you hear the Lord calling us to a
[2:02:56] higher place to ascend the hill of the
[2:02:59] Lord who'll hear what he has to say I
[2:03:02] will
[2:03:03] rearrange your life to get up where he
[2:03:06] is I will
[2:03:08] because everything looks different
[2:03:10] when you get up to where he is and you
[2:03:12] look back down on your problems what
[2:03:15] looked like a mountain now looks like a
[2:03:16] mole hill
[2:03:18] what looked like an impossibility looks
[2:03:21] like a great possibility when you get up
[2:03:23] to where he is
[2:03:25] the only thing you have to do is make
[2:03:27] sure you wash your hands
[2:03:29] and you give him your heart
[2:03:31] you can't cleanse your heart he can
[2:03:35] you just gotta give it to him you have
[2:03:38] to operate that realm in the realm of
[2:03:40] the soul and you have to say here's my
[2:03:42] will here's my mind here's my emotion
[2:03:46] you're not talking about the heart the
[2:03:48] blood pump he's talking about the seed
[2:03:50] of the emotions he said I want to
[2:03:53] cleanse that Lord here we are
[2:03:56] come on
[2:03:58] you don't know where you are do you here
[2:04:00] we are Lord
[2:04:01] this is that moment
[2:04:04] the Bible said he would do nothing
[2:04:07] nothing
[2:04:09] until he did something
[2:04:12] what is the something that he will do
[2:04:15] nothing until he does
[2:04:19] Amos 3 7 you got it Amos 3 7.
[2:04:24] surely the Lord God will do
[2:04:28] nothing but he reveileth his secret
[2:04:33] unto his
[2:04:35] servants
[2:04:37] the prophets
[2:04:40] that sounds familiar to me
[2:04:43] let's go down just a little bit further
[2:04:45] in Revelation 10.
[2:04:47] that sounds familiar to me
[2:04:50] look at verse 7. but in the days of the
[2:04:54] voice of the seventh angel
[2:04:58] when he shall begin to sound
[2:05:02] the mystery
[2:05:07] I'm sorry Dr Schofield
[2:05:09] it's singular
[2:05:11] the mystery of God should be finished
[2:05:16] as he hath declared to his servants
[2:05:20] plural the prophets plural
[2:05:25] Amos
[2:05:26] the Lord will do nothing
[2:05:28] but what he revealeth
[2:05:30] his secret unto his servants
[2:05:34] the prophets
[2:05:36] the purpose of brother branham's
[2:05:40] Ministry was to forerun the second
[2:05:44] coming of Jesus Christ if you're not
[2:05:48] fully persuaded of that you'll have a
[2:05:50] hard time eating some of the meals that
[2:05:52] I serve
[2:05:56] or that he serves through me
[2:05:58] somebody said do I have to believe that
[2:06:00] to come to this church you do not
[2:06:03] but don't be surprised if some of it
[2:06:05] just hangs on the vine
[2:06:07] because if you don't believe that you
[2:06:09] won't be able to completely see where we
[2:06:12] are in this hour
[2:06:14] so may God open your eyes if you haven't
[2:06:16] already seen that may you see it quickly
[2:06:18] his ministry was to forerun the second
[2:06:21] coming of Christ just like the ministry
[2:06:24] of John the Baptist was to forerun the
[2:06:28] first coming of Jesus Christ and here's
[2:06:31] what's so powerful about these two men
[2:06:33] John the Baptist you know nobody has
[2:06:35] problem with me saying that about John
[2:06:37] the Baptist
[2:06:40] but here's the similarity between these
[2:06:43] two men they were both full
[2:06:46] of the spirit and power of Elijah
[2:06:51] neither of them were Elijah
[2:06:56] Elisha
[2:06:58] had a double portion of Elijah's Spirit
[2:07:01] but he wasn't Elijah
[2:07:05] John the Baptist had the same spirit and
[2:07:08] power that Elijah had but he wasn't
[2:07:10] Elijah brother Branham functioned in the
[2:07:13] same power and anointing of John the
[2:07:16] Baptist or of Elijah we can say
[2:07:19] but he was not Elijah
[2:07:22] now sometimes around the message you'll
[2:07:24] hear people say things like the Elijah
[2:07:26] for our day I have no problem with that
[2:07:28] be Elijah for our day if you mean by
[2:07:31] that that he was a man chosen of God to
[2:07:36] operate in the spirit and power of
[2:07:38] Elijah now somebody said why does that
[2:07:41] matter why do we have to speak about the
[2:07:44] ministry of brother Branham why do we
[2:07:47] even have to mention it when we come to
[2:07:49] church I'd rather us not have to even
[2:07:52] talk about it well look at acts this is
[2:07:55] skipping ahead forgive me this is Acts
[2:07:57] chapter 3 and verse 23 this is why
[2:08:05] come on you cheaters
[2:08:08] I'm waiting on you to read it to
[2:08:10] yourself first
[2:08:14] let me get a breath
[2:08:25] I didn't write this verse
[2:08:30] this is not my opinion
[2:08:34] and it shall come and where was it found
[2:08:36] in the book of the acts of the Holy
[2:08:39] Spirit
[2:08:41] this is in the book of The Acts of the
[2:08:43] Apostles like the church calls it
[2:08:46] it's the book of the acts of the holy
[2:08:47] spirit in the lives of the Apostles
[2:08:50] and this Acts chapter 3 is a powerful
[2:08:52] chapter anyway and it shall come to pass
[2:08:55] that every soul which will not hear that
[2:08:57] Prophet shall be destroyed from among
[2:09:00] the people
[2:09:03] now just reading that I know there's a
[2:09:05] context there some of your head you can
[2:09:07] certainly read the whole chapter when
[2:09:09] you get home we're not putting it up
[2:09:12] I'm having a hard enough time keeping
[2:09:14] you with me now
[2:09:15] but you go home and read every bit of
[2:09:17] the Hat you will understand as you
[2:09:19] search Acts 3 23 and you kind of run a
[2:09:24] chain reference as I was meeting with
[2:09:27] Elias this week and talking to him about
[2:09:29] the way I study the scripture you kind
[2:09:32] of run a chain reference on that verse
[2:09:34] you'll find out that God's pretty
[2:09:36] particular about how people respond
[2:09:41] To His prophets
[2:09:45] now I always like to distinguish
[2:09:48] between a messenger prophet and a
[2:09:51] five-fold prophet but notice the book of
[2:09:54] Acts does not make that distinction and
[2:09:58] neither do many other places in the
[2:10:01] scripture so there's something about
[2:10:04] those who speak for him
[2:10:07] and the only way that you will be able
[2:10:10] to stay clear of faults
[2:10:13] prophets if you know what the word said
[2:10:18] you won't understand and discern that
[2:10:21] you have come in contact with a false
[2:10:24] prophet by studying false prophets I'm
[2:10:27] going to say it again
[2:10:28] you'll not be able to discern the
[2:10:31] difference between a true prophet and a
[2:10:33] false prophet by studying false prophets
[2:10:37] you'll only be able to discern the
[2:10:39] difference by studying a true prophet
[2:10:41] [Music]
[2:10:41] [Applause]
[2:10:44] you don't learn what is a genuine twenty
[2:10:46] dollar bill by spending your time
[2:10:48] examining a counterfeit twenty dollar
[2:10:50] bill
[2:10:57] on the w
[2:11:01] you know it's it's it's it's it's
[2:11:03] adequately named
[2:11:05] web
[2:11:08] well I'm preaching now
[2:11:10] it is a worldwide web
[2:11:13] you can get caught up in Google and
[2:11:15] spend a day
[2:11:23] I told my wife I'm sorry honey I'm she
[2:11:27] called me to dinner and I didn't jump up
[2:11:29] but I come in there pretty quick I said
[2:11:31] I'm I'm picking out my next getaway spot
[2:11:36] and I got carried away
[2:11:38] you follow one link if you think you
[2:11:40] found a good deal you're looking for
[2:11:41] another one you're looking for another
[2:11:42] one you're looking for another one
[2:11:43] because you can book in advance snag up
[2:11:46] some pretty good deals Say Amen
[2:11:49] so you can get in that web and never
[2:11:52] know how to get out
[2:11:54] and you know it's
[2:11:57] it's on the ministry of a profit or uh
[2:12:01] uh historical figure and they locked a
[2:12:04] point out all the flaws
[2:12:08] and all the mistakes it seems
[2:12:11] they like to talk about the times where
[2:12:14] he might have said 15 years ago when it
[2:12:17] was closer to 30.
[2:12:19] [Music]
[2:12:21] so what
[2:12:25] we used to travel with a man
[2:12:28] in different meetings with him and
[2:12:30] just about every time he got down from
[2:12:33] speaking we had to say well that really
[2:12:35] wasn't just the other day
[2:12:39] that was closer to about eight years ago
[2:12:43] you see if you spend any time in that
[2:12:46] Realm of the spirit there is no time
[2:12:48] there
[2:12:50] that was good
[2:12:52] and things can get a little blurry about
[2:12:55] when it really happened
[2:12:57] so if you want to know whether or not
[2:12:59] brother Branham had a genuine Ministry
[2:13:01] you don't get online and start trying to
[2:13:03] find the false prophets and see if he's
[2:13:05] acted like them or sounded like them why
[2:13:08] don't you get in the word and find some
[2:13:10] real ones
[2:13:12] and just start with Elijah
[2:13:15] amen so I do not believe that brother
[2:13:17] Brandon Was Elijah reincarnated
[2:13:21] or or the Elijah who would come and
[2:13:25] forerun uh the a Ministry there in uh in
[2:13:30] Revelation chapter 11 the two witnesses
[2:13:33] we're talking about a man like John the
[2:13:36] Baptist John the Baptist had his own
[2:13:38] Ministry but he was anointed
[2:13:41] with a spirit and power of Elijah what
[2:13:44] if I told you that I believe that the
[2:13:46] Bride of Jesus Christ not just brother
[2:13:48] Adam but what if I told you that I
[2:13:50] personally believe that the Bride of
[2:13:52] Jesus Christ is to be anointed
[2:13:55] with the spirit and power of Elijah
[2:13:58] and somebody said boil that down I'll
[2:14:00] boil it down in two words no compromise
[2:14:03] [Applause]
[2:14:06] there was no compromise in
[2:14:10] Elijah
[2:14:11] there was no compromise in John the
[2:14:14] Baptist
[2:14:15] he stood on the word
[2:14:17] and it cost him his head
[2:14:20] there was no compromise in William
[2:14:21] Branham
[2:14:23] and it cost him his affiliations
[2:14:28] we'll let you come and pray for our sick
[2:14:31] but we can't Turn You Loose to preacher
[2:14:33] Doctrine
[2:14:35] we'll use you to draw a crowd
[2:14:38] and then we'll sit you down and we'll do
[2:14:40] the preaching teaching come on now those
[2:14:43] are the kind of things that went on but
[2:14:45] nonetheless God was faithful to do
[2:14:47] exactly what he said he would do I want
[2:14:49] to show you Matthew excuse me I want to
[2:14:52] show you Malachi 4.
[2:14:55] verse 5 and 6.
[2:14:58] behold I God
[2:15:02] that's not Malachi the prophet that's
[2:15:05] God talking behold I God will send you
[2:15:09] you
[2:15:14] not just the nation of Israel
[2:15:18] you
[2:15:21] not just sister Meda
[2:15:24] you
[2:15:26] behold I will send you Elijah the
[2:15:29] prophet before the coming of the great
[2:15:32] and Dreadful day of the Lord
[2:15:37] and this is the division of his ministry
[2:15:42] he will come more than one time
[2:15:48] the first time he comes he will turn the
[2:15:52] heart of the fathers
[2:15:55] to the children
[2:15:58] those patriarchal fathers of the faith
[2:16:02] will have their hearts turned toward the
[2:16:06] Pentecostal Apostolic fathers Sons
[2:16:09] children
[2:16:11] the heart of the fathers to the children
[2:16:15] and that was a turning of the
[2:16:18] patriarchal hearts the hearts of the old
[2:16:21] Covenant the Hebrew people the Jewish
[2:16:24] people who walked in the way looking for
[2:16:27] the Messiah
[2:16:28] the first time the Elijah anointing
[2:16:31] falls on a man who is not Elijah in in
[2:16:35] New Testament times
[2:16:38] he will turn the hearts of the fathers
[2:16:41] to the children
[2:16:44] and the next time he will turn the
[2:16:47] hearts of the children
[2:16:49] to their fathers
[2:16:55] now in this verse we become the children
[2:17:00] and a word has come to restore us back
[2:17:03] to our book of Acts fathers our
[2:17:07] Apostolic fathers our Pentecostal
[2:17:10] fathers somebody said how can you get
[2:17:12] that because the scripture said that in
[2:17:14] New Testament we are to earnestly
[2:17:18] hello
[2:17:19] we are to earnestly
[2:17:22] contend
[2:17:25] for the faith
[2:17:29] that was what
[2:17:30] once delivered to the Saints so it's the
[2:17:34] same Spirit of Elijah
[2:17:37] but it comes to do two things
[2:17:39] it comes to turn the hearts of those who
[2:17:43] have clung to the old Covenant to the
[2:17:46] New Covenant
[2:17:51] somebody said what do you mean well let
[2:17:52] me give you the example because we're
[2:17:54] coming up on shovel old are you still
[2:17:55] here
[2:17:57] we're coming up on shavot
[2:18:00] and Shavuot is Pentecost 50 days
[2:18:06] we're nearly halfway through or more
[2:18:09] 50 days of the counting of the Omer
[2:18:13] from Feast of unleavened bread Passover
[2:18:16] up to Pentecost we call it shavot
[2:18:21] it celebrates the giving of the law to
[2:18:24] the old fathers
[2:18:27] and it celebrates the giving of the Holy
[2:18:30] Ghost
[2:18:31] on the day of Pentecost to the children
[2:18:35] there it is
[2:18:37] so when we celebrate chevot we're
[2:18:40] celebrating the giving of the law on
[2:18:43] Mount Sinai
[2:18:45] to Moses and the people but God chose
[2:18:49] it's interesting to know some of you may
[2:18:51] not know it's interesting to know that
[2:18:54] on the same day
[2:18:57] that God gave the law to Moses and the
[2:19:01] children of Israel many years later at
[2:19:04] the same time of the year
[2:19:06] on God's appointed calendar this time he
[2:19:10] doesn't give the law he gives the Holy
[2:19:13] Ghost
[2:19:15] Acts chapter 2 takes place at shavot
[2:19:19] so it reminds us of both the giving of
[2:19:23] the law of the word and the giving of
[2:19:26] the Spirit by the Holy Ghost
[2:19:28] so the first time that Spirit of Elijah
[2:19:31] returns in the newer Covenant or the New
[2:19:33] Testament it falls on a man by the name
[2:19:35] of John the Baptist and it's his
[2:19:38] ministry to get a hold of some of them
[2:19:40] old Pharisees and Sadducees those law
[2:19:44] keepers
[2:19:45] those who have put such heavy oppression
[2:19:49] on the Jewish people that they can't
[2:19:51] even worship God
[2:19:56] there was so much corruption
[2:19:59] in the second temple period among the
[2:20:01] priests
[2:20:02] that they had moved out of the common
[2:20:04] places in the city of Jerusalem and they
[2:20:07] had moved into the upper city where the
[2:20:10] aristocrats lived
[2:20:11] the priest had left the common people
[2:20:14] and they were living in palaces
[2:20:17] how do we know because we can go and
[2:20:19] take you we can take you to the ruins
[2:20:22] of the Palaces the wall w-o-h-l Museum
[2:20:28] what we call the burn house
[2:20:31] is in an area just across from the wall
[2:20:35] w-o-h-l Museum
[2:20:38] which is a huge building
[2:20:41] built on top of the ruins of the
[2:20:44] Priestly homes in the times of the
[2:20:47] second temple period and not only can
[2:20:50] you see the ruins of their of their
[2:20:52] elegant palaces but you can see the
[2:20:54] water jugs they drink from
[2:20:59] the archeology of that place
[2:21:03] is incredible
[2:21:05] I believe God preserved it
[2:21:07] so that people would know that by the
[2:21:10] time Jesus came on the scene the as you
[2:21:13] have seen him the chosen as you have
[2:21:15] seen in many Jewish
[2:21:18] scenes
[2:21:20] of films
[2:21:24] telling the story of Jesus he's always
[2:21:28] having trouble with her Sanhedrin
[2:21:32] are you still with me he's always having
[2:21:35] trouble with the Pharisees he's always
[2:21:37] having trouble with the scribes why
[2:21:39] because they had become so corrupt
[2:21:42] in trying to infringe laws
[2:21:47] some of which were no longer practical
[2:21:50] at that time
[2:21:53] okay
[2:21:55] like for instance when you put a big
[2:21:58] Camp of people together who travel from
[2:22:00] all over Israel to to hear Jesus preach
[2:22:05] you can't always keep enough separation
[2:22:09] between a woman who is
[2:22:13] having her cycle
[2:22:16] and other worshipers
[2:22:19] so there was a lot of contamination
[2:22:24] that was going on in that period of time
[2:22:28] and nobody took into consideration these
[2:22:32] are unprecedented times
[2:22:35] we're here to hear the Messiah
[2:22:39] and so there would be you know lepers
[2:22:43] would get too close and and uh there was
[2:22:47] hardly room to separate people
[2:22:50] there were all kinds of of laws being
[2:22:53] broken and sanitation laws being broken
[2:22:57] and if it was Passover somebody might
[2:23:00] have eaten out of a dish that had been
[2:23:03] used for leaven
[2:23:06] and instead of the religious I hope
[2:23:08] you're following me instead of the
[2:23:11] religious recognizing this is a
[2:23:13] visitation of God in the Earth
[2:23:16] they were going around like like
[2:23:19] religious snobs
[2:23:24] telling the people you've got to keep
[2:23:26] this you're you're going to hell if you
[2:23:29] don't keep the if you if you don't put
[2:23:32] the zitseed on with the right prayer
[2:23:37] and already in the second temple period
[2:23:40] they were already going through this big
[2:23:42] ceremony of washing the hands
[2:23:46] um Benjamin go out to the cabinet there
[2:23:48] and see if I have a
[2:23:49] a two-handled jug
[2:23:52] it's it'd be about this big
[2:23:55] and would have two handles on it I think
[2:23:57] it might be there I told you I felt like
[2:23:59] taking my time
[2:24:04] some of you won't show up around here
[2:24:06] Tuesday night so I might as well take
[2:24:07] Tuesday night's sermon down preach to
[2:24:09] you today
[2:24:11] it's there
[2:24:17] so this was a you know the Bible tells
[2:24:20] us if we read the ceremonial laws of the
[2:24:24] Old Testament it tells us that we should
[2:24:26] the priest washed his hand in the labor
[2:24:28] before he would go into the presence of
[2:24:31] God and so forth the Bible tells us we
[2:24:33] should wash our hands remember the
[2:24:34] Pharisees rebuked the disciples because
[2:24:36] they saw them eating without their hands
[2:24:39] being washed well honey if it was just
[2:24:41] going down to the river and washing your
[2:24:43] hands everybody could have done it but
[2:24:45] the by the second temple period they
[2:24:47] already had some kind of ritual and I'll
[2:24:49] be honest with you I can't remember
[2:24:50] exactly how it goes if it's left over
[2:24:52] right or right over left first
[2:24:54] but so I maybe do it wrong are you going
[2:24:57] to Stone me
[2:24:59] see but the water goes in you got two
[2:25:01] handles because you do like this then
[2:25:03] you do and then you do like that and
[2:25:04] then you come back and do it the other
[2:25:06] way
[2:25:07] so do you understand that if you're in a
[2:25:09] situation and you didn't bring your jug
[2:25:14] you might have been caught eating with
[2:25:16] dirty hands now don't forget now God's
[2:25:18] word said to wash your hands before you
[2:25:20] eat
[2:25:21] that was God's idea
[2:25:24] but man wasn't satisfied with God's idea
[2:25:27] he starts taking it a whole lot further
[2:25:29] and this is what they were doing the the
[2:25:31] fathers
[2:25:33] had no tolerance
[2:25:35] for anything that wasn't
[2:25:39] old
[2:25:43] it sounds like people around this
[2:25:44] message
[2:25:45] who think it can't be a true worship
[2:25:47] song
[2:25:48] if it was written any later than 1955
[2:25:52] couldn't be God
[2:25:58] and so God sent John the Baptist
[2:26:01] where the spirit and power of Elijah to
[2:26:04] try to turn the hearts of those old died
[2:26:08] in the wool fathers and show them yes
[2:26:15] but it fell onto a cold Stony heart
[2:26:18] and that's why you struggle to keep it
[2:26:21] and that's why you add all these fences
[2:26:24] around it because you've never received
[2:26:27] it into a soft heart but today God is
[2:26:30] saying he was saying then in in the book
[2:26:32] of Acts I want to send the Holy Spirit
[2:26:35] among you fill you with the Holy Ghost
[2:26:38] soften up your heart I want to take the
[2:26:41] Stony heart from you and I want to give
[2:26:43] you a heart of Flesh not because I'm
[2:26:45] changing my mind about my word
[2:26:48] but because I want you to receive my
[2:26:51] word in in in the right way in the right
[2:26:54] perspective and not try to beat people
[2:26:58] with regulations
[2:27:00] who have never had a new birth
[2:27:04] see I'll never have to talk to you about
[2:27:06] your skirt
[2:27:07] when you've truly had a new birth
[2:27:10] you'll know it needs to be big enough
[2:27:12] for you to get in it
[2:27:18] you can't make people who have not ever
[2:27:20] had a true New Birth
[2:27:22] you can't make them understand holiness
[2:27:26] but once they have a true New Birth
[2:27:30] somebody said well how do we know
[2:27:32] because everything changes when you're
[2:27:33] truly born again
[2:27:35] you look for reasons to get together
[2:27:36] with God's people not get away from them
[2:27:42] so John the Baptist had this kind of an
[2:27:45] anointing on him he stirred up
[2:27:48] he believed the word you'll never make
[2:27:49] him a compromiser he he believed the
[2:27:51] word so much that he prophesied and
[2:27:53] caused his child had to be chopped off
[2:27:56] he said it is not lawful for thee to
[2:27:59] have thy brother Philip's wife
[2:28:01] and they chopped off his head because of
[2:28:04] it but he represented the hearts of the
[2:28:08] fathers being turned to the apostolic or
[2:28:11] Pentecostal fathers God was saying I'm
[2:28:14] updating myself in the land
[2:28:18] then after that the church Ages come I'm
[2:28:20] hurrying
[2:28:21] after that the church Ages come and the
[2:28:24] truth is almost completely lost
[2:28:28] tyrants raise up and neroes come
[2:28:33] Constantine's common
[2:28:38] the truth is almost annihilated
[2:28:45] God begins After the Dark Ages he starts
[2:28:49] putting it back
[2:28:50] and he raises up a man named Martin
[2:28:52] Luther who didn't have it all right
[2:28:56] but he had a revelation that the just
[2:28:58] doesn't live by confessions and paying
[2:29:01] alms and uh
[2:29:04] you know climbing up the steps on with
[2:29:06] bloody knees and praying Hail Mary beads
[2:29:09] and kissing the feet of a crucifix
[2:29:13] that's how far that's how far the truth
[2:29:15] had drained from the people
[2:29:18] the majority of Christians
[2:29:22] in that period worship the church
[2:29:25] instead of God
[2:29:28] indulgences that's the word I was
[2:29:30] looking for
[2:29:31] they believed in indulgences that they
[2:29:34] believed in purgatory and they believed
[2:29:37] that you could die and go to Purgatory
[2:29:39] but a loved one could come and light a
[2:29:41] candle and pay an Indulgence to the
[2:29:44] priest and he could pray a prayer that
[2:29:47] would spring your soul from purgatory
[2:29:48] and cause you to go to heaven that was
[2:29:50] the doctrine of the day you say I didn't
[2:29:52] know it better than that I don't know if
[2:29:53] you would have or not
[2:29:55] because that was the Church of the day
[2:29:58] so no wonder Martin Luther caused a
[2:30:00] stink when he nailed his thesis to the
[2:30:03] wall and said hey we got to get out of
[2:30:04] this mess this is taking us farther away
[2:30:07] from God and then it took a man like
[2:30:09] John Wesley who came along and said it's
[2:30:12] not enough to just be justified by faith
[2:30:14] the scripture said we have to be
[2:30:16] Sanctified by the washing of the water
[2:30:18] of the word and we've got to put away
[2:30:20] worldliness
[2:30:22] and we've got to call men to be men and
[2:30:24] women to be women we've got to deal with
[2:30:26] the effeminate Spirit that's trying to
[2:30:28] take a hold of the church
[2:30:31] now let's let me just get on this a
[2:30:33] minute
[2:30:36] do you realize that we are reaping a
[2:30:38] harvest
[2:30:40] that the church sowed
[2:30:44] did you know there was once a time
[2:30:47] that it was preached for all Christian
[2:30:49] ladies
[2:30:51] Baptist Methodist
[2:30:54] Full Gospel whatever they were
[2:30:56] that women wear skirts
[2:31:00] come on you don't tell me
[2:31:03] I've been studying church history a long
[2:31:05] time
[2:31:06] you you you while the Baptist women had
[2:31:09] long hair
[2:31:11] they followed teachings like John rice
[2:31:17] who wrote that book
[2:31:20] bobbed hair bossy women and women
[2:31:22] preachers
[2:31:25] Southern Baptist
[2:31:27] famous book it'll shake you up
[2:31:30] I've read it multiple times
[2:31:33] I may have got it out of order when I
[2:31:34] read the title there was once a time
[2:31:37] when almost all the denominations
[2:31:38] understood the importance of
[2:31:40] differentiating between the genders
[2:31:44] just remember that when somebody digs up
[2:31:47] your bones one day
[2:31:49] they're not going to be able to figure
[2:31:51] out by your casket how you identified
[2:31:55] they're only going to be able to to
[2:31:57] determine by your remains
[2:32:00] because there are not a dozen genders
[2:32:04] [Music]
[2:32:05] and God didn't make anybody to be a
[2:32:07] furry
[2:32:13] because there's people who identify as
[2:32:15] furries
[2:32:17] and dress up in cat costumes and dog
[2:32:20] costumes and and want to go to school
[2:32:22] and distract our kids
[2:32:27] do you know we wouldn't be ripping this
[2:32:29] mess
[2:32:30] we wouldn't be trying to figure out 15
[2:32:32] different genders if the church would
[2:32:35] have just stood its ground
[2:32:37] Ed oh you don't have to say Amen
[2:32:41] if somebody would have just stayed with
[2:32:43] the word you let a woman dress like a
[2:32:46] woman you let a man dress like a man you
[2:32:48] let a woman have long hair you let a man
[2:32:50] keep his hair short
[2:32:52] that's not
[2:32:54] even self teach you the
[2:32:55] SE that's what the Bible's saying and
[2:32:58] when preachers preach that the
[2:32:59] Assemblies of God preach that
[2:33:05] how do you know because my grandmother
[2:33:06] was ordained with the assignments of God
[2:33:08] in 1950. and that's how they believed
[2:33:13] I asked the dearest friend of my
[2:33:15] grandmother a woman another woman
[2:33:16] preacher
[2:33:19] she wanted us to go to the State uh
[2:33:24] District Council
[2:33:26] of the Assemblies of God this was many
[2:33:28] many years ago
[2:33:29] she wanted us to go with her and I said
[2:33:31] I don't really have any desire to go
[2:33:33] to be honest with you
[2:33:36] I said the truth of the matter is you
[2:33:38] and my grandmother will be the only
[2:33:39] women in there dressed like Christian
[2:33:41] women
[2:33:42] and I don't understand why you still
[2:33:45] have license this was before I heard the
[2:33:48] message I don't understand why you would
[2:33:50] still carry license with a denomination
[2:33:53] that's so far away from what they used
[2:33:54] to preach and believe they're corrupt
[2:33:56] now
[2:33:57] and she said well Steve I'll tell you
[2:33:59] she said
[2:34:00] I didn't change
[2:34:03] she said they changed and every time
[2:34:06] they look at me
[2:34:09] they're going to have to remember what
[2:34:11] they were before they sold their soul
[2:34:14] to fill up their pews
[2:34:20] that's hard I'm not trying to pick on
[2:34:22] protect I'm just telling you history
[2:34:25] I've told you before I've got I've got
[2:34:28] uh membership cards that were still
[2:34:30] being used in the 80s
[2:34:34] in the assignments of God still saying
[2:34:36] we don't go to the movie theater we
[2:34:38] don't go mix bathing to be a member of
[2:34:41] our church
[2:34:44] we are not
[2:34:46] involved with secret societies like
[2:34:49] Shriners and Masons
[2:34:51] come on
[2:34:53] in fact it used to say we don't belong
[2:34:54] to labor unions
[2:34:59] because the Holiness I grew up with
[2:35:01] preached that that was the beginnings of
[2:35:05] the mark of the beast
[2:35:10] and had somebody have kept the word
[2:35:15] [Music]
[2:35:17] we wouldn't be in the mess we're in
[2:35:20] today
[2:35:21] where people choose their pronouns
[2:35:25] nobody ever told me I had a choice about
[2:35:27] my pronouns
[2:35:31] he him I thought that was
[2:35:33] some people now choose them
[2:35:37] I don't know if it's a confession of
[2:35:39] multiple personality disorder a
[2:35:42] confession of being demonized
[2:35:45] I don't know what they're confessing to
[2:35:47] say that we're they and and we I don't
[2:35:50] want to be referred to as he somebody
[2:35:52] said call me we
[2:35:56] isn't that awkward
[2:35:58] come on wee-wee let's go to town
[2:36:01] isn't that awkward
[2:36:06] there was a time oh he's hot today
[2:36:14] ah we gotta close
[2:36:17] it's 1 30. some of you haven't smile the
[2:36:19] whole time
[2:36:20] it's a truth
[2:36:22] we gotta stand
[2:36:26] we're not out condemning other people
[2:36:28] but when we get in here we better preach
[2:36:31] the whole book and live the whole book
[2:36:39] you don't give a former alcoholic a
[2:36:41] glass of wine and tell him to unwind
[2:36:50] that's what the church says now well
[2:36:53] even even Christians they say Sip and
[2:36:55] Saints even Christians can can in the
[2:36:58] cool of the day
[2:36:59] you'd be surprised how many people on my
[2:37:02] Facebook from from from my travels
[2:37:04] will show themselves uh at the end of
[2:37:07] the day with a glass of wine I'm
[2:37:09] unwinding
[2:37:12] I say I have said I've inboxed a couple
[2:37:14] of them said somebody needs to come and
[2:37:16] wind you up
[2:37:17] because you've gotten too far away from
[2:37:19] your Christian testimony
[2:37:23] instead of unwinding they need to get
[2:37:25] you pull you in a little bit closer
[2:37:27] because you don't do things like that
[2:37:29] especially for people that have already
[2:37:30] struggled in those areas you let that
[2:37:34] little bit open up a door
[2:37:35] somebody said what about I hear you
[2:37:37] serve real wine and communion I've never
[2:37:39] known I've never known in my entire life
[2:37:42] of somebody going back to being an
[2:37:44] alcoholic because they took a sip of
[2:37:46] communion wine
[2:37:48] because of the purpose it is Sanctified
[2:37:50] and intended for
[2:37:52] but I'll tell you I believe it's not for
[2:37:54] Christians to participate in because
[2:37:56] it'll take you right back to the places
[2:37:57] where you used to be
[2:38:00] hello
[2:38:02] [Music]
[2:38:06] well I'll just take a little drag of
[2:38:08] yours
[2:38:11] then it's all right it's not really mine
[2:38:16] so much compromise
[2:38:18] yeah
[2:38:19] let me get you this one are y'all
[2:38:22] helping me
[2:38:23] let me see how quiet it'll get now I'm
[2:38:25] too tired to come to church on Tuesday
[2:38:27] night I've been working all day
[2:38:30] what about the rest of these folks
[2:38:32] I won't even say me
[2:38:35] because I realize there are still people
[2:38:36] that think that pastors only only work
[2:38:39] Tuesday night and Sunday noon
[2:38:44] but what about the rest of the people
[2:38:47] my baby's got a snotty nose don't you
[2:38:50] don't think ours ever had a snotty nose
[2:38:53] you don't think you don't think that
[2:38:54] these some of these sisters here that
[2:38:56] raise their children you don't think
[2:38:57] they ever got worn out and tired
[2:38:59] you don't think they ever went through
[2:39:01] something
[2:39:03] I'm going through something so I ain't
[2:39:04] going to make it tonight
[2:39:07] if we only come to church when we were
[2:39:09] going not
[2:39:11] not going through something
[2:39:14] we'd never get together
[2:39:16] see you next millennium
[2:39:22] you got to put your foot down sometime
[2:39:25] you gotta say not because I feel like it
[2:39:29] but because I know what the book says
[2:39:32] [Applause]
[2:39:35] we ought not to have to go back and
[2:39:38] teach ABCs
[2:39:39] [Applause]
[2:39:42] but we do
[2:39:46] then the second part of that I didn't
[2:39:48] forget
[2:39:50] the first part he shall turn the heart
[2:39:52] of the fathers to the children and the
[2:39:54] Heart of the children
[2:39:57] to their fathers denominationally we
[2:39:59] read that and we say oh that is a a real
[2:40:02] a reunion between fathers and children
[2:40:04] I've heard it preach away
[2:40:06] nobody recognizes the karma
[2:40:10] nobody recognizes that it's preaching
[2:40:12] two different comings you really believe
[2:40:14] that brother Shelley I do
[2:40:17] I do and let me tell you what Jesus said
[2:40:19] about it you with me you're ready to go
[2:40:22] oh in the word or to lunch
[2:40:26] I didn't say which are you ready to go
[2:40:31] I gotta say
[2:40:33] I can tell I'm funny when when I look I
[2:40:36] always look to Josh to see if he smiles
[2:40:39] if I pass the Josh test I Look to David
[2:40:43] I have to be honest David is the harder
[2:40:45] of the two
[2:40:47] he don't smile enough I've told him
[2:40:49] Matthew said he said I'm listening yeah
[2:40:53] Matthew I'm just picking
[2:40:56] what a week I've had
[2:40:58] I got to go to the hospital Monday and
[2:41:01] meet that sweet little beautiful baby
[2:41:03] girl
[2:41:04] and love love her
[2:41:07] I got to go Wednesday and meet those two
[2:41:10] absolutely amazing
[2:41:12] beautiful little girls that Michael and
[2:41:15] crystalline have had
[2:41:17] they let me go
[2:41:19] anybody know
[2:41:21] how long three minutes is
[2:41:24] that's a long time to wash your hands
[2:41:29] three minutes you think that is a short
[2:41:32] time uh-uh you ain't got but two hands
[2:41:36] I can wash them in 10 seconds
[2:41:39] they put the timer on
[2:41:43] they give you a special bar of soap to
[2:41:45] scrub they give you something to clean
[2:41:47] your fingernails I said oh I wish they
[2:41:48] had to clean mine before I got here
[2:41:51] I could have just cleaned them here and
[2:41:53] took up more of my three minutes so I
[2:41:55] just pretended that I was because there
[2:41:57] was nothing under there
[2:42:00] make you go all the way up to your
[2:42:01] elbows and put your mask on they didn't
[2:42:04] make me put on a a
[2:42:07] head thing
[2:42:09] and we go in there and
[2:42:12] I get to hold this the I get the whole
[2:42:14] Adelaide out in the
[2:42:16] in the waiting room and and she's so
[2:42:19] tiny and so beautiful and
[2:42:22] and it's just hard to imagine something
[2:42:25] that little is alive and thriving
[2:42:28] you look you look at her and you think
[2:42:30] this looks like a doll
[2:42:32] she hardly looks real
[2:42:34] and then you go back and you touch that
[2:42:36] little Lydia
[2:42:37] and she's so tiny
[2:42:40] but now as of yesterday she is up to
[2:42:43] three pounds two ounces isn't that
[2:42:47] wonderful
[2:42:48] that's wonderful
[2:42:54] I look like an elephant in that picture
[2:42:59] I'm big anyway but holding that little
[2:43:01] thing on my lap
[2:43:03] what a wonderful week
[2:43:05] God is a god of Miracles
[2:43:08] now I want you to go to Matthew 17 and
[2:43:11] we'll close
[2:43:13] I'm on page two
[2:43:16] verse 9 and as they came down from the
[2:43:19] mountain Jesus charged them saying tell
[2:43:22] the vision to no man
[2:43:26] until the son of man be risen again from
[2:43:29] the dead
[2:43:37] I couldn't make a joke but I won't
[2:43:40] and his disciple
[2:43:49] must first come
[2:43:51] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[2:43:54] Elias truly shall first come and restore
[2:44:01] all things stop there
[2:44:06] they're asking Jesus
[2:44:10] why do the Pharisees say
[2:44:14] that Elijah must come first
[2:44:18] before these things
[2:44:21] are fulfilled
[2:44:29] they have just come down from the
[2:44:32] Transfiguration
[2:44:36] this is the first question they start
[2:44:38] asking
[2:44:40] he's probably still glowing
[2:44:45] and their question is why why was it
[2:44:47] their question
[2:44:49] because they just seen him
[2:44:53] he appeared there
[2:44:55] with our Lord
[2:44:59] so they said why then and Jesus said
[2:45:03] it's right
[2:45:06] Elijah must first come
[2:45:10] and restore all things stop
[2:45:16] you can read everything about the
[2:45:19] ministry of John the Baptist
[2:45:22] if you put it all together it wouldn't
[2:45:25] take up a whole page
[2:45:29] what are the all things
[2:45:33] that John the Baptist who had the spirit
[2:45:36] and power of Elijah on him what are the
[2:45:39] all things that He restored
[2:45:46] did he restore any truth
[2:45:49] that had been lost
[2:45:52] not that we know of
[2:45:55] there is no mention of John the Baptist
[2:45:58] doing the work of a restorer
[2:46:01] except
[2:46:02] that we know by Malachi's prophecy there
[2:46:06] would be one to come who would turn the
[2:46:08] hearts of the fathers to the children
[2:46:10] and we can say John the Baptist had a
[2:46:12] part in doing that but where is the
[2:46:15] restoration of all things
[2:46:20] John the Baptist didn't fulfill all of
[2:46:22] Malachi's prophecy
[2:46:25] he didn't
[2:46:27] now let's look at read on just a moment
[2:46:30] but I say unto you
[2:46:35] that Elijah Elias is come already
[2:46:40] now he just said he is to come go back
[2:46:43] I'm sorry charity I'm not trying to be
[2:46:46] bossy
[2:46:47] he just said he must first come and
[2:46:51] restore all things
[2:46:52] now what does that sound like to you
[2:46:54] he's pointing in the future
[2:46:56] he shall come
[2:46:58] didn't say he had come then he said he
[2:47:01] shall come first come and restore all
[2:47:04] things and then what does he say
[2:47:07] but I say unto you that Elijah is come
[2:47:10] already
[2:47:12] and they knew him not but have done unto
[2:47:15] him whatsoever they wished they listed
[2:47:20] likewise shall also the son of man
[2:47:24] suffer of them
[2:47:28] then the disciples understood that he
[2:47:33] spoke unto them
[2:47:35] of John the Baptist when
[2:47:39] when he said I tell you indeed he has
[2:47:41] already come
[2:47:43] he was not speaking about John the
[2:47:45] Baptist when he said he must first come
[2:47:47] and restore all things
[2:47:51] when he said he must first come and
[2:47:54] restore all things he is speaking about
[2:47:57] the Elijah spirit that will forerun the
[2:48:00] second coming
[2:48:03] when he said I tell you he has already
[2:48:05] come
[2:48:06] and they knew him not and did to him
[2:48:09] what they wanted to do what did they
[2:48:10] want to do chopped off his head
[2:48:13] he was then referring to John the
[2:48:15] Baptist
[2:48:17] John the Baptist came to turn the hearts
[2:48:19] of the fathers to the children and God
[2:48:21] had to have another vessel in the last
[2:48:23] days
[2:48:25] another prophet in the last days let me
[2:48:27] ask you was John the Baptist a prophet
[2:48:29] he was
[2:48:31] did he come in the spirit and power of
[2:48:33] Elijah he did was he Elijah
[2:48:39] did he restore all things
[2:48:44] he did not
[2:48:47] did he forerun the first coming of Jesus
[2:48:50] Christ he did
[2:48:53] did he turn the hearts of the old
[2:48:56] I don't know what to say I say
[2:48:58] patriarchal so that you'll think of
[2:49:00] Abraham and and and and and and and and
[2:49:02] Isaac and Jacob and and the Hebrew
[2:49:06] men Through the Ages did he try to pull
[2:49:09] those Pharisees into what God was doing
[2:49:12] today he did
[2:49:14] whoo
[2:49:16] he said you Generation of Vipers you
[2:49:20] better he's not pointing at the Harlot
[2:49:23] he was pointing at the preacher
[2:49:26] he was pointing at the religious leaders
[2:49:29] of the day
[2:49:31] you were you're just a den of devils
[2:49:34] thieves you you're just you've got to
[2:49:36] get right with God
[2:49:38] so his ministry was to pull those who
[2:49:41] were clinging to the older Covenant and
[2:49:43] and and what they had added to it and
[2:49:46] how difficult they had made it
[2:49:49] they wanted to make sure they were
[2:49:51] always needed
[2:49:53] so they made it so hard that nobody
[2:49:56] could feel like they had done any good
[2:50:06] uh someone dies in the camp
[2:50:09] and the whole Camp becomes unclean
[2:50:11] because there's so many people crammed
[2:50:14] into one little spot to hear Jesus how
[2:50:16] many of you know the law wasn't saying
[2:50:17] that
[2:50:20] there was a separation That was supposed
[2:50:22] to take place among the priesthood not
[2:50:25] to be contaminated or come in contact
[2:50:27] with dead bodies meaning touch them or
[2:50:30] be that close to them let's go to the
[2:50:33] scene of the chosen
[2:50:35] when the little woman with the issue of
[2:50:37] blood she didn't touch his body
[2:50:40] he touched the Hem of His Garment
[2:50:43] she touched his seat
[2:50:45] didn't she and there were the priest you
[2:50:48] see him
[2:50:51] he looked like some of those people
[2:50:52] yesterday walking around grown men after
[2:50:55] all these years parading around in
[2:50:57] dresses
[2:51:00] coronating the king
[2:51:07] oh I love it it's beautiful it's
[2:51:10] beautiful to see
[2:51:11] but it just Smacks
[2:51:14] it just stings
[2:51:16] I thought here is a king who says he's
[2:51:18] going to narrow down and shrink the
[2:51:21] royal family and their duties and all
[2:51:23] the money that's spent on them he didn't
[2:51:25] he didn't let them spare any expense for
[2:51:27] his coronation did he
[2:51:31] the golden Chariot he wrote in has
[2:51:33] anybody ever ever seen it in person I've
[2:51:35] seen that golden Chariot my wife and I
[2:51:38] we went to the Royal Muse in London and
[2:51:40] we saw all the Chariots and the horses
[2:51:42] that were being used in that time it was
[2:51:44] an incredible thing to see but that
[2:51:46] Chariot could feed all the homeless in
[2:51:48] the UK
[2:51:52] unbelievable value
[2:51:55] I'm not I'm not saying anything about
[2:51:57] it's a beautiful pageantry no doubt
[2:51:59] about it but but there's something about
[2:52:01] the you know the Archbishop and the
[2:52:05] and the anointing behind the curtain in
[2:52:07] the stone of scone and
[2:52:10] all these things
[2:52:13] that just smack of religion and
[2:52:17] here is a divorced man
[2:52:19] marrying a divorced woman
[2:52:22] and as of yesterday he became the the
[2:52:25] the the appointee of God
[2:52:29] to rule a nation
[2:52:31] and speaks with the authority you do
[2:52:33] understand that they believe that he
[2:52:35] speaks like the pope with the authority
[2:52:37] of God for the nation
[2:52:42] it's a serious serious thought and his
[2:52:45] mother fought against it her whole life
[2:52:48] because she did not believe that that he
[2:52:51] was qualified
[2:52:52] because of that sin
[2:52:55] to be the the vicar of the Church of
[2:52:58] England the highest Authority in the
[2:53:00] Church of England it's interesting but I
[2:53:03] can see it here are the Pharisees
[2:53:07] they needed a John the Baptist to stir
[2:53:09] things up they needed somebody to look
[2:53:12] him in the face and say you become so
[2:53:14] religious you stink
[2:53:16] there's no sincerity in your heart
[2:53:18] you're more concerned about him going
[2:53:21] into the river and walk then you are the
[2:53:23] miracle that and wash then the miracle
[2:53:26] that has just taken place a woman
[2:53:27] tormented with an issue of blood her
[2:53:29] whole life and now she's been healed and
[2:53:31] instead of rejoicing and praising God
[2:53:33] for the miracle you want to make sure he
[2:53:36] gets down didn't Jesus turn it upside
[2:53:38] down in the movie anyway I hope that
[2:53:41] really happened
[2:53:43] I hope he really did go down there and
[2:53:45] splash like a kid if anybody ever
[2:53:48] deserved to do it he did
[2:53:50] but John the Baptist fulfilled his part
[2:53:53] of the Malachi 4 Commission
[2:53:57] but it was not time for all things to be
[2:54:00] restored 2 000 years ago
[2:54:05] it was only in our day
[2:54:08] when we come all the way to the last
[2:54:10] Church age laodicea
[2:54:12] when all things had to be restored
[2:54:18] I'm sorry to tell you that when it came
[2:54:22] time to do such God didn't choose a
[2:54:25] graduate
[2:54:27] of Asbury Theological Seminary
[2:54:31] he didn't choose a graduate of uh of the
[2:54:35] Baptist Dallas Theological Seminary
[2:54:40] he chose someone with barely an
[2:54:43] elementary school education who wouldn't
[2:54:46] mix the word of the Lord with opinion
[2:54:51] [Applause]
[2:54:52] who wouldn't entertain
[2:54:55] who didn't believe in in in selling Bean
[2:54:59] dinners to pay the pastor when God had
[2:55:02] already made a way for him to survive
[2:55:04] come on now
[2:55:06] God knew all things had to be restored
[2:55:08] and he also knew that now now the
[2:55:11] children
[2:55:14] have to have their hearts turned back to
[2:55:17] the fathers which are no longer the Old
[2:55:20] Testament
[2:55:21] patriarchal fathers our fathers were
[2:55:24] those on the day of Pentecost
[2:55:27] so that that was clinging to the old
[2:55:30] they had to embrace the new that God did
[2:55:32] on the day of Pentecost and then the
[2:55:34] church World goes down and the truth
[2:55:36] goes down and now it's being restored
[2:55:38] and as I told you a moment ago Luther
[2:55:39] came and Wesley came and then God sent a
[2:55:42] message
[2:55:43] by sending a man
[2:55:47] with the spirit and power of Elijah who
[2:55:49] would fulfill the second part
[2:55:51] of the Elijah commission what John the
[2:55:54] Baptist could not fulfill or did not
[2:55:56] fulfill God had someone chosen to
[2:55:58] fulfill that
[2:56:00] aren't you adding to the Bible no I'm
[2:56:02] trying to see the Bible fulfilled in my
[2:56:04] day
[2:56:05] I'm telling you the word still lives
[2:56:07] today
[2:56:09] how do you know this is it because it
[2:56:11] has restored all things
[2:56:16] we now know the godhead by the word not
[2:56:20] by Brother random
[2:56:21] he just pointed us to the word and once
[2:56:25] you take a look at the word you'll never
[2:56:27] swallow three persons again
[2:56:30] we now have the right baptism which is
[2:56:33] not to be in the name of titles it's to
[2:56:36] be in the name
[2:56:39] we now know that Sinners are not given
[2:56:42] eternal life
[2:56:44] to live for eternity and Punishment
[2:56:49] the only ones who have eternal life are
[2:56:51] those who are born again
[2:56:53] by the blood of the Lamb
[2:56:56] the Bible said the soul that Sinners
[2:56:58] shall surely die and one day they will
[2:57:02] but no soul with eternal life
[2:57:05] we now know that we now know the Rapture
[2:57:08] is more than than a blinking of an eye
[2:57:10] it's a process it's the Lord coming
[2:57:12] first in a message it's a word coming
[2:57:15] first it's a shout going forth first we
[2:57:18] now recognize that why because all
[2:57:20] things have been restored
[2:57:25] we now know that communion is not soda
[2:57:27] crackers
[2:57:28] and grape juice
[2:57:32] we now know that it's to be unleavened
[2:57:34] bread
[2:57:36] and it's to mean more than just grabbing
[2:57:38] a bottle of grape juice on the way to
[2:57:39] church
[2:57:40] it's to be taken with real wine because
[2:57:42] it represents the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:57:44] grape juice spoils
[2:57:47] wine rarely spoils when it's put up
[2:57:49] properly in fact it gets sweeter and
[2:57:51] more valuable the older it gets just
[2:57:53] like the blood it's sweeter sweeter oh
[2:57:55] Hallelujah the blood hadn't lost its
[2:57:57] power somebody say man the blood hasn't
[2:58:00] lost its power can't smile
[2:58:03] we now know that
[2:58:05] we now know you don't get baptized three
[2:58:08] times in the name of the father in the
[2:58:09] name of the Son and the Holy Ghost like
[2:58:11] some denominations do
[2:58:12] we now know that there was no one in the
[2:58:14] Bible not one single solitary scripture
[2:58:17] in the Bible anywhere that ever tells us
[2:58:19] that anybody was ever taken under the
[2:58:21] water using those titles father son Holy
[2:58:24] Ghost nowhere in the Bible
[2:58:27] every baptism recorded in the scripture
[2:58:29] was either in the name of Jesus or in
[2:58:32] the name of Jesus Christ none of them
[2:58:36] using Father Son and Holy Ghost
[2:58:38] so either they disobeyed the word of the
[2:58:40] Lord or they had a revelation of what
[2:58:42] the Lord was trying to teach them
[2:58:44] how do we know that because all things
[2:58:45] have been restored
[2:58:47] what John the Baptist didn't finish God
[2:58:49] sent brother Branham in his day you can
[2:58:52] believe it or not
[2:58:53] I'm not here to sell you anything but
[2:58:56] I'm telling you why it matters
[2:58:58] I'm telling you why I'm going to mention
[2:59:00] his name I'm telling you why I'm going
[2:59:02] to quote him when I want to quote him
[2:59:03] I'm going to tell you that if I want to
[2:59:05] tell a story about his life I'm going to
[2:59:07] do it and I recognize that he's just a
[2:59:10] man that God chose to use he is not
[2:59:12] invaluable
[2:59:14] his words are not the absolute
[2:59:17] amen
[2:59:21] one time he said he was commissioned in
[2:59:23] 46 and the other time he said he was
[2:59:25] commissioned in 37.
[2:59:31] and I say it doesn't matter what year
[2:59:37] it doesn't matter to me whether he was
[2:59:39] born April 6 of 1909 or April 9th of
[2:59:41] 1906.
[2:59:46] I'm not looking at that
[2:59:48] it doesn't matter to me whether he was
[2:59:49] in the in the in the desert out there on
[2:59:52] Sunset a mountain when the when the
[2:59:55] Angels Came Down When the cloud let's
[2:59:57] just say when the cloud was taken
[2:59:58] doesn't matter to me if he was there
[2:59:59] that day or not
[3:00:02] all these things that matter to so many
[3:00:04] people doesn't really matter after all
[3:00:06] because we're not we're not following an
[3:00:08] info an infallible man we're following a
[3:00:11] man just like John the Baptist who was a
[3:00:14] human being
[3:00:16] but that spirit and power of Elijah fell
[3:00:18] on him and he was a prophet then I'm
[3:00:20] telling you come on now
[3:00:22] and He restored all things
[3:00:24] anybody with me
[3:00:26] all right I'm not quite done but I'm
[3:00:28] almost done all you people I don't know
[3:00:30] if you're still amen and or not let me
[3:00:32] see yeah some of you are
[3:00:34] thank God for you
[3:00:37] in the message of trial
[3:00:41] we got a lot to cover but we'll have to
[3:00:44] do it next time
[3:00:45] paragraph 145.
[3:00:47] and he spoke down on the river
[3:00:51] he said as John the Baptist was sent
[3:00:53] forth to proclaim the coming of Christ
[3:00:56] at the end of his ministry Jesus came
[3:01:00] and as John was sent so will your
[3:01:04] ministry for run the second coming of
[3:01:08] Christ
[3:01:09] sometimes he said your ministry
[3:01:12] sometimes he said your message sometimes
[3:01:16] brother Branham said he said you
[3:01:21] it doesn't matter to me
[3:01:24] whether it was your ministry
[3:01:26] your message
[3:01:29] a message
[3:01:30] or you
[3:01:32] doesn't matter to me
[3:01:33] because I've seen all things restored
[3:01:36] you understand when you see all things
[3:01:39] restored you become a believer
[3:01:41] and it's easier for you to believe than
[3:01:43] to disbelieve I've seen all things
[3:01:45] restored
[3:01:46] he goes on
[3:01:49] we're waiting for his coming
[3:01:52] he is vindicating himself showing
[3:01:57] now
[3:01:58] this is what I think is important to
[3:02:00] leave you with
[3:02:02] in questions and answers on the seals
[3:02:04] 1963.
[3:02:07] paragraph 252.
[3:02:09] and finally one day he said
[3:02:12] behold there he is who's he talking
[3:02:14] about
[3:02:14] tell me
[3:02:16] John the Baptist
[3:02:19] John the Baptist is pointing at the lamb
[3:02:21] Jesus
[3:02:23] he said and finally one day he said
[3:02:25] behold there he is
[3:02:27] there is the Lamb of God that takes away
[3:02:29] the sin of the world
[3:02:31] he said and my time is up now
[3:02:34] this is John the Baptist
[3:02:36] he's quoting
[3:02:39] I've introduced you to him
[3:02:42] I must decrease now
[3:02:44] I must go off the scene
[3:02:46] he'll take over from here
[3:02:49] the Millennium will be on right away see
[3:02:53] and the time at hand then when he come
[3:02:57] when
[3:02:58] now is he talking about John the Baptist
[3:03:00] all the way through no
[3:03:03] put it back up
[3:03:06] he's telling you
[3:03:08] as John the Baptist said I must back
[3:03:12] further
[3:03:14] I must decrease
[3:03:18] he must increase
[3:03:21] so you're seeing something here you're
[3:03:24] seeing the other end of that Elijah
[3:03:26] spirit
[3:03:28] you're seeing that he came the first
[3:03:31] time to introduce Jesus Christ in his
[3:03:33] first coming and he came the second time
[3:03:36] the spirit and power of John the Baptist
[3:03:38] a spirit of Elijah excuse me the spirit
[3:03:41] and power of of Elijah that was on John
[3:03:43] the Baptist came the first time to
[3:03:45] introduce Jesus Christ the first time he
[3:03:47] came in the ministry of William Branham
[3:03:51] to introduce the second coming of Christ
[3:03:54] and here brother Branham says
[3:03:57] I've introduced you to him
[3:04:00] I must decrease now
[3:04:02] I must go off the scene
[3:04:05] let's go on he'll take over from here
[3:04:11] now where are we
[3:04:14] we're faced with a musicians are coming
[3:04:18] we're faced with quite a dilemma in our
[3:04:20] day
[3:04:24] we really are challenged are you with me
[3:04:26] you've done pretty good thank you thank
[3:04:28] you thank you
[3:04:32] we're faced with quite a dilemma in our
[3:04:34] day
[3:04:36] because here we have heard that John the
[3:04:38] Baptist
[3:04:39] wanted to decrease so that Jesus could
[3:04:42] increase
[3:04:43] and here we have heard that brother
[3:04:45] Branham desired
[3:04:48] to decrease so that Jesus could increase
[3:04:53] and then you and I are faced with the
[3:04:55] Dilemma how do we keep the balance
[3:05:02] listen
[3:05:04] how do we mention him
[3:05:06] and quote him
[3:05:08] and recognize the ministry that he had
[3:05:12] without getting our eyes
[3:05:15] off of Jesus
[3:05:21] how many of you believe it's vitally
[3:05:23] important
[3:05:24] that we keep our eyes on Jesus Christ
[3:05:30] now if you make brother Branham
[3:05:32] infallible what does that mean what does
[3:05:34] infallibility mean
[3:05:36] without wrong
[3:05:39] without mistake
[3:05:41] if you make brother Branham infallible
[3:05:44] as one who never made a mistake you
[3:05:47] contradict the message
[3:05:51] he said I make thousands of mistakes
[3:05:53] every day which I believe was a mistake
[3:05:59] I don't believe he made a thought I
[3:06:01] believe he was exaggerating
[3:06:05] I don't believe he made a thousand
[3:06:06] mistakes I don't believe I make a
[3:06:08] thousand mistakes every day maybe a few
[3:06:11] hundred
[3:06:13] but I don't believe I make a thousand
[3:06:15] mistakes every day why do you think he
[3:06:16] was exaggerating so
[3:06:20] because he wanted to get the the point
[3:06:22] across to the people I'm your brother
[3:06:27] yes I'm not your savior
[3:06:29] I'm your brother
[3:06:32] you that are saying funny things about
[3:06:34] me
[3:06:36] he said if you're saying that Christ
[3:06:38] lives in me
[3:06:40] I pray you are correct
[3:06:43] but if you're saying that I am he
[3:06:46] you make me an antichrist
[3:06:49] how do we keep our balance
[3:06:52] when we see a Ministry so close to the
[3:06:55] ministry of Jesus Christ like the world
[3:06:57] has never seen
[3:06:59] one greater a minister greater than that
[3:07:01] of John the Baptist
[3:07:03] one that restored all things
[3:07:06] when we see a Ministry like that how do
[3:07:09] we make sure
[3:07:12] that we keep Jesus in the right position
[3:07:14] and we let brother Branham have his
[3:07:17] right position
[3:07:21] well for the one thing we don't hang his
[3:07:23] pictures up on the wall
[3:07:26] with Jesus on one side and brother
[3:07:28] Branham on the other and make them look
[3:07:30] to the people as though they're equal
[3:07:36] because Jesus was not a sinner
[3:07:40] saved by grace
[3:07:42] William Branham was
[3:07:47] he'll tell you about his birth
[3:07:49] there was no angel that came and
[3:07:52] overshadowed his mother he said I'm a
[3:07:54] product of Charles and Ella Branham
[3:07:58] they came together in a sexual Union
[3:08:02] I I had to be saved I he was a a pro you
[3:08:05] believe John the Baptist had to receive
[3:08:07] the truth and be washed sure he did you
[3:08:10] believe all the holy prophets and
[3:08:11] apostles you believe Peter had to be
[3:08:13] saved and baptized in the name of Jesus
[3:08:15] Christ and received the Holy Ghost sure
[3:08:19] do you believe Mary the mother of Jesus
[3:08:21] had to have the Holy Ghost
[3:08:23] she did
[3:08:24] you believe brother Brandon had to do
[3:08:26] the same
[3:08:29] so what do I say to the Congress I know
[3:08:31] it's a little tough in here
[3:08:33] we're closing
[3:08:35] what do I say to the I'm not condemning
[3:08:37] I know you churches decide to do that I
[3:08:39] decide not to and because I decide not
[3:08:42] to you say I'm not a message church here
[3:08:45] now I'm explaining to you why I don't
[3:08:49] I don't want you to come in here and see
[3:08:51] Hoffman's head of Christ
[3:08:53] and brother branham's picture here now
[3:08:55] when I first came around the message
[3:08:59] it was Hoffman's head
[3:09:02] and it was brother Branham
[3:09:04] in a studio pose
[3:09:09] as the years went by they took the
[3:09:12] studio pose down
[3:09:15] and they put the pillar of fire picture
[3:09:17] up
[3:09:18] and I've heard them say it's the same
[3:09:25] if you're looking at the pillar of fire
[3:09:27] over his head
[3:09:29] you could say that
[3:09:33] but if you're looking at the man William
[3:09:35] Branham
[3:09:37] he was not the same
[3:09:40] sinner saved by grace so how do we keep
[3:09:44] our balance
[3:09:46] when you stand up and say this message
[3:09:49] is my absolute
[3:09:54] you're not keeping a balance
[3:10:01] because which
[3:10:03] one example which
[3:10:06] May the 7th 1946
[3:10:10] or
[3:10:12] May the 7th 1937.
[3:10:15] which is the absolute
[3:10:18] I've asked questions like that of these
[3:10:20] learned men and they've said to me both
[3:10:23] and I don't mean to be disrespectful but
[3:10:25] I say that's good good bologna sandwich
[3:10:31] how do we keep our balance in the
[3:10:33] scripture
[3:10:34] is it when brother Branham said there
[3:10:36] was an eternal hell or when he said
[3:10:38] there wasn't
[3:10:43] there are many many things that we can
[3:10:45] do
[3:10:47] to make sure
[3:10:49] that we keep
[3:10:52] our Focus
[3:10:55] not on the Forerunner
[3:10:59] I've introduced you to him now he's
[3:11:01] taking over
[3:11:04] let me give you the ultimate one right
[3:11:06] here it's not in a picture
[3:11:08] it's not in the songs we sing
[3:11:11] it's in a heart
[3:11:13] that makes a decision
[3:11:16] I'm going to take everything back to the
[3:11:22] word
[3:11:24] if the word is our Focus this is Christ
[3:11:29] this is Christ in written form
[3:11:31] oh yes
[3:11:33] if the word is our Focus if Jesus is our
[3:11:37] Focus then we take everything we hear
[3:11:40] on Sunday morning
[3:11:43] back to the word
[3:11:47] Sunday evening if we listen to a tape we
[3:11:50] take everything we hear
[3:11:52] back to the word
[3:11:54] so that we always have Jesus here
[3:11:57] we have brother Branham and and John the
[3:12:00] Baptist here is
[3:12:01] or runners
[3:12:03] and we have a five-fold Ministry
[3:12:06] come on
[3:12:07] the voice of many Waters
[3:12:10] it's vitally important as we begin to go
[3:12:13] through these end time events again and
[3:12:16] we begin to look at the seals and and at
[3:12:18] some point the Thunders it's vitally
[3:12:20] important that we let
[3:12:23] our Focus be on Jesus Christ
[3:12:28] because had there been no Christ had
[3:12:30] there been no blood had there been no
[3:12:32] Grace
[3:12:33] had there not been a savior you and I
[3:12:35] could be religious and we could know all
[3:12:37] the Mysteries
[3:12:38] and be lost
[3:12:40] it's Jesus I see let's stand
[3:12:48] oh praise the lord it's Jesus that I see
[3:12:57] the son of man
[3:13:01] revealed in you and me

[3:16:03] sung it let's go on unto Perfections
[3:16:08] though we are
[3:16:10] potentially
[3:16:12] till Christ is formed within us and all
[3:16:17] promises believe
[3:16:20] and this body is translated right into
[3:16:25] the heavenly

[3:18:36] where the people
[3:18:45] you you you you may not feel perfect
[3:18:50] you may not behave perfect
[3:18:54] but we're not looking in the natural
[3:18:57] I'm not looking through these glasses
[3:19:00] I'm looking through the blood of God
[3:19:03] hello
[3:19:04] now I want to I want to just interview
[3:19:06] the church just a minute brother Billy
[3:19:08] you think you're something back there
[3:19:10] don't you
[3:19:12] holding that new grandbaby
[3:19:15] what year did you come to New Hope
[3:19:18] 91 how many years ago was that you
[3:19:20] mathematicians
[3:19:22] 32 years ago
[3:19:25] all right
[3:19:28] what I preached today about brother
[3:19:30] branham's place
[3:19:31] with Jesus is there anything in that
[3:19:34] that is different than what you have
[3:19:36] heard me preach through the years does
[3:19:37] that seem to be where we have stood for
[3:19:39] those 30 years right
[3:19:42] I know it's on the spot
[3:19:45] brother Greeley what year did you come
[3:19:47] 96 did that seem to be pretty consistent
[3:19:51] today where I believe brother Brandon
[3:19:53] belongs in the right place with the
[3:19:55] great honor and great respect but not
[3:19:58] the absolute and he wanted us to see
[3:20:00] Jesus how many years was that Nathan 27
[3:20:04] years
[3:20:05] I tell you what I wonder how many hours
[3:20:07] you've listened to me preaching 27 years
[3:20:15] almost 5 000 hours you think that's all
[3:20:29] no wonder I'm wrinkled
[3:20:34] I'm tired
[3:20:36] if you would have breached 4 500 hours
[3:20:41] you'd be tired too Chad when did you
[3:20:44] come
[3:20:46] 90.
[3:20:47] you mean you was here before brother
[3:20:49] Billy
[3:20:51] 1990 that's been
[3:20:53] 33 years
[3:20:57] about right
[3:20:59] part of them times you was a youngin
[3:21:02] getting whoopings
[3:21:06] and then and a young adult getting
[3:21:08] whippings
[3:21:11] but is that pretty consistent what I've
[3:21:13] said today is this some new doctrine I'm
[3:21:15] preaching about brother Branham either
[3:21:17] way I mean does this feel new to you or
[3:21:19] something like I I'm saying it different
[3:21:21] than I believed it or does it seem about
[3:21:23] what we've stood for all these years
[3:21:25] thank you
[3:21:28] my wife has been married to me how 25 26
[3:21:33] years going on
[3:21:35] does that seem pretty consistent with
[3:21:37] what the balance is sister Beverly what
[3:21:39] year did you come
[3:21:41] 90.
[3:21:42] does that seem about right to you you
[3:21:44] were an adult with children grown
[3:21:46] children just about
[3:21:48] so you you heard a lot of preaching
[3:21:50] wonder how many years sister wonder how
[3:21:52] how much how many hours does sister
[3:21:54] Beverly listen to then
[3:22:03] yeah yeah if she was hearing them early
[3:22:06] years I preached four hours and then and
[3:22:09] then and have church for another four or
[3:22:10] so
[3:22:15] which we did then
[3:22:23] can I just say to you people if you
[3:22:25] don't make the Rapture it's not my fault
[3:22:29] I've done my part
[3:22:31] Lord I'm retiring
[3:22:36] sister Elita how many years have you
[3:22:38] been here
[3:22:41] 95 how many years is that
[3:22:44] 28 years seemed what I've preached today
[3:22:47] seemed to be the balance that we've
[3:22:49] always tried to keep with Jesus in the
[3:22:51] right spot and brother Branham in the
[3:22:52] right spot
[3:22:53] you know I love brother Branham I want
[3:22:55] you to know
[3:22:57] I'm so thankful for him
[3:22:59] I really am I I love it
[3:23:03] I've slept in his bed I laid my head on
[3:23:05] his pillow I covered up with his blanket
[3:23:09] I I love to walk where he walked I like
[3:23:12] to see what he saw
[3:23:14] I like to eat in the restaurants he ate
[3:23:17] in
[3:23:17] and I've ordered the same meal that he
[3:23:19] ordered because I love him
[3:23:24] but I know like you know
[3:23:26] it's Jesus
[3:23:29] we've we've been introduced to
[3:23:31] to the Lord Jesus Christ

[3:23:50] preached today that you were able to
[3:23:52] hear about brother Branham and Jesus in
[3:23:54] the right does that seem to be where
[3:23:56] we've tried to have it all along
[3:23:59] all right
[3:24:00] all right

[3:24:21] might be some I thought I wasn't putting
[3:24:23] enough
[3:24:24] and I just want you to know we're just
[3:24:25] trying to maintain the balance we've
[3:24:27] always maintained

[3:32:31] and renew our right spirit
[3:32:36] amazing
[3:32:42] in the Lord good
[3:32:45] I'm a little tired to try to minister to
[3:32:48] you in any other way today but God is
[3:32:50] good and faithful and true
[3:32:52] all we have to do is trust him and
[3:32:54] believe
[3:32:55] he'll bring us through whatever it is
[3:32:57] that we're facing be seated just a
[3:32:59] moment
[3:33:01] I thought we were getting out you are
[3:33:04] you really are
[3:33:06] I want to tell you something
[3:33:09] if you're not fully persuaded
[3:33:12] of the things that I have spoken of
[3:33:14] today you pray just pray just pray don't
[3:33:18] be critical
[3:33:20] don't be critical just pray you ask the
[3:33:23] Lord to reveal it to you and if he wants
[3:33:26] you to know something more than what you
[3:33:27] know he'll reveal it but don't be
[3:33:29] critical
[3:33:30] it's important that you're not critical
[3:33:33] and here's here is the point if God has
[3:33:36] sent a prophet
[3:33:39] to reject him
[3:33:42] a serious business
[3:33:45] somebody said well what about those that
[3:33:47] don't hear we're not talking to them
[3:33:50] God gave you an opportunity
[3:33:54] to hear
[3:33:55] what you do with what you have heard is
[3:33:59] between you and the Lord
[3:34:01] I know some of you are going through
[3:34:03] things in your life and that this is not
[3:34:05] the kind of a message that could perhaps
[3:34:07] speak to you in that moment but I've
[3:34:08] obeyed the Lord today I've done what he
[3:34:11] told me to do and then I have to trust
[3:34:13] that he will take care of you in your
[3:34:15] time of need don't let the enemy cause
[3:34:17] you to be critical and don't let the
[3:34:20] enemy exaggerate anything that has been
[3:34:22] spoken today you watch it carefully
[3:34:24] it'll be on the app if you would like to
[3:34:26] go back and hear it again and make sure
[3:34:28] you heard it right but it's important
[3:34:31] it's important that you that you know
[3:34:34] where we stand in these things because
[3:34:37] we're going to move on now we're going
[3:34:39] to move on to whatever the Lord is
[3:34:40] calling us to we want to study some
[3:34:43] things from the word and the message and
[3:34:45] we want to get it right and the only way
[3:34:47] to get the message right is to keep our
[3:34:49] balance in the scripture
[3:34:51] if you believe that say Amen why would
[3:34:53] God why would God want to reveal these
[3:34:56] things to us because we need to know how
[3:34:57] to navigate the future I'm not planning
[3:35:00] to live here that much longer
[3:35:02] I plan to take a trip don't you
[3:35:05] amen so I just want you to pray and be
[3:35:08] very considerate uh uh of of that that
[3:35:11] you that you don't let the enemy uh
[3:35:14] cause you to criticize what you don't
[3:35:15] understand you ask the Lord to show it
[3:35:18] to you and open it up to you and if it's
[3:35:20] for you he will
[3:35:22] he will
[3:35:23] and don't don't get upset and say I'm
[3:35:26] going to quit coming to church because I
[3:35:27] don't understand it you come to church
[3:35:29] where you belong to be
[3:35:32] you let God touch you you don't have to
[3:35:35] believe everything I believe to come to
[3:35:36] church here but I'm going to tell you
[3:35:39] what I believe the word said and you
[3:35:41] just you just hold it like Mary ponder
[3:35:44] it in your heart and see if it be for
[3:35:47] you and God's speaking to you amen
[3:35:51] it's a whole lot more likely that you
[3:35:53] will change than we
[3:35:58] it is
[3:36:00] I I think I've done made my mark now I
[3:36:03] don't see nothing to go back to
[3:36:05] I've been out there I've met all the
[3:36:08] leading Prophets
[3:36:10] of the Pentecostal charismatic world
[3:36:12] I've met them all
[3:36:15] I've been in there in their green rooms
[3:36:18] I've spoken with them I've met them all
[3:36:20] and believe me nothing I found in 10
[3:36:25] years of travel begins to compare with
[3:36:29] the integrity
[3:36:31] of the ministry of brother Branham
[3:36:33] none of it
[3:36:35] so if I were to be persuaded this was
[3:36:38] not the Fulfillment of the power and
[3:36:40] spirit of Elijah Verde somebody would
[3:36:43] have to get up mighty early in the
[3:36:45] morning to show me somebody that could
[3:36:47] do it it has been done
[3:36:50] and we are the beneficiaries sister
[3:36:53] Alfreda I left you out but not on
[3:36:55] purpose how many years have you been
[3:36:57] here
[3:37:02] here in 93 and on the hookup since 92
[3:37:06] and when did we meet the first time in
[3:37:08] in Michigan

[3:37:45] consistently have I introduced something
[3:37:47] new and out out of the way this morning
[3:37:49] as far as you know seems to be about the
[3:37:51] same
