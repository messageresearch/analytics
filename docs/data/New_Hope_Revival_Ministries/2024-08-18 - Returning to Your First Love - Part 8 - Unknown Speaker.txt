Lord you know in our in our personal lives sometimes times there is uh there seems to be uh deficit in our checkbook which nobody carries anymore um but some still have well most everybody still has an account and sometimes there seems to be a deficit and sometimes even in the ministry there seems to be a deficit but in God's checkbook there's never a deficit he is on time every time and so as

God hallelujah oh what a great love you have for us aren't we blessed to be loved to be loved by him amen you may be seated this morning it's wonderful to be in the house of the Lord we still have over a hundred people here this morning with so many out aren't we blessed it's not about people but it's about life it's about living it's about the Holy Ghost breathing life into the body of Believers he's doing that and the Millers will soon be here God willing from Missouri how long has it been that they've been fighting to get here a long time but you know the Lord knows exactly the right timing amen and uh behind the scenes God is working some things out for some other folks who will be making a transition here very shortly too and I'm not allowed to talk about that yet but God is good he's keeping his word he's keeping his promise and uh it's not about filling up a building it's not it's about th those being in their bone it's bone to bone yes sir there you go that's what it's about bone to bone every bone finding his bone yes amen we have so much to be thankful for I want to just thank you for giving uh a little love offering of benevolence to the Hendrick family we're going to be giving the check today to Sister Flo and she's going to pass it on uh to Sister Pam this week and you gave $2,100 and that is greatly appreciated by the family and I want you to give yourselves a [Applause] hand God is good we know that funerals cost a whole lot more than that um I I will very shortly have my mother's paid off so I know exactly how uh but when you're faced with it in the moment you just do what you have to do you give a credit card or you do whatever you have to do and we're beleving that God will multiply that abundantly to Sister Pam and to the family and and that it wouldn't be a too much of a burden for them in an hour like this God is never too late he is always right on time uh food gets throwed out because you take more than people can eat and flowers fade so quickly but a bill comes every month so if we can do something like that this was a great opportunity to do that and one more time sister Flo ask me again this week to thank you for your love for your prayers for your uh coming to the viewing for your coming to the funeral and for this offering for for Pam and and their expenses so we're just thankful that we could be a part of that uh tomorrow is Sister Kathy's birthday and then uh she travels on the 20th uh home for just a uh her old home for just a a short amount of time but let let's wish sister Kathy a happy birthday this week God bless [Applause] her it's a week of birthdays and I would encourage you when you're having all these children if you could just plan not to have them one day right after another because birthdays get costly like that when they all fall in the same time right half of ours were born the same week and so uh we have birthdays uh this week Tuesday this is very hard for me to say these words do not come easy I am straining to say that our baby girl Mariah Destiny is turning 18 that is just hard to comprehend uh could we say happy birthday to [Applause] Mariah and then our oldest that's on the 20th and then our oldest on Wednesday uh Benjamin is having a birthday uh our youngest and then our oldest so we want to wish Benjamin happy birthday 206 he'll be 26 it's incredible and since I'm 56 that means I was 30 when he came so I was already worn out but God is good thank God for a good wife amen who could take good care of our children brother Paul drown a longtime friend supporter brother streamer uh has a birthday on Wednesday he shares a birthday with Benjamin so we want to say and he is so faithful to amen virtually he texts his amens and I want you to know he is faithful he is faithful I don't ever have to worry about him being asleep while I'm preaching there's no way he could be asleep and keep texting as he does and he asked me several times does that good on your nerves I said not at all I appreciate the fact that you're there and that you're awake and uh I had a sweet text from Jennifer sister Jennifer Jernigan this morning I knew they were away we forget some time what all Luke does but Luke is a very important part of this church I'll tell you that he is busy and he is faithful and if he ever hears it said somebody needs to do something that he's capable of doing he always says I'll do it so that means he locks up he stays late sometimes to lock up the building and to be here early and sometimes he unlocks and he and and somebody said well the doors aren't aren't undog we call it and and I said well that might be a job that that Luke Jernigan usually does he's very rarely missing and so we miss them we miss Chad and of course we miss Levi they have not had a family vacation like this for this long of a period maybe ever I don't know if they've ever had this many days off but God has blessed Chad with a good job and a well-paying job and uh I'm very very grateful for his family I know that they're very very thankful to have that and uh had this beautiful text from sister Jennifer this morning that said thank you for praying for us we arrived safely and we are anticipating we're streaming this morning we're anticipating what the Lord has to say to us and I appreciate that even when they were away and not here I'm not thinking about them being in Amusement this morning I know that they're there hearing the word of the Lord and uh it's going to matter one day it's going to matter one day I I'm telling you it's going to matter one day so God bless them and then uh I guess one of Benjamin's best friends I don't know exactly how that happened but uh but Joseph we call him and he doesn't like it I've been told I I I I don't care just to be completely honest uh if I'm calling your name just be thankful that I can remember you by anything because sometimes I forget I call my own children the wrong name and uh I'm already at that stage of life and I know there's enough of you that will appreciate that you understand but uh otherwise Joseph haxon uh our JoJo has a birthday also on Benjamin's birthday I don't believe he'll be 26 how old will he be bethl 15 so I'm not the only one getting old Joseph we love you we thank you for all you [Applause] do he runs the show sometimes he has to do a lot when especially when his dad is gone he's responsible all of you streamers when when Hawk is gone you should really be I was looking up there but he's there I could just see the top of Hulk's head and and for all of a second there he looked young enough to be Joseph it it was just your hair he's rejoicing it was just your hair it wasn't your face anyway now I can look at Joseph he is faithful he'll run the camera he'll you streamers owe him a Deb of gratitude because he sometimes runs the whole stream and we're very thankful not only that he's the best shoe Shiner in the whole wide world and tenny pump cleaner what do they call them now we called them Tenny pumps what do they call them now kicks that's like a tennis shoe or something like that he can clean them he can make you think you've got a brand new pair and all moms and dads ought to be thankful for that because you know kids today they think if they're dirty they ought to toss them we don't toss shoes because they're dirty we clean them up as long as they fit right so you need to see Joseph help him build his business and you can give me my cut Joseph for the commercial and then uh Friday is Ashley's birthday uh uh Dave David I know that you now uh you know I don't want to say own her but I know now that she shares your name but I have yet to change it so uh in all of my things she is still Ashley TBO I guess I should back slash or hyphenate like they do in the modern world we all know that she's a Yantis um and if we don't know that David will tell us but we remember when she wasn't we didn't love her anymore then but we remember and so we want to wish her a very now she's a [Applause] mommy brother Donovan and sister Audrey don't often get to be with us but sister Audrey's a faithful streamer and uh I want to wish them a happy wedding anniversary uh excuse me a wedding anniversary on Friday as well we love you all even when we can't see you we still feel I still feel that you're a part of this body and we send you both our love and uh we know that it it's uh you know it's just today when I if I can and I hear that anybody's having an anniversary I try to greet them because we're living in a world today where they're married this year and next year they're not and so when someone celebrates another year of marriage I I appreciate it and I like it and I like that they made it amen they may not be all that they used to be you know we get older but thank God that if Jesus is the is The Binding part of your marriage you can make it last it can stand the test of time I don't have much hope for it if he's not in it I'll tell you that I'll just be honest because part of the spirit of leod deia is is to destroy marriages and so without him well we're just nearly fighting a losing battle aren't we yes and I miss Cade I'm so glad he had an opportunity to see his parents and we want to pray for him there's been a lot of sickness on that end and and we don't want it so we're believing the Lord that he'll be well and whole he just come through something not too long ago pretty uh severe sickness so we're praying that his antibodies are high amen uh then we've got this great group I I'm not going to sing I need my time but we have this great group of musicians and singers and worship leaders and even camera people and we're thankful for every one of them can we give them a great thank you and let them go we're blessed because of their giving to the lord they're giving and they're doing it volunteer and the least that we can do is pick up a piece of trash when we come across one and and and volunteer we can do something to serve the Lord we're serving the lord and serving the ministry and uh maybe you can't play my point was maybe you can't play an instrument or maybe you're you're not called on to play an instrument but there's always something that we can do I don't think any of us should have the attitude well that's sister Jennifer's job I think if you see a Kleenex on a Pew you know aren't you a parent and if you're a parent if you're a parent you're over the iys you know when you're not a parent you pick everything up like this you know but once you become a parent little snot no matter whose it is you just pick up the clean next and then go sanitize your hands uh clean up around the pews because uh I come through here sometime during the week and I think oh my goodness we've got some messy folks you're already insulted it only takes a few seconds to pick up your mess just a few seconds and we won't we don't charge you rent on your junk that you store here and so we're we we just think you ought to take your dirty things with you when you can everything we do you do it unto the Lord I mean it I I'm pretty bad because I'm the one when I go into an air you know an airplane bathroom that's that there's not much dirtier in the world than that and I see people going in there with their socks and I'm not going in there with my socks it may take me a while to put my shoes back on and and lay them up in time but I'm not going in there with my socks and people will use the water and the water will be all over the mirror and the counter and everything washing their hands and I'm the one who stays and wipes the counter down because I like for it to be clean when I go in when I'm in public at a washroom I wipe the counter down when I'm through not usually my water but somebody else's because somebody ought to do it somebody's got to do it why why it not be me I don't ever want to be that person who sweeps my side of the steps and leaves somebody else's you ever seen how people do some sometime cut their part of the ditch and won't even go an extra foot those are the same people who who uh will pay their tithe $70.49 oh it's quiet boy if I don't quit getting on folks you won't hear me when I preach let's stand God is good somebody say oh the time all the time God is good I mean he is good I want you to turn in your Bible this morning if you will please to acts and and that is not the Acts of the Apostles that is the acts of the Holy Spirit the holy ghost in the lives of the Apostles they never healed anybody they never cast The Devil out they never brought Deliverance anything they did they did because because they were a glove on the hand of the Lord and that gives me hope if God could use that rag tag mly crew of broken crackpots I know that the Lord can use you and I he can with all their failures he used them and all of their Brokenness he used them I know he can use us as well and it came to pass acts 16:16 as we went to prayer a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us which brought her master's much gain by soothsaying she was operating in telling fortunes and it was a profitable business Enterprise that she had going on and they were prostituting her out for witchcraft and becoming wealthy the same followed Paul and us and cried saying these men are the Servants of the most high God now let's see if we can get this right a damsel who was possessed by a spirit what kind of spirit did it say a spirit of divination this damsel possessed by a spirit of divination is following the men of God around the town and out of her mouth is declaring these men are the Servants of the most high God which show unto us the way of Salvation and this did she many days I want you to notice this I really want you to catch this she was declaring the same message day after day after day when Paul and the apostles would begin to minister the good news of the Lord Jesus Christ she would cry out in the service in the Gathering and every time she would say these are Servants of the most high God they show us the way of salvation but Paul being grieved not the first day not the second day not the third day we don't even know if it was on the 10th day I want you to follow the context of this scripture many days we don't know if that was a half a dozen or if it was 30 many days they said nothing and one day she did the same thing that she had always done she's Disturbed the me meeting like she had always Disturbed the meeting and this day it grieved Paul turned and said to the spirit not to the woman she was not the problem the spirit was the problem I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour no interview in process no tracing the roots to see where the spirit got in just come out of her in the name of Jesus Christ and when her Masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone they caught Paul and Silas and Drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers and brought them to the magistrate saying these men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city boy they got mad their pocketbook was going to be affected so they got on the legal train to try to shut down didn't matter what she was doing fooling people but it mattered that now their pocketbooks would be affected and they wanted to get some legal assistance we shouldn't be surprised right father you are good so good sometimes when we sing that we we think of really good is not enough popcorn and butter is good but Lord you are so much better you are so much good you are so much higher and more valuable to us forgive us Lord when our vocabulary fall short and that would be every day we cannot describe enough your faithfulness your worth in our lives and we can't imagine where we would be today without you lord you make the difference we are standing here today we are where we are today because of your grace because of your token life that has been applied to our life you have changed us from glory to glory which means we are still being changed by your presence and by Your glory we give you honor for bringing us here today in our right mind and anything that is accomplished it will be to your glory and to your honor we ask for this help in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory only and the Saints said am you may be seated so we are still in the series on cold love because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold in working our way through this subject we pulled in something that uh had been spoken to me in study in in study and in in prayer I didn't hear it as an audible voice I heard it in my inner man in my inner being but sometimes when God talks to us that way it can have even a greater effect than what we would hear with our natural ear when we hear it with our natural ear it might affect us momentarily but when God screams in our Inner Man somebody said well he don't scream he only speaks in a still small voice that's very inaccurate he speaks to us however we need to hear him and and I'm not like you that a that a whisper is All I Ever Need I wished I was that way that all he ever has to do is say uh uh uh uhuh and I'm done he does something and I do I respond sometime but there are times that I'm already uh twirling you know spinning and that little no son I don't want you to do that my inner man would hear it but my outer man even my soul my mind my will and emotions might be so far gone that I wouldn't be able to respond to that voice I'm so glad that God knows how to whisper I'm glad he knows how to shout sometimes he screams to us and when he does it reverberates through the spirit out toward the soul through the mind and the will and the emot emotions and it can have a profound effect that's how this came he was dealing with my heart about three different kinds of spirits that we would have to deal with uh as the bride of Christ now particularly in this season of testing we are being proved we are being tested somebody said well I have been since I found the Lord that's right but there are incredible intense seasons kah kahos moments where we can say that God is particularly putting his finger on some things in our life to see to to to watch and to observe how we will respond we are gradually passing the tests Hallelujah one by one we are learning to respond right amen we are learning to come back to Joy quicker we're learning to push our Humanity aside and our own will our own emotions aside to discern the voice of the Lord but we don't always get it and we have to uh enter into these moments of intense proving and testing you would think that most of us would be so far above some of these little imps but you have to understand that we're living in an hour of increasing evil evil is not shrinking it's not diminishing the love of many is waxing cold why because iniquity is not only present but it's abounding and so because iniquity abounds because it multiplies because it seems to be so successful we are finding a a a cold Edge forming in our love for him and in our love for one another when your love is cold you are easily distracted from the word you you you you don't burn with passion to hear the word of the Lord there was a time in this body of Believers uh here I go again uh there was a time in this body of Believers that if someone missed a service they wanted to see it they wanted to hear it they wanted to catch it because they understood that that truth comes in layers it comes line upon line it comes precept upon precept it's stacked on top of each other and so if you miss a a a little section of a subject it's possible that you'll have a gap in your in your foundational uh uh building and so uh there was a time some years ago that that from the youngest to the oldest those who were uh able enough they would hear they would see the service uh they would build upon it now it seems like more or less the older ones are the ones who really thrive in doing so I I get a a note sometime from some of them who say I I've not only sat through the service but I have now watched it two more times and I'm still uh gleaning from it I'm still pulling from it I know for me to mention that it almost sounds self-serving it almost sounds like I'm telling you that that you need to hear what I say but I'm really am you need to hear what I say because I hope that I'm not just here tooting my horn if there's any hope in me that I'm ever speaking on his behalf I don't think it's wrong for me to say hear me uh the Apostle said you you know uh you you follow me as I follow Christ if I'm not following Christ anymore then you don't follow me you follow him but God does this he establishes leadership Etc so uh I would encourage even young married couples busy busy busy raising their children but I would encourage them even to go back to to hear a section of it if you can't hear it all hear a piece of it I would still very much encourage you to hear the message of the hour to hear what God has preserved for us on tape and in book form we're very very blessed much spiritual food has been stored for us in due season we're not getting all of our food from the 60s and the 50s we're thankful that God is ever more revealing himself he's still a walking talking God and our foundation is found in Holy scripture we are thankful for the right interpretation of the word that comes by Revelation uh we're very thankful for that but we always want to keep Christ the word at the center of everything that we do because the enemy is going to howl and you want to know that when you're being how on and blown with Winds of of adversity and contrary winds you want to know that you're not going to blow over but that your roots are going to go deeper the more you you know toss back and forth your roots are being stimulated I I just read recently that when you are when you are taking a cutting from a living plant whether it would be a house plant or an outdoor plant and uh I fool around with that sometime I don't do much outdoor gardening anymore but I I fool around some time with indoor gardening and um you know just house plants so to speak and I like to propagate them I like to share them and I'm always thankful when somebody shares one with me but I recently read that you just stick them in the water uh most plants will root like like that in water you put them there you change the water every now and again and some will root almost immediately and some take longer depending on the species but I learned recently that there is a way to help speed the process that I never knew never thought about this before you see the water gets stagnant it settles and when it does the oxygen is sealed it's not released it's sealed and and I the article said that if you'll just take the glass ever so often and slos it around stirring up the molecules of the water that it releases the oxygen and the oxygen is what causes the plant to root I thought genius so simple but Genius of course that's something that would help and even in our own life right we can be surrounded by it but sometimes we need to stir ourselves up in it a little bit refresh ourselves in it so that Our Roots will form and go deeper and so the three spirits that were highlighted were number one a seducing Spirit which usually comes in the form of a lie that's an old trick it goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden amen and uh the LIE it has some truth to it always great portion sometime but the enemy just has a way of twisting the end of the story bending it away from the word and it deforms it it causes it to grow in a different direction and uh I am convinced that that in many cases those who have followed the message of the hour are farther away than they have ever been before because they have allowed this is just just a subset it it's not it's not uh perhaps the majority there are many out there who are following Christ the word you've got to hear my heart but the enemy will come and he'll Bend something a little bit he'll put a little too much emphasis on a man and and any time we get bent a little bit and we start putting too much emphasis on a man we're not getting closer to Christ we're getting further away from Christ John the Baptist was the first who returned in that installment uh in New Testament time in that installment of the spirit and power of Elijah and uh that commission was divided through Through the Ages according to Malachi 4 5 and 6 Malachi 3 talks about the messenger coming John the Baptist Malachi 45 and6 is a divided verse because we know that John the Baptist only fulfilled a portion of that commission there was to be another Prophet who would come in the spirit and power of Elijah because somebody had to fulfill the other part parents to children children to parents it had to be both ways somebody said well didn't they ask Jesus about that yes and he said you're right he must come but he has come now to me I know that that could be broke apart and criticized but I hear it in in in a in a different way than some people hear it I hear it with a revelation attached and when I hear it I hear Jesus saying you're right he is yet to come but he has already come that's what I hear somebody said that's not what it says well it kind of is and so for every article that might tell you that's not the way it is I I want to tell you I think that is the way it is somebody said well that's not how it's accepted by Orthodox well I've never desired to be orthodox anything anything I don't want to be an orthodox Jew I don't want to be an Orthodox Christian I know what Orthodox Christians do they pray to icons that's what the Greek Orthodox do I'm not interested in being Orthodox I just want to be a Bible believer I want to be a participant in the continuation of the book of Acts you know the the we understand there's another book of Acts that's being written even today because God is continuing to move among his people by the power of the Holy Ghost so I see that there was a need John the Baptist was forerunning the first coming fulfilling a portion of Malachi 4:5 and6 but there had to be another voice there had to be another servant well we're not all the time quoting John the Baptist and we're not all the time uh trying to learn about John the Baptist Baptist and when we talk to One Another We're not always constantly saying as John the Baptist said and what did John the Baptist say about it and and that's because we we don't see his role uh so huge that we would emphasize what he has to say so much and if we did to stay with me and if he if we did why then we would be going against his own words because his last commission the last thing that he wanted to leave us really he didn't have much to say in scripture did he but one thing we know that he did say I must decrease so that he might I got to get smaller so that he can get larger now I I agree that the second part of the commission is more significant than the first I agree that the need for this type of ministry was greater in our day in our time than it was even in the beginning because the church had gotten so very far off I think it's only right to mention the name the one who God used to fulfill that other part I'm not ashamed to use brother brandom's name I use it often I I like doing it I'm not ashamed shame to do it but I understand that in order for us to be in Christ and to pursue Christ we have to get our eyes on Christ and we have to be careful that we don't allow this messenger who came to point us to Christ we must be careful that we don't become enamored with the messenger that we don't run around the sign and miss the voice because every sign has a voice and it'd be like you going up to the stop sign and getting out of your car and running around the stop sign and screaming to your neighbor oh I've got a sign I've got a sign I've got a sign I've got a sign well that's great glad you recognize that God sent a sign what did the sign say the sign has a message it has a voice that's why I'm deeply concerned about all the people trying to get a drive driver's license the other day when my daughter was finally getting hers and they couldn't speak English and no one could communicate with them and they're going to make it somehow through a test and they're going to be given a license and they can't even communicate enough English to perhaps know what the sign is saying how many of you think it's important we don't always have a picture [Music] sometimes it has actual words on there and you might need to know how to read those signs because I may be coming along and you may be endangering my life because you don't know that the sign has a voice so we're following the voice not the sign and I think I believe with all my heart that brother Brandon would say to us today I must decrease amen you you must not hang on everything every little thing you you you must not get so caught up in arguing where the period should be or the comma should be you you really shouldn't be so enamored by how many times I knocked on the pull pit you should hear the voice I believe it's going to be critical for the bride that's why there's so many seducing Spirits loosed that will lie that will tell portion of the truth they have this whole process uh this whole thought process that's basically Guilty By Association and I want you to know that that doesn't stand up in a court of law you can be an accessory to a crime as long as it can be proven that you are aware of the crime is that right but you can't send someone off as a an accessory to the crime if you can't prove that they knew about the crime now it gets a little sticky when you're the getaway driver because somebody comes running out with a bag of money and a mask over their face and tells you to drive you need to know that's not Bagels in the bag and in those cases you might have not been at all aware of really what was going on you're just a driver but that mask that gun going in the holster and that bag and the alarm going off should have been enough to let you know I am participating in a crime and you can be sent away I don't think it's fair to make Jesus Christ guilty for everything that his people do I don't think we should condemn Jesus because some of his followers are weirder than weird and I don't think we should judge brother brandom or our pastor or anybody else our our Congressman for that M because of who they have to sometime associate with and the things of God It's Not Guilty By Association it it's are you on the word are you with the word Are you standing on the word so these Spirits manifest in various ways first of all the seducing spirit that is a lying spirit and then religious spirits that come as delusions and a delusion is such a possessive uh frame of mind a possessive thought process that will convince you that you are on the right Road when everything you're saying and doing is going against the word but you're so deluded and this is how uh men and women who burn in passion for for the same gender it's how that many of them have gone over the edge the Apostle tells us they have stepped across the line because they did not like to retain God in their knowledge he turned them over to a reprobate mind to believe a lie and be damned that doesn't mean that every person who has participated in that sin of immorality and perversion or any other sin for that matter it doesn't mean that they have crossed the line but what it does mean is some have already crossed that line because even knowing that it is sin they continue to follow those passions and those lusts and God says eventually in his time enough is enough you'll never find your way back to me now that's a hard cold reality we don't claim that for anybody we know in love but it is what the scripture said the delusion can become so heavy and you can even be so religious when they have the pride The Pride gatherings in downtown you can ask brother Shaw because he seen them their churches represented there pastors represented there under a religious delusion that that it's okay to be in in that lifestyle it's a strong spirit that takes a hold most of us are are dealing more or less with number three a familiar Spirit which we've talked about and we can't do too much talking now uh what we've already said but the word that is used there for familiar spirit I in in the scripture that we read to you and initially Leviticus 20 and6 it's a word that is pronounced OB and it is describing the The Familiar sound that's where we get the familiar from it is describing the familiar sound of opening a skin of water or a skin of wine because uh uh in biblical times uh skins were used inside out for storing liquid water or wine or even even olive oil and if if there was any air trapped in the bottle in the skin when the lid was opened it made a sound uh in in uh in Isaiah I believe it is there is a scripture that uses that word uh that is talking it's the word that's used there is ruach does anybody remember the word ruach it it's a Hebrew word for spirit and it can be God's spirit ruach hakodesh the Holy Spirit or it can just be ruach another Spirit another kind of spirit and so instead of using the word OB in this particular place in Isaiah they use the word ruach to let you know that this is a familiar sound everyone knew what was happening nobody jumped nobody ran out of the room when that little uh uh gust of of of air would come out of the bottle that's the word that's used for a familiar Spirit we talked about how that these Spirits can run reconnaissance how that they can can be monitoring spirits and they can pick up words that are spoken and they can carry a matter it's not a bird I told you Tuesday night it's not a bird that's carrying the matter it's a metaphoric bird it's a SP spirit and it'll sometimes make sure that you know something about somebody that you're really not supposed or really shouldn't or have no business knowing but that's how these enemies work these Spirits like to pit people against one another I want you to hear what I'm saying they want to make enemies out of friends they want to make it so awkward that you can't be in the room together when you're Believers and we sometimes have to take authority over that thing and say you're not going to do that in my life uh you know we just realize that the reality is there is somebody somewhere that doesn't like you and there is somebody somewhere talking about you not everybody but somebody and if that bothers you just go in and be bothered but eventually you'll have to grow up and you'll have to real let them talk you know old people they get to a place as they get older uh it don't matter to them as much what people say they they feel like they've earned the right you know I'm already there I'm 56 years old I don't expect to live another 56 years on this planet I'm already past my middle age and and so I I just might say something that I that I would normally say I'm not going to cuss I'm not talking about using uh uh curse words but I'm talking about you know okay I used to hear the oldtimers say well that's all right let them talk if they're talking about me they're giving somebody else a rest that's easy to say a little harder to pull off but I'm almost to that place just go ahead and say if you need to say it say it but I'm going to just keep on going we used to sing that song folks May uh false accuse me and scandalize my name but I'm going on with Jesus just the same where else will I go and should I let you be my judge or should I work to please him so yeah I I wish I could tell you that everybody likes you I I wish I could tell you that everybody likes your haird and your choice of of dress but they don't and you can choose to let that bother you hinder you breach a relationship but you just need to realize you're going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with everything that you think you're going to decide whether or not you'll let it stop you or slow you or impede you or not I say no that this word familiar spirit in the Latin remember it comes from the description of a household servant so it's a spirit that serves a person by gathering by by by doing lots of things by by having a a a hold a a influence on even personality and behavior can person be possessed with a spirit like that they can but most likely uh and more often a familiar spirit is one that oppresses because it needs to be free to move about through the family line it needs to be free to move about from one member of a family to another member of a family and so more or less it influences from the outside in somebody say that somebody said well that's good well is it good I don't know it it might be slightly better but it's still not an ideal situation if we should come to an understanding that a spirit is influencing how we choose how we behave how we act what we say we ought to be concerned about it we should be concerned about it now Tuesday night we talked about disruption disruption and an inappropriate disturbance or or eruption that interrupts normal and common plans and programs you can just always depend on certain folks to interrupt the program always late always arriving a tither never bring peace with them when they move are you saying that everyone like I'm not I'm not saying that everyone like that is under the influence of a familiar Spirit but I'm telling you that these Spirits operate so familiarly that we sometimes blame them on personality without realizing that it's not a change in personality we need it's a form of Deliverance it can run by the line of iniquity through a family not just one to a generation it could be multiple to a generation on occasion everybody's going to be running late it's going to happen but there are also Spirits familiar spirits and one of the ways they operate is to disrupt and how you can begin to kind of notice how this thing will work is a normal uh Behavior Uh if someone is late their normal behavior would be to slip in it's going to get a little tight cuz I'm going somewhere in a little while you might as well get it over with now I'm going to take my time you know just kind of slip in but when a spirit is involved you'll find that that person under the influence of that thing uh will will everything they do they draw attention so there is no slipping in quietly it's it's rare that that would H everybody in the room just about is going to know they've arrived come on and that is disruptive at the very least it's wrong because it's disruptive but it could possibly be the characteristics of being under the influence of a familiar spirit that has been invited into your life by an iniquity that has not been broken in a family line sometimes described as going from zero to 100 interruptive Behavior to incre you you're talking to someone and and all of a sudden you're you're you're just expressing yourself and you trigger something in them and sometimes now now look we're going to talk about manipulation in a moment and sometimes that Spirit the spirit of manipulation and coercion will cause uh someone to press your button because they like to see you erupt that's a generational trait too and they know just what to say are you with me they know just what to say to get you to explode and they like to push that so that is certainly a reality but also that that this Spirit of disruption you're talking to someone and that thing gets on them it comes on them it raises up on them and the next thing you know you you're being like yelled at and harassed and you're really taken back now if you're a manipulator you know what you did and you deserve what you get but if you're not you're standing there sincerely wondering what did I say because you may not be aware of the trigger but the spirit is and I dare say if you won't go back a generation you'll find somebody that had the same trigger language and maybe more than one in a generation and if you go back you'll probably have well look folks I don't want to live by triggers I want to be able to control myself I want to be able to control my behavior I want to be able to control my thoughts and I particularly want to be able to control what comes out of my mouth hello so we need to be aware of this kind of disruptive behavior it can certainly rule in a child's life and it can rule in an adult's life and we don't want any part of it at all to increase explosively in intensity to shift from a calm state to an agitated state in a very short amount of time I'm reading on these Spirits sometimes manifest to draw attention from something of remember Tuesday night we talked about things that can happen in a church service to draw someone's attention I want you to know the enemy doesn't care who he uses and as much as we want to encourage our children to be free to Worship the Lord we also want to be mindful of how they're moving their body because even even small children can come under the influence of that kind of a spirit that causes them to perform you know it's probably true that there is a ballerina locked up in every little girl so to speak there's something about a girl in a twirly skirt that makes her want to move nothing wrong with spinning or moving or and that's perfectly in line and in order in the house and home and but when they come to church it's your responsibility as a parent to kind of help guide them just a little without crushing their spirit because sometimes if they catch someone's eye it becomes a little bit of a performance hips are twisted oh you didn't want me to get this plane did you that we don't want no no part of that we want them to understand there's an appropriate way now when they're tiny tiny we can't we you know it's very hard to explain those kinds of things to them but we can't look away forever because if it is becoming a distraction to someone else it's not serving the purpose of worship so all things have to find a balance I hesitate to ever honestly to say anything like this to bring a balance because I know that some parents are not balanced and their answer to everything is stop you just can't do it no more well that's wrong and if you think that's what I'm saying you're misunderstanding me we don't want to squelch the freedom that a child needs to learn now because we don't want them to become like we rigid stiff inhibited intimidated to worship God we want them you know we've been criticized for 30 plus years because the children used to run around when people were worshiping they would run I don't care what you folks say it doesn't matter to me that you've of all the things you could criticize you chose that I would rather them learn freedom to express themselves that way now than to have to cast a religious devil off of them when they're 50 because they sin against the Holy Spirit by quenching him quench not the Holy Spirit that's a scripture it's a sin to quench him it's a sin to sit down on him so what are you really try a balance in all things we don't ever want to be so disruptive so distracting even in a service even with our worship as an adult we don't ever want to become so distracting that we're drawing attention to us instead of him it's him it's him that we want people to look at do you agree in the message early spiritual experiences in paragraph 27 brother bandam said now they were all muddled up in their Doctrine and Devils out there fortune tellers uh was the only ones them was not not the only ones but ones that was wck recognizing him to be what he was the Apostle and recognizing the apostles to be what they were men of God it was fortune tellers and Devils that recognized it first it's what brother brandham is telling us so Paul turned and rebuke that Spirit of divination from the woman why well I'm giving you an answer because in that particular day she was being disruptive she was always is telling the truth these are men of God who show us the way of Salvation she was not in order she was not out of order to tell the truth but she was out of order and yielding to the spirit of divination when she began to be distracting with it you see it's one thing to go through the crowd and say listen I want you to listen to these guys you've got to hear what they have to say because they are showing us the way of Salvation some of that could have actually been coming out of a hunger to get rid of the devil that was leading her and all of a sudden follow the way of Truth the way of Salvation it's one thing to go around and and and hand out a note that says listen I want you to listen these men have the way of Salvation or to go around Whispering a little bit but on this particular day she became so disruptive with her confession of Truth Now I want you to hear what these men are saying on no no you be quiet so people can hear but that particular day Paul caught that and he turned around and rebuked the spirit of divination from the woman she couldn't tell no more fortunes he didn't need the devil to testify who he was he knowed who he was he was God Saint and let me just go ahead and tell you that the devil cannot predict the future you need to understand that now he knows what the word said better than some of us but he can't predict the future so how do fortune tellers operate well they have a genuine gift but they're using it under a false anointing and the false anointing that they're using to to operate this gift is a familiar spirit so they're not getting the information from Holy Spirit they're getting the information from familiar spirits that might just be might be just as accurate because these familiar spirits they are monitoring the situation and they will feed to the person under the spirit of divination the information that they need to speak over the person person that's exactly right that could be a gift from God it it could be a gift even that God is using by his Spirit it could be a gift that is genuine from God but yielded to a false anointing or to a wrong Spirit did I confuse you with that brother brandham tells us the gifts and callings of God are without repentance brother brandham goes to a fair one day and a fortune teller sees him walking by calls him over and begins to tell him the truth about his life he said she had a genuine gift but she didn't get that information from the same source that he was getting his information from when he stood they're Discerning the hearts of the people same gift same kind of gift but not the same Source you understand and so someone can actually step out from under the right source and continue to operate in a gift that has nothing to do with true Discerning of spirits it's actually information that's being fed to them by monitoring familiar Spirit are you clear so he said he didn't need the devil to testify who he was he knowed who he was he was God's Saint he didn't need the devil's help but the devil was telling the truth about him anyhow Jesus told the devil said hold your peace come out of him it was a her he didn't need the devil's help but the devil was screaming nothing different than what had been going on many days but this particular day it manifested in a disruptive manner I just want to I just want that to sink in may I have some water while you sea pause and think on that dancing for instance can be a genuine expression of one's gratitude and praise to God for freeing them from a place of bondage but if it is stirred or provoked by a familiar spirit that operates in a disruptive manner then what what you've been doing your expression maybe the same step same manner that you've had for years glorifying God in truth but if you're prodded or poked influenced by a wrong Spirit doing the same thing you've always done can now become a manifestation of A disruption that can break down the service and it can actually distract from something much more important that needs to be said or needs to be seen if you think you understand what I'm saying I I want to pause for you to say amen amen maybe you do maybe you don't I don't know because when that disruption begins to be a hindrance we come to part two here a hindrance is a resistance that causes delay a barrier or obstruction to slow progress have you ever felt like you were spinning your tires in the mud have you ever felt like a Geral on a proverbial gerbal wheel going fast all the time sweating fast heart rate going nowhere spending all of your energy are you with me I hope you're being taught and that's why you're quiet spending all of your energy but really taking no ground wearing yourself out like one who's beating the air but never punching the enemy are you following me that spirit Spirit a familiar Spirit can operate eruptive and disruptive it can also operate in a way to hinder to slow down to impede progress slow progress an obstruction an unusual and this is out of the ordinary for most people tendency in a person's life to seemingly attract hindrances and conflict this can be the results of a manifestation of a familiar spirit that has followed a family through generational iniquity I want to say it that way each time because I want you to understand you may be under the influence of something like this and not be evil and not be bad be a child of God be wanting to make it like everybody else around you but but finding these hindrances these things popping up in your life because you've just never taken the time to realize this is not who I am this is not my personality this is the influence of a spirit some people have weird personalities you know some people don't really want to work they want to eat but they don't really want to work for it some people will never be successful because all they're doing is looking for success without a great amount of effort I have a poor friend who's buried now who actually died here attending a meeting some years ago and if he had flaws he did we were close enough friends for me to know them he always believed that the next thing was going to be the thing the next investment was going to be the thing I told him years before I'm not giving you another penny for anything I'll buy your lunch but I'm not investing in any more of your scams well he said I'm not in I'm not in no I know you're not trying to cheat me you sincerely believe that you're going to bless me and I'm going to bless the ministry and we're all going to be wealthy I don't know how many envelopes came to my house with all these cards with all this information with all this stuff I don't know how many times I've been gifted foreign currency from all kinds of countries because one day it was going to hit big again and I could cash the the currency and it was going to make me Rich and there was an island in the sea where where a king had been wealthy and he hid the money and they were going to find the money and I had been given I've got a a file cabinet full I I I want you all to know I'm rich the problem is what I'm rich in has no value I have tons of currencies and and and uh that are never going to be worth anything and I wanted to believe in all of them but listen that can be the manifestation of a spirit that really just wants to hinder you from working your way into success some people will never be married because their expectations of what they deserve are much higher than what they have to offer I'm just being very real I'm talking about about men who will say I I don't want a wife that's overweight why she's going to be eventually anyway most likely and and you're going to have a dad B the problem is I've noticed that sometimes men who say things like that have already got their dad B and they're not a dad but they know what they want they remind me of that brother in the north I loved him who decided that he had a great list of things he wanted for his wife and he didn't ever want he didn't want to marry a girl who had ever worn a t-shirt he was so convicted that a woman should not wear a t-shirt no matter how feminine it was what color it was because it pertained to a man and he said I don't ever want a wife that has ever wore a t-shirt did you know that I said to him brother babies they may snap between the legs but a onesie is really no more than a t-shirt so you find me a baby that hadn't worn a cotton onesie you find me a woman that hadn't wor I think you better find a baby in the cradle and convince the parents to raise her like you want her and then face the weird looks that you're going to get when she's 14 and you marry her because you may never find I don't want a woman that's ever worked a day in her life not even a lemonade stand see sometimes we can get caught up in our huge expectations it's Pride we think we're a bigger prize men men I'm telling you men are bad we are bad we have a tendency to think we're a bigger prize than we really are sisters can operate the same way never have a husband because they've got this you know unhealthy idea did you know that could actually be a spirit now you should say your goals high but I want you to know that most of the time what matters to them doesn't matter really in the long run if you don't want your wife to wear a t-shirt tell her before you marry her don't Court her and then tell her on the wedding day I'm not going to allow you to wear a t-shirt go ahead full disclosure tell it all but she probably has worn one before that's in the past she's being redeemed now move past it folks don't allow spirits to hang around from from iniquities in generational lines that will try to hinder everything you try to do in your life there's certain people that just attract a hindrance and they attract a conflict and they attract a trouble that's no it's no shame there's nothing to be condemned of but if if it's a spirit we want to send that Spirit packing that's right can you say Amen they seek to prevent let me see let's let's go on hindering Spirits which includes familiar spirits work to steal kill and destroy by thwarting your progress toward a goal or a destination they seek to prevent you from moving forward by keeping you locked in your here's the word again familiar past they delay impede hamper and hold you back in various facets of Life most importantly in your first Thessalonians 2 let's see what time it oh I'm doing good first thessal you didn't think so but I did 1 Thessalonians 2:177 and 18 but we Brethren being taken from you for a short time in presence not in heart endeavoring the more abundantly to see your face with great desire wherefore we would have come unto you even I Paul once and [Music] again but read it Satan hindered us can we say it again Satan hindered us somebody he said isn't God Sovereign Satan hindered us now how could he do that yeah God allowed it that doesn't necessarily mean it was in the perfect plan of God especially if this hindrance is coming to you because of a familiar spirit that needs to be dealt with he allowed it but it may not be his perfect will he might be allowing you to go into your permissive will his permissive will and let me remind you though that God is such a redeemer that the prophet said that God knows how to let you being in his permissive will serve to bring you to his well I believe that I believe every misstep is another opportunity if we let it be that God can move and squeeze us closer push us closer to his perfect plan for our life but as I said to you in Friday's text don't settle don't settle for his permissive will if you realize that you're not in the perfect will of God stop don't keep going stop wait on the Lord seek his face and let him direct your steps Satan hindered Us in the message person perseverance are you good for a few more minutes let's pray now he said for these cloths here our heavenly father they they taken from the body of St Paul handkerchiefs or aprons and it said that unclean spirits went from them we realize that we're not St Paul but we know that you're still the same Jesus for you're just as much alive today as you was in the days of St Paul I pray for these requests Lord that these handkerchiefs represents little cloths and handkerchiefs and little boots for the babies I pray God that you'll Grant it he said we're taught that Israel was on its March to the promised land a great Pillar of Fire went before them are you here a prophet represented them represented God for them on the earth and this Prophet LED them out to the Dead Sea we might say the Red Sea and it shut off the road it shut off the road there was something in the way while they were walking in the line of duty you may be walking in the line of duty a spirit may want to try to block you in hem you in contain you God looked down out of the heavens through the pillar of fire and the Sea got scared and it rolled back back and opened up the road right through the Red Sea for Israel to go on the path of Duty and they went to the promised land you understand on the path of Duty the enemy raised up something to hinder them they didn't let it stop them he said God when these handkerchiefs are laid upon the sick and The Afflicted look he said Satan has crossed cross the line I I want you to start using that devil you have crossed the line you are hindering me from my path of Duty he said let the power that raised up our Lord who's present now come upon these handkerchiefs good good good good good it's good and whenever they touch the sick May the devil get scared just like the Red Sea was scared let the devil get scared while he looks down through the blood of Jesus Christ and may every one of them be healed loosed delivered set free May every one of them shove every familiar Spirit out of their life breaking the spirit of iniquity Grant it Lord may they continue on in the path of Duty Grant it Lord we thank you your presence is here oh this glorious anointing of your spirit that shakes we mortal beings Lord how we thank you for your goodness bless these now in Jesus name it's from the message perseverance which means we have to press on we can't let these Spirits hinder us forever procrastination we can't let these Spirits h hinder us forever in the message we would see Jesus I hope you'll pay close attention to this he said what if there was a stock of corn growing and a chunk was laying on it like a limb like the lwh hanging limb of a tree it had grow crooked he said of course it would he had that experience he saw in the field hunting on the edge of the field he saw corn that had been bent down by low hanging Limbs and the corn looking for the light of the sun had found its way around the limb and continued to grow hindered affected handicapped deformed but still trying to grow so this is how hindrances can be it grow crooked pick up move every obstacle that's hindering and the Sun that is sticking up towards it'll finally grow that stock of corn right out straight again you turn your plants because they grow toward the Sun and they'll just start leaning out the window and you turn them so that they'll they're sticking out this way but guess what they'll start leaning that way again that's the same kind of principle he said cast out an evil spirit then the people say well wasn't nothing happened to me you grow right back straight you may not realize when a spirit is told to go especially if it's oppressing you and not possessing you but brother brandom said you move that hindrance and you start growing straight again so you may not feel feel like something glorious has taken place but how many of you know it's a good thing to grow straight we don't want to grow crooked we don't want to grow deformed we want to be right upright amen he said if you believe that and know that something's happened to you there's nothing to keep you from straightening right back again you just hold on to it my that is good and as sure as the S so n who controls all eternal life if it strikes that germatize predestinated seed something happens it takes a hold and there it holds there twist its way through every obstacle there is finally it sticks his head up and said praise God I knew it was so he said that's it that's Faith believe it don't just make believe be a believer genuine these spirits will anoint people as frustrators of purpose to stand in your way it's a spirit doing it we don't fight peoples we fight Spirits are you still here are you still awake these spirits will anoint people as frustrators of purpose to stand in your way and block your progress you need to deal with them somebody said well I've got to I'd have to reach over to somebody else's oh no no no no no no it's probably closer to home than you realize it's probably generation it's probably iniquity that hasn't been broken in your own family line it's not you looking for another family in the church to blame them for the spirit that's trying to hinder you we're not on a Witch Hunt we're looking internal we're looking inside in Ezra 4 4 and five in the Amplified just to save a little time not reading both then the Samaritans the people people of the land continually weakened the hands of the people of Judah and troubled and terrified them in building and hired counselors against them to do what frustrate their purpose and plans all the days of Cyrus King of Persia even until the reign of daras the second King of Persia they hired men to counsel them to frustrate their purpose to tell them it can't be done you're wasting your time it'll never happen that way you might as well quit all stirred up by a spirit that wants to hinder are you following me good I've got to move on and I have to get a little more of this out before we stop Third Way manipulation manipulation and intimidation you understand how they work but remember this before we get into this one some people blame intimidation on everything that happens in their life I was intimidated to get prayer I was intimidated to ask for prayer I was intimidated to get a pastor's advice I was intimidate look folks these Spirits can never be your excuse and some people walk in a constant state of intimidation and like to blame it on a person he intimidated me she intimidated me when there is a great possibility that you're the one that's dealing with that kind of a spirit and the enemy is causing you to constantly feel intimidated like everybody is trying to control you when in reality the enemy is trying to Bluff you and make you think that everybody has got time to rule in your business so it works both ways I want to say that before we start manipulation means to control or play upon by Artful unfair or Insidious means especially to one's own advantage to gain power or influence over someone and now we're taking this as a spirit a familiar Spirit of manipulation that runs in Family Lines to control or to play upon by Artful unfair or Insidious means which means dishonest Unholy means especially to one's own advantage to gain power or influence to control someone else this is one of the tightest Spirits in Family Lines a spirit of manipulation it runs from generation to generation and I suggest that if you're going to marry a young woman whose mother is controlling that you pray long and hard and you be honest and open and forthright because that is a spirit that runs in family lines and you don't want to become the victim of that you don't want to teach your children how to manipulate their spouses you want that thing to stop mother may not be evil it may be her father he may not be evil but the problem with the spirit of manipulation is if it doesn't get its way it'll lie it'll cheat it'll steal it'll give fake press if if it doesn't S consider itself successful in controlling someone else's life it'll get Unholy in a hurry it'll tell a ball faac lie that spirit will anoint someone to look you in the face tell you a straight out lie to try to control your reaction that's a family thing that's a generational thing that's an iniquity thing it can be broken it must be broken we shouldn't even really make this joke and I I'm not putting all this on women but we shouldn't really make this joke you know yeah I'm the head I've heard women say it often he's the head but as they say I'm the neck that turns the head well first of all you don't want to be the neck that turns the head can the Saints say Amen you sisters don't want that responsibility because if you assur if you usurp the authority of a husband you're going to Bear the responsibility before God that a husband has to Bear a dad and a and a husband they're going to answer to God for the way they treat their wife and children stepchildren too they're going to answer to God for that if a wife is constantly trying to be the neck that turned down I know I I I need to say that some of you have learned to live in controlling and abusive situations by very carefully tiptoeing around the Tulips the problem with that is if your children see you manipulating even for a noble cause you see women will sometimes learn how to ask their husband something for their children to do dad said no so they go to mom somebody said really brother Shelly we don't need this sermon this morning there's no one in this house guilty of that are you kidding me you you ought to pay me double this week not tell me that you don't need it you ought to give me a big old raise for telling you this because it's nothing but the truth I understand that some dads and husbands have such a personality that a wife has to learn to be creative and crafty sometime and even Pres ing something but you've got to be very careful walking down that road because you can easily fall under the influence of a spirit that manifests itself as a manipulation as a manipulative spirit and it's not just getting the kids permission to go over to somebody else's house it becomes the next thing and the next thing and the next thing and the next thing and and and here's what you'll find if dad cares enough to ask a question when confronted a spirit will hardly ever tell the truth as long as you don't confront a spirit it it'll it'll it'll sometimes speak the truth but once you confront a spirit it'll hardly ever so if a dad asks back or pushes back if a woman is under that manipulation Spirit uh she would lie very quickly just a minute I hope nobody goes home this afternoon and fusses text me if you do don't do that don't go and listen listen listen now let me tell you something else while we're on the subject stop using me stop using using me to prove your point didn't you hear Brother Shel say didn't you hear the pastor say leave me out of your trouble you understand people only quote me when it suits them and let me tell you something you use that on your wife I hope she remembers a dozen more powerful things that I said that she can use right back that's not the way to do things you you think sometime you can do that and it and they'll listen more but folks that doesn't create the right it's like Mama telling wait till daddy gets home it's not the right kind of environment to produce h a mother doesn't need to always say wait till daddy gets home wait till daddy gets home wait till daddy gets home because that's putting too much pressure on Daddy a mother's going to have to learn to discipline too there are certain cases that need to go to a higher Court but some can be settled in the lower courts do you understand because when Dad gets home it shouldn't always be a fearful event sometimes it needs to be a happy event or am I telling you the truth so watch that manipulation thing don't allow that to get into your marriage into your relationships it's a spirit it's wrong it's not a personality problem and if they inherited it from their mother or father it's because it's a spirit manipulation is not genetic manipulation doesn't come through the DNA it comes by the influence of a wrong spirit so shake out from under that now he said some it goes on to say someone influenced by a manipulative spirit will turn everything you're doing and worked hard to do upside down for his own or her own personal benefit when a spirit is in operation it doesn't care the collateral damage or who gets hurt in the process it's just to prove a point to exercise control and we know that it happens in ministries and we know that there are spiritual leaders who use their influence to abuse and that is wrong it is demonic that is not how we lead by by a spirit of intimidation or manipulation that is wrong whoever is guilty that is wrong spirits of manipulation will use any tool they can get advantage of here's the three that I want to mention quickly disrespect when the manipulator senses any sort of disagreement or eroding influence he or she it's a demon but using a person will also accuse the target hoping to gain control and influence with the one who made the original complaint why do we always have to agree with someone when they come and bring us a bad report can we not ever say I don't agree are we as children of God uh not capable of saying no disrespect intended but I don't agree with your summation of what happened I I don't share your opinion you don't have to share mine I don't have to share yours but nine times out of 10 we dig in our bag somebody will bring us a negative report and we dig in our bag of memories to see if we can find something that we can relate that complaint to and we say You know what last year I had a similar experience with that person and they did the same thing to me 12 months ago a year ago did you have to why couldn't you have just said you know lately that has not been my experience at all we need to pray more and talk less we don't realize how manipulative these Spirits can operate and you're sucked in and all you're doing is noding your head and saying amen but you're sucked in and what happens when that Spirit gets a pat on the back it doesn't shrink I'm going to read that again because it's getting Mighty tight in here when the manipulator senses any sort of disagreement or eroding influence he or she will also accuse the target hoping to gain control and influence with the one who made the original complaint looking sometimes people the spirit in in a person using a person is fishing and we're too dumb to realize it thank you you know you can preach and not yell right they're fishing to find our vulnerability to find our little place where we have a problem with that person and the next thing you know we're two at a time we're talking so fast and so loud that we're not even hearing the other person we're just unloading all of these past memories are just rolling out and we don't realize that we're just strengthening that Spirit on the manipulator and they'll go into the next situation this works on your jobs in a house in a church in a family did you know that Spirit of manipulation will pout let don't let me get ahead of myself number two gossip the person under a spirit of manipulation will often help to spread rumors about the target hoping to find someone who would agree with them therefore gaining influence over those already struggling Ling with what with authority number three guilt the these spirits will often anoint people to attack you for not doing enough while blaming you for their own slackness I I better read that one again these spirits will often anoint people to attack you for not doing enough you're not doing enough while blaming you for their own slackness guilt is often the tool of choice oh it's getting extremely tight not just your quietness but the atmosphere squeezing up it's like a python in here guilt is often the tool of choice to force another person to forsake their own Vision their own goal their own direction to take up someone else's guilt husbands don't manipulate your wife with guilt wives don't use guilt on your parents don't use that on your children children be careful how you would use that on your parent church folks be careful how we use guilt to get our way you know it's no it's no it's no real uh shock when some people cry cuz some people just cry they got leaky heads like mine they just cry when I hear something unfair I cry it touches me and I get too involved emotionally when I read one of these tragic stories on the internet about a van accident and young Ministry and missionaries died and all I want you to know that really hurts my feelings so you shouldn't be fooled you shouldn't be you know necessarily persuaded because I Cry Sometimes that fools people I don't use it to fool people but sometimes people are fooled by tears and they think oh he was so sincere she was so broken she was so he was so sorry for what he had done and sometimes it's not really sincere repentance it's a spirit of manipulation that has run in generational lines through iniquity I hope you're listening as you're moving to cause someone to feel guilty and do what you want them to do don't don't don't let tears be what moves you don't let guilt be what moves you you've got a you've got a control tower you've got a leadership that comes from inside come on now don't you give in to somebody's cries because their feelings got heard and some people like I said can cry at the drop of a hat and they're not all women I just confess you I'm a person who cries a lot so you know just because you see me cry don't don't go out of here and think you know well I better just do everything he said because he was really crying over that he was really broken about that I might have been I most likely was I'm using myself as an [Music] example but how many of you know guilt will cause you to do a lot of things Proverbs 26 are you still here good I may call a service tonight Proverbs 26: 24 and 25 he that hateth deth with and layeth up deceit within him when he speaketh Fair believe him not for there are seven Abominations in his heart you can be sincere and be sincerely wrong a politician can be passionate and wrong preachers can be passionate and wrong it's not by words it's not by only what comes out of a lip but it's what's going on in the heart let me see if the complete Jewish Bible will help you on this verse he who hates May hide it with his speech but inside he Harbors deceit it's a spirit on a man on a woman he may speak pleasantly but don't trust him for seven Abominations are in his heart smooth smooth speech but inside deceit that's what a spirit will do especially if it gets uh strengthened in a generational line now in the message what do you who do you say this is he said what happened if I could just get a little further what happened Methodist all down Through the Ages zwingley Finley finny all of the rest of them when they had a Revival what did they do with it throwed it right into a denominational feast and crawled in how sad crawled in with the rest of them put a brand on you like the rest of them now listen then you've got a bunch of man controlling you the Holy Spirit can't move no farther because man has taken control right he said that's exactly you start to preach something the Bible teaches like that and the denomination don't believe that they'll put you right out try it once and see if it's right or not you'll see that it's the truth see at denominational Feast every time they're called to it that balum Feast trouble sets in oh Luther Wesley Pentecost all of them are victims of it when man tries to control what belongs to God not following the leadership of the spirit based on the truth of the word even around a message of Truth like ours if man starts exercising control do you know how powerful it is to put all the blame on somebody that's dead do you know how powerful it is for a man to stand here and tell you believe everything he said speaking of brother brandom do you know how powerful that is because then brother brandham has no responsibility to come and explain himself that's how people can use quotations to manipulate situations because you don't get to ask brother brandom and you don't get to ask the preacher because in a lot of places if you ask the preacher they're very offended and they say uh uh you know we don't question the prophet sometimes they'll say show me that in the word we don't question the prophet all thus sayith the Lord you know how powerful that is that a I used to hear them say who would do that what Minister would do that in their right mind there's no benefit to that oh but there really is a lot of benefit to that because you can manipulate people by using the the the various sets of quotes that say different things it's going to get very quiet in here huh you keep convincing people it's all thus sayith the Lord it's all that sayith the Lord then you can lift a quotation out of context beat the people with it get them to do whatever you think they ought to be doing and brother brandham is blamed but he has no way of coming and explaining himself you know there he he might have possibly if he were alive today he might have possibly updated his method not his gospel but his method he might have made an adjustment to church order he might have said hey we you know we can sing something that I don't I I I must have given you the impression that everything had to be written 40 years ago to sing it but I didn't mean to give you that impression he he might say a lot but he can't so it's very manipulative sometime the way people use the quotes ministers always use the quotes to try to keep people under a sense of control and when there comes time to question well I can't speak for brother brandom you know I just that's just what he said so really there's no one to put any responsibility on it all do you see how the enemy could even use a great truth like we have to really put man in control you you listen I want to tell you something somebody in this church were to come up to me and tell me that brother bam was their Pastor you be prepared for me to tell you go home stay home hear you a tape send your tithe to Jeffersonville and see how all that works out for you but there are people who will attend churches in this message and tell others in that church the pastor is not my pastor brother bram's my pastor isn't that convenient isn't that convenient sit in a church eat the man's groceries and send your tithe somewhere else and then you have no responsibility to do what the pastor asked because he's not really your pastor you don't belong to be in a church that's right you just stay home then that's right that's right and it goes on I have people D all well I go to so- and- so's church but he's not my pastor who is who is it's control control of a different level the unity of one God in the one church he said but the working of the Holy Spirit the kingdom of God in you God sits on the throne of your heartall in his control room controlling your emotions and controlling your powers and controlling your conceptions and making you one with him in fellowship and in love and God fills you with love he filled you with power he filled you with his Spirit he fills you with his own divine nature and he changes your carnal nature into his nature then in this you become a new creation in Christ we got to be controlled we have to have something to control us it's not men and it's not manipulative spirits but there is a control that sits on the throne if we get all the junk off he'll sit on the throne and he will control our conceptions and powers and and make us one with him how many of you are glad of that and then I'll just mention this last one in closing to give you a little something to because we got to go musicians are coming we have a little baby to dedicate so we have had disruption that's one of the ways of familiar Spirit can manifest hindrance and now we have had manipulation and then the last for for now and I won't get too far into it just the sort of the definition confusion the spirit those familiar spirits they Thrive if they can confuse you so that you don't know the mind of God they don't want you to have Clarity they don't want you to fully Embrace God's will for your life and they'll cross Family Lines if necessary to confuse you to frustrate you to keep you from being able to make a stand for the will of God they will bring disorientation if we could put that up they'll bring disorientation bewilderment turbulence and turmoil do you know people who seem to be caught up in a swirl of disorientation bewilderment I don't understand turbulence and turmoil bringing upheaval and chaos leaving others unsure and unable to process or proceed that confusing devil is so contagious that it will paralyze other believers it will put a fear in them to step out and to be obedient in their own lives because they're caught up in the confusion of the atmosphere it's not just your family that I want us to consider and be concerned about it's other families as well when a confusing spirit is visiting and they do it can affect multiple people and multiple families it's the spirit of Babylon it operates politically and it operates religiously to control people's minds when you hear the foolish opinions of of liberals in this world and you say to yourself how could anybody be so stupid this is your answer it's spirits of confusion that constantly keep turmoil in the atmosphere just so you won't know what to think what to do I can see how the enemy uses confusion in this hour to paralyze spiritual growth have you ever talked to somebody and when you were through you didn't know any more at the end of your conversation than you did in the beginning you hoped to have a better understanding of where they were coming from but when they got through you were almost more confused than you were when you started and it's not because they're not eloquent it's it's not because they're not articulate it's because a spirit is in the atmosphere it it's that twisting Spirit the spirit that operates like leviathon that twists and confuses and bewilders and causes turbulence and turmoil and confusion and we just feel like we have to just sometimes take it but we don't because the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 14:33 three let's stand a oh I already called the musicians for God say this with me for God not is not whoa whoa whoa for God is not the author of confusion hold is it confusing then God is not the author of The confusion God is not the author of confusion you know these Spirits I know you're standing good for you they they're they're so twisting now you know how I feel about through the years I have told you how I feel about questions and answers and I think some of it is a shame I I think it's a shame some of the questions that people ask brother brandham because there was no Clarity he didn't give any Clarity and they didn't leave with any Clarity and 50 years later people are still getting confused by it because people were trying really in some way to manipulate in some of these ridiculous questions a woman asked the prophet is it all right for a woman to shave her legs that's one of the dumbest questions that I've ever heard in my life and brother Brandon why he just him Halls remember he he was still probably trying to remember the difference between chiffon and rayon these are not things that people talked about I doubt his wife ever said William what do you Bill what do you think about should I shave my legs or not shave I doubt she ever discussed it with him it's a dumb question it's unnecessary it's wrong to put a profit in the middle of something that the Holy Spirit can answer to you for you in your life if you feel convicted of doing it don't do it if the I don't care what the quote said if the spirit of the Lord says to you that is not something that you ought to do don't you do it but if you are my wife and you sleep in the same bed that I sleep in and there's any possibility that my leg might touch yours I want my to be the hairy one these are personal matters you see how the enemy will take everything and try to confuse it women who wanted to wear makeup would ask brother brandham a question and he'd stumble around now when he was under that anointing he said it's Mrs dog meat but when he was B pushed in a question and answer really taken off guard he'd say well I I I I I I just you you you hear for yourself but I I just I if if you know if if a a woman if if she didn't have any color well well I guess it wouldn't hurt to to put a little color if she didn't have fingernails well I I guess it'd be all right for her to get some fingernails the brandom's giving you his humble opinion to tell me that every one of that every bit of that is thus sayith the Lord you're going to have to find somebody else to convince it's people trying to make a point and get him to answer the way that they really wanted him to answer so they could go and do what they wanted to do in the first place that is manipulation that was familiar your spirits operating even back then and the reality is a woman's going to do what she what she can get by with and so is a man come on and if I start telling people if you don't have long fingernails you can go get you some we'll have a church full of witches look at some of them today and and and I got a feeling that when he said if you didn't have color h you could maybe you know get a little I I feel sure he was talking about something that would would would be your flesh color I don't think he was talking about red lipstick and I don't think he was talking about all that thick stuff that people operate in now I don't think that's really what he was saying but you see it should have never been ask in the first place because we have a control tower amen let the Holy Spirit bring some conviction you look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself why you're doing it who you're trying to please who you're trying to attract their attention and what's really going on that you don't feel good about yourself usually the answers are there and here's what he said to summarize it all and this you don't need to forget if you didn't hear anything else I said about these little Holiness issues please hear this one he said this if there's a question about it leave it alone so quote that if you're going to quote the fingernail quote this one too if there's a because some people don't have a question but some people do some people aren't sure and he said if you're not sure leave it alone and I I want to say this in closing if you're not sure if some of your behavior is being influenced by something other than the Holy Spirit and you're wondering if there's a possibility that some of this confusion and disruption and manipulation is because of the manifestation of a spirit you want to seek the Lord sincerely and humbly and you want to ask the Lord how he would have you to proceed in cutting off the INF inuence of that spirit and sending it not only out of your life but out of your family's life come on you don't want to be under the under the control of anything but him Lord here we are we stand in this house today your people a and we are not ashamed to offer you what we are because you you have worked such marvelous works of Grace in our lives yes Lord we sometimes recognize that we got a long way to go but we are so thankful for the journey you have revealed yourself you you have led us one step at a time to God be the glory we know that you have brought us the thus far and you will take us the rest of the way our hope is not in man our confidence is in you our trust is in you our hope is in you lead us by your Holy Spirit if anything else is affecting our Behavior Lord Jesus give us the grace to just just kick that out of the control room of our life not only do we not want to be control from the inside we don't want to be influenced from the outside by anything that is unclean by anything that is not like you by anything that is not really who we are but an outside influence trying to shape us we resist that right now somebody ought to feel that we resist that right now we resist anything trying to manipulate or control us from the outside we resist it in the name of Jesus Christ and we command that thing to flee from us we will shake ourselves and recognize the influence of the enemy in our lives and we will believe that you'll break us out of the box of constraint and you'll break us out of the box of of of being hindered and impeded in the name of Jesus and every Spirit that's trying to get between husbands and wives we take authority over that we call you out and we command you to take your influence and run you have no Authority in The Bride of Jesus Christ we bind together right now as the sons of God and we resist you Lord those of us who have fallen victim to using guilt or other tools to to control we pray God that you would show us today how we can divorce ourselves from that kind of spirit how we can recognize it not in others lives first but in our life first and cut off the very root is is yes Jesus Lord even young people even teenagers using these tricks on their own parents we ask that you would break that thing falling victim to generational iniquity and the spirits of manipulation and distraction we just pray right now that you would even deal with young people young teens maybe even children who have already learned how to yield yield to outside influence to get their way to control a situation I pray Lord in the name of Jesus that you would raise them up today to overcome every bit of that junk I Want You Lord to heal homes heal marriages heal relationships heal siblings relationships yes we recognize that the enemy is working over time to wedge us to divide us families particularly and we pray that your peace God you are not the author of confusion we resist it we reject it and we grab Clarity and purity of thoughts may your word be our guide May the Holy Ghost sit on the control tower of Our Lives break us out from under any form of slackness that we might March forward Lord that we might find as the prophet said our path of Duty may we kick off any distraction that would try to keep us from our path of Duty and run quickly back to your perfect will we pray Lord grant it be ready Grant it granted someone is thinking is it really that easy let me tell you something the hard part is recognizing it the hard part is recognizing it if you can recognize it in your family if you can recognize it in your life that is the hard part behind you the easiest part is to start breaking out somebody said I can't believe that well you can believe it it's absolutely the truth once you become aware that this is not just my personality that I was born with but the enemy is trying to rule my life you can start having better control over your own thoughts because you're putting the right one on the control tower and you some will discover that that you you you were thriving in an unhealthy environment because you were attracted to it but once that attraction is broken you'll start building a healthy environment a real healthy environment which will change your family it'll change your life when we get out from under the unhealthy and start moving in the healthy healthy relationships healthy responses not trying to riddle somebody if you want to tell them something tell them don't riddle them don't give them some kind of riddle and hope they know what you mean speak plainly humbly honestly with love but speak plainly don't try to confuse somebody

this series I don't know when it will be I'm not sure exactly how many more services we have but at the end of it we're going to announ we're going to announce an anointing service and in that service whoever wants to be Anointed with oil and prayed over regarding the these kinds of things we will do it but you're going to have to have a little homework to get to get in the line and that is I want you to spend some time in prayer instead of hoping that I will tell you what the influence is why don't you ask the Lord to begin to talk to your heart oh he will he really will he really will he already is I hope let him talk to your heart and show you some of the things that you feel that that are hindering and that are Spirit involved not just personality Quirk but but a spirit trying to hinder your life your family your relationships and we will anoint with all and we will pray and the Saints will pray and we will believe that you'll find the full Freedom that you need somebody say what do I do in the meantime well you pray and you ask ask the Lord to show you what you need to do for yourselves and what's going on in your life and above all stay in the word and worship him every opportunity you can create a better atmosphere put better music on build a better atmosphere stay in the presence of the Lord as much as you can stay out of complicated situations as much as you can

hearts to him and your hands Lord we're sincere before you we don't want to go on a on some kind of hunt in our life but we want the spirit of the lord we want your Divine Spirit to give us some discernment to help us to recognize what may be going on we want peace in our own lives and we want peace for our families and we want peace in this house we don't want to yield to anything that is not of you so Lord we're believing that when this series is over and we come together for anointing and prayer that many of us are going to walk out of something that has kept us most of our lives and step into into some new freedom and and to and to some new Clarity we're believing Lord that confusion has to cease and and that we will find a a much quicker place to to know your mind and to know your will and sometimes we already know we just keep going in circles trying to reason it out but sometimes we already know what you want us to do Lord give us courage and Grace to do it in the name
