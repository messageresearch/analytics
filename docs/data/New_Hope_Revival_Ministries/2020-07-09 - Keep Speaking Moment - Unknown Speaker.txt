TRANSCRIPT
========================================
because it responded to the voice of the creator withstand him this is not automatic this doesn't come like ripe cherries from a tree withstand means you're gonna have to do something about it you're going to have to stand with some resistance you're going to have to be firm and to be steadfast and you're going to have to make her for mine I'm not going to allow the enemy to occupy my life any longer come on I'm not gonna be eat up and consumed with he did she did we'll never be able to sort all of that kind of stuff out in our life you'll never be able to undo some of the things that have already been done but there is a remedy to let the past be the past there is a remedy to live in the present there is a remedy to press into Christ that's the answer and not allow the enemy to continue to devour your destiny he wants it he's eating he's chewing you listen real close you might hear him chewing this morning wasted days and wasted years and wasted moments and wasted opportunities while the enemy is sitting over there in a corner just heating up our destiny eating up our Y eating up our purpose the reason why we were placed here on the earth and he will always do exactly what he's doing right now until you withstand him you just speak to the mountain you may not see the whole mountain crumble in front of you the moment you speak but you'd be careful not to miss because brother branham told us multiple times and his sermons concerning the authority of speaking to the mountain he said you may not see that one little significant he didn't say insignificant that's what you'd call it that's what I would call it one grain of sand on a big old mountain and one grain moves and you call that significant you know why that gray that one little thing that moved is significant because it responded to the voice of the creator and you know what it means it means that if God can roll one grain of sand off of your Mountain you can roll another and another and another and another and another so what do you do you just keep speaking
