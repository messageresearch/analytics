hallelujah oh oh thank you Lord thank you Lord as we go to prayer today do you have a need by the lifting of the hand all over the house there are needs my hand is up I have needs out across the stream the needs that you have we remember and ask the Lord to minister to those needs believe in the Lord to touch each of your needs I probably won't get all the needs that I am aware of out this morning but could we especially remember the Fisher family today in Greece they are scheduled to leave Greece tonight as a family on a plane to Israel at a very very dangerous time if it doesn't work out at the airport they have to go to the airport and Report they may be told when they're there that the flight is is not available for them then it would be one more week in Greece so we want to lift them up up to the Lord in prayer we've been in touch with them many times over the last few weeks and we know that they are depending on the Lord's leadership and protection it's a it's a fearful thing to think about taking your little babies into a situation that now the Rockets are able to reach anywhere in Israel from the north to the South uh the whole Galilee has been uh just covered in rockets and uh some of these things have have never happened before and so the people are stirred and they need the Lord's protection Lord we heard from uh our good friend Margalit and uh she's hearing the bombs feeling the impact in in her house where she lives near Jerusalem and so we want to pray for everyone in Israel today especially the protection of the Believers we have a very large insurance bill for the church property we pay it every 6 months that's due this week and we don't have anything in the budget for that right now we need the Lord to move he's the provider he can take care of it we're putting it in his hand sister Pam Hendrick excuse me sister Pam Meeks is uh fighting an infection in her jaw and she is looking after the children I can't imagine maybe doing that with an infection in your jaw be quite painful but she's looking after uh I understand Luke and Megan's children while they're away and maybe traveling home today pray for their safety as they come many churches are without power today many services have been cancelled among Believers um and there are people without electricity and there are uh many people without any cell phone coverage there are people that we know of that have never been heard from yet because there's no way to communicate there was a family missing that we were concerned about they were found in aot tell but unable to communicate to tell people we're okay and so we want to continue to pray and ask the Lord to have his way his purpose his will he's a sovereign God Amen the devil didn't send a hurricane right so we're depending on the Lord to take care of his own yes and we believe that he will brother Truman and sister Martha Miller there was a little bit of a hiccup in the in the lender for the buyer and that's to be settled and close on Tuesday so they're going to be a few days late perhaps getting to our area next Saturday hold them up to the Lord in prayer that they will be able to uh have Grace to get through the last few moments of of this transition remember brother Brent who is making a trip back to the west to put things in final order there that God will give him grace and favor and traveling mercies when he returns with all of their belongings I believe Kate's parents are coming for a visit pray for their safety and that the Lord would would uh bless them and give them a good time while they're here there are just so many needs but God is big and he's got them all amen amen let's take them to the Lord touching Jesus is all that really matters let's take these needs to the Lord he's the one that's well able to do something about them oh thank you Jesus touching Jesus is all that really matters and then your life will never be the same there is [Music] only one way to touch him you You Must Believe when you call on brother Hawke will you come and pray today please oh touching Jesus is all that really [Music] matters and then your life will never be the same and there's only one way to touch [Music] him Lord you are a holy God thank you Lord but at the same time you have made a way for us to come before you and that is actually your greatest desire when we come before you in faith we're trusting in the Lord Jesus Christ his atonement his perfect work on our behalf thank you Lord Jesus oh God I pray for the Fisher family that you would protect them that you would lead them and that your perfect plan would unfold for them would you give them peace Jesus Jesus Lord I just live their whole life their Destiny and purpose before you Lord I ask that just what you have planed for them right now that you would lead them and guide them that you would make provision for their lives oh God Lord that anybody body that is fighting something in their body right now I pray that the virtue the healing virtue of Jesus Christ would manifest in their bodies right now every sickness has to leave every depression has to leave any anxiety has to leave there is nothing that can stand against the name of Jesus that life it brings hope it brings deliver it brings healing and Lord uh just everybody that is dealing with uh in the natural lack of electricity or water all the Lord would you just help them would you strengthen them let your perfect plan in all of their lives just unfold and may they look to you for strength and guidance and Lord right now

God has been good to her we appreciate her prayers she and Alfreda agreed together day in and day out while they were together in Edmonton for all of us we were all covered in those prayers and we appreciate that and we want to thank you sister Lydia for your part in that and wish you a very happy birthday God has been good to that family to bless so many of them with long age on Wednesday of this week brother viscal turns 88 years old he's not well but uh he is alive and he has served the body of Christ if you have never had the opportunity to see the video I am a witness it's available on YouTube you would be greatly blessed to hear Brother bis's firsthand eyewitness testimonies of the ministry of brother brandom I know you would be blessed on Thursday of this week uh the Sister Kate Dayne has a birthday and she is alert enough to text God has been very very good to her things are not good but God God is good to her and she continues to give him praise and she wanted you to know she's praying was praying for all of you and we're blessed by that luk yovic has a birthday on Thursday of this week and if you see him Tuesday night be sure to wish him a happy birthday and Joanna Miller will have a birthday and she will be coming as a birthday present she's coming to Alabama so we thank God for that and then Saturday one of the yich children has a birthday Caleb John I call him John Caleb but his name is Caleb John our camp meeting is October the 15 through the 20th and the the theme is that he might have preeminence in all things the Lord woke me up that morning and spoke to me about all the things that take preeminence in our lives and it has to be Jesus and in streaming services sometimes I love to do that I love to hear what God is saying in other places and doing in other places and I hear people uh many times giving preeminence to first one thing and then another sometimes it's brother brandom who receives the the highest preeminence of a service that's not pleasing to God that wouldn't please brother brandom he were alive today sometimes it's all about the cloud that wouldn't please the Lord Lord doesn't wouldn't please brother brandom it's all right to mention these things and to make a to-do about them they're worthy of of a to-do but in all things in all things he has to be glorified and have preeminence I'm waiting for somebody to say amen and that's why when you come in here you're not you're not staring at a picture of of a of of a cloud or of a brother brandom with the angel of the Lord over his head or these things are wonderful things that we celebrate and give God thanks for but when you're in here the word which is Jesus in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God I I read a 50-page article on why that doesn't mean that Jesus was God 50-page article how could Jesus be God and and and uh I he said okay of course people bring in in the beginning was a word the word was with God and the Word was God but that doesn't mean that the son was God and I said to myself you're a scholar but a but a pretty stupid one because you forgot that there's some more verses in John chapter 1 if you'll just drop down a little further in John 1 it says and the word became flesh and dwelt among usen and I'm going to paraphrase by saying and in him we beheld but but in King James it says we beheld the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth so aren't you glad you know that Jesus is the word he was the word made flesh where is the word being made flesh in this hour it's being made flesh in the body of Christ which is his bride the word is becoming flesh again in a body a multi remembered body all over the world we give God praise I want to say that brother gy is a is a faithful servant of the Lord and of this body and uh I I only heard one of the services and I'm very thankful for the quality of preaching that we have we're grateful we're thankful for it I want to say to Ben how how wonderfully blessed I was by the worship and uh it came across the Stream very well and I want to say to those of you who have anything to do with the sound that at least in one of the three services that I streamed the balance of the of the voice and the music was beautiful it was really really well balanced no one no one instrument taking uh any more volume than the other it just sounded like it's supposed to sound in the spirit it's supposed to be everyone blending together and it was it was very nice the drums were not too loud organ not too loud everything just sounded so good and I want to say to Joseph where is Joseph there he is I want to tell you that uh there was an anointing that fell on you in the worship service it might have been might have been Tuesday night I didn't get the preaching Tuesday night but uh but I got the the worship and there was a song that Ben was singing it was either Sunday or Tuesday night one of those songs that has a little bit of Warfare sound to it I don't remember do you remember what it might have been and uh I saw the anointing I could sense it feel it and see it as it fell on Joseph and he began to to play in rhythm with the spirit just right on you know it's one thing to be in rhythm with the music that's good that's a good place to be but you can be you can be accurate in the music and not anointed and that's what brother Brandon was talking about when he mentioned those train choirs it wasn't that you shouldn't practice you should you should exercise the gift that God has given you and and you should work it toward Perfection because you're giving it to the King of Kings and the Lord of lords but he said don't think that by training these voices and all this kind of stuff that it that it uh brings the anointing the anointing is only there when the sincerity of faith is present then that anointing and falls and and young man it fell on you and I was blessed very very blessed we're blessed to have these musicians let's thank God for every one of them so wonderful to see sister Alfreda home and well and looking well and recovering from her uh long trip and uh maybe you don't think about the fact that she is upwards of 80 you know she's on the other side side of 80 and traveled alone and uh had a crazy schedule the intinerary was stressful and straining and she was already not feeling well but the grace of God brought her to us safely and she looks good this morning I know that she probably still needs a touch from the Lord and we've got an air conditioner in the back that needs a touch from the Lord Brother David it needs God's touch and yours it'll be all right with those two on the job I promise you that God is just good he's good he gave us some Divine appointments just take a few more moments of your time before we preach he gave us some Divine appointments along the way he sent us down to we we uh usually stay away from Panama City it's not a place I enjoy being but there was something I wanted to get down that way and uh I've been using the same towels for about 12 years and there's a store down there that uh my wife has changed towels for the main bathroom multiple times but I just like my towel and I've been but you know after 12 years my wife said we need to throw those away and get no no no no no I've gotten to that age in life where I know what I like and I I like what I like and I don't like what I don't like so I'll just use this one until I can get but I found out they had a store down there that that has these towels so we went down and things were already closing up because of the storm we we went in a place for lunch and uh an africanamerican woman was our uh Hostess and she said my daughter is going to be your waitress and she was one of the most attentive waitresses we have had and just very very nice to take care of you and and uh of course I wanted to Tipp her accordingly because we're told to do that and you you can sit there and have this attitude well the boss ought to pay them well you can that may make you feel better better but that doesn't put any anything in their pocket does it and some of them have this agreement where they work on part of their tips and it's a serious thing so I wanted to take good care of her but I discerned that her need was a lot bigger than my tip and so I began to talk to her and she began to talk about her anxiety and that she was very concerned about the storm because she had been there the last hurricane that blew into Panama City and she said when you're looking out the window and you see trees going by your house house she said I have PTSD from it and she said I've been a wreck today and I just began to talk to her I said you know if you change your thoughts you can change your life and I just began to tell her what what the Lord was putting on my heart I tell you she said God sent you I I think God sent you to me today to speak to me she said I have so much more peace than I had when I came in here today and and I trust that God was with that little lady and then right after that or or just before that a man was helping us there on the beach I found out I needed a different chair than the one I took and we rented a chair and an umbrella and it was an older man quite older man who brought it and he was physically fit and in great shape and he began to talk to us and the Lord began to talk to me as he was talking to us and he went away and the family went to do their thing and and he came came back to me and I began to talk to him I said I H you you you you're perhaps you're Jewish and he began to tell me yes he was come to find out he was a Believer he believed that Jesus was the Messiah and he kept coming back to us and uh he finally said you know there's something about your family that keeps drawing me he said I I just wanted to say hello to you speak to you every day something and God sees that when when we went to leave he said uh Steve he said I I want you to send some links to some podcast or something I I I want to hear uh what you have to say may may God do something greater in their life it's not all about fun is it it's it's also about being uh gently led by the Holy Spirit brother fiser was preaching he while I was while he was here brother Scott Smith reached out to me and asked me for brother Fischer's contact information and uh I was wanted to make sure that was okay with brother fiser because he was trying to keep a very low profile but just before they flew to Greece he was able to go there on a Wednesday night and Minister and Sister Evelyn sent me the the service and I was unable to watch it until or to listen to it rather until yesterday as we were driving home but I was so blessed by the ministry that God gave him in that church he was in an entirely different mode than when he was here but it was so so powerful and so wonderful for for the people very plain you know very plain spoken giving his testimony so let's continue to pray for him that God will give them his perfect leadership if God desires for them to be back in Israel uh as of this evening then there's not a bomb anywhere that can hinder the purposes of God's plans do you believe that I hope you do because this is not going to be a popular message this morning but it will be the word of the Lord for us let's stand together and uh give give our attention to the Holy Spirit he's here I want to say that again he's here Genesis 1:1 you know I I think that if you have been gone three Sundays and you come back I think you ought to make up for all the time that's lost amen so today is the day I hope you had breakfast no I don't have any intention of being any extra long we'll be out by 3 I'm sure unless God does something different but I want you to know that I need you in this I I don't want you to aim in what you don't believe but if you hear something you believe I want you to amen it's not just to make the preacher feel good it's not my words anyway it's his but it is because it's vitally important scripturally that we come into alignment with the word and when we hear a truth and we say Amen to a truth the very meaning of the word amen is so be it and it's not just so be it out there it's help me now it so be it in here it is there anybody that wants the word of God to come to pass in them and I I'm one of those I I have to have him I want to have him working in my life that's why we were born that's our why that's the reason why we're here it's our purpose if you think you were born to be cool you're wrong you were born to serve the King of Kings and the Lord of lords if you think you were born to be good-looking you miss the boat you were born to serve God although some of us are a little better looking today than we used to be Jason but anyway moving right along great Improvement we want God to have his way and we want him to speak to our heart Romans chapter 8 uh it will be after Genesis 1:1 so if you're going to catch up you might as well start in the beginning you can't get too much farther in the scripture back than Genesis 1:1 in in the beginning God I just want to say it that way in the beginning God that's it he created the Heaven and the Earth right that's all the atmosphere above the Earth and the Earth he created it all if he created heaven then Heaven is his if he created the earth the earth is his if he created you you're his you belong to him so in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth one more before you you're seated Romans 8 verse 28 and 29 you know this you know these verses very well and we know it's it's not that we speculate or we guess or we hope we know that all means all that's all we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to purpose his purpose I would have made that a capital H if I would have been writing it his purpose not creation's purpose the Creator's purpose let me read that again and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know that means he knew you before he knew you before you were born he knew you before you were created he already knew your strengths I know you're standing he already knew your weaknesses he knew you for whom he did Forno he also did give a prefixed Destiny to predestinate to be conformed you're going to be conformed if he saw you as his before you ever got here you are going to be conformed to the image of his son you're going to be conformed I am going to be conformed to the image of his son I am it's a promise that he might be the firstborn among many brethren yes Jesus was the firstborn among many other Sons God had many more Sons than one amen one of them created one of them begotten and others born spiritually as Sons how many of you are Sons born by the spirit today somebody said I'm a woman I can't be a son of course you can I'm a man and I'm part of the bride of Christ so this is not a gendered thing this is a a predestinated thing it's about election father come now and bring Clarity to your word may may my part in this not be misunderstood may you have preeminence in what is spoken today and we will give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it's in the name above every name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the Saint said amen you may be seated it's 12:25 and we're beginning the the word now sovereignty means to exercise Supreme and independent Authority we have a God who is independent of any other Force there's nothing he he doesn't have to confer with anyone or anything he doesn't have to ask anybody's permission to be God he's God and God alone let the Saints say Amen he's God and God Alone he once existed alone with his thoughts there was nothing to worship Him the prophet tells us that was a time when when really he was he was pre God he was before God meaning only there was no one to worship him so he began to create that which would worship him that which would glorify him and L him as God but he was in essence always God waiting on an opportunity a time a moment in the fullness of his time from eternity he would create first angels and Heavenly hosts that would glorify him and praise him and worship him and eventually Adam who was made both male and female in the beginning and God reached in and pulled the feminis or the female part out of Adam and made for Adam a bride Hallelujah and so uh when all the animals came before Adam to be named they all came with a mate every male animal had a female animal and this is what caused Adam to begin to Long WR in his mind he saw that there's something going on out here in creation Everybody's Got Somebody But Me and there was a longing that was formed in him I'd like to have a counterpart it wasn't that he didn't appreciate the fellowship that he had with God he certainly appreciated that but he longed for some fellowship of a different kind the ability to be able to share one's heart and to hear somebody else's heart he was cre created to have that to long for that and the answer was not found among all the other creatures in fact when it became time for Adam to have that counterpart guess where she was found she was found in him and he reached inside and pulled her out even spiritually you and I were created in Christ when he was created somebody said you mean Christ was created the Bible said he was the beginning of the creation of God he was God but in physical form he was a creation of God there is no Eternal sunship there is sunship but not Eternal sunship there had to be a moment of stepping down of condescending to come in the role as a son but don't misunderstand there are not two Gods we are not tuness there's one and he is as much God as the father was everything that was in Jehovah he poured into Jesus Yeshua the son and everything that was in the sun has been poured out upon the church the bride Church in these last days somebody ought to say amen and God is Sovereign he doesn't need nobody else sister Flo sings that sometime he don't need nobody else if he says it he means it if he says it and means it he's he alone can bring that word to pass now your faith determines whether or not the word is activated in your individual life but that little amen that you put on there or or lack of Amen that doesn't change the word the word is the same whether you say Amen or not but when you say Amen you make the word Universal the word corporate become personalized word you say Amen your faith makes that promise become individualized for you are you here I'm missing some amens I'm thankful that I serve a God who doesn't have to ask the president you doesn't have to confer with the Prime Minister somewhere if he wants to do something he can just do it so sovereignty means to exercise Supreme and independent Authority we're talking today about a sovereign God for us and through us and this is a word from the Lord for this season knowing God's purposes in all things gives great peace if you can know that he's in charge it changes your post right it changes your presence on social media you're not posting in a panic you're posting in faith you're in God's hands I actually got plain enough to say to that little waitress here is the reality if we were in a storm shelter and and and everything was okay it looked okay if if God was ready for one of us come on he would come into that shelter and get us you know it's it's not about where you are it's about who you are and when it's time for you to come home I said when God's ready for you and I to go home we're going home whether we are in the best hospital or the worst hospital we can't blame the doctor when God's Sovereign I hope you don't think your doctor is Sovereign I hope you don't think he get gets the last word how many of you know God gets the last word this is 101 for you folks this is not deep for you this is not some new revelation for you but God for some reason wanted to remind us that he is Sovereign and when we pray through tragedies like what's going on in Israel and when we pray about tragedies like what's going on with with the hurricane and all of the aftermath we need to remember in all of our praying that God is Sovereign you don't want to give the devil any praise for what God did it's an act of God it wasn't the devil doing it oh I better get some water here I knew it'd be a little tough this morning because you all have been you're being overwhelmed with the with the with the sadness of the moment it's horrible it's terrible roads washed away Bridges gone interstates missing whole towns underwater grocery stores gone McDonald's gone how will people live loss of life the most precious thing of all more precious precious than the than the hospital more precious than fast food place more precious than the family home or the lives that were lost God Comfort the family and minister to them but David when faced with such a tragedy as a loss of his son's life he fasted believing that God was able to restore him back to health and to give him longevity but when God decided to take him he didn't blame the devil he didn't get on Facebook and post about how the church is at fault because they weren't praying and the devil got in there and killed his son oh no he got up and washed his face and put on some clean grovee and said I'm going to have my supper now now because the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord is it always easy to do that never easy when you are the one personally facing the loss the grief the shock somebody said well at least it was a long illness that doesn't fix [Music] it they say Well it gives you more time to say goodbye nobody wants to say goodbye I don't know which is worse I don't think we should evaluate it like that death is is awful for us at any time when on a personal level but on a spiritual level when a child of God goes home no matter how how we love them and care for them when a child of God goes home the Bible is true and it says to be absent from the body is to be oh folks Oh Sister Cindy oh everybody that can hear we miss their presence but this is not the same kind of presence that we enjoy on a Sunday morning when the when the Ethereal Spirit of the Lord comes in and begins to blow on us and move on it's oh that's powerful but we're not just talking about something that runs ahead of him his Spirit presence running ahead of him we're talking about something even more real can it get any more real than that it can because what we have experienced through the baptism of the Holy Holy Ghost is only the earnest of what it really means to be occupied by the Holy Ghost it's it's not just having the spirit on your flesh or on your mind will and emotion but it's also having him on the on the control tower of your life it's that Holy Ghost coming from from the inside out instead of the outside in the anointing moves from outside in but the Holy Ghost experience moves from the inside out it's a different Administration but by The Same Spirit we're thankful for that but our loved ones when they leave us they don't just feel as you know they don't just oh this is like feeling good you know they step into eternity oh where everything is more real it's it's more real it's more Vivid it's it it smells better it looks better everything is better when we get into that place and when we re really begin to recognize that we long for that and when lives are lost in tragedies like this we grieve when hostages were just a few moments away from being rescued and out of the hatred and wickedness of of uh of of of serpent seed yes I don't see how a seat of God could possibly take someone's life under those circumstances most likely reprobates would take those hostages lives they're in God's hands not mine I can't be their judge I can just tell you the the likelihood of the situation but took their lives uh one of the most uh physical visible of the hostages uh hsh his family his mom his dad and the media every day at the Republican convention at the Democratic Convention they didn't care about politics they cared about the life of their son and within moments of his freedom so close to being free that the the detection the instruments for sound detection in the tunnels uh monitored by the IDF registered the shots and someone recognized that there was shooting going on in the tunnels just moments before I watched the funeral I saw the pain in a mother and a father even the president of Israel you could see his pain as he spoke to the people and we don't understand things and it hurts us we wept my wife and I wept because we had prayed for his freedom but we have to believe that God saw that we have to believe that there were Souls under the altar crying out oh Lord how long we have to believe that that he died with a testimony of of of be of being Redeemed by by acknowledging the god of Israel though he didn't know the blood of Jesus he he we we look to what the scripture said all Israel shall be saved we have to draw comfort in what the Bible said hoping and believing as his family does that they will see him again regardless of whether or not there's a body to bury on Mount Zion death death is hard and I don't want to I don't want to in any way this morning minimalize the pain that people are going through because of this hurricane I only want to tell you my experience and as I told my son this morning I'm going to or or several of them I think it's not going to be popular this this will get some hits but I I can't help it I've got to tell you what what the Lord said and then you go sort it out for yourself I can tell you this God doesn't Delight in suffering he doesn't get joy out of pain he doesn't sit there like some crazed lunatic you know I got you I zapped you look what I can do you may have found that kind of a villain in your Disney life but our God is not like that he doesn't find theight in anyone's suffering although he allows all things yeses for his purpose all things listen All Things serve God in order to manifest his sons the goal in this life is that there will be Sons manifested in the end of this and yes there are pain there's pain and there's loss and there's suffering and there are innocent people caught up in the swell of some of these things but the ultimate goal of our creator is to manifest sons in the end time the Bible tells us watch this even sin evil and the fall will serve God's purposes till the the end he made a woman such that she would hear and yield being taken from the man as a byproduct but don't think of that as some V Vienna sausage or something we're not talking about a woman being spam you know a bunch of body parts all mixed in and to make some kind of Vienna sausage or something no no no that's not the kind of byproduct she is this was the word that brother brandom used in lack of being able in his time to find a better word it's simply saying that that Adam was the original creation the woman was not the original creation but listen she was to a certain extent because she was in Adam so when God made Adam didn't he also put something in Adam that would be the woman yeah it wasn't the bone by the way it it it was that nature that motherly feminine nature that Adam had he he named them both he named them both Adam he drew them from the earth then he reached in and took that woman and because her not being the original formed but formed from the original it it caused her to have a disposition of being a little more uh a little more you know gullible a little more innocent I want to say this carefully I'm not ashamed to say it I just want to say it with respect to sisters because I thank God I'm not pastoring a church full of eaves I'm pastoring a church full of Marys who said be it unto me according to Thy word I don't think that I should look at you like an eve when you've been redeemed I should see you in the spirit as a Mary who said let God's Will and word be done in me Eve said let me figure this out for myself I'd kind of like to be like God she didn't recognize she didn't have the same Revelation she didn't recognize that she was already like God and if she could have rode the tide she would have been more like him than ever so the very thing she desired she already possessed doesn't that sound like the American Spirit that's right the thing that she desired she already had she just didn't understand it yet right and so because of that because of that predisposition that she came with it was easier for her to accept the Bible said she was the one in the deception Adam was not deceived he did what he did to cover her even as Christ who knew no sin became our sin yes that's right I know this already Pastor do you know it I want you to remember it when things get tough when the power goes out when the highway is not there anymore when the house is gone when the children you don't know where they are you're hoping someone has has uh taken them in when your brand new truck like a friend of ours your brand new truck floats out of the hospital parking lot where you work and you're posting if anybody sees my truck can you imagine anybody sees my truck let me know I hope the payment people will understand this is terrible I'm crooked why didn't somebody tell me not oh no no nobody here did did they H oh he did we never know when the blur is coming from so I got to get it better a little better it's important to breathe when these kinds of things happen it's easy to say look what the devil did the devil hindered the devil got in this but the lord gave me some some pretty specific I I'll get ahead of myself to to share it now but he gave me some specific thoughts and and I I just will will share a portion of them with you and and uh one of the most important things was he dealt with me that if anyone in my presence should attribute the storm as the work of the devil that I should speak up and tell them no no this one is all mine the Lord said this one is all M could that not almost be said about every but but he said specifically to my heart this one is all mine when when God takes responsibility come on it means that his will and his purpose is going to be accomplished in the end in the end men and women are going to see that it's not the loss of the new truck or even the the half of the house that really matters what matters is knowing your creator with a personal intimate relationship having a real genuine Walk With Jesus Christ he gets us through the loss he gets us through the stuff he replaces what we lose so many times people out of the generosity of their hearts will reach out to help those that have lost the only thing that can't be restored is a life that is lost but even in death God is screaming to a community he's screaming to a nation yes he is you want to know one of the things he's saying keep your mouth and your hands off of My People Israel you'd better be careful what you say and how you treat them it's one of the things he's screaming there's message churches who don't ever ever ever take a moment to mention the importance of Israel and the importance of the Jewish people to encourage their congregations to pray for the Peace of Jerusalem the prophet told us watch sir watch watch Israel watch Jerusalem he says specifically for they are the time piece of God if you want to know what God is doing he said watch Israel if you want to know what's going on people say look at the newspaper but he said I want you to know if you want to know what God is doing you watch Israel you watch Jerusalem you watch the Jewish people it's it's uncanny if you start looking at the facts according to Noah the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration the US sustained 28 weather or climate disasters since between 1980 and 2017 the estimate damage for each of those disasters that's named and numbered is about a billion dollars the total cost of these 208 events weather related atmospheric related events cost this nation 1.1 trillion dollar this data only goes to 2017 to update it would take us perhaps to $3 trillion dollar or more our nation has had to pay in repairing uh infrastructure for weather related damages what do you want to say to that I want to say this in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth since this idea we will give land for peace I was there when the withdrawal from Gaza took place I have told you multip Le times how s sad and sorrowful it was to see those people being drugg out of their homes by their own families police served their Nation pulling their own Brothers their own cousins out of their homes dragging them I saw it dragging them across the yard because they refused to give up their land but Washington said Washington convinced the knesset that the only way we'll stand with you is if you make every effort for peace and the only Road mapap forward would be to give up land listen if it was your yard and you gave it to me to keep us from having a Hatfield and McCoy situation that's one thing as long as that was really your yard if you gave me a foot off of the side of your property deeded it to me because you wanted to keep peace between neighbors that's one thing because that would be you giving up something that you owned that you held the deed to but listen the bureaucrats didn't own the land of Israel not the knesset not the Senate not the president not the United Nations they don't own the title deed to that land it's not given to the government of Israel that land is given to the Jews as an inheritance it's older than the balfor Declaration it's older than the United Nations uh you know declaration that that Israel shall be the homeland of the Jews it goes all the way back to a promise that God made to Abraham and he didn't say I'm going to give it to your concent member or I'm going to give it to your prime minister he said I'm going to give your seed an eternal inheritance in that land but men wise men decided not just Democrats it was Bush wise men decided that we'll give land for Peace So they pull out and the first thing the Palestinian people started doing was destroying the infrastructure they destroyed their future they burned their homes they burned they desecrated the graves of the Jews they dug up Toros Scrolls that had been uh given a a a solemn burial as they do they dug them up and set fire to them they destroyed green houses and farms and Orchards and millions of olive trees because they didn't want to swallow a Jewish Olive is there anybody that eats a pizza and wonders whether or not it has a Jewish Olive on it anybody in here and they don't mind to steal Jewish olives and Jewish grapes in the shomron in Samaria and when they get all they want off of them there in what the word World likes to call the West Bank they burn the trees they'll pick the grapes steal the grapes and burn the vines somebody said what are you talk you know I didn't know we were going to get racial here this has nothing to do with race it's a Biblical thing that's been unfolding I'm not going to preach on Israel but sure sounds like it it's been unfolding all of these years it it it really is it's that wild nature of ishmail right he mocked Isaac the real son Ishmael was given some inheritance but it was never enough and he had he inherited a wild nature as God said he would and it's a wild man that digs up carrots out of the ground and sets them a fire instead of eating them I mean if you don't like carrots I get it but surely there's somebody in your family that likes carrots right and you don't destroy the green houses and you don't destroy the seed that are going to give you more carrots for next year but their hatred you don't understand their hatred for the Jewish people is so severe that they want to do everything they can not only to murder them and wipe them off but as long as they have to live near them they want to spite them in every possible way that they can and that's the whole situation and America has tried to to be involved and they're all out of sort because no one called and asked their permission to take out one of the deadliest men that has ever lived and nobody called Biden who wouldn't have known he was being called in the first place excuse me President Biden he didn't know he missed the call no one called to say is it okay with you if we take out nazala we have an opportunity to take him out one of the deadliest men that has he is the deadliest man that's ever served holah but one of the deadliest terrorists in all the world thousands of men and women including Americans have died because of the plans that were hatched and executed by nazala and Israel said there's no there's no turning back now we cannot turn back folks why is that so hard for for Americans to understand you can't start something and then just back out and say you've got to finish this thing and God is saying to America do you want another Katrina do you want another Katrina do you want another one of these uh 208 weather an atmospheric events listen I didn't finish since the land for peace efforts began in Madrid Spain in the month of October 1991 there have been 1751 billion events that's $175 billion most of these catastroph C excuse me most of these catastrophes occurred while the United States was pressuring is Israel to once again divide the Covenant land the the uh the similarity there's no way there's no way that these are 208 coincidences the odds would never let it be 208 coincidences if you want to read about any of this you can read it in in a book called eye to eye facing the consequence of dividing Israel by William kig some of you know that name because he's been reporting on things going on in Israel for a long time to my knowledge there has not been an update of those figures or those events since 2017 so the last edition of his book that I have access to is from 2017 but he did the math he not only did the math he broke these catastrophes down and told what was going on politically at that time and what was being said and who was saying it and why God had to get involved he is Sovereign you can't tell God what to do about his land or his people and the price that America is willing to pay for peace is not necessarily the price that God is willing to pay that's right and if anybody ought to be an expert on peace it's him he is SAR shalom he is the Prince of Peace somebody said how is this going to affect us I want you to know this is how and many more ways than what we will talk about today it was Appalachia now this time the spirit of the Lord spoke to my heart standing on the beach and he said this hurricane will cleanse the land like many that have come before it he said I'm erasing a blood curse across the regions that this storm will touch I'm dealing with something a blood curse it's connected to Witchcraft and I'm going to be dealing with that In This Storm and as of yet no one knew exactly where it was going to go and as a family we're sitting around in a living room that we've become familiar with because as often as we can we get the same house it's not on the beach it's much more affordable because it's off the beach but it's walking distance and we know what's there and and somebody stole the toaster so we had to get them to bring us the toaster but we make a list of what's there and we know what's there and they're going to sell the house that we uh have enjoyed and unfortunately not to us the real estate man said why don't you just buy it and I said oh yes I'll write a check this afternoon God said I'm doing some things we didn't know we sat around in the living room as a family and made the decision we were scheduled to leave on Friday morning but we we knew when we left that they would offer us uh Friday night at a discount and so our plans were to come home Saturday but now this thing is getting closer and closer and if you think your coverage was off the chain you should have been there on the coast you should have heard the things they were saying oh my goodness they were leaving very uh little possibility of of survival and I'm not exaggerating and they have to do that CUA you've got some hard-headed old folks live in Florida and so they got to make it sound you know like Armageddon and and I can't tell you that don't get under your skin just a little bit and and they said you know this thing could come it it certainly could come right up through uh the destined area and uh it has before and it can again in Panama City is only 30 miles 30 minutes from where we were in Panama City has had some devastating ones in fact you all will remember that one of the West sons was missing and they they found him safe but Panama City has been hit so hard in the past so we realize that we were uh in a place but we just kept s sing and praying and believing that God had a purpose and as a family we decided to put ourselves in God's hands and just see just waited out and see what to do and that he would lead us and God began to talk and I was actually standing on the balcony of our house everyone else had gone to bed I was standing on the balcony of our house just after the storm had made landfall in a light drizzle with only a little bit of Gusty wins and it was in that moment that the Lord said don't let anybody give the devil this one this one is mine and it is going to accomplish my purpose and my plan God wants us to know that as a nation we better take our hands off of Israel God wants us to know as a as a a body of Believers we better wake up in fact the the very thing that the Lord spoke to my heart standing there on the balcony was found in Romans chapter 13 and I want to read that to you in a moment but uh let me give you Romans uh 13 and uh verse 11 and 12 can you do that I know that it's I'm giving it to you out of order but let me just read those 11 and 12 and that knowing that's Amplified can we go back just before that to King James and that knowing the time that now this is what I heard him say it is high time this was to the church this was to the churches in the region it's to us but it was to the churches in the region that would be touched by the storm and that can be from Florida all the way up to wherever it finally makes its last dump because no one really saw it flooding Asheville and going up and taking out part of the interstate between uh Gatlinburg and Asheville the interstate bridge is gone but God said I'm talking I'm talking and here's what I'm saying knowing the time that now it is high time to wake out of sleep I'm talking to the churches in that Reg I'm talking to the churches in this nation I'm talking to this church the Lord is saying I'm talking to you it is high time to awake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer yes sir than what we believed there's no time left for playing around not for churches in the region affected not for this church not for any Bible believing church not for any Bible believing Christian if you're not reading your Bible every day something is wrong it's going to get quiet brother bandham said I believe that a Christian should read their Bible two to three times every day I I expect it to be quiet because there's very few of us that can say that we do does reading it on our phone count it does but only reading it as someone's post on social media on that doesn't really count because you're not really really focused on that your thumb is already ready there are people among us sitting right here this morning it's going to get quiet here now there are people sitting right here Among Us that would actually scroll up if they saw a reference if they thought they were going to have to read a verse of scripture not that they hate the scripture they just don't love it come on it's not that you hate it it's just you don't love it you've just not been in love with the word in a long time just a tell us brother you just haven't loved the word like we need to love the word and now is our opportunity to do that I don't believe that it has to be a leatherbound Bible I believe you can read it electronically but read it and I will tell you that that reading it in a in a in a bit in a real book a real codex a real uh you know sewn together thing paper and ink you are less distracted because there are no other notifications popping up no weather notifications no credit card bills due notification no cash app notification come on and somebody said I can't be away from my phone that long yes you can yes you can yes you can yes you can sir it's high time Florida Georgia Alabama South Carolina North Carolina Tennessee Virginia and wherever Kentucky and wherever else it's high time God said I'll use this to cleanse some of the curse that blood has brought the shedding of innocent blood has brought on the land I I'll use this rain as a symbol of pushing some things out that need to be pushed out but in the process of this my people better wake up my people better come to the awareness that that our Salvation hallelujah our Redemption is nearer than what we have first believed we are closer to that moment than we have ever been before it's time to wake up it's time to get out of our sleep it's time to recognize our Salvation is nearer than what we believe the night is are spent the day is at hand let us hear us let us therefore cast off I just don't find myself visiting some of the things I used to visit I I just find my interest is Shifting and I'm not being pulled in that direction nearly as much listen folks this is not gradually getting over Darkness this is making up your mind to be extreme if you think Jesus wasn't extreme he said if you can't keep your eye where it ought to be pluck it out I'm not suggesting that anyone blind themselves I'm not suggesting that anyone do themselves bodily harm I'm just telling you what Jesus said if your right arm offends you cut it off you know what he's saying he's saying quit making your silly little excuses about how busy you are it's your soul it's your eternity that is at stake you you you mean to tell me there's anything more important than watching for your own life life and watching for your children's life we're we're beckering over things that don't matter and fretting over things that don't matter and saying we believe in a sovereign God and then blaming the devil for everything bad that comes our way we're confused we're just confused the Bible said a double-minded man don't you be the man that kicks the television out and then you know after a while you bring it back in if you make up your mind to get rid of that thing get rid of it and don't ever ever ever ever take it back if you can't do that put a blanket over it that doesn't help you you're going to have to make up your mind listen there there are people who shouldn't sleep on a property where there is one because they're so addicted to it there are people that shouldn't have access to the internet at all because they're so addicted to the bad things I Don't Preach like this often you say are aren't you preaching to the bride yes I'm I'm talking to all of us I'm talking to all of us but I'm just saying be careful be careful you can have sympathy we've got to pray for folks that are in trouble but let me tell you something don't you dare say that Satan sent this storm don't you dare say that the devil is doing this to distract us from the things of God don't you dare say some religious jargon like that because God said I create in the beginning God created the Heaven and the earth oh it gets bigger than that it gets bigger than that I'm all over the place sovereignty means to exercise Supreme and independent Authority he is going to have sons to fellowship with throughout all eternity and he's going to bring them forth in this hour and he's going to squeeze them out we're coming out of this thing by being squeezed out of it your Comforts are going to be challenged [Music] before this thing is over you may have to fill your tub with water in preparation for not having water through a storm come on they were telling people to the beach don't throw any empty water bottles away save all your water bottles this week fill them all up put them on the counter you'll need them to wash your hands you'll need them to flush your toilets fill every bucket fill every Bowl yes right come on we stopped in Target later Walmart for so that every member of the family could have a uh supplemental charge you know what I mean a a power bank little Gadget that you charge up and it will extend the life of your battery you plug it in it'll charge up your devices how many of you are with me sorry it took me so long to describe it to you there weren't any to have because people don't have landlines anymore and so they knew that if they lost power they would lose access to the outside world people are safe and they have no way to tell their families they're safe because they don't listen oh we dodged the bullet I want you to know something you better shut your mouth dodg the bullet nothing The Sovereign Grace of God said I'm going to in this situation going to accomplish my will and my plan and my purposes I'm going to put this where I want it to be in this hour I'm not going to forget those that are mine they may lose they may go through some difficulty I have friends that are are being greatly inconvenience some are medically challenged and need help and there I don't want you to think I know someone is going to see this and you're going to think I'm heartless and callous and I have no compassion and that I don't pray for those who are suffering and I don't care because it hasn't affected me nothing could be any further from the truth I'm only telling you what I truly believe the Lord has spoken to me in this don't say you dodged a bullet this one is mine I'm in this one somebody said is that even biblical naom said it was naom said he's the god of the Whirlwind God's in it and you need not think that that you're you know the some of these uh uh crazy charismatic types you know bobbed haired women that dye their hair pink and purple and yellow and all these silly colors God don't do that God Don't Make freaks like that that's what you did because you wanted to be that way God don't make people you don't see babies coming out of the womb with purple hair I'm just going to tell you like it is this morning wake your neighbor up you don't see God don't birth babies like that it's a spirit of the age women aren't born with spiders on their eyelashes you you're not born with pink uh fingernails and red toenails and and and ruby red lips and you find those things in pornography but you don't find them among God's people it's a spirit of this age that has influenced the church and if you don't think it's present in message circles all you have to do is just post one little quote about a Christmas tree and you'll find there are more Pharisees around this message and in the Assemblies of God don't talk about denominations we've got some right around this message yes sir who will stand on it if it suits their lifestyle but if it know no longer suits their grandchildren or great grand or children then they'll give them a Christmas tree buy them dresses above the knee put little girls in britches because they're too young to know the difference and all the kinds of things we see happening around the message of the hour God saying I'm going to talk in this you better listen I'm going to talk I'm going to talk to those who lose loved ones I'm going to talk to those who lose power I'm going to talk to churches that can't meet together and worship this morning I'm going to talk to you I'm not judging you I'm not condemning you God just saying I want to talk to you I just want you to listen to me I just want you to know that that at any moment I can have your freezer at any moment I can have your pantry I can show you what Ramen noodles are I'm the one that puts the steak in the freezer God is saying I'm the one that puts a chicken leg on your table you worship me you praise me you weren't born here this is God now I'm not say you know what I'm saying it's by his hand it's by his grace we're fed by his grace we're clothed by his grace he's Sovereign I gotta close god listen what what he's going to have sons to fellowship with throughout all eternity toward this purpose he's going to make all things work together for good do you believe that all things somebody say all things and we know and we know and we know and we know and we know and we know that all things I bought a lemon all things I bought a dog and it died all things RI the zipper out of my jeans all things got a hole in my shoe all things can't charge my phone all got a swamp in my backyard all things I'm talking to you God's saying I'm I want you to know that I am Sovereign and I am above it all and you you know these women like I was talking about just a moment ago purple green yellow hair whatever they are get them a stick and shake it at the storm and think there's some kind of prophet like Moses or something and command the storm to go this way and that way and the other way and carrying on all this foolishness and the conference world is all behind that out there you know what they call a Revival is a mess and they're running here and there commanding storms and telling godod to fall and all the kinds of things they get in their head and God said don't you know I don't don't really need you to tell me what to do in my business I don't need you to tell me where the storm ought to go I don't need you to tell me what direction it needs to go in let me tell you something the church is not walking in that kind of authority anyway the bride is growing up into that kind of authority and even with that Authority you got to be careful because you can talk something right out of its hour right out of its season you the best thing that we can pray when we don't know what to pray and if the Holy Ghost won't talk through us in prayer with groanings that cannot be uttered or understood then what we need to say is as it is in heaven as it is in heaven in Earth even as it is in heaven in Earth even as it is in heaven yes God must be omnipotent someone say omnipotent he is omnipotent all powerful over all things to make this statement let me ask you a question what does all leave out what are the are you still here what are the exceptions to all does all mean all that's all if God is omnipotent if he has all power he must also be omniscient because in order to have all power you've got to be all knowing if there's anything God doesn't know he chose not to know it that's right everything else is in his hand it's in his mind he knows it he must be omniscient all knowing in order to make such all-encompassing statements in his word that's right let's look at a quote or two here for just a moment are you with me praise God good glory be to God no I didn't fall I'm okay okay provide some details I did not fall all is well okay praise God in a message called uh the infallible proof of the Resurrection he said now the devil has fought after he seen that he thought he destroyed that righteous seat at Calvary and let's stand by just a moment and watch something take place what a display could you ever imagine the omnipotent omnipresent omniscient infinite God what he might have been a Kentucky Gentleman but he knew how to spit this out could you ever imagine the omnipotent omnipresent omniscient infinite God ever letting the devil defeat his purpose why the devil just stir up that old storm to ruin my vacation the thought never crossed my mind and if it ever crosses your mind it's a distraction it's a lie just rebuke it and send it on its way everything that causes you a little difficulty the devil may not be guilty of sending at all right what God doesn't instigate he often times allows come on and there they go there they go I rebuke you devil I take authority over you devil I command you devil take your hands off of my vacation take your hands off of my County oh God I I command the de blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah God said could you ever imagine him the prophet could you ever imagine the omnipotent omnipresent omniscient infinite God ever letting the devil defeat his purpose read it no not God read the last would you he will when will he do it he will never do it he'll never let the devil defeat his purposes he is omnipotent omnipresent omniscient and infinite he will never let the devil he will never let the devil he will never let the devil defeat his purpose Hallelujah the purposes of God are going to be fulfilled in this election all those religious people that say then we don't have to vote that's wrong that's not what this thing is about we are always told in every situation to do our part prayer is always right it's always right to talk to God about it and if you if you know that something's coming that's God and you don't like it you're human and so what you say is you come in into prayer and you say Lord I might not necessarily like what's coming down the river now I I I I I may not be real but I want you to help me not to get in your ways he's a sovereign God for us and through us oh God I don't want to get in your way so help me I'm going to pray what I know is right I'm going to vote what I know is right I'm going to do what I know is right but in the end I'm going to praise you the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord I think the worst thing that seemingly could happened to this nation in November is that this one who ride at the broom in folklore I wouldn't trust a thing that comes out of her forked tongue I don't trust everything I hear former president Trump say either you you need to know the balance he's not my savior and he is far from a righteous man but you don't have to be righteous to be used of God the Bible tells us so there's at least seven examples in the Bible where God used wicked men to accomplish his [Music] purposes that's the balance that's a balance he's not holy no somebody said he's a convicted felon many of our presidents were by the way right it's not a new thing and just because you've got somebody 12 somebodies or or 24 somebodies or 36 somebodies who say you're guilty only at the end of the day the victim in you you know you know and I want you to know just because somebody swear something doesn't mean it's the truth there are a lot of people serving time and serving in prison because of what is called repressed memories that are really lies of Satan the thing never happened it never even really happened but you know there are certain psychologists and psychiatrist and whatever they might be who who have a way of I've watched it done leading people into some kind of imagery where you start forming a picture in your mind and call it a a a supr ressed or repressed memory and and and uh it's horrible it's terrible what has happened in in families it has destroyed families it has broken homes it has destroyed lives the poor victim who's really only a victim to an evil memory that Satan has tried to use to confuse and destroy their life they're the ones losing and I pray I pray often for for folks in that situation because we were actually faced with a situation like that some years ago not in this church but something was being told that that was supposed to have happened in another church and the Lord just said that's not how it was it that is not what happened that is not how it happened and it's time to be honest and it's time to tell the truth it's time to come clean and if you're not willing to do that it's not easy especially if you've sworn a lie and so you get into all the the moral implications of a a former president Trump you look at all the thing why you may be just as turned off by him as you are her and I wouldn't blame you if you were but here's the deal God's going to have a plan you pray what your heart leads you to pray you stand for what your heart leads you to stand for you you are an americ American and by that right you have a right to vote and they're fighting to give illegal immigrants the right to to draw Social Security uh checks and eventually even to vote I if if they have the right you certainly have the right and should have the right well brother bam told us to not have anything to do that I know he did and yet he voted for Nixon yes he said so so here's the thing it's like scripture you have to take it all you can't take it out of context you can't take one quote where brother brandom said don't have anything to do with that politics and stand on that when you've got a quote over here where he says well I voted for Nixon you take it off so so what do you so so what's the balance to that let the Lord lead your heart let your heart be led by the spirit of God but I just don't feel like we have the right to complain and belly ache and Grumble and gripe about the outcome of something if we don't at least do our tiny little part I'm just being honest but God is Sovereign it doesn't matter who gets there their heart's going to be in the hand of the king the Bible said the Bible said he turns the heart of the king he puts up Kings he pulls down Kings look how many have tried to get rid of uh uh prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu 40 years for 40 years they've tried to stamp out his voice I don't think he's a 100% righteous man I think he's also made mistakes but he acknowledges those mistakes and he he gives credit and Glory to almighty God and it doesn't matter what anybody thinks about him anyway it doesn't even matter what his wife thinks about him it doesn't matter what what Israel thinks about him for such a time as this come on for 40 long years because even before he was the Prime Minister of Israel he was standing up in the United Nations for Israel just like he did this week and if you didn't hear the speech that he gave 20 minutes before nazala was taken out in Lebanon yes on if you didn't hear that speech you'd know you if you heard it you knew you were hearing a lion roar you don't have to get involved in the politics of the moment but you would know that you're hearing a lion roar and you would know why the enemy has tried but it doesn't do him any good because he just keeps going in one of these days he won't be there anymore he'll either die or or the Lord God will allow someone else to take his place and they may try to end him in a scandal and they may try it won't matter his work will be finished for such a time as this for such a time as this for such a time as this he's Sovereign when he looked at his family in the Garden of Eden when little Adam and Eve her lovely little head laying on Adam's shoulder as he moved through the garden and if the winds blowed and little Eve said oh Adam said peace be still and the wind stopped and the lion and the tiger followed them oh Hallelujah they were like kittens by the way if this is your little calico cat that's running around the church would you please collect him take him to your house I don't intend to have a cat at my feet coming in my office door so if he belongs to you pleas please put him in a box a leash take him home with you put him in your purse make a thousand post on Facebook about how cute cats are but get him off this property keep him if you live on the property keep him in your yard buy a fence I am not going to have a cat brushing up against me coming in to preach the gospel no extra charge for that they carry spirits but so do people and we can't get rid of them they were like little kittens and in the evening when the sun was going down and they went to the cathedral under the palm trees or whatever trees it was in Eden they began to worship a soft mellow light God the logos come down over the top of the trees he said children have you enjoyed yourselves today on the earth I have come down to kiss you good night and to lay them down at sleep and he laid all of his animals down to rest through the night the father said that's good I like the way it's done do you think that the heavenly father will be defeated in his purpose even though Satan has done what he's done it's an impossibility hello hello hello it's an impossibility he will not be defeated and he's given us a perfect assurance and that's not afflac he's given us a perfect assurance that we will not have to be you don't have to be scared of anything somebody said shouldn't we exercise wisdom of course we should but you're not likely to need all 50 of those guns in one particular situation one will probably get the job done if it's big enough to do the job and quite frankly some people just probably ought not to own them anyway I'm not for gun control I am for some common sense if you don't know how to properly use it you might kill yourself instead of the one that's trying to kill you little wisdom goes a long way and aren't we blessed to know that we have Holy Ghost you don't have to be scared of anything is anybody with me 10 more minutes and we shall see the scriptures Proclaim that God has Sovereign control over all things that have that have anything to do with your life he never falls off the throne and we shall see he never shares the throne with the Devil devil huh The Authority that the devil has is according to God's designs and laws brother brandom tells us that doesn't he the only Power the devil has is what you give him he can be Mighty powerful in the life of somebody that keeps surrendering authority to him and if you're busy blaming God blaming the devil for what God does in the message Rapture the last the last uh message in in the west if God is infinite Almighty all powerful om omnipresent omniscient why why he know all things what part of all does all leave out all of it no no no all means all that's all he knowed all things from the beginning so he knowed he knew there's nothing out of cater it's just as he thinks it's just excuse me it's just us that thinks it is it's everything it's everything run look back in his word and see what he's doing then we'll have an understanding God give us an understanding are you telling me that it was God's will to flood a valley and destroy a hospital hpit and leave people on the top of the hospital praying for a helicopter to get out it was and had it not been God's will I know there was at least one Holy Ghost message believer on that roof yes sir and I have a friend who I would consider to be a nominal Christian who was on that roof there were only 60 what 65 people up there something like that so I know at least two of the people and if I had a list of their names because of the area that it's in I might have known more people that were standing on top of that roof and because there was one Bible believer one who believed the whole message of the hour I want you to know the devil couldn't have drowned that woman had he tried to the the helicopters tried to come and the and the wind wouldn't let the helicopters land they had to stay there longer and uh somebody said from from the from who was there they were reading the Bible and praying and giving God praise you say well so were the one standing on the deck of the Titanic but I want you to know it was God Who let that thing go he said you you're getting too big for your britches sometime you mean that would be God's will yes because in that instance he was going to swoop in and say to all involved Fox News picked it up it was carried all over the world here's this bunch of folks standing on the top of the hospital calling on the name of the Lord and God glorified in that God doesn't get Glory if the devil's the one doing it God is Sovereign he doesn't want to see people suffer but he's got a message he's still talking he's telling churches wake up he's telling New Hope Revival Min wake up the night is far spent the day is at a hand our Salvation is nearer than what we have believed If he if he is an infinite who is this mzc if he is an infinite he isn't God infinite means having all power he isn't God how can you have all power and the devil have some of it God has to be infinite we are finite he is infinite and he was omnipresent omniscient and omnipotent if he isn't if he isn't somebody read the rest would you please there's no margin here to to play with If he if he's not all those things he's not God he he didn't even have somebody say all he had to do is speak to the storm folks the creator doesn't have to talk if he don't want to talk that's right all he would have had to do just wi it so he allowed it because he's sending a message there's some stuff that's got to be dealt with and one of the things that's got to be dealt with is the church the believer has got to stand up for Israel's right to possess the land because it's not a political right it's a god-given right no black person should be hated because of the color of their skin no muslim Arab should be hated because of the color of their skin no Jew should be hated because he was a Jew no Caucasian should be hated because they're Caucasian there's no racism involved in this whatsoever it's you bless what God bless you curse what God curse and if you don't get ready to be cursed that's because that's what the word said he's omnipotent he's omnipresent omnicient omnipotent he isn't he isn't God knows all things all places because he's omnipresent omniscient makes him omn omnipresent he is being he's not like the wind he's a being he's a spirit he dwells in a house but being omniscient knowing all things makes him omnipresent because he knows everything that's going on he can be everywhere anywhere and everywhere because God is a spirit right that can't that I remember this he said there can't be a flea bad its eyes but what he knowed every blink on the eye of a flea God knows it do you think he lost a storm you think he didn't know what to do with Helen do you think Helen careful he careful I heard people say we ought to put another l in that and make it from hell you can spell it any way you want to and say anything you want to say but the reality is he is omnipresent he is omniscient he is omnipotent he is infinite he is almighty God if he would wanted to take out the Eagles Refuge Campground he could he would if he wants to in the future he will if he wanted to take your roof he would have somebody said I just don't believe this kind of it doesn't matter what you believe matters is what the word said you can't have it both ways I refuse to call myself a servant of a God who is less powerful than what he created he created the devil the Bible said he created evil for his purpose the Bible said he didn't just make light he made the darkness too and he uses it to turn people toward the light God uses Darkness to turn people toward the light he allows evil to turn people toward that which is right he harnesses your problems your trials and uses them to bring you closer to him yes there's not a flea that bats his eye I'm closing now rather shortly there's not a flea that bats his eye but what he knowed and he knowed before there was a world how many times B oh oh if that thing just if that thing just goes off a little to the west or if it goes off a little to the east or God Did It God's in it the reason why one of the things that helps me to know that people don't know they don't even know what God's capable of is all these people said we didn't expect it to come to our area no one told us it was coming to our area nobody warned us nobody saw this somebody did I know this sounds too cut and dry but I knew if I didn't bring it cut and dry you wouldn't hear it you're not really used to a lot of sugar coating anyway you may not have known it but God did from the beginning and let me tell you something when he gets in a storm woo when the real storm you know Wrangler gets in he just rods it wherever it needs to go somebody said yeah but everything's flooded let me tell you something there's a great big God sitting on top of that flood ain't that what the word [Music] said when the enemy comes in like a flood yes God raises up a standard against him isn't that what the scripture said God's on top of it if he didn't instigate it he wrote it in yeah didn't catch him by surprise one more this happens to be from the church ages the exposition of the church ages the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his abilities so therefore he is as God must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient if he is omniscient he is not now learning ain't that powerful the best we could say is that sometime he will be but that is not scriptural he is omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God Stacy walks into the room last night and she said we ought to pray she said we ought to pray because she said Heather and Dwayne are without power and the parents without power and uh Dwayne is on a CPAP machine and he can't sleep without it and uh and and uh the the business is the Shop's okay it's up up on the hill but between here and can't get to it and and so many things like that and it oh it just gets me I I feel so terrible for people that I love not to have power and they've just got a message that said it could be up to a month that's what she came in and told us and I said the reality is this was the words that came out of my mouth the reality is God is Sovereign and he gets the last sa how how many minutes was it honey not even 10 minutes she calls back on the broken signal and Stacey's trying to make out what she saiding and she saiding you all won't believe this the power just came [Music] on God did that for them their supper looked better than mine they cooked on the grill made cornbread on the grill my children brought me a quesadilla from Taco Bell and if anybody's ever had that you know that ain't food and Dwayne and Heather of there eating cornbread made on the grill but their life was affected their children were affected their church was affected and I understand that and it makes makes me feel terrible that they had to go through it but let me tell you something the Devil comes back and says it'll be a month and God said you don't understand I've got some children over here in Goan and I will decide I will I'm not going to put more on them than they're able to bear I'm not going to give my servant more than one or two nights without good rest I know how to turn there is a man in here that can turn on the lights so nobody had to ring their hands because God is Sovereign and he'll take care of his anybody with me I'm closing I've already said that but I'm going to finish this quote he's omniscient never had a new thought about anything all of his thoughts he's always had musicians are coming and always will have and knows the in from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal they are real they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he's drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form they oh my listen listen listen listen to the difference between my thoughts and your thoughts and God's thoughts I may have a thought and a plan and I may draw it out like brother gley Drew out the fellowship hall drew it out on the paper and showed it to me me that was his plan and in that original thought process because even though his faith is huge and he knows what God can do he didn't want to put an extra burden on this body and the original thought was we'll just for now for very temporary time we'll just leave the floor gravel then you start thinking about the fact that we have Elder people like [Music] me who sometimes stumble around with their feet sometimes I misstep my right leg is a little weaker than the left leg because of surgery and and and and I'm a little bit like a wobble I've got a lot here around the middle and sometime I can lose my balance and there are others that have more serious problems than I do and we don't want to pick people bloodied up off the floor and if God said I you know this is a way to have fellowship and and brother gedy could draw it up and put the walls in and the door in and everything else and then God had a bigger plan he had a bigger plan he had a bigger plan no one was trying to unell you know brother gy you know him you know that in no way but he didn't want to come up here and say we got to have a conqu you know this was just a why he didn't even know what my reaction would be I was already uh at one point wondering what are we going to do I feel like that God is changing the direction of that building but I didn't know what it was all about but God did he knew how to put that in his somehow the Lord had different thoughts you can have a thought you can draw it up but your thoughts are just that thoughts but look what he says one day will uh like a man they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up in which one day will be translated into substance and form what a thought what a thought but they are already they are real and eternal and part of God thank you have you ever changed your mind about a thought you had God hasn't his thoughts are already Eternal they're already real they're already in substance somebody said wait a minute wait a minute wasn't there a Prophet that that prayed and changed the mind of God and if that happened like that in the old test didn't God have to say wait a minute I'm going to change oh no folks let's go back first further than that when God put Eve in Adam before he ever pulled her out he knew she would be the one before Judas was ever given the job of being the treasurer for the Lord's holy band God already knew he'd be the one that would sell him out are you with me God knew what Adam would do because he put in Adam the heart of a redeemer yes God knew God knew God knew God knew God knew the church at large would not receive the message to prepare the bride God knew that even in the last of the last days there would be those who would rise up to try to discredit the message that God sent to prepare the bride God knew God knew it he knew it he knew who would fall off he knew what they would say he knew the accusations they would make oh yes and at the end of their research they may find that the servant of the Lord was not infallible but they will certainly find out that the God who sent him was if you don't already know it I'm quite sure you do your pastor is very very much fallible not at all infallible but the God who sent [Music] him is fallible he is infallible he has does not have the ability to fail cannot fail so God what you're doing in me let's stand what you we don't have to sing this I just wanted to refer back to it what you're doing in me is is not just to get me through the day it's not just to get me through the week the squeeze that I feel is for eternity what you're doing come on now unless you're going out if you're staying in stay with me for just a moment what you're doing in my life is not just to get me through Monday it's for eternity Lord if you're squeezing my job situ ation it's not just for now you are working something out in me for Eternal purposes if you're changing my address it's not just for now it's because you're working something Eternal if you're turning a storm you're doing it not just for now you're working something out right far more eternal yes we surrender hello we surrender to your will we surrender to your plan we surrender to your sovereignty You Are God Alone yes are hallelujah hallelujah when the storm hit Florida in the Big Bend of Florida where so many have come and where they predict there will be even perhaps another one before the season ends could come right up through the through the same place just after I was standing on the balcony a light rain and a gentle breeze and God's holy ghost had me declaring out that only his purposes we had no idea where it was going we had no idea where it would land where it would stall what would happen it was truly my desire to see it cross the State of Florida and be finished in the Atlantic but that wasn't God's plan and I'm standing there and all he would have me to say and do was to F was to declare that only his purposes would be fulfilled in this and his goodness was being accomplished in Mercy Lord your goodness is being accomplished in Mercy only your purposes are going to be fulfilled in this you've got a church that needs to wake up it's high time you've got a yet a a people who must come into alignment not only with your purposes for our lives but your purpos is for the nation of Israel God has spoken to this nation multiple times and he has shown one natural disaster after another after another to the tune of what could now be three trillion dollar worth of damage repair and everyone all almost every one of those directly connected to a time that this nation was putting pressure on Israel to give up instead of standing to give up in the midst of War Hezbollah having backing from Iran who's a half an inch away from nuclear weaponry more areas of Israel being targeted by missile and by rocket than have ever it has never happened quite like this before in all of the dark days of Israel and in the midst of it all still nearly a hundred hostages either alive maybe some are dead being held in uh Dungeons and tunnels while politicians ask Israel to cease fire what kind of fool would cease fire when under such attack they didn't strike first and our nation has no right and neither does the United Nations have any right to ask them to stop short and in the very week the UN called an emergency session once again to denounce Israel to demand a ceasefire to call Israel the aggressor to claim once again a partide and genocide and it passes and God said go ahead I'm going to talk to you now you say wait a minute it wasn't America no but America has most pressure power right do you really think that Israel cares what you you know some little you know leftover country of the of the United Soviet Socialist Republic what they think about Israel but they do care they have to care what America thinks because of our supply for their survival but that vote it matters in God's heart because it reminds us of a day when sheep Nations will stand on one side and goat Nations will stand on the other side and the Shepherd in the middle judged according to how they have treated the Jewish people scripture I'm not just making this up out of the top of my head it matters to God and God said I'll do what I did I I I I Woke Up This Nation in Katrina the word of the Lord came right here except except it was in Columbus sister elreda was there there may be others here who were there and God said I will blow my breath Upon This Storm Katrina and it will stall and change directions we were slated to have a direct hit in Shore and God did exactly what he said he was going to do he breath breathed on that storm and if you if you don't believe it I can show you the literature the print outs of the Articles where scientists said we've never seen a storm stall in the manner that this one stalled and then turn counterclockwise for a direct hit on New Orleans and had that not happened Pat Ingram wouldn't have come to Faith to know the Lord in the message message of the hour to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ had she not been displaced from Katrina never ended up of all the places she could have ended up she ended up here and you loved her and you accepted her with all of her idiosyncrasies and loved her and she loved you and God left her here to capture enough of the truth to be ready to meet the Lord and then he took her come on God had a plan Ben and I are standing in the store and this girl says I basically you're the only ones that's been here most of the day I've been here by myself since about 3:00 and she was tied in the middle and loose on both ends I just wanted to buy a little pair of sunglasses for my baby girl and she starts talking to us about Katrina of all things and she said would you believe that it was going to be a direct hit on this area and it was going to come right up through Alabama and right on up she said but it's stalled out there and turned directions and went straight I said yes ma'am I'd believe it and if I would have just had the want to get out of there so bad I'd have pulled up the prophecy on my phone you see the enemy tried to get in that and he said I'll just do what I want to do with it and God said oh no you won't I'll blow my breath see the enemy can whip up things but he can't change God's heart and mind for us you're going to make it you're going to make it all things work together for good you pray for your brothers and sisters who are still in the heat of this thing they're going to make it they're going to cling to the Lord and they're going to come out of this and God will render back to his people double that's how he works everything they lose he'll give them double back that's how God takes care of things if you get caught up in the middle of something God will help you he'll make a way where there's seems to be no way now we're going to leave here uh after we worship and we're going to worship him because he's Sovereign and we're going to say you're good God you are good and everything you [Music] do it broke my heart when they told me about Kate having this accident with his finger and basically blowing out the end of his finger and having to put in a splint and he had to take the splint off be able to play he wasn't sure that he'd be able to play today and it really bothered me just bothered me said Lord you know that things like that just ought not to have to happen isn't that how we feel but God had a reason yes we don't know what it is but God had a plan see it could have been his head could have been his neck could have been his back could have been his life but it was his finger if you'll let the Lord direct your thoughts and you'll look at life that way and realize that go I know it's horrible I know you've been through the most dark difficult things but oh how God has brought you through them what God has brought you through Jason what God has brought you through and we could go all over this room couldn't we do it what God has brought sister Flo through what God has brought April through what God has brought ma through just go all over this room shouldn't we praise blame him blame him or you
