[0:00] we will have to come out of that secret
[0:03] place
[0:04] with proof
[0:06] with evidence
[0:08] that we have been
[0:11] with the lord
[0:13] [Music]
[0:20] i don't believe that most intimacy with
[0:22] christ takes place in the church house
[0:25] i believe that most real relationship
[0:27] with him that that happens on the other
[0:30] side of the veil
[0:31] is in your private life
[0:33] and i encourage every one of you to get
[0:35] rid of things that you need to get rid
[0:36] of to make more time
[0:39] or discipline yourself if that's how you
[0:41] need to do it so that you can make more
[0:43] time i'm telling you it'll make all the
[0:45] difference in the world it's in that
[0:47] realm of intimacy that revelation begins
[0:50] to flow
[0:52] your identity begins to change
[0:55] and you begin to realize you're not just
[0:57] engaged to the bridegroom but he has
[1:00] claimed you as his own
[1:03] and he desires to know you as no one has
[1:06] ever known you
[1:09] because your heart responds by desiring
[1:12] to know him
[1:14] in a way that you've never known him you
[1:16] see there's coming an hour that we're
[1:18] not going to be able to fake it
[1:20] till we make it
[1:23] there's going to be an hour
[1:26] that we have to go all the way in
[1:32] we will have to come out of that secret
[1:34] place
[1:36] with proof
[1:38] with evidence
[1:40] that we have been with the lord
[1:47] you can't lie there with him
[1:50] and come out the same old same old same
[1:54] old
[1:55] same old
[1:57] you can't lay there with him
[2:00] and come out holding on
[2:03] to the things that weary you and worry
[2:06] you
[2:07] outside
[2:09] that bridal chamber
[2:11] you've got to be willing to lay all of
[2:14] that aside and sometimes we can't do it
[2:18] by ourself
[2:20] [Music]
[2:22] there's nothing like the ecstasy
[2:25] of knowing that you belong
[2:29] fully
[2:29] [Music]
[2:34] to him
