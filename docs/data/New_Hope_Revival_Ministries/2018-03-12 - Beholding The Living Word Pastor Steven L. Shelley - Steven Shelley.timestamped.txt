[0:45] [Music]
[1:00] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and I'm
[1:04] coming to you today on behalf of the
[1:06] gospel channel I want us to thank the
[1:09] Lord rejoice today for the gospel
[1:12] Channel and the work that they're doing
[1:14] to spread the good news of the Lord
[1:18] Jesus Christ and not only that I'm
[1:21] excited about the opportunity that we
[1:23] have to grow in our relationship with
[1:26] the Lord I believe there are people who
[1:29] will watch the gospel Channel who have
[1:31] never made a commitment to the Lord
[1:34] Jesus Christ and that excites me if I
[1:37] could just have a little part in helping
[1:39] you to know the reality of who Jesus is
[1:42] and what a difference he makes in your
[1:45] life well that would be wonderful
[1:47] it really would be but I'm also thankful
[1:50] that it's an opportunity to grow in our
[1:54] walk with the Lord to learn more about
[1:57] who he is and how do we do that we do
[2:00] that by the revelation of his word and
[2:03] so we just want to thank God for this
[2:06] opportunity and I always like to ask you
[2:09] to join us in prayer for brother Eric
[2:12] Erickson and the staff at the gospel
[2:16] channel and I also pray for all of those
[2:19] other ministers who are also given this
[2:23] opportunity to speak to you through the
[2:27] means of television and I pray that God
[2:29] will increase them and bless them and
[2:33] continue to reveal himself to them you
[2:36] know this is a body ministry in the end
[2:39] time and each of us including you have a
[2:42] part to add to building the kingdom of
[2:46] God the kingdom of God is not buildings
[2:49] it's not a churches or programs the
[2:52] kingdom of God is giving Jesus a throne
[2:55] that he can live inside of you jesus
[2:59] said that the kingdom of God is within
[3:01] men and so when we build ourselves up in
[3:05] the truth of God's Word we are helping
[3:09] to establish the kingdom of God and so I
[3:12] just want to say again how blessed we
[3:15] are to be a part of the gospel channel
[3:19] and I also represent our ministry new
[3:22] hope revival ministries in Smith Station
[3:25] Alabama USA and we want to invite you to
[3:29] contact us by telephone by email by
[3:32] snail mail if you have a prayer request
[3:35] the intercessors of our church would be
[3:38] so happy to pray with you to believe God
[3:41] with you we have even learned a few of
[3:44] our callers by name and I want you to
[3:48] know that your phone call is logged if
[3:51] there's no one to answer it it's still
[3:53] logged by the message that you leave and
[3:56] I look over them not only does the staff
[3:59] see them but I see them each and every
[4:02] day I can access them on my telephone if
[4:05] I'm not in the office and when I check
[4:07] those requests those calls then I go to
[4:11] the Lord in prayer I can also hear your
[4:14] your message that you leave remotely
[4:17] wherever I am I can hear your voice and
[4:20] I can hear your need and sometimes I can
[4:24] hear the cry of desperation sometimes I
[4:27] hear faith rising up in you as you share
[4:30] what you have need of and as I said a
[4:33] moment ago we're learning some of you by
[4:36] name and I love that I appreciate that
[4:39] it's been many years since I was in the
[4:42] United Kingdom or Scotland or Ireland
[4:44] I've been in all three to Minister the
[4:47] gospel in person but look what the Lord
[4:49] has done he gives me this opportunity to
[4:52] be near my home in Alabama and still be
[4:56] able to speak to you and I pray that
[4:58] it's an encouragement to you we've been
[5:01] talking about in our time together
[5:03] recently the Word of God and the
[5:07] importance of standing strong for the
[5:10] word of God taking sides with the Word
[5:13] of God not compromising in in a day
[5:17] where there is a whole lot of calm
[5:19] my's going on around us I believe that
[5:23] we certainly should love everyone pray
[5:26] for everyone believe that Jesus has a
[5:31] salvation plan that reaches all
[5:34] ethnicities all nations even religions
[5:39] because sometimes people are born into a
[5:42] religion and it's all they know well I
[5:45] want you to know that I believe
[5:48] personally that there is but one way to
[5:51] God in this hour for the Gentile nations
[5:54] and that is through salvation in the
[5:58] name of the Lord Jesus Christ he is the
[6:01] way he is the truth he is the life and
[6:05] so in this day people are coming to
[6:09] salvation by many means by witnessing
[6:14] you know I I you people who still preach
[6:18] on the street corner some in the UK in
[6:21] fact may be handing out tracts maybe by
[6:24] the local church maybe by a little
[6:27] saying on the sign outside the church
[6:30] house and people see it and they're
[6:33] compelled to come and they hear the
[6:35] great story the love story that God so
[6:39] loved this world that He gave His only
[6:43] begotten Son that whosoever believeth on
[6:47] him might not perish but have
[6:50] everlasting eternal life and that's
[6:56] where the journey begins that's not the
[6:58] ending of the journey that's the
[7:00] beginning of the Christian journey and
[7:03] so I'm just thankful that there are many
[7:07] many testimonies we get to hear them of
[7:11] what God is doing in the nations of the
[7:13] world and we're thankful to have a small
[7:16] part in that but I want you to know
[7:18] there's a lot of things going on that
[7:20] that never get reported on the on the
[7:23] Christian news we never read about them
[7:25] on Facebook or social media but I want
[7:28] you to know God's got some faithful
[7:30] witness
[7:31] says in many many places some of which
[7:34] it's illegal some of the places it's
[7:38] illegal to witness to speak about the
[7:41] truth of salvation through Jesus Christ
[7:44] and there are brave and courageous
[7:46] soldiers of the Cross who are sharing
[7:49] the gospel and when we get to hear of a
[7:52] testimony like that someone going into
[7:55] some of those places I hesitate to even
[7:58] name the places but when we hear that
[8:01] God is opening the spiritually blinded
[8:05] eyes of so many and bringing them to a
[8:09] place of salvation and hope some of them
[8:12] say for the first time in their life
[8:14] well it's a blessing and it's an
[8:17] encouragement and I hope that it will
[8:19] encourage you to keep sharing your faith
[8:22] when we've been talking about the Word
[8:24] of God and the importance of the Word of
[8:27] God it's about living the word and we
[8:31] cannot do that but by the power of the
[8:35] Holy Spirit it's only because of his
[8:38] presence his divine spirit life-giving
[8:41] spirit that lives inside of us that we
[8:45] can even begin to have the strength or
[8:48] the power or the courage to live the
[8:51] Christian life we're not talking about a
[8:54] religious life of only do's and don'ts
[8:57] and rules and restrictions I believe
[9:00] that God gives us instructions in his
[9:03] word that we should live by that I'm not
[9:06] talking about that I'm talking about a
[9:09] relationship I'm talking about learning
[9:12] of him learning of him letting him
[9:15] reveal himself to you in a very personal
[9:18] way I'd like to read a portion of
[9:21] scripture to you today that we shared in
[9:25] one of our times together and that was
[9:27] from 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 and verse
[9:31] 18 and it speaks about one degree of
[9:36] glory to another it speaks about with
[9:40] unveiled face beholding the glory
[9:43] Corie of the Lord and being transformed
[9:46] into the same image from one degree of
[9:50] glory to another I love this concept of
[9:54] one degree of glory to another and I
[9:58] started looking at that word that's used
[10:00] several times in the Bible
[10:02] in Romans chapter 12 and verse 2 it's
[10:06] also used so let's let's grab that verse
[10:09] here for just a moment Romans chapter 12
[10:13] verse 2 do not be conformed to this
[10:17] world this age fashioned after and
[10:22] adapted to its external superficial
[10:27] customs but be transformed in
[10:32] parentheses that reached changed by the
[10:35] entire renewal of your mind oh my that's
[10:41] where it begins and that's where it
[10:44] continues is in our mind our ability to
[10:49] be renewed in our mind by the by the
[10:53] entire renewal of your mind by its new
[10:56] ideals and its new attitude I want you
[11:00] to know that a relationship with the
[11:03] Living Word standing with the Living
[11:06] Word the Lord Jesus Christ it is a place
[11:10] of finding new attitude and new thoughts
[11:13] I remember the old timers in the
[11:16] Pentecostal church that I grew up in
[11:19] they would often testify and say the
[11:23] things that I once loved I now hate and
[11:26] the things that I once hated and
[11:28] despised I now love I'll never forget
[11:33] those precious testimonies some of them
[11:36] I knew their life later as I grew older
[11:39] I learned just how far God had brought
[11:43] them from and it made me appreciate
[11:46] their testimony even more but that's
[11:48] what the scripture says old things Paul
[11:52] tells us the great apostle old things
[11:56] have
[11:57] passed away and behold all things become
[12:03] new changed a new attitude a new desire
[12:07] new loves and even the opportunity to to
[12:13] refrain to stand away from some of the
[12:16] things that the spirit of this age would
[12:20] use to grab ahold of us and pull us in
[12:23] perhaps to some form of addiction or
[12:26] destructive behavior I want you to know
[12:29] you can be a new creature if you can
[12:32] learn to yield and trust the Living Word
[12:35] of God Jesus Christ living inside of you
[12:39] by a spirit do not be conformed to this
[12:43] world this age fashioned after and
[12:48] adapted to its external superficial
[12:52] customs but be transformed changed by
[12:58] the entire renewal of your mind by its
[13:02] new ideas ideals and its new attitude so
[13:07] that you may prove for yourselves what
[13:11] is the good and acceptable and perfect
[13:14] will of God even the thing which is good
[13:18] and acceptable and perfect in his sight
[13:23] for you this is very interesting to me
[13:27] the way the amplified bible brings this
[13:30] out in order to discover God's will for
[13:34] your life the reason you were born
[13:37] that's what God's will is if you can
[13:40] find what God's will is for your life
[13:44] you can discover the reason that you
[13:47] were born you know mine is simple I know
[13:51] that that I was called to preach the
[13:54] gospel and I know different aspects of
[13:57] the ministry that the Lord gave me when
[13:59] I was just a child but if I boiled it
[14:02] all down to one simple phrase and you
[14:07] asked me a question
[14:09] were you born I would have to say it
[14:12] this way I was born to serve the Lord I
[14:15] know that I don't know that because the
[14:19] pastor told me the preacher told me my
[14:21] grandmother told me or my parents told
[14:24] me I know it because it became a living
[14:27] reality to me by the precious power of
[14:30] the Holy Spirit you see it's the Spirit
[14:33] of God let me make sure that you get
[14:37] what I'm trying to say and that is it's
[14:40] the Spirit of God the presence of God
[14:43] his life his breath that makes the
[14:47] written word live and become personal to
[14:52] us and Paul is saying here we are not to
[14:56] be conformed to this world patterning
[14:59] our life after the spirit of the age
[15:01] around us but rather we're to be
[15:04] transformed that's the same word in the
[15:08] Greek it it is Metamorpho and of course
[15:13] I think that would be a little familiar
[15:15] to some of you because you've heard this
[15:18] scientific concept of metamorphosis it's
[15:23] the process by which the caterpillar
[15:26] becomes a butterfly and hey there's a
[15:30] whole lot that happens in between you
[15:32] see that little worm crawling on your
[15:35] rosebush and then later you begin to see
[15:38] the butterflies fluttering fluttering
[15:40] around your garden you've got to
[15:43] remember there's a whole process between
[15:44] worm and butterfly
[15:46] there's the spinning first that's eating
[15:49] everything in sight that's kind of like
[15:52] that's kind of like the Christian who
[15:54] discovers the power of the word of God
[15:57] and the nourishment really spiritual
[16:01] nourishment that we receive from the
[16:03] word and we're just gorging eating
[16:05] everything I remember I remember those
[16:08] times in my Christian journey when my
[16:10] hunger for God's Word was bigger than I
[16:13] was and I couldn't get enough of it and
[16:15] I tell you when you get in a place like
[16:18] that stay there as long as you possibly
[16:21] can
[16:22] I believe there are herbs and flows in
[16:24] the Christian journey I believe we have
[16:26] to always diligently read the Word of
[16:29] God but I don't believe that that our
[16:32] whole journey is a journey of just
[16:34] gorging and reading and listening to
[16:36] teaching and I believe there are times
[16:38] where we have to begin to process what
[16:40] we have read and what we have heard and
[16:43] we have to decide what our response and
[16:46] what our reaction is going to be and
[16:49] then we move forward and we begin to
[16:52] continue that growing process but I can
[16:56] see that also we use the word
[16:59] metamorphosis the little tadpole in the
[17:02] in the creek out there that it has a
[17:06] little tail it looks like a little
[17:07] pollywog a little a little fishy looking
[17:09] thing and over a process of
[17:13] metamorphosis that tail drops off and
[17:17] legs begin to grow and the next thing
[17:19] you know you've got a jumping frog in
[17:22] the garden spooking you if you're down
[17:25] trying to take care of the of the
[17:27] flowers every time I see a frog every
[17:31] time I see a butterfly
[17:32] I actually think about this process of
[17:35] metamorphosis where we are transformed
[17:39] by the renewing of our mind transformed
[17:43] by beholding the glory of the Lord with
[17:47] an unveiled face looking upon his image
[17:51] in the word from one degree of glory to
[17:54] another or as we just read not being
[17:58] conformed but being transformed all from
[18:01] this concept of metamorphosis being
[18:04] changed right back to what we said a
[18:07] moment ago the old old man gone and a
[18:10] new man a new creation in Jesus Christ I
[18:15] want you to know that I I'm sensing as
[18:18] I'm sharing with you right now that that
[18:21] many are listening who have had what you
[18:24] might call a false start you begin to
[18:28] trust the Lord with your life you heard
[18:30] the Gospel message you repented of your
[18:33] sins
[18:34] you began that process of being a new
[18:37] Christian and somehow along the way you
[18:41] had the wind knocked out of you life got
[18:44] tough in a hurry and hey let me go ahead
[18:47] and tell any of you that haven't
[18:49] experienced that it can come it's
[18:53] because the enemy is not going to lay
[18:56] down the one who is banished to hell
[19:00] enemy your enemy Lucifer the one who was
[19:04] a created cherub of God but by his own
[19:08] pride he tried to exalt himself against
[19:11] the knowledge of God and the throne of
[19:13] God and he fell and we know him as Satan
[19:17] and yes he is real I know there may be
[19:20] people watching this broadcast that you
[19:22] don't believe in a literal devil but I
[19:24] want you to know if you look around you
[19:27] and you see what evil is doing and you
[19:30] say well that's just man's heart oh no I
[19:33] want you to know there's a greater
[19:34] darkness than just the heart of man that
[19:37] follows after evil there is a devil and
[19:40] he's not going to lay down and play dead
[19:43] while you grow in the grace and in the
[19:46] knowledge of Jesus Christ he's going to
[19:49] do everything he can we say to pull the
[19:53] rug out from under you he wants to turn
[19:56] your life upside down
[19:58] he does not want you to surrender to
[20:01] your Creator so you can expect a battle
[20:04] when you start out to serve the Lord so
[20:07] to those of you who had the start and
[20:10] then you fail and some of you fell hard
[20:14] and the discouragement and sometimes
[20:17] even the embarrassment of a failing kept
[20:22] you from starting again and pressing in
[20:26] and so you have sort of watched the
[20:29] things of God from a distance you keep
[20:33] up with some of the things that are
[20:35] going on with family members who are
[20:37] believers or you watch on occasion
[20:42] Christian television but you're not
[20:44] following the Lord
[20:46] mostly as you did in the beginning I'm
[20:49] speaking to you right now from his love
[20:52] for you you can do it you can recommit
[20:56] your life to him he allows you turns you
[21:00] turn to him the circumstances of life
[21:03] your enemy come with a with a vengeance
[21:08] you know he came with a vengeance to try
[21:11] to destroy you and you and maybe your
[21:14] feet were knocked out from under you and
[21:16] you just over a period of time gave up I
[21:19] want to call you in the name of the Lord
[21:22] I want to call you out of that place of
[21:25] of what you feel like was a failure I
[21:28] want to call you up I want to encourage
[21:31] you that you can make it not by your
[21:35] strength not by your good works not by
[21:38] your talent or your intellect but by
[21:41] grace you are saved it is a gift of God
[21:47] you must believe for that grace you must
[21:52] believe that that gift is given to you
[21:56] and by faith accept it and receive it
[22:01] once you repent of of any failure that
[22:05] you made or any embarrassment that you
[22:09] might have brought on the name of the
[22:12] Lord
[22:14] disappointment for with others and you
[22:17] you feel bad about it and so you say
[22:19] lord please have mercy on me give me
[22:22] grace to rise again to walk in wisdom
[22:26] and slowly until you feel yourself
[22:30] strengthened this is what I invite you
[22:34] to do I invite you to begin again it's
[22:40] not too late if there's breath in your
[22:43] body
[22:44] and you feel the pull toward the things
[22:47] of God for me this means that you have
[22:51] not committed the unpardonable sin of
[22:55] blasphemy against the Holy Ghost
[22:57] you no matter how deep your sin has gone
[23:01] no matter how many lives you have
[23:05] affected in a very negative way by your
[23:09] choices there is still grace for you and
[23:13] the very fact that you'd stop and listen
[23:16] to this kind of message right now and
[23:19] the fact that you would feel but drawing
[23:22] toward the Lord to me is evidence that
[23:27] there's hope for you that God is
[23:29] reaching out to you and you may just
[23:31] discover as I discovered a long time ago
[23:34] that you were born to serve the Lord as
[23:38] I was born to serve the Lord we serve
[23:41] Him differently according to the gifts
[23:43] and the callings and the talents that he
[23:46] gives us in life but to serve Him is our
[23:50] reason for being here to love him and to
[23:53] point others to that relationship of
[23:58] restoration bringing us back into
[24:00] fellowship with our Creator our Creator
[24:04] loved us so much that he became flesh
[24:08] and lived the life of a man in a man's
[24:15] body
[24:16] suffered great rejection great pain
[24:19] great agony on the cross and shed his
[24:23] blood and yet he did not fail us that's
[24:27] the love that God has for you let me
[24:30] just read a scripture that came in my
[24:34] mind as we were talking and I didn't
[24:36] mean to leave you hanging there but I
[24:39] just felt like there was someone who
[24:41] needed to get up again and I know it may
[24:44] not be easy for you but but would you
[24:47] try would you try not in your strength
[24:51] when I say try I mean make up your mind
[24:54] that's the one thing you can do it's
[24:57] really the only thing you can do is to
[24:59] make up your mind to accept God's gift
[25:02] to you
[25:03] and begin again the rest of it is in his
[25:07] hands he'll take it
[25:10] don't worry he'll help you bear the
[25:14] burden that you might have to bear
[25:15] getting started or continuing the
[25:19] journey whichever it is he is for you
[25:22] and not against you he wants to draw you
[25:26] into himself he's not trying to push you
[25:30] away he's trying to draw you in come
[25:33] back all backslider hear the Lord hear
[25:36] the Lord come back to him make your
[25:39] heart with a new commitment give a new
[25:43] commitment from your heart to the Lord
[25:46] John 1:1 amplified version says in the
[25:50] beginning before all time was the word
[25:53] and in the amplified it says Christ and
[25:56] the Word was with God and the Word was
[25:59] God himself this is the promise of the
[26:05] scripture the prophet Isaiah prophesied
[26:08] that he would come and that he would be
[26:11] Almighty God Yahshua the Messiah Jesus
[26:15] Christ our Savior our Lord was and is
[26:21] the word of God made flesh he became a
[26:27] high priest on our behalf and in order
[26:32] to really know what our life is like and
[26:35] the feelings and temptations of of the
[26:38] human life on earth he came down and
[26:40] became like us I tell you I've known
[26:45] that a long time by revelation and I've
[26:47] preached it hundreds of times and yet it
[26:50] excites me to say it thirty years later
[26:53] after preaching it well actually a few
[26:57] more years than thirty but anyway it
[27:00] still excites me to say that he loved me
[27:04] so much that he wanted to be a high
[27:07] priest who could be touched with the
[27:10] feeling of my infirmities and he knows
[27:14] my temptations and he knows the
[27:17] weaknesses of the human flesh and he was
[27:20] tempted in all manner like we are
[27:23] without sin and he said I have overcome
[27:26] the world
[27:27] and because I have guess what you can to
[27:31] just get up and get going again I really
[27:35] encourage you to do that
[27:37] this word transformed metamorphosis is
[27:43] not our responsibility it's God's
[27:46] responsibility what do we do we keep
[27:49] looking at the word we're talking about
[27:53] Jesus Christ the Living Word but how do
[27:56] we know him more
[27:57] how do we begin to understand his love
[28:00] for us more we look to the written word
[28:03] so truthfully there is change in the
[28:07] written word of God but for total
[28:11] transformation in our life it can only
[28:14] come when the written word is made alive
[28:16] when it's quickened by the very spirit
[28:20] of Jesus Christ living inside of the
[28:23] believer we need the Holy Spirit I'm not
[28:26] going to beat around the bush because I
[28:28] love you we need the Holy Spirit in our
[28:32] lives we need not just the spirit of
[28:36] transformation or the spirit of
[28:38] conversion we sometimes say the Spirit
[28:41] of the Lord that comes in when we are
[28:43] originally converted when we originally
[28:46] surrender to salvation but I mean I mean
[28:50] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[28:52] baptism of the Holy Spirit where we're
[28:55] not just filled up with his spirit but
[28:57] then we are baptized immersed filled up
[29:01] and filled all around us with the Spirit
[29:04] of God we need that because that's the
[29:08] atmosphere totally immersed totally
[29:12] wrapped up in the Spirit of God and that
[29:15] happens by creating the right atmosphere
[29:17] in reading in worship in prayer he
[29:21] surrounds us he fills us were baptized
[29:24] with his life and it's in that place
[29:27] that real transformation real
[29:31] metamorphosis by the Spirit takes place
[29:34] in our life
[29:36] I was going to read another portion of
[29:40] Scripture I think I have time to go
[29:42] there
[29:43] revelation one of my favorite books of
[29:47] the Bible people often say oh I'm scared
[29:51] that's a southern way of saying scared I
[29:54] think you probably got it I'm scared of
[29:57] the book of Revelation because I read
[30:00] about great wrath and great judgment and
[30:03] hailstones falling and and woes and
[30:07] plagues and seals and all kinds of
[30:11] trumpets and vials yes you do there's
[30:16] some very serious things some of which
[30:18] have already happened on planet earth in
[30:21] its history some of which are happening
[30:24] now and some of which are to happen in
[30:27] the future but I don't find the book of
[30:30] Revelation to be a scary book because a
[30:33] great portion of the book of Revelation
[30:36] actually takes place before the throne
[30:39] of God you're focusing on what's
[30:42] happening on planet earth and indeed we
[30:45] would because this is where we live for
[30:47] now is planet Earth but what we have to
[30:50] do is set our affection on things above
[30:52] we have to begin to read the book of
[30:54] Revelation and understand also what's
[30:57] happening before the throne of God and I
[31:00] tell you when you begin to recognize
[31:02] that you've got a home beyond the one
[31:04] you live in now you've got a body to
[31:07] live in beyond the one that you live in
[31:10] now you have a promised destiny of of
[31:14] eternal life if you're willing to accept
[31:17] it and only you can make that choice it
[31:20] can't be made for you where time has no
[31:23] hold on you anymore and thank god
[31:26] there's no old age there is another
[31:29] place and much of that is also revealed
[31:33] in the book of Revelation so approach
[31:36] that book like you approach any other
[31:39] book with prayer and with allowing God's
[31:43] Holy Ghost power to come and inspire you
[31:49] and quicken you and make the Word of God
[31:51] real to you
[31:52] then you may indeed have something to
[31:54] warn your neighbors about but don't let
[31:57] your focus be only on the things
[32:00] transitioning transpiring on planet
[32:03] earth but also remember that you've got
[32:06] something waiting on you that's revealed
[32:08] before the throne of God Revelation
[32:11] chapter 1 this is John on the Isle of
[32:15] Patmos in the spirit on the Lord's Day
[32:17] and that means he was caught up by the
[32:21] Spirit of God to the day of the Lord and
[32:24] I I believe he saw my day I believe he
[32:28] saw this hour we're living in right now
[32:31] also and I believe that some of the
[32:34] things that we read about are for our
[32:37] generation and beyond but I want to look
[32:40] at verse 12 a moment then I turn to see
[32:43] whose was the voice that was speaking to
[32:46] me and on turning I saw seven golden
[32:49] lampstands and in the midst of the
[32:52] lampstands one like a son of man clothed
[32:55] with a robe which reached to his feet
[32:57] and with a girdle of gold about his
[33:00] breast his head and his hair were white
[33:03] like white wool as white as snow and his
[33:06] eyes flashed like a flame of fire
[33:10] verse 15 his feet glowed like bright
[33:14] burnished bronze as it is refined in the
[33:17] furnace and his voice was like the sound
[33:20] of many waters in his right hand he held
[33:23] seven stars and from his mouth there
[33:25] came forth a sharp two-edged sword and
[33:28] his face was like the sun shining in
[33:31] full power at midday but I wanted to
[33:35] focus on verse 17 with you for a moment
[33:38] I wanted to focus on John's response to
[33:43] the word remember we've been emphasizing
[33:46] the word the Word of God both written
[33:50] and living we also talked about being
[33:54] careful what you hear and being careful
[33:57] how you hear the word of God how
[34:00] important it is
[34:01] to go back and revisit the truths that
[34:05] we hear and let God unveil them to us
[34:08] personally and having the right response
[34:11] and the right reaction I want you to
[34:14] listen at John's reaction to seeing the
[34:17] Word of God the glorified Christ the
[34:23] Lord Jesus Christ in a glorified body
[34:27] expressing the Sevenfold glory of his
[34:30] person John saw him that day in a way
[34:34] that was so different from the last time
[34:37] it was so powerful and so beautiful -
[34:42] John that verse 17 gives us his reaction
[34:47] when I saw him I fell at his feet as if
[34:53] dead but he laid his right hand on me
[34:56] and said do not be afraid I am the first
[35:02] and the last and the everliving one I am
[35:06] living in the Eternity of the eternity I
[35:09] died but see I am alive forevermore and
[35:12] I possessed the keys of death and Hades
[35:15] the realm of the Dead we're talking
[35:19] about that place of Hell how powerful
[35:24] the expression of Jesus Christ the
[35:28] Living Word - John that day on the Isle
[35:31] of Patmos and John notice he didn't
[35:36] Google to see what his reaction was
[35:39] supposed to be he responded remember
[35:43] this is John who spent so much time when
[35:47] Jesus was alive in his earthly body John
[35:50] spent so much time with his head just
[35:53] leaned over on the chest on the shoulder
[35:56] of the Lord which I love that so much
[35:59] because if you notice in in the Gospel
[36:02] of John he often refers to himself as
[36:06] that disciple that Jesus loved someone
[36:09] said well wasn't that a prideful thing
[36:11] for John to say oh no
[36:13] oh no he had a revelation I would that
[36:18] you and I could have a similar
[36:21] revelation of his love for us when we
[36:26] get it we almost feel like he loves us
[36:29] more than anybody else I used to hear
[36:32] also old-timers in the church I grew up
[36:34] in say I just feel sometimes like he
[36:37] loves me more than he loves anybody else
[36:41] on the planet I understand that
[36:43] expression because that's how it can
[36:46] make you feel when you get in that
[36:48] atmosphere of his love when you get in
[36:52] that place so John he didn't just sit on
[36:55] the church pew that day with his hands
[36:57] folded no he didn't say well I'm not a
[37:01] Pentecostal so I can't raise my hands
[37:04] and worship the Lord no he didn't say I
[37:08] think I'll find another church to
[37:10] worship in because this one's getting
[37:11] too rowdy for me no he responded I mean
[37:17] he really reacted and responded to
[37:20] Christ the Living Word that was standing
[37:22] before him he fell over on his face like
[37:26] a dead man he was overwhelmed by the
[37:32] presence of the Living Word of God
[37:36] it made him want to worship it made him
[37:40] want to get as low as he possibly could
[37:44] John in his reaction is actually
[37:48] teaching us a little bit about what
[37:50] worship is supposed to be like worship
[37:54] is not supposed to be focused on what
[37:59] he's doing for us it's supposed to be
[38:02] focused on who he is it's not worship is
[38:07] not particularly to be about parading
[38:12] around and showing everybody just how
[38:16] good we are oh this seems to be a modern
[38:20] concept of worship oh I don't want to be
[38:23] critical but sometimes it looks a little
[38:26] bit
[38:26] more like a concert which I think is I
[38:28] think it's wonderful to go to a concert
[38:31] and hear wonderful God edifying music I
[38:35] do I think that's wonderful but it just
[38:38] doesn't feel to me sometimes like what
[38:41] real worship is supposed to be like in
[38:43] church or even in my personal life in
[38:47] fact I find that when I'm really moved
[38:49] to worship I shut everything else out
[38:52] anyway
[38:53] I don't even know what they're singing
[38:55] or I don't even know what what music I'm
[38:57] listening to because there's that realm
[39:00] there's that atmosphere that we get in
[39:03] where we're just dead we're just dead
[39:05] before him I remember a woman of God who
[39:11] wrote some beautiful inspirational books
[39:15] and she had a beautiful life as a
[39:19] missionary for many years to both China
[39:22] and later to Israel she wrote about
[39:26] worship she wrote about praise and she
[39:30] compared it to entering into the holy of
[39:34] Holy's we start in the outer court we
[39:38] move into that holy place but in that
[39:41] holy of holies that's worship you know
[39:44] praise goes on whether it's busyness and
[39:47] activity you know I'm a rowdy
[39:49] Pentecostal myself I like good praise
[39:53] clapping my hands and stomping my foot
[39:56] and getting excited about the Lord I
[39:59] know it a lot of people are opposed to
[40:02] that but they get really excited at the
[40:04] at the football game they get real
[40:07] excited at the baseball game or the or
[40:10] the boxing match but they they become
[40:15] different creatures in church when given
[40:18] an opportunity to worship the Lord then
[40:20] they're also reserved well why do they
[40:22] get so excited at the sporting event
[40:25] because they're passionate about it
[40:26] because they enjoy it because it's
[40:30] they're not out there on the field but
[40:32] but they almost begin to feel like
[40:34] they're the ones I've seen people act in
[40:36] the stands like they were out
[40:39] they're on the field and they'll say
[40:41] well look at us now look at who you're
[40:44] in the stand they're down on the field
[40:46] or people will come away my team won we
[40:50] won that match you didn't win it you're
[40:53] a fan watching you're an observer some
[40:56] some of you watching it on television
[40:58] why do you say that I'll tell you why
[41:00] because you feel connected you feel
[41:03] identified with that team
[41:04] you've got passion for them you're a
[41:06] true fan I want you to know that praise
[41:09] is a little bit like that you're
[41:12] identifying yourself with the life of
[41:15] Jesus Christ and you begin to feel a
[41:18] part of him you begin to feel a part of
[41:21] what's going on in the spiritual
[41:23] atmosphere and so praise can sometimes
[41:26] be a little noisy it can sometimes be a
[41:28] little rowdy the music can sometimes be
[41:31] a little faster than average but when
[41:34] you begin to enter into that place of
[41:36] glory see there's lots of anointing lots
[41:40] of spirit that can come in praise but
[41:44] when we enter into that Holy of Holies
[41:45] in that realm of deeper glory there's
[41:49] not a lot of noise I'm telling you you
[41:53] couldn't jump around and enjoy yourself
[41:57] nearly as much if at all in that realm
[42:00] of glory because when you enter into
[42:03] that complete divine presence of Jesus
[42:07] Christ like John did here in Revelation
[42:09] chapter one about the best you can do is
[42:12] fall on your face like a dead man
[42:15] knowing that you'd lay there just dead
[42:18] unless he raises you up and strengthens
[42:22] you to go on and live your life John
[42:25] said but he reached his hand and touched
[42:27] me and said do not be afraid I'm telling
[42:30] you if you have any sense of the Lord's
[42:33] comfort when you're afraid when you're
[42:35] in a trial when you're going through
[42:37] something very difficult and hard in
[42:39] your life if you can just get quiet come
[42:43] to him almost like a dead man I tell you
[42:47] what this may seem old-fashioned you can
[42:50] just laugh if it's too old-fashioned for
[42:52] you you
[42:53] might ought to just get down on your rug
[42:55] in your living room right on your face
[42:58] no one's watching you maybe just get
[43:01] down sometime beside your bed and just
[43:04] lay right flat on the floor and say I
[43:06] want to acknowledge that you are Lord of
[43:11] my life you are not just my hobby on
[43:15] Sunday you are my every day you are my
[43:19] everything you are the reason I live and
[43:24] unless you raise me up I just as well to
[43:28] stay here and lay on my face the rest of
[43:30] my life because I can't do anything
[43:33] without your touch anyway unless you
[43:36] touch me unless you anoint me unless you
[43:39] strengthen me and reveal yourself to me
[43:41] I'm useless I'm almost paralyzed I don't
[43:47] have the ability and myself to live the
[43:50] Christ life the Jesus life I tell you if
[43:54] God begins to hear things from you from
[43:58] the sincerity of your heart like that
[44:01] you may just find him showing up in real
[44:05] ways you may just find encounters with
[44:09] him that you never dreamed possible on a
[44:12] personal level and I'm not talking about
[44:15] a vivid imagination I'm talking about
[44:18] the reality of a visitation from the
[44:21] genuine Spirit of God it's not only
[44:25] possible it's life-changing and if you
[44:29] position yourself it's probable but we
[44:34] have to get still I love John's reaction
[44:37] I mean John was bold John was not a
[44:41] pushover he was a bold man he had
[44:44] already suffered a lot of things for the
[44:46] name of Jesus he had been twice wasn't
[44:51] it boiled in oil they had done
[44:54] everything to try to destroy him and
[44:57] stop him and put fear in him and even
[44:59] kill him and when they couldn't fry him
[45:02] like a like a french fry or
[45:06] you'd say across the United Kingdom like
[45:09] chips when they couldn't do that they
[45:12] just put him on an island where there
[45:14] were historians believe there were wild
[45:18] animals and other robbers at times had
[45:23] been put out there and they'd come back
[45:25] and found their bones they banished him
[45:28] there to die but if you know the rest of
[45:31] the story you'll know John didn't die on
[45:32] the Isle of Patmos that wasn't the end
[45:35] of his story it was the beginning of a
[45:38] greater chapter in his life
[45:40] but he was put there to die and oh my
[45:45] what God did for him and gave him a
[45:48] message that was to be preserved for for
[45:52] the end time the hour that we're living
[45:54] in right now and he had encountered the
[45:57] presence of God remember he saw the
[45:59] miracles he knew what the power of God
[46:01] was like but in this fullness you see he
[46:05] was seeing not only Jesus Christ in a
[46:08] way he had never seen him before
[46:10] and that's certainly true but he was
[46:14] being unveiled to John Jesus was being
[46:18] unveiled it's the apocalypsis it's that
[46:21] Greek word that speaks to us about the
[46:24] unveiling of Jesus Christ to see him
[46:27] more clearly than we have ever seen him
[46:30] before there's more to Jesus than our
[46:33] Sunday School lessons there's more to
[46:36] Jesus than than what most of us heard in
[46:41] in our traditional upbringing he's not
[46:46] just an entity or a person a million
[46:51] miles away of which we should walk
[46:53] around on planet Earth in constant fear
[46:56] of him
[46:57] you know ducking to make sure that he
[47:00] doesn't kill us
[47:02] we have oftentimes developed a a concept
[47:09] of God and we have not understood the
[47:13] oneness of Jesus and his father and we
[47:17] become afraid
[47:19] God now the fear of the Lord is a
[47:22] reverential fear but it's not a cowering
[47:26] paralyzing fear that keeps us from
[47:28] serving him but what if I told you that
[47:32] you can have a personal relationship
[47:36] with Jesus Christ knowing in the depth
[47:42] of who you are that he is unveiling
[47:45] himself and making himself real to you
[47:48] because of his great love what if I told
[47:52] you that that doesn't have to take place
[47:54] at the hand of a priest or even at the
[47:59] hand of a preacher but thank God for
[48:02] preachers you know God uses preachers he
[48:08] uses the foolishness of preaching to
[48:11] reveal much of who he is to us but that
[48:16] could never replace the joy and the
[48:20] experience of having a personal
[48:22] relationship with Jesus Christ well
[48:26] brother Shelly they don't teach that in
[48:28] my church or that's not how I was raised
[48:30] I didn't grow up that way with all due
[48:34] respect my friend then check the word
[48:37] check the Word of God and see what it
[48:40] says about what is possible when we
[48:43] abide in him and he abides in us see
[48:48] what Jesus said when he explained that
[48:51] he was one with his father and that he
[48:53] desired to have that same relationship
[48:56] with us that he has with his father
[49:00] oneness and union you know that's beyond
[49:05] fellowship it's even in a place that's
[49:09] beyond Communion and and friendship it's
[49:14] a place of oneness that's a big subject
[49:18] and maybe we'll talk about it another
[49:20] time the joy of of the journey toward
[49:26] becoming one with Jesus Christ
[49:29] let me read another
[49:31] portion of scripture to you before we we
[49:34] go too much farther Hebrews chapter 4
[49:37] and verses 12 and 13 in the King James
[49:43] it says and I'm going to read a little
[49:47] bit of it so that you'll recognize it
[49:49] for the word of God is quick and
[49:51] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[49:54] sword I know you've heard the scripture
[49:57] before but I'm going to share it in the
[50:00] amplified for the word that God speaks
[50:04] is alive and full of power making it
[50:10] active operative energizing and
[50:15] effective now I I confess
[50:18] that's amplified it's it's it's a lot of
[50:22] words for one or two words in the King
[50:25] James but all it makes me glad it makes
[50:29] me glad and it's the truth because the
[50:33] word that God speaks is active it's not
[50:37] it's not stationary or stagnant static
[50:42] it moves it lives it transforms the
[50:49] hearts of men and women its operative
[50:53] its energizing and thanks be to God it
[50:57] is effective it if it produces it
[51:01] affects us and it causes beautiful
[51:06] effects in our life it changes us it is
[51:11] sharper than any two-edged sword
[51:13] penetrating to the dividing line of the
[51:18] breath of life soul and the immortal
[51:20] spirit and of joints and marrow of the
[51:24] deepest parts of our nature exposing and
[51:27] sifting and analyzing and judging the
[51:30] very thoughts and purposes of the heart
[51:33] did you know the Word of God was capable
[51:35] of doing all those things in your life
[51:39] as an individual or the
[51:41] said so the written record of God's Word
[51:45] tells us that the word this word
[51:48] quickened by the life-giving spirit is
[51:52] able to accomplish all of these things
[51:54] in her life and verse 13 not a creature
[51:58] exists that is concealed from his sight
[52:02] but all things are open and exposed
[52:05] naked and defenseless to the eyes of him
[52:08] whom we have to do that's a powerful
[52:14] word the Word of God and it's expressed
[52:19] beautifully here in these verses of
[52:22] Scripture I wanted to focus on verse 13
[52:25] as we come to a close of our time today
[52:29] this part where it says open and exposed
[52:35] the new American Standard Version of the
[52:37] Bible takes verse 13 and it translates
[52:40] it this way open and laid bare in King
[52:47] James it says all things are naked and
[52:50] opened unto Him or unto his eyes but
[52:55] this word is an interesting word it's a
[52:58] Greek word and it means to seize by the
[53:03] throat or the neck to expose the gullet
[53:09] of a victim for killing wasn't that an
[53:14] interesting choice of words for the
[53:17] Apostle to use in writing his letter to
[53:21] the Hebrew believers it literally means
[53:25] to not hide your neck to go ahead and
[53:30] expose your neck so that the knife can
[53:36] be laid to your throat for death I don't
[53:40] know about you but that's a little
[53:41] disturbing but in a good way because
[53:44] this is the effectiveness of the word of
[53:47] God if we are willing in fact it
[53:51] it let me read this to you the words
[53:54] laid bare in verse 13 are from the Greek
[53:58] word trek Lizzio which literally means
[54:02] to seize and bend back the neck exposing
[54:05] the throat as with an animal that was
[54:08] being slaughtered or sacrificed this is
[54:12] why Paul would use such a word when
[54:14] speaking to the Jewish believers the
[54:16] Hebrew believers who had come to faith
[54:19] in Jesus as the Messiah because they
[54:22] were very familiar with the concept of
[54:24] animal sacrifice and so this is exactly
[54:28] what was what was being hinted at if not
[54:32] directly spoken the word is also used to
[54:35] describe action on the battlefield
[54:39] what's happening when we keep coming to
[54:43] the Word of God allowing the Word of God
[54:46] to to be effective in our lives praying
[54:49] praying to God Lord let your word change
[54:54] me transform me strengthen me empower me
[54:57] what we're really doing is exposing our
[55:00] nakedness to Christ or we are exposing
[55:03] our neck to him you know what we're
[55:05] saying
[55:06] we're saying I'm laying down my life I
[55:09] want you to use your word to examine
[55:14] every motive every intent of my heart
[55:19] that would keep me from fulfilling the
[55:23] reason of my birth if indeed I was born
[55:26] to serve the Lord I've told you that I
[55:29] believe that's the summary of why I was
[55:31] born is to serve the Lord then that
[55:35] would be my prayer Lord I expose my neck
[55:38] to you like a lamb for the slaughter not
[55:41] trying to hide anything from you in any
[55:44] of my nakedness any of my flaws I'm just
[55:48] asking that your word would come like
[55:50] the knife that it is it's sharp it's
[55:54] quick the verse verse 12 said that it
[55:57] would divide soul and spirit even to the
[56:00] marrow of the bone
[56:02] the Word of God discerns the secret
[56:05] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[56:06] and our prayer is Lord I submit I submit
[56:12] to the truth of your word the word of
[56:17] God both cuts sometimes corrects like a
[56:22] crushing hammer burns sometime like a
[56:25] consuming fire but don't you forget my
[56:28] friend the Word of God also heals and
[56:32] mends and puts things back together the
[56:37] spirit Word of God this word of God
[56:40] quickened made alive anointed unveiled
[56:43] to you in relationship can do all of
[56:48] those things it can restore anything
[56:53] that the enemy has stolen from you pray
[56:55] with me father thank you for your word

[57:02] for us the Bible the written record of
[57:05] your word but thank you even more for

[57:11] for coming by your spirit and making
[57:14] your word live in the depth of who we

[57:27] surgery it feels like but thank you Lord
[57:30] also that your word heals renews
[57:33] restores builds us up and we just pray
