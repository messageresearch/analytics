[0:00] this good holy ghost is not an
[0:03] it it's not a thing
[0:08] he is a person the eternal
[0:11] spirit of the father
[0:18] [Music]
[0:20] that great pillar of fire that led the
[0:23] children of israel through the
[0:25] wilderness
[0:26] has now showed up in jerusalem
[0:30] at shavuot time or pentecost time
[0:35] and instead of being one single
[0:38] pillar of fire he has divided himself
[0:42] like cloven tongues of fire and it's
[0:45] sitting on top of their heads
[0:48] what is that it was the pillar of fire
[0:51] it was god in that spirit
[0:55] form manifesting himself
[0:58] in a visible way this good holy ghost
[1:02] is not an it it's
[1:05] not a thing he is a person
[1:09] the eternal spirit of the father
[1:13] the same spirit that dwelts
[1:16] in the body of our lord jesus christ
[1:20] and if that same spirit that raised
[1:23] jesus from the dead if that same
[1:26] spirit by resurrection dwell in you it
[1:29] shall also
[1:30] make alive it shall also quicken
[1:33] your mortal body it came in by
[1:36] introduction
[1:37] of what sounded like a rushing mighty
[1:41] wind
[1:42] as they were gathered in one mind and
[1:44] one accord
[1:46] they began to stagger around like drunk
[1:49] men
[1:50] and peter remember
[1:53] failure peter
[1:57] betrayer peter the one who denied
[2:01] that he even knew the lord here is
[2:05] someone who has been told
[2:07] the church is going to be built on a
[2:10] revelation
[2:11] that you will receive from the lord but
[2:14] we know that
[2:15] peter was a reed jesus talked to him
[2:18] about being a reed
[2:20] who was transformed into a rock
[2:23] what i want you to know is the same
[2:25] peter just a few days before
[2:28] was embarrassed to tell the dishwashing
[2:31] lady
[2:32] that he knew jesus but now he had been
[2:35] at the upper
[2:36] room at the right place at the right
[2:39] time
[2:39] with the right middle attitude and he
[2:42] had received the holy ghost
[2:45] into his life and the reed became a rock
[2:49] because as they were standing around
[2:51] saying hey
[2:52] why are these men drunk so early in the
[2:55] morning
[2:55] peter stood up and remember too ashamed
[2:59] to be associated with jesus a few weeks
[3:02] before
[3:03] but now he stands up in front of the
[3:05] whole crowd and he said
[3:06] all you men of galilee these men
[3:10] are not drunk like ye suppose
[3:13] but this is that which was spoken of by
[3:16] the prophet
[3:17] joel in the last days i will pour out my
[3:21] spirit upon all flesh so peter
[3:25] received an infusion really a
[3:28] personality change
[3:30] and a personal change when he
[3:33] experienced
[3:34] god in him by the power
[3:37] of the holy ghost and you will too
[3:41] you will too and if you haven't you must
