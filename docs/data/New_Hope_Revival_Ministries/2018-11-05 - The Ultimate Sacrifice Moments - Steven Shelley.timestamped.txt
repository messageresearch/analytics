[0:13] and here's the bigger question can you
[0:16] identify your life your circumstances
[0:21] your sin your condition where you are
[0:24] now can you look to that cross and
[0:27] identify that Jesus Christ has made the
[0:31] ultimate sacrifice for your sins and if
[0:35] you are willing to confess your sin if
[0:38] you're willing to repent of your sin
[0:41] then you have every right to the
[0:44] redemptive work that he accomplished on
[0:47] your behalf on that cross his sacrifice
[0:51] is yours his offering is yours the price
[0:55] he paid is your price and by that and
[0:59] because of that we can have eternal life
[1:02] I realize there are people who go years
[1:06] in church who attend church for years
[1:09] and they never come to that place where
[1:11] they can fully identify that the work
[1:14] that was accomplished on that cross was
[1:16] for me if I would have been the only one
[1:19] he would have done that just for me
