under the Tabernacle is at somewhat of a stand still because the air conditioner lines need to be put in the walls and so forth before that we can move forward with sheetrocking anything insulating anything and so it's just kind of at a standstill um right now there's right around $113,000 in the account and we need somewhere around 24 25,000 to get the air conditioning systems in I know that the Lord has that and I know that he will provide it I've seen him already doing it this week we're thankful for every offering that comes in uh some of you may not have heard but there was somewhat of a catastrophe at my house this week uh while we were away and uh uh it it it's amazing how God does work my wife bought some cherries for Shana set them on the countertop and told Nathan to go get them he forgot to do it on Wednesday and went in on Thursday and was met by a flood the filter under my sink the reverse osmosis filter one of the canisters broke and water was going everywhere he pumped out about 90 gallons of water I have a pump in under the floor it's hard to tell how much it pumped out uh and so uh our kitchen is is a wreck right now but uh I I'm not at odds about it Joyce is not upset about it she said for about five seconds she was startled dismayed but the Peace of the Lord settled down over us he knows what he's doing and I'm just uh excited to watch how he wants to work and so I just keep moving forward giving him praise and that's what he deserves he deserves the praise he's the one that gave me the house to start with he gave me the grace to pay the mortgage off in 2015 he gives me the money to pay the insurance so that I can call up Alpha Insurance and say I need some help he's the one that gives us all that ability and so I just give him the praise

Brother David man how amazing it is to see you in the house of the Lord today praise God um uh do do you have any idea how large the tumor was well in the picture it sure looked a lot bigger than that didn't it brother has had a tumor removed from his ear this week in Atlanta he was first in a lot of pain but uh he is doing better he looks really good today uh not as dizzy as he certainly was uh how are you how's your pain level great wonderful you're kind of used to pain so uh but we're believing that when the complete uh healing and uh recovery has happened there won't be any left amen let's give God some praise for helping Brother David and and have having give him strength to be in the house of the Lord it's so wonderful he sent a text on Friday and said the Lord willing I plan to be at church on Sunday and that was real encouraging to hear we're just thankful uh sister Rebecca Goss today is your birthday day now I don't have the year I only have the day in the month but I have connection so I can get it if I need it for my notes but I will just suffice to say all I have to do usually is go back to Facebook because somebody normally will will call you out but I want to say to her uh and have the whole church to say to her happy birthday today God bless you Sister amen [Applause] I'm only mentioning that because I was working on the birthday calendar yesterday that we can give out to you so that you will have everybody's birthday and use it as a prayer prayer request sheet because if you if you will just pray for someone on their birthday a little extra that'll be a great gift to them and a great blessing then you can shoot them a text and say happy birthday I'm praying extra for you today how many of you appreciate getting a text like that that to know somebody's thinking about you and praying for you of course you know gift cards and stuff like that that's always appreciated too but prayer prayer is what we really need more than anything else and uh so today is also uh Janna and Benjamin's second wedding anniversary today I think they're going to make it they've made it this far I believe they're going to make it happy anniversary I can tell you right now my week coming up is going to look a whole lot different than my week has looked for the last five weeks tomorrow she'll be six weeks old I think and I have spent at least a portion of every day holding her and her Nana has spent a portion of the day holding her praying over her and uh I've tried to be faithful to tell her every day that Jesus loves her and I just go down the list and I always get Jenna's mom and dad in there too grahams and Chief and and as uh sad as I'm going to be not having them around this week I am that much thrilled for her parents and her grandparents that they're going to get to see her and enjoy her this week Jenna's grandfather is 91 will he be 90 91 I think this year grandmother is 80 or 81 and they're coming they're going to pick them up and bringing them from Arkansas to Dallas and the family's going to be together and they deserve their they deserve their chance and their opportuni so I feel like sharing right now maybe about Wednesday I may not feel like sharing but it is what it is may God give them safety as they as they travel I think that was all for today uh tomorrow is uh a a birthday that I remember every year uh it is the birthday of a mentor of mine an example to me in Ministry uh who has gone to be with the Lord some many years ago now but brother Perry green was born in uh 33 I think it was on July the 1st and he would have been 91 I think 9 1 years old if he would have still been with us and I usually remember it make a little post or something and I remember something brother brandham said to him personally many years ago in about 64 or five he said brother Perry that n that one in your birthday July 1st that one in your birthday means that you're good at starting things and you know brother green never forgot that and so uh when it came time to start the work in Tucson he was utilizing that one in his birthday and he liked to mention that to us so many times and I can't forget it Tuesday is sister Mimi I mean alita's birthday she's Mimi to a lot of us hold up your hand there's some that might not know who you are let's say happy birthday to Sister Alita she's a few years older than she was when I first met her many years ago but I would have to say that she is crowned with glory and beauty and she gets around and labors and drives a school bus and uh she doesn't act her age you know that's the truth and and it's a blessing from the Lord to be in that position so we love her and we wish her happy birthday sister Jeffrey you don't you don't I mean you're a little younger there than but you don't act your age either and you certainly don't look your age and um I say that because I've known both of you ladies a long time hold up your hands so everybody can see Tuesday is also sister jeffy's birthday and we want to say God bless you Thursday is July the 4th we call it the birthday of our nation so to speak and sister Beverly shares uh a birthday not the year not 1776 than I don't know that'd be kind of a miracle wouldn't it God's able to do a lot of things so she's not she certainly doesn't share the year but she does share the day uh sister Beverly skipworth's birthday is on July the 4th happy birthday to [Applause] you Friday is Sister Kendra ellsworth's birthday and I don't think you ought to even be mentioned if you're not here but I'm going to mention her happy birthday to her if they get a chance to catch this service at any time she'll know that we're thinking about her and Brother David Gosman streaming the service today in Indiana your birthday is Friday too I'm not going to ask you how old you are I'm just going to say happy birthday brother and God bless you we appreciate you all being on the other end of the stream let's thank God for Brother David and his wife we have saints who are streaming this morning we don't have any way of knowing from how many places uh South there's a couple places in South America I see Niger and Zambia and um I saw earlier Norway and several other places let me just glance here um the United Kingdom Norway sister Hannah we're praying for you I know you've got a surgery coming up in Norway we're believing God to be with you Gana West Africa and it just goes on South Africa God bless you all you can't be here with us physically but we're thankful that you're connected with us through the internet we have been doing that so long we we out we predate the internet uh that's the truth and we used to do it with a telephone hookup and people would call in and brother brother Wallace had these little boxes and maybe brother Williams might have helped on some of that we had these little boxes that you flip flip a switch and maybe brother TBO was it brother TBO that did something in that too so that we could put people on hold but instead of putting them on hold they got to hear what was going on in the service and we did that for many years until the internet began to open up and now we have the blessing of being able to stream anywhere that someone can get a signal and we hear back we hear every week from people who are blessed and touched and helped and we want to give the go the glory to God it doesn't belong to us let's stand and while we're standing let's thank the Lord for these amazing musicians and Benjamin leading the worship and oh we just appreciate it we want to believe God to move in Indiana May the Lord just move and use brother gy and if if things were a little different we'd all just shut this place down Sunday and we'd all go and because those people have been so faithful to fellowship with us these last three or so years maybe going on four now I don't remember exactly and they come by the droves and uh this is this is an opportunity and some of the folks are going to go and we're going to miss you it's going to be a little little emptier here next Sunday we had to kind of work around because we got musicians leaving and worship leaders leaving and so forth but you know the Lord will be here and if you're in town please be here and bring your biggest amen and help us move through amen all right let's look to the word of God today we'll just let you uh uh keep standing for a moment and then uh you can have your seat let's go to Philippians that's in the New Testament chapter 3 Philippians 3 and I'm just going to read for now seven verses my message this morning is a continuation of where we were uh Sunday morning and Tuesday night we call that oh yes you can and you can because greater is he that is in you it's not me that's great it's the one who lives in me that's great amen and that makes me an overcomer certainly does and this morning I'm going to take it a step further and the message would be called press against and press in we're pressing this is a pressing hour the Bible talks about an age when we would be pressed on every hand and the pressure of life around us and politics and you know sickness and whatever else is kind of pressing in family responsibilities Etc sort of press in and if you don't press back you'll you'll implode if you just lay there and let life walk all over you without calling on your help you see I know where my help comes from and I will lift like the I'll lift my eyes toward the Hills from which cometh my help my help comes from the Lord my Creator my maker amen if you don't press back you'll implode and so there's something that we press against and there's something that we press into and we've got to do it at the same time there there's no time to do one and then the other we have to do both at the same time we're pressing the darkness back and we're pressing into to the promise amen Philippians 3 but what things were gained to me those I counted loss for Christ yay doubtless and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord I want to pause and remind you that this knowledge is not a head knowing it's not a head knowledge it's a relational knowledge you only gain the knowledge of Christ Jesus as Lord by having fellowship and relationship with him you understand you can hear all the good preaching and you can hear all the good things about him and be very acquainted with him in in in head knowledge in information but by Revelation is how we gain this kind of a knowledge it comes by having some participation and as the New Testament says cooperation with him so this knowledge is worth pursuing the Apostle said for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung that I may win Christ the the whole life of the apostle was changed when he met the Lord and he was most learned among the religious and all of his religion he had to lay aside to have a relationship with Jesus Christ he said all that training all that effort all that stuff I've gone through it's nothing it's just loss and listen at this verse and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law a Pharisee of the Pharisees but that which is through the Faith of Christ I like it he didn't say faith in Christ he said the Faith of Christ you think that little small preposition doesn't matter it changes the whole meaning of the phrase and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the Faith of Christ that is an imparted faith that is not a faith that you muster yourself it's a faith that is given to you granted to you it's not faith in Christ but it's his faith that's been given to you as a gift the righteousness which is of god by by faith we can never get good enough he said that I may know him again not information by intimacy that I may know him and the power of his resurrection that I may experience the dunamis the dynamite of who he is in his resurrection power and the fellowship of his sufferings now remember we're entering into Fellowship with his sufferings because he suffered on our behalf being made conformable moldable pliable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead a future promise not as though I had already attained either were already perfect but I follow after if if that I may apprehend which means to lay hold on that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus the Apostle is saying that I may arrest the very force that has arrested me come on that I may grab hold of take hold of the very thing that has first taken hold of me and that that is Christ Jesus Oh Hallelujah Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing let's say it one thing one thing one thing so many things to do but Paul said I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do hello what's he say next forgetting those those things which are behind and woo unto those things which are before I'm forgetting those things that are behind me and I am reaching toward those things that are mine they're mine they're promised to me and here is the last verse I press I press toward the Mark it's like a race we're pressing toward you remember get on your mark get set go that's the starting Mark but there's a finishing Mark how many of you know there's an end to this race the Apostle said I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus do you know what your prize is in knowing that you've been called by Christ Jesus to be called of him is the greatest prize that anybody could ever attain and in reality he is the prize he is the prize so let's read that together before we're seated I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus father we thank you today for your presence in this room we are here to lift up your name to glorify you you are king of kings and Lord of lords anoint our ears and our hearts to both hear and receive this message today let it not be a message from from the preacher may it be a message from your throne Lord may we speak today as with the oracle of God speak to your people and encourage your people and help us to get back on the race if we have in some way stumbled From the Path and we'll give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the church said amen you may be seated now because we're continuing this series just a little bit we're still talking about taking the promised land and we read both Sunday and Tuesday night about those spies that were called of God leaders from all of the 12 tribes of the children of Israel one chosen out of every tribe to go and represent as spies a as uh those who would go before for Runners who would go into the land of promise and check it out God's already said on the other side of that river is yours I'm giving you that good land but you know nobody wants to to to go in and not have any idea what you're going to meet once you get over there and so this was a brilliant plan uh but it didn't go so well in reality because 10 came back with gripes gripes bellyaches and complaints we like to say negative reports but what did the Bible call it an evil report a and anything contrary to God's promise in your life is an evil report if the devil accuses you or lays something to your charge that's against what God's word has said about you as a spirit fill believer then we know that's not just a negative word from hell but it's an evil report and he'll talk to your mind won't he and he'll make you suspicious of each other even that's how he works in the last days so 10 came back with gripes and two Joshua and Caleb they came back with grapes now you got to put yourself in there somewhere if you'd have been one of those spies wouldn't you like to think that you'd have been one of those who came back with grapes but kn what you know about yourself knowing what you know about yourself you tell me see because how you conduct yourself with your own situation now is how you would have conducted yourself then and if it's easier this is no condemnation brother because we're all working to the same inheritance pushing oursel so this is not to make anybody feel bad it is to try to make you check up a little bit and make sure that you are believing the report of the Lord instead of the report of your circumstances is that okay so if everything that happens to you you know you're always looking at the worst side worst case scenario you know I I always see maybe you see the the glasses half empty and someone else comes along and says well that glass is half full it's the same glass same amount of liquid but it matters how you look at things and so how you look at your life what you heard brother gy share this morning in his own testimony about this flood that came to their house it hasn't been so many years ago on July the 4th that we were enjoying a barbecue at our house and we had a flood that caused our uh hardwood floor to have to be replaced a bathroom to be made uh you know redone and so forth and Etc and you've been through similar kinds of situations ours drug out for three years but in the end God was glorified and it turned out brother gy came almost immediately sister Joyce had just a few tiny moments of wow and then their their testimony quickly became Lord uh you knew this we didn't know it was going to happen you knew it and you must already have a plan somebody needs a witness somebody needs to come in our home and be witnessed to and uh maybe you didn't like the color of the floor as good as you thought you did to start with or the quality of the product and God's making away there's all the all these kind so we could look at how horrible that is all that water and my wife said when she heard she said water can be so damaging water the Bible said so water it can cause so much damage and there's so much to to lament about uh when you're when you're looking at cabinets and so forth but they decided you heard it they decided to say this is but an opportunity somewhere in this will come out ahead and God will be glorified in our testimony if you're the that kind of a person I I'm not just elevating them but I do love them respect their leadership and want them to know it but if you're that kind of a person you'd have probably been one of the two that came back with grapes but if you're the kind of person that sees every hardship as a Warfare from hell and Satan's trying to kill you and it must be a demon at work I mean I believe in all those things but if that's the first thing you see H then you're more likely to bring a report that God doesn't get any glory in I want to remind you church that our God is greater than our enemy in every way in every way God's word defeats his enemy a and the one that has set out to destroy your life is already def defeated and if we'll stop agreeing with him he has to tuck tail the Bible said submit yourselves therefore unto God resist the devil and you don't have to run from him what's the word say he'll flee from you and I believe that with all my heart so I don't know what you would have done then you may not perhaps know but you're presented with an opportunity now moving forward toward the end of your destiny to to make sure that the report you give is one that says God is bigger than my problem he's bigger than my circumstance one of the great uh Spurgeon perhaps or or one of the greats used to say don't look at the bigness of your problem but rather look at the bigness of your God it's not easy to do that in the Heat of the Moment we've all been in those situations but when we choose to agree with the Lord in his word then we give a good report the best we can maybe our voice is trembling you know maybe we don't feel very strong but we're holding on to faith and giving God an opportunity to work don't shut God out of your circumstances let him in and let him have his way to his glory and so uh you know it it got serious because in the end those 10 couldn't go in and their descendants some of their descendant weren't allowed to go in in fact a whole generation had to die before they could really be taken into the inheritance that God had promised them so it was another trip around the mountain come on here comes Kadesh Baria again going to see it again and again and again until we agree with what the word said then we can go straight into the promise it's coming it's coming your promise is not as far away now as it was yesterday every day you wait for it every day you T for it in faith brings it one day closer if you spend the day in turmoil without faith you really push you push the promise you push the promise a little further out in the future somebody said you do that by your faith and your report well according to the word you do I'm just telling you what the book said so let's get let's get a few quotations here that will finish up that part of this message in a message called Redemption by judgment brother brandom is preaching at home and in paragraph 27 he says now Israel come up to Kadesh or Kadesh Baria and here they come back and Joshua and Caleb this is paragraph 27 of redemption by judgment 54 and Joshua and Caleb they were really all fired up this is the LA the excuse me this is the quotation right after the last one that we did on Tuesday evening uh Joshua and Caleb they were all fired up they must have had a prayer meeting over there a Revival of some sort among themselves and when they come back here's what their report said yes yes we can take it now brother brandham seemed to think the prayer meeting made the difference how many of you know it will you okay fellas before we go back let us pray a little bit and see if we can get leadership on what to say I believe that was a good plan I believe it' be a good plan in your life as well the rest just came back and they made up I mean they just exaggerated the situation remember they said the land swallows up its inhabitants and everyone there is a giant that was an exaggeration one family of Giants and so we have no possibility no chance of overcoming them but two little men had a prayer meeting on the way back and by the time they got there they were excited enough to say oh yes it's not all pleasant but we can take the land and now we don't have to go through another 40 years of training we could take it right now if we just move in can you not find that one all right but the other 10 said oh no we we can't we can't do that it's just too much for us he said see that's a lack of faith listen Christian everything everything everything is based on on faith when your faith is not enough he has Faith the faith of God the Faith of Christ that he'll pour out on you it comes as a super sense of faith it comes as a gift of faith remember everybody has Faith the Bible said to every every man is given a Measure of Faith and the more you use your faith like a muscle the stronger it becomes but there is a faith there is another faith that you can't work up to I don't care how much you use your faith muscle there is a faith in God a faith excuse me a faith of God a Faith of Christ that he imparts to us as a super sense as a gift and when that comes I want you to know the circumstances they don't matter because God said so and that settles it so brother brandom said here everything is based on faith and faith cannot be right unless it's got something to be based on you see your faith is not based on circumstance your faith is based on the inspired word of God Amen you can have faith and say well I believe that this is my belief you ever been that wishy-washy well you know I believe that God can you know I don't know if he will or not I'm not sure what God will I don't know but you know I I just have some thought I mean this thought comes to my mind that maybe maybe God will help me come on that's not the kind of Faith it's going to take to get through the Giants and get to the promise we're going to have to have more than a hope so we're going to have to have a noo and the only way to have that is a Believers to receive the fullness of the bap ISM of the Holy Ghost when the fullness of the holy spirit is yours it anoints everything you got it's supercharges everything you've got so it's not enough to say well I believe that this is my belief my belief is no good if it's contrary to God's belief there's something more important than my belief but if my belief tallies if it measures up lines up with his then I got a foundation that is solid no matter what takes place we're just going to go anyhow cause God you believe the Lord will help you cuz God said so do you believe he's able to touch and help your body cuz God said so he's able now that's the type of faith that Caleb and Joshua had the kindest base on a solid foundation now in the message the Easter seal uh paragraph 171 and forgive me for so many references this morning men and women it'll take you uh uh it'll make you stand to your feet it'll make you do the things that God wants you to do I don't care what somebody else says about it the neighbor said oh that person has lost their mind pray all night read the Bible you you do realize you're surrounded by people who think you're crazy there's people watching this service right now by chance it seems they didn't plan to be watching it and they're looking around and they're thinking that's a craziest bunch of people waving their hands and and and and jumping around like a war dance and somebody's waving a flag or something in there those people are off their rocker I I think it's good for you to know how people look at you you is that going to discourage you are you going to come in here Tuesday night with your hands folded sir no sir we're going to come in praising God because the Bible tells us how to praise him so I don't care what they say it's what God called you to do that's right oh they say we can't have these oldfashioned Pentecostal revivals oh oh oh yes we can too hello you can have it it doesn't matter whether your church is having one or not you can have one in yourself remember when the spies went over to the United Kingdom to see what was going on in in in the excuse me in Wales during the Welch Revival where The Jeffy brothers were were ministering and they couldn't find their way you know they've been on a boat for for we don't know how long they finally get there they don't know where Wales is they're trying to find it somewhere in London looking for Wales which is uh a pretty piece on down the road to the South and they they come across a police officer what they call a Bobby and he's standing on a little platform in the in the intersection of the road with a whistle you know and he's directing traffic they walk right out in the street and said excuse me sir can you tell us where the wel Revival is we've come from America to experience the Welsh Revival he said oh that's easy it's right here I can give you directions to Wales and you can experience what I've experienced there but if you're looking for the Revival it's standing right here before you I believe that I believe that Revival is a personal individual experience with the Lord and you ought to be having Revival if everybody around you is licking their wounds and eating worms you ought to be having a Revival why because God's word gives us the right he never fails oh yes we can too you can have it in yourself and you are the have you ever felt alone have you ever felt like you you were a lone ship in the middle of a big sea and nobody even knew where you were and you've been lost for ages and nobody has even come looking for you and the motor is gone and the boat is a drift hello oh and you're in the minority by yourself like Elijah the prophet when he would run in from a woman named Jezebel you ever felt that way didn't you realize friend that with God in God you are not a minority you are never alone when you're in God when you're in Christ let me tell you about that being alone you can be in a crowded room and be alone so we're not looking just for for companionship or Fellowship we're looking for the reality that we are a majority when we stand in God when we stand on the word we're not a shrinking minority one God the Old Church of God hymn one God and man I think the words were probably one man and God but I like the other way around one God and man can Triumph or a thousand one God in man put Satan on the run one woman and God is a majority not a minority no matter what the rest of them think we're not even asking anybody else whether they think we can make it or not we're not even asking anybody else if they think that we can come all the way to full adoption and sunship doesn't matter what you think anybody with me oh no matter what the rest of them think then he goes on in wisdom versus faith and he says then if Jesus defeated Satan upon the faith knowing who he was he was a predestinated creature are you ready amen the congregation said amen he said what about the predestinated Bride of Jesus Christ now now today the word predestination has become a curse word in the in the modern Church World especially in the modern Pentecostal Church world they're they're so scared of it because all that's ever been presented to many of them is an extreme form of predestination like the Primitive Baptist used to preach if a man goes out and takes a a gun and and puts a bullet in another man's head they said Lord well he was predestinated to do that now that's wrong that's not what the book said we're not talking about predestinated to do evil things although there is some reality to that because if you don't make the right choice that's right you don't make the how many of you glad you made God your choice and evidently you did it in eternity because the Bible said uh you didn't choose me before you could ever choose me I saw your choice and i cho by my for knowledge I saw your choice and I chose you that's what the word said he said what about the predestinated Bride of Jesus Christ now you believe the bride is predestined I sure do I sure do believe it the predestinated bride of Christ now the church the word seed with everything that God promised to put in the church what after the next fellowship meeting when we come to camp meeting no it's in us now yes no wonder he kept selling the people everything you need to make the Rapture it's in you now we're just waiting on the Holy Spirit to come and brood over that promise and start bringing it out Hallelujah a death has to take place to release the germ that germ of life that's in the seed it has to die so that the life can be Rel the old hole the old Shell anybody ever recognize you had an Old Shell an old hole about you that had to crack woo come on somebody said well that's just a crack poot that's okay as long as it was the shell that cracked so that the life can come forth oh yes he said everything God promised to put in the church in it right now it's in it now everything is in order you see that's in spirit realm in spirit realm everything is in order right now we just have to come into alignment in the natural realm with what Spirit realm already knows you do understand you're a dual being you're really a Triune being aren't you but we say duel because there's an inner man and an outer man that's two the inner man is made up of Soul and Spirit the outer man is made up of Flesh body come on and you're really of Heaven you're of Eternity and you're of Earth just like Adam was Adam was made from the dust of the earth he was earthy or Earthly we might say but that that was placed within him was not of planet Earth it was not of the creation at all it was breath it was breath it was Spirit breath hello it was Spirit life and God breathed into Adam Adam man and he became a living Soul his inner man began to form that which would connect him between th those two Realms so remember that in the realm of the spirit I hope that doesn't sound too Hocus Pocus it's New Testament theology by the way but what what's what we need to remember is we're running in parallel dimensions are parallel Realms right now the natural running parallel with the spiritual and that's how we see often times the natural types the spiritual well let me tell you something it works the other way too the spiritual can often be a type of the natural it works both ways there's things going on in your life in the natural because God wants to do something for you in the spirit what's happening over here doesn't look very spiritual it's not very spiritual to be sick it's not very spiritual to have bad uh situations on your job it's not very spiritual but but let me tell you something what's going on in this natural realm can often be an indicator and and here's what God does what Satan meant to take you out God allowed because it's going to take you over and we're born to overcome come on I don't know if you caught this or not but last Sunday we said something about overcoming getting over the mountain and there was a a statement that came that I really liked it wasn't premeditated and that is there are certain mountains you can't speak to on this side you got to get over them to be able to turn then and speak to them with authority brother brandom said it's not more power the church needs it's more Authority and it's not more Authority I want to take that one step further it's not more Authority that the church needs it's to recognize that all the authority that we need it's in it now yes sir you see so we're not waiting on more authority to drop down we're waiting to recognize whose authority is within us the authority of Jesus Christ the first part of the creation of God brother if he's backing you up if you've got the word backing you up you don't have to be afraid of a family of giants that's right you don't have to be afraid of somebody trying to intimidate you on your job you don't have to be afraid of peer pressure at school if you know that you know that you know you're part of him the Bible tells us that those who know their God shall be what strong and do what exploits amazing demonstrations of God's character power and authority exploits there's a bride in the earth positioning by the spirit now getting in sync with our marching orders that are not of Earth they're not earthy they're coming from another place they're coming from an eternal realm and we're discovering that it's important for us to get in synchronization alignment with what the spirit is saying remember that before God speaks prophetically to the church ages he says hear what the spirit yes sir is saying to the church so the hearing choosing to hear is part of the alignment so now on that rare occasion that I stir somebody up excuse me just a moment on that rare occasion you know what I'm telling you something I don't know why anybody any woman anywhere would want to shave her eyebrows and paint them on it's going to get quiet now I don't know why eyebrows are such a blessing they catch the sweat did you know I finally had to stop a minute because this eyebrow was so full of sweat it was spilling over but just think about somebody that perspires like me how it would be if my eyebrows weren't there Catchings isn't God good I know you're looking at me like you've lost it ain't God good and yet some women you know ever never I'm just holing this preacher and I can't help it come on just can't help it but anyway thank God for eyebrows what' your preacher preach on Sunday thank God for eyebrows if that's all you get that's all you get all right everything is in order he said the Holy Spirit has been given the seed back to the quote the seed has been swed the evening lights has been shining the sign of Sodom that Jesus Promised is here and Malachi 4 a predestinated church God kept his word he sent a forerunner to to hail to announce the first coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and he sent a forerunner a prophet to hail to announce to declare the second coming of Jesus Christ is at hand and who would hear a predestinated church one who made the right choice one who said I'm going to stay with the word popular or not I'm going to stay with the book all right are you got a little more in you good in the message perseverant faith fath faith will always admit the word right it's right the word is right now you know the church today they can't say the word is right in many situations because they're too busy saying that's not what it means you know Dr Google you know what who I'm talking about Dr Google has made a lot of Physicians out of nobodies out of wnab bees and people will tell you what's wrong you don't even need the Holy Spirit gift when you're praying for people anymore because they already know everything that's wrong with them because they've already dror Googled it come on and so modern technology has made everybody a doctor and they know how to treat themselves and diagnose themel and modern technology has made everybody a uh an armchair Theologian and you know what they'll say in Hebrew it says in Greek it says and you know what you you you got to do a little better than that because if you look at the English you'll find out that there may be multiple words that are translated in English one way a and and in Hebrew it may be one of three or four different words and you say it doesn't matter it matters if you're getting to the nitty-gritty right and so you know we we're I'm not trained I'm not trying to say I am but here's what I'll tell you I don't need anybody to tell me what the word doesn't mean you don't need a modern church that tell you the Bible don't mean that that's not what that scripture means what we need is Holy Ghost we need Holy Spirit to help guide and direct us somebody said well we've got the message and that's the absolute and I would just say to you which one which sermon is the absolute because if a if a teaching is presented in two different ways only one of them can be the absolute so what the bride has had to discover is we have the Bible as our ultimate absolute and anything else that God gives us prophetically by whoever it is it has to line up it has to line up with that word so you know we're better off than most because we've got a book to go to we've got a manual to go to and if you're not one of those armchair theologians trying to talk yourself out of what it means but you're allowing the Holy Spirit to take the message of the hour Quicken it to you and then you go back and see where it fits right down in there good and tight with the book with the Bible with the word of God you can whip any devil any time under any circumstances because you've got an absolute how many of you are thankful for it faith will always admit the word right whether your pastor says so or not whether anybody else says so or not your faith says it right Glory your faith says it right so when she was called even by Jesus Christ the one she come to and he rebuked her this is a story in the gospels a and look at his disciple the men was with him in his campaigns said oh beat it sometimes somebody that you want to push out is just looking for what you got that's right it ain't easy sometime putting up with folks but sometimes we got let God just have his way it's not easy I struggle I don't do very well but I tell you I don't want to be guilty of telling this woman get out of here go beat it get out when she's there to touch His Garment when she's there to get a hold of him for help remember if you know the story Jesus had gone up into right across what we would Now call the northern border of Israel in what we would now classify as Lebanon he went right up into to the north on a little holiday the Bible said so he pulled away to get some rest and so the disciples were trying to help him and protect him and God blessed them for doing that but this woman wasn't there to agitate him she had a daughter that was grievously vexed with the devil and she didn't want to trouble the master she just wanted one word from him that would set her daughter free this can all be done in about 60 seconds that's all she wanted but the disciples didn't understand and they said oh beat it get out of here you're annoying us don't bother our Master oh my my so so they that didn't stop her no sir nothing is going to stop her cuz she's got faith it's going to happen anyhow and remember he even insulted her oh my the Lord insulted her and he reminded her that this was that this was this healing was for for the children and and and not for the dogs the Gentiles this was for the children oh he tried to somehow see where her faith really was and she submitted she admitted that he was right and I'm nothing but a dog remember what she said she said truth Lord you're mighty right but even the little dogs and and that word dogs that she used there is not a word for a German Shepherd or a Great Dane or a bulldog or a Rottweiler or a pitbull that word that's used there is a word for a little yelping agitating something like a chihuahua I hope I don't offend you I know there's a lot of Taco Bell fans here and I don't want to offend you on the Chihuahua but that's the only one I can think there's worse I'm sure there's worse oh the dog lovers are are are are going to mutiny here in a minute I feel him coming I mean I say if you're going to have a dog be like sister Kathy have a dog she's got a dog she's got a pony but but the kind of dog that's being talked about here is those little dogs that just yep yep yep yep yep yep and she said truth Lord but even those little yeling dogs they stick around and catch the crumbs woo that fall from the rich man's table oh Jesus was impressed with her now wasn't he he said I've never seen such great faith not in all of Israel here you are a gentile she said I'm nothing but a dog I don't deserve anything but Lord let me bring something to your memory I'm not after the bread I just want a few crumbs I don't need what belongs to somebody else Lord just give me a little porion of what you have woo I'm just after some crumbs anybody like that you've got to be like that woman you got to be like the woman who press through the crowd and Touch the Hem of His Garment she touched the zit Zed of His Garment H took a hold of it and was instantly made whole though many years she had tried many Physicians and here was a woman that we just mentioned who had a look when you get home everything is going to be all right your daughter is well from this moment it's going to take you a little while to get back to where she is when you get there you're going to find that your faith oh help me preach your faith has touched the master I want that kind of faith I want to be one of them little yeling dogs if I have to be if I'm not blessed enough to be a great dane or a great greyhound or something Noble Lord let me be a chiuahua around your table if I don't deserve the fine meat that some of the message brothers and sisters get to eat if all all I can have is just a few of these leftover crumbs as long as they come from you it'll be everything that I have need of we're not nearly hungry enough for Jesus come on we're not nearly hungry enough for the word and that's why we fill our lives with so many other forms of entertainment and emulations and competitions and hello it's not enough to be a crazy football fan we got to be a fantasy football fan it's not enough it goes on and on and on it's not enough to have a PlayStation or Lord of Mercy I almost said Atari I remember my first video game I ever saw was tennis nothing but a beep and mo we thought we had broken into modern technology now you don't even have to have those big consoles you can play it all day on your phone nothing wrong with something to get your mind off of some stuff but let me remind you that there's nothing that can take the place when the bride takes an opportunity to Feast on the word word of God for the hour it is the truth it is the truth and I'm not taking it back I'm not taking it back the trouble of it is now we don't have people H to Humble themselves to get some crumbs I didn't get in the line that don't make any difference I just come to see if he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm after some crumbs that preacher didn't lay hands on me he didn't call me out and tell me I needed Deliverance let me tell you something the little bride don't wear her feelings on her sleeves I wish brother Shel have more prayer line I wish he'd pray for more he used to do that years ago yes and I I will when we should I will when we should but in this hour in the absence of that we're not beyond that or past that but in the absence of that you just don't you do without don't you could dare do without the master's table is full and if you don't find your invitation to sit at the table just be one of those little Chihuahuas Minature somethings teacup somethings and get you some of those crumbs you've never had a crumb taste like his crumbs somebody said you know you go back and read all them old quotes you know 50 years ago all that stuff just you know can't you just go let me tell you something if it fell from the master's table it doesn't have an expiration date if it equipped a generation ago to overcome it'll equip you to overcome you got to give your life to it in that message the the maniac of gadara he said you can completely submit yourself to the Holy Ghost and no Affliction can hold you I want that you I want that you walk by the power of the Holy Ghost you are well you give your testimony everything else you're healed by the power of the Holy Ghost you that sinful that may be drinking smok and gambl and do things like that you'd say I can't give them up brother brandom yes you can you just submit yourself to God one time yield your whole self to God keep doing it well I tried that and it just worked for a little short while you stop giving him your all and the enemy crept in he'll put a creeper yes l in your life on anybody here sir he'll put a creeper in your life he'll let one of them little Vines come up and squeeze out the life he wants to drag you back to the life you came from oh but if you'll Feast on the word and get under the presence of the Holy Ghost he'll give you what you need he said that's the whole thing just submit yourself to God there's no secret in it it's not a Hocus Pocus the only thing it is submit yourself to God I believe that with all my heart and he goes on I'm not going to read some of those I want you to go with me to Ephesians for the moment that we have left it's uh 1:00 and I know some of you visiting and you may not know that we don't have a Sunday night service so we go to the 2:00 hour usually if you need to slip out then you slip out we're certainly blessed to have you with us we won't take it personal or be offended but we're not going to rush for you that wouldn't be pleasing to the Lord but we do understand that you may have left a roast in the crock pot in the oven crockpot safer in the oven it'll be about that big when we get through it'll shrink right up Ephesians 6:12 for we wrestle not for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places remember we're talking about that other world that other spiritual realm it's not only a realm of light but there's a Realm of Darkness over there some people don't believe in a literal hell well I want you to know there is such a place and there's a literal devil it's not just a concept he's a created being he had a beginning and he has an ending that's right and you you're an overcomer we're not wrestling against people we're wrestling against an unseen Army principalities Powers rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high place so we got to press against it so we're pressing against something principalities we're pressing against Powers we're pressing against the rulers of the darkness of this world we're pressing against spiritual wickedness in high places but we're not only called to press against something we're called to press into something and Philippians 4:13 it's a small verse but it sure says a lot I can do I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me it's just up a little bit in the note I can do all things through Christ who strengtheneth me now Look at Philippians 4:13 in the Amplified he said I have strength for all things in Christ who owers me oo yes I am ready for anything and equal to anything through him who infuses are you hearing this I started to say a moment ago in that rare occasion when I call to you pay attention maybe even by name sometime hey hello are you listening to me it's not because I like what I what I say it's because in that moment I'm sensing there's something for you I'm just being honest I don't usually say like this that you don't need to miss I had I had a a horrible situation take place 30 years ago that I've never forgot I had a word from the Lord come to me for a brother who was a guitar player and what I have found is that sometimes people have a tendency to hide behind their instrument and if you do that you will get kind of locked into to one form of worship playing your music and there's more that that's just one of the devic nine different devic demonstrations of Praise in the Bible in the Book of Psalms and don't don't stay locked into one there's a whole ocean out there of other demonstrations of Praise this goes way back to the early 90s for those of you who might possibly misunderstand who I'm referring to this goes way back and it was a Sunday night service and the spirit of the Lord was moving in such a way and a prophetic word began to nabba Bubble it began to Bubble Up I could feel it coming and I turned to deliver it and when I did that deer br brother was as physically present as he could possibly be but every part of who he was other than his physical body was way off somewhere else doing something else than where he should have been and the Lord you don't have to believe I'm going to answer for what I say you're going to answer for what you say the Lord said don't release it some of you were there don't release it he's not in a frame of mind to do anything about it you wait until the right moment I'm still waiting I'm still waiting for the right moment you see it's important that we that we're present sir sir at certain I mean not just physically but spiritually present sometime so that if God wants to speak to us in some way based on what we're experiencing at the moment and he does that we don't want to miss it so if if I and listen when if you're doing something that's distracting others from the presence of the Lord to receive what they have need of you're out of order it doesn't matter what you're talking about or what you're doing you're out of order and you don't want to be distracted because everything is in order in that realm and we're just struggling over here to try to put order together cuz you got all these different kinds of people in a room that come with all their different problems and thoughts and processes and so forth and it's not easy but I'm not looking for the easy Road I never wanted just a church I was look the churches there's enough churches in this County uh that we could never fill them all up when God raised this place up and and many many years ago he didn't raise it up to be another church I know it's a little uncomfortable for some he raised it up for an entirely different P purpose alog together let the church do the church God wanted you doing a little something more than when I say more I mean different of a different kind of nature we're here getting ready for what God's going to do in his people just before Rapture just before blast off come on and listen and how he says it here in the amplifi he said I'm ready for anything and equal to anything through him who I love it infuses oh Jesus the reason why I like that word Infuse is because if power is just poured on you it can roll off off remember the anointing oil remember it was poured on top of Aaron's head ran down his beard ran all the way down to the to the uh to the bottom of his garments and then on the ground that's not what we're looking for a strength that just rolls over us and leaves us or that we leave here on the floor when we leave we're looking for something that infuses us anybody listening something that that that mingles really that's what infusion is it's a mingling it it it's transferring something into you I want it I want it I want that strength the joy of the Lord is my strength I'm more than a conqueror through Christ Jesus if all of if all of my neighbors say we can't take it I don't want to be like them I want to be infused with such a faith of God and a testimony of the word woo that says we can do it not only can we do it we can do it now let's go and that's an infusion he said who infuses Inner Strength into me I am this is a part somebody's going to have a little Quirk with then go read it in the Greek go just oh I can't read Greek then look up every word that's really there in the Greek and see if this is not a pretty accurate extremely accurate uh interpretation of what the original language is saying here I am selfs sufficient oh I know that can't be right I know that can't be right you stop reading that's new age that's new gospel that's water down version oh bless God nothing but 1611 for me and and and don't give me no pocket size King James bless God I will one big enough to beat the devil with you know how religious we can get sometime well let me tell you something you can't beat the Devil with the book don't matter how big it is it's not the printed page that defeats the enemy it's the living Christ in a body declaring the word that's recorded in the book that's how it works but you got to finish reading this he said I am self-sufficient No period there in Christ's which is messia Messiah Christos in the Greek it's the anointed one I am self-sufficient in the anointed ones sufficiency you get it do you get it I can do all things if you stop there you're off the word but King James said I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me the amplifi said I am self-sufficient now if you got a problem with that don't you amen sister flow's [Music] song the next time she sings uh I'll get it in a minute I am that I am uh the line that says uh Jesus talking I did it all by myself I don't need nobody else I did it all by myself I don't need nobody else there's only one who can say that that's the anointed one I didn't need nobody's help I did what I come to do and now I'm living in you you're not sufficient apart from me you can't do it by yourself but when you're in me my sufficiency oh oh yeah then you take what brother random said all that was in the father he emptied into the son and all that was in the son he emptied into the church Hallelujah remember it's not a head knowledge I been with him it's kind of an old uh worldly thing it means I I've laid down with somebody it's going to get very quiet you know the oldtimers used to talk about their days and maybe you didn't get to hear them you didn't miss a whole lot sometime but they're talking about the running around they or alicat days you know then somebody will say my wife is the only one I've ever been with well they don't mean sat in a swing with I know I know I know it's too much for some folks too much for some folk they mean she's the only one I've been intimate with or they might say that gal there she's been with so many she don't know how many she's been with that doesn't mean she's been in a crowd of people it it means she's she's been kind of loose in her choices that that been with is the same as being in Christ it's a not a head knowledge of information it's a knowledge that comes by being with him somebody said that's just too I can't even get my mind there well let me tell you something I didn't write the analogies of the book The the inspirer was the Holy Spirit and he's the one that inspired The Song of Solomon which is not written about a king and his girlfriend it's written about Christ our Heavenly bridegroom and his Earthly bride and it means you've got to go in with him and you've got to be intimate with him you've got to have fellowship with him you've got to love the word more than you love yourself and you've got to not resent the time that you spend behind the veil [Music] so if somebody claps their hands at you and says wake up do it just simply do it I'm thankful through my life for the year for the years of my life when somebody said I'm talking to you boy it never occurred to me to get mad it never occurred to me to get mad it only occurred to me hey better do better next time I'm just being honest now in a me message here we're going to go on and then close how do you do both I don't know in a message in West Palm Beach Florida oh somebody said that sounds nice no it sounds hotter than here right now but in the in the he's telling the testimony of God raising the dead boy in this message but here's at the beginning of the message he he says you've got to go do it and you've got to fight you've got to press against and you've got to press in I got to press against the powers and principalities and rulers of darkness and I've got to press in to my sufficiency that's found in Christ he said you've got to fight for every inch of ground that you have do you believe that every man in here that's born again of the spirit of God knows it you've had to fight where you been for every inch of ground to the mark 1975 when I was but a boy and God filled me with the Holy Ghost it didn't it it wasn't when I heard the message that the battle began the battle began long before I know what I know now 75 God filled me with the Holy Ghost and the battle begins oh yes and every victory has come with a fight and if you're looking for eism if you're looking for Seeker friendly Seeker sensitivity excuse me Seeker sensitive Christianity you're in the wrong house what I got a hold of is a little bit more than just easy pism it's you better fight to keep your head above water because the devil don't care about a half Christian but if you commit to be a real one he knows your address your phone number he knows your strengths and your weaknesses he wouldn't have known your weaknesses but you tell them all day long and he's out to get you greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world just fight fight fight every man in here born again the spirit of God knows that you've had to fight for every inch of ground tow The Mark with Satan that's right isn't that right friends this is not a oh yes everybody loves a good picnic even the ants but this is a this is a Battleground some of you have been having a Battleground with ants because they're coming to find some moisture at your place this is a Battleground see we never come here to eat cookies somebody told me said you know you ought to come to our youth group said we've got a big cooler on the wall full of soda pop and energy drinks anding anything you want you just come in and you just help yourself because we're we're four people wouldn't it be nice if that's all it was was a free soda pop and an energy drink and and a free pass to heaven but that's not the way it is churches now have coffee shops and dut hour I've preached in con taught in preached in conferences where people bring their donuts right on the front row in their cargo shorts and baseball caps with a donut on one knee and a cup of coffee in the other hand and they called that church I call that a picnic I didn't get in this thing to have a picnic there's a time for a picnic and there's a time to b battle we're in the last days and spiritually this is a Battle Ground we didn't come to eat cookies and so forth we're in a battle if you believe that say Amen but don't you forget we win because he has one couple more can I have a thank you thank you sir we would see Jesus he said brother footprints I got to put my footprints all around here Footprints I did that when God gave us this land I put my footprints all over it didn't know how we were going to move forward or that it would take uh all these years to come to the other side of it didn't know anything all I knew I told you this before I wrote a check uh what was her name Fay Bailey real estate woman Southern Southern lady F Bailey and she said Stephen can you write a check to hold the land I said oh I can do anything Miss fate yeah I can write a check but it ain't no good I said how much does it need to be forc she saidwell I don't know Steve she said probably $11,000 well that was a long time ago I certainly didn't have $1,000 laying around I said Miss Fay will you take this check knowing it's bad I said am I going to go to jail if I tell you right up front it is not any good but I I promise you that I'll make it good as soon as I possibly can within a few days I'll beg borrow or oh no I'll just beg oror borrow I won't steal and and because I believe this is the land God showed me and I want it for his glory and I've done walked all over she said you sure have she said I was about to leave you you sure have walked all over it she said you've probably walked all over every acre of it I'd say she said yes I'll take it I'll take it and I'll hold it and if I have to I'll put one of my own in there she said but if you believe this is the land that God wanted to give you all then I'm going to help you I'm going to stand with you I'm going to put my nose out there listen sometimes we can't wait until everything lines up sometimes we got to move against the 10 who say you can't and find somebody who will hang with you who as we can Footprints is possession now I like how he addresses the preachers here ministering Brethren he said don't be afraid to put Footprints to print Footprints where God has told you to go won't be easy you tell anybody comeing here in an easy jump it's not easy to get here it's not easy when you get here cuz sometimes when you're when you're visitor you know you're treated like a visitor and you get F more Fellowship you get this you get that the other we're not trying to fool nobody we usually speak up and say now we don't do like this all the time right I love to see company come anybody with me sometimes I love to see them go not because they get them I'm tired you just get tired maybe you don't you're so young and spry you spring chicken you but the rest of us we get a little weary sometime and so making that adjustment was not easy for anybody we mention Mimi ask her ask her she gathered up her little youngans loaded them up in the vehicle and came because for her it seemed to be life I know this sounds kind of clannish or death and Zachary was still in a baby carrier car seat type thing now he's got four that needed at the same time it seems like but but taliana is uh old enough that she can help take care of the rest she she it wasn't convenient it wasn't easy her name was mud and my name was mud for not forcing in her back you just want to you want to get real real but she made a choice under his inspiration that has set a path for Generations okay so now she can live and die if God Wills where she was supposed to be and so can her children that choose to and her children's children that choose to it matters it matters to obey it matters to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit oh I forgot I forgot there were visitors here when God tells you something is yours your place your tribe your home you'll find a way Footprints his possession God tells you Minister brother don't be afraid he told Joshua everywhere The Souls of your feet set I wish somebody would go right up there around that new house you see the for sale sign they built that house on what we were told is no man's land come to find out they lied to us or were greatly mistaken years ago so someone has built a beautiful fine home with its kitchen window looking right over into our Campground I wish some of you don't ask the price right now I wish some of you would just go up there and put your footprints on the yard they'll say I'm here to own this place praise God somebody said you're losing it now let me tell you something God can do anything according to his plan and will he can and here's what I don't want to do I don't want to get to heaven like they used to tell and find out that there's a pile of of gifts and goodies and blessings with my name on it that I never let my faith access I don't know if it happens that way or not but I've had others tell of experiences like that and it'll it'll it'll make you want to fight for what's yours even when you don't know what it is amen it's possession he told Josh everywhere the souls let's go on I got to I got to close now we don't back up hello you ought to like that you ought to nod a little louder you ought to wiggle your toe in your shoe a little wider there no matter we don't back up it's not a picnic for us we don't oh no matter what the opposition is how great it seems how difficult it seems if God said so when he gave it to Joshua he never said now here's what you're not going to like but you already know so you might as well like it he didn't say to Joshua I'll take all the hites and the Philistines and the you know jebusites and amorites and the All rights and is whatever he said I and give it to you no no Joshua Joshua Joshua in Hebrew yosua no J it sounds very much like the Hebrew name of our Lord came comes from the same root Yeshua yosua so Joshua's Ministry was a type of a coming one just like Moses his ministry Abraham typed something out Joshua had to fight for every inch of ground how could he do it but I'm almost done and every inch of ground you'll cover brother to make you will fight your way through but take the sword of the spirit brother and do what move right on tell somebody I'm going to take the sword of the spirit and I'm going to move right on come on humor me I I I quit faster when you humor me take the sword of the spirit brother and move right on because Footprints is its possession Hallelujah glory to God you ready for another I said it one or two more the Good Shepherd of the sheep God told Israel way down in Egypt I've given you that land it was called Palestine then it never was Palestine that was something the map map makers did he said now he could have just went up there and excomunion the whole thing run them all out with a plague killed them all off he could have went up there and sent fear among them he did it before and drove them out of the country but he said Israel you better hear this you're you're the spiritual part of this he said Israel it's yours you go get it they had to fight for every inch of ground they stood on if you believe that say amen and every promise in the book of The Great Shepherd is to his sheep but brother he'll never come down and drive it away from you you've got to fight oh yes you can oh yes you [Music] can it depends on what your prize is if your prize is the girl you may not get her only one can have her better be the one that God wants to have her my mama used to say the Sea's full of fish God's got listen God's got somebody don't let a girl be your prize some boy some knock need boy don't let him be the prize help us get your eyes on another prize I want to be in the center of God's will he'll give me the companion I need I find his will if I find his will first seek first the kingdom of God seek first the kingdom of God I'm not done yet seek first the kingdom of God and all these other things shall be added unto you that's right Austin right what he said drive it he but brother he'll never come down and drive it away from you you got to fight for every inch of that promise but it's yours it belongs to you let's see it's 130 130 130 130 we better go one more oh my you're precious you folks are so precious some of your neighbors are saying shut up shut sh quit saying one more you all don't talk to Annie like that the ement it's a short one I'll meet you in the middle God's word is eternal we just skipped one I think uh charity God's word is eternal if God's word is that perfect them who are in Christ just as sure to raise as there is a Resurrection God is just as obligated to his word to heal you as he is to save you that's good to know I like that for he it's his word that promised it it's God's word and we have no right to take away from it but just say it's the truth believe it no matter what happens believe it anyhow that's the way the rest of them had to believe it and we're not excluded from that God gave Palestine to Israel whatever whatever but they had to fight for every inch of ground they got the promise is yours but you have to fight for every inch you claim the devil will see to that certainly he will now here's what you need to know God said that land is yours but what he what he what he failed to say somebody else thinks it belongs to them you know I wonder no wonder some of them got discouraged and come back with the bad folk just being honest they said you know when God told us to take that land he didn't tell us somebody was already living in it with armies wall cities big population and that's kind of the way it is you need to know God's got a promise for you I'm going to go ahead and let you in on a secret the devil squatting on it yeah it don't belong to him it didn't belong to the parasites and the jebusites and the hivites and the Hittites and the amalekites and the aggravating nightes it it didn't belong to them they just squatted there that's right like some of these people will move in on a on a vacant home and if they stay there long enough you got to pay the taxes while they live in your house that's how messed up this life is sometime Come On You' think it'd just be easy you just go in bulldozer I'm out but that's not the way tie a rope around their feet and drag them out but they got squatters rights if you like that sort of thing you ought to move to California that's where they like it it seems but moving right along that was so political wasn't it forgive me forgive me but the devil's like that he moves in he squats and God said you go take that land and you walk over there thinking it's just an empty land with grapes growing on their own nobody has to you know kill the weeds and you know snakes like grapes CA they don't really like grapes they like birds and birds like to build their nest in the grape Vines and I don't I don't I don't I couldn't tell you how many times I went to my papa's grape vine and met a snake there ahead of me cuz he was there to get the little birds I wasn't going to let him keep me from the grapes I don't like snakes but I found out you you throw enough fuss and make enough noise and they'll go on I'm talking about alligators I said snakes and they just slither right off uh but the devil's not always so quick musicians are coming the devil's not always so quick to Slither out of your promise so even though God said it's yours you may find out that somebody's squatting there you can't let that discourage you you've got to push the end press press against while pressing in you can do it you can do it yes you can you can press the devil back you can press the D fraction back you can press the darkness back while you're pressing toward the the mark for the prize I'm here I'm here they can walk up there without you watching them they know the way they don't need a map y'all know the way everybody was worried about you you must have had a blank look on your faces as you was coming the enemy he's not just going go cause you think he should but you've got everything you need to push him out of the way the devil will tell you a thousand reasons why you can't all you need is to realize that you in God are a majority and you can have what you need you can have what he promised the scripture says God is not a man let's stand God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he would have need to repent the Oldtimer said God said it I believe it that settles it we realize that God said it that settles it and and whether you believe it or not depends on whether or not you'll be able to participate and partake but that don't mean somebody else won't believe it how many of you know he never fails Jesus never [Music] fails Jes Jesus never [Music] fails you might as well get thee behind me Satan you cannot Prevail

[Applause] [Music] him you see folks we're not following a a hawker's pitch a salesman's line this has been our reality yes yes you're right you know we're not here telling you what somebody told us God could do that's big I love to pass on testimonies but there's some folks in this room that have experienced this God and we've watched him move when there was no way to move there's people in this room that have seen God raise the dead not symbolically we've seen God raise the dead well I don't believe that well it don't matter but I tell you who does believe it the ones that was raised from the dead there's people in this room that have seen tumors on the outside of people's body fall off and gords swallowed and tumors in bellies disappear and women have to hold their clothes because the dress or the skirt was suddenly four or five sizes too big when God moved the tumor out of the belly we've seen God heal a girl with a broke back and she against all orders and instructions took off the back brace and ran all over the place healed by the power of God we saw what God did for Casey Hannah when he gave her victory over a fungus that was eating the plate that her brain sat on until little slivers of bone were coming out her nose and God healed her yes and she's alive today giving God praise we could go on and on and on so this is not what we just read in the Bible or what some preacher told us and we're too stupid and ignorant and unlearned so we just believe everything we're told but there are people in this room who've been in the fire and the fire couldn't burn them because God was bringing them through and there's people in this room that if face cancer diagnosis and on and on and on and on and on and go so what we're telling you is we've we've seen his track record and we know that he is what he says he is we don't understand why he don't always move the way we want him to move but we know he's moving and we can testify of it how many of you can say I've seen the power of God Amen in my own life I know what he can do now why don't you serve him why won't you give him everything you've got don't hold nothing back he deserves all of our praise and our dedication and our consecration may God pour oil on your faith as you leave here today may he anoint you I didn't get to that place in the notes but we'll get to it eventually where God told us you know in order to possess you've got to dispossess yes you got to drive some squatters off before you can take what's rightfully yours and the Lord spoke to us some years ago and he said I'm going to change the way you intercede in prayer and you're not going to always intercede from a place of warfare you're going to begin to intercede from a place of knowing that the answer is yours the victory is yours God has done what he said so you're just announcing to the enemy and declaring before your God that the work is done amen it's a work of Faith it's an Act of Faith and and and we know what one right word can do I want to pray for you right now before we leave because you have needs and God is a big God and he can answer you right where you stand I appreciate those of you that have come forward but God can move at the back door he can move wherever he can move on the other end of that camera God can move so if you've got a need before the Lord just put your hand up right now and it matters I want to tell you it matters Rebecca you're young but your need matters to the Lord just like sister gert's need and sister willam's need both of them pushing toward 90 and their need matters to the Lord but so does the little ones and he's able to meet those needs and if it's your need it's big don't matter how small if it's yours it feels big so I'm agreeing with you right now in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ father I am privileged and blessed to stand before such a faith fill people and we know that we know that we know that you have not changed that you are truly Hebrew Hebrews 13 and8 in our midst Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever and so we are not afraid intimidated or embarrassed to approach you again today and ask you to be who you have been in our lives Lord you said I Am The Great I Am I am everything you have need of and we're asking you Lord to minister to the faith and to the need of this your people wherever they are in the house or on the other end of that camera We join our faith with theirs right now and we say to the enemy of sickness you are a trespasser you are a squatter you need to go we say to worry and anxiety and fear and depression and nervousness and panic attacks you are an enemy and Jesus has given us victory over you you've got to go and we say to financial burdens and all the ways the enemy would try to oppress us in our finances Lord we have tried to be faithful to you and our giving and if we've done that you promised that you would rebuke the Devourer the very promise attached to giving you a tenth says I will rebuke rebuke the Devourer for your sake so Lord we ask you right now to rebuke the Devourer that has come to steal the seeds of our next Harvest Lord for those who need traveling grace and mercy we we ask for it right now knowing that you know how to line the highways the Airways with angels of protection and glory Lord those who were not a able to be here today because of sickness I ask you to reach to them now and touch their bodies and may they recover and may their faith bring them to the house on Tuesday night Lord I pray for the young people if you've got children around you or young ones around you or babies in your arms Stephen or you're standing back there near a little child put your hand on them I don't know why the Lord is emphasizing that as we leave today Lord you see these little ones you met me you came looking for me before I was 7even years old and Lord I believe you're looking for these and here they are now standing in your house in your presence to love on you and they're not ashamed of their praise they're not ashamed to lift their hands and hearts to worship you and they've got needs and I'm asking you Lord to minister to those needs strengthen their faith touch their bodies in a little while some of them will announce and show me and tell me their boo boos and they matter they matter and Lord I'm asking you right now to minister to those children to those young people those teenagers to those young married ones right now Lord Jesus may they have more of you and may they be consumed with more of a passion and may they run to you instead of from you Lord continue to heal Brother David man give him a glorious recovery restore proper hearing and and health to his body in the name of the Lord Jesus and every hand that
