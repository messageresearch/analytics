[44:31] throne of god
[44:33] hurry is especially weak today and he is
[44:36] heading to the pulpit to preach

[44:46] his post of duty
[44:47] sister audrey lewis needs to be

[45:06] but it really
[45:07] caught up with her in the night last

[46:05] more than we could ever think or imagine
[46:08] our father
[46:09] as we approach you today our hearts are
[46:12] grateful
[46:13] and thankful because you are moving in
[46:16] our lives and
[46:17] you are drawing us oh god and as we
[46:21] do sometimes face the fire and sometimes
[46:24] it seems like it's never going to let up
[46:27] but we realize
[46:28] god that this is working a beautiful
[46:30] work in the life of a believer
[46:33] it is more than we can even comprehend
[46:36] sometimes
[46:37] what this fire is doing in our lives and
[46:40] so we just say thank you lord
[46:42] that you have a perfect work for our
[46:45] lives
[46:46] and that you're bringing about uh not a
[46:50] a a
[46:50] new image that is just another person
[46:54] but
[46:54] you are bringing about the image of the
[46:56] lord jesus christ
[46:58] into the earth and lord that is what we
[47:01] long for
[47:02] we we're we're tired of of of ourselves
[47:05] being on display
[47:07] we want to see the living lord jesus on
[47:10] display in the earth
[47:12] so god we welcome you to work in our
[47:15] lives and do
[47:16] as you want to god when we draw back and
[47:20] we resist
[47:21] we ask you that you will tenderly by the
[47:23] voice of the holy spirit remind us
[47:26] that this is a work of the holy ghost
[47:28] that you're doing in
[47:29] us now god as we bring before you the
[47:33] needs of the people
[47:35] you saw the hands all over this building
[47:38] and you even see that
[47:39] the needs that are represented on the
[47:42] streaming those that are watching this
[47:44] service
[47:45] on different platforms today lord we're
[47:49] praying for each one of these needs you
[47:51] see
[47:52] desperation people who are desperate
[47:55] this morning
[47:56] for a move of god in their lives
[48:00] they feel dried up and withered up and
[48:02] they feel like that they can't go on
[48:05] but oh may the presence of the living
[48:08] god
[48:09] reach to them this day by the power
[48:13] that comes from on high oh lord
[48:16] let there be such a move
[48:20] of the spirit in our lives that all
[48:23] of that dryness would just disappear
[48:26] and we would feel the river of god
[48:29] flowing through our being this day
[48:32] you see sicknesses and ailments and
[48:35] diseases
[48:36] lord that they are many and then they're
[48:39] uh in the lives of the believers
[48:43] and god we're praying right now that you
[48:47] the healer would manifest your healing
[48:50] virtue
[48:51] in these situations god as our brother
[48:54] steve curry would go
[48:56] to the pulpit today to minister the word
[48:59] of god
[49:00] our fellow brother and minister we're
[49:03] asking god that you would let
[49:06] a special anointing come upon him
[49:10] that all of the weakness that he might
[49:12] have felt as he got there
[49:14] that it would just fall away lord and he
[49:16] would have such strength
[49:18] to deliver an on-time word to those
[49:20] people

[49:24] strengthen him and

[56:19] hour i want to give you a few minutes of
[56:22] a break and then we'll stand for the
[56:24] reading of the word
[56:25] and then you get to sit some more maybe
[56:29] it doesn't bother
[56:30] you but it bothers some people to stand
[56:32] that long and
[56:33] uh we want you to be able to focus
[56:37] here from the lord today because we
[56:39] believe he's here
[56:41] i don't know about you but i was so
[56:43] thankful
[56:45] when i walked out on the platform
[56:46] yesterday
[56:48] came up there's always the formality of
[56:50] the wedding and
[56:52] always in the back of your mind you're
[56:54] saying lord please don't let me forget
[56:56] please don't let me forget anything
[56:59] during the rehearsal we were trying to
[57:01] get
[57:02] the parents and grandparents in so that
[57:05] you know bring them in and
[57:07] let the ushers practice bringing them in
[57:09] and all of a sudden i looked up and i
[57:11] said well where's brother billy
[57:13] he's got to get in here and they said no
[57:16] no
[57:17] said he's bringing him the bride
[57:20] and so i embarrassed myself real good so
[57:23] when you when you come out to do a
[57:25] wedding or
[57:26] graduation or funeral or something like
[57:29] that that's not an ordinary service
[57:31] you're always having that in the back of
[57:33] your mind lord don't let me
[57:35] ruin their video don't let me ruin their
[57:38] memory
[57:38] let it be as special as possible and
[57:42] i chew my lozenger real quick before i
[57:45] come out so i don't spit it out while
[57:47] i'm talking and you just go through all
[57:48] these things
[57:50] you make sure that everything is zipped
[57:52] and buttoned and everything's
[57:54] in place the best it can be and
[57:58] brother greeley he knows and uh
[58:04] when i walked out here yesterday and we
[58:07] had an eclectic
[58:08] group of people here you can choose your
[58:11] friends but you don't choose your family
[58:15] they're just yours you just get them and
[58:17] they're not all going to be alike
[58:20] they're not all going to have normal
[58:22] hair
[58:23] they're going to be different they're
[58:26] it's just like a collection
[58:28] you just collect them and love them and
[58:30] accept them
[58:32] but i walked out here yesterday and by
[58:34] the time i got up on the platform
[58:36] i said of course david was facing this
[58:38] way and we're getting ready to
[58:40] the bridesmaids and whatever coming in i
[58:42] said i feel him
[58:44] he's here his presence already
[58:48] was so tangible for me that it just
[58:52] soothed everything
[58:54] it just soothed all that and i went once
[58:57] you know he's there why it wouldn't
[58:58] matter if you spit your
[59:00] lozenger out it wouldn't matter it
[59:02] wouldn't matter
[59:03] once his presence is there it wouldn't
[59:05] really matter at the end
[59:07] and he just got richer and richer as we
[59:10] went on
[59:12] and several people made the comment
[59:15] after it was over
[59:17] how the holy ghost came and said amen
[59:21] that was his amen over our service
[59:23] yesterday and the joining together
[59:26] of ashley and david and there were
[59:27] people here who had never been to
[59:29] anything like that
[59:31] and there the families that were
[59:32] represented have just recently had 10
[59:34] minute wedding services
[59:36] there was a couple here yesterday just
[59:38] married a couple weeks and their
[59:40] wedding i know it was special to them
[59:42] and i know that it's just as legal and
[59:44] holy before god but it was 12 12 or 13
[59:47] minutes and it's over
[59:49] and we don't uh we don't try that
[59:52] we want it to be everything that it can
[59:54] be
[59:55] you get one chance at it
[1:00:00] that's your chance and you want to make
[1:00:02] it holy
[1:00:03] and you want it to be presented in a way
[1:00:06] that it's not
[1:00:07] it's not loose it's not casual
[1:00:10] now after people see all the work and
[1:00:12] the effort that goes into it they said
[1:00:14] well
[1:00:14] i think i'll just elope and this is my
[1:00:17] answer to you
[1:00:18] christians don't elope
[1:00:21] that's my answer you don't have to say
[1:00:23] amen o me or nothing
[1:00:25] that's not the way of christ now you can
[1:00:28] do that
[1:00:28] and still be a child of god but that's
[1:00:31] not the christian way
[1:00:33] the christian way is to express those
[1:00:35] vows
[1:00:36] in the presence of god in the house of
[1:00:39] god with the saints of god
[1:00:41] not that god doesn't hear what you say
[1:00:43] privately or when you run away or do
[1:00:45] things like that
[1:00:46] but it should be a solemn moment and it
[1:00:49] should be celebrated as a solemn moment
[1:00:52] and yet there was such joy you're mighty
[1:00:55] quiet and i'm not nervous
[1:00:58] yet there was such joy in the room
[1:01:01] and there were those from other faiths
[1:01:03] there was a pastor's wife here
[1:01:06] there were those from other faith and
[1:01:08] even some who were serving like the
[1:01:10] photographers in different ones
[1:01:12] somebody said a couple people said
[1:01:15] that's the kind of wedding i want
[1:01:18] i want something that has some feeling
[1:01:20] to it
[1:01:21] and uh one young lady who had been
[1:01:25] very solemn i thought during the whole
[1:01:27] process
[1:01:28] and a little uncomfortable maybe not a
[1:01:31] part of the community but a
[1:01:32] very fine young lady but the presence of
[1:01:35] the lord came
[1:01:37] she didn't know what to call it she said
[1:01:39] i'm not an emotional person
[1:01:41] you probably could see that about me is
[1:01:43] what she said to me directly i'm not an
[1:01:45] emotional person
[1:01:46] she said i'm the one that holds it
[1:01:48] together for everybody else
[1:01:50] but she said i couldn't hold the tears
[1:01:52] back something happened to me
[1:01:54] that's what we want it's an opportunity
[1:01:58] to make an impact
[1:02:00] on somebody else's life so we want to
[1:02:03] continue to pray for david and ashley as
[1:02:05] they leave
[1:02:06] this area today and and head all the way
[1:02:09] to
[1:02:10] where they're going on their honeymoon
[1:02:12] several hours away and pray that god
[1:02:14] will just bless them and uh encourage
[1:02:18] their hearts
[1:02:19] and that they will really see the
[1:02:22] fulfillment
[1:02:23] of what the presence of god was doing
[1:02:25] yesterday making them
[1:02:27] one so that they can face their future
[1:02:31] we have another wedding coming up two
[1:02:33] weeks from yesterday
[1:02:35] we're already praying that god's
[1:02:37] presence will be real
[1:02:38] in that wedding as well and that it will
[1:02:41] just be beautiful
[1:02:42] everything yesterday was beautiful the
[1:02:45] food was
[1:02:46] delicious the the setting of the
[1:02:48] reception was perfection
[1:02:51] and all the hard work that went into it
[1:02:54] i know this couple appreciates it very
[1:02:56] much
[1:02:56] what their families did and what their
[1:02:58] church family did
[1:03:00] i know there was a lot of grace around
[1:03:02] the room
[1:03:03] i don't know if you were affected by
[1:03:05] what grandpa barr said but i was
[1:03:07] affected by that
[1:03:09] i was affected by that and i talked to
[1:03:12] him after the
[1:03:13] reception we were standing around we
[1:03:15] didn't think we could ever we honestly
[1:03:17] didn't think david and
[1:03:18] ashley would ever leave
[1:03:21] and finally we just said please leave
[1:03:24] you know get out of here and uh
[1:03:27] because we wanted to go home and they
[1:03:30] did finally leave
[1:03:32] uh we didn't get home till nine o'clock
[1:03:35] i think a little after nine so
[1:03:37] they had just left in fact they passed
[1:03:39] us
[1:03:40] they made a stop and passed us and
[1:03:42] honked their horn
[1:03:43] rolled the window down and waved as they
[1:03:44] were going out right out about
[1:03:46] the intersection of 379.
[1:03:49] but i was talking to grandpa bar about
[1:03:51] it and he said
[1:03:53] i've never told as far as i know i've
[1:03:56] never told another soul about that
[1:03:58] except teresa
[1:03:59] he said david heard it today for the
[1:04:01] first time
[1:04:03] he said i don't know if i could say that
[1:04:05] i've ever really heard from god
[1:04:06] ever since then like that but i know
[1:04:09] that is one time that prayer
[1:04:12] changed things and he was emotional
[1:04:15] and he said i almost didn't share it
[1:04:17] preacher
[1:04:18] he said i thought well no i haven't said
[1:04:21] it to them but to get up and tell the
[1:04:23] whole crowd
[1:04:23] i don't know if i can do it or not and
[1:04:25] he said this thought came to me
[1:04:27] i don't want to take that to my grave
[1:04:31] that's pretty serious business i
[1:04:33] appreciate it i said
[1:04:34] i i celebrate the fact
[1:04:38] that you did that and i said if jesus
[1:04:40] tarries david
[1:04:42] needs to be able to testify of that to
[1:04:45] his
[1:04:45] children and if it would have if it
[1:04:48] would have died with you
[1:04:50] he might not have had the opportunity to
[1:04:52] share it with his
[1:04:53] children and the minute i said that
[1:04:57] the inspiration from scripture came tell
[1:04:59] your children and
[1:05:01] their children's children tell them
[1:05:02] generation to generation
[1:05:04] what god did their lives would look a
[1:05:07] lot
[1:05:08] different david's life would look a lot
[1:05:10] different
[1:05:11] if in fact he would have been born with
[1:05:13] either one of those conditions
[1:05:15] somebody said we have no way of knowing
[1:05:17] whether that was true whether he really
[1:05:18] had that or whether that was just a
[1:05:20] premonition that wasn't i don't even
[1:05:23] care
[1:05:25] it doesn't even matter to me what
[1:05:27] matters to me is god was glorified in it
[1:05:31] grandpa's bar grandpa bars faith was
[1:05:33] strengthened in it and so was mine by
[1:05:36] sharing it and since i know that god can
[1:05:38] do that
[1:05:40] i have no problem believing that he did
[1:05:43] oh hallelujah somebody said what is that
[1:05:45] that's
[1:05:45] faith that's what faith looks like
[1:05:49] you know i don't know whether god's
[1:05:52] going to save us out of this fiery
[1:05:54] furnace or not
[1:05:56] we don't know what his plan is we may go
[1:05:59] down today but we're going to go down in
[1:06:01] his presence
[1:06:02] we're going to go down knowing the
[1:06:04] fourth man's with us
[1:06:05] and everything's gonna be all right
[1:06:07] that's what faith does
[1:06:09] faith answers the challenge doesn't it
[1:06:11] so let me just get this out of the way
[1:06:13] real quick

[1:12:30] if you're not is coming anyway
[1:12:33] it's on the way i'd like for you to
[1:12:37] turn first to genesis chapter
[1:12:41] 2 verse 7. we want to say thank you to
[1:12:44] the musicians
[1:12:46] appreciate what you've done
[1:12:48] [Music]
[1:12:49] i today your help yesterday as well
[1:12:55] genesis chapter 2 verse 7
[1:12:58] then i want to read
[1:13:03] luke chapter 1 verse 35
[1:13:09] genesis chapter 2 verse 7 said and the
[1:13:12] lord god
[1:13:13] formed man of the dust
[1:13:16] of the ground and breathed
[1:13:20] into his nostrils the breath
[1:13:24] of life the breath
[1:13:28] of life and man
[1:13:32] became a living soul
[1:13:37] adam received spirit life
[1:13:41] from the very breath of god
[1:13:45] which is the breath of life
[1:13:48] that body made from the earth
[1:13:53] adam from adamah
[1:13:57] that body made from the red dirt
[1:14:02] that's what it means god breathed into
[1:14:06] that
[1:14:06] when i see that in my mind i see it just
[1:14:09] like
[1:14:10] mouth-to-mouth resuscitation i
[1:14:14] see the very lips of god
[1:14:17] positioned over adam breathing
[1:14:20] exhaling his breath
[1:14:24] of life which is spirit
[1:14:28] the life of god is spirit
[1:14:31] not natural life but spirit life
[1:14:36] and in that moment adam became
[1:14:39] a tripartite man didn't he are you with
[1:14:43] me
[1:14:44] body spirit soul spirit
[1:14:48] soul body all three
[1:14:51] dynamics of man represented in that
[1:14:55] original
[1:14:56] creation adam i'm going to read it again
[1:14:59] in the lord god formed a man of the dust
[1:15:02] of the ground
[1:15:04] and breathed into his nostrils
[1:15:07] the breath of life and man
[1:15:11] became a living soul
[1:15:14] now let's read luke chapter one
[1:15:18] you might recognize this already
[1:15:24] verse 35
[1:15:30] and the angel said unto her
[1:15:34] let me just tell you this is gabriel
[1:15:36] speaking
[1:15:37] to mary or miriam the holy ghost
[1:15:42] shall come upon thee
[1:15:45] [Music]
[1:15:47] and the power of the highest
[1:15:51] shall overshadow thee
[1:15:55] therefore also that
[1:15:59] holy thing which shall be
[1:16:02] born of thee shall be called
[1:16:07] the son of god i want to read it
[1:16:10] just like that again and the angel
[1:16:13] answered and said unto her
[1:16:16] the holy ghost shall come upon thee
[1:16:20] and the power of the highest shall
[1:16:23] overshadow thee therefore
[1:16:26] also that holy thing
[1:16:30] which shall be born of thee shall be
[1:16:33] called
[1:16:34] the son of god father we need your help
[1:16:39] today
[1:16:40] our bodies are tired we had a big
[1:16:44] day of celebration yesterday and a lot
[1:16:47] of
[1:16:48] preparation leading up to that
[1:16:51] it's left a lot of people's bodies a
[1:16:54] little worn
[1:16:55] but we need your presence
[1:16:59] we need this service today we need your
[1:17:03] word
[1:17:03] because it's more important to our
[1:17:06] existence
[1:17:08] than the lunch that we will have this
[1:17:10] afternoon
[1:17:12] we need the living word of god it gives
[1:17:16] us strength it sustains
[1:17:19] us in a world of spiritual
[1:17:22] famine this famine of hearing
[1:17:26] the word of god it must take preeminence
[1:17:30] in the life of the believer
[1:17:32] and it's not punishment
[1:17:36] but rather it's life to us
[1:17:40] so may we feed upon that word would you
[1:17:42] anoint your servant
[1:17:44] to declare it would you anoint your
[1:17:47] servant's
[1:17:48] ears to hear it and would you receive
[1:17:51] the glory
[1:17:52] when the last amen is said we ask
[1:17:56] this in the name of the lord jesus
[1:17:57] christ for his glory
[1:18:00] and the saints said you may be seated
[1:18:03] again
[1:18:06] we started reading of adam
[1:18:09] that freshly fashioned
[1:18:12] formed man of dust
[1:18:16] man of the red earth and he was
[1:18:20] only a body just a form
[1:18:23] no life in him whatsoever although he
[1:18:27] had been
[1:18:28] created by the very fingertips of god
[1:18:32] he was still an empty shell
[1:18:36] until he was filled with the breath of
[1:18:39] life and the breath of god
[1:18:43] the breath of god's life is spirit
[1:18:48] brother branham told us many times
[1:18:51] the contrast of dynamics
[1:18:55] and mechanics he said you can have
[1:18:58] all the mechanics you can have it all
[1:19:02] chrome plated
[1:19:04] shined up you can have the most clean
[1:19:07] beautiful engine that's ever been built
[1:19:11] by
[1:19:11] man but without the dynamic it can have
[1:19:14] chrome plated steering wheel and wheels
[1:19:18] on the tires and
[1:19:19] oh my he would go on some time to
[1:19:22] describe a real hot rod you might say
[1:19:25] but it's no more than just an old hunk
[1:19:28] of
[1:19:29] metal unless there's a spark in there
[1:19:32] to cause that car to do what it was
[1:19:35] designed that engine to do what it was
[1:19:37] designed to do and that's
[1:19:38] run there is the there is this
[1:19:42] expectation
[1:19:44] that there will be a combustion that
[1:19:47] takes place
[1:19:48] a spark that ignites a starter that
[1:19:52] starts a carburetor that carburetes uh
[1:19:55] on and on and on you can tell already
[1:19:57] i'm not a mechanic
[1:19:59] but the goal is to propel the vehicle
[1:20:02] forward to create something that you can
[1:20:06] get in and
[1:20:07] it's a little higher up than the buggy
[1:20:09] in the wagon day you know
[1:20:11] horse and buggy horse and wagon day
[1:20:13] little higher
[1:20:14] advance in transportation and
[1:20:18] it takes that holy ghost spark
[1:20:21] it takes the holy ghost dynamics
[1:20:24] to fall on the mechanics to cause the
[1:20:28] believer
[1:20:29] to be fit for service you and i are
[1:20:32] just a hunk of junk until
[1:20:35] he breathes his breath of life in
[1:20:38] us by the power of the holy ghost
[1:20:41] we can have a good pedigree we can be
[1:20:43] raised in the finest home and we
[1:20:46] can have all the the comforts of home
[1:20:48] and
[1:20:49] a good mother and a good father and lots
[1:20:51] of love and
[1:20:52] and uh whatever else but we're just
[1:20:56] normal ordinary people just empty
[1:21:00] vessels
[1:21:01] until the holy ghost comes and breathes
[1:21:05] breathes the breath of life into us
[1:21:08] if you understand the simplicity of what
[1:21:10] i'm saying would you just say amen
[1:21:13] then we skipped over to luke and we read
[1:21:16] about the angel's visitation
[1:21:19] to mary this young virgin
[1:21:23] jewish believing girl perhaps
[1:21:26] as the prophet told us she was one of
[1:21:29] those
[1:21:30] who had heard of the prophecy of isaiah
[1:21:33] that a virgin shall conceive and bring
[1:21:36] forth a child
[1:21:37] brother branham said for generations
[1:21:39] after isaiah's prophecy
[1:21:41] young little girls would knit booties
[1:21:45] and prepare their home hear me what i'm
[1:21:48] saying now
[1:21:49] prepare their home and their life in
[1:21:52] case
[1:21:54] just in case they might would be the one
[1:21:58] that would carry the messiah in their
[1:22:01] womb
[1:22:02] you know what that is that's what we
[1:22:04] were talking about just a few minutes
[1:22:06] ago
[1:22:06] it's called faith it's called faith
[1:22:10] that identifies yourself with the word
[1:22:14] of promise
[1:22:15] you've not just got to have faith you've
[1:22:17] got to be able to take a promise a
[1:22:19] particular promise
[1:22:20] and put your faith in that promise and
[1:22:23] say that's not
[1:22:24] just for all mankind but that is for me
[1:22:28] as an individual that is my promise
[1:22:32] and if god can do it for anybody he can
[1:22:34] do it for me
[1:22:37] why would he because he loves you
[1:22:41] and has loved you from before the
[1:22:43] foundation of the world
[1:22:45] you're his and he's not going to lose
[1:22:48] you
[1:22:50] and as we talked about here tuesday
[1:22:52] night
[1:22:53] he has separated you from your sin
[1:22:56] as far as the east is from the west
[1:22:59] you'll never ever encounter your sin
[1:23:02] again
[1:23:03] not that sin that sin has been dealt
[1:23:06] with
[1:23:07] by the precious blood of jesus christ
[1:23:10] how many of you know it's right
[1:23:12] and this example that we talked about
[1:23:14] you can
[1:23:15] start traveling north and go all the way
[1:23:18] to the north pole
[1:23:20] and when you pass the north pole you're
[1:23:23] no longer traveling north
[1:23:25] you're traveling south because we know
[1:23:27] exactly where north begins
[1:23:30] we know exactly where south begins so it
[1:23:33] doesn't matter what it looks like
[1:23:34] on on a globe what matters is the fact
[1:23:38] is you've now
[1:23:39] passed the pole of north so now you're
[1:23:41] moving south
[1:23:42] but there is no distinguishing point
[1:23:46] where east begins or where west begins
[1:23:49] and so the rider was wise to choose the
[1:23:53] analogy
[1:23:54] to be so far separated from our sin
[1:23:57] as far as the east is from the west
[1:24:00] because that means you could chase
[1:24:02] it some people go chasing after it to
[1:24:04] see if it's still there
[1:24:06] i want you to know it's not there if
[1:24:08] you've repented of your sin
[1:24:10] if the blood of jesus christ has been
[1:24:13] applied
[1:24:14] it's not just covered up it's absolutely
[1:24:17] as
[1:24:17] though it never happened in the first
[1:24:20] place
[1:24:22] it's greater than just a remi just a
[1:24:25] covering
[1:24:25] it's a remission remission it's a
[1:24:28] remitting
[1:24:29] of sin god is so good
[1:24:32] today i want to begin a little uh series
[1:24:36] on the seven offices of the holy ghost
[1:24:41] now let me tell you that i don't know
[1:24:45] that offices is the perfect
[1:24:48] word maybe when we're finished
[1:24:52] with this little study the next few
[1:24:54] services
[1:24:56] you will have come up with a better word
[1:24:58] and i'll use it
[1:25:00] because i don't say that office is the
[1:25:03] greatest word maybe administration
[1:25:06] seven administrations
[1:25:09] maybe even the word executions
[1:25:13] i considered all three but at the end of
[1:25:17] this it's not
[1:25:19] to have the perfect word to describe
[1:25:23] these ministries of the holy spirit
[1:25:26] in our life but it is to be able to
[1:25:29] recognize them
[1:25:31] and cooperate with them when they work
[1:25:34] in
[1:25:34] us now let me from the outset let me say
[1:25:38] i'm not talking about isaiah 11.
[1:25:42] i'm not talking about what isaiah calls
[1:25:44] the seven spirits of god
[1:25:47] i'm not talking about the seven eyes of
[1:25:49] the lamb
[1:25:50] i'm not talking about the seven stars or
[1:25:53] the
[1:25:54] seven burning lamps before the throne
[1:25:57] i'm not talking about the seven-fold
[1:26:00] spirit of god that we read about
[1:26:04] in isaiah i'm talking about
[1:26:07] seven ministries or seven offices
[1:26:11] seven administrations seven
[1:26:15] executions that are given to us
[1:26:18] in the scripture of how the holy ghost
[1:26:22] works in our lives are you awake
[1:26:27] i don't know exactly how to explain
[1:26:31] it in a way that i could introduce it
[1:26:34] and you would just
[1:26:35] jump on board and follow me all the way
[1:26:38] through this but i can tell you that
[1:26:40] god's been talking to me about this a
[1:26:42] long time now
[1:26:44] and if i had to choose an analogy
[1:26:48] that might help you to understand where
[1:26:51] we're going to go
[1:26:52] in the next few services i'm only going
[1:26:54] to speak of one of those offices today
[1:26:58] i would say it's something like
[1:27:01] the comprehensive authority structure
[1:27:06] of the presidency of the united states
[1:27:09] of america
[1:27:11] i know this is a uh a subject that we
[1:27:15] don't even want to think about right now
[1:27:17] but we have to
[1:27:19] we have to think about it because it's
[1:27:22] an office
[1:27:24] that is supposed to speak to us of
[1:27:27] strength
[1:27:31] go ahead say amen strength
[1:27:35] power authority
[1:27:39] the highest office in the land
[1:27:43] in order for someone to be able to carry
[1:27:45] out that
[1:27:47] office they need to be sound
[1:27:50] sound mind sound body
[1:27:54] oh my
[1:27:58] not ignoring reality
[1:28:02] not ignoring what's going on at the
[1:28:04] border
[1:28:07] not turning a blind eye it's not
[1:28:12] i want to just say this i just gotta say
[1:28:14] this strike it from the record if
[1:28:17] you must i want you to know that
[1:28:20] southern border of the united states
[1:28:22] should never ever
[1:28:24] be considered the new ellis island
[1:28:30] who's ever heard of such an analogy as
[1:28:32] that
[1:28:34] i think a preschooler could understand
[1:28:37] the difference
[1:28:39] between coming to this country legally
[1:28:41] like all of our parents did
[1:28:44] gran i don't know how far back but
[1:28:47] somewhere in your family line unless
[1:28:49] you're 100
[1:28:51] native american your your family were
[1:28:54] immigrants to this country can you say
[1:28:56] man
[1:28:57] they came legally if they got here and
[1:28:59] stayed most likely
[1:29:01] and ellis island was there to make sure
[1:29:04] that people came in the legal way the
[1:29:06] right way so to compare what's going on
[1:29:09] on our southern border
[1:29:10] with ellis island it's it's sic it's
[1:29:13] really sick
[1:29:14] it's sad it speaks of the condition
[1:29:17] of our nation enough of that but no
[1:29:20] apology made
[1:29:22] the president of the united states is
[1:29:25] he has a huge job
[1:29:29] it's huge wouldn't matter if it was a
[1:29:32] man or a woman it's a huge
[1:29:34] job to do he's the he's the chief
[1:29:38] executive of the nation amen
[1:29:43] he's the chief administrator of the
[1:29:46] nation
[1:29:49] he is the chief diplomat
[1:29:52] some people would call him the face
[1:29:55] of the nation is that right
[1:29:58] we don't have a prime minister the
[1:30:01] president is the highest
[1:30:02] representation of our nation that exists
[1:30:06] he is the one ultimately responsible
[1:30:10] for the welfare of this nation
[1:30:15] should our country go to war he
[1:30:18] serves as commander-in-chief
[1:30:21] of the nation's armed forces
[1:30:25] i want you to know that job right there
[1:30:27] is big enough to overwhelm anybody
[1:30:30] he's commander-in-chief of the army and
[1:30:33] the navy
[1:30:34] and the air force and the marines there
[1:30:37] are many
[1:30:37] underneath him who administer that
[1:30:41] authority
[1:30:42] on a ground level but he is
[1:30:45] the ultimate authority he's the one who
[1:30:49] carries the suitcase
[1:30:51] with the nuclear code he's the one who
[1:30:54] has the authority to do that don't don't
[1:30:57] don't think on that long
[1:31:00] don't think on that long and i'm so
[1:31:02] thankful to know there are a few checks
[1:31:03] and balances in place
[1:31:06] to make sure that someone unstable
[1:31:08] doesn't just blow up another nation
[1:31:11] and cause us to be blowed up in response
[1:31:14] anybody listening i'm telling you it's a
[1:31:17] big
[1:31:18] but only one man can be the president of
[1:31:20] the united states at the same time
[1:31:22] or one woman at one time
[1:31:26] but they are responsible to where every
[1:31:29] one of those
[1:31:30] hats at any given time come on now
[1:31:34] a vice president serves at the pleasure
[1:31:36] of the president
[1:31:38] they can be assigned to specific
[1:31:41] tasks and it can be as simple as laying
[1:31:45] a wreath
[1:31:45] on a grave it can be as serious as being
[1:31:48] made a czar
[1:31:50] of a certain administration of the
[1:31:53] government like our vice president
[1:31:55] has been put in charge of the situation
[1:31:58] at the southern border but
[1:31:59] ultimately the responsibility does not
[1:32:02] fall on her head
[1:32:04] it falls on the president's head he's
[1:32:07] one man
[1:32:09] and every one of those jobs
[1:32:12] would you call them offices would you
[1:32:15] call them
[1:32:16] executions of his office would you call
[1:32:19] them administrations
[1:32:21] of his responsibility i don't know what
[1:32:23] you would call them
[1:32:24] but i want you to understand as you look
[1:32:26] this way
[1:32:28] i want you to understand that i'm
[1:32:30] talking about one man
[1:32:32] one person with many
[1:32:35] important jobs to execute
[1:32:39] and so when i say the seven offices of
[1:32:42] the holy spirit
[1:32:43] i want you to hear it in the way that
[1:32:45] i'm presenting it i'm not saying i have
[1:32:47] the definitive list
[1:32:50] and i'm not saying that office is the
[1:32:52] best word to use
[1:32:54] but i'm saying that the holy ghost is
[1:32:56] more than a chill
[1:32:59] he's more than a thrill he's
[1:33:02] more than an unknown tongue he's more
[1:33:05] than a
[1:33:06] feeling he has a lot of responsibilities
[1:33:11] and he desires to execute all of those
[1:33:14] responsibilities in our life
[1:33:16] to the glory of god are you with me on
[1:33:19] that
[1:33:20] so when the holy ghost came and the
[1:33:23] angel
[1:33:24] spoke to mary and said to her the holy
[1:33:27] ghost shall come upon thee
[1:33:29] that's all that he is all that the holy
[1:33:32] ghost
[1:33:32] is shall come upon thee
[1:33:36] and the power of the highest or the most
[1:33:39] high
[1:33:40] shall overshadow thee therefore
[1:33:44] also that holy thing which shall be
[1:33:48] born of thee shall be
[1:33:51] called the son of god
[1:33:54] now this message came by an angel
[1:33:58] who was dispatched by the father
[1:34:01] is that correct it's the father's
[1:34:04] responsibility
[1:34:06] to dispatch angels on certain missions
[1:34:10] with certain responsibilities to carry
[1:34:12] out are you with me
[1:34:14] i'm going to keep checking on you now
[1:34:16] because i don't want you to miss where
[1:34:17] we're going
[1:34:19] it's the father's responsibility to do
[1:34:21] that so that
[1:34:22] so we could say that it was the father
[1:34:25] who
[1:34:25] sent gabriel the angel of the lord
[1:34:30] to speak to mary and to talk to her
[1:34:32] about what was about to take place
[1:34:35] and he said the holy ghost is going to
[1:34:37] come on you the power of the highest
[1:34:39] is going to overshadow thee this is a
[1:34:42] consummation taking place
[1:34:45] there is a seed that is being placed
[1:34:49] in the womb of a virgin mary
[1:34:52] that is not deposited there by a man
[1:34:57] it's being deposited there by the holy
[1:35:00] ghost
[1:35:01] under the dispatch of the father
[1:35:05] the father is sending the holy ghost
[1:35:09] to overshadow mary to plant a seed
[1:35:14] now the prophet taught us and i believe
[1:35:16] it is true
[1:35:18] that not only did god provide the
[1:35:22] the seed he also provided the egg or the
[1:35:27] ovum
[1:35:28] he placed that in her womb so that
[1:35:32] it there would be no room
[1:35:35] for the natural aspect of the flesh
[1:35:40] this is a holy thing and
[1:35:43] because the mother is the one
[1:35:46] uh you know we we understand about the
[1:35:49] blood and how the blood
[1:35:51] comes and there is some dispute about
[1:35:54] how that happens
[1:35:55] but let me say that god was covering
[1:35:59] all the bases there was no room for
[1:36:02] error in the body of the lord jesus he
[1:36:06] created the womb he created the egg
[1:36:09] he created the seed the sperma
[1:36:13] that would fertilize would
[1:36:16] consummate by the spirit not by a
[1:36:19] natural act of intimacy
[1:36:22] and the life the holy thing
[1:36:25] that was formed as a result of that
[1:36:29] overshadowing
[1:36:30] and the holy ghost coming upon mary that
[1:36:33] holy thing
[1:36:34] would forever be called the son
[1:36:37] of god now we don't have time
[1:36:40] to reestablish the fact that god is not
[1:36:43] a trinity
[1:36:44] but he never has been and he never will
[1:36:48] be
[1:36:49] and there's no scripture that says
[1:36:51] anything like a trinity
[1:36:53] it is absolutely a creation of the
[1:36:56] catholic church
[1:36:58] and it has been used to cause
[1:37:01] people to misunderstand who god is down
[1:37:04] through the ages
[1:37:06] and those who opposed the lie of rome
[1:37:09] were killed if they got too vocal
[1:37:13] they were just killed i don't know what
[1:37:15] to think about a church that just kills
[1:37:17] off their enemies
[1:37:18] but the catholic church considered every
[1:37:21] enemy of the church an enemy of god
[1:37:24] and they had no problem physically
[1:37:25] taking their lives
[1:37:27] and that's why the blood of tens of
[1:37:29] thousands of martyrs are crying out in
[1:37:31] the book of revelation
[1:37:32] crying out because they were not
[1:37:35] murdered by murderers
[1:37:37] and by those who had no uh knowledge of
[1:37:40] faith
[1:37:41] but murdered by their own church serious
[1:37:43] business isn't it
[1:37:45] so because we understand a little bit
[1:37:47] about how the godhead functions
[1:37:49] we understand that if mary was
[1:37:53] overshadowed by the holy ghost the power
[1:37:56] of the highest overshadowed her
[1:37:58] and provided the seed that germinated
[1:38:02] the egg and caused
[1:38:03] life to come forth then if we believed
[1:38:06] it in a trinitarian fashion
[1:38:08] we would have to say jesus was born with
[1:38:10] two fathers
[1:38:11] the father because remember the essence
[1:38:14] of the trinitarian doctrine
[1:38:16] is that god is three persons
[1:38:20] and if you've got two persons
[1:38:24] as a father of the same son
[1:38:30] something's a little odd
[1:38:34] even though the world tries to cram that
[1:38:36] down our throats
[1:38:38] it's just not the way it works so we
[1:38:41] know that
[1:38:42] that this father is an
[1:38:45] office of god and the holy ghost is an
[1:38:48] office of god
[1:38:50] an administration of god whatever
[1:38:53] however
[1:38:54] you find comfort in describing it but
[1:38:58] of the same essence of the same spirit
[1:39:01] one spirit
[1:39:03] one holy spirit overshadowed mary
[1:39:06] and that which was born in her womb was
[1:39:09] of the spirit
[1:39:11] yet it had a physical body as john 1
[1:39:14] 1 and john 1 14 tell us
[1:39:17] in the beginning was the word and the
[1:39:19] word was with god and the word was god
[1:39:22] and the word became flesh powerful truth
[1:39:26] the foundation of our faith it's what we
[1:39:29] stand on today
[1:39:31] but in the holy ghost there are
[1:39:34] also administrations and offices
[1:39:38] ministries executions however you would
[1:39:41] want to describe it
[1:39:43] those are mentioned in the bible and
[1:39:45] we're going to begin a little bit of a
[1:39:46] study on that because i believe the lord
[1:39:49] will speak to you before it's over and
[1:39:52] help you to understand
[1:39:54] that you have more help than you realize
[1:39:58] to make this thing i'm telling you he
[1:40:01] lives in
[1:40:02] you by the power of the holy ghost and
[1:40:06] he has so many purposes so many
[1:40:08] offices so many executions so many
[1:40:11] administrations
[1:40:12] he has so much purpose in your life to
[1:40:14] do so many things for you
[1:40:16] that all you and i have to do is yield
[1:40:19] ourselves
[1:40:20] to the person to the life of jesus
[1:40:23] christ that's in
[1:40:24] us and allow him to live his life
[1:40:27] out his
[1:40:31] life is to be an overflow
[1:40:36] it's to come and fill and then flow
[1:40:39] over flow out of our lives
[1:40:43] to minister to others we pray
[1:40:46] so in the same way the president is one
[1:40:49] man with all kinds of different offices
[1:40:52] chief administrator chief executive
[1:40:54] chief diplomat
[1:40:56] commander-in-chief he goes on and on and
[1:40:58] on and on
[1:41:00] just one man with all these different
[1:41:02] responsibilities the holy ghost
[1:41:04] is just one spirit the father
[1:41:07] and the holy ghost are the same spirit
[1:41:10] the spirit that lives in the body of
[1:41:12] jesus christ
[1:41:13] is the same spirit as the father he is
[1:41:16] the same spirit as the holy ghost
[1:41:19] these are different offices of god and
[1:41:22] we know
[1:41:23] that they work together because they are
[1:41:26] one
[1:41:27] and yet they are different in the sense
[1:41:29] that they have different
[1:41:30] responsibilities
[1:41:32] they have different ministries they
[1:41:34] operate in different ways
[1:41:37] all to the glory of the same god
[1:41:40] if you're with me say man if you're
[1:41:42] asleep say amen
[1:41:47] i believe if we should take these
[1:41:49] offices seven of them
[1:41:52] and start going through the different
[1:41:54] references of what the holy spirit does
[1:41:56] in our life
[1:41:57] we would find at least 66 and i think i
[1:42:00] may could find uh 70.
[1:42:04] at least 66 maybe even
[1:42:07] 70 different services that the holy
[1:42:11] ghost
[1:42:12] carries out in our life whoa
[1:42:16] he's busy he's busy
[1:42:19] because he operates in you in at least
[1:42:22] seven offices
[1:42:24] and at least 66 specific
[1:42:27] services mentioned in the scripture
[1:42:30] there is more
[1:42:31] sad about the spirit of god and the holy
[1:42:34] ghost
[1:42:35] of god than about the father and the son
[1:42:39] put together interesting isn't it
[1:42:43] because getting god in you
[1:42:47] god giving in you was his purpose
[1:42:51] from the beginning he didn't just want
[1:42:54] to live above you
[1:42:56] he didn't just want to walk through life
[1:42:58] by your side
[1:43:00] he wanted to crawl inside of you
[1:43:03] by the power of his spirit
[1:43:07] and give you what you need to make it
[1:43:12] be over let me tell you how you're going
[1:43:14] to overcome
[1:43:15] you're going to overcome because the
[1:43:18] overcomer
[1:43:19] lives inside of you
[1:43:23] and as you learn him and learn to lean
[1:43:27] on him and learn to cooperate with him
[1:43:31] you'll find out this is not to make you
[1:43:33] lazy
[1:43:34] but you'll find out you're striving in
[1:43:37] the flesh
[1:43:38] way too hard there is a more effective
[1:43:42] way to strive
[1:43:44] all striving is not sin according to the
[1:43:47] bible
[1:43:48] there are there's a right way to strive
[1:43:51] and there's a wrong way to strive
[1:43:53] it's never right to strive in the flesh
[1:43:56] it's never right to strive in the mind
[1:43:59] in the will or in the emotions which
[1:44:02] make up the realm of the soul
[1:44:04] all real striving comes from an
[1:44:08] inspiration
[1:44:09] in the spirit a re-generated
[1:44:14] spirit that lives inside of you
[1:44:17] the holy spirit joining with your spirit
[1:44:22] to regenerate it to make it alive
[1:44:26] you have had a rebirth you have had a
[1:44:30] resurrection in your fallen human spirit
[1:44:34] and now that human spirit has been
[1:44:37] overshadowed
[1:44:38] it has been swallowed up in the gift
[1:44:42] of his holy spirit that now lives inside
[1:44:45] of you
[1:44:46] remember he wasn't satisfied to be over
[1:44:48] your head
[1:44:50] he wasn't satisfied to be at your elbow
[1:44:53] he
[1:44:53] wanted to live inside of you
[1:44:57] to the glory of god if you believe that
[1:44:59] same man
[1:45:00] i'm working a little hard and i'm going
[1:45:02] to do it i'm going to do it i'm going to
[1:45:03] keep on
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:08] now of these seven
[1:45:12] divine offices i'm going to keep saying
[1:45:16] administrations executions
[1:45:19] whatever word you need maybe by the end
[1:45:21] of it we'll be so
[1:45:23] uh settled on the word we just say it
[1:45:27] of these seven divine offices of the
[1:45:29] holy spirit that we can
[1:45:31] find in the new testament the first four
[1:45:35] of them and you'll recognize them you'll
[1:45:37] recognize them
[1:45:38] you who are just looking at me like i
[1:45:39] don't know where and where you're going
[1:45:41] you'll recognize them in a minute
[1:45:42] if you're a student of the bible at all
[1:45:44] you'll recognize them in a moment
[1:45:47] the first four of those seven offices
[1:45:50] reveal
[1:45:50] the work of the holy spirit in creating
[1:45:55] the divine life of christ
[1:45:58] in the believer i want to say that again
[1:46:02] those first four divine offices
[1:46:05] of the holy spirit they administrate
[1:46:08] their job their their work their
[1:46:11] ministry in you
[1:46:12] is in creating the divine life
[1:46:15] of god in us did you know the divine
[1:46:19] life of god is in you
[1:46:20] let me ask you that did you know that's
[1:46:22] what the baptism of the holy ghost is
[1:46:24] did you know it's like what happened to
[1:46:26] adam
[1:46:28] god breathing in your nostrils
[1:46:31] the breath of spirit the breath of
[1:46:34] life did you know we could also say the
[1:46:37] breath of light
[1:46:40] because light life and spirit in the
[1:46:42] bible
[1:46:43] has the same ministry it accomplishes
[1:46:47] the same thing
[1:46:47] are you with me i don't mean to keep
[1:46:50] saying that but if i felt like you were
[1:46:51] i wouldn't ask
[1:46:53] first john chapter 5 we're almost off of
[1:46:56] page 1.
[1:46:58] first john chapter 5 verse 11 and 12.
[1:47:05] and this is the record that
[1:47:08] god hath given to us
[1:47:12] eternal life
[1:47:16] and this life is
[1:47:19] in his son
[1:47:22] listen again and this is the record that
[1:47:26] god hath given to us
[1:47:27] eternal life and this life is in
[1:47:31] his son he that hath the son
[1:47:34] hath life i thought the spirit
[1:47:39] is what brings us life it is
[1:47:43] don't you understand that the sun was
[1:47:46] filled
[1:47:48] with the spirit don't you remember
[1:47:52] we've said it thousands of times brother
[1:47:55] branham maybe hundreds of times
[1:47:57] all that the father was he poured and
[1:48:01] emptied into the sun and all that the
[1:48:03] sun was
[1:48:04] he emptied into the church oh brother
[1:48:08] don't let that be old news to you
[1:48:12] that's the best news i have to
[1:48:15] share with you you don't have to lose
[1:48:18] you don't have to go down in defeat
[1:48:22] you don't have to slide back
[1:48:26] you don't have to live in depression
[1:48:29] or grief you do not have to
[1:48:32] live there because greater
[1:48:36] is he that lives on the inside
[1:48:39] of you which is the life of the son
[1:48:43] what lives in you by the holy ghost the
[1:48:46] life of the son
[1:48:47] the life of the father same life
[1:48:52] same spirit what's it called in greek
[1:48:55] zoe it's the same life
[1:48:59] it's the same spirit and i want you to
[1:49:02] know
[1:49:03] there's no defeat in christ
[1:49:08] there's no molly grubs in him we fight
[1:49:10] them
[1:49:11] we fight them because we live with a
[1:49:13] divided mind
[1:49:15] but if we can live with a single vision
[1:49:19] if we can live with a single eye if we
[1:49:22] can live with a single mind
[1:49:24] we'll walk in the victory that lives
[1:49:27] inside of
[1:49:28] us now when you preach like that you've
[1:49:31] got all these people making
[1:49:34] all of their pleas making sure that
[1:49:37] everybody understands
[1:49:39] the circumstances of their life
[1:49:42] and how difficult they are so you don't
[1:49:45] need me preaching that
[1:49:48] you're gonna do that on social media
[1:49:55] you're going to do that when you talk to
[1:49:56] one another after church
[1:49:59] you're going to do that over coffee oh
[1:50:02] i'm really going through something these
[1:50:05] days
[1:50:06] you don't need me to preach that to you
[1:50:09] it's your reality
[1:50:10] you live it and whether you admit it or
[1:50:13] not you want to share it
[1:50:15] there's no doubt in my mind none
[1:50:18] whatsoever
[1:50:19] because i've been fighting this same
[1:50:22] battle that you fight
[1:50:24] ever since i received the baptism of the
[1:50:26] holy ghost
[1:50:27] the enemy wanted to destroy me
[1:50:30] with depression just like he wants to
[1:50:33] destroy
[1:50:34] you we're not always up
[1:50:38] but we're never defeated
[1:50:42] come on now we're not always dancing in
[1:50:45] the victory
[1:50:47] but we always have the life of the sun
[1:50:51] and that's what you need to hear that's
[1:50:54] what you need to be reminded of
[1:50:56] you don't really need me to pet you
[1:51:00] in your place you need me to remind you
[1:51:04] that god has paid an ultimate
[1:51:08] price and if we choose
[1:51:12] to live in that how is it better
[1:51:16] to be a believer
[1:51:22] if a nerve peel can fix it we don't need
[1:51:25] the holy ghost
[1:51:27] come on if if if counseling can help it
[1:51:31] we don't really need listen everybody
[1:51:35] fights
[1:51:39] everybody has a battle you don't need to
[1:51:42] be reminded of mine
[1:51:43] and i don't need to be always reminded
[1:51:45] of yours but what we do need to do
[1:51:48] is speak to one another in faith
[1:51:51] and speak to one another by the spirit
[1:51:54] and speak to one another by the word of
[1:51:56] god
[1:51:57] and remind each other that we are we are
[1:52:00] i don't mean to say it quite like this
[1:52:02] but we are better
[1:52:06] we are living a higher life
[1:52:09] we're not even of that old race
[1:52:14] why do you want to spend so much time
[1:52:17] associating yourself with adam's fallen
[1:52:20] race
[1:52:21] when you are born of the spirit and now
[1:52:24] you are a part of the royal seed
[1:52:27] of abraham tell the devil he's a liar
[1:52:31] tell the devil he's defeated in your
[1:52:34] life
[1:52:35] tell the devil he's lost the battle for
[1:52:37] you
[1:52:39] the overcomer lives in you
[1:52:42] the holy ghost is in you with all of his
[1:52:45] offices
[1:52:46] with all of his administrations with all
[1:52:49] of his executions
[1:52:50] he is there to overcome for you
[1:52:54] in you so that you can have victory
[1:52:58] there is a victory there is a victory
[1:53:02] in serving jesus christ there
[1:53:06] is a victory it's what gives a mother
[1:53:09] the grace to bury her child it's what
[1:53:12] gives a wife
[1:53:14] the grace to bury her husband knowing
[1:53:17] that there is a victory there is an
[1:53:20] overcomer
[1:53:21] there is a resurrection that lives
[1:53:24] inside of us it's a temporary
[1:53:29] goodbye come on now
[1:53:32] i know some folks that are going through
[1:53:35] it
[1:53:36] really in the heat of the pain
[1:53:40] and the grief that goes with loss
[1:53:43] and i know some that are overcoming
[1:53:46] because and i pray all will
[1:53:48] but they can't all can't all can't
[1:53:51] overcome that way
[1:53:52] because it's only when you have the holy
[1:53:55] ghost in you
[1:53:56] that you have the overcoming power and
[1:53:58] it's only when you learn to cooperate
[1:54:00] with him
[1:54:05] i mean fully participate with him
[1:54:09] in your strength whoo
[1:54:13] you know for some of us if we should
[1:54:15] lose our complaints
[1:54:18] we would lose our personality
[1:54:24] because we have developed an identity
[1:54:26] and a personality
[1:54:28] around our aches and pains around our
[1:54:30] shortnesses in life
[1:54:32] around our wounds our hurts and what
[1:54:33] we've experienced and if god should
[1:54:36] break through
[1:54:36] i feel him now if god should break
[1:54:39] through in us
[1:54:40] and bust us out of that prison we'd be
[1:54:43] new people
[1:54:45] we would be new people we would lose the
[1:54:49] need to tell
[1:54:50] somebody and we would have
[1:54:54] rather a testimony that glorifies
[1:54:58] christ and says you can't
[1:55:01] make it on your own but because the
[1:55:04] overcomer
[1:55:05] is in you whoa you can make it
[1:55:09] this is the record that god hath given
[1:55:11] to us eternal life
[1:55:13] and this life is in his son he that hath
[1:55:16] the son hath life
[1:55:18] and he that hath not the son of god hath
[1:55:20] not life
[1:55:22] so the first four of the seven offices
[1:55:24] or administrations of the holy spirit in
[1:55:26] our life
[1:55:27] work to create the very
[1:55:31] divine life of god
[1:55:34] in us we receive a deposit
[1:55:37] of that in the new birth we receive
[1:55:41] an immersion in that divine life by the
[1:55:44] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:55:46] but there is a developing process that
[1:55:49] takes place in
[1:55:50] us and i have been baptized with the
[1:55:52] holy ghost
[1:55:53] since i was seven years old i'm now 53
[1:55:56] years old you do the math
[1:55:58] he has been working in my life and i
[1:56:00] want you to know
[1:56:02] i am still so far so far
[1:56:05] from letting him have total sway
[1:56:10] i'm not bragging i'm telling you the
[1:56:13] bitter reality
[1:56:15] but here's where my hope is he didn't
[1:56:17] leave me
[1:56:19] when i failed to yield a certain part of
[1:56:22] who i am
[1:56:23] to him he said i'll just be patient
[1:56:26] hallelujah
[1:56:28] praise god you may not have any patience
[1:56:31] with me
[1:56:31] i may not have any patience with you but
[1:56:34] the holy ghost
[1:56:36] hallelujah he has patience
[1:56:40] with the believer he does
[1:56:43] he knows the battle he knows the battle
[1:56:49] he recognizes the struggle
[1:56:52] he knows that when you strive in the
[1:56:54] flesh and in the soul
[1:56:56] you are absolutely wearing yourself out
[1:56:58] but when you learn to pull in the spirit
[1:57:01] and push in the spirit did you know that
[1:57:05] in the spirit there's pulling and
[1:57:06] pushing
[1:57:08] yes so you you just worship your way
[1:57:12] i mean it better be the bible way and
[1:57:14] i'll worship my way the bible way
[1:57:16] and i don't understand all the time
[1:57:18] sometimes i don't understand why i've
[1:57:19] done what i've done
[1:57:20] sometimes i don't understand why my arms
[1:57:22] move a certain way my voice
[1:57:24] raises a certain way sound a certain
[1:57:26] sound come
[1:57:27] i don't understand it all but i know the
[1:57:29] work of the holy ghost is never done in
[1:57:31] my life
[1:57:31] he just keeps moving and working and in
[1:57:34] your life the same
[1:57:35] and oh what i see god doing let me just
[1:57:38] take a minute
[1:57:39] lord i want to thank you right now i
[1:57:41] want to thank you right now
[1:57:43] for what i know you're doing in the life
[1:57:45] of every believer
[1:57:46] every believer that will cooperate with
[1:57:48] you every believer that will participate
[1:57:51] with you thank you for having patience
[1:57:53] with us
[1:57:54] thank you for letting the holy ghost
[1:57:55] continue to work in us
[1:57:59] outward pushing pushing pushing from the
[1:58:03] inside out
[1:58:04] the holy ghost of god pushing from the
[1:58:06] inside out
[1:58:07] to pull us up into a higher position
[1:58:10] to make our feet like hein's feet to
[1:58:13] give us victory when there's no reason
[1:58:14] to have victory
[1:58:15] hallelujah to cause us to shout when
[1:58:18] everybody else thinks we ought to be
[1:58:19] mourning
[1:58:20] and weeping and groaning but the holy
[1:58:22] ghost comes
[1:58:24] [Music]
[1:58:25] whoa hallelujah
[1:58:29] hallelujah and then the other three
[1:58:32] offices that we'll talk about in the
[1:58:33] future
[1:58:34] they reveal the divine power that the
[1:58:36] holy spirit gives us
[1:58:38] as he governs our lives
[1:58:43] the first four work together in us
[1:58:47] all one holy ghost four different
[1:58:50] ministries
[1:58:51] all working together to create in us the
[1:58:54] life of christ
[1:58:56] form it in us i travail in birth the
[1:58:59] apostle said until christ
[1:59:02] is formed in you christ is being
[1:59:06] formed you with me christ is being
[1:59:09] formed
[1:59:10] in the life of the believer christ is
[1:59:14] being
[1:59:14] formed in us it didn't come all
[1:59:18] at one time his fullness you've got
[1:59:21] christ in you right now
[1:59:24] but he's not fully formed we are
[1:59:27] yielding ourselves and he is
[1:59:30] forming himself by the holy spirit
[1:59:33] forming himself in us by the holy spirit
[1:59:36] so the first four work together to
[1:59:38] create the divine life of god in us
[1:59:40] we should say to reproduce it
[1:59:44] to reproduce the life of christ in us
[1:59:47] and if we didn't say that reproduce we
[1:59:49] would say recreate
[1:59:51] because when you have the holy ghost
[1:59:52] you've got the life of christ
[1:59:54] the other three offices are there to
[1:59:56] govern to govern us
[1:59:59] how many of you want to thank him for
[2:00:01] the government of the god the very
[2:00:02] government of god
[2:00:03] the government of the holy spirit if he
[2:00:05] didn't put the governor on me sometime
[2:00:10] if the holy ghost didn't put the
[2:00:11] governor on you sometime
[2:00:13] why don't you listen to me
[2:00:17] if he didn't govern us sometime
[2:00:21] it's not been 24 hours since he had to
[2:00:23] govern me
[2:00:27] me and brother steve just to us
[2:00:30] he had to say whoa
[2:00:37] you ever been clicking along 70 miles an
[2:00:40] hour and the holy ghost slam on breaks
[2:00:43] thank you lord thank you holy ghost
[2:00:48] for putting on the brakes
[2:00:51] if i mess up like this what would i do
[2:00:56] if you didn't put your foot on the brake
[2:00:58] sometime
[2:00:59] and bring me to a complete halt
[2:01:02] some of you some of you like me you miss
[2:01:04] that sometime you override that sometime
[2:01:07] you get your screwdrivers out and you
[2:01:09] try to fix it
[2:01:10] you try to take the governor off because
[2:01:13] you can't run like you want to run you
[2:01:15] can't click along like you want to click
[2:01:16] along
[2:01:17] but sometimes you need to understand the
[2:01:19] holy spirit is slowing you down
[2:01:21] because there is a real cliff
[2:01:25] up your up the road from where you are
[2:01:26] right now and if you're clicking along
[2:01:28] too fast
[2:01:32] thank you lord for slowing us down when
[2:01:35] we don't know how to slow ourselves down
[2:01:37] so
[2:01:37] the last three offices he are governing
[2:01:41] the others are creating or recreating
[2:01:43] the life of christ in us the last three
[2:01:45] they govern our lives and help develop
[2:01:47] the character of christ
[2:01:49] in the believer because even though the
[2:01:52] life of christ is there
[2:01:54] it has to be developed and it is
[2:01:56] developed when we yield you know every
[2:01:58] time you yield to god you grow
[2:02:02] did you know every time you yield to him
[2:02:04] you're growing you are you're growing
[2:02:07] every time you say yes lord your way
[2:02:11] i can clearly see my way your way lord
[2:02:13] is a little sketchy
[2:02:19] but i'm going to choose your way
[2:02:23] you see i mean you and i can make a plan
[2:02:25] for the next three years
[2:02:27] the holy ghost can say no
[2:02:30] no and you've got to say yes to
[2:02:32] something you don't fully understand
[2:02:35] you've got to say no to something you
[2:02:36] understand and yes to something you
[2:02:38] don't understand
[2:02:39] but as long as you know the voice
[2:02:43] as long as you know the voice of the
[2:02:45] holy ghost you
[2:02:47] can trust him
[2:02:51] you can trust him you may not like
[2:02:54] brother like we read
[2:02:55] here tuesday night brother brahm said
[2:02:57] you may not be able to you know see
[2:02:59] perfection in me i may not be able to
[2:03:00] see perhaps
[2:03:01] we may not but oh we know whose hands
[2:03:04] we're in
[2:03:05] we know who we belong to
[2:03:08] you may not be able to get above me or i
[2:03:10] may struggle to get above you
[2:03:13] we have all kinds of things working
[2:03:15] against us in this hour
[2:03:17] and what we have to do is choose his way
[2:03:21] god help us god help us strengthen us
[2:03:26] he's the only one the holy ghost is the
[2:03:28] only one that can bring the believer
[2:03:31] to maturity and to true holiness
[2:03:35] i said true holiness that's what comes
[2:03:38] by the spirit
[2:03:39] as we learn to yield in obedience to the
[2:03:41] holy ghost in our lives
[2:03:43] we become more victorious and we can
[2:03:46] reign in life
[2:03:47] as god intended for us to reign we are
[2:03:50] being trained to reign
[2:03:52] even now and not just so that we can
[2:03:55] reign in eternity
[2:03:56] there's going to be an overcoming people
[2:03:59] just
[2:04:00] prior to the rapture of the bride
[2:04:02] there's going to be a people
[2:04:03] who operate in the overcoming power
[2:04:06] of the holy ghost that lives inside of
[2:04:09] them and christ is going to be fully
[2:04:12] formed
[2:04:12] in their lives did you hear me
[2:04:16] christ is going to be fully formed
[2:04:20] fully mature in their lives he's there
[2:04:25] wake up your neighbor he's there
[2:04:28] but not fully formed it takes life
[2:04:33] it takes hills and tunnels and valleys
[2:04:35] and
[2:04:36] mountains and it takes rejections it
[2:04:39] takes
[2:04:41] hurt feelings it takes fire
[2:04:47] sometimes it takes misunderstandings
[2:04:50] to put us in a place where we can learn
[2:04:52] to trust
[2:04:56] amen because we treat our heavenly
[2:04:58] father by what we know of our earthly
[2:05:00] fathers
[2:05:01] and that hinders us and it can hinder us
[2:05:03] all of our life if we let it
[2:05:06] come on now look flesh and blood is
[2:05:08] going to fail you
[2:05:10] if you let somebody get too high up on a
[2:05:12] pedestal in your life god knows how to
[2:05:14] bring them down
[2:05:15] he knows how to thump them off of that
[2:05:17] pedestal
[2:05:18] either in their own life or in your eyes
[2:05:23] so that you will learn to put your trust
[2:05:24] in him
[2:05:26] i believe that's why we have found some
[2:05:28] little things in the message of the hour
[2:05:30] where stories might be told a little
[2:05:32] different or the details
[2:05:33] might be a little different and we might
[2:05:35] that might throw some people off and
[2:05:37] cause them not to believe anymore
[2:05:39] but it helps us to look to the one who
[2:05:41] who we were to be introduced to
[2:05:43] it helps us to look to jesus we're not
[2:05:46] looking to eliezer
[2:05:47] we're looking to our husband come on now
[2:05:51] and if god if god can use an imperfect
[2:05:54] uh
[2:05:55] vessel one generation ago
[2:05:58] i'm just telling you what he said about
[2:05:59] himself this is not to reflect on any
[2:06:02] anyway on brother brown's character
[2:06:03] because his character
[2:06:05] had been refined by the fire of god
[2:06:08] but as i've told you before he did not
[2:06:10] have the gift of perfect recall
[2:06:14] and sometimes there would be a little
[2:06:15] detail missing or one added or something
[2:06:18] two stories run together and now that
[2:06:20] people have such access on the internet
[2:06:22] they come back and say well i guess he
[2:06:24] was just making it up as he went
[2:06:26] my my my you mean you can be a human and
[2:06:29] make all the mistakes you make
[2:06:33] you mean i can get upset with brother
[2:06:35] billy for not being out here when the
[2:06:36] rest of the parents are being seated
[2:06:40] and then find out he had another job
[2:06:43] you mean we can make mistakes like this
[2:06:46] and be okay
[2:06:47] but not allow somebody else to be human
[2:06:50] and make mistakes
[2:06:51] god wants you to see he wants you to see
[2:06:54] what he can do with imperfect flesh
[2:06:58] because brother branham unlike jesus
[2:07:00] christ
[2:07:01] he did not have a god-given
[2:07:04] egg and a god-given sperm
[2:07:11] that made his very birth perfection god
[2:07:14] jesus christ
[2:07:14] birth was perfection because
[2:07:18] mary knew no man brother branham is very
[2:07:20] quick to tell you how he was born
[2:07:22] he was born because of a sexual union
[2:07:25] that took place between charles and elle
[2:07:27] branham
[2:07:28] the egg that formed the prophet was that
[2:07:30] which was formed by the
[2:07:32] by the body of of elebranum and the
[2:07:34] sperm
[2:07:35] that that fertilized that egg and caused
[2:07:38] a baby to be formed in that womb
[2:07:41] that was a a deposit from mr charles
[2:07:45] branham
[2:07:46] but the vessel that was created was one
[2:07:49] that god had chosen
[2:07:51] like yours before the foundation of the
[2:07:54] world
[2:07:55] to use in outstanding ways
[2:07:59] that vessel like your vessel has to be
[2:08:02] redeemed
[2:08:03] has to be justified has to be sanctified
[2:08:06] has to be filled with the holy ghost no
[2:08:09] one is born in perfection
[2:08:11] we are all formed to perfection
[2:08:14] and it's the work of the holy spirit if
[2:08:16] you're with me say man
[2:08:18] it's 106. i didn't tell you to stay up
[2:08:21] till 2 a.m
[2:08:23] john 14 16
[2:08:27] and i will pray the father
[2:08:31] and he shall give you another comforter
[2:08:35] that he may abide with you forever
[2:08:41] and you know what they say see
[2:08:44] see there's the trinity
[2:08:48] see jesus praying to the father
[2:08:53] to send the holy ghost if that verse was
[2:08:56] the only verse
[2:08:58] in the words of jesus in john you might
[2:09:02] come away with a
[2:09:04] limp limping understanding like that
[2:09:08] but you've got to lay it in with
[2:09:09] everything else he said can you say amen
[2:09:12] we've already covered that in this study
[2:09:13] already the last few weeks
[2:09:15] so this is not three different people
[2:09:17] praying
[2:09:18] this is three offices of the one god
[2:09:21] interacting with one another as they do
[2:09:24] even now
[2:09:26] interacting with one another i will pray
[2:09:27] the father jesus said red letter
[2:09:29] and he shall give you another comforter
[2:09:31] that he may abide with you
[2:09:33] forever he's not going to leave us now
[2:09:37] and when you look at that word another
[2:09:39] it's very powerful
[2:09:41] when you look at that word another in
[2:09:43] the greek it's alos
[2:09:47] it means another but of the same kind
[2:09:53] it means another but of the same
[2:09:56] substance
[2:09:59] it's marking secession
[2:10:05] jesus is saying i have been a comfort to
[2:10:07] you
[2:10:09] while i was here in the flesh but i'm
[2:10:11] going to leave
[2:10:13] and i'm praying the father that he will
[2:10:16] send you
[2:10:16] another deposit
[2:10:21] but of the same kind
[2:10:24] marking secession meaning
[2:10:27] you had me now you will have another
[2:10:30] deposit of me
[2:10:32] [Music]
[2:10:34] it will operate in a different way
[2:10:37] it's not suggesting an entirely
[2:10:39] different substance
[2:10:41] but it is rather indicating the next
[2:10:43] installment
[2:10:45] numerically your first comfort was
[2:10:49] jesus your next comfort is going to be
[2:10:52] the holy ghost who will be an advocate
[2:10:57] and who will live inside of you oh i
[2:10:59] wish you could stay awake
[2:11:04] he lives inside of us
[2:11:08] number one would you write this down
[2:11:09] notetakers
[2:11:12] the first office of the holy spirit that
[2:11:15] we're going to talk about in this study
[2:11:17] together
[2:11:17] is the spirit of life
[2:11:20] the spirit of life and it is the
[2:11:23] ministry
[2:11:24] of the spirit of life i'll show you the
[2:11:26] bible for it
[2:11:28] it is the ministry of the spirit of life
[2:11:31] to create in you
[2:11:32] god's divine life
[2:11:36] that is a part of what the holy ghost
[2:11:39] does
[2:11:40] in the life of the believer i'm going to
[2:11:43] take just a few more moments here it's
[2:11:45] 110.
[2:11:46] i'll try to let you out a little earlier
[2:11:48] today
[2:11:50] because i think if you're getting your
[2:11:51] nap now
[2:11:54] you might miss what the lord would say
[2:11:56] to you and i'd rather
[2:11:57] uh not just throw this out there and let
[2:12:00] it fall on the deaf ear
[2:12:02] but i want to read at least a little bit
[2:12:04] more
[2:12:06] number one the spirit of life romans
[2:12:09] chapter eight
[2:12:11] verse one and two we just read verse one
[2:12:13] recently
[2:12:14] let's look at it again there is
[2:12:17] therefore now
[2:12:19] no remember the work of the holy ghost
[2:12:23] is not to condemn
[2:12:24] his work is to convict there is
[2:12:27] therefore now
[2:12:28] no condemnation to them which are in
[2:12:31] christ
[2:12:32] jesus who walk not after the flesh
[2:12:37] read it for me but after the spirit
[2:12:41] for the law of the
[2:12:45] there it is for the law
[2:12:48] of the spirit of life in christ
[2:12:52] jesus have made me free
[2:12:56] from the law of sin and death
[2:12:59] the spirit of life in christ jesus
[2:13:02] that's one of the offices or
[2:13:05] administrations
[2:13:06] or executions of the work of the holy
[2:13:09] ghost in you
[2:13:10] he operates in us as the spirit
[2:13:14] of life now the spirit of
[2:13:18] life is not a separate spirit
[2:13:21] it's all by the holy spirit it's just a
[2:13:25] ministry
[2:13:26] or an office of the holy spirit but
[2:13:29] where would you be without the spirit of
[2:13:31] life
[2:13:32] for the law of the spirit of life do you
[2:13:35] remember
[2:13:36] uh you that are with me do you remember
[2:13:39] a few weeks ago we we did a quick study
[2:13:43] on the three kinds of life
[2:13:47] that are mentioned in the new testament
[2:13:49] we talked about them we gave
[2:13:51] scripture for them i won't go over it i
[2:13:53] i copied it into my notes again but i
[2:13:56] won't go over it all
[2:13:57] with you again but remember there were
[2:13:59] three major
[2:14:00] words that are translated life in the
[2:14:03] new testament
[2:14:04] and they were bios suki
[2:14:07] and zoe do you remember that at all and
[2:14:10] bios
[2:14:11] was the physical body and it's the life
[2:14:15] of the physical
[2:14:16] and it's where we get our word biology
[2:14:19] and the suke that is the psychological
[2:14:23] life of the human soul
[2:14:25] that's where we get the word psychology
[2:14:27] and there are times that that word
[2:14:30] appears and i i might could just
[2:14:33] give you one example matthew 16 25 for
[2:14:36] whosoever will save his
[2:14:37] life success he shall lose it and
[2:14:41] whosoever will lose his life
[2:14:43] for my sake shall find it that is life
[2:14:47] of the mind
[2:14:48] of the emotion of the will and then
[2:14:51] thirdly when we see the word life in the
[2:14:54] new testament
[2:14:54] sometimes more often than not it is the
[2:14:57] greek
[2:14:58] word zoe which is a life
[2:15:01] that is given to us through the lord
[2:15:03] jesus christ
[2:15:04] it is a life that is uncreated it
[2:15:08] is the uncreated eternal life of god
[2:15:11] it is the divine life possessed
[2:15:15] by god now do you remember that study we
[2:15:18] did that just
[2:15:18] just a few weeks ago a month or two ago
[2:15:20] i don't remember exactly how long ago it
[2:15:22] was
[2:15:23] so now we just read romans 8 1-2
[2:15:27] and verse 2 says for the law of the
[2:15:29] spirit of
[2:15:30] life spirit of life
[2:15:33] which life do you think that is would
[2:15:36] that be bios
[2:15:37] physical life would that be or flesh
[2:15:40] life we could say
[2:15:41] would that be suke which is
[2:15:44] psychological or life of the mind will
[2:15:46] in the emotion
[2:15:47] or would that be zoe eternal uncreated
[2:15:50] life of god
[2:15:51] it's zoe it's zoe the spirit of life
[2:15:56] is zoey it's understanding that the holy
[2:16:00] ghost
[2:16:01] is recreating in us the life of christ
[2:16:06] the zoe divine life of god
[2:16:09] uncreated no one created that life
[2:16:14] it was of god it came from the great
[2:16:16] fountain of light
[2:16:17] it came from the beginning you can read
[2:16:19] about brother branham's understandings
[2:16:21] of the creation
[2:16:23] and how the logos came forth it's
[2:16:25] powerful
[2:16:26] and it lines up with the word
[2:16:30] and i love that can i
[2:16:33] read now romans 8 10 and 11.
[2:16:37] and i know i think i know now where i'll
[2:16:39] stop i'll stop
[2:16:40] shortly no no no i know
[2:16:43] i know sister joyce that you'd be here
[2:16:51] and you'd be awake
[2:16:55] 10 and 11. and if and also know
[2:17:00] that you're one of those that if you
[2:17:01] miss a service you catch up
[2:17:04] and i appreciate that very much i don't
[2:17:06] ever have to go back and say to brother
[2:17:08] greeley did you hear that did you
[2:17:09] did you what'd you think of that because
[2:17:11] he does
[2:17:12] why because he wants to stay up
[2:17:15] with where we are and where we're going
[2:17:18] i advise you to do the same
[2:17:20] there's a lot of things out there that
[2:17:22] catch our attention and i don't feel bad
[2:17:23] to ask you
[2:17:24] to catch up on a service that you miss
[2:17:27] because i know you're
[2:17:28] going to spend time on youtube i know
[2:17:29] you're going to spend time on on
[2:17:31] podcasts i know you're going to spend
[2:17:33] time on other things during the week
[2:17:34] and it would certainly be helpful
[2:17:36] especially in a study that lays line
[2:17:38] upon line like this
[2:17:40] if you happen to miss something you just
[2:17:41] go back and catch it and i'll just
[2:17:43] mention for you that are here
[2:17:44] the the the uh wedding i started saying
[2:17:46] the graduation
[2:17:47] the wedding is is on the app already and
[2:17:50] uh we did stream
[2:17:52] and there were some people who said that
[2:17:53] they had a problem i think that must
[2:17:54] have been on their end
[2:17:56] because we didn't have any problem on
[2:17:57] our end and even if you missed some of
[2:17:59] it
[2:18:00] all you have to do now it's already on
[2:18:01] the app you can see it it's right up
[2:18:02] there printed very
[2:18:04] very easy to follow if you want to go
[2:18:06] back and watch it or if you have
[2:18:07] somebody
[2:18:08] maybe a family member that didn't get to
[2:18:10] stream you can
[2:18:11] god has been good to us to give us this
[2:18:14] technology
[2:18:15] that we can hold it in the palm of our
[2:18:17] hand
[2:18:18] and we had been given permission to put
[2:18:22] drew green's a cd on he's a cowboy
[2:18:25] singer it's brother green's uh
[2:18:26] a grandson it's his only project and we
[2:18:29] had been given
[2:18:30] permission uh a year or more ago to put
[2:18:33] his
[2:18:34] a cd on there for people who like that
[2:18:36] country sound of
[2:18:37] of gospel music and i do on occasion i
[2:18:39] really do
[2:18:40] and uh the the need came up that one of
[2:18:44] the
[2:18:44] one of the relatives was in the hospital
[2:18:46] in real bad shape
[2:18:48] and they had been listening to sister
[2:18:49] green's cd on our app
[2:18:51] and so uh they sent a note and said do
[2:18:54] you think you might be able to get that
[2:18:55] up for us
[2:18:56] so that we could uh so that the relative
[2:18:58] could hear it in the
[2:19:00] in the icu and we were able to do that
[2:19:02] just like that
[2:19:03] rj jumped right on it and got it done
[2:19:06] and that was
[2:19:06] able to play maybe in that room and be a
[2:19:09] blessing in god good to us
[2:19:11] to give us technology like that okay
[2:19:13] back to it now
[2:19:14] verse 10 and 11. same chapter romans 8
[2:19:18] and if christ be in you
[2:19:23] the body is dead because of sin
[2:19:27] here you are walking around
[2:19:31] dead men walking
[2:19:34] because the body is dead because of sin
[2:19:37] but the spirit is
[2:19:41] life because of righteousness
[2:19:45] do you think that's bios life you think
[2:19:48] that's biology life
[2:19:50] you think that's botany life you do you
[2:19:53] think that is suikey life
[2:19:55] you think that's life psychology life
[2:19:57] the mind live
[2:19:58] no no no no but the spirit is
[2:20:02] zoe but the spirit is divine life
[2:20:07] but the spirit is uncreated life
[2:20:10] because of righteousness whose
[2:20:15] verse 11 but if the spirit
[2:20:18] whoa
[2:20:21] if the spirit of him
[2:20:24] that raised up jesus from the dead
[2:20:28] dwell in you do you think that's bios
[2:20:32] life
[2:20:36] no no no no no this
[2:20:39] is spirit life zoe life
[2:20:43] divine life eternal life
[2:20:46] uncreated life resurrection life
[2:20:50] if the spirit of him that raised
[2:20:53] up jesus from the dead dwell in you
[2:20:56] he that raised up christ from the dead
[2:21:00] shall also quicken here you are walking
[2:21:02] around in a dead body
[2:21:04] but because of sin but that resurrection
[2:21:07] life
[2:21:07] shall quicken your mortal body
[2:21:11] by his spirit that dwelleth in you
[2:21:14] now i know that's blessed hope
[2:21:18] for a resurrection out there but that's
[2:21:21] not all that is
[2:21:23] don't you think you have to be graveyard
[2:21:26] dead
[2:21:27] to experience resurrection life
[2:21:30] when you receive the holy ghost one of
[2:21:32] his offices in your life
[2:21:34] is to administer to you
[2:21:38] to execute to you the life of
[2:21:41] christ which is resurrection life
[2:21:44] so even right now in a body dead because
[2:21:48] of sin
[2:21:49] you are walking around with a
[2:21:51] resurrection on the inside of you
[2:21:53] whoa i've got a resurrection inside of
[2:21:55] me i've got a resurrection inside of me
[2:21:58] i have a resurrection living inside of
[2:22:00] me hallelujah
[2:22:01] praise god so don't worry
[2:22:05] don't worry if you lay this down
[2:22:09] if you watch this leaving don't worry
[2:22:13] there's a resurrection inside of me
[2:22:16] there's a resurrection inside of me
[2:22:18] there's a part of me that will never die
[2:22:21] there's a part of me that's already
[2:22:22] eternal hallelujah
[2:22:25] we just change robes death is just a
[2:22:29] doorway
[2:22:30] hallelujah you really believe that if i
[2:22:32] didn't i couldn't face my
[2:22:34] i couldn't face the reality of how close
[2:22:36] 60s getting
[2:22:41] how old was chris you remember the one
[2:22:44] who passed away
[2:22:46] a friend in new brunswick
[2:22:52] lake alberta in the front line church
[2:22:55] there
[2:22:56] the last time i saw him he said to me
[2:23:00] when i grow up i want to be like you
[2:23:03] and i said that's good when i grow up i
[2:23:06] want to have a beard like yours
[2:23:09] it's it was epic he had the most tender
[2:23:12] spirit
[2:23:13] kind young man worked in the sound was a
[2:23:16] blessing to so many people
[2:23:18] we're seeing really what an effect he
[2:23:20] had on
[2:23:21] lots of different groups and churches
[2:23:22] and just a real
[2:23:24] nice spirit about him
[2:23:27] and he was on the way somewhere on a
[2:23:31] motorcycle
[2:23:32] and tragically crashed and lost his life
[2:23:35] and there's a church in a family that's
[2:23:37] grieving
[2:23:38] i don't know what the results of the of
[2:23:40] the accident out here but
[2:23:41] by the time we got there the wreck was
[2:23:43] cleared and they were hauling off the
[2:23:45] three motorbikes
[2:23:46] two on one truck and one on another i
[2:23:48] don't know if anybody died i don't know
[2:23:50] if i was
[2:23:51] hurt but i'm telling you it could have
[2:23:53] been just
[2:23:55] it's like that this young man had rode a
[2:23:57] motorcycle his whole life
[2:23:59] and so it's just that it's just that
[2:24:00] moment some people call it a freak
[2:24:02] accident
[2:24:03] i don't believe that believers are taken
[2:24:05] out of here by such
[2:24:07] it's divine appointments it may look
[2:24:09] freakish it may look like fate it may
[2:24:11] look like
[2:24:12] just an accident but oh my god knows
[2:24:15] he knew when i was born the day i was
[2:24:17] going to leave here
[2:24:20] he knew he knew and so you don't have to
[2:24:23] be old
[2:24:26] you don't have to be old but if you've
[2:24:29] got a resurrection life living on the
[2:24:31] inside of you you're just changing
[2:24:33] bodies
[2:24:34] you're just changing robes thank you for
[2:24:37] helping me
[2:24:38] if that spirit that raised jeep now look
[2:24:41] the spirit of life that was in verse 10
[2:24:44] is zoe life that word life
[2:24:47] is zoe because of righteousness but if
[2:24:50] the spirit of him that raised up jesus
[2:24:52] from the dead dwell in you
[2:24:53] he that raised up christ from the dead
[2:24:55] shall also quicken
[2:24:56] your mortal body by his spirit that
[2:24:58] dwelleth in you
[2:24:59] now before we close when the when the
[2:25:03] bible when the scriptures refer
[2:25:05] to the holy spirit as the spirit of
[2:25:08] something they signify
[2:25:12] that the holy spirit is the executor
[2:25:16] or the office of
[2:25:19] the spirit being named
[2:25:22] so if we say the spirit of life
[2:25:26] life is being ministered in you
[2:25:31] by the work of the holy spirit you
[2:25:33] understand
[2:25:35] it's the holy spirit it's the holy ghost
[2:25:37] it's him he's one
[2:25:39] but one of the things that he
[2:25:40] accomplishes in our life is he brings to
[2:25:43] us the spirit
[2:25:44] of life the breath of god
[2:25:48] and that's pretty powerful isn't it now
[2:25:51] you want to jot this down you probably
[2:25:53] won't have time because i'm going to go
[2:25:54] too quick
[2:25:56] but i'm going to read to you the rest of
[2:25:59] these
[2:26:00] so that you might be able to just know
[2:26:02] where we're going number two the spirit
[2:26:03] of truth
[2:26:05] number three the spirit of adoption
[2:26:07] number four the spirit of holiness
[2:26:09] number five the spirit of grace number
[2:26:12] six the spirit of supplication
[2:26:14] and number seven the spirit of glory
[2:26:17] now every one of those words
[2:26:20] ministries are referred to in the new
[2:26:23] testament as the spirit of
[2:26:26] the spirit of truth the spirit of
[2:26:28] adoption
[2:26:29] the spirit of life the spirit of
[2:26:33] supplication
[2:26:36] and but it's all by the same holy spirit
[2:26:41] it's just one of the works that he
[2:26:44] accomplishes
[2:26:46] in our lives and i don't know about you
[2:26:48] but i'm very
[2:26:50] very thankful for the life
[2:26:53] that's dwelling inside of me if you can
[2:26:56] understand that say amen
[2:26:59] let me just give you one more
[2:27:02] john 1 4 and 5.
[2:27:06] in him was life
[2:27:09] what life do you think that was zoe
[2:27:12] in him was zoe and the life
[2:27:16] zoe was the light of men do you remember
[2:27:19] we talked about this not too long ago
[2:27:21] in fact we it was when we were doing the
[2:27:23] study on bios
[2:27:25] on success
[2:27:29] him was life and the life
[2:27:33] was the light of men and the light
[2:27:37] shineth in darkness and the darkness
[2:27:40] comprehended it not would you give me
[2:27:43] the
[2:27:44] quote please there is a man here that
[2:27:46] can turn on the light
[2:27:49] we had this quote not too long ago but
[2:27:52] here it is again
[2:27:54] there's no two or three lights
[2:27:57] said remember the verse said in him was
[2:28:00] life and the life
[2:28:01] was the light of men there's no two or
[2:28:04] three lights
[2:28:04] no four or five different organizations
[2:28:06] there was one light
[2:28:08] there's not methodist baptist lutheran
[2:28:10] presbyterian
[2:28:12] christ is the light and the light
[2:28:15] is the life that's just what the word
[2:28:19] said
[2:28:20] and the life was the light of men he
[2:28:22] said and the word
[2:28:24] manifested is the light
[2:28:27] of the hour the word
[2:28:30] manifested is the light of the hour
[2:28:34] you know what makes this hour so bright
[2:28:37] when it's really so dark out there it's
[2:28:40] that the word
[2:28:41] is being manifested in this hour in the
[2:28:44] life of the believer
[2:28:47] it's not producing a national revival
[2:28:50] it's producing an individual revival
[2:28:54] come on now it's producing an individual
[2:28:57] harvest
[2:28:58] right now you're being harvested
[2:29:01] as a son of god you're being raised up
[2:29:05] by the spirit of his life to be able to
[2:29:08] overcome
[2:29:09] the pressures and problems that you're
[2:29:12] going to face here
[2:29:13] until we make the change the change
[2:29:17] is taking place even now
[2:29:20] it is it's impossible to sit under the
[2:29:24] light of the hour
[2:29:26] and not be changed it's impossible to
[2:29:29] sit under the spirit of life
[2:29:32] and not be changed and remember where
[2:29:34] that comes from it comes from the word
[2:29:36] the word before it was written was
[2:29:39] living
[2:29:41] and the spirit of life is what comes
[2:29:44] to take that written word and transform
[2:29:47] it
[2:29:48] it's not transformed between me and you
[2:29:52] i speak it and a transformation takes
[2:29:54] place and it
[2:29:55] and it gets in you as living word that's
[2:29:58] not how it happens
[2:29:59] you hear the the retelling
[2:30:02] of the written word and because the
[2:30:05] spirit of life
[2:30:06] resides in you the spirit of life
[2:30:10] produces an awareness
[2:30:13] that brings to your spirit man
[2:30:16] a revelation of the living word
[2:30:19] and that's what makes it personal if we
[2:30:22] could only get you as the musicians are
[2:30:25] coming
[2:30:26] if we can only get you to understand
[2:30:29] that more god is doing more
[2:30:32] for you than you see with a natural eye
[2:30:37] you you feel so discouraged sometime
[2:30:41] because you're so stuck
[2:30:47] still on a vicious cycle
[2:30:50] repeated behaviors repeated bad habit
[2:30:54] repeated this repeated bad thoughts
[2:30:56] repeat and you're so caught in that
[2:30:59] cycle and that old condemner
[2:31:01] that old accuser just screamed at you
[2:31:03] see you're nothing god's not doing
[2:31:04] anything to you
[2:31:05] you know you don't belong to god you
[2:31:06] don't have the holy ghost you ever hear
[2:31:08] that
[2:31:12] i've i've said this before and i don't
[2:31:14] want to brag
[2:31:16] because he tells me plenty
[2:31:19] he lies to me just like he lies to you
[2:31:23] but i have to tell you i've whipped him
[2:31:25] on one
[2:31:26] one lie i've whipped him
[2:31:32] he never tries to tell me anymore
[2:31:36] that i don't have the baptism of the
[2:31:37] holy ghost
[2:31:39] i whupped him on that one which one have
[2:31:42] you whipped him on
[2:31:45] there's a way to whoop him
[2:31:49] and you know what i found sometime we
[2:31:51] get caught in a vicious trap
[2:31:53] trying to talk to him
[2:31:56] oh he's a great sophist you'll never
[2:31:59] out-talk the devil
[2:32:02] he's an orator who loves the sound of
[2:32:04] his voice
[2:32:06] and he's not happy if it if it's not
[2:32:08] carrying through the room
[2:32:09] so that everyone can hear him that's the
[2:32:11] enemy that's how the enemy operates
[2:32:14] he loves to talk and so you're never
[2:32:18] going to win an argument
[2:32:20] with the devil you don't have to
[2:32:25] you just have to know once the knowing
[2:32:29] strikes your life by revelation
[2:32:32] there's a lot of things that i have not
[2:32:35] yet had made personal to me yet
[2:32:37] after serving the lord all these years
[2:32:39] there's truths
[2:32:40] that i preach that i have not yet walked
[2:32:43] out
[2:32:44] in the fullness that i want to walk them
[2:32:45] out lots of them i'm not ashamed to tell
[2:32:48] you
[2:32:48] lots of them and you could say well
[2:32:51] then you have no right who will then
[2:32:55] who will you go find him
[2:32:59] you go find the man because never mind i
[2:33:02] won't go there but you go find him
[2:33:07] and then look at his life how many wives
[2:33:13] how many how much of that how many to
[2:33:15] the other
[2:33:16] and you'll find that to say it is not
[2:33:19] always to do
[2:33:20] it and i can tell you there are many
[2:33:22] many many things
[2:33:24] that i don't walk in the fullness of
[2:33:26] that i declare
[2:33:27] with boldness and faith because i've
[2:33:30] seen enough of it to know
[2:33:31] if god can do it and rotten me even in a
[2:33:34] part he can fulfill his word
[2:33:37] if i keep trusting him so don't you let
[2:33:39] the enemy back you into that corner
[2:33:42] you speak the truth let me tell you what
[2:33:45] i have found to be quite effective at
[2:33:47] times
[2:33:48] once you get a revelation that for
[2:33:51] instance you have received the baptism i
[2:33:53] have a revelation just let me share this
[2:33:54] with you
[2:33:55] personally as we close i have a
[2:33:57] revelation that i have received the
[2:33:59] genuine baptism of the holy ghost you
[2:34:02] could not tell me and me believe you
[2:34:05] that i don't
[2:34:06] i just want you to know that there's a
[2:34:08] lot of things you can say that affect me
[2:34:10] and you do and they do but that is not
[2:34:14] one of them
[2:34:16] because that's one that i have a
[2:34:18] personal revelation of
[2:34:20] and the enemy used to come with that lie
[2:34:24] see i grew up in pentecost and i've told
[2:34:27] you before that if i call my grandmother
[2:34:29] and she didn't answer the phone
[2:34:30] fear would strike my heart i'd fall on
[2:34:32] my face i thought i had missed the
[2:34:33] rapture
[2:34:35] because granny didn't answer the phone
[2:34:37] so i thought for sure i know i had a bad
[2:34:40] thought
[2:34:40] so i'm sure the rapture has taken place
[2:34:42] and i'm left here to
[2:34:43] to go through the tribulation that was
[2:34:46] what
[2:34:47] church entity was producing in my life
[2:34:50] then i found the message
[2:34:52] so don't you come around here telling me
[2:34:53] not to call brother branham's name
[2:34:58] there's a church on every corner you can
[2:35:00] go to and not hear about it
[2:35:03] they'll cut god up in three pieces and
[2:35:05] try to feed him to you and they will be
[2:35:07] glad to baptize you in
[2:35:08] a in a false doctrine they'll be glad to
[2:35:11] baptize
[2:35:12] you in titles even though we know
[2:35:14] there's no salvation in titles it only
[2:35:16] comes in the name
[2:35:17] that's what the word said they'll be
[2:35:19] glad to do that so i'm not going to
[2:35:21] apologize
[2:35:22] for presenting the message that changed
[2:35:24] my life
[2:35:26] when the message came when the truth of
[2:35:29] this message
[2:35:30] came i went from that place of i'm oh no
[2:35:34] granny's gone she didn't answer the
[2:35:36] phone i must have missed the rapture i
[2:35:38] went to that place
[2:35:39] after receiving a revelation i have the
[2:35:41] holy ghost how could there be a
[2:35:43] how could there be a rapture and may not
[2:35:46] be in it
[2:35:47] if the requirement to go is to have the
[2:35:49] genuine baptism of the holy oath
[2:35:52] so brother branham said you come to a
[2:35:53] place where you say there could be no
[2:35:55] rapture
[2:35:56] without me in it somebody said doesn't
[2:35:59] that sound like pride
[2:36:00] it does to those who have no revelation
[2:36:03] but you see it's not
[2:36:04] me it's not me that's rapture worthy
[2:36:11] i can tell you several ways why
[2:36:15] me and my soul are not rapture worthy
[2:36:20] but i am not being evaluated on my
[2:36:23] worthiness
[2:36:27] i am being evaluated by the blood
[2:36:30] that has been laid on my life
[2:36:34] and the holy ghost that now lives inside
[2:36:37] of me
[2:36:38] and you and you and you this is how god
[2:36:42] looks at us
[2:36:44] god you know we go right back to
[2:36:48] the prophet and david
[2:36:52] man looks on the outward appearance man
[2:36:54] will judge you by their preconceived
[2:36:56] ideas of who you are
[2:36:58] god sees who you really are
[2:37:02] you will never be able to convince some
[2:37:04] people that you don't have a motive
[2:37:06] an agenda for everything you do or say
[2:37:10] so just quit trying to fool them quit
[2:37:13] trying to please them
[2:37:15] don't even worry about those kinds of
[2:37:16] things in this hour be sincere
[2:37:19] be real be honest before god
[2:37:23] don't think that you can win an argument
[2:37:26] with the enemy once you get a revelation
[2:37:30] for instance
[2:37:30] i have the baptism holy ghost once you
[2:37:33] have a revelation of that
[2:37:35] the best thing to do is ignore his lie
[2:37:42] just ignore his lie you'd be surprised
[2:37:45] if you don't entertain his lie
[2:37:47] he eventually will stop telling you that
[2:37:49] stupid lie
[2:37:51] watch it and if you just can't be quiet
[2:37:53] because some people can't
[2:37:57] just give him the word
[2:38:00] just answer him like jesus did the word
[2:38:03] but you can win in a struggle with the
[2:38:06] enemy
[2:38:07] once you have a revelation you just
[2:38:09] don't entertain his lie anymore
[2:38:11] have you ever said to somebody i know
[2:38:13] you're talking about i can't hear what
[2:38:14] you're saying
[2:38:17] you're just holding up the word of god
[2:38:19] the truth of the
[2:38:20] revelation of the message of jesus
[2:38:22] christ you're just holding that up
[2:38:24] toward your enemy and you're saying i i
[2:38:26] know you're talking but i can't hear
[2:38:28] what you're saying
[2:38:30] because i've had a revelation of
[2:38:34] what lives who lives
[2:38:37] inside of me and he lives there
[2:38:40] as the spirit of life as the spirit of
[2:38:43] truth as the spirit of adoption
[2:38:45] he lives there as the spirit of
[2:38:47] supplication
[2:38:48] the spirit of grace the spirit of glory
[2:38:50] he
[2:38:51] lives in me as the spirit of holiness
[2:38:55] it's who he is transforming from the
[2:38:58] inside out
[2:38:59] who i am stand together would you
[2:39:03] we made it
[2:39:06] we made it this young man who passed
[2:39:08] away was 28
[2:39:10] my wife sent me a text he didn't leave
[2:39:14] one day earlier
[2:39:15] than what god saw he was going
[2:39:21] there may be those who sail him out
[2:39:23] celebrate him out
[2:39:24] i hope not but i know how charismatic
[2:39:28] can be sometime
[2:39:30] and some people may say oh the enemy was
[2:39:33] able to kill him
[2:39:35] but remember that places the enemy of
[2:39:38] god
[2:39:39] more powerful than the one who created
[2:39:41] him
[2:39:42] everything in me screams that's a lie
[2:39:45] everything in me screams that's a lie
[2:39:48] god had a plan does it hurt
[2:39:51] yeah yes it hurts
[2:39:55] you know what it feels like it hurts
[2:40:02] but we have a truth
[2:40:06] says there's there's something bigger
[2:40:09] there's a reality that's bigger than
[2:40:11] what we feel
[2:40:12] what we think what we see god's bigger
[2:40:14] than all that have you got something you
[2:40:16] can
[2:40:17] lead us in worship let me get my breath
[2:40:19] and strength
[2:40:23] he's good all the time how many of you'd
[2:40:26] like to worship with me for a few
[2:40:27] moments before we go today
[2:40:29] do it anyway do it anyway be a better
[2:40:33] worshiper than you were in a manner
[2:40:35] focus on him right now give him give him
[2:40:38] some attention
[2:40:39] let him know that it that it's because
[2:40:42] of him
[2:40:43] it's because of the spirit of life in
[2:40:45] you that you're able to get up and face
[2:40:47] face
[2:40:48] the obstacles that are before you maybe
[2:40:50] some of you're
[2:40:51] realizing that you've got some real
[2:40:53] stuff heading your way
[2:40:55] and it wears you out focus on him for
[2:40:58] just a few moments
[2:40:59] and let the spirit of the lord lift you
