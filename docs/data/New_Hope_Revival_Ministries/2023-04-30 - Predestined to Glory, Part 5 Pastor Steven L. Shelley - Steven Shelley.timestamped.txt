[36:31] I want to keep this same atmosphere it's
[36:33] good to be in the house Lord today we
[36:34] have a lot out missing but uh we
[36:37] appreciate y'all being here this morning
[36:38] you may be seated
[36:40] um we just want to go to the Lord in
[36:41] prayer if anyone has a prayer request by
[36:43] just the uplift uplifting of the hand
[36:45] which needs all over the building
[36:48] would you remember all of those who are
[36:51] traveling uh that God will watch over
[36:54] them and keep them brother and sister
[36:56] Greely in Virginia ministering to their
[36:59] families uh sister Judith in Michigan
[37:02] and then on her way to Canada want to
[37:05] hold her up to the Lord in prayer also
[37:08] Ben and Kendra and the girls and Josh
[37:10] and charity on a little bit of a holiday
[37:12] and then we want to uh and I'm so
[37:16] blessed that the Lord helped us in the
[37:18] worship it's very rare that all three
[37:20] guitar players are missing but you know
[37:23] with with these musicians it just
[37:26] carried well and I'm I'm relieved and
[37:28] thankful would you pray for Ashley
[37:31] she has transitioned to the hospital
[37:34] not not because there was an emergency
[37:37] uh the baby's heart rate is strong and
[37:41] she is strong but was getting tired and
[37:44] uh it appears that there was uh bone
[37:47] against bone and they couldn't quite
[37:50] clear and they have made it to the
[37:53] hospital they have done an ultrasound
[37:55] the doctor said everything is perfectly
[37:57] fine and we're just waiting on a good
[38:00] report that that she is here
[38:03] but let's pray for those who lost sleep
[38:06] during the night I know Emily was there
[38:08] and Sister Laura was there and my wife
[38:11] was there all through the night and I
[38:13] got to be there this morning from from
[38:16] for about an hour and a half and pray
[38:17] with them and uh their faith is strong
[38:20] and grandparents also I when I come out
[38:23] I saw brother Billy and brother Robert
[38:26] and sister Teresa I know they're in the
[38:28] waiting room some of them praying there
[38:30] and we just I hope before the service is
[38:33] over we have a news that this little
[38:36] baby girl is here so pray for all those
[38:39] involved or for strength especially for
[38:42] Ashley's body that she can just push
[38:45] this baby right out into life and uh for
[38:48] David uh if you've never been in that
[38:52] position that's the most vulnerable
[38:54] place to be and when you're of course a
[38:58] mother there's nothing like seeing a
[39:01] sister like that in that place but a
[39:04] husband you know a young husband it's
[39:07] hard and because you can't help there's
[39:09] not much you can do you can give ice
[39:12] chips and back rubs but that don't make
[39:15] you feel like you've done anything and
[39:17] so pray for David that God will also
[39:19] just give him peace and I know as soon
[39:22] as they see her
[39:24] then it'll be all right
[39:27] let's remember them this morning it's
[39:29] all standings are getting ready to pray
[39:35] remember Sister Audrey they were here
[39:38] Sunday and Tuesday night but she is
[39:41] suffering with cellulitis and it's in
[39:44] such a place around her ankles that
[39:46] she's having a hard time walking nikisha
[39:49] was here earlier dropped off food for
[39:51] the picnic and birthday cards for me I
[39:54] thought that was so sweet that they come
[39:55] all the way over here but they had to
[39:57] get back to see to take care of sister
[39:59] Audrey because brother Donovan was going
[40:01] to work let's ask the Lord to give her a
[40:04] miracle
[40:11] thank you
[40:12] [Music]
[40:15] no one else can touch my Heart Like You

[41:21] Hicks kind but she's uncomfortable she
[41:24] was hoping to come on in a little while
[41:25] or or either to go and be checked so we

[1:07:25] oh my
[1:07:28] I don't wanna I don't ever want to I've
[1:07:30] embarrassed Paul so many times and I
[1:07:32] don't ever want to be guilty of that
[1:07:34] but if you have a voice like his
[1:07:37] and you're you're somewhere where
[1:07:39] somebody like that is don't you want to
[1:07:41] hear him saying
[1:07:44] and uh well we love him sister West and
[1:07:47] Paul and I have sung
[1:07:50] hundreds of songs the same song
[1:07:55] we've sung about 30 I think we had 30 or
[1:07:58] 35 songs we we did in the 90s
[1:08:02] and early 2000s
[1:08:04] and literally the presence of God would
[1:08:06] come and sometimes we'd sing four hours
[1:08:11] people would worship and get saved and
[1:08:14] get healed and we we used to sing that
[1:08:16] he's here he is here hallelujah he is
[1:08:19] here
[1:08:20] the presence of God so real so that felt
[1:08:23] real good and Paul is very blessed I
[1:08:26] know it I know he would tell you if you
[1:08:28] ask him to be able to sing with his
[1:08:30] mother
[1:08:30] and we're so glad that sister West drove
[1:08:33] all the way down here from North Alabama
[1:08:34] to be with us
[1:08:36] on my birthday weekend
[1:08:39] [Applause]
[1:08:42] I'm not going to tell her age
[1:08:45] she tells it sometime but I'm not going
[1:08:47] to tell her age but I will tell you this
[1:08:50] I've been pastoring here a long time how
[1:08:53] many of you know that
[1:08:54] I can't get it right are you fixing it
[1:09:01] and we did a little math it took us a
[1:09:03] while took me a long time I didn't sleep
[1:09:05] in an hour last night
[1:09:07] and I'm feeling it
[1:09:09] that's better I think
[1:09:13] I slept from 12 to 1 and then I just
[1:09:15] couldn't sleep no more it was time to
[1:09:17] pray
[1:09:18] and uh
[1:09:19] but anyway we were doing a little math
[1:09:21] and we we calculated that she was 51 I'm
[1:09:24] 55 now she was 51.
[1:09:29] when she came here to church the first
[1:09:31] time and let's just say that was quite a
[1:09:33] few years ago
[1:09:35] and and how old was would brother West
[1:09:37] have been was he he was older
[1:09:40] couple years
[1:09:42] about three years older so he would have
[1:09:44] been closer to my age he would have been
[1:09:46] closer to 55. we're blessed to have her
[1:09:49] today I want to honor her one more time
[1:09:52] praise God
[1:09:55] praise the Lord
[1:09:57] and then let me check here just to see

[1:13:17] go together
[1:13:18] I still believe that the Lord is coming
[1:13:21] and the and the dead in Christ are going
[1:13:23] to rise first and we which are alive and
[1:13:26] remain if there's any doubt in your mind
[1:13:28] all you have to do is watch the news
[1:13:31] and you know this song that Paul sung is
[1:13:34] going to be reality one day one two
[1:13:36] living in a house one taking the other
[1:13:38] left
[1:13:39] you want to make sure that your your
[1:13:41] sins are under the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:13:44] somebody told me recently said I'm not
[1:13:46] worthy I'm not good enough I've been
[1:13:49] terrible I don't care how terrible
[1:13:51] somebody has been you may be watching
[1:13:54] this service today and you may have have
[1:13:57] committed in your mind the most hideous
[1:13:59] sin that anybody could ever commit but I
[1:14:02] want to tell you something the blood of
[1:14:03] Jesus and the grace of God doesn't
[1:14:06] matter how immoral it was or how cruel
[1:14:09] it was there's only one sin the Bible
[1:14:12] tells us is unforgivable and that's
[1:14:15] blasphemy that's making fun of the Holy
[1:14:18] Ghost that's calling the things of God
[1:14:20] giving credit to the devil for what God
[1:14:22] has done
[1:14:24] that's pretty serious business
[1:14:26] but other than that even murder and I
[1:14:29] don't encourage anybody to try that but
[1:14:32] there are people who have done it In the
[1:14:34] Heat of passion and I want you to know
[1:14:36] the same blood that saved you can save
[1:14:39] them
[1:14:41] how many of you believe the blood of
[1:14:43] Jesus is powerful enough
[1:14:45] to save The vilest Sinner
[1:14:49] I promise the Lord on the way over here
[1:14:51] if he tarried I would like to live at
[1:14:54] least another 30 years if he would give
[1:14:57] them to me in strong body and mind
[1:15:00] if it can't be that way I'm not sure I
[1:15:03] want to sign up
[1:15:04] but if he would give me that
[1:15:07] but however long he gives me I want to
[1:15:10] spend every day
[1:15:12] serving him I do I want to serve him I
[1:15:16] want to worship him I said Lord I want
[1:15:18] to do more for you
[1:15:19] in these next years than I've done in
[1:15:22] the ones before
[1:15:24] so it was kind of one of them you know
[1:15:26] mushy days for me and I got over here
[1:15:29] and had the privilege of being
[1:15:30] interviewed by by my second son and that
[1:15:34] only means by birth time it doesn't mean
[1:15:37] by by favorite that was one of the
[1:15:39] questions that they wanted to ask me in
[1:15:41] the interview who's your favorite child
[1:15:43] of the four well I don't have a favorite
[1:15:45] I like them all I I I anyway I better
[1:15:50] not go there
[1:15:52] okay you're ready to hear some preaching
[1:15:54] maybe Romans if you'll turn there for
[1:15:57] just a moment
[1:15:59] I want to go to Romans chapter 8 verse
[1:16:02] 27.
[1:16:04] 31.
[1:16:18] I had wonderful while they're getting
[1:16:21] that I had wonderful birthday greetings
[1:16:23] from all over the world I'm telling you
[1:16:25] I felt so blessed
[1:16:28] I I looked down at my phone one time on
[1:16:31] on Friday and there were 113 different
[1:16:34] texts
[1:16:35] from people who had texted me happy
[1:16:37] birthday and it's wonderful to feel
[1:16:40] loved and appreciated isn't it we all
[1:16:42] need that sometime so all of you
[1:16:45] everything you did I had presents
[1:16:47] brought to the office in there and um
[1:16:50] gifts and food and all kinds of
[1:16:53] wonderful things thank you so much
[1:16:55] I appreciate it from the bottom of my
[1:16:57] heart are you ready and hear that
[1:16:59] searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the
[1:17:03] mind of the spirit because he maketh
[1:17:07] intercession for the Saints according to
[1:17:11] the will of God
[1:17:12] and we know that all things I need you
[1:17:17] to say it
[1:17:18] all things good bad ugly all things work
[1:17:23] together for good
[1:17:25] just notice that doesn't say all things
[1:17:27] that happen are good
[1:17:29] they're not good
[1:17:30] everything that's happened in our life
[1:17:32] is not good but it's for our good
[1:17:36] for good to them that love God to them
[1:17:40] who are the called according to his
[1:17:43] purpose I don't know about you but I
[1:17:46] know that I know that I know that I'm
[1:17:48] one of the called according to his
[1:17:50] purpose
[1:17:51] for whom he did for no
[1:17:54] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:17:58] to the image of his son
[1:18:01] that he might be the firstborn among
[1:18:04] many brethren
[1:18:06] moreover
[1:18:08] whom he did predestinate
[1:18:11] them he also called whom he called them
[1:18:15] he also Justified and whom he justified
[1:18:20] them he also glorified so we've got
[1:18:25] foreknowledge
[1:18:27] predestination calling justification and
[1:18:31] at the end glorified or glorification
[1:18:36] what shall we then say to these things
[1:18:39] if God before us
[1:18:42] all these things that happened to us
[1:18:45] nobody looks forward to heartache or
[1:18:48] trial or difficulty or disappointment
[1:18:50] but here we can know that if God before
[1:18:54] us
[1:18:56] if God before us come on
[1:18:59] who can be against us I want to ask you
[1:19:03] before you're seated how many of you
[1:19:04] know God is for you
[1:19:06] you gotta know it you've got to know
[1:19:09] that God bless you as you're seated
[1:19:10] you've got to know it
[1:19:14] is for you
[1:19:18] he's not out to destroy you he's out to
[1:19:22] conform you to the image of his son
[1:19:26] and sometimes it takes pressure like we
[1:19:28] were singing about just a moment ago to
[1:19:31] mold us into the image of his son now
[1:19:35] God knows just how hard your head is
[1:19:41] and I've been told that I got a hard one
[1:19:46] my wife is not here she will be after a
[1:19:49] while
[1:19:50] but but just ask her
[1:19:52] this pastor have a hard head she'll say
[1:19:55] he does
[1:19:56] God knows exactly what it takes
[1:20:00] to mold me into his image
[1:20:03] it'd be nice if it could all be candy
[1:20:05] and all be sweetness and all be
[1:20:07] wonderful blessings in our life
[1:20:10] but his sister Anita Curry wrote the
[1:20:13] song It's a mixture
[1:20:16] of suffering and blessing
[1:20:19] so that when we come out of life we come
[1:20:22] out smelling just like him
[1:20:25] conformed to the image of his son it's
[1:20:27] not easy to thank God for the hardship
[1:20:31] but like sister Flo said up here before
[1:20:33] her surgery she told us she reminded us
[1:20:37] of the story of the ten Boom family if
[1:20:40] you've ever been to to the Netherlands
[1:20:42] you have probably like me you have
[1:20:44] probably been to the ten Boom house
[1:20:47] where this family of Dutch people lived
[1:20:51] and the hiding place where they hid the
[1:20:54] Jewish people during the Holocaust
[1:20:57] they finally came and arrested the dad
[1:21:00] and the and the sisters the whole family
[1:21:04] and sent them to the concentration camps
[1:21:08] Bessie and Corey I met Corey ten Boom
[1:21:13] myself with my grandmother in in South
[1:21:16] Carolina and I feel so blessed to have
[1:21:19] been able to shake her hand
[1:21:22] Bessie and Corey were sent to Robbins
[1:21:25] Brook
[1:21:26] and it was a horrible place it was one
[1:21:29] of the places during the Holocaust where
[1:21:32] they ran the medical experiments
[1:21:35] on the Jewish people and those who had
[1:21:38] aided the Jewish people they implanted
[1:21:41] different things in their body to see
[1:21:44] how it would affect them
[1:21:46] and they were treated so cruelly
[1:21:49] and their sister Flo mentioned to you
[1:21:51] there was a terrible pandemic of of lice
[1:21:55] in that hole in that whole concentration
[1:21:59] camp I think maybe they might have
[1:22:02] originally started out in Auschwitz and
[1:22:04] I've been there many years later of
[1:22:07] course but I think she ended up in
[1:22:09] Robbins Brook
[1:22:11] and while they were there this great
[1:22:13] outbreak of lice and and Corey and
[1:22:16] Bessie in fact most women in those days
[1:22:18] had long hair
[1:22:20] and one of the things they did to to to
[1:22:23] stop this pandemic of Lies was to shave
[1:22:27] their heads
[1:22:29] and uh when I was in those concentration
[1:22:32] camps some years ago the hair had been
[1:22:35] saved and preserved
[1:22:37] and I stood and looked in a glass window
[1:22:40] about half the size of this church wall
[1:22:43] at mounds and mounds of hair every bit
[1:22:46] of it had turned gray even though when
[1:22:49] it was shaved off of the Jewish people's
[1:22:52] heads it was of all colors
[1:22:55] Through The Years detached from life it
[1:22:58] had all turned gray and it's just
[1:23:00] sitting there in Mounds
[1:23:03] and they knew that that's what was about
[1:23:05] to happen to them
[1:23:07] before they started handling it that way
[1:23:10] they were having Bible studies in the in
[1:23:13] the huge dorms that they had there where
[1:23:18] three or four women were sleeping in one
[1:23:21] twin bed
[1:23:23] and the conditions were horrible not
[1:23:26] enough food
[1:23:27] to to even deal with the hunger pains
[1:23:31] they were scratching so hard and so
[1:23:34] aggravated by the by those lice
[1:23:39] and Corey was complaining just a little
[1:23:41] bit she was murmuring just a little bit
[1:23:44] who wouldn't
[1:23:47] but her sister Bessie said Corey
[1:23:49] remember what the Bible said
[1:23:52] it didn't say for all things give thanks
[1:23:57] how many of you know what the scripture
[1:23:59] said it says in all things in all things
[1:24:04] give thanks for this is the will of God
[1:24:06] in Christ Jesus concerning you
[1:24:10] she said Corey we can't complain about
[1:24:13] that she said it's awful awful hard to
[1:24:15] get through it but we can't complain
[1:24:17] because she said look what God has done
[1:24:20] we're one of the only dorms that has the
[1:24:23] freedom to to teach the Bible and to
[1:24:26] pray with these ladies because the
[1:24:28] guards refuse to come in here because of
[1:24:31] the lies
[1:24:33] and she said we ought to be thankful
[1:24:35] this morning that God's given us the
[1:24:37] opportunity to read the few pages of the
[1:24:40] Bible that were smuggled in and passed
[1:24:43] around until they were tattered and torn
[1:24:46] and she said we ought to be so thankful
[1:24:48] that we have this opportunity and and
[1:24:51] and Corey wasn't sure that she could
[1:24:53] give God thanks for the lies and and
[1:24:55] that's when Bessie told her didn't say
[1:24:57] thank God for the lice
[1:24:59] he said thank God in the lies in all
[1:25:03] things give thanks for this is the will
[1:25:06] of God there's enough suffering in this
[1:25:09] room if you knew the lives if you really
[1:25:13] heard the testimonies of the few
[1:25:16] handfuls of people that are gathered
[1:25:18] here this morning you you would look at
[1:25:21] your life if you if you added all that
[1:25:23] up you'd look at your life and say I've
[1:25:24] had a pretty good life
[1:25:26] because there's so many people in this
[1:25:28] room who have been so through so many
[1:25:30] horrible things and it's amazing to me
[1:25:33] that it causes some people to question
[1:25:35] if there is a God
[1:25:38] it causes some people to say if there's
[1:25:41] a God he must not be good
[1:25:44] and then there's a Believer who says God
[1:25:47] is good in all things he is good in the
[1:25:52] good times he is good in the bad times
[1:25:55] he is good come on they've learned the
[1:25:59] victory of giving God praise in every
[1:26:03] circumstance because they understand
[1:26:05] that God has tailor made a life
[1:26:09] he has built a life out of his Destiny
[1:26:12] book for you and I to bring us to where
[1:26:16] we are in this hour I want to tell you
[1:26:19] this morning that the the greatest days
[1:26:22] for the Bride of Jesus Christ are not
[1:26:24] behind us
[1:26:26] they're just ahead of us
[1:26:30] pardon me they're just ahead of us
[1:26:34] and so we've got to press with
[1:26:37] everything that's in US knowing that he
[1:26:40] who foreknew us
[1:26:42] he who predestinated us he who called us
[1:26:46] he who is already Justified us is the
[1:26:49] one who's glorifying us in this hour if
[1:26:52] you believe that I want you to say Amen
[1:26:55] now we have made it through
[1:26:59] already
[1:27:00] four of those steps
[1:27:03] in God's Redemptive plan
[1:27:09] we've studied foreknowledge
[1:27:12] we have studied what it means to be
[1:27:14] given a pre-fixed destiny predestination
[1:27:20] we've talked about what it means to be
[1:27:22] called
[1:27:24] you see your God's foreknowledge of you
[1:27:27] and his predestination of you took place
[1:27:30] outside of time
[1:27:32] it took place in eternity before the
[1:27:36] foundation of the world
[1:27:38] and then when you were expressed into
[1:27:40] the Earth
[1:27:42] some point in your life the third part
[1:27:45] god called you
[1:27:47] he dealt with you about your life he
[1:27:51] lets you see yourself in the mirror and
[1:27:53] you saw your need for a savior
[1:27:56] and you called on his name and he was
[1:27:58] there how many of you that's your
[1:28:00] testimony he called to you
[1:28:03] some were on a bar stool
[1:28:06] some were in a crack house
[1:28:09] I'm in it in this room
[1:28:11] some were playing the Harlot
[1:28:14] when that voice called to them and said
[1:28:17] I wanna I wanna find you I want to save
[1:28:19] you I want to deliver you that took
[1:28:22] place in the realm of time
[1:28:24] justification took place as you begin to
[1:28:27] surrender your life to him repent
[1:28:30] and be baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:28:34] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:28:36] you did that because there was a wooing
[1:28:39] there was a calling there was a drawing
[1:28:42] of the Holy Spirit it made it very
[1:28:44] personal to you even the Bible can feel
[1:28:47] very cold if God doesn't call you to it
[1:28:51] if the Holy Spirit doesn't woo you to it
[1:28:54] and begin to reveal its truth to you
[1:28:57] once he begins to draw you to that word
[1:29:01] you can fall in love with that word and
[1:29:04] nothing will ever satisfy you like the
[1:29:06] word of God does
[1:29:08] there's a lot of things I enjoy in life
[1:29:10] but I there's nothing I enjoy more than
[1:29:13] being under the influence of that
[1:29:15] precious word of God and in the
[1:29:19] beginning the word was with God and the
[1:29:22] Word was God and the word became flesh
[1:29:26] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[1:29:30] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[1:29:33] of the father full of grace and truth
[1:29:35] how many of you are glad that the word
[1:29:37] was fleshed out it became a living
[1:29:40] reality in the earth and that word
[1:29:42] called you and wooed you some of you
[1:29:45] came through the Baptist and some of you
[1:29:47] came through the Lutheran some of you
[1:29:49] even came through the Catholic some of
[1:29:52] you came through the Pentecostals but
[1:29:54] you're just walking on and on and on as
[1:29:57] that light begins to draw you in a into
[1:29:59] a closer relationship with Jesus Christ
[1:30:02] and once you begin to surrender your
[1:30:04] life he justifies you
[1:30:06] and when he justifies you brother random
[1:30:09] said that's not forgiveness that's more
[1:30:12] than forgiveness that is though you
[1:30:14] never sinned in the first place now I
[1:30:17] want to tell you that's a powerful truth
[1:30:19] right there if God can so reverse your
[1:30:22] sin that there is no record that it was
[1:30:24] ever committed and he can look at you
[1:30:27] and never again see what you were before
[1:30:30] his blood touched your life
[1:30:32] oh I Want To Praise Him
[1:30:35] that makes me want to surrender my life
[1:30:38] to him but then it comes down to this
[1:30:40] last stage that fifth step of the Plan
[1:30:44] of Redemption where the Apostle said and
[1:30:47] to whom he he justifies he also
[1:30:51] glorifies
[1:30:53] let me give you the definition of that
[1:30:55] word to be glorified or being glorified
[1:30:59] it means to be magnified
[1:31:03] it means to signalize with a
[1:31:06] manifestation of dignity
[1:31:14] everybody turn to Jesse
[1:31:18] Jesse happy birthday this week
[1:31:21] we love you
[1:31:23] did you know it was your birthday
[1:31:26] you know now
[1:31:27] how old you're going to be
[1:31:29] 20 years old
[1:31:31] I like I've said before I have socks in
[1:31:34] my drawer right now that are over 20
[1:31:36] years old
[1:31:38] I may have a moon
[1:31:41] so don't feel old yet you got a long way
[1:31:44] to go
[1:31:45] we love you Jesse we do
[1:31:47] it means to to raise something up
[1:31:52] to give honor to
[1:31:54] to extol how many of you are familiar
[1:31:57] with that word it's a word that means to
[1:31:59] praise
[1:32:00] to extol to lift up
[1:32:04] it means to to give or to impart a
[1:32:08] greatness
[1:32:10] a splendid greatness did you know that's
[1:32:13] the end of The Plan of Redemption for
[1:32:15] your life is that God wants to raise you
[1:32:18] up and give you a splendid greatness
[1:32:23] now there's nothing greater than being
[1:32:25] called to manifest Jesus Christ
[1:32:28] it's the invisible Union that we're
[1:32:30] talking about it's becoming one with the
[1:32:33] word that we're talking about and that's
[1:32:35] when we're raised up it means to be
[1:32:38] clothed with splendor
[1:32:40] if we know what foreknowledge means
[1:32:42] predestination calling justification now
[1:32:46] you can know what it means when the
[1:32:47] Bible said and you'll be glorified it
[1:32:49] means you'll be clothed in splendor
[1:32:53] it means that you will have a foretaste
[1:32:56] of the glory to come in eternity
[1:33:00] so that means that even while you're
[1:33:03] living here on planet Earth you can
[1:33:05] carry a measure of the glory in eternity
[1:33:10] the Bible said that we would be
[1:33:13] privileged to taste to partake of the
[1:33:17] glory of the things to come
[1:33:20] that means that while we are still
[1:33:23] living in this difficult life we get to
[1:33:26] taste the powers of the age to come now
[1:33:30] I don't know about you but that's what I
[1:33:31] want to snack on I want to snack on the
[1:33:34] powers of the age to come and when you
[1:33:38] eat of that which is to come you get
[1:33:41] over your feeling sorry for yourself
[1:33:44] you get over yourself you know loathing
[1:33:47] and you begin to understand I must not
[1:33:50] be so bad after all because he loved me
[1:33:53] enough to foreknow me
[1:33:56] predestinate me call me justify me and
[1:34:00] then let me eat the powers of the age to
[1:34:03] come
[1:34:05] when a man is filled with a genuine
[1:34:08] I'm about to get happy now
[1:34:10] when a man is filled with a genuine
[1:34:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost he has tasted
[1:34:16] eternity
[1:34:17] and therefore
[1:34:19] eternity is walking in his shoe leather
[1:34:22] and so when I feel old when I look at my
[1:34:26] hands sometimes and I wonder how they
[1:34:28] got to looking like that I have to
[1:34:31] remind myself that this is only the
[1:34:34] house that I'm living in that's aging
[1:34:37] inside of me there is a touch of
[1:34:40] Eternity that can never grow old it can
[1:34:43] never die it can never pass away and one
[1:34:47] of these days that which is temporal
[1:34:50] will give way to that which is eternal
[1:34:53] and I will receive a body change
[1:34:57] made like his resurrected body if
[1:35:00] anybody believes that you ought to say
[1:35:02] Amen
[1:35:05] glory to God
[1:35:07] it also means I found this definition
[1:35:10] this morning
[1:35:12] I thought I had them all
[1:35:14] it means to influence one's opinion
[1:35:18] about another
[1:35:21] to glorify
[1:35:23] God wants to lift you
[1:35:26] to a place where others can see who you
[1:35:29] really are
[1:35:31] come on
[1:35:33] you know when they begin to see who you
[1:35:35] really are don't you be surprised if
[1:35:38] somebody doesn't start wanting some of
[1:35:39] that
[1:35:40] come on now
[1:35:43] I went out to the
[1:35:45] to the ball field yesterday
[1:35:47] to watch a couple games softball games
[1:35:49] at my boys were playing
[1:35:52] and you know it it never ceases to amaze
[1:35:55] me how God allows people to be drawn to
[1:35:58] us
[1:36:00] before I got there Benjamin sent me a
[1:36:02] note and he said Dad we've been
[1:36:05] witnessing to this young man
[1:36:07] he wants the Holy Ghost
[1:36:09] I said what
[1:36:11] he wants the Holy Ghost
[1:36:14] and he wants to come to church next
[1:36:16] weekend and be prayed for to receive the
[1:36:20] Holy Ghost and I'm thinking what what
[1:36:23] causes situations like that to even
[1:36:26] unfold and take place and here come a
[1:36:30] young man I said you tell him he better
[1:36:31] come up here and say hello to me and he
[1:36:34] he walks up he's one I got onto one time
[1:36:36] for talking ugly I mean I got him good
[1:36:39] and he's never forgot it and he came
[1:36:43] walking up and he was so proud to tell
[1:36:45] me he said we're going to have a baby
[1:36:48] preacher we're going to have a baby and
[1:36:50] he just stood there talking and
[1:36:52] lingering around us and I enjoy it so
[1:36:54] much because I recognize that on
[1:36:58] occasion our Eternal uh part that part
[1:37:02] that is not of this world that eternal
[1:37:05] life that you and I carry by the new
[1:37:07] birth it squeezes out through the cracks
[1:37:10] sometimes
[1:37:12] and people begin to see that there is
[1:37:15] something that is not religion there is
[1:37:18] something that is reality how many of
[1:37:21] you want to be so filled with eternity
[1:37:23] that everywhere you go
[1:37:25] eternity just loses out of the pores of
[1:37:28] your skin and somebody says I want what
[1:37:31] you've got
[1:37:34] that's why our sisters dress differently
[1:37:37] than than the average it's where our
[1:37:40] brothers are called to live a higher
[1:37:42] life than those around us not because we
[1:37:45] think we're better than anybody else not
[1:37:48] because we think we have to do different
[1:37:50] to earn salvation
[1:37:52] we're doing it as an offering
[1:37:55] we live this life as an offering unto
[1:37:58] God who has been so good to us I'm
[1:38:02] telling you the goodness of God keeps
[1:38:04] chasing you and I down can anybody say
[1:38:07] Amen he's after you he wants to bless
[1:38:12] you he wants to fill you with who he is
[1:38:15] he wants to so fill you
[1:38:18] that those around you in line at the
[1:38:22] restaurant
[1:38:23] if you're brave enough to go to Walmart
[1:38:29] wherever you go
[1:38:31] God wants to let that light shine out of
[1:38:33] you in such a way that's part of the
[1:38:36] glorification that that caps off our
[1:38:39] Redemption
[1:38:40] to be glorified to influence one's
[1:38:43] opinion about another so as to enhance
[1:38:46] that individual's reputation
[1:38:49] you don't do that by bragging on
[1:38:51] yourself
[1:38:52] it's on what we're talking about here is
[1:38:54] something higher than what you can
[1:38:55] accomplish out of your own ambition this
[1:38:58] is God filling you so full of who he is
[1:39:01] that you can hardly help yourself
[1:39:03] it just comes out of your mouth it comes
[1:39:06] out of your language your vocabulary is
[1:39:08] influenced by eternity and the way you
[1:39:11] live the way you the way you choose the
[1:39:13] choose your to pay your bills the way
[1:39:16] you conduct your business
[1:39:18] testifies if there's a living God who
[1:39:21] lives inside of you is there anybody
[1:39:23] here who believes that
[1:39:25] being glorified as a fifth part of the
[1:39:29] plan five steps of redemption that
[1:39:33] doesn't mean going to heaven
[1:39:35] God's not talking to us in this
[1:39:37] scripture in Romans the Apostle Paul is
[1:39:40] not talking about going to heaven he's
[1:39:42] talking about something he wants to do
[1:39:44] for us now
[1:39:46] it's speaking about us receiving a
[1:39:48] revelation of his glory that works in US
[1:39:52] it's Christ in you
[1:39:56] what's the rest of that
[1:39:58] the hope of glory it's that portion of
[1:40:02] his glory it's the hope of his glory
[1:40:05] that's working on the inside of you and
[1:40:08] that's what we're after we're after
[1:40:09] Christ
[1:40:11] that we might win him we're not working
[1:40:13] this life for a for a mansion somewhere
[1:40:16] we're not working this life so that we
[1:40:18] can walk on golden streets and have a
[1:40:21] mansion and and see all the beauty all
[1:40:24] these things are beautiful to think
[1:40:25] about and Heaven is a lovely place but
[1:40:28] you know we're not working for heaven
[1:40:30] we're doing what we do in living what we
[1:40:33] live because we want to be a light and
[1:40:35] we want to be a testimony
[1:40:37] of the hope of Christ that lies within
[1:40:40] us
[1:40:40] the glory is working in US internally to
[1:40:45] position us to a place where we can
[1:40:47] fully step into everything written about
[1:40:49] us
[1:40:51] in the books
[1:40:53] you got to have it all
[1:40:55] there's a part of you that cannot
[1:40:57] surrender to God's full plan that he has
[1:41:00] written about you in the books of Heaven
[1:41:02] until that Glory starts shining in you
[1:41:04] and on you and through you and you start
[1:41:07] experiencing a true change one that is
[1:41:10] not about getting a good blessing in
[1:41:11] church one that is about going outside
[1:41:14] of the Four Walls of this church and
[1:41:16] living a new life I need you to be with
[1:41:18] me this morning we only got a handful or
[1:41:21] two here so we got to pull a little bit
[1:41:22] harder to get this out
[1:41:25] I want you to look at Second Corinthians
[1:41:27] chapter 3 and verse 18. this is one of
[1:41:31] my favorite verses here on this subject
[1:41:35] second Corinthians chapter 3 and verse
[1:41:39] 18 King James first it says but we all
[1:41:45] with open face
[1:41:49] beholding as in a glass
[1:41:52] the glory of the Lord
[1:41:56] are changed
[1:41:58] will you say that with me are changed
[1:42:02] into what
[1:42:11] you are looking into the glory of the
[1:42:14] Lord
[1:42:15] and as you and I look into the glory of
[1:42:19] the Lord there is a change that begins
[1:42:22] to take place it's the it's part of that
[1:42:24] Redemptive plan we're being conformed
[1:42:27] to the image of his son and the more we
[1:42:30] look upon him and the more we look upon
[1:42:34] his glory the more we're changed
[1:42:37] and the next thing you know we're we we
[1:42:39] look in the mirror and we see that we
[1:42:42] have been transformed to be just like
[1:42:45] him
[1:42:46] we're not wearing a robe and maybe long
[1:42:49] hair on our shoulder and walking about
[1:42:52] healing all the sick although the bride
[1:42:55] has a Ministry there's no doubt about
[1:42:57] that we're not trying to go back to the
[1:43:00] second century and and live like that go
[1:43:03] around barefooted and so forth this is
[1:43:06] not what's happening but what's
[1:43:07] happening is Christ is updating himself
[1:43:10] in a little bride in this hour and he's
[1:43:14] changing her from glory to glory it's
[1:43:18] part of the Redemptive work and the
[1:43:21] Apostle said even as by the spirit of
[1:43:25] the Lord how are we changed from glory
[1:43:28] to glory by looking upon him
[1:43:32] now most of us when we when we look in
[1:43:35] the natural mirror we see ourselves
[1:43:39] and I want you to know if you look at
[1:43:41] the mirror of God's word and you see
[1:43:44] yourself you're going to see every flaw
[1:43:47] you're going to see every shark coming
[1:43:50] you're going to see every wart and every
[1:43:53] blemish and every wrinkle but I want you
[1:43:56] to know the Christian doesn't look at
[1:43:58] the mirror of the word that way we're
[1:44:00] not looking to see how unlike him we are
[1:44:03] we're not looking to see every blemish
[1:44:06] and every Scar and every failure we're
[1:44:09] looking to see him and the more we look
[1:44:12] into the mirror and see Christ
[1:44:14] spiritually looking back at us and we
[1:44:17] refuse to turn our gaze to the things of
[1:44:21] the world no matter how ugly it gets
[1:44:24] around us we refuse to follow the
[1:44:27] depressive ways of the world around us
[1:44:29] and we just keep putting our face back
[1:44:31] toward him and we continue to see him
[1:44:34] and we choose it's a choice
[1:44:37] Even in our sorrow we can choose to see
[1:44:40] the Lord
[1:44:42] Even in our difficulty we can choose to
[1:44:46] see the Lord
[1:44:47] when things are shaking up around us
[1:44:50] the job is Shifting and we're not sure
[1:44:54] and there's unrest in our family and
[1:44:57] sickness in our loved ones and so many
[1:45:01] loss
[1:45:03] we say goodbye to those we love
[1:45:06] this can be a very very uncertain time
[1:45:09] to live in this hour but we choose I'm
[1:45:12] preaching to somebody
[1:45:14] I'm preaching to somebody if you'll hear
[1:45:16] me we choose to look to the Lord you
[1:45:20] must make that choice consciously and
[1:45:23] consistently I choose to see the Lord I
[1:45:27] choose to look upon his glory I choose
[1:45:30] to look upon his goodness I choose to
[1:45:33] praise him for what he's already done
[1:45:34] knowing that he's not losing me he's
[1:45:37] holding on to me and he's going to pull
[1:45:40] me through
[1:45:42] he has an intention to finish what he
[1:45:45] started you believe him do you trust him
[1:45:48] do you trust that he can finish what he
[1:45:50] started
[1:45:52] how about giving me that in the
[1:45:53] Amplified
[1:45:57] which is a lot
[1:45:59] I want you to follow this one
[1:46:01] and all of us
[1:46:03] as with unveiled face
[1:46:06] because we continued to behold in the
[1:46:10] word of God
[1:46:11] as in a mirror the glory of the Lord
[1:46:14] this is what I just said
[1:46:16] you're not looking into the word to see
[1:46:20] how rotten your flesh is
[1:46:22] come on folks look this way
[1:46:26] you're not looking in the word to see
[1:46:28] how rotten your flesh is can I settle it
[1:46:31] for you
[1:46:31] it's rotten
[1:46:34] I don't have to look in the word to see
[1:46:36] how rotten my flesh is
[1:46:38] my flesh is rotten
[1:46:41] my soul is in a struggle because of mind
[1:46:45] will and emotions so I don't have to
[1:46:48] look in the word of God to see how how
[1:46:50] far I I fall short
[1:46:53] I choose as the Apostle said here to
[1:46:56] continue to see the word of God in the
[1:46:59] mirror to choose to continue to see the
[1:47:03] glory of the Lord which means I choose
[1:47:06] to look upon the Lord
[1:47:08] and to do it with an unveiled face so
[1:47:12] that there's nothing between me look
[1:47:14] this way
[1:47:15] there's nothing between me and him
[1:47:18] I'm just looking at his goodness
[1:47:21] I'm looking at his faithfulness
[1:47:24] I'm reminding myself that he's never
[1:47:27] lost the case
[1:47:30] that even when I'm confused he never is
[1:47:34] even when I don't know what the next
[1:47:36] step is he already knows the path
[1:47:38] he doesn't just know my day-to-day he
[1:47:41] knows my future
[1:47:42] he sees my eternity
[1:47:45] and he's wooing me and drawing me
[1:47:48] the Apostle Paul said here in the
[1:47:50] Amplified as in a mirror we continue to
[1:47:52] behold is in a mirror the glory of the
[1:47:54] Lord we are constantly I love it we are
[1:47:58] constantly being
[1:48:01] transfigured this is the glorification
[1:48:03] process
[1:48:05] this is The Shining this is what's going
[1:48:07] to shine out of your life one of these
[1:48:10] days
[1:48:11] you know Paul and Silas even in their
[1:48:14] bloody condition
[1:48:16] beaten and maimed and scarred and marred
[1:48:19] for the testimony of Christ they chose
[1:48:22] in the Midnight Hour not to moan and
[1:48:24] groan
[1:48:25] who who makes that choice with me
[1:48:28] I choose not to moan and groan I choose
[1:48:31] to sing a song
[1:48:36] I'm Walking the Floor this morning at
[1:48:38] three o'clock and I was feeling the
[1:48:40] intensity
[1:48:41] of what Ashley was going through and I
[1:48:44] prayed until there were no more English
[1:48:46] words and I prayed until there were no
[1:48:48] more Holy Ghost words no more tongues
[1:48:51] coming and I almost got back into bed
[1:48:53] and laid down then and take a nap
[1:48:55] because you pray till there's nothing
[1:48:56] else to pray and all of a sudden a song
[1:48:59] started coming
[1:49:02] so guess what I just started singing
[1:49:05] walking around the bed just singing the
[1:49:07] goodness of the Lord
[1:49:10] I love your voice
[1:49:16] I love your voice for your mercy never
[1:49:21] fails me all my days I've been held in
[1:49:28] your hands from the moment that I wake
[1:49:32] up till I lay my head I will sing of the
[1:49:40] goodness of God all my life
[1:49:46] you have been faithful you won't be
[1:49:49] pretty but we're gonna get it out
[1:49:52] [Music]
[1:49:53] then so
[1:49:59] with every breath
[1:50:03] able
[1:50:05] oh I will sing of the goodness of God I
[1:50:13] love your voice you have led me through
[1:50:17] the fire
[1:50:19] and in darkest nights you are close like
[1:50:25] no other
[1:50:26] I've known you as a father
[1:50:31] I've known you as a friend and I have
[1:50:36] lived in the goodness of God
[1:50:42] all my life
[1:50:47] [Music]
[1:50:48] all my life
[1:50:53] stronger
[1:50:56] with every breath that I am
[1:51:02] oh I will sing of the goodness
[1:51:07] of God hallelujah
[1:51:11] give him praise
[1:51:16] for your goodness is running after me
[1:51:20] [Applause]
[1:51:24] it wasn't necessary for you to stand
[1:51:27] but some of you did
[1:51:30] and when you did I looked back there and
[1:51:32] I saw Michael
[1:51:33] and crystalline sitting behind sister
[1:51:35] Weston Paul
[1:51:37] and I thought no wonder they're on their
[1:51:39] feet
[1:51:45] they're told you no this happens
[1:51:47] sometime that one twin absorbs the other
[1:51:50] twin
[1:51:52] so you know you need to be aware of that
[1:51:55] and one is smaller than the other
[1:51:58] all these things run through your mind
[1:52:01] and all the things they tell you
[1:52:03] and the things you read
[1:52:06] and even sometime crystalline the things
[1:52:08] church people will tell you trying to
[1:52:10] help you
[1:52:12] and all that just rolls over on you and
[1:52:15] weighs you down and then you are forced
[1:52:18] to make a decision I'm going to trust in
[1:52:21] the goodness of God
[1:52:26] and then they say we're going to take
[1:52:27] the babies on certain day we're going to
[1:52:29] take no no we got to take them sooner
[1:52:31] than that and we've got to take them
[1:52:33] sooner than that we got to do this we
[1:52:35] got to do that they're doing all they
[1:52:36] know to do God bless the doctors and
[1:52:38] nurses and caretakers but they don't
[1:52:41] know it all
[1:52:43] anybody here
[1:52:45] they don't know it all
[1:52:47] and she goes up to that hospital it's
[1:52:50] early her blood pressure goes up and it
[1:52:52] looks like things are going haywire in
[1:52:55] the body the body's in some kind of
[1:52:57] shock they don't know what all is going
[1:53:00] on but she goes right in there her
[1:53:03] mother and others have told me she's
[1:53:05] cracking jokes with the nurses
[1:53:09] if you can get in a laugh you might as
[1:53:12] well
[1:53:14] there's not enough money in life
[1:53:17] come on life can get serious in a hurry
[1:53:21] I'm sure she wasn't just laughing the
[1:53:23] whole time
[1:53:24] come on but any chance she could get a
[1:53:27] little smile out of somebody she was
[1:53:29] doing that and God allowed her to birth
[1:53:32] those children naturally
[1:53:34] [Music]
[1:53:37] they didn't have to be taking C-section
[1:53:40] and they were early and and so there's a
[1:53:42] little inconvenience
[1:53:44] and a little little you know uncertainty
[1:53:47] a lot of things going on and here
[1:53:49] Michael and crystalline who desire to be
[1:53:52] with their babies but but also desired
[1:53:55] to be in God's house this morning if for
[1:53:58] no other reason to raise their hands and
[1:54:01] say I have lived in the goodness of God
[1:54:04] come on Look What the Lord Has Done
[1:54:09] they're gaining weight and it's not
[1:54:12] going to be too much longer that they're
[1:54:14] going to be just absolutely fine
[1:54:18] God is good
[1:54:20] you've got to choose to see him
[1:54:23] you've got to choose a song
[1:54:26] when you want to be in agony sometime
[1:54:28] when you want sympathy sometime when you
[1:54:31] want somebody to feel bad with you
[1:54:33] sometime you have to choose a song
[1:54:36] because every bit of this is a part of
[1:54:39] your glorification
[1:54:42] he did a good job for knowing you
[1:54:45] he did a good job predestinating you
[1:54:48] calling you justifying you and he's
[1:54:51] doing a good job glorifying his bride
[1:54:56] and her with his light
[1:55:00] are you still here
[1:55:02] oh
[1:55:04] put my
[1:55:06] verse back up

[1:55:11] we continued to behold in the word of

[1:55:20] his very own image

[1:55:26] increasing splendor
[1:55:31] are you reading ahead

[1:55:44] from glory to glory he's changing me

[1:56:17] an image to reap me light of God shown
[1:56:23] to the love of God again from Glory

[1:56:32] changing me
[1:56:34] changing me
[1:56:37] this an image to perfect in me the love
[1:56:42] of God shown to the world for his

[1:57:39] perfect in me the love of God shown to
[1:57:44] the world
[1:57:46] of Hallelujah
[1:57:48] [Applause]
[1:57:50] Hallelujah
[1:57:53] Hallelujah
[1:57:56] in ever increasing splendor
[1:57:59] and from one degree of Glory to another
[1:58:04] 318 second Corinthians
[1:58:07] from one degree of Glory to another for
[1:58:12] this comes from the Lord who is the
[1:58:16] spirit
[1:58:17] we're not always patient
[1:58:22] but he's working on us
[1:58:25] from glory to glory from one degree of
[1:58:28] Glory to another
[1:58:30] and when we step into that place of
[1:58:32] glory and that's where I tell you the
[1:58:34] bride better be there
[1:58:36] in 2023 we better be finding ourself in
[1:58:40] that position of Glory that place of
[1:58:43] Revelation and when we get there we
[1:58:45] begin to live the dream that God had
[1:58:47] about us
[1:58:48] before the beginning
[1:58:50] in Colossians 1 27 it says to whom God
[1:58:53] would make known what is the riches of
[1:58:57] the glory of this mystery among the
[1:58:59] Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope
[1:59:03] of glory this is the place where
[1:59:06] everything we've gone through good or
[1:59:08] bad works together to propel us into our
[1:59:14] ultimate Destiny we can call this stage
[1:59:18] of redemption this glorification stage
[1:59:22] we can call it a point of convergence
[1:59:26] because everything that God was doing
[1:59:28] for us up to this point it starts
[1:59:31] weaving together in a place of
[1:59:34] convergence to propel us how many of you
[1:59:39] know what that means to push us forward
[1:59:41] into completing his Destiny plan for our
[1:59:45] life that's what I was telling him Lord
[1:59:48] everything I've been through up till now
[1:59:50] I'm ready for you to propel me I'm ready
[1:59:54] for you to push me into finishing this
[1:59:57] job that you have sent me here to do we
[2:00:00] see this in the life of Joseph when he
[2:00:03] was in his father's house but then sold
[2:00:06] into slavery by jealous Brothers he
[2:00:09] ended up ruling over the house of
[2:00:11] potiphar because he was cast into prison
[2:00:14] unjustly after which he was promoted
[2:00:17] from this most unlikely place to the
[2:00:20] prime minister of Egypt he went from the
[2:00:23] prison to the prime minister
[2:00:26] he became the preserver of life that God
[2:00:30] had destined him to be as it was written
[2:00:32] in the books of Heaven all these things
[2:00:35] work together and converged together
[2:00:37] think of this to prepare and to get
[2:00:41] Joseph to his appointed Place God knows
[2:00:44] how to squeeze you to the right place
[2:00:46] you wasn't born in Alabama he knows how
[2:00:49] to get you to Alabama
[2:00:51] if that's part of his destiny for you if
[2:00:55] that's part of your plan he knows how to
[2:00:57] get you here
[2:00:58] so you quit making fun of the way we
[2:01:01] talk
[2:01:02] now
[2:01:04] [Music]
[2:01:07] and don't make fun of our Red Dirt
[2:01:11] none of us think it's pretty
[2:01:15] but we've learned that if we find good
[2:01:19] in where we're planted
[2:01:22] I'm going to tell you this you've
[2:01:23] already heard it
[2:01:25] but many years ago
[2:01:27] a precious sister that we were blessed
[2:01:31] to meet
[2:01:32] prophetically years ago
[2:01:35] had a call from God
[2:01:37] the Calvary Pentecostal Church in
[2:01:40] in Richmond Virginia
[2:01:43] they had a call from God to send young
[2:01:46] people to Jerusalem to pray
[2:01:49] and 53 young people packed their
[2:01:53] suitcases and went to Israel for for
[2:01:56] some of them for several years some of
[2:01:59] them for several months
[2:02:01] and their their commission from the Lord
[2:02:03] was to find themselves on Mount Zion
[2:02:07] daily
[2:02:08] and pray
[2:02:10] you know that's a commission
[2:02:12] it's one that most of us would struggle
[2:02:14] with
[2:02:15] it was quite a sacrifice there weren't
[2:02:19] very few Full Gospel meetings going on
[2:02:21] in Jerusalem those many years ago in the
[2:02:24] 70s early 70s
[2:02:26] very few Spirit-filled meetings going on
[2:02:29] in Israel during that time
[2:02:32] but here they go a bunch of them single
[2:02:34] women a bunch of uh young single women
[2:02:38] in their 20s some in their 30s never
[2:02:40] never married but there were also young
[2:02:43] brothers and and a few couple married
[2:02:45] couples that went and every day they
[2:02:47] found themselves
[2:02:49] standing out in Mount Zion praying and
[2:02:51] singing to the Lord and one day the
[2:02:54] fathers the the priest at the church of
[2:02:58] Saint Peter of galakantu they came and
[2:03:01] said would you all like to use
[2:03:03] our church for these prayer gatherings
[2:03:06] and it shocked them that they were being
[2:03:09] invited into the Catholic Church to use
[2:03:12] the the room there to begin to pray they
[2:03:15] said well we we speak in tongues and
[2:03:18] they said that don't matter
[2:03:19] and they said well we dance as part of
[2:03:22] our worship that don't matter
[2:03:24] they said well we prophesy as part of
[2:03:27] our worship they said that don't matter
[2:03:28] we just want you to come inside we don't
[2:03:31] want to see out here when it's raining
[2:03:34] and so they begin and those meetings
[2:03:36] begin to grow and God began to do great
[2:03:38] things
[2:03:39] and years later I got to come in and
[2:03:43] reap some of the benefit in Jerusalem
[2:03:46] that those young people had blazed a
[2:03:48] trail many many years ago I got to come
[2:03:51] in and preach Jesus name baptism they
[2:03:54] were a trinitarian group but I got to
[2:03:56] come in and preach the Oneness of God in
[2:03:58] Jesus name baptism and I got to baptize
[2:04:01] people that they had won to the Lord I
[2:04:03] got to baptize them in the name of Jesus
[2:04:05] Christ come on now God is good
[2:04:08] he let me reap where I had not sown
[2:04:12] but some of the young people didn't last
[2:04:14] very long
[2:04:16] because they began to find everything
[2:04:18] wrong with Jerusalem
[2:04:20] and I want to tell you something I've
[2:04:21] lived there long enough
[2:04:23] and for enough periods of time
[2:04:26] 10 and a half weeks
[2:04:28] at one stent
[2:04:31] and more than one time I went for five
[2:04:34] weeks came home for two weeks and went
[2:04:37] back for another five weeks
[2:04:39] I wouldn't say that I you know that was
[2:04:42] my residence but it's I certainly felt
[2:04:44] connected to the city
[2:04:46] and I saw the bad you can get a parking
[2:04:49] ticket
[2:04:50] at the drop of a hat
[2:04:53] there doesn't have to be a sign
[2:04:56] there doesn't even have to be a law
[2:04:59] there just has to be a car
[2:05:02] I'm telling you the truth it's it's it's
[2:05:04] a joke anybody who's ever driven in
[2:05:07] Jerusalem knows that in fact most
[2:05:09] everybody carries cash to pay the
[2:05:11] tickets
[2:05:12] because they know and no need to argue
[2:05:15] the one thing you need to know you do
[2:05:17] not argue with the Jewish person
[2:05:19] you're going to lose
[2:05:22] you don't argue you just pay the ticket
[2:05:24] and some of the young people got very
[2:05:26] upset by that and it's dusty
[2:05:29] it's dusty there's a hum scene that
[2:05:32] blows in from the desert and sometimes
[2:05:34] the air is orange
[2:05:36] and sometimes in the early Spring's rain
[2:05:40] the early uh rains began to fall I was I
[2:05:43] was at a reception with the mayor of
[2:05:45] Jerusalem
[2:05:47] and some years ago felt very honored to
[2:05:50] be there
[2:05:51] and as I'm walking through the city
[2:05:53] Stacy was expecting
[2:05:55] uh Olivia at the time I think
[2:05:59] and they had to find a place to park
[2:06:02] close enough to get to where the
[2:06:03] reception so I said just let me out and
[2:06:05] I'll walk
[2:06:07] big mistake
[2:06:09] because I had on a spotless brand new
[2:06:11] crisp white shirt
[2:06:13] and I'm walking toward the reception
[2:06:15] with a tie on to meet the mayor and the
[2:06:18] spring rain begins
[2:06:21] and it didn't it didn't fall on me like
[2:06:23] water that wouldn't have been problem
[2:06:25] when that water filtered through that
[2:06:27] red air
[2:06:29] that desert dirt
[2:06:31] it dropped her I looked like an
[2:06:33] alabamian
[2:06:34] I had red spots all over my shirt and
[2:06:38] when it was my turn to talk to the mayor
[2:06:40] I apologized to him and he said oh no
[2:06:43] there's no need to apologize you stand
[2:06:47] before me wearing Jerusalem
[2:06:53] but some of those young people that went
[2:06:55] originally they got discouraged and they
[2:06:57] began to complain
[2:06:59] and they began to say oh that parking
[2:07:02] tickets and ah the weather in I don't
[2:07:05] like the food and
[2:07:10] Like Jesse
[2:07:16] he settled his Destiny last Sunday
[2:07:20] he definitely has to go to Jerusalem
[2:07:22] with us
[2:07:23] because he was complaining we went to a
[2:07:26] Greek Mediterranean restaurant and he
[2:07:28] was he said this most awful wasn't it
[2:07:29] you
[2:07:31] um
[2:07:32] this is your birthday whoopings right
[2:07:34] here
[2:07:37] he said this most awful food I've ever
[2:07:38] had in my life
[2:07:40] and I'm thinking this is the best food
[2:07:42] I've had in years
[2:07:44] this is delicious wonderful glorious
[2:07:47] food and he complain that's how some of
[2:07:49] those young people were doing and they
[2:07:50] got together in a prayer meeting and and
[2:07:52] sister Ruth was very discouraged about
[2:07:54] it she said I don't I can't make them
[2:07:56] lord I can't make them love the city I
[2:07:59] can't make them love it like I love it
[2:08:01] but she said Lord you give me such a
[2:08:03] love for Jerusalem that it's not that
[2:08:05] I'm ignorant to all the bad
[2:08:07] but I choose not to see the bad I choose
[2:08:10] to see the good and I choose to stand in
[2:08:13] her Gates like you told me to and sing
[2:08:15] your praises and the word of the Lord
[2:08:18] came through someone else in that
[2:08:19] service that prayer meeting that morning
[2:08:21] and the word of the Lord was this don't
[2:08:23] complain
[2:08:25] don't spend your time murmuring and
[2:08:28] complaining about the assignment that I
[2:08:30] have given to you only speak the good
[2:08:34] only speak the good about Jerusalem and
[2:08:38] I will give you an inheritance in this
[2:08:40] land
[2:08:41] now I tell you that would make you want
[2:08:43] to change your attitude come on
[2:08:46] so there are times that we are faced to
[2:08:49] choose not to see the bad
[2:08:53] we're not living in denial
[2:08:55] we see it's there but we choose not to
[2:08:59] focus on that
[2:09:01] because we recognize that as Joseph was
[2:09:04] squeezed into a moment of Destiny
[2:09:10] we are also being squeezed
[2:09:15] into a convergence point in our life and
[2:09:18] it can be costly
[2:09:20] it can be costly
[2:09:22] let me give you another verse and we'll
[2:09:23] move on I won't hold you too long now
[2:09:26] Romans chapter 8.
[2:09:28] verse 17 and 18. and if children
[2:09:32] then heirs
[2:09:34] this is who I am I'm an heir of God
[2:09:37] I'm join Ayers with Christ if so be that
[2:09:40] we suffer with him that we may be also
[2:09:45] is coming
[2:09:47] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[2:09:49] present time are not worthy to be
[2:09:51] compared with the glory which shall be
[2:09:53] what
[2:09:55] not to us
[2:10:00] if it said revealed to us it would
[2:10:03] probably be speaking about after death
[2:10:06] it didn't say the glory that will be
[2:10:09] revealed to us it said it's not worthy
[2:10:11] to be compared with the glory which
[2:10:14] shall be revealed
[2:10:18] will you just do this one one second
[2:10:20] some of you just make me happy
[2:10:23] in me
[2:10:25] the glory that is being revealed don't
[2:10:27] say will be one day is be is being
[2:10:29] revealed it is it's being revealed in me
[2:10:33] it's the promise it's the promise if I
[2:10:35] go through some tough stuff and I and I
[2:10:38] keep praising God and pushing through
[2:10:40] his glory can be revealed in my life
[2:10:43] that word glorified there means the
[2:10:47] condition of being bright
[2:10:50] thank you
[2:10:51] or Shining
[2:10:53] radiance
[2:10:55] a reflected Radiance that cannot be
[2:10:59] diminished
[2:11:01] God wants to fill us with a reflective
[2:11:05] Radiance that cannot be replenished
[2:11:10] we're not there yet
[2:11:12] but we're making our way if you believe
[2:11:15] that same man in the message proving his
[2:11:18] word give me 10 minutes
[2:11:20] in the message proving his word
[2:11:25] now remember
[2:11:27] that was not Jesus talking to Abraham
[2:11:30] there
[2:11:31] that could discern the thoughts in
[2:11:33] Sarah's mind behind him that was not
[2:11:35] Jesus he had not yet been born but it
[2:11:38] was a man in human flesh that Abraham
[2:11:42] called Elohim
[2:11:44] the great Almighty
[2:11:46] so you need to understand that was God
[2:11:49] in the body of a man
[2:11:52] it was it was definitely in morphe it
[2:11:56] was God in the body of a man but brother
[2:11:59] Branham is careful for us not to say
[2:12:01] that is Jesus because his name had not
[2:12:04] yet been given
[2:12:06] remember the Bible said there is a name
[2:12:08] above every name there's a name given
[2:12:11] and the name had not yet been given so
[2:12:14] we can't say this was Jesus that was
[2:12:15] talking uh to them in the tent Abraham
[2:12:18] and Sarah but this was God
[2:12:21] revealing himself
[2:12:23] in a body and Jesus said as it was in
[2:12:26] the days of Sodom now watch close in the
[2:12:29] days of Sodom so will it be at the
[2:12:31] coming of the son of man when the son of
[2:12:33] man is being revealed not no more as a
[2:12:36] church see
[2:12:37] the bride is called see
[2:12:42] in that day the son of man will be
[2:12:46] revealed what
[2:12:48] to joined the church
[2:12:52] to the Head
[2:12:54] who's the head that's Jesus Christ to
[2:12:58] join the church not a prophet
[2:13:00] not a pastor
[2:13:04] not a Swami
[2:13:06] come on
[2:13:09] what what's the
[2:13:12] what's the guy that uh
[2:13:15] that's so revered that had to make an
[2:13:17] apology recently what's his name what do
[2:13:19] they call him
[2:13:21] say it again
[2:13:23] Dalai Lama
[2:13:25] um
[2:13:26] not the Dalai Lama
[2:13:32] to join the church to the Head
[2:13:36] Unite
[2:13:38] the marriage
[2:13:40] of the Bride
[2:13:42] bride to bridegroom isn't it let's go on
[2:13:46] the bridegroom call will come right
[2:13:49] through this
[2:13:50] when the son of man will come down and
[2:13:53] come in human flesh to unite the two
[2:13:56] together
[2:13:58] the church has to be the word I need to
[2:14:04] say that again that's not programs
[2:14:07] that's not Bible clubs
[2:14:10] that's not recovery classes all that may
[2:14:14] be fine needed in fact
[2:14:17] but the church has to be the word
[2:14:21] he is the word and the two
[2:14:24] guess what they unite together
[2:14:28] and to do that it'll take the
[2:14:31] manifestation of the revealing of the
[2:14:35] son of man
[2:14:37] and we understand that God has done that
[2:14:39] not a clergyman he goes on to say
[2:14:42] you see what I mean see it's
[2:14:44] son of man Jesus Christ coming down in
[2:14:48] human flesh Among Us
[2:14:51] and will make his word so real that
[2:14:55] it'll unite the church and him as one
[2:14:59] the bride
[2:15:01] and then she'll go home to the wedding
[2:15:04] supper now talk about being glorified
[2:15:07] that's a powerful glorification isn't it
[2:15:09] she's already United so we go to the
[2:15:13] wedding supper not to the marriage
[2:15:15] of all we feel your flesh all the Flesh
[2:15:18] of Mighty Men he's talking about the
[2:15:20] verse in Revelation because the marriage
[2:15:23] of the Lamb has come but the Rapture is
[2:15:26] going to the wedding supper so remember
[2:15:28] when we leave here one of these days
[2:15:30] we're heading to the marriage supper
[2:15:33] she's already United
[2:15:35] see we go to the marriage to the wedding
[2:15:37] supper not to the marriage he said when
[2:15:40] the word here unites with the person and
[2:15:44] they too become one and then what does
[2:15:47] it do then it manifests the son of man
[2:15:51] again not the church theologians the son
[2:15:55] of man the word and the church become
[2:15:58] one whatever the son of man does he was
[2:16:02] the word I'll let you read the rest
[2:16:10] somebody said I don't know what my
[2:16:12] destiny is I don't know what all of it
[2:16:13] is but I know what part of it is it's to
[2:16:16] do the same thing
[2:16:18] just like it is spoken here now let me
[2:16:21] give you one more
[2:16:23] this is in the message questions and
[2:16:25] answers number two
[2:16:28] I have actually have two more and I'm
[2:16:30] going to give them and be done
[2:16:33] what are you what you are here
[2:16:37] get this in your mind now I'm going to
[2:16:41] close
[2:16:42] but what you are here
[2:16:45] is a sign that you are something else
[2:16:49] somewhere now let me help you with the
[2:16:53] language here
[2:16:54] because brother Branham often said
[2:16:56] things like this
[2:16:58] because you are an attribute of another
[2:17:01] dimension of another world
[2:17:04] quite often you are living out here a
[2:17:07] reflection of what you were there in his
[2:17:11] mind
[2:17:12] you've always wanted to be in Perfection
[2:17:15] you Christians there is a Perfection and
[2:17:20] that Perfection is not in this life
[2:17:23] let's go on
[2:17:27] but every man and woman here that is a
[2:17:30] Christian every person that is a
[2:17:33] Christian here now is already glorified
[2:17:37] there
[2:17:40] you see that's not what he said that's
[2:17:42] what he's pointing to
[2:17:44] every person that is a Christian here
[2:17:47] now is already glorified in the presence
[2:17:51] of Jesus Christ think of it
[2:17:54] and you've got another body whoo
[2:17:57] did you know it's not it's not that it
[2:17:59] has to be made for you it's already made
[2:18:01] for you
[2:18:02] did you know your next body is already
[2:18:05] created formed and ready and waiting on
[2:18:07] you
[2:18:08] did you know sometime when the presence
[2:18:10] of the Lord comes real in the house that
[2:18:13] body draws near
[2:18:17] oh yes he said that I didn't just pull
[2:18:19] that out of my ear
[2:18:20] he taught us that
[2:18:22] it draws near from that other from that
[2:18:25] other dimension it draws near and he's
[2:18:27] preaching away he said have you heard
[2:18:29] from your theophany
[2:18:31] because sometimes that next body gets
[2:18:35] pretty motivated and excited about the
[2:18:38] fact that you're you're going to live in
[2:18:39] that
[2:18:41] it's a reflection of who you are now but
[2:18:44] it's totally totally totally a body with
[2:18:48] no pain and no heartache and no sorrow
[2:18:51] and no rheumatism and no headaches and
[2:18:54] no handicaps but every man and woman
[2:18:56] here that is a Christian every person
[2:18:58] that is a Christian here now is already
[2:19:00] glorified in the presence of Jesus
[2:19:02] Christ and you've got another body
[2:19:06] you've got another body let's read on
[2:19:09] you won't have some other time you have
[2:19:11] right now right now there's another body
[2:19:15] waiting for you if this one should
[2:19:18] perish could you think of that
[2:19:21] study that just a minute
[2:19:24] so I want you to know something
[2:19:26] you don't have to worry about making
[2:19:29] your transition
[2:19:30] when that day comes that you're going to
[2:19:33] make a transition when we sing the song
[2:19:36] Swing Low
[2:19:39] Sweet Chariot we're not singing about a
[2:19:43] a vehicle with wheels
[2:19:48] that's not what's going to swing down
[2:19:49] and get you're not Elijah
[2:19:52] if you're waiting on horses of fire to
[2:19:55] pull you to Eternity that's not what the
[2:19:57] prophet taught us
[2:19:58] it's not the the chariot wheels and the
[2:20:01] horses of fire that's going to carry on
[2:20:03] you really could sing swing low might
[2:20:06] theophany
[2:20:10] Coming For To Carry Me Home
[2:20:14] because in that moment that this body
[2:20:16] should perish
[2:20:18] you have another body that swings right
[2:20:21] down out of that other dimension
[2:20:24] to pick up the real you
[2:20:26] and to take you into eternity
[2:20:29] oh let me tell you something death isn't
[2:20:32] real
[2:20:34] what in the already talking about death
[2:20:36] isn't real it's a bluff
[2:20:39] it's just a doorway
[2:20:41] you're just stepping into another
[2:20:44] dimension into another realm into
[2:20:47] another body
[2:20:50] the prophet taught us that our loved
[2:20:52] ones are not very far away from us you
[2:20:56] know I know that I want to know do you
[2:20:58] know that our loved ones are not very
[2:21:01] far from us even in this moment and
[2:21:03] sometimes they draw in because like the
[2:21:06] Angels they like to look on what God's
[2:21:09] doing in your life think about that
[2:21:11] they're cheering you on as a part of
[2:21:13] that great cloud of witnesses that no
[2:21:16] matter what comes in your life they're
[2:21:18] cheering you on don't give up
[2:21:21] don't give up
[2:21:23] keep pressing
[2:21:26] now my last one before we close
[2:21:30] it's from the Easter seal
[2:21:32] I like to call it the resurrection seal
[2:21:37] paragraph 105 I hope you can handle this
[2:21:40] and I'm done
[2:21:42] and God bless all you streamers I'm not
[2:21:44] giving up on I'm just closing the lid
[2:21:48] to remind myself to hush
[2:21:52] okay just a minute
[2:21:55] see here
[2:21:57] okay there's not any movement
[2:22:08] don't let me forget what I'm reading
[2:22:18] you won't mind if I take a minute
[2:22:32] God is good
[2:22:35] um
[2:22:42] Jesus
[2:22:49] let me just see if I can get an answer
[2:22:51] back
[2:22:53] thank you Father
[2:22:55] let's pray just a minute and uh right
[2:22:57] now they're not getting any movement and
[2:23:00] uh
[2:23:01] the thing is when you're when you're in
[2:23:03] the hospital then they don't go too
[2:23:07] that you go too long and they want to do
[2:23:09] a C-section so
[2:23:11] I'm just asking if they'll try the
[2:23:14] the mild suction first
[2:23:18] let's see if we can get an answer but
[2:23:19] until then let's pray just a minute
[2:23:21] father in the name of Jesus we have
[2:23:24] given this to you we have given Ashley
[2:23:26] to you we've given David to you Lord and
[2:23:29] we've given this beautiful little baby
[2:23:31] girl to you we thank you for the angels
[2:23:34] of the Lord that are with them in that
[2:23:36] room right now we thank you Lord that
[2:23:39] that like all of us in this room that
[2:23:42] precious little baby girl has a destiny
[2:23:45] book and every year and day of her life
[2:23:49] are already recorded in that book and
[2:23:51] before she was ever formed in her
[2:23:54] mother's belly you already knew her and
[2:23:56] you knew the circumstances of her birth
[2:24:00] and you knew the beginning of her life
[2:24:02] and you you knew the end of her life and
[2:24:04] you knew the in-between
[2:24:07] so we trust you today Lord we trust that
[2:24:11] you have a plan but Lord it is certainly
[2:24:14] certainly their desire and our desire
[2:24:17] that it would be the way they would want
[2:24:19] it to be so Lord if at all possible we
[2:24:22] would ask that you would allow her to
[2:24:26] give birth to that child even as she has
[2:24:28] desired but Lord we commit this into
[2:24:31] your hands
[2:24:33] we committed into your hands would you
[2:24:35] touch her now not only physically but
[2:24:37] emotionally
[2:24:39] spiritually would you whisper to her
[2:24:42] right now and bring peace to Ashley in
[2:24:45] the name of Jesus
[2:25:02] [Music]
[2:25:16] yes Lord yes Lord yes Lord
[2:25:20] yes Jesus
[2:25:22] yes Jesus there's nothing here to
[2:25:26] indicate that it's an emergency just
[2:25:28] the doctor's recommendation for the fact
[2:25:31] that there's no movement they're not
[2:25:32] able to to push her any closer to
[2:25:36] to life
[2:25:38] oh Jesus oh Jesus thank you
[2:25:42] I'll watch that
[2:25:44] and let me read this quotation to you
[2:25:47] McLeod musicians well that won't take
[2:25:49] long
[2:25:51] you you
[2:25:53] come
[2:26:00] hallelujah praise God
[2:26:03] praise God
[2:26:04] praise God
[2:26:07] Hallelujah
[2:26:09] Lord you told us it was done
[2:26:11] so we we believe it we believe your word
[2:26:15] oh they tried they tried to
[2:26:18] suction
[2:26:23] this is not a church this is a family so
[2:26:26] we just take care of our own right now
[2:26:33] she's ready to get it over with does
[2:26:34] anybody blame her
[2:26:42] now I got several texting at one time
[2:26:51] thank you oh
[2:27:03] sorry
[2:27:11] I know you deal with what I deal with
[2:27:13] some of you my age anyway words pop up
[2:27:16] there that you don't mean to put there
[2:27:20] I mean it you'll start topping something
[2:27:22] and it throws another word up there and
[2:27:25] sometimes it's not appropriate for the
[2:27:27] situation
[2:27:31] and you people that send me them voice
[2:27:33] text
[2:27:37] I've asked two or three folks don't send
[2:27:40] me any more of them without you edit
[2:27:41] them
[2:27:45] no emergency the baby's good that's a
[2:27:48] blessing
[2:27:49] all is good with the baby because I
[2:27:52] don't always have the gift of
[2:27:53] interpretation it comes and goes
[2:27:55] and so sometimes I can't interpret what
[2:27:58] people are saying I might fire into
[2:28:00] somebody and be and be answering
[2:28:02] something rebuking something that they
[2:28:03] didn't even say
[2:28:08] you say what you want to about this
[2:28:10] you'll never find another group like
[2:28:12] this
[2:28:13] we are unique
[2:28:15] 105 put it up there for me now but when
[2:28:19] they went up to Pentecost there they
[2:28:22] received the quickening power the power
[2:28:25] that made them alive
[2:28:27] and you need that quickening power it's
[2:28:30] part of the process of glorification
[2:28:33] now he said now there's where I think
[2:28:35] that you Presbyterian and Methodist
[2:28:37] Brethren you you do receive potentially
[2:28:39] On Believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:28:41] but the abstract hasn't come yet that's
[2:28:45] the clearing of the deed oh thank God
[2:28:47] God gave Abraham a promise Abraham
[2:28:50] believed God and it was imputed unto him
[2:28:53] for righteousness but he sealed the
[2:28:56] Covenant by the Seal of circumcision and
[2:29:00] God gives you a promise potentially that
[2:29:02] you will receive it and you're going to
[2:29:04] be raised up this body is going to be
[2:29:07] glorified with him at the end of time
[2:29:09] but you see you have to get a clearance
[2:29:11] on that deed
[2:29:14] and the clearance is when everything
[2:29:17] against it every claim against it has
[2:29:21] been stricken off and you've got the
[2:29:23] abstract to it you've got the seal it's
[2:29:26] yours everything is on it it belongs to
[2:29:30] you amen how many of you have the faith
[2:29:32] to believe that and when we believe on
[2:29:35] Jesus Christ for our savior and repent
[2:29:38] and are baptized and come up to believe
[2:29:40] him God recognizes our repentance and
[2:29:44] our faith towards him and sins down the
[2:29:48] abstract
[2:29:50] the abstract is the Assurance it's the
[2:29:54] guarantee that everything was ever held
[2:29:57] against you if you thoroughly repented
[2:30:00] Hallelujah and the property is bought
[2:30:02] and you hold the abstract for the
[2:30:06] Assurance let somebody try to put you
[2:30:09] off the land say say he belongs you with
[2:30:13] the abstract in your hand let him try to
[2:30:15] do it there ain't a law and the land can
[2:30:17] do that because you hold the abstract
[2:30:21] how many of you understand the analogy
[2:30:24] that's being you there's no devil no
[2:30:26] church nor any theology that can
[2:30:29] overstep the boundaries of God's proof
[2:30:31] and Abstract that the baptism of the
[2:30:34] Holy Ghost has recognized Us in Jesus
[2:30:38] Christ we're just as sure to raise as he
[2:30:42] raised because potentially we have read
[2:30:46] it
[2:30:49] you believe it
[2:30:51] two paragraphs here to finish this one
[2:30:53] the old things what does it do to our
[2:30:56] mortal bodies
[2:30:58] it turns our opinion changes our Notions
[2:31:01] it sets our affections on things above
[2:31:04] on things which are above smoking
[2:31:08] drinking gambling the things that you
[2:31:10] used to do dead
[2:31:11] it's beneath you and you were quickened
[2:31:15] and this quickening power brings your
[2:31:17] body into a raptured condition already
[2:31:19] already
[2:31:23] that's part of the Pentecostal blessing
[2:31:25] notice the Pentecostal people up there
[2:31:28] when they got quickened by the Holy
[2:31:29] Spirit
[2:31:31] listen to me when those Pentecostal
[2:31:34] group up there on the day of Pentecost
[2:31:36] receive their abstract Deed from God
[2:31:39] sure it glorified their souls
[2:31:44] mind will and emotions
[2:31:47] they screamed
[2:31:49] they saw tongues of fire separated upon
[2:31:52] each of them and it so quickened their
[2:31:54] body redacts too it's there till they
[2:31:57] couldn't even speak in an Earthly
[2:31:58] language anymore
[2:32:01] interesting isn't it
[2:32:03] it quickened their body
[2:32:07] help me
[2:32:09] it quickened their body to a Heavenly
[2:32:11] language the place they're going to
[2:32:16] they started speaking Heaven's language
[2:32:20] while here on the Earth
[2:32:22] quickening power
[2:32:26] the quickening power of God shook their
[2:32:28] mortal body so till their entire mortal
[2:32:31] language was transfigured transformed
[2:32:34] into an immortal language what a
[2:32:36] quickening power what something that
[2:32:39] belongs
[2:32:41] I want you to know that's what the Holy
[2:32:43] Ghost comes to start in your life
[2:32:46] that quickening power starts that
[2:32:49] process of Glory that eternity rising up
[2:32:53] in you to change your mind and your will
[2:32:56] and your emotions and one of these days
[2:32:58] he sweeps down
[2:33:01] and changes this body if you believe
[2:33:04] that say Amen
[2:33:06] glory be to God let's stand
[2:33:15] come and let's Worship the Lord

[2:48:39] thank you Jesus
[2:48:42] you can be seated just a moment
[2:48:50] [Music]
[2:48:54] now we're going to close and
[2:48:57] we're going to go home some of us that
[2:48:59] live close and get our food
[2:49:02] I don't know how many times this week we
[2:49:04] considered canceling and postponing
[2:49:07] because so many would be gone and then
[2:49:09] babies coming and
[2:49:10] but I'm hungry
[2:49:14] I gotta eat somewhere
[2:49:16] and I hadn't slept so I might as well
[2:49:18] eat
[2:49:19] and but we'll have to go home and get it
[2:49:21] and bring it back so give us a few
[2:49:24] minutes
[2:49:26] we ask the Lord to do it with the
[2:49:28] weather like he wanted to do and he's
[2:49:30] drying up the rain we thank him for that
[2:49:33] they're going to do a C-section
[2:49:35] but at the end of that there's going to
[2:49:37] be a healthy baby
[2:49:39] that's what we believe
[2:49:41] God saw it it's in his hands we didn't
[2:49:44] see it for sure but he did
[2:49:46] and uh
[2:49:48] you know I know this is a plain talk we
[2:49:51] I can talk real playing with you about
[2:49:53] it but
[2:49:55] um
[2:49:56] there was a time that if a woman had a
[2:49:58] C-section that was it
[2:50:00] she had to have that every time but
[2:50:02] we're not living in that day no more
[2:50:05] or not thank God we're not
[2:50:08] as some of you know
[2:50:10] and it just it's disappointing to
[2:50:13] someone who has a plan and
[2:50:16] and has had the faith
[2:50:19] but God knows he knows
[2:50:23] so do what you can to love on them and
[2:50:25] by the time we come back and
[2:50:27] and eat I mean from afar right now would
[2:50:30] you love on them from afar
[2:50:35] but by the time we come back for lunch
[2:50:37] and we'll probably have an announcement
[2:50:39] a birth announcement I've been kind of
[2:50:42] you know how you get
[2:50:44] I mean 55 is not old by the way
[2:50:48] foreign
[2:50:50] that was sad
[2:50:54] is it
[2:51:02] is it sister West no

[2:51:14] you were strong
[2:51:17] [Applause]
[2:51:19] and Young
[2:51:21] but when you I mean it
[2:51:24] somebody said 40 40 was nothing I
[2:51:27] laughed at 40. 50 paused me a moment
[2:51:32] and my wife saw it so she planned this
[2:51:35] huge party
[2:51:36] because she said we got to get we gotta
[2:51:38] cheer him up and all of a sudden right
[2:51:41] at the last minute 55 I went oh my
[2:51:45] that's when I started oh God give me 30
[2:51:47] more healthy years to serve you
[2:51:51] so since I've been in that frame of mind
[2:51:53] I'm going to send you home with a song
[2:51:55] that I love very much
[2:52:01] and pastoring at 16.
[2:52:04] so I was an interim pastor at 15. so

[2:52:14] this September will be 48 years of
[2:52:17] ministry and I've been pastoring here
[2:52:20] in in August or September of this year
[2:52:24] 33 years that's a long time
[2:52:28] but I don't
[2:52:33] regret a mine
[2:52:37] that I've traveled
[2:52:41] for the Lord
[2:52:44] and I don't
[2:52:48] regret the time
[2:52:52] I trusted
[2:52:54] [Music]
[2:52:56] his word
[2:53:00] I've seen the years
[2:53:04] go by
[2:53:08] many days days
[2:53:11] without a song
[2:53:14] but I don't
[2:53:18] regret grandma
[2:53:23] I've traveled for
[2:53:27] the Lord
[2:53:30] 67 countries
[2:53:33] I don't regret a mind
[2:53:38] I've traveled
[2:53:41] for the Lord
[2:53:45] sing with me and I know
[2:53:48] regret
[2:53:50] time
[2:53:54] time that I have trusted in
[2:53:58] his word
[2:54:01] I have seen
[2:54:04] [Music]
[2:54:05] go by
[2:54:08] there have been many days
[2:54:11] without
[2:54:13] a song
[2:54:15] but I don't regret
[2:54:21] it
[2:54:22] [Music]
[2:54:24] I have traveled
[2:54:27] four the Lord listen
[2:54:32] I've dreamed many a dream
[2:54:35] that never came true
[2:54:38] and I've seen many of them
[2:54:41] vanish it Dawn
[2:54:43] but I've realized enough of my dreams
[2:54:47] thank God to make me want to keep
[2:54:51] dreaming on
[2:54:53] I've gotten up out of the bed many times
[2:54:56] at The Midnight Hour
[2:54:58] to pray a prayer that it seemed no
[2:55:01] answer would come
[2:55:03] though I'd waited patient and long
[2:55:06] but answers have come to enough of my
[2:55:09] prayers
[2:55:11] to make me want to keep
[2:55:13] praying on
[2:55:15] I've trusted many a friend
[2:55:18] that's failed me
[2:55:19] and left me to weep alone
[2:55:23] but I've found enough of those true blue
[2:55:26] friends
[2:55:27] to make me want to keep
[2:55:29] trusting on it seems that I've sowed
[2:55:33] many a seed
[2:55:35] that's Fallen by the way
[2:55:38] for the birds to feed upon
[2:55:41] but I've held enough golden sheaves of
[2:55:43] grain in my hand
[2:55:45] to make me keep
[2:55:47] sowing on
[2:55:50] seems that I've drained the cup of
[2:55:52] disappointment and pain
[2:55:54] and I've gone many a day without a song
[2:55:58] but I've sipped enough nectar
[2:56:00] from the Roses of life
[2:56:03] that makes me want to keep living on I
[2:56:07] don't regret
[2:56:10] my
[2:56:13] mom I've traveled sing it with me
[2:56:16] for the Lord
