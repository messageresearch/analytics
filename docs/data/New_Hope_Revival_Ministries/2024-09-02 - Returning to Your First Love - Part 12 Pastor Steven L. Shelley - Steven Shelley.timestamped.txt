[48:56] [Applause]
[49:00] he's so
[49:04] worthy you may be seated just a moment
[49:07] he's
[49:09] worthy I saw yesterday that Paul had
[49:14] posted a picture with his mom and I said
[49:17] to my wife I said do you reckon sister
[49:19] West is uh Paul is up there with sister
[49:21] West I didn't know it was the other way
[49:24] around we're sure glad to see you this
[49:26] morning so glad what a
[49:33] surprise she's like some of the other
[49:35] seniors here who can testify something
[49:38] keeps holding them and we know what it
[49:41] is it's the hand of the Lord Kade that
[49:45] was a superb song for those of you that
[49:48] don't know that was fresh from Heaven it
[49:50] only came two days ago and he put that
[49:53] together in time for this morning let's
[49:54] thank God for that gift
[50:02] anyone who has ever known the religious
[50:04] struggle knows what it feels like to try
[50:07] to walk on
[50:10] water that's what we try to do sometime
[50:13] and I think even the prophet told us
[50:15] that God wasn't looking for that he
[50:18] wasn't looking for people who walk on
[50:20] water doesn't mean it wouldn't be great
[50:22] if we needed to walk on water that'd be
[50:24] all right but I think sometimes we think
[50:27] we have to be something that we're just
[50:29] we're just not and we just need him it's
[50:33] not about religious performance it's
[50:35] about daily surrendering in sincerity
[50:39] and honesty and and in truth walking
[50:42] before God in integrity and he does the
[50:44] rest he does the rest I'm thankful for
[50:47] the blood today aren't you we're blessed
[50:51] I want you to know that camp meeting is
[50:53] coming up and uh I was hoping to to have
[50:56] some really good news for you this
[50:59] morning about the about the uh the air
[51:04] conditioning but it didn't didn't come
[51:06] together just like we thought yet but we
[51:09] believe that it's going to very shortly
[51:12] and we'll have good news about that uh
[51:15] we're thankful for the one unit for sure
[51:19] uh Brother G is not here to give you a
[51:21] report but he's uh in Virginia and uh
[51:25] just so happened that his dad was going
[51:26] going to be away so he was also able to
[51:28] preach for his dad this morning I've
[51:30] been in touch with him I think he texted
[51:33] me before I know it was before 7 o'clock
[51:36] we were texting each other and um God is
[51:41] good he's just good um but we know for
[51:46] sure that the uh sheetrock has been uh
[51:50] finished hung and finished in the in the
[51:54] bathrooms and uh we're bless less by
[51:57] that there may be some I mean maybe more
[51:59] I don't know
[52:00] exactly what else has to be done but
[52:03] they they were there working a couple
[52:04] days this week and it sure makes a
[52:07] difference when you go in and you can no
[52:08] longer see through the walls I mean it
[52:11] it really looks real then and um we're
[52:16] probably not going to do too much to the
[52:17] leftand wall because we're we're not
[52:20] expecting to keep it very long it's just
[52:23] uh the sheetrock will help insulate it
[52:26] and and we're hoping to to eventually
[52:28] take in another section of the
[52:30] Tabernacle cuz we're going to need it
[52:32] for what's about to come we're we're
[52:35] going to see some things we are seeing
[52:37] some things but there is a squeeze
[52:40] coming
[52:41] on it's coming
[52:43] on and uh depending on the election it
[52:47] may come sooner than what we think so we
[52:50] need to be ready we need to be so full
[52:54] of everything that can be found in
[52:56] Christ
[52:57] that when people come looking for
[53:00] something you've got it you don't have
[53:02] to you don't have to go pray it down but
[53:04] you're already carrying the deposit of
[53:06] strength and Glory that folks are going
[53:08] to need in the trying days that are
[53:11] ahead for our nation God has been good
[53:14] to us and he will continue to take care
[53:16] of his own but it may be some tough
[53:20] times are ahead and it's going to put us
[53:23] together it's going to pull us together
[53:25] that's what the prophet told this is
[53:26] what the scripture tells us we're going
[53:28] to be pressed together squeezed together
[53:32] so we better learn to get along while we
[53:34] still have some Elbow
[53:36] Room because when we get squeezed
[53:39] together we can't get away from each
[53:41] other aren't you glad sometime when you
[53:43] can Retreat to another place from the
[53:46] crowd I am but we may not have that
[53:50] pleasure in days to come I don't ever
[53:53] want you to judge somebody else's praise
[53:57] especially if you don't have
[53:59] any I don't want you to judge anybody
[54:02] else's praise that what they do is
[54:04] between them and the
[54:06] Lord uh Jennifer was enjoying some
[54:10] victory this morning and and uh I
[54:13] couldn't help but see it and and the
[54:17] thought really blessed me because I know
[54:19] that she has had a rough week and so
[54:22] what do you do do you come in with your
[54:24] face dragging down some of some of you
[54:27] do with your face dragging down like you
[54:30] have nothing to live for or do you come
[54:33] in and just make up your
[54:35] mind it's getting a little tight in here
[54:38] already do you just make up your mind
[54:40] I'm going to praise him because he's
[54:43] worthy we better do it that way it
[54:46] brings us to a personal level of Victory
[54:48] so God bless you Sister as long as I
[54:53] have anything to say about it
[54:57] I don't care if it's fast or slow it
[54:59] doesn't matter to me how people worship
[55:00] as long as they're doing it unto the
[55:03] Lord I'm not going to I don't even want
[55:05] to be a part of a place that there can't
[55:08] be some Liberty when Liberty is so
[55:11] needed he whom the son makes free is
[55:14] what free indeed free indeed so uh
[55:19] concerning camp meeting I have some news
[55:22] for you and that is we have invited
[55:24] brother Dwayne Jackson to come and speak
[55:26] for us Brother David Templeton is going
[55:29] to come and speak for us uh brother um
[55:33] rers is going to speak the first night
[55:36] for us from South Africa and uh then
[55:39] brother gy and I will each take a
[55:41] service the Lord willing uh brother
[55:44] Dwayne will probably have two Services
[55:46] Brother David will probably have one but
[55:48] all of it is just really up to the Holy
[55:51] Ghost whatever he wants is what we want
[55:55] and um you know I'm not interested in
[55:59] getting caught up in that top 10
[56:01] preacher thing and feeling like you
[56:04] can't have camp meeting without a
[56:06] certain speaker coming to preach uh we
[56:09] can have camp meeting anytime we make up
[56:11] our mind to come and celebrate the Lord
[56:14] amen but we have been greatly blessed by
[56:18] Brother Jackson's Ministry in the past
[56:21] and Brother David Templeton has become a
[56:23] quick friend and we're very thankful
[56:25] some of you have been to his services
[56:27] and you know that God is using him in
[56:30] the valley just right up the hill there
[56:32] right up the road and we're very
[56:35] thankful for that and for his testimony
[56:38] God has touched his body in a profound
[56:40] way and we are very thankful of that so
[56:44] uh we'll be getting an announcement out
[56:46] uh probably during the week we're just
[56:48] waiting on the final uh okay from the
[56:51] Lord for the theme couple things are in
[56:54] my heart I want to know that we've
[56:56] chosen what he has on his heart and then
[56:59] no no preacher is obligated to preach by
[57:02] the theme you you you know they we want
[57:05] them to be led of the lord we just try
[57:07] to have something to kind of focus on as
[57:10] we come together so October 15th through

[1:02:36] on the drums and we appreciate him and
[1:02:40] and everyone every person that uh helps
[1:02:43] us and uh don't let's not take for
[1:02:46] granted the the pitiful
[1:02:50] overworked uh computer projector Runners
[1:02:54] not just charity but but all of them
[1:02:57] poor Austin he he needs lots of prayer
[1:03:00] and help and strength he gets so he gets
[1:03:03] so nervous he's so afraid I'm going to
[1:03:05] bite his head off or something but it's
[1:03:08] a it's a job
[1:03:10] because you know if if if I did things
[1:03:13] like other people and got a whole got a
[1:03:15] whole series at one time that'd be
[1:03:17] different but I keep adding to it and I
[1:03:20] give them a new document every week and
[1:03:22] then they got to figure out when I call
[1:03:24] for it they got to figure out where goes
[1:03:27] so always be patient with even the song
[1:03:30] pullers uh uh Miss Olivia Ellsworth does
[1:03:35] a great job and and Jennifer's helped us
[1:03:37] so many times and Mariah different ones
[1:03:40] thank you for it the running of the
[1:03:43] sound and the stream and the camera and
[1:03:46] all all that it takes every effort that
[1:03:49] somebody makes blowing the leaves
[1:03:52] picking up the trash cutting the grass
[1:03:54] trimming the Hedge is everything that
[1:03:57] you do just keep in mind you are doing
[1:04:00] it unto the Lord It's your offering to
[1:04:03] him cleaning the church and he will
[1:04:06] bless you he will reward you I I just
[1:04:10] I'm very thankful for every one of you
[1:04:12] this morning would you turn to Hebrews
[1:04:16] chapter
[1:04:19] 13 beginning in verse S and 8 now I want
[1:04:24] you to know from the the onset that I
[1:04:27] have not
[1:04:30] tailored this
[1:04:32] sermon for any situation that you may or
[1:04:36] may not be aware of in the last few
[1:04:41] weeks I'm saying that because when I do
[1:04:45] my outline I gave these definitions of
[1:04:50] of the behaviors that sometimes manifest
[1:04:53] in the presence of a familiar spirit I
[1:04:55] gave them that weeks ago and we're just
[1:04:59] working our way through each
[1:05:02] definition and so I want you to know
[1:05:05] that we're just to this place this is
[1:05:07] the next definition that I gave and it's
[1:05:12] not directed to anybody it's directed to
[1:05:16] everybody that is just the truth it's
[1:05:19] not a particular easy subject for me but
[1:05:22] the reality is if I don't say this no
[1:05:25] one else will I mean it really is a
[1:05:27] truth no one else really will will will
[1:05:30] use these quotes and so I'm going to do
[1:05:32] it this morning because I believe it's
[1:05:34] what I'm supposed to do but pray for me
[1:05:37] it makes me a bit
[1:05:38] uncomfortable Hebrews chap 13 verse 7
[1:05:42] and 8 remember them which have the rule
[1:05:46] over
[1:05:47] you who have spoken unto you the word of
[1:05:51] God whose Faith follow
[1:05:56] considering the end of their
[1:06:01] conversation Jesus Christ the
[1:06:05] same
[1:06:06] yesterday and
[1:06:09] today and
[1:06:11] forever it's always been a
[1:06:14] bit of a mystery to
[1:06:18] me why in the middle of Paul's
[1:06:21] instruction to the new
[1:06:23] Believers the Jewish
[1:06:26] believers who have become aware of
[1:06:30] Messiah he is instructing them to
[1:06:36] honor and to respect those that have
[1:06:39] been called to speak the words of life
[1:06:42] to them and then the next phrase Jesus
[1:06:47] Christ the same yesterday and today and
[1:06:52] forever the reality is the apostle is
[1:06:55] drawing the connection and he is saying
[1:06:59] that Jesus is still talking and still
[1:07:04] moving and still present among his
[1:07:07] people what he
[1:07:10] did he's still
[1:07:13] doing and he may use a different voice
[1:07:16] he may use different vessels but it's
[1:07:19] him and we're thankful that he hasn't
[1:07:22] changed with so many of our folks
[1:07:25] missing this morning it sure was
[1:07:26] wonderful to have uh brother Austin and
[1:07:29] and Hannah holwell and Miss Natalie who
[1:07:34] just had a birthday uh and and uh little
[1:07:37] Eli it was so wonderful to have them
[1:07:39] come in we're thankful I want you to now
[1:07:42] look at Hebrews 13 that was Hebrews 137
[1:07:47] and 8 now I want to look at Hebrews
[1:07:49] 1317 and 18 same
[1:07:53] chapter just dropping down some
[1:07:56] verses obey them that have the rule over
[1:08:00] you and submit yourselves for they watch
[1:08:05] for your souls as they that
[1:08:09] must give account that they may do
[1:08:13] it with joy and not with grief for that
[1:08:19] is
[1:08:21] unprofitable for who for for you is what
[1:08:26] the scripture
[1:08:27] said I pray for us he goes on to say for
[1:08:32] we trust that we have a good conscience
[1:08:36] in all things willing to live
[1:08:41] honestly I want to live
[1:08:44] honestly before the Lord don't you I
[1:08:46] want to live with Integrity before the
[1:08:49] Lord at the end of the day when I lay my
[1:08:52] head on the pillow I don't want to have
[1:08:54] to do any getting
[1:08:56] right why wait till you go to bed to get
[1:08:58] right I want to live to be right and I
[1:09:03] want to repent through the day when I
[1:09:06] realize that I've been wrong and let the
[1:09:08] Lord take care of it he is he is uh
[1:09:13] longsuffering and he has a lot of tender
[1:09:16] patience toward us father we are so
[1:09:20] thankful for your presence among us
[1:09:24] today the wonderful faces of your people
[1:09:27] who have come to worship you in spirit
[1:09:31] and in truth we're not here because we
[1:09:33] don't have troubles or that or we don't
[1:09:36] have distractions or we don't have needs
[1:09:38] we're here with all of that we're here
[1:09:42] because we honor you and we love you and
[1:09:45] we want to worship you and we want to
[1:09:48] show up for you we need you Lord now to
[1:09:52] help us with this word today break it
[1:09:55] down in our hearts and in our Spirits if
[1:09:59] if anything uh in this series has
[1:10:02] stirred a devil today this surely will
[1:10:07] but we are asking you to
[1:10:09] come show your presence so real so
[1:10:13] strong that we are arrested by the truth
[1:10:17] and it's For Your Glory that we keep on
[1:10:20] keeping on in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:23] Christ we pray and the the Saints said
[1:10:27] amen you may be seated Paul said
[1:10:29] remember
[1:10:31] remember the word remember there in
[1:10:36] Greek and I think you have that is to
[1:10:40] keep in
[1:10:42] mind to focus on the dramatic aspect of
[1:10:49] remembrance it means to
[1:10:52] mention it means to exercise memory to
[1:10:57] recollect also to
[1:11:00] rehearse when the Apostle Paul said
[1:11:03] remember them who have rule over you who
[1:11:07] have spoken unto you the word of God
[1:11:11] you're not following a man you're
[1:11:14] following Faith he said who Faith
[1:11:20] follow the example is not in the
[1:11:23] humanity of the man
[1:11:26] it's not in brother branham's Humanity
[1:11:29] that we trust it's not in the humanity
[1:11:32] of our pastor that we trust and these
[1:11:36] verses are not talking about government
[1:11:38] leaders this is not our president this
[1:11:41] is not our boss on the job there are
[1:11:43] other verses of scripture that can apply
[1:11:46] to that but this is speaking
[1:11:48] specifically about those who Feed Us in
[1:11:52] spiritual matters if Paul is telling us
[1:11:55] us to remember them he's saying mention
[1:11:59] them focus on the dramatic aspect of
[1:12:04] Remembrance in the messages that brother
[1:12:07] brandham preached about
[1:12:09] respects he always mentioned to us that
[1:12:14] it's not whether a man is worthy of
[1:12:17] respect or not it's not the individual
[1:12:20] that we honor and respect it's not it's
[1:12:24] the
[1:12:25] office it's the office that that man
[1:12:29] would hold whether he be a pastor or a
[1:12:32] or a teacher or an evangelist or
[1:12:34] whatever his particular role would be we
[1:12:38] have made our way through some of the
[1:12:41] behaviors and expressions of the
[1:12:44] presence of a familiar Spirit the kind
[1:12:47] of demons that run through generational
[1:12:50] lines and through Bloodlines and through
[1:12:54] dnas
[1:12:55] and we have talked about various ways
[1:12:58] that they manifest today we're going to
[1:13:01] look at Authority
[1:13:03] issues if you'll give me that definition
[1:13:07] Authority issues one of the ways let me
[1:13:09] make sure we're all together one of the
[1:13:12] ways that we can detect the presence of
[1:13:18] a familiar Spirit that's never been
[1:13:20] dealt with that has moved through a
[1:13:23] family line is when that Spirit shows up
[1:13:29] consistently to have issues with
[1:13:34] authority now the definition of
[1:13:37] authority issues is consistent conflict
[1:13:42] with I'll let you help me read it
[1:13:45] god-given
[1:13:47] Authority an inability to cope with
[1:13:51] others
[1:13:53] influence over you
[1:13:56] a problem taking
[1:13:59] advice a fear of being a
[1:14:04] follower almost always stemming from
[1:14:09] past painful
[1:14:11] experiences always expressing a lack of
[1:14:14] trust in leadership and often dropping
[1:14:18] subtle hints that reflect negatively on
[1:14:22] a pastor or leader Maybe maybe you know
[1:14:25] someone like that maybe you've been
[1:14:28] someone like that if indeed that is a
[1:14:33] consistent behavior in someone's life
[1:14:36] that you are connected with it could be
[1:14:40] a clear sign that a familiar spirit is
[1:14:44] operating in that family that needs to
[1:14:47] be dealt with I'm going to read the
[1:14:50] definition again I'm going to read it
[1:14:52] slow because I want you to focus on
[1:14:55] whatever part of that might speak to you
[1:14:59] Authority issues con consistent conflict
[1:15:03] with god-given authority an inability to
[1:15:06] cope with others influence over you a
[1:15:09] problem
[1:15:11] taking
[1:15:13] advice a fear of being a follower almost
[1:15:19] always stemming listen from past painful
[1:15:26] experiences when when a person has had a
[1:15:28] bad
[1:15:29] experience with a boyfriend or with a
[1:15:33] husband and it's not completely been
[1:15:36] resolved and healed in the realm of a
[1:15:39] spirit in the realm of the spirit it can
[1:15:43] often be something that is passed on to
[1:15:47] another generation a a
[1:15:50] hatred a
[1:15:52] prejudice against all men
[1:15:56] do you understand if if a woman has had
[1:15:59] a bad
[1:16:01] marriage she's been abused she's been
[1:16:04] mistreated there is a strong possibility
[1:16:08] that she begins to subconsciously look
[1:16:11] at all
[1:16:12] men like the man that abused
[1:16:15] her they call that in Psychology a
[1:16:19] defense mechanism I understand the
[1:16:22] psychology of it don't you I understand
[1:16:25] how someone can come to a place when
[1:16:28] someone you loved and cherished who was
[1:16:31] supposed to protect you
[1:16:35] instead abused you and neglected you and
[1:16:40] cheated on you and betrayed you and let
[1:16:43] you down that may have happened to to a
[1:16:47] a woman more than once it could have
[1:16:50] happened several times in a row it could
[1:16:53] be the life story of a of a female a
[1:16:57] life story it could have started with
[1:17:00] her father it could have moved to a
[1:17:03] stepfather it could have been an uncle
[1:17:06] then a boyfriend then another boyfriend
[1:17:08] then it could have been a husband then
[1:17:10] it might have been another husband then
[1:17:12] it's a boss on a job making unwelcome
[1:17:17] advances and abusing his authority and
[1:17:20] then another job with another boss who
[1:17:23] has the same behavior the next thing you
[1:17:25] know the brain starts trying to protect
[1:17:29] itself from that kind of repeated
[1:17:32] abuse and what forms in our mind in our
[1:17:36] mindset in our Paradigm is a distrust
[1:17:41] for all
[1:17:42] men unfortunately that doesn't always
[1:17:46] stop there it can move from generation
[1:17:50] to generation to
[1:17:52] generation it's things that are spoken
[1:17:55] it's behaviors that uh that are lived
[1:17:59] out in front of a a child who grows up
[1:18:02] not
[1:18:03] trusting even sometimes we parents can
[1:18:07] so warn our children about everybody
[1:18:11] being a
[1:18:12] boogeyman I know we're living in
[1:18:14] different hour I know we have to be
[1:18:17] careful but there are things we can do
[1:18:19] for instance sometimes people will will
[1:18:22] say to their children who are
[1:18:23] misbehaving in the mall they'll say oh
[1:18:26] there's a
[1:18:29] policeman I'm going to tell him he's
[1:18:32] going to take you to
[1:18:33] jail that may seem extremely cute to you
[1:18:38] but that's not cute you see you're
[1:18:40] passing something down to a small child
[1:18:44] that the policeman is there to haul them
[1:18:48] away to punish them for not uh walking
[1:18:52] right in the mall or behaving right in
[1:18:54] the mall do you understand there may
[1:18:56] come a time that that child needs to
[1:19:00] call on the help of a police officer and
[1:19:03] you wouldn't want to be building a
[1:19:05] Prejudice in their mind that that man's
[1:19:08] not out to help you that man's out to
[1:19:10] punish you that man's out to take you to
[1:19:12] jail I am
[1:19:14] convinced that the reason why we have
[1:19:17] defund the police movements in our
[1:19:20] nation is because a previous generation
[1:19:23] and a previous gener generation has
[1:19:25] dealt with those kinds of issues with
[1:19:29] authority now many of those folks have
[1:19:31] been mistreated they have been
[1:19:34] stereotyped they have been singled out
[1:19:37] because of the color of their skin or
[1:19:39] because of their religious
[1:19:42] affiliation and many have been
[1:19:44] mistreated abused beaten even murdered
[1:19:48] by
[1:19:48] Authority I know that it's history it
[1:19:52] can't be denied but we should not be
[1:19:55] guilty of passing on from generation to
[1:19:58] generation a general distrust of all
[1:20:03] authority there are going to be bad cops
[1:20:07] there are going to be bad
[1:20:09] preachers they are going to be sorry
[1:20:12] husbands they're going to be lousy
[1:20:15] boyfriends they're going to be
[1:20:16] boyfriends that are out for one thing
[1:20:19] only they're going to be bosses who will
[1:20:22] make uh sexual comments
[1:20:25] and and inuendos and and what do they
[1:20:28] call that in the in the workforce uh
[1:20:31] sexual harassment that's going to happen
[1:20:35] but what we need to remember is that all
[1:20:37] authority is not bad all police officers
[1:20:41] aren't out to drag you to jail when
[1:20:43] you're not guilty all pastors are not
[1:20:46] out to deceive you and lead you off and
[1:20:49] take all of your money away from you all
[1:20:52] husbands all boyfriend it's it's not
[1:20:54] right like to make such a
[1:20:58] generalized not only thought process but
[1:21:00] a statement and then pass it on to our
[1:21:02] children and their children and their
[1:21:06] children we need to make sure that we
[1:21:09] are teaching a balance for the Next
[1:21:11] Generation in all
[1:21:13] things yes there are many many people
[1:21:16] who have abused their Authority both
[1:21:18] god-given and government given but that
[1:21:21] doesn't mean that everybody does that's
[1:21:23] right I just need you to know where we
[1:21:25] are I want you to understand that we
[1:21:28] want to break the cycle not only the
[1:21:31] cycles of jealousy or resentment or Envy
[1:21:34] or bitterness but we want to break the
[1:21:37] cycle of raising children who believe
[1:21:41] that especially girls who believe that
[1:21:44] all men are out to get
[1:21:47] them there are many
[1:21:49] abusers but every man is not an abuser
[1:21:53] right there have been many
[1:21:55] stepdads who have abused their
[1:21:58] stepchildren but that doesn't mean that
[1:22:00] all
[1:22:03] stepdads are out to abuse their
[1:22:06] stepchildren there have been many dads
[1:22:08] that have abused their daughters but
[1:22:10] that doesn't mean that every dad
[1:22:11] struggles with the same issues or
[1:22:14] problems so we can't keep passing that
[1:22:17] kind of you know we could call it
[1:22:19] misinformation but it runs so much
[1:22:21] deeper into our lives that it becomes a
[1:22:25] role of iniquity and that
[1:22:28] iniquity because of a multitude of
[1:22:32] iniquity that has not been dealt with in
[1:22:35] our society and in our families the
[1:22:38] Bible said the love of
[1:22:42] many the love of many because iniquity
[1:22:46] abounds it didn't say because sin
[1:22:49] abounds didn't say because transgression
[1:22:52] abounds I I hope you're listening
[1:22:55] it says because iniquity abounds the
[1:22:58] love of many shall wax cold so if we can
[1:23:03] figure out why it is that we have issues
[1:23:08] with
[1:23:09] authority if we can find out why it is
[1:23:12] that we don't trust
[1:23:14] anybody we know it's because our trust
[1:23:17] has been broken we know it's because
[1:23:19] Authority has failed us it's certainly
[1:23:22] let us down do you believe that Paul was
[1:23:25] aware of those kind of abuses in
[1:23:28] Authority we know he was he was a
[1:23:31] Pharisee of
[1:23:32] Pharisees he saw what happens especially
[1:23:36] in the time of Yeshua he saw what
[1:23:38] happens when religious men abused their
[1:23:42] Authority he was familiar with the ways
[1:23:45] of the Pharisees and yet he said
[1:23:48] remember them which have the rule over
[1:23:52] you have who have spoken unto you the
[1:23:54] word of God whose Faith follow
[1:23:57] considering the end of their
[1:23:59] conversation Jesus Christ the same
[1:24:02] yesterday and
[1:24:04] today and forever in the Amplified verse
[1:24:08] S and 8 reads like this remember your
[1:24:11] leaders and superiors in Authority for
[1:24:15] it was they who brought to you the word
[1:24:16] of God observe attentively and consider
[1:24:21] their manner of living the outcome of
[1:24:24] their well spent lives and do
[1:24:28] what
[1:24:30] imitate their faith King James says
[1:24:32] whose Faith follow that's the only
[1:24:35] translation that takes it follow their
[1:24:39] faith almost all the other translations
[1:24:42] go one step further instead of just
[1:24:44] saying follow they say imitate or
[1:24:47] emulate do what you can to be faithful
[1:24:50] as they were faithful if you get your
[1:24:53] mind on the man or the woman or whoever
[1:24:56] it is in leadership if you get your mind
[1:24:58] on them they'll fail you and you'll
[1:25:01] throw them out with the bath water right
[1:25:04] brother B said that's not what we do if
[1:25:06] they fail we pray for
[1:25:07] them if they let us down we pray for
[1:25:10] them brother banam in dealing with the
[1:25:13] pastor in fact he said if the pastor
[1:25:15] fails you I I if he mistreats you if he
[1:25:19] misses doing something for you that you
[1:25:21] needed him to do you pray for him he he
[1:25:24] said you don't put him out he said for
[1:25:26] instance in this church speaking of his
[1:25:28] own you you can't put the pastor out for
[1:25:31] something like that he said the bylaws
[1:25:34] he teaches that the bylaws of this
[1:25:36] church are only if he gets off the
[1:25:39] word as long as he stays on the word
[1:25:43] then he has a position and you honor the
[1:25:46] position and you pray for him when he
[1:25:49] fails you don't spread
[1:25:52] it you just pray for Ing we need prayer
[1:25:56] ministers need prayer pastors need
[1:25:59] prayer leaders need
[1:26:02] prayer the suicide rate among leaders in
[1:26:05] the church is higher than any service
[1:26:09] position more pastors take their lives
[1:26:12] than police
[1:26:13] officers more pastors take their lives
[1:26:16] than firemen or Rescue Squad workers
[1:26:20] it's it's their it's their inner
[1:26:23] struggle it's their their feeling of not
[1:26:25] being valued or appreciated that drives
[1:26:28] them and then they have struggles like
[1:26:31] every other man every other human being
[1:26:33] has struggles who are they going to talk
[1:26:36] to who are they going to get to pray for
[1:26:38] them who are they going to confess their
[1:26:40] weakness to it's really a system that
[1:26:44] that fails a lot of people who have to
[1:26:48] live on the Arro head and I'm not here I
[1:26:52] I want you to know I don't even even
[1:26:54] want to preach this to be totally honest
[1:26:56] with you because it seems so
[1:27:00] self-serving but since it was part of
[1:27:03] the notes and because I have observed
[1:27:06] I've even mentioned to my wife over the
[1:27:09] past few
[1:27:10] months that there is just a a
[1:27:15] disdain in our society for
[1:27:19] men I I mentioned that to you every
[1:27:22] Father's day since I've been here
[1:27:23] probably
[1:27:24] and we're living in a generation where
[1:27:28] fathers are just all
[1:27:30] considered Bart
[1:27:32] Simpsons just
[1:27:34] doofuses you know all they do is go to
[1:27:36] work and they don't care for their
[1:27:38] children and they don't take care of
[1:27:40] business they don't do anything you know
[1:27:41] they're just they just go to work and
[1:27:43] come home and or couch potatoes and the
[1:27:46] reality is that is so true in too many
[1:27:51] homes but I want you to know that there
[1:27:53] are Godly homes with Godly fathers with
[1:27:57] Godly men who are not having more
[1:28:00] children than they can emotionally
[1:28:03] minister
[1:28:06] to it's not just being a sperm
[1:28:10] donor there's a whole lot more to it
[1:28:12] than that they've got to be
[1:28:15] discipled and when you take on a family
[1:28:18] you take on their problems as well it's
[1:28:21] a big responsibility and it can't be
[1:28:25] neglected and so many times people uh
[1:28:28] resent if anyone tries to bring any kind
[1:28:31] of help or any kind of ministry because
[1:28:34] it causes them to feel guilty for not
[1:28:36] doing their role but that's not what
[1:28:38] this is about this is a family this is
[1:28:41] all men on Deck this is we're helping
[1:28:45] one another are you with me so he said
[1:28:50] remember your leaders and superiors in
[1:28:53] authority for it was they who brought to
[1:28:55] you the word of God observe attentively
[1:28:58] that's not sleeping in
[1:29:01] church you're not attentive if you're
[1:29:05] snoring just just for the record just
[1:29:07] just getting in there and consider their
[1:29:10] manner of living the outcome of their
[1:29:12] Wells spent lives and imitate their
[1:29:15] faith their conviction that God exists
[1:29:19] and is the Creator and ruler of all
[1:29:21] things the provider and bestow of
[1:29:24] Eternal salvation through
[1:29:26] Christ and they're leaning on the entire
[1:29:30] human personality of God in absolute
[1:29:33] trust and confidence in his power wisdom
[1:29:36] and goodness if you question that it
[1:29:39] actually comes right from the original
[1:29:42] because we have a high priest who can be
[1:29:46] touched with the feeling of our
[1:29:48] infirmities because he
[1:29:50] condescended into a a man's body into a
[1:29:54] body of Flesh so that he could
[1:29:57] experience The Temptations and trials of
[1:30:00] humanity so that he could be a perfect
[1:30:03] intercessor on our behalf do you ever
[1:30:06] remind yourself of that do you ever say
[1:30:08] Lord I know you understand I do I've
[1:30:11] heard people pray God you just don't
[1:30:12] know what it's like he knows exactly
[1:30:15] what it's like he does and he planned it
[1:30:19] that way
[1:30:21] intentionally and then we drop down to
[1:30:24] Hebrews 13:17 and 18 in the Amplified
[1:30:27] and we just read it a moment ago in the
[1:30:29] King James it says
[1:30:31] obey I remember quite a discussion here
[1:30:34] some years ago over that word
[1:30:38] obey because some people were just sure
[1:30:40] it didn't mean
[1:30:43] obey just like some people are just sure
[1:30:46] that long hair doesn't mean uncut hair
[1:30:49] it just means longer than normal you
[1:30:52] understand we can reason away or we can
[1:30:55] try to get to the root of what it's
[1:30:56] really trying to tell us it says obey
[1:30:59] your spiritual leaders and submit to
[1:31:02] them continually recognizing their
[1:31:04] authority over you for they are
[1:31:07] constantly keeping watch over your souls
[1:31:09] and guarding your spiritual welfare as
[1:31:13] men who will have to listen who will
[1:31:16] have to render an account for their
[1:31:20] trust do your part to let them do this
[1:31:24] with
[1:31:27] gladness and not with sighing and
[1:31:30] groaning for that would not be
[1:31:34] profitable to you
[1:31:37] either you know one of the ways to keep
[1:31:39] a spiritual leader moving forward is to
[1:31:43] try to treat him in such a way that it's
[1:31:46] not a grief he doesn't dread seeing you
[1:31:50] coming every time you come sometimes you
[1:31:54] come just to say thank you sometimes you
[1:31:57] come just to say I was
[1:32:00] blessed sometimes you come just to say I
[1:32:03] just wanted to tell you brother
[1:32:05] everything's good in my life
[1:32:09] today
[1:32:12] amen if all you ever do is
[1:32:16] complain you're going to grieve your
[1:32:19] leaders that word obey in the Greek do
[1:32:22] you have that definition
[1:32:24] it means to let your heart be convinced
[1:32:27] to put trust in to rely on to have
[1:32:31] confidence in to place hope in and look
[1:32:34] at there in capital
[1:32:36] letters taking
[1:32:38] advice to yield belief in to listen to
[1:32:42] to Aspire to the favor of all those
[1:32:46] Greek definitions for the word obey
[1:32:50] submit would you like to look at it it
[1:32:52] means give way to to to yield to
[1:32:54] someone's authority to give way to
[1:32:57] submit to be submissive to
[1:32:59] surrender and the word watch because he
[1:33:02] watches for the welfare of your soul let
[1:33:04] me tell you what it means it means to
[1:33:07] lose
[1:33:08] sleep it means if you've got a leader if
[1:33:11] you've got a pastor who's willing to
[1:33:13] lose sleep over your
[1:33:18] problem I'm sorry I don't have your
[1:33:20] attention
[1:33:23] if you've got a I'm just saying if you
[1:33:25] do if you don't pray for one you need
[1:33:28] one but if you happen to have somebody
[1:33:31] who's watching for your life and who's
[1:33:34] willing to give up uh sleep and and
[1:33:37] multiple other things to be vigilant in
[1:33:40] awareness of threatening Peril if
[1:33:42] somebody's willing to put out a prayer
[1:33:45] call that says we're in a Warfare season
[1:33:48] and we need to be on
[1:33:50] guard then we all ought to carry the
[1:33:52] burden
[1:33:54] we all ought to realize what a blessing
[1:33:56] and a privilege it is to have somebody
[1:33:59] who's helping us get
[1:34:01] there amen we're just preaching in
[1:34:04] general terms Now 1 Timothy chap 5 verse
[1:34:09] 17 through 22 let the elders that rule
[1:34:13] well be counted worthy of double honor
[1:34:17] especially they who labor in the word
[1:34:21] and
[1:34:22] Doctrine let's go on for the scripture
[1:34:25] saith Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
[1:34:28] treadeth out the corn and the laborer is
[1:34:31] worthy of his
[1:34:34] reward sometimes people start making
[1:34:36] quick calculations in the church and
[1:34:39] they think well I guess that person
[1:34:41] makes at least
[1:34:44] 50,000 so
[1:34:46] that's how much is that for the pastor
[1:34:49] you know and if that family there they
[1:34:52] probably make 60 5 70,000 a year well
[1:34:55] well how much is that for the pastor you
[1:34:58] start adding that all up and the next
[1:35:00] thing you know you've got this
[1:35:02] mentality that your leaders are getting
[1:35:05] rich while you
[1:35:08] suffer if you let the devil talk to you
[1:35:11] that way he'll talk you out of paying
[1:35:14] your tithe and when you quit paying your
[1:35:17] tithe you're cursed with a curse it is
[1:35:20] what the word
[1:35:21] says just remember this is just a little
[1:35:24] side note we're teaching and preaching
[1:35:26] this morning in general terms I'm not
[1:35:29] preaching about
[1:35:31] myself unless I'm guilty if I'm guilty
[1:35:35] then I'm talking also about myself but
[1:35:37] just remember as a side note a personal
[1:35:39] note is my agreement with this body is
[1:35:43] much much fairer than what brother
[1:35:45] Brandon
[1:35:46] proposed I receive a half 50% of your
[1:35:50] tithe that means if you put in $10 in
[1:35:53] the offer offering as tithe I I receive
[1:35:56] $5 minus
[1:35:59] tax now that's what you need to
[1:36:02] calculate you know some people are
[1:36:05] Mighty
[1:36:06] proud when they write out that check for
[1:36:09] $70 they're Mighty proud of that and
[1:36:12] they don't realize when the enemy starts
[1:36:15] telling them the preacher had on new
[1:36:17] shoes I don't by the
[1:36:19] way nothing I have on is new this jacket
[1:36:23] is is about 17 years old and I can
[1:36:26] finally get in it again so I decided to
[1:36:29] wear it
[1:36:32] today the shoes are a little newer than
[1:36:35] that but but not new don't let the devil
[1:36:38] talk to you that
[1:36:40] way and and just remember I don't pay
[1:36:43] social
[1:36:44] security I don't pay
[1:36:47] Medicare somebody said what in the world
[1:36:49] does that mean I know we're getting
[1:36:50] personal and I said I was preaching in
[1:36:52] general terms in here I being very per
[1:36:54] who else is going to tell you this
[1:36:56] nobody absolutely nobody is going to
[1:36:59] tell you this I don't pay social
[1:37:01] security or Medicare so guess what that
[1:37:03] means I don't get
[1:37:05] any when it comes time to receive Social
[1:37:08] Security there won't be any for me when
[1:37:11] it comes time to get Medicare there
[1:37:13] won't be any for me because I don't pay
[1:37:16] it and have never paid it it was an
[1:37:18] option that they gave us many years ago
[1:37:20] I took the option uh somewhat foolishly
[1:37:24] because now I'm on my own you get it and
[1:37:29] uh thank God I'm feeling good physically
[1:37:32] but you know you get old you need a
[1:37:36] little help sometime I'm putting my
[1:37:38] trust in the
[1:37:40] Lord I am I have to it's where I have to
[1:37:43] put my trust I don't have a retirement
[1:37:46] plan here my retirement plan is out of
[1:37:48] this
[1:37:49] world I have health insurance but I got
[1:37:52] a feeling when I get get too old to
[1:37:54] fulfill my duties you'll take that too
[1:37:57] because you'll have to give it to your
[1:37:58] new
[1:38:02] pastor so just remember the devil is a
[1:38:06] liar he will torment your mind he will
[1:38:10] cause you to
[1:38:13] Envy he will cause you to have jealousy
[1:38:16] and it will rob you of your Victory
[1:38:20] it'll also Grieve Your Watchmen
[1:38:25] don't muzzle the ox that tread out the
[1:38:27] corn if someone had a right attitude
[1:38:30] toward leadership they would be so
[1:38:33] thrilled and so happy if they thought
[1:38:35] their Pastor was being
[1:38:37] blessed I'm being honest we need to take
[1:38:41] a little lesson from the
[1:38:42] African-American
[1:38:44] church the one thing they've got right
[1:38:46] is they know how to take care of their
[1:38:48] pastors they don't resent the new
[1:38:51] automobile cuz they know that it's used
[1:38:53] for the kingdom I'm just preaching in
[1:38:56] general terms remember against an elder
[1:38:59] receed not an accusation but before two
[1:39:03] or three Witnesses them that sin rebuke
[1:39:06] before all now now how many times have
[1:39:10] you ever had your feelings
[1:39:15] hurt because you were called on the
[1:39:18] carpet your your situation was
[1:39:21] mentioned while that preacher just gets
[1:39:23] up there and preaches about me all the
[1:39:25] time well I don't think those things
[1:39:27] ought to be handled over the pull pit
[1:39:29] that's well I don't think those things
[1:39:31] ought to ever be said publicly I think
[1:39:33] that ought to be dealt with I think the
[1:39:35] pastor ought to always go to that person
[1:39:38] as an individual and work that out I
[1:39:40] just want you to know that's not what
[1:39:42] the Bible said the Bible told you as PE
[1:39:46] as Believers that's how you're supposed
[1:39:48] to handle your problems with one another
[1:39:51] you're supposed to go to one another and
[1:39:53] sort things out when you offend your
[1:39:55] brother when you know your sister's got
[1:39:57] an offense against you you're supposed
[1:39:59] to go to
[1:40:00] her and work that thing out but a pastor
[1:40:04] is not given the same instruction an
[1:40:06] elder is told them that sin rebuke
[1:40:09] before all that others also May fear
[1:40:14] fear it's not
[1:40:16] easy if a man is a leader and he
[1:40:19] Delights in that he's sick right there's
[1:40:23] not one part of me that thinks that's
[1:40:28] fun I charge thee before God and the
[1:40:31] Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels
[1:40:34] that thou observe these things without
[1:40:36] preferring one before another doing
[1:40:40] nothing by
[1:40:42] partiality people get this idea in their
[1:40:46] mind I'm I'm not being you know looked
[1:40:48] at or looked after or called as much or
[1:40:51] visited as much as some one else you
[1:40:54] know you get your eyes off of that I
[1:40:56] know who you're not looking
[1:40:57] [Music]
[1:40:58] at you're not looking at the word I
[1:41:03] don't know how many times I hear that
[1:41:04] little thing going around I know
[1:41:06] somebody's talking about me you're
[1:41:09] right somebody is it's just almost
[1:41:12] always
[1:41:14] right what are you going to do about it
[1:41:16] that's the question I'm going to get my
[1:41:19] mind on Jesus I'm going to keep on
[1:41:22] keeping on
[1:41:23] I'm going to do what granny said and I'm
[1:41:26] going to say well they got a good
[1:41:28] subject if they're talking about me
[1:41:30] they're leaving somebody else alone I'm
[1:41:32] not going to come to church
[1:41:35] bitter I'm not going to try to get
[1:41:37] everybody to feel sorry for me come on
[1:41:40] that's not what this is about if you are
[1:41:44] struggling with these kind of authority
[1:41:46] issues or you recognize them in your
[1:41:48] family there can be a
[1:41:50] remedy you can lay the a to the root of
[1:41:54] the tree and you can say I'm going to
[1:41:56] deal with addiction and I'm going to
[1:41:58] deal with this but I'm also going to
[1:42:00] deal with a spirit that wants my family
[1:42:02] to resent
[1:42:04] Authority I'm going to set a better
[1:42:10] example you know sometimes when people
[1:42:13] are looking at leadership this the old
[1:42:15] Kingsman song he didn't even shake my
[1:42:22] hand I don't know how many times through
[1:42:25] the
[1:42:26] years for years I stood out front every
[1:42:31] service I was younger then I felt better
[1:42:35] I don't know how many times people walk
[1:42:38] by walked by in those days never saying
[1:42:41] hello never saying God bless you never
[1:42:45] saying that was a good sermon you know
[1:42:47] why cuz they were
[1:42:50] mad they didn't like what was being
[1:42:52] preached
[1:42:53] come on and you know what I would find
[1:42:56] out later they would be telling somebody
[1:42:59] he didn't even shake my hand after that
[1:43:02] sermon and I thought to myself you walk
[1:43:05] right past
[1:43:07] me if you'd have got in lying I would
[1:43:10] have been happy to shake your hand but
[1:43:12] you're the one that's got the
[1:43:14] ought oh my I know no one's happy I can
[1:43:17] tell I can tell you're not but if you if
[1:43:20] you can remember the last time I
[1:43:22] preached a sermon like this this I'll
[1:43:23] stop
[1:43:29] now I didn't think
[1:43:32] so lay hands suddenly on no man neither
[1:43:36] be partaker of other men's
[1:43:38] sins
[1:43:40] keep thyself
[1:43:42] pure let's read that in the
[1:43:45] Amplified let the elders who perform the
[1:43:48] duties of their office well be
[1:43:50] considered double worthy of honor and of
[1:43:53] adequate financial
[1:43:55] support especially those who labor
[1:43:57] Faithfully in preaching and
[1:44:00] teaching for the scripture says you
[1:44:02] shall not muzzle an ox when it is
[1:44:04] treading out the Grain and again the
[1:44:06] laborer is worthy of his hire
[1:44:09] Deuteronomy 25 let's go back Deuteronomy
[1:44:13] 254 Luke 10:7 does anybody know what
[1:44:16] that means it means if you've put an ox
[1:44:19] to a
[1:44:20] job you don't starve the ox
[1:44:23] while he's trampling out the corn
[1:44:26] remember they're stomping on the corn
[1:44:28] you don't muzzle him so that he has
[1:44:30] nothing to
[1:44:33] eat you make sure that he's taken care
[1:44:35] of because he's laboring on your behalf
[1:44:38] right that'd be like a woman not wanting
[1:44:40] to make dinner for her husband
[1:44:43] ever and yet he goes all day and if if
[1:44:47] she's at home particularly and he goes
[1:44:49] all day and works hard and brings the
[1:44:52] money home to Prov provide for the needs
[1:44:54] and the bills of the home and and and
[1:44:56] the wife so you know whatever so carried
[1:44:59] away with Instagram or whatever the case
[1:45:01] might be that she would never want to
[1:45:03] prepare a meal for her husband I'm
[1:45:05] telling you that just wouldn't be
[1:45:08] right this wouldn't be
[1:45:11] right be at
[1:45:14] peace so it's a key listen to No
[1:45:18] accusation presented before a judge
[1:45:20] against an elder unless it is confirmed
[1:45:23] by the testimony of two or three
[1:45:25] witnesses as for those who are guilty
[1:45:27] and persist in sin rebuke and admonish
[1:45:30] them in the presence of all so that the
[1:45:33] rest may be warned and stand in
[1:45:36] wholesome
[1:45:40] awe and
[1:45:42] fear I'll skip some of those scriptures
[1:45:44] are too tough for the crowd this
[1:45:46] morning questions and answers when all
[1:45:49] else fails let's put it off on brother
[1:45:51] brandham questions and answers law
[1:45:55] having a shadow he said we believe in
[1:45:58] church government and the government is
[1:46:01] ordered of the holy spirit in the Bible
[1:46:03] the pastor is always the head of the
[1:46:06] church the pastor is always that's God's
[1:46:09] Elder in organizations you have to come
[1:46:12] through the bishop he's telling you
[1:46:15] that's not our way he said now the Bible
[1:46:18] there's no higher order in the Bible
[1:46:20] than the Elder of the church just tell
[1:46:22] me tell me where it's at he said there's
[1:46:24] no higher order in the Bible for the
[1:46:26] church than the Elder which is the
[1:46:28] pastor he's the highest order of the
[1:46:32] Bible Hebrews chapter 7 number two
[1:46:35] paragraph 282 but the full and complete
[1:46:38] authority of the
[1:46:40] church read that in the Bible see if
[1:46:43] that's not Bible order that's exactly
[1:46:45] right there's no other no one above the
[1:46:47] Elder I have nothing to do with what
[1:46:49] brother Neville does here that's up to
[1:46:51] you and brother Neville
[1:46:54] I I don't think I have that quote this
[1:46:55] morning but brother brandham says
[1:46:57] something that I find to be quite
[1:46:58] interesting at one point he said the
[1:47:00] only thing I have to do with this church
[1:47:02] is I own the
[1:47:06] property he said brother Neville is your
[1:47:09] pastor you're dealing with him if
[1:47:13] there's a problem with him you let me
[1:47:15] know but he said I'm not involved in the
[1:47:18] every daytoday uh you know activities of
[1:47:21] the body
[1:47:23] you let brother Neville do what brother
[1:47:25] Neville's supposed to do and then look
[1:47:27] at Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:47:30] and stay with your pastor see he's the
[1:47:33] shepherd and you give him respects he'll
[1:47:36] lead you through and C cause he's
[1:47:39] ordained of God to do so of course we
[1:47:43] know that's if he stays on the
[1:47:47] word in Jeremiah
[1:47:50] 3:15 woo praise the Lord
[1:47:53] and I will give you
[1:47:56] pastors from today uh from today's sheet
[1:47:59] charity I will give you pastors
[1:48:02] according to mine heart which shall feed
[1:48:05] you with knowledge and understanding
[1:48:08] look at what the Amplified said and I
[1:48:10] will give you spiritual Shepherds after
[1:48:12] my own heart in the final time who will
[1:48:14] feed you with knowledge and
[1:48:16] understanding in
[1:48:17] judgment are you
[1:48:19] there the message says in God doesn't
[1:48:22] call into judgment without warning him
[1:48:24] first paragraph 104 but you see in the
[1:48:27] church that's also from today I think
[1:48:30] there is a pastor and that Pastor is a
[1:48:33] special person he's built to where he
[1:48:36] can put up with fusses of the
[1:48:41] people see see how it works it works
[1:48:46] both
[1:48:47] ways I can't tell you how a pastor ought
[1:48:49] to be treated if I'm not willing to
[1:48:51] carry a burden on
[1:48:53] cuz evidently I'm an
[1:48:55] ox and it's my job he said he's built to
[1:48:59] where he can put up with the fusses of
[1:49:00] the people he's
[1:49:02] AAR burden Bearer he's the
[1:49:05] ox of the team God help him I don't even
[1:49:09] know who he is but I know he needs help
[1:49:12] right he's a man that can sit down
[1:49:15] somebody's got something against
[1:49:16] somebody else and sit down with them two
[1:49:19] families and Tak neither side and reason
[1:49:21] it out and bring it right back into
[1:49:23] sweetness he's a pastor he knows how to
[1:49:27] take care of things my wish we had one I
[1:49:30] truly truly do because he's a special
[1:49:33] built man in the message Revelation book
[1:49:36] of symbols he said your pastor when he
[1:49:39] stands here on the platform ministering
[1:49:41] the word of God he is God's angel to the
[1:49:45] church Messenger to the church therefore
[1:49:49] a pastor should never leave that word
[1:49:52] but stay straight with the word because
[1:49:55] he's
[1:49:56] feeding it's the shepherd's
[1:49:59] place you believe that cuz the word
[1:50:02] pastor means Shepherd look it up find
[1:50:05] out if that ain't right a pastor is a
[1:50:07] shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him
[1:50:09] overseer over a certain flock to feed
[1:50:12] them with what the word of God Amen oh
[1:50:16] my in the message I am the resurrection
[1:50:19] and the life let's just get it all over
[1:50:21] as fast as we can paragraph 49 now now
[1:50:24] then you got to have
[1:50:26] confidence he said this is the house of
[1:50:29] judgment you know I think even the bride
[1:50:32] has somehow Through The Years picked up
[1:50:34] a denominational mindset of what a
[1:50:36] church
[1:50:38] is we we're not here to organize golf
[1:50:43] tournaments we're not here to have a
[1:50:45] softball league this is a house of
[1:50:48] judgment where God comes down listen
[1:50:51] where God comes comes down and passes
[1:50:54] his judgment your your pastor is
[1:50:57] supposed to be a righteous man the
[1:50:59] congregation supposed to be with him
[1:51:03] 100
[1:51:07] 100% you're supposed to be just
[1:51:10] 100%
[1:51:11] together and in there if you're not then
[1:51:14] Satan's got a way to get in right you
[1:51:17] got a loophole somewhere so have
[1:51:19] everything cleared out
[1:51:22] one more you got it in you Hebrews
[1:51:25] chapter 5 and and six number one
[1:51:28] paragraph 26 but I believe in the
[1:51:31] supreme authority of the local assembly
[1:51:34] Let each Church be its
[1:51:38] on choose its pastors deacons or
[1:51:42] whatever it is and then that way the man
[1:51:45] is there has no Bishop over
[1:51:50] him that's really
[1:51:53] something the Holy Spirit wants to speak
[1:51:56] something to that
[1:51:59] church they don't have to ask anybody
[1:52:01] about whether they could do this or do
[1:52:03] that see it's not a
[1:52:08] denomination it's the individual in
[1:52:10] contact with the Holy Spirit he said
[1:52:13] show me by the Bible what's greater in
[1:52:15] the Bible than a local
[1:52:17] Elder to a local
[1:52:20] church each Church in in
[1:52:24] itself he said that's right yes sir the
[1:52:27] sovereignty of the local church each
[1:52:30] Church in itself now Brotherhood that's
[1:52:32] wonderful all churches ought to be in a
[1:52:34] brotherhood like that together but the
[1:52:37] sovereignty of the local church that's
[1:52:41] why it's very disturbing in this hour
[1:52:44] when so many people are posting about
[1:52:46] our Prophet
[1:52:49] Joseph I find it most disturbing because
[1:52:53] if there was ever an anointed Man Who
[1:52:56] Rose on the scene for the past 30 Years
[1:53:00] Around the message if anybody put
[1:53:03] confidence in him they told all over the
[1:53:06] country he thinks he's an eighth
[1:53:09] messenger I mean anybody I can name
[1:53:12] names of men who raised up with gifts
[1:53:16] and godly and and really doing some
[1:53:19] wonderful work in the kingdom of God but
[1:53:22] they were just sure if anybody liked
[1:53:25] him that he was trying to be an eighth
[1:53:28] messenger and the same people mind you
[1:53:31] the same people are posting today we're
[1:53:34] following our Prophet
[1:53:36] Joseph who's the youngest son of brother
[1:53:39] brandham it's absolutely
[1:53:42] ridiculous to try to bring people in
[1:53:45] such a mentality that the only way we
[1:53:48] can believe the message is to come here
[1:53:50] sit here together and listen to brother
[1:53:51] Brandon on to tape every
[1:53:54] service that's the most ridiculous thing
[1:53:57] that I've ever heard of if that's what
[1:54:00] you're looking for you might as well
[1:54:02] just stay at home listen to a tape for
[1:54:06] yourself you didn't come here for that
[1:54:09] every service upon every service upon
[1:54:11] every service we are believing that if
[1:54:14] you see the value of this message you're
[1:54:17] taking time to hear it it's our
[1:54:21] responsibility to hear what has been
[1:54:23] spoken to this day but there's no
[1:54:26] scripture anywhere that tells us that a
[1:54:29] mechanical device has the anointing or
[1:54:31] the ability to perfect the body of
[1:54:34] Christ he said it's a five-fold ministry
[1:54:37] didn't say
[1:54:38] four-fold didn't say
[1:54:40] threefold so that must mean that there
[1:54:42] are apostles today it must mean that
[1:54:46] there are prophets today maybe I need to
[1:54:49] say little p because that makes people
[1:54:51] feel more comfort
[1:54:52] we're not
[1:54:54] Catholics we don't call Micah a minor
[1:54:57] prophet and Isaiah a major prophet if
[1:55:00] they were prophets they were prophets
[1:55:02] we're not following brother Brandon
[1:55:04] because he was a prophet we're following
[1:55:06] him as he followed Christ because the
[1:55:09] word that he preaches lines up with the
[1:55:12] book he was a messenger with a special
[1:55:15] calling and mandate to this generation
[1:55:18] to help return Hearts back to the word
[1:55:23] amen but he himself tells us that
[1:55:26] there's a fivefold Ministry and that
[1:55:28] means Apostles prophets pastors teachers
[1:55:31] and evangelists and we need
[1:55:34] them for you to tell me that every word
[1:55:37] on tape is thus sayith the Lord is
[1:55:39] absolutely
[1:55:41] ridiculous it makes no sense to anybody
[1:55:44] except those who are deluded by that lie
[1:55:47] you can't preach something with a
[1:55:49] progressive revelation
[1:55:52] and then say that when you said it one
[1:55:54] way it was thus sayeth the Lord and then
[1:55:56] when you corrected it and said it
[1:55:58] another way that
[1:56:02] too was thus sayeth the Lord you're
[1:56:05] giving infallibility to a man and
[1:56:08] brother brandom said Christ is the
[1:56:10] infallible one Among Us your pastor me
[1:56:14] I'm not
[1:56:16] infallible oh Lord no I make mistakes
[1:56:19] all the time and I do my best to correct
[1:56:22] them and I've marched many times back to
[1:56:25] this pull pit and backtracked and said I
[1:56:27] missed that I was wrong I didn't say
[1:56:30] that right please forgive me I didn't
[1:56:32] handle that right please forgive me
[1:56:34] that's what we have to do that's what we
[1:56:37] have to do
[1:56:40] amen 1 Corinthians chap 4 verse 14-6 in
[1:56:45] the Amplified said I do not write this
[1:56:47] to shame you but to warn and counsel you
[1:56:51] as my beloved children and it's Paul
[1:56:52] again he said after all though you
[1:56:55] should have 10,000 teachers guides to
[1:56:58] direct you in Christ yet you do not have
[1:57:01] many fathers Paul said for I became your
[1:57:04] father in Christ Jesus Through the Glad
[1:57:08] Tidings of the Gospel so I urge and
[1:57:12] implore you this is Paul speaking to the
[1:57:14] church at Corinth I urge and implore you
[1:57:19] be imitators of
[1:57:20] me follow follow me as I follow Christ
[1:57:25] that's what the first church age
[1:57:26] messenger said how many of you believe
[1:57:28] if that's what the first church age
[1:57:30] messenger said then the last Church age
[1:57:32] messenger would have to say the same
[1:57:33] thing follow me as I follow Christ and
[1:57:37] any leader any Pastor any part of the
[1:57:40] five-fold ministry that's God ordained
[1:57:42] would want to want to say the very same
[1:57:44] thing when I'm wrong if I'm off the word
[1:57:47] let's talk about it let's straighten
[1:57:49] that out let's get that taken care of
[1:57:51] and go on let's don't get further and
[1:57:54] further away from the truth I notic some
[1:57:56] of my big amers are quiet this morning I
[1:57:59] don't understand that first Peter chap 5
[1:58:02] verse 5 and 6 likewise ye young I'm just
[1:58:05] reading you the word I'm not only
[1:58:08] telling you what the pro I'm reading
[1:58:09] right out of the Bible likewise ye
[1:58:11] younger submit yourselves unto the Elder
[1:58:17] right what I see happening as we get
[1:58:20] further and further along is each
[1:58:23] generation shows respect and
[1:58:26] honor less and less in in
[1:58:33] everything you know we were taught even
[1:58:35] in the message of the hour we were
[1:58:37] taught for instance if it's not our
[1:58:39] party in
[1:58:41] charge we respect the
[1:58:44] president I told you before I had very
[1:58:46] little respect for President Obama and
[1:58:49] people have tried to correct me even
[1:58:51] recently I'm I'm telling you you're
[1:58:53] wasting your time I'm thankful that he
[1:58:55] stood for
[1:58:56] Israel the rest of his the rest of his
[1:58:59] mannerisms and and what he was operating
[1:59:01] and trying to do in our nation we're
[1:59:03] still trying to recover from the effect
[1:59:04] of it today I saw in the spirit the
[1:59:07] demon standing behind him when he
[1:59:09] addressed this nation and yet when he
[1:59:11] walked in the room I was privileged to
[1:59:13] be in the room where he was and when he
[1:59:15] walked in the room I stood to my feet
[1:59:18] not because I was afraid of the Secret
[1:59:20] Service but but I actually felt honored
[1:59:23] to be in the room where the president of
[1:59:25] the United States had come in because
[1:59:28] we're told if you can't honor the man
[1:59:31] you honor the office that he
[1:59:34] holds is that right and and younger
[1:59:38] people what we see happening today is
[1:59:40] there's such
[1:59:42] disrespect you know I came from a
[1:59:44] generation where a child a teenager even
[1:59:47] a young married man would never call a
[1:59:50] senior person his SE his senior I don't
[1:59:54] mean a retirement age he would never
[1:59:58] have called a someone senior to him by
[2:00:01] his first
[2:00:07] name especially in the South you would
[2:00:09] add sometimes you would add Mister to
[2:00:12] his first
[2:00:13] name because you knew him too good to
[2:00:16] call him Mr
[2:00:18] Smith that wasn't that didn't seem
[2:00:21] polite enough
[2:00:22] but you didn't want to call him out of
[2:00:24] respect
[2:00:25] Bob so you'd say Mr
[2:00:29] Bob even with our children we did things
[2:00:32] like that people that who were
[2:00:34] particularly close to the family we
[2:00:36] called them all
[2:00:38] Uncle like Chad back there then we had
[2:00:41] to explain later in life we had to
[2:00:45] explain to them well whose brother is
[2:00:47] Chad is he Mama's brother or Daddy's
[2:00:49] brother well
[2:00:50] neither but we wanted to give him a
[2:00:53] little title of endearment because he
[2:00:55] was special to our family so we said
[2:00:59] Uncle you know you may have thought it
[2:01:01] was kind of funny here Tuesday night
[2:01:03] when sister called me Father Papa or
[2:01:05] whatever well I want you to know I get
[2:01:07] that every day I'm not exaggerating
[2:01:10] every day someone greets me from Africa
[2:01:13] or the Philippines or other countries of
[2:01:15] the world either as uncle or
[2:01:19] Papa because it's just it just in their
[2:01:22] culture shows that you are putting some
[2:01:26] respect on the office that somebody
[2:01:31] holds I don't want this generation of
[2:01:35] young people to fear their
[2:01:37] leaders but I want them to understand
[2:01:39] the importance of showing proper respect
[2:01:43] can I just give you a little help here
[2:01:45] when your leader your pastor walks into
[2:01:48] a room where you are it's your
[2:01:50] responsibility to be friend ly to show
[2:01:53] kindness to show
[2:01:55] respect it's just your place and when he
[2:01:59] speaks to you your brother gy let's put
[2:02:01] it all on him when he speaks to you you
[2:02:05] should answer him yes sir that's right
[2:02:09] no sir not because he's so old he is
[2:02:12] getting
[2:02:13] older but not because he's so old but
[2:02:16] because he has
[2:02:17] a an office Among Us you think I've lost
[2:02:21] my my marbles this morning it it bothers
[2:02:25] me and I wouldn't address him by his
[2:02:27] first
[2:02:28] name it doesn't show proper
[2:02:32] respect I don't like when I when I hear
[2:02:35] someone say concerning brother Brandon
[2:02:38] bill I don't even want to hear him say
[2:02:40] brother Bill I don't think that's proper
[2:02:44] respect if you get slack your children
[2:02:47] will be
[2:02:48] slacker your grandchildren will be
[2:02:51] slacker
[2:02:52] do you believe that's happened in the
[2:02:54] church would you believe that in most
[2:02:56] churches in this city today they call
[2:02:58] their Pastor Bob or Joe
[2:03:02] or they call one another by their first
[2:03:05] name instead of saying brother and
[2:03:06] sister like the Bible instructs us to do
[2:03:09] as brethren in the
[2:03:11] faith we need to learn and and and what
[2:03:15] I see is that thing gets bigger and
[2:03:16] bigger and
[2:03:17] bigger if you're in a group of people
[2:03:20] and your pastor your leader speaks to
[2:03:22] you you need to
[2:03:23] listen you need to stop what you're
[2:03:27] doing and
[2:03:29] listen now whether you do what he said
[2:03:32] or not is totally up to you but you need
[2:03:35] to show enough respect that you sto
[2:03:37] doing what you're doing you turn around
[2:03:40] and face the person that's addressing
[2:03:42] you and listen to what they have to say
[2:03:45] oh you're just really
[2:03:48] mad I have been mad before but this is
[2:03:51] not one of those
[2:03:53] times I just want you to understand that
[2:03:56] I believe that one of the ways those
[2:03:58] familiar spirits operate is not just
[2:04:03] addiction it's despising
[2:04:07] Authority
[2:04:09] younger submit
[2:04:11] yourselves unto the Elder yes all of you
[2:04:15] be subject one to another this first
[2:04:17] Peter be subject to one another and be
[2:04:20] clothed
[2:04:22] with
[2:04:23] humility for God resisteth the proud and
[2:04:27] giveth grace to the
[2:04:29] humble I want you to know we're blessed
[2:04:31] to have Elders we're blessed to have
[2:04:33] older Saints who have paid the price who
[2:04:37] stood the test of time give them double
[2:04:41] honor if Jesse wants to walk sister Flo
[2:04:44] out the door or some other brother just
[2:04:47] do it it's not because she's not capable
[2:04:52] if somebody wants to say to some of
[2:04:54] these other sisters sister bever
[2:04:55] somebody let me carry your bag because
[2:04:57] sometimes she comes in here with several
[2:04:58] bags heavy weights of things you say hey
[2:05:01] let me carry that for
[2:05:03] you it's just the right thing to do and
[2:05:07] I want you to know something bigger than
[2:05:08] that God will bless you he'll B you
[2:05:11] bring you bring a cup of cold water in
[2:05:14] the in in in the lord's name let's say
[2:05:16] it that way God will bless you for that
[2:05:18] in the message Revelation 4 number three
[2:05:21] I'm going to skip a lot of scriptures
[2:05:27] here paragraph 161 he says so now see
[2:05:32] now let me go back a little further than
[2:05:33] that go back about the 21st verse while
[2:05:36] you're looking that is paragraph 161 of
[2:05:39] Revelation chapter 4 number
[2:05:41] three he said he's reading the scripture
[2:05:43] here submit yourselves one to another in
[2:05:48] the fear of God and then paragraph 16 to
[2:05:52] he said submit yourself
[2:05:55] congregation submit yourself to your
[2:05:57] pastor
[2:05:59] Pastor I'm going to wait and see if they
[2:06:01] can get this one because this is this is
[2:06:04] to bless you
[2:06:17] too this is
[2:06:19] 1961 January the 8 Revelation chapter 4
[2:06:23] number three Jeff paragraph 161 and 162
[2:06:28] submit yourself congregation submit
[2:06:31] yourself to your pastor
[2:06:34] Pastor I get preached to too Pastor
[2:06:38] submit yourself to your congregation now
[2:06:41] listen listen what that means if a
[2:06:43] little click Rises up one time brother
[2:06:46] Bren said if a little click or a little
[2:06:49] cult Rises up in the church if a little
[2:06:53] click Rises up don't be on either
[2:06:58] side just talk to the pastor submit
[2:07:02] yourself to the whole congregation
[2:07:05] congregation if you start in a
[2:07:08] click submit yourself to your pastor in
[2:07:11] the fear of God see oh
[2:07:15] brother we didn't seem to get that one
[2:07:17] up for you but I I understand I'm glad I
[2:07:19] bragged on them before now
[2:07:23] it's not
[2:07:24] easy it it works both
[2:07:27] ways it works both
[2:07:29] ways let me get off of this let's look
[2:07:33] at another way that Authority can be
[2:07:35] abused Matthew
[2:07:37] 22 oh they're shouting the aisles I mean
[2:07:40] some folks aren't even in here I don't
[2:07:41] know where they
[2:07:42] are Matthew chapter 22 verse 15- 22 then
[2:07:48] went the Pharisees and took counsel how
[2:07:50] they might entangle if you thought it
[2:07:52] was quiet a minute ago just wait just
[2:07:55] wait just wait we're off the pastors now
[2:07:58] just wait then when the Pharisees uh uh
[2:08:02] then went the Pharisees and took counsel
[2:08:04] how they might entangle him in his talk
[2:08:07] and they sent out unto him their
[2:08:08] disciples with the herodians saying
[2:08:11] Master we know that thou art true and
[2:08:13] teach us the way of God in truth neither
[2:08:15] carest thou for any man for thou
[2:08:17] regardest not the person of men woo
[2:08:21] they're slick tell us therefore what
[2:08:24] thinkest thou is it lawful to give
[2:08:27] tribute unto Caesar or
[2:08:33] not oh yes I'm going to enjoy this
[2:08:37] one the pressure is off of
[2:08:40] me but Jesus perceived their wickedness
[2:08:44] and
[2:08:45] said why tempt ye me ye
[2:08:49] Hypocrites show me the tribute money and
[2:08:53] they brought unto him a
[2:08:57] penny and he saith unto them who is this
[2:09:01] image and
[2:09:03] superscription they say unto him
[2:09:06] Caesars then saith he unto them I wish
[2:09:09] this was red letter it is red letter in
[2:09:12] the Bible I wish you saw it in red
[2:09:15] letter render therefore Jesus talking
[2:09:20] render there look see Caesar was
[2:09:24] wicked render therefore unto Caesar the
[2:09:28] things which are
[2:09:29] Caesar and unto God the things that are
[2:09:34] Gods when they heard these words they
[2:09:38] marveled and left him and went their way
[2:09:42] in the Amplified verse 21 reads like
[2:09:44] this they said Caesars then he said to
[2:09:47] them
[2:09:48] pay therefore to Caesar the things that
[2:09:52] are due to
[2:09:54] Caesar and pay to God the things that
[2:09:58] are
[2:10:00] do to God Titus 3:1 put them in mind to
[2:10:04] be subject to principalities and powers
[2:10:07] to obey
[2:10:09] magistrates to be ready to every good
[2:10:19] work now let let me show you what the
[2:10:22] prophet says about such paragraph 78
[2:10:25] questions and answers number three he
[2:10:27] said I'm going to say this just looked
[2:10:29] at a person a few minutes ago uh it was
[2:10:31] asked me by a fine boy the other day we
[2:10:33] was hunting squirrels that morning I got
[2:10:36] five I left one of them for the a for
[2:10:38] that afternoon you only get six in the
[2:10:41] state of Kentucky that's the limit so
[2:10:44] this certain person said I got
[2:10:49] nine Oh no you're going to I'm going to
[2:10:52] slow
[2:10:55] you if you can't say nothing just groan
[2:10:57] just groan
[2:10:59] oh I got nine Christian boy fine
[2:11:04] kid and I said brother bandam said to
[2:11:07] the Fine kid who bragged about getting
[2:11:09] nine when the legal limit was six hear
[2:11:14] me he said you done
[2:11:17] wrong you did
[2:11:19] wrong he said
[2:11:21] well I said I had five that morning and
[2:11:24] save one for that afternoon and when I
[2:11:26] got that one squirrel looked in a tree
[2:11:28] and counted five or six sitting there
[2:11:31] where I could look at them walked
[2:11:34] out and left them because that's what a
[2:11:36] man of integrity would
[2:11:38] do because Caesar said that in Kentucky
[2:11:41] the limit is
[2:11:44] six he said I walked up here in a tree
[2:11:48] not long ago and there was about 15 or
[2:11:50] 20 sitting there I just took the
[2:11:53] limit and walked
[2:11:55] away and left the rest of them there I
[2:11:59] said if I come to this country and
[2:12:01] preach to you boys and you people hear
[2:12:03] the thing that's right I've got to live
[2:12:05] that
[2:12:06] example Christianity ain't what you
[2:12:09] say it's what you live it's what you do
[2:12:12] it's an example you're the salt of the
[2:12:15] earth uh brother Nathan prayed this
[2:12:18] morning he he said I I said then the law
[2:12:23] says the law
[2:12:25] says Jesus said you give Caesar the
[2:12:29] things that belong to Caesar you break
[2:12:31] that speed law out
[2:12:35] there said what are you doing you're
[2:12:38] doing
[2:12:41] wrong let me get me some
[2:12:45] water while you speed demon process
[2:12:53] what are you doing you're doing wrong
[2:12:55] you
[2:12:56] sin he said give Caesar what's Caesar's
[2:13:00] and God what's God's listen this is a
[2:13:04] man we're talking about a man who had so
[2:13:07] much
[2:13:09] Integrity not only in the natural things
[2:13:12] but the spiritual thing remember in the
[2:13:14] natural things he told his wife to lie
[2:13:16] for
[2:13:18] him to the IRS the The Infernal Revenue
[2:13:25] system and then had to go back and speak
[2:13:28] to the representative and apologize to
[2:13:30] him for
[2:13:33] lying wait a minute I'm not hearing
[2:13:35] enough amens come on that's Integrity he
[2:13:40] had so much Integrity even on spiritual
[2:13:43] things that he believed it was s to fish
[2:13:46] or hunt on Sunday he didn't say it once
[2:13:51] he said it multiple times he even says a
[2:13:53] Believer wouldn't do
[2:13:57] that he said I have swam out in the
[2:14:01] river in the cold River on a Saturday
[2:14:05] night to
[2:14:07] unate my Trot
[2:14:11] Line because I didn't want to be
[2:14:15] guilty of fishing on the Lord's
[2:14:18] day we can go to this whole thing
[2:14:21] Sunday's not the Lord's Day Saturday's
[2:14:22] the Lord's day all right then if that's
[2:14:24] how you feel don't be fishing and
[2:14:27] hunting and doing those things on a
[2:14:32] Saturday but what I find is Extreme
[2:14:35] Sabbath
[2:14:37] people they'll say well Sunday's not the
[2:14:40] Lord's day anyway and then they won't
[2:14:42] make Saturday the Lord's day every day
[2:14:45] is the Lord's day but the word tells us
[2:14:48] something's supposed to be set apart
[2:14:50] holy and and Sanctified unto the Lord
[2:14:53] isn't that right come on now I know it's
[2:14:57] not
[2:14:59] popular he said then you did what Jesus
[2:15:02] told you not to do he said and if you
[2:15:04] don't let's go back he said well the law
[2:15:07] is wrong this is what the what the man
[2:15:09] said to him the law is
[2:15:11] wrong how many of you have ever felt
[2:15:13] like the law was wrong I
[2:15:17] have how many of you have ever felt like
[2:15:20] that 30 5 on a highway for
[2:15:24] Lane is too
[2:15:28] slow I've even said to people in in in
[2:15:32] traveling with them I've even said to
[2:15:33] them look we don't know there's got to
[2:15:35] be some reason I don't like it I don't
[2:15:37] like it it's ridiculous it don't make
[2:15:39] any
[2:15:40] sense but there must be a
[2:15:44] reason well yeah the law is just trying
[2:15:46] to take all our rights away from us no
[2:15:48] there's a possibility that there a death
[2:15:51] trap
[2:15:55] there if I was making the law I would go
[2:15:58] out there and look up here I'm preaching
[2:16:00] to
[2:16:02] you if I was uh in charge of the law I'd
[2:16:05] go up there to the BP and I would put a
[2:16:08] 25 speed limit on that intersection on
[2:16:11] the four-lane
[2:16:12] highway and there'd be a lot less
[2:16:15] accidents and a lot less uh hospital
[2:16:17] visits and ambulance take because people
[2:16:19] don't know how to operate in that
[2:16:22] intersection and it would be worth
[2:16:24] somebody's while to slow down to pay
[2:16:28] attention to what they're doing rather
[2:16:30] than to be hauled out in an
[2:16:32] ambulance sometimes there's reasons we
[2:16:34] don't know you wouldn't think that would
[2:16:35] be such a crazy place but it
[2:16:38] is he said now yeah the law is wrong I
[2:16:41] can't help what wrong it
[2:16:43] is it's wrong to break Jesus
[2:16:46] commandment what commandment is he
[2:16:48] talking about he's telling us now let's
[2:16:50] see if you're
[2:16:51] hearing he said and if you don't give
[2:16:54] Caesar the things that
[2:16:56] Caesars then you did what Jesus told you
[2:16:59] not to
[2:17:00] do and the listen and the transgression
[2:17:04] of the law is sin that's right now
[2:17:07] brother brandham is is taking the law of
[2:17:09] the
[2:17:11] land and giving it equal
[2:17:14] place with the law of the
[2:17:17] word that's pretty serious comparison
[2:17:21] he said and this will make us all feel
[2:17:23] better we're all
[2:17:26] guilty we do it but we but here's the
[2:17:30] key when you see yourself
[2:17:35] wrong oh praise the Lord we're just
[2:17:39] growing by Leaps and Bounds in the
[2:17:40] spirit this morning aren't
[2:17:42] we he said but when you see yourself
[2:17:45] wrong stop
[2:17:49] it you may forget
[2:17:51] it but when you catch yourself
[2:17:55] again stop it and here's the reason he
[2:17:59] said people are watching
[2:18:08] you you know people know where you go to
[2:18:12] church are you looking this way that's
[2:18:15] proper
[2:18:18] respect people know where you go to
[2:18:20] church church or somebody to go and say
[2:18:23] I'm just going to break the law I'm just
[2:18:24] going to do I'm that's
[2:18:28] wrong you're reflecting not only on your
[2:18:31] family you're reflecting on your church
[2:18:33] you're reflecting on your
[2:18:35] savior he said when you see yourself
[2:18:37] wrong stop it people are watching you
[2:18:39] people won't go to church but they'll
[2:18:41] read
[2:18:43] you see what you
[2:18:45] do and I want the balance on that and
[2:18:48] I'm going to give it to you in the last
[2:18:49] one in the message once more 1963
[2:18:52] brother bam gives us a good balance here
[2:18:54] he said but I know that if they have a
[2:18:57] law here A Fire Marshal's law just so
[2:19:00] many you have to leave so many aisles so
[2:19:03] much aisle and so forth and that they
[2:19:05] cannot help because that we are as
[2:19:08] Christians we've got to do that he said
[2:19:10] for the Bible said Jesus told us to give
[2:19:13] Caesar those things that pertain to
[2:19:15] Caesar and then to God those things that
[2:19:17] belongs to God so we try to and and
[2:19:20] listen listen and if we will not obey
[2:19:26] Caesar it's doubtful that we'd obey God
[2:19:29] let's get the balance let's here's the
[2:19:32] balance and as long as Caesar's laws
[2:19:35] doesn't
[2:19:39] interfere with
[2:19:42] Gods somebody said pastor didn't you
[2:19:44] open this church when we were under a
[2:19:46] lockdown I
[2:19:48] did because I found a place
[2:19:51] where Caesar's
[2:19:53] laws and God's laws didn't
[2:20:00] jha you see Caesar's law as long as
[2:20:03] Caesar's laws don't interfere with Gods
[2:20:05] we must obey God in what order first Our
[2:20:10] obligation is to the spirit law the
[2:20:13] spiritual law first and then the natural
[2:20:16] law he said we must obey God first and
[2:20:20] then these fire hazards and so forth
[2:20:22] well they know how to take care of that
[2:20:25] and they told us he's just talking about
[2:20:27] restrictions that are placed on
[2:20:29] Gatherings and so forth we're going to
[2:20:30] put God
[2:20:32] first I want you to put up the last oh
[2:20:34] it's can you all believe it's just
[2:20:38] 115 I got 45 more
[2:20:41] minutes isin't it amazing don't you you
[2:20:44] know sometimes people go out here and
[2:20:45] they say it didn't seem like two and a
[2:20:47] half hours I guarantee you you won't say
[2:20:49] that today
[2:20:55] you might say he preached 45 minutes
[2:20:56] less and it seemed like 4 hours
[2:20:58] longer that's what it means to be in the
[2:21:00] hot
[2:21:02] spot now look at there's a
[2:21:06] twin there's a twin
[2:21:09] behavior that runs along with authority
[2:21:15] issues let let me just make sure before
[2:21:18] we put this next definition up that you
[2:21:20] follow what I'm
[2:21:23] saying you've got to
[2:21:25] respect the structure of a
[2:21:29] [Music]
[2:21:30] family I know that step stuff and that
[2:21:33] half
[2:21:35] stuff can get hard to Wade through
[2:21:38] sometime it
[2:21:41] can I I know that sometimes it's hard to
[2:21:45] be
[2:21:47] fair and I know that everybody says well
[2:21:50] I'm going to love my stepchildren just
[2:21:52] like my children blood children and some
[2:21:56] people find that easier to do than
[2:21:58] others I believe everybody intends to do
[2:22:01] that I believe that good people set out
[2:22:05] to do
[2:22:06] that but it's not always
[2:22:10] possible because some kids are just
[2:22:18] broken and you don't heal them by
[2:22:20] breaking them
[2:22:22] further the only way to heal them is
[2:22:25] love them and help them and try not to
[2:22:28] show partiality between
[2:22:31] them and that's not easy to do it's
[2:22:34] easier for
[2:22:35] [Music]
[2:22:37] some than it is for
[2:22:40] others my grandmother and my grandfather
[2:22:43] did a good
[2:22:44] job they had two sons and a daughter and
[2:22:47] the two sons had more than one wife wife
[2:22:51] my dad two wives my uncle
[2:22:55] many and my grandmother and my
[2:22:58] grandfather determined in their
[2:23:01] mind to say to their sons I was there
[2:23:04] multiple times they said to their sons
[2:23:06] just because you're through with her my
[2:23:08] mother for instance
[2:23:10] Jane I heard my granddad and my
[2:23:12] grandmother say to my dad multiple times
[2:23:15] just because you're through with
[2:23:17] Jane just because you put her away
[2:23:21] you're done with her doesn't mean we
[2:23:24] are don't expect
[2:23:27] us to put her
[2:23:29] out because you put her out now ain't
[2:23:32] that
[2:23:33] something now we're not going to
[2:23:35] mistreat your wife 2 three four however
[2:23:38] many we're going to be as good to them
[2:23:40] as we possibly can just know that we may
[2:23:43] not be done with them by the time you
[2:23:46] are and we're going to include them
[2:23:49] we're going to treat them the same
[2:23:51] if we can't give a birthday present to
[2:23:53] all of them we're not giving to any of
[2:23:56] them you know my dad and my uncle they
[2:23:59] resented
[2:24:01] that because in their mind at that time
[2:24:03] in their
[2:24:05] life if she's not good for me she ought
[2:24:08] not to be good for you but sometimes we
[2:24:11] get mature enough to
[2:24:13] understand folks are
[2:24:16] broken we're
[2:24:19] healers come on we're not those who want
[2:24:21] to make things worse we want to make
[2:24:25] things
[2:24:29] better so you've got to respect the
[2:24:31] structure of a family you've got to
[2:24:33] learn to it's not
[2:24:36] easy but you've got to learn to do
[2:24:40] it you you made the decision and now you
[2:24:43] can't check
[2:24:46] out I hate some time in in my experience
[2:24:51] through the years as a pastor I've seen
[2:24:53] a poor woman put in the
[2:24:57] middle between her husband now and her
[2:25:01] children from the from a previous
[2:25:04] relationship that's a hard on a
[2:25:08] woman now just remember this is coming
[2:25:10] from someone who doesn't believe in
[2:25:12] double
[2:25:14] marriage remember I don't think you
[2:25:16] ought have done it in the first
[2:25:19] place but if you
[2:25:22] did you got to live with
[2:25:26] it don't let those Authority issues
[2:25:32] continue to disturb the
[2:25:36] peace love them into
[2:25:40] submission there is a way to
[2:25:43] heal what the past has
[2:25:47] broken yes pastor that's right that's
[2:25:51] right if you've been betrayed by your
[2:25:54] pastor give your present pastor at least
[2:25:56] a
[2:25:58] chance if you've been mistreated by a a
[2:26:02] boss on a job just try your best to give
[2:26:05] your present boss a an opportunity to
[2:26:08] prove that he might want to do a little
[2:26:10] bit better in line don't let that
[2:26:12] authority issue or that man hating issue
[2:26:15] or that woman hating issue be something
[2:26:18] that travels with the spirit
[2:26:21] through your
[2:26:22] Generations in
[2:26:24] closing there is a behavior that
[2:26:27] manifest in the same
[2:26:30] way when a familiar spirit is present
[2:26:33] and this runs right along with authority
[2:26:36] issue it's
[2:26:40] Rebellion let's let's look at the uh the
[2:26:43] definition of that let's go out with a
[2:26:45] bang Rebellion opposition and defiance
[2:26:51] toward rules and our overseers see how
[2:26:53] it runs carry a sense of mistreatment
[2:26:57] and that life is
[2:27:00] unfair this often comes from comparing
[2:27:03] their life with someone
[2:27:07] else's and this manifests with
[2:27:11] stubbornness and resistance to
[2:27:15] change this sometimes manifests as
[2:27:18] chronic
[2:27:22] divisiveness always causing a
[2:27:28] division it's rooted in
[2:27:32] Rebellion I was doing a little study
[2:27:36] yesterday on the difference between envy
[2:27:39] and
[2:27:41] jealousy did you know that jealousy can
[2:27:44] be a positive thing
[2:27:48] right the Bible said so
[2:27:51] God is a jealous
[2:27:53] God the definition of jealousy is when
[2:27:58] you are feeling
[2:28:01] threatened and you protect what is
[2:28:06] yours so God said I'm a jealous
[2:28:09] God he's going to protect what's his all
[2:28:13] jealousy is not
[2:28:15] good because some people become so
[2:28:18] paranoid that somebody is out to get
[2:28:20] their
[2:28:24] husband are you
[2:28:35] kidding I know it does
[2:28:38] happen but the reality is you barely
[2:28:40] want
[2:28:44] him why would you think everybody else
[2:28:46] is after him
[2:28:50] some people will let jealousy control
[2:28:52] their
[2:28:54] life you don't want
[2:28:57] that Envy is
[2:29:00] different Envy is never mentioned one
[2:29:03] positive time in the
[2:29:05] Bible most of the time we call Behavior
[2:29:09] jealousy and it's never it's hardly ever
[2:29:11] jealous it's almost always
[2:29:15] envious to Envy means to as the
[2:29:19] definition say to compare what you've
[2:29:21] got with somebody else's and wished you
[2:29:23] had
[2:29:24] it nothing wrong with wishing that
[2:29:27] something that you could have a certain
[2:29:29] thing that's not wrong as long as you
[2:29:31] keep it in its proper place but that
[2:29:33] thing will destroy people's
[2:29:39] minds comparing you
[2:29:42] know I've had even most recently someone
[2:29:45] mentioned to me uh in their in their own
[2:29:48] stress and in their their own trial
[2:29:51] they've said well don't you know that
[2:29:54] I'd like to have a
[2:29:58] vacation well
[2:30:01] sure who wouldn't like to have a
[2:30:06] vacation but sometimes it's just not
[2:30:11] affordable it's just not possible
[2:30:15] sometimes if you watch after somebody
[2:30:18] else's
[2:30:20] and you let that make you
[2:30:23] [Music]
[2:30:25] bitter you lose you get this place of
[2:30:28] entitlement and you you start comparing
[2:30:31] your day
[2:30:35] trip I'm going to preach this real hard
[2:30:37] cuz I'm fixing to go away for a couple
[2:30:39] weeks I'm going to make this I'm just
[2:30:42] kidding I mean I'm not kidding I am a
[2:30:44] sometime later in the
[2:30:47] month but that's not what this little
[2:30:50] spurt is
[2:30:52] about if you get your eyes on somebody
[2:30:56] else's their
[2:30:59] car even their CH their family their
[2:31:04] children I wish my children would have
[2:31:06] turned out like
[2:31:09] that I I wished I could have that kind
[2:31:12] of a
[2:31:14] vacation you we should welcome
[2:31:17] our new
[2:31:20] yepy
[2:31:23] neighbors I I guess everybody knows by
[2:31:26] now that a real prayer has been answered
[2:31:29] for
[2:31:31] me I desired from the
[2:31:34] beginning when they started cut those
[2:31:36] trees out up there that somebody in this
[2:31:39] body would be able to occupy that
[2:31:41] house particularly that one because of
[2:31:45] how close it is to the tree line and as
[2:31:48] of yesterday brother Austin and sister
[2:31:51] Anna and their family moved
[2:31:53] in we've got yepy
[2:31:58] neighbors thank God for doing that for
[2:32:03] them you ride by and you see how nice it
[2:32:07] is don't you
[2:32:11] let don't you
[2:32:13] let you learn to celebrate somebody
[2:32:16] else's success thank God
[2:32:20] you made a way
[2:32:22] Lord and it's not wrong to say if you
[2:32:24] made a way for somebody else you can
[2:32:26] make a way for
[2:32:28] me that's not
[2:32:30] wrong but it would be wrong to say for
[2:32:33] instance I might say why that houses
[2:32:36] double the value of where I live and
[2:32:39] have lived for 30-some years but you
[2:32:41] know what I don't let that cross my mind
[2:32:45] right now I'm where I want to be that's
[2:32:48] why when my family send sends me
[2:32:50] advertisements of houses for sale I just
[2:32:52] say well that's a nice
[2:32:55] house oh that's really ni isn't that
[2:32:57] nice that's wonderful but right now I'm
[2:32:59] where I want to
[2:33:04] be I'm not going to let Envy get in my
[2:33:07] heart and affect the church
[2:33:12] body don't you either don't you let it
[2:33:15] happen don't you let it happen you
[2:33:18] celebrate
[2:33:19] you celebrate somebody else you thank
[2:33:22] God don't let something get in your
[2:33:24] heart like this and we're we're going to
[2:33:26] close Rebellion I want to show that
[2:33:29] before we
[2:33:31] leave it runs with those authority issue
[2:33:34] opposition and Defiance toward rules
[2:33:37] Andor overseers carry a sense of
[2:33:40] mistreatment oh I know people like this
[2:33:43] I know people like this do you know
[2:33:47] anybody like this I know people like
[2:33:49] like
[2:33:51] this they carry a sense of mistreatment
[2:33:54] and that life is
[2:33:56] unfair this often comes from comparing
[2:33:59] their life with someone else's and this
[2:34:01] manifests with stubbornness and
[2:34:03] resistance to change as we read a moment
[2:34:06] chronic divisiveness or divisiveness
[2:34:09] some people say you don't want that in
[2:34:13] your
[2:34:13] life and let me show you why here's the
[2:34:16] scripture 1st Samuel chapter 15 and
[2:34:19] verse
[2:34:22] 23 for
[2:34:26] Rebellion that's Defiance to to to rules
[2:34:30] to Authority or even to
[2:34:35] change
[2:34:36] Rebellion is as the sin
[2:34:39] of Witchcraft and stubbornness
[2:34:44] ohoh that's not
[2:34:46] steadfastness we're steadfast on the
[2:34:49] word yes but we're stubborn when we
[2:34:51] demand our
[2:34:53] ways there's a difference when we stand
[2:34:57] on the Integrity of the word we can be
[2:34:58] steadfast when it's our way or no
[2:35:03] way nobody wants to follow
[2:35:12] that Rebellion is as the sin of
[2:35:15] Witchcraft and stubbornness as is as
[2:35:18] iniquity and idolatry see there it
[2:35:22] runs the word of the Lord said because
[2:35:25] thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord
[2:35:28] Samuel to
[2:35:30] Saul he hath also rejected thee from
[2:35:34] being
[2:35:36] King he wouldn't do what God Said do he
[2:35:40] made an excuse for not doing what God
[2:35:43] Said do come on and it cost
[2:35:47] him his influence and position
[2:35:51] because when when when he decided to do
[2:35:53] it his own way he just thought he had a
[2:35:56] better
[2:35:57] idea but in his heart it was Rebellion
[2:36:01] against the word of the Lord and God
[2:36:04] said it's the same as if you were
[2:36:06] practicing with a
[2:36:09] witch it's it's like worshiping an
[2:36:13] idol when you're so
[2:36:17] stubborn oh oh
[2:36:20] Hallelujah don't worry I'll buy my own
[2:36:25] lunch we don't want
[2:36:27] that I don't think anybody in the body
[2:36:30] of Christ wants to be under that kind of
[2:36:32] rebellion you know and and what often
[2:36:35] happens when you're under it is you may
[2:36:38] be
[2:36:40] 56 but you act like you're six
[2:36:50] and that's pretty confusing to
[2:36:54] six-year-olds or 16y
[2:36:57] olds we've got to believe that the Lord
[2:37:00] is going to help
[2:37:03] us we want to speak as positive as we
[2:37:10] can about
[2:37:12] dignitaries Bible tells us
[2:37:15] to leaders whether they are natural
[2:37:18] leaders or spiritual leaders and like
[2:37:20] I've told you before sometimes you have
[2:37:22] to look extra hard to buy the Mother's
[2:37:25] Day
[2:37:28] card or the Father's Day card sometime
[2:37:31] you have to do like I did for years you
[2:37:33] buy a blank one and write in it what you
[2:37:35] can think to
[2:37:39] say because you can't just go in there
[2:37:41] and generically just pick one off that
[2:37:43] says you've been there for me my whole
[2:37:46] life when you hadn't heard from them in
[2:37:48] 25 years
[2:37:50] see but God didn't say honor them if
[2:37:53] they're worthy of
[2:37:55] honor he said if you honor your parents
[2:37:59] you're going to have a long
[2:38:01] life if you don't honor you're going to
[2:38:03] pay a prize so it works in the natural
[2:38:06] and in the spiritual and if we don't get
[2:38:09] a hold of something like that eating in
[2:38:11] this
[2:38:12] generation it'll get
[2:38:14] worse in the next one and the next one
[2:38:17] if Jesus terries and the next
[2:38:20] one let's stand musicians are
[2:38:30] coming
[2:38:41] sorry I have 238 text
[2:38:50] most of them full of
[2:38:53] love if I was ashamed of what I was
[2:38:56] saying this morning I wouldn't have said
[2:38:57] it to the whole
[2:38:59] world but I know it's
[2:39:01] awkward I have felt the
[2:39:06] awkwardness but who would who would do
[2:39:09] it I want you to know this let me tell
[2:39:11] you this when I was an
[2:39:15] evangelist when I went from church to
[2:39:17] church I made sure
[2:39:20] sure that I honored the
[2:39:23] house it's the right thing to
[2:39:26] do I heard brother brandham do
[2:39:30] it I I did it before I ever heard
[2:39:33] brother brandham but I heard brother
[2:39:34] brandham do it he would honor those men
[2:39:37] on the platform some of them teaching
[2:39:39] false
[2:39:41] Doctrine a third or a half of them
[2:39:45] trinitarian he might have just said
[2:39:48] demons travel in the
[2:39:51] titles but he' turn turn around and look
[2:39:54] at everyone now you outstanding men of
[2:39:57] God and Men of Integrity and when I was
[2:40:00] an evangelist and I went to a church to
[2:40:02] preach I probably could see more wrong
[2:40:04] in that church than anybody else as a
[2:40:07] visitor but I made sure to build up the
[2:40:12] pastor so that he didn't have to build
[2:40:14] up
[2:40:15] himself do you understand what I
[2:40:18] mean I'd often preach on showing the
[2:40:21] pastor love and showing the pastor
[2:40:23] respect because there are just certain
[2:40:26] things that are hard for a pastor to
[2:40:30] say if that wasn't necessary this
[2:40:33] morning I wouldn't have brought
[2:40:35] it but it is necessary it's part of the
[2:40:39] balance and I don't know about all
[2:40:41] preachers but I don't want anybody so
[2:40:43] afraid they can't greet me that's not
[2:40:46] what I
[2:40:47] want and and I want to have a a at least
[2:40:51] a somewhat of an
[2:40:54] approachable
[2:40:56] spirit I could have brought some other
[2:41:00] quotations brother brandom said you know
[2:41:02] some people are looking for a
[2:41:04] friend he said that's
[2:41:07] impossible he said a spiritual leader
[2:41:10] just couldn't possibly be a friend to
[2:41:12] everybody he said just not possible and
[2:41:15] said but that's not what God raised him
[2:41:17] up for
[2:41:20] he he also said if I spent time with
[2:41:23] people all the
[2:41:25] time he said then I wouldn't have the
[2:41:27] word of the Lord for
[2:41:30] you when it came
[2:41:33] time and I want you to know that whether
[2:41:36] we recognize it or not that's the most
[2:41:38] valuable
[2:41:39] thing when brother gy or your pastor
[2:41:42] comes and we bring you what the Lord has
[2:41:44] given that is what we need in this hour
[2:41:49] Lord let it always be true let it be on
[2:41:52] the word Let It Be Right let it be
[2:41:56] without
[2:41:56] compromise let it be without
[2:41:59] prejudice let it just be what we need
[2:42:03] even if it's not what we
[2:42:05] want because we don't want our children
[2:42:08] to struggle the way we have struggled
[2:42:10] that's right or our grandchildren
[2:42:12] struggle the
[2:42:15] way if we go
[2:42:18] from P
[2:42:21] to brother to first name
[2:42:26] basis what do you think the next step
[2:42:28] will be hey
[2:42:31] you haven't you seen it in the word
[2:42:34] haven't you seen it in the
[2:42:37] world here in the South it it it's gone
[2:42:40] from yes
[2:42:43] ma'am to yes to yeah
[2:42:49] on now and now it's
[2:42:53] worse why are you screaming at
[2:42:56] me that's the
[2:42:59] Rebellion I got I want you to know that
[2:43:02] if if I would have said to my
[2:43:05] mother what I
[2:43:09] hear I would have had a broke jaw I'm
[2:43:13] not exaggerating I would have had a
[2:43:15] broke
[2:43:16] jaw you may not like me
[2:43:20] but I'm your mother she would have said
[2:43:22] and you're not going to talk to me that
[2:43:24] way if we don't get ah hold of these
[2:43:26] things that's when they become
[2:43:28] generational and they just keep on
[2:43:32] going we ought to find a better
[2:43:35] way isn't that the truth let's Worship
[2:43:39] the Lord do do you have any energy left
[2:43:41] do you have any heart
[2:43:45] left I don't even have a song to go with
[2:43:47] that Benjamin so I hope you do
[2:43:54] we could sing you know there's a
[2:43:56] preacher in the church oh my Lord and He
[2:43:58] won't do right oh my Lord so what do we
[2:44:00] do kick him out kick him out and let the
[2:44:02] church roll on we could do that

[2:49:45] all family
[2:49:47] line we carry
[2:49:50] some sense
[2:49:52] of disrespect to
[2:49:57] authority authority issues if it's
[2:50:00] because of men if it's because of family
[2:50:04] if it's because of church
[2:50:06] abuse doesn't matter what the cost today
[2:50:09] Lord we we don't want it that's we just
[2:50:13] don't want it it not only affects our
[2:50:16] spiritual life but it'll go with our
[2:50:19] it'll go with us to our job and it'll
[2:50:21] affect our
[2:50:22] family it'll affect our
[2:50:25] children and so Lord we just bring to
[2:50:28] you our hurts and our betrayals and our
[2:50:32] wounds and all the times that we've been
[2:50:35] let down by those who were
[2:50:38] commissioned to protect us and keep
[2:50:42] us like mbth of old we've been
[2:50:47] dropped we've had had some
[2:50:50] heartbreak and we are thankful that you
[2:50:54] have given us Grace to keep pressing
[2:50:58] on but if somehow we have built up a
[2:51:01] resentment toward any
[2:51:04] Authority especially Spiritual Authority
[2:51:07] Lord we we come before you
[2:51:10] today and we ask that you would forgive
[2:51:15] us and heal us
[2:51:19] once again we ask that you would cut us
[2:51:22] off from the
[2:51:24] past I believe your blood is sufficient
[2:51:28] to sever the tithes of from
[2:51:34] yesterday I believe that your blood can
[2:51:37] break any
[2:51:39] yoke that we carry from past
[2:51:43] experience past hurt or past abuse
[2:51:48] we don't want to be careless with our
[2:51:52] trust we don't want our confidence to be
[2:51:55] solely in
[2:51:57] man we want our confidence to be in
[2:52:01] you but we also recognize the balance of
[2:52:05] the scripture when you tell us not to
[2:52:06] just cast our confidence
[2:52:09] away because we've been failed if if if
[2:52:12] a husband and a
[2:52:14] wife were to do such a thing as that
[2:52:18] there would never be healing in a
[2:52:21] marriage if they held a
[2:52:23] grudge if they weren't willing to let it
[2:52:26] go so Lord we just submit every part of
[2:52:30] who we are to you right now and we
[2:52:33] confess that with your strength it is
[2:52:35] our desire to let go our past hurts and
[2:52:39] our
[2:52:41] betrayals and those times that we have
[2:52:43] been dropped or let down because we
[2:52:46] don't want that thing running like
[2:52:50] iniquity through our
[2:52:53] families oh
[2:52:55] Jesus we want our children and our
[2:52:58] grandchildren to learn the ways of
[2:53:01] respect and honor we want the house of
[2:53:04] the Lord to be a place where a culture
[2:53:07] of
[2:53:08] honor is
[2:53:12] upheld we can see the
[2:53:16] humanity of a prophet we can can see the
[2:53:19] humanity of a pastor a teacher or an
[2:53:23] evangelist without disregarding the call
[2:53:26] that you've placed on their
[2:53:29] lives I pray that you'll help us we can
[2:53:32] look over the flaw of a boss man and
[2:53:35] even a
[2:53:37] president if you'll give us the grace to
[2:53:39] do
[2:53:40] it we reach for something higher in you
[2:53:43] and we recognize that there are things
[2:53:46] that affect us that keep keep us from
[2:53:49] climbing this
[2:53:50] mountain and we want to go
[2:53:53] higher and we need to be
[2:53:56] released from some of this heavy baggage
[2:53:59] if you are here and you sense that
[2:54:02] you're uh carrying around a load that's
[2:54:05] pretty heavy from from
[2:54:07] yesterday from the
[2:54:09] past that that affect the way that you
[2:54:13] deal sometime with authority if you can
[2:54:16] see that I'm not trying to find you but
[2:54:20] maybe You' just slip up your hand and
[2:54:21] agree with this prayer right now Lord I
[2:54:24] want to be healed I want to be
[2:54:27] whole I don't want to hold someone in my
[2:54:29] life now
[2:54:31] accountable for something that someone
[2:54:33] else
[2:54:34] did I don't want to be prejudiced toward
[2:54:37] somebody that you bring into my life now
[2:54:39] because someone else let me down or
[2:54:42] abused me or failed me I I I want to let
[2:54:45] the past be the past I'm thankful that
[2:54:49] these things didn't come to stay they
[2:54:52] came to pass Lord see every hand right
[2:54:54] now and and the and and the
[2:54:59] Heart see that right now and pour
[2:55:03] oil I think the only way to break it to
[2:55:06] move forward is to see healing take
[2:55:09] place You Are the
[2:55:12] Healer oh yes your bomb is healing and
[2:55:17] it it restores
[2:55:20] s and it
[2:55:23] ministers and and the reality is Lord
[2:55:27] there have been
[2:55:29] times that a Shepherd had to break a
[2:55:34] leg I noticed it brother Brandon when
[2:55:37] he's telling that he always said and the
[2:55:40] shepherd
[2:55:43] strayed and we know that he didn't mean
[2:55:46] that the shepherd went out of the way it
[2:55:48] in in the in the things that are
[2:55:51] right but he was telling us that the
[2:55:53] shepherd was willing to leave the the
[2:55:55] pack and go after that
[2:55:58] one and after several times of having to
[2:56:01] go get
[2:56:02] somebody the shepherd realized the only
[2:56:05] way
[2:56:06] was to break the leg
[2:56:10] and it would heal but perhaps not in the
[2:56:13] same way and the Sheep would never
[2:56:16] forget
[2:56:17] it but never stray again Lord if that
[2:56:20] has ever been a case in my life and I
[2:56:23] hold
[2:56:24] resentment instead of Honor I want you
[2:56:26] to heal me now I want you to show me
[2:56:29] that place I want you to pour oil on
[2:56:32] that place that wound and I want to be
[2:56:35] able to believe that you have my best
[2:56:37] interest as someone said I think it
