[1:13:24] the cross
[1:13:27] you and i
[1:13:29] were on
[1:13:31] his mind
[1:13:33] so
[1:13:34] unworthy
[1:13:38] [Music]
[1:13:40] of such
[1:13:42] mercy
[1:13:45] [Music]
[1:13:48] yet when he
[1:13:50] was on
[1:13:52] the cross
[1:13:55] you and i
[1:13:58] were all
[1:14:00] his mind
[1:14:03] [Music]
[1:14:06] let's give him a little praise for that
[1:14:08] thank you
[1:14:10] yes
[1:14:12] yes
[1:14:14] thank you all
[1:14:16] yes
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:21] hallelujah
[1:14:23] isn't he wonderful
[1:14:25] oh he is so wonderful
[1:14:29] praise god
[1:14:31] you know this has been an unusual week
[1:14:34] for a lot of you
[1:14:36] and it's been a sad time
[1:14:39] in the losing of our neighbor
[1:14:41] our brother
[1:14:42] who was with us
[1:14:44] i knew him for 30 years
[1:14:47] and i knew him well
[1:14:49] and i'm so glad for the promise
[1:14:52] that i will see him again
[1:14:55] you don't have to go to church together
[1:14:57] to have a home together
[1:15:00] i believe that
[1:15:01] and i have no doubt in my mind
[1:15:04] that we will meet again one of these
[1:15:06] days
[1:15:07] god takes care of those things with his
[1:15:10] precious blood
[1:15:11] we pray for the family
[1:15:13] monday i was not planning to come in
[1:15:16] here
[1:15:18] i had some things i wanted to do
[1:15:20] that didn't
[1:15:22] have to do with the office
[1:15:24] and yet i got a phone call pretty early
[1:15:27] or was it monday or tuesday it might
[1:15:29] have been tuesday morning
[1:15:31] but i got a phone call pretty early from
[1:15:33] brother rj and he said someone has
[1:15:36] thrown a brick through the window which
[1:15:38] we've never had anything like that
[1:15:39] happen
[1:15:40] the last time we had real vandalism
[1:15:44] was in about 1990
[1:15:48] uh must have been about november of 1990
[1:15:51] when i
[1:15:52] turned at cooper creek road on a sunday
[1:15:54] morning and someone had vandalized the
[1:15:57] sign
[1:15:58] someone who couldn't spell
[1:16:01] had vandalized the sign
[1:16:03] it always said new hope revival center
[1:16:07] and now it said new hope brandon might
[1:16:11] center
[1:16:15] seems a little strange these days when
[1:16:18] there's so much talk about somebody
[1:16:19] named brandon
[1:16:23] but he was meaning to say branamide and
[1:16:26] i wasn't a brand of mites center then
[1:16:28] and i'm not a brand of mite center today
[1:16:32] because he wouldn't appreciate that very
[1:16:34] much
[1:16:35] but that was the vandalism so it was a
[1:16:38] shock that someone was able to walk
[1:16:41] right on to the campground
[1:16:43] and be able to do that but you know
[1:16:45] everybody just went to work as i
[1:16:47] mentioned
[1:16:48] on tuesday night and they got the window
[1:16:51] that had been boxed in in the studio and
[1:16:54] uh changed out the frame and brother
[1:16:56] greeley came and picked up the old frame
[1:16:58] to get new glass put in it and
[1:17:01] and it was a little bit hard to deal
[1:17:03] with emotionally but we got through it
[1:17:06] by the grace of god sister jennifer came
[1:17:09] over here quickly and there was glass
[1:17:11] everywhere and i i couldn't figure out
[1:17:13] why there was so much glass with one
[1:17:15] little hole and then it dawned on me it
[1:17:17] was two panes it had to go through two
[1:17:19] thicknesses of glass
[1:17:21] and we had to change out the pew because
[1:17:23] there were so many slivers of glass
[1:17:25] in the pew that we didn't know how much
[1:17:27] we were getting if we were getting it
[1:17:29] all or not getting it but you know it
[1:17:31] happened so quickly
[1:17:32] and then there were other things that
[1:17:34] came along in the week i'm sure for you
[1:17:38] it was the one year anniversary of my
[1:17:40] father's passing which i couldn't help
[1:17:42] but mark and will always mark in my mind
[1:17:45] and we'll of course think about the
[1:17:47] things that we wish could have been
[1:17:50] but all of that in one week's time has
[1:17:53] made it a wonderful
[1:17:56] glorious week because we've had to
[1:17:59] depend on the lord
[1:18:01] and hasn't he been good to us
[1:18:04] so faithful
[1:18:06] so good
[1:18:08] and uh i just rejoiced yesterday i
[1:18:11] didn't i didn't go to the baby shower
[1:18:13] but i i rejoiced that it was going on it
[1:18:16] made me feel so good
[1:18:18] for nathan and shoshanna that god was
[1:18:21] giving them a baby and
[1:18:23] their the what they have lost will never
[1:18:25] be replaced but it's the grace of god to
[1:18:28] remember us
[1:18:30] and he's giving them a beautiful healthy
[1:18:33] baby and then it's been nearly a month
[1:18:35] since i had seen elizabeth and
[1:18:38] and
[1:18:41] she came in my office and i knew exactly
[1:18:43] what her condition was i could tell
[1:18:46] right away
[1:18:47] that she had certainly in that month of
[1:18:49] being away she had blossomed and
[1:18:53] which reminds us of another beautiful
[1:18:55] baby that's coming and
[1:18:57] and i got to go to bed last night just
[1:18:59] before going to bed i got to have a
[1:19:01] little ezekiel time for the first time
[1:19:03] in i guess four weeks five weeks six
[1:19:06] weeks something like that and that was a
[1:19:08] real blessing too
[1:19:09] we've had good fellowship with saints
[1:19:11] i've had phone calls from all over
[1:19:14] the country you might say and hearing
[1:19:16] from people that god is stirring them
[1:19:18] and i tell you it's just a wonderful
[1:19:20] time to be serving the lord
[1:19:23] and i'm glad that you and i have an
[1:19:25] opportunity to serve him together
[1:19:28] and i'm not in a hurry and if you are
[1:19:31] you just understand with all the
[1:19:33] kindness that i can muster that the door
[1:19:35] swings to let you in and it'll swing to
[1:19:38] let you out if you should need to leave
[1:19:39] before we're ready to go
[1:19:41] but we're here for a purpose
[1:19:44] and that is to see what god has for us
[1:19:47] i'm going to be speaking today from the
[1:19:49] book of hebrews
[1:19:51] but before i go there i want to share
[1:19:53] with you two little things
[1:19:55] that i didn't get to share on tuesday
[1:19:57] night
[1:19:58] and in order to do that i've got to take
[1:20:00] you to an older text and that is in
[1:20:02] ephesians chapter 5 we read this tuesday
[1:20:06] night
[1:20:06] and i didn't let them know up there but
[1:20:09] they'll forgive me i hope
[1:20:11] ephesians chapter 5 verses 28 through 32
[1:20:15] there's a lot of talk of marriage going
[1:20:17] on with two
[1:20:19] engaged couples around here
[1:20:21] and it reminds us that what we know as
[1:20:25] marriage in the natural is
[1:20:27] really a symbol
[1:20:30] of a greater union
[1:20:32] it is a spiritual union that that is
[1:20:35] christ and his bride
[1:20:38] and uh i don't know how often you listen
[1:20:41] to the oneness message
[1:20:43] but a lot of people listen to it by
[1:20:45] mistake
[1:20:47] because they think they're going to hear
[1:20:49] a message of the oneness of the godhead
[1:20:52] but the message of oneness that brother
[1:20:54] branham preached is not just about the
[1:20:56] godhead
[1:20:58] it's about coming together in a oneness
[1:21:01] and in a union and in a a spiritual
[1:21:04] drawing
[1:21:06] i don't know if you know this or not but
[1:21:07] there's a spiritual drawing taking place
[1:21:11] and before i forget this let me tell you
[1:21:13] that that uh sister minkow is in
[1:21:18] labor and has been for a couple nights
[1:21:20] now and they are still waiting i just
[1:21:23] sent a text before i came up here to ask
[1:21:25] and they are still waiting so we're
[1:21:27] asking the lord to be merciful and good
[1:21:30] to her and help her to have a very
[1:21:32] healthy baby and a great delivery in the
[1:21:35] name of the lord amen but there's a real
[1:21:38] drawing taking place
[1:21:40] and
[1:21:41] somebody said to me this week who was
[1:21:43] trying to describe it was that the
[1:21:46] water's rising
[1:21:48] and when the water rises and it has here
[1:21:50] this week
[1:21:52] and and when the water rises it just
[1:21:54] raises everything up to a higher level
[1:21:57] and the fences that used to keep us on
[1:21:59] one side or the other they they don't
[1:22:01] get to hold us back anymore
[1:22:04] all the ducks just float together isn't
[1:22:07] that the goodness of god to do that for
[1:22:09] us
[1:22:09] because you know it's very possible to
[1:22:12] be called out of a denomination and
[1:22:15] become one
[1:22:18] to form another
[1:22:20] we know the message didn't come to do
[1:22:22] anything like that but god's just
[1:22:24] drawing people together
[1:22:26] and giving us a chance to love one
[1:22:29] another and there's a stirring taking
[1:22:31] place
[1:22:32] and we're thankful for that verse 28 so
[1:22:35] ought men to love their wives
[1:22:38] as their own bodies
[1:22:41] that's powerful
[1:22:43] it's a deep love that a man has for his
[1:22:45] own body
[1:22:46] that he wants to take care of his own
[1:22:49] form
[1:22:50] it's not just the woman brother branham
[1:22:52] said it's in the heart of a woman to
[1:22:53] want to be beautiful but but a man he's
[1:22:56] concerned about his health he should be
[1:22:59] and uh he loves to take care of himself
[1:23:01] with an extra bowl of ice cream
[1:23:04] and pamper himself a little bit so ought
[1:23:07] men to love their wives as their own
[1:23:10] bodies he that loveth his wife loveth
[1:23:13] himself because she of course is a part
[1:23:16] of he
[1:23:17] for no man
[1:23:19] ever hated ever yet hated his own flesh
[1:23:23] but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as
[1:23:26] the lord the church
[1:23:28] for we are members
[1:23:31] of his body
[1:23:33] of his flesh
[1:23:35] and of his bones do you believe that
[1:23:39] flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone
[1:23:42] i heard brother branham say this week
[1:23:44] the word is becoming flesh the flesh is
[1:23:47] becoming word the word is becoming word
[1:23:50] that's a pretty big statement and i'm
[1:23:52] thankful to be a part of that word
[1:23:54] becoming word
[1:23:56] word becoming flesh flesh changed to
[1:23:59] word
[1:24:00] they too shall be one flesh this is a
[1:24:03] great mystery
[1:24:06] but i speak concerning christ and
[1:24:09] the church
[1:24:11] you may be seated may god add his
[1:24:13] blessing to the reading of his word lord
[1:24:16] we need you this morning
[1:24:19] i wanted to share with you if you'll
[1:24:21] give me some time and your patience
[1:24:24] i wanted to share two quotations
[1:24:27] because we were talking about
[1:24:29] sort of part two
[1:24:31] of the unshakable unmovable kingdom
[1:24:35] and we were specifically talking about
[1:24:38] the references that brother branham made
[1:24:40] about the messianic
[1:24:45] the messiah and the little messiahs
[1:24:49] and those little messiahs make up a
[1:24:51] messianic kingdom
[1:24:53] and it is a mystical body
[1:24:56] and this is what the scripture said here
[1:24:59] in verse 32 this is a great mystery
[1:25:02] and it means that it is a it has a
[1:25:05] mystical
[1:25:06] approach there's a level of mysticism or
[1:25:10] mystery that surrounds the relationship
[1:25:14] between christ and his church
[1:25:17] but i love these two places and i i was
[1:25:20] so afraid in my mind that i would forget
[1:25:23] to come back and share them at a later
[1:25:25] time so i don't have to i can do it this
[1:25:28] morning and i can have two or three
[1:25:30] themes going all at one time in that
[1:25:32] rite
[1:25:33] in the message the supernatural
[1:25:36] from owensboro kentucky it's in today's
[1:25:39] document there first quotation paragraph
[1:25:42] 23
[1:25:44] the supernatural and that's the reason
[1:25:48] sometimes a divine life
[1:25:52] that's been called and set aside has
[1:25:56] become a fanatic
[1:26:01] you ever known any
[1:26:04] or crazy
[1:26:08] or a mystic
[1:26:10] or something to the eyes of the general
[1:26:13] public
[1:26:14] it's because you're considered uh uh
[1:26:18] uh
[1:26:21] i'd say a neurotic
[1:26:24] i want you to listen at the prophet
[1:26:27] i'd say a neurotic
[1:26:30] you may not have ever been called a
[1:26:32] neurotic to your face
[1:26:34] but you may have
[1:26:36] you may have been called one behind your
[1:26:38] back
[1:26:39] and somebody's probably called you a
[1:26:41] fanatic in your own home
[1:26:45] somebody in your own family has probably
[1:26:48] called you crazy
[1:26:52] psycho
[1:26:55] to the eyes of the general public i i
[1:26:58] doubt anybody i know has ever called me
[1:27:00] a mystic
[1:27:01] but they probably call me all these
[1:27:03] other things brother branham say i'd say
[1:27:05] a neurotic or an or an insane person
[1:27:10] he must have lost his mind she's gone
[1:27:13] totally crazy
[1:27:15] insanity has set in
[1:27:18] it's because you have changed your
[1:27:22] oh
[1:27:25] you have changed your dwelling place
[1:27:32] they call you a fanatic for christ
[1:27:35] because you are no longer caught up in
[1:27:37] the atmosphere of planet earth
[1:27:42] what moves the general population oh
[1:27:46] thank god
[1:27:48] what moves the general population
[1:27:51] doesn't move you
[1:27:53] it doesn't cause you to be shaken or
[1:27:56] moved or troubled or disturbed
[1:28:00] because you're living in another realm
[1:28:03] you're living in another spiritual
[1:28:05] atmosphere he said it's because you have
[1:28:08] changed your dwelling place and got into
[1:28:12] a different atmosphere
[1:28:17] your attitude will determine
[1:28:20] your atmosphere
[1:28:23] you're with me
[1:28:25] i know that's right
[1:28:26] you don't have to amen
[1:28:29] but the attitude you have toward what
[1:28:31] has been made available in christ
[1:28:34] will certainly affect and even create
[1:28:39] an atmosphere and it will be a different
[1:28:41] atmosphere
[1:28:43] than those around you
[1:28:45] can you say amen
[1:28:46] let's read on just a minute because i i
[1:28:49] got a lot to cover and i'm getting too
[1:28:51] excited inside over this
[1:28:53] and your one motive
[1:28:58] i want you to listen at the importance
[1:29:00] of dwelling in the right atmosphere
[1:29:03] he said your one motive
[1:29:06] your one thought
[1:29:09] is to stay in that atmosphere
[1:29:13] more than a new raiment more than
[1:29:16] clothes more than food
[1:29:18] you see he's got the lilies
[1:29:21] and he's got you
[1:29:23] he knows how to feed the sparrow he
[1:29:26] knows how to feed you
[1:29:27] is that right so we can't get caught up
[1:29:31] in the pressures of of of bills
[1:29:36] and in the pressures of keeping up with
[1:29:38] the joneses
[1:29:40] until we allow it to move us out of the
[1:29:43] atmosphere of christ and into an
[1:29:46] atmosphere that's just like the general
[1:29:47] population walking around i'm going to
[1:29:50] tell you something the bride of christ
[1:29:53] we live in a higher dimension a higher
[1:29:55] realm a higher atmosphere than citizens
[1:29:58] of the united states of america we've
[1:30:01] got a higher place we dwell in a higher
[1:30:04] place we live here in the world but
[1:30:06] we're not of this atmosphere
[1:30:09] and as soon as we start reaching out to
[1:30:12] feed ourselves on the atmosphere of
[1:30:15] planet earth we become worldly
[1:30:18] we become carnal minded
[1:30:21] we begin to get in the rat race and the
[1:30:24] dog fight of the world around us
[1:30:27] and we begin to step on people as we
[1:30:30] climb the corporate ladder we live in a
[1:30:34] different atmosphere and we miss out on
[1:30:36] what god has promised to us
[1:30:38] by living in the atmosphere of christ
[1:30:41] brother branham is stressing here by
[1:30:43] saying you're one motive
[1:30:46] you're one motive
[1:30:48] your one thought
[1:30:50] is to stay in that atmosphere
[1:30:54] don't be moved when people call you
[1:30:56] crazy
[1:30:57] don't be called when moved when people
[1:31:00] call you neurotic
[1:31:03] or a weirdo
[1:31:05] or a stranger
[1:31:07] or a fanatic
[1:31:09] hallelujah
[1:31:11] and i'll tell you this if you're not
[1:31:13] living close enough to him to get some
[1:31:16] of those accusations you're not living
[1:31:17] close enough to him
[1:31:19] because the closer you get to him the
[1:31:21] more misunderstood you're going to be in
[1:31:23] the world around you
[1:31:25] and that means there's going to be other
[1:31:26] parts of the body that won't even
[1:31:28] understand you because they're not
[1:31:30] running after the same atmosphere that
[1:31:32] you're running after they have not
[1:31:34] recognized yet that our one motive
[1:31:37] [Music]
[1:31:38] and our one thought
[1:31:40] should be to stay in that atmosphere the
[1:31:43] atmosphere of christ
[1:31:45] any person that ever come into that
[1:31:47] atmosphere one time
[1:31:56] just put them in that place where heaven
[1:31:58] comes down
[1:32:00] and touches the earth
[1:32:02] get them in the smack
[1:32:04] where heaven comes down and kisses the
[1:32:06] earth
[1:32:07] let them get in the atmosphere of the
[1:32:09] other world and i want you to know
[1:32:11] they'll never be satisfied in the
[1:32:14] atmosphere of of the general population
[1:32:17] or of the earth and world and society
[1:32:20] and secular life around us you'll keep
[1:32:23] coming back and coming back and coming
[1:32:25] back you know i know that we take the
[1:32:28] scripture jesus at the well with the
[1:32:30] woman and we say that and we kind of
[1:32:33] base the effect on that once you've
[1:32:35] tasted this well you'll never thirst
[1:32:37] again well i want you to know there's no
[1:32:39] water on the planet like that
[1:32:42] there's not even a spiritual water like
[1:32:44] that
[1:32:46] somebody said what do you mean isn't
[1:32:47] that what jesus said yes he said that
[1:32:49] because he knew that once she tasted
[1:32:52] that water
[1:32:54] all of her desires would change
[1:32:57] and there would be nothing else for her
[1:33:00] but that water
[1:33:02] it becomes an exclusive fountain to you
[1:33:05] once you have tasted of that living
[1:33:08] water you'll never thirst again for
[1:33:10] average water
[1:33:12] the sunny will never do it and callaway
[1:33:14] blue will never do it and the waters of
[1:33:17] this life will never do it
[1:33:19] not even good family fellowship will do
[1:33:21] it
[1:33:22] nothing
[1:33:23] will take the place of that living water
[1:33:27] and that atmosphere of being in christ
[1:33:29] any person that's ever come into that
[1:33:31] atmosphere one time will never be
[1:33:34] satisfied nowhere else
[1:33:36] he said and that's
[1:33:38] what i believe
[1:33:40] that we should have our churches
[1:33:45] under control
[1:33:47] [Music]
[1:33:50] by the church order sermon
[1:33:54] i'm just telling you what he said
[1:33:56] that's why i believe that we should have
[1:33:59] our churches under control
[1:34:01] by the holy ghost
[1:34:05] now that very life of god should be able
[1:34:09] to keep the church of god in order
[1:34:13] under the control
[1:34:16] of the holy ghost
[1:34:18] that's the atmosphere i'm looking for
[1:34:21] so what if you sing one song for 20
[1:34:23] minutes
[1:34:25] so what if you sing five songs instead
[1:34:28] of three
[1:34:30] so what if you come back at the end of
[1:34:31] the service and sing the same song
[1:34:33] you're saying at the beginning sing it
[1:34:35] another 20 minutes as long as we're
[1:34:39] under the control
[1:34:41] of the holy ghost and living in the
[1:34:44] atmosphere of christ
[1:34:48] nothing else can matter
[1:34:50] and i want you to know the more you
[1:34:52] purpose
[1:34:54] the more you have intention
[1:34:56] and the more your motive is to remain in
[1:34:59] the atmosphere of christ the less of
[1:35:02] this world
[1:35:04] will be able to trouble you
[1:35:06] it's so quick that we can bounce back to
[1:35:09] joy
[1:35:10] when we know that that's our inheritance
[1:35:13] the joy of the lord
[1:35:15] the joy of the lord
[1:35:17] the joy of the lord i want to hear
[1:35:19] somebody say the joy of the lord
[1:35:21] i'm holding myself because i have got a
[1:35:24] lot to unload and and i know my time is
[1:35:27] getting away from me very very fast so i
[1:35:29] don't know how how many parts this these
[1:35:31] 17 pages will end up being but all i
[1:35:34] know is i couldn't stop them from coming
[1:35:36] in fact i have about five or six titles
[1:35:39] to this sermon this morning i couldn't
[1:35:41] choose one
[1:35:43] so they're all i just named it all it's
[1:35:45] got six five or six titles here
[1:35:48] and then as i was sitting on the
[1:35:49] platform i had i had three or four more
[1:35:51] come to my mind
[1:35:53] but before i get there let me read the
[1:35:55] last quote from from the message tuesday
[1:35:58] night
[1:35:59] and this is just a short sentence
[1:36:02] a couple of sentences or a sentence and
[1:36:04] a fragment from the message the 70th
[1:36:06] week of daniel
[1:36:08] 1961
[1:36:10] and it says the bride
[1:36:13] is
[1:36:14] that
[1:36:14] mystic
[1:36:16] body
[1:36:17] it is in the bride that the mystery of
[1:36:21] christ and his church is revealed
[1:36:25] it's not in denominational christianity
[1:36:28] it's not in the churches who are the
[1:36:30] daughters of the great
[1:36:33] come on now
[1:36:34] looking more and more like their mother
[1:36:36] every day
[1:36:37] i just mentioned this to you the other
[1:36:39] day
[1:36:40] some someone was here who had graduated
[1:36:43] and i was in a class in nazarene college
[1:36:48] and they were being told that you must
[1:36:51] understand and stand on the apostles
[1:36:54] creed
[1:36:58] and the person said the apostles creed
[1:37:00] is for the roman catholic church
[1:37:03] sister jeffrey ought to remember about
[1:37:05] the apostles creed
[1:37:08] because she and i were in court one time
[1:37:11] we were testifying of what we knew
[1:37:14] and they were bringing some accusation
[1:37:17] against her
[1:37:18] and by default against me
[1:37:22] and the accusation was you don't even
[1:37:24] know the apostles creed
[1:37:28] and our answer was not only do we not
[1:37:30] know how to recite it we don't follow it
[1:37:36] and i wish you could have heard the
[1:37:38] judge
[1:37:40] because the judge said to the attorney i
[1:37:42] don't know where you're going with that
[1:37:46] he said because i think he said it like
[1:37:48] this because you're a methodist but i'm
[1:37:50] baptist
[1:37:52] this is the judge
[1:37:54] and he said you methodists follow the
[1:37:56] the apostles creed because of the
[1:37:58] catholic church
[1:38:00] but we don't
[1:38:02] so move on
[1:38:07] move on
[1:38:09] he was going to try to make it some
[1:38:10] strange thing
[1:38:13] that there's an orthodox christian that
[1:38:15] doesn't believe in the apostles creed
[1:38:18] and so this this sister in the class she
[1:38:20] spoke up she said well that's part of
[1:38:22] the roman catholic church and and said i
[1:38:25] thought i thought this was a protestant
[1:38:27] college and they said we're not
[1:38:30] protesting anything
[1:38:37] no they're not protesting anything
[1:38:40] because they have swallowed her fallacy
[1:38:44] they've swallowed her error
[1:38:46] they've been seduced by her
[1:38:49] come on her drunkenness has compelled to
[1:38:52] them and they're also drunk with the
[1:38:54] same wine that she is drunk with
[1:38:57] but there is a bride and that bride is
[1:39:01] the true ecclesia the true called out
[1:39:05] and she is the mystic body the
[1:39:08] mysterious body of christ by the holy
[1:39:12] spirit sorry to the upc not baptizing
[1:39:16] jesus name into the body
[1:39:20] i love baptism in the name of jesus it's
[1:39:22] the only christian baptism i know
[1:39:24] anything about
[1:39:26] but i don't believe that's our entrance
[1:39:29] it's by the holy spirit that we are
[1:39:32] baptized into the mystical body of
[1:39:34] christ hallelujah how did you know
[1:39:37] you're part of the bride the holy spirit
[1:39:40] told you so
[1:39:42] the holy ghost revealed to you who you
[1:39:44] were
[1:39:45] hallelujah
[1:39:47] and you know some of us didn't have to
[1:39:49] come out
[1:39:50] because when the holy ghost revealed to
[1:39:53] us who we were we couldn't keep it to
[1:39:55] ourselves
[1:39:56] and so instead of having to come out
[1:40:02] we got the right buddha fellowship
[1:40:06] we don't want those troublemakers around
[1:40:08] here i'd rather know that i've been
[1:40:11] baptized by the holy spirit into the
[1:40:14] mystic body of christ living in the
[1:40:17] atmosphere of christ
[1:40:19] than to fit in fit in in this whole
[1:40:23] world
[1:40:24] if you're not a square peg they're
[1:40:26] trying to pound into a round hole
[1:40:28] something is wrong with you
[1:40:31] i don't want to get adjusted
[1:40:33] to this world
[1:40:35] amen could i do something out of the out
[1:40:37] of the ordinary would you stand again
[1:40:40] hebrews chapter 12
[1:40:42] i'm doing this for your sake
[1:40:45] to let you stretch a little bit
[1:40:50] i want to say to that brother in the uk
[1:40:53] that we were not able to do your song
[1:40:55] request this morning
[1:40:57] i absolutely let it slip my mind but we
[1:40:59] will get it and you'll catch it in the
[1:41:01] archive
[1:41:02] and god bless you brother for writing
[1:41:05] from the uk last night and asking us to
[1:41:07] do the song adonai
[1:41:09] but we just didn't get that in this
[1:41:11] morning but we will and it blessed me
[1:41:15] because it reminds you that someone is
[1:41:17] out there on the other end
[1:41:21] we appreciate them
[1:41:23] hebrews chapter 12 beginning in verse 1
[1:41:26] lord help me read it and not preach it
[1:41:28] as we go
[1:41:30] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[1:41:35] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[1:41:38] let us lay aside
[1:41:41] every weight
[1:41:44] let's say every weight
[1:41:47] and the sin let's say that too
[1:41:50] which doth so easily
[1:41:53] beset us
[1:41:55] and let us run
[1:41:58] with patience
[1:42:01] with patience
[1:42:03] the race
[1:42:05] that is set before us
[1:42:07] without preaching may i just add your
[1:42:09] race
[1:42:10] and my race
[1:42:12] may not look the same
[1:42:14] but the goal line
[1:42:16] the finish line
[1:42:18] of my race and your race is exactly the
[1:42:21] same don't you become a race comparer
[1:42:25] don't you examine somebody else's
[1:42:27] racetrack
[1:42:29] get your eyes on your own racetrack
[1:42:33] looking unto jesus verse 2
[1:42:36] looking unto jesus
[1:42:39] looking unto jesus
[1:42:43] i was so blessed by
[1:42:45] arrive alive
[1:42:47] brother greeley
[1:42:49] i haven't made it through the second one
[1:42:50] yet but i know i'll be greatly blessed
[1:42:54] and someone said something i think in
[1:42:56] one of the services
[1:42:57] about that great message looking away to
[1:43:00] jesus
[1:43:02] here it is
[1:43:04] looking
[1:43:05] unto jesus
[1:43:06] the author and
[1:43:08] finisher of our faith
[1:43:11] the origin and the completion
[1:43:14] of our faith who for the joy
[1:43:17] who for the joy
[1:43:19] joy say it with me
[1:43:22] joy
[1:43:25] for the joy that was set before him
[1:43:30] endured the cross
[1:43:33] despising the shame
[1:43:35] and is set down at the right hand of
[1:43:40] the throne of god
[1:43:43] isn't that what it says in your bible
[1:43:45] for consider him that endured such
[1:43:48] contradiction of sinners against himself
[1:43:51] lest ye be wearied
[1:43:53] and faint
[1:43:55] in your minds
[1:43:58] ye have not yet resisted unto blood
[1:44:02] striving against sin
[1:44:05] in all of our suffering and all of our
[1:44:07] resisting and all of our struggles and
[1:44:10] all of our trials we have not yet
[1:44:12] resisted unto blood so we have to keep
[1:44:14] our minds from getting too weary we have
[1:44:17] to keep our minds from fainting
[1:44:20] your mind faints the rest of you is
[1:44:22] going to follow
[1:44:24] you're going to be spiritually in coma
[1:44:26] if you let your mind faint don't do it
[1:44:29] keep it awake keep it alive and ye have
[1:44:31] forgotten the exhortation which speaketh
[1:44:33] unto you as unto children my son despise
[1:44:37] not the chastening of the lord nor faint
[1:44:40] when thou art rebuked of him
[1:44:43] for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth
[1:44:45] and scourgeth every son
[1:44:48] whom he receiveth i want to be a
[1:44:51] received son
[1:44:53] for if ye endure chastening god dealeth
[1:44:58] with you
[1:44:59] as
[1:45:00] sons for what son is he whom the father
[1:45:06] chasteneth not may god add his blessing
[1:45:08] to the reading of his word you may take
[1:45:10] your seat now i want you to be able to
[1:45:12] concentrate on the rest of these verses
[1:45:16] but if ye be without chastisement
[1:45:19] whereof all are partakers
[1:45:23] then are ye bastards
[1:45:25] and not sons
[1:45:28] we know it means illegitimate children
[1:45:31] children born
[1:45:33] outside the covenant
[1:45:36] the wedlock the commitment of marriage
[1:45:39] if you are without chastisement where
[1:45:42] everybody around you has to partake then
[1:45:45] you are illegitimate your bastards in
[1:45:48] the sight of god and not
[1:45:50] really sons
[1:45:52] pretty serious
[1:45:54] got my attention
[1:45:56] hope it can always have yours
[1:45:58] next verse furthermore we have had
[1:46:00] fathers of our flesh which corrected us
[1:46:04] and we gave them reverence
[1:46:07] shall we not much rather be in
[1:46:09] subjection unto the father of spirits
[1:46:12] and live
[1:46:14] it's important to understand our
[1:46:16] relationship with our abba with our papa
[1:46:20] next verse for they verily for a few
[1:46:23] days chastened us after their own
[1:46:26] pleasure
[1:46:27] but he for our prophet
[1:46:30] that we might be partakers
[1:46:33] of his holiness
[1:46:36] i just had a flashback
[1:46:38] perhaps you can have flashbacks
[1:46:41] when you think of being corrected
[1:46:44] my mother corrected me like a father
[1:46:49] enough for a father but i remember
[1:46:52] two times in my life of five years with
[1:46:55] my dad that's all i had
[1:46:58] i remember two times
[1:47:00] of being disciplined
[1:47:02] one
[1:47:03] it was averted
[1:47:06] but he had every intention
[1:47:08] of giving me what he thought i deserved
[1:47:12] and i just flashed back as i read that
[1:47:14] verse of scripture because it's true
[1:47:17] our dads only have so much time
[1:47:21] i'm thankful that i don't yet have a
[1:47:23] child that i can't discipline
[1:47:28] i have four they all live in my home
[1:47:30] they're all subject to the belt
[1:47:35] even to this day
[1:47:37] if they so need it it will be provided
[1:47:41] because my time with them is limited
[1:47:45] and getting more limited as
[1:47:47] as june is drawing nigh
[1:47:51] if i have another way of getting to it
[1:47:53] i'm going to try that
[1:47:55] but if it doesn't work i have a
[1:47:57] responsibility boy got quiet
[1:48:01] i have
[1:48:02] responsibility yes we do
[1:48:05] we only have a short time i'm so
[1:48:07] thankful so very thankful that when a
[1:48:10] father's
[1:48:12] ability to chasten his children expires
[1:48:15] i'm glad that our heavenly father has no
[1:48:18] expiration we never get too big
[1:48:21] [Music]
[1:48:23] we never get too big too smart too
[1:48:26] haughty
[1:48:29] we never think too much of ourselves
[1:48:32] that he doesn't know how to bring us
[1:48:34] down
[1:48:35] not because he wants to see a squirm
[1:48:39] but he wants to see us glorified
[1:48:44] he's got a motivation of joy
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:48] he's still being motivated by joy
[1:48:52] and i want you to know joy
[1:48:55] is costly
[1:48:58] there's a price to be paid
[1:49:01] one of the titles of these next few
[1:49:04] messages would be
[1:49:05] the high cost of joy
[1:49:09] it's expensive
[1:49:10] to find joy
[1:49:12] it's worth it
[1:49:14] it was worth it for him
[1:49:17] it's worth it for me
[1:49:19] you see the truth is i am
[1:49:22] his joy
[1:49:24] and i was expensive
[1:49:28] and the truth is he is my joy
[1:49:33] and he's expensive
[1:49:35] somebody said what price did you pay the
[1:49:38] biggest price
[1:49:39] that a human can possibly pay and that
[1:49:42] is to say yes
[1:49:46] and if you did it automatically you may
[1:49:48] not be born again
[1:49:50] but if you did it with some
[1:49:51] contemplation you better know when you
[1:49:54] say yes to him you're in this for the
[1:49:56] long haul
[1:49:58] because he don't let you off the hook
[1:50:00] there's no discharge from the army of
[1:50:02] the lord
[1:50:03] you can't resign and and try on
[1:50:06] something else when you get ready once
[1:50:08] god has given you a revelation of who
[1:50:10] you are in christ you can't change your
[1:50:13] place by changing your church
[1:50:17] you can't change who you are by changing
[1:50:19] your doctrine
[1:50:22] no no no no no
[1:50:24] there's something bigger than that
[1:50:27] we are his joy he becomes our joy he
[1:50:30] becomes our joy because we were first
[1:50:32] his joy
[1:50:34] it was us it was you that caused him to
[1:50:37] be able to endure the suffering of the
[1:50:40] cross despising the shame yet going all
[1:50:45] the way because he saw you he had you in
[1:50:48] his heart he had you in his mind
[1:50:52] is anybody with me
[1:50:54] all right let's go on for they verily
[1:50:56] for a few days chastened us after their
[1:50:58] own pleasure but he for our prophet that
[1:51:01] we might be partakers of what
[1:51:04] his holiness
[1:51:07] that's the holiness that we're running
[1:51:09] after in this hour
[1:51:11] anything we do and call it holiness is
[1:51:14] our desire to remain covered by his
[1:51:20] but our holiness is never enough
[1:51:23] amen we just want to try to reflect his
[1:51:26] holiness by the choices that we make
[1:51:30] amen
[1:51:32] by the things we associate and identify
[1:51:35] ourselves with
[1:51:36] and the scripture goes on
[1:51:38] for note now no chastening for the
[1:51:40] present seemeth to be joyous
[1:51:43] but grievous
[1:51:45] nevertheless afterward it yielded the
[1:51:47] peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[1:51:49] them which are exercised thereby
[1:51:53] and then he goes on
[1:51:55] wherefore lift up the hands
[1:51:58] which hang down and the feeble knees
[1:52:00] have a little mercy
[1:52:04] for the legitimate sons
[1:52:09] have a little mercy have a little
[1:52:10] compassion for those that you see god
[1:52:13] dealing with
[1:52:15] lift up hands
[1:52:17] the greatest thing you can do for
[1:52:18] anybody is pray
[1:52:21] and pray without prejudice
[1:52:23] pray without judgment
[1:52:25] pray without manipulation in witchcraft
[1:52:28] you know how do i do that brother you
[1:52:30] just pray like jesus said pray
[1:52:35] on earth
[1:52:37] on earth
[1:52:39] as it is in heaven wherefore lift up
[1:52:41] hands which hang down and the feeble
[1:52:43] knees
[1:52:45] strengthen them thank god for that and
[1:52:47] make straight paths for your feet get
[1:52:50] off that crooked journey of up and down
[1:52:53] and all around
[1:52:57] lest that which is lame be turned out of
[1:52:59] the way
[1:53:00] but let it rather be healed oh yes he's
[1:53:03] got all the healing you need in your
[1:53:05] feet he knows how to correct your walk
[1:53:07] and your gait he's got it
[1:53:09] follow peace with all men
[1:53:13] that means send it ahead
[1:53:16] and holiness
[1:53:18] without which no man shall see the lord
[1:53:23] no man
[1:53:25] shall see the lord let's read on looking
[1:53:27] diligently lest any man fail of the
[1:53:31] grace of god
[1:53:33] lest any root of bitterness springing up
[1:53:35] trouble you and thereby many be defiled
[1:53:39] many in this hour
[1:53:41] many in this hour
[1:53:44] are defiled by roots of bitterness
[1:53:47] that originated in human jealousy
[1:53:52] and the bride of jesus christ is not
[1:53:55] immune
[1:53:56] because we are human
[1:53:59] and because we are human the enemy seeks
[1:54:02] to come in the night
[1:54:04] and sow a seed
[1:54:06] of discord in our own lives
[1:54:09] we have to recognize it
[1:54:12] and get it out like brother branham said
[1:54:14] with the grub hole
[1:54:17] grub it out
[1:54:19] refuse to live by it
[1:54:22] because people around us choose to
[1:54:25] remain in their bitterness and it's a
[1:54:27] costly place to live
[1:54:30] thereby many be defiled just a little
[1:54:32] bit more
[1:54:34] lest there be any fornicator or profane
[1:54:37] person as esau who for one morsel of
[1:54:42] meat
[1:54:44] wow i gotta have a little water
[1:54:47] while we pause and remember these things
[1:54:50] for one morsel of meat sold his
[1:54:52] birthright
[1:54:57] i've walked with those on this journey
[1:55:00] who sold their birthright
[1:55:04] who would rather be right than be called
[1:55:07] and obedient to the call
[1:55:10] and anointed
[1:55:12] there's nothing in this world more
[1:55:14] valuable than his anointing on an
[1:55:16] obedient life
[1:55:18] that anointing can take you farther than
[1:55:20] you could ever go on your own
[1:55:22] the anointing of god on an obedient life
[1:55:25] can open doors that no man can open and
[1:55:27] shut doors that no man could shut
[1:55:31] that favor and anointing on the lord of
[1:55:34] the lord on the life of a believer is
[1:55:37] more valuable
[1:55:39] than any pot of porridge
[1:55:42] or any position
[1:55:44] yes it is
[1:55:46] esau for one morsel of meat sold his
[1:55:48] birthright for ye know how that
[1:55:51] afterward when he would have inherited
[1:55:53] the blessing
[1:55:55] he was rejected
[1:55:58] for he found no
[1:56:00] place of repentance
[1:56:04] though he sought it carefully
[1:56:08] with tears
[1:56:10] when someone is released from their
[1:56:13] spiritual covering
[1:56:16] their repentance is only necessary to
[1:56:20] god
[1:56:23] they have no other covering
[1:56:25] but god
[1:56:28] if they make peace with god
[1:56:31] their peace at peace
[1:56:33] now that doesn't mean that if time and
[1:56:36] circumstance will allow you don't ever
[1:56:38] want to go back and say i'm sorry when
[1:56:40] you need to say i'm sorry
[1:56:42] but please understand
[1:56:45] that when someone is removed from their
[1:56:48] spiritual covering all they have to do
[1:56:51] is seek god with repentance
[1:56:55] and when they do that
[1:56:57] what sins
[1:57:00] what rebellion
[1:57:02] what transgression
[1:57:04] are you talking about
[1:57:06] it's forgiven and forgotten
[1:57:08] forever
[1:57:10] never to be uh
[1:57:12] brought up
[1:57:13] never to be used as a weapon
[1:57:16] against that person again
[1:57:18] it's mercy it's mercy that releases
[1:57:22] someone into the hands of their creator
[1:57:25] that's mercy
[1:57:26] that's god's loving grace
[1:57:29] we release them into god's hands because
[1:57:32] nobody knows how to take care of his
[1:57:34] children
[1:57:37] like he does
[1:57:38] in the message
[1:57:40] turn on the light
[1:57:43] in paragraph 164 don't put that up just
[1:57:46] yet
[1:57:47] before you do i want to read hebrews 12
[1:57:50] 1 and 2
[1:57:52] in the amplified to set the scene for
[1:57:55] the rest of what we will share today
[1:57:58] and perhaps the next few services
[1:58:01] i read 17 verses because i could not
[1:58:05] find a place to stop
[1:58:08] i didn't like where i stopped
[1:58:13] i liked it it blessed me it talked to me
[1:58:17] it flowed into me as i read it and i
[1:58:20] didn't know where to stop but i finally
[1:58:22] stopped at 17 verses but i want to
[1:58:25] emphasize
[1:58:26] 12
[1:58:27] 1 and 2. i'm reading from the amplified
[1:58:30] and you see that little c there it means
[1:58:32] the classic edition of the amplified
[1:58:35] therefore then
[1:58:36] since we are surrounded by so great a
[1:58:39] cloud of witnesses
[1:58:42] we've just read
[1:58:43] hebrews 11.
[1:58:46] hebrews 11 we didn't read it but by the
[1:58:48] time we get to hebrews 12
[1:58:51] in our reading we would have finished
[1:58:53] hebrews 11 the hall of faith
[1:58:56] and we read about what each one of these
[1:58:59] generals that god chose to speak through
[1:59:03] paul to the hebrew church about we heard
[1:59:06] about their sacrifice
[1:59:09] and their faithfulness
[1:59:11] we found out that this old world is not
[1:59:14] even worthy of men and women like that
[1:59:17] who pay the price who fight the fight
[1:59:20] who finish the course who keep the faith
[1:59:24] they have hung in the hall of critics
[1:59:27] rightfully so
[1:59:29] because they were not perfect men
[1:59:32] go back and look at the list
[1:59:34] they were not perfect men but they were
[1:59:36] god's men
[1:59:39] so they hung in the hall of critics and
[1:59:41] now by the grace of god they hang in
[1:59:45] god's hall of faith
[1:59:46] and their faith is mentioned above all
[1:59:48] of their sins
[1:59:50] in fact abraham is given a new title
[1:59:55] he staggered not
[1:59:59] i don't understand it but god said it
[2:00:03] so i say amen
[2:00:06] he hung in the hall of critics he
[2:00:09] suffered along the way he made mistakes
[2:00:11] like everybody else but god said he's so
[2:00:15] pure in my sight
[2:00:18] he never staggered at my promise he held
[2:00:22] on believing i would always do what i
[2:00:24] said i was going to do he was just going
[2:00:25] to help me out a little
[2:00:28] bless his heart
[2:00:30] that's how i read it
[2:00:32] stagger not so now we know who the
[2:00:34] witnesses are
[2:00:36] and now in 2022 there are hundreds and
[2:00:39] thousands more
[2:00:41] who paid the price
[2:00:43] who kept the faith
[2:00:45] you didn't have to think of something
[2:00:46] good to say about them at their funeral
[2:00:50] their life
[2:00:52] was lived
[2:00:55] for christ
[2:00:56] and the fruit of their life
[2:00:59] was evident in their going away
[2:01:02] and all you had to do was get up and say
[2:01:04] who they really were and everyone could
[2:01:07] say amen in their hearts and go warm
[2:01:09] leave warm because they knew not perfect
[2:01:11] men
[2:01:14] but surrendered
[2:01:18] disciplined chastised
[2:01:20] legitimate children
[2:01:23] some of the suffering you knew about was
[2:01:25] because they really belonged to god
[2:01:28] they weren't adopted
[2:01:30] they were his first
[2:01:33] in fact twice mine
[2:01:35] he said
[2:01:36] he took them again created them and knew
[2:01:38] them before they were ever born and then
[2:01:40] found them in the window
[2:01:43] and purchased them with his own blood
[2:01:45] and bought them back again that's how
[2:01:47] much he loved them
[2:01:49] now so here we are in 12 1. therefore
[2:01:52] then since we are surrounded by so great
[2:01:55] a cloud of witnesses who have borne
[2:01:57] testimony to the truth let us strip off
[2:02:02] and throw aside
[2:02:04] every encumbrance are you awake
[2:02:08] unnecessary weight
[2:02:11] you don't want to get to the top of the
[2:02:14] hill
[2:02:16] overlooking the valley of ela
[2:02:19] and find out that you climbed all the
[2:02:22] way to the top
[2:02:24] with your rock with your pocket filled
[2:02:28] with rocks
[2:02:33] from this
[2:02:34] dry stream bed
[2:02:37] that david picked up his
[2:02:42] i got so excited about being at the
[2:02:45] valley of ela
[2:02:47] and looking down that dry creek bed
[2:02:50] where david had picked up his smooth
[2:02:52] rocks
[2:02:53] that i filled my pockets
[2:02:56] i had on cargo pants i filled all my
[2:02:59] pockets
[2:03:01] with the rocks and then somebody said
[2:03:03] let's go up here on the hill and look
[2:03:04] over the valley
[2:03:09] my was that harder
[2:03:14] i could have made it a lot easier
[2:03:16] if i would have emptied my pockets
[2:03:19] before i tried to climb how many of you
[2:03:21] got the message there it is
[2:03:24] let us throw aside every encumbrance
[2:03:26] unnecessary weight pile them at the
[2:03:29] bottom if you've got to have them
[2:03:31] they'll be there when you get back you
[2:03:34] don't want to climb the hill with rocks
[2:03:36] in your pocket
[2:03:39] and that sin which so readily deathly
[2:03:43] and cleverly clings to and entangles us
[2:03:48] and let us run with patient endurance
[2:03:53] and
[2:03:54] steady and active
[2:03:58] persistence
[2:04:00] the appointed course of the race
[2:04:02] that is set before us
[2:04:04] your race is not going to necessarily
[2:04:06] look like mine
[2:04:16] somebody may look at your life and
[2:04:18] wonder
[2:04:20] how lucky you were
[2:04:23] to be born with a silver spoon
[2:04:31] and they have no idea
[2:04:34] what you swallowed
[2:04:36] to get to where you are today
[2:04:38] because your race may not look like
[2:04:40] anybody else's race
[2:04:43] i want you to know you cannot have you
[2:04:45] seen that have you seen that uh picture
[2:04:49] of the pencil and the crayon
[2:04:51] there's a picture going around on social
[2:04:53] media and the pencil is comparing itself
[2:04:56] to the crayon and the crayon is
[2:04:58] comparing itself to the pencil and they
[2:05:00] both can leave a mark
[2:05:04] one's more colorful than the rest the
[2:05:06] other
[2:05:07] and because they're different
[2:05:09] instruments all together
[2:05:11] both able to leave a mark but because
[2:05:13] they're both instruments all together
[2:05:15] there is no comparison
[2:05:17] there are jobs that a pencil can do
[2:05:19] better
[2:05:20] than a crayon
[2:05:22] and there are jobs that a crayon can do
[2:05:25] better than a pencil they both leave a
[2:05:27] mark
[2:05:28] comparison is a dangerous
[2:05:32] habit to get in in this hour don't
[2:05:36] compare your race to somebody else's
[2:05:39] race just run your race
[2:05:42] run it
[2:05:44] with patience
[2:05:46] don't even question it
[2:05:49] somebody said i just get offended that
[2:05:51] you preach a gospel that says don't even
[2:05:54] question god along the way that's the
[2:05:57] one i preach
[2:05:59] that's what i'm preaching
[2:06:01] if you trust him you trust
[2:06:04] him
[2:06:07] by asking why you bring yourself into a
[2:06:12] place
[2:06:13] that you open up your mind
[2:06:16] to answers that you are not mature
[2:06:18] enough to hear
[2:06:20] so don't bother
[2:06:22] just say lord i trust you to the end
[2:06:25] we'll talk it
[2:06:28] over in the by and by
[2:06:33] we'll talk it over
[2:06:37] my lord and i
[2:06:40] i'll ask the reason
[2:06:44] he'll tell me why
[2:06:47] when we talk it over
[2:06:51] in the by and by you've got eternity
[2:06:54] church
[2:06:55] you've got eternity to discover the wise
[2:06:58] if you get to the end of your race and
[2:07:01] find out that you are still troubled
[2:07:05] by the questions that were formed by
[2:07:08] comparing your race
[2:07:10] to somebody else's race if you get there
[2:07:14] and it's still hanging in your mind you
[2:07:16] can talk to him
[2:07:19] you may not even have to ask the
[2:07:22] question
[2:07:23] because there's so much of god's glory
[2:07:26] and revelation in that dimension before
[2:07:29] you formulate the question the answer
[2:07:31] may already be in your heart and
[2:07:33] wouldn't that be wonderful
[2:07:35] how many of you believe it can be just
[2:07:36] like that you'll know
[2:07:39] all you need to know when you step into
[2:07:42] that place
[2:07:43] so stay out of that realm of why why why
[2:07:48] why
[2:07:50] especially the why me
[2:07:53] that didn't help chris christopherson
[2:07:55] and that's not going to help you
[2:07:57] why me lord
[2:08:01] now this this is the the truth about all
[2:08:03] that
[2:08:04] we wonder sometime why he chose us and
[2:08:08] the answer is never big enough to
[2:08:11] satisfy the longing
[2:08:13] the answer is
[2:08:14] because he could
[2:08:18] there you go
[2:08:20] why did he love me because he could
[2:08:27] big
[2:08:34] just be so glad he did
[2:08:38] that you serve him all the days of your
[2:08:40] life
[2:08:41] you get your pockets emptied out of all
[2:08:44] the rocks
[2:08:45] and run the race
[2:08:47] that is set before us anybody here
[2:08:51] here we go this is verse two
[2:08:53] and i have to hurry along looking away
[2:08:58] looking away
[2:09:01] looking away
[2:09:06] there's a twofold message here
[2:09:09] you are looking away
[2:09:11] from all that will distract
[2:09:15] you are looking away
[2:09:17] to jesus
[2:09:20] you're doing it at the same time
[2:09:23] you're consciously deciding not to look
[2:09:27] at the distractions of your life
[2:09:30] you are consciously deciding to look at
[2:09:34] jesus
[2:09:35] and allow him to satisfy
[2:09:38] every longing in your life every longing
[2:09:42] in your heart
[2:09:44] he satisfies that can anybody say man
[2:09:47] you can't say a man unless you're
[2:09:48] looking at him
[2:09:50] but when you start looking at him and
[2:09:52] seeing his beauty
[2:09:56] oh he's beautiful
[2:09:59] he is so beautiful
[2:10:01] i wished you men could say he is so
[2:10:04] beautiful
[2:10:07] somebody said i i just can't call
[2:10:10] another man beautiful he is so
[2:10:12] beautiful
[2:10:14] everything about him is lovely
[2:10:17] he's beautiful in all of his ways and
[2:10:20] all of his choices all of his decisions
[2:10:22] in all of his will purpose and ways for
[2:10:25] your life he's beautiful
[2:10:27] beautiful beautiful he's the only one
[2:10:29] qualified
[2:10:31] to choose a path for me
[2:10:34] because he's the only one that knows me
[2:10:38] nobody knows you like he knows you
[2:10:42] [Applause]
[2:10:43] he knows you're uprising and you're
[2:10:46] downsetting he knows what makes you tick
[2:10:50] more than anybody else
[2:10:52] anybody with me
[2:10:53] looking away from all that will distract
[2:10:55] to jesus
[2:10:57] who is the leader and the source
[2:11:00] of our faith giving the first incentive
[2:11:03] for our belief
[2:11:05] and is also its finisher
[2:11:09] bringing it to what
[2:11:11] maturity and perfection that's your
[2:11:14] faith
[2:11:15] now here's what i want to
[2:11:17] to put in your spirit for a moment he
[2:11:20] he
[2:11:21] for the joy of obtaining the prize
[2:11:26] that was set before him
[2:11:29] the trophy
[2:11:32] the prize
[2:11:34] that was set before him
[2:11:36] endured the cross
[2:11:40] despising
[2:11:42] and ignoring the shame
[2:11:45] and is now seated
[2:11:49] at the right hand
[2:11:53] of the throne of god
[2:11:56] for the joy
[2:11:58] for the joy
[2:12:01] for the joy
[2:12:03] for agonizing
[2:12:06] joy
[2:12:08] costly
[2:12:10] joy
[2:12:11] your joy has never cost him
[2:12:14] what his joy
[2:12:16] cost him
[2:12:20] in order for him
[2:12:21] to have joy
[2:12:23] and to keep joy
[2:12:26] and to endure the cross with joy
[2:12:29] it cost him everything he had
[2:12:33] no man suffered like he suffered
[2:12:36] no man hurt like he hurt
[2:12:39] nobody knew pain like he knew pain
[2:12:42] his pain was on so many different levels
[2:12:46] he not only experienced the physical
[2:12:48] pain of the crucifixion
[2:12:50] and the beating that preceded the
[2:12:52] crucifixion and carrying the weight of
[2:12:55] the cross
[2:12:57] all the way up to calvary with a little
[2:12:59] assistance along the way but he also
[2:13:02] endured the pain
[2:13:04] of kinos
[2:13:07] or what we say kinoses
[2:13:10] the separation
[2:13:14] of his father
[2:13:16] the god that lived inside of him
[2:13:20] left him
[2:13:22] because he made the decision
[2:13:26] to empty himself
[2:13:28] the bible said and we'll look at it he
[2:13:31] made himself of no reputation he emptied
[2:13:35] himself
[2:13:38] of everything that could have changed
[2:13:40] the course
[2:13:42] of the father's plan
[2:13:45] and there was nothing left in him but
[2:13:47] the yes
[2:13:52] if he would have died as god it would
[2:13:54] have not been nearly as miraculous and
[2:13:57] impacting
[2:13:59] but he chose to submit to the father's
[2:14:02] plan which was not to die as god
[2:14:06] father father
[2:14:09] why hast thou forsaken me
[2:14:12] he chose to die as man
[2:14:19] kinos
[2:14:20] kinosis
[2:14:22] the emptying of himself of all that was
[2:14:25] deity
[2:14:28] so that he could die then how am i saved
[2:14:32] if he died as an ordinary man how am i
[2:14:36] safe his blood
[2:14:41] the body that contained this blood the
[2:14:44] blood was god's life
[2:14:48] and though he hung there giving up
[2:14:52] everything that he had
[2:14:55] his blood was still the blood of god
[2:14:59] and it cried out in your behalf
[2:15:02] for your redemption
[2:15:04] he hung there an empty shell of a man
[2:15:10] emptied of all of authority and power
[2:15:14] the old songwriter said he could have
[2:15:17] called ten thousand angels
[2:15:21] why stop with ten thousand
[2:15:24] he could have called billions
[2:15:27] and billions of angels
[2:15:29] to come to his rescue
[2:15:34] but he chose to endure the cross
[2:15:38] and to endure it alone
[2:15:40] without the aid
[2:15:42] of the deity that he once contained
[2:15:45] powerful
[2:15:47] powerful
[2:15:49] there was only one thing
[2:15:51] that could keep him driving
[2:15:55] pushing
[2:15:56] in the right direction
[2:16:01] we already know that he struggled
[2:16:05] the scripture tells us that in
[2:16:07] gethsemane he struggled
[2:16:12] do we need to read it
[2:16:18] luke 22
[2:16:21] i'm so out of order in my notes
[2:16:24] you're still with me
[2:16:27] luke 22 41-44
[2:16:31] and he was withdrawn from them
[2:16:34] about a stone's cast
[2:16:38] that was it
[2:16:39] and kneeled down and prayed
[2:16:43] saying
[2:16:44] father if thou be willing
[2:16:49] remove this cup from me nevertheless not
[2:16:54] my will but thine be done
[2:16:57] i know that purest
[2:16:59] trinitarian doctrine would have an image
[2:17:02] painted in your mind that the father is
[2:17:04] looking over the balcony of heaven and
[2:17:07] the son is down there in in gethsemane
[2:17:10] crying out to a god that a father that
[2:17:13] he can't quite see nothing could be
[2:17:15] farther from the truth
[2:17:17] he was actually praying to the eternal
[2:17:20] spirit of his creator of his father who
[2:17:23] was in him
[2:17:25] and you may not understand it but jesus
[2:17:27] did
[2:17:28] and that's why he said to those around
[2:17:30] him when you've seen me
[2:17:33] you have seen the father
[2:17:36] have i been with you so long and you
[2:17:38] don't even recognize and know who i am
[2:17:41] because they were looking for an image
[2:17:43] of the father that they created in their
[2:17:46] own mind
[2:17:47] and they didn't see that jesus was the
[2:17:50] word
[2:17:51] made flesh he was the father in
[2:17:53] demonstration he was the mystery of god
[2:17:57] walking around in human flesh in skin in
[2:18:01] a body that could hurt
[2:18:03] in a body that could be emotional
[2:18:07] in a body that could suffer they did not
[2:18:10] understand it he is not praying to the
[2:18:13] to the first person of the trinity
[2:18:17] he's not praying to a father looking
[2:18:19] down on him in love
[2:18:22] but he is rather
[2:18:24] praying to the eternal spirit of the
[2:18:26] father that lives
[2:18:29] inside of him
[2:18:31] how did he get there because an angel of
[2:18:34] the lord came and brought a message and
[2:18:37] in that moment the holy ghost of god
[2:18:40] overshadowed mary
[2:18:43] and she he was conceived in her womb not
[2:18:47] having two fathers father and holy ghost
[2:18:49] but having won the same in the spirit
[2:18:52] and so now he's praying
[2:18:55] because this is the will of the one who
[2:18:57] has led him driven him actually
[2:19:00] every day of his life
[2:19:02] the spirit of the father that was in him
[2:19:04] had been driving him every day of his
[2:19:07] life he said i can do nothing
[2:19:11] i can do nothing on my own it's only
[2:19:13] what he i see him doing
[2:19:16] what i see him doing that's what i do
[2:19:18] brother branham said even our lord was
[2:19:21] led by vision
[2:19:23] are you with me
[2:19:24] what he saw the father doing that's what
[2:19:26] he did he couldn't do anything beyond
[2:19:29] that
[2:19:30] he was bound to do what his father was
[2:19:34] doing to say what his father was saying
[2:19:36] like father like son
[2:19:38] amen
[2:19:40] and here he is crying out father if thou
[2:19:43] be willing remove this cup from me
[2:19:46] nevertheless
[2:19:48] not my will
[2:19:52] oh my are you so tired
[2:19:55] or can you stay a little longer with me
[2:19:58] nevertheless
[2:20:03] i have a will
[2:20:05] jesus had a will he had a will according
[2:20:07] to the flesh
[2:20:08] in fact didn't he say my spirit is
[2:20:10] willing
[2:20:11] that part of me that's not me
[2:20:14] that part of me that was a gift
[2:20:17] the eternal spirit that lives inside of
[2:20:19] me now transformed any any any remnant
[2:20:22] of human spirit that i might have
[2:20:24] carried
[2:20:26] it's willing
[2:20:29] but this flesh
[2:20:30] this body you gave me
[2:20:33] it's weak
[2:20:35] i'm asking if there's any other way
[2:20:38] if there's a plan b that you haven't let
[2:20:40] me know anything about could you please
[2:20:42] pull that out could we go with plan b if
[2:20:46] there's any way
[2:20:47] that this could be accomplished without
[2:20:49] this suffering i would rather much
[2:20:51] rather have it that way nevertheless
[2:20:55] the very word gethsemane is that olive
[2:20:58] press
[2:21:00] it means the pressing of the olive it's
[2:21:03] it's a crushing
[2:21:05] like patmos means my killing
[2:21:08] john had to die before he could see he
[2:21:12] had to die before he could walk through
[2:21:14] the revelation for one door
[2:21:16] he had to die
[2:21:17] jesus had to die
[2:21:20] he didn't just die at calvary he died at
[2:21:23] gethsemane
[2:21:25] in fact they say if jesus was ever going
[2:21:28] to fail you
[2:21:30] it wouldn't have been on the cross
[2:21:32] it would have been in gethsemane
[2:21:34] when he had the father's ear
[2:21:36] oh if there's any other way
[2:21:38] nevertheless nevertheless nevertheless
[2:21:42] listen folk if you can learn the
[2:21:44] nevertheless
[2:21:45] if you can learn the nevertheless when
[2:21:47] you're in a corner if you can just learn
[2:21:49] to say and mean nevertheless
[2:21:51] nevertheless nevertheless nevertheless
[2:21:55] oh i want him to live
[2:21:59] nevertheless he is not mine he is yours
[2:22:07] i want that cancer gone
[2:22:11] nevertheless
[2:22:13] he doesn't belong to me she belongs to
[2:22:15] you
[2:22:17] nevertheless not my will
[2:22:20] but thine be done what a prayer what a
[2:22:23] prayer and there appeared an angel unto
[2:22:25] him
[2:22:26] ah the next verse
[2:22:29] and there appeared an angel unto him
[2:22:31] from heaven strengthening him
[2:22:34] ministering to him don't ever
[2:22:37] misunderstand the ministry of angels
[2:22:40] they are not just holy protectors
[2:22:43] they are not just holy warriors
[2:22:45] they also bring bomb
[2:22:48] they bring ointment they bring strength
[2:22:51] they bring healing from the presence of
[2:22:53] his face they've been in his presence
[2:22:56] they have stood before his face and they
[2:22:58] come to strengthen him and they come to
[2:23:02] strengthen us
[2:23:04] when we are at our nevertheless moment
[2:23:07] anybody with me
[2:23:08] strengthening him the next verse
[2:23:11] and being in an agony
[2:23:15] the first title of this message is the
[2:23:17] agony
[2:23:18] of joy
[2:23:20] and being in an agony he prayed more
[2:23:24] earnestly
[2:23:26] and his sweat was as it were great drops
[2:23:29] of blood falling down to the ground this
[2:23:33] was the hardest
[2:23:35] moment of his life
[2:23:38] it was not the weight of the cross it
[2:23:41] was not the lashing of the cat of nine
[2:23:43] tails it wasn't the planning of
[2:23:46] a thorny crown it was not a sword in his
[2:23:50] side it was not the hook between his
[2:23:53] legs it was not his naked condition
[2:23:59] it wasn't the gall the bitter
[2:24:03] the vinegar that was given to him when
[2:24:05] he was thirsty
[2:24:08] that which he refused because
[2:24:10] the hyssop
[2:24:12] would have numbed the pain
[2:24:15] it was none of that
[2:24:19] none of that was his greatest moment
[2:24:22] of pressure
[2:24:25] his greatest moment of testing
[2:24:28] and trial was here
[2:24:30] being in agony prayed more earnestly his
[2:24:33] sweat was as it were great drops of
[2:24:35] blood falling down to the ground every
[2:24:38] system of his body so strained and
[2:24:40] stressed until the blood was leaching
[2:24:43] out of the vessels and capillaries of
[2:24:45] his body he was in a tremendous strain
[2:24:49] his heart was near to
[2:24:54] bursting medical science tells us the
[2:24:58] strength the weight of the world
[2:25:00] didn't meet him at the cross
[2:25:03] the weight of the world met him with the
[2:25:06] weight of doing his father's will in the
[2:25:08] garden of gethsemane the sin that you
[2:25:11] saw him hanging on the cross with
[2:25:13] carrying your sin it didn't meet him on
[2:25:16] the cross the weight of your sin met him
[2:25:19] in the garden
[2:25:22] and the strain of it on his physical
[2:25:24] form the body of flesh was so severe
[2:25:28] that he was almost to the place of
[2:25:30] having an explosion of his heart
[2:25:33] and the sack was straining
[2:25:36] the pericardium that the heart was in
[2:25:38] was straining beneath the pressure of
[2:25:41] that heart pump pumping pumping pumping
[2:25:45] pumping pumping such stream
[2:25:48] until at calvary it happened
[2:25:52] but it was close to happening in
[2:25:55] gethsemane finally at calvary his heart
[2:25:58] exploded
[2:25:59] the pericardium burst and the fluid not
[2:26:02] blood
[2:26:03] but the fluid of the pericardium
[2:26:06] that that watery substance that protects
[2:26:09] the heart
[2:26:16] went rushing through his body
[2:26:19] so that when the
[2:26:20] sphere
[2:26:21] went in his side
[2:26:23] the scripture records that blood and
[2:26:26] water
[2:26:27] pericardial fluid
[2:26:29] heart fluid
[2:26:31] and blood
[2:26:32] come running out the side
[2:26:34] no man suffered
[2:26:38] like he suffered
[2:26:41] if if it's true and the scriptures are
[2:26:44] clear and and we can look at it i have a
[2:26:48] few more minutes
[2:26:52] look at philippians 2 with me just a
[2:26:53] moment
[2:26:55] philippians 2
[2:26:57] verse 5 and 6 let this mind be in you
[2:27:02] which was also in christ jesus
[2:27:05] who being in the form of god
[2:27:08] thought it was not robbery to be equal
[2:27:11] with god that word form in the greek is
[2:27:14] morphe
[2:27:17] you hear brother branham talking about
[2:27:19] and morphe
[2:27:22] that word form is morphe and and it
[2:27:25] means
[2:27:26] uh the the form by which a person or
[2:27:29] thing strikes the vision
[2:27:32] a physical image
[2:27:36] an external appearance
[2:27:40] he was in the form of god
[2:27:44] he had the external
[2:27:46] appearance
[2:27:49] the morphe
[2:27:51] of god
[2:27:54] in
[2:27:55] verse 7
[2:27:57] but made himself of no
[2:28:01] what's that word
[2:28:04] in greek it's kino
[2:28:07] he made himself of no reputation and
[2:28:10] took upon him the form
[2:28:12] of a servant form
[2:28:14] more faith
[2:28:17] and was made in the likeness
[2:28:20] of men
[2:28:22] that scripture he made himself of no
[2:28:24] reputation
[2:28:26] is the same word that is used later in
[2:28:29] the scripture
[2:28:30] for the kinoses
[2:28:33] meaning that he emptied himself
[2:28:38] it actually says
[2:28:41] in verse
[2:28:43] 8 or 9. i don't have it in front of me
[2:28:45] here
[2:28:46] he humbled himself
[2:28:50] can you give me verse 8 even though we
[2:28:52] don't have it thank you i can't find
[2:28:53] what i did with it
[2:28:55] and and being found in the fashion as a
[2:28:58] man he humbled himself
[2:29:02] he it means he brought himself low he
[2:29:05] depressed himself he brought down who he
[2:29:09] was
[2:29:11] to behave in an unassuming manner to
[2:29:14] bring to a humble condition to bring to
[2:29:18] emptiness
[2:29:19] until there is no vanity there is only
[2:29:23] nothingness
[2:29:24] this is a powerful demonstration of that
[2:29:27] word
[2:29:28] this is what he did
[2:29:30] and became obedient unto death even the
[2:29:34] death of the cross
[2:29:36] that was the battle of the will
[2:29:40] that took place
[2:29:43] are you are you able to go just a few
[2:29:45] more moments
[2:29:47] in the message the mighty god unveiled
[2:29:49] before us paragraph 35
[2:29:52] and dr schofield here
[2:29:55] we find that his word changing from form
[2:29:59] we find the word and morphe in greek
[2:30:02] which means the unseen
[2:30:05] was made visible the formless was given
[2:30:07] a form
[2:30:09] something that cannot we we know it's
[2:30:11] there
[2:30:12] it cannot be seen but yet we know that
[2:30:15] it's there and when he changed his form
[2:30:20] of the amorphy which means he changed
[2:30:23] from supernatural to natural
[2:30:28] and he just changed his mask
[2:30:31] in other words it's like a drama he was
[2:30:33] acting in the greek when they would
[2:30:35] change their mass remember one actor
[2:30:39] playing many different roles
[2:30:41] with not big costume changes just mask
[2:30:45] changes
[2:30:46] the same man could be both the villain
[2:30:49] and the hero
[2:30:51] by only changing the mass one player
[2:30:54] might have acted in several different
[2:30:56] parts brother branham said and then
[2:30:58] in the same message paragraph 38 now
[2:31:01] if you will take the old testament
[2:31:02] prophecies concerning what the messiah
[2:31:05] was to be you can compare it with the
[2:31:07] life of jesus and you've got exactly who
[2:31:09] jesus was he was not just an ordinary
[2:31:12] man
[2:31:13] are you with me
[2:31:14] he was god in more faith he was changed
[2:31:18] form
[2:31:19] from the supernatural into the natural
[2:31:22] form of a man yet he was god
[2:31:24] manifested in the flesh veiled
[2:31:27] by a human
[2:31:28] fleshly veil in the same message
[2:31:31] paragraph 205 he says god listen to this
[2:31:34] one
[2:31:35] god
[2:31:36] in his in morphe again
[2:31:40] unveiled himself and make himself known
[2:31:44] to his people
[2:31:46] the great king who laid aside his glory
[2:31:49] yet a little while and the world won't
[2:31:51] see me no more i'll be veiled to them
[2:31:54] because i will now be
[2:32:02] let me tell you folks jesus is here
[2:32:06] jesus is here don't just get your eyes
[2:32:08] on his coming and miss the fact that he
[2:32:10] has come he is here i don't
[2:32:14] you just let the critics roar he is here
[2:32:16] jesus is here
[2:32:19] where is he he is in bright form
[2:32:25] he's in bride form that's what he said
[2:32:27] it's a direct quote you can amen
[2:32:30] he's here
[2:32:32] in bride form
[2:32:35] this way the world misses him
[2:32:38] but the royal seat of abraham they
[2:32:41] recognize him when they meet him along
[2:32:44] the way
[2:32:46] hallelujah
[2:32:48] and you and i if we can get our pockets
[2:32:51] emptied out
[2:32:53] of all the rocks
[2:32:55] and all the hindrances
[2:32:58] and all the weights and sins
[2:33:01] the unbelief
[2:33:03] that so easily distracts and besets us
[2:33:06] on the journey then we can have even
[2:33:08] more of him
[2:33:10] formed in us
[2:33:12] amen working the same works among us and
[2:33:15] through us that he worked at calvary if
[2:33:19] you believe that
[2:33:20] you can say amen
[2:33:23] if if it's true and i i have
[2:33:25] much more to go over with you about this
[2:33:29] but if it's true i don't want to miss
[2:33:32] what the theme was to be today to start
[2:33:34] get us started
[2:33:36] if it's true that he was emptied
[2:33:39] if it's true that his father was not
[2:33:41] there
[2:33:43] to strengthen him on the cross
[2:33:46] if it's true that he truly was
[2:33:50] forsaken
[2:33:53] even the songwriter says
[2:33:56] his father turned his back
[2:33:59] the son to die alone
[2:34:02] it's not just figurative poetic
[2:34:05] he was emptied
[2:34:09] of all
[2:34:10] deity
[2:34:12] and died
[2:34:14] as a man
[2:34:17] shedding god's blood
[2:34:19] but he died
[2:34:20] as a man what kept him
[2:34:25] how could he do it
[2:34:29] there were two men hanging on either
[2:34:31] side going to meet the same
[2:34:33] same fate in a moment
[2:34:35] their life ebbing away
[2:34:37] and one of them died calling on mercy
[2:34:40] and one of them died
[2:34:42] cursing could have died just like the
[2:34:45] thief
[2:34:47] in anger
[2:34:50] in frustration somebody said well how
[2:34:52] could that be possible well i tell you
[2:34:53] how because he could get angry
[2:34:58] he turned over the tables and and and
[2:35:00] pushed out
[2:35:02] those who were merchandising in his
[2:35:04] father's house
[2:35:06] he had the ability to plant the whip
[2:35:09] for the righteous indignation of god
[2:35:14] he could have died angry bitter
[2:35:18] what
[2:35:20] i go all the way
[2:35:23] can you leave me
[2:35:24] here to die alone somebody said i can't
[2:35:28] even get my mind around this then you
[2:35:29] don't understand the new testament
[2:35:31] scripture and who he really was
[2:35:33] because we are told that in all manner
[2:35:38] he was tempted even as we are
[2:35:41] yet without sin
[2:35:43] if you think he didn't have rejection
[2:35:45] issues
[2:35:47] then you can't have them
[2:35:49] because if you can have them he had them
[2:35:52] if they can tempt and torment him they
[2:35:54] can tempt and torment you and vice versa
[2:35:56] he was he could have done all he could
[2:35:58] have had all kinds of reactions
[2:36:01] because right now he was only knowing
[2:36:03] agony
[2:36:05] there wasn't much
[2:36:06] glory
[2:36:08] the earth was dark
[2:36:11] the sun hit its face
[2:36:13] it refused to shine
[2:36:16] the earth is beginning to rumble
[2:36:18] beneath the surface
[2:36:21] as those plates beneath the cross
[2:36:23] begin to move back and forth
[2:36:26] all of creation is turned upside down
[2:36:30] because they see
[2:36:33] the in morphe of their creator
[2:36:37] the form of their creator dying
[2:36:42] you talk about
[2:36:44] sister
[2:36:45] flo singing
[2:36:46] no little yellow flowers in bloom
[2:36:52] no beauty
[2:36:53] there was no beauty in him isaiah said
[2:36:57] that you would desire him
[2:37:01] he was nothing to look at
[2:37:04] just one
[2:37:06] tangled mess
[2:37:08] of bloody tissue
[2:37:12] scars and
[2:37:14] bruises and tears
[2:37:18] in isaiah
[2:37:22] 53
[2:37:27] somewhere in the notes
[2:37:31] verses 10 and 11
[2:37:35] i needed
[2:37:36] a week
[2:37:38] yet it pleased the lord
[2:37:41] to bruise him
[2:37:44] and he hath put him to grief
[2:37:47] when thou shalt make his soul an
[2:37:49] offering for sin
[2:37:51] he
[2:37:54] shall
[2:37:56] see
[2:37:56] [Music]
[2:37:58] his seat
[2:38:04] and the pleasure
[2:38:06] of the lord let's see it goes on he
[2:38:08] shall prolong his days
[2:38:11] and the pleasure of the lord
[2:38:15] shall prosper
[2:38:18] in
[2:38:19] his hands
[2:38:22] or in his hand
[2:38:24] he shall see of the travail of his soul
[2:38:29] and shall be satisfied
[2:38:33] by his knowledge
[2:38:35] shall my righteous servant justify many
[2:38:41] for he
[2:38:42] shall bear their iniquities this is not
[2:38:47] the description of an earthly king like
[2:38:49] some commentators would have you to
[2:38:51] believe
[2:38:53] this is a prophetic description of our
[2:38:57] lord tangled
[2:38:59] mangled twisted bloody
[2:39:03] you could have stood at the foot of the
[2:39:06] cross and watched his heart beating
[2:39:11] ripped open
[2:39:12] his body
[2:39:15] inside spilling out
[2:39:17] of his body
[2:39:21] blood running down in his eyes
[2:39:25] a tangled mangled
[2:39:27] mess
[2:39:28] of humanity
[2:39:31] so close to death
[2:39:37] something held him there
[2:39:40] something kept him in place
[2:39:44] it was for the joy
[2:39:50] can you think of anything joyful about
[2:39:52] the scene that i just described
[2:39:56] there is nothing joyful about his
[2:39:59] condition
[2:40:01] but he remembered
[2:40:06] i
[2:40:07] have a body
[2:40:10] this is not my body
[2:40:15] this is one form
[2:40:18] i have a body that will rise in her day
[2:40:24] i have a people that will overcome in
[2:40:27] their satan's eden
[2:40:30] i'll have a people that will overcome
[2:40:33] lukewarm christianity in their day and
[2:40:37] find their purpose
[2:40:41] filled with joy to see you and i
[2:40:45] tove
[2:40:49] to see us
[2:40:50] bearing the seed that we were created to
[2:40:54] bear and giving harvest
[2:40:57] giving expression to the seed that is
[2:41:00] within us hallelujah
[2:41:02] are you here
[2:41:04] joy
[2:41:07] uncontainable
[2:41:11] indescribable
[2:41:14] unspeakable
[2:41:17] joy
[2:41:18] filled his heart
[2:41:23] you were in his mind
[2:41:26] this day this hour this season
[2:41:31] he saw it
[2:41:33] he knew it
[2:41:36] just when it looked like the light
[2:41:39] would be completely stamped out
[2:41:44] the moon only a sliver
[2:41:48] in this hour
[2:41:49] and yet a people alaba hoshika mahaya
[2:41:52] whoa you didn't hear that
[2:41:56] a people
[2:41:58] with all all they need
[2:42:00] all they need is for god to show up in a
[2:42:03] sliver of the moon
[2:42:05] just come on jesus just come on and
[2:42:07] remind us just come on and let us see
[2:42:10] your word just come on and let us see
[2:42:12] ourself
[2:42:15] we've not strived yet to death
[2:42:18] we haven't strived yet to blood
[2:42:22] he did it for us
[2:42:24] all of our suffering all of our
[2:42:26] whippings all of our chastisement none
[2:42:29] of it can measure
[2:42:31] to what he endured
[2:42:34] he endured the cross
[2:42:37] how
[2:42:38] how
[2:42:40] with joy
[2:42:42] the agony
[2:42:44] of joy
[2:42:46] the pain
[2:42:49] was forgotten
[2:42:51] in a glimpse
[2:42:53] of you
[2:42:58] you
[2:43:04] in all of your warts
[2:43:07] and your crooked nose
[2:43:10] and your lesson beautiful disposition
[2:43:14] and all of our selfishness
[2:43:16] come on
[2:43:18] in all of the ways we disrespect him and
[2:43:20] his word and his house
[2:43:22] come on
[2:43:24] in all of our failures
[2:43:28] those of you who couldn't even look at
[2:43:29] me earlier in this service when i was
[2:43:31] speaking the truth because you are so
[2:43:34] filled with your own wrong opinion that
[2:43:36] you reject the truth as it comes to you
[2:43:39] service after service after service even
[2:43:43] you even you
[2:43:44] even you
[2:43:46] he saw you
[2:43:49] and he gave him joy
[2:43:52] because he saw the end
[2:43:55] he saw the end
[2:43:57] he saw the end
[2:43:59] he saw what the word would accomplish
[2:44:03] he saw what his blood would accomplish
[2:44:06] he saw what your obedience
[2:44:09] would accomplish
[2:44:11] and he went all the way
[2:44:13] he went all the way
[2:44:15] the agony of joy returning to joy the
[2:44:20] high cost
[2:44:23] of joy
[2:44:28] so
[2:44:29] in closing musicians coming
[2:44:32] let's be honest with you i'm about to
[2:44:34] lose my britches
[2:44:37] so i got to stop
[2:44:39] or have a costume change
[2:44:43] in all of the suffering and all that he
[2:44:46] went through joy held him there
[2:44:51] joy kept him there
[2:44:53] joy made it worthwhile you with me
[2:44:57] joy made it worthwhile you don't know
[2:44:59] near as much
[2:45:00] as you think you know sometime and
[2:45:02] neither do i
[2:45:03] but god
[2:45:04] sees
[2:45:06] it all
[2:45:09] he sees it all
[2:45:11] he sees it all we still look through a
[2:45:14] glass darkly sometime but that's our
[2:45:16] choice
[2:45:18] if you're still looking through a dark
[2:45:19] glass that is your choice you do not
[2:45:22] have to look any longer through a glass
[2:45:24] darkly because we now have a clear
[2:45:28] picture
[2:45:30] his word has become unveiled before us
[2:45:33] we can see him no longer through a dark
[2:45:36] glass but in the splendor
[2:45:40] the glory of his beauty
[2:45:43] nothing hidden any longer
[2:45:48] if joy was enough
[2:45:50] if seeing you reach your destiny in
[2:45:54] in in this life the father's plan
[2:45:57] for you in the end if seeing that was
[2:46:00] enough
[2:46:01] to give him the strength that he needed
[2:46:03] to endure
[2:46:05] the cross
[2:46:07] it speaks to us of the hugeness of his
[2:46:09] price the price he paid the sacrifice he
[2:46:12] made it also speaks to us of the value
[2:46:17] of joy
[2:46:24] joy
[2:46:25] is valuable
[2:46:28] i woke up this morning singing an old
[2:46:30] henson song this joy is mine
[2:46:34] it is it is it is it is it is
[2:46:37] dare misunderstand joy
[2:46:41] it doesn't mean you always dance a jig
[2:46:44] he wasn't dancing a jig
[2:46:49] you don't always laugh
[2:46:53] in the throes of joy
[2:46:55] he wasn't laughing
[2:46:58] joy is not always a celebration
[2:47:02] i've taught you all these years there's
[2:47:04] a great difference between happiness and
[2:47:06] joy
[2:47:07] happiness
[2:47:09] it goes and comes
[2:47:11] it's fickle based on circumstances
[2:47:14] you can be having the time of your life
[2:47:16] and one phone call
[2:47:19] can end it all
[2:47:21] you go from the from the throws of
[2:47:23] happiness to the to the depths of
[2:47:25] despair to hopelessness in five seconds
[2:47:28] everything can change your happiness
[2:47:30] but joy doesn't work like that joy is a
[2:47:33] deep deep deep deep deep rock
[2:47:39] way down in the excuse me for saying the
[2:47:42] good
[2:47:43] way
[2:47:44] down somewhere way down in the inner man
[2:47:48] he places
[2:47:50] on the inside of the inside let us say
[2:47:53] the joy the joy the joy the joy
[2:48:07] no wonder
[2:48:11] then he said unto them
[2:48:13] 8 10 nehemiah go your way eat the fat
[2:48:16] drink the sweet
[2:48:18] send portions unto them for whom nothing
[2:48:20] is prepared for this day is holy unto
[2:48:23] the lord neither be ye sorry
[2:48:28] no morning
[2:48:31] no weeping
[2:48:33] no depression
[2:48:36] for the joy for the joy
[2:48:40] for the joy of the lord
[2:48:44] is your strength
[2:48:46] what was his joy
[2:48:49] seeing you
[2:48:51] fulfilling
[2:48:52] your god-called destiny
[2:48:54] was his joy
[2:48:56] seeing you birthed in his image
[2:48:59] shining like the sun
[2:49:01] but only the moon reflecting the light
[2:49:03] of the of the son seeing you believing
[2:49:07] the word for your day
[2:49:10] and obeying that's right
[2:49:12] not just seeing it but obeying it
[2:49:15] walking in it
[2:49:17] seeing you as a salmon
[2:49:20] swimming against the tide of popular
[2:49:23] opinion and holding on to the unmovable
[2:49:26] unshakable kingdom that's built on the
[2:49:29] everlasting true word of god
[2:49:32] seeing you in that place that was his
[2:49:35] joy knowing you'd be there knowing he
[2:49:38] didn't he didn't he maybe he wasn't
[2:49:39] rehearsing all the in-betweens but he
[2:49:42] just saw you at the end
[2:49:43] winning the mark winning the prize
[2:49:46] pressing the mark getting all the way
[2:49:48] through and for the joy for the joy for
[2:49:51] the joy that was before him he endured
[2:49:54] the cross and now the scripture talks
[2:49:56] about joy again and again and again and
[2:49:59] again and again and nehemiah says for
[2:50:01] the joy of the lord well where does he
[2:50:03] find his joy
[2:50:07] he finds his joy by looking at his
[2:50:10] people walking in surrendered obedience
[2:50:13] and love for him that's what gives him
[2:50:15] joy amen
[2:50:17] so you know what there's something to be
[2:50:19] said about you and i keeping our eyes
[2:50:25] he saw the finish line let's just boil
[2:50:27] it all down he had joy
[2:50:29] that kept him on the cross because he
[2:50:32] saw the finish line he saw the finish
[2:50:34] line anybody with me he saw the finish
[2:50:37] line there's something to be said about
[2:50:40] you and i choosing
[2:50:43] to keep our eyes on the finish line
[2:50:47] you see there's a trophy waiting on you
[2:50:50] at the finish line it's not of brass
[2:50:52] it's not of silver it's not of god
[2:50:56] it's him
[2:51:00] it's him
[2:51:02] hallelujah somebody praise him

[2:53:30] was nobody hurt
[2:53:31] and i've seen meetings
[2:53:34] this is your messenger
[2:53:37] seen meetings where the power of god was
[2:53:40] revealed to the people
[2:53:42] that they were free from the world
[2:53:46] and the things of the world
[2:53:49] and the joy of the lord
[2:53:53] filled the congregation
[2:53:57] can i give you a verse
[2:54:00] am i going
[2:54:01] all around yeah
[2:54:06] i spent most of the day with him
[2:54:08] yesterday
[2:54:10] and
[2:54:11] i thought i had it all figured out
[2:54:15] and that he came to me in the night
[2:54:23] and changed it all
[2:54:27] and it's been that way this morning
[2:54:32] i was laying in the bed and i normally
[2:54:34] get on up and get to the dining room
[2:54:36] table where i finish
[2:54:37] spend an hour
[2:54:39] every sunday morning finishing what i've
[2:54:41] worked on
[2:54:43] and i get over here and i have an hour
[2:54:45] to finish
[2:54:46] making sure it's printed making sure
[2:54:48] there's a copy of the scriptures and
[2:54:50] quotes for the
[2:54:51] ladies and sometimes making sure ezekiel
[2:54:53] has breakfast and
[2:54:55] but not this morning
[2:54:58] won't have plenty of time i don't want
[2:55:00] to rush don't want to be rushed
[2:55:02] because i don't know what he's going to
[2:55:03] say
[2:55:05] i can prepare and i can pull it together
[2:55:08] but i don't know what he's going to say
[2:55:11] but i was sitting here and
[2:55:14] you know i know
[2:55:17] i know that his hebrew name is not jesus
[2:55:21] i know that his hebrew name was
[2:55:22] something close to yeshua
[2:55:25] but i also know that he's not offended
[2:55:27] when the world calls him jesus oh no
[2:55:33] he reminded me one time
[2:55:36] of being in heavenly places and seeing
[2:55:38] the the name yeshua
[2:55:41] on a banner that angels were waving and
[2:55:44] right beside it was a banner with the
[2:55:46] name jesus on it
[2:55:48] and angels had made it i assume i don't
[2:55:50] know who made this banner but somebody
[2:55:52] heavenly made made one and it said
[2:55:54] yeshua and made one that said jesus and
[2:55:57] that settled some things for me
[2:56:00] it also blessed me to know that brother
[2:56:03] branham talks about how that
[2:56:05] there are three high holy words
[2:56:09] that the demons of hell cannot resist
[2:56:14] anybody familiar with it
[2:56:16] and he gives us great indication of what
[2:56:18] they are
[2:56:20] he said no demon no devil can stand
[2:56:22] before the name of jesus
[2:56:24] and he knows that he you call him yeshua
[2:56:26] he'll he'll say yes
[2:56:28] you call him jesus he'll say yes
[2:56:31] if you call him lord he'll say if you
[2:56:34] say hey you i need you
[2:56:36] it might not be hallowing his name it
[2:56:38] might not be the most respectful
[2:56:40] approach
[2:56:41] but he'll come
[2:56:44] you call on him he'll come he comes
[2:56:46] because of the pull of faith not because
[2:56:48] of the word
[2:56:49] but i i saw you this morning
[2:56:52] worshiping
[2:56:57] that that song i speak the name of jesus
[2:57:00] i can't even tell you how it has
[2:57:02] ministered to me
[2:57:04] since i heard it the first time
[2:57:06] i think of a little friend a doctor
[2:57:09] medical doctor now in mississippi
[2:57:13] who is uh
[2:57:14] really into all kinds of alternative
[2:57:16] treatments etc but a board-certified
[2:57:19] medical doctor also a jesus name
[2:57:21] apostolic
[2:57:23] and he didn't even
[2:57:25] he believed there was a whole lot of
[2:57:26] hype going on and that a lot of things
[2:57:28] weren't just like we were being told
[2:57:30] but he got hit very very hard
[2:57:33] by covid very hard and he had all the
[2:57:37] different equipment and all the all the
[2:57:38] things that he uses for for people for
[2:57:41] patients who come and all kinds of
[2:57:43] treatments and
[2:57:46] vibration therapies and
[2:57:49] shocks and i don't know what all he does
[2:57:50] i don't even know
[2:57:52] someone paid for us to go and we never
[2:57:55] go and refunded the money we didn't ever
[2:57:57] go ever felt like it was right time to
[2:57:59] go but anyway
[2:58:00] he's pretty sick he was a few months ago
[2:58:03] and he was reaching out for
[2:58:06] for prayer and just saying i'm going to
[2:58:07] get through this by the grace of god i'm
[2:58:09] going to make it through he lost his
[2:58:10] mother during the process
[2:58:14] and he said i just want to share with
[2:58:15] you and i'd already heard the song he
[2:58:17] said i just want to share with you what
[2:58:18] got me through i sat for hours in the
[2:58:21] chair and played this song over my life
[2:58:24] well crystal i mean charity gail singing
[2:58:27] it
[2:58:28] boy i have a hard time charity i want to
[2:58:30] call her charity grace or crystal gail
[2:58:35] i'm dating myself a little bit right
[2:58:37] with crystal gale most of you some of
[2:58:39] you couldn't have no clue who that is
[2:58:41] but her name is charity charity gail
[2:58:45] is that right
[2:58:47] and he said i let that song play over me
[2:58:49] sitting in my chair i speak the name of
[2:58:52] jesus
[2:58:53] over every sickness
[2:58:55] i speak the name of jesus over every
[2:58:58] fear i speak the name of jesus over
[2:59:01] every anxiety
[2:59:03] and i've been watching how you come i've
[2:59:05] been watching how you respond i've even
[2:59:08] sensed that that you're criticized even
[2:59:11] in this house some of you
[2:59:12] for making that approach don't you ever
[2:59:16] let the thought
[2:59:18] of that cross your mind when you are
[2:59:22] determined to gather and worship him you
[2:59:25] don't have to come you are not pressured
[2:59:28] to come but you are always invited to
[2:59:31] come and don't you think about anything
[2:59:34] but him
[2:59:35] when you're making up your mind to come
[2:59:38] and i'll tell you this don't study it

[3:40:45] to all of you it's such a blessing to be
[3:40:47] here today
[3:40:49] the enemy tried to keep me home all
[3:40:51] through the night
[3:40:52] i wasn't well
[3:40:54] and
[3:40:55] i didn't sleep in the bed last night i
[3:40:57] was in the living room
[3:40:58] and when robert got up he came to me and
[3:41:01] he said you okay
[3:41:04] and i just
[3:41:05] determined yes i'm okay by the grace of
[3:41:07] god i'm okay by the grace of god i have
[3:41:10] these symptoms but i'm okay by the grace
[3:41:12] of god and all morning getting ready i
[3:41:14] just pushed through by the grace of god
[3:41:16] and i just kept praising the lord
[3:41:18] and kept praying
[3:41:21] and i get here and we're praying we're
[3:41:23] singing and it dawns on me i have none
[3:41:25] of those symptoms anymore and by the
[3:41:28] grace of god i was here and it was an
[3:41:31] ordained day to be here
[3:41:34] and i'm so blessed to be here and be
[3:41:37] with you and to share this moment
[3:41:39] because i believe this moment
[3:41:41] is a marker in time for us there's
[3:41:43] something happening in our midst
[3:41:46] and i'm so glad i didn't miss it i'm so
[3:41:49] glad i didn't let the enemy talk me out
[3:41:51] of it and say you're not feeling well
[3:41:53] and you can't make it
[3:41:55] i press through
[3:41:56] i press through by the grace of god
[3:41:59] amen
[3:42:06] um
[3:42:08] i just want to say to olivia like your
[3:42:10] anointing has broken so much in my life
[3:42:12] just this morning but also
[3:42:14] while we were singing
[3:42:16] the song again in the end um in the
[3:42:18] spirit the lord showed me a dragon over
[3:42:21] my family
[3:42:22] and slaying the dragon with the sword
[3:42:24] and i just want to speak that that
[3:42:26] dragon i don't even know what that
[3:42:27] symbolizes i'll have to go look it up
[3:42:28] but it's broken off my family and that
[3:42:30] curse is broken off
[3:42:41] yes
[3:42:52] uh
[3:42:53] that uh
[3:42:54] you know
[3:42:55] me and
[3:42:56] me and blasphemy we've been going
[3:42:58] through a bunch of stuff it's the car

[3:43:03] look
[3:43:04] like i told you

[3:43:08] get their glory out of that no matter
[3:43:11] what

[3:43:38] and the lord told me to come home and
[3:43:40] come to church today we got up at 5 30
[3:43:43] we were tired
[3:43:46] of
[3:43:50] [Applause]

[3:43:59] turn your cheek if they slap you turn
[3:44:02] your cheek we don't want to do that in
[3:44:03] humanity
[3:44:05] but if somebody hits you turn your cheek
[3:44:08] love them pray for them who persecute
[3:44:10] you love them who hate you it don't
[3:44:12] matter
[3:44:13] it don't matter what matters is your
[3:44:16] walk with the lord in your communication
[3:44:18] with god because in the end when you
[3:44:20] stand before almighty god and then word
[3:44:23] what that person did for you and what
[3:44:24] they were or what they look like
[3:44:27] whatever what's going on
[3:44:30] and i just want to tell that body here
[3:44:32] god loves you you are the bride god is
[3:44:34] calling us to a higher place than most
[3:44:37] people
[3:44:56] and i ain't ashamed of that but i'm
[3:44:58] telling you i love you and i thank you
[3:45:01] my mother
[3:45:04] [Applause]

[3:45:30] been through a lot these past few years
[3:45:32] as you all know but god's been dealing
[3:45:34] with me and i won't share the details
[3:45:36] but
[3:45:38] yesterday
[3:45:39] jaya can attest to we had
[3:45:42] a rough time and it was a struggle and
[3:45:44] we weren't sure why and i didn't make it
[3:45:47] to the baby shower but the lord knows
[3:45:49] and when i went home i was so defeated i
[3:45:52] was so tired i was so
[3:45:54] fogg-brained
[3:45:56] and i was in tears and didn't know why
[3:45:59] and just a place of just feeling
[3:46:02] desolate
[3:46:04] and i was talking to john on the phone i
[3:46:06] got off the phone she says i'm praying
[3:46:08] for you and i was praying for her and i
[3:46:10] put in i decided you know it doesn't
[3:46:12] matter if the kids are screaming it
[3:46:14] doesn't matter if the house is amazing
[3:46:16] but in my earphones block out the noise
[3:46:19] and put some worship music on and i tell
[3:46:21] you what i have a revival in my home
[3:46:24] last night
[3:46:28] i tell her i've had a revival over here
[3:46:30] and i'm praying that it goes your way
[3:46:32] and i came in i was so expected this
[3:46:34] morning
[3:46:36] you know so many things could have set
[3:46:39] me back
[3:46:40] i missed my lord my husband wanted me
[3:46:42] home
[3:46:43] elijah wanted to stay home
[3:46:46] food wasn't fixed there's just so many
[3:46:48] things and i was like i have joy in my
[3:46:50] heart i'm going to church today
[3:46:57] [Applause]
[3:47:04] [Applause]
[3:47:20] [Music]
[3:47:30] i yeah jesus
[3:47:58] [Applause]
[3:48:15] singing about somebody testified i was
[3:48:17] up front and i realized i'm standing
[3:48:20] almost in the same place i was when the
[3:48:22] lord delivered me at the root of
[3:48:23] bitterness in my life in 2014. i was
[3:48:27] standing on that front row where i still
[3:48:29] was this morning and i was standing
[3:48:31] there and i was trying to enter into the
[3:48:33] song and into the worship service
[3:48:37] and i remember standing there and i was
[3:48:39] thinking
[3:48:41] trying to focus on the lord and instead
[3:48:43] i was focusing on the things that i had
[3:48:45] been going through and i was so bitter
[3:48:47] towards certain people not just that
[3:48:50] there was bitterness there was directed
[3:48:52] bitterness in my heart and i was
[3:48:54] standing there on that front row and i
[3:48:56] was trying to be in the spirit but my
[3:48:58] mind was so focused on the bitterness
[3:49:01] that i carried and brother shelley was
[3:49:03] singing that song sweet anointing
[3:49:06] and he said the song that line about
[3:49:08] just
[3:49:16] [Music]
[3:49:23] because i walked away from that lord no
[3:49:26] longer carrying a root of bitterness and
[3:49:28] anger in my life
[3:49:31] and i just want to testify
[3:49:33] because i didn't take the opportunity
[3:49:35] when he was singing testify so here's my
[3:49:38] testimony
[3:49:40] [Applause]
[3:50:29] for this house and for your leadership
[3:50:31] yes for those who press in here
[3:50:34] this morning when we were singing that
[3:50:36] song and you started calling out the
[3:50:37] names of the nations
[3:50:40] i can't tell you how much that meant to
[3:50:42] me because i have cried out that our
[3:50:44] body here would do that
[3:50:46] god is never going to bless us to the
[3:50:48] fullness that he has until we
[3:50:50] put our caters and needs behind us amen
[3:50:53] and we cry out for those
[3:50:55] around our world
[3:50:57] in this neighborhood
[3:50:59] when we stop focusing on us
[3:51:03] that's what he's going to show me here
[3:51:06] and i think he broke something this
[3:51:08] morning by doing that
[3:51:10] and when we in the end
[3:51:11] that we turn sometimes
[3:51:14] so many people that strain they say you
[3:51:16] don't know how much it means when you
[3:51:17] turn to us we feel like you're looking
[3:51:20] at us because our backs are always to
[3:51:21] them and this morning that's the lord's
[3:51:24] had me a couple of times recently with
[3:51:25] the flags and things to turn around and
[3:51:27] face the cameras
[3:51:29] so i want to encourage us as a body if
[3:51:32] you think about it if god puts it on
[3:51:33] your heart don't feel awkward
[3:51:35] turn and hold your head up to those
[3:51:37] cameras because you have no idea what's
[3:51:40] going on in the world in the nations
[3:51:42] that they need to know that we recognize
[3:51:45] they're there
[3:51:46] and so i just want to thank you this
[3:51:48] morning for starting that and i really
[3:51:50] believe
[3:51:51] something is shifted and broken
[3:51:57] [Applause]
[3:52:15] i like to testify as well
[3:52:18] tiffany's absolutely correct yesterday
[3:52:20] was a struggle
[3:52:22] and
[3:52:22] i went to bed before i went to bed last
[3:52:24] night i had a conversation with the lord
[3:52:27] that was so precious so sweet and it was
[3:52:29] just me and him talking about his word
[3:52:31] and just fellowship
[3:52:33] and then this morning when i woke up
[3:52:35] i felt this heaviness
[3:52:37] it was just the heaviness that i
[3:52:39] couldn't even move
[3:52:40] and so
[3:52:42] i got up and did what i could and then
[3:52:44] went back to bed and probably at 9 30 i
[3:52:46] was like i gotta go
[3:52:48] i gotta go
[3:52:49] i rolled out of bed and i don't know
[3:52:51] what hit me but i know it was the spirit
[3:52:53] that rolled up within me i started
[3:52:55] declaring every truth that he has spoken
[3:52:58] over me the depression and everything
[3:53:00] else that i've carried throughout my
[3:53:02] life can no longer hinder me and then i
[3:53:04] started having a praise fit i tell you i
[3:53:07] was all over the house screaming and
[3:53:10] dancing and praising the lord and i'm so
[3:53:12] grateful because when i came into this
[3:53:14] house
[3:53:15] we were worshiping i felt chains of
[3:53:17] bondage break off of me that were trying
[3:53:20] to
[3:53:20] reattach but in the name of jesus
[3:53:30] [Applause]
[3:54:01] um
[3:54:12] i couldn't read just the one verse he
[3:54:14] gave me i read the whole thing through
[3:54:16] several times and even in the amplified
[3:54:18] and it was just amazing and after
[3:54:21] reading that it gave me the peace uh to
[3:54:23] go to sleep i was just
[3:54:25] i don't know i'm just overflowing with a
[3:54:27] joy
[3:55:21] you
