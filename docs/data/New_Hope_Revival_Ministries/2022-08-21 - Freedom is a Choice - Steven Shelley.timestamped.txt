[42:31] god bless you
[42:36] praise god
[42:40] this song that i'm about to sing it's
[42:43] been on my heart for a long time and
[42:45] sunday i felt
[42:47] confirmation that i should sing it
[42:49] and i'mma give a little bit of a
[42:51] maybe an exhortation and explanation at
[42:54] the same time
[42:55] when brother shelley was
[42:57] reading and preaching out of numbers 14
[43:01] this verse verse 9. i'm gonna read seven
[43:03] through nine but verse nine
[43:05] was a confirmation for me because of a
[43:07] verse in the song that i'd been you know
[43:09] kind of struggling with
[43:10] and it says and they spake unto all
[43:12] joshua and aaron talking spake unto all
[43:14] the congregation of the children of
[43:16] israel saying
[43:17] the land which we pass through to spy it
[43:20] out is it exceeding good land
[43:22] if jehovah delight in us then he will
[43:24] bring us into this land and give it unto
[43:26] us a land which floweth with milk and
[43:28] honey
[43:29] only rebel not against jehovah neither
[43:33] fear ye the land
[43:35] neither fear ye the people of the land
[43:37] for they are bred for us
[43:39] their defense is removed from over them
[43:42] and jehovah is with us fear them not
[43:46] and i have a feeling
[43:47] i was just pondering this all week
[43:50] i texted pastor and told me i want to
[43:51] sing this and i was pondering this verse
[43:54] and i have a feeling that joshua and
[43:56] caleb
[43:57] knew what report they were going to give
[43:59] before they even left
[44:01] before they even came back you know
[44:03] before they were sent they they knew the
[44:05] word of the lord and they went in with
[44:06] faith
[44:08] you know and that's how we have to be
[44:10] you know our battle starts
[44:13] when we enter the land
[44:15] and that's when their battle started and
[44:17] they didn't care i don't think that they
[44:19] would have mattered even if the report
[44:21] was that they were grasshoppers i feel
[44:23] like joshua and caleb would have said
[44:24] the same thing
[44:26] you know and then
[44:29] this thing about giants i was reading in
[44:32] samuel as well and david
[44:34] goliath wasn't the only giant that david
[44:36] and his men killed
[44:38] he had more than one giant to kill
[44:41] and samuel 21 22 second samuel 21 22
[44:45] says these four warriors were descended
[44:47] from the giant in gath and they fail by
[44:49] the hands of david and his servants
[44:53] and i feel like i've had giants to fight
[44:55] in my life and i feel like we all have
[44:57] and i'll just like to encourage you to
[45:00] keep pressing on and keep fighting
[45:19] [Music]
[45:23] so
[45:26] [Music]
[45:44] for battle
[45:48] [Music]
[45:57] [Music]
[45:58] for
[45:59] [Music]
[46:11] you're an army just

[46:28] [Music]

[50:25] [Music]
[50:28] oh
[50:32] [Music]
[50:39] [Music]
[50:55] hallelujah
[50:57] [Music]
[50:59] hallelujah
[51:02] just a little softer
[51:05] i want to tell you something while they
[51:07] just keep the beat just keep that going
[51:08] just a minute
[51:10] david didn't tell you this
[51:12] but he was scheduled to
[51:14] be gone
[51:16] with ashley for a few days
[51:18] holiday for texas
[51:20] and they have to take it when ashley can
[51:22] get it
[51:23] and he was so
[51:25] convinced
[51:27] that he was supposed to sing this song
[51:29] that they canceled their vacation trip
[51:32] to texas
[51:34] there's a whole other story that we
[51:35] won't get into but the enemy really
[51:37] fought them in another way
[51:39] to discourage them
[51:41] they thought well i'll just tell it
[51:43] they thought well we'll go camping for a
[51:44] couple days
[51:46] and they get out on the highway and one
[51:47] of the horses they call dogs jumped out
[51:50] of the jumped out of the vehicle and
[51:52] ended up
[51:53] fracturing a part of his leg and will
[51:56] have perhaps have to have surgery
[51:58] so i believe that that kind of proves to
[52:01] us
[52:02] that he was being obedient we've been
[52:04] talking about radical obedience
[52:06] now i don't read this lightly
[52:09] but this is a scripture here that is
[52:11] baffling to me
[52:13] but i believe the lord wants me to read
[52:15] it into the atmosphere
[52:17] this is psalm 74
[52:23] hallelujah
[52:27] psalm 74.
[52:32] god is my king verse 12
[52:34] for god is my king of old
[52:37] working salvation in the midst of the
[52:39] earth
[52:40] thou didst divide the sea
[52:42] by thy strength
[52:44] thou breakest the heads of the dragons
[52:47] in the waters
[52:49] thou breakest the heads of leviathan
[52:52] in pieces
[52:54] and gave us him to be meat to the people
[52:58] inhabiting the wilderness sing it again
[53:07] [Music]
[53:18] so
[53:19] [Music]
[53:27] [Music]
[53:30] you're an army
[53:36] [Music]
[53:44] you're an army
[53:48] [Music]
[53:58] oh
[54:02] [Music]
[54:32] [Applause]
[54:36] [Music]
[54:43] is
[54:48] [Music]
[55:02] we got off the giant
[55:08] foreign
[55:15] [Music]
[55:26] [Music]
[55:35] [Laughter]
[55:47] [Music]
[55:50] me
[55:58] [Music]
[56:02] foreign
[56:05] [Music]
[56:10] [Applause]
[56:10] [Music]
[56:16] take the land
[56:17] [Music]
[56:19] take the land
[56:23] take the land
[56:31] you see
[56:33] i
[56:34] i believe what the lord is saying is
[56:35] that leviathan in the bible it's the
[56:38] same same kind of intimidating spirit
[56:41] that was on those giants and you know
[56:44] leviathan represents a twisting spirit
[56:48] that twists the truth that tries to
[56:50] pervert the truth and i believe i heard
[56:53] the lord saying that what was meant to
[56:55] take you under
[56:58] [Music]
[57:00] what the enemy has sent to take you
[57:02] under god's gonna give you the victory
[57:04] over it
[57:06] if you'll just claim it i don't care
[57:08] what it is
[57:09] i don't care if it's depression or
[57:11] suicide or some kind of sickness or
[57:14] lying spirit or some kind of addiction
[57:16] or doesn't matter what it is i believe
[57:18] the lord is saying that what the enemy
[57:21] intended to take you under god's going
[57:24] to let you stand on top take that
[57:27] victory that belongs to us it's ours
[57:32] it's ours
[57:33] [Applause]
[57:38] hallelujah hallelujah
[57:41] [Applause]
[57:44] praise the lord
[57:47] hallelujah
[57:50] hallelujah
[57:53] good job david
[57:55] thank you for sharing that with us
[57:58] and we're thankful to the lord that he's
[58:00] got it
[58:02] and he's put us right in the middle
[58:04] of this battle
[58:06] and he gave us all of the armor that we
[58:08] need to cut off the giant's head
[58:11] amen you may have your seats once again
[58:13] today
[58:16] we're going to receive the tithe and the
[58:18] offering
[58:19] part of our worship unto the lord
[58:23] the tithe belongs to him and then he
[58:26] offers to us
[58:28] a declaration to prove him
[58:32] by giving of our tithe and offering
[58:35] and we want to do exactly that we're
[58:38] demonstrating to him that he is our
[58:40] provider and he demonstrates to us that
[58:43] he is
[58:44] and so we want to give of our tithe and
[58:47] offering today
[58:49] we want to
[58:50] thank you that as of right now
[58:53] you have given two hundred and thirty
[58:54] eight thousand five hundred and twenty
[58:57] four dollars and seventy eight cents
[58:59] toward the mortgage of this property
[59:01] toward the principle of the mortgage of
[59:03] this property we want to thank the lord
[59:06] for that
[59:11] now
[59:12] while i was away i was told a pastor
[59:14] told me
[59:16] that there was a man that he knew
[59:20] that
[59:21] had bought a business for a million
[59:22] dollars
[59:24] and he worked it for several years
[59:26] and he sold it for four million dollars
[59:29] and he paid off this pastor's house and
[59:32] he paid off the church
[59:34] i believe
[59:36] that by our obedience we're going to see
[59:39] the same kinds of things
[59:41] i believe this
[59:43] so i thank you that you have pressed in
[59:46] with us
[59:47] the the mortgage renews next month uh
[59:50] and so we are still
[59:52] giving to this if you have anything that
[59:55] you want to give you can give it at any
[59:56] time we will again take an offering on i
[1:00:00] believe it's the 4th
[1:00:02] of september
[1:00:03] but we're just going to receive the
[1:00:05] tithing offering today and allow you to
[1:00:07] give as unto the lord while i'm
[1:00:09] mentioning this
[1:00:12] there has been an event that has been
[1:00:14] put in motion for labor day weekend and
[1:00:16] i'm calling for laborers on labor day
[1:00:19] weekend
[1:00:21] brother joshiantis has already put in
[1:00:23] motion
[1:00:24] the equipment that is needed so that we
[1:00:26] can get the water
[1:00:28] rerouted to quit running across the
[1:00:31] asphalt parking lot all those red stains
[1:00:34] that you see because the ditches have
[1:00:36] filled up with sediment and so forth and
[1:00:39] it's already been put in motion the
[1:00:41] equipment has been
[1:00:43] donated
[1:00:44] as long as joshua is operating it and we
[1:00:48] want to thank the lord for that but we
[1:00:50] need laborers that sometimes you can
[1:00:52] look like a state worker just leaning on
[1:00:54] a shovel but there'll be other times
[1:00:56] that he's going to need you to operate
[1:00:58] that shovel so he doesn't have to get on
[1:01:00] and off the equipment so if you are a a
[1:01:04] man in this church and you can help us
[1:01:06] on
[1:01:08] saturday maybe starting friday night i
[1:01:10] don't know but saturday and monday of
[1:01:12] that weekend we would surely appreciate
[1:01:14] it and if you sisters that may bring us
[1:01:16] lunch to uh so that we don't have to
[1:01:20] run off we can eat something kind of
[1:01:22] light and keep right on working but we
[1:01:24] want to
[1:01:25] everything for that event has been paid
[1:01:28] for so that's taken care of all right so
[1:01:30] we just want to thank the lord for that
[1:01:35] as soon as we know that that is taken
[1:01:37] care of by god's grace we would like to
[1:01:40] be able to get money together before
[1:01:43] camp meeting to have this the surface of
[1:01:45] this parking lot
[1:01:46] redone and repainted i'm looking to the
[1:01:49] lord to provide for that i'm looking for
[1:01:52] the lord to do that

[1:07:27] sorry
[1:07:28] someone is calling me from africa and i
[1:07:30] accidentally accepted the call
[1:07:34] so i'm i've just rudely deleted
[1:07:37] so i didn't mean to do that i wasn't
[1:07:39] sure exactly how to handle that but
[1:07:41] anyway
[1:07:42] uh our baby turned 16 yesterday and our
[1:07:46] oldest turns
[1:07:47] 24 today
[1:07:49] and this is his first birthday as a
[1:07:51] married man
[1:07:52] and he looks like he's managing it
[1:07:54] pretty good and and jenna they're making
[1:07:57] it so
[1:07:58] uh happy birthday to him
[1:08:00] i know all you parents feel the same way
[1:08:03] it seems like yesterday
[1:08:05] you know when our kids were little
[1:08:08] all the seniors and older ones sorry
[1:08:11] brother can't talk
[1:08:13] uh all the seniors and the older ones
[1:08:16] would come over to the table in the
[1:08:17] restaurant and they would say you know
[1:08:19] hug them love them while they're little
[1:08:22] you know they're going to grow up so
[1:08:24] fast and that would kind of get on my
[1:08:26] nerves at times
[1:08:28] you know it would just just constantly
[1:08:30] they're saying that you better love them
[1:08:32] now they're going to grow up it's going
[1:08:34] to go by so quick
[1:08:36] but in that moment you're so you're so
[1:08:38] thrilled and you you don't even want to
[1:08:40] think about them growing up
[1:08:42] and you know what now i'm that person
[1:08:45] now i go around to the tables when i see
[1:08:48] a sweet little family and i say hold
[1:08:50] them tight they grow so fast
[1:08:54] and it's just the truth you know as
[1:08:56] parents we only get one opportunity
[1:08:59] just one chance to raise them right
[1:09:02] to raise them in church
[1:09:04] to raise them in the things of god
[1:09:06] and we can't lead them with our words
[1:09:09] we have to lead them by example
[1:09:12] so may god strengthen every parent
[1:09:15] to do just that because the the hour is
[1:09:17] short we we are certainly approaching
[1:09:20] the coming of the lord
[1:09:22] i i wanted also to
[1:09:24] to say that on tuesday of this week is
[1:09:27] ashley's birthday and she was playing
[1:09:29] the piano isn't it wonderful to see her
[1:09:32] stepping up into her talent and helping
[1:09:34] like she did this morning god bless you
[1:09:40] it's also brother richard ellsworth's
[1:09:42] birthday on tuesday and we still love
[1:09:45] him and we miss him and we pray for him
[1:09:49] and it's also the lewis's
[1:09:51] wedding anniversary brother donovan and
[1:09:54] sister audrey and i i haven't told you
[1:09:57] all but
[1:09:58] uh
[1:09:59] maybe we made some mention of it but
[1:10:01] brother donovan was on his way to texas
[1:10:04] for benjamin and jenna's wedding
[1:10:06] and i don't know if you know this or not
[1:10:08] but his motor blew up on his car
[1:10:12] and he called from shreveport
[1:10:14] and he said pastor i i've been out on
[1:10:16] the highway all day stranded and
[1:10:19] and there's no way i'm going to make it
[1:10:21] to the wedding i'm just trying to figure
[1:10:22] out how to get home
[1:10:24] and uh
[1:10:25] you know it was just a real a real
[1:10:28] interesting thing god sent two men
[1:10:30] finally to
[1:10:31] to pick him up and take him to their
[1:10:34] home
[1:10:35] and give him a little something to eat
[1:10:37] and some refreshment and let him use the
[1:10:39] phone and you know that just this seems
[1:10:42] like that don't happen that often these
[1:10:43] days
[1:10:44] he began to talk to him about coming out
[1:10:46] for the wedding and disappointed he
[1:10:48] wouldn't get to be there and he began to
[1:10:51] testify to him about the lord and the
[1:10:53] next thing you know he tells them about
[1:10:55] our ministry and the app and he's
[1:10:57] watching them download the app
[1:11:00] you know you don't ever know why people
[1:11:02] meet the way they do
[1:11:03] but you know we really it really
[1:11:05] bothered us and we went to prayer and we
[1:11:07] began to say to brother donovan we're
[1:11:09] going to believe god to make this thing
[1:11:11] right well i want you to know it was
[1:11:13] eventually made right he had to wait a
[1:11:16] while to get it made right but it has
[1:11:18] now been made right
[1:11:20] and uh kia
[1:11:22] the dealership there working with the
[1:11:24] manufacturer they they flew brother
[1:11:26] donovan back to shreveport to pick up a
[1:11:29] vehicle put a brand new motor in that
[1:11:32] vehicle under warranty and he said
[1:11:34] brother shelly that vehicle drives
[1:11:36] better than it did when it was brand new
[1:11:39] so you know god took care of that
[1:11:41] he took care of that for him
[1:11:44] he was so happy
[1:11:46] oh
[1:11:47] my
[1:11:49] that's just the goodness of the lord
[1:11:51] we haven't seen brother matthew and

[1:13:46] a host of people i i couldn't take the
[1:13:48] time to call the nations that are
[1:13:50] represented here this morning but if i'm
[1:13:52] looking right there's there's over 25
[1:13:55] nations that are represented in the
[1:13:57] stream just a handful of us here but
[1:14:01] several handfuls across the nations
[1:14:03] watching the service and we are thankful
[1:14:05] for that god is just good isn't he
[1:14:08] would you turn in your bible to second
[1:14:10] corinthians chapter 10
[1:14:13] i want to begin reading in verse 4
[1:14:17] and i don't want to disappoint anybody
[1:14:19] but the the spirit of god just arrested
[1:14:21] me over the weekend and
[1:14:24] and i i'm not able to go forward in what
[1:14:26] we were starting but we will as soon as
[1:14:28] we have the release of the lord to do so
[1:14:32] we will do some more teaching on the
[1:14:33] gifts of the spirit
[1:14:35] and specifically
[1:14:37] uh the administration of the gift of of
[1:14:40] tongues
[1:14:41] we know that god uses these things
[1:14:45] and we believe in them
[1:14:47] and we just want what god wants
[1:14:50] you know there are a lot of churches
[1:14:51] that believe that all these things are
[1:14:53] over with but but my bible tells me that
[1:14:56] jesus christ is the same yesterday
[1:14:59] and today and forever it says he changes
[1:15:01] not
[1:15:02] and if god ever did it he's still able
[1:15:04] to do it today he still heals the sick
[1:15:07] how many of you has ever healed your
[1:15:09] body you know i mean he's baffled the
[1:15:11] doctors for some of you in your life the
[1:15:14] doctors say i have no explanation
[1:15:17] there's sister beth back there dead on
[1:15:19] the table and god gave her her life back
[1:15:23] so she's going to tell you that he's
[1:15:24] still a healer
[1:15:26] and you just put your trust in him and
[1:15:28] it'll be all right
[1:15:30] but the lord wouldn't let me go any
[1:15:32] further and i'm going to go back into
[1:15:34] at least one service today on a subject
[1:15:37] that that i think will be helpful to you
[1:15:41] if you were here when we brought it
[1:15:43] originally uh let me ask you this has
[1:15:46] anybody ever seen a an episode of andy
[1:15:49] griffith more than one time
[1:15:52] oh my goodness
[1:15:54] my children
[1:15:55] memorized them
[1:15:58] you'd have to tell them to hush because
[1:16:00] they'd be doing barney's lines you know
[1:16:03] or or the waltons or little house on the
[1:16:06] prairie
[1:16:07] we've turned the lights off at night and
[1:16:10] said good night john boy you know
[1:16:13] and so if you've ever
[1:16:14] how many of you have ever had a film
[1:16:16] watched a film more than once a movie
[1:16:18] more than one time all right so you
[1:16:20] don't have anything to complain about
[1:16:23] that i'm going to go back and give you a
[1:16:25] little bit of the word that i have
[1:16:26] already shared with you
[1:16:28] second corinthians chapter 10 verse 4
[1:16:30] for the weapons
[1:16:32] of our warfare somebody said i don't
[1:16:35] understand that warfare talk
[1:16:37] what's that boy doing up there waving a
[1:16:39] sword around and talking about eating
[1:16:40] giants
[1:16:42] that just grosses me out well we're in a
[1:16:44] warfare
[1:16:46] there's a battle that's raging between
[1:16:48] the forces of good and the forces of
[1:16:51] evil and i got good news for you church
[1:16:54] the little bride of jesus christ she
[1:16:56] wins
[1:16:58] she wins
[1:17:00] if you don't believe that read
[1:17:01] revelation 19
[1:17:03] we're coming back with him one day the
[1:17:05] scripture said so for the weapons of our
[1:17:07] warfare are not carnal but mighty
[1:17:10] through god
[1:17:12] to the pulling down
[1:17:14] of
[1:17:14] strongholds
[1:17:16] casting down imaginations
[1:17:20] and every high
[1:17:22] thing has your imagination ever run wild
[1:17:26] you know it's not a curse to have a
[1:17:28] vivid
[1:17:29] active imagination
[1:17:31] but it has to be sanctified
[1:17:34] because that imagination will take you
[1:17:36] to all kinds of places you don't need to
[1:17:38] go
[1:17:40] right
[1:17:41] this is why pornography's stealing our
[1:17:43] nation
[1:17:44] that's why it's plaguing our churches
[1:17:47] that's why it's destroying marriages
[1:17:50] because people haven't learned to
[1:17:51] sanctify their imagination and they're
[1:17:54] letting fantasy take them right into the
[1:17:56] very dregs of sin
[1:17:58] you've got to sanctify your imagination
[1:18:01] you've got to live in reality you can't
[1:18:04] live in that video game all the time
[1:18:06] anybody going to say amen
[1:18:08] you got to live in reality the word of
[1:18:10] god casting down imaginations and every
[1:18:14] high thing that exalteth itself against
[1:18:16] the knowledge of god and bringing into
[1:18:19] captivity i want to hear you help me
[1:18:21] with that next those next two words i
[1:18:23] want to hear you say them
[1:18:27] every
[1:18:29] every thought
[1:18:30] that's all all means all that's all
[1:18:34] every one of them
[1:18:36] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:18:40] the obedience of christ
[1:18:42] you crazy thought
[1:18:44] you are going to bow your need
[1:18:47] to the sovereignty of jesus christ when
[1:18:50] the enemy lies to me i'm going to have
[1:18:52] to grab a hold of that
[1:18:54] and wrestle that down
[1:18:56] and submit it and subject it to the
[1:19:00] truth of jesus christ
[1:19:02] bringing into air into captivity every
[1:19:04] thought to the obedience of christ and
[1:19:07] having
[1:19:08] in a readiness
[1:19:10] to revenge
[1:19:12] all disobedience
[1:19:15] but that's not all
[1:19:18] it says when your obedience is fulfilled
[1:19:24] you better make sure you're obeying the
[1:19:26] lord before you call someone else into
[1:19:28] accountability
[1:19:29] come on now
[1:19:31] we're not judging one another's motives
[1:19:33] in this hour
[1:19:34] it's not our place
[1:19:36] we can we can judge behaviors
[1:19:39] but we can't judge motives
[1:19:41] when jesus said judge not that you be
[1:19:43] not judged you look at that in the greek
[1:19:45] he is telling you you cannot tell what's
[1:19:48] in somebody else's heart
[1:19:50] and when you think you can tell what's
[1:19:52] in somebody else's heart you're you're
[1:19:54] absolutely going against the
[1:19:56] commandments of jesus christ now i want
[1:19:58] to give you one more verse before you're
[1:20:00] seated and they don't have it i didn't
[1:20:02] give it to them but i want to read
[1:20:03] galatians 5
[1:20:06] and verse 1.
[1:20:09] i thought of it while i was here on the
[1:20:10] platform and i i grabbed my bible
[1:20:14] and they got it quicker than i could
[1:20:15] even find it here
[1:20:17] it says stand fast
[1:20:22] stand fast therefore
[1:20:24] in the liberty somebody say liberty
[1:20:27] we're with christ have made us
[1:20:30] free and be
[1:20:33] not entangled again
[1:20:36] with the yoke of bondage
[1:20:38] i want to read it all again
[1:20:40] stand fast
[1:20:42] therefore in the liberty
[1:20:45] where with christ have made us free
[1:20:49] i want to know if i'm preaching to any
[1:20:51] free people here today
[1:20:53] no longer slaves
[1:20:55] free
[1:20:57] why because of the blood of jesus christ
[1:21:00] no longer slaves to sin why because of
[1:21:03] the blood of jesus christ redeemed how
[1:21:06] why by the blood of jesus christ not by
[1:21:09] my goodness
[1:21:10] not my by my works
[1:21:13] but only by the blood
[1:21:15] of jesus stand fast therefore in the
[1:21:17] liberty wherewith christ hath made us
[1:21:20] free and be not entangled again
[1:21:25] with the yoke of bondage how many of you
[1:21:28] can see that old yolk that they were
[1:21:31] putting on the ox in years gone by
[1:21:33] driving them into the field that old
[1:21:36] heavy heavy log
[1:21:38] laid across their shoulder
[1:21:40] i'm telling you that's a heavy burden to

[1:23:20] son
[1:23:21] sets free is what
[1:23:24] free indeed that doesn't mean just a
[1:23:26] little bit free
[1:23:27] free indeed is an ultimate freedom
[1:23:31] you don't have to be a slave to anybody
[1:23:35] or anything
[1:23:37] there are people that we bump into every
[1:23:40] day in our lives that are slaves
[1:23:45] they're slaves to something they're
[1:23:48] driven by something or by somebody and
[1:23:52] because of the blood of jesus
[1:23:55] you do not have to be a slave to your
[1:23:58] emotions
[1:23:59] you don't have to be a slave to your
[1:24:01] thoughts
[1:24:02] you don't have to be a slave to your
[1:24:04] imagination
[1:24:06] you don't have to be a slave to your
[1:24:08] circumstances
[1:24:10] you don't have to be a slave to
[1:24:12] addictions
[1:24:13] or habits
[1:24:14] he whom the son sets free
[1:24:17] is free indeed
[1:24:18] you can have a clean mind
[1:24:21] you don't have to live in the gutter
[1:24:24] you don't have to live in the fantasy of
[1:24:26] pornography i'm going to hit it again
[1:24:29] you can live in reality
[1:24:31] god can give you a satisfaction in your
[1:24:34] sex life
[1:24:35] if you're a married person that you
[1:24:37] don't have to dig into that filth
[1:24:40] and if you're a single person the lord
[1:24:42] can give you the victory that you need
[1:24:45] to possess your vessel in sanctification
[1:24:48] there's no good excuse for pornography
[1:24:55] it it binds people
[1:24:58] it pushes people with guilt
[1:25:01] and with condemnation
[1:25:03] you do not have to be a slave to
[1:25:06] inferiority complexes
[1:25:11] you don't have to be a slave to any
[1:25:13] complex
[1:25:15] you don't have to be paranoid that
[1:25:17] everybody hates you
[1:25:19] let me tell you something somebody does
[1:25:23] you're living in la la land if you think
[1:25:26] everybody likes you
[1:25:30] preach brother
[1:25:32] everybody don't like you
[1:25:35] i don't care how likable you are
[1:25:37] somebody don't like you
[1:25:39] so you just need to go ahead and accept
[1:25:41] that and keep walking on for jesus
[1:25:45] come on
[1:25:46] you're not waiting on somebody to like
[1:25:48] you or to give you their vote of
[1:25:50] approval for you to serve the lord
[1:25:52] you're just going to serve him because
[1:25:54] he's been so good to you
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:25:58] and you're going to tell somebody
[1:26:00] because you just can't keep it to
[1:26:02] yourself
[1:26:04] and you know you're not going to be
[1:26:05] haughty you're not going to be arrogant
[1:26:08] but you need to sometimes make up your
[1:26:10] mind if if he doesn't like me that's his
[1:26:12] problem
[1:26:15] he don't want my fellowship that's his
[1:26:17] problem
[1:26:19] i don't mean to get arrogant i don't
[1:26:20] think you should get haughty
[1:26:22] but sometimes you just have to say
[1:26:24] that's her loss
[1:26:28] somebody said don't that sound a little
[1:26:29] hot it can so don't get under that
[1:26:33] don't act like you're somebody
[1:26:35] because without him none of us
[1:26:40] we're not worth the salt papa used to
[1:26:42] say they're not worth a salt on their
[1:26:44] bread
[1:26:46] you're not worth a salt on your bread if
[1:26:48] you don't know jesus christ
[1:26:50] your life is a wreck
[1:26:52] without him
[1:26:53] now i'm not talking about sunday
[1:26:55] religion
[1:26:56] i'm not talking about christmas and
[1:26:58] easter religion
[1:27:00] i'm talking about a day-to-day salvation
[1:27:03] a day-to-day walk of redemption and talk
[1:27:05] about surrendering your life to the lord
[1:27:08] every single day
[1:27:10] desiring to please him
[1:27:12] you don't have to be a slave to anger
[1:27:19] you don't have to live in a house with
[1:27:21] holes in the wall
[1:27:25] because you can't control your anger
[1:27:27] hello
[1:27:29] you can be free
[1:27:30] i don't want to live in that you don't
[1:27:32] have to mistreat your wife
[1:27:37] you women don't have to abuse your
[1:27:38] husbands
[1:27:43] i'm just going to drink me some water up
[1:27:45] in here
[1:27:51] because we're free
[1:27:53] the blood of jesus frees us
[1:27:57] you don't have to be a slave to your
[1:27:59] past
[1:28:02] who is that
[1:28:03] i don't even know who that man was
[1:28:06] who are you talking to me i don't even
[1:28:08] remember that guy
[1:28:09] hallelujah all things have passed away
[1:28:12] paul said behold all things
[1:28:16] have become new that's what jesus is
[1:28:19] doing in people's lives
[1:28:22] you're sitting in a church today where
[1:28:24] there are former hookers
[1:28:27] where there are former drug addicts
[1:28:30] where there are former alcoholics
[1:28:33] i don't want to go any further
[1:28:36] but let me tell you some more than that
[1:28:38] is represented
[1:28:40] except for the fact that
[1:28:42] those people don't exist
[1:28:46] anymore
[1:28:50] there are testimonies in this room right
[1:28:52] now that can never be told
[1:28:55] i know some
[1:28:56] oh that makes me want to jump off this
[1:28:59] platform and fly
[1:29:01] that's what jesus can do
[1:29:04] he can save you from such a wrecked
[1:29:07] filthy
[1:29:08] life that you can't even tell anybody
[1:29:12] how far he's brought you because you
[1:29:14] don't want to run the risk of of
[1:29:17] hindering them
[1:29:19] in their relationship i don't believe in
[1:29:21] glamorizing sin
[1:29:24] i used to tell some of the old preachers
[1:29:26] that would get up and tell about their
[1:29:28] moonshine days and their and their
[1:29:30] thunder road days
[1:29:32] running from the law
[1:29:35] and and i'd say to them come on fellers
[1:29:39] i even spoke to spoke to bootlegging
[1:29:41] billy andrews one time
[1:29:43] and i said brother billy you ought to
[1:29:45] see them kids on the front row when you
[1:29:47] talk about running from the law
[1:29:50] their eyes get big and it sounds like
[1:29:54] excitement i want you to know there's no
[1:29:56] excitement in having to look over your
[1:29:58] back everywhere you go
[1:30:00] afraid that somebody you've done wrong
[1:30:02] is going to blow your head off
[1:30:04] there's no freedom in the hat
[1:30:06] there are people in this room and
[1:30:08] represented on this stream that have
[1:30:10] been in gangs
[1:30:12] that have run guns
[1:30:15] that have run drugs
[1:30:17] or you're just making this up i'm not
[1:30:21] there are people represented here that
[1:30:23] have touched things they should have
[1:30:25] never touched
[1:30:26] taken things they should have never
[1:30:28] taken
[1:30:30] said things they should have never said
[1:30:32] come on but we are not those men and
[1:30:36] women anymore
[1:30:38] because we are freed by the blood of the
[1:30:42] lamb
[1:30:43] saved by the blood
[1:30:46] we're not who we are because we join the
[1:30:49] church
[1:30:51] because church will fail you
[1:30:54] preachers will fail you
[1:30:56] pastors will fail you
[1:30:59] sunday school teachers will fail you
[1:31:02] denominational structures will fail you
[1:31:05] but jesus never
[1:31:08] never
[1:31:09] ever
[1:31:10] fails
[1:31:12] hallelujah
[1:31:13] he will never make you a promise that he
[1:31:15] can't keep
[1:31:17] if he said it whether you believe it or
[1:31:19] not
[1:31:20] if he said it it's true
[1:31:22] it settles it he's just as alive today
[1:31:26] as he was in mary's womb
[1:31:29] he's just as alive today as when he
[1:31:31] raised the dead
[1:31:33] when he called lazarus from the grave
[1:31:35] after his body was already stinking and
[1:31:37] rottening he's just as alive and able
[1:31:40] today to heal and to help and to bless
[1:31:42] as he was when he walked the shores of
[1:31:45] galilee and cleansed the leper and
[1:31:47] caused blind eyes to be open
[1:31:50] he's the same god
[1:31:52] and he is not a god of eternity he's not
[1:31:55] a god of somewhere out there in history
[1:31:58] he's a personal savior
[1:32:01] he's a personal god
[1:32:05] i wonder if my friend i have a friend
[1:32:07] here
[1:32:08] i mean we're not friends i don't know
[1:32:10] him but i've got somebody that's been
[1:32:12] after me a couple weeks now for yelling
[1:32:17] so i thought i'd just start off yelling
[1:32:19] today
[1:32:23] he said do you have to yell no i don't
[1:32:25] have to do a lot of things
[1:32:28] i don't have to change socks but it
[1:32:29] feels good
[1:32:33] i don't have to shower every day but it
[1:32:34] feels good and
[1:32:38] sometimes it just feels good to let it
[1:32:41] out
[1:32:43] brother sister he has been so good to me
[1:32:48] i could never tell at all
[1:32:52] he reached down and comforted my heart
[1:32:55] in my childhood watching my mother be
[1:32:58] physically abused
[1:33:00] and running at times for our life and
[1:33:03] the goodness of god protected me and
[1:33:06] kept me he filled me with the holy ghost
[1:33:09] when i was seven years old and he kept
[1:33:12] me from a life of sin
[1:33:15] i only ever had to punch one person in
[1:33:17] my life
[1:33:21] aren't i blessed
[1:33:23] only had to and i was already preaching
[1:33:25] the gospel when i did that
[1:33:27] oh i can hear the critics now
[1:33:30] let me come see if any of them typing to
[1:33:32] me
[1:33:34] i did
[1:33:34] i i was in i was in school
[1:33:38] and this
[1:33:39] i i i would i would call his name but he
[1:33:42] might see this
[1:33:44] because we're friends on facebook
[1:33:50] he and i
[1:33:52] we're friends with
[1:33:54] big hurt frank thomas
[1:33:56] i'll call frank's name
[1:33:59] some of you might know him if you don't
[1:34:01] you can look it up he was a sports star
[1:34:05] and this young man
[1:34:07] we were mutual friends
[1:34:09] i was of a different race as either one
[1:34:11] of them but we nothing mattered you know
[1:34:15] and this
[1:34:16] guy decided that he was gonna
[1:34:19] he was gonna have me to take a pill
[1:34:23] he said you can't even say you have
[1:34:25] experienced life
[1:34:27] until you have
[1:34:30] tried what is out there and he was going
[1:34:32] to force me to
[1:34:33] and he harassed me
[1:34:35] and he made fun of me
[1:34:37] and he laughed at me
[1:34:39] and he pushed at me and he caught me one
[1:34:42] day in the bathroom in school
[1:34:44] and he said i'm you are too he said i've
[1:34:46] got a i got a bottle here and you're
[1:34:48] going and
[1:34:49] i want you to know the truth is i'm
[1:34:51] embarrassed to tell this i better get
[1:34:53] out of the pulpit to tell it
[1:34:55] i've closed my eyes
[1:34:58] and i said lord jesus
[1:35:00] help me to knock him out
[1:35:11] and you know what
[1:35:13] he did
[1:35:17] when i realized that he was unconscious
[1:35:24] i throwed myself down on the dirty
[1:35:26] bathroom floor and started praying lord
[1:35:29] jesus help him oh god
[1:35:33] oh lord
[1:35:35] i didn't mean to kill him
[1:35:40] he began to arrive come true like this
[1:35:43] we
[1:35:44] we shook hands
[1:35:47] they called us down to the principal's
[1:35:49] office
[1:35:50] and i had an unfair advantage
[1:35:53] because my principal's name was mr
[1:35:55] jenkins and i had won him to the lord
[1:36:03] he had called me to his office to pray
[1:36:05] the sinner's prayer with him
[1:36:08] because i had spent some time witnessing
[1:36:10] to him and his wife
[1:36:12] my teacher at the time had been to my
[1:36:15] revivals where i was preaching because i
[1:36:17] started preaching at seven
[1:36:19] and she had been her name was mrs fike
[1:36:22] it hasn't been too long ago i saw her at
[1:36:25] at olive garden but she's getting on up
[1:36:27] there in years
[1:36:28] when it come time to go down to the
[1:36:30] office
[1:36:31] my my buddy walking with me the boy i
[1:36:34] just knocked out
[1:36:36] we're walking down side by side and he
[1:36:37] said this is not fair
[1:36:39] he said because the principal likes you
[1:36:41] better than he does me
[1:36:44] and i said well the truth is you had no
[1:36:46] business treating me that way you know i
[1:36:48] took it and took it and took it and took
[1:36:50] it until i couldn't take it no more he
[1:36:52] said i don't even blame you
[1:36:57] that's my one big fight
[1:36:59] we get to the principal's office he goes
[1:37:01] in first
[1:37:02] he comes out and he looks at me and he
[1:37:04] says i'm i'm suspended
[1:37:07] he said i'm out for three days
[1:37:09] he said i think he's gonna do the same
[1:37:11] to you i said that's all right
[1:37:13] i can take three days at home that's not
[1:37:15] gonna be no problem for me
[1:37:17] i went in there and mr jenkins said
[1:37:20] steve shelly
[1:37:24] he said i'm embarrassed son
[1:37:28] he said i can't believe you let him push
[1:37:30] you like that i said sir i can't either
[1:37:34] i said but just to my defense
[1:37:37] i i prayed as sincere for him to come
[1:37:40] back to consciousness
[1:37:42] as i have ever prayed for anybody in my
[1:37:44] life
[1:37:45] mr jenkins cackled and he said i'm sure
[1:37:47] you did he said now i cannot have you
[1:37:51] knocking people out in my school
[1:37:55] but he said just go right on back to
[1:37:57] class and don't ever let it happen again
[1:38:03] when i walked out jeff
[1:38:05] somebody's parents
[1:38:08] were picking them up
[1:38:10] and he looked at me and he said you
[1:38:12] buzzard
[1:38:14] he said you're going back to class
[1:38:15] aren't you i said
[1:38:20] three days later he come back
[1:38:22] and we were the best of friends until i
[1:38:24] went to another school in high school
[1:38:26] you know god was good to me
[1:38:29] this is not just a career choice for me
[1:38:32] this is a lifestyle
[1:38:34] i i don't i don't have the same
[1:38:37] testimony that some of you have of how
[1:38:39] god delivered you from this or that or
[1:38:42] the other but i can testify that the
[1:38:45] same god who reaches way below the
[1:38:48] bottom to deliver and to save is the
[1:38:52] same god who filled me with his spirit
[1:38:55] and who kept me
[1:38:57] from making many many many stupid
[1:38:59] decisions along the way that's the god
[1:39:01] we serve
[1:39:03] that's the god we serve i want you to
[1:39:05] know he did everything for us
[1:39:09] all we have to do is with faith believe
[1:39:13] that it's a finished work
[1:39:15] the blood has forgiven all of our sins
[1:39:19] he has delivered us from all oppression
[1:39:22] but we have a choice to make
[1:39:24] and that is a decision to walk in
[1:39:27] freedom
[1:39:29] freedom is a gift
[1:39:31] but to walk to continue to abide free
[1:39:35] or with liberty
[1:39:37] is a conscious decision
[1:39:39] that you and i have to make on a
[1:39:40] continual basis
[1:39:42] if god has set you free from a complex
[1:39:45] you have to choose
[1:39:46] to stay away from that complex
[1:39:49] don't ever let the enemy take you into
[1:39:51] entanglement with that same thing again
[1:39:53] how do i do that by making up my mind to
[1:39:56] recognize the tricks of the enemy
[1:39:59] we are not ignorant of the devil's
[1:40:01] devices
[1:40:03] we know how he operates how many of you
[1:40:05] have learned enough about about how the
[1:40:07] enemy operates in your life you know him
[1:40:09] when he comes
[1:40:11] you know him when he shows up
[1:40:13] and if you'll always live on guard
[1:40:17] you're always live ready to pull down
[1:40:19] your imagination and to subject every
[1:40:22] thought
[1:40:23] to the obedience of christ then you can
[1:40:26] walk in freedom from lying
[1:40:28] you can walk in freedom from addiction
[1:40:31] you don't have to be a slave to your
[1:40:33] past
[1:40:34] you don't have to be a slave to the
[1:40:35] guilt of your past or the condemnation
[1:40:38] of your past you can realize i'm not
[1:40:40] that man again anymore i'm not that
[1:40:42] woman anymore now i want to give you a
[1:40:44] quotation from testimony and this was a
[1:40:47] testimony that brother branham gave of
[1:40:49] raising the dead boy
[1:40:52] and i i'd love to tell that story but we
[1:40:54] don't have time to do that this morning
[1:40:57] but i want to read this from that same
[1:40:59] message if you ever want to go back and
[1:41:02] check this message it's a good one it's
[1:41:04] 1953. that's a long time ago but the
[1:41:07] truth is just as real today as it was
[1:41:09] then
[1:41:10] he said you've got to go do it
[1:41:13] and you've got to fight
[1:41:15] for every inch
[1:41:23] it's not automatic
[1:41:26] walking in freedom
[1:41:28] walking in deliverance
[1:41:31] is not automatic
[1:41:33] god will always do his part
[1:41:36] but you have a part to play
[1:41:38] anybody with me
[1:41:39] don't get quiet yet
[1:41:41] everybody has a part to play here he
[1:41:43] said and you've got to fight for every
[1:41:46] inch of ground that you have
[1:41:50] he said every man in here that's born
[1:41:52] again of the spirit of god knows that
[1:41:56] you've had to fight for every inch of
[1:41:59] ground toe the mark with satan
[1:42:04] somebody said well i'm no match for him
[1:42:07] let me tell you something greater is he
[1:42:11] greater is he that is in you
[1:42:14] than he that is in the world
[1:42:16] without christ you are no match for
[1:42:18] satan
[1:42:20] in christ you are more than a match
[1:42:24] your anger does not have to dictate your
[1:42:27] decisions
[1:42:30] you can be out from under that
[1:42:32] but it's a day today today you know one
[1:42:36] of the biggest hindrances
[1:42:38] to walking in freedom is the spirit of
[1:42:41] religion
[1:42:46] i find it to be one of the most
[1:42:47] difficult demonic powers to deal with
[1:42:51] is the religious spirit
[1:42:53] because people will get a little bit of
[1:42:55] freedom in their life and they will want
[1:42:58] to police the church
[1:43:05] they will want to police everybody
[1:43:07] else's life
[1:43:09] come on they'll want to interview
[1:43:11] everybody to make sure they're doing
[1:43:12] like they think they ought to do and
[1:43:14] they will become so arrogant
[1:43:17] and so religious and so untouchable
[1:43:21] that they lose all connection
[1:43:24] with the grace that brought them out of
[1:43:27] their own mess
[1:43:29] if you ever forget where god brought you
[1:43:32] from
[1:43:33] you're in danger of religion
[1:43:38] when you remember that you don't have to
[1:43:40] remember the guilt you don't have to
[1:43:42] remember the condemnation you are
[1:43:45] remembering the hand that reached way
[1:43:48] below the bottom and pulled you out
[1:43:52] you must never forget how far the lord
[1:43:54] has brought you from
[1:43:56] you must remember what it was like to be
[1:43:58] angry
[1:44:00] hawk i want you to come here
[1:44:11] i'm sorry i know you'll turn red
[1:44:15] won't be the first time what'd he say
[1:44:18] what he said doesn't matter
[1:44:20] match your hair
[1:44:22] turn around
[1:44:23] i want everybody to see who you are
[1:44:25] because some have come while you over in
[1:44:27] iceland and you may not have this this
[1:44:30] this is his testimony
[1:44:32] i'm going to give this part of his
[1:44:34] testimony to you
[1:44:36] i cannot believe it
[1:44:38] if i didn't know that he was a man of
[1:44:41] truth and not a liar
[1:44:43] i would say he's a liar
[1:44:45] he tells me and has told you that will
[1:44:47] listen that he was the most angry person
[1:44:51] that he had ever met
[1:44:53] i don't believe it
[1:44:56] i do believe it
[1:44:58] because he said so
[1:45:00] and i don't believe he would lie to me
[1:45:04] but i cannot imagine
[1:45:06] him being angry
[1:45:08] oh i've seen him a little perplexed
[1:45:10] perturbed
[1:45:13] with me
[1:45:16] but not angry
[1:45:18] when the lord saved him he so gloriously
[1:45:24] so gloriously saved him that he made him
[1:45:27] a completely different person
[1:45:30] am i making this up
[1:45:32] have you not said you were the most
[1:45:34] angry person one of the most angry
[1:45:36] people you had ever met
[1:45:40] possessed with rage how old were you
[1:45:42] when you found the lord
[1:45:46] a little bit after my 20s
[1:45:48] just past his 20s i want you to thank
[1:45:51] god for hawk's life i don't want to make
[1:45:53] him stand here no more
[1:45:54] [Applause]
[1:45:57] when i met him
[1:46:02] we kid with him about being a red-headed
[1:46:04] viking
[1:46:06] because he's from iceland
[1:46:08] and when david was singing figuratively
[1:46:11] about eating giants
[1:46:15] the the past of some of those vikings
[1:46:17] was not figuratively
[1:46:19] they literally ate their enemies
[1:46:22] and so i have had a lot of fun poking
[1:46:25] with hawk because he's from iceland
[1:46:28] and when i met him i found him to be one
[1:46:31] of the most gentle and sincere men that
[1:46:34] i had ever met in my life and yet he is
[1:46:36] sitting there telling me i was possessed
[1:46:39] with rage
[1:46:41] what fixed that
[1:46:42] it wasn't counseling
[1:46:48] he didn't have a pleasant growing up
[1:46:51] experience
[1:46:53] only knew those things
[1:46:56] i don't know if i ought to tell this or
[1:46:58] not
[1:46:59] but his dad was famous
[1:47:02] in iceland
[1:47:04] for some very
[1:47:07] unsavory things
[1:47:10] you want to make the newspaper for
[1:47:12] something good you've brought into the
[1:47:13] country
[1:47:15] not for something filthy you brought
[1:47:17] into the country
[1:47:18] but when god reached down to save and
[1:47:21] deliver hawk's dad
[1:47:23] the same newspaper
[1:47:26] that packed the filth
[1:47:28] that he brought to the nation
[1:47:31] packed the story
[1:47:34] can i tell you what the headline was
[1:47:36] from porn king
[1:47:38] to king of kings
[1:47:39] [Music]
[1:47:41] is that all right to tell
[1:47:44] [Applause]
[1:47:46] who did that jesus did that
[1:47:50] jesus did that but i want you to know
[1:47:52] hulk's dad and hawk and me and you we
[1:47:56] have a decision to make we have a choice
[1:47:59] to make
[1:48:00] because it would be easy sometimes to
[1:48:02] give up and to float back into a life
[1:48:05] that god had delivered us from but we
[1:48:08] make a daily
[1:48:11] sometimes hourly decision to walk in
[1:48:15] freedom
[1:48:16] ever go back i don't ever want to go
[1:48:18] back i don't ever want to go back i
[1:48:20] refuse to go back
[1:48:23] a daily choice a choice to walk in
[1:48:27] freedom
[1:48:28] come on now
[1:48:29] it wasn't a personal relationship with
[1:48:31] benny hinn
[1:48:33] or a personal friendship with billy
[1:48:35] graham
[1:48:37] that changed those men's lives
[1:48:39] it was the lord jesus christ
[1:48:42] come on now
[1:48:44] we have folks in this ministry that
[1:48:48] ran
[1:48:49] ran with buddha
[1:48:52] they wanted peace
[1:48:55] so they ran with buddha
[1:48:57] trying to find some hope
[1:48:59] and buddha couldn't help them
[1:49:03] mushrooms couldn't help them you know
[1:49:05] what i mean i don't mean on your steak
[1:49:08] mushroom couldn't have white powder
[1:49:10] couldn't help them
[1:49:12] heroin in the veins couldn't help them
[1:49:14] and i'm telling you i know somebody
[1:49:18] i know somebody
[1:49:21] i saw on facebook where my friend aaron
[1:49:24] evans
[1:49:25] and his wife jill marie just celebrated
[1:49:28] a wedding anniversary
[1:49:30] and brother aaron was here once or twice
[1:49:32] some years ago
[1:49:34] and aaron was in prison for murdering a
[1:49:36] man
[1:49:37] and jesus walked into his jail cell
[1:49:41] somebody said i don't i don't i don't
[1:49:43] even believe it don't you think anybody
[1:49:44] asks you what you believe
[1:49:47] did you hear any of us ask you
[1:49:50] we're talking about a man that was in
[1:49:51] jail for murder and according to his
[1:49:54] testimony he was not falsely accused
[1:49:57] that's what he said
[1:49:59] i'm not down here talking bad about him
[1:50:01] he said i was not falsely accused
[1:50:05] i did what i was condemned for doing and
[1:50:07] one day jesus walked into the to the
[1:50:10] jail cell and spoke to aaron and said
[1:50:12] i'm not a black man but aaron's black
[1:50:14] he said i'm not a black man and i'm not
[1:50:16] a white man but i'm the right man you
[1:50:19] better serve me
[1:50:21] somebody said i don't even believe that
[1:50:22] i believe it because i know what jesus
[1:50:27] did in his life
[1:50:28] whoa
[1:50:30] i'm not a black man
[1:50:32] i'm not a white man
[1:50:33] he said i'm the right man you better get
[1:50:36] on your knees and serve me and aaron
[1:50:38] said yes sir
[1:50:41] i'll serve you every day of my life
[1:50:44] i'll make you the lord of my life you're
[1:50:46] the only one that can make a difference
[1:50:48] in my life come on now
[1:50:51] i know people so addicted to nicotine
[1:50:55] that they didn't just smoke a pack of
[1:50:57] cigarettes a day they smoked three
[1:50:59] cartons of cigarettes a day do you know
[1:51:01] that's enough to kill you
[1:51:04] and they didn't just do it for one one
[1:51:06] week
[1:51:09] or one month
[1:51:11] they did it for years
[1:51:13] it's a miracle beyond miracle how can
[1:51:16] anybody even consume that many
[1:51:19] cigarettes in one day three cartons
[1:51:23] literally had to have one in their hand
[1:51:26] all day long would wake up in the night
[1:51:29] to smoke
[1:51:33] now there were some that burned out in
[1:51:34] the ashtray
[1:51:36] while they were running their mouth
[1:51:39] but had one lit at all times
[1:51:41] could not be free
[1:51:44] multiple times said i'll never do it
[1:51:46] again throw them away i'll never do it
[1:51:48] again
[1:51:49] my own grandfather struggled so bad that
[1:51:52] he would get under conviction
[1:51:54] in a baptism and he would run down to
[1:51:56] the river and be baptized and would
[1:51:58] throw his cigarettes up into the woods
[1:52:00] and
[1:52:01] and a few hours later they would see him
[1:52:04] going through the leaves and the limbs
[1:52:06] trying to find that pack of cigarettes
[1:52:08] that he threw away it felt good in the
[1:52:10] moment he thought i'm doing the right
[1:52:12] thing but he was depending on the lord
[1:52:14] to do all of it
[1:52:17] and he will meet you at the point of
[1:52:19] your need and he will deliver you with
[1:52:21] his blood and he will meet you right
[1:52:23] where you are you don't have to get
[1:52:25] clean enough or holy enough or good
[1:52:28] enough he will come right down to the
[1:52:31] gutter where you are and have fellowship
[1:52:34] with you
[1:52:35] but you will have to make the choice to
[1:52:38] get out of that gutter
[1:52:40] to quit allowing the life of sin to drag
[1:52:44] you back to the pit where you once were
[1:52:46] freedom is a choice and it's going to
[1:52:48] cost you because it's going to be an
[1:52:50] everyday affair
[1:52:52] fighting
[1:52:54] toe-to-toe with satan
[1:52:56] fighting for every inch of ground that
[1:52:59] you take somebody said how do i know
[1:53:01] it's worth it it's eternal life
[1:53:05] it's the difference between heaven and
[1:53:07] hell
[1:53:09] you've got to make up your mind to fight
[1:53:11] your way through until you reach that
[1:53:14] place where these things have no hold on
[1:53:16] you and they have no pull on you i want
[1:53:18] to make sure that everyone hears me
[1:53:20] today i believe there's a place we find
[1:53:22] in christ
[1:53:24] where we have total deliverance
[1:53:28] where we no longer have to fight against
[1:53:30] the same spirits
[1:53:31] and the same lies and the same habits we
[1:53:34] walk out in freedom and we choose to
[1:53:37] remain in freedom
[1:53:38] and god strengthens our decision you
[1:53:41] don't have to make this decision by
[1:53:42] yourself he will strengthen your
[1:53:44] decision if you'll lean on him
[1:53:47] anybody here
[1:53:48] all right i want to read this to you in
[1:53:50] the message a deceived church by the
[1:53:52] world
[1:53:53] he said remember
[1:53:55] we're not on a picnic
[1:53:58] i think the church has this idea that
[1:54:00] we're we're having a big celebration
[1:54:02] here well i want you to know while
[1:54:04] people are going to hell in a hand
[1:54:05] basket
[1:54:06] is not exactly the time to have a big
[1:54:08] celebration the world's dying and going
[1:54:10] to hell around us and we don't have time
[1:54:12] to be borderline believers
[1:54:14] we got to go all the way because the one
[1:54:16] thing the world don't want none of is
[1:54:18] your religion
[1:54:20] they only want some of your reality
[1:54:23] they don't want to hear you that can
[1:54:24] talk the talk but can't walk the walk i
[1:54:27] hope you're listening to me
[1:54:30] your your life your decisions the way
[1:54:33] you behave can undo your testimony
[1:54:37] at the speed of light
[1:54:39] you've got to be able to walk the walk
[1:54:41] if you're going to talk the talk because
[1:54:43] people are looking for something that
[1:54:46] brings reality that brings fulfillment
[1:54:48] they're not looking for religion they're
[1:54:50] not looking for a bunch of hypocrites
[1:54:53] however let me tell you this your
[1:54:55] pitiful excuse if you're listening to
[1:54:57] this service and you've got that pitiful
[1:54:59] excuse i would go to church but there
[1:55:01] are so many hypocrites
[1:55:04] well may i tell you that if you're
[1:55:05] letting a hypocrite keep you from church
[1:55:08] that hypocrite is standing closer to god
[1:55:10] than you are
[1:55:12] they're standing between you and god
[1:55:15] so you better get your eyes off of
[1:55:17] hypocrites and determine not to be one
[1:55:20] to make up your mind i'm going to serve
[1:55:22] god all the way
[1:55:24] i'm going to give my children an example
[1:55:26] to be proud of
[1:55:28] i'm going to show my children that it's
[1:55:30] a it's possible to overcome anger it's
[1:55:32] possible to overcome violence it's
[1:55:35] possible to overcome addiction i'm going
[1:55:37] to show my children that jesus listen
[1:55:39] they better hear it you better show them
[1:55:42] because the world is going to make the
[1:55:44] same pull for them that it made for you
[1:55:46] and if we love our children we want to
[1:55:48] spare them from walking down the same
[1:55:50] road i don't understand groups of people
[1:55:53] who believe that young people have to go
[1:55:55] out and sin to understand and appreciate
[1:55:58] salvation i don't believe that for one
[1:56:00] moment
[1:56:01] i won't let that be preached around here
[1:56:06] that's not the grace of god
[1:56:08] the same grace of god as i said a moment
[1:56:10] ago that can save you it's the grace of
[1:56:12] god that can keep some of you from ever
[1:56:14] have i don't i don't want my children to
[1:56:16] have to know what it's like to be out of
[1:56:18] their minds
[1:56:19] with alcohol
[1:56:23] i don't want them to ever have to
[1:56:24] understand what some of these things are
[1:56:26] and it will only be the grace of god
[1:56:28] it's nothing it's not some trophy to
[1:56:31] brag about
[1:56:32] it's the grace of god that we celebrate
[1:56:35] he said remember we're not on a picnic
[1:56:37] we're in a battlefield
[1:56:39] he said many people just think when they
[1:56:41] become christian
[1:56:43] that's all they need to do
[1:56:45] that that settles it forever as they're
[1:56:47] a christian and everything's going to
[1:56:49] come easy
[1:56:52] if i am selling that
[1:56:54] forgive me
[1:56:57] because i believe what david said
[1:56:59] your battle begins once you cross over
[1:57:04] if some of you think you've fought to be
[1:57:06] where you are
[1:57:07] you've been fighting that hard on the
[1:57:09] other side of jordan
[1:57:12] what are you going to do when you make
[1:57:13] the crossing
[1:57:15] you're going to have a lot more to
[1:57:16] defeat on this side of the river than
[1:57:17] you had on that side of the river
[1:57:19] because if you think satan is going to
[1:57:21] lay down and play dead while the bride
[1:57:23] of jesus christ takes her position and
[1:57:25] authority in the earth as adopted
[1:57:26] manifested sons of god speaking forth
[1:57:29] the creative word of god
[1:57:31] then you'd be a little crazy in the head
[1:57:34] because satan is not going to lay down
[1:57:36] and play dead he's going to fight you
[1:57:38] every step of the way tooth and toenail
[1:57:41] to discourage you he's going to try to
[1:57:44] pull you out of church he's going to try
[1:57:46] to spoil your faith
[1:57:48] he's going to inspire you to be a thief
[1:57:50] and a robber instead of giving god what
[1:57:53] belongs to him
[1:57:55] he's going to tell you the word of god
[1:57:57] is archaic and has no relevance today
[1:58:01] he's going to tell you the church is
[1:58:03] dead and there's no hope
[1:58:05] he'll tell you all kinds of tales
[1:58:07] but you've got to make up your mind to
[1:58:09] listen to something a little bit higher
[1:58:10] than the enemy
[1:58:11] he said okay it goes on he said don't
[1:58:13] never get that in your head
[1:58:16] it's not a party
[1:58:18] it's not a bed of ease
[1:58:21] he said for i become a christian to do
[1:58:23] what
[1:58:24] to fight
[1:58:26] if you're becoming a christian because
[1:58:28] you want to coast
[1:58:33] you just want to soar through life
[1:58:36] with no battles
[1:58:41] you know jesus was a lot of things
[1:58:44] and one thing he was that he was
[1:58:46] reasonable and fair
[1:58:48] he said i would that thou art either hot
[1:58:50] or cold
[1:58:53] jesus said i'd rather you be off or own
[1:58:56] own or off
[1:58:58] i'd rather you serve me or not serve me
[1:59:02] but the most dangerous place i'm
[1:59:03] paraphrasing the most dangerous place to
[1:59:06] live your life is the in between
[1:59:08] we call that the borderland
[1:59:11] anybody with me are you listening
[1:59:13] i'm just starting so don't don't rush me
[1:59:16] if you need to slip out no one is going
[1:59:18] to be offended at you for doing so but
[1:59:20] neither are we going to rush through a
[1:59:22] service because you had something else
[1:59:23] to do
[1:59:25] anybody with me
[1:59:26] we're not a seeker sensitive uh
[1:59:29] friendly people when it comes to those
[1:59:30] kinds of things we you are welcome to
[1:59:32] come in and out as you need to leave
[1:59:34] when you need to leave but don't come
[1:59:36] thinking you're going to rush us through
[1:59:37] a service
[1:59:38] because this is life to us
[1:59:41] the strength that i get today is not
[1:59:43] just going to carry me till this
[1:59:44] afternoon
[1:59:45] the strength i get today is going to
[1:59:47] bring me
[1:59:48] through to the next week
[1:59:50] and to the next week that don't mean
[1:59:52] that i'm not going to have to you know
[1:59:54] engage him and fellowship him and
[1:59:56] worship him and read the bible
[1:59:59] but many times the anointing that falls
[2:00:02] on us corporately on a sunday carries us
[2:00:05] all week
[2:00:06] we just keep going back and chewing
[2:00:09] did you know there's people here that'll
[2:00:10] watch a service on sunday that they sat
[2:00:12] in they'll watch it at least three times
[2:00:14] before they come back next sunday
[2:00:17] you can hardly get through it once
[2:00:20] come on i know you love me
[2:00:23] you can hardly get through one and yet
[2:00:25] there's people that'll go back and watch
[2:00:27] it three times
[2:00:29] you know why because they realize you
[2:00:31] can't catch it all right
[2:00:33] you're still reeling from one statement
[2:00:35] that's made and god slips something else
[2:00:37] over here for us and we have to feed we
[2:00:39] are literally feeding on god's living
[2:00:41] word
[2:00:42] and that's what's sustaining us and
[2:00:44] keeping us in this battle
[2:00:46] he said now listen he said i'll become a
[2:00:48] christian to fight fight the good fight
[2:00:50] of faith i become a christian to get in
[2:00:52] the battle in the battle lines
[2:00:55] he said we're christian soldiers and
[2:00:58] we've got to be trained
[2:01:01] that's why we're here today
[2:01:03] that's why we're here this morning
[2:01:06] we're being trained to fight the good
[2:01:08] fight of faith
[2:01:11] trained and brought up and know all the
[2:01:13] techniques of the enemy
[2:01:16] because we need to know how to fortify
[2:01:20] how to prepare our position
[2:01:24] how to entrench ourselves
[2:01:26] so that the enemy is not able to advance
[2:01:29] in our lives
[2:01:30] we cannot be ignorant in this hour
[2:01:32] just because you refuse to pay attention
[2:01:34] to what the enemy is doing does not mean
[2:01:36] that he's not actively involved in
[2:01:38] trying to take your mind
[2:01:41] the enemy doesn't just want to cause you
[2:01:43] to stub your toe
[2:01:46] he wants to destroy your life
[2:01:49] he's out for blood somebody said you're
[2:01:50] making it sound pretty serious it is
[2:01:52] serious
[2:01:54] it's a life-or-death event
[2:01:56] that's why some people satisfy they
[2:01:58] settle for religion because they don't
[2:02:00] want to get in the fight
[2:02:02] amen if you're here this morning and you
[2:02:04] don't want to get in the fight you're
[2:02:05] going to be miserable around us
[2:02:08] because we don't believe in passive
[2:02:10] christianity
[2:02:11] we believe the only way to take the
[2:02:13] kingdom the only way to advance the work
[2:02:15] of the lord jesus is to stand against
[2:02:18] the wiles of the enemy to expose him to
[2:02:22] call him out
[2:02:24] put the word on him
[2:02:26] to rebuke him to resist him
[2:02:28] the bible excuse me the quote goes on to
[2:02:30] say we got to be trained and brought up
[2:02:32] and know all the techniques of the enemy
[2:02:34] to know how to fortify and to know how
[2:02:36] to fight the fight
[2:02:38] god help us we want to know how to fight
[2:02:40] the fight and we can only do that
[2:02:44] look at what it says you can only do
[2:02:47] that as the holy spirit will what
[2:02:52] reveal it to us
[2:02:53] we're here to learn something
[2:02:56] we're here to have something revealed to
[2:02:58] us
[2:03:01] you do not have to be a a slave to a
[2:03:03] controlling spirit
[2:03:07] you don't have to control everything
[2:03:08] around you
[2:03:10] god's a big god
[2:03:13] he wants you
[2:03:14] but he doesn't have to have you
[2:03:17] to keep things going
[2:03:19] he's got somebody
[2:03:21] come on
[2:03:22] some people just need to understand what
[2:03:24] their place is in the kingdom of god
[2:03:27] get their hands off of other people's
[2:03:28] lives
[2:03:30] if you want to help somebody go to your
[2:03:31] knees
[2:03:32] pray like a wild man be so full of the
[2:03:35] holy ghost that everybody's attracted to
[2:03:37] what you've got to offer
[2:03:40] but don't find yourself stepping into a
[2:03:41] metron that's not yours
[2:03:44] and a metron is a greek word used in the
[2:03:46] new testament for spiritual jurisdiction
[2:03:48] and it is not everybody's place to
[2:03:50] pastor a church it's not everybody's
[2:03:53] place to deal with some of the problems
[2:03:55] and to train the people for war but
[2:03:57] god's got somebody
[2:04:00] he always has somebody to do the job
[2:04:05] you've just got to recognize that
[2:04:06] somebody he said we can only do that as
[2:04:08] the holy spirit will reveal it to us we
[2:04:11] cannot take what some other nation tells
[2:04:13] us when we go to war some of their ideas
[2:04:15] so to speak all right
[2:04:17] we've got to know what the holy spirit
[2:04:19] is saying
[2:04:20] we've got to know what god would have us
[2:04:22] do he said but we've got to take our own
[2:04:24] ideas the way the holy spirit
[2:04:27] would direct us
[2:04:29] and what ideas he would give us
[2:04:32] because he is the what
[2:04:35] the commander-in-chief
[2:04:37] of the army of the christians
[2:04:40] let me tell you something your
[2:04:42] commanding officer will give you the
[2:04:44] orders
[2:04:46] if you've got a humble spirit
[2:04:48] and you can say yes sir
[2:04:50] lord i'm ready to do whatever it is that
[2:04:52] you've called me to do let me tell you
[2:04:54] something what god's looking for out of
[2:04:56] us stay with me
[2:04:57] do you know what god's looking for out
[2:04:59] of us
[2:05:00] obedience
[2:05:03] he wants a people that will obey him he
[2:05:06] wants a people that will choose to walk
[2:05:08] in freedom
[2:05:09] in a message called the pool of bethesda
[2:05:11] you still here
[2:05:12] a whole lot of moving around going on i
[2:05:14] hope you'll be mindful that we're having
[2:05:16] service
[2:05:18] but the battle is on
[2:05:21] right against wrong
[2:05:24] skepticism against the word of god faith
[2:05:28] against unbelief
[2:05:29] oh father may the angels i love this one
[2:05:33] may the angels of god wave their white
[2:05:36] flag the banners of the cross
[2:05:39] and may the holy spirit rise tonight may
[2:05:43] signs and wonders be done
[2:05:46] we give you all things
[2:05:49] believing them
[2:05:52] this is where we are lord
[2:05:54] we believe that you can help us to
[2:05:57] overcome
[2:05:58] whatever it is that the enemy throws
[2:06:00] against us let me give you the verse i
[2:06:02] quoted earlier ii corinthians 2 11.
[2:06:05] this is what we have to keep in mind
[2:06:08] second corinthians chapter 2 verse 11
[2:06:11] last
[2:06:13] satan
[2:06:15] lest
[2:06:16] satan
[2:06:18] should get an advantage
[2:06:20] of us
[2:06:23] for we do have it
[2:06:25] for we are not ignorant
[2:06:31] of
[2:06:32] his
[2:06:33] devices
[2:06:35] listen we're not naive people
[2:06:38] we've been through the fire
[2:06:40] hawk how long have you served the lord
[2:06:41] now
[2:06:43] 20 years
[2:06:49] we didn't just get in this thing
[2:06:55] ben ellsworth how long have you served
[2:06:58] the lord i know everybody's counting in
[2:06:59] their head
[2:07:00] anticipating that i may ask them
[2:07:05] 14 years
[2:07:06] brother greeley how long have you really
[2:07:08] served the lord
[2:07:10] 35 years are you 35 years old
[2:07:15] 35
[2:07:16] years
[2:07:18] brother reid how many years have you
[2:07:20] served the lord
[2:07:23] 45
[2:07:24] years well we may not have trophies
[2:07:29] we may not have accolades to hand out
[2:07:32] but i just wanted you all to know we are
[2:07:34] not ignorant
[2:07:36] that the devil will use anybody
[2:07:41] and anything
[2:07:43] it's not by coincidence that that david
[2:07:46] sung the song he sung and the lord gave
[2:07:48] me reminding me of the scripture because
[2:07:50] that leviathan that twisting serpent
[2:07:54] that the psalmist talks about that is a
[2:07:56] spirit that desires to cut you off from
[2:07:59] your life source
[2:08:02] he doesn't want you to believe the whole
[2:08:03] truth and nothing but the truth
[2:08:06] he wants to pollute and contaminate and
[2:08:08] pervert truth
[2:08:10] he wants to twist the way things are
[2:08:12] spoken in your ear so that you will take
[2:08:15] it in an entirely different way than
[2:08:17] what it was intended
[2:08:19] do you know most disagreements that
[2:08:21] happen among families and friends is
[2:08:23] because of a spirit
[2:08:26] that desires to twist things
[2:08:30] it's nobody to blame it's the enemy to
[2:08:33] blame but it's all of us to blame if we
[2:08:36] don't recognize that it's him
[2:08:40] we're not ignorant of his devices
[2:08:43] there have been times even in my family
[2:08:45] it's been some time ago
[2:08:47] but there have been times in our family
[2:08:49] when we would be having a real knockdown
[2:08:52] drag out
[2:08:57] kids up in the air
[2:09:00] dad up in the air mom up in the air just
[2:09:04] bickering with one another i don't think
[2:09:06] we were physically throwing down or
[2:09:08] anything like that
[2:09:10] because we all know i would have
[2:09:12] sat on them in one
[2:09:16] but we were yelling
[2:09:18] i remember time sitting in the kitchen
[2:09:20] table around the kitchen table and we
[2:09:23] were just bitterly disagreeing about
[2:09:26] something and but you said but you did
[2:09:29] i know i'm just blowing your image
[2:09:34] of our family life
[2:09:37] totally forgetting
[2:09:39] who we are
[2:09:41] totally forgetting what was going on
[2:09:44] and one of my kids
[2:09:46] usually joshua
[2:09:48] one of my kids
[2:09:50] would stand up and say wait a minute
[2:09:56] we need to recognize
[2:09:59] that this is the devil
[2:10:03] this is not god
[2:10:06] he is not pleased with the way we're
[2:10:08] carrying on
[2:10:10] we need to turn our attention on the
[2:10:13] enemy instead of blaming one another
[2:10:16] now how do you keep fighting in an
[2:10:18] atmosphere like that where one of your
[2:10:19] kids is raised up to rebuke you
[2:10:25] i didn't exercise my authority as a dad
[2:10:27] and say sit down and shut up you don't
[2:10:29] know what you're talking about
[2:10:31] because i knew he didn't know what he
[2:10:33] was talking about and was just happened
[2:10:35] to happen to be the most sensitive in
[2:10:37] that moment to catch that this is the
[2:10:39] enemy and we can stop this thing right
[2:10:41] here we don't have to argue another five
[2:10:44] minutes we can get the victory over this
[2:10:46] we can turn our prayers to god we can
[2:10:49] turn our anger toward the enemy and we
[2:10:51] can love one another out of this mess
[2:10:54] how many of you understand what i'm
[2:10:55] trying to tell you
[2:10:58] we have to be able to recognize this
[2:11:00] isn't us
[2:11:02] this is the enemy trying to destroy
[2:11:05] us
[2:11:06] and he will unless we raise up and turn
[2:11:08] our attention against him
[2:11:10] that spirit that once tried to destroy
[2:11:13] the saints of god twisting truth and
[2:11:15] trying to take them under the water and
[2:11:18] drown them in the depths of the sea
[2:11:20] can become bread
[2:11:23] it can become strength
[2:11:25] it can become sustenance to us in the
[2:11:28] battle that rages
[2:11:30] we have to make up our mind let me tell
[2:11:32] you something your pastor can't cut that
[2:11:35] thing off in your life without your
[2:11:37] cooperation
[2:11:39] your god won't even do it
[2:11:42] you've got to come to a place where you
[2:11:44] realize this is the enemy trying to
[2:11:46] twist my emotions anybody with me
[2:11:49] he's trying to destroy my family
[2:11:52] he's trying to destroy my relationships
[2:11:55] and instead of putting a name on it like
[2:11:57] my friend my brother my sister
[2:12:00] i need to turn my attention on the one
[2:12:02] that's out to kill me
[2:12:04] and say no more enemy
[2:12:08] are you with me good i just need a
[2:12:10] little more of your time not much
[2:12:12] in a message called christianity versus
[2:12:14] idolatry you still here
[2:12:16] good that's right
[2:12:18] he said you've got to know the word
[2:12:21] this is the only way to walk in the
[2:12:23] victory this is the only way for freedom
[2:12:25] to become a choice this is the only way
[2:12:27] for freedom to become a mindset
[2:12:30] is we have to choose freedom
[2:12:32] and we choose it by staying on the word
[2:12:36] he said see the great battle is at hand
[2:12:38] now we've played church for years and
[2:12:40] years
[2:12:41] but the hour has come now
[2:12:44] that when jamborus and janice will
[2:12:46] withstand moses as the bible said they
[2:12:48] would and it's going to be spiritual
[2:12:51] battle
[2:12:55] imitator against genuin
[2:13:00] that's what he wants to do
[2:13:02] it's going to be spiritual battle
[2:13:05] conflict
[2:13:06] there will be some just continue on
[2:13:09] the denominational church will just move
[2:13:12] right on into domination and go on the
[2:13:14] way it goes
[2:13:16] but i mean listen close
[2:13:19] the real true believer is coming to that
[2:13:22] battlefield and you had better be versed
[2:13:25] and know what you're doing
[2:13:27] listen listen listen
[2:13:30] i know there are visitors here but i'm
[2:13:32] talking to this church
[2:13:34] he said or you could take an evil spirit
[2:13:37] so easy
[2:13:42] and not know you've got to be versed in
[2:13:45] the battle
[2:13:46] you've got to understand what the enemy
[2:13:48] is out to do
[2:13:49] and you've got to realize that even as a
[2:13:51] child of god you can come under a wrong
[2:13:53] spirit this is not demon possession this
[2:13:56] is just taking on a wrong spirit this is
[2:13:58] taking on a wrong attitude some people
[2:14:00] pout all the time
[2:14:02] that's a wrong spirit
[2:14:05] i'll just be honest with you that's a
[2:14:06] wrong spirit
[2:14:07] i don't have time for that i'm going to
[2:14:09] sound a little ugly here don't have time
[2:14:10] for that i don't have time for powders
[2:14:14] powders or doubters and going to be do
[2:14:15] withouters
[2:14:19] we didn't put up with our children
[2:14:20] patent and we're not going to put up
[2:14:22] with adults pounding
[2:14:23] you get under that poutine spirit and
[2:14:26] everything and everybody will make you
[2:14:28] pooch out your lips
[2:14:30] you'll be 45 years old 40 55 65 years
[2:14:34] old acting like a little three-year-old
[2:14:36] in a corner
[2:14:39] well your nose stuck in the corner like
[2:14:41] some little child being disciplined just
[2:14:42] pouting and pouting and pouting always
[2:14:45] got your feelings on your sleeves and
[2:14:46] always hurt with somebody about
[2:14:48] something
[2:14:49] there comes a time folks that we grow up
[2:14:52] a little bit in the faith
[2:14:56] and we recognize that spirits want to
[2:14:58] use us
[2:15:00] they want to ride in on us
[2:15:03] they want to utilize us
[2:15:08] he said you can if you're not versed in
[2:15:10] these things and know what you're doing
[2:15:11] you could take an evil spirit so easy
[2:15:13] and not know if it's contrary to this
[2:15:16] word
[2:15:17] don't
[2:15:18] believe it
[2:15:22] if it's always condemning someone it's
[2:15:24] contrary to the word
[2:15:26] if it's always trying to control someone
[2:15:28] it's it's contrary to the word if it's
[2:15:31] always trying to manipulate a situation
[2:15:33] selfishly it's contrary to the word
[2:15:36] anybody with me and if it's contrary to
[2:15:38] the word don't believe it
[2:15:43] you stay with that word
[2:15:46] because freedom is a choice
[2:15:48] let me tell you what god did up here for
[2:15:50] brother joshua llano is real
[2:15:53] and it is genuine
[2:15:55] and it is powerful and it is potent
[2:15:58] and god wants to do that for every one
[2:16:01] of us who need to be free he has met
[2:16:03] many of us
[2:16:05] but it's going to be up to him and it's
[2:16:07] going to be up to us
[2:16:09] to continue in every situation at all
[2:16:11] times in the heat of the battle when all
[2:16:14] guns are turned on him
[2:16:16] and they will it's going to be up to him
[2:16:18] to choose free freedom is i am freedom
[2:16:24] i am freedom i'm not coming under
[2:16:26] bondage
[2:16:27] to what you think about me
[2:16:30] or what you say about me
[2:16:32] or how you perceive me
[2:16:34] i'm not coming into bondage by what the
[2:16:36] enemy says about me
[2:16:40] i choose to be free
[2:16:42] i didn't come to this thing totally
[2:16:44] ignorant
[2:16:46] i know you you're you're recognizing
[2:16:48] what the enemy tries to do
[2:16:50] and you begin to take authority over him
[2:16:53] he said the real true believer coming to
[2:16:55] the battlefield you better be versed and
[2:16:56] know what you're doing
[2:16:58] or you could take an evil spirit so easy
[2:17:00] or not no
[2:17:02] if it's contrary to this word don't
[2:17:05] believe it
[2:17:06] stay with the word
[2:17:10] second corinthians 3 17 i need about 15
[2:17:13] more minutes
[2:17:16] second corinthians chapter 3 verse 17
[2:17:18] now the lord is that spirit
[2:17:22] we're not talking about some strange
[2:17:23] spirit we're talking about adonai we're
[2:17:26] talking about the spirit of the lord
[2:17:28] now the lord is that spirit and where
[2:17:30] the spirit of the lord is
[2:17:36] i don't like going to churches where
[2:17:37] they get loud
[2:17:39] you know you're gonna have a problem
[2:17:44] my old granny used to say this is the
[2:17:45] quietest world you're ever going to live
[2:17:47] in
[2:17:48] it's going to get louder from here on
[2:17:50] out
[2:17:52] because if you go to heaven
[2:17:55] if you think i'm going to go to heaven
[2:17:57] and act like some presbyterian

[2:18:04] if you don't like shout and stay off of
[2:18:06] my cloud
[2:18:07] my cloud's going to be the loud crowd
[2:18:10] i've got something to praise the lord
[2:18:12] for
[2:18:14] i'm not no hypocrite i'm not going down
[2:18:16] to the ball game and get excited if i
[2:18:18] can't come to church and get excited
[2:18:24] and on occasion i'm not a big sports fan
[2:18:26] but i have when my boys were batting
[2:18:29] i've been known to be a little loud
[2:18:35] just
[2:18:36] a few people here could verify that
[2:18:41] boy i've had some i had kind of stay
[2:18:43] away from it

[2:19:12] hands

[2:19:24] raise my hands to praise the lord
[2:19:26] anybody with me
[2:19:27] let me tell you something serving god is
[2:19:30] the best decision that i've ever made in
[2:19:32] my life loving jesus i've never
[2:19:36] regretted it
[2:19:38] and i don't believe there's anything
[2:19:39] wrong with doing it with all your heart
[2:19:42] with all your might
[2:19:44] i don't believe the days of miracles are
[2:19:46] over i believe everywhere jesus went
[2:19:49] noyes went to
[2:19:52] bartimaeus they had to tell him hold
[2:19:54] your peace hold your peace you're going
[2:19:57] to have to hush now you're getting out
[2:19:59] of hand he couldn't help himself at
[2:20:00] times his the joy of the lord
[2:20:04] here they come out of the temple and
[2:20:05] here's such a crippled man and and
[2:20:08] they're they're asking oh he's asking
[2:20:10] alms
[2:20:11] and he's reaching out they looked at him
[2:20:13] and said silver and gold have i none but
[2:20:16] such as i have give i thee in the name
[2:20:19] of jesus christ of nazareth get up and
[2:20:21] walk
[2:20:22] [Music]
[2:20:25] and the bible said he quietly
[2:20:27] reverently
[2:20:29] dignified
[2:20:32] gradually rose from his place of
[2:20:34] prostration
[2:20:39] and wiggled his big toe in his sandal
[2:20:42] no no no no no that's not what the bible
[2:20:45] said it all it said he went leaping
[2:20:50] leaping jumping leaping hallelujah i was
[2:20:54] a but i'm not a anymore
[2:20:58] he went walking and leaping and praising
[2:21:02] god
[2:21:02] [Applause]
[2:21:04] why because he had nothing to be ashamed
[2:21:06] of
[2:21:08] let me tell you something his noise his
[2:21:10] noise was greater than the preacher's
[2:21:13] sermon
[2:21:17] because everybody had passed by
[2:21:20] and seen his broken condition
[2:21:23] he was well known in the community he
[2:21:26] had been sitting there begging for money
[2:21:27] for years
[2:21:29] they saw his withered feet
[2:21:32] they saw how he had to be drug into
[2:21:34] position
[2:21:35] and drug out a position
[2:21:37] but not this day
[2:21:39] oh he was walking and leaping and giving
[2:21:42] praise to god let me tell you something
[2:21:45] there are people that would tell you
[2:21:46] that miracles ended with the apostles
[2:21:48] they're lying to you
[2:21:50] you hear your preacher they're lying to
[2:21:52] you
[2:21:52] they're not good men telling you those
[2:21:54] lies
[2:21:55] the bible said he is the same
[2:22:00] will you give the lord a shout
[2:22:02] will you give him a praise right now
[2:22:05] well you lift up a shout do you believe
[2:22:07] he's the same
[2:22:09] [Applause]
[2:22:10] [Music]
[2:22:13] do you believe he's the same
[2:22:18] i'm closing the message go tell
[2:22:20] broke every slave belt
[2:22:22] listen to this
[2:22:24] paragraph 80 and we continue a moment
[2:22:27] with the slaves in our thought
[2:22:29] there was a proclamation emancipation of
[2:22:31] the proclamation that was signed
[2:22:36] you remember the story
[2:22:38] brother brown tells about the blind man
[2:22:40] weeping
[2:22:41] because he saw a drop of abraham
[2:22:43] lincoln's blood
[2:22:51] abraham lincoln wasn't
[2:22:54] a slave a slave man
[2:22:58] abraham lincoln wasn't his savior
[2:23:00] but he's the one that gave him his
[2:23:01] freedom
[2:23:03] and he was so moved by seeing a stain of
[2:23:05] abraham lincoln's blood
[2:23:07] that it moved him to tears
[2:23:11] that man got more excited over the blood
[2:23:13] of abraham lincoln
[2:23:15] than christians get
[2:23:17] about the blood of jesus christ
[2:23:20] are you listening to what i'm saying
[2:23:23] don't you be guilty
[2:23:26] he said
[2:23:28] and the slaves was going to be free upon
[2:23:30] a certain day you you don't know how if
[2:23:33] you've never met christ you never know
[2:23:34] what it means
[2:23:36] meant to be to them slaves
[2:23:39] you may have never been a slave in the
[2:23:40] natural you may have never been under
[2:23:42] that kind of oppression like many people
[2:23:44] have been but many of us experienced
[2:23:46] slavery
[2:23:48] in another realm
[2:23:50] of spiritual slavery
[2:23:52] he said when it went the message
[2:23:54] throughout the land you're going to be
[2:23:55] free on such a such a day at daylight
[2:23:58] you're going to be free you'll not have
[2:24:00] to wear slave belts anymore neither will
[2:24:02] you get any more weapons
[2:24:05] but you're free and you're a citizen of
[2:24:07] this great united states you are no more
[2:24:10] a slave after daylight on a certain
[2:24:13] morning oh with great anticipations they
[2:24:16] waited
[2:24:18] if the sinner could only see that if the
[2:24:21] sinner would only hear the true gospel
[2:24:25] not the joining of a church
[2:24:30] but the preaching of the gospel that you
[2:24:32] can be free from sin and that you can be
[2:24:35] free from your sickness at a certain
[2:24:37] certain time that's the time you believe
[2:24:40] you know those slaves were so excited
[2:24:42] and under such anticipation waiting for
[2:24:45] the hour that they would be free until
[2:24:47] they tell me they gathered at the bottom
[2:24:49] of the hill mothers and little children
[2:24:51] all gathered and some of the old and
[2:24:53] they climbed up to the top of the
[2:24:55] mountain around midnight
[2:24:59] they knowed when that day broke
[2:25:02] and the sun come up
[2:25:04] that they would be free
[2:25:05] [Music]
[2:25:07] it couldn't take over one half a minute
[2:25:08] to shine the sun from the top of the
[2:25:10] hill but some of them was up on the top
[2:25:12] of the hill watching
[2:25:14] they didn't dare stay at the bottom and
[2:25:16] wait for the sun to top the mountain
[2:25:17] some of them wanted to be the first to
[2:25:19] see it
[2:25:20] i don't know how i'd have made it up
[2:25:22] there but i believe i'd have been one of
[2:25:23] them
[2:25:25] not one half a second more in slavery
[2:25:27] than i have to have
[2:25:29] not one extra minute as a slave to the
[2:25:32] enemy when jesus comes to liberate us
[2:25:35] and set us free why would you want to
[2:25:37] live another day choosing
[2:25:41] bitterness or anger or jealousy or
[2:25:44] resentment when every bit of that can be
[2:25:46] taken
[2:25:48] oh he said some of them was up on the
[2:25:50] hill watching watching oh when the sun
[2:25:52] rises we're free he said that was the
[2:25:54] s-u-n
[2:25:56] let's go on but when the s-o-n rises one
[2:26:00] of these days
[2:26:01] and when the s-o-n rose some 1900 years
[2:26:04] ago he broke every slave belt
[2:26:09] i want to ask you how many of you have
[2:26:10] ever been a slave to sin
[2:26:13] come on hold up your hand
[2:26:16] did you know jesus christ has broke
[2:26:18] every slave belt if you've accepted him
[2:26:21] as your lord and savior
[2:26:23] he set every captive free he healed
[2:26:25] every sickness he gave freedom to those
[2:26:27] who are in bondage how we ought to climb
[2:26:29] and watch
[2:26:31] and when the sun peeped
[2:26:33] up first the man was at the highest saw
[2:26:36] it and be shouted he shouted down to the
[2:26:38] next man we are free
[2:26:41] and the next man shouted to the man
[2:26:43] further down the hill we are free
[2:26:46] until it come to the camp we are free
[2:26:48] for the sun was arising they were
[2:26:50] waiting waiting waiting for that hour
[2:26:53] musicians are coming
[2:26:56] how much more
[2:26:59] ought we to be waiting today
[2:27:02] for the son of god
[2:27:05] we are free from sin
[2:27:09] help me now
[2:27:10] we are free from the shackles
[2:27:14] we are free from habits
[2:27:17] we are free from smoking and drinking
[2:27:19] and carousing
[2:27:21] because the essential of god hallelujah
[2:27:25] has raised from the grave
[2:27:28] and has broke
[2:27:31] every fetter while they're getting ready
[2:27:35] let me finish this one all condemnation
[2:27:37] is gone

[2:27:40] paid the sins are washed away and we're
[2:27:43] free oh we're free people
[2:27:45] slavery
[2:27:46] freedom when the son of god rises
[2:27:50] with healing in his wings
[2:27:53] the last quotation i want to share with
[2:27:55] you is from god doesn't call man to
[2:27:56] judgment without first warning in
[2:27:58] paragraph 40. he said now because we
[2:28:01] have a responsibility
[2:28:03] that we've got to answer to god someday
[2:28:05] for
[2:28:06] every man that come on the face of the
[2:28:08] earth has to answer to god for a
[2:28:10] responsibility
[2:28:13] we are responsible to maintain the
[2:28:17] freedom
[2:28:18] that has become ours
[2:28:20] through the free gift of deliverance and
[2:28:21] salvation
[2:28:23] and how do we do that one decision at a
[2:28:24] time one choice at a time

[2:45:43] [Music]
[2:45:50] oh
[2:45:52] [Music]
[2:45:56] of god
[2:45:58] [Music]
[2:46:20] oh
[2:46:25] [Music]
[2:46:34] oh
[2:46:38] [Music]
[2:46:51] the lord brought them here
[2:46:53] they came here for deliverance
[2:46:56] god's already used them
[2:46:58] they came here to get help
[2:47:01] and god's already used them to help us
[2:47:04] so we've got so much to be thankful for
[2:47:07] but it seemed like every uh uh attack
[2:47:10] seemed like every tart they become a
[2:47:12] real target and every weapon of the
[2:47:14] enemy
[2:47:16] is formed against them in one way or
[2:47:17] another
[2:47:19] there's healing taking place in their
[2:47:21] marriage
[2:47:22] and in their relationship
[2:47:24] and they're they're coming together
[2:47:27] in a way that's gonna i tell you it's
[2:47:29] gonna defeat a lot of devils
[2:47:31] and it's gonna help a lot of marriages
[2:47:34] it's going to help a lot of people one
[2:47:35] of these days i'm sure that but i want
[2:47:37] you to stretch your hand toward them
[2:47:39] right now
[2:47:41] i want everybody in this room to take
[2:47:43] just a moment and ask the lord they need
[2:47:45] favor they need grace they need
[2:47:48] provision and they need to be surrounded
[2:47:52] they need to be surrounded
[2:47:55] and we can do that in our prayer
[2:47:57] we can do that in our prayers we can
[2:48:00] surround them right now
[2:48:02] and help shield them
[2:48:05] from the target that's painted on their
[2:48:07] back
[2:48:09] it's because of the depth of the
[2:48:11] testimony it's because of the depth of
[2:48:13] the deliverance
[2:48:15] that the enemy would like
[2:48:18] to continue to harass
[2:48:20] and target them
[2:48:22] but we are believing god today
[2:48:33] i want to obey the lord
[2:48:36] i don't want to make anybody
[2:48:38] uncomfortable but i want to obey the
[2:48:39] lord i want brother
[2:48:41] austin where is austin hodges and anna i
[2:48:43] want them to come i want you all to come
[2:48:45] stand behind them would you
[2:48:47] would you
[2:48:49] i don't want to make this awkward at all
[2:48:55] they have a friendship
[2:48:58] that the enemy likes to attack
[2:49:03] i tell you when god gets through he's
[2:49:05] laid a call on austin's life
[2:49:10] god's healing him
[2:49:15] they're a kingdom couple
[2:49:18] you're looking at two
[2:49:19] kingdom couples
[2:49:24] i i don't think you ought to judge
[2:49:25] people based on how smart they are
[2:49:29] but i got to tell you
[2:49:31] these are some of the smartest people i
[2:49:33] know
[2:49:34] they are there there's a level of
[2:49:37] intelligence that they
[2:49:38] carry but i marvel at
[2:49:42] i mean all four of them
[2:49:45] and i want us to cover them right now
[2:49:47] i've just prayed over sister rebecca
[2:49:48] there but but i want us to cover them
[2:49:50] right now
[2:49:53] i i called austin and anna to stand
[2:49:55] there as support
[2:49:57] but as soon as i did i realized
[2:50:00] that it's the will of god that we just
[2:50:02] surround all four of them right now
[2:50:08] iron sharpeneth iron
[2:50:11] they are not in a pleasant uh
[2:50:13] situation
[2:50:16] having to learn to live in community
[2:50:19] [Music]
[2:50:20] but it's because of the greater purposes
[2:50:22] of god
[2:50:24] it's because of the great deliverances
[2:50:28] that are represented in that four right
[2:50:30] there
[2:50:31] i'm telling you i feel something rising
[2:50:33] up in me right now i might lift off the
[2:50:36] ground
[2:50:37] i feel something rising up through my
[2:50:39] legs to strengthen me right now and i
[2:50:42] know that it's just the power
[2:50:44] of the and the anointing of the holy
[2:50:46] ghost i want this church to cry out
[2:50:49] for for uh for a real hedge
[2:50:52] to be built around them right now to

[2:55:08] spirit that is not of me saith the lord
[2:55:12] all that you have carried in life and
[2:55:15] and the hurt
[2:55:17] and the misunderstandings
[2:55:19] that go all the way back to the time
[2:55:21] that you were just a little girl
[2:55:23] and you seem to be passed over so many
[2:55:25] times
[2:55:27] and be lost in the noise
[2:55:29] the lord said you will not be lost in
[2:55:31] the noise i will not allow you to be
[2:55:34] lost in the noise i will bring forth
[2:55:35] your voice
[2:55:38] and it shall roar

[2:55:42] voice it will be my voice the voice of

[2:55:53] to me in this moment
[2:56:08] because you have consulted my word
[2:56:11] because you have surrendered to my word

[2:57:27] the call of god on your life
[2:57:30] and and i want to tell you that what you
[2:57:31] are today what you stand here before me
[2:57:33] today
[2:57:34] is barely barely a small portion
[2:57:39] of what god desires to make of you
[2:57:44] the healing that you have testified
[2:57:46] about the fullness of that healing is
[2:57:47] coming it's coming
[2:57:49] it's coming
[2:57:50] it's coming you're going to have to be
[2:57:51] patient
[2:57:53] it's coming because there's some roots
[2:57:55] that the holy ghost wants to dig out of
[2:57:57] your life
[2:57:58] to give you the healing that you need
[2:58:01] and god said i'm going to give you the
[2:58:03] marriage
[2:58:05] that you have desired to have
[2:58:07] because i'm going to help make you a new
[2:58:09] creation
[2:58:11] and i believe the lord is going to do
[2:58:13] the same
[2:58:15] for our sister anna

[2:58:30] would desire to run and never stop
[2:58:33] never even turn or look back
[2:58:35] but i am the lord and i have sustained
[2:58:38] you
[2:58:39] and i will bring about the deliverance
[2:58:41] that you desire i will open your
[2:58:42] understanding
[2:58:44] in a way that it has never opened before
[2:58:49] you will not just walk on the knowledge
[2:58:51] and the intelligence that i have given
[2:58:53] you but you will soar on revelation says
[2:58:55] the lord thank you for i will bring you
[2:58:58] to a new level as you surrender it all
[2:59:01] to me give it up
[2:59:03] i hear the lord say give it up

[2:59:14] my love your mind
[2:59:17] you are mine and i made you thus
[2:59:21] i have created you with strength saith
[2:59:23] the lord
[2:59:25] and i will redeem that strength
[2:59:28] and i will redeem who you are in the
[2:59:30] natural
[2:59:32] and i will use that for the building of
[2:59:34] my kingdom saith the lord

[3:08:06] embarrass you but we might as well get
[3:08:08] it all over with you all right get your
[3:08:09] good embarrassment i know what the lord
[3:08:11] did for you
[3:08:12] and i don't want the enemy to try to
[3:08:14] close you down it's too soon
[3:08:16] i don't want you to have to fight
[3:08:18] battles now that should be way off over
[3:08:20] there somewhere
[3:08:21] and so i want the lord to loose a praise
[3:08:23] in you i also feel that you are a called
[3:08:25] praiser
[3:08:26] you're called to worship i know you're
[3:08:28] quiet by nature
[3:08:30] all that can change if god wants it to
[3:08:32] if he don't lord knows there's a man
[3:08:35] somewhere that's going to need a quiet
[3:08:37] wife
[3:08:39] they're very few and far between
[3:08:42] so don't feel like you have to be
[3:08:44] anything but what god created you to be
[3:08:46] but i don't want you to hold back in
[3:08:47] your praise i want you to be absolutely
[3:08:50] free to raise up your hands
[3:08:52] because you are just like god wants you
[3:08:54] to be you're standing right now
[3:08:57] right where god would have you and i
[3:08:59] don't want anything to interview so just
[3:09:01] raise up both hands
[3:09:02] and if i have embarrassed you i just
[3:09:04] trust you'll forgive me i believe you
[3:09:05] will
[3:09:06] father
[3:09:08] in the name of jesus
[3:09:15] oh josiah
[3:09:16] the minute i laid my hands on you i saw
[3:09:18] a sword
[3:09:19] propped on your shoulder
[3:09:22] and i believe the lord wants to give you
[3:09:24] a praise
[3:09:25] that routes the enemy
[3:09:27] i believe god wants to give you a praise
[3:09:29] that pushes back the darkness so i'm
[3:09:31] going to call on that to begin to bubble
[3:09:34] i'm going to call on that to begin to
[3:09:36] bubble up
[3:09:37] on the inside of the inside oh whoa
[3:09:42] lord you see anything
[3:09:44] and everything that the enemy would use
[3:09:47] to hold her
[3:09:48] to hinder her
[3:09:50] to intimidate her to strike fear
[3:10:00] can i just tell you
[3:10:02] that jesus is the best friend
[3:10:05] that you will ever have
[3:10:10] he's the only daddy
[3:10:12] that i've ever known
[3:10:17] i didn't really
[3:10:18] know my daddy
[3:10:21] but he told me
[3:10:23] that he would be my father
[3:10:27] and he has been faithful
[3:10:29] [Music]
[3:10:31] i believe he wanted me to tell you
[3:10:34] that he will be faithful to you
[3:10:37] as your
[3:10:38] papa
[3:10:40] he wants to reveal himself to you
[3:10:44] as your papa
[3:10:47] some people are uncomfortable even using
[3:10:50] that language
[3:10:51] but the psalmist said abba father
[3:10:54] and abba is a word that means papa it
[3:10:57] means daddy
[3:10:59] it's a term of endearment and i know
[3:11:01] christians that have been serving the
[3:11:03] lord for years that wouldn't dare use a
[3:11:05] term like that but he has revealed
[3:11:07] himself to me as a papa
[3:11:09] and he wants to reveal himself to you as
[3:11:11] a papa and we just seal that right now
[3:11:15] and we just say the enemy is defeated
[3:11:17] there's going to be peace reigning in
[3:11:19] her life and she is not going into a
[3:11:21] shell she's coming out of that she's not
[3:11:24] going backwards she's going forward
[3:11:26] in the name of jesus
[3:11:30] god's going to give her a voice to
[3:11:32] praise
[3:11:33] and advice to speak true
[3:11:36] hallie i condya
[3:11:39] we just seal that in right now
[3:11:41] hallelujah
[3:11:44] no fear
[3:11:49] [Music]
[3:11:52] just tell him you love him you can just
[3:11:53] do it inside it doesn't matter to me how
[3:11:55] you do it just let him know you love him
[3:11:58] hallelujah
[3:12:00] i'm no longer

[3:12:12] of god

[3:13:38] of
[3:13:40] god lord we thank you
[3:13:44] that you are god sovereign and supreme
[3:13:47] you have set us free from the yoke of
[3:13:49] sin
[3:13:50] and from the bondage of this life
[3:13:53] we thank you lord for everything that
[3:13:55] you have done in us today
[3:13:58] we thank you for those that you have
[3:13:59] ministered to personally
[3:14:02] i pray lord that it will bring no
[3:14:04] confusion to them
[3:14:06] but that clarity would come
[3:14:08] i pray that if they should ask for
[3:14:11] understanding
[3:14:13] you would give them understanding
[3:14:20] lord we lift up brother daniel and
[3:14:22] sister anna today
[3:14:24] we love them and we miss them
[3:14:27] some things shifted and they weren't
[3:14:29] able to be here as their trip had to
[3:14:31] start a few hours earlier than what they
[3:14:33] thought
[3:14:34] but lord wherever they are
[3:14:37] most likely streaming this service
[3:14:38] unless they're already on an airplane
[3:14:41] lord i pray for them right now
[3:14:44] that you will strengthen them
[3:14:47] that you will guide them and direct them
[3:14:49] lord
[3:14:51] and that you will heal them
[3:14:54] we are ever more aware
[3:14:57] of the journey of their life
[3:15:00] and what they carry
[3:15:03] the gifts that you have placed in them
[3:15:07] and we see how the enemy opposes them
[3:15:10] and how he would desire
[3:15:13] to attack their life
[3:15:17] the wounds that they carry lord only you
[3:15:20] can kiss them better
[3:15:26] you're the only one that can kiss them
[3:15:28] better
[3:15:32] and i ask you to do that right now
[3:15:35] as only you can jesus
[3:15:37] we pray lord over every person into the
[3:15:39] sound of our voice that
[3:15:41] would have liked prayer maybe in a
[3:15:42] special way that you would come right
[3:15:45] now and minister
[3:15:47] strengthen lord
[3:15:49] their life
[3:15:51] refill them with your spirit
[3:15:55] heal the sick
[3:15:58] whatever you desire to do in this lord
[3:16:00] we want to be surrendered to you
[3:16:05] go with us today in grace and
[3:16:08] keep us until we meet again
[3:16:12] i'm no longer
[3:16:16] [Music]
[3:16:20] i am a child
[3:16:24] of god
[3:16:25] sing it again
[3:16:28] [Music]
[3:16:38] a child of god
[3:16:41] and i'm no longer
[3:16:45] [Music]
[3:16:49] oh
[3:16:50] i am a child
[3:16:53] of god
[3:16:55] one more time
[3:16:58] [Music]
[3:17:07] of god
[3:17:12] i want us just to we're not going to
[3:17:14] embarrass them but i want us just from
[3:17:15] where we are
[3:17:17] it is strange
[3:17:20] for a family to come visit the first
[3:17:22] time and sit here this long
[3:17:26] i would have anticipated you all exiting
[3:17:28] about half an hour ago
[3:17:30] while we were praying
[3:17:32] and it's touched my it's touched me that
[3:17:34] you are still here
[3:17:36] i don't know your needs but jesus does
[3:17:38] but i know you have needs because you're
[3:17:40] human and you're breathing
[3:17:42] i want you just to raise your hand
[3:17:43] toward them i hope it won't embarrass
[3:17:45] them too much
[3:17:47] but right now it wouldn't hardly matter
[3:17:48] because i feel the presence of the lord
[3:17:50] lord
[3:17:51] i don't know this precious family i
[3:17:54] don't know why they passed our way today
[3:17:56] but i'm so thankful that they did
[3:17:58] yes and i don't know why you brought it
[3:18:00] out in my mind like you just did lord
[3:18:02] but i think it's outstanding
[3:18:05] if i was a first-time visitor and the
[3:18:07] service ran this long i most likely
[3:18:09] would have already made my exit
[3:18:12] but something lord i don't know if it
[3:18:14] was respect i i don't know what it was
[3:18:16] but they've lingered to the last minute
[3:18:18] and i just wanted to bless them i just
[3:18:20] want to ask you to touch their lives
[3:18:23] i just want you to surround them with
[3:18:24] your love i just want you to provide for
[3:18:27] them whatever they need strengthen them
[3:18:30] strengthen them i pray in the name of
[3:18:32] jesus
[3:18:34] may they know your love in a tangible
[3:18:36] way
[3:18:38] lord healing
[3:18:40] i thank you that you're a healer
[3:18:42] and you know where the sickness is heal
[3:18:46] as only you can
[3:18:48] lord if it would be your will i pray
[3:18:51] they'll be courageous enough to visit
[3:18:53] this house again
[3:18:55] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[3:18:56] bless them good

[3:19:39] hours earlier than what i had planned to
