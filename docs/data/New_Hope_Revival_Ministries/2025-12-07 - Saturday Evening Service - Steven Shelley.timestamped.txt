[24:30] I've got just one move
[24:35] with my arms stretched wide.
[24:40] Lord, I will worship you.
[24:45] So I throw out my head, Lord. I'll
[24:48] praise you again and again because
[24:52] you're worthy, Lord. Cuz all that I have

[34:48] [Music]
[34:49] Worthy is the lamb.
[34:54] Worthy is the lamb. You are worthy
[34:58] Jesus.
[35:00] Now just use your own words for just a
[35:02] moment as they play. Lord, we just want
[35:04] to say this evening that you are worthy
[35:07] to be praised.
[35:10] It is our great desire and blessing and
[35:14] thrill when we have an opportunity to
[35:17] exalt your name.
[35:19] You are holy in all of your ways.
[35:23] As the writer said among the gods that
[35:25] people worship, there is no God like
[35:29] unto our God. Oh Lord God of Israel,
[35:33] you are the only true living God and we
[35:36] bless your name this evening.
[35:39] To think that you've given us the
[35:41] privilege of being called by your name.
[35:44] Oh Lord,
[35:46] you deserve more than we're capable of
[35:49] giving. But tonight we yield to give you
[35:52] all that we are, all that we have, all
[35:55] that we do. For you are worthy.
[36:00] We bless you tonight, Jesus.
[36:03] In all your ways, you are holy. Why
[36:06] don't you give the Lord a hand clap of
[36:08] praise? Clap your hands,
[36:11] all ye people. He says, shout unto God
[36:14] with a voice of triumph. Hallelujah.
[36:18] &gt;&gt; He lives. He rules. He reigns.
[36:24] You may be seated this evening. He's
[36:26] sovereign.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; He's good.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; He's perfect in all of his ways.
[36:35] &gt;&gt; We find through the years that many
[36:37] people perhaps did not always have the
[36:40] best experience with their earthly dad.
[36:44] And when that is the case, sometimes it
[36:46] becomes very difficult to relate to God
[36:50] as as both your elder brother and your
[36:52] papa. He's both. The Bible tells us he's
[36:57] both our Aba
[36:59] and he's our elder brother.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; And sometimes it's hard for folks to get
[37:04] over their own wound and their own
[37:06] disappointment to be able to relate to
[37:09] him that way. But it's vitally important
[37:12] &gt;&gt; that we learn to love him in all that he
[37:14] is.
[37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not new age or anything like
[37:20] that, but I'll tell you, he's also like
[37:21] a mother.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; And when I say that, I'm just telling
[37:24] you what the scripture said.
[37:26] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "How often I would have
[37:28] gathered you as a hen would her brood
[37:32] &gt;&gt; and you would not." It's his desire to
[37:35] wrap his arms around us.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's a holy God. He's a righteous
[37:39] God
[37:40] &gt;&gt; and he wants a dedicated and consecrated
[37:43] people.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; But he'd much rather love you.
[37:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; And pull you toward him
[37:49] &gt;&gt; than to push you away. If you believe
[37:51] that, say, "Amen."
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; We're going to the Lord in prayer
[37:54] tonight. We have quite a few missing,
[37:56] but we're very thankful that you are
[37:58] here. And some who are here are fighting
[38:01] symptoms and believing that uh that God
[38:04] will give them complete victory. He's
[38:06] still the healer. Yes,
[38:08] &gt;&gt; he really is.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; And some are just facing lots of things
[38:13] and just were not able to be here this
[38:14] evening. Perhaps they'll be able to join
[38:16] us tomorrow. But I'm glad we're here
[38:18] tonight
[38:20] &gt;&gt; for this moment. There's nowhere on the
[38:22] earth I'd rather be
[38:23] &gt;&gt; than right here with you in his presence
[38:26] &gt;&gt; to see what he has for us. Every time we
[38:29] come together,
[38:30] &gt;&gt; he's got something for us.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Lord in prayer. There
[38:34] are many needs right here among us. We
[38:36] want to remember Sister Williams to the
[38:38] Lord and we want to ask the Lord to give
[38:41] her a mighty touch. He's more than able.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; He's more than enough. We want to
[38:46] continue to remember brother Paul Drown
[38:49] who is not well this evening. He's in
[38:51] the hospital and they are looking for
[38:54] his uh what manner of treatment they
[38:57] might use and also what manner of pain
[39:00] management they might be able to give
[39:02] him. His heart is here. And he said,
[39:04] "Brother Shelley, I don't know whether
[39:05] I'll be able to stream tonight, but he
[39:08] said somewhere out there, I'll be given
[39:10] my virtual amen."
[39:13] &gt;&gt; And he I believe that that's who he is.
[39:16] And and I always know if I've spoken to
[39:20] him because he'll he virtually amens.
[39:23] And sometime there'll be 39 amens
[39:26] through a sermon, 39 text, but that's
[39:30] because he he wants to be involved even
[39:32] though he can't be here physically.
[39:34] Let's ask the Lord to give him a mighty
[39:36] touch. I really appreciate brother Paul
[39:40] and what he's meant to us through these
[39:41] years. And let's ask the Lord. God is
[39:44] able.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; There there's nothing that intimidates
[39:47] God. No disease, no no diagnosis
[39:52] causes him to back off.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; He's more than enough. And we want to
[39:57] remember the family that will be
[39:59] traveling. Sister Terry will have um
[40:02] more of her children coming in for the
[40:04] memorial service here Friday evening at
[40:06] 6:00 and then a meal to follow and we
[40:09] want to ask the Lord to comfort their
[40:11] hearts as they as they come. It will be
[40:14] fresh to them. you know, uh, those who
[40:17] have lived here, it's been a few weeks
[40:19] now, and they're still, of course, uh,
[40:22] recognizing and realizing the loss, but
[40:24] those who come who haven't been, well,
[40:26] for them, it'll be fresh. I want to pray
[40:28] that the Lord will just comfort them on
[40:30] the way
[40:31] &gt;&gt; and give them safety as they come, and
[40:33] that he'll move Friday night. Let his
[40:35] presence be so real
[40:37] &gt;&gt; that maybe we just catch some kind of
[40:39] glimpse of of Sister Gert Hammond on the
[40:41] other sides. Bless him, Lord. you know,
[40:45] uh, we really, really appreciate the
[40:47] opportunity to do that. Pray for Brother
[40:49] John tonight that God will strengthen
[40:51] him. He drove a mighty long way. He's
[40:54] just a couple of years, my elder. And,
[40:58] uh, we want to pray that the Lord will
[41:00] so refresh him and renew him tonight.
[41:03] &gt;&gt; Um, what a sacrifice he's made to come
[41:06] that far by himself. Thank you so much,
[41:09] brother. Although we'd rather you
[41:11] brought a, you know, a truckload with
[41:13] you. We're glad you're here this
[41:15] evening. Do you have a unspoken request?
[41:18] You just hold up your hand. The Lord
[41:20] knows. He knows
[41:23] there is a need that's real heavy on my
[41:27] heart tonight. There is a body of
[41:29] believers who need the help of the Lord
[41:31] and the grace of the Lord and the
[41:33] leadership of the Lord. And I'd like to
[41:36] ask God to move as only he can. when he
[41:39] gets involved, when he gets in the
[41:41] arrangements, things can shift.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Please continue to remember the Whitmire
[41:45] family in Edmonton. And those of you may
[41:49] maybe a few of us had an opportunity to
[41:51] stream the service yesterday of Sister
[41:54] Lydia Whitmer who went home to be with
[41:57] the Lord at 90.
[41:59] And Sister Alfreda was giving a eulogy
[42:02] there. And Brother Ed Hammermeister did
[42:05] such a wonderful job. And sister Alfreda
[42:08] was just sort of taking her liberty with
[42:10] her family history and uh it really
[42:14] spoke to me all over again the price
[42:17] that some people have paid to come to
[42:19] the truth.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; You know, some of us haven't lived under
[42:23] threat,
[42:24] &gt;&gt; but they've really paid a price. And to
[42:26] think that there are seven of those nine
[42:29] children who uh who are still alive,
[42:34] that that's incredible. And and at their
[42:37] age, it ranges from about 93 or 94, I
[42:40] think, all the way down. And there's
[42:43] Sister Alfreda talking. And she says,
[42:45] "And and it's hard for me to imagine her
[42:48] 83
[42:50] because it just happened so quick, but
[42:54] would you pray for that family that God
[42:56] will continue to draw every one of them
[42:58] close to him and comfort their hearts
[43:00] and if they need to go deeper that they
[43:02] will, higher, that they will, whatever
[43:04] their needs are." And there are some
[43:06] lost ones among them that God would
[43:07] reach them. He knows how. He's faithful.
[43:11] Can you stand again? Is it too much to
[43:14] ask you? Pastor, I didn't know you were
[43:16] coming. God bless you. What a surprise.
[43:19] Pastor Isaac is here with his family
[43:21] from Indiana. And we're going to ask him
[43:24] to come and pray over the prayer request
[43:25] tonight. And as he comes, would you just
[43:28] sing with me? Have faith in God. Our
[43:31] faith is not in faith. Faith is a
[43:33] powerful powerful powerful thing. But
[43:36] our faith is not in faith. Our faith is
[43:38] in God. Sing that with me as we prepare
[43:41] to pray. Have
[43:44] faith
[43:46] in God.
[43:48] [Music]
[43:51] Oh, have
[43:55] faith
[43:57] in God.
[44:01] Oh, have
[44:05] faith in God for thee serve. Have faith.
[44:13] Lord, our faith is in you tonight. Sing
[44:16] it one more time. Our faith is in the
[44:18] living God this night. Hallelujah. Oh,
[44:23] have
[44:25] have faith
[44:28] in God.
[44:30] No matter what it is, Lord, you know
[44:32] how. Oh, have
[44:35] faith
[44:38] in God.
[44:43] Oh, have
[44:46] have faith
[44:48] in God for the answer.
[44:56] [Music]
[45:03] Amen.
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. Our faith rests in you, Lord.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, when we can't see it, see it, we
[45:10] believe it, Lord.
[45:11] &gt;&gt; Lord, when when things don't line up,
[45:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; in the natural, Lord, we believe that
[45:18] you are already working things out for
[45:21] our good. And Lord, we believe your
[45:23] word. And we have come tonight, Lord, in
[45:26] simple faith, believing your word. Lord,
[45:28] whether things are working out or not,
[45:31] Lord, and these prayer requests, Lord,
[45:33] as we lift them up to you, Lord, the the
[45:36] family that lost a loved one, Lord, and
[45:38] and Lord,
[45:43] &gt;&gt; we know how it feels.
[45:46] &gt;&gt; And Lord, we know that you care for each
[45:49] one.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; And so, Lord, lift them up. We lift them
[45:52] up to you, Lord. And we ask that you
[45:54] touch them, that you encourage them, and
[45:56] Lord, that as as one by one they leave
[45:59] us, Lord, Lord, that we can step up and
[46:02] that we can be the light, that we can be
[46:05] that we can take on the torch, that we
[46:08] can be the fire burning in our day,
[46:12] Lord. That we can be the demonstrators
[46:16] of your word in our day, Lord. that we
[46:19] can simply rest
[46:22] &gt;&gt; in you
[46:24] &gt;&gt; and Lord then fight
[46:26] &gt;&gt; as only you could have us fight
[46:29] &gt;&gt; grant it Lord
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Lord help us Lord help our brother as he
[46:33] comes and brings the word Lord that the
[46:36] Holy Ghost on fire Lord that it be
[46:38] something Lord that it was for the
[46:40] apostles when they when they got out of
[46:42] the upper room Lord where they came out
[46:45] Lord not of themselves Lord but where
[46:47] the people wondered ed in amazement,
[46:49] Lord, at what came forth of their lips,
[46:52] Lord, knowing that never a man spake
[46:55] like this man. Never a man spake like
[46:58] this, Lord. Lord, this is strange. Lord,
[47:01] let it be that it touches hearts and
[47:02] minds. Lord, we've come. We've given you
[47:05] our all. So, Lord, have your way in this
[47:09] place. I thank you for everyone here,
[47:11] Lord, for healing for the ones that are
[47:13] battling. Lord, we ask for healing. We
[47:16] ask for deliverance. We ask for your
[47:17] grace.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; As we continue on.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord
[47:22] &gt;&gt; in Jesus name.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The answer is on the way.
[47:29] Amen.
[47:32] Sing this before you're seated. Oh yes.
[47:34] The answer's on the way. This I know.
[47:40] Jesus said it. I believe it. And it's
[47:43] so. Our heavenly father knows the need
[47:48] before we pray.
[47:50] And you can rest assure the answer's on
[47:54] the way.
[47:56] Oh yes, the answer's on the way. This I
[48:00] know.
[48:02] Jesus said it. I believe it and it's so.
[48:07] Our heavenly father, he knows the need
[48:10] before we pray. And we can rest assured
[48:15] the answers on the way. One more time.
[48:19] Oh yes, the answers.
[48:23] Lord, I believe in you, Lord.
[48:26] I believe it and it's so
[48:30] for our heavenly father knows the need
[48:34] for we pray.
[48:37] Rest assured the answers on the way.
[48:42] And you can rest assured the answers all
[48:47] the way. I believe it.
[48:50] &gt;&gt; Why don't you praise the one who brings
[48:52] the answers? Lord, we thank you.
[48:56] Amen.
[48:59] Thank you, Jesus.
[49:01] You may be seated this evening. We're
[49:04] sure glad to have brother Jordan and his
[49:07] family with us this evening. and they
[49:09] took a few days holiday and they didn't
[49:13] the last thing I said to him was take me
[49:15] with you
[49:18] but he he he said okay maybe but didn't
[49:21] make much effort
[49:23] but I'm glad they came back to be in
[49:25] service with us this evening I just know
[49:28] that God's got something
[49:31] &gt;&gt; and if it's him it's good
[49:33] &gt;&gt; what a good good papa Jonathan are you
[49:36] feeling well why don't you come real
[49:43] I know you've been around brother Gley
[49:45] and he wasn't feeling well and I didn't
[49:47] know if you give it to him or something,
[49:49] you know.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; Then Kate will come right after and sing
[49:57] and brother Thornton has all night,
[50:01] &gt;&gt; all the time he needs.
[50:08] Well, we don't really know but one.
[50:09] It'll be that one.
[50:12] But uh I I looked so hard to find a
[50:14] quote. I wanted to read a quote. And you
[50:18] need to know how you file things. You
[50:21] understand?
[50:23] And and sometimes I file them so good I
[50:26] can never see them again. And that's
[50:28] kind of what I did. But brother Brandon
[50:30] was talking about angels.
[50:32] We don't worship angels. And I don't
[50:34] pray to angels and I don't tell angels
[50:37] what to do, but I like them.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; I'm very thankful to know that I've got
[50:42] some
[50:43] &gt;&gt; helping me out.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; I remember one time, Brother Perry Green
[50:48] got stirred up about angels.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; And if he got stirred up about
[50:52] something, he wanted everybody to be
[50:54] stirred up about it. And he preached s
[50:57] several services in a row on angels. And
[51:00] then he began to tell one story right
[51:02] after another. Some that he had never
[51:05] told publicly before. But he got bold
[51:07] enough. He had preached himself to
[51:09] really believe in in angels. You know,
[51:11] he got so inspired and he started
[51:14] sharing testimonies that he had some
[51:17] never shared before about how angels had
[51:19] assisted him and ministered to him.
[51:21] Help. All the praise goes to God,
[51:23] &gt;&gt; not the angels. But isn't it good to
[51:26] know they're camped around us?
[51:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:29] Every now and again, we can kind of
[51:31] sense that there's something of another
[51:33] world. We don't know what to call it or
[51:36] maybe don't always see it with our eyes.
[51:39] But the quotation was something like
[51:41] this. You know, we don't see them
[51:42] because we don't believe in them. That's
[51:44] what he said.
[51:45] &gt;&gt; But if we would believe in them, we
[51:47] might get an opportunity. I don't have
[51:50] to see them to believe in them,
[51:52] &gt;&gt; but we might get an opportunity just to
[51:54] catch a little glimpse. If our eyes
[51:56] could be open tonight, we would see that
[51:58] this room is far more crowded than what
[52:00] we realize
[52:02] &gt;&gt; because they're with us. You believe
[52:03] that?
[52:04] &gt;&gt; When I'm broken from the battle
[52:09] and I've lost a another round,
[52:14] Satan whispers to my troubled mind. Oh,
[52:20] lay your armor now.
[52:24] Where are those that you loved and
[52:27] trusted?
[52:29] Look around you. They are gone.
[52:34] Would be easy to surrender
[52:39] when you're standing all alone. But I
[52:44] see a great band of angels camping
[52:50] around me.
[52:53] I see the captain rising up this
[52:58] challenge
[53:00] to me. Oh yes. And I know I'm safe from
[53:06] harm when I'm touching Jesus.
[53:12] Oh no. The battle is his but the victory
[53:16] is mine and victory is sweet.
[53:21] [Music]
[53:23] So I bowed my head in sadness while I
[53:29] pondered what to do.
[53:33] I've been in God's army for so long.
[53:38] I've tried to be a soldier true.
[53:43] That's when I hear a sweet voice from
[53:46] heaven
[53:48] saying, "Pilgrim,
[53:50] it is I."
[53:53] Lift your head and take you courage.
[53:58] Lift your eyes toward the sky. And I see
[54:03] a great band of angels
[54:08] all around.
[54:10] Thank God. Oh, and I see my captain
[54:15] rising up his challenge to me.
[54:22] And I know I'm safe
[54:25] from heart when I'm touching Jesus.
[54:31] Oh, the battle is but the victory is
[54:36] mine. Victory is sweet. Listen again.
[54:42] Then I bowed my head in sadness
[54:48] while I ponder
[54:50] what to do.
[54:52] Oh, I've been in God's army for so long.
[54:58] I've tried to be a soldier. True.
[55:02] That's when I hear a sweet voice from
[55:06] heaven saying, "Pilgrim,
[55:09] it is I."
[55:12] Lift your head and take new courage.
[55:17] Lift your eyes toward the sky. Oh, I see
[55:22] your rain
[55:25] [Music]
[55:28] on Abraham
[55:29] protecting us from harm. I see my
[55:32] captain rising up this challenge to me.
[55:40] Well, then I know I'm save
[55:46] when I'm touching Jesus.
[55:51] For the battle is his, but the victory
[55:55] is mine. I know the battle is his, but
[55:59] the victory. I said the battle is his,
[56:03] but the victory is mine. And victory is
[56:08] sweet.
[56:15] Yes, it is.
[56:17] It's not our victory.
[56:20] It's not our battle.
[56:23] The battle is the Lord's.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; Your turn.
[56:43] Praise the Lord Jesus.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[56:55] [Music]
[56:58] &gt;&gt; You should have just stayed here. You
[56:59] should have stayed and sang.
[57:01] [Music]
[57:19] If you have some questions
[57:22] in the corners of your mind,
[57:27] places of discouragement
[57:31] and peace you cannot find,
[57:35] reflections of your past seem to face
[57:40] you every day.
[57:43] But there's one thing that I do know and
[57:46] that's Jesus is the way.
[57:51] Jesus is the answer
[57:55] for the world today.
[57:59] Above him there's no other.
[58:03] Jesus is the way.
[58:06] [Music]
[58:07] Jesus, he's the answer
[58:11] for the world today.
[58:15] Above them, there's no other.
[58:19] Jesus is the way.
[58:25] I know you got those mountains that you
[58:29] think you cannot climb.
[58:33] I know your skies are dark and you think
[58:37] the sun won't shine.
[58:41] In case that you don't know that the
[58:45] word of God is true,
[58:49] well everything that he promised us, I
[58:52] know that he will do it for you.
[58:56] Oh, Jesus is the answer
[59:01] for the world today. Yes, above him
[59:06] there's no other.
[59:09] Jesus is the way. Oh, Jesus is the
[59:15] answer
[59:17] for the world today.
[59:20] Oh, above him there's no other.
[59:25] Jesus is the way.
[59:31] I know you got those mountains that you
[59:35] think you cannot climb.
[59:39] I know your skies are dark and you think
[59:43] the sun won't shine.
[59:46] In case that you don't know that the
[59:50] word of God is true,
[59:54] &gt;&gt; well, everything that he promises, I
[59:58] know that he will do it for you.
[1:00:02] Jesus is the answer
[1:00:06] for the world today. Oh, above him
[1:00:11] there's no other.
[1:00:13] Oh Jesus is the way.
[1:00:17] Oh Jesus, he's my answer
[1:00:21] for the world today. Oh above him there
[1:00:27] is no other.
[1:00:29] Oh Jesus is the way.
[1:00:33] [Music]
[1:00:36] Jesus is the answer
[1:00:39] for the world today.
[1:00:43] Oh, above him there is no other.
[1:00:47] And Jesus is the way.
[1:00:51] Oh Jesus, he's the answer
[1:00:55] for the world today. Oh, above him
[1:01:00] there's no other.
[1:01:03] Oh, Jesus is the way.
[1:01:11] You thought I was worth saving,
[1:01:15] [Music]
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; so you came and changed my life. You
[1:01:20] thought I was worth keeping,
[1:01:24] &gt;&gt; so you clean me up inside. You thought I
[1:01:28] was to die
[1:01:30] for.
[1:01:32] So you sacrifice your life so I could be
[1:01:37] free. So I could be whole. And I can
[1:01:40] tell everyone I know. You thought I was
[1:01:44] worth saving.
[1:01:48] You came and changed my life. You
[1:01:51] thought I was worth keeping.
[1:01:55] Oh, so you clean me up inside. You
[1:01:59] thought I was to die for.
[1:02:04] So you sacrificed your life so I could
[1:02:08] be free. so I could be whole. And I can
[1:02:12] tell everyone I know you thought I was
[1:02:16] worth saving.
[1:02:19] Oh, so you came and changed my life. You
[1:02:23] thought I was worth keeping.
[1:02:27] So you clean me up inside. You thought I
[1:02:31] was to die for.
[1:02:34] Oh, so you sacrifice your life so I
[1:02:39] could be free and I could be whole and I
[1:02:43] can tell everyone. Oh,
[1:02:47] say hallelujah.

[1:03:10] free. Because I am whole. And I can tell
[1:03:15] everyone. Oh. Somebody say hallelujah.
[1:03:20] Hallelujah.

[1:04:15] whole. And I can tell everyone I know.
[1:04:20] Because I am free. Because I am whole.
[1:04:24] And I will tell everyone I know.
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. Lord.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you that you thought I was worth
[1:04:33] saving. Lord, I like it. I like it. Oh,
[1:04:38] look what you've done, Lord, in our
[1:04:40] lives. We give you praise and honor and
[1:04:43] glory.
[1:04:47] You You can tell that I don't lead
[1:04:49] services very often. They said, "You you
[1:04:52] better take up an offering. Can we do it
[1:04:54] at the end? Will you all remind me and
[1:04:56] we'll put a bag at the back? I don't
[1:04:58] want to disturb what I feel right now.
[1:05:00] Come on, Brother John Thornton.
[1:05:04] And just do whatever God puts in your
[1:05:06] heart. Sing, preach, jump, whatever. We
[1:05:10] We're ready for whatever the Lord has.
[1:05:12] God bless you.
[1:05:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, saints.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to be in the house of the
[1:05:20] Lord tonight.
[1:05:22] Brother Steve asked me that I want to
[1:05:24] stay in the back for a little while.
[1:05:27] How could you do that?
[1:05:30] How could you stay back there with all
[1:05:31] this going on out here?
[1:05:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I'll let you be
[1:05:35] seated for a moment. You found out the
[1:05:37] last time I was here, I'm not a singer.
[1:05:40] Uh for whatever reason over the years, I
[1:05:43] have lost that voice. It's hard to think
[1:05:46] that at one time I thought I could sing.
[1:05:49] Amen. But you know, it's just so good to
[1:05:52] to be here tonight. I I don't say this
[1:05:56] carelessly or nonchalant. It is such an
[1:06:00] honor and a privilege to be able to
[1:06:03] stand here in front of you people and be
[1:06:05] part of this service. Uh I just love
[1:06:08] you.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I wished I could I wish I knew
[1:06:12] every one of you by name. You know,
[1:06:14] Brother Brandham said, "There are some
[1:06:16] people that you like to be around. You
[1:06:18] just like to sit down and have coffee
[1:06:19] with."
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's the way I feel about
[1:06:22] you people. My son Adam and I, a lot of
[1:06:24] times we talk and we we raised the
[1:06:28] question, "What if God would move us out
[1:06:30] of Durham? Where would we go?" You're at
[1:06:32] the very top of the list. I can tell you
[1:06:37] you and one more place are running a
[1:06:39] real close race, but we certainly will.
[1:06:43] [Music]
[1:06:44] We wouldn't want to do that unless the
[1:06:46] Lord said so. But I'm tell you what, we
[1:06:48] we love you and the family is so
[1:06:51] disappointed tonight that they couldn't
[1:06:53] come and and be here with us. But I
[1:06:55] promised them that I would make a
[1:06:57] special trip just to bring them back to
[1:06:59] be in service with you. They enjoyed it
[1:07:01] so much. I I love the way you worship.
[1:07:04] Uh you know, you you do know you have a
[1:07:07] reputation, right?
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; It goes before you. It's kind of like
[1:07:10] the guys that were standing outside
[1:07:12] talking earlier debating about whether
[1:07:14] or not they wanted to come in the church
[1:07:15] tonight or not. And and one of them was
[1:07:18] debating. He says, "I I don't want to go
[1:07:20] in there." He said, "I, you know, I just
[1:07:23] uh those people, they get excited and
[1:07:26] whatever. I just you telling the other
[1:07:29] guy, you just go on in and I'll stay out
[1:07:31] here." And they were back and forth and
[1:07:34] whatever. I said, "You know, I was down
[1:07:35] at a church a couple of weeks ago and
[1:07:38] they were quiet. They they preach love
[1:07:41] everybody and don't offend anybody. They
[1:07:43] even had a coffee bar and donuts." He
[1:07:45] said, "Boy, that was really nice." He
[1:07:47] said, "That's the kind of church I like
[1:07:49] to go to, but those people in there,
[1:07:51] they just get all excited and you just
[1:07:53] don't know what's going to happen." He
[1:07:55] said, "One minute they're raising their
[1:07:57] hands and shouting and praising the
[1:07:58] Lord. They may dance. They may even get
[1:08:00] up and run and whatever." Did you happen
[1:08:03] to see what happened to to to Joe last
[1:08:06] week that went? Well, you might know him
[1:08:08] as disbelief. Said he came out of that
[1:08:10] church looking like a practice dummy for
[1:08:13] the Crimson Tide blocking tackle. Amen.
[1:08:16] Said they just beat him up like you
[1:08:18] wouldn't ever said those people even
[1:08:20] will take the boss's name and write it
[1:08:22] on the bottom of their foot and run all
[1:08:25] OVER THE CHURCH SAYING, "DEVIL, YOU
[1:08:27] BELONG under the bottom of my feet."
[1:08:29] See, that's the kind of repetition you
[1:08:31] have people have created. Aren't you
[1:08:34] glad for that?
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Well, you know where I was going with
[1:08:36] that, don't you? But that's I don't see
[1:08:38] them in here tonight. I don't imagine
[1:08:40] they're hanging around too much. Not
[1:08:42] with what's been going on. Amen.
[1:08:45] I I really feel embarrassed to try to
[1:08:47] sing with all these singers and
[1:08:49] musicians. Let's try F if we could. F
[1:08:51] chord of the mountain.
[1:08:56] You know this song, I'm sure. So help me
[1:08:58] sing it if you would. Life is easy
[1:09:04] when you're up on a mountain.
[1:09:10] And you've got peace
[1:09:13] of mind
[1:09:16] like you've never known.
[1:09:20] [Music]
[1:09:22] But things will change.
[1:09:25] And
[1:09:27] you're down in the valley.
[1:09:31] [Music]
[1:09:32] Church, don't lose hope.
[1:09:39] For you're never alone.
[1:09:44] For the God of the mountain,
[1:09:49] [Music]
[1:09:50] he's still born in the valley.
[1:09:55] [Music]
[1:09:56] When things go wrong,
[1:10:02] oh, he'll make them right.
[1:10:08] And the God of the good
[1:10:11] times,
[1:10:13] he's still gone in the bad
[1:10:17] time.
[1:10:20] The God of the day,
[1:10:25] he's still God in the night. I believe
[1:10:30] that. Don't you?
[1:10:32] You talk of faith
[1:10:35] wind.
[1:10:37] Oh, we're up on a mountain
[1:10:41] town.
[1:10:43] Listen, but talk comes easy
[1:10:49] when life saves.
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:10:55] Now you're down in the valley
[1:11:01] of trials and temptation.
[1:11:04] [Music]
[1:11:07] Oh, that's where your faith
[1:11:13] is really put to the test.
[1:11:19] Oh, the call of the mountain.
[1:11:25] Oh, he's gone in the valley.
[1:11:31] Oh, when things go wrong,
[1:11:36] I know it. Oh, he'll make them right.
[1:11:43] And the God of the good
[1:11:47] time.
[1:11:49] He's still gone in the bad
[1:11:53] time.
[1:11:56] the God of the day.
[1:12:01] He's still gone in the night. Let's sing
[1:12:05] it from our heart. Oh God,
[1:12:09] [Music]
[1:12:13] he's still God in the valley.
[1:12:19] Oh, when things go wrong,
[1:12:25] oh, he'll make them right.
[1:12:31] And the God of the good
[1:12:35] time.
[1:12:37] He's still God in the bad
[1:12:41] time.
[1:12:44] The God of the day.
[1:12:50] He's still God in the night.
[1:12:53] [Music]
[1:12:56] The God of the day.
[1:13:00] [Music]
[1:13:02] He's still my God in the night.
[1:13:08] Glory to God. Amen. Do you believe that?
[1:13:12] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:13:16] I believe that, you know, the
[1:13:18] Philistines and the God haters always
[1:13:20] thought if they could get the children
[1:13:21] of God into the valley, they could
[1:13:23] overcome. They said, you know, he we
[1:13:26] know he fights for him on the mountain,
[1:13:27] but if we can get him in the valley, we
[1:13:29] got a chance. Well, when Goliath got in
[1:13:31] the valley, he found out that didn't
[1:13:33] work too well, did he?
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. He found out that the God on the
[1:13:36] mountain was the one that was in the
[1:13:38] valley of Eli. Amen. It doesn't matter
[1:13:40] what we're going through. And I and
[1:13:42] maybe I'm the only ones. Anybody ever
[1:13:43] been through a battle?
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; Sure you have. But you've always come
[1:13:47] out because you trusted God.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Believe him today. I appreciate him so
[1:13:51] much today. Amen. We won't keep you
[1:13:54] standing. If you have your Bibles, I I
[1:13:58] don't preach like anybody else.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; And uh you'll find that out very
[1:14:02] quickly. And uh I I beat myself up over
[1:14:06] that a lot of times, brother Greley,
[1:14:08] because I I kind of feel like I want to
[1:14:10] be better than I ever am. I I employ a
[1:14:14] whole lot of life into what I say and
[1:14:16] the whole lot of my experiences in what
[1:14:19] I say and a whole lot of things I have
[1:14:21] experienced. And let me tell you
[1:14:23] something. At my age, I have experienced
[1:14:25] it. I've experienced it all. I've seen
[1:14:27] the good, the bad, the ugly. Amen. I've
[1:14:30] been beat up by the devil. I've been
[1:14:31] told that I was going to die. I've been
[1:14:33] within 20 minutes of bleeding to death
[1:14:35] and I'm still standing
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; because God knew that I was going to
[1:14:39] love him.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I know that you feel the same
[1:14:42] way today. But we just appreciate him so
[1:14:44] much. And and I won't be lengthy. I
[1:14:47] promise I won't be long. I'm not a long-
[1:14:49] winded preacher. Amen. But it's not the
[1:14:53] length of it, but it's what God has to
[1:14:55] say in his word.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians chapter one. Amen. We'll
[1:15:00] just read maybe one verse there and then
[1:15:02] we'll go over to
[1:15:04] Amen.
[1:15:06] a little further over and get another
[1:15:11] verse of scripture here.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; Ephesians chapter 1. I want to read
[1:15:16] verse number four. You probably can
[1:15:17] quote it by heart. According as he has
[1:15:20] chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:15:23] of the world that we should be holy.
[1:15:26] Everybody say holy. that we should be
[1:15:28] holy and without blame. Without blame
[1:15:31] before him in love. Can you say amen?
[1:15:34] And if you'll turn over just a few
[1:15:37] verses or chapter over to uh second
[1:15:40] Timothy. Amen. Chapter one. We'll read a
[1:15:44] couple of verses for you there and then
[1:15:46] let you have your seat. Verse number
[1:15:48] nine. Who hath saved us and called us
[1:15:52] with a holy calling not according to our
[1:15:55] work. Amen. but according to his own
[1:15:58] purpose and by grace which was given us
[1:16:02] in Christ Jesus before the world began,
[1:16:05] but is now made manifest by the
[1:16:07] appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ,
[1:16:11] who hath abolished death and have
[1:16:13] brought life and immortality to light
[1:16:15] through the gospel. Amen. May God have
[1:16:18] his blessings on the word today as
[1:16:20] you're seated. Amen. And again, we just
[1:16:23] appreciate the Lord and uh uh letting us
[1:16:26] be here today. I had a beautiful lunch
[1:16:29] with Brother Shelley and the boys today.
[1:16:31] I felt like royalty. Amen. I'm not used
[1:16:35] to all that that elite treatment and
[1:16:37] stuff. Amen. But it was just a such a
[1:16:41] privilege and and not just Brother
[1:16:42] Shelley and whatever. And you know, with
[1:16:44] ministry like you have here, Brother
[1:16:46] Shelley and Brother Greley. Amen.
[1:16:48] There's nothing that I have new to say.
[1:16:50] And let me warn you of that firsthand.
[1:16:52] If you come looking for something new,
[1:16:54] you're out of luck. I don't have
[1:16:56] anything new to tell you. Amen. We read
[1:16:59] the same Bible. We We hear the same
[1:17:01] message. We hear the same preaching over
[1:17:03] and over and over again. So, I don't
[1:17:05] have anything new to tell you today.
[1:17:07] Amen. But if I can stir your mind, if I
[1:17:10] can encourage you to know that whatever
[1:17:12] you're going through, whatever you face,
[1:17:14] whatever you you think you might face,
[1:17:16] God has the answer today. Amen. because
[1:17:19] he chose you before the foundation of
[1:17:21] the world. I'm not here by chance,
[1:17:24] church. You're not here by by by just
[1:17:26] happen stance. You're here because God
[1:17:29] ordained that you be here.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm a I grew up in the days of Roy
[1:17:34] Rogers and the Long Ranger and Gene
[1:17:36] Altry and and and all those days and
[1:17:38] some of the young people looking at me
[1:17:40] saying, "Who in the world is that?" So,
[1:17:42] I'm I'm a real old western type guy. I
[1:17:44] like the Old West and I like the
[1:17:46] westerns and I like reading about the
[1:17:48] Old West. And I was reading an article
[1:17:50] not long ago and I came across a a a
[1:17:54] statement and it was uh concerning uh 19
[1:17:59] 1845 a man by the name of John Sullivan
[1:18:02] coined a phrase called
[1:18:05] manifest destiny. And I thought that's
[1:18:08] interesting. I'll begin to read a little
[1:18:10] bit about it. And what that what that
[1:18:12] term referred to with with Mr. Sullivan
[1:18:15] was that the early settlers that lived
[1:18:17] in the east coast had a right to to go
[1:18:21] west and to occupy the land and to
[1:18:24] create worlds and citiz and and country
[1:18:26] uh uh towns and all of that. And it was
[1:18:29] obvious. Amen. And it was their destiny
[1:18:32] that WAS WHAT IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE. AND
[1:18:34] I THOUGHT, WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT KIND OF
[1:18:35] LIKE THE BRIDE, you know, we have a
[1:18:36] destiny also. Amen. We didn't just we're
[1:18:39] NOT JUST UH PLAYING this thing by ear.
[1:18:42] It was all laid OUT BEFORE BEFORE IT
[1:18:44] EVER HAPPENED. AMEN. And you know,
[1:18:46] Brother Brandham said, "YOU'RE NOT
[1:18:48] SOMETHING BECAUSE you want to be
[1:18:49] something." Amen. You're not somebody
[1:18:51] BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE SOMEBODY. You're
[1:18:54] somebody in who you are because God
[1:18:56] ordained you to be that person. Amen.
[1:18:59] You are what you are because, Amen.
[1:19:02] God's will made you to be that way. All
[1:19:05] of us want the will of God. We know that
[1:19:07] today. I mean, there's none of us
[1:19:09] sitting here today that would wake up
[1:19:11] one morning and say, "I don't want to be
[1:19:12] in the will of God." It's always, "I
[1:19:15] want to be in the will of God." And we
[1:19:17] know those gifts and those callings OF
[1:19:19] GOD ARE WITHOUT REPENTANCE. THEY'RE
[1:19:21] THERE. AMEN. And they're PART OF US
[1:19:23] BECAUSE OF THE FORNOWLEDGE OF GOD. NOW,
[1:19:26] I DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH A a school
[1:19:28] lesson. We all know what fornowledge
[1:19:30] means. It means to be to know something.
[1:19:32] Amen. Before it ever happens.
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. To be aware of it. The Greek word
[1:19:38] for that word is prognosis if I
[1:19:40] pronounce it right. AND WHAT THAT MEANS
[1:19:42] IS IT it means reality before it becomes
[1:19:46] real.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if you apply that with a with
[1:19:50] religious theology, AMEN. It's it refers
[1:19:54] to all knowing omniscient.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. The nature of our God. AMEN.
[1:20:00] REALITY BEFORE IT BECAME REAL, EVENTS
[1:20:02] BEFORE THEY HAPPENED, and people before
[1:20:05] they were. Amen. See, we didn't just get
[1:20:08] here today. We've been here all the
[1:20:10] time. Amen. We We were in God before his
[1:20:13] forn knowledge. Let me read you what
[1:20:15] Psalm that the psalmist David said.
[1:20:17] Psalms 139:15.
[1:20:20] HE SAID, "MY SUBSTANCE WAS NOT HID from
[1:20:23] thee."
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing hid from God. Amen. WHEN I
[1:20:27] WAS MADE IN secret and curiosity wrought
[1:20:30] in the lowest parts of the earth, thine
[1:20:33] eyes DID SEE ME. AMEN. AND THINE THAN
[1:20:35] EYES THAT SEE my substance. YET BEING UN

[1:25:34] of people, amen, to understand. But if
[1:25:36] you got a if you have a revelation,
[1:25:39] amen, of the knowledge of fornowledge of

[1:26:13] WHAT WOULD A MAN GIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR
[1:26:15] HIS SOUL?
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL THE WEALTH AND THE riches of
[1:26:18] this world could never amount to
[1:26:20] anything if you lose your soul with God.
[1:26:24] Amen. By fornowledge, God, Amen, would
[1:26:26] know and he would he would be able to to
[1:26:28] look at you AND AND THE PROPHET SAID,
[1:26:30] AMEN. THAT YOU are a bride.
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Not because you chose to BE A BRIDE, NOT
[1:26:36] BECAUSE you wanted to BE A BRIDE, BUT
[1:26:38] YOU'RE BRIDE BECAUSE GOD ORDAINED YOU TO
[1:26:40] BE THE BRIDE. AMEN. And you could have
[1:26:42] never been anything else. Amen. BECAUSE
[1:26:44] BEFORE THE FORNOWLEDGE OF GOD, GOD BROKE
[1:26:46] THAT LITTLE PIECE OF HIM OFF. AMEN. AND
[1:26:48] WHEN HE SAID, "LET US MAKE MAN IN OUR
[1:26:51] IMAGE." HE WAS TALKING ABOUT ME. HE WAS
[1:26:53] TALKING ABOUT YOU.

[1:26:57] THE BREATH OF LIFE, AMEN, INTO THAT MAN
[1:27:00] CALLED ADAM, HE ALREADY MADE HIM A A A a

[1:27:05] that breath of life in it, he became a
[1:27:07] living soul. Amen. You and I began to
[1:27:11] live.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Now, you might say, "Well, look at what
[1:27:13] happened to us." Yeah, we were we were
[1:27:15] we were lost. We were condemned. We were
[1:27:17] we were put on a downward track, amen,
[1:27:20] by the condemn. We were condemned by
[1:27:22] somebody else representation.
[1:27:24] But that's why not what God condemns us
[1:27:26] for. He doesn't condemn us or or send
[1:27:28] us, Amen. cause us to be lost because we
[1:27:32] were condemned or we were represented by
[1:27:35] someone else that transgressed God.
[1:27:37] Amen. because we're also represented by
[1:27:40] somebody else. AMEN. THAT BROUGHT US
[1:27:42] BACK TO GOD. THROUGH THAT FIRST MAN,
[1:27:44] ADAM, AMEN, this world WENT INTO SIN.
[1:27:47] BUT THROUGH THAT SECOND MAN, ADAM, WE
[1:27:49] GOT BACK TO WHERE WE BEL LISTEN CHURCH.
[1:27:51] I don't know about you, but I'm not on
[1:27:53] I'm not on my way back to Eden. I'm not
[1:27:56] on my way back TO HERE. I'M ON MY WAY
[1:27:58] BACK TO GOD.
[1:28:00] Let me let ME TELL YOU THIS. IT'S NOT
[1:28:03] HOW GOOD YOU ARE.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; It's not how bad you were. It's where
[1:28:08] did you come from? IF YOU CAME FROM GOD,
[1:28:10] you're going BACK TO GOD. IF YOU WERE
[1:28:13] NOT WITH GOD IN THE FORNOWLEDGE, YOU'LL
[1:28:15] NEVER BE BACK THERE WITH HIM in the end.
[1:28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; It's where we came from. IT'S WHERE
[1:28:21] WE'RE GOING TODAY.
[1:28:23] &gt;&gt; How many say amen? You didn't make
[1:28:25] yourself bride.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; You can't make yourself bright. You
[1:28:28] can't make yourself a believer.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Shelley mentioned it today
[1:28:32] at at lunch. There are some people that
[1:28:35] Amen. JUST LABOR SO HARD TRYING TO LIVE
[1:28:38] GOD. TRYING TO LIVE.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; Why are you trying to do it?
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN DO. IT'S NOT
[1:28:44] WITHIN MY ABILITY TO LIVE FOR GOD. WHEN
[1:28:46] I LOOK IN THE MIRROR IN THE MORNING,
[1:28:48] EVERYTHING I SEE, BROTHER GLEY, AMEN, IS
[1:28:51] CONTRARY to God.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN. EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS FLESH IS
[1:28:54] CONTRARY TO GOD. THERE'S NOTHING IN ME.
[1:28:57] AMEN. THAT MAKES me want to worship God
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; except the God that's in me.
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. See what we're doing. We're trying
[1:29:04] to do it oursself. And you'll never be
[1:29:07] able to do it. You'll never be a success
[1:29:08] in living for God. Amen. You've got to
[1:29:11] have him on the inside. Amen. You got to
[1:29:13] be changed from that old creature. Amen.
[1:29:15] To a new new creature. I heard you give
[1:29:18] a little story one time years and years
[1:29:20] ago about a pig. Amen. That was up on
[1:29:22] somebody's porch and they were getting
[1:29:24] him ready for getting him ready for a
[1:29:26] fair, I BELIEVE, AND they polished his
[1:29:28] his uh his uh toenails and got him all
[1:29:31] CLEANED UP AND LOOKING. HE LOOKED at
[1:29:32] brother Sheldon and he looked at that
[1:29:34] mud hole. He looked at brother Sheldon
[1:29:35] and he looked at that mud hole and all
[1:29:37] of a sudden he JUMPED OFF THAT PORCH AND
[1:29:39] BACK TO THAT MUD HOLE HE WENT. WHY?
[1:29:41] BECAUSE THAT WAS WHAT HE WAS BORN FOR.
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; And if you were not BORN FOR THIS,
[1:29:46] YOU'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO MAKE IT TODAY.
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You're never going to make IT IN
[1:29:51] OURSELVES. WE'RE NEVER GOING TO MAKE IT
[1:29:53] in ourselves.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; And you're only secure.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're only secure as long as you
[1:30:01] stay in him.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. I I see people today and I WONDER
[1:30:05] THEY'RE FIGHTING SO HARD TO get away out
[1:30:07] of the message. They're looking for
[1:30:09] quote to justify Amen. getting away from
[1:30:11] the truth. They're trying as much as
[1:30:13] THEY CAN TO NOT believe it. IF THEY TRY
[1:30:15] THAT HARD TO BELIEVE IT, BOY, THEY'D BE
[1:30:17] ON THE top of the mountain all the time.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what happens to them. BUT
[1:30:22] YOU LISTEN, THERE'S A TIME TO STAY IN
[1:30:24] THE BOAT AND THERE'S A TIME TO GET OUT
[1:30:26] OF THE BOAT. AMEN. YOU STAY IN THE BOAT
[1:30:28] UNTIL JESUS tells you to get out of it.
[1:30:31] Amen. The ch the the disciples WERE
[1:30:33] ROWING ONE TIME. AMEN. THE THE storm was
[1:30:35] raging and they forgot THAT JESUS WAS IN
[1:30:37] THE BOAT. THAT WAS A GOOD TIME TO STAY
[1:30:39] THERE.
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; But then there was another time when he
[1:30:42] came walking ON THE WATER. PETER LOOKED
[1:30:44] OUT AND SAW HIM SAID, "LORD, IF THAT'S
[1:30:46] YOU, LET ME GO. TIME TO GET OUT OF THE
[1:30:48] BOAT."
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I can only imagine Andrew and John
[1:30:54] and the other disciples and Peter's
[1:30:58] getting ready to grab his coat up around
[1:31:00] him and getting ready to step over in
[1:31:01] the boat and they're grabbing him by his
[1:31:03] coat said, "Are you a crazy? Are you a
[1:31:05] fool?" Amen. YOU'RE GOING TO DROWN IF
[1:31:07] YOU DO THAT. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE people
[1:31:08] told you, "You're a fool for believing
[1:31:10] THIS MESSAGE. YOU'RE A FOOL FOR ACTING
[1:31:12] LIKE YOU DO. YOU'RE A fool for going to
[1:31:14] a church like that." Amen. Let me TELL
[1:31:16] YOU SOMETHING. BEING A FOOL HAS CARRIED
[1:31:18] ME A WHOLE LOT FURTHER IN GOD, AMEN,
[1:31:20] than I would have ever been if I had not
[1:31:22] been a fool for Christ.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; When Peter came back into the boat and
[1:31:31] they drugg him over, pulled him over in
[1:31:32] the B boat, Andrew probably looked at
[1:31:34] him and said, "Peter said, YOU'RE A
[1:31:37] FOOL. YOU COULD HAVE DROWNED OUT THERE."
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; Peter probably looked at Andrew and
[1:31:40] said, "Andrew, you ever walked on
[1:31:42] water?" Yeah.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Say, see, being a fool sometime will
[1:31:45] take you a lot further, Amen. than you
[1:31:47] would any other time.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that the word that word fool
[1:31:51] is doesn't always have a negative
[1:31:52] meaning to it. You know, you could be
[1:31:54] just a fool for Christ. That Amen.
[1:31:57] There's nothing like being a fool for
[1:31:58] Christ, is it?
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we're only secure as long AS
[1:32:02] WE STAY IN THE BOAT. AMEN. NOT OUTSIDE
[1:32:05] RIDING ON THE BOW. AMEN. Looking at the
[1:32:07] waves AND WHATEVER, BUT STAYING IN THE
[1:32:09] SECURITY of this word. Stay in the
[1:32:12] church.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the building.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT STAY IN THE CHURCH. STAY IN
[1:32:17] THE BRIDE. STAY IN THE WORD BECAUSE
[1:32:19] THERE'S OUR ETERNAL SECURITY. THERE'S
[1:32:21] WHERE OUR LIFE IS.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; People try to live so close to the world
[1:32:28] to justify. Amen. WE OUGHT TO BE TRYING
[1:32:30] TO GET AS FAR AWAY FROM THE WORLD AS WE
[1:32:32] CAN.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I seen a a a a statement a man uh
[1:32:37] posted on on the on the social media the
[1:32:40] other day. He said, "I wonder how many
[1:32:42] teaspoons of the devil's sugar, Amen,
[1:32:44] can we take, Amen, and still claim to be
[1:32:47] a a believer?
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; How many teaspoons of the devil's sugar
[1:32:51] can we keep taking, Amen, and still
[1:32:53] PROFESS TO BE A BELIEVER?
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; We don't want to mar our testimony,
[1:32:58] church."
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a time, amen, a season for
[1:33:03] all things. There's a time to be
[1:33:06] manifested. Amen. And you're living in
[1:33:08] that time, a final voice for a final
[1:33:10] hour. Amen. A people that's been called
[1:33:13] AND CHOSEN, AMEN, BY GOD. NOT NOT when
[1:33:16] you nailed in the altar 10, 15 years ago
[1:33:19] or or or 10 or 15 days ago, BUT BEFORE
[1:33:22] THE FOUNDATION of the world, God chose
[1:33:24] you. Amen. And when he chose you, he
[1:33:26] made you what YOU ARE. YOU COULD NEVER
[1:33:28] HAVE BEEN A LUTHERAN. You could have
[1:33:30] never been a Methodist. You could never
[1:33:31] HAVE BEEN A PENTECOSTAL. SO, WELL, I
[1:33:33] CAME THROUGH THAT. THAT'S RIGHT. YOU
[1:33:34] CAME through it, but you didn't LIVE
[1:33:36] THERE. THAT WAS NOT WHAT YOU WERE
[1:33:38] DESTINED TO BE. YOU WERE DESTINED TO BE
[1:33:40] A BRIDE. WHY WERE YOU DESTINED TO BE A
[1:33:42] BRIDE? FOR THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD,
[1:33:44] GOD SAW IN YOU WHAT IT WOULD take to
[1:33:46] believe this message.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; What the the the character, Amen. The
[1:33:50] trait, the the faith, AS BROTHER SHELLEY
[1:33:53] SAID EARLIER, THE FAITH to believe this
[1:33:55] word. You can't believe it without faith
[1:33:57] in God.
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; And you were chosen people. You were YOU
[1:34:02] WERE AN ORDAINED PEOPLE. AMEN. BEFORE
[1:34:05] GOD EVEN BEFORE YOU EVER GOT HERE.
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; That's what you were. Amen. There's a
[1:34:10] time for it. Amen. Not in Luther's day
[1:34:13] or Wesley, as I said, OR ANY OF THOSE
[1:34:15] OTHER DAYS. YOU were chosen to be the
[1:34:18] bride of Christ for this hour.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Not the church, but the bride of
[1:34:22] Christ. Amen. You know, when a bride
[1:34:24] becomes a bride, she becomes a bride on
[1:34:26] her wedding day.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been a fiance, it's time to
[1:34:30] be the bride.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. We've been a fiance long enough.
[1:34:34] time to be the bride. Amen. You know,
[1:34:37] and and you probably I I heard a story
[1:34:39] about this couple that was getting
[1:34:41] married and and the and the girl, she
[1:34:43] was kind of getting a little wet. Uh her
[1:34:46] feet was getting a little wet and she's
[1:34:48] getting A LITTLE ANXIOUS AND she was
[1:34:49] having doubts about her her her husband
[1:34:53] to be. And she went to him and she said,
[1:34:54] "I I I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WANT to marry
[1:34:56] me. You know my life. You know the
[1:34:59] MISTAKES I'VE MADE. I HAVEN'T BEEN GOOD
[1:35:01] ALL MY LIFE. I'VE I'VE MADE SOME BAD
[1:35:04] MISTAKES. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY YOU WANT
[1:35:06] TO MARRY ME. And he looks at her,
[1:35:09] brother Gillian, and says, "Because I
[1:35:10] love you." Amen. And when we go to him
[1:35:13] and we say, "Lord, h how could you
[1:35:15] possibly want to marry me? How could you
[1:35:17] possibly choose me? You've seen my
[1:35:20] wrongs. You've seen my mistakes. YOU'VE
[1:35:22] SEEN THE ERRORS. YOU'VE SEEN THE SIN IN
[1:35:24] MY LIFE. HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY CHOOSE
[1:35:26] ME TO BE A BRIDE?" AND HE LOOKS AT YOU

[1:36:58] little while?

[1:37:02] a man by the name of of Owen Thornton.
[1:37:06] He was my great great greatgrandfather.
[1:37:09] He had a son by the name of Thomas. I
[1:37:12] was there,

[1:37:18] 1700s, Thomas had a son. Thomas Thornton
[1:37:22] had a son. And they called him Matthew.

[1:38:47] PERSECUTE YOU. AMEN. HE CAN RUN YOU
[1:38:49] DOWN. HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO,
[1:38:51] BUT HE CANNOT CHANGE WHO you are.

[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. I like Shelly better than now
[1:38:59] Thornton, but I can't be a Shelly.
[1:39:01] &gt;&gt; I like that name.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; But I can't be that.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because that seed, Amen. that came
[1:39:09] down through all those generations
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; was a Thornton.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; My mother was a Jenkins. My grandmother
[1:39:19] was a tailor. I was never a Jenkins.
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; I was never a tailor. They only carried
[1:39:25] me. Brother Greg, they they only carried
[1:39:28] the seed. I was never Amen. a
[1:39:30] Pentecostal. Amen. Free will a
[1:39:33] trinitarian. It only carried me. Amen.
[1:39:36] But there came a time for the birth to
[1:39:38] come forth. It came a time when I heard
[1:39:40] that word. Amen. And said, "Now is the
[1:39:43] time to be manifested. Now is the time
[1:39:46] to come forth." Come on.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; I was like I was like that little duck.
[1:39:50] Amen. That they found his egg and they
[1:39:52] put it under the chicken and the chicken
[1:39:54] hatched that duck AND HE WAS THE
[1:39:56] funniest looking thing. His beak was ALL
[1:39:58] FLAT AND WHATEVER. HE HAD WEB feet and
[1:40:00] he was the funniest looking thing. He
[1:40:01] just didn't fit.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; You ever felt like he didn't fit?
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Good. Amen. Because you don't you don't
[1:40:08] belong to this world. You don't belong
[1:40:10] to this world. YOU DON'T BELONG TO THE
[1:40:13] IDEAS AND OPINIONS OF THIS WORLD. But
[1:40:16] one DAY THAT MOTHER KEN MADE A MISTAKE.
[1:40:18] SHE DRESSED him up. She put a little
[1:40:19] chicken comb on his head. She put little
[1:40:21] chicken feet on his on his on on his web

[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. If he could have kept you away
[1:40:40] from it, if he could keep fellowship
[1:40:41] away from God. Amen. All right. But see,
[1:40:45] you he can't do that because you were
[1:40:47] born for this. Amen. This was your day.
[1:40:50] Amen. This was your hour. THIS WAS YOUR
[1:40:52] DESTINY. AMEN. And that old mother KEN
[1:40:54] MADE A MISTAKE OF WALKING that little
[1:40:56] chicks in that duck down by the river.
[1:40:58] And all of a sudden, he got a sniff of
[1:41:00] that water. He started sniffing.
[1:41:04] Something smells different. Something
[1:41:06] different about THIS MESSAGE. SOMETHING
[1:41:08] DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS WORD THAN WHAT I'VE
[1:41:10] been hearing. SOMEBODY SAY, "AMEN." AND
[1:41:12] DID IT MAKE A DIFFERENT SOUND? AMEN. THE
[1:41:14] TRUMPET when it sounds, IF IT'S SOUNDING
[1:41:16] THE WRONG THING, it'll never it'll never
[1:41:18] represent the king. BUT WHEN IT STARTS
[1:41:20] SOUNDING THE RIGHT SOUND, that little
[1:41:22] duck got a whiff of that water and the
[1:41:24] closer he got to the water, the better
[1:41:26] better it smelled. All of a sudden, THE
[1:41:28] CHICKEN HEAD CAME OFF. AMEN. The web
[1:41:30] feeth were manifested. He took OFF THE
[1:41:33] CHICKEN FEET AND HE HEADED FOR THE water
[1:41:36] and he ran just as hard as he could run.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you heard this message, amen,
[1:41:41] joy came in your heart. I know it did as
[1:41:44] it did mine and you just I can't wait to
[1:41:47] get to it. I can't hear it enough. I
[1:41:49] can't wait to get to church. Brother
[1:41:51] Shelley, don't you want to start having
[1:41:52] service maybe four or five nights a
[1:41:54] week? Amen. We just need to hear it. We
[1:41:57] want to HEAR IT. WE DESIRE TO HEAR IT.
[1:41:59] THAT'S THE WORD. WHY? BECAUSE THERE'S
[1:42:00] something on the inside of us, pulling,
[1:42:03] amen, working toward the outside.
[1:42:04] THERE'S SOMETHING PULLING US, AMEN, BACK
[1:42:07] TO THIS WORD. IT'S PULLING US. IT'S

[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; It was not in my choosing.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN THE
[1:42:33] FIRST Thornton came along. The word
[1:42:35] Thornton is Anglo-Saxon. And you forgive
[1:42:37] me for this. I hope it it emphasizes
[1:42:40] something. But the name Thornton uh is
[1:42:42] Anglo-Saxon. It comes from England. And
[1:42:44] the word t o n ton meant a heel like a a
[1:42:49] rise. And and thorn of course you know
[1:42:51] what that mean. So if the person's name
[1:42:54] happened to be Tom, they would refer to
[1:42:56] him as Tom from the hill of thorns over
[1:42:59] there. Amen. That's how it came about.
[1:43:01] So he it became John Thorn Hill. Jump
[1:43:04] John from the uh Thornhill. Amen.
[1:43:11] Now they call me Jesus.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; They call me little miss Jesus. Amen. I
[1:43:16] had a name change. Somebody said,
[1:43:18] "What's in a name?" I tell you a whole
[1:43:20] lot. Amen. There's a whole lot in a
[1:43:22] name. Amen. Because I was part of it.
[1:43:25] Amen. I was I was there. Amen. All the
[1:43:28] way back. And And I don't I don't know
[1:43:29] when the first Thornton Amen. set their
[1:43:32] name on something. You can go back. I
[1:43:33] went back a lot in history and and
[1:43:35] ancestor and chased a lot of things and
[1:43:37] traced a lot of things. Amen. A lot of
[1:43:39] famous thorntons and whatever. But the
[1:43:41] name, Amen, that seed that came down
[1:43:45] through every generation made me what I
[1:43:47] am today.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Some I'm I gain weight, I lose weight.

[1:43:59] Amen. We get We're young and we get old.
[1:44:03] All those change, but there's one thing
[1:44:05] that has never changed. I've been a
[1:44:07] Thornton all my life.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. From the very moment, Amen. that
[1:44:11] that doctor held me up. Amen. Like that.
[1:44:14] And popped me. And that first
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; breath came out. Amen. I've been a
[1:44:20] Thornton. And ever since God, Amen. Slap
[1:44:23] me real hard spiritually speaking. Amen.
[1:44:25] And put the breath of life in you and
[1:44:27] me. Amen. We have become sons and
[1:44:29] daughters of God. And there ain't
[1:44:31] nothing nobody can do about it.
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; And I can boast of that. And you can
[1:44:35] boast of that. Amen. You can you can put
[1:44:38] your fingers in your lapels and you can
[1:44:40] poke YOUR CHEST OUT AND YOU CAN SAY,
[1:44:41] "DEVIL, I AM WHO I am. BY THE GRACE OF
[1:44:44] GOD, NOT BY MYSELF, NOT BY MY STRENGTH,
[1:44:48] NOT BY MY ABILITY, NOT BY my doing, but
[1:44:50] by the grace of God. I am his son
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; because I was destined to be that way."
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:45:05] trinitarian church and Amen. I was

[1:45:09] over the chairs every night and people
[1:45:11] get speaking in tongues and running and
[1:45:13] go home and say, "Well, the preacher
[1:45:14] didn't even get to preach because the
[1:45:16] Holy Ghost took over." Oh, such error.
[1:45:18] God forgive me for ever being part of
[1:45:19] that. Amen. But that's the way we were.
[1:45:22] Amen. But it was just another stage.
[1:45:24] See, it was just another stage. I I I
[1:45:27] didn't I didn't get to where I am right
[1:45:30] now overnight. It's taken me It's taken
[1:45:32] me 83 years to get to where I am right
[1:45:34] now. And I've been through a whole lot
[1:45:36] of different stages, sister, all through
[1:45:38] those 83 years. Amen. And I didn't get
[1:45:41] where I am in the word. You didn't get
[1:45:43] where you are in the word. Amen.
[1:45:44] Overnight. It took a maturity. It took a
[1:45:47] growing. Amen. It took It took the
[1:45:49] knowledge of the word of God. It took
[1:45:51] preaching from your pastor. Amen. And
[1:45:53] other ministers of God to get you where
[1:45:55] you are today.
[1:45:57] Amen.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; But it was only refining it. It was only
[1:46:01] refining it.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; But I was never born to be anything
[1:46:06] except a bl a bride believer. Well,
[1:46:09] brother Johnny, don't you think you can
[1:46:10] fall? I could fall tomorrow.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; But that's not what I'm looking for.
[1:46:16] That's my not my destiny. Have I made
[1:46:19] mistakes, Lord, more than I want to
[1:46:20] admit? Amen. And have I come short of
[1:46:23] the glory of God more than I can than I
[1:46:25] can ever imagine. Amen. But you know,
[1:46:28] I'm I'm a I'm a builder. I build things

[1:46:48] all those generations, Amen.
[1:46:50] was manifested through him. Amen. And
[1:46:53] there he is. That's the only thing I've
[1:46:55] created. Brother Bram said, "The reason
[1:46:56] people you like to be around people of
[1:46:58] of like precious faith is because you're
[1:47:00] a mini creator. You create an
[1:47:02] atmosphere.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; You create an atmosphere." You know,
[1:47:05] we've we've heard him say that within
[1:47:07] the bride of Christ lies the ability to
[1:47:08] create worlds and go there and have
[1:47:10] them. EVERYBODY'S WANTING TO GET OUT OF
[1:47:12] out of out of Fort Smith and Dur want to
[1:47:14] go live in another uh another place.
[1:47:17] Let's just create this atmosphere of
[1:47:18] worship. If we can create an atmosphere
[1:47:21] of worship around us, we have
[1:47:23] accomplished, Amen. what the prophet
[1:47:24] meant for us to accomplish. I believe.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. If we can create that atmosphere
[1:47:29] of worship. Amen.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know that there's any thorn
[1:47:34] cheer. But I'm sorry, you can't be one.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; You can't be one.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you didn't have my father.
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; You didn't have my father. But I can't
[1:47:46] be a Shelly cuz I didn't have his
[1:47:48] father. Amen. You say, "Well, brother
[1:47:50] John, that means there's a whole
[1:47:51] different one." Amen. But see, we all
[1:47:53] come from the same family. We all come
[1:47:55] into the same family. Amen. We were all
[1:47:57] part of God. We'll all be part of him.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the way it I I just I just
[1:48:03] He chose me. I didn't cho choose him. I
[1:48:07] wasn't looking for him. He came looking
[1:48:08] for me.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many believe that you were?
[1:48:11] You were lost. You You know when when
[1:48:13] when when God God came in the cool of
[1:48:16] the day, Amen. looking for Adam and Eve.
[1:48:19] Amen. And he said, "Adam, where are
[1:48:20] you?"
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; Do you think for one moment God didn't
[1:48:23] know where Adam was?
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; He knew exactly where he was.
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And let me tell you something. God
[1:48:28] knew exactly where you were.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. But thank God in the evening time,
[1:48:32] in the cool of the day, he's come and
[1:48:34] he's called. Amen. Not just Jodo. He's
[1:48:38] called your name.

[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; And when he calls that bride, Amen.
[1:48:45] Who's Who's going to answer? Only the
[1:48:47] bride. Only the bride that knows her
[1:48:50] name. Amen.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; You I could Brother Ben sitting back. I
[1:48:54] could say, "Hey, you
[1:48:56] come up here." He wouldn't know who I'm
[1:48:59] talking about. I could be talking about
[1:49:00] any of these brothers. But I say,

[1:49:13] our opinions. Amen. But I have been
[1:49:15] identified by that seed word. And that
[1:49:18] seed is a continuation of life
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; for years. I told brother Shelley today,
[1:49:22] Carol and I were married for about 10
[1:49:24] years before Adam was born. We were
[1:49:26] beginning to think we weren't going to
[1:49:28] have any children. I would be the last
[1:49:30] 40. There'd be no more of us. Amen. And
[1:49:33] then the Lord blessed us. Well, I've got
[1:49:34] a grandson now, and if the Lord terries
[1:49:36] long enough, if if he comes before he's
[1:49:39] old enough to marry and and have a
[1:49:41] family, he'll be the last one. Amen.
[1:49:45] And here you sit. You are the final
[1:49:48] voice.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; You are the final bride. There won't be
[1:49:52] any other church age after you.
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. There won't be any other message.
[1:49:56] There won't be any other messenger.
[1:49:58] Amen. You are the final thing. Amen. You
[1:50:01] are the You are the consummation. You
[1:50:04] are the absolute of God's work from the
[1:50:07] beginning of the world. Amen. You are
[1:50:09] the consmation. Listen. Amen. Luther's
[1:50:12] message was good. Amen. Justification is
[1:50:15] wonderful. Wesley's message was
[1:50:16] wonderful. Amen. But let me tell you
[1:50:19] something. It wasn't complete. Amen.
[1:50:20] Wesley wasn't complete. The Pentecostal
[1:50:23] movement wasn't complete. But in you is
[1:50:25] the complete the the the complete plan,
[1:50:29] the complete work of God in this hour.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that with all my heart.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And listen, if if you're if you're
[1:50:39] struggling today, and I know we
[1:50:41] struggle, if something's holding you
[1:50:43] back, Amen. All you have to do is just
[1:50:45] turn loose and let God have his way.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Just turn loose and let the Lord have
[1:50:49] his way. If there's something holding
[1:50:50] you down, Amen. And I can't imagine with
[1:50:53] the ministry that you have here, I can't
[1:50:55] imagine any of you having any problems.
[1:50:57] You ought to be on the mountaintops.
[1:51:01] I heard a story one time how the a king
[1:51:04] somebody gave him a couple of baby
[1:51:06] eagles
[1:51:07] and he created this aviary for him and
[1:51:09] he hired the best trainer and he got the
[1:51:12] best food and amen all this and the the
[1:51:16] eagles grew and he go out and one of the
[1:51:19] eagles would be soaring all over the sky
[1:51:21] just circling around and the other eagle
[1:51:24] was sitting on the perch
[1:51:27] and they changed his food. They got a
[1:51:30] different teacher to teach him all this
[1:51:31] stuff about hunting and whatever. They
[1:51:34] go out the next morning. He was sitting
[1:51:35] on the perch.
[1:51:37] &gt;&gt; And the king said, "I'll give hundreds
[1:51:40] of of dollars of gold to any man that
[1:51:44] can teach this eagle to fly."
[1:51:48] So he went out the next morning and both
[1:51:51] eagles were flying around.
[1:51:54] And the king said, "Wonderful,
[1:51:56] wonderful. who do who done all of this?
[1:51:59] And an old farmer with ragged bib
[1:52:01] overalls, long beard, hair all matted,
[1:52:05] and they want stepped forward and said,
[1:52:07] "How could you have possibly done all of
[1:52:09] this? What did you do to get this eagle
[1:52:13] to fly?" He said, "I cut off the limb
[1:52:16] that he was sitting on."
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; See, cut off what's holding you back.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. If something's holding you back,
[1:52:24] if you haven't got THE VICTORY TODAY,
[1:52:26] CUT IT OFF.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; GET rid of it. Amen. It's not worth it,
[1:52:30] church. It's not worth missing OUT WITH
[1:52:32] GOD. IT'S NOT WORTH HAVING NOT HAVING
[1:52:34] THE BLESSINGS OF GOD. CUT IT OFF
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; AND START FLYING.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; YOU WERE BORN TO FLY, CHURCH. YOU
[1:52:41] WEREN'T BORN FOR THE MUD HOLE IN THE MUD
[1:52:43] PIT. YOU WERE BORN TO FLY.
[1:52:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:52:48] That's a fact for just It's just a fact.
[1:52:51] Amen. You didn't choose to be this way.
[1:52:54] You didn't choose to be anything. BUT
[1:52:56] GOD ORDAINED YOU. AMEN. WHY DID HE do
[1:52:58] that? Why did God pick you? Why did he
[1:53:01] pick me? Amen.
[1:53:04] He saw all the mistakes I'd make.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; If there had been one person lost, he
[1:53:09] would have still died for that one
[1:53:11] person.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw all the mistakes and all
[1:53:14] the shortcomings.
[1:53:16] But he looked back into that book. Amen.
[1:53:19] and he saw that first opportunity to
[1:53:22] hear the word of the Lord. Amen.
[1:53:27] I wished I could have got a hold of one
[1:53:29] of the little young people here before
[1:53:32] service, but I preached this message
[1:53:34] once in at home and I called my grandson
[1:53:38] up and I said, "John Luke, if I offered
[1:53:41] you a dollar or a nickel, which one
[1:53:45] would you take?" He said, "I'd take the
[1:53:47] dollar." So I wrote his name on that
[1:53:50] dollar bill and put it in my pocket.
[1:53:54] So during the service I said, "John
[1:53:56] Luke, come up here." And he came up. I
[1:54:00] said, "If I offered you a dollar or a
[1:54:02] nickel, which one would you take?" He
[1:54:04] said, "The dollar."
[1:54:06] And I pulled the dollar out and I said,
[1:54:07] "Whose name is written on that dollar
[1:54:09] bill?" He said, "Mine, John Luke
[1:54:11] Thornton." Amen. See, I knew he was
[1:54:13] going to take that dollar. Why? because
[1:54:15] I gave him the opportunity before he
[1:54:17] ever got there. God knew. God knew what
[1:54:20] you were going to do before you got
[1:54:21] here. So, he wrote your name on THAT
[1:54:23] DOLLAR BILL BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE
[1:54:25] WORLD.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; HOW CAN I BE SURE OF IT TODAY, CHURCH?
[1:54:29] LOOK IN THE WORD OF GOD. FIND YOURSELF
[1:54:31] in this book. AMEN. THE LORD IS MY
[1:54:34] SHEPHERD. AMEN. GOD DID THIS FOR ME. I'M
[1:54:37] IN THE BOOK.
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN. The pages of this book were
[1:54:40] written about me.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. It's all how we respond to
[1:54:44] it. It's how we react to the word of
[1:54:46] God. Amen. You know, when the angel
[1:54:48] Gabriel came to Mary, Amen. The first
[1:54:51] thing he done was let her know who she
[1:54:52] was. Blessed art thou among women. Amen.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Said you're going to have a child. How
[1:54:58] can that possibly be? Nothing wrong with
[1:55:00] asking God why. Amen. To ask why is to
[1:55:03] have understanding.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. How can this be? He said, the Holy
[1:55:07] Ghost that will overshadow you and that
[1:55:09] that is conceived in you will be of God.
[1:55:12] Amen.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; You know what Mo what Mary's response
[1:55:15] was?
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; I don't know about that. It ain't never
[1:55:19] happened before. No, sir.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; No, that wasn't her response.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; This was something that had never
[1:55:24] happened before.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; You're sitting here today as a bride
[1:55:27] that has never happened before. What's
[1:55:29] your response to that word? Amen. She
[1:55:32] said, "Let it be according to thy word."
[1:55:35] Amen. Let it be according to what?
[1:55:37] Sometime, you know, the word sounds
[1:55:38] hard. How how can these things be? Jesus
[1:55:40] told the disciples one time he said
[1:55:42] except you eat my flesh and drink my
[1:55:44] blood you have no part with me well the
[1:55:46] disciples having followed him said Lord
[1:55:49] this is a this is a a hard saying who
[1:55:51] can do it Jesus response was you also go
[1:55:55] away I love the response to Peter who
[1:55:57] can we go you alone have the words of
[1:55:59] eternal life
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; where am I going where am I going to go
[1:56:02] without this message where am I going to
[1:56:04] go without the word of God I have no
[1:56:06] hope I have no security I have no I have
[1:56:09] no chance of making outside of the bride
[1:56:11] of being a bride of Christ.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; We're we we fall, we fail, we come short
[1:56:19] a lot of times. Amen.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:23] &gt;&gt; But my faults don't define who I am. My
[1:56:26] fail MY FAILURES DON'T DEFINE WHO I AM.
[1:56:29] I'm not defined by that. I'm defined by
[1:56:31] the word of God. I'm defined by what God
[1:56:34] said about me. Amen. I'll have faults
[1:56:37] and failures as long as I live until
[1:56:39] Lord raptures the church or takes me
[1:56:41] home.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:42] &gt;&gt; But I'm not defined by that.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Now, people may try to define you. They
[1:56:48] may put you in a pigeon hole. A lot of
[1:56:50] times they'll do that.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; But God does not define you by your
[1:56:53] faults or your failures.
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're defined by your reaction to
[1:56:58] the word of God. You're defined by by
[1:57:01] what how you respond to the word of God.
[1:57:03] And your response is determined because
[1:57:06] of who you were.
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; Where you came from. Amen. And where
[1:57:11] you're going when you leave here.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; I I think about Abraham a lot of times.
[1:57:18] Amen. Abraham gives us a whole lot of
[1:57:20] good lessons.
[1:57:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:24] He was down there in the valley of
[1:57:26] Chaes.
[1:57:28] I don't remember reading in the
[1:57:30] scripture where Abraham was looking for
[1:57:33] a way to get out.
[1:57:36] I don't see any scripture that says he
[1:57:38] was saying, "Boy, I wish I could leave
[1:57:39] this place." I don't find anything which
[1:57:41] he was saying, you know, there's got to
[1:57:43] be something better than this. I don't
[1:57:44] find any scripture where he was he was
[1:57:47] uh uh tired of doing what he was doing.
[1:57:49] He was happy.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; He was doing what he was doing. He was
[1:57:52] making idols and sudden making a good
[1:57:53] living. Everything was going fine. But
[1:57:57] God had other plans.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometime God will come and he'll
[1:58:01] interrupt your plans. You know, when I
[1:58:02] was growing up, I had a lot of I had a
[1:58:04] lot of plans. I Boy, I'd have laid them
[1:58:07] out. I'm going to do this and I'm going
[1:58:09] to do that. Guess what? God just came
[1:58:11] and messed up everything.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; That's all I can say. God just came. He
[1:58:15] messed up all my plans. Amen.
[1:58:19] &gt;&gt; But, Brother Angel, I look back and I
[1:58:20] say, "Thank God.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the mess. Thank God for
[1:58:24] messing me up." But there was Abraham
[1:58:26] down there and and and all of a sudden
[1:58:28] God decided he would elect Abraham,
[1:58:31] Amen, as the father of faith. And he
[1:58:33] went down and Abraham get up and leave
[1:58:35] his family. And you know the story. I
[1:58:37] don't have to go through all of it.
[1:58:38] Amen. But Abraham became a very wealthy
[1:58:41] man. Amen.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; And as as he was getting older, Amen. he
[1:58:46] decided that it was time for his son to
[1:58:48] have a bride.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; It's time for God's son to have a bride.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:57] &gt;&gt; And Abraham called his servant Eleazar.
[1:58:59] Amen. And he gave him a journal with
[1:59:01] everything that he a list of everything
[1:59:03] that he owned. All of his cattle, his
[1:59:05] gold, his silver, his his his sheep, his
[1:59:07] oxen, everything that he had. He said,
[1:59:09] "I want you to go, Amen. back to my
[1:59:13] kindred."
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. And get a bride for my son.
[1:59:19] God will only marry
[1:59:23] himself.
[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; He will only marry his bride.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Eleazar went back and and and
[1:59:30] bear with me just a moment. Eleazar went
[1:59:33] back, Amen. to that land. Amen. And he
[1:59:36] and he laid out this fleece before the
[1:59:38] Lord. I love the fact that he camped
[1:59:40] outside of the city and he camped by the
[1:59:43] well.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. You don't need to be you don't God
[1:59:46] doesn't want his people mingled in with
[1:59:48] with the world. He had them on the
[1:59:50] outside the city. Amen. By the well
[1:59:52] because listen, he knew that that's
[1:59:55] where the virgins that's where the young
[1:59:56] women would always come to draw water.
[1:59:59] Isn't it amazing that the bride always
[2:00:01] wants to go to the well? She always
[2:00:03] wants to go where the water is. Amen.
[2:00:06] Because that water of life is the only
[2:00:07] thing that will will cleanse us. Amen.
[2:00:10] Will sustain us. Amen. and make us what
[2:00:12] we need to be.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; And he camped out there and all of a
[2:00:16] sudden here come all these young ladies
[2:00:18] and and Eleazar had laid out this
[2:00:20] vision. Let the woman that says so and
[2:00:24] so, let her be the one. Amen.
[2:00:29] She came out and the conversation went
[2:00:31] on and she said exactly
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; what the word was.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; That's it. She said the right thing. She
[2:00:41] had the right response.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and she said, "Come on, go to
[2:00:46] the house. We'll fix supper for you."
[2:00:48] Amen. Feed your cattle and and and all
[2:00:50] this stuff. So they went to the father's
[2:00:52] house. Amen. And and and and Leven, I
[2:00:55] believe it was, decided he wanted to
[2:00:56] know all the story. And and Eleazar
[2:00:59] said, "Before anything, I got to tell
[2:01:01] you why I'm here. I'm here to get a
[2:01:04] bride.
[2:01:06] I'm here to get a bride for my master's
[2:01:09] son."
[2:01:10] Amen. And he went through all of it
[2:01:12] &gt;&gt; and he said, "Is she going to go?" And
[2:01:14] these are the words that I that I love.
[2:01:17] Then the father said, "It's not for me
[2:01:19] to say.
[2:01:20] &gt;&gt; It's her decision."
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; See, it it's not what the world says.
[2:01:23] It's not what your family thinks about
[2:01:25] you. The decision with her and they
[2:01:27] said, "Will you go with this man?"
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. You remember that night God said,
[2:01:32] "Will you will you go with me?" And she
[2:01:34] said, "I'll go." Amen. I'll go. and they
[2:01:38] packed up the camels and everything and
[2:01:40] she went and the story ends up with her
[2:01:42] seeing uh Isaac walking through the
[2:01:44] field. She fell in love with him
[2:01:45] immediately. He fell in love with her.
[2:01:47] She lighted off the camel, run across
[2:01:49] the field and he grabbed up and kissed
[2:01:50] her. Isn't that a beautiful love story?
[2:01:53] Amen. It's not any more beautiful than
[2:01:56] your love story right here tonight.
[2:01:58] Because God sent a servant. God sent a
[2:02:01] word. Amen. To get a bride for his son.
[2:02:04] Look around at your neighbor today.
[2:02:06] Amen. and see God manifested in flesh.
[2:02:09] See that bride sitting beside of you.
[2:02:11] Know for a fact, amen, that you're all
[2:02:14] part of that bride of Christ.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; God elected Abraham. Amen. He elected
[2:02:21] you and I.
[2:02:22] &gt;&gt; No man cometh to the father. The
[2:02:24] scripture said except cometh to me
[2:02:26] except the father draw him.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham said this. He
[2:02:30] said ponder on this. He said when when
[2:02:32] divine love is projected, Amen. It comes
[2:02:36] to its destiny and grace takes over.
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. It comes to its destiny. WHAT IT
[2:02:42] WAS DESTINED FOR. WHAT WAS that love of
[2:02:44] God for? He loved us. Amen. So that we
[2:02:47] could love him.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT IN OUR CONTROL. IT'S NOT IN OUR
[2:02:52] ABILITY. AMEN. It's in God's control.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IT'S IT'S UP TO GOD. IT'S WHAT GOD
[2:02:57] HAS SAID IN HIS WORD.
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:03:02] How can it possibly be? How can how can
[2:03:04] we how can we profess to be the bride of
[2:03:07] Christ? Look at us in the word of God.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Open up and find your picture on
[2:03:11] every page of the book.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; But you know sometime when we begin to
[2:03:16] think of everything in the first person
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; and I said it's not in my ability. It's
[2:03:21] not in my my control. It's not what I
[2:03:23] can do. It's not what you can do. when
[2:03:25] we when we be when we began to say I can
[2:03:28] do this. I can do that. I have done
[2:03:32] this. I didn't bring me to where I am
[2:03:34] today. You didn't bring yourself to
[2:03:36] where you are today. But when we begin
[2:03:38] to deal with oursel in the and our our
[2:03:40] relationship and our experience, when we
[2:03:42] begin to deal with it in the first
[2:03:44] person, we leave God out of the picture
[2:03:46] completely. And you know that the only
[2:03:48] thing that can hinder and stop the work
[2:03:50] of God is your free will.
[2:03:55] The only thing that can stop God from
[2:03:57] working is your free will.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. I remember our
[2:04:02] precious brother Perry, we mentioned it
[2:04:04] day at lunch. Amen. Told me one time,
[2:04:06] brother Johnny, always keep your balance
[2:04:08] in the scripture. Amen. And you know
[2:04:10] what else he said? He said, "The fact
[2:04:12] that we're here, I remember one of the
[2:04:14] services. The fact that we're here, the
[2:04:15] fact that you're here tonight, not in
[2:04:17] new hope, but in your in this place in
[2:04:20] our walk with God is concrete evidence
[2:04:22] that we're going to make it the rest of
[2:04:24] the way.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; He didn't bring us this far to leave
[2:04:27] us."
[2:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. But but when we put ourselves as I
[2:04:30] can do this and I've done that and I can
[2:04:31] do this and we leave Christ completely
[2:04:33] out of the picture and it won't work
[2:04:35] that way, church.
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:38] Some of you probably have seen it, but
[2:04:40] there was a man put up an illustration
[2:04:41] on on social media, Alistister Big. And
[2:04:44] he said, "What about the man on the
[2:04:46] cross, the thief on the cross?" He said,
[2:04:47] "I can't wait to get to heaven to ask
[2:04:50] this guy, how did that work out for you?
[2:04:52] One minute you're cursing God, one
[2:04:54] minute you're condemned to death. Amen.
[2:04:56] And the next minute you're standing HERE
[2:04:57] IN HEAVEN, HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?"
[2:05:00] And the thief says, "I don't know. What
[2:05:03] do you mean you don't know?" And the
[2:05:05] angel came to him and said said, "What
[2:05:07] are you doing here?" He said, 'I don't
[2:05:08] know. What do you mean you don't know? I
[2:05:11] How did you get here? I don't know.
[2:05:13] Well, let me go get the supervisor
[2:05:15] angel. And he comes over and he says, "A
[2:05:17] question for you. What is your stand on
[2:05:20] justification?" I don't know anything
[2:05:21] about it. Well, what about the
[2:05:23] scripture? He said, "I don't know
[2:05:24] anything about it." "Well, how did you
[2:05:26] get here?" He said, "The only thing I
[2:05:29] know is that the man on the middle cross
[2:05:33] said I could come. Amen.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[2:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's all because of him, church.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; It's It's not me. He said the right
[2:05:41] thing. Amen. The man on the middle cross
[2:05:44] said that I could come. Amen. And let me
[2:05:47] tell you something. JESUS HAS SAID you
[2:05:49] can come. Amen. Jesus has said, "You are
[2:05:52] part of me.
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; You're part OF ME. YOU'RE PART OF MY
[2:05:55] FAMILY."
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; I love it. Don't you, church?
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. If the devil can if the devil can
[2:06:02] get us into a singular mind, singular
[2:06:05] point of mind that where it's all about
[2:06:07] us, then we're going to lose we're going
[2:06:08] to lose ground with God. Amen. There's
[2:06:11] nothing that will interrupt the program
[2:06:13] of God. Amen. We're bound to arrive.
[2:06:16] There's nothing going to stop it. The
[2:06:17] devil can come and he can he can he can
[2:06:19] disrupt our fellowship, but he can never
[2:06:22] disrupt the plan of God. Amen. That
[2:06:25] election looks back. Amen. It looks back
[2:06:27] in when I was a sinner. When I was a
[2:06:29] cuckerberg. Amen. Now I'm a wheat. When
[2:06:31] I was a sinner, now I'm a believer.
[2:06:33] Amen. Not just a believer, but a bride
[2:06:35] believer.
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:39] Isaiah the prophet prophesied 750
[2:06:43] years before that word came to Mary.
[2:06:47] Amen. 750 years that word
[2:06:50] circled the globe waiting. Amen. For the
[2:06:55] right vessel.
[2:06:56] Wait, waiting for the right vessel for
[2:06:59] seven ages of the church. Amen. For all
[2:07:02] the seven dispensation of time all the
[2:07:05] way from eternity past. That that word,
[2:07:08] amen, has been circling the earth. Amen.
[2:07:11] Waiting for that very moment to drop
[2:07:13] into hearts of a people that would say,
[2:07:15] "Let it be so according to your word."
[2:07:18] Amen. All that time that word has been
[2:07:20] circling. But let me tell you something.
[2:07:22] It has found a lodging place. Amen. has
[2:07:26] found a lodging place.
[2:07:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. In you and I.
[2:07:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:07:33] &gt;&gt; He said the right thing.
[2:07:35] &gt;&gt; She said the right thing.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; You said the right thing. Amen. Seven
[2:07:40] ages. Luther justification. Wesley.
[2:07:43] Amen. But God has carved out a bride in
[2:07:46] this hour.
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's chipped away everything. One
[2:07:49] of my one of my favorite characters in
[2:07:51] history is Michelangelo. And everybody
[2:07:53] knows him for the statue of Moses. Amen.
[2:07:56] And I'm I'm I'm sure that the the the
[2:07:58] the Pope did not know that when he
[2:08:01] commissioned Michelangelo to sculpture
[2:08:03] the mo the statue of Moses that it was
[2:08:06] going to become a masterpiece of of
[2:08:07] messages for the bride of Christ.
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the story is told that one
[2:08:12] day, Amen. Michelangelo Angelo was out
[2:08:16] in his yard and he was walking around
[2:08:17] and around and around this great big old
[2:08:20] chunk of marble and you're looking at
[2:08:23] he'd walk around and he look at it and
[2:08:24] he walk around and a friend of us come
[2:08:26] up and SAID, "MICKEY, WHAT ARE YOU
[2:08:28] DOING?" He said, "What do you see
[2:08:31] there?" He said, "Are you kidding? I see
[2:08:35] a big old chunk of marble." And
[2:08:37] Michelangelo look looked at him and
[2:08:39] said, "No." He said, "There's an angel
[2:08:41] in there and he's trying to get out and
[2:08:44] it's my job to get him out." And he
[2:08:47] started tripping away at all the marble.
[2:08:49] Amen. And all this to make that angel,
[2:08:52] amen, God's been working on us, amen,
[2:08:54] for seven, seven dispensations, seven
[2:08:56] ages of this church. But let me tell
[2:08:58] you, there's a masterpiece. Amen. There
[2:09:00] is a bride today that we can step back
[2:09:03] and look at and say, "THAT IS WHAT I'M
[2:09:06] SUPPOSED to be. That is what God
[2:09:09] ordained that I be.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:13] &gt;&gt; Final voice in a final hour.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; He knew that I'd love him. Amen.
[2:09:20] Sometime you know myself personally go
[2:09:24] through this. We're up and down and up
[2:09:26] and have problems and whatever
[2:09:29] and I'll say Lord you know I love you.
[2:09:33] Things will get bad and sometime I'll
[2:09:34] say brother G. said, "Lord, have you
[2:09:36] forgot I'm down here?
[2:09:38] &gt;&gt; Do you not see what's going on?"
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's the that's the
[2:09:42] flesh. That's John talking. Do you not
[2:09:44] see what I'm going through? Why are you
[2:09:46] letting me go through? I can imagine the
[2:09:48] disciples felt that way when they were
[2:09:50] pulling on that boat and Jesus is taking
[2:09:51] a nap. Doesn't he care whether we drown
[2:09:54] or not? In fact, they went down. Lord,
[2:09:56] don't you care where we drowned? How
[2:09:58] many times have you said that? Lord, do
[2:10:00] you not see what I'm going through down
[2:10:02] here? Why are you letting me suffer all
[2:10:05] this?
[2:10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brown said, "It'll it'll
[2:10:08] make you perfect. It'll make you strong.
[2:10:10] God will test you. God will try you."
[2:10:12] Amen. To make you stronger and stronger
[2:10:15] and stronger.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because listen, church, this is
[2:10:18] no, this is no willy-w.
[2:10:21] This is no do the easiest you can and
[2:10:24] get by with whatever you can. Amen. This
[2:10:26] is total line.
[2:10:28] &gt;&gt; Before I ever knew him, before I ever
[2:10:30] loved him, he loved me. Amen. And he
[2:10:32] made a propitiation, an atonement for
[2:10:35] each and every one of us in here. Why?
[2:10:37] So that I could become from that cocker
[2:10:39] that I could become a wheat.
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. There ain't nothing good about a
[2:10:45] cocker. There wasn't that any good about
[2:10:48] me. Amen. I I started serving the Lord
[2:10:51] as brother Shelley did at a very young
[2:10:52] age. But let me tell you something. I
[2:10:54] was lost as the worst sinner on on the
[2:10:55] earth.
[2:10:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because it was it was it was it
[2:10:59] was how I got here. But it was not my
[2:11:01] destiny.
[2:11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was not my It was not what I
[2:11:04] was ordained to be.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, people tell me I
[2:11:08] shouldn't shouldn't talk about my
[2:11:10] ancestry in a bad way.
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; But, you know, not everybody in my in my
[2:11:14] ancestry
[2:11:16] were the best people.
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Some of them were some of them were, you
[2:11:19] know, whatever. My grandfather, bless
[2:11:22] his heart, Amen. I never seen him in
[2:11:25] church. Never knew him to do anything.
[2:11:27] But he loved the bottle.
[2:11:30] I'm I I hate to say it about him, but he
[2:11:32] he was he was an alcoholic. That was his
[2:11:35] life. Granny wouldn't need him let him
[2:11:37] live in the house. She put him a little
[2:11:38] house at the back. She wouldn't even let
[2:11:40] him live in the house. Amen. But every
[2:11:43] Saturday night
[2:11:46] or every Sunday morning, they'd come to
[2:11:49] my grandmother's house and knock on the
[2:11:51] door and they'd say, "Nancy, you need to
[2:11:55] come and get Mandy. He's in the creek
[2:11:57] again." cuz every Saturday night he'd
[2:12:00] get drunk and he'd fall in the creek and
[2:12:03] he fell in the creek so much that they
[2:12:05] named it after him.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; See, that's not the kind of legacy I
[2:12:08] want. That's See,
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; but thank God a chain was broken
[2:12:12] somewhere. The link The link was broken
[2:12:15] somewhere. Amen. Amen.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; All this has happened, but I'm still
[2:12:22] standing
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; and you're still standing. Why the
[2:12:25] musicians come? You know, the scripture
[2:12:26] says in in 2 Corinthians, one of my
[2:12:29] favorite scriptures,
[2:12:32] it says that God made him that was that
[2:12:36] knew no sin.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; He laid upon him all the sins.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know of Can you tell me one sin
[2:12:45] that Jesus ever committed? No, sir.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the scripture said in second
[2:12:51] Corinthians chapter 5 verse 21 I believe
[2:12:52] it is that God laid upon him every one
[2:12:56] of the sins of this world.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:13:01] &gt;&gt; And the reason he did that was so that
[2:13:04] when God looked at Jesus,
[2:13:07] he saw me.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; And when he looked at me, he saw Jesus.
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because I became him. And he he
[2:13:15] became like he became a sinner like me
[2:13:18] so that I could become God like him.
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. That that's our hope today. Amen.
[2:13:24] That's the only reason that we can boast
[2:13:26] today is that he became us so that we
[2:13:30] could become him.
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't want to ever displease
[2:13:34] him.
[2:13:36] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[2:13:38] I look back on my life and I know that
[2:13:42] at times I disappointed my dad.
[2:13:46] Amen. But I was always his son. Nothing
[2:13:49] changed that. No matter what I done, how
[2:13:52] I acted, where I went, I was always his
[2:13:55] son. So I said a a moment ago, you're
[2:13:58] not defined by your faults and your
[2:14:00] failures and your shortcomings or
[2:14:01] whatever. Because if you were born of
[2:14:03] God, if you came from God, Amen. You're
[2:14:07] always going to be God's son
[2:14:09] &gt;&gt; and there's nothing the devil can do
[2:14:10] about it. That's not an excuse to live
[2:14:12] like the world or go out and take care
[2:14:14] of. It is not a It is not a a an excuse
[2:14:17] to sin.
[2:14:19] &gt;&gt; It's a reason, Amen. to live close to
[2:14:21] God.
[2:14:22] &gt;&gt; That's what it is. Because I look back
[2:14:24] now and I I wish that I could say and I
[2:14:28] can only say in my mind, "Dad, I'm sorry
[2:14:30] I disappointed you there." And I can
[2:14:32] look back and say, "God, I'm sorry that
[2:14:34] I did this or I broke your promise or I
[2:14:37] came short, whatever." And when that and
[2:14:40] when the prophet said, "And when that
[2:14:42] love projected over projected, Amen."
[2:14:45] then destiny took over. It came to
[2:14:48] destiny and grace took over. For it's by
[2:14:51] grace that we're saved today. It's by
[2:14:53] grace, amen, that we are who we are.
[2:14:55] It's by grace that Amen. your destiny
[2:14:59] has been manifest in this last day.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's by grace and by mercy that
[2:15:04] your your destiny, who you are, the
[2:15:07] bride of Christ. And not because you
[2:15:09] chose to be that way, but because God
[2:15:11] ordained you to be that way.
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. He saw what you were, what you
[2:15:16] could be, and what you would be. Amen.
[2:15:19] He says, "I'll pick that one. I choose
[2:15:21] that one." Amen. and they'll love me and
[2:15:24] they'll come to me because God said so
[2:15:26] in his word. That's the way it would be.
[2:15:29] Amen. God bless you. Stand with me if
[2:15:31] you would. I hope that we've said
[2:15:34] something that will encourage you.
[2:15:35] &gt;&gt; Good word.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Strengthen you. Amen.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; Good word.
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; Give you give you something to to use
[2:15:42] against the devil when he comes. I am
[2:15:45] who I am and there's nothing you can do
[2:15:47] about it.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. You might not like me. You may
[2:15:50] tell just tell him. You may not like me.
[2:15:52] You like might may not like me going to
[2:15:54] New Hope and you may not like me doing
[2:15:55] this or you may not like me singing or
[2:15:57] whatever. Amen. But you can't do
[2:16:00] anything about it
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; because it's part it is it is who I am.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Could we pray?
[2:16:08] Father, thank you for your presence in
[2:16:10] your word today. Lord, I trust that you
[2:16:12] take this word and bind it up with cords
[2:16:14] of love and and let it be applied to our
[2:16:17] heart to encourage each and every one of
[2:16:18] us, Lord, that we might recognize who we
[2:16:21] are,
[2:16:22] &gt;&gt; Lord. And in recognizing who we are,
[2:16:24] cherish that that position and hold on
[2:16:27] to it, Lord, and and and be the best
[2:16:29] that we won't do anything to mar that
[2:16:32] position or the or the image of it or
[2:16:34] the privilege of it, but that we'll be
[2:16:36] those people that you're calling for in
[2:16:38] this final hour in Jesus name. Amen.
[2:16:41] Amen. I bless you.
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; He became sin
[2:16:51] who knew no sin
[2:16:54] that we might become
[2:16:58] his righteousness.
[2:17:02] He humbled himself
[2:17:05] and he carried the cross.
[2:17:09] cross.

[2:23:37] Is he your Lord tonight?
[2:23:40] If you won't let him be Lord of all,
[2:23:42] he's not Lord at all.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; We want to let him be Lord over every
[2:23:46] part of who we are.
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; Mind, will, and emotions,
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; all of us.
[2:23:53] I've been blessed tonight.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; I I do. I I've been blessed.
[2:24:01] Brother started by saying, "You won't
[2:24:02] hear anything new." Well, we didn't hear
[2:24:05] anything new, but we hear it in a
[2:24:07] different way
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; than what we might have heard it by
[2:24:10] somebody else. But I watch this message,
[2:24:13] what he was preaching tonight. I watched
[2:24:15] that very closely
[2:24:18] because there is a whole lot of
[2:24:20] hypercalvinism
[2:24:22] that has invaded this message.
[2:24:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham wasn't a
[2:24:25] hypercalvinist,
[2:24:27] but we hear a lot of hypercalvinism
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; as though we had no choice.
[2:24:33] as though he just lined us up against
[2:24:35] the wall and said, "You are, you are
[2:24:37] not. You are, you are not." It wasn't
[2:24:39] quite like that. That's primitive
[2:24:41] Baptist doctrine. And if one man got up
[2:24:44] and shot his cousin, they said he was
[2:24:47] predestinated to do it. That's
[2:24:50] hypercalvinism.
[2:24:52] But he I said, "Lord, I know he's come
[2:24:54] into a balance."
[2:24:56] And and the whole thing you lay it all
[2:24:58] out because everything he said was true,
[2:25:00] wasn't it? I believe it. But I loved it
[2:25:02] when he gave the little illustration
[2:25:04] with his grandson.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; You see you, God chose first.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; The Bible said so.
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "You've not chosen me. I've
[2:25:17] chosen you."
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; He chose first. And how could he do
[2:25:20] that? By fornowledge
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; because he knew that when I had an
[2:25:25] opportunity,
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; I would choose him.
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; That's predestination according to
[2:25:30] scripture. That's election according to
[2:25:32] scripture. And that's what you heard
[2:25:34] tonight. And it's true because he chose
[2:25:37] first.
[2:25:39] What he what he does is good and it's
[2:25:42] right and it's eternal.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; He'll get us one way or the other. He'll
[2:25:48] have his reward.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad of that? That don't
[2:25:52] upset me.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; That relaxes me.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; I want you to come and sing one more.
[2:25:58] We'll we'll go cuz we're not used to
[2:26:00] being out this early and it won't hurt
[2:26:01] us. But I I want to I want to sing the
[2:26:05] old hymn. Um I I'll get it out here in a
[2:26:09] minute. Spafford's uh wrote the hymn. It
[2:26:12] is well. I kept trying to say all is
[2:26:16] well. Same difference.
[2:26:18] But here's the man who lost a lot
[2:26:24] &gt;&gt; and uh
[2:26:26] later built the American Colony Hotel in
[2:26:31] Jerusalem.
[2:26:33] And one of the last sitdown meals that I
[2:26:36] ever had with brother Green was in the
[2:26:38] American Colony Hotel. And I told him a
[2:26:41] story that he knew about Spafford, but
[2:26:45] he didn't know that this was a a place
[2:26:47] that he built, a colony for Christians
[2:26:49] to live that's become a hotel.
[2:26:52] And they're passing over the spot where
[2:26:55] his family was lost at sea. And the
[2:27:00] captain out of respect comes to him and
[2:27:02] says, "Sir, I I thought you would want
[2:27:04] to know that we're passing over the very
[2:27:07] place where your family was lost in the
[2:27:10] storm."
[2:27:12] And he went over to the table and began
[2:27:14] to write these words. When peace like a
[2:27:18] river attendeth my way, when sorrows
[2:27:23] like sea billows roll, whatever my lot,
[2:27:27] thou hast taught me to say, it is well
[2:27:31] &gt;&gt; with my soul.
[2:27:34] My favorite verse,
[2:27:37] my sin,
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; not not in part,
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; but the whole. Let's sing that tonight
[2:27:45] before we leave. It's our anthem
[2:27:48] [Music]
[2:27:55] when peace
[2:27:58] like a river
[2:28:03] attendeth
[2:28:06] my way.
[2:28:09] In sorrows
[2:28:13] I see
[2:28:16] those ro
[2:28:20] [Music]
[2:28:23] whatever
[2:28:25] [Applause]
[2:28:25] [Music]
[2:28:27] my law thou has taught
[2:28:32] me to sing.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; After hearing a message like that, you
[2:28:37] ought to be able to sing this. It is
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; and know it's the truth with my soul.
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:28:49] &gt;&gt; And it is well
[2:28:53] it is well
[2:28:56] with my soul.
[2:29:00] With my soul
[2:29:03] and it is well.
[2:29:07] It is well
[2:29:10] with my soul.
[2:29:16] Praise the Lord. Though Satan
[2:29:20] [Music]
[2:29:22] should not
[2:29:24] fail, he does
[2:29:25] &gt;&gt; and those trials
[2:29:28] will come.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; Let this blessed assurance.
[2:29:36] The sh
[2:29:39] country Christ have regarded my
[2:29:43] helpless.
[2:29:44] Oh that
[2:29:48] [Music]
[2:29:50] regard
[2:29:52] in my head
[2:29:55] [Music]
[2:29:59] and have shed
[2:30:02] his own blood
[2:30:06] for my soul
[2:30:10] [Music]
[2:30:12] and It is well.
[2:30:16] It is well
[2:30:20] with my soul.
[2:30:23] with my soul.
[2:30:27] It is well. Oh, it is well
[2:30:34] with my soul.
[2:30:41] I send all the bless. I see
[2:30:44] all the bliss. Smile while you sing.
[2:30:50] &gt;&gt; Glorious
[2:30:51] [Music]
[2:30:53] Lord. My s
[2:30:58] not in heart
[2:31:01] [Music]
[2:31:03] the whole
[2:31:06] glory
[2:31:10] is
[2:31:12] to the cross
[2:31:15] and I
[2:31:19] love
[2:31:22] your Praise the Lord.
[2:31:25] Praise the Lord,
[2:31:29] oh my soul.
[2:31:35] And it is well.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; It is well
[2:31:43] with my soul.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; with my soul.
[2:31:50] It is well.
[2:31:53] It is well
[2:31:57] with my soul.
[2:32:02] Yes. Yes. Yes.
[2:32:04] Oh my sin.
[2:32:08] Oh, the bliss
[2:32:11] of this glorious
[2:32:14] [Music]
[2:32:16] Lord. I see. Oh, that might see
[2:32:22] not
[2:32:23] [Applause]
[2:32:24] [Music]
[2:32:29] every
[2:32:34] [Music]
[2:32:37] cross
[2:32:38] [Music]
[2:32:46] praise the high.
[2:32:49] Praise
[2:32:51] the Lord.
[2:32:53] Oh my soul,
[2:32:59] [Music]
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; it is.
[2:33:04] It is well
[2:33:07] with my soul.
[2:33:11] with my soul.
[2:33:14] It is well,
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; it is well
[2:33:22] with my soul.
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; Now sing the last verse.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:33:30] And Lord,
[2:33:32] haste the day.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; Haste the day. With my faith with my
[2:33:38] faith, faith shall be sil.
[2:33:43] Oh no,
[2:33:47] we roll back
[2:33:50] as
[2:33:57] [Applause]
[2:33:58] the
[2:34:00] shout.
[2:34:05] [Music]
[2:34:11] Yes, even
[2:34:13] so. Oh, it is well
[2:34:18] with my soul.
[2:34:23] Last time sing it. It is well.
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; It is well.
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; Nobody can testify of that for you but
[2:34:31] you. With my soul.
[2:34:35] &gt;&gt; With my soul.
[2:34:40] Yeah. It is well.
[2:34:44] It is well
[2:34:47] with my soul.
[2:34:52] [Music]
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you Jesus.
[2:35:00] Thank you Jesus.
[2:35:03] &gt;&gt; Lord because of that revelation we don't
[2:35:05] have to wallow
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; in condemnation and guilt.
[2:35:10] Because of that revelation, we know that
[2:35:12] every sin, all unbelief, nailed to the
[2:35:15] cross,
[2:35:18] &gt;&gt; not in part,
[2:35:20] but all of it.
[2:35:22] all that's behind me, all that I may be
[2:35:25] walking through now, and any that I
[2:35:27] would walk through in the future, if
[2:35:29] unbelief should ever manifest itself in
[2:35:32] any form in my life, all I have to do is
[2:35:35] bring myself back under the authority of
[2:35:37] the blood, the word, and the grace of
[2:35:40] Almighty God,
[2:35:42] and my fellowship can be restored. Lord,
[2:35:45] I thank you that the fall in the garden
[2:35:49] did not change Adam's relationship with
[2:35:51] you. It changed his fellowship.
[2:35:55] He was always a son. And there's been
[2:35:58] many times in our life that our
[2:36:00] fellowship with you was affected by our
[2:36:02] own decisions and our stubborn will. But
[2:36:06] Lord, because of what we heard tonight,
[2:36:10] we were sons.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; We were sons.
[2:36:14] That's grace that I after all these
[2:36:17] years, I still can't quite get my head
[2:36:20] around it. And I thank you designed it
[2:36:23] that way
[2:36:25] so that we would have to depend on you.
[2:36:28] Lord, thank you for the word we heard
[2:36:30] tonight. And we don't always feel that,
[2:36:34] but it's not by feelings we march
[2:36:36] forward. It's by faith.
[2:36:39] And I thank you tonight for a servant,
[2:36:42] Lord, who would deliver his heart to us
[2:36:46] in language that we could understand and
[2:36:48] follow. I thank you for the sacrifice he
[2:36:51] made to be here. And I pray, Lord, that
[2:36:54] you would restore back to him any
[2:36:56] strength and virtue that was lost. And
[2:36:59] you'd place a new and fresh inspiration
[2:37:01] upon him.
[2:37:03] And Lord, I pray that even in the latter
[2:37:06] years of his life, that there would be
[2:37:08] increase of your anointing
[2:37:12] and that there would be increase of your
[2:37:15] many blessings and benefits. Thank you
[2:37:18] for giving him a sound body, a strong
[2:37:20] body, Lord, that he's been able to go
[2:37:23] and go and go. And Father, I pray that
[2:37:26] he will see fruit
[2:37:28] from his labor.
[2:37:30] I thank you for your precious oil
[2:37:34] that uh soothes every wound and every
[2:37:39] every openness in us. And you seal us
[2:37:44] for that purpose, that destiny
[2:37:48] that you chose for us before the
[2:37:51] foundation of the world. Lord, a message
[2:37:55] like we heard tonight just really makes
[2:37:57] us want to be alone with you.
[2:38:00] May we find that time. May we make that
[2:38:03] time
[2:38:05] that you would be a priority in our
[2:38:07] life. Hearing the word, reading the
[2:38:09] word, sitting at your feet, and
[2:38:13] worshiping you,
[2:38:16] being those little creators that he
[2:38:18] talked about tonight, changing the
[2:38:21] atmosphere around us by the creative
[2:38:24] nature of what you've done in us. We
[2:38:27] kept seeing that theme, Lord. uh saying
[2:38:30] the right thing. May we may we say the
[2:38:33] right thing. May May our confession line
[2:38:36] up with what we know.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; May we declare it. May we decree it. May
[2:38:43] we prophesy it.
[2:38:46] May every member of our body line up.
[2:38:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, in the physical, let every system
[2:38:52] of our body obey the design of the
[2:38:55] creator. Heal right now, Lord. release
[2:38:59] your healing. The price was paid
[2:39:02] already. It's ours. We access it by
[2:39:05] faith. It's children's bread. We take it
[2:39:08] tonight. Healing
[2:39:11] not only in body and in physical, but
[2:39:14] Lord, even in the places of our soul
[2:39:16] that have been wounded along the way.
[2:39:19] Heal us, restore us, make us new.
[2:39:24] If there was anybody whose steps were
[2:39:26] slowing, may this word tonight ring in
[2:39:29] their ears.
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; May it be like a cheer coming across
[2:39:34] eternity. And may they run, Lord. May I
[2:39:37] run. May I run faster than I've ever run
[2:39:40] before
[2:39:42] with greater determination because of
[2:39:45] this great reminder that we've heard.
[2:39:48] It's you. It's you, Lord. It's you.
[2:39:52] Anything that we do, anything we
[2:39:55] accomplish, it's you, Lord. To God be
[2:39:57] the glory. Go with us tonight.
[2:40:01] Let this great spirit of the Lord settle
[2:40:03] over us even in our time of fellowship
[2:40:06] and and uh and nourishment and meet us
[2:40:10] tomorrow.
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; Let our faith try to begin to anticipate
[2:40:16] the fullness of your glory that will
[2:40:18] meet us in the morning. We claim it.
[2:40:25] [Music]
[2:40:36] Thank you for letting us see our name.
[2:40:39] [Music]
[2:40:43] Thank you, Lord.
[2:40:47] Thank you for reminding us that not a
[2:40:49] devil in hell.
[2:40:55] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord for the revelation that
[2:40:57] there is a book that our name cannot be
[2:41:00] blotted out of.
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; Your servant taught us there is a book
[2:41:08] of life and a lamb's book of life.
[2:41:13] One of those books, our name can be
[2:41:15] removed. In one of those books, it
[2:41:18] cannot be. Lord, I thank you for letting
[2:41:21] us see our name in the Lamb's Book of
[2:41:23] Life this evening,
[2:41:26] knowing that whatever it requires,
[2:41:30] you're going to have your reward in us.
[2:41:34] It can come easy or hard. It depends on
[2:41:38] the depth of our surrender. Lord,
[2:41:40] tonight we surrender. Would you
[2:41:42] surrender with me, Lord? We surrender
[2:41:45] tonight. To the best of our ability, to
[2:41:47] the best of our knowing, we surrender.
[2:41:50] Any part,
[2:41:52] put your finger on it, Jesus.
[2:41:55] &gt;&gt; Show us any part of us.
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; Any thought in our mind, any emotion
[2:42:01] that controls us
[2:42:04] that is not yet submitted to what your
[2:42:08] word says about us. Give us the grace to
[2:42:11] to pay the price to surrender. Your
[2:42:14] prophet said you've gone as far with God
[2:42:16] as you're ever going to go until you're
[2:42:18] willing to pay a greater price. The
[2:42:20] price that it for our salvation is paid.
[2:42:23] But the price to be an overcomer
[2:42:27] is something that we surrender and yield
[2:42:29] to
[2:42:31] as we sojourn here below. Lord Jesus, I
[2:42:35] want to give you more than I've ever
[2:42:36] given you before.
[2:42:38] I don't think you'll terry long enough
[2:42:40] for me to reach the age that brother
[2:42:43] Thornton told us he was tonight. But I'm
[2:42:46] inspired.
[2:42:48] I'm inspired
[2:42:50] by by a man like that.
[2:42:54] Who who at nearly 83 years of age is
[2:42:57] still reaching reaching for more of who
[2:42:59] you are. Stir up a hunger in us to the
[2:43:03] oldest. Stir up a desire for us to go
[2:43:06] all the way. Lord, in any place that
[2:43:08] we've taken the shortcut, may we go back
[2:43:12] and choose like your prophet did, the
[2:43:15] harder way because we know it's the way
[2:43:18] of reward.
[2:43:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:29] &gt;&gt; Lord, may we fall in love with you all
[2:43:31] over again.
[2:43:34] That's what this kind of preaching ought
[2:43:35] to do in us. And we'll give you glory
[2:43:38] and honor and praise.
[2:43:40] In the mighty matchless name of the Lord
[2:43:43] Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[2:43:47] I don't want to move, but I I think we
[2:43:50] might have to in a minute. Let's sing
[2:43:53] Falling in Love for just a minute before
[2:43:55] we go. Falling in love with Jesus.
[2:44:02] Falling in love
[2:44:05] with Jesus.

[2:44:17] &gt;&gt; Falling in love with Jesus
[2:44:24] was the best thing I've ever
[2:44:27] done. Sing it again before we go.
[2:44:30] Falling in love.
[2:44:32] Falling in love with Jesus.
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; Falling in love. Falling in love with
[2:44:42] Jesus.

[2:44:45] &gt;&gt; Falling in love.

[2:44:56] done.
[2:44:58] Oh,
[2:45:01] cuz in his arms I feel protected.
[2:45:08] And in his arms I'm never disconnected.
[2:45:15] In his arms. That's where I feel
[2:45:19] protected.
[2:45:21] And there's no place I'd rather
[2:45:25] be. Sing that part again. Oh, in his
[2:45:29] arms.
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; In his arms. I feel protected. When I'm
[2:45:35] in his arms. In his arms. I'm never
[2:45:40] disconnected.
[2:45:42] In his arms. In his arms.
[2:45:46] I feel
[2:45:48] protected.
[2:45:50] And there's no place I'd ra
[2:45:53] be.
[2:45:54] &gt;&gt; Falling in love. last week. Oh, I'm
[2:45:56] falling in love, falling in love with
[2:46:01] Jesus.
[2:46:04] Falling in love, falling in love with
[2:46:08] Jesus.
[2:46:10] [Music]
[2:46:11] Falling in love.
[2:46:13] &gt;&gt; Falling in love with my Jesus
