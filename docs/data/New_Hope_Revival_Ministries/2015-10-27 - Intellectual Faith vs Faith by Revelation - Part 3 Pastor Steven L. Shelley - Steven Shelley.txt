TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] well hello there I'm Pastor Steph Shelly and I want to welcome you to today's broadcast you're watching the Eagles cry I pray that something will be said today that will inspire your faith and strengthen you in your walk toward the kingdom of God I just want to start off by telling you Jesus loves you he loves you and he is after your heart he wants you to make a full surrender to him and you might as well give up because he's going to find you he's going to keep working on you dealing with you chasing you if you're a seed of God if he saw you before the foundation of the world in his mind saying a big Eternal yes to him he's going to deal with your heart he's going to follow after you hard until you make that full surrender so I trust if you're uh wavering in your faith today that God will touch you and strengthen you and that you'll just surrender just throw up your hands and say I'm Yours Lord take me I'm a mess sometime I need lots of help but you're the great helper I don't know what's going on in your life but I know that whatever it is he knows how we're talking in this series about the difference between intellectual Faith a mental concept of something and having a revelation of Truth a revelation and we're specifically talking about faith faith can be a mental Concept in other words you can hear a truth and believe it mentally it makes sense it becomes logical and so you say okay I believe that and of course to believe something there has to be some Faith attached to it but what kind of faith and is that faith enough to really get the job done that's what the question is and how do we see a transformation how do we see a a a change a metamorphosis in our intellectual Faith mental concept into a real revelation of faith it takes the Holy Ghost it takes the holy spirit of God I want to give you an example in the scripture in James chapter 2 verse 19 thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe and tremble now I find that to be a fascinating scripture because it tells us that even demons believe well what is it that they believe they believe that there is one God I want to ask you if if you also believe the the scripture because the Bible tells us here oh Israel the Lord our God is one EAD one if you believe the scripture that he is one God of course he is manifesting himself in in actually many different ways but what we are most familiar with and most connected to is Father Son and Holy Spirit and these are divine demonst ations of God characteristics of God ways that he has demonstrated himself to man and we also know by scripture that in the Lord Jesus Christ dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily so if you have just say for instance because we're talking about one God if you have an understanding that he is one although there are many different attributes in God and expressions of God and so forth some people like to call it personalities uh I don't particularly like using that word I don't even like using the word persons because I think people can get really really confused in that and have this image of three gods and we know that there are not three Gods there is only one God and even the demons believe that but the point that we want to get to is in what way do they believe that do they have a spirit revealed uh concept a real Revelation that there is one God or do the demons have only a mental concept that causes them to believe that there is one God well I think they know because they've they've dealt with this living God so I think it is a reality to them but I don't think it's a revelation to them because they are what they are they're demon Spirits opposing the truth of God and God's word but he says the demons believe and they tremble now that's more than some people do they don't only believe they tremble at the truth the truth causes them to tremble there are scriptures that talk about men trembling at the word of God and I think that is reverential fear that is very very important especially as we approach the end time that we really understand what a privilege it is is to come before the Living God and worship him in spirit and in truth now when you come by uh the spirit of God draws you and you come to faith in the Lord Jesus Christ you repent of your sins you follow him in Christian baptism according to acts 238 uh you're beginning your journey toward an intimate relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ now that that is already the beginning of more than the demon demons have because even though they believe God is one they're not going to repent they're not going to come into an intimate relationship with him because their belief is based on a mental concept I want more than what the demons have I don't want to just believe that there's one God in the same manner the demons believe it I want a pure unadulterated Revelation that there is one God and uh all the other truths that we need to understand in this hour some people say these things are not important but I believe they are I believe it is important to know who God is and who we are when we're in him when we are with him in Intimate relationship who that makes us and what Authority it gives us in the scheme of things we need to understand authority authority is different than power because you can have power without Authority and the power is wasted but if you you have authority and with that Authority you use power then I'm telling you you can get the job done and and even even there in the faith in the church there are a lot of people who understand power but they don't understand Authority and how to operate in that power but God wants to teach us and these things you know we can get the foundation from hearing preachers preach and teach we can we can watch this great television network we can listen to our pastor and get a great Foundation of how the word works but it's not until it is revealed to us by the holy spirit that we really begin look at Acts chapter 16 we just told you that the demons also believe and tremble but look at acts 16: 30 and 31 and brought them out and said s what must I do to be saved that's something you'll never hear a demon say that's something the devil will never say because their belief is in mental concept only they have no Revelation demons have no Revelation to to then do the right thing with what they say they believe believe here's what he said what must I do to be saved and they answered him believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house so there is Faith in Believing on the the Lord Jesus Christ that's the beginning of the journey there are many many many other precious truths that God wants to make real to you and he does that by the power of the Holy Spirit we've been studying the life of Peter and you know Peter gets a hard time in churches sometime and uh in other churches he's perhaps exonerated to a place of uh of being the first pope and and the whole church is built on him and so forth so either Peter have a I mean either people have a a blowed up uh understanding of Peter where they almost deify him or they uh almost demonize him you know because he is after all the one who denied the Lord yes he did but remember he didn't deny who the Lord was he knew that by Revelation but he denied that he had anything to do with him is that not terrible yes it's terrible he denied his relationship but many of us have also done the same things and God didn't throw him out oh no God continued to use Peter his best days were actually ahead of him now he wept bitterly I mean he was very very upset I think I shared that with you in the first lesson on this from Luke 22 and 62 it says and Peter went out and wept bitterly when he heard that rooster preaching when he heard that rooster crowing he he went out and wept bitterly but what Peter really needed he had a revelation uh that Jesus was the son of the Living God that's powerful but he needed something else and that was about to happen in the life of Peter I do not believe that Peter would have ever denied his relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ had that happened after the day of Pentecost shavel o I believe on that day Peter became a new being he was plunged into a revelation he now had God living on the inside of the inside of him I wasn't planning to read this to you but let's glance at it quickly together since we have the opportunity to do so let's look at the book of Acts you know a lot of people call this maybe it's even written in your Bible The Acts of the Apostles well I think that's a nice way of of of remembering these Great Men of God but I want you to know that's not what this book of the Bible is about it's not about the acts of men it's about the acts of the Holy Spirit the holy ghost in the lives of men I'm telling you that is what makes the difference men can do great things on their own with their own good character but not to the extent not nearly to the degree that we we can accomplish wonderful and glorious things when we do it in the power and authority of the Holy Spirit Acts chapter 2 it talks about chavot the Feast of the the of the Hebrew Bible and and a very important time of commemorating the giving of the instruction by by God to Moses the giving of the of the Torah the giving of the law and they're gathered here in Acts chapter 2 commemorating one of the three Pilgrim Feast where all Hebrew males are commanded to go up to Jerusalem to worship and here they're all gathered in Jerusalem for chavot this beautiful Festival of the Lord and remember these are not Jewish festivals these are festivals of Jehovah God they are festivals of the Lord and when the day of Pentecost that's Acts 2 verse1 and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place that is unity and you know I have many many friends who identify with their Jewish Heritage and they will often make that joke it's almost impossible to get that many Jewish people in a room and all agree well I think it's true about all kinds of races ethnicities and Faith don't you just when you get people together it's hard to always agree on everything even in the New Testament Church chur we struggle with those kinds of things but here they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly I I want you to know that the suddenlies of God can make a tremendous difference in our lives we wait and we wait and we wait and we worry and we pray and sometimes we doubt and we wait and we pray and we get incouraged and then discouraged we have hope and then hopelessness and then suddenly God comes on the scene and changes everything Hallelujah and he wants to bring suddenly in our lives he's setting them up right now what you're going through right now is God setting you up for a suddenly I have a friend who's been battling that demon of cancer and he said to me the other day I had suddenly it came and suddenly it's going to leave he said I'm I I plan to be the shortest cancer patient in history uh uh it it came on me one day and left me the next day and you know that's that's a suddenly of God and is that possible it is absolutely possible with his stripes they were we were healed it is a promise it is a part of the atoning work of the Lord Jesus Christ that we can also be healed and not only healed but we can begin to move by by faith in Divine Health that's what we're looking for that God would just bring us to a place where we would be in in full order our bodies would be optimal so that we could do everything that we need to do for the work of the Lord in this hour until we get the next body at the end of this thing and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing mighty wind it filled all the house where they were sitting now it doesn't actually say there was a wind it says there was a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind I think that it is written that way particularly because God wants to reveal to us the power of sound I want you to know that there are important things that happen with sound in our bodies and and there are sounds heavenly sound sounds that I have been privileged to hear at times in Services where men and women were worshiping the Lord using their own voices using their own talents just totally surrendered and there would come a sound into the room that was not of this Earth but was of heaven and when the sound of Heaven invades the Earth things are going to change that's why worship is a very one of the reasons why worshiping the Lord is such an important part of following hard after God because when we worship it opens up the heavens and sound of heaven and power from Heaven light from Heaven is is able then to penetrate into the Earth and so I think it's important that heaven's sound was released this day it filled all the house where they were sitting the sound filled the house and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them what an identification what a a marking of the holy spirit that that he came like fire like tongues of fire and sat upon each of them who were gathered that day in one Accord verse four and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance there are many denominational churches around who will tell us this was only for the for the book of Acts this was only for the days of the Apostles they needed it I've had men sit down and try to tell me for over an hour how the the early church needed these Miracles they had to have these demonstrations of the Holy Spirit but we no longer need them and we no longer have to have them to today I want you to know I don't believe in that kind of sensation I don't believe that God puts something in his body and then has taken it away from us I don't believe that at all in fact I believe that the hour that we're living in right now is the most wicked and evil hour that the people of God have ever faced in the history of mankind and if we ever needed the power of the Holy Ghost if we ever needed the gifts of the Spirit even as much as they needed it right here in second temple period it's today right now we need the Living God to manifest himself by his spirit in our lives in our churches in our prayer meetings we need the the nine gifts of the Spirit and the other gifts of the Spirit that are mentioned in other places we often focus on the nine but there are many gifts of the holy spirit spoken about in the New Testament we want to have those as a part of our lives we want to be a part of cooperating with those gifts so that God can have his way in us they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and there was dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language look what God was doing he was raising up evangelists who are supernaturally able to speak the language of other nations and this is one of the demonstrations of the holy spirit with speaking in tongues the Bible also tells us that there are tongues of angels and there are unknown languages that are also given by the spirit but I think of course here the biggest glory is when God does something like this he lets people speak supernaturally in languages that they have never learned and the people said to one another behold are not all these galileans how is it that we hear our own dialects our own uh national languages and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what meth this that was verse 12 in verse uh 13 it says others mocking said these men are full of new wine they're drunk they're just a bunch of sloshes they're drunk but Peter verse 14 who Peter this same Peter Simon the son of Jonah who denied the Lord who went out and wept bitterly the one that Jesus rebuked the one that Jesus looked at and said get thee behind me Satan uh but he's also the same one that Jesus said Peter Satan has desired to sift you his wheat but I have prayed for you I tell you Peter was there Peter wasn't just in the upper room in verse 14 but he was was in the upper room in the first few verses when they were all filled with the Holy Ghost verse four and because of Peter being filled with the Holy Ghost his whole Paradigm his whole mental concept shifted and he is now thinking by the spirit and not by carnal mental conceptions and he stands up verse 14 with the 11 and lifted up his voice and said unto them ye men of Judea and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words what has happened to Peter he has courage he is no longer just a a a little read shaken around in the wind he's no longer a a denier he is now a proclaimer he is absolutely uh an apostle he got his full commissioning here and with boldness not denying to the little washwoman denying to the little uh uh you know servants that he even knows the Lord now he's saying all men of that dwell in Jerusalem I tell you I like that boldness that he had listen to me he said for these are not drunken as ye suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the land last days verse 17 saith God I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I will show wonders in Heaven above and signs in the earth beneath blood and fire and Vapor of smoke verse 20 the sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and notable day of the Lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved he's giving what we've come to call an altar call he's giving an invitation now you need to accept this Lord Jesus Christ ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as ye yourselves also know and he goes on to tell them what they did you delivered him to the determinate counsel and you uh him being delivered by the determinant counsel and forn knowledge of God ye have taken and by Wicked hands have crucified and slain whom God hath raised up having loose the pain of death because it was not possible that he should be Holden of it for David speaketh concerning him now he's going into the deep Prophecies of the scripture which they're very familiar with uh he said for David speaketh concerning him in verse 25 I foresaw the lord always before my face for he is on my right hand that I should not be moved and he goes on and he names many Messianic prophecies Promises of his coming all the way it goes down verse after verse after verse to 37 you read it when you get a chance read it all it's great now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do this is the question we need to be asking when God shows up and breathes Revelation on his word what shall we do shall we continue in our traditions of men shall we continue in dogmas and Creeds and dead religion or will we make a new change a new start and Peter had an answer oh yes he did bold repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and I like this for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are AAR off even as many as the Lord Our God should call what are you folk going to do with that verse when you come around and tell us that this Holy Ghost was only for the early Apostles what are you going to do with this for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that's me all that are a far off that's you and this promise of the Holy Ghost is ours even as many as the Lord Our God shall call did God call you did you hear God calling you in the spirit to come to him in faith to repent to believe the truth of the scripture then you're one of these position to receive this promise if you haven't already and with many other words my he didn't stop there he kept on preaching and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save save yourselves from this unto generation then they that gladly received the word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 souls and it goes on to tell us how God began to establish them and and and and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and breaking of bread and prayers and it goes on and says and they continued daily with one Accord in the temple breaking bread from house to house praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved this was an amazing glorious Hallelujah camp meeting day wasn't it and it was during this moment that Peter got the Revelation that he needed to go forward I'm going to pray that God will give you this same Revelation and fill you with the Holy Ghost and Fire father if there's someone watching right now that has not received the baptism of the Holy Ghost I ask you to fill them Lord show them in your word to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then fill them with that holy ghost power thank you Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen got to go but tune in again next time there's more watch the Eagles cry again bye-bye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music]
