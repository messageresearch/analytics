[57:36] uh direction for us this week we had a
[57:39] good service here Tuesday night how many
[57:41] of you enjoyed the ministry of brother
[57:43] farmer I mean it was
[57:45] outstanding and I thought about it
[57:48] replayed it in my mind and got blessed
[57:50] all over again I've not watched it again
[57:53] but I've played it in my mind again and
[57:55] we were just blessed it just worked out
[57:58] I was not feeling very well at all but I
[58:01] asked for the farmer before that
[58:02] happened and then I thought Lord you had
[58:05] everything under control you did and we
[58:08] decided to get up Wednesday morning
[58:10] anyway just my wife and I boy that felt
[58:13] so
[58:14] strange uh three of the kids in Virginia
[58:17] for the annual tent meetings there and I
[58:21] don't know how many I don't know how
[58:22] many are there but there are hundreds of
[58:24] Believers gathered in that in that
[58:26] Valley and that big old white tent and
[58:28] God is meeting needs and I've heard uh
[58:31] some of the preaching and his a lot of
[58:33] what I've heard has been
[58:35] outstanding and uh we're thankful I'm
[58:39] thankful that they're under the word I
[58:42] very much would like to have had them
[58:43] with me today but I am thankful that
[58:45] they're sitting under the word of the
[58:47] hour I'm thankful they're not stuck in a
[58:49] denominational church somewhere today
[58:52] I'm thankful they're not in a
[58:53] charismatic church today I'm thankful
[58:56] that they're sitting where the full
[58:58] Council of God's word is going to be
[59:00] preached and uh I know needs are going
[59:03] to be met and they have a lot of fun
[59:05] meeting people that I have known Through
[59:07] The Years uh someone offered Joshua a a
[59:11] uh golf cart ride it's down in a valley
[59:15] and to get to the bathroom is a hike up
[59:17] a hill and uh so those Brothers they
[59:20] they like to run it's like byc you know
[59:23] the ones that gets the golf carts they
[59:24] like to use them I think yeah and so
[59:27] here come Joshua out and he he said
[59:29] would you like a ride and he saidwell I
[59:30] don't really need well okay if you're
[59:32] offering I'll take a ride and he got in
[59:35] and asked him uh who he was and where he
[59:37] was from and he and uh brother horn
[59:40] couldn't believe that that he was my son
[59:43] and uh he began to tell him stories I I
[59:46] kind of like to be there to defend
[59:48] myself you
[59:50] know I said well if you see him today
[59:52] you tell him I haven't ever forgot the
[59:54] night he kept me up all all night long
[59:58] talking he was preaching to me I had
[1:00:01] preached until I couldn't stand up and
[1:00:04] then he he got under the inspiration and
[1:00:06] then he preached to me till the sun come
[1:00:08] up in my room finally I said you're gone
[1:00:11] you're leaving
[1:00:13] brother but anyway so we had we had a
[1:00:16] great time I uh I did appreciate your
[1:00:18] prayers the Lord did help me and uh so
[1:00:22] did the shots and I'm thankful this is
[1:00:25] one of those times that I'm very
[1:00:27] thankful that I could get some help that
[1:00:29] would that would uh work pretty quickly
[1:00:32] and uh so we have had a very lovely time
[1:00:34] away for three nights uh there's nothing
[1:00:38] if you're feeling a little low you get a
[1:00:40] little blue sometime there's nothing
[1:00:42] like the sun you don't have to be at the
[1:00:45] beach I know we think we do you can you
[1:00:47] can sit in a lawn chair in your yard and
[1:00:50] soak up and it's not my mind it's
[1:00:53] actually scientific fact it's proof
[1:00:56] and uh of course if you if you slather
[1:00:59] on too much chemical then uh you're
[1:01:02] blocking all the good benefits that you
[1:01:04] get from the Sun but I can feel my mood
[1:01:07] rising up I I can feel myself uh being
[1:01:10] refreshed and we need that from time to
[1:01:13] time God is good amen so uh we want to
[1:01:18] we want to welcome Cade this morning uh
[1:01:20] this is his first Sunday officially
[1:01:23] since he has made Alabama his resident
[1:01:26] so let's welcome
[1:01:33] him we're very very grateful we believe
[1:01:36] the Lord knows exactly what he's doing
[1:01:39] his time timing is always just right
[1:01:43] there are there are many gifts in the
[1:01:46] body of Christ and there are many gifts
[1:01:48] in this body none of them alike none of
[1:01:52] them the same and they shouldn't ever
[1:01:55] try
[1:01:56] to be one like the
[1:01:59] other many men have ruined their
[1:02:02] Ministry by trying to be Cowboys when
[1:02:04] they weren't
[1:02:06] Cowboys if you're not a man I'm not a
[1:02:08] cowboy I'm not a man of the Wilderness
[1:02:10] and I'm not going to try to make myself
[1:02:12] a man of the Wilderness and uh so many
[1:02:15] people have given up their identity to
[1:02:17] try to be like somebody else you don't
[1:02:20] have to but what you do have to do
[1:02:21] brother sister is rise to the highest
[1:02:25] point of the call that God has placed on
[1:02:28] your
[1:02:29] life there's one thing I have very
[1:02:31] little tolerance for and that's for
[1:02:33] somebody who says something like this
[1:02:35] boy I'd love to play the piano like
[1:02:40] that that really gets my goat first of
[1:02:44] all it's a
[1:02:45] lie you're not even telling the truth
[1:02:49] you're not even being honest with
[1:02:50] yourself when you say something like
[1:02:52] that somebody said what in the world do
[1:02:54] you mean by that I mean if if you don't
[1:02:56] even
[1:02:57] try have you ever took a
[1:03:01] lesson have I I couldn't afford a let
[1:03:04] did you ever ask sister Wes to sit down
[1:03:06] on the piano and show you a
[1:03:07] lick a lot of these other musicians did
[1:03:11] see no what you mean is you'd like to
[1:03:13] wake up and be like that little girl
[1:03:15] that the go Holy Ghost fell on and she
[1:03:17] never learned to lick and she just
[1:03:18] played well that is a very rare gift it
[1:03:21] doesn't happen very often but the proof
[1:03:24] of the desire right
[1:03:26] is in the pursuit right and so you may
[1:03:29] never play the piano like someone else
[1:03:32] you may never sing like someone else you
[1:03:35] may never preach like someone else but
[1:03:37] you can rise to the very highest point
[1:03:40] of the gift and the calling of God that
[1:03:42] he has placed in your life jealousy is
[1:03:46] cruler than the grave it's the biggest
[1:03:50] torment in the body of Christ in this
[1:03:52] hour is
[1:03:54] self-comparison don't you comp compare
[1:03:56] yourself with anybody else there is only
[1:03:59] one of you and you know what I say to
[1:04:00] that thank
[1:04:03] God and that's a good thank God and and
[1:04:06] it's a real thank God we couldn't handle
[1:04:09] but one of you you couldn't handle but
[1:04:11] one of me so don't you ever sit on a Pew
[1:04:15] and measure yourself up try to fit
[1:04:18] yourself or make yourself or wished or
[1:04:21] uh uh I would I would catch more
[1:04:23] attention or or I would get the girl or
[1:04:25] or something stupid like that come on
[1:04:29] you just let God but if you have a
[1:04:32] desire if you have a desire to play you
[1:04:35] can play you may not be gifted to play
[1:04:37] but you can play you can take
[1:04:41] lessons you can you can play I Can Read
[1:04:44] I can write I can sew my daddy shirts
[1:04:48] you can play that if you want to be used
[1:04:51] of God you have to give him what you
[1:04:53] already possess what you already have
[1:04:57] and you offer it up to him and you use
[1:04:59] it for his glory with a prayer of
[1:05:01] dedication God I want this to grow I
[1:05:03] want it to bring glory and honor to your
[1:05:05] name they are very talented musicians
[1:05:09] who can play behind someone or accompany
[1:05:12] someone and their gift is for
[1:05:14] accompanying someone who's singing and
[1:05:17] they're not lead pianists and then there
[1:05:19] are those who are lead pianists and uh
[1:05:22] lead guitarist and then there there are
[1:05:24] other guitar players that fill in and
[1:05:26] without them it would sound it would
[1:05:28] sound
[1:05:29] empty because you need that filling in
[1:05:33] and and I realize that a fill someone
[1:05:35] filling in the strings doesn't get as
[1:05:37] much attention as as someone who's
[1:05:40] twanging a a lead
[1:05:42] line but we're we're in a body of Christ
[1:05:46] and we're finding our place and where we
[1:05:47] fit and where we belong and don't you
[1:05:50] ever let the enemy discount you in your
[1:05:53] own mind amen uh I I was telling them
[1:05:57] you know uh there are certain songs that
[1:06:00] I have wanted to sing my whole life I
[1:06:03] even sang One for brother brother gy
[1:06:06] that I've wanted to sing for several
[1:06:07] years and it sounds simple but I I I
[1:06:11] talked Mar Beth into coming up here a
[1:06:13] couple three years four years ago on a
[1:06:16] Saturday and we worked on that song and
[1:06:18] it certainly had nothing to do with her
[1:06:20] I never could sing that song and it
[1:06:23] really disappointed me that I couldn't I
[1:06:25] really wanted to sing that song but you
[1:06:28] know what there there's got to be a
[1:06:31] reason God didn't give it to
[1:06:34] me everybody has has got to be who God
[1:06:38] has created them to be amen I don't know
[1:06:41] why I said that except for the fact that
[1:06:44] when I was going to mention Cade I also
[1:06:47] wanted to mention that there is there is
[1:06:49] a touch uh on his music uh that is is
[1:06:54] minstral psalmist like like it it speaks
[1:06:57] it bypasses my soul it speaks to the to
[1:07:00] the inside of the inside and I'm very
[1:07:03] very thankful for that and it only means
[1:07:07] a different gift it doesn't mean a
[1:07:08] better gift or a higher gift I don't
[1:07:11] know what in this world we would have
[1:07:12] done without sister Laurel through these
[1:07:14] years she is the most faithful and
[1:07:17] accomplished musician that I have ever
[1:07:19] known and she has she is willing to give
[1:07:23] up her time
[1:07:25] so many many many times and uh I like to
[1:07:29] tell that she was in labor and still at
[1:07:35] the post of
[1:07:37] Duty I verified it with her a few weeks
[1:07:40] ago because we had a we had a a sister
[1:07:43] who's water broke working here on the
[1:07:46] campground and I didn't think that was
[1:07:48] Sister Laurel but I knew that that
[1:07:51] wonderful watch Night Service she was in
[1:07:54] labor and we said to her I know there
[1:07:57] was some who said to her you you you
[1:07:59] know you don't have to do this she never
[1:08:02] took a second thought she sat there on
[1:08:05] the piano in labor I want to say it
[1:08:07] again in
[1:08:10] labor labor
[1:08:12] pains not pregnancy
[1:08:15] uncomfortableness how do you know it was
[1:08:17] labor pains because she left the and and
[1:08:21] her background is a lot more
[1:08:22] conservative even than mine and she's
[1:08:25] embarassed Ed by talking about her
[1:08:29] labor it's almost a lifetime ago but we
[1:08:34] know it was the real kind because she
[1:08:36] left the piano somewhere over in the
[1:08:38] service it was sister ny's first first
[1:08:41] weekend with us from Jerusalem and she
[1:08:44] left the service and went and had
[1:08:46] Zion before
[1:08:51] midnight so you know uh we we need to
[1:08:55] and sister West you know she she has
[1:08:58] brought that old sound that has been so
[1:09:00] comforting to me through the years I
[1:09:03] miss brother Steve
[1:09:06] Curry I got a feeling that Steve Curry
[1:09:09] would would have really loved
[1:09:11] Kate I got a feeling that he would I can
[1:09:14] almost see him knuckling them on the top
[1:09:15] of his head you know and um so anyway
[1:09:19] and we're just blessed blessed we're
[1:09:22] blessed sister sha has a song that she
[1:09:24] was working on for the service and the
[1:09:26] musicians weren't quite comfortable
[1:09:27] enough to play it today but it's coming

[1:14:49] appreciate Benjamin and and Joseph
[1:14:53] taking their time
[1:14:55] to travel this week to get kad's things
[1:14:59] and get them back for him because he
[1:15:01] starts his new job
[1:15:05] tomorrow Benjamin and Joseph attended
[1:15:09] church there where Kate has been for
[1:15:12] about a year brother Josh Bennett and um
[1:15:17] he found out that uh among those who
[1:15:20] were there either members or visitors or
[1:15:21] whatever they were that we have we have
[1:15:24] a lot of streamers
[1:15:25] we have a lot of folks streaming a man
[1:15:28] introduced himself to Benjamin at the
[1:15:29] end of the service and he Saidi told my
[1:15:32] wife when you walked in that's our
[1:15:34] favorite worship leader going right
[1:15:36] there and she said now I'm up close I
[1:15:39] know it's you so uh you never know what
[1:15:42] kind of a blessing your worship is to
[1:15:45] other people the atmosphere that you
[1:15:47] create it is vitally important be seated
[1:15:50] just a
[1:15:53] moment uh
[1:15:55] I want to just say something to you very
[1:15:57] quickly and then we'll go right to the
[1:15:59] word forgive me but uh I I made a post
[1:16:04] last Monday I think it was concerning
[1:16:08] another
[1:16:09] Ministry some of you may not have saw
[1:16:11] that uh it it goes out to a special list
[1:16:15] one I've been on I've been on social
[1:16:17] media so long that I have some tools
[1:16:21] that are no longer available and
[1:16:24] thankfully they hadn't taken them away
[1:16:26] from me but I can and maybe you can too
[1:16:28] I don't know for sure but on my computer
[1:16:31] in the beginning I created custom
[1:16:34] lists and um I tried through the years
[1:16:38] when I added a friend or a friend added
[1:16:40] me to to categorize those friends so
[1:16:42] that if the if the day ever arose that I
[1:16:45] wanted to Target an audience I could do
[1:16:49] that and so I have a group of those who
[1:16:51] follow the ministry of brother brandom
[1:16:53] and and there are
[1:16:55] about 4,000 5,000 people on it and so I
[1:17:01] uh when I woke up Monday morning someone
[1:17:03] had sent me a clip of of another church
[1:17:06] and I like to keep my nose where it
[1:17:09] belongs this is lots to keep up with
[1:17:12] around here and uh I don't like to be in
[1:17:16] the middle of everybody's stuff if I can
[1:17:18] help it but before I ever got out of bed
[1:17:21] on Monday and I wasn't late Rising
[1:17:24] someone had sent me a clip of a of a
[1:17:27] preacher who was rip
[1:17:29] raring
[1:17:31] snorting
[1:17:33] mad just
[1:17:35] mad and I thought well I'm I'll listen
[1:17:38] to it because I may be in it there was
[1:17:41] no
[1:17:42] explanation and I dodged the bullet sort
[1:17:45] of but there was uh another good
[1:17:48] Minister that I I admire and
[1:17:51] respect whose name was being called very
[1:17:55] um blatantly and angrily and and
[1:17:58] hatefully to be honest with you it in
[1:18:01] such a way that it just hurt my heart
[1:18:04] and uh it hurt me in such a way that
[1:18:07] after all these years of having this
[1:18:09] this precious message that I really
[1:18:12] thought that all the civil wars were
[1:18:14] finished I was in them and I know what
[1:18:17] they were like and I was really thinking
[1:18:20] that that we weren't we weren't going to
[1:18:22] have to go back to something like that
[1:18:24] but but one of I I wouldn't even call
[1:18:27] the minister a good friend he's just a
[1:18:29] man I respect and I and I made a post
[1:18:32] and I just honored him on that uh list
[1:18:35] as a general he was in brother bram's
[1:18:38] meetings as a young man and he is
[1:18:40] pastored the same church all of these
[1:18:42] years in Louisiana and when when I am am
[1:18:48] hungry when when I when I have listened
[1:18:50] to the prophet and I do that every week
[1:18:53] when I have listened to the prophet and
[1:18:55] I just want something that's kind of
[1:18:57] updated for me right now he is where I
[1:19:00] go and there are several you who do go
[1:19:03] to brother Tim pu's Ministry and uh he's
[1:19:07] he's long- winded and uh he's word-based
[1:19:11] and there are probably things that I
[1:19:14] know for sure there are a few things
[1:19:16] that we might not see eye to eye on but
[1:19:18] folks what does that really matter at
[1:19:20] the end of the
[1:19:22] day what would you do if you found two
[1:19:24] men who agreed on every little letter of
[1:19:29] application we know the word is
[1:19:31] right but but we we might not all apply
[1:19:34] it the same way and there may be those
[1:19:37] who have Christmas and there may be
[1:19:39] those who do some things that I wouldn't
[1:19:42] do or don't want to do but I can spit
[1:19:45] that out most of the time when someone
[1:19:48] has had a Ministry really dedicated to
[1:19:51] to helping the young people especially
[1:19:54] and those camps in Louisiana we never
[1:19:57] participated in them in the early days
[1:20:00] they were always on Easter Sunday and in
[1:20:02] those days we were still Easter people
[1:20:05] and we had special services on the
[1:20:07] Easter weekend all the way from sunrise
[1:20:10] service through and we just never really
[1:20:13] sent our young people that way because
[1:20:16] we we enjoyed having them at home and uh
[1:20:20] as the years went by some of the young
[1:20:21] people would go and they would be
[1:20:22] blessed always a prayer line on a
[1:20:25] Saturday night always sister Rebecca can
[1:20:28] testify to you because she was there
[1:20:30] many times as a young girl younger woman
[1:20:33] younger girl how old were you when you
[1:20:35] were in those
[1:20:41] camps and and and you can testify that
[1:20:44] they were a blessing you have done so in
[1:20:47] your life and uh well you young people
[1:20:51] get
[1:20:52] excited I don't guess we've ever had
[1:20:54] much of that that around here huh young
[1:20:56] people get excited and they dance and
[1:20:59] they and they jump up and down and they
[1:21:01] go through the prayer line and they get
[1:21:02] blessed and they get helped and one of
[1:21:05] the things I appreciated the most about
[1:21:08] this past year or year before last I
[1:21:10] think it was I streamed some of those
[1:21:13] camps and uh is is the thing that that
[1:21:16] brother puit said as the camp was coming
[1:21:18] to end he said now what God has done for
[1:21:21] you in this Camp is for now and it's
[1:21:24] good and it's real but he said you're
[1:21:26] going to have to leave here and feed
[1:21:28] that
[1:21:29] experience you're going to go home and
[1:21:31] you're going to have to keep that fire
[1:21:33] burning and and no pull to get people to
[1:21:36] come there no encouragement to tell
[1:21:39] people that's the only place where God
[1:21:41] is moving but but just go home and feed
[1:21:44] this and and don't be satisfied with a
[1:21:47] feeling but get a relationship because
[1:21:50] you won't always feel it so just a lot
[1:21:52] of wisdom in that and and and so I heard
[1:21:55] this clip and a pastor that I'm very
[1:21:58] well acquainted with was just ripping by
[1:22:01] name and almost mocking in such a way
[1:22:04] that that brought such grief to my heart
[1:22:06] and I thought you know I'm not close
[1:22:08] enough to brother puit to call him on
[1:22:10] the phone and say you know stand firm
[1:22:13] brother or whatever you know I but I
[1:22:15] could I could make a little post here
[1:22:17] and and just give him a little honor and
[1:22:19] and a little bit of respect and so I
[1:22:22] wanted to explain to you why I did that
[1:22:24] on on Monday if you saw it and I would
[1:22:26] have done that Tuesday night but brother
[1:22:28] farmer was here and I didn't think it
[1:22:30] was maybe the right atmosphere to do
[1:22:32] that in but would you just pray and you
[1:22:35] say well would you tell us what it's
[1:22:36] about yeah I
[1:22:39] will uh it it has to do with the gifts
[1:22:43] it has to do with emotion and it has to
[1:22:46] do with how the church is to operate and
[1:22:49] uh I have an answer for all of it the
[1:22:51] prophet told us that every church every
[1:22:53] Church every single church is Sovereign
[1:22:58] there's the
[1:22:59] answer it's it's that's the answer and
[1:23:02] for me to stand here and call another
[1:23:04] pastor's name and tell him how he has is
[1:23:08] to conduct the gifts that his that's
[1:23:09] wrong that's not my place and call it of
[1:23:12] the devil or out of order or not the
[1:23:15] word of the hour is just wrong we don't
[1:23:17] want to get caught up in things like
[1:23:19] that we've got to be seed
[1:23:21] spitters and so I I just want you to
[1:23:24] pray for those involved because you're
[1:23:27] you're sitting in a service like that
[1:23:29] can you imagine sitting in a meeting
[1:23:30] like that and it's pretty gets pretty
[1:23:32] tense there kind of a little tense in
[1:23:34] here and I'm not doing anything so you
[1:23:36] can imagine when when someone's being
[1:23:38] targeted by
[1:23:40] name and uh so I I would like to pray
[1:23:43] for the for the hurt
[1:23:45] people uh a sister that a lot of us know
[1:23:48] made a comment on that post and she said
[1:23:51] it hurts me so much when when preachers
[1:23:54] ERS are are attacking one another and
[1:23:57] you know I think sometime we preachers
[1:23:59] forget that our words have great effect
[1:24:04] and they can wound people who we
[1:24:06] wouldn't even know would be wounded by
[1:24:08] some of the things that we would say I'm
[1:24:10] only mentioning that to answer the three
[1:24:12] or four questions that came in why did
[1:24:14] you make a post like that uh because you
[1:24:16] don't normally just break out and make a
[1:24:19] a post about another Ministry or
[1:24:21] something but you know there is a
[1:24:23] five-fold Ministry in the body of Christ
[1:24:26] and we we we need them we need them all
[1:24:29] and they all bring something very
[1:24:31] special to the table are you with me all
[1:24:34] right let's stand and enough of
[1:24:38] that and
[1:24:41] uh I'd like to go to Jeremiah chapter
[1:24:45] 30 are you up for the word a little bit
[1:24:48] it's 12:22 can I take a little time
[1:24:51] great Jeremiah 30 and 8
[1:24:55] in the King James it says
[1:25:01] first for it shall come to
[1:25:04] pass in that day saith the Lord of
[1:25:09] hosts that I will break his yoke from
[1:25:14] off thy neck that's what we've been
[1:25:17] hearing about and
[1:25:20] will
[1:25:21] burst thy bonds
[1:25:24] we've been hearing about destroying
[1:25:27] yolks now we're hearing a similar phrase
[1:25:31] burst thy bonds and strangers shall no
[1:25:35] more serve themselves of
[1:25:40] him when we look at that in the
[1:25:43] Amplified Bible and I really thankful
[1:25:45] this morning for the for the Amplified
[1:25:48] rendition of this because it catches
[1:25:51] something in the original that the king
[1:25:54] James does not
[1:25:56] express for it will come to pass in that
[1:25:59] day says the Lord of hosts that I will
[1:26:03] break the oppressor Yoke from your neck
[1:26:08] and I will burst your bonds and listen
[1:26:12] at this and strangers will no more make
[1:26:17] slaves of the people of
[1:26:20] Israel does that sound like something
[1:26:22] going on in the Middle East right now
[1:26:25] they are hostages and slaves that are
[1:26:28] still being kept spiritually we have the
[1:26:32] application of the promise that the
[1:26:34] enemy cannot hold us in slavery but one
[1:26:37] of these days in the near future Israel
[1:26:40] is going to get the natural fulfillment
[1:26:42] of that promise she'll never be
[1:26:45] oppressed by strangers again she'll
[1:26:47] never be made slaves of Again by another
[1:26:50] Nation or another people and she will no
[1:26:53] longer be held hostage by her enemies I
[1:26:56] love the way the amplify caught that and
[1:26:59] uh I think it's so real and so relevant
[1:27:03] for where we are today Romans 8 and
[1:27:07] verse 11 one more verse while you're
[1:27:12] standing but if the spirit of him that
[1:27:16] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:27:22] you he that raised up
[1:27:26] Messiah Christ from the dead shall also
[1:27:30] Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit
[1:27:37] that dwelleth in you may God add his
[1:27:39] Blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:27:42] may be seated in the message
[1:27:45] testimony from shreport
[1:27:48] Louisiana brother brandom makes a very
[1:27:51] powerful statement in paragraph 29
[1:27:54] that I want to open with today and and
[1:27:57] this is what he said and as I said last
[1:28:01] night there is a portion and we know
[1:28:05] brother brandham I didn't hear it this
[1:28:07] morning but it's very unlikely that
[1:28:09] brother brandham said portion because he
[1:28:11] didn't use to catch the r he usually
[1:28:14] said
[1:28:15] potion as I said last night there is a
[1:28:19] potion or portion of word laid for every
[1:28:25] age it's all the word of God aren't you
[1:28:28] glad we got the whole thing yes sir but
[1:28:31] there is an alloted portion of word for
[1:28:35] every age now we know that there was an
[1:28:38] allotted portion of the word for the
[1:28:41] last age we're sure of that and for what
[1:28:44] God did a generation ago there was
[1:28:47] certainly a portion of word laid aside
[1:28:50] for that age that was the closing Twi
[1:28:54] light hours of leoda and now we are
[1:28:58] beginning to stretch ourselves out of
[1:29:00] the church ages toward the Millennium
[1:29:03] can you say Amen we we know we know
[1:29:05] we're still encumbered by church anity
[1:29:09] we know that we are still weighted down
[1:29:11] by the lukewarmness of leoda but there
[1:29:15] is something that happens to the
[1:29:17] believer when he or she begins to Feast
[1:29:20] on the word there is a a stimulation
[1:29:24] that Revelation brings that causes him
[1:29:28] or her to take a bite out of the age to
[1:29:32] come and and what a privilege it is to
[1:29:35] live over here still in Satan's Eden so
[1:29:40] to speak and be able to reach Beyond the
[1:29:43] Veil into Millennial Authority and take
[1:29:47] a
[1:29:48] bite oh hallelujah it's like the grapes
[1:29:52] that were brought back on the poles out
[1:29:55] of the land of promise they Those Grapes
[1:29:58] of escol they were able to get a
[1:30:01] sampling of what it was about to be like
[1:30:04] when they took the promised land and so
[1:30:07] the richness of this word of the hour
[1:30:10] the richness of what God does Even in
[1:30:14] our age in our generation in our time is
[1:30:18] he takes that which is yet to come to
[1:30:21] full reality he brings it back to toward
[1:30:24] us we reach toward
[1:30:27] it we're not exactly pulling it into
[1:30:30] time but we are we are reaching toward
[1:30:34] it we're meeting somewhere and it causes
[1:30:37] a stimulation that that brother brandom
[1:30:39] said it's none other than the
[1:30:41] Fulfillment of the scripture we are made
[1:30:44] to sit together in Heavenly places in
[1:30:48] Christ Jesus we never physically have to
[1:30:51] leave the house we never physically have
[1:30:54] to leave this realm but spiritually
[1:30:57] we're lifted up into the word and it
[1:30:59] feeds us and it strengthens us and it
[1:31:03] sustains us it quickens us so there was
[1:31:08] a great portion of the word that was
[1:31:11] laid aside for the last Church age but
[1:31:14] even in the lap over even in the
[1:31:17] stretching period God will emphasize for
[1:31:21] us today certain aspect aspects of the
[1:31:25] word that was laid up for the last age
[1:31:28] it's all the word it's all right it's
[1:31:32] all good it's all helpful beneficial all
[1:31:37] true but he'll come by the anointing
[1:31:41] that's why we need an encounter with the
[1:31:43] anointing we need the the original logos
[1:31:47] among us we need that inspiration that
[1:31:51] will take a portion of that word laid up
[1:31:54] for every age bring it right into us
[1:31:58] right into us even this morning if
[1:32:00] you've got a heart to believe if you've
[1:32:02] got faith to receive it he'll bring the
[1:32:05] word right here to you today he'll
[1:32:08] update that word in your heart it'll no
[1:32:11] longer just be something you've heard it
[1:32:14] will become a part of you it'll digest
[1:32:16] in your inner being and you'll not walk
[1:32:19] out of here knowing a revelation you'll
[1:32:22] walk out of here being a re
[1:32:24] Revelation a revelation is not just a
[1:32:27] knowledge that we gain a revelation is a
[1:32:30] transformation in who we are a
[1:32:33] revelation will transform us from the
[1:32:37] struggles of leody deia from the battles
[1:32:40] of the pest house from the Mind Battle
[1:32:43] of Satan into a kingdom that says I know
[1:32:48] what the word said and the word is
[1:32:51] talking about me when and you and I can
[1:32:54] get to a place where we realize that
[1:32:58] when we read the book we're reading our
[1:33:01] story we're reading what is sent to us
[1:33:06] it's for us and when we eat that word
[1:33:11] that word becomes a part of who we are
[1:33:14] and then we begin to be like even like
[1:33:16] Christ in the
[1:33:17] sense in the sense that the word was
[1:33:20] fleshing out the word was becoming
[1:33:24] flesh does anybody understand that I
[1:33:27] know you do I know some of you do
[1:33:29] without a
[1:33:32] doubt but it's not just excuse
[1:33:35] me it's not just the portion of
[1:33:40] word that is laid for every age that we
[1:33:45] need he said and there is some anointing
[1:33:50] comes down that projects
[1:33:54] I want you to hear this that projects
[1:33:58] that portion of word for that
[1:34:02] age so the word is laid aside for the
[1:34:06] age but an
[1:34:08] anointing an
[1:34:10] unction remember the anointing makes the
[1:34:14] difference the anointing is what
[1:34:17] searches the message searches the word
[1:34:20] laid aside for this age the anointing is
[1:34:23] it's what searches that word and brings
[1:34:26] out of that laid up stored up food it
[1:34:30] brings it toward us IT projects it in
[1:34:33] our Direction so that we can become
[1:34:35] personally acquainted with it it's more
[1:34:37] than just hearing a tape you can hear
[1:34:39] all the tapes and be blessed and be
[1:34:43] strengthened but when that anointing
[1:34:45] comes and projects a portion of that
[1:34:49] message in your direction all you got to
[1:34:51] do is open your mouth you don't even
[1:34:54] have to chew sometime just open your
[1:34:56] mouth and God will just shove it right
[1:34:58] in but youve in order for that to happen
[1:35:01] you've got to have a a Hungry Heart and
[1:35:04] you've got to have a willing heart and
[1:35:06] you've got to understand that this
[1:35:08] message is not just a sermon preached in
[1:35:11] any church anywhere this word is the
[1:35:14] very thing that's going to cause a bride
[1:35:16] to be
[1:35:17] ready and so outside of this message it
[1:35:22] it's going to be Mighty hard to be
[1:35:24] prepared sir it's going to be Mighty
[1:35:27] hard if if at all possible going to be
[1:35:29] Mighty hard to be prepared now that
[1:35:32] doesn't mean unsaved because we know
[1:35:35] that if you call on the name of the Lord
[1:35:37] whosoever calleth upon the name of the
[1:35:38] Lord is saved but how many of you know
[1:35:41] it's not enough to be a virgin you've
[1:35:43] got to be a virgin that's filled with
[1:35:45] the oil you got to have the oil and that
[1:35:47] oil is not just feeling
[1:35:51] stimulation uh uh you know hair standing
[1:35:53] up Goosebumps and pimples no no no so
[1:35:56] one of the things that that the minister
[1:35:59] was saying is is is we we're not looking
[1:36:02] for a Revival of emotion I I would have
[1:36:05] to say Amen but what we are looking for
[1:36:09] is something that has some emotion in it
[1:36:12] because if it doesn't have emotion in it
[1:36:15] brother brandom said it's graveyard
[1:36:18] dead then then then it's become a grave
[1:36:21] so the emphasis should not be on the
[1:36:24] emotional part of it but you can't take
[1:36:26] a hold of a Livewire come
[1:36:29] on you you you can't put your finger in
[1:36:32] a light socket and not experience
[1:36:35] something
[1:36:37] real
[1:36:39] amen and so there's going to be emotion
[1:36:43] and just because there's emotion doesn't
[1:36:45] mean that that anyone is trying to drag
[1:36:47] you back to denominational Pentecost but
[1:36:50] I'll tell you something if you've never
[1:36:52] had a genuine Pentecostal experience you
[1:36:57] must you've got to so you're not really
[1:36:59] going back to anything you've never had
[1:37:01] one in the beginning you got to go to it
[1:37:05] then you move on and uh so how the gift
[1:37:09] should operate in the church is is
[1:37:12] Sovereign it it is at the the discretion
[1:37:15] of the pastor who the prophet told us
[1:37:18] holds the highest spiritual office in
[1:37:21] the church and uh if he were to be a man
[1:37:25] that he thought he could handle that
[1:37:26] kind of stuff let him do
[1:37:29] it if he can't then then put it in a
[1:37:33] room but don't take it away from the
[1:37:36] people and quote this
[1:37:39] misrepresented idea that that which is
[1:37:42] perfect is come and so nothing else
[1:37:45] matters you see those chapters are not
[1:37:48] just speaking about gifts they're
[1:37:49] speaking about love and by the time you
[1:37:52] get to that verse we're talking about
[1:37:55] perfect love now is the message perfect
[1:37:58] it is until man starts touching
[1:38:03] it so if you could have been there that
[1:38:05] night and it was coming right out of his
[1:38:08] mouth it was as pure as it possibly can
[1:38:13] that was as pure as it possibly could be
[1:38:17] but once man starts putting his hand on
[1:38:20] it taping off the parts he likes
[1:38:24] did you know doctrines were started
[1:38:26] around this message because people would
[1:38:29] take pieces of a
[1:38:30] tape and there were gaps everywhere at
[1:38:33] least now at this point we've got a lot
[1:38:35] of the gaps filled in because there were
[1:38:37] various copies that people found and
[1:38:40] most of those confusions are all taken
[1:38:42] care of but you get editors involved and
[1:38:45] somebody emphasizing how many times he
[1:38:48] knocked on the pull pit like what a what
[1:38:50] in the world does that matter come on
[1:38:52] now you know or our brother randam
[1:38:55] cleared his
[1:38:56] throat I don't think he was sending
[1:38:59] hidden signals to the
[1:39:01] bride I think he was excited about the
[1:39:04] word that was coming forth and he got
[1:39:07] caught up even like he did the night
[1:39:10] that he climbed up on top of the pull
[1:39:12] pit and swung his legs over on the front
[1:39:15] side and began to rock him back and
[1:39:17] forth that is quite emotional
[1:39:26] somebody said well you know we got the
[1:39:29] tape where he said he was out in the
[1:39:30] woods he ran around a tree they said
[1:39:31] yeah but that wasn't in church well the
[1:39:34] pull pit was in
[1:39:36] church and you know they used to say
[1:39:39] Brother Cleveland used to tell me he
[1:39:40] said I'd just love to be in in the
[1:39:42] Tabernacle and testimonies would go
[1:39:44] forth and brother Brandon would slip in
[1:39:46] and he would Rejoice with those
[1:39:49] testimonies he would get so excited
[1:39:52] hearing people tell what God had done in
[1:39:54] their life and so you there can be order
[1:39:58] in something without taking the life
[1:40:01] away our young people need to be able to
[1:40:04] experience the I hope to see every one
[1:40:08] of these young people so filled with the
[1:40:11] Holy Ghost staggering around like drunk
[1:40:14] men babbling in other
[1:40:18] tongues I look for
[1:40:21] that there's a Time time and a place a
[1:40:25] and a moment for such things as that
[1:40:29] when the preaching is going forth that's
[1:40:31] not the time for tongues interpretations
[1:40:34] or or intercessions like that but
[1:40:37] there's times and places and uh you know
[1:40:41] I'm thankful I'm thankful uh that there
[1:40:44] are those who have come to understand
[1:40:47] that God still speaks and here's how he
[1:40:49] does it he does it by the anointing he
[1:40:51] takes the portion of word lay made up
[1:40:53] for every age then an anointing comes
[1:40:56] down and takes that portion and projects
[1:41:00] that word for that age to whoever needs
[1:41:04] to get a hold of it I don't know about
[1:41:06] you I'm not ashamed to say I'm very
[1:41:08] thankful and humble to say that I'm glad
[1:41:10] the anointing projected the word in my
[1:41:13] direction he said and you see where
[1:41:15] we're at today read what we're supposed
[1:41:17] to be doing then you'll know how far we
[1:41:20] are I'm thankful that I know how far we
[1:41:24] are I I can only see one thing left the
[1:41:27] coming of the Lord
[1:41:31] Jesus at any time a
[1:41:36] Rapture

[1:41:41] meet
[1:41:42] him in the air now these things has got
[1:41:46] to come to pass in this day just as he
[1:41:50] promised he would do it and we know
[1:41:53] we know beyond the shadow of a doubt
[1:41:56] that these things are on the horizon it
[1:41:59] doesn't matter what kind of church you
[1:42:00] go to people who have any kind of real
[1:42:04] connection with an experience in Christ
[1:42:07] are are saying well watching the news

[1:44:02] have some stuff on our neck our neck's
[1:44:04] not fat enough we got to get that thing
[1:44:07] broke off it's coming it's coming it's
[1:44:11] coming it's
[1:44:13] coming well I want to go back just a
[1:44:15] moment and and and pick this up because
[1:44:19] uh and I'll be mindful of the time but
[1:44:21] when we were together last we went to
[1:44:22] number and we talked about a this red
[1:44:25] heer upon which had never come a yoke
[1:44:27] and there was no blemish and we read two
[1:44:30] portions of quotations where brother an
[1:44:32] was talking about it and in one of those
[1:44:35] he talked about uh looking at a red
[1:44:37] object through red red through red
[1:44:39] doesn't look red red through red looks
[1:44:42] white and in scriptural signs of the
[1:44:45] time Birmingham Alabama this is what I
[1:44:48] want to remind you of but remember the
[1:44:51] bride will be a called out separated and
[1:44:54] different filled Holy Ghost born washed
[1:44:57] in the blood of the Lamb she'll abstain
[1:45:02] from thank you for helping me you're
[1:45:04] doing so good everything that's filthy
[1:45:07] around her husband that don't mean
[1:45:09] she'll sneak around behind her husband's
[1:45:13] back she's not this bride is not a
[1:45:16] flucy she's not sneaking around behind
[1:45:18] her husband's back she doesn't want to
[1:45:20] carry anything she doesn't want to bring
[1:45:23] anything into the presence of her
[1:45:25] husband because she knows he is
[1:45:27] altogether lovely and pure she is a
[1:45:29] Chase virgin pure by the word how is She
[1:45:32] chased wasn't she touched by
[1:45:34] denominational hands she was wasn't she
[1:45:37] ravished by preachers she was didn't the
[1:45:40] systems of church anity abuse her they
[1:45:43] did come on now was she completely pure
[1:45:46] when she heard the word she was
[1:45:49] not she was contaminated
[1:45:53] but there is a glorious glorious thing
[1:45:58] that happens when this word comes to
[1:46:00] you it not only rolls off the ugliness
[1:46:04] of yesterday but it restores you to
[1:46:07] [Applause]
[1:46:11] virginity you know in certain cultures
[1:46:14] women have come to uh have
[1:46:18] surgery there is a surgical procedure
[1:46:21] that uh is require ired In some cultures
[1:46:25] to restore a woman's membrane to her to
[1:46:29] her physical point of being a virgin but
[1:46:32] that didn't change that didn't change
[1:46:33] her
[1:46:36] emotions she may she may be physically
[1:46:40] put back in order but she's already lost
[1:46:43] something
[1:46:45] emotionally anybody with me she's
[1:46:49] already given up something emotionally
[1:46:53] mentally that she'll never be able to
[1:46:55] get back from a natural restoration of a
[1:46:59] surgery I hope that's not too to uh to
[1:47:02] plain it's actually quite interesting to
[1:47:05] me and uh because remember that the sign
[1:47:09] that that a man and a woman have been
[1:47:11] together is a blood token it's a blood
[1:47:14] sign and uh that that had to be
[1:47:17] preserved throughout the
[1:47:20] marriage and because if that man ever
[1:47:23] grew tired of that wife and he said I
[1:47:25] just want to put her away and and he
[1:47:26] said why would you want to put her away
[1:47:28] well she wasn't really a virgin to begin
[1:47:30] with they say oh wait a minute you don't
[1:47:32] did you forget we have the token we kept
[1:47:36] the bed sheet I'm sorry if that sounds
[1:47:38] too plain uh but it is it is a reality
[1:47:42] we kept the token of The Virginity and
[1:47:44] we're back well I want you to know
[1:47:46] there's something about this
[1:47:47] word that spiritually takes us those who
[1:47:52] have been touched
[1:47:53] those who have been
[1:47:57] manhandled by the
[1:47:59] church because we were on a
[1:48:03] journey and uh I had all kinds of
[1:48:05] responses the next day or two after the
[1:48:07] sermon Sunday several people I mean
[1:48:10] eight or 10 people texted they said I
[1:48:11] don't think I completely understood the
[1:48:13] question so they begin to tell me their
[1:48:15] Journey well first I was in the
[1:48:16] Methodist then I was in the Baptist and
[1:48:18] then I and you know the list got longer
[1:48:20] and longer and longer and you may regret
[1:48:22] that don't regret
[1:48:24] that that's part of your
[1:48:26] pedigree that's part of who why you're
[1:48:29] where you are
[1:48:30] today what I love about it is you didn't
[1:48:33] settle down somewhere and stay in a
[1:48:36] portion of Truth and a portion of error
[1:48:39] but you said I'll just take the truth of
[1:48:41] justification and go on and I'll take
[1:48:44] the truth of sanctification and go on
[1:48:46] and I'll take the truth of a Pentecostal
[1:48:48] blessing and go on until the fullness of
[1:48:52] the word comes but I want you to know we
[1:48:55] understand
[1:48:56] emotionally every one of those stops
[1:48:59] sister took something out of us we lost
[1:49:03] friends we we we were hurt we were
[1:49:07] wounded some of us got the right boot
[1:49:11] you still here the right boot of
[1:49:15] Fellowship didn't feel too
[1:49:18] good they didn't know they they thought
[1:49:20] they were really you know straightening
[1:49:21] us out
[1:49:24] woo we ought to go back and kiss him
[1:49:27] now thank you for kicking me out of your
[1:49:31] Lodge I didn't belong there
[1:49:35] anyhow I was on my way to the perfect
[1:49:39] word every bit of that took something
[1:49:41] out of us emotionally then we come to
[1:49:43] the pure word and here is what God says
[1:49:46] about the bride that receives his word
[1:49:48] she is a chased virgin pure by the word
[1:49:53] no matter no matter that she's been
[1:49:55] manhandled no matter that she's been
[1:49:57] ravished no matter that she took a a
[1:50:00] portion of God and a portion of Doctrine
[1:50:02] a man's Creed now the word and her are
[1:50:07] the same are the
[1:50:09] same you are now Justified and you stand
[1:50:12] here today pure untouched a Virgin by
[1:50:17] the word because you have become one
[1:50:20] with that word and as a man in his wife
[1:50:22] wife becomes one uh I I'm just just
[1:50:26] wondering just just wondering if you're
[1:50:28] hearing me as a man and his wife become
[1:50:31] one in Union so does the real genuine
[1:50:36] Church of
[1:50:38] God
[1:50:40] untouched
[1:50:41] pure you're not an adulteress you're not
[1:50:45] a
[1:50:46] fornicator the word has purified you and
[1:50:49] cleaned you when he becomes in Christ
[1:50:53] he the Bible is punctuated with an amen
[1:50:56] every promise don't make any difference
[1:50:59] what the denomination says the soul
[1:51:01] that's in The Believer mind will and
[1:51:03] emotion punctuate it because it is the
[1:51:06] word of
[1:51:07] God it is the word in him speaking out
[1:51:13] do do you follow me the revelation of
[1:51:16] Jesus Christ he said that's like the
[1:51:18] Virgin the word virgin means pure holy
[1:51:21] unad
[1:51:23] alterated and Sanctified things that are
[1:51:27] to
[1:51:28] be let's go all the way down to toward
[1:51:31] the end it's a perfect place calling you
[1:51:34] to that Perfection and you have to be
[1:51:37] perfect to get there that's exactly
[1:51:39] right but you've got the word to do that
[1:51:41] for you the Bible said so Jesus said be
[1:51:43] therefore perfect I want to skip on the
[1:51:46] word of God bleeding
[1:51:49] blood to wash the bride in
[1:51:53] yes sir she stands perfect F so it
[1:51:57] doesn't matter want to make sure we're
[1:51:59] clear cuz we're moving on for this
[1:52:01] doesn't matter about your Baptist
[1:52:03] doesn't matter about your method doesn't
[1:52:04] matter about your family church doesn't
[1:52:05] matter nothing matters though though the
[1:52:09] the word has bled for you she stands
[1:52:13] perfect virgin unadulterated and then
[1:52:16] I'd like for you all to read
[1:52:21] that I don't think we believe
[1:52:25] that we we must believe it it is the
[1:52:29] truth it is the truth in John chap 7
[1:52:34] verse
[1:52:35] 37-39 in the last day that great day of
[1:52:39] the feast this is at the end of of seot
[1:52:43] it's at the end of Tabernacles Jesus
[1:52:45] stood and cried saying if any man thirst
[1:52:48] let him come unto me and drink he that
[1:52:52] believe believeth on me as the scripture
[1:52:54] has said out
[1:53:00] of you've got a river in your
[1:53:04] belly you don't have to go find the
[1:53:06] river you are the source of the river
[1:53:09] you're the mouth of the river you're the
[1:53:12] origin of the river you've got a river
[1:53:15] in your belly Jesus said if you believe
[1:53:17] on me out of his belly shall flow Rivers
[1:53:23] come on rivers of Living Water if you
[1:53:26] don't think he's talking about the
[1:53:28] spirit read the next verse but this
[1:53:31] spake he
[1:53:32] of the logos the spirit the anointing
[1:53:36] the pillar of fire the manifested
[1:53:39] presence of
[1:53:42] God the one who overshadowed
[1:53:45] Mary sir this same
[1:53:48] Jesus same one same spirit with which
[1:53:52] they that believe on him should receive
[1:53:54] for the Holy Ghost was not yet given
[1:53:56] because Jesus was not yet glorified but
[1:53:59] it was never to be another Holy
[1:54:02] Ghost it was always to be the very same
[1:54:07] Holy Ghost are you still there first
[1:54:09] John here let's let's move to this
[1:54:12] before we before we uh oh no it's one oh
[1:54:17] No 1 John 2:
[1:54:20] 18-20 little children children it is the
[1:54:23] last time and as ye have heard that
[1:54:26] Antichrist shall come even now are there
[1:54:29] many Antichrist whereby we know that it
[1:54:33] is the last time we have learned about
[1:54:38] that suffix uh prefix excuse me we have
[1:54:42] learned about that prefix there that
[1:54:44] that Greek portion anti we look at that
[1:54:49] and we think it always means against
[1:54:52] anti-slavery means against slavery and
[1:54:56] anti-slavery indeed does mean that but
[1:54:59] not every time we see that anti as a
[1:55:01] prefix before a word does it mean
[1:55:03] against in fact when we are looking at
[1:55:06] the word Antichrist we're not looking at
[1:55:09] at a false Christ in the sense that
[1:55:12] we're looking at the presentation of
[1:55:15] another Christ not one who comes to
[1:55:17] present himself as against Christ but
[1:55:21] one who comes to present himself as
[1:55:24] another Christ so it is against Christ
[1:55:28] no doubt about it but he doesn't come
[1:55:30] telling you that he doesn't come
[1:55:32] preaching that Christ is error he comes
[1:55:35] presenting himself as though he were the
[1:55:38] Christ little little children Antichrist
[1:55:42] are
[1:55:43] here and because of that we know that we
[1:55:47] are living in the last time let's get
[1:55:49] the next verse
[1:55:54] they went out from
[1:55:56] us but they were never they were not of
[1:56:00] us for if they had been of us they would
[1:56:04] no doubt have continued with us but they
[1:56:06] went out that they might be made
[1:56:09] manifest that they were not all of us
[1:56:13] now look at verse 20 but ye have an
[1:56:22] what do you think that unction
[1:56:27] is it's the
[1:56:29] anointing it's the
[1:56:31] logos it's the pillar of
[1:56:34] fire it's the same
[1:56:36] spirit it's what makes the
[1:56:39] difference the reason why you can hang
[1:56:42] on to the word is because you've got
[1:56:44] something in you hanging on to the
[1:56:50] word it's not you doing that something
[1:56:54] in you holding on to the word but
[1:56:59] ye excuse
[1:57:03] me but ye have an unction from the Holy
[1:57:08] One and she
[1:57:12] what how is it
[1:57:14] possible because he lives in us he who
[1:57:18] is omniscient
[1:57:20] [Music]
[1:57:22] doesn't mean that our mind knows
[1:57:25] everything what it means is the source
[1:57:28] of everything that we need to
[1:57:30] know sir is living in US sir right
[1:57:38] now give me just a minute Benjamin would
[1:57:40] you get me a
[1:57:42] rag something is closing me
[1:57:47] up isn't he good
[1:57:57] nobody's picking up any smoke or
[1:57:59] anything smell are
[1:58:13] you in my
[1:58:15] briefcase all right let's go
[1:58:18] on in the message what was the Holy
[1:58:21] Ghost given for
[1:58:23] paragraph
[1:58:25] 112 it talks to us about the
[1:58:30] unction he said it's to give unction to
[1:58:34] the
[1:58:35] preacher it's to
[1:58:38] give
[1:58:41] Holiness to the
[1:58:43] group it's to set the church in order
[1:58:49] was in my in my backpack
[1:58:53] to set the church in
[1:58:56] order it's to bring a Unity of
[1:59:01] spirit all of this is what the unction
[1:59:04] does gives anointing and unction to the
[1:59:07] preacher it gives Holiness to the group
[1:59:11] because we can't earn that we can't
[1:59:14] manufacture that thank
[1:59:19] you it can't be manufactured
[1:59:24] he represents it to
[1:59:29] us it brings Holiness to the group it's
[1:59:33] to set the church in order it's to bring
[1:59:37] a Unity of spirit it's to unite us
[1:59:41] together with power power it's to unite
[1:59:45] us together with with love with
[1:59:48] brotherly love what would anybody want
[1:59:50] to do without the unction
[1:59:53] it sounds to me like if the unction is
[1:59:55] missing we're missing a whole lot of
[1:59:57] what we have to have so the the the
[2:00:01] anointing the unction makes the
[2:00:04] difference we're still talking about
[2:00:06] climbing
[2:00:07] mountains we're still talking about
[2:00:09] mountain climbing and we are not going
[2:00:12] to climb any higher without any of these
[2:00:14] different aspects that the spirit of God
[2:00:16] has highlighted but we're sure not going
[2:00:18] to go any higher without that anointing
[2:00:20] to do these things that the prophet has
[2:00:22] told us he said I don't care if you're
[2:00:25] Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran
[2:00:27] whatever you are if we've all been uh if
[2:00:29] we've all been by one Holy Spirit
[2:00:32] baptized into one body and become
[2:00:34] members of the body of Jesus Christ
[2:00:37] there's there's nothing present nothing
[2:00:39] future hunger starvation nothing can
[2:00:42] separate us from the love of God the
[2:00:44] love of Christ the love of God that's in
[2:00:47] Christ because we are born of his Spirit
[2:00:51] come on
[2:00:52] washed in his blood we are
[2:00:56] a that's what God came to do that's what
[2:01:00] the holy spirit is for yes sir that's
[2:01:04] right now verse 20 in the Amplified for
[2:01:08] a
[2:01:08] moment but you have been
[2:01:12] anointed
[2:01:14] by but you have been anointed by you
[2:01:18] hold a sacred appointment from
[2:01:22] you have been given an unction from the
[2:01:27] Holy
[2:01:28] One and you know the truth or you know
[2:01:33] all things because you know the truth
[2:01:39] that word unction I'm not sure if you
[2:01:41] have that or not but that word
[2:01:45] unction the translation of that it's
[2:01:48] it's the word charisma
[2:01:52] it's the anointing it's a very same it's
[2:01:54] very same word
[2:01:56] 5545 an anointing unction it means the
[2:02:00] applying or smearing of
[2:02:04] anointment in the reception of spiritual
[2:02:08] privileges a supernatural sanction
[2:02:12] blessing and endowment oh my oh my did
[2:02:17] you know you have a supernatural
[2:02:19] sanction did you know you've received
[2:02:22] spiritual privileges hello I'm asking
[2:02:25] you a question did you know you've
[2:02:27] received spiritual privileges did you
[2:02:29] know you've received a supernatural
[2:02:31] sanction and a blessing and an
[2:02:34] endowment from on high Hallelujah and
[2:02:37] where did that come from where did
[2:02:39] Charisma come from Charisma comes from
[2:02:42] Christos amen and Christos is
[2:02:46] messia Christos is the anointed one
[2:02:50] Christos is the messiah
[2:02:52] and you have received something
[2:02:54] something from him has been smeared on
[2:02:59] you hello yes sir I mean this is the
[2:03:02] literal literal translation of this
[2:03:04] phrase not only in the New Testament
[2:03:06] like we have here but also in the Old
[2:03:08] Testament when you think about an
[2:03:10] anointing you know they don't anoint
[2:03:12] they didn't anoint in the Bible like we
[2:03:13] anoint
[2:03:16] today you say oh no I know that they
[2:03:18] took off the Ram's Horn filled it up
[2:03:20] with oil and and poured the whole thing
[2:03:21] out that wasn't all they
[2:03:23] did no no no no no no no yeah they
[2:03:26] poured it right over the top of the
[2:03:30] head they emptied out the horn right on
[2:03:33] top of their head and then the priest
[2:03:36] would take his
[2:03:41] hands and smear that
[2:03:46] oil cuz it's not something dropping on
[2:03:50] you it's just like brother brandom
[2:03:52] teaches us about the baptism of the Holy
[2:03:54] Ghost you can get that Holy Ghost on
[2:03:55] your
[2:03:56] flesh and die and go to
[2:03:59] hell
[2:04:01] right you can talk in tongues and die
[2:04:03] and go to hell and it be the Holy Ghost
[2:04:05] doing it it's not just getting that on
[2:04:09] you that's going to make you have that
[2:04:11] full Born Again experience it's when
[2:04:13] that anointing when that when that
[2:04:15] Crystal it's when that chisma is rubbed
[2:04:18] in yes when it penetrates the mind and
[2:04:20] the will and the emotions it gets deeper
[2:04:22] than that and it goes into the very
[2:04:24] essence of who you
[2:04:25] are I know most of the preachers preach
[2:04:28] that the inside of the inside is the
[2:04:31] soul but the very meaning of the word
[2:04:33] soul is mind will and emotion and so we
[2:04:36] know that that is not the better
[2:04:37] description of the of the very essence
[2:04:39] of who you are when Adam became a living
[2:04:43] Soul it was because something
[2:04:45] Divine a portion of divinity was added
[2:04:48] to his body that was dead and lifeless
[2:04:51] and God breathed breath into the
[2:04:53] nostrils of man and Man became a dead
[2:04:56] body became what a living soul and mind
[2:05:00] will and emotions connected that man to
[2:05:03] his physical environment but his but his
[2:05:05] mind will and emotions is not what what
[2:05:07] he got in the Divine
[2:05:09] exchange it was the essence of God it
[2:05:12] was the very Breath of God can you
[2:05:14] imagine God coming and breathing his
[2:05:17] breath into you well you better be able
[2:05:20] to imagine it because that's what
[2:05:21] supposedly happened to you when you
[2:05:23] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:05:25] you got hooked up to to resuscitation
[2:05:28] from the Divine and he filled up your
[2:05:31] inner being with the very Breath of God
[2:05:33] and I want you to know when that happens
[2:05:35] you you can't be the
[2:05:39] same so your trouble doesn't come from
[2:05:41] that Divine Essence your trouble comes
[2:05:44] from that which is in between cuz the
[2:05:47] mind go everywhere the mind has a
[2:05:50] tendency to pull toward the flesh
[2:05:52] the mind has a tendency to pull toward
[2:05:54] the solish
[2:05:56] realm always self self selfish realm And
[2:06:02] the emotions has more of a tendency to
[2:06:05] roll toward the
[2:06:08] flesh then it will to the very essence
[2:06:10] of who you are that God life that is
[2:06:13] within you if we can ever get our
[2:06:14] emotions connected to the god life
[2:06:17] that's within us yes we'll have full
[2:06:21] control of who we
[2:06:23] are no more flying off the handle I'm
[2:06:26] going to slow down here
[2:06:33] now no more flying off the
[2:06:36] handle no more getting all
[2:06:40] upset needing a shot calm us down
[2:06:44] straight jacket come on we just say
[2:06:48] okay I've got to pull this back
[2:06:52] this is not who I am the word says who I
[2:06:55] am I I I can't let this rip me
[2:06:59] apart I can't let this diagnosis move me
[2:07:02] out of
[2:07:03] Faith how many of you have ever
[2:07:05] exercised that at a at a critical hour
[2:07:07] in your life let me see your hand when
[2:07:09] you felt like you were going to panic
[2:07:10] and and go over the edge and somehow by
[2:07:13] the grace of God you exercise the truth
[2:07:15] that had been presented to you and it
[2:07:19] worked can you imagine that it actually
[2:07:23] worked and it will
[2:07:25] work so if you look at this uh reception
[2:07:29] of spiritual privileges a supernatural
[2:07:32] sanction blessing and endowment if you
[2:07:34] were to take a look at the Jewish uh the
[2:07:38] the the Jewish New Testament commentary
[2:07:42] and that that comes from Dr David
[2:07:44] Stern in the commentary of that verse he
[2:07:48] says it could easily read you you have
[2:07:53] received the messiah's anointing
[2:07:57] am it goes on to say this you have an
[2:08:02] anointing but because of the context
[2:08:05] this could be
[2:08:07] rendered you have been
[2:08:16] messiah messiah
[2:08:21] given a
[2:08:22] place in
[2:08:26] Messiah that's good just think I will
[2:08:29] tell you now that's very
[2:08:32] good somebody in this house has been
[2:08:37] Messiah it's time for us to live like
[2:08:39] that cuz we've received an
[2:08:42] unction from
[2:08:45] Messiah and that has
[2:08:47] Messiah
[2:08:49] Us in first John John 2:27 and
[2:08:55] 29 it's made very plain he said but the
[2:08:59] anointing which ye have received of
[2:09:02] him what's the
[2:09:04] word abideth in
[2:09:07] you and ye need not let any man teach
[2:09:12] you but as the same anointing teacheth
[2:09:15] you of all things and is truth and is no
[2:09:20] lie and even as it hath taught you ye
[2:09:24] shall you see here's the difference
[2:09:27] we're not getting under a Revival
[2:09:30] atmosphere and dying the next
[2:09:33] week we're receiving a portion that will
[2:09:36] sustain us because it's not a visiting
[2:09:41] anointing it's not a day of Visitation
[2:09:44] Church it's a day of
[2:09:46] habitation it's not a visiting anointing
[2:09:48] but it's an abiding anointing it's one
[2:09:50] that comes stays in us and teaches us
[2:09:53] all things and reveals what truth is and
[2:09:56] exposes the lie and screams at us about
[2:09:59] the error in our own life and even as it
[2:10:03] hath taught you ye shall abide in him
[2:10:05] boy it's like
[2:10:06] glue everybody look this
[2:10:09] way it's like glue yes sir it glues you
[2:10:13] into
[2:10:15] Christ and Christ into
[2:10:18] youall boy that's that's pretty good
[2:10:21] news
[2:10:21] news and now little children abide in
[2:10:24] him that when he shall appear we may
[2:10:28] have confidence and not be ashamed
[2:10:31] before him at his coming if ye know that
[2:10:36] he is
[2:10:38] righteous ye know that everyone that
[2:10:41] doeth righteousness is born of
[2:10:47] him in questions and answers
[2:10:51] paragraph
[2:10:53] 107 he said now that Pillar of Fire is
[2:10:56] the logos that went out of God remember
[2:10:59] that the logos which is actually the
[2:11:02] attribute of the fullness of
[2:11:05] God when God uh become into a form to
[2:11:10] where it could be
[2:11:12] seen it was the anointing of the great
[2:11:15] spirit that went
[2:11:19] forth It's
[2:11:22] condescending it's coming down God the
[2:11:24] Father the logos that was way up over
[2:11:27] Israel he was holy he could not bear sin
[2:11:30] there had to be a blood offering right
[2:11:32] in
[2:11:34] Eden then the logos become flesh and
[2:11:38] dwelt Among Us and where this Loos dwelt
[2:11:42] in human body which was the sacrifice
[2:11:46] Jesus
[2:11:47] Jesus when man was made in the image of
[2:11:50] God and and then God gave town in the
[2:11:52] image of man to redeem man that brought
[2:11:55] man oh my
[2:11:57] hallelujah
[2:12:00] hallelujah I know this isn't new
[2:12:03] material but this is oh folks this is
[2:12:06] what sets this message
[2:12:10] apart I just recently come to understand
[2:12:13] that there's a there's another division
[2:12:16] out
[2:12:18] there it's taking really taking the
[2:12:21] people back to
[2:12:24] Tunis in such a way as to say
[2:12:28] that Christ was not Divine until his
[2:12:35] baptism to see something like that is is
[2:12:39] is so is so close it's just a one one
[2:12:44] millimeter above
[2:12:47] trinitarianism we know it's not right
[2:12:50] that is is not right Mary the body of
[2:12:54] Mary didn't even
[2:12:56] create the
[2:13:02] egg if if Mary through through the
[2:13:06] process of
[2:13:07] ulation would have created the egg and
[2:13:10] the spirit would have fell on an Earthly
[2:13:13] egg I don't know what that egg would
[2:13:15] have
[2:13:16] been I'm not smart enough to tell you
[2:13:19] what the results of that would have been
[2:13:21] but I know that's not what he said
[2:13:23] happen he said that God
[2:13:27] planted he placed that
[2:13:30] egg sir so am I to think it was just a
[2:13:33] ordinary egg like any woman in the town
[2:13:35] would have produced no no it was a
[2:13:38] Divine
[2:13:39] egg overshadowed by a Divine
[2:13:46] Sperma so it was a god body a body given
[2:13:50] by God
[2:13:51] fertilized by
[2:13:54] God it's for us then to say that he was
[2:13:59] not Divine until the Holy Ghost fell on
[2:14:02] him in the Jordan River there is a very
[2:14:06] significant thing that took place that
[2:14:08] day it was the beginning of the
[2:14:11] adoption and though he were a son he had
[2:14:14] to have the same adoption process you do
[2:14:16] the Bible said so he had to learn
[2:14:18] through obedience
[2:14:21] and so he had to have a beginning of an
[2:14:23] adoption and an ending of an adoption
[2:14:25] and on the Mount of transfiguration the
[2:14:28] adoption ended and the voice said not
[2:14:31] just this is my son I'm going to dwell
[2:14:33] in him but the voice said hear
[2:14:37] him because when you've heard him you've
[2:14:40] heard
[2:14:41] me that's an adoption that's entirely
[2:14:44] different but the body that he
[2:14:47] had and and and to to to be so confused
[2:14:50] after all of these years uh because
[2:14:53] people get weary of preaching the same
[2:14:58] message they get tired of preaching this
[2:15:01] same message since the way back in the
[2:15:03] 50s and so they they must have to find
[2:15:05] some creative way to make it more
[2:15:08] juicy it don't get any juicier than this
[2:15:11] right here when a man made in the image
[2:15:15] of God and then God came down in the
[2:15:16] image of man to redeem man that brought
[2:15:19] man and God together heaven and Earth
[2:15:21] hugged and kissed each other God and man
[2:15:23] embraced each other as fatherhood and
[2:15:26] sunship when the logos became flesh and
[2:15:29] dwelt Among Us oh that's good enough for
[2:15:31] me Jesus said I came from God and I go
[2:15:34] to God is that right after his death
[2:15:36] burial resurrection and Ascension where
[2:15:38] the body was taken up to set at the
[2:15:39] right hand of God he said now I don't
[2:15:41] mean God's got a right hand God's a
[2:15:43] spirit and he goes on to explain to us
[2:15:45] in a beautiful way but at the right hand
[2:15:47] means in power and authority of God that
[2:15:49] in the name that in that name that in
[2:15:51] that name everything in heaven is named
[2:15:53] after and subject to it everything in
[2:15:55] Earth is named after it and subject to
[2:15:57] it oh my oh
[2:15:59] my I just want to speak the name of
[2:16:03] Jesus do you understand when you speak
[2:16:06] that name you're speaking the name that
[2:16:09] everything in heaven is named after and
[2:16:11] everything on Earth has to carry that
[2:16:14] name a name above all names sir Jesus
[2:16:19] Christ now this Loos that was in him
[2:16:22] we're we're closing
[2:16:24] sometime now this Loos that was in him I
[2:16:28] I mean there's some folks don't seem to
[2:16:30] have even made their way in here to
[2:16:31] church yet I was kind of preaching till
[2:16:33] everybody got here now this Loos that
[2:16:36] was in him which was the spirit of God
[2:16:40] the anointing through the sanctifying
[2:16:43] grace of the blood brought many
[2:16:53] sir David did I hear you then
[2:16:58] good many sons to
[2:17:02] God which is Anointed with some some
[2:17:07] diluted version
[2:17:10] or you know watered down or a little
[2:17:13] little more alcohol added or little more
[2:17:16] water no
[2:17:18] same same
[2:17:23] same many sons which is Anointed with
[2:17:28] this same
[2:17:30] logos I want to do one more with you and
[2:17:34] that is the unveiling of
[2:17:38] God paragraph 186 the anointing is a
[2:17:44] person I I I don't want you to see a
[2:17:48] ghost I I don't want you to think that
[2:17:51] that it's a
[2:17:52] mist or a cloud or some sort of
[2:17:56] ethereal
[2:17:58] movement the anointing is a
[2:18:02] person the word Christ means an anointed
[2:18:05] one then Moses was then Moses was Christ
[2:18:09] in his day he was the anointed one that
[2:18:14] is absolutely the
[2:18:18] truth to worship Moses would have been
[2:18:24] wrong to worship brother brandham is
[2:18:28] wrong to worship a pastor is wrong but
[2:18:32] to say that Moses was Christ in his day
[2:18:36] is exactly right because it means the
[2:18:39] anointed one Moses had the message for
[2:18:42] that
[2:18:42] hour it's exactly right to say it that
[2:18:45] way then Moses was Christ in his days he
[2:18:48] was the anointed one Jeremiah was Christ
[2:18:51] in his days with a
[2:18:55] portion for the word of the word for
[2:18:59] that day sir but when Jesus
[2:19:02] came he was higher than Moses wasn't he
[2:19:05] higher than Jeremiah higher than Elijah
[2:19:07] when Jesus came he became he came as the
[2:19:11] Redeemer the anointed one and that was
[2:19:14] both Moses and all that was in Moses all
[2:19:16] the word and all the godhead bodily
[2:19:18] Hallelujah was in him
[2:19:21] that's the reason the whole temple veil
[2:19:23] rent The Mercy Seat come in perfect view
[2:19:25] Plain View he
[2:19:28] was the anointed one thank you all for
[2:19:31] being with me he said now notice now the
[2:19:34] veil in human flesh the promise word to
[2:19:37] this age must also be veiled notice sin
[2:19:39] loving church members and
[2:19:42] sinners cannot see
[2:19:46] it listen
[2:19:49] listen because of the human
[2:19:52] Veil it's going to take a mighty move of
[2:19:55] God's power yes sir for you to be able
[2:19:58] to see Christ in
[2:20:00] me and for me to be able to see Christ
[2:20:03] in
[2:20:06] you and we're going to see
[2:20:08] it we're going to see it we're going to
[2:20:11] recognize it it's going to set set
[2:20:14] things in
[2:20:16] motion it'll eventually cause the
[2:20:18] molecules of your body to vibrate on
[2:20:20] higher level than they've ever vibrated
[2:20:22] on before and sickness and disease will
[2:20:25] have to start fleeing your body
[2:20:27] immediately amen has to go has to leave
[2:20:30] you it can't live in that place where
[2:20:32] those molecules become charged with the
[2:20:35] very fullness of who God is then
[2:20:37] sickness starts moving old age starts
[2:20:39] having to go away come on and the next
[2:20:42] thing you know a body changes upon
[2:20:46] you is that really it yeah that's it
[2:20:52] we we just we see each other's crooked
[2:20:59] noses one of these
[2:21:04] days that's the reason they couldn't see
[2:21:06] him he's a man where did he come from
[2:21:09] what Fellowship card does he have what
[2:21:11] church does he belong to I want to speak
[2:21:14] on that tonight what church does he
[2:21:15] belong to
[2:21:16] see H what church does he belong to what
[2:21:19] group what school did he have where did
[2:21:21] he get his education well this man was
[2:21:23] born according to the tradition or
[2:21:25] according to the legend of him around
[2:21:26] here the man was born out of holy
[2:21:28] wedlock why sure he's of the devil then
[2:21:31] he's of the devil born out of holy
[2:21:33] wedlock Joseph just married her to keep
[2:21:34] her from being
[2:21:36] stoned cuz she was an adulterous and the
[2:21:38] man came around and tell us priests what
[2:21:41] to do and there was God standing there
[2:21:45] mocked and ridiculed and misunderstood
[2:21:47] and lied about God was standing there
[2:21:50] revealing in that word and all they
[2:21:52] could see was the
[2:21:53] [Music]
[2:21:55] rumors all they could see was their
[2:21:57] understanding of
[2:21:59] it my God why H has Thou forsaken me the
[2:22:02] very song they were singing in the
[2:22:04] temple that David had made them for
[2:22:06] years ago pertaining to Christ all bones
[2:22:09] all my bones to stare at me they pierced
[2:22:12] my hands my feet there they he was there
[2:22:15] they was standing there singing that the
[2:22:17] very man dying on the cross and when
[2:22:19] they got through
[2:22:22] when he died the god of Heaven come down
[2:22:24] like he did on Mount sini with Holy Fire
[2:22:27] burnt the temple veil top to bottom tore
[2:22:29] it apart and what could they do look
[2:22:31] right there out of the temple window on
[2:22:43] Calvary there are there are
[2:22:46] archaeologists who
[2:22:49] believe that
[2:22:51] the real
[2:22:53] Calvary is the same place across the
[2:22:56] valley where the red heer was offered
[2:23:00] and if that is indeed the
[2:23:04] case remember we just have the words we
[2:23:07] just have the words of folks Through the
[2:23:09] Ages that that Gordon's Calvary is
[2:23:12] Calvary but archaeologist believe that
[2:23:15] if if this Christ really was to fulfill
[2:23:18] this whole thing he would have had to
[2:23:20] die on the Mount of Olives directly
[2:23:22] across the Valley from the temple and
[2:23:25] remember the
[2:23:30] bridge let me see if I
[2:23:37] could just another minute It's 121
[2:23:39] that's good we got
[2:23:41] time thank you thank
[2:23:44] you
[2:23:46] goodness if I could show you this I
[2:23:48] think you'd enjoy seeing it
[2:24:02] in the Lord
[2:24:04] good yeah yeah
[2:24:08] yeah charity it's coming to
[2:24:11] you in a in a text I know that makes it
[2:24:14] harder but just let me do that
[2:24:16] cuz everybody's waiting on me I think we
[2:24:19] showed this not too long
[2:24:44] ago come through
[2:24:51] can we can you look
[2:24:53] across the valley here where where this
[2:24:57] altar is see the red
[2:25:00] heer look across the valley there and
[2:25:02] see this bridge that's been built all
[2:25:05] the way down into the valley to make it
[2:25:07] and and look it's it's in direct
[2:25:10] alignment with the with the door going
[2:25:13] into the temple which is in direct
[2:25:15] alignment with the veil going into the
[2:25:17] holy of holies
[2:25:20] so this is just one rendition this is
[2:25:22] the most most authentic Orthodox
[2:25:26] rendition of how the red heer would have
[2:25:30] been offered directly across as long as
[2:25:34] the ramp stood there the priest would
[2:25:36] then slay and take the blood all the way
[2:25:39] back across if if that is if if there's
[2:25:43] any truth to that we don't know then
[2:25:45] Christ could have likely have died there
[2:25:48] near that same spot
[2:25:51] and if he did then it's the only
[2:25:54] explanation because we know for sure
[2:25:58] that from the position of Gordon's
[2:26:02] Calvary the calvary that most people go
[2:26:05] to visit there's no way in the world
[2:26:08] that the priest from the Temple Mount
[2:26:10] could have seen Jesus dying on the
[2:26:13] cross and brother brandham not knowing
[2:26:15] the tradition of the Jewish fathers I
[2:26:17] assure you it's very unlikely that he
[2:26:20] knew knew of this most likely was
[2:26:23] speaking under
[2:26:24] inspiration and he said they could look
[2:26:26] right out there and see
[2:26:28] Christ I'm telling you that ought to
[2:26:32] shook him up yes sir and yet they didn't
[2:26:34] know they didn't know who he was they
[2:26:37] couldn't see it and there was
[2:26:40] God in plain view the
[2:26:45] sacrifice but they don't see it yet
[2:26:48] today
[2:26:50] God in this last day has rent those
[2:26:52] Traditions
[2:26:54] away let's let's amen that we can't get
[2:26:58] too caught up in that we remember them
[2:27:02] we commemorate them we celebrate them we
[2:27:05] don't try to keep them because to keep
[2:27:09] them would be holding on to something
[2:27:12] that has given
[2:27:13] away to the reality of
[2:27:16] Christ oh my sir you mean you would hold
[2:27:20] on to a Seder and reject Christ on never
[2:27:25] no no you would celebrate with a Seder
[2:27:27] right to remember Christ oh there's a
[2:27:30] balance to all things he said yet rent
[2:27:35] those Traditions away and brought the
[2:27:36] word for this age right plain in View
[2:27:38] and they still don't know it they just
[2:27:39] don't know it see it's just so simple
[2:27:41] it's so far away from the things of the
[2:27:47] world it's totally away from their own
[2:27:52] thinking and their own
[2:27:54] understanding I want you to
[2:27:57] stand musicians are
[2:28:00] coming and I want to read one
[2:28:03] more and I want you
[2:28:06] to realize that if you have received an
[2:28:10] unction of the Holy One in your life you
[2:28:13] have been
[2:28:16] Messiah I want you to look at your
[2:28:18] neighbor and say I've been Messiah
[2:28:35] Messiah and in that message the
[2:28:39] Messiah paragraph 22 he said then when
[2:28:43] God was made
[2:28:44] flesh and became the
[2:28:47] Messiah then if we can yield our
[2:28:51] ourselves to be the anointed paragraph
[2:28:55] 22 messiah in
[2:28:59] shreport then when God was made flesh
[2:29:02] and became the
[2:29:04] Messiah then if we can yield
[2:29:07] ourselves to be the anointed like he was
[2:29:11] it would have been last
[2:29:12] week's we become Messiahs yes sir it's
[2:29:17] it's the same thing yes Messiah at
[2:29:22] Messiah little
[2:29:25] lights that's what the church is
[2:29:27] supposed to be lights little anointed
[2:29:30] ones oh
[2:29:32] folks that's God's church he standing
[2:29:36] light in the he his standing light is
[2:29:39] the light of Messiah risen Christ in his
[2:29:42] people the anointed ones carrying forth
[2:29:45] his light into all the church
[2:29:48] ages sometimes it almost goes completely
[2:29:50] out and then it comes back again God's
[2:29:52] anointed one God's
[2:29:55] Messiah
[2:29:57] church if Messiah means the anointed one
[2:30:00] it means king then if the church is
[2:30:02] Anointed by the Messiah Spirit it
[2:30:05] becomes a lesser but
[2:30:06] still still I've been
[2:30:09] Messiah Hallelujah because it was his
[2:30:12] light reflecting his power reflecting
[2:30:14] his glory reflecting his
[2:30:17] dominion and so it is Messiah oh how it
[2:30:20] reflects him in his
[2:30:22] kingdom in his domain the trouble today
[2:30:26] we've organized the church to death
[2:30:28] we've got organization instead of
[2:30:29] Messiah light russellite
[2:30:32] proelite let's add
[2:30:34] bromite and all the other kinds of light
[2:30:37] but we need Messiah
[2:30:39] light yes yes yes what the church needs
[2:30:43] today the light of Messiah oh I love him
[2:30:45] for his goodness he says
[2:30:50] God called
[2:30:51] Messiahs God called us and we become
[2:30:54] Kings and Priests unto God Like Jesus
[2:30:56] was God's high priest we become a lesser
[2:30:58] priest that's good word God in fullness
[2:31:02] dwelt in him to shine forth the
[2:31:03] expression of God to the world for God
[2:31:05] was in Christ reconciling the world to
[2:31:07] himself and as God was in Christ
[2:31:09] reconciling the world to himself God
[2:31:11] comes into his church yes and anoints
[2:31:14] him some mess Messi oh my do you see it
[2:31:19] I do and I love this last paragraph he
[2:31:22] said the same things he did in his
[2:31:24] church
[2:31:30] yes same thing grab me some water
[2:31:37] please same power he had in his church
[2:31:40] his church becomes his Dominion he's

[2:31:47] sacrifices to God that's what you were
[2:31:49] doing this
[2:31:53] morning that praise becomes so sweet

[2:31:58] is Flowing an
[2:32:04] offering offering spiritual sacrifices
[2:32:07] to God thank you the fruits of our lips
[2:32:10] giving praise to his name there you are
[2:32:13] messes Messiah little Messiah little
[2:32:15] anointed ones anointed of what the main
[2:32:17] one Hallelujah anointed off of
[2:32:21] what the great
[2:32:23] one now to say that the anointing is not
[2:32:25] needed or necessary or as I heard
[2:32:28] someone recently say the word has
[2:32:30] replaced the anointing we now have the
[2:32:32] word the word is what we what move oh my
[2:32:35] goodness don't you
[2:32:38] understand that the word was first only
[2:32:42] unction it was logos first not not word
[2:32:46] first it wasn't printed page first it
[2:32:49] wasn't spoken word it was thought
[2:32:51] first because it was Spirit form it's
[2:32:54] Living Word it's Living Word that's
[2:32:57] equal it's Living Word it's not record
[2:33:00] of word a written recording of word or
[2:33:04] or magnetic recording of word it's
[2:33:06] Living
[2:33:08] Word a tape as powerful as it can be
[2:33:11] cannot restore one's spiritual
[2:33:14] virginity but the Living Word
[2:33:17] represented on that recording when it
[2:33:20] interacts with a human being a
[2:33:25] faith it
[2:33:27] quickens and it becomes
