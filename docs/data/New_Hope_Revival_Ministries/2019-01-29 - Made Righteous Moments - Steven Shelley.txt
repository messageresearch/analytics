TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he was made to be something that he was not so that you and I could be made to be something that we were not he who knew no sin was made sin and we who are incapable of producing righteousness are made righteous by the sacrifice of the Living God if you can see that same man can you see that do you know how [Music] do you know how Paul could go in with bonus because he wasn't wearing the shame of what he had done I'll tell you the best thing I ever did do when I took off the old Rob and he put on the new he dressed us in robes of righteousness that's why Paul could go on to do what he was called to do that's why he could meet God down in Arabia and come back with a revelation of the mystery of God like no one had ever had before him because he was not approaching the throne of God a widow with an apron made of fig leaves he was approaching the kingdom of God the throne of God dressed in a coat dressed in a robe of righteousness that was made possible by a bleeding lamb
