[0:00] We're blessed today
[0:01] &gt;&gt; because God set an order in the old
[0:04] covenant. He fulfilled
[0:07] in reality that order in the new
[0:10] covenant. And today as we walk in the
[0:13] outer skirts of the kingdom, we're
[0:15] coming into kingdom and we can see the
[0:18] kingdom. It's so close that by eyes of
[0:22] faith and spirit, we can see the
[0:24] kingdom. We're nearly there. I'm not
[0:26] talking about heaven.
[0:28] I'm talking about a new government,
[0:30] &gt;&gt; a new spiritual order,
[0:33] &gt;&gt; and we're closer than we've ever been
[0:35] before. There is no time for playing
[0:37] around. But we have to get a goal, a
[0:40] vision, something in front of our eyes
[0:42] that we can look to in the spirit
[0:45] because what you look to in the spirit
[0:47] is what you become in in in reality.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[0:52] &gt;&gt; We're not gazing any longer through a
[0:54] dark glass. No,
[0:57] &gt;&gt; we're not looking at Jesus anymore
[0:59] through the lattice.
[1:00] &gt;&gt; But the bridegroom has stepped out from
[1:02] behind the lattice
[1:04] &gt;&gt; and the and the mirror is clear. We went
[1:07] to the mirror expecting to see our sin.
[1:12] &gt;&gt; We went to the mirror expecting to see
[1:14] where we had aired from the from the
[1:17] instruction of God. But because of the
[1:20] unveiling, because of the apocalypsis,
[1:24] &gt;&gt; because Jesus now stands in full view,
[1:28] the word has been revealed.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; And because of that, when we went to the
[1:33] mirror expecting to see how far short we
[1:36] were, we saw another image.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; We saw something else in the mirror.
[1:41] &gt;&gt; We saw his perfection.
[1:43] &gt;&gt; We saw his blessed face.
[1:45] &gt;&gt; And we realized our only hope was to
[1:47] look unto that. look to that, look unto
[1:50] that until we become that.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; And so the the hour of seeing our
[1:57] transgression in the mirror, that's
[1:59] finished.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; And now we're seeing perfection there.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; Not ours.
[2:05] &gt;&gt; His
[2:07] not our righteousness,
[2:09] &gt;&gt; his
[2:10] &gt;&gt; not our perfe.
[2:13] &gt;&gt; Not our worthiness. his.
[2:16] &gt;&gt; He has made a way for you and I to get
[2:18] out of Satan's Eden.
[2:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. The bride is pulling herself
[2:23] through the last little hold of
[2:26] Leodysia. Just the last one. Just the
[2:29] last one. The only hold Leodysia has on
[2:31] you would be in that mind, will, and
[2:33] emotion realm and flesh realm. But
[2:36] you're pulling unto Christ. And the more
[2:38] we pull unto him, the less hold that the
[2:41] spirit of the age of Leodysia can have
[2:44] on any of us. And the kingdom starts
[2:47] pulling us on. Somebody say, "I feel the
[2:50] pull."
[2:51] &gt;&gt; What is the pull? It's a kingdom pull.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; It's a pull to take us out of the of the
[2:57] closing hours of the spirit of the age,
[2:59] Leodysia, and to place us in kingdom.
[3:02] Amen.
[3:03] &gt;&gt; Uh Jesus talks about this kingdom and
[3:06] he's been building it a long time. And
[3:08] it's not built with brick and mortar.
[3:10] It's not built with 2x4s and hammers.
[3:14] It's built a holy habitation. It's a
[3:17] It's built with lively stones.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; It's built with those things that have
[3:22] been resuscitated and resurrected by the
[3:25] spirit of Jesus Christ.
[3:27] &gt;&gt; Once we were dead. Once we were dead.
[3:29] Once we had no hope. Once we had no
[3:32] power against sin.
[3:33] &gt;&gt; Is that right? Sin ruled. Sin reigned in
[3:37] us.
[3:38] &gt;&gt; We didn't have time to think about the
[3:40] world. All we knew is that sin was
[3:42] ruling in us. But thanks be to God.
[3:46] &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God. He made the way.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; He not only made the way, he became the
[3:51] way.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; The one who knows. The one who matters
[3:55] the most
[3:56] &gt;&gt; is the one who knows it all.
[3:58] There is a protocol. I'm preaching now.
[4:01] There is a protocol
[4:03] &gt;&gt; to enter into the holy.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; The saddest part of all of this is it's
[4:08] done. The price is paid. The blood is
[4:11] there.
[4:13] &gt;&gt; And if we don't utilize and appropriate,
[4:16] if we don't take the power and authority
[4:18] of that blood and appropriate it in
[4:20] every area of our life, it's not his
[4:23] fault.
[4:24] Come on.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; It's not even the preacher's fault.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know how people love that.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; It's our own fault.
[4:33] &gt;&gt; The blood cries out. The blood of Jesus
[4:36] Christ. The blood that God created
[4:38] &gt;&gt; for the full deliverance of mankind. It
[4:41] cries out.
[4:44] &gt;&gt; Hear it.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; You can do it. Go forward.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Take it.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; Possess it.
[4:51] &gt;&gt; Apply it. Appropriate it. Don't waste
[4:54] it.
[4:56] &gt;&gt; Don't devalue it.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; Get your help. Get your deliverance.
