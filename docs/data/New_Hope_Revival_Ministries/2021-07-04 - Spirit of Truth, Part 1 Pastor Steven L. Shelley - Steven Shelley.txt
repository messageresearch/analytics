the holy ghost the sweet spirit of the lord that he's placed in your life hallelujah you may have your seats for just a moment we are going to go to prayer and take the needs that we have on our heart before the lord do you have a need today by the lifting of the hand you just have a need you just want to signify by raising your hand hold that need in your heart today i wonder how many of you remember the patterson family from norway hold up your hand hold it up high and let me see how many all right i think that may have been just before the anteces came what year did you all come sister teresa it was just before then they were with us i think two summers well i want you to know that yesterday i heard from benjamin i don't know if you remember some of them i don't i i know in one of these emails some of their names there i know there was a reuben wasn't there was there anybody call out uh ariel he was a piana is he the one that did the music can anybody else remember anyway it was a precious family that we met in norway when we were doing ministry there and they came two years in a row two summers in a row for for camp meeting and we didn't hear from them for a long time and i think benjamin was about seven years old when he was here he's the one that i've been corresponding with but my prayer request is their dad brother bert is having a brain surgery tomorrow there are two uh tumors that are benign on his brain let me see just a minute uh on the frontal lobe of the brain and they are affecting his cognitive abilities and have disturbed him quite a bit and they're thankful that they're benign but he has reached out and asked for prayer and benjamin has been streaming the services with us and i want us to believe the lord for a miracle and mom and dad are together and the family is well and uh three of them are married with families of their own and let's just lift the whole family up to the lord they really meant a lot to me and when i answered benjamin yesterday the thing that came to my mind the most was his mother could really make me laugh she had a sense of humor and i can still hear her talking about the sheep's head that was that the neighbor brought to their house and delivered and she didn't really know what to do with it she just had a such an expressive way and they meant a lot to us let's ask god for a miracle for our brother that he come through very well and also a sister nakisha has reached out and they were planning to be in church today but she has on top of all of the other things they have been fighting she has injured her foot now and needs to have that checked out but the doctor gave sister audrey a good report on friday even though those uh treatments really leave her weakened they're making progress and he is pleased with the progress that she's making because of these nerve treatments so we want to give god praise for that but also believe for a complete miracle and pray for brother steve curry and his family today and let's pray in advance for the rehearsal and for the wedding that god's perfect order and his wonderful presence will be involved with every aspect of it amen amen let's stand again as we go to prayer brother hawk i'm going to ask you to come and pray today sing this course all of you that are watching this service today i know that you have many needs and we hold them to the lord on your behalf be because he lives i can face tomorrow because he lives all fear is gone because i know [Music] he holds my future my life is worth a living just because he [Music] oh father we're so thankful today for the life that you have given us and there is nothing like being connected to you through your own spirit oh lord i'm so thankful lord if you reach down to us and you have called us to an eternal life with you [Music] and i as i've been contemplating all morning lord we were with you and in you when you came to this earth and you went on that cross we were in you you

abraham is upon our life and so i just release it over these prayer requests in the name of the lord jesus healing and restoration deliverance in the name of the lord jesus and right now there's certain circumstances that we cannot fix but when we invite the holy spirit we invite you lord right now into our circumstances into our lives into our being we just ask you to have your way in our

intended use you see god and know and we ask you to do with it as you wish in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen praise the lord this is the first sunday of the month and as we have announced previously that we would receive a principal offering on the first sunday of each month to put directly on the principle of the mortgage of this property right now that number that has been given as of july the third is one hundred and twelve thousand six hundred and sixty six dollars and eighty-three cents we are so grateful to the lord for this today is july the 4th sister beverly a very happy birthday to you god bless you when we started this effort to rid ourselves of the mortgage on this property i trust that we made it clear that we might would have to reallocate the funds if things became tight we do not want to do that so i am going to you may have noticed that it's very warm in the foyer that air-conditioned unit is out so that unit is going to have to be replaced brother man came on friday and he tried to put freon in the unit and he said it was leaking out as fast as he put it in so the unit will have to be replaced he also told me that we're very blessed because these are really 10-year units and we're on year 17. the lord is good to us that being said we are going to receive an offering because we don't know what the cost of the unit is going to be we're going to receive an offering next weekend to help to pay for that and i'm telling you that because it may affect what you give today and i'm not going to condemn you for that what the reason i'm telling you that is because we really would like for every dollar that's given today to go to that principle till that we don't have to reallocate the funds to pay for that air condition unit so if you feel like that you're really tight and you need to adjust what you give today i honor you for giving to the lord whatever way that you the lord would speak to you i honor you for your giving i honor you for paying your tithes that's a covenant you keep with the lord and i honor you for every dollar you give in an offering whatever that offering is for you are giving people and i bless you in the name of the lord so again next sunday we're going to receive an offering to try to pay for that unit that's got to be replaced for the foyer uh the the four year gets very warm but those rooms that are cut off the bathrooms and so forth it gets very hot back there so we need to get that replaced as soon as possible so that'll be an offering next sunday so if you brought an offering today to give to the principal offering so that this mortgage can be taken care of i want you to get it out and i want you to hold it up lord as we hold this offering in our hand we give it with gladness we thank you lord that this debt is coming down down down and that it is disappearing and you're going to give us the grace to get rid of it before that we have to refinance it lord i bless you for that and i decree that over this debt now lord we're asking for multiplication you see what's needed and i'm just believing you lord for everything every dollar that's needed we bless you because you are our provider now as our brothers and sisters hold their offering in their hand we're asking your blessing in their lives and ask you to give it back press down shaken together and running over may they see your blessing come back into their life we give you glory honor and praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen amen thank you lord brother robert would you come

you jesus you may be seated this morning what a wonderful privilege it is to serve the lord with gladness with joy he is wonderful and worthy to be praised we want to say happy birthday to our nation today we are very thankful to live in the united states of america we are not ignorant to all of her weaknesses and her failures but it's like it is with your own children with your own family members you don't stop loving them because they've made some mistakes there have been many many mistakes made in our nation i thought about maybe someone coming along and hearing us saying the truth is marching on and they might think we're singing about the civil war i want you to know that war is finished it's fought and it's over we're not in a civil war we're not celebrating any division like that our brother against brother we have no no joy in that but we we're following a greater truth that is marching on and uh had it not been for those who are willing to protect freedom and uh to to stand up for the disenfranchised and uh i'm i'm so thankful for i'm thankful today for legal immigration that's how we all got here and i'm thankful that god made a way to uh this united states of america to open up her arms and allow people to come who were looking for uh freedom they weren't bringing in fentanyl and uh all kinds of drugs and guns and things like that they were looking for a place to worship the lord these drugs that are coming into our nation from various sources some of which are coming through the southern border and across the waters of the caribbean and these man-made drugs some of them are hundreds of times more potent than morphine can you imagine that that touching the powder of some of these drugs can cause an overdose it can get in your bloodstream through your skin response and take your life and i support anybody who wants to slow that that down in this nation because maybe your children and my children are not bound by those things but they could have been but by the grace of god so i'm thankful for america and i pray for our president if we've ever had a president who needs prayer he needs prayer and i pray for him and i don't call him biden when i'm praying for him either i call him president biden because we've been taught that if you for some reason or another cannot respect a man you can at least and should respect the office that he holds and we can do that and we can pray for change and we can we can pray that it won't always be like it is right now but i'd rather be a part of this nation than any nation i know i'm thankful for it if i lived anywhere else in the world it would be jerusalem i can't think of anywhere else i would want to be so we are thankful for that it's much more than fireworks and hot dogs i like both but it's not about that it's about so much more than that aren't you glad to be free and aren't you glad that it gives that freedom that we have in this nation gives us freedom to worship god according to the dictates of our heart that's what we're the most thankful for amen and you may not you may not agree with all the spending and you may not agree with the child tax credit and but you'll spend it no matter as a republican or democrat in the white house you'll spend the money won't you sure i will we're just thankful i want you to know if you didn't already that we are in the dire straits a three week a three-week period of time that has been marked for many many years way back since the occupying forces of rome marched into the city of jerusalem and of course the temple was destroyed two times on the ninth of of of which is the last day of those three weeks it's sometimes referred to as the season of the basilisk in in jewish literature it's referred to as the three weeks sometimes the the times of dire straits you'll read several different uh uh terms and terminologies but it marks a very dark time in in the lives of the jewish people and we have noticed because it begins on the anniversary of the forces marching into jerusalem and ends on the day of the destruction of the temple but it was not just destroyed one time but two times on the same day years apart and most of you know that it's just it's it's just very strange when you look at history all the things that happened to the jewish people during those three weeks year after year after year after year and we have learned for the past oh 13 14 15 years to mark those things to watch those things because it's in that period that the enemy he very much likes to change a mask he's always the enemy he always is out to steal and kill and destroy but he likes to change his mask and he likes to come in and uh he especially is after eggs you say what in the world do you mean i mean something forming something spiritually forming getting ready to be born getting ready to break out and he likes to come in in that basilisk uh form he likes to come in and he likes to take the life out of something that's just being born or or forming to be born you may not think of anything in your life i can think of many things in my life that are in that embryonic stage and i'm praying and i have been since it started on june 27th i'm praying that god's holy ghost power and his holy angels will guard everything that god is forming and every little thing that has reached its embryonic stage it has not yet come to the birth we know that there's no devil in hell that can steal if we're standing in faith to protect on guard how many of you believe it's a good idea to be on guard to be watchmen of your own life and of your own family because there's impostors the enemy comes like that as an imposter and we want to know we just want to know and we want to stay on top would you help me pray for sister laurel's mother i didn't get that note for the billy in time but we want to lift her up she has had a fall and needs to be remembered to the lord very serious and needs to be lifted up to the lord today and it's heartbreaking to think of someone so senior and already in a sad shape a condition to be in in this now with a broken hip but we know that god is more than able to watch over to help you know some people say things like well where was god then he was there i tell you he was there and i'm so thankful that i know that i know that i know that i know that even when he has not prevented things from happening he's there and he's watching over and he's taking care and don't you love him i didn't even shake your hand sister wes but it's good to see you this morning we're thankful to have you [Applause] is it alan is that right alan we're glad to have you again this morning nice to see you nice to see daniel evans with us again i'm glad that that road between here and jeff is getting shorter and we're very happy to see you here today i'm glad to see the yoviches are pulling out of disease sickness and waves of it and are in the house of god today the lord is good to us isn't he i just want to i want to thank you sister tebo publicly for letting us come inviting our family we had to put it off for about five weeks didn't we have you ever invited anybody to dinner and they just start going over dates with you like that and put it off it was the only way we could get all of our children together and no wedding no rehearsal night nothing else going on and we had the most wonderful meal i don't have to go on because you know somewhere about halfway through thursday somebody said what are we going to do if she decides to make something besides chicken and dumplings i said we're going to get up mark out i knew better i had been invited for dumplings i knew what was on the menu and it was incredible you all know but what i wanted to say about it was not just the meal but it was the wonderful atmosphere sister it's the first time we've had dinner with sister tebo since brother tebow was gone and uh we missed him and we we thought about him you can't help but think about him even though he never lived in that new home he's there his presence is there and the memories of his life and him being with us is there but god has been so good to that little mississippi girl back there when i walked in her beautiful new home that god has given her you know not many people in life are given a home without a bill without a mortgage and she was given a brand new home one that she could pick out and choose given brand new furniture to sit on and uh that was the goodness of god and to her life and when i walked in the door i said oh that mississippi girl has moved up town she has really moved up town and she has and we want to congratulate you again and tell you how wonderful it was to be in your home it's nice to be welcome it's nice to feel that wonderful presence of the lord and it is so good to do it over chicken and dumplings let's stand together today all you people streaming and uh yes my wife loves you so much amy that she she realized that i missed you and she said amy we are so glad to have amy crossman with us we really are not just stacy [Applause] we saw her last night so i guess i wasn't thinking about about her but she is a sort of a visitor but we're very happy to have her today let's thank god for these musicians all they've done to help us with this atmosphere god is good isn't he good hallelujah all the time john chapter 15 let's go to the word of god today let's not sleep through it let's do everything we can to put our hearts in here today is sister beverly's birthday we want to say happy birthday to sister beverly skipworth let's clap for her [Applause] and sister audrey lewis has a birthday on wednesday uh of this week and though she's streaming and not able to be here we send a happy birthday to sister audrey lewis as well all of you that are visiting with us by the stream i'm looking on youtube now and i see uh south africa i see ghana uh i see indiana the netherlands another from cape town nairobi kenya pakistan in that exciting and uh there was a brother here oh i don't see his name right yet maybe it was somewhere else but there's a brother is it brother edmund i think it might have been brother edmund who is streaming from uh from ghana and he was telling us that it is his birthday today so what about we just send him a happy birthday oh that's right brother edmund god bless you [Applause] john chapter 15 and verse 26 but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me let me read it again but when the comforter is come whom i will send unto you from the father even the spirit of truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me aren't you glad he does would you permit me to take you now for a moment to first corinthians chapter two i'd like to read verse 6 through 14 we are continuing our series on what we are calling for lack of a better terminology the seven offices of the holy ghost and uh we really believe it's ministries or administrations of the holy ghost and sunday and tuesday night we spoke about the spirit of life anybody guess what we're going to talk about today the spirit of truth and then we'll continue on to the spirit of adoption the spirit of holiness the spirit of grace the spirit of supplication and the spirit of glory all the same spirit one holy ghost one but different administrations of who he is and i'm very very thankful for all that the holy ghost accomplishes in my life first corinthians two and six howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written i hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him period now many denominations just like to quote that part they don't like to read the next part those who deny the supernatural those who deny that he's jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever they just said well you know the bible said i have not seen near hath not heard neither hath it entered into the heart of man but look at the next verse but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit hallelujah so i hadn't seen it natural eye natural ear hasn't heard it but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit the spirit of truth for the spirit searcheth all things yay the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god oh that's good now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god we don't even know what we have we don't even know what god has given us until the holy ghost reveals it to us the spirit of truth has to show us what we have you can be walking around with privileges of bridal inheritance and not even know what you have oh but the spirit of truth is in us by the holy ghost to reveal it let me read that verse again now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom receiveth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing you want to know how the holy ghost teaches this is how comparing not just natural type spiritual that's one part of it that's one layer of revelation but if you want to get to the deep places it's not going to be just natural tapping spiritual it's going to be spiritual compared with spiritual line upon line see he goes on but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned i know you're standing have you ever tried to tell somebody something that god had made real to you and they didn't have an ear to hear i mean no ear to hearing and might even respond to you that's stupid that's just dumb you shouldn't be surprised when you get a carnal reaction from a carnal man a natural reaction from a natural man but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them to them it's not been given yet maybe not at all because these things they are spiritually discerned the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned pray with me just a moment father i want to thank you and i believe there's others in this house who want to thank you for the work the ministry the offices the administration of the holy ghost in our lives he is the government of god hallelujah lord we thank you for the government of god that is operating in the life of the believer we know we cannot overcome without the holy ghost we cannot overcome without the order of god in our life so lord we pray that you will give us grace and wisdom to keep opening up room for you to occupy for you to fill us fill every void hallelujah and give us grace to clean out more room so there be another void created so you can come and fill that too now we know that the enemy he is ever more against the revealed word of god that means he is against the ministry of the holy ghost and so he might not just be quiet and just let us talk about it without putting up a fuss but we ask for the grace of god to fill this room right now we ask lord for you to bring in a spirit of alertness and uh of being awake and that you would anoint our faith that we'll pull on the word and i believe that you will open up for us things that we need to know for the hour that we're living in right now it's it's you lord we're looking to today never to man in the precious name of the lord jesus christ yeshua our messiah we pray and the saints said you may be seated the spirit of truth the work of the spirit of truth is to bring to us a more perfect revelation of god in our lives it is not to fill us with more knowledge or to give us more information because information and knowledge is only one step in the process of revelation you have to hear something you you have to come in contact with something uh some piece of information some some bit of knowledge that is a part of the process of revelation without you ever if you and i had never heard the message of the hour we might have kept flopping around with the best that we had just flopping around over there in the barnyard oh yes i said it just flopping around in the barnyard over there but god led us here he let us hear there's more and that was information that was news to us that was news what do you mean more we're pentecostal we've had it all sanctifi justification sanctification holy ghost baptism where do you go after that isn't that all that's how we were raised those of us who had pentecostal teaching we've we've arrived we've talked in tongues we've ran around the room we've we've got the fullness but we heard some information and uh we had to make a decision about what we heard will i engage that will i dig a little more will i open up my heart will am i willing to step away from mama's teaching or daddy's teaching or the church's teaching and explore the reality that god may not be three different people will i have the courage to understand to even begin to understand uh the oneness the union that beautiful unity of the godhead am i willing to to uh re-examine my thought that if i speak in tongues i have the holy ghost and that's all there is will i be willing to take a baptism i've already been baptized what are you trying to do get me waterlogged and put me in the water again and hold me down to the bubbles aren't coming up anymore why would i need to be baptized again and most of us could say i've been baptized many times by the time we were coming to hear this truth while we'd already been baptized multiple times as though it didn't work because we were taught every time you backslide every time you make a mistake every time you do wrong you've got to come back and do your first works all over again brother branham tells us in the seals i think it is well that's all right there's nothing wrong with that but that's not what he's talking about it's all right to want to come back renew yourself and start over drive down another state nothing wrong with that but it was taught to us that it's just about necessary you're just starting out on the journey all over again but many of us were willing to entertain what we were hearing because there was something on the inside you know what it was something on the inside began to bubble it began to fizz something in the spirit man began to say that's a t-bone steak you and i had had enough bologna sandwiches over there in the pentecostal groups and we were well filled there's nothing i'll tell you there's nothing wrong with a good baloney sandwich but my my my you ever get a hold of a good filet mignon you don't have to have pig wrapped around it to be good either you get a hold of that and i'm telling you then you won't want bologna if you've got a choice on the table you'll still be satisfied to eat bologna when you get it now when sister phoebe sends it from pennsylvania you'll eat it amy where's the baloney she's in the wrong part of the state ah but now there's a time for bologna sandwiches and there's a time for filet mignon and when we begin to feast on the word of god and that reaction began to set up on the inside of us the spirit of truth began to do his work and he's still working he's still working because we don't know all there is to know we're still learning we still listen to the message and hear things that we've never heard even though we heard them we're hearing them new again i love this spirit of truth that lives in me because he knows when in my life i am most needy and most ready to receive another layer of something god is trying to make real to me he knows where i am in my own mind and we get in a place sometime we just we just feel like we're shorting out and we can't receive any more and the lord will just refill re-feed us something we've already chewed on and it sustains us it's like beef jerky you just chew it and you get some some strength from it some protein from it but then you move into another season of your life where you're ready to have a little more understanding and god wants you to have understanding because you cannot defeat the devil with a good idea but you can defeat the devil with a revelation by the holy ghost you can choose when i woke up this morning the song in my spirit was a song that i haven't heard in quite a while and i had even forgot until i mentioned it to joshua and daniel and mariah on the way to church this morning uh and and joshua said well dad you know that song is from facing the giants and uh that's a film a christian film that most of you all have seen and i forgot the song was even from facing the giants but i woke up this morning singing the voice of truth maybe because i've been studying all week the spirit of truth but it was in me i woke up with it the voice of truth tells me a different story there's a lot of voices calling out to me so we listened to it on the way over here and i thought wow no wonder that was in my in my spirit when i woke up this morning he's talking about walking on water in the storms and he said the waves are calling out my name aren't they don't they do it sometime but i hear another voice in the midst of the waves in the midst of the storms i hear another voice hallelujah demo voices are saying you'll never win you'll never win you're going to lose again you're just a loser but there's another voice it's not always the loudest voice but there's another voice to the believer and it says just try one more time just believe with everything that's within you just keep pressing with everything you have and don't be discouraged by the voices that say you'll never win come on brother and sister and then that second verse is so good it talks about david standing before the giant and there's thousands of giant voices voices of the giants calling out you'll never win you'll never win but the voice of truth tells me a different story and i i tell you there's a line in there that that says and i will choose i will choose to listen i will choose to listen i'm asking you bride of christ today choose which voice you'll listen to in this hour the enemy will tell you you'll never get over what you're going through right now but i'm asking you to make a better choice you don't have to listen to that devil you don't have to listen to his lies there's a voice of truth in you the spirit of truth lives in the believer by the baptism of the holy ghost and he wants to lead you and he wants to give you strength anybody with me he wants to give you strength to shut down the voices of the waves that says you're going under he wants to give you strength to shut down the voices of the giant that says you'll never be able to get over this situation you'll never have the victory over this you'll never be any different than you are right now you're going to have to make a choice and again tomorrow and again the next day and again the next day and the next day and the next day i can choose what voice i listen to i can't choose what i hear it'll just come the enemy will just bombard you he'll send waves and giants won't he though you can't stop that you'll never stop that devil he'll lie he'll scream he'll holler the waves will harass the giants will intimidate but you can make a choice that's gonna i tell you what i'm gonna shed that like a duck sheds water i'm gonna let that bounce off of me like a rubber dart that ain't me that's not me that's not me there's a voice of truth that says you can make it you can go forward i tell you i'm i'm stirred up because i'm so thankful to know and to be able to report to you today that everything you need everything you need to get over your stuff now i'm loud but if if i can't get you to stay awake we'll get louder because i want you to hear this you won't have to bother me this week with some of your stuff i'm being very sincere here you won't have to bother me this week with some of your stuff if you'll listen to what i'm saying there's a better voice oh you'll never win you'll never win you'll always lose you're a loser you're this you're that and the other you know what i have lost i have lost a time or two i have made some big mistakes in my life but they're not who i am they don't define me hallelujah god doesn't put his holy ghost in junk he doesn't put it in a trash can he puts it in the life of someone that he saw making the right choice before they were ever born yes i'm not just trying to pip you up i'm trying to tell you the truth you didn't just receive the holy ghost to pray in the spirit you didn't just receive the holy ghost to have goosebumps on your hair your hair stand up and goosebumps on your arm he's with us not just to comfort us but i tell you he's there to fight for us he's there to give us what we need and what we need to win the win this thing and defeat the enemy is truth we need truth truth wins it wins it wins it wins i'm going to pass over some verses of scripture here uh and come back to them perhaps tuesday night or another time i want to go on to john chapter 16 just a moment i want to go down to verse 12. jesus had said many things to his disciples already but he was finding out that they couldn't really bear them now that's what i was talking about just a moment ago they were not in the right mentality they were not in the right place in their mind in their in their soul to be able to receive what he had to say and i'll tell you that's a bad place and jesus knew there was a way he knew there was a way that that was going to be changed because he realized that it was easier for them to be in that place as long as he was just with them but he knew that if i can get out of here then he who lives in me can come back and live inside of them and when he comes back to live inside of them they'll find the strength they need to choose what to listen to and they will be able to receive some of the strong meat that they're not mature enough to receive in this hour one of the jobs one of the ministries one of the administrations of the spirit of truth by the holy ghost in your life is to bring you to a place of maturity because a more complete a more perfect revelation of jesus christ will bring us to a new level of maturity i'm telling you revelation is not just to puff you up and so you can talk loud and tell everybody you know more than they do no no no it becomes weapon i want you to know i believe that revelation by the spirit of truth has a physical effect on our own body i believe our physical body the cells of our body are affected by revelation of truth that we receive from the word i believe it can change many many things i believe it can greatly affect and rewrite our dna i believe it can bring a purification process to many sluggish systems of the body i believe that when the prophet is talking to us about see that you touch not the oil and the wine uh when he's giving us the seals he's talking about or the church ages perhaps also he's talking about the the uh revelation the the inspiration that br the intoxication that comes by revelation see that wine represents that place of what's the word is it what was the word he used stimulation thank you i could not get it i remember i remember the first time i used that word among charismatic people they thought i had said something filthy they did not like that word at all i had to explain to them what that means i said don't look don't sit there and look at me like i've just said something vulgar i want you to have anybody in this house ever ever receive something from the lord that became so invigorating and so stimulating that you no longer saw how high the wall was or how wide the troops were and you just said wow through the lord i can run over woo i can get over the wall i can run through the troop it didn't change how high the wall was didn't change how mighty the troop was it changed how you felt about your walls it changed how he felt about the armies that were before him and and you know there's nothing like it there's nothing like the holy spirit pouring inspiration on something that's been stirring around in you and you become uh stimulated to run on to to kick the devil has he ever kicked you the rest of you are silent he may not kick you because he may be controlling you you might ought to start kicking him and see who's really in charge jesus said in john 16 12 i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now i like this in the amplified i'm going to read several of these sayings of jesus in the amplified in the same same place 16 12. he said i have still many things to say to you but you are not able to bear them or to take them up upon you or to grasp them now you need something to come along and help you be able to grasp some of these uh stronger things that i want to i want to share with you and so he goes on to say there's a way being made i'm not mad at you there's a way being made that you're going to be able to grasp and get a hold of what you can't get ahold of now look at verse 13 king james he said howbeit when he whoo i'm going to wait on you because i want them to see it there's three places in the book of john where jesus talks about the spirit of truth and i want you to see all three here's the second one he said howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will can't you hear him preaching on the god can't you hear him preaching on the god he will guide you into all truth don't you tell me you've heard three messages you not you got it all i stood in a jungle in uganda africa one time with a single light bulb hanging down and a preacher who was opposing me and they took me to meet him because he was filling up the mailbox with all of these hundred page letters he was writing about how wrong i was to call names in the pulpit the problem was the name i called was not a thunder preacher like he thought he was he was a newscaster his name was cronkite howard is it howard cronkite walter oh there's a lot of old folks here today i don't know how many evenings i spent with my grandparents in walter very distinguished fellow of me wide hair and big bushy mustache and i said at one time preaching in the early 90s i don't care what walter cronkite says about it and he wrote a hundred pages on why i shouldn't be calling other preachers names in the pulpit on his way to coal mine and he found a few other things like that and uh so we went and met him and they took me over there and he has i'm not making fun and i want you to know we didn't leave that man in that condition we made sure he got everything he needed to decide what the truth was he still couldn't be helped i won't tell the rest of the story but sister knows the rest of the story very very serious and very very tragic in many many many years later to that but we certainly tried you you can put it in front of people but that don't necessarily mean they'll get it but he got over in my face i can see his big teeth and he got over my face like that and he said i know the message of the hour and i know that you're calling blah blah blah no no no no no no and i said brother show me how you know it show me how it come to you and he had a little stack of spoken word books about that about that thick i don't know how many sermons were there and maybe maybe two or three or four or five cassettes i don't remember how many but they were just stacked like that that's precious and i know what the prophet said it only takes one one message to reach them but i want you to know you hear them all and read them all and it not be yet a part of who you are so if it were not for the spirit of truth you could listen to all the messages that god's given us in this day read all the books and still not know any more than you knew when you started because it's not getting more information that helps you it's when the when the spirit of truth rises up in you and he starts saying amen then it goes deeper than the intellect that's when it drops from the head to the heart hallelujah and before it's over he puts it in your hands and your feet so that you can walk it out so that you can live it it's not how much of the word of god you go through it's how much of god's word goes through you there's a digestion that takes place and i want you to know the spirit of truth is actively involved in helping you to digest to receive the truth and there is a transformation that takes place in our lives because of the spirit of truth whether we're aware of it or not can anybody say amen now he goes on how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear the spirit of truth the spirit of truth somebody's talking to the spirit of truth what he shall hear that shall he speak that's the godhead you see how they work together you see how there's three distinct offices but of the same spirit one god not three people trying to get it right come on now here jesus said he's not gonna come and talk about himself he's going to speak what he hears do you know anybody else like that besides jesus because remember the bible said that jesus was not there he he waited for the father he spoke what the father was speaking he shared what the father was sharing now jesus is telling us there's another ministry the spirit of truth by the holy ghost when he comes he will not speak of himself he will speak what's spoken to him just like jesus so where does it come from the eternal spirit it comes from what there was in the beginning it comes from father it comes from papa it comes from abba anybody with me he will wait and hear what is spoken to him and he will show you things to come because there's a voice even working now let me read that in the amplified and i'm going to wait on you to to uh to pull that up i didn't give you much time while ago not even a warning here's a bit of a warning john 16 13 in the amplified all red letters i wish you could see how red it is it is red letters here he said but when he the spirit of truth the truth-giving spirit comes he will guide you into all the truth parentheses the whole full truth for he will not speak his own message on his own authority but he will tell whatever he hears from the father he will give the message that has been given to him well does that help anybody i like that and he will announce and declare to you the things that are to come that will happen in the future that's who he is he comes not just to reveal the future but he comes to speak in us what the father's saying you want to know the father's heart the holy ghost is here to tell you you want to know how the father feels about you and your life the holy ghost is here to talk for him you understand same spirit it's just a different ministry because the spirit of the father when he operates his father he's above you when he operates his son he's with you when he operates his holy ghost where is he you say that all the time glad you noticed that wasn't a senior moment that time i meant to say it again i'm going to say it again before i stop here probably and i'll probably say it again tuesday night because i cannot get enough of this revelation of who this is living inside of me not an imposter not just an ambassador but one who has full governmental authority in my life he has got the authority would you give me a the paragraph if you will number 12 from the message god this is a is a small commentary on the verse i just read he said now in this 13th verse how be it when the spirit of truth is come he will guide you unto all truth when the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth not just unto that's up to the door but into that's through the door he said he will guide you into all truth he said what is truth do you remember who asked that in the book of acts what is truth and how many of you know he was told he got the message what is truth what is truth the word the word see it with me somebody the word whose word his word the word of the father made real to you by the holy ghost quickened to life that was the first office that's the first ministry of the holy ghost the spirit of life he resurrects he takes a word that can be used as a dead letter and he breathes on it and he brings it to life oh you become a dynamo you become a dynamo i didn't mention that i i didn't even give you that i skipped around but let me just go back just a moment see if i can see that it's that it's that word power that we talk about in acts one and eight but you shall receive dunamis you shall receive power and it's from that word dunamis that we get the word dynamo let me tell you the two things a dynamo is a dynamo is a device capable of producing or reproducing electricity specifically a direct current but when the spirit has come upon you you shall be capable of reproducing electricity of a particular current and then number two is an extremely energetic and forceful person see sometimes what others condeme you for is what the holy ghost came to make you now we've all got a place we've got a position to minister in and to serve in we can talk about the authority of the family and so forth and etc and who's to handle the word and not to handle the word we can go through god's plan there's i love it i love it i'm not against it i love it but i want you to know the holy ghost has come to make you a dynamo a force to be reckoned with and it's not your spirit that gets amplified and magnified it's his spirit and when your spirit is joined with his spirit i want you to know he becomes a dynamo inside of you and you're going to be a little energetic but you don't know how i feel oh yes i do it's obvious [Music] more people know how you feel than you think you make it pretty obvious but i want you to know there's a dynamo living inside of you whoa he's not trying to just see how smart he can make you he's there the truth does something i want you to know the truth does something in us the truth accomplishes something in us are you with me for he shall speak what is truth the word for he shall speak he shall not speak of himself but what he hears he'll speak what he hears he'll speak other words he'll be the one that will reveal the thing you see yes i see hallelujah i'm glad i do see and the fourth chapter of hebrews the bible said that the word of god is sharper more powerful than a two-edged sword a discerner of the thoughts of the mind the heart see what he hears he'll speak and he will show you things to come see what's going to do that listen the holy spirit who will come in the name of the lord jesus that's the god that's the god you don't have to hire him you don't have to find him you don't have to wait for him to work you in on his calendar he lives in you by the baptism of the holy ghost and if you're not sure he does you better get sure you better make sure because when he comes and when we yield he's going to change our behavior now i want to tell you something here i'll get to this when we talk about the spirit of holiness and uh we'll get to it a little later we have to get adoption in and then we'll get to the spirit of holiness but i want to talk to you for just a second here and just kind of insert this in your mind there are there is an old mentality that came from pentecost from our background that you've got to get to a certain place you know you you've got to fulfill a certain percentage of the of the word before you can receive the holy ghost i've been in services as a boy where they would get a woman a sweater to cover up her elbows so she could receive the holy ghost they were well-meaning because they knew there were some old dirty men in the church i'm sure that were lusting after women's elbows this was the mentality the mentality was we got to do this so we can get the holy ghost i don't know how many people would feel like they couldn't get the holy ghost because they were still struggling with cigarettes he said well god's not going to dwell in an unclean vessel he didn't come to live in a smokehouse they they i remember i remember i remember i remember the things they said they meant well i'm not at all criticizing where they were that's where they were but i want you to know the first person i hate to say this but the first person i ever heard to say any better was my grandmother i've told you many times she said i just can't accept that she said i just have to believe the holy ghost will sometimes fill you on a credit she said how else are you ever going to get rid laid down the things that are in your life brother branham took us to a whole other level he taught us that all those things are attributes of what sin really is it's not getting rid of the drink it's not getting rid of the cigarettes it's not getting rid that's not the sin problem the problem is the unbelief and when we get rid of the unbelief it helps us have strength and power when he the spirit of truth has come so i don't know if that's the right terminology it's probably not very theologically sound to say the holy ghost fulfill you on a credit but i want you to know you invite him wake up your neighbor you invite him he'll come and he'll give you strength if you bless him if you let him if you let him he'll give you strength to lay down the thing that is trapping you and tripping you and taking you further away from the things of god and one of the reasons why the holy ghost wants to help you it's not because god can't tolerate your stuff he wants wants to give you power over it because it's not holy it's not clean he wants to bring you out of uncleanness but that's not why he's doing it because he can't stand your stuff he loves you he wants to help you with your junk he does that because he knows if he can get inside of you and fill you up i'll i'll read you another quotation in a moment you'll find strength to start pushing things things you could never get over things you could never get over before oh i thank god for this sanctifying work of the holy ghost i thank god that the blood and the spirit of god is still working in us we didn't get it all overnight no no no no no the holy spirit now we can't really know the fullness of god without engaging the spirit of truth we can learn of him but to know him to know him it's not something we do because we've been to sunday school that's not how we know him we learn of him we learn of him but it's more than that it's engaging it's allowing it's yielding to somebody say yielding to it's yielding to the spirit of truth because you know what you you keep shutting him down you keep arguing with him he'll hold his peace brother branham explained it he said it's like a bird you've disturbed him thank god he don't forsake you i'm not going to preach a doctrine hear this not bible you see i don't believe there's such a thing as being unfilled with the holy ghost there's such a thing as being filled again more more refilled he said refilled fill me up fill me up fill me up but i know what can happen you can quit listening to him and you grieve him which is sin by the way and we want to be very careful how we handle that right because this is the holy ghost we're talking about and and because the atmosphere of your life is a little muddled he'll just take his flight and find a little perch right out right out there he said this happens in a church sometime he'll just take a little just take a little flight he's still watching over he's he hasn't gone far but he's looking for the right kind of nature he's looking for the lamb's nature how many of you know the dove is always looking for the lamb's nature my my my that's the truth we can't really know god not really know him the way we want to know him without listening without engaging without cooperating with the spirit of truth because we can't receive anything that god has for us in the light of his word if the holy spirit does not illuminate that word and make it alive brighten to us look at john chapter 16 and i'll hurry i will i'll push a little quicker i'll stay on try to stay on point a little more john chapter 16 and verse 15 in king james first and then i'm going to read it an amplified since it's just a verse all things that the father hath are mine this is what color this is red letter this is jesus talking he said all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto thee oh the work of the holy ghost things that the father hath are mine jesus said therefore said i jesus that he shall take of mine jesus and shall show it unto you believer look at the amplified i like it it says everything that the father has is mine he said this is what i meant when i said that he the spirit will take the things that are mine and will reveal declare disclose transmit it to you you've got the holy ghost the spirit of truth lives in you you've got the receiver you've got the antenna that you need to pick up the signal of what has already been said of the father to jesus because truth is not an inanimate emotion or some blob something without definition truth is not a concept or an idea truth is what truth is a person are you awake truth is a person his name is jesus christ tell me what his name is jesus christ could i have paragraph 5 of 2c jesus chicago he says in paragraph 5 i am very thankful that this spirit of truth was to be with us to the end let's just put a pause there for just a moment why do you need the spirit of truth to the end once you come to the message don't you know it all once you receive the ministry of a prophet don't you know it all once you've committed to tapes only don't you know it all why would we need the spirit of truth all the way up to the end it's the same reason why we need the father ministry since we mentioned it we need it until we need it all the way up until we can come together in the unity of faith god's got a complete work that he wants to accomplish in his bride church and we're going to need the spirit of truth because i want to tell you something if we bite and devour and fight one another based on quotes then we are no better than the denominations who also lift scripture verses out of context if we're guilty of taking brother branham's words and lifting them out of the context of which they were spoken so that we can win an argument oh i'm preaching to somebody may not be nobody here i don't know but i'm preaching to somebody then we're no we're no more uh we're just as guilty as the denominational spirit that lifts the verses out of context and uses them to fight one another you see somebody following the spirit of truth is not going to be thrown off by how many people fell off a bridge those who are following the spirit of truth are not going to be thrown off by by the by the most popular facebook group who's there to point out all the humanity leaving out all the spirituality come on you can read an article i don't care how many articles you read ah you most of those not all of them and most of them are written by people who already now have such a sellout they have such a sellout spirit on them there's really no way to describe it except to call it what it is it's a judah spirit and they're already so under the influence of that judas spirit that they don't even realize what they're doing by picking and choosing by choosing rather to focus on the humanity of a man instead of all the miracles all the supernatural and here's what i'm going to focus on not the miracles not the supernatural i'm not even going to focus on the gift what i'm going to focus on is the dovetailing of scripture and revelation truth boy when this message is laid up against that word and if it fills in there so tight that you can't get a little drop of oxygen through there i'm telling you i'm going to stand in that i'm going to hide in that that's what i'm going to hide in in this hour i'm not going to be moved here and there by those who think they know more they're always going to be people who think they know more than the ones that have lived it yes ma'am i'm going to tell it because it's the truth but that doesn't change things for you you've got to stay with the word stay with the truth he said uh i am very thankful that the spirit of truth was to be with us to the end to the end and that spirit of truth is none other you wanna know what this is in here what it is in your life it is none other but the lord jesus himself in spiritual form spirit form that's what the holy ghost is jesus in spirit form hallelujah that's what he said i'm not going to leave you i'm going to come to you i'm going to make sure you don't have to do this by yourself so he said the spirit of truth is none other but the lord jesus himself in spiritual form for he said a little while and the world seeth me no more come on brother it is good sister it is good because it's a real understanding of the word for he said a little while the words world seeth me no more yet you shall see me for i'll be with you that's good that's good even in you how long to the end of the world and that means tonight listen that means tonight and wherever we are we have the comforting words of knowing that jesus will be with us oh how long is he going to be with us till the end you tell me where the end is for the believer because we're going to step out of time one of these days and go live in the realm where he lives where there is no time but in eternity so how long is he going to be with us and in us forever oh this is a finished work now somebody one brother was was uh recommending was recommending the service he he sent us a beautiful email and he said last sunday i think it was last sunday he was ill and not able to go to his church and he was he was getting ready to tune in to his service and saw on facebook where our service popped up and he just felt like he ought to watch it now i'm not recommending that someone miss their service online to see our service i'm not recommending that because you you have a church if you have a church well you want to be faithful to that church and these are archived and you can go back and watch them another time but i'm glad he did because he wrote of what kind of help he got and what kind of a blessing he got so i'm not i'm not thinking that's the best way to do you you should stay faithful and loyal and plugged in and connected to your church and but maybe he didn't know for sure he could get back and see it again and so after it was over he went in and recommended it to someone else and uh just tagged them in it and and some some other person a lady she watched it and she said i really like that and she said one of the reasons why is because it's not a mega church and he said no he said i was trying to counter i was looking around he said i didn't see but about 70 people there in the service and that would have been about right last sunday and he said that's what i saw well i thought about that and i thought well you know i'm not ashamed of that i'm not ashamed of that i wish we were running i believe we will be i really do believe we will be filled one day and uh like i told the chiropractor he said uh well you about to get done with the weddings i said no no we got one more and he said then i said uh about nine months down the road 12 months or so a year we'll we'll be doing the baby showers then he said reckon so i said yes i reconciled that's the way it works isn't it i said it to him that's the way it works isn't it he's not married i don't think and i said that's our idea of church growth [Applause] and he really laughed and then he told then he told me a funny pastor's joke but i'm not gonna tell it this morning but it's it's funny i'll tell you sometime when i'm not preaching it's not the place but it sure did make me laugh so listen to this paragraph here about that he said and wherever we are we have the comforting words of knowing that jesus will be with us he said too many of you people here who go to little churches no matter how small the church is jesus said if even two or three were gathered together in his name he'd be with them he said what a comforting words is to know no matter how small our little congregation is yet the lord jesus is with us and we're happy for that brother that's what i tell you what that means a lot that means a lot to know that he's with us and we can keep him here long enough somebody else will want to come be where he is so i still believe that there are those to come i do i really do now look at john 14 16 oh it's 105. i'm doing pretty good i got a little more time here john 14 16 oh every time i hear people kind of kidding about how long the sunday morning service i just say well you know what i'm ready i'm anytime anytime we take a vote and we start having sunday night service i'm very rich no i'd rather then you're gonna stay awake on sunday morning i'm gonna find me a deacon with a with one of them pilgrim sticks and i will pray the father john 14 16 and i will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you how long forever remember last week we talked about that word another in the greek and it means another but of the same kind hallelujah not an imposter another but of the same kind and in the amplified i like it i'm sorry i can't help it and i will ask the father and he will give you another comforter counselor helper intercessor advocate strengthener and stand by that he may remain with you forever how many of you have ever needed a strengthener [Laughter] whoa as we walk with the spirit of truth communing with him and yielding to him the divine truth that's a person the living word the divine truth is ever expanding in us i want to read it again communing with him as we walk with the spirit of truth communing with him and yielding to him divine truth is ever expanding in us bringing us to a mature more mature relationship with god jesus was talking to the disciples he said i'm going away but don't get too upset i'm sending one of you one to you who is just like me and he is going to teach you some things he is going to show you some things he's going to be so close much closer to you than i can be because he is going to be in you the holy ghost is doing something for you that jesus could not do in his form he's coming to bring god in you are you with me now let's go back to john 14 again we read 15 and 16 let's read verse 17. both king james and amplified we're hurrying yes we are this is hurry even the spirit of truth there's the third time whom the world cannot receive let's just go to the amplified you people can do your homework you can go back and read it in the king james let's just go to the amplified to save a minute here since i'm going there anyway the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive welcome take to its heart because it does not see him or know him or excuse me or know and recognize him but you know and recognize him for he lives with you constantly jesus he sleeps where you're sleeping he eats a meal where you're eating a meal you know you know me they don't know me i want you to think of all the terrible things that were being said about jesus at the church on the hill he was being accused of all kinds of things insurrection blasphemy it goes on and on the list goes on and on i want you to know there are people talking about him everywhere we used to sing a song in church choir in school choir uh he was the talk of the town anybody i think dottie ramble wrote it he was the talk of the town some folks were lifting him up others were putting him down he was healing the lame in the temple delivering souls that were bound he was a man of fame the devil knew him by name he was the talk of the town the church on the hill had plenty to say about jesus but he said you know me because you're living with me you're spending time you want to know somebody you spend a little time with them and i i you spend a lot of time with them because it's you only so long you can be on your best behavior you know we do this we we use this phrase sometimes doing life that's what i'm talking about do in life we do life with them then you see them when they're up and you see them when they're down and you see them when they're in between and that's when you really know who they are it's too bad it has to be after marriage but it does don't misunderstand me can't edit live services i still mean it god had a reason and an order but i want you to know the point remains it's when you're doing life with somebody that you really learn who they are and you can hear what they're saying about him up on the hill the church on the hill but you know better because you've done life with him this is what jesus was saying he said because it does not see him or know him or recognize him but you know and recognize him who the spirit of truth he said the spirit of truth is with you it was in another form but the spirit of truth was with him but you know and recognize him for he lives with you constantly oh and then those next words and will be in you oh thank you lord thank you that you had to go jesus thank you that you thank you that you came defeated death hell in the grave thank you that you had to go because if you go if you'd win like you did then that same spirit of truth that was in you could now come and be in the life of the believer oh see church it's more than a feeling here's what i like i like the fact that we don't have to summon or invite the holy spirit i just tell you i don't believe that most charismatics out there and and probably pentecostal either i just don't think they really understand this because i'm all the time hearing them inviting the holy spirit that sounds episcopalian or something to me i'm inviting the holy spirit where do you think he is he doesn't float around the room like casper the friendly ghost come on he's in the believer jesus didn't sin the father didn't send the holy ghost so that he could be some kind of mist that was a symbol that he had come that pillar of fire licks of fire appeared as licks of fire over their head but he didn't stay how many of you know the holy ghost didn't stay over their head he came to live inside of them so who are you talking to summoning inviting the holy spirit to come as though he works some outside in ministry if you've received the baptism of the holy ghost you're not inviting him to come into your situation he's already in your situation because he's in you wait a minute they're dozing in here he's in you what do you think is going to happen that dove's going to come flying in the room when you call him it's not that we need to summon him up or beat the drum until he comes he's in us you know what you don't even have to invite him to stand up in you you just got to sit down you sit down and he'll stand up he'll rise up whoa i feel good he'll rise up i'll tell you about fireworks i feel some fireworks going off inside of me right now reminding me i don't have to beg the holy ghost into my life into my hardships he's there i just got to hush i've just got to get out of the way give him some room he'll stand up in you hallelujah no the work of the holy spirit is not an outside-in ministry it's an inside-out ministry write that down i don't see no pencils moving hallelujah it's power and promise that transforms us from glory to glory to glory to glory to glory my my my yes now look at john 14 26 you're going to think i already read this but i read john 14 16. this is john 14 26. i think we might have started but i'm going to go back to it let's go straight to the amplified thank you but the comforter counselor helper intercessor advocate strengthener standby the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name in my place whoo to represent me and act on my behalf oh this is red letter he will teach you all things and he will cause you oh i like this lord knows i need this he will cause you to recall will remind you of bring to your remembrance everything i have told you that's his work that's his ministry come on now the spirit of truth is always bringing back to our remembrance the word anybody need to remember the word how many of you need to remember what the word said when when do you need to remember what the word said all the time but especially when you're in the mess when you're in the ditch when you're in the battle because that's when that old spiritual spiritual amnesia will try to get a hold of you that's when the paradox of forgetfulness sets in and you start remembering what you ought to forget and forgetting what you need to remember that's why the holy spirit and his ministry is so powerful in our lives that's why particularly when he ministers as the spirit of truth it's such a powerful and precious work that he does because he brings all things pertaining to the word of god back to our remembrance one one of if not the key purpose of the spirit of truth is as we walk in communion and we yield to the spirit of truth that divine truth that we mentioned a minute ago is expanding in us and we are being changed and we are being brought into a more mature relationship with the father i'm going to read uh two more paragraphs and i'm going to try to be uh finished here around right at 1 30. the harvest time i'm going to read two paragraphs not together but from the same message one uh is paragraph 160 and the next is paragraph 177 but jesus said when he the spirit of truth is come i'm just reading quotations that i found pertaining to the verses that we just read i like doing it that way one of these days i'd like to share some of that with you in in paper form because i've been working on that a lot over the past couple of years and that is bringing the quotes to match the verses especially from the gospels and i've got several of the epistles that are started they're not finished i don't know if i could ever live long enough to finish all the places just think about all for instance hebrews you you start putting the verses of hebrews together and then start putting the quotes like like the revelation thing that the brother did and you all are are working on to get it so we could print it for people or they could download it the places and yet when i when i look at that i find many many many many things he said about those verses in revelation that are not included in that book and it's almost like a lifetime of of gathering but but when i read a verse and then i follow that up with with what brought was brought to us under the inspiration of the holy spirit i'll tell you it it sings in me you you call me a man follower if you want to or whatever else you but it just sings in me it just really really amplifies it in my heart and so here is uh 160. he said but jesus said when he the spirit of truth is come see he will bring these things that i have taught to your memory the word i need it lord i need that and he'll also show you things to come he said there is the real spirit-filled church now stays with the word reflects the word and look at what that phrase is after that god on earth it is good it's god on earth somebody said i don't know how you can say that jesus jesus said we're just parroting what he said same god in you same god in jesus same spirit hallelujah i don't think that's off i think that's in he'll show you things to come there's the real spirit-filled church now stays with the word reflects the word god on earth see he doesn't need any theologian because his word is of no private interpretation listen how god interprets his word he interprets his own word by vindicating it and proving it it's the truth the random said he interprets it by bringing it to pass by bringing it to path i love that now look at paragraph 177 he said watch now as we hurry up through when the spirit of truth is come he will teach you all things whatever i taught you oh my bearing all remembers to you what i've said to you bringing to you all remembrance and he will show you things to come he will vindicate every word confirming the word with signs following everything that he promised that god promised in the bible if you'll turn loose if you'll turn loose if you'll turn loose from every creed and everything else and do what hold on to the word god is obligated to take care of where's the word it's in you no wonder god's taking such good care of you you're a word you are a word sent from god and so when they did this the word vindicates itself i'll tell you that's powerful you've got time for one more verse thank you so much and we're done second corinthians chapter 3 verse 17 and 18. there's no way in the world that we could do this in one probably not even two but what i would like to do is stay on this schedule unless the spirit moves to something else we'll come back to it sunday morning and then the following tuesday night on each one of these offices corinthians chapter 3 verse 17 and 18 now this the lord now the lord is the spirit that's simple and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty excuse me i'm sorry now the lord is the spirit that's that that spirit and the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all oh thank you now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty emancipation from bondage i didn't have that one in the amplified but it's precious it's great thank you now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty emancipation from bondage freedom somebody say freedom now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we all with unveiled faith verse 18 king james beholding in a mirror the glory of the lord are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory just as by the spirit of the lord did you what verse did you have up there in the amplified put it up again and let me let me look at it for some reason i didn't grab the the amplified in that but i sure appreciated you having it is that is that 18 it's really amplified isn't it let's read it thank you and all of us as with unveiled face because we continued to behold in the word of god as in a mirror the glory of the lord are constantly being transfigured into his very own image let's don't miss this you you become what your gaze at you're constantly being transfigured into his very own image in ever increasing splendor and from one degree of glory to another for this comes from the lord who is the spirit i tell you what that is powerful truth how many of you are thankful for the liberty that the spirit of truth has brought to your life let's stand together musicians come on please how blessed we are to have this holy spirit working in our lives revealing the truth of jesus to us oh my how blessed how blessed how blessed we are lord we thank you we thank you for the voice of truth you've got something you can lead us in worship with for just

the lord if you need prayer when we have dismissed the service we'll stay and pray for you we know that god can meet your need he wants to and uh it's not that in any way that we thought someone hadn't done it right or anything like that but we combined the text i think david had done some maybe josh i don't know who all had done them but i was in four group texts for the young people so we combined them into two that every person like that who would want to be interested in their volleyball going zone and whatever else they do together now everybody there was five or six people that were in no list they weren't getting the information and now they're all in and so if that worried you or wearied you or bothered you or offended you i apologize it's done and those are going to be the group texts that we're going to use from from now on forward for what goes on with the young people so that we can keep up with it there were people responding and others didn't know they were responding and so this is a way that we can get and listen if you're going to participate in something if somebody takes the time to put something together and arrange chaperones and whatever if you're going to come let them know how many of you know what a tap back is is that what you call it i don't know if they have that on android what what do they have on android you know where you can hard it or thumb it or put a thumb up or you just touch it and it'll let you if you don't have that well you can't do it then but but you can emoji uh on iphone you can just tap it and it'll give you a choice of what to do you can put a heart you can put a thumbs up you can put something somebody said you're really telling us this i really am are you really take i really am taking your time to tell you that because i just learned i think jennifer jernigan taught me some time ago she put a heart on oh you can do that you you owe people the respect you know to make a little quick response and let them know that you got the message and if at all possible if you can't go you just say okay i can't be there but that's just the way you do it how many of you know that's the way you do it you do it on your job that way when they put out something wanting to know who's going to be in a meeting you have to let them know you're going to be there or that you're not going to be there it's very difficult to plan if you don't take the time and the courtesy to be totally honest with you it's just discourteous not to do it so just take that little moment to be the outstanding young person you are young married people are on that list as well just take a moment just to let them know what you're doing charity sent out one today i didn't see many people responding if you're going to be there let them know just let people know that's good it's good isn't it yeah i'm going to wait a few more weeks and and i don't want to be that guy that bombards people with a text every week so i'm going to wait a few weeks and if i don't hear something from some of you i'm just i'm just going to assume that you've got too much to read there is so much to read and i don't need something every week i don't and my feelings are not involved in this i just don't want to bombard you if you're getting too much i don't want to be that one that's causing that to happen but it's good to to read it anyway if you do get it you ought to read it and see if there's anything the lord will use in that to speak to you about sometimes we just need to be reminded well how brothers and sisters should act toward one another and maybe some things we can't sort out but we can sort out courtesy we can be courteous we can be respectful we can show honor and respect to one another if it's just something simple like that so i encourage you to do that the young people sure do like being together they get carried away sometime in their competition but they really do love being together i'd rather them be together i'd rather them be together and i know today is an exception but i'd rather them be together and i'd rather than be on this campground when they're together than anywhere else in the world because i know what god has given given this to us for and that was to keep people as close as we possibly could to one another and it it is wonderful to have somebody to fellowship with even if it is in on a volleyball court or something like that there's going to be some fellowship for the young people here tomorrow afternoon and we're not trying to take anybody away from their family event you do family i think that is important but some folks don't have a lot of family in this area to be with and they want to be with one another so don't ever take it like someone's trying to pressure you they just want to be together i like to make it possible when we can anybody understand where we're coming from we want to pray again when we leave here today we want to pray for a crystalline and for michael uh because they're our family they're part of us and i'm sure there are details coming together that have to come together at the last minute and i'm sure there's a lot of those stresses and strains that come up and getting everybody on the same page is never easy and uh but i want the lord to just overshadow the rest of this and if you hear somebody say something like i'll be glad when this is over it's not to take away from their celebration it's just you just finally get to a place where you want to see them getting on with their life come on you just know this is it this is what's happened this is the lord's doings and we're just looking forward to being able to get on and live their life for jesus christ for him only because he's the only one worthy he is the only one worthy so how many of you will pray this week for michael and crystalline they need your prayers do you need our prayers i loved the look on both of their faces that was priceless i wish the camera could have zoomed in on them they need our prayers well you got them you got them we commit we're going to pray god's presence is going to be here and he's going to seal that marriage and we're believing that you all will do great things for the lord jesus you are dismissed to go in the wonderful name of the lord but if you need special prayer you can come and we'll be glad to pray for you god bless you as you leave sing something as we as we just come together to to go hallelujah it's already done yes [Music] oh it's already done [Music] the battle is over and victories [Music] is over and victory is one it's already done
