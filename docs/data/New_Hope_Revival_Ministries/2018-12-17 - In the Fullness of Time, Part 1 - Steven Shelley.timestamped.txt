[0:02] [Music]
[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right I Christ
[0:43] in you the hope award
[0:45] [Music]
[0:59] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley from
[1:02] New Hope revival ministries in Smith
[1:05] Station Alabama and I'm coming to you
[1:07] again today in partnership with our
[1:10] wonderful friends at the gospel channel
[1:13] and we appreciate the privilege that the
[1:15] Lord has given us to come to you week
[1:18] after week telling the best news there
[1:22] is no better news than the gospel of the
[1:25] Lord Jesus Christ it's the good news but
[1:28] it's the great news we're just so very
[1:31] thankful that we have the light the
[1:34] light of the world Jesus Yeshua our
[1:36] Messiah has come I know a lot of people
[1:40] around this time of year they like to
[1:43] celebrate Christmas and they like to
[1:46] spend a lot of money and they like to
[1:49] run two parties here and there and for
[1:52] many people it's a very enjoyable time
[1:54] of the year but I wonder sometimes when
[1:57] God looks at it I wonder how he feels I
[2:00] wonder what he thinks about how people
[2:03] have so commercialized this time of year
[2:06] while often trying to make it about his
[2:10] coming I want you to know more
[2:12] importantly than you celebrating the
[2:15] birth of Jesus Christ
[2:16] in fact the scripture actually gives us
[2:19] no indication that that's something that
[2:21] we should remember although we are so
[2:24] very thankful for his coming for his
[2:27] precious birth every day the Bible
[2:30] actually tells us that we should
[2:32] celebrate his death and his resurrection
[2:34] and we do that we celebrate his birth we
[2:39] celebrate his death and his resurrection
[2:41] not with our parties not with our
[2:44] exchanging gifts not by borrowing
[2:47] customs and traditions from pagans of
[2:50] long ago but we do that by living a life
[2:54] of sacrifice of consecration and
[2:59] Thanksgiving we have so much to be
[3:02] thankful for not just around this time
[3:05] of year but every day of our lives
[3:08] I think there's great
[3:09] eight victory and great success in
[3:12] living a life with an attitude of
[3:14] gratitude I know for myself I'm human
[3:18] just like all of you who are watching
[3:20] this program and I have those emotional
[3:23] roller coasters that some of you are so
[3:25] familiar with and when I get to that
[3:28] place where I just feel blue or heavy or
[3:31] down maybe slightly depressed if I can
[3:36] take a few moments to begin to look at
[3:39] my life and what God has given me I have
[3:42] a beautiful wife who I love very much
[3:45] and who has loved me in a way that I
[3:47] didn't think possible and I have four
[3:50] wonderful children I'm blessed with
[3:52] amazing friends I have a wonderful
[3:54] church family I have a very dedicated
[3:57] staff who love the Lord with all of
[4:00] their hearts and who labor for the
[4:03] kingdom of God in such a sacrificial way
[4:06] who stand with me in the victories and
[4:09] in the defeats and I'm blessed I just
[4:12] start going down you know maybe if I
[4:15] have some sickness or a little bit of
[4:18] maybe a new ache or pain you know and
[4:21] you start feeling sorry for yourself you
[4:23] look around and you see people who are
[4:25] suffering and you pray for them and yet
[4:29] there's something in your heart that
[4:30] says Lord I may not feel the best today
[4:33] but I am so grateful and I'm so thankful
[4:36] for how you have touched me and
[4:39] strengthened me and helped me and my
[4:41] life looks a whole lot easier than many
[4:43] of the lives of the people that I I see
[4:46] around me you just start reflecting on
[4:49] how good god has been I don't have a big
[4:53] fancy home to live in we live in a small
[4:55] three-bedroom home our boys share a
[4:58] bedroom our girls share a bedroom but
[5:00] it's warm in the winter and and cool in
[5:03] the summer it's everything we need
[5:06] that's the goodness of God I have a
[5:09] fairly comfortable bed I have plenty of
[5:11] clothes to wear you can tell that I have
[5:14] plenty to eat much more than I need God
[5:17] has been good to me you see you just
[5:20] start looking over your life that way
[5:23] and you feel yourself being lifted its
[5:26] his grace
[5:27] it's his mercy it's his love so no
[5:30] matter how you choose to celebrate
[5:32] during this time of year I implore you
[5:36] in fact I beg you in the name of the
[5:38] Lord don't leave Jesus out of your lives
[5:42] don't leave him out of your celebration
[5:45] and your Thanksgiving when you sit down
[5:48] to a meal and you enjoy the good food
[5:51] and the fellowship of your friends and
[5:53] your loved ones remember that it is all
[5:56] by the grace of God it is by the grace
[5:59] of God that we have what we have and he
[6:02] deserves the highest praise and I think
[6:05] we ought to give that to him not just in
[6:07] one particular season or a couple of
[6:10] seasons of the year but but every day
[6:12] this is the day that the Lord has made
[6:16] let us rejoice and be glad in it just a
[6:20] few days ago we had a stretch of gloomy
[6:23] weather here at home this is the month
[6:27] of December and it can be very warm in
[6:30] the day yet and very cool at night
[6:34] sometimes we have rainy spells and we
[6:37] were going through quite a rainy spell
[6:39] and it was quite cold and my children
[6:42] were complaining a little bit oh I would
[6:44] just surely love to see the sunshine
[6:46] well I agree
[6:47] I like the sunshine myself but I just
[6:50] said to the children but remember this
[6:53] this is the day that the Lord has made
[6:56] sunny rainy gloomy cold too hot whatever
[7:01] it is it's the day that the Lord has
[7:04] made and that gives us a reason to
[7:06] rejoice and a reason to celebrate I want
[7:10] you to know the world was in a terrible
[7:13] condition once upon a time with no hope
[7:16] today the world is in a terrible
[7:19] condition but I want you to know we have
[7:22] all the hope we have the hope above all
[7:25] hopes because we have the assurance and
[7:29] the confidence in knowing that Jesus has
[7:33] loved us Yeshua our Messiah
[7:36] has paid the ultimate price on our
[7:39] behalf and by His grace we are saved
[7:44] he has shed his blood he has healed our
[7:47] bodies he has lifted up our heads when
[7:51] we couldn't lift him up hold him up
[7:53] ourselves he's a very very good God he
[7:57] is an ever-present help in the time of
[8:01] need so I I wish you a wonderful season
[8:05] of love and fellowship with those you
[8:09] love however you choose to celebrate it
[8:12] at my house my family my
[8:15] great-grandparents were Lithuanian Jews
[8:18] we feel compelled to light the menorah
[8:21] at this time of the year to remember the
[8:25] the miracle to remember that God is a
[8:28] miracle working God we celebrate the
[8:31] fact that during this season the altar
[8:34] of the Holy Temple was rededicated after
[8:38] it had been so desecrated by the enemies
[8:42] of Israel and how God provides and we
[8:47] use this as an opportunity to rededicate
[8:50] our hearts to him to remember that he is
[8:53] the light every time we light the candle
[8:56] we remember it's because of you
[8:59] Yeshua Lord Jesus Christ you are the
[9:03] light
[9:04] whatever your holiday tradition looks
[9:07] like again I pray that you can enjoy
[9:12] your family you can enjoy the food and
[9:15] the festivity that goes with it but I
[9:18] pray that you will use this season as an
[9:21] opportunity to recon secrete and
[9:23] rededicate your life to Him he has been
[9:27] so good and he is so good to us
[9:31] thank you for your prayer requests for
[9:34] your phone calls of encouragement I get
[9:38] really blessed we've even had people
[9:40] call and say I need DVDs and I need to
[9:45] have some audio recordings because I am
[9:48] so blessed that
[9:49] to be able to listen to it whenever I
[9:52] want to whenever I need to and that's
[9:55] encouraging to us and let me remind you
[9:58] you can do that without a DVD without a
[10:00] CD you can visit our YouTube page and on
[10:04] that page you can subscribe and you will
[10:07] be notified of any additional material
[10:10] in fact all of the programs that we do
[10:13] for the gospel channel are available 24
[10:16] hours a day seven days a week at your at
[10:19] your convenience you can go and watch
[10:22] them or listen to them and there are
[10:24] some songs and some other programs that
[10:28] I believe would inspire you and bless
[10:30] you and it gives us another way to be
[10:33] connected I want to say as always it's a
[10:36] joy to pray with you about your needs to
[10:40] believe God and we don't mind doing it
[10:42] we feel like it's a pleasure and it's an
[10:45] honor to put our faith together with
[10:47] yours but I'll tell you what I really
[10:50] like I really like when that phone call
[10:53] comes back or an email comes back and
[10:56] says the Lord has heard and answered
[11:00] prayer I'm feeling better or I got a
[11:03] good report at the doctor thank you for
[11:05] praying or I see some changes in my
[11:08] loved ones that I've asked you all to
[11:10] pray with me about that is super
[11:13] encouraging and I want to thank you for
[11:16] taking the time to reach out again and
[11:18] let us know that God is answering prayer
[11:21] once again he is a prayer answering God
[11:26] to sort of commemorate or to remember
[11:30] this time of year that is so vitally
[11:33] important to so many people around the
[11:36] world and I think many people celebrate
[11:39] the Christmas season just it's just
[11:42] become a wonderful secular tradition and
[11:44] many people have no idea why they do it
[11:49] they've just been doing it for so long
[11:51] and and then there are others who
[11:54] sincerely use this time of year as an
[11:57] opportunity to say an extra thank you to
[12:00] God for sending his only bee
[12:02] gotten Sun and so to sort of look at
[12:06] this season with you I want to go to the
[12:09] scriptures and I want to share with you
[12:11] some thoughts that the Lord has given me
[12:14] concerning the hour that we're living in
[12:17] and how that every bit of this was in
[12:21] the mind of God before the foundation of
[12:23] the world he knew about it all and he
[12:26] planned a way of escape remember I told
[12:29] you that 2,000 years ago the world was
[12:32] in terrible shape without any hope and
[12:35] then Hope showed up hope was born in a
[12:39] little manger there's no doubt in my
[12:42] mind that that was the gift of God to
[12:44] the earth and so we can say today the
[12:48] world is again in great turmoil around
[12:51] us but thanks be to God we still have
[12:54] the hope the hope that was brought to us
[12:58] when God Himself the Living Word of God
[13:03] became flesh and dwelt among us this is
[13:07] the good news and I want to share a
[13:10] little of it with you today and I want
[13:12] to start in the newer Testament in the
[13:15] New Testament in the book of Galatians
[13:17] chapter 4 maybe if you're in your living
[13:21] room there you you have your Bible
[13:23] sitting beside you maybe you'll just
[13:25] pick it up and and read along with me
[13:27] and if not you'll see some of it on the
[13:30] screen I want to read beginning in verse
[13:33] 1 Galatians 4 now I say that the air as
[13:38] long as he is a child differeth nothing
[13:41] from a servant though he be Lord of all
[13:46] but is under tutors and governors until
[13:50] the time appointed of the Father even so
[13:56] we when we were children were in bondage
[14:00] under the elements of the world but when
[14:05] the fullness of the time was come what a
[14:10] phrase when the fullness of the time
[14:15] was come listen at what happened God
[14:19] sent forth his son made of a woman made
[14:25] under the law to redeem them that were
[14:30] under the law that we might receive the
[14:34] adoption of sons and because ye are sons
[14:40] God hath sent forth the spirit of his
[14:44] son into your hearts crying Abba Father
[14:50] it's like saying papa wherefore thou art
[14:55] no more a servant but a son and if a son
[15:01] then an heir of God through Christ I
[15:06] want you to know the news just doesn't
[15:09] get any better than Galatians 4 verses 1
[15:13] through 7 I'm so grateful to understand
[15:17] that God had a plan approximately 4,000
[15:22] years of history was on the other side
[15:26] of the fullness of the time God had a
[15:30] plan from the beginning it wasn't four
[15:34] thousand years of nothingness it wasn't
[15:37] four thousand years of aimless wandering
[15:41] around on planet Earth in fact God was
[15:45] very very connected with his children
[15:49] from the beginning from the Garden of
[15:52] Eden and we see that as the first five
[15:56] books of the Bible referred to as the
[15:58] Torah when we see in that history of the
[16:02] creation and in the origin the the the
[16:07] beginnings of God's dealings with man on
[16:11] the earth and we follow that through the
[16:13] kings and the Chronicles and we hear of
[16:17] the victories and the exploits of those
[16:20] who trusted in God it seems like from
[16:23] the very beginning the enemy had raised
[16:26] up
[16:28] and would continue to do so throughout
[16:30] history to try and come against the
[16:34] promises of God
[16:35] the purposes of God in the lives of his
[16:38] children but in every one of those
[16:42] situations in every one of those
[16:44] conflicts God has a victory he has a
[16:48] champion he has someone who will be
[16:51] steadfast and faithful sometimes it's
[16:55] men of great intelligence but not always
[16:58] sometimes it's men of great physical
[17:02] strength and stamina but not always
[17:05] you see God can use anyone and everyone
[17:10] who is willing to surrender and to yield
[17:14] of themselves what they have to give you
[17:18] see God doesn't have to have any
[17:20] particular man with a particular core
[17:24] strength or talent he knows how when he
[17:28] was creating us you see I believe and
[17:31] will share with you in the scripture
[17:33] that he knew about us
[17:35] way before we were ever born on planet
[17:38] Earth and I believe in giving us a
[17:41] prefix destiny he provided everything we
[17:44] need it may not look like someone else's
[17:47] provision but I believe that he provided
[17:50] for us everything we need to do His
[17:53] perfect will while we sojourn here on
[17:56] planet Earth remember friend this is not
[17:59] the end everything that goes on in our
[18:02] lives today everything that swirls
[18:05] around you today is temporal but there
[18:09] is an eternity with God and if we finish
[18:13] this race holding on to Jesus Christ
[18:16] being washed in his blood
[18:19] baptized in his name filled with his
[18:23] Holy Spirit then life is just beginning
[18:26] for us when they perhaps place us in
[18:30] that box and lay this body in the ground
[18:33] that's the end of our sojourn in time
[18:37] but that is not the end of who we are
[18:41] because there's something on the inside
[18:43] of us that is eternal that will never
[18:47] pass away I think we read in scripture
[18:50] where the riders have said you know this
[18:53] body returns back to the dust back to
[18:56] the skin worms and that's where they
[18:58] find their nourishment but that's not
[19:01] who you are this is just the temporary
[19:04] house that we're living in
[19:06] until that hour that we step out of time
[19:09] and into eternity
[19:11] into the very presence of God so cheer
[19:14] on brother sister be encouraged and know
[19:18] that what we experience here on earth is
[19:22] just for a season for a moment life is
[19:25] like the vapor that appears on the glass
[19:29] maybe you wake up on a frosty morning
[19:31] and you see that moisture running down
[19:34] the outside of the window but you let
[19:36] the Sun come up and it dries up the
[19:38] vapor off of the glass life is just as
[19:42] temporal it's that moisture that runs
[19:45] down the window pane but thanks be to
[19:50] God that's the life here on earth
[19:53] that's the earthly life the temporal
[19:56] life but there is an eternity the only
[20:00] way to have eternal life is to have a
[20:03] relationship with Jesus Christ that's
[20:06] what these scriptures tell us the world
[20:09] was moving forward and life was going
[20:12] forward started in the garden but then
[20:15] there was great progression we read of
[20:18] great advancements we read of God's
[20:22] goodness to the people we read of how
[20:24] they forgot God we read about the flood
[20:27] there there's so many things that we
[20:29] read about God always pursuing man
[20:32] always reaching out to save to rescue to
[20:37] help
[20:37] and what did hard-headed men do what do
[20:41] we do what do we hard-headed men do we
[20:45] try to figure it out on our own even as
[20:48] they did in the Old Testament and we see
[20:51] they paid a great price oftentimes
[20:55] for their rebellion and for their
[20:57] wickedness but we can follow that
[21:00] scarlet thread of redemption we can
[21:04] start in the Garden of Eden and we see
[21:07] that God had a plan I want you to know
[21:11] today God has a plan he's not standing
[21:16] in heaven watching over the earth to see
[21:19] what's about to happen so he can figure
[21:21] out what to do next
[21:23] no sir that's you and I we're kind of
[21:26] waiting to see what's gonna happen and
[21:28] trying to formulate a plan for what
[21:30] we're gonna do next in life but all we
[21:32] have a father we have a Heavenly Father
[21:35] and he's not trying to figure it all out
[21:38] he already has he already has it figured
[21:42] out he knows the end from the beginning
[21:45] he knows the beginning from tomorrow he
[21:48] knows all the way through eternity
[21:51] there's no limit to what he knows
[21:52] because there's no limit to eternity
[21:56] sometimes when I think about that it's
[22:00] too big for me to get my mind around
[22:02] I can hardly comprehend the the hugeness
[22:05] the bigness of God in fact sometimes he
[22:10] looks so big I wonder why he's even
[22:13] mindful of me but when I began to look
[22:17] at his interaction and his care his
[22:20] concern his provision in my life I am
[22:23] fully convinced that is big and vast as
[22:27] he is as powerful and all-knowing and
[22:30] all-loving and all-powerful omniscient I
[22:35] am convinced that he does see me he sees
[22:40] my life he sees my future
[22:44] he knows my tomorrows but he also he
[22:47] knows everything my yesterdays that's
[22:51] what I was looking for he knows by
[22:53] yesterday's he certainly knows my today
[22:56] and he knows by tomorrow when I can
[23:00] really get a hold of that it gives me a
[23:03] peace it gives me a place of rest
[23:06] we used to sing a song many years ago
[23:09] when I was a boy I don't know about
[23:13] tomorrow I just live for today there are
[23:18] so many things that I can figure out
[23:20] about tomorrow but I know may I may not
[23:24] know about tomorrow but I know who holds
[23:27] tomorrow you need to remember that when
[23:31] life gets tough when circumstances get
[23:34] ugly you need to come back and remember
[23:37] no it's true we as children of God on
[23:42] this earth we don't always know what
[23:44] tomorrow holds but we can rest assured
[23:47] in knowing who holds tomorrow and he's
[23:51] going to be with us tomorrow as he is
[23:55] with us today holding our hand if we
[23:58] need it
[23:59] swatting us on the on the backside if we
[24:04] need it lifting us up when we need it
[24:07] that's the God we serve I'm not going to
[24:11] tell you that there are not times that
[24:13] he has to get our attention because
[24:16] there there are times there are times
[24:19] that he has to bring a little discipline
[24:22] in our life and you know why because
[24:24] we're learning to be sons
[24:27] that's what Galatians is talking about
[24:30] in fact in verse 1 it says as long as he
[24:33] is a child
[24:34] he eats not differing much from a
[24:36] servant in the father's house though
[24:38] he's really Lord of all but he sits
[24:41] under tutors and governors and teachers
[24:44] he learns what it means to be a real son
[24:48] of the Father and that's what you and I
[24:51] are doing we are learning to be real
[24:54] sons of our Heavenly Father
[24:57] and we must understand that as real sons
[25:01] of our Heavenly Father we have both
[25:05] benefits blessings and we have
[25:09] responsibilities I'm just thankful I'm
[25:12] just so very thankful that everything he
[25:16] asked of us he so graciously provides
[25:19] the gray
[25:20] that we need to be obedient so I want
[25:23] you to know today that before the
[25:26] heavens were ever created before there
[25:28] was ever an earth before there were
[25:31] oceans and seas in the earth God had in
[25:36] his great big mind a blueprint not only
[25:41] for planet Earth but he had a blueprint
[25:45] full of his plans and his purposes for
[25:49] the earth and for every person that
[25:52] would ever be born on that planet as
[25:56] long as time would exist it's like an
[26:00] architect I don't know if you have ever
[26:03] seen an architect's drawings or not but
[26:07] it gets more detailed as you flip the
[26:09] pages oftentimes you get a set of
[26:12] blueprints and and on the first page at
[26:16] least the ones I've seen you have sort
[26:19] of the outside structure the overall
[26:21] view we could say the overview of the
[26:25] home or the church building or the
[26:27] office building whatever it is but as
[26:30] you flip the big pages and you begin to
[26:32] look it begins to break it down the
[26:36] electrical system the plumbing system
[26:39] why if you look carefully you can almost
[26:43] always see every place an electrical
[26:46] outlet it's going to go to plug in your
[26:49] appliances you can see where a closet is
[26:52] going to be where a bathroom is going to
[26:55] be where a stove or a washer and dryer
[26:58] is going to be placed because the
[27:01] connections have to be there and so
[27:04] things have to be prepared ahead of time
[27:06] so it seems that in a blueprint of an
[27:09] architect the more you keep turning
[27:12] pages the closer and the detail gets
[27:16] greater and you begin to learn the the
[27:19] little intricate ins and outs of this
[27:22] beautiful design well I want you to know
[27:25] that God knows all of that it's you and
[27:28] I that are turning pages it's you and I
[27:31] that are studying the blue
[27:33] which I would call it this this Bible is
[27:36] a blueprint this Bible is a written
[27:40] record of the word of God the Living
[27:44] Word of God has been captured for us in
[27:47] words on a page and I am so grateful for
[27:52] it because indeed it is a blueprint we
[27:56] can read it through at certain points in
[27:58] our life and we're getting an overview
[28:00] but when we begin to hunger when we
[28:03] begin to thirst when we begin to desire
[28:07] to know God not just to know about him
[28:11] but to know him in a place of
[28:14] relationship in a place of intimacy
[28:17] that's when we start flipping pages
[28:20] turning pages and that's when we can
[28:23] start examining those little verses of
[28:26] Scripture that we have read before but
[28:28] now the Holy Spirit of God wants to show
[28:31] you where the plug is going to go in the
[28:34] wall the Holy Spirit wants to show you
[28:37] where the closet is going to be where
[28:40] the outlets of the different connectors
[28:42] and all those little pieces of the
[28:46] puzzle all those details that's what
[28:49] happens in the Christian life the more
[28:52] we turn the pages the more we present
[28:55] ourselves to God in prayer the more we
[28:58] ask him for revelation I don't believe
[29:01] that revelation is automatic because you
[29:04] have invited Jesus into your life to
[29:07] forgive you of your sins
[29:08] I believe that revelation is something
[29:11] we ask for I believe it's something that
[29:13] we keep coming back to God and saying
[29:16] open my eyes Lord I want to see you I
[29:18] want to see you in every page of the
[29:21] blueprint I want to recognize you every
[29:25] time I turn a page I want to be able to
[29:28] identify it's really you in my life
[29:31] working for my good so God is the
[29:35] architect he's the master designer and
[29:38] he draws out the plans with specific
[29:41] details and functions all of these
[29:44] things
[29:44] begin to develop in the mind of God from
[29:47] the very beginning based on his design
[29:51] and plans thoughts that he has about
[29:55] planet Earth and about time and how it
[29:59] would progress he can draw out a picture
[30:02] of exactly what the finished product
[30:05] will look like and then someone is
[30:07] chosen who can make those drawings that
[30:09] represent ideas become a physical
[30:11] reality
[30:12] so sometimes it's I have a desire to
[30:15] have a home and so I hire an architect
[30:18] someone who can draw out the plans and
[30:21] make all the details then someone else
[30:23] comes along to do the building and to do
[30:26] the finishing so that old process can be
[30:29] quite time-consuming because sometimes
[30:32] you have to go back and say wait a
[30:33] minute that's not exactly how I wanted
[30:35] it well that's one good thing about our
[30:37] God he thought it in the beginning he
[30:41] formulated a plan for the salvation of
[30:45] mankind he drew that plan and he is
[30:49] executing that plan and he never had to
[30:53] go back and say oops I didn't see that
[30:56] coming now I've got to erase something
[30:59] here and I've got to correct it here and
[31:01] make it a little different because
[31:03] circumstances won't allow it to be the
[31:05] way I own oh you see we're talking about
[31:08] a God who knew the end from the
[31:10] beginning in the beginning Oh
[31:14] so the design that God had for the earth
[31:17] in the beginning was perfect
[31:19] you say what about Lucifer what about
[31:22] sin what about murder
[31:24] what about evil what about all the
[31:27] things we read about in the Old
[31:28] Testament what about what we see going
[31:31] on today well this may not have been
[31:33] pleasing to God but God knew it he saw
[31:38] it he knew exactly how the enemy would
[31:41] raise up he knew how Lucifer's ambition
[31:45] would lead to a great darkness that
[31:48] would enter into men's hearts but again
[31:51] all of that a part of God's master
[31:54] design because he wanted to have
[31:57] fellowship with you and I he didn't just
[32:02] want to live above us he didn't want to
[32:04] just walk with us but ultimately God the
[32:09] God of eternity the God of Abraham Isaac
[32:13] and Jacob that God wanted to live inside
[32:18] of us and part of that great big master
[32:22] plan part of everything that God wanted
[32:26] to accomplish in the end you're a part
[32:28] of that you're involved in that and
[32:31] we're seeing these things begin to draw
[32:34] to a final curtain call we know that
[32:38] according to the scripture the end time
[32:41] began when Jesus was manifested when he
[32:45] was born in the earth that started the
[32:49] end time well here we are two thousand
[32:52] years living in the end times and so
[32:57] what we often say is this it's not just
[33:00] the end time anymore
[33:02] we see scriptures being fulfilled very
[33:05] very often now I mean sometimes you have
[33:10] to really look deep to see what God is
[33:13] saying when you do by revelation you
[33:17] find that it just fits the word that
[33:19] what you see going on in the news and in
[33:21] the world around you just fits the word
[33:23] it describes what God already knew about
[33:25] the hour that we're living in and as
[33:28] this plan unfolds we can now say we're
[33:31] living in the end of the end times
[33:34] and it's very very important for you to
[33:37] make Jesus the Lord of your life he's
[33:41] not just someone to have when you need
[33:44] him I want you to know God it's not just
[33:47] good when you need him God is good all
[33:50] the time he is a faithful faithful
[33:53] friend if you'll allow him to come into
[33:56] your life by the power of the Holy
[33:58] Spirit
[33:59] remember he wants to walk in you he
[34:01] wants to live in you and so this great
[34:04] architect this great design that God had
[34:08] the blue
[34:09] that God had in his mind from the
[34:10] beginning he could have done it quickly
[34:13] he could have D could have accomplished
[34:15] it in in one hour had he so desired but
[34:19] he allowed in such a way that it would
[34:22] take a a span of time and that God would
[34:27] reveal himself in every generation in a
[34:31] deeper and a deeper and a deeper way
[34:34] until one day the fullness of the time
[34:39] would come and when the fullness of the
[34:43] time would come somewhere around four
[34:47] thousand years after creation when that
[34:51] day came when that moment came that time
[34:54] was full and everything was in order for
[34:58] God to really begin what we could say
[35:02] the final act the final chapter in God's
[35:06] great book even though we said this
[35:09] started 2000 years ago I think it's very
[35:12] appropriate to call it the last chapter
[35:15] and in that last chapter here's what we
[35:19] see God sent forth his son made of a
[35:27] woman made under the law to redeem them
[35:31] that were under the law that we might
[35:34] receive the adoption of sons I'm telling
[35:40] you God is a good God he is a faithful
[35:42] god when we when we you know start
[35:46] pondering and meditating on these things
[35:49] on the omniscience of God that he has
[35:54] all knowledge that he's all-knowing that
[35:58] he knew from eternity to eternity then
[36:03] it's hard to sometimes compare time with
[36:07] eternity time was also created by God
[36:11] for the purposes of eternity there was
[36:16] eternity before there was time do you
[36:18] understand that
[36:19] and when we look at the word time in the
[36:23] Bible there are several different Hebrew
[36:26] words and Greek words that are used that
[36:30] we see in our Bible translated simply as
[36:35] the word time one of those words is
[36:38] Chronos time and that means like a space
[36:42] of time a period of time with an action
[36:46] and a process a plan or a purpose occurs
[36:49] and that Chronos time is measured by an
[36:53] evening and a morning and when you take
[36:57] an evening and a morning the Bible said
[37:00] you have a day you want to chop this
[37:02] down Genesis 1:5 and God called the
[37:05] light day and the darkness he called
[37:08] night and the evening and the morning
[37:11] were the first day
[37:13] that's Chronos time that's the kind of
[37:17] time that we observe by looking at our
[37:20] watch or checking the calendar Chronos
[37:25] expresses a duration of time passing a
[37:30] quantity of time then there's a word
[37:34] that is used and it is a Greek word and
[37:38] kahin Rose sometimes you hear it a
[37:42] pronounced Kairos time kahin Rose time
[37:47] is a little bit different than Chronos
[37:49] time you know we we are pretty sure how
[37:52] Chronos time works we have we have 60
[37:57] seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an
[37:59] hour we have 24 hours in a day we have
[38:04] 12 months of the year we have seven days
[38:06] in a week we're pretty sure that's how
[38:09] things are going to take on for sometime
[38:11] now right but this car hero's time or
[38:15] Kairos time it's a different kind of
[38:19] time it can run in conjunction with
[38:22] Chronos time gods seasons can actually
[38:29] run congruently with Chronos time
[38:32] absolutely
[38:34] his Sabbath is a a spiritual expression
[38:40] the Sabbath is an expression of God's
[38:43] rest but we can mark the Sabbath the
[38:47] same way that any other day is marked
[38:49] from sunset until the Sun is setting and
[38:54] then all the way through sunrise the
[38:57] evening and the morning are the first
[39:00] day so from sunset to sunset
[39:05] so that's Chronos but the Sabbath is not
[39:10] only Chronos but it's also kahin rose
[39:13] because that is a portion of time that
[39:16] God says I want to refresh you I want to
[39:19] restore you I want to renew you not only
[39:23] in body but also in mind so this Chi
[39:26] hero's time it seems to be a time of a
[39:29] season a cycle of heightened spiritual
[39:33] activity sometimes people will speak
[39:38] about seasons of revival maybe we talk
[39:42] about the great healing revival the
[39:45] voice of healing revival it's kind of
[39:48] hard to pin down exactly the moment it
[39:52] began exactly the moment it ended
[39:54] because it was a kahin rose time a
[40:00] god-ordained moment and this fullness of
[40:04] time it was it was marked in the Chronos
[40:11] but it was more of a spiritual timing
[40:16] when everything that God was waiting on
[40:20] he allowed it to just develop and flow
[40:24] and go forward all in his purpose all in
[40:28] his plan and on that day when everything
[40:33] was in order that the word was going to
[40:37] become flesh it was always God's mind
[40:40] always in his mind and always his
[40:43] purpose to come down in a body made of
[40:46] flesh
[40:47] we call it the condescension but it
[40:50] could not happen until everything else
[40:54] that God had purpose to happen to set
[40:57] the stage to make sure that every detail
[41:01] was in place so that it would have the
[41:03] maximum impact he waited for tyrants to
[41:07] rise and fall he waited on many
[41:10] variables that all had to just sort of
[41:13] begin to pen out and then that moment
[41:15] came in the fullness of the time God
[41:20] sent forth and how did he do that he did
[41:22] that by stepping out of eternity and
[41:26] into time what a plan what a plan maybe
[41:33] sometimes in your life you feel like
[41:35] you're tumbling you've fallen off the
[41:38] edge and you're just tumbling sometimes
[41:41] your head is up sometimes your heads
[41:43] down and your feet are up you're just
[41:45] tumbling out of control
[41:48] no plan for your life not knowing what
[41:52] your tomorrow holds I understand that
[41:55] feeling I know that that can be most
[41:58] overwhelming and it can even make you
[42:01] question whether you want to spend
[42:03] another day in this life but I want you
[42:08] to know that in that moment that you're
[42:10] tumbling out of control in that moment
[42:13] when it feels like nothing makes sense
[42:15] and there's going to be no way out of
[42:18] the confucian and the circumstances that
[42:21] surround you even in that moment I want
[42:24] you to know God knows he sees he may not
[42:32] like what's going on in your life it may
[42:36] not be of his creation he may not have
[42:41] created the circumstances that you're in
[42:43] in fact oftentimes we create our
[42:47] circumstances by decisions that we make
[42:50] but boy can that make us feel lonely
[42:54] when we get down in the in the pit and
[42:56] we're tumbling around so God may have
[43:00] not create
[43:00] did those circumstances but he's aware
[43:03] of them and he sees the way out he knew
[43:09] before you got here
[43:11] that you were gonna make like me some
[43:14] dumb choices along the way and in his
[43:18] sovereignty in his beautiful mind he
[43:22] knew there would be a way out
[43:24] he allowed things to to ebb and flow to
[43:29] fall into place in other words he's
[43:33] already seen your deliverance if you're
[43:36] sick right now and oppressed in body
[43:38] God's already seen your healing if
[43:41] you're bound and you can't break free
[43:44] something has taken ahold of your life
[43:47] and you don't seem to be able to break
[43:49] out of that bit I want you to know God
[43:51] has already seen your deliverance in
[43:54] fact it could be that this program today
[43:58] is an opportunity for you to make a
[44:01] giant step toward your deliverance by
[44:05] hearing this little gospel message and
[44:07] by calling on the name of the Lord their
[44:11] salvation
[44:12] there's deliverance there's healing
[44:15] there's hope there's peace in calling on
[44:20] the name of the Lord so no matter what
[44:23] our circumstances are right now God knew
[44:25] them he saw them you may feel like
[44:28] Chronos time is just ticking along and
[44:31] things are never going to get better for
[44:33] you but I want you to know there's
[44:34] another kind of time God has an
[44:37] appointed time there's an appointed
[44:40] season when the circumstances of your
[44:43] life reach their fullness and God says
[44:47] enough is enough it's time to launch you
[44:50] into the next chapter of what he has for
[44:53] you I'm gonna trust him I don't know
[44:55] about you but I'm gonna put my trust in
[44:58] him he's got a proven track record I
[45:01] can't ever remember a time that he's
[45:03] failed I can remember times that I have
[45:06] failed him but I can never remember a
[45:09] time that he failed me now let me be
[45:12] fair and say that I can
[45:14] member times that he came through at the
[45:18] last millisecond in that last moment
[45:23] when it felt like time was up it's over
[45:28] this is it
[45:29] and God stepped in I was nervous but he
[45:33] was never nervous
[45:35] in fact I didn't have the courage to
[45:38] ever say Lord you're late because God's
[45:41] timing is always right it might have
[45:45] felt late in my plans the way I was
[45:48] looking at things but in his plan in his
[45:51] great big beautiful mind
[45:53] it was the fullness of time it was the
[45:56] particularly is enough I am stepping in
[46:03] to those circumstances and into those
[46:05] details and I feel like there are people
[46:08] watching this program right now you know
[46:10] what I'm talking about I'm not teaching
[46:13] you something you don't know you know
[46:15] how God can show up in the nick of time
[46:18] because he's done that in your life so
[46:21] be encouraged you found yourself in
[46:24] another set of of depressing
[46:26] circumstances but be encouraged because
[46:30] as God broke through for you in the past
[46:33] he is more than able to break through
[46:37] for you again I am putting my trust in
[46:41] him everything has to come to its place
[46:45] of fruition to its place of fulfillment
[46:49] and then it often kicks in another level
[46:54] another installment of what God wants to
[46:57] do in the earth so to summarize just a
[47:00] moment 4000 years of time moving on
[47:04] God didn't step away he was always
[47:07] visiting man through the prophets
[47:10] through the through the worshipers of
[47:12] the Book of Psalms we we just see God
[47:15] constantly desiring to interact with his
[47:18] creation but after four thousand years a
[47:22] span of God's unfolding purposes and
[47:25] plans time got fool
[47:28] and God said it's time to go to the next
[47:30] chapter
[47:31] and how did he do that he did that by
[47:34] coming down by condescending by the word
[47:39] becoming flesh by God choosing to be
[47:43] born can you imagine that God who always
[47:46] was the God who always has been that god
[47:51] of eternity would now decide to be born
[47:55] to come into the womb of a little Jewish
[47:59] Maiden
[47:59] a virgin girl never touched by a man and
[48:02] God would come in to that little womb
[48:05] and he would manifest in fact he would
[48:09] create his own body he would create a
[48:11] physical body that the deity of God
[48:15] could dwell in that's how much he loved
[48:19] planet Earth for God so loved the world
[48:23] that He gave His only begotten Son that
[48:26] whosoever believeth in him should not
[48:28] perish but have everlasting life for God
[48:33] sent not his son into the world to
[48:35] condemn the world but that through him
[48:37] the world might be saved this is the
[48:41] good news and it's not just the good
[48:44] news in December this is the good news
[48:47] in January this is a good news in July
[48:51] it's the good news in August this isn't
[48:55] the good news that is specifically tied
[48:57] to one day of the year that we sometimes
[49:01] like to say the birthday of Jesus Christ
[49:05] I see people saying things like happy
[49:08] birthday Jesus I want you to know he's
[49:11] bigger than a birthday he is he's from
[49:14] eternity he only stepped into time for a
[49:19] period and then he steps back into
[49:22] eternity and beckons you and I to come
[49:27] to eternity where he is
[49:29] that's the Blessed hope that we have
[49:33] revelation chapter 10 verse 6 and swear
[49:39] by him that liveth for ever and ever
[49:41] who created heaven and the things that
[49:43] therein are and the earth and the things
[49:46] that therein are and the sea and the
[49:47] things which are therein that there
[49:50] should be time no longer this is a a
[49:54] word that is spoken prophetically about
[49:58] an hour when there will be no more delay
[50:02] when the last installment that last
[50:05] little cycle that God has already
[50:09] determined in his mind he saw it from
[50:13] eternity I believe that last work that
[50:19] God wants to do in planet Earth is in
[50:21] the racing up of Suns we can say that we
[50:26] love the Lord we can say that we that
[50:30] we're Christians some people say I was
[50:32] born a Christian I don't particularly
[50:35] believe that theology you may have been
[50:37] born again a Christian but I don't think
[50:40] we're born into this world born again
[50:43] we're born into this world we come here
[50:47] having been shapen in iniquity and
[50:49] formed in sin we need a savior but thank
[50:53] God we have one if we can see him if we
[50:58] can call on him if we recognize that he
[51:01] is as close as the prayer of repentance
[51:05] he wants to come in and do everything
[51:08] that we need him to do so
[51:11] Cronos time k heroes time hard a time
[51:16] which is another word that's expressed
[51:18] for a definite fixed a period or
[51:22] measurement of time or season a natural
[51:26] law it's the same kind of progression as
[51:29] Chronos time all of those kinds of time
[51:34] expressions of time there's coming an
[51:37] hour when they are no more when the God
[51:41] who created time will cause us all to
[51:45] step completely away from time into the
[51:48] dimension of eternity and like so many
[51:51] other things that are a part of our life
[51:55] that will not be a part of our life and
[51:57] eternity time is one of them we just we
[51:59] just slip away from it I'm telling you
[52:02] never to be weary never to be tired
[52:04] never to be sick never to say goodbye
[52:07] never to shed a tear someone said I just
[52:11] really can't believe that there is a
[52:14] place like that there is a state of
[52:19] being like that brother sister you have
[52:23] to believe you have to believe the other
[52:27] alternative is not worth mentioning you
[52:31] have to believe when you look around the
[52:34] world that we have right now and there's
[52:37] no way in the world you can watch this
[52:40] program today and and look around and
[52:43] see the world and say oh I just I
[52:46] believe it's all all just some kind of
[52:48] spontaneous process that got us here
[52:53] single-cell amoeba divided itself this
[52:58] way in that way and and and the next
[53:00] thing you know crawled out of the mud
[53:02] hole and now has become a nuclear
[53:08] physicist listen there's no way in the
[53:12] world that we are where we are in
[53:14] technology there's no way we could be
[53:17] where we are today apart from a divine
[53:22] creator apart from divine intelligence
[53:26] that allowed us to be where we are today
[53:30] and I'm going to when I recognize that
[53:33] I'm not here by accident I'm here as
[53:36] part of a divine design that makes me
[53:40] want to know how do I cooperate with the
[53:43] divine design how do I cooperate with
[53:46] that divine creator because if he can do
[53:48] all of this then he can do everything
[53:51] the book says he can do he can go to
[53:54] prepare a place for me that where he is
[53:57] I will one day be with him absent from
[54:01] all time only eternity only peace with
[54:06] him stress is
[54:08] it's a major factor in almost every
[54:10] person's life you may live a very simple
[54:13] life and still have those moments of
[54:16] great stress and strain so much
[54:20] responsibility and I want you to know
[54:23] that the only relief that I know the
[54:27] only relief that I have ever found I
[54:29] mean I I love gardening and I love being
[54:33] out in the Sun and I love you know
[54:35] enjoying nature there's a lot of things
[54:38] I enjoy but but but you can if you're
[54:40] not careful you can take your stress
[54:42] with you but what brings me the most
[54:45] peace is when I start meditating and
[54:48] reflecting on the goodness of God and
[54:51] his love for me what he means to me his
[54:56] proven track record in my own life I
[55:00] don't have to sit here today and tell
[55:02] you what only what I've read God did in
[55:06] the Bible or what I've heard that God
[55:09] did in the great healing revivals of of
[55:12] the last generation but I can sit here
[55:15] today and tell you I personally know the
[55:18] goodness of God in my own life he is
[55:22] more to me than the air that I breathe
[55:25] right now I know that He desires to be
[55:29] all of that in your life and he can only
[55:33] come in if you are willing to open up
[55:36] the door and let him in don't get so
[55:40] caught up in the trappings of any season
[55:44] of the year they often say around this
[55:47] time Jesus is the reason for the season
[55:50] let me tell you something
[55:52] Jesus is the reason for all seasons
[55:55] he's just the reason father I thank you
[56:00] today for the peace that comes in
[56:03] knowing you you have not placed us here
[56:06] on this earth and then turned your back
[56:09] on us but you are with us even in us by
[56:14] the power of the Holy Spirit and I pray
[56:17] for those watching this program today
[56:19] that they will also feel the sweetness
[56:22] of your presence that settled over me
[56:25] just a few moments ago I pray Lord
[56:28] somehow that in their home
[56:30] you would allow them to feel the
[56:33] sweetness of your presence and your love
[56:36] for them
[56:37] I pray O God but if they have closed the
[56:40] door in your face and not allowed you
[56:42] into their life that they would repent
[56:44] even now and invite you to come in and
[56:48] reveal your love and your plan and your
[56:52] purpose for their lives Lord if there's
[56:55] someone watching this right now that's
[56:57] tumbling as we described a few moments
[57:00] ago out of control and wondering whether
[57:04] or not another day on this earth is
[57:06] worth the living I pray right now in the
[57:10] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[57:13] that you would touch them where they are
[57:16] and let them know that life is not worth
[57:20] living without a savior but with a
[57:23] savior
[57:25] knowing you Lord makes life worth the
[57:30] living you will be there to help them
[57:34] through the circumstances of their life
[57:36] that have caused them to tumble may they
[57:40] invite you in may they connect with
[57:43] someone who can offer them guidance and
[57:47] help them on the journey of serving you
[57:51] with newness of life that they would not
[57:54] have to feel alone in this hour I ask
[57:57] this in the mighty name of the Lord
[58:00] Jesus Christ our Savior amen and amen
[58:04] god bless you you go and have an
[58:07] attitude of gratitude will you and we'll
[58:10] meet again here
[58:11] another time bye-bye for now
