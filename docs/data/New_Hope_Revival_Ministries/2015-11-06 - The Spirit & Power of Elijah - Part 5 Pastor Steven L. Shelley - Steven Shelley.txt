TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] oh [Music] [Music] praise the Lord this is the eagle cry and I'm Pastor step Shelly I thank you for watching this program today I pray that before our time is up that you will have experienced a word that would challenge you inspire you encourage you correct you if you need some correction I know I do sometime what whatever your needs are I'm asking that the Lord Jesus would come and minister to your need I want you to know that he is faithful and true uh I I came to the Lord when I was just a small child and uh my my grandmother was a woman of Faith uh my parents were not particularly people of Faith they they knew that God was real but had uh uh had turned my father had turned from the Lord my mother had never had a real experience with God uh a as a young person and so God was so faithful and so good to visit me in my life I I said it that way so you'd understand it wasn't the influence of my parents uh uh although my grandmother helped me in a great way it it wasn't her influence either that called me to the Lord he called me he sovereignly called me to serve him and uh I did so with with radical Faith uh I wished I could tell you that I've never disappointed the Lord and never failed him in anyway but that would not be honest uh I would have to tell you the truth I'm sure I have many times along the way uh I've been discouraged like most of you and I felt like giving up a time or two along the way but God gave me strength he wouldn't let me uh he gave me strength to Keep Holding On Through The Midnight Hour and uh he would meet me sometimes he didn't come when I wanted him to come but he always would come in his timing uh I think we underestimate sometime how long we can hold on and God knows better and he knows and he never misses an appointment he comes at just the right time to encourage us and to Lift Us my parents divorced when I was 5 years old and uh of course that changed my life you can you can imagine it it uh it gave a different direction to my life perhaps than the one I would have chosen if I would have been making the choice but in all of that God was good to me and when I was seven years old he had visited me already before I was seven but when I was 7 years old he baptized me with the Holy Ghost and Fire and it changed me forever and ever you experience the real baptism of the Holy Ghost and and it will certainly affect you it will certainly redirect uh everything about you and uh it certainly did I entered into public ministry right after that at 7 years old and as some of you know my testimony I started pastoring at the age of 17 so I've uh given my life for the Lord I'm not here trying to brag on my o on my degrees or my experience or anything like that I I just wanted you to know uh for some reason I felt like I should speak to somebody and I wanted you to know that this is uh not my business this is not my career this is my life's calling and I just feel like God is calling to someone out there will you lay down your life and surrender and serve the Lord maybe there's a child maybe there's a young person watching this program and God has been dealing with you and you think I'm just a kid what can I do listen remember now thy Creator in the days of your youth if he is calling you now even as a child even as a teen surrender yourself call on him Jesus have mercy on me and give me strength to follow you you may be a a man or woman of marrying age and God calling you surrender serve him you might be an elderly person already a senior most of your life behind you and the uncertainty of how much longer you have on this Earth and you feel like you've wasted your life and yet God's calling to you now serve him don't walk in shame or condemnation of the years that you have not served him and don't let that keep you from surrendering your life to him now go right ahead uh even at an elderly Place give him your life and see if God can't use you you've gained life experience I'm sure there's someone that you could influence that you could speak to and encourage along the way I guess what I'm trying to say is whoever you are under the sound of my voice won't you surrender and serve the Living God he calls to you today he's giving you once again another opportunity to say yes maybe you're a Christian already and yet you've just been getting by growing less faithful as the the days go by less committed we're talking about the spirit and power of Elijah and one of the things that Elijah the prophet did as we read about in the Bible he challenged normal everyday Christianity or we'll say religion because of course this was the faith given to Moses which we now call the faith of the Hebrews or or Judaism and they were getting slack they were they were certainly rejecting the Covenant that had been made just uh holding on to bael with one hand and the Living God with other hand and Elijah just challenged them and said it's time to make up your mind I want to I want to challenge you and say also make up your mind we are in a study here on the spirit and power of Elijah past present and future we're looking at the life of Elijah the prophet because we understand from Malachi's prophecy that that Same Spirit and same anointing that was on the life of Elijah would return to the Earth uh multiple times to accomplish the same kind of mission the reason for the return of that spirit is to uh prevent the Earth from a curse lest I smite the Earth with a curse and so God sends that Elijah Spirit to call men and women to repentance and it pushes that cursing of the earth further and further out into the future so I'm thankful for every time that the spirit and power of Elijah has returned to the Earth uh to give more grace to give an extended time of Mercy to an earth that really has deserved the curse deserve the judgments of God we talked about the fact that MOS Elijah was a man of the Wilderness we talked about the fact that he was not afraid to confront false religion or even just the religious complacency of his day number three I want you to know that according to the Bible Elijah demonstrated the raw power of God I wrote it down like this I don't know if you'll appreciate this phrase understand this in the Nations like we would here in America but I said no phone baloney that means he is the real deal he walked before God with integrity and with truth and I'd like to show you that in the newer Covenant James chap 5 verse 17 and 18 it says Elias that's Elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain and it rained not on the Earth by the space of 3 years and 6 months that's a long time to be Without Rain Verse 18 and he prayed again and the heaven gave rain and the Earth brought forth her fruit now this wasn't any ordinary man this was a man who knew his God knew him uh I think this goes beyond a knowledge into a knowing which is an intimate encounter with the Living God I want you to know that's what God wants to have with you he doesn't want to just know you uh through religion or you know him through religion he wants you to know him to be intimately acquainted with the god of the Bible who is still the Living God today and you can have that you can experience that without all the trappings and the tradition of religion you can come to God in faith and ask him to come into your life with fullness and with power and I believe that he'll hear your prayer I'd like to read uh James 5 again verse 17 and I think I have uh no just have verse 17 here in the Amplified Bible and it's a version of the Bible that I use sometime uh because it amplifies the meaning of some of the words and and makes it uh even easier to get a hold of and James 5:17 in the Amplified version of the Bible said Elijah was a human being with a nature such as we have you know we forget that sometime we read about these great men and even women of the Bible who walked with God who saw such Mighty demonstrations of the power of God and yet we can't relate to them because they're superheroes in our mind we we don't see them as ordinary human beings like us that God chose and made them superordinary you know they were superordinary but they started out as common vessels surrendered God chose them and when when God puts himself in the natural it becomes Supernatural That's the difference between the natural the supernatural uh common the ordinary and then you put God in it and it becomes extraordinary so here was Elijah a human being with nature such as we have with feelings affections and a constitution like ours that word constitution means will he had a will just like you and I do and you know sometimes that will of ours can get us in trouble we we have to keep taking our will and and sliding it under the Altar and saying Lord not my will but your will be done and he goes on to say and he prayed earnestly for it not to rain and no rain fell on the earth for three years and 6 months Elijah ordinary man like passions like emotions like feelings just like we have and yet a man of Supernatural power because he trusted in the Living God he didn't have to exaggerate the Miracles that took place in his meeting like we see happening sometime in the world he didn't have to uh try to make it sound bigger than it was so that he could build his mailing list or expand his television audience he was just the real deal what you saw is what you got he knew God he knew God and he was able to move that hand of God with his faith and and I want to be that kind of man I don't know about you he was genuine in every way there was no pretense about him he wasn't one way around one person and another way I believe he was just a man of consistency not perfect not a perfect man but a surrendered man and this is one of the reasons why we can't relate sometimes to the men and women of the Bible again as I said a moment ago we we don't see them as but that's why God lets a David be there my David was the apple of God's eye he was a a man beloved of God he failed God committed adultery then ended up committing murder to cover up his adultery and God didn't throw him out and and banish him to predition instead he made a way he sent a messenger he sent a prophet to correct his path and David learned the way back to God I want you to know if you've once known the Lord and walked in Intimate fellowship with him and you have fallen by the wayside and you think I could never get back to God I could never be where I was just as David look at the word of God concerning the life of the great King David hear him pouring out his heart of repentance before the Lord create in me a clean heart heart oh God renew a right Spirit Within Me Purge me cleanse me this was the rep uh the prayer of repentance that David prayed God must have heard him because he wasn't finished with David he continued to use him of course because of David's sins there are penalties he was not able to do all that was in his heart some of that Destiny passed down to the Next Generation in his line but you know what David said I I may not be able to physically be the one to build the temple of God the house of God but I can make it easier for the next generation and he began to gather the materials even though God said I'm not your hands are bloody David and I'm not going to let you build my house David could have gotten his feelings hurt over that but instead he said that's all right I I trust the Living God but I tell you what I'll do I'll gather the material I'll begin to get things in order so that when this next Generation comes on the scene uh he will be able to raise up the house of God without the bloody hands that I've had I love that about the character of David so you start looking through the Bible uh if you're focusing on the Miracles you'll see these Great Men of Might and power but if you want to look for a moment at the humanity this Bible is full of cracked Humanity flawed humanity and God didn't say there's nobody I can trust in the earth he took those moldable men and women that's the key that's the key when you can't be perfect be moldable be somebody God can deal with be someone who has a an ear to hear the correction of the Lord you know the Bible said that those who God loves he will chastise them he will punish them sometime uh I'm a father I have four wonderful children that I love with all my heart and a beautiful wife and we're so thankful for the children that God has given us but they disappoint us sometimes they don't do what we've asked them to do or what we expect of them and sometimes we have to bring discipline to their life but we don't stop loving them oh No in fact sometime you love them more because you know they need a little more love they need a little more physical connection to you and so you just draw them in a little bit closer you better not let them get away with it you better teach them as early as you can there are consequences for bad decisions there are consequences in life if you don't do the right thing but as a parent we don't love them any less we just believe that if we keep helping to shape them and point them in the right direction that they're going to do what's right the Bible tells us that that we should raise our children teach them the right way and when they're old they'll not depart from it that's a promise if you look at that in the original language it says that we should train up a child in the way he should go and while he is growing old he will not depart that means there will come a time of deep reflection in that life that boy or that girl that man that woman and during that time of deep contemplation they will remember praise God the way they were taught and the way they were raised and they'll have another opportunity to come and renew thems back to God but if you've been one that has failed the Lord he didn't love you less he didn't he didn't throw you away he just kept moving and working if you'll let him and if you've shut him out of your life because of your shame I encourage you right now open up the door again don't you shut out the one who gave himself for you just say Lord I really messed up I really failed you again but I plead with your mercy I come right back to you through Jesus and I ask that you will redeem me and restore me uh use me again for the kingdom you know I don't want to just be saved on a shelf I want to be redeemed and in the service of the Lord this Elijah he had all the Temptations that anyone else would have and yet he remained genuine to the Lord we saw right here that he had power to shut up the Heavens that they reain not open the Earth uh or to open the heavens so that it rain not upon the earth when we look in the Book of Revelation concerning that last individual who will operate in the spirit and power of Elijah we find out that he will also have the power to shut the heavens and the Earth so so I think we could say that any person any individual or any corporate body that operated in the spirit and power of Elijah they would have uh a real authority to do the work of God and sometimes that Authority would even uh give them uh the ability to shift things in nature if they needed to be shift to speak to the storm if the storm was hindering the plan of God the authority to speak to the storm Jesus did speak to that storm and the storm went on its way or perhaps speak to that tumor in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ and watch it disappear let me tell you something the supernatural God we serve has power over nature he created nature and his laws supersede the laws that he established in nature in other words the Supernatural is over the natural every time and so in the natural there are certain things that happen uh in the natural someone gets cancer and if they don't get treatment or healing it just keeps working and working and working until it brings death but by the power of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the atonement uh uh the suffering of of his death and the blood that was shed for our salvation and for our healing by that we can know healing for cancer we can see healing in that area I've watched God heal cancer multiple times he is more than able to unstop deaf ears to open blinded eyes he can heal the dreaded plague of AIDS whatever the condition is he has power to heal and power to save and how we need a company of men and women right now in the earth we certainly do that would go forth in that power and authority of the Lord Jesus Christ to deal with some things that need to be dealt with I I think you could probably say Amen to that Elijah also learned to discern that even the smallest sign could be speaking of a tremendous outpouring for instance remember when that when it came to the the cloud about the size of a man's hand and uh the servant that's all he could see was this tiny little Cloud but but what was the prophecy that was released the prophecy was that there was about to be an abundance of rain and so part of that Elijah uh anointing is the ability to watch for even the smallest sign that God sends and attach a greater significance to that than what ordinary men would in other words we want to celebrate even the smallest demonstration of God's power in our life if if he moves even in the smallest way I've seen God do amazing outstanding things uh bigger than the mind can nearly fathom but I want to thank him for the little Graces that he gives I want to thank him for every time I've called on him and he's moved a headache you know I know he can heal cancer but I want to thank him for the times that that that I had stomach pain and I said father I need you to come and move that to heal me and he did and and so there are times when when we start out to obey God and the results that we're after we don't see them maybe you're a pastor or a leader of a Ministry and and it seems like it's so small and so insignificant and will never be what you would like to see it I want you to know God is in even the smallest things and you need to be able to to see uh even even the uh I I I started to say the the the manger the birth uh that was the beginning of his ministry but there was much more than just the manger uh there was the whole demonstration of his Healing Ministry and then ultimately the greatest part of his ministry was that he laid down his life and he didn't stay there he came back in resurrection power what you're doing right now that looks so small and insignificant that may be the manger of your ministry this the cloud about the size of a man's hand but I want to ask the Lord to give you discernment to be able to look at that small beginning and not despise it don't despise the day of small things little is much when God is in it and I believe Elijah had a revelation of that he said we better go tell Ahab there there's an abundance of rain about to come and his servants probably thinking what what are you talking about there's just a little small Cloud floating by but he saw the bigger potential of what God was about to do and also Elijah was the prophet of fire we talked about that a broadcast or two back where he called on the fire of God a with a 63w prayer and the Lord heard that prayer and answered by fire when we think about fire we often think about judgment and this is one form that the fire of God can take to fall to bring some judgment but I want you to know that the fire of God also speaks of a baptism of purification that's coming for the last day bride oh fire of God burn in our hearts burn out the chaff sort out the dross in us so that we can be refined like the Refiner's Fire and the Fuller's Soap that the Bible talks about nobody likes the fiery trials when you're right in the middle of them but oh when they have finished their work and they take that that mixed ore that's full of uh uh of all kinds of different elements and minerals and it looks like a a hodgepodge of nothing but when it goes through the fire then it melts down and it can be separated you can take out the iron oil you can take out all the other minerals and ore and separate it from the pure gold and what you have then left is the ability to remove the most valuable of all that stuff and bring forth gold and that's what God desires to do in your life to bring forth pure gold out of the midst of your trials out of the midst of your hardship he is refining you to bring you forth as a vessel of Honor that can Shine for the for the Master's cause uh there are all kinds of vessels in the Master's use some are common vessels of of of stone and and and so forth but there are vessels unto gold and I believe I'm speaking right now to vessels unto gold God is doing a work in your life don't resist the father but surrender to him right now father I ask for Grace Grace Grace for my friends and neighbors to surrender to the fire of refinement come into their lives by the power of the Holy Spirit and bring forth your character and your attributes through their lives and Ministries I pray Lord Heal the sick I reach my hand of Faith right now in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ I agree with you for your healing that it will manifest even in this very moment in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our precious Messiah thank you for watching the eagle cry I hope you'll tune in again uh we've got a lot more to share God bless you byebye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music] h [Music]
