[53:52] those of you that live in the bottom
[53:54] will see that there's a new Runway to
[53:57] the bottom
[54:00] and I have been asked to request of you
[54:03] that you don't skid your tires or peel
[54:07] out
[54:09] because the gravels have all been packed
[54:12] down
[54:13] and when you skid them it makes the rain
[54:16] it's easier for the rain to move them
[54:18] and we don't want them moved again we
[54:20] want them to stay in place but God is
[54:23] faithful to provide for that for you and
[54:27] there was some work that has gone on on
[54:29] the grounds this week and I personally
[54:33] apologize to you that we didn't get the
[54:35] word out earlier uh I I didn't because
[54:39] the weather was so iffy but we'll give
[54:42] you another chance
[54:44] we'll give you another chance uh Joshua
[54:48] River who works with me he looked at me
[54:50] yesterday and he said I thought you said
[54:52] that the shovel doesn't fit our hand
[54:57] well that's what I'm saying when he
[54:59] works for Greeley Enterprises
[55:02] because I am not going to dig a ditch in
[55:05] somebody's yard
[55:07] but when it's for the Lord's work we do
[55:09] what we must
[55:10] to see that what he gave us is taken
[55:13] care of and so we are honored that the
[55:16] lord gave us these grounds and we want
[55:17] to take care of them in every way that
[55:19] we can and so we'll get another
[55:22] opportunity to have a work day and let
[55:24] you have a shovel in your hand if you
[55:26] wish to and get the rest of this parking
[55:29] lot ready for a coating of of asphalt
[55:32] sealer as God provides for that we we

[55:41] giving for this uh mortgage of the
[55:44] property the principal offering stands
[55:47] now at 312 475 dollars and 12 cents that
[55:52] has been given and we give God praise
[55:54] for that he is so faithful

[1:09:13] you're ever going to live in
[1:09:17] mention of the
[1:09:24] weeping and wailing
[1:09:27] grinding of teeth
[1:09:29] yes if you make it to eternal life if
[1:09:34] you make it to our Heavenly home and
[1:09:37] into our future home you will find that
[1:09:40] it is a loud place to be
[1:09:44] because it's not just four in 20 elders
[1:09:47] but it's a host of uh of innumerable
[1:09:50] angels and innumerable redeemed of all
[1:09:55] the church ages
[1:09:57] Hallelujah bowing before
[1:10:01] [Applause]
[1:10:03] lamb
[1:10:04] the lamb
[1:10:06] [Applause]
[1:10:08] oh why not get ready
[1:10:13] why not get ready over here
[1:10:17] it it means
[1:10:20] it means that we have to get out of
[1:10:23] ourselves
[1:10:26] and this is why we struggle so
[1:10:29] because we we have a mode that kicks in
[1:10:34] from the soul
[1:10:36] from the mind and the will and the
[1:10:39] emotions there is a mode that kicks in
[1:10:42] for self-preservation
[1:10:45] and we want to protect ourselves and the
[1:10:48] issue is control
[1:10:51] if you're among a people who won't
[1:10:53] praise him who can't find their place of
[1:10:56] Praise it's because they're being
[1:10:58] controlled
[1:11:02] it's a control issue and and and people
[1:11:05] are so afraid of losing control
[1:11:09] because like sister and a son it's hard
[1:11:12] to say
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:18] it's hard to say what'll happen when
[1:11:20] Jesus gets a hold of you
[1:11:23] you may stand there like a saint and
[1:11:26] just glistening tears running down your
[1:11:28] me you may kneel down like Havens Carter
[1:11:35] you heard the first podcast
[1:11:37] you may kneel down like Havens Carter my
[1:11:40] grandmother's neighbor and you may
[1:11:42] receive the Holy Ghost with your hands
[1:11:44] my granny said she looked like an angel
[1:11:47] the light was glistening on her tears
[1:11:49] and just gentle tongues was coming out
[1:11:52] of her mouth and my granny said I want
[1:11:54] it like that
[1:11:56] I want to encounter Jesus just like that
[1:11:59] oh but it didn't happen it must run in
[1:12:01] my family to be loud and exuberant
[1:12:05] she she said it didn't happen to her
[1:12:07] that way when she got it she ran and
[1:12:09] skipped and jumped and hollered and
[1:12:11] howled and and spoke in tongues and did
[1:12:15] everything but bounce off the walls that
[1:12:18] doesn't mean that either one of those
[1:12:19] experiences is more right than the other
[1:12:22] it just means it's hard to tell what'll
[1:12:24] happen
[1:12:25] when Jesus gets a hold of you
[1:12:28] so you see people who are controlled
[1:12:31] have control issues
[1:12:33] and they don't want to lose control so
[1:12:36] they're really afraid to step out into
[1:12:37] the spirit to see what might really
[1:12:40] happen if they encountered a living God
[1:12:43] but I'll tell you this if you encounter
[1:12:45] a living God I don't know whether you'll
[1:12:47] you'll howl or cry or shout or quiet
[1:12:51] reverence I don't know what you
[1:12:52] want you but I can guarantee you this
[1:12:54] you'll never be the same
[1:12:56] I want you to give him one more Roar of
[1:12:58] Praise before you sit down one more
[1:13:02] [Music]
[1:13:07] holy holy
[1:13:16] [Music]
[1:13:18] holy in my shout I want you to know why
[1:13:22] I'm shouting if I run I want you to know
[1:13:26] why I'm running
[1:13:27] [Applause]
[1:13:29] [Music]
[1:13:31] [Applause]
[1:13:34] my life has been changed
[1:13:39] praise God you may be seated just a
[1:13:43] moment
[1:13:46] he's he is here
[1:13:48] he's here let's don't let him slip from
[1:13:50] us
[1:13:51] let's hold him here
[1:13:54] let's hold his presence here until the
[1:13:56] last amen and then when we leave let's
[1:13:59] take him with us let's don't leave him
[1:14:01] here let's take him with us because
[1:14:04] we're going to need him because the day
[1:14:07] after Sunday is
[1:14:11] you're going to need him on a Monday
[1:14:14] and anymore you need him on a Tuesday
[1:14:16] and a Wednesday and a Thursday you know
[1:14:19] you you just well to get prepared you
[1:14:21] have a breakthrough service like we had
[1:14:24] here Tuesday night you better buckle up
[1:14:27] you better just buckle up and expect
[1:14:29] that the backlash of hell is going to be
[1:14:32] against you all week long
[1:14:34] we saw it from Wednesday morning until
[1:14:37] this morning
[1:14:38] same kind of pushing back from Darkness
[1:14:41] so what do we do we do do we come in
[1:14:43] here afraid we're going to disturb the
[1:14:45] enemy I better I better behave because
[1:14:47] if if I if I get a little Rowdy then the
[1:14:50] Devil he's going to come fighting me all
[1:14:52] week he is anyway
[1:14:56] so you might as well get the strength
[1:14:58] you need to do something about it and we
[1:15:01] are strengthened in the presence of the
[1:15:03] Lord I'm seeing something in the spirit
[1:15:05] right now all over this room just
[1:15:08] movement just activity and movement in
[1:15:11] the realm of the spirit and what that
[1:15:14] tells me is if you will call him to you
[1:15:17] he'll come he'll come to you
[1:15:20] just a real fluttering and movement in
[1:15:22] the spirit realm all over our heads
[1:15:25] today and if you have a need just put
[1:15:28] that need out right now put that need
[1:15:30] before him Lord here I am waiting on you

[1:15:37] deliverance touch I needs touch in my
[1:15:41] nerves I need a touch in my body

[1:16:13] appreciate it thank you for thank you
[1:16:15] David for getting here uh early and
[1:16:18] playing and you know it trickles down
[1:16:21] and appreciate it so much knowing you've
[1:16:24] got a little baby and and we're we're so
[1:16:27] excited
[1:16:28] um they're they're not here this morning
[1:16:30] they've got to watch the little baby
[1:16:32] carefully of course and we understand
[1:16:35] that but what if I told you that that
[1:16:37] the little bit the the the my family has
[1:16:41] just tormented me
[1:16:44] I'm a southerner and I speak old
[1:16:47] southern English and I say things all
[1:16:50] the time the kids say what does that
[1:16:52] even mean
[1:16:53] and they say it just like that what's it
[1:16:55] even mean
[1:16:56] it makes me mad enough to want to whoop
[1:16:58] them but
[1:17:00] uh and and I've been calling her the
[1:17:03] least one
[1:17:04] and they think that is just like more
[1:17:07] than more than non-politically correct
[1:17:11] we would say that in in in my day and it
[1:17:16] means the smallest of the two
[1:17:19] that's so much better than calling her
[1:17:21] the runt
[1:17:24] that's what I told them
[1:17:27] it doesn't mean she's any least in love
[1:17:29] or looks or or potential or destiny it
[1:17:33] just means of the two she weighs the
[1:17:35] last
[1:17:37] the least I'm going to educate some of
[1:17:39] you Yankees that worship with us
[1:17:42] I'm going to help you
[1:17:43] I was going to give you a report here
[1:17:46] if I can find it I've had dozens of
[1:17:48] texts since yesterday let me see I'm
[1:17:50] still still
[1:17:52] still scanning

[1:17:56] you the the report both both twins sweet
[1:18:00] little babies are home and as of
[1:18:03] yesterday or excuse me as of uh the the

[1:18:16] and uh Adelaide is taking off she weighs
[1:18:19] six pounds
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:22] so let's give God praise for both babies
[1:18:24] being home with Mom and Daddy
[1:18:27] on the campground
[1:18:29] [Music]
[1:18:32] and I thought it was just so appropriate
[1:18:35] that all this work that has gone on Josh
[1:18:38] has worked so hard and to make these
[1:18:41] roads so nice I rode down to the bottom
[1:18:43] of the hill didn't get muddy didn't
[1:18:46] scrape or scrub I made the circle down
[1:18:49] at the bottom and and just thanked God
[1:18:51] for the beautiful work that's been done
[1:18:53] and I thought wasn't that wonderful that
[1:18:55] that was being done as Michael and
[1:18:57] Crystal and are coming home with their
[1:18:59] with their baby that they had had to uh
[1:19:02] to leave there in the NICU for some time
[1:19:06] and it's just wonderful what God is
[1:19:08] doing and he deserves the highest praise
[1:19:12] today is brother Billy and sister
[1:19:14] Laurel's wedding anniversary they were
[1:19:17] married in 1994 how many years does that
[1:19:20] make it
[1:19:21] 29 years
[1:19:23] I want us to thank God for 29 years for
[1:19:27] them today happy anniversary
[1:19:29] [Applause]
[1:19:33] I guess you all were one of the very
[1:19:35] first weddings that we had in the church
[1:19:38] 29 years ago and Emily was the first
[1:19:41] baby born in the church and now look
[1:19:44] what has happened and look what is
[1:19:46] happening and I think before before too
[1:19:50] many decades we'll have some more
[1:19:51] weddings and
[1:19:53] some more babies and
[1:19:56] we're growing this is our idea of
[1:19:58] spiritual growth
[1:20:00] we just want every predestinated seed of
[1:20:03] God to be expressed in the Earth the
[1:20:05] faster we get them here and get them to
[1:20:07] the age of accountability the faster we
[1:20:09] can get out of here
[1:20:10] isn't that the truth
[1:20:12] I'm not making a Doctrine I'm just
[1:20:15] thanking God for new babies
[1:20:18] uh Tuesday of this week is Sister
[1:20:22] Laurel's birthday that's all we'll say
[1:20:24] about that happy birthday
[1:20:28] I'm not a dummy
[1:20:33] it's next year that we'll have something
[1:20:35] to say
[1:20:39] that's an even one then we'll leave the
[1:20:41] odd ones out but we wish you a very
[1:20:44] happy birthday happy birthday Bernie

[1:21:06] Whitmire family and his Pastor uh his
[1:21:09] brother is a pastor there in Edmonton

[1:21:19] a happy birthday on Friday night of this
[1:21:22] week at seven o'clock we're going to
[1:21:24] have a very special time of worship uh
[1:21:28] we're we're going to Worship the Lord uh
[1:21:31] for a good amount of time I don't know
[1:21:33] how long and then we're going to go into
[1:21:36] very designated prayer over some prayer
[1:21:39] points that we will give on Friday night
[1:21:41] at seven o'clock how can we invite you
[1:21:43] to be here you won't have to come and
[1:21:45] just try to figure out what to pray
[1:21:46] about we will give some very designated
[1:21:49] points of prayer and I think you'll find
[1:21:53] it a very very blessed service because
[1:21:55] the Lord has called it when he calls us
[1:21:58] to church
[1:21:59] then we know he's going to show up and
[1:22:01] it's going to be a blessing and one
[1:22:03] other announcement and that is on
[1:22:06] on uh excuse me June 3rd and 4th we're
[1:22:11] going to have our weekend meetings of
[1:22:13] Fellowship here I was speaking to
[1:22:15] brother Elam Fisher on the phone last
[1:22:17] night and he plans to be with us and
[1:22:20] some more of the Amish Brethren plan to
[1:22:22] be with us for that weekend and uh I
[1:22:25] don't know if you all remember brother
[1:22:27] Levi who was here or not his wife was
[1:22:31] the sister who was in the wheelchair how
[1:22:33] many of you remember when they were with
[1:22:34] us he's coming and bringing some folks
[1:22:37] with him uh they're in another different
[1:22:40] place a slightly different place in
[1:22:42] Indiana and while he was here he told me
[1:22:45] that they were going to be building a
[1:22:46] church and they wanted me to come and
[1:22:48] dedicate it when it was ready and we
[1:22:50] found out that last weekend the the
[1:22:53] Brethren who come and fellowship with us
[1:22:55] often they went over and helped start
[1:22:57] raising up the church and there's
[1:23:00] another church in Ohio of wonderful
[1:23:02] former Amish people who have all been
[1:23:05] baptized recently and quite a number of
[1:23:08] them and have accepted the message of
[1:23:10] the hour and was talking to brother Elam
[1:23:12] about it last night and he said we've
[1:23:14] waited on this for years and years this
[1:23:18] is the promised breakthrough and God is
[1:23:21] doing things among the Amish bringing
[1:23:24] them out of a system and into a truth
[1:23:27] that will absolutely transform them I
[1:23:30] believe that with all my heart there's a
[1:23:33] transforming power in this message of
[1:23:35] Truth so we're excited about what God is
[1:23:38] doing there and we want you to continue
[1:23:40] to pray for them let's thank God for the
[1:23:43] musicians and the worship leaders and
[1:23:45] let them go down
[1:23:46] [Applause]

[1:27:10] brothers and sisters in Indiana
[1:27:12] the Netherlands twice
[1:27:15] another Indiana Ontario Canada and it
[1:27:18] goes on we just want to take a minute to
[1:27:21] let them know we appreciate them being a
[1:27:23] part of our service God bless every one
[1:27:25] of you wherever you are watching from
[1:27:28] and we only know if people type it in so
[1:27:31] if you want us to know where you're from
[1:27:33] type it in first Thessalonians chapter
[1:27:35] 4.
[1:27:38] of verse 15 16 and 17 Again
[1:27:43] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:27:48] the Lord
[1:27:49] that we which are alive and remain unto
[1:27:54] the coming of the Lord shall not prevent
[1:27:57] them which are asleep for the Lord
[1:28:02] himself
[1:28:03] shall descend from heaven with a
[1:28:07] Shout with the voice of the
[1:28:11] Archangel and with the
[1:28:14] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[1:28:18] shall rise first let's do that verse
[1:28:20] again for the Lord himself shall descend
[1:28:23] from heaven with a shout with the voice
[1:28:26] of the Archangel and with the Trump of
[1:28:29] God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:28:33] first then we which are alive and remain
[1:28:37] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:28:41] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[1:28:44] and so shall we
[1:28:48] ever be with the Lord how many of you
[1:28:51] believe the reality of that
[1:28:54] how many of you believe it's in progress
[1:28:55] now
[1:28:57] we're not just looking putting this off
[1:28:59] in the future we're actually believing
[1:29:02] that it has started
[1:29:05] a whole generation ago the Lord's coming
[1:29:08] has already started and we're waiting on
[1:29:12] the culmination of that coming is that
[1:29:14] right then let's go to Revelation 10
[1:29:17] while you're still standing and get a
[1:29:20] little bit of a review because we took
[1:29:22] off for Mother's Day weekend and we and
[1:29:26] we spoke about the women of God in our
[1:29:28] midst and so I want to make sure that
[1:29:31] you remember where we are in this series
[1:29:35] we could read the whole chapter of
[1:29:38] Revelation 10 but I'm going to skip down
[1:29:41] just a little I'm going to start in
[1:29:42] verse 1 and we'll see where we go and I
[1:29:45] saw another Mighty Angel come down from
[1:29:49] heaven clothed with a cloud uh and a
[1:29:53] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:29:56] was as it were the son and his feet as
[1:30:00] pillars of fire and he had in his hand a
[1:30:04] little book I want you you to describe
[1:30:06] the book I want you to give me that next
[1:30:08] word and he had in his hand a little
[1:30:10] book
[1:30:11] open
[1:30:13] because Revelation 5 tells us that from
[1:30:16] the midst of the throne there came a
[1:30:18] lamb and the lamb opened the seals is
[1:30:23] that right he took the book out of the
[1:30:25] hand of him that sat upon the throne and
[1:30:28] he opened the book
[1:30:30] amen that wasn't brother Branham
[1:30:34] that wasn't any other Prophet that lamb
[1:30:37] was Jesus
[1:30:38] and this Mighty angel of Revelation 10 1
[1:30:41] that's not brother Branham that's not
[1:30:44] any other wonderful servant of the Lord
[1:30:46] that's him that's Jesus Christ John saw
[1:30:50] him as an angel with a rainbow about his
[1:30:54] head which makes him the angel of the
[1:30:57] Covenant and we know that to be the
[1:30:59] angel of the Lord and brother Branham
[1:31:02] talked about the angel of the Lord and
[1:31:05] that is none other than the Lord Jesus
[1:31:07] Christ the book that was once closed it
[1:31:11] was once sealed has now been opened and
[1:31:14] it is in the hand of the Lord Jesus he
[1:31:17] himself brings the message of the open
[1:31:20] book he comes down with the open book in
[1:31:24] his hand and cried with a loud voice as
[1:31:27] when a lion roareth and when he had
[1:31:30] cried what happens
[1:31:32] seven Thunders uttered their voices
[1:31:35] verse 4 and when the seven Thunders had
[1:31:37] uttered their voices I was about to
[1:31:39] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[1:31:42] saying unto me seal up those things I I
[1:31:45] like this because it right in the middle
[1:31:48] of the apocalypsis
[1:31:50] right in the middle of the unveiling of
[1:31:54] Jesus Christ the revealing of all the
[1:31:57] mystery we have this instruction that
[1:32:00] seems so contrary to what's going on
[1:32:02] this is a season of opening things up
[1:32:05] the whole book of the Revelation is a
[1:32:08] season of opening things up and making
[1:32:11] them known and in the middle of a season
[1:32:14] of making things known by Revelation a
[1:32:18] voice says Ah
[1:32:23] don't let that go anywhere
[1:32:26] don't write that down brother Branham
[1:32:30] tells us about those sunders they're not
[1:32:33] even written in the book
[1:32:35] where did he get that idea right there
[1:32:38] they're not even written down right them
[1:32:41] not
[1:32:42] and and he goes on
[1:32:45] I guess I should just read it since
[1:32:47] you're already standing and the angel
[1:32:50] which I saw stand upon the sea and upon
[1:32:53] the Earth lifted up His Hands to Heaven
[1:32:56] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[1:33:00] ever who created heaven and the things
[1:33:02] that therein are and the earth and the
[1:33:05] things that therein are and the Sea and
[1:33:07] the things which are therein that there
[1:33:10] should be
[1:33:12] time no longer and as I always mention
[1:33:16] one translation says that there should
[1:33:18] be no more delay
[1:33:21] if you've got a pen why don't you write
[1:33:24] that write in your Bible or on your
[1:33:26] notes if you're if you don't write right
[1:33:29] in I pass your pen to somebody I think
[1:33:33] it would be so important for you to know
[1:33:36] that it is not the ending of time as we
[1:33:40] would interpret it's the ending of delay
[1:33:44] what it what it's saying to us is things
[1:33:47] are now kicking in
[1:33:50] they're not coming to an abrupt end
[1:33:54] as we hear preached all around us
[1:33:57] but delay that has held all of these
[1:34:01] things back is what's coming to an end
[1:34:03] and now the program of God will spin
[1:34:07] full force
[1:34:08] until all these things are fulfilled
[1:34:11] all these things must be revealed and
[1:34:14] they must be fulfilled
[1:34:16] and so time time no longer is telling us
[1:34:19] no more delay I I wish somebody I know
[1:34:24] you're standing if you need to sit
[1:34:25] please do I wish somebody would prophesy
[1:34:28] with me right now did you know you are
[1:34:31] you are a Sin from God
[1:34:33] and did you know when you speak the word
[1:34:35] as a word send from God what you declare
[1:34:39] it's not just a declaration it becomes a
[1:34:42] prophecy
[1:34:46] if you and I should prophesy together
[1:34:49] today no more delay
[1:34:53] how about let's doing it together one
[1:34:56] two three no more delay we're calling an
[1:35:01] end
[1:35:02] to that which has held us
[1:35:05] that which has delayed us
[1:35:07] that which has retired that's not the
[1:35:10] word I want to use
[1:35:14] handicapped us
[1:35:16] it has held us back we are ready to see
[1:35:19] that moved out of the way we're ready to
[1:35:22] see time moving in our favor
[1:35:26] instead of out of our favor
[1:35:28] all right I'm getting excited here and
[1:35:31] you're see what happens when you still
[1:35:33] stand
[1:35:34] it gets me excited
[1:35:37] but you've got to be seated why don't
[1:35:39] you just go ahead God bless you may God
[1:35:41] add his Blessing to the reading of the
[1:35:42] word be seated
[1:35:45] time should be no more that there will
[1:35:48] be delay no longer that there will be
[1:35:51] delay no longer no more delay but in the
[1:35:56] day
[1:35:57] of The Voice
[1:36:00] God is jealous
[1:36:03] over that voice
[1:36:06] it's his voice
[1:36:07] it's his voice it's his voice that spoke
[1:36:11] through Paul
[1:36:13] it's his voice that spoke through all of
[1:36:16] the other seven Church age Messengers
[1:36:19] all seven of them it was not their voice
[1:36:23] but it was the voice of God using their
[1:36:27] voice you believe that don't you
[1:36:30] not everything they said
[1:36:33] but when they were speaking under
[1:36:36] inspiration as brother random explains
[1:36:38] to us then that wasn't them talking
[1:36:40] anymore I love those moments that
[1:36:43] brother Branham got so caught up in the
[1:36:45] inspiration of what was happening that
[1:36:48] he'd say that wasn't me
[1:36:50] he recognized that something had taken
[1:36:54] over and was speaking through him come
[1:36:58] on now I want you to know the bride has
[1:37:00] a voice
[1:37:04] remember remember that Christ is the
[1:37:07] mystery of God revealed
[1:37:09] and the bride is the mystery of Christ
[1:37:13] revealed
[1:37:14] amen he comes he comes in the fullness
[1:37:18] of his word
[1:37:20] he comes in Bride form
[1:37:22] then he comes in bridegroom form
[1:37:25] it's the same Christ it's the same word
[1:37:28] anybody with me
[1:37:31] it's the same Christ it's the same word
[1:37:33] he comes first in the revealing of his
[1:37:36] word we call that word form you want to
[1:37:39] write it down go ahead he comes the next
[1:37:42] time in his bride
[1:37:44] that is what we call the bride form
[1:37:46] coming of the Lord and the next time is
[1:37:49] him coming himself in bridegroom form in
[1:37:53] the air to receive us as we just read in
[1:37:56] first Thessalonians
[1:37:58] not a mystical thing after all it's been
[1:38:00] revealed to us by the Holy Spirit how
[1:38:03] many of you are thankful for the message
[1:38:04] of the hour I'm so thankful for it
[1:38:07] because we as I have mentioned to you
[1:38:09] before we were taught that it all
[1:38:12] happens in a batting of an eye
[1:38:14] I grew up in Pentecost and in Holiness
[1:38:18] and their idea of the coming Rapture was
[1:38:22] that it would all happen in the batting
[1:38:24] of an eye in the blinking of an eye look
[1:38:27] it's all over with
[1:38:28] not understanding but only the
[1:38:31] culmination of the coming
[1:38:35] the consummation of the coming is in a
[1:38:38] moment in a twinkling of an eye the rest
[1:38:40] of it is a process of coming
[1:38:43] he he's still coming
[1:38:45] he's still coming because he comes in
[1:38:48] word form he comes in Bride form and
[1:38:51] then he comes himself in bridegroom form
[1:38:53] isn't that powerful what do we connect
[1:38:56] that to we connect that to where brother
[1:38:58] Branham said that he comes the first
[1:39:00] time to do what
[1:39:02] help me Jesus comes the first time to do
[1:39:06] what
[1:39:07] to redeem
[1:39:10] he comes the first time to redeem his
[1:39:13] bride
[1:39:14] he comes the next time to do what
[1:39:17] to receive his bride you better write
[1:39:19] this down
[1:39:21] he comes the first time
[1:39:24] to redeem his bride he comes the second
[1:39:27] time to receive his bride he comes the
[1:39:31] third time
[1:39:32] with his bride now you can find that all
[1:39:35] through the message of the hour in fact
[1:39:37] we have quotes coming up on that
[1:39:39] somewhere in this series
[1:39:42] but not for today
[1:39:44] so this is great that God has preserved
[1:39:49] The Voice
[1:39:50] because when some people read that they
[1:39:52] say well that ended in 1965 because the
[1:39:56] mouthpiece was taken from off the scene
[1:39:58] but notice it didn't say the voice of
[1:40:00] the prophet
[1:40:02] it doesn't say the vessel that God is
[1:40:04] going to use for this Angel to speak
[1:40:06] through
[1:40:07] it just says but in the days of The
[1:40:10] Voice
[1:40:10] and how many of you know that we're
[1:40:12] living in an hour where the voice is
[1:40:14] recorded
[1:40:17] and we can hear the voice
[1:40:19] so I'd like for you to know that we are
[1:40:22] still in the days of the voice anybody
[1:40:25] with me we're still in the days of the
[1:40:28] voice I like it when brother Branham
[1:40:30] kind of talks about that he he tells us
[1:40:34] that if such an instrument could be
[1:40:38] invented that you would be able to tap
[1:40:42] into the atmosphere because he said the
[1:40:46] sound waves are still moving around the
[1:40:49] Earth
[1:40:50] yes he said around
[1:40:52] and uh those sound waves are still
[1:40:55] moving around and he said if we could if
[1:40:57] we could find the right instrument to
[1:41:00] tap into that he said we could hear
[1:41:02] today the preaching of Noah
[1:41:10] so the voice of Noah is still out there
[1:41:13] somewhere
[1:41:14] is that right
[1:41:16] and that's why that little bride is
[1:41:19] coming forth in the with the sound the
[1:41:21] voice of the sound of many Waters
[1:41:23] because it's not just one voice it's a
[1:41:27] five-fold Ministry voice and it's it's
[1:41:30] echoing and all of those voices are
[1:41:32] coming together in fact as we looked at
[1:41:35] and we'll look at again they formed the
[1:41:37] voice of the archangel
[1:41:39] brother Branham didn't tell us that the
[1:41:41] voice of the Archangel is the voice of
[1:41:43] an archangel like Michael or Gabriel he
[1:41:46] speaks about that voice as being a
[1:41:49] mini-membered bride as being a voice
[1:41:51] with many facets to it like the voice of
[1:41:54] many Waters it's like a Babbling Brook
[1:41:56] how many of you love the sound of the
[1:41:58] Rushing Water and the fivefold ministry
[1:42:00] is a part of the Bride coming of Christ
[1:42:03] the fivefold ministry has a
[1:42:06] responsibility to do in the bride coming
[1:42:08] of Christ and that's the hour that we're
[1:42:11] living in right now and that voice
[1:42:13] begins to culminate that's what the word
[1:42:15] said that voice begins to culminate and
[1:42:18] prepare a people
[1:42:20] now we're not living in the in the days
[1:42:22] of the live Ministry of brother Adam but
[1:42:25] we're still living in the days of The
[1:42:27] Voice
[1:42:27] because his voice is still sounding we
[1:42:30] can still go and feast and I do on a
[1:42:32] weekly basis we Feast on the word that
[1:42:35] has been preserved for this day and I
[1:42:37] encourage you to do that
[1:42:40] and don't spend all your time in the
[1:42:42] church age book go back and hear the
[1:42:45] voice
[1:42:46] because there's something in that voice
[1:42:48] that transforms
[1:42:51] wait a minute amen Pastor thank you for
[1:42:55] that good advice
[1:42:57] you're welcome
[1:43:00] I want you to hear what I'm saying but
[1:43:03] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:43:05] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[1:43:07] mystery of God should be finished
[1:43:11] now this has been interpreted by our
[1:43:13] Brethren is finished
[1:43:19] but that's not what it says
[1:43:21] it says it should be
[1:43:25] this gives indication that there may be
[1:43:29] some things that try to stand in the way
[1:43:33] that doesn't mean that God won't have
[1:43:35] his way
[1:43:36] let me tell you something God's going to
[1:43:38] have his way I want you to look at your
[1:43:40] neighbor don't be embarrassed
[1:43:42] your breath doesn't smell too bad
[1:43:44] look at your neighbor
[1:43:47] and and say to them God always makes a
[1:43:50] way
[1:43:51] he's going to make a way
[1:43:54] if something should be finished that is
[1:43:57] not yet totally finished God's going to
[1:44:00] make a way
[1:44:02] he's going to make a way you need to
[1:44:05] hear this for the rest of the study he's
[1:44:07] going to make a way it says it should be
[1:44:10] finished
[1:44:10] and I don't want to cause any more
[1:44:13] controversy than I already do every time
[1:44:15] I open my mouth
[1:44:17] but I want to call your attention to the
[1:44:21] singularity of the word mystery
[1:44:26] now brother Branham rarely said mystery
[1:44:31] he most often said Mysteries
[1:44:36] because he was quoting it from memory
[1:44:40] no big deal here but then he takes that
[1:44:44] servants the prophets
[1:44:46] and he depluralizes
[1:44:49] both servants and prophet
[1:44:52] and he often says in the days of the
[1:44:55] voice the mysteries of God should be
[1:44:58] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:45:01] servant the prophet
[1:45:04] now I am a person who believes that that
[1:45:07] can make a world of difference when we
[1:45:11] go to apply the word
[1:45:14] anybody with me you see it's not just in
[1:45:17] hearing it and understanding it now I've
[1:45:19] got to take what I hear and I got to
[1:45:21] figure out how to apply it to the hour
[1:45:23] I'm living in
[1:45:25] amen and since we don't see the finality
[1:45:29] of all things we have to say there's
[1:45:32] something yet in that mystery of God
[1:45:36] that has not yet been completely made
[1:45:38] known
[1:45:39] now I believe a portion of that is what
[1:45:42] I have just quoted to you a moment ago
[1:45:44] that that the mystery of God is revealed
[1:45:48] in Christ
[1:45:49] Christ is the mystery of God
[1:45:52] and I believe that a portion of the rest
[1:45:56] of that that the mystery of Christ is
[1:46:01] revealed in the bride or the bride is
[1:46:03] the revealing of the mystery of Christ I
[1:46:06] think that's a key
[1:46:07] to see this mystery finished
[1:46:12] let me see if you heard what I'm saying
[1:46:15] I think that this is a part it's you
[1:46:18] being able to identify your position in
[1:46:23] this equation
[1:46:24] you see there's no doubt in my mind that
[1:46:27] brother Branham helped us to see clearly
[1:46:30] that Jehovah of the Old Testament
[1:46:33] is Jesus of the new
[1:46:35] but now I want to ask you who are you
[1:46:41] who are you
[1:46:43] brother Branham asked us at the end of
[1:46:46] his ministry several times from
[1:46:49] scripture
[1:46:50] what house
[1:46:52] will you build me
[1:46:54] right what are the last messages what
[1:46:57] house will you build me so now Christ is
[1:47:01] looking for a place to live
[1:47:04] now the church at large teaches that
[1:47:06] Christ comes to live in US
[1:47:08] that that's not a great great Revelation
[1:47:11] there but what is great and what is
[1:47:14] powerful and what is missing in this
[1:47:16] hour is he doesn't just come to live in
[1:47:19] us to make us feel warm and fuzzy
[1:47:22] he comes to live in us because he wants
[1:47:25] to burst out of us
[1:47:27] doing the same things that he did while
[1:47:30] he was on planet Earth
[1:47:31] and so he wants to he wants to raise the
[1:47:35] Dead
[1:47:36] he wants to heal the sick
[1:47:40] he wants to manifest Deliverance
[1:47:43] through his bride
[1:47:46] and that is a fully adopted bride that's
[1:47:49] coming to maturity
[1:47:52] right and when she stands in the
[1:47:55] fullness of her maturity what will you
[1:47:57] have you will have a mystery of God
[1:48:00] completely finished
[1:48:04] a process
[1:48:06] from the logos
[1:48:09] remember how he talks about that
[1:48:12] Fountain of Light
[1:48:14] that bubbling Fountain of color
[1:48:17] and he said are you with me
[1:48:19] and he said out of that Fountain of
[1:48:23] Light Came to logos
[1:48:25] so that's the beginning of the mystery
[1:48:27] right there
[1:48:28] you see there was a time when God was
[1:48:30] not God
[1:48:33] somebody said God is eternal he's
[1:48:36] Eternal in spirit
[1:48:38] but not Eternal in office
[1:48:40] because in order for him to be God in
[1:48:42] office there has to be something created
[1:48:45] or something that can recognize who he
[1:48:48] is and worship him
[1:48:50] so in the very beginning it was just
[1:48:53] spirit and light God
[1:48:55] eternal
[1:48:56] you you can say father
[1:48:58] you can say the eternal spirit of the
[1:49:01] father but in order to manifest that he
[1:49:03] was the eternal spirit of the father he
[1:49:05] had to birth something
[1:49:07] he had to create something do you
[1:49:09] understand where I'm going so the
[1:49:11] mystery of God started before the
[1:49:15] foundation of the world and the Mystery
[1:49:18] of God will be finished at the end of
[1:49:22] the laodicean church age
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:26] it took all of the old Covenant
[1:49:29] it took
[1:49:31] on Church ages for this mystery of God
[1:49:35] to be finished
[1:49:37] Paul was a part of it
[1:49:39] Arrhenius and Martin Luther and Wesley
[1:49:42] these men were all apart in finishing
[1:49:46] the mystery of God
[1:49:48] and one of these days it's going to be
[1:49:50] finished in you and it's not going to be
[1:49:53] you anymore but it's going to be he who
[1:49:55] is who has possessed you
[1:49:59] see the whole concept of demon
[1:50:01] possession is an enter type for
[1:50:03] something that's great and real and that
[1:50:06] is a people that are fully possessed by
[1:50:07] God
[1:50:09] you see that Old Demon is what he always
[1:50:11] is an imitator
[1:50:13] an impersonator and he tries to control
[1:50:16] people with evil
[1:50:18] but there's going to be a fully adopted
[1:50:20] manifested bride
[1:50:22] she will come forth in the last of the
[1:50:25] last days she will have the saith the
[1:50:29] Lord and without the saith the Lord
[1:50:31] Brother random said she will keep her
[1:50:34] peace
[1:50:35] she won't speak without no saith the
[1:50:37] Lord because she's going to be so fully
[1:50:40] surrendered to him
[1:50:41] why how do we get to that place how will
[1:50:44] we ever get to that place we're we're
[1:50:46] processing it now
[1:50:51] I'm getting ahead of myself
[1:50:53] we're processing it now because remember
[1:50:55] when we did the series
[1:50:57] some years ago
[1:50:59] we got all the way down to this amazing
[1:51:01] verse
[1:51:02] and I want you to go there with me for
[1:51:04] just a moment I want you to go all the
[1:51:07] way down to verse 9.
[1:51:08] well wait a minute we better read verse
[1:51:10] eight and the voice which I heard from
[1:51:14] heaven
[1:51:14] spake unto me again and said why don't
[1:51:17] you all read it for me would you let me
[1:51:18] get my breath go and
[1:51:21] [Music]
[1:51:23] thank you
[1:51:28] now now who is to come and take the book
[1:51:33] who is to go and take the little book
[1:51:35] out of the hand of Jesus Christ
[1:51:37] who is the person who's supposed to do
[1:51:39] that
[1:51:40] who is that being spoken to
[1:51:42] John
[1:51:44] the prophet tells us that John is a type
[1:51:47] of what
[1:51:48] the bride
[1:51:51] so did you know that means that in John
[1:51:54] in Revelation chapter 4 when the when
[1:51:57] the spirit of the Lord says to John come
[1:51:59] up higher
[1:52:04] let me read that I'm getting a little
[1:52:06] bit of help I'm I can preach in a minute
[1:52:07] I'm getting a little help here
[1:52:09] after this I looked and behold the door
[1:52:12] was opened in heaven
[1:52:14] and the first voice which I heard was as
[1:52:17] it were of a trumpet talking with me
[1:52:19] which said come up
[1:52:22] come up
[1:52:24] hither higher and I will show thee
[1:52:29] things which must be here after
[1:52:33] that was John
[1:52:35] if John is a type of the Bride you and I
[1:52:38] will not see
[1:52:41] the finishing of the mystery
[1:52:44] until we recognize that the bride is
[1:52:48] receiving the same upward call
[1:52:51] it's called the ascended life
[1:52:56] you want to make people jealous
[1:52:58] I don't really want to make them jealous
[1:53:00] but you want to see people turn jealous
[1:53:03] you just start living a higher life
[1:53:06] that could mean a lot of things but you
[1:53:08] know what I'm saying this morning you
[1:53:10] just start getting up above the the pig
[1:53:12] pen that you've been living in
[1:53:14] and the first thing somebody will say oh
[1:53:16] he's all religious all of a sudden
[1:53:19] but the world doesn't even know what
[1:53:20] religion is
[1:53:21] they don't even understand what religion
[1:53:24] is if they did they'd know that I hate
[1:53:26] it as much as anybody
[1:53:28] religion is vile it's reality and
[1:53:31] relationship
[1:53:33] it's Revelation that we're after not
[1:53:35] religion come on now so anybody that
[1:53:38] tries to to yield to the trumpet call
[1:53:41] and get up a little bit higher than
[1:53:43] those living around them they're going
[1:53:45] to get the Joseph experience
[1:53:48] they're going to be sold into slavery by
[1:53:51] their brethren
[1:53:52] they're going to be left for the wild
[1:53:54] animals to devour but don't you worry
[1:53:57] because remember what we said a few
[1:53:59] moments ago God Will Make A Way
[1:54:03] from the pit to the Palace
[1:54:05] from the slave block to the prime
[1:54:09] minister
[1:54:10] to a little forgotten forsaken ignored
[1:54:13] bride to a people with thus saith the
[1:54:16] Lord in their mouth
[1:54:19] speaking to the storm talking to the
[1:54:22] cancer
[1:54:23] [Applause]
[1:54:25] not begging God to move it
[1:54:28] not crying
[1:54:31] remember the bride's Destiny is not to
[1:54:34] cry forever we cry now
[1:54:37] [Music]
[1:54:40] I wished I was sitting Where You Are
[1:54:44] because I'd be getting happy
[1:54:47] let me have a little water
[1:54:53] God's got something for us
[1:54:56] we've got something to shout about now
[1:54:59] but you ain't seen nothing yet
[1:55:01] if you folks don't hurry up and get
[1:55:03] caught up with this Shout
[1:55:05] I don't know what in the world you're
[1:55:06] going to do when the real shout moves
[1:55:08] among us when the real shout of the king
[1:55:10] is heard in the camp walls come down
[1:55:13] come on now principalities bow
[1:55:17] you don't have to go looking for a demon
[1:55:19] to talk to when you have thus saith the
[1:55:21] Lord
[1:55:23] you don't have to go finding a devil
[1:55:25] under a rock when you have the say of
[1:55:27] the Lord you just move forth in his
[1:55:31] authority
[1:55:33] the devil has to get out of your way
[1:55:36] oh yes
[1:55:38] oh yes
[1:55:40] I know him and the devil said I know him
[1:55:44] and he don't speak like he used to speak
[1:55:46] and he don't move like he used to move
[1:55:49] something has happened in him I'm just
[1:55:51] going to give him the right away here
[1:55:53] I'm going to yield and let him get right
[1:55:55] remember that the whole purpose of the
[1:55:57] enemy according to the prophet the whole
[1:55:59] purpose of Satan
[1:56:02] is to be a tool
[1:56:08] just a tool
[1:56:10] remember the Bible said that God created
[1:56:12] evil
[1:56:17] a hard time
[1:56:23] but he's straight from the word
[1:56:25] he created it why would a loving God
[1:56:28] create something like evil because it
[1:56:32] serves his purpose
[1:56:35] in getting God to man
[1:56:40] his purpose his intention in the
[1:56:42] beginning
[1:56:43] was that God become man
[1:56:49] that God come down and live in a body of
[1:56:53] Flesh
[1:56:54] so that the redeemed of Adam's Fallen
[1:56:57] race the sons of man could come up
[1:57:01] and yield and build yield and build a
[1:57:05] house
[1:57:10] so the preaching of a barely getting by
[1:57:12] experience
[1:57:13] it's not going to perfect a bride and
[1:57:16] sharpen her in this hour
[1:57:17] the preaching of just you're just always
[1:57:20] easy what you are you're never going to
[1:57:22] be able to get above that you'll always
[1:57:24] struggle with the same thing you've been
[1:57:26] struggling with now you'll just have to
[1:57:28] come to accept that as the reality
[1:57:30] that's not the reality of the Bible
[1:57:32] that's not the reality of a Jesus
[1:57:34] encounter
[1:57:36] Bartimaeus didn't stay the same help me
[1:57:40] amen the widow woman son of name he
[1:57:43] didn't stay the same
[1:57:44] [Music]
[1:57:44] [Applause]
[1:57:45] let's go through the New Testament and
[1:57:47] realize that anybody who has an
[1:57:49] encounter with Jesus they are changed
[1:57:53] and we are not preaching about just
[1:57:55] encountering Jesus we're preaching about
[1:57:58] building him a house
[1:58:00] [Music]
[1:58:02] that he can come and live in
[1:58:04] now so this is the Angel speaking to
[1:58:07] John and he says and I went unto the
[1:58:10] angel and said unto him give me the
[1:58:12] little book
[1:58:14] and he said unto me
[1:58:17] take it
[1:58:19] and eat it up
[1:58:21] and it shall make thy belly bitter
[1:58:26] but it shall be in thy mouth
[1:58:33] sweet as honey
[1:58:35] anybody still with me
[1:58:39] sweet as honey
[1:58:41] now you see this is a process
[1:58:44] this is a process I can't get to that
[1:58:47] just yet I'd like to
[1:58:49] but I can't get to that just yet let me
[1:58:52] share something with you in in the first
[1:58:54] phase of the coming of the Lord he's
[1:58:56] coming with a shout is that right and
[1:58:59] that's the word coming
[1:59:00] it's true isn't it that's the revealing
[1:59:03] of the word
[1:59:04] that's the finishing of the mystery of
[1:59:06] God that's the third seal where bro the
[1:59:10] prophet said the bride has never had a
[1:59:14] Revival yet
[1:59:15] isn't that what he said third seal
[1:59:19] halfway through the bride has never had
[1:59:22] a Revival yet because it's going to take
[1:59:24] the mystery the revelation of those
[1:59:27] seven
[1:59:29] unknown Thunders that's what he calls
[1:59:31] them there isn't it so at least at that
[1:59:33] time he himself at that moment didn't
[1:59:36] know what they were
[1:59:38] are we right to say that
[1:59:41] this is all a part of the Bride coming
[1:59:43] of Christ and I want you to see what
[1:59:45] that looks like in the message it is the
[1:59:47] rising of the Sun
[1:59:49] paragraph 94 you're ready to study this
[1:59:52] in the time we have left we got to move
[1:59:55] but I want you to see this God bless you
[1:59:57] that are joining us in the Cape of South
[1:59:59] Africa so many other places thank you
[2:00:02] for being with us
[2:00:05] paragraph 94 ask Christ was the first
[2:00:09] one to raise from all the prophets and
[2:00:13] so forth although typed in many places
[2:00:17] he was
[2:00:19] how about you read it he was
[2:00:23] that slept
[2:00:27] he was the first resurrection
[2:00:29] he was the first fruits in the
[2:00:31] resurrection now if we were to count
[2:00:34] from the Feast of firstfruits which
[2:00:37] happens around our Easter time or the
[2:00:41] end of our Passover feast of unleavened
[2:00:43] bread if we were to count 50 days and we
[2:00:48] must
[2:00:50] because 50 days after the resurrection
[2:00:53] of Christ brings us to shavot
[2:00:57] and shovel is Pentecost
[2:01:00] and when we come together next Friday
[2:01:03] night we will be praying during the
[2:01:06] Feast of Shabbat we will be praying
[2:01:08] during the biblical season of what we
[2:01:10] have come to call Pentecost penty being
[2:01:13] 50 in the Greek
[2:01:15] and the reason why that's so significant
[2:01:18] is because we are we just passed the
[2:01:21] 40th Day
[2:01:22] and the 40th Day what happened what
[2:01:25] happened the 40th Day after the
[2:01:26] Resurrection on the Feast of first
[2:01:28] fruits what happened on the 40th Day
[2:01:31] he ascended
[2:01:33] from the Mount of Olives into heaven on
[2:01:37] the 40th Day so we've just about passed
[2:01:40] that it was just a few days ago that we
[2:01:42] would have hit the 40th Day and now it's
[2:01:44] 10-day count
[2:01:47] to chevote it's 10-day count to
[2:01:50] Pentecost this helps us to place
[2:01:52] ourselves in the word don't you like to
[2:01:55] find your place in the book
[2:01:57] oh I'd like to find my place in the book
[2:02:00] and so he was raised as the firstborn of
[2:02:04] many Brethren the first fruits of those
[2:02:07] that slept and then 40 days later he
[2:02:11] ascended into heaven
[2:02:14] and he told them uh when he left
[2:02:18] to watch and pray
[2:02:22] some glorious things are going to happen
[2:02:25] he basically said I'll meet you in a few
[2:02:27] days
[2:02:29] in the upper room
[2:02:30] I'm paraphrasing Arna but that's
[2:02:34] basically what he said
[2:02:35] you going to meet together and I'm going
[2:02:39] to show up in your midst and I'm going
[2:02:42] to endure you
[2:02:45] I'm going to imbibe you with power
[2:02:49] from on high
[2:02:51] you are going to get your first charge
[2:02:55] your first electrical charge of my glory
[2:03:00] and when you get the initial charge
[2:03:02] you're never going to be satisfied until
[2:03:04] you have more you're going to want to
[2:03:06] move from glory to glory you're going to
[2:03:09] want to move from Faith to Faith you're
[2:03:11] going to want to move from strength to
[2:03:12] strength because I have got up as the
[2:03:16] first fruits of them that sleep now
[2:03:18] watch what brother Branham goes on to
[2:03:19] say in the bride coming of Christ
[2:03:22] coming out of the church
[2:03:25] they'll be there'll have to be a Sheaf
[2:03:31] waved again in the last days
[2:03:35] now someone challenged me one time I
[2:03:38] know you can't imagine
[2:03:39] someone challenged me one time over a
[2:03:42] comma
[2:03:45] and I want you to know that
[2:03:48] it's not encouraged
[2:03:50] to interpret scripture
[2:03:53] by punctuation
[2:03:56] kind of a dangerous thing to do
[2:03:58] so when we don't know as in Revelation
[2:04:01] 10 where
[2:04:03] he pluralized the single and
[2:04:06] singularized the plural
[2:04:08] you go back to the original and you try
[2:04:11] to determine the word that was used in
[2:04:13] the beginning and it's not always enough
[2:04:17] and I have heard for our sermons
[2:04:21] preached from the message on the placing
[2:04:25] of a comma
[2:04:29] you can't always trust
[2:04:32] the placing of a comma in the King James
[2:04:35] version of the Bible
[2:04:37] you may not always be able to build a
[2:04:40] Doctrine on the placing of a comma in
[2:04:42] the message of the hour
[2:04:44] because there's something you need to
[2:04:46] know about brother Branham
[2:04:48] I don't know anybody else like this
[2:04:51] his sentences
[2:04:55] I think we call them run-on sentences
[2:04:59] because they run on and on and on and on
[2:05:01] and on and on and on
[2:05:03] how would you like to be the comma
[2:05:05] putter
[2:05:07] how would you like to be the one that
[2:05:10] had to decide where the comma goes you
[2:05:12] know there is an
[2:05:14] incentives an interesting example of
[2:05:16] this in the scripture if you're still
[2:05:18] with me
[2:05:19] uh the Bible said when the enemy cometh
[2:05:23] in like a flood
[2:05:26] he the spirit will raise up a standard
[2:05:30] against him can someone give me the
[2:05:31] address of that
[2:05:34] Isaiah what
[2:05:37] Isaiah 59
[2:05:40] and what verse do we know
[2:05:43] all right let's look and see
[2:05:46] anybody still here
[2:05:48] praise God
[2:05:50] Isaiah 53 19 59 59 19 good sister
[2:05:56] Beverly that was from singing days
[2:05:59] they sung her and brother skip or sung
[2:06:02] the Bible
[2:06:03] 59 so shall they fear the name of the
[2:06:08] Lord from the West and his glory from
[2:06:11] the rising of the sun period now watch
[2:06:13] this this is how this is how the King
[2:06:15] James translators uh grammarized and
[2:06:18] punctuated this verse when the enemy
[2:06:21] shall come in like a flood comma the
[2:06:24] spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[2:06:27] standard against him how many of you
[2:06:28] think that's amazing I love it
[2:06:31] has anybody ever seen the enemy come in
[2:06:33] like a flood let me see your hand
[2:06:36] play along class
[2:06:39] help your aging teacher would you
[2:06:42] help me know you're still there how many
[2:06:45] have never seen the enemy come in like a
[2:06:47] flood
[2:06:48] in your neighbor's life
[2:06:51] have you ever seen him come in like a
[2:06:52] flood in your life so none of us have a
[2:06:55] problem believing that the enemy can
[2:06:57] come in like a flood right
[2:06:59] this verse goes on to say the spirit
[2:07:02] when the enemy does come in like a flood
[2:07:04] the spirit of the Lord shall lift up her
[2:07:07] standard against him does that comfort
[2:07:08] you aren't you comforted to know that
[2:07:11] when the enemy floods your life the
[2:07:13] spirit of the Lord will raise up a flag
[2:07:15] against him
[2:07:22] that's the word
[2:07:25] give me one
[2:07:28] let me see how many demons I can disturb
[2:07:30] give me a flag
[2:07:36] praise God
[2:07:41] that's the word
[2:07:46] that's the word
[2:07:47] the word standard there means a banner
[2:07:51] or a flag
[2:07:55] now it doesn't seem quite as powerful to
[2:07:59] think about it that way until you
[2:08:01] realize who's raising a flag against the
[2:08:04] devil
[2:08:05] when God raises a flag against the enemy
[2:08:09] he has no choice but to retreat don't
[2:08:14] that bless you to know that God is
[2:08:16] waving a flag in your enemy's face
[2:08:21] now how does that fit in with the
[2:08:22] message of the hour well how many of you
[2:08:24] remember I've told you about granddaddy
[2:08:26] words
[2:08:27] brother Bobby are you watching today
[2:08:31] sometimes he does
[2:08:33] it was his grandfather
[2:08:36] brother Donovan Wertz dad
[2:08:39] who had this dream experience
[2:08:42] that brother Branham tells about in the
[2:08:45] message of the hour
[2:08:47] and it's the experience with the Devil
[2:08:50] and it come like his lies and his
[2:08:53] accusations
[2:08:55] and as the enemy began to speak against
[2:08:58] granddaddy words in this dream
[2:09:01] experience
[2:09:02] he starts getting littler Papa Works
[2:09:05] granddaddy word he starts getting
[2:09:07] smaller and the enemy starts getting
[2:09:09] bigger
[2:09:11] Every Lie of the enemy shrunk him
[2:09:15] and magnified the enemy does anybody
[2:09:17] believe that's a Dream from the Lord
[2:09:20] I do
[2:09:21] because that's my life
[2:09:23] somebody told my life story this is how
[2:09:27] it works in our everyday life every time
[2:09:30] we take the enemy's lie in accusation it
[2:09:33] shrinks us and it gives him more
[2:09:35] Authority remember he's just a tool in
[2:09:37] the hand of God to perfect the Saints
[2:09:40] and so if you take if you take authority
[2:09:43] over the tool
[2:09:47] and so this thing turned around and I
[2:09:50] don't have it in front of me I don't
[2:09:51] think I do that that I could read it to
[2:09:54] you quickly I'll just do a quick search
[2:09:56] here on my amazing notes
[2:10:01] the problem is it brings up it brings up
[2:10:03] book
[2:10:04] for boo
[2:10:07] anybody could find that I don't want to
[2:10:09] take the time
[2:10:11] but I'm I think maybe so oh here we go
[2:10:14] no I have pulled here the
[2:10:17] the quote for brother Bobby's dad
[2:10:19] brother Donovan getting his healing and
[2:10:22] brother Branham prayed for him
[2:10:24] and and I hear and I say uh that I do
[2:10:27] know Granddaddy's name now I'd forgotten
[2:10:29] it William words
[2:10:31] I've got that but I don't see a a
[2:10:34] particular
[2:10:35] quotation here
[2:10:40] could we could we see if we could find
[2:10:42] that charity from God commissioning
[2:10:44] Moses night I got so many things going
[2:10:47] at one time I'll never remember where I
[2:10:49] am
[2:10:51] thank you sister Beverly
[2:10:57] paragraph 27 does that help at all
[2:11:03] now remember take it believe it put your
[2:11:06] faith and turn it loose Yonder with God
[2:11:09] and the Holy Ghost will come upon you he
[2:11:11] promised it then brother the devil
[2:11:14] looked like a little bitty fellow see
[2:11:16] when he began to take the authority of
[2:11:18] faith and turn it against the enemy
[2:11:20] speak the word of God the Holy Ghost
[2:11:23] come upon then brother the devil looked
[2:11:25] like a little bitty fellow he began to
[2:11:27] shrink as that Faith begin to say boo
[2:11:31] devil boo devil boo devil that's all he
[2:11:35] had to say
[2:11:37] why because the authority wasn't in his
[2:11:39] words The Authority was in his life
[2:11:42] The Authority was who lived in his shoe
[2:11:45] leather
[2:11:46] so it didn't matter if he formed the
[2:11:48] words just right a simple Blue Devil
[2:11:51] shrunk him down a man was telling me the
[2:11:54] other night that he said he had a dream
[2:11:55] and said he dreamed the devil was a
[2:11:57] little bitty Old Devil got after him and
[2:12:00] he said the devil said boo and he jumped
[2:12:02] back and every time he jumped back the
[2:12:04] devil got bigger
[2:12:06] he jumped back he jumped back he jumped
[2:12:08] back and the devil got bigger and bigger
[2:12:10] all the time and after a while he knowed
[2:12:13] he had to fight the devil so the only
[2:12:15] thing he had to do then he said he'd
[2:12:16] just reach over and got the Bible
[2:12:18] and he kept backing back he said he made
[2:12:21] a hit at him and the devil started
[2:12:23] getting littler
[2:12:24] [Music]
[2:12:27] is that too silly for some of you
[2:12:28] theologians
[2:12:30] isn't that good
[2:12:32] [Music]
[2:12:33] he just began to take
[2:12:39] new Devil
[2:12:42] he said he made a hit at him and the
[2:12:44] devil started getting littler going down
[2:12:46] said he knowed he had to fight him
[2:12:48] sometime
[2:12:49] brother every time he hollers Boo and
[2:12:52] you jump back
[2:12:54] he'll just keep getting bigger
[2:12:56] oh
[2:12:58] this is deeper than a whole lot of
[2:13:01] people realize
[2:13:03] he'll just keep getting bigger but when
[2:13:05] you take God's word and stand there and
[2:13:07] say the saith the Lord it's written he
[2:13:11] will what
[2:13:13] he will take his fly he will get littler
[2:13:16] look up there and say well looky here
[2:13:18] what kind of condition are you in
[2:13:20] I'm looking at this I'm looking to what
[2:13:23] he said amen God had promised David got
[2:13:26] this little sling picked up five Stone
[2:13:28] put one in the slingshot oh Goliath
[2:13:30] looked over to him and said well what am
[2:13:32] I a dog look what's coming to fight me
[2:13:34] he didn't understand what it was all
[2:13:36] about how many of you know it only took
[2:13:38] I'll I'll finish it I guess he said why
[2:13:41] today he cursed him in the name of his
[2:13:43] gods and he said why today I'll give
[2:13:45] your flesh to the birds David said you
[2:13:47] meet me as a Philistine in the name of a
[2:13:49] Philistine with an arm and a spear but I
[2:13:52] meet you in the name of the Lord God of
[2:13:55] Israel and this day God will give me
[2:14:00] this day God will give you into my hands
[2:14:03] isn't that what he said now back to
[2:14:06] Isaiah if you'll pull that verse up I
[2:14:08] remembered
[2:14:10] so nobody has a problem believing that
[2:14:13] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[2:14:15] spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[2:14:17] standard raise up a flag raise up a
[2:14:20] banner against him
[2:14:25] so if you should ever use that if you
[2:14:27] ever wave your little flag you just
[2:14:29] remember you're just doing what the Lord
[2:14:31] has to do sometime
[2:14:33] to push the enemy back out of your life
[2:14:36] don't hit anybody in the face with it
[2:14:38] and don't get between us and the camera
[2:14:40] that happens sometime during worship in
[2:14:42] the in the the precious streamers will
[2:14:45] rot in and say I love the worship but
[2:14:47] please ask them not to stand here
[2:14:49] because then it blocks them from being
[2:14:51] able to see what's going on in the
[2:14:53] worship and remember they're on the
[2:14:55] other end just gasping grasping to try
[2:14:58] to get a little piece of the service and
[2:15:00] they want to feel as connected as they
[2:15:02] possibly can but you get off in the
[2:15:04] corner somewhere if you need to and you
[2:15:06] show the enemy
[2:15:08] what he's about to have to swallow if he
[2:15:11] doesn't get out of your life with his
[2:15:13] flood
[2:15:14] right so I believe that just like it's
[2:15:16] written and I wouldn't try to change it
[2:15:18] for nothing in the world but that is not
[2:15:20] how it reads in the original
[2:15:24] when you start breaking those words down
[2:15:27] and you follow
[2:15:29] the the the parts of speech in Hebrew
[2:15:33] you find out that that's not where the
[2:15:36] if you're going to put a comma at all
[2:15:37] that's not really where the comma should
[2:15:40] go and when you get that in your heart I
[2:15:42] tell you it'll make you jump a little
[2:15:43] higher than you've been jumping because
[2:15:45] if we place that just like it ought to
[2:15:48] be here is how it would read when the
[2:15:51] enemy shall come in
[2:15:54] comma
[2:15:58] hello
[2:15:59] [Applause]
[2:16:01] when the enemy shall come in
[2:16:04] comma like a flood the spirit of the
[2:16:08] Lord shall lift up a standard against
[2:16:12] him
[2:16:14] won't you come like you promised Lord
[2:16:18] won't you come like a flood
[2:16:21] and push back the enemy
[2:16:26] [Applause]
[2:16:27] there it is in the word
[2:16:29] so when we get to this quote in the
[2:16:32] bride coming of Christ I've had people
[2:16:34] challenge me there and it is the rising
[2:16:36] of the sun because the comma is where it
[2:16:39] is and they say well that's not talking
[2:16:41] about uh uh the bride coming it's just
[2:16:44] the kind of the way the comma is but I
[2:16:46] believe it is
[2:16:47] he said in the bride
[2:16:50] they place a comma there paragraph 94.
[2:16:54] it is the rising of the Sun
[2:16:56] in the bride comma coming of Christ I
[2:17:00] believe we can leave that comma out all
[2:17:02] together
[2:17:03] in the bride coming of Christ
[2:17:06] coming out of the church there'll have
[2:17:10] to be a chief waved again in the last
[2:17:15] days oh my
[2:17:18] that's a prophet coming to maternity but
[2:17:22] it's more than that
[2:17:24] in the last of the last days it's a
[2:17:27] people
[2:17:30] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[2:17:33] the bride is the mystery of Christ
[2:17:36] revealed so it actually goes from one
[2:17:39] to a multiplication
[2:17:42] you said Hallelujah I'm sure you see
[2:17:45] what I'm talking about it was waived
[2:17:48] over the people
[2:17:50] and the first time there will come forth
[2:17:52] for the bride age for a resurrection out
[2:17:55] of dark denominationalism will be a
[2:17:57] message that the full maturity of the
[2:18:00] word has turned back again in its full
[2:18:03] power
[2:18:04] and being waived over the people
[2:18:07] oh that's what the word coming did and
[2:18:10] the word coming produces the bride
[2:18:11] coming so that's where we are being
[2:18:14] waived over the People by the same signs
[2:18:17] how will we know how will we know that
[2:18:19] the word is with that prophet
[2:18:22] by the same signs and wonders that they
[2:18:24] did back then and by his desire to stay
[2:18:27] in the word how will we know that a
[2:18:30] bride has come forth by the same signs
[2:18:33] and wonders that identified Christ in
[2:18:35] his first coming
[2:18:37] he will identify himself and his people
[2:18:39] in his last coming
[2:18:44] it's a multiplication it's not shrinking
[2:18:47] it's a multiplication put one seed in
[2:18:49] the ground you get a harvest you don't
[2:18:51] put one in get one out how many of you
[2:18:54] know you'd lose a lot of of a vision and
[2:18:57] a lot of energy for for Farming
[2:19:00] if you put one seed in and got one ear
[2:19:02] of corn out no no no you put one in
[2:19:05] knowing that you're going to get a stock
[2:19:07] and on that stock is going to be
[2:19:09] multiple years and on each year
[2:19:12] it's going to be a multiplication of
[2:19:14] seed that's bride somebody say that's
[2:19:17] bride
[2:19:18] that's bride now go go down to does God
[2:19:22] change his mind and we're going to come
[2:19:24] to a close shortly this morning
[2:19:32] there is always a
[2:19:35] Collision because they run right head on
[2:19:38] into each other and Israel here what I
[2:19:41] want to represent it as a spiritual
[2:19:43] church and Moab is a natural church just
[2:19:46] the church what we call Church natural
[2:19:49] and and we're all sure that there is a
[2:19:53] church and there is a bride coming out
[2:19:57] of that church
[2:20:01] we know that is true
[2:20:05] and they Clash here and we notice when
[2:20:09] they Clash here it comes under something
[2:20:13] that I would like to speak a moment on
[2:20:15] as soon as they clashed and one seen
[2:20:17] what the other one was doing there was a
[2:20:19] great impersonation
[2:20:22] one of the other
[2:20:25] wait a minute I want you to get that
[2:20:32] that is
[2:20:34] Church
[2:20:35] impersonating bribed
[2:20:38] and unfortunately some of the Bride
[2:20:42] impersonating the church
[2:20:48] no wonder brother Branham had to scream
[2:20:52] get back in line little bride
[2:20:55] because they tried to take the Church of
[2:20:58] the message
[2:20:59] the worship where the work where the
[2:21:02] Bride Comes To Worship and they try to
[2:21:04] make that look more and more like
[2:21:07] a Seeker sensitive or Seeker friendly
[2:21:10] denominational church so what you've got
[2:21:13] is you've got the church impersonating
[2:21:14] the bride and unfortunately a portion of
[2:21:17] the Bride trying to impersonate the
[2:21:19] church it will never work
[2:21:24] it's going to cause a bigger Clash
[2:21:27] than what we originally expected
[2:21:31] there was a great impersonation one of
[2:21:34] the other now paragraph 20 and that's
[2:21:36] where we find it today
[2:21:38] that we do get too much impersonations
[2:21:42] and when you do that you're always in
[2:21:44] trouble you cannot live the other
[2:21:46] fellow's life we cannot impersonate
[2:21:49] something we must be just what we are so
[2:21:54] if your church
[2:21:56] we expect you to manifest Church entity
[2:22:00] and if your bride you are expected to
[2:22:04] manifest Bridal life
[2:22:07] amen and that's what we find it today
[2:22:10] now he said you must have never if this
[2:22:12] fellow does something because he does it
[2:22:15] you think you have to do it too
[2:22:18] or you have to too you don't do that
[2:22:21] watch
[2:22:23] you're an individual to God
[2:22:26] and we mustn't try here we need to
[2:22:28] listen
[2:22:29] we mustn't try to impersonate one
[2:22:32] another so there's an impersonation of
[2:22:34] church to bride you've got some bride
[2:22:36] members get out of line and they try to
[2:22:38] impersonate church and then you've got
[2:22:40] people in The Bride that will sometimes
[2:22:42] fall victim to impersonating one another
[2:22:46] brother Branham taught us you want to
[2:22:47] make sure you get the genuine Holy
[2:22:49] Spirit you don't get your pastor spirit
[2:22:57] you don't have to shout like I shout
[2:23:00] you don't have to move like I move dress
[2:23:03] like I dress
[2:23:05] you don't have to wear a bolo tie
[2:23:07] because brother Branham did
[2:23:10] if you like boots and want to wear boots
[2:23:12] wear boots but don't wear them because
[2:23:13] he did
[2:23:17] you don't have to cover up your bald
[2:23:19] head because he did
[2:23:25] you can just be you
[2:23:27] don't try to impersonate the prophet
[2:23:29] don't try to impersonate one another
[2:23:31] don't try to impersonate another church
[2:23:34] let God do for you what you need and
[2:23:37] then be who God made you to be
[2:23:40] now that doesn't mean that you don't
[2:23:42] have a sense of responsibility to live
[2:23:44] by the standard of the church you are
[2:23:46] very obligated
[2:23:49] you are obligated by the word and by the
[2:23:52] message of the hour to honor and respect
[2:23:54] the standard of Holiness that is set in
[2:23:57] the local Sovereign Church
[2:24:01] can I have a few more amens
[2:24:03] from somebody that didn't amen earlier
[2:24:06] one more time one two three
[2:24:09] yes
[2:24:11] so don't think that you've got your
[2:24:13] individuality gives you a license
[2:24:17] to have your own standard of living and
[2:24:19] own way of of producing holiness
[2:24:22] you've got to respect the house where
[2:24:25] God has placed you
[2:24:27] so let's get at it
[2:24:30] now in the message the token I'm almost
[2:24:32] done
[2:24:33] paragraph 90
[2:24:36] the first thing they've got to
[2:24:39] to thoroughly identify that the hour was
[2:24:42] at hand was a prophet with a message
[2:24:46] Moses came down with a message the word
[2:24:49] of God was with Moses
[2:24:52] we believe that don't we the next thing
[2:24:55] Moses had to be identified and he was
[2:24:58] identified how by a pillar of fire that
[2:25:02] identified his work that God had sent
[2:25:04] him and Moses had the word of God even
[2:25:08] to create things and to bring them upon
[2:25:11] the earth and the token that God gave
[2:25:15] them by the blood was the identification
[2:25:18] or the Assurance rather that they would
[2:25:21] be passed over in the time of death
[2:25:24] there has to be a token is that right
[2:25:27] the same thing has happened today same
[2:25:29] thing the word of God has been brought
[2:25:31] to us amen the pillar of fire is Among
[2:25:35] Us amen identifying Jesus Christ raised
[2:25:39] from the dead the same yesterday today
[2:25:42] and forever and the Assurance of the
[2:25:46] baptism of the Holy Ghost Upon Our
[2:25:48] Hearts putting our love to God The
[2:25:50] Exodus
[2:25:52] is on again
[2:25:55] Israel coming out as I said is a type
[2:25:58] like the church coming out or the bride
[2:26:01] coming out of the church the bride will
[2:26:03] be the remnant will be the little group
[2:26:05] the selected the predestinated if you
[2:26:08] believe that's amen and it's not because
[2:26:10] who she is it's because she is him
[2:26:16] it's not because of who she is it's
[2:26:19] because she is him
[2:26:21] it's because she carries his life
[2:26:24] and the last one for you that are awake
[2:26:27] three kinds of believers
[2:26:29] paragraph 97.
[2:26:32] that's the reason I do believe
[2:26:35] that when the bride is called out and
[2:26:37] elected and said in the Book of Life
[2:26:39] there will come a sound from Heaven
[2:26:41] that'll take such a baptism of the Holy
[2:26:44] Ghost or the Holy Spirit into that bride
[2:26:47] that'll take her from the Earth
[2:26:50] read it
[2:26:53] in a rapturing Grace
[2:26:55] God
[2:26:57] promised it don't care how many science
[2:27:01] and how many astronauts they signed up
[2:27:04] and everything else and how many million
[2:27:07] miles they can see I don't care nothing
[2:27:10] about that there is a Heaven There is a
[2:27:14] literal Jesus Christ
[2:27:17] there there that will come in a body
[2:27:19] form to that's that's the that's the
[2:27:22] bridegroom coming
[2:27:24] in a body form to receive his church to
[2:27:27] himself no matter how old the story
[2:27:29] seems it's still the truth God said so
[2:27:31] that's what believers
[2:27:36] why don't you try telling your neighbor
[2:27:37] that sometime that's just what Believers
[2:27:39] believe
[2:27:40] I don't know
[2:27:46] yeah the young man that came here one
[2:27:48] time that grew up in a Southern Baptist
[2:27:50] School
[2:27:51] and he used to add a verse to the song
[2:27:55] uh what what is that song I've got the
[2:27:58] oh I've got the peace that passes
[2:28:00] understanding down in my heart
[2:28:03] I've got the
[2:28:05] Blessed how's that love of my blessed
[2:28:08] her oh I have the wonderful love of my
[2:28:11] Blessed Redeemer way down in the depths
[2:28:12] of my heart
[2:28:13] he said he used to sing a verse that
[2:28:15] said I have the belief of the Believers
[2:28:17] it baffles the Baptist way down in the
[2:28:19] depths of my heart
[2:28:21] because he grew up in a Baptist School
[2:28:24] and they were always telling him there
[2:28:25] was nothing to the Holy Ghost and he'd
[2:28:28] try to help him the best way he could
[2:28:29] but it was never enough so he just added
[2:28:31] a verse to the song I have the belief of
[2:28:33] the Believers that baffles the Baptist
[2:28:35] way down in the depths of my heart
[2:28:36] that's not slinging at anybody
[2:28:39] that's just what Believers believe
[2:28:42] are there any believers here
[2:28:45] yes
[2:28:48] so I wanted to close with this
[2:28:52] there's three phases of this eating of
[2:28:55] the book
[2:28:57] we won't have time to talk about them in
[2:28:59] depth but I just want to leave them with
[2:29:00] you in summary so that we can get to
[2:29:02] them Tuesday night
[2:29:04] if there's anything I know about that
[2:29:09] eating this word
[2:29:11] is it starts off in the mouth
[2:29:15] very very sweet
[2:29:19] but once it gets down to the belly
[2:29:24] what are we talking about we're talking
[2:29:25] about Revelation 10 10.
[2:29:27] and I took the little book out of the
[2:29:29] Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[2:29:31] my mouth sweet as honey
[2:29:33] and as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[2:29:35] was what
[2:29:36] bitter
[2:29:39] it's during the word coming of Christ
[2:29:43] that that Revelation becomes so sweet
[2:29:48] in our mouth
[2:29:51] when you first came to the message of
[2:29:54] the hour out of your denominational
[2:29:55] Traditions you just loved this truth
[2:29:58] those of you who came from other some of
[2:30:01] you were raised in the God help you you
[2:30:03] were raised in the message
[2:30:05] but some of you came from other things
[2:30:08] let me see your hand if you came from
[2:30:10] other Pentecostals or denominations of
[2:30:13] some kind or Catholic or some some
[2:30:15] Catholic some Presbyterian some Lutheran
[2:30:18] some heathen
[2:30:19] we always want to get the denomination
[2:30:21] of heathen in brother Shane ought to
[2:30:24] held up his hand that was my church I
[2:30:26] was at the church of the Heathen you
[2:30:28] know
[2:30:29] a lot of Truth in that you know we we
[2:30:32] some of us was in church on Sunday and
[2:30:34] was living like a heathen the rest of
[2:30:36] the time too
[2:30:37] but but when you begin to eat something
[2:30:40] by when I heard that the Rapture was not
[2:30:43] just a bam and all the Lord
[2:30:45] it it thrilled me
[2:30:49] when I could see the breaking down of
[2:30:52] the phases of rapture
[2:30:54] that it was the Lord coming first in a
[2:30:56] shout and then in a voice
[2:30:58] and then in a trumpet
[2:31:00] it it it it was it was like a a
[2:31:04] five-course meal
[2:31:07] so sweet to understand the godhead to to
[2:31:12] to never have to fear missing the
[2:31:15] Rapture again
[2:31:17] that set me free
[2:31:19] I've told you so many times as the
[2:31:22] musicians are preparing to come on
[2:31:24] I've told you so many times that as a
[2:31:27] child we would have these amazing
[2:31:29] services like we had here Tuesday night
[2:31:32] where uh seems like a kangaroo anointing
[2:31:35] got on us here Tuesday night
[2:31:38] and there were people jumping up and
[2:31:40] down and praising the Lord and
[2:31:44] you you might have caught that on the
[2:31:46] stream somebody might have caught that
[2:31:49] in they might have thought my that's a
[2:31:51] bunch of out of order
[2:31:59] I know some of you never read my text
[2:32:02] on Friday because it was too long
[2:32:06] you you you you you had to scroll
[2:32:08] through Facebook and Instagram you
[2:32:10] didn't have time to read a good long
[2:32:12] text like that
[2:32:15] so I'll just take your time now that
[2:32:16] I've got you lock the doors Joshua
[2:32:19] you're going out to lock the door good
[2:32:20] thank you
[2:32:23] let me read this
[2:32:25] you know that's what's the matter with
[2:32:27] the church today
[2:32:28] it don't get in the spirit enough
[2:32:32] and then he gives us a reason why we
[2:32:34] don't get in the spirit enough we're too
[2:32:36] much in ourselves
[2:32:38] my if you'll just get out of yourself
[2:32:40] long enough you say well you know our
[2:32:42] church is we have a regular routine
[2:32:45] brother bam said all who cares about
[2:32:47] your routine
[2:32:49] amen if you you don't have to pull it up
[2:32:52] because everybody's got it on their
[2:32:54] phones
[2:32:56] unless they deleted it
[2:33:00] let me ask you in your uh in in your uh
[2:33:04] knockoff phones you people that have
[2:33:06] those knockoff phones
[2:33:09] did the text all come in one or did you
[2:33:11] have to expand it
[2:33:15] hello
[2:33:20] no worry brother God bless you
[2:33:24] I'm just in that kind of mood
[2:33:30] did you have to expand it or did it all
[2:33:32] come in one did you have to click on it
[2:33:33] to make it bigger
[2:33:36] so it is in one text but is it all there
[2:33:39] or do you have to click on it to make it
[2:33:40] uh wonderful
[2:33:44] you see I work so hard
[2:33:48] to bring this down to 1600 characters
[2:33:51] because it says you're not guaranteed
[2:33:54] for it to go through on a on an Android
[2:33:56] if it's more than is there sixteen
[2:33:59] hundred eighteen hundred it'll send me a
[2:34:01] warning message every time and I just
[2:34:03] thought I'm tired of all this work
[2:34:06] for these knockoff phones
[2:34:09] so I run a test with sister Joyce and it
[2:34:12] worked on hers and I said then it ought
[2:34:13] to work on everybody's so let me read it
[2:34:16] to you now
[2:34:18] my if you'll just get out of yourself
[2:34:21] long enough you say well you know our
[2:34:23] church we have a regular routine who
[2:34:25] cares about your routine
[2:34:28] I wish you'd get out of the routine long
[2:34:30] enough to get saved anyhow amen
[2:34:39] you think your preacher's heart
[2:34:42] he said get saved get out of the routine
[2:34:44] we don't care about the routine get in
[2:34:47] the spirit then you can see things done
[2:34:52] did you all hear what brother Greely
[2:34:55] said about running
[2:34:58] he said you may take over and you may
[2:35:00] not feel anything right then
[2:35:04] I wish you all to preach a message on
[2:35:06] that sometime
[2:35:08] because people around this message are
[2:35:11] always waiting on something to move them
[2:35:13] and
[2:35:15] I'll praise the Lord when I get moved
[2:35:20] to praise the lord we bring a sacrifice
[2:35:23] of praise we praise him not because we
[2:35:26] feel anything we praise him because he's
[2:35:29] worthy
[2:35:31] and look what happens when you start
[2:35:33] praising him you start feeling him
[2:35:38] you know that thing that gets on you
[2:35:40] that says run you ought to run you ought
[2:35:41] to run you ought to run you know that
[2:35:43] thing that gets on you may not feel
[2:35:45] anything but that that you feel there's
[2:35:47] a little something an urge or a call or
[2:35:49] a pull or a thought that comes to your
[2:35:51] mind you know God can speak to you in
[2:35:53] your own thoughts sometime oh yes
[2:35:56] and you step out in faith and God
[2:35:59] blesses that so many people said well I
[2:36:01] would dance before the Lord if he moved
[2:36:03] on me to do so well I want you to know
[2:36:06] it doesn't always come in that order
[2:36:08] sometimes we bring God a sacrifice of
[2:36:11] praise sometimes we dance before the
[2:36:14] Lord because we read the Psalms and it
[2:36:16] says dance
[2:36:20] it may not look like much
[2:36:23] I've never danced for in the world in my
[2:36:25] life I don't know them moves
[2:36:28] I can tell some of you used to dance for
[2:36:30] the devil
[2:36:33] God has redeemed some of your moves
[2:36:36] but I didn't have none I never danced
[2:36:39] like that
[2:36:40] so it may not look like much but I'm not
[2:36:43] trying to look like anything
[2:36:45] I just read where the Bible said praise
[2:36:48] the Lord in the dance
[2:36:50] [Applause]
[2:36:52] I didn't read where it said wait till I
[2:36:54] come on you and squeeze you until you
[2:36:58] cannot refuse to dance
[2:37:01] it just said praise the Lord in the
[2:37:03] dance
[2:37:04] so sometimes people are standing on the
[2:37:06] on the shore on the bank waiting to feel
[2:37:09] something
[2:37:11] and never do
[2:37:13] where if they just do what the psalm
[2:37:14] says the Psalms will tell you how to
[2:37:16] praise the Lord you don't get to choose
[2:37:17] how you pray he tells us how to pray
[2:37:19] just obey the word you'll be all right
[2:37:21] my
[2:37:25] I wish you'd get out of that routine we
[2:37:28] don't care about the routine get in the
[2:37:29] spirit then you can see things done he
[2:37:32] said an old Prophet one time got all
[2:37:34] stirred up because somebody came to him
[2:37:36] it wasn't right for him to come he kind
[2:37:39] of got his righteous indignation up and
[2:37:41] you know what he did before the Spirit
[2:37:43] come on him
[2:37:46] he had to go sing some good spiritual
[2:37:49] songs
[2:37:51] then he got in the spirit
[2:37:56] I I got a hush but I used to hear them
[2:37:59] say oh yes sure they're dancing now
[2:38:02] they got worked up by the music
[2:38:05] you stopped the music and let's see what
[2:38:07] they do
[2:38:08] we're not playing with these things you
[2:38:11] can run experiments in your place we're
[2:38:14] not running any experiments here
[2:38:17] because I'm not dancing because there's
[2:38:19] music
[2:38:20] come on
[2:38:21] [Music]
[2:38:22] I'm going to read it just like he said
[2:38:24] it he said before the Spirit come on him
[2:38:27] he had to go sing some good spiritual
[2:38:29] songs
[2:38:30] then he got in the spirit and he began
[2:38:33] to see things
[2:38:35] he saw some Visions I tell you brother
[2:38:37] hey
[2:38:39] life will look a lot different when the
[2:38:42] church gets in the spirit that's right
[2:38:44] he said and gets out of itself and that
[2:38:47] routine you're in amen
[2:38:50] paragraph 37 lay aside those weights you
[2:38:52] got to find out the ladies Aid Society
[2:38:54] has got their dinner next week and what
[2:38:57] you got to do
[2:38:58] people get so worked up
[2:39:04] in the most carnal little thing
[2:39:11] you need examples
[2:39:17] lay aside those things
[2:39:20] give time to old-fashioned heartfelt
[2:39:23] pouring out of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:39:24] until the Holy Ghost pours down upon
[2:39:27] your souls
[2:39:33] you'll get beside yourself
[2:39:36] what
[2:39:43] I thought we wasn't supposed to get
[2:39:45] beside ourselves but the man said you
[2:39:47] will
[2:39:51] get beside yourself
[2:39:53] maybe you can get with Jesus if you get
[2:39:56] away from yourself once
[2:39:58] amen
[2:39:59] he said you can't be yourself be with
[2:40:02] yourself and Jesus you find out you're
[2:40:05] the biggest enemy you got
[2:40:06] isn't that the truth if I can get
[2:40:09] William Branham out of the way Jesus can
[2:40:11] have a wonderful time but you've got to
[2:40:12] get him out of the way
[2:40:14] you believe brother Branham struggled oh
[2:40:16] he sure did so then you start see they
[2:40:19] started throwing light-footed feeling
[2:40:21] wonderful why they were following the
[2:40:23] pillar of fire god going before them and
[2:40:26] when he cut away through the Red Sea and
[2:40:28] she walked up and when they got on the
[2:40:30] other side and got back to Earth again
[2:40:31] their feet on the ground they look
[2:40:34] around after the spirit went off of them
[2:40:36] and they seen what had happened
[2:40:39] they got excited they got so excited
[2:40:42] till Moses raised up his hands and began
[2:40:44] to sing in the spirit
[2:40:46] a song that had never been written
[2:40:49] see and Miriam his sister the prophetess
[2:40:52] really a woman
[2:40:55] could prophesy
[2:40:57] could carry an office of a prophetess oh
[2:41:01] my
[2:41:02] that was the celebrity of the crowd amen
[2:41:05] she got so excited she grabbed a
[2:41:07] tambourine and began to beat the
[2:41:08] tambourine and dance notice brother
[2:41:11] Brennan said after the Spirit came off
[2:41:13] of them
[2:41:16] he said after the Spirit came off of
[2:41:19] them
[2:41:21] they weren't dancing because the spirit
[2:41:23] was making them
[2:41:24] they were dancing because when they got
[2:41:26] out from under the spirit they
[2:41:27] recognized what God had done while they
[2:41:30] were in the spirit that gave them more
[2:41:32] reason to dance
[2:41:34] and the daughters of Israel followed her
[2:41:36] up and down the banks beating the
[2:41:38] tambourine and dancing Hallelujah he
[2:41:40] said if that ain't an old-fashioned
[2:41:42] Pentecostal camp meeting I'd never seen
[2:41:44] one in my life brother if this is the
[2:41:46] latter rain that must have been the
[2:41:48] former Reign hallelujah what is it the
[2:41:50] same Holy Ghost same Pillar of Fire same
[2:41:53] Redeemer walking in light moving on
[2:41:56] what a Time
[2:42:00] a lot of time
[2:42:03] it's one thing to eat that word and it
[2:42:06] be sweet in your mouth
[2:42:08] but the Perfection of the Bride is not
[2:42:10] coming because the word was sweet in
[2:42:12] your mouth the Perfection of the Bride
[2:42:14] starts coming once it gets down into the
[2:42:16] innermost being and starts turning you
[2:42:18] sick
[2:42:19] because it's asking you for something
[2:42:23] that word is requiring something a total
[2:42:26] surrender from unbelief
[2:42:29] a total deliverance from unbelief are
[2:42:32] you ready Bill a total deliverance from
[2:42:35] unbelief
[2:42:36] and when that starts getting down in
[2:42:37] there and it starts changing the way you
[2:42:39] celebrate your holidays
[2:42:42] and the way you dress and the way you
[2:42:44] live your everyday life it starts
[2:42:45] getting bitter in the belly
[2:42:48] but it is necessary for this word
[2:42:51] to transition from the sweetness of your
[2:42:53] mouth to the bitterness of your belly
[2:42:55] because the last of Revelation 10 gives
[2:42:58] you your commission
[2:42:59] we see brother branham's commission we
[2:43:01] see the commission Angel the Covenant we
[2:43:04] see what John had to do in Revelation 10
[2:43:06] but there's something you and I will
[2:43:08] have to do
[2:43:10] prophesy again
[2:43:13] prophesy again
[2:43:15] and you can't let something come up
[2:43:19] that hasn't gone in
[2:43:21] so John experienced that when he started
[2:43:24] eating that book it tasted like
[2:43:25] honeycomb then he swallowed it
[2:43:29] see as long as you just make yourself a
[2:43:31] friend of the message
[2:43:34] Guilty By Association only
[2:43:37] it'll just be sweet to you
[2:43:40] you sell out and start living it
[2:43:42] cover up your nakedness when you're in
[2:43:44] the world
[2:43:45] you start making some changes in your
[2:43:47] life and what was sweet in the beginning
[2:43:49] they'll get down there in your belly and
[2:43:51] start costing you something and you'll
[2:43:53] feel like you need to be sick
[2:43:59] and then you'll want to spit up
[2:44:01] you'll want to let that out that's
[2:44:03] turning around you just ask some of them
[2:44:05] that's been sick and they'll tell you
[2:44:07] you don't want to leave that down in
[2:44:08] there you want to get rid of it and
[2:44:10] that's exactly what God had in mind I'll
[2:44:13] give them a message that's so sweet that
[2:44:15] they'll want to chew it and once they
[2:44:17] chew it it'll get down their belly it'll
[2:44:18] start costing them something they'll go
[2:44:20] through a period of time it'll look like
[2:44:23] to the world that they're just laying in
[2:44:24] the sun ripening and nothing really much
[2:44:27] is going on because the world won't be
[2:44:29] able to see what's taking place on the
[2:44:31] inside but in that very last of the last
[2:44:33] days that which has been churning on the
[2:44:36] inside of them will start coming out and
[2:44:38] they will prophesy again to many
[2:44:40] kindreds many tongues many people come
[2:44:42] on that's when the message will do what
[2:44:45] the prophet said it will sweep through
[2:44:47] Asia coming out of the West Coast it'll
[2:44:50] sweep through Asia Korea Japan and all
[2:44:53] the way back to the city of Jerusalem
[2:44:55] where it started this move of God
[2:44:58] started on the day of Pentecost travel
[2:45:00] out in Jerusalem the cycle is not
[2:45:03] complete until it comes home
[2:45:07] that's what he said
[2:45:08] and that mean it had to go it had to
[2:45:10] move all the way you must go west
[2:45:14] it had to go all the way the West how
[2:45:16] many of you know when you leave the
[2:45:17] coast of California and you start moving
[2:45:21] it's not long before you're moving you
[2:45:24] just continue to move on you start
[2:45:25] moving through the east
[2:45:29] he said it circles the globe
[2:45:32] and he said it has to come through Asia
[2:45:35] which is a nation that's just now
[2:45:37] beginning to wake up
[2:45:40] a continent just now waking up the the
[2:45:43] message just now striking Japan after
[2:45:46] all of these years
[2:45:48] I told you many years ago about a man
[2:45:51] who came here and wrote a check for a
[2:45:53] hundred thousand dollars and asked me to
[2:45:56] relocate with my family and take the
[2:45:58] message to Japan and he would not only
[2:46:01] give me that offering but pay for all of
[2:46:03] my expenses
[2:46:05] and it was not the will of the Lord but
[2:46:07] it expressed his desire for God to do
[2:46:10] something in Japan
[2:46:11] and when it got time for God to begin to
[2:46:14] do something in Japan look what he did
[2:46:16] he sent two little ladies here from
[2:46:18] Japan to be baptized in the name of the
[2:46:21] Lord Jesus Christ and now they tell me
[2:46:24] there's more than one group but I'm in
[2:46:27] contact with the one group where sister
[2:46:29] emiko is and where sister fousey and
[2:46:33] Koya are that little group is growing
[2:46:36] and God is blessing them and expanding
[2:46:38] but it's just the infancy it's just the
[2:46:40] beginning and Korea that has had a
[2:46:43] mighty Prayer Revival has not had a
[2:46:45] great outpouring yet of the message of
[2:46:48] the hour
[2:46:49] but he allowed seeds to be planted in
[2:46:52] the early 90s
[2:46:54] I was in Korea and we saw the seed beds
[2:46:58] of Revival beginning to form
[2:47:02] and so there is yet to be that Asia
[2:47:05] Awakening
[2:47:07] but it's coming
[2:47:09] and when it's finished its way through
[2:47:11] those Asian continents and countries
[2:47:13] what is it do it goes right back to the
[2:47:15] city where it all started
[2:47:18] God anointing two Prophets
[2:47:22] to take that message to the Jewish
[2:47:25] people
[2:47:26] the bride slipping out of here oh my
[2:47:30] let's stand we're nearer home
