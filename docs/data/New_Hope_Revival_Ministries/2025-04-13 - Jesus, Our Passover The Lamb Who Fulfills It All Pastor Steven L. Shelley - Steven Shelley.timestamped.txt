[38:59] minister miracles where miracles are
[39:02] needed. I need a miracle in my in my
[39:05] body. How about you? Do you need one
[39:07] today? I need a miracle. And I know that
[39:10] God is the miracle worker. We want to
[39:13] remember brother Daniel out on brother
[39:15] Daniel Miller out on the road. All that
[39:17] and encircles him. We want to ask the
[39:19] Lord to be with him. Michael reached out
[39:21] and asked us to continue to pray for
[39:24] Lydia and Adelaide. They're still
[39:26] battling and need a total healing.
[39:29] Sister Jada reached out to say that they
[39:31] would be in Atlanta today celebrating
[39:33] her dad's I I don't remember without
[39:36] looking if it was 87 or 88th birthday. I
[39:39] don't remember which of the two, but he
[39:40] has Lug Garrick's disease, is not doing
[39:43] well, and they wanted to be with him
[39:44] today. pray for them going and coming.
[39:47] There are several families that will
[39:48] leave this week uh on Thursday, I
[39:51] assume, to to go to Louisiana Youth
[39:54] Camp. We want to pray for their safety
[39:56] as they go. Uh and as they come back to
[39:59] us, God be with them. Uh the last
[40:02] service there is on Sunday morning, so
[40:04] they'll be traveling back. I would think
[40:06] Sunday afternoon. Let's pray that God
[40:08] will bring them back. I know that you
[40:10] and sister Joyce are traveling this week
[40:12] to preach on two weekends now also
[40:16] coming up. Uh Benjamin and Jenna coming
[40:18] home next Saturday. Would like for them
[40:20] to be remembered to the Lord in prayer.
[40:22] And there are others who are going back
[40:25] and forth and back and forth different
[40:28] uh places for different reasons. And I
[40:31] always feel concerned because I know how
[40:34] dangerous the roads are. It seems
[40:37] they're extremely dangerous around here
[40:39] lately. Yeah. And I'm just really
[40:41] believing that God will uh let those
[40:44] angels watch over all of us and keep us.
[40:47] Uh I've had several near accidents just
[40:50] coming to the church with all the
[40:52] construction and the changes out there.
[40:54] Yes, sir. A couple times maybe as many
[40:57] as three, I've nearly been just really
[41:01] clobbered with a vehicle. I know that
[41:04] God is able to keep us all. many
[41:06] unspoken needs and people are reaching
[41:08] out and uh lives are shifting in a time
[41:11] like this. We want to pray that we all
[41:14] have the discernment of the Lord and and
[41:16] we move in his cycles and seasons and
[41:18] not out. Amen. This is not a time to be
[41:21] out of the perfect will of God. Amen.
[41:23] Amen.
[41:27] As we get ready to
[41:28] pray, I woke up this morning singing
[41:31] Great is thy faithfulness. I'd like to
[41:34] sing it before we go to prayer. I would
[41:37] like to This is the verse that I woke

[44:42] provided in
[44:46] Christ. Everything that we need to
[44:50] overcome is in
[44:54] Christ. If we need an advocate today, we
[44:57] have an advocate with the father. Jesus
[45:01] Christ the righteous. Lord, we have a
[45:05] healer.
[45:06] a provider, a
[45:09] strength, a counselor.
[45:13] Lord, I thank you that in this life you
[45:17] have not left us alone. I thank you
[45:20] today, Lord, for your presence, that
[45:23] you've come and visited your people. And
[45:26] we want you to know today that that
[45:29] you're welcome here, Lord, in this
[45:32] place.
[45:34] We lay aside every agenda, every plan,
[45:38] every thought,
[45:41] our time. Lord, we lay on the altar
[45:44] before you. And we ask that you would
[45:46] have your way today, Lord, that
[45:49] preparation would occur in your people.
[45:53] That preparation would unfold in our
[45:55] lives, Lord. That we would yield the
[45:58] right to our own
[46:00] lives. and that you would have
[46:02] preeminence.
[46:04] Lord, I just I thank so much about
[46:08] harvest.
[46:12] Lord, it's it's what's on your mind.
[46:14] It's what's on your heart. A people
[46:17] fornown that you're drawing back to
[46:20] yourself. And Lord, we just want to say
[46:23] today that we want to participate in
[46:26] that harvest. We don't want to be on the
[46:28] sidelines, Lord. And so we ask that you
[46:31] would deal with us today by your word
[46:34] and bring us into alignment with heaven,
[46:37] oh God, that your work would be
[46:40] perfected in us.
[46:44] And so we yield today to you. Heaven's
[46:47] agenda, let it be established in this
[46:50] place in the name of Yeshua, the
[46:53] Messiah. Let every opposing spirit bow
[46:57] in Jesus name.
[47:00] Yes, Lord. We're a
[47:02] people that are hungry for you. We're
[47:06] only hungry for you because you've
[47:08] placed that hunger in us, oh God. And we
[47:11] don't satisfy it today with the word
[47:14] with the world. We come to satisfy it
[47:16] with the word to feast on at the word to
[47:21] sit at your table. Oh God, I don't know.
[47:24] we just make ourselves available today
[47:28] that your will would unfold that we
[47:30] would be lifted into a new dimension in
[47:33] you.
[47:35] I know it oh God our vision often is so
[47:40] low. We we question the destiny or the
[47:44] purpose that you have for us. I pray
[47:46] today that an that eyes would be
[47:49] anointed to see that lies would be
[47:52] broken. Oh God, that your people would
[47:55] be strengthened and encouraged, that
[47:58] faith would be ignited, where in the end
[48:01] time a harvest needs to be reaped, and
[48:04] you're coming for your bride, oh God,
[48:07] and we're
[48:08] available. We're available, oh God. We
[48:12] love you today, Lord. We love you today.
[48:15] We love you today, Lord. Have your will.
[48:18] Have your way. Bring healing to
[48:21] everybody.
[48:23] Let it manifest. Bring wisdom, oh God,
[48:26] to every question. You're the answer.
[48:30] Open up ears to hear and hearts to
[48:33] understand. Lord, I know many, many of
[48:36] us in our lives, we're connected with
[48:39] people that need you. Situations that
[48:42] are desperate without you, oh God.
[48:46] Our whole lives, we're just wholly
[48:48] dependent on you, Lord.
[48:51] And we just welcome you today, Lord,
[48:53] because we know that you are faithful,
[48:56] that you are good, that you are
[48:58] righteous, that you are sovereign, that
[49:01] you rule this word, this world from
[49:04] heaven on high, oh God, and everything
[49:07] will happen according to your plan. And
[49:10] so we rest in you today. Our confession
[49:13] today is one of faith
[49:16] and
[49:17] gratitude that you finished the work
[49:20] that on the 14th of Nissan yesterday you
[49:23] paid the price. You were the lamb slain
[49:27] from the foundation of the world and you
[49:29] entered into flesh Lord and you paid the
[49:32] price and by your stripes we are healed.
[49:36] By your blood we are reconciled back
[49:39] unto God. And so we just live today in
[49:42] fellowship with you. Thankful for your
[49:45] presence, oh God.
[49:48] We're thankful for you today in Jesus
[49:51] name. Amen.
[49:55] Hallelujah. We say
[49:59] amen. Thank you
[50:02] Lord. Thank you
[50:05] Lord. Oh praise the Lord.
[50:09] Amen. You may have your seat today.
[50:15] My brother Kate is getting into position
[50:17] to sing today. We just welcome you into
[50:19] the house of the Lord. God is faithful.
[50:22] He strengthens us. Sister Anna Miller,
[50:25] we're glad to see you here with us
[50:31] today. She thumbmed a ride with her
[50:33] parents from Arkansas.

[50:40] husband, Brother Forest Farmer, is in in
[50:43] South Carolina preaching and she
[50:46] decided, Sister Sherry decided she was
[50:48] going to spend some time with the
[50:49] grandchildren. And so we're glad that
[50:51] Sister Sherry Farmer is here today with
[50:53] us. God bless
[50:58] you. If you don't know it, that's Sister
[51:00] Anna's mother. We're glad that she is
[51:03] here with us. We're glad to be gathered
[51:05] in the house of the Lord. The Lord is
[51:08] faithful to us. There a lot of folks
[51:10] that are out today and we we're praying
[51:13] for them and believing the Lord to bring
[51:15] us all back together. It seems like
[51:17] there's a lot of coming and going as
[51:19] brother Shelley has already said and
[51:20] we're praying for one another as we come
[51:23] and go but believing that that we stay
[51:26] in the purposes of God as we go as we
[51:30] come and but God called us as a part of
[51:33] this body and I'm thankful to be a part
[51:37] of this body. I'm thankful for the word
[51:39] of the Lord that is here that we are
[51:42] privileged to hear. God knew what we
[51:45] needed and he knew where to place us.
[51:47] Amen. We want to receive the tithe and
[51:50] offering today to give to the work of
[51:52] the Lord his that his purposes can be
[51:55] accomplished in the end time with in on
[51:57] on this piece of property and where he
[52:00] sends us. I'm going to ask brother
[52:02] Steven Yantis and brother Elas Chacha to
[52:04] go to the people today to uh receive of
[52:08] the tithe and the offering. Give as
[52:10] giving unto the Lord. We worship
[52:12] together with our giving and we worship
[52:14] as brother Cade sings.
[52:28] [Music]
[52:45] I faced a
[52:47] mountain that I've never faced
[52:52] before. That's why I'm calling on you,
[52:57] Lord.
[53:00] I know it's been a while, but Lord,
[53:05] please hear my
[53:07] prayer. I need you like I never
[53:12] have
[53:13] [Music]
[53:17] before. Sometimes it takes a mountain.
[53:26] Sometimes the trouble
[53:33] see, sometimes it takes a
[53:37] [Music]
[53:40] desert to get a
[53:43] hold of me.
[53:49] Your love is so much
[53:56] stronger than
[53:58] whatever trles me.
[54:05] Sometimes it takes a
[54:08] [Music]
[54:12] mountain to trust you
[54:14] and
[54:22] believe. Forgive me, Jesus.
[54:26] I thought I could
[54:28] [Music]
[54:29] control whatever life would throw upon
[54:34] my
[54:37] way. But this, I will
[54:41] admit, it has brought me to my knees. I
[54:46] need you, Lord. And I'm not
[54:49] ashamed to
[54:54] say sometimes it takes a mountain
[55:00] [Music]
[55:03] or sometimes it troubled sea.
[55:11] Sometimes it takes a
[55:17] desert to get a
[55:20] hold of
[55:25] me. Your love is so much
[55:31] [Music]
[55:33] stronger than
[55:35] whatever trles me.
[55:40] [Music]
[55:42] Sometimes it takes a mountain
[55:50] to just you
[55:51] and
[55:59] believe. Forgive me, Jesus.
[56:03] I thought I could
[56:06] control whatever life would throw upon
[56:11] my
[56:13] way. But this I will
[56:17] admit, it has brought me to my
[56:21] knees. I need you, Lord, and I'm not
[56:26] ashamed to say.
[56:31] Oh, sometimes it takes a
[56:39] mountain. Sometimes a troubled
[56:46] sea. Sometimes it
[56:49] takes a
[56:54] desert to get a
[56:57] hold of me.
[56:59] [Music]
[57:03] Your love is so much
[57:10] stronger than
[57:12] whatever troubles me.
[57:19] Sometimes it takes a
[57:26] mountain to trust you
[57:29] and
[57:33] believe. Sometimes it takes a
[57:38] [Music]
[57:41] mountain to trust you
[57:44] and believe.
[57:51] and I will
[57:52] [Music]
[57:53] trust. I will trust in
[57:56] [Music]
[57:58] you when I don't see your plans for me
[58:03] and I'm losing my
[58:06] view. I will
[58:09] trust. I will trust in you.
[58:15] Well, I'm standing still. My heart's
[58:18] been filled, but my life's been torn in
[58:21] two. I will
[58:25] trust. I will
[58:28] trust. I will trust in
[58:32] [Music]
[58:36] you. And I will
[58:39] trust, Lord. I will trust in
[58:44] you. When I don't see your plans for me
[58:49] and I'm losing my
[58:51] view, I will
[58:54] trust. Oh, I will trust in
[58:58] [Music]

[59:19] you. One more time. Oh, and I will
[59:24] trust, Lord. I will trust in
[59:29] you. When I don't see your plans for me
[59:34] and I'm losing my
[59:37] view, I will trust. I will trust. I will
[59:42] trust in you.
[59:46] I'm standing still. My heart's been
[59:49] filled, but my life's been torn in two.
[59:53] I will trust. Even still, I will trust.
[59:59] I will trust, Lord. I will trust in you.
[1:00:05] [Music]
[1:00:06] I will
[1:00:08] trust. I will trust in you. And where he
[1:00:13] leads me,
[1:00:16] I will follow.
[1:00:22] Where he
[1:00:24] leads me,
[1:00:27] I I will
[1:00:29] [Music]
[1:00:32] follow. And where he
[1:00:36] leads, he leads me.
[1:00:39] I I will
[1:00:42] follow. Yes, I will. I'll go with
[1:00:47] him. With him. I'll go with him.
[1:00:52] [Music]
[1:00:54] Oh, let's take it down once and sing it
[1:00:57] as we get our Bibles ready. And where he
[1:01:02] leads leads me,
[1:01:05] I I will
[1:01:09] follow. Where he
[1:01:13] leads, where he leads me,
[1:01:16] I I will follow.
[1:01:20] [Music]
[1:01:21] where he leads
[1:01:25] me.
[1:01:28] I will
[1:01:30] [Music]
[1:01:32] follow and I'll go with
[1:01:35] him. Yes, I'll go with
[1:01:39] him
[1:01:42] all all the
[1:01:44] way. Isn't the Lord wonderful? Isn't he
[1:01:48] good? Isn't he
[1:01:51] faithful and holy?
[1:01:57] Great is thy faithfulness.
[1:02:00] He's worthy.
[1:02:02] I'm really happy to see you in the house
[1:02:04] of the Lord this morning. I didn't
[1:02:07] anticipate that so many would be
[1:02:08] missing, but I'm very glad that you are
[1:02:11] here. I knew for the next two weeks we
[1:02:14] might be a bit slim, but uh I was
[1:02:17] expecting to be a little fuller this
[1:02:19] morning, but it is full. There's angels
[1:02:21] on every pew and the presence of the
[1:02:24] Lord is here and his word is rich and
[1:02:27] right. His presence is uh so so
[1:02:31] comforting when there may be something
[1:02:33] on your mind. If you can just get in the
[1:02:36] presence of the Lord, well, it just
[1:02:38] eases so much. We're blessed with
[1:02:40] anointed musicians. Amen. You did a
[1:02:42] great job this morning leading us in
[1:02:44] worship. Let's thank God for
[1:02:46] [Music]
[1:02:48] them. Turn to First
[1:02:51] Corinthians chapter
[1:02:53] 5 beginning in verse 7 this morning. And
[1:02:57] I will just mention that there are
[1:02:59] birthdays this week. Sister I notice
[1:03:01] that R.J.'s mom, Sister Karen, if she
[1:03:03] should happen to see this. If not, I
[1:03:05] hope somebody will pass my greetings to
[1:03:08] her. Her birthday's tomorrow. Uh, on
[1:03:10] Wednesday, Sister Man has a birthday.
[1:03:13] She has her hard cast off and and uh she
[1:03:17] can no longer use it as a weapon. Uh,
[1:03:20] but I see she's got something on there
[1:03:21] to protect her. So, let's just keep
[1:03:24] praying for her. But, uh, she has a
[1:03:26] birthday this week and we ought to
[1:03:27] mention that. And she shares a birthday
[1:03:29] with the twins. So, Lydia and Adelaide
[1:03:32] have to get better in a hurry, don't
[1:03:34] they? Because they have a birthday. I
[1:03:36] had Isaiah's birthday coming up this
[1:03:38] Thursday.
[1:03:40] Okay, it is right. All right, so uh
[1:03:42] Isaiah River Hodgeges has a birthday. I
[1:03:45] think he would be about
[1:03:47] one and couldn't get any cuter and his
[1:03:51] birthday's coming up on Thursday. So be
[1:03:53] sure to if you'll just speak to him,
[1:03:55] you'll get his sunny side. Usually his
[1:03:58] sunny disposition. Friday is Moses's
[1:04:01] birthday. They're not here again, I
[1:04:03] mentioned. And then Saturday is Sister
[1:04:05] Gabriella's birthday. And I mentioned
[1:04:08] them because they've been a part of the
[1:04:09] ministry for so long and they're
[1:04:12] streaming the service. Sister Gabriella
[1:04:14] has been through some health issues, but
[1:04:16] God is helping her and we're thankful
[1:04:19] for her and for all these years of
[1:04:20] support. We send our love to to not only
[1:04:24] to her, but to others around the world
[1:04:26] who are watching this service today. And
[1:04:28] because I didn't get it wrote down for
[1:04:31] last week, I forgot to mention that
[1:04:33] Isaac May and Gia and little Gwyn,
[1:04:36] beautiful Gwyn, had a birthday on Friday
[1:04:39] and I I didn't get to announce it.
[1:04:41] Sometimes I have it and I just get I
[1:04:44] just get distracted and forget to
[1:04:45] mention it, but I like for everybody to
[1:04:48] know how much we care about them, and we
[1:04:50] do. We appreciate you so much. Um, let's
[1:04:54] go right to the word. It's going to take
[1:04:56] me a little bit today to get there and
[1:04:58] appreciate your help. This will not be
[1:05:01] everybody's cup of tea. I realize that.
[1:05:04] But it is wellstudied, well prepared. Um
[1:05:07] I haven't I haven't been myself for
[1:05:10] about four days now because I have been
[1:05:13] uh captured by the word. His word is
[1:05:16] life to us. It's life to me. I don't
[1:05:20] understand anybody who's not interested
[1:05:22] in the scripture. Amen. Amen. Uh we have
[1:05:26] to have it. It's our foundation. We
[1:05:29] can't throw out the Old Testament
[1:05:31] because without the Old Testament, the
[1:05:33] New Covenant makes no sense. That's
[1:05:36] right. Makes no sense. You got to have
[1:05:38] it all. Brother Brandham, in fact, he
[1:05:40] told us the whole thing, Old Testament
[1:05:42] and New Testament, is the revelation of
[1:05:44] Jesus Christ. Did you know he said that?
[1:05:46] Not just New Testament, but the whole
[1:05:48] book is the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:05:51] And we're thankful for it. It's our
[1:05:53] absolute.
[1:05:55] Nothing else is my absolute but that
[1:05:57] Bible. That's where my absolute is
[1:06:00] because otherwise we're human. We can
[1:06:02] make mistake. We can uh have progressive
[1:06:05] revelation, not see it all at one time,
[1:06:08] grow in our understanding. Someone said
[1:06:11] prophets don't grow in their
[1:06:12] understanding. I hope they do. It's the
[1:06:14] only explanation I have for some things
[1:06:16] that he said.
[1:06:19] I I heard a tape this week where he was
[1:06:22] uh mentioning the blessed third person
[1:06:23] of the Trinity. Well, I'm glad I know
[1:06:27] that there's only one person in the
[1:06:29] Trinity. His name is Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:06:32] Amen. So, we can always make little
[1:06:35] misspeaks and so forth and etc. But we
[1:06:38] are thankful that he told us what to do
[1:06:40] about it. Go right back.
[1:06:43] 1 Corinthians 5:7 is an appropriate
[1:06:48] uh verse for where we are right now
[1:06:51] because as brother R.J. mentioned
[1:06:55] yesterday on the more modern Jewish
[1:06:59] calendar, we don't know exactly where it
[1:07:00] would be on the ancient calendar, but
[1:07:03] very close to now would have been the uh
[1:07:07] 14th of Nissan or Abib. And that was the
[1:07:12] day of preparation for the Passover that
[1:07:16] would have began that evening at
[1:07:17] sundown. And our Lord was crucified on
[1:07:20] that day at the very same moment that
[1:07:24] all of the other lambs were dying just
[1:07:28] over the hill for the sacrifice of the
[1:07:31] Passover. Josephus describes it as tens
[1:07:35] of thousands of sheep died on the very
[1:07:40] same day that Jesus died right across
[1:07:44] the valley of death on the hill. And we
[1:07:48] should mention that because he tells us
[1:07:51] to remember his death. He doesn't tell
[1:07:54] us particularly to celebrate his
[1:07:56] resurrection except when we come
[1:07:58] together. We come together in
[1:08:00] resurrection life. But he tells us to
[1:08:03] remember his death. 1 Corinthians 5:7,
[1:08:07] "Purge out therefore the old leaven that
[1:08:11] ye may be a
[1:08:14] Is anybody a new lump
[1:08:16] as ye are unleavenvened. For even
[1:08:21] Christ,
[1:08:23] Messiah, anointed one." How many of you
[1:08:26] know that Christ is not his last name?
[1:08:30] Christ is a word that means the anointed
[1:08:33] one, the Messiah. For even Christ our
[1:08:38] Passover is
[1:08:41] sacrificed
[1:08:43] for
[1:08:44] us. Therefore, let us keep the
[1:08:47] feast. This is first Corinthians. This
[1:08:50] is New Testament. This is the Apostle
[1:08:53] Paul.
[1:08:55] Therefore, let us keep the feast. Not
[1:08:57] with old leaven, neither with the
[1:08:59] leavenven of malice and wickedness, but
[1:09:02] with the unleavened bread. Oh yes, of
[1:09:07] sincerity and truth. How many of you
[1:09:10] glad that you have tasted the unleavened
[1:09:12] bread of sincerity and truth? Bow your
[1:09:17] head. Let's pray together just a moment.
[1:09:19] Father, we thank you that you have
[1:09:22] brought us to this place and you have
[1:09:26] met us. You not only came with us, but
[1:09:30] you met us as we came. We need you
[1:09:33] today, Lord. We're going to do some
[1:09:36] teaching where we need your help in
[1:09:38] grasping
[1:09:40] uh it, putting it together, grounding it
[1:09:43] in your word because you're the living
[1:09:45] word. Nobody has greater power to tie it
[1:09:49] together than you. Come Holy Ghost and
[1:09:52] help us all. Not only anoint lips of
[1:09:54] clay, but anoint ears of flesh and a
[1:09:57] heart to receive, to understand, not to
[1:10:01] take it in one direction beyond what the
[1:10:03] word says. But stay right in the middle
[1:10:07] of the road, which is the middle of the
[1:10:09] word. And we'll give you the honor and
[1:10:11] the glory and the praise. For it's in
[1:10:14] the name above every name, the name of
[1:10:15] the Lord Jesus Christ, even Yeshua, our
[1:10:18] Messiah. We pray. And the saint said,
[1:10:21] "Amen." You may be seated. You'll have
[1:10:24] to forgive me.
[1:10:26] I'm experiencing a particularly dry
[1:10:29] mouth. So, I'm going to put in
[1:10:33] something. Would you pray it
[1:10:36] stays? Because if it doesn't, it's
[1:10:38] either going to get Jia or Jason.
[1:10:42] I may sound a little like I have an
[1:10:45] impediment here for a few minutes, but I
[1:10:48] need the moisture. So, not something I
[1:10:50] like to do when I'm preaching, but I
[1:10:52] don't want to lick my lips either. Do
[1:10:53] you understand? Yes, sir.
[1:10:56] So Tuesday night we look at some verses
[1:10:59] and I wish we had time to go back over
[1:11:02] them because they should be put here in
[1:11:04] this right reference but I don't have
[1:11:07] time to spend much time with any of them
[1:11:10] because there's some other things that
[1:11:12] we want to look at. But if you would
[1:11:16] permit me, I need you to stay right with
[1:11:18] me today. Uh because teaching is not me,
[1:11:22] but uh that may be more or less the
[1:11:25] delivery because I want to make sure you
[1:11:26] get these verses. I want you to make
[1:11:28] sure that you write them down. Hold on
[1:11:31] to them. Read them again. See if they
[1:11:34] say what I tell you they say. If I read
[1:11:36] them to you, you check it and make sure
[1:11:38] that's really what it says. Uh because
[1:11:41] anybody can misspeak. And I don't want
[1:11:43] to do that today. So make a note of it
[1:11:45] if you will. But let's look at Matthew 5
[1:11:48] verse 17 and 18. Think not that I am
[1:11:52] come to destroy the law or the prophets.
[1:11:55] I am not come to destroy but to what?
[1:11:59] Fulfill. For verily I say unto you, till
[1:12:01] the heaven and earth pass, one jot or
[1:12:04] one tit shall in no wise pass from the
[1:12:08] law.
[1:12:09] Jesus is saying not one letter, neither
[1:12:14] one piece of
[1:12:16] punctuation because in the Hebrew you
[1:12:18] can add a little a little jot or tit and
[1:12:23] change the way the letter
[1:12:26] sounds. It would be like us saying not
[1:12:29] one comma or one period is going to pass
[1:12:33] away. However, you do understand that in
[1:12:36] English grammar, some of these things
[1:12:38] are
[1:12:39] discretionary and a comma in the wrong
[1:12:42] place may look right to you, but in
[1:12:45] reading it, if you follow the prompt of
[1:12:48] the comma, you can really get things out
[1:12:50] of order. Correct? So when we're
[1:12:53] examining the English Bible, we're not
[1:12:56] always checking exactly the comma or the
[1:12:59] colon or semicolon because those things
[1:13:03] are added by
[1:13:05] translators to help us to read and to
[1:13:08] understand.
[1:13:09] Even in your beloved King James version
[1:13:12] Bible, you will find that there are
[1:13:15] words such as articles that are added to
[1:13:18] the actual Hebrew or Greek words. And
[1:13:22] therefore, every word you read in
[1:13:24] English does not have a Hebrew or a
[1:13:27] Greek equivalent. And sometimes they are
[1:13:30] added just to help you be able to read
[1:13:34] what the translators have have written.
[1:13:38] uh it doesn't mean that anyone has added
[1:13:40] to the word. It just simply means if you
[1:13:43] take out the ands and the butts, uh you
[1:13:48] take out prepositions and some other
[1:13:50] parts of speech, you you you don't have
[1:13:53] something that makes nearly as much
[1:13:55] sense. You have to work at it. I don't
[1:13:58] know if any of you have ever read uh the
[1:14:00] the YT or the Young Liv uh literal,
[1:14:04] excuse me, Young's literal translation.
[1:14:07] There are several literal translations
[1:14:09] of the Bible. And in those translations,
[1:14:12] it's just a Greek word has been
[1:14:14] translated or just a Hebrew word
[1:14:16] translated. So there are no little
[1:14:19] articles or words added to help it to
[1:14:21] make sense. So, it would be hard to make
[1:14:25] that your everyday reading Bible, but
[1:14:28] sometimes, Jonathan, it's interesting to
[1:14:30] look at it because it shows you how much
[1:14:32] has had to be added for you and I to be
[1:14:36] able to understand it. And uh so I like
[1:14:39] to do what Brother Brandham said. He he
[1:14:42] liked to go back to look. He wasn't a
[1:14:44] scholar. Neither am I. But he liked to
[1:14:47] go back and look and see sometimes what
[1:14:49] the words mean.
[1:14:51] You can really get a lot out of it. You
[1:14:54] will find, as I have mentioned to you
[1:14:56] through the years, that there are words,
[1:14:58] English words in the King James version
[1:15:00] of the Bible that no longer mean today
[1:15:04] what they meant in 1611.
[1:15:07] And so you read it, it's still God's
[1:15:09] sacred word. It's still holy. It's not
[1:15:13] tampered with, but it could cause you to
[1:15:16] take away a slightly different meaning.
[1:15:19] Now, I'm not proposing to you that the
[1:15:22] word gay is in the Bible. But what if
[1:15:24] the word gay was there? One generation
[1:15:27] ago, that word meant uh
[1:15:31] carefree, happy, cheery. Today, if you
[1:15:35] were to say, "Wow, you're having a
[1:15:37] mighty
[1:15:38] day." You might get a punch right in the
[1:15:41] nose.
[1:15:43] So words can change their meanings and
[1:15:46] applications as they go along through
[1:15:48] the ages. And remember that the king,
[1:15:52] King James, was very determined to
[1:15:55] remain king as long as he lived. And so
[1:15:58] he had the translators to operate with a
[1:16:01] heavy hand in verses that spoke about
[1:16:06] authority. This is a well-known fact. He
[1:16:09] liked those verses and he would uh make
[1:16:12] sure that they used language that would
[1:16:16] be easily understood in 1611 that
[1:16:20] everyone was subject to authority and if
[1:16:24] possible he would have probably said
[1:16:25] king's authority but he didn't quite
[1:16:27] have them to go that far. There are many
[1:16:30] examples that are given. So it's not to
[1:16:33] say that we can't get everything we need
[1:16:35] out of it. We can, but we need the Holy
[1:16:38] Spirit. Brother Brandham used a good
[1:16:41] dictionary. That wouldn't hurt anybody,
[1:16:43] would it? And uh he also used uh what we
[1:16:48] would call a lexicon, but it's a limited
[1:16:51] one that is today primarily used by 7th
[1:16:56] Day Adventist and Mormons. But there's
[1:16:57] no problem particularly with that. But
[1:17:00] there are there are books and online
[1:17:02] sources that will help you if you ever
[1:17:05] want to look at something deep. And if
[1:17:07] you don't, then the Holy Ghost will
[1:17:09] certainly help you. I'm not in any way
[1:17:11] believing that resources replace the
[1:17:15] Holy Ghost. Nothing nothing can can
[1:17:18] interpret or give you understanding of
[1:17:20] the word like the good Holy Ghost.
[1:17:23] Aren't you glad he lives in you? Yes. So
[1:17:26] Jesus said, "Think not that I am come to
[1:17:28] destroy the law or the prophets. I am
[1:17:31] not come to destroy but to fulfill. For
[1:17:34] verily I say unto you, till heaven and
[1:17:36] earth pass, one jot or one till shall in
[1:17:38] no wise pass from the law till all be
[1:17:42] fulfilled." Now we know as we look at
[1:17:45] the Old Testament, we know that many of
[1:17:48] the feasts of the Lord, they're the
[1:17:50] feast of Yave, the feast of in English
[1:17:53] we would say Jehovah. They're not Jewish
[1:17:55] feasts. They belong to the Lord. They
[1:17:58] pre-exist the Jewish nation. You do
[1:18:02] understand that the feast of the Lord
[1:18:04] existed before the Jews were a people.
[1:18:08] Isn't that interesting? And they're
[1:18:10] never called in scripture the feast of
[1:18:12] the Hebrews or the feast of the Jews.
[1:18:14] They're always referred to as Adonai's
[1:18:16] feast or as we sang this morning,
[1:18:19] Adonai, which means Lord, the Lord's
[1:18:22] feast. They belong to him. And you and I
[1:18:24] know that many of those feasts have
[1:18:26] already been 100% filled to the brim.
[1:18:30] That is the spring feast. And a portion
[1:18:34] of the fall feast have also been already
[1:18:37] filled up to the very top. But there are
[1:18:40] some portions of the fall feast that
[1:18:43] even brother Brandham told us had not
[1:18:45] yet come into full fruition because some
[1:18:47] of them speak of millennium and we are
[1:18:50] not yet in the millennium. I have a few
[1:18:52] friends that believe that they're
[1:18:54] already living in the millennium, but
[1:18:56] they still bleed. And that's that's
[1:18:59] nearly impossible. If you have some sort
[1:19:02] of a new body, I don't think your new
[1:19:04] body, your glorified body, your
[1:19:06] theophony body, your spiritual body is
[1:19:08] going to bleed. Do you? So, we are
[1:19:11] seated together in heavenly places. No
[1:19:13] doubt about that. The word destroy there
[1:19:16] means to
[1:19:17] demolish. It means to utterly do away
[1:19:20] with, to dissolve, to come to not, to
[1:19:23] overthrow, to throw down. Jesus said,
[1:19:26] "Don't you think that I have come to
[1:19:28] throw down what's already been written
[1:19:30] or to dissolve what's already been
[1:19:32] written? I'm glad for that." Uh, so then
[1:19:35] we went to Romans, and we won't do that
[1:19:38] now, but just jot it down for your
[1:19:40] study. Romans 15:4. And then we would go
[1:19:43] to Ephesians 2 11-13.
[1:19:47] Now, I'd like for us to go I wish we
[1:19:49] could read all of those this morning,
[1:19:51] but I'd like for us to go to Romans 11
[1:19:53] for just a moment. Uh, beginning in
[1:19:55] verse 16 through verse 18. For if the
[1:19:59] first handful of dough, this is in the
[1:20:02] amplified. I have it in the King James
[1:20:04] if you need it, but let's just stay with
[1:20:05] the Amplified. If that offends anybody,
[1:20:08] just you hold your your King James and
[1:20:10] read it. Now if the first handful of
[1:20:12] dough offered as the first fruits,
[1:20:15] Abraham and the patriarchs is
[1:20:17] consecrated holy, so is the whole mass,
[1:20:20] the whole nation. But if some of the
[1:20:23] branches were broken off, while you, a
[1:20:25] wild olive chute, were grafted in among
[1:20:29] them, who do you think that wild olive
[1:20:32] shoot is?
[1:20:34] nations, Gentiles, goim, if you will,
[1:20:40] non-Jews, you are you are grafted in
[1:20:44] because some of the original branches
[1:20:46] were broken off. And that made room. I
[1:20:50] like that. That made room for you and I
[1:20:53] as nations, as Gentiles, to be grafted
[1:20:56] into the same
[1:20:57] rootstock. You want to be grafted into
[1:21:00] the same rootstock. That rootstock is is
[1:21:03] the is the heritage of David. You want
[1:21:06] to go back to that. You want to make
[1:21:08] sure you're connected because David's
[1:21:10] throne is the only eternal throne
[1:21:12] according to the scripture. And that's
[1:21:14] the one our Messiah sits on. He came as
[1:21:17] son of David. He came to fulfill those
[1:21:21] scriptures. It's beautiful. It actually
[1:21:23] is very beautiful. Uh uh but I think we
[1:21:26] should go to King James if you will. For
[1:21:29] if the first fruit be holy, the lump is
[1:21:32] also holy. And if the root be holy, so
[1:21:35] are the branches. Are you with me? And
[1:21:38] if some of the branches were broken off,
[1:21:40] and thou being a wild olive tree were
[1:21:43] wer grafted among them, and with them
[1:21:46] and with them partakers of the root and
[1:21:50] fatness of the olive tree. Hallelujah.
[1:21:54] You might not have been a cultivated
[1:21:56] olive branch. You might have been a wild
[1:21:59] olive branch, but did you know that a
[1:22:02] wild olive branch can be grafted into a
[1:22:04] cultivated olive tree and produce ripe
[1:22:08] fruit? That's what that's what Paul's
[1:22:10] telling us. And and it's kind of
[1:22:12] beautiful because we draw both life from
[1:22:16] the root and fatness, oil from the
[1:22:19] original olive tree. And I love that.
[1:22:22] And there's so much more that I would
[1:22:24] like to talk about, but we don't have
[1:22:26] time. Let's land quickly at Colossians
[1:22:29] chapter 2 for just a moment. 16-1 17 uh
[1:22:34] King James. Let no man therefore judge
[1:22:37] you in meat or in drink or in respect of
[1:22:43] an holy day or of the new moon or of the
[1:22:47] Sabbath days. Now let me help you
[1:22:50] understand that means that I am not to
[1:22:53] judge you if you have no respect for
[1:22:56] those things. You are not my servant.
[1:23:00] You are a servant of the Lord. But it
[1:23:02] also means that you are not to judge me.
[1:23:06] If I decide that I would like to uh keep
[1:23:09] a kosher lifestyle, not eat pork or
[1:23:13] lobster or shrimp, you shouldn't judge
[1:23:15] me for that. If I decided that I
[1:23:18] wouldn't drink uh hard liquor or wine or
[1:23:21] things like that, well, you shouldn't
[1:23:23] judge me. In fact, if I should show
[1:23:26] respect to some holy day as long as it
[1:23:29] is a biblical holy day. You you you
[1:23:32] can't go out and take a satinella. You
[1:23:35] can't go out and take uh something that
[1:23:37] is dedicated to the goddess Ashtarth or
[1:23:40] Asteroth or Estore. You can't take
[1:23:43] something that was never a part of God
[1:23:45] and celebrate that and call it holy. The
[1:23:48] Bible tells us you can't call what God
[1:23:50] has cursed holy. Well, if it's common,
[1:23:53] it's common. If God's blessed it, you
[1:23:56] can't call it unclean.
[1:23:58] And so, he doesn't bless that that
[1:24:00] doesn't belong to him. If somebody were
[1:24:02] to say, uh, we know now we're in a new
[1:24:05] month because the moon is new. The the
[1:24:07] Apostle Paul said, ' Don't judge
[1:24:09] somebody for watching for noticing the
[1:24:11] the the new
[1:24:12] moon. Don't don't judge someone who
[1:24:15] doesn't watch the new moon. We don't
[1:24:17] live by a lunar calendar anymore. We
[1:24:20] live by a solar calendar. We live by
[1:24:23] Catholic calendar. It was created and
[1:24:26] sanctioned by uh Pope Gregory. And
[1:24:29] that's why we call it the Gregorian
[1:24:31] calendar. That's what we live by. The
[1:24:34] names of the days of the week are pagan
[1:24:36] names. their names of other gods. And
[1:24:39] yet, how else would we conduct business?
[1:24:41] Wouldn't we get confused? It would be
[1:24:43] like running on central and eastern time
[1:24:45] trying to decide which it is. And so,
[1:24:48] yes, of course, we say Monday, uh, the
[1:24:50] day of the I'd rather not call it
[1:24:52] Monday. But if I came up with a biblical
[1:24:55] name or some name less pagan, many
[1:24:58] people wouldn't know what I was talking
[1:24:59] about. So, don't judge me if I call it
[1:25:02] Wednesday or Thursday. I wouldn't judge
[1:25:04] you if you decided not to call it by any
[1:25:07] of those pagan names. Do you understand?
[1:25:09] These are not things that we are
[1:25:11] supposed to determine for somebody else.
[1:25:14] Is that okay? I think it's good to look
[1:25:17] at it that way. These things these
[1:25:20] things different differentiation in
[1:25:22] meat, differentiation in drink, respect
[1:25:24] of the holy day, new moons are of the
[1:25:28] Sabbath days. There are 52 weekly
[1:25:30] Sabbaths in the year, one every Friday
[1:25:34] night at sundown. And there are seven
[1:25:36] other holy uh Sabbaths, high Sabbaths or
[1:25:41] festival Sabbaths that take place from
[1:25:44] scripture during some of the feast of
[1:25:46] the Lord. And you're familiar with that.
[1:25:49] Evidently,
[1:25:50] uh the church has not always been
[1:25:54] extremely familiar with that idea. And
[1:25:57] so they're reading to try to determine
[1:25:59] the day that Jesus resurrected from the
[1:26:02] grave. And they saw that he must be
[1:26:05] taken down off of the cross before the
[1:26:09] day of preparation, meaning the day
[1:26:11] before the Sabbath. And so the church
[1:26:14] decided in 3:25 AD at the Nyine Council,
[1:26:18] the same council that created the
[1:26:20] Trinity Doctrine, they decided that the
[1:26:22] resurrection would always be celebrated
[1:26:25] on a Sunday. Up until 3:25 AD, the the
[1:26:29] original church did not celebrate the
[1:26:32] resurrection. They celebrated the
[1:26:34] crucifixion and they did it on the feast
[1:26:37] of Passover. In fact, you can thank
[1:26:40] somebody like Polycarp. You know the
[1:26:43] name, don't you? He was the mentor, the
[1:26:45] teacher of Iranius. And Polycarp is one
[1:26:48] of the ones who stood up and said, "It's
[1:26:50] not right. It's not right what you're
[1:26:53] doing to change the days of the feast to
[1:26:56] make it more appeasing to the heathen,
[1:26:59] to the pagan. What you're doing is not
[1:27:01] right. And may God deal with you and
[1:27:03] judge you for it. Nonetheless, in 3:25
[1:27:07] AD, the church looked at it and they
[1:27:09] said, "Well, the Bible does say the body
[1:27:11] had to come down off the cross before
[1:27:13] the Sabbath began, this being the day of
[1:27:16] preparation." And therefore they decided
[1:27:18] that he was crucified on
[1:27:21] Friday, rose from the dead on Sunday and
[1:27:24] called it Good Friday. For over 300
[1:27:28] years, no one observed anything about a
[1:27:32] Friday, right? But the church decided
[1:27:36] and they decided also then that that
[1:27:38] would set the course of Passion Week.
[1:27:41] And so now for a long time over let's
[1:27:45] say at least 1,400 plus years the church
[1:27:48] has looked at it without exception
[1:27:51] traditionally exactly like it was
[1:27:54] determined at the nyine council in 3:25.
[1:27:57] Why does that even matter? We have the
[1:27:59] message. Why why would any of that
[1:28:01] matter? Because I hear brother Brandham
[1:28:03] saying over and over again all the way
[1:28:05] up to 1965. I've come to help turn you
[1:28:09] away. Yes, sir. from paganism
[1:28:12] back to the word. I'm interested in
[1:28:15] going back to the word in every shape,
[1:28:18] form, or fashion. If it bankrupts hell
[1:28:21] or hair lips the devil, I'm interested
[1:28:24] in going back to the word. And I believe
[1:28:27] that you are. I really do. These are not
[1:28:30] things we should judge one another in.
[1:28:33] We shouldn't have great debates and
[1:28:35] arguments and get mad at people and
[1:28:37] stomp our feet and post on social media.
[1:28:40] It is what it is. I'm not going to judge
[1:28:43] you for doing it your way. You shouldn't
[1:28:45] judge me for doing it my way as long as
[1:28:48] you can't prove that my way is the Bible
[1:28:51] way. And you can't prove otherwise. And
[1:28:54] I'll show you this uh in in just a
[1:28:57] matter of time. These are Look at verse
[1:28:59] 17. Here's the key. Go back. Go back,
[1:29:02] Charity. I'm getting ahead of myself. I
[1:29:05] don't have many notes. Only 102 pages
[1:29:07] this morning. We'll never get to them
[1:29:08] all, will
[1:29:11] we? I'm not exaggerating. Actually, it's
[1:29:13] 103. But moving right along. Uh he said,
[1:29:17] "Now, not in meat or drink, not in
[1:29:19] respect of a holy day or of a new moon
[1:29:21] or of a Sabbath day." Look, there's
[1:29:23] nothing wrong with any of these things.
[1:29:25] God mentions them all in the Old
[1:29:27] Testament. I didn't come to destroy
[1:29:29] these things. I came to show you what
[1:29:31] they mean. That's what fulfill means.
[1:29:33] Fill them up. Complete them. Hallelujah.
[1:29:37] and and and let them point to me.
[1:29:41] Amen. Uh I I once witnessed the message
[1:29:44] of someone who told me after listening
[1:29:45] to a few tapes, I don't enjoy Brother
[1:29:47] Brandham's preaching because he stays so
[1:29:50] much in the Old
[1:29:51] Testament. Isn't that interesting that
[1:29:53] people would look from the outside in
[1:29:55] and find he said I have to do that
[1:29:58] because he said I'm not a scholar. I'm a
[1:30:01] typologist. He called himself. That's a
[1:30:03] big word. Somebody told him what it
[1:30:05] meant. a typologist. I'm one who can
[1:30:08] only understand the word by looking at
[1:30:11] the types. That's what he said. And then
[1:30:14] when I look at the types, I see how
[1:30:17] everything dove tales together. Sounds
[1:30:19] like the working of the Holy Spirit to
[1:30:21] me. It sounds like it was a good way to
[1:30:24] interpret things. And it's only when we
[1:30:26] lean back on our tradition or or when we
[1:30:29] go back to what we have thought in times
[1:30:31] past that we can say things that no
[1:30:33] longer dovetail with the word. And I can
[1:30:37] assure you this morning without trying
[1:30:38] to offend anyone watching this service
[1:30:40] or anyone here. I can assure you the
[1:30:43] Bible does not support in any shape, any
[1:30:46] form or any fashion a Good Friday
[1:30:48] crucifixion. It simply did not happen.
[1:30:52] And if it did, then Jesus did not speak
[1:30:55] the truth. And I don't believe only that
[1:30:58] he spoke the truth. I believe he was the
[1:31:02] truth. He said, "I am the way. I am the
[1:31:06] truth. I am the life." Somebody said,
[1:31:09] "Why does it matter?" It matters because
[1:31:12] if Jesus is fulfilling the feast, not
[1:31:15] destroying them, but filling them up. If
[1:31:17] he's filling them up, that means he has
[1:31:19] to fulfill them.
[1:31:21] That means that if anything happens in
[1:31:23] his birth or in his death or in his
[1:31:26] ministry that doesn't line up with what
[1:31:29] the pattern that God has given us in the
[1:31:31] feast of the Lord, then something is a
[1:31:35] muck. Something is it's wrong. Amen. I
[1:31:40] don't want to cheat and get too far
[1:31:42] ahead of myself, but I want to now look
[1:31:44] at verse 17.
[1:31:46] These are if we are in King James which
[1:31:49] are a shadow. I want somebody to say
[1:31:52] shadow. Shadow. A shadow of things to
[1:31:55] come. But the
[1:31:57] body is of Christ. Don't judge people in
[1:32:01] meat or drink or holy days or new moons.
[1:32:04] Don't do that. These are shadows of
[1:32:07] things to come. And when the real comes,
[1:32:11] when the real image comes instead of the
[1:32:13] shadow, you will understand more
[1:32:16] completely and perfectly the shadow. And
[1:32:19] then you will see how that God is
[1:32:22] perfect.
[1:32:23] I want to present to you again a God who
[1:32:26] is perfect in all of his ways. A God who
[1:32:28] never makes a mistake. A God who never
[1:32:31] changes his mind about anything
[1:32:33] concerning his word. A God who is
[1:32:36] faithful and true. A God who doesn't
[1:32:39] care what churches say or preachers say,
[1:32:42] he's only jealous over his word.
[1:32:45] His word. I I want to be jealous over
[1:32:48] his word. These are shadows. If you were
[1:32:50] to look at verse 17 in in the complete
[1:32:53] Jewish Bible, it said, "These are a
[1:32:54] shadow of things that are coming, but
[1:32:58] the body is of the Messiah." And the
[1:33:00] amplified says about verse 7 uh uh verse
[1:33:04] 17, excuse me, such things are only the
[1:33:07] shadow of things that are to come. And
[1:33:09] they have only a symbolic value, but the
[1:33:12] reality, the substance, the solid fact
[1:33:15] of what is foreshadowed, the body of
[1:33:21] it belongs to Christ. Did you know,
[1:33:24] brother said, if you can't find Christ
[1:33:26] all through the scripture, something's
[1:33:28] wrong. you're not looking hard enough.
[1:33:30] He's there. He called the Old Testament
[1:33:33] part of the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:33:37] How could he do that? Because it's full
[1:33:39] of shadows and types and then antitypes
[1:33:44] and then literal images. I'm so thankful
[1:33:48] that we're not spinning around trying to
[1:33:51] only live in the shadows.
[1:33:55] If all you knew was keeping a Passover
[1:33:57] seder, you wouldn't know the whole book,
[1:34:01] the whole word. If you only knew that
[1:34:04] Saturday was the Sabbath, but you didn't
[1:34:06] understand that Jesus proved himself as
[1:34:10] being Lord over the Sabbath, then you
[1:34:13] wouldn't understand the whole book. How
[1:34:16] many of you want to get it all? I do.
[1:34:18] And that's why I'm on this subject this
[1:34:20] morning. And I know that again, it's not
[1:34:23] everybody's uh interest, but oh my, it's
[1:34:27] mine. I can't help myself. It's mine.
[1:34:32] Hebrews 10:1, for the law having a
[1:34:35] shadow of good things to come, and not
[1:34:38] the very image of the things, can never
[1:34:41] with those sacrifices which they offered
[1:34:44] year by year, continually make the
[1:34:46] comers there unto perfect. It doesn't
[1:34:49] matter how many times a temple is
[1:34:50] rebuilt. It doesn't matter how many
[1:34:52] times we return to animal sacrifice. It
[1:34:55] doesn't matter how many years animal
[1:34:57] offerings were in place. None of those
[1:35:00] animals could atone for the sins of
[1:35:03] mankind. They were only a symbol of an
[1:35:06] offering given to God so that God would
[1:35:09] appease be appeased is what many people
[1:35:12] uh seem to look at it. But it's really
[1:35:14] saying, "God, I thank you that you've
[1:35:15] given me a way to put things uh away. I
[1:35:20] I I thank you that you've given me a way
[1:35:22] to separate myself from my own behavior,
[1:35:25] from my own actions." But the blood of
[1:35:28] an animal only covered the surface of
[1:35:30] the sin. It never addressed the issue
[1:35:34] and it never brought full redemption or
[1:35:36] atonement. How many of you glad that the
[1:35:39] blood that Jesus shed for us was God's
[1:35:42] blood created specifically for the
[1:35:44] purpose of redemption? And it didn't
[1:35:46] just cover sin. What did it do? It
[1:35:48] remitted it. It brought us to what?
[1:35:52] Justification. And justification is
[1:35:55] boiling it down. Just if I'd never
[1:35:58] sinned. Brother Brandham said, "You
[1:35:59] never did it.
[1:36:02] You never did it in the first place. It
[1:36:06] has been totally annihilated from the
[1:36:09] mind of God.
[1:36:11] Not just covered,
[1:36:13] undone, dissolved.
[1:36:16] Praise God. It does not exist.
[1:36:22] Now, if you're sitting in this service
[1:36:24] this morning and you're more worried
[1:36:26] about how people on the outside are
[1:36:29] going to be stirred about what I'm
[1:36:31] saying, you're going to miss what I'm
[1:36:33] saying.
[1:36:35] So for just a few minutes, would you
[1:36:37] forget your friends and family
[1:36:41] who might not agree with this kind of
[1:36:44] message? Can you just forget them for
[1:36:45] just a few minutes? Don't forsake them,
[1:36:47] but just for a few minutes, can you just
[1:36:50] not care what other churches are going
[1:36:52] to and all our secret streamers how
[1:36:54] they're going to process this? Folks, if
[1:36:56] I told you it doesn't matter to me, I
[1:36:58] would be telling you 100% true. If it's
[1:37:01] on the word,
[1:37:04] I don't care what they think. I don't
[1:37:07] care what they say.
[1:37:09] It's not my job to prop up anything
[1:37:11] that's not on the word.
[1:37:14] He said back to the word, back to the
[1:37:17] absolute, back to thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:37:21] I read this morning he said if it
[1:37:23] doesn't dovetail with the word one
[1:37:25] scripture uh leaving off another
[1:37:27] scripture taking up he said then you
[1:37:30] can't you can't build your
[1:37:32] life on something like that. So don't
[1:37:36] worry don't even sit here. I know
[1:37:37] sometimes even my kids they're thinking
[1:37:39] that some young people from another
[1:37:41] church somewhere they're going to really
[1:37:43] be upset and they're going to be so
[1:37:44] stirred about what I say. Let them
[1:37:46] folks. It doesn't matter. It doesn't
[1:37:49] matter. I only am here to do what God
[1:37:52] has called me to do for this house. If
[1:37:55] we can bless somebody out there, okay,
[1:37:58] if we stir somebody out there and makes
[1:38:00] them go and study more, and if they
[1:38:02] don't just look at quotes, but if
[1:38:04] they'll look at the Bible,
[1:38:07] if they won't just use the church age
[1:38:08] book, but they'll use the sermons.
[1:38:12] Amen. They might not find too much to
[1:38:15] kick against.
[1:38:17] Are you mad this morning? Not at all.
[1:38:19] I'm not mad at all. You can ask my
[1:38:22] family. I'm not mad. This they they will
[1:38:24] tell you the hours, the amount of time
[1:38:27] that I've spent over these last few
[1:38:29] days. I want to understand it. I want
[1:38:32] scripture to dovetail what he said. I
[1:38:34] want scripture to lock hands with
[1:38:36] scripture.
[1:38:38] If it has no foundation, I don't know
[1:38:40] whether or not I can believe it, much
[1:38:42] less preach it if it has no foundation
[1:38:46] in the word.
[1:38:48] Now he goes on but all these sacrifices
[1:38:51] in the amplified the second part said it
[1:38:53] can never by offering the same
[1:38:55] sacrifices continually year after year
[1:38:58] make perfect those who approach its
[1:38:59] altars. Now that word shadow that
[1:39:02] appears in Hebrews 10:1 and Colossians 2
[1:39:05] is the word
[1:39:07] skia skia and it means a shadow shade or
[1:39:11] darkened silhouette cast by an object
[1:39:14] caused by interception of light. It
[1:39:17] means a
[1:39:18] foreshadowing. It means a vague outline.
[1:39:22] It appears as translated as shadow seven
[1:39:25] times in the New Testament. It's an
[1:39:28] interesting word and I I would like to
[1:39:33] talk for an extended time about it, but
[1:39:37] I don't have time to do that. But there
[1:39:40] is something that I would like to
[1:39:43] contrast it with. If you'll give me just
[1:39:45] a moment. There's another word that
[1:39:48] appears there
[1:39:51] uh
[1:39:52] in Hebrews 10:1. It says for the law
[1:39:56] having a
[1:39:58] shadowke of good things to come and not
[1:40:01] the very image which is the Greek word
[1:40:05] econ. That word eon is very image. It
[1:40:10] means very image. It means the likeness.
[1:40:14] It means a profile. It means a
[1:40:17] representation, a resemblance, an image.
[1:40:20] It's much more of a concrete word than
[1:40:23] shadow. It takes an image to cast a
[1:40:27] shadow. It takes an image in the
[1:40:31] light to cast a shadow. So, the shadow
[1:40:35] is similar to the image, but it's not
[1:40:38] something that would give you as full or
[1:40:41] as complete of a picture. It's only a
[1:40:45] silhouette or an outline. It's a shadow.
[1:40:48] Do you understand? But there has to be
[1:40:50] an image. And there has to be an image
[1:40:53] in the presence of light to be able to
[1:40:56] cast a shadow. That makes that verse
[1:40:59] live. For we have a shadow. We have
[1:41:04] something that has been cast by an image
[1:41:08] in the light of good things to come.
[1:41:11] We don't live forever embracing the
[1:41:13] shadow. We don't Jesus said, "I didn't
[1:41:16] destroy it. I filled it up." For
[1:41:20] teaching purposes, we mention it for
[1:41:23] celebratory purposes. We remember it.
[1:41:26] But the reality is, who in this world
[1:41:29] would want to hang to the shadow when
[1:41:31] you can hang to the image that produced
[1:41:34] the shadow?
[1:41:37] It's Jesus Christ. the same
[1:41:41] yesterday, today, and forever. But if
[1:41:44] there's something that we could use,
[1:41:46] study, pray about that would help us to
[1:41:50] understand the image more, then what
[1:41:52] would that be? It would be what the
[1:41:54] scripture calls shadows,
[1:41:57] types, symbols. Brother Brandham said,
[1:42:00] they've made interpreting the book of
[1:42:01] the Revelation so hard because they
[1:42:03] don't understand it's a book of symbols.
[1:42:06] And once you understand what the symbols
[1:42:08] are, then you can understand what the
[1:42:11] book means. Once you understand what the
[1:42:14] feast are, you can understand how Jesus
[1:42:17] fulfilled them. You see, there are many
[1:42:19] people uh in the world and around this
[1:42:22] message who are very satisfied for the
[1:42:24] preacher to say Jesus Christ fulfilled
[1:42:26] the
[1:42:28] Passover. And they amen and they have
[1:42:31] their quotes to support it and they move
[1:42:33] on to something else. I'm not that
[1:42:36] person. I believe he did. I believe he
[1:42:39] did because the Bible said so. Started
[1:42:41] reading it. That's how we started. I
[1:42:43] believe it because brother Brandham
[1:42:45] brought it out from the scripture. But
[1:42:48] I'd like to
[1:42:49] know what did the Passover mean? And how
[1:42:54] is it that Jesus fulfilled it? Well, I'm
[1:42:59] not going to spend the rest of my life
[1:43:00] studying Easter because I know that
[1:43:02] Jesus had nothing to do and never has
[1:43:05] had anything and never will have
[1:43:07] anything to do with Easter.
[1:43:10] So why would I spend my life embracing,
[1:43:12] studying, researching Easter? But when I
[1:43:16] find that there is something that points
[1:43:18] me and that I might possibly have the
[1:43:21] opportunity to understand more about the
[1:43:24] image by looking at the shadow,
[1:43:27] especially when the shadow is in the
[1:43:29] word. If the shadow was in a novel,
[1:43:32] that's something else of an entirely
[1:43:34] different nature. But if both the shadow
[1:43:36] and the image is presented in the word,
[1:43:38] I love to watch the Holy Spirit tie
[1:43:42] together. The shadow and the reality,
[1:43:45] the shadow and the image. I can't help
[1:43:49] the way I'm made. It makes me want to
[1:43:51] jump over the pull pit sometime when
[1:43:53] when it hits me how he meticulously
[1:43:57] [Music]
[1:43:58] if if I were to preach about the colors
[1:44:00] of the tabernacle, which I have, even
[1:44:03] the colors of the thread preached the
[1:44:06] gospel. Who would have ever thought that
[1:44:08] the colors of thread chosen to weave the
[1:44:12] veil would have preached a message, a
[1:44:14] gospel of Jesus Christ? But it does. So,
[1:44:17] I could get up here and say, "Even the
[1:44:19] veil of the temple and tabernacle
[1:44:21] preached the gospel of Jesus." And many
[1:44:23] would just say, "Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:44:25] That's good enough for me." And go on.
[1:44:27] But there's always going to be somebody
[1:44:28] sitting here that says,
[1:44:30] "How." It It's not a sin to say how.
[1:44:34] It's not a sin to want to know how, but
[1:44:37] it requires some taking time to look at
[1:44:40] it a little more closely. For those of
[1:44:43] you who are satisfied with a two and a
[1:44:45] half hour sermon on Sunday and an hour
[1:44:47] and a half sermon on Tuesday night, you
[1:44:49] won't find this interest. But if you're
[1:44:52] somebody who has fallen in love with the
[1:44:53] word because you know it's a written
[1:44:55] record of a person that you have fallen
[1:44:57] in love with. It's his love story. When
[1:45:01] you realize that it's the greatest love
[1:45:03] novel, love history that's ever been
[1:45:05] written, love story, love letter that's
[1:45:07] ever been written in the history of
[1:45:09] mankind. And you'll know more about your
[1:45:12] bridegroom lover if you study, if you
[1:45:15] read the letter that he has left us.
[1:45:18] It'll make you want to look a little
[1:45:19] deeper. Nothing wrong with digging a
[1:45:21] little deeper. Somebody say, "Amen." I
[1:45:24] wouldn't be satisfied with just the with
[1:45:26] just the image. I want to understand the
[1:45:28] shadow, but I wouldn't be satisfied to
[1:45:30] just stay with the shadow when I know
[1:45:32] the image has arrived. He arrived. He
[1:45:34] came. He fulfilled the word. Hallelujah.
[1:45:38] Oh my. Skip page six, five, six, skip
[1:45:40] page seven, skip page eight. A shadow
[1:45:44] only exists where there is light. Got to
[1:45:46] have light. Christ is the light that
[1:45:49] cast the shadow of the law. And Christ
[1:45:53] is the reality and the fulfillment and
[1:45:55] the image.
[1:45:57] of what was cast by the shadow. So he is
[1:46:00] both the image and the light. Aren't you
[1:46:01] glad? Both the image and the light. In
[1:46:04] fact, the Bible said in him there is
[1:46:05] light and in him there is no
[1:46:08] darkness. No darkness at all. He is
[1:46:12] light. Hallelujah. The apostles
[1:46:15] reverenced and honored these patterns in
[1:46:17] Acts 18:21. But bade them farewell. This
[1:46:20] is the Apostle Paul, the first church
[1:46:22] age messenger. He bade them farewell,
[1:46:25] saying, I must by all means keep the
[1:46:28] feast that cometh in Jerusalem. But I
[1:46:30] will return again unto you if God will.
[1:46:33] And he sailed from Ephesus. This was
[1:46:35] after the crucifixion. This was after
[1:46:37] the resurrection. This was after the
[1:46:39] Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost.
[1:46:41] And what do you hear Paul saying? I'd
[1:46:43] like to stay here with you longer, but I
[1:46:46] have to be back in
[1:46:47] Jerusalem at feast
[1:46:49] time. How in the world could he do such
[1:46:52] a thing? He met the image. He met the
[1:46:54] fulfillment. He met me the reality. He
[1:46:56] understood who Jesus was. Yes. But he
[1:46:58] respected every shadow. He respected
[1:47:01] every sign. He respected every finger
[1:47:04] that pointed him to Christ.
[1:47:07] Amen. And look what God had to do to get
[1:47:10] him. He had decided to make a hobby out
[1:47:13] of persecuting and murdering the early
[1:47:16] church. He was on his way with orders to
[1:47:19] kill more of the church on his hip when
[1:47:21] God said, "I'm going to interrupt him."
[1:47:23] And he met him on the road to Damascus.
[1:47:26] Who art thou, Lord?
[1:47:30] Who art thou, Lord? Isn't that what he
[1:47:33] said when God knocked him off his high
[1:47:35] horse? Who art thou, Lord? And guess
[1:47:38] what he said? He didn't say, I'm the
[1:47:40] Passover lamb.
[1:47:42] He said, I am Jesus. I am Yeshua. who
[1:47:46] you have persecuted. That's right. It is
[1:47:50] hard for thee to kick against the
[1:47:53] pricks. But I'm about to do something in
[1:47:55] your life. Saul Shaul was about to have
[1:47:59] a name change. But bigger than that, he
[1:48:02] was about to have a nature change. And
[1:48:04] because he was a Pharisee of Pharisees,
[1:48:06] no one knew the law any better than he
[1:48:08] did. So he was an expert on the shadow.
[1:48:11] He was an expert on the sign. He was an
[1:48:14] expert on everything that pointed him to
[1:48:16] Christ. And God was about to make him an
[1:48:19] expert on who Jesus was.
[1:48:23] And he cared enough that he met him
[1:48:26] right where he was. Blinded him, though.
[1:48:30] Blinded him. Because the reality is
[1:48:32] this, sister. You'll see him better when
[1:48:36] you become blinded to your religious
[1:48:38] nature. Yes. Religion is what keeps
[1:48:42] people from digging a little deeper.
[1:48:44] Religion is what keeps people saying
[1:48:46] Good Friday.
[1:48:48] Religion is what keeps people saying
[1:48:50] Easter Sunday. Religion is what keeps
[1:48:53] people saying Christmas is about the
[1:48:55] birth of Christ. Very few people really
[1:48:58] believe the
[1:48:59] lie, but they're blinded. God had to
[1:49:02] blind Paul and then send him to a dirty
[1:49:05] gentile
[1:49:07] to get his eyes opened.
[1:49:11] Ain't that just like God here? He sends
[1:49:14] a follower, a new follower of the Jewish
[1:49:16] Messiah down to a gentile to lay hands
[1:49:19] on him.
[1:49:21] Sends him down there to the house of
[1:49:23] Cornelius is what I meant to say. A
[1:49:26] gentile receiving the baptism of the
[1:49:29] Holy Ghost. That was Peter. Let's move
[1:49:31] on. Forgive me, I got off. Forgive me.
[1:49:35] Here is uh uh uh another message. Let me
[1:49:39] go back and read 18:21. Forgive me. But
[1:49:41] bathe them farewell, saying, I must by
[1:49:43] all means keep the feast that cometh to
[1:49:45] Jerusalem, but I will return again unto
[1:49:47] you if God will. And he sailed from from
[1:49:51] Ephesus. And I read you at the beginning
[1:49:53] 1 Corinthians, for even Christ our
[1:49:55] Passover. Two times we have mentioned
[1:49:58] where Paul is referring people back to
[1:50:01] the to the to the type to the shadow
[1:50:04] while maintaining the reality of who
[1:50:06] Jesus is. In the message Christ is the
[1:50:09] is is revealed not Christ is a mystery
[1:50:11] of God but in the message Christ is
[1:50:13] revealed in his own word. Paragraph 143,
[1:50:16] Brother Brandham said, "All right, the
[1:50:18] entire Bible is the entire revelation of
[1:50:23] Jesus Christ making himself known
[1:50:27] to every age, the entire
[1:50:31] Bible." So, we already had the potential
[1:50:34] of the revelation of Jesus Christ from
[1:50:36] the beginning. But it took a prophet, no
[1:50:40] doubt in my mind, it took a prophet with
[1:50:43] a commission from God to come and tie
[1:50:45] those things together and help us
[1:50:48] understand what types and shadows and
[1:50:51] symbols are. Amen. And now we embrace it
[1:50:54] and we move forward. Jesus revealed
[1:50:57] himself through these shadows. And
[1:50:59] there's so much more that we could say.
[1:51:02] I'll skip another two pages, but I'll
[1:51:04] read a verse from Luke 24. I was going
[1:51:06] to read nearly the whole chapter, no
[1:51:09] time. But let's go to verse
[1:51:12] 27 of Luke 24. And beginning at Moses
[1:51:18] and all the prophets, he Jesus, he Jesus
[1:51:23] expounded unto them in all the
[1:51:26] scriptures, read it for me,
[1:51:30] the things concerning himself. He meets
[1:51:32] these two road men on the road to Emmas
[1:51:35] and they're talking about these events
[1:51:38] that have unfolded in Jerusalem and
[1:51:40] Jesus begins preaching to them. And he
[1:51:42] starts where? At Moses. He starts at the
[1:51:47] shadow. He talks about the feast. He
[1:51:50] talks about all of the things that Moses
[1:51:52] ministry did and how God led his people
[1:51:55] out and how God is revealed in the
[1:51:57] Shabbat and how God is revealed in in uh
[1:52:00] Pesak and how God is revealed in Sakote
[1:52:03] and how God is revealed in a and in uh
[1:52:06] Shàuote
[1:52:08] and
[1:52:09] Skot. He he taught them from Moses and
[1:52:13] the prophets in the scriptures all the
[1:52:16] things concerning himself and they
[1:52:19] didn't know who he
[1:52:20] was. In verse 31, and their eyes were
[1:52:23] opened and they knew
[1:52:25] him and he vanished out of their sight.
[1:52:28] You know what it took? It took more than
[1:52:30] teaching. It took the Holy Spirit of God
[1:52:34] opening their eyes and then they began
[1:52:36] to understand what he was saying about
[1:52:38] himself. Isn't that beautiful? And then
[1:52:41] in Luke 24, it goes on, remember that
[1:52:44] these two men from the road tomus, they
[1:52:46] make it to the
[1:52:47] disciples. They make it on into
[1:52:50] Jerusalem and they began to tell the
[1:52:52] disciples, "The Lord is risen indeed and
[1:52:54] has appeared to Simon." And they told in
[1:52:57] verse 35 what things were done in the
[1:52:59] way and how he was known of them in the
[1:53:02] breaking of bread. They are telling his
[1:53:04] own disciples. And as they thus spoke in
[1:53:08] verse 36, guess what happened? Jesus
[1:53:11] himself stood in the midst of them and
[1:53:13] said unto them, "Shalom, peace be unto
[1:53:16] you." What what kind of excitement that
[1:53:19] would have been. Here come two strangers
[1:53:22] in telling them, "I I've seen him. I've
[1:53:25] seen him. He taught us from the
[1:53:26] scripture who he was. Our eyes were open
[1:53:29] as we broke bread together. We know him.
[1:53:31] We saw him. He's alive." And they're
[1:53:33] telling it. And you can imagine the
[1:53:34] different emotions that the apostles are
[1:53:36] going through and all of all of a sudden
[1:53:38] Jesus not even using the door appears
[1:53:41] among them and says shalom unto you.
[1:53:43] Peace be unto you. Oh my. They were
[1:53:46] terrified and afraided and suppose
[1:53:49] they'd seen a spirit. What are you tr
[1:53:51] what are you troubled about? And you
[1:53:52] know the rest. But look at verse 44. And
[1:53:55] he said unto them, "These are the words
[1:53:57] which I spake unto you while I was yet
[1:54:01] with you, that all things must be
[1:54:03] fulfilled, all things." Somebody say,
[1:54:06] "All things." All things must be
[1:54:08] fulfilled which were written in the law
[1:54:10] of Moses and in the prophets and in the
[1:54:13] Psalms
[1:54:14] [Music]
[1:54:15] concerning
[1:54:16] me. None of it could be left hanging.
[1:54:20] None of it could be left unfulfilled.
[1:54:22] And if it was, then he could not be the
[1:54:25] promised one. He could not be the
[1:54:27] Messiah. Do you know how important it is
[1:54:29] to recognize that he was the Passover
[1:54:32] lamb and that he fulfilled? Now, while I
[1:54:35] may not believe that Jesus fulfilled
[1:54:37] Passover by his birth like some people
[1:54:39] teach, I am quite sure that he fulfilled
[1:54:43] the feast of Passover with his death.
[1:54:46] I'm pretty sure. I'm very sure. Let me
[1:54:48] not say, let me say totally sure. It's
[1:54:51] not about becoming Jewish to understand
[1:54:53] these things.
[1:54:55] You know, all the people that criticize
[1:54:57] because we have the first five books of
[1:54:58] Moses up there and they think that's the
[1:55:00] most outlandish thing they've ever heard
[1:55:02] and it must be we're Jewish and and they
[1:55:04] told this young man who came here last
[1:55:06] weekend, you know, you you better be
[1:55:07] careful because you they'll try to make
[1:55:09] you
[1:55:11] Jewish. Let me take a breath. Let me get
[1:55:15] some water. It's not about being Jewish.
[1:55:19] It's about looking at the shadow.
[1:55:22] It's about hearing what Jesus preached.
[1:55:25] Somebody said, "What did Jesus preach?"
[1:55:27] Uh, he preached to them that all things
[1:55:29] must be fulfilled which were written in
[1:55:31] the law of Moses and in the prophets and
[1:55:33] in the Psalms concerning him. All of it.
[1:55:37] How many of you know there was no New
[1:55:38] Testament yet?
[1:55:41] He was preaching from the scripture,
[1:55:43] from the law, from the from the law,
[1:55:46] from the five books of Moses, from the
[1:55:47] prophets, from the Psalms, the poetic
[1:55:50] book, and on and on and on. It's not
[1:55:52] about making anyone culturally Jewish.
[1:55:54] It's about getting a greater
[1:55:56] understanding of who the Messiah is and
[1:55:59] what his birth, ministry, and death,
[1:56:02] resurrection, what it has really meant
[1:56:04] to us and what it means to us that he
[1:56:09] fulfilled it all. Every bit of it, every
[1:56:11] piece of it. Look at Romans 2 with me
[1:56:14] quickly. And yes, I'm rushing. Uh 28:29.
[1:56:17] That's why I let myself get off and say
[1:56:20] something while ago that I didn't want
[1:56:22] to say. For he is not a Jew which is one
[1:56:25] outwardly.
[1:56:27] Neither is that circumcision which is
[1:56:30] outward, the cutting of the foreskin in
[1:56:32] the flesh. That's not what makes a Jew a
[1:56:34] Jew. You understand that, don't you? Now
[1:56:37] he said, but he is a Jew which is one
[1:56:40] inwardly. See, there's really nothing
[1:56:42] wrong with being a Jew inwardly.
[1:56:46] Come on. And circumcision is what? That
[1:56:50] of the heart in the spirit. and not in
[1:56:53] the letter whose praise is not of men
[1:56:56] but of God. So if someone says to you, I
[1:56:59] guess you think you're a Jew now, just
[1:57:00] say, not
[1:57:02] outwardly, but inwardly I am because
[1:57:05] I've had a circumcision of the heart.
[1:57:07] Hallelujah. I was once a wild olive
[1:57:10] branch, but I have now been grafted into
[1:57:12] the roottock, sir. And the very life of
[1:57:16] the cultivative olive is now flowing
[1:57:18] through my veins. And I have nothing to
[1:57:20] apologize for. It's not about legalism
[1:57:23] or following a bunch of rules. I
[1:57:24] wouldn't have you to do that. It's not
[1:57:26] about always studying and understanding
[1:57:28] what the rabbi said. Uh they only had
[1:57:31] opinion. It's not about trying to follow
[1:57:34] modern Judaism because it's just as
[1:57:37] corrupt as Judaism was in second temple
[1:57:39] period. You wouldn't want any part of
[1:57:42] that. It's not about making sure that
[1:57:45] you light your candles to the right or
[1:57:47] the left or the left or the right. It's
[1:57:49] not about that. It's about knowing what
[1:57:51] it means. It's about knowing who it is
[1:57:55] that has come to fulfill all of those
[1:57:58] things. Do we mention them? Sure. Do we
[1:58:01] mention them? Do I try to abstain from
[1:58:04] from ham sandwiches? I do. Do sometime
[1:58:07] do we talk? Yes. But it's not because we
[1:58:11] want to judge anyone else or because we
[1:58:14] want anyone to become an outward Jew.
[1:58:17] But I'm interested in being one
[1:58:19] inwardly. Amen. Amen. It sounds pretty
[1:58:23] appealing to me. It gives me a greater
[1:58:26] appreciation for the work of Christ.
[1:58:28] Look at Philippians 3. And and look look
[1:58:30] at this in John 4:24. There's too much
[1:58:32] to read here. Too many scriptures. Who
[1:58:34] would have ever prepared such a sermon
[1:58:36] as this? Thinking they could read all of
[1:58:38] these scriptures. John 4:24. God is a
[1:58:42] spirit, and they that worship him uh
[1:58:44] must worship him how? Spirit and truth.
[1:58:48] Spirit and truth. Spirit and truth.
[1:58:49] Spirit and truth. Look at Philippians
[1:58:51] 3:10 in the Amplified. I finally just
[1:58:53] didn't put them. Sometimes I put
[1:58:55] scriptures in all three, but but for my
[1:58:57] determined purposes that I may know
[1:59:01] him, that I may progressively
[1:59:06] be that I that's King James. This is
[1:59:11] amplified. For my determined purpose is
[1:59:14] that I may know him, that I may
[1:59:17] progressively become more deeply and
[1:59:19] intimately acquainted with him,
[1:59:21] perceiving and recognizing and
[1:59:23] understanding the wonders of his person
[1:59:26] more strongly and more clearly. And that
[1:59:28] I may in the same way come to know the
[1:59:31] power outflowing from his resurrection
[1:59:34] which it exerts over believers. and that
[1:59:36] I may so share his suffering as to be
[1:59:39] continually transformed in spirit into
[1:59:41] his likeness even to his death in the
[1:59:44] hope that I may know him.
[1:59:48] In the hope that I may know him
[1:59:51] and the
[1:59:53] power of his resurrection and the
[1:59:56] fellowship of his sufferings being made
[1:59:57] conformable unto his death is the King
[2:00:01] James. Now we can go
[2:00:03] on. I there's so much here, but I'd like
[2:00:07] to get to the message
[2:00:09] now. Jesus, the if I should take a title
[2:00:13] for this message, it would be Jesus, our
[2:00:15] Passover, the lamb who fulfills it
[2:00:18] all. And I want to show you these
[2:00:20] verses. We won't get too far. We'll be
[2:00:21] here Tuesday night probably doing the
[2:00:23] same thing. But it's okay. I'm not going
[2:00:25] to gloss over it. Spend too much time
[2:00:28] preparing it. So stay with me if you if
[2:00:30] you're able. The first thing we know
[2:00:32] about the Passover, the one that took
[2:00:34] place in Exodus, the first Passover from
[2:00:37] which we remember and commemorate and
[2:00:40] understand that Jesus eventually
[2:00:42] fulfilled and became our Passover lamb.
[2:00:44] The first instruction that was given to
[2:00:46] the children of Israel was that a lamb
[2:00:48] was to be chosen. The selection of the
[2:00:50] lamb was to take place on the 10th of
[2:00:53] Nissan, the 10th day of
[2:00:56] Nissan, which in Bible times would have
[2:00:58] been called the month of Abib or
[2:01:01] Avib. And it actually means the ripened
[2:01:05] grain. It is barley that comes to
[2:01:10] maturity at the time of Passover. Of
[2:01:13] course, not wheat. And so in Bible
[2:01:16] times, they would not only watch the the
[2:01:19] moon to see what time of the month it
[2:01:21] was, but they would not have the
[2:01:24] Passover, no matter what day of the year
[2:01:26] it was, no matter what the lunar moon
[2:01:28] was saying. They would not have the
[2:01:30] Passover until they could first go out
[2:01:31] in the field and find that there was
[2:01:34] barley that had come to maturity to be
[2:01:37] harvested. That would be the sign that
[2:01:39] they would know it's now time for
[2:01:41] Passover. They didn't have phones with
[2:01:44] calendars. They didn't have uh uh you
[2:01:46] know printed calendars hanging in their
[2:01:48] home and so they had to depend on what
[2:01:50] they had. And God said the first thing
[2:01:52] you're going to do is on the 10th day of
[2:01:54] Nissan you're going to uh pick a lamb.
[2:01:58] He goes on to say you are to inspect it
[2:02:02] for four days to ensure that it is
[2:02:05] without blemish. It would require a
[2:02:08] deliberate act of preparation. I heard
[2:02:11] R.J. in his prayer talk about
[2:02:14] preparation. It's important to
[2:02:16] understand that preparation is not
[2:02:18] accidental. Preparation is intentional.
[2:02:22] And God set the pattern in the Old
[2:02:24] Testament. If you're going to prepare
[2:02:26] yourself to meet the king, if you're
[2:02:28] going to prepare yourself to meet the
[2:02:29] Lord of the feast, then you will have to
[2:02:32] make preparation. First preparation is
[2:02:35] you will take a lamb on the 10th day of
[2:02:37] Nissan and you will keep him up until
[2:02:40] the 14th day of Nissan four days making
[2:02:44] sure that he remains pure. Exodus 12
[2:02:47] verse 3 and 4 speak ye unto all the
[2:02:50] congregation of Israel saying in the
[2:02:52] 10th day of the month they shall take to
[2:02:54] them every man a lamb according to the
[2:02:56] house of their fathers a lamb for an
[2:02:58] house. And if the household be too
[2:03:00] little for the lamb, let him and his
[2:03:02] neighbor next unto his house take it
[2:03:04] according to the number of the souls.
[2:03:05] Every man according to his eating shall
[2:03:08] make your count for the lamb. Now this
[2:03:12] was the requirement. Chosen on the 10th
[2:03:14] day, guarded for four days, offered, as
[2:03:17] we will learn in a moment, offered on
[2:03:19] the 14th day between the evenings. Look
[2:03:22] at John 12 verse 12- 19. It would be by
[2:03:27] temptation to go through the entire
[2:03:30] timeline of the last week of the life of
[2:03:34] Jesus. I've spent a lot of time with it
[2:03:37] this week. There were a few things I
[2:03:39] wanted to be able to see and prove from
[2:03:42] scripture. I wanted to know what I was
[2:03:45] talking about. And in order to do that,
[2:03:47] I made for myself a harmony of the
[2:03:50] gospels. It's interesting. You can buy
[2:03:53] them. You can download them. You can
[2:03:55] find them free. You can take it's very
[2:03:57] easy. A lot of times it'll just be the
[2:04:00] scripture address and it will tell you
[2:04:02] where a particular miracle is mentioned
[2:04:04] in Matthew, if it's mentioned in Mark,
[2:04:06] if it's mentioned in Luke, if it's
[2:04:08] mentioned in John, where it'll give you
[2:04:09] the address. It's called a harmony of
[2:04:12] the gospels. The problem with that is
[2:04:15] then you have to go and look up the
[2:04:16] verses and you have to read them for
[2:04:18] yourselves and remember what you read as
[2:04:21] you try to put them together. So I
[2:04:23] decided, although it would be very
[2:04:24] time-consuming, I would follow the Lord
[2:04:26] in the last seven days of his life, I
[2:04:29] would create for myself, not using any
[2:04:31] of the available resources, I would
[2:04:33] create for myself a harmony of the
[2:04:35] Gospels. It's over 100 pages long. And I
[2:04:38] would actually copy and paste every
[2:04:40] verse of scripture that pertained to a
[2:04:42] certain event in the life of Jesus in
[2:04:45] the last seven days of his life and read
[2:04:48] it at one time. everything that Matthew
[2:04:51] said, everything that Mark said,
[2:04:53] everything that Luke said, everything
[2:04:55] that John said, and compare it together
[2:04:58] in order to put together a more accurate
[2:05:00] timeline. You will be, if you were so
[2:05:03] inclined, you would be fascinated. You
[2:05:07] You can't remember all those details. I
[2:05:10] most definitely can't remember all those
[2:05:13] details. It was amazing. But that took
[2:05:16] several days to put together. And then I
[2:05:18] started on the timeline which took
[2:05:20] several days. I can't talk about that
[2:05:23] today. Time wouldn't allow me to.
[2:05:25] Perhaps even Tuesday night, it wouldn't
[2:05:27] allow me to. But I want to say a few
[2:05:29] things as I go along because it's going
[2:05:32] to be important for you to understand
[2:05:34] how he fulfilled how he fulfilled. How
[2:05:37] is he the Passover lamb? The New
[2:05:39] Testament said he became our Passover.
[2:05:41] How did he become our Passover? John
[2:05:44] 12:12. Look there. Be a student for a
[2:05:47] moment. Desire to look at it for
[2:05:50] yourself. Don't take my word for it.
[2:05:52] That wouldn't be
[2:05:54] good. Don't go hunt some podcast to
[2:05:57] hear. Hear your pastor today. Then go
[2:06:00] study it for yourself. John 12:12. On
[2:06:03] the next day, much people that were come
[2:06:05] to the feast, when they heard that Jesus
[2:06:08] was coming to Jerusalem, took branches
[2:06:11] of palm trees, and went forth to meet
[2:06:15] him, and cried,
[2:06:17] "Hosana,
[2:06:19] hosana, blessed is the king of Israel
[2:06:24] that cometh in the name of the Lord." We
[2:06:27] were singing Adonai. I don't know why
[2:06:30] Ben chose that. He chose an appropriate
[2:06:33] song. In that song, it says baruk haba
[2:06:40] bashim. It It's blessed is he who comes
[2:06:43] in the name. Barukabashim Adonai.
[2:06:47] Blessed is he who comes in the name of
[2:06:49] the Lord. And that's what they began to
[2:06:51] cry. Blessed is he who comes in the name
[2:06:54] of the Lord. He was riding on a donkey
[2:06:58] coming into Jerusalem on the 10th day of
[2:07:03] Nissan. The exact day that Israel was
[2:07:08] told in the original Passover to put the
[2:07:11] lamb, take the lamb, and inspect him for
[2:07:14] four days. What did Jesus do for the
[2:07:17] next four days? He was inspected.
[2:07:20] I'll show you that in a moment. In John
[2:07:23] 12 1 and 2, then Jesus 6 days before the
[2:07:30] Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus
[2:07:33] was which had been dead whom he raised
[2:07:36] from the dead. There they made him a
[2:07:39] supper and Martha served. But Lazarus
[2:07:42] was one of them that sat at the table
[2:07:45] with him. If you continue to read in
[2:07:47] John 12, you're going to read that Mary
[2:07:50] washed his feet. Mary anointed him with
[2:07:54] with oil. You're going to read that that
[2:07:57] took place in Bethany. The reason why we
[2:08:00] mention that is because it's one of
[2:08:03] those clues. It's one of those keys six
[2:08:07] days before Passover. Is that what it
[2:08:10] said in John 12:1? 6 days before
[2:08:12] Passover. We know that Passover begins
[2:08:17] sundown Nissan 14, which is the
[2:08:20] beginning of Nissan 15. Because in the
[2:08:26] in the Bible, the scripture tells us
[2:08:28] that a day begins in the evening and the
[2:08:32] evening and the morning were the first
[2:08:34] day and the evening and the morning were
[2:08:37] the second day. So just before the sun
[2:08:40] goes down can be Nissan 14 and sun drop
[2:08:44] down and it's all of a sudden Nissan 15.
[2:08:47] The day has changed on the Hebrew
[2:08:50] calendar. It's interesting to note that
[2:08:53] because by doing so, we know from Exodus
[2:08:57] that the Passover begins
[2:09:00] sundown on Nissan 14, which after the
[2:09:05] sunset is Nissan 15. We know that the
[2:09:10] lambs were killed, and we'll look at it
[2:09:13] in a moment. We know that the
[2:09:14] sacrificial lambs of Passover were
[2:09:16] killed between the evenings on Nissan
[2:09:20] 14, which was the preparation day for
[2:09:23] the next day, which is the feast of
[2:09:26] unleavened bread, which would be a high
[2:09:28] Sabbath. We know that from scripture. By
[2:09:31] by John telling us six days before
[2:09:35] Passover, he came to Bethany. We can
[2:09:38] count and we can find exactly what day
[2:09:41] he was in Bethany. He was there on
[2:09:46] Nissan 9, which was Thursday sunset to
[2:09:50] Friday sunset. In Matthew
[2:09:53] 21:8-9, here is another fulfillment. And
[2:09:56] a very great multitude spread garments
[2:09:58] in the way. Others cut down branches
[2:10:00] from the trees, strewed them in the way.
[2:10:02] And the multitudes that were uh went
[2:10:04] before and that followed cried what?
[2:10:07] Saying hosana to the son of David. These
[2:10:10] were people who knew he was the Messiah.
[2:10:12] Blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[2:10:15] the Lord. Hosana in the highest. And
[2:10:20] then we go to John 12 verse 12 through
[2:10:23] 19 that we just read a moment ago and it
[2:10:26] tells us on the next
[2:10:29] day on the next day much people that
[2:10:32] were come to the feast. So we then know
[2:10:35] that from one evening we have now began
[2:10:38] to move into the next day which would
[2:10:41] have been Sabbath. It would have been
[2:10:43] Shabbat, which makes it so incredible
[2:10:47] that this kind of procession and
[2:10:49] celebration was going on on the
[2:10:53] Sabbath, even the taking of palm
[2:10:56] branches. Now the the the trees would
[2:11:00] have been trimmed and all the le all the
[2:11:04] fronds that were hanging loose would
[2:11:06] have been already taken down for
[2:11:09] Passover because the city was to be
[2:11:12] inundated with multitudes of people. But
[2:11:16] there probably wasn't enough time.
[2:11:19] Josephus said sometimes a mess could be
[2:11:21] left. Some of these things were still
[2:11:24] scattered underneath the trees. Here he
[2:11:26] comes riding, fulfilling a prophecy.
[2:11:29] Another one that we can't talk about
[2:11:31] now, fulfilling
[2:11:33] Zechariah. A couple of other places it
[2:11:36] mentions how he comes meek and lowly and
[2:11:40] he's riding this little animal into town
[2:11:42] and the people are taking, the scripture
[2:11:44] said, taking palm branches. They're
[2:11:46] they're waving them before him. Oh, it
[2:11:50] didn't take long for the Pharisees to
[2:11:51] know what was going on. And they're not
[2:11:54] just saying, "Welcome, welcome, Jesus to
[2:11:56] town." They're saying, "Save us now,
[2:11:59] Hosana. Save us now. Save us now.
[2:12:03] Blessed is he who comes in the name of
[2:12:05] the Lord, thou son of David." They are
[2:12:07] declaring him publicly to be the Messiah
[2:12:10] of the Jews. This is the anointed one.
[2:12:13] He has come and it's taking place on the
[2:12:17] holy day. On a very, very holy day. We
[2:12:22] know that this is a Saturday. It's
[2:12:24] Nissan 10 now and we move into
[2:12:27] crucifixion week and Jesus is examined
[2:12:30] for four days. Let me just give you a
[2:12:32] list of who examines him, but I won't be
[2:12:34] able to give you the references uh read
[2:12:37] them, but I can give you the addresses.
[2:12:40] Number one, the chief priest and elders
[2:12:42] examine him. Matthew 21:23. Pilate
[2:12:45] examines him in Matthew 27
[2:12:49] 1-2
[2:12:51] 11-14
[2:12:53] 17-26. Then Herod examines him in Luke
[2:12:57] 23 6-12. And then Annus the high priest
[2:13:01] the co-enhagel he examines him in Luke
[2:13:04] 3:2 and in John 18 verse13 verse 24. And
[2:13:10] then Caiaphas the high priest uh
[2:13:12] examines him. John
[2:13:15] 11:49-53 18 chapter 18 verse
[2:13:19] 13-4 verse 19 verse 24 and verse 28 uh
[2:13:24] of John 18. And then
[2:13:27] Judas 1 2 3 4 5 6. So as the lamb was
[2:13:31] examined for four days by those who
[2:13:34] would offer it as an offering for the
[2:13:36] household, our Lord, our our Passover
[2:13:39] lamb was also examined by all of these
[2:13:41] different people over the course of
[2:13:43] course of four days. Questioned to to
[2:13:46] the to the hilt, questioned,
[2:13:50] tricked. They did everything they could
[2:13:53] to catch him. And if you want to read
[2:13:55] some of that, you can read it. It's
[2:13:57] there. I purposed to read to you one
[2:14:01] Judas the betrayer the one who sold him
[2:14:04] out. But I want you to know that in the
[2:14:06] last moment after the betrayal had taken
[2:14:09] place. I want you to know what Judas
[2:14:11] thought about him. It's it's interesting
[2:14:12] to read in Matthew 27:es 3-10. Then
[2:14:16] Judas, which had betrayed him, when he
[2:14:19] saw that he was condemned, repented
[2:14:21] himself, and brought again the 30 pieces
[2:14:24] of silver to the chief priest and
[2:14:26] elders, saying, I've sinned in that I
[2:14:29] have betrayed the innocent blood. And
[2:14:32] they said, What is that to us? See thou
[2:14:36] to
[2:14:37] that? Even the
[2:14:39] betrayer
[2:14:40] realizes, I have betrayed an innocent
[2:14:43] man. I've watched his life and I can
[2:14:47] find no fault in him. Isn't that what
[2:14:49] Pilate ends up saying? I find no fault
[2:14:51] in him. Didn't Pilate's wife warned in a
[2:14:55] dream say to her husband have nothing to
[2:14:57] do with the death of an innocent man?
[2:14:59] Didn't the Pharisees question him and
[2:15:01] the Sadducees questioned him? And he was
[2:15:04] questioned of the high priest examined
[2:15:07] carefully for four days. The centurion
[2:15:11] examined him even at the cross when he
[2:15:14] said truly this was the son of God. The
[2:15:19] repentant thief is another in Luke
[2:15:23] 23:39-43 when when he says to him uh
[2:15:29] Christ if thou be the Christ one of the
[2:15:32] one of the malfactors railed on him if
[2:15:35] thou be the Christ save thyself. But the
[2:15:38] other answering rebuked him, saying,
[2:15:39] "Dust not thou fear God, seeing thou art
[2:15:42] in the same
[2:15:43] condemnation?" Come on. He said, "But
[2:15:45] this man hath done nothing a miss." And
[2:15:47] he said unto Jesus, "Lord, remember me
[2:15:49] when thou comest into thy kingdom." If
[2:15:51] you want to read what the Pharisees had
[2:15:53] to say to him, you can find it in
[2:15:54] Matthew chap 22 15- 46. A long a long
[2:16:01] interaction. You say you're the son of
[2:16:03] David, so forth and etc. A and it goes
[2:16:06] on. He quotes scripture. He's quoting
[2:16:09] scripture back to them. The reality is
[2:16:12] he was a sinless and perfect lamb. And
[2:16:15] that is the second requirement for
[2:16:16] Passover found in Exodus 12:5. Your
[2:16:19] lamb, are you still here? Your lamb
[2:16:21] shall be without blemish, a male of the
[2:16:23] first year. You shall take it out from
[2:16:25] the sheep or from the goats. You've got
[2:16:27] to make sure that the lamb you choose
[2:16:29] for your house and for your neighbor's
[2:16:31] house, if necessary, is without blemish.
[2:16:34] How many of you believe he was? Hebrews
[2:16:37] 4:15. For we have not a high priest
[2:16:40] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[2:16:41] of our infirmities, but was in all
[2:16:43] points tempted like as we are. What does
[2:16:45] it say? Was he a perfect lamb? Was he a
[2:16:49] sinless sacrifice? Was he without
[2:16:51] blemish? John recognized it in John
[2:16:53] 1:29. The next day John seeth Jesus
[2:16:56] coming unto him. And look what he said.
[2:16:59] Behold the lamb of God which taketh away
[2:17:03] the sin of the world. John knew he was
[2:17:06] the Passover coming down the road. First
[2:17:09] Peter 1 Peter 1 18-20. For as much as
[2:17:13] you know that you were not redeemed with
[2:17:15] corruptible things as silver and gold
[2:17:17] from your vain conversation received by
[2:17:20] tradition from your fathers, but with
[2:17:21] what? The precious blood of Christ as of
[2:17:26] a lamb. What kind of lamb? a Passover
[2:17:29] lamb,
[2:17:30] without blemish and without spot, who
[2:17:34] verily was for ordained before the
[2:17:37] foundation of the world, but was
[2:17:38] manifest in these last times. I want
[2:17:41] everybody to scream out the next two
[2:17:43] words for you. for
[2:17:47] you powerful
[2:17:50] in the amplified verse 19 says but you
[2:17:52] were purchased with the precious blood
[2:17:54] of Christ the Messiah like that of a
[2:17:56] sacrificial lamb without blemish and
[2:17:59] without spot number three the third
[2:18:01] requirement the first was choose a lamb
[2:18:04] the second requirement was it should be
[2:18:06] a spotless lamb the third requirement
[2:18:08] the lamb should be slain by the whole
[2:18:10] assembly it wasn't killed by the priest
[2:18:13] it was killed by the people. Interesting
[2:18:16] to note, the Passover lamb was killed by
[2:18:19] the whole assembly. Exodus 12:6, "And
[2:18:22] you shall keep it up until the 14th day
[2:18:25] of the same month, and the whole
[2:18:27] assembly of the congregation of Israel
[2:18:29] shall kill it
[2:18:31] when in the
[2:18:34] evening." Can't talk about that
[2:18:37] yet. Acts chapter 4 verse 26- 28. I'll
[2:18:43] give you these, but not until I'm
[2:18:44] finished with them. But when I'm
[2:18:46] finished, if you want the notes, you can
[2:18:48] have them. The kings of the earth stood
[2:18:50] up, and the rulers were gathered
[2:18:52] together against the Lord, and against
[2:18:54] his Christ, for of a truth, against the
[2:18:56] holy child Jesus, whom thou hast
[2:18:58] anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate,
[2:19:00] with the Gentiles, and the people of
[2:19:02] Israel were gathered together, the whole
[2:19:04] assembly, for to do whatsoever thy hand
[2:19:07] and thy counsel determined before to be
[2:19:09] done. This is the apostle preaching
[2:19:12] after after the Holy Ghost has fallen on
[2:19:14] the day of Pentecost. Acts chapter 2.
[2:19:17] He's reminding them that he was examined
[2:19:20] in front of everybody. They all saw him.
[2:19:24] They all agreed. We're killing an
[2:19:26] innocent man. And yet they did it
[2:19:28] anyway. Thank you, God. Thank you. Thank
[2:19:30] you, Lord. Romans 5'8. But God
[2:19:34] commendeth his love toward us in that
[2:19:36] while we were yet sinners, guess what
[2:19:38] happened? Messiah died for us. The whole
[2:19:41] assembly killing the lamb together types
[2:19:44] the collective role of humanity. The
[2:19:46] Jewish leaders, who you going to blame?
[2:19:49] Who are you going to blame? The Jewish
[2:19:50] leaders, Pontius Pilate? Are you are you
[2:19:53] going to blame Herod? Are you going to
[2:19:55] blame Caiaphas? Are you going to blame
[2:19:56] Annos? Who you going to blame for
[2:19:58] killing him? The only one you could
[2:19:59] blame is his father. Right. The whole
[2:20:02] assembly examined him, but his father's
[2:20:05] the one who not only didn't stop it. It
[2:20:09] was his idea.
[2:20:12] Matthew
[2:20:13] 27:22-25, Pilate saith unto them, "What
[2:20:15] shall I do then with Jesus which is
[2:20:17] called Christ?" They all say unto him,
[2:20:18] "Let him be crucified." And the governor
[2:20:21] said, "Why? What evil hath he done?"
[2:20:22] They didn't even answer, but they cried
[2:20:24] the more, "Let him be crucified." No
[2:20:27] answer. What has he done? Let him be
[2:20:29] crucified, they said. When Pilate saw
[2:20:31] that he could prevail nothing, but that
[2:20:32] rather tumult was made. He took water,
[2:20:35] washed his hands before the multitude,
[2:20:36] saying, I am innocent of the blood of
[2:20:38] this just person. See you to it. Then
[2:20:40] answered all the children and said, His
[2:20:42] blood be on us and on our children. What
[2:20:44] an awful curse to bring on themselves.
[2:20:46] It was a necessary, it was a necessary
[2:20:48] thing. Ephesians 5:16. And that he might
[2:20:51] reconcile both unto God in one body by
[2:20:55] the cross, having slain the enmity.
[2:20:59] Thereby he brought two worlds
[2:21:01] together, Jew and Gentile. Number four,
[2:21:05] the fourth requirement, the lamb's
[2:21:07] slaughter on Nissan 14, the Old
[2:21:09] Testament type. In the evening of the
[2:21:11] 14th day of Nissan around 300 p.m., the
[2:21:14] lamb was to be killed. That was the
[2:21:16] requirement. How do we know that?
[2:21:18] Because the scripture says in Exodus
[2:21:20] 12:6, "And ye shall keep it until the
[2:21:22] 14th day." Didn't you just read that?
[2:21:24] Yes. But the emphasis was on the whole
[2:21:26] assembly. Now, the emphasis on killing
[2:21:28] it in the evening. You shall keep it up
[2:21:30] until the 14th day of the same month,
[2:21:31] and the whole assembly of the
[2:21:33] congregation of Israel shall kill it
[2:21:34] when? But that's not what it says in the
[2:21:38] original. In Hebrew, it actually says
[2:21:42] between the two
[2:21:47] evenings. Now, gentile gentile
[2:21:51] translators in the time of King James
[2:21:55] would have had no idea what that meant
[2:21:58] in
[2:22:00] Hebrew, Ben
[2:22:03] haim, between the two evenings. So, they
[2:22:06] translated it in the evening. But in
[2:22:09] Hebrew it says two evenings. You know
[2:22:11] why? Because the Jews had two evenings.
[2:22:14] They believe that the first evening was
[2:22:15] at 3:00 in the afternoon when the
[2:22:18] evening sacrifice was
[2:22:19] killed and the second was at 6:00 just
[2:22:23] before the sunset. So when the scripture
[2:22:27] says that the Passover lamb in Exodus 12
[2:22:30] should be killed in the evening, it
[2:22:33] really says between the two evenings and
[2:22:36] that would have been somewhere between
[2:22:37] 3:00 and
[2:22:39] 6:00 near sunset. So that's a threehour
[2:22:43] period of time that the lambs would have
[2:22:45] been killed between 3:00 in the
[2:22:48] afternoon and 6:00 in the afternoon on
[2:22:50] Nissan the 14th. Do you follow that? We
[2:22:53] know by the scripture that Jesus was
[2:22:56] crucified. I'm not even waiting on my
[2:22:58] notes, am I? I'm just uh speeding
[2:23:00] through. Sorry. Jesus was crucified on
[2:23:03] Passover Nissan 14. At the exact time I
[2:23:06] want you to say exact time. at the exact
[2:23:09] time the lambs were being slain. That
[2:23:12] aligned his death with the timing of the
[2:23:16] feast of Passover. He couldn't have been
[2:23:18] called the Passover
[2:23:19] lamb if he was killed two or three days
[2:23:22] after the Passover lambs were killed.
[2:23:27] Let's just say for instance, the
[2:23:28] Passover lambs were killed on Wednesday
[2:23:30] that week on the Gregorian calendar.
[2:23:33] Then our Lord would have had to have
[2:23:34] been crucified at the very same time,
[2:23:37] Wednesday.
[2:23:39] They couldn't have said, "Well, he's
[2:23:41] bigger than the than the type. He's
[2:23:43] bigger than the shadow, so we're going
[2:23:45] to crucify him two days later." No. No.
[2:23:49] It had to be precise. It had to be
[2:23:51] accurate. He had to fulfill it to the
[2:23:53] jot. He had to fulfill it to the tit. I
[2:23:56] know you already know this, but I'm here
[2:23:58] to tell you, he did
[2:24:00] without any shadow of interpretation. I
[2:24:03] don't care who called it Good Friday.
[2:24:06] It is impossible.
[2:24:09] It could not have happened on a Friday.
[2:24:13] Because you cannot get three days and
[2:24:15] three nights, which was the prophesied
[2:24:18] sign of Jonah. That's right. Oh, yeah.
[2:24:22] But the Jews counted partial days.
[2:24:24] That's right. But what about the nights?
[2:24:31] There's no way in the world it can be
[2:24:34] three days and three nights from Friday
[2:24:37] at 3:00 until Sunday morning 6:00 a.m.
[2:24:41] You might get parts of
[2:24:43] days. You actually only get a part of a
[2:24:45] day, part of a Saturday. I mean, a whole
[2:24:47] Saturday, part of a Friday, whole
[2:24:49] Saturday, f one Friday night, one
[2:24:51] Saturday night, and then after sunset.
[2:24:55] That's not That's not three days and
[2:24:57] three nights. If you called it three
[2:24:59] days, you'd be you'd be stretching it,
[2:25:01] but you could never call it three days
[2:25:03] in three nights. And did you know it was
[2:25:05] the only sign that Jesus ever spoke
[2:25:07] about that had to be fulfilled, right?
[2:25:13] He said, "They're always asking for a
[2:25:15] sign, but no sign will be given to them
[2:25:17] except the sign of Jonah."
[2:25:22] The sign of Jonah, as Jonah was in the
[2:25:24] belly of the whale three days and three
[2:25:25] nights, so shall the son of man lay in
[2:25:28] the heart of the
[2:25:31] earth. But I think brother Brandham
[2:25:34] said, good for it doesn't matter who
[2:25:35] said it. This is no, this is no
[2:25:36] reflection on anybody. It's tradition
[2:25:39] and sometimes we say things by
[2:25:41] tradition.
[2:25:44] Some of you will call next Sunday Easter
[2:25:46] Sunday. There's no such thing. But you
[2:25:48] don't mean that you're going to
[2:25:49] celebrate Easter, do you? Not here.
[2:25:52] You're not.
[2:25:54] You'll have to find another place to do
[2:25:55] it. I don't care how cute the kids look.
[2:25:58] I don't care how cute the Easter bunny
[2:25:59] is. I don't care how cute the Easter
[2:26:01] eggs are. Not here. You won't.
[2:26:05] We are not celebrating that here. But we
[2:26:08] might refer to it and thinking, well, is
[2:26:10] that Easter Sunday? We might say that,
[2:26:12] hadn't we?
[2:26:15] So, we say things by tradition sometime,
[2:26:18] but if the scripture doesn't bear it
[2:26:20] out, if the scripture says three days
[2:26:22] and three nights, and what does it have
[2:26:24] to be?
[2:26:26] I can feel you. I can feel some of you.
[2:26:28] You're already feeling your loved ones.
[2:26:30] You're expecting the call. Some of you
[2:26:31] are getting texts already.
[2:26:35] This is our life. This is the life we
[2:26:36] live.
[2:26:39] Can you imagine someone coming from
[2:26:40] another state to visit the church,
[2:26:42] someone texting him during the preaching
[2:26:43] and saying to him or why are you at
[2:26:47] Shell's? I hope somebody has the courage
[2:26:49] to say because I want to be.
[2:26:52] What's it to you? That that's how
[2:26:55] carefully closely we are watched and
[2:26:57] scrutinized. What does it feel like to
[2:27:00] be the attraction on the mountain?
[2:27:03] But I'm going to tell you what they
[2:27:04] hear. If they listen, they're going to
[2:27:06] hear something on the word.
[2:27:09] Jesus fulfilled it. And we know how this
[2:27:12] operated. We can go we can go through
[2:27:15] it. We know that. We know that uh uh
[2:27:18] well,
[2:27:20] shall I finish a little more?
[2:27:25] The lamb's slaughter between the two
[2:27:27] evenings. John
[2:27:29] 19:14 through 16. And it was the
[2:27:31] preparation of the Passover.
[2:27:35] It was the preparation of the Passover.
[2:27:37] That's Nissan
[2:27:40] 14. Nissan 15 is the feast of unleaven
[2:27:44] bread. Did you know that while Passover
[2:27:47] is a part of the feast of unleven bread,
[2:27:49] it's it's a separate feast. It's
[2:27:51] connected, but not the same. The next
[2:27:54] day, the first day of the feast of
[2:27:56] unleaven bread was a high Sabbath.
[2:27:59] There's seven of them in the year. And
[2:28:01] that's what they weren't thinking about
[2:28:03] when they said the body had to be taken
[2:28:04] down before the Sabbath. They're
[2:28:07] thinking that is the weekly Sabbath.
[2:28:09] They're not remembering that in the
[2:28:11] scripture it talks about the high
[2:28:13] Sabbath. The high Sabbath is the
[2:28:15] beginning of a holy feast which would
[2:28:19] have been the Thursday.
[2:28:23] So he has to
[2:28:25] die and be taken down and
[2:28:29] buried before
[2:28:31] sunset because that is the beginning of
[2:28:34] the feast of unleaven bread. The day he
[2:28:36] died, Nissan 14th was the preparation
[2:28:39] day for the Passover. And about the
[2:28:41] sixth hour, and it was the preparation
[2:28:44] of the Passover, and about the sixth
[2:28:45] hour, and he saith unto the Jews, behold
[2:28:49] your king. But they cried out, "Away
[2:28:52] with him! Away with him! Crucify him!"
[2:28:56] Pilate said unto them, "shall I crucify
[2:28:58] your king?" The chief priest answered,
[2:28:59] "We have no king but Caesar." Can you
[2:29:04] imagine the religious leaders, the
[2:29:06] priest of the works of
[2:29:09] God acknowledge the pagan Roman Caesar
[2:29:15] as their king?
[2:29:17] Look what compromise was required in
[2:29:20] order to send him to his
[2:29:24] death, the sixth
[2:29:29] hour. And when the sixth hour, Mark 15,
[2:29:33] and when the excuse me, 15 verse
[2:29:36] 33-37, and when the sixth hour was come,
[2:29:39] there was darkness over the whole land
[2:29:41] until the 9th hour. That is from
[2:29:46] 3:00, excuse me, that is from the 6th
[2:29:50] hour to the 9inth hour. That is from
[2:29:52] noon until
[2:29:54] 3:00. And at the 9inth
[2:29:57] hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice,
[2:29:59] eloi, eloi, lama sabakani, which is
[2:30:03] being interpreted, my God, my God, why
[2:30:07] hast thou forsaken me? We know exactly
[2:30:09] when he died. He died at the 9th hour,
[2:30:14] 3:00 on Nissan 14, the day before the
[2:30:19] feast of unleavened bread. It's in the
[2:30:21] scripture. And some of them that stood
[2:30:24] by when they heard it said, "Behold, he
[2:30:25] called for Elias." And one ran and
[2:30:27] filled a sponge full of vinegar and put
[2:30:29] it on a reed and gave him to drink,
[2:30:31] saying, "Let alone, let us see whether
[2:30:32] Elias will come to take him down." And
[2:30:34] Jesus cried with a loud
[2:30:37] voice and gave up the
[2:30:40] ghost. 3:00 p.m. the 9th hour just after
[2:30:44] and Josephus who was a historian during
[2:30:46] the time of Christ records in his book
[2:30:50] wars
[2:30:52] 6.93 that's chapters and trackctates and
[2:30:54] verses fulfilling the exact time he
[2:30:57] mentions the exact time that the lambs
[2:31:00] were killed. And it was just between 3
[2:31:04] and 6 on Nissan 14. So there it is. He
[2:31:07] fulfilled it. He fulfilled it to the
[2:31:09] letter. Died at the very same time. Do
[2:31:12] you understand that? Do you understand
[2:31:13] what I'm saying to you? Jesus died at
[2:31:17] the exact time that all the other lambs
[2:31:20] were
[2:31:21] dying. If we started looking and we
[2:31:24] can't today, but if we start looking at
[2:31:25] the things that happened, not just the
[2:31:27] earthquake, not just the the darkness,
[2:31:30] but then the earthquake and then the
[2:31:31] veil of the temple rent and twain from
[2:31:33] top to bottom and then the dead get
[2:31:36] up. There's no missing this event. God
[2:31:39] knew what he was doing. Are you with me?
[2:31:42] And then here's another type. Blood.
[2:31:44] Blood is a type. Blood is what caused
[2:31:48] the death angel to pass over the
[2:31:50] children of Israel in the first
[2:31:52] Passover. What is it that causes the
[2:31:55] destroyer to have to take his hands off
[2:31:57] of you? Don't you know he'd like to drag
[2:32:00] you to a devil's hell? But he can't drag
[2:32:03] you. He can't destroy you. Why? Because
[2:32:06] of the blood. The blood of the lamb.
[2:32:09] Exodus 12:7. They shall take of the
[2:32:12] blood and strike it on the two side post
[2:32:15] and on the upper uh post of the houses
[2:32:17] wherein they shall eat it. Exodus 12:13
[2:32:20] and 14. Now the blood shall be a sign
[2:32:22] for you on the houses where you are. And
[2:32:25] when I see the blood, I will pass over
[2:32:28] you and the plague shall not be on you
[2:32:31] to destroy you when I strike the land of
[2:32:34] Egypt. Look at Hebrews 9 11:12. See if
[2:32:38] he fulfilled. But Christ being come a
[2:32:41] high priest of good things to come, by a
[2:32:43] greater and more perfect tabernacle, not
[2:32:45] made with hands, that is to say, not of
[2:32:47] this building, neither by the blood of
[2:32:50] goats or calves, but by his own blood.
[2:32:54] He entered in once into the holy place,
[2:32:58] having
[2:32:59] obtained temporary forgiveness,
[2:33:02] yearly forgiveness,
[2:33:05] eternal redemption
[2:33:08] for
[2:33:09] us. Romans 5'8 and9 again. But God
[2:33:12] commanded his love toward us in that
[2:33:14] while we were yet sinners, Christ died,
[2:33:16] shed his blood for us, much more than
[2:33:18] being now justified by his blood, we
[2:33:21] shall be saved
[2:33:23] from the death angel from the wrath. How
[2:33:27] how is it through
[2:33:29] him? As the blood was a token on the
[2:33:33] doorpost, the blood of Christ is a token
[2:33:37] upon the heart of the redeemed. We
[2:33:40] understand from the message of the hour
[2:33:41] that now the life that was in that
[2:33:43] blood, the Holy Ghost has become a token
[2:33:46] for us in the third Exodus. And we give
[2:33:48] God thanks for that. Amen. Number six,
[2:33:51] no broken bones. The Old Testament type
[2:33:54] is Exodus 12:46. In one house shall it
[2:33:57] be eaten. Thou shalt not carry forth.
[2:33:59] It's 130. Thou shalt not carry forth out
[2:34:01] of the flesh abroad, out of the house,
[2:34:03] neither shall you break a bone thereof.
[2:34:06] These are specific instructions given
[2:34:08] concerning the Passover lamb. Don't take
[2:34:10] it out in the
[2:34:11] yard. This stays in the
[2:34:14] house. If in one house shall ye be
[2:34:16] eaten, thou shalt not carry forth no
[2:34:18] togo boxes abroad out of the house, and
[2:34:23] neither shall ye break a bone thereof.
[2:34:25] You can eat the the flesh. You must you
[2:34:28] must eat it all but you cannot break a
[2:34:31] bone to get to the meat. Why? It's such
[2:34:34] a specific instruction. This was not the
[2:34:37] instruction given about all the
[2:34:38] offerings but this is a specific
[2:34:40] instruction that not only says it must
[2:34:42] be without blemish when you kill it. Now
[2:34:44] it says that even after its death you
[2:34:46] must not break a bone. Numbers 9:12.
[2:34:49] Here's another another reason. They
[2:34:51] shall leave another uh scripture
[2:34:53] supporting scripture. They shall leave
[2:34:55] none of it until the morning, nor break
[2:34:57] any bone of it, according to all the
[2:34:59] ordinances of the Passover, they shall
[2:35:01] keep it. Now, if brother Brandham didn't
[2:35:03] have any respect for Passover, like some
[2:35:06] people would almost have us to think,
[2:35:08] except it was just a little bit of a
[2:35:09] glimmer of shadow and it's all fulfilled
[2:35:12] and no need to even mention it again.
[2:35:14] Why is it that he tells us in
[2:35:15] instructions of taking communion?
[2:35:20] Why is it that he tells us that we
[2:35:21] should take the bread that's been
[2:35:22] blessed and burn
[2:35:26] it so that none of it is left over for
[2:35:29] the morning? You do know that he taught
[2:35:31] that about communion. The bread, why?
[2:35:34] Because the bread is what we eat in
[2:35:36] communion representing the lamb. The
[2:35:38] bread is a representation of the lamb,
[2:35:41] the lamb of God slain from the
[2:35:42] foundation of the world. You understand
[2:35:43] that? And brother Bram's explaining to
[2:35:45] us the ways to carry this out. And he
[2:35:47] said, "Now, you know, that should be
[2:35:48] taken out and
[2:35:49] burned because the scripture said none
[2:35:52] of it should be left of the morning."
[2:35:53] Here is brother Brandham
[2:35:56] connecting the Lord's supper, the
[2:35:58] communion service to
[2:36:03] the my even though when I give you the
[2:36:07] timeline, I'll show you that the meal
[2:36:09] that Jesus shared with his disciples was
[2:36:11] was an abridged version. It wasn't the
[2:36:15] whole Passover meal. There was no time
[2:36:17] that would have been h that would have
[2:36:18] happened while he was
[2:36:20] buried. This was something that he did
[2:36:24] because he said, "I desired I desire to
[2:36:27] eat the Passover with you. This is the
[2:36:29] best we can do, so to speak. We're going
[2:36:32] to remember." And he did something very
[2:36:33] strange because he takes that third cup,
[2:36:36] the cup of
[2:36:37] redemption, and he raises it up. And
[2:36:39] what does he say this time? This was not
[2:36:41] a part of the celebration of the
[2:36:43] Passover Savior. He takes that cup now
[2:36:45] and he says this
[2:36:47] cup, this cup has always represented the
[2:36:50] redemption. It represents the shed blood
[2:36:52] of the lamb of the Passover. But today
[2:36:55] he said to them something entirely
[2:36:56] different. He said, "This cup is the new
[2:36:59] testament in my blood."
[2:37:05] He was borrowing from the
[2:37:08] old and yet he was making a new
[2:37:11] covenant that we could move forward
[2:37:14] with. Not destroying the old but
[2:37:18] fulfilling the old. So, no, it wasn't
[2:37:20] that. It wasn't the the seder meal
[2:37:24] because the seder meal would not have
[2:37:26] taken place until that
[2:37:28] night after the sun had set and it would
[2:37:32] then be going into the new
[2:37:34] day. But he celebrated this meal early
[2:37:37] with it. Somebody said, "That bothers
[2:37:38] me. That doesn't fulfill the tie." Well,
[2:37:40] that wasn't a required That wasn't
[2:37:42] required. The lamb didn't have to do
[2:37:44] that. That wasn't a part of what was
[2:37:45] required of the lamb. He was the lamb,
[2:37:48] right? All he had to do was bleed and
[2:37:50] die. Come on. All right. Here. Here is
[2:37:53] this. Let's go there. No. No bone should
[2:37:55] be broken according to all the
[2:37:56] ordinances of the Passover, they shall
[2:37:58] keep it. Now, let's see if that if that
[2:37:59] fits Jesus. John 19
[2:38:03] 31-36. The Jews therefore because it was
[2:38:05] the preparation that the body should not
[2:38:07] remain upon the cross on the Sabbath
[2:38:09] day. For that Sabbath day was an high
[2:38:11] day. Now we have that
[2:38:16] and that right there ought to be enough
[2:38:19] to show everyone that he didn't die on a
[2:38:22] Friday.
[2:38:27] But they would rather hold to their
[2:38:29] tradition. They besought Pilate that
[2:38:31] their legs might be broken and that they
[2:38:33] might be taken away. The Jews said all
[2:38:35] of their legs should be broken. We've
[2:38:37] got to make sure that they're dead and
[2:38:39] we've got to get them buried.
[2:38:42] Because this is
[2:38:45] preparation and tomorrow we begin the
[2:38:47] feast of unleaven bread. Well, really
[2:38:49] it's sundown. Then came the soldiers and
[2:38:53] break the legs of the first and of the
[2:38:56] other which was crucified with him. Why
[2:39:00] didn't they break his legs? They had to
[2:39:03] skip
[2:39:06] him. They broke the first they they come
[2:39:09] over. They broke this one. He's in the
[2:39:11] middle. We We've always come to
[2:39:14] believe. Why did they break his legs?
[2:39:17] Because he had to fulfill the Passover.
[2:39:21] You want to keep calling it Easter?
[2:39:24] He doesn't even know what you're talking
[2:39:25] about.
[2:39:29] It's like Polycarp. He said, "We've
[2:39:31] always we've always commemorated the
[2:39:33] death of Jesus Christ on Nissan 14,
[2:39:36] which is the Passover.
[2:39:39] Why would we want to change that
[2:39:42] now? This has always been the
[2:39:45] celebration, but it was the adulteration
[2:39:47] of the word. What else happened at 325
[2:39:50] AD? Baptism was adjusted and the
[2:39:52] Godhead, a new Godhead was
[2:39:54] created. 3:25 was a terrible year for
[2:39:57] the church.
[2:39:59] Many, many compromises were made. It was
[2:40:01] decided from that day on that
[2:40:03] resurrection would be celebrated on a
[2:40:05] Sunday.
[2:40:08] it would no longer be announced as three
[2:40:10] days after the
[2:40:12] Passover. That's all the early church
[2:40:14] was doing was was just, you know,
[2:40:16] remembering it, giving God thanks for
[2:40:18] the resurrected Savior. But now we will
[2:40:21] separate it from Passover and we will
[2:40:24] set it by the sun to be on Sunday
[2:40:28] always, which shifts the calendar in all
[2:40:30] kinds of crazy directions. And that's
[2:40:32] why sometimes we have Easter a month
[2:40:34] away from Passover or Passover happening
[2:40:36] and it's another month until Easter
[2:40:38] time. It's because of what was decided
[2:40:41] at the Nyine Council. Does that matter?
[2:40:43] Well, it mattered to brother Brandham
[2:40:44] about the Godhead and it mattered to
[2:40:46] brother Brandham about the It mattered
[2:40:47] about the didn't it? So, so to me, I'm
[2:40:50] looking Yeah, it matters to me. It
[2:40:52] matters to me that Constantine decided
[2:40:55] that we will no longer associate the
[2:40:58] death and the resurrection with Christ
[2:41:00] with the Passover feast. He spoke it.
[2:41:01] It's in it's in writing. You can read it
[2:41:03] for yourself. We will have it so
[2:41:06] separated from Passover that it will
[2:41:08] have nothing Jewish about it. And we're
[2:41:11] going to do that to honor Christ and to
[2:41:14] and to forget the Christ
[2:41:20] killers. The Sunday Easter celebration
[2:41:25] was an act of anti-semitism.
[2:41:27] It was another act of hatred toward the
[2:41:29] Jews who they blamed solely, completely,
[2:41:33] totally for killing the
[2:41:36] Lord. You know better than that, don't
[2:41:38] you? Oh, they they made some stupid
[2:41:41] decisions and paid for it greatly. But
[2:41:44] Paul tells us they only did what they
[2:41:46] could. Their eyes were blinded. Who
[2:41:50] blinded their eyes? Not the priests, not
[2:41:52] the Pharisees, not the Sadducees, not
[2:41:54] the scribes. Who blinded their eyes?
[2:41:57] God. He blinded their eyes so they
[2:42:00] couldn't recognize who he was. Why?
[2:42:02] Because a few of those branches had to
[2:42:05] be broke off the olive tree so that you
[2:42:08] and I of the wild olive could be grafted
[2:42:11] in.
[2:42:13] Hallelujah.
[2:42:16] So don't so really we owe the we owe the
[2:42:18] the Jewish people a debt of gratitude
[2:42:20] and we owe Israel our prayers.
[2:42:26] He loved Israel above them
[2:42:28] all. Amen.
[2:42:31] And so uh but when they came to Jesus,
[2:42:34] verse 33, and saw that he was dead
[2:42:37] already, they break not his legs. Had
[2:42:41] they broken his legs, you and I could
[2:42:44] have wondered. We could have wondered.
[2:42:46] Mankind could have wondered through the
[2:42:48] ages. How could he be? How could Paul
[2:42:50] call him the Passover lamb? How could he
[2:42:52] be the one who was coming to fulfill the
[2:42:54] spring feast? How could his death secure
[2:42:57] redemption if there was a type
[2:43:00] broken? Remember what brother Brandham
[2:43:02] says about types being broken? Remember
[2:43:04] what he says about the fact that instead
[2:43:06] of uh speaking to the rock the next
[2:43:08] time, they struck it again. Did you hear
[2:43:11] what he said? He said it threw the whole
[2:43:12] thing off cater.
[2:43:15] Breaking one part of a tight can can
[2:43:17] throw everything off cater. It's as
[2:43:20] important as making sure everybody's
[2:43:22] sitting in the right chair. If a vision
[2:43:24] is unfolding, right? It's about making
[2:43:28] sure that if a service is to be what God
[2:43:30] saw that it was going to be before the
[2:43:32] foundation of the world, that you're
[2:43:33] where you're supposed to be.
[2:43:40] If he saw it and if he saw you here,
[2:43:42] then here's where you would need to be.
[2:43:44] Well, how do I know that? We must walk
[2:43:46] in the spirit. We must make our
[2:43:49] decisions by the spirit. We must make
[2:43:52] our choices by the spirit, not by our
[2:43:56] flesh. Is anybody here? So it's vitally
[2:44:00] important. But he said now uh found him
[2:44:03] dead already breaking not his legs but
[2:44:05] one of the soldiers with a spear pierced
[2:44:08] his side and forth with came there out
[2:44:11] blood and water. Brother Brandham said
[2:44:13] that was his bride being separated from
[2:44:15] his side. And he that saw it bear record
[2:44:18] and his record is true. and he knoweth
[2:44:20] that he saith true that you might
[2:44:21] believe. For these things were done that
[2:44:24] the scripture should be fulfilled. A
[2:44:27] bone of him shall not be broken. It's
[2:44:30] right there in the book. It's right
[2:44:32] there in the book of John. Passover is
[2:44:35] fulfilled because the lamb has no bone
[2:44:40] broken. And then the then then the
[2:44:42] seventh and I'll
[2:44:44] close. I think I have
[2:44:46] 13, but I'll try to stop on number
[2:44:49] seven. The lamb was to be eaten as a
[2:44:53] memorial. The Old Testament type, Israel
[2:44:55] ate the lamb with bitter herbs,
[2:44:57] unleavened bread, remembering
[2:44:59] deliverance. That's what they were told
[2:45:00] to do in Exodus. Exodus 12:8. And they
[2:45:02] shall eat the flesh, that's the flesh of
[2:45:05] the lamb, in that night, roast with fire
[2:45:08] and unleavened bread and with bitter
[2:45:10] herbs, they shall eat it. Luke chap 22:1
[2:45:14] 15-20. And he said unto them with
[2:45:18] desire, I have desired to eat the
[2:45:21] Passover with you before I suffer. For I
[2:45:25] say unto you, I will not anymore eat
[2:45:29] thereof until it be fulfilled in the
[2:45:33] kingdom of
[2:45:35] God. And he took the cup.
[2:45:39] Now, some would look at that and they'd
[2:45:41] say, "Oh, he's saying this is the
[2:45:43] Passover." When I read it, he's saying
[2:45:46] something entirely different. I would
[2:45:49] have loved to have stayed
[2:45:51] around. I would have left to have been
[2:45:53] here for the Passover
[2:45:56] meal. It would have been my desire. And
[2:45:59] I say unto you, I will not anymore take
[2:46:01] take thereof, eat thereof, until it be
[2:46:03] fulfilled in the kingdom of God. So this
[2:46:05] was this was something like an evening
[2:46:08] meal like a seder. It was absolutely
[2:46:11] something that was on occasion done. It
[2:46:13] was done for special reasons. And I and
[2:46:16] I have no problem believing that that's
[2:46:17] what he was doing. Go going through as
[2:46:19] much of the story as possible. But it
[2:46:22] not being at the perfect time as the sun
[2:46:26] goes down on the beginning of the feast
[2:46:28] of unleven bread. He said this and he
[2:46:30] took the
[2:46:32] cup and gave thanks and said take this
[2:46:36] and divide it among yourselves for I say
[2:46:39] unto you I will not drink of the fruit
[2:46:41] of the vine until the kingdom of God
[2:46:44] shall come. And he took bread. He gave
[2:46:56] thanks and said, "Take, eat, or take
[2:46:59] this and divide it among yourselves. For
[2:47:02] I say unto you, I will not drink of the
[2:47:04] fruit of the
[2:47:05] vine until the kingdom of God shall
[2:47:08] come." Excuse me, go back to verse 16.
[2:47:10] For I say unto you, I will not eat more,
[2:47:12] excuse me, I will not anymore eat
[2:47:14] thereof until it be fulfilled in the
[2:47:15] kingdom of God. And he took the cup and
[2:47:17] he gave thanks and said, "Take this and
[2:47:19] divide it among yourselves." And he took
[2:47:21] bread, verse 19, "and gave thanks and
[2:47:23] break it and gave it unto them, saying,
[2:47:25] "This is my body which is given for you.
[2:47:28] This do in remembrance of me." Likewise
[2:47:32] also the cup after he took the cup after
[2:47:34] after supper, saying, "This cup is the
[2:47:38] new testament in my blood which is shed
[2:47:42] for you." Verse 20.
[2:47:47] So it was bread now representing the
[2:47:51] lamb. How do we know that? Because he
[2:47:53] said this is my
[2:47:55] body. This represents my body. Take and
[2:47:58] eat this. So when we have that uh sacred
[2:48:03] moment of communion where we commemorate
[2:48:06] our Lord's last evening with his
[2:48:09] disciples, we are also commemorating the
[2:48:12] Passover because he is the perfect
[2:48:14] fulfillment of the Passover. If you
[2:48:17] believe that, I'd like to hear you say,
[2:48:19] "Amen." Amen. Let's
[2:48:23] stand. Musicians are coming.
[2:48:27] I'd like to sing the hymn. I
[2:48:32] remember. I remember. I want to tell the
[2:48:35] world I
[2:48:36] remember. Tuesday night, we'll finish
[2:48:38] this little teaching and we might speak
[2:48:41] a minute about the about the
[2:48:45] timing. We'll just say say it like this.
[2:48:48] If our Lord fulfilled the Passover, we
[2:48:50] know that he died
[2:48:52] 3:00 between the evenings on Nissan
[2:48:58] 14 as the sun went down. This was on a
[2:49:01] Wednesday. As the sun went down on a
[2:49:03] Wednesday
[2:49:05] night, Wednesday night would have been
[2:49:08] the first
[2:49:10] night. The Jews believe there were 12
[2:49:12] hours in a night. We know that's not
[2:49:14] exactly the way it is according to the
[2:49:16] daylight. and 12 hours in the day.
[2:49:19] That's how they measure time. 12 hours
[2:49:21] in the day, 12 hours in the night. In
[2:49:23] fact, they called an evening time 12
[2:49:25] hours and a morning or daytime 12 hours.
[2:49:29] They divided the 24 hours completely in
[2:49:31] half. So, we know that if he died 3:00
[2:49:35] in the afternoon, laid in the tomb by
[2:49:37] sunset, we
[2:49:39] count Wednesday night, all day Thursday,
[2:49:44] Thursday night, all day Friday, Friday
[2:49:50] night being the third night. That's
[2:49:54] what's missing if you put him anywhere
[2:49:57] else. Three days, three nights. Has
[2:50:00] anybody ever read that in your Bible?
[2:50:03] Oh, you
[2:50:04] haven't? I didn't hear you. Well, good.
[2:50:07] I I I'm glad I didn't hear you because
[2:50:10] I'll read it to
[2:50:12] you. I'm pretty sure I have it here. Uh
[2:50:15] I I have it somewhere in the notes, but
[2:50:17] it's Matthew. It's in Matthew. Uh if you
[2:50:20] know, if you can find it quickly. I
[2:50:22] thought I had it right here, but I must
[2:50:23] have closed it when I got excited.
[2:50:29] You see where I am? Is it there? For as
[2:50:33] Jonas was three days and three nights in
[2:50:37] the whale's belly, so shall the Son of
[2:50:39] Man be.
[2:50:41] Three days and three nights in the heart
[2:50:44] of the earth. Somebody said, "Well, a
[2:50:45] few other places it just says three
[2:50:47] days." Yes, that's right. But that's not
[2:50:49] what it says here.
[2:50:51] Are we going to ignore this because
[2:50:55] uh it doesn't fit our our uh
[2:51:00] interpretation or are we going to say
[2:51:02] that this is kind of serious? Can you go
[2:51:04] back? Can you go back and and and give
[2:51:06] me a verse or two before that? Maybe I
[2:51:08] thought it was like
[2:51:11] 38. Is that 40? I can't see my glasses.
[2:51:15] That's 38. Go back a few. Um yes. Then
[2:51:18] certain of the scribes and of the
[2:51:19] Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we
[2:51:21] would see a sign from thee. But he
[2:51:24] answered, and said unto them, An evil
[2:51:25] and adulterous generation seeketh after
[2:51:27] a sign, and there shall no sign be given
[2:51:30] to it, but the sign of the prophet
[2:51:36] Jonas, Yona the dove. For as Jonas was
[2:51:40] three days and three nights in the
[2:51:43] whale's belly, so shall the Son of Man
[2:51:46] be. three days and three nights in the
[2:51:49] heart of the earth. Do you believe
[2:51:50] that's what the scripture said? So,
[2:51:52] Wednesday at
[2:51:55] 3:00, Thursday being the first day,
[2:51:57] Wednesday night being the first night,
[2:51:59] Thursday night being the second night,
[2:52:01] Friday being the second
[2:52:04] day, Friday
[2:52:06] night, third
[2:52:10] night. And how about we take this look
[2:52:12] while you're here because so many of you
[2:52:14] are missing next Sunday.
[2:52:18] Why don't we take this look real quick?
[2:52:20] While you're standing, stretch your
[2:52:22] legs. I I don't think I want to leave
[2:52:24] this
[2:52:25] out, but I've got to find
[2:52:29] it. I wasn't prepared. I knew I'd never
[2:52:32] get that
[2:52:34] far. Cleansing of the
[2:52:40] temple. Oh my. I'm just getting to I'm
[2:52:43] just getting to Habib 14.
[2:52:46] I'm coming. I'm
[2:52:48] coming. I'm coming. It's
[2:53:02] here. John 20 verse
[2:53:08] one. The first day of the week. Oh, you
[2:53:11] you won't might not even have it there.
[2:53:19] Oh, I must have it in
[2:53:21] the first day of the week cometh Mary
[2:53:24] Magdalene early when it was yet
[2:53:27] dark into the supplr and seeth the stone
[2:53:32] taken away from the suppler. There's a
[2:53:35] key
[2:53:37] there. when it was yet
[2:53:47] dark. We know it wasn't 6:00 in the
[2:53:52] morning. When it was yet
[2:53:56] dark, she came to the supplr and found
[2:54:00] the stone was gone. Look at the next
[2:54:01] verse. The first then she runth and
[2:54:06] cometh to Simon Peter and to the other
[2:54:09] disciple whom Jesus loved and saith unto
[2:54:11] them, they have taken away the Lord out
[2:54:14] of the supplr and we know not where they
[2:54:17] have laid him. Do you get it? Do you
[2:54:19] understand that he got up before the
[2:54:25] sun? Did he rise on the first day of the
[2:54:28] week? Yes, because that started at
[2:54:29] sundown on Saturday. But was it broad
[2:54:32] daylight? Absolutely not. The Bible
[2:54:35] refers to it in several places. I think
[2:54:36] in another place it's it uses another
[2:54:39] description. Uh very early in the
[2:54:42] morning in Luke it says they
[2:54:44] came. And in Matthew it says as it began
[2:54:49] to dawn toward the first day of the week
[2:54:54] came Mary Magdalene and then the Mary.
[2:54:56] But we know, we know when he raised from
[2:54:59] the
[2:55:00] dead. And so when we look at that
[2:55:02] timeline that's been fed to us all these
[2:55:05] years, we realize there's absolutely
[2:55:07] absolutely no way. If he had to fulfill
[2:55:09] it, he had to fulfill it all. Because
[2:55:12] remember, the resurrection was to
[2:55:14] fulfill the feast of first
[2:55:17] fruits. So we know exactly when the
[2:55:19] feast of first fruits was beginning. So,
[2:55:22] we know that he had to be up in Adam to
[2:55:25] fulfill the rest of the story. Isn't it
[2:55:27] wonderful that that God would give us
[2:55:30] these signs in his word? Can you give me
[2:55:34] the words to the hymn I remember? We're
[2:55:36] going to let you go. I know you have a
[2:55:38] war slap out because I
[2:55:40] am. Let's sing this old hymn. Sister
[2:55:43] Laurel, I know you know
[2:55:44] it. Cage probably never heard it in his
[2:55:47] life.
[2:55:49] I Let's go up just a little
[2:55:53] bit. I remember how my savior died for
[2:55:58] me on the rugged cross of dark mount
[2:56:04] Calvary. Oh, I remember how he died,
[2:56:08] cried, how he bowed his head and died. I
[2:56:12] remember dark Calary.
[2:56:17] Oh, I remember how he paid the debt for
[2:56:22] me. How his blood was shed on dark
[2:56:28] Calary. Oh, the blood of Calvar's brow.
[2:56:32] I still see it flowing now. I remember
[2:56:37] dark Calary.
[2:56:41] Oh, I remember how he blessed and broke
[2:56:45] the
[2:56:46] bread. It signifies my broken body. Thus
[2:56:51] he
[2:56:52] said, "Oh, this is my blood." He said,
[2:56:57] "And for many it was shed." I remember.
[2:57:02] [Music]
[2:57:06] Oh, I remember how he paid the debt for
[2:57:10] me. My God. Woo. How his blood was shed
[2:57:14] on dark
[2:57:17] Calary. Oh, the blood of Calvar's grow.
[2:57:22] I can see it
[2:57:25] [Music]
[2:57:27] flowing. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. I
[2:57:32] remember how
[2:57:35] he
[2:57:37] wine that which is the fruitage of the
[2:57:43] vine. Oh, this is my blood. He said for
[2:57:49] many. Oh, I
[2:57:52] [Music]
[2:57:53] remember. Sing that like you mean it.
[2:57:56] Oh, I remember how he paid the debt for
[2:58:02] me. How his blood was shed on dark
[2:58:06] calary.
[2:58:13] [Music]
[2:58:21] Oh, I remember how he blessed and broke
[2:58:25] the
[2:58:27] bread. It signifies my broken body. Thus
[2:58:32] he
[2:58:33] said, "Oh, this is my blood."
[2:58:39] Oh, that's not
[2:58:41] it. Let me sing that verse again.
[2:58:45] Someone has transpose the words over. I
[2:58:48] remember how he blessed and broke the
[2:58:52] bread. It signifies my broken body. Thus
[2:58:58] he
[2:58:58] [Music]
[2:58:59] said, broken on the cruel tree hanging
[2:59:04] there for you and me. I remember dark
[2:59:10] calary.
[2:59:13] Oh, I remember how he paid the debt.
[2:59:18] Hallelujah.
[2:59:20] [Music]
[2:59:27] Oh, this is
[2:59:29] Hallelujah. I can see it.
[2:59:34] I
[2:59:37] remember the last verse. I remember.
[2:59:40] Just remember how they pierced him in
[2:59:44] the
[2:59:46] side from which flowed the precious
[2:59:49] healing cleansing
[2:59:52] tide. Well, it was shed for you and me
[2:59:57] that from sin we might be
[3:00:01] free. I
[3:00:04] remember. Well, glory to God. I remember
[3:00:09] how he paid the debt for
[3:00:13] me. How his blood was shed on dark
[3:00:19] Calary.
[3:00:22] Oh my my my
[3:00:25] [Music]
[3:00:31] my one more time.
[3:00:34] I remember how he paid the debt for me.
[3:00:40] Did he do it? How his blood was shed on
[3:00:44] dark.
[3:00:48] Oh, this.
[3:00:52] [Music]
[3:01:02] How many of you remember
[3:01:05] Oh,
[3:01:07] it's why we're here.
[3:01:10] It's why we're together.
[3:01:12] I can see this this old song when we
[3:01:15] sing it. I see the saints when I was
[3:01:18] young. This was not a in that day. It
[3:01:22] wasn't a solemn song. This was a dancing
[3:01:25] song. I've seen those sisters dance
[3:01:27] their hair down. Oh, I remember how he
[3:01:29] paid the debt for me.
[3:01:32] I remember how his blood was shed for
[3:01:37] me. Oh, the blood of Calvar's brow. I
[3:01:40] still see it flowing now. I remember
[3:01:43] dark Calvary. It's good for you and I to
[3:01:46] remember dark
[3:01:50] Calvary. When a little couple, young
[3:01:52] couple have been coming here to church
[3:01:54] for some years. I'm not I've never been
[3:01:57] clear. I don't know how in the world you
[3:01:59] could sit here for
[3:02:01] years and think we believed in a
[3:02:04] trinity. Honestly, I don't think they
[3:02:06] cared. But all of a sudden, when someone
[3:02:08] mentioned to him we didn't believe
[3:02:11] Trinity, another
[3:02:12] critic, they just thought it was just
[3:02:15] uncchristian.
[3:02:17] And one of the things that he said to me
[3:02:19] in our in our interchanges with each
[3:02:21] other is every other
[3:02:24] church, every other church for hundreds
[3:02:26] of years has believed that God was three
[3:02:29] persons. To not believe it is
[3:02:32] unorthodox and
[3:02:37] uncchristian. And you'd be surprised how
[3:02:40] many people share such an opinion as
[3:02:41] that. And they would hear this this
[3:02:43] morning say the same thing. Good
[3:02:46] Friday. But the reality is this. Once
[3:02:49] you see that God is not three
[3:02:53] persons, you I don't see how you could
[3:02:55] ever see it any other way. Do you? Once
[3:02:58] that is real to
[3:03:00] you. And so when you hear someone talk
[3:03:03] about a trinity, you just say, "Well,
[3:03:04] yeah, uh, in the sense that man is a
[3:03:08] trinity." Brother Bram said that too.
[3:03:11] Man is a trinity.
[3:03:15] He actually used the words at I think at
[3:03:17] least once
[3:03:21] triunityity but he also said trinity
[3:03:23] which is three in one and man is that
[3:03:27] body soul and spirit but one person. So
[3:03:31] if that's the way God's a trinity, I'm
[3:03:33] for it. Father, Son, Holy Ghost. But
[3:03:37] then when you say three
[3:03:39] persons, you give this this a creature,
[3:03:42] whatever he is, you give him a each
[3:03:45] person a life of their own. And how do I
[3:03:48] know they're going to operate as one?
[3:03:51] And so it's important to know the
[3:03:52] difference.
[3:03:54] Amen. I don't care how many nine
[3:03:56] councils say otherwise. I don't care how
[3:03:59] many Catholic churches say otherwise.
[3:04:02] Hello.
[3:04:03] I have friends that wore the ashes on
[3:04:05] their forehead, too. Where do you read
[3:04:08] that in the Bible that you come on
[3:04:10] Wednesday and get ashes on your head
[3:04:12] during Lent? And yet, you'll see movie
[3:04:15] stars and newscasters now right on
[3:04:17] television, right on the news with the
[3:04:20] with the ashes on their forehead made in
[3:04:22] a cross. And they're very thankful,
[3:04:24] proud to show such a Christian symbol,
[3:04:26] not even understanding that it's
[3:04:28] absolutely bogus,
[3:04:31] fake. It doesn't mean
[3:04:34] anything. There's probably a lot of
[3:04:36] things we don't yet know. But I'm glad
[3:04:38] for what I do know. Aren't you? Let's
[3:04:40] come worship the Lord just a minute.
[3:04:42] It's
[3:04:42] 2011. That's not bad. Could be worse.
[3:04:47] If I would have preached for every hour
[3:04:49] I
[3:04:50] studied, it'd be a marathon. We'd still
[3:04:53] be here
[3:04:57] Tuesday. I wanted it to be right. And I
[3:04:59] do continuing going forward. I want to
[3:05:01] be right. I believe that is the mandate
[3:05:03] we're under to take it to the
[3:05:06] word. And if that is the case, then then
[3:05:09] R.J. in his prayer was absolutely right.
[3:05:11] Yesterday, I said to my family,
[3:05:13] yesterday, today on the on the Jewish
[3:05:16] calendar would be the
[3:05:17] day that at 3:00 in the afternoon, he
[3:05:20] would have hung his head, excuse me, and
[3:05:24] gave up the
[3:05:25] ghost. His spirit left him, and it was
[3:05:30] necessary. He became the perfect
[3:05:35] substitute for all my sin.
[3:05:40] He who knew no sin became
[3:05:45] sin. The son of God became the son of
[3:05:50] man. That we, the fallen sons of men,
[3:05:53] could become sons of God.
[3:05:57] Oh, what a great love story.
[3:06:01] Wouldn't you think it's worth getting it
[3:06:03] right?
[3:06:05] Ben, come and lead us in a worship song.
[3:06:09] I just want to love him. I just want to
[3:06:13] thank him. I don't I can't grasp it all
[3:06:16] the
[3:06:17] time, but today I'm
[3:06:20] grasping where I would be. Just think of
[3:06:22] it a moment. Where you would be had he
[3:06:26] not fulfilled it all the way to the
[3:06:28] letter, took it on himself.
[3:06:34] 26 times in a
[3:06:40] mass. 26 times in a mass, the priest
[3:06:44] crosses
[3:06:47] himself which forms an inverted cross
[3:06:50] which is
[3:06:53] satanic. The sign of the cross that the
[3:06:56] Catholics do is inverted and it is
[3:06:58] satanic. It has absolut absolutely
[3:07:01] nothing to do with Jesus and there's no
[3:07:05] concept of what he did on the cross. I
[3:07:08] would rather not have to find some
[3:07:12] symbol but I would rather know by
[3:07:15] revelation the reality of what he did
[3:07:17] for me and what he did for you on the
[3:07:19] cross.
[3:07:22] If you look at that
[3:07:26] evening where only two two cups are
[3:07:32] mentioned, it looks a lot like a
[3:07:37] betroal. It looks a whole lot like a
[3:07:41] ceremony where a young man would offer a
[3:07:44] cup of wine to a young
[3:07:48] woman. Will you be mine?
[3:07:52] And if there was no way that she could
[3:07:54] accept his proposal, she would push the
[3:07:58] cup. But if she would accept the
[3:08:02] proposal, she would take the cup of wine
[3:08:04] and she would take a big drink of it and
[3:08:07] put it down. It was a symbol of of
[3:08:09] saying yes to the proposal.
[3:08:13] I think that those
[3:08:15] disciples said
[3:08:19] yes. They were a mixed up
[3:08:23] crew. People have tried to portray them
[3:08:25] and and the best they could do is show
[3:08:27] them as
[3:08:28] human because that's what they were.
[3:08:34] But when Jesus turns to
[3:08:38] them and he says they're going to
[3:08:42] deliver you
[3:08:43] up, it's a different
[3:08:46] Peter when Peter screams out at the at
[3:08:50] what we call the last supper. No Lord,
[3:08:51] I'll never betray you. You know, I'll
[3:08:54] never That's one Peter.
[3:09:01] When Jesus turns and he begins to tell
[3:09:03] them, "You're going to
[3:09:04] be delivered up and killed for my name's
[3:09:09] sake, the
[3:09:13] shock." But now he's gone. He appears to
[3:09:16] him again. He has sinned. And something
[3:09:19] happens to those
[3:09:21] disciples because they were faithful to
[3:09:23] the end.
[3:09:25] If you study their
[3:09:27] lives, you'll know that they
[3:09:30] were horribly martyed, murdered,
[3:09:34] massacred for his
[3:09:40] name. Sometimes we don't even want
[3:09:42] people to know what we
[3:09:46] believe. In a moment that they could
[3:09:48] have denied him, they gave their lives
[3:09:52] willingly for his name's sake. You may
[3:09:55] never have to give your physical life,
[3:09:56] but the best that we can do, the least
[3:09:59] that we can do is to give him everything
[3:10:01] that we have. Lord, I want to live for
[3:10:04] you. I want to serve you. I could never
[3:10:07] repay you. I could never give you enough
[3:10:09] back for what you've given
[3:10:12] me. But I'll give you my life. I'll give
[3:10:16] you my yes. I'll give you my amen. And
[3:10:19] I'll give you my surrendered will if
[3:10:21] you'll come and use that.

[3:15:30] Glory.
[3:15:36] You are good Lord Lord. Thank you.
[3:15:40] Thank you for your price.
[3:15:43] Thank you for fulfilling scripture.
[3:15:46] Thank you.
[3:15:49] Thank you Lord.
[3:15:56] Oh, to be a Christian,
[3:16:00] to be a child of God,
[3:16:05] to worship you in
[3:16:07] spirit and in truth.
[3:16:32] You're beautiful Jesus in every way.
[3:16:34] You're beautiful, Lord.
[3:16:55] So if it's
[3:16:57] right, his body would be
[3:17:01] laying in a cold tomb on this day many
[3:17:06] years
[3:17:07] ago. But he wasn't there.
[3:17:11] He was busy.
[3:17:13] He was
[3:17:18] preaching. He appeared
[3:17:20] in what we call
[3:17:23] paradise where the righteous dead
[3:17:26] were. Only a gulf separated it from
[3:17:32] hell. Brother Brandham preached it to
[3:17:37] us. when he appeared, the the Old
[3:17:40] Testament saints saw him.
[3:17:43] And David said, "He's the one I sung to
[3:17:46] on the hills." And Shadrach, Meach, and
[3:17:50] Abednego said, "There he is, the one who
[3:17:52] was with us in the in the furnace." And
[3:17:55] Abraham said, "There he is, the one that
[3:17:58] broke the bread in my house, my
[3:18:01] tent." Each one recognized him. He led
[3:18:05] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[3:18:07] men. and taking the keys of hell and the
[3:18:10] grave and death. He conquered it all.
[3:18:14] Yes, he did.
[3:18:15] Hallelujah. But not until three days and
[3:18:18] three nights had
[3:18:20] expired. And then up from the heart of
[3:18:22] the earth, he
[3:18:25] arose. He lives
[3:18:27] today. He lives today. So when we come
[3:18:30] next Sunday, he will have already been
[3:18:32] risen for days.
[3:18:36] And so we ought to come, those of us who
[3:18:38] were here, we ought to come celebrate.
[3:18:40] We ought to come Tuesday night
[3:18:42] celebrating the resurrected Lord.
[3:18:45] How many of you believe he's alive?
[3:18:48] Would you just join your faith with
[3:18:50] someone near you right now? Maybe put
[3:18:51] your hand on them
[3:18:54] and just pray for their strength. Lord,
[3:18:57] as we leave this house
[3:19:01] today, it's not our desire to be
[3:19:03] different just to be
[3:19:06] different. In fact, it's just not
[3:19:09] easy. But Lord, we thank you for your
[3:19:11] word. It's life to us. And we ask you to
[3:19:15] strengthen the saints right now.
[3:19:18] whatever they face in life and whatever
[3:19:20] they might would face because of this
[3:19:21] message. I I pray that they will be safe
[3:19:24] and protected and kept in body, soul,
[3:19:26] and
[3:19:28] spirit, encouraged to stand on the word.
[3:19:31] And may they not feel obliged to argue
[3:19:34] with anybody or debate with anybody, but
[3:19:37] just to go forth and be the be the life.
[3:19:40] May we just be the life and be the
[3:19:42] light. It doesn't change. It doesn't
[3:19:44] change what was accomplished.
[3:19:47] You fulfilled it all. We're so
[3:19:50] thankful. Would you bring healing, Lord?
[3:19:53] Maybe the one that we're praying for
[3:19:54] right now needs a healing touch. You're
[3:19:57] the healer. You're Jehovah Rafa. Would
[3:20:00] you bring healing? Would you curse every
[3:20:02] symptom, the root, the
[3:20:05] cause? Let miracle healing manifest in
[3:20:09] their body for the glory of God. Lord,
[3:20:13] watch over those who are traveling and
[3:20:15] who will yet travel.
[3:20:18] We'll give you praise and honor and
[3:20:19] glory for it's in the name of Jesus
[3:20:21] Christ. The saints said, "Amen." I don't
[3:20:25] want to wear you out. I've done that
[3:20:26] with the preaching. I want you to have
[3:20:28] freedom to leave. You're dismissed in
[3:20:31] the wonderful name of the Lord. If you
[3:20:32] want to tar a moment with someone, you
[3:20:34] can. You want to tar a moment for
[3:20:36] worship, you can. But otherwise, you are
[3:20:39] dismissed to go in his name. that the
[3:20:45] lamb may
[3:20:47] receive. Oh, God bless you, honey. I
[3:20:50] love you.
[3:20:52] For his suffering,
[3:20:56] that
[3:20:58] lamb may
[3:21:01] receive his
[3:21:05] reward through
[3:21:08] me. Hallelujah.
[3:21:12] [Applause]
[3:21:14] [Music]
[3:21:16] Go with a hallelujah in your heart.
[3:21:20] Go thanking him.
[3:21:23] Hallelujah.
[3:21:27] In spite of what day he died, what day
[3:21:29] he rose, he did. He did and he lives
[3:21:34] forever more.
[3:21:36] that the lamb
[3:21:39] may receive
[3:21:43] his
[3:21:45] reward for his
[3:21:49] [Music]
[3:21:52] suffering may
[3:21:56] receive his
[3:21:59] reward for
[3:22:03] me. Hallelujah.
[3:22:15] [Music]
[3:22:16] Hallelujah.
[3:22:17] [Music]
[3:22:23] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:22:31] that the
[3:22:33] lamb may
[3:22:37] receive his
[3:22:40] reward for his
[3:22:44] suffering. That the
[3:22:47] lamb may
[3:22:51] receive his
[3:22:54] reward through me.
[3:23:02] Hallelujah.
[3:23:05] Yeah.
[3:23:06] [Music]
[3:23:11] Hallelujah.
[3:23:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
