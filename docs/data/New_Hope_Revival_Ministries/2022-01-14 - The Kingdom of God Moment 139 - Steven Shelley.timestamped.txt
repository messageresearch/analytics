[0:00] lives are changed when we understand
[0:03] that we're a part of the kingdom of god
[0:12] you my brother sister have been born by
[0:16] the transforming and translating power
[0:20] of the holy spirit out of the darkness
[0:23] of this world out of the kingdom of men
[0:26] out of the kingdom of darkness out of
[0:29] the kingdom of this world and into the
[0:32] kingdom of god
[0:34] we look for the kingdom of heaven but we
[0:37] have already been translated into the
[0:41] kingdom of his dear
[0:44] son and that kingdom is an unshakable
[0:48] kingdom it is an unmovable kingdom
[0:51] in fact it's the original kingdom it's
[0:53] not the perverted one that we call
[0:56] planet earth the environment and society
[0:59] around us is a perverted society and a
[1:02] perverted atmosphere from the original
[1:05] that god created in eden
[1:07] we're not just going back to pentecost
[1:09] but the word has restored us all the way
[1:12] back to eden
[1:14] it means dominion
[1:16] it means authority
[1:19] it means a people who are so much in
[1:22] tune with the kingdom of god that they
[1:25] are not movable they are not shakeable
[1:30] lives are changed when we understand
[1:33] that we're a part of the kingdom of god
[1:37] there's a great contrast between what we
[1:41] know and understand around us
[1:44] and what we carry in us
[1:46] because even in the time of jesus we're
[1:48] told that his kingdom
[1:51] was not with a physical throne
[1:54] in a palace in jerusalem
[1:56] but his kingdom
[1:58] was
[1:59] in the hearts of men
[2:01] [Music]
[2:03] the kingdom of god was established in
[2:05] the hearts of men the roman occupation
[2:08] it just kept going on
[2:10] until finally it destroyed the city of
[2:12] jerusalem and burned the holy temple and
[2:14] so forth after christ
[2:16] had already gone
[2:18] so his coming didn't do too much to
[2:20] change the political environment
[2:24] because he wasn't here to preach another
[2:26] political kingdom
[2:28] he was here to preach and demonstrate
[2:30] the kingdom of god and when he sent the
[2:32] disciples forth he sent them forth to
[2:34] preach the kingdom of god
[2:37] and that means their whole focus was not
[2:39] kingdom of heaven
[2:42] because that was a future experience and
[2:44] expression
[2:45] when we get to heaven we know
[2:47] everything's going to be all right
[2:49] i want you to know we're not there yet
[2:51] we got to have something to hope in now
[2:53] we have to have something to hold on to
[2:55] now we need the kingdom of god among us
[2:58] now we need to understand who we are in
[3:00] the kingdom now
[3:02] we need to think like kingdom people now
