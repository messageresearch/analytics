[1:00] hello there I'm Pastor Steven Shelley
[1:03] I'm coming to you from the good old
[1:06] state of Alabama New Hope revival
[1:08] ministries we're just delighted to be
[1:11] able to speak to you today on behalf of
[1:14] brother Eric Erickson and the gospel
[1:16] channel what an amazing blessing that
[1:20] God is giving the world from that tiny
[1:23] little island of Iceland I don't know if
[1:26] you've ever visited Iceland but I'm
[1:28] telling you it's a beautiful place when
[1:31] I think about a nation a little island
[1:33] with such a small population less than
[1:36] four hundred thousand and yet God gave
[1:38] our brother Erickson a vision much
[1:41] bigger than Iceland he had a vision a
[1:45] desire to reach the entire world with
[1:49] the truth with a revelation of Jesus
[1:51] Christ and that's why God is blessing
[1:54] the gospel channel in times like this so
[1:57] I ask you to join me in prayer praying
[2:00] that God will continue to sustain the
[2:03] ministry and that he will expand it and
[2:05] allow it to reach out until every nation
[2:08] is being reached touched by the gospel
[2:12] of Jesus Christ through the gospel
[2:14] Channel I realize there are many
[2:16] Christian television networks around the
[2:19] globe but my heart is intricately
[2:22] connected with the gospel channel and
[2:24] I'm believing that together we're going
[2:27] to see the vision that God gave brother
[2:29] Erickson absolutely manifest and come to
[2:33] pass so not only partner with us in
[2:35] prayer but continue your giving and if
[2:38] you've never taken an opportunity to sow
[2:41] into the Ministry of the gospel channel
[2:44] I can tell you by personal experience
[2:46] it's not a wasteful place they're
[2:49] prayerful they're mindful the things
[2:52] that they do to expand the network or
[2:54] carefully prayed over fasting goes on
[2:58] and what they do they do by the direct
[3:00] leadership of the Lord so I just want
[3:03] you to know I'm standing with them and
[3:05] we invite you to
[3:06] and with them as well I believe in the
[3:09] power of prayer and so we invite you
[3:11] anytime during this program call us in
[3:14] the state of Alabama I don't know what
[3:17] hour you're watching but there's a
[3:18] number a toll-free number available for
[3:21] you on the screen we may not be in the
[3:23] office if it's in the middle of the
[3:25] night Alabama time but I promise you
[3:27] we'll take your message we'll hear it in
[3:30] fact I hear them personally on my
[3:32] computer and I'll go to prayer for you
[3:35] and so will the saints who worship here
[3:38] at new hope revival ministries why
[3:40] because we love you because we care
[3:43] about you and because we have
[3:45] experienced for many many years now the
[3:48] power of agreement in prayer in faith
[3:51] and we want to see God move on your
[3:54] behalf in this exciting brand spanking
[3:58] new year of 2018 it's a fresh clean
[4:03] opportunity to do something for the
[4:05] kingdom of God and to make Jesus the
[4:08] Lord of your life
[4:09] I was recently speaking to you about
[4:11] making that transition from the Hebrew
[4:15] year 5777 to the Hebrew year 5778 which
[4:22] is 2018 on the Gregorian calendar both
[4:26] of the years ending in an eighth which
[4:29] is a number of new beginnings you might
[4:31] remember that we talked about in one of
[4:34] our times together that God was speaking
[4:36] specifically to us as we were making
[4:39] that transition into the new year that
[4:42] it wasn't going to be a year of just
[4:44] ordinary new beginnings where new things
[4:48] entirely new things are starting in our
[4:51] lives but it was also going to be a
[4:54] revisiting of some of the things that
[4:56] God had promised that he had sown maybe
[5:00] a vision a goal a desire a passion that
[5:03] you had to see something accomplished in
[5:05] the kingdom of God and it started out
[5:08] with a bang you saw God pouring water on
[5:11] it and it was being fertilized and it
[5:14] was growing and sprouting and then all
[5:16] of a sudden something happened
[5:18] maybe the enemy came against it in a
[5:20] great onslaught maybe you grew weary
[5:22] maybe you grew discouraged
[5:24] maybe the finances were cut off but
[5:27] something happened in that new beginning
[5:29] in your life it quickly faded away well
[5:33] I have good news for you
[5:34] I believe that 2018 is a year of the
[5:37] resurrection life of Jesus Christ and
[5:40] we're praying we're believing God not
[5:43] only for our ministry for the families
[5:46] that worship with us in Alabama and
[5:48] around the world but also you who are
[5:51] watching us on the gospel Channel we
[5:53] believe that God wants to do something
[5:56] in your life this year to resurrect old
[6:00] dreams old visions
[6:02] prophetic promises things that you've
[6:05] been holding on to things that you saw
[6:08] beginning to unfold and then all of a
[6:11] sudden for some reason cut off so I just
[6:14] decree and declare in the authority of
[6:17] Jesus Christ that if you will make him
[6:20] Lord of your life not just call him Lord
[6:23] but make him Lord and if you will
[6:26] continue to walk in his ways
[6:28] to surrender your heart to his word I
[6:31] want to remind you that serving God is
[6:34] not a lucky charm it's not some sort of
[6:37] you know like a lucky rabbit's foot or
[6:41] horseshoe over the door or whatever
[6:43] lucky traditions you might have in your
[6:46] area or in your culture serving God is
[6:50] so much different than that it's not
[6:52] something that we use only when we're in
[6:55] trouble
[6:55] serving the Lord is a day by day hour by
[6:59] hour relationship with the God of the
[7:02] universe
[7:02] imagine that and if we continue in that
[7:05] relationship if we let that relationship
[7:08] grow in 2018 then I believe we have
[7:11] every right to stand before the throne
[7:13] of God in prayer and believe for the
[7:17] resurrection life of Jesus Christ to be
[7:19] poured out on all of those beginnings
[7:23] that didn't go very far I believe this
[7:26] can be the year that they spring forth
[7:29] to accomplish everything that God
[7:32] desires to accomplish in your life and
[7:35] for you I know many of your burden for
[7:38] your family because things are getting
[7:40] really tight out there in the world
[7:43] there's a lot of anger there's a lot of
[7:46] resentment bitterness violence there's a
[7:49] lot of hatred maybe some of you have
[7:51] family members who get caught up in the
[7:54] in the sway of that kind of an of an
[7:57] attitude and a spirit and it begins to
[8:00] sort of take control of their lives and
[8:03] you've been very very concerned and very
[8:05] worried
[8:06] what about believing God with me that in
[8:09] 2018 there can be mighty deliverances in
[8:12] the lives of your family members I want
[8:15] to tell you that if you personally want
[8:17] to be an influence to your family to
[8:20] your neighbors it's not the preaching
[8:22] that you do with your mouth it's the
[8:24] preaching that you do with your life
[8:26] that's gonna make a difference this year
[8:28] people aren't really looking for more
[8:31] talk in this age of information they're
[8:34] looking for more walk they're looking
[8:36] for a people who want to live the life a
[8:39] different life in fact the Lord spoke to
[8:42] us as we were making that transition
[8:44] from 2017 into 2018 and he said choose
[8:49] the life tonight now choose the life
[8:53] that you're going to live in 2018 it can
[8:57] be the soulish life one that comes from
[9:00] the mind and the will and the emotions
[9:02] or it can be the Christ life the
[9:06] surrendered ascended life and I like
[9:09] something else that the Spirit of the
[9:10] Lord said the supernatural life a life
[9:15] where God works with us and through us
[9:18] in a way that is beyond natural
[9:21] explanation if I sat here and tried to
[9:23] explain to you the supernatural I would
[9:26] look like a bumbling nutcase because the
[9:29] supernatural cannot be explained
[9:32] it's just that super natural
[9:36] it actually supersedes the natural realm
[9:40] even the natural laws
[9:42] I've seen the power of God do in that
[9:46] realm what we could never accomplish by
[9:49] ourselves in the natural realm that's
[9:52] the kind of life that we want to live
[9:55] not just in 2018 but until the Lord
[9:59] comes for his people we want to be
[10:02] living that supernatural life
[10:04] it's a crazy life and when I say crazy I
[10:07] mean that in a good sense it's not it's
[10:10] not a life of insanity it's a life of
[10:14] excitement and a life of who knows
[10:17] what's coming next but if I'm trusting
[10:20] God and God is at the control tower it's
[10:23] going to be okay you may be crying one
[10:26] minute and jumping up and down with joy
[10:28] the next minute but that's the life of
[10:31] an ordinary Christian and when I say
[10:33] ordinary Christian I should say it's the
[10:35] ordinary life of a supernatural
[10:38] Christian because if we're just ordinary
[10:41] Christians hearing the words and
[10:44] confessing speaking the truth but not
[10:48] living the truth we're not going to see
[10:50] the supernatural life have you ever
[10:53] noticed how that two people can look at
[10:56] the same thing and describe it so
[10:58] entirely different I think we're all
[11:02] familiar with that proverbial expression
[11:06] is the glass half-empty or is the glass
[11:09] half-full if you're optimistic they say
[11:13] you'd be more likely to say if there's a
[11:16] half a glass of water in front of you
[11:19] you'd be more likely to say it's
[11:20] half-full but if you're pessimistic or
[11:23] negative and they say you'd have a
[11:25] tendency to say why it's half-empty two
[11:29] people looking at the same glass but
[11:31] describing it very very differently you
[11:34] know this is the way it is in our
[11:36] relationship with Jesus Christ because
[11:38] sometimes we're looking at things in the
[11:40] natural and in the natural Vey look
[11:43] bleak they look dark
[11:46] they look impossible but if we should
[11:49] choose to look with spirit eyes with his
[11:54] the eyes of God we would see it entirely
[11:59] different in fact I'm thinking of Joseph
[12:02] in the Bible when he had been betrayed
[12:04] by his brothers sold into slavery after
[12:08] being left for dead he ends up in the
[12:11] prison in Potiphar's house you know the
[12:14] story of Joseph finally he is exalted
[12:17] from the pit through the prison and
[12:20] finally from the prison to the palace
[12:23] and God begins to do amazing things in
[12:26] Joseph's life and finally because of a
[12:29] famine in the land God marches the
[12:32] Brothers of Joseph right down to Egypt
[12:35] and puts them right before his authority
[12:38] and when he realizes what's happening he
[12:42] says something so beautiful it's one of
[12:44] the reasons why when we study the
[12:46] scripture we see the life of Joseph as
[12:49] being a beautiful type of the life of
[12:52] Jesus Christ because Joseph looks at his
[12:56] brothers with forgiveness he hasn't
[12:59] forgotten what's happened but he's
[13:01] forgiven them it's evident by this
[13:03] statement what you meant to me for evil
[13:07] God meant to me for good when you read
[13:11] the story of Joseph and you hear how
[13:14] they were jealous of him because he had
[13:17] dreams he had supernatural spiritual
[13:20] experiences his brothers were jealous
[13:22] they resented him they told him to shut
[13:26] up quit talking all this spirit talk
[13:29] you're just trying to to woo our Father
[13:32] you just want to be the favorite when
[13:34] you read that your heart goes out to
[13:36] Joseph and then all the things that
[13:39] happen they put him in a pit they're
[13:41] gonna leave him for dead they they take
[13:43] that coat of many colors they dip it in
[13:46] the blood of an animal they take it back
[13:48] to his father and tell him that he's
[13:49] gone one of the brothers speaks up you
[13:52] know and they end up instead of leaving
[13:54] him to starve to death
[13:55] they sell him into slavery he's carried
[13:57] by Caravan Caravan to various parts of
[14:00] the world he ends up in Egypt of all
[14:03] places you
[14:04] that and your heart goes out to him then
[14:07] he's betrayed he refuses the advances of
[14:10] Potiphar's wife and therefore she lies
[14:14] about him he ends up in prison he
[14:17] interprets the dreams that the prisoners
[14:19] are having and one of those prisoners is
[14:22] exalted out of prison with the promise
[14:24] I'm going to to tell I'm gonna tell the
[14:28] authorities what's happened and and
[14:29] you're gonna be delivered out of here
[14:31] I'm gonna tell the whole story and they
[14:33] forget about him when you read this
[14:36] story your human heart your human
[14:38] compassion has to go out for Joseph he's
[14:41] really been through a lot when we look
[14:44] at that story we would say one knockdown
[14:48] after another one dark fiery trial after
[14:52] another
[14:53] there's no good to be seen in it with
[14:56] our natural eyes but I want you to know
[14:59] if you look at it with another set of
[15:01] eyes you'll see that one by one through
[15:04] every one of those trials God was
[15:07] refining the character of Joseph because
[15:11] he wanted to use him as a savior for his
[15:14] family and truly when we study the story
[15:17] we find out that it wasn't just his
[15:20] family that he was preserving but the
[15:23] entire household of Israel what a
[15:26] glorious true story in the Bible this
[15:31] isn't somebody's novel of fiction this
[15:34] is nonfiction I believe this with all of
[15:38] my heart I believe what I've read in
[15:40] God's Word about Joseph and in my mind
[15:43] I'm thinking at each little turn and
[15:45] twist in the road he's gonna be so
[15:47] bitter when this is over you know
[15:49] looking at it from a human standpoint
[15:51] and yet he refused to allow bitterness I
[15:56] just felt something in the spirit when I
[15:58] was speaking about bitterness and I want
[16:01] you to know that it is not entirely
[16:03] impossible that you and I as believers
[16:06] can yield to bitterness it's a
[16:09] temptation when we see wicked people
[16:13] prospering and the righteous people
[16:16] sometimes really
[16:17] suffering it can feel unfair we can
[16:22] misunderstand we can feel forsaken and
[16:25] all of those feelings of abandonment and
[16:28] rejection can start working themselves
[16:30] to the surface the next thing you know a
[16:33] root of bitterness can take a hold in
[16:35] your life and you begin to make excuses
[16:38] for your lack of discipleship for your
[16:41] lack of spiritual growth bitterness
[16:44] begins to to expand in your heart and
[16:47] become a stronghold you start blaming
[16:50] other people for where you are why you
[16:52] don't have what you what you what you
[16:55] need what you want what you wanted and
[16:57] looked for believed for you can turn all
[17:01] of those emotions toward people and the
[17:04] next thing you know you can lose your
[17:06] place in the spirit you can really go
[17:09] down in defeat so I want to say to you
[17:11] right now if you recognize that a root
[17:15] of bitterness has tried to take you out
[17:17] of this battle a root of bitterness has
[17:19] tried to disqualify you from being all
[17:22] that God has created you to be don't go
[17:24] another day don't go another hour with
[17:28] that root of bitterness recognize it you
[17:31] don't have to be condemned by it but
[17:33] recognize it and go to the one who has
[17:36] the surgical knife in his hand I'm
[17:38] telling you the Word of God can both
[17:41] comfort us and correct us it can soothe
[17:45] us and it can also operate on our lives
[17:48] with the precision of a surgeon's tool
[17:51] cutting out those things as we submit
[17:55] them to the Lord you know I think we
[17:57] live entirely too long with things like
[18:00] bitterness unforgiveness those feelings
[18:04] of rejection and I believe the reason
[18:06] why we choose to live with them so long
[18:08] it's because we're ashamed to bring them
[18:11] to the only one who can do something
[18:13] about it I think sometimes we try
[18:16] counseling we try talking to friends we
[18:19] try talking to family members sometimes
[18:21] we end up getting even more angry
[18:23] because they can't seem to understand
[18:26] what we're going through and so we keep
[18:29] it locked inside with
[18:30] again it's it has adverse effects on
[18:33] both our physical health and our
[18:35] spiritual health why don't we just bring
[18:38] them to the one who loves us the most
[18:40] the one who knew before the foundation
[18:43] of the world our strengths and our
[18:45] weaknesses why don't we just give them
[18:47] to the great surgeon of all surgeons and
[18:50] allow his word to come in and cut that
[18:53] root of bitterness out of our life I
[18:55] feel like I'm speaking to someone right
[18:58] now who's struggling in that area don't
[19:00] you be ashamed don't you let the enemy
[19:03] condemn you for that you just recognize
[19:06] let the Spirit of God turn the
[19:09] searchlight of his love onto that area
[19:12] of your soul right now let him expose it
[19:16] let him walk you through the the steps
[19:20] that led to the place where you are
[19:23] right now and let him show you another
[19:26] perspective instead of looking at the
[19:29] glass half-empty let God open your eyes
[19:33] to see it full okay half full but full
[19:38] of potential full of what God could
[19:41] eventually turn into abundance he can so
[19:46] fill your half filled cup until it's
[19:50] running over and the saucer is spilling
[19:53] over the excess no matter what you're in
[19:56] right now it's not forever it's not
[20:00] eternal it's shaping something in you if
[20:03] you are a true believer if you have
[20:07] surrendered your life to the word
[20:09] I didn't say a perfect Christian I just
[20:13] said fully surrendered and fully
[20:16] surrendering it's not something we do
[20:18] once and we never have to do it again
[20:20] we're fully surrendering daily to God's
[20:25] perspective to God's will Joseph could
[20:30] have so easily been disqualified he
[20:33] could have so easily failed in any of
[20:37] those many testings siftings that he
[20:41] went through but he was faithful to the
[20:44] and I'm glad that he was and I'm glad
[20:47] that like our Lord when he was on the
[20:50] cross our Lord looked at those who had
[20:54] wrongfully accused him who had lied and
[20:57] slandered his integrity so that they
[21:01] could crucify him thinking in their mind
[21:03] that if they killed him they could do
[21:07] away with the influence that he was
[21:10] having on the people his life was
[21:14] exposing what dry religion what dead dry
[21:20] theology can do in people's lives
[21:24] he was challenging those who were
[21:26] clinging to the written word while
[21:29] rejecting the reality of the Living Word
[21:32] and because of that they wanted to
[21:35] silence his voice they wanted to malign
[21:38] his character they just wanted to get
[21:40] rid of him he's hanging on the cross in
[21:43] agony that I cannot imagine in pain that
[21:47] I cannot begin to understand and he
[21:50] cries Father forgive them for they know
[21:54] not what they're doing like Joseph who
[21:58] said to his brothers you Memphis to me
[22:01] for evil but God meant it to me for good
[22:05] what if in 2018 we turn our faith around
[22:09] a little bit instead of wallowing around
[22:12] in self-pity we attach our faith to God
[22:16] and to his word and to his promise and
[22:18] we claim those new beginnings of old
[22:21] beginnings what if we really allow him
[22:25] to do what he has wanted to do in our
[22:28] lives ever since we started on this
[22:30] Christian journey if we could do that
[22:33] together if the people of God could
[22:36] realize that we get to choose the life
[22:39] we live in 2018 no there are
[22:42] circumstances that we don't get to
[22:44] choose there are situations around us
[22:47] that are out of our control but we do
[22:49] get to choose whether or not we're going
[22:51] to live it a life of hypocrisy a life of
[22:55] just soulish flesh
[22:57] desires or whether or not we're going to
[23:00] live it surrendered to the Spirit of God
[23:03] and to the Living Word who lives inside
[23:06] of us if we've welcomed him if we've
[23:09] allowed him to come in it's those who
[23:12] are doing everything in their power
[23:15] their strength which is often not enough
[23:18] but they're doing everything they can in
[23:21] their strength to be obedient to the
[23:23] example to the teachings the
[23:26] instructions of the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:29] and those truths that are contained for
[23:32] us in this word of God those are the
[23:35] ones who are going to be positioned in
[23:38] 2018 to live an ascended life when I say
[23:42] ascendant I don't mean in the terms of
[23:45] Eastern mysticism I mean in the upward
[23:48] life the upward call that spoken to us
[23:51] about that is spoken to us in the
[23:54] epistles we're different ones of the of
[23:58] the writers of the epistles both Paul
[24:00] and Peter and even John speak about this
[24:04] upward pull of the Spirit of God the
[24:08] ascended life the call of the Spirit
[24:11] that takes us above our circumstances
[24:14] above our aches and pains above our
[24:17] murmurings and complainings it takes us
[24:20] up into an entirely different
[24:22] perspective it's like this when we're
[24:25] when we're walking on the ground when
[24:27] we're walking saying it in a downtown
[24:29] area and we're looking at those tall
[24:32] buildings we're looking at things
[24:34] bye-bye our present perspective they
[24:38] look so massive those buildings look so
[24:40] tall but if you've ever flown over a
[24:43] metropolitan city in an airplane from
[24:46] that much higher vantage point
[24:49] everything looks entirely different
[24:51] those those skyscrapers of big cities
[24:55] they look like real match boxes those
[24:58] vehicles that are sometimes are taller
[25:01] than we are big SUVs taller than we are
[25:04] and yet from that vantage point of the
[25:07] airplane they look like tiny little
[25:09] ants moving around and certainly you
[25:12] can't even see the people once you you
[25:14] get so high the higher you get the more
[25:18] your perspective of things has changed
[25:20] the higher we allow the Spirit of God to
[25:23] lift us up by the revelation of his word
[25:27] in 2018 it's going to change the way we
[25:31] look at everything the higher we get the
[25:35] smaller our problems the smaller our
[25:37] circumstances will begin to look and the
[25:40] bigger our God will become in our lives
[25:44] one of the great greats one of the great
[25:47] Giants of the faith one time said we
[25:51] must not look at the bigness of our
[25:54] problems we must choose to look at the
[25:57] bigness of our God and truly indeed he
[26:01] is big he is larger than large he is
[26:05] more capable than we can even imagine he
[26:09] not only created the world but he keeps
[26:12] everything moving in its rhythm I know
[26:16] sometimes we doubt that when we see what
[26:18] evil is doing and what men are doing by
[26:21] their wicked imagination but don't you
[26:24] be fooled by the hour we're living in
[26:26] God is still sovereign he is still
[26:29] supreme and he is bringing the people
[26:31] into his life into his character as the
[26:35] Apostle Paul described it Christ in you
[26:39] his life his truth his Spirit being
[26:44] formed inside of us until we began to
[26:48] think his thoughts put you on the mind
[26:51] of Christ
[26:52] we began to do the works that Jesus
[26:55] would do if he were standing on this
[26:58] earth in a physical body today
[27:01] remember the Gospels remember the
[27:04] promise that Jesus left us will you say
[27:06] he left that to his earthly disciples
[27:09] his contemporaries those who were living
[27:11] with him in that hour know he left that
[27:14] to all of his disciples of which I am
[27:17] one and I trust that you are one
[27:20] who studies the truth of God's Word and
[27:23] depends on the Spirit of the Lord to
[27:26] make that word alive in you your life is
[27:29] being shaped by the word discipled
[27:32] disciplined by the Word of God if that's
[27:35] the case you're just as much as a
[27:37] disciple of Jesus Christ as was Peter as
[27:41] was John Matthew or any of the original
[27:44] 12 and if Jesus made a promise to them
[27:48] greater works than this shall you do
[27:51] because I go to my father I claim that
[27:54] promise I believe by the power of the
[27:57] Holy Ghost but the modern disciples of
[28:01] Jesus Christ the present-day disciples
[28:05] of Jesus Christ have the same power the
[28:08] same Authority the same God to work
[28:11] through them to work through their lives
[28:15] today as he did nearly 2,000 years ago
[28:18] well I don't see a lot of that going on
[28:21] you're no brother Shelly I don't see a
[28:24] lot of that happening well I want you to
[28:26] know the best is yet to come
[28:28] I want you to know that God is helping
[28:30] us to get position by the things that we
[28:33] go through and the harvest that we have
[28:36] prayed for is upon us don't you believe
[28:39] the lie of the enemy and choose to see
[28:42] things God's way instead of the way that
[28:47] maybe someone living the life of
[28:50] hypocrisy would see them or the one
[28:52] who's living that negative life would
[28:54] see them let me give you an example of
[28:57] how things can similar things can be
[29:00] viewed in many many different ways
[29:03] depending on where someone is in their
[29:06] thinking
[29:07] depending on where someone is in their
[29:09] spiritual journey
[29:10] at any given time in Matthew chapter 26
[29:14] and indeed all of the four Gospels there
[29:18] is a story and I'd like to read a
[29:20] portion of it to you in Matthew 26
[29:23] beginning in verse 6 now when Jesus was
[29:27] in Bethany in the house of Simon the
[29:29] leper there came unto him a woman have
[29:32] an alabaster box of very precious
[29:35] ointment and poured it on his head as he
[29:39] sat at meat but when his disciples saw
[29:42] it they had indignation this is anger
[29:46] and wrath saying to what purpose is this
[29:50] waste for this ointment might have been
[29:54] sold for much and given to the poor when
[29:57] Jesus understood it he said unto them
[30:00] why trouble ye the woman for she hath
[30:03] wrought a good work upon me for ye have
[30:07] the poor always with you but me ye have
[30:11] not always for in that she poured this
[30:14] ointment on my body she did it for my
[30:18] burial verily I say unto you wheresoever
[30:21] this gospel is preached in the whole
[30:23] world
[30:24] there shall also this that this woman
[30:28] hath done be told for a memorial of her
[30:32] hey you and I are fulfilling Scripture
[30:35] right now you're watching maybe you're
[30:38] sitting in your living room watching
[30:40] Christian television I'm sitting in our
[30:44] studio in Alabama the United States and
[30:47] both of us we're fulfilling Scripture
[30:49] the very words of Jesus because he said
[30:52] wherever this gospel shall go what this
[30:55] woman has done will be a memorial unto
[30:58] her it will be remembered to her for
[31:02] generations to come
[31:04] and indeed we're remembering what she
[31:07] did the disciples looked at this
[31:10] ointment that was poured on the body of
[31:12] the Lord and because of where they were
[31:15] at the time maybe there were bills about
[31:17] to come do maybe they you know really
[31:21] weren't caring about the poor at all who
[31:24] knows what was in their mind but what we
[31:27] do know is what they were walking
[31:29] through at the moment or what they were
[31:31] thinking what their thought process was
[31:34] at the moment deeply affected their
[31:37] discernment it deeply affected their
[31:40] judgment and they among themselves began
[31:44] to murmur
[31:45] the indignation the Bible said what a
[31:48] waste what a waste of money this
[31:53] ointment could have been sold the money
[31:56] the value given to the poor but Jesus he
[32:01] knew the rest of the story he knew the
[32:04] end and he didn't call it a waste rather
[32:08] but a memorial a good work for this
[32:11] precious woman who had been forgiven
[32:14] much we believe and therefore she loved
[32:17] much there is some controversy among
[32:21] theologians as this story is told in
[32:24] Matthew Mark Luke and John is there one
[32:28] woman did this happen one time or did it
[32:32] happen
[32:32] two times and they don't always agree
[32:35] because in one of the Gospels it says
[32:38] that she washed his feet with her tears
[32:42] and dried them with her hair it's
[32:46] possible that this is two different
[32:48] women or perhaps one woman but the truth
[32:52] remains in each of the gospel tellings
[32:57] someone misunderstood it
[32:59] someone judged it wrongly someone called
[33:04] it a waste in Jesus discerned what they
[33:08] were saying and he corrected them
[33:11] quickly and explained to them there was
[33:14] an entirely different way of looking at
[33:17] this circumstance I just wanted I want
[33:21] to do that for you today I want to tell
[33:23] you that the pain of the moment the
[33:27] confusion of your circumstances right
[33:30] now can cause you to look at things in
[33:33] your life what a waste it can cause you
[33:37] to say nothing good could ever come out
[33:40] of that it could even cause you to
[33:43] believe that God has forsaken you or
[33:45] abandoned you you've failed him so many
[33:49] times he's given up on you I don't know
[33:52] how you're feeling right now but I can
[33:54] tell you this
[33:55] it's so amazing to me how one thought
[33:58] process early in the morning can affect
[34:01] the rest of my day if I start my day in
[34:05] prayer if I start my day in praise and
[34:08] in worship and glorifying God as I did
[34:12] this morning it makes an entirely
[34:14] different day for me do bad things still
[34:18] happen sometime do I get under stress
[34:22] before the day is over sometime do I get
[34:25] bad news sometime
[34:28] but the truth is my frame of mind is
[34:32] adjusted by connecting with my father
[34:35] first thing in the morning if you missed
[34:38] your chance this morning
[34:40] do it now connect with him now if you
[34:43] find yourself getting off course during
[34:45] the day bring your thoughts into
[34:48] submission to God's precious word for
[34:53] your life the Bible says that he has
[34:55] good thoughts towards you he wants to
[34:58] bless you and prosper you not curse you
[35:01] but he's bound to his word his blessings
[35:06] are not to be poured out upon every
[35:09] person on the planet his blessings are
[35:12] often reserved for those who are willing
[35:15] to make that decision to walk in his
[35:18] truths to surrender to his precious word
[35:22] folks this is not a just a dusty history
[35:27] book this is the written record of who
[35:31] God is not just who he was but who he is
[35:36] you say how is that possible brother
[35:39] Shelly because every name mentioned in
[35:41] this book they've been dead for nearly
[35:44] 2,000 years but I want you to know that
[35:47] the scriptures are clear this word was
[35:50] preserved for us not just so we would
[35:54] know who God was but so that we could
[35:58] know who God is there's something you
[36:01] need to know about religion and that is
[36:03] religion can get way off course
[36:08] denominational
[36:09] Christianity can get way off course when
[36:13] we start mixing God's truths with man's
[36:17] interpretation with man's ideas we get a
[36:21] mixture that can often take you so far
[36:24] away from God that the God you're
[36:28] serving in your mind is not the God of
[36:31] the Bible at all I don't think
[36:34] necessarily that religion has plotted
[36:38] this or religious people have have
[36:40] plotted this in their minds to do this
[36:43] to people on the planet but what I
[36:47] believe is that the enemy has taken full
[36:49] advantage of the thought processes of
[36:53] men and I just encourage you as we're
[36:56] entering into this new fresh year
[36:59] examine your processes of thought
[37:03] examine what the enemy is saying how do
[37:05] you know how do you know the enemy is
[37:07] talking to me
[37:08] because I know the enemy I know the
[37:11] enemy I've watched him long enough I've
[37:14] studied the way he operates long enough
[37:17] and I've experienced his attacks long
[37:19] enough that I know that if there's even
[37:22] the smallest desire in your heart to
[37:25] serve the Living God I know the enemy's
[37:29] lying to you I know that he's got
[37:31] another lie
[37:32] preparing right now to feed you at the
[37:36] moment that you're already broken or
[37:39] vulnerable I know that he will feed you
[37:42] with a spoon one lie after another
[37:45] until you become so discouraged or so
[37:48] bitter that you give up on serving the
[37:50] Lord altogether I beg you I implore you
[37:55] in the name of Jesus Christ don't allow
[37:59] the devil to win in your life people are
[38:03] counting on you your lost family members
[38:06] are counting on you some of your saved
[38:08] family members are counting on you to be
[38:12] strong
[38:13] to stand on God's Word defeat the enemy
[38:16] you see ultimately Jesus defeated the
[38:19] enemy at the cross and that
[38:23] defeat was sealed signed sealed and
[38:27] delivered on Resurrection Day when Jesus
[38:31] conquered death hell and the grave and
[38:34] he rose from the dead
[38:37] victorious triumphant over every trick
[38:41] the enemy tried to stop the influence of
[38:44] his life there's virtue in the life of
[38:48] Jesus Christ that's available to the
[38:51] believer today
[38:53] examine some of the things that you've
[38:55] been looking at it you're in your life
[38:58] see if you're looking at them from
[39:00] Earth's perspective or if you're
[39:03] struggling to look at them from God's
[39:05] perspective get above the scene here's a
[39:10] woman in some of the Gospels the woman
[39:13] is described as a woman without good
[39:16] reputation
[39:17] she made this money perhaps in very
[39:20] questionable ways get up above the scene
[39:23] looked down at this woman look at this
[39:25] precious alabaster box at least a couple
[39:29] hundred dollars of value at that time it
[39:31] would be of great value today see this
[39:36] moment see the Pharisee who invited
[39:40] Jesus into his home and then allowed him
[39:43] to sit in the corner without any
[39:44] ointment for his feet for his head
[39:47] without a proper welcome
[39:49] without proper salutation he's sitting
[39:53] in the corner invited but unwelcomed
[39:56] unfortunately that's the condition of
[39:59] many churches around the world today
[40:01] invited in because his name is on the
[40:04] door but he sits if he indeed comes he
[40:08] sits in the corner with no one to kiss
[40:11] his face to welcome him no one to wash
[40:14] his feet no one to anoint his head as
[40:17] was the custom of his earthly life the
[40:21] time that he lived what a shame what a
[40:25] shame that the book of Revelation tells
[40:27] us that in the last church age our Lord
[40:31] Jesus is standing on the outside of his
[40:34] own church
[40:35] knocking on the door we often use this
[40:38] analogy to refer to Jesus knocking on
[40:41] the door of our heart to come in with
[40:44] salvation but the context of the
[40:46] scripture is that Jesus is knocking on
[40:49] the door of the church if you will open
[40:52] the door I will come in unto you I will
[40:56] sup with you I will sit at meet with you
[40:59] we will fellowship together we will have
[41:03] relationship together we will become one
[41:06] as we have spoken about before and yet
[41:10] the church can be so busy with her
[41:13] programs so busy with her doing good
[41:16] that she misses her opportunity to walk
[41:20] every day in union in relationship with
[41:23] Jesus Christ but I tell you in the name
[41:26] of the Lord around the world in every
[41:28] nation there's a bride that's being
[41:30] identified in this hour God is calling
[41:33] to her a deep calling in the in the deep
[41:37] the deep calling to the deep you're
[41:41] becoming so dissatisfied with religion
[41:45] as it is Church as usual that you're
[41:51] calling out for more of God in fact
[41:54] somebody is watching this program right
[41:56] now and your exact words have often been
[41:59] there's got to be more than this there
[42:02] has to be more than this and I'm telling
[42:05] you in his precious name right here on
[42:09] the gospel channel there is more than
[42:13] ordinary Christianity there is more than
[42:17] just knowing him by name and not by life
[42:21] there is more you've just got to come up
[42:24] a little bit above the circumstance and
[42:26] look down and see it with a different
[42:29] perspective what you meant to me you
[42:33] brothers as Joseph was looking at them
[42:36] you deceived our Father you betrayed me
[42:40] you would have left me for dead sold me
[42:43] into slavery all of these things they're
[42:46] in his mind he hasn't
[42:47] forgotten them you minute to me for evil
[42:50] oh but look where we are today the scene
[42:54] has been reversed our positions have
[42:56] been reversed
[42:57] I'm no longer the one vulnerable I'm no
[42:59] longer the one depending on you for my
[43:02] life he must have been thinking now
[43:04] you're depending on me for your life you
[43:08] meant it to me for evil but God meant it
[43:10] to me for good oh this excites me I have
[43:14] to be honest this thrills me this
[43:17] encourages me to look at my
[43:19] circumstances differently than I've been
[43:21] looking at them even in the past and
[43:24] it's easy it's easy to look at one set
[43:27] of circumstances from Heaven's
[43:28] perspective and then another set of
[43:31] circumstances in your life from Earth's
[43:33] perspective from the perspective of the
[43:36] mind and the will and the emotions so
[43:39] we've got to bring ourselves together so
[43:41] to speak we've got to come into
[43:43] agreement how are we going to look at
[43:45] our circumstances this year how are we
[43:48] going to live our lives are we going to
[43:51] choose to make the effort I'm telling
[43:53] you it's not automatic it doesn't fall
[43:56] on you you're going to have to choose
[43:59] and you're gonna have to reinforce that
[44:01] choice by continuing to choose I want
[44:06] the Christ's life I want the virtue of
[44:10] Jesus Christ to live in my body to give
[44:15] me strength to give me power to live
[44:18] above sin to live above unbelief and to
[44:22] point people to the only truth that can
[44:24] transform and that's the gospel the
[44:27] revelation of Jesus Christ it's amazing
[44:32] to me how the enemy is moving not in the
[44:36] world but in the in the minds of
[44:38] Christians how he so desires to cause
[44:41] you and I to live way below our means
[44:45] but it's time for a redo it's time to
[44:48] start over that's the one thing that I'd
[44:51] like to say to you today about serving
[44:53] God if you fail you don't lay there in
[44:57] your failure wallowing around in
[44:59] self-pity you've got to rise up you've
[45:03] got to let God be God again in your life
[45:07] let him move in your family again let
[45:10] him move in your church again
[45:12] don't be critical by what you see decide
[45:16] that with God's help you'll be an agent
[45:19] of change for those around you I believe
[45:23] that God's giving us an opportunity to
[45:25] take sides with his word in 2018 I
[45:29] choose to believe God's infallible word
[45:34] I choose to believe that the Living Word
[45:38] of God the spirit of Jesus Christ is
[45:41] living inside of me I choose to believe
[45:45] that no matter what's going on in the
[45:47] earthly and carnal governments of this
[45:50] world I choose to believe that God wants
[45:53] to give his people governmental
[45:55] authority in the spirit I believe that
[45:58] the bride of Jesus Christ in the earth
[46:01] has a very important role to play in
[46:05] standing in the gap we call it in
[46:08] intercessory prayer in moving forward to
[46:12] know the mind of God in the will of God
[46:14] and the desires of God before they
[46:17] become perhaps plain to those around us
[46:21] he's looking for forerunners he's
[46:24] looking for those who will give
[46:26] everything every part of their life to
[46:29] him surrender every bit of it to him and
[46:33] then watch him take those pieces even
[46:37] the broken pieces of our life and mend
[46:40] them put them back together for greater
[46:43] purposes I know that you may be
[46:46] discouraged I know that you may have
[46:49] been at the point of giving up at many
[46:52] times in your life I tell you I've been
[46:55] there I've been serving the Lord since I
[46:58] was 7 years old when he baptized me with
[47:01] the Holy Ghost and fire I've given in my
[47:04] entire life I've had some gains and I've
[47:07] had some losses I've had some successes
[47:10] and I've had
[47:11] some failures but I just want to give
[47:13] you this testimony he is still Lord he
[47:17] is still good he is still real he is
[47:20] still faithful and he's as dear to you
[47:23] right now as you will allow him to be
[47:26] our lives get crowded especially in the
[47:30] time we're living in now technology has
[47:33] a way of filling up our lives problems
[47:36] seek to consume us but if you make some
[47:40] room for Jesus Christ today if you make
[47:43] some room for the presence of the Lord
[47:46] he'll come you invite him you make room
[47:50] for him when he comes wash his feet with
[47:54] your tears pour your heart of love upon
[47:58] him tell him you're so glad that he came
[48:01] don't leave him in the corner with dirty
[48:04] feet look at things from a higher
[48:08] vantage point in this hour there's
[48:11] authority that God wants to release in
[48:14] your life to speak words of truth that
[48:19] not that they don't fall on deaf ears
[48:22] they accomplish things in the realm of
[48:25] the Spirit whether we immediately see
[48:28] results in the natural or not things are
[48:31] shifted in the spirit realm I believe
[48:34] that what this little woman did that day
[48:37] shifted some things in the spirit realm
[48:40] I believe it gave the disciples an
[48:43] opportunity to get a good look at their
[48:47] heart
[48:47] I wonder how embarrassed they felt when
[48:50] Jesus discerning what they were
[48:53] murmuring about spoke to them and what
[48:56] he had to say was very different from
[48:59] how they had discerned the scene that
[49:02] had just unfolded I wonder how
[49:05] embarrassed we would feel right now if
[49:07] we indeed found out that God is looking
[49:11] at what's happening in our life right
[49:13] now from a very different point of view
[49:17] than the one we've been looking at it
[49:20] with I said a moment ago let this be a
[49:23] year of of the reduce of doing it over
[49:27] recently when we were talking together I
[49:30] named I read a ton of of words with the
[49:36] prefix REE to do again to restart to
[49:40] rebuild to recover to refresh to realign
[49:43] I just prophesied to you right now that
[49:47] if you will surrender your heart again
[49:49] to God if you will surrender your
[49:51] thoughts again to God if you will refuse
[49:55] to continue to think the thoughts that
[49:59] the enemy is feeding you with a spoon
[50:01] how do I know
[50:02] are they contrary to God's Word if if
[50:06] you're if in your inner being you have
[50:10] decided that you'll never be able to
[50:13] accomplish anything for God that he's
[50:15] through with you that he's forgotten you
[50:17] that he's I tell you that's a lie that's
[50:19] how you can know because that's not what
[50:21] God's Word said God's Word very
[50:24] generally speaks I mean it's speaking to
[50:27] a lot of people because we don't know
[50:29] who's gonna read the scripture but but
[50:31] the word of the Lord says I've got good
[50:33] plans I've got good thoughts about you I
[50:36] want to do things in your life I tell
[50:39] you I believe in divine appointments I
[50:41] know that that sometimes people are just
[50:45] you know they get sore in their thumb
[50:47] they get tendinitis in their thumb
[50:50] because they're just sitting in front of
[50:52] the television with the remote control
[50:54] just switching switching switching
[50:55] switching sports on what 300 channels
[51:02] reality television that's not reality
[51:05] you know soap operas that we sometimes
[51:08] call slop operas there's so much to see
[51:12] there's so much entertainment out there
[51:15] and some of it vulgar and filthy even
[51:18] some of Christian television is not
[51:20] exactly presenting the gospel of Jesus
[51:22] Christ but I happen to believe that God
[51:25] makes divine appointments with people I
[51:27] happen to believe that you may think
[51:30] you're in control of the remote and you
[51:33] may
[51:33] find out one day that God is in control
[51:36] that he brought you to this moment right
[51:39] now that you're sitting in front of this
[51:42] television or in front of your computer
[51:45] watching this program right now because
[51:48] it's you that the Spirit of God is
[51:51] reaching for right now it's you that God
[51:54] wants to restore and bring into
[51:56] realignment perhaps it's you that God
[51:59] wants to give you a new beginning in
[52:01] 2018
[52:03] then quit disqualifying yourself and
[52:05] allow God to be God in your life make up
[52:09] your mind that you're not going to just
[52:11] call him Lord you're gonna make him Lord
[52:13] you're going to serve Him you're going
[52:16] to reject the life of oppression and
[52:18] hopelessness and you're going to receive
[52:20] that supernatural life that we talked
[52:23] about yes angels are real yes demons are
[52:27] real
[52:27] yes principalities and powers and
[52:30] spiritual wickedness in high places
[52:32] it's real the presence of God in
[52:35] someone's life it's real there is a
[52:38] supernatural life there is a greater and
[52:42] a higher life than just everyday natural
[52:46] living I don't know how some people make
[52:50] it with all of the circumstances they
[52:52] have to go through in life with all the
[52:55] addictions and all of the oppression and
[52:58] bondage that some people are living with
[53:00] I don't know how they survive in fact
[53:03] I'll just be honest if you don't have
[53:05] Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior I
[53:09] don't know how you get out of bed every
[53:11] morning
[53:11] but I've got good news for you he wants
[53:14] to be your Lord he wants to be your
[53:17] Savior he wants to be your encourage err
[53:20] I don't know what your position is right
[53:22] now I don't know you by name I don't
[53:25] know your street address but I know the
[53:27] one who does I know the one who has
[53:29] those divine appointments and and who
[53:32] knows how to make those connections
[53:34] I just want to prophesy to somebody
[53:38] right now that means proclaim the truth
[53:40] I just want to proclaim the truth to
[53:42] somebody right now that God
[53:44] ABB's
[53:45] solutely has the power the ability the
[53:48] desire and the will to bring some of
[53:51] those seeds that have been planted in
[53:54] your life through the years that have
[53:55] never come to full harvest he has the
[53:58] ability the power to bring those things
[54:02] up out of the ground
[54:04] not just sprouting but flourishing this
[54:07] year if you can reconnect yourself with
[54:10] the vision maybe something you gave up
[54:13] on a long time ago I don't know what it
[54:15] was I don't know what kind of ministry
[54:18] it was that God was calling you to I
[54:20] don't know what kind of desire maybe
[54:21] there were simple desire maybe you just
[54:23] wanted a good companion in life you
[54:26] wanted to raise your children to serve
[54:27] God to love the Lord and to point people
[54:31] to the work of the Cross and things got
[54:34] really messed up in a hurry well I want
[54:37] you to know that God knows how to bring
[54:39] those things to pass in your life even
[54:43] now sometimes we make dreams and we make
[54:46] plans for our life and they don't always
[54:48] come together but if we can discover
[54:51] God's dreams what does God dream for me
[54:54] what what is his desire for me in this
[54:57] hour
