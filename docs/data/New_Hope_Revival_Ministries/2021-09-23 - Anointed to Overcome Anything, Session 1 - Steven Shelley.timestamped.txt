[59:58] because ye have known him
[1:00:01] that is from the beginning
[1:00:03] i write unto you young men because you
[1:00:06] have overcome the wicked one
[1:00:08] i write unto you little children because
[1:00:11] ye have known the father the next verse
[1:00:16] i have written unto you fathers
[1:00:18] because you have known
[1:00:21] that is from him you have known him that
[1:00:24] is from the beginning
[1:00:25] i have written unto you young men
[1:00:27] because you're strong and the word of
[1:00:30] god abideth in you
[1:00:32] and ye have overcome
[1:00:34] the wicked one that seems to be a repeat
[1:00:37] there doesn't it
[1:00:38] love
[1:00:39] not the world
[1:00:42] neither the things that are in the world
[1:00:45] if any man love the world the love of
[1:00:48] the father is not in him
[1:00:51] can you say amen
[1:00:53] for all that is in the world the lust of
[1:00:55] the flesh
[1:00:56] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[1:00:58] life is not of the father but it is of
[1:01:02] the world
[1:01:03] and the world passeth away
[1:01:05] and the last the lust thereof but he
[1:01:09] that doeth the will of god abideth
[1:01:12] forever do you believe that one more
[1:01:14] verse little children it is the last
[1:01:17] time
[1:01:18] and as ye have heard that antichrist
[1:01:20] shall come
[1:01:21] even now are there many antichrists
[1:01:25] whereby we know
[1:01:27] that it is the last time
[1:01:31] i don't have any doubt that
[1:01:33] the apostle believed that he was living
[1:01:36] in the very last of the last days
[1:01:40] how much more can we say about ourselves
[1:01:43] we are living in the latest hour the
[1:01:46] last of the last days and the grace that
[1:01:49] was shown to them that they might
[1:01:51] overcome is the same grace that god is
[1:01:53] extending to you and i if you believe
[1:01:55] that same man
[1:01:56] bow your head just a moment father
[1:01:59] how we thank you tonight for this
[1:02:01] service already for everyone that has
[1:02:03] gathered here in your name

[1:02:17] flow of your word let it come forth

[1:02:23] forth to do let it break every yoke
[1:02:27] let it silence every demonic power
[1:02:30] let your word come and liberate your
[1:02:32] people that we might know that freedom
[1:02:35] that we sung about tonight
[1:02:37] we know it's not an emotion it's not a
[1:02:39] feeling but freedom is like resurrection
[1:02:42] it's a person
[1:02:44] that's the fullness of you lord our lord
[1:02:46] jesus christ help us tonight bless those
[1:02:50] who are yet to travel this way let
[1:02:53] angels line the highways bless these
[1:02:56] precious ones who'll be going back to

[1:03:01] their safety
[1:03:02] all the way we ask it in the name above
[1:03:05] every name the name of our lord jesus
[1:03:08] christ and the saints said
[1:03:10] you may be seated this evening help me
[1:03:12] preach would you then i can hurry up
[1:03:15] i want to speak tonight on
[1:03:17] how to overcome
[1:03:20] anything
[1:03:22] that's a broad subject isn't anything
[1:03:25] you you say
[1:03:26] brother shelly anything yes
[1:03:29] anything
[1:03:30] i'm going to take god at his word
[1:03:32] tonight
[1:03:33] i'm going to believe that if he said i
[1:03:36] have overcome the world and you can too
[1:03:39] then i'm going to believe that
[1:03:40] everything that's in this life that
[1:03:42] troubles you hinders you
[1:03:44] impedes your growth in any way that
[1:03:47] there is an answer there is a remedy
[1:03:49] there is an anointing there is a
[1:03:51] deliverance so that you might come over
[1:03:54] it
[1:03:54] so that it will no longer be a barrier
[1:03:57] in your life how many of you have ever
[1:03:59] had barriers
[1:04:00] well we all have had barriers and some
[1:04:02] of us are sitting here this evening and
[1:04:04] our life is hemmed in
[1:04:07] it looks like that we are we turn to the
[1:04:09] left and there is uh all the mountains
[1:04:13] we turn to the right like the children
[1:04:14] of israel they're the mountains we look
[1:04:17] behind us and it's pharaoh's army
[1:04:19] approaching from the rear we look ahead
[1:04:21] and we see the red sea in front of us
[1:04:24] and we say lord i'm hemmed in i'm
[1:04:26] hindered on every side what will i do
[1:04:30] but the answer is the same today as it
[1:04:33] was then
[1:04:34] moses got a word of unction from the
[1:04:37] lord help me and he said stand still
[1:04:41] [Applause]
[1:04:43] get your eyes off those mountains get
[1:04:45] your eyes off those boulders get your
[1:04:48] eyes off of your enemy don't you look at
[1:04:51] that red sea in front of you stand
[1:04:54] still
[1:04:55] and see the salvation of the lord
[1:05:00] and that great pillar of fire it came
[1:05:02] swirling down from eternity didn't it
[1:05:05] and divided the red sea
[1:05:08] and uh i never talk about that never
[1:05:11] mention the red sea without thinking
[1:05:13] about that little granny can i tell it
[1:05:15] one more time
[1:05:17] the the you know a new a new graduate of
[1:05:20] some bible cemetery somewhere was in the
[1:05:23] pulpit preaching and he felt it
[1:05:26] necessary to explain away all the
[1:05:29] supernatural powers of god
[1:05:31] and if there was a miracle mentioned he
[1:05:34] had a natural explanation
[1:05:36] for every miracle
[1:05:38] and this one old granny
[1:05:40] i have i have a few grannies around here
[1:05:42] that be just like this
[1:05:44] you don't have to call any names
[1:05:46] but you know i got a few that'd be just
[1:05:48] like this
[1:05:49] this little granny heard it till she
[1:05:51] couldn't take it no more
[1:05:52] she she knew that you know this is the
[1:05:55] new way and he's not going nowhere but i
[1:05:57] don't have to just sit back and be quiet
[1:05:59] i can say something about it and so he
[1:06:01] said well don't you all know that this
[1:06:04] time of the year the red sea said i
[1:06:06] don't really mean red sea it's the reed
[1:06:08] see it's a sea of reeds and he said it's
[1:06:11] only
[1:06:12] about ankle just a little bit higher
[1:06:14] than ankle deep
[1:06:16] and so he said yes it was a wonderful
[1:06:19] thing that happened but not quite the
[1:06:21] miracle that we have always perceived it
[1:06:24] was because basically they walked across
[1:06:28] in ankle deep water how many of you know
[1:06:30] better than that
[1:06:32] and that little granny got so excited
[1:06:35] she jumped up and she began to shout and
[1:06:38] praise the lord look what he did look
[1:06:40] what he did look what he did
[1:06:42] the pastor he got real agitated with her
[1:06:46] and he said little sister yes the lord
[1:06:47] is good but did you hear how i just
[1:06:50] explained to you that that wasn't quite
[1:06:53] the supernatural miracle that we'd
[1:06:54] always thought it was
[1:06:56] that in fact they were just passing
[1:06:58] through a little bit of ankle not even
[1:07:00] to the knees
[1:07:01] of water and so that millions of people
[1:07:04] that came through there well that was
[1:07:06] some she just started shouting again
[1:07:09] hallelujah yes i heard you praise the
[1:07:11] lord look what he did look what he did
[1:07:14] and she said pastor
[1:07:16] she said i want you to think about this
[1:07:19] okay maybe it wasn't a great
[1:07:21] supernatural miracle like we always
[1:07:24] thought that they crossed in water that
[1:07:26] was way up over their heads but she said
[1:07:28] my what kind of a god did it take to
[1:07:32] drown pharaoh's army
[1:07:35] all of his soldiers all of his horses
[1:07:39] turned over all of his chariots she said
[1:07:41] look what god has done
[1:07:44] she found a way to give him praise
[1:07:46] didn't you
[1:07:49] and that is the truth there are some
[1:07:51] things you can't explain away
[1:07:54] i don't care how deep the water was
[1:07:56] i know the pillar of fire came down and
[1:07:59] the job was taken care of so it really
[1:08:02] doesn't matter how deep your stuff is
[1:08:04] it doesn't really matter how big your
[1:08:06] obstacle is it doesn't really matter
[1:08:08] what's standing in your way there is a
[1:08:11] way to overcome anything
[1:08:14] and if you want to take it a little
[1:08:16] further you can say there's a way to
[1:08:17] overcome everything
[1:08:20] nothing should stand in our way as
[1:08:24] children of the most high god i might
[1:08:26] just pau i might just
[1:08:29] it is nothing but the truth do we have
[1:08:32] troubles oh yes i don't think i'm
[1:08:34] denying that do we have problems
[1:08:37] sure we do do things hinder us on the
[1:08:39] way
[1:08:41] just about every day
[1:08:45] if you get through a whole day without a
[1:08:47] hindrance of some kind you must be
[1:08:49] living under a rock somewhere
[1:08:51] because if i have to move about where
[1:08:53] people are
[1:08:56] if i happen to catch the news
[1:08:59] if i happen to hear people talking in
[1:09:01] the store somewhere like sister sharon
[1:09:03] requested prayer tonight for fear there
[1:09:05] will be a hindrance on every side
[1:09:08] and i found out that some of us have
[1:09:10] gotten so good at it if we don't have
[1:09:12] enough hindering us today we reach way
[1:09:16] back
[1:09:18] and we'll preach a minute
[1:09:20] we reach way
[1:09:21] back to something that we dealt with
[1:09:24] years and years ago and we choose to
[1:09:27] remain hindered by something that we've
[1:09:30] already walked through
[1:09:33] did you make it
[1:09:35] okay if it was ten years ago did you
[1:09:37] make it did you press through did you
[1:09:39] overcome somehow are you still alive
[1:09:42] have you still been hearing from the
[1:09:44] lord is the king still talking to you if
[1:09:48] he is there's no reason to reach back
[1:09:51] and grab a hold of what god has already
[1:09:53] given you the victory over somebody said
[1:09:55] but i don't feel the victory i want to
[1:09:57] tell you what i what i told the class
[1:09:59] today was my last uh session i've been
[1:10:03] doing a class in in england in europe uh
[1:10:06] every wednesday by zoom at two o'clock
[1:10:10] uh and it's just been a wonderful
[1:10:12] experience for me and before we were
[1:10:15] getting the zoom set up uh the host just
[1:10:18] said uh stephen i know you sound a
[1:10:21] little star how are you feeling and and
[1:10:24] normally i would have probably said well
[1:10:26] better than i was yesterday or something
[1:10:28] along that line but i said what does
[1:10:31] feelings have to do with it
[1:10:34] and they she just laughed i'm telling
[1:10:36] you she said that is exactly right and
[1:10:40] that's why we stay in the stuff that god
[1:10:43] has already brought us out because we
[1:10:45] have feelings and memories and
[1:10:48] affections and reasonings that are
[1:10:50] attached to it but i want you to know
[1:10:53] tonight i'm not going to tell you
[1:10:54] anything you don't already know i'm
[1:10:56] setting the theme i'm just establishing
[1:11:00] what we are looking to receive from the
[1:11:03] lord this week a reminder that there is
[1:11:07] nothing no nothing that we cannot make
[1:11:10] our way through or over or under or
[1:11:13] around or however it is that god wants
[1:11:16] to get us through it if he brought you
[1:11:19] to it
[1:11:21] he's obligated himself to bring you
[1:11:23] through it
[1:11:24] can you say amen
[1:11:26] talk to your stuff
[1:11:28] talk to it they say you you didn't come
[1:11:30] to stay
[1:11:32] nothing in my life come to stay except
[1:11:34] jesus
[1:11:36] everything else just passes through
[1:11:38] but jesus has come to stay
[1:11:41] hallelujah and we know that there's
[1:11:43] great victory when we place our faith in
[1:11:46] god's word are you ready to help me
[1:11:49] the word overcome
[1:11:51] i love the way that the apostle was
[1:11:53] addressing these various uh segments of
[1:11:57] the believer
[1:11:59] speaking to the fathers to the elderly
[1:12:01] to those who who walked so in tune with
[1:12:05] the law
[1:12:07] that they were looking for god to show
[1:12:10] up and do something and while many of
[1:12:12] their brethren miss the coming of
[1:12:15] messiah there were some elders in this
[1:12:18] group that didn't miss his coming they
[1:12:20] knew who he was from a long way back
[1:12:24] they'd read every promise they'd heard
[1:12:26] every prophecy that was made concerning
[1:12:29] that messiah and though their church
[1:12:31] couldn't receive him and some of their
[1:12:33] family couldn't receive him the apostle
[1:12:36] mentions that there were some who knew
[1:12:39] him from far off you have known him that
[1:12:44] is from the beginning i'm telling you
[1:12:47] they recognized him to be their messiah
[1:12:50] uh josh i especially like tonight how
[1:12:54] the apostle addresses the young men i
[1:12:57] called your name i could have called
[1:12:58] david or
[1:13:00] or jesse or or
[1:13:02] austin or anybody else although austin
[1:13:04] is moving up a little bit in age you
[1:13:06] know but everybody is right
[1:13:08] and so
[1:13:10] they were addressed in such a in such a
[1:13:12] special way he said i write unto you
[1:13:15] young men because you have overcome
[1:13:19] the wicked one let me say that again i
[1:13:22] want you listening to me
[1:13:24] i write unto you young men because you
[1:13:28] have
[1:13:31] you have
[1:13:33] overcome the wicked one now this was
[1:13:35] god's apostle and he moved also in in
[1:13:39] prophetic things because all apostles do
[1:13:42] gifted by the spirit and so i believe
[1:13:46] that he could have said well you're
[1:13:48] doing very well now we're going to see
[1:13:50] how you do in the future
[1:13:52] you're you're on top of the mountain uh
[1:13:55] today but we don't know what might
[1:13:56] happen in your life you you might throw
[1:13:58] in the towel and forsake what you stood
[1:14:01] so strongly on uh some years back but he
[1:14:04] didn't say any of that church he said i
[1:14:07] write unto you because you have overcome
[1:14:12] the wicked one
[1:14:14] he has already been defeated in your
[1:14:18] life there's no reason for me to believe
[1:14:21] that he's going to be able to overtake
[1:14:23] you now
[1:14:25] you know i want that confidence in me
[1:14:27] i want that confidence in myself that
[1:14:30] because of who i belong to i have
[1:14:33] overcome the world by him
[1:14:35] i want to be able to look at my brothers
[1:14:37] and sisters and say hey i don't care
[1:14:39] what they face i don't care what may
[1:14:42] come their way i can say with boldness
[1:14:45] and confidence they have already
[1:14:47] overcome the wicked one why because they
[1:14:51] chose to ignore the lies of the enemy
[1:14:54] they chose to agree with god's word they
[1:14:57] chose not to be hindered for for drawn
[1:15:01] out periods of time but to seek god for
[1:15:03] a way to get out or a way to get over
[1:15:06] and so there's so much that we could we
[1:15:09] could read and i spent some time
[1:15:11] studying and it would take weeks
[1:15:13] to go into that and but i want to move
[1:15:15] on in first john chapter five
[1:15:18] beginning in verse four
[1:15:20] i want you to read four and five with me
[1:15:23] for whatsoever
[1:15:24] is born of god
[1:15:26] overcometh
[1:15:28] the world is that right
[1:15:33] how do you know
[1:15:34] that we're going to overcome the world
[1:15:37] because we are born of god
[1:15:40] maybe we should just establish this
[1:15:41] tonight is there anybody here that's
[1:15:43] born of god
[1:15:45] you are we're born of god it's the born
[1:15:47] against experience it's the promise it's
[1:15:50] it's meeting him
[1:15:52] it's the very thing that nicodemus was
[1:15:54] missing
[1:15:56] he wanted to have a personal experience
[1:15:57] with god
[1:15:59] he wasn't satisfied with just his
[1:16:00] religious existence or what he had been
[1:16:02] familiar with in the past he wanted to
[1:16:05] know god in a personal way and so he
[1:16:07] asked the lord how do we do this
[1:16:09] oh the answer came you must be born
[1:16:13] again which means born from above born
[1:16:16] from heaven born of god for whatsoever
[1:16:18] is born of god does what
[1:16:21] overcometh the world now listen
[1:16:24] carefully and this
[1:16:27] is the victory
[1:16:30] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:16:34] world
[1:16:36] this is the victory that overcometh the
[1:16:38] world what
[1:16:41] even
[1:16:42] our
[1:16:43] faith
[1:16:46] even
[1:16:47] our
[1:16:48] faith
[1:16:49] i'll tell you that's a powerful promise
[1:16:52] who is he
[1:16:54] who is he that overcometh the world but
[1:16:57] he that believeth that jesus is the son
[1:17:02] of god
[1:17:04] oh
[1:17:05] hallelujah now i want you to know that's
[1:17:06] not a head belief
[1:17:08] that's not just a head knowledge we rub
[1:17:11] shoulders with people all around us at
[1:17:12] all times who would tell you right now
[1:17:14] jesus is the son of god and he died to
[1:17:16] save the world but that doesn't mean
[1:17:18] that they've been born again
[1:17:20] it doesn't mean they've ever had that
[1:17:22] personal experience with him these
[1:17:24] apostles are talking to those who have
[1:17:26] been transformed from the kingdom of
[1:17:28] darkness into the kingdom of light and
[1:17:30] they've accomplished that by
[1:17:31] surrendering and yielding their lives to
[1:17:34] the lord jesus christ
[1:17:36] can i share a quotation or two with you
[1:17:38] this evening i know it's a camp meeting
[1:17:40] i know there are some of you who don't
[1:17:42] study the message of brother branham as
[1:17:43] we do but i want to i want to place
[1:17:45] these in here as well i can't help it i
[1:17:48] can't help it because these are the
[1:17:49] things that inspire me and push me and
[1:17:52] cause me to keep fighting in this whole
[1:17:54] world around us in a message called
[1:17:56] faith is our victory paragraph 59 i want
[1:18:00] you to listen carefully he said did not
[1:18:03] i tell you not to doubt
[1:18:06] he said to jairus that night or that day
[1:18:09] if you'll only believe
[1:18:12] only
[1:18:14] believe you can see the glory of god
[1:18:18] church i know that you will overcome if
[1:18:21] you'll just only believe if you'll just
[1:18:24] keep applying your faith i know not will
[1:18:30] little children i write unto you
[1:18:33] because you have
[1:18:35] overcome
[1:18:37] the wicked one
[1:18:38] he said
[1:18:39] you can see the glory of god if you'll
[1:18:41] only believe he said then faith
[1:18:44] overcomes death
[1:18:46] you believe that oh i do
[1:18:49] faith is the victory
[1:18:51] over
[1:18:52] death faith is the victory over sin
[1:18:57] faith is the victory over sickness now
[1:19:00] just put your finger there this isn't
[1:19:02] faith in faith
[1:19:04] this isn't saying faith my faith is in
[1:19:07] my faith
[1:19:08] now that won't work
[1:19:10] this is faith in the living god
[1:19:14] you see faith is not a good luck charm
[1:19:18] faith doesn't operate superstitiously
[1:19:21] it's faith that is properly grounded in
[1:19:25] the word of god and when you have that
[1:19:28] kind of faith and i perceive that you do
[1:19:30] tonight faith is the victory over sin
[1:19:33] faith is the victory over sickness faith
[1:19:36] is the victory over worry
[1:19:40] faith is the victory over
[1:19:42] is that a word
[1:19:46] flusterations
[1:19:48] have you ever been somewhere between a
[1:19:51] fluster and a frustration
[1:19:54] that is a flustration
[1:19:57] when you're between a fluster and a
[1:19:59] frustration and the prophet is telling
[1:20:01] us here tonight the answer to overcome
[1:20:04] that is exactly the same way it is all
[1:20:07] these other things faith is the victory
[1:20:10] over frustrations faith is the victory
[1:20:14] over the world can you say man
[1:20:17] now in a message called spiritual
[1:20:19] amnesia just stay with me
[1:20:21] in birmingham alabama
[1:20:24] i like this so much
[1:20:26] worry
[1:20:27] has no virtue to it at all
[1:20:33] we sure do give a whole lot of time to
[1:20:35] something
[1:20:36] that has no virtue
[1:20:38] and no ability to accomplish anything in
[1:20:40] our life
[1:20:41] worry has no virtue in it at all
[1:20:44] just skip worry and accept faith
[1:20:48] somebody said well you you know to say
[1:20:50] it like that it makes it so simple
[1:20:52] brother it is simple
[1:20:54] it's one decision at a time
[1:20:58] it's one obstacle at a time it's one
[1:21:01] trial at a time it's one flusteration at
[1:21:04] a time each time you meet the enemy in
[1:21:08] whatever form he shows up you make a
[1:21:11] decision in that moment i will not waste
[1:21:14] my life with worry i will not waste my
[1:21:17] life with anxiety in this moment i
[1:21:20] choose faith faith is the answer to the
[1:21:23] to whatever the situation is he said
[1:21:26] just skip worry and accept faith someone
[1:21:29] said well now what if you're going to be
[1:21:31] shot in the morning
[1:21:37] wouldn't you worry
[1:21:40] you know that that's funny i'm gonna
[1:21:42] tell you why it's funny
[1:21:43] not because it's silly
[1:21:46] it's funny because it's just like us
[1:21:52] we're crossing bridges we hadn't got to
[1:21:54] yet
[1:21:56] we're worrying about situations that we
[1:21:58] may never face
[1:21:59] we're blocked and hindered and that we
[1:22:02] have obstacles that aren't even real
[1:22:05] they're mirages
[1:22:07] they're not even real there's something
[1:22:09] not some i'm not saying that every time
[1:22:11] the enemy comes he's not laying
[1:22:13] something real in your path often he is
[1:22:15] but that's not what i'm talking about
[1:22:16] with worry worry is most often attached
[1:22:21] to something that may not even come to
[1:22:24] pass
[1:22:26] if you're faced with a situation and
[1:22:27] you're worrying you're worrying about
[1:22:29] the outcome don't you know god's got
[1:22:31] that
[1:22:32] don't you know he has the answer for
[1:22:34] whatever's going on he said well what if
[1:22:37] you knew we're going to be shot in the
[1:22:38] morning wouldn't you worry i said no
[1:22:40] don't think so
[1:22:42] why
[1:22:43] i said worry couldn't do nothing but
[1:22:46] make me worse
[1:22:48] i wish somebody i'm not expecting you
[1:22:50] all to but i wish somebody look at your
[1:22:53] neighbor and say worry can't do anything
[1:22:56] but make you worse
[1:22:59] it doesn't change a thing
[1:23:01] it doesn't move one symptom out of the
[1:23:03] way
[1:23:04] it doesn't solve one problem
[1:23:06] and it cheats you out of the victory
[1:23:09] that your faith can accomplish if you'll
[1:23:12] invest your faith instead is that right
[1:23:15] he said well what good is it going to do
[1:23:17] to have faith i said it might deliver me
[1:23:21] and that's right see
[1:23:23] faith might pull me out of the situation
[1:23:26] altogether i may not even have to face
[1:23:29] what i'm worried about because faith may
[1:23:32] move that right out of the way or move
[1:23:34] me out of the way
[1:23:35] all right it might deliver me and that's
[1:23:38] right see so worry has no virtue to it
[1:23:41] at all
[1:23:42] but faith has all virtue
[1:23:45] remember in peter it tells us to add to
[1:23:47] our faith what
[1:23:49] to add to our faith virtue believe not
[1:23:52] now worry sometime excuse me now worry
[1:23:56] sometime cause it
[1:23:58] and he goes on into another thought
[1:23:59] we're not going to follow him there let
[1:24:01] me do another one this is called faith
[1:24:03] is our victory it's a long one but
[1:24:06] you're here and we won't have to be late
[1:24:08] but we're going to take time to get this
[1:24:09] out because whatever god is giving to
[1:24:12] brother brooks on our behalf we want to
[1:24:14] come in here without any hindrances in
[1:24:17] our spirit at all
[1:24:20] our mind cleared because we are fully
[1:24:23] trusting in the lord you leave your
[1:24:26] problem at the door and you might find
[1:24:28] when you get back to it it's not even
[1:24:30] there
[1:24:31] if you find that it's there you'll meet
[1:24:33] that challenge like we've met all the
[1:24:35] other challenges of our life since we
[1:24:37] were born of the spirit of god we will
[1:24:40] meet that challenge by faith if you
[1:24:42] believe that say amen
[1:24:43] now faith is a conqueror
[1:24:46] faith is an overcomer
[1:24:48] how so
[1:24:49] uh if we looked at the theme of this
[1:24:51] meeting
[1:24:52] how to overcome
[1:24:54] anything how
[1:24:56] faith faith is a conqueror faith is an
[1:25:00] overcomer it's it just isn't a
[1:25:02] peacemaker
[1:25:03] it overcomes
[1:25:05] faith itself overcomes faith is the
[1:25:08] victory that overcomes the world he said
[1:25:12] what does it do what is faith what is to
[1:25:15] conquer
[1:25:16] conquer and victory is the same
[1:25:20] oh my
[1:25:21] we can have victory
[1:25:23] we can have victory this week
[1:25:25] we can have victory tonight
[1:25:27] faith can accomplish the victory faith
[1:25:30] can give us the grace to conquer and to
[1:25:32] overcome he said to conquer it means to
[1:25:36] beat down
[1:25:38] to override to handcuff to throw into
[1:25:42] prison
[1:25:43] it means that the sin that once ruled
[1:25:46] you
[1:25:50] come on i want you to read that
[1:25:56] in every place in your life where
[1:25:58] unbelief used to reign
[1:26:01] you have dispossessed that enemy
[1:26:04] by taking god at his word you have
[1:26:06] driven that enemy out of the land
[1:26:08] and where every sin once ruled your life
[1:26:12] you
[1:26:12] now rule it
[1:26:15] somebody said i don't feel like a ruler
[1:26:17] i don't feel like a conqueror i don't
[1:26:19] feel like an overcomer that's not what
[1:26:21] we're here to talk about tonight
[1:26:23] because feelings can come and feelings
[1:26:26] can go but truth will always be truth
[1:26:30] and here's the truth jesus christ
[1:26:33] the same yesterday help me
[1:26:35] and today
[1:26:37] and forever
[1:26:39] it means that the sin that once ruled
[1:26:41] you you rule it now it means that you
[1:26:43] have overcome it
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:46] you've whimped it we know not in our own
[1:26:48] strength
[1:26:49] you've whipped it you are greater than
[1:26:52] it is oh
[1:26:53] i feel religious right now
[1:26:56] he said which was first
[1:26:58] a sinner or a savior the answer a savior
[1:27:02] for a savior is more powerful than a sin
[1:27:09] no sin
[1:27:10] no unbelief
[1:27:12] no attribute of unbelief is greater
[1:27:15] or bigger than his power to deliver the
[1:27:19] sinner he is a savior do you believe
[1:27:21] that he said which was first the healer
[1:27:25] or a sickness
[1:27:27] he said it couldn't be a healer unless
[1:27:29] he was over the sickness
[1:27:30] it is a healer
[1:27:33] it can conquer the sickness if the
[1:27:36] healer came first then we know it
[1:27:39] conquers sickness every time if the
[1:27:41] savior came first we know that it
[1:27:43] conquers sin every time let's read on
[1:27:46] just a bit and faith is the victory
[1:27:48] that overcomes every curse of the devil
[1:27:53] faith is the victory hallelujah faith in
[1:27:56] what
[1:27:58] not faith in your church
[1:28:02] not faith in your creed
[1:28:05] not faith in some man
[1:28:08] not even a prophet not even apostle not
[1:28:10] even your pastor
[1:28:12] but faith where
[1:28:15] hallelujah why is that so important
[1:28:17] because he's the one that made the
[1:28:18] promise
[1:28:19] he said that's the victory what is it it
[1:28:22] is the victory faith in jesus christ is
[1:28:26] the victory that overcomes the world
[1:28:29] hallelujah
[1:28:30] we know that because we see it right
[1:28:32] here
[1:28:33] all right it goes on 65
[1:28:36] when you can climb into god
[1:28:39] by prayer
[1:28:40] until you see the thing conquered under
[1:28:43] you
[1:28:44] there is nothing that can hurt you
[1:28:49] then
[1:28:54] i want to just pause a moment
[1:28:57] because we're always seeing ourselves
[1:29:00] we see ourselves
[1:29:02] i'm not just talking about our physical
[1:29:04] form in the mirror
[1:29:05] we we are always seeing ourself
[1:29:08] and we see ourselves in certain ways
[1:29:10] and that's why people own things
[1:29:13] that do not belong to them
[1:29:17] they use it as a crutch sometimes i've
[1:29:19] used it i've done it there's no
[1:29:20] condemnation in my voice
[1:29:22] i've used it too we can use that like a
[1:29:25] crutch sometime to lean on instead of
[1:29:27] getting down to where the rubber meets
[1:29:29] the road
[1:29:30] your testimony will have far more
[1:29:33] effectiveness in this world if you will
[1:29:36] take god at his word and daily allow
[1:29:40] your faith in god to conquer every
[1:29:43] situation that's trying to overcome you
[1:29:47] again you do it one decision at a time
[1:29:49] and one praise at a time
[1:29:51] i choose to take god at his word and i
[1:29:53] praise you lord that you've never failed
[1:29:55] me yet
[1:29:57] i choose to take god at his word and i
[1:29:59] praise you lord that you've never failed
[1:30:01] me
[1:30:02] i choose to take god at his word and i
[1:30:05] praise you lord that as you have brought
[1:30:07] me through every time before i know that
[1:30:10] i know that i know in whom i have
[1:30:12] believed and i know that he's given me
[1:30:14] power
[1:30:16] to overcome anything
[1:30:18] and everything no matter what color it
[1:30:21] is no matter what it looks like no
[1:30:23] matter how ugly it is no matter how huge
[1:30:26] it may be
[1:30:27] your faith in god will give you the
[1:30:29] victory if you'll take him at his word
[1:30:32] every time
[1:30:34] every time don't we preach this a lot
[1:30:36] every time we got to we've got to be
[1:30:38] reminded why because we're in that
[1:30:40] greatest battle ever fought
[1:30:42] we're going to get to something in a
[1:30:43] minute i i know i got to hurry but we're
[1:30:46] going to get to something in a minute he
[1:30:47] said
[1:30:48] until you see the thing conquered under
[1:30:50] you there's nothing that can hurt you
[1:30:52] then you've overcome
[1:30:54] you got 50 miles of elbow room
[1:30:58] nothing's closing in on you
[1:31:00] once you have made up your mind you're
[1:31:02] sailing free then you believe that
[1:31:05] he said you who have been a drunkard and
[1:31:07] a slave to whiskey you'll be the master
[1:31:10] over him then
[1:31:11] that old devil of alcohol that made you
[1:31:13] drink he's your master now but when you
[1:31:16] get faith
[1:31:18] i don't mean make believe real faith
[1:31:21] he's your servant
[1:31:23] then
[1:31:24] oh i give you power over over some of
[1:31:27] the powers of evil no he said i give you
[1:31:31] power over all the power
[1:31:34] all the power of the enemy over
[1:31:36] spiritual principalities over spiritual
[1:31:39] wickedness and high places
[1:31:41] nothing shall stand in your way
[1:31:45] is your faith real is your god real are
[1:31:47] you putting your real faith in the hands
[1:31:49] of a real god then he is our victory he
[1:31:53] is our victory
[1:31:56] he's your servant then i love that stay
[1:31:58] with me i love that
[1:32:00] i love the thought of someone being
[1:32:03] bound for years under some heavy
[1:32:05] oppression and all of a sudden coming
[1:32:07] through to victory
[1:32:09] and saying wait a minute devil you who
[1:32:11] has held me all these years you're under
[1:32:14] my foot now
[1:32:16] you're never getting out from under my
[1:32:17] foot
[1:32:19] he said a woman that's sitting present
[1:32:20] now she has been at this altar time
[1:32:23] after time after time listen now
[1:32:28] because you may be like this little
[1:32:29] woman
[1:32:30] you might be just like her
[1:32:33] ah
[1:32:35] that's not what i have next okay there
[1:32:37] we go no yeah
[1:32:39] a little woman that's sorry
[1:32:41] oh you're so good to help me go back to
[1:32:43] 67.
[1:32:45] you can't lay down it's really hard for
[1:32:47] me when i look up there and then look
[1:32:48] down here to know where i am forgive me
[1:32:50] i'm just a flawed vessel
[1:32:53] you who can't lay down tobacco you women
[1:32:55] and men when it comes to a place to
[1:32:57] where you can get to that spot to where
[1:32:59] you have overcome it by faith you'll
[1:33:02] master it then you know what i love
[1:33:04] about that statement there's no
[1:33:06] condemnation in that
[1:33:08] here's a man a sinner saved by grace
[1:33:11] who understands the struggles of life
[1:33:13] who knows that there are people being
[1:33:15] held by alcohol their people being held
[1:33:17] by tobacco or whatever the attribute of
[1:33:19] sin is because we preach in this church
[1:33:22] that all these things are attributes of
[1:33:24] sin
[1:33:24] they all stem out of the real sin and
[1:33:27] the real sin is unbelief and when you
[1:33:30] can conquer unbelief and take god at his
[1:33:32] word and believe he'll do what he said
[1:33:34] he'll do there's no room for the
[1:33:36] attributes of sin to manifest in your
[1:33:38] life it causes you to want to walk a
[1:33:40] holy walk it causes you to want to live
[1:33:42] sanctified and set apart for the use of
[1:33:45] the master are you with me
[1:33:47] when it comes to a play all right a
[1:33:49] little woman that's sitting present now
[1:33:51] want you to hear it because you may be
[1:33:52] like this little woman
[1:33:54] she's been at this altar time after time
[1:33:56] after time a good woman but she started
[1:33:58] smoking a long time ago and she just
[1:34:01] couldn't overcome it
[1:34:03] and she had come up and i'd pray with
[1:34:05] her and seemed like she just couldn't
[1:34:07] overcome it and the first thing you know
[1:34:09] i told her here i said there will be
[1:34:12] danger down the road
[1:34:14] she said brother branham i've cried i
[1:34:17] have begged you see just emotional i
[1:34:20] want you to notice this next phrase here
[1:34:22] doing what
[1:34:27] fighting the air
[1:34:29] this shadow boxing is never going to get
[1:34:32] the job done
[1:34:34] we are not those who fight against the
[1:34:37] air we know who our enemy is and we know
[1:34:40] how to defeat him by the authority of
[1:34:42] jesus christ
[1:34:44] but here there's a woman fighting the
[1:34:45] air that won't do any good and i'd get
[1:34:49] down and pray with her and lay hands on
[1:34:52] her and she'd go back a few days i'd
[1:34:54] meet her again just knock you down the
[1:34:56] cigarette smoke hand still brown this
[1:34:59] was a woman really bound and one night
[1:35:01] down yonder she went to the doctor began
[1:35:03] to get sick and wither away till just a
[1:35:05] little spindly thing the doctor looked
[1:35:07] into her and said cancer
[1:35:10] smoking cigarettes there she was laying
[1:35:13] there to die then she got down to
[1:35:16] business
[1:35:18] i want you to hear what the prophet's
[1:35:19] saying all that praying in the altar
[1:35:25] all those times she went up for the
[1:35:27] pastor to pray for him
[1:35:30] and yet the prophet saying
[1:35:32] now she got down to business what was
[1:35:33] she doing all the rest of the time he
[1:35:35] tells us fighting the air
[1:35:37] [Applause]
[1:35:38] you you can't just get mad
[1:35:41] you gotta know where to get mad
[1:35:44] and who to turn your anger against
[1:35:47] and it's not god it's not your brother
[1:35:50] it's not your church it's not your
[1:35:51] pastor it's the one who wants to bind
[1:35:54] you
[1:35:55] until you are overcome instead of you
[1:35:58] being the overcomer she was laying there
[1:36:00] about to die she got down to business
[1:36:02] are you still here good good good good
[1:36:04] all right see a drowning man will reach
[1:36:06] for a straw long as you can walk out of
[1:36:08] the church tonight know you can go join
[1:36:10] the methodist baptist as long as you can
[1:36:12] sit here and say i'm a good person
[1:36:14] there's nothing wrong with me yeah you
[1:36:16] can't do nothing with you that's right
[1:36:18] all right it goes on but when you see
[1:36:20] your sins as god sees them
[1:36:23] in the light of his bible when you see
[1:36:26] you'll repent or perish
[1:36:27] something will take place you'll get to
[1:36:31] business
[1:36:33] anybody here
[1:36:34] he said walk out of here smothering
[1:36:36] around your heart the doctor back there
[1:36:39] maybe raise up and come look at it it's
[1:36:40] a heart attack you'll get to business
[1:36:44] that's when she had to get to business
[1:36:45] and the woman sitting looking at me
[1:36:47] right now and brother roberson back
[1:36:49] there mr wood and brother wood sitting
[1:36:50] here and he goes on to talk about some
[1:36:52] other thing he said and the holy spirit
[1:36:54] seemed to move us to go way through the
[1:36:56] knobs to where she was and when i got
[1:36:58] there she had had a dream he's talking
[1:37:00] about hunting and
[1:37:03] getting this leadership of the lord to
[1:37:04] go and pray and when the holy spirit
[1:37:06] came into the room she got down to real
[1:37:08] business she never smoked a cigarette
[1:37:10] from then on and she has gained many
[1:37:13] pounds of weight and they can't find a
[1:37:14] trace of cancer
[1:37:16] [Music]
[1:37:17] she didn't have to get good enough to
[1:37:19] get healed from cancer
[1:37:21] she just had to apply her faith
[1:37:23] to the only god to the only force to the
[1:37:26] only answer for her situation
[1:37:29] come on
[1:37:30] she was not laboring to get to rest
[1:37:33] she was laboring to get rid of
[1:37:34] cigarettes
[1:37:37] you'll spin your wheels
[1:37:39] if you choose something and that's all
[1:37:41] you you focus on i got to get rid of
[1:37:43] that i got to overcome that i got to do
[1:37:45] this i got to bring that down and you
[1:37:47] focus on one thing let me tell you
[1:37:49] something you'll beat the air
[1:37:51] you'll stay in that vicious cycle
[1:37:54] people come along they say oh i've had
[1:37:56] so many bad experiences in church i want
[1:37:58] you to know i understand
[1:38:02] i have to
[1:38:06] you know why you've had so many problems
[1:38:08] in church
[1:38:09] because people go there
[1:38:13] you'd had problems with the cotton meal
[1:38:17] if you spend as much time in the cotton
[1:38:19] mill as you do church you're going to
[1:38:20] have problems in the cotton mill
[1:38:23] if you spend as much time at walmart and
[1:38:25] some of you do
[1:38:27] as you do at church you're going to have
[1:38:28] problems at walmart
[1:38:30] problems are where people are
[1:38:33] problems will follow you
[1:38:35] amen but despising church is not the
[1:38:39] answer no don't you dare do that
[1:38:41] don't you put the blame on hypocrites
[1:38:44] because when people will give the excuse
[1:38:46] i can't go to church because there's so
[1:38:48] many hypocrites there the the most
[1:38:50] tragic reality is you are placing those
[1:38:54] hypocrites closer to god
[1:38:56] than you are
[1:38:59] you're saying i can't get over or around
[1:39:02] the hypocrites
[1:39:04] then you're placing him in a closer
[1:39:06] position to god than you are let me tell
[1:39:08] you the answer to how to overcome people
[1:39:11] get your eyes off of people and get your
[1:39:17] eyes on jesus would somebody help me
[1:39:20] preach
[1:39:22] some of you are sitting here tonight
[1:39:24] some of you are streaming this service
[1:39:26] tonight struggling in a manner you do
[1:39:28] not have to struggle
[1:39:31] until we make up our mind to get down to
[1:39:33] business
[1:39:34] and to get our eyes off of one another
[1:39:42] and get our eyes on jesus we're going to
[1:39:44] be like a bunch of shadow we're just
[1:39:46] going to be beating the air
[1:39:48] and never getting the victory i've got
[1:39:51] to have the victory
[1:39:54] i've laid out some things this week
[1:39:56] folks
[1:39:56] that i have to have the victory over
[1:39:59] personal things
[1:40:02] i like to be transparent
[1:40:04] but i'll just be real honest with you
[1:40:06] some of it is so so me
[1:40:10] and nothing to do with you
[1:40:12] until i'm just going to be real honest
[1:40:14] and say it's none of your business
[1:40:17] but i have laid it before the lord
[1:40:21] something that i know is controlling me
[1:40:22] i'll just say it this way i'll get
[1:40:24] forwards out before it's over i'll spit
[1:40:25] it out
[1:40:27] something that i know is controlling me
[1:40:29] instead of me controlling it
[1:40:30] that's what it is
[1:40:32] something personal that i know has more
[1:40:34] authority at times i give it
[1:40:37] i yield it
[1:40:38] i let that determine how things turn out
[1:40:41] instead of going to him
[1:40:42] i'm not preaching as someone who's made
[1:40:44] it all the way and now i can reach back
[1:40:46] down to you and tell you how oh no
[1:40:49] i'm preaching to you tonight as somebody
[1:40:50] that's fighting the same battles that
[1:40:52] you're fighting living in the same
[1:40:54] satan's eden that you're living in under
[1:40:56] the same level to see in church age
[1:40:57] spirit that you're living under
[1:40:59] mine may smell different or look
[1:41:01] different or sound a little bit
[1:41:02] different than yours but it's the same
[1:41:04] devil
[1:41:07] how many of you believe that whatever
[1:41:09] you just keep the bible tells us that
[1:41:11] when we focus our attention and our
[1:41:13] affection because where your attention
[1:41:15] goes your affection will follow
[1:41:17] love not the world he said
[1:41:19] a little while longer love not the world
[1:41:21] neither the things of the world
[1:41:23] if you keep your eyes on the world your
[1:41:25] affection is going to be on the world
[1:41:27] you're going to love the world
[1:41:29] if we will choose to look at truth
[1:41:32] truth is a person truth isn't a book
[1:41:36] truth is a person
[1:41:38] truth is on board
[1:41:40] when we're born of god
[1:41:41] when we've yielded our lives to jesus
[1:41:43] christ truth is in us it abides with us
[1:41:47] and i have laid some things out before
[1:41:50] the lord this week
[1:41:51] for this week
[1:41:53] and i've written them down you don't
[1:41:55] have to do like me you should
[1:41:58] you should expose
[1:42:00] the devil in your own life
[1:42:04] you don't have to show me
[1:42:06] i don't have a backwards collar on today
[1:42:10] i'm not here to take your confession
[1:42:12] i don't even need to know what you're
[1:42:14] fighting with
[1:42:15] you don't have to know what i deal with
[1:42:18] i'm writing it down so i can't change my
[1:42:20] mind
[1:42:21] i'm writing it down so i can keep
[1:42:23] bringing it before the lord if the if
[1:42:25] the theme of these meetings no matter
[1:42:27] what the preacher preaches is how to
[1:42:29] overcome anything then by sunday
[1:42:31] afternoon i am fully expecting
[1:42:35] i'm telling you my testimony i am fully
[1:42:38] expecting to be a conqueror over
[1:42:41] everything that has conquered me
[1:42:44] why because i didn't come up with the
[1:42:46] theme the holy spirit revealed why i'm
[1:42:50] calling you together i want you to know
[1:42:52] how to overcome
[1:42:54] anything
[1:42:56] i said to the brothers but that don't i
[1:42:58] know that don't sound just right
[1:43:00] that's how it came to me but that don't
[1:43:02] just sound right i don't want to just
[1:43:04] say everything
[1:43:06] i want to say anything because my
[1:43:08] anything
[1:43:09] is different than your anything
[1:43:12] and everything just feels like a
[1:43:13] catch-all
[1:43:15] i want you to specifically
[1:43:17] either
[1:43:18] share with the lord or as i have write
[1:43:21] it down and say i have no intention of
[1:43:24] being under the control of this thing
[1:43:29] sunday afternoon
[1:43:31] i don't know what god's going to do i
[1:43:33] don't know how he's going to do it
[1:43:35] shackles may fall off on us
[1:43:37] from us when we're dancing
[1:43:42] oh yes
[1:43:43] well i don't believe in behaving like
[1:43:44] that uh we weren't really
[1:43:47] making an interview here to find out
[1:43:48] what you believed
[1:43:51] i believe in dancing
[1:43:53] i believe in jumping
[1:43:55] i believe in clapping my hands i believe
[1:43:58] in shouting unto the lord with the voice
[1:44:00] of triumph
[1:44:02] i'm going to dance
[1:44:04] i'm going to give god praise it may be
[1:44:06] in one of those moments when we're
[1:44:07] worshiping sister beth that we just
[1:44:10] shake off those shackles or whatever it
[1:44:12] is whatever your anything looks like
[1:44:15] it might be like that somebody said well
[1:44:17] that ain't likely
[1:44:22] i have a tendency to agree with you
[1:44:25] because you know right now
[1:44:28] whether right now
[1:44:29] you know whether you have any intention
[1:44:32] [Music]
[1:44:34] of going all the way with him i'm not
[1:44:36] saying you have to dance oh no no no no
[1:44:38] no
[1:44:39] i'm not saying you have to dance i'm not
[1:44:41] saying you have to jump i'm not saying
[1:44:42] you have to speak in tongues but i will
[1:44:44] say that most of us know right now
[1:44:46] what's likely and what's not likely
[1:44:50] it might be for somebody that just
[1:44:52] breaks out and takes a run a lap around
[1:44:54] this church
[1:44:56] well somebody said well they've done
[1:44:57] that before and it might not have
[1:44:59] shifted i'm just telling you with a
[1:45:01] theme like how to overcome anything
[1:45:04] it may come when brother brooks is up
[1:45:07] here singing like a i tell you what he
[1:45:09] blesses me
[1:45:12] i took a little video there on the front
[1:45:13] row of him last year beating the
[1:45:14] tambourine
[1:45:16] you know paul wes bought him a
[1:45:18] tambourine and he leaves it here
[1:45:20] and
[1:45:21] last year i think it was we asked him to
[1:45:23] autograph it
[1:45:25] so we've got his signature on it and
[1:45:27] he's been beating a tambourine since the
[1:45:30] late 80s when i met him to worship the
[1:45:32] lord and i've been in service this where
[1:45:34] he got a little criticism for that
[1:45:36] can you imagine
[1:45:38] [Music]
[1:45:40] you sitting on your hands
[1:45:45] oh pious
[1:45:47] and you're gonna dare criticize somebody
[1:45:50] for ringing a tambourine
[1:45:53] my god what kind of religious spirit are
[1:45:55] you under
[1:45:58] what in the world has got a hold of you
[1:46:01] come on
[1:46:02] like some people will uh view a video or
[1:46:04] they may come and what's that waving
[1:46:06] them flags and
[1:46:09] stringing them banners through the air
[1:46:10] and doing all that i'd never catch
[1:46:13] myself doing that just like i said just
[1:46:15] like i said
[1:46:16] you pretty well know what you're going
[1:46:18] to do for this thing's over
[1:46:21] i want you to know something tonight if
[1:46:23] i could guarantee you the victory over
[1:46:25] that thing this that's holding you back
[1:46:28] by by jumping up here and waving a flag
[1:46:35] i know you'd be standing in line some of
[1:46:37] you still wouldn't do it because you're
[1:46:38] determined not to budge
[1:46:41] but i know that you'll be standing in
[1:46:42] line if you thought for one minute
[1:46:45] that taking a little bit of faith and
[1:46:47] saying god i need you to know
[1:46:51] [Music]
[1:46:54] somebody said well what if it's what if
[1:46:56] it's blue or purple or i don't care what
[1:46:58] color it is it can be your flag of
[1:46:59] surrender
[1:47:01] and you don't have to have a banner to
[1:47:02] wave a flag of surrender
[1:47:04] you may be standing at your seat while
[1:47:07] brother uh
[1:47:09] brooks is worshiping the lord and i said
[1:47:11] a minute ago i took a little video of
[1:47:13] and tens of thousands of people have
[1:47:15] watched that video i don't know i don't
[1:47:17] even remember the number but tens of
[1:47:19] thousands of people have watched that
[1:47:21] little video
[1:47:22] and i read some of the most wonderful
[1:47:24] it's been a year now i read some of the
[1:47:26] most wonderful comments from people of
[1:47:28] all faiths
[1:47:29] all to have that kind of freedom oh to
[1:47:32] have that kind of freedom and one little
[1:47:34] woman wrote this she said i cannot
[1:47:36] believe that you people are in there
[1:47:37] without masks
[1:47:39] [Laughter]
[1:47:41] i'm not criticizing that i'm not i'm not
[1:47:43] against that not at all but what i want
[1:47:46] to know is why in the world
[1:47:48] that's all you could think
[1:47:51] see that woman is never likely to dance
[1:47:53] her way to victory
[1:47:56] she is never likely to wave her hands
[1:47:59] and come to victory unless something is
[1:48:02] able to penetrate her made up mind
[1:48:06] to find the thumbs down
[1:48:10] instead of the thumbs up
[1:48:13] you see i tell you it's not mind over
[1:48:16] matter not at all it's the mind of
[1:48:19] christ over the mind of the flesh
[1:48:23] it's taking his mind and going with that
[1:48:27] because you have the mind of christ
[1:48:28] somebody say i have the mind of christ
[1:48:32] all right we've got to go on where were
[1:48:34] we cancer was the last what is it it's
[1:48:36] faith that overcomes i'm nearly done
[1:48:39] his faith had overcome why didn't it
[1:48:41] overcome when i was praying for her here
[1:48:45] good question
[1:48:46] she was just fluttering around
[1:48:53] god knows how sincere
[1:48:56] you are
[1:49:00] god knows when you say pray for me if
[1:49:02] you really mean
[1:49:04] when you go up to someone gifted in the
[1:49:06] spirit and you say if you see something
[1:49:08] about me would you please come and tell
[1:49:10] me and talk to me about it god knows
[1:49:11] whether you mean that or not
[1:49:14] maybe you mean if you see something
[1:49:15] blessing on me that god's going to give
[1:49:17] me come and tell me but if it's
[1:49:19] something i need to line up and make a
[1:49:21] little adjustment on then don't bother
[1:49:24] you see god sees your heart brother bam
[1:49:26] said that woman was at the altar all the
[1:49:28] time and he went down and prayed for her
[1:49:30] and we know the miracles
[1:49:33] there's a woman sitting right back here
[1:49:35] sister west who knows what god could do
[1:49:38] in a meeting like that
[1:49:40] because she was healed in a prayer line
[1:49:42] where brother branham prayed and he said
[1:49:44] your back trouble has left you
[1:49:48] and it left her
[1:49:51] not because brother branham did it
[1:49:52] because he was in touch with the one who
[1:49:55] purchased that healing
[1:49:59] so she knew and that same god that moved
[1:50:01] for sister west and tens of thousands of
[1:50:03] others was willing to move for that
[1:50:05] woman
[1:50:06] and that same servant of god came and
[1:50:08] laid hands on her
[1:50:10] why didn't she overcome what i was
[1:50:11] praying for she was just fluttering
[1:50:13] around but when the doctor says you got
[1:50:15] cancer and gonna die
[1:50:17] she got to business
[1:50:18] he said that's the way it has to get
[1:50:21] oh my
[1:50:23] i know some of you
[1:50:25] are uh
[1:50:26] slowing down
[1:50:28] but i'm not ready to slow down just yet
[1:50:31] i want you to hear this
[1:50:32] he said why not get down to business now
[1:50:35] why wait that long put your faith in god
[1:50:41] are you sitting here tonight waiting on
[1:50:42] somebody to vindicate you or validate
[1:50:45] you
[1:50:46] or are you waiting for god to deliver
[1:50:48] you
[1:50:49] and if you're willing for god to deliver
[1:50:52] you he's here
[1:50:53] he's here he's here to deliver us
[1:50:59] well i don't want that woman to lay
[1:51:01] hands on me well i don't want that man
[1:51:03] to lay hands on me see see how we are
[1:51:08] i've seen people i didn't particularly
[1:51:10] want to lay hands on me
[1:51:11] but i'm not going to make no big fuss
[1:51:14] distract and destroy a service
[1:51:17] let me tell you something i know who the
[1:51:18] overcomer is he's in here he lives in
[1:51:21] here
[1:51:22] nobody's going to put something on me
[1:51:23] because
[1:51:24] of a situation like that i'm not going
[1:51:26] to live in that kind of fear do you hear
[1:51:27] what i'm saying
[1:51:29] and i want you to know that one that you
[1:51:31] you're not sure that you want them to
[1:51:32] pray for you that might be the one that
[1:51:34] god has ordained
[1:51:39] whoa
[1:51:41] i didn't mean to say that
[1:51:43] i didn't plan that ain't in the notes
[1:51:47] what if that somebody's a woman a woman
[1:51:54] is it possible
[1:51:56] you read the book
[1:51:58] you read the book
[1:52:00] i don't believe the bible uh is
[1:52:04] saying that women should pastor churches
[1:52:06] i don't believe that and this goes all
[1:52:08] the way out over the internet and i'm
[1:52:09] not ashamed i'm going to stay with the
[1:52:11] word
[1:52:12] but i want you to know
[1:52:14] that's not what i'm talking about
[1:52:17] i'm not calling any sisters in here to
[1:52:19] pastor a church
[1:52:21] what i'm calling them to do or what i'm
[1:52:23] bringing to your attention is that very
[1:52:25] one that you're so sure
[1:52:27] you've got more than they do that may be
[1:52:30] the one that god would send to help you
[1:52:34] along the way would you want your
[1:52:37] prejudice
[1:52:39] toward a particular person
[1:52:41] to cut you off
[1:52:43] from receiving what you need to receive
[1:52:45] from the lord in this meeting
[1:52:48] there's no room for prejudices racial
[1:52:51] prejudices gender prejudices religious
[1:52:55] prejudices
[1:52:59] amen i've had some of the most tattooed
[1:53:04] pierced
[1:53:05] folks
[1:53:06] you've ever seen in your life
[1:53:10] say brother
[1:53:11] i'd like to pray for you
[1:53:15] and you know what
[1:53:16] i knew god sent some of them my way
[1:53:20] and here's the good thing is when you
[1:53:21] when you're willing like that you can
[1:53:23] always say now it's my turn
[1:53:26] let me pray for you
[1:53:28] don't you decide how it's going to come
[1:53:33] he sent his word to heal us
[1:53:35] he said his word to deliver us
[1:53:38] brother brooks may be preaching up here
[1:53:41] shouting and carrying on and giving us
[1:53:43] the word and you may feel those shackles
[1:53:46] fly off
[1:53:47] and god give you an overcoming anointing
[1:53:50] it may happen that way i don't know how
[1:53:52] it's going to happen but i'm encouraging
[1:53:55] you put your faith in god and let him
[1:53:58] give you the victory over anything
[1:54:00] over anything
[1:54:03] you're still with me
[1:54:05] all right but when she changed her faith
[1:54:06] let me let me finish this
[1:54:08] he said that's the way it has to get
[1:54:09] when you get to business why wait that
[1:54:11] long why not get down to business now
[1:54:13] put your faith in god
[1:54:17] what if that woman
[1:54:19] what if the woman had had her faith in
[1:54:21] me
[1:54:22] i'd have failed
[1:54:25] because i'm a man
[1:54:28] you reckon that's true
[1:54:30] yes it is
[1:54:32] i'm a man
[1:54:34] amen god doesn't have god serving him
[1:54:37] he has men
[1:54:38] that have become sons of god
[1:54:41] because the son of god became a son of
[1:54:42] man that we the fallen sons of men may
[1:54:45] become the sons of god i tell you that's
[1:54:47] a pretty powerful redemption story isn't
[1:54:49] it all right so she said uh but
[1:54:52] then it failed cause i'm a man but when
[1:54:54] she changed her faith not in the
[1:54:56] brethren tabernacle or within branham or
[1:54:58] in anything else but placed our faith in
[1:55:00] jesus christ
[1:55:02] not in the upc or the aopc or the
[1:55:05] assembly of god or
[1:55:07] none of that
[1:55:08] she placed her faith in the lord jesus
[1:55:11] christ look what happened to her look
[1:55:14] what happened to her
[1:55:15] she raised up above all the fears
[1:55:18] and the doubts
[1:55:20] and god did what
[1:55:22] he healed her he delivered her from that
[1:55:25] thing that was trying to overcome her
[1:55:27] she got the victory oh
[1:55:29] she overcome faith is the victory that
[1:55:33] overcome i want you to give god praise i
[1:55:35] don't know that woman
[1:55:37] [Applause]
[1:55:38] but i praise the lord
[1:55:41] for her journey to get there
[1:55:44] he said she's sitting right here looking
[1:55:45] at me
[1:55:47] you might be the woman
[1:55:49] [Music]
[1:55:51] it may not be sick it may be anything i
[1:55:54] don't know what it is
[1:55:55] but you may be in the same position that
[1:55:57] woman was in fighting the air coming for
[1:56:00] prayer coming for prayer come in for
[1:56:02] prayer come in for prayer come into
[1:56:03] prayer
[1:56:06] i don't want to offend hurt make mad
[1:56:09] unless it will help you
[1:56:11] but i can't tell you the times
[1:56:13] that people will come
[1:56:14] over and over and over and over and over
[1:56:19] and over again through the years and
[1:56:20] it's always about my past
[1:56:27] and because i have a past
[1:56:29] did you know you have a past
[1:56:32] i guess it's
[1:56:34] like an opinion
[1:56:36] we all have one
[1:56:38] we all have a past
[1:56:40] mine hasn't always been beautiful
[1:56:43] i know what living in a broken home is
[1:56:44] about
[1:56:46] blah blah blah
[1:56:49] i don't even want to talk about it
[1:56:51] it's not who i am
[1:56:53] if this elbow problem's not mine if this
[1:56:56] sinus infection doesn't belong to me
[1:56:58] then neither does any of that
[1:57:01] it's not mine
[1:57:02] what man are you talking about
[1:57:04] what little boy are you talking about
[1:57:07] come on
[1:57:09] and they come over and over and over
[1:57:12] again and you realize
[1:57:14] that the pain of their past has become
[1:57:16] their identity
[1:57:20] and if you take that away they'd be
[1:57:22] faceless
[1:57:24] they'd be like a ghost floating around
[1:57:26] they would have no personality
[1:57:28] you wouldn't even recognize them to be
[1:57:30] who they were
[1:57:31] because everything about their life now
[1:57:34] if we were talking about people still
[1:57:35] bound in the world if we were talking
[1:57:37] about people that hadn't met the truth
[1:57:39] of the gospel and the power of the holy
[1:57:41] ghost and the sanctifying power of the
[1:57:42] word you may not help me tonight but
[1:57:44] just remember you don't have to listen
[1:57:45] to me
[1:57:46] for four more services
[1:57:51] sunday week
[1:57:53] but i'm telling you the truth
[1:57:56] some people don't really want the
[1:57:57] freedom they say they do
[1:58:00] because they have nothing to talk about
[1:58:06] need another water somebody please
[1:58:09] thank you
[1:58:10] he's going
[1:58:12] they wouldn't have anything to talk
[1:58:13] about
[1:58:15] they wouldn't even know they have
[1:58:17] nothing to worry about
[1:58:19] they have no excuse
[1:58:22] for their awkwardness
[1:58:24] for who they have become
[1:58:26] i'm telling you what wouldn't you love
[1:58:28] to see
[1:58:29] how many of you would love to see what
[1:58:31] jesus will make
[1:58:32] you if you let him give you the power to
[1:58:35] overcome anything
[1:58:36] whoa
[1:58:38] i don't know how many times through the
[1:58:40] year sister flo i've heard you say i
[1:58:42] wished i wasn't that way i wished i
[1:58:43] wasn't this way i wished i wasn't the
[1:58:45] other way
[1:58:47] i wished i was more like this and more
[1:58:49] like that let me tell you something this
[1:58:51] is a journey
[1:58:53] if everybody worship the same way if
[1:58:56] everybody did it all just the same way
[1:58:58] then we wouldn't get to our places where
[1:59:00] we need to get in christ
[1:59:02] wouldn't you love to see what jesus i
[1:59:05] feel something now
[1:59:06] wouldn't you love to see what jesus will
[1:59:09] make you if you'll take your hands off
[1:59:11] of all those things that have tried to
[1:59:13] overcome you including the pain of your
[1:59:16] past
[1:59:18] well i'm i got i'm wounded uh sunday
[1:59:24] how long will you need to carry that
[1:59:28] if you're going to carry that as long as
[1:59:30] you've carried some of the other you've
[1:59:32] got 30 more years in the wilderness
[1:59:35] you think you're the only one that ever
[1:59:37] gets offended or hurt
[1:59:39] no sir
[1:59:40] this is a church full of people that
[1:59:41] know what it means to be heard and
[1:59:43] wounded and fitted but they meant to do
[1:59:45] it maybe they did
[1:59:48] maybe they did
[1:59:49] would you be willing to forgive them if
[1:59:51] they ask
[1:59:52] did you know you have to forgive them
[1:59:54] regardless
[1:59:55] of whether they ask or not don't let
[1:59:59] those things that you have been through
[2:00:01] become your identity
[2:00:03] wouldn't you love to see what jesus can
[2:00:06] make you look like
[2:00:08] function like
[2:00:10] worship like
[2:00:12] if you'd let that anointing come night
[2:00:14] after night this week and give you power
[2:00:16] to overcome anything
[2:00:18] make up your list and if you feel like
[2:00:20] you've got over one hurdle say lord
[2:00:22] don't forget number two
[2:00:24] i'm bringing number three lord to you
[2:00:28] you say i've got a list of 50 bring them
[2:00:30] all at one time god can handle them let
[2:00:31] me tell you something jesus can handle
[2:00:34] every obstacle
[2:00:35] [Music]
[2:00:36] every hindrance
[2:00:38] i need another one uh what it takes to
[2:00:40] overcome all unbelief
[2:00:42] i want to call the musicians although
[2:00:44] i'm not quite ready for them but i want
[2:00:46] to call them anyway it makes me feel
[2:00:48] better
[2:00:49] paragraph 73 it makes some of you the
[2:00:51] rush of me to feel better 73 i know it's
[2:00:54] late
[2:00:58] we haven't been here yet
[2:01:00] the length of an average college
[2:01:02] football game
[2:01:03] hello
[2:01:07] we hadn't been here yet long enough the
[2:01:08] average braves baseball game
[2:01:11] hello
[2:01:13] come on now
[2:01:16] very few hollywood movies
[2:01:20] are this short
[2:01:23] when god speaks to a man
[2:01:26] he has faith
[2:01:28] and he has ambition
[2:01:30] and he has a purpose
[2:01:33] slow down
[2:01:35] when god speaks to a man
[2:01:37] he gives him
[2:01:39] a purpose
[2:01:41] that's a woman as well
[2:01:43] when god speaks to a man he gives him
[2:01:46] ambition
[2:01:47] this isn't selfish ambition we all have
[2:01:50] to work through all that we have to
[2:01:51] overcome all that i'm talking about what
[2:01:54] god puts in you
[2:01:55] a desire
[2:01:57] to be something for him
[2:01:58] [Music]
[2:02:01] you see we we've been hindered along the
[2:02:02] way because we came out of a background
[2:02:05] where it was more about doing than being
[2:02:11] and so now we struggle because our
[2:02:13] answer our solution is usually i need to
[2:02:16] do more
[2:02:17] i hear the same people saying i need to
[2:02:19] pray more i need to read obama more i
[2:02:20] need to pray more need to read my bible
[2:02:21] more need to pray more yeah
[2:02:24] you do
[2:02:26] so just
[2:02:27] do it
[2:02:33] but don't let the condemnation
[2:02:36] of your slackness
[2:02:38] keep you from receiving another way out
[2:02:43] there's nothing more precious than
[2:02:44] prayer nothing more precious than the
[2:02:46] word
[2:02:47] nothing no more powerful weapon in this
[2:02:49] whole wide world than prayer nothing
[2:02:51] nothing can stand before the word you
[2:02:54] need to read it you need to hear it you
[2:02:55] need to breathe it you need to eat it
[2:02:57] you need to sleep it but it may not be
[2:03:00] reading more
[2:03:02] or praying more to get you over
[2:03:05] it certainly wasn't coming to the altar
[2:03:07] one more time for that woman was it
[2:03:09] it was getting down to business
[2:03:12] do you think let me ask you this do you
[2:03:14] think it takes a cancer diagnosis
[2:03:16] to make a man get down to business
[2:03:19] it should not
[2:03:21] now if we're talking about someone out
[2:03:22] there hardened by sin and unrepentance
[2:03:26] that's a category to itself
[2:03:28] but you people are
[2:03:30] born again of the spirit of god
[2:03:33] and your desire
[2:03:35] is to be
[2:03:38] if you want to do more let him make you
[2:03:40] more
[2:03:41] become more
[2:03:43] more of what god has for you trade your
[2:03:46] ambition for his
[2:03:48] when god speaks to a man watch this when
[2:03:51] god speaks to a man
[2:03:53] he
[2:03:55] gives him faith to do it
[2:04:00] to accomplish or achieve what his
[2:04:02] purpose in life is what god called him
[2:04:05] to do
[2:04:06] oh the church wouldn't let me be what
[2:04:08] god called me to be my family wouldn't
[2:04:10] let me be what god called me to be my
[2:04:12] boss man wouldn't let me be what god
[2:04:14] called me to be
[2:04:18] again that sounds like the message i
[2:04:19] heard growing up
[2:04:24] the devil stole his life
[2:04:26] this is what i heard growing up the
[2:04:28] devil killed him
[2:04:31] you better listen
[2:04:32] some of you won't agree that's your
[2:04:33] prerogative
[2:04:34] i grew up under that kind of a doctrine
[2:04:37] the doctrine that i grew up under was
[2:04:39] placing
[2:04:40] the enemy
[2:04:42] more powerful than his creator
[2:04:45] i don't believe that gospel
[2:04:47] let me go on record tonight i don't
[2:04:49] believe any message
[2:04:51] that puts the devil
[2:04:54] in a greater position
[2:04:58] i recognize that he couldn't even be the
[2:05:00] prince of the power of the air if god
[2:05:02] didn't allow him
[2:05:04] he couldn't be what he is if god didn't
[2:05:06] allow him to be that
[2:05:08] he's a tool in the hand of god to
[2:05:11] perfect the saints if you believe that
[2:05:13] same man then you quit putting your
[2:05:15] hindrance
[2:05:17] above your
[2:05:18] answer quit putting your obstacle above
[2:05:22] your ability to let faith be your
[2:05:25] victory
[2:05:26] you believe that same man
[2:05:28] he said if god gives him faith to do it
[2:05:30] to accomplish or achieve what his
[2:05:33] purpose in life is what god called him
[2:05:35] to do he's called us to be in the church
[2:05:38] of god amen whatever god calls you to he
[2:05:42] will give you the victory that you need
[2:05:44] to press through
[2:05:46] now
[2:05:47] i have to i have to stop
[2:05:51] i'm going to find let me find one more
[2:05:53] thing
[2:05:54] in these 15 pages of note
[2:05:58] let me find one thing
[2:06:01] it's one little section i wanna
[2:06:03] there's so many things that we have
[2:06:05] heard about overcoming but there's one
[2:06:07] little thing lord let me find that
[2:06:09] oh it spoke to me today
[2:06:12] yeah it's long it's a little bit long
[2:06:14] but i got a few more minutes some of my
[2:06:16] good friends are just getting here so i
[2:06:18] got another hour right i appreciate the
[2:06:19] hour brother brent and sister trish god
[2:06:22] bless you
[2:06:23] uh this is in a message called questions
[2:06:25] and answers number four
[2:06:27] and uh it's 1964. it's gonna be way over
[2:06:30] in the in the uh
[2:06:32] document
[2:06:33] and it's paragraph 66 and there's
[2:06:36] several questions here we're gonna we're
[2:06:38] gonna read a little bit slow because i
[2:06:39] want you to see if you can relate to any
[2:06:41] of this
[2:06:42] because this is something that really
[2:06:44] strengthened me
[2:06:46] uh
[2:06:47] question 387 brother branham please
[2:06:50] explain how a person knows if he is
[2:06:52] thinking his own thoughts
[2:06:54] or if the devil is placing thoughts in
[2:06:57] his mind to make him think wrong
[2:07:00] especially if you know you do not want
[2:07:03] to think them period now
[2:07:06] got to pause again
[2:07:08] you see this is the mentality again that
[2:07:10] i was raised under
[2:07:13] that the enemy can just come in and
[2:07:15] inject
[2:07:18] our minds against our will
[2:07:22] he can say whatever he wants to say and
[2:07:24] he can bypass holy ghost
[2:07:27] he can by pass the truth of the
[2:07:28] revelation of his word
[2:07:30] and put thoughts in my head that i have
[2:07:32] no power to overcome
[2:07:34] that's not what i believe
[2:07:37] and that's not what brother branham
[2:07:38] believed
[2:07:39] let's go on
[2:07:40] he said then if it's contrary to the
[2:07:43] word it's the devil's thinking
[2:07:46] if it's with the word it's god thinking
[2:07:49] if it's the wrong thoughts it's the
[2:07:51] devil if it's good thoughts of the word
[2:07:53] and of god it's god's thinking
[2:07:57] now the next question
[2:08:00] 388 he said if the case may be that the
[2:08:02] devil is placing thoughts in your mind
[2:08:04] about a certain thing
[2:08:06] how may it be overcome or got rid of
[2:08:10] good question
[2:08:12] he said take the ver listen to this
[2:08:15] oh i couldn't be this simple
[2:08:18] you mean i could drive the devil out of
[2:08:20] my head
[2:08:23] you mean i have the power by the holy
[2:08:24] ghost to cancel his excess
[2:08:31] access denied
[2:08:33] may god give us a big old flashing sign
[2:08:36] that says your access has been denied
[2:08:41] now watch this he said take the very
[2:08:43] vice versa
[2:08:47] from it
[2:08:49] if the devil makes you think
[2:08:51] that you are if you know you're a
[2:08:53] christian
[2:08:54] and he tries to make you think you're
[2:08:55] not a christian
[2:08:57] just take the versa
[2:09:00] say i
[2:09:02] am a christian
[2:09:05] couldn't be that easy it couldn't be
[2:09:06] that easy couldn't be that easy faith
[2:09:09] faith is the victory that overcomes the
[2:09:11] world
[2:09:12] oh yes
[2:09:14] he said as long as your experience
[2:09:18] matches in god's word say i'm a
[2:09:21] christian
[2:09:22] have you met the requirement
[2:09:25] have you repented and been baptized in
[2:09:26] the name of the lord jesus christ for
[2:09:28] the remission of your sins have you been
[2:09:30] have you been filled baptized with the
[2:09:33] holy ghost and fire
[2:09:35] i didn't ask you if you spoke in tongues
[2:09:37] i ask you if you've been filled with the
[2:09:39] holy ghost
[2:09:40] is your experience a bible experience
[2:09:44] if it is
[2:09:45] then you can absolutely declare without
[2:09:48] a shadow of a doubt no matter how you
[2:09:50] feel or how you feel others feel about
[2:09:53] you
[2:09:56] access to the devil
[2:09:59] i'm a christian
[2:10:00] anything else the same way
[2:10:02] anything else the same way
[2:10:05] anything else the same way
[2:10:07] you win me we're nearly done
[2:10:10] when you see the musicians are up here
[2:10:14] when you answer this
[2:10:16] please pray for me to overcome this
[2:10:20] as i am not
[2:10:22] my
[2:10:23] self
[2:10:28] before the question was over the person
[2:10:31] confessed
[2:10:32] why they're having such a struggle
[2:10:35] it's the whole process of their thoughts
[2:10:38] it's the whole paradigm that they have
[2:10:40] created and he goes on let's keep
[2:10:43] reading just a moment he said god grant
[2:10:46] your overcoming
[2:10:48] ever who you are and here's here's some
[2:10:51] advice may your thoughts just go right
[2:10:53] back to the other side and say i am a
[2:10:55] christian i am a believer satan you have
[2:10:58] no hold on me

[2:11:30] you you didn't choose me
[2:11:33] hallelujah

[2:11:38] figure out who gave it to me
[2:11:41] i know where it come from
[2:11:43] it didn't come to me by the saints
[2:11:45] it came to me by the enemy
[2:11:48] and god gave us the victory
[2:11:52] and he did because you must have said i
[2:11:56] cannot yield
[2:11:59] if it's my time
[2:12:01] i'm going out of here

[2:12:31] fainting right here the pulpit that's
[2:12:32] right four or five times i've almost
[2:12:34] pitched over on the pulpit that's the
[2:12:37] truth

[2:12:50] didn't ever have a problem i don't know
[2:12:51] if he could help me or not
[2:12:53] but here's one that felt fought the same
[2:12:55] battles
[2:12:57] and that's why god came and lived in the
[2:12:59] body of a man because he was gonna fight
[2:13:01] and overcome
[2:13:02] and because he did you did now 389 next
[2:13:05] one
[2:13:06] when a person realizes he has an
[2:13:09] inferior complex
[2:13:13] or some sort of complex and there's many
[2:13:17] there's many syndromes
[2:13:19] and complexes that the enemy will use to
[2:13:22] try to keep you under his
[2:13:25] ugly thumb
[2:13:28] how may he overcome this aren't you glad
[2:13:30] that somebody asked these questions i am
[2:13:33] he said so should it be that he was the
[2:13:35] only child

[2:13:41] an only child
[2:13:45] let me read on
[2:13:47] take
[2:13:48] here's the advice

[2:14:02] able
[2:14:03] to live a normal life
[2:14:06] i've been so broken
[2:14:08] so bruised so wounded
[2:14:11] i don't know how i'm ever going to be
[2:14:12] able to live
[2:14:14] normal nobody should have to live and go
[2:14:16] through the things that i've been
[2:14:18] through
[2:14:21] boy that's encouraging isn't it
[2:14:24] i know you know exactly what i'm saying
[2:14:28] these are the lies that the enemy tells
[2:14:30] us
[2:14:31] because he allowed these things listen
[2:14:33] he's the one that brought him our way
[2:14:34] because he thought i'll use this to take
[2:14:36] you under
[2:14:38] and god says
[2:14:41] i'll take the very same thing and cause
[2:14:44] you to come over
[2:14:46] the thing that the enemy meant to
[2:14:48] destroy you can be
[2:14:50] must be has to be glory be to god the
[2:14:54] very thing that gives you grace
[2:14:59] glory
[2:15:01] to overcome
[2:15:03] praise god whoa
[2:15:07] i think that's just a bunch of emotion
[2:15:09] maybe whoa
[2:15:12] but it sure does feel good
[2:15:14] you thought you had me
[2:15:21] my father rejected me
[2:15:23] the enemy thought that he would use that
[2:15:26] to destroy my life
[2:15:30] dumb devil
[2:15:34] could it yes
[2:15:37] i've stood here in this pulpit
[2:15:39] for many many years now
[2:15:41] and this week celebrated 46 years
[2:15:44] of active ministry
[2:15:46] and i have stood many many times and
[2:15:48] given my testimony
[2:15:50] of how a spirit of lust came down
[2:15:52] through the men in my family and would
[2:15:54] have destroyed my life as a preteen
[2:16:00] but god
[2:16:02] my great grandfather my grandfather my
[2:16:04] father were womanizers
[2:16:07] god redeemed and saved and delivered and
[2:16:09] he is good and he is faithful but that's
[2:16:12] my family truth that's my family truth
[2:16:15] and i would have grown up to have the
[2:16:16] same kind of out of control lust
[2:16:20] that drove every one of them into
[2:16:22] somebody else's bedroom
[2:16:24] while their wives rolled around the town
[2:16:27] looking for them
[2:16:29] and that old same thing began to try to
[2:16:31] talk to me and work on me when i was not
[2:16:34] even quite a teenager and the demons
[2:16:37] spirits came and i don't want to go into
[2:16:38] all that but manifested in my bedroom
[2:16:42] when i was just a boy
[2:16:43] and what did you do i did what anybody
[2:16:45] will do if they get desperate enough i
[2:16:47] rolled out of the bed on my face and
[2:16:49] called out to a god to deliver me of
[2:16:51] something i did not even understand
[2:16:54] i didn't understand
[2:16:55] looking back i know what this was it was
[2:16:58] coming on me generationally i didn't
[2:17:00] know what these thoughts were where they
[2:17:02] came from why these feelings were coming
[2:17:05] over me i didn't understand any of it
[2:17:07] who was i going to ask my old
[2:17:09] gray-headed granny
[2:17:13] was i going to go to my grandmother and
[2:17:14] say big mama
[2:17:17] i don't know where these thoughts are
[2:17:18] coming i don't know why this is coming
[2:17:20] on me let me tell you something in that
[2:17:23] moment there was nobody to go to except
[2:17:24] the one who could do something for me
[2:17:26] i'm telling you my life and i rolled
[2:17:28] over
[2:17:30] and you could stand you could stand you
[2:17:32] could stand got to go
[2:17:34] you could stand and give me the same
[2:17:35] kind of testimony what the enemy meant
[2:17:37] to destroy
[2:17:40] you but you've just got to make sure
[2:17:43] that you don't allow the enemy to hold
[2:17:45] you in a vicious holding cycle
[2:17:47] a holding pattern
[2:17:49] when god's calling you to victory how to
[2:17:51] overcome anything how to overcome
[2:17:53] anything how to overcome anything he
[2:17:55] said take exactly the opposite
[2:17:57] if you're always wanting your way
[2:17:59] whoa
[2:18:01] i was i have i fought that and that one
[2:18:03] little brat that wants to always have
[2:18:05] everything your way turn right back
[2:18:07] around and give everything you got the
[2:18:09] other way
[2:18:11] if you're selfish
[2:18:13] and you want to hold everything then
[2:18:15] start giving away what you got
[2:18:18] now if this was a charismatic conference
[2:18:21] or meeting they they they've got a
[2:18:23] phrase for it they call it moving in the
[2:18:25] opposite spirit
[2:18:27] brother branham had never heard
[2:18:28] terminology like that and he said it's
[2:18:30] just vice versa
[2:18:31] well i know what it means
[2:18:34] first time i heard somebody moving in
[2:18:35] opposite spirit i had to figure that out
[2:18:37] but i knew what it meant when brother
[2:18:39] renner said just take the vice versa
[2:18:41] you just turn that thing around if the
[2:18:43] enemy is trying to bind you with
[2:18:45] stinginess
[2:18:47] you just give your way to victory
[2:18:49] you just say i'm gonna share i'm going
[2:18:51] to give i'm
[2:18:53] not going to let
[2:18:55] if the enemy's trying to make you a
[2:18:57] powder
[2:18:58] you make up your mind you're not going
[2:19:00] to wear your feelings on your sleeves
[2:19:01] anymore
[2:19:05] if the enemy is trying to change and
[2:19:07] and deform your present
[2:19:10] and your future
[2:19:12] because of what you walked through in
[2:19:13] the past why don't you make up your mind
[2:19:17] faith is the victory that overcomes the
[2:19:18] world i'm going to show that dirty devil
[2:19:21] he's a liar
[2:19:22] he said if you're selfish you want to
[2:19:23] hold everything then start giving away
[2:19:25] what you got see do whatever just go to
[2:19:27] vice versa
[2:19:28] that's the way to overcome what
[2:19:31] anything isn't that the theme of this
[2:19:32] meeting how to overcome anything there
[2:19:34] it is it's an antidote
[2:19:36] quit cooperating with a liar
[2:19:39] help me now
[2:19:41] quit cooperating with a liar
[2:19:44] pack up all of his lies
[2:19:47] but you didn't call me devil
[2:19:51] whoa
[2:19:53] you didn't call me he did
[2:19:56] he's going to be the one to get me
[2:19:57] through brother branstad that's the way
[2:19:59] to overcome anything it's an antidote i
[2:20:01] want you to say it's an antidote
[2:20:03] it's an antidote
[2:20:06] let's stand together hallelujah
[2:20:08] hallelujah hallelujah
[2:20:10] praise god
[2:20:11] praise god i don't know what to tell you
[2:20:13] to sing
[2:20:14] i don't know what to tell you to sing
[2:20:17] but sing something in a minute when you
[2:20:19] can when you think of something you
[2:20:21] surely you can think of something
[2:20:23] i believe with all my heart
[2:20:26] that it is more simple
[2:20:29] than what our religious mindset
[2:20:31] likes to make it
[2:20:33] and i think we choose
[2:20:35] to stay in holding pattern
[2:20:38] because we always do listen i'm still
[2:20:40] preaching
[2:20:41] you've just changed positions
[2:20:45] because we choose to always do
[2:20:47] what we've always done
[2:20:52] and if you always do what you've always
[2:20:53] done
[2:20:54] got good news for you
[2:20:55] you'll always be what you've always been
[2:21:01] if you let
[2:21:03] betrayals
[2:21:05] cause you from trusting anybody
[2:21:08] or having any friends
[2:21:10] and you don't turn loose of that and
[2:21:12] give that to the redeeming blood
[2:21:14] of jesus christ you'll never break out
[2:21:16] of that cycle the cycle that the enemy
[2:21:18] meant to destroy you
[2:21:21] god may have a friend for you
[2:21:24] he may have somebody for your life that
[2:21:26] you will not let in
[2:21:28] not because of something he's done or
[2:21:30] she's done
[2:21:31] but because of where you've been doesn't
[2:21:33] that just sound like the devil
[2:21:36] he gets in families like i just
[2:21:37] mentioned and he likes to carry a thing
[2:21:40] all the way through
[2:21:42] but that gets pretty serious when you
[2:21:43] start having children
[2:21:47] that's when you really have to start
[2:21:48] taking god at his word
[2:21:50] because you know your struggles
[2:21:52] you don't want that to go to another
[2:21:54] generation you hear what i'm saying
[2:21:56] i don't know what you're struggling with
[2:21:58] i don't know what you need to overcome
[2:22:01] but i have confidence that you do
[2:22:03] i have confidence that if you'll join me
[2:22:05] this week and make a list of those
[2:22:07] things that you would like to have the
[2:22:08] victory over
[2:22:10] instead of them controlling you you want
[2:22:12] to put them under your feet i believe
[2:22:15] the holy ghost is going to meet us here
[2:22:17] he did he's here tonight i believe he's
[2:22:19] going to meet us here i don't believe
[2:22:21] that brother isaiah brooks is going to
[2:22:22] be able to pack it all up in a suitcase
[2:22:24] and bring it to us
[2:22:26] because he forgot his driver's license
[2:22:28] almost didn't get on the plane he might
[2:22:30] have forgot to put all we need in a
[2:22:31] suitcase
[2:22:33] i'm not making fun of him
[2:22:35] i've been in that kind of stressful
[2:22:37] situation
[2:22:39] but i want you to know it's jesus has
[2:22:40] got it it's in his suitcase
[2:22:42] everything we need
[2:22:44] how many of you are willing to trust him
[2:22:47] i'm not asking you to trust me
[2:22:52] i'm asking you to trust him
[2:22:54] i'm asking you to take him at his word
[2:22:58] i'm asking that you would be willing to
[2:23:00] allow him
[2:23:02] one choice at a time
[2:23:04] one praise at a time to give you victory
[2:23:07] over every obstacle
[2:23:09] if you're a person in here and you've
[2:23:11] only got one
[2:23:13] you're blessed
[2:23:16] because most people i know it's got a
[2:23:17] collection of hindrances and obstacles
[2:23:20] but jesus has an answer
[2:23:22] for every one of them could we worship
[2:23:23] the lord just a moment
[2:23:25] i know it's getting late
[2:23:27] but we want to worship him for just a
[2:23:29] moment and see what the lord will do
[2:23:31] before we close
[2:23:34] hallelujah come on
[2:23:38] praise god you give a life
[2:23:41] you are love
[2:23:44] you bring light to
[2:23:47] the darkness

[2:29:00] so we pour out our praise to you
[2:29:06] just play now
[2:29:09] you may not have had time to make your
[2:29:10] list
[2:29:12] but i want us to pray we're not going to
[2:29:14] call you forward
[2:29:16] i don't want to prolong the evening
[2:29:18] any longer than i already have
[2:29:20] but i mean this i'm serious about this
[2:29:24] i've made my list
[2:29:26] these are things
[2:29:28] that i feel like
[2:29:30] have
[2:29:31] the ability to control me at times
[2:29:33] instead of me controlling them
[2:29:36] and before this meeting is over
[2:29:38] i've asked the lord
[2:29:40] to anoint my faith
[2:29:43] let me lay all of that before him
[2:29:46] and come out of here overcoming anything
[2:29:49] having control over every bit of it
[2:29:52] conquering all of it instead of it
[2:29:53] conquering me now if i need that i'm
[2:29:55] just i'm just taking a risk here but i'm
[2:29:58] pretty sure somebody else needs that too
[2:30:01] the same old samos
[2:30:03] you may not have your whole list but i
[2:30:05] think right now you know of some things
[2:30:08] that the enemy uses to hold you back
[2:30:11] i want you to give them to the lord
[2:30:14] if you're a person that feels like you
[2:30:16] should kneel or need to kneel kneel
[2:30:19] if you're a person that feels like you
[2:30:20] you just about have to come forward come
[2:30:22] forward
[2:30:24] but i'm giving you the opportunity right
[2:30:25] where you are i'm telling you what i'm
[2:30:27] preaching about tonight it can meet you
[2:30:29] right where you stand
[2:30:33] if somebody
[2:30:36] it's risky
[2:30:37] the enemy tries to convince us
[2:30:41] i've tried before
[2:30:42] i've never been able
[2:30:45] we never will be able
[2:30:47] we'll never be able to put it behind us
[2:30:49] but faith is the victory that overcomes
[2:30:51] the world
[2:30:52] jesus in us has power
[2:30:54] to give us victory over anything that
[2:30:56] the enemies use so i want you to just
[2:30:58] stretch your i'm going to do something i
[2:30:59] never do i'm going to ask you to take
[2:31:01] your hands down just a moment it seems
[2:31:03] so crazy
[2:31:04] because as preachers we're always
[2:31:06] telling people raise your hands i'm
[2:31:07] fixing to do that in a minute
[2:31:10] if you're here and you say i i may not
[2:31:12] have my list but i got some stuff
[2:31:14] i know some things that control me
[2:31:16] sometime
[2:31:18] instead of me having control over it
[2:31:21] and i'm willing to give this a try
[2:31:24] because i read i heard i saw what you
[2:31:26] presented tonight and i know it i know
[2:31:28] it i knew it when i come in here
[2:31:30] but i'm willing to get down to business
[2:31:32] brother branham said she kept praying i
[2:31:34] kept praying for it nothing changed but
[2:31:36] when she got that diagnosis
[2:31:38] she got down to business wouldn't it be
[2:31:40] wonderful tonight if you and i just make
[2:31:42] up her mind
[2:31:43] i'm getting down to business
[2:31:45] i don't have to be told i got two weeks
[2:31:47] to live i don't have to be told this
[2:31:49] covet i don't have to be told any other
[2:31:51] i don't have to be tony i'm gonna get
[2:31:53] down to business
[2:31:55] and put my faith i feel something
[2:31:57] it's not about feeling but i feel
[2:31:59] something
[2:32:00] i encourage you and
[2:32:02] and implore you to join me right now
[2:32:06] if you have those things
[2:32:09] and you are willing
[2:32:11] to put your entire trust in god to give
[2:32:14] you victory over them according to his
[2:32:15] word i want you to at least lift up one
[2:32:17] hand you can put up both hands you're
[2:32:19] not lifting it up to say aye
[2:32:22] you're lifting it up to give him
[2:32:24] the acknowledgement to say lord here i
[2:32:27] am willing one more time to do all that
[2:32:30] i can to take you at your word but i'm
[2:32:34] going to need something from you
[2:32:38] because this is not the power of
[2:32:40] positive thinking this is deliverance
[2:32:43] that i need
[2:32:45] this is not a norman vincent peale
[2:32:47] moment this is i've got to have the
[2:32:50] faith
[2:32:51] to take god in his word and i need some
[2:32:53] oil poured on my faith
[2:32:55] so right now while your hands are lifted
[2:32:57] up to him because you're acknowledging
[2:32:59] to him
[2:33:00] you're saying lord i surrender these
[2:33:01] things to you i can't do it without you
[2:33:03] can't do it without you got to have your
[2:33:05] grace i want you to tell him i want you
[2:33:07] to tell him right now you don't have to
[2:33:08] be loud but i want you to tell him here
[2:33:11] they are lord
[2:33:12] here they are right now
[2:33:17] here they
[2:33:18] are i'm tired of them
[2:33:21] controlling me
[2:33:25] when your word gives me the promise
[2:33:28] that they're to be under my feet
[2:33:30] and so i surrender
[2:33:32] all i have all i am all i know i
[2:33:35] surrender that to you and i ask you to
[2:33:37] come lord tonight
[2:33:39] and in the remainder of these meetings
[2:33:42] and pour on me
[2:33:44] the portion that i need
[2:33:46] to get up above everything that is
[2:33:49] trying
[2:33:50] to take me out
[2:33:52] lord i'm asking you right now
[2:33:55] that as we leave here tonight that our
[2:33:57] faith
[2:33:58] will position us
[2:34:00] for whatever you have for us
[2:34:03] thursday night friday night saturday
[2:34:05] night and sunday morning when we come
[2:34:07] together
[2:34:09] deliverance
[2:34:10] is ours
[2:34:12] if we're willing lord
[2:34:13] to put our faith
[2:34:15] into this moment it is a moab it is an
[2:34:18] appointment it is a divine convocation
[2:34:22] you have called us here for such a time
[2:34:25] as this
[2:34:26] and we don't want to walk under the
[2:34:27] burden
[2:34:29] of all that has held us
[2:34:31] we want to move
[2:34:33] in that faith so lord here we are just
[2:34:35] tell him yes
[2:34:38] if you don't want to go into all those
[2:34:39] and say yes lord
[2:34:41] yes it's one decision at a time one
[2:34:44] prays at a time
[2:34:46] he has power
[2:34:48] in you
[2:34:51] to overcome
[2:34:53] anything
[2:34:54] here i am lord i believe you
