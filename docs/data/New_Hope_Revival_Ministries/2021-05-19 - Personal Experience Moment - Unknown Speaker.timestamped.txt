[0:00] it's the blood it's the grace
[0:04] it's having an encounter with the
[0:07] genuine
[0:08] spirit of almighty god
[0:16] [Music]
[0:18] you must be born
[0:22] again you are not born again by
[0:25] information you are born again by the
[0:30] spirit of the living god you can have
[0:33] all the inspiration and all the
[0:36] information
[0:37] and still be lost in your sins
[0:41] you can be religious
[0:44] you can pepper your conversation with
[0:47] hallelujahs and
[0:49] praise the lords and amends
[0:52] and still be as lost
[0:55] [Music]
[0:56] as lost can be you can have your name
[1:01] on every church role in the county
[1:06] and be lost without hope
[1:09] and die and go to hell
[1:14] it's not about being churchy
[1:19] it's not about being religious
[1:25] you know people like to walk around i'm
[1:28] a baptist
[1:29] i'm a pentecostal i'm a roman
[1:33] catholic i'm a this
[1:36] i'm a that i'm a something else over
[1:39] here
[1:40] but i want you to know there are no such
[1:42] a thing
[1:43] as any of that when you step into the
[1:46] kingdom of god
[1:47] it's the blood it's the grace
[1:51] it's having an encounter with a
[1:54] genuine spirit of almighty god
[1:58] come on now it's very very very
[2:02] important
[2:03] what you personally believe amen you've
[2:06] got to have
[2:06] a persuasion that only the spirit of god
[2:10] can give you
[2:11] on what you believe but with that belief
[2:15] and with that faith you cry out
[2:18] to experience the reality
[2:22] of god because if you have all the truth
[2:25] of a message
[2:27] or all the truth of a particular
[2:29] denominational persuasion
[2:31] but you have never encountered
[2:34] a living god if you have never
[2:38] really understood that he is for
[2:42] you he is seeking
[2:45] after you that's what
[2:48] god wants to work out in your life
[2:53] he doesn't want you to have to come to
[2:55] church to hear from him
[2:58] he wants you to have a personal
[3:00] experience with him
[3:02] so that he can lead you every day guide
[3:04] you every day
[3:06] speak to you every day i don't mean like
[3:08] a
[3:09] booming voice it shakes your house
[3:13] god doesn't always speak in an
[3:15] earthquake
[3:16] or a fire oh sometimes he
[3:20] speaks in a still small
[3:23] voice that only a born-again child of
[3:26] god
[3:26] can even hear
[3:32] you
