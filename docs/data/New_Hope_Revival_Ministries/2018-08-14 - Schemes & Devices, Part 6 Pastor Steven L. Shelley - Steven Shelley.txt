our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Christ in you the hope award praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New Hope revival ministries now I want to welcome you to the program today thank you for watching the programs and for responding you've been such a blessing to us we come to you today in partnership with the gospel channel and we want to say again what a great honor and a great privilege it is to be associated with those fine brothers and sisters at the gospel channel it always amazes me that God is using such a small island the island of Iceland and what a mighty effect it's having on the world through the gospel Channel you see there's a number of countries where the gospel channel is reaching out with three different channels forming a powerful network across Iceland across Scandinavia and across Europe we're believing that the Lord is going to make a way to expand that through satellite television into many other nations of the world but we're talking a great number of nations that are already able to pick up the gospel channel on their satellite or on their cable box what a blessing it is but you can also visit you can tell your friends and neighbors who may live a little bit beyond our reach of broadcast you can tell them that they can access the programming of the gospel channel on its website what a beautiful website the gospel channel has and you can access through live streaming you can watch on your computer anywhere in the world and see exactly what others are watching on their television we're thankful for that we believe it's another way that the Ministry of the gospel channel can reach farther and we're thankful that new hope revival ministries gets to be a part of that let me invite you to our website revival dot o-r-g and also we are in the middle of a series on schemes and devices this is program number six in this series you will be able to go to youtube and look up new

at the top on the YouTube channel that says subscribe and then you would be notified of any new material that we add I'm always excited about the many different ways that God is giving us to reach out with the gospel thank you for your prayer requests your phone calls your emails and I want to encourage you to keep it up because we want to pray with you we're partners with you in prayer we believe that God according to the promise of his word desires that we come before him laying our petitions making them known and then standing on the promises of God in faith and watching him work miracles with men things are impossible but with God all things are possible let's get today to the Word of God and to part six in a series of programs schemes and devices we are studying this together because of the scripture that I like to read at the beginning of the of the word portion of our program 2nd corinthians 2:11 lest Satan should get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices based on your comments in your phone calls and in your emails this particular series has been a special blessing to you because I believe what God is allowing us to do is help you to identify some of the ways that the enemy is targeting you in your life I also pray that you're able to identify and to pick up some scriptural tips and learning how to use weapons that God has given us against our enemy so that you're able to stop the enemy in his tracks I'm for God's people I truly believe that the Word of God is right and that it works I don't believe that the Lord wants us to be living in defeat in agony all the time I believe he's giving us a way out through his word he wants us to walk in victory in abundant life no matter what the thief is trying to accomplish in us or through us I truly believe that God's Word has the answers for us in ours in times such as the one we're living in right now at the end of our program together the last time we closed with the scripture Ephesians 4:27 neither give place to the devil in that program we talked about a three-fold strategy for bringing down strongholds in our life those thoughts structures that the enemy likes to build around us so that he can keep using the same method the same trick against us over and over again and in that threefold strategy we found in 2nd Corinthians chapter 10 verse 5 where we are encouraged to cast down imaginations and everything every lofty thought that exalts itself against the knowledge of Jesus Christ number one then number two to bring into captivity every thought we can bring that thought captive we can corral those thoughts together and then force them to be obedient to what God's Word has said this is the absolute truth not the voice in your head not what naysayers are saying about you or against you this is the ultimate truth of who you are those thoughts are not just going to bow to the truth of God's Word you're going to have to around them you're going to have to take authority over them and gather them up and force them to be submitted to the truth of God's Word and then the third part of that strategy was we've got to learn to be obedient to God's Word to live a life of surrender to him so that he can lead us and direct us you know for some people it's a strange thought that a foreign thought that God wants to be involved in their everyday life but I'm here to tell you this is the God of the Bible he's not a God who wants to live ten million miles above us hardly caring about what's going on but he wants to be in us he wants to live through us he wants to be very aware of all of our needs because he is our source our source of strength our source of healing our source of truth he desires to walk with us and to talk with us to be involved in our everyday life religion will deny you of that privilege of relationship but true commitment true intimacy with him Oh to be a friend of God to know that that we are the apple of his eye and that nothing happens to us that catches God by surprise he is ever ready and willing to lead us out of any situation that we find ourselves in in learning to lean on him and in learning to be obedient to the Spirit of God in order for these strategies and tools weapons that God has given us to work we also have to be vigilant we have to make sure that we're not giving the devil any place to climb up to exalt himself in our lives this scripture neither give place to the devil is rendered in the amplified version leave no such room I like that so much leave no such room or foothold for the devil give no opportunity to him in climbing a mountain or in a rock climbing wall you're constantly looking for a higher hand hold a higher foothold a place to put your hand to pull your weight up a place to put your foot to help support you as you gain the the inertia the strength that you need the motion that you need to climb God's word is telling us don't you give the devil a foothold let him find no place in you to be able to so his lies his deceit his seductions and destructions well how do we do that how do we make sure that we're not giving the devil any room in our lives well the easiest way is to be so filled up with God there's no room for the devil the more practical way is to watch your thoughts and watch your emotions at the end of our last program we talked about briefly how the enemy will use our emotions we're emotional creatures and emotions were given to us as a gift by God to enhance our lives not to destroy us our soul Ram the realm of the soul where the mind and the will and the emotions work in itself that is not our enemy God wants to direct all of those areas of our life by the power of the Holy Spirit but when our emotions get stirred in a negative way I'm telling you we can get so confused so caught up in the moment of anger or jealousy or resentment or bitterness or whatever it is that the enemy is slinging against us we can get so caught up in the emotional reaction to what we're going through that we get spiritual amnesia and we forget all the principles that God has made real to us in our life of how to defeat the enemy and how to climb higher in the Lord Jesus Christ your emotions have to be they have to be dealt with they have to be gently led there are times that you have to make a conscious decision I'm not going to yield to the emotion of this moment I'm going to remain rock steady in what God's Word has promised for instance if you receive a bad report from the doctor after having believed God's Word for your healing your emotions of fear and uncertainty doubt can overwhelm you at that moment and cause you to forget all the powerful truths that you've been standing on what you've been claiming what you've been decreeing about God's will desire and power to heal you it seems that we can we can be paralyzed by fear our emotions can pull us in such a way that we just want to lay down and give up that's why we have to learn to watch our emotions in the same manner we're watching over our imaginations and we're pulling our thoughts making them captive so that we can submit them to the truth of God's Word we have to learn at times to be in charge of our emotions to make sure that we don't allow our emotions to pull us out of the place of faith look no matter what the doctor says it doesn't change God's Word the scripture actually says whose report will you believe it's not always easy to choose God's report when our emotions are haywire because we've heard something bad or something negative but it's in that moment that we must ask the Lord for strength that we can be rock-solid standing on the word of truth surrendering to our emotions can hinder our journey by giving the devil a place of opportunity a place to foot put his foot a place to put his hand in our life rather than doing what the scripture said giving him no room giving him no space can you imagine the emotions that were stirred in the soul of Abraham when God told him you must leave your country your kindred your people and sojourn to a land that I will show you he was following an inner voice the voice of a god that he had never seen the voice of a God who had never even revealed his name and yet Abraham took the bold step of faith to be obedient to a voice to leave behind everything that was familiar to him to make this journey and by the way he didn't know at the beginning perhaps just how difficult that journey would be but because of the faith of Abraham through the seed of Abraham the whole world is being blessed today from the nation of Israel comes the most amazing technology for communication or media for medicine for health it's incredible the way that God has blessed that little nation of Israel with such intelligence with such ability in such grace to be able to bless the entire nations of the world did you know that Israel is one of the very first nations to respond to any country when there's a natural disaster did you know they engineer things as simple as bandages that have saved tens of thousands of lives on the battlefields of our world or in natural disasters God has just given a special gift to the seed of Abraham and I'm thankful for it because it's another confirmation of how God's Word works but what if Abraham would have been so called up in grieving over leaving his family his business is kinfolks all that was familiar to him what if he would have allowed his emotions to lead him instead of the voice of his God well I would say things would have been a whole lot different than they are today we have many biblical examples in the scripture where emotions could have gotten the best of somebody but by the gentle leadership of the Holy Spirit they were able to find their strength in the truth of God's Word and victory came because they stood on truth and were led by truth by obedience and not led by their emotions I'll tell you Abraham certainly felt the sting of kissing his human emotions it wasn't all easy for him to move forward and God's destiny plans for his life but he made the right decision as did many many others as with Abraham we have a promise that God will empower us to move beyond our emotions those emotions that attempt to hold us captive I'm telling you you can get caught up in a cycle of grief for instance we know that grief is a gift from God it's a it's a an emotional a mental processing of loss if we didn't have the ability to process loss grief through our emotions we wouldn't be healthy people today God gives us these emotions he gives us these gifts such as grief to be able to process the loss a lot of times we're grieved not for the person especially if they've gone to a better place and we have confidence that they died in faith knowing the Lord we know they're in a better place than the one we're in and we would never call them back but we often grieve for our loss because we loved them because we enjoyed their companionship their fellow ship we are going to miss them and so God gives us this process of grief through our emotions it doesn't look the same for everyone and that's why we have to be very careful when we're judging the way people grieve however grief and the emotions that accompany grief can become a vicious cycle a trap for the children of God what God gives us as an emotional release to help us process the loss the enemy will take advantage of that and he would like to capture us in a cycle of grief that paralyzes us from moving forward in God's destiny plans for our life what do we do we've got to learn to recognize when an emotion when when a process of emotions even a cluster of emotions are causing us to walk in defeat they're causing us to miss out on opportunities that God is giving us to move forward we've got to be able to recognize that and use God's Word as a tool to dig ourselves out of a trap that emotions can sometimes set for us in our lives I believe God will empower you to get out of that trap if you recognize anger is another vicious emotional cycle I am Telling You anger in itself is not a sin in fact the Bible tells us be angry and sin not let not the Sun go down on your wrath what that's really saying to us is it's all right not to like a situation it's alright to even be angry at a situation we have to be careful at becoming angry at people because it can consume us but it's alright to be angry at a situation it's also alright at times to be angry with people Jesus was quite angry when he saw his father's house being turned into a place of exchange and he turned over the money tables because they were not only offering a service as they thought but they were actually cheating and squeezing the people and it was not pleasing to Jesus at all and so he dealt with it in the manner that we read about in the scripture so all these things can be healthy in in their place and in their proper balance but anger is a cycle that you can get caught up in and you can be so angry with every situation with every person in your life that you just become angry for no reason for no cause that emotion of anger can so take hold of your life that you become wicked in your plans wicked in your thoughts always lashing out and when that no longer satisfies well you read the newspapers you know what can happen when someone cannot break free from a cycle of being angry at first it's angry for a reason and then it becomes an entire takeover of your life jealousy the same way we often compare our lives with the with the lives of others and sometimes that provokes a little bit of jealousy in us but we just like anger we pull that down before the end of the day we just submit that to the truth of God's Word if you feel that little you know green-eyed monster of jealousy rising up in you and in a non-productive way you just pull that down and you just submit that to God's Word and you just say Lord I've learned that in whatever state I am in to be up to be blessed to be satisfied to be content because you you sit above it all and you'll take care of it all but if you allow that jealousy to continue to stew and build and express itself in your life it can take over and you can be consumed with not only jealousy but bitterness and envy and strife and anger it goes on and on so one of the things that we have to watch out in the devices and schemes of the enemy is he seeks to whip up our emotions to stir them up in a non healthy and productive manner how do we deal with that well we come back to God's Word we find where our peace comes from our peace is not the absence of turmoil or situations in our life that are that are less than perfect peace is knowing God peace is trusting in Jesus Christ he is our peace and when the enemy comes to disturb our peace in whatever manner and with whatever emotion he chooses we have to make that conscious decision come back to rest come back to peace come back to trust we have a great big God who is sitting above it all and who is more than able to see us through no matter what the enemy has in store for us and there is a unseen hand a great hand of God that's both guiding us and protecting us so one of the ways that we keep the enemy at bay and we keep our emotions in check and we don't allow the enemy to get a foothold or to get space in our life is to renew our minds we can keep our emotions in control we can keep our even our imagination and thoughts and control we can keep a lot of things in proper balance and order in our life through this gift that God has given us the grace to renew our minds the enemy cannot get ahold of us if we are consistently renewing our minds with his word the Word of God and endeavoring to walk in the perfect will of God this renewing process is just that it's a process it's not an automatic behavior automatic action reaction it's not a one sin for all one time thing settled never have to be troubled again the renewing ing the renewing of the mind is indeed a process is a grace it is a gift from God and we need to begin to try to get a hold of that truth and practice it put it into action in our lives the Bible tells us in Romans chapter 12 verse 2 and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by what the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God did you know that God has a good will for you an acceptable will for you and a perfect will for you but the enemy desires to use your emotions to stir you so that he can pull you out of God's good perfect and acceptable will for your life he wants you to be spinning around in a tornado of emotions and that's why God has given us according to the instructions of the Apostle Paul here he's given us the Grace and the ability to renew refresh actually it's a recreation of the mind it's that powerful of a transformation remember that before it tells us how to renew our mind it says we must not be conformed to this world we must understand as believers we're citizens of another world we've come from eternity by the grace of God and we must not become conformed to this world I'm telling you when we start adjusting to the world around us instead of standing up for truth we're on a dangerous slope of destruction you are not created for such a time as this to follow the fat and the fashion of the world around you the world around us is moving toward insanity but God has a royal race he has a holy people on planet Earth for such a time as this who will not be conformed to the image of the world that that word conformed is an interesting concept it's for instance maybe you have some of you have have have seen or maybe even participated in a in an art or a craft where a mold is formed and then you pour for instance hot wax I remember when I was a small child and and my grandparents took me to a to an amusement park in Florida that was that was based around animals and beautiful gardens and I remember that one of the fun things to do was there were machines that you could drop a coin in and a mold would come up in the machine hot wax would be poured down into that mold and in a few minutes that mold would open up and down would drop some kind of little figure I remember I certainly don't have it anymore but I remember a bird I remember the coin going in that machine in the mold opening up the wax being poured in red hot wax poured in the mold the mold closed in the machine a few minutes later it opened up and out dropped this little bird for a souvenir this is this is the concept of the word conformed we're not to take on the form of the world around us we're not to be shaped by the things around us I believe God's speaking to somebody right now and I hope you'll have an ear to hear this it's the enemy's design and desire for our lives that we would take on the shape of the world around us that we would feel the pressure to be like the world around us but here's what the scripture said be not conformed to this world do not take on the form of the world but listen but be what transformed this is a word similar to metamorphosis where a total change takes place that little caterpillar it has a complete meltdown so to speak he spun his cocoon he's hanging there in that cocoon and and the original elements of his body begin to liquefy can you imagine you talk about being under pressure that little worm that little caterpillar in the cocoon it becomes so warm and there and the process of his change becomes so serious that it begins to break down the physical form of that caterpillars body and in the safety of that cocoon his form begins to change it's a process so is our process of transformation our change our transformation is also a process I don't know about you but I can get really impatient when I know a work of changes taking place in my life but not fast enough we've got to learn to trust the hand of God and the timing of God and know that whatever you're going through at this moment it's hand-picked it's chosen God knows you better than you know yourself and he allows the circumstances of our situations to squeeze us to warm us to the place that we begin to break down in our original form and instead of being conformed to the mold of the world around us inside of the cocoon of the anointing we are being changed it is a metamorphosis it is a transformation and one day that cocoon of safety begins to open up because something on the inside wants to come out and if you've been blessed enough to see this new creature emerging from the cocoon I have we have a butterfly center not too far from our home and I've seen with my own eyes the the amazing beauty of God's creation what was such an ugly green worm eating every leaf in sight has now become a new creature I tell you there's not much to identify in the butterfly that was like the caterpillar it's been a total transformation a total metamorphosis and this is what happens to us when we learn the grace of renewing our minds we are changed we are transformed we have a metamorphosis from the inside out and we can become that new creature that no longer has to crawl around in the lower elements of the earth but we're now set free with wings to soar to be free because old things have passed away behold all things have become new for you are a new creation you are a new creature in Jesus Christ so this renewing of the mind is a very powerful gift from God because it Grace's us with the ability to change our attitude to change our thought process to change our emotional life from the inside out let me read that to you in the amplified it says do not be conformed to this world this age fashioned after and adapted to its external superficial customs but be transformed be changed by the entire here that entire all by the entire renewal of your mind by its new ideals and its new attitude God has a new attitude for you he has a new mindset for you he wants to change the frame of your mind and help you to walk in submission to his perfect will he wants you to be able to control your emotions and thoughts instead of your emotions and thoughts controlling you if we can learn some of these very simple processes some of these simple methods that God has outlined for us in the scripture we can defeat the devil no matter what scheme no matter what device he chooses to use against us at any given time let me finish reading this in the amplified fashioned after and adapted to its external superficial customs that's being conformed to the world but be transformed be changed by the entire renewal of your mind by its new ideals and its new attitude so that you may prove for yourselves what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God even if the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect in his sight for you even the thing which is good which is acceptable which is perfect in his sight for you the last time we were together we talked about a three-fold strategy for tearing down for breaking down strongholds I want to I want to close our program out today with this process maybe you could call it another three-fold process that is involved in the renewing of the mind maybe it'll break it down and make it a little bit easier for you and you can maybe jot it down and remember if you miss anything in any of our programs you can go to youtube and find our channel there and go back in and catch any scripture or any point that you might be interested in but the process yes of renewing our mind involves three steps number one we must be willing to change that sounds so simple it is simple but it's not automatic because even though we may be caught up in the swirl of a heavy trial or a dark time in our life we think most of the time we do it right we know what's best we've got it right we've got to be willing to say Lord what I'm doing is not working and I'm willing to change my approach I'm willing to change my thought process I'm willing to change my stubborn will alright and submit myself to what you have for me in this particular moment in this particular hour in order to be willing to change you've got to be willing to accept the fact that you may not be right that you may not have been handling the situation in the right manner in the first place and you've got to be willing to submit your will to the good the perfect and the acceptable will of God and quite honestly my will may not be the Lord's will I might have to come to a place in my life where I'm able to recognize that his way is the right way the best way his will is the right will the best will oh how sweet it is when we are able to recognize and identify that we're in the will of God that our will has come into agreement with his will I'm telling you that's the happiest season in life to know that we're doing the perfect will of God I was recently in a service on Sunday night in the hills of Virginia where I was asked to speak after the Sunday morning service I was asked to travel an hour to speak in a little country church among people that I love very very much my physical body was screaming no my emotions were saying I am too tired to drive that distance and to preach but something in my heart was saying it's wonderful to be wanted it's wonderful to be called on and it's wonderful to have fellowship with people that we love and if not had that opportunity to fellowship with in so long and so I agreed reluctantly to go and I struggled a little bit with my preaching because I was tired my mind wasn't as sharp as I really wanted it to be but when the time for prayer came and the anointing of the Lord was present for just a few moments you know sometimes it's ever so brief that we feel it but for just a few moments I realized that I was standing in the perfect will of God for that moment sorry there's no greater feeling I could have been you know in fact I told the family and friends my plans for Sunday afternoon there was no service in the church where we were visiting and my plans were to go to the pastor's home and sit in one of those big rocking chairs on his porch and watch the Sun go down over those beautiful Virginia mountains that's what I wanted there wasn't anything wrong with that it wasn't it wasn't entirely selfish I don't think because God wants us to have rest at times and he wants us to have the desires of our heart but that and I believe God would have allowed me that but it wasn't his perfect will for that evening and so off we go well there were several car loads of us that went and we had our rooftop carrier on the top of the vehicle and no luggage in it our luggage was in the hotel and so we're getting on the interstate we forget about that that it's empty and when it's empty sometime the wind can make it make a terrible racket sounds like it's gonna rip right off the top and we had to drive an hour on the interstate like that with that thing just jerking around and making such a racket and get on our nerves and you know given your stress but all of that was worth it it was really no sacrifice at all but if there would have been a sacrifice if there if there would have been a price to pay it would have all been worth it for that few moments when God was moving through the little ministry that he's given us and he was blessing God's people and the look on the pastor's face and the happiness and the joy that was in his heart to see his people being ministered to all of that combined with that few minutes of knowing I'm in God's perfect will for this moment there's not a higher joy than that I could have been speaking to thousands of people and not have felt that joy of knowing in that little country church I was in the perfect will of God for that moment I'm telling you that to encourage you to let you know there is that moment for you there is that moment for you you may have not had that sense in a long long time that you were in the perfect will of God because the enemy has been fighting you and frankly sometimes he's been winning against you but God's using our time together I truly believe he's using our time together to help you to be more aware that you would not be ignorant of the devil's devices but that you would be very aware of the ways that the enemy is working against you and that you would take up the sword of the Spirit that you would take up the weapons that God has given you and the whole armour of God and you would begin to defeat the enemy one situation at a time well that would be my greatest desire and there are times in this program and in this setting that I have a small sense of that of that same feeling that I was describing a moment ago right now there are other things I could be doing and sometimes I feel should be doing but all for that moment of knowing that for this moment I'm doing exactly what God would have me to do there's no price tag a moment like that is in valuable and I want to encourage you to keep reaching for that keep working through the processes that goddess is giving you in your life and pull those emotions into check and allow your mind to be renewed that you would not be conformed to this world but that you would indeed be transformed by the renewing of your mind three steps in this process number one we must be willing to change number two we must present ourselves to the Lord as sacrifices as offerings unto God in holiness we've got to be willing to say Lord all that I am everything I hold is because of you and I want to offer back to you the blessing the giftings the graces that you have given to my life I want to offer them back to you as praise as little as they seem sometime as insufficient as I feel sometime I want my mind to be renewed because I'm learning to be willing for change to be willing to change and I am desiring to present my body as a living sacrifice in Romans chapter 12 we read verse 2 but in Romans chapter 12 verse 1 here's where this where this idea comes from it comes right out of the same chapter he said I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice all that I am all that I can accomplish all that I do let it be done unto you and for your glory I believe that if we were constantly aware that our life is an offering to God we would be a whole lot more careful about how we live our lives I truly believe that is a fact by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service one translation of that last phrase of that verses which is the least that you can do hasn't he been so good to us hasn't God been so good to us in our lives 50 years of life here on this planet and I can tell you God has been so good to me why wouldn't I want to live my life as an offering unto Him it's easy to be conformed by your circumstances to this to this image of wanting to just do things your way it's it's easy to become that kind of a person well I've done this so long I'll just do it the way I've always done it but God wants us to be pliable he wants us to be moldable tender in his service sensitive to hear his voice because what if God has something new for you what if God wants to lead you in a new direction with a new path with a new place of authority what if God wants to release you into a new mission field if he wants to call you into a place that's unfamiliar to you and you like Abraham have to leave behind some familiar things to step out in obedience you'll only be able to do that to find the grace to say yes to do that by constantly yielding to the process of renewing your mind so we must be willing to change we must present our bodies ourselves as offerings as sacrifices holy and acceptable unto God and number three we must not be conformed or fashioned to this world which we talked about in the beginning of that verse taking on the mold or the shape of the world around us I want you to know God's Way may may not be the average way it may not be the most pop it may not be what some people would call the normal way but it's the right way God's way is the right way and to discover God's Way to not be led by our emotions or led by our circumstances we have to walk in that's in that place of allowing the Holy Spirit to renew our minds we absolutely do in all three of those steps to be willing to change to to make up your mind I'm going to present my life and my body to God as a sacrifice as an offering for his glory and to refuse to be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of our mind all three of those steps or stages are dependent upon us becoming saturated in the Word of God one of the first series that we did when we started doing these programs in partnership with the gospel channel was taking God at His Word the importance of God's Word in our everyday life and how the truth of God's Word helps us to deal with every measure of unbelief that's in us and I just encourage you to let God's Word work mightily in you God's perfect will in our lives is most often revealed to us by the Word of God or in the Word of God I truly believe it's a road map for life by eating God's Word daily our minds then become fashioned and shaped into his will his way we come into perfect agreement with God's perfect will in our lives and that happens by daily feasting on God's revealed word it it causes our desires to be holier sharper more perfect it deals with our will it causes us the deal with the issues of the soul it helps us to lay our our mind down and take on the mind of Christ that daily consistent faithful prayerful washing of our lives with the Word of God is so powerful in learning to walk in victory and to walk in great success when it comes to recognizing and defeating the schemes and the devices of the enemy so when we need to know God's will we find it by searching God's word allow the Holy Spirit to take that word and speak to your spirit man I'm telling you I've seen God do amazing things in in directing his people by and through his word bypassing that mind will and emotions stuff and getting right into the inner spirit man I'm telling you that's where the new creature is that's where the new creation is working his way from the inside out word that's Christ in you being formed in you the hope of glory working the life of Christ from the inside out oh what a what a joy that truly is when we understand that and remember it on a daily basis as a result of searching God's Word and washing ourselves in God's Word a new identity begins to emerge we begin to see who we really are in Christ in fellowship in relationship with him and just knowing who we are just discovering this new identity that is found in him it gives us power it empowers us to be able to take our Authority and see the devil defeated in any strategy that he desires to use against us and as each and every stronghold in our lives is pulled down what we're actually doing is to throning Satan remember we talked about in an earlier part of this series the city where Satan's seat was and what it means to give the devil a place to sit space in our lives foothold our stronghold in our life when we give him a seat means we surrender our authority to him and he becomes the ultimate authority in our life and I'm telling you he will whip you he will direct you he is a slave driver the enemy once he gets you into his into his captive hand he will he will work you to death he will drive you until you are bankrupt and you have nothing left and that's why we must not surrender our authority to the enemy it's why we must find our new identity in Christ through the word and allow our minds to be renewed as each stronghold in our life is pulled down we did thrown Satan from his seated position of authority in that particular area of our lives is it an addiction is it a habit it's at a family matter do you feel like you're caught up in a generational thing that you can't break free of one by one allow the Holy Spirit to direct you with your weapons with your tools to pull down strongholds until ultimately the devil has nowhere to sit over your life he is de throned and when that begins to happen that's when that new identity in Christ really begins to explode in us and it changes the way we think and it changes the way we speak the reason why we've got to get our thoughts right is because we've got to get our confession right it's very very important the throning Satan is an individual responsibility I can't take him off his throne in your life if I have a throne in my life where he sits you can't take him off of the throne in my life it's an individual responsibility but the atmosphere of deliverance can be a corporate expression we can come into a service where the Spirit of God is moving and their strength in the unity of the Brethren and we that's a great opportunity to call out to God for what you have need of when we all come into the house of God with our licks of fire and the anointing is increased because we come together in one purpose that is a great opportunity to begin to confess the truth of God's Word over your life and to let the devil know I'm on to you I'm onto your schemes I'm learning the way you have worked in my life and buddy your days are numbered your throne over my head is about to come down and I'm going to walk in the victory that the Lord Jesus has given me and once we do throw in the enemy from our personal lives we can to throne him in our families in our churches and our businesses even sometimes over our communities and our regions but it always starts with a personal victory it always starts with a de throwning of Satan in your own life I'm talking to believers I'm talking to children of God born again of the Spirit of God and yet we have yielded and we have allowed the enemy to build the stronghold this death structure this throne over us it's time to kick him off the throne and allow the Lord Jesus Christ to rule and reign again from the inside of the inside of your being that's his desire father I ask you right now in the mighty exalted name of the Lord Jesus Christ take these Bible truths Lord I believe that everything I've been teaching in this series is based solidly on the Word of God and I'm counting on that because I know the power that we have by the Word of God and I'm asking you right now to quicken these truths into individual lives that we might apply the Word of God in every situation to see the enemy defeated every stronghold broken and to see Satan cast off of every throne that he has built that you by the Holy Spirit would come and rule and reign from the Ark of the Covenant of our own spirit man that you would come and sit on the throne that we're building for you on the inside of the inside of who we are that is our desire Oh God grant that right now we pray in the mighty name of Yeshua our Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ I believe there's victory for you I believe there's victory in you if Jesus lives in you then victory is living in you it may seem a little contain consuming or a little bit of effort involved here in pulling some of these things down I agree you're right it takes a little effort it takes a little labor it takes a little faith but all my the benefits are well worth the time the benefits of knowing that Jesus is exalted in your life that your mind is being renewed and that you are going forward with the whole armor of God in your life to defeat the enemy so that we're not always playing the defense the enemy makes a move and we scramble around trying to to counter-attack brother it's time for that little remnant bride of Jesus Christ to rise up on the offense and take territory that the enemy has occupied in our own lives in our families and in our communities and churches for much too long thank you so much for being a part of this study and we have a couple of more sessions to go and I hope you'll stick with us I'd like to see you coming forth with the victory that God has actually allotted and determined for you for such a time as this pray for the gospel channel and send your prayer requests will be happy to pray with you god bless you bye bye for now [Music] [Applause] [Music]
