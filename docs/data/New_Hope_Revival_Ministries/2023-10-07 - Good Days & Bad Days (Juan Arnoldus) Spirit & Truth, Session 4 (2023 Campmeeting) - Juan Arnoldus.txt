in Praise amen hallah oh bless blessed be the Lord blessed be the Lord amen you may be seated Glory Glory Glory Glory praise the name of the Lord we so excited to be in the house of the Lord amen I greet each and everyone in the beautiful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen in Matthew 17 when uh Peter saw on the mountain trans Transfiguration yes when he saw the glory of the Lord yes he saw how Jesus changed and he saw Elijah and Moses the Bible said Peter said Lord it's good to be here amen and I don't know about you amen I feel I'm it's good to be here I like to shout and say lord it's good to be part of this camp meeting amen now praise the Lord now I don't know if that was the Feast of Tabernacles because he wanted to build three Tabernacles for Jesus Moses and Elijah amen so I don't know if it was the Feast of Tabernacles but if it was the Feast of Tabernacles amen he said it's good to be here and we are gathering here at the Feast of Tabernacles and I'm telling you it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen praise the name of the Lord amen so excited I never thought that I'm going to preach tonight again amen I'm little bit tired but Pastor Sally said I'm not here on a holiday amen I'm here to work for Jesus praise the name of the Lord um we don't run for pulpits uh we came to be a blessing we never thought that we're going to preach or minister to the word of God but I'm so thankful for the opportunity and the privilege that we have and I realize when you speak to God's bride this is a elected lady God don't trust anybody to just speak to his bride that's right you have to qualify to speak to his bride cuz she's a special lady that's a truth amen if you don't know that's why the Bible said you you got to to rule your own house right before you can rule the house of God that's right and if you don't know how to treat your own wife at home right you don't qualify to speak to God's bride right the way a man will treat his wife that's the way he will treat his church amen is it right praise the name of the Lord so not everybody or anybody can just come and speak to the Bride of Jesus Christ the Old Testament opens with the serpent greeting the Bride of Adam death came right but the New Testament opened with the angel Gabriel coming to the Bride of Joseph and life came amen and that's what we want amen we don't want serpents to greet the bride we want the angels of the Lord to greet the bride is that right amen are you not glad that the seven Angel yes sir came in this day to greet the Bride of Jesus Christ Shalom oh my that's what we want brother and sister and you know what Gabriel told uh the bride Mary he said fear not you know why because there's certain Angels you need to fear right there's fallen angels that the bride needs to fear but when this Angels Came he said Mary there's no need to fear and we want God to send angels from his throne to speak to the bride so that the bride don't need to fear but that the Bride Can Have Faith amen is that right praise the name of the Lord so we so excited amen and and and what we need we need to hear from the angels of God and we want the angels of God to speak to his bride amen I don't know if you believe it but God still got some angels on the earth if you read Genesis 28 the Bible doesn't say the Angels descended and ascended the Bible said when Jacob saw the Angels they were ascending and descending that's right so they were not Heavenly Angels they were Earthly Angels because Heavenly angels will come from God down amen but Earthly Angels God have on the earth that goes up to the throne to get a message right and then comes down with thus sayeth the Lord and we need those angels amen and that's why David called it God God told Jacob Jacob called it the house of God Beth right amen because that's what we need in the house of God we need Angels brother said a local Pastor is the Angel to the church and God will reveal to the angel the situation and the conditions and the that angel will preach according to the need of the people that's how you know that that man is an angel from God if he can pick up the needs in the church and preach amen Faith to the people praise the name of the Lord you know we not every preacher produce Faith right on Romans chapter 10 says faith cometh by hearing and no man can hear without a preacher right and a preacher cannot preach unless is sent am so not any preacher can give you Faith right don't just run for any preacher the Bible says a sent preacher produce faith and what we need we need faith in this day we need preachers that can preach Faith to the people is that right praise the name of the Lord amen so we are really excited and I want you to understand that in God's Eden he found the serpent but I like when Mary went to the to the go in the graveyard she found the Lord Jesus who's our Shepherd you see some will find in the garden a serpent he found the serpent but Mary found the shepherd so the serpent came in God's Eden but the shepherd came to Satan's Eden oh my oh my God and I'm telling you God is about to send some angels to Satan's Eden so that the bride can hear from God my mind praise the Lord now watch here the devil came to God's Eden uhhuh and in God's Eden he put a man full of sin and he put sin on man and God hates sin and God had to God had to push Adam and Eve out of the garden because that was a perfect Eden right and God said listen Satan you came to my Eden and you placed a man of sin in my Eden but I'm coming now to Satan's Eden and you and I'm I'm going to go to your Eden and you're going to find a sin L man and Jesus said who can condemn me of sin you came to my Eden and you polluted my Eden you polluted Adam's bride but in the end time in Satan's Eden I'll put the Virgin Perfect Bride there oh I'm telling you the devil is in trouble amen the devil is in trouble amen praise God but I'm so excited I'm so excited amen and I want to tell you the coming of the Lord is very close the coming of the Lord is very close in fact the year 2023 is uh this church age right now in 2023 this church age since 196 up till today if you count it it's 117 years and the first church age is also 117 years that's right and brother Brenham said this church age should be the shortest yeah but now we are standing equal with the first church a was since 50 53 ad I think it's uh till 170 if you count it it's 117 years that's how long the E the Ephesus Church was the church a but Luda should be shorter brother B said so we are now equal with the first church AIDS and I'm telling you the coming of the Lord is close this year we are standing exactly on the same amount of years that the first age is old yes so it tells me the coming of the Lord is very close right and this year 2023 is also the 9th anniversary after the prophecy at the Ohio River we he said your message will for on the second coming in that happened we know when it happened is it right 1933 and if you count it up till today it's 90 years now you may say brother what does that mean everybody talks about Abram was 100 years old but the Bible says Sarah the bride was 90 years old when the promised son was born so can it be that we are getting close to the coming the season of the coming of the [Music] Lord oh my even the Rabbi says in 2023 before Christ they said Abram was called out of Babel oh my and Abram was 75 years old and here Israel is also 75 years old so we we are exactly on the same spot where God called Abram out to go into the promised land can it be that from this year we will see the promise of God coming to pass brother the coming of the Lord is drawing nigh Hallelujah and brother says you got to pinch yourself and know the coming of the Lord is here right there in in Daniel chapter 10 there was a delay to the to to to Daniel's prayer then Daniel was praying but there was a delay to the answer of his prayer oh and Michael had to deal with the delay and the Bible said on the 21st day Gabriel only came through but David said on the first day I've heard your prayer and I was sent oh but there was a battle in the atmosphere and there was a delay of 21 days and we are living in the 21st century and Michael dealt with the delays oh my and it's amazing that's Daniel 10 when you go to Revelation 10 in Greek the word that says where the angel said time shall be no more means without delaying of time oh my so here Michael had to deal with the delaying of time in Daniel 10 but right here in Revelation 10 under the seventh seal a mighty Angel comes down to deal with the delaying of time brother B says the coming of the Lord is overdue right there's been a delay yes Matthew 25 says that they Jesus tell it to come so he should have came but he te it there was a delay right right but here the angel comes down put his foot on the land and sea and he says time no more without delaying of time amen oh brother I'm getting excited what do you mean delaying of time there's certain prophecies that needs to come to pass right but there's a delay right there's certain promises that needs to come to pass pass but there's a delay how many promises dreams visions and prophecies God gave to the bride but there's a delay but the mighty Angel is coming down to deal with those delays oh there's going to be no more delays to the Visions no more delays to the bride's promises all the prophecies over your life all those dreams all everything God revealed to you I'm telling you there will be no more delay amen it's going to come to pass no more delay that angel is about to deal with every delay that the devil is trying to put there there's going to be no more delays you better believe it because there's some promises and prophecies we've been waiting and trusting God but I'm telling you now is the season for God to come and bring that to pass praise the name of the Lord but amen I believe I've got a word for you tonight praise God Amen I believe I I was burdened since yesterday when Pastor sh told me you going to preach again I said no I need time to restore I need time to heal I I feel I feel I feel very tired he said no no no no brother you need to preach so I was you know if you're really end time preacher you should be like the Book of Malachi that's a type of the end time right now many people don't even know Malachi have seven letters in his name the same like with William brandham and he was the last prophet of the old Testament so he was the last prophet of the Old Testament that had seven letters in his name and here God sent us the last prophet to the Gentiles with seven letters in his name and Mal Malachi means my messenger so here God sends a messenger his last messenger in the Old Testament that had seven letters in his name and here we have our last prophet messenger that also have seven letters in his name and the numerology in in in in Malachi's name is 47 and brother brenham's Ministry actually started in 1947 that's it you see god is perfect oh god is perfect God Is So Perfect amen um but the coming of the Lord is very very very close amen and we should know that amen this is the season this is the time but I have a word to encourage you and I want to say this also that every real preacher will always be burdened amen every sickness that the people carried when brother touched the people it came on his hand there was a burden that came from the people on him a real true end time messenger or preacher or five-fold Minister will always carry a burden for the people so when you preach You Preach under the burden of the Lord that's why Malachi chapter 1 says the burden of the word of the Lord came to Malachi and Malachi is a is a type of an end time preacher amen so you could last night I couldn't sleep I was rolling around because you know I take I take it very serious and even today I wanted I tried to rest and but gy said you get some rest I said I Tred to rest but after this I'm telling you even on a way back home I told Brother gy gy uh um I said I must preach again he said yeah yeah brother you need to preach I said but listen brother B said he says the bride will have a short quick work and they and they will be out so I'm just going to go quickly behind the poopet and I will be out because a short quick work and now we out he said no no you don't do that brother you don't do that you don't do that so I'm trying I'm going to try to make up so can we stand for the reading of God's word out of respect um I don't want you to stand too long but I there's something I want to also touch here we're going to go to Ecclesiastes 7 verse4 Ecclesiastes 7 verse 14 I first going to read it in the King James version if it's okay and then I'm going to read it in the message uh um version but before I oh I see both they got both on day thank you sister what I want to say about this scripture is Ecclesiastes 7:14 um this scripture is so connected to Triple 7 because 14 is two sevens right so East 7:14 is actually 7 right and I don't know if you know but God is a god of his numbers and you got to understand the numerology of God so the coming of the Lord is in Triple 7 but the coming of the Antichrist is in the triple right and I preached a few months ago on the tri six scriptures in the Bible and where triple six verses connects to the triple six the an the mark of the beast the Antichrist let me give you an example I so I preach the coming of the Lord or the verses the triple six verses is connected to the coming of the Antichrist and the triple six verses is connected to the coming of the Lord so I want you to see this let me make an example if you look at Ephesians 6:12 it speaks about principalities and demons principalities and demons Ephesians 6:12 if you take 12 it's two sixes so six and 12 gives you 666 and there you can see see demon Spirits which are definitely connected to the Antichrist right demon Spirits operating under that triple 6 scripture I hope you see it right and if you also read the seal it's Revelation 6 verse2 again right where the where the tribulation will start and that is also 666 so you can see how these verses the Triple 6 verses reveal the work of the Antichrist and even the Triple 7 Isaiah 7:14 says a virgin shall conceive amen and there you see how Christ come through the Triple 7 scriptures of vers how can it be is a coincidence that it's Isaiah 7:14 a virgin will conceive so Christ came through that Triple 7 and that's the coming of the Lord and I want you to see it and there also let me give you another one in Genesis 531 Noah's father died lamech died at the age of 777 years and then the Bible said and Noah and Noah is a type of the coming of the Lord right so you can see right through the Bible I took many scriptures out of the Bible and verses to prove to you how under the triple six the Antichrist will come but how under the Triple 7 Christ is coming the devil have a number God also have a number right and I want you to see that but wisdom reveals both right the wisdom of God is connected to the first coming and the wisdom of God is connected to the to the revealing of the Antichrist right I want you to see that right because the Bible said the first time he came wise men Came To Worship Him so can you see wisdom connected to the coming of the Lord and in Matthew 25 there's five wise virgins and that's connected to the second coming and I believe even to the third coming there's wisdom that's connected to it but that's why also you need wisdom so wisdom reveals the coming of the Lord and the wisdom of the Lord also reveals the Antichrist I want you to see it because Revelations 13:18 here is wisdom let him that have understanding count the number of the Beast and it's 666 and if you read about Solomon God gave Solomon wisdom and Solomon's salary was 666 talents of gold so you can see how wisdom is connected to revealing the coming of the Lord and the revealing of the Antichrist amen but I let me read the scripture this is a Triple 7 scripture if you can go to it let me read it first in the King James version if it's okay in the days of prosperity be joyful but in the day of adversity consider God also had set the one over against the other to the end that man should find nothing after him but if it's okay I want to read it in the MSG version on a good day enjoy yourself on a bad day examine your conscience God arranges oh my God God is in control God is in control of your days yes sir your good and bad days God is in control the devil don't have a say right God says God arranges for both kinds of days so that we won't take anything for granted brother you can never appreciate a good woman if you don't see a bad woman right is that right praise the name of the Lord can we close our eyes with a word of prayer father I come to you thank you Lord Oh by Revelation Hallelujah knowing that you are the Lord Jesus Christ Lord and I'm coming to speak to your bride tonight Hallelujah but Lord may your Holy Spirit come in this place yes Lord Lord we I have a special special message because it's a special bride Lord I pray oh God that you will anoint this word Jes Lord take me off the scene oh Lord may it only be thus sayeth the Lord and may you bless the people Lord oh Father we take every Spirit under our control of the Holy Spirit and we pray that you will bless your word and speak to your little bride we ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus with many Thanksgiving amen and amen can we say amen amen you may be seated you may be seated Amen on a good day enjoy yourself right on a bad day examine yourself amen so quickly I want to talk quickly if I can excuse me if I'm going to get excited you got to excuse me if I'm going to get excited and I want to talk I quickly want to talk about good and bad days all right good and bad days and that's how I know I have to preach this because I was sitting between two sermons and the one I wanted to preach every time I go into it I I couldn't feel the Lord I couldn't feel his heartbeat I couldn't feel the presence of the Lord and I could feel how God is pushing me to this side I just wanted to mention this by greeting the church and the Lord said know this is the message this is what I want my people to hear is good and bad days I don't know about you but I'm sick and sick and tired of bad days I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired of bad days I want some good days I know we live in bad times amen bra says I read a quote last night amen he said we are living in the in the worst of of of of sinning of sinning times he said the greatest sin will be in the end time he said but at that same time it will be the greatest time for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen it will be the best of time for the Bride of Jesus Christ now good and bad days I've experienced so much bad days in my life that I don't even know how a good day look like I experienced so much bad days in my life that I thought it ought to be like that I accepted it that way I thought it had to be that way come on brother I thought when you serve God your life should be like this on come on now I thought to be a Christian is just to suffer and to carry a cross and to go through tribulations and bad times and experience bad things prach now I thought you only have to suffer your way to heaven yeah yeah oh but the devil is a liar why did David said this is the day that the Lord has made I will rejoice and be glad in it amen I've experienced so much bad days I didn't know how to act when I had a good day and God now and then would come because the Bible says he arranges the good and the bad days yeah so after a serious of bad days Our God normally comes and he arrang a good day right but when that good day came once a year or once in two years I didn't know how to act sir right I thought must I laugh or must I still cry like when somebody would give me a gift I would cry and what's wrong I'm just giving you something good I'm thinking you I'm so used to being treated bad I'm so used to experiencing bad moments I thought everybody is going to mock us and everybody's going to hate us and I'm I'm so hated by everybody and everybody's fighting you wherever you go family members at your job wherever you go in the street in the taxi in the community wherever you go even in church you think it should be like that and you come to a place where you accept it except no I must I must suffer it's part of life it's part of Christianity but let me tell you uh you're not going to fly away with a jet to heaven to go to heaven you need a cross you're not going to heaven with a Ferrari or with a por or a nice car Amen to go to heaven you need to pick up your cross and follow him and many times people don't want to pick up their cross because they see how Christians suffer come on that's right and I had to read the scripture over and over again he never said pick up your cross and follow me come on you can never pick up your cross and follow him on how many people pick up the cross they want to serve the Lord and the next day they backslide because that cross is heavy the Bible says deny yourself and pick up your cross and follow me a denied you will be able to pick up your cross and follow him but you cannot pick up your cross and just follow him now this sermon is going under the inspiration where brother preach all the days of our life come on a sermon on all the days of our life he said you better make up your mind and understand to serve God is not for a few minutes when you make a decision it's all the days of your life you should serve him it's not just till the Revival begins and when the Revival ends it's the end of you he said you better prepare yourself when God calls you it's going to be for the rest of your life that you will have to serve him you cannot serve him people try to serve him that's right you need the Holy Ghost to serve him that's right and you will never be able to pick up that cross you need to deny yourself you see you need to deny yourself every day the song says I'll choose you again and again and again Lord amen every time the devil will come around come on and and you will not able you will not be able to pick up your cross you need to deny yourself every day you need to turn against yourself your biggest enemy is yourself you need to kill yourself and brother B says you need to lay still and let God slay you and kill you and that's why you can misunderstand your trials you can misunderstand your pain you can misunderstand your sufferings brother say sometimes you can think it's a devil then it's God doing it and sometimes you think it's God then it's the devil doing it but you need to discern you see God needs to kill you now God needs to mold and and and and and break you and mold you and and put some character in you listen I always tell our church don't let your trial rob you R your trial don't come out of your trial poor listen Jesus went to hell he exper experienced yell but he came out of yell he didn't he didn't just come out of yell he came out with a key so while you experience yell in your life just find the key there's a revelation in your pain there's a revelation in your sufferings and once you find the key you will come out come out with a key come out of your trial with the Revelation come out with character come out with inspiration come out with Victory Rob your trial amen you says what this is what adoption is adoption is we are predestinated I always looked at the other churches I don't want to call names other churches and Pentecostal churches denominations and they just prosper and prosper but we as a bride why do we have to suffer like this Lord and then the Lord had to tell me we're not in the book of Corinthians we in the book of Ephesians he said say we are predestinated unto adoption and BR says in adoption book do you know what is adoption adoption is BR says the angel will come down God will send the angel and he will turn your family against you listen go to your job and turn all the colleagues against you go even into the church and turn the whole church against you just to see what you will do and then the prophet said the angel will go back to God and give a report he said I did this I turned his family against him but he still stood for you I turned his friends against him but he still stood for you I turned his colleagues against him but he still stood for you I even turned the church against him but he still stood for you and brother Brenham says and then God will tell his Angel let's go down and do something special for [Applause] him brother B says you know what is adoption adoption is problem upon problem upon problem trial upon trial upon trial we are predestinated unto adoption adoption means maturity you cannot murmur and cry all the time the brother did this somebody did this somebody did that I always tell my church when you say the brother did this the brother did that listen you can't serve God you need to die uhhuh and when you kick somebody that's dead he will not he cannot feel it that's right so why do you still feel emotional and hurt and you are not dead enough amen you need to die to serve him and God knows how to kill you brother say God knows how to work on your nerve on your weaknesses you know God let me tell you something listen we always say the devil the devil the devil the devil has no power amen God God created the the enemy knew he knew he was creating the devil and he empowered him he empowered the enemy that's why sometimes when you're in a battle you feel this person overpowers you because the devil God gives the devil or your enemies he gives them power that's right ooo brother amen but I want to tell you whatever the devil is planning it's God's plan whatever your enemies is planning now they are planning the plan of God Amen because whatever they plan God created them to plan that that's right the plan that happened with Joseph God God was there when they planned it God allowed them to plan Ito don't don't put the dream out of the house Jacob's house never ever dreamed after that never put the dream out of the house wherever the dreamer goes the dreams will go and they put him in the Putt and from the put he went to the prison and from the prison he went to the Palace but I want you to see this oh my God I want you to see this come on what happened so his brothers did that against him and then his colleagues did that against him and he went to prison but Joseph was on a journey that's called the Journey of forgiveness you see what actually put him on the throne was he had to forgive his brothers and his colleagues there's power in forgiveness listen forgiveness can open heaven for you I hope you see it forgiveness it doesn't even come from a man a normal man cannot forgive in the Garden of Eden they had everything but they were looking for forgiveness there was no forgiveness on the earth God had to come down from heaven you know to forgive it's a Heavenly nature God to come down from heaven and it took an animal slew he had to kill the animal to bring forgiveness so to forgive an animal inside of you need to [Music] die an animal inside of you need to die and there's power in forgiveness forgiveness put took uh Joseph it took Joseph out of prison and it put him on the throne he had to forgive each and everyone listen forgiveness open heaven to you when when when Steven said Lord I forgive them he said I saw the heavens open and I saw our lord Jesus forgiveness is powerful it open Heaven forgiveness is so powerful when Jesus said Lord I forgive them on the cross there came an earthquake and the de rised up forgiveness is so powerful I want you to see this relationships that's messed up forgiveness can resurrect dead relationships say I don't love this wife anymore I don't love this man anymore I'm telling you forgiveness is a powerful tool it can resurrect dead things in your life amen there's resurrection power in forgiveness oh my sorry I I just I just got drifted away I just got drifted away I just got drifted away amen and I always said Lord must we only need just suffer must we only just suffer why does the other churches being blessed he said they not predestinated unto adoption adoption is pain upon pain suffering on suffering you need to master your trials you need to get a master agree in all your problems you need to grow up and mature in your problems in your trials oh I hope you see it that's why I preached one time on a series on the School of Life the school of life you see you you find people today they've never failed any exams since preschool up to University every exam they can they pass every exam they they pass the the the primary school exam the High School exam the uh uh uh colleague colleagues wherever they go they they pass all their test and they get doctor's degree and they get Professor degrees but they fail every day in the School of Life they fail to be a good husband they fail to be a good father we don't need Doctor degrees anymore we need Doctor degrees in the School of Life man that knows how to be a husband he knows how to be a father he knows how to be a grandfather he knows how to be a Christian that's right this world need te people that have a doctor degree a professor a master degree in the school of life where you can manage your problems your problems don't push you around you push your problems around that's right amen I hope you see it yes sir I I've always looked at Christianity and I said Lord it's just the cross Carry the Cross the cross the cross the cross and the cross it's always a cross and I had a bad understanding of the Cross yeah I thought it's just suffering and pain until the Lord sold me the cross is not just a cross the cross is also a door on the Feast of Passover where did they put the blood on the doorpost Jesus hang says Between Heaven and Earth Heaven didn't want him Earth didn't want him he hang Between Heaven and Earth why because he became the door so whatever cross you experience in your life in what whatever area in your life if you have a cross experience at and uh in your family it means that's also that same cross is a breakthrough also if you suffer in a at a certain company if you suffer financially it means there's a financial door that's also going to open amen because what good is a cross without the resurrection you see when they hang Jes Jesus they wrote something on his cross your cross have a name right and you should know why are you suffering why are you being crucified because they crucified him as the king of the Jews and go guess what he resurrected as the king of the Jews whatever is written on your cross that's the area God wants to resurrect you and glorify you in I hope you see it so you can misunderstand bad days and think why do I experience only bad days Lord but I want to go deep into this because I can feel we need to get an understanding of this so that we can become adopted Sons where God can trust us matured sons of God now watch here watch I want you to see this amen and I could never understand I didn't know how to act on a good day yeah and I'm telling you this message is for somebody in here if I'm only going to help one person or two person it's going to be be worth it maybe I'm going to help somebody on that's that's live streaming but I'm telling you amen amen praise the name of the Lord you got to understand your good and bad days but watch here oo Lord in Matthew 11:28 all you who are weary and burden come to me I will give you rest and that this is my experience I didn't understand Pastor sh in the world everything was went well for me but the minute I gave my heart to the Lord all yell broke loose and I couldn't understand because in the world everything just went well for me that's why many Christians backslide but the Bible says amen broad is the way and there's a many people on it and it looks nice and easy right but at the end it's death amen oh I hope you see it you see it Hallelujah and I really thought to serve God it's only you only experience bad times you only have sufferings and all of that amen I always I always had the wrong conception of the Cross until God show me the resurrection power Jesus said he endureed the cross when he saw the glory woo he could endure the cross because he saw beyond the cross he saw the resurrection he saw that he was going to be glorified and if you don't see that the devil will only put the cross there but if you see the resurrection behind your cross you will endure your cross when God showed me that every cross is a door I'm telling you I got enthusiastic to carry my cross I got excited I wanted more crosses I didn't know every cross is a breakthrough every cross is a resurrection Hallelujah so I hope you see it also also differently but watch here I could never understand why is life like this I'm only experiencing bad days and bad things happen but in the world everything was there was no problem there and that's why people backslide to go to the world Amen because it's a easy life watch here it looks like an easy life but the devil is a [Music] liar and God that to deal with me about good and bad days you see we need the revelation of good and bad days you need a clear understanding about good and bad days and I believe that New Hope Revival family this is for you tonight I want you to understand it I was fighting with God when I was in the world it was everything went well Lord but since I served you all of H broke loose but watch watch you you think you know everything and I am telling you I God gave me a good hiding he gave me a nice hiding amen and I want you to see this amen because God told me listen my son uh you can't just wrestle with demons everything that happened in your life oh the devil the devil the devil the devil all the blood against the devil and the Lord said listen change your wrestling mats I said what do you mean Lord change your wrestling mats everything is not the devil you can't all the time run to the run and go down on your knees oh you devil you liar you this you this come on now you see um the Bible says we are wrestling our wrestling is not against flesh and blood but demons and principalities and these spirits but listen to this now Jacob also had the wrestling match come on but Jacob didn't wrestle demons no he wrestled with the angel of the Lord and I'm telling you I had the wrestling match with the angel of the Lord I wrestled about those good and bad days because I couldn't understand I'm serving you Lord yeah I don't miss Services every time when it's prayer meeting I'm there I'm living the life come on now I'm giving my everything come on maybe there's somebody that feels that way I'm giving my best to God I pay my ties my offerings I do everything that that you're asking me Lord why is life treating me this cruel yeah why do I only experience the bad look what happened to my family my children look what is happening All Around Me Lord look what happens to my car it's the one thing upon the other thing and I wrestled with the angel until the Lord answered me and I'm going to give you this I know he's going to bless you so watch here amen and I wrestled with the angel and God finally came and he spoke to me about good and bad days I was shocked when God told me I never ever created a bad day Hallelujah do you know go study go read your Bible God never ever created the bad day never did I didn't understand now why why why do I experience bad days and God so go go search the scriptures The only days I created was good days that's right God never ever up till today God only create good days and I had to go to Genesis 1 and in the beginning the spirit of God moved and he spoke let it be light and it was so and it was the first day and God said it was good second day it was good third day it was good fourth day day it was good the fth day it was [Applause] good so God never ever created a bad day so we're in trouble now we can we cannot blame God now because God only create good days and the Bible says it went on and on and the sixth day he created and he said it was very good and then the Bible goes on in the seventh day God rested so in other words God don't rest until everything is very good the reason you still experience bad days and chaotic days and dark days is because your God is still moving he's still working and he's not going to stop he's not going to rest until everything goes very good in your life the Bible said the sixth day and he said it was very good and then the seventh day he rested so want you to see this so God never ever created a bad day he only created good days Jeremiah 29:11 says for I know the plans I have for you says the Lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans of Hope and future my God is a good God my God wants you to have a good [Applause] day God wants you to enjoy your day God's original plan was always good days God created good days good things for you to experience the goodness of the Lord you must only experience the goodness of the Lord God is is not the creator of bad days he's not the creator of dark days chaotic days God only create good days and I want you to see it because God is a good god he's a caring God don't you ever come to a place to blame God don't you ever put anything on God he's a great God he's a good God brother bam says he will never fail you you will fail him but he will never fail you now watch here he's a good God and he wanted you to enjoy life Hallelujah I always tell the young people this when I speak to our young people God wanted you to enjoy life so much there was only he created everything and everything was good and well there was only one Thou shalt not so God wanted you to eny eny your life yeah only one thou shal not so God really created everything for you to enjoy yeah but when sin came in it moved from one thou sh not to 10 thou sh Nots and the more sin increased it went from 10 thou sh not to hundreds of thou shall not one time I preach about thou shall not the thou shall not Church young people don't want to hear thou sh not this thou sh not this thou sh not this thou shall not come young people thou shall not what can you do you can't even go out the way they preach thou sh not yeah come on but then David came along and said thou shall Worship the Lord thou shall enjoy your life thou shall on God wants you to enjoy life make it excited my Christianity excited you know you know up till today I cannot I cannot beat brother Bron brother says if I had a thousand lives I would give it all to him says even I even if God sends me to hell I will still love him I'm going to be honest I'm not there yet I'm not one of those I'm an honest preacher I'm not there yet you mean to tell me some people say you know I'll serve God but if if if I had another life you know I would have I would have been this or I wouldn't be a doctor I would have drove a car there and be part of this and part of that but here brother Brenham says if I had A Thousand Lives I would give it all to him and it will be worth it he says but you only have this one life and you better give it all to him all the days of your life you better give it all to him now watch here he wants you to enjoy life he wants you to enjoy life and you should enjoy life but because sin increased they became more th NS right but don't look to the th Nots look to the thou sh yeah serve the Lord with your whole heart thou shall enjoy him for me and my house we will serve the Lord now watch you watch Hallelujah I'm just I'm going to go a little bit deeper I'm going to go a little bit deeper and I want you to I want you to flow with me I want you to flow with me and I want you to see this as well amen so God created only good days God never created sick days Dark Days stressful days painful days God never never intended for you to have so much pain his original plan was a good plan in God's plan there's rest there's the goodness of the Lord there's provision everything you need is in the original plan and brother preacher sermon it was not so from the beginning that's why this message is taking us back to the beginning right I always wondered why is the devil fighting the message the way he it because this is the only message that can take you back to the original [Applause] plan Hallelujah not just Pentecost but all the way back to the Garden of Eden God never created amen days that you should experience tribulation and stress and full of problems and all of that listen God will work and work and work and work amen and work until you experience good days now watch here so and it came in the sixth day and he said it was very good good and on the seventh day God rested now listen to me quickly amen God wants to experience good days now if you have God created lights I always tell the church because the PE we we were foolish in when we came to the message they didn't taught us the right way if you want six children first build a six room house because God first created light water food fish he he created everything and lastly he created his son that's wisdom that's wisdom so when Adam was there there was already food kimes everything you need is already there everything was already there amen God's plan always work I tell the young sisters don't sometimes sometimes you allow a young man to become a father and he never desired to be a father R says God desired to be a father Yes in the beginning he had desire to be a father and he start working to become a father he started providing already created light created fishes created food he desired to be a father don't let a man make you pregnant and that man never desired to be a father find a man with a plan on father I preach this I said the God gives the plan always to the father come so if the father walks out the plan for your life walks out come on Brother come on now don't let any man be the be the father of your children on you better test him I like what says he says study nature they said the eagle don't allow any Eagle to just be her husband or the father of her kids they will fly they call it a love a love flight they will go high in the sky and then that the eagle will fall down to see if that that that that male Eagle if he will be able to look after the children if the children Falls from wherever if he can be able quick enough and lay down his life to catch that children don't allow any man to be your father of your kids need a man that have a plan a man that desires to be a father start working on it don't wait to become a father start working on your [Music] [Applause] fatherhood now watch this now as God created he said it was good when he made the fish it was good when he made food it was good when he made the fruits it was good everything he made he made and the vegetables and everything he said it was good now when you have listen to me now but when he made his first man of God he said it was very good so let me tell you now if you have lights in your house water food everything well that's good yeah but on but when God sends a man of God in your life it goes from good to very good because that man comes with thus say the Lord he comes with a word from God he comes to speak listen here I want you to see this after after God created the first man of God God created nothing further God rested I want you to see this now after God created his first man of God God did nothing further why because whatever you need that man will speak whatever you need that man will speak and when God found a man that can become the image of God God could rest in the days of no what there was trouble and air all of that you know what God was looking at God was looking for a man brother B says God have God always have a witness God will always have a man when you look at your problem God looks at a man the the Bible says in Job 14 man born in his days are full of trouble some most of you are born with trouble that's why when you get born in the hospital they cannot release the baby they first do a checkup because you're born with trouble I want you to see that but there's certain men on the earth that's born with all the answers of your trouble you need to see that he said Jeremiah I created you in your mother's womb I formed you yep to be a prophet oh my God I Sanctified you in his mother's womb yes sir and at the right time God said open your mouth I'm going to put my word in your mouth that's right so your mouth is full of trouble all this and all this but there's men of God that have your answer so you are born with a lot of troubles but there's men that's born with your answers and you need God will always cross your path with those people to to have thus say the Lord for you there's a solution B says when you take your problem and you put it in the word you don't have a problem anymore right I hope you can see it but I need to be quick I need to be quick amen I need to be quick I really want to go into this and this is like a teaching I don't I don't mind if you don't jump and sou but I want you to get this but if you say now and then amen it will help the car moving it will help me to move but watch here so things must go very well in your life when a man of God steps in your life that's what should should happen why am mean because that man will have thus say the Lord and God is looking for a man that he can trust what thus say the Lord and he said I will rise up Shepherds to look after my [Music] sheep men after God's Own Heart and that's what we need and that's how I see Pastor s is a man after God's Own Heart he carries the concern of the congregation he carries it with him he carries that burden him and his wife they are carrying it and that's what you should you need a Shepherd that's concerned that's burdened about you not only to my church I only only to my church now this is not to other church I preach in my church the bed of a man of God because when that when that woman's child die she put dead child on the bed of the Prophet that's right I hope you see it because men of God people think oh it's going well with man of God let me tell you every man of God sleeps with burdens on him and he needs visitations from God but God will come to his bed in in his room and the first thing God will do is he will he will look who's lying next to you before he speaks to you is the right woman lying next to you is it your wife I always tell my wife I cannot get a sermon from God unless you lie next to me I got five kids the reason for that is because because I a man of God will only lay two places he will lay at the feet of the Lord or with his wife there the only two places a man a true man of God will lay down at the feet of the Lord and with his own wife I hope you see it amen and she put that dead baby right there on his bed so it's not easy for a man of God he sleeps and in the night hours he can feel your burden your pain don't think nobody feels your pain and burden that's why you need to find preachers that preach with a burden somebody that experien your pain sometimes you a pastor that's called from God he can preach and while he's preaching he can feel that sister's pain in this side or that side brother Brenham could feel the people's sickness on his hand yes that's why had so much compassion oo Lord had compassion for the people because he could feel the pain they were in y and if you preach without compassion nothing will happen oh he told he told Ezekiel go late 30 days on this side I can't even lay 5 minutes on this side then I have to turn and 40 days on the other side before you go and prophesy you need to feel the pain so when you preach You Preach What a Feeling sometimes when I preach sometimes when when pastors preach and and and the fivefold ministers when ministers when they preach sometimes God put your burdens on them sometimes they even go through trials in life not for themselves but just to feel how it feels when you go through a Valley come on and God normally brings I always tell people how do you know who's your pastor your pastor never comes in your life when when it's green pastors yeah when everything goes well with the man in the business God normally connects you with your pastor when you in a valley that's right and your pastor will know that Valley and he will know how to lead you through your pastor brother and sister will see you through but let's go back to this bad days and good days because I want to show you something deep here here something deep because I don't know about you I want to experience some good days I want to prophesy that over your life good days blessed days oh I'm sick and tired of bad days and I'm sick and tired of ugly and dark days I want to experience the goodness of the Lord and brother B says don't live under your god-given privileges if healing is my inheritance I want it if Revival is my inheritance I want them if Visions dreams and Visions is my inheritance I want whatever God have available amen hallelujah it's us oh listen and I want you to see this amen I want you to see this the devil never worried about anything or he didn't even move when God created the first day the devil didn't even move when God created the second day the devil didn't even move when God created the third day he was just sitting and watching but when God created the sixth day W the devil came closer he says what is this because remember the sixth day rule all the days yeah come on the sixth day rule the first day the second day the third day the fourth day and the fifth day he told Adam I give you dominion and to rule amen over the first second third fourth and fifth day that's why the devil didn't care and worry about when God created the lion he didn't worry about the lion when God created the the the fish he didn't worry about the fish but when God created Adam his eyes were on Adam because he heard God say to Adam these words Adam I give dominion to you over the Earth over the first day second day third day over the over the over the birds in the sky I give you dominion over the ocean I give says Adam had the master key he had the key to the ocean he had the key to Nature he had the key to the to the fishes he had the key to the birds he said Adam had the master key woo I hope you see it I hope you see it so the devil didn't worry about all the other days he cared about the sixth day that's why the devil is always after people that wants to become the image of God Amen and the only way for you to become the image of God is the message of the hour the unadulterated word of God the original plan now watch here so the devil knew if I can get the sixth day then I can rule all the days I can rule the ocean I can rule the birds I can rule everything but the devil forgot there's one day God didn't give to Adam and that was the seventh day and God said the seven days is my [Applause] day I hope you see it oh there's just one day left amen there's just one move left just once more Lord amen just once more amen praise the name of the Lord there was a man there was a story they told about this man that played chess he played chess with the devil and the devil got him in a corner and he didn't know what to do and then amen God came down the master chess player and he told the man don't worry and the man wanted to give up there some of you they want to give up and then God told the man listen there's one more move and the devil don't know about it there's one more move let me tell you amen he can deceive you with the written word right but brother Brenham told us there's an Unwritten part yeah on amen he doesn't know what is that right so he cannot deceive you with the unwritten part but he can receive you with the written part of the word right there's just one move let me tell you it took all the days maybe the devil ruled your whole life I'm telling you there's one day the devil cannot take amen and that was the seventh day and God is the seventh day and that's the day of rest that's the day of Shalom that's the day of peace am now watch you quickly can I go on Pastor sh let me go on let me go on I don't like a boring preacher I don't want to sound boring I want to I want you to I want to I want to get you to a point amen I want to get you to a point so I believe I also believe that Adam fell on the sixth day that's only my belief I'm not saying th say the Lord God created Adam on the sixth day and Adam fell on the sixth day Adam backslid it on the sixth day it's amazing how many people will backslide on a Friday and tonight is Friday the sixth day it's amazing because some people in our country there some people get paid weekly on a Friday some people on a fortn night it's on a Friday and that's the day they will go and backslide and go drink they don't backslide on a Monday Tuesday they will go backslide on the sixth day because Adam fell on the sixth day they don't even know there's the original fall happen on the sixth day yeah woo Lord now watch here why do you believe it Adam fell on a Friday because the last Adam died on a Friday brother Brenham said he said God that to meet the devil on all the grounds that Adam fell on Adam fell naked and Jesus had to hang naked Adam and that's why I believe Adam fell on a Friday and Jesus had to pay the price on a Friday y woo Lord I hope you see it I hope you see it I hope you see it and that's why the sixth day became a fallen day and that's why we find the triple six The Mark of the Beast number six became a fallen number brother B says yes number six became a fallen number because the Beast and Man became one that's why the triple six is a number of a beast but it's also a number of a man right right because that's what happened in the Garden of Eden woo I want you to see this I want you to see this so I believe the the lost son left his father's house on this on a Friday Adam fell on a Friday but Jesus also died on a Friday and I want you to see that amen hallelujah but the lost son amen when he said I will rise and go to my father's house that was on a Sunday because Sunday is resurrection morning and he said I will rise and go back to my father's house Oho I hope you see it I hope you see it there's a day of return Hallelujah and we are calling right now the seed of Abram to come back to the house of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah now watch here okay okay brother can you show us this now watch here God made his image on the sixth day and here the mark of the beast and the devil also make an image in the Book of Revelation unto the Beast because he's a copycat and he does it under the number 666 to show you God under six Day created His Image but here the devil also under triple six create His Image so the Bible opened with the image of God and the Bible closes with the image of the devil I want you to see that amen now watch here carefully amen but listen now God never created a bad day but where does bad days come from Genesis 1 he introduced him as a Creator only good days where did bad days start because Genesis is a book of the beginning so everything begin in the Book of Genesis so good days started in the Book of Genesis but bad days also started in the Book of Genesis and you can read in Genesis 2 God told Adam the day you eat of that tree that's the day you die that's good so right there amen bad day started when God said in Genesis 2 he gave the horning Genesis 3 men AE of that tree and that's the day and that's the beginning of bad days yeah so in other words sin yes sir sin created bad dayso brother don't be part of sin because sin will give you chaotic days don't be part of sin watch here I want you to see this so God created only good days but God Amen God Amen Hallelujah said Adam the day you eat of De read that's the day you will die so we see Genesis 1 good day original plan Genesis 2 God give the horning Genesis 3 bad day started it became a bad Friday so bad day started on a Friday that's why Jesus died on a Friday and it's called Good Friday so every bad day was reversed to a good day when he hanged on Calvary I hope you can see that and God restored all the years that was taken away but when bad days come and God can only create good days but when bad days come it means you made wrong decisions you see brother B said you still stand before that threee to doal today you can make fun of Adam and and Eve and say how did you why did you do that he said but even every day that two trees is standing in front of us every day and you need to make a decision brother Brenham called the book of Ruth the book of redemption the book of decisons and I want you to show you this here right now in the in Ruth when you read Ruth it only have four chapters there's not a lot of chapters you know why because Ruth made the right decisions right wrong decisions in your life will give you unnecessary [Applause] chapters and we don't want unnecessary chapters in our life we want good chapters we don't want a lot of chapters in our life Ruth only had four chapters in her life Ruth chapter one she made the right decision says you make up your mind you make a decision you serve under your decision and God will reward you don't give up now amen you made a decision to serve the Lord you got to stand under your decision you got to serve under your decision and then he said the third part is God will reward you so don't give up now that's excellent because God is getting ready to reward New Hope Revival Ministry don't give up now so rotth chapter 1 she made the right decision right right come on I want you to see Naomi couldn't change her mind when Naomi saw she made up her mind she stopped why can the devil still speak to you because you didn't make up your mind but when you make up your mind and you say here I stand your God is my God your family is my family where you go I go wherever the Lord leads there I will go and Naomi stopped nagging on her to go back to her old life why can why can the old life still speak to you why can sin still speak to you because the devil knows you never made up your mind completely but you need to tune down the devil and put him on mute and let the voice of God speak to you now watch here so Ruth made the right decision in Ruth chapter 1 and then she went to chapter two what is rotth chapter 2 the right decision will take you to the right places and you will meet the right people she made the right decision in Ruth chapter one Luke Chapter 2 she met the right people and she her the seasons took her to the right place and what is rotth chapter 3 because he was at the right place yes amongst the right people in rotth chapter 3 they gave her the right advice I hope you see it root chapter 1 the right decision root chapter 2 the right people the right place root chapter 3 the right place and the right people will give you the right advice Luke chapter 4 she married the right [Applause] man we cancel every unnecessary chapter in your life God wants to do a S quick work God wants to quickly bless you he wants to quickly restore you he wants to quickly do something for you but you need to make the right decisions so the right decisions the results of your decision will manifest in your days now I'm going to go deep now if it's okay pastor sh I want because I want I never ever want you to to to go through a bad day without recognizing I want you to understand when you go through a bad day not to be a baby but to be an adopted son and daughter of God now watch here woo Lord help me so can we go deeper so God don't create bad days you got that now listen the devil cannot create a day you got to understand that the devil cannot give you a day so why do you want to serve him not aat why do you want to serve him the devil cannot give you a day he's not the creator of days God is the creator of days God is The Giver of days and I can tell you according to the word of God thus say the Lord God only give good days God have great plans to prosper you so God only created good days watch you God is creat of days this is the day that the Lord has made all right David realized now David went through many tough days bad days valleys of the shadow of death days tell it tell it deadly days dark days and yet David said this is the day that the Lord has made and when you have a revelation of your day even it's good or bad you will still Rejoice you must be so excited the devil must be confused there some people sitting here you don't even have food or money or whatever but yet you are serving God you clapping hands conf confuse the devil don't let your trials confuse you confuse the devil don't get upset upset the devil you see when the devil is out of plans he doesn't know what to do with you anymore like with job he didn't know what to do and God stepped in God said you did everything you know when the devil when the Devil comes back to his first attack then he out of plans right he don't know what to do with you anymore a that was good w HJ and let me tell you if you have enough enough love in You Hell cannot keep love love y'all will split out love don't go with a bad hard through your trials go with the right motive still honor God still praise God brother bham says every inch of the way I had to fight now watch it watch here watch it watch watch amen this is the day that the Lord has me if you have a revelation of your day you will be you will have joy and you will rejoice so God created days God is a giver of days but the devil cannot give you a day you cannot create a day but this is what yes is a problem so God create a good day tomorrow he's going to give you a good day the devil cannot give you a day tomorrow we're going to have a exciting day yeah because he's a creator of good days but what the devil does he cannot give you a day he cannot create a day for you but he can come in your god-given day he can step into your god-given day and mess up your day and make it a chaotic day and make it a bad day he can stand don't allow him ever to ever again put his foot in the day that God created for you because every day God created it's for you it's for you to rejoice and to serve the [Applause] Lord we don't have time to waste we must serve God yes sir so God will give you another day he says my mercies on you every morning every morning I meet my wife stand up and say Lord oh I receive the mercies for this day new mercies yes sir but why do you still feel the same come on now where's the new mercies you got to receive it you got receive the joy of the Lord is my strength you got to rejoice in the day of the Lord because this is your day this is the bride's time you are the Overcomer in this age now let's go quickly let's go quickly so the devil can stop in he can step into your god-given day and mess it up and give you a stressful day he can give you a bad day he can give you a terrible day he can give you a bad day now watch here but you need to get the revelation of your days now number one yeah I only begin now you have to understand where days come [Applause] from so if you read Genesis 1 the spirit of God moved and the spirit spoke uhhuh on and then he said it was good and then he said it's the first day so what how did the day came it came out of the spirit of God Amen you got to understand that a day is born out of the spirit of God right so what does that tell us that every day is ruled by Spirits every day you have to deal with Spirits because days are born out of the spirit of God and that's why the the demon spirits will come because they know a day is contained by spirits come on you got to see this you got to see this and that's why brother B say I take every Spirit under my control by the spirit of the Holy Ghost you need to control your day you see there every day there Spirits coming to attack you in life it's not it's not flesh and blood you fighting it's demon Spirits so the spirit is coming every day because a day is is the result of the day depends on what Spirit you believe and what spirit surrender to that's right now I'm talking about good days how to experience good days I want you to see this I want you to see this so days your day depend on what Spirit you listen to and what Spirit you move everything that you deal every day with there's a spirit behind itoo I hope you see it yeah because out of the day came the spirit out of the Spirit came a day so Genesis 1 out of the Spirit came a day Revelation one look at the beginning Genesis 1 the spirit moved and a day came it was born in Revelation 1 John says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day you see John got a revelation that out of the Spirit came a day and for me to overcome and to survive I need to come in the spirit that's good so for you now I hope you see it so days was created by the spirit of God and that's why every day you fight Spirits Hallelujah woo and you have to see this and the prophet said you need to take control over every spirit so everything is about spirits and number two you got to understand every day you are facing Spirits I hope you see it if you don't see this you will continue to face bad days you got to understand it's not that sister it's not that colleague at work it's not that family member brother says if we can if we can kill the influence the spirit that influenc that person we can save that person if we stop the influence that's right so kill the influence which is a spirit that manager that's full of devils at work if you can take authority over the spirit that's using her that's right and just speak over her life and said you are the sweetest man manager you are the best of the best and just release the spirit of God over that person you will experience a better manager that's right that's right amen amen now watch your number two number two so number one you need to understand you're fighting Spirits every day every day it's Spirits every day and that demon Spirits can use your children your wife your husband whoever and you need to get the revelation of it number two days are created by words on the spirit move God poke yes and that's where come into the spoken word is God's original seed listen now what I say so your word your day determines what words is being used and God said in the first day let it be light there was light God said Let It Be fish there was fish right so whatever you see today the mountains the rivers its words right that's right so words create your day show me your life then I'll tell you what words you use hello amen show me your life then I know what words you use because words controls a day now let me make an example let me show you how words control your day the spirit of God spoke the first day the spirit the spirit of God moved and spoke again the spirit of God spoke again so words create days it's amazing how you go to work in the morning and you go to work when you come home you tell your your wife ask you how was your day you said I had a bad day day and your wife will ask you what happened and you said maybe the manager uh had a fight with me or or the manager argued with me or said something ugly about me and that's why I had a bad day because somebody gave you bad words come on come on because words make your dayoo I hope you see it I hope you see it that's why Eve had a bad day because she received Satan's words the serpent the Serpent's words she believed his words and she from that day she experienced pain and sufferings but Mary said Let It Be unto me according to Thy word your day is determined by words came in the prayer line and a woman came up I think it's on the video the woman came to says you're not sick I see a dark cloud it's lies in fact it's church people they called you a witch he says the stress and the panic and the nervousness is caused by what they said over your life that woman was in pain she was in sufferings she had a nervous breakdown because somebody called her a witch and brother Brenham said sister don't believe it you are healed wo brother brother and sister listen that's why it's good to be amongst people that pronounces the right words over your life don't be in a company of people that hate you don't walk with people that back mouth you and badmouth you be careful for what people say and speak over your life you need to know how brother Brenham says words don't die words don't die somebody called you a witch 20 years ago you still hear that words and you you still get depressed because that words never died right dead words come up and down and the devil takes it and through your mind and every time you get upset of these words and you get nervous breakdowns that's why you need to cancel that words in the spiritual realm that's right you need to be amen like Maran like Maran said I received the word of God in my life God told me he said you need to know how to delete some people's words and you know and when somebody has something good to say about you you need to record their words and replay it now and then that's good brother and say what ever somebody say bad about you I don't care what you say I care what God have to say about me amen can I still do five five minutes Pastor sh watch here watch here so if you understand that every day is controlled by spirits and words can you see that it's words words can kill you words words can make you sick power power words can can give you a chaotic day be in a company of people that knows how to speak good words over you right that's why the Jews I think Pastor sh preach about it to to ha the seeds of Destiny in your life get people that water the seeds of Destiny in your life that say you are a good child or you're going to be this you're going to be that you're going to be great you are going to be successful you are you are going to be blessed blessed now watch brother B um now watch I want you to see this if people don't have anything good to say about you the prophet said rather keep your mouth yeah if you have nothing good to say about your brother keep quiet because the prophet knows what words can do right you are killing somebody's husband you are killing Somebody's Daughter with your words you are messing people's marriages up with your words every time that man comes home from work depressed and who suffers the wife and the children that's why we know our role as preachers we need to say thus say the Lord don't allow the enemy to speak over your life don't allow the enemy to ever speak over your children speak the word of God over your own life oh my God oh my I'm nearly there I'm nearly there brother says words is so powerful he says even Noah's if we have the right instruments we can still pick up Noah's sermon he says we can even if we tune in we can even pick up the unwritten word whatever was discussed on the mountain of transfiguration between Jesus Moses and Elijah brother I want to tune into that yeah you can stay next to a radio station if you're not tuned in you will hear nothing right says there's something inside of you that can pick up the supernatural yes that's good I'm more interested in what Noah preached what was said on the mountain of transfiguration come on because it changed Jesus body and we are the body of Jesus Christ whatever was discussed there on the Mysteries the secrets what everyone just discussed there the mystery to our body chain lays right there because it's a closing and opening of a dispensation amen and I want you to see it I want you to see it I'm more interested in that then to worry what people have to say about us now watch here watch here you have to have revelation of your day you got to understand your day it's important to understand it so how do you receive good days here we go now Point number one start your day like God starts his day I said Lord how do you start your day he said go read Genesis 1 I started my day with Heaven first and then I made my Earth don't just jump up and go face your day but make sure that when you begin and start your day begin your day with Heaven yeah that's good and after you started your day with heaven then you can face your Earth yeah face your Earth with your Heaven the Bible says as it is in heaven so shall it be on the earth so everything the will of God is Not on even on the earth the will of God for your life is in heaven so you to live and put your ear into heaven to hear what God have to say about your life so that it can manifest on the earth for you so when you start your day with Heaven you can face your Earth whatever your Earth is hallelujah Point number two start your day with the spirit of God because days were born out of the spirit of God then you will have a good day start your day with the word of God because the word of God Is Creative it Chang atmospheres it can change your day it can it can change a bad day into a good day brother Bram said he said how many times he said that man since birth that blind man experienced bad days he said but Jesus came and changed it from that day with his words with the word of God he changed their lives so start your day with a with a spirit of God with heaven with with the word of God now watch here so God is still in control amen the musicians can come Ecclesiastes 7:4 now I'm going to deal with this God arranges the days the good and the bad so although God only created good days right bad days were also born right but God is saying listen Satan you are not in control of the good and the bad days you are you are not going to determine the good when is going to be a good day when it's going to be a bad day because I'm going to arrange it so when God sees you go through too much trials in life God will arrange a good weekend like this weekend I feel we're going to have a good weekend some of you experience hell this whole week maybe for years for months but I'm telling you this weekend you are going to experience the goodness of God because God arranges it now and then and what does the Bible say God took to the scripture on a good day enjoy yourself yeah so whenever God brings you a good day enjoy it right but he says examine your bad days so in other words go back and look through your day what mistake did I do good who did I listen to what Spirit did I allow how did the enemy get in how did the devil come in here you need to ex you need to examine your bad days you know why the Bible says examine your bad days so that you can have no more bad days you can only lesser and lesser the more you examine your bad days the lesser lesser bad days you will experience oo Lord help me Father help me Lord so I'm going to finish off here Satan is not in control Satan is not in control oh God will arrange a good day for you and you hope Revival it's time I'm ending your bad days you can speak it and say devil oh you know Revelation 12 the devil says my time is short you need to remind him when the devil take a minute of your day you say hey remember in Revelation 12 you said my time is short your time is short get out here don't give the devil a minute he will take an hour if you give him an hour he'll take a day if you give him a day he'll take your week if you if you give him a week he will take your month if you give him a month he will take your [Music] year so tell the devil I'm not giving you a minute the minute he walks in you stop him O Lord Oh Lord and remind him your time is short I don't have time for the devil oh we want time with God confuse the devil now what I'm ending off the Bible talks about the Lord's day they can play something if they can play that How Great Is Our God watch here God the day of the Lord God in Genesis only created good days and God is about to restore it he's about to take us back there Hallelujah where even brother Brenham experience a storm and he wanted to run down the mountain but it brother bam came into the day where he became a chew where God told him not to run away no more no more we're not going to run away no more we're not going to allow the devil to chase us no more we're going to chase the devil and he said brandom brother brandom Don't Run Away speak to the storm why cry speak Hallelujah to the storm you see the devil knows that words control your day he will prize you to release the wrong words Hallelujah God don't care about me God don't love me and it's a lie but he will pressurize your life and put you under so much pressure for you to pronounce the wrong words and when you pronounce the wrong wrong words bad things will happen yeah because words control your day right try to remember the scriptures I like what Pastor sh years ago said he said he went through so much trials he couldn't even find the scripture he only had a song yes but put a lot of word inside of your spirit put a lot of songs inside of your spirit and the day when it comes and you don't know what to do yes that word that's deep in your soul will come out that song deep inside of Pastor s's Soul brought him out amen amen memorize the word of God spend time with the word of God whatever the devil attack release the word of God Jesus Jesus Jesus withstand the Devil with the word of your testimony and start testifying against him Hallelujah so good we have have a I will restore message right and in Jo he said all the years that the caterpillar the Palm home all the years that was destroyed in your life right in the bride's life amen God is getting ready to restore it do you believe that God can give your years back there's a song that says I'm going to go to the enemy's camp and I'm going to take back what he stole from me he's a liar take back what he stole from you Hallelujah listen that's why Joseph all the years that he was suffering he gave he his his one of his sons named is the meaning of one of his sons name is to forget for God to help him to forget his pain and his sufferings may God release an anointing for us to forget all the years that we suffered that the devil took away from us God is about to restore those years he's about to give back and Pastor sh preached about this I I studied those things those years about restoration but then you did a study on restitution and restoration where the devil have to give double back what he took away even Sevenfold back what he took away right but we not only talking about to restore we are talking about restor God is going to give back [Music] extra in a day's time you will forget all the sufferings you will forget your sufferings it will be easy for you to forgive like Joseph when his brothers came there he said I already forgave you two years ago when I took this message my whole family turned against me and we stay in a small town so whenever me and my wife would meet them in the aisle they would walk past us in a shopping mall without greeting us because we left our grandfather's Church to come to the message it was hard for me you see some people come easy in the message that's why they can mess it up but for some people it it cost them everything I lost all my family for this message so the only thing I have is the message and I'm not going to mess it up on but two years ago I preached on Joseph Joseph's family is coming back and I want to release it over you your family is coming [Music] back and I didn't know that morning my cousin came to church one of the brothers worked with his wives and invited him and he came to church and here my cousin was in church and I preached God is's bringing your family back and you know what happened that day he he accepted the message Mage he's two years with me and when he accepted the message his sister came and when his sister came the rest of the family started coming God is going to restore he's going to give back all the years the enemy took away from you he's going to give it back you got to believe it he's going to give it back he's going to give it [Applause] [Music] [Applause] back I'm going to finish off let's stand sister if if somebody can put up
