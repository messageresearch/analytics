[0:00] this is a woman who has a destiny that's
[0:02] bigger than her profession bigger than
[0:07] her behavior and that's what Solomon
[0:09] asked God to let him see
[0:17] we read where God appears to King
[0:21] Solomon in a dream and in this dream God
[0:25] speaks directly to King Solomon and says
[0:29] to him whatever you ask of me I'm going
[0:34] to give it to you how many of you know
[0:37] that's a good dream God was in it God
[0:40] showed up God did the talking and God
[0:43] performed what he said and I would like
[0:45] to read for you the prayer that Solomon
[0:49] prayed in response to God visiting him
[0:53] in a dream he said give therefore thy
[0:56] servant an understanding heart to judge
[1:01] thy people that I may discern between
[1:05] good and bad for who is able to judge
[1:10] this thy so great of people Solomon is
[1:15] asking Lord give me a hearing heart
[1:20] a hearing mind that I might be able to
[1:24] make a judgment a discernment about that
[1:27] which is good and that word Toth is a
[1:31] word that is sometimes translated to me
[1:34] fully functional Lord give me a heart to
[1:39] discern between that which is fully
[1:42] functional and and bad
[1:47] tove is good raaah is bad
[1:51] rah it's not necessarily evil the
[1:55] sometimes it can be used with an evil
[1:56] intent but it also can be translated not
[2:01] bringing forth full potential so God
[2:08] give me a hearing mind
[2:11] Solomon's pray that I might be able to
[2:14] discern between that which is
[2:17] functioning fully as the Creator
[2:20] designed it to function he didn't want
[2:23] to just be able to have to say good evil
[2:26] he said I want to be able to cut the
[2:29] line right down between the most
[2:32] productive and and and the saddest seed
[2:35] it's not producing even a third of the
[2:39] potential all right now Solomon is
[2:41] asking the Lord I want to be able to see
[2:43] and discern and hear the difference
[2:46] between a seed that's bringing forth
[2:48] fullness and one that is not and guess
[2:50] what happens God answers his prayer he
[2:54] not only grants him that ability he does
[2:57] it quickly he's being tested now on his
[2:59] prayer and guess who is next in line for
[3:03] their appointment in the presence of the
[3:06] king two prostitutes not one righteous
[3:10] woman and one filthy woman - filthy
[3:14] women
[3:16] [Music]
[3:17] evil it's evil but I want you to know
[3:23] Solomon didn't pray Lord let me see the
[3:25] good from the evil he said let me see
[3:29] the good from the bad let me see the
[3:31] toll from the raw so here come two
[3:34] prostitutes both of them participating
[3:37] in evil things but Solomon had an answer
[3:41] to his prayer now the Jewish sages
[3:44] believe that he knew immediately who the
[3:47] mother was but he knew it was very
[3:50] important for those witnessing this
[3:54] moment to see who the mother was but
[3:58] because of the wisdom and because of the
[4:01] hearing heart to discern the difference
[4:04] between fully functional and not he said
[4:09] bring me a sword that was really all he
[4:15] had to say he said bring me a sword and
[4:19] we're going to divide the baby and the
[4:22] real mother steps forward and she does
[4:26] not say notice this she does not say I'm
[4:29] the real mother give the baby to me you
[4:35] know why that would have been wrong not
[4:40] evil bad I wasn't gonna produce anything
[4:45] see just a moment ago she'd been selling
[4:48] herself or giving herself away she
[4:50] wasn't thinking about the welfare of
[4:53] that baby when she was choosing her
[4:56] profession and her lifestyle this is not
[5:00] a noble woman but this is a woman who
[5:06] has a destiny that's bigger than her
[5:09] discipline
[5:11] this is a woman who has a destiny that's
[5:15] bigger than her profession bigger than
[5:19] her behavior and that's what Solomon
[5:21] asked God to let him see
