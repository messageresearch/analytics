[1:13] uncompromised gospel of the Lord Jesus
[1:15] Christ It's a Wonderful privilege that
[1:18] we have to be able to speak openly and
[1:21] freely about the wonderful things of God
[1:24] I want you to know that we don't need to
[1:26] take it for granted we need to thank the
[1:28] Lord for these Divine Christian
[1:31] broadcast networks that are dedicated to
[1:34] getting the whole gospel out to the
[1:37] nations of the world and so I want to
[1:39] thank the Lord today for the privilege
[1:42] that he's given us to be on such fine
[1:45] gospel networks I want us to look to the
[1:48] word of God today and begin a study I I
[1:52] don't know what I'm going to call it yet
[1:54] we'll just get into it and see what the
[1:56] Lord has but I want to invite you first
[1:58] to visit our Ministry website at
[2:02] revival. g

[2:08] request and it would be our honor and
[2:10] privilege to help you pray we believe
[2:13] that there's power in prayer and it
[2:16] would be an honor to join with you in
[2:18] faith and believe God to meet your needs
[2:21] so let's get ready now and go right to
[2:23] the word of God Amen I'm going to begin
[2:26] reading today in Exodus chapter 25 verse
[2:31] 8 and9 we're going to be speaking about
[2:35] uh God's pattern God's pattern and what
[2:39] it means to measure up to God's pattern
[2:43] we're living in an hour today where uh
[2:46] it it reminds me so much of what we read
[2:49] about in The Book of kings and in The
[2:51] Chronicles of the older Covenant where
[2:54] it talks about every man doing that
[2:57] which is right in his own eyes the only
[3:00] time that the scripture mentions people
[3:03] doing what's right in their own eyes
[3:06] it's always a time of Calamity it's
[3:08] always a time uh of great trouble and of
[3:12] great distress and in the hour that
[3:14] we're living in all over this wonderful
[3:17] world that God has made we are finding
[3:21] out that people are ignoring God's
[3:24] pattern uh so many people seem to have
[3:27] no regard for God 's desires and what it
[3:31] means to please the Lord he's our
[3:34] creator and he's been so good to us and
[3:38] it's the least that we can do like the
[3:40] Apostle Paul said that we should present
[3:43] our bodies as a Living Sacrifice holy
[3:48] and acceptable unto God which is our
[3:51] reasonable service I want us to look at
[3:55] some of the scriptures that remind us
[3:58] that God is a particular God you might
[4:02] call him a picky God someone who is very
[4:06] sure about what he desires what he wants
[4:10] how he wants things to be the older
[4:13] Covenant gives us such a beautiful
[4:15] picture of of God's detail oriented
[4:20] mindset I like to call him a meticulous
[4:23] God uh he cared about everything to the
[4:27] smallest detail in the construction of
[4:31] the Tabernacle in the construction of
[4:34] the temple and the furnishings and the
[4:36] veils and all of the of the other
[4:39] implements that were to be used in the
[4:41] Tabernacle and I think it sends us a
[4:44] message today that God cares about us he
[4:49] cares about even the meticulous details
[4:52] of Our Lives he cares what we're going
[4:56] through what we're facing in life the
[4:59] burden s we carry the pain we feel the
[5:02] grief that we endure the New Testament
[5:05] talks about the fact that not one Little
[5:08] Sparrow that's a smallest little bird
[5:11] falls to the ground uh except that the
[5:14] father knows about it he doesn't miss
[5:17] even the smallest little sparrow that
[5:19] that loses his perch and falls to the
[5:22] ground he is careful to clothe the lies
[5:27] to make sure that the lies come up in
[5:29] the right season and unfurl their beauty
[5:33] the beauty that is a reflection of our
[5:37] Creator God cares about those things uh
[5:40] he says that we should cast our cares on
[5:44] him that's not just our heavy burdens
[5:47] but it's every care every burden
[5:51] everything that that troubles us or
[5:54] concerns us God cares about that it also
[5:58] says to us us that God is concerned
[6:02] about how we live our lives he doesn't
[6:04] want us uh groping around in the
[6:07] darkness trying to find our way
[6:10] wondering guessing what it takes to
[6:13] please God and that's why he gave us
[6:15] this word as an absolute it is a
[6:19] beautiful record of the word of God and
[6:22] in the pages of this beautiful love
[6:26] story we find God's requirements we find
[6:31] a description of what it takes to please
[6:35] God and to show him how much we love him
[6:38] you know it's just not about words it's
[6:41] about action it's about it's about our
[6:43] deed it's about a life of surrender I
[6:47] don't want you to misunderstand in this
[6:50] teaching or in the teachings that we're
[6:52] going to be do going to be doing in the
[6:54] next few weeks I don't want you to
[6:56] misunderstand as though I'm trying to to
[6:59] teach you that we are saved by our
[7:02] Behavior or by our works I understand
[7:05] from the scriptural record that we are
[7:07] not saved by works we are saved by grace
[7:12] by faith in the finished work of our
[7:15] sacrificial lamb the Lord Jesus Christ
[7:19] Yeshua our Messiah but we are saved unto
[7:23] Works in other words we are not saved by
[7:27] works but when we are saved d by the
[7:30] grace of God he gives us the grace he
[7:34] gives us the power to do the works of
[7:38] righteousness to live a life that
[7:41] pleases him I remember uh reading one
[7:46] time in a in a book called Glory written
[7:50] by a missionary whose name was Ruth Ward
[7:53] hefin she talked about uh when a young
[7:57] woman is uh uh looking for a Suitor or a
[8:02] young man is looking for a young lady to
[8:04] court and she said if you get young
[8:06] ladies talking H they notice every
[8:09] detail about this handsome young man the
[8:12] way he stands the way he smells the way
[8:15] he walks because they're watching him
[8:18] very carefully you know and uh Ruth said
[8:22] in her book well then that young lady
[8:25] will start to try to discover what he
[8:28] likes uh so that she can uh capture his
[8:32] attention somehow maybe she finds out
[8:36] that he likes Limon pie so she's going
[8:39] to bake him a lemon pie in other words
[8:42] wouldn't it be awful to to spend your
[8:45] whole life baking lemon pies for God our
[8:49] Father and find out when we get to
[8:52] heaven that he couldn't stand lemon pies
[8:55] he was actually partial to Strawberry
[8:58] you could have easily made a strawberry
[9:00] pie if you would have known that that's
[9:02] what his heart really desired and so
[9:06] Ruth was saying when you're trying to uh
[9:09] capture a young man's attention you do
[9:12] it by discovering the things that he
[9:14] likes and pleasing him it's a love
[9:18] affair and I think a young man who cares
[9:20] about a young woman would go about it
[9:22] the same way he would find out what kind
[9:25] of music she liked what her favorite
[9:28] color was what kind of hobbies she had
[9:31] because if you want to capture someone's
[9:33] heart there's a way to go about it and
[9:36] that is to do the things that that
[9:38] please the things that are Pleasant the
[9:41] things that are lovely to that person
[9:43] who you are showing interest in and
[9:46] that's how it is in our love affair with
[9:49] the Lord Jesus Christ we want to find
[9:52] out we want to discover the things that
[9:54] he loves why because I want to love what
[9:58] he loves I want to understand the things
[10:01] that he hates why because I want to hate
[10:05] the things that he hates I want to
[10:08] please him in every way Beloved the Lord
[10:12] is seeking out a bride not just a church
[10:16] he's looking for an elected lady he's
[10:19] looking for a company of Overcomers who
[10:22] will lean their head on the on the chest
[10:27] of the Beloved so close close to his
[10:29] heart that we might even discover the
[10:33] heartbeat of our Messiah of our Heavenly
[10:36] lover so that we can know everything
[10:39] there is to know about what he's
[10:41] thinking and what he's Desiring for the
[10:44] coming days upon the Earth we are headed
[10:48] into very very perilous times I want you
[10:52] to understand that the world as we have
[10:55] known it a generation ago we'll never
[10:58] see that again again until greater days
[11:02] Millennial days at the end of the great
[11:04] Wrath of the Great Tribulation we're
[11:07] we're headed into very very Troublesome
[11:10] times governments are shaking the Earth
[11:14] is quaking there are signs and wonders
[11:17] the threat of nuclear war the the the
[11:20] threat of global terrorism we could go
[11:23] on and on stock markets crashing uh
[11:27] Financial uh Market markets are are
[11:29] bottoming out currency is being devalued
[11:33] listen folk the world is in trouble the
[11:37] only hope that people have is in a
[11:41] saving relationship in a trusting
[11:44] relationship with our faithful Creator
[11:46] God and I I just really believe that a
[11:50] call is going forth in this hour to rise
[11:54] above the status quo rise above average
[11:58] Church ity and truly discover what
[12:02] pleases the Lord so that we can live
[12:05] that sort of a life so that we can
[12:07] please him in all things let's take a
[12:11] look at the scriptural record and let's
[12:14] let's just establish in our minds in our
[12:18] Spirits the fact that God knows what he
[12:21] wants you know I'm just happy that we
[12:23] serve a God who is not what we might say
[12:27] wishy-washy we serve a God who is uh
[12:31] steady who is
[12:34] predictable because he gives us a record
[12:38] uh a track record we could say in his
[12:41] word we know that there's not a
[12:43] situation too big for him to uh
[12:46] undertake in there's not a sickness too
[12:49] grave for the great physician to step in
[12:53] and heal there's not a person so wicked
[12:57] so far away away from righteousness that
[13:00] his hand cannot reach down to save and
[13:04] to deliver we just serve a great big
[13:08] capable God and it's vitally important
[13:11] in this hour that we come into a place
[13:14] of intimate fellowship with him and love
[13:18] him like we've never loved him before
[13:21] and begin to discover uh what it means
[13:24] to become his wife in the end time what
[13:28] it means to be joined with messiah in
[13:33] holy Union so that the final works of
[13:38] God on planet Earth a great cooperation
[13:41] between the Heavenly bridegroom and the
[13:44] Earthly bride that that great uh uh
[13:48] consummation of the ages can come
[13:51] together and we can uh play out the
[13:55] final chapter of this drama so that we
[13:58] can move move into our Eternal place of
[14:02] safety uh in his arms I don't know about
[14:05] you but I'm looking forward to
[14:08] Eternity but I'm I'm going to be honest
[14:11] with you I'm getting a little bit
[14:12] excited about today and tomorrow because
[14:16] there's such a great opportunity in
[14:18] front of us to be able to become one
[14:22] with him and to demonstrate his
[14:25] character to demonstrate his attri rutes
[14:29] on planet earth once again like we read
[14:32] about in the acts of the Holy Spirit
[14:35] through the apostles that great chapter
[14:38] great book of the Bible after the four
[14:41] gospels uh most people call it Acts of
[14:44] the Apostles but we know that it's not
[14:46] what the apostles did but it's about
[14:49] what the Holy Spirit did through the
[14:52] apostles how many of you listening or
[14:54] watching this broadcast right now desire
[14:57] to be one of of those yielded vessels
[15:01] one of those uh Endtime Apostles that
[15:05] God could flow through you and
[15:07] demonstrate his power through you like
[15:09] he did through Peter and through Paul
[15:12] and through James and through John of
[15:14] old remember that the scripture tells us
[15:18] Jesus Christ Hebrews 13 and8 Jesus
[15:22] Christ the same yesterday and today and
[15:26] forever he changes not Exodus 25 verse 8
[15:31] and9 says and let them make me a
[15:35] sanctuary God was looking for a
[15:39] sanctuary to dwell in he was already
[15:42] dwelling in the sanctuary of the
[15:44] heavenlies but he desired to come down
[15:48] and dwell in a sanctuary so that he
[15:52] might relate to mankind that I may dwell
[15:56] among them the second part of verse 8
[16:00] tells us and then in verse n according
[16:03] to all that I will show thee this must
[16:07] have been a relief for Moses that he
[16:10] wouldn't have to figure it out on his
[16:12] own that he wouldn't have to try to
[16:15] guess and hit and miss to figure out
[16:17] what it was that God wanted in this
[16:21] Sanctuary that he wanted to come and
[16:23] dwell in God said to Moses I'm going to
[16:26] show you the pattern
[16:29] he goes on to say according to all that
[16:31] I show thee after the pattern of the
[16:35] Tabernacle in Hebrew the word Tabernacle
[16:38] is mishon and the pattern of all the
[16:42] instruments thereof even so shall ye
[16:47] make it and so Not only was the
[16:50] tabernacle pattern the pattern for the
[16:53] actual Sanctuary going to be given but
[16:56] every piece of furniture every
[16:59] instrument that was going to be used in
[17:02] the mishon in the sanctuary was also
[17:05] going to be revealed to Moses by pattern
[17:09] so that it could be created in the earth
[17:13] exactly like it was shown to Moses in
[17:16] the heavenlies I think if we're going to
[17:19] discover God's pattern for mankind we're
[17:22] going to have to get in the spirit to do
[17:24] it we're going to have to like Moses to
[17:27] be caught up in the realm of the spirit
[17:30] when we stay in the realm of the Flesh
[17:32] in the realm of the Soul it's so
[17:35] depressing we're we're we're reading all
[17:37] the bad news and our spirit is getting
[17:40] drugged down we need to soar like an
[17:43] eagle we need to draw close to the Lord
[17:45] in prayer and In Praise so that we can
[17:48] find ourselves as John did in Revelation
[17:51] chap one I was in the spirit on the
[17:55] Lord's Day John said you and I need to
[17:58] pray or praise until we can get in the
[18:02] spirit because it's only in the spirit
[18:05] that we begin to discover the pattern
[18:09] that God has determined and purposed for
[18:12] our lives for our Destinies here on
[18:16] planet Earth now let's just talk about
[18:18] for just a moment why God had this need
[18:22] why he needed or desired to to have a
[18:26] tabernacle uh up until this point the
[18:29] heavens were his Sanctuary even the
[18:32] Earth was his Tabernacle but now he
[18:35] wanted to come down and to sort of
[18:38] confine himself in in one uh aspect we
[18:42] could say he wanted to come down and
[18:44] dwell in a in a Tabernacle in a in a
[18:49] tent uh I'd like to say for a
[18:52] concentrated purpose for a for a
[18:56] manifested purpose now now when we're
[18:58] talking about the spirit of the lord we
[19:02] understand that God is omnipresent his
[19:04] spirit is everywhere at the same time
[19:07] that's how we can have a good Holy Ghost
[19:09] service in Smith Station Alabama and you
[19:12] can have a good Holy Ghost service in
[19:14] India or in Norway or in England or
[19:18] Iceland or wherever you might be
[19:21] watching this broadcast because the
[19:23] spirit of God is omnipresent it means he
[19:26] can be everywhere at one time time
[19:29] however there is a manifested presence
[19:32] of God that we read about in the older
[19:35] Covenant where God comes down in a
[19:39] manifest way and appeared for instance
[19:42] when he appeared to Moses on the
[19:45] mountain and he came down and pronounced
[19:48] his name before Moses when Moses was
[19:52] given the second uh set of tablets and
[19:55] was called up in the mountain to meet
[19:57] the Lord so there is a concentration of
[20:01] his presence in this tent of meeting
[20:04] this Tabernacle this Sanctuary so let's
[20:07] look at the four reasons why why we uh
[20:11] find out why we discover that God wanted
[20:14] to to find himself or to to bring
[20:16] himself into a tabernacle number one so
[20:19] that God might dwell among his people
[20:22] this was the desire of God he didn't
[20:24] want to just be an abstract Spirit
[20:26] floating over every one's head like a
[20:29] balloon or a cloud he wanted to come
[20:32] down and dwell with men why because even
[20:36] the great Creator the Living God of
[20:39] Eternity he desires Fellowship this this
[20:43] I don't know if this is a good
[20:45] expression or not but it it short
[20:47] circuits my brain sometime when I when I
[20:49] think about the fact that the god of
[20:52] Eternity so loves me so loves you that
[20:58] he desires to come down and dwell not
[21:02] only with us but in this period of the
[21:05] newer Covenant he wants to dwell in Us
[21:09] by the power of the Holy Spirit of the
[21:12] Holy Ghost and so this was uh similar to
[21:16] what God desired in the Garden of Eden
[21:19] when he came down and had fellowship
[21:22] with Adam and Eve but now he has two
[21:25] million people that he wants to have
[21:27] Fellowship with and so he decides to
[21:30] come down and with his with his manifest
[21:34] presence his Shak presence into a tent a
[21:39] tent of meeting a tabernacle so that he
[21:41] might dwell among his people number two
[21:44] he wanted to teach his people about his
[21:50] Holiness now I tell you this is a huge
[21:53] lesson that we want to learn that we
[21:56] need to learn and and much of the
[21:59] Holiness of God is revealed in the
[22:01] scripture he is so holy God Is So holy
[22:08] that our human Minds can hardly
[22:13] grasp uh understand or even begin to
[22:17] scratch the surface of what it means to
[22:21] serve a holy God and he wanted to reveal
[22:27] his Holly
[22:28] to his people he wanted his people to
[22:31] begin to understand his Holiness so that
[22:35] we could approach him not in fear but in
[22:39] reverence in respect and by the way all
[22:44] fear is not wrong Isaiah 111 and2 talks
[22:49] about the seven spirits of God and one
[22:52] of those Spirits is the spirit of of of
[22:55] fear it's reverential fear fear God
[22:59] wants us walking in a reverential fear a
[23:03] fear uh that is not a fear of if we make
[23:07] the wrong step he's going to
[23:09] disintegrate us rather it's a fear that
[23:13] brings concern to our Inner Man lest we
[23:17] do anything that would displease him
[23:21] because we love him so much we want to
[23:24] honor him and we want to please him you
[23:27] may be listening to this broadcast right
[23:29] now and you may think you love the Lord
[23:31] more than anything else in all the world
[23:34] but I want to tell you the bride of
[23:36] Christ is going to be called in this
[23:38] hour to a place of love into a
[23:42] relationship a love affair with the Lord
[23:45] that's going to determine every step
[23:48] that we make it's going to begin to
[23:50] dictate every choice that we make in
[23:53] life every direction that we turn in
[23:56] we're going to walk before for him in
[23:58] such love such perfect love such
[24:01] reverential fear that we won't do
[24:04] anything unless we know that it is the
[24:08] will of our father we have this example
[24:10] in our Messiah Jesus told them I don't
[24:14] do anything unless it's shown to me of
[24:17] my father what a perfect and beautiful
[24:20] example he was before us he was the
[24:24] spirit of God tabernacled in human flesh
[24:27] and yet he wouldn't do anything in this
[24:29] earth unless it was shown to him given
[24:32] to him of the father what if I told you
[24:35] that there's going to be a remnant of
[24:37] people an overcoming bride in the last
[24:41] days that will walk before the Lord in
[24:44] that same place of surrender in that
[24:47] same place of reverential fear that we
[24:50] will do nothing unless it's shown to us
[24:53] of the father are we there yet no but I
[24:56] want you to know we're closer to being
[24:59] there than we were yesterday God's
[25:02] economy is rolling on you may look
[25:05] around you and think that things are at
[25:07] a standstill but I want you to know
[25:10] beneath the surface of this old flesh
[25:12] there's an inner work that's going on
[25:15] thanks be to God there's an inner work
[25:18] that's going on and the spirit of God is
[25:21] bringing a cleansing he's bringing a
[25:23] correction he's causing even iron to
[25:27] sharpen iron there are even conflicts
[25:30] that go on sometime in our Earthly
[25:33] relationships that drive us to our knees
[25:37] sometimes it's on our knees in
[25:38] Repentance sometimes it's on our knees
