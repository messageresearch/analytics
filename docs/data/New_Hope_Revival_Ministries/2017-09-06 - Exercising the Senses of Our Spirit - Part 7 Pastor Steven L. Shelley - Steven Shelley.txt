TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the program today and tell you what a joy it is to be able to come to you wherever you are watching this program in all the many nations of the world we've been having a great time these past few weeks in a series on exercising the senses of our spirit and I pray that you have been encouraged and that you have been stirred perhaps it has created something in you that you want to move into this realm of the Spirit and we see that God is taking his people into deeper depths and higher heights in him all over the world things are moving and shaking and stirring the angelic activity is at a very high level there are miracles breaking out and we hear great reports of even creative miracles are taking place and I believe that we're seeing the beginning rumblings of something mighty that we've been believing for praying for preaching about prophesying declaring for so many years now so really it's a very excited time I want to invite you to contact our ministry new hope revival ministries here in Alabama in the United States of America you can see the contact information given to you on the screen visit our ministry website or send us a letter give us a call let us know you're watching the program if something is said that's a blessing to you take just a moment of your time and let us know it will be an encouragement to those who work so diligently to help make this program possible we're so blessed to be a part of two great networks gospel channel coming out of Iceland all across the UK and Scandinavia and Europe and then angel TV coming from indy all through Asia doing a wonderful work for the Lord both of these networks are streamed on the Internet perhaps you may be seeing this program by podcast or DVD anyway it just seems like as technology progresses greater opportunities are made available for us to share what the Lord puts in our hearts and we see that happening and expanding all over the world and I'm excited about it I believe that the teaching that we need is is becoming more readily available God is anointing his servants his teachers is his apostles and prophets and so much is happening right now and I'll just say it's not a time to be slack it's a time to put our shoulder to the plough and press onward and forward toward the prize of the high calling in the Lord Jesus Christ so I encourage you to do that let's look right to the Word of God begin our study today I want to read again in Genesis chapter 2 the book of beginnings Genesis Bereshit in Hebrew in the Torah and I'd like to read two verses from Genesis chapter 2 verse 16 and 17 and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die now on one of the last few programs we talked about the fact that when God created Adam he was placed in what you might call a probationary period in the Garden of Eden and we're now reading in verse 16 and 17 the parameters of this period of probation this is going to be more important to us as we move on in the study I want us to review just a little bit of what we have talked about we we have discovered that man was made to live and to function on to levels the heavenly level the spiritual level through the human spirit and also to function in the earthly level through the realm of the soul and so what we're talking about now is we don't need any practice learning how to live out of our souls we're doing more than enough of that but we feel like that there is a great need among us in our lives as individuals to begin to exercise the gifts to exercise those spiritual senses that have been given to us by God so that we can begin to lean in to the spirit realm we're talking about in the godly sense of the spirit realm and I don't want you to be afraid I want you to watch us very carefully I want you to keep up with the scriptures that we share I don't want anybody to be turned off and feel like we're trying to present something eerie or our new age related I believe what we're sharing is very very biblical I believe that we are just beginning to discover that we were created to function not just survive but function very well on two levels again contacting our earthly environment through our five senses in the realm of the soul and also to contact the spirit realm the heavenly realm and we do that through our spirit man we talked about in Genesis 27 the scripture said and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground that speaks of man's dependency on God when Adam came forth from the fingertips of God in the beginning made in the image and in the likeness of God he was completely and totally dependent on God he lived us in a state of total dependency now after the fall he lost that knowing he lost the knowledge of just how dependent he was on God something in Adam died his spirit man and therefore he was no longer able to function totally completely in both the realm of the earth the earthly realm the natural realm and in the spiritual realm he became let's say he became a very earthbound creature and I'm very concerned about the fact that in the body of Christ too many of us are earthbound and we were not made to be earthbound we were made to soar into the heavens spiritually like the Eagles the New Testament says we have been made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and I believe that that's more than a promise of a future event I believe it's a state of being that God is calling his body into right now the second part of Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 said and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul now we talked about that at the very base of that word breathe breath this word life it's really in the plural and instead of saying and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life in Hebrew that word would be plural and it would be the breath of lives lives plural and we believe that that is a very clear indication that when God breathed into Adam he was given both life in the soul realm the soul at we are tryin remember we've already touched on that at the very beginning what is man he is spirit soul and body God formed Adam out of the dust of the earth he formed his body from the dust of the earth but Adam did not become a living creature until God breathed the breath of lives do you understand and breath of lives cost Adam in English it says to become a living soul but we understand that he became triune he became also now soul and spirit he was not made from clay we talked about that he was made from dust and the very root of the word dust speaks up dependency and needing God depending on God for his source of life now the scripture that we read at the beginning Genesis 2 16 and 17 talks about the probationary period Adam could not learn to walk in this dependency until he had the opportunity to become independent you understand that in order for him to develop this this lifestyle of dependency God said I'm going to give him free will I'm going to allow him to choose whether or not he wants to live a life of dependency or whether or not he wants to feel independent and of course you know what happened by walking in dependency to God his spirit would have continued to commune with God forever for the rest of his life he would have enjoyed the the soul realm the the soul life but he would have also been able to continue to maintain his spirit life so his spirit life would have grown and expanded you see we we read about this communion I tell you i love it when i think about the the ability that God gave Adam God came down in the cool of the day in the cool of the evening and walked with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden what communion what communication what fellowship what relationship Adam totally dependent on his creator but we know what happened we understand what Satan did it was a part of Satan's selfish ambition he said I'm going to ascend I'm going to saw myself above the throne of the Living God and so Satan found an instrument in the garden the serpent and by the way we believe and have every indication to believe that the serpent was not originally a slithering snake on the ground but an upright creature and made very much like the man but did not have sole life in spirit life but made probably very much like an upright creature like the man the the enemy Satan entered into this serpent and the serpent then became a vessel of Satan and he he spewed the lies of the enemy Eve was the first to buy in to those lies and for the purpose of this study we won't go so deeply into that interchange but read it for yourself in the first few chapters of the book of Genesis you'll find out that that the serpent Satan through the serpent told a lie but this lie had some portion of truth and this is how the enemy operates today he lies and deceives but mixed in the deception there is always some truth and that's why we as Christians we as believers need an absolute we need the Word of God and so when I speak to you about the spirit realm when I speak about spiritual gifts when I talk to you or teach about the supernatural visions dreams angels all of this wonderful realm this wonderful realm that you and I were created to function very freely and very naturally in when we start talking about it make sure that you take time to be aburian to be a diligent student of the word and don't you take my word for it you take these things back to the scripture because God has given us an absolute in his word when you hear teaching or preaching that seems a bit unfamiliar don't immediately just cast it out because the cherry pie may have a pit in it you just spit out the it but you keep the pie and the way we do that is by judging everything by the Word of God all the spiritual gifts are to be judged by the word and so we need that maturity in the body of Christ that way we don't get sidetracked we don't get deceived we don't get too far off and I encourage people to check me out I want you to do that I don't believe that God's people should be gullible I don't think we should swallow everything that comes to us in the name of gospel preaching I think we need to not be critical but I think we need to be careful and we need to analyze everything and that's that's ever more the reason why we need to be walking in the spirit realm because the Spirit helps us these Spirit the Holy Spirit of God helps us to discern and to know what the word even says because you could take the word out of context and misjudge something that's going on in your life so we want to be very careful I don't believe that God's people should walk in fear I believe we need to walk in faith and I believe we need to walk in confidence but I do think it would be a good idea for every one of you as believers to pray the prayer that I pray often that God will let me walk in the discerning of spirits that he will give me the anointing of the tzaddik priesthood to be able to discern carefully wisely between that which is holy and that would just profane and I believe that's a very important i'm a little bit off my subject but but i think that's an important teaching i think we need to look into that I really do now when Adam partook of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil the part of adam that was spirit life now because the Bible said if you partake of this tree you're going to die you're going to surely die remember verse 17 talks about that for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die now Adam did not die his body did not die his soul who did not die but the part of adam that was spirit life died and i want you to know that's a miserable existence it's kind of like this thought if you don't know what you're missing you don't know what you're missing but Adam did you see Adam had once walked in this triune existence spirit soul and body and he had been able to communicate with God on both levels the realm of the earthly and the realm of the heavenly now this spirit life that was in Adam died and it had to be restored listen I believe everything changed for Adam I really do but i believe it was all a part of God's plan for you and I to learn that we are dependent we are we must walk and and even celebrate our dependency on God we want to be so sufficient in ourselves but listen look what a mess we made of our lives when we were in charge we are dependent on our Creator but that's not something to despise it's something to celebrate look what a price he paid to pay the price to cover our sins to become our propitiation for sin he gave his own life and his own life's blood now in Genesis chapter 3 verse 8 the first part said and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day now this happened every day this was the daily fellowship that Adam had with his creator but on this particular day the reaction was different Eve had listened to the lie of the serpent Satan lying through the serpent she had partook of this fruit there's an age-old debate what was the fruit was it an apple was it an epic OTT was it a pair was it a tangerine and I think if you're thinking along those lines you're missing the whole story of the Garden of Eden I remember a great man of God profit in fact who has gone on to be with the Lord many years ago brother Branham he was preaching a little bit about this one time and he said well they tell me that it was an apple and they ate the apple and their eyes were opened and they saw they were naked he said if that is the case I think we need to pass out the apples he was talking about immodesty he was talking about how people were were coming along to to go more and more naked in public and not be you know concerned about covering their bodies and so forth this was in the 50s and 60s it's worse now much much worse and so I think I'll just echo if it if it's not too offensive to you and even if it is I think I'll just echo the words of a great man of God and I'll say that if eating apples would cause everyone to know that they needed to be a little more modest in their lifestyle and behavior I'd say pass the apples if you're looking at to it as a natural fruit I think you're really missing the whole story of what happened and it's a debate that perhaps will always be argued but but really irrelevant really it's it's sort of irrelevant it's a spiritual thing that took place just like Adam didn't die in the natural he died in his spirit his spirit life died and and this is very tragic we understand also from the scripture we've taught on this program many times before that the Bible clearly tells us Adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived well what does that mean it means that Adam knew exactly what he was doing somebody said well doesn't that make Adam a greater sinner than Eve well I wouldn't say it that way but I tell you what it did it made a beautiful type of what Christ the last Adam was going to do Adam the first Adam saw what Eve had done he partook with her in her sin as a covering the Apostle tells us in the New Testament Jesus the same way though he were not a sinner he was not a sinner he bore our sin he carried it to the cross in other words he became guilty for us Adam became guilty out of his love for Eve the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua HaMashiach the Messiah he became guilty because of his love for us oh I can't say those words without it touching my heart the the price the sacrifice Oh what love we as humans are we have a hard time understanding comprehending that kind of love we're not talking about filial love natural love human love which is a powerful force I'm not in any way under estimating the power of human love a mother's love the love for a husband to his wife and and so forth but it doesn't begin to compare with the boundless infinite unconditional love of God maybe you don't understand maybe you've never really even been told where you live in your culture in your ethnic background maybe you're watching this program and you don't understand how your father loved you so much that he came down he condescended into a human body the Lord Jesus Yeshua died on a cross paid the price with his own blood so that you can be redeemed back to God back to the state of being that Adam had and even a higher life than Adam had in the beginning so that you could be both soul life and spirit life while you're living in your earthly body while I'm getting a little bit off track again but when I start talking about the love of God and the price that he paid it behooves every one of us to surrender and to serve the Lord with everything that we have because he has certainly done a unbelievable thing for us now it says here in Genesis 38 the second part of that verse and Adam and his wife hid themselves every time before they enjoyed this companionship with their Creator in the cool of the evening now the voice of God comes calling and they hide from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden what happened Eve had disobeyed Adam had entered into her disobedience and Adam and Eve had lost their spirit life their eyes were opened and they saw that they were naked they were ashamed and they hid themselves from the Living God now listen to this without this impartation of spirit that had been breathed into Adam he was but dust he was only dust and could not cleave to anyone neither could he have entered into the purpose for which he had been created just as a body and even just as a soul he would not have been able to enter into the purpose for which he was created but because of what the breath of God did it gave him so life yes but it gave him spirit life it brought him into a place of alignment with God and because of that he could enter into his destiny now if your spirit life has not been restored if you've not experienced resurrection in your spirit life then you will not be able to enter into the fullness of your destiny and function as God has created you and designed you to function so we need to look at how is it that we come into that resurrection or renewal of spirit life we want to find out and once we understand how to get that life in us again how do we develop that life how do we exercise the senses of our spirit life so that we come in to that place of oneness and union and communion with God you see I believe it won't just be an Adam and Eve in the garden communing in oneness in fellowship in relationship with God I believe there is a many membered body a company of believers those who are called to overcome who will begin to enter into this place of manifesting that you are a son of God coming into full adoption and with that you will have the authority of your father to conduct his business on planet earth talk about deliverance talk about captives being set free and healings and miracles and creative manifestations of the word that is the season that God is calling us into right now the natural man the earthly man who is body and soul cannot cleave independency it's not any there's something that's got to be added to him and that is spirit life the resurrection of his spirit life restoring us back to that place where Adam walked with God in the beginning it takes an act of redemption it takes a release of the Spirit of God into you to resurrect your spirit to give you the power and the authority and so it takes an act of redemption the Creator restoring what was lost in the fall we read about that the the Spirit of God the Lord God breathed into him I like John chapter 20 and verse 22 we read that and maybe we should look at it here we've got just it well let me read verse 22 and then close and when he had said this he breathed on them and said to them receive you the Holy Spirit do you notice it's the same way you received the spirit Adam received the spirit by breath and here we read about Jesus breathing on them and they received the Spirit of God there was an awakening there was a resurrection there was a quickening of the human spirit when the Holy Spirit came rushing in I want to pray for you right now as we go off the air father in the name of Jesus I thank you Lord that you've given us this opportunity to lay some more foundation and some groundwork for some of the things that we're going to share in the near future thank you for the anointing that's with us right here today and I pray for healing to the sick and the oppressed and I pray for resurrection life to quicken to awaken the spirit life of every man woman boy or girl who's watching this program today let revival let revolution break forth in our world in the nations of the world right now for the glory of God we ask it in the name of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ I want to thank you for watching the Eagles cry and I hope you'll tune in again next time we're going to do some more studying god bless you bye bye for now [Music] you [Music]
