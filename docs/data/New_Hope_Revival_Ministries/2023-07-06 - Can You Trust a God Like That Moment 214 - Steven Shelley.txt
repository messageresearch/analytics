Description:
Although we may be a minority, with God we become a majority!  One man and God can triumph over a thousand.  One man and God put Satan on the run.  Stand up for God and see, one man and God can win the victory.

Yes, Christians suffer, they can get cancer or high blood pressure, go through things, but God doesn’t allow those things to destroy us, He allows it to bring us to the end of self and surrender to Him.
