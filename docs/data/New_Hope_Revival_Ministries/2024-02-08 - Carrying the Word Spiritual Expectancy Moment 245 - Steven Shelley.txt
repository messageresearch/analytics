TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now to those that have been around people who women that are expecting they watch things change in their lives yes and things start to change pretty quickly whenever they're with child yes you know a lot of times their diet changes and things that they used to like to eat now they don't like it so much or their body starts rejec ing the things that they're trying to put in and the body says no that's not what I need that's not what I want and get that trash out of here and that's what it's what their body will do it will dictate to you I can't take that in anymore dur in this time of my life because there's a different life that's inside of me and the life that's inside of me is dictating what I can consume heard it the life that's inside of me is dictating that I can't eat certain things anymore I have to look at changing my diet yes sir there's even things that places that a pregnant woman can't go right you go to a a theme park and they would have signs that would tell you that you know don't ride this ride if you're pregnant because we want you to protect the life that that is inside of you so be careful where you're going because we need you to protect that right now takes precedence yes whenever you're pregnant the life that is growing inside of you takes precedence over everything you have to listen to that it it will dictate what's going on you you'll find that you'll Place restrictions upon yourself because of that life that's inside of you amen and if you you you watch pregnant women as they as they progress you'll see that their walk changes you you'll see that that that that maybe they don't walk as they normally did they they kind of move a little bit and you want to say water but you a I was thinking that word I didn't know if it was allowed I don't want to be offensive but it it's mean it's it's a it's a waddle um that that takes place and I mean I i' I've watched it um multiple times in in our home and there is a change oh yes in the way that they walk and that change was because they're expecting there's a new life that's growing there's an inward change that's good brother that starts to make an outward expression right right because of the inward change things on the outside will be changing as well but see in the early stages it's hard to tell that's right that's right but you give it a little bit of time uhhuh and then it becomes very apparent that there is definitely something different about that person there is a real life that is developing inside of them yes and that life is changing them come on now and it's becomes very apparent amen and you can tell that they are expecting and it shows if you become pregnant with the word of God you say well finally he's going to preach now I've been preaching the whole time been preaching the whole time when we become pregnant with his word you'll find that there's changes that happen in your life if you're not finding changes taking place I question whether or not you have been impregnated by the word of God if you can still do all the things that you have always done if you can still go to all the places that you've always went if you can still have the same conversations that's right it might get stick but if you can still have the same kind of conversations that you've always had see cuz when a pregnant woman when she's pregnant in that home the conversations change the conversations are concentrated around that life right and pretty much wherever she goes at some point the conversation is going to start is going to twist around and turn to the pregnancy yes and the the life that's living inside of her yes sir but if we can say we can stand here and say I've been impregnated by the word and yet we don't have any changes going on in our life our conversation never goes back to the word I question that because I I I know I you get around people and it doesn't take long just listening to their conversations you'll find out what their passions are in life
