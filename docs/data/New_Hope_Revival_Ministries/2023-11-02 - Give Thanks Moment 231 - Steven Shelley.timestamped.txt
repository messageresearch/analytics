[0:00] when you are giving God
[0:02] Thanksgiving when you are extending your
[0:05] hand to him you're not just saying thank
[0:07] you sir you're saying I believe that you
[0:11] are good and I believe that you are
[0:15] faithful and I believe that every good
[0:18] thing that happens to me is because of
[0:20] you and I believe that you will never
[0:23] leave me nor forsake me and I believe
[0:26] that you will go with me even to the end
[0:28] of the Earth and I believe that though I
[0:30] Ascend into heaven you're there though I
[0:32] make my bed in hell you're there and I
[0:35] believe it goes on and on and on and on
[0:37] and on it is an avowal it is a statement
[0:41] that says I believe this is the truth
[0:45] that I
[0:46] believe an avow also means an honest
[0:51] admission I'm just honestly expressing
[0:55] that I can't make it without you I if
[1:00] you will order your
[1:02] conversation if you will not allow your
[1:06] math to
[1:07] overload the rest of you if you will
[1:11] choose your words wisely and offer God
[1:15] praise that's du his name while choosing
[1:18] your words in life words that edify
[1:22] words that glorify not words that that
[1:25] murmur and complain and belly ache help
[1:28] me now so both of these verses Psalm 504
[1:34] and 15 and Psalm
[1:36] 5023 use the word toada emphasizing as a
[1:41] sacrifice and the sacrifice is what you
[1:44] are offering ahead of time it's not the
[1:48] kind of sacrifice that you commit a
[1:51] transgression and you bring an offering
[1:54] to cover what's already done it's a
[1:56] Thanksgiving offering and in a
[1:58] Thanksgiving offering you are offering
[2:01] God Advance praise you're offering God
[2:04] thanks in advance for what he is going
[2:07] to do you don't wait until the victory
[2:10] comes to
[2:13] dance you don't wait for the sun to
[2:15] shine to dance you dance in the rain
[2:18] you've give God praise now you don't
[2:21] wait for the day you've praised him in
[2:23] the night your reputation will precede
[2:26] you when you're a
[2:28] murmurer hello
[2:30] your reputation will precede you when
[2:33] you're a
[2:34] praiser you're going to be one of the
[2:37] other you're either going to be a
[2:38] complainer or you're going to be a
[2:40] praiser I
[2:43] choose oh my God I choose today
[2:48] Lord not to complain even though there's
[2:51] things to complain
[2:53] about I choose to come with a praise I
[2:57] choose to leave here with a praise I
[3:01] choose to live by weak with the
[3:07] praise some people are
[3:09] complainers and some are praisers and
[3:13] the real question
[3:15] is which one are
[3:18] [Music]
[3:23] you
