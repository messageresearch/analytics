glad to see you in the house of the lord and we're blessed to have brother dwayne jackson and his family with us here today we want to invite him at this time to come and sing and worship the lord and we're going to just continue worshiping as he is singing you know all that we do and all that we say we want it to bring honor and glory to the risen savior the one that came up out of the grave he's no longer there and he said i'll give you power over all of the power of the enemy i'm thankful that his power is still for the people of god in the end time what a wonderful time oh i better not take a text this morning we would uh we wouldn't get out of here till tomorrow i tell you just the uh the anointing is so rich so rich i tell you last evening how the lord just come down and and moved among us well maybe he didn't for you but he did for me i thought you might be a little more excited maybe you're still sleepy and tired this morning but he moved for me last night hallelujah i'm so thankful i'm so thankful that he knows exactly where we are brother steve i know he knows the need that we have brother brooks and he comes down and he speaks to each one of us personally to the need that you have you know brother isaiah can't come and know everything that is going on in everybody's lives but my god sure does and he can take a message that can come from one man and speak to hundreds this morning to every individual need and and i well i was going to sing this song but i think i'm going to sing a different song maybe we'll sing the other one in a minute too if it would be the lord's will but as i think of of christ coming to us you know i i there's a song and if y'all have the words to it i'm not a person that likes to sing by myself i like to worship with people and i'm very envious of brother benjamin this morning and how he his voice just continues to go and go and and yeah and i don't have that anymore it seems like it it goes out pretty quick but um if you all have the words to uh he came to me i don't know if y'all have the words you can put it on the screen or not but um you know i was i was thinking about that last evening as he did come to us as he came down and spoke to my heart spoke to your heart i believe and and the thing is is as steve as i looked in the the scripture i see many times that other people would come to him and they would have a need of him and many times they would go away sad but it's a special time when he chose to go to them when he said i have needs to go by samaria he had a need to come by my place he had a need his need was you and that's what drew him the need that you have some people think there's they're too needy in their life and that that pushes people away but it doesn't push him away your need is what attracts him to you this morning and i'm so thankful that the song says he came to me when i could not come to where he was he came to me would you help me sing if they have the words to it um key of c i believe we'll try that the gulf that separates me from christ my lord oh it was so vast the crawl i could never fall [Music] from where i was to here domain it seems so far oh i cried dear lord i can't come to where you are [Music] but he came to me [Music] he came to me [Applause] when i could not come to where he was he came to me [Music] oh that's why he died i'm the reason he died for when i could not come to where he was he came to me [Music] oh he came to me when i was bound with chains of sins oh he came to me he did not leave me there oh he picked me up and drew me gently to his side oh where today in his sweet love i now abide for he came to me to where he was he came to me [Music] oh that's why he died for when i couldn't come to where he was he came to me aren't you happy about it this morning oh he came to oh hallelujah he came to me when i couldn't come to where he was thank god he came down to me glory oh that's why he [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh when i oh he came to me thank god hallelujah [Music] when i oh i see that i'm the reason [Applause] i'm so thankful you did it for me lord when i couldn't come to where he was he came to me [Music] hallelujah praise your name lord jesus hallelujah oh i'm so thankful for what he's done for me i'm so thankful how he set me free i'm so thankful that he put my feet on the right path and he keeps leading me he didn't start me out and leave me alone he's right there with me this morning he's not going to leave me alone he's going to keep going it doesn't matter what trial that i'm in doesn't matter what fire that i'm facing the song said he's stealing the fire you may be facing a fire but my god still in it he said he's jehovah's shama what's jehovah sharma i'm there i don't care where there is for you this morning he is there it doesn't matter where you're going to where there is he says i'm jehovah shama i'm already there no matter what the problem is this morning i'm already there give me the key of g y'all can sing too if you know the song help me sing it this morning will my mama read a story from the bible long ago about shadrach meshach and allah pandey go how the wicked king commanded they be thrown into the flame because they wouldn't bow and then deny their father's name but my mama said the king stood high on the balcony so tall when he looked in he was shocked by all the things that he saw where he thought that he would find him lying dead upon the ground but instead of three he counted for people walking all around oh he's still in the fire and he's walking in the plains and he'll be there to help you if you call in jesus name and he can still deliver by his own mighty power while here below it's good to know he's still in the fire then i said mama wait a minute there's one thing that i must know if three went in and three came out then where'd the fourth man go but i never will forget my destiny floor these are the words that i heard say she's shouted through the door

brother brooks has told you the same thing we preachers have the same issues but we have to fight the same battles but oh when something the presence of the lord gives us courage to just kick it back to the curb no that's not mine that isn't mine no that thought's not mine i know where that came from oh friends [Music] i questioned my own self when brother brooks was preaching last night why do i entertain something that i know isn't mine mindsets but all the grace of god hallelujah you can have your seats today the grace of god gives us the courage and he comes by our way in meetings like

believe him jesus hallelujah remain standing if you're able add above the glory be to jesus glory be to jesus whoa hallelujah praise the lord i might not be able to tell it you can be seated i might not be able to tell it like it's in my heart just play something soft would you i this wasn't in my mind i wasn't even thinking this when i felt the unction of the lord come and had i had the strength i believe there would have been more that i could have yielded to let me see the hand of every visitor this is not your regular church on sunday hold up your hand there's a lot of you here and you just don't know what we saw the enemy do some years back and we're not going to brag on him he doesn't get any any credit does he but uh he sent an attack against our young people many years ago and it was it was hard it was hard for everybody and we recovered by survival but not really by overcoming you know there's a difference you can survive and then you can overcome and then about 2014 we as a whole church went through the hardest one of the hardest trials that we have ever gone through as a body of believers and we lost a lot both naturally and more importantly spiritually and one of the things that we lost was our youth choir and they sang maybe a few of them are different variations but not much in all these years and i didn't even know i didn't even think that i wasn't even thinking on it when i felt the inspiration of the lord but i felt the lord wanted to speak to them and to this body and i thought you visitors had a right to know that they did they only practiced three times or something like that but what you just saw was the answer to a lot of prayers a lot of saints here have fasted and prayed for our young people and prayed that god would make a way that they would just have the desire you can drive them to do something you can push them to do something pull them to do something but the lord has to drop it in at the right time and god laid that song on megan jovich's heart and she started doing everything she could and sister laurel she asked sister laurel to help and different ones and the next thing you know they were together again some of them married now some of them with children now some of them the next generation some of them carrying babies right now when they used to be babies but i can't tell you how full my heart is right now i believe the word of the lord i believe that god is restoring something i believe god is going to do something in their lives would you just give god praise with us right now oh jesus we pray for every one of them lord we lift them up right now in the name of jesus that you will indeed keep your promise to them lord fill them so full of the holy ghost and fire take from them the desire of this world and let them love you only jesus hallelujah [Applause] thank you for giving me that moment to tell you what i believe the lord was saying this has been a time of circles and cycles and seasons and we don't have time this morning because we want brother brooks to come and take all the time he needs but some of you would marvel if you knew what the lord was doing behind the scenes just confirming some of those circles and cycles and connections and we had been talking in my home the saints from indiana and we were sharing some things that we had seen the lord connecting and putting together and we shared about a particular family and they knew the family i knew the family they knew the family many years ago and we it just made such a beautiful connection and we started reminiscing and talking about some things and unbeknownst to us last night after we went home i'm walking in the door and that sister who is not here not in her home she's visiting way off in ohio some for some reason she was streaming the service last night and i don't know if she'd ever streamed a service before i don't know she's ever streamed a service before and she was so blessed by seeing the liberty she's actually in amish country right now with with friends and family and connections and she said oh i wish those people that are around me here could have the freedom and the joy that i saw those people celebrating and having last night it was inspiration to her and we marveled we marveled in just calling her name we marveled that she saw the service and reached out and it's just things that you can't really explain but god is doing some beautiful things because he's a beautiful god and we've been blessed this week brother brooks has given his all and sister ruby has been so much support for him i think he is a stronger man and more at peace when sister ruby is with him we have reaped the benefit of him having his wife precious companion with him here it makes a difference doesn't it brother and when when i looked up and saw her going around this church it so touched me and i just said lord that's that she's like my mama would you pour your holy ghost on her strengthen her for the journey the life of a pastor's wife is a difficult life with lots of misunderstandings and a lot of vicious attacks i know because i live with one but i'm so thankful that god touched her she's given of herself i'm glad that god touched her today i want you to ask the lord what he would have you to sow we usually don't do two in one service maybe last night we were just going to do an offering for brother brooks and when i realized that i hadn't done it i started fretting a little bit in the in the flesh and i said oh lord please don't let it be that i have cheated him out of what he would have gotten and then i thought that's the most carnal thing to think even that thought i felt like the lord was just saying trust me so i'm trusting him today if you will ask the lord what he would have you to give every penny every dollar to will go directly to brother brooks and if you make it out to the church then we will of course then write the check and every bit of it every part of it will go directly to him you'll be sowing right into his ministry would you stand again do you feel able i'm afraid if i sit down i might not get back up lord we have been the beneficiaries of a great gift that you have given to the body of christ and for three years or more now we have feasted at the table that you have prepared in him and once again this year we have really really really enjoyed the strength of the word it comes with authority and more importantly it comes with integrity and this is what we really admire in our brother his ability to get out of the way and let you use him and we admire his integrity before you so we ask that you would receive this offering we give it unto you lord in the name of your servant that their needs might be met that they might be blessed that they might receive a a double reward for giving to us and making the sacrifice of such a long journey so i ask that you bless the gift and the giver that you multiply this offering in in beautiful and witty ways so that it even spins larger lord i pray that if there's things they need to purchase they'll be on sale i pray there'll be coupons and discounts so that this offering will go farther than it would have ever gone this is our desire we want them blessed so we give this in your name in the name of the lord jesus christ and for your glory and the saints said amen let's see two of austin you're in the aisle you come and my eyes are somebody else come who's coming michael i don't know how i missed you michael with that nice red shirt on i want you to bring it if you don't feel like coming send it where's the other bag can we oh there he comes stephen we want you to march up here you don't have to march literally march but we want you to come up here put your offering in this bag and as you do whisper a prayer for brother brooks in just a moment that he will come and give us everything that the lord would have for us today what a day that will be what a day that will be in my jesus i shall see when i look upon his face will you worship so that we keep the atmosphere [Music] just give him some praise he takes me by the hand leads me through the promised land oh what a day what a glorious day that will be sing this verse there'll be no sorrow there no more birds to bear no more sickness no pain [Music] who died for me oh what a day what a glorious day that will be singing out one day what a day that will be when my jesus oh when i look upon his face the one who saved me oh and he takes me by the hand leads [Music] if i wait till the end of the service you may be out and i may forget i want to also say along with brother greeley that we are so thankful for everything that you have done in this camp meeting our sisters have cooked nearly day and night so many of them have stepped up and even filled in for others who couldn't or didn't and have really labored and the food has been fabulous the fellowship even better than the food but we don't take that for granted as though you owe us something we know that you did that unto the lord and i want you to know it has been much appreciated by everyone who has partook and been blessed by it brother and sister greeley opened up the basement of their home for some of our brothers and sisters from indiana to stay in and we're so thankful for that we've had great fellowship with them every evening in our home spilling out into the yard and the porch and the patio because it's not the biggest of places to gather but we've made it and i want you to know it'll be oh there she is i thought i was gonna say it'll be easier to say with her not being in here but i am one of the most blessed men in the whole wide world because i have one of the greatest wives that any man could ever have he has so blessed me [Applause] even though others were cooking and providing in that last minute day and night she would say i'm not sure i better go make another pot pie i better go make another i better make sure and this morning when we got up we could hardly roll out of bed but by the time i got up she made it before me the kitchen was already spread out with food and she was cooking again and has opened uh her home i'll say because she's the one that does all the painting and the fixing she's the repair man at our house and we have enjoyed it so much i want to honor her and tell you sweetheart i love you very very much and i'm thankful for what you've done what a day that will be when my cheeks i shall see when i look [Music] peace [Music] oh i just so thank god for being here most of all i thank god for his presence because you can have thousands of people and yet it can be void of the presence of the lord but when he comes amen it's a miracle and such a blessing and it's uh you know it just all it it it makes you a junkie you know it makes you want more and more and more of him and uh you know we just thank the lord for brother shelley and his wife she has been excellent as he said and you know i i just love it when my wife clicks with another sister and they're clicking [Music] i get so excited because you know as they say um many of the uh pastors wives they don't have too many friends and and i don't know why that is the way it is but it is but i thank god for i don't know all the pastor's wives especially for mine and he's correct i'm a better man when she's here [Music] amen so i thank god for my wife and you don't know what the sacrifice is for her because she's she's has been in the past terrified of flying but i know her

be and one night as she laid quietly [Music] the spirit of the lord overshadowed her and said that you'll conceive a child that sin cannot defile and she said be unto me according to thy word and she kept these things and pondered them deep within her heart she believed in god when he said that something new was going to start oh if the world could be born in mary [Music] [Applause] [Music] virgin pride to be saved through the blood of calvary [Music] and in this time of darkness we have come [Music] received a vindicated word oh that we all have heard it i can see it being born in you and me cause we've kept these things [Music] and pondered them deep within our hearts hallelujah we've stayed with the lord never one time felt desire to the part hallelujah oh yes the world have been born

and i can see it being [Music] in you and [Music] as we stand god is so good to us personally i feel a rapture coming on i don't say that just to be saying it and i love that song i don't the you know youth choir song i don't know who wrote it but it's wonderful it really gave the devil a gives the devil a black eye it makes him know yes sir the battle ain't over yet and i love it the way god did it you knew he took a woman the bride of christ to beat the devil with it's like a man in his house and a man outside boasting and telling how he's going to beat him he says hon go out there that's my light work it's humiliating when you see a woman get beat up a man get beat up by a woman and i i've seen it happen [Music] fort jackson south carolina on the military base i saw a woman be the man both of them were sergeant i don't know which one of them got court-martialed but the lady was the sister was she she was saying don't don't don't do that don't do that and he kept going and i think he threw the first point punch and she beat him personally i would have went awol i'll never forget it i was just a boy and you could tell she had she either studied or she had some brothers because she put it on him and i don't know how he went back to his platoon i don't know but as we stand every time i think about that i think about the bride of christ whipping the devil [Music] hallelujah as we stand let us turn to proverbs 3 please so good seeing my brother dwayne and he still got it we thank god for the songs it's been so many years since i've seen him you know but it's always good to see people you haven't seen in a long time i i get i get really teared up and the reason being is because so many has fallen away and you know i unite with anybody that really fight with jesus and stands for jesus you know i i know people have their issues but i don't care what denomination they belong with and belong to when they name the name of jesus they get my attention because i was once there but because i was there did not change who i am now i am who i was there right so you got to understand we make our transitions but the transitions doesn't change who we are because we were bribed before the foundation of the world and uh you know i always ask people i said you know let me read the scripture first i apologize but you know i tell people i said you know they always talking about the prophet of god i said well where was the prophet when he received the holy ghost what church he was going to that's all i'm saying it doesn't matter where the eagle is born he'll be born under dog as long as they present the right atmosphere the egg will hatch that's what your prophecy is so anyway it's the truth but i appreciate the lord jesus and his his grace toward me and his grace toward the people of god and and um i keep telling people you know it's amazing because i they look at me like i'm crazy i said what basically do you want me to stop everything i'm doing no no no no do what you're doing but there's something that you must do in order for this translation to occur i love that song he's resurrecting me he he robbed the graves and uh he's there's a resurrection going on me and i trust that everybody be able to see happening within me proverbs 3. we're going to read the fifth verse trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not unto thine own understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path let us pray heavenly father we come before you we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us lord god we thank you for being our all and all lord you've been good to us you've been been better to us than we've been to ourselves and father there is no words to express our gratitude lord i thank you father for just being uh so sweet and rich to us this weekend and lord i know there are those that have been changed but yet and still i feel like there could be some more changes and father there's nothing that i can do but i know that you're still the god amen of all creation and father we pray that you create in us a clean heart creating us lord the right spirit creating us oh god yourself bless us now in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated i know we've come and i'm some of us are tired and you know and but but i trust by god grace that god will give us enough energy to just hear the word of god this morning you and i must understand that we're living in a time and and we've seen the anointing and my was it wonderful uh the days ahead before and it is now this morning but something came to my mind something came to my mind and i began to think about the anointing and how you know the rain fall right and and you know i remember when i was a little boy uh walking in the rain it was wonderful back in the day you can you the rain was you could appreciate it you didn't have to worry about catching some kind of disease but now they because of the pollution and things like that you don't know what's falling on your head but nevertheless i can remember the time when and i love rain to this day i love to play in the rain i love to play in the water and my grandkids like that they love rain they love water they love pools and you know and things of that nature but the thing that that really would get me sometimes you know and i know all kids do it especially on a nice summer day or somewhere where it's raining the rain is falling and you say get out of that rain but before they get out of the rain they do this they don't want the rain just on the outside they want it on the inside and so when i was thinking about that this morning i said lord i don't want the anointing of your anointing just to fall on the outside i want that anointing on the inside and when i began to think about that anointing i thought about the ark of the covenant and i thought about all of the instruments in the ark of the covenant was anointed and that occurred a covenant that represented you and i it was a replica of the human um body or man and everything in us is supposed to be anointed did you understand that then i saw where brother branham was talking about the blood of jesus christ and he said the blood of jesus christ he said the blood was anointed and he said that anointing represents christ so therefore jesus's blood had the spirit of christ in it hallelujah now if god did it for him he can do it for us you see because the holy ghost when it comes it's not only supposed to anoint your spirit and anoint your body but it's supposed to anoint your soul and when that life comes in you it anoints your blood hallelujah what are you talking about brother brooks with the anointing of god on the inside amen we have how could i say it we have an advantage of the devil because the devil has to come in in order to fl afflict us but when we got the blood when we got the anointing on the inside it will fight for us you hear what i'm saying it is the thing that causes everything that's perverted to be kicked out it's kind of like the white blood cells right they're there as an army to protect us from all germs hallelujah i normally don't get hoarse but uh we're gonna keep going god is good to us when we think about being anointed i i told the lord i said you know they poured oil on david's head and they poured oil on aaron's head and and the bible said when the oil ran down from his head all the way down to his feet so he was totally anointed on the outside hallelujah but that same oil is to be anointed is to be poured on the inside you say what do you mean because the uh the vessels in the hole in the in the temple of god was anointed i want my eyes to be anointed i want my brain to be anointed i want my heart to be anointed i want every instrument in my body to be anointed hallelujah so much so that when god says change i'll change god is so good to us when we talk about and this is where i believe the lord is speaking to my heart and he spoke that we need to trust him trust him more as long as you worry you don't trust him because worry is the absence of trust and whenever you worry you're not trusting him i'll say it again no matter what comes your way the bible says in all things give what thanks if you want to keep yourself he says lord i need to be more consecrated and when we say consecration we said lord i want to be more dedicated i want to be more devoted i want to be more faithful but we're being more dedicated more faithful and more devoted amen to what the word you've heard me say throughout the meaning meeting i am a worshiper of the word and whatever the word says that i'll humble myself to because in the beginning was the word the word with god and the word was god hallelujah but we must learn how to trust god with all allah of our hearts not some of it all of it and it comes by trial sometimes you don't even know where you stand when it comes to god but god will allow trials to come to see where you stand so that you can see where you stand is that right and when those trials come amen then you'll be able to see am i trusting god because the moment you stress you're not trusting god did not cause us to stress stress works against your body that's why so many people are sick because of stress we were not designed to be stressful we are designed a man to rest in god hallelujah and i believe that on this oncoming storm and i don't know whether you see it or not but it's coming and many hearts will faint and fail because of fear when you fear you're not trusting god when you see the things coming upon the earth you're not trusting god now i'm not trying to say that the devil doesn't present fear but the bible said perfect love casts out fear you understand me so when these fears comes upon you you must understand that the perfect love casts it out i often wondered what that was until i had an experience and i don't know whether i was here the last time when i talked about the american airline but i was on that plane and that plane they said was getting ready or they tried to say it in a nice way but they didn't want to say we're getting ready to crash but they basically said we're losing altitude and uh the uh the the airline stewardess was very very nervous but i was reading a spoken word book and i was just praying and having a good time and and she came back and she saw something i didn't see and she kept talking to another man and she come back to me and she says what is that and i don't know what she was talking about but she was pointing to something above my head and she said she went away and she came again she said i see a she started to say light but she caught herself and then she came back again and she said you're different you're different now this was before they announced we were getting ready to crash right so anyway i'm looking at this thing and i'm just looking at this woman and and and then all of a sudden she goes back this way and she comes back again and she says everybody buckle up and you know she started going through her her drama trying not to be afraid but she was terrified and she kept looking at me and i just well i knew something was going to happen before we started out because it wasn't working right in the beginning and i thought to myself just as soon as we get up there this thing is going to fall or faint and it happened i did not speak it but it did happen i'm just sharing how perfect love casts out fear i'm sharing because here it was i'm looking this is the winter time i'm looking outside of the the the the window and all i could see was snow and ice and somebody said well where's where are we going to land and she says i don't know the pilot knows and everybody's imagination went wild you could tell because everybody got quiet and i thought i'm gonna tell you something all of a sudden a fear jumped on me [Music] i could hardly breathe and i said oh god you didn't tell me i was going to die today that's exactly what i said you didn't tell me i was going to die today then all of a sudden as i said that something just snatched that fear out of me and i heard him say perfect love cast out fear see it wasn't me it was the perfect love that made it move you understand what i'm saying it's like when the prophet of god crossed that man's fence and the ball was out there he forgot he reached for his gun and his gun wasn't there what was their fear hallelujah he said but then something happened somebody helped me here something happened and perfect love stepped in and directed every move from that point on and after it was all over he said i wish i could stay there i wish i could be in that kind of anointing forever these are these are paraphrased words but that's what he was saying because it was such an anointing and he understood it was not him same things with the bees is that right same thing he could have been stung to death but all of a sudden perfect love stuff see perfect love is not just a thing it's a person it's christ jesus it's the mighty angel of god standing on your in on your behalf hallelujah [Music] but you see that also comes for being dedicated if you're faithful to god he will be faithful to you so let me move on by god's grace you and i must understand that we have a purpose now our purpose is to prove that malachi 4 was right because malachi 4 wasn't just a man it was god in the man right y'all understand me it was the visitation of the son of man and these son of man came to do what prepare us for a rapture hallelujah but one thing for certain we must come to a place amen that we trust god i'm telling you perfect faith is the faith of jesus christ perfect faith is undisturbed faith whenever the devil comes it you move that's why paul said nothing moves me because paul had entered into a perfect faith and i look at the the seven church ages and we've come through that and people say oh what what you know and i saw that in that church age was it was the regime the original seed that was really planted that means that all of the gifts amen it was in the ephesus age everything but why couldn't they make a rapture because you have not come yet hallelujah and each one even though they had all of those gifts they had the seven virtues otherwise the gospel that's being preached to us it's not equal to what they were being preached but we they had and it's what what they had has now been restored but it doesn't stop there with brethren kindness it must move on up into divine love which is the headstone but in order for us to get there we must learn how to trust god i'm not going to be long so i hope you get on this train i'm not going to be long but the thing that i'm the thing that i i'm using is the prophet's life just for an example because when he was there in the in the mountains and the snowstorm came right and he had already told the other brothers y'all get down quick because when this blizzard strikes he said you know in moments time if you don't know what you're doing you're going to die hallelujah but at the time he started walking happened a voice spoke to him and said turn around y'all hear what i'm saying how many of you would have turned around how many of you would have said that must be the devil but he heard the voice of god telling him to turn around you understand god purposed the storm and purposed him to be in the stone why because he needed a voice to stop the storm you see what i'm saying you say well what do you mean every storm you go through god purposed that storm but he puts you in the storm to stop the stone you must understand the power of the spoken word in the true believer it's no more than god himself speaking through you oh yes it is i was thinking uh the other day let me tell you something if if if this whole church would have really had faith like we should have had there wouldn't have been one person leaving out here undone one thing that jesus taught us is that when we're having prayer services he said basically especially when it's serious let the let those who don't believe you can leave is that right because they hinder the faith of god the people of god in their faith and i don't know whether you can feel it but there are times we're praying for people and as soon as somebody come up their visual that looks like it's difficult to do you can feel the unbelief it's like a wave of unbelief comes through the church and and you don't even know you're hindering the move of god because first of all you don't believe he can do it but i'm here today to tell you that god can do anything but fail i've seen him i've seen god raise the dead twice nobody can take that from me in this message i've seen him do it twice because he's god and if he says i'm the resurrection that's what he means seeing god even gets psyched to the blind yes see that's what people oh brother brandon was the only one that can do that that's nonsense we have a bride we have a people that god has ordained to be born of his bone flesh of his flesh amen to be just like him i believe it i believe that there's a marriage going on there's a union going on between the bride of christ and and the bridegroom hallelujah it's time to move from the bride stage into the stage of the wife [Music] is that right it's time people need to understand that you're joining us with christ but you got to trust the word see trusting the word is trusting god because god is the word hallelujah you love the lord the bible tells us amen that we are seed of promise do you know what that means that god promised you would be here is that right he promised jesus was going to be here he promised john would be here is that right he promised mary would be here did he keep his promise he kept his promise and he promised that in this last day there'll be a bride hallelujah and we are here amen amen hallelujah god is good to us he's better to us than we've been to ourselves hallelujah well i can feel like some i can see that somebody's lost something i should be the most tired person in here but when it comes to god all i need is just one touch hallelujah now we must understand we've never come this way before even though the scene of sodom is here even though the days of noah's here those are conditions that god said the son of man would be revealed and he also tells a story how a bride will be be seen is that right because i'm going to tell you something what we must understand if the first adam had a feminine spirit in him the second one did too there was a bride and the prophet of god says that when let's let's use let's use uh abraham when abraham was put to into a deep sleep and brother brandon talks about that deep sleep he said that was like death right so god took that same kind of deep sleep in genesis and put adam to sleep and that was a type of the death but then after that death came miss eve now she wasn't eve she was adam she had the same authority she had the same uh headship if i can say it like that hallelujah because her headship was adam and they worked together did they not they work together hallelujah and this is what god is trying to get his bride to see he wants to work with you hallelujah and we must understand we cannot count down because of our little infirmities in the flesh the bible says these afflictions are light afflictions we must understand we must stand up rise from the dust whatever whatever was necessary we've gotta you know you know roll our shoulders back and be what we supposed to be hallelujah we can't be all coward like like it was when david got ready to fight the giant amen all of his brothers huddled in the corner scared of the giants scared of the challenge afraid of the challenge and he was a young boy who had experiences who had testimonies what god had already done for him he knew that the same god that killed the lion the same god that killed the bear is the able to kill the giant hallelujah and i know he's able oh yes he is i know he's able and as god pulled miss adam out amen they were they were twain and as i said i think uh earlier in the messages amen when god when adam uh uh saw uh adam uh what did he do with the open word he began to he began to tell who tell her who she was and when the seals were open that was the second adam telling amen his bride who she is hallelujah bone of my bone flesh of my flesh in other words when i was created you were there hallelujah made out of the same substance hallelujah and one thing i want us to understand until this bible amen becomes yours yo absolute it must be your resting place it must be your rock hallelujah it must be your revelation of who god is and once you see who god is you'll see who you are i don't believe i'm just an animal hallelujah and no matter what you think there is not one superior race there's only one superior race and that's the race of jesus christ hallelujah it doesn't matter amen how you look from the outside it's not the outside that god is concerned about it's the inside y'all understand me what was the holies of holies that veil was badger skin badger skin badger skin bad your skin and what we must understand none of us been good none of us are righteous and as long as you in this flesh you never will be it's not the outward thing that god's concerned you're being built from the inside out this flesh has already been judged yes you don't never satisfy it is that the truth oh it's the truth and you and i must understand by god's grace that's not that should not be our attention the attention and the focus that we must have must be the inside the inner man what's happening with him is he growing is he maturing is he coming more into the image of god what's happening here if you're the same that you the way you were last year that means you're not growing and if you're not growing unbelief is somewhere you understand me unbelief here's the growth of the believer hallelujah so you say what it's so amazing how we can all say amen when i talk about david amen hallelujah and then when your challenges come hallelujah let me tell you something david understood one thing he could not do it without the anointing and though he was a boy and though he was young maybe not so mature as he should be he understood he still was a king that's all i'm saying you may not be the matured christian you want to be but you must understand you're still pride you're still the word nothing can change that you are the word hallelujah give me a little more time she's just saying this saying this is a new creation yes yes it's a new creation yes and he and he goes on to say this in the layout and scenes he says but now he is standing in the midst of the church as he stands there revealing who he is in the last age now you got to understand what he's saying revealing who he is you understand me have you anybody seen jesus see all y'all quiet only because you don't have that revelation you should the reason why i say that because i have and when i look at you i see him see that is the new creation god in you somebody help me it's god in you this is the hidden mystery of the seal god in a multi-million member body hallelujah that he called miss jesus christ amen when i see you i see him that's the way it's supposed to be hallelujah see it's this is another creation this has to do with the church but what about that layer to see it but you understand there was something else took place after vasti was thrown away or cast out there was another one god chose and her name was odessa hallelujah after a while she became what esther i love esther when i meet her i'm gonna tell i preached on a lot hallelujah i'm gonna tell after you was my inspiration hallelujah you came from nowhere and became queen hallelujah that's the way it is with us we come from nowhere some of us were on street corners some of us were in drug houses some of us amen was smoking cracking whatever more came from nowhere but now we're sitting in the throne we've been invited to be queen of heaven [Applause] the devil don't like it why because he didn't get a second chance hallelujah he doesn't understand grace because the more we fall the more grace is given [Applause] hallelujah and i'm going to tell you something i'm going to use every bit of it that i have i want his grace i want his mercy i want his love i want everything that he's got to offer hallelujah [Music] this is another creation hallelujah he can't stand it he hates it hallelujah because he knows that the word of god cannot come back void hallelujah yes sir he tried everything to get rid of samson is that right he took his testimony for a while is that right samson was a mighty mighty man available he whipped those philistines from east to west hallelujah but he allowed the world to get in between his relationship in god nothing's wrong with the word it's when you allow the world to get in between you and the word that's when god can't be effective as he should in your life but if you kill the philistine if you kill the delilah in your life you'll see that your strength will be restored i love it yeah i love it because the prophet god said like this he said he said uh uh he was in bad shape samson he said but there's a possibility oh maybe there's a possibility maybe there's a possibility that god would give me a revival but maybe there's a possibility i haven't seen so much that god would give me the holy ghost well maybe there's a possibility amen that i haven't walked out of the will of god so much that god won't heal me there's a possibility let me tell you something you need to take that possibility this morning if you didn't get your victory yesterday get it today take that possibility that god will do for you today what he didn't do yesterday hallelujah you love the lord oh i tell you what people i don't know and i don't know who this is to but i woke up this morning and the word is going to be rough now but i've got to tell that the word incest came to my mind and i thought no lord you know i don't know who you are but it wasn't your fault and god can't deliver you hello you don't have to carry that i'm no prophet but i know when he's talking to me and i'm going to tell you something god wants to deliver you if you didn't get it yesterday take the possibility today [Music] because i'm gonna tell you something those kind of things scar people hallelujah that's why they end up on drugs and alcohol and prostitution and everything else because of those kind those those scars those things amen that makes them feel so unworthy so unclean so unfit and then they try to find love somewhere find love in the wrong places hallelujah you understand god understand your condition hallelujah is that right god saw it when it was happening oh my but it never changed his mind about you if you are seen you are a seed and the devil can't do you no harm don't let the devil hold you in prison don't let the devil amen keep you from worshiping and praising god god is able to wash you he's able to cleanse you he's able to throw your sins all of them in the sea of forgetfulness [Applause] hallelujah you'll spend your whole time of life trying to make yourself look pretty and accepted hallelujah but let me tell you something people don't like you sometimes because they just don't like you you've not you've done nothing wrong sometimes people look at me and i can almost hear them i don't even like you because of the way you look y'all don't know y'all don't hear y'all think i'm crazy but i'm nod but when i tell people i said if i'm not your friend you're the loser you don't like me you're the loser huh not me because i'll be a good friend to you y'all understand me you don't like me that's prob i'm sorry you're the one who loses but anyway let's move on so you can understand by god's grace amen the sermon the topic because we're talking about you know uh not allowing any enemy to to have victory over us and and that's i can't stand it you know and you've heard me say this before people say things to you that's not right and then they won't repent they won't even ask for forgiveness and then they're going about their way being happy but they failed to see they just put you in prison because you allowed them to hello listen if people don't repent and say they're sorry don't you worry about it you just enjoy jesus hallelujah don't let nobody imprison you because they don't like you if they they don't like what you're doing you just go head on and enjoy jesus where would brother branham be if he had to be worried about what people thought about him hallelujah know who you are is that right where would the jews be if they worried about what the world thought about them but they don't care they're literally proud to be jews and they do everything listen people don't understand they want to get rid of them but the society of this world wouldn't be nothing without the jew and you and i must understand it won't be nothing without us too when we leave here chaos coming from everywhere hallelujah what you must understand is that you are the salt of the earth don't lose your effectiveness though you lose your affecting if jesus said you are worthy to be trodden on the feet hallelujah you lose your effectiveness you will be tried the feet hallelujah love the lord that's where the early age left the pentecostal age they they went with all of the gifts and all that nothing was wrong with that but the problem was they weren't willing to go further you got to go all the way we're talking about the perfect statue of christ you must go all the way that means you've got to die daily you got to rot to your thoughts and your ideas hallelujah hello this is what i was saying yesterday lord let your will be done in earth as it is in heaven that's jesus prayer and whatever they won't do in heaven i don't want to do here on earth you got to realize by god's grace how god looks at this thing and understand you got to be one of those people say well lord i believe mary had no idea how it's going to be done but she said lord be it unto me according to your word see we don't have to try to figure it out we don't have to try to process it god will do it all you got to do is trust him lean not to your own understanding but acknowledge him in all your ways and he shall direct your path i told you i'm not going to be long i got just a little bit left trying to get you to to understand trusting god with all your heart that's that's that's a commandment and and and and when you do it it uh it drives everything else away my old mother who didn't know nothing about this message but she was saved she was a true christian she couldn't read or write i saw more miracles in her life than i see around this message and she lived it she was also a peacemaker and she was one woman that had visions did y'all know women can have visions too yes i didn't know how she knew all my stuff but she did she really did i remember one time i had just finished doing something and she said junior she had such a sweet voice you know god don't like that i said what and then she told me i said mama you know i'll never do nothing like that lying in the face of god and didn't know it that's why i know i'm bright [Laughter] [Music] god didn't slay me [Laughter] amen didn't understand what that was until i had visions myself lord i'm not boasting i didn't mean i didn't even mean for that to come out but i tell you what i'll say i had several in my life and that's how i knew my wife was mine i was seeking a wife and right in the midst of a and it's like a television screen it was and there was my wife and another woman young lady that i thought i liked her the other lady i liked and when it came to sister ruby it just you know i didn't have that but you understand what i'm saying but when god gave me that vision and the one girl moved out the way and sister ruby stood there i said god that's your will i get up off my knees i'll do it now ask my wife i came off my knees went right to her i said come sister ruby i need to talk with you pulled her back in a private place in the church i said sister ruby will you marry me she said minister brooks don't you be playing with me that's what she said don't be playing with me i said i'm not playing with you i said let's go see the bishop we went in the bishop office talk to him you think facebook carry news when the people saw us coming out of that office and saying we were going to get married it traveled all over south carolina in a split second yes 40 something years now my wife and i been married hallelujah who could do that it was my wife who saw the corruption of the church and tried to tell me it was my wife that god gave eyes to see before i saw y'all understand what i'm saying it was predestinated i would not have made it this far without her i say that all the time my lord knows that the truth that is the truth because nobody could have loved me the way she does y'all y'all look at me because i'm preaching but you don't know what i used to be and all of the paranoia and all of the complexes i had that i did not know i [Music] had and she's still smiling [Music] huh she even looks younger so you look at these things and you say well brother what are you trying to say trust the lord my family say you crazy you don't even know this woman i didn't have to know her [Music] rebecca didn't know isaac did she but she knew it was god's choosing somebody help me here see that's what i'm saying when god is in it it's going to work out all right but you got to trust him that's why the prophet turned back around and he started walking in the storm then all of a sudden god see what god did god comes right around and says listen can i walk with you oh my god i'm looking one day i'm looking for god to talk to me like that there's a rapture coming there's a changing of the body hallelujah and i'm going to hear him say one day come on up [Music] hallelujah god is good and you and i must under that's you know people are so sad they're so sad you know what it you know it's like um johnny crow is what it was johnny crow didn't even know he was he was free hmm cut loose free and everything else he's still working walking in that circle walking in that circle designed to be free and you don't even know you're free that's what i'm talking about every one of these traps satan put you in the blood of jesus christ has already made you free [Music] but you got to claim your freedom you got to walk into your freedom you got to stop going around in these circles and go straight [Music] that's the truth if the devil can care for you walking in circles you know what he does he keeps reminding you of what you used to be [Applause] when the devil who is the liar come to you you need to tell him the truth tell him i'm the spirit of truth i've got the spirit of truth in me and that spirit of truth and i we are one and devil you are a liar hallelujah i know what god has done for me hallelujah don't you know what he's done for you we know what he's done for us i could have been anything i could have been anything i was around everything but there was something in me i call it determination that something in me refused to let my path become my future i couldn't care less what my family was doing but i knew i didn't want to be that you understand me and let me tell you something that's what drives me even now i see people all over the message falling and doing all kinds of stuff and i i said to the lord i says god something's wrong i said what i hear on the tape is not what i'm seeing y'all understand me i want to see what i hear the real thing the real life and it is happening because there are those of us who's not married to the system we're married to christ and because we're married to christ we see him on a daily basis he talks to me i trust this god talks to you he talks to me hallelujah god is good all right he has showed us or revealed it in every type and this is what i was trying to tell you when people when people when you start typing the old testament bringing in the new there's so many people will say well brother branham didn't say it like that but brother berlin said that he's just hitting the highlights and he's giving it over to these ministers who would catch it and bring it open it up more to us y'all understand me so as long as you stay within the word with that revelation it is the word is that the truth so you and i must understand all of those shadows and what would we do without ruth a lorabitis a idol worshiper whatever she was it was wicked and god had already told israel not to have anything to do with the moabites hallelujah kind of remind me when jesus told his disciples don't go to the gentiles hallelujah but there was still a day of purpose god had his mind in his mind a day for the gentiles and when he did he rose up powell and paul was a preacher to the gentiles thank god for paul can you imagine you think god didn't give uh uh um our sister of revelation didn't give root a revelation of what she was getting into she wasn't walking blindly god works on both ends [Music] you hear what i'm saying we didn't come to this message blindly this is a straight way it's a narrow way hallelujah it's a harder way is that right come on somebody holiness is holiness yes and what we must die to ourselves we don't need makeup we don't need high heels we don't need sexy clothes we don't need none of that stuff why because the beauty of god's salvation hallelujah god beautifies the meek with salvation you don't understand but when i was in the world i was a part here oh yes don't look with us like a shark on your face i was a partier yes sir every weekend everybody knew where to come because at my house everything was free yes sir i brought the booze i brought the food i opened the door i brought the music i bought everything and nobody was gonna out-dance me at my party that was hard for me when those holiness people said you can't dance no more i'm like what i can't dance no you know what i'm saying and that's the truth when they told me you got to cut your head cut my hair now i look i look and see how foolish i look i had all i have we call the afro y'all we have here now i look at people with that i'm like dump man oh god oh god that's what i look like you know because the devil's something else he'll make you look like a clown and tell you how beautiful you are it's the truth god is the devil the devil yes he will y'all know it's the truth not trying to peek at somebody i was there somewhere i ain't gonna say where we were because then if they listen they'll know they had eyelashes that's all i could see it's look like i'm trying to be funny but look like bugs had to attach themselves to the eyes and i know them things got to be heavy but the devil said you're so pretty it's the truth but that stuff is wrong god loves you the way you are [Applause] it's the truth i can't stand it when i see and i hope you ain't these dog lovers be putting these clothes on these dogs that's dog abuse but it's the truth now if they if they've been designed they can't take the wintertime or something like that i understand put a blanket over them or something but you're gonna have them with gloves on and caps on and coats on and you know what i'm saying it confuses the dog it does i'm sorry i'm so sorry but it does one time dogs and i don't be doing but i've seen this happen i'm walking just to be walking trying to get some exercise and the dog comes up in the truck and he looks at me like i feel so sorry for you you walking and i'm driving i don't mean to be funny but it's the truth they look at you like your health they're feeling sorry for you [Music] [Laughter] but it's the truth it's the truth oh lord have mercy and i still don't understand i know y'all dog lovers y'all love them y'all love them but i used to have five dogs and i never had to had to walk with them with a bag that's out that's out that's out that ain't happening and that's when i feel sorry for the human being i don't mean to hurt nobody's feeling but i just i can't that's me i'm not trying to let me stop let me stop i think i went a little bit too far but nevertheless let's move on by the grace of god hallelujah yes it's the truth [Music] it's the truth god help us jesus people are messed up [Music] it's the truth i went to this person's house and i don't mean no harm i'm on the road but i went to this person's house and i have trouble with cats cats love me though that's the truth he's fixing me breakfast at lunch it was lunch and that cat jumped up on the table god knows i'm like oh lord if the cat is on the table what else he can't do when he's on the table the food is on the table oh god help me so i had to eat in faith but i promised the lord i said i'll never come back to this house for so long as long as he got a cat i'm so sorry lord help me jesus it's nothing but the truth it's but the truth and it just show you how i value and listen they won't care for you like that a lot of times people don't care for people like that they love their dogs and their cats more than they love their people now that's the truth y'all ready to move on i am so i want you to understand that somewhere we don't lost something we lost something and and you know we've lost the love and affection for each other and everything and and and and it's not right we placed it with everything everything i was and that's the truth and i'm trying to tell us listen we've got to move farther than this as i was saying the other day about science it's okay to have a phone we all have them it's almost necessary but you know what we find ourselves doing and i was at the lake there a couple of summers ago and it was this couple in the canoe i know they got in that canoe fellowship with each other but they were not they both were on their iphones in the canoe now how romantic can you get but that's people do you know we had amen a bad accident there in lima because teenagers were driving instead of talking to each other they were all in the car but they were texting each other and by touching each other they they ran and hit i think if correct only one one one survived is that correct man yeah four of them was or something like that was in the car and they asked them the other ones died because they were we're losing and see you understand what i'm saying satan knows what he's doing and we can see how blessed how these things have really blessed us but if you're not careful it will capture you and it will cause you to give more time to that than you will to your husband your children and all the others and what that's going to do separate after a while the kids don't know how to communicate with you and you don't know how to communicate with them [Music] let me move on we need god that discerning that dedication that consecration giving more time like that brother walked up to me last night he said the lord said told me to tell you you know if you you uh basically said consecrate give more time to him and stuff like that i took it because it's true thank you brother for allowing god to use you because i know god spoke through you and i take it thank you because we need more consecration but he did not know that in my heart in my mind only god knew vindicating the what was spoken to me in my spirit to do he didn't know when i got home when i get home what my plans were but god through him spoke to vindicate that that was him and what did it do it's solidified see that's why what we need and that's what i'm trying to say oftentimes we're soul we're so caught up into the way well i don't know whether they're going to receive it or not and this and that it ain't your business if god is telling you to say something do something do it the church needs you almost done almost done so you can understand we are in a place right now that god wants us to be anointed inside and out [Music] when you're anointed inside you become dimensional you can see things other people can't i've see the hood before brother i've seen death i wasn't looking for it but i've seen it but when you become dimensional not only do you see that you also see supernatural things and it's not something you turn on it's just something that turns you on it's something that god gives you as a as a measure of encouragement or faith of i don't know but it helps you out but as long as we become these starchy old you know you know you you know in some churches you probably get a better reaction out of androids at least they respond and you know you think to yourself how can this be with the greatest message ever one thing i learned when i played football believe it or not i did i ran cross country too and i'm not talking about me but i'm talking about the coaches one thing they did that i appreciate they knew how to pull everything out of you if they saw a potential they knew what you can do even when you didn't know what you could do right god is the same way god knows how to pull things out of you you didn't even know what's in you all right i'm a close but let me say it like this you talk about desperation when desperation strikes you move in ways that you don't even know you're moving i remember the time and i don't know whether we ever talked about it here before but i'm gonna share this testimony before i close because i know anyway when my wife and i we had our kids were young adam scott how many we had her name is gracie but gracie uh began to have seizures and somehow it would seem like every time i would leave to go preach gracie would have a seizure and one day that old devil forgot i was home or something but anyway he came in my house with that seizure and i talked to him and i know it might sound stupid i said you got a nerve to come in my house and do my child like that yeah but let me tell you something with my wife she don't even remember desperation we we had we had her upstairs it was like a coming she grabbed the baby and she ran upstairs and i'm running behind me behind her give me the baby she turns around and she runs back downstairs she was so desperate she didn't know what to do now my daughter was having such a seizure all she was doing is wrote her eyes rolled back and she was forming out of her mouth and we prayed then god showed my wife something but we prayed and i command that devil to leave and then god showed her where the prophet of god ripped the shirt off of her brother told him and we did the same thing to my daughter she when she we ripped that thing off she had another one or something i forgot how that worked because it's been so long but my point is we ripped that thing off we put that thing in the fire we made a fire and don't you know that smoke started snaking we moved out of his way but it snaked you understand me that whatever the demon was and let me she never had another seizure since [Applause] they gave her some kind of medication that made her act like a zombie i said oh no we can't have this no no no no no no that's messing her mind up we're not gonna have listen people somewhere you gotta put your foot down you gotta get sick and tired of the devil right you gotta put your listen that's what i love that song he know who i am then if the devil knows who you are then you need to know who you are i don't i just just you know what i do not start fights but i learned not to run from them either it's the truth i got jumped when i was a boy by three guys and they beat me up really good scratched me all in the face stomped me kicked me whatever i didn't even know what's going on i was in la la land by the time i came to my senses because i didn't even understand it but i decreed myself i decreed i said lord i never i didn't know the lord i said i'll never let that happen again ever even when i was in high school this guy said let me cheat on your people i said no and he had shoulders like that little weights like that muscles everywhere and all i said i thought to myself you know i don't work all this time to get an a and you think i'm gonna let you cheat on my paper oh yeah i thought to myself you might win but you're gonna know you've been in a fight [Music] i don't even tell the devil that no you ain't going to win at all right but i thought to myself you might win but you go listen you know there's no fairness in fighting [Applause] no people say you ought to be fair no no no no if i got if i got some help on the side whether it be a stick or a brick [Applause] yeah i'm just being honest now i'm not like that now but there's a time you you wasn't going to do that to me you know about god's grace god has changed me my daddy had a temper on him and his temper was to kill he always fought to kill he never fought to hurt i experienced that mess that temper three times in my life scared me really bad and it wasn't for god i would have hurt the individual should be hurt or injured or something but god gave me grace and i think to myself you know god i know you've changed me because there was a that was something in me i didn't know was there but but god saw it and he needed to get it out and so i really cried out to the lord for a straight month to deliver me from that temper and he did and i'm trying to tell you people tonight or this morning in closing i just kind of jumped around a little bit but i wanted to get over to you about trust trust you got to trust him trust him right it ain't about your mama and your daddy trust him time is coming you won't have nobody else to trust you got to trust him all your trust you must put in him and i find out that every time that i don't acknowledge him i get in trouble you know a physical situation i'm dealing with right now because i didn't inquire of the lord have you ever gone to the doctor and they make things worse and better that's what i'm talking about now you gotta you gotta trust god anyhow you see what i'm saying don't worry it ain't nothing contagious but it's something i know god has already healed me from [Music] and so i'm trusting the lord and everything and people of god we've had such a wonderful time but before we close i want to ask if there's anybody who desired prayer i know we prayed already but if that's okay that's fine too may i say one more song before the past to come okay so i'll send it i'll give you a concert here i'm kind of home [Music] see [Music] for a country to which i've named there been before [Music] no sad goodbyes there will be spoken for time won't matter anymore [Music] let's stand and sing that together i am longing for and someday on thee i'll stay [Applause] [Music] shall be eater [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] sweet [Music] across that hallelujah that's where my faith [Applause] [Music] [Applause] there's just a few more days to labor and soon we'll take that [Music] hey [Music] someday [Applause] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] thank you [Music] sing it one more time and someday [Music] they're my home shall be eternal you love [Music] let's give the lord praise for what we have heard today oh jesus thank you thank you lord thank you for your word thank you for your encouragement oh god we trust you lord give us grace and strength to trust you more hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hasn't he been good to us so so so good do you really want the young people to sing that again all right yes we can make the time brother brooks is serious about having the young people to come and sing that song again so if you want to be seated for a moment you can and while they're coming while all of you are coming and getting ready we'll just say to all of our visitors we are so thankful that you have been with us we want to mention brent and brother brent and sister trish from tucson and that little angel that they have with them that god blessed them with he really performed a miracle and we're so thankful and he is a living doll and they took brother brent works hard sister trish works they had vacation and they split it so that they could spend some of that time with us in these meetings and we feel honored and we appreciate it so much thank you all for coming and brother dwayne jackson and uh sister heather too you know how we got to know each other as i just started picking on her didn't really know her but you know uh this is a wonderful couple and their two children that we love and we're so blessed wasn't a song something this morning wasn't that good uh brother do you you have an answer for the question that i ask are we good to go all right brother dwayne jackson is going to be preaching for us the weekend of [Music] 29th what is the friday night okay so 30th and 31st the weekend of the

come to the close of one meeting we have something wonderful to look forward to i appreciate their sacrifice for being here i want to say one more time brother miller brother truman they they came a little bit early uh the miller family from missouri we are so thankful they're our family but we know it's a sacrifice sister phoebe she came early from pennsylvania and we're so happy that she's been with us and we're always happy to see her and we're double happy to see her when she comes walking in with lebanon baloney now we're really glad to see her and i'm just so thankful and then all of our brothers and sisters from indiana you have been a real asset to this meeting and i mean that we appreciate every one of you being here [Applause] we didn't know that they would brother elam wasn't even sure at one point if he would be able to come and um you know the the talk about how many would be here and so forth and uh if anybody thought anything about there being so many of them here that was really my fault because i kept saying bring them on bring more is that all you got can you can you bring some more with you and what a blessing it has been to all of us and uh sister ruby you know i i tell you that's an outstanding story brother brooks that's that's real that that is rubber meets the road now i don't know what i'm going to do if i'm sitting in my office one day and here comes a boy and a girl a young brother and young sister that i didn't even know knew each other had even an interest and they walk in and say that's going to be that's going to be something but the bishop must have been okay with it was it no oh [Laughter] you know it has to be a love story i mean oh he'd already chosen somebody for you i see but god had a different idea didn't he he had a different plan now the only way that it'll be worth the time that we take although it's lovely to listen to the only way it'll be worth the time is if we worship if we praise god while they're singing and that's what we really really really want to do is praise god i'm not i don't i don't is there anything else i need to say brother greeley um there will be no service here tuesday night not because we don't want to be with the lord we're going to be with him ever all week long but uh we all need just a little bit of a break just a little sleep would be so nice we will be back here next sunday morning and there will be all kinds of different things going on the young people are will be together and etc cetera when we when the young people have sung and we're finished and we have finished everything off with praise then we will dismiss the service maybe we'll just do that maybe we'll just even pray now and then you're free to go out to have some fellowship with one another but just remember that some of the visitors have to leave today and drive a long way north carolina some are going up to atlanta to the airport some are going all the way to indiana and so the fastest that we could get the quickest that we could get our lunch back and get it on the table the more time for fellowship they could leave earlier and and get on the road and we wouldn't be i don't want us to be the reason why anyone has been detained so can we do that let's go home get what we need unless you maybe brought some let's get back as quick as we can fill the tables up let's have wonderful food and fellowship today in the name of the lord is that all right with you all right lord jesus our hearts are so full we don't have all our voices left and maybe a little physical tiredness but we are so full of your blessing your glory your anointing your word has fed us and sustained us we thank you one more time for sending brother isaiah brooks and sister ruby to us for their ministry to us and their love for us and his desire to be used in a mighty way and he indeed was and we give the glory to god we thank you for every visitor we thank you lord for the desire that you placed in their hearts to be here and we thank you for the value that they have added to the service lord i thank you for those who worship at the new hope revival ministries our home folks who have labored so hard made sacrifices to enhance these services to cook to serve lord i ask that you bless them strengthen them sustain them in every way lord we look ahead to more wonderful times of fellowship around your word and we give thanks to you for all that you have done we just say to god be all the glory and the honor and praise we ask these blessings that you would be over those who travel that the angels of the lord will line the highways and the airways as the saints of god go home today and tomorrow may they arrive safely and in your tender care in a higher place than they were when they left home to come and we'll give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the lovely and exalted name of our lord jesus christ we pray amen hallelujah i reclaim my victory [Music] [Music] that i am [Music] victory [Applause] [Music] now the devil has told me that i am unworthy i'm undeserving and i'll never reach that land but the word of god said it's my inheritance the blood is applied and the devil's a liar he knows just who i am [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] that i'll never break through but the word of god [Music] told me that i am am [Music] [Applause] and i'll never reach that land but the word of god said it's my inheritance the blood is a liar he knows just who i am [Music] i am [Music] victory [Music] but the word of god says he'll find my battles he's more than able to satan let me tell you i am i am [Music] [Applause] victory [Music] [Music] reclaim my victory [Music] i am [Music] [Music] he knows just who i am i am [Music] [Applause] [Music] i [Music] so satan let me tell you more [Music] i am [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] he'll never stand cause i am i am an overcomer [Music] he'll never stand cause i am i am [Music] [Music] he'll never [Applause] victory [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] grace you are oh [Music] hallelujah [Music] i'm meaning to say you are dismissed in the name of the lord but i felt one of those joy bubbles you are dismissed to go in the name of the lord but take the joy of god with you amen whatever jesus says you are you know some of us came from holiness and pentecost and apostolic church and we trusted the men of god that were called to lead us we trusted them and they make a joke about it sometime but if they if they felt like they had a word from the lord for us we believed it even if we hadn't seen it yet if somebody said i really feel like i need to pray for your heart trouble and we didn't have heart trouble we received prayer anyway because we had confidence and they used to make a statement they say if the man of god says i am i am that's just where we come from that's just what we what we were taught and how we moved well let me tell you something you are what jesus says you are you are you can trust him you may not feel like you are now you may not see it operating in your life now but now he says now he says i am a conqueror i am an overcomer hallelujah i am healed i am made whole by the blood of the lamb and there is power in speaking and decreeing these things over our life the world calls them positive affirmations but you can't get any more positive than god's word and when you decree decree that and declare that and it's it's really prophecy you're prophesying that over your life by the holy ghost and then it's god's business to make you manifest that you're a conqueror it's god's business to bring that to pass if you decree it and declare it in faith now i behaved i've i've tried my best to behave this week but i had to get that out you are dismissed a goal for about the tenth time but as you go out would you clap your hands for this youth group one more time they are they get they get very excited about volleyball most of them volleyball sometimes i can't even come and watch them there's only certain sundays i can come if it's a nervous sunday if i've gone home nervous i can't even come watch them play because they get quite competitive and that takes me back to how it was preached to us emulations they used to call it you know striving and so forth makes me nervous but they must have this idea that i'm going to do if i'm going to do it i'm going to do the best i can and i'm going to be the best i can and they're passionate about that and we allow them to do that but i want you to know i'm so thankful for this passion they're worshipers they're worshipers and they have a passion to follow jesus christ don't you you look a little weary and tired i love you every one of you god bless you you're dismissed to go today in jesus name [Music] [Music] [Music] you
