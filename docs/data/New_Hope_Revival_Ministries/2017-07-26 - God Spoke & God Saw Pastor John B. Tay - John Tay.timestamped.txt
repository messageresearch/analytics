[0:02] praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steven Shelly
[0:05] and I have the incredible blessing today
[0:07] of sitting here with a dear precious
[0:10] friend of mine Pastor John B Tay from GH
[0:14] West Africa specifically from the city
[0:17] of TMA TMA Ghana West Africa pastor Tay
[0:22] and I have been friends for many years
[0:24] now and he has hosted me many times in
[0:28] his beautiful Church Bible Believers
[0:31] Fellowship in TMA and in some of the
[0:33] sister churches uh across the beautiful
[0:36] country of Ghana and it has been a real
[0:39] blessing a real privilege to have
[0:41] fellowship and relationship with those
[0:44] precious people there and we have been
[0:46] so incredibly blessed this weekend to
[0:49] have Pastor Tay preaching for us and the
[0:52] fellowship has been so sweet and the
[0:55] word of God has been so rich and we
[0:58] wanted to take this opport opportunity
[1:00] to uh let Pastor ta share with us a few
[1:04] of the thoughts what whatever really the
[1:06] Lord puts on his heart but we were so
[1:09] blessed in in our church on Sunday
[1:11] because we've been teaching and
[1:13] preaching on thoughts and the power of
[1:17] our thoughts and how we need to think
[1:19] right and uh on Sunday evening God used
[1:23] Pastor Tay to take it to the next level
[1:25] because words are thoughts expressed and
[1:28] he began to speak speak to us about
[1:31] words and about speaking and seeing and
[1:34] it it was just absolutely tremendous so
[1:38] uh we're just honored to have you today
[1:40] with us Pastor Taye can you talk to us a
[1:43] little bit about you started yesterday
[1:45] in Genesis it doesn't matter to me where
[1:47] you start but I was just so blessed
[1:50] about how you started in Genesis talking
[1:52] about uh the first words that God spoke
[1:56] and then what followed that would you
[1:58] share just a little bit of that with the
[1:59] folks who are watching this broadcast
[2:02] today Pastor sherley the Book of Genesis
[2:04] is the G story yeah every reasing we
[2:09] have today they have their beginning
[2:11] from
[2:13] Genesis so in Genesis we see God and we
[2:20] are told he is a
[2:22] spirit when you come to the New
[2:25] Testament when God let me put it this
[2:28] way born
[2:31] you or gives birth to you right you take
[2:35] his
[2:37] nature because every seed we are told in
[2:41] Genesis should bring forth of its own
[2:44] kind that's right so when you are born
[2:46] of God you take his divine
[2:51] nature you are like a
[2:54] god do you know crab do you know crab
[2:57] yes crab will never bring forth fish M
[3:01] no M so when God bets you you must be
[3:08] like God like God and we read if the
[3:12] spirit of
[3:14] God of
[3:16] Genesis dwells in you that's where you
[3:19] started yes that verse then we go to
[3:23] Genesis we see the spirit of that God in
[3:28] us today
[3:31] yes problem huge problem intimidating
[3:35] problem we see in Genesis 1 Darkness
[3:39] right void mhm without
[3:44] form what was the
[3:46] reaction of
[3:49] God that should be our reaction when we
[3:52] are also facing similar intimidating
[3:56] situations yes sir and I made it like
[4:00] that was the principle of first mission
[4:04] mhm there are certain principles in the
[4:07] in the Bible when it was first done
[4:11] right so we see God
[4:14] here
[4:16] speaking let there be light mhm he
[4:21] wasn't complaining or meming about the
[4:23] [Music]
[4:25] situation so that is the god that we we
[4:29] claim today is in US amen so that when
[4:34] we are faced with similar problem which
[4:36] we will be faced with and that God is in
[4:41] us when we open our mouth we must speak
[4:46] like he would have done or have spoken
[4:50] if he were confronted at that time with
[4:53] similar situation that's powerful yes
[4:57] powerful yes and then what
[5:00] he said he spoke he spoke and God said
[5:04] and God said if you watch the whole of
[5:08] Genesis and God
[5:13] said and God saw oh and it was good is
[5:21] running throughout the whole period of
[5:24] creation a
[5:26] theme God
[5:28] said God
[5:30] saw and it was good
[5:33] amen so the same God comes over here to
[5:37] indwell us MH and he has told us in his
[5:42] word that if you and me will
[5:47] say not even pray say to this mountain
[5:51] be thou removed and we don't doubt and
[5:55] God doesn't doubt no sir the spirit of
[5:57] God in us has no place for doubt amen
[6:01] amen no doubt so he
[6:04] said you will
[6:07] have what you you say wow so the thing
[6:14] is you should not say what you have
[6:20] because what you
[6:22] have is Darkness right bad circumstances
[6:27] yes disappointments m yes sir and what
[6:31] have you
[6:32] mhm but that God in us especially this
[6:37] day we should be
[6:40] displaying his character amen amen so
[6:46] that I think that was what we trying
[6:48] pass on to the people love I love that
[6:50] he spoke it and then he saw it so he saw
[6:54] what he spoke so you're saying that if
[6:56] the same spirit of God that was present
[6:59] in Genesis 1 if that same spirit is in
[7:02] us we have to be careful what we say
[7:05] exactly because what we speak we're
[7:07] going to see so I think you're teaching
[7:10] us that if we're speaking about the
[7:12] darkness or speaking about the bad
[7:14] circumstances all the time complaining
[7:16] or murmuring as you preached then that's
[7:19] what we're going to continue to see yes
[7:21] so we need to start speaking what we
[7:23] desire to see what God has promised us
[7:26] in his word exactly amen that is such a
[7:29] powerful truth and I love that so much
[7:32] in fact you you were telling us clearly
[7:35] that we should say what instead of
[7:38] saying what we have we should have what
[7:40] we say in whatever
[7:43] situation you will find
[7:45] yourself ask yourself if God were to be
[7:51] here what will he do or what will he
[7:56] say do that and do that wow wow that's
[8:00] big but that's really the daily
[8:02] Christian Life that's what we've been
[8:04] called to do that's the life we have
[8:06] been called to live well we sure do
[8:08] appreciate that there's there's one
[8:10] other thing that I want us to put in
[8:12] this little segment and that is you had
[8:14] us to write up on the board the word
[8:18] impossible yes and then you had them to
[8:21] separate that word impossible and on the
[8:24] one side we had I am and on the other
[8:27] side we had possible just speak about
[8:29] that at a moment yes as is in the
[8:33] gospels recorded by
[8:35] Luke with
[8:38] God nothing shall be impossible amen so
[8:44] God is not in the category of
[8:49] impossible so I cannot be in the
[8:51] impossible
[8:54] category and the English language this
[8:56] is semantic I don't know other languages
[8:59] MH looking at the word
[9:03] impossible just doing a separation mhm
[9:06] then you have I am possible and that is
[9:10] in line with the word of God I am
[9:13] possible I am possible I believe it I am
[9:17] possible Hall nothing is impossible with
[9:21] me now so it is possible for me to be
[9:25] everything that God says that I am that
[9:28] is where
[9:29] God wants us to be Genesis before
[9:35] Genesis 3 we were on the platform of
[9:38] dominion right be fruitful yes multiply
[9:43] yes have dominion MH and then the fall
[9:46] came then at Calvary Jesus came down and
[9:51] took us up and rais us up Hallelujah
[9:55] back to the position we were amen before
[9:58] the fall of ad amen so right now we are
[10:02] in the position of
[10:04] multiplication fruitfulness amen subdue
[10:08] and in the book of Hebrews he made us a
[10:11] little lower than the Angels yes but he
[10:14] has Crown us with Glory and Honor there
[10:18] you are wow so we are back on the
[10:21] platform of dominion amen today that
[10:25] when you
[10:26] speak God backs you if it is his word so
[10:31] that was another one of your points if
[10:33] we walk in that Dominion Authority that
[10:36] was promised to us in the beginning then
[10:38] you told us the bride is
[10:41] Unstoppable Unstoppable Jesus prophesy
[10:45] about it the Gates of Hell shall not
[10:52] Prevail against you they will fight
[10:55] against you but they will not prevail
[10:59] against you Jeremiah said the same thing
[11:01] amen so we are unstoppable Unstoppable
[11:04] Unstoppable they could not stop the
[11:06] bride when the bride was launched from
[11:09] the book of Acts chapter 2 yes sir they
[11:11] brought in killing red horse
[11:15] rider but it could not work no they
[11:19] brought in the black horse rider we have
[11:23] doctrinal perversion yes Dark Ages came
[11:30] but the bride was moving on she kept
[11:32] marching forward kept marching and now
[11:34] we have reached the climax yes yes sir
[11:37] and this end time bride has been
[11:40] predestinated not to fail amen amen
[11:44] because in the mind of God of which we
[11:48] also have the mind of Christ yes sir
[11:51] when God looks at his church he sees a
[11:55] glorious church and you are the building
[11:58] of God
[11:59] you are the Church of God he is Pastor
[12:02] sh
[12:03] glorious without blemish without sport
[12:07] Hallelujah and he allowed John to see
[12:10] you right in the island of pmos
[12:13] Amen his wife has made herself ready so
[12:19] in the mind of God the Bride of Jesus Oh
[12:22] My is glorious Hallelujah even if you
[12:25] want me to go further apart from predes
[12:29] ated us right now he has already
[12:33] glorified Us in his mind amen so what
[12:36] can stop me amen nothing like Paul said
[12:40] amen nothing as for the grave and death
[12:43] they are just Messengers when I am tired
[12:46] and I want to sleep then God sends death
[12:49] to come and carry me
[12:50] to it's just a doorway to the other side
[12:53] other side to the real the real yes so
[12:56] death is just a vehicle that to come and
[12:59] take my servant for him to come and rest
[13:02] that is so encouraging Pastor thank you
[13:03] so much I hope you hear what the pastor
[13:06] is telling us today you if you are a
[13:09] part of the Bride of Jesus Christ you
[13:11] are
[13:13] unstoppable amen and the key is to come
[13:16] into agreement with God's word amen amen
[13:19] and don't just talk about what you see
[13:22] but speak what God's word says and
[13:25] expect to see what you speak amen that
[13:28] is so powerful so we will leave you with
[13:31] those powerful words we just ask that
[13:33] the Lord will seal them into your heart
[13:35] by the power of the Holy Spirit and that
[13:38] you will be all that God has called you
[13:40] to be in this day thank you so much
[13:42] Pastor Tay I appreciate it very much I'm
[13:45] encouraged thank you God bless you bless
