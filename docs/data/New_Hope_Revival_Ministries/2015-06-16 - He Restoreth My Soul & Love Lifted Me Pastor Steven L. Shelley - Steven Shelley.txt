TRANSCRIPT
========================================
But the Lord knows I can't live on the mountain. Not always. And so he picked out a valley for me. That's when he leads me beside still waters. Sing it with me. Somewhere in the valley below. And then he draws me aside to be tested and tried. But in the valley he restoreth my soul. And then he leads me beside still waters. [Music] Somewhere in the valley below, Jesus draws me aside to be tested, tested and tried. But it's in that valley. He restoreth my soul. Maybe you've been here. It's dark as a dungeon and the sun som shines. And when I'm there, I question, Lord, why must this be? Oh, but then he tells me there is strength through your sorrow. And there's victory in trials for me. And I want to thank you, Lord. Oh, he leads me beside still waters. [Music] And it's somewhere in the valley below. But that's when he draws me aside to be tested and tried. God in the valley, he restoreth my soul. First verse again. When I'm low in spirit, that's when I cry, Lord, lift me up. I really want to go higher with thee. [Music] But the Lord knows that I can't always live on a mountain. [Music] So he picks out he picks it out a valley for me. As long as the Lord's picking it, I'll be all right. And he leads me beside still waters. And it's somewhere in the valley below. And that's when he draws me aside to be tested and tried. But in the valley he restoreth my soul. Sing that line with me. Jesus draws me aside to be tested and tried. But it's in the valley. He restoreth my soul. I was sinking deep in sin. Far from the peaceful shore. Sing it just like that. Wrong tempo. very deeply stained within, sinking to rise, sinking to rise no more. But the master I hear you of the sea heard my despairing cry from the waters and from the waters lifted me now safe am I. Now pick it up and let's sing. It was love lifted me. Love lifted me when nothing else could help. His love lifted me. Oh, love lifted me. Love lifted me when nothing else could help. When nothing else could help. Love lifted me. One more time. Help me. Love lifted me. Where would you be without his love? Love lifted me when nothing else when nothing else could help. His love lifted me. Oh love lifted me. [Music] Love lifted me. Thank you, Lord. When nothing else could have love [Applause] lifted me. If you're thankful for love, give the Lord Jesus. [Applause]
