TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right twiced in you the hope award [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley from New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming to you today in partnership with brother Eric Erickson and all the fine folks at the gospel channel I don't know about you but I'm very thankful to God for the gospel channel and the work that they're doing all across Europe UK Scandinavia Iceland and I'm sure that most of you know that you can go online and visit the website and stream three different feeds from the gospel Channel the icelandic the Scandinavian and the European and you can stream that just about in every nation of the world and so I'm thankful for what God is doing I've been going back and forth to Iceland for many years now and I'm very impressed with the sincerity and the humility brother Ericsson and his dedication and if you've never heard the story of the gospel channel you need to do that there's a book and the testimony of the gospel channel is shared in that book and you'll see that God has chosen the little island of Iceland to play a very important role in the endtime and I'm blessed because we get to be a part of that I'm here today again with our good friend evangelist brother Gerald Hicks and he was with us some time back and shared his testimony and then we just recently did a program with him where he was so anointed with hope he so encouraged us and I know that you were encouraged let me remind you that you can reach out to the ministry here with your prayer request there's a prayer line number that you can call the email address is given if you if you've missed a program and you'd like to go back and catch up you can do that searching for our channel on YouTube and our website revival dot o-r-g is full of resources and information that I know will be a blessing to you and what I'm going to do today is I'm here as a host but I'm going to just let Brother Hicks speak to the camera because we know that on the other side of this camera there are people who love the Lord and who are hungry who have needs who need to be encouraged we know that there are people who don't yet know the Lord and I want you to be able to experience the ministry that God has given our brother he shared with us the last time we were together here that after hearing him preach a young man came up and he had his own ideas about what kind of a background brother Hicks must surely have to be able to have the ministry the foundation of truth that he has today he said you must have come from a very fine family and great Christian parents raising you in the church etc etc and brother Hicks let him know nothing could be farther from the truth but that's what makes this testimony and his life and ministry such a blessing is to know that there were many many odds against him but God was for him God had a purpose God had a plan before he was ever born and I want you to know it's not just that way for brother Gerald Hicks God has a plan for your life as well and he's waiting on you to surrender to him brother Hicks was preaching to us the other night about the difference between having a head experienced head knowledge and having heart knowledge I used to have a dear friend who would be preaching on that and he would say when it drops from your head to your heart to your hands when that knowledge that you've got in your head becomes a revelation in your heart then you start living it out with your hands and walking it out with your feet nothing could be any more true than those words so I'm just going to invite you brother Hicks to just take off and when I when I need to slow you down to pray we'll do that but until then would you take your liberty I feel honored to have you Pastor Shelly what an honor today to be with you what an honor to be able to share the word of the Lord today I was thinking about the passage of Scripture that's found in Matthew chapter 16 beginning with verse 13 when Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the Son of Man am when he asked this - this question the disciples were so quick and ready to respond they immediately began to respond some say that thou art John the Baptist and some Elias others Jeremias or one of the prophets they quickly responded to the Lord Jesus because everywhere they went somebody was talking about who they thought he was and so they quickly responded some say you're John the Baptist some say you're Elijah some say you're Jeremiah others say you're one of the prophets but then he looked at these twelve men that he had hand-picked from every social and political plane in life and he asked them but whom say ye that I am at this moment the same twelve disciples who just moments before or so quick and so ready to respond and tell him yes sir who others say he is now they were completely speechless a few moments ago they could tell Jesus who the scribe who the Jew who the Pharisee who the bond who the free who the rich of the poor the young the old the male or the female thought he was and now that Jesus looks at them and asked them this very personal pointed question yes but whom say ye that I am all of a sudden these twelve disciples are completely speechless they're silent they don't really know exactly what to say they don't really know exactly how to respond but I can imagine that the wheels of their mind must be turning at this moment and each of them must be wondering in his own mind just exactly who is he hmm they had watched him open the eyes of the blind that watched him unstopped the ears of the Deaf they had watched him turn water into wine at a wedding feast in Cana of Galilee they had watched him feed multitudes with just a few loaves and fish they had stood by the roadside and witnessed as he raised the dead to life again and now they are trying to contemplate in their own mind just exactly who is he and all of a sudden it was Simon Peter who opened his mouth and declared with great boldness according to verse 16 thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God thou art the anointed one right a man thou art the Christ the Anointed One the Son of the Living God and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say also unto thee that thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it now will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven yes and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven immediately when Simon Peter declared thou art the Christ the Anointed One the son of the Living God Jesus declared blessed art thou simon Jonah Amen I think today that the real way for you and I and many many others to become blessed is to find out who Jesus Christ really is there are multitudes of people who are searching in every direction they are going up and down back in here with to and fro all throughout the earth and they are searching they're looking why because there's something deep inside that truly longs to be blessed and according to the Word of God according to this passage that blessing begins in your life and mind when we discover who Jesus Christ really is that he is the Anointed One the Son of the Living God see it's at this moment that the scales of spiritual blindness fell from the eyes of Simon Peter and he boldly declared without fear without embarrassment without trepidation thou art the crime right yes sir and Jesus immediately lets Simon Peter know that flesh and blood has not revealed this unto thee if you know who Jesus is today flesh and blood does not reveal to you who Jesus Christ truly is if you know him to be the Christ the Anointed One the Son of the Living God it's not flesh and blood that reveals that unto you but it is the mercy of God it is the grace of God that allows the scales of spiritual blindness to fall from our eyes and gives us a divine understanding that he's more than just a baby that was born in a manger wrapped in swaddling clothes that he's more than just Mary's little boy he's more than Joseph's son he's more than a lowly Galilee anomaly he's more than just the son of a carpenter in Nazareth but that he is indeed without a factor the son of the Living God yes sir amen and so it is that flesh and blood does not reveal this it has to be revealed to us and by the spirit and Jesus said when you receive this understanding when you receive this revelation I'm going to give you keys to the kingdom mama and whatever you bind on earth is going to be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth is going to be loosed in heaven how very important it is for you and I to discover for ourselves who Jesus Christ really is you know it's it's amazing to me that there are tens of thousands of people who attend church on a weekly basis and they do not know who Jesus Christ is right really is my it astounds me it staggers my mind at the vast multitude of people in our world today who truly does not have a clue in this world who Jesus Christ really is they do have some head knowledge they've read some scripture and they've listened to some sermons and they've looked through some books and they've done some research over the internet and all of that's good and all of that has its place but today as individuals of if we are going to leave a lasting impression on the generation in which we live if we are going to change the world in which we're a part of we must have much much more than just head knowledge of what we truly need is some heart knowledge head knowledge may tell me a little about him but when I get heart knowledge I'm gonna be fully introduced to him that's right and so it is that Jesus setup on this rock upon this divine revelation yes sir what was the revelation the revelation was thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God Jesus setup only this revelation I am going to build my church salut yeah hallelujah this church that you and I are part of this body that we are members of has been built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ it has been built on the revelation of the mighty God in Christ amen hallelujah and I am so thankful today that I have a I have a real understanding not but because of flesh and not because lessor it's not because of intelligence not because of intellect but I have a divine understanding because he has decided to allow his mercy to come into my life but in thinking about head knowledge verses heart knowledge I remember a story that I heard quite a number of years ago and it so impacted me when I heard it and I have remembered it all these years it was about a young man that at the age of 18 years old living in what you and I would call the Bible Belt on the eastern seaboard in the United States of America a young man at 18 years old who had never heard the name Jesus a young man at 18 years old that had never seen the inside or the outside of a church a young man at 18 years old that had never heard a gospel song imagine pastor Shelley you and I probably cannot even remember how old we were when we heard our first gospel song we were so young we probably cannot even remember the first time we heard the name Jesus because we were so young we probably cannot even remember our first trips to the house of God because we've been attending church virtually all of our life and sometimes if we're not careful we tend to take that for granted it's so true and when we tend to take it for granted we lose yes our appreciation for it is the truth but oh God helped me to dance Lord not to ever lose my love and my appreciation for the house of God and for the things of God and for the work of the ministry especially but this young man had never heard the name Jesus the story has it that his father was not an atheist he did believe in a Supreme Being somewhere but he was a professing agnostic he would tell people that he absolutely hated God that he hated the name Jesus I cannot even imagine someone hating the name Jesus I think about how wonderful that name yes I think about how sweet and how life-changing that name is and I cannot even imagine that somebody could hate the name Jesus but this man would literally declare two people that he hated the main Jesus and when his son was born he made a vow that he would raise that son to never hear the name Jesus he made a vow that with everything that was in him if at all possible he would keep that young man away from God and away from the house of God and for 18 years he was successful at doing that 18 years that young man lived in a free country that is filled with the gospel from seaboard to seaboard and had never heard the name Jesus yes and now at 18 years old his father goes to the west coast and while his father is gone this young man comes in contact with a new employ that is working around the home as a gardener and the young man the first day he saw this gardener he wasn't all that fascinated at first but the longer he watched the gardener the more fascinated he became he really couldn't explain it he couldn't put his finger on it but there was just something about this gardener the more he watched him the more intrigued he was to watch him and he noticed that every once in a while the gardener would stop taking his hand and wipe the sweat from his brow and he would take his hand and wave like he was waving at somebody but the young man thought in his mind who in the world could he be waving at the more he watched the gardener the closer he got to the house he noticed that not only would he take his hand and wipe the sweat from his brow not only would he look up and wave like it was waving at somebody but he even watched it it seemed like his lips were moving like he was talking to somebody but who in the world could he be talking to it wasn't very long the gardener happened to notice that the young man was watching him push the lawn mower back and forth back and forth and so he finally decided to stop walked over to where the young man was looking through the glass door motion for the young man to open the door and when the young man pulled the door open just a little darkness that excuse me young man may I have five minutes of your time the young man looked at the gardener and said sir why on earth would you want five minutes of my time the gardener said I would like to tell you the greatest story that's ever been told I am I the young man thought for a moment I have been educated by the finest teachers professors and scholars in all of the world at a very very great expense to my father and you appear to be just a normal average ordinary individual how in the world could you possibly tell me the greatest story that's ever been told by man the gardener looked at the young man and said I would like to tell you the story of Jesus hi at this moment there were question marks in the eyes of the young man he looked into the face of the gardener and he said who in the world is Jesus I've never heard that name before the gardener said would you give me just five minutes and let me tell you the story of Jesus the young man opened the door invited the gardener in it would not be five minutes but it would be somewhere like five hours I really don't know where the gardener started I really don't know where he ended up but I do know that at his conclusion that young boy 18 years old who had never heard the name Jesus found himself down on his knees with trembling hands raised in the air with hot tears streaming down his face and as he began to call on the name of Jesus Christ for the very first time heaven came down and glory filled his soul and that young man began to speak in a heavenly language as the spirit in him the utterance and little did he know at that moment that his life would be changed for time and eternity they tell me that for the next several days that young boy spent the most part of every day down on his knees with trembling hands in the air with hot tears streaming down his face calling on the name of Jesus and speaking in a heavenly language as the Spirit of God gave him the other area the day his father finally arrived back at home from the west coast he was anxious to see his son and so he quickly inquired about where his son was at and started to make his way to the room where his son was at and when he climbed the stairs and started down the hallway about halfway down the hallway he could hear the muffled echo of his son's voice coming from behind the door and as he drew close to the door he began to realize that there was an uncertain sound coming from behind the door when he finally opened the door to his shock and great surprise he found his son down on knees that were bent with trembling hands up in the air with hot tears streaming down his face calling the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that father was so angry that he ran across the room he jerked that son up off of his bended knees I pushed him up against the wall and began to shake him violently all the while he shouted over and over at the top of his voice what's happened to you what's happened to you who has done this to you when that young boy was finally able to respond he looked at his daddy and said I know Jesus and I have been filled with the Holy Ghost that father was so angry he left the room and slammed the door behind him in just a little while he would find himself in his office on the telephone in separate conversations with two of the most noted and talented brain surgeons in all of the world and in different conversations he asked those surgeons to perform a very delicate operation on his son what he literally wanted those surgeons to do was he wanted them to perform a frontal lobotomy where they would go in above his left eye in a very delicate procedure and erase or remove his memory bank in a very delicate procedure they could erase everything that's ever been stored in a person's memory the two surgeons explained to the father the seriousness of this procedure and said don't you understand that everything that your son has ever learned everything that he's ever stored in his memory will has to be learned all over again that father said it will be worth it if you can get Jesus and the Holy Ghost out of his mind my-my-my so against the young boys wheel they took that boy to another country and they performed this operation and that surgeons guaranteed the father that it was absolutely medically impossible for that young boy to remember anything and they tell me that for nearly two weeks after the operation that young boy sat in a hospital bed in a room with a blank stare on his face every waking moment they said there was absolutely no physical no verbal response of any kind for two weeks and finally one day they walked in and said that eighteen year old boy was sitting up in the hospital bed holding up two fingers and they did not understand that and said they would go over and try to put his hand down and he would raise it right back up they try to put his hand down and he would raise it right back up and after doing that for several days they walked in one day and they were going to do a routine examination and before they started their routine examination this young boy 18 years old who has not spoken a word in over two weeks since the operation in a very slurred voice like a child just learning how to speak that 18 year old boy said I know Jesus and I've been filled with the Holy Ghost that father could not believe this he hated the name Jesus in such a way that he would take that young man and he would put him in a padded cell in a straitjacket and they would perform one horrible procedure after another on this young man and doctors and specialists said he should he should be ignorant he should be a vegetable he should never be able to function normally in society he shouldn't be able to talk he shouldn't be able to read he shouldn't be able to remember or comprehend anything however after everything they put that young boy through if he could not speak if he had no voice to speak with he could pick up a crayon like a child and walk over and write on the side of the wall I know Jesus and I've been filled with the Holy Ghost somebody said well exactly what happened what happened is this the young boy did not have hit knowledge but the young boy had heart knowledge of that see when we have hip knowledge yes sir sometimes people can erase it for Laurier's but if we ever get heart knowledge nobody will ever be able to erase it and the table of the heart no wonder David said I hid the word and we're in the heart not on the tables of my minds but he said I hid the word in my heart that I might not sin against thee amen David understood I have to have the Word of God yes sir not just in my mind not just in my memory but I need to write it down on the tables of my heart why is that because the Bible said from the abundance of what the heart the mouth is going to speak hallelujah the mouth does not speak what is in the mind the mouth speaks what's in the heart hallelujah that is why it is so very important for us to get the gospel of the message of the Lord Jesus Christ the words of eternal life not just in our mind not just in our memory not just in our head but all today we need to get the Word of God written on the tables of our heart hallelujah why because when we get it written down it is on the tables of our heart health there is nothing and there is no body that will ever be able to erase it hallelujah if it's only written they own up on the tables of the mind the right amount of temptation right the right amount of glitter the right amount of glamour the right amount of fortune or fame the right amount of pain or trouble or difficulty may cause you to forget about it I remember as a young man they told me when I first profess Christ as my Lord and Savior my very dearest friends told me you'll outgrow that oh my you'll get tired of that you'll get bored with that some of my dearest friends told me I tried that once just like you and it'll get old but did you know pastor Shelly a three and a half decades 35 years later I love him more today than I've ever loved him and man the experience that I have is more real and it is more alive in my heart and in my spirit and in my life today than it's ever being why but I did not just get an experience in my hell that's right but thank God more importantly I got an experience in my heart hallelujah yes and that's exactly what God wants today for every individual who's hearing our voice who's watching this broadcast God wants you to have lawyers just ahead knowledge he wants you to have more than just an understanding in your intelligence but God wants you to have a divine supernatural experience alone in your heart hallelujah why because when you have a supernatural experience in your heart it will change the way you live it will change the way you talk it will change the way you walk it will put a smile on your face it'll put a sparkle in your eye it'll put a spring in your step it'll put a song in your heart s-sir it will give you hope passion and determination that you've never had in all of your life that's right and so I challenge people everywhere that I go to please do more than just get an experience in your mind but please get an experience in your heart oh yes the young man did not just get some head knowledge but he got some heart not Alleluia praise God and I am so thankful today that I know who Jesus is people ask me Oh and over and over everywhere that I go preacher who in the world is Jesus who is he and you know what it thrills my heart and it excites me every opportunity that the Lord gives me to be able to share with someone who Jesus is yes it thrills me to be able to tell people who Jesus is you mean fact is more than nineteen hundred years ago there was a man born contrary to the laws of human life this man was born in poverty and he was reared in obscurity he never travelled extensively only one time that he crossed the boundaries of the country in which he lived and that was during his exile in childhood this man possessed neither wealth nor influence his relatives were inconspicuous and uninfluential and had neither training nor education but in infancy he startled a king in childhood he puzzled the doctors in manhood he ruled the course of nature he walked on billows as if pavement and he hushed the sea to sleep He healed multitudes without medicine yes and he made no charge for his service this man never wrote a book yet all of the libraries of this great country and other countries cannot hold the books that have been written about him man this man never sang a song yet he has furnished the theme for more songs than all of the songwriters combined he never found at a college yet all of the schools put together cannot boast of heaven as many students as he he never marshaled an army he never drafted a soldier he never fired a gun yet no leader has ever had more volunteers come on brother under his orders made more rebels of stack arms and surrender without a shot being fired he is the start of astronomy he's the rock of geology he's the lion and the lamb of the zoological kingdom he's the revealer of the snares that lurk in darkness he's the rebuke or of every evil thing that prowls by night yes he is the quicken or of all that his whole tsukumo he is the adorne er of all that it's beautiful he is the reconciler of all that is contradictory he is the harmonizer of all discord he is the healer of all disease all right but best of all today he is the Saviour and the friend of all mankind him anime every seven days the wheels of commerce cease and multitudes wind their way into worship and places to pay homage and respect to him the names of past proud statesmen of Greece and Rome have come and gone but the name of this man come on brother bounds more though time has spread more than nineteen hundred years between the people of this generation all right and the scene of his crucifixion he still lives of Herod could not kill him Satan could not seduce him death could not destroy him and thank God the grave oh yes not hold him Rachel he stands forth on the highest pinnacle of heavenly glory he is proclaimed by God he is acknowledged by angels he is adored by saints of and he's feared by every demon and the devil himself has been a living the incomparable of overcoming victorious Christ amen somebody asks the question who is he he is a manual God with us he is God's eternal purpose consummate yes he's loved eternal dream dramatized he's pities tears of his blood ease crystals he is a creator that is yielded to his creation he is justice and mercy in phone embrace he is eternal beauty adorning that appalling deformity he is divine sinew that is woven and interlaced with mortal flesh somebody asks the question again who is he who is he one writer under inspiration picked up his pen and began to write lo I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do thy will o God that's for Shelley the Bible that we love come on the one that we embrace the one that we cherish I'm gonna tell you that if you start in Genesis and you go all the way through to the end of Revelation or if you decide to open it in Revelation push rewind and go in Reverse all the way backward or you have some reason or other you just decide to randomly open the Bible if it makes no difference where you open the Bible at tucked between the pages of a nestled in every page in every book between the seams you're going to find Jesus Christ [Music] the end of the book Jesus is everywhere you look in the pages of our by blank you lord no wonder the Bible is a book unlike any other book in all of the world so truth the Bible is unlike any other book why because the Bible is a living word hallelujah it is a Living Word come on no wonder you can open up the Bible you can look at a passage that you have read over and over time and again no matter how many times you've looked at it no matter how many times you've read it because it is a living book every time you look at it it's fresh and it's alive chance its ministers think and it refreshes and it brings strength and I am thankful today that Jesus indeed came in the volume of the book fact is if you have a 1611 edition of the King James the Bible contains three million five hundred and sixty-six thousand four hundred and eighty letters seven hundred and seventy three thousand six hundred and ninety two words thirty one thousand one hundred and seventy-three verses of 1189 chapter so it has 39 books in the old up it has 27 books in the new there are 66 books in all when we combined them together there were 40 human authors of over a fifteen to eighteen hundred year period some of them thousands of miles apart who penned the pages of a Bible of mind as they were moved don't cause a Holy Ghost Alleluia amen I'm thankful today for the Bible I'm thankful that truly indeed it is not just a living book but I looked at it the other day and I just kind of thought about the Bible as an acronym and it's basic instruction before leaving Earth all right hallelujah that's what the Bible is it's just basic instructions before leaving Earth hallelujah you know what many of us depend on a GPS yeah that's right Applegate from place to place right in our world did you know that the Bible is the GPS okay Christian and that right the Bible is the road man crazy man it's the basic instructions that you and I need before leaving desert yes we do hallelujah and you know what when you look at it you discover that in Genesis he is the seed of woman in Exodus he is the Passover lamb in leviticus he's our high priest in numbers he's a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night in Deuteronomy he's a prophet like unto Moses of all day and Joshua he is the

he was joshua swalls but came tumbling down it was Rahab scarlet thread he was a cloud by day he was a fire by night he was clothed honey he was shoes that grew on there fiercer amen he was anything and everything that they ever needed him to be thank you Lord how wonderful it was that he just simply told Moses as a burning bush when Moses said who shall I say sent me he said you tell Pharaoh I am have sent you that you know it was at that moment that Jehovah Elohim decided to reveal to Moses the infinite never ending part or sad of his deity he said you tell Pharaoh I am I am what I am bread when you're hungry I am water when you're thirsty I am a life when you're in darkness I am a way when there seems to be no husband to the widow I'm a father to the orphan I'm a lawyer in the courtroom Oh hallelujah yes you know what the God that we serve is not just how one is not just going to be I will be but thank God today he is I ain't come of it you may be sicker sir but remember your servant I am oh maybe in the darkest hour but don't despair because your servant I am your back may be against the wall up unfortunate circumstances and events of it may have pushed you into a corner and you may feel today that you are completely surrounded by the demons of Hell and by the devil himself but do not fear because you are serving I am you are serving I am I am able to do exceedingly abundantly above in assess your cheese that you could ask her thing yes that's a wonderful thing today else I am has a name okay hallelujah if we go through the 400 years of darkness in Matthew he was a kingly Messiah in mark he was a Wonder worker in Luke he was a friend of sinners and outcasts but John had an experience with the Lord Jesus Christ the other disciples did not have and therefore when he began his book he began by saying in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of man the light shine ahthe and darkness and the darkness comprehended it not the Bible said that he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name Lord I believe the writer said for God has highly exalted him yes sir and given him a name that is above every name all right that at the name of Jesus Christ every every knee should bow to things that are in heaven to things that are on the earth to things beneath the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is his Lord the writer said neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven where given among men whereby that we must be saved now time won't allow me but I do quickly want to to go right to the last book of the Bible God spared a prophet from a pot of burning oil did marooned him on a deserted island and then let him eavesdrop on the coming eternity there so he could record the revelation of Jesus Christ which was with chills and which is his heaven the writer said I John who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in the isle that is called Patmos for the word of God and for the testimony of
