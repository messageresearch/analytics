TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Weist in you the hope award [Music] hello there I'm Pastor Steven Shelley and it's my joy to be able to come to you again in partnership with the gospel channel and speak to you from my heart from God's Word and hopefully share something that would be an inspiration and a blessing to you in your life we've been coming to you on a weekly basis for almost a year now with this hour-long broadcast and we just feel so very blessed to be able to serve you with the word of truth and also to be partners with the gospel channel help provide some programming that might be of help to you and we hope in the near future to be able to produce our 30-minute program again the Eagles cry so many of you still mention that and what a blessing it was to you and it's certainly in our hearts to bring that format back to you as well but we just we're just really thankful that God has given us this opportunity and the one-hour format I realize that perhaps it gets a little long for you sometime but it does give us the opportunity to go a little bit deeper into study and to lay the foundation and then build on that from week to week so I pray that you will bear with us in the length of the program that you'll stick with us we still get questions about hey I missed I missed episode three or I I missed the first episode of a particular series and what do I do about that well on occasion we have people who want to order it on a DVD and we can make that available on a limited basis we certainly can do that but the easiest way to catch up on any episode in a series that you've missed is to go to our youtube channel because on our youtube channel you will find all of the programs that we have produced in partnership with the gospel channel I think you'll see some of the Eagles cry brought ask that we have done for so many years and I'm real excited about a new outreach that the staff is putting together called new hope moments and you'll be able to see those we call them just little bite-size nuggets of inspiration and they are taken from our lives services here at New Hope revival Center in Smith Station Alabama and I feel like that you would be blessed if you visit our YouTube channel and if you go up and press the subscribe button then you will be notified by email when new content is added YouTube does that automatically and let you know that we have added a new video whether it's a gospel channel broadcast or the new hope moments or music sometimes we put on songs from our services whatever the content is you'll be notified I'd really like to tell you about something that I'm very very excited about and may take me a minute or two to do it many many years ago when God began to stir our hearts for what the future would look like this was you know around 1990 perhaps 1991 I had already been in the ministry for a long time I think some of you know my testimony I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost when I was seven years old and as incredible and outlandish as it sounds I started into public ministry shortly thereafter and had a traveling ministry from the age of seven on preaching the gospel praying for the sick and not just to children or to young people sometimes I would be invited to come and do a special revival for young people or for children in particular but the the main part of our ministry for so many years was in a revival type set and we would be invited to go in for revivals and sometimes they would let be scheduled for three days and last three weeks and sometimes even longer than that and those were wonderful days in 1988-89 I had some powerful encounters with the Lord and I tried to be obedient to the leadership of the Holy Spirit and he led me to some truths that radically changed my life satisfied me in the word in a way that I had never been satisfied before and it became my desire then to to use the gifts and the talents that God had placed in my life in the calling that he had placed on my life and and used that ministry and my gifts to help bring people to the same truth that so changed my life and I often refer to it as the revelation of Jesus Christ because it is such an unveiling in the word and once you know once it becomes a part of who you are it really changes you forever and so what really happened in in 1990 the Lord brought me home back to the city of my birth Columbus Georgia and I ended up my grandmother what had been a minister for many years she had stepped aside from her role and not too long after that the Lord took her home and she was such a very godly and powerful influence in my life she had shared so much truth with me and I rejoice that the Lord then toward the end of her life gave me the same opportunity to share truth with her that that really deeply impacted her life at times when we would study or we would listen to sermons together she would say you know I've been waiting on this truth I've been waiting on this understanding this revelation and so in 1990 I left the church that I was pastoring in another came home to Columbus Georgia and I began to pasture the home church and I wished I could tell you that that everything was smooth as glass but as often is the case in church work we we hit some pretty big bumps in the road and I obviously had a different style of presenting truth and pastoring then my grandmother had years before and so there were struggles but toward the end of 90 and into 91 God began to send people to me that that you know he just brought them alongside of me and they were excited about what God was doing in our little Church in Columbus and they wanted to be a part of reaching out of taking it a little bit beyond the four walls of the church and so we had some precious friends who were living in Canada in Alberta Canada some of them actually made a move to come to Georgia to come to Alabama and to help us in the outreach and others remain there in in Edmonton Alberta Canada and God used them also to help us in amazing ways my testimony was printed in a book that was entitled write the vision and that testimony book was sent out free of charge to pastors and ministers all over the world and as soon as that book got out there were many invitations that begin to come in and the ministry expanded rapidly over the course of the next few years all of that testimony by the way I've never shared any of that with you here on these broadcasts so you're getting something out of me that I didn't come in here prepared to share but around 1991 we knew that God was really going to open doors that that at the time we didn't even know what the doors would look like let me give you an example there were already little groups of believers of precious friends all over the world who had felt connected in the spirit and I know some of you will understand that I mean some of them were people we had never met face to face but they felt connected with the message that we were bringing and we were excited about it and they also were excited and so they wanted to share our services well in 1991-92 the internet wasn't was nothing to be heard of much at all and we we knew that there was an old technology that dated back to the 60s that people would use called a telephone hookup where you would call and basically you would be placed on hold like if you called the doctor's office and while you were placed on hold then whatever sound was coming into that system you would hear it on your on your telephone on the handset of your telephone and so people began to write and call and they said we want to be on the telephone hookup so we had a maybe one or two lines in the beginning and we ended up with a dozen or more telephone lines in our little church and people would call in and we would write their name or their city record where they were from and we would flip that switch and they would share the services with us and obviously I don't have time to share with you the testimonies but there were hundreds of testimonies that came in in those days of people being so blessed and so strengthened especially those who had no church in their area that they could feel connected to but God began to speak to us about a time that that there would be other technology available and I remember you know boldly declaring that there will come a time that not only will we be able to allow people to hear our services live but they will also see them and of course there were many of us younger people that said yeah that I know that's gonna be but there were some who said no way no way I mean that you know that's just not going to be but as you know technology has continued to roll on and now we have people streaming our services both audio and video all over the world we registered our domain on the World Wide Web back in those days revival dot o-r-g and had we known what then what we know now we would have got all the revival domains but we got revival org and we put up as soon as as soon as we could we begin to put up websites and we began to share but I remember one day in our offices in Columbus Georgia computers were really dull in in the late 80s and early 90s we're not talking about backlit screens and fancy screen savers and and and something that looks nice to the eye you know basically I was looking at a blank screen with a little green hue to it and but some of the folks who were working with us in Canada had had downloaded a software that would let us chat with one another now I know that most of you cannot imagine that because we text on our phones and we can talk to the world but in those days that was not happening and it certainly wasn't happening in church work and so I remember standing there one day when a brother from our who partnered with us in Canada he sent a message and I watched this little flashing cursor move across the screen h-e-l-l-o hello and hello brother Shelly and you know literally I jumped up and down I said this is the most amazing thing I can communicate with my brother we were working on the testimony book and we're working on other outreaches and and letters were coming in that we needed to know how to answer and and here is a way that we could communicate without making a call and so in those days the Lord began to let us know that there would be there would be technology and there would be outreaches and we have seen God so faithfully do every bit of that we are connected with Saints literally in almost every nation of the world but recently we have launched an app for your smartphone and it's it's already getting a lot of good feedback and the reason why I went all the way back through all that history that might be a little boring for you is when I got the word that we were about to go live with that with that app and I and I looked at all the hard work that our staff had put into making that possible how easy it is to access everything I jumped up and down again I cried a little I laughed a little I praised God a little and it so reminded me of that excitement that I had almost 30 years ago when those little little that little cursor moved across the screen and I said this is revolutionary well I believe our app is revolutionary and I just want to mention it to you and I want you to know that you can visit your App Store you can search for New Hope revival ministries you can find the app it is absolutely 100% free of charge you can download that onto your phone or your or your device that you used to connect and you can have access to a lot of our material and I'm telling you we're going to be adding to it on a very regular basis it's going to be a wonderful blessing in your life I know and just remember that you can search all of the various app stores the Apple Store and whatever you use for your Android device it's there and Roku it's there Apple TV it's there and there may be even a few other formats that are available that will let you know at a future time we're just really learning about it even now every day I get a little more excited about it you will find sermons from our ministry but you will also find sermons from the Ministry of brother William Branham which I know will be a blessing to you it was his ministry that so changed the direction of my life and answered so many hundreds and thousands of questions that I had had since I started studying the Bible as a seven-year-old boy and you know I recognize that everybody doesn't look at it the same way that I do but you will have availability you will be able to hear the sermons there's video content there's audio content and then there was a precious friend and mentor of mine whose name was brother Perry green and originally from Beaumont Texas he wasn't born there but but that's where he ended up in business and in ministry so many years ago and he was connected to the ministry of brother Branham and he had so many phenomenal experiences in the meetings he saw so many profound miracles and his life was such a blessing and such an encouragement to mine he went home to be with the Lord now going on for years and I had the precious honor and privilege of preaching his memorial service when he went home to be with the Lord and there are other ways that you can access some of the sermons of brother Branham on the on the Internet there are ways that you can also access some of the sermons of brother green but we wanted to take what we consider the best of the best and share it with you on our app so what that means is whether it's New Hope revival ministries the teaching and preaching that I do whether it's the Ministry of brother branham his teaching and preaching or even brother Perry green it will all be there on your smartphone on your iPad on your Android device even on your Apple TV or your Roku so you would be able to stream the content live and you know what I use it every day the thought crossed my mind I wonder if that's just because it's exciting and it's new but you know I think that the reality is no it's the convenience it's the convenience of having it in my hand I had a text this morning from a sister in our church she's been with us for quite a few years now she's a tremendous blessing and our local congregation she has a computer she has access to the Internet and has for years but she said I'm getting more out of the app there's just something about having it so handy I can take it in the yard I can take it to every room in the house there's just something about it so handy and she's going back and re watching and re listening and she said I'm getting so many new and fresh thoughts of ideas and revelations and encouragement by hearing what I've already heard so anyway that was unplanned I was just gonna spend three minutes mentioning the app but we believe that it is again another way our partnership with the gospel channel is another way that God is giving us to do what he's called us to do and you know I think sometimes the enemy tries to intimidate all of us and and say well know what makes you special and and why do you have so feel like you have so much to say but but really if God has called you if God is placed a calling on your life there is something in you that needs to come out and it will come out when you open your mouth when you surrender to the call of God on your life and it will come out in a way that only you could do it it will be said in a way that only you can say it if it's if it's art it will be painted in a way that only you could paint it and that makes it special it really does it doesn't mean you know we get criticized sometime people say you know you're always you're coming up with something you're doing all these different things it looks like you're promoting yourself well I I want you to know nothing could be farther from our heart it is not our desire it's not my desire to promote me because I am I am less than an ordinary Joe but because I know I'm called you know I I gotta say I know I know that he called me in my mother's womb and can I do things as well as someone else there are lots of things that I know up front I can't do as good as somebody else does but I can only do them when I do them I do them with the gifts the callings the abilities the talents that God has given me and it's gonna reach somebody you and I could preach the same sermon from the same notes and I would be able to reach someone that you would not be able to reach and vice versa you know some some people would be turning channels and they'd say I hate plaid and that guy's got on a plaid shirt and just keep keep turning or I hate chunky guys with glasses and just keep turning but but you might be sitting here with a nice striped shirt on and skinny as a rail and and that might be something that they'd rather watch and listen to and I said all that just to let you know that we are special you are special you who have said yes to the call of God on your life whether it's serving your neighbors in your neighborhood whether it's serving in the pulpit whether it's it's holding an office in your local congregation or as an intercessor for a local ministry a regional ministry an international ministry don't let the enemy intimidate you and we don't go forth promoting ourselves or trying to force our way in or push doors open I want you to know that that I call zero pastors and have called zero pastors in all these years of ministry to ask for an opportunity to speak I do not ever know of a time I can't think of a time ever since since I started the ministry in 1975 that's a lot of years now I don't remember one time that I ever picked up the phone and there were times that pastors would say call me when you've got an opening but I don't ever remember a time that I picked up the phone and said could you use the ministry do you have an open open date would you like for us to come by I didn't do that because I trusted and I'm not against that if that's how if that's how you've evangelize god bless you and be with you and thank God for open doors but I just sort of purposed in my heart and for years as an evangelist I needed open doors I wasn't pastoring and I needed those doors but God would open them in his timing so I want you to just note right now don't be discouraged if you're not seeing the open doors if you're not if you feel like you're not carrying the influence right now that God has intended for you to carry and and and things are just going bad you're getting a lot of criticism and look just draw near to the Lord use this time to draw your heart near to him because God has a timing for everything in our lives there's a reason for everything whether we can see it or not and there is a timing for everything so I just encourage you to to take advantage of all these different ways that you can connect not because we're so special but because we're doing what God has called us to do he's special the truth of God is special and we're going to present it in a unique way a different way than someone else and I know I can say confidently that I know they're going to be those of you on the other end of this television program the other end of the app on the other end of the YouTube channel I know that they're going to be those of you who are going to be blessed and helped and encouraged because that's the promise that the Lord made me he actually spoke into my heart as a very young boy and said you open your mouth and I will fill it and you know I wished I could say that I've that every time I've ever opened my mouth there was always him speaking but I can't say that because I have lots to say sometime just on my own but I can tell you that every time I've ever had to stand up and speak in his name he has inspired he has blessed he has encouraged he has helped me and I know others have been helped so I want you to know that all of these different outreaches are not to promote us I have a wonderful congregation of people I have a wonderful staff who have gifts and callings in their life but we're not here promoting us who we are but we're letting you know that there's a better life there's a better life in Jesus Christ there's even a better life than just Church Church is wonderful it's wonderful to be gathered together with with those of precious like faith but I want you to know that God wants to pour into your life and he wants to minister to you not only when you're sitting in church three times a week if you're that faithful but he wants to meet with you commune with you fellowship with you on a day-to-day basis and you're the only one who can open that door and create that atmosphere it's not going to happen automatic it's not likely that God's gonna come banging on your door and say hey I want some time with you you're going to have to to take the responsibility as a disciple and carve out the time and carve out the opportunity but when you do that in faith and you say lord I need you to meet with me by your printer presence with your presence I need you to meet with me with revelation and understanding of your word I just need to know that you're on the other end that we are connected and even though it's dark and I'm lonely and I'm struggling I need to know that you're out there I need to know that you're carrying me I need to be reminded that when I see those one set of footprints in the sand that you're carrying me we mentioned that on a broadcast not too very long ago so that's my I'm not going to say sermonette because I remember an evangelist in the United States who used to preach all over the world and and maybe still does to some extent but he used to say a sermonette is for a Christian ette who needs a bassinet so I'm not gonna say that was the sermonette but it was a little bit unplanned and it was an advertisement for the app it's free so it was a free ad but it was also for somebody I really believe that there is somebody watching this who just struggles in that area what do I have to give that's not already being given what do I have to say that's not already being said and it may not be that you've got something that hasn't been said but I'll tell you what it is you will say it in a way that somebody will be able to hear it and that somebody is it's for ordained of God if God gives you a message if he gives you a theme in your heart and in your life and he prepares truth in you he is preparing somebody it may not be the crowd of 25,000 could be it might be but he's preparing somebody to hear that word who needs to hear it from you because you're the one that God gave it to so don't be discouraged we need men and women of God we need people of God who will be faithful to the call and so anyway check out our website revival org send us your prayer requests we'll be more than happy to pray with you about them and even rejoice with you when the when the victory comes if you'll send the testimony the youtube channel and now the amazing New Hope revival ministries app on all of the major app stores so get that download that and let that be a blessing in your life and we're gonna keep adding to that and there there'll even be some printed articles and things that that you will have access to on that app it's really convenient now in the time that I have left I want to go back to our theme part 5 in the fullness of time we had great comments about episode 4 where we talked about the seed of the woman and this messianic prophecy that is so powerful and and really so encouraging because God has done through Jesus exactly what was prophesied that he would do but let's always go back to the foundation of the series we try to do that no matter what the teaching is galatians chapter 4 verse 1 through 7 now i say that the air as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father so already we're getting this message that there is an appointed time a chosen time and what I have found out about the Lord is Jesus keeps all of his appointments you and I get slack some time we may run late some time we may have to plus postpone we might have to postpone an appointment we might even have to reschedule we might even have to cancel but Jesus keeps all of his appointments he is operating in the time appointed no doubt about it even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come when time was filled up to the measure that God four or deigned it to be everything set in order the beautiful blueprint of God fulfilled to the right place when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because your sons God hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ so we have studied scripturally and and when I was looking over a list of the scriptures that we have covered already in this series we have covered a number of scriptures thirteen scriptures in the last episode 9 in the episode before 11 in the episode before that so we're really studying and learning a lot about scriptures that that some of these scriptures we've read many times in our in our Christian life but when we pull them together in the context of understanding that God had a plan before the world began and that plan is unfolding and you and I eventually we stepped on the stage as actors in the great drama that God had in his mind before the foundation of the world and you may feel like a complete and total failure right now but I want you to know that if you are a son of God you're going to succeed you are going to fulfill the man sure of what God has placed in your life and determined that you would do in this earth if you will continue to surrender and to submit yourself to his sovereign will your emotions my emotions will get in the way and and those those ants do you remember when we talked about ants automatic negative thoughts those ants will get in the way those programmed thoughts they didn't just come out of the blue we programmed them in by agreeing with the lies and we agreed with the lies and we agreed with the lies until those thoughts became a part of the real estate of our brain this is not this is not speculation it's brain science every time you entertain that negative thought ponder on it wake up in the middle of the night and think about it it is driven farther and farther into the deep recesses of your memory and therefore if you come into any kind of environment or atmosphere that could remind you of where you were what you were doing what you were seeing what you were hearing what you were smelling when those thoughts troubled you in the past and guess what here comes the ants automatic negative thoughts to destroy the picnic despoil you your life your mental health your emotional health and this is what we have to to be aware of I cannot tell you enough the importance of determining in your life I've got to stay healthy in my thoughts I must stay healthy in my thoughts we know that it's so much deeper now than just mind over matter and the power of positive thinking and and something that we dismissed years ago is just a bunch of self-help jargon but I want you to know it's way more than that the scripture is clear that as a man thinketh as a man thinketh in his heart in his mind so he is and some translations indicate that he becomes the man that he thinks he is I believe I believe that we can only become what God has thought about us when we align our thoughts with what he has thought about us and Satan is not going to lay down and play dead while you and I just step up into the fullness of our calling no no no we've said that multiple times on this program he is active he is seeking whom he may devour going back and forth like that roaring lion he is the accuser of the Brethren he is twisting words and doing everything that he can to break relationships and sever relationships and cut you off and separate you from the body from your family from your faith family and he's doing that because he wants to make it easier to pick you off because that's how it happens even in the animal kingdom if that if that aggressor if that predator can can find a victim a lamb or or a gazelle an antelope that has become weakened in its condition and because of its weakness it's separated from the group it's so much easier for even one adversary one wolf one lion to swoop in and carry that weakened separated member off into destruction Satan doesn't want to break your leg Satan wants to devour you he wants to completely destroy you and cheat you bankrupt you of everything that God has promised you in your life but if you are filled with the Holy Ghost then greater is He that is in you than he is in the world and God has this great big plan not only for planet Earth not only for generations past not only for all the big stars you know sometimes we look at people and we say oh they're there they're fulfilling such a big role they're just so amazing they're just so wonderful sometimes people watch on television and they make heroes out of movie stars and sports stars and singers and they think that because they are on stage singing and smiling and dancing and wiggling and and everything looks okay they're thinking wow that person has reached the pinnacle of success well if you're talking about a bank account then maybe those people have reached the pinnacle of their success but I want you to know that if they don't have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ they are emotionally bankrupt I don't care how good-looking the husband is how beautiful the wife is how amazing the home is and how extensive the auto collection is if they're not if they don't have that God connection because man was created with that void with that vacuum with that need for God not in a religious connection that you that you get on paper only but in that spirit to spirit communion and spirit to spirit fellowship and I want you to know that even after all of these years of serving the Lord since I was a seven-year-old boy and I am getting very close to my 51st birthday now and many times through those years the enemy has stepped in and tried to sabotage my closeness to the Lord the very one who loves me the most who wants my attention my fellowship the most Satan has tried and why because it's that twisting spirit it's that dividing divisive spirit that the enemy will send against us if I can pull you away from the oh away from other believers away from the atmosphere of what what we get when we come together and worship the Lord corporately I know that we need the be alone times of worship brother sister if I didn't have that I wouldn't be sitting here today if I was only here today because of the strength that I have gained in church I don't think I'd be here I don't I really don't think and I've had I've been in some unbelievable services but the biggest portion of my sustaining grace and strength has come from those alone times with the Lord we need that we've got to have it but there is also that corporate anointing that's released when we come together and begin to worship the Lord what amazes me is sometimes like this past Saturday night there was such an atmosphere that came in our service as we begin to worship the Lord and I looked around and I saw many people that were connected you're the king of all the ages and you need 1/3 of salvation you're the reason why we're singing release the sound let it rise in every nation [Music] you're the father if you're that all-consuming fire no the reason are we [Music] we will be the generation calling down real joy be there ten [Music] we live [Music] hi and really feeling the presence of God and enjoying their time of worship and expressing their love for the Lord and then I had a call a few days later from a sister who had received the most awful news concerning the help of her husband and she was in her car the phone I think laying beside her streaming the worship from our church that Saturday night and she said my son was leading worship she said Benjamin had no way of knowing what I was dealing with how alone I was feeling at that moment but the atmosphere I could feel it in my automobile all that blesses me that blesses me because we were having a corporate moment she was having an individual moment and yet I realize that there were other people perhaps if you talk to them later they'd say well yeah we had a good service we had a good worship service Saturday night but but not not really having experienced anything particular and a lot of times that's just because these things are a bit relevant it's whether or not you're making the extra effort to be connected I'm going to be connected we talked about how well connected we are because of all of our technology and our devices and I'm I'm not here to criticize that because I believe God is using television there is a lot of filth and garbage and rottenness on the television but God is using networks like the gospel channel to give us a platform to be who God has called us to be and share with you what God is placed in our lives and and people are being changed and affected by it in a profound way there there's pornography and smut and and hideous things on the internet but God is using the Internet the the smartphone gives you access to darkness to witchcraft to to to the worst of the first but that also gives you access to gospel truth that can change you so what makes the difference in every one of those situations me you as an individual what I choose I choose to use the Internet to help me in my ministry I choose to use the Internet to help me stay connected to what is happening in other places there are services I don't often get to stream other churches live but there are other services that I enjoy over the course of a week plugging in hearing what's being said in the preaching of the word and in many cases enjoying the music and being blessed and inspired by that sometimes while I'm doing something at my desk I have that playing in the background I chose I could have used it for the garbage I could have used it to go looking for the filth it's there but I chose to use it to encourage and strengthen myself in the same way with the cell phone it can connect you to everything that is unlike God but it can also help you stay focused on the things that you need to and I have to be honest with you I use social media I use social media for different things and I know there's a lot of stuff on social media that's not godly and there's a lot of it that's frankly depressing it gives some people an opportunity to be who they're not and you don't ever become better by being who you're not you become better by recognizing where who you are and asking the Lord to give you strength so it's not good to pretend it's not good to live with pretense but but I want you to know that social media can be a tool for you to express what God is doing in your life having gone through some surgery some years back I cannot tell you what it meant to me when I didn't feel like begging for prayer I didn't feel like doing a lot of things but but someone could post a prayer request for me and when I felt strong enough I could go down and read we're praying for you brother Shelly we know God's gonna heal you he's gonna and I have to tell you that encouraged me and strengthened me but I have to make the choice and I have to I said all of that to say that I've been spending less time on Facebook and Instagram lately because I now have the new hope revival ministries app and I know that sounds kind of self-serving or funny or whatever but I mean that I'm hearing sermons and and I'm listening to things I'm getting to hear things that I had access to i sermons of brother branham and servants of brother green and brother green's testimony and the life story of brother Branham things I could have access but because it's right there on my phone I can just listen when I was getting ready to come to the office today and and and tape these programs I was listening to a sermon of brother Branham and it happened to be one of the sermons from Birmingham Alabama when my grandmother was in the service and and I couldn't hear her a man's and I couldn't see her but it warmed my heart to know that that this was way back in what 64 and 1964 and I'm listening to the same message that she was listening to that night it blessed me and so we make we have to make the right choice we have to decide there are certain things I cannot have in my life there are certain things that I need in my life there are certain things I want in my life but I have to I have to make up my mind I have to discipline myself I have to stay in these godly boundaries because I believe that we are in the end of the end time and I believe they're the only thing that's holding back the rapture and resurrection of the Bride of Christ is that there are there is more work to be done I hope you don't find that as a contradiction for me to say I believe we're almost there and then tell you I believe there's more to be done I I don't believe that's a contradiction and I don't want you to see it that way I believe that if you can feel in your spirit that we're getting nearer to that time then you must also be able to find that place of deeper surrender Lord what do you want me to do what do you want me to say who do you want me to be remember that it's not always the doing more but it is always the surrendering more the submitting more to what God's will and plan is and if you want to know what someone filled with the Spirit of God lives like or should live like well we look at Jesus as our ultimate example now that being said we can't all be itinerant ministers wandering around the countryside with a few disciples but his life was about the kingdom and he lived it in the life that God had called him to live that he was to live at that time we can model that we can so fill our lives with the wisdom of the word that when people ask questions when they inquire about our faith we have the wisdom of the word the knowledge of the word the revelation of the word to give them instead of the dry can't those those canned answers that religion sometimes provides it feels like I've been just a bit scattered in this program but I I have to tell you I I feel the pool of faith I feel like there are those on the other end of this camera who are pulling because you need a burst of energy of strength and focus I'm going to do something I don't usually do but I'm gonna stop right now we have about eight minutes left I want to pray right now I want to pray that as you make up your mind right now this moment to tune your spiritual dial to folk on the Lord to focus on the one who loves you the most and he knows you you know you may be hiding something from people but you're not hiding anything from God he already knows and he loves you just as you are but he loves you too much to leave you that way he wants to bring change he wants to give you strength to make changes that need to be made I'm speaking to some discouraged workers too some servants of the Cross who have really been dealing with heaviness and discouragement hopelessness but I just want you to know right now if you'll focus if you'll turn that dial back toward the Lord right now when we pray I believe God will give you the strategy to start dealing with that hopelessness that darkness that's trying to surround you father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah we approach you today in the natural we have no way of knowing who's watching this program but Lord you do you know right now whether this is being seen on the gospel channel or on the app or on YouTube and you know exactly who's sitting in front of this message right now and Lord I'm just sensing so deeply that there are some very discouraged servants of the Cross and I ask right now that you will release strategy and answers to their deepest questions I pray that you will help them find the truth the answer that they're searching for and that they will rise up with such faith that darkness scatters that hopelessness is dealt with by answered prayer Lord the best way I know to see Hope deferred and hopelessness dealt with is for you to come on the scene with answered prayer and asking you in faith right now according to your will I don't know your plan for each individual's live but I trust you and I know you do I pray that whatever the hindrance is if it's unconfessed sin that's keeping the answers to the prayer from coming I pray right now that the grace of God will touch their heart and they will confess to you in repentance of what needs to be made right and plunged beneath your blood and and have the spirit of justification operating in that area of their life I pray that whatever it is if it's if it's leagues if it is connections that have been made partnerships that have been made that are unhealthy if there are alliances that have been made relationships that have been formed that are not of God that the enemy has raised up to try to stop the flow of the anointing and God's blessings in their lives I pray that you will reveal that and not only will you reveal it but that you will release the courage to do something about those relationships to break unholy alliances in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I pray right now that you will take this effort that we have put forth today and let these words ring in somebody's heart if they're not ready to pray with me right now I pray that you will keep pressing and keep moving over them until they are ready to call on you I pray that you'll give some the courage to write this ministry to call this ministry and let us know I was one of those battling with discouragement and hopelessness but I'm I have a little little restored hope and energy to press into the more something is beginning to move and I am going to go with a new determination until every bit of that is broken off of my life Lord we ask this because we know it is vitally important that we all surrender our gifts and talents and callings to you we are a part of this great big plan this great big blueprint in the fullness of the times and so we just ask right now that healing would flow to those who are fighting some are not just fighting sickness but they are underneath an attack of the spirit of infirmity and Lord we ask right now that as our faith joins with their faith you will send the spirit of infirmity packing that he must go right now take his hands off the children of the Most High God let there be deliverance in areas where there has been addiction let somebody take a hold of the help that is being offered to them by the Holy Spirit right now Lord we ask that you bless the pastors and leaders who might be watching this program right now that they might go on with renewed vision and maybe they're at this place in their life right now because you want to take them into a new place of truth maybe you want to bring them to a deeper revelation of truth and so they're in this holding pattern it could be Lord that they're stalled because they can't go any higher where they are right now there they need another installment of revelatory knowledge and help that comes more of the unveiling of your word and your person in their life and so we just would ask that they would step up into that that there would be a hunger stirred we ask all of these things and for every need to be ministered to by the abundant grace and blessing we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory amen and amen I don't always close my eyes the entire time when I'm praying with you because I want to be mindful that you we're talking to the Lord but I want to be mindful that you're there I want to know and feel and sense and if you're watching this I you to know that that we're here because we haven't forgotten we do this because we want to reach out and and I'm going to say again I just believe that before we ever come into this little studio god knows who's going to see this he knows there will be critics he know that he knows that there will be those who don't need this who don't want this who are not interested in what we have to say they don't like the package maybe they don't like the blue wall maybe they don't like the sign over my head well you can't even read it your heads in the way I mean they're going to be people that way I don't like beards but God knows that you're going to be there as well and that you are going to receive something he knows when we come out that's he knows exactly who I might know somebody's going to but he knows who that somebody is and hopefully at somebody's we want to continue to pray with you about your place where you are right now your needs so reach out to the ministry the information will be given and you can let us know we're gonna keep praying for you standing with you because we love you god bless you bye bye for today [Music] [Applause] [Music]
