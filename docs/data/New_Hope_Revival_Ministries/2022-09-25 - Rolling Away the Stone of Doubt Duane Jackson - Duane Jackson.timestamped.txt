[54:01] we're trying to remind you that you're
[54:03] not the only one tired
[54:05] what about the people up here on this
[54:07] platform you they think there's any
[54:09] tiredness up here
[54:11] you think brother Dwayne and sis and
[54:13] sister are tired they didn't sleep much
[54:15] last night
[54:17] had a hard time getting ready with a
[54:19] little baby brand new baby you think
[54:21] they're tired you think anybody up the
[54:23] sound booth is tired
[54:25] I would ask you to raise your hand if
[54:27] you're tired but I don't think that
[54:29] would do a thing for us
[54:31] [Music]
[54:32] buy us would it
[54:34] but I don't
[54:36] come
[54:38] let me tell you something I had to get
[54:40] help almost
[54:41] I had to turn on my hip to get out of
[54:44] bed
[54:45] in the middle of the night to get to the
[54:47] bathroom because I jumped around a
[54:49] little bit last night
[54:50] and woke my sciatic nerve up
[54:53] and when I was able to get dressed and
[54:56] get in the vehicle to come this morning
[54:57] I said to the kids I jumped around last
[55:00] night until I'm hurting but I'm going to
[55:03] church to jump some more
[55:05] can I ask you from the bottom of my
[55:08] heart from With all sincerity what else
[55:10] is there
[55:12] what else is there but to worship Him
[55:16] but to live for him
[55:18] but to give him everything
[55:21] we're a blessed people and we have
[55:24] received of the Lord and from the Lord
[55:26] for so long the least that we can do is
[55:31] give him something I'm not talking about
[55:34] lip service
[55:36] I'm talking about a life that says you
[55:38] mean more to me than my feeling
[55:41] you mean more to me than my tiredness
[55:43] than my sore back or brother Dwayne had
[55:47] a
[55:48] real pain in his back last night after
[55:51] ministering to us and
[55:53] we just push through
[55:56] we've had congestion I've had congestion
[55:58] two weeks and I know some of you have
[56:00] and lay down at night and you're drip
[56:02] and drip and drip and drip and drip but
[56:04] what do we do we can't stop
[56:08] We Can't Stop
[56:11] not in the middle of what God is doing
[56:14] for us
[56:16] I want to tell you where we are this
[56:19] morning I want to tell you where we are
[56:20] I'm going to take just a few minutes
[56:22] this is my special song
[56:25] and I said to the Lord when he woke me
[56:27] up this morning he woke me up to the
[56:29] sound of the shofar
[56:31] and I've had several experiences with
[56:34] the Lord since Sunday night
[56:36] excuse me since Tuesday night
[56:39] at the end of the service we just spoke
[56:42] for about 10-15 minutes to the church
[56:44] about keeping our standard as high as
[56:48] possible
[56:49] because the world is looking
[56:52] not only is Holy Ghost looking in Jesus
[56:54] but but the world is looking and we
[56:58] can't afford to lose our standard now
[57:00] we've got to hold on to Holiness with
[57:03] everything that we've got because the
[57:06] world is looking
[57:08] and that's why that's why we're called
[57:10] to this
[57:11] it's not our salvation
[57:14] our Salvation is by grace and purchased
[57:17] by the blood
[57:19] but two times since then
[57:22] not including last night but two times
[57:24] in the night had such a powerful
[57:26] confirmation from the Lord that we're
[57:29] being lifted in the spirit to a higher
[57:32] place and it's worth every effort
[57:36] it's worth the extra push
[57:39] to be lifted up into something fresh
[57:43] their their spiritual of blessings and
[57:47] experiences in him in New Dimensions in
[57:50] the spirit that we have never
[57:52] experienced in our lives before and we
[57:56] want everything he has for us
[57:58] because we don't believe it's just for a
[58:00] Feeling
[58:02] we believe it's for change
[58:06] I want to read you a verse of scripture
[58:07] because
[58:09] there are people from time to time who
[58:12] get offended or put out by a lot of
[58:15] things we do around here
[58:17] and one of them is because we mentioned
[58:20] the biblical feast
[58:22] and a lot of people get out of that they
[58:24] don't like that and they think that's
[58:26] Jewish and they think that's not
[58:28] according to the message and brother
[58:30] Branham didn't talk about those things I
[58:32] beg your pardon
[58:34] he did
[58:36] when the Sun goes down tonight we're
[58:38] we're at Yom trois
[58:41] and it is the Feast of trumpets does
[58:43] anybody believe he ever spoke about the
[58:45] Feast of trumpets
[58:46] he did
[58:48] anybody ever believe he spoke about
[58:49] Passover
[58:51] Pentecost anybody ever hear him preach
[58:54] about Tabernacles I have
[58:57] and when I woke up this morning I heard
[58:59] the clear sound of a shofar followed
[59:02] by the clear sound of a silver trumpet
[59:04] and I knew the difference in the sound
[59:07] because they have a distinction in their
[59:09] sound you've heard that Illustrated for
[59:11] us here
[59:12] in First Corinthians chapter 15 I want
[59:15] to show you the significance
[59:20] it is the it is the blasting it's the
[59:22] Awakening blast
[59:26] picture said behold I show you a mystery
[59:30] we shall not all sleep
[59:32] but we shall all be
[59:34] changed stay right with me in a moment
[59:38] in the twinkling of an eye at the
[59:43] that's Yom trois
[59:46] the last Trump
[59:48] when the Bible said the first Trump he's
[59:51] referring to shevolt
[59:53] Pentecost because the Bible said that
[59:56] when he appeared
[59:57] on top of Mount Sinai in giving the law
[1:00:01] and instruction to Moses there was the
[1:00:04] sound of a trumpet
[1:00:06] and the scripture refers to it later as
[1:00:09] the first Trump
[1:00:11] and then it talks about here last Trump
[1:00:16] and the Hebrews know
[1:00:18] that the last Trump
[1:00:20] is the resurrection Trump
[1:00:23] it's the one that calls the elect to
[1:00:26] rise up it's called The Awakening blast
[1:00:28] so when the Sun goes down tonight we are
[1:00:31] remembering one more year these are
[1:00:33] rehearsals
[1:00:35] these feasts are rehearsals and we don't
[1:00:37] keep the feast and we don't make nearly
[1:00:40] as much about it now as we have in the
[1:00:42] past because we feel like a lot of
[1:00:44] people have maybe got it and some have
[1:00:46] gotten over it
[1:00:48] but we feel like there are times that
[1:00:50] the spirit says Market
[1:00:53] and I believe he said to me this morning
[1:00:54] Mark this
[1:00:56] put it down make sure you remember what
[1:01:00] you're what what you're Where You Are
[1:01:03] said in a moment in the twinkling of an
[1:01:05] eye at the last Trump for the trumpet
[1:01:08] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:01:11] Incorruptible and we shall whoop
[1:01:15] we shall what
[1:01:18] we shall be changed for this corruptable
[1:01:22] must put on
[1:01:24] help me now and this Mortal must put on
[1:01:28] immortality
[1:01:30] [Music]
[1:01:31] and brother Branham said in the Rapture
[1:01:33] message you mind can I take a minute I'm
[1:01:36] going to I have to
[1:01:38] because I told the Lord if no one else
[1:01:40] come forward with a song this morning
[1:01:43] that I would take this I would obey him
[1:01:45] I wrestled with him when he woke me up
[1:01:47] brother Adam said now it's the first
[1:01:49] thing is the sounding the first thing is
[1:01:52] a trumpet and or a voice a shout and
[1:01:56] then a voice and then a trumpet he got
[1:01:58] the order right as he continued shout a
[1:02:01] messenger getting the people ready the
[1:02:03] second is the voice of the Resurrection
[1:02:06] the same voice
[1:02:09] and if you think brother Branham is
[1:02:10] identifying his own human voice you're
[1:02:13] wrong because he was only an echo he was
[1:02:16] only a mouthpiece
[1:02:18] as brother preached to us last night he
[1:02:21] was only an amplification of
[1:02:23] The bridegroom's Voice
[1:02:26] but in case you get a little out of
[1:02:27] balance here he identifies the voice he
[1:02:30] said it's the same voice that loud voice
[1:02:32] in Saint John 11 38 through 44.
[1:02:35] that called Lazarus
[1:02:38] from the grave
[1:02:40] Lazarus
[1:02:41] come forth
[1:02:43] [Music]
[1:02:45] one of these days bride
[1:02:47] [Music]
[1:02:49] thank you
[1:02:52] [Music]
[1:02:55] oh my God one day the last Trump
[1:03:00] [Music]
[1:03:04] now that nothing I've said so far should
[1:03:07] get me in trouble
[1:03:10] but if I told you we don't know the day
[1:03:12] or the hour
[1:03:14] but we know the season
[1:03:17] it won't be in the spring
[1:03:20] won't be at Christmas time
[1:03:23] God keeps his word
[1:03:24] he keeps his pattern
[1:03:27] he died at Pentecost at Passover he died
[1:03:30] at Passover he became the Passover Lamb
[1:03:32] come on now that spring Feast we're
[1:03:35] coming now to this to the month when the
[1:03:38] Sun goes down we change months tonight
[1:03:40] we get the new moon in the new month
[1:03:43] and when we do we're going into a month
[1:03:46] of really focusing and concentrating on
[1:03:49] the things of God because in a few days
[1:03:51] we go into the days of all and we end
[1:03:54] this time of repentance before the Lord
[1:03:57] like like we had last night
[1:04:00] didn't you feel him as he came to say
[1:04:03] Amen to the preaching of the word and we
[1:04:05] just said Tunis Lord
[1:04:08] I don't want to be a nut here but it's
[1:04:11] almost like I could just feel the Lord
[1:04:13] tightening his people up just tightening
[1:04:15] us up well how do you know we didn't
[1:04:18] need to loosen us up well that's true
[1:04:19] some folks need to be loosened a little
[1:04:21] bit but I felt him tightening Me Up Just
[1:04:25] these
[1:04:27] these feet are dress rehearsals of what
[1:04:29] God has done and what he will do so we
[1:04:33] know the season we know that we are
[1:04:35] literally once again 2022 now we are
[1:04:39] entering into the season
[1:04:41] that one day
[1:04:43] [Music]
[1:04:44] this scripture will have fulfillment
[1:04:49] how do you know because God doesn't
[1:04:51] break the order of his word
[1:04:53] so one one fall
[1:04:56] as these things the reason why we don't
[1:04:58] know the day or the hour is because the
[1:05:00] calendar is off
[1:05:02] so we don't know exactly the day or the
[1:05:04] hour but we know the season
[1:05:07] whoa
[1:05:09] when we can start wearing jackets again
[1:05:12] we know we're entering into the season
[1:05:15] now let me stop no more commentary let
[1:05:17] me get this read so I can get out of the
[1:05:19] way
[1:05:20] I know people cringe when the pastor
[1:05:23] gets up like this in special meetings in
[1:05:25] it but I have to obey I I have to stay
[1:05:28] in good terms with my boss
[1:05:31] [Music]
[1:05:33] because he's going to talk to me
[1:05:34] tomorrow and I got to hear him tomorrow
[1:05:36] and the next day and the next day
[1:05:38] I can't afford to offend him
[1:05:41] how many of you feel that way I can't
[1:05:43] offend the Lord because I'm going to
[1:05:45] need him
[1:05:46] I'm gonna need him paragraph 153 he said
[1:05:49] now the third the first thing excuse me
[1:05:52] now the third thing well I didn't finish
[1:05:54] reading that did I did it yeah
[1:05:56] yeah no not quite did I
[1:05:59] that called Lazarus from the grave
[1:06:01] getting the bride together and then the
[1:06:03] resurrection of the Dead Sea to be
[1:06:05] caught up with it now watch the three
[1:06:07] things take place the next is what it
[1:06:10] was a trumpet a voice a shout a voice a
[1:06:13] trumpet
[1:06:15] shout to get the right biblical order
[1:06:17] shout voice trumpet let's say that shout
[1:06:21] voice trumpet he descends in a shout
[1:06:26] then the voice of the Archangel which is
[1:06:29] the voice that wakes the bride and then
[1:06:32] the trumpet that catches her let me read
[1:06:34] it he said now the third thing is a
[1:06:36] trumpet which always at the Feast of
[1:06:38] trumpets
[1:06:40] tonight it's sundown
[1:06:43] to the best of our ability on the
[1:06:45] calendar
[1:06:46] it's the beginning of the Feast of
[1:06:48] trumpets
[1:06:49] one of these days
[1:06:52] you won't have to hear this speech
[1:06:57] one season like this you won't have to
[1:07:00] hear this quote again you know why
[1:07:02] you'll be right smack dab in the middle
[1:07:05] of it
[1:07:06] he said
[1:07:07] that the trumpet which always
[1:07:09] the waste of trumpets is calling the
[1:07:11] people to the feast
[1:07:12] and they'll be the bride's supper
[1:07:15] the Lambs supper with the bride
[1:07:19] in the sky see does that excite anybody
[1:07:24] you people that strutted your stuff
[1:07:26] around here Friday night and acted like
[1:07:29] you were so glad to be dressed up honey
[1:07:31] that wasn't anything to compare
[1:07:34] with the feast I'm going to
[1:07:37] the marriage supper of the Lamb he said
[1:07:41] the first thing comes forth is his
[1:07:43] message calling the bride together we've
[1:07:45] had that
[1:07:46] the next thing is the resurrection of
[1:07:48] the sleeping bride we're having that now
[1:07:53] we're having that now
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:07:58] it's not just a physical death he's
[1:08:00] talking about
[1:08:03] back in the other ages he's talking
[1:08:05] about a physical death
[1:08:07] they're caught together
[1:08:10] and the trumpet the feast in the heavens
[1:08:12] in the sky he said why why that's the
[1:08:15] thing that takes place friends
[1:08:17] he said we're right here ready now the
[1:08:20] only thing the church coming out has got
[1:08:21] to lay before the sun to ripen
[1:08:24] [Music]
[1:08:26] while many have been ripening some have
[1:08:29] been rotting
[1:08:31] but the bride is ripening
[1:08:33] come on now Pentecostal seed is rotting
[1:08:38] denominational seed is rotting
[1:08:41] the message denominational seed is
[1:08:43] rotting but the broad seed is ripening
[1:08:47] in this hour the great combine will come
[1:08:49] by after a while the wheat will be
[1:08:51] burned the stalks but the grain will be
[1:08:52] gathered into its Garner if you believe
[1:08:55] that same man
[1:08:57] now in the message the Feast of the
[1:08:58] trumpets
[1:09:00] quick very quick
[1:09:02] he said now as soon as this church the
[1:09:04] bride is drawn together she is taken up
[1:09:07] and that mystery of the seventh seal or
[1:09:10] the seventh seal the mystery of going
[1:09:15] and the Jews listen and the Jews is
[1:09:19] called by The Mystery of the seventh
[1:09:20] trumpet
[1:09:22] which is two prophets Elijah and Moses
[1:09:24] and they come back seventh is last
[1:09:27] that seventh trumpet will also be the
[1:09:30] last Trump
[1:09:31] what brother Branham is telling us here
[1:09:33] it's the same trumpet that caused the
[1:09:36] bride out of the grave in the
[1:09:38] resurrection it's the same trumpet that
[1:09:41] caused the two witnesses on the scene
[1:09:45] he says it
[1:09:46] he said which is the two prophets Elijah
[1:09:49] and Moses and they come back
[1:09:53] now in another quote in the same message
[1:09:55] Feast of trumpets I'm hurrying he said
[1:09:58] in between the sixth trumpet and the
[1:10:00] seventh trumpet there is a prophet to
[1:10:02] appear before the Gentiles to call the
[1:10:05] people back to the original Pentecostal
[1:10:07] Doctrine that's happened
[1:10:08] [Music]
[1:10:10] now if that's happened where are we
[1:10:12] we're between the sixth and the seventh
[1:10:14] trumpet
[1:10:16] foreign
[1:10:17] [Music]
[1:10:19] caught between those trumpets
[1:10:22] because what the seals are to the
[1:10:24] Gentile bride the trumpets are to the
[1:10:26] Jewish elect he said isn't that right so
[1:10:30] we're caught in there somewhere he said
[1:10:31] Just Between the six and the Seven
[1:10:33] Trumpets the prophet to appear before
[1:10:35] the Gentiles to call the people back to
[1:10:37] the original Pentecostal Doctrine and
[1:10:39] then he goes on to say and the two
[1:10:41] witnesses of Revelation 11 appear to the
[1:10:44] Jews same timing
[1:10:46] to send them to Jesus while the church
[1:10:50] is being taken up all of them prophets
[1:10:52] amen the word of the Lord cannot be
[1:10:54] broken it won't be a denomination do you
[1:10:57] see it are you with me
[1:10:58] I got one more for you that are sleeping
[1:11:01] wake up if you've got a neighbor that's
[1:11:03] sleeping pinch them
[1:11:08] now when the gospel
[1:11:10] returning this is the revelation of
[1:11:12] Jesus Christ he said now when is the
[1:11:15] gospel returning to the Jews when the
[1:11:17] day of the Gentile is finished the
[1:11:19] gospel is ready to go to the Jews he
[1:11:22] said oh I if I could just foretell you a
[1:11:24] little something that's fixing to happen
[1:11:25] right here see right in this day you see
[1:11:27] it's fixing to happen
[1:11:29] we get it in the church age and this
[1:11:32] great thing is fixing to happen it'll
[1:11:34] carry over to Revelation 11 and pick up
[1:11:36] those two prophets Elijah and the Moses
[1:11:39] returning back for the Jews we're ready
[1:11:41] for it everything is setting in order
[1:11:43] just ready this Gentile message as the
[1:11:47] Jews listen
[1:11:48] as the Jews brought it to the Gentiles
[1:11:51] the Gentiles this is where we are
[1:11:54] hear me now
[1:11:57] hear me this is important to know where

[1:12:20] message to the Jews I'm just telling you
[1:12:23] what he said
[1:12:25] and how will we know that it has
[1:12:27] happened
[1:12:28] and the rapture
[1:12:31] will come that means
[1:12:33] there will be no Rapture until Gentiles

[1:21:09] amen I don't know about you but I tell
[1:21:11] you
[1:21:12] it has already been good to be in his
[1:21:14] house
[1:21:16] yes he is
[1:21:18] I felt him when I walked through the
[1:21:20] door this morning
[1:21:24] I felt his presence when I walked
[1:21:26] through that door this morning
[1:21:28] Satan was trying to come at us and do
[1:21:31] all sorts of things to discourage us
[1:21:34] he's a bluff
[1:21:36] he's a bluff he does not want you to
[1:21:39] enter in to his presence
[1:21:42] he will do anything and everything and
[1:21:44] he'll use anybody
[1:21:46] to try to keep you out of his presence
[1:21:49] you know last last night I shared with
[1:21:51] you a little a quote and I didn't have
[1:21:53] it written down
[1:21:54] and I don't like to to share things if I
[1:21:57] can't tell you exactly where I where I
[1:21:59] got it from
[1:22:01] um
[1:22:01] and I'll try not to keep you standing
[1:22:03] too long but I mentioned to you about
[1:22:05] being in the presence of God what
[1:22:06] brother Branham had said and and uh so I
[1:22:08] had to go back
[1:22:10] um uh last night when we got back to the
[1:22:12] room and and find it because I didn't
[1:22:14] want to just leave it
[1:22:16] um halfway done and it was in 1961
[1:22:20] in the message of God be with us then
[1:22:23] where is all the Miracles
[1:22:25] brother Brownell makes this statement he
[1:22:27] says how can you stand in the face of
[1:22:30] wind without having wind blowing
[1:22:33] how can you get in water without being
[1:22:37] wet water is wet
[1:22:39] that's not a big Revelation right but
[1:22:42] water is wet that's the chemical of it
[1:22:44] it's wet and when you get in water
[1:22:47] you're going to get wet right
[1:22:49] but the next quote
[1:22:52] and when you get in the presence of God
[1:22:55] the supernatural
[1:22:58] there is going to be Supernatural signs
[1:23:01] and Supernatural workings of a
[1:23:04] supernatural God
[1:23:07] I believe that we are in the presence of
[1:23:10] a supernatural God this morning and all
[1:23:14] we have to do is get our doubt out of
[1:23:16] the way
[1:23:17] and he can work he can perform because
[1:23:21] that's what happens when God shows up
[1:23:23] Miracles take place
[1:23:25] we're in the presence of a
[1:23:26] miracle-working god this morning if we
[1:23:29] can get ourself out of the way he wants
[1:23:32] to work
[1:23:33] he wants to perform it's what he does
[1:23:36] it's nothing major to him brother Steve
[1:23:39] that's what he does he works miracles he
[1:23:43] does the Supernatural and we are in the
[1:23:45] presence this morning of a supernatural
[1:23:48] God I believe it with all my heart have
[1:23:51] your seats for just a few minutes if you
[1:23:53] if you would and um I tell you
[1:23:57] I love coming here brother Steve because
[1:23:59] I feel just a liberty I I feel I feel
[1:24:03] like I'm not uh constrained
[1:24:07] by by time I even took my watch off I
[1:24:10] set my watch over there so it won't keep
[1:24:11] reminding me of if I move my arm I have
[1:24:14] a habit of looking down to see what time
[1:24:15] it is and so I put the watch over there
[1:24:18] and um I believe you've come to worship
[1:24:24] I've come to hear from him
[1:24:27] I need to hear from him this morning I
[1:24:30] do want to say before I uh before I
[1:24:33] forget and get too far
[1:24:35] um into talking this morning that we
[1:24:38] certainly I want to thank brother Steve
[1:24:41] sister Stacy for for hosting us this
[1:24:43] weekend and and inviting us to be a part
[1:24:46] of the the meeting and I tell you it's
[1:24:49] truly an honor an honor and a privilege
[1:24:52] uh to be with you and to be a part of
[1:24:55] what God is is doing here and um you
[1:24:58] know we there's a there's a connection
[1:25:00] that we have I don't know how many were
[1:25:02] here
[1:25:05] um in February of 2021 uh when brother
[1:25:08] Steve had invited me to come and speak
[1:25:10] the first time that I spoke here
[1:25:13] um
[1:25:14] and at the end of the service if you
[1:25:16] were here
[1:25:17] you may or may not remember a brother
[1:25:19] Steve
[1:25:21] um felt led to have a prayer and um he
[1:25:24] he prayed and in his prayer he was
[1:25:27] praying
[1:25:28] for me and sister Heather and um he so
[1:25:32] eloquently described different things
[1:25:34] that was that was going on and and and
[1:25:37] he had recognized
[1:25:39] um our desire to see other people
[1:25:42] blessed you know and even whenever we
[1:25:45] were going through a time it seemed like
[1:25:46] a dry spell for us but we were able to
[1:25:49] enter into Thanksgiving for someone else
[1:25:52] whenever when they were blessed and that
[1:25:55] is that is really a secret to a lot of
[1:25:57] things if you can ever you see some you
[1:26:00] see your brother or your sister blessed
[1:26:01] and you can enter in to that and be
[1:26:04] thankful for their blessing then you
[1:26:06] position yourself in a place that God
[1:26:08] can then come and bless you as well well
[1:26:12] through through the prayer he he prayed
[1:26:14] and and um you know there was there were
[1:26:17] things that were were trying to be put
[1:26:19] into motion
[1:26:21] um that where we were trying to to
[1:26:22] discuss things with doctors and and to
[1:26:25] to find out if there were other other
[1:26:27] avenues other ways we could approach to
[1:26:30] uh to see if the Lord would bless us uh
[1:26:33] with the biological child and even
[1:26:34] though they had told us time and time
[1:26:36] again it won't happen we still had faith
[1:26:39] we still believed that even through
[1:26:41] medicine I believe that God can work
[1:26:43] through medicine he has done it I've
[1:26:45] seen him do it and at the end of the at
[1:26:48] the end of your prayer do you remember
[1:26:49] what song you sing
[1:26:51] you don't well I do because I listen to
[1:26:53] the prayer again last night as we were
[1:26:56] that's one of the little things that
[1:26:57] when the Lord speaks to us and and he
[1:26:59] gives us words of encouragement
[1:27:01] Heather's been able to she would capture
[1:27:03] those and save them and throughout
[1:27:05] throughout the years we'd had different
[1:27:07] people would give us words of
[1:27:08] encouragement and if you could save it
[1:27:10] and you go back and you listen to those
[1:27:12] things
[1:27:13] and it helps to build your faith
[1:27:15] whenever you're in a low spot you go
[1:27:17] back and you listen to those things
[1:27:18] you're like hey God was talking to me
[1:27:20] right that night while I was there he
[1:27:23] was speaking to me I want to listen to
[1:27:25] his words again and God was speaking
[1:27:27] through brother Steve and and you all
[1:27:29] joined in prayer and and we have a
[1:27:31] manifestation
[1:27:32] of that Faith with us this morning in
[1:27:36] Little Liam
[1:27:39] [Applause]
[1:27:46] [Music]

[1:28:15] he is so wonderful
[1:28:18] so wonderful at the end of the prayer
[1:28:21] brother Steve sang a song as we were
[1:28:23] dismissed that evening
[1:28:25] you sang a song it is well
[1:28:28] with My Soul
[1:28:31] and if y'all would
[1:28:33] I'd like for us to sing that song
[1:28:35] together this morning as as we get ready
[1:28:37] to enter into the word I don't know what
[1:28:40] key y'all singing in whatever you play

[1:28:49] not well with your soul
[1:28:51] at this point don't leave this service
[1:28:54] this morning
[1:28:56] [Music]
[1:28:58] because he is here
[1:29:02] he is
[1:29:07] the same Jesus
[1:29:09] that walked over 2 000 years ago
[1:29:14] is here
[1:29:15] present Among Us this morning
[1:29:19] the same presence
[1:29:21] that Peter felt
[1:29:24] we have the privilege of feeling this
[1:29:26] morning
[1:29:28] the same Jesus that met Paul on the road
[1:29:31] to Damascus
[1:29:33] has come by here this morning
[1:29:36] to speak to me
[1:29:38] it's got to be personal
[1:29:40] you can't just sit there and say oh yeah
[1:29:42] he came and he came to talk to this
[1:29:44] person or that Pitchfork religion you
[1:29:46] know brother Stevie said oh that's for
[1:29:47] the so-and-so and oh that's for so and
[1:29:49] so you know no it's for me
[1:29:53] is for me he come to talk to me this
[1:29:57] morning
[1:29:58] would you join in song with me the song
[1:30:00] You Can't Sing sitting down I I sang in
[1:30:05] too many choirs and choruses throughout
[1:30:08] my younger years
[1:30:09] um had the privilege of singing in the
[1:30:12] North Carolina honors choir and the
[1:30:14] North Carolina All State Choir and the
[1:30:15] first thing that our instructor would
[1:30:17] tell us
[1:30:18] you got to stand up you can't sing
[1:30:21] sitting down because you can't get
[1:30:23] enough volume
[1:30:24] and this song requires volume
[1:30:29] you've got to lift it up to him
[1:30:31] you've got to lift this song up and
[1:30:34] really mean it and and what draws me to
[1:30:36] this song Oh I moved I got the wrong one
[1:30:39] pulled up that is not the right song
[1:30:41] Here We Go
[1:30:48] the third or fourth verse in this song
[1:30:50] and we'll sing it
[1:30:52] the fourth verse says Lord
[1:30:55] haste the day
[1:30:58] [Music]
[1:31:00] haste the day
[1:31:02] when my faith
[1:31:05] shall be sight
[1:31:09] this song was sung
[1:31:11] February of 2021 and things weren't in
[1:31:15] motion Heather wasn't pregnant we didn't
[1:31:18] know if she was going to be able to be
[1:31:20] pregnant but this song was sung
[1:31:23] and in the song it says Lord
[1:31:26] haste the day
[1:31:28] that my faith
[1:31:30] shall be sight
[1:31:32] and I believe that there's many of you
[1:31:33] that's been believing for certain things
[1:31:37] and it seems like it's been delayed
[1:31:41] but a delay is not a denial
[1:31:44] I heard brother Steve say that many
[1:31:46] years ago a delay is not a denial
[1:31:51] so what do we do we stand in faith
[1:31:53] believing and we say Lord I'm going to
[1:31:56] stand here until I see the Fulfillment
[1:31:59] of a promise that you gave
[1:32:02] I'm not standing on my own I'm standing
[1:32:05] on your word and I'm believing your word
[1:32:08] this morning Lord because you said it I
[1:32:11] can have faith in what you said
[1:32:15] not in my own thoughts not in my own
[1:32:17] thinking
[1:32:18] but I can have faith this morning
[1:32:22] I can have faith this morning and I can
[1:32:25] trust I can trust I can stand with you
[1:32:28] and believe for the need that you have
[1:32:30] because I have watched him perform in my
[1:32:34] life
[1:32:35] it took a few years
[1:32:38] they weren't always easy
[1:32:40] and it's not always easy while you're
[1:32:42] waiting
[1:32:44] but be patient in waiting
[1:32:47] don't grow weary in the waiting
[1:32:51] just keep holding on to his promise
[1:32:54] amen
[1:32:56] who in peace
[1:32:58] [Music]
[1:33:07] my way
[1:33:10] with
[1:33:13] Sorrows like sea
[1:33:17] pillows through
[1:33:20] [Music]
[1:33:30] thou has
[1:33:35] told to say
[1:33:38] it is the way
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:46] my soul

[1:42:07] thank you Lord
[1:42:09] father we just love you Lord
[1:42:12] help us Lord to get out of the way this
[1:42:14] morning that you might come and speak

[1:42:34] oh my mama

[1:42:43] appreciate your labor
[1:42:45] oh
[1:42:46] [Applause]
[1:42:47] thank you so much
[1:42:51] thank you so much
[1:42:53] I gotta get out of this
[1:42:56] got to get out of that this morning
[1:42:59] oh my mama
[1:43:04] don't forgive me I get a little bit
[1:43:05] excited sometimes
[1:43:10] when I think about what he's done for me
[1:43:16] why wouldn't I get excited
[1:43:20] why would I want to be quiet
[1:43:26] why would I not want to shout about it
[1:43:28] why would I not want to tell somebody
[1:43:30] about the goodness of my God
[1:43:32] [Applause]
[1:43:37] I don't want to hide what God has done
[1:43:39] for me
[1:43:43] I'd be wrong for hiding it right
[1:43:48] I would be wrong
[1:43:50] to hide and not give him thanks to give
[1:43:54] him praise for what he has done for me
[1:43:59] but brother Steve already read part of
[1:44:01] my scripture this morning so
[1:44:04] um I'll just pick up where you left off
[1:44:06] I suppose
[1:44:07] um
[1:44:08] we haven't talked
[1:44:10] except for a little bit sitting around
[1:44:12] the the dinner table but um
[1:44:16] I love it when God comes down and
[1:44:18] confirms things
[1:44:21] the Sister Mariah she she sang the song
[1:44:24] last night I had no clue she was going
[1:44:26] to sing what she sung I'm told that that
[1:44:29] was the first time that that she had
[1:44:31] sung that song here
[1:44:32] and um talking about your cries
[1:44:35] Awakening the master
[1:44:39] well that's in the message this morning
[1:44:42] too so wow I tell you the Lord just the
[1:44:45] Lord has a special way
[1:44:48] of doing what he wants to do when we
[1:44:51] will allow him to do it
[1:44:54] if we would just allow him to come in
[1:44:56] and have his perfect will that's right I
[1:45:00] don't I don't want his permissive will
[1:45:04] I'm not I'm not satisfied with that now
[1:45:08] there are some blessings even within his
[1:45:10] permissive will
[1:45:12] but I want the fullness of the blessings
[1:45:15] I want complete blessings I want to
[1:45:18] yield myself to a place that I can be
[1:45:21] found in his perfect will this morning
[1:45:25] amen you know there's a
[1:45:28] um in 1961
[1:45:30] um I think on the notes that I gave
[1:45:31] sister charity I I said 1964 and I
[1:45:35] didn't feel right about that I went back
[1:45:37] and looked at it this morning and it was
[1:45:39] 1961.
[1:45:41] um brother Bradham uh makes a statement
[1:45:44] now this is going to be an uh it'll
[1:45:46] sound like an odd service
[1:45:47] in the beginning but I hope you'll allow
[1:45:49] me
[1:45:50] um this uh
[1:45:53] by Folly if you want to call it that
[1:45:55] um
[1:45:56] I know this is not Easter
[1:45:58] but listen to what brother Branham said
[1:46:01] I want to I want to give you a little
[1:46:02] Easter story this morning and brother
[1:46:04] Brown said the message the greatest news
[1:46:06] flash in history
[1:46:07] but we allow Easter to One Day in the
[1:46:11] year that's our Easter One Day in the
[1:46:14] year is an Easter then he says
[1:46:18] every day in the year is or ought to be
[1:46:22] an Easter every day should be a thrill
[1:46:26] day of the Resurrection
[1:46:29] [Applause]
[1:46:30] that's what we've come to celebrate this
[1:46:32] morning is his resurrection
[1:46:36] every day should be an Easter I would
[1:46:40] ask you to turn with me in the Book of
[1:46:42] John this morning chapter 11.
[1:46:45] that you've already read from
[1:46:49] I'd like to start with verse 14.
[1:46:52] and 15 and then we're going to skip down
[1:46:55] to verses 38 through 40. and now you
[1:47:00] understand why I say brother Steve
[1:47:02] already started my message for me this
[1:47:05] morning and we're just going to carry on
[1:47:07] there's only one Holy Spirit
[1:47:11] only one Holy Spirit and as we said last
[1:47:14] night if we're tuned to the same thing
[1:47:17] we're going to be saying the same thing
[1:47:22] if I can get close enough to him
[1:47:27] there's going to be something that
[1:47:28] resonates through me this morning I
[1:47:31] believe that same Holy Spirit came down
[1:47:33] and was near brother Steve and it got
[1:47:36] near me and we're both saying the same
[1:47:39] thing you know why because we come from
[1:47:42] the same person we come from the same
[1:47:45] person of Jesus Christ
[1:47:47] we have that same representation
[1:47:50] dwelling inside of us John chapter 11
[1:47:53] verse 14 reads like this then Jesus said
[1:47:57] unto them plainly
[1:48:00] he's talking to this to the disciples
[1:48:01] that's with him
[1:48:03] Lazarus is dead
[1:48:07] verse 15 and I'm Excuse me and I'm glad
[1:48:10] for your sakes
[1:48:13] that I wasn't there
[1:48:15] I'm glad that I was not there
[1:48:19] to the intent there's a reason that he
[1:48:22] was glad he was not there to the intent
[1:48:24] you may believe
[1:48:27] nevertheless
[1:48:29] let us go unto him it was almost like he
[1:48:31] was getting a little flustered with him
[1:48:33] all right
[1:48:35] I mean
[1:48:37] let's let's go you're going to keep
[1:48:39] bugging me all right let's go to him
[1:48:42] let's move down to verse 38 through 40
[1:48:44] if you would Jesus therefore again
[1:48:48] groaning in himself
[1:48:50] cometh to the Grave
[1:48:52] it was a cave and a stone lay upon it
[1:48:56] right
[1:48:57] right Jesus said
[1:48:59] take ye
[1:49:01] away the stone
[1:49:04] why didn't Jesus just move the stone
[1:49:08] but it was something that they had to do
[1:49:11] something that they had to do he says
[1:49:14] y'all go get that stone moved out the
[1:49:16] way yeah take the stone out of the way
[1:49:19] Martha the sister of him that was dead
[1:49:22] saith unto him Lord
[1:49:25] um by this time he stinks he's thinking
[1:49:29] yeah for he hath been dead four days
[1:49:32] Jesus said saith unto her said not I
[1:49:37] said I not unto thee that if thou
[1:49:41] wouldest believe
[1:49:43] thou should have see the glory of God
[1:49:48] may the Lord add His blessings to the
[1:49:50] reading of the word this morning you may
[1:49:52] have your seats
[1:49:53] we look on the scene
[1:49:56] don't forgive me that um that singing
[1:50:02] I don't like to sing halfway
[1:50:05] I don't like to do anything halfway
[1:50:07] if I'm going to give give something to
[1:50:09] the Lord I want to give him everything I
[1:50:10] got
[1:50:12] I want to enter in with everything that
[1:50:14] I have because that's what he did for me
[1:50:17] as we look on the scene
[1:50:20] this morning this little Easter Story
[1:50:23] um
[1:50:24] it opens up with with Jesus being told
[1:50:28] about his friend a dear friend that he
[1:50:32] loved dearly
[1:50:33] and they come to Jesus and they're like
[1:50:36] hey
[1:50:37] your friend Lazarus and he's sick
[1:50:40] he's he's sick he really needs you
[1:50:44] and Jesus is like
[1:50:47] all right
[1:50:49] I guess he's sick well let's just go
[1:50:51] this way
[1:50:52] and I'm sure they're all looking at him
[1:50:54] like wait a minute
[1:50:56] now this is like one of your really
[1:50:58] close friends
[1:50:59] and he has asked for you I mean he's
[1:51:02] asked specifically that you would come
[1:51:05] right because Lazarus has a need
[1:51:09] and Jesus said he just kind of brushed
[1:51:12] It Off
[1:51:12] he's like yeah
[1:51:14] he's he's not sick unto death
[1:51:17] you know he he's going to be all right
[1:51:20] you know and I don't find any other
[1:51:22] place where they where somebody comes
[1:51:24] back to him and says he is dead
[1:51:28] but Jesus himself said he's just he's
[1:51:31] not sick unto death because he saw
[1:51:34] beyond what they were seeing
[1:51:36] you know he sees beyond what you're
[1:51:38] seeing this morning too
[1:51:39] you know uh but they they came to him
[1:51:42] and and they're like they've really
[1:51:43] tried to encourage encourage them they
[1:51:46] wanted him to to hurry to come see their
[1:51:48] friend there was an urgency that they
[1:51:51] were trying to express to him because in
[1:51:54] their mind hey he's about to die
[1:51:57] if you if we can't get him in front of
[1:51:59] Jesus or Jesus in front of him he's
[1:52:02] going to die and they they were trying
[1:52:05] to plead with Jesus hey we really want
[1:52:07] you to come he's he's almost dead if you
[1:52:10] could come we know that if you get in
[1:52:13] his presence and he's in your presence
[1:52:16] that Miracles can take place
[1:52:19] because they had seen the Miracles take
[1:52:21] place they knew that all it took was one
[1:52:25] touch from the Master's Hand
[1:52:27] one time to him going in there and just
[1:52:29] speaking to Lazarus and Lazarus would
[1:52:32] have been made whole right but he told
[1:52:34] him he said it was you know we read what
[1:52:37] he said while ago it was for an intent
[1:52:40] there was a purpose he delayed his
[1:52:42] coming
[1:52:43] for a purpose now he did not explain
[1:52:45] himself
[1:52:47] when he delayed his coming
[1:52:50] he don't you don't always get a written
[1:52:52] explanation of why you're still waiting
[1:52:56] I didn't get a written explanation 16
[1:52:58] years ago that said if you'll wait 16
[1:53:00] years in two months then then I'll I'll
[1:53:03] minister to you and I'll take care of
[1:53:05] you and we'll I'll fulfill the promise
[1:53:07] no I didn't get that I got a promise
[1:53:10] though
[1:53:11] it was up to me to hold on to the
[1:53:14] promise even though I couldn't see the
[1:53:17] Fulfillment of it
[1:53:18] there was doubt that was blocking me I
[1:53:22] couldn't see beyond the doubt he can
[1:53:24] he sees beyond the stone that was laid
[1:53:28] in front of Lazarus tomb you know all
[1:53:31] they could see is that rock whenever
[1:53:33] that there was a rock laid in front of
[1:53:34] him
[1:53:35] Jesus didn't see the rock because he was
[1:53:37] The Rock
[1:53:40] he didn't pay attention to that because
[1:53:42] he was seeing what was fulfilled already
[1:53:44] on the other side of that rock he's like
[1:53:46] he ain't dead
[1:53:48] he sleeps
[1:53:49] he sleeps don't let me get too far ahead
[1:53:52] of myself this morning he he
[1:53:54] um Jesus
[1:53:56] tries to explain some things to the
[1:53:57] disciples and um you know I guess
[1:54:00] they're they're kind of talking to them
[1:54:01] I'm sure they were kind of confused too
[1:54:03] they're probably thinking you know I
[1:54:05] don't understand why why aren't we going
[1:54:07] to go try to help Lazarus out you know I
[1:54:10] mean this is this is your really close
[1:54:11] friend Jesus we we really should go and
[1:54:13] and he tries to tell him he's like he's
[1:54:15] he's just sleeping he's just sleeping
[1:54:18] you know how how it is sometimes if you
[1:54:21] you know that somebody's sick and you
[1:54:23] called up their their home and um you
[1:54:26] know somebody answers the phone
[1:54:28] and they say you're trying to call to
[1:54:31] check on them you're concerned about
[1:54:32] somebody that's sick so you call the
[1:54:34] house and somebody else answers the
[1:54:35] phone and they're like they're
[1:54:37] Whispering you know right
[1:54:41] he's he's resting he's he's sleeping you
[1:54:45] know so when when Jesus was telling them
[1:54:47] he's resting he's sleeping the disciples
[1:54:50] kind of went oh well I guess that's fine
[1:54:53] you know it's good that he's resting we
[1:54:55] just you know let him rest wish we could
[1:54:57] be resting too you know we're being
[1:54:58] persecuted we're being chaste and we'd
[1:55:01] like to be resting too I wish that we
[1:55:04] could rest like Lazarus was resting
[1:55:06] because in their mind they're hearing
[1:55:09] him say he's sleeping so that's what
[1:55:11] they're perceiving that he's resting and
[1:55:13] they said it do it doeth them well
[1:55:15] if he's resting let him rest that's the
[1:55:18] same way we would say to somebody today
[1:55:19] don't bother them just let them know
[1:55:22] later when they wake up that I called
[1:55:24] was thinking about them just just let
[1:55:26] them rest don't want to wake them up
[1:55:27] while they're resting because they need
[1:55:29] that rest for their strength and so
[1:55:31] that's what they thought Jesus was
[1:55:33] telling them he's sleeping he's going to
[1:55:35] be all right and finally Jesus like
[1:55:37] listen y'all
[1:55:38] I got to put it plain he is dead
[1:55:44] and I'm glad
[1:55:45] for your sake that I wasn't there
[1:55:48] foreign to the intent
[1:55:51] see he had an intention
[1:55:53] of not showing up there was something
[1:55:55] that he was trying to do he was trying
[1:55:58] to get them to believe
[1:56:02] you know even though they had been
[1:56:03] around him all the time they've been
[1:56:05] around him they still were not fully
[1:56:08] believing in who he was they had not
[1:56:11] completely had a revelation of who Jesus
[1:56:15] was you know some of them that's why at
[1:56:17] one place he says you know who do men
[1:56:19] say that I am
[1:56:21] he that was a legit question he's like
[1:56:23] hey what's
[1:56:25] what's the noise around Camp what's
[1:56:27] what's people saying you know in these
[1:56:29] different cities when we go through I
[1:56:30] you know you know maybe I don't maybe he
[1:56:32] didn't hear all the things that they
[1:56:33] were saying and so he's like hey what
[1:56:35] are they saying about me what are they
[1:56:37] saying and all some say this and some
[1:56:39] say you're that and some and then
[1:56:41] finally he just stops he says but
[1:56:43] honestly I'm really not caring about
[1:56:46] what they're saying about me
[1:56:48] I was just kind of asking you that but
[1:56:50] what I really want to know is do you
[1:56:52] know who I am
[1:56:54] who do you say that I am it's got to be
[1:56:58] that personal revelation that sinks into
[1:57:01] your heart that you know who he is it's
[1:57:05] great that brother Steve knows who he is
[1:57:07] and he can preach who he is brother
[1:57:09] Wesley knows who he is that's great but
[1:57:12] do you know who he is have you had a
[1:57:15] personal experience with Jesus Christ
[1:57:18] have you had an experience on the road
[1:57:20] where he come down and he stops you in
[1:57:24] your tracks and says listen up I'm
[1:57:27] trying to talk to you I'm trying to show
[1:57:29] you who I am and that's what he was
[1:57:32] trying to do with the disciples that
[1:57:34] were with him
[1:57:35] they still did not know exactly who he
[1:57:39] was and so he was trying with his best
[1:57:42] intention he let his friend die
[1:57:46] let his friend die
[1:57:49] in hopes
[1:57:52] that this is going to be something
[1:57:54] that's going to open their eyes
[1:57:57] wasn't hope for him let me change that
[1:58:00] that wasn't a hope for Christ
[1:58:02] he did it with the intent and the
[1:58:05] knowledge that it was going to take that
[1:58:08] the Lord corrected me when I said that
[1:58:10] that wasn't that wasn't a hope of of
[1:58:12] Christ because he knew
[1:58:15] what was going to happen and he knew
[1:58:17] that was the only way that it was going
[1:58:19] to open their eyes is for that to take
[1:58:22] place it had to be something major
[1:58:26] and that was pretty major to let his own
[1:58:28] best friend die before them and he says
[1:58:32] I did it with an intent that you may
[1:58:35] believe I came across a poem
[1:58:39] um during my my studies for this message
[1:58:42] and and um
[1:58:44] I'd like to share the poem with you
[1:58:48] it says doubt
[1:58:50] sees the obstacles
[1:58:53] faith
[1:58:55] sees the way
[1:58:58] doubt sees the Blackest Night
[1:59:02] faith
[1:59:04] sees the day
[1:59:07] doubt
[1:59:08] dreads to take a step
[1:59:11] faith soars on high
[1:59:15] and listen to this part doubt questions
[1:59:20] who believes
[1:59:22] Faith answers
[1:59:25] I
[1:59:28] I believe I don't know who wrote the
[1:59:29] poem but when I came across it I'm like
[1:59:31] I gotta write that down because I love
[1:59:33] it doubt will ask you a lot of questions
[1:59:37] [Music]
[1:59:38] do you really think you can believe that
[1:59:42] but what if
[1:59:44] but has Satan never brought up the
[1:59:47] what-ifs to you
[1:59:50] you know you you think you're you're
[1:59:51] moving in the right direction you think
[1:59:53] you've got a you know you you come to
[1:59:55] church and you you get out of service
[1:59:57] and you're you're on just this this
[1:59:59] emotional High you know because the
[2:00:02] supernatural has happened God come down
[2:00:04] and he spoke to you and you walk through
[2:00:07] those doors and you get in your car and
[2:00:08] you pull out of the driveway and Satan
[2:00:10] says yeah but
[2:00:13] what if
[2:00:15] what if it don't happen that way
[2:00:20] what if it don't happen that way right
[2:00:22] what if tomorrow you wake up and your
[2:00:24] back still hurts right
[2:00:27] what if you get to the job and and they
[2:00:29] say
[2:00:30] sorry you don't have a job no more
[2:00:33] you know
[2:00:35] what if he loves to throw the what ifs I
[2:00:39] wrote I wrote it down one time the Lord
[2:00:41] I believe he gave it to me I know he
[2:00:43] gave it to me
[2:00:46] um and I had a I have I have him
[2:00:47] somewhere in one of my messages I've
[2:00:49] written it out what if
[2:00:53] w-h-a-t-i-f worry helps anxiety turn
[2:00:59] into fear
[2:01:03] there's your what if
[2:01:06] that's what if that's what Satan wants
[2:01:08] to do worry helps anxiety turn into fear
[2:01:15] because that's all he wants to do is he
[2:01:17] puts those little little doubts in your
[2:01:20] mind a little bit of worry a little bit
[2:01:22] of fear a little bit of anxiety and he
[2:01:25] just sows a little seed here and a
[2:01:27] little seed there and if he ain't
[2:01:29] careful you end up watering it and it
[2:01:32] grows up to something that's huge in
[2:01:34] front of you and then it's blocking you
[2:01:37] from seeing what God wants you to see
[2:01:40] and you can't see past it
[2:01:43] you get to a place that you just you
[2:01:45] can't see past it in 1961 in the message
[2:01:48] if God be with us then where is all the
[2:01:51] Miracles
[2:01:52] brother Branham says where is the
[2:01:55] Miracles at Among Us
[2:01:57] where are they at
[2:01:59] God was talking to this man getting him
[2:02:02] ready to go out
[2:02:04] move the clouds out
[2:02:06] the sun is always Shining
[2:02:09] that's right when doubts are gone and oh
[2:02:14] there's an and
[2:02:15] here
[2:02:17] it's a conjunction
[2:02:19] that means there's a second part that's
[2:02:21] right when doubts are gone and things
[2:02:26] are made right
[2:02:29] a lot of people forget about that part
[2:02:31] you know yeah I can believe I can
[2:02:34] believe but you haven't went and made
[2:02:36] things right with your brother you
[2:02:38] hadn't made things right with your
[2:02:39] sister that you offended
[2:02:41] and you haven't cleared things up that's
[2:02:43] right
[2:02:44] it ain't gonna work
[2:02:46] when doubts are gone and things are made
[2:02:49] right Miracles will be there just as
[2:02:53] sure as the s o n not talking about the
[2:02:58] s-u-n but assures the sun is there
[2:03:02] Jehovah Shama
[2:03:04] he is there he's always there
[2:03:08] the son by the command of God shines
[2:03:11] every day it's there because God
[2:03:14] commanded it there and as long as there
[2:03:16] is day and night the son s-u-n will hang
[2:03:20] there sure not all the time you see it
[2:03:24] because clouds has it covered up fog
[2:03:27] clouds lower high covers it up but it's
[2:03:31] always their scene
[2:03:32] and the only thing you want to do to see
[2:03:35] Miracles today how many wants to see
[2:03:38] Miracles today the only thing you want
[2:03:41] to do to see Miracles today if you want
[2:03:43] to see the miracle of God just move all
[2:03:45] your doubt away move all your Creeds
[2:03:49] away move all your denominationals away
[2:03:52] and there the sun s-o-n is automatically
[2:03:58] Shining
[2:04:00] if you can clear your doubt away the
[2:04:03] same son that was shining in Peter's Day
[2:04:08] s-u-n-n-s-o-n
[2:04:11] that same sun is shining right now
[2:04:15] the same Jesus I got it right here
[2:04:18] Hebrews 13 and 8. it's right here it
[2:04:21] reminds me right here on my tie attack
[2:04:24] tie clip not a Thai attack sorry
[2:04:27] it reminds me
[2:04:29] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[2:04:34] and forever the same Sun that's shown in
[2:04:39] Elijah's day
[2:04:41] we can walk outside and we see that same
[2:04:44] Sun that's right it's still Shining
[2:04:46] the Sun that we saw yesterday or you go
[2:04:49] out this afternoon and you look look up
[2:04:50] and you see that sun that's the same Sun
[2:04:52] that's shown on Moses
[2:04:55] the same Sun that's shown on Peter and
[2:04:58] Paul and John and Matthew and all of
[2:05:01] these that we read about that same s-u-n
[2:05:03] is still shining today
[2:05:06] and I'm here to tell you that the same
[2:05:07] s-o-n is still shining today the same
[2:05:11] Jesus Christ that walked with them walks
[2:05:14] with me right now
[2:05:17] right now he's a right now God
[2:05:20] I need him right now and he will show up
[2:05:22] right now if I can get rid of the doubt
[2:05:26] if I can clear up all of the doubt and
[2:05:29] make things right
[2:05:31] then I'm a candidate for the Miracles to
[2:05:35] take place
[2:05:37] I want to see the Miracles take place I
[2:05:40] have witnessed miracles in my life I
[2:05:43] know that there's different ones of you
[2:05:44] this morning that have witnessed
[2:05:46] Miracles Divine miracles
[2:05:49] in your life that's undeniable there's
[2:05:52] no way that anybody could take that away
[2:05:53] from you because it happened to you
[2:05:56] and I've witnessed Miracles but I want
[2:05:58] more
[2:06:00] I'm selfish I'll go ahead and tell you
[2:06:02] I'm selfish when it comes to the things
[2:06:04] of God I want more
[2:06:06] I'll do whatever I've got to do to get
[2:06:09] more
[2:06:11] if it means I've got to yell and scream
[2:06:14] and use my voice till it goes away I
[2:06:16] want more
[2:06:19] if it means giving up myself I want more
[2:06:23] hmm
[2:06:26] the disciples that were
[2:06:28] that hung around Jesus I like to call
[2:06:31] them doubting disciples
[2:06:33] he had to deal with them a lot
[2:06:37] you know because so many times he would
[2:06:39] he would talk to him and and they they
[2:06:41] witnessed so many miracles and they
[2:06:44] didn't have any any trouble believing
[2:06:46] you know who he was you know while he
[2:06:49] was kind of standing there with them
[2:06:50] most of the time
[2:06:52] um
[2:06:53] but then they they didn't fully
[2:06:55] understand you know they're like oh you
[2:06:58] know some people thought he was uh he
[2:06:59] was you know a prophet you know but many
[2:07:03] of them did not have a full
[2:07:04] understanding of who Jesus was as he
[2:07:08] stood there in front of them it just you
[2:07:12] know to them it was Jesus of Nazareth
[2:07:14] you know it was Joseph's son it was you
[2:07:17] know to many of them they couldn't get
[2:07:19] past that flesh body
[2:07:23] that God was dwelling in that's all they
[2:07:26] could see that was as far as they could
[2:07:27] see but it was God himself
[2:07:30] Jesus Christ was God himself manifested
[2:07:33] in flesh
[2:07:34] you and I
[2:07:36] are supposed to be God manifested in
[2:07:41] flesh today
[2:07:42] that's what we're supposed to be
[2:07:45] we've got to get all of ourself out of
[2:07:47] the way so he can come and be manifested
[2:07:49] through us he was The Giver of Life
[2:07:52] Jesus was the he was the creator of life
[2:07:57] and they couldn't see it right
[2:07:59] they couldn't see it
[2:08:01] you know go you go back and you look at
[2:08:03] um at Mary and Martha uh as I read
[2:08:06] through the scriptures on
[2:08:07] I noticed you know in in news broadcast
[2:08:11] um today you can turn on radios and you
[2:08:14] can hear different news broadcasts you
[2:08:15] could go from Station to Station and you
[2:08:18] you hear things and it seems like
[2:08:19] they've all been given the same talking
[2:08:22] point you know because no matter where
[2:08:24] you turn to you look to it's like every
[2:08:27] one of them saying the same negative
[2:08:28] thing and they're all you know every but
[2:08:31] it's always matching most of the time
[2:08:32] you're like but did they somebody just
[2:08:34] issue something out that says all right
[2:08:36] everybody talk about this today because
[2:08:38] it seems that way
[2:08:40] but as I was looking through the
[2:08:41] Scripture it seemed like both Mary Mary
[2:08:44] and Martha had the same talking point
[2:08:48] you go back and you look at it they
[2:08:51] um they would come to him and they you
[2:08:53] know different times they would come to
[2:08:54] Jesus and they said Lord
[2:08:56] you know
[2:08:57] if you'd just been here
[2:09:00] Lazarus wouldn't be dead right
[2:09:02] you know Martha says that one time
[2:09:04] can you go find another place Mary says
[2:09:07] that to him
[2:09:08] they both had already been talking about
[2:09:09] it together and they both agreed you
[2:09:12] know what if he'd just been here right
[2:09:14] we wouldn't be dealing with this right
[2:09:16] now
[2:09:16] if he'd just if he'd just come when we
[2:09:19] asked him to come
[2:09:20] why didn't he come you know but he had a
[2:09:23] purpose for that you know their uh their
[2:09:26] way of looking at it to me the way I
[2:09:29] perceive it is
[2:09:30] they were they in effect they were
[2:09:32] telling Jesus
[2:09:34] I could have believed for his healing
[2:09:38] on this side of the Stone
[2:09:42] but now he's placed in a place that I
[2:09:46] can't see him no more
[2:09:48] he's behind a stone and I can't see him
[2:09:51] so therefore I can't believe for his
[2:09:54] healing now
[2:09:55] because he's beyond my vision that's
[2:09:59] right they were trying to put limits on
[2:10:00] him
[2:10:02] it was beyond their vision
[2:10:05] they could not see Lazarus being healed
[2:10:09] from behind that stone exactly because
[2:10:12] there was a stone and I didn't even tell
[2:10:14] you what I want to talk about this
[2:10:15] morning rolling away the stone of doubt
[2:10:20] we've got to get the stone of Doubt out
[2:10:25] got to get it out of my way
[2:10:28] but but see they they talk to him and
[2:10:30] they're like Lord you know
[2:10:31] if you'd have been here
[2:10:34] you could have done something
[2:10:36] when he was on this side of the Stone
[2:10:40] but now
[2:10:41] he's in a place
[2:10:44] that we can't see him no more
[2:10:47] and evidently since we can't see him no
[2:10:49] more you can't see him either
[2:10:52] and Jesus says hang on a second
[2:10:56] hang on a second
[2:10:58] just because you can't see
[2:11:02] beyond that stone of doubt
[2:11:04] because that's what it was it rolled a
[2:11:07] stone of doubt in front of them and all
[2:11:10] they stood there and looked at
[2:11:12] was that stone
[2:11:15] they couldn't see what was behind the
[2:11:16] stone
[2:11:18] all they saw in their life
[2:11:20] was a stone
[2:11:23] and Jesus said y'all
[2:11:26] he's just sleeping back there
[2:11:28] if you could see through my eyes
[2:11:32] You Could See Beyond
[2:11:34] that wall of doubt that wall of worry
[2:11:38] that's standing in front of you because
[2:11:40] that's what they were they were full of
[2:11:42] doubt
[2:11:43] they were full of worry they were full
[2:11:46] of fears they were full of anxiety and
[2:11:49] all they could do was stand there and
[2:11:51] look at that stone
[2:11:53] and they would just sit there and look
[2:11:55] at it yeah oh
[2:11:57] if he was just on this side of the stone
[2:12:01] there was something he could do
[2:12:03] and Jesus said
[2:12:06] don't y'all know who I am
[2:12:10] I am the way
[2:12:12] I am the truth
[2:12:14] I am the life
[2:12:16] I made that stone
[2:12:19] I made that stone
[2:12:22] I can see through that stone was it
[2:12:25] Superman they're supposed to have these
[2:12:27] powers of of looking through different
[2:12:29] things like x-ray vision God's a whole
[2:12:31] lot better than Superman
[2:12:33] he sees right through all the fear he
[2:12:36] sees right through all the doubt all the
[2:12:38] things that you put up in front of you
[2:12:41] you put up all these things that blocks
[2:12:44] you from seeing what's on the other side
[2:12:45] and and Jesus says you know what listen
[2:12:49] would y'all go get that stone out the
[2:12:50] way yeah
[2:12:51] move it
[2:12:53] and they're like yeah but
[2:12:56] surely he stinks by now
[2:12:58] it's been four days
[2:13:00] it wouldn't have been four days if you'd
[2:13:02] just been here
[2:13:04] if you'd just done what we said
[2:13:06] you to come when we called you we
[2:13:08] wouldn't be having this conversation
[2:13:09] right now
[2:13:11] you know I think sometimes we look at
[2:13:13] the scripture and we we fail to really
[2:13:15] put it in perspective of of how I mean
[2:13:18] they had emotions like we have emotions
[2:13:21] I'm sure they kind of gave him a fit
[2:13:24] I'm sure whenever he when he finally
[2:13:25] showed up they're like whoa what what in
[2:13:28] the world happened to you
[2:13:30] you know we thought that you were
[2:13:31] friends
[2:13:33] you know and he's like I don't know what
[2:13:35] the big deal is
[2:13:37] you know I don't see what the big deal
[2:13:39] is he he did
[2:13:41] he's still living you know in his mind
[2:13:44] because he saw past
[2:13:47] he saw past the stone he saw past the
[2:13:50] grave
[2:13:51] the cave that he was stuck in
[2:13:54] Jesus didn't stick him in that cave
[2:13:57] he didn't put him in there
[2:13:59] so Jesus said hey
[2:14:01] y'all get him out
[2:14:04] y'all take him out of the cave
[2:14:05] and when he came out of the cave
[2:14:08] he was still bound
[2:14:11] it was still bound
[2:14:13] who loosed him
[2:14:15] nope
[2:14:18] yeah
[2:14:19] Jesus didn't loose him from the bondage
[2:14:22] that the people around him had placed
[2:14:24] him in
[2:14:26] those people had to go loose him
[2:14:28] they're the ones that bound him up tied
[2:14:31] him up in doubt and in fear
[2:14:35] he says I didn't tie him up in that
[2:14:37] doubt good I didn't put him behind that
[2:14:41] wall
[2:14:42] you go get him out
[2:14:45] open up the door allow him to come out
[2:14:48] and now you go loosen because you bound
[2:14:51] him up Jesus didn't bind them up
[2:14:54] Jesus hadn't bound you up
[2:14:56] but sometimes we allow the people that
[2:14:58] we get around to bind us up
[2:15:02] and we feel under bonded I can't move I
[2:15:04] can't you know I I can't do because I
[2:15:07] don't know what they're going to say
[2:15:09] oh if if I let go and I and I do
[2:15:12] something I don't know what they're
[2:15:14] going to say about me and you've allowed
[2:15:16] the people around you the circumstances
[2:15:19] so-called friends
[2:15:21] you've allowed so-called friends to come
[2:15:23] down and bind you up
[2:15:25] you got to break you got to break
[2:15:27] through that
[2:15:29] and if you think Hmm
[2:15:35] the scriptures say when you stand to
[2:15:38] pray
[2:15:40] forgive
[2:15:43] forgive
[2:15:48] there may be
[2:15:49] some forgiving that needs to go on
[2:15:53] you may not have realized
[2:15:56] that the The Grudges that you've held
[2:15:59] against somebody
[2:16:00] has put them in bondage
[2:16:03] you may not even realize that the things
[2:16:05] that you have said
[2:16:07] about somebody has placed them in
[2:16:10] bondage and all they need is for you to
[2:16:12] forgive them
[2:16:14] to release them from that bondage
[2:16:18] because God didn't bind them up like
[2:16:20] that
[2:16:23] and there may be some of that healing
[2:16:25] that needs to take place you know to you
[2:16:27] can release them release somebody from
[2:16:30] the bondage that you wrap them up in so
[2:16:32] they can serve him more
[2:16:36] Lord You're the one that's giving it to
[2:16:38] me that's not in my notes
[2:16:43] Jesus had a trouble of
[2:16:46] a struggle his his struggle that he
[2:16:49] fought was to try to get the people to
[2:16:52] believe
[2:16:55] you go you go through the scriptures
[2:16:57] look through it over and over the
[2:16:59] struggle that he had was trying his best
[2:17:02] to get the people to believe him for who
[2:17:07] he is
[2:17:09] you know what struggle brother Branham
[2:17:11] had
[2:17:13] trying to get people to believe yeah
[2:17:17] I believe the the angel told him that um
[2:17:20] you know if you can get the people to
[2:17:21] believe
[2:17:23] if you can get them to believe that
[2:17:25] nothing could stand before you right
[2:17:28] not even cancer
[2:17:30] it's the same struggle that Jesus had in
[2:17:32] his day is the same struggle that we
[2:17:35] have today is just simply getting people
[2:17:38] to believe
[2:17:40] that's all you got to do take him at his
[2:17:43] word and believe it that's what he Jesus
[2:17:45] said whosoever liveth and believeth in
[2:17:49] me
[2:17:50] shall never die
[2:17:52] believeth thou this
[2:17:54] yes see he was trying his best to get
[2:17:57] them to believe so Jesus Jesus finally
[2:17:59] he had to remove the doubt
[2:18:01] Before Their Eyes tells them to take
[2:18:03] away the stone
[2:18:04] because they were just going to sit
[2:18:06] there and keep looking at it you know
[2:18:08] they weren't going to do anything about
[2:18:10] it they were just going to keep
[2:18:11] complaining
[2:18:12] he's going to sit there they were
[2:18:13] comfortable in complaining and too many
[2:18:16] people today get comfortable in
[2:18:17] complaining and not doing something
[2:18:20] about it and removing some stuff out of
[2:18:22] the way so Jesus can come and and do
[2:18:25] something in their life you know the the
[2:18:27] song that says to Mariah saying
[2:18:30] your cries have awoken the master yes
[2:18:35] so I wrote a little note down it says
[2:18:38] Jesus was invited to
[2:18:41] awake
[2:18:44] w-a-k-e he was invited to awake for
[2:18:47] Lazarus
[2:18:49] so he went
[2:18:50] to awake
[2:18:54] he was invited to
[2:18:56] a funeral service
[2:18:58] he was invited to sit there and mourn
[2:19:01] but he didn't go to mourn
[2:19:04] he didn't go to awake to sit there and
[2:19:07] mourn he went to awake to wake them up
[2:19:11] to let them realize who he was
[2:19:13] if we could if we could ever get to the
[2:19:16] place that we could die to ourselves
[2:19:18] that we could mortify our flesh
[2:19:21] and invite him to our funeral
[2:19:26] you get what I'm saying
[2:19:28] if we could kill this flesh
[2:19:31] get all of our thoughts all of our ideas
[2:19:34] out of the way and we could invite him
[2:19:36] to our wake
[2:19:39] that he could come and awaken us
[2:19:43] to who he is and what he wants done what
[2:19:46] he wants us to do
[2:19:48] just invite him have a funeral service
[2:19:51] this morning and invite him to your
[2:19:53] funeral and let him come and awaken you
[2:19:55] Anew there was a there was a time that
[2:19:57] the disciples had a need
[2:20:00] to wake up Jesus
[2:20:03] but the whole time
[2:20:05] he was trying to wake them up
[2:20:08] you know they thought we're going to
[2:20:10] perish
[2:20:11] if he keeps sleeping
[2:20:14] and in his mind
[2:20:15] he was trying to awaken them to who he
[2:20:18] was
[2:20:19] so he allowed things to happen
[2:20:21] for purposes to get them to a place that
[2:20:24] he could reveal one more time this is
[2:20:26] who I am this is what I can do will you
[2:20:29] trust me will you believe me will you
[2:20:32] will you move the doubt out
[2:20:35] get the stone of doubt that you've put
[2:20:37] in front of between me and you
[2:20:40] and the blessing that I have for you get
[2:20:43] that stone out of the way and then I can
[2:20:45] perform and I can do something The
[2:20:47] Awakening of Lazarus was not only for
[2:20:50] Lazarus but it was so the stone of Doubt
[2:20:53] of who Jesus truly was could be rolled
[2:20:56] away from the eyes of the people because
[2:21:00] they needed to be awakened they needed
[2:21:03] to wake up and recognize who he was I
[2:21:07] pray that God would help us
[2:21:09] I pray he helps us to realize wake up
[2:21:12] and realize who he is before it's too
[2:21:16] late because there will come a time that
[2:21:19] it's too late
[2:21:20] it's coming time I don't want there to
[2:21:23] be not an ounce not an ounce of doubt in
[2:21:27] my life he's done so much for me the
[2:21:30] song says he's done so much for me that
[2:21:33] I I cannot tell it all
[2:21:36] there's so many times in my life I've
[2:21:38] watched him come down and perform why
[2:21:40] would I want to doubt
[2:21:42] why do I ever want to doubt what he can
[2:21:45] do for me in in Luke chapter 24 verses
[2:21:49] 14 through 31.
[2:21:52] it says and they talk together of all
[2:21:54] these things which had happened
[2:21:57] and it came to pass that while they
[2:22:00] communed together and reasoned Jesus
[2:22:02] himself Drew near
[2:22:04] and went with them
[2:22:06] but their eyes were holding that they
[2:22:10] should not know him
[2:22:12] Their Eyes Were darkened their
[2:22:14] understanding they could not see who he
[2:22:16] was and he said unto them
[2:22:19] what y'all talking about
[2:22:22] what manner of communications are these
[2:22:26] that ye have one to another as you walk
[2:22:29] and are sad
[2:22:31] and the one of them whose name was
[2:22:34] cleopas answered and said unto him are
[2:22:37] thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and
[2:22:40] has not known the things which are come
[2:22:42] to pass there in these days
[2:22:45] and he said unto them
[2:22:47] he played dumb
[2:22:49] what things
[2:22:50] what are y'all talking about
[2:22:52] what things and they said unto him
[2:22:56] concerning Jesus of Nazareth
[2:23:00] which was a prophet
[2:23:02] Mighty see many of them that's all on
[2:23:04] all they knew him as
[2:23:07] that's all they knew him as which was a
[2:23:09] prophet Mighty indeed and word before
[2:23:11] God and all the people
[2:23:14] and how the chief priests and our rulers
[2:23:16] delivered him to be condemned to death
[2:23:19] and have crucified him
[2:23:21] but we trust him
[2:23:24] now the the thing about the way they
[2:23:27] trusted was they hoped for
[2:23:31] they didn't have a true faith
[2:23:33] it was just a hope for if you go back
[2:23:37] and you you read through that they they
[2:23:38] were hoping not really believing
[2:23:42] so but we trusted that it had been he
[2:23:45] which should have redeemed Israel
[2:23:48] and beside all this today
[2:23:51] is the third day since these things were
[2:23:54] done now why would they even bring up
[2:23:56] today's the third day if this guy
[2:23:58] they're talking to presumably doesn't
[2:24:00] even know what they're talking about
[2:24:03] I mean but they're they're getting into
[2:24:05] some details now and and I'm sure he's
[2:24:07] like all right come on preach on
[2:24:09] yeah preach on just keep keep preaching
[2:24:11] he says yay and certain women also of
[2:24:14] our company made us astonished which
[2:24:17] were early at the Supple curve and when
[2:24:20] they found not his body they came saying
[2:24:23] they came letting us know they came
[2:24:25] telling us that they had also seen a
[2:24:29] vision of angels which said that he was
[2:24:32] alive
[2:24:33] and certain of them
[2:24:35] which were with us went to the Sepulcher
[2:24:38] and found it even so as the women
[2:24:40] they're like
[2:24:43] not sure if I should believe them or not
[2:24:45] right I'm gonna go check it out for
[2:24:46] myself
[2:24:48] it's not a bad thing
[2:24:51] go see for yourself
[2:24:54] go see for yourself because somebody
[2:24:56] make mislead You Lead You Lead You Off
[2:24:59] The Path go see for yourself
[2:25:02] and found it even so as the women had
[2:25:05] said but him they saw not
[2:25:08] then he said unto them old fools
[2:25:11] and slow of heart to believe all that
[2:25:16] the prophets have spoken
[2:25:19] ought not Christ who have suffered these
[2:25:21] things and to enter into his glory in
[2:25:25] other words
[2:25:26] I really I I suffered all the things
[2:25:29] that I did I went through all the things
[2:25:31] that I had to do and you still don't
[2:25:33] believe
[2:25:35] I really had to do all that and you
[2:25:38] still don't believe me
[2:25:41] verse 27 and beginning at Moses and all
[2:25:44] the prophets he expounded unto them in
[2:25:47] all the scriptures the things concerning
[2:25:49] himself and they drew nigh unto the
[2:25:52] village whether they went and he made as
[2:25:54] though he would have gone further but
[2:25:56] they constrained him saying abide with
[2:25:58] us for it's towards evening and the day
[2:26:01] is far Spin and he went in to tarry with
[2:26:03] them and it came to pass as he said at
[2:26:06] the table with them he took bread
[2:26:09] and blessed it and break and gave to
[2:26:13] them
[2:26:15] and their eyes
[2:26:17] were opened
[2:26:20] that's when they knew him when he broke
[2:26:24] the bread and he blessed it and their
[2:26:27] eyes were open and they knew him
[2:26:30] and he vanished from their sight
[2:26:34] oh that our eyes would be open today
[2:26:38] that our eyes would be open today
[2:26:41] that as we would be here in this service
[2:26:43] and as the bread breaks is being broken
[2:26:45] forth before us and he comes down to sup
[2:26:48] with us and to that we would recognize
[2:26:51] who he is this morning and no longer be
[2:26:55] constrained by doubt
[2:26:57] no longer be constrained by worry you
[2:27:01] know
[2:27:03] this ain't my notes but it just comes to
[2:27:04] me
[2:27:06] you know sometimes the things that that
[2:27:08] we will allow to worry us
[2:27:12] will be things that a doctor will tell
[2:27:14] you
[2:27:16] now we go to doctors and we trust
[2:27:20] that the Lord will lead them and guide
[2:27:22] them through the information to the
[2:27:24] knowledge that they have to the best of
[2:27:26] their abilities but my hope and my faith
[2:27:29] doesn't does not lie within a doctor and
[2:27:33] within a doctor's report
[2:27:35] because I can tell you that those doctor
[2:27:38] reports can be wrong
[2:27:40] and I've got proof of that sitting right
[2:27:43] back well sitting over here
[2:27:46] he's here in the house
[2:27:48] and he's here in the house too
[2:27:52] the one who brought that to pass is here
[2:27:54] this morning
[2:27:55] but see you'll listen to a doctor you'll
[2:27:58] go in and a doctoral they'll all you
[2:28:00] know what a doctor can do all they can
[2:28:02] do is tell you what they can see
[2:28:05] now they'll they'll check your weight
[2:28:07] they'll check your blood pressure
[2:28:08] they'll check all these different things
[2:28:10] and they document it on filing they keep
[2:28:13] it on file and the next time you go they
[2:28:15] want to check you again and they compare
[2:28:18] it against your last
[2:28:20] and each time you go and they go and
[2:28:22] they go and you know they they go and
[2:28:23] they check all these things but all
[2:28:25] they're doing they are trying to Define
[2:28:27] you
[2:28:29] by what they can see
[2:28:32] they will Define Who You Are
[2:28:34] by what they see
[2:28:37] and don't don't have x-rays done they'll
[2:28:39] do ultrasounds they'll do all these
[2:28:41] different things and and they will try
[2:28:42] to Define you as a person by the things
[2:28:45] that they can see by all these different
[2:28:48] measurements that they can check you
[2:28:50] know
[2:28:51] but that's not how God defines you
[2:28:54] we're defined by what we can't see
[2:28:57] we're supposed to look beyond the
[2:28:59] physical look Beyond what's right in
[2:29:02] front of us look beyond the Unseen and
[2:29:06] claim those things that are not seen as
[2:29:09] though they are
[2:29:11] now the doctor will tell you that you're
[2:29:13] crazy
[2:29:14] they'll say now that we we heard we've
[2:29:17] we heard this between Heather and I
[2:29:19] throughout the years now you know the
[2:29:22] doctors this is what we see this and
[2:29:24] this is uh this is what's bad for you
[2:29:27] this is what's bad for him and and this
[2:29:29] things it just won't work and you know
[2:29:31] you really shouldn't get your hopes up
[2:29:34] um
[2:29:35] I don't want to be around some Negative
[2:29:38] Nancy that's telling me don't get my
[2:29:40] hopes up
[2:29:43] start telling me don't get my hopes up
[2:29:45] I'm going to stop listening to you right
[2:29:48] quick
[2:29:49] because I serve a God that's beyond hope
[2:29:53] I serve a god
[2:29:56] of Miracles
[2:29:58] I serve a God who is faithful to the
[2:30:00] things he's promised and just because a
[2:30:03] doctor will tell you you know from what
[2:30:05] I can see and that's when you stop him
[2:30:07] and you say I don't care what you can
[2:30:10] see because I'm looking at things that's
[2:30:12] far beyond what you can see I'm looking
[2:30:15] at things that he has told me I'm
[2:30:19] looking at things that he has shown me
[2:30:21] through a vision or through a through a
[2:30:24] a word of of the Lord that comes through
[2:30:27] somebody and speaks something to you
[2:30:29] don't don't book everything and Bank
[2:30:32] everything just because a doctor says
[2:30:34] that this is what it's going to be you
[2:30:36] can throw that in the trash
[2:30:38] I don't have no time for it if it's
[2:30:41] contrary to what my God has told me if
[2:30:43] it's contrary to what his promise has
[2:30:45] given to me I don't have the time to
[2:30:48] listen to it
[2:30:50] because all that's going to do when they
[2:30:52] say oh don't get your hopes up no we're
[2:30:54] supposed to come expecting
[2:30:56] we're supposed to come with an
[2:30:58] expectation of the miraculous to show up
[2:31:01] and have have his way this morning
[2:31:04] if you if you show up with the attitude
[2:31:06] of what I'm not getting my hopes up then
[2:31:08] why did you walk through those doors
[2:31:10] why did you wake up this morning
[2:31:13] if you're not going to have an
[2:31:14] expectation of what God can do
[2:31:17] I may not be able to see it
[2:31:20] but he's told me
[2:31:23] and I will trust what he told me over
[2:31:26] what I can see every day
[2:31:30] I'll say that again
[2:31:32] I will trust what he has said about me
[2:31:37] more than I trust what I know about me
[2:31:41] because the only thing that I know about
[2:31:43] me is what this flesh tells me about me
[2:31:47] but he said otherwise
[2:31:49] his word says I can have the things that
[2:31:54] I've asked for
[2:31:55] he will give me the desires of my heart
[2:31:58] if my motive my objective is correct and
[2:32:01] I'm in line with his word and I'm not
[2:32:03] out of line with his word and I go to
[2:32:05] him with a need
[2:32:07] he's going to fulfill it it's already
[2:32:09] been fulfilled don't let doubt stand in
[2:32:12] your way get the wall of Doubt get the
[2:32:15] wall of worry out of the way let don't
[2:32:18] don't be standing there on this side of
[2:32:20] the Grave looking at and say well I
[2:32:22] don't know what he can do because I
[2:32:24] can't see what's on the other side
[2:32:26] he has already seen what's on the other
[2:32:29] side
[2:32:30] believe him and walk toward it
[2:32:33] I don't know if who it was that made a
[2:32:35] comment about if there wasn't a you know
[2:32:38] if if the Lord told me to walk through
[2:32:39] that wall and I don't see a door I'm
[2:32:42] gonna believe that as I walk toward that
[2:32:44] wall and I get there he will make a door
[2:32:47] for me if he has asked me to do that he
[2:32:51] is powerful enough to make a door for me
[2:32:53] to walk through where there is no door
[2:32:56] because he is the door
[2:32:58] and if you will walk toward him he can
[2:33:01] open up no matter what it is no matter
[2:33:04] what you have need of you walk toward
[2:33:06] him and he will open it up before you
[2:33:09] this morning oh that our eyes would be
[2:33:12] open today we we just be we become so
[2:33:15] thick-headed sometimes like the
[2:33:16] disciples were you know and they were as
[2:33:18] he called him they were slow of heart to
[2:33:20] believe
[2:33:21] they saw a miracle after Miracle after
[2:33:24] Miracle after miracle and they were
[2:33:27] still unable to fully grasp fully
[2:33:30] understand and fully trust him for who
[2:33:34] he was I this morning I want the Holy
[2:33:37] Spirit just to roll away the stone of
[2:33:39] doubt in my life
[2:33:40] no matter what it is I want it rolled
[2:33:43] away from my life our spiritual eyes
[2:33:46] they get clouded up
[2:33:48] they get clouded up by doubt
[2:33:51] they get clouded up by worry
[2:33:53] you know and that's all it kind of just
[2:33:56] blinds us because that's what's right in
[2:33:58] front of us
[2:33:59] you know the the delay is we talked
[2:34:01] about it you know oh it's been it's been
[2:34:04] two years since I asked the Lord for for
[2:34:06] this to happen it's been three years
[2:34:08] it's been four years
[2:34:11] doesn't matter
[2:34:13] he is not delineated by time
[2:34:17] he's he's not constrained it's what
[2:34:19] delineated if you don't know that term
[2:34:21] but he is not constrained by time we're
[2:34:25] creatures of time
[2:34:26] he is not
[2:34:28] don't bind him up just because you
[2:34:31] haven't seen something happen in five
[2:34:33] years or you haven't seen something
[2:34:35] happen in five months and you've been
[2:34:37] praying about it and you've been asking
[2:34:38] the Lord for a specific thing don't let
[2:34:41] that delay become a stone in front of
[2:34:45] you that's blocking you just because
[2:34:47] that's there doesn't mean that there's
[2:34:49] not Joy waiting on the other side of it
[2:34:51] because there is and if you can ever get
[2:34:54] it moved out of the way and see what he
[2:34:57] sees through his eyes he don't want you
[2:34:59] to look through your eyes this morning
[2:35:01] he wants you to look through his eyes
[2:35:03] and see what he is seeing he sees
[2:35:06] Victory he sees Freedom he sees Liberty
[2:35:09] he doesn't see fear
[2:35:12] he says I ain't giving that to you
[2:35:15] I ain't done it I did not give you fear
[2:35:18] in the message if God be with us and
[2:35:20] another spot there uh then where all the
[2:35:22] Miracles brother around says take the
[2:35:24] clouds away
[2:35:25] then what happens the sun is right there
[2:35:28] the only thing you have to do today is
[2:35:31] not oh Jesus come and heal me oh Jesus
[2:35:35] give me the Holy Ghost just take the
[2:35:38] clouds away he's already there
[2:35:42] he is already there he come 1900 years
[2:35:46] ago and he is still there he'll always
[2:35:49] be there
[2:35:51] I don't know if you know what the
[2:35:53] definition of
[2:35:54] um of Doubt is
[2:35:57] the definition of doubt
[2:36:00] one of the definitions is the lack of
[2:36:03] assurance
[2:36:06] doubt is the lack of assurance
[2:36:11] Assurance is confidence
[2:36:13] or certainty right that's what Assurance
[2:36:16] is
[2:36:17] Thomas who was one of the twelve he had
[2:36:20] a doubt problem
[2:36:20] [Music]
[2:36:22] we referred to him as doubting Thomas
[2:36:25] he wasn't with the others when Jesus
[2:36:27] first appeared to them after the
[2:36:28] resurrection you know
[2:36:30] so he had trouble believing what they
[2:36:33] were telling him right
[2:36:34] and his comment to them was
[2:36:37] unless I see in his hands the prince of
[2:36:40] the nails and put my finger into the
[2:36:43] print of the nails thrust my hand into
[2:36:44] his side
[2:36:46] I ain't gonna believe it
[2:36:48] it was a doubt in Thomas he says I got
[2:36:51] to see it for myself
[2:36:53] it's not a bad thing I want to see it
[2:36:55] for myself but there's times that you
[2:36:58] just got to believe because it was said
[2:36:59] sometimes you may not see it right then
[2:37:02] you've got to believe it
[2:37:04] Jesus said unto Thomas he said Thomas
[2:37:07] because thou has seen me thou Hast
[2:37:09] believed
[2:37:11] that he says blessed
[2:37:13] are they that have not seen
[2:37:16] and yet have believed
[2:37:19] you know it's good Thomas I'm glad that
[2:37:21] you got to see me in this way so that it
[2:37:24] helps you to believe but it's even more
[2:37:26] blessed
[2:37:28] even more blessed are those that haven't
[2:37:31] seen
[2:37:32] but yet they still believe
[2:37:34] the the only reason that doubt can be
[2:37:36] present is simply due to the absence of
[2:37:39] the presence of God
[2:37:41] the absence of the presence of God
[2:37:44] introduces doubt
[2:37:47] for wherever God is there is assurance
[2:37:51] wherever God is there is certainty there
[2:37:55] is confidence
[2:37:56] there is a promise wherever wherever he
[2:37:59] is he is both the promised Giver
[2:38:03] and the promised keeper
[2:38:05] he himself
[2:38:07] is the manifestation of the promise
[2:38:12] he himself is the manifestation of the
[2:38:16] promise when we misplace our confidence
[2:38:19] and place it in our own abilities
[2:38:22] our own thoughts our own understanding
[2:38:26] it shuts the door to Faith
[2:38:29] and traps us within a tomb of doubt
[2:38:34] I'm gonna I'm gonna share that with you
[2:38:36] again when we misplace our confidence
[2:38:40] and we place it in our own abilities
[2:38:42] our own thoughts our own understanding
[2:38:46] it shuts the door to Faith and traps us
[2:38:49] inside a tomb of doubt
[2:38:52] but there's one present here this
[2:38:53] morning
[2:38:54] there's one here this morning that can
[2:38:57] roll that stone away
[2:38:59] that can call you out of that tomb
[2:39:02] Proverbs 3 and 5 says trust in the Lord
[2:39:05] with part of your heart
[2:39:10] trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[2:39:15] and lean not unto thine own
[2:39:19] understanding
[2:39:21] you know
[2:39:23] many times we stand in uh
[2:39:26] we stand in front of a door that that
[2:39:28] leads us to a place maybe that we've
[2:39:30] never been before
[2:39:31] I was um I was at work
[2:39:34] um
[2:39:36] it's been a few weeks back and and um
[2:39:41] it's not often that the the Lord
[2:39:43] um speaks to me through uh
[2:39:46] um I would call it like a day Vision
[2:39:49] um but there are times I've been in my
[2:39:51] truck before and just be going down
[2:39:53] going down the road or stop at a red
[2:39:55] light and all of a sudden you know the
[2:39:56] Lord just shows something right in front
[2:39:59] of my eyes I mean it's just as clear as
[2:40:00] as anything else around me and I just
[2:40:03] have to I have to stop because I can
[2:40:05] tell that he's showing me something I
[2:40:07] was walking through
[2:40:09] our uh our shop a few weeks ago
[2:40:13] and as I was walking through it was it
[2:40:16] was as though a vision opened up in in
[2:40:18] front of me brother Steve and um
[2:40:21] it was as though I was watching a person
[2:40:23] standing at a door
[2:40:26] and they were debating within themselves
[2:40:29] whether they should go through that door
[2:40:33] that's all I could see I could I could
[2:40:34] see an individual it it never was clear
[2:40:38] enough for me to see who it was but
[2:40:40] there was an individual standing at a
[2:40:42] door
[2:40:43] and they were communicating back and
[2:40:46] forth with within themselves should I
[2:40:48] open the door
[2:40:49] or should I stay on this side of the
[2:40:51] door on this side of the door
[2:40:53] I can see what's around me
[2:40:56] and I know what's happening here
[2:40:59] but they were compelled to go through
[2:41:01] the door but there was fear to take a
[2:41:04] hold of the the doorknob and open the
[2:41:06] door and cross into the other side and
[2:41:09] in this Vision because that what there
[2:41:11] was a turmoil going on in their mind was
[2:41:14] I don't know exactly what's on the other
[2:41:17] side of that door
[2:41:20] but then as as a vision kept unfolding
[2:41:23] I'm walk literally walking through the
[2:41:25] shop and this is just just just showing
[2:41:27] it in in my mind and and then I hear a
[2:41:29] voice
[2:41:30] that says trust me
[2:41:33] trust me the voice was from the other
[2:41:36] side of the door now there was one voice
[2:41:39] on this side of the door saying stay
[2:41:41] where you at
[2:41:43] stay where you're at you're comfortable
[2:41:44] where you're at stay here
[2:41:47] you don't know what's on the other side
[2:41:48] but then I could hear another voice on
[2:41:51] the other side of the voice saying just
[2:41:53] trust me
[2:41:54] just trust me for where I am you will
[2:41:57] want to be
[2:41:59] and then I then I broke you know it
[2:42:01] broke out of my mind and I was like
[2:42:03] that's that's so that's so real to me
[2:42:06] it's how it's how it is so many times
[2:42:07] because we come to a place in our life
[2:42:09] and and and you're thinking you know
[2:42:12] Satan would would be happy with you
[2:42:14] becoming lackadaisical yeah
[2:42:16] yeah he would be happy with you just
[2:42:18] being complacent where you are right now
[2:42:22] and not moving further he'd be glad for
[2:42:25] you to bow down to that altar of
[2:42:27] complacency and say you know it's it's
[2:42:30] all right it's all right everything's
[2:42:32] just fine I'm at peace where I'm at
[2:42:34] right now but the Lord is calling you
[2:42:36] further
[2:42:37] and there's a door that stands between
[2:42:39] you and him and he's just saying if you
[2:42:42] would just open that door
[2:42:44] there's a voice on the other side now
[2:42:47] that doors mostly closed that one's
[2:42:50] closed
[2:42:51] now I don't know maybe all of you have
[2:42:54] have been behind that door
[2:42:57] maybe maybe there's some that's never
[2:42:59] been behind that door
[2:43:02] now I could I could sit here and I could
[2:43:04] expound to you because I've been behind
[2:43:08] that door I could tell you of things
[2:43:10] that I've seen inside that room
[2:43:14] because I have been there
[2:43:16] and maybe you've never stepped inside
[2:43:19] that door and you I could sit there and
[2:43:22] tell you different things that I've seen
[2:43:23] it out there's a desk in there
[2:43:25] there's a chair in there
[2:43:27] there's a couple other little wooden
[2:43:29] chairs in there there's different
[2:43:31] pictures that's that's posted that's on
[2:43:34] the on the Shelf in there I can I could
[2:43:35] I could expound these things to you and
[2:43:38] try to to tell you what's in there
[2:43:41] from this place that I'm standing right
[2:43:43] here because I've been there right
[2:43:46] now if I was to go over and walk through
[2:43:48] that door
[2:43:49] and stand inside that room
[2:43:52] I could be even more in detail
[2:43:55] of telling you what's on that side of
[2:43:57] the door
[2:43:58] we've had one that crossed over
[2:44:02] went beyond the Veil
[2:44:04] and that told us of things that were to
[2:44:07] come things that's on the other side and
[2:44:09] we are to trust in that voice we're to
[2:44:12] trust in that voice but see there's many
[2:44:14] people that have a fear of that
[2:44:16] did you did you know that there's people
[2:44:18] that actually have a fear
[2:44:20] of a door
[2:44:22] there's there's there's actual fear it's
[2:44:24] into phobia
[2:44:26] into phobia is a fear of doors
[2:44:29] because they walk up to a door and they
[2:44:32] they don't know there's people that
[2:44:34] literally have that fear it's a phobia
[2:44:36] that they they're they're not sure
[2:44:38] should I open the door or should I stay
[2:44:41] on this side of the door
[2:44:42] and I'm like
[2:44:44] you got to go through doors everywhere
[2:44:45] you go I would hate to have have that
[2:44:47] fear but there are people with a fear of
[2:44:51] into phobia
[2:44:52] and they will stand at the door not
[2:44:55] knowing should they go through should
[2:44:57] they stay here
[2:44:58] we don't need to stop and just stand at
[2:45:00] the door we need to open the door he is
[2:45:03] the door Christ is the door
[2:45:07] open that and walk through be a part of
[2:45:10] it if people also they suffer from um
[2:45:14] decidophobia
[2:45:17] I did I did a study a while back looking
[2:45:20] at different phobias and there's
[2:45:23] um I came across it was like over 400
[2:45:26] different
[2:45:28] phobias that are listed desidophobia I
[2:45:32] don't know if you've ever heard that
[2:45:33] word before
[2:45:35] but many times especially on Sunday
[2:45:37] afternoons
[2:45:39] um that's something that many people
[2:45:41] suffer with decidophobia it's the fear
[2:45:44] of making a decision
[2:45:46] where are we going to go eat
[2:45:52] I'm telling you it happens in our home
[2:45:55] decidophobia
[2:45:57] where are we going to eat I don't know
[2:45:59] whatever sounds good to you
[2:46:01] I don't know whatever sounds good to you
[2:46:03] it just goes back and forth you know and
[2:46:06] people suffer from decidophobia another
[2:46:08] another term for decidophobia is
[2:46:10] decision paralysis
[2:46:13] this is a this is a legitimate phobia
[2:46:16] that people have and it will cause them
[2:46:18] to freeze up and they cannot make a
[2:46:21] decision about something
[2:46:25] in First Kings
[2:46:26] chapter 18 and 21.
[2:46:29] says and Elijah came unto all the people
[2:46:32] and said how long halt ye between two
[2:46:37] opinions
[2:46:40] they were suffering from decidophobia
[2:46:44] they were suffering from a decision
[2:46:46] paralysis if the Lord be God follow him
[2:46:51] but if Baal then follow him and the
[2:46:55] people answered him not a word they were
[2:46:58] still stuck
[2:47:01] in decidophobia they could not make a
[2:47:04] decision they were afraid they were
[2:47:06] going to make the wrong decision they
[2:47:08] were they were afraid there's a there's
[2:47:10] a
[2:47:14] f-o-m-o
[2:47:16] fear of
[2:47:18] missing out
[2:47:19] somebody said it fear of missing out
[2:47:21] another one is
[2:47:22] um f-o-b-o
[2:47:24] fear of better offer
[2:47:29] Ed
[2:47:30] do you know some that have the fear of a
[2:47:32] better offer
[2:47:34] yeah there ain't no better offer than
[2:47:36] what we have in Christ
[2:47:38] ain't no better offer
[2:47:40] but yeah there's some that suffer
[2:47:43] um that decidophobia and the uh phobo
[2:47:45] kind of go hand in hand because they
[2:47:48] can't make a decision because they're
[2:47:50] afraid
[2:47:51] that there's going to be something
[2:47:52] better at the next door
[2:47:55] and if I buy this then I don't have the
[2:47:57] money to buy that so I don't know if I
[2:47:58] should if I shouldn't
[2:48:00] I'll just get on both
[2:48:03] and then I'll take them home and I'll
[2:48:04] decide and I can always take something
[2:48:06] back
[2:48:07] always take something back because
[2:48:09] target takes it back
[2:48:18] here's um
[2:48:19] doubt
[2:48:21] becomes
[2:48:23] very evident
[2:48:26] that it's present among people
[2:48:28] that fear of making a decision doubting
[2:48:31] is wavering an opinion that's what
[2:48:33] doubting is doubt is synonymous with
[2:48:35] worry it's worries synonymous with fear
[2:48:39] so
[2:48:41] many today there's a stone of worry
[2:48:43] there's a stone of fear there's a stone
[2:48:45] of doubt that's blocking their path to
[2:48:47] Jesus
[2:48:49] there's some people that suffer with
[2:48:51] called xenophobia xenophobia is the fear
[2:48:54] of the unknown
[2:48:56] it causes great anxiety for some because
[2:48:58] in their own thinking here again in
[2:49:01] their own thinking
[2:49:03] their own understanding the
[2:49:05] circumstances appear uncertain
[2:49:08] the outcome is unknown
[2:49:11] this is people that deal with xenophobia
[2:49:14] there's many people
[2:49:16] spiritually deal with xenophobia they
[2:49:20] sit and dwell within their own thoughts
[2:49:21] and try to figure it all out when Christ
[2:49:24] says cast all your cares upon me
[2:49:30] just give it all over to me don't worry
[2:49:32] about it no more
[2:49:34] don't sit there and try to figure it all
[2:49:36] out
[2:49:37] just trust me believe me
[2:49:40] follow me that's all he wants you to do
[2:49:43] he says cast all your cares upon me they
[2:49:46] they claim people will claim to believe
[2:49:48] that
[2:49:49] they came to believe that scripture but
[2:49:52] do they really because their actions
[2:49:54] show different
[2:49:56] their actions don't prove that they
[2:49:58] really believe what he said to do when
[2:50:01] you try to tell them
[2:50:04] just give it to God
[2:50:07] have faith
[2:50:09] I've said that to people before just
[2:50:12] just give it to him trust him have faith
[2:50:16] you know what um many times you'll get
[2:50:19] this response
[2:50:21] you just don't understand my situation
[2:50:26] you don't understand what I'm going
[2:50:28] through brother Steve
[2:50:30] you just don't understand and if you
[2:50:33] understood you would care
[2:50:36] if you could understand where I'm at you
[2:50:39] would care
[2:50:41] you're just acting like you don't care
[2:50:43] it's just you're just brushing it off oh
[2:50:44] just give it into the hands of the Lord
[2:50:46] just give it in the hands of the Lord
[2:50:48] that's just a talking point brother
[2:50:50] Steve that's just you're just you're
[2:50:51] just saying that saying that because
[2:50:53] that way out you don't have to talk to
[2:50:55] me no more
[2:50:56] you don't have to listen to my problems
[2:50:58] no more you really don't understand and
[2:51:01] you really don't care
[2:51:04] now I'm just using that example I'm sure
[2:51:06] that's never happened
[2:51:07] with anybody here and brother Steve's
[2:51:10] never heard that before so
[2:51:12] that's happened before with me at our
[2:51:15] church and stuff like that
[2:51:17] um
[2:51:18] how can you be so unconcerned
[2:51:21] it is it is
[2:51:26] how can you be so unconcerned
[2:51:30] do you not understand the trouble I'm
[2:51:32] going through
[2:51:33] yeah I do
[2:51:35] I do and I am really concerned about you
[2:51:39] I'm concerned enough to tell you that
[2:51:42] the only one that can take care of it
[2:51:45] there's only one that can take care of
[2:51:47] it and it ain't me
[2:51:50] it's not your pastor
[2:51:52] the only one that can take care of it is
[2:51:55] Jesus Christ himself
[2:51:57] he's the only one
[2:51:59] so yes he is concerned he's concerned
[2:52:03] enough to point you in the right
[2:52:05] direction
[2:52:06] but you can sit and listen to Somebody's
[2:52:08] problems all day long and that ain't
[2:52:11] gonna do a bit of good for nobody
[2:52:15] but if you can ever leave it at his feet
[2:52:19] and really leave it there
[2:52:22] don't go back and pick it back up again
[2:52:26] that's the problem with so many people
[2:52:27] today and you know he said it's supposed
[2:52:28] to cast all your cares on him lay aside
[2:52:33] every weight
[2:52:36] don't go back and pick it up
[2:52:38] but too often we do
[2:52:40] as as as as humans we we do we're like
[2:52:43] you know
[2:52:45] I wouldn't talk to the pastor today
[2:52:49] he just didn't seem concerned at all
[2:52:52] he just said give it over to God he
[2:52:54] didn't even want to listen to me because
[2:52:56] he just to give it over to God I tried
[2:52:57] to give it over to God and I still have
[2:52:59] it with me it's because you didn't
[2:53:01] really give it over to him
[2:53:04] you picked it back up again
[2:53:06] so you could pet it
[2:53:08] this is my worry
[2:53:10] this is my worry this is this is my
[2:53:12] little pet and I'm going to keep it
[2:53:14] because this is something that I like to
[2:53:16] talk about and I like to tell everybody
[2:53:18] about this and and oh it's just it's
[2:53:21] such a it's such a horrible thing that
[2:53:23] I'm going through and it's such a and
[2:53:26] people just don't understand what I'm
[2:53:28] going through and all they do is just
[2:53:30] say give it over to God
[2:53:35] they're trying to really help you
[2:53:38] they're trying to really help you
[2:53:40] you got to give it to him
[2:53:43] you gotta leave it there take your
[2:53:45] burdens to the Lord and
[2:53:47] leave it there don't pick it back up
[2:53:50] again don't pet it
[2:53:53] brother Dan daisley used to talk about
[2:53:55] he you know if his feelings would get
[2:53:57] hurt and uh he said he said I would just
[2:54:00] I would he said I would nurse that my
[2:54:02] feelings got hurt it's my right to to
[2:54:06] they hurt my feelings
[2:54:09] I could I can remember playing his day
[2:54:10] he would stand there brother Stephen
[2:54:12] they said it was my feelings they hurt
[2:54:14] my feelings and he would just let that
[2:54:17] go on and go on and he this is he would
[2:54:19] Express this and he said finally you
[2:54:22] know you got to let that go
[2:54:24] you know you gotta you gotta get rid of
[2:54:26] that you can't just keep nursing that
[2:54:28] that heart you know the hard feelings
[2:54:30] that somebody had against you and you
[2:54:32] you come into church you come into
[2:54:34] church and you got a chip on your
[2:54:35] shoulder against somebody
[2:54:37] and you're thinking nobody else knows
[2:54:39] about it
[2:54:40] oh but they do
[2:54:43] because it changes the way you worship
[2:54:47] you got something against somebody
[2:54:50] it changes the way that you worship when
[2:54:53] you walk through those doors and you're
[2:54:55] thinking nobody else knows nothing about
[2:54:58] it
[2:54:59] I guarantee you they do it stands out
[2:55:02] like a neon sign people look at you like
[2:55:05] what is wrong with him
[2:55:07] what is wrong with them
[2:55:10] no so it you haven't got it hidden
[2:55:13] you might as well go take care of it
[2:55:15] before service starts get rid of it get
[2:55:19] that get that chip off your shoulder you
[2:55:21] know and let it go then you can come in
[2:55:25] and you can enter into his presence and
[2:55:28] the supernatural can happen because you
[2:55:30] are at freedom to worship
[2:55:33] Mercy Mercy Mercy
[2:55:36] we have to commit it to God and leave it
[2:55:38] there you've got to be persuaded in what
[2:55:41] God can do for you
[2:55:43] you must be persuaded in what he can do
[2:55:45] for you the world that we live in is
[2:55:47] full of fear it's full of doubt we get
[2:55:49] the word
[2:55:50] um our word phobia from the Greek word
[2:55:53] Phobos if I say that correctly which
[2:55:56] comes from the word and I don't know if
[2:55:58] I pronounced it right
[2:56:00] it's p-h-e-b-o-m-a-i
[2:56:04] okay
[2:56:05] well I was I was leaning on on brother
[2:56:08] Steve there I believe it's pronounced
[2:56:11] fibble mine
[2:56:13] people my means
[2:56:16] in quote to be put in fear
[2:56:22] to be put in fear that's where Phobos
[2:56:25] comes from bibomai we get our word
[2:56:28] phobia
[2:56:29] from Phobos
[2:56:31] so to me that calls into question
[2:56:34] by whom
[2:56:37] to be put in fear
[2:56:39] by whom
[2:56:41] if you're put into fear
[2:56:42] it's by someone
[2:56:44] and it ain't God
[2:56:46] I can tell you that
[2:56:48] I don't care what the situation is if
[2:56:51] you're dealing with fear
[2:56:53] it is not from him
[2:56:56] now fear as in reverence completely
[2:56:58] different word not not talking about
[2:57:00] that that's that's completely different
[2:57:02] there should be a reverence but fear in
[2:57:05] being afraid if you're dealing with fear
[2:57:08] that didn't come from him that didn't
[2:57:10] come from him you can go ahead and cast
[2:57:12] that out
[2:57:13] because he he says I I've not given you
[2:57:15] the spirit of fear
[2:57:17] so if he didn't give it to you
[2:57:19] who did
[2:57:21] where did it come from it come from the
[2:57:24] accuser of the brethren
[2:57:25] that's where it comes from that's where
[2:57:28] fear comes from it's so easy for us to
[2:57:31] listen to what Satan is trying to tell
[2:57:32] us these little little fears a little
[2:57:35] word of fear and we ignore what the word
[2:57:38] is trying to tell us
[2:57:41] I tell you this morning there is a cure
[2:57:44] for every fear that you could possibly
[2:57:46] have whether it's four of them
[2:57:50] or if you're dealing with all 400 of
[2:57:52] them I certainly pray that you're not
[2:57:54] because some of the ones that I read
[2:57:56] through was some crazy phobias that that
[2:57:58] people have
[2:58:00] but there is a cure and that cures Jesus
[2:58:03] that cure this morning is Jesus
[2:58:06] first John 4 18 says there is no fear
[2:58:10] Phobos
[2:58:12] there's no Phobos in love
[2:58:16] but perfect love casteth out
[2:58:20] all fear
[2:58:23] perfect love casteth out all fear
[2:58:28] this morning we have an empty grave
[2:58:31] that empty grave removes all doubt
[2:58:36] it removes every
[2:58:39] ounce of doubt that our Savior Lives
[2:58:43] I don't have to go and stand in front of
[2:58:45] a grave that has a stone and wonder
[2:58:49] is there something on the other side
[2:58:51] but we have an empty tomb and the empty
[2:58:54] tomb removes all doubt
[2:58:57] there is no doubt about it in my mind
[2:59:00] that My Savior Lives this morning the
[2:59:04] stone of doubt the stone of uncertainty
[2:59:06] that was there in front of them Jesus
[2:59:08] said they're not going to be able to do
[2:59:09] that
[2:59:11] they are not going to be able to remove
[2:59:13] that doubt
[2:59:16] so it wasn't a soldier that removed that
[2:59:20] stone
[2:59:21] it wasn't Mary and Martha that went and
[2:59:25] removed that stone
[2:59:27] that was hiding Jesus or hiding an empty
[2:59:30] tomb
[2:59:32] Jesus himself
[2:59:34] rolled that stone away
[2:59:37] it wasn't going to be by no man
[2:59:40] not any man here this morning that can
[2:59:42] take that that stone of Doubt away from
[2:59:45] your life but Jesus Christ himself has
[2:59:48] already done it
[2:59:50] he has already removed that stone stop
[2:59:53] looking at the cave stop looking at the
[2:59:56] grave he's not there no more
[2:59:59] he's not bound up and he doesn't want
[3:00:01] you to be bound up this morning either
[3:00:03] he wants you to be free the the stone
[3:00:06] was rolled away over 2 000 years ago
[3:00:10] and we have seen
[3:00:12] this morning
[3:00:14] the sunrise
[3:00:15] at s-o-n
[3:00:17] we have watched him rise once again
[3:00:21] and he he wants he wants to continue to
[3:00:23] rise he at my at my work I tell the guys
[3:00:26] all the time
[3:00:27] um I leave my office door open I have an
[3:00:29] open door policy you know it I'm if I'm
[3:00:32] in there and I'm working and they need
[3:00:34] to come talk to me my door's open you
[3:00:36] don't have to come and knock on the door
[3:00:37] just walk in and and talk to me I got
[3:00:40] like 20 employees and if you need to
[3:00:43] talk talk just just call me and open the
[3:00:45] door or or just walk through the door
[3:00:47] because I keep it open
[3:00:49] and I look I was thinking about that I
[3:00:50] was like he's got an open door policy to
[3:00:53] us this morning
[3:00:55] there's there's no stone there's no door
[3:00:58] standing in the way he says it's open
[3:01:01] you need anything from me this morning
[3:01:04] just come and partake
[3:01:06] come and partake come and see that I'm
[3:01:10] not there in the grave anymore I'm alive
[3:01:12] I'm well whatever you have need of I
[3:01:16] have removed all doubt because if the
[3:01:18] stone was still there today there would
[3:01:21] be doubt
[3:01:23] we we would have a reason to question
[3:01:25] whether or not he rose but the stone is
[3:01:28] gone
[3:01:29] I thought about earlier seeing maybe
[3:01:30] we'll sing it in in a minute if y'all
[3:01:32] y'all sing the song Gone the stone is
[3:01:34] rolled back well maybe we can maybe
[3:01:36] we'll sing that song
[3:01:38] um
[3:01:42] oh mama mama
[3:01:44] can I can I give you another
[3:01:46] um another word from from brother
[3:01:48] Brandon this morning y'all are such a
[3:01:50] lovely congregation to to preach to and
[3:01:53] and um and to to be with and and be
[3:01:56] worse in worship with and I don't want
[3:01:58] to take advantage of you this morning
[3:02:00] um but I tell you it's just things are
[3:02:03] the Lord just just comes and talks and
[3:02:05] and I want to just be a yielded vessel
[3:02:08] to let him let him speak but I don't
[3:02:09] want to labor you too long this morning
[3:02:13] um so so maybe let me uh if you don't
[3:02:16] mind let me read this um uh quote from
[3:02:18] Brother Randleman if you want to go
[3:02:20] ahead if the musicians want to come back
[3:02:22] that will be a cue to me to um that I
[3:02:25] can I can try to to wind down here this
[3:02:28] morning
[3:02:29] um and I don't think I don't know if I
[3:02:31] gave you this one sister charity
[3:02:34] um
[3:02:35] in 1965
[3:02:39] the message
[3:02:40] I guess it did
[3:02:42] well praise the Lord it is the rising of
[3:02:45] the Sun
[3:02:46] well good
[3:02:48] I don't have no I want to read it anyway
[3:02:50] I want to read it
[3:02:52] but there has got to come one
[3:02:56] there has come one
[3:02:57] there has got to come one Hallelujah
[3:03:01] there has to come a real bride
[3:03:05] there must come one that's not only got
[3:03:09] the mechanics
[3:03:10] many people got hung up with the
[3:03:12] mechanics years ago and that's all they
[3:03:14] wanted to stay with was just the
[3:03:16] mechanics
[3:03:17] not only got the mechanics but the
[3:03:20] Dynamics of it makes that church live
[3:03:24] move in the power of his resurrection
[3:03:27] until we come to that place
[3:03:30] until we find that place what good does
[3:03:34] it do to polish the hubs
[3:03:36] talking about your car what good does it
[3:03:39] do to give her a facelift or a simonized
[3:03:42] job now many
[3:03:43] younger people may not know what
[3:03:45] simonize is but so they wax it up
[3:03:48] there's simonized wax they would go out
[3:03:51] and polish up the the car when there's
[3:03:54] no dime what's what good does it do to
[3:03:56] give her a facelift or a simonized job
[3:03:58] when there's no Dynamics in it
[3:04:01] no matter how much the mechanics prove
[3:04:03] to be right there has got to be a
[3:04:06] Dynamics to make it work that's what he
[3:04:09] proved
[3:04:10] Hallelujah that's what Easter proved he
[3:04:15] wasn't only the word but he was God
[3:04:17] himself the Dynamics in the word that
[3:04:21] made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff
[3:04:24] and dead in the grave shaken to life and
[3:04:27] Rise Again it'll make you shake into
[3:04:29] life and rise again this morning too and
[3:04:32] roll away the stone it says I am he that
[3:04:36] was dead so dead till the son said he
[3:04:38] was dead the moon said he was dead the
[3:04:41] star said he was dead all nature said he
[3:04:44] was dead and now the whole world
[3:04:48] the whole world has to recognize
[3:04:52] that he's alive again
[3:04:54] I want them to recognize through my life
[3:04:57] that he is alive again
[3:05:00] he was not only the mechanics
[3:05:04] God's word
[3:05:05] he was
[3:05:07] the Dynamics to prove it
[3:05:11] he was not only the mechanics but he was
[3:05:14] the Dynamics to prove it and if you have
[3:05:18] Jesus Christ Living inside of you you're
[3:05:21] not going to be full just of mechanics
[3:05:23] but there is going to be power there's
[3:05:25] going to be a demonstration of the
[3:05:27] Dynamics of his life living through you
[3:05:31] this morning don't get hung up just on
[3:05:33] the mechanics let his life live through
[3:05:35] you to perform what he wants performed
[3:05:40] that's what he wants us to do we want he
[3:05:43] wants us to allow him to live his life
[3:05:46] through us get my life out of the way
[3:05:49] that there be a resurrection this
[3:05:51] morning of his life through mine living
[3:05:55] out what he wants to do through me and
[3:05:59] through you this morning Romans I got to
[3:06:02] say Romans 8 11. it says this y'all go
[3:06:05] ahead and stand
[3:06:06] don't go and stand
[3:06:10] he says
[3:06:11] the scripture reads but if
[3:06:15] the spirit of him now now you read
[3:06:19] there's a place that brother Branham was
[3:06:20] quoting this scripture in one of his
[3:06:22] message and brother round would say
[3:06:24] there is the problem there's his catch
[3:06:27] referring to the butt if he said there's
[3:06:30] his catch but if the spirit of him that
[3:06:34] raised up Jesus from the dead
[3:06:36] dwell in you
[3:06:39] dwell in me
[3:06:41] he that raised up Christ from the dead
[3:06:44] shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by
[3:06:50] his spirit that dwells in you the same
[3:06:54] power of the Resurrection that was in
[3:06:56] Christ Jesus dwells in us right now
[3:07:00] the same power that brought him out of
[3:07:03] the Grave dwells in me dwells in you
[3:07:06] right now to break through whatever
[3:07:08] Stone of Doubt is standing in your way
[3:07:10] whatever wall of worry that's sending in
[3:07:12] your way that same Christ Jesus dwells
[3:07:16] in me right now to Break Forth through
[3:07:19] that this morning there was there was a
[3:07:22] prayer that brother Branham prayed at
[3:07:24] the end of the service My Redeemer
[3:07:26] liveth and in that I want to close with
[3:07:28] with with uh letting you hear this he
[3:07:31] says may the people go away from here
[3:07:34] to remember this Easter forever
[3:07:37] granted Lord
[3:07:39] and may the great Powers may the great
[3:07:41] angels that rolled away the stone on
[3:07:44] Easter morning may they stand present
[3:07:47] today to roll away every stone of doubt
[3:07:51] every fear every Discord take it from
[3:07:56] the hearts of the people granted Lord
[3:07:59] that the Holy Spirit might come down in
[3:08:04] great power and have access to everyone
[3:08:08] granted
[3:08:10] through Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[3:08:14] and the church says
[3:08:16] amen
[3:08:19] that's what I want through my life this
[3:08:22] morning I want that same resurrection
[3:08:25] power to be present to roll away every
[3:08:28] stone of doubt
[3:08:29] every stone of worry every every stone
[3:08:33] of fear that Satan has placed in front
[3:08:35] of me that state that Satan has
[3:08:39] encouraged me to put in front of myself

[3:14:18] brother Branham brother Branham uses the
[3:14:20] Pagan word Easter
[3:14:21] and they keep saying it it's it's it's
[3:14:24] it's we use it as a day but he ever but

[3:15:37] brother Dwayne you know a lot of songs
[3:15:40] and singers and did you ever know the
[3:15:42] pains you ever remember hearing the
[3:15:44] pains
[3:15:45] uh he's still preaching and pastors of
[3:15:49] church I actually met him a couple of
[3:15:50] times but they sang a song that the
[3:15:53] conservative Pentecostals didn't quite
[3:15:55] know what to do with
[3:15:57] it says I'm a I'm a Jesus fan
[3:16:01] and they thought well that's a little
[3:16:03] you know but you know what people get
[3:16:06] excited I I could almost I used to could
[3:16:10] say the words by all the verses you know
[3:16:15] but I I can't quite get it I can't quite
[3:16:18] get the verses or I'd give you a little
[3:16:19] bit of the word I drove a little further
[3:16:22] and uh a crowd caught my my eye or
[3:16:26] something like that and
[3:16:28] they they were having a rock and roll
[3:16:31] party or something and he he said well I
[3:16:33] I they said man you're not with it
[3:16:37] we're just rock music fans
[3:16:40] listen to these words he said I was
[3:16:43] driving home one Friday when a commotion
[3:16:46] commotion caught my ear in a field a
[3:16:49] crowd was gathered I could hear them
[3:16:50] yell and cheer tell me why are you
[3:16:52] excited I ask a certain man he said
[3:16:55] there ain't no better reason I'm a
[3:16:57] football fan
[3:16:59] and I drove a little further and I saw
[3:17:01] another crowd they were dancing they
[3:17:03] were swaying I heard music playing loud
[3:17:06] I asked again why get excited I just
[3:17:09] don't understand someone said man you're
[3:17:11] not with it we're just rock music fans
[3:17:15] I went to church that Sunday and I heard
[3:17:17] the preacher say
[3:17:19] uh Jesus gave his life to save us and
[3:17:22] he's coming back someday I started
[3:17:24] getting happy
[3:17:26] how I shouted how I cried and then
[3:17:29] someone said don't get excited
[3:17:32] but this was my reply I'm a Jesus fan
[3:17:37] I'm a Jesus fan when I think about his
[3:17:41] Mercy I just got to lift my hands
[3:17:44] so if you hear me shouting you'll have
[3:17:47] to understand I can't help but get
[3:17:49] excited I'm a Jesus man whoa
[3:17:54] tell you what that's what I am this
[3:17:56] morning I'm a Jesus fan
[3:17:59] [Applause]
[3:18:01] oh Hallelujah I can't help but get a
[3:18:05] little bit excited
[3:18:07] captured my attention

[3:18:49] [Music]
[3:18:51] [Applause]
[3:18:53] preaching has been amazing and wonderful
[3:18:57] but that pre-service there before he
[3:19:00] started preaching singing
[3:19:02] It is Well when my soul and him holding
[3:19:05] that baby and I felt like I was living
[3:19:08] in the Bible this felt like I was caught
[3:19:11] up in something biblical
[3:19:14] you know that was what they said to one
[3:19:16] another in the in the beginnings of the
[3:19:19] latter rain Revival
[3:19:20] they began to go around to one another
[3:19:22] and they'd say Bible days are here again
[3:19:25] instead of saying God bless you brother
[3:19:28] it's good to see you they'd say Bible
[3:19:30] days are here again
[3:19:32] Bible days are here again brother random
[3:19:35] said if that vine ever puts forth
[3:19:37] another branch
[3:19:39] there'll be another book of Acts
[3:19:42] written after that I believe it it'll
[3:19:45] have to be exactly like the original one
[3:19:48] on the day of Pentecost and that'll give
[3:19:51] us reason to say we could say it now
[3:19:54] what we've seen God do and how he is
[3:19:57] delivered and moved we could say it
[3:19:59] without any doubt Bible days
[3:20:02] are here again oh I'm so glad they never
[3:20:06] left

[3:26:38] praise the Lord
[3:26:42] you folks can slip back to your seat
[3:26:44] thank you for coming to worship he is
[3:26:46] worthy
[3:26:47] We Believe of you as you have said under
[3:26:50] the word today God is Minister to your
[3:26:52] need
[3:26:53] you may leave this place and find out
[3:26:56] that he's healed you
[3:26:59] you may go home to bring your lunch and
[3:27:01] find out something some burden you were
[3:27:04] carrying when you came is no longer on
[3:27:06] your shoulder because Supernatural
[3:27:09] things happen in the presence of that
[3:27:12] Supernatural God and when his word was
[3:27:15] going forth today perhaps something took
[3:27:19] place in you in that moment you didn't
[3:27:21] even know what was happening how has
[3:27:23] anybody ever had that happen to them I
[3:27:25] have
[3:27:26] healed with no prayer nobody praying
[3:27:29] just get in the right atmosphere all
[3:27:32] wonderful things can happen I don't
[3:27:35] normally say this because he's my son
[3:27:39] and but I want to tell you as a pastor
[3:27:42] how thankful I am a dad I'm very very
[3:27:47] proud but as a pastor I want to tell you
[3:27:50] how thankful I am for a worship leader
[3:27:53] who works up a sweat
[3:27:56] I mean that
[3:27:58] I mean that
[3:28:03] it's not it's not in the sweat that's
[3:28:07] not what I'm talking about but I I've
[3:28:09] been so many times in churches that had
[3:28:13] uh
[3:28:15] brought me in
[3:28:17] to bring Revival
[3:28:21] and then they would put that six foot
[3:28:23] icicle
[3:28:25] in the Pulpit to lead the worship
[3:28:28] no atmosphere created at all
[3:28:32] not to mention that everything was so
[3:28:34] Antiquated nobody likes old hymns any
[3:28:38] more than I do I don't mind hymns but
[3:28:41] they ought to be sung with an anointing
[3:28:45] you ought to at least have somebody act
[3:28:47] like they have some slight knowledge of
[3:28:49] what they're singing about
[3:28:51] and uh when Benjamin started leading
[3:28:53] worship he he got carried away and
[3:28:56] from the beginning and some people
[3:28:58] didn't like it and and uh but but
[3:29:01] somehow he has survived it
[3:29:04] and I wanted to just say to him I don't
[3:29:07] often say it to him publicly or about
[3:29:09] him but I want to say how thankful I am
[3:29:12] that he can create an atmosphere as a
[3:29:16] preacher to to come up behind that is a
[3:29:20] great blessing and we do have the the
[3:29:23] best we have the best musicians we are
[3:29:28] so blessed
[3:29:29] sister Laurel Sister Mary Beth sister
[3:29:31] West when she's here and we have others
[3:29:34] that are coming along that are going to
[3:29:36] be able to do very well on the piano
[3:29:38] when it's the time for them to be there
[3:29:41] and we've got these brothers on the
[3:29:44] guitars and Zach on the drums and and
[3:29:47] we're just blessed
[3:29:49] we're just blessed we got cameraman some
[3:29:53] of them don't look like they're old
[3:29:54] enough to
[3:29:55] to run cameras but they do and they do
[3:29:57] it with a good good job they do a good
[3:30:00] job at it and they do it because
[3:30:02] sometimes volunteers are few and hard to
[3:30:05] come by but they're willing
[3:30:07] and uh why Joseph up there he can run
[3:30:10] the whole thing he can run the stream
[3:30:12] and he can do a lot of it and we're just
[3:30:15] blessed I don't want to call names
[3:30:17] sister Laurel is not only a great
[3:30:19] musician but she is also an amazing
[3:30:23] dessert maker
[3:30:26] and she has made all the desserts that
[3:30:30] you have enjoyed this weekend you know
[3:30:33] somebody says well I'll bring I'll bring
[3:30:35] a pie and she says well I'll bring a
[3:30:37] hundred pies
[3:30:40] and 100 cheesecakes while I'm at it you
[3:30:43] know and we appreciate that and so many
[3:30:46] have brought and and fed and guess what
[3:30:48] in just a few days we get to do this
[3:30:51] again because camp meeting starts
[3:30:54] October the 11th Tuesday Wednesday
[3:30:57] Thursday I know this wasn't the time to
[3:30:59] mention it was it when you're already so
[3:31:02] tired Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday
[3:31:05] Saturday
[3:31:07] and all day Sunday

[3:31:11] we're going to have a wonderful time in
[3:31:14] the presence of the Lord at tabernacle's
[3:31:16] time I believe God's going to minister
[3:31:19] and he's going to meet needs would you
[3:31:21] stand One Last Time on our 2022 youth
[3:31:26] weekend

[3:31:40] very much to the tent pictures the ones
[3:31:43] who put the tents up and ran the lights
[3:31:45] and it just goes on and on and on
[3:31:47] there's no way that one family or even
[3:31:51] two families could put everything
[3:31:52] together it takes a great number of
[3:31:55] people who are willing we're blessed to
[3:31:58] have workers and not not nearly as many
[3:32:01] grumblers as we have workers sometimes
[3:32:04] we Grumble while we're working but we
[3:32:06] get it done
[3:32:08] we get it done we're just so so blessed
[3:32:13] thank you brother Dwayne for coming and
[3:32:16] singing and preaching and blessing us so
[3:32:21] teaching us

[3:32:27] sister Heather is super mom we're just
[3:32:31] it it just takes a lot you know I I hear
[3:32:35] people often complaining about the
[3:32:37] smallest little thing with their babies
[3:32:39] or children and I think about you know
[3:32:42] you really really
[3:32:45] ought to think about what it's like to
[3:32:47] drag them across the country to carry
[3:32:50] the gospel
[3:32:51] you know my wife was a superhero and it
[3:32:55] wasn't easy but we went and we didn't
[3:32:58] just go up the road we crossed the
[3:33:00] Nations we crossed the Atlantic time and
[3:33:04] time again with nursing babies and no it
[3:33:07] wasn't easy but what else could we do
[3:33:11] what else could we do and I appreciate
[3:33:13] them coming knowing that that Liam is a
[3:33:17] newborn and you're in a hotel and you're
[3:33:19] off schedule and I appreciate that I
[3:33:23] appreciate that they can look as good as
[3:33:25] they do and put together as they do and
[3:33:28] smile as pretty as they do knowing that
[3:33:30] they've been up and down all night long
[3:33:33] you know we're blessed to be able not to
[3:33:36] have to wait they could have said oh in
[3:33:38] about 12 months when things are all
[3:33:40] settled down we'll come but I'm thankful
[3:33:43] that they didn't do that I'm thankful
[3:33:44] for you mamas that have made the effort
[3:33:47] and I saw many having to get their
[3:33:49] babies fed during the service or taking
[3:33:51] them out or uh whatever the things you
[3:33:54] have to do that we just take for granted
[3:33:56] thank you thank you for your sacrifice

[3:34:46] as you have I pray that every young
[3:34:48] person is encouraged to run the race to
[3:34:52] make sure that they very often present
[3:34:55] themselves to you to be tuned and that
[3:34:59] we take our own courage to roll away the
[3:35:03] stone of doubt and may we like Shem

[3:35:18] arms may we be able to stand
[3:35:21] courageously against every tide of the
[3:35:24] enemy believing and defending that the
