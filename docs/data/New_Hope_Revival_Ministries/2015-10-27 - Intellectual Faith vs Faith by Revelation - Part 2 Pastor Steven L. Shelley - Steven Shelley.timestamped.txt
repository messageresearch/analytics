[0:36] [Music]
[0:38] this is the day that the Lord has made
[0:40] let us rejoice and be glad in it hello
[0:45] I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and you're
[0:47] watching the Eagles cry and I want to
[0:49] welcome you to the program today we've
[0:52] been having a wonderful time as we have
[0:54] studied God's word these past few weeks
[0:57] and months and I'm just so thankful for
[1:00] the privilege that God has given me to
[1:03] be able to come to you wherever you are
[1:06] in the world well I'm in little tiny
[1:10] Smith Station Alabama USA perhaps that's
[1:14] a long way from where you are right now
[1:17] and so that's why I count it such a
[1:19] privilege that the Lord has given us to
[1:22] be able to bring these programs of study
[1:25] of teaching and sometimes a little
[1:27] preaching too to be a blessing to you to
[1:29] Str strengthen you in your faith I know
[1:32] that things are looking dark out there
[1:34] but in inside of the children of God is
[1:36] a glorious light the light of the Lord
[1:39] Jesus Christ he said I am the light of
[1:42] the world and you and I are here in this
[1:45] Earth for such a time as this that we
[1:48] might be able to reflect that great
[1:50] light that lives within us you know we
[1:53] study the Old Testament scriptures and
[1:55] we find a God who was above us who lived
[1:59] above the people people in a cloud in a
[2:01] pillar of fire that's how he manifested
[2:03] himself and then we look to the newer
[2:05] Covenant we start reading the gospels
[2:08] and we see a God who was with us
[2:11] Emmanuel in the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:13] walking and talking teaching Healing The
[2:16] Sick raising the dead and then on the
[2:19] day of Pentecost in Acts chapter 2 we
[2:21] see another great installment another
[2:25] great demonstration of God in the earth
[2:28] and that was through the baptism of the
[2:30] Holy Ghost and Fire it was prophesied by
[2:34] John the Baptist he will come and
[2:36] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with
[2:39] fire and we read that it happened in
[2:42] Acts chapter 2 that great day when Peter
[2:45] stood up and preached that amazing
[2:48] sermon uh this is not what you think it
[2:51] is these are not drunk as you suppose
[2:54] but this is that which was prophesied by
[2:58] the prophet Joel that in the last days I
[3:01] will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh
[3:05] and you know that's exactly what
[3:07] happened that day it was the beginning
[3:10] of the New Testament Holy Ghost filled
[3:14] Church body of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[3:17] so what was that was that just a another
[3:22] uh part of God another person of the
[3:25] godhead what was that that was none
[3:29] other than The Same Spirit that lived
[3:32] inside of our Lord Jesus Christ in fact
[3:36] the Bible tells us if that same spirit
[3:39] that raised Jesus from the dead if it
[3:42] also dwell in you it shall also Quicken
[3:46] your mortal body and Jesus told his
[3:50] disciples I will not leave you
[3:52] comfortless I will come to you and
[3:55] that's exactly what he did it's also The
[3:59] Same Spirit
[4:00] that overshadowed his Earthly mother
[4:02] Mary so that she conceived this little
[4:07] baby Our Savior he's not a baby anymore
[4:10] he's not in the manger anymore in fact
[4:13] he's not on the cross anymore his Spirit
[4:16] lives inside of us and he is ever at the
[4:21] father's right hand even right now at
[4:23] the Throne of God making intercession
[4:27] for you and I I'm so thankful today
[4:30] folks that we have a high priest who can
[4:34] be touched with the feelings of our
[4:37] infirmities he knows what you're going
[4:40] through he feels your pain even in that
[4:44] moment when you feel weak and you feel
[4:46] tempted to uh to give up you feel
[4:49] tempted to follow uh sin you know follow
[4:53] the lust uh follow the desire that gets
[4:56] stirred up in you for the things of this
[4:59] world
[5:00] and even in those moments our Lord
[5:03] understands that moment of weakness he
[5:06] understands the pull against your flesh
[5:08] the Bible said he was in all manner
[5:12] tempted as we are yet without sin don't
[5:17] ever forget that Jesus said because I
[5:20] have overcome you shall also overcome so
[5:25] the same spirit of God that was in our
[5:28] Lord Jesus Christ
[5:30] that caused him to be able to overcome
[5:33] not only the world the elements the
[5:36] spirit of the age but also death and
[5:39] hell and the grave that same Spirit
[5:42] lives inside of us to give us the grace
[5:45] to overcome whatever is thrown our way
[5:49] so I want you to know that we once saw a
[5:52] God above us and then the perhaps one of
[5:55] the greatest demonstrations was God With
[5:58] Us in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[6:00] but I tell you what Thrills me Beyond
[6:04] expression is that he is now God in us
[6:09] you get a good revelation of that and
[6:11] you'll kick the devil out when he comes
[6:14] to try to discourage you you'll just
[6:17] raise up now I don't mean it'll always
[6:19] be the first thought that comes to your
[6:21] mind no you've got to pull it you've got
[6:23] to dig down inside of you and find that
[6:26] truth and pull it up and then rebuke the
[6:29] devil the Bible said that if we submit
[6:32] ourselves unto God and then resist the
[6:35] devil he has no choice he has to flee
[6:39] from us uh I like reading about our Lord
[6:43] in the wilderness fasting and praying
[6:47] and here Satan shows up to tempt him the
[6:50] Bible actually tells us he was moved by
[6:52] the spirit driven by the spirit Into the
[6:55] Wilderness because this was a test that
[6:58] he had to face and I want you to know
[7:01] that when the enemy came one way and
[7:04] then changed his mask and came another
[7:06] way changed his mask and came another
[7:08] way the answer was always the same it is
[7:13] written and Jesus began to quote the
[7:16] word of God and I want you to know that
[7:20] we have the word of God it is ours it
[7:23] has been given to us it is a part of the
[7:26] love gifts that Messiah has given given
[7:29] to his Earthly bride in this hour is the
[7:32] word of God and that word is quick and
[7:35] it is sharp and it is powerful and it
[7:39] has the ability unlike any other force
[7:42] in the universe to discern between Soul
[7:46] and Spirit and so if you're wondering
[7:48] what realm you're operating in am I
[7:51] operating in the flesh am I operating in
[7:53] the soul am I operating in the spirit
[7:56] the answer is found in the revelation of
[7:59] the word of God now the the Bible that
[8:02] we have is the written record of God's
[8:05] word but I want you to know that when
[8:07] the Holy Spirit comes and anoints that
[8:10] word when when the pages of this book
[8:13] become alive before your eyes and I
[8:16] trust and pray that you've had that
[8:18] experience where you're just reading
[8:20] along and it it it feels like you're
[8:22] reading a maybe a Dusty story I'll just
[8:25] be honest something that was written so
[8:27] many hundreds and thousands of years ago
[8:30] that you can hardly relate to it and
[8:32] then all of a sudden the anointing of
[8:34] the holy spirit that anointing that
[8:37] breaks and destroys every yoke of
[8:40] bondage that anointing falls on you and
[8:43] the word the printed page word of God
[8:47] becomes the Living Word of God and it
[8:50] becomes a revelation in your life and
[8:53] then you have the ability once God
[8:56] reveals something to you once the word
[8:59] is Quicken to you and becomes alive in
[9:02] you it becomes a part of who you are
[9:05] that Revelation becomes a part of your
[9:08] spiritual DNA and you have every right
[9:13] to use that Revelation as a powerful
[9:17] weapon against your enemy it is
[9:19] absolutely yours given to you by the
[9:22] Holy Spirit through Revelation and
[9:25] that's what we started studying when we
[9:27] were together the last time we're
[9:29] talking about faith I want you to know
[9:31] the Bible defines faith for us in the
[9:35] book of Hebrews faith is the substance
[9:39] of things hoped for and the evidence of
[9:43] Things Not Seen if you can already see
[9:46] it it's not faith it doesn't require
[9:49] Faith to access what you can already see
[9:53] but when you are able to hope against
[9:56] hope when you are able to believe God in
[10:00] spite of the unbelievable circumstances
[10:04] in spite of the hopelessness of the
[10:06] situation but there's something on the
[10:08] inside of you that grabs a hold of the
[10:12] promise of God and you say I will not
[10:16] let my promise go you know that's what
[10:20] we really need we need more of the of
[10:24] the written word to become a Living Word
[10:27] in us a personal Revelation now a
[10:31] foundation for a personal revelation can
[10:34] be laid by good teaching and preaching
[10:39] pure uh not doctrinated not adulterated
[10:44] mixed up compromised Twisted to say
[10:48] something but the pure word of God given
[10:52] to us by Revelation made personal that's
[10:56] what Revelation does it makes the
[10:59] promise it makes the word of God become
[11:02] personal and it gives us the authority
[11:05] to use that promise absolutely against
[11:09] the enemy and so you know uh remember in
[11:13] the Bible that that some of the
[11:15] followers of Jesus were going to cast
[11:18] out demons from from the man and uh
[11:22] especially the sons of ska they were
[11:24] going to cast out the demons out of this
[11:26] man and they began to adure him in the
[11:30] name of Paul you know in the name of and
[11:32] and the demons cried out and they said
[11:35] Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are
[11:39] you what Authority do you have this is
[11:42] what they were saying where is your
[11:44] Authority where is the life behind the
[11:47] name here you're using these names but
[11:50] you have no personal connection to the
[11:53] name of Jesus you have no personal
[11:55] connection to the name of Paul or Peter
[11:57] or any of the other apostles how do you
[12:00] think you can use it like a magic remedy
[12:03] like some uh Magic expression some word
[12:06] magical words the demons knew better
[12:09] than that didn't they they came out they
[12:11] came out because they wanted to come out
[12:14] but the Bible tells us they they
[12:16] stripped the clothes off of these men
[12:18] and these preacher boys went running
[12:20] through the streets without their
[12:22] clothes on and that's exactly what will
[12:24] happen to you if you try to take the
[12:28] word of God and use it without a
[12:30] connection to it without a revelation of
[12:32] it without a
[12:33] relationship with it uh it's not a
[12:37] magical formula it has to become a part
[12:40] of who you are and we as children of God
[12:44] elected by God before the foundation of
[12:47] the world we come here with a
[12:50] representation of God in us and yet we
[12:54] need God to come and fill up that place
[12:57] um it's like a seed and that seed has to
[13:01] be watered it has to be uh in the
[13:03] presence of the sun this time the s o n
[13:07] instead of the Su n and it has to be
[13:10] fertilized by faith and we have to hear
[13:13] a word that awakens us it's like uh
[13:18] Sleeping Beauty awakened by a kiss in
[13:21] the kids's fairy tale you need the kiss
[13:24] of the Holy Spirit to awaken you out of
[13:27] your deathly sleep so that you can
[13:29] embrace the word of God and all that it
[13:32] represents and brother sister when you
[13:35] begin to receive Revelation on the word
[13:38] of God you become a viable threat to the
[13:41] enemy I'm telling you if you'll just you
[13:44] know believe what the preacher oh yes
[13:46] that's good amen preacher I like what
[13:48] you said that was very good and then go
[13:51] out and forget all about it you're no
[13:53] threat to the enemy he's going to walk
[13:55] all over you but if you begin to ask ask
[13:59] that the Holy Ghost the holy spirit of
[14:01] God when you're sitting in the service
[14:04] or you're listening to to this fine
[14:06] Christian television network and you're
[14:08] hearing the word of God go forth begin
[14:11] to ask that the holy spirit of God would
[14:14] give you
[14:16] Revelation you know someone said is that
[14:19] okay for me to ask is it all right for
[14:22] me to isn't that presumptuous for me to
[14:25] ask that God make his word real to me oh
[14:28] no friend that's exactly what God wants
[14:31] to do he wants to take this written word
[14:35] and transform it into a Living Word in
[14:39] you most of the time the first God that
[14:43] people meet is the written record of God
[14:46] and yet and that's good because that
[14:48] helps to uh certainly correct some of
[14:50] the error of our tradition and our false
[14:53] Faith false religions so thank God for
[14:57] the written word the absolute record of
[15:00] God's word but I want you to know Satan
[15:02] can still come and and and and confuse
[15:05] you and move you off of what you hear
[15:09] but once that becomes a revelation of
[15:12] faith I mean it gets way down on the
[15:16] inside of the inside now you know when
[15:18] we first come to the Lord we believe
[15:20] what we're taught people teach us they
[15:22] they show it to us seems like in the
[15:24] scripture and we say well that's what it
[15:26] says that must be what it means and we
[15:29] we go along with that then the enemy
[15:32] comes and we start trying to use those
[15:35] principles that we've learned we find
[15:37] out they're not working like they're
[15:38] supposed to work because we have
[15:40] believed a misunderstanding a
[15:43] misrepresentation of God's word that's
[15:45] why we need Holy Spirit Revelation
[15:48] that's why we need God to anoint our
[15:52] eyes with Isa because when we get the
[15:56] true understanding of God's word the
[15:59] full beautiful complete revelation of
[16:03] the Lord Jesus Christ when that becomes
[16:06] a part of who we are it changes
[16:09] everything now does that mean we no
[16:11] longer have problems well I wish I could
[16:13] tell you that and be honest but that's
[16:15] not the case in fact you may see an
[16:18] increase of trouble well thanks for
[16:20] telling me now I know I don't want any
[16:22] part of that well if it's for you if
[16:25] this Revelation is for you if God is
[16:29] unveiling himself to you you can't run
[16:32] from it you absolutely can't he's going
[16:35] to find you he's going to seek you out
[16:38] he's going to begin to orchestrate
[16:40] situations in your life where you keep
[16:43] coming in contact with a revelation that
[16:45] God wants you to learn about to to
[16:48] submit to to understand and so okay yes
[16:51] maybe sometime when we start moving up
[16:54] in Revelation toward the the Perfection
[16:58] uh the stature of the perfect man the
[17:01] Lord Jesus Christ sure the the enemy
[17:03] rages sure the devil gets upset and he
[17:07] Huffs and he Puffs and he tries to blow
[17:10] our house down but he can't because our
[17:13] house is no longer built on the
[17:16] traditions of men it's no longer built
[17:19] on the dogmas and Creeds of false and
[17:23] Harlot religion it is now built on the
[17:26] Rock the solid rock not just on Peter
[17:30] Petro that little Stone uh many people
[17:34] are looking to Peter as the first pope
[17:38] and as the F uh as the true foundation
[17:40] of the church well I want you to know
[17:43] that the church is not built on any one
[17:46] man it is built on the revelation of
[17:49] Yeshua the revelation of the Lord Jesus
[17:53] Christ whose Foundation is the prophets
[17:56] and the apostles that's what the
[17:58] scripture tells us it's not built on
[18:01] Peter or or Phillip or Thomas or any of
[18:04] the other great men great evangelists
[18:07] great Apostles of the scripture only on
[18:10] the Lord Jesus Christ now when God
[18:13] begins to make that word real to you
[18:16] again it becomes a part of who you are
[18:19] it gives you the equipment the unction
[18:21] that you need to stand against the enemy
[18:24] so when Faith becomes anointed faith is
[18:27] just a part of the written word
[18:29] there's other things that we need to
[18:31] understand we need to understand love we
[18:33] need to understand hope we need to
[18:35] understand courage and and uh patience
[18:38] we need to understand longsuffering and
[18:40] meekness and joy and peace and so forth
[18:43] but faith is such an important concept
[18:48] to get ah hold of Faith becomes nearly
[18:51] tangible when it is Anointed when it
[18:54] comes from a revelation it changes
[18:57] everything um you know you can have
[19:00] intellectual faith and that is okay it
[19:04] actually is okay because it's a starting
[19:06] point but it's not enough to slay the
[19:09] Giants it's not enough to cast out
[19:12] demons it's not enough to defeat the
[19:14] enemy in your life you're going to have
[19:16] to have the Holy Spirit to breathe on
[19:19] your faith to Quicken it to make it
[19:22] alive to get it out of grave clothes you
[19:25] know uh Jesus said concerning Lazarus
[19:28] who he had just just raised from the
[19:29] dead loose him and let him go and you
[19:31] know that's my prayer for you that God
[19:34] would loose your faith that he would
[19:36] pour anointing on that faith and
[19:39] Revelation on that Faith so that you
[19:41] would start to believe When Faith
[19:43] becomes a revelation we haven't even
[19:46] looked at our scriptures or our notes
[19:48] today but I feel pretty good anyway when
[19:51] Faith becomes a revelation when it
[19:55] really becomes uh a part of you it
[19:58] changes your vocabulary that's where I
[20:01] need help sometime because what I know
[20:05] and what I say don't always line up and
[20:08] yet the scripture said out of the
[20:10] abundance of the heart the mouth
[20:12] speaketh and so we have to ask that God
[20:15] brings such revelation of faith in us
[20:18] that even our thought processes because
[20:21] before something can come out of our
[20:23] mouth a word can come out of our mouth
[20:26] it starts in a thought process so I've
[20:29] been asking the spirit of God to to
[20:32] cover my thought processes so that when
[20:36] I start thinking about a situation and
[20:39] and expressing it whatever that
[20:40] situation is when it becomes expression
[20:43] through words I want my vocabulary to
[20:47] Ring to to uh uh be like the the tolling
[20:51] of a bell I want it to sound out like a
[20:55] trumpet my faith I want my faith to be
[20:58] demonst strated by my vocabulary and by
[21:01] the way I live my life and one of the
[21:04] ways that you can see when faith is not
[21:07] a pure Revelation in someone's life is
[21:09] fear is present I want you to know fear
[21:13] is the enemy your enemy wants you to
[21:17] fear to fear man to fear cancer to fear
[21:21] death to fear change uh uh to fear
[21:25] sickness it goes on and on and on and on
[21:27] fear calam ity uh fear death and and if
[21:31] he can uh anoint Us in fear if the enemy
[21:35] can sow and spread fear in our lives it
[21:40] paralyzes our faith when faith is only a
[21:44] mental concept but when Faith becomes
[21:47] more than intellectual Faith or mental
[21:50] concept faith when it becomes Faith by
[21:53] Revelation it cannot it will not it
[21:57] refuses to be paralyzed by fear in fact
[22:03] faith will rise up and and and oh I
[22:06] almost said something kind of
[22:08] strange I I won't say that because
[22:11] perhaps you'd misunderstand my the
[22:14] expression in the South you know we have
[22:16] all these strange Expressions so I won't
[22:18] say that I'll just say that Faith Rises
[22:21] up to to look fear in the eye and say
[22:25] get out of here you are not a part of
[22:29] this Blood Bought Holy Ghost filled
[22:32] Spirit washed child of God and so that's
[22:36] one of the reasons why it's so important
[22:38] and we started looking last time at the
[22:40] life of Peter and we watched his faith
[22:43] be transformed from only intellectual
[22:46] Faith to Faith by Revelation he got a
[22:49] true Revelation that that Jesus was the
[22:54] Messiah the Messiah the Son of the
[22:56] Living God and that re ation never
[23:00] wavered it never wavered now there were
[23:03] some things about Peter's Faith That
[23:05] Shook and that was his relationship with
[23:09] him remember we talked about last week
[23:12] that he denied his
[23:14] relationship uh they said to him you
[23:17] know you're one of them and he said oh
[23:20] no no that was in Luke chapter 22 oh no
[23:23] uh I don't know what you're talking
[23:25] about you know uh uh Thou Art also of
[23:28] them and Peter said man I'm not and he
[23:31] denied but notice he didn't deny who
[23:33] Jesus was no sir because that had become
[23:37] a very clear Revelation to him in
[23:40] Matthew chapter 16 and so he didn't deny
[23:43] who Jesus was he only denied that he had
[23:47] a relationship with him and that is
[23:50] tragic because that's what the enemy
[23:52] would like to do to you squeeze you into
[23:55] a place of denial where you would deny
[23:58] perhaps you would never deny that Jesus
[24:00] is the savior the son of the Living God
[24:03] but if he can get you to deny that you
[24:05] have a personal relationship with him
[24:08] not because you joined the church not
[24:10] because you shook a preacher's hand or
[24:12] your name was inscribed on the RO book
[24:14] of the church but because you're born
[24:17] again of the spirit of God it's not
[24:20] about joining a church shaking a hand
[24:23] filling out a card going through a
[24:25] process that's not enough that's only
[24:27] intellectual ual connection but
[24:30] Revelation connection what connects Us
[24:33] by the spirit to the body of the Lord
[24:35] Jesus Christ is a born again experience
[24:38] being saved by the by grace through the
[24:41] blood being Sanctified by the washing of
[24:44] the water of the word and being filled
[24:47] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[24:49] Fire these are the stages that bring us
[24:53] into the new birth into the true Born
[24:56] Again experience and when that becomes
[25:00] real to you it's hard for someone to
[25:03] talk you out of it if you just go
[25:05] because a lot of folks are going to
[25:06] church you go with them okay I believe
[25:09] what they're saying is true okay that's
[25:11] good but it's just the beginning you've
[25:14] got to have that
[25:15] transformation of Mind Faith
[25:19] intellectual Faith mental Faith to a
[25:21] true Spirit anointed breathed on faith
[25:25] so don't let the enemy come and try to
[25:28] make you deny your relationship with him
[25:30] he loves you you know even if you're not
[25:32] walking in the way that you should walk
[25:35] even if you're not fully doing what you
[25:37] know to do the Bible does say to him
[25:40] that knows to do good and does it not to
[25:42] him it is sin there's no doubt about it
[25:45] and so I'm not trying to cover up your
[25:47] sin or compromise with you in the area
[25:49] of sin but what I am telling you is your
[25:53] sin does not change his love for you and
[25:57] it doesn't change his purposes for you
[25:59] he still wants to bring you to that
[26:02] intimate walk to that true relationship
[26:06] with him but what happens so many times
[26:09] is people get discouraged by their own
[26:11] failure and they give up listen to me if
[26:14] you could save yourself if you could fix
[26:17] all that's wrong in your life by
[26:20] yourself why would Jesus have had to
[26:22] come why would he why would he have had
[26:26] to suffer and die and raise again the
[26:30] whole process would have been uh
[26:33] repetitious unnecessary it it would have
[26:36] been absolutely there would been no need
[26:39] for that but because we cannot do it
[26:42] ourselves because we needed a great high
[26:45] priest because we needed a token who
[26:47] would give us both grace and mercy he
[26:51] came thanks be to God he came and so
[26:55] don't be discouraged by your failure get
[26:58] up and keep pressing toward the lord
[27:02] Jesus Christ you'll get it you'll get
[27:04] this thing he'll strengthen you and
[27:07] underg guard you and help you father I
[27:09] ask you for that right now in the mighty
[27:12] name of the Lord Jesus Christ those who
[27:14] are struggling in their faith those who
[27:16] have failed and the enemy is using that
[27:19] failure to sabotage their faith I rebuke
[27:22] that Devourer I rebuke the enemy and
[27:25] resist him in the name of the Lord Jesus
[27:28] Christ and I tell that enemy take your
[27:30] hands off the children of the most high
[27:33] God and Lord bring breathe strength and
[27:36] life into them now I pray in the mighty
[27:39] name of Yeshua our Messiah the Lord
[27:42] Jesus Christ thank you so much for
[27:45] watching the Eagles cry today tune in
[27:47] again next time I have plenty more to
[27:49] share bye-bye for now
