[0:00] You can have power of attorney, legal
[0:03] rights to conduct business in the name
[0:06] of the person, the grtor,
[0:09] &gt;&gt; the one who has granted you the legal
[0:12] rights to act on his or her behalf. If
[0:16] Jesus is saying, I give unto you a state
[0:20] of control over something by legal
[0:24] rights because we know the whole
[0:26] universe, everything that God created is
[0:29] operating under a legal system. [music]
[0:32] &gt;&gt; It is it's a judicial system.
[0:35] &gt;&gt; It's not earth's legal system.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; It's not earth's judicial system. It's
[0:40] the legal system of the kingdom. There's
[0:43] no doubt in my mind that there is an
[0:46] ancient of days. There is one who sits
[0:49] with a white wig.
[0:51] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; We see him in the book of the
[0:54] revelation, hair white like snow, the
[0:56] glorified Christ. We see him as the as
[0:59] the wigged one also as the ancient of
[1:02] days in the book of Daniel. And he has
[1:05] the the the the authority, NOT ONLY THE
[1:08] POWER and ability, HE HAS THE AUTHORITY
[1:11] TO EXECUTE JUSTICE
[1:14] &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR LIFE.
[1:17] &gt;&gt; And all you have to do is beseech him.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; Request
[1:26] &gt;&gt; ask
[1:27] &gt;&gt; and it shall be. Yes,
[1:30] &gt;&gt; a judgment, a justice, a just decision
[1:34] rendered from the legal system of the
[1:37] kingdom. And so anything that happens in
[1:39] earth under the jurisdiction of a legal
[1:41] system is some earthly imitation. But
[1:45] you can rest assure
[1:47] that there's a higher
[1:50] a higher legal system,
[1:52] &gt;&gt; a higher system of justice.
[1:55] I I I tell you when we were children in
[1:58] the Pentecostal church, they called it
[1:59] praying through. But when that burden
[2:01] begins to lift a little bit
[2:03] &gt;&gt; and faith begins to take a hold, we call
[2:06] that praying through.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know it's more than
[2:09] that. When that burden begin to lift and
[2:12] some joy comes and some peace comes in a
[2:14] situation that's got you out of your
[2:16] mind.
[2:17] &gt;&gt; When you feel that, I want you to know
[2:19] it's because there's one above it all
[2:22] who has rendered
[2:26] A just decision
[2:28] &gt;&gt; on your behalf,
[2:30] &gt;&gt; not in any court authority,
[2:33] &gt;&gt; the authority of authorities,
[2:36] &gt;&gt; the power of all powers,
[2:38] &gt;&gt; king of kings and lord OF LORDS, THE
[2:42] CHIEF AND ULTIMATE POTENTATE OF THE
[2:45] ENTIRE UNIVERSE. HE IS ALL AUTHORITY.
[2:50] And when he says enough,
[2:53] &gt;&gt; sometimes he's saying, "Hold on, it's
[2:55] coming.
[2:56] &gt;&gt; That'll do." Have you ever had that
[2:59] sense of peace that says, "Hold on,
[3:00] it'll it'll change."
[3:02] &gt;&gt; Hold on. [snorts]
[3:04] &gt;&gt; That'll do. But once you get that place,
[3:07] that place of faith and you know that
[3:09] you know that you know no you don't know
[3:11] how the details are going to pan out and
[3:13] you don't know how the circumstances are
[3:15] going to bring the ultimate goal into
[3:17] reality but you know that you know that
[3:19] you know that you know THAT YOU KNOW
[3:22] THAT FIVE MINUTES AGO YOU FELT ALL ALONE
[3:24] AND YOU WERE CARRYING THE WEIGHT OF THE
[3:26] BURDEN ALL BY [screaming] YOURSELF AND
[3:29] ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE FELT THE
[3:31] STRENGTH OF THE LORD AS HE AS HE PUT HIS
[3:33] SHOULDER UNDERNEATH BENEATH YOUR LOAD,
[3:36] YOUR WEIGHT, YOUR BURDEN,
[3:39] &gt;&gt; and it begin to get lighter. He also has
[3:42] full authority
[3:44] &gt;&gt; to commission you
[3:47] &gt;&gt; to use that explosive power.
[3:50] You do understand that the kingdom
[3:52] operates not by power,
[3:56] &gt;&gt; not by might,
[3:58] &gt;&gt; but by my spirit,
[4:00] &gt;&gt; by my jurisdiction,
[4:03] &gt;&gt; by my breath,
[4:05] &gt;&gt; says the Lord. You've got to have the
[4:08] ability, the might, the strength of the
[4:11] Lord. But if you don't have his
[4:13] authority, if you're not moving in his
[4:16] authority, which is ultimately his
[4:19] government established in the kingdom,
[4:22] &gt;&gt; you will make a big old
[4:25] mess.
[4:27] &gt;&gt; Can you say, do you want to know how
[4:29] many of you want to know Yiddish? Here's
[4:32] a Yiddish word. Polygon.
[4:37] You will make a big old polygon.
[4:40] you will draw attention to yourself
[4:44] instead of the one you're representing.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; It's very important that we know what to
[4:52] do.
[4:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; We know how to wield to use
[4:57] the the power that's been given to us.
