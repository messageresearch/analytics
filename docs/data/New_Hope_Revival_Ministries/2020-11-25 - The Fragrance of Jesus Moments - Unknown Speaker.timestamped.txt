[0:01] it's the very fragrance
[0:03] of jesus christ
[0:08] [Music]
[0:13] the essence of who jesus is
[0:16] would have never been released
[0:19] on the earth he had to be crushed he had
[0:22] to be squeezed
[0:24] there's something on the inside of us
[0:27] that we are not always
[0:28] aware of and when god
[0:31] allows us as chief spices
[0:35] in his recipe when god allows
[0:39] us to be crushed it's not to destroy us
[0:44] it is to break open it is to lay aside
[0:49] that
[0:49] hard shell that keeps the true essence
[0:53] of who we are back
[0:54] and it is to make a way for that aroma
[0:58] to be released god said i'm going to do
[1:01] that in the last days
[1:02] i'm going to have a people who smell
[1:05] just
[1:06] like the lord who is this
[1:09] that i see coming out of the wilderness
[1:13] leaning on her beloved and he goes on to
[1:16] talk about
[1:17] her aroma her perfume her fragrance
[1:20] and it takes a mixture of
[1:24] suffering and blessing because there is
[1:27] a fragrance
[1:28] that must be released in the last days
[1:31] and it's not the fragrance of church
[1:35] brother branham specifically said it's
[1:37] not a baptist odor
[1:40] it's not a methodist odor it's
[1:43] not a pentecostal fragrance no no no
[1:47] it's the very fragrance of jesus
[1:50] christ that has to be released
[1:54] in the earth and he said how does it
[1:57] happen and how would it come
[1:58] through the bride
