[0:07] I want you to know the most beautiful
[0:08] thing about fully adopted Sons when they
[0:11] begin to fully manifest they're going to
[0:13] come forth in such Authority because
[0:15] they are
[0:17] spirit-led instead of body Le flesh Le
[0:20] and they're not going to be it's like
[0:22] this and I haven't used this example in
[0:24] a little while but let me use it here
[0:25] and then move
[0:27] on we could say for instance that what
[0:29] whatever you feed the
[0:31] most is going to rule in your
[0:35] life you believe that brother vandom
[0:37] talks about the Indian story of two dogs
[0:41] black dog on one shoulder white dog on
[0:43] one shoulder and and you know uh they're
[0:46] both
[0:48] talking one of them is saying do the
[0:50] right thing one of them saying do do
[0:53] what you want to do or do the wrong
[0:54] thing and and which one are you going to
[0:57] listen to well you're going to listen to
[0:58] the to the loud
[1:02] lest and what determines which one's
[1:04] louder the one you feed the
[1:06] most you understand so if you're feeding
[1:10] your soulish man mind will and emotions
[1:14] more than you're feeling your spirit
[1:17] man the regenerated Fallen human Spirit
[1:20] that's now become the spirit of Christ
[1:22] Living inside of you if you're feeding
[1:25] the solish man more than the spirit man
[1:28] this the solish man was he begins to
[1:30] look like a sumo
[1:33] wrestler and the Little Spirit man
[1:36] inside of you begins to look like a
[1:37] little
[1:40] Stickman now who's going to get the job
[1:42] done the sumo
[1:44] wrestler if you keep feeding the soul
[1:47] the mind the will and the emotion if you
[1:49] keep feeding constantly the mind and the
[1:51] will and the emotion how do we do that
[1:53] by
[1:54] entertainment by by by negative things
[1:57] by by negative movies by negative uh
[1:59] environments by negative talk by
[2:01] listening to dirty jokes by telling
[2:03] dirty jokes by reading on on Facebook
[2:06] things you shouldn't read you know you
[2:07] know you shouldn't
[2:09] read by participating in in in blogs and
[2:13] things you shouldn't be on and even
[2:15] podcasts that you shouldn't be listening
[2:16] to if it's contrary to the word you
[2:18] better leave that thing alone because
[2:21] it'll make the sumo wrestler in you lead
[2:23] your life and what you really want to do
[2:25] is you want it to be the other way
[2:27] around you don't you don't want to stick
[2:28] man as your spirit and assume or restor
[2:31] your soul you want to turn that thing
[2:32] around and you want your soul to be like
[2:35] a stick
[2:36] man woo and whatever the spirit
[2:40] says not my spirit it's not mine anymore
[2:45] it's his
[2:47] spirit I will not leave you comfortless
[2:50] I will come to you it's God in us he's
[2:56] no longer just above us he's no longer
[2:59] just with us where is he
[3:01] living in us and I don't want him to
[3:06] shrink because I'm feeding my flesh and
[3:08] feeding my soul oh I want my spirit man
[3:12] to have muscles I want to keep yielding
[3:15] my inner being every time the word Goes
[3:18] Forth I want to hold my spirit out there
[3:20] and I want to say help me sword of the
[3:24] word help
[3:26] me cut as you go in and cut as you come
[3:30] out but I know I'll be
[3:33] whole I know you won't leave me wounded
[3:35] and
[3:36] bloody I know you won't leave me hurt a
[3:40] and in trouble to die by the wayside I
[3:43] know that you'll both Pierce me and
[3:46] restore me I know that you will both
[3:50] tear me and you will also mend me isn't
[3:53] that what the word does the same word
[3:55] that cuts us heals us the same word that
[3:58] tears us apart heart puts us back
[4:01] together better than we ever were before
[4:03] somebody ought to help me
[4:05] now oh thank God for what this word is
[4:11] not what it can what it is accomplishing
[4:15] in his body
[4:16] hallelujah what it is
[4:19] accomplishing woo I want to thank him
[4:21] for
[4:26] that
