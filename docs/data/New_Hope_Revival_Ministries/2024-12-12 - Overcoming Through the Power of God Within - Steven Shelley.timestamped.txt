[0:13] to overcome I've got to overcome
[0:17] somebody I've got to

[0:24] overcome this word this message teaches
[0:28] that there is a total
[0:30] Deliverance
[0:33] available and church people are being
[0:36] wooed into a stuper into a coma and
[0:41] being sold an
[0:43] idea that that's not attainable for
[0:48] you how many of you understand that a
[0:51] lot of times it's not as dark as it
[0:54] looks it's not as bad as it
[0:56] feels God is on the throne
[1:00] God has never lost a
[1:03] battle God has never forgotten one of
[1:05] his children we're engraved in the palm
[1:09] of his hand he couldn't forget us if he

[1:36] Christ that's the very eternal spirit of
[1:39] the father now dwelling in the life of a
[1:43] Believer it's not the third person of a
[1:48] trinity it's almighty God fulfilling his
[1:52] desire he didn't just want to live above
[1:55] you as father or walk with you as
[1:58] Emmanuel
[2:00] he wanted to live inside of
[2:03] us and the only way he could do it is
[2:06] what he said I will not leave you
[2:08] comfortless I will come to
[2:12] you living inside of us you may have a
[2:17] struggle with a man between your two
[2:19] elbows but I want you to know there's
[2:21] somebody else living in here that's come
[2:24] to solve every problem he's come to
[2:26] deliver you from every
[2:28] situation he's come to throw you a
[2:31] Lifeline amen a John 15

[3:30] there's a way out of that kind of a
[3:33] slump there's a way out of that
