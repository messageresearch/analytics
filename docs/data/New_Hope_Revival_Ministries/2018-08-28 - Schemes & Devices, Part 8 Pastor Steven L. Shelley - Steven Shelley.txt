TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Christ in you the hope a lord hello and welcome to the program today I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New Hope revival ministries and I'm coming to you today in partnership with the gospel channel brother Eric Erickson and all of the fine staff at the gospel channel we're working together to bring you some programming hopefully that will encourage you and strengthen you on your journey and we're thankful to God for the opportunity to do so we appreciate very very much your correspondence being able to hear from you by email or by phone call and those of you who have also called at a different time we're in a different time zone and so you just graciously left your prayer request on the machine and as I mentioned before a sister will transcribe that and we print it off and immediately it becomes a matter of Prayer for not just myself but for many of us in fact in our services here at our local church we hold up the folder and we pray also for your needs we believe in the power of prayer and we believe in faith having faith in God and we know that faith in God can move mighty mountains in all of our lives and so we thank you and I think I should say that several of you have have given you have sown some seed into the ministry and although we we've not asked for support for ourselves we definitely want you to support the gospel channel in prayer and in your financial giving but to those of you who felt impressed of the Lord to help us it is a great blessing to us we have a large vision and we are totally depending on the Lord to provide for that vision we've had some opportunities arise and we are invited to be on other networks and all of this is in the hands of the Lord it would by the grace of God if that were possible and if he opens that door and makes the way then we would just welcome it we would be excited but thank you for being in touch with us and don't forget to let us know when God is moving and when you see answered prayer then also pass that along to us and we'll rejoice with you at the goodness of God this is number eight this is part eight in a series that we have entitled schemes and devices it is not the will of God that we should be ignorant concerning the devices that the enemy uses against the body of Christ in this hour when we ended broadcast number seven in this series we were reading in the amplified bible Ephesians chapter six and we already read it and shared it in the King James and we were breaking it down and I'd like to go back to where we were and finish that up and then move forward in the series in verse 13 therefore put on God's complete armor that you may be able to resist and stand your ground on the evil day of danger and having done all the crisis demands to stand firmly in your place stand therefore hold your ground having tightened the belt of truth around your loins and having put on the breastplate of integrity and of moral rectitude and right standing with God and that's about where we were ending the King James Version translates that breastplate of righteousness and we were teaching that it is not entirely our moral high standing or our righteousness that that really provides the breastplate of protection but it is his righteousness we become the out working the going forth of his righteousness and I gave you an example of a couple times in my life I didn't go into the detail but I shared with you that there were some times that I was faced with a big decision and I was tempted to choose a little bit less than then really what God's best was for me if I would have made the choice then there would have been more finances there would have been more promotion it would have been you know a socially better choice we could say and yet I knew somewhere in my heart that that was not the best that God had for me and but I found it difficult to make that decision it just bogged me down I hope you understand my expressions and it was in that moment that I realized that I did not have in myself the strength to make the right choice I needed to let the Lord know I need your righteousness I need your integrity I need to know that I am working with you that I that I have you in my life strengthening me to make the right decision that breastplate is an important part of the armor it protects those vital organs we mentioned the lungs and the heart and so it's very important that in the spiritual battle of the Christian journey that we are protected that our entire body both physically and spiritually is protected against the wiles of the enemy and and hasn't God been so good to provide a portion of armor to protect us in every way imaginable and given us the weapons that we need to move forward in this in this great battle verse 15 said and having shod your feet in preparation to face the enemy with the firm footed stability and promptness and the readiness produced by the good news of the gospel of peace the King James Version just says having your feet shod with the preparation of peace but I like the way the amplified carries it forward and having shod your feet in preparation to face the enemy firm footed in firm footed stability the promptness and the readiness produced by the good news of the gospel of peace he has us covered and then verse 16 lifts up over all the covering Shield of saving faith upon which you can quench all the flaming missiles of the wicked one that's the shield of faith above all being lifted up a covering to quench all of the fiery darts or missiles of the wicked one and verse 17 and take the helmet of salvation and the sword the spirit wheels which is the Word of God the sword that the spirit wheels I like that I like the way that's translated it's the sword of the Spirit but it's the sword that the Spirit uses in warfare and what is the sword it's defined for us which is the Word of God or I don't know if you're catching that or not but the Word of God in the hand the spirit becomes the most effective sword the most effective weapon against the enemy I'm so thankful that the Word of God when used by the spirit you know the Bible says and we have spoken about it here on this program the letter killeth but the spirit make it alive you can take the printed letter of God's Word and use it for all sort of selfish purposes and use it to bring more death and anything else but when the Spirit of God uses the word when the when that anointing and that inspiration and that oil of the Spirit begins to pick up the word and use it for the purposes of God I'm telling you there's just no stopping the sword of the Lord the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God when we use the sword of the Spirit it often is working at levels that you and I as soldiers cannot see and and what that means is because the Word of God handled by the Spirit is a living entity it there's life in the word when the spirit picks it up or takes it up as you would hold a sword in your hand when the Spirit handles the Word of God I hope I'm not confusing you because it's really a beautiful picture when the Spirit takes up the sword of the word I'm telling you much can be accomplished but sometimes it's not all out in the open sometimes the spirit uses the word of God in ways that we cannot readily detect with the natural eye because this is not a natural Wharf this is not a battle of the flesh as we have spoken often but it's a spiritual battle that can only be won with spiritual weapons and spiritual tools if I should try to use the Word of God for my own purpose to argue to to condemn to force someone to see it my way I could be guilty of imparting death but if I should allow the Spirit of the Lord to take up the Word of God as a tool or as a weapon then I know whether I see it with my natural eye or not I know that God's perfect will is being accomplished if it's not manifested immediately in this natural realm then I know that something has shifted in the realm of the Spirit this is so important for you and I to learn to be sensitive and to recognize that just because we don't immediately see victory in the natural realm does not mean that nothing is being accomplished over there in the spirit realm I believe the victory is won in the spirit realm first and then it is actuated or carried out in the natural realm so just take courage and just believe that it's not what we see with our eye but it's knowing that God's Word is a mighty weapon in the natural a sword can only reach as far as the arm can extend you know that's the leaf if you know no matter how long the sword is you can you pick that up and and it can only go as far as the arm can carry it forward but I'm talking about a sword the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God I'm talking about a weapon that can go much Arthur by prayer it can go much farther with our faith attached to it it can accomplish many more things in in in battle we could say then what the arm can reach it - in other words prayer and spiritual warfare and praying against the works of the enemy using the word of God against our enemy it can have far-reaching effects on the other side of the world much farther than the physical arm could extend a physical sword so we have a better sword we have better weapons than what the natural soldier hand we have those spiritual weapons and while a sword in the natural would be limited in many ways the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God really knows no limitations when God's word is spoken decreed declared with the inspiration with the spirit holding it taking it up I'm telling you it goes far and it accomplishes what God's intentions are in a particular situation and this is what we know when God's Word is released by the Spirit when God's Word is sent forth by the Spirit it accomplishes everything that's in the heart and the mind of God and it always releases a spirit of increase when the word of God goes forth by the spirit it always releases a spirit and atmosphere of increase I'm thinking about a scripture in the book of Acts Acts the twelfth chapter and the 24th verse but the Word of God grew and multiplied now I know that there could be a natural understanding of this verse of scripture it could mean that the news of the gospel spread into further territory than it had ever spread before but I believe this verse is speaking not only of the natural going forth and spreading of the word but also of the spiritual increase that comes when the word is set forth by the spirit let me just make this a little practical we've read the Bible we read it oftentimes we've read it for years I've you know as many of you have I've disciplined myself through the years to read the Bible from cover to cover but I couldn't possibly think that by reading it from Genesis to Revelation that I would absorb or comprehend or understand all that is contained in the written record of God's Word I've had the Spirit of God to highlight certain portions certain books of the Bible a particular or verse in the Bible and make it real to me and I knew that I had read it over and over again and just got a few little layers of understanding but when the Spirit takes up the word when the spirit drops that revelation and inspiration on a verse or on a passage it becomes it almost takes on a new identity because it lives the spirit is what makes the written record of God's Word live and because of that there may be a particular situation in your life and you're praying and praying for Direction strategy Lord show me what to do I don't even know how to pray have you ever have you ever said that lord I don't even know how to pray all I know is this is a mess and sometimes what we have to say is not my will but your will be done your will be done on earth even as it is in heaven because there are times that we can't even really immediately discern what the will of God is in a particular situation but what is so powerful it's when by prayer seeking the Lord he will lead you that inner voice of God leads you to a particular passage of Scripture and then give you the inspiration to decree that word to declare that word now now in order to do that we're almost always using it a bit differently than its context for instance a verse that was written as a letter from the Apostle Paul to the church at Ephesus and yet we're taking this verse and using it in a personal way is that illegal absolutely not now to form doctrine or theology we can't take a verse of scripture out of its context and build a whole idea on it that's not what I'm encouraging you to do at all but but I'm saying it's so powerful when the Spirit of the Lord will take a verse of scripture highlight it to you by the spirit and then release some Authority for you to decree that word into your situation into into what you're facing and what I what I would say about that is that is the lord extending the reach of the sword that is God taking this verse of scripture extending its influence its authority in its power it's the Spirit of God using the word in our lives like a weapon you just decree and declare it when the enemy comes with his lies just let the Spirit of God lead you and direct you to a verse of scripture that you can use against the enemy it's always a good idea to speak the Word of God it's always a good idea and I tell you I've had to do it some time in situations when I didn't know what to pray really didn't know what to say and just pick up the Bible and read the Book of Psalms just let the Lord direct me and and and what happens in doing that is your reading the words of another man's prays to God but you start reading that aloud and guess what happens your spirit connects your spirit connects with the worship that was coming out of the psalmist David's overflow and and you become a part of that worship and you are saying to the Lord bless the Lord you're not you're not saying it as though you were David you know I'm David bless the Lord O David's soul bless the Lord oh no you you start identifying with it and you bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me you might have the Lord direct you to the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and are safe and you might start declaring that I will not live in fear I have a strong tower it is the name of the Lord I will run into that tower when I need refuge I will run into the name of the Lord when I need strength when I need healing when I need my hope restored so the Word of God becomes a beautiful guide for both prayer and for worship and the only way to discover that is to get in the book we have to get in the book and and when we do when the Spirit takes the word and extends its influence under inspiration then we can see that increase that comes it makes the Word of God a very present help a very present reality in our life and using the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God releases life into situations where only death has prevailed when the living word of God is used and that is the spirit using the word resurrection not only increase takes place but resurrection life becomes present it steps forward and death is left behind there may be situations that are dead hopeless absolutely hopeless if you had to figure it out you wouldn't even know how to begin but the Spirit of God can take the word make it a living reality in your prayer life and the next thing you know you see increase and you see resurrection we're ten minutes before when you were looking at it all you could see was death defeat hopelessness a dead end darkness and now you say my my the light of God is shining in that situation and guess what happens your faith becomes activated and your faith grows you know it's it's a daily this is a daily exercise it's something that we walk in we are walking in the spirit that means we're living in the spirit we're learning how to live less of a flesh driven life we're learning how to live less of an emotionally driven life or my own will driven life and we're learning more by the grace of God how to live a spirit life out of the resurrection life of Jesus Christ that resides that abides in the inner man of the believer powerful truth and it may seem simple to some it may seem complicated to some but remember we access it by faith whether it's too simple for you or too complicated for you you can walk in it anyway if you're willing to use your faith to exercise your faith in that in that direction death structures that we talked about earlier in this series death structures are pierced there they're sliced away when the word of God the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God is being used effectively it doesn't matter how strong look at generational curses and you've seen how certain strongholds have passed down in families from generation to generation don't you accept that as though you have no choice in the matter because the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God you place the Word of God in the hand of the Spirit and let him use the sword and when that happens I don't care how long the death structure has been in place life can penetrate the death light can penetrate the darkness blessed be the name of the Lord Psalm 129 hold on to this one some 129 and verse 4 the Lord is righteous he has cut in pieces the cords of the wicked nothing plotted against you by the wicked weather that's wicked men and women whether that's wickedness which is represented by spiritual wickedness in high places whether it's a natural attack you know it seems like that that wicked and ungodly people or after you remember there's a bigger warfare going on than that which appears to be flesh and blood but it doesn't matter how it's coming what matters is he has cut the cords of the wicked with his mighty sword so no matter what the enemy is plotting to use to paralyze you to imprison you it can be broken it must be broken and the power of agreement is enough your faith and my faith joining together right now that really activates the Spirit of the Lord to move into a situation and take this sword and cut every cord every chain that the enemy would use to bind you to bind your family there's victory there is absolute victory our sword our sword the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God is sharper than any curse any curse of witchcraft that the enemy would try to place on you generational curses or are just simply witchcraft curses incantations there there is a lot of that kind of thing going on in the hour that we're living in today there's witchcraft on multiple levels those who practice the dark arts who operate someone said I don't even believe in those things well I'm not here to try to convince you that they're real but I am here to say that a lot of people are feeling the influence of those of those darker kinds of curses and incantations and those those kinds of things it's the body of Christ is being bombarded with this kind of an attack that's why we need intercessors who can operate in in the discerning of spirits that's why we need men and women who can reach in and discover what's behind this but I want you to know that that fear becomes a breeding ground for the enemy so you must not respond to whatever you see or hear or feel with fear you've got to answer it all no matter how dark it is you've got to answer it all with faith your sword the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God is stronger than any kind of curse any kind of encase pation that the enemy would speak against your life I don't care you know I'll just speak plain I don't care how high-ranking the witch is because this is often the case there are those who proudly call themselves witches and that's not those that we remember from cartoons with black cats and pointed hats and flying on a broom it's often times people who look just like you and I who have been looking for another source of power been looking for another sense of fulfillment and they have turned from truth from Jesus Christ who is the only truth and they have accepted the counterfeit the impostor the I'm telling you if you're operating in that kind of a power you're operating in counterfeit power you're operating in a legal authority and if you as a believer in Jesus Christ are in pharr are feeling the influence or you're being attacked by something from that dark side you've got the weapon oh yes you've got the weapon I keep saying it over and over again the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God you let the spirit take up the word on your behalf I mean you you can read the scripture just just by your own knowledge of the word do it but when the Spirit of God begins to fight on your behalf using this sword as we are told it's a gift given to us when that begins to take place I don't care where the wickedness is coming from where the curse is coming from it has to be broken in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and many curses are sent without a cause and we send them right back to the enemy and the authority of Jesus Christ we refuse them and we send them back we just we pray against unholy alliances we can come against those kinds of things in the authority of Jesus Christ every death structure must bow to his authority every spirit of death must bow to the authority of Jesus Christ every spirit of poverty and sickness and disease every every jealous spirit that has tried to take you out in your journey for the God toward the kingdom of God every bit of that has to bow to the authority of Jesus Christ we just asked for the Spirit of the Lord to take up the word you take up Lord let your spirit take up this sword and deal with those enemies and let us see the kingdom of God grow and prosper let's see the people of God break out of their prison and prosper in this late late hour it's possible it's it's not only possible it's happening and you might as well be a part of it you might as well put your faith in and believe that God can do the very same thing in your life you know sometimes we come under the influence of darkness because of what we're willing to tolerate it's it's not always what we participate in that's one way you know you can get involved in dark things by what you participate in you can you can you know a lot of people go to fortune tellers and a lot of people use those kinds of dark arts and the reading of tea leaves and reading of the palm and all of that kind of stuff when you do that then you open up your life the Ouija board and the seance and and all of this Halloween ridiculousness you get you get caught up in some of that and when you do you're opening the door for the dark side you're opening a door for the demonic to come in and and you know we saw a huge increase this is not going to be a popular thing to say but we saw a huge increase in in the demonic in in this kind of witchcraft when when the the children's books came out and the movies that followed and now amusement park rides etc built around this this whole idea of wizardry and learning to be a wizard and learning to operate in these kinds of spells and so forth and and I know many of you may not agree with me but we saw it in our nation we saw a large increase in this kind of spiritual attack and resistance when these books and movies became so popular because what they ended up doing is is taking something that can be so evil and making it look so appealing and so common and oh there's no harm in that and it's alright for children to play in and Dibble and dabble in those kinds of things and we saw kids dressing up and putting on the round glasses and and and trying to carry out the the nature of the character and the first thing you know is it's it it calls in an attack and and it becomes a bigger problem and we've certainly seen that and you have to whether you're aware of it or not it brought an increase of that of that demonic realm of Witchcraft and Wizardry spells and incantations but remember no matter what it is we got the sword we've got the remedy by the grace of God he has provided it for us but you may not actively participate in any of that but maybe you've tolerated it maybe rather than resisting it you just kind of go with the flow you know like any old fish can float down the river but it takes one with a backbone to swim against the current in Revelation chapter 2 verses 18 through 23 the church is being rebuked here not for what she actively participated in but for what she tolerated if you remember correctly to tolerate involves allowing something in our life that is not wholly approved Jesus condemned the Church of Thyatira for tolerating the influence and the teaching of that woman Jezebel remember you suffer Jezebel to teach to have influence to have authority and so you might not have been that church in Thyatira they might not have all been in a league or in Allegiance or alignment with this Jezebel spirit but they tolerated it they didn't want confrontation they didn't want to deal with it it was too much effort it seems and so they just sat under it doing nothing about it and I'm telling you that's not the way to expose the schemes and devices of the enemy we can't be passive in this hour this is the closing hours of time as we know it the kingdom of God is coming to Planet Earth there's a lot that's going to take place between now and then I believe there's a bride of Jesus Christ that's being prepared for for a final thrust of ministry that's gonna make a huge impact on the earth and then I happen to believe that little bride is going to slip away for a beautiful time of honeymoon a beautiful time at the wedding feast of the Lord and the earth is going to experience some things that we read about in the book of the revelation and and they have their their foundations even in the Book of Daniel and I truly believe that these things are coming and it's a very very exciting time but it's a disheartening time it's it's a serious time and we need to see that and so I ask you to search your life if you're really under the influence you can really feel that something is coming against you from from darkness let's say you know a satanic attack a demonic attack the devil is is moving against your finances or your body or your family in a given way then you have all of these weapons available to you but but if in all of that you're still not seeing breakthrough then you've got to start examining your heart you've got to start examining what what you're doing what you're what you're participating in any doors that you might have opened to the enemy windows that you might have opened that the enemy could gain access to your life and this could be it could be from movies it could be from violence violent movies violent video games it could be from from from books that you're reading that that are filled with violence and and and filled with things that are not whole and wholesome and holy you say wait a minute you sound like a fanatic well you know you can call me whatever you'd like to call me I mean that you're free to do that but remember I'm speaking to someone who's got a problem I'm speaking to someone who may have tried prayer who may have tried fasting who may have tried using the word of God and you're still not seeing victory well at that point I'm encouraging you I'm imploring you to start examining what it is that that seems to be giving the enemy a legal right to keep doing what he's doing technically he has to retreat at the name of Jesus technically he has to turn you loose when you speak the Word of God over the situation with the authority of the Spirit but if you're not seeing the breakthrough something is giving the enemy a legal right to keep harassing you in that manner and it's at that point you don't want to become religious you don't want to become fanatical you don't want to be looking for a demon under every rock but what you do want to do is ask the Lord to give you the earning of spirits help you to see any area in your life where you might have opened a door created an access point for the enemy to come in and I was just storing around some of the waste you could be in an unholy relationship the Bible is clear we should not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers when we are looking for relationships of love and marriage and future as children of God we should not be choosing partners among those who are not serving the Lord does that sound so fanatical and archaic you you can't can't accept it I don't know if it does or not but the truth is the truth if you are coming into a soul tie with someone who has not surrendered their life to the Lord Jesus Christ that could be the place of entry that could be the access point I feel like telling you that you could you could bring something into your home that could cause that there may be someone in the home who's hiding pornography there may be someone in the home who who asks would maybe dabbled in some of these things and there they've got books hidden in the home maybe you're just you're just totally sure there's nothing like that but it could be that someone has brought something in like that it could be that you've received the gift I know this is a stretch for some people but it could be that you've received a gift from someone where a curse or spirit was attached to that item and you've brought that into your home and the enemy is using something that simple as an access point I hope you just won't give up on me altogether but I feel like the Lord is is having me to share some of these things because if you've listened I don't know how many of you have made it all the way to number eight but if you've made it all the way to number eight that means that if you subtract a few minutes of speaking about prayer requests and and our friends at the gospel channel then you've almost listened to eight hours of teaching on schemes and devices so so you're not a newbie you know you you've had some you've heard a lot of teaching now and I feel like that some of you are ready to start asking the Lord hey I can't get a breakthrough you know I've had people pray for me and I'm not seeing the breakthrough and I think maybe the time has come for you to just begin to pray earnestly sincerely Lord show me if there is anything and we've had this happen several times in years past in our church community where the Lord would pinpoint for four different individuals so some possession something that had been given I've been a missionary to many many countries of the world and I've been given many many gifts and I've brought lots of things home and and there have been times at the Spirit of the Lord would speak to my heart and and have me to get rid of a certain item and it was usually something I really liked but get rid of that destroy that because there's something connected to it in another realm and it's not always been easy I remember one time there was something I have very few things that belong to my father and I had an item that was his when he was a boy and I I enjoyed having it it was like a connection to my dad but it was pinpointed by the Spirit because of what that item was and what it represented and the origin of that item that that the enemy was using that in some way and I I didn't warn it I didn't want to be a fanatic I what again I wasn't trying to find a demon under every little rock and cranny but I believe that the Lord let me see and I had to do something about it I had to do something about it because when I used the word of God in authority I want to see breakthrough when I take up the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God I want to see it accomplishing what the book says it will accomplish and when I don't see the results I don't I don't say such as I thought the word doesn't work never what I say is what's what's wrong with me let me do some more praying let me do some more searching so I hope you can understand that and sometimes people are members of certain societies and and clubs and and sororities are such such things as this that have some dark roots and there's a lot of things like that Freemasonry for instance instance some of these things need to be considered and looked at if you're trying to close all doors if you're trying to close all windows in your life the enemy I'm telling you he's sly and he'll use anything he can and you know there are some times of people in this hour sometimes some of these organizations especially those who operate in witchcraft they'll send people into churches they'll send people into communities to to cause chaos and we we must not be ignorant we can't be paranoid but we must not be ignorant of the devil's devices I hope you can see the balance that I'm trying to draw for you today we've got we can tolerate any stronghold or any principality just hanging over our faith community or our family or our house we've got to deal with it you know the days of being I'm just gonna tolerate it I'm not going to confront it somebody's got to speak up because this is a serious our first Thessalonians 5 20 and 21 tells us despise not prophesying --zz prove tests all things and then hold fast to that which is good so you've got to do a little evaluation you've got to do a little testing proving some time to see if this is really something that God is bringing into your life or if this is another Avenue that the enemy can use I'm telling you things like even the computer which is an amazing blessed to be able to minister through the through the internet but how the enemy can use that how the enemy can form relationships people can form relationships with someone they don't even know and all you know about them is what they've told you or what you read and you start creating these ties and things are not perhaps as you thought you're lonely so the enemy baits you into this kind of a situation you better know who you're in covenant with who you're in alignment with who you've come into agreement with in in really any level of relationship in your life and when God is or when the Apostle Paul is listing the gifts he's written a letter to the church at Corinth and he's speaking to to her about spiritual gifts in first Corinthians 12 and verse 10 he mentions that one of the gifts given by the Spirit of God to the church is the gift of discerning of spirits and that gift discerning of spirits brings an extraordinary ability to help us discern what is valid and what is not valid because sometimes the enemy shows up in the gray and and we can't distinguish black or white is this good or not is this God or is this the enemy trying to set things up for disaster and so that gift of discerning of spirits is one to ask for it's one to seek the Lord for and we're told to to seek for and ask for the gift to believe that God would would allow those gifts to operate in our life and I love prophecy and I love tongues and interpretation and miracles and and faith and so forth but but I'll tell you I think one of the most important spiritual gifts to ask the Lord for in this day in the moment we're living right now is for the discerning of spirits Lord let me be able to judge and to discern between that which is which is evil and that which you good some have said about the gift of discerning of spirits that it's like a spiritual Geiger counter that has a special capacity through the Holy Spirit to detect a presence of the demonic or or and sometimes revealing surprisingly detailed and accurate knowledge about the identity of the spirit or the intentions of the spirit and I've seen the gift of discerning of spirits operate that way you know a Geiger counter is a is a measuring device for seismic activity and and it can measure what can't be felt and what can't necessarily be be observed it goes deep and into the root of what's happening underneath the earth and and sometimes you know we we call we make a decision or we call a situation by what we see or what we hear just what we the gut feeling and I'm not telling you that that the gut feeling is not a good idea but there's something higher than that if you're a Holy Ghost spirit fill believer you have every right to believe God to operate those spiritual gifts in your life and you have every right to ask the Lord to help you walk in a greater measure of the discerning of spirits and that way you can sort of begin to detect and to and to know what is the root what is the root of this thing and what can be done to cut off the life of a particular attack or particular curse this Jezebel thing is something that we can't go into in the time that we have left but that spirit of control that operates in the same manner that Jezebel of the Old Testament operated in and I mentioned the kind of controlling Jezebel spirit that was operating in the Church of Thyatira and it is so sly it operates for a long time sometime for years even sometime beneath the surface and then when that spirit rises up and begins to take a hold of a church or of a community or of a family it can really wreak a lot of havoc and we've got to believe that even in those very serious situations we have Authority we have victory but we've got to be able to see in the spirit and know what we're up against and in all of the warfare in all of the of the discovery of trying to know what it is that's going on guard your mind guard your thoughts don't allow your thoughts to run off in in every direction but pray for the covering of the Lord over your life so that you do not operate in paranoia that you do not become a paranoid person but that you become a sensitive person to the things of God I hope that makes sense one of the of the other very important pieces of the of the spiritual armor that we were reading about just a moment ago is the helmet of salvation the helmet of salvation we think about salvation is is when the Lord saved our soul and we have salvation in our heart and and we think of salvation is something rather abstract but but here the scripture said that we should put on or take on take the helmet of salvation if the breastplate is there to protect our lungs and our heart and other vital organs what would the helmet of salvation protect well of course the other very very vital organ in the body the brain but but on a spiritual sense in a spiritual manner the mind we are to put on the helmet of salvation as a form of protection for our mind the greatest battle ever fought is being fought right now on the battlefield of the believers mind this is how the enemy desires to to influence you is with your thoughts you know he's not gonna just March up to you without a mask and and tempt you into something that he already knows you're not going to swallow but but if he can slightly twist your thoughts over a period of time and discourage you with lies until your faith sinks and you become so despondent that you can't even call on the name of the Lord then he can come in and present something to you and you may you may swallow that hook line and sinker we're in a stronger time in your life you would have refused it and recognized it immediately for what it was we need the helmet of yeshua we need the helmet of salvation to protect our mind and to protect our thoughts the head which we could say includes the mind is what's being protected notice Paul says take the helmet of salvation take it that means put it on receive it and put it on so just being born-again just calling on the name of the Lord doesn't automatically place this helmet of salvation of protection over our mind and over our thoughts we must actively remember that we have this beautiful piece of armor given to us by the Spirit of the Lord and we must make every effort to take it just like the scripture said and put it on and it's being it's being spoken in kind of a commanding way take take the helmet indicating that even though we are saved the helmet is not automatically in its place when we when we meet again we'll carry that just a little bit farther because this salvation helmet is a very important part in in walking in a place of encouragement instead of walking in discouragement and father we just pray right now that you will take the words that have been spoken today we we delved into some uncomfortable territory there just a bit and there may be some folks stirred by what we have said but I ask right now but the truth that has been spoken today will reach its target and I pray Lord that the courage of the Lord will be upon the people of God and they will recognize if the enemy has had advantage in their life because of any of these entry points and I pray that you will increase the discerning of spirits in their life that they would be able to see what is good and what is not good what is of you Lord and what is not of you and I pray that you would remind them in that moment of every tool of every weapon of every piece of armor that you have given us to stand against the wiles of the devil and I pray right now that every every dark attack and every secret attack of the enemy and and his entry points would be exposed and revealed to the people of God right now and that their discernment again would be sharpened and they would know the mind of the Lord for how to move forward to break out and to break through what the enemy is using all of his schemes and devices against them against their families against their churches we pray this hope in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah I'm passionate about it because I believe it and I know that he works I know that his word works I know that he has given us what we need to win this battle he is the victory and I want to thank you for giving us your attend today and studying the Word of God with us and I hope that you'll join us again the next time god bless you we love you bye bye for today [Music] [Applause] [Music]
