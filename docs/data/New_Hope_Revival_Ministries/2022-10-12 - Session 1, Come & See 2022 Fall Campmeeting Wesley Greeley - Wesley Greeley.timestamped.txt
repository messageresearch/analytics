[30:14] quietest world
[30:16] you're ever going to live in
[30:18] yeah
[30:19] sometimes people get nervous when it
[30:21] gets loud do you get nervous at a
[30:23] football game
[30:27] you get nervous in a fight
[30:31] I don't mean with your husband I meant
[30:33] boxing
[30:34] that'll make anybody nervous
[30:39] oh my I always just told him if you
[30:42] don't like shouting you better stay off
[30:43] of my cloud
[30:45] because I plan to give him praise
[30:48] there's something about when we give God
[30:51] extravagant praise that's the best we
[30:54] have it may not sound as pretty as
[30:57] somebody else is or look as you know
[31:00] dignified as somebody else's but you
[31:02] know that's not what it's about it's
[31:04] about giving God what he deserves I
[31:07] could never praise him enough for what
[31:09] he's already done for me
[31:11] I don't know about your life but my 54
[31:14] years have been blessed because of him
[31:17] it's been life to me
[31:20] we want to welcome you to this service
[31:22] tonight what a wonderful atmosphere is
[31:25] here to get us started we have to push
[31:27] you always do you have to push all the
[31:30] yuck out
[31:32] and get ready to receive all the glory
[31:35] we've come from different places many
[31:37] have worked all day drug in tired and
[31:40] had to work had to come in and give of
[31:43] themselves on the music and there's
[31:46] always the first time visitors here have
[31:48] never been and they're going to check us
[31:51] out and we're going to check them out
[31:52] we're going to get all that over with
[31:53] tonight
[31:55] all the checking out I'm gonna look at
[31:57] you you're gonna look at me and
[31:59] we're either going to like what we see
[32:01] or not
[32:03] but like it or not we're stuck with each
[32:05] other for the next few nights
[32:07] so we better just learn to get along and
[32:10] let God have his way and then there's a
[32:13] host of people who are not here
[32:15] physically but who are streaming this
[32:18] service in the nations of the world and
[32:21] we send the love of Jesus to you and our
[32:24] thanks that you would take the time to
[32:27] be with us tonight we always have our
[32:29] midweek service on Tuesday night so uh
[32:33] it's very likely that there are people
[32:35] watching right now from across the world
[32:38] some who get up in the middle of the
[32:40] night as far away as Japan to be a part
[32:42] of our service and we want to welcome
[32:45] everybody we believe that God has an
[32:47] appointment with every one of us here
[32:50] this week and we believe he's going to
[32:52] have his way if you and I will not get
[32:54] in his way but yield to him let him do
[32:58] what he wants to do and we'll sort it
[33:00] out later if there's anything to sort
[33:02] out
[33:04] you know what I mean by that if somebody
[33:07] gets a little out of the way let them
[33:09] we'll sort that out later
[33:11] I'd Rather somebody get a little out of
[33:13] the way in their praise
[33:16] than to sit on their hands
[33:19] come on now we he's been too good to us
[33:22] for us to keep quiet now
[33:24] amen so we want to get ready very
[33:28] shortly from now to hear the word of the
[33:30] lord we believe that God gave brother
[33:32] Greeley a word from God for us on Sunday
[33:35] that positioned us strategically for the
[33:40] course of the next few days and His
[33:42] glory has been on everything everything
[33:45] that has been done his glory his
[33:47] presence has been on it and we're
[33:49] expecting him to move among us we've
[33:52] been a little bit in camp meeting for
[33:54] months now just not night after night so
[33:56] this is our chance to come and you know
[33:59] it it can build if we let it the body
[34:02] gets tireder but our spirit gets a
[34:04] little brighter and a little a little
[34:06] higher and we just keep reaching up by
[34:08] Sunday morning we might take the roof
[34:11] right off of this place
[34:12] I just want what he wants we want to see
[34:15] Souls saved we want to see somebody
[34:17] baptized with the Holy Ghost we want to
[34:20] see bodies healed we want to see the
[34:22] Lord reveal his word to you and to me
[34:25] that we can know more of him he's still
[34:28] revealing himself he's still unfolding
[34:31] himself and so we're expecting something
[34:33] good from the Lord tonight so let's get
[34:36] the offering out of the way offering is
[34:38] part of worship we're not going to say a
[34:40] whole lot about it tonight it's a part
[34:42] of worship even though our camp meeting
[34:44] is not a world attended there are still
[34:48] needs there are still expenses and we're
[34:51] just believing that God will meet every
[34:53] need and you know I had a phone call
[34:56] today from Jerusalem
[34:58] brother Isaac stoltzfus our one of our
[35:01] former Amish Brethren is in Jerusalem
[35:04] and he said he said this is an amazing
[35:07] time but he said there's just one thing
[35:11] that would make it better
[35:13] and I said what is that brother he said
[35:14] if you were with us because we don't
[35:17] even know what we're looking at
[35:20] then he told me something so I just go

[36:30] he said I just don't know if I would
[36:32] leave Jerusalem to come to camp meeting
[36:35] he said you're gonna have to forgive me
[36:38] but the group is coming uh one van load
[36:41] is coming Friday and some more are
[36:42] coming on Saturday from Indiana and he's
[36:45] going to wait on him a couple hours at
[36:47] the airport they said and they're going
[36:48] to swing by and pick him up fresh from
[36:50] Jerusalem he just said he had a desire
[36:53] to be here he wanted to be or he felt to
[36:55] be here and you must really feel that if
[36:58] you leave if you leave Israel to come to
[37:00] camp meeting in Alabama but uh I it
[37:03] thrilled me because you know it could be
[37:05] the Lord has an appointment with him
[37:07] and I know God could meet him there or
[37:10] meet him anywhere but maybe the Lord has
[37:13] purpose to meet him here how many of you
[37:15] want to be where God wants you to be
[37:18] I mean all the time
[37:20] I want to be where he wants me to be all
[37:22] the time there are Divine appointments
[37:25] that are set up for us in restaurants in
[37:27] shopping places and
[37:30] I just asked the Lord Lord please give
[37:32] me all of mine and and wherever I but
[37:34] Lord please don't give me one in Walmart

[37:50] want to be sometime but anyway uh we
[37:53] don't have to talk about giving you

[52:48] our father that is our desire tonight is
[52:50] for your word to speak into our lives
[52:54] Lord we know that there are
[52:59] all varieties of people in this place
[53:03] with varieties of backgrounds and
[53:05] varieties of needs
[53:08] but you the one true Living God know all
[53:11] of them
[53:19] in our mother's womb
[53:22] when we were yet in secret you Lord were
[53:26] forming us and shaping us
[53:28] and then at a pointed time you called us
[53:31] into the Earth to be expressed
[53:34] now Lord you have chosen for us to be
[53:37] sitting in this place tonight
[53:39] there are those that are watching on the
[53:42] other end of that camera that you chose
[53:45] for this moment
[53:47] and so God we're asking you
[53:50] by your Divine Design tonight you would
[53:55] take words of the lips of clay and that
[53:59] you would speak to the needs
[54:01] individually God even though it may
[54:04] sound like the same English word you can
[54:08] take it and you can speak it in your
[54:11] Divine Manner and I'm calling on you to
[54:15] do that tonight oh Lord hide this vessel
[54:20] I pray behind the cross of the Lord
[54:23] Jesus Christ and only let yourself be
[54:27] seen God will give you glory and honor
[54:30] and praise for it is in the name of the
[54:33] Lord Jesus Christ that we pray
[54:36] amen amen amen
[54:39] Hallelujah
[54:41] while you're standing will you turn with
[54:43] me to Judges chapter 16. thank you to
[54:46] the Musicians I appreciate so much the
[54:50] gifting of God that you've let shine
[54:52] through your lives be a part of this
[54:54] service to help to set the atmosphere
[55:00] I have been pondering
[55:02] my actions on Sunday
[55:05] and
[55:07] there's some times when you jump around
[55:09] like a kangaroo
[55:11] you go away you feel foolish
[55:14] and you don't need to feel sorry for me
[55:17] because the lord gave me an answer
[55:19] standing right there
[55:21] Jeremiah said it feels like fire
[55:25] shut up in my bones
[55:29] and when you feel like fire is shut up
[55:32] in your bones you just don't know what
[55:35] to do with it
[55:37] and sometimes you stomp and sometimes
[55:39] you spin around in circles sometimes you
[55:42] jump up and down and so I'm just asking
[55:45] the Lord did every one of us before this
[55:49] week is out we'll experience that that
[55:52] energy inside of you that Supernatural
[55:56] you see friends it's not natural
[56:00] it's something that comes from another
[56:02] realm and I don't know how to explain it
[56:04] I was trying to find English words and
[56:07] that's what the Lord said it's like fire
[56:09] shut up in my bones and I'm looking for
[56:13] it again tonight and I'm looking for it
[56:15] to touch me and to touch you and to
[56:18] touch us every night this week because
[56:21] God has met he has designed a Divine
[56:25] appointment with us
[56:26] he is designed a sovereign move of God
[56:31] Among Us and I think that probably every
[56:34] night is going to look different from
[56:36] the night before and that's the way we
[56:39] want it we don't want to be able to
[56:42] design or control God in a box
[56:45] we want him to come and do something so
[56:48] mighty so Sovereign so Supernatural that
[56:53] no man can Define it and if we get a
[56:56] little out of control just don't worry
[56:59] about it God will bring everything right
[57:02] back into his perfect order
[57:05] because when Fire gets inside
[57:09] people act a little strange
[57:12] but I know that God is on the Move he's
[57:15] on the Move he's on the move
[57:18] Judges chapter 16.
[57:22] and I think that I want to start where
[57:24] did I tell you I was starting
[57:26] 21 I have 25 written here but 21 is
[57:29] where I want to start
[57:31] because the theme of this camp meeting
[57:33] is come and see and we're going to start
[57:35] with
[57:36] the Philistines put in the eyes of
[57:39] Samson out
[57:40] but the Phyllis
[57:42] Phyllis took him
[57:43] and put out
[57:48] Fetters of brass and did and he did
[57:51] grind in the prison house
[57:54] how be it
[57:56] the hair of his head began to grow again
[57:59] after he was shaven then the Lords of
[58:03] the Philistines gathered them together
[58:05] for their ought to offer a great
[58:08] sacrifice unto Dagon their God and to
[58:12] Rejoice for they said our God hath
[58:16] delivered Samson our enemy into our hand
[58:20] and when the people saw him they praised
[58:24] their God for they said our God hath
[58:27] delivered our hands into our hands our
[58:31] enemy and the destroyer of our country
[58:34] which slew many of us
[58:37] and it came to pass when their hearts
[58:40] were merry that they said call for
[58:43] Samson that he may make a sport and they
[58:48] called for Samson out of the prison
[58:50] house and he made them Sport and they
[58:53] set him between the pillars and Samson
[58:57] said unto the lad that held him by the
[59:00] hand
[59:01] suffer me that I may feel the pillars
[59:04] whereupon the house standeth that I may
[59:08] lean upon them now the house was full of
[59:12] men and women and all the Lords of the
[59:15] Philistines were there and there were
[59:17] upon the roof about 3 000 men and women
[59:21] that beheld while Samson made Sport and
[59:26] Samson called unto the Lord and said O
[59:29] Lord God
[59:30] remember me I pray thee and strengthen
[59:35] me I pray thee only this once o God that
[59:40] I may be at once Avenged of the
[59:43] Philistines for my two eyes
[59:47] Samson took hold of the two middle
[59:49] pillars upon which the house stood and
[59:52] on which it was born up of the one with
[59:55] his right hand and of the other with his
[59:57] left and Samson said let me die with the
[1:00:00] Philistines and he bowed himself with
[1:00:03] all of his might and the house fell upon
[1:00:07] the Lords and upon all the people that
[1:00:09] were therein so that the dead which he
[1:00:13] slew at his death were more than they
[1:00:15] which he slew in his life may the Lord
[1:00:19] add a blessing to the reading of his
[1:00:21] word you may have your seats tonight
[1:00:28] foreign
[1:00:30] I don't know who all is listening
[1:00:33] so we'll just give a little background
[1:00:37] to Samson
[1:00:43] this was in the time of the judges of
[1:00:46] Israel
[1:00:48] and
[1:00:50] the people were
[1:00:53] wandering here and there they really
[1:00:55] didn't have a lot of leadership
[1:00:57] and
[1:01:00] there was a woman
[1:01:02] her husband's name was Manoa
[1:01:05] but
[1:01:07] her name was not given
[1:01:10] apparently the Lord did not think it
[1:01:12] mattered all that much
[1:01:14] but one thing that I find extremely
[1:01:16] interesting was that the angel of the
[1:01:19] Lord came to her
[1:01:21] he did the angel of the Lord did not go
[1:01:23] to her husband but this woman was Barren
[1:01:26] she wanted a child and she sought the
[1:01:29] Lord about this child in the Angel of
[1:01:32] the Lord came to her and said that
[1:01:35] you're going to conceive and you're
[1:01:37] going to Bear a child and she later he
[1:01:40] laid the angel of the Lord laid out to
[1:01:42] this woman exactly what should be the
[1:01:46] the lifestyle of this child he was to be
[1:01:50] a Nazarite unto the Lord and he was not
[1:01:53] to have to partake of wine and strong
[1:01:56] drink he was not to allow his hair to be
[1:02:00] cut because therein was his strength it
[1:02:03] was a it was a covenant between him and
[1:02:06] the Lord but uh each after this Angel
[1:02:10] comes to manoa's wife she goes and tells
[1:02:14] her husband uh listen this Angel the
[1:02:17] angel of the Lord came to me and told me
[1:02:20] that we're going to have a son and what
[1:02:24] this whole thing is going to look like
[1:02:25] well Manoa he's a little shook up he
[1:02:29] wants to know you know what's going on
[1:02:31] and he wanted the angel to come to him
[1:02:33] and so he went and he sought the Lord
[1:02:36] would you please let the angel come to
[1:02:39] me and explain the same thing to me well
[1:02:43] Jehovah sneaky decided to show up to the
[1:02:47] wife again rather than showing up to the
[1:02:50] husband he shows up to manoa's wife
[1:02:52] again and manola's wife had to run and
[1:02:56] go find him and she says come quickly
[1:02:59] this Angel has showed up again now the
[1:03:02] good thing that we can say about that is
[1:03:04] that God answered his prayer it didn't
[1:03:07] come maybe the way that Manoa wanted it
[1:03:09] but God came and showed himself once
[1:03:13] again to uh to Manoa and to his wife and
[1:03:17] gave them instruction
[1:03:18] concerning the son Samson and Samson the
[1:03:22] Bible said begin to grow and in the
[1:03:25] spirit of the Lord would come upon him
[1:03:27] in the camp at times it probably wasn't
[1:03:31] real evident what was going on in his
[1:03:35] life but God was upon him and would come
[1:03:38] upon him at different times in his life
[1:03:40] and so Samson he he starts growing up
[1:03:44] and
[1:03:46] started getting his eye on women
[1:03:53] now these were Israelites
[1:03:56] Manoa and his wife
[1:04:00] and God had already laid out a pattern
[1:04:04] for their lifestyle
[1:04:06] he had called them to come out and be
[1:04:09] separate from other nations
[1:04:12] he wanted them to be different than
[1:04:14] every Other Nation
[1:04:18] God's covenant people and he wanted them
[1:04:21] to have the the the very essence of
[1:04:25] Heaven in their lives and he wanted them
[1:04:28] to display it in the Earth but as is
[1:04:31] with all Humanity there's always
[1:04:34] something that is pulling on them down
[1:04:37] in the natural and so because it's what
[1:04:40] they see with their natural eye they
[1:04:43] began to gravitate toward natural
[1:04:46] instead of Supernatural every one of us
[1:04:49] are guilty of it we because that we look
[1:04:53] around and we see different things we
[1:04:56] see somebody gaining some wealth and so
[1:04:59] the enemy uses that against us and
[1:05:02] starts pulling on us to try to get us to
[1:05:05] build wealth
[1:05:08] and forget the kingdom
[1:05:12] and if by some means God allows a man or
[1:05:16] a woman to to gain some wealth then the
[1:05:20] enemy wants them to become so
[1:05:22] concentrated on building that wife that
[1:05:25] it pulls them away from the house of the
[1:05:28] Lord it pulls them away some from their
[1:05:30] families and even it pulls them away
[1:05:33] from really building the kingdom and
[1:05:37] they start building their own kingdom
[1:05:40] because pride is something that man is
[1:05:44] dealing with just the same as the devil
[1:05:48] the enemy that angel Lucifer in Heavenly
[1:05:52] places Pride begin to get to him and he
[1:05:56] wanted to build his own kingdom and that
[1:06:00] spirit is not dead
[1:06:02] that spirit is
[1:06:03] trying to reach out in order people to
[1:06:07] be so enveloped in their own Pride that
[1:06:11] they forget the things of God and they
[1:06:13] go their own way but if God can ever get
[1:06:16] a hold of a man ever really get a hold
[1:06:20] of a man and that man can become so sold
[1:06:23] out to God
[1:06:26] thank you
[1:06:28] sometimes it takes extreme heartaches
[1:06:33] horrible heartaches
[1:06:35] in order to get a man into the place
[1:06:38] where God can completely use him I think
[1:06:41] sometimes about brother Branham and how
[1:06:43] that he he he was an humble man he was a
[1:06:47] a man that was poor but yet he went
[1:06:50] through such horrible tragedies in order
[1:06:52] for God to hone him into the man that he
[1:06:57] was supposed to be so that when he was
[1:06:59] standing before the people and that gift
[1:07:01] was in operation he was not susceptible
[1:07:05] to walk away and be proud and lifted up
[1:07:09] from it but he knew that it was a gift
[1:07:11] that God had placed in his life and he
[1:07:13] wanted to be totally yielded to that
[1:07:16] Holy Spirit in his life so that nothing
[1:07:18] would uh would magnify William Branham
[1:07:22] but it would magnify the Lord Jesus
[1:07:24] Christ
[1:07:25] so Samson now this man he's he's got his
[1:07:29] eye kind of roving
[1:07:33] looking at Philistine women instead of
[1:07:35] Israelite women
[1:07:37] and as he begins to look the Bible tells
[1:07:42] us that he finds one that he wants and
[1:07:45] he goes and he tells his parents I want
[1:07:48] this particular woman and his parents
[1:07:51] didn't understand what God was doing and
[1:07:54] and so uh they didn't want him to have a
[1:07:57] Philistine though don't you understand
[1:07:58] Samson that we're under their bondage we
[1:08:01] we just really don't want to want you to
[1:08:05] take this woman to be your wife but yet
[1:08:09] Samson said I want her
[1:08:13] so now
[1:08:15] the wedding is set in order
[1:08:17] the feast is set in order and they're
[1:08:20] going down to this Philistine wedding
[1:08:23] and along the way Samson encounters a
[1:08:26] lion
[1:08:28] and he
[1:08:30] tears him in pieces and leaves his
[1:08:33] carcass the the carcass of the lion
[1:08:35] laying beside the road and goes on to
[1:08:37] the wedding
[1:08:39] so
[1:08:40] all of these things are transpiring and
[1:08:45] and and I I you'll have to go back and
[1:08:47] read the story because my mind is is is
[1:08:49] getting uh messed up here because there
[1:08:52] ended up honey in the carcass of that
[1:08:54] lion
[1:08:55] all right and so when it goes to this
[1:08:57] wedding feast and he begins to tell them
[1:09:00] I got a riddle for you and if you can
[1:09:03] settle this riddle if you can come up
[1:09:05] with the answer to this riddle at the
[1:09:07] end of this Feast I will give you each a
[1:09:10] change of garments there were 30 of his
[1:09:12] companions that were there and and he
[1:09:14] wanted to if if they figured it out okay
[1:09:18] I'll I'll just give you these garments
[1:09:20] and at the end of it uh if if you if you
[1:09:24] don't figure it out I am going to uh
[1:09:27] require that you give me 30 changes of
[1:09:29] garments and so his wife is at him all
[1:09:33] this seven days at him oh come on you
[1:09:36] got to tell me you you can't leave me
[1:09:38] hanging you got to tell me what the
[1:09:40] answer is to this riddle well Samson
[1:09:43] said I didn't even tell my parents about
[1:09:44] it why am I going to tell you but she
[1:09:46] kept after at him she kept at him until
[1:09:49] that Samson finally gives her the answer
[1:09:51] to the riddle and then of course she
[1:09:54] goes and tells all of his companions
[1:09:56] because listen friends
[1:09:59] she was a Philistine
[1:10:03] the spirit of the Philistine was in her
[1:10:06] and she had all of these 30 companions
[1:10:10] that of samsons that were Philistine as
[1:10:13] well and she wanted did it she did not
[1:10:16] want the wrath of these 30 people on her
[1:10:19] she's probably getting this idea that
[1:10:22] I'm gonna marry this man and and he's of
[1:10:25] a of a whole different race of people
[1:10:28] and their Customs are all different and
[1:10:30] I don't know exactly how I'm going to
[1:10:32] fit in with this crazy bunch of people
[1:10:34] and and I I've got to have something to
[1:10:36] run back to if if if this doesn't work
[1:10:39] out and and so I'm just wondering uh I
[1:10:42] can't let this happen to my companions
[1:10:45] here and so she says come on Samson you
[1:10:47] got to tell me what's going on here what
[1:10:49] is the answer to your riddle and finally
[1:10:51] he tells her she goes and tells these
[1:10:54] guys and
[1:10:59] Samson's a little upset
[1:11:04] well
[1:11:05] the spirit of God came on Samson
[1:11:10] and he got the 30 garments
[1:11:13] but there were 30 Philistines that lost
[1:11:15] their lives
[1:11:18] in order for these garments
[1:11:21] to be given to these 30 companions
[1:11:25] now the story goes on that Samson
[1:11:28] he must have had a pouting problem
[1:11:31] don't know exactly what was going on
[1:11:33] with him
[1:11:35] but he went somewhere other than to his
[1:11:38] wife
[1:11:41] and in the process of time
[1:11:45] he decides
[1:11:48] I think I want her again
[1:11:51] and so he goes to find her
[1:11:54] and when he goes to find her he finds
[1:11:56] out that her dad gave her to another guy
[1:12:00] now this creates a problem
[1:12:08] Samson
[1:12:11] is offered the younger daughter
[1:12:13] the dad even says she's more fair than
[1:12:16] the older one
[1:12:17] you can have her if you'd like
[1:12:20] well Samson wanted his wife
[1:12:23] the one that he was supposed to have and
[1:12:26] he was now Angry that he did not uh that
[1:12:29] that the father-in-law would not give
[1:12:31] her to him and so he goes and he finds
[1:12:35] 300 foxes and he ties their tails
[1:12:38] together and sets them on fire and sends
[1:12:41] them through all the corn fields and the
[1:12:43] wheat fields and it starts burning down
[1:12:45] all of the crops and the trees and the
[1:12:47] houses and there is chaos everywhere
[1:12:51] listen
[1:12:54] Samson was a mess
[1:12:58] but God used him through all of his mess
[1:13:04] to do exactly what he said he was going
[1:13:07] to do because God had a vendetta I'm
[1:13:10] going to say he had a he had somewhat
[1:13:13] against the Philistines and he was going
[1:13:15] to use Samson to take some of them out
[1:13:18] he even used him or when when they began
[1:13:22] to say who did this oh it was Samson and
[1:13:25] so they go to the Israelites and they
[1:13:27] say you better give them to us
[1:13:29] so all of these Israelites they come to
[1:13:31] Samson he's on top of a mountain on top
[1:13:33] of a hill and they said listen Samson
[1:13:36] there's going to be some Bloodshed if
[1:13:39] you don't turn yourself in please let us
[1:13:42] take you down to these people and he
[1:13:46] said okay you can take me down to them
[1:13:49] you can even tie me up as long as you
[1:13:52] don't take my life they said you've got
[1:13:55] our worry you've got our word we won't
[1:13:58] hurt you just let us tie you up take you
[1:14:00] down to the Philistines deposit you
[1:14:02] there and we're out
[1:14:04] so that's exactly what they do but as
[1:14:07] Samson comes in to the camp of the
[1:14:10] Philistines bound up with ropes he all
[1:14:14] of the spirit of the Lord comes upon him
[1:14:18] now his muscle mass was useless until
[1:14:22] God got on him
[1:14:25] but when God got on him
[1:14:29] whom Mass changed and it's just like I
[1:14:32] was telling you a while ago it must have
[1:14:34] been like fire shut up in his bones and
[1:14:37] he had to do something about it and he
[1:14:40] began to just Flex a little bit and
[1:14:43] these ropes broke and laying there on
[1:14:46] the ground was a Jawbone of a of an ass
[1:14:49] and he started picks it up and the Bible
[1:14:51] said he slew a thousand Philistines
[1:14:55] now these Philistines were the enemy of
[1:14:58] God they had been by enemy for many many
[1:15:01] years constantly at the people of God
[1:15:05] every time you turn around you see that
[1:15:08] the Philistines are trying to take the
[1:15:11] people of God out
[1:15:13] and God would let them go
[1:15:16] sometimes he'd let them defeat the
[1:15:18] Israelites and other times God would let
[1:15:20] the Israelites defeat them
[1:15:22] God is using Samson to take these
[1:15:25] Philistines out one by one by one by one
[1:15:27] so now he's got this Jawbone in his hand
[1:15:30] and he starts taking them down one by
[1:15:33] one and he doesn't really understand
[1:15:35] what is happening he it's just the
[1:15:39] spirit of God upon him I don't know that
[1:15:41] his parents were ever able to explain to
[1:15:44] him exactly what the call of God was on
[1:15:47] his life even though the angel came to
[1:15:50] them and told them how to raise him what
[1:15:53] to help him to avoid what to be aware of
[1:15:57] in his life his parents really did not
[1:15:59] understand this spirit of God that came
[1:16:02] upon him when when it when it happened
[1:16:05] and they were they were just as
[1:16:07] oblivious probably to things as others
[1:16:10] were around him but God had his hand
[1:16:13] upon Samson and his Samson stayed
[1:16:16] yielded to the things of God God used
[1:16:19] him in a marvelous and a magnificent way
[1:16:22] and here he is with just a Jawbone
[1:16:26] a bone
[1:16:28] not a pipe
[1:16:30] not a piece of iron
[1:16:32] not a gun a bone and God got in the hand
[1:16:38] God in the man got in the bone and took
[1:16:42] out a thousand Philistines
[1:16:47] it's amazing what God can do when he has
[1:16:49] a yielded vessel
[1:16:51] [Music]
[1:16:53] what is in your hand
[1:16:55] use it that's what he told Moses Moses
[1:16:59] what is in your hand throw it down
[1:17:05] came a serpent
[1:17:07] I'll pick it back up
[1:17:10] stick again
[1:17:12] what do you have in your hand use it for
[1:17:14] the glory of God
[1:17:16] so now Samson he's still messing around
[1:17:19] with these Philistine women
[1:17:22] and and the Bible now after he's
[1:17:25] defeated these thousand Philistines the
[1:17:27] Bible tells us that Samson he started
[1:17:30] messing with prostitutes
[1:17:32] no more marriage prostitutes
[1:17:36] and he starts going down and he found
[1:17:38] one that he liked real well and her name
[1:17:40] was Delilah
[1:17:41] he
[1:17:42] apparently frequented Delilah and he
[1:17:45] goes down and he talks to her and he
[1:17:48] spends the night with her Time After
[1:17:50] Time After Time well the Philistines
[1:17:53] come to Delilah they said you know we
[1:17:56] could really give you a payoff if you
[1:17:58] could get the secret out of that old boy
[1:18:01] if you can get the secret out of him
[1:18:04] well the Bible says that Samson loved
[1:18:07] Delilah
[1:18:11] he loved this woman
[1:18:13] even though she was from the brothel he
[1:18:17] loved her
[1:18:18] and he went to her frequently and when
[1:18:21] he went to her frequently he uh she
[1:18:25] starts working on him because the
[1:18:27] Philistines are working on her ah you
[1:18:30] know we can give you a good payout we
[1:18:33] can set you up for Life you'll never
[1:18:36] have to bring another man into your
[1:18:38] house we'll give you a big house and
[1:18:40] it'll be all yours and and you won't
[1:18:42] have to do that business anymore we will
[1:18:45] set you up if you will help us to take
[1:18:48] him out
[1:18:49] so she begins to work on him
[1:18:52] Samson
[1:18:54] what is it
[1:18:56] where is your strength what is it that's
[1:18:58] in your strength that is is
[1:19:01] keeping you keeping the Philistines from
[1:19:04] conquering where is your strength where
[1:19:06] does it lay
[1:19:09] now I don't know how many nights days
[1:19:12] that it takes Delilah to work on him but
[1:19:16] the Bible gives us four specific
[1:19:18] instances
[1:19:20] that he gave her an answer that she
[1:19:23] tried
[1:19:25] now folks
[1:19:27] I want you to know your name is not
[1:19:30] Samson and the Philistines are not what
[1:19:32] are dealing what you're dealing with
[1:19:34] but I want you to know you are a child
[1:19:36] of God with a calling on your life and
[1:19:39] the same devil that tried to take Samson
[1:19:42] out is trying to work on you
[1:19:44] he is trying to take you out the same as
[1:19:48] he took Samson out because you have a
[1:19:50] Divine destiny that is to be carried out
[1:19:53] in the earth and the enemy wants to
[1:19:55] disturb it he wants to destroy it he
[1:19:57] wants to stop it he wants to disrupt it
[1:19:59] he wants to do anything that he can to
[1:20:02] keep you from fulfilling your god-given
[1:20:05] destiny in the earth and so Samson is
[1:20:09] he's he's laying in her lap and he
[1:20:11] says Samson baby Samson
[1:20:15] would you please tell me
[1:20:18] why don't you just tell me
[1:20:22] and
[1:20:23] he says well
[1:20:25] if if you bind me up with seven green
[1:20:29] whiffs or new not dried out ropes if
[1:20:34] you'll bind me up with that I'll be just
[1:20:37] like everybody else I won't be able to
[1:20:38] get out of them
[1:20:40] and so
[1:20:42] she does exactly that
[1:20:45] and she says the Philistines be upon you
[1:20:51] and he breaks out of them
[1:20:53] leaves the house
[1:20:57] but it does not stop Samson
[1:21:00] from having an attraction to Delilah
[1:21:07] what is your Delilah
[1:21:13] what keeps pulling you back
[1:21:18] come on
[1:21:19] because there are things that pull us
[1:21:22] over and over again and if we don't cut
[1:21:25] the head off of this serpent
[1:21:28] that serpent will keep coming back keep
[1:21:31] coming back keep coming back
[1:21:33] now we cannot physically take a sword
[1:21:43] we keep one here just in case
[1:21:47] oh
[1:21:49] come on we do we cannot
[1:21:53] physically take a sword and cut the head
[1:21:56] off of our enemy
[1:21:59] but the way we have to cut him off is
[1:22:02] quit giving him the attention that he is
[1:22:05] longing for
[1:22:07] Samson kept going back
[1:22:10] he knew that she was after him he knew
[1:22:14] that she wanted the secret after out of
[1:22:18] him for for his strength but yet there
[1:22:21] was something
[1:22:23] in him that kept going back and that is
[1:22:29] why we preach around here that people
[1:22:34] should not engage in sexual activity
[1:22:37] before marriage because there is a soul
[1:22:41] tie that happens between a man and a
[1:22:45] woman and it causes a man and a woman to
[1:22:48] keep wanting to come back
[1:22:53] there was a soul tie
[1:22:56] between Samson
[1:22:59] and Delilah that kept pulling him back
[1:23:03] because they had become one and there
[1:23:08] was something that kept pulling him back
[1:23:10] even though he knew that she wanted his
[1:23:16] secret
[1:23:17] and so he goes back a second time and
[1:23:22] and she's at him again baby
[1:23:25] you fooled me once
[1:23:28] oh darling I love you so much but you
[1:23:32] won't tell me what your secret is and so
[1:23:36] since uh Samson says bind me fast with
[1:23:39] new ropes never used and I'll be just
[1:23:42] like everybody else
[1:23:45] so Delilah does exactly that she binds
[1:23:49] him up again and she says Samson the
[1:23:52] Philistines now listen friends
[1:23:55] she always waited till he was asleep
[1:24:00] that's why the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:24:02] cannot sleep
[1:24:04] we've got to watch and be faithful in
[1:24:08] prayer because the enemy like a roaring
[1:24:11] lion is always seeking whom he may
[1:24:15] devour
[1:24:16] he's looking to destroy your life
[1:24:21] so Samson the Philistines are upon you
[1:24:25] and he breaks out of the ropes again and
[1:24:28] he goes off but that tie is still there
[1:24:35] there's something there
[1:24:38] that keeps pulling him back
[1:24:42] and there are people that are sitting
[1:24:45] under the sound of my voice tonight
[1:24:48] that are being pulled back to the same
[1:24:52] Vice over and over and over again and my
[1:24:58] recommendation to you this week in this
[1:25:02] Sovereign move of God in this holy
[1:25:04] convocation is for you to press into the
[1:25:09] spirit every day and every night until
[1:25:13] that thing is broken out of your life
[1:25:17] Deliverance
[1:25:19] there's Deliverance here friends
[1:25:21] there's Deliverance here oh and I want
[1:25:24] to warn you of something
[1:25:25] we're tongue talkers around here
[1:25:30] and in case you would misunderstand
[1:25:34] I just want to give you some
[1:25:36] clarification of why we do not in broad
[1:25:40] spectrum I'm going to give you a narrow
[1:25:42] Spectrum but when we begin to pray over
[1:25:46] somebody in another language in another
[1:25:49] tongue it is because God wants to do
[1:25:53] something phenomenal for you or for me
[1:25:56] it may only be for myself edifying
[1:25:59] myself but here's the way I explained it
[1:26:02] just a few weeks ago at another church
[1:26:04] let's just say sitting among us there is
[1:26:06] a person who comes to me and says I have
[1:26:10] sugar diabetes and I want to be healed
[1:26:14] from sugar diabetes
[1:26:16] well because I'm human because I know
[1:26:21] this person I know that they love their
[1:26:24] chocolate cake they love their ice cream
[1:26:27] they love their sweet tea and they don't
[1:26:30] seem to stop it they just go get them
[1:26:31] another shot or whatever it is of
[1:26:34] insulin to be able to bring their sugar
[1:26:36] down if I pray for them I'm in English I
[1:26:40] am going to have an opinion
[1:26:44] no matter what the disease is
[1:26:47] if I know him and I know their
[1:26:50] characteristics I may pray my opinion I
[1:26:55] may even stop and give them my opinion
[1:27:00] but if you will allow us to get under
[1:27:03] the spirit of God
[1:27:06] and let the Holy Ghost pray over you
[1:27:11] then
[1:27:13] the spirit of God can pray over you and
[1:27:17] he can intercede on your behalf way
[1:27:21] above my opinion
[1:27:25] and he can get the job done
[1:27:28] bypassing my opinion my intellect my
[1:27:32] thought process and we can when it's all
[1:27:35] said and done we can say thank you Lord
[1:27:39] you got that under control without my
[1:27:43] opinion
[1:27:43] [Music]
[1:27:45] so that's just that's just a for your
[1:27:48] information
[1:27:49] if you come and you let us pray for you
[1:27:52] and there seems to be a lot of tongue
[1:27:54] talking it's just simply because we want
[1:27:57] the spirit to pray over you instead of
[1:28:00] our own opinion
[1:28:02] so now Samson he's he's he's he's being
[1:28:05] pulled back to this woman
[1:28:08] over and over again as some sitting here
[1:28:11] or across that camera are being pulled
[1:28:14] back to the same Vice over and over
[1:28:16] again because there's some kind of a
[1:28:19] pool in the soul realm in the mind the
[1:28:22] will and the emotions that are pulling
[1:28:24] you back to that same Vice over and over
[1:28:27] again now we could sit here and we could
[1:28:30] talk about smoking we could talk about
[1:28:32] drinking we could talk about
[1:28:34] homosexuality or promiscuous uh sex or
[1:28:37] any variety of things but you know let's
[1:28:40] get down to as we were talking about
[1:28:42] Sunday and gossip and backbiting and
[1:28:45] pride and thinking more of ourselves
[1:28:47] than we ought to you know all of these
[1:28:49] things are things that cause us to be
[1:28:52] drawn back
[1:28:54] that's right
[1:28:57] because
[1:28:59] they bring a Feeling
[1:29:03] now there are people
[1:29:06] who
[1:29:08] have issue with us
[1:29:10] because we get a little Rowdy around
[1:29:12] here
[1:29:13] they tell us that we're
[1:29:16] basing too much on feelings
[1:29:26] shame on him
[1:29:30] but there are people
[1:29:33] who live in the natural Realm
[1:29:36] where that narcissism
[1:29:38] gives them a Feeling
[1:29:40] Pride gives them a Feeling
[1:29:45] certain sexuality gives them a Feeling
[1:29:49] it causes them to have a high
[1:29:52] well I would rather have a high in the
[1:29:55] Holy Spirit
[1:29:57] than to keep being drawn back to that
[1:30:00] same uh besetting sin that keeps me away
[1:30:04] from a real move of God in my life that
[1:30:07] keeps me from performing my predestined
[1:30:11] plan of God in the Earth
[1:30:16] we need
[1:30:18] to break these things
[1:30:21] need to allow the spirit of God to break
[1:30:23] them in our life
[1:30:25] but as I said on Sunday sometimes it
[1:30:27] takes part of our action
[1:30:30] sometimes it takes throwing that rock in
[1:30:32] the air to get things in the spirit
[1:30:33] moving Lord I'm activating my faith
[1:30:37] maybe it's just a step forward
[1:30:40] when the preacher says take a step
[1:30:42] forward maybe you're so determined that
[1:30:45] instead of one step you take two steps
[1:30:47] and you say God I am so determined to
[1:30:49] break this thing in my life that I am
[1:30:51] doing this prophetic act at the behest
[1:30:53] of this servant of the Lord he said do
[1:30:56] something and so I'm doing something
[1:30:58] because I want this thing broken in my
[1:31:01] life because I don't want to be a Samson
[1:31:03] I don't want my eyes poked out
[1:31:05] come on come on now
[1:31:07] Sampson
[1:31:09] pulled back to this woman a third time
[1:31:13] and every time that he goes
[1:31:17] she's pulling him closer and closer and
[1:31:21] closer to being burned
[1:31:25] so the third time she says
[1:31:27] now Sam
[1:31:30] you fooled me twice baby
[1:31:33] you've given me these reasons why and
[1:31:36] all this and so Samson he gets even
[1:31:40] closer to the reality the truth of where
[1:31:43] his strength is up to his hair
[1:31:47] and he says weave my Seven Locks with
[1:31:50] the web
[1:31:51] so she lets him go to sleep
[1:31:55] gives him what he wants and lets him go
[1:31:57] to sleep starts weaving this through his
[1:31:59] hair
[1:32:00] what that looks like I don't know
[1:32:02] exactly
[1:32:03] but I just want you to know it was
[1:32:05] getting too close
[1:32:07] to the calling of God in his life
[1:32:13] it was getting too close
[1:32:19] but when she woke him up Samson the
[1:32:22] Philistines are on you
[1:32:25] he gets up and he walks out the beam the
[1:32:28] web everything I don't know how big it
[1:32:31] was but he just got up and walked out it
[1:32:34] hindered him none
[1:32:36] because the secret was not yet out
[1:32:41] but Samson was still drawn to this woman
[1:32:48] I do not know what was going through his
[1:32:52] mind when he gave her
[1:32:55] that secret that close to the reason of
[1:32:59] his calling his hair when when God said
[1:33:03] that he wasn't supposed to drink strong
[1:33:05] drink and he wasn't supposed to let any
[1:33:08] razor come to his head a Nazarite vow
[1:33:11] also includes I believe dead things
[1:33:13] right and and don't touch dead things so
[1:33:16] we have the lion there's things already
[1:33:18] against him
[1:33:20] but yet God was still upon him because
[1:33:24] he still had that Nazarite vow of the
[1:33:26] hair and she he was he was given her way
[1:33:30] too close but yet he keeps being drawn
[1:33:35] back
[1:33:36] to this woman
[1:33:39] and as he is being drawn back to this
[1:33:42] woman over and over and over again
[1:33:48] he does not realize
[1:33:50] that there's going to come a final time
[1:33:53] all of his defenses are being broken
[1:33:56] down
[1:33:57] all of his inhibitions all of the all of
[1:34:02] the secrets that he's kept all of these
[1:34:05] years all of those Philistines that he
[1:34:08] has killed in the past because he kept
[1:34:12] the Covenant with the Lord all of that
[1:34:14] he's forgetting all of that not
[1:34:16] realizing that when the when the hair is
[1:34:19] gone that the strength is gone too the
[1:34:22] spirit of the Lord would depart he he
[1:34:25] thinks that he can do it amen but yet
[1:34:28] he's drawn back to this woman and she
[1:34:31] says now Samson
[1:34:33] you have
[1:34:35] you have told me lie after lie after lie
[1:34:40] you've
[1:34:43] told me
[1:34:44] where your strength would be at
[1:34:48] and it's not the truth now baby if you
[1:34:52] really love me
[1:34:57] if you really love me
[1:35:01] if you really love me
[1:35:04] you'll tell me
[1:35:11] now let's just call this what it is
[1:35:15] it was an abusive relationship
[1:35:21] it was
[1:35:24] because she knew all the while what she
[1:35:26] was after
[1:35:29] she was not after a relationship with
[1:35:31] Samson
[1:35:33] the Bible said Samson loved her but it
[1:35:36] listen come on she had
[1:35:40] a
[1:35:42] really she had a calling from the
[1:35:44] Philistines
[1:35:47] via what she had a calling from the
[1:35:49] devil via the Philistines
[1:35:52] and she had something that she was going
[1:35:55] to accomplish and she was going to do
[1:35:58] she was going to keep at it until she
[1:36:00] got what she wanted she wanted to
[1:36:03] destroy the man of God
[1:36:05] because she knew that the man of God was
[1:36:08] destroying her uh her people
[1:36:11] and they now she was no doubt going to
[1:36:15] get a big payout from it
[1:36:16] [Music]
[1:36:17] and so she wanted that payout but the
[1:36:21] fact remained she was a Philistine and
[1:36:24] it was her people that were being
[1:36:25] destroyed by this man and so she was
[1:36:28] kind of on board even though the money
[1:36:31] was another glitzy thing to draw her she
[1:36:34] was on board with them to get the secret
[1:36:36] out of this man and so Samson he goes to
[1:36:40] her this one final time and his defenses
[1:36:44] are being broke down broke down broke
[1:36:47] down now friends I want to tell you
[1:36:48] something this is exactly how it
[1:36:51] happened in the Garden of Eden
[1:36:55] oh
[1:36:57] when that serpent
[1:36:59] came to the woman she didn't have a name
[1:37:03] yet when that serpent came to the woman
[1:37:06] in the garden
[1:37:08] he did not beguile her the first time
[1:37:14] he worked on her mind over and over and
[1:37:19] over and over again breaking down her
[1:37:23] defenses over and over and over again
[1:37:27] and there must have been something in
[1:37:30] that serpent that was attractive because
[1:37:34] she kept coming back to find him and
[1:37:38] when she came back to find him he always
[1:37:42] had another lovey-dovey story to tell
[1:37:45] her
[1:37:46] yeah
[1:37:48] because he had an ultimate goal
[1:37:53] and it wasn't just to confuse her mind
[1:37:59] he did not want her
[1:38:01] to partake of the Tree of Life
[1:38:04] he wanted her to partake of the tree of
[1:38:07] the knowledge of Good and Evil he wanted
[1:38:10] to disrupt the whole plan of God but
[1:38:14] he's only the tool
[1:38:16] [Music]
[1:38:19] now Samson is in the same position as
[1:38:23] the woman was
[1:38:25] because his mind is being broke down
[1:38:29] broke down his his defenses against the
[1:38:33] spirit of the Philistines is broke down
[1:38:36] now I would just in a natural sense the
[1:38:42] Philistines were the enemy of Israel why
[1:38:45] would I go visit them
[1:38:49] yeah
[1:38:50] the Israelites were an enemy of Israel
[1:38:54] why would I go take a wife of them
[1:38:58] the Israelites were the enemy to
[1:39:01] Philistines the Philistines enemy to
[1:39:03] Israel why would I go to their house of
[1:39:06] prostitution and find me a woman and why
[1:39:09] would I keep going back to her and
[1:39:12] revealing my secrets now friends we
[1:39:15] sitting here have a bridal Authority and
[1:39:18] we have some Bridal secrets that the
[1:39:21] enemy would like to take and defile them
[1:39:24] and keep them from ever coming to
[1:39:26] fulfillment and that is why the Holy
[1:39:28] Spirit over and over again pulls us back
[1:39:31] and says
[1:39:33] better get control of your mind
[1:39:35] you better get control of your mind
[1:39:37] you better get control of your mind
[1:39:40] because that's where the enemy keeps
[1:39:43] coming
[1:39:44] This Is Where It Starts before the
[1:39:47] action ever takes place
[1:39:50] Samson was laying in the lap of Delilah
[1:39:53] and she is working on his mind why baby
[1:39:57] are you withholding this information
[1:39:59] from me
[1:40:01] come on you gotta tell me
[1:40:07] I don't know
[1:40:08] where Samson had been
[1:40:11] I don't know what he had encountered I
[1:40:13] don't know if he was just tired that
[1:40:15] particular night I don't know whether he
[1:40:18] had just been broken down so far in his
[1:40:20] mind till that he thought what's the use
[1:40:23] why why do I have to keep this secret
[1:40:25] I've already I've already had strong
[1:40:28] drink I broke that part of it I've
[1:40:30] already been around dead animals I broke
[1:40:33] that part of it what's another thing
[1:40:35] what does it matter I may as well just
[1:40:38] tell her and What's It Gonna matter
[1:40:43] but it mattered to God
[1:40:46] it mattered to God
[1:40:49] because
[1:40:50] when he gave her that secret
[1:40:53] she knew
[1:40:56] she knew that this time he had not lied
[1:41:00] to her
[1:41:01] this time he did not withhold the secret
[1:41:04] but he said a razor has never come to my
[1:41:09] head if you cut my hair off I will be as
[1:41:12] other man and she knew
[1:41:15] that he had given her the genuine secret
[1:41:18] of his strength
[1:41:20] and as she gives him she lets him fall
[1:41:24] off to sleep she's got men waiting
[1:41:30] listen boys
[1:41:32] I want you to know this is no fake out
[1:41:35] this time I know that he gave me his
[1:41:40] secret
[1:41:41] and I want you to be ready
[1:41:43] because I am going to cut his hair off
[1:41:47] and you're going to come in and take him
[1:41:50] well when she said Samson
[1:41:52] the Philistines are upon you
[1:41:56] Samson got up
[1:41:59] and he said I will go out and be as at
[1:42:01] other times
[1:42:03] not knowing that the spirit of the Lord
[1:42:06] had departed from him
[1:42:10] there is a day
[1:42:12] that you can go too far
[1:42:18] the Bible as we just read
[1:42:21] said that the first thing that they did
[1:42:23] when they took Samson captive was they
[1:42:26] put his eyes out
[1:42:28] the enemy wants to do the same thing to
[1:42:31] you
[1:42:32] he wants to put your eyes out he wants
[1:42:34] to put your spiritual sight out
[1:42:39] so that all of you that all that you see
[1:42:43] is the natural
[1:42:45] you quit seeing the spiritual
[1:42:48] you quit seeing the things of God you
[1:42:52] may still read your Bible
[1:42:54] but it's a dead letter
[1:42:57] you may even still speak in tongues
[1:43:01] but the spirit of God has Departed
[1:43:04] because the enemy has put out your
[1:43:07] spiritual eye
[1:43:08] and has caused you to become critical
[1:43:12] caused you
[1:43:14] to want to criticize everybody in the
[1:43:17] house
[1:43:18] might raise you up in Pride might do all
[1:43:21] kinds of things because he wants us to
[1:43:24] stay in the natural realm he does not
[1:43:27] want us to see the spirit Realm
[1:43:32] when they put Samson's eyes out
[1:43:35] they took him down
[1:43:37] to the grinding house
[1:43:43] all of my life
[1:43:45] I think about Samson down at the
[1:43:47] grinding house I can see him as one of
[1:43:50] the mules
[1:43:53] behind one of these bars that stick out
[1:43:57] it goes around in a circle all day long
[1:44:03] round in a circle all day long has no
[1:44:06] eyesight
[1:44:09] but all he's doing is going in a circle
[1:44:12] so he's not really
[1:44:14] but he's just grinding
[1:44:19] I read another thought today
[1:44:21] and I thought it could be just as
[1:44:22] monotonous
[1:44:26] and this idea was that
[1:44:31] Samson was sitting in the floor
[1:44:34] with a small bowl like a mortar and
[1:44:36] pestle
[1:44:38] just grinding all day long
[1:44:41] now either way it's boredom
[1:44:44] lots of time to think about all of those
[1:44:46] things of the past
[1:44:48] all of the ways that God used him
[1:44:52] all of the Philistines that were killed
[1:44:55] and now I'm in captivity
[1:44:57] it's going around in circles
[1:45:00] around in circles
[1:45:06] do you know that there are hundreds of
[1:45:10] people
[1:45:11] in this world who are in a prison of
[1:45:13] their mind
[1:45:17] there are preachers
[1:45:20] who have become
[1:45:22] so discouraged
[1:45:24] by what they saw in their congregation
[1:45:27] their spiritual eyes were put out
[1:45:31] and they just quit
[1:45:32] and now all they're doing is sitting in
[1:45:35] their recliner
[1:45:36] thinking about the good old days
[1:45:39] how the spirit of God will used to move
[1:45:43] how the things used to be
[1:45:46] but they got burned out
[1:45:50] they don't have any Vision left
[1:45:53] because the enemy came and put out their
[1:45:55] spiritual eyesight
[1:45:57] folks were blessed around here
[1:46:00] because the God has allowed us to Time
[1:46:04] After Time when the enemy wanted to put
[1:46:06] out the eyesight of the man of God
[1:46:09] wanted to put out your eyesight there
[1:46:11] was somebody to encourage you let's get
[1:46:14] back in the fight you cannot stop you've
[1:46:17] got to get your Eagle Vision back
[1:46:19] [Applause]
[1:46:22] you gotta get your vision back
[1:46:27] and you just remember we had a prophet
[1:46:29] in our day that said even John the
[1:46:31] Baptist his Eagle Vision got clouded
[1:46:34] over
[1:46:36] after all that he saw after renouncing
[1:46:40] that the Messiah was on the earth that's
[1:46:43] him the Lamb of God that takes away the
[1:46:46] sin of the world but he got put in
[1:46:48] prison and his Eagle Eye got clouded
[1:46:51] over
[1:46:54] oh
[1:46:57] something had to come along to clear his
[1:46:59] vision
[1:47:01] the Prophet Elijah
[1:47:03] after he had been on the mountain and
[1:47:06] had that great Mountain Carmel Showdown
[1:47:08] and all those prophets of Baal were were
[1:47:10] slain because that God came down and
[1:47:14] consumed Elijah's sacrifice after an
[1:47:17] all-day Affair of going around and
[1:47:19] around their sacrifice and nothing
[1:47:20] happening but God came down and let this
[1:47:23] fire fall and consume the sacrifice and
[1:47:26] their water and the rocks and everything
[1:47:27] else
[1:47:31] but there was a jezebel
[1:47:33] that came along and said listen here I'm
[1:47:37] going to take your head off just like
[1:47:38] you did my Prophets
[1:47:41] brother random said that Elijah's Eagle
[1:47:43] Vision got a little clouded over and he
[1:47:45] went and hid from Jezebel
[1:47:47] because he was a little bit disturbed
[1:47:49] that this woman was after after the
[1:47:51] mighty happenings
[1:47:53] and I just figure as Elijah sat under
[1:47:56] that juniper tree
[1:48:01] stroking the pound spirit
[1:48:05] God why
[1:48:08] why
[1:48:09] [Music]
[1:48:11] is all of this happening to me
[1:48:16] let all these good things happen
[1:48:19] and now I'm running from this woman
[1:48:20] Jezebel
[1:48:23] but his ego Vision had been clouded over
[1:48:28] there are people through life
[1:48:31] may have happened to us along the way
[1:48:34] where our Eagle Vision got clouded over
[1:48:38] the enemy kept at our minds just as he
[1:48:43] did Samson
[1:48:45] to try to get you to give up your secret
[1:48:50] give up your secret
[1:48:52] and for you to give away the reason of
[1:48:56] your strength
[1:48:57] friends it's not by might
[1:49:00] and it's not by power
[1:49:02] but it's by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:49:08] no I have been around for 52 almost 53
[1:49:12] years
[1:49:13] and I have seen a lot of things
[1:49:16] and I've seen the enemy steal away the
[1:49:19] spirit of God from people
[1:49:21] men of God that came out of Pentecostal
[1:49:24] denominations with the fire of God and
[1:49:28] they saw a truth that would transform
[1:49:31] them but rather than allowing the word
[1:49:35] and the spirit to mesh together
[1:49:38] they let go of the spirit and embrace
[1:49:42] the word
[1:49:44] and they're lifeless
[1:49:50] and I've seen on the other Spectrum
[1:49:54] they didn't whip it in a Pentecostal
[1:49:57] Church they came up to a pinnacle of
[1:50:00] their experience with speaking in
[1:50:02] tongues and that's all the further they
[1:50:04] went they did not go on into the
[1:50:06] fullness of the word and there they
[1:50:09] remain and they wonder why their
[1:50:11] churches are dying why the people are
[1:50:14] going back to the world because the
[1:50:17] mountains never melted together
[1:50:20] the word and the spirit
[1:50:25] but our God
[1:50:27] has given us the word
[1:50:29] and he gave us the spirit
[1:50:33] he doesn't give one and then decide he's
[1:50:36] going to change in the middle of the
[1:50:38] stream and take it away and give you
[1:50:40] something else
[1:50:42] my God gives to us everything that we
[1:50:46] need to make this Rapture and we're
[1:50:49] being raptured up into Heavenly places
[1:50:52] in Christ Jesus and he wants us to take
[1:50:56] the word that we have heard
[1:51:00] and he wants us to get in the spirit
[1:51:03] with the word that we have heard
[1:51:06] now sitting here and across that camera
[1:51:09] there are all kinds of levels of what we
[1:51:12] have heard and what we have experienced
[1:51:14] through the years the level of the
[1:51:16] understanding of God that we might have
[1:51:18] but God is calling us to take what we
[1:51:21] have in the understanding of the word
[1:51:24] and to allow the spirit to get upon it
[1:51:30] and make it live
[1:51:32] in our lives
[1:51:35] so that every time when we come together
[1:51:37] in the house of the Lord when we get in
[1:51:40] our secret place and we begin to call on
[1:51:42] the name of the Lord that word starts
[1:51:45] working and churning in US and that
[1:51:48] dimness of our eyes that we feel like
[1:51:50] that we have allowed our ego Vision to
[1:51:53] get a little clouded over if we'll allow
[1:51:56] the word and the spirit to start working
[1:51:58] together inside of our Lives then
[1:52:01] there's something that's going to
[1:52:02] transform us and our vision will become
[1:52:04] clearer and clearer and clearer now
[1:52:07] Samson was still down grinding every day
[1:52:11] around in a circle doing whatever he was
[1:52:14] doing grinding grinding grinding it was
[1:52:16] just the Daily Grind literally
[1:52:19] literally The Daily Grind
[1:52:22] and you may be sitting here tonight
[1:52:24] feeling that's the way life is for you
[1:52:29] I get up in the morning
[1:52:31] I go to work
[1:52:33] put in my eight or ten hours I come home
[1:52:38] supper
[1:52:39] a few things around the house go to bed
[1:52:42] get up and do it all over again tomorrow
[1:52:46] the enemy has lulled you into a Daily
[1:52:49] Grind and your vision has been clouded
[1:52:53] over
[1:52:55] but God has called us to a holy
[1:52:57] convocation
[1:53:00] during the Feast of Tabernacles he has
[1:53:03] called us to a holy convocation
[1:53:06] a set aside time that we could focus on
[1:53:10] getting out of the Daily Grind the Bible
[1:53:13] says that Samson was on this Daily Grind
[1:53:18] every day how be it
[1:53:21] his hair began to grow
[1:53:25] there came a day where Samson said I'm
[1:53:28] tired of sitting here
[1:53:31] God I'm sorry
[1:53:35] I'm sorry
[1:53:37] I know that I was the one that broke the
[1:53:40] Covenant
[1:53:41] [Music]
[1:53:42] but I feel the hair growing down my back
[1:53:46] once again and I am remembering your
[1:53:50] power your spirit coming upon me and I
[1:53:54] just want to lift my hands to you Lord
[1:53:56] and say if you can use me again I am
[1:54:00] yielding myself
[1:54:01] [Music]
[1:54:04] and there came a day
[1:54:07] that the Philistines
[1:54:09] decided that they were going to have a
[1:54:12] celebration
[1:54:18] I just insert here
[1:54:19] if the pagans can have celebrations why
[1:54:22] shouldn't the people of God celebrate
[1:54:27] why shouldn't we
[1:54:29] why shouldn't we dance and shout and run
[1:54:31] the aisles and speak in tongues and just
[1:54:34] have a good time and see the spirit of
[1:54:36] God come Among Us and just descend down
[1:54:38] upon us and do what he wants to do and
[1:54:40] shake some of us so far until that we're
[1:54:43] saying all that stuff that would have
[1:54:45] been held in US captive for too long
[1:54:46] it's we're just shaking loose of it
[1:54:51] Hallelujah
[1:54:53] Samson says Lord if you can use me again
[1:54:56] I'm yielding myself
[1:55:00] Philistines
[1:55:01] their holiday for Dagon comes along
[1:55:04] they're going to have a celebration
[1:55:07] they're going to make Mary they're going
[1:55:09] to drink they're going to celebrate
[1:55:10] they're going to celebrate their God's
[1:55:14] victory over their enemy Samson the one
[1:55:17] that has killed so many of our people
[1:55:19] we're going to celebrate that our God
[1:55:21] got victory over him and his God and he
[1:55:24] ain't going to kill our people no more
[1:55:26] we're going to celebrate
[1:55:30] don't ever underestimate God
[1:55:33] don't ever underminate the don't ever
[1:55:35] underestimate the Living God the creator
[1:55:37] of Heaven and Earth he's going to come
[1:55:39] when you least expect him if somebody
[1:55:42] invites him he's going to come and he's
[1:55:44] going to do Supernatural among you when
[1:55:46] it looks like everything is working out
[1:55:48] just exactly in the natural as it ought
[1:55:50] to be they're up there they're drinking
[1:55:52] their party and they're having a good
[1:55:53] time they're all decked out they're
[1:55:55] they're getting into the the mode of
[1:55:58] drunk because they're just they're just
[1:56:00] so happy that their God day God has
[1:56:03] overcome Samson and not realizing that
[1:56:06] uh Samson has already recognized that
[1:56:11] God is coming back upon him that he is
[1:56:14] repenting for what is in the past he's
[1:56:17] leaving it behind just the same as you
[1:56:19] can tonight if you've got some stuff in
[1:56:22] your life it doesn't take a big bunch of
[1:56:24] of span of time you can just say Lord I
[1:56:28] realize I've messed up I have messed up
[1:56:31] I came to the the altar on Sunday but
[1:56:35] I've messed up again now friends we
[1:56:37] don't want to condone repeat offenses
[1:56:42] we are looking for total Deliverance
[1:56:46] complete deliverance
[1:56:50] but every time that you can find and get
[1:56:53] yourself into the spirit of the Lord and
[1:56:56] you can say Lord I messed up again but
[1:56:59] I'm coming back to you because I don't
[1:57:00] know what else to do I I can't I I I'm
[1:57:04] coming in faith I can't fix myself I I
[1:57:08] mean I can make steps toward avoiding
[1:57:11] things but I can't fix myself I've got
[1:57:14] to have the spirit of God in my life in
[1:57:16] such a measure until that those things
[1:57:19] lose all of their grip they lose all of
[1:57:21] their taste they lose all of their
[1:57:23] wooing power to me I've got to get them
[1:57:26] out of my life and I just come back to
[1:57:28] you and that's what I urge every one of
[1:57:31] us to do every chance we get come back
[1:57:33] to God get in the spirit if there's an
[1:57:35] altar call if there's a gathering around
[1:57:37] the front if there's a Jericho March
[1:57:40] don't sit it out get right in the middle
[1:57:42] of it and say God I want you to do in me
[1:57:45] what can be done tonight I'm I'm getting
[1:57:48] right in the middle
[1:57:51] I'm getting in the middle of what you
[1:57:53] want to do because I don't want to be
[1:57:56] left on the sidelines while everybody
[1:57:57] else is getting what they're getting
[1:57:59] because God is moving this week
[1:58:03] he's moving he's here to help us he is
[1:58:06] here to strengthen us he's here to
[1:58:08] change us he's here to help us to
[1:58:10] overcome all of our past sins he said
[1:58:14] friends listen
[1:58:16] I know that the devil tends to beat us
[1:58:19] over our past
[1:58:22] it's what he enjoys doing he wants to
[1:58:25] beat you over your past but Paul says I
[1:58:30] leave it behind I'm forgetting those
[1:58:33] things that are behind and I'm pressing
[1:58:37] toward the mark for the prize of the
[1:58:40] high calling in Christ Jesus so I urge
[1:58:44] you to do as Paul did and that is to
[1:58:47] forget what is behind Samson could have
[1:58:50] been intimidated
[1:58:54] he had a lot of past
[1:58:57] he had a lot of yuck in his past he had
[1:59:01] a lot of disappointments in his past he
[1:59:04] had a lot of of times where that he
[1:59:07] failed God he had a lot of times where
[1:59:10] he failed his parents there were a lot
[1:59:12] of things in his past that he was
[1:59:15] probably ashamed of with his eyes poked
[1:59:18] out their grinding day after day after
[1:59:20] day but finally the Philistines gave
[1:59:24] opportunity
[1:59:25] they did not know it
[1:59:28] they did not know it
[1:59:31] but they wanted to make sport of Samson
[1:59:36] they said go get Samson
[1:59:39] go get him out of the grinding house
[1:59:41] let's give him a little change of pace
[1:59:44] bring him out here and let's just make a
[1:59:46] bit of fun of him the old blind thing
[1:59:53] yeah that blind guy down there you all
[1:59:55] see that's the one that he killed your
[1:59:58] cousins
[1:59:59] he killed your brothers he killed your
[2:00:02] mothers your fathers he can't look at
[2:00:05] him now we got him under control our God
[2:00:07] is one day gone one day gone one not
[2:00:12] realizing
[2:00:14] that there'd already been some
[2:00:16] repentance
[2:00:19] there'd already been some repentance on
[2:00:21] Samson's part
[2:00:23] and the locks of his hair were growing
[2:00:25] God was moving
[2:00:28] send him a little boy
[2:00:31] and he said Lord
[2:00:34] just one more time
[2:00:38] just one more time
[2:00:41] just one more time
[2:00:46] let me die with these Philistines
[2:00:50] they've poked my eyes out they've taken
[2:00:53] my life away from me
[2:00:55] but just one more time lord

[2:01:20] turned you away ah listen I'm not God

[2:19:29] to the heavens
[2:19:33] I lift my eyes just play that a moment
[2:19:37] just keep playing that
[2:19:40] I can't I can't hold back I can't no
[2:19:42] more I I have to do this now while the
[2:19:45] anointing of God is here
[2:19:47] now you know we all hear different
[2:19:49] things in these stories and there's no
[2:19:51] way in the world that you could preach
[2:19:53] at all
[2:19:54] the thing I love and admire about
[2:19:56] brother Greeley so much is he loves to
[2:19:59] give us the background of a story and I
[2:20:01] want to tell you something I've been
[2:20:02] studying the word of God a long time I
[2:20:05] forget these details
[2:20:06] and when he starts laying that out I
[2:20:09] know we're going somewhere
[2:20:11] so I just jump on right early
[2:20:14] I don't wait till it gets goody goody to
[2:20:17] jump in and help him I help him from the
[2:20:20] beginning because I know we're going
[2:20:22] somewhere
[2:20:23] I want to tell you two things and then
[2:20:25] then I want you to get what you need
[2:20:28] before we leave I want to tell you two
[2:20:30] things there is nothing in the Bible to
[2:20:33] tell us that Samson was a muscle-bound
[2:20:36] man
[2:20:39] you may see Schwarzenegger or you may
[2:20:41] see The Rock
[2:20:43] but I want you to know
[2:20:47] the children's made-up storybook
[2:20:50] that that portrays him as some Tony
[2:20:53] Atlas
[2:20:55] the Jews will tell you those who study
[2:20:58] the Hebrew scripture there was nothing
[2:21:00] about Samson that distinguished him in
[2:21:04] his physical appearance from anybody
[2:21:06] else except the long hair which was a
[2:21:08] Nazarite vowel
[2:21:10] in fact they say that he was rather
[2:21:13] ordered
[2:21:15] [Music]
[2:21:19] now I want to tell you something if you
[2:21:21] told me that I've got to transform
[2:21:23] myself
[2:21:24] into into the Rock
[2:21:28] foreign
[2:21:33] or a lifetime
[2:21:35] you are way I I don't I don't think I
[2:21:38] can I don't think I'll ever be that
[2:21:41] but I can be ordinary
[2:21:44] I can be what God made me then the
[2:21:48] strength was not his muscles
[2:21:51] it was the spirit of God that fell on
[2:21:53] him we are in it we're in a room tonight
[2:21:57] with ordinary people I don't want to
[2:22:00] offend you I just want you to know you
[2:22:03] are rather ordinary
[2:22:04] but you're not right you are but you're
[2:22:08] not because there's something that makes
[2:22:10] you different than those out there who
[2:22:13] are struggling and battling the way they
[2:22:15] battle the anointing is on your life the
[2:22:18] call of God is on your life and he's
[2:22:21] going to chase you
[2:22:24] because you're his
[2:22:26] you're never going to get away from God
[2:22:29] you're never going to be happy without
[2:22:31] him
[2:22:33] you're never going to be happy not doing
[2:22:35] what God has called you to do so you
[2:22:38] might as well surrender to him tonight
[2:22:41] don't wait till tomorrow night you might
[2:22:45] as well surrender to him tonight
[2:22:47] we're all ordinary
[2:22:49] but when that spirit of God falls on us
[2:22:53] we're Sons then
[2:22:55] not muscle bound just it was the
[2:22:57] strength of the and the second thing was
[2:22:59] this is always fascinated me and I
[2:23:03] wasn't going to say it I said it I
[2:23:04] talked it out loud you know me I talk
[2:23:06] when people are preaching but it's to
[2:23:08] help not to distract but I had a
[2:23:11] preacher who's streaming this service
[2:23:13] many states away
[2:23:15] who who made the comment sent me a text
[2:23:18] and confirmed what I was already stirred
[2:23:20] about it's this little verse right here
[2:23:23] verse 26 and Samson said unto the lad
[2:23:28] that held him by the hand
[2:23:32] all those months
[2:23:35] of being lonely
[2:23:37] of feeling like he was the only one
[2:23:40] the once champion of Israel now
[2:23:43] forgotten
[2:23:45] nobody's singing Samson's song anymore
[2:23:47] did you know they sung about him nobody
[2:23:50] was singing about Samson anymore eyes
[2:23:53] plucked out
[2:23:55] doing some menial little task some
[2:23:58] little insignificant task so lonely
[2:24:02] probably had only the little mice or
[2:24:05] some little creatures or something to
[2:24:07] give him any kind of companionship
[2:24:10] nobody to talk to nobody to tell your
[2:24:12] stories to nobody to to to share with
[2:24:16] you or to encourage you but God sent him
[2:24:18] help
[2:24:20] I want to tell you something I'm telling
[2:24:22] you in the name of the Lord God is
[2:24:24] sending you help tonight
[2:24:26] he's sending you help tonight he sent
[2:24:29] him a little lad
[2:24:31] he sent him a little boy just a young
[2:24:34] child who he could call on and he said
[2:24:37] suffer me that I may feel the pillars
[2:24:39] whereupon the house standeth that I may
[2:24:42] lean on them so this little boy that God
[2:24:45] sent the little lad that God sent to him
[2:24:47] took his arms and his hands and helped
[2:24:51] him find his position
[2:24:54] he had to find his place he lost his
[2:24:57] place he's blind he can't see it he
[2:25:01] can't even feel it but as soon as that
[2:25:03] little boy came and helped him and he
[2:25:06] put his hands around oh
[2:25:08] that familiar feeling that he'd been
[2:25:11] contemplating now for a few weeks as his
[2:25:14] hair was growing out I have to tell you
[2:25:17] tonight that God is sending somebody
[2:25:20] what about all of us why don't we just
[2:25:23] say every one of us your help is here
[2:25:26] God is sending you help so that you can
[2:25:30] get back to where you ought to be
[2:25:32] you hear what I'm saying I tell you that
[2:25:35] that cry out sister Terry cried out in
[2:25:38] the spirit and it went through me from
[2:25:41] the top of my head all the way down to
[2:25:43] my feet and I knew that also was a
[2:25:46] confirmation for me to tell you your
[2:25:48] help's here your help is here God has
[2:25:50] sent you hell
[2:25:52] now don't you refuse it and don't you
[2:25:55] reject it but but stick your feet under
[2:25:58] the table
[2:25:59] say Lord here I am I'm not satisfied
[2:26:03] doing nothing
[2:26:05] I'm not satisfied just getting by I need
[2:26:09] that anointing to follow my life I
[2:26:13] recognize that you are sending me help I
[2:26:16] want to get out from under this
[2:26:18] blindness I want to get out from this
[2:26:20] loneliness I want to get out from under
[2:26:23] this place of not belonging and not
[2:26:25] feeling like I have a part or a position
[2:26:28] in the body I've got to have a part of
[2:26:31] something
[2:26:33] you cry out to him because he's here
[2:26:36] he's here your freedom is here I want I
[2:26:40] want to give you that chance right now
[2:26:42] to do it right now as he sings again I
[2:26:46] want you to say I don't have to spend
[2:26:47] another day isolated and cut off from
[2:26:51] the body of Christ I don't have to spend
