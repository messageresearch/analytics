[0:11] we've got to help to pray these young
[0:13] people through to the Holy Ghost and
[0:15] that is really the the whole attitude of
[0:21] these youth camps is for young people to
[0:23] get an experience with the Lord that
[0:27] they'll never forget and that will keep
[0:29] them wolf from wandering away from from
[0:32] the Lord from the church but that will
[0:34] keep them strong through the years so
[0:38] the first time we went to Costa Rica was
[0:40] in 1996 with brother Mike Siebert
[0:44] he is the one that invited us to go on
[0:47] our very first missionary journey right
[0:50] and so that was the first time we were
[0:53] ever out of the country I had been to
[0:56] Canada before but never to leave the
[1:01] North American continent well he invited
[1:03] us to go along with brother Lindsey
[1:06] McGrady and his wife sister Sharon and
[1:08] several others and so when I found out
[1:12] that brother Lindsey McGrady was going
[1:15] again this year and I had not been for
[1:19] 24 years I thought this would be
[1:22] opportune time and this came about after
[1:26] the pastor we met him in the youth camp
[1:32] in Indiana this year this past year 2019
[1:36] and he invited us to come and so we
[1:42] prayed about it and it felt like that it
[1:45] was the right time for us to go and then
[1:47] Joyce said that she wanted to go and
[1:51] it's a beautiful country why not and so
[1:55] I began to talk to brother Lindsey and I
[1:58] said his sister Sharon going with you
[1:59] this time and he said well she wants to
[2:02] and so the Lord worked it out that our
[2:05] wives could go with us and of course a
[2:08] minister is better when he has his wife
[2:11] with him and so it was a great honor to
[2:14] take my wife with me and go back to
[2:18] Costa Rica after 24 years
[2:20] I think for a minister in many ways his
[2:22] wife is home and after he goes and he
[2:25] pours himself out preaching and you know
[2:27] afterwards the enemy is always going to
[2:29] attack with questions and with doubts
[2:32] and and you know did you do your best or
[2:35] did you save this that you shouldn't
[2:37] have said whatever but having somebody
[2:38] that you're so confident in their loving
[2:41] and somebody that's very familiar to you
[2:43] with you is a very big help and I
[2:45] believe that if there had been no other
[2:47] reason for me and sister Sharon to go
[2:50] that that would have been sufficient but
[2:52] I believe that the Lord used us in so
[2:56] much more than that
[2:58] believers youth camp which stemmed from
[3:02] the believers youth camp here in the
[3:05] States brother Mike Siebert is the one
[3:09] who was instrumental in starting
[3:10] believers youth camp in 1982 I believe
[3:15] he and brother John la Fontaine started
[3:18] the first youth camp in West Milton Ohio
[3:21] and now all these years later that
[3:25] campground we could no longer use it so
[3:29] it got moved to Indiana and then the
[3:33] leadership was turned to brother Mike's
[3:35] son Douglas but somewhere in the course
[3:40] of those years brother Mike felt the
[3:42] burden to go to foreign countries and
[3:45] start a youth camp in other countries
[3:50] and I think that the one in Costa Rica
[3:54] in 1996 was the first one and out of it
[3:58] was born believers youth camp
[4:01] International
[4:04] brother mike has gone to many of the
[4:08] Central and South American countries to
[4:11] hold these youth camps and what he tries
[4:15] to do is go and establish with a local
[4:19] pastor in one of these countries and he
[4:23] helps to support it he desires for the
[4:28] kids to be hungry enough for the Lord
[4:31] that they want to be able to pay a fee
[4:35] to help to pay for the camp or a local
[4:38] church to be desirous enough for their
[4:42] young people to be filled with the Holy
[4:43] Ghost to have a move of God that they'll
[4:46] pitch in and help with the youth camp
[4:48] and so I've been with brother Mike in
[4:53] Costa Rica I've been with him in
[4:57] Nicaragua he sent us as a family to
[5:00] Honduras in 2007 I went to Venezuela
[5:05] with him in 2009 and I have been with
[5:10] him in India five times for these youth
[5:15] camps and so he has poured his life into
[5:23] taking the the desire for young people
[5:29] to have their own experience with the
[5:32] Lord where that they're not relying on
[5:35] their parents experience or their
[5:36] pastors experience but that there would
[5:41] be a genuine move of God where that
[5:44] these young people would really seek for
[5:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost for
[5:49] themselves I can remember when we went
[5:52] to Costa Rica in 1996 it was a foreign
[5:59] thought to them to go and kneel around
[6:04] the altar and it was the same way in
[6:07] India it took several years for them to
[6:11] have this concept that I can go and I
[6:15] can pray
[6:16] until that I know that I know that I
[6:19] have received the baptism of the Holy
[6:21] Ghost and the other issue that we have
[6:24] dealt with in these foreign countries is
[6:27] to try to get those that already have
[6:30] the Holy Ghost to come and to pray with
[6:33] these young people they feel like that
[6:36] that's the preachers job well in some of
[6:39] these countries we can't even get the
[6:40] preachers to help us to come and pray
[6:42] whoever did the preaching can do the
[6:45] praying too but as the years have
[6:47] progressed and we go year after year
[6:51] after year now we can get the preachers
[6:54] that are in the building to help us to
[6:56] pray those that already have the Holy
[6:58] Ghost even the the mothers and
[7:01] grandmothers we're seeing more and more
[7:03] that they really have have noticed in in
[7:08] the world the falling away and so it's
[7:11] like it provokes them we've got to help
[7:13] to pray these young people through to
[7:15] the Holy Ghost and that is really the
[7:19] the whole attitude of these youth camps
[7:23] is for young people to get an experience
[7:26] with the Lord that they'll never forget
[7:29] and that will keep them wolf from
[7:31] wandering away from from the Lord from
[7:33] the church but that will keep them
[7:35] strong through the years and I don't
[7:38] think that you can measure the fruit of
[7:42] the youth camp while you're there no Wes
[7:47] gave his heart to the Lord in a youth
[7:50] camp in 1988 the pastor to the church
[7:56] that invited us said that he received
[7:58] the Holy Ghost at the at one of the
[8:01] previous youth camps in Costa Rica and
[8:04] if you had every testimony of everything
[8:07] like that and like one of the young men
[8:11] that it kind of touched me he had only
[8:14] been to the service of the church that
[8:17] that
[8:18] youth camp twice hit someone had
[8:21] recently invited him he had come twice
[8:23] and then they'd invited him to come to
[8:27] the youth camp and when he arrived he
[8:30] was not dressed in appropriate attire
[8:32] and they told him I said that you know
[8:34] you're gonna have to wear pants and and
[8:36] he said well I only have one pair but
[8:38] okay and so he wore his one pair but
[8:41] every night at the altar well I think we
[8:44] said actually in every service at the
[8:46] altar last morning and evening morning
[8:48] and evening that there was a puddle of
[8:50] tears around him you know someone who
[8:52] was totally unchurched who didn't really
[8:54] know the Lord at all and so desperately
[8:57] hungry to connect with the Lord how do
[9:01] you measure that fruit and then a young
[9:05] lady from a home that was split up and
[9:08] and if she lived with her mother or
[9:09] there was always tension because her
[9:10] mother was angry
[9:11] her dad was angry that she's staying
[9:13] with her mother if she stayed with her
[9:14] dad her mom was always angry she and it
[9:17] was always such turmoil in our life and
[9:20] she had sent the pastor a note and said
[9:23] I'm just not coming back to church but
[9:25] she came on to the youth camp and and
[9:29] then she's been in the services since
[9:32] then and seems to be she got now can't
[9:38] think of a word in English for it but
[9:40] you know if I guess of a revival within
[9:41] her to give her the encouragement to
[9:44] press on and to push on in and to make
[9:47] it how do you measure how do you measure
[9:49] that
[9:49] that fruit because I've watched it over
[9:54] and over again how that one wrong
[9:56] decision couldn't take you out of the
[9:59] path and keep you out of the path for
[10:01] years and years and so what if she had
[10:03] stuck with that decision she made on
[10:05] December the 31st and just hadn't ever
[10:08] but now you know that course has been
[10:11] corrected and I know she'll have the
[10:13] opportunity to make that choice again
[10:14] because we continue to come to cross
[10:16] word roads but to give somebody a lift
[10:19] and encouragement to press into the
[10:22] correct
[10:23] path you can't measure that kind of
[10:26] fruit we flew into San Jose currently
[10:30] it's supposed to be summer it's nearer
[10:32] to the equator than we are obviously and
[10:35] it was it was just under 70 degrees
[10:40] Fahrenheit when we got there down in the
[10:43] little town we stayed Grecia and then
[10:47] when we went up on the mountain it had
[10:49] started raining and when it started
[10:52] raining and we got way up on the
[10:55] mountain the wind was also blowing and
[10:57] it felt like winter it was very cold the
[11:02] the camp was a total of six meetings
[11:05] three morning three evening started on
[11:08] Wednesday night ended on Saturday
[11:10] morning I did all of the evening
[11:13] meetings and brother Lindsay did all of
[11:15] the morning meetings and generally the
[11:18] the evening meetings are kind of
[11:21] evangelistic services and the morning
[11:23] meetings are more kind of teaching
[11:27] services this time it was kind of
[11:31] switched around where it seemed like
[11:33] that the morning meetings were
[11:35] evangelistic and the evening meetings
[11:37] were more teaching after you do a bunch
[11:41] of these meetings and you kind of get a
[11:43] feel for the people that are in them and
[11:46] you find out that they're facing the
[11:49] same battles that everybody is facing
[11:52] and you not only want to help them and
[11:57] encourage them to receive the baptism of
[12:00] the Holy Ghost but you want to give them
[12:01] some practical teaching that will help
[12:05] them day to day because so many people
[12:08] when they encounter a battle or they
[12:13] trip and fall over something then
[12:16] immediately the the enemy wants to say
[12:18] you don't have the Holy Ghost
[12:20] which I don't think is at all true you
[12:24] you just learned that these kids really
[12:27] just need some basic rubber meets the
[12:31] road kind of teaching to help them in
[12:34] the daily overcoming even for people
[12:38] that have the Holy Ghost you everybody
[12:41] has mine battles everybody is going to
[12:44] encounter something that they trip over
[12:47] and and rather than staying down and and
[12:50] and having everybody kick you as they go
[12:52] by it just find a place to ask the Lord
[12:58] to forgive you and get back up and go
[13:00] again although this was a very small
[13:04] youth camp what did they say 50 campers
[13:08] actually probably four it was very small
[13:13] but there was representation from Costa
[13:16] Rica Nicaragua Honduras Panama and all
[13:25] of these people traveled in to be able
[13:28] to come to this camp the Panamanian
[13:31] people got stuck at the border of Panama
[13:35] and Costa Rica there was one of the
[13:40] girls that didn't have her proper
[13:42] paperwork and they sat at the border for
[13:45] ten hours waiting for that child's
[13:48] parents to bring the necessary paperwork
[13:51] so that she could get across the border
[13:52] to be a part of that youth camp and so
[13:55] before the youth camp forever started
[13:58] there was fighting in the spirit realm
[14:01] to be able to get these children to the
[14:06] youth camp something that impressed the
[14:09] the people in Costa Rica very much was
[14:13] the fact that our lives would pray with
[14:16] the ladies around the altar they had
[14:19] never seen that before or it was
[14:21] something that was that was very
[14:22] uncommon for them to see and it was a
[14:25] great blessing to for them to see our
[14:28] wives praying with people around the
[14:31] altar and not just the preachers the
[14:33] first
[14:33] that was was preaching and we stood up
[14:38] at the end I was next to sister Sharon
[14:40] and I noticed this young lady that was
[14:41] in front of me to my right just sobbing
[14:44] and that's kind of nudge Sharon she kind
[14:47] of glanced at me like what are you doing
[14:49] in this reverent moment nudging me and
[14:51] then I just kind of nudged toward you
[14:53] know pointed toward the girl that was
[14:54] crying and so then when he actually made
[14:57] the altar call Sharon stepped up with
[15:00] her and begin to pray with her and then
[15:03] I went on up to the altar to pray and
[15:06] the girl later poured out her heart to
[15:09] Sharon and she had been away from the
[15:12] Lord not coming to church hurt and like
[15:15] all hurt she had a lot of good reasons
[15:17] to be hurt but you know every time we
[15:20] hurt we have a choice of a response we
[15:23] don't have to run anywhere but to the
[15:27] Lord but so often we want to run away
[15:30] from what we perceive to be the source
[15:33] of the pain and so she had completely
[15:36] gone out she was doing her party thing
[15:39] and even the the weekend before she was
[15:42] at a party she was telling Sharon about
[15:44] it and she said to a young man at the
[15:47] party I've been invited to this
[15:48] Christian camp next week and he said why
[15:53] don't you go she said he looked at her
[15:56] and he said you don't belong here
[16:00] I mean how shocking for that and so then
[16:04] she went through this series of well
[16:06] okay maybe I can got off from work yes
[16:08] you can get off from work and then they
[16:10] come back and say no you can't we've got
[16:11] too much and we depend on you too much
[16:13] and you can't and then she was like okay
[16:16] you know because she didn't have her
[16:17] heart committed to coming at all and she
[16:20] never in her mind she never saw herself
[16:22] coming back to church and serving the
[16:24] Lord again although her mother had been
[16:27] persistently praying for her and telling
[16:29] her that she was then they said well you
[16:32] if you work an extra hour every day
[16:34] so-and-so has agreed to take your place
[16:36] for the for the rest of the time so that
[16:39] opened up the door for her to come and
[16:41] she said well I don't have a way that's
[16:42] you know a good good ways out of San
[16:45] Jose and I don't have a car to drive and
[16:46] then another friend said oh well I have
[16:49] to go right by there I'll just take and
[16:50] drop you off as I Drive and when she got
[16:54] out of the car her other friends said to
[16:55] her you're never gonna be the same after
[16:59] this
[17:00] and she she told Sharon and that she
[17:06] said I don't ever cry and she said in
[17:08] here I've sobbed through the entire
[17:10] sermon and then she told me later she
[17:12] said I kept expecting him to call me by
[17:17] name she said it was so real and so
[17:20] individual for me I thought he was going
[17:22] to speak my name from the pulpit that
[17:24] shows that the Lord is just using us as
[17:27] a vessel it's not of us there's nothing
[17:29] that we're doing and I think to me
[17:30] that's probably the most special thing
[17:33] about it all the ability to get
[17:37] ourselves out of the way and let the
[17:39] Lord do the work through us that is
[17:41] beyond amazing to me so every every
[17:45] service really built one on another
[17:50] talking to the kids about getting things
[17:53] out of their life really talking about
[17:56] the soul realm and of course receiving
[18:01] the Holy Ghost and then maintaining what
[18:04] you've got and and allowing the Holy
[18:06] Spirit to build on that and and not
[18:10] letting it deplete out of your life and
[18:14] every service there were kids in the
[18:17] altar you didn't have to beg them to
[18:19] come to the altar and pray they well
[18:21] even in their seat they they would stand
[18:24] and weep in the presence of the Lord at
[18:27] the end of the service but as as they
[18:32] were finishing praying there came a
[18:35] sound of victory at the end and they
[18:39] didn't want to leave they did young
[18:41] people didn't want well the older people
[18:42] didn't either and that that's they
[18:44] stayed in there and you know some of the
[18:46] ones who start drifting out but a huge
[18:48] group of them just kept singing and and
[18:51] worshiping and praising and it was it
[18:55] was absolutely beautiful and you know
[18:57] what you could feel the love and the
[18:59] unity we did all sorts of neat little
[19:03] children's product projects and you'll
[19:05] find a little video of a girl with
[19:06] beautiful hair out to here but she's
[19:09] telling the story of the five loaves and
[19:12] two fish in Spanish and she does it just
[19:15] she does a beautiful job but they they
[19:18] did a little crafts that matched with
[19:20] the stories that they were studying with
[19:21] and then I had the two to five year olds
[19:24] that I was working with and that was
[19:26] just pure entertainment
[19:28] we had morning service we had evening
[19:30] service and in the afternoon they had
[19:32] activities which I love they had the
[19:35] first day brother layman who would work
[19:39] kind of like a youth pastor
[19:41] and and he did what he called icebreaker
[19:44] activities he was so good with them
[19:47] every single person was involved he
[19:49] divided them into four teams course guys
[19:51] hunt teams girls on teams which it's
[19:54] kind of not the fairest thing in the
[19:55] world when you're playing relay races
[19:57] but anyway the girls held their own on
[20:00] them but he stopped he started out with
[20:03] him in a circle and and they he I don't
[20:06] know what he was saying I was up on the
[20:07] hill I wasn't close enough to try to
[20:09] figure out you know get the serious
[20:10] voice and they were all standing up and
[20:11] they were role in their hands and they
[20:12] were bending down the role in their
[20:14] hands you know what he said that was
[20:15] just a loosening up exercise and then
[20:18] then he had all the girls to put their
[20:20] arms around each other and all the guys
[20:22] and then I don't know what he was saying
[20:25] to get them to do this but it's great
[20:27] you sit on the video he had them humping
[20:29] in a circle this way and then hopping in
[20:31] the circle that way but you know how
[20:32] difficult it is when you're different
[20:34] heights and different and you've got
[20:36] your arms on somebody else in your half
[20:37] and it was great I mean they were all
[20:38] just busting their guts laughing and and
[20:41] then a real life where the guys on one
[20:44] team the girls on one team and they had
[20:45] a balloon and they had to the person in
[20:48] the back passed it all the way up to the
[20:50] person in the front hand over hand
[20:52] and the first in the front come running
[20:53] around and you know like that will you
[20:56] know balloons are not very steady things
[20:57] and the balloon would go flying off and
[20:59] they'd have to get chasing after it and
[21:00] Stefan just laughter and laughter and
[21:04] laughter and now you're there with
[21:06] people you don't know because they're
[21:07] from another country they don't go to
[21:08] your church and you're pulling with them
[21:11] because you're trying you're trying to
[21:13] make your unit your unit your team win
[21:17] and so I think although that was not
[21:20] necessarily spiritual it was spiritual
[21:23] you know any time that we're doing
[21:26] something that's pulling us together in
[21:27] a unity that honors the Lord I think
[21:30] that it that it's a wonderful thing and
[21:33] then but in a second they broke into
[21:35] small groups in which they actually just
[21:38] had discussions a the leader and their
[21:41] small group would bring up something and
[21:45] then you don't want you get one topic
[21:47] going and just having group discussions
[21:50] amongst young people about things that
[21:52] were troubling them or
[21:55] causing them to struggle or that they
[21:56] had questions or they didn't understand
[21:58] and so I found that was beautiful there
[22:02] was an older brother not ancient there
[22:07] was an older brother and you see here my
[22:09] color yeah he was in the meeting 24
[22:17] years ago a very talented singer very
[22:21] and I have a memory of him singing to
[22:29] God be the glory
[22:30] and it just amazing he sings it in
[22:34] Spanish of course but in the building
[22:38] the church building it reverberated off
[22:40] of the walls it was I just have this
[22:43] memory of it when we saw him he helped
[22:47] to get us to the camp it was very quiet
[22:50] very reserved almost like he was
[22:53] depressed and it took several meetings I
[23:01] think it was Friday before that he even
[23:06] would acknowledge that he would sing but
[23:10] he started singing on Friday night and
[23:18] one of the when I when I took Spanish
[23:21] when she was teaching it one of the
[23:23] things that she insisted was that I
[23:25] learned some songs and so I learned
[23:28] Amazing Grace and okay How Great Thou
[23:32] art in Spanish and when I was in
[23:36] Venezuela in 2009 God used it in a
[23:39] supernatural way but I sang just the
[23:43] course before I preached on Friday night
[23:46] well after the service on Friday night
[23:48] they started singing it again and this
[23:51] brother got up there with the microphone
[23:53] and he started singing and singing and
[23:56] singing it was just like the well came
[23:59] uncapped and and and his depression
[24:02] lifted and Saturday again
[24:05] he sang some more and and when that when
[24:09] the service ended on Saturday morning he
[24:12] sang for another hour after the service
[24:14] ended just the people singing and
[24:18] rejoicing and dancing and happy and
[24:20] joyful because that the Lord had been so
[24:23] good and showed up and moved in and so
[24:26] it wasn't just for the youth and then
[24:28] Sunday morning he sang a special in
[24:31] their church but the pastor said that
[24:34] that Friday night was the first time
[24:36] that he had sung in public since he'd
[24:38] come back to the Lord
[24:40] [Music]
[24:53] and so I really believe the Lord made a
[24:56] breakthrough for him then he invited all
[24:59] of us up to his beautiful house upon a
[25:03] different mountain and and at the end of
[25:07] the evening they sang you know Sharon
[25:13] Sharon played the piano and sister
[25:15] Andrea the pastor's daughter daughter
[25:17] played the piano both of them probably
[25:20] sang for two hours at night oh heavens
[25:22] no I think we sang for four
[25:23] [Laughter]
[25:27] [Music]
[25:34] I felt the supernatural nasaw this trip
[25:38] in every way to start with I've had a
[25:42] prophetic word from the Lord for many
[25:45] years well 20 years that the Lord gave
[25:51] me an anointing for the people of
[25:54] Central and South America and though I
[25:58] have been a couple of times and to
[26:02] Central and South America I never really
[26:06] felt like that that was the time and I
[26:10] feel like that this is the time you know
[26:17] where that there's already an open
[26:19] invitation back with with a tentative
[26:23] time and a tentative reason for coming
[26:26] back because this brother has a desire
[26:30] to not just build his church bigger but
[26:34] for there to be six to ten churches in
[26:41] Costa Rica because right now he said he
[26:44] only knows three or four there's five
[26:46] five messages and what he wants to those
[26:50] five are not all in fellowship he wants
[26:52] to met he doesn't want to build a large
[26:56] Church he would rather have several
[26:57] smaller churches and then them come
[27:00] together for fellowship meetings but he
[27:02] wants to start this outreach to start
[27:06] presenting the gospel to them but I feel
[27:09] like that this time was significant
[27:11] because of reconnection and the real
[27:17] one-on-one fellowship with the pastor
[27:21] and see in his heart his desire to out
[27:26] to reach out to other people outside of
[27:29] the four walls of his church and to to
[27:35] have us to come back and and not only
[27:37] that what I see in this pastor is a
[27:40] heart too
[27:42] Norrish or groom other ministers you
[27:48] know and this is not gonna sound like an
[27:50] applause but really if you think about
[27:51] it does you know when charity would look
[27:53] at her daddy says I'm what husband
[27:55] that's just like daddy and I said
[27:57] charity you cannot this is a few years
[27:59] ago obviously I said you can't expect a
[28:03] 19 year old boy to act like a 40 year
[28:06] old man I said daddy didn't act like
[28:09] daddy does now 20 years ago and the same
[28:14] thing is I think sometimes it can be
[28:16] easy for a pastor as he begins to step
[28:20] into his own maturity to look up at the
[28:22] up-and-coming ones and think well he
[28:26] doesn't have that the maturity to lead
[28:29] but I see him taking those that don't
[28:32] have his maturity but putting them in
[28:36] positions of responsibility and respect
[28:39] which i think is so essential if a man
[28:42] doesn't feel respected he doesn't act
[28:45] respected or respectable you know to a
[28:48] certain extent and I see him putting
[28:50] these people that are still growing of
[28:53] course they're still growing you don't
[28:57] get 20 year-olds really that have the
[29:00] maturity because life teaches you that
[29:03] that somebody that's 40 or 50 has and I
[29:07] really appreciate that I see that yeah
[29:10] he doesn't want to wait til that they're
[29:11] full-grown before what's in both the
[29:15] music ministry and into the teaching
[29:17] ministry I would say I really respect
[29:21] that about him then the brother from
[29:24] Honduras who came to help with the
[29:26] interpreting he interpreted on Friday
[29:30] night for us brother Paco he is from
[29:33] Honduras
[29:33] he is the one who has been going to the
[29:37] jungles of Honduras and Nicaragua and
[29:43] preaching to these people the importance
[29:48] of salvation through Jesus Christ their
[29:51] their Catholic people steeped in the
[29:53] Catholic Church any any
[29:55] that they have is of the Catholic nature
[29:58] and they like there are poor people if
[30:03] they get any help it comes through the
[30:05] Catholic Church so if they leave the
[30:08] Catholic Church it's a hot cost to them
[30:10] and so if they plant their grain and
[30:13] they have a bad year and they don't have
[30:15] anybody then the Catholic Church gives
[30:17] seed to although the Catholics but you
[30:19] can't have any because you're not a part
[30:20] of our church so it's a high cost it's
[30:23] the people leave the Catholic Church he
[30:26] is going to these people and presenting
[30:28] the gospel as well as the message to
[30:32] them to try to get as many of them to
[30:38] understand and be born again by the
[30:41] Spirit of the Lord and so he is going
[30:44] into the jungle of Honduras as well as
[30:48] across the river in Nicaragua and these
[30:52] are extremely poor people and they there
[30:58] is a pastor in in a little village who
[31:01] helps him and he also does some of the
[31:04] travelling but it is it is very remote
[31:08] very difficult they don't even have
[31:11] outhouses they this this brother our
[31:16] interpreter he went to one little place
[31:19] and he asked the lady where's the toilet
[31:22] and her answer was sold so the whole
[31:26] essence of this trip was not just about
[31:29] the youth
[31:31] that was just the avenue to get us there
[31:33] but I believe that it was a much broader
[31:36] spectrum of reconnecting with this
[31:40] pastor with the outreach that he wants
[31:43] to do and then our interpreter and the
[31:45] outreach that he is doing the mission
[31:47] work that he's doing and reconnecting
[31:51] with him because I have not seen him
[31:52] since I was in Nicaragua in 2009 and so
[31:58] it was great to reconnect with him and
[32:01] to such an feel his heart
[32:04] you know the heartbeat of what what he
[32:06] is after because although he is a
[32:09] preacher and has a local pastor his
[32:13] heart is for these people in the jungle
[32:16] of Honduras and Nicaragua you when you
[32:18] talk to him you can just tell this is he
[32:21] would rather be there then to even have
[32:24] been with us where that he had a nice
[32:27] bed and plenty of food he there were
[32:29] there something that was drawing him
[32:31] back to the to the mission work but you
[32:35] could tell he has no personal ambition
[32:37] and and you you watch a man like that
[32:39] and I'm telling you it's like that's the
[32:43] man in heaven that's gonna be exalted
[32:45] it's just you know hit the humility that
[32:48] he carries
[32:52] [Music]
[33:02] please or something but if you can gold
[33:05] you can help send somebody else to see
[33:08] Thanks what you do to send somebody else
[33:13] [Music]
[33:15] ah spits Holy Ghost hardly Bible that
[33:19] what happened no stop it
[33:21] who's going out into the jungle gun it
[33:22] and do something for God instead of
[33:25] building five churches about our chai
[33:27] the neighbors
