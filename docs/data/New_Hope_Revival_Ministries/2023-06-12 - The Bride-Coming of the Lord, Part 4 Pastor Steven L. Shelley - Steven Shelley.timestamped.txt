[47:10] Nathan's been after me to sing this song
[47:12] for
[47:14] I don't know a year and a half I found
[47:16] it during the last period of carrying
[47:18] Edith and for those of you who don't
[47:20] know I dealt with a tremendous amount of
[47:23] anxiety and fear during her
[47:27] journey to Earth
[47:28] and um when the Lord revealed that to me
[47:32] the other night
[47:33] that I had let fear pretty much
[47:36] weave its way into about every aspect of
[47:39] my life I was really shocked because I
[47:41] never would have thought of myself as a
[47:42] fearful person
[47:45] I was seeing too many miracles
[47:48] I've seen God move
[47:51] in such Supernatural ways that
[47:54] doctors stood in absolute awe I've seen
[48:00] that they had to come back to life I was
[48:02] seen
[48:04] The Impossible made possible and yet I
[48:07] was still sitting there in my little
[48:09] boat really afraid to get out and walk
[48:12] on the water because I can't swim
[48:17] and the Lord just really been dealing
[48:19] with gentle way lately and he just said
[48:22] you know me
[48:24] so stop focusing on what you can't do
[48:27] and start focusing on what I can do and
[48:30] that's what this song is about

[1:00:28] you worked hard to create an atmosphere
[1:00:31] this morning don't let it slip away from

[1:00:40] oh he's wonderful
[1:00:43] he's wonderful
[1:00:46] you may be seated
[1:00:48] 90 years ago today
[1:00:52] brother Branham was standing in the
[1:00:54] middle of the Ohio River
[1:00:56] baptizing
[1:00:58] hundreds of people who had come there
[1:01:01] were hundreds of people who were
[1:01:03] witnessing that baptism on the banks of
[1:01:06] the Ohio River
[1:01:08] when brother Branham came to the 17th
[1:01:10] person
[1:01:11] and there was a light that came down out
[1:01:14] of Heaven many Saw the Light
[1:01:16] but there were those who said they heard
[1:01:19] the voice many say it said that they saw
[1:01:22] the light and didn't hear the voice some
[1:01:25] said they heard the voice and didn't see
[1:01:26] the light that sounds like the book of
[1:01:29] Acts
[1:01:30] but there was a voice that spoke out of
[1:01:32] heaven and said as John the Baptist was
[1:01:35] sent to forerun the first coming of the
[1:01:38] Lord Jesus your message will forerun his
[1:01:42] second coming
[1:01:43] so we believe that we are in the season
[1:01:46] of the second coming of the Lord we're
[1:01:49] in the season
[1:01:51] of the second coming of the Lord so
[1:01:53] today is a is an interesting day to
[1:01:55] think about those things that was in
[1:01:57] 1933 did I get that right is 33 and 20
[1:02:02] 23 90 years
[1:02:04] and that's quite old
[1:02:06] there are very few people if any
[1:02:10] that were there that day
[1:02:12] still alive
[1:02:15] if you think about it
[1:02:17] even brother Billy Paul wasn't born in
[1:02:19] 33 was he no
[1:02:21] he was born in 35.
[1:02:24] and so very few people if any were there
[1:02:27] who saw that with their own eyes
[1:02:29] are still alive today but I am a witness
[1:02:32] how can you be a witness if you didn't
[1:02:35] see it because I believe it
[1:02:37] I believe it there are many things about
[1:02:40] this message that I don't understand
[1:02:42] but I believe it
[1:02:45] I believe it I believe it I believe it I
[1:02:48] want to do what he said do if you come
[1:02:50] across it and you don't understand it he
[1:02:52] said you just leave it sitting there
[1:02:55] you just put it on a shelf and you just
[1:02:57] leave it there until the understanding
[1:02:59] comes I've prayed all morning I've
[1:03:01] prayed all morning that understanding
[1:03:03] would come to this service that your
[1:03:06] eyes would be Anointed with I Salve and
[1:03:09] that you would leave here today with a
[1:03:11] deeper revelation of this truth than you
[1:03:14] have ever had before
[1:03:15] it is the truth I don't care what Google
[1:03:18] says
[1:03:20] it is the truth it's Vindicated by the
[1:03:22] Lord Jesus Christ and it's it's the
[1:03:25] Preparatory message for the bride it's
[1:03:27] getting us ready
[1:03:29] and I'm thankful for that today I want
[1:03:32] to say this before it slips my mind you
[1:03:35] people are going to have a week when
[1:03:38] that podcast comes out you're going to
[1:03:41] want to sit down and watch it all at one
[1:03:43] time because it is a tremendous podcast
[1:03:48] that was taped here on was it Thursday
[1:03:51] or Friday
[1:03:53] Thursday afternoon it was absolutely
[1:03:56] outstanding Joshua interviewed Hawk and
[1:04:01] Hawk gave his testimony of coming to the
[1:04:03] Lord
[1:04:04] and there was such a presence
[1:04:07] oh thank you Jesus
[1:04:10] I was a few minutes late getting out
[1:04:13] here I was in a session with someone and
[1:04:15] was a few minutes late getting out here
[1:04:17] I found it so hard to sit in the Pew and
[1:04:20] turn my neck that way for long
[1:04:22] Benjamin so delicately quietly he's not
[1:04:26] usually delicate or quiet
[1:04:28] but delicately and quietly he got me a
[1:04:30] chair and put it over here in the aisle
[1:04:32] and I was able to watch it I couldn't
[1:04:34] help myself my hands kept going up I
[1:04:38] couldn't help myself to hear what a
[1:04:41] transformation God has worked in Hawk's
[1:04:44] life
[1:04:45] for his glory there were things that I
[1:04:48] had heard before and there were things
[1:04:50] that I had never heard before and then
[1:04:53] at the end of it there was such a
[1:04:55] wonderful presence of the Lord that came
[1:04:57] as they prayed and I know I don't uh
[1:05:00] hope and anticipate with just hope I
[1:05:03] know that there will be many many
[1:05:06] people's lives changed touched
[1:05:09] encouraged strengthened because of that
[1:05:12] podcast so I want to thank them both and
[1:05:15] Joshua is coming to his own God is
[1:05:18] really using him and it was it was
[1:05:22] [Applause]
[1:05:26] foreign
[1:05:27] [Applause]
[1:05:30] to experience it and I know we don't
[1:05:33] have an exact date of its uh uh of its
[1:05:37] release but it will be released this
[1:05:38] week and and I just know you're going to
[1:05:41] be touched so you that are streaming the
[1:05:42] service watch for it and share it like
[1:05:46] it
[1:05:47] Heart It
[1:05:48] share it comment on it because every
[1:05:52] time you do that you send it to a new
[1:05:55] place in the algorithm and that means
[1:05:58] more people will randomly see it that
[1:06:01] would have never seen it before the more
[1:06:03] action it gets on it haven't you said
[1:06:06] that before
[1:06:08] I'm gonna say it again the more action
[1:06:11] it gets
[1:06:12] the more reaction that you have to it
[1:06:15] you should comment you should like it
[1:06:18] you should share it and by doing so you
[1:06:21] will reach people it may not sound like
[1:06:23] much to you but it's been a long journey
[1:06:25] to get us here and yesterday we reached
[1:06:28] 6 000 followers on Facebook for the
[1:06:30] ministry page six thousand that's pretty
[1:06:33] outstanding
[1:06:35] foreign
[1:06:37] we have passed many of our friends in
[1:06:40] Ministry and it's not a competition by
[1:06:42] any means it has taken a long time to
[1:06:46] get to this place where our presence is
[1:06:49] so widely known on Facebook on Instagram
[1:06:52] and uh on uh what else is it uh YouTube
[1:06:57] uh it's taken a long time to get to this
[1:07:00] place where new people because of your
[1:07:03] reactions because of your comments
[1:07:04] because of your shares now people who
[1:07:07] have no connection to any of us are now
[1:07:09] getting it in their feeds so it's you
[1:07:12] you're the one sending it out there and
[1:07:15] uh and God is using it I have had tons
[1:07:19] of personal comments back to me through
[1:07:22] Messenger uh on my private Facebook page
[1:07:27] concerning the clip that has was
[1:07:29] released this week of uh sister Megan
[1:07:33] yovich's song I Wish somebody's Soul
[1:07:35] would catch on fire and there was such
[1:07:38] an anointing that comes it comes through
[1:07:40] the speaker it comes through the device
[1:07:44] I weep every time I watch it it's
[1:07:48] transferable anointing
[1:07:50] and the people are feeling it and people
[1:07:53] are coming and reaching out and asking
[1:07:55] me to be connected with them in in
[1:07:57] Facebook and as soon as I say yes here's
[1:08:00] their comments they say it takes me back
[1:08:02] to my childhood that's the fire that
[1:08:04] used to be in the church
[1:08:07] on YouTube a brother I think one of one
[1:08:09] of the one of the platforms your brother
[1:08:11] reaches out and said we need that all
[1:08:13] over South Africa
[1:08:15] we need that
[1:08:17] and uh I I was watching a YouTube uh
[1:08:21] clip or video this week of another
[1:08:23] ministering brother in the message and I
[1:08:26] was so blessed he's taken a very
[1:08:28] unpopular stand against the
[1:08:31] um against the Press Play and Obey
[1:08:34] movement and uh that movement that
[1:08:37] desires to take the pulpit uh from the
[1:08:41] fivefold ministry and give it to a tape
[1:08:43] recorder and uh he's made such an
[1:08:46] outstanding and Brave and Bold stand
[1:08:49] against that movement I usually just
[1:08:51] anonymously watch
[1:08:55] but I couldn't do that this week I found
[1:08:58] one that was so strikingly poignant that
[1:09:01] I had to comment on it and his comment
[1:09:05] back to me was to thank us for our
[1:09:07] ministry to the former Amish Brethren
[1:09:09] who he is also in contact with and he
[1:09:12] said to update you from a few years back
[1:09:15] he said we're having Holy Ghost services
[1:09:17] in our church and dancing in the spirit
[1:09:20] and I just wanted you to know that and
[1:09:22] he put it right on YouTube for everybody
[1:09:24] to read
[1:09:25] and so God is doing it's not about
[1:09:28] dancing
[1:09:29] it's not about running around it's about
[1:09:32] freedom
[1:09:33] how can you say you have freedom in
[1:09:36] Jesus Christ and look like a corpse
[1:09:39] through a three-hour service there's no
[1:09:42] life in that
[1:09:46] and so God's just doing stuff
[1:09:50] and I want to thank him for it and
[1:09:52] praise him for it so let's get the word
[1:09:55] out every chance we can today is
[1:09:58] ariely's uh it's just Ariel for the rest
[1:10:01] of you
[1:10:02] for me it's ariely today is her 14th
[1:10:05] birthday
[1:10:06] she's got a baby I think in her arms so
[1:10:09] we won't ask her to stand up but let's
[1:10:10] say happy birthday to Ariel
[1:10:12] [Applause]
[1:10:18] I was just on the other side of the door
[1:10:21] when she was born and uh in their home
[1:10:24] and God worked a miracle for her
[1:10:28] he really did she had a little
[1:10:30] complication and uh she was was not a
[1:10:34] normal color when she got here she was
[1:10:36] pretty blue and within just a few
[1:10:39] minutes the Lord moved for her and she
[1:10:41] was as beautiful that day as she is
[1:10:44] today
[1:10:45] and God has been good to that family
[1:10:48] and they thought well she was so
[1:10:50] beautiful and so so near perfect that
[1:10:53] they would just that would just probably
[1:10:54] be the Caboose I guess that's it what it
[1:10:57] seems to be but anyway tomorrow is

[1:21:21] I hope that
[1:21:23] that everyone is quite a lot of flooding

[1:21:28] for requests from our wonderful sainted
[1:21:31] friends in Amarillo who
[1:21:34] are
[1:21:35] really dealing with a lot of flooding
[1:21:39] God bless you from Tema my brother
[1:21:42] and brother Samson God bless you as well
[1:21:47] first Thessalonians
[1:21:50] chapter 4.
[1:21:53] verse 15 through 17 it's 12 17 and he
[1:21:59] caught Watchers there
[1:22:01] we're just starting
[1:22:05] for this we say unto you by the word of
[1:22:07] the Lord that we which are alive and
[1:22:11] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[1:22:14] not prevent them which are asleep
[1:22:19] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:22:24] heaven with a shout where the voice of
[1:22:27] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[1:22:31] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[1:22:37] then we which are alive and remain shall
[1:22:41] be caught up together with them in the
[1:22:44] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[1:22:49] so shall we ever be with the Lord this
[1:22:54] is not metaphorical language
[1:22:56] this isn't poetry or prose this is a
[1:23:01] coming promise it is a promise from the
[1:23:04] Lord and it will have physical reality
[1:23:07] in the near future
[1:23:10] in fact it is unfolding even now
[1:23:14] the Rapture process began somewhere
[1:23:18] around the year 1963 so we are 73 83 93
[1:23:25] 2003
[1:23:27] 2013
[1:23:29] 2023 we are approximately 60 years into
[1:23:33] the Rapture process
[1:23:35] and in a moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:23:38] that last Trump is going to sound
[1:23:41] finishing the process
[1:23:45] somebody said you really believe that I
[1:23:47] really believe it you really believe
[1:23:49] we're in the Rapture now I believe I'm
[1:23:50] in the Rapture now I was raptured this
[1:23:53] morning
[1:23:55] that presence of God caught me up this
[1:23:58] morning into him
[1:24:01] it happened to me last weekend
[1:24:03] I've been raptured since the weekend
[1:24:07] I got raptured here Tuesday night
[1:24:09] listening to these amazing testimonies
[1:24:12] of the grace of God
[1:24:13] I went to prayer Friday here and I felt
[1:24:16] the same presence of God just catch me
[1:24:18] right up so we're in the process of the
[1:24:21] change
[1:24:22] we're being changed now
[1:24:24] anybody with me
[1:24:27] may God add his Blessing to the reading
[1:24:28] of his word I almost left you standing
[1:24:30] you may be seated now who's ready to
[1:24:34] study
[1:24:35] I didn't hear you
[1:24:37] we got a little studying to do this
[1:24:39] morning it may not be exciting but it's
[1:24:42] it's necessary to get some things that
[1:24:46] we've been talking about and I'm going
[1:24:49] to use some terminology in a moment that
[1:24:51] some of you will most of you will be
[1:24:53] very familiar with but I want to refresh
[1:24:56] your memory on where we get this term so
[1:25:00] that you'll understand that many things
[1:25:02] are happening spiritually right now
[1:25:07] simultaneously and it you can't read a
[1:25:10] book of the Bible simultaneously
[1:25:14] in other words you could actually be
[1:25:17] reading two chapters and those two
[1:25:20] chapters may actually have their
[1:25:22] fulfillment at the same time
[1:25:25] and they may not even be in the Bible
[1:25:27] chronologically
[1:25:29] now I know there are many people who
[1:25:31] believe the Bible is written
[1:25:32] chronologically but it's not
[1:25:35] so so you may we they they the the
[1:25:38] editors and those who have given us our
[1:25:42] modern form of the Holy Bible
[1:25:44] they have decided for us the order of
[1:25:48] the books of the Bible
[1:25:49] and we get over to the Book of
[1:25:51] Revelation and many people believe that
[1:25:54] the Book of Revelation is truly written
[1:25:56] in chronological order that's incorrect
[1:25:58] because the Book of Revelation is often
[1:26:01] giving us the atmosphere of Heaven and
[1:26:06] the atmosphere of Earth at the same time
[1:26:09] but in another chapter
[1:26:11] in other words there is a lap over or a
[1:26:15] crossing over or there is a simultaneous
[1:26:19] happening going on in one chapter and
[1:26:22] the next chapter so it tells what's
[1:26:24] happening in Earth at the same time that
[1:26:28] these other things are happening in
[1:26:30] heaven did I thoroughly confuse you or
[1:26:32] do you understand what I'm saying if you
[1:26:34] do say Amen
[1:26:36] we understand and so sometimes people
[1:26:39] can get really bogged down when they
[1:26:41] study the Book of Revelation or read the
[1:26:43] book of Revelation because they don't
[1:26:46] understand that sometimes we're hearing
[1:26:48] what's happening around the throne in
[1:26:51] one section of verses and then the next
[1:26:53] verse it starts telling us what's
[1:26:55] happening on the earth and and it
[1:26:58] doesn't mean that this happens in heaven
[1:27:00] and then this happens in Earth it means
[1:27:02] it's happening at the same time so John
[1:27:05] being an eagle prophet he was not only
[1:27:08] able to tell us the things that would be
[1:27:10] off the Earth he was able to tell us
[1:27:12] what would be in the heaven and he saw
[1:27:15] it in his time
[1:27:17] transported to our time via the spirit
[1:27:22] and so he time traveled in the realm of
[1:27:26] the spirit and that's powerful to
[1:27:28] understand because he has an insight to
[1:27:31] what's about to happen because to him he
[1:27:34] already saw it happen
[1:27:35] isn't that good
[1:27:37] and so I want to go to the message the
[1:27:39] Rapture and I've added a couple of
[1:27:42] paragraphs to what we've already read in
[1:27:45] this study we did 154 and 155. I
[1:27:51] mentioned to you that brother Branham is
[1:27:53] quite distracted at times in this sermon
[1:27:56] because they are they're coming to to
[1:28:00] try to clear the dishes it was a dinner
[1:28:02] they're coming to try to clear the
[1:28:04] dishes and uh there are several times
[1:28:07] where he kind of stumbles a bit and
[1:28:10] backs up and goes on and finally I can't
[1:28:13] remember exactly how that happened but
[1:28:15] finally I think brother Branham turned
[1:28:17] to someone off the mic and said I'll pay
[1:28:21] for the extra time if they'll just leave
[1:28:23] us alone
[1:28:24] and he knew that there was more to this
[1:28:27] that needed to be spoken because he was
[1:28:30] about to leave the scene and the next
[1:28:33] thing we were to look for in a as a
[1:28:36] major event was the Rapture and so we
[1:28:39] would need to understand that and so
[1:28:41] I've added paragraph 152 and 153 to our
[1:28:45] study now it's the first thing it's a
[1:28:49] trumpet no no he corrects himself a
[1:28:51] voice a shout and then a voice and then
[1:28:54] a trumpet so Shout a messenger giving
[1:28:58] the people ready
[1:29:00] so if I were a note taker don't get too
[1:29:03] distracted by your notes and Miss what's
[1:29:05] happening here but if I were a note
[1:29:07] taker I would write that down number one
[1:29:10] shout a messenger getting the people
[1:29:13] ready and I would add to that that it's
[1:29:17] a message it's a message the emphasis
[1:29:20] should not be on the messenger the
[1:29:23] emphasis should be on the message
[1:29:26] how many of you agree with that
[1:29:29] now let me see if I can find something
[1:29:31] that that's not planned but it came to
[1:29:33] my mind and I may not be able to find it
[1:29:36] fast enough yes
[1:29:43] uh let me just this you won't have it
[1:29:45] and I don't want you to lose where we
[1:29:47] are but if you happen to pull it it's
[1:29:49] all right but you can write it down you
[1:29:51] studyers it's in the message Investments
[1:29:58] 1963-0803 B and that must have been a
[1:30:00] breakfast I'm assuming
[1:30:02] and uh paragraph 107 says and now if
[1:30:07] your denomination has closed the door to
[1:30:10] such a message and such a messenger not
[1:30:14] me
[1:30:19] I'm your brother
[1:30:22] fellow servant with you
[1:30:26] now let's hear what brother Branham says
[1:30:28] about the messenger
[1:30:29] but the messenger is the Holy Spirit
[1:30:39] expressing himself through human beings
[1:30:44] the church that Christ Sanctified for
[1:30:48] this very purpose now those of you who
[1:30:51] are looking for it there may not have
[1:30:52] found it let me read it to you again
[1:30:54] paragraph 107 and now
[1:30:57] if your denomination has closed the door
[1:31:00] to such a message and such a messenger
[1:31:03] thank you not me
[1:31:09] this is August
[1:31:12] of 63.
[1:31:15] the shout is going out
[1:31:19] and brother Branham does not want the
[1:31:22] emphasis on him
[1:31:24] come on he says not me I'm your brother
[1:31:33] so for those who teach that brother
[1:31:35] Branham is in the book of the Revelation
[1:31:37] teaching John the end time the the the
[1:31:40] the the one who says to him I am of your
[1:31:44] fellow servants the brethren in order
[1:31:47] for that to have happened we would have
[1:31:49] to believe something that we don't even
[1:31:51] believe
[1:31:52] and so that wasn't particularly brother
[1:31:54] Branham they tried to make something out
[1:31:56] of that why don't we just stick with the
[1:31:59] word and try to follow what he said he
[1:32:02] said not me I'm your brother a fellow
[1:32:07] servant with you but the messenger is
[1:32:10] the holy spirit
[1:32:13] expressing himself through human beings
[1:32:17] brother Branham was one of those human
[1:32:19] beings that the Holy Spirit was
[1:32:22] expressing himself through I pray that
[1:32:25] there are those Among Us
[1:32:28] that the Holy Spirit can express himself
[1:32:30] through in the last days because that
[1:32:33] was the call to the corporate bride
[1:32:35] isn't that right
[1:32:36] so not me I'm your brother fellow
[1:32:40] servant with you but the messenger is
[1:32:42] the holy spirit expressing himself
[1:32:44] through human beings the church that
[1:32:46] Christ Sanctified for this very purpose
[1:32:51] now that's powerful the church was
[1:32:55] Sanctified washed and set apart for the
[1:32:59] very purpose that the Holy Spirit could
[1:33:02] come and Minister through them
[1:33:05] so brother Branham was a conduit
[1:33:09] you and I must also be conduits
[1:33:12] pipes pipelines for the Holy Ghost to
[1:33:17] flow through to speak through to
[1:33:20] minister through in such an hour as this
[1:33:23] now we go back to the Rapture message
[1:33:25] we're studying this morning
[1:33:28] we go back to the Rapture message and he
[1:33:32] says shout a messenger getting the
[1:33:34] people ready now let me ask you who is
[1:33:37] the messenger getting people ready
[1:33:40] holy spirit is the messenger and we all
[1:33:43] can see if you can't you're blind
[1:33:46] you need some help I'll help you if
[1:33:49] you're willing there's no sin in asking
[1:33:52] questions
[1:33:54] there's no sin when you don't understand
[1:33:55] something if there's no sin in asking
[1:33:59] you do it in a right Spirit you do it at
[1:34:02] the right time you do it in the right
[1:34:04] forum
[1:34:06] you don't interrupt the preacher to ask
[1:34:08] a question is that right brother random
[1:34:11] taught us from the scripture that the
[1:34:13] spirit of the prophets are subject to
[1:34:15] the prophets you don't interrupt one
[1:34:17] who's being used for that moment you do
[1:34:19] it at the right time and in an order let
[1:34:22] all things be done a decent in in
[1:34:25] decently and in order this is how we we
[1:34:28] certainly understand but I don't want
[1:34:30] anybody to think you are going to be
[1:34:32] criticized
[1:34:33] or ostracized because you don't
[1:34:36] understand something
[1:34:38] we ask and we we do what I mentioned
[1:34:41] earlier uh could not take this off
[1:34:45] we uh
[1:34:50] we need the eyes of our understanding
[1:34:53] opened
[1:34:55] because this message is to simplify
[1:34:57] things
[1:34:58] not complicate things
[1:35:00] [Music]
[1:35:02] now the second is a voice
[1:35:05] of the Resurrection
[1:35:09] and the Bible tells us in first
[1:35:11] Thessalonians 4 it's the voice of the
[1:35:13] archangel
[1:35:15] which is a chief angel
[1:35:17] and that Angel's voice is made up
[1:35:21] of the voices of a many-membered bride
[1:35:25] it's not bride talking
[1:35:28] it's Christ talking through them
[1:35:32] amen that's what makes it Chief that's
[1:35:35] what makes it head that's what causes it
[1:35:39] to stand out above all other voices it's
[1:35:43] a Vindicated voice speaking of
[1:35:46] Vindicated word and it's the same voice
[1:35:50] that that's going to call the little
[1:35:53] bride out of the grave
[1:35:56] good morning
[1:35:57] that little bride is going to call for
[1:36:00] the resurrection of her fellow bride
[1:36:02] members it will be the voice of the
[1:36:05] bridegroom echoed
[1:36:08] Amplified
[1:36:11] like a microphone through the voice of
[1:36:15] the Bride collectively speaking brother
[1:36:18] random said the second is the voice of
[1:36:20] the Resurrection the same voice a loud
[1:36:23] voice in Saint John 11
[1:36:25] 38-44 that called Lazarus from the grave
[1:36:30] now here we find out that the same voice
[1:36:34] of the Archangel that will awake the
[1:36:38] sleeping Saints
[1:36:40] is the same voice that called Lazarus
[1:36:43] from the grave
[1:36:45] now whose voice was that it was the
[1:36:47] voice of Our Lord
[1:36:49] it was the voice of Jesus Christ
[1:36:52] and that voice is also the voice of the
[1:36:56] eternal spirit of the father because
[1:37:00] Jehovah of the Old Testament is the Lord
[1:37:03] Jesus Christ of the New Testament if you
[1:37:07] understand that say man they are not two
[1:37:10] people
[1:37:13] Jesus is not the second person
[1:37:19] I heard brother Bannon preaching the
[1:37:21] other day
[1:37:22] and he made a slip
[1:37:25] he said the Holy Ghost the third person
[1:37:27] not the trinity
[1:37:30] he knew better than that
[1:37:33] is not what the word said
[1:37:35] that's not what God says
[1:37:38] remember that's not what the messenger
[1:37:40] was saying
[1:37:42] that was Humanity that got in the way
[1:37:45] and we do that sometime but nothing was
[1:37:48] lost
[1:37:49] because here we are the bride we're not
[1:37:52] here trying to prove brother Ben I'm
[1:37:53] wrong we don't have to the word corrects
[1:37:56] we're just here to say we had a human
[1:37:58] vessel
[1:38:00] one who could misspeak over over speak
[1:38:02] get things out of order when he's
[1:38:05] telling them
[1:38:06] he just did it here he said here the
[1:38:09] first thing is a trumpet
[1:38:12] in paragraph 152 the beginning the verse
[1:38:14] saying the trumpet or a voice a shout he
[1:38:16] finally got it in fact he says a trumpet
[1:38:19] a voice a shout a voice and then a
[1:38:21] trumpet
[1:38:23] foreign
[1:38:25] now that's because you and I were here
[1:38:27] for a reason we're here to study this
[1:38:30] out
[1:38:31] we're here to take everything back to
[1:38:33] the word and then we can recognize that
[1:38:37] the the shout is the message to gather
[1:38:41] the bride together the voice of the
[1:38:44] Archangel is a voice of Christ it is the
[1:38:48] voice of the Resurrection it is Christ
[1:38:51] speaking his word through a
[1:38:54] mini-membered bride he said it's the
[1:38:57] same voice that called Lazarus from the
[1:39:00] grave now let's go on
[1:39:03] getting the bride together
[1:39:07] and then the resurrection of the Dead
[1:39:10] see to be caught up with it now watch
[1:39:13] the three things take place the next is
[1:39:18] what was a trumpet that's right
[1:39:21] the trumpet follows The Voice
[1:39:24] then he says a voice a shout a voice a
[1:39:29] trumpet
[1:39:33] where what are we doing here we're
[1:39:35] studying this we're taking it back to
[1:39:37] the word what's the order shout voice
[1:39:41] trumpet let me hear you say Shout voice
[1:39:45] trumpet three phases of the Rapture
[1:39:48] shout voice trumpet
[1:39:51] now the the third thing in paragraph 153
[1:39:55] is a trumpet
[1:39:57] which always at the Feast of trumpets is
[1:40:00] calling the people to the feast
[1:40:03] and that'll be the bride's supper
[1:40:09] I love the way he said that he said that
[1:40:12] will be the bride's supper the Lamb's
[1:40:15] supper with the bride
[1:40:18] now where does that take place
[1:40:21] I'd like to speak to some of you perusia
[1:40:23] Brethren out there who say that it will
[1:40:26] take place in the earth or has already
[1:40:28] taken place in the earth you are wrong
[1:40:31] he said clearly here that the Lambs
[1:40:34] suffer with the bride is in this in the
[1:40:37] sky
[1:40:38] which means in the dimensions of the
[1:40:41] heavenlies
[1:40:45] correct which may not be as far away
[1:40:49] from Earth as what we think
[1:40:52] are you with me
[1:40:54] do I have to explain that are you there
[1:40:56] or can we go on
[1:40:58] 154 the first thing comes forth is his
[1:41:04] message
[1:41:05] now that's a capital h
[1:41:07] the editor wanted you to know it's not
[1:41:10] William branham's message
[1:41:12] brother Brandon was referring to him
[1:41:14] Christ
[1:41:15] calling the bride together and this has
[1:41:18] been a process
[1:41:22] you see the shout was going out at least
[1:41:26] we know we're not going to try to put
[1:41:28] definite years on this
[1:41:31] because we believe that the messenger
[1:41:33] Holy Spirit was already at work when
[1:41:37] brother Branham is just beginning his
[1:41:39] ministry so we're not going to say that
[1:41:41] that the the shout is only
[1:41:44] 63-65 but if we had to boil it down we
[1:41:49] would say that through the years
[1:41:52] 1963 to 65 a definitive message was
[1:41:57] being presented
[1:41:59] now much of that message had its
[1:42:01] foundation in earlier sermons
[1:42:04] but in 63 through 65 there was an
[1:42:09] anointing to bring things into a concise
[1:42:13] message
[1:42:16] that we could search through those years
[1:42:20] and find a tremendous Foundation to
[1:42:24] stand on to understand who we are and
[1:42:29] what our ministry will be in the end
[1:42:32] time did you follow that
[1:42:34] I'm not going to say that something
[1:42:37] after 63 was more anointed than before
[1:42:40] it's all part of the messenger the Holy
[1:42:44] Spirit doing his work of ministry
[1:42:47] through a vessel but if you were running
[1:42:51] out of time
[1:42:53] and you didn't have time to search
[1:42:55] through the earlier years
[1:42:57] you can get Rapture Ready by receiving a
[1:43:01] revelation of the ministry that was
[1:43:04] presented during that period of time let
[1:43:09] me think about that and make sure that I
[1:43:10] I haven't misspoken make sure that
[1:43:12] you're not confused is that okay to say
[1:43:15] I think it is let's go on
[1:43:17] so first the call the message calls the
[1:43:21] bride together the next thing it's a
[1:43:23] resurrection of the sleeping bride the
[1:43:25] ones that died back in the other ages
[1:43:29] they're caught together
[1:43:32] that's the voice of the Archangel that's
[1:43:35] catching them together the Trump is what
[1:43:38] causes the dead then to get up at the
[1:43:41] sounding of that last call that's when
[1:43:44] they they not only awakened spiritually
[1:43:46] but even those who are naturally dead
[1:43:49] are awakened and the trumpet the feast
[1:43:53] in the heavens in the sky why that's the
[1:43:56] thing that takes place friend so he's
[1:43:58] talking about the lamb supper
[1:44:02] the bride's supper and then in paragraph
[1:44:05] 155 are you still here we're studying
[1:44:10] we're right there ready now
[1:44:13] the only thing
[1:44:15] the church coming out has got to lay
[1:44:19] before the son to ripen
[1:44:23] I I see some ripening taking place
[1:44:26] Tuesday night I heard about some
[1:44:29] ripening happening in the lives of the
[1:44:31] Bride don't you take some old dead life
[1:44:34] that has no unction no anointing no
[1:44:36] quickening power in it and tell me that
[1:44:39] somebody ripening in the sun they're
[1:44:41] rotting
[1:44:43] they're sitting in churches across this
[1:44:45] world today rotting
[1:44:48] because you cannot ripen under a dead
[1:44:52] letter
[1:44:55] you can't even ripen under the mechanics
[1:44:59] only
[1:45:00] [Applause]
[1:45:02] it takes them the Dynamics
[1:45:06] to come down on the mechanics
[1:45:10] that's what you see God doing in this
[1:45:12] day
[1:45:13] Hallelujah the only thing the church
[1:45:17] coming out has got to lay before the sun
[1:45:19] to ripen the great combine will come by
[1:45:22] after a while the wheat will be burned
[1:45:25] the stalks but the grain will be
[1:45:28] gathered into its Garner see how many of
[1:45:33] you can follow that through
[1:45:35] so the shout Ministry
[1:45:39] uh was predominantly from 1963 to 1965.
[1:45:46] so if you are just beginning to hear the
[1:45:49] messages
[1:45:51] I encourage you
[1:45:53] I don't usually say things like this
[1:45:56] but I encourage you to focus on those
[1:45:59] ears for now
[1:46:02] will give you suggestions and
[1:46:05] assignments from the entire Ministry of
[1:46:09] the messenger
[1:46:11] but I think you would really appreciate
[1:46:14] the quickening power
[1:46:17] that that falls on those years of
[1:46:21] ministry
[1:46:22] the ministry of the voice of the
[1:46:24] Archangel which is Christ speaking
[1:46:28] through his bride that has been going on
[1:46:31] we could say anywhere from 1963 those
[1:46:36] who were receiving the shout Ministry
[1:46:38] then all the way up to the hour that we
[1:46:42] are living in now 63 73 83 93 2003 2013.
[1:46:52] 60 years
[1:46:55] of voice of Archangel Ministry
[1:47:00] it has not culminated yet
[1:47:03] how do I know because the bride has not
[1:47:06] yet received her change
[1:47:08] but we are closer to it than we have
[1:47:11] ever been before
[1:47:14] and the only way to know where we are is
[1:47:17] to look in and see where we are and
[1:47:20] that's what we're trying to do this
[1:47:22] morning and then the trumpet will be the
[1:47:25] final Rapture call when we have received
[1:47:30] a body change and rise to meet the Lord
[1:47:33] in the air so we can say as I stated a
[1:47:37] moment ago the process of the Rapture
[1:47:39] has been going on since 1963.
[1:47:43] We Believe
[1:47:44] that since brother branham's Ministry
[1:47:47] was the shout the message and since the
[1:47:52] trumpet is the final Rapture call which
[1:47:55] is yet to come that we as a bride the
[1:48:00] bride of Christ are currently fulfilling
[1:48:03] the voice phase of the coming of the
[1:48:07] Lord
[1:48:08] so if you want to know where we are we
[1:48:11] are in that period of the voice of the
[1:48:15] Archangel Christ is speaking to and
[1:48:19] through his bride
[1:48:22] we are re-digging the wells that brother
[1:48:26] Branham dug in the 60s
[1:48:31] anybody with me
[1:48:33] we know what happened the enemy comes in
[1:48:36] Abraham dug some wells
[1:48:39] and the enemy comes in and fills up
[1:48:42] those Wells is that right and so Isaac
[1:48:45] came along and it was a part of his
[1:48:48] Destiny and his call to re-dig to unstop
[1:48:52] the wells that Abraham his father had
[1:48:55] dug before him and I'm standing before
[1:48:58] you this morning recognizing that we
[1:49:01] have the same call that was given to
[1:49:03] Isaac
[1:49:05] this little bride has got to re well
[1:49:08] Glory
[1:49:09] we've got to re-dig the whales that were
[1:49:13] dug a generation ago somebody said why
[1:49:16] because we must prophesy again
[1:49:20] [Applause]
[1:49:23] Revelation 10 11. it's our
[1:49:26] responsibility then
[1:49:29] and he said unto me thou must prophesy
[1:49:34] again before many peoples and Nations
[1:49:38] and tongues and kings
[1:49:41] in order to do that we don't start over
[1:49:44] I hope you're with me we're studying
[1:49:47] we don't go off over here and start
[1:49:49] digging new whales
[1:49:52] trying to make something happen
[1:49:55] no we don't do anything by striving
[1:49:58] come on and that's what many people have
[1:50:01] tried to do they try to make their own
[1:50:03] message they try to make themselves or
[1:50:06] someone they care about an eighth
[1:50:08] Messenger to kind of come we're waiting
[1:50:10] on him we're waiting on him and look I
[1:50:13] can do the same thing I can show you
[1:50:15] quotes all through the message where
[1:50:17] brother Branham says I'm only laying a
[1:50:19] foundation for him
[1:50:21] and if you didn't know any better you
[1:50:23] think for him was going to be a human
[1:50:25] being born to a woman
[1:50:26] but if you get a revelation and put all
[1:50:28] the quotes together he told he told us
[1:50:31] who he was coming to forerun he said my
[1:50:34] Ministry is to Forum the coming word the
[1:50:37] coming word is the hymn the real
[1:50:39] messenger the Holy Ghost is the hymn so
[1:50:43] we're not looking for another worldwide
[1:50:45] messenger or leader to come we're
[1:50:47] following the same messenger that
[1:50:49] William Branham followed
[1:50:51] that little bride's got to speak as he
[1:50:54] spoke and we do that not by digging our
[1:50:57] own Wells
[1:50:58] I wish you'd wake up in here
[1:51:01] we do it by re-digging whales that have
[1:51:03] already been dubbed that the enemy came
[1:51:05] in that's what I'm trying to do this
[1:51:07] morning I may not be doing too good at
[1:51:09] it but that's what I'm trying to do this
[1:51:11] morning is to unstop some wells
[1:51:15] you hang around a minute or two and
[1:51:16] you'll know where I'm going in a moment
[1:51:18] we're trying to unstop some things and I
[1:51:22] don't mean no harm I don't want to get
[1:51:24] into this I spent the early part of my
[1:51:26] Ministry having to fight against these
[1:51:29] things that people said that were
[1:51:31] contrary to the word and the message I
[1:51:33] don't want to end my Ministry with
[1:51:35] having to do the same thing
[1:51:36] predominantly but I find myself
[1:51:40] realizing that somebody
[1:51:44] anybody everybody has got to do their
[1:51:48] part
[1:51:50] so I want to say that a lot of these
[1:51:52] Wells that brother Branham dug and PR
[1:51:55] and that provided Living Water to so
[1:51:57] many people it was preachers who who
[1:52:00] stopped them up
[1:52:03] [Music]
[1:52:04] come on I hate to say it
[1:52:07] but you know it's the truth
[1:52:09] and if you don't want to be identified
[1:52:11] with what I just said just don't say a
[1:52:12] man loud amen so that they can catch
[1:52:15] your voice
[1:52:16] I don't want him to catch your voice on
[1:52:18] the stream if you don't want to be
[1:52:19] identified with that
[1:52:22] here we are told that the that the
[1:52:24] laodicea and church age was about the
[1:52:26] restoration of the gifts
[1:52:27] so we come on down here in the laodicea
[1:52:30] and church age is still going on and
[1:52:31] what do they come and tell us the gifts
[1:52:33] are done away with
[1:52:37] we know it's not true because God
[1:52:40] doesn't restore and then take it back
[1:52:42] he is restoring the bride tree he's
[1:52:47] putting the fruit back on the tree
[1:52:50] he's restoring it he's rebuilding it
[1:52:53] he's not stripping it down
[1:52:56] in fact I think we should have in this
[1:52:59] hour do we may probably not but I think
[1:53:02] we should have in this hour the highest
[1:53:05] order of spiritual gifts that the church
[1:53:08] has ever known because we now have the
[1:53:11] word
[1:53:13] to discern those gifts to check those
[1:53:15] gifts to judge those gifts
[1:53:19] to put those gifts in their proper place
[1:53:24] we don't have triple married people
[1:53:26] running around living all kinds of lives
[1:53:29] doing all kinds of things and then
[1:53:31] wanting to lead the bride of Christ with
[1:53:33] gifts
[1:53:36] we don't have such as that what brother
[1:53:39] Branham had to say about the gifts a lot
[1:53:41] of the time and I think Hawk mentions it
[1:53:43] in the podcast where did I did I make
[1:53:46] that up Park yes no you said it
[1:53:49] you said something about you had come
[1:53:51] across some of the negative in the
[1:53:54] message concerning gifts because there
[1:53:57] is some corrective words that are spoken
[1:53:59] there that some people have gone to seed
[1:54:02] on
[1:54:04] they took that comment out of context of
[1:54:06] scripture and they've gone way too far
[1:54:10] and that's very convenient when you have
[1:54:12] sin in the church and you want to try to
[1:54:13] keep it hidden
[1:54:17] did I just say that what are you doing
[1:54:19] this morning I'm re-digging some wells
[1:54:22] oh
[1:54:23] God is not a I don't want to say this
[1:54:26] thing I'm sorry I often say Indian giver
[1:54:28] I I am partial Native American uh my my
[1:54:33] great-grandmother uh great great
[1:54:36] grandmother was full-blooded Cherokee
[1:54:38] Indian and and I don't believe that that
[1:54:41] that uh the First Nations people are the
[1:54:44] or the Indian people as we call them I
[1:54:47] don't believe that they were all the
[1:54:48] time trying to trick and and cheat uh I
[1:54:52] think that was the white man doing that
[1:54:54] [Applause]
[1:54:56] but but there is a term that we're kind
[1:54:58] of familiar with an Indian giver
[1:54:59] somebody who gives you something and
[1:55:02] then comes to take it back well I'd say
[1:55:03] that would be the white man that did
[1:55:05] that
[1:55:07] we they gave them a partial of land and
[1:55:10] then come in and put so many
[1:55:11] restrictions and stipulations and uh
[1:55:14] until they were really just in essence
[1:55:16] taking a little pizza bits and pizzas
[1:55:18] back until they were pressed into a tiny
[1:55:20] little spot
[1:55:21] and we're suffering I want you to know
[1:55:23] the First Nations and Native American
[1:55:25] people are suffering today still today
[1:55:29] because of some of this mistreatment
[1:55:32] the drugs the human trafficking is is
[1:55:37] higher in those communities than any
[1:55:40] Community we know of in North America
[1:55:43] because it has created this dependency
[1:55:48] uh we could say a lot here huh
[1:55:51] but I'm going to move on now but you're
[1:55:54] familiar with that term I don't believe
[1:55:57] God cheats like that I don't believe God
[1:56:00] restores the gifts and then takes him
[1:56:02] away I believe God restores them and
[1:56:05] then he perfects them
[1:56:07] so I think that tongues and
[1:56:09] interpretation should be more perfect
[1:56:11] Among Us it should be I didn't say it
[1:56:14] necessarily is it should be more perfect
[1:56:17] Among Us than any group of people in the
[1:56:19] world because we have the word to judge
[1:56:22] and to discern what a gift is supposed
[1:56:24] to be
[1:56:26] and so it's not that God has taken them
[1:56:28] now we understand uh that we've sort of
[1:56:31] moved up into the intellect we've moved
[1:56:33] up into the brain and we are under a
[1:56:36] flying eagle anointing we understand
[1:56:38] that but remember that's just a higher
[1:56:41] order of God speaking
[1:56:45] brother random believed that the
[1:56:47] preachers were anointed to speak the
[1:56:49] word he believed it he said you he's
[1:56:52] talked about getting as close to the
[1:56:53] pulpit as you can get
[1:56:55] because that's where the angel stands he
[1:56:58] said it and that's where God comes down
[1:57:00] to speak to his people that doesn't mean
[1:57:02] everybody who stands every man who
[1:57:04] stands here uh is is God to the people
[1:57:09] we're not making God out of men
[1:57:11] especially this one
[1:57:12] because I'm like sister shoshana I know
[1:57:15] me
[1:57:17] didn't you appreciate that I know me
[1:57:20] I I get so tired sometimes of this
[1:57:24] superficial way of living
[1:57:26] where we don't even know ourselves
[1:57:29] and we portray I'll tell you social
[1:57:31] media has created that environment
[1:57:35] where a woman can have a filthy house
[1:57:38] but she doesn't post a picture of that
[1:57:45] she just builds her a little clean
[1:57:47] corner somewhere and takes a picture of
[1:57:48] that
[1:57:51] leading you to believe that the whole
[1:57:53] house looks like a man scene and I don't
[1:57:56] think it should
[1:58:00] and if and if your house looks like a
[1:58:02] magazine all the time I don't think
[1:58:04] you're really living
[1:58:09] I don't think you're letting your
[1:58:11] children be children
[1:58:16] let me preach on that a minute
[1:58:18] my mother thought everything had to be
[1:58:21] just right just so so
[1:58:23] I was the cleanest child in the county
[1:58:26] I saw Ezekiel the other day uh he's the
[1:58:30] one I saw a picture of stripped off in
[1:58:32] his diaper mud from the top of his head
[1:58:35] all the way to his feet in fact I heard
[1:58:38] he stripped off his diaper
[1:58:44] oh
[1:58:47] if that panics you you're not really
[1:58:49] living either
[1:58:56] we create huge taboos
[1:59:00] calling more attention to things that we
[1:59:03] ought to just let be normal life
[1:59:06] creating curiosity that ought not to be
[1:59:08] created
[1:59:11] oh I got so many subjects going on here
[1:59:13] I'll never finish
[1:59:16] I'll never finish
[1:59:17] I think we ought to live
[1:59:20] I don't want I don't want nasty
[1:59:24] nobody wants that but I think that that
[1:59:27] sometimes living has to take priority
[1:59:31] over everything being in its place all
[1:59:33] the time
[1:59:35] appearance
[1:59:38] my mother could not parent that way that
[1:59:40] way my mother would have
[1:59:42] would have and I don't want to make you
[1:59:44] have any bad thoughts toward my mother
[1:59:46] but it would have been closer to a
[1:59:47] beating than a whipping if she would
[1:59:50] have found me looking like uh Ezekiel
[1:59:52] was looking here the other night I was
[1:59:54] not allowed to get dirty
[1:59:57] now what kind of life is that
[2:00:04] so there are times when I'm off for the
[2:00:06] day I have to make myself take a shower
[2:00:11] my mother's fault
[2:00:14] squeak it clean all the time on
[2:00:16] come on
[2:00:19] my mother would buy me play clothes
[2:00:24] not at the second hand store
[2:00:27] she'd buy me play clothes and then tell
[2:00:29] me not to ruin them
[2:00:34] now you know why I got so many Hang-Ups
[2:00:36] and problems
[2:00:41] let your family live let your children
[2:00:44] live it's not about a social media
[2:00:48] moment
[2:00:50] I love posting I love watching I love
[2:00:53] seeing what people post but I like it
[2:00:56] when it's real
[2:00:59] I like it when Anna Christine some
[2:01:02] months ago she posted a messy room
[2:01:04] blankets and books and soar and then in
[2:01:07] the next slide it's all cleaned up
[2:01:08] that's reality
[2:01:10] a few minutes ago it looked like a
[2:01:12] cyclone had come through named Mrs Glenn
[2:01:20] but now reality she didn't she wasn't
[2:01:23] Bewitched she didn't twinkle her nose
[2:01:26] and it all cleaned up she had to get in
[2:01:29] there and clean it up and then post a
[2:01:32] picture which give every mother in the
[2:01:34] world hope
[2:01:37] so be real how did I get on that
[2:01:40] you're real
[2:01:42] we're building families
[2:01:45] to be real
[2:01:47] not so secretive all the time
[2:01:50] Not So Undercover all the time if you're
[2:01:54] doing something that you're ashamed for
[2:01:55] somebody else to know don't tell
[2:01:58] [Applause]
[2:02:01] if you're wearing something that you
[2:02:03] don't want anybody else to know you wore
[2:02:05] it don't wear it
[2:02:08] [Applause]
[2:02:12] oh
[2:02:13] my goodness the preacher's here
[2:02:21] thank you thank you thank you amen okay
[2:02:23] I can keep going
[2:02:26] now where were we
[2:02:28] anybody got any thoughts where we were
[2:02:34] yeah God didn't give him he's perfecting
[2:02:37] them he didn't give them to take them
[2:02:38] back thank you Josh he gave them to
[2:02:40] perfect them
[2:02:43] nothing brings Perfection to something
[2:02:46] like the word
[2:02:48] so we are now as the bride of Christ
[2:02:51] currently fulfilling the voice phase of
[2:02:55] the coming of the Lord
[2:02:57] and each one of these phases
[2:03:01] each one of these phases that falls
[2:03:03] underneath the voice
[2:03:06] I'll have to show you that in a minute
[2:03:07] again remind you of what I mean in a
[2:03:10] minute because underneath that voice
[2:03:13] John was told to eat that book
[2:03:19] eat up that book sweet in the mouth
[2:03:22] bitter in the belly
[2:03:24] and then he was told to prophesy again
[2:03:28] each one of these phases
[2:03:32] [Applause]
[2:03:36] third pool
[2:03:39] I want to make sure this morning that
[2:03:43] when we refer to the third pool
[2:03:47] that the people will be able to
[2:03:51] understand what we are referring to
[2:03:54] there is a direct connection between
[2:03:58] Revelation 10 8 through 11. and the
[2:04:03] third pull
[2:04:05] I want to make sure that you are able to
[2:04:07] see that
[2:04:09] Revelation 10
[2:04:11] 1-7 is part of the shout
[2:04:16] it's part of the ministry of the
[2:04:19] messenger of the Holy Ghost
[2:04:21] and how he spoke through brother Branham
[2:04:24] as a chosen vessel to gather a message
[2:04:29] together to present a message that would
[2:04:33] gather a bride together
[2:04:35] but in eight through eleven now let's
[2:04:38] read that
[2:04:39] let's read it again
[2:04:41] and the voice which I heard from Heaven
[2:04:44] spake unto me again and said go and take
[2:04:47] the little book which is open in the
[2:04:50] hand of the Angel which standeth upon
[2:04:52] the sea and upon the Earth that was
[2:04:55] Christ and I went under the angel and
[2:04:58] said unto him give me the little book
[2:04:59] and he said unto me take it and eat it
[2:05:02] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[2:05:04] but it shall be sweet
[2:05:06] uh in thy mouth sweet as honey
[2:05:10] in thy mouth and I took the little book
[2:05:13] out of the Angel's hand
[2:05:15] and ate it up
[2:05:17] and it was in my mouth sweet as honey
[2:05:20] and as soon as I had eaten it my belly
[2:05:23] was bitter
[2:05:24] and he said unto me
[2:05:27] read it for me please
[2:05:32] [Music]
[2:05:35] you see I don't believe that was Mr John
[2:05:38] I believe that's us
[2:05:41] this uh this monitor needs to come down
[2:05:43] just a tad because when I move back it's
[2:05:45] it squeaks just a bit
[2:05:47] not much but just a little bit
[2:05:51] so we understand that the ministry of
[2:05:55] the shout is sort of covered in
[2:05:57] Revelation 10 1-7
[2:05:59] and then the voice of the Archangel
[2:06:02] which is the voice of Christ the word of
[2:06:05] God in the mouth of the Bride that is
[2:06:09] covered in the last verses Revelation 10
[2:06:12] 8 through 11.
[2:06:14] I want you to know that I believe that
[2:06:18] the third pool
[2:06:20] is more applicable
[2:06:24] to Revelation 10 8 through 11.
[2:06:28] then Revelation 10 1-7
[2:06:33] now in order for you to catch that
[2:06:36] come to the conclusion that I've come to
[2:06:38] I want to make sure that we understand
[2:06:41] what the term means third pool are you
[2:06:44] willing to let me do that
[2:06:47] now this is going to take some reading
[2:06:48] and my part some listening on your part
[2:06:52] in the message why are people so tossed
[2:06:56] about
[2:06:57] beginning in paragraph 34.
[2:07:00] but I went home tired weary upset crying
[2:07:06] went to bed that night and after the
[2:07:10] wife got to sleep I went into the room
[2:07:13] and knelt down and said dear Jesus I
[2:07:17] don't know what I'm going to do
[2:07:20] here I am right back where I started
[2:07:24] from
[2:07:28] again
[2:07:30] see I guess I made a failure are you
[2:07:36] with me
[2:07:38] two hours from then he appeared to me
[2:07:43] now I want you to catch the context
[2:07:46] of the vision
[2:07:49] he feels like a failure again
[2:07:56] has anybody in here ever felt like a
[2:07:58] failure again
[2:08:01] here is a man that God is using in the
[2:08:05] healing Revival the voice of healing
[2:08:08] Revival is is sweeping the world
[2:08:14] this is a powerful time 1956.
[2:08:19] the dead are being raised blind eyes are
[2:08:23] open and it wasn't just in the ministry
[2:08:26] of brother Branham it was happening
[2:08:28] world over
[2:08:30] and here he comes feeling like a failure
[2:08:35] again
[2:08:38] two hours from then he appeared to me
[2:08:42] and he showed me a vision of such a
[2:08:45] panoramic view of people I never seen
[2:08:48] I was talking to my wife in the vision
[2:08:54] now you people that know me know I'm not
[2:08:56] a fanatic
[2:08:57] I don't say these things unless they're
[2:08:59] the truth that's right and I've seen it
[2:09:03] now I would rather brandem say something
[2:09:05] like that because he caught the doubt
[2:09:08] [Music]
[2:09:11] he caught the question
[2:09:14] the critical doubt that started creeping
[2:09:18] into somebody's mind maybe their toast
[2:09:21] was burnt that morning maybe they got up
[2:09:24] on the wrong side of the bed maybe they
[2:09:27] were normally it was easier for them to
[2:09:29] believe than to doubt but this
[2:09:31] particular morning he begins to speak on
[2:09:34] this and something comes flooding in the
[2:09:36] atmosphere of the room
[2:09:41] they caught it
[2:09:43] he said I'm not a fanatic you know that
[2:09:45] I don't say these things unless they're
[2:09:47] the truth that's right I've seen it
[2:09:51] I seen brother arganbright standing
[2:09:53] there
[2:09:55] I went up to him he said brother Billy
[2:09:57] we we've give out the prayer all the
[2:10:00] prayer cards and everything is ready now
[2:10:03] for the meeting this is a vision
[2:10:07] we got a way to take you in and out
[2:10:11] I said thank you brother Argan bride why
[2:10:14] would brother arginbrite say that to him
[2:10:16] because he said it was a panoramic crowd
[2:10:18] like he had never seen before
[2:10:21] he said I walked over to see some more
[2:10:23] Brethren and there was another brother
[2:10:25] preaching
[2:10:27] I said who is he
[2:10:29] they said they put him up
[2:10:33] and I said who is they
[2:10:36] and they just turned around and walked
[2:10:39] away
[2:10:40] and the man May dismiss the audience and
[2:10:44] let them all go
[2:10:46] and I said oh he shouldn't do that
[2:10:49] because there is no altar call now those
[2:10:52] of you who have studied this ministry
[2:10:54] for years as I have you will know that
[2:10:56] there was a partial fulfillment of that
[2:10:58] that took place I believe in Mexico
[2:11:01] I could be wrong about the location
[2:11:04] but the Ministerial Association got
[2:11:07] involved in one of the meetings there
[2:11:09] and they tried to send the people home
[2:11:11] cancel the meeting
[2:11:13] but this is a vision he's talking about
[2:11:16] and I uh there is no altar call let's go
[2:11:19] on
[2:11:21] oh he said that other fellow spoke up
[2:11:24] and said we've done took up the offering
[2:11:27] I said when is the offering more
[2:11:31] important than Souls before Christ see
[2:11:35] did you miss what I just said
[2:11:40] they were interested in the offering
[2:11:43] brother Branham was concerned about
[2:11:45] souls
[2:11:47] and at that the angel of the Lord taken
[2:11:50] me out then
[2:11:52] and taken me to a real bright stream of
[2:11:55] water
[2:11:57] it was the most beautiful blue water and
[2:12:00] great fish we're swimming around in it
[2:12:03] he said I will make you a Fisher
[2:12:09] and he said Now cast your lure into the
[2:12:13] water when you do pull it slow first
[2:12:16] time
[2:12:18] next time just give a little jerk
[2:12:23] not too hard
[2:12:25] how many of you know what that's for
[2:12:27] to set the hook
[2:12:30] and the next time set your hook for the
[2:12:34] catch
[2:12:35] and I started throwing my line in the
[2:12:38] water now the first time he given a
[2:12:39] little jerk is to make the fish Chase it
[2:12:42] the second time is to set the hook the
[2:12:45] next time is to set the hook and I
[2:12:47] started I throwed my line in the water I
[2:12:49] pulled it everybody began rejoicing say
[2:12:52] that's wonderful that's wonderful see
[2:12:54] he's gone from a meeting being dismissed
[2:12:58] to a beautiful fishing place where there
[2:13:01] must be Brethren standing around
[2:13:04] he's cast his lure the angel or someone
[2:13:08] there is teaching him how to do it
[2:13:11] he said I I thrown my line in the water
[2:13:14] I pulled it everybody began rejoicing
[2:13:17] that's wonderful that's wonderful I got
[2:13:19] all excited
[2:13:20] wouldn't anybody
[2:13:23] if an angel was teaching you to fish
[2:13:27] wouldn't you get excited
[2:13:31] he said I got all excited and jerked it
[2:13:33] hard on the next one was out
[2:13:37] I pulled the fish and all out of the
[2:13:42] water
[2:13:44] having experience that
[2:13:47] I see how that happens I've done it
[2:13:50] you snatch real hard you pull if it's a
[2:13:53] little fish you pull it right out of the
[2:13:55] water no have no need to reel it in
[2:13:56] you've just snatched it like that and
[2:13:58] here he comes the flying because he's
[2:14:00] not very big especially if you're using
[2:14:02] the cane pole but this was a lure
[2:14:06] he said it was a little bitty fish
[2:14:08] listen just about the size of the lure
[2:14:14] and guess what happened he said I got my
[2:14:17] line are you still with me
[2:14:19] good I got my line all tangled up
[2:14:22] and I was straightening out my line
[2:14:24] anybody ever done that
[2:14:26] that's why fly fishing ain't for me
[2:14:29] I need a reel
[2:14:32] it was just a bird's nest
[2:14:35] of line
[2:14:36] and the man which was talking behind me
[2:14:40] walked around in front of me dressed in
[2:14:44] Palestinian clothes
[2:14:47] and a turban on his head
[2:14:50] he had a white robe
[2:14:52] he said brother Branham
[2:14:56] that's it
[2:14:58] I said I know I didn't do it right I I
[2:15:02] said I jerked it when I ought into he
[2:15:05] said don't get your line tangled up in
[2:15:11] these kinds of times
[2:15:17] what a message
[2:15:19] and I said well I'm running it as
[2:15:21] straight as I can I'll be careful
[2:15:25] and he said now the first time I spoke
[2:15:28] with you
[2:15:29] you put your hands on the people
[2:15:32] and told them what was wrong with them
[2:15:36] and the second poll when you did you
[2:15:40] would know the secrets of their hearts
[2:15:43] and I made you a seer before the people
[2:15:46] leave it there Austin
[2:15:49] I made you a seer before the people now
[2:15:52] let me refresh your memory
[2:15:54] when God first started using Brother
[2:15:57] Branham
[2:15:58] he would often take people by the hand
[2:16:01] the word of the Lord came to him and
[2:16:04] said as Moses was given two sons
[2:16:07] the same kind of ministry began to
[2:16:10] function in brother branham's life you
[2:16:12] can find the eyewitness of brother Ern
[2:16:14] Baxter online where he tells as brother
[2:16:19] branham's Ministry manager at the time
[2:16:21] what it was like to watch brother
[2:16:24] branham's hand change as he came in
[2:16:28] contact with the hand of the patient
[2:16:31] that may sound strange to you but it
[2:16:33] happened to Moses
[2:16:36] remember his hand turned white like
[2:16:38] leprosy
[2:16:40] and and I heard earn Baxter say that as
[2:16:44] I was with brother Branham I began to
[2:16:47] learn what that what was happening I
[2:16:50] could tell the disease
[2:16:52] because I learned by watching his hand
[2:16:54] and hearing him call the disease then I
[2:16:57] began to watch his hand and I could tell
[2:16:59] what the disease was it was that clear
[2:17:02] sometimes it would turn white sometimes
[2:17:05] it would be little bumps sometimes
[2:17:07] streaks of red
[2:17:09] would come across the hand and by that
[2:17:11] brother Brandon began to learn what that
[2:17:14] represented and tell the person their
[2:17:16] disease that's profound
[2:17:19] but what's even more prevalent they were
[2:17:21] healed
[2:17:25] you can make it up
[2:17:28] you can get some people to agree to
[2:17:30] anything
[2:17:31] but you can't you can't impersonate a
[2:17:33] healing like that
[2:17:34] that was God that came down and did the
[2:17:36] healing and then that was the first pool
[2:17:39] that was operating in the first pull of
[2:17:41] the ministry
[2:17:42] the disease telling people the disease
[2:17:44] from reading a sign on the hand then he
[2:17:48] said in a paragraph before this one then
[2:17:50] the second poll came and that is when he
[2:17:52] began to discern the thoughts of the
[2:17:54] people
[2:17:55] and that's when the gift shifted no
[2:17:58] longer by a sign in the hand only that
[2:18:01] still function for a short time as the
[2:18:03] gifts were crossing over and making a
[2:18:06] shift
[2:18:07] and I may be one of the few people
[2:18:09] interested in this but boy does this
[2:18:11] really interesting I didn't ask for that
[2:18:14] I'm not asking for your amen I'm just
[2:18:16] telling you this is quite fascinating to
[2:18:19] me
[2:18:20] and then he would be able to look at
[2:18:23] them sometimes take their hand and he
[2:18:27] began to be able to tell them the
[2:18:29] secrets of the heart
[2:18:32] and you've seen it
[2:18:36] you've seen the video
[2:18:39] and you saw him telling people now one
[2:18:42] lady you've got a letter in your purse
[2:18:45] right now from your daughter telling her
[2:18:46] that I was going to be here
[2:18:50] and you've come and then he prays for
[2:18:52] Miss Eva calls out her name front Brown
[2:18:55] was it brown Eva York
[2:18:59] calls out her first name and last name
[2:19:01] this happened oh my goodness my
[2:19:04] grandmother saw it happening in in
[2:19:06] Birmingham
[2:19:08] she said brother Branham turned his back
[2:19:12] to the audience and went down a whole
[2:19:14] row near her telling every person with
[2:19:17] his back turn their name some of them
[2:19:19] their address some of them their
[2:19:21] doctor's name how God knows
[2:19:24] God knows that and what their disease
[2:19:27] was I've heard brother Brandon the
[2:19:29] prayer lines and you have two if you've
[2:19:30] listened to even a handful of tapes and
[2:19:33] stayed listened to the end and heard any
[2:19:35] of the prayer lines you've heard him say
[2:19:37] things like and and you I see you
[2:19:40] sitting on the side of the bed your
[2:19:41] doctor has pulled up a little stool
[2:19:45] he's telling you the results of your
[2:19:47] X-ray he's telling you you only have so
[2:19:50] many
[2:19:51] days or weeks to live
[2:19:54] he said wait a minute I see you standing
[2:19:57] before me as a young healthy girl
[2:20:00] your mother is putting her arm around
[2:20:03] you and telling you you'll live to
[2:20:05] arrive old age you're healed thus saith
[2:20:09] the Lord
[2:20:13] it's real It's The Sign of the Messiah
[2:20:17] it's what Jesus did at the well
[2:20:20] oh I have no I have no husband I'm not
[2:20:25] mad I don't know oh you've well said you
[2:20:28] have no husband
[2:20:30] you've had five
[2:20:31] and the one you have now the woman you I
[2:20:34] mean the man you have now he doesn't
[2:20:35] belong to you he belongs to somebody
[2:20:37] else and yet there was no condemnation
[2:20:42] he's not judging her and trying to put
[2:20:43] her out of the church he's trying to
[2:20:45] pull her in
[2:20:46] never a man speak like this man
[2:20:50] she knew the Messiah I perceive you're
[2:20:52] him
[2:20:54] our fathers tell us how this thing's
[2:20:56] going to go down something's telling me
[2:20:58] you're the one
[2:21:00] amen and brother Branham was not the
[2:21:04] Messiah
[2:21:05] God allowed that Messianic gift to
[2:21:08] operate in our generation to show us
[2:21:12] where we are in God's economy and how it
[2:21:15] all unfolds then he said that this is
[2:21:18] the the man standing there a middle
[2:21:21] eastern garb
[2:21:23] he calls it Palestinian clothes it was
[2:21:27] Middle Eastern Garb with a turban on his
[2:21:29] head
[2:21:31] which reminds me of
[2:21:34] Joshua the high priest and the scripture
[2:21:37] there doesn't it with a clean turban on
[2:21:39] his head Zechariah 3.
[2:21:42] but anyway and I made you a seer before
[2:21:44] the people I gotta hurry
[2:21:49] and he said now the first time next next
[2:21:52] paragraph
[2:21:55] but you was always this is the
[2:22:02] like a man talking to brother random and
[2:22:05] what does he do
[2:22:07] he rebukes him
[2:22:13] you like saying that don't you I sure do
[2:22:19] why do you like so much and get so much
[2:22:21] out of saying that the angel of the Lord
[2:22:23] rebuked Brother Branham because been
[2:22:25] there
[2:22:26] [Music]
[2:22:27] done that
[2:22:29] didn't get no silly t-shirt
[2:22:33] but learned a lot
[2:22:35] when the Lord puts a weapon on you when
[2:22:37] the Lord corrects you you want to go
[2:22:40] under the dirt
[2:22:41] you don't want to just get out on the
[2:22:43] dirt you want to stick your head under
[2:22:44] the floor because you're ashamed that
[2:22:47] you let anything get out of sort in your
[2:22:49] life
[2:22:50] he said and look at what he said brother
[2:22:52] Banner made this mistake of he said you
[2:22:54] was always trying to explain it
[2:22:59] do you understand what it would be like
[2:23:01] to be called a warlock and operating in
[2:23:04] Witchcraft and a demon and ESP and
[2:23:08] reading minds and fortune tellers
[2:23:12] these are the things the church was
[2:23:14] saying about brother Branham
[2:23:16] while secretly sending their people down
[2:23:18] to the meetings to get healed the
[2:23:20] pastors would stand in the pulpit and
[2:23:22] say he was operating as a soothsayer
[2:23:24] somebody in the church dying they would
[2:23:27] slip around and say go down to the brand
[2:23:28] of media don't tell anybody I told you
[2:23:31] to get a healing
[2:23:33] so brother random faced such criticism
[2:23:37] until he was always trying to just
[2:23:38] explain it a little more to the so that
[2:23:41] they wouldn't uh think it and he was the
[2:23:43] one who would take them to the woman at
[2:23:44] the well and he would try to show that
[2:23:46] gifts can operate this way and and it's
[2:23:48] him and you look to him and you know I'm
[2:23:50] just your brother I'm just your brother
[2:23:52] you ever heard him say I'm just your
[2:23:53] brother
[2:23:54] so all these people that talk about
[2:23:56] brother man I'm trying to bring the
[2:23:58] attention of the people to himself well
[2:24:00] he said well I can't I'm waiting on
[2:24:01] something you know I'm waiting on
[2:24:03] something I'm waiting on him
[2:24:06] and then all of a sudden he's here
[2:24:08] and he said I just saw that light when
[2:24:10] it comes sweeping down or across these
[2:24:12] Stadium lights I think he was making he
[2:24:14] said I saw those lights come sweeping
[2:24:16] her down I saw him when they come
[2:24:17] between me and the light there and come
[2:24:19] sweeping down he's here
[2:24:22] and what would he say next
[2:24:25] he's here I take every spirit
[2:24:30] in this room under my authority in the
[2:24:32] name of the Lord Jesus Christ powerful
[2:24:36] powerful could brother Branham do that
[2:24:38] as an individual no he could do it
[2:24:39] because of the commission that was on
[2:24:41] his life and because the angel of the
[2:24:42] Lord they came if we could get the angel
[2:24:44] of the Lord in this room today we could
[2:24:46] have the same Authority
[2:24:52] remember he's not just one anymore
[2:24:55] he divided himself on the day of
[2:24:57] Pentecost
[2:25:01] he comes in as fire
[2:25:04] praise God you're learning something I
[2:25:06] hope
[2:25:07] he said but you're always trying to
[2:25:09] explain it you ought to have done that
[2:25:10] said you made a public show out of it
[2:25:14] I said I'm very sorry are you listening
[2:25:17] that he'd taken me from there
[2:25:19] my goodness
[2:25:23] that's all there was
[2:25:26] and then he taken me from there and I
[2:25:28] seen a great huge tent and this is what
[2:25:31] we refer to as the tent
[2:25:34] the tent vision
[2:25:37] it's really a part of two other visions
[2:25:40] there are three phases
[2:25:48] take the book and eat it up
[2:25:52] sweet in your mouth billion bitter in
[2:25:55] your belly
[2:25:56] prophesy again
[2:25:59] all three phases of the third pool
[2:26:05] he taken me from there and I seen a
[2:26:08] great huge tent
[2:26:09] and I I never seen such a tent and it
[2:26:12] was packed in line to everywhere with
[2:26:14] people
[2:26:15] and I walked looked like I was standing
[2:26:17] above the people looking down notice
[2:26:20] notice notice notice
[2:26:23] brother Branham was standing above the
[2:26:25] tent
[2:26:27] he wasn't in the tent
[2:26:30] he was looking down on the tent
[2:26:33] we don't have to have brother Branham to
[2:26:35] have the tent
[2:26:39] yes thank you Lord
[2:26:42] looking down where I just made an altar
[2:26:45] call in hundreds and hundreds of people
[2:26:47] were weeping and rejoicing after they
[2:26:49] had accepted the Lord Jesus as their
[2:26:51] savior well he sent me say right now
[2:26:53] that is not one of our ordinary message
[2:26:55] conventions
[2:26:59] it's not even an ordinary camp meeting
[2:27:01] here
[2:27:02] where hundreds and hundreds of people
[2:27:04] are Weeping and rejoicing after they had
[2:27:06] accepted the Lord so something happens
[2:27:09] somebody's got something going on for
[2:27:11] together this many people into a place
[2:27:13] of intimacy
[2:27:15] very good
[2:27:18] and hundreds of people we've been
[2:27:19] rejoicing after they accepted the Lord
[2:27:21] Jesus as their Savior and I looked
[2:27:24] and then I heard a man get up and say
[2:27:26] call the prayer line
[2:27:28] and people began to line up over on this
[2:27:31] side the left from where I was looking
[2:27:33] down towards the platform and they lined
[2:27:35] all the way up and down the street for a
[2:27:37] prayer line
[2:27:39] and I noticed to my left which would
[2:27:41] have been to my right if I was on the
[2:27:43] platform if I was on the platform
[2:27:47] a little wooden building
[2:27:50] and I seen that light that they have the
[2:27:52] picture of you know it's always in the
[2:27:55] meeting
[2:27:56] I seen that light leave me interesting
[2:28:01] leave me he said and go to that little
[2:28:05] building now brother Branham calls it a
[2:28:06] canvas tent he calls it a piece of
[2:28:09] stretch canvas he calls it a little
[2:28:11] wooden building
[2:28:14] I don't know exactly what it looked like
[2:28:18] but it reminds me of what the bride in
[2:28:21] the groom stand under when they are
[2:28:23] married in a in a middle eastern wedding
[2:28:26] or a Jewish wedding
[2:28:28] that little tent that little piece of
[2:28:31] talit stretched across the top
[2:28:34] and we know that in in Bible days they
[2:28:38] would pronounce their vows would be
[2:28:40] pronounced standing under that little
[2:28:42] Hoopa
[2:28:44] and then there then the side curtains
[2:28:47] would be put up and and I don't mean to
[2:28:50] be so plain
[2:28:52] but in the same place where the nuptial
[2:28:56] vowels were taken
[2:28:58] the marriage would be consummated
[2:29:01] not for one day only but for seven days
[2:29:08] while the guests celebrated
[2:29:13] now it's quite an interesting parallel
[2:29:17] because brother Branham is preaching
[2:29:18] about these things one day and he said
[2:29:21] what was that word we found I found the
[2:29:23] other day I can't quite remember what
[2:29:25] that name was what that word was
[2:29:28] he's referring to Supernatural things
[2:29:31] and he's referring to the third pool and
[2:29:34] he's looking for the word he never does
[2:29:36] tell us what the word is
[2:29:39] so for me it's the parallel of that
[2:29:42] little that little stretch and and if
[2:29:44] you've got it up on on poles or
[2:29:46] something it does look like a little
[2:29:48] wooden structure of some kind
[2:29:50] it could also look like a piece of
[2:29:52] stretch canvas
[2:29:54] it could also look like a little tent
[2:29:56] within the tent and he called it that
[2:29:58] once a tent within the tent interesting
[2:30:01] isn't it
[2:30:02] what I find interesting is the pillar of
[2:30:05] fire that was with him left him
[2:30:07] and went into that building
[2:30:10] I know you're weary here
[2:30:12] is this a slow slow go
[2:30:15] and a voice said to me
[2:30:22] that's powerful
[2:30:24] I'll meet you in there
[2:30:26] the same voice that caused to you and I
[2:30:28] to meet between the Cherry beams
[2:30:32] I will meet you there between the wings
[2:30:35] of the Cherry Bean come on behind the
[2:30:38] Riven Veil get in behind that Veil and
[2:30:40] I'll meet you there and listen to what
[2:30:43] brother Branham said that'll be the
[2:30:45] third pool when I meet you in that
[2:30:48] building
[2:30:49] when I meet you in that little room
[2:30:52] [Music]
[2:30:53] when the Lord meets you in that little
[2:30:56] tent
[2:30:57] [Music]
[2:30:59] that's why I said a few moments ago I
[2:31:02] believe that the third pool is more
[2:31:04] significant in the bride's Ministry
[2:31:09] that's why we didn't see the Fulfillment
[2:31:11] of the tent itself as brother Branham is
[2:31:14] still alive on the Earth
[2:31:16] that's why there are many people who
[2:31:18] believe that he will have to be raised
[2:31:20] from the dead I hate to even say this I
[2:31:23] hate to even tell this
[2:31:25] but it's true
[2:31:27] that's why there are men today who
[2:31:29] believe that brother random would have
[2:31:31] to raise from the dead and hold meetings
[2:31:33] under a tent
[2:31:35] for every word of thus saith the Lord to
[2:31:38] be fulfilled
[2:31:40] [Music]
[2:31:43] there's even an airplane
[2:31:46] sitting in an old forsaken field
[2:31:51] rusted out
[2:31:54] I got a picture
[2:31:58] waiting on the day that we need that
[2:32:01] airplane
[2:32:03] good brother random is finding a way to
[2:32:06] communicate with brothers so he talks to
[2:32:08] them about Aviation
[2:32:10] maybe we'll have one like that when we
[2:32:13] take that 10 around to the meeting so
[2:32:14] they go by the airplane
[2:32:16] that's okay that's okay don't you don't
[2:32:19] be critical
[2:32:20] that's okay
[2:32:22] all they knew is that he seemed to know
[2:32:24] everything
[2:32:25] that's right
[2:32:27] and so if he said it well that was
[2:32:29] enough for them I'm not against that
[2:32:32] they put the money in an account ready
[2:32:34] to buy the tent if brother Branham oh I
[2:32:37] can't believe I'm staying at this plane
[2:32:38] if brother random or the race from the
[2:32:40] dead well at least we know they'll have
[2:32:42] a tent and and I don't think I think
[2:32:44] they're going to buy a new airplane I
[2:32:45] believe I heard that that one is beyond
[2:32:47] repair now
[2:32:48] it's finally rusted out won't be much
[2:32:50] good who would think
[2:32:54] would think rain outpouring of the Holy
[2:32:56] Ghost that sweeps the bride in the
[2:32:59] Rapture to Eternity we're still going to
[2:33:02] need a dc-9 to get somewhere
[2:33:05] right mind would think that Delta is
[2:33:08] going to have to take us around we
[2:33:11] travel as a thought it wrapped your time
[2:33:13] we won't in an airplane
[2:33:17] we go back to the day of the first
[2:33:19] creation
[2:33:20] [Applause]
[2:33:22] whose authority is in our mouth
[2:33:25] we don't need no airplane
[2:33:29] we don't need a canvas tent
[2:33:33] [Music]
[2:33:35] you agree
[2:33:37] we don't even need brother Branham on
[2:33:40] the scene
[2:33:44] why because the voice of the Archangel
[2:33:48] is with us
[2:33:51] who is the US the bride of Christ the
[2:33:56] bride of Christ
[2:33:58] around the world
[2:34:00] so we don't have to go back and make
[2:34:02] these things work
[2:34:04] [Music]
[2:34:07] why did we even have that thought why
[2:34:09] did people even get under that thing
[2:34:11] because somebody was stopping up the
[2:34:13] whales
[2:34:18] always trying to make excuses and
[2:34:20] explain things away while the bride was
[2:34:23] just dwindling just dwindling just
[2:34:25] dwindling no power No Authority no
[2:34:28] healing no prayers answered come on dead
[2:34:31] Services dries them on come on just
[2:34:34] dwindling away to nothing but we're
[2:34:36] still doing our work
[2:34:39] we're still busy busy busy busy busy
[2:34:41] busy busy busy busy doesn't matter that
[2:34:44] nothing is being fulfilled among us
[2:34:46] we're still busy doing the king's work
[2:34:50] you're no better off in that shape than
[2:34:52] laodicea is
[2:34:54] where the bridegroom standing on the
[2:34:55] outside knocking to get in
[2:34:57] hello
[2:34:59] you're not winning anybody to Christ
[2:35:01] unless you're in Christ
[2:35:05] so many times the Bible talks about
[2:35:07] making people a twofold child children
[2:35:10] of hell because we bring them in and we
[2:35:12] have nothing to transform them
[2:35:19] come on
[2:35:22] it's 1 30.
[2:35:31] I'll meet you in there
[2:35:33] that'll be the third pool
[2:35:36] and in the beginning it would be
[2:35:38] just brother Branham and just that angel
[2:35:41] of the Lord
[2:35:42] that light
[2:35:44] I'll meet you in there I said why
[2:35:51] here was a man whose entire Ministry had
[2:35:54] been public
[2:35:55] why in there
[2:35:58] and here's what he said well it won't be
[2:36:02] a public show like the other what other
[2:36:04] first full second pool
[2:36:08] now in our mind we'd like to see more
[2:36:11] first pool
[2:36:13] and in our mind we'd like to see more
[2:36:15] second pool there'd be nothing wrong
[2:36:18] with that
[2:36:19] there'd be nothing wrong with telling
[2:36:21] people what was wrong with them
[2:36:23] that's a gift of the spirit a word of
[2:36:25] knowledge anybody with me no I don't
[2:36:27] know who I'm I feel like right now this
[2:36:29] just right here I feel like I'm
[2:36:30] preaching to people I'm not even looking
[2:36:31] at
[2:36:32] I just feel something almost
[2:36:34] Supernatural Happening Here Among Us
[2:36:37] this morning
[2:36:42] he knows what he's doing
[2:36:46] there's nothing wrong with first pool we
[2:36:49] we need uh I think that when you're able
[2:36:53] to by the word of knowledge tell
[2:36:55] somebody what's wrong with them
[2:36:57] I think it builds her faith
[2:37:00] I think it causes them to believe more
[2:37:02] than they were believing it sets an
[2:37:04] atmosphere
[2:37:06] but it's just a tool on the way
[2:37:11] second pool telling people their names
[2:37:14] don't you know your name
[2:37:18] stay with me don't you know your name
[2:37:21] do I really need to tell you what's
[2:37:22] wrong with you didn't you wake up this
[2:37:24] morning didn't you know when you got out
[2:37:27] of bed were you hurt I'm not I'm not
[2:37:29] making fun I'm going to function in any
[2:37:32] look here I feel this is how I feel Lord
[2:37:35] I'll do anything you want me to do if
[2:37:38] you want me to somehow tell somebody
[2:37:39] what's wrong with them I'll tell them if
[2:37:42] I need to if you want me to tell them
[2:37:43] their name
[2:37:46] it's happened
[2:37:48] it's happened
[2:37:50] next time you see Kevin McGregor ask him
[2:37:52] if it happened
[2:37:54] it's happened a time or two
[2:37:57] you ever hear from John Kuhn ask him if
[2:38:00] if it happens it happens happens if God
[2:38:04] wants me to tell or you you to tell
[2:38:06] somebody their name we're open for that
[2:38:09] but but the charismatic world has got
[2:38:11] something missing because they think if
[2:38:14] we can just get back to that place where
[2:38:17] we can tell people what's wrong with
[2:38:19] them they already know
[2:38:21] and then they if we could just get back
[2:38:23] to to where we could tell people their
[2:38:26] name and their and their address and and
[2:38:29] that's all right
[2:38:31] but that's not enough
[2:38:33] [Music]
[2:38:35] because there was more than a first pool
[2:38:37] and more than a second pool there was a
[2:38:39] third pool the first pool can be
[2:38:42] impersonated
[2:38:45] the second pool can be impersonated
[2:38:51] [Music]
[2:38:52] the third pull cannot be impersonated
[2:38:57] you can't fake that life
[2:39:00] you can fake the noise
[2:39:03] you can hoop and holler and carry on
[2:39:05] shout the loudest holler amen the
[2:39:07] loudest run the fastest dance the best
[2:39:12] but you cannot impersonate that third
[2:39:14] pool Ministry because that's you and him
[2:39:19] and part of that third pull I'm getting
[2:39:21] ahead of myself I'll have to finish this
[2:39:23] another time part of that third pull is
[2:39:25] bitter belly syndrome
[2:39:28] we're hard trials hard tests
[2:39:33] come on
[2:39:35] come on you see Popoff was here
[2:39:39] he was down here in
[2:39:42] Columbus some years ago
[2:39:44] they caught him impersonating the first
[2:39:47] pool
[2:39:49] this is not it was public knowledge
[2:39:52] he had a
[2:39:54] transistor
[2:39:56] remember this was years ago
[2:39:58] he had a transistor receiver in his ear
[2:40:02] and a little
[2:40:03] set behind the cat curtain
[2:40:06] and somebody working two or three people
[2:40:08] working the crowds
[2:40:11] we're so glad you came tell me about
[2:40:14] yourself what's your name are you sick
[2:40:16] did you need to be prayed for what's
[2:40:18] wrong with you
[2:40:19] my that's a nice yellow dress you have
[2:40:21] on sister
[2:40:23] and so he's hearing this in his ear
[2:40:27] then he comes out on the stage and he
[2:40:30] says you there some uh somewhere oh that
[2:40:32] yeah they're they're you sister there
[2:40:34] with a yellow dress
[2:40:37] that first pull they found out the city
[2:40:39] fathers they they contacted a lot of
[2:40:41] people come in they ran him out don't
[2:40:44] you ever come back to Columbus Georgia
[2:40:45] again now they've had kiss and everybody
[2:40:48] else after that you know the rock music
[2:40:50] and all but not not no charlatan fake
[2:40:52] preacher you know
[2:40:55] so the first pull can be impersonated
[2:40:59] brother Brandon was using prayer cards
[2:41:01] he never saw the prayer card
[2:41:03] he never held the prayer card
[2:41:05] he would have people to write it down as
[2:41:07] a witness but never see it and locked
[2:41:10] away
[2:41:12] and sometimes remember
[2:41:15] they tried to fool him
[2:41:17] and they wrote a bunch of things on a
[2:41:19] Prayer card they didn't have and they
[2:41:21] came through the prayer line thinking
[2:41:22] brother Brandon would name the things
[2:41:23] they thought he was cheating they
[2:41:25] thought he was a charlatan they thought
[2:41:27] he was faking and instead he walks over
[2:41:29] and he discerns there's nothing wrong
[2:41:31] with you there is nothing wrong with you
[2:41:33] but everything you wrote down on that
[2:41:35] prayer card you now have
[2:41:42] you can impersonate the first pull you
[2:41:45] can gain information about people sister
[2:41:47] Dorothy I don't know why I'm calling
[2:41:49] your name but we've been through some of
[2:41:50] this haven't we
[2:41:52] people we loved
[2:41:55] people we we respected and loved but
[2:41:58] they get off a little they they get
[2:42:00] under something and they start cheating
[2:42:03] [Music]
[2:42:05] it's dangerous yes it's dangerous
[2:42:08] but they start impersonating and
[2:42:11] cheating it
[2:42:12] and then they get over there and they so
[2:42:14] it's easy to impersonate that first pool
[2:42:16] you just gain information and you feed
[2:42:19] it back to the people in the name of the
[2:42:20] Lord here's the thing you must never
[2:42:22] forget God healed to many a person
[2:42:27] I want to make sure you understand
[2:42:29] because some of us have lived this and
[2:42:31] we saw it with our own eyes I've seen
[2:42:34] God heal many a person real heal real
[2:42:37] healing real Miracle under a phony
[2:42:40] preacher
[2:42:42] why would God do that because he honors
[2:42:45] his word and because he honors faith
[2:42:51] and because the anointing falls on the
[2:42:53] just and the unjust and because the
[2:42:55] gifts and callings of God are without
[2:42:57] repentance
[2:42:58] [Music]
[2:42:59] and a man can have a genuine anointing
[2:43:01] and a genuine call from God and be used
[2:43:03] falsely because he's false but the
[2:43:06] anointing that falls on a false vessel
[2:43:08] can be a true genuine anointing from the
[2:43:11] Lord and that's why it's not the false
[2:43:13] anointing
[2:43:15] it's not the false anointed it's the
[2:43:17] false anointed ones it's the people
[2:43:19] it's the life that's false
[2:43:22] but the anointing can be genuine
[2:43:25] and that second pool then you start
[2:43:27] start picking up there's many many ways
[2:43:30] look
[2:43:32] I don't want to get into them
[2:43:34] but there's ways that you can read
[2:43:36] someone and learn to read them and say
[2:43:38] something to them and by their response
[2:43:40] begin to figure things out
[2:43:43] so both first pull and second pool could
[2:43:45] be easily
[2:43:48] faked or impersonated
[2:43:50] but then there's the tent
[2:43:53] then there's the third pull then it's
[2:43:55] you and Jesus inside that place nobody
[2:43:58] and not you and the preacher in Jesus
[2:44:00] not you and the prophet in Jesus not you
[2:44:03] and brother Branham and Jesus just you
[2:44:05] and Jesus just you and the pillar of
[2:44:07] fire and inside there nobody's looking
[2:44:09] it's not a public show and when you pray
[2:44:12] you enter into the closet and close the
[2:44:14] door
[2:44:14] [Music]
[2:44:18] it's a secret place it's a place of
[2:44:21] intimacy it's a place of nakedness
[2:44:25] you can't hide anything then it's all in
[2:44:28] his eyes
[2:44:29] and he loves you more not less
[2:44:33] he sees your flaws and loves you more
[2:44:36] because you surrender to him and let him
[2:44:38] change you
[2:44:41] it's bitter in the valley sometime when
[2:44:44] this happens
[2:44:46] when that word gets down in there and
[2:44:48] starts correcting your life and telling
[2:44:50] you that I won't tolerate that no more
[2:44:54] you've got to make some changes in your
[2:44:55] wardrobe changes and your vocabulary
[2:44:58] changes
[2:45:01] it's not always Pleasant is it
[2:45:04] he said well it won't be a public show
[2:45:06] like the other and I came to it too and
[2:45:09] I now at the beginning of this New Year
[2:45:11] back to my Tabernacle where I started
[2:45:13] from
[2:45:15] see back to the beginning where I
[2:45:16] started I'm very grateful to God for
[2:45:18] these things and and many of you know
[2:45:21] that just before leaving on the other
[2:45:23] Crusade about eight or ten years I think
[2:45:26] about 10 years since nine years
[2:45:27] something like that these things were
[2:45:29] told exactly how the auditorium Services
[2:45:32] you remember exactly how brother Lawton
[2:45:35] would live exactly three years and then
[2:45:37] be taken away and brother Ward would
[2:45:39] build a tabernacle down in this position
[2:45:40] this direction and all just exactly you
[2:45:42] know you Old-Timers it happened just
[2:45:45] that way and so will this
[2:45:47] yes he's just pulling some history to
[2:45:50] show them this is what God did then
[2:45:53] and if he did it like that then it'll
[2:45:54] have to be like this now he said it
[2:45:56] happened just that way and so will this
[2:45:59] for it's thus saith the Lord and I want
[2:46:02] to emphasize the last three words
[2:46:05] because this is not just brother Branham
[2:46:07] in this reference as John was a type of
[2:46:10] the Bride brother Branham is serving in
[2:46:12] this as a type of the Bride
[2:46:18] John caught up brother Branham caught up
[2:46:22] to see something that wasn't happening
[2:46:24] in the natural
[2:46:26] and I want to emphasize those last three
[2:46:27] words and I'd like for you to read them
[2:46:29] out loud together please
[2:46:40] read it again
[2:46:45] and you'll know
[2:46:48] and now as I believe that at the brink
[2:46:50] of the greatest meetings
[2:46:52] I've ever held for the Lord Jesus is
[2:46:54] laying right in the future beginning now
[2:46:58] so you know I feel very happy this
[2:47:00] morning to come before you and this is
[2:47:02] the first time the message has ever been
[2:47:03] given out it's right here on this
[2:47:06] through the microphone to the Tabernacle
[2:47:08] people he's telling this vision
[2:47:11] and now it'll be in the papers the
[2:47:13] religious papers the voice of healing
[2:47:14] Herald of his coming in a few days it's
[2:47:16] already tight and ready to go pray for
[2:47:19] me
[2:47:21] now did you make it through that all
[2:47:22] right
[2:47:24] good I have another one I need to share
[2:47:25] with you before we go we're studying
[2:47:27] today we don't have a climax
[2:47:32] the climax is yet to come
[2:47:34] but I have to give you this
[2:47:37] in paragraph 389
[2:47:40] of is this the sign of the end sir are
[2:47:43] you still here do you need to stand up
[2:47:45] and stretch a minute it's 142.
[2:47:47] no no answer
[2:47:49] does that mean you're okay
[2:47:51] does it mean you'd like to stand up and
[2:47:53] stretch do it if you want to if you want
[2:47:55] to just pop up like a pop over just jump
[2:47:58] right up and stretch
[2:48:04] it's like a jack-in-the-box
[2:48:07] no takers
[2:48:13] paragraph 389.
[2:48:16] could it be
[2:48:20] or the seventh ain't angel in the seven
[2:48:25] constellation
[2:48:26] seventh period constellation
[2:48:30] their pyramid made in a form three on
[2:48:34] Assad and one on top three three and one
[2:48:37] dropped from eternity
[2:48:40] could it be he's describing
[2:48:44] the experience
[2:48:47] on the Sunset Ridge
[2:48:50] are what we call the sunset Mountain
[2:48:53] is he goes on is this the mystery of the
[2:48:57] Thunders
[2:48:58] that will bring back the headstone
[2:49:02] you know the pyramid never was capped
[2:49:07] could we read this sentence very
[2:49:09] carefully out loud together
[2:49:11] The Headstone is yet to come
[2:49:15] let's do it again The Headstone is yet
[2:49:19] to come
[2:49:21] when was this
[2:49:24] end of 62. so by the end of 62 The
[2:49:28] Headstone had not yet come and capped
[2:49:30] the pyramid we know that
[2:49:33] it's been rejected
[2:49:36] anybody remember the transvision
[2:49:40] it's been rejected
[2:49:42] a hand came and pushed that Cornerstone
[2:49:46] away that was to become the Capstone
[2:49:50] could it be Brethren sisters
[2:49:53] or is this that third pull that he told
[2:49:59] me
[2:50:00] three or four years ago
[2:50:02] the first pull you remember what
[2:50:04] happened I tried to explain it he said
[2:50:06] don't do that
[2:50:10] the second pull he said don't try and I
[2:50:13] pulled anyhow you remember congregation
[2:50:15] says yes all of you remember it's on
[2:50:18] tape and everything it is because I just
[2:50:20] read it to you didn't I and then he said
[2:50:22] now there's a third pool coming but
[2:50:25] don't try to explain it brother Branham
[2:50:29] was specifically forbidden to explain
[2:50:32] the third pull that doesn't mean that
[2:50:36] the bride shouldn't know what it is
[2:50:39] it means that brother Branham was
[2:50:42] specifically instructed not to explain
[2:50:45] it there is a bride re-digging the wells
[2:50:52] boring yes
[2:50:55] I gotta know it
[2:51:00] you see how I approach this tonight I
[2:51:02] don't know but I feel Duty bound to my I
[2:51:04] feel sorry for you people being here
[2:51:06] this long with a subject that's so
[2:51:08] tedious
[2:51:12] you see how I approach this tonight I
[2:51:14] don't know but I feel Duty bound to my
[2:51:15] church to say something
[2:51:17] you draw your own conclusion I find that
[2:51:22] an interesting statement uh especially
[2:51:24] around a bunch of people that say say
[2:51:26] what he said say what he said say what
[2:51:27] he said say what he said say what he
[2:51:28] said only what he said say what he said
[2:51:30] every word is thus saith the Lord say
[2:51:31] what he said
[2:51:35] and here is him
[2:51:37] saying you draw your own conclusion
[2:51:39] oh my brother Brandon believed that
[2:51:41] people could think
[2:51:44] he believed people could pray
[2:51:47] he believed people could hear from God
[2:51:49] they didn't get their orders from voice
[2:51:51] of God
[2:51:52] Incorporated
[2:51:55] they got him from
[2:51:57] the messenger
[2:52:00] well that was quiet
[2:52:03] they didn't have to get a Saturday text
[2:52:05] to tell them who they are and where
[2:52:06] they're going
[2:52:08] Friday went either
[2:52:11] now there's a third
[2:52:13] the third explain it you see how I
[2:52:15] approach this tonight I don't know but I
[2:52:17] feel Duty bound to my church to say
[2:52:18] something you draw your own conclusion
[2:52:20] and he goes on
[2:52:22] now will this be the mystery that would
[2:52:24] open up that would bring Christ bring a
[2:52:27] power to the church see we've we've
[2:52:29] already we believe in Repentance being
[2:52:31] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we
[2:52:34] believe in receiving the Holy Ghost we
[2:52:36] have signs wonders Miracles speaking in
[2:52:38] tongues and the things that the early
[2:52:40] church had
[2:52:43] and frankly there's been more done right
[2:52:46] here
[2:52:52] Vince wrote In the book of Acts
[2:52:55] that's powerful statement to make
[2:52:59] I'll tell you brother random made some
[2:53:01] pretty incredible statements he said
[2:53:03] about those little prayer calls he said
[2:53:05] I've had more success in my Ministry
[2:53:07] with those little prayer calls and I did
[2:53:09] with prayer lines
[2:53:13] bet you want one now thank you
[2:53:21] he said there was more happened right
[2:53:23] here in this little group of people than
[2:53:24] you read about in the book of Acts
[2:53:26] he said that one in this one little
[2:53:28] group of people this little bitty
[2:53:29] Ministry of ours here
[2:53:30] what about the world over see more than
[2:53:33] is wrote In the book of Acts same kind
[2:53:34] the raising of the Dead remember there
[2:53:36] was only about three people raised of
[2:53:38] the Dead by Jesus Christ and we have on
[2:53:40] record doctors record five
[2:53:44] that's Greater Works
[2:53:46] that's what Jesus said
[2:53:48] let me go into my father let me get on
[2:53:50] out of here I can do more from there
[2:53:51] than here
[2:53:54] you're going to do works that you've
[2:53:56] seen me doing Greater Works if I can get
[2:53:57] out of here isn't that what he said
[2:54:00] you see the bride will have a greater
[2:54:02] Ministry
[2:54:09] he was in one person then he's in the
[2:54:11] whole church now
[2:54:15] he said work said I do more than this
[2:54:17] shall you do I know the King James says
[2:54:19] greater but you couldn't do nothing
[2:54:20] greater he says it's more of it
[2:54:24] that's good that's greater
[2:54:27] he was in one person then he's in the
[2:54:29] whole church now see more than this
[2:54:30] shall you do for I go unto my father if
[2:54:33] oh yeah if this is
[2:54:37] the third pool
[2:54:39] then there is a great ministry lying
[2:54:43] ahead I don't know I can't say I don't
[2:54:47] know hmm
[2:54:49] let's go back
[2:54:51] let's go back
[2:54:53] I don't know I can't say I don't know
[2:55:00] a lot of my brethren say that was
[2:55:01] brother Brandon being humble
[2:55:03] you've got to read between the lines
[2:55:08] he's talking about his own Ministry I
[2:55:10] don't believe that
[2:55:13] I believe when he said I don't know I
[2:55:16] can't say I don't know I believe he
[2:55:19] meant I don't know I can't say I don't
[2:55:24] know because it's not all been revealed
[2:55:26] to me yet
[2:55:30] they believe a lot of people believe
[2:55:31] he's just being humble
[2:55:34] look it's too late it's uh it's getting
[2:55:36] late now
[2:55:37] it's too late it was too late then his
[2:55:40] ministry was coming to an end
[2:55:42] he didn't have much time just to put on
[2:55:44] some kind of humility
[2:55:46] he said I don't know is this a third
[2:55:47] pull then there's if this is the third
[2:55:49] bull there's a great ministry I don't
[2:55:51] know I can't say I don't know all right
[2:55:53] let's go on
[2:55:54] watch third pool that's paragraph 399.
[2:56:00] let's stop on that a minute in division
[2:56:03] the first flight
[2:56:05] was little messenger Birds this is
[2:56:07] sunset again
[2:56:09] was little messenger birds that was when
[2:56:11] we first started it growed from just
[2:56:13] taking a person by the hand
[2:56:16] and you remember when he told me if
[2:56:18] you'll be sincere it'll come to pass
[2:56:19] that you'll know the very secret of
[2:56:21] their heart how many remembers that
[2:56:23] announced from here and across the
[2:56:25] Nations and it and did it happen amen
[2:56:28] exactly then said Don't Fear I'll be
[2:56:30] with you see and it shall go on now the
[2:56:33] first pull was little bitty birds in
[2:56:35] flights they went on to meet the time
[2:56:37] meet the coming of the Lord the first
[2:56:39] message
[2:56:40] the second time the secrets of the heart
[2:56:42] that's the first pull second pool and he
[2:56:45] is
[2:56:46] connecting
[2:56:49] the three parts of the tent vision
[2:56:53] to the visitation of Angels in the
[2:56:55] desert
[2:56:59] remember when he first saw them
[2:57:01] he said they were like little birds he
[2:57:04] was even confused on how many there was
[2:57:06] to start with then they they were no
[2:57:09] longer just Little Birds now they're
[2:57:11] grown angels grown men like Angels
[2:57:14] hovering above
[2:57:15] in the one to my right
[2:57:17] remember what he said are you familiar
[2:57:20] with the with the sunset experience I
[2:57:22] can read that to you sometime we don't
[2:57:24] have time today why does it matter
[2:57:26] because we're fixing to walk in the rest
[2:57:28] of this stuff
[2:57:30] wait a minute I'm going to say that
[2:57:31] again
[2:57:34] from taking a person by the hand and
[2:57:36] just standing there and saying what they
[2:57:37] had the next time it revealed their sins
[2:57:39] and told them what to do let's go on uh
[2:57:42] is that right and then that come to pass
[2:57:44] perfectly just as God said in your my
[2:57:47] Witnesses and so is the world and so is
[2:57:49] the church
[2:57:50] and when I said I saw an angel and it
[2:57:53] was an emerald fire burning people
[2:57:55] laughed
[2:57:58] now he's using the word Emerald here he
[2:58:01] often called it Amber
[2:58:03] which is a very similar color golden
[2:58:07] brownish greenish
[2:58:10] he said people laughed and said Billy
[2:58:13] get get next to yourself or get a hold
[2:58:15] of yourself that the magic scientific
[2:58:17] eye of the camera took it I wasn't lying
[2:58:19] I was telling the truth god vindicates
[2:58:22] brother Brandon was almost driven to an
[2:58:24] entire nervous breakdown because of what
[2:58:27] the people were saying so God had to
[2:58:29] keep building him and building him
[2:58:31] I said Darkness overshadows it's death
[2:58:33] black and this is white and one is life
[2:58:36] the other's death and there it is on the
[2:58:38] picture back there he's talking about
[2:58:40] the photograph the pillar of fire as
[2:58:44] George g j Lacey said the mechanical eye
[2:58:47] of this camera won't take psychology
[2:58:50] are you following me so brother Branham
[2:58:53] truly believed that it was a
[2:58:55] supernatural being that was captured on
[2:58:57] that photograph he said notice and I'm
[2:59:00] almost done because I can't stand much
[2:59:02] longer notice the first little flight
[2:59:05] hand the second was greater wider doves
[2:59:09] Holy Spirit revealing the secrets of the
[2:59:11] heart and the third flight was Angels
[2:59:13] not birds and that's the end time that's
[2:59:16] all of it will this be the time brother
[2:59:19] is this the time
[2:59:22] not one time did he say this is the time
[2:59:28] every time he said is this the time is
[2:59:31] this what God is going to do
[2:59:33] he said now listen real close and don't
[2:59:35] misinterpret this I want to ask you
[2:59:37] something let's just go back a minute
[2:59:38] the church knows it's the truth the
[2:59:40] scientific world knows it's the truth
[2:59:44] and people sitting here tonight and many
[2:59:46] still living that we're standing here on
[2:59:48] the river listen
[2:59:49] 90 years ago today
[2:59:52] standing here on the river when that
[2:59:54] voice spoke out and said as John was
[2:59:57] sent forth with a message of the first
[2:59:59] coming so so this so is this the second
[3:00:02] message of the second coming remember he
[3:00:04] doesn't quote it
[3:00:06] verbatim here
[3:00:11] don't let that throw you off
[3:00:13] he's into something else
[3:00:15] and if it's finished what did John do
[3:00:19] John was the one who said behold there's
[3:00:21] the Lamb of God that takes away the sin
[3:00:23] of the world that's him it's the hour
[3:00:25] has it arrived my brethren
[3:00:30] if brother Brandon was under the same
[3:00:32] anointing as John the Baptist brother
[3:00:33] Branham knew what that was going to mean
[3:00:35] for him
[3:00:36] [Music]
[3:00:37] it meant he was going to have to go by
[3:00:39] the way of the Grave because John the
[3:00:41] Baptist had his head chopped off I must
[3:00:43] decrease he must increase that's why
[3:00:45] brother Branham has these questions he
[3:00:48] said is the hour hasn't arrived my
[3:00:49] brethren I don't say it has
[3:00:55] but I'm asking you I want you to think
[3:00:57] will this be the time when it will be
[3:00:59] again Behold the Lamb of God
[3:01:02] or the time of Malachi 4 to return the
[3:01:05] hearts of the children back to the Faith
[3:01:07] of Our Fathers will it be such a blast
[3:01:09] that will do such Mighty things until it
[3:01:12] will set the church has been sloping and
[3:01:13] cannot understand the mysteries of God
[3:01:15] and so forth slopping when they see the
[3:01:18] mighty blast sweep for when it turn
[3:01:20] their hearts back to the father as the
[3:01:22] Bible said it would do remember brother
[3:01:24] Branham was thinking that his death was
[3:01:27] coming in one or two places by explosion
[3:01:34] he said or was this the message already
[3:01:36] passed that should have done it ah I
[3:01:39] don't
[3:01:41] know
[3:01:43] but here's one thing he did know
[3:01:46] it's not two o'clock
[3:01:50] he knew that this is the sign of the end
[3:01:53] time sirs
[3:01:57] and he asked the people or
[3:02:00] is this the sign that it's over
[3:02:03] it looks very scriptural to me I don't
[3:02:05] know there were them Angels there was a
[3:02:07] blast like a thunder That Shook the
[3:02:09] whole Earth
[3:02:10] God knows I tell the truth just remember
[3:02:13] something is fixing to happen I don't
[3:02:14] know what it is but could this could it
[3:02:16] be this the reason I say this prepare
[3:02:19] yourselves let us pray take our position
[3:02:21] in the army of his Believers and prepare
[3:02:24] ourselves for it may be later than we're
[3:02:29] thinking
[3:02:41] time will not permit me to go on
[3:02:44] come musicians please the next one is
[3:02:46] really long too
[3:02:51] you'll have to come back
[3:02:53] and we will tie this together
[3:02:56] it's really loose it's really loose to
[3:02:59] leave it like this but I need to do that
[3:03:01] for your sake
[3:03:03] and mind
[3:03:05] but come on back
[3:03:07] because we're going to tie this third
[3:03:09] pool
[3:03:10] into every one of those phases that John
[3:03:13] experienced eat the book
[3:03:16] sweet in the mouth bitter in the belly
[3:03:19] prophesy again
[3:03:22] I know that some of us are tired I don't
[3:03:25] mean this morning I know you're tired
[3:03:26] this morning and these
[3:03:28] long-winded preachers that
[3:03:31] don't do nothing all week and lay around
[3:03:35] and rest and we're all worn out from
[3:03:38] work and then they come in here on
[3:03:39] Sunday and preach three hours and
[3:03:42] take their big check home and
[3:03:50] it's a whole lot more to it than that
[3:03:52] and you know it I'm being facetious
[3:04:00] I feel oh I feel him
[3:04:03] I feel him I know it's not a feeling but
[3:04:06] I feel him I feel him running up my
[3:04:08] forearms and through my elbows and into
[3:04:11] my shoulders I feel that presence of God
[3:04:14] moving like vibration around me
[3:04:17] Hallelujah to his name it's him it is
[3:04:21] not us it's not this church it's not you
[3:04:25] it's not it's him it's him this is what
[3:04:28] he has promised to accomplish in the end
[3:04:31] time we're going to come out of that
[3:04:34] little room we're coming out of that
[3:04:36] little tent just like him
[3:04:42] you see it can't be impersonated first
[3:04:44] pull yes second pool yes third pool
[3:04:47] cannot be impersonated you cannot
[3:04:50] hypocrite the character and life of
[3:04:54] Jesus Christ
[3:04:56] can't do it
[3:04:58] it'll show it'll show it'll show you can
[3:05:02] come to church and hypocrite it
[3:05:05] you can come to church and live so holy
[3:05:08] holy holy holy
[3:05:11] but somebody's gonna see you
[3:05:18] yeah that's real good for you
[3:05:21] I lay under my dining room table not not
[3:05:25] the one that's in my home now but the
[3:05:27] one that's most likely still sitting in
[3:05:30] Sister Jan's dining room
[3:05:36] that was my dining room table then
[3:05:39] she may not have it anymore I don't know
[3:05:43] but I was laying under that dining room
[3:05:45] table
[3:05:46] in my home in my dining room
[3:05:49] crying out to God
[3:05:52] in the wee hour of the morning some
[3:05:54] years ago
[3:05:55] when I saw a friend
[3:06:00] standing on the beach
[3:06:02] with another friend
[3:06:07] they were not facing me
[3:06:09] I caught the man's demeanor and shape
[3:06:12] and and and knew who he was
[3:06:16] I did not know at the time
[3:06:20] who the woman was until she turned
[3:06:22] toward me
[3:06:24] and when she turned toward me in the
[3:06:26] vision I saw who it was and I knew that
[3:06:30] she was a married woman
[3:06:32] and that this was not her husband
[3:06:36] God gave me I'm not boasting
[3:06:39] you can take this right out of the tape
[3:06:41] right out of the archive
[3:06:45] does it need to be here
[3:06:48] but God gave me the city
[3:06:52] he gave me the phone number
[3:06:55] I had a list of phone numbers given to
[3:06:58] me by an operator
[3:07:00] he highlighted the phone number by the
[3:07:03] name of the hotel
[3:07:07] he let me call that number
[3:07:10] ask for my friend
[3:07:13] and the room rang
[3:07:24] he is the same
[3:07:28] yesterday today and forever
[3:07:31] you'll somebody will find you on a beach
[3:07:34] somewhere
[3:07:36] somebody will see you off behind the
[3:07:39] store or parked in your car
[3:07:42] doing something you ought not to do
[3:07:45] somebody will smell it on your breath
[3:07:52] it may take a long time
[3:07:54] but you can't hypocrite this life
[3:07:57] forever
[3:07:58] be sure your sins will find you out
[3:08:05] so the first pull can be impersonated
[3:08:08] second pool impersonated but the life
[3:08:12] and character of Jesus Christ in its
[3:08:15] fullness can never be phonied it can
[3:08:18] never be faked
[3:08:21] it will eventually come out your temper
[3:08:24] will get the best of you your cheating
[3:08:27] will come out
[3:08:32] somebody will see it on your phone it
[3:08:36] you'll not be able to hide it
[3:08:43] so get out from under the pressure and
[3:08:47] run into the tent
[3:08:51] run into Christ
[3:08:54] hide with him
[3:08:57] let him change you from glory to glory
[3:09:01] from Faith to Faith from strength to
[3:09:05] strength
[3:09:07] there is a bride
[3:09:10] who will come forth in these last days
[3:09:14] from that tent just like him
[3:09:22] brother Brandon was seeing some of it
[3:09:26] this is what makes them so mad
[3:09:30] he was seeing some of it
[3:09:33] but he was not seeing all of it
[3:09:39] one of the reasons is he said if Satan
[3:09:42] gets a hold of this
[3:09:45] he could do much damage with this
[3:09:49] you hear Brother bam say I don't know I
[3:09:51] do not know I am not sure is this it I'm
[3:09:54] not sure if this is it is this the
[3:09:55] beginning is this the end I am not sure
[3:09:59] until Sabino Canyon he didn't know
[3:10:02] whether the explosion was going to be
[3:10:04] his death
[3:10:05] or whether it was going to be another
[3:10:07] installment of his ministry it ended up
[3:10:10] being another installment of his
[3:10:12] ministry that actually introduced the
[3:10:14] bride
[3:10:16] had it not been for that we wouldn't
[3:10:18] have really been introduced to the
[3:10:19] fullness of the word he had to come all
[3:10:21] the way through that so we could really
