While she plays that softly this morning, who would have an unspoken prayer request just by the uplifting of the hand, there's needs all over this building. We want to remember everybody out of town traveling. I know some of them are traveling back today and some of them throughout the week. So, let's just remember all of them and every hand that went up. Crystalin and Adelaide and Lydia, I believe they're all sick. We remember them to the Lord. Brother Ellas is not feeling well today. Let us know that he wouldn't be here. We want to pray for him. Sister Beverly was going to the urgent care [music] uh with uh problem that needed to be looked after. Let's ask the Lord to minister to her. We want to remember the family. Mr. passed away and was 98 years old, but he passed and we want to remember his family and we want to remember sister Lydia Whitmire. The Lord will lay his hand upon her as well as sister Alfreda. The Lord will strengthen her, give them courage in this hour. [music] The Lord sees those needs that they have. &gt;&gt; Brother Nathan, would you mind coming and praying today? Let's just sing that again. Falling in love with Jesus. I'm falling in love with Jesus. Falling in love with Jesus was the best thing I've ever done. In his arms I feel protected.

Thank you, Lord, that you protect us. &gt;&gt; That everything that happens to us is for a reason. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus, that you have a plan and a purpose for my life. &gt;&gt; Lord, all these needs that are represented, nearly every hand in the building went up. Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; so many on the stream. Lord, I ask that you would just go to each need. For each person that needs healing, I ask Lord Jesus that you would move on their behalf. For you are the healer. &gt;&gt; For each person that is seeking answers, oh Lord, you are the answer. For each person that is grieving, you said, "I'm the comforter." &gt;&gt; I ask, oh Lord, that you would just move for each need that's represented in this house today and over the stream. And I ask Lord as the word goes forth today that you would speak to our hearts. Lord move in our lives. May our ears be attentive to hear what you would have to say to each one of us. Oh Lord, be with that as he ministers that your words would flow through him. Lord, for all of those that are traveling, I ask that you would give them safety on the roadways. Lord, let every step of each person, let them be guided by you. We want to walk in your perfect will. Oh Lord, help us to stay in the vision. &gt;&gt; We ask all these things in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sing this little chorus with me.

Aren't you thankful that the price is already paid? &gt;&gt; Victory is already won. &gt;&gt; We're just stepping into the appropriation of that victory that he has already won on our behalf. It's good to see you in the house of the Lord today. Thank you for being here. It's not nearly as empty as I expected it to be. &gt;&gt; Jennifer, I think you traveled nearly all night. Well, midnight. Well, we're glad that you came back. The Lord bless you for being here today. We're just glad to be in the house of the Lord. Sing this song before we look to the word. When I first fell in love with Jesus, I gave him all of my heart. [music and singing] And I thought that I couldn't love him anymore than I did right from the start. Now I look back over the mountains and the valleys where I've been. It makes me know that I love him so much more than I did then. And I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again. I keep falling in love with Jesus over and over and over again. He gets sweeter and sweeter. The days go by. Oh, what a love between my Lord and I. I keep falling in love with him. Over and over and over and over again. There's a hand that I hold on to through each [music] valley and each trial. There's a shoulder that I lean upon as I face another mile. There's a love [music] that I can depend on. It's fresh and new each day. And with love, my heart is overflowing. That is why I say, [music] "Oh, I keep falling in love with Jesus over and over again. I keep falling in love with Jesus over and over, over and over again. He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by. Oh, what a love between my Lord and I. I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again. Oh, I keep falling in love with Jesus. [music] Over and over again. I keep falling in love with Jesus over and over and over and over again. He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days. Oh, what a love between my Lord and I. I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again. I am so grateful that I don't have to fall out of love with him &gt;&gt; to fall in love with him over and over again. But he is so spectacular, so large, so varied in his in his presentation of himself that he presents himself in another way and another way and another way and another way and I just fall in love with him all over again. He's that good. We're glad that you're here today. We're so thankful for Mary Beth and Joshua. Didn't he do a good job for us today leading us in worship? We're so appreciative. Mary Best said that she didn't ever remember playing without somebody else to accompany her. And so we're grateful to have her here today. We're blessed to have all the musicians that we do have and we sure miss them. But I'm glad that God didn't have to only be in one place at one time. &gt;&gt; I'm glad he can be here today. [snorts] &gt;&gt; While you're standing, let's look to the scripture today. Colossians chapter 1. Thank you. Colossians chapter 1. verses 19- 27. Colossians chapter 1 verse 19. For it pleased the father that in him him who Jesus Christ should all fullness dwell. and having made peace through the blood of his cross. by him to reconcile all things unto himself. By him I say, whether they be things in earth or things in heaven. And you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight. If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven, whereof I, Paul, am made a minister, who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his body's sake, which is the church, whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God, which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God, even the mystery which hath been hidden from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints, to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles. s which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Before you're seated, let's pray once again. Our Father, we're presenting ourselves for service today. We want to thank you for the Holy Spirit that is here. Your spirit that you have allowed to be in our midst today as we carry you with us. Lord, we thank you that your presence has increased here in the house. For each one that has gathered, I thank you for them. Those out across the stream, [snorts] I thank you for them. And we're just settling down now, Lord, to look into your word, how it may help us, strengthen us, guide us, equip us for end time strategy. I pray, Father, that you will help us now as we look into your word, that you would hide the vessel and that you would speak to us from your word, your written word. May it not be letters on a page, but may it become living reality to us and in us. We pray today for our pastor and for all of those that are there in Indiana, even some that'll be traveling this afternoon. We pray God that you will speak your divine word there among those people as they travel home. Bring them safely to us. I pray we give you the honor and the glory, the high seat in the house &gt;&gt; for that is what you deserve. Any distraction, any disturbing spirit, we take authority over it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Even the few in number that we are, we we move it out of the way as a distraction. And we thank you, Lord, that you are present in the house to speak your word to us. We give you praise for it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you as you have your seat today. So, as we're reading this scripture again today, it has just been a few short weeks ago that Brother Shelley was uh ministering from some of these verses, but today I would like to zero in on verse 24. Uh my wife provoked study of this verse. What does it mean? So we're looking at let's back up and get a phrase of verse 23. Whereof I Paul am made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake which is the church. Now I would like to take the word just a moment the word afflictions because Paul of course was a man who suffered many things along his journey in his walk with the Lord while he was on the earth. The scripture talks about there were people that were discussing the uh how great they were and Paul wanted to get his words in there as well because he wanted to know that he wasn't uh just somebody that had just started the race. He wanted to demonstrate that he was a Pharisee among Pharisees. When it came to the word, he was not stupid. &gt;&gt; He was not uneducated or unlearned. &gt;&gt; And even when he said, "I had to forget all I knew to find Christ," that doesn't mean he forgot all of the scripture that he ever knew. &gt;&gt; He had to forget his theology that went along with it. all of the hours of studying and all of the all of the ways that it was interpreted in time past. That was what he had to forget. He didn't have to forget the scripture because everything that we do, everything that we say, everything that we live, it has to be based in the scripture. &gt;&gt; That's and so he was Pharisee among Pharisees. and and he talked about being shipwrecked and he talked about going after the Christian believers to to put them to death and he talks about all of these things that he experienced and and then [snorts] he talks about his sufferings after he came to the Lord Jesus and he is he is now presenting it to this uh church of the Colossians and he's telling them I was made a minister and and I Now you can re uh you rejoice in my sufferings or I rejoice rather in my sufferings for you and I fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh not for his own self but for the body's sake which is the church. Now the word afflictions there is the Greek word flips and it means press or pressing together and it comes from the previous Greek word meaning to press as grapes or to press hard upon. We can find this Greek word used in other places such as in Matthew 13 18- 21 when Jesus said, "Hear ye therefore the parable of the swer." When anyone heareth the word of the kingdom and understands it not, then comes the wicked one and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the wayside. But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he that hears the word &gt;&gt; and anon with joy. &gt;&gt; He receives it. Yet [snorts] &gt;&gt; the word doesn't have any root in him, &gt;&gt; but he endures for a while. For when tribulation pressing for when pressing or persecution arises because of the word by and by he is offended. &gt;&gt; So here we see when the word seed of God comes into certain people they endure for a while. They can't last for a long period of time. You see, the scripture says, "He that endures to the end, the same shall be saved." &gt;&gt; And and here is one that the word got to them or in them in some way, but it didn't it wasn't able to take root in them the way it would take root in good soil. And so as the word is uh it's in them perhaps on a on a rock uh anybody that has been around for a while and seen uh agriculture of any sort and seen the word seen seed that maybe fell on a rock that had a little bit of dirt on it. it would sprout, might even grow a while. But because it had no depth, it could only get so far. &gt;&gt; And that is what Jesus is using to uh to demonstrate here somebody that goes for a little while, but then he says there's no root. And when tribulation or when the pressing starts happening, &gt;&gt; when the pressing or the persecution arises because of the word, he is offended. Now this is not a seasoned believer. This is not one who has good ground that the seed were. This is somebody who uh is sprouted up may even sprouted up quickly but after a while they couldn't endure because of the pressing that has come along. John 16:33 uses this same word where Jesus said, "These things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace." In the world, you shall have tribulation, pressing in the world. There's no may about it. You shall have pressing. But be of good cheer. I have overcome the world. &gt;&gt; All right. I I want US TO GET PAST I WANT US TO GET PAST uh this when we see this word tribulation. I want us to get past uh making that synonymous with suffering. I want us to see that this is God's way to press us into our identity. I want us to see that this is God's way of pressing us into our destiny. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pressing us by the tribulations that come our way. But he said we could have peace in this world that we were sure that tribulations or pressings were going to come. It's part of our our journey in the Lord. That pressing is going to come. And and and but he said you be of good cheer. That's right. &gt;&gt; KEEP YOUR SMILE on in the pressing. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE HAS OVERCOME the world. We just sang. It's already done. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; It would be lovely to know that we never had to go through another trial, &gt;&gt; another pressing, &gt;&gt; but we sing it's already done knowing that Jesus Christ already finished his work. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now it's being appropriated through us. &gt;&gt; Acts 14 also uses this word verses 21 and 22. When me when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many, they returned again to Lististra and to Iconium and Antioch, confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith. Now, I want you to know this is not a Catholic confirming. This is they wanted to see the goods of believers that were walking in the truth [snorts] exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must go through much pressing to enter in to the kingdom of God. There again, the word tribulation is the pressing scripture that we're very familiar with in Romans chapter 5:es 1-5. Therefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access by faith into this grace, wherein we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God. And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also. Should we all stand up and clap? [laughter] &gt;&gt; Because of the pressure that we get to endure. &gt;&gt; Not only so, but we glory in tribulations. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Why would we glory in tribulation? Why would we glory in pressure? Pressure seems to be something THAT CAUSES US TO GET OFFENDED AND TO POP OFF AT THE MOUTH AND DO OTHER crazy things that we don't really want anybody to see. &gt;&gt; BUT THE WORD IS telling us we know that these pressings are working patience. If you don't ever get the pressings, you don't get the patience. We know that the pressing works patience and patience works experience and experience works hope. and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us. Let's read another one in 2 Corinthians chapter 1 verses 3-8. We're going somewhere. Blessed be the God, even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforteth us in all our tribulation presses, [snorts] &gt;&gt; that we may be able to comfort them which are in trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted. He comforts us in the times of our pressings, tribulations, in order that we may be able to comfort those &gt;&gt; that are also going through pressings as we have. &gt;&gt; When you go through a tribulation, it's not because God hates you. IT IS NOT BECAUSE THAT HE doesn't want you to be your best. &gt;&gt; It is BECAUSE HE WANTS YOU TO COME THROUGH IT with shining colors &gt;&gt; in order that you and I may be able to comfort the next one that we see going through a tribulation that we can be their cheerleader &gt;&gt; TO SAY, "GOD GAVE ME GRACE. I know that he'll give you grace. &gt;&gt; WE'RE PAST IT, FRIENDS, where that WE SAY, "GOD GAVE ME GRACE TO GET THROUGH IT. You may as well have the same stuff I had." NO, IT IS SO THAT WE CAN BY GRACE we can come ALL THE WAY THROUGH THAT WE MAY COMFORT THE NEXT one that we see is under the same pressure, under the same pressing that we were under so that we can encourage THEM AND SAY THE GOD OF ALL GRACE. He gave me the grace TO GO THROUGH. HE'S GOING TO GIVE YOU the grace to go through. We've got to keep reading. FOR AS THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST ABOUND in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ. And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation. Now, I want you to I want you to notice as we're reading this scripture that that Jesus already went through suffering. But I WANT YOU TO KEEP IN mind what our pastor has been trying to tell us ABOUT THE END TIME BRIDAL COMPANY, the Messiah. NOW &gt;&gt; THEY ARE NOT GOING THROUGH this world through this life WITH WITH NO TRIALS, no temptations, no no afflictions, NO TRIBULATIONS. THEY'RE GOING through uh getting all of these, receiving all of these by the hand of God because we are his body &gt;&gt; in the earth in the end time. &gt;&gt; Amen. SO AS THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST ABOUND in us, so our consolation also aboundeth in Christ. Now I want you to remember also that again we are not Catholic. WE ARE NOT GOING OUT AND ASKING for all kinds of sufferings to come to us because we're doing penance. THAT'S NONSENSE. JESUS CHRIST paid the price that we don't have to go through that kind of suffering and pain that he went through. But he's allowing us to go through things in our life to bring us into a mature state &gt;&gt; because as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation abounds by Christ. Whether we be afflicted, watch this, it is for your consolation and salvation, &gt;&gt; which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer. &gt;&gt; Or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation. and our hope of you is steadfast, knowing that as you are partakers of the suffering, &gt;&gt; so shall you also be of the consolation. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the tribulation, the pressing that is happening, it is working something inside of us that we may be demonstrators of Christ life &gt;&gt; in the end time to those who are being pressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. a pressing maybe that you have already gone through and you have come through by the comfort of the Holy Ghost, by the comfort of another brother or sister who encouraged you along the way. Now you have gone through that and you are carrying &gt;&gt; these entities these these characteristics inside of you so that you may be a consolation a comfort to someone else. Amen. &gt;&gt; FOR WE WOULD NOT, BRETHREN, have you ignorant of our trouble, which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure above strength, in so much that we despared even of life. So we have established in these scriptures that there are places that use this same Greek word to describe afflictions. Now I would like to now return to Colossians chapter 1 verse 24. And I would like to read to you verse 24 in the amplified so that we can get a further understanding of what we're talking about. Colossians 1:24 in the amplified. Even now I rejoice in the midst of my sufferings on your behalf and in my own person I am making up whatever is still lacking and remains to be completed on our part of Christ's affliction for the sake of his body which is the church. Now again, we have not been called to do penance. That is that is not part of the scripture. What I do want to point out is that there is apparently something that remains to be completed of Christ in the earth in the end time. There is something that has to be completed and that completion is going to come through the bride of Jesus Christ. And the bride of Jesus Christ is not just somebody that he dropped on a church pew and said, "You're good enough to handle what I've called you to." &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be lovely? &gt;&gt; Just to be dropped into a position, be fully equipped all at once. That would be that would be so marvelous to you know a lot of people that talk about being put in a position of a job where that they were basically dropped head first into their position and nobody taught them anything and they had to learn it as they went and and uh it was uh it was not an easy process but after a while through uh humps and bumps and mistakes they they got to that they learned their position quite Well, well, that's kind of how we are as believers. We we got dropped in head first and [snorts] uh we we we thought that when we accepted the Lord Jesus as our savior that we would uh everything would be just exactly all right and it it will be. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, to to know that you're born again, to know that you've been saved uh by the by the blood of Jesus Christ, that you don't have to take stripes or die a physical death. We're in a partnership with him. &gt;&gt; And we're in a partnership with his death. Paul said, "I die daily." We're in a partnership with his death. We don't have to be put in a grave. He did that. We don't have to take stripes on our back. He did that. We don't HAVE TO HANG ON A CROSS. He did that. We are entering into a partnership with his sufferings knowing that as as he died the physical death he gave his blood that we could be redeemed to him. He wanted us to be in a partnership with him where that we are willing to also die to self. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS HIS FINAL battle in the garden of Gethsemane? Not my will but thy will be done. Amen. &gt;&gt; And as believers, we've heard it over and over again in OUR JOURNEY THAT THAT IS EXACTLY what is happening with us. We're having a garden of Gethsemane nearly every day. &gt;&gt; Not my will but thine be done. We're dying. We're dying to self. We're partakers as as uh 2 Corinthians 1:7 said, "We're a partner. We're an associate. We're a comrade. We're a companion. We're a sharer of these things uh that Jesus suffered. And again, we're not seeing how much we can suffer. We're not going to look for sufferings. We're not we're not trying to see how bloody we can get. Sometimes we feel blooded. But we are not trying to draw blood. We'll leave that to the doctors. We are trying to come into a partnership with the Lord Jesus Christ. We read in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 6-18, for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus. But we have this treasure in earthn vessels. Amen. &gt;&gt; That the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. &gt;&gt; God our creator is getting the glory not mankind. &gt;&gt; Paul continues to write, "We are troubled on every side yet not distressed. We are perplexed but not in despair. Persecuted but not forsaken. &gt;&gt; Cast down but not destroyed. &gt;&gt; Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus. always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus. And what is the purpose of the dying? That the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body. This is not to be showoff. This is not to be able to toot your horn uh that you have exceeded or excelled someone else. This is uh this is about glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ in our life so that the life of Jesus might be made manifest and displayed to those around us. For we are always, we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. Oh, we live, [snorts] we're always delivered to death for Jesus' sake for a particular reason, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest when we get back in our glorified bodies. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; I threw something at you there. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT WAITING TILL WE GET BACK in our glorified bodies. &gt;&gt; This is so that we MIGHT MANIFEST JESUS CHRIST IN THE BODY THAT WE NOW live in. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's going to be good when we ALL HAVE OUR GLORIFIED bodies and we're all together and there's no more sin. But Jesus came that we COULD HAVE LIFE AND THAT WE COULD HAVE IT more abundantly so that WE COULD DEMONSTRATE THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST in this mortal body that we now live. We don't He doesn't want us to wait until the glorified body or the theophony BODY. HE WANTS US TO manifest that life of Jesus Christ while we live in this mortal body. WE CAN'T JUST EXIST THE NUMBER OF years that we've been given and hope that everything's going to be okay. NO, WE'VE GOT TO EMBRACE the pressure that comes, THE TRIBULATION THAT COMES our way. Because this pressing that is happening is because he wants to make manifest in my mortal flesh the very nature the character THE DEMONSTRATION OF Jesus &gt;&gt; in the earth in the end time. So then death workketh in us but life in you. We having the same spirit of faith according as is written. I believed and therefore have I spoken. We believe and therefore speak knowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up us also by Jesus and shall present us with you. For all things are for your sakes, that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many redounded to the glory of God. For which cause we faint not. But though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. For our light affliction, our pressing, which is but for a moment, workketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. &gt;&gt; While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal. 1955, Brother Brandham made a statement like this. He said, "I remember when brethren and I were in the mountains real early in the morning around 4:00. We'd rise up, look, hanging back there, and there was the morning star. It gets real dark just before the break of day." When we see the darkness gathering now, what is it? It's light pressing against darkness. One has to give way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All the creeping things that's been running around through the night, when the sun comes up, they take shelter when the light shines. &gt;&gt; Night and dark. Night and light cannot exist in the same building. IT'S EITHER DARK or it's light. And the light is so much more powerful than the darkness. &gt;&gt; SO IS CHRIST SO MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN all the enemies of the world. NOW WE ARE TAUGHT BY SCIENTISTS as the light begins to come, it condenses the darkness and the darkness gathers all of its host together to fight against the light. But the light prevails and comes on. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see the light will always overpower the darkness. &gt;&gt; The darkness, the darkness has no comprehension of light. When light comes, it is pushing all of the darkness away. And that is what these pressings on us are doing. They are pressing the darkness away. You remember he was talking about all the creeping things that run around in the night. We've had some creeping things that have liked darkness rather than light because the deeds were evil. &gt;&gt; Ephesians. But when the light comes, all those creeping things have to take a shelter somewhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; And because that we are the temple of the Holy Ghost and we don't want any of those creeping things left in us, THEY HAVE TO TAKE FLIGHT and go back where they came from BECAUSE LIGHT AND DARKNESS ARE NOT GOING TO EXIST TOGETHER in the same body. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am a child of light &gt;&gt; and I AM DECREED OVER MY OWN LIFE that in me THERE IS NO DARKNESS AT ALL. &gt;&gt; WELL, that's a pretty proud boast there, preacher. It's already done. &gt;&gt; I'M STILL WORKING WITH THE LORD IN ALL THE APPROPRIATIONS. THERE'S STILL A DYING THAT IS TAKING PLACE. THERE'S STILL THE PRESSING TO PRESS OUT ALL OF THE DARKNESS SO THAT ALL THOSE CREEPING THINGS don't have any place to hide. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE HAVE to have the light of the gospel preached to us and it can't be a m cannot be a mixture. WE CANNOT HAVE TRUTH AND FABLES MIXED TOGETHER WHEN WE ARE BEING PREACHED TO BECAUSE WE ARE uh we are longing for the truth of the word to be so clear, so crisp, so light in us that there is not one single crevice &gt;&gt; where that some of these little scurrying things can hide from the all powerful search light of the goodness of God in our lives. lives because WE HAVE BEEN CALLED FOR SOMETHING FRIENDS. &gt;&gt; We're partakers of the afflictions. We're affl we're partakers OF THE PRESSING BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN CALLED AS MESSIAHES. WE have been called as a PERSON FILLED UP WITH Jesus to demonstrate to another generation to those who don't already know or haven't already come through. You see, beauty and perfection and goodness and quality and usability, they don't come with ease, nor do they come instantaneously. Salvation's free. It's already been paid for. But I have to cooperate with the finished work through the ABCs. Accept, believe, and confess. That's my cooperation with salvation. I can confess that I am saved by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and then turn around tomorrow and for whatever reason because of darkness that is prevailing or pushing in against me, my confession can be I'm lost. I've never been saved. I I don't I I don't know if I'm ever going to be good enough for the kingdom of God. And then the next day, the darkness dissipates a little bit and your confession becomes, I'm saved. I believe that Jesus saved me. Now, my Lord doesn't want you to live in that kind of an instability. &gt;&gt; My Lord Jesus paid an ultimate price for you and for me so that I don't have to live in that up and down. He gave me an assurance that I am saved. AND HOW DO I KEEP THAT ASSURANCE? Number one, I accepted that assurance. It has become an insurance policy for me. I believe what the word of GOD SAYS ABOUT THE FINISHED WORK OF CALVARY. AND THAT IS THE CONFESSION THAT I MAKE. Do I always feel like I'm saved? No. There are some days [snorts] that the battle gets pretty hot and heavy and the feeling isn't there. I don't feel like running the aisles. I don't feel like screaming. Hallelujah. I don't feel like lifting my hands. I don't feel like that I'm a child of God. But my confession remains. &gt;&gt; I am born again. &gt;&gt; Now that comes when when we accept the Lord Jesus. That is an instantaneous thing. The fact is it's already done. It was all it was just an instantaneous moment where that I said yes Lord I believe that you died for my sins. You were you were you died. You were buried and you rose again on the third day. Uh that was for my justification my sanctification. That was so that I could carry your spirit. I believe that that came as an instantaneous and even when you received or I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was an instantaneous happening per se. It happened the baptism happened all at once for the most part. On the other hand, we continue to have these rebaptisms because he is continuing his work in us. &gt;&gt; He is he his desire is that he himself would live in us in a fullness to where that we would be fully demonstrated to the people that are around us. Yet he knows according to Jeremiah 17 that the heart is deceitful above all things &gt;&gt; and it's desperately wicked. And who can know it? I THE Lord search the heart. I try the reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings. Then we read in Proverbs 17:3, "The finding pot is for silver, the furnace for gold, but the Lord tries the heart." Very similar in so Proverbs 27:21, "As the finding pot for silver and the furnace for gold, so is a man to his praise." Now, what does that mean? So is a man to his praise. Well, let's see an amplified version of it. As the refining pot for silver and the furnace for gold bring forth all the impurities of the metal, so let a man be in his trial of praise, ridding himself of all that is base or insincere. For a man is judged by what he praises and of what he boasts. Now you think about the things that you put your blessing on, the things that you praise. You think about what you boast about. And God is taking us through a refining process because he wants to bring us forth like pure gold. Peter tells us that the trial of our faith is much more precious than that of gold. Now, gold, 24 karat gold, in my reading, 24 karat gold melts at 1,947° F. I'd say that's pretty hot. those that complain about 95 degrees in the Alabama summer. 1,947 degrees is pretty hot. So, we have the furnace for the gold. And then I I I read where that pure silver melts at 1,763° F and sterling silver melts at 1,640° F. These are all still very hot temperatures. We know that silver is used for fine jewelry, as is gold. People are looking for the purest of these to uh to wear around their neck or on their finger or whatever. Sometimes it seems like a bunch of nonsense to spend that much money and they then go flaunt it out in the world when there's folks that are just looking for something to steal. Yet people do it as they do with diamonds. Diamonds are composed of pure carbon. Now, interestingly, a lead pencil which has relatively little value is pure carbon. And then also coal, which is a bit more expensive than a lead pencil, which is used for heating purposes. It is also pure carbon, but not nearly as valuable as a diamond. A diamond has to go through a process. The value of it is increased by pressure and heat. The lead pencil didn't take very much heat. The coal, chunks of coal took a little more, but they didn't take as much as the diamond. The diamond, in order to become a precious jewel, it had to take tremendous heat and pressure. Sapphires, Sapphires are formed through also intense heat and pressure. I'm bringing these in because they are a part of the new city. And he said, I go away to prepare a mansion. If it were not true, I would have told you so. In my father's house, there are many mansions rooms. And if you still are operating on denominational theology where you think we're all going to go live in our own separate house or mansion when we get to heaven. What would be the use? When it finally hit my thinking, I thought, what are we going to all become a bunch of recluses? We're all going TO HAVE OUR GREAT BIG MANSIONS and we're GOING TO LIVE ALL BY OURSELF IN OUR GREAT BIG MANSION THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A GOLD FRONT DOOR and it's going to have jewels all over it for what? I [screaming] you are the mansion that is being prepared. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE WHAT IS BEING PREPARED. AND HE WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THAT new city, that new Jerusalem coming down from God OUT OF HEAVEN AND HE TALKED ABOUT ALL of those precious jewels THAT WERE A PART OF THAT CITY. [snorts] ALL OF THEM CAME BY INTENSE heat and pressure. The value increases with heat and pressure. Sapphires form through intense heat and pressure. Let's get another one. Jasper. Jasper. Its formation starts with silica rich fluids often derived from geothermal or volcanic activity. What is volcanic activity? It's heat and pressure. And then it flows that that uh silicar fluid then flows into porous rock or sediment and starts forming this jasper stone. All right. So heat and pressure and and I don't want you to I don't want you to leave today discouraged because of the thought of heat and pressure. I don't want us TO BE DISCOURAGED. WHAT I WANT US TO focus on is what he is making out of us. &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT JUST HUMAN FLESH ON THIS EARTH TAKING up space for a certain number of years, then we die and that's the end of it. He is making something of us that far exceeds what we have THOUGHT IN TIME PAST. He is making us into his likeness, into his image, from glory to glory. He's changing me. his likeness and his image &gt;&gt; to perfect in me &gt;&gt; the light of God shown to the world. So because of all this pressing that's happening in me, death is taking place inside of me and it's making way so that Jesus can be seen in me. And when people see Jesus in me, when people see Jesus in you, their faith is ignited. &gt;&gt; Their faith is raised up to another level. That's right. &gt;&gt; There are PEOPLE WHO ARE DISGUSTED WITH modern Christianity. COME ON NOW. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE TIRED OF WHAT THEY SEE BECAUSE ALL IT IS IS GO TO church and then live the rest of the week &gt;&gt; any way they want to live. That's not the bridal company. The bridal company is taking on the word, the living word, moment by moment, day by day, not only on service times, but day by day, every day, taking on the Lord Jesus Christ because there's a life that is being formed in us. Some it has been been being formed longer than others. But it is the life of Jesus Christ that is inside of us allowing for the faith of someone else to be ignited to say I don't have to live the way I've been living. I don't have to live defeated and downhearted all the days of my life. There is something supernatural that is taking place on the inside of a body of believers that is in order for us to have the final harvest in the end time. Someone sees you dying to yourself, dying to your anger, and dying to your bitterness, dying to your envies, dying out to having it your way, dying out and rising to new levels in the Lord Jesus Christ. It's his divine life [snorts] that is coming to the forefront. And although the reining the refining process doesn't feel good, when somebody sees you coming through your refining process, when somebody sees you withstanding pressure, when somebody sees you coming through a pressurized process of your life and coming out victorious, coming out with a smile, coming out with the joy of the Lord. They're going to say, "I believe that I'll let the pressings come to me. I believe that this is what I want because I want Jesus to be alive in me." &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF all of it? TO WHOM GOD WOULD MAKE KNOWN WHAT IS THE RICHEST OF THE GLORY OF THIS MYSTERY among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory what are we filling what is being filled up it is the demonstration the lived life the demonstration o of Messiah the demonstration of Jesus Christ in the end time he is taking those afflictions. You see, we see that Paul was talking about something that had to be filled up in us. Christ already, Jesus Christ already went through it. He already appropriated, but he put us on this earth. the scripture that we use so often. Though he were a son, yet he learned obedience by the things that he suffered, the things that he went through, the pressings that came to him. That's how he learned obedience. And the Lord Jesus put us on this earth in in our in a fallen state be as brother Brandham once put it. He said it was so that we could prove our love to the Lord Jesus Christ. We could demonstrate how much we love him by all of the things that we go through &gt;&gt; in this fallen state. He didn't put us in the earth in a perfected state. He put us here as a fallen human being. We came just as David talked about. I came from my mother's womb as a liar. Nobody had to teach it to me. I came as a I came with a fallen na fallen nature here on this earth and I had to have a bornag again experience uh to get back to God because in me was that fallen nature where I wanted to lie, I wanted to cheat, I wanted to steal, I wanted to have bad habits, I wanted all the worldly pleasures that could be offered in a fallen nature. That's what happens. We can't be upset with people when they're in a fallen state. They don't know any better but to keep sinning &gt;&gt; because that's what sinners do. They sin. But when we're born again of the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, our nature is changing. &gt;&gt; Again, it is not instantaneous. It would be lovely, but it's not. &gt;&gt; IT'S A PROCESS that the Lord is working in us. It comes through heat. It comes through pressure. It comes through refining process that he is working in us. I want you to listen to this from 1954 Jubilee year. Then if in your heart you have received the Lord Jesus, you're at peace with him. Watch back your life. I'll tell you the kind of Christians I like to see when they walk down the street. Say, "Now look, see that fell going there? Now he's a Christian. I don't belong to his church, but brother, he's a Christian. I tell you, I've seen him in the tight places. See that woman there? Yes, sir. Well, she might not look so popular among the women, but she's a Christian. I'll tell you, she's a Christian. LET THE WHOLE CITY say there's a Christian. They'll know it. The Bible said you're sealed. Did you ever put a seal on anything? They take it up like this and put a seal on it. They press it on both sides. They see you coming and see you going. Is that right? You're a Christian through and through. Sealed by the spirit of God. They know what you was. That's right. It's a pressing, a marking, a sealing. That's exactly the truth. Now, that's when you're sealed in the kingdom of God. Now I want you to I want us to remember that there are many baptisms but there is the final ceiling of the bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Many times we have heard brother Brandham talk about the box car and that there was a certain time where that it would be sealed. And we we talk in potential because again as Joshua is saying it's already done. Jesus Christ paid the full price and it is already done. I am living in this life to bring the full appropriation that has been made for my life. &gt;&gt; Not just to say I'm saved. That's not who I am. I am saved, but I'm more than just saved. I am a bloodbought child of God, redeemed by the Lord Jesus Christ. I am saved. I am sanctified. I am filled with the Holy Ghost. I am sealed to the day of my redemption. And the reason I can say all of that is because he gave me a prefixed destiny and I identify with that prefixed destiny. YES. &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE I identify with that predicted destiny, I MAKE IT A PART OF MY CONFESSION. &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD. &gt;&gt; I HAVE ACCEPTED THE WAY, the truth, and the life, the Lord Jesus Christ, AND I AM SAVED. I BELIEVE that he said HE WHOSOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED. BUT [screaming] I BELIEVE MORE than that. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that it is IMPORTANT TO BE BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS Christ for the remission of my sins. I believe that and I acted on it. And because I acted on it, he said in the word that I could be filled because I WAS OBEYING THAT PART OF IT, I COULD BE FILLED with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; I believe it. &gt;&gt; I confess it. I AM TELLING YOU TODAY, I HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. I COULD POINT YOU TO A DAY, but I also want to tell you that I was not complete as far as walking it out at that moment. in God's eyes because he could see down through the the the days that I would be on the earth. In God's eyes, it was already to the completion &gt;&gt; done. [clears throat] But I was put on the earth as you were at a certain day, at a certain time. And he already has a certain day and a certain time that I WILL BE COMPLETE on this earth. And he was able through all of that journeying to give me a prefix destiny and in his eyes say it's done. But I am I am appropriating it. I am carrying it out. I am becoming a participant in my story. There are some things that are already history because I was a participant in my story. But I continue to be a participant in my story because the Lord Jesus has a desire to bring me you to a full place of maturity WHERE THAT AS PAUL WAS TELLING the churches in in the Colossian church and the Corinthian church, he was telling them these afflictions, these pressings are coming because there is something that is taking place inside of you, inside of me. He was saying it about himself. But he as he was saying it about himself, he was trying to get the message across. I am going through all of this so that I can bring comfort and consolation to somebody else that they can see Jesus Christ inside of me. And now Paul has been taken off the scene many years ago. Many people have followed him. Musicians, come please. those those of you that are going to help with the music. Jesus himself wants to live and operate inside of us as it did for Paul. &gt;&gt; He wants to live and operate inside of you so that you can be as Paul was. &gt;&gt; Paul's gone. He has already gone on to the other side. He's a part of the cloud of witnesses. He did his job. He left us some writings and he didn't want us he didn't want us to read this in a surface manner. He wanted us to come to maturity. He wanted Jesus Christ to be seen inside of you. &gt;&gt; Inside of me to demonstrate to somebody else, &gt;&gt; I came through the pressing. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; I came through the afflictions. I came through the tribulation, the afflictions, the the the sufferings. I came through all of the things that were put in my path. It was not because the Lord wanted to kill me. It is because the Lord wanted me to die. &gt;&gt; He wanted ME TO DIE TO SELF. HE WANTED ME TO DIE TO AMBITIONS. HE WANTED ME TO DIE to everything that was unlike the world. He wanted me to die. And so this pressing has come to me. I read one last quote from 1955. Water from the rock. Could you imagine all the waters in the world packed into a stand pipe about this big around? I have no idea what size that was. IT WOULD GO A THOUSAND AND THOUSANDS OF MILES THROUGH the air. And how the pressure of that water coming down, pressing down, trying to find one little crevice to get out. That's the way the love of God and the healing power is trying to pour in this meeting today. Trying its best everywhere. God trying to make his way into a heart with all that pressure of divine love and will and everything trying to press his way into the people. So friends, as we're coming to a close here today, I want you to stand to your feet. I want you to go away with something. And that is the pressing that you're feeling is not because God is trying to squash you like a bug. I want you to go away with a joy in your heart that it is God pressing into you. He is pressing in with his love. And the pressing is in essence pressing out all of those critters that like to hide in the dark. &gt;&gt; The pressing is coming because he wants his divine nature to be in us. He wants his divine nature to be working so much in us until that people don't see brother Gley. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember when Jesus was standing among them and one of the disciples said, "Show us the father." And Jesus says, "Have I been so long with you and you still don't know who I am?" Say, "Preacher, that's a pretty big and bold statement to to throw out there. Well, friends, if I'm to be like him, if I'm to have his nature, his character, I'm to be acting like him, performing. I mean, isn't this what we've been hearing preached? &gt;&gt; Messiah, &gt;&gt; these signs shall follow them that believe. Amen. &gt;&gt; In my name. &gt;&gt; I wear his name. IT'S NOT JUST SO I CAN HAVE A SIGNATURE. &gt;&gt; I wear his name because he wants ME TO BE JUST LIKE HIM. &gt;&gt; So these pressings are to press out all of the things that are unlike him. Bow your heads with me. Father, I thank you that you are good and merciful and kind. I thank you, Lord, that you have such a love for us that we can come today and in everything we can give thanks because you're working in us such a beautiful, beautiful thing, your very own life. I thank you, Father, for all that you have allowed me to go through along with these your people. I want to thank you that I'm seeing more of Jesus in your people. And I'm trusting they're seeing more of you in me, God. It is because we want you to get the glory. We're not trying to boast of ourselves. We're not trying to receive praise for ourselves. We only long, Lord, that you get praise and honor and glory. Let these words now be sealed in by the power of the Holy Spirit in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Of times the day seems long, [singing] our trials hard to bear. We're tempted to complain, to murmur and despair. But Christ will soon appear to catch his bride away. All tears forever over. In God's eternal day, it will be worth it all. [singing] When we see Jesus, life trials will seem so small when we see Christ. One glimpse of his dear face. All sorrows will erase [music] so bravely run the race till we see Christ. I want us to sing this chorus again and I want us not to put it so much in a future day when we get into that glorious land just beyond this veil. But I believe that we in our lifetime will recognize I am recognizing I don't know about you but I am recognizing now that these trials this pressure is worth it. I'm recognizing that these trials are seeming smaller and smaller because I'm getting a glimpse. I'm getting a glimpse in you. I'm even getting a glimpse in me. Seeing Jesus, the nature, the character of Jesus. PREACHER, AREN'T YOU GOING a little too far? Pressing this thing a little too far. saying about little Jesus is, "Oh no, friend. &gt;&gt; I THINK THAT WE HAVE HELD the reigns for way too long. &gt;&gt; I think that we have held back way too LONG IN DESCRIBING WHAT THE BRIDAL COMPANY IS going to look like in the end time. I think we have made it much too small. WE HAVE HELD BACK AFRAID OF WHAT PEOPLE WOULD SAY ABOUT US AND ABOUT OUR DOCTRINE AND ABOUT OUR THEOLOGY. BUT FRIENDS, I am seeing more and more that the LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST IN THE BRIDAL COMPANY IN the end time is the only way that we're going to make an exit out of here. The only way THAT THE BRIDE IS GOING TO TAKE A RAPTURE is that she is going to have to take on the nature, the character of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He told us that we DIDN'T EVEN HAVE FAITH HARDLY FOR a headache. &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT TO HAVE MY FAITH INCREASED. AND HOW IS MY FAITH GOING TO INCREASE? I'M SEEING PEOPLE THAT ARE CLIMBING MOUNT ZION AND THEY'RE TAKING on more of THE LORD JESUS CHRIST AND IT'S PUTTING SOMETHING IN MY FAITH. IF HE CAN DO IT, IF SHE CAN DO IT, I CAN DO IT. &gt;&gt; I feel the the uncction OF THE HOLY GHOST ON the inside saying, "If they can make it that far, &gt;&gt; I can. &gt;&gt; So I don't have to put this all in a future day." &gt;&gt; That's right. He's making it worth it right now. &gt;&gt; He's letting us see himself. Sing this chorus with me once again. It will be worth it all when we see Jesus. [snorts] Life's [music] trials will seem so small when we see Christ. One glimpse of his dear face all sorrow will erase. So bravely run the race till we see Christ one more time. It will be worth it all. Do you have something? When we see Jesus, life's trials will seem so small. [singing] When we see Christ, one glimpse of his dear face all sorrow will erase.

I am asking God that you would let the blessing of our Lord be upon them. The very life of Jesus may be seen in them. We will not manufacture it, Lord. We will let the light dispel the darkness. Every crevice, every place made bare so that there are no creeping things left. Only Jesus will be seen in us.

In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. You're dismissed to go as you wish to today. I want to thank you for being here in the house of the Lord with us. We'll have service again here on Tuesday night at 7 o'clock. I feel his presence close by and I'm thankful for it. Oneful, wonderful Jesus. [singing] He is my friend, true to [singing] the end.
