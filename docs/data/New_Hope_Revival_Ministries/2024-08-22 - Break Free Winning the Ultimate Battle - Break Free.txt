Description:
This powerful message from Pastor Steven L. Shelley dives into the spiritual battlefield of the mind, emphasizing that the greatest battle ever fought is one that must be won within. He challenges believers to align their thoughts with Christ, resist the enemy's accusations, and hold fast to the life of God. Victory in this battle is essential for overcoming the pressures of this age and stepping into the fullness of God's promise. Through the power of the blood, the Word, and the name of Jesus Christ, the enemy is already defeated, and believers are empowered to outlive and overcome him.
