[0:00] it's a necessity for real Christians to
[0:03] forget their
[0:05] feelings it's not that we don't have
[0:08] feelings but as real Believers it is
[0:11] necessary that we lay our feelings aside
[0:14] and we take God at his word we have to
[0:18] do that in crisis we have to do that in
[0:21] good times we have to do that in
[0:23] mediocre times and we particularly have
[0:26] to do it in difficult times because life
[0:29] is a Str brain and it's stressful fear
[0:32] is the enemy of faith and it's easy for
[0:36] all of us to walk in fear but as true
[0:38] believers we have to put fear aside
[0:41] sometimes we have to drive it out
[0:43] sometimes we have to talk to it and tell
[0:45] it to go so that faith can come and take
[0:49] its place because you're given a Measure
[0:52] of Faith it's never that you don't have
[0:54] enough Faith as a Believer God is either
[0:57] Sovereign or he is not sovereign
[1:01] Sovereign and if we walk away from any
[1:04] situation and say if if there would have
[1:06] been another doctor if there would have
[1:08] been another medicine if there would
[1:10] have been another procedure if we walk
[1:12] away with that kind of a declaration
[1:15] we're not moving in faith we're moving
[1:17] in feelings because if God is Sovereign
[1:21] the right man will show up at the right
[1:23] time to do whatever needs to be done and
[1:27] we're not looking to man anyway we're
[1:29] looking to to God God is leading the
[1:33] believer sometimes we don't even know
[1:35] we're being led we just feel a tug or a
[1:38] pull or an urge and it is the spirit of
[1:41] the Lord within us directing us and
[1:45] leading us whether we're aware of it or
[1:47] not I believe the more aware we become
[1:51] of the leadership of the spirit in our
[1:53] life the more successful we'll be as
[1:56] Christians in the last days I want you
[1:59] to know there's a peace that Jesus has
[2:02] that's not just the absence of turmoil
[2:05] come on now it's not just the absence of
[2:07] a problem but he said the peace that I
[2:09] give to you how many of you know that he
[2:12] taught us that it abides forever it
[2:15] seems to pass all human understanding
[2:19] and it never leaves us if you've ever
[2:22] experienced that peace when you needed
[2:24] him let me see your hand is a testimony
[2:26] he comes and in that moment that you
[2:29] found it hard to come to peace it's
[2:32] because you are letting your feelings
[2:33] Rule and in that moment no one can do it
[2:37] for you brother no one can control your
[2:39] feelings and emotions but you it is our
[2:42] responsibility to take a hold of those
[2:44] things when we recognize them pulling us
[2:47] away from the word when we feel those
[2:49] things pulling us away from Faith it's
[2:51] our responsibility to take them captive
[2:54] to arrest them to submit them ain't that
[2:57] what he said casting down all all
[3:00] imagination and taking captive every
[3:03] thought that's contrary to truth did you
[3:07] know yielding to that stuff one time can
[3:10] pull you right out of the will of God it
[3:13] can place a bitterness within you and
[3:15] that bitterness you know it seems like
[3:17] it it normally takes years and years for
[3:20] bitterness to grow but we're living in
[3:22] such an accelerated hour that by
[3:26] entertaining those negative thoughts we
[3:28] can find nearly over night that a
[3:30] bitterness has taken
[3:32] hold and what's wrong with bitterness is
[3:35] we start seeing everything around us
[3:38] from the filter of bitterness amen and
[3:41] we get
[3:42] madder and matter and matter and matter
[3:45] we get more jealous and more jealous and
[3:47] more jealous and the next thing you know
[3:49] we start cutting ourselves off from the
[3:52] people who love us the
[3:54] most we start cutting ourselves off from
[3:58] the church that is there to help us from
[4:01] our leaders that are there to help us so
[4:03] we isolate ourselves into a
[4:06] depression where if we could recognize
[4:08] who we are and what Authority we have
[4:11] over our own life I can't take jealousy
[4:13] out of your life but I can deal with it
[4:16] in mine
