Description:
God is calling many of us to a higher place of consecration in this supernatural year we’re living in.  We’ve gone as far with God as we’re going to go, until we’re willing to pay a greater price He wants to become involved in every detail of our lives.  We’re serving a sovereign-minded God who has a plan that far exceeds that which we could even ask or think.
