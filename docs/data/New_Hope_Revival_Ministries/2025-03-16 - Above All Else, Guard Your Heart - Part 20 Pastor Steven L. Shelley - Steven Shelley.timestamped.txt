[1:00:34] about a
[1:00:37] storm I want to see you posting all day
[1:00:40] long today that he is on the
[1:00:45] throne amen and if you didn't get a
[1:00:48] chance to see brother that little clip
[1:00:51] of the of the uh movement on radar that
[1:00:55] brother Dan Daniel posted today take a
[1:00:58] look at it it'll show you what God was
[1:01:00] doing he had his hand on this area and
[1:01:04] the storm just moved North you watch
[1:01:06] every bit of it come from way south of
[1:01:08] here and just move just like that while
[1:01:11] we're just held here and the the image
[1:01:13] of it is really uh noticeable it's very
[1:01:17] noticeable there was nothing moving in
[1:01:20] that area and and those storms were just
[1:01:23] God is so good it hat build at our house
[1:01:27] for about somewhere between 3 to 5
[1:01:29] seconds and some of the hailstones were
[1:01:32] the biggest I've seen in a long long
[1:01:34] time but they weren't all that big
[1:01:37] that's what I noticed there were many
[1:01:39] many small ones and a few larger ones in
[1:01:43] the in the bunch and I saw them laying
[1:01:46] that the wind was blowing them and they
[1:01:47] were laying on the window seal and uh
[1:01:50] lot of lightning and thunder and you
[1:01:53] heard you saw the wind all day yesterday
[1:01:55] and and and it picked up but and and
[1:01:58] many in other places certainly lost they
[1:02:01] lost lives they lost possessions and I
[1:02:04] don't want you to think that we think
[1:02:06] that we're any more loved or any more
[1:02:08] favored than any of those people but God
[1:02:10] is good and he promised he promised he
[1:02:15] promised that he would watch over us and
[1:02:17] the reality is just simply this if you
[1:02:21] are ready to meet the
[1:02:23] Lord and you know you're
[1:02:26] ready then it doesn't matter whether you
[1:02:29] hide under the bed or get in the closet
[1:02:31] or or uh I mean I was a little surprised
[1:02:35] that they were instructing and
[1:02:37] encouraging people to put on football
[1:02:40] helmets this I've never I've never
[1:02:42] really heard this before and I knew that
[1:02:45] if I was going to have my family in
[1:02:47] Israel during inata and we weren't going
[1:02:51] to wear gas masks as they asked us to do
[1:02:55] I knew we weren't going to go looking
[1:02:56] for football helmets because God is a
[1:03:00] great big God now that doesn't mean that
[1:03:03] we shouldn't use wisdom you know here's
[1:03:06] our wisdom we get a candle out and put
[1:03:08] it on the table in case we need it and I
[1:03:10] charge my
[1:03:12] flashl that's
[1:03:13] wisdom amen and uh we ask the kids if
[1:03:17] they want to come down and stay with us
[1:03:20] because they're in the mobile home
[1:03:22] that's right up on top of the hill it's
[1:03:23] in a high place and they weren't sure if
[1:03:26] they would but they ended up doing that
[1:03:28] and the other wisdom is we pushed the
[1:03:30] air mattress far away from the window as
[1:03:33] we could get it went to bed and slept
[1:03:36] until I had to go to the bathroom and
[1:03:39] that's when I realized it was storming
[1:03:41] the storm didn't wake me up I realized
[1:03:43] when I woke up and uh looked out and saw
[1:03:47] all that and went back and I started
[1:03:49] humming to myself the the the old uh
[1:03:53] Betty Jean Robinson song I can sleep
[1:03:55] like a baby I've got peace in my soul
[1:03:59] because God has got everything under
[1:04:03] control amen now I know some people
[1:04:06] don't believe that but he does and I
[1:04:09] want you to know that if that storm was
[1:04:11] meant for you to take your life if if
[1:04:14] you have come to the end of your days it
[1:04:16] would find
[1:04:19] you it would find you I'm not trying to
[1:04:21] be crazy I'm trying to say we believe a
[1:04:24] certain truth that's called
[1:04:27] sovereignty and that means that God is
[1:04:29] Sovereign and if in his predetermined
[1:04:31] plan he thought well I want her home and
[1:04:34] I'm going to just use the the storm is a
[1:04:37] br I'll just use that to bring her home
[1:04:39] he would find you in the basement in the
[1:04:41] closet uh with your helmet
[1:04:45] on my mama used to get under the couch
[1:04:48] and turn the couch over on top of her
[1:04:51] well first of all I'm too a little bit
[1:04:53] claustrophobic I couldn't live I
[1:04:55] couldn't live under to the couch she
[1:04:57] turned the couch over on top of her and
[1:04:59] got down under it and put mattresses in
[1:05:01] the tub when I was little sat us sat me
[1:05:04] in the tub with mattresses all around I
[1:05:07] learned the the drills in school how
[1:05:10] many of you remember the uh tornado
[1:05:12] drills in school what did they have you
[1:05:14] to do we'd go out into the hallway we'd
[1:05:17] sit with our backs up against the all
[1:05:20] the glass all the glass above the doors
[1:05:23] but we were just right there we all sat
[1:05:26] along the way bent our heads
[1:05:29] over and used our bare hands to protect
[1:05:33] us and we sat there like that does
[1:05:35] anybody think that was much protection I
[1:05:38] don't think it was but that was all we
[1:05:40] knew to do that's what they told us to
[1:05:42] do this what we did and they made us
[1:05:44] practice it in sunny
[1:05:46] weather so we could get it right I
[1:05:49] realize then even as a child I realized
[1:05:51] something's a little bit wrong
[1:05:53] somebody's trying to cover themselves
[1:05:56] somebody's trying to keep from being
[1:05:57] sued because this is not much protection
[1:06:01] brother those angels that were called in

[1:08:51] over this property he promised us that
[1:08:54] he would protect and he had
[1:08:56] that doesn't mean that Satan can't
[1:08:57] trespass he can trespass especially if
[1:09:00] we let down our guard but he told me one

[1:10:45] pastor here and we always called her

[1:18:26] [Applause]
[1:18:29] today amen we ought to do good on
[1:18:32] Sunday we can look nice on Sunday can't
[1:18:35] we we should we're coming to the Lord's
[1:18:39] House amen we're a little more casual on
[1:18:42] Tuesday night because people are coming
[1:18:44] from work including me I I just sometime
[1:18:48] get home in time to grab something and
[1:18:50] get back and there no harm in that I
[1:18:52] know some of you think that we should
[1:18:54] wear three pece suits on Tuesday but I
[1:18:56] don't see you doing
[1:18:58] it but I like to be a little more
[1:19:00] relaxed on Tuesday night but on Sunday
[1:19:02] we ought to do a little better because
[1:19:04] we're coming here to honor the King of
[1:19:07] Kings and the Lord of lords you know
[1:19:10] somebody said to me well they said you
[1:19:13] know I I just have to let my children
[1:19:14] run around a little bit
[1:19:16] because we we let them run around at
[1:19:18] home and we we can't confuse them by
[1:19:21] telling them they can't run around at
[1:19:23] church you know I don't I don't buy into
[1:19:25] that philosophy at all you you better
[1:19:28] teach them that there's a place to run
[1:19:30] and play and have fun and a place that's
[1:19:33] sacred if you don't teach them when
[1:19:36] they're little if you don't teach them
[1:19:38] that when they're little they will never
[1:19:39] get that when they're older it's all
[1:19:42] right it's all right in their little
[1:19:43] lives for them to have places where they
[1:19:45] know they're safe and they can just
[1:19:47] enjoy theirself but when they come to
[1:19:49] God's house it's all right to start
[1:19:52] working with them and teaching them that
[1:19:55] this is a place where the only running
[1:19:57] around we do is when we're praising him
[1:20:00] amen you can be loud at home and just
[1:20:03] have your fun at Nanas and paps and uh
[1:20:07] grandies and whatever pops and I don't
[1:20:09] know what all you all use but you can
[1:20:12] but when you come to God's house you got
[1:20:13] to learn a little bit and it's not easy
[1:20:15] it's a process to teach them isn't it
[1:20:17] but you'll be blessed if you do it
[1:20:20] you'll be blessed if you hear what
[1:20:21] brother gy said today and teach them
[1:20:23] that that the tithe do do belong to
[1:20:25] them when they're little like that and
[1:20:28] they bring their little quarter up here
[1:20:29] and put it in envelope and they want
[1:20:31] credit for it there's nothing wrong with
[1:20:33] that it teaches them that there's a
[1:20:35] portion of the blessing of God that he
[1:20:37] gives to them that belongs to him and if
[1:20:40] you'll be faithful to do that through
[1:20:41] your life you will enjoy a blessing
[1:20:44] that's promised to those who are
[1:20:45] faithful in those areas let's turn to
[1:20:48] Isaiah chapter 3 this morning and um we
[1:20:53] will uh I was going to try to read
[1:20:56] another scripture to try to bridge the
[1:21:00] way into this one but um I just didn't
[1:21:03] do it so we'll just how many of you
[1:21:06] think we ought to just hit it hot and
[1:21:07] heavy from the
[1:21:09] start Isaiah chapter 3 beginning in
[1:21:12] verse 16 remember this is a prophecy
[1:21:16] from the from the prophet Isaiah and he
[1:21:18] is prophesying to the to the house of
[1:21:20] Israel to the children of the Lord and
[1:21:23] he said moreover the Lord saith because
[1:21:28] the daughters of Zion are hauy we've
[1:21:32] been working on offense and we have been
[1:21:36] working on how Pride partners with
[1:21:39] offense and pride can manifest itself as
[1:21:44] haughtiness and as arrogance it can
[1:21:47] manifest itself as someone who thinks
[1:21:50] that they are uh Superior in some way to
[1:21:54] others morally Superior or they have a
[1:21:57] better education or they or they come
[1:22:00] from a from a uh you know a higher place
[1:22:03] in
[1:22:04] society and uh you know that's nothing
[1:22:07] that that that's just fodder it means
[1:22:09] nothing whatsoever your pedigrees and
[1:22:13] your categories and your cast system it
[1:22:17] means nothing to the Lord he the ground
[1:22:20] is level at the foot of the cross but
[1:22:24] when God God's people get arrogant when
[1:22:26] God's people uh lean on pride pride
[1:22:31] partners with offense and offense leads
[1:22:34] to deception and so there's something
[1:22:37] that we've got to watch in our lives
[1:22:39] those Spirits when they start coming
[1:22:41] together to strengthen one another and
[1:22:43] the prophet Isaiah said you know the the
[1:22:46] people of Israel the children of Israel
[1:22:48] were dead desert dwellers a and they
[1:22:50] were plain people and although they
[1:22:53] brought some SP oil out of Egypt they
[1:22:56] were they were plain living people and
[1:22:58] when they when they lived plain when
[1:23:00] they lived simple before the Lord they
[1:23:03] enjoyed the benefits of the favor of the
[1:23:05] Lord but then they started getting proud
[1:23:08] and long about that middle part of the
[1:23:11] Old Testament when the prophets Isaiah
[1:23:13] and Jeremiah Ezekiel and others began to
[1:23:15] cry out warning the people of Israel
[1:23:18] they begin to get a little proud they
[1:23:20] begin to get a little huy and
[1:23:23] particularly in this portion of
[1:23:25] scripture the women are the ones who are
[1:23:28] getting a little a little little high
[1:23:30] and lifted up and he said because the
[1:23:33] daughters of Zion are hoty and they walk
[1:23:39] with stretched forth
[1:23:42] necks you know In some cultures it's
[1:23:45] important to have a stretched neck in
[1:23:47] certain African cultures they put gold
[1:23:50] bands around their neck and they keep
[1:23:52] adding to them and adding to them lit Al
[1:23:54] physically stretching their neck so they
[1:23:58] begin to look like
[1:23:59] giraffes instead of people you know that
[1:24:02] don't you because in their culture the
[1:24:05] the longer your
[1:24:07] neck the the the you know more Prestige
[1:24:10] you have and this must have been already
[1:24:13] kind of going on the thought of of this
[1:24:15] stretching of the neck was already going
[1:24:18] on in the days of Isaiah's prophecy
[1:24:21] because they're walking around with
[1:24:22] their head in the air and want and
[1:24:26] eyes now if you don't know what want and
[1:24:28] eyes are let's call them bedroom
[1:24:31] eyes and those bedroom eyes are eyes
[1:24:36] that you have for your
[1:24:39] husband you don't have a husband then
[1:24:41] you don't need Bedroom
[1:24:43] Eyes uh don't look at me with them I'll
[1:24:46] tell you that right now and don't look
[1:24:48] at anybody else except the man you love
[1:24:52] with those eyes because uh uh women have
[1:24:56] learned through throughout the time that
[1:24:59] those little eyes can say so much if you
[1:25:03] know what I mean this is God's people
[1:25:06] and they're walking around with
[1:25:07] stretched necks and bedroom eyes and and
[1:25:11] they're walking and
[1:25:13] mincing as they
[1:25:15] go now when we think of mincing we think
[1:25:18] of
[1:25:19] chopping we're we're going to have some
[1:25:22] minced meat we're going to have some
[1:25:23] chopped something chopped sooi things
[1:25:27] cut up in little pieces well in order to
[1:25:29] do that there has to be some some
[1:25:32] agitation you understand to make things
[1:25:35] minced so these women are sort of using
[1:25:39] their body
[1:25:41] twisting as they go do you know what I
[1:25:44] mean this was God's people stretch necks
[1:25:47] bedroom eyes and now they're throwing
[1:25:50] their hips back and forth and you don't
[1:25:53] have to have on high heel
[1:25:55] shoes which are not
[1:25:58] godly but you don't have to have those
[1:26:00] on to have a little hip action and don't
[1:26:03] ever tell me that that a woman doesn't
[1:26:06] know when she's swaying like that
[1:26:08] because she certainly does know it and
[1:26:11] there's no reason to do it and if you
[1:26:13] see a man doing it you better really
[1:26:15] pray for
[1:26:16] him are you still here yes and they're
[1:26:19] making a tinkling with their feet now I
[1:26:23] don't know but my feet don't make a
[1:26:24] tinkling sound when I walk I don't have
[1:26:28] anklets on and I don't have toes tow
[1:26:31] rings on and I don't have things hanging
[1:26:35] on my ankles like the world wants and
[1:26:38] here was God's people picking up some of
[1:26:42] this uh uh
[1:26:44] Pride red toenails you know and uh tow
[1:26:49] rings and anklets and all this kind of
[1:26:52] stuff and they were so uh done up that
[1:26:55] when they walk they begin to make a
[1:26:57] sound you knew at least you knew they
[1:26:59] were coming
[1:27:00] right he's prophesying he's not
[1:27:05] criticizing he's
[1:27:07] prophesying therefore the Lord will
[1:27:10] Smite with a scab the crown of the head
[1:27:16] of the daughters of Zion and the Lord
[1:27:19] will discover their secret Parts it
[1:27:21] means the Lord will lay them be the Lord
[1:27:25] will expose their nakedness now he's not
[1:27:28] just particularly speaking about the
[1:27:30] anatomy he's speaking about the secret
[1:27:33] desires of their heart to be like the
[1:27:36] women of the
[1:27:38] world their motive is going to be
[1:27:41] exposed and there's going to be nothing
[1:27:44] hidden from the lord they're going to be
[1:27:46] bare before the Lord he said in that day
[1:27:49] the Lord will take away The Bravery of
[1:27:52] their tinkling arm
[1:27:54] ornaments about their feet and their
[1:27:57] calls and their round tires like the
[1:28:02] moon uh all of these round things you
[1:28:06] just just follow it I'm not breaking
[1:28:08] down every word I will do that for you
[1:28:11] at some point because we haven't done it
[1:28:13] in a long time but you're just thinking
[1:28:15] of round things all of these things
[1:28:19] hanging on women uh round tires like the
[1:28:24] moon their calls the chains and the
[1:28:30] bracelets it's mentioned right in the
[1:28:33] word it's right there in the
[1:28:36] scripture I don't believe the Lord is
[1:28:38] talking about your rubber band your
[1:28:41] rubber uh memory bracelet or whatever
[1:28:44] they call I don't think the Lord is
[1:28:46] particularly talking about your
[1:28:48] thread or your
[1:28:50] crochet but I think if we start leaning
[1:28:53] toward the gold and the
[1:28:59] silver we're getting more and more just
[1:29:01] like the world around us and the reality
[1:29:05] is it doesn't make you more
[1:29:07] beautiful your beauty is not in how much
[1:29:10] you tinkle when you
[1:29:11] walk this is going to be a little hard
[1:29:13] for my children because of the way I use
[1:29:15] the word
[1:29:18] tinkle but I'm not using this for the
[1:29:22] bathroom I'm using this for the s that
[1:29:24] people make sometime when they move
[1:29:27] around are you following me somebody
[1:29:30] said oh oh this is really going to be a
[1:29:31] sermon chains and bracelets and mufflers
[1:29:35] and and bonnets and ornaments of the
[1:29:40] legs and headbands this is jewels and
[1:29:44] the tablets and the
[1:29:47] earrings you know they're stirrups for
[1:29:49] the
[1:29:52] devil rings and nose
[1:29:56] Jewels now these things are specifically
[1:30:00] mentioned but now he gets a little more
[1:30:02] General and he says the changeable suits
[1:30:04] of apparel and The Mantel and the
[1:30:06] wimples and the crisping
[1:30:09] pins that's curlers and irons and all of
[1:30:14] these things that people get so carried
[1:30:16] away permanent chemicals to permanently
[1:30:21] twist up their hair and make them look
[1:30:23] like poodles and instead of
[1:30:25] Believers anybody with
[1:30:27] me now glasses and remember that this
[1:30:32] there there were no prescription glasses
[1:30:34] this is talking about ornamental this is
[1:30:36] talking about decorative this is talking
[1:30:39] about uh Fine Things fine linen hoods
[1:30:43] and the
[1:30:45] veils and it shall come to
[1:30:49] pass ver uh did I miss something here no
[1:30:53] verse 24 it shall come to pass that
[1:30:56] instead of sweet smell there shall be
[1:30:59] stink and instead of spanks uh excuse me
[1:31:03] instead of a girdle a
[1:31:05] rent and instead of well set hair
[1:31:10] baldness and instead of a
[1:31:13] stomacher a giring of
[1:31:17] sackcloth so no one is going to be
[1:31:19] cinching them in that's what it's
[1:31:22] talking about and burning instead of
[1:31:27] beauty thy men shall fall by the sword
[1:31:31] now the men are losing
[1:31:37] out they're losing out because they're
[1:31:41] following their eyes can't stay off of
[1:31:45] these Daughters of Zion and it's not
[1:31:49] just eyes their heart is following lust
[1:31:52] is coming in and they're going to fall
[1:31:55] By The Sword and thy Mighty in the war
[1:31:57] and her gate shall lament and mourn and
[1:32:00] she being desolate shall sit upon the
[1:32:04] ground now that's pretty serious words
[1:32:07] God help us today as we approach your
[1:32:11] word we we ask for your anointing to
[1:32:14] help deliver and to help receive that
[1:32:17] which you would say to us we're not here
[1:32:20] to end somebody's life we're not here to
[1:32:24] uh condemn anybody we're just here to
[1:32:28] say that there is a
[1:32:30] progression and and we better find our
[1:32:34] place to stop we better not keep
[1:32:38] following the trend else we wind up in
[1:32:42] the condition that the daughters of Zion
[1:32:45] ended in where there is no stop and
[1:32:48] where they began to look like the
[1:32:50] Gypsies and the nomads of of the of the
[1:32:54] land those who who traveled around with
[1:32:58] all of their jewels on at one time and
[1:33:00] all of their layers of clothing at one
[1:33:03] time to present themselves uh as having
[1:33:07] Prestige may we understand that the
[1:33:10] beauty of a Believer is from the
[1:33:13] inside it's not in
[1:33:15] fanciness it's in humility that you're
[1:33:18] going to bless us in this hour I'm going
[1:33:21] to need your help Lord because some will
[1:33:23] sit down on me and I'm going to need
[1:33:26] your help I'm depending on you now in
[1:33:28] the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:33:30] we pray and the Saints said amen amen
[1:33:34] you may be seated now we know that God
[1:33:37] is not specifically in this Prophecy
[1:33:40] from Isaiah condemning any of these
[1:33:45] particular things we're we're not seeing
[1:33:48] anything in there that says that these
[1:33:52] particular things
[1:33:55] individually pose a
[1:33:57] problem but what we hear the prophet
[1:34:00] saying is these are things that the
[1:34:05] women of Zion are picking up from the
[1:34:09] Heathen they're picking them up from
[1:34:12] Godless societies and Godless tribes and
[1:34:17] those who don't know Jehovah the God of
[1:34:21] Israel and there seems to be a an
[1:34:24] increasing desire among them to make
[1:34:28] more beautiful the outside while the
[1:34:32] inside is plotting and planning against
[1:34:37] the
[1:34:38] men come on now I want you to hear what
[1:34:41] I just said so if any of these things
[1:34:45] have been your habit I don't want you to
[1:34:48] look at that as though that any of these
[1:34:50] things individually have been identif
[1:34:53] ified as something that we should not
[1:34:57] participate in but yet there are many
[1:34:59] things there that we understand by the
[1:35:02] word of the Lord that Believers should
[1:35:05] not be involved in but Isaiah is
[1:35:08] specifically saying it's it's so much
[1:35:12] that there's no stopping place it it
[1:35:15] just goes on and on and on brother
[1:35:19] brandham knew this was going to be a
[1:35:20] problem because he contrasted the
[1:35:23] difference he said you know if a if a
[1:35:26] husband wants to give his wife a little
[1:35:28] chain or something and she wants to wear
[1:35:30] that in respect for husband he said well
[1:35:33] that'd be all right and but then he
[1:35:35] talks about women Pentecostal women
[1:35:39] looking like they have gone through the
[1:35:41] dime store
[1:35:45] magnetized because they're just taking
[1:35:47] everything all kinds of
[1:35:50] bedazzles and shiny shiny shinies
[1:35:54] hello and and putting them on to hide
[1:35:58] who they really are we we hide behind
[1:36:02] things some people hide behind
[1:36:05] instruments in church some people hide
[1:36:08] behind their
[1:36:10] babies some people hide behind their
[1:36:13] husbands a and and sometimes women
[1:36:17] according to Isaiah will put things on
[1:36:20] and then kind of hide behind it because
[1:36:22] there's something lacking and something
[1:36:25] missing on the
[1:36:26] inside brother brandom tells us that a
[1:36:29] woman is born with a desire and then a
[1:36:32] desire to to be beautiful and and if
[1:36:35] you're against that you're just
[1:36:42] ugly I for
[1:36:44] one am not against my wife being
[1:36:50] beautiful I'm for that that's not the
[1:36:53] reason I chose her but it
[1:36:57] certainly took my breath
[1:37:00] away do you understand it's not wrong
[1:37:03] that a woman wants to
[1:37:05] match if brother Brandon wanted to wear
[1:37:08] sear sucker with something that didn't
[1:37:10] match and plaid and what whatever he
[1:37:12] wanted to do that was all right for him
[1:37:13] to do it but I want you to know Sister
[1:37:15] ma didn't look like
[1:37:17] that she tried to match and her purse
[1:37:20] matched her shoes and she tried to to to
[1:37:23] be beautiful because she was
[1:37:25] representing
[1:37:27] him you see the daughters of Zion forgot
[1:37:30] who they were
[1:37:31] representing they weren't just
[1:37:33] representing their Soldier husbands but
[1:37:36] they were representing the god of Israel
[1:37:39] The God Who dwelt in Zion anybody with
[1:37:42] me and so they were not just reflecting
[1:37:46] on their families or their parents or
[1:37:49] where they came from but they were
[1:37:51] actually reflecting on the god of
[1:37:54] History the god of Israel the God who
[1:37:57] brought his children out of Egypt The
[1:37:59] God Who fed him with Mana who fed him
[1:38:02] with Quail The God Who allowed water to
[1:38:05] come out of a rock when they were
[1:38:06] thirsty and when the water was bitter he
[1:38:09] made a way for the water to be sweet and
[1:38:11] when the ocean kept them back he opened
[1:38:14] up the sea and made a way for them to
[1:38:17] pass through how many of you are with me
[1:38:20] that's a God who loved his people yes
[1:38:24] a God who was faithful to them and a God
[1:38:28] who wanted a people who would walk
[1:38:30] before him in humility in meekness in
[1:38:34] humbleness of heart both genders men who
[1:38:38] would not be so proud of their military
[1:38:42] might that they didn't give God credit
[1:38:44] for his strength and courage women who
[1:38:47] wouldn't be so proud of their beauty
[1:38:50] that they would pick up the ways of
[1:38:52] Egypt and the ways of the amalekites and
[1:38:55] the ways of the Canaanites because he
[1:38:58] wanted a separated people if God said I
[1:39:02] don't want your peas and your corn to
[1:39:04] grow in the same row he wanted even
[1:39:07] their Farm to be identified as belonging
[1:39:11] to a child of the king of kings Jehovah
[1:39:15] God are you with me and so if he cared
[1:39:19] about that so much that he even told
[1:39:22] them under that ceremonial law that your
[1:39:26] clothes could not be made of mixed fiber
[1:39:29] and there were all kinds of added
[1:39:31] Securities placed on how they would
[1:39:34] dress and how they would live how they
[1:39:36] would worship how they would bring
[1:39:38] offerings unto the Lord it was a very
[1:39:42] organized and a very meticulous plan
[1:39:45] that God had created for his people how
[1:39:48] it must have grieved his
[1:39:51] heart when he saw saw them beginning to
[1:39:55] put on the bracelets and put on the
[1:39:57] anklets and put on the all of the
[1:40:00] different things the twistings of the
[1:40:02] hair and and the ways that they would
[1:40:04] try to make them it's not that God
[1:40:06] wanted his women to be ugly it's not
[1:40:10] that God cared if the Israelite women uh
[1:40:13] were beautiful he he made them beautiful
[1:40:17] he just didn't want them taking on the
[1:40:20] appearance of the women of of
[1:40:24] heathenism the women of paganism the way
[1:40:29] the women of false religion he said they
[1:40:32] can be beautiful but they don't have to
[1:40:34] put on and Trust in changing of garments
[1:40:37] and and all of these mirrors and all the
[1:40:41] time do you know that even in Victorian
[1:40:44] days women use mirrors as part of their
[1:40:47] outfit and they used fans as part of of
[1:40:51] their outfit and they would walk walk
[1:40:53] around looking at themselves this is a
[1:40:56] spirit of Pride and God said I'm going
[1:40:58] to have a people and they're not going
[1:41:01] to be necessarily homely they're going
[1:41:03] to be a beautiful people I'm going to
[1:41:06] beautify them with salvation they're
[1:41:08] going to walk differently they're going
[1:41:10] to talk differently they're going to
[1:41:13] dress differently they're going to
[1:41:15] definitely differentiate between the
[1:41:18] genders but I don't want them picking up
[1:41:21] too many of the
[1:41:24] habits of the other
[1:41:27] nations because if they do there's no
[1:41:30] stopping
[1:41:32] place are you with me all we have to do
[1:41:36] folks is I'm not going to be on this the
[1:41:39] whole time you can
[1:41:43] relax all we have to do is look at
[1:41:50] Pentecost there's even memes
[1:41:54] on social
[1:41:56] media that compares the dedication of a
[1:42:01] woman a Christian Pentecostal woman that
[1:42:05] compares her dedication to the Lord to
[1:42:08] the length of her skirt have any of you
[1:42:10] seen
[1:42:12] it and it even makes this statement that
[1:42:16] the one who wears the longer skirt is
[1:42:18] going to be the Wednesday night
[1:42:19] Christian
[1:42:25] I'm not saying I espouse that
[1:42:27] Doctrine but I'm just saying here is a
[1:42:30] this is their opinion this is the way
[1:42:32] they put it together they're saying here
[1:42:34] is a woman who's going to be
[1:42:36] faithful and here is a woman that's not
[1:42:39] going to take
[1:42:40] chances and here's a woman that's not
[1:42:42] going to live on the
[1:42:45] edges here's a woman that's going to go
[1:42:48] all the way I'm not espousing or saying
[1:42:52] that a woman has to cover her ankles I'm
[1:42:54] not saying that her dress has to drag
[1:42:56] the ground I'm not saying anything like
[1:42:59] that but I'm saying that even the the
[1:43:01] United Pentecostal Church out there they
[1:43:04] they even understand how that standards
[1:43:07] have changed Through The Years skirts
[1:43:11] shorter and heels higher and necklines
[1:43:14] lower and what we're doing and what
[1:43:17] we're seeing and the trend that we're
[1:43:19] seeing in in in in the 50s and 60s they
[1:43:23] preached against the split in the skirt
[1:43:25] and they were only about an inch or two
[1:43:27] inches in that time and now you'll see
[1:43:30] uh UPC and Pentecostal women sometime
[1:43:33] with a split that goes all the way up to
[1:43:35] their hip and when they walk the one
[1:43:38] goes one way and one goes the other and
[1:43:40] you see they're underneath
[1:43:43] garments I remember it's it didn't
[1:43:46] matter to me if it's quiet it
[1:43:50] doesn't uh I remember when they started
[1:43:53] cutting their
[1:43:55] bangs hair way down in the back but they
[1:43:58] started cutting their
[1:44:01] bangs I remember the trend of the
[1:44:03] Jackson nightes around this message who
[1:44:06] began to say you can cut your hair an
[1:44:08] inch at a
[1:44:09] time and now if you saw some of those
[1:44:12] women it's way up to here died
[1:44:15] blue old
[1:44:17] women because there's no such thing as
[1:44:20] an inch at a time whether it's your head
[1:44:23] or your skirt there's no such thing
[1:44:26] because the enemy will not stop until a
[1:44:30] woman who is sold out to God has
[1:44:34] embraced first one thing then another
[1:44:37] thing then another thing then another
[1:44:38] thing then another thing a and now now
[1:44:43] they wear slacks to
[1:44:45] church
[1:44:48] Pentecostals now the women wear slacks
[1:44:50] to church hair all cut and perm Med
[1:44:54] colored unnatural colors that God never
[1:44:58] even placed on any child's head when
[1:45:01] they were born come on now there there's
[1:45:04] just no stopping to are you going to
[1:45:06] preach this way the whole two hours I
[1:45:09] might if I think you don't want me to I
[1:45:12] might but I want you to understand that
[1:45:14] it's not these individual things that
[1:45:16] matter I'm not even saying that all
[1:45:19] these little things are big deals some
[1:45:21] of them are not big deals but the
[1:45:23] prophet Isaiah said whatever's going on
[1:45:26] has caused the women to be proud to be
[1:45:30] hoty to look down on other people in in
[1:45:34] a in almost a self-righteous way how
[1:45:37] many of you know there should be no
[1:45:39] bride Pride either but by the grace of
[1:45:42] God there go you and I we could have
[1:45:46] followed the trend we could have
[1:45:48] followed the fad we could have followed
[1:45:51] the downslide of the Pentecostal church
[1:45:54] but God called us
[1:45:56] out not so that we could turn around 30
[1:45:59] years later and follow their
[1:46:01] Trends he called us out so that we could
[1:46:04] stand in resistance to what the church
[1:46:07] has
[1:46:08] become not in judgment but in
[1:46:12] shining glowing the goodness and the
[1:46:15] grace of Jesus Christ to a world that's
[1:46:18] around us unsettled unsure unanchored
[1:46:23] the church has become
[1:46:24] unanchored because she doesn't have much
[1:46:27] of an absolute
[1:46:28] anymore
[1:46:30] amen she couldn't stop with a wedding
[1:46:35] band or just some simple ring she had to
[1:46:38] have a great big old
[1:46:40] Diamond just like the Pentecostal Church
[1:46:43] world just like the world out there and
[1:46:46] you take that on the next thing you know
[1:46:48] then that same old Godly sister next
[1:46:51] thing you know she'll have to have a
[1:46:52] mother ring and a grandmother's
[1:46:55] ring now she's got a whole collection of
[1:46:58] of necklaces and things her husband has
[1:47:00] given her now her older Sons will start
[1:47:02] giving her and she can't hurt their
[1:47:05] feelings and and she's gotten so in love
[1:47:07] with these
[1:47:09] dainties that now she asks for them for
[1:47:13] Christmas she tells them what she wants
[1:47:16] so that she can then tell others who
[1:47:17] might mention it I didn't buy it for
[1:47:20] myself
[1:47:23] it was bought for me by someone
[1:47:26] else and now we see sisters who are are
[1:47:30] using the
[1:47:32] mascara brother Bram called it
[1:47:35] manicure and now we see the sisters who
[1:47:39] can't stop with that it gets thicker and
[1:47:41] thicker and thicker and thicker green
[1:47:44] blue purple yellow
[1:47:47] hello the prophet Isaiah oh my there was
[1:47:50] a time that when I preached like this
[1:47:52] you couldn't hear me for the people
[1:47:55] you're proving my point you're proving
[1:47:58] my point some of us have drifted so far
[1:48:02] from the
[1:48:05] absolute that we're in shock we can't
[1:48:07] say Amen CZ we're in shocked that we've
[1:48:09] gone back to
[1:48:11] that our enemies even criticize us the
[1:48:14] critics of this message even criticize
[1:48:17] it us because they say they change their
[1:48:20] rules as often as any other church and
[1:48:23] they never even tell anybody when
[1:48:25] they're
[1:48:27] changed when was it all
[1:48:30] right when was it all right to start
[1:48:33] doing such and such and be a part of the
[1:48:36] end time bride of Jesus Christ is it
[1:48:38] really about all these things it really
[1:48:42] is because the abundance of the
[1:48:46] inside are you with me I don't want that
[1:48:50] hotess in this church I don't want us to
[1:48:53] walk under that kind of a thing so let's
[1:48:56] ask the Holy Ghost to guide us let's ask
[1:48:59] the spirit of the lord always you won't
[1:49:01] hear me going around condemning you I
[1:49:04] rarely say things like this I'm not here
[1:49:07] to make you mad I'm not here to give you
[1:49:10] indigestion I'm just here to remind you
[1:49:12] that from time to time we need to stop
[1:49:15] and re-evaluate ourselves and see if
[1:49:18] we're tinkling like the Pentecostal are
[1:49:20] we tinkling like the world
[1:49:23] or are we shining with the light of the
[1:49:26] love of Jesus Christ are you with me you
[1:49:31] know these women that he's talking about
[1:49:33] some of these descriptions we don't
[1:49:35] understand unless we look them up some
[1:49:36] of them are perfume boxes can you
[1:49:38] imagine walking around with your perfume
[1:49:40] box in your
[1:49:41] hand this is not our
[1:49:44] culture but it was some of the Heathen
[1:49:46] cultures of the day so here are the
[1:49:48] daughters of Zion walking around with
[1:49:50] their mirrors
[1:49:52] tied to their
[1:49:54] wrist and their perfume boxes in their
[1:50:01] hand SAS and let's don't get the twist
[1:50:04] out you
[1:50:05] know and the prophet looks at it he sees
[1:50:08] it and sees it and sees it until one day
[1:50:10] the word of the Lord comes bubbling up
[1:50:12] out of him and he said you you're so
[1:50:15] much like the other
[1:50:17] nations long gone are the days that
[1:50:21] people could see us and and know what we
[1:50:23] stood
[1:50:24] for long gone are the days that people
[1:50:27] would say they're those Jesus
[1:50:29] Freaks long gone are the days that they
[1:50:32] would say that's those Jesus name
[1:50:34] baptized people there because the church
[1:50:37] has slid so far
[1:50:40] back and he begins to
[1:50:42] prophesy he begins to talk about all of
[1:50:45] the different things the the r nose
[1:50:49] rings and the and the jewels and the
[1:50:51] boring of the ear so that they becomes
[1:50:54] I'm not here to condemn
[1:50:57] anybody but just watch the
[1:50:59] trends then first the bank then the
[1:51:03] rest I saw it the women the Pentecostal
[1:51:06] church quit stopped preaching against
[1:51:08] women with earbobs and so then the men
[1:51:11] started getting them and and now look
[1:51:14] when the man first started wearing
[1:51:15] earrings they called him
[1:51:19] gay they called him Gay and now he's so
[1:51:21] confused he doesn't know what it
[1:51:25] is the world is so messed up now they've
[1:51:28] so blurred the
[1:51:30] genders that they're spending government
[1:51:33] tax dollars as I told you last Sunday to
[1:51:36] to uh investigate
[1:51:39] research the the monthly
[1:51:42] cycles of transgendered
[1:51:46] men that shouldn't take
[1:51:50] long you can change the anatomy but but
[1:51:54] it's it's a little bit harder on the
[1:51:56] inside Plumbing
[1:51:58] sometime you you can hormone the
[1:52:01] whiskers
[1:52:02] off you can hormone the deep voice off
[1:52:06] but that doesn't mean you can so just
[1:52:08] because a man is transgender doesn't
[1:52:10] mean he's going to start having a
[1:52:12] monthly cycle but government your tax
[1:52:15] money paying for such as that are you
[1:52:17] trying to tell us that you believe that
[1:52:19] these things are
[1:52:21] fruits of the mixing and blending of the
[1:52:24] Gingers and what the church used to cry
[1:52:26] absolutely I believe we're reaping the
[1:52:30] Harvest because nobody would tell it
[1:52:32] when it got
[1:52:33] unpopular to tell it in the message and
[1:52:37] I'm moving on eventually when their eyes
[1:52:41] were open they knew him toir California
[1:52:46] paragraph 112 brother vandom said and
[1:52:48] then the daughters of Zion would walk
[1:52:50] hoty in the last days
[1:52:53] they would fail to walk after the Lord
[1:52:55] no matter what you say to them you can
[1:52:58] just preach and preach and
[1:53:03] preach it's just like hitting against
[1:53:05] that wall over there it's a dense
[1:53:09] Darkness upon
[1:53:11] them there is seems to be so hard to
[1:53:14] find a genuine man that's
[1:53:16] man and and and to find a woman that's
[1:53:19] really a lady come
[1:53:21] on look look upon the streets today upon
[1:53:24] the screens our screens and wherever it
[1:53:27] is these uncensored programs I want you
[1:53:31] to notice what brother brandom's talking
[1:53:32] about his uncensored program cigarette
[1:53:34] smoking oh this greatly Disturbed
[1:53:37] brother brandom that Lucy
[1:53:41] smoked she wore pedal
[1:53:44] pushers long shorts like they call Capri
[1:53:47] called them pedal pushers then and
[1:53:50] smoked and brother Brandon was so
[1:53:52] disturbed by that what in this world do
[1:53:54] you think that he would think about what
[1:53:58] they do on television
[1:54:01] today all manner of things say all
[1:54:03] manner of things he said smoking cussing
[1:54:07] carrying on dressing like man and things
[1:54:09] Jesus said those things would be and
[1:54:11] they're here he said they don't need no
[1:54:14] revealing they are ready already
[1:54:17] revealed he said now watch as it was in
[1:54:21] the days of lot look at the setting of
[1:54:22] lot God come down and in two man went
[1:54:25] down into Sodom and preached down in
[1:54:27] Sodom one man sat up there with Abraham
[1:54:30] the elected Church type of the
[1:54:31] Pentecostal called out today not in
[1:54:34] Sodom out there those who live among
[1:54:38] Pentecostals women who cut their hair
[1:54:41] and man who carry on like that and tell
[1:54:43] those dirty jokes and carry on they're
[1:54:46] not Pentecostals they're just carrying a
[1:54:49] name
[1:54:51] Pentecostal he said they're not
[1:54:53] Pentecostal genuine Pentecostal ladies
[1:54:56] are and genuine Pentecostal man are
[1:55:02] man he said the schools almost having to
[1:55:05] close for young verted boys being
[1:55:09] perverts and things like that in the
[1:55:11] school homosexuals all over everywhere
[1:55:14] it's just a sickening sight as it was in
[1:55:18] the days of Sodom so shall it be in the
[1:55:22] coming of the son of man he just typed
[1:55:27] it to the
[1:55:29] word it's the downward Trend it's the
[1:55:33] slippery slope and if it was only out
[1:55:36] there we could lock ourselves away in
[1:55:40] some little box somewhere but it's not
[1:55:42] just out there it'll creep right in
[1:55:45] among
[1:55:46] us if we don't make a stand and you
[1:55:50] ought to amen the word if you have to
[1:55:52] follow it with an oh
[1:55:54] me is this the thing that matters the
[1:55:56] most no it doesn't matter the most what
[1:55:59] matters the most is are you born again
[1:56:02] are you washed in the blood of Jesus
[1:56:05] Christ baptized in his name Sanctified
[1:56:09] by the word filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:56:12] that is the main thing but there are
[1:56:15] other things that follow the main
[1:56:18] attraction and these are those things
[1:56:21] come out from among
[1:56:24] them amen and be separate sayeth the
[1:56:28] Lord is anybody with us so this was
[1:56:32] purum this week wasn't
[1:56:35] it could I encourage somebody just to
[1:56:38] turn the the I think it may be the
[1:56:41] monitor might be there just down just a
[1:56:43] hair because I I'm holding back a little
[1:56:46] bit because I think I'm loud and it
[1:56:48] won't be extra loud we were looking at
[1:56:51] purum
[1:56:53] it is a it's a Time the Bible
[1:56:55] mentions mentioned in the Bible it means
[1:56:59] Lots because the casting of lots was
[1:57:03] going on in the story and you know a
[1:57:05] little bit about it and and and and what
[1:57:08] a perfect time to look at Esther just a
[1:57:11] little bit before we go home
[1:57:13] today in the scripture if you were to
[1:57:16] call her by Hebrew name it would be
[1:57:20] hadassa Esther is a Persian
[1:57:23] name it's a name that she would have
[1:57:26] carried living in the Persian Kingdom
[1:57:30] where she was living her Hebrew name
[1:57:33] would have been
[1:57:35] hadasa and there is something about
[1:57:37] Esther there's something about hadasa
[1:57:41] that stands in such open contrast to the
[1:57:45] description that we just read about the
[1:57:48] daughters of Zion they had a mentality
[1:57:51] the more put on the more beautiful I am
[1:57:54] Esther had a different mentality she
[1:57:57] said if he's going to love me he's got
[1:57:59] to love me for who I am if he finds
[1:58:02] attraction in me it's going to have to
[1:58:04] be my character it's going to have to be
[1:58:07] my demeanor it's going to have to be my
[1:58:10] spirit because I'm not attracted to the
[1:58:12] things that the other girls seem to be
[1:58:17] so attracted to are you are you here
[1:58:22] and and I I think it would be good to
[1:58:24] look at this for just a moment in Esther
[1:58:27] chap 2 verse 1-3 after these things when
[1:58:31] the wrath of King azeris was appeased he
[1:58:35] remembered vashy and I noticed that some
[1:58:38] people pronounce it Vash Tha it doesn't
[1:58:40] matter to me how you pronounce it we'll
[1:58:42] get it and what she had done and what
[1:58:45] was decreed against her does anybody
[1:58:48] remember that vashy was the wife she was
[1:58:51] the queen
[1:58:52] of King
[1:58:53] aashis also known as
[1:58:57] Xerxes and she had been called by the
[1:59:01] king to a feast and she showed him the
[1:59:06] ultimate
[1:59:07] disrespect by refusing his invitation to
[1:59:11] come and appear and sit by his side at
[1:59:15] this great banquet that he had uh called
[1:59:19] and let's look at it here after these
[1:59:22] things when the wrath of King azeris was
[1:59:24] appeased he remembered vashy and what
[1:59:27] she had done at what was decreed against
[1:59:30] her then said the king's servants that
[1:59:33] ministered unto him let there be fair
[1:59:37] young virgins sought for the king he had
[1:59:40] put her away because she refused to come
[1:59:43] to him and uh so let the king appoint
[1:59:47] officers in all the provinces of his
[1:59:49] kingdom that they may gather together
[1:59:52] all the fair young virgins un shushan
[1:59:55] the palace to the house of the women
[1:59:57] under the custody of heay the king's
[2:00:01] Chamberlain Keeper of the women and let
[2:00:04] their things for purification be given
[2:00:08] them we find that Esther was a woman of
[2:00:11] grace and favor she was a woman who
[2:00:14] unselfishly surrendered her life to
[2:00:17] please the king and to save her people
[2:00:21] from Ultimate
[2:00:22] destruction history records that the
[2:00:25] king the kingdom of King azeris
[2:00:28] stretched all the way from India to
[2:00:32] Ethiopia I don't know if you've got a
[2:00:34] bind to remember the the map the
[2:00:37] geography in your mind I didn't bring a
[2:00:39] map with me to show you but from India
[2:00:42] to Ethiopia a king azeris owned that was
[2:00:47] his kingdom he ruled in that massive
[2:00:51] piece of land massive land he was
[2:00:56] perhaps the richest landowner of his
[2:01:00] time we read that the kingdom had a
[2:01:04] headquarters it had a capital and the
[2:01:07] capital was called what shushan and
[2:01:10] shushan do you know what shushan means
[2:01:13] it means Lily the city of the Lily we
[2:01:17] know in the Bible that Lily is a symbol
[2:01:21] of the BR Paradigm we read in the Song
[2:01:24] of Solomon I am my beloveds and my
[2:01:28] beloved is mine he feedeth among the
[2:01:32] lies in the story of Esther there's
[2:01:36] about to be a royal wedding in The Lily
[2:01:38] City stay with me in the third year of
[2:01:41] the reign of King azaris also known as
[2:01:44] Xerxes he made a feast for all of his
[2:01:47] princes and his servants he wanted to
[2:01:51] show them The Riches of his kingdom it
[2:01:54] sounds like he had a little pride too
[2:01:57] verse four of chapter 1 tells us that
[2:02:00] the feast that he prepared lasted six
[2:02:03] months when it was over he invited local
[2:02:06] towns people to come for a feast at the
[2:02:09] palace that lasted seven days so six
[2:02:12] months and another week they have
[2:02:15] feasted they have celebrated the kingdom
[2:02:18] of King Aeris every guest
[2:02:22] you talk about a party favor every guest
[2:02:25] that came to the feast was given vessels
[2:02:28] of gold each one a little different from
[2:02:31] the next but every one of them having
[2:02:34] great value I I I've carried a few
[2:02:38] goodie bags home a popcorn and a candy
[2:02:41] bar how many of you think about going to
[2:02:43] a feast where you'd be given a golden
[2:02:46] vessel almost retirement uh in your in
[2:02:49] your bag as you were leaving there and
[2:02:53] they were filled these vessels were
[2:02:55] sealed and filled with the Royal Wine of
[2:02:58] the king that no commoner had ever
[2:03:01] tasted the story of Esther begins with
[2:03:05] the king's wife vashy who was known to
[2:03:07] be the most beautiful woman in the whole
[2:03:10] Kingdom of King azeris she started to
[2:03:14] behave herself unseemingly as a queen
[2:03:18] and she showed it publicly before the
[2:03:21] entire Kingdom her complete disrespect
[2:03:24] for her husband refusing to appear at
[2:03:28] his banquet she's then put away by the
[2:03:30] king follow the story she's put away by
[2:03:33] the king and he begins a search for a
[2:03:36] new Queen Fair virgins from throughout
[2:03:39] the land were sought for the king to
[2:03:42] inspect and to choose his next Queen in
[2:03:46] in Esther chap 2:7 there is a devout Jew
[2:03:50] who's mentioned how many of you know his
[2:03:53] name his name is Mori some would say
[2:03:57] Mori both are correct he had been
[2:04:00] raising his cousin Esther she was not
[2:04:04] his niece the Bible said she was the
[2:04:07] daughter of his uncle how many of you
[2:04:10] know that would have made her a first
[2:04:11] cousin and not a niece Mori loved Esther
[2:04:17] he loved hadassa as his own daughter her
[2:04:21] parents had been brutally murdered and
[2:04:24] he had taken her in as his own he loved
[2:04:28] her like she was his own daughter morai
[2:04:32] began to hear that the King was taking
[2:04:34] in Fair virgins for a purification
[2:04:38] process that would end in King azeris
[2:04:42] choosing a new Queen morai grabbed
[2:04:46] Esther by the arm and ran with her as
[2:04:51] fast as he could to the Palace because
[2:04:53] he knew that this was his opportunity to
[2:04:58] preserve and to protect his people the
[2:05:01] Jews why were they in Persia because
[2:05:05] they had been taken captive there she
[2:05:08] hid herself among the people as a Jewish
[2:05:12] she didn't tell people who she was no
[2:05:15] one really knew her true identity they
[2:05:18] had been keeping it very quiet her in
[2:05:21] entire life Mori told Esther in
[2:05:24] scripture don't show your people don't
[2:05:27] show your Kindred don't let anybody know
[2:05:30] who you are don't tell anybody where
[2:05:32] you're from he knew there was great
[2:05:35] danger in her revealing her true
[2:05:37] identity if she told somebody who she
[2:05:40] was her life could be taken because even
[2:05:44] as it is in our day there were Jew
[2:05:46] haters in high
[2:05:48] places in the days of Esther and Mori
[2:05:52] many virgins from all over the kingdom
[2:05:55] now you just think about the contrast
[2:05:57] between the the the complexion and the
[2:06:00] features of a woman from India the
[2:06:03] complexions and features of a woman from
[2:06:05] Ethiopia and everything in between there
[2:06:08] must have been some beautiful young
[2:06:10] women gathered in uh as candidates for
[2:06:14] the next Queen I can only imagine it
[2:06:17] must have been more beautiful than a
[2:06:20] modern uh beauty contest all of them
[2:06:24] vying competing desperate to be the
[2:06:29] queen you know why because they wanted
[2:06:32] the curlers and they wanted the
[2:06:33] bracelets and they wanted all the Royal
[2:06:36] things they wanted to enjoy the
[2:06:39] lifestyle all the things that Esther
[2:06:41] didn't really care anything about they
[2:06:43] wanted they were
[2:06:45] jealous they were envious come on they
[2:06:49] wanted to outdo one another and here
[2:06:52] comes little Esther into the mix they
[2:06:56] came from all over their goal was to
[2:06:59] stand out from the
[2:07:01] rest I've got to I've got to be prettier
[2:07:04] I've got to walk more sensual I've got
[2:07:07] to be more appealing than all of the
[2:07:09] other candidates if I don't I'll be lost
[2:07:12] in the crowd he won't find me as special
[2:07:16] he won't choose me and each one was told
[2:07:19] to request the thing things that she
[2:07:22] would require in order for her to be the
[2:07:26] most desirable to the king that he might
[2:07:29] choose her before she would do this she
[2:07:33] had to go through a purification process
[2:07:37] that lasted an entire year can you
[2:07:39] imagine in Esther 212 we're going
[2:07:42] through this quickly and yes I'm reading
[2:07:43] it now when but I wrote it so I can read
[2:07:46] it now when every maid's turn was come
[2:07:49] to go into king azeris after that she
[2:07:51] had been 12 months according to the
[2:07:55] manner of women completely locked away
[2:07:57] from society for so were the days of
[2:08:00] their purifications accomplished to it
[2:08:03] six months with oil of myrrh and six
[2:08:08] months with sweet odors and with other
[2:08:11] things for the purifying of the women
[2:08:13] they
[2:08:14] bathed in these
[2:08:18] amazing costly oils
[2:08:23] they rinsed off dried off and then they
[2:08:27] were
[2:08:28] Anointed with these oils the oils were
[2:08:32] rubbed into their skin so that one year
[2:08:36] later there was no need for deodorant
[2:08:40] there was no need for perfume the the
[2:08:43] fragrance of these costly oils myrr and
[2:08:46] sweet odors was it literally soaked into
[2:08:50] the same cells of their body and when
[2:08:53] they walked they smelt like a garden can
[2:08:57] you imagine it would have been an
[2:08:59] amazing thing it said now when every
[2:09:03] Mage turned this was six months in myrr
[2:09:06] and six months in sweet
[2:09:09] odors where sister Anita wrote that you
[2:09:13] know she wrote that song I may have
[2:09:15] given you the words uh I don't want to
[2:09:17] jump around too much but sister Anita
[2:09:20] wrote this song saturated in your
[2:09:22] presence as your oil flows down from
[2:09:26] heaven washing deep inside of me it's a
[2:09:30] mixture of suffering that's myrrh a
[2:09:33] bitter a bitter herb a bitter oil and
[2:09:37] blessing that's the sweet
[2:09:40] perfumes it's a mixture of suffering and
[2:09:43] blessing until I come
[2:09:47] out say that again would you
[2:09:51] not like you not like the
[2:09:55] world not like
[2:09:57] Canaanites
[2:09:59] amalekites like
[2:10:01] you wherever I walk your scent flows
[2:10:06] from me emitting the fragrance of the
[2:10:11] Lamb I want to take just a minute since
[2:10:14] some of you are in in a strange place
[2:10:16] right now I want to take just a minute
[2:10:19] to read you again and EXP experience
[2:10:21] that I had in the spirit concerning
[2:10:24] little Esther and I'm going to read it
[2:10:27] as the familiar scenery of my bedroom
[2:10:29] faded away I realized I was entering the
[2:10:32] realm of spiritual vision I saw a young
[2:10:35] lady standing in front of me she was
[2:10:37] attractive but not particularly
[2:10:39] beautiful she had a long slender neck
[2:10:42] and strong facial features it was
[2:10:45] evident to me that there was something
[2:10:46] very special about this young woman
[2:10:49] suddenly I Heard a Voice
[2:10:51] proclaiming from the spirit for such a
[2:10:55] time as this I immediately recognize
[2:10:59] this young lady to be Esther the
[2:11:01] biblical hadassa heroine of the Jewish
[2:11:05] people The Voice then spoke this is the
[2:11:09] appointed time suddenly I began to see
[2:11:13] something falling down on her it looked
[2:11:17] like rain it appeared to be small drops
[2:11:21] of beautiful golden oil they were
[2:11:23] teardrop shaped and transparent and I
[2:11:26] could see by the way they fell on her
[2:11:28] that the drops were heavy I perceived
[2:11:32] that they were drops representing his
[2:11:34] glory representing the atmosphere of
[2:11:37] Heaven and the Manifest presence of
[2:11:39] Jesus a remarkable transformation was
[2:11:43] unfolding in this shower of God's glory
[2:11:46] I could still see her young strong
[2:11:49] features but there was an ex exquisite
[2:11:51] beauty that now began to radiate from
[2:11:55] her that was not present just a few
[2:11:57] moments ago the glory had anointed her
[2:12:01] the glory had transformed her the glory
[2:12:05] had changed her she was being prepared
[2:12:08] for her Destiny
[2:12:11] transfigured before my eyes Queen Esther
[2:12:15] beautifully exemplifies the Bride of
[2:12:18] Jesus Christ as his bride you and I too
[2:12:22] are going through significant
[2:12:25] preparation to fulfill God's plan for
[2:12:28] our lives how about an amen for six
[2:12:31] months she was anointed with myrr a
[2:12:33] spice that represents suffering
[2:12:35] suffering is a necessary ingredient in
[2:12:38] our preparation process but remember I
[2:12:41] want you to remember that suffering is
[2:12:44] only a portion of the recipe after 6
[2:12:47] months of myrr she was anointed for six
[2:12:50] additional months with sweet smelling
[2:12:52] spices one of these spices was calamus
[2:12:55] its root meaning speaks to us of divine
[2:12:57] order the number 12 the total number of
[2:13:00] months in their preparation it
[2:13:03] communicates government not just any
[2:13:05] government but the government of
[2:13:07] almighty God it's time listen it's time
[2:13:11] for the government it's time it's
[2:13:14] time I feel that it's time for the
[2:13:18] divine order and the government of the
[2:13:21] Lord to be reflected in our lives
[2:13:24] instead of
[2:13:25] chaos instead of
[2:13:28] confusion instead of
[2:13:31] panic instead of
[2:13:34] anxiety instead of
[2:13:36] worldliness instead of
[2:13:38] paganism it's time that this little
[2:13:41] bride begin to reflect the divine order
[2:13:45] and the Divine government of God he's an
[2:13:47] ordered God he's a God who is meticulous
[2:13:50] in design and in desire are you here uh
[2:13:55] so it goes on it's time for the divine
[2:13:59] order and government of the Lord to be
[2:14:00] reflected in our lives it is time to
[2:14:03] discover how he wants his business
[2:14:05] conducted in the Earth this is what I've
[2:14:07] been asking him for so long now another
[2:14:10] one of these spices was frankincense a
[2:14:13] fragrance whose Aroma is only
[2:14:16] released when it's
[2:14:19] burned it is either has to be distilled
[2:14:23] or burned for it to release any
[2:14:25] fragrance at all it smells otherwise
[2:14:28] just Earthly the resin itself just
[2:14:31] smells earthy but the real fragrance of
[2:14:35] Frankincense is only released through
[2:14:37] the burning process or a distilling with
[2:14:40] hot water or steam it's the only way you
[2:14:42] can get the fragrance at all in fact we
[2:14:45] should now implore the Lord I want this
[2:14:49] fill us with a Holy Fire that we may
[2:14:53] emit all of his fragrance to a hopeless
[2:14:56] generation that while rejecting
[2:14:59] religious trappings Longs for reality
[2:15:02] and fulfillment we recognize that all
[2:15:05] the young female candidates underwent
[2:15:07] the same process of purification and
[2:15:10] anointing before their moment with the
[2:15:12] King But ultimately it was the king's
[2:15:15] decision who he would choose who would
[2:15:18] be his Queen in my experience erience I
[2:15:21] believe it was only after all the months
[2:15:23] of grooming and preparation had
[2:15:26] concluded that she began to be showered
[2:15:29] with a golden Glory a rain set from
[2:15:31] heaven for an appointed time
[2:15:33] transforming her to reflect everything
[2:15:36] that Jesus is thus making his Beauty
[2:15:39] visible in her the Bride of Jesus has
[2:15:42] been enduring lengthy days months and
[2:15:45] years of preparation we have experienced
[2:15:48] both the pain of myrr and the profound
[2:15:51] blessing of his sweetness and yet we
[2:15:54] persevere and yet we press on because we
[2:15:57] know that God is preparing us for a
[2:16:01] quick short work to manifest the very
[2:16:04] character and life of Jesus Christ in
[2:16:07] the Earth are you here verse 13 chapter
[2:16:10] 2 then thus came every Maiden unto the
[2:16:14] king whatsoever she desired was given
[2:16:17] her to go with her out of the house of
[2:16:19] the women into the king's house one by
[2:16:22] one one by one they all had their
[2:16:26] evening they all had their
[2:16:29] appointment with King
[2:16:31] aeras some took
[2:16:37] snacks some thought the king would be
[2:16:40] Bunchy and they took
[2:16:43] Pringles or whatever the uh snack of the
[2:16:47] day
[2:16:48] was they took bags
[2:16:53] vessels to impress the
[2:16:57] king some would spread a banquet for
[2:17:01] him they would choose their
[2:17:05] down many of them very
[2:17:08] provocative hoping for an
[2:17:11] opportunity to have familiar relations
[2:17:15] with the
[2:17:16] King and to make that moment so
[2:17:19] impressive
[2:17:21] that he would without a doubt choose
[2:17:26] them one by one they were rejected they
[2:17:31] came with their gowns they came with
[2:17:33] their oders they came with their fans
[2:17:36] they came with their snacks they came
[2:17:39] with all of their trappings they were
[2:17:42] allowed to ask for anything in the
[2:17:44] king's possession that that they desired
[2:17:48] to make themselves more appealing to
[2:17:51] make themselves more desirable after all
[2:17:54] it was a
[2:17:55] contest it was a it was an ancient
[2:17:59] Survivor like they have in in modern
[2:18:02] days not Survivor uh Bachelor or
[2:18:06] Bachelorette or something like that
[2:18:08] where they line up these all these women
[2:18:11] uh to try out for men and vice versa it
[2:18:15] was sort of like that with no no TV
[2:18:18] cameras this was real life do you
[2:18:20] understand stand every Maiden would then
[2:18:23] gather the things they desired some
[2:18:25] gathered makeup some various cosmetics
[2:18:29] and and lotions and jewelry fashionable
[2:18:33] accessories and extravagant gowns and
[2:18:36] and brooches and pins for their hair
[2:18:39] even exotic gifts from the king's own
[2:18:42] treasure room and they were hoping that
[2:18:45] he would see something that he
[2:18:46] particularly adored and they would pin
[2:18:49] them on their cloth and they would go in
[2:18:52] hoping that he would see his own
[2:18:53] treasure and he would think oh what a
[2:18:56] thoughtful what a thoughtful young lady
[2:18:58] she is to bring my most treasured uh
[2:19:02] possession to wear it in here they were
[2:19:05] looking for a strategy they wanted to be
[2:19:08] more appealing to the king just like the
[2:19:10] women of Zion wanted to be more
[2:19:13] appealing to the outside Community just
[2:19:16] like the women around the message want
[2:19:18] to be more accepted
[2:19:20] when they go to
[2:19:22] Walmart they don't want to be looked at
[2:19:24] as quite fogy they don't want to be
[2:19:27] looked at as
[2:19:29] pilgrims they want to be as fashionable
[2:19:31] as possible they want to have as much
[2:19:34] color as they can possibly have without
[2:19:37] what you'd say smearing it on they want
[2:19:39] to have as many tinkling sounds so they
[2:19:43] can fit in with everybody else but I
[2:19:45] want you to know Esther had another
[2:19:47] strategy if Esther represents the bride
[2:19:50] then the bride better have another
[2:19:51] strategy we better have another strategy
[2:19:54] you better hear what I'm saying now we
[2:19:57] better have another
[2:19:59] strategy to capture the attention of the
[2:20:02] king anything they believed would get
[2:20:05] them chosen anything they made
[2:20:09] assumptions it's not a good idea to make
[2:20:13] assumptions about what pleases
[2:20:16] him we've got the manual
[2:20:20] we've got the
[2:20:22] book he tells us what pleases him you've
[2:20:26] got to know the manual you've got to
[2:20:28] know the book you've got to eat the book
[2:20:32] you've got to become a part of the book
[2:20:34] and the open book to be a part of you so
[2:20:38] that he's attracted I want you to know
[2:20:40] something the bridegroom is attracted to
[2:20:42] the word he is the word it's not your
[2:20:46] your Earthly smell it's not your Earthly
[2:20:49] trinkets gadgets and and and add-ons
[2:20:53] that draws his favor it's a people that
[2:20:57] are
[2:20:58] transformed by the word amen I'm going
[2:21:02] to take just another minute take a
[2:21:03] little water pause a moment hallelujah
[2:21:05] praise God we're getting through
[2:21:12] it but
[2:21:15] Esther oh
[2:21:17] no Esther desired and requ ired and
[2:21:22] requested nothing but only what the
[2:21:24] king's
[2:21:29] unic had charge of her he
[2:21:33] selected did you know this unic you know
[2:21:37] what that means don't you
[2:21:42] castrated he
[2:21:44] was a
[2:21:46] servant totally sold
[2:21:49] out the king never had to worry about
[2:21:51] him being among the
[2:21:55] heram he was totally
[2:21:58] dedicated it appears that Esther found
[2:22:01] some unusual favor in his eyes because
[2:22:06] the Bible says that he specifically
[2:22:09] chose a few to serve and to help Esther
[2:22:13] and to prepare Esther and he pulled them
[2:22:15] away into a safe place and she began to
[2:22:19] inquire of him
[2:22:21] what the king is like hear me tell me
[2:22:25] what he's
[2:22:26] like tell me what he
[2:22:28] loves tell me what he's interested in
[2:22:32] can you tell me what his favorite
[2:22:33] fragrance is can you tell me how he
[2:22:36] wants his Queen to
[2:22:38] dress can you tell me what he finds
[2:22:42] beautiful I want you to know she was a
[2:22:45] smart little
[2:22:47] girl she wasn't going to assume
[2:22:51] what she could use to to gain his favor
[2:22:54] she was going to find out what he
[2:22:57] liked aren't you glad you
[2:23:00] know I'll pull you I'm going to pull you
[2:23:03] if I have to I'm GNA pull
[2:23:05] you I'm going pull
[2:23:07] you I may not want to preach this any
[2:23:09] more than you want to hear it but I'm
[2:23:11] going to pull you all the
[2:23:13] way I may remind you from time to time
[2:23:17] verse 15 of chapter 2 now when the turn
[2:23:20] of ES the daughter of Abel the uncle of
[2:23:23] Mori who had taken her for his daughter
[2:23:26] was come to go in into the king she
[2:23:28] required
[2:23:30] nothing nothing but what he
[2:23:32] gave and and some people put an eye on
[2:23:35] it but the eye is not there in the
[2:23:37] Hebrew but in English you can certainly
[2:23:39] put it you can say uh higi the king's
[2:23:43] Chamberlain The Keeper of the women
[2:23:45] appointed just whatever he suggested and
[2:23:48] Esther obtained favor in the sight of
[2:23:52] all them that looked upon her and the
[2:23:56] Bible only records 6 months of my six
[2:23:59] months of sweet fragrance sweet odors
[2:24:02] and with other things that women are
[2:24:04] purified by and that's all she took
[2:24:07] in we don't know much about her gown we
[2:24:10] don't know much about anything else that
[2:24:13] she carried with her but we are led to
[2:24:15] to assume and to believe that she just
[2:24:18] went in like that
[2:24:21] and yet attractive and beautiful to
[2:24:23] everyone who looked upon her without all
[2:24:26] the stuff that the other girls carried
[2:24:30] brother brandham says in the mean a
[2:24:31] message called the meanest man in Santa
[2:24:34] Maria paragraph 83 do you think you know
[2:24:37] that
[2:24:38] man the meanest man in Lee
[2:24:41] County and the new birth is the same
[2:24:44] thing it's a mess but it comes life out
[2:24:48] of that mess only way you can receive
[2:24:51] life is through a birth it's messy but
[2:24:54] it makes life people try to dodge it
[2:24:57] they don't want to wash the manicure off
[2:24:59] their face some of them now I want you
[2:25:01] to know brother brandom didn't know what
[2:25:03] a manicure
[2:25:08] was he goes on to say what is that you
[2:25:10] call that stuff not not manicure mascara
[2:25:13] he said that's what it is I don't know
[2:25:15] what that crazy stuff is can you imagine
[2:25:19] 1962 I I don't know what that crazy you
[2:25:21] you you'd look a whole lot prettier if
[2:25:23] you wouldn't wear that you would try a
[2:25:26] little Acts 2 and acts 4 it'll beat all
[2:25:29] that Max Factor ever could make I still
[2:25:32] believe that brother brandom I still
[2:25:34] believe that I'll tell you that he said
[2:25:37] if you'll just try a little of that
[2:25:38] it'll be an eternal
[2:25:39] Beauty a sweet Meek quiet Spirit he said
[2:25:45] that's what this woman had that's what
[2:25:47] Esther had when she come before the king
[2:25:49] that's the reason she overrun the other
[2:25:52] girls because she come adorning herself
[2:25:56] with a sweet spirit before him remember
[2:25:59] I'll beautify the meek with salvation
[2:26:01] isn't that what he said I'll make them
[2:26:04] beautiful I'll make them the most
[2:26:05] beautiful and he
[2:26:07] does he does I want you to know a man
[2:26:11] with his with his heart in the right
[2:26:13] place and living by the word he finds
[2:26:16] Holiness the most beautiful expression
[2:26:20] on on a
[2:26:24] woman a man that can't be satisfied
[2:26:27] unless his wife puts red on her lips has
[2:26:31] been looking at too many porn uh
[2:26:33] pornographic
[2:26:38] magazine a man that comes home with uh
[2:26:41] uh
[2:26:42] stilettos and and and needs his wife to
[2:26:45] walk around the house like that as a
[2:26:48] brother once come and told me in this
[2:26:50] this church that he needed his wife to
[2:26:53] do things like that and I said I want
[2:26:57] you to know something she is not
[2:27:02] obligated to perform for
[2:27:05] you dress up like some maid if that's
[2:27:09] what it takes for you to care about your
[2:27:11] wife and show her intimately that you
[2:27:14] love her you need
[2:27:19] Deliverance if a man who's married to a
[2:27:22] Godly woman can't get turned on unless
[2:27:24] she's in red high heel shoes something
[2:27:27] is
[2:27:34] wrong with that
[2:27:38] man and it won't go
[2:27:41] away he won't outgrow
[2:27:46] it oh yes
[2:27:50] he said that's this woman she had a when
[2:27:53] she come before the king she overran the
[2:27:56] other
[2:27:57] girls we know that she came before him
[2:28:01] with the sweet
[2:28:02] Spirit Esther didn't strive to collect
[2:28:06] what she believed would be best for her
[2:28:08] but she understood that the king had his
[2:28:10] own personal preferences I think
[2:28:12] sometime that people forget that the one
[2:28:16] we serve has his own preferences
[2:28:21] and I think it's ignorant of us to want
[2:28:24] to give him an apple
[2:28:26] pie if he prefers a cherry
[2:28:30] pie well I'm going to change him he's
[2:28:34] never tasted my apple pie if he don't
[2:28:37] like apple pie your apple pie is not
[2:28:39] going to be any better than anybody
[2:28:40] else's apple pie why don't you just make
[2:28:43] him a cherry pie why don't we discover
[2:28:46] what pleases the Lord and surrender to
[2:28:50] that I don't care how crazy it seem well
[2:28:53] you're living a pretty narrow life
[2:28:56] there's more out there than
[2:28:58] cherries it's hard for me to preach on
[2:29:00] Cherry Pie because I'm not a cherry pie
[2:29:03] fan but brother brandham said he was so
[2:29:05] I use cherry pie sometime I I there's a
[2:29:08] lot of pies I like better than a cherry
[2:29:11] pie but if I like that I wouldn't want
[2:29:14] my wife to try to change
[2:29:16] me and and and and I find most apple
[2:29:19] pies are are just just average plane but
[2:29:21] I have had some that made me want to be
[2:29:24] an apple pie lover and I had at least
[2:29:28] one Cherry one cherry pie that made me
[2:29:30] think cherry pie could be good but I've
[2:29:33] never had another one since you
[2:29:36] understand why don't we just find out
[2:29:38] what he
[2:29:40] likes if he wants a woman to have uncut
[2:29:43] hair what's the big deal if that pleases
[2:29:47] him somebody say well I want to please
[2:29:49] my husband well if your husband is any
[2:29:51] way in any way
[2:29:53] normal he would probably
[2:29:57] prefer and if he serves God I know he
[2:29:59] would
[2:30:00] prefer I was sitting with brother Perry
[2:30:03] green at a charismatic prophetic
[2:30:06] conference in
[2:30:08] Tucson it was convened by a woman
[2:30:12] preacher we were there
[2:30:14] testifying of the ministry of brother
[2:30:16] brandham I knew brother green was going
[2:30:19] to embarrass me
[2:30:21] me I loved
[2:30:23] him he's one of my best friends but I
[2:30:26] knew he was going to embarrass me so he
[2:30:28] looks over there at the quiet husband of
[2:30:31] a very vocal woman
[2:30:33] preacher and he calls him by name I
[2:30:36] won't and he said I want to ask you
[2:30:39] something he said don't you think and
[2:30:42] you did like
[2:30:43] this he said don't you think and he
[2:30:46] called her name don't you think she'd
[2:30:47] look prettier if she had long
[2:30:52] hair there said his preacher
[2:30:55] wife man's hair do he turned every color
[2:30:59] in the
[2:31:00] book he looked at her she looked at
[2:31:04] him he looked back and he said yes sir I
[2:31:08] believe she
[2:31:11] would he might have been getting a
[2:31:14] whooping when he got home but he
[2:31:17] couldn't help but be honest the reality
[2:31:20] is it doesn't matter what Ron oops that
[2:31:22] was his name doesn't matter what Ron
[2:31:24] liked what matters is what does he want
[2:31:28] what does the king like what pleases him
[2:31:30] that's what we better be figuring out
[2:31:32] okay preach on I believe it will but I
[2:31:34] won't be much longer you see you look at
[2:31:37] that you look at the very word
[2:31:39] haay the unic the Chamberlain you know
[2:31:42] what it means it means a seriousness it
[2:31:45] means meditation it means
[2:31:48] pondering he was a man known to ponder
[2:31:51] the situation to meditate the situation
[2:31:54] and so he figured if I share with her
[2:31:57] the king's true
[2:31:59] desires she will then be the one that is
[2:32:03] chosen and he was
[2:32:05] right he was right while all the others
[2:32:09] did what they thought they should do she
[2:32:11] would have to learn what the king would
[2:32:13] desire from her she dared not assume
[2:32:16] anything to assume means to venture
[2:32:18] without Authority she DED not presume to
[2:32:21] do what she felt she should do to
[2:32:23] presume means to take something for
[2:32:25] granted it couldn't be about Esther it
[2:32:28] couldn't be hear me now even if you're
[2:32:29] mad even if you're all bit out of shape
[2:32:32] even if you don't like me anymore hear
[2:32:34] me it couldn't be about Ester it could
[2:32:37] not be about Esther she could not fight
[2:32:42] for her rights and please the king she
[2:32:46] couldn't say I don't care what he likes
[2:32:49] I'm just going to be
[2:32:52] me it couldn't be about
[2:32:55] Esther it had to be about the
[2:32:58] king why because the very
[2:33:01] future she didn't know what Mori was
[2:33:03] talking about but she believed him she
[2:33:06] loved him she trusted him he said how do
[2:33:09] we
[2:33:11] know how do we know that God is not
[2:33:16] going to use you it it's possible that
[2:33:19] God is going to use you to save your
[2:33:21] people he didn't even perhaps know at
[2:33:23] the moment he hadn't got to for such a
[2:33:26] time as this
[2:33:28] yet he might not have even known the
[2:33:30] full impact of it at the moment but he
[2:33:32] knew he wanted her to be the queen she's
[2:33:35] got to be the queen she's got to be the
[2:33:38] queen the message conflict between God
[2:33:40] and Satan brother Bram said the bride
[2:33:42] must be unified together by the word my
[2:33:45] sheep hear my voice this is his voice on
[2:33:47] printed word printed page I'm sure uh
[2:33:50] unified by the word she makes herself
[2:33:52] ready not with the regular Creed like
[2:33:54] Esther when Esther was to be chosen to
[2:33:56] stand before the king she didn't Adorn
[2:33:58] themselves with all the things she
[2:34:00] adorned herself with a sweet sweet Meek
[2:34:03] Spirit that's what the bride is adorning
[2:34:05] herself with with all the fruits of the
[2:34:07] spirit following
[2:34:09] it what she got assembling together in
[2:34:12] The Fellowship of the word amen
[2:34:14] Fellowship of the word that's right
[2:34:16] fellowshipping sitting together in
[2:34:17] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Jesus
[2:34:20] tonight one Accord one place one Spirit
[2:34:23] one mind one hope one God one
[2:34:27] purpose amen can I have some time thank
[2:34:32] you the marriage of the Lamb paragraph
[2:34:34] 145 said he's going to have a bride that
[2:34:37] hasn't got a wrinkle in her amen she's
[2:34:39] wholly Washed by the blood of his own
[2:34:41] self see so we see where we stand the
[2:34:44] wedding's getting ready to come I will
[2:34:45] hurry but I want to finish this now we
[2:34:47] find how she commits spiritual
[2:34:49] fornication s going out with the world
[2:34:51] professing something living different
[2:34:53] something different that won't never
[2:34:54] work what the church ought to do is do
[2:34:56] like Esther did Esther refused the
[2:34:59] adorning of the world we know that
[2:35:02] little Book of Esther how that mori's
[2:35:04] Uncle had a daughter and was down during
[2:35:06] the times of the Reigns of the mes and
[2:35:07] the Persians a very beautiful type here
[2:35:11] uh or there the king one of the greatest
[2:35:13] kings in the world that day had a great
[2:35:15] feast called the queen to come set by
[2:35:17] him but she wouldn't do it she refused
[2:35:19] to do it so what did he do he was so
[2:35:22] humiliated he didn't know what to do his
[2:35:24] own wife wouldn't come when he
[2:35:31] called anybody ever experienced that
[2:35:39] frustration I've even asked my wife
[2:35:41] please don't tell me I'll be right there
[2:35:43] in a few minutes please
[2:35:46] don't i' I'd almost rather you say
[2:35:49] nothing
[2:35:50] then to tell me I'll get there when I
[2:35:52] can I I don't want I'm not a I'm not a a
[2:35:55] tyrant I want you to know that if I am
[2:35:58] God help me deliver me I don't want to
[2:35:59] be that way but but don't you don't you
[2:36:02] want to your wife to hear you when you
[2:36:04] call to her don't you want her to put
[2:36:06] her phone down long enough to hear what
[2:36:08] you need or what you have to say maybe
[2:36:09] you want to whisper sweet nothing in her
[2:36:11] ear or something and in order to do that
[2:36:13] you'd have to separate her from her
[2:36:14] phone do you understand what I'm saying
[2:36:16] I know you're not going to say am man
[2:36:19] because she's sitting right beside you I
[2:36:22] think that that's a whole lot like
[2:36:23] Christ today he said Christ has invited
[2:36:26] us to sit in Heavenly places with him
[2:36:27] and we're ashamed of it he said many
[2:36:29] people are ashamed to say they got the
[2:36:31] baptism of the Holy
[2:36:33] Ghost Pentecostal
[2:36:35] people they're ashamed to say it that's
[2:36:38] right they're ashamed to say it we're
[2:36:39] ashamed of
[2:36:40] him and so the queen wouldn't come she
[2:36:43] refused to come it humil humiliated him
[2:36:46] his face turned red everybody noticed I
[2:36:49] wonder if Jesus's face don't turn a
[2:36:50] little red too when he calls on us for a
[2:36:52] work calls on the Pentecostal movement
[2:36:54] for fellowship and Brotherhood and we're
[2:36:56] so tightly organized in little groups
[2:36:58] till we won't Bend for the other hello
[2:37:01] we're so getting so early in things
[2:37:03] we're getting ashamed of the name of
[2:37:05] Pentecost you better not tell people
[2:37:07] around this message that you're
[2:37:09] Pentecostal in any shape form or fashion
[2:37:11] they don't like it it's a curse word I'm
[2:37:13] going to tell him every time I get the
[2:37:14] opportunity because brother brandham
[2:37:16] said he was he said I'm glad I got a
[2:37:18] Pentecostal experience experience amen
[2:37:20] I'm glad to Bear the name of Jesus
[2:37:22] Christ it's the greatest privilege I
[2:37:23] ever had to say I'm what part of him now
[2:37:27] we find out that then he got some
[2:37:28] Consultants to ask what he must do and
[2:37:31] they said if this goes on like this all
[2:37:33] the rest of the women throughout the
[2:37:34] country will take it take example of the
[2:37:36] first lady if she refuses to come and
[2:37:40] and he said that's what's happening
[2:37:41] tonight I hope I don't hurt your
[2:37:43] feelings and yet I
[2:37:45] do he said I hope I do uhoh right trying
[2:37:49] to be this here first lady
[2:37:53] stuff with these Waterhead
[2:37:56] haircuts he's talking about Miss Jackie
[2:37:59] he said I never seen such a thing in all
[2:38:01] my life the other day there was a woman
[2:38:03] com up in the store where I was waiting
[2:38:04] for my wife that woman's head was that
[2:38:06] big she had green paint under her eyes I
[2:38:09] said go back Boogeyman I'll be good
[2:38:20] brother brandom said some mighty funny
[2:38:22] things in this sermon you should hear it
[2:38:23] marriage of the lamb in fact a few times
[2:38:26] he'd have to sayi not telling
[2:38:29] jokes but that's pretty
[2:38:31] funny go back Boogeyman I'll be good it
[2:38:35] was awless sight it would scare you I
[2:38:38] I've been scared
[2:38:40] myself first lady it's the first lady
[2:38:42] that's it and they take an example by
[2:38:46] that let me say this now I didn't say it
[2:38:48] jokingly being but par now he's not
[2:38:50] talking about the first lady of a church
[2:38:51] but it matters it matters how she
[2:38:54] dresses it matters how she lives he's
[2:38:57] talking about the first lady of a Nation
[2:38:59] he said you'd see that's exactly what
[2:39:01] you older Christians are doing for these
[2:39:02] younger you're supposed to
[2:39:07] be let's say that again you're supposed
[2:39:09] to be
[2:39:11] examples when you start seeing the old
[2:39:14] women think they've got to put on the
[2:39:16] paint and the powder I saw old
[2:39:21] women when I was sitting in Tennessee a
[2:39:23] few weeks ago I saw
[2:39:26] Grandma that didn't e
[2:39:29] it Lord have mercy those sweet round
[2:39:32] faces of an Old Saint an old grandma
[2:39:35] that's fought the fight and kept the
[2:39:38] faith and come down to the end of her
[2:39:40] life and now all of a sudden she feels
[2:39:43] like she's got to pain
[2:39:46] up what a sad shame that's right it is
[2:39:51] what a shame it
[2:39:53] is so the consultants and so forth and
[2:39:56] go on where are we you Pentecostals who
[2:39:59] profess to have the Holy Ghost you're to
[2:40:00] be an example for the Methodist Baptist
[2:40:02] Presbyterians not like the vers lady but
[2:40:04] like
[2:40:06] Jesus You're supposed to be he tells you
[2:40:08] in here what to do how to do it we must
[2:40:10] follow his rules and examples but that's
[2:40:12] the way we find
[2:40:13] eser what a hero she really was right he
[2:40:17] said this queen she wouldn't listen to
[2:40:18] it she wouldn't come she humiliated him
[2:40:20] if this first lady of the land sets an
[2:40:22] example like that all the rest of the
[2:40:24] ren will do it so when a man calls for
[2:40:26] his wife she'll say go jump in the
[2:40:34] river see boy he really foretold America
[2:40:37] didn't he he said now we find out that
[2:40:40] in doing so there was a man that had
[2:40:41] some wisdom about him come up and
[2:40:43] counsel the king he said the thing to do
[2:40:44] is excommunicate her send her out
[2:40:46] through the nation and call in The
[2:40:48] Virgins the young virgins and there pick
[2:40:50] yourself a wife I remember this was a
[2:40:53] Persian
[2:40:55] king this this wasn't a Jewish King this
[2:40:58] wasn't a Hebrew king this was a pagan
[2:41:01] King Persians and mes it pleased the
[2:41:05] king I guess it did so he sent out the
[2:41:08] chambermaids and I believe that's
[2:41:09] chamberlains and so forth pick all the
[2:41:12] young virgins that could the beautiful
[2:41:14] women throughout all the kingdom the
[2:41:15] provinces that he was over which was the
[2:41:17] greatest in the world and when she did
[2:41:19] it come to a little Jewish girl she's
[2:41:21] rather a kind of an offcast that's how I
[2:41:23] saw her she wasn't very beautiful when I
[2:41:26] first saw her in the spirit in a symbol
[2:41:28] in a vision she wasn't all that pretty
[2:41:31] but oh my when you're
[2:41:35] saturated in the glory when you are
[2:41:38] saturated by the glory of God there is a
[2:41:40] beauty that comes out of you that you'd
[2:41:42] never possess before because it's him
[2:41:44] making you to be beautiful hello she's
[2:41:47] kind of an O cast like the Gentiles you
[2:41:49] see cast off to one side she had no
[2:41:51] father and mother and Mori her uncle was
[2:41:53] Raising her and she had to go to qualify
[2:41:55] we know it was a cousin he's already
[2:41:57] said that earlier that she was the
[2:41:59] daughter of his uncle and so what did
[2:42:02] they they they had to take these girls
[2:42:03] in for purification many months had to
[2:42:05] perfume them do all kinds of adorning
[2:42:07] fix them all up so they could go before
[2:42:09] the king now that's just about the way
[2:42:12] the world wants to fix the church are
[2:42:14] you still with me I know it's long I
[2:42:15] don't usually to read them this long
[2:42:17] this's a long one he said that's the way
[2:42:18] the want to CH Adorn it with the world
[2:42:20] pattern after the things trying to get
[2:42:22] more members taking it in anything in
[2:42:24] their
[2:42:25] Fellowship my it's a pitiful thing one
[2:42:28] organization trying to beat the other
[2:42:30] one take anything in for a member you
[2:42:32] might take them in this organization but
[2:42:34] they'll never come into the fellowship
[2:42:36] of Christ until they're cleaned up and
[2:42:38] born again in the spirit of God
[2:42:42] woo they might have their name on the
[2:42:44] book here but not up
[2:42:45] there on the Lamb's Book of Life till
[2:42:48] it's wrote with the blood of the Lord
[2:42:50] Jesus how many of you appreciate that
[2:42:51] kind of preaching I do he said all the
[2:42:53] women they fix themselves all up look
[2:42:54] pretty oh I imagine they got really some
[2:42:56] looks on them maybe the first lady and
[2:42:58] so forth they got themselves all fixed
[2:43:00] up because they was going to appear
[2:43:02] before the king I think that's about the
[2:43:05] whole lot is getting the matter with our
[2:43:07] churches today they're trying to fix
[2:43:08] themselves up worldly having worldly
[2:43:10] entertainment worldly things in it doing
[2:43:12] things of the world associating in the
[2:43:14] world thinking they can meet the king
[2:43:16] God don't care about that he hates that
[2:43:19] but we want
[2:43:20] to we want to act like the world some of
[2:43:23] our churches I've said they've let down
[2:43:24] the bars taking in deacons and so forth
[2:43:27] in the church and sometimes
[2:43:30] pastors that's married four or five
[2:43:37] times some of them smoke cigarette he
[2:43:39] said they'll they'll get over it they'll
[2:43:42] be all right get a man out of a barroom
[2:43:44] one night and put him in the pull pit
[2:43:45] the next night I don't believe in no
[2:43:47] such stuff I believe a man is got to be
[2:43:49] proved that's right proved I tell you A
[2:43:51] lot of times we we call a lot of times
[2:43:54] we call he said I believe in the baptism
[2:43:57] of the Holy Ghost I believe in speaking
[2:43:59] in tongues but I think we lay too much
[2:44:01] emphasis on that a man can speak with
[2:44:04] tongues and a woman speak with tongues
[2:44:05] and if her life and his life doesn't
[2:44:07] compare with what tongues you're
[2:44:09] speaking in then it's the wrong tongue
[2:44:12] CA the holy
[2:44:14] spirit will make you act like the Bible
[2:44:20] you're going to argue with me over some
[2:44:21] little trinket you want to wear the holy
[2:44:24] spirit will make you act like the Bible
[2:44:26] it'll bring you to the fullness of the
[2:44:29] stature of Christ when it was her turn
[2:44:31] to go in before the
[2:44:32] king we read this in 21718 and the King
[2:44:38] loved
[2:44:40] Esther above all the
[2:44:43] women oh my some of them come dancing
[2:44:46] like a alleycat
[2:44:51] can you
[2:44:53] imagine can you imagine how some of them
[2:44:56] come slithering in like snakes to
[2:45:00] capture the king's attention she just
[2:45:03] walks
[2:45:05] in she didn't need all that
[2:45:09] crud she didn't need spiders on her
[2:45:13] eyelids she just was Meek and humble
[2:45:16] beautiful oh beautiful
[2:45:20] lot of you Brothers Here fell in love
[2:45:23] with beautiful women who didn't look
[2:45:25] like the
[2:45:27] world don't you let them start looking
[2:45:29] like the world
[2:45:35] now and don't you sorry thing turn your
[2:45:39] head to look at one of this world's
[2:45:44] hag while your Godly wife is standing
[2:45:47] beside you if You Do Your Dirty Dog you
[2:45:51] tell them I said
[2:45:53] so cuz you can't expect her to be one
[2:45:56] way and then turn your head to watch
[2:45:58] some splitt tail gal walk down through
[2:46:03] the you make up your mind I'm not
[2:46:08] looking I'm not
[2:46:11] looking perhaps one of the reasons why
[2:46:13] some want to go out there to find their
[2:46:16] companion because if you're not fully
[2:46:19] Sanctified those are the thing a a tight
[2:46:21] pair of jeans with a little honey
[2:46:23] showing is the kind of thing that a
[2:46:25] young man will find attractive if he's
[2:46:29] not filled with enough of the Holy
[2:46:36] Ghost it's not right for you to expect
[2:46:40] your wife and then you turn and look at
[2:46:43] somebody El don't you dare do it I hope
[2:46:47] I hope she pops you
[2:46:51] oh the pastor's exciting
[2:46:53] violence I do I hope she kicks you where
[2:46:56] it
[2:46:58] counts that's
[2:47:02] wrong Amen
[2:47:04] brother am it was it was she caught your
[2:47:10] attention she was the prettiest thing
[2:47:12] you'd ever seen and many of you she
[2:47:15] wasn't painted and she wasn't in tight
[2:47:18] jeans and she wasn't looking like you
[2:47:21] saw that dress you you saw that hair you
[2:47:25] you you thought everything about her was
[2:47:27] the most wonderful thing now don't you
[2:47:29] try to make her anything other than
[2:47:33] that the king loved Esther above all the
[2:47:36] women and she obtained grace and favor
[2:47:38] in his sight more than all the virgins
[2:47:40] so that he set the Royal
[2:47:44] Crown upon her
[2:47:46] head and made her Queen
[2:47:50] instead of
[2:47:52] vashy then the king made a great feast
[2:47:55] unto all his princes and servants even
[2:47:57] Esther's feast and he made release to
[2:48:00] the provinces and gave gifts according
[2:48:02] to the state of the king she was chosen
[2:48:04] why not because she was more intelligent
[2:48:07] or even more physically beautiful than
[2:48:09] the rest she was chosen because she
[2:48:11] pleased the king she found out what he
[2:48:16] loved and that's how she went in
[2:48:19] she found out he wasn't for feisty women
[2:48:23] so she went in with who she was humble
[2:48:25] me
[2:48:27] hello she investigated as Believers it's
[2:48:31] imperative that we find out what pleases
[2:48:34] the king what he desires we need a
[2:48:36] Chamberlain we need a pastor we need a
[2:48:39] teacher we need a Ministry who is
[2:48:42] surrender to the influence and
[2:48:44] Leadership of the Holy Ghost we need the
[2:48:46] Holy Ghost in our own lives as
[2:48:48] individuals to witness to us the truth
[2:48:51] of what pleases our King the best way to
[2:48:54] discover what the king wants along with
[2:48:56] his likes and dislikes is to read the
[2:48:58] word of God it is his love
[2:49:01] letter to us people who try to get away
[2:49:05] with as much carnality and worldliness
[2:49:06] as they can have simply never fallen in
[2:49:09] love with our bridegroom King those who
[2:49:12] embrace the fads and Fashions of our
[2:49:14] secular society are undoubtedly pursuing
[2:49:16] Another Love and and it is not the love
[2:49:19] of the Lord Jesus Christ one more quote
[2:49:23] and we're going to
[2:49:25] stop because I don't have time to finish
[2:49:27] the story but Tuesday night if you come
[2:49:29] I will because some Terrible Things
[2:49:32] begin to
[2:49:34] happen hymon there's a villain in every
[2:49:37] love
[2:49:39] story and hmon he shows up and he hates
[2:49:43] the
[2:49:45] Jews he was he was born of an amalekite
[2:49:50] and he hated the sight of Mori a dirty
[2:49:53] stinking Jew sitting at the Gate of the
[2:49:55] king but that's where he sat because his
[2:49:58] his cousin his little daughter the one
[2:50:01] he raised as a daughter was inside that
[2:50:03] Palace and he was going to make sure she
[2:50:05] was all right so he made his spot right
[2:50:07] outside the gate if she needs me I'll be
[2:50:10] here boy I could really get emotional
[2:50:12] this is a story of
[2:50:14] stories if she needs me I'll be right
[2:50:17] here and one day he needed
[2:50:22] her he made enemies just being a
[2:50:27] Jew and there was a decree made that all
[2:50:30] the Jews in the
[2:50:31] land not only the Royal City of shushan
[2:50:34] but in the land of
[2:50:36] all the Dominion of King haueris that
[2:50:39] all the Jews would
[2:50:42] die it had been 30
[2:50:44] days since Esther had had an audience
[2:50:47] with the can you imagine 30 days had
[2:50:49] gone by and the King had not called for
[2:50:51] her to come to his bed
[2:50:54] chamber can you imagine the
[2:50:57] doubt that was running through her mind
[2:51:00] has he fallen out of love with
[2:51:03] me as quickly as he fell in love with
[2:51:06] me 30 days have gone by and he has not
[2:51:11] called and Mori has to catch a hold of
[2:51:13] her and say you got to go
[2:51:15] anyway she said you know it's death you
[2:51:18] know that it's death if I go to the king
[2:51:21] without him bidding me to
[2:51:23] come this is protocol we don't
[2:51:27] understand she said you know it could
[2:51:29] been the end of my life and that's when
[2:51:32] he said to
[2:51:33] her for such a time is
[2:51:38] this how do we know it could be that God
[2:51:43] has brought you to the
[2:51:45] kingdom for such a time as this
[2:51:49] and she went in she knocked on the door
[2:51:51] she opened the door of what could have
[2:51:53] been the last few seconds of her
[2:51:58] life and he could have easily said get
[2:52:00] out of here and don't ever appear before
[2:52:02] me again but he did not did he he held
[2:52:05] out his
[2:52:07] scepter and she went in and nailed and
[2:52:09] just reached up and
[2:52:11] touched the tip of his
[2:52:15] scepter he said I have a request
[2:52:19] he said anything you want I'll give it
[2:52:21] to
[2:52:23] you her being at the right place at the
[2:52:26] right time and being what the king
[2:52:29] desired her to
[2:52:31] be brought
[2:52:34] Deliverance she risked her own
[2:52:38] life she saved not only the life of her
[2:52:42] uncle but the life of her
[2:52:45] people there are Jews alive today
[2:52:49] because of the courage of an
[2:52:54] eser who was
[2:52:58] willing to wait for the favor of the
[2:53:03] king when they made a movie sometime
[2:53:06] back about one night with the
[2:53:09] king the question was
[2:53:12] asked in the Prelude of the
[2:53:15] movie can one night with the King make a
[2:53:20] difference it made all the difference in
[2:53:23] the
[2:53:25] world if she would have went in there
[2:53:27] smacking her
[2:53:30] gum twisting her
[2:53:33] tail I think he would have spit and
[2:53:35] throwed her
[2:53:37] out she didn't she went in like a
[2:53:40] lady and found favor in his
[2:53:46] side in the marriage of the Lamb same
[2:53:49] sermon musicians are coming I have four
[2:53:52] three or four paragraphs yet I want to
[2:53:54] read
[2:54:06] this I told you that brother brandham
[2:54:09] didn't refer to and that's because he
[2:54:12] didn't use the word pertaineth but I
[2:54:15] found that he used the word pertain here
[2:54:19] when we were studying Deuteronomy
[2:54:21] 22:5 he said lot of the Pentecostal
[2:54:24] women were in clothed that pertained to
[2:54:25] a man and God said it's an abomination
[2:54:27] in his sight that's right how you expect
[2:54:30] to go to heaven like that it shows the
[2:54:32] Holy Spirit isn't in there if the Holy
[2:54:35] Spirit was in there it would condemn you
[2:54:38] how many of you understand that if the
[2:54:39] Holy Spirit was there he can't bear
[2:54:41] witness to something that's against the
[2:54:44] word and I showed you I showed you I
[2:54:47] didn't just tell you believe what I
[2:54:49] believe I showed you in the word where
[2:54:52] it was wrong he said oh you might shout
[2:54:54] speak with tongues run up and down dance
[2:54:56] in the spirit said I've seen Hindus do
[2:54:58] that and Indians and everything else
[2:55:00] that don't mean nothing unless unless
[2:55:03] there's a life to back up what you're
[2:55:05] talking about power of the Holy Ghost to
[2:55:08] make Godly living people he said that's
[2:55:12] the bride of
[2:55:14] Christ he said Esther was to become a
[2:55:17] bride so she did didn't want none of the
[2:55:19] adorning of the world she wanted to go
[2:55:21] into the king just like she was she
[2:55:24] adorned them like the Pentecostal women
[2:55:26] ought to with a
[2:55:29] Meek humble
[2:55:31] spirit that doesn't mean to lay down so
[2:55:34] your husband can walk all over you if he
[2:55:36] loved you he's not Desiring to walk all
[2:55:39] over you he's Desiring to give his
[2:55:42] entire life if that's what's required of
[2:55:44] him for
[2:55:46] you and when all these fancy first
[2:55:48] ladies come by with all their new
[2:55:50] fandangle things the king looked at them
[2:55:52] and put them in the chamber with the
[2:55:57] concubines these were the fair virgins
[2:55:59] of the land he sent them out to where
[2:56:00] the prostitutes
[2:56:02] were he looked at them about the same
[2:56:05] way
[2:56:07] cheap they were cheap to him but when
[2:56:10] this Esther come into His sight and he
[2:56:12] got a glimpse of that sweet humble Meek
[2:56:14] Spirit he said that's her go get the
[2:56:17] crown
[2:56:19] go get the
[2:56:21] crown and put it on her
[2:56:24] head that's
[2:56:26] right let them Adorn themselves with
[2:56:29] that kind of spirit not only the women
[2:56:31] but the men
[2:56:33] too Adorn themselves with that kind of a
[2:56:36] spirit then you're becoming ready the
[2:56:39] bride sweet
[2:56:41] reverent Esther made her heart clean
[2:56:49] Above All
[2:56:51] Else guard your heart let's
[2:57:02] stand
[2:57:06] Jesus Lord I I thank you for a
[2:57:12] people who have sold
[2:57:15] out who have surrendered their lives
[2:57:19] to want to please
[2:57:22] you Lord sometimes along the way we lose
[2:57:26] sight of what you're really
[2:57:28] after and we start thinking more or less
[2:57:32] of how we can fit in the world around
[2:57:37] us but you didn't call us to fit
[2:57:41] in in fact you called us to stand
[2:57:45] out you called us to
[2:57:49] even be gazed at and looked at
[2:57:52] misunderstood and sometimes
[2:57:55] criticized and yet you told us that at
[2:57:58] the end of this thing those who have
[2:58:00] criticized those who have
[2:58:02] misunderstood those who have condemned
[2:58:04] would come and ask for our
[2:58:08] help if we would remain faithful and
[2:58:11] true Lord I Thank you for every Godly
[2:58:14] sister I thank you for every godly man
[2:58:17] in this house and those streaming the
[2:58:21] service Lord I Thank you that you have
[2:58:24] made provision for those of us who might
[2:58:27] have lost our
[2:58:29] way you're still
[2:58:31] drawing at the end of the day the things
[2:58:34] that we have mentioned the Holiness the
[2:58:36] standard that we have talked about that
[2:58:38] is not the ultimate
[2:58:40] goal if it were then that would make us
[2:58:43] all what you would desire for us to be
[2:58:45] if we got the uniform right we would all
[2:58:47] be pleasing in your sight but the
[2:58:50] reality is it wasn't what Esther
[2:58:53] wore it was who Esther
[2:58:56] was it was in fact the reality that she
[2:59:00] didn't have to put on the
[2:59:02] world but she just came in the beauty
[2:59:05] that you had given her that which you
[2:59:07] had bestowed upon her a Meek and sweet
[2:59:09] and kind and gentle Spirit she didn't
[2:59:13] stomp in with combat
[2:59:16] boots or Slither in in with the
[2:59:18] seductive Spirit of the
[2:59:20] world she humbly walked
[2:59:23] in and she walked out of there wearing
[2:59:26] the king's
[2:59:27] crown Lord I Thank you for every person
[2:59:30] under the sound of my voice that has
[2:59:32] made such a commitment I pray for those
[2:59:36] that have found themselves this morning
[2:59:38] with a little bit of this and a little
[2:59:40] bit of that creeping
[2:59:42] in I know some don't understand my fogy
[2:59:46] ways but the reality is I've lived now
[2:59:49] long enough to watch the
[2:59:52] trend a little compromise
[2:59:55] here a little adjustment here and the
[2:59:58] next thing you know the world has
[3:00:00] stepped right Among
[3:00:02] Us and there's nothing that we can do to
[3:00:05] stop the
[3:00:06] sand from flying out of The
[3:00:09] Hourglass Lord I ask today that you
[3:00:12] would strengthen those who have made
[3:00:14] such a stand to be pleasing in your
[3:00:16] sight
[3:00:18] I thank you that you didn't leave us
[3:00:19] here without a manual you gave us your
[3:00:22] word you showed us in that book what you
[3:00:26] desired it was not our
[3:00:28] sacrifices it was our obedience that you
[3:00:31] were looking
[3:00:32] for you desire a broken and contrite
[3:00:36] spirit humble and meek no Hess no
[3:00:39] arrogance No
[3:00:41] self-righteousness in fact no judgment
[3:00:43] for anybody else I must have a madeup
[3:00:47] mind to live it
[3:00:49] you must have a madeup mind to live it
[3:00:51] Lord that's how you've left it it's it's
[3:00:54] it's the
[3:00:56] individual we can't focus on rules and
[3:00:58] regulations we have to focus on
[3:01:01] relationship the closer we get to you
[3:01:04] the less like this world we want to be
[3:01:07] and the less attraction we have to the
[3:01:11] Trinkets and Treasures that the world
[3:01:14] values Lord more than anything else we
[3:01:18] want to spend time with
[3:01:19] you we want a night with the King we
