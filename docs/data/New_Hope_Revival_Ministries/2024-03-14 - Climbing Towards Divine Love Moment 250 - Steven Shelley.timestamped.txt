[0:00] you're not standing in line with a cup
[0:02] hoping the Lord will give you more
[0:04] godliness you're going to have to be
[0:07] birthed from virtue to Virtue it's a
[0:10] climbing
[0:12] Expedition we're moving up into the
[0:15] stature of the fullness of Christ the
[0:18] stature of the perfect man and in order
[0:20] to do that it's a squeeze yes now
[0:24] anybody in this room that's ever given
[0:27] birth or ever watched a birth will will
[0:30] tell you there is no Deliverance there
[0:33] is no birth without a
[0:37] squeeze it's a
[0:39] contraction and when this little bride
[0:42] is contracted is squeezed from one of
[0:45] these virtues to the next to the next to
[0:48] the next to the next it's still not
[0:52] enough because we come up to the top and
[0:56] we're still missing
[0:58] something we have G godliness and then
[1:01] brotherly kindness and we are still
[1:03] missing something we've got to have the
[1:06] Holy Spirit to come and cap us to get
[1:10] ready to receive the
[1:12] headstone yes the holy spirit is in the
[1:16] Gap the holy spirit is wrot at the top
[1:20] and then comes the headstone or the
[1:23] Capstone and the Capstone is Love The
[1:26] Headstone is perfect love the top is of
[1:30] the pyramid it's kept with Divine
[1:35] love you can't demonstrate the fullness
[1:38] of mature love divine love perfect love
[1:41] until you have moved from one virtue up
[1:44] to the next virtue to the next virtue to
[1:47] the next
[1:48] virtue we're now Reaching Forward for
[1:51] the final baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:55] which is one that doesn't come with
[1:57] emotion or
[1:58] feeling it comes with perfection and
[2:04] completion and it's not coming that seal
[2:07] of the Holy Ghost is not coming until
[2:10] the conductor opens up and inspects the
[2:15] car you hear what he said there's a
[2:20] manifest there's an invoice on the train
[2:23] car and everything that's on there add
[2:27] to your faith virtue come on it's it's
[2:30] all written there on the on the
[2:32] Manifest it's all written there on the
[2:35] invoice and if that conductor comes
[2:37] along and see something missing he will
[2:39] not seal the
[2:41] cart once he seals that car and writes
[2:45] the destination on the seal it can't be
[2:48] open
[2:50] anymore until it reaches its
[2:53] destination so there is something yet
[2:55] the bride is reaching for so we're
[2:58] asking the Lord Lord whatever it
[3:01] takes I know it sounds like a foolish
[3:04] prayer but it's the only prayer I can
[3:07] think of that's going to get us where we
[3:09] need to be whatever it takes Lord to
[3:13] move me from Faith to
[3:15] Virtue whatever it takes Lord to move me
[3:19] up into that
[3:21] kindness to move me through that
[3:24] godliness where brother brandom said
[3:26] it's just like God so that the Holy
[3:28] Ghost can come sit on top of this little
[3:31] bride and called the
[3:33] Capstone and here it comes Hallelujah
[3:37] here it comes Zechariah prophesied here
[3:39] it comes not with shouts of
[3:43] Grace Church age Grace is not going to
[3:46] put this Bride In The
[3:48] Rapture the grace that God extended to
[3:51] the church ages is not enough to get
[3:54] this little bride out of here it's going
[3:57] to take brid Grace it's going to take
[3:59] zechariah's double Grace the Capstone
[4:02] comes with shouts of Grace Grace which
[4:06] is perfecting Grace it's completion
[4:09] Grace I don't intend to go down I don't
[4:13] intend to fail I don't intend to quit I
[4:17] don't intend to give
[4:19] up I'm not turning around I'm holding on
[4:23] I'm pressing through I'm going to win
[4:27] this thing not by my own
[4:31] strength but by his grace and I don't
[4:34] want to Discount your battle but I want
[4:37] to tell you the devil who tells you
[4:38] you're the only one is lying to
[4:42] you this little bride from from from
[4:45] Africa to Europe to the Asia to the
[4:49] Philippines to the United States to
[4:52] South America to Canada wherever she is
[4:56] she's fighting the same battle it's the
[4:59] the greatest battle that has ever been
[5:02] fought it's in the Battlefield of the
[5:05] Mind and you can
[5:07] win you can shut the liar down come on

[5:21] in your
[5:25] life
