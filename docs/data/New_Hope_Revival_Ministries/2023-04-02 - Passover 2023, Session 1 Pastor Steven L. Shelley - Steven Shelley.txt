Description:
"And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am. 2 And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of. 3 And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him. 4 Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off." Genesis 22:1-4 (KJVS)

and the techs start coming early this morning what are we going to do and I said we're going to feed the guests how I don't know but we're going to do it and uh the the weather just started moving

to see the children playing and the young people playing and the adults around the tables fellowshipping this is so much strength to me this is this is such a privilege that God has given us to be able to do that and uh my heart is full tonight I can't even completely describe what I'm feeling but I'm so grateful to the Lord and my brother Josh is going to sing a song in the morning I think and we're looking forward to that and nobody else turned in a song so I will seize the moment [Music] foreign Crown was great but she knew he had to reach him [Music] for it was her last hope of ever be

for the reading of God's word and aren't you grateful for these musicians worship leading [Applause] did anybody see the social media post where Joshua is the host of our new podcast well he did an amazing job a phenomenal job and I was more nervous than he was I've only been interviewed thousands of times but not never by my son and I was just so thankful that as we got started he had read the testimony book finally it took him his whole life and he said I read write the vision last night Dad and so he he had some amazing questions and we found out that two hours of conversation wasn't enough so we'll have to do it again and he's going to interview some of you so you better be getting your testimony together and your ducks in a row because we want to share with people around the world that we're serving a God who is just as good and just as real and just as powerful today as he always was he hasn't lost his power he's doing today what he's always done this time he's doing it in his many membered body through his many membered body would you turn in your Bible this evening and I'm I'm serious when I ask you if you've got your Bible with you tonight I know that's a rare thing would you get it and hold it in your hand and uh I I like to have my Bible with me because I like to I like to remember where something is on the page sometimes I can't remember the address but I can remember where where it is on the page so I I have another way of remembering I like to Mark in my Bible I came from strict Holiness and uh they didn't believe in marking in their Bible some of the folks that I went to church with they didn't believe in in marking in their Bible I'm so glad I got delivered from that because I locked a mark in mind I don't believe it offends the Lord I like to Mark mine so I can go back and read it again and you know sometimes when I'm marking in it I'm thinking what are these days I'm not going to be here to read this if Jesus tarries but somebody's going to read what this scripture meant to me and may it have the same effect on them so so don't give away or get rid of your your paperback Bible hold on to that it's nice to have and I say paperback is written on paper and maybe you're maybe your cover's a little fancier than that I I want you to know tonight that I had another another lesson or two plan for this weekend and in the night last night the Lord visited me in a relatively I would say profound way I'm thankful for that and he changed my mind and he put me in a spin because I didn't know if I could pull it together in time but we'll just see what the Lord will do Genesis chapter 22 is where we're going to begin this evening and we're going to read the first four verses The Book of Genesis in Hebrew is barashit and bearish sheep in Hebrew means Beginnings it is the book of beginnings brother Branham said that Satan hates the first book of the Bible and the last book of the Bible above all the rest I believe he hates it all but his origin is told in Genesis and his demise is revealed in Revelation if he did you know if he can confuse you in the Garden of Eden he can confuse you all the way through if you can't get an understanding of how sin started in the first place you won't understand how precious it is that he shed his own blood had to be blood you can't get blood out of a turnip that's what Cain found out it had to be blood it had to be Lamb's blood amen a verse 1 and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt or test Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am I want you to know tonight church that's a good answer Lord calls to you your answer ought to be yes Lord here I am I'm listening I want to obey you and the Lord said take now thy son thine only son isak Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moria are we pronounce it in English Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering in Hebrew that is hola and that word Ola means literally to be completely consumed by fire it is the root word for Holocaust it was a great burning that took place this Holocaust I want you to notice while you're standing tonight that Abraham was not only called to come and slay his son but he was called to do something that the Jews were commanded not to do in the sense they believed that the physical body is sacred and to burn the body or to cremate the body is considered Pagan and Heathen to the Jewish people and so it was a lamb or it was a bullock or it was some other animal life that was to be offered on the altar as an Ola as a burnt offering never a human being but now God in tempting and testing Abraham said take now thy son thine only son leaving leaving Ishmael out of the picture altogether whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of now I want you to know God doesn't download all the instructions at one time so if you're waiting on the download to come with the rest of your life written down but he'll give you the next step and if you'll take that step well I felt that if you'll take that next step he'll give you the next step and the next and the next and he rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him he just told him the region of Moriah or Moriah which is a it's a huge range of mountains that that have various names today one of which is mount scopus in Jerusalem if you're there and you might be interested to know that Golgotha or Calvary was also a part of Moriah or the same mountain range of Moriah Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him just servant boys and Isaac his son Enclave the wood for the burnt offering so I want you to notice that Isaac is packing the wood that's going to be used to burn his body I want you to see him climbing up the hill with that load of wood on his back the precious son of a loving father because some 4 000 years later scene is going to be repeated again and not only repeat it again but on the same Mountain at the very same spot another son is going to carry another stack of wood up a hill and his life is going to be given he rose up and went unto the place which God had told him now verse 4. then on the third day this is always very significant when we read about the third day then on the third day Abraham I want you to hear this we're going to look at this in just a moment in Hebrew and it's going to say something to you that it won't say to you in English then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place read it for me afar off verse 5. and Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and I am the land will go Yonder and worship and come again to you may God add his Blessing on the reading of his word you may be seated this evening I know I always ask for your attention sometimes when it's just the local church I demand it but it's not because I think I'm so special but I want you to know the word that I'm bringing to you tonight is life it's the most valuable this book testifies of the most valuable possession that any man could ever accept into his life The Living Word of God we're not worshiping a book we're not making a God out of a book but we're understanding that that book preserves the written record of who God is who he was what he did what he will do what he's doing now it is according to the Apostle John in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God and the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us not taking away from the father but reflecting to us the Father the Son was the perfect image of the father can you say Amen Jesus Yeshua said when you have seen me you you pray to see the father you always want to see the father I'm standing in the midst of you you don't even know who I am you don't even recognize that when you've seen me you have seen the father Abraham was given in those few verses of scripture a divine revelation from God offer you'd suck Isaac your only son as an offering to God not just an offering you're not just going to slay him you're not just gonna let him bleed out but you're going to set him on fire on this mountain I want you to understand this is serious business here this is life or death and we mean that literally Abraham had to know he had to really believe in this God that's talking to him sometimes the Lord tells somebody to put a five dollar bill in an offering and they struggle with it and want to pray about it I'm not taking an offering but they want to pray about him fast about it let me fast a while let me pray a while let me see if I can get rid of that five dollar bill what if the Lord were to come and say now I want you to move out of your house and I want you to give it to so and so or what if God were to say you know your brother could use a a Dependable way to get around but Lord I'm still making payments on mine and the Lord says what if he were to say and you still can but I want you to give that automobile to your brother oh it's quiet I'm not prophesying to you oh somebody said don't let him look at me don't let him look at me you know better than that I'm not going to tell you to do something like that but what if your papa did what if your Ava God did I I I don't think in our minds that we can hardly relate to this story because we are not in any way expecting that God would tell us that we should sacrifice the life of our own son but as the songwriter said I dare to say that most of us have an Isaac standing in our way something that we hold on to something that we treasure something that we love above other things and what would we do if God were to come by and he were to say it's it's over it's over you've got to give him to me you've got to give her to me you've got to give the job to me what if you loved where you lived and all of a sudden God said I want you to pack up and go halfway across the country what if it were a place like like Alabama like Georgia like red clay who can love this Red Dirt I do not because it's my favorite stuff there are plenty I've been all over the world and over 65 countries I think the last time I tried to add them up at least 60 and I know that I have seen some beautiful places but God doesn't always call us to the places that are the most beautiful but you better know that if he slips by your way and says I'm thinking about Hawk back there he's from the one of the most beautiful places in all the world is Iceland if you've never been there that's one of the most beautiful places I've ever been Norway maybe right up there with it you you've never seen maybe so much natural beauty in all your life but when the Lord comes by and said I had to work for you to do in Alabama then you're laying an Isaac on the Altar and you're saying Lord I must obey you I must follow your voice what if God comes by and a woman's got on a pair of slacks and the Lord were to say to her I'm going to take those I I want you to lay those down you know and and they're very comfortable to her and it's all she's ever known and she's grew up like that and she works like that and she's she just really believes that but what if the Lord were to come by and say I've got another life for you to live then what else could that woman do but to say Lord I'll follow you no matter what the cost what if the Lord were to pass by a woman who's used to keeping her hair as short as a man's and the Lord were to come by and say I want the glory of the Lord to be on your head reflected by your long hair would you really stand in God's presence and argue about your hair or would you just obey what the word said and keep the scissors out of your hair anybody with me tonight there's nothing that God couldn't require of any of us that wouldn't be worth the payment worth the sacrifice if God calls you to leave something behind he's got something greater for you and I want you to know Abraham had a revelation that this voice was the same voice that called him out of Earth of the counties the voice that spoke to Abraham the son of an idol maker in a pagan land in a foreign land worshiping hundreds of gods and a voice said get me up Abraham away from thy Kindred into a lamb that I will show thee and Abraham had to make a decision then to get up and follow a God that he'd never met and a God that he didn't even know his name who in this room would follow a God you didn't even know his name Abraham did went to a place he didn't even know existed stood up there in the heights of uh of a moray up in the top of the northern part of Israel looking over down over the city of shechaman and God let him look and see that beautiful land that he had never seen before and God said I'm going to give it to you and I'm going to multiply your seed well I want you to know Abraham could have took from that promise that it was all going to be easy and that all the inhabitants of the land were going to bow down and and you know except him as their new leader vote him in as president he could have thought by God's words that everything was going to go smoothly but how many of you know it didn't indeed excuse me it didn't indeed go smoothly at all there were struggle after struggle after struggle after struggle but God gave Abraham the strength that he needed to be obedient to The Voice and now the final test we're entering in are you are you going to stay with me this evening maybe a little slow we're entering into Passover season this week we're not only entering into Passover but we're entering into a Passover that is identical on the Gregorian calendar to the Passover that brother Brandon was born in and so it follows the days of the week this year just like it did the year that brother Branham was born somehow I have to feel like there's a little bit of a significance in that so I'm watching the days today is the tenth day of Nissan or of abib if you look at the if you look at the month in the Bible it is Habib and today is the 10th day of the month which is a very important day and we'll talk about that a little bit later in our service tonight or tomorrow but as we begin to look at this Passover time and we begin to look at how God come down and move to the children of Israel out of Egyptian slavery and how they went from slavery to Sons and as God made a way where there was no way God was calling them out of Egypt but he didn't leave them to figure it out on their own I need some help he was there with them every step of the way how many of you believe that he opened up the Red Sea he opened up the Jordan River he fed them when they were hungry he gave them water when they were thirsty when the water was poisoned he gave them away to make it pure he was with them every step of the way I challenge you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to leave here with this reality tonight you will have the Lord with you every step of the way if you are following his voice if you're doing what he's telling you to do he will never leave you he will never forsake you if you don't obey him he may pull back a little bit and let you find out what it means to live in the permissive will of God but if you'll obey him if you'll say Lord I'm waiting but I'm ready I'm ready but I'm I'm waiting but I'm ready to do whatever you tell me to do I feel like the Lord is calling many of us not just a handful but many of us to a higher place of consecration brother random said we've gone as far with God as we're going to go until we're willing to pay a greater price some of you are going to pay a greater price in this Supernatural year that we're living in right now but I encourage you now before it comes I encourage you now to know that he will provide he is Jehovah yah Ray he is Jehovah Jireh he is the god who will provide he will never ask anything of us that he will not provide for us he is involved in every aspect of our life that we will let him be he's a god of detail and he wants to be with you in your details can you trust him can you trust him is there anybody in this room that's ever found a reason not to trust God you say well I prayed one time and it didn't turn out the way I wanted it to turn out I want you to know we're not in charge here we're serving a sovereign-minded god who has a plan that's bigger than our plan and bigger he said I want to do for you exceeding abundantly above that which you could even are you here that which you could even ask or think so Abraham gets a direct I've got to hurry he gets a direct Revelation from God all for Isaac as a burnt offering he told him he would inform him which mountain to do this on you just head in the right direction and when you get closer I'll show you the very Mountain that I want you to go and the Bible tells us right here in verse 4 that on the third day he lifted up his eyes and when the Bible uses this kind of terminology it's Hebrew we have the English translation of it but when the Bible uses this kind of language it is to call our attention emphatically to what is going to follow you know otherwise it would have just said he glanced and that's what he saw he didn't say he glanced it didn't say he searched for it said he lifted up his eyes and I want you to know something that's some of what we're going to have to do in this hour there's a lot of things to make us heavy there's a lot of things that happen in life to weigh us down there are a lot of things that we don't understand and if we get under the depression of circumstances and we hang our head down we may miss what God's trying to show us and it may be even in this hour that the Lord is calling some of us like Abraham lift up your eyes even as the scripture said lift up your head even as the Bible tells us as that day of redemption draws nigh we lift up our head we look to the Hills from which cometh our help you may not know what your tomorrow holds but God Holds Tomorrow if you can trust God you don't have to worry about your tomorrow anybody with me some of us have been serving the lord all these years and we are still learning to lean and we are still learning to trust you interview some of these Old-Timers in this house and you ask them if it's the right thing to do to trust the Lord and they will tell you through thick through thin through good times through bad times times of plenty times of nothing it's the right thing to do to trust the Lord he'll never lead you to something wrong he'll only lead you to a closer walk with him he'll only lead you to something better for you if you'll follow him and so in verse in verse 5 genesis 22 we read we got some more Foundation to lay here before we get to where we need to go Abraham said to the young man I want you to stay here with the with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and we will come back to you now here is how we know that Abraham has a revelation because he and only he knew what was about to take place on that mountain only he knew what the instructions were these young men that were with him knew that there was going to be a sacrifice but they didn't know it was to be Isaac the only son of Abraham so when Abraham turned to them and said you all just stay here I'm going up yonder with my son we're going to worship and we're going to I and the land that's revelation I am the land somebody said he must have known that God was going to let him off the hook not so he had no idea that God was going to let him off the hook it surprised Abraham as much as it would surprise any of you to hear the voice of God tell you one thing and then keep you from doing what he told you to do but what he did know according to the New Testament was that the God who commanded that he go up on that mountain was a god of life and a god of Resurrection and Abraham went with a revelation and a persuasion that if I kill my son and if I set him on fire help me now and if there's nothing left but a pile of Ashes when I'm through I serve the god of the impossible I serve the god of the impossible give me a little more in the house I serve the god of the impossible I don't know how he's going to make it I don't know how he's going to look I don't know how he's going to do it in the resurrection but I just stood over my mother like many of you have stood over your loved ones and we say just what the Bible said here they return to dust and here they return to ashes but one of these days I don't know how God's going to do it but he's going to do it he's going to swing by that Cemetery with a new body I don't know how God's gonna do it but Abraham said I don't know how this is going to turn out but if if I indeed give my son as an Orla to God has a burnt offering to God I trust that this same God who has proven himself faithful will raise my son up again and these these boys here they may never know what happens on that mountain because in the same way they see me going off with my son I plan to come back with him brother that's faith no wonder the Bible looks over some of Abraham's mistakes no wonder the Bible said he staggered not at the promises of God even though he got involved and helped God out and and produced a a false seed by his concubine Hagar Ishmael then he had to drive him into the Wilderness and if you know anything about political or geographical or geopolitical situations in the Middle East you know that the The World Is Still reeling the world is still dealing with the sons of Ishmael that wasn't God's idea Ishmael wasn't God's idea was Abraham's idea but God loved Abraham that's what the prophet said and he allowed Abraham to have this this way this will this thought this idea then Ishmael gets old enough that he starts mocking the promised son and he had to drive him out into the Wilderness with his mother not knowing even what would happen to them out there I'm telling you if if anybody knew what it means to separate yourself from the things you love I need some help I know I'm on the trail but I still need a little help here it was Abraham but he trusted God he was a friend to God he known God I would like to think that there are some Sons some spiritual sons of Abraham in this house brother Branham said that little bride is from the Royal seed she may not all be Jews she may not all be from the natural loins of Abraham but he said she's the Royal Seed of Abraham how many of the royal Seed of Abraham is in this house tonight then no less than no last in the faith Abraham had is going to get you and I through got to have the same kind of faith all is well all is well we have heard the message Shalom all is well for there is a place of perfect rest behind the inner Veil o rest little bride rest for all is well things have not always worked out like God's people thought you see the bride is still here and we're fighting the greatest battle ever fought but we must have the faith of Abraham knowing God's word never fails just look up little bride and know that all is well let me hear you sing all is well oh everybody help us we have heard the message Shalom all is well for there is a place a perfect rest behind the inner Veil saw rest little bride rest for all is well didn't you hear what the doctor say rest little bride rest don't you know how addicted she is rest little bride rest for all is well don't you know what cancer has done to that body rest rest little bride rest for we must have the faith of Abraham knowing God's word never fails just look up and say oh all is well you've put my picture up this is one of my favorite Bible paintings I had a copy but I gave it to a friend and I don't that's the only copy I have of it now it's a little grainy but I want you to look at what we see here we see Abraham with a with a knife a sword of some sort in his hand we see a little altar that he's built and his son tied to the Altar and we see the wood stacked there and and and and and we see Abraham lifting up his eyes he's catching a glimpse of the Holy Temple if you and I can just lift up our eyes and catch a glimpse of what's waiting on us over there in eternity I believe you'll run on I believe if your spiritual eyes could be open tonight and you could catch one glimpse of that Eternal City you'd run on I believe you'd pray on and you'd read on and you'd Press On and I believe if you felt discouragement coming you'd Shake It Off and you'd say I've got to run this race I've got so much waiting for me over there the Bible said here in verse 5 and I am the lad now I want to just say this to you some of you know my studies while I was in Jerusalem on this particular subject I understand that brother Branham said that Abraham's son Isaac had had reached the age of 12. and and I don't know if that was under inspiration or if it was just his thought I don't know and I'm not going to say to you anything contrary to that because I respect and honor the office that brother Branham held but I also understand that every every detail of every story he told and and every reference that he made may or may not have been inspired and since we don't know whether it was or not we look to the word how many of you know we have to he told us to look to that word so don't you misunderstand me tonight I'm not in any way trying to take away from what brother random said but I want you to know that that word lad there it can mean more than a little boy it can mean a boy or a young man in fact it means in its in its rudiest form when you take that word lad all the way back to the bottom and the base of its root it actually means a man who is old enough to serve in the battle so I'm only saying that because as the Jews believe there is a possibility that Isaac was much older than 12 years old would somebody like to would somebody like to guess how old the Jews believe Isaac was when he went up on the mountain with his father that day anybody like to guess if you don't know 37 who said 37. you've got your notes 37 7 is there anybody in this room 37 only Michael you're 36. almost 37. come up here Michael I'm going to sacrifice you on this altar I don't know if he were I don't know how old he was I'm just telling you the word doesn't necessarily mean little boy in Hebrew and there are other words in the in the language of this story that lead the Jewish Scholars and sages to believe that he was a grown man of 37 and he had not yet met Rebecca he was not yet married now you know I'm I'm fat that was a good chance Daniel brother Daniel for you to say Mercy but he didn't want if you can't say Amen say Mercy I'm a big old man I could do a lot of damage sitting on Michael but I may not be as strong as Michael I'm feeling around on his arms and he lifts and he works and he's a strong pretty strong guy and and what I'm trying to imagine here is Abraham if indeed let's just suppose can we suppose can you streamers give me a little Mercy and let's suppose you're already on your computer trying to search out what brother Graham said couldn't you just give me a minute and let's suppose together because I just want to make a point here there had to be something between Isaac and Abraham there had to be a measure of trust so not only did Abraham trust his daddy but Isaac had to trust his daddy if he was going to carry the wood up there all up the hill and lay down I mean can you imagine they get there on the way up go sit down thank you so much can you imagine they he asked the question Dad I see the the wood but where is the sacrifice Abraham had Resurrection Faith because he told the men to remain where they were because he and Isaac were going to the mountain and both would return back to them again somebody say Abraham's faith then in Genesis 22 charity verse 6 and we'll have this picture again and or you can do that and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham's father so now it doesn't matter to me what you see now in your mind you may say who's 12 years old let me let me have a 12 year old come here little Feller what's your name said Levi that's is that right Levi that's a wonderful name you're named after your granddaddy Levi maybe and Levi in the Bible is that right your uncle all right come here and turn around Michael come back are you turning red Levi is this yours brother Isaac is this whose son is this whose son is this I forget you've got them all ages though it was your uncle I don't care in a moment when I finish reading these verses it doesn't matter to me if you see a boy Levi's age or if you see a young man Michael's age but I want you to see one of the two whichever you're more comfortable with I want you to have an image in your mind of of a boy or of a young man walking up Mount Moriah or Mount Moriah with his father Abraham how many of you can do that with me tonight thank you brother so much and and whatever age he was or whatever size he was he says to Abraham my father now father can sound like such a reverential title but because he said my father he really called him Papa the Hebrew word is ABBA and I have told you before there's nothing like being in Jerusalem on air Shabbat the day of Friday and all the Jewish people have come to the shook to the market to buy their food for Shabbat and to prepare their meal and to buy their flowers for the table and to get everything ready for Shabbat that begins at sundown and it gets very crowded there on Fridays we lost brother West there on a Friday one time it gets very very crowded and he said he was lost we were lost but but the thing is we were all lost together and he was lost by itself but we met up and that's all that matters sister West we met up that's what matters but anyway and and the crowd there and you know the Orthodox Jews have a lot of children they must be somehow kind of like the Amish they have a lot of children and uh they they take a few with them to the Shook and it's usually Daddy because mama's home busy there's nothing like the sound of the crowd those little kids going everywhere and and one once once in a while a one about two years old or three years old will get lost from his dad he doesn't really panic he just calls out Abba Abba it's amazing to me every little boy you hear a little boy and his mother went to the shop it's IMA IMA Ima you may be hearing a dozen voices saying Abba but I want you to know every daddy that has taken his little boy to the ship he knows the sound of his child's voice and the mother knows the sound of their child's voice and when they say Emma or when they say it's it's my father my Abba he's calling to him with great affection and he says Abba and Abraham said here am I that's like you looking over there and say Here I Am what do you want here am I my son and he said behold this is Isaac again I see the fire it's in your hand I see the wood it's on my back but I have a question for you ABBA doesn't matter whether he was 12 years old or 37. his question is legitimate wouldn't you say because he has been told We're Going Up To Worship we're going up to give God an offering that we call sacrifice and it's legitimate to want to know where is the Lamb where is the ram where is the Bullock where is the dove what are we going to give to God how are we going to offer him something when we we have nothing where is the Lamb for the hola for the burnt offering are you with me let's go on and Abraham said my son whoo hear this my son there's such a relationship here my son God daddy house how's God going to help us out of this mess God will I don't know how but God will my own children asked me one time how are we ever going to get out from under this and my answer to them was I don't know but I know he does and we're going to trust him and he's going to bring us out of this because that's who he is my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together I want you to notice this trusting relationship uh you know Isaac didn't say how's that going to happen dad and you know like if it was if it was tally or some of these children around here we love them but they'd ask you know they would ask oh my goodness would they ask where is tally is she in here she's not she can ask the biggest questions you've ever dealt with in your life and you you're you're torn in the middle between wanting to shut her up and remembering that that's how a child learns is to ask questions so you want to try to answer those questions but but but Isaac didn't say but Dad how is God going to give us a lamb how are we going to have a sacrifice can you give me the details he just okay it doesn't even say he said yay nay or anything just said they went together he didn't turn around and run he didn't go back down the mountain he just kept on walking are you with me all right verse 9 and they came to the place which God had told him of Moriah Mariah that's why my daughter's named Mariah because we were in Jerusalem when the lord gave us her name and told us to name her after the Holy Hill of God and there Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order as as you saw in the picture he stacked it in order and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood if it was Levi I think every one of you would believe that I had the power to over overpower I I have the strength and the girth and the size to overpower Levi I don't know he might have he might be a fighter but I don't think anybody struggles with the thought that I would be able to tie him up with the Rope folks you ain't got no confidence in me my goodness the way you people are I don't know my American British no more please help me out don't leave me here by myself but some of you are looking at Michael and you're thinking you know it might be a little harder but the Bible said he bound Isaac his son folks somebody had to let it happen Isaac had to be willing Isaac had to be yielded Isaac had to show honor and respect to his dad and to the faith of his death I want to propose to you that Isaac had some faith of his own I don't know what kind of experience he had had with the god of Abraham yet but I want you to know he trusted the relationship that he saw his dad having with the invisible God Daddy's daddies we must be living this kind of a lie so that our children have confidence in our relationship with God so that if we ever get in the situation where we can't explain why we'll be able to say because God said so and that settles it are you with me this evening so I personally like to show at least the Jewish thought okay maybe he was 12 years old but I tell you what he would have still had to have a lot of confidence in his dad to climb up on that altar I didn't see Michael jumping up here when I told him I was going to lay him on the altar I didn't see him run up there and lay down I believe there would have been a struggle under any other circumstance but but Abraham had such a faith and it was such a testimony to his family I want to say something here I want to say something here mothers and dads I want to say something to you in love if we win the whole neighborhood and lose our own children we've not really done anything for the kingdom of God a minister that will leave his family to go to the other side of the world without caring without concern without burden for what's going on in his own house and with his own children I challenge that kind of a movement and I wonder if that's Faith or Pride sometimes I think pride gets involved I want you to know there's a time to well aren't we supposed to serve God first and family later I want you to know the very first assignment that God gives to any man even before he makes him a minister of the Gospel is to be is to be a father to his children and a husband to his wife and I say that with full knowledge that I have failed mine multiple times I have failed my family I know I most certainly have done that and it's it's not out of a sense of Pride or arrogance that I would challenge you to do better it's out of my own experience that I would say to you we cannot we cannot win the neighborhood at the cost all right reach one yes we need they need us they need us I I tell you when I when I first got married I came from the Holiness thought of of really no birth control under any circumstances and that's going to get very quiet now we were almost Catholic you know and so it was no big surprise that Benjamin came along almost nine months after we right at excuse me not almost we were married in November he was born in August so it was nine months no wonder it was because we weren't doing anything to prevent it and and I think that was a good plan I'm not I'm not I don't regret that's how we live the earlier part of our life brother Branham said these things should be taken in a personal interview oh meaning this shouldn't be a Doctrine for the whole church isn't that interesting because there are different circumstances I believe that there are people on this planet that one child is all they really need to pour their life into but I believe there are others that have got so much love to give so much time and more money than they know what to do with and they ought to have a dozen or more I'm not against how they do it but here is the revelation that I came to a man and a woman do not need to have any more children than what they can afford to take care of you never say man it's a truth because it's not my place to take care of your children it's your responsibility to take care of your children and wait a minute I didn't just mean provide for their doctor bills or buy their toothbrushes or to put shoes on their feet I mean can you afford to commit to the spiritual responsibility of discipling their life because they don't raise ourselves children will raise ourselves they've got to have strong leadership in the family they've got to have a daddy that gets on his knees they've got to have a Daddy who prays Mama's prayers are wonderful but not enough Mama's not the only one to tell a Bible story Daddy's got to have that he's got to have a place I believe they should share in the discipline I don't believe that mothers ought to threaten their children when Daddy gets home [Music] I think Mother's got to straighten up Bill strong sometime too I don't believe a mother needs to do any I didn't mean to get on this I don't believe a mother needs to do anything that puts something in their children's heart that causes them to be afraid of when Daddy gets home they ought to run to the door they ought to be so excited to see Daddy they can hardly stand it are you with me because they need that they've got to trust him they've got to learn listen they learn it when when these brothers throw their children up in the air I used to be that guy but from where I am now what's wrong with you I lose my breath sometimes watching these people throw their kids up in the air but did you know that's vital did you know that's an important part of that Bond did you know that child learns they may Scream the first time I don't mean try to be a clown and throw them up on the roof of the church they learn that Daddy's going to catch them yeah you understand Mama the same she talks [Music] and we need to do that in our Christian families we need to teach our children that they can trust us that we're going to be there they are not at the mercy of this world they're not at the mercy of welfare they're not in the mercy of the government they are our responsibility and we want to be there for them and we want to be present for them it's it's a relationship that I believe Isaac and Abraham had I believe that regardless of how old he was he trusted the relationship that Abraham had with God and he trusted the relationship that Abraham and he had together he could trust his dad that everything is going to be all right and so when he when he said okay son hold still put your hands maybe right here and your feet here and lay down and daddy is going to tie you up we do not hear another utterance out of Isaac's mouth he just obeys he is at peace so having the faith of Abraham folks is not just calling those things that are not as though they are or they were but having the faith of Abraham is also the grace to be obedient to the word of God you are not an exception I don't know who I'm preaching to tonight but you are not an exception you have to live by this word and you know what is not a dread it's a joy this is the life I want to live I want you all to know I drink all the alcohol I want to drink I smoke all the cigarettes and pop all the pills hello streamers I run with all the girlfriends that I want to run with that's my relationship with him I'm living the life I want to live I don't want those things I don't need those things somebody said yeah but you're you're different let me tell you something this is what the Lord can do in your life this is the freedom we were singing about this is the freedom I'm not bound by Church rules I live the life I live because it's his life it's obedience and surrender to the will of my heavenly father nobody is forcing this life on me he is making me live like this I choose to live this life because I know that my father can be trusted I didn't have an Earthly father to trust I feel so many times like I had no father but God but could you ask for any more perfect example than our God next verse I gotta hurry it's time to go home now and then and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son I don't really believe it was that way I do I really do I believe Abraham really trusted God I'm not trying to preach for the greatest message I know that he did a section of his sermon on Abraham not too long ago while I was away I heard it was wonderful he made a statement something like this I don't know if Abraham knew well I want to tell you something he knew he knew the scripture is if you really look at the scripture you understand that he knew that he was a forerunner he was he was he was a type something that was going to follow that was going to be much greater you see God was about to come down and replace a life with a life all right he was going to show what it means to take a life and replace it with another life so that we could see and where was he going to do it right there folks it's not by happenstance that Calvary is a part of the same Mountain that Moriah is it's not by happenstance that Abraham put put Isaac up on an altar on the very Rock the very Mountain where Jesus hung and died for another son come on now let's read on just a minute stretch forth his hand and the angel of the Lord the angel of the Lord called out boy that's heavy oh dear can you see this you folks jittery I met the artist who did that he was a very kind man he's also the one who did the eagle and the and the on the world with the sword in his mouth a Jewish artist the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and how did he answer Ed the same way he answered his son here am I I'm here Lord and the angel said lay not that hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou feirest God seeing thou Hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me let's read on Abraham what did he do verses before the Bible said he lived it up his eyes and saw the place which in Hebrew is excuse me he lifted up his eyes and he saw the place now he did it again so this is a spiritual thing this is when you when you when you forget for a moment where you are and what you're going through and you choose to look up to him and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him now that phrase in the Hebrew behind him doesn't mean in the past the Greek translators chose behind him but in Hebrew it doesn't say in the past or behind him guess what it says in the Hebrew it says in the future looked and behold behind him a ram he looked in the future he looked in the future and saw a ram not in the past in the future did you all see just a minute ago how she had the words up and the picture was behind it we call that sometime superimposed this is the vision that Abraham had that day on the mountain he saw something in the spirit that was superimposed he saw a ram whose horn was caught in the fishing but he also saw something else he saw the place and the place is harmock home it means the city of God it means the Gateway of the Kingdom so Abraham wasn't just seeing his present he was seeing the future superimposed over the present he saw Jesus are you are you confident enough to say that yes I am he saw Jesus never born bethlehem's babe had never been born and yet Abraham caught a revelation let me tell you something when you can catch a revelation in the midst of all this adverse circumstance and you can catch a glimpse that everything I got a feeling everything's gonna be all right oh I've got a feeling everything's gonna be all right I've Got a Feeling everything's gonna be all right be all right be all right be all right I am I got a feeling but it's more than a feeling it's a feeling that comes from a revelation that what I'm seeing right now is pointing to something when I stood here last Sunday and talked about those five those five planets lining up I was not aware of this quote how much time do I have I know you're tired you can stand up and do jumping jacks and then sit back down if you if you need to I wouldn't care I really wouldn't care I read this to some of the brothers today because it's sometimes so hard to find some of these things we've got all these search engines and everything and it's still hard to find some because brother Brandon can say it so many different ways I didn't get to be in the services but if I would have been there I would have done my best to have kept him on track a time or two somebody said that's a Blasphemous thing to say no but I mean to be so fearful that you couldn't even help him when he was saying given the wrong scripture you think somebody I don't know how those women if if not the men I don't know how the women kept quiet I am two Sister George because I know you and I know you would have wanted to help him that's nothing wrong and you'd have wanted to say was that so-and-so because he said it I just jumped right on it because he talks here now on some very powerful things and he's calling them five stars instead of planets and so if you search for five planets you won't even find this quote so I came here with the court I had but but look at what I what I got I won't tell how I got it but it came from another Pastor in the message who happened to be streaming our service and probably wouldn't want the world to know it and he sent this through to the family through into me I mean I got it because he sent it to the family it's from the message the end times sign seed in 1962 March the 19th he said now what's happened we see a roar in the paper across the television out across the Nations where five stars just fell in line with the world he goes on now and talks for 10 minutes about it's aligning I know that that Pippin you can look it up and see that this was absolutely with the timing of the five planets that lined up just like they're lined up right now we're not at the peak anymore but they're still in alignment just after Sunset five planets lined up with the moon and and the Earth in a 50 degree uh sector or section of space he said we're five stars just fell in line with the world what's five a number of Grace every time those stars come in to me this is significant to hear every time those stars come in something happens on Earth he said what taken place five stars fell in what was it and introducing of what he said since then look just what's taken place Germany almost washed off the map some of the Magi said that the world would burst like a watermelon that was the Indian astronomers astrologist he said every distressful thing is prophesied by them for the last days look what's taken place England the other day had a storm that blowed away seventy thousand houses in one day disasters everywhere California Los Angeles nearly washed in the ocean what is it the beginning of Sorrows earthquakes has picked up everywhere why is it five stars come in lineman Grace God's grace what's happened an infant Church listen listen that's the natural he's telling us that when these things line up that way it affects things in the natural seventy thousand homes destroyed in a storm Germany flooded almost washed off into the ocean Los Angeles flooding almost washed off into the ocean but listen to this he said five stars come in line Grace God's grace what's happened an infant Church Hallelujah a bride infancy that the power of God has begun to fall on her she's taking form whoop a bride for his bridegroom for this bridegroom that three stars meant his Perfection of the heavenly father of the Trinity becoming one on earth Among Us God's offices becoming one office what happened now it's the Church of the Living God coming together under the word of God let it be so Lord and the astronomic heaven or astronomic Heaven is announcing her approach amen he said might not believe that but it's the word just the same yes sir what's happening I'm closing I might say this friends the church is coming forth God's going to have a church without spot or wrinkle she's predestinated God said so he would have it that makes it right who's a member I don't know I'm trusting it to be myself I'm trusting you I'll remember but he's going to have a body without spot or wrinkle so brother Branham in this quotation he draws the spiritual connection as well as the natural connection and he tells us that as things begin to happen naturally on the earth when these he says Stars here but planets align then he said also this spiritual this is the spiritual side that's the church coming up that's the bride being formed for her bridegroom now here we are again about to enter into Passover time I didn't say Easter Bunny time or or Easter bonnet time or what time is the Easter egg hunt going to be at the church that's a mockery wait a minute Amen brother let's read on here just a minute I've got to close where were we at up there these people have driven all day and night in their War now and I'm wearing them out and then I'm not even going to give them supper you make it to lunch tomorrow we'll feed you again and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Jehovah Jireh yeah as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen in Moriah it shall be seen come on he named it based on what he had experienced this is more than God providing around that day this is God providing a ram on another day a lamb without spot and without recalling without blemish you know what today is the 10th of Nissan or the tenth of Habib do you know what would be happening today or son has sat so we're going into the 11th but the sun is set Jesus arrived in Bethany today he's visiting in the home of Mary and Martha in Lazarus on this day Six Days on the 31st six days before Passover five days now before the Passover begins does anybody remember anything about that night we can't talk about it right now I've got to read on give me another verse I'll get to it in a minute maybe no that's all my verses there isn't it now in in in Hebrew this whole chapter of of Genesis chapter 22 is called the Akida and it means The Binding it's one of the most important scriptures in Judaism there are so many Messianic elements to this story pointing to the Future let me give you a confirmation if someone needs a confirmation would you give me John chapter 8. verse 51 do I have a few more minutes verily verily I say unto you if this is Jesus talking red letter if a man keep my saying he shall never see death then said the Jews unto him now we know that thou Hast the devil Abraham is dead and the prophets and thou sayest if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death art thou greater than our Father Abraham which is dead and the prophets are dead who make us thou thyself who are you in Jesus answer if I honor myself my honor is nothing it is my father that honoreth me of whom you say that he is your god I tell you that's powerful talk isn't it yet ye have not known him but I know him and if I should say I know him not I shall be a liar like you but I know him and keep his saying your father Abraham you see he wasn't just looking at a ram in a bush he lifted up his eyes and he saw the place he lifted up his eyes and he saw the sacrifice and Abraham went down that mountain with more faith that he had when he went up that mountain he said I may never live to see it with my with my natural eyes but today I have seen the Lord [Applause] I have seen the Lord's salvation I have seen Jehovah Yara the God who provides he not only meets our physical needs but he met our need for Redemption your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day he saw it and was glad don't you believe that's New Testament confirmation or what I was preaching you in a moment ago then said the Jews unto him Thou Art not yet 50 years old and hast thou seen Abraham didn't say he saw Abraham said Abraham saw him right Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you before Abraham was get your tenses right he didn't say I was the I was did he I will be the will be I am that I am he said before Abraham go back before Abraham was I am this blows their mind they don't know what to think then took they up stones to cast in him but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple going through the midst of them and so passed by I'll take you to the to the precipice overlooking from the city of of Nazareth where they pushed him down toward the crowd toward the the edge of the the precipice of the cliff and they were going to push him off the cliff because he said to them before Abraham was I am because he said Abraham rejoiced to see my day he saw it and was glad they were going to they call this blasphemy and they were going to push him off and you know what God just made a way like like some of you saw portrayed in the chosen God just made a way where there was no way that that here there said we're we're here to push you off and instead they just and he walks right through what the Bible say through the midst of them so passed by look what he did what did Abraham see quickly what took place on Mount Moriah Abraham was instructed by God to take Isaac to Mount Moriah and sacrifice him there did you know that first and the second temple would be built right on top of the same Hill so when we have our picture up you see Abraham seeing the Holy Temple when you are in Jerusalem if you go into the mosque of Omar if you go into the golden dome call it the abomination of desolation but it wasn't originally that it's now a holy place for Muslims and sometimes they don't even let non-muslims go in but in 1979 when I was 11 years old I went in and saw the rock I should have got a picture I'd love to I'd love it could somebody find us a picture of the inside of the Dome of the Rock put in something like that the stone or the rock inside the Dome of the Rock and there should be a picture taken from the top of the Dome looking down over the Rock the place where the Holy Temple sat right there on the mountain is the is the very place where Abraham was laid up on this altar on the Rock to be sacrificed so powerful things were going to follow God was there it is how many of you have ever seen that picture any of you that's looking down on the very Bedrock of the top of Mount Moriah so somewhere on that slab of Iraq the altar would have been built that Isaac was laid on top of hundreds of years later the first temple would be built and the second temple would be built just off the of that same escarpment of stone no longer connected today Suleiman the Magnificent blasted out a piece of of the Mountain of Moriah so that Calvary now sits on one side of the road and the Temple mount on the other side of the road but you can stand on the walls of Jerusalem and look out look on top of the walls and look out and see Calvary and you can clearly see that at one point it's the very same rock where Abraham was going to sacrifice Vice Isaac it's the same rock where the first temple was built the same rock where the second temple was built and the same rock where our Lord was crucified this is what Abraham saw in second Chronicles chapter 3 verse 1 then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem in Mount Moriah where the Lord appeared unto David his father in the place that David had prepared in the threshing floor of ornam the jebusite so here was another happening that took place right here on the mountain it was in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah where Jesus was crucified on the tree so I want you to imagine for me just just a moment in closing I want you to imagine another son carrying a piece of wood I can almost guarantee you it didn't look like a Catholic cross I can almost guarantee you that he was only caught carrying the crossbar and it wasn't a two by four it was a log I know the picture show the the whole cross but this was this didn't happen in that time period they tied them to the crossbar and they hung them on the execution stake and the execution state was like a tree and When They Carried their crossbar all the way up to the top of the hill then they attached the crossbar to the execution stake and this is how Roman crucifixion took place somebody said why does that matter it matters because you would be surprised what the Catholic church has done to change our image uh there were no altars in the in the early church those people even knew then that the altar was the heart there's so much Church entity that gets into our our this whole Easter thing so religious we make it hot cross buns ham can you imagine Easter ham such tradition not understanding that it's not just simple little tradition it's rooted in things that are against Christ paganism dressing your little children up somebody said I'm so glad I got out from under the Amish or I'm so glad I got out from under that group or the other group so now I can give my children Easter bunnies you think the Lord delivered you out of that system so he could put you in one map map Easter has absolutely nothing to do with the resurrection you hear about the brand I'm talking about Easter and every place that you hear him say Easter you could easily easily replace that with the word resurrection and the resurrection is not a day we celebrate Resurrection every day can I get some help you're afraid I'm going to preach another hour I might the resurrection is not a day what is the resurrection it's a person Jesus said I am the resurrection you don't have to wear no Easter bonnet for me you don't have to give your children diet eggs for me I don't want the goddess of fertility mentioned in mind [Music] you know why they eat the ham don't you because Nimrod was killed by a wild boar and so they celebrate and have since Pagan days they celebrate by eating ham on Easter Sunday because Nimrod was killed by a wild boar they believe that a that a bunny laid an egg just silliness isn't it does anybody know anything about rabbits they don't lay eggs and they're not pink and purple and polka dotted when if it did somebody tell me what that's got to do with the resurrection of Jesus Christ it's got about as much to do with it as a Christmas tree has to do with Christmas foreign just a minute Amen brother tell it you don't have to be popular but you've got to tell the truth because we're going to answer to God for these things one of these days [Music] for the kitties if it's for the kitties it's for the kitties you get them in a good atmosphere and teach them how to Worship the Lord you teach them how to put God first you mamas and daddies learn how to disciple your own children you want to do something for them they don't need the Easter basket you give them give them big to them and and treat them and and celebrate with them and and there's nothing wrong with that but don't reduce the holy things of God to the paganism of this old world and dress it up and try to call it religious because brother Branham preached a sermon on the true Easter seal so somebody said well there couldn't have been nothing wrong with Easter or he wouldn't have said that he's talking to the people in a language they can understand I thank God I can understand a different language than that today well that went over like a rat sandwich Hebrews 11 I'm going to close I didn't even get to mine to my subject verse 17 by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure I wasn't making it up it's in the book he was seeing into the future he was seeing harmacombe in Jeremiah 17 12 if you're making notes in Jeremiah 17 12 harmonicom is used in Hebrew as the Glorious Throne of God in the place of his sanctuary and in Genesis 28 17 that same phrase harmonic home is used as the gate it's a place where Jacob woke up and said surely the Lord is in this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the Gate of Heaven Genesis 28 17. I'm going to do this I'm going to take Liberty go to John 12 just a moment if I were sitting where you are I'd be wishing the preacher was done so I don't judge you at all people sit in front of a football game that goes on for eternity of course the reason why it takes so long is to keep falling down if they get up and get it over with it could all be done in 20 minutes people said all night for basketball goes into overtime they love these overtime games go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on hoping for a different outcome and they don't want to give God even a whole hour if you worship longer than 20 minutes say thank you you're really abusing people then Jesus listen then Jesus six days before the Passover that would have been on the 10th which was today six days before the Passover came to Bethany where Lazarus was with where last was which excuse me what switch had been dead whom he raised from the dead there they made him a supper and Martha served but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenerd very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and I've often said if the modern Pentecostal Church decided to worship this way they would beat themselves to death with their bobbed hair foreign but here a woman had long enough hair that she could wipe his feet with her hair I I can't imagine what people would say this wild woman this loose acting woman how dare her now this may have happened more than one time this anointing Jesus for burial but we know exactly where this happened it happened in Bethany not in the house of Simon not this one this happened in the house of Lazarus and Martha and Mary and it was Mary who took a pound of ointment of Spite and are very costly an anointed defeat of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the order of the ointment then saith one of his disciples guess who it was Judas Iscariot Simon's son which should betray him why was not this ointment sold for 300 Pence and given to the poor imagine the religiousness how religious it sounded so religious what kind of church would have padded pews I remember that what kind of church would have carpet on the floor I remember those days what kind of church would have indoor plumbing I remember when they said things like that religious not spiritual Judas wasn't being spiritual he couldn't care less about the poor he was manifesting his seed then he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was and had the bag and bear what was put therein then said Jesus let her alone against the day of my burying had she kept this she knows something you Fellers don't seem to know for the poor always you have with you but me you have not always much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for Jesus sake only but that they might see Lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead but the chief priest consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus can you imagine that a man is raised from the dead and the religious are going to kill him because he testifies that he once was dead and now he's alive so look for don't you be surprised when somebody has something critical to say about you they despised a man once dead now raised again they're going to despise you if you were once bound and now you're free if you were once quiet it's a church mouse but now you shout the high praises of God they're going to criticize you if you were once founding and steep by religion but now you have a real relationship with Jesus Christ they're going to criticize you six days before the Passover this is what the what the organized Church calls Holy Week is about to begin tomorrow being what the organized Church calls Palm Sunday not even really understanding the fullness of what these people were saying they were crying out for salvation laid their garments down in the palm branches in front of him fulfilling the Prophecies of the Old Testament as the very Lamb of God was riding into the town now I'm closing musicians are coming quickly Martha was serving Lazarus was fellowshipping at the table the religious Jews were standing on the outside of the house ready to kill Lazarus everybody had a purpose hear me everybody had something that was consuming their thought process I want somebody to tell me what Mary was doing what was she doing Lazarus chose to sit at the table and and fellowship Martha chose to serve the table it was her nature to be a servant and everybody doing something fulfilling some purpose and what did Mary do I'll Tell You Folks it was Passover she was choosing her lamb it is good she was choosing her lamb the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world she took the most prized possession that she had broke it broke the Box laid pour the spotner out on his feet and begins to wipe his feet with the hair of her head she chose her lamb she didn't get caught up in the politics that was going on outside the door or the religious work going on outside the door she didn't even get caught up with the dishes now folks the dishes have got to be washed but they didn't have to be washed right then I've traveled all over this country I've traveled all over the world I've eaten in probably thousands of homes you can look at me and tell foreign I've been in homes where I never saw the women never saw them they they prepared the meal and they put the meal on the table and they were gone I never saw them again I've been in I've been in pastors homes where the pastor wouldn't even eat a meal with me because he wanted to honor me I've sat in rooms with my own Companions and eaten alone and only saw the pastor before the meal and after the meal and it was a way of it was in their culture a way of showing me respect I finally told them this respect this is too much I'd rather you come in here and eat a meal with me let's eat together and then I would say to him sometime can I go back and speak to the sisters and thank them for the meal and you you think In some cultures I was asking to to kill the pet dog or something but I want to thank them for the meal I like the good food they prepared and I enjoyed all the wonderful meals but do you know what I enjoyed the most was when the sisters would come around and they'd say we can wash the dishes after you all go we just want to sit over here and listen see they were choosing their lamb there's a time to wash the dishes there's a time to put things away there's a time to get involved in what's going on outside but there is a Time folks I don't know what your culture is but maybe you ought to adjust it that's one thing I know about some of these former Amish people Sister Mary they don't mind to work these are hard-working people they know what farm work and hard work is all about but I want you to know they love to be close enough when the men folk are talking about the things of the Lord and so far I've not seen any of their husbands correct them and say now you're going off with the women because they're so hungry to hear to share the testimony not just from me I see these people going around to folks in the church talking their testimonies out this is how we grow I I hope I'm not getting myself in trouble here but the dishes can wait sometime sometime we ought to choose our lamb we ought to choose what we put our focus on brother Mary chose our lamb she said I don't care that this is all I got the only savings I have after this I have nothing of any value the most valuable thing in all the world is sitting in my living room tonight and there's trouble everywhere and there's rumors that they're going to kill him this is my chance to kneel down at his speed and pour out my costly perfume dry his feet the oil off with my hair and let him know there's no place I'd rather be there's no place I'd rather be there's no place I'd rather be than Here In Your Love here in your love oh I'd rather be right here sitting on the floor worshiping the Lord fueling the critics because we sung a little louder the drum was a little louder the guitar was a little loud or somebody kicked up their heel or somebody had a little bit of joy don't you get caught up in that choose your lamb tonight it's Passover time it's time to choose our lamb I want to choose the one that Abraham saw he saw the ram in the thicket but he saw far off he saw the place Jesus comes along and confirms it four thousand years later Abraham he saw me he saw my day and he rejoice in this word wonderful don't it fit together so beautiful sing this with me perfect the the what is the name I mean so many years so many lambs for so many years so many lambs were offered up [Music] but all the blood that was filled it could never feel this one bitter cup till one spotless lamb in the form of man gave his life on Calvary his was the only blood that could ever set men free let's worship the king for his blood was not just blood of another spotless foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] still the laws from Calvary [Music] my testimony there's no other blood that could heal my broken body [Music] and there's no other blood that could save my sins sick Soul there's no other blood that could conquer death and win my victory there's no other blood but the blood that Jesus shares for me come and worship him those of you who won't do for his [Music] Precious Blood of another of his blood pressure blood for it was the sins [Music] said my spirit brings you all I'm so glad [Music] for his blood let me hear you of another spotless [Music] Precious Blood foreign [Music] thank you Glory Hallelujah [Music] I choose my love again tonight you've not chosen your lamb choose him tonight the Bible tells us the book of Exodus that every man has to have a lamb it's Passover time and every man has to have a lamb you pull him aside right about now you examine him for four days and if you were living in the time of Christ you would have had to buy you a lamb you'd have had to pull him aside and look over him with a fine-tooth comb to make sure that he was spotless in every way and then after you've examined him three o'clock in the afternoon on the day of Passover which was not Friday you're going to crucify that lamb you're going to sacrifice that lamb and had it not been for the Lord your whole future hung on that lamb being Worthy one lamb was too much you could join yourself with a household share the lamb but everybody had to have a lamb if you've not fully surrendered your life to Jesus Christ I challenge you tonight I challenge you in his name choose your lamb tonight choose your salvation tonight your hope it's only found in Repentance of sin Lord I'm sorry for the life I've lived I'm sorry for the lies I've told I'm sorry that I have left you out of my life and I come to you asking that you would take your blood and wash me clean maybe you would say I don't even know how to live a Christian life I don't even know how to serve the Lord but if you'll cleanse me I'll sit at your feet I'll learn What It Takes and what it means to serve the Lord somebody needs to choose their lamb tonight for [Music] fall of another [Music] and his blood heal my body and says [Music] if you're here tonight and you say I know Jesus is real but I've never made him my lamb I've never really chosen him as my lamb My Sacrifice and if you'll pray for me I I'd like to find the strength to make him my Lord I'm not going to invite you up here I'm not going to come to you unless the Lord sends me but I'm just going to ask you to raise up your hand right where you are you have nothing to be ashamed about you see I believe I believe in Jesus but I've not made him the Lord of my life I've not made in my lamb maybe you're watching this service and you you've never really made him your personal lamb that's what he wants to be tonight it's not just a household salvation it's an individual affair with the Lord Jesus he wants to have relationship with you as an individual and with you who are in this room is there someone that would just slip up your hand I see some of the children raising their hand God bless you for that you've got to have a lamb you've got to have a lamb here's a sweet little sister and some little sister back there you've got to have a lamb I'm so glad he's here I'm so glad he's available I'm still glad his blood still Cries Out if you're near some of these sweet children lay your hand on them right now and ask the Lord to help them if you saw another hand that I might have missed I see Moses's hand up he's already quite a worshiper but he wants to make sure that he has chosen his lamb tonight if you're near somebody who's put their hand up lay hands on them right now Tally's got her hand up Lord Jesus we ask that you would come into our lives wash us with your precious blood we are broken and we long to be whole again we understand that your blood can make us whole tonight we choose Jesus we choose you as our sacrifice [Music] we are broken we are wounded we are flawed but we approach God with a Holy Lamb and so Lord you don't look at our failure you look at our offering and our offering is the perfect Lamb of God John John the Baptist screamed out behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world that's not just who you were that's who you are bless these sweet children right now I wasn't even three years old when I invited the Lord into my life and he saved me filled me with the Holy Ghost at seven so I have a heart for children sometimes we as parents and church leaders can look over them like they don't understand I want you to know something children understand more today than they used to understand let's celebrate the beginning of their journey I got saved in a little Baptist Sunday school praying a prayer with my Sunday school teacher my aunt great aunt singing Come Into My Heart Lord Jesus I meant it with all my heart and he heard it and he came into my life Lord I ask you to do that come and Benjamin and lead us in worship before we go I've taken so much time all I can do is ask you to forgive me for taking so much time although I don't totally regret it can you apologize when you don't totally regret something let's Worship the Lord and see what he'll do before we leave 11 o'clock is service in the morning so you can sleep an extra 10-15 minutes I saw the Lord [Music] Seated on his throne yes he was clothing Glory [Music] salted house in the train of his Rose [Music] and the angels circled Round Here [Music] and cries [Music] foreign [Music] you are you are holy Lord I saw Seated on his throne big Glory oh think about it Church [Music] that is you are home [Music] holy Lord of Allelujah [Music] hear you [Music] holy oh so oh [Music] holy Lord [Music] for all who is unclean [Music] my eyes [Music] right before my pillars [Music] holy ghosts [Music] [Music] [Music] oh so [Music] Where You Are holy Lord come on [Music] so very holy holy [Music] holy Lord [Music] in Sunday School in the Pentecostal Church where I grew up in our Sunday school literature there was a picture of Abraham standing there with Isaac and the bush and the and the horn the Jews believed that one horn of that Ram represents the first Trump and the other Horn of that Ram represents the last Trump the Trump that's going to wake up the bride of Christ but in that little book it it looked like a ram just happened to be passing along and God allowed it to get its horn caught up in the thicket in the thorns and that's all right but that's not how the Jews interpret the Hebrew of that verse if you look at this little stature here you'll see that the angel was bringing the sacrifice they believed that God created supernaturally in that moment and that he hung that Ram up in the thicket but the angel of the Lord brought it I don't know whether that's how it happened or not but but we can say that's that makes a lot of sense to me and if you need a quote for it I don't have I don't have time to read them now but brother Branham in talking about this story he said well where did our Ram come from he said Abraham was a hundred miles from any civilization in any any kind of thing like that he said where did that Ram come from he said God put that Ram there why because it's a perfect type of God hanging our lamb he came the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us and I wanted you to leave here tonight with an image of that of that next Sun carrying that crossbar up that hill in Abraham's day God intervened and he provided a life so that Isaac didn't have to give his life but in our day when our lamb died on that cross there was no substitution God did not intervene in fact God turned the father turned away now figuratively we know that that is kenosis it means that our Lord was emptied in that final moment he was emptied of all the deity that had dwelt in him felt it can't be a hundred percent God in a hundred percent man and that shift like that and you not feel it he felt that the Divinity the divine nature had left him it was essential and necessary because God is eternal and the Zoe cannot die is that right so the deity of God had to leave Christ hang him there on the cross and what did he do he felt the agony oh Father father why hast Thou forsaken me the Bible tells us that figuratively the father couldn't even look upon him because he was so marred and so scarred not just by the beating but he had been transformed into the very image of sin the Bible said he was made sin that means that his physical form had been altered by the load and the weight of the sins of the world there was nothing in him that anybody would desire him Isaiah prophesied so there was nothing in him comely or handsome he was the very epitome of ugly and darkness and evil and a twisted physical form hanging there on that cross as the deity of the father left him somebody said then how are we saved then how are we saved if he died a man how are we saved anybody want to know because he had the blood it was the blood of God that was in his veins blood that had been specifically created by God for the Redemption of the world the very Zoe the very Greek word Zoe life the eternal life of God was in that blood the very life of the father was in that blood brother vandham said if you'd have been underneath that lamb that died that animal life the soul of that animal couldn't have fallen on you and done a thing for you but when that one single blood cell of our Lord Jesus broke open the life that was in that blood fell over on the believer and we were forever redeemed so don't you get upset if we shout a little bit and sing a little bit and dance a little bit don't you get a bit out of shape we've got everything in the world to worship God about now father go with us tonight and rest our bodies and Minds continue to deal with our hearts and draw us into your presence meet with us tomorrow with the victory of God the very shout of the king in the camp if there's anything that needs to fall off of us in your presence Grant it to be so granted that it would fall out of our lives we might be drawn
