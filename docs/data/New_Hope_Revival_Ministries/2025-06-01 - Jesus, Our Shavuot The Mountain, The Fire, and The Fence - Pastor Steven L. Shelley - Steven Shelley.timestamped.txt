[3:46] [Music]
[4:19] Down. Heat.
[4:23] [Music]
[4:33] I heard an old old
[4:36] story. How a savior came from
[4:41] glory. How he gave a life on
[4:45] Calvary to save a ranch like me.
[4:51] I heard about his groaning of his
[4:56] precious blood
[4:59] atoning and I repented of my sins and
[5:05] won the
[5:07] victory. Well,
[5:10] victory in Jesus my
[5:14] savior forever.
[5:17] You know he sought me and he bought me
[5:22] with his redeeing blood. Well, he loved
[5:27] me and I knew him and all my love is to
[5:33] him. He punched me to
[5:38] victory beneath the cleansing blood.
[5:43] I heard about his healing of his
[5:48] cleansing power
[5:51] revealing and how he made the lame to
[5:54] walk in. And he calls of the light to
[5:59] see. Well, and then I cry, "Dear Jesus,
[6:05] come and heal my
[6:07] broken spirit."
[6:09] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[6:15] the
[6:17] victory. Well,
[6:19] victory.
[6:21] Jesus, my
[6:23] savior
[6:25] forever. Well, he sought me and he
[6:29] bought me with his redeeming blood.
[6:35] Oh, he loved me. I knew him. And all my
[6:41] love is to him. He punched me to
[6:47] victory beneath the cleansing
[6:51] blood. I heard about a mansion that he
[6:57] has built for me in glory. Oh, when I
[7:01] heard about the streets of gold beyond
[7:06] the crystal
[7:08] sea and about the
[7:11] angels singing in the old
[7:15] redemption story
[7:17] glory and some sweet I'll sing up there
[7:22] that song of victory.
[7:26] Well,
[7:27] victory in Jesus my
[7:31] savior
[7:33] forever. You know he sought me and he
[7:37] bought me with his redeeming blood. Oh,
[7:43] he loved me and I knew him and all my
[7:48] love is to him. He punched me to
[7:54] victory.
[7:56] beneath the cleansing
[7:59] flood. I heard about his
[8:03] healing of his cleansing power
[8:07] revealing and how he made the lame to
[8:11] walk again. And he caused up the blind
[8:14] to
[8:15] see. And up you cry, "Dear Jesus, come
[8:21] and heal my broken spirit."
[8:25] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[8:30] that
[8:32] victory. Well,
[8:34] victory in Jesus. You're my
[8:39] savior
[8:40] forever. Oh, he sought me and he bought
[8:45] me with his redeeming blood. Oh, he
[8:50] loved me and I knew him and all my love
[8:56] is to him. He punched me to
[9:02] victory beneath the cleansing
[9:06] flood. I heard about that mansion he has
[9:11] built for me in glory.
[9:15] And I heard about those streets of gold
[9:19] just beyond the crystal sea and about
[9:24] the
[9:25] angels singing and the old
[9:29] redemption story. You know in some sweet
[9:33] day I'll sing up there that song of
[9:37] victory.
[9:39] Well,
[9:41] victory in Jesus my
[9:45] savior
[9:47] forever. He sought me and he bought me.
[9:52] Oh, with his redeeming blood. Oh, he
[9:57] loved me and I knew him and all my love
[10:03] is through him.
[10:05] Punish me to
[10:08] victory beneath the cleansing
[10:14] flood. Oh,
[10:16] hallelujah. We've got victory in
[10:19] Jesus. Thank you, Lord.

[33:26] the anointing, the yoke is destroyed.

[47:25] not have faith if it wasn't for you
[47:29] revealing yourself to us. That's right.
[47:33] And so we see you now.
[47:38] as the
[47:42] king. There was something that quickened
[47:44] in me the other day
[47:48] that you acknowledged that you were the
[47:50] king.
[47:52] You came to this earth. You said I am
[47:56] and this is why I came. You came to
[47:59] reveal the king of kings.
[48:03] But at the same time, you were a lamb.
[48:06] Yes. And you came to redeem all of those
[48:10] that were in you even before the
[48:12] foundation of the world. Amen. Hear him
[48:16] calling out your name. Hear him now
[48:20] calling out your name.
[48:23] He knows every need. Yes, Lord.
[48:26] Everything that is in your heart right
[48:27] now, he knows it. And he is beckoning
[48:31] you to come to him. weaknesses
[48:34] expose everything
[48:37] because that's where the freedom comes.
[48:39] He comes into that place and he redeems
[48:42] and he heals and he delivers. Yes.
[48:47] It's so powerful, Lord, that your blood,
[48:51] it gives us access.
[48:53] But at the same time, it covers us.
[48:55] Amen. And then at the same time,
[48:58] hallelujah, it's on the inside. It's
[49:00] cleaning. It's restoring. It's bringing
[49:03] life. Oh, Father, we thank you for this
[49:06] plan of redemption.
[49:08] We're putting all of our trust in you
[49:10] right now, sir. And we thank you that we
[49:13] were we're talking about there's power
[49:15] in the blood and there's authority in

[49:21] the Lord Jesus Christ, we do speak to
[49:24] every deceased to bow down. Oh God, we
[49:28] ask you to have your way in our lives.
[49:30] May every doubt crumble beneath the feet
[49:34] of the Lord Jesus Christ. May we raise
[49:37] up in your name. You position ourselves
[49:41] us in you and you gave us everything.
[49:46] So by now we place ourselves in you.
[49:49] That's where everything that we need
[49:53] is provided. Thank you for that. What a
[49:56] plan.
[49:58] And so, Father, we just commit ourselves
[50:00] to you. Anything that is in our lives
[50:03] right
[50:05] now that is hindering hindering our next
[50:09] step towards your perfect plan. May we
[50:12] just yield it right now to you. And may
[50:16] the overcoming anointing that is
[50:19] promised, may it come and take over as
[50:22] we fully commit ourselves to you right
[50:26] now. Amen. We commit the rest of the
[50:29] service to you.

[51:24] day he gives me something to love him
[51:27] over and over again. Yes, he does. We
[51:30] want to welcome this family back here.
[51:32] The Lord bless you. We're glad that
[51:34] you're here and and we welcome you in
[51:37] the service today. May the Lord bless
[51:39] [Applause]
[51:43] you. The the
[51:46] the house of the Lord is a welcome
[51:48] place, a welcoming atmosphere. We should
[51:51] we should have one here. And we welcome
[51:54] those that come among us. And we're glad
[51:56] that this family has come to be with us
[51:58] today. Austin, it's nice to see you
[52:01] today. The Lord bless
[52:08] you. Gregory and family. We're glad to
[52:10] see you today. The Lord bless you. We're
[52:12] glad that you're here.
[52:17] It's nice to see Jessica and Brandy
[52:18] again sitting right up
[52:22] [Applause]
[52:24] close. I'm glad to be in the house of
[52:26] the
[52:27] Lord, to be renewed and refreshed in his
[52:31] presence.
[52:33] We're here today to worship him, to
[52:37] praise him, to lift him up, and he in
[52:40] turn feeds us from uh the the bread of
[52:44] life that we need to sustain us in this
[52:48] world of chaos. There's plenty of it out
[52:51] there, but we don't have to be chaotic.
[52:54] We don't have to take on the the stink
[52:57] of the world, the chaos of the world,
[52:59] their fragrance. We carry the fragrance
[53:02] of the lamb. And and that is why that we
[53:05] gather in the house of the Lord to be
[53:07] with our brothers and sisters and and to
[53:10] be in that corporate anointing uh
[53:13] together with our family, the family of
[53:17] God. It's just good to be here today.
[53:20] We're going to in just a moment or two,
[53:22] we're going to receive the tithe and the
[53:24] offering. We want to give as unto the
[53:27] Lord. uh the Jerusalem rent is due and
[53:30] that account is low. It there's not
[53:33] enough to cover it. If the Lord should
[53:35] speak to you to help us to get that
[53:37] covered, uh would you uh just tuck that
[53:40] in an envelope and mark it as Jerusalem?
[53:44] The Lord has been faithful through these
[53:46] 20 plus years of of of us renting that
[53:50] apartment. We don't understand
[53:52] everything that he's called us to, but
[53:54] we know that he has called us and we
[53:56] want to be faithful to that just as he
[53:59] has called us to these acres of ground
[54:01] that he has given to us and and now
[54:04] debtree by the grace of God. We're
[54:07] thankful for it. We're thankful that
[54:09] there's no
[54:13] debt. To those of you that are on this
[54:15] ground, that live here on the ground,
[54:17] there will be activity this week. God
[54:19] willing, there's going to be uh some
[54:22] dirt moving in preparation for getting
[54:25] the water rerouted so that it doesn't
[54:28] run across the parking lot so that in
[54:30] turn we can have the parking lot sealed
[54:32] and the lines repainted. We're looking
[54:34] forward to having that done before camp
[54:36] meeting by the grace of God. But this
[54:39] week, the dirt uh Joshua is home with
[54:42] his team. We don't know who all will
[54:44] help him. uh those of you that perhaps
[54:47] are young and can be here to help
[54:49] Joshua, that would be appreciated
[54:51] because I just can't be this week. I'm
[54:54] I'm sorry. I just couldn't be here this
[54:56] week, but I'll be in and out. But uh if
[54:58] you can be here to be of assistance and
[55:02] uh
[55:03] unfortunately there is something called
[55:06] erosion. And through the years that we
[55:09] have been in this building over across
[55:11] the driveway, that ditch line has
[55:15] eroded. And we like the green grass. But
[55:19] unfortunately, we have to tear up that
[55:21] green grass in order to get the ditch
[55:24] back where it belongs. And then we're
[55:27] going to have to lay sod so that the
[55:29] dirt don't wash. And we are going to
[55:32] need some concentrated effort from
[55:36] everybody to make sure that the grass
[55:39] gets watered, that sprinklers removed,
[55:41] that we don't spend money for sod and
[55:44] then lose it. And so anything that you
[55:47] can do to help us to make sure that that
[55:50] sod lives because we want to cover up
[55:53] the red mud and not have it washing.
[55:56] Then uh also this hill up here will be
[55:59] done. Again, those of you that live on
[56:02] the property, there is a pipe that we
[56:05] are going to have to cut and make a
[56:07] repair to get it to go in the ground
[56:10] more than it is now. So, we will try to
[56:13] warn you if we're going to turn the
[56:14] water off, but please be patient with
[56:17] us. It is part of progress. It is part
[56:21] of getting things done. So, that's just
[56:23] some FYI. And uh there's lots to do on
[56:27] this campground at all times. grass
[56:30] cutting, grass trimming, there's edging
[56:32] that needs done. There's there's Roundup
[56:35] that needs to be sprayed on some on some
[56:37] grass that's in the parking lot. All of
[56:39] these things need done. If you can
[56:41] assist us, I'm not 35 anymore. I just I
[56:46] I don't have as much stamina as I used
[56:48] to have, besides the fact that I'm
[56:51] helping somebody to build a
[56:53] house. And I've been in the ditch this
[56:56] week because there was erosion over
[56:59] there. But by God's grace, by God's
[57:02] grace, we're moving forward. And we're
[57:05] just glad to know that we're operating
[57:08] under the the banner of the Lord Jesus
[57:11] Christ and that he gives us grace and
[57:14] strength for anything that he calls us
[57:16] to do. Uh where there is a vision, there
[57:20] is provision. And it's not just money
[57:22] provision. It's strength provision. It's
[57:25] it's it's provision up here to help us
[57:28] with our mental tasks. God provides what
[57:32] we need and I'm grateful to it. Brother
[57:35] Cade's going to sing today and lead us
[57:37] on into the into the preaching of the
[57:39] word. Brother Ellas, can I call on you?
[57:43] And let's see, Ian, I'm going to call on
[57:44] you as well today. I'm going to let
[57:46] these two brothers come to you for the
[57:48] tithe and offering. If you want credit
[57:50] for your tithe, for your taxes, it needs
[57:52] to be in an envelope with your name and
[57:54] your address on it so that we can give
[57:56] proper credit. And may God bless you as
[57:59] you give to the Lord. Amen.
[58:36] [Music]
[58:37] Once my
[58:39] soul was a
[58:41] stray from the
[58:45] heavenly way.
[58:48] I was wretched and I was
[58:52] vile as could
[58:58] be. But my
[59:01] Savior
[59:02] above, he gave me
[59:05] peace, joy, and
[59:08] love when he
[59:11] reached down his
[59:13] hand for me.
[59:19] When he
[59:21] reached down his
[59:24] hand for
[59:29] me, when he
[59:31] reached way
[59:34] down for
[59:39] me, I was
[59:41] lost in a dark room without
[59:46] God for his
[59:49] son when he
[59:52] reached down his
[59:54] hand for me.
[59:59] Well, and I was
[1:00:02] near in
[1:00:04] despair when he
[1:00:07] came to me
[1:00:09] there and he showed
[1:00:12] me that
[1:00:14] I could go
[1:00:19] free. Then he
[1:00:21] lifted up my feet. He gave me glory.
[1:00:29] compete. When he
[1:00:31] reached down his
[1:00:34] hand for
[1:00:37] [Music]
[1:00:39] me. When he
[1:00:41] reached down his
[1:00:44] hand for me.
[1:00:50] any
[1:00:52] reach way
[1:00:54] down for
[1:00:58] me. Well, I was
[1:01:01] lost and not
[1:01:04] done without
[1:01:06] God or his
[1:01:09] son when he
[1:01:11] reached down his
[1:01:14] hand for me.
[1:01:17] [Music]
[1:01:20] How my
[1:01:21] heart can
[1:01:23] rejoice since I
[1:01:26] made him
[1:01:28] rejoice. From the
[1:01:31] tempest, now to
[1:01:33] him I will flee.
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:01:39] Now I lean on his arm and I'm
[1:01:45] secure from all
[1:01:48] harm. When he
[1:01:51] reach down his
[1:01:53] hand for
[1:01:57] me. Oh when he
[1:02:00] reached way
[1:02:03] down for
[1:02:06] me. I remember when he
[1:02:10] reached out his
[1:02:13] hand for me.
[1:02:18] Well, I was lost. I was lost and undone.
[1:02:23] Oh, without
[1:02:25] God for his son.
[1:02:29] But he reached reach out down his
[1:02:33] hand for me. Let's get together.
[1:02:37] Sing when he
[1:02:40] reach down his
[1:02:43] [Music]
[1:02:45] hand. When he
[1:02:47] [Music]
[1:02:50] reach me
[1:02:52] down for me.
[1:02:58] Well, I was
[1:03:00] lost and undone without God. without
[1:03:05] God or his son
[1:03:08] when he
[1:03:09] reached down his
[1:03:12] hand for me.
[1:03:18] Well, I was lost and
[1:03:22] undone without
[1:03:25] God or his son. when he reached down
[1:03:29] when he
[1:03:30] reached down his
[1:03:33] hand for me. If you're glad that he did,
[1:03:37] would you give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:03:40] praise? Praise
[1:03:44] God.
[1:03:50] Hallelujah. We used to sing a song. song
[1:03:52] I sung with a group years ago and we
[1:03:54] used to sing a song that said when he re
[1:03:56] uh his hand reached farther down than I
[1:04:00] could reach up. Aren't you glad of that?
[1:04:04] When when we reach as high as we could,
[1:04:06] we might have never touched him, but he
[1:04:08] could reach farther down. You may be
[1:04:11] seated. He He can reach farther down
[1:04:13] than we can reach up. There are times
[1:04:15] that we can't. Now, uh I know we have
[1:04:18] visitors here this morning. I'm so glad
[1:04:20] they're here. Uh, and we have some
[1:04:23] missing and we're praying for them. But
[1:04:25] I want everybody to uh slip out. I'm
[1:04:28] fixing to sing a song. If you need to go
[1:04:31] to the washroom, there's been a lot of
[1:04:33] moving around this morning. And I'm not
[1:04:35] talking about mothers with children
[1:04:37] because that is that's what we we we
[1:04:40] pray for and believe for and want. I
[1:04:43] don't ever ever ever want a mother to
[1:04:46] feel bad or dad who's taking a little
[1:04:49] time to to uh help take care of the
[1:04:52] children because they're yours too. You
[1:04:55] help get them here. You have some
[1:04:57] responsibility in it. Amen. I appreciate
[1:05:00] the brothers that do that and help their
[1:05:02] wives. Some can't because they're busy
[1:05:05] up here, but uh there is a lot of moving
[1:05:08] around and in and out and uh uh maybe
[1:05:11] necessary, but maybe not. And you know,
[1:05:14] when we do that, sometimes we actually
[1:05:15] just disturb the the the the anointing
[1:05:19] that's kind of building. You can so
[1:05:21] easily just kind of disturb that. I I
[1:05:25] know that God knows our hearts and if
[1:05:27] we're going because we need to and have
[1:05:29] to, I believe he understands that. Don't
[1:05:31] you? But, uh, let's try to be, uh, as
[1:05:35] reverend as we possibly can. Now, I hope
[1:05:38] I didn't put a real a stifle on anything
[1:05:41] by saying that, but sometimes we've got
[1:05:44] to remember this isn't your house.
[1:05:48] Amen. Well, I I don't know how this
[1:05:52] happened, but I know Brother Gley has
[1:05:54] taken some time this morning to but but
[1:05:57] it's necessary sometime to let people
[1:05:59] know what's going on. And uh especially
[1:06:02] some of you who drive too fast uh on the
[1:06:05] property. Shall I call your name so
[1:06:07] you'll know it's you? Uh you need to
[1:06:09] slow down because there are little
[1:06:11] children running around sometime during
[1:06:13] the week and there's going to be some
[1:06:15] heavy equipment here. And I don't know
[1:06:17] if you've ever seen what a vehicle looks
[1:06:19] like when it collides with a with a
[1:06:21] heavy piece of equipment. I promise you
[1:06:25] your equipment's going to win, brother.
[1:06:27] It's going to win. So let's be careful.
[1:06:30] Uh, one day, what day was it? Friday.
[1:06:33] Friday was just an odd day already. We
[1:06:36] were here. I was in my office and
[1:06:38] working on some things. And there came a
[1:06:41] a FedEx man to the back door. Can I take
[1:06:44] a minute to tell you what's happened?
[1:06:46] FedEx man came to the back door and uh
[1:06:48] he was all tatted up and uh really he
[1:06:52] looked a mess. Benjamin said, "Dad, I I
[1:06:54] I don't know, but he said,"I I I don't I
[1:06:57] wonder if he is on drugs or something
[1:07:00] working." He, you know, just he he just
[1:07:02] seemed really off. And uh and and
[1:07:08] Benjamin, he hands him a package. He
[1:07:09] said, "Well, if you will just deliver
[1:07:11] the packages there to the door to the
[1:07:14] other glass door, that's where they
[1:07:16] always drop them off and anybody that
[1:07:18] lives here can just come and pick them
[1:07:20] up because if they go down there where
[1:07:22] it's soft and they make a big mess." Uh,
[1:07:26] so he did that. Well, a little while my
[1:07:28] wife come in. She was bringing something
[1:07:29] over the fellowship hall. She came in
[1:07:31] and that kind of surprised me because
[1:07:34] she's so busy that a lot of times when
[1:07:35] she's here doing something, I don't even
[1:07:37] see her. and was glad to see her. That
[1:07:40] brightened my day. And then uh just
[1:07:43] several things were all happened at one
[1:07:45] time. Benjamin said, "He's still here."
[1:07:48] Said, "The FedEx guy is still here." And
[1:07:50] this was I'd say half an hour almost 20
[1:07:53] minutes at least, or no, not 15, 20
[1:07:55] minutes. And uh so he said, "He has just
[1:07:59] driven across the
[1:08:03] grass and
[1:08:05] and I I don't want him doing that." at.
[1:08:07] Do you understand?
[1:08:09] This This has a good
[1:08:14] ending. I I don't want you to think I
[1:08:16] punched him or anything. This has a good
[1:08:18] ending. Get with me. And he did. He
[1:08:22] literally pulled right across there.
[1:08:25] I I thought to myself, if he only knew
[1:08:27] how hard it is to keep grass on red mud
[1:08:32] and it was real soft and I'm surprised
[1:08:34] he didn't bury down, but you could just
[1:08:38] see my I said, "I'm going to tell him."
[1:08:40] He didn't know. I'm going to tell him.
[1:08:42] And so I'm a big sort of fella and I
[1:08:45] don't move as fast as some folks do. And
[1:08:48] I just took off through the through the
[1:08:49] yard. I don't know why I did it. I I
[1:08:52] don't usually do things like that, but I
[1:08:54] went running under the portico there and
[1:08:57] down out by the by the uh mailboxes, and
[1:09:00] just about the time I got there, he
[1:09:02] starts to pull off. And so I yelled,
[1:09:06] "Hey, hey."
[1:09:10] And he
[1:09:12] go and uh he rolled his window down and
[1:09:15] I ran over and I said, "Please, sir,
[1:09:18] kind sir, please don't drive across the
[1:09:22] grass anymore. I I don't want to be one
[1:09:24] of those people. And I'm not here to to
[1:09:27] uh ball you out. I wanted to, but I'm
[1:09:30] not here to ball you out. I'm just here
[1:09:32] to ask you if you ever have to deliver
[1:09:33] here again, would you please not drive
[1:09:36] across the grass?" He said, 'Well, I
[1:09:38] couldn't get by.' Well, he got by my
[1:09:41] vehicle to to drop off. Then he had
[1:09:44] nowhere to go. Because he realized his
[1:09:47] truck was taller than the
[1:09:49] portico. And I'm glad he didn't just
[1:09:52] take the portico with
[1:09:54] him. And as disoriented as he was, I'm
[1:09:57] surprised he didn't. And so he knew that
[1:10:00] he couldn't back the truck all the way
[1:10:01] up. And I guess he was afraid he
[1:10:03] couldn't turn it around. So he just took
[1:10:04] off across the grass. And as I'm telling
[1:10:06] him that, uh, he's shaking his head and
[1:10:09] rubbing his head and and I think, Lord,
[1:10:11] am I pushing him over the edge? And I
[1:10:13] said, "Can I are you all
[1:10:15] right? Are you all right?" He said, "No,
[1:10:18] sir. I am not all right." He said, "I
[1:10:21] have just hit my
[1:10:23] head right before I I I did that. I have
[1:10:27] hit my head harder than I've ever hit my
[1:10:30] head in my life." And he said, "I saw
[1:10:33] stars and my knees got weak. I thought I
[1:10:36] was going to pass out." And I said, "Oh
[1:10:39] my, I am so sorry to hear that. I don't
[1:10:43] know if you should drive. You might have
[1:10:46] a concussion." He said, "I might." He
[1:10:48] said, "I've never hit my" I said, "Well,
[1:10:51] let me pray for you." And he
[1:10:54] goes, "Boy, I was glad I didn't bless
[1:10:57] him
[1:10:58] out cuz now I got to pray for him." I
[1:11:01] said, "Lord Jesus, help him. Touch him.
[1:11:05] He's got He said, "I'm running behind.
[1:11:07] I've got more packages than I'll ever
[1:11:09] get delivered today. And and now I've
[1:11:11] done this and he's in such and I Oh,
[1:11:14] Jesus, help him."
[1:11:16] And as I'm running
[1:11:19] by, I look and there are what, eight, 10
[1:11:22] boxes, big boxes that he has delivered
[1:11:27] here. And uh some of you all do get a
[1:11:30] lot of packages, but they're not
[1:11:32] normally that
[1:11:34] big and uh taller than
[1:11:37] Benjamin. And he he sees a name on them.
[1:11:41] He opens opens them up. And someone had
[1:11:44] heard us say some time back that the old
[1:11:47] set of drums, some of them were uh way
[1:11:49] over 20some years old that were electric
[1:11:52] drums that were generation two and now
[1:11:54] they're up generation seven and they
[1:11:57] were having to reset them every time
[1:11:58] they used them. They were one electrical
[1:12:02] storm away from stopping probably.
[1:12:05] and
[1:12:07] somebody uh took it on themselves to to
[1:12:12] buy a brand new set. And I want you to
[1:12:15] know it was very very costly and uh they
[1:12:19] don't want they don't want it to be told
[1:12:21] who but we are so grateful and so
[1:12:24] thankful. Now you may not like them like
[1:12:26] drums. I do.
[1:12:29] I've read the Psalms, right? And I know
[1:12:32] that it takes everything sometime to
[1:12:34] make a song work and to make make an
[1:12:36] atmosphere just right. And uh we used to
[1:12:39] have some that would come after the
[1:12:41] worship service. Well, if you have to do
[1:12:43] that, you can. But leave us alone while
[1:12:45] we're trying to build an atmosphere. We
[1:12:48] didn't have the money to replace them.
[1:12:50] And literally, I had been told three
[1:12:52] times, "They're they're gone. I don't
[1:12:54] think I can that I can't get them to go
[1:12:56] turn on. I I don't know what we're going
[1:12:57] to do." And uh God moved
[1:13:01] and I'm very thankful. I'm very
[1:13:04] thankful. They're
[1:13:05] [Applause]
[1:13:08] beautiful. They're
[1:13:10] beautiful. And I got a chance to pray
[1:13:13] for that young man and he needed it. I'm
[1:13:15] telling you, he didn't just have a hard
[1:13:17] head. I mean a head, a hard hit on his
[1:13:20] head. He had a lot of other things going
[1:13:21] on. I promise you that. And Jesus cares.
[1:13:25] Yes. And had he not run across the
[1:13:28] grass, I promise you, I would have never
[1:13:30] chased the FedEx truck.
[1:13:33] So God arranges things sometimes. We
[1:13:36] have to remember to behave ourselves.
[1:13:39] Cuz if I would have went out there and
[1:13:40] told, "What kind of nut are you? You,
[1:13:43] you know, if I have said all them kind
[1:13:44] of things, well, he wouldn't have needed
[1:13:46] my prayers." And so I'm glad of that.
[1:13:49] I'm glad of the gift. I'm thankful that
[1:13:51] someone heard and answered that need and
[1:13:54] and it's a it was big for us and we're
[1:13:57] thankful. Very very thankful. Amen.
[1:14:02] [Applause]
[1:14:06] You ready?
[1:14:11] We've not had much
[1:14:14] time to do this,
[1:14:17] but the Lord just put it on my heart
[1:14:20] this morning. And they told me when we
[1:14:23] were running over it once that Ben had
[1:14:25] just asked about the song recently. Was
[1:14:28] it this morning? At the same time that I
[1:14:30] was texting, Ben said, "We ought to get
[1:14:32] him get them to sing this." So, we'll
[1:14:35] try. This is Kate's first time playing
[1:14:38] it. And you got a mic?
[1:14:42] Whatever happened, do death do us
[1:14:46] part? Does the home reflect the
[1:14:50] heart? Parents faces tell of worried
[1:14:54] minds while children search but can't
[1:14:58] seem to find. It's time we took a closer
[1:15:03] look. Got back to living by the holy
[1:15:07] book.
[1:15:09] No compromising without getting
[1:15:12] slack. You see, we'll go forward if
[1:15:15] we'll just go
[1:15:17] back. We've got to go back to living
[1:15:21] true. We're going back to the
[1:15:26] absolute. Back to where the church
[1:15:29] stands strong. Back to where there's a
[1:15:33] right. There is a wrong. back to where
[1:15:36] it's black or
[1:15:38] white. You see the differences like day
[1:15:42] and night. We're going back to things
[1:15:47] above. We're going back to our first
[1:15:53] love. We'll know a tree by the fruit we
[1:15:57] see. Serving God has no in between.
[1:16:03] We're either cold or else we're
[1:16:06] hot. He said lukewarm will have no part.
[1:16:11] It's coming down to in or
[1:16:14] out. Oh, there ain't no time for playing
[1:16:19] around. We're going back to lost or
[1:16:23] found. We're going back to stand our
[1:16:27] ground. We've got to go back to living
[1:16:31] true.
[1:16:32] We're going back to God's Sabbath
[1:16:36] salute. Back to where the church stands
[1:16:40] strong. Back to where there's a right.
[1:16:44] There is a wrong. Back to where it's
[1:16:47] black or
[1:16:48] white. You see the difference is like
[1:16:51] day and night. We're going back to
[1:16:55] things
[1:16:56] above. We're going back to our first
[1:17:00] love.
[1:17:01] [Music]
[1:17:04] We'll know a tree by the fruit we see.
[1:17:08] Serving God has no in
[1:17:11] between. We're either cold or else we're
[1:17:15] hot. Jesus said, "Lukewarm, we'll have
[1:17:18] no
[1:17:19] part. It's coming down to get or
[1:17:24] out. There's no time for playing around.
[1:17:29] We're going back to lost or found
[1:17:33] church. We're going back to stand our
[1:17:36] ground. We've got to go back to living
[1:17:40] true. We're going back to this
[1:17:44] absolute. Back to where the church
[1:17:47] stands strong. Back to where there's a
[1:17:51] right. There is a wrong. Back to where
[1:17:54] it's black or white.
[1:17:57] You see the difference is life and
[1:18:00] night. We're going back to things
[1:18:04] above. We're going back to our first
[1:18:08] love.
[1:18:11] Listen. And then we'll rise like a
[1:18:14] sleeping giant, standing tall in God's
[1:18:18] strength and might. The power that we
[1:18:21] claim so long, you'll see it returning.
[1:18:25] We're being made strong. We're not
[1:18:29] looking to the right or the left. Our
[1:18:33] eyes are spirit
[1:18:35] led. We're going back to true or false.
[1:18:40] Church, we've got to get back to
[1:18:42] Calvar's cross. We've got to go back to
[1:18:46] living true. Lift it up, somebody. We're
[1:18:49] going back to the
[1:18:51] absolute. Back to where the church
[1:18:55] stands strong. Back to where there's a
[1:18:58] right
[1:19:00] now. Back to where it's black or
[1:19:03] white. You see the difference is like
[1:19:06] day and night. We're going back to
[1:19:10] things
[1:19:11] above. We're going back to our first
[1:19:15] love and
[1:19:17] worse. And then we'll rise like a
[1:19:21] sleeping giant standing tall in God's
[1:19:25] strength and might. The power that we
[1:19:29] claim so long. That's right. Oh, we see
[1:19:32] him returning. We're being made strong.
[1:19:35] We're not looking to the right or the
[1:19:38] left. Our eyes are
[1:19:42] spiritless. We're going back to true our
[1:19:46] faults. Church, we've got to get back to
[1:19:49] Calvar's cross. We've got to go back to
[1:19:53] living true. Oh, going back to God's
[1:19:58] absolutes. Back to where his church
[1:20:01] stands strong. Back to where there's a
[1:20:05] right. There's still a wrong back to
[1:20:08] where it's black or
[1:20:10] white. You see the differences like day
[1:20:14] and night. We're going back to things
[1:20:18] above. We're going back to our first.
[1:20:22] Sing it one more time. We've got to go
[1:20:24] back to living
[1:20:26] true. We're going back to this absolute.
[1:20:31] Amen. Back to where the church stands
[1:20:35] strong. Back to where there's a right.
[1:20:38] There is a wrong. Back to where it's
[1:20:41] black or white.
[1:20:43] You see the difference is like day and
[1:20:47] night. We're going back to things
[1:20:51] above. We're going back to our first
[1:20:57] love. We're going back to things
[1:21:01] above. We're going back to our
[1:21:08] love. Has to be Jesus.
[1:21:14] It has to be
[1:21:16] him. There's one absolute.
[1:21:23] Hallelujah.
[1:21:26] There's one absolute
[1:21:29] and that's God's word. It's the
[1:21:31] ultimate.
[1:21:33] Not Book of Mormon,
[1:21:37] not Ellen
[1:21:39] White. that that's not an absolute,
[1:21:43] not even the recorded sermons of Brother
[1:21:46] Brandham.
[1:21:47] It's only that word that we can know as
[1:21:51] an absolute.
[1:21:53] Amen.
[1:21:54] Somebody said, "Well, men wrote it."
[1:21:56] Well, that's not what the scripture
[1:21:57] says. The scripture said God wrote it.
[1:22:01] Says he moved on men. Amen. That was the
[1:22:06] foundation of it all. God's been good to
[1:22:09] send a message to help us understand and
[1:22:12] the revelation of what's contained
[1:22:14] therein. But we must never get out on a
[1:22:17] limb over here and not be able to bring
[1:22:19] what we stand for back to the Bible.
[1:22:22] Anybody with me on that? Let's thank the
[1:22:25] Lord for the musicians, all the hard
[1:22:32] work. Turn in your Bible this morning. I
[1:22:35] need just a tad more here. Exodus
[1:22:38] chapter
[1:22:41] 19 and verse 12 and 13. I'll hurry the
[1:22:46] best I'm capable of doing this morning.
[1:22:50] I've got a lot of ground to cover and uh
[1:22:54] I'll need the Lord's help most of all,
[1:22:56] but I'll need your help as well. So do
[1:22:58] what you can.
[1:23:00] Send out an amen when you can and wiggle
[1:23:04] your toe in your shoe when you can and
[1:23:07] put your faith in here and let's see
[1:23:09] what the Lord can do for us. Amen. Today
[1:23:13] is Victoria's birthday, Sister Tiffany's
[1:23:17] little girl, Victoria, and we want to
[1:23:19] wish her a happy birthday. And this
[1:23:22] Tuesday would have been uh Anthony
[1:23:25] Chadwick's birthday, Sister Cindy. and
[1:23:28] uh you're first without him. Is that
[1:23:30] right? Or you're first without him. And
[1:23:32] so uh we don't believe in birthdays in
[1:23:36] heaven, but we do believe that we're
[1:23:38] going to think about him on that day.
[1:23:40] And we're going to pray for his family
[1:23:42] and we're going to pray for Sister Cindy
[1:23:44] that the Lord will keep adding strength
[1:23:46] to her. And then on Wednesday of this
[1:23:49] week is my queen's birthday, Sister
[1:23:52] Stacy's birthday. and and uh I won't
[1:23:55] tell you her age except to say that
[1:23:58] whatever it is, it's
[1:24:00] repeated. So, she could be 11 or she
[1:24:03] could be 44 or she could be whatever
[1:24:06] else. I will go ahead and tell you she's
[1:24:09] not
[1:24:12] 66. And uh Austin, well, he just found a
[1:24:15] way somehow. I don't know how he pulled
[1:24:17] it off, but he found a way to get off
[1:24:20] work, shut down a job, and whatever else
[1:24:23] to be here so that we could remember his
[1:24:25] birthday also on the 4th. So, you better
[1:24:28] say happy birthday to him or he he might
[1:24:30] leave tomorrow and go work again for
[1:24:32] another few months. Happy birthday to
[1:24:39] Austin. Uh, Exodus chapter 19. I still
[1:24:44] need just a tad more up
[1:24:46] here. Verse 12. And thou shalt set
[1:24:52] bounds unto the people round about,
[1:24:56] saying, Take heed to
[1:24:59] yourselves, that ye go not
[1:25:02] up into the mount, or touch the border
[1:25:08] of it. Now, now let's read that
[1:25:12] carefully.
[1:25:14] Thou shalt set bounds unto the people
[1:25:17] round about, saying, Take heed to
[1:25:21] yourselves, that you go not up into the
[1:25:24] mount, or touch the border of it, the
[1:25:30] mount. Whosoever toucheth the mount
[1:25:35] shall be
[1:25:37] surely put to death.
[1:25:40] I'd say that's serious business.
[1:25:44] There shall not a hand touch
[1:25:47] it, but he shall surely be stoned or
[1:25:51] shot
[1:25:53] through. There weren't shotguns then,
[1:25:56] but there were
[1:25:57] arrows. Whether it be beast or
[1:26:01] man, it shall not live.
[1:26:07] When the trumpet soundth
[1:26:10] long, they shall come up to the
[1:26:16] mount. How many of you believe you
[1:26:18] recognize where this story is in
[1:26:21] scripture?
[1:26:22] Anybody? Let's have a quick prayer.
[1:26:25] Father, we thank you for this another
[1:26:28] opportunity to look to your word. Your
[1:26:30] word is
[1:26:31] life. And we just pray right now for
[1:26:35] peace in the atmosphere. We pray Lord
[1:26:39] that your word will come forth and will
[1:26:41] accomplish in us exactly what you would
[1:26:44] so desire. We take authority over every
[1:26:48] spirit of darkness in the name of
[1:26:51] Yeshua, in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:54] Christ. And we command you to retreat as
[1:26:58] the light of the true gospel of Jesus
[1:27:00] Christ comes forth. Lord, anoint our
[1:27:03] ears to hear, our hearts to understand
[1:27:07] and anoint, Lord, lips to speak forth
[1:27:10] this truth. and we'll give you glory and
[1:27:13] honor and praise for it's in the name of
[1:27:16] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the
[1:27:18] saints said amen you may be
[1:27:24] seated now we are once again in a
[1:27:30] dilemma on the
[1:27:32] calendar
[1:27:34] because you know under
[1:27:38] Constantine the calendar was shifted it.
[1:27:42] And we are looking
[1:27:47] at sundown tonight, the beginning of
[1:27:51] Shàuote. The church knows Shàuote as
[1:27:56] Pentecost because it happens exactly 50
[1:28:00] days after the
[1:28:03] resurrection. And that was the feast of
[1:28:06] first fruits. And Jesus raised from the
[1:28:10] dead at the right time on the right day
[1:28:13] at the right moment to
[1:28:16] fulfill. He became a human living
[1:28:20] uh wave sheath waved over the people to
[1:28:25] say this is what a mature son looks
[1:28:28] like. Both God and man existing in one
[1:28:32] being in one body. What a great mystery.
[1:28:36] The prophet of the Old Testament said,
[1:28:38] "I'm going to do a thing that has never
[1:28:40] been done. I I'm going to do something
[1:28:43] that has never happened before." And
[1:28:45] surely he did. Amen. The Holy Ghost
[1:28:48] overshadowed a little maiden whose
[1:28:52] Jewish name was Miriam. We call her
[1:28:54] Mary. And she was not the mother of God.
[1:28:58] Just so you'll know, God doesn't have
[1:29:00] nor does God need a mother. Are you with
[1:29:03] me? So don't pray to Mary. You're
[1:29:06] wasting your time. She's busy. She's
[1:29:09] worshiping the Lord. She's worshiping
[1:29:11] God. She's thankful to have made it. How
[1:29:15] do you know she made it? Because Jesus
[1:29:18] insisted that she received the Holy
[1:29:20] Ghost.
[1:29:23] He left word, "You take care of my
[1:29:25] mother. Make sure she gets what you got.
[1:29:29] What you get, make sure she gets it, so
[1:29:31] to speak." and she did. And so we do not
[1:29:36] believe that she ascended to heaven from
[1:29:39] Jerusalem as some teach. We believe that
[1:29:43] she died in what is now modern Turkey
[1:29:46] and was buried next to the ruins of one
[1:29:49] of the seven churches of Asia Minor. And
[1:29:52] uh it was the Catholic Church and her
[1:29:55] variations that decided to to venerate
[1:29:59] her and to uh give her this exalted
[1:30:02] status as the mother of God. If she
[1:30:05] could speak to this world today, I don't
[1:30:08] believe she's talking to us, but if she
[1:30:11] could, she would say, "Don't worship me.
[1:30:14] Don't look at me. Don't pray to me.
[1:30:18] Don't burn a candle in my name. you go
[1:30:21] to him.
[1:30:23] And uh she would give us the advice
[1:30:26] today that she gave them then in Canaa
[1:30:29] of Galilee.
[1:30:31] What are we going to do? They went to
[1:30:32] Mary and they said that we don't have
[1:30:35] enough wine. The wine is running out and
[1:30:38] she said just go to him and whatever.
[1:30:40] Hallelujah.
[1:30:42] Woo. Whatever he tells you to do. You
[1:30:46] just do what he says and you'll be all
[1:30:48] right.
[1:30:50] I believe her voice in that scripture is
[1:30:52] ringing out right now. And she would cry
[1:30:55] out to this world and say, "Don't look
[1:30:57] to me. You go to him. Whatever he tells
[1:31:00] you to do, you do that. Uh, I don't
[1:31:02] believe her statues are crying and I
[1:31:05] don't believe they're bleeding and I
[1:31:06] don't believe in all of the things that
[1:31:09] they're doing and saying about Mary and
[1:31:12] you be careful because it's pagan.
[1:31:15] It's dangerous.
[1:31:17] And we are thankful for truth that sets
[1:31:20] us free. But I am thankful for her.
[1:31:24] I am a little little girl, little Jewish
[1:31:27] girl who risked so much, who dared to
[1:31:31] stand against society because God chose
[1:31:35] her of all the little maidens. 700 years
[1:31:38] Isaiah prophesied a virgin will come
[1:31:42] forth and will will do great things will
[1:31:45] carry this uh coming savior to
[1:31:49] paraphrase. 700 years went by. Brother
[1:31:52] Brandham said every generation there
[1:31:54] were Jewish maidens knitting little
[1:31:56] booties believing this is the one. This
[1:31:59] is the time. This is the generation.
[1:32:01] Maybe I'm the one. Well, that's the way
[1:32:04] to look for it. 700 years later, here
[1:32:08] come that little Jewish girl, Miriam.
[1:32:11] And uh the Holy Ghost came and
[1:32:13] overshadowed her. The angel spoke over
[1:32:16] here to Yoseph and told him what was
[1:32:19] about to take place. He would seek to
[1:32:23] put her away when he found out that she
[1:32:25] was carrying this child. But when a when
[1:32:28] an angel of God comes and says, "Don't
[1:32:30] you do it." You better obey. Amen. We
[1:32:34] know the rest of the story. They had to
[1:32:36] take that little child uh into Egypt for
[1:32:38] a time and and oh my what a story of
[1:32:42] redemption we have. Now, Chevote is a
[1:32:46] biblical feast and uh we are not
[1:32:50] legalist and this is not something that
[1:32:52] we uh would say we try to keep it but we
[1:32:56] do try to remember it and to commemorate
[1:32:59] it because two powerful expressions of
[1:33:02] God's fire took place on Shàuote Sivon 6
[1:33:08] on the Hebrew calendar.
[1:33:11] Now, lest you misunderstand where we're
[1:33:14] going. We're going somewhere. But lest
[1:33:16] you
[1:33:17] misunderstand, uh maybe you're
[1:33:19] streaming. That's why I have the
[1:33:20] computer here. People wonder sometime
[1:33:23] what what are you doing? You know, I'm
[1:33:24] I'm looking just to see because
[1:33:26] sometimes a message will come through.
[1:33:29] We have a host of people streaming on
[1:33:31] the app, on YouTube, on Facebook, and
[1:33:34] these are many times people who have no
[1:33:36] church and no fellowship, and they're
[1:33:39] joined with us. and we pray over their
[1:33:42] needs when God brings them to our
[1:33:44] attention. Unless you misunderstand that
[1:33:47] we're trying to make somebody Jewish,
[1:33:49] I'll run this little disclaimer today
[1:33:52] again and give you what Jesus said. All
[1:33:55] red letters. All right. Matthew 5 verse
[1:33:59] 17 and 18. He said, "Thank not, red
[1:34:02] letter, think not that I am come to
[1:34:06] destroy the law or the prophets.
[1:34:09] I am not come to destroy but to
[1:34:15] fulfill. I recently read where a
[1:34:18] theologian said it's inaccurate to say
[1:34:20] that Jesus fulfilled. I'm just going to
[1:34:23] say what Jesus said. All
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:26] right. He said when you say that it it
[1:34:29] looks like there'll be no future
[1:34:31] installment. I didn't say Jesus didn't
[1:34:33] say I didn't say there won't be future
[1:34:36] installments.
[1:34:37] There won't be other things that will
[1:34:40] happen that will bring closure and
[1:34:42] fullness to the feast. But if Jesus
[1:34:46] said, "I fulfill them."
[1:34:49] Then I'm going to take him at his word.
[1:34:52] He said, "For verily I say unto you,
[1:34:55] till heaven and earth pass, one jot or
[1:34:59] one tit shall in no wise pass from the
[1:35:04] law till all be fulfilled." Now when we
[1:35:09] look at those words in the original
[1:35:12] context, we look at the word destroy. It
[1:35:16] comes from a Greek word that means to
[1:35:19] disintegrate, to demolish, either
[1:35:22] literally or figuratively. To dissolve,
[1:35:24] to come to not, to overthrow. Jesus
[1:35:27] said, "Don't you think that I have come
[1:35:29] to demolish the law or the prophets? I
[1:35:32] didn't come to dissolve the law or the
[1:35:35] prophets. I didn't come to overthrow
[1:35:37] them or to throw them down, but rather I
[1:35:40] came to fulfill them." So, take a glance
[1:35:43] at what fulfill means. It means to make
[1:35:47] replete. It means to make full, to
[1:35:51] satisfy, to execute, to finish a task,
[1:35:56] to accomplish, to end, expire, to fill
[1:36:01] up, to fulfill, to fill until it's full.
[1:36:06] How many of you got that? So we look at
[1:36:10] the feast because we believe they are
[1:36:12] there to remind us every year as dress
[1:36:18] rehearsals. That's what the word uh moed
[1:36:22] means. A dress rehearsal, a run through.
[1:36:26] You're running through it. You're
[1:36:28] rehearsing it. You're remembering it.
[1:36:31] You're getting great benefit from it
[1:36:35] until one day you'll see all the
[1:36:39] fullness, all the fulfillment when you
[1:36:42] are with Messiah in his kingdom. You'll
[1:36:44] know it all then. He unveils himself to
[1:36:48] us, revealing more of who he is even
[1:36:53] throughout all eternity. I'm telling
[1:36:55] you, that's a God I want to keep
[1:36:57] serving. one who is so multiaceted, full
[1:37:00] of wisdom and grace and truth that it
[1:37:03] would take him all eternity, hallelujah,
[1:37:07] to teach us of his ways. The Bible says
[1:37:11] we will sit together at his feet and
[1:37:15] learn. I would think that he would be
[1:37:17] the best teacher of them all. We will
[1:37:20] learn of who he is. And somebody said,
[1:37:24] "My mind can't even imagine that much."
[1:37:27] Well, that is the reality. He He is a
[1:37:30] great big God worthy of all praise,
[1:37:33] worthy of our lives. Amen. To give him
[1:37:37] everything. We ought to give him
[1:37:38] everything we have. We ought to
[1:37:40] surrender fully to him. We ought to go
[1:37:42] back to the absolute. We ought to be
[1:37:45] willing to purge our lives of things
[1:37:48] that don't line up with that word. Are
[1:37:51] you here? Are you sure? Then we'll move
[1:37:54] on.
[1:37:56] We have seen a progressive fulfillment
[1:37:59] already this spring as we have looked
[1:38:03] again at the
[1:38:05] feast. Sometimes we go several years
[1:38:08] where we will only just mention briefly
[1:38:11] this is the time two or three
[1:38:14] paragraphs. This is what it has meant.
[1:38:16] But this spring we took extra time on
[1:38:21] Passover. We took extra time on the
[1:38:24] feast of first fruits and I believe it
[1:38:26] helps us because it gets us ready for
[1:38:30] whatever God will do among us in the
[1:38:32] fall because we'll go through those
[1:38:34] feasts again as well. And we'll enjoy
[1:38:37] knowing that Jesus didn't come to do
[1:38:40] away with them. He didn't come to give
[1:38:42] them only to the Jews. He came so that
[1:38:45] we might understand the fullness of who
[1:38:48] he is. Jesus fulfilled Passover. I think
[1:38:52] I might have given you that. He
[1:38:54] fulfilled Passover as our spotless
[1:38:57] sacrificial lamb. And the saint said, he
[1:39:01] fulfilled the feast of unleavened bread
[1:39:04] as our purity without leaven means pure
[1:39:09] representing the sinless matzah or what
[1:39:12] we would call the unleavened bread. But
[1:39:14] the Hebrew word there is matzah or matot
[1:39:18] whose life, death, burial, and sacrifice
[1:39:22] cleanse us from all of the leaven of
[1:39:25] sin. Thanks be to God. We can't cleanse
[1:39:29] ourselves. We can't get good enough. We
[1:39:32] can't get holy enough. Doesn't matter
[1:39:35] how long your skirt is. Doesn't matter
[1:39:38] these things. You can't do enough. I
[1:39:41] mean, it matters.
[1:39:43] Don't misunderstand.
[1:39:45] It does matter. Modesty matters.
[1:39:48] Holiness and separation matters. But
[1:39:51] what I mean is it's not the uniform that
[1:39:54] saves us.
[1:39:57] It's not our wardrobe that saves us.
[1:40:00] We're saved by grace
[1:40:03] through the blood of a sinless, spotless
[1:40:06] sacrifice.
[1:40:07] Amen. Amen. Without that, you can look
[1:40:10] the part
[1:40:14] and not have the life and be lost. Don't
[1:40:18] you think for one moment there won't be
[1:40:20] people miss this who look the part.
[1:40:25] There'll be some people who miss this
[1:40:26] because they refuse to look the part.
[1:40:29] But you just understand always that your
[1:40:33] works and your doing and your following
[1:40:37] is not what gives you eternal life. It
[1:40:40] has to be from the absolute.
[1:40:45] It's not believing a
[1:40:47] prophet. It's not attending a particular
[1:40:50] church.
[1:40:53] I'm going to preach anyway.
[1:40:56] It's through grace. through blood. So he
[1:41:00] fulfilled Passover as a spotless
[1:41:03] sacrificial lamb. He fulfilled the whole
[1:41:05] feast of unleavened bread as our purity
[1:41:08] reminding us that he has come to give us
[1:41:11] a life free from all of sin's leaven.
[1:41:14] You can live a life without unbelief. I
[1:41:17] want you to help me. Do you understand?
[1:41:20] You can live a life without unbelief.
[1:41:23] You need to know what you believe and
[1:41:25] you need to believe what you believe.
[1:41:26] Amen. You can know without unbelief.
[1:41:30] It's possible. It It's possible and it's
[1:41:33] probable for those who absolutely seek
[1:41:37] total deliverance. There is total
[1:41:40] deliverance available.
[1:41:42] You don't have to be bound by a thought
[1:41:44] pattern. You don't have to be bound by
[1:41:46] habit. You don't have to be bound by
[1:41:48] generational curse or some kind of
[1:41:51] generational iniquity. You can be free
[1:41:54] today. You can be free tomorrow.
[1:41:57] You can be free next year. Because the
[1:42:00] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:42:03] is enough.
[1:42:05] Amen. Hallelujah. He also fulfilled the
[1:42:08] feast of first fruits as our risen
[1:42:12] savior. Thank God he did. Conquering
[1:42:15] death, hell, and the grave.
[1:42:18] At the very same time that the priest
[1:42:21] would have been out in the field
[1:42:22] gathering barley together into sheav and
[1:42:26] waving those barley sheav before the
[1:42:30] Lord h as a first fruit offering unto
[1:42:34] God. At that very
[1:42:36] moment had already risen from the dead
[1:42:41] and was finishing his 40-day work.
[1:42:47] He had 40 more days of doing to do.
[1:42:52] Hallelujah. I'm thankful. Perfect
[1:42:55] timing. Died at the precise moment that
[1:43:00] the lambs were dying for Passover. The
[1:43:03] lamb. The lamb. The lamb of
[1:43:06] God.
[1:43:07] Hallelujah. The one that Abraham saw in
[1:43:11] the
[1:43:12] Amida in Genesis. We read the story last
[1:43:17] Sunday
[1:43:18] morning. Uh Ezekiel, I believe, or was
[1:43:21] it Isaiah? Maybe it was Isaiah. He saw
[1:43:25] uh back there. What was it? How did that
[1:43:28] happen,
[1:43:29] Joshua? That he that he saw about uh
[1:43:33] Abraham. There's a picture.
[1:43:36] Yes. There's a little small picture
[1:43:38] there on the bookshelf. And Isaiah saw
[1:43:41] it and he wanted to know what's what's
[1:43:43] happening here. And and Jose, I said,
[1:43:46] "Well, papap will tell you." I mean,
[1:43:49] Joshua said, "Pap will tell you." So, I
[1:43:51] began to explain it to him. Then, I
[1:43:53] brought him out here and I said,
[1:43:54] "Haven't you ever noticed this little
[1:43:56] statue that sits here on Pap's
[1:43:58] table?" And and he didn't, you know, how
[1:44:02] little ones are. He didn't hardly notice
[1:44:05] it. This isn't an idol. This is a
[1:44:08] reminder. Well, it's heavy.
[1:44:10] Great day in the morning. That's
[1:44:12] Jerusalem stone it's sitting
[1:44:14] on. And I know the artist who did this.
[1:44:18] And I showed Isaiah the different parts.
[1:44:21] Here is Isa. Here is
[1:44:23] Isaac. That's a lot of names I'm getting
[1:44:25] into
[1:44:26] here. Isaac here. There's a knife toward
[1:44:30] his
[1:44:31] throat. This is his father. This isn't a
[1:44:35] murderer. It's not someone who hates
[1:44:37] him. This is someone who loves him, who
[1:44:40] waited on him, who believed, hoped
[1:44:43] against hope for the promise that Isaiah
[1:44:46] was going to be to him. And this is an
[1:44:49] angel here with
[1:44:52] with a
[1:44:54] ram with a
[1:44:56] lamb. This is called in Hebrew the
[1:44:59] Amida. And that does swing like that.
[1:45:04] The reason why it means he lifted up his
[1:45:07] eyes. Hallelujah. We remember this at
[1:45:10] Shabot. It's one of the times we talk
[1:45:13] about it. It means that he lifted.
[1:45:15] Hallelujah.
[1:45:18] I can't help myself. Hallelujah.
[1:45:22] The New Testament tells us Abraham did
[1:45:24] what he did because he knew
[1:45:27] that even if his son would die that day
[1:45:30] on the mountain, the same God who
[1:45:33] required his death
[1:45:36] had power glory had power to raise him
[1:45:41] up again. Praise the Lord.
[1:45:45] In Jewish tradition, uh we we think of
[1:45:48] him as a little lad, a little small boy.
[1:45:50] But that word lad can mean a lot more in
[1:45:53] Hebrew than it does in English. We
[1:45:56] almost think of a toddler. Some have
[1:45:59] supposed that he was 12 years old or
[1:46:01] such. But there is a lot of thought in
[1:46:05] Jewish study that he was a man of over
[1:46:09] 18.
[1:46:12] And somebody said, "I just can't hardly
[1:46:14] imagine that." Well, if it's true, if
[1:46:17] there's any truth to it at all, I want
[1:46:19] you to know that Abraham is not the only
[1:46:22] hero.
[1:46:25] That would pretty much make Isaac a
[1:46:26] hero, too, wouldn't it? Because by now,
[1:46:30] when we read it, we say, "The poor
[1:46:32] little fella didn't know what was going
[1:46:33] on." And he might not have if he was a
[1:46:35] toddler, but if he was a little bit
[1:46:37] older, he knew exactly what was going on
[1:46:40] when his father had to bind him and put
[1:46:42] him there. But here's the glorious
[1:46:44] thought. He lifted up his eyes and a far
[1:46:49] off. The scripture said he saw something
[1:46:52] that day that wasn't there in the
[1:46:56] natural. For we know that Mount Moria
[1:46:59] Mariah is the place where the temple
[1:47:02] would one day sit. It's the place of the
[1:47:05] crucifixion, the sacrifice would take
[1:47:08] place in sight of Mount Mariah. The
[1:47:12] scripture indicates through through this
[1:47:15] Hebrew language that he looked up and
[1:47:17] caught a glimpse of a day that another
[1:47:20] lamb would come, another ram would be
[1:47:23] provided. Hallelujah. to take the place
[1:47:25] of not only one Isaac, one son, but of
[1:47:29] of the whole world if they can believe.
[1:47:34] Hallelujah.
[1:47:36] And that's
[1:47:37] why Jesus said to the Jews who were
[1:47:40] giving him a hard time, the
[1:47:42] Pharisees, that's why he said that
[1:47:45] day, Abraham, your father, saw my day
[1:47:50] and rejoiced.
[1:47:54] It's because God gave him a
[1:47:57] glimpse.
[1:47:59] Hallelujah. And we think of that during
[1:48:02] this time of
[1:48:05] shàuote or what the church likes to call
[1:48:09] Pentecost. So as believers, we're not
[1:48:12] trying to keep the feast. We're trying
[1:48:15] to pull from them every part of Jesus.
[1:48:22] He fulfills every part. He shines his
[1:48:26] loving light on every part. If I had a
[1:48:29] title for this this morning, I would
[1:48:31] call it Jesus, our shàot, the mountain,
[1:48:35] the fire, and the fence.
[1:48:38] In Leviticus chap 23
[1:48:41] uh verse 15-1 17 it says and you shall
[1:48:44] count unto you from the tomorrow after
[1:48:46] the Sabbath from the day that you
[1:48:49] brought the sheath of the wave offering
[1:48:51] which was first fruits that was a barley
[1:48:54] offering seven Sabbaths shall be
[1:48:58] complete. Now remember it was the day
[1:49:01] after the Sabbath which we would call
[1:49:04] Sunday that the feast of first fruits
[1:49:06] took place. It was on that day that our
[1:49:09] Lord resurrected, we believe that in our
[1:49:12] way of keeping time, it would have been
[1:49:15] as the sun was going down. But as the uh
[1:49:19] Gregorian time, well, they like to talk
[1:49:22] about it being as the sun is coming up
[1:49:24] because their days start at sunrise. The
[1:49:27] biblical day starts at sunset. When the
[1:49:30] sun goes down, a new day has already
[1:49:32] begun. And so the scripture was clear in
[1:49:36] in Leviticus and in numbers also. I want
[1:49:40] you from the day of the feast of first
[1:49:42] fruits count. Seven Sabbath
[1:49:45] days. 7* 7 is
[1:49:49] what? And
[1:49:50] one is 50. That's why it's called feast
[1:49:55] of weeks is because seven weeks were to
[1:49:59] be counted in the
[1:50:01] omr in the measurement of the harvest.
[1:50:04] Every day counted with
[1:50:07] anticipation because we have seen the
[1:50:10] barley harvest and now we are
[1:50:13] anticipating for the wheat harvest. of
[1:50:17] the two, which would you say would be of
[1:50:19] more importance agriculturally to
[1:50:22] Israel? The wheat harvest, because wheat
[1:50:25] would be used in so many different ways.
[1:50:28] But barley was the beginning of the
[1:50:32] harvest for the agricultural year. And
[1:50:35] so it was with great anticipation they
[1:50:39] counted every day knowing that 49 days
[1:50:43] would pass and then on the day after
[1:50:45] there would be another first fruit
[1:50:47] offering. And this one would look
[1:50:49] different than the one that was offered
[1:50:52] on the day that our Lord resurrected
[1:50:54] from the dead. That day it was ripened
[1:50:57] sheav of barley. But on this day it
[1:51:01] would be a little different. Let's read.
[1:51:02] even unto the tomorrow. After the
[1:51:05] seventh Sabbath shall ye number 50 days,
[1:51:08] and ye shall offer a new meat offering
[1:51:11] unto the Lord. Ye shall bring out of
[1:51:15] your
[1:51:16] habitations two wave loaves of two tenth
[1:51:21] deals. They shall be
[1:51:24] of help, fine flour, which requires
[1:51:28] wheat. They shall be
[1:51:31] bacon. That's not
[1:51:38] bacon. That's baking in the oven, not on
[1:51:43] the pig. They shall be bacon with
[1:51:46] leaven. They are they are these loaves
[1:51:50] of bread. Two loaves of bread. And there
[1:51:53] all you people are running away from
[1:51:56] bread.
[1:52:01] No bun, please. I'm insulted when they
[1:52:04] ask me somewhere. I am, "Is that on a
[1:52:07] bun?" You better bet it is on a
[1:52:10] bun. I'll have my leaves in my salad.
[1:52:14] But on my burger, I want wheat. Give me
[1:52:18] a bun. Two wave
[1:52:21] loaves. Every household brings them. and
[1:52:25] they stand in the presence of the Lord.
[1:52:28] Some of you folks who are so reserved
[1:52:30] and refined and uh cold, formal, if if
[1:52:35] there are any like that maybe out there,
[1:52:39] uh you'd have a hard time. You who like
[1:52:42] to call yourself an introvert, you'd
[1:52:45] have a hard time because every house had
[1:52:47] to do this and every house had to wave
[1:52:50] these things. Can you imagine coming out
[1:52:52] into the presence of the Lord and waving
[1:52:54] these two loaves of bread? Can you
[1:52:57] imagine you've got you've got two loaves
[1:52:59] of uh uh colonial bread, so to speak,
[1:53:02] and you're waving it out there before
[1:53:05] the Lord. The Lord commanded it. That's
[1:53:07] right. He said, "Because this is the
[1:53:09] first fruit offering of the wheat
[1:53:11] harvest that is about to take place, and
[1:53:14] this will be a sign. This will be a
[1:53:18] covenant for you in later days. And so
[1:53:22] there's so much here that we don't have
[1:53:25] time to hit, but I think I have some of
[1:53:28] this for you. The word shaveot, also
[1:53:31] spelled with some different spellings,
[1:53:34] is a Hebrew term that literally means
[1:53:36] weeks or it can also mean sevens. It
[1:53:41] derives from the Hebrew root word and
[1:53:45] that that root word there is I don't
[1:53:48] know there's some missing letters there.
[1:53:50] Shàuoah
[1:53:52] uh if you are in Israel they will wish
[1:53:55] you a happy week. Shavoa is a modern
[1:54:00] Hebrew word that is used for weak and
[1:54:04] it's also related to the Hebrew number
[1:54:07] seven Shiva or Cheva. The plural form of
[1:54:13] week is shàuote and that's why we call
[1:54:17] the feast shàot. It's the feast of
[1:54:20] weeks. One of the three biblical
[1:54:22] pilgrimage festivals that are mentioned
[1:54:25] in the Torah in the scripture, you know
[1:54:27] them as Passover, Shàuo or Pesak,
[1:54:31] Shàuote, and Sakote. We could say
[1:54:35] Passover, Pentecost, and
[1:54:38] tabernacles. The scripture is uh careful
[1:54:42] to explain some of this counting. And I
[1:54:45] don't want to take the time. I've got to
[1:54:46] go somewhere. But I would like to read
[1:54:48] you one thing from this Psalm 67.
[1:54:52] Because every year this evening, every
[1:54:56] observant Hebrew will recite the verses
[1:55:01] of Psalm 67. And they'll they'll do that
[1:55:05] because of the 49 words that make up
[1:55:10] this psalm. In fact, this psalm is
[1:55:13] prayed every day for 49 days. When the
[1:55:17] OMR is counted to prepare for the coming
[1:55:20] of the wheat harvest, God be merciful
[1:55:24] unto us and bless us and cause his face
[1:55:29] to shine upon us. Sila, pause and think
[1:55:34] on these things that thy way may be
[1:55:39] known upon earth, thy saving health
[1:55:42] among all nations. Let the people praise
[1:55:45] thee, oh God. Let all the people praise
[1:55:49] thee. Are you here? Oh, let the nations
[1:55:53] be glad and sing for joy, for thou shalt
[1:55:57] judge the people righteously, and govern
[1:56:00] the nations upon the earth. Sila, pause
[1:56:04] and think on these things. Let the
[1:56:07] people praise thee, oh God. Let all the
[1:56:11] people praise thee. Can somebody say
[1:56:14] amen? Amen. Then shall the earth yield
[1:56:18] her increase and God, even our own God
[1:56:23] shall bless us. God shall bless us and
[1:56:28] all the ends of the earth shall fear
[1:56:31] him. If you got a garden, this is a good
[1:56:34] prayer to pray over your garden because
[1:56:37] it is be thanking God for what has
[1:56:40] already sprung forth from the earth as
[1:56:43] provision and what will later spring
[1:56:46] forth into maturity as provision. 49
[1:56:50] words and therefore it is recited prayed
[1:56:54] not recited prayed as a prayer to God
[1:56:57] every day when counting down those 49
[1:57:00] days 7* 7 seven Sabbaths this feast is a
[1:57:05] divine countdown from redemption to
[1:57:10] revelation to revival because it has a
[1:57:14] New Testament fulfillment as well. We'll
[1:57:16] get to that in a moment. Two loaves are
[1:57:19] waved before the Lord reminding us of
[1:57:22] Jew and Gentile.
[1:57:27] You remember God made a way so that
[1:57:31] Gentiles could hear the word. Aren't you
[1:57:35] glad and believe? It speaks to us of
[1:57:39] both Jews and Gentiles being accepted by
[1:57:43] what we have who we have called Jehovah
[1:57:46] or Yahweh. It speaks of a unified church
[1:57:51] made up of redeemed individuals who are
[1:57:55] Jewish and who are gentile. Ephesians
[1:58:00] chapter 2, let's look at it. Verse 14
[1:58:03] and 15. For he is our peace. Amen. Who
[1:58:07] hath made both one.
[1:58:11] Somebody maybe some child will help me.
[1:58:13] Some teenager help me. Somebody hold up
[1:58:16] for one. He had made us both.
[1:58:21] Two have become one and hath broken down
[1:58:26] the middle wall of partition between us.
[1:58:30] Ephesians promises a church that will
[1:58:33] not be Jewish,
[1:58:37] that will not be Gentile, but a church
[1:58:41] made up of one new man, both Jew and
[1:58:46] Gentile, grafted in to the same life.
[1:58:50] The same life. If you read Romans 11,
[1:58:53] the same life, that same vine that gives
[1:58:56] life to the branches for the Jews is the
[1:59:00] same life that gives life to the
[1:59:04] branches for the Gentiles. They have
[1:59:07] been grafted in. As the Apostle Paul
[1:59:11] tells us, this is powerful to remember.
[1:59:14] Not just this time of year, but every
[1:59:16] time of year. Amen. Amen. I'm going to
[1:59:20] get through this.
[1:59:22] James 1:18. Of his own will begat he us
[1:59:28] with the word of truth that
[1:59:32] we not a barley sheave, not two loaves
[1:59:36] of wheat bread, but of his own will he
[1:59:39] begat us with a word of truth that we
[1:59:43] should be a kind of first fruits of his
[1:59:47] creatures. Oh, hallelujah. And he proved
[1:59:50] that on another shave oat.
[1:59:55] I believe we call it the day of
[1:59:57] Pentecost.
[1:59:58] He proved it. He said, "I'm going to do
[2:00:01] it
[2:00:02] again." And even now, he'll do it again.
[2:00:06] There's one baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:08] There are many refillings of the Holy
[2:00:10] Ghost. Who'd like to have one today?
[2:00:13] Well, you better get in here then
[2:00:15] because there's one for you. That's
[2:00:17] right. There's one for you. It's not
[2:00:19] about qualifying. It's about believing.
[2:00:22] It's about positioning yourself to
[2:00:24] receive that refilling. And we need it.
[2:00:28] We need it. We need it. We need him.
[2:00:30] We've got to have it. Now, if we look
[2:00:33] quickly, and I know this is foundational
[2:00:36] and it's hard to get through, but are we
[2:00:38] going to get through it? We have to.
[2:00:40] Because I'm not going to give you the
[2:00:42] punch line and not give you what leads
[2:00:45] up to the punch line. I'm going to do
[2:00:46] what Jesus said. I'm going to make sure
[2:00:49] that you understand where you've come
[2:00:51] from. What Paul said, I'm going to make
[2:00:54] sure we understand where we come from.
[2:00:57] It's the grace of God that we could even
[2:01:00] speak of such things. Because unless
[2:01:03] you're Jewish by birth, you you wouldn't
[2:01:05] even be speaking of these things. Had
[2:01:07] not the grace of God come and said, "I'm
[2:01:09] going to bring in other nations. I'm
[2:01:12] going to take them out for my name's
[2:01:13] sake. I'm going to show the whole world
[2:01:15] what a savior I am. I'm going to save
[2:01:18] both the elect.
[2:01:20] In fact, I'm going to find an elect in
[2:01:23] both people groups. Are you here?
[2:01:27] Exodus
[2:01:28] 199 and the and 15. And the Lord said
[2:01:31] unto Moses, Lo, I come unto thee in a
[2:01:34] quick cloud, thick cloud, that the
[2:01:36] people may hear when I speak with thee
[2:01:39] and believe thee forever. And Moses told
[2:01:42] the words of the people unto the Lord.
[2:01:45] And the Lord said unto Moses, "Go unto
[2:01:47] the people and sanctify them today and
[2:01:52] tomorrow, and let them wash their
[2:01:55] clothes, and be ready against the third
[2:01:59] day. For the third day the Lord will
[2:02:04] come down. Think of this. In the sight
[2:02:08] of all the people upon Mount Si. Is that
[2:02:12] what it says? And thou shalt set bounds.
[2:02:15] We read this. Unto the people
[2:02:17] roundabout, saying, Take heed to
[2:02:19] yourselves that you go not up into the
[2:02:21] mount or touch the border. For whosoever
[2:02:24] toucheth the mount shall be surely put
[2:02:26] to death. There shall not a hand touch
[2:02:29] it, but he shall surely be stoned or
[2:02:31] shot through, whether it be beast or
[2:02:34] man, it shall not live. When the trumpet
[2:02:36] sounds long, they shall come up to the
[2:02:40] mountain to the mount. And Moses went
[2:02:42] down from the mount uh to the people and
[2:02:46] sanctified the people, told them, "Set
[2:02:50] yourselves apart." They washed their
[2:02:53] clothes. Do you hear this? This is a
[2:02:56] type of both baptism
[2:02:59] and sanctification.
[2:03:03] Praise God that he washes us in the
[2:03:06] water of his word. Sanctified by the
[2:03:11] washing of the water of his word. He
[2:03:13] said unto the people, "Be ready." What a
[2:03:16] cry. Be ready against the third day.
[2:03:19] Come not at your wives. There is a time
[2:03:24] for that fellowship. There's a time for
[2:03:27] that coming together. But for three
[2:03:29] days, we are sanctified unto the Lord
[2:03:32] because the Lord is about to come down
[2:03:34] on that mountain and tell us why he came
[2:03:36] and got us in Egypt.
[2:03:39] He's about to tell us that there are
[2:03:42] some requirements that he's going to
[2:03:44] make of us. If we want to go into that
[2:03:46] promised land, we're going to have to
[2:03:47] follow some truths.
[2:03:50] And so we should prepare ourselves for
[2:03:53] the coming glory. And that means wash
[2:03:56] our clothes and keep ourselves clean and
[2:04:00] pure because God's about to do
[2:04:02] something. May you hear that? I have
[2:04:05] tried to hear it and I pray you also
[2:04:08] will. It came to pass on the third day.
[2:04:11] We're reading on in the morning. Listen,
[2:04:15] God knows how to put on a show.
[2:04:18] And when I say show, you know I don't
[2:04:19] mean that disrespectfully. He knows how
[2:04:22] to show out
[2:04:24] in the morning that there were thunders
[2:04:27] and
[2:04:28] lightnings and a thick cloud upon the
[2:04:30] mount and the voice of the
[2:04:33] trumpet exceeding loud so that all the
[2:04:37] people that was in the
[2:04:40] camp
[2:04:41] Hello, read it, trembled.
[2:04:46] I want you to know they reverenced what
[2:04:48] they heard. This sounds
[2:04:51] serious. This is not a staccato blast.
[2:04:56] This is a long blast. I'm telling you,
[2:05:00] it exceeded all other
[2:05:02] blast. What is God trying to say? Here
[2:05:06] is a blast like we have never heard
[2:05:09] before. And all the people in the camp
[2:05:12] trembled. And Moses brought forth the
[2:05:14] people out of the camp. listen to meet
[2:05:16] with
[2:05:18] God. And they stood at the nether part
[2:05:22] of the mount. I wonder
[2:05:25] why. Because God had already warned them
[2:05:28] through the prophet. Don't get too
[2:05:30] close. Fences had already been
[2:05:33] erected. Why were there fences? God was
[2:05:36] saying, "This is holy." That's right.
[2:05:40] Fools walk with hobnailed shoes where
[2:05:45] angels fear to trod. Do you understand?
[2:05:48] The church of today leaves no room for
[2:05:51] anything to be san sanctified or uh uh
[2:05:54] uh sacred.
[2:05:59] They wear their baseball caps, their
[2:06:01] cargo shorts, and they come in and sit
[2:06:04] right down on the front row. Hello
[2:06:09] I mean, you know, the same guy perhaps
[2:06:12] goes to mama's house for chicken dinner
[2:06:15] and takes his hat off because he knows
[2:06:16] mama swat him upside the head if he
[2:06:19] doesn't. But marches into the church
[2:06:22] like that with no one to even
[2:06:26] explain. It's not that you're going to
[2:06:28] be struck dead. It's not any of that.
[2:06:31] Not today. But it's just learning a
[2:06:35] protocol.
[2:06:36] This is not our living room. This is not
[2:06:39] our fellowship hall. This is where we
[2:06:42] come to meet with God.
[2:06:45] We're his house. This is where his
[2:06:47] houses come to meet him. Do you
[2:06:50] understand? And so that we don't want to
[2:06:52] come in here uh with some kind of sloppy
[2:06:56] way. We want to be as careful as we
[2:06:58] possibly can. They heard in that day God
[2:07:02] said, "You get too close to the
[2:07:03] mountain, zap. You're gone. You're
[2:07:05] finished. Mount Si was all together on a
[2:07:09] smoke because the Lord the Lord
[2:07:13] descended upon it. I need you to tell me
[2:07:17] how.
[2:07:19] In
[2:07:20] fire. This is the eternal spirit of
[2:07:24] God who has no fleshly physical body
[2:07:28] until he came in the sun through Jesus
[2:07:31] Christ. Here he comes in a fire on the
[2:07:34] top of the mountain. Don't you think for
[2:07:35] one moment that it wasn't God? That was
[2:07:38] God.
[2:07:40] Did he have a nose? That was God. Did
[2:07:44] Did he have two ears? It was fire.
[2:07:48] It was God. That's right.
[2:07:53] Just like that pillar of fire that would
[2:07:56] lead them on, that was God.
[2:07:59] That cloud by day, that was God. Do you
[2:08:03] understand?
[2:08:05] Smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a
[2:08:07] furnace. And the whole mountain
[2:08:11] quakdly, I'd call that an earthquake.
[2:08:13] And when the voice of the trumpet
[2:08:15] sounded long, and not only long, but it
[2:08:18] waxed louder and louder, Moses spake and
[2:08:22] God answered
[2:08:24] him by a voice. How could it be a voice
[2:08:27] if there wasn't a man involved? Because
[2:08:29] God has a voice. He had a voice before
[2:08:31] he had a physical body.
[2:08:34] He's an eternal spirit, but he has a
[2:08:37] voice. And he spoke to them. God
[2:08:40] answered Moses by a voice. Is that what
[2:08:44] he said? I'm thankful for that. God
[2:08:47] began to unfold the instruction or the
[2:08:51] teaching. That's what's represented here
[2:08:53] in that scroll that you see that causes
[2:08:56] us so many problems.
[2:09:00] Some people get so
[2:09:03] upset that there is a scroll there. You
[2:09:06] know
[2:09:07] what? I don't care. That's right.
[2:09:12] That is It's a real scroll, by the way.
[2:09:15] It's no longer uh considered kosher
[2:09:19] because of of some damage and some uh
[2:09:23] repairs, but it's
[2:09:25] sheepkin. And you that haven't seen it,
[2:09:28] some of you haven't seen it. I'll be
[2:09:29] glad sometime to uh undress the scroll
[2:09:32] for you and let you look at it, let you
[2:09:33] see it. Hand, every
[2:09:37] every jot and
[2:09:39] tit, every letter in it handwritten by a
[2:09:43] scribe. If he makes one mistake, the
[2:09:46] whole
[2:09:47] page has to be unsoed from the others
[2:09:51] and destroyed and he starts over. I
[2:09:54] remember those kind of things in school.
[2:09:56] Can you imagine getting to the last
[2:10:01] word and and and
[2:10:04] dropping something on it
[2:10:08] or making the wrong number like you do
[2:10:11] sometime when the year changes and you
[2:10:14] antique people like me who still write
[2:10:15] checks, you put 2024 instead of 2025 and
[2:10:19] the whole thing be ruined.
[2:10:21] That particular scroll was carried out
[2:10:24] by a Jewish family that I had the
[2:10:26] privilege of meeting one of the
[2:10:29] descendants and they brought it all the
[2:10:31] way from Iran or Iraq from that part of
[2:10:35] the world and walked
[2:10:37] it to Jerusalem. I'd have to check my
[2:10:40] notes to see exactly how far and from
[2:10:44] which of those two countries. I have
[2:10:46] forgotten now through the years.
[2:10:49] uh Iran I think
[2:10:51] perhaps but I don't recall they were
[2:10:54] being pushed out of their country many
[2:10:57] years ago and they said the only place
[2:10:59] for us to have peace imagine that is
[2:11:03] Israel. So they walk, they start walking
[2:11:06] and they walk and they walk and they
[2:11:07] walk and they walk until they arrive.
[2:11:09] And the only thing they bring with them
[2:11:11] is a few provisions and a scroll that
[2:11:14] had been dedicated to the memory of
[2:11:16] their family, one of their ancestors,
[2:11:18] their family. And it's there not as
[2:11:21] some, you know, holy uh thing, but it is
[2:11:24] holy because the Bible is holy. And
[2:11:27] that's the first five books of the
[2:11:29] Bible. And and you just think about God
[2:11:32] is giving
[2:11:33] that now
[2:11:35] shaveote. This is not only the
[2:11:38] commemoration of a wheat harvest and
[2:11:40] some loaves being weighed, but we
[2:11:42] remember that this was the day, the
[2:11:44] exact day as we enter into Shàuote that
[2:11:47] this fire came down and this smoke
[2:11:50] filled up the mountain and God said,
[2:11:52] "Put a fence around it. Make a border
[2:11:54] around it." All of these things, the
[2:11:56] mountain is shaking. And when the voice
[2:11:58] of the trumpet sounded long, God speaks
[2:12:01] and answers Moses by a voice. It is the
[2:12:05] giving of the instruction. Thank God.
[2:12:08] That's not all to the Bible, but it's
[2:12:11] the beginning of the Bible. Aren't you
[2:12:13] glad for it? I am. This day as shàuote
[2:12:18] begins 6 would be exactly 50 days since
[2:12:25] Israel crossed the Red Sea. They are
[2:12:29] just at a 50-day jubilee of the greatest
[2:12:32] miracle the Hebrew people have ever seen
[2:12:35] God perform to this point. I want you to
[2:12:38] know they're feeling pretty spiritual
[2:12:40] about now.
[2:12:42] They're pretty confident about the God
[2:12:44] they serve. now. And God said, "I'm
[2:12:47] going to marry my people
[2:12:49] today. This is going to be a marriage
[2:12:52] celebration. It's a marriage covenant.
[2:12:55] I'm giving them the five uh books of
[2:12:58] truth. I'm giving them these
[2:13:00] commandments. I'm giving them these
[2:13:02] instructions as a a a marriage
[2:13:06] contract." In Hebrew, it's called a
[2:13:09] cuba. And it's when a man pledges
[2:13:12] himself with vows to his uh betrothed
[2:13:16] and she pledges herself, her vows, her
[2:13:20] faithfulness to her husband, to her
[2:13:22] soontobe husband, her betro. God said,
[2:13:25] "I'm giving that to all of Israel and to
[2:13:29] those who will come out of the nations.
[2:13:31] And I'm doing it today on the feast of
[2:13:35] first fruits when the wheat is being
[2:13:38] gathered in to provide for the people.
[2:13:41] This was an important time for all of
[2:13:44] Israel. Are you still here? God said,
[2:13:47] "Don't you get too close." This is where
[2:13:49] I I want to go now for a few moments.
[2:13:52] Don't get No one walks into covenant
[2:13:55] glory without preparation.
[2:13:58] Nobody climbs the holy hill of the Lord
[2:14:01] without some holy hands, some clean
[2:14:04] hands, and a purified heart. That's
[2:14:06] right. We got to be careful.
[2:14:23] Because we're
[2:14:25] learning that the fire doesn't
[2:14:27] fall where there are no
[2:14:33] fences. God said, "You're going to make
[2:14:36] a boundary around that mountain. I don't
[2:14:37] want anybody to accidentally fall
[2:14:39] against it."
[2:14:43] God commanded Moses to set a physical
[2:14:46] boundary. Remember what we've been
[2:14:48] preaching about the ancient landmarks.
[2:14:51] This is this is like that. It's the same
[2:14:55] kind of uh boundary that we're not
[2:14:57] supposed to be fooling with. We're
[2:15:00] supposed to leave these things in place
[2:15:02] because God sets them there for a
[2:15:04] reason. so that you and I will know the
[2:15:07] difference between the
[2:15:09] holy and the ordinary.
[2:15:12] It's not just the holy and the profane
[2:15:14] that you've got to learn the difference
[2:15:15] and I have to learn the difference from.
[2:15:16] But it's also the holy and the ordinary.
[2:15:20] Let me tell you something. There are
[2:15:21] some folk in this house that are no
[2:15:24] longer ordinary.
[2:15:28] Because they've heard the word. They've
[2:15:31] repented of their sin and their
[2:15:33] unbelief. They've been baptized in the
[2:15:35] name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Yeshua,
[2:15:37] our Messiah. Come on. They've been
[2:15:39] filled with the Holy Ghost and fire.
[2:15:43] They're no longer ordinary people.
[2:15:45] They're no longer to be treated like
[2:15:47] ordinary people. They're holy people.
[2:15:50] Somebody said, "How can you call people
[2:15:52] that make mistakes holy?" I didn't have
[2:15:54] to do it. God did it.
[2:15:57] And all he had to do was put his fire on
[2:16:00] them.
[2:16:01] You know what I preach about the burning
[2:16:03] bush? Five minutes earlier, that bush
[2:16:06] was an ordinary bush. It didn't look any
[2:16:09] different than any of the rest. But in
[2:16:11] five minutes time, the destiny of that
[2:16:13] bush changed forever. Not because Moses
[2:16:17] happened upon it, but because the fire
[2:16:19] chose it. God said, "I'm going to put
[2:16:22] myself in that bush and I'm going to
[2:16:25] meet my prophet
[2:16:28] and I'm going to give him a sign that
[2:16:30] it's me." The bush will burn, but it
[2:16:32] will not be consumed. And Moses walks up
[2:16:35] there with his dirty feet and sandals.
[2:16:37] And God didn't say, "Go wash your feet.
[2:16:39] Wash your face and clean." He just said,
[2:16:41] "Take off your sandals
[2:16:44] because this is holy ground." Somebody
[2:16:46] said, "Well, it must have been holy
[2:16:47] chosen." Uh uh. No, no, no, no, no.
[2:16:50] Maybe in the mind of God, we could say
[2:16:52] so. But in the natural, no one knew that
[2:16:54] that place was going to be a sacred
[2:16:56] place until God fell on it. I want you
[2:16:59] to know you didn't know.
[2:17:01] You didn't know you were going to be
[2:17:02] more than ordinary.
[2:17:05] You didn't know that God was going to
[2:17:06] choose you the way he chose you and set
[2:17:08] you apart the way he set you apart. And
[2:17:11] the difference is not the rule you keep
[2:17:12] or the church you go to. The difference
[2:17:14] is the fire fell on your life. And when
[2:17:17] the fire of God falls on your life, you
[2:17:20] are no longer ordinary. You become the
[2:17:22] sacred. You become the holy. You become
[2:17:25] a house.
[2:17:27] Yes, Lord. For the spirit of God to live
[2:17:30] in, the very same spirit that was in
[2:17:32] Jesus Christ now is in you. What a gift.
[2:17:36] How should we live? How should we treat
[2:17:38] one another? How should we behave
[2:17:40] ourselves knowing that God
[2:17:46] almighty? Lives inside of us.
[2:17:52] I want you to look at Exodus now 19
[2:17:54] verse1. In the third
[2:17:57] month, when the children of Israel were
[2:17:59] gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the
[2:18:02] same day came they into the wilderness
[2:18:03] of Sinai, for they were departed from
[2:18:06] Refodm, and were come to the desert of
[2:18:08] Sinai, and had pitched in the
[2:18:09] wilderness, and there Israel camp before
[2:18:12] the mount. And Moses went up unto God.
[2:18:14] And the Lord called unto him out of the
[2:18:16] mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to
[2:18:20] the house of Jacob, and tell the
[2:18:22] children of Israel, ye have seen what I
[2:18:26] did unto the Egyptians, and how I bear
[2:18:28] you on eagle's wings, and brought you
[2:18:30] unto myself. That's powerful. Now
[2:18:32] therefore, if you will obey my voice
[2:18:34] indeed and keep my covenant, then you
[2:18:37] shall be a
[2:18:42] secular peculiar
[2:18:44] treasure. The king had a lot of
[2:18:46] treasure, but there was one treasure
[2:18:49] always referred to as seula.
[2:18:52] That was the choice
[2:18:54] choicest, the most valuable, the most
[2:18:57] beloved treasure that belonged in the
[2:19:00] treasury of the king. Perhaps a crown,
[2:19:04] perhaps something else. I don't know the
[2:19:06] kinds of things that were used, but
[2:19:08] whatever he cherished the most was part
[2:19:12] of the treasury, but it was called the
[2:19:14] secular. That word peculiar doesn't mean
[2:19:17] let's see how odd and strange and
[2:19:23] religious. We can
[2:19:27] get every other breath doesn't have to
[2:19:29] be amen. Hallelujah.
[2:19:32] You
[2:19:33] understand? It means exclusively one's
[2:19:37] own.
[2:19:38] I'll make you a peculiar treasure unto
[2:19:43] me above all people. For all the earth
[2:19:46] belongs to me. It's mine. And ye shall
[2:19:50] be unto me. Listen for this is no longer
[2:19:52] just a promise to the Jewish nation.
[2:19:55] This is now a promise to the one new
[2:19:57] man. Not the church replacing Israel,
[2:20:01] but the church grafted into the same
[2:20:03] life. You understand? Ye shall be unto
[2:20:07] me a
[2:20:08] what? Of what?
[2:20:11] Priest, a holy nation. These are the
[2:20:15] words which thou shalt speak unto the
[2:20:18] children of Israel. My my my. And Moses
[2:20:22] came and called for the elders of the
[2:20:24] people and laid before their faces all
[2:20:27] these words which the Lord commanded
[2:20:29] him. One more verse. And all the people
[2:20:31] answered. This is very powerful. This is
[2:20:33] accepting of the
[2:20:35] Cuba. This is the accepting of the
[2:20:38] proposal. God has now
[2:20:40] promised this
[2:20:42] nation of
[2:20:44] refugees. If you will obey my word, if
[2:20:48] you'll live a a peculiar life unto me,
[2:20:52] if you will be separated from other
[2:20:55] nations and obey what I command, I will
[2:21:00] bless you and I will keep you and I will
[2:21:03] provide for you and you'll belong to me
[2:21:06] only. You'll exclusively be my treasure.
[2:21:09] And the people, this is all laid out by
[2:21:11] Moses what the Lord has said. And the
[2:21:14] people answered together and said,
[2:21:16] "Would you answer together and read this
[2:21:18] line for me, please?" All the
[2:21:26] They didn't know all of
[2:21:29] it. They only knew what Moses shared
[2:21:32] with them because the wholeness of the
[2:21:35] covenant had not been given just
[2:21:38] yet. And yet, how did the people answer?
[2:21:41] Well, let us hear it first.
[2:21:43] That's how we would have answered. Now,
[2:21:46] if you can give me uh ju just a a pretty
[2:21:50] good summary, let me decide if I want to
[2:21:53] accept the contract or not, then we can
[2:21:55] move along. No, in fact, they said in
[2:21:59] English, it's translated, all that the
[2:22:02] Lord hath spoken, we will do. And Moses
[2:22:06] returned the words of the people unto
[2:22:08] the Lord. He goes back up and he tells
[2:22:11] the
[2:22:11] Lord what the people have answered. Now
[2:22:15] in Hebrew, it doesn't just say what you
[2:22:18] say will do. In Hebrew, it says
[2:22:21] something more. It says if you directly,
[2:22:24] if you make a direct translation from
[2:22:26] the Hebrew to the English, it would say
[2:22:28] this. We agreed to do even before we
[2:22:34] have listened.
[2:22:38] How can you make such a commitment
[2:22:40] before you even tell us all that you're
[2:22:43] going to require of us? Our answer is
[2:22:45] already yes. Hello.
[2:22:47] Anybody following me where I am?
[2:22:51] Before you tell us all we've already
[2:22:54] said, Lord. Yeah. What would make them
[2:22:57] do such a thing? Let me tell you
[2:22:58] something. Many things.
[2:23:02] Some lice, some frogs,
[2:23:05] some death of the firstborn,
[2:23:10] some pillar of fire come swirling down
[2:23:13] out of the heaven and and and raise up
[2:23:16] the waters of the Red Sea and a whole
[2:23:19] nation of people walk through.
[2:23:21] That's the God that's talking to them.
[2:23:24] They had no reason to doubt that he was
[2:23:27] for them.
[2:23:29] They not only saw God make a way through
[2:23:31] the Red Sea, they saw God turn around
[2:23:34] and drown their enemies.
[2:23:39] Amen. Would this be a good place to
[2:23:42] remind you of the story of the little
[2:23:46] fresh out of cemetery, a seminary
[2:23:50] preacher who got too big for his
[2:23:52] breaches? And he got up in an
[2:23:54] oldfashioned little church of God church
[2:23:57] and he started preaching and he said,
[2:23:59] "Don't you know that doesn't mean red
[2:24:01] sea? It means read sea." And he said,
[2:24:04] "Don't you know that it was only a few
[2:24:06] inches deep at that time of the year?
[2:24:09] the this woman first he's telling the
[2:24:11] story this little grandma with a bun on
[2:24:13] her head she jumps up and starts
[2:24:14] shouting woo
[2:24:17] woo and and he said sister didn't you
[2:24:21] hear
[2:24:22] me he said I I want to say this again
[2:24:25] now here you are jumping around I'm
[2:24:28] telling you there's not like we've
[2:24:29] always
[2:24:30] thought this the the the the Red Sea is
[2:24:33] really the reed sea and it was only a
[2:24:36] few inches deep this time of the year
[2:24:37] later in the It would flood. So, so
[2:24:40] really, you know, it was just like
[2:24:43] walking a nation of people through. I
[2:24:46] mean, why would the pillar of fire have
[2:24:47] to come down and divide 4 inches of
[2:24:50] water, you know, three inches of water?
[2:24:53] Surely the people can get through. I've
[2:24:57] waited through more than that, hadn't
[2:24:58] you? I've waited through more water than
[2:25:01] that down in the heart of Jerusalem, way
[2:25:03] underneath the stone in Hezekiah's
[2:25:05] tunnel. I waited through more than three
[2:25:07] inches of water. I'm a little
[2:25:09] claustrophobic and I I'm bigger than the
[2:25:11] men who were digging that uh tunnel in
[2:25:14] the time of Hezekiah. So, I want you to
[2:25:16] know I'm having a time getting through
[2:25:18] it. And God brought me through. And I
[2:25:22] was all right until some poor brother
[2:25:24] hollered out, "Lord, shake Jerusalem."
[2:25:28] And I said, "If you don't mind, can we
[2:25:30] ask him to shake it when we get out from
[2:25:32] underneath it?"
[2:25:34] Anyway, moving right
[2:25:36] along. He goes on to, you know,
[2:25:39] discredit the miracle. What kind of
[2:25:42] preacher is this? And Granny jumps up
[2:25:45] and hollers again.
[2:25:47] Woo! She is having herself a spell. And
[2:25:52] he's soon going to find out, you can't
[2:25:53] do nothing with a granny like that.
[2:25:59] Jessica, Brandy, and Jason, you can't do
[2:26:03] nothing with a granny like that. You
[2:26:04] might as well just let her be.
[2:26:08] But he couldn't, you know, he was just I
[2:26:10] mean, he thought he was something had
[2:26:11] his little degree and everything. And he
[2:26:13] said, "Sister, did you not hear?" Oh, I
[2:26:15] heard you, preacher. I heard you. You
[2:26:18] said that the Red Sea was a Red Sea and
[2:26:22] it's only a few inches deep at that time
[2:26:24] of the year. and and and but I got so
[2:26:27] excited I couldn't hold myself. He said,
[2:26:30] "What was the reason for that?" She
[2:26:31] said, "I got to thinking about how big,
[2:26:34] how mighty my God is that he drowned
[2:26:39] Pharaoh and all of his army in three
[2:26:43] inches of water.
[2:26:46] That's my God." She said, "That's him.
[2:26:52] He can do Hallelujah. He can do
[2:26:55] exceedingly,
[2:26:58] can't he? If we can have faith to
[2:27:00] believe. Got to hurry. Got to hurry. I
[2:27:02] still got time, but I better
[2:27:10] hurry. There's some important things
[2:27:12] here. Moses went said, "Okay, Lord."
[2:27:16] They've
[2:27:17] agreed. They've
[2:27:20] agreed. Now, you look at Exodus 19 verse
[2:27:23] 20. And the Lord came down upon Mount
[2:27:25] Si. We read
[2:27:27] it called Moses up to the top of the
[2:27:30] mountain. And Moses went up. And the
[2:27:31] Lord said unto Moses, "Go down. Charge
[2:27:34] the people." And this is where the fence
[2:27:38] was put in
[2:27:40] place. Before I do what I'm going to
[2:27:44] do, before I show out the way I'm going
[2:27:47] to show out, I want to make sure that
[2:27:49] somebody doesn't get too close.
[2:27:55] Holiness and the standards of modesty
[2:27:58] and
[2:28:00] separation demand a
[2:28:03] distance between the common and the
[2:28:07] consecrated.
[2:28:11] remember the the charismatics who we've
[2:28:14] had some sweet times of fellowship with
[2:28:17] along the way would tell of these
[2:28:21] strange experiences
[2:28:24] of visiting the throne and hopping up in
[2:28:29] Papa's lap and giving an giving him a
[2:28:32] high
[2:28:33] five. It proves to me that the church
[2:28:37] has failed to teach people.
[2:28:42] There are some fences required. Now,
[2:28:47] they won't always be
[2:28:49] there. I promise you, if you so desire,
[2:28:52] you'll have an opportunity one day to
[2:28:54] kiss his feet.
[2:28:57] I promise you if you so desire one day
[2:28:59] you'll have an opportunity to bow before
[2:29:01] him and thank him for saving you.
[2:29:06] But there is a a protocol in place
[2:29:10] between that which is common and that
[2:29:12] which is sacred and holy. And God had to
[2:29:15] start putting that in place right here
[2:29:18] as he was about to come down and give
[2:29:21] this marriage covenant to his people.
[2:29:25] The boundary was a visual line, a
[2:29:28] spiritual line also that God is not to
[2:29:31] be approached
[2:29:33] lightly or on human
[2:29:36] terms. The fear of the Lord is not
[2:29:39] bondage. It's reverential fear. You you
[2:29:43] you don't have to be as a as a a
[2:29:46] covenant of grace, man or woman. You
[2:29:50] don't have to be afraid to call on him.
[2:29:54] You don't have to be afraid that he's
[2:29:56] going to uh smack you on the head with a
[2:29:59] sledgehammer if you fail. Because if
[2:30:01] that was the case, every one of us would
[2:30:04] be dead. I failed him many, many, many
[2:30:08] times. I've given him many reasons to
[2:30:11] disintegrate me.
[2:30:14] And yet his grace cried out.
[2:30:18] His blood pleaded my case.
[2:30:22] Hallelujah.
[2:30:23] and he gave me life instead of death.
[2:30:27] Amen. And I'm thankful for it. We're not
[2:30:29] talking about a fear that causes God's
[2:30:31] people to live. No, no. It's a
[2:30:32] reverential fear. It's a fear that makes
[2:30:34] us want to walk softly and live clean.
[2:30:37] It It should make us want to do right on
[2:30:40] our income tax. It ought to make us want
[2:30:42] to do right on our job. It It might want
[2:30:45] to make I think it'll make us walk away
[2:30:48] from a dirty joke.
[2:30:52] You know the need that some people have
[2:30:54] to give these little courtesy laughs. Uh
[2:30:58] you you're playing with fire when you do
[2:30:59] that. You ought to speak up for what's
[2:31:02] right. Let let me excuse myself. I don't
[2:31:05] I don't want to uh hinder your your your
[2:31:07] good laugh here, your good time or
[2:31:08] whatever you call it. But I don't have
[2:31:10] to hear it.
[2:31:13] My ears are not garbage cans and my
[2:31:15] spirit man is often fed by what comes in
[2:31:18] my eargate. And I just simply don't want
[2:31:20] to hear that. Isn't that being
[2:31:22] religious? No sir. It's having
[2:31:24] reverential fear of the God who's done
[2:31:26] so much on our behalf. Hello. These
[2:31:30] boundaries are not about legalism.
[2:31:33] They're about protection. This fence was
[2:31:36] not to keep people from experiencing the
[2:31:39] goodness of God. This fence was to keep
[2:31:42] people from uh uh uh stumbling in
[2:31:46] without making proper preparation.
[2:31:49] Today's fences, holiness, standard,
[2:31:52] modesty, consecration, sound doctrine,
[2:31:56] keeping our balance in the scripture.
[2:31:58] These are like landmarks
[2:32:01] that we are told you're cursed if you
[2:32:04] move them. This doesn't mean that we
[2:32:07] don't get an opportunity to understand
[2:32:10] as we go along that perhaps some of the
[2:32:13] things that we have uh enforced or
[2:32:16] embraced may not be
[2:32:18] necessary for
[2:32:22] all. There comes a time that we have to
[2:32:24] understand the difference between a
[2:32:26] standard and a conviction.
[2:32:29] If a standard has been set before us, we
[2:32:32] ought to walk in that standard. whether
[2:32:34] we personally feel attached to it or
[2:32:36] not.
[2:32:39] You see, uh, any man has a
[2:32:43] right to to say what goes on in his
[2:32:48] house.
[2:32:51] You understand that? You don't have to
[2:32:53] let your, you know, your neighborhood
[2:32:55] win come in and and and tear up your
[2:32:58] living room because you're a Christian.
[2:33:01] You want to love, it's all right to love
[2:33:03] him, but you don't have to let him come
[2:33:04] in and start throwing your your lamps
[2:33:06] out the door. You know, you've got a
[2:33:09] right to say and uh leadership of any uh
[2:33:12] community or family of faith, they
[2:33:14] certainly have a right to set a
[2:33:15] standard. And the people who desire to
[2:33:18] worship there have some measure of
[2:33:20] responsibility, right?
[2:33:23] To live that standard, whether it's been
[2:33:26] personally made real to them or not.
[2:33:29] But a conviction is something entirely
[2:33:31] different. When God gives you a
[2:33:34] conviction, you see, you might change
[2:33:36] houses. If you change communities, you
[2:33:39] might might one may have a different
[2:33:41] standard. You may just go right along
[2:33:43] and adjust to whatever that standard is.
[2:33:45] That's all right if it wasn't a
[2:33:47] conviction. But if God speaks to your
[2:33:49] heart with a conviction by the Holy
[2:33:51] Ghost and tells you stay away from that,
[2:33:56] I'm going to tell this. I tell it. I've
[2:33:58] hadn't told it in a while. I've told it
[2:34:00] many times. But brother Perry Green, a
[2:34:03] mentor and a friend of mine. There were
[2:34:05] two sisters that went to his church for
[2:34:07] many, many years. Uh, Sister uh, Miles,
[2:34:11] Sister Carolyn Miles, and her daughter,
[2:34:13] Sister Shandre Miles. And some of you
[2:34:15] all knew them. Now, they wore their uh,
[2:34:19] denim skirt. Of course, they wouldn't
[2:34:21] have worked in some places where they'd
[2:34:23] preach against
[2:34:25] denim, but they wore their long denim
[2:34:28] skirts and they wore long sleeve blouses
[2:34:31] that looked handmade and they rolled up
[2:34:34] their sleeves so that it wouldn't be
[2:34:36] short sleeve sleeveless or short sleeve
[2:34:39] wouldn't be long in the hot Tucson sun,
[2:34:42] but they rolled them up and the there
[2:34:44] was a big border around there where they
[2:34:46] rolled it up the underside of the very
[2:34:48] simple cotton calico looking print. I
[2:34:51] hope I've described it right. And those
[2:34:54] skirts went to the
[2:34:57] ground. I mean, just about to the
[2:34:59] ground. Maybe maybe like
[2:35:02] that. And they were the only ones. They
[2:35:06] went to church there the entire time
[2:35:07] that I had any fellowship with the
[2:35:09] tabernacle from 90 until they passed
[2:35:12] away after brother Green did in in 2015.
[2:35:17] They kept that standard and people
[2:35:20] didn't like it because I remember in the
[2:35:23] early 90s there was a young sister there
[2:35:25] who had a leather
[2:35:28] skirt. I I would think that most anybody
[2:35:31] raised around holiness is going to get
[2:35:33] real quiet in here. I don't care. You
[2:35:36] think I care. You're
[2:35:37] wrong. I'll call her name if I take a
[2:35:39] notion to. But uh she was a sweet girl,
[2:35:43] but she had some issues and they proved
[2:35:46] out later in her life. But there she was
[2:35:49] with a leather skirt on standing next to
[2:35:53] granny with a prairie skirt on. And the
[2:35:57] people would complain about who who do
[2:35:58] you think they complain
[2:36:01] about? The prairie skirt
[2:36:06] ladies. Oh, why? Well, I think they're
[2:36:09] looking down on the rest of us.
[2:36:11] Now these were not ordinary Trish. You
[2:36:14] know sister, these were not ordinary
[2:36:19] ladies. These were earthy
[2:36:21] women. They made their own
[2:36:25] yogurt. The last time I ever saw Sister
[2:36:27] Carolyn Miles, she asked us as a family
[2:36:31] to come over and pick her oranges for
[2:36:33] her. And we did. We went and spent
[2:36:36] several hours picking oranges out of her
[2:36:37] tree and fellowshipping with her. and
[2:36:40] enjoyed every minute of it. These were
[2:36:43] not ordinary ladies. They're special
[2:36:44] ladies. And I mean special in several
[2:36:47] different
[2:36:49] ways, including a bit
[2:36:52] eccentric. But I never knew them. Maybe
[2:36:54] you did. Maybe somebody else knew. They
[2:36:57] never I never felt in any way that they
[2:37:00] were looking down on anybody else. Now
[2:37:03] they kind of carried themselves
[2:37:04] differently. you can in a prairie
[2:37:08] skirt. When we went there and had these
[2:37:11] conferences with the charismatics and
[2:37:14] taught them what had taken place in
[2:37:16] Tucson
[2:37:18] supernaturally, Sister Carolyn and
[2:37:20] Sister Sandre had no problem going over
[2:37:22] there where only a few women that were
[2:37:24] associated with me would even have on a
[2:37:26] skirt. Out of 400 women, there'd only be
[2:37:30] a handful resting
[2:37:32] tight, extra tight.
[2:37:36] uh yoga britches or denim slacks
[2:37:41] tight. They never acted better or
[2:37:44] holier. I saw them right among them
[2:37:47] praying for them, loving them and so
[2:37:49] forth. But people who have little
[2:37:51] conviction
[2:37:53] always have problem with someone who has
[2:37:55] big conviction.
[2:37:58] Neither one of them have to be right or
[2:37:59] wrong. Brother Green got tired of that.
[2:38:03] Always. It's always their fault cuz they
[2:38:05] dress a certain way, not asking anybody
[2:38:07] else to do it. He got tired of that and
[2:38:09] he got to where he would say, "Now quit
[2:38:11] looking at
[2:38:15] them." He said, "That is how they feel
[2:38:19] the Lord would have them to
[2:38:22] dress." He said, "Sister Carolyn was a
[2:38:26] basketball star."
[2:38:29] I'm looking at this little granny trying
[2:38:32] to find a basketball star in
[2:38:34] her. She was a basketball star when she
[2:38:38] was a young girl and she had uh really
[2:38:41] nice
[2:38:46] legs and I mean I'm here listening to
[2:38:49] this on MP3 and I'm going,
[2:38:51] "What did he just say?" What I thought
[2:38:54] she said. He said, "Some might even say
[2:38:57] sexy legs and
[2:39:01] ankles." I'm thinking, "Brother Green,
[2:39:03] where are you going with this?"
[2:39:05] And so she feels like because there was
[2:39:08] so much attention placed on her legs as
[2:39:11] a young woman that now as a believer I
[2:39:14] mean I can't I mean we shouldn't even be
[2:39:16] talking about this but I can't imagine
[2:39:18] that after all these anyway moving along
[2:39:22] legs change bodies change but this was
[2:39:25] in her heart and he said leave them
[2:39:28] alone you don't have to live like that
[2:39:31] but don't judge them and I don't want
[2:39:34] them judging Can you do you understand
[2:39:35] that's a conviction?
[2:39:38] Standard was modesty. Standard was a
[2:39:41] skirt or a dress. Standard was make sure
[2:39:44] we're separate. But conviction for them
[2:39:47] was something entirely different. If God
[2:39:49] lays a conviction on your heart, don't
[2:39:52] you give it up.
[2:39:55] But don't you judge somebody else by
[2:39:57] that.
[2:40:00] Now in this message we find both
[2:40:03] standard and conviction.
[2:40:08] You're obligated to the scripture
[2:40:11] that sets the standard. But you don't
[2:40:14] necessarily have to buy into somebody's
[2:40:17] conviction.
[2:40:18] That's something personal. And that's
[2:40:21] something that we may find one family
[2:40:23] doing it one way, one family doing it
[2:40:25] another way. May God bless them all.
[2:40:27] Right. There are certain
[2:40:31] boundaries that must not be fooled with.
[2:40:34] There are certain fences that must not
[2:40:37] be trespass.
[2:40:39] Now, how many of you saw what happened
[2:40:41] during worship? She wasn't the first who
[2:40:45] said that. She was the first who did
[2:40:49] that.
[2:40:50] I had several say to me, I didn't want
[2:40:52] to disturb you, but I thought about
[2:40:54] getting right up in the middle of your
[2:40:55] message and moving that back across
[2:40:58] because last Sunday without anybody
[2:41:00] knowing what was going on, we had
[2:41:02] Jonathan come. That hat rack was sitting
[2:41:04] there uh an old hat rack and and as I
[2:41:08] was preaching on not removing the
[2:41:10] ancient landmark, Jonathan would get up
[2:41:12] and move that thing just a few inches.
[2:41:15] Is that right? You saw it, didn't you?
[2:41:17] The next thing you know, after two hours
[2:41:20] of preaching, it finally landed on the
[2:41:22] other side. And I had somebody come up
[2:41:24] to me Sunday and say, "I almost jumped
[2:41:27] up and took it back where it belongs."
[2:41:29] And I said, "Well, you could
[2:41:31] have." Some wouldn't have done that cuz
[2:41:33] they were still trying to figure out
[2:41:34] what was happening to the cat to the hat
[2:41:37] rack. But some said, "I couldn't stand
[2:41:40] the fact that that was representing the
[2:41:43] old ancient landmarks and and we were
[2:41:46] leaving it over here."
[2:41:48] And then Tuesday night, I had it set
[2:41:50] back. It was back in my office. I had it
[2:41:52] set back over. What side do you want it
[2:41:54] on? I want it where we left
[2:41:56] it. And after the service, the sister
[2:41:58] come up and said, "I almost got up right
[2:42:01] in the middle of the service, but I
[2:42:02] didn't know what you think when you're
[2:42:04] still preaching on this. I almost got up
[2:42:06] and ran across a church and put it back
[2:42:08] where it belongs. That's right. And
[2:42:10] we're worshiping the Lord this morning
[2:42:12] and singing about chains breaking and
[2:42:15] chains falling. And under the same
[2:42:18] inspiration, Sister Ashley grabs that
[2:42:20] thing and makes her way back over here
[2:42:24] to set it where it belongs. Let me tell
[2:42:26] you something. I was just waiting on
[2:42:28] that. I didn't need another person to
[2:42:31] tell me what they almost did. I
[2:42:34] understand it was in respect. They
[2:42:36] didn't want to interrupt. I get that.
[2:42:38] But I didn't need another halfozen
[2:42:40] people to come up and say, "I almost
[2:42:42] moved it. I needed somebody
[2:42:47] who would say let's put that back
[2:42:50] where it represents the fences. It they
[2:42:54] may look a little different in your but
[2:42:55] that represents the fences. That
[2:42:58] represents the boundaries. That
[2:43:01] represents the old paths. Ask ye for the
[2:43:06] old paths. I'll show you where they are,
[2:43:10] and I'll bless you when you walk in
[2:43:12] them.
[2:43:14] If this compromise uh continues in the
[2:43:17] church world, there will be a total
[2:43:21] replacement of biblical truth with new
[2:43:24] age ideas.
[2:43:28] Somebody has to go back.
[2:43:31] Somebody has to say now you heard that
[2:43:35] verse and sometimes the words are
[2:43:39] changed to
[2:43:40] child and then I'll rise then we'll rise
[2:43:44] like a sleeping child but the original
[2:43:48] words were giant
[2:43:51] and some people don't understand that so
[2:43:54] they changed the words but the original
[2:43:58] family who sung
[2:44:04] that I had the
[2:44:07] privilege of driving them around
[2:44:10] Columbus and almost getting them
[2:44:14] killed. But but God, he helped us.
[2:44:18] Perry
[2:44:19] sisters were here for a concert and they
[2:44:24] they reached out through a publishing
[2:44:26] company and contacted me at the
[2:44:30] bookstore and said, "We'd like to come
[2:44:31] and and meet you and have some time at
[2:44:34] the at the bookstore." I had a little
[2:44:35] small Christian bookstore at the
[2:44:38] time. And I asked them about
[2:44:41] this and they we don't know. All we know
[2:44:44] is when we got it, it said sleeping
[2:44:46] giant. So we were singing it like
[2:44:49] sleeping giant. I said, 'Well, now let
[2:44:50] me tell you about it. You know about it?
[2:44:53] I do know about it. It was a
[2:44:56] vision. I think that it was Tommy Hicks.
[2:45:00] I might be wrong. Is that right?
[2:45:03] I think it was Tommy Hicks, one of the
[2:45:06] healing evangelists of the voice of
[2:45:09] healing who had this vision of the
[2:45:12] church like the book Guliver's Travels.
[2:45:17] Is that right,
[2:45:18] too? Where they had taken the giant and
[2:45:23] tied him down. These little
[2:45:26] people and do you know what they're
[2:45:29] called? Elephants.
[2:45:32] leiputs. I don't remember all those
[2:45:37] details. I might call them munchkins or
[2:45:40] something. But
[2:45:42] anyway, they this giant was tied down
[2:45:47] and Tommy Hicks has this vision and he
[2:45:49] sees something similar. He sees the
[2:45:51] church tied down like
[2:45:53] that and he sees that there's going to
[2:45:56] be a change
[2:45:58] necessary to cut that giant representing
[2:46:01] the church loose. And it goes on, it's a
[2:46:04] beautiful vision. I don't have it. I'll
[2:46:05] read it for you sometime. But the
[2:46:07] songwriter caught inspiration from that
[2:46:10] and said, "Then we'll rise like a
[2:46:13] sleeping giant standing tall in God's
[2:46:17] strength and might." The power that we
[2:46:21] claim so long, we'll see it returning.
[2:46:24] We're being made strong. Why? Because we
[2:46:27] go back to the absolute.
[2:46:32] I can show you in the absolute where
[2:46:35] separation is right, where modesty is
[2:46:38] right, where holiness is right, where
[2:46:41] differentiation between the genders,
[2:46:44] only two by the way, is right.
[2:46:48] I don't understand a doctrine of
[2:46:51] inclusion that it that requires me to
[2:46:55] compromise what the scripture says to
[2:46:58] include. The covenant is this. If you'll
[2:47:02] obey my covenant, my word, if you'll
[2:47:05] obey my commandments, he said, I will
[2:47:08] take you out and keep you out from all
[2:47:11] the other nations, and you will be a
[2:47:13] peculiar treasure unto me. And I'll
[2:47:16] bless you. I'll bless you in your
[2:47:18] coming. I'll bless you in your going.
[2:47:20] I'll bless you in your uprising and in
[2:47:22] your down setting. Come on. I'll bless
[2:47:24] you in the country and I'll bless you in
[2:47:26] the city. I'll bless you when you have
[2:47:28] hope. I'll bless you when you have no
[2:47:31] hope if you'll keep my covenant. And
[2:47:34] Israel screams before you ever told us
[2:47:37] what was required. We will do it. We
[2:47:40] will do it. We will do it. You believe
[2:47:41] they meant it? They meant it. But it
[2:47:44] didn't take them long to change their
[2:47:45] mind.
[2:47:46] That's right.
[2:47:49] It didn't take them long. I'm nearly
[2:47:50] done. I'm stopping. I'm not done. Nearly
[2:47:55] stopping. Didn't take them long to
[2:47:59] forget because they needed now a God
[2:48:04] that they could
[2:48:06] see. We need an
[2:48:08] image. We saw a fire. We heard a voice.
[2:48:12] We smelt the smoke. But now we need a
[2:48:15] God with a
[2:48:16] body. And so Aaron leads this uh new
[2:48:23] denomination and they remember the god
[2:48:26] of Egypt. One was a calf and they make
[2:48:29] them a horned
[2:48:30] calf like unto uh this
[2:48:35] uh god that they saw in Egypt. Moses the
[2:48:38] prophet is on the mountain getting the
[2:48:40] word.
[2:48:42] They're tired of waiting. Tired of
[2:48:43] waiting. Tired of waiting. Tired of
[2:48:44] waiting. Anybody weary? Anybody get a
[2:48:47] little tired of waiting
[2:48:49] sometime? Well, I spent about six days
[2:48:52] since I saw you. Well, since last
[2:48:55] Sunday, uh trying to to pour myself
[2:48:59] again into the seventh
[2:49:01] seal and and I could say I'm a little
[2:49:05] weary waiting for the fullness of
[2:49:08] understanding because when God began to
[2:49:11] unfold that thing, it came in three a
[2:49:13] three-fold manner, only two of which
[2:49:16] have been given understanding on. And I
[2:49:18] and I'm just praying. I'm not trying to
[2:49:20] be somebody just a believer. I just want
[2:49:23] to see what the word means. And I spend
[2:49:26] some time and I get a little weary
[2:49:27] thinking about it. I get a little weary
[2:49:29] when I think of how long I've waited to
[2:49:31] understand some of those things. But I
[2:49:34] want you to know I I cannot I must not I
[2:49:38] refuse to to find another way
[2:49:43] because I'm tired of waiting on the
[2:49:45] fullness of understanding. They were
[2:49:47] tired of waiting on the prophet to come
[2:49:48] down. And so they just made them a a
[2:49:51] calf. And if you look at the Hebrew, you
[2:49:54] you don't even want to know how they
[2:49:55] behaved. They were having these horrible
[2:49:58] sexual parties, doing all kinds of crazy
[2:50:00] things before that golden calf. I'm
[2:50:02] telling you, it cost them something. Do
[2:50:04] you know what it cost them? 3,000 men.
[2:50:07] And
[2:50:08] 3,000 3,000 lost their lives.
[2:50:12] It cost him something just after
[2:50:15] shaveote. So before you say I'll do it
[2:50:18] before you say it, before you jump in
[2:50:21] and say God I'll follow you the rest of
[2:50:23] my no matter what you require, you
[2:50:24] better know you mean it cuz he may call
[2:50:27] it in. Now I don't I'm skipping skipping
[2:50:30] skipping skipping skipping skipping
[2:50:31] skipping.
[2:50:34] But I've got to get to the last
[2:50:35] installment of Shàuote because six God
[2:50:39] gives the law.
[2:50:41] Jesus comes, fulfills this thing that
[2:50:44] Abraham saw, this great
[2:50:47] sacrifice, blood shed, and he's
[2:50:50] resurrected, and great things have
[2:50:52] happened. And he says, "I've got to
[2:50:55] leave
[2:50:56] you. Try in the city of Jerusalem until
[2:50:59] you be endued with power." Acts 18.
[2:51:01] Until you be endued with power from on
[2:51:03] high. Guess what day God
[2:51:05] chose? Sivon
[2:51:08] 6.
[2:51:10] shaveote. And what did he do? Well, you
[2:51:13] know the story, and I don't have all the
[2:51:16] time I need. Sorry. I thought I could be
[2:51:18] done. I I thought I could get this out.
[2:51:20] I I told my wife, I'm I'm more pleased
[2:51:22] now than I was when I when I went to bed
[2:51:24] last night because I think I've put it
[2:51:26] together in a way I can get it out. And
[2:51:28] I haven't done it, but I sure
[2:51:30] tried. You got to give me a little
[2:51:32] something. I tried. And when the day of
[2:51:35] Pentecost, Acts 2:1, and when the day of
[2:51:37] Pentecost was fully come, Sivon 6,
[2:51:42] Shàuote, the 50th day, seven, seven
[2:51:46] Sabbaths after the resurrection, and on
[2:51:49] the day after, which we know would have
[2:51:51] been the first day of the week, which we
[2:51:52] know would have been on a Sunday. And
[2:51:54] when the day of Pentecost
[2:51:58] was, they were all
[2:52:00] with in one place. And suddenly there
[2:52:04] came a sound from heaven as of
[2:52:06] a and it filled all the house where they
[2:52:10] were sitting. No upper room mentioned
[2:52:13] here by the way. And there appeared unto
[2:52:17] them fire.
[2:52:21] How did it come down
[2:52:25] 6i? Fire. How did it come down? Day of
[2:52:30] Pentecost, right after the resurrection,
[2:52:33] 40
[2:52:34] days Jesus has been ministering,
[2:52:38] operating. Then there's days that were
[2:52:41] set aside for consecration and for full
[2:52:45] committment. And Israel was keeping this
[2:52:48] consecration every year, preparing
[2:52:50] themselves for this installment. And
[2:52:52] then Jesus leaves them on the 40. on the
[2:52:55] 40 he's
[2:52:57] gone and they're left to figure out what
[2:52:59] to do. He said, "I will not leave you
[2:53:02] comfortless. I will come to you. I'm
[2:53:05] going to pray the father. He's going to
[2:53:06] send a another comforter to you. This is
[2:53:08] going to happen." Terry in Jerusalem
[2:53:10] until you be endued with power. Now the
[2:53:12] day has come. Sivon 6. Suddenly there
[2:53:14] came a sound from heaven as a rushing
[2:53:16] mighty wind filled all the house where
[2:53:17] they were sitting. Appeared cloven
[2:53:19] tongues of what? Sat on each of them and
[2:53:22] they were all filled.
[2:53:26] Don't you come around here and tell me I
[2:53:29] I I want the Holy
[2:53:32] Spirit. He answers by that. But I
[2:53:36] growing up, we let the Baptist and the
[2:53:38] Methodist say Holy Spirit. The
[2:53:40] Pentecostal said Holy Ghost and
[2:53:46] fire. John said there's one coming after
[2:53:49] me. He's going to baptize
[2:53:52] you.
[2:53:55] Here it is. They began speaking with
[2:53:59] other tongues
[2:54:01] as the spirit gave them utterance. Not
[2:54:04] somebody taught them how to say it or
[2:54:05] what to say or how to do, but the spirit
[2:54:08] of God began to speak out of their
[2:54:09] lives. And I got so much I'd like to
[2:54:11] tell you about that. Uh but but my time
[2:54:14] is
[2:54:17] gone. There's a message I'd like to
[2:54:19] quote from as we close. Musicians start
[2:54:21] coming. I'll try to I think I'd like to
[2:54:23] hit a few of these things Tuesday night.
[2:54:25] I don't want to leave them. I leave too
[2:54:27] many of my notes un
[2:54:31] undelivered. Paragraph 45. Jesus when he
[2:54:34] was on earth anointed with that that
[2:54:36] they saw notice he said I come from God
[2:54:40] the spirit the light the pillar of fire
[2:54:43] and I return to God. And he was made
[2:54:45] flesh in order to die for our sins. Do
[2:54:49] you believe that?
[2:54:51] I do too. Then after his death, burial,
[2:54:55] resurrection, and ascension, after he
[2:54:58] ascended up on the 40 days, he ascended
[2:55:01] up and on the 50th day he returned back.
[2:55:07] Same life, same God, same spirit that
[2:55:11] was in him. You believe that? He
[2:55:13] returned back in a form of a pillar of
[2:55:16] fire again among the people and
[2:55:18] separated himself like tongues of fire
[2:55:21] this time. Not one great big pillar of
[2:55:24] fire, but now it appeared as as cloven
[2:55:27] tongues of fire setting on each of their
[2:55:31] heads. One great big pillar of fire
[2:55:34] dividing itself. And now every person in
[2:55:37] that upper room, 120 gathered there, all
[2:55:40] have this manifestation of God's Holy
[2:55:43] Ghost fire. And they began to speak in
[2:55:45] other tongues as the spirit of God gave
[2:55:47] them utterance. Now you see, we are not
[2:55:51] a divided
[2:55:53] people. Paragraph
[2:55:55] 47. We've got to be in unity because
[2:55:59] each one of us holding a part of God.
[2:56:04] You understand that? That's not some new
[2:56:06] age craziness. That's the reality of
[2:56:09] Acts chapter 2. And we must come
[2:56:12] together and then the pillar of fire is
[2:56:14] manifested in the wholeness in the
[2:56:16] fullness of it. When his church set
[2:56:17] together in heavenly places, then the
[2:56:20] fullness of the power of God is in his
[2:56:22] church. I want somebody to squeeze an
[2:56:25] amen. Each one of
[2:56:27] us, each one of
[2:56:32] us, each one of us holding spiritual
[2:56:35] gifts and spiritual offices coming
[2:56:39] together brings that pillar of
[2:56:43] fire huh
[2:56:46] back again.
[2:56:48] It's so important for us to come create
[2:56:50] the right atmosphere, bring our
[2:56:52] individual licks of fire into the place,
[2:56:55] begin to worship the Lord with total
[2:56:57] abandonment, and his spirit rides in and
[2:57:00] somebody catches an inspiration. Because
[2:57:03] before the fire fell, Moses had to make
[2:57:06] sure that there were boundaries set
[2:57:08] around the mountain and then the fire
[2:57:10] could fall. You understand?
[2:57:13] and and before the fire can fall here,
[2:57:15] we've got to go back and reconsecrate an
[2:57:17] altar before the Lord. And that's not a
[2:57:19] piece of
[2:57:21] furniture. This that is a that is a
[2:57:24] mourner's bench. And it's a Methodist
[2:57:27] tradition. You see, there is no altar in
[2:57:30] the scripture where people come and
[2:57:32] repent.
[2:57:35] They come to die. They come to worship
[2:57:38] God.
[2:57:39] And and anything I know about an altar
[2:57:41] in the Bible is it's a place of death.
[2:57:43] So you don't have to have that piece.
[2:57:45] But thank God you've got it and thank
[2:57:47] God we can use it and we should. But but
[2:57:50] your altar is not a piece of furniture.
[2:57:52] Your altar is is an attitude of your
[2:57:54] heart. You're humbling yourself before
[2:57:57] God. And God can meet you on the
[2:57:59] tractor.
[2:58:02] He can meet you in the corn crib.
[2:58:05] He can meet you uh in Walmart.
[2:58:10] Wherever you are, he'll meet you here,
[2:58:12] but he can meet you in the yard. He can
[2:58:14] meet you at your kitchen sink.
[2:58:16] Hallelujah. He can meet you, Mimi, and
[2:58:19] your dog
[2:58:21] kennel. He can meet you wherever,
[2:58:24] wherever you decide. I'm going to go
[2:58:26] back and reconsecrate my altar. I'm
[2:58:29] going to bow my heart this time, not
[2:58:31] just my knee. I'm going to bow my heart
[2:58:33] and I'm going to pray that God will send
[2:58:36] a fire that will break off every chain
[2:58:39] and every yoke and every bondage and
[2:58:42] every habit and every thought that is
[2:58:44] unlike him. How many of you believe that
[2:58:47] there is a key when we are willing to go
[2:58:50] back and start a fresh with the Lord? He
[2:58:52] allows that. He allows that. He allows
[2:58:56] U-turns. He allows us to come again and
[2:59:00] say, "Lord, I want to start a fresh. I
[2:59:03] want to start a new. I wanna I want to
[2:59:06] have my own shave. I want to have my own
[2:59:09] installment." You see, the greatest
[2:59:11] thing that God did in in differentiating
[2:59:15] between the two installments of of
[2:59:17] Shàuote is in the first Shaveote, 3,000
[2:59:20] rebelled and 3,000 died.
[2:59:23] But in on the day of Pentecost, the
[2:59:25] Bible says that when the spirit of God
[2:59:27] fell and they begin to they begin to
[2:59:30] that 3,000 souls
[2:59:34] came to the kingdom of God. You think
[2:59:36] that's a you think that's a coincidence?
[2:59:38] I don't. I think God was saying, here's
[2:59:41] where the difference has come. It's the
[2:59:43] law is no longer
[2:59:46] written on a tablet of stone and the
[2:59:49] instruction is no longer written on a
[2:59:51] sheep's skin.
[2:59:53] It's now where is it written? The
[2:59:56] scripture says on the fleshy tables of
[2:59:58] the heart. That's what this further
[3:00:01] latter installment of shave has done.
[3:00:03] He's now taken his law, his instruction,
[3:00:06] his truth, and he has written it on our
[3:00:08] heart. So that the the word I'll read it
[3:00:11] to you Tuesday night. The word is so
[3:00:13] powerful because it says this is such
[3:00:15] that men will not have to keep coming
[3:00:17] and saying, "What did he say? What does
[3:00:19] he say? What does he say? What's the
[3:00:20] way?" But instead, you'll be able to
[3:00:22] tell them. You'll be able to know and
[3:00:24] you'll be able to tell them immediately
[3:00:25] because it's written here.
[3:00:29] All I know is that I know that I know
[3:00:30] that I know that I know. How do you
[3:00:33] know? I know because it's been made real
[3:00:35] to me. Let's
[3:00:39] stand. Don't you dare break through the
[3:00:43] fences.
[3:00:45] Don't you dare
[3:00:47] forget that God's word is holy and
[3:00:49] sacred and true. Don't you dare forget
[3:00:52] that God loves you so much. He has now
[3:00:54] put it right inside of you.
[3:00:57] This same spirit that raised Jesus from
[3:01:00] the dead, he said, "If that dwells in
[3:01:03] you, it shall it shall what? It shall
[3:01:07] also quicken," which means resurrect and
[3:01:10] make alive. It shall also quicken your
[3:01:13] mortal body. Without the quickening
[3:01:16] power of Jesus Christ, without the
[3:01:19] fullness of the resurrection and what
[3:01:21] happened in the ascension, the spirit of
[3:01:23] God being poured out again on us.
[3:01:25] Without that, we have no hope beyond the
[3:01:28] grave. How many of you are glad Paul
[3:01:30] said it that way? If Christ be not
[3:01:32] risen, the death was enough. But the
[3:01:36] reality is we we've got to get past
[3:01:38] death.
[3:01:40] We got to get past death. And so if he
[3:01:42] had not
[3:01:43] risen, we could have died in hope, but
[3:01:46] we had no hope of ever getting up again.
[3:01:49] But Jesus has now become the first
[3:01:51] fruits of them which slept,
[3:01:54] giving the promise of eternal life.
[3:01:57] uh Jessica and Sister Cindy and others.
[3:02:00] If it weren't for
[3:02:02] that, if it wasn't for that hope, we
[3:02:05] couldn't do what we have to do.
[3:02:09] Sometimes, we couldn't do it. We
[3:02:11] couldn't get past
[3:02:16] it. When we lose those we love, we
[3:02:21] couldn't get past it.
[3:02:24] But because of this, because he didn't
[3:02:28] just die, he rose again.
[3:02:31] He gives us hope.
[3:02:36] Hallelujah.
[3:02:38] Thessalonians, first Thessalonians,
[3:02:40] isn't
[3:02:43] it?
[3:02:47] Those who are alive and
[3:02:51] remain will be caught up together to
[3:02:53] meet the Lord in the air and to meet the
[3:02:56] righteous dead. And so shall we forever
[3:02:59] be with the
[3:03:02] Lord. Well, where are they now? What are
[3:03:04] they doing now? I don't know. I don't I
[3:03:07] don't fully understand and know exactly
[3:03:09] what all are going on
[3:03:11] now. I don't think it's what some folks
[3:03:14] think. I don't think our loved ones are
[3:03:16] wearing diapers and playing
[3:03:18] harps. I don't think they've all of a
[3:03:20] sudden become
[3:03:22] angels. They were more angels here to us
[3:03:24] because we loved them and cherished
[3:03:26] them. But I believe they're waiting on
[3:03:29] us in the presence of God. To be absent
[3:03:33] from the body is to be present with the
[3:03:36] Lord. That's enough. We may not figure
[3:03:38] out the details till we get over there,
[3:03:39] but that's enough. If I can have hope
[3:03:41] that my loved one that I've had to say
[3:03:43] goodbye to is now in the presence of the
[3:03:45] Lord. If I can have that hope, I can get
[3:03:47] through this
[3:03:49] thing. The dead in Christ shall
[3:03:52] what? Rise
[3:03:54] first. And then we which are alive and
[3:03:57] remain, we catch
[3:03:58] them in the air with the Lord. You
[3:04:02] really believe all that? With all my
[3:04:04] heart. With all my heart. I believe. May
[3:04:08] we make sure that we're ready to go. May
[3:04:11] we quit fooling around with the
[3:04:13] standards that God has set before us.
[3:04:16] May we be faithful to our
[3:04:19] convictions. May we not move the the the
[3:04:21] boundaries an inch at a time. May we
[3:04:24] just leave them where they are. They're
[3:04:26] things we don't understand. We just give
[3:04:28] them. I just keep giving them to the
[3:04:30] Lord. Lord, you talk to us. You help us.
[3:04:33] Aren't you glad we're growing? Aren't
[3:04:34] you glad we're still climbing mountains?
[3:04:37] Now, the presence of the Lord is here
[3:04:39] now. And anything you have need of, you
[3:04:42] can have if you have the faith to
[3:04:45] believe. And you know what? I believe
[3:04:47] you do. I believe you do. I believe
[3:04:50] there's enough faith in the room right
[3:04:52] now to manifest healing for your
[3:04:55] body. I believe there's enough faith in
[3:04:57] the room right now to to bring
[3:05:00] deliverance to your bondage.
[3:05:04] I believe there's enough faith in the
[3:05:06] room right now to bring you right into
[3:05:08] the presence of the Lord. Father, here
[3:05:11] we
[3:05:12] are. It's been a little tough getting
[3:05:14] through
[3:05:16] this. Sure took long
[3:05:19] time, but I want to know that I have
[3:05:23] obeyed
[3:05:29] you. We don't do this for a paycheck.
[3:05:33] We do it to be able to to meet you one
[3:05:36] day and have
[3:05:41] peace. There are needs in this house.
[3:05:43] And I don't think that it has to
[3:05:46] be beating the floor to get you to come
[3:05:50] down to meet the need. I believe your
[3:05:54] word has brought you down.
[3:05:56] I believe that even though we had to
[3:05:58] make our way through some dry spots in
[3:06:00] this, I believe we've we've been sitting
[3:06:02] together in heavenly
[3:06:05] places because that's what the unfolding
[3:06:07] of your word does. The tying together of
[3:06:10] scripture with scripture that brings us
[3:06:12] into an atmosphere of faith. So, I have
[3:06:14] to believe you're here. And I have to
[3:06:16] believe that you've got healing for
[3:06:17] every
[3:06:19] pain, whether it be
[3:06:21] internal
[3:06:23] heartaches or whether it be physical
[3:06:27] pain. With your
[3:06:30] stripes, we're
[3:06:35] healed. May
[3:06:38] truth break through the darkness of
[3:06:40] every religious lie. And may we come to
[3:06:43] the re
[3:06:45] revelation so that we can have the
[3:06:47] personal
[3:06:49] revival. We honor the
[3:06:52] fences and the fire will
[3:06:55] fall. Lord, come and burn out the chaff
[3:06:58] and consecrate our hearts, our
[3:07:03] attitudes, our bad
[3:07:06] thinking. Bring us into the presence of
[3:07:08] the Lord.
[3:07:11] and we'll praise you. Thank you for
[3:07:13] another
[3:07:14] opportunity to worship you
[3:07:20] [Music]
[3:07:26] now. How do you
[3:07:33] explain? How do you describe
[3:07:41] A love that goes from east to
[3:07:46] west and runs as deep as it is
[3:07:54] wide. Lord, you know all our
[3:08:01] hopes and you know all our fears.
[3:08:06] [Music]
[3:08:09] And words cannot express the love we
[3:08:14] feel. But we long for you to
[3:08:22] hear. Just listen to our
[3:08:28] [Music]
[3:08:29] hearts. Hear our spirit
[3:08:35] sing. A song of praise that
[3:08:42] flows for those you have
[3:08:49] redeemed. And we will use the words we
[3:08:54] know to tell you what an awesome God you
[3:09:02] are. But when words are not
[3:09:06] enough to tell you of our love, Lord,
[3:09:11] listen to our
[3:09:13] [Music]
[3:09:16] hearts. If words could fall, I
[3:09:20] [Music]
[3:09:23] gra from these lips of
[3:09:28] [Music]
[3:09:29] mine. And if I had a thousand
[3:09:35] years, Lord, I would still run out of
[3:09:39] time.
[3:09:41] [Music]
[3:09:43] So if you listen to my
[3:09:49] heart, Lord, every beat will
[3:09:56] say, Lord, thank you for the
[3:10:00] life. Thank you for the truth and thank
[3:10:04] you for the way.
[3:10:10] So listen to our
[3:10:16] hearts. Hear our spirit
[3:10:22] sing. A song of praise that
[3:10:29] flows for those you have
[3:10:35] redeemed. Lord, we will use the words we
[3:10:40] know just to tell you what an awesome
[3:10:46] God that you are. But when words are not
[3:10:52] enough to tell you of our love, Lord,
[3:10:57] listen to our hearts.
[3:11:01] [Music]
[3:11:03] So listen to our
[3:11:08] [Music]
[3:11:09] hearts, Lord. Hear our spirit
[3:11:16] sing. The song of praise that
[3:11:22] flows for those you have redeemed.
[3:11:30] And we will use the words we know just
[3:11:34] to tell you what an
[3:11:39] awesome God that you are. But when words
[3:11:44] are not enough to tell you of our love.
[3:11:50] Oh, listen to our heart. Just let your
[3:11:53] heart talk to him right now. And we will
[3:11:56] when our words are not enough just let
[3:11:58] your heart talk to him. Here we are
[3:12:01] Lord. Here we are. We are asking you for
[3:12:05] another installment of the fire that
[3:12:08] fell at
[3:12:09] Shàuote. Send the Holy Ghost fire into
[3:12:13] our lives. not only to cleanse but to
[3:12:17] empower, to equip us to live a godly
[3:12:21] life, to set an example for those around
[3:12:24] us. We cannot do it with our own works.
[3:12:28] But as we surrender to you, Lord, we can
[3:12:31] let your life live in us. The life that
[3:12:34] we now live, not ours, but it's your
[3:12:37] life now living in us. We consecrate
[3:12:41] ourselves even in this moment right now.
[3:12:44] Would you just spread your heart before
[3:12:46] the Lord? Would you just say, "Here I
[3:12:48] am, Lord. I want to fall in love with
[3:12:51] you even more than I've ever loved you
[3:12:53] before. I want to give more of myself to
[3:12:57] to your kingdom work, to your purposes
[3:13:00] in my life. And when I don't even have
[3:13:03] the words to tell you where I am, what
[3:13:06] I'm going through, Lord, let my heart
[3:13:08] cry out. I'm thankful that you hear us
[3:13:11] when we don't have words. I'm thankful
[3:13:14] that you hear us, Lord, when we don't
[3:13:16] even know how to pray. I'm thankful that
[3:13:19] the Holy Ghost has made a way. Your
[3:13:21] spirit can even pray through us with
[3:13:24] groanings that cannot be uttered. We
[3:13:27] just
[3:13:28] surrender. I can't shake the feeling
[3:13:31] that God's particularly calling to
[3:13:34] somebody. I hope he's calling all of us,
[3:13:37] but I can't shake the feeling that he's
[3:13:40] particularly calling to somebody. Would
[3:13:43] you just surrender a little more of who
[3:13:45] you
[3:13:46] are? If you feel like there's a little
[3:13:48] part of you that perhaps you've not yet
[3:13:50] laid down before him, would you do that
[3:13:53] right now? Maybe a particular area of
[3:13:56] your life that you've not let him get in
[3:13:58] and move and change some stuff and
[3:14:02] rearrange some stuff. you've kind of
[3:14:04] held it a little more personal and not
[3:14:07] allowed the Holy Ghost to have his way
[3:14:09] in that area of your life. Would you
[3:14:11] just be
[3:14:12] willing? Would you just be willing right
[3:14:15] now to come and say, "Lord, I'm I'm
[3:14:17] willing for you to change my mind, my
[3:14:19] heart, my direction, my plans. Whatever
[3:14:24] it is that I've been holding back as
[3:14:26] though it were mine to possess, I now
[3:14:29] lay it before you." Sing the chorus
[3:14:32] again. We'll just sing it as a prayer.
[3:14:34] Listen to my heart.
[3:14:37] Hear my spirit. Sing out your word. Hear
[3:14:40] our spirit.
[3:14:42] Faithfulness, your goodness, your mercy.
[3:14:46] A song of praise that flow. Let it come
[3:14:49] out of me to glorify your holy name to
[3:14:52] those you have redeemed.
[3:14:56] I want the world to know that you live
[3:14:58] in me. And we will use a word we know
[3:15:04] to tell you what an awesome God you are
[3:15:11] but when words words are not enough here
[3:15:14] I am Lord to tell you of our love Lord
[3:15:19] listen to our heart one more time the
[3:15:22] chorus just like that listen so listen
[3:15:26] to our
[3:15:31] hearts and hear our spirit sing.
[3:15:37] Jesus, a song of praise that
[3:15:44] flows for those you have redeemed.
[3:15:48] [Music]
[3:15:52] And we will use the words we know to
[3:15:57] tell you what an awesome God that you
[3:16:04] are. But when words are not enough
[3:16:09] to tell you of our
[3:16:11] love. Oh, listen to our heart.
[3:16:17] Bless you. If you need to leave, you're
[3:16:19] free to go. You're dismissed to go. If
[3:16:22] you need to go, I don't I've held you so
[3:16:24] long. I I don't want to force you out of
[3:16:27] respect to stay any longer. If you need
[3:16:30] to go, you can. I wonder, are there some
[3:16:33] who just have some special need before
[3:16:35] the Lord? You just hold up your hand. I
[3:16:37] have a special need. Keep it up just a
[3:16:39] minute. Now, let's let's practice a
[3:16:42] little body ministry here real quickly.
[3:16:44] Keep your hand up just a minute.
[3:16:47] These say we have a special need here
[3:16:49] under this
[3:16:51] hand. Under this hand, there's a need. I
[3:16:54] want the rest of you if you if you feel
[3:16:58] comfortable to do it. Would you just
[3:17:00] someone get near that person? Keep your
[3:17:02] hand up for just another moment. Even
[3:17:04] those out there, if they've got their
[3:17:05] hand up, just
[3:17:07] somebody just slip to them. You're not
[3:17:11] going to prophesy over them. You're
[3:17:12] going to just join your faith with
[3:17:14] theirs right now. So that no one said I
[3:17:16] have a special need and and doesn't have
[3:17:18] yet someone to join faith. I tell you
[3:17:20] there's power in agreement. When we join
[3:17:23] our faith together anything God can do
[3:17:25] anything but fail he can't fail. Now did
[3:17:30] everybody that has their hand up I I've
[3:17:33] my glasses keep fogging so I took them
[3:17:35] off. Uh if you are here and you've got a
[3:17:38] need and you raised your hand please
[3:17:40] let's make sure that every one of those
[3:17:41] people have somebody. I think maybe they
[3:17:43] do. Now let's agree with them. Father,
[3:17:46] in the name of
[3:17:47] Jesus, you said in your word that if two
[3:17:51] would agree as touching on any one thing
[3:17:54] in your name that you would you would
[3:17:56] give it. You would release it. Now, I
[3:18:00] don't believe that necessarily means we
[3:18:02] have to know the details of that need. I
[3:18:05] I believe it's all right not to know.
[3:18:09] We join our faith right now with with
[3:18:12] others in this house. And we pray for
[3:18:15] those who had a uplifted hand that
[3:18:17] represented a need in the heart. And and
[3:18:20] we believe, Lord, that you're faithful
[3:18:22] to that need. Hallelujah.
[3:18:25] We believe you saw this moment before it
[3:18:27] ever arrived. And you know exactly
[3:18:30] what's in that need and what's in that
[3:18:32] heart and what's in that life. And we're
[3:18:35] asking you, Lord Jesus, right now to
[3:18:37] come and speak peace to a troubled
[3:18:40] water, to a place where there's a storm.
[3:18:43] Speak
[3:18:45] peace. Speak life.
[3:18:52] When I said that, I in my in my spirit's
[3:18:54] eye, I could just see churning waters,
[3:18:57] waters just
[3:18:59] bubbling, un unsettled water, choppy
[3:19:02] waters. Yes. And somebody no doubt feels
[3:19:06] that way right now, but I I want you to
[3:19:08] know he's the peace speaker.
[3:19:12] And he may, you may think and feel that
[3:19:14] he's asleep, but I want you to know in
[3:19:16] just the right moment, he has a word.
[3:19:19] Hallelujah. He has a word to calm the
[3:19:21] troubled waters of your inner man.
[3:19:23] Hallelujah.
[3:19:27] Another thing that God did at Shàuote is
[3:19:30] he he reversed the curse of confusion
[3:19:34] that fell at Babel. Yeah. And he let
[3:19:37] people hear their language by the spirit
[3:19:40] being spoken by men that had never
[3:19:42] learned it. And God said, "I'm I'm I'm
[3:19:45] bringing clarity to the chaos a and I'm
[3:19:48] giving some truth to replace the
[3:19:50] confusion." Maybe you need some of that
[3:19:52] right now. Maybe you need some clarity
[3:19:55] uh with some different issues in your
[3:19:57] life. Father, I thank you right now that
[3:19:59] as we agree together in faith, you have
[3:20:02] a voice
[3:20:04] that can speak into the depth of our
[3:20:06] heart and bring clarity where there is
[3:20:10] confusion. Hallelujah.
[3:20:13] And
[3:20:14] direction where there is chaos.
[3:20:19] [Music]
[3:20:20] Mondo reekisa. You're a
[3:20:23] healer. You're a deliverer.
[3:20:26] You're a Holy Ghost refiller.
[3:20:30] You're a peace speaker.
[3:20:32] Peace to the storm. Peace to the trouble
[3:20:35] water.
[3:20:38] Comfort to those who feel
[3:20:43] comfortless. You're a great big
[3:20:45] God. We honor you today. We honor you
[3:20:48] today. We honor you
[3:20:55] today. But it's all about you.
[3:20:59] It's all about you, Jesus. Now, let's
[3:21:03] thank you. Coming back to the heart of
[3:21:08] worship
[3:21:10] where it's all about you. Yes. It's all
[3:21:15] about you, Jesus. I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
[3:21:20] Lord, for the things I made. It's not
[3:21:24] about me. When it's all about you, about
[3:21:27] my problem. It's about you, Lord. It's
[3:21:29] all about you. It's not about my
[3:21:32] feelings. I'm coming back to the heart
[3:21:37] of
[3:21:39] worship where it's all about you.
[3:21:43] It's all about you,
[3:21:47] Jesus. And I'm sorry, Lord, for the
[3:21:51] things I've
[3:21:53] made when it's all about you.
[3:21:58] It's all about you, Jesus. One more
[3:22:01] time. I'm coming back to the heart of
[3:22:07] worship where it's all about you.
[3:22:12] It's all about you,
[3:22:15] Jesus. And I'm sorry for the things I've
[3:22:21] made it. And it's all about
[3:22:26] you. It's all about you, Jesus.
[3:22:31] God bless you. Would you reach over and
[3:22:33] love somebody as you leave today? You're
[3:22:35] dismissed to go in the name of the Lord.
[3:22:37] I hope you don't hate your preacher for
[3:22:39] going so long. Tuesday night at 7
[3:22:43] o'clock, we'll come back to worship the
[3:22:45] Lord. Next Saturday and Sunday, we'll
[3:22:47] have a special time of fellowship and
[3:22:49] meetings together. You are dismissed,
[3:22:52] but I want us to sing as you go
[3:22:54] out.
[3:22:56] Uh Lord, send the power. Let's sing that
[3:23:00] really quickly as you're going out
[3:23:02] today. They were in an upper chamber.
[3:23:04] They were all in one accord. God bless
[3:23:06] you, darling.
[3:23:08] They were in an upper
[3:23:11] chamber. They were all in one
[3:23:15] accord when the Holy Ghost
[3:23:19] descended as was promised by our
[3:23:23] Lord. And oh Lord, send the power just
[3:23:28] now. Oh Lord, send the power just now.
[3:23:32] Oh Lord, send the power just now. and
[3:23:37] baptize
[3:23:39] everyone. Yes, this power from heaven
[3:23:43] descended to our fathers who were
[3:23:47] true. It is promised to
[3:23:51] believers and we all must have it too.
[3:23:55] I'm singing, oh Lord, send the power
[3:23:59] just now. Oh Lord, send the power just
[3:24:04] now. Oh Lord, send the power just now
[3:24:08] and baptize
[3:24:11] everyone. Yes, this old time power was
[3:24:15] given to our fathers who were true. It
[3:24:20] is promised to
[3:24:23] believers and we all may have it too.
[3:24:27] I'm singing, oh Lord, send the power.
[3:24:32] Oh Lord, send the power just now. Oh
[3:24:37] Lord, send the power just now.
[3:24:41] Baptize everyone. One more time. Oh. Oh
[3:24:45] Lord, send the power just now. I'm
[3:24:48] singing. Oh Lord, send the power just
[3:24:51] now. Oh Lord, send the power just now.

[3:24:59] everyone. I'm singing. Oh Lord, send the
[3:25:03] power just now. Oh Lord, send the power
