[0:00] The bride is not about destruction.
[0:04] Our ministry is not about destruction.
[0:08] The bride's ministry is about building.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; We're building something. Not the
[0:14] kingdom of William Brham.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; Not the kingdom of men.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; No.
[0:20] &gt;&gt; But the kingdom of our God,
[0:23] &gt;&gt; the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[0:26] There is a time to tear down. There is a
[0:29] time to destroy, but we're not in the
[0:32] destroying time now. We're in the
[0:35] building up hour.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; Sometimes things have to be ripped all
[0:39] the way down to the foundation so that
[0:42] you can check to see that you're
[0:45] building on a foundation that will take
[0:47] you all the way through.
[0:50] &gt;&gt; But our commission is to build.
[0:54] &gt;&gt; We're building in the spirit. We're
[0:56] building an atmosphere where he can come
[0:59] Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:02] and forever. We are called and
[1:05] commissioned to carry a burden and to
[1:08] have a common vision among us. Where
[1:12] there is no vision, singularly vision.
[1:17] Where there is no vision, King James
[1:21] translated the verse to say where there
[1:24] is no vision, the people
[1:28] &gt;&gt; perish.
[1:30] I wished he would have taken a closer
[1:32] look at the word
[1:34] &gt;&gt; because that word doesn't only mean
[1:36] perish. It means before they perish,
[1:40] they cast off restraint.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; No standards,
[1:50] &gt;&gt; no boundaries,
[1:53] &gt;&gt; no convictions.
[1:56] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm going to preach it.
[1:59] &gt;&gt; Just every man does that which is right
[2:01] in his own eyes.
[2:03] &gt;&gt; And every man gets to choose for his own
[2:06] house. And it doesn't matter what they
[2:08] do over at the church. It doesn't matter
[2:10] what they believe at the church. It
[2:12] doesn't matter what they've given their
[2:14] lives to over there. I I get to make the
[2:17] decisions in my home. And so we will
[2:19] live contrary.
[2:22] &gt;&gt; We'll live a different way.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; It sounds to me like a compromise
[2:28] of high level
[2:30] &gt;&gt; because where there is no vision,
[2:33] &gt;&gt; the people perish. and they perish
[2:36] because they've cast off restraint.
[2:40] &gt;&gt; The people of Israel had settled into
[2:44] Persia and they had picked up Babylonian
[2:48] ways. They were comfortable in this land
[2:51] of exile and in this land of confusion
[2:56] because the word Babel means confusion,
[3:00] confusing language, confusing speech.
[3:04] And they had settled in and only little
[3:07] handfuls of people had followed the
[3:10] example of Ezra and had made that
[3:14] journey back. When they were captured
[3:18] out of Jerusalem, there were no
[3:20] airplanes to get them from Jerusalem to
[3:24] Shushan in Persia. They marched in
[3:27] chains, chained one to another,
[3:31] prisoners of exile. They get to uh to
[3:36] Babylon and they are eventually given
[3:40] some freedom, we could say. Uh as long
[3:43] as you serve the kingdom empire, you you
[3:46] won't be exactly slaves. You won't be
[3:50] exactly
[3:52] free. Hear me? You won't be exactly
[3:55] free, but you won't be exactly slaves
[3:58] either. So, you won't just go and come
[4:01] as you will. But a little freedom
[4:05] is better than no freedom.
[4:08] Do you know what that sounds like to me
[4:09] today? The condition
[4:12] of many places.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; May God help it not to be the condition
[4:16] of this place. Amen.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; Got just enough freedom to to make you
[4:20] comfortable
[4:22] &gt;&gt; to cause you to want to stay in
[4:24] confusion,
[4:25] &gt;&gt; but not enough longing.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; Not enough longing in your heart for
[4:31] Jerusalem.
[4:34] &gt;&gt; So, you just live in Persia with your
[4:38] Babylonian ways. Oh, it's nice to hear
[4:40] stories from home.
[4:43] I hear the Jews are there. I hear they
[4:45] hide during the day.
[4:48] I hear they're afraid because they're
[4:51] still occupying forces of of several
[4:54] different dynasties that roam the ruins
[4:56] of Jerusalem. And so the Jews are mostly
[4:59] in and out hiding.
[5:02] But oh, at least at least some of our
[5:04] brothers are in the city and they go on
[5:07] living their life, spending their
[5:08] paycheck, enjoying their freedom, which
[5:12] is really slavery in disguise.
[5:16] &gt;&gt; They've been made twofold children of
[5:17] hell. Just enough freedom to keep them
[5:20] from doing all the things they did in
[5:22] sin,
[5:24] &gt;&gt; but not enough freedom to give them
[5:25] victory over those vices and those uh
[5:28] little pet sins and little foxes and not
[5:32] enough victory to cause them to speak
[5:34] with integrity and truth all the time.
[5:38] &gt;&gt; I wasn't looking for a church. This is
[5:41] to be a place of revival.
[5:44] &gt;&gt; It's to be a revival ministry. It's to
[5:47] be a revival center. It's supposed to be
[5:50] a house of deliverance.
