TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] oh praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the broadcast today and tell you what a privilege it is to be able to come to you in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ I hope that something will be said today that will inspire your faith maybe give you a little encourage encouragement to keep pressing on toward the kingdom of God I want to remind you that Jesus loves you he sees you where you are he knows your need he's waiting on you just to surrender that need to him take your hands off of it and let God take charge let him be in control you know so many times we come to the Lord with burdens and we say Lord I'm giving you my burden I'm giving you this need and we maybe kneel at the altar and lay it before him and when we get up we pick it up and take it home with us I want to encourage you not to do that I want you to know that the Lord is standing near right now ready to take your burden ready to carry your need if you'll just absolutely in faith turn loose of it and let God be in full control he is so faithful he never makes a mistake he never forgets one of his own he will in every situation come through for us if we can just believe only believe all things are possible and I believe that we are studying together the difference I guess between intellectual faith and Faith by Revelation a mental concept of believing and a spiritual revelation of belief um I think the difference is trust and I think one of the reasons why we so desperately need a clear Revelation from the Lord that our faith can be anchored in a revelatory truth is I think the main reason why we need that is so that we can trust so that we can really trust that the Lord will take care of it all and we'll talk about that uh in this session and maybe one more uh we are studying Peter we've been talking about the transition of Peter's Faith from a mental concept to a pure Revelation and at the end of the broadcast the last time we were together I was sharing with you a story that warms my heart a story of one of God's generals William brandham we refer to him out of respect and love as brother brandham because his life and Ministry has been such an inspiration in my own life and in my own Ministry and I was sharing sharing with you how that uh in the great Ohio flood many years ago brother brandom lost his wife and his baby girl and he was left to take care of a little baby boy all by himself he's standing by the gravide very very distraught and missing his wife and little girl so much and a man pulls up and begins to talk to brother brandom and he asked him did you hold on to your faith did you hold on to your religion during this awful time of loss and brother brandom just simply replied no it held on to me and I wanted to start the program the same way we ended the last program by reminding you that that's the kind of faith I'm talking about the kind of faith that holds you when you don't have enough strength to hold on it holds on to you and in finishing that story he gives one more uh very special statement that I really have enjoyed so much he said I was tied to him in the hours when my strength was gone and there was nothing that I could do so many times there are circumstances that there's nothing that we can do to change them and brother brandom said my anchor held within the veil of his word Yonder and I want you and I to come to that place where no matter what happens we can say my faith is anchored in the word of God out there it is holding on behind the veil even though I can't always see what it's attached to you know sometimes we we mentioned last week God is silent there are times in the middle of our crisis when we want so desperately to hear from God and it seems that we cannot and you may remember that I mentioned that in those times when God seems to be silent it almost seems that the devil has more to say and he just talks and talks and talks trying to discourage you trying to fill your life with hopelessness and despair but it may be that you have to shut him up you have to take authority over him you have to do what our lord Jesus did in his own Temptation in the wilderness Satan it is written you shall not tempt the Lord thy God or man shall not live by bread alone some verse of scripture that that fits that applies to the situation that you're going through at that particular moment that's one thing I love so much about the printed record of God's word the the Bible is because there's always a scripture somewhere that can speak to my need and I'm I'm amazed at how often the holy spirit will lead us when we're looking through the Bible reading through the Bible and how he will just direct us to the right little verse that just speaks to the need and speaks to our present circumstances and again this is why I feel like it's so important to let the holy spirit of God reveal the truth of the scripture to you until it becomes a part of who you are so that in death in grief in loss in tragedy whatever the situation is you've got something holding on to you when you feel like you can't hold on to him there's so many uh other uh aspects to this that I want to bring in as we try to bring this study to a close and one of those is if our faith is only a mental faith if it's only a an intellectual concept uh and not real trust and not real Spirit revealed Faith then what often happens is the enemy comes in with reasonings uh and we often get caught up when our soul begins to reason and and there will be all these elaborate excuses and reasoning that start flooding our mind and we have to take authority over uh and bring uh into captivity every thought that will exalt itself against the sovereignty uh of the Lord Jesus Christ and and his absolute ability to deliver all of these things start coming and the Soul starts crying out with reasonings and that's why intellectual Faith Can can actually be deceiving sometime because it is based on information and perceived facts or a perception of a fact what I'm trying to say is there are times that our faith cannot be based on fact alone it has to be based on something Beyond the Veil something Beyond uh natural vision in other words in those moments when there seems to be no reason to Hope but we hope in way um when everything is so discouraging and and the details and it seems like every day the story just gets worse and worse and yet there's something inside of you that's moving in the opposite direction when you when you would almost feel like giving up and yet there's something inside of you that says I will not give up I will keep pressing toward the lord and that is so important for us to understand that our faith cannot be based in facts alone alone because the fact may be that you have an incurable heart condition uh the fact may be that divorce is imminent uh the fact may be that your children are running away from God but my faith cannot be based in that fact alone my faith has to be based on something else the absolute word of God uh the word of God that is revealed to us by the Holy Spirit and so uh sometimes we have to just make up our mind uh I'm not going to read the news I I'm not going to listen to what the world says around me I'm going to shut myself in uh to the promises of God I'm going to hide underneath the arms the the wings the psalmist David talks about hiding under his wings and underneath his feathers and and you know what that's exactly where we need to be sometime just underneath the Lord's wings uh just let him gather us up I love that I love that analogy and I can see it so often um I've learned about the eagle a lot and I I love the eagle and uh we were just blessed a few a few weeks ago to have a a an eagle visit us here on our Campground and um we we've seen them the last few years uh a couple of eagles circling over the parking lot but it had been many years since uh I actually saw an eagle that was perched in a tree and uh a couple Sunday mornings back one of our brothers saw this big beautiful Eagle perched in a tree and we all went out and enjoyed it so much because the property that God gave us where our church is and where I'm speaking to you from right now he told us many years ago that we should name this property Eagle's refuge and so we believe it is a refuge for some of God's Eagles and do you know spirit filled and prophetic Le people are often referred to in the Bible uh as an eagle and and so I like that analogy and we learn about the eagle uh when the little baby eagle is learning to fly that the mother sometimes even the father uh I think but generally the mother will take the little eaglets out to to test their wings and to learn how to fly and how to navigate the currents of the wind and they start out sometime by the little eaglets holding on to the back of its mother and and sometimes has to use its beak and and little Talons to hold on to the back of his mother and then there comes a time where she just drops them and and lets them uh begin to try to fly and set their wings for themselves but they tell us that there are five primary feathers on the end of uh of the Eagle's Wings and those feathers can be rotated in a certain direction that creates a centrifugal type Force so that if that little baby eaglet gets too far away from Mother's care she just starts rotating those wing tips and it creates almost like a suction that pulls that little baby eaglet right back up under the mother you know what I like that and I don't mind that at all I'm so grateful to serve a living God who loves me so much that if I should get a little too confident or get a little too far from him that he has the ability just to draw me a at his own will draw me right back up underneath him for protection from harm and from the elements um and so just remember that you can't always base how you feel on what you know with a mental concept because again the facts can be awful Grim but sometimes we have to take those things into consideration but also look to the Unseen look to the things that we cannot see and know that God is working behind the scene to bring everything uh into our lives for our good now that doesn't mean that everything that happens to us is good but everything that happens to us happens to us for our good and not for our harm and you know the Bible said uh uh I have good plans for you God has good plans for you to prosper you and to strengthen you uh especially uh when we are completely and totally surrendered our our lives are laid down for the sake of the Lord Jesus Christ and so in those times when facts contradict Spirit revealed Faith what are you going to go with what the facts say or what God's word has said I I think if I were you every time I would choose God's word and that's why we need that Revelation because even the Bible can be like facts to us that we're not connected to but when the spirit reveals the word to us uh it becomes more than a fact it becomes a living reality one that we can hold on to when there seems to be no logical reason to keep holding on people get often times caught up in the facts here's a scripture that's a bit unusual in the book of 1 Timothy chap 1 and verse 4 it says neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies which minister questions rather than Godly edifying which is in faith so do and I'd like to read that in the complete Jewish Bible another version of the Bible it says have them stop devoting their attention to myths and NeverEnding genealogies these divert people to speculating instead of doing God's work which requires trust I think that Dr David Stern did an amazing job in his translation of that verse I like it so much I want to read it again is that okay have them stop devoting their attention to myths and NeverEnding genealogies these divert people to speculating instead of doing God's work which requires trust I'm amazed sometimes at how people get so caught up with all kinds of conspiracy theories and all kinds of ideas uh that people just get so obsessed with and and they spend all of their time digging and researching uh this Scandal and that conspiracy theory and that idea and that approach and they give their lives to those kinds of things it becomes such a diversion it becomes such a distraction and I like the way this is translated uh don't don't give yourself to those things there may be questions even in Scripture that that we can't completely understand on our own we cry out to God for more understanding and for Revelation but we're not going to be caught up in those things to the point of of doubting or to the point of being distracted we're going to continue to do God's work we're going to continue to trust him we're going to continue to believe that he is more than able to keep that which we have committed unto him against that day uh that's what we're going to have to do we're just absolutely going to have to do that I I hope you don't mind if I share uh another uh quotation here from a sermon of brother brandham that I love so deeply I I don't often do that here on the on the Eagle's cry but but I love it so much that I have to believe that somebody out there will love it as much as I do uh he is ministering he had this great gift god-given gift to be able to often discern the heart to know what the need was and God would use him uh in so many different ways sometimes God would even reveal to him someone's name and their doctor's name and what their disease was and how long they had suffered with it why would God do such a thing well it it really elevates the faith level in the room not only for the individual being prayed for but also for the whole corporate body when you see God personally dealing with someone um when you realize and recognize that God really does know your need he really knows your situation um it releases an anointing often times on your faith it just gets you know kicked up to another notch and I love hearing some of these prayer lines where brother would pray for people and there was a particular disturbance in this service uh during a time of prayer and he said it is a devil there's a devil here a demon spirit and I like this he said he knows his time has come and so in the service he was trying to cause a disturbance this evil spirit because he knew that God was about to deal with him once and for all and so uh brother Bram starts looking down and he he calls out a woman and he said you're extremely nervous aren't you lady just hysterically nervous I see you trying to do things and you just can't because you're so nervous you have a mental nervous condition uh and Satan is even told you you're going to lose your mind there may be someone watching this broadcast right now that Satan has told you the same thing you're just going to lose your mind and you feel overwhelmed with anxiety and you you almost believe what he says but brother random said but he lied to you lady and then he looks at another woman in the crowd he said that little lady sitting right there second one on the right she's also bothered with nervousness isn't that right lady and she answers and and he says to this which I really like this demon knows that if that woman will have way believe Jesus Christ the son of God and me his prophet that'll have to leave her now that is so contrary to what we've been taught about faith and and that's why so many people get this idea when they don't see their prayers answered when healing doesn't come as quickly as we'd like for it to come we think I don't have enough Faith what's wrong with my faith or or perhaps we pray for a loved one who is sick and eventually that loved one dies and we're so grieved and we torment ourselves with guilt and we get in in our minds I didn't have enough Faith oh if I would have just had enough Faith but I want you to know that sometimes that is not this the truth of the situation at all not the reality at all it's only our perception because often times according to what this man of God ministered to this woman if I can just get that woman to halfway believe it it's not it's not 100% Faith but but just trying to believe you know putting her faith in that right direction then that thing will have to leave her and then brother brandom says that demon in that's troubling this woman and the demon that's troubling that other woman they're calling out to one another for help because again they knew their time had come and they said uh he said they're trying to get help to accumulate unbelief but he has lost the battle you see unbelief Works similar to Faith in the sense that in a room a a demon Spirit can come in with accusation and and in a good spirit meeting where God is trying to have his way and a demon Spirit an evil spirit can come in with unbelief and with doubt and with accusation and that Spirit cries out to another spirit and and who cries out to another Spirit until uh until doubt and unbelief get stronger in the building than faith and that ought not to be we we ought to have authority over that in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I believe we do and all of a sudden brother brandom said faith is gathering and that is a a statement that I love so dearly because here the enemy was trying to accumulate unbelief he was trying to fill up the room with doubt and all of a sudden just by saying that it caused the Believers in the room to start pulling on the Lord oh Father oh God bring Deliverance to these women uh set these women free oh Father and just the faith pool the faith pull the pool of their faith caused Faith to gather in the room and in a in an atmosphere of gathered Faith anything can happen because Jesus steps in to an atmosphere of gathered faith and he comes down to begin to pray for that woman he tells her many things about her life that I won't even take your time to read right now but he ends up by saying I challenge you in the name of Jesus Christ you selfish ungodly Spirit to a duel of Faith now that's a powerful statement because this demon Spirit and the servant of the Lord the servant of the Lord challenges that Spirit to a duel of Faith see I showed you in the Book of James that even Devils even demon Spirits believe they believe and tremble the Bible said but their belief system is absolutely 100% uh intellectual it is a mental concept of believing but this servant of the Lord had more than a mental concept of Faith he had Spirit reveal Faith whose Faith do you think was going to win that evil spirit who believed that he could continue to trouble that woman or this servant of the Lord who had seen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever proving himself time and time again see his faith was based on that I know whose Faith would win yours just like his if your faith is is assurance and Trust because you have seen because you know by Revelation that God is able to do exceedingly abundantly above anything which we could even ask or think your faith is going to win every time it will win every time that devil will not be able to stand against you so he challenges this demon Spirit to a duel of faith and then he says you're exposed come out of this woman in jesus' name and then he turns to the woman go in peace my daughter and may God be with you and bless you he didn't say let me get your name down so I can send it out in my newsletter let me snap a picture with you so I can promote my Ministry he just said go your way the Lord has made you whole I love that I know this was a special servant of the Lord but I want you to know you and I can operate in this kind of Faith Lord do it so anoint our faith in this moment Lord that we can believe you even for the impossible our faith can't rest in just the history of what God did 50 60 years ago our faith has to rest in the fact that he is the same Hebrews 13 and8 I quoted it just a moment ago he is the same yesterday today and forever brother brandham taught that even the Rapture the catching away of the saints of God is a revelation and it comes by faith God reveals this whole Rapture mystery because even in this moment we're being caught up in the spirit uh absolutely I believe in a physical catching away but I also believe that there's preparation going on in the bride right now to get us ready uh mentally spiritually it uh um on the inside there's a transformation or taking place even a Rapture taking place but it will culminate in the physical Gathering of the Saints of the most high God so I cannot overemphasize enough to you how desperately we need Revelation in our lives I think I just want to take this time now as we leave the program to today to pray for you again that God will give you some real Supernatural Revelation from his word father I thank you right now that you've given me this great privilege to minister into the lives and the homes of those who are watching this program right now we come to you in faith believing that you are the same yesterday today and forever knowing that if you ever healed the sick body when you were on this Earth nearly 2,000 years ago that that you can still heal the sick today if you ever raised a person from the dead and I know you did you are more than able to continue with resurrection power so I ask that you will pour down the holy spirit of God upon us until our belief our faith our mental concept of what we believe is so super anointed and so charged with the resurrection power of Jesus Christ that it becomes such a revelation that it holds us that it moves us and that we go forward in that Faith to do great things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray God bless you thank you for watching the Eagles cry tune in again next time bye-bye for [Music] [Applause] [Music] now [Music] all
