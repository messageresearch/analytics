tough anyway but what would it be if he wasn't holding us why don't you give him another hand clap of Praise oh he's worthy [Applause] he's so worthy you may be seated just a moment he's worthy I saw yesterday that Paul had posted a picture with his mom and I said to my wife I said do you reckon sister West is uh Paul is up there with sister West I didn't know it was the other way around we're sure glad to see you this morning so glad what a surprise she's like some of the other seniors here who can testify something keeps holding them and we know what it is it's the hand of the Lord Kade that was a superb song for those of you that don't know that was fresh from Heaven it only came two days ago and he put that together in time for this morning let's thank God for that gift anyone who has ever known the religious struggle knows what it feels like to try to walk on water that's what we try to do sometime and I think even the prophet told us that God wasn't looking for that he wasn't looking for people who walk on water doesn't mean it wouldn't be great if we needed to walk on water that'd be all right but I think sometimes we think we have to be something that we're just we're just not and we just need him it's not about religious performance it's about daily surrendering in sincerity and honesty and and in truth walking before God in integrity and he does the rest he does the rest I'm thankful for the blood today aren't you we're blessed I want you to know that camp meeting is coming up and uh I was hoping to to have some really good news for you this morning about the about the uh the air conditioning but it didn't didn't come together just like we thought yet but we believe that it's going to very shortly and we'll have good news about that uh we're thankful for the one unit for sure uh Brother G is not here to give you a report but he's uh in Virginia and uh just so happened that his dad was going going to be away so he was also able to preach for his dad this morning I've been in touch with him I think he texted me before I know it was before 7 o'clock we were texting each other and um God is good he's just good um but we know for sure that the uh sheetrock has been uh finished hung and finished in the in the bathrooms and uh we're bless less by that there may be some I mean maybe more I don't know exactly what else has to be done but they they were there working a couple days this week and it sure makes a difference when you go in and you can no longer see through the walls I mean it it really looks real then and um we're probably not going to do too much to the leftand wall because we're we're not expecting to keep it very long it's just uh the sheetrock will help insulate it and and we're hoping to to eventually take in another section of the Tabernacle cuz we're going to need it for what's about to come we're we're going to see some things we are seeing some things but there is a squeeze coming on it's coming on and uh depending on the election it may come sooner than what we think so we need to be ready we need to be so full of everything that can be found in Christ that when people come looking for something you've got it you don't have to you don't have to go pray it down but you're already carrying the deposit of strength and Glory that folks are going to need in the trying days that are ahead for our nation God has been good to us and he will continue to take care of his own but it may be some tough times are ahead and it's going to put us together it's going to pull us together that's what the prophet told this is what the scripture tells us we're going to be pressed together squeezed together so we better learn to get along while we still have some Elbow Room because when we get squeezed together we can't get away from each other aren't you glad sometime when you can Retreat to another place from the crowd I am but we may not have that pleasure in days to come I don't ever want you to judge somebody else's praise especially if you don't have any I don't want you to judge anybody else's praise that what they do is between them and the Lord uh Jennifer was enjoying some victory this morning and and uh I couldn't help but see it and and the thought really blessed me because I know that she has had a rough week and so what do you do do you come in with your face dragging down some of some of you do with your face dragging down like you have nothing to live for or do you come in and just make up your mind it's getting a little tight in here already do you just make up your mind I'm going to praise him because he's worthy we better do it that way it brings us to a personal level of Victory so God bless you Sister as long as I have anything to say about it I don't care if it's fast or slow it doesn't matter to me how people worship as long as they're doing it unto the Lord I'm not going to I don't even want to be a part of a place that there can't be some Liberty when Liberty is so needed he whom the son makes free is what free indeed free indeed so uh concerning camp meeting I have some news for you and that is we have invited brother Dwayne Jackson to come and speak for us Brother David Templeton is going to come and speak for us uh brother um rers is going to speak the first night for us from South Africa and uh then brother gy and I will each take a service the Lord willing uh brother Dwayne will probably have two Services Brother David will probably have one but all of it is just really up to the Holy Ghost whatever he wants is what we want and um you know I'm not interested in getting caught up in that top 10 preacher thing and feeling like you can't have camp meeting without a certain speaker coming to preach uh we can have camp meeting anytime we make up our mind to come and celebrate the Lord amen but we have been greatly blessed by Brother Jackson's Ministry in the past and Brother David Templeton has become a quick friend and we're very thankful some of you have been to his services and you know that God is using him in the valley just right up the hill there right up the road and we're very thankful for that and for his testimony God has touched his body in a profound way and we are very thankful of that so uh we'll be getting an announcement out uh probably during the week we're just waiting on the final uh okay from the Lord for the theme couple things are in my heart I want to know that we've chosen what he has on his heart and then no no preacher is obligated to preach by the theme you you you know they we want them to be led of the lord we just try to have something to kind of focus on as we come together so October 15th through the 20th and we'll be getting together to feed the folks and to take care of all those who are coming and uh some have I know at least two or three airbnbs have already been rented in the area for groups that are coming and so we're going to have a wonderful number of saints most of all God is going to be with us amen today is sister Beth pok's birthday and they haven't been in a little while we want to lift her up to the Lord and uh wish her a happy birthday and and if you can contact and reach out and let them know we love them and we're praying for them and and uh especially wish her a happy birthday tomorrow that uh or today that would be nice tomorrow is Paul's birthday and if you've got access to him Facebook textt or whatever uh bombard him with birthday text would you do that I don't think sister Jennifer uh startis was rejoicing because it's her birthday I think she was rejoicing for victory but tomorrow is her birthday so we want to say happy birthday to sister Jennifer sister Anna Miller who's streaming the service we say happy birthday to her tomorrow and uh we love you we miss you God bless you and Ezekiel Ellsworth has a birthday tomorrow they're on the road coming home today I understand uh so how old will Ezekiel be four wow uh that just sure flew by in a hurry so if you remember Tuesday night if you see him you wish him a happy birthday uh Friday of this week is Hannah sa's birth birthday happy birthday Hannah coming [Applause] up Sister Deborah Gosman a streamer along with her husband her birthday is on Saturday God bless you Sister Deborah and Shiloh yovic and they are traveling they made it to Pennsylvania that's a long ride but they made it to Pennsylvania for a little time with family and uh so maybe if you can you could send a greeting to shalow sometimes we have no birthdays and then we got a week like this where we have lots tomorrow's also the Alano's wedding anniversary and we want to use that as an opportunity to pray for them I know you've been praying for them I know that uh I certainly appreciate that but let's keep praying for them the Lord is the Victor he has the last say he knows how to deliver he knows how to set free he knows how to show himself real he's a God who knows how to move in an undeniable way he can just move in such a way that you can't even deny that it's him ain't that great that's who he is and uh so I think that was all that we needed to say let's stand again get ready to go to the word something is holding me that's right that's exactly right would you just sing I don't know if you if you do this one Kate but if we could just sing the Little Chorus will give the glory to Jesus uh while we're getting ready for the word do you know what key bethl we give the glory to Jesus and tell of his love and tell of his love oh will give give the glory to Jesus and we'll tell of his wonderful love can we give him the glory today we give all the glory to Jesus woo it belongs to him and we'll tell of his love we will tell of his love we will give give all the glory to Jesus and we will tell of his wonderful love amen amen amen Lord the glory belongs to you it belongs to you Jesus we want you to have the honor and the glory and the praise give him another one come on hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God Amen let's give the musicians a great thank you praise God [Applause] amen Joseph is just improving uh he was always doing good but he's just getting better and better on the drums and we appreciate him and and everyone every person that uh helps us and uh don't let's not take for granted the the pitiful overworked uh computer projector Runners not just charity but but all of them poor Austin he he needs lots of prayer and help and strength he gets so he gets so nervous he's so afraid I'm going to bite his head off or something but it's a it's a job because you know if if if I did things like other people and got a whole got a whole series at one time that'd be different but I keep adding to it and I give them a new document every week and then they got to figure out when I call for it they got to figure out where goes so always be patient with even the song pullers uh uh Miss Olivia Ellsworth does a great job and and Jennifer's helped us so many times and Mariah different ones thank you for it the running of the sound and the stream and the camera and all all that it takes every effort that somebody makes blowing the leaves picking up the trash cutting the grass trimming the Hedge is everything that you do just keep in mind you are doing it unto the Lord It's your offering to him cleaning the church and he will bless you he will reward you I I just I'm very thankful for every one of you this morning would you turn to Hebrews chapter 13 beginning in verse S and 8 now I want you to know from the the onset that I have not tailored this sermon for any situation that you may or may not be aware of in the last few weeks I'm saying that because when I do my outline I gave these definitions of of the behaviors that sometimes manifest in the presence of a familiar spirit I gave them that weeks ago and we're just working our way through each definition and so I want you to know that we're just to this place this is the next definition that I gave and it's not directed to anybody it's directed to everybody that is just the truth it's not a particular easy subject for me but the reality is if I don't say this no one else will I mean it really is a truth no one else really will will will use these quotes and so I'm going to do it this morning because I believe it's what I'm supposed to do but pray for me it makes me a bit uncomfortable Hebrews chap 13 verse 7 and 8 remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever it's always been a bit of a mystery to me why in the middle of Paul's instruction to the new Believers the Jewish believers who have become aware of Messiah he is instructing them to honor and to respect those that have been called to speak the words of life to them and then the next phrase Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever the reality is the apostle is drawing the connection and he is saying that Jesus is still talking and still moving and still present among his people what he did he's still doing and he may use a different voice he may use different vessels but it's him and we're thankful that he hasn't changed with so many of our folks missing this morning it sure was wonderful to have uh brother Austin and and Hannah holwell and Miss Natalie who just had a birthday uh and and uh little Eli it was so wonderful to have them come in we're thankful I want you to now look at Hebrews 13 that was Hebrews 137 and 8 now I want to look at Hebrews 1317 and 18 same chapter just dropping down some verses obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for who for for you is what the scripture said I pray for us he goes on to say for we trust that we have a good conscience in all things willing to live honestly I want to live honestly before the Lord don't you I want to live with Integrity before the Lord at the end of the day when I lay my head on the pillow I don't want to have to do any getting right why wait till you go to bed to get right I want to live to be right and I want to repent through the day when I realize that I've been wrong and let the Lord take care of it he is he is uh longsuffering and he has a lot of tender patience toward us father we are so thankful for your presence among us today the wonderful faces of your people who have come to worship you in spirit and in truth we're not here because we don't have troubles or that or we don't have distractions or we don't have needs we're here with all of that we're here because we honor you and we love you and we want to worship you and we want to show up for you we need you Lord now to help us with this word today break it down in our hearts and in our Spirits if if anything uh in this series has stirred a devil today this surely will but we are asking you to come show your presence so real so strong that we are arrested by the truth and it's For Your Glory that we keep on keeping on in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the the Saints said amen you may be seated Paul said remember remember the word remember there in Greek and I think you have that is to keep in mind to focus on the dramatic aspect of remembrance it means to mention it means to exercise memory to recollect also to rehearse when the Apostle Paul said remember them who have rule over you who have spoken unto you the word of God you're not following a man you're following Faith he said who Faith follow the example is not in the humanity of the man it's not in brother branham's Humanity that we trust it's not in the humanity of our pastor that we trust and these verses are not talking about government leaders this is not our president this is not our boss on the job there are other verses of scripture that can apply to that but this is speaking specifically about those who Feed Us in spiritual matters if Paul is telling us us to remember them he's saying mention them focus on the dramatic aspect of Remembrance in the messages that brother brandham preached about respects he always mentioned to us that it's not whether a man is worthy of respect or not it's not the individual that we honor and respect it's not it's the office it's the office that that man would hold whether he be a pastor or a or a teacher or an evangelist or whatever his particular role would be we have made our way through some of the behaviors and expressions of the presence of a familiar Spirit the kind of demons that run through generational lines and through Bloodlines and through dnas and we have talked about various ways that they manifest today we're going to look at Authority issues if you'll give me that definition Authority issues one of the ways let me make sure we're all together one of the ways that we can detect the presence of a familiar Spirit that's never been dealt with that has moved through a family line is when that Spirit shows up consistently to have issues with authority now the definition of authority issues is consistent conflict with I'll let you help me read it god-given Authority an inability to cope with others influence over you a problem taking advice a fear of being a follower almost always stemming from past painful experiences always expressing a lack of trust in leadership and often dropping subtle hints that reflect negatively on a pastor or leader Maybe maybe you know someone like that maybe you've been someone like that if indeed that is a consistent behavior in someone's life that you are connected with it could be a clear sign that a familiar spirit is operating in that family that needs to be dealt with I'm going to read the definition again I'm going to read it slow because I want you to focus on whatever part of that might speak to you Authority issues con consistent conflict with god-given authority an inability to cope with others influence over you a problem taking advice a fear of being a follower almost always stemming listen from past painful experiences when when a person has had a bad experience with a boyfriend or with a husband and it's not completely been resolved and healed in the realm of a spirit in the realm of the spirit it can often be something that is passed on to another generation a a hatred a prejudice against all men do you understand if if a woman has had a bad marriage she's been abused she's been mistreated there is a strong possibility that she begins to subconsciously look at all men like the man that abused her they call that in Psychology a defense mechanism I understand the psychology of it don't you I understand how someone can come to a place when someone you loved and cherished who was supposed to protect you instead abused you and neglected you and cheated on you and betrayed you and let you down that may have happened to to a a woman more than once it could have happened several times in a row it could be the life story of a of a female a life story it could have started with her father it could have moved to a stepfather it could have been an uncle then a boyfriend then another boyfriend then it could have been a husband then it might have been another husband then it's a boss on a job making unwelcome advances and abusing his authority and then another job with another boss who has the same behavior the next thing you know the brain starts trying to protect itself from that kind of repeated abuse and what forms in our mind in our mindset in our Paradigm is a distrust for all men unfortunately that doesn't always stop there it can move from generation to generation to generation it's things that are spoken it's behaviors that uh that are lived out in front of a a child who grows up not trusting even sometimes we parents can so warn our children about everybody being a boogeyman I know we're living in different hour I know we have to be careful but there are things we can do for instance sometimes people will will say to their children who are misbehaving in the mall they'll say oh there's a policeman I'm going to tell him he's going to take you to jail that may seem extremely cute to you but that's not cute you see you're passing something down to a small child that the policeman is there to haul them away to punish them for not uh walking right in the mall or behaving right in the mall do you understand there may come a time that that child needs to call on the help of a police officer and you wouldn't want to be building a Prejudice in their mind that that man's not out to help you that man's out to punish you that man's out to take you to jail I am convinced that the reason why we have defund the police movements in our nation is because a previous generation and a previous gener generation has dealt with those kinds of issues with authority now many of those folks have been mistreated they have been stereotyped they have been singled out because of the color of their skin or because of their religious affiliation and many have been mistreated abused beaten even murdered by Authority I know that it's history it can't be denied but we should not be guilty of passing on from generation to generation a general distrust of all authority there are going to be bad cops there are going to be bad preachers they are going to be sorry husbands they're going to be lousy boyfriends they're going to be boyfriends that are out for one thing only they're going to be bosses who will make uh sexual comments and and inuendos and and what do they call that in the in the workforce uh sexual harassment that's going to happen but what we need to remember is that all authority is not bad all police officers aren't out to drag you to jail when you're not guilty all pastors are not out to deceive you and lead you off and take all of your money away from you all husbands all boyfriend it's it's not right like to make such a generalized not only thought process but a statement and then pass it on to our children and their children and their children we need to make sure that we are teaching a balance for the Next Generation in all things yes there are many many people who have abused their Authority both god-given and government given but that doesn't mean that everybody does that's right I just need you to know where we are I want you to understand that we want to break the cycle not only the cycles of jealousy or resentment or Envy or bitterness but we want to break the cycle of raising children who believe that especially girls who believe that all men are out to get them there are many abusers but every man is not an abuser right there have been many stepdads who have abused their stepchildren but that doesn't mean that all stepdads are out to abuse their stepchildren there have been many dads that have abused their daughters but that doesn't mean that every dad struggles with the same issues or problems so we can't keep passing that kind of you know we could call it misinformation but it runs so much deeper into our lives that it becomes a role of iniquity and that iniquity because of a multitude of iniquity that has not been dealt with in our society and in our families the Bible said the love of many the love of many because iniquity abounds it didn't say because sin abounds didn't say because transgression abounds I I hope you're listening it says because iniquity abounds the love of many shall wax cold so if we can figure out why it is that we have issues with authority if we can find out why it is that we don't trust anybody we know it's because our trust has been broken we know it's because Authority has failed us it's certainly let us down do you believe that Paul was aware of those kind of abuses in Authority we know he was he was a Pharisee of Pharisees he saw what happens especially in the time of Yeshua he saw what happens when religious men abused their Authority he was familiar with the ways of the Pharisees and yet he said remember them which have the rule over you have who have spoken unto you the word of God whose Faith follow considering the end of their conversation Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever in the Amplified verse S and 8 reads like this remember your leaders and superiors in Authority for it was they who brought to you the word of God observe attentively and consider their manner of living the outcome of their well spent lives and do what imitate their faith King James says whose Faith follow that's the only translation that takes it follow their faith almost all the other translations go one step further instead of just saying follow they say imitate or emulate do what you can to be faithful as they were faithful if you get your mind on the man or the woman or whoever it is in leadership if you get your mind on them they'll fail you and you'll throw them out with the bath water right brother B said that's not what we do if they fail we pray for them if they let us down we pray for them brother banam in dealing with the pastor in fact he said if the pastor fails you I I if he mistreats you if he misses doing something for you that you needed him to do you pray for him he he said you don't put him out he said for instance in this church speaking of his own you you can't put the pastor out for something like that he said the bylaws he teaches that the bylaws of this church are only if he gets off the word as long as he stays on the word then he has a position and you honor the position and you pray for him when he fails you don't spread it you just pray for Ing we need prayer ministers need prayer pastors need prayer leaders need prayer the suicide rate among leaders in the church is higher than any service position more pastors take their lives than police officers more pastors take their lives than firemen or Rescue Squad workers it's it's their it's their inner struggle it's their their feeling of not being valued or appreciated that drives them and then they have struggles like every other man every other human being has struggles who are they going to talk to who are they going to get to pray for them who are they going to confess their weakness to it's really a system that that fails a lot of people who have to live on the Arro head and I'm not here I I want you to know I don't even even want to preach this to be totally honest with you because it seems so self-serving but since it was part of the notes and because I have observed I've even mentioned to my wife over the past few months that there is just a a disdain in our society for men I I mentioned that to you every Father's day since I've been here probably and we're living in a generation where fathers are just all considered Bart Simpsons just doofuses you know all they do is go to work and they don't care for their children and they don't take care of business they don't do anything you know they're just they just go to work and come home and or couch potatoes and the reality is that is so true in too many homes but I want you to know that there are Godly homes with Godly fathers with Godly men who are not having more children than they can emotionally minister to it's not just being a sperm donor there's a whole lot more to it than that they've got to be discipled and when you take on a family you take on their problems as well it's a big responsibility and it can't be neglected and so many times people uh resent if anyone tries to bring any kind of help or any kind of ministry because it causes them to feel guilty for not doing their role but that's not what this is about this is a family this is all men on Deck this is we're helping one another are you with me so he said remember your leaders and superiors in authority for it was they who brought to you the word of God observe attentively that's not sleeping in church you're not attentive if you're snoring just just for the record just just getting in there and consider their manner of living the outcome of their Wells spent lives and imitate their faith their conviction that God exists and is the Creator and ruler of all things the provider and bestow of Eternal salvation through Christ and they're leaning on the entire human personality of God in absolute trust and confidence in his power wisdom and goodness if you question that it actually comes right from the original because we have a high priest who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities because he condescended into a a man's body into a body of Flesh so that he could experience The Temptations and trials of humanity so that he could be a perfect intercessor on our behalf do you ever remind yourself of that do you ever say Lord I know you understand I do I've heard people pray God you just don't know what it's like he knows exactly what it's like he does and he planned it that way intentionally and then we drop down to Hebrews 13:17 and 18 in the Amplified and we just read it a moment ago in the King James it says obey I remember quite a discussion here some years ago over that word obey because some people were just sure it didn't mean obey just like some people are just sure that long hair doesn't mean uncut hair it just means longer than normal you understand we can reason away or we can try to get to the root of what it's really trying to tell us it says obey your spiritual leaders and submit to them continually recognizing their authority over you for they are constantly keeping watch over your souls and guarding your spiritual welfare as men who will have to listen who will have to render an account for their trust do your part to let them do this with gladness and not with sighing and groaning for that would not be profitable to you either you know one of the ways to keep a spiritual leader moving forward is to try to treat him in such a way that it's not a grief he doesn't dread seeing you coming every time you come sometimes you come just to say thank you sometimes you come just to say I was blessed sometimes you come just to say I just wanted to tell you brother everything's good in my life today amen if all you ever do is complain you're going to grieve your leaders that word obey in the Greek do you have that definition it means to let your heart be convinced to put trust in to rely on to have confidence in to place hope in and look at there in capital letters taking advice to yield belief in to listen to to Aspire to the favor of all those Greek definitions for the word obey submit would you like to look at it it means give way to to to yield to someone's authority to give way to submit to be submissive to surrender and the word watch because he watches for the welfare of your soul let me tell you what it means it means to lose sleep it means if you've got a leader if you've got a pastor who's willing to lose sleep over your problem I'm sorry I don't have your attention if you've got a I'm just saying if you do if you don't pray for one you need one but if you happen to have somebody who's watching for your life and who's willing to give up uh sleep and and multiple other things to be vigilant in awareness of threatening Peril if somebody's willing to put out a prayer call that says we're in a Warfare season and we need to be on guard then we all ought to carry the burden we all ought to realize what a blessing and a privilege it is to have somebody who's helping us get there amen we're just preaching in general terms Now 1 Timothy chap 5 verse 17 through 22 let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor especially they who labor in the word and Doctrine let's go on for the scripture saith Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn and the laborer is worthy of his reward sometimes people start making quick calculations in the church and they think well I guess that person makes at least 50,000 so that's how much is that for the pastor you know and if that family there they probably make 60 5 70,000 a year well well how much is that for the pastor you start adding that all up and the next thing you know you've got this mentality that your leaders are getting rich while you suffer if you let the devil talk to you that way he'll talk you out of paying your tithe and when you quit paying your tithe you're cursed with a curse it is what the word says just remember this is just a little side note we're teaching and preaching this morning in general terms I'm not preaching about myself unless I'm guilty if I'm guilty then I'm talking also about myself but just remember as a side note a personal note is my agreement with this body is much much fairer than what brother Brandon proposed I receive a half 50% of your tithe that means if you put in $10 in the offer offering as tithe I I receive $5 minus tax now that's what you need to calculate you know some people are Mighty proud when they write out that check for $70 they're Mighty proud of that and they don't realize when the enemy starts telling them the preacher had on new shoes I don't by the way nothing I have on is new this jacket is is about 17 years old and I can finally get in it again so I decided to wear it today the shoes are a little newer than that but but not new don't let the devil talk to you that way and and just remember I don't pay social security I don't pay Medicare somebody said what in the world does that mean I know we're getting personal and I said I was preaching in general terms in here I being very per who else is going to tell you this nobody absolutely nobody is going to tell you this I don't pay social security or Medicare so guess what that means I don't get any when it comes time to receive Social Security there won't be any for me when it comes time to get Medicare there won't be any for me because I don't pay it and have never paid it it was an option that they gave us many years ago I took the option uh somewhat foolishly because now I'm on my own you get it and uh thank God I'm feeling good physically but you know you get old you need a little help sometime I'm putting my trust in the Lord I am I have to it's where I have to put my trust I don't have a retirement plan here my retirement plan is out of this world I have health insurance but I got a feeling when I get get too old to fulfill my duties you'll take that too because you'll have to give it to your new pastor so just remember the devil is a liar he will torment your mind he will cause you to Envy he will cause you to have jealousy and it will rob you of your Victory it'll also Grieve Your Watchmen don't muzzle the ox that tread out the corn if someone had a right attitude toward leadership they would be so thrilled and so happy if they thought their Pastor was being blessed I'm being honest we need to take a little lesson from the African-American church the one thing they've got right is they know how to take care of their pastors they don't resent the new automobile cuz they know that it's used for the kingdom I'm just preaching in general terms remember against an elder receed not an accusation but before two or three Witnesses them that sin rebuke before all now now how many times have you ever had your feelings hurt because you were called on the carpet your your situation was mentioned while that preacher just gets up there and preaches about me all the time well I don't think those things ought to be handled over the pull pit that's well I don't think those things ought to ever be said publicly I think that ought to be dealt with I think the pastor ought to always go to that person as an individual and work that out I just want you to know that's not what the Bible said the Bible told you as PE as Believers that's how you're supposed to handle your problems with one another you're supposed to go to one another and sort things out when you offend your brother when you know your sister's got an offense against you you're supposed to go to her and work that thing out but a pastor is not given the same instruction an elder is told them that sin rebuke before all that others also May fear fear it's not easy if a man is a leader and he Delights in that he's sick right there's not one part of me that thinks that's fun I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that thou observe these things without preferring one before another doing nothing by partiality people get this idea in their mind I'm I'm not being you know looked at or looked after or called as much or visited as much as some one else you know you get your eyes off of that I know who you're not looking [Music] at you're not looking at the word I don't know how many times I hear that little thing going around I know somebody's talking about me you're right somebody is it's just almost always right what are you going to do about it that's the question I'm going to get my mind on Jesus I'm going to keep on keeping on I'm going to do what granny said and I'm going to say well they got a good subject if they're talking about me they're leaving somebody else alone I'm not going to come to church bitter I'm not going to try to get everybody to feel sorry for me come on that's not what this is about if you are struggling with these kind of authority issues or you recognize them in your family there can be a remedy you can lay the a to the root of the tree and you can say I'm going to deal with addiction and I'm going to deal with this but I'm also going to deal with a spirit that wants my family to resent Authority I'm going to set a better example you know sometimes when people are looking at leadership this the old Kingsman song he didn't even shake my hand I don't know how many times through the years for years I stood out front every service I was younger then I felt better I don't know how many times people walk by walked by in those days never saying hello never saying God bless you never saying that was a good sermon you know why cuz they were mad they didn't like what was being preached come on and you know what I would find out later they would be telling somebody he didn't even shake my hand after that sermon and I thought to myself you walk right past me if you'd have got in lying I would have been happy to shake your hand but you're the one that's got the ought oh my I know no one's happy I can tell I can tell you're not but if you if you can remember the last time I preached a sermon like this this I'll stop now I didn't think so lay hands suddenly on no man neither be partaker of other men's sins keep thyself pure let's read that in the Amplified let the elders who perform the duties of their office well be considered double worthy of honor and of adequate financial support especially those who labor Faithfully in preaching and teaching for the scripture says you shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the Grain and again the laborer is worthy of his hire Deuteronomy 25 let's go back Deuteronomy 254 Luke 10:7 does anybody know what that means it means if you've put an ox to a job you don't starve the ox while he's trampling out the corn remember they're stomping on the corn you don't muzzle him so that he has nothing to eat you make sure that he's taken care of because he's laboring on your behalf right that'd be like a woman not wanting to make dinner for her husband ever and yet he goes all day and if if she's at home particularly and he goes all day and works hard and brings the money home to Prov provide for the needs and the bills of the home and and and the wife so you know whatever so carried away with Instagram or whatever the case might be that she would never want to prepare a meal for her husband I'm telling you that just wouldn't be right this wouldn't be right be at peace so it's a key listen to No accusation presented before a judge against an elder unless it is confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses as for those who are guilty and persist in sin rebuke and admonish them in the presence of all so that the rest may be warned and stand in wholesome awe and fear I'll skip some of those scriptures are too tough for the crowd this morning questions and answers when all else fails let's put it off on brother brandham questions and answers law having a shadow he said we believe in church government and the government is ordered of the holy spirit in the Bible the pastor is always the head of the church the pastor is always that's God's Elder in organizations you have to come through the bishop he's telling you that's not our way he said now the Bible there's no higher order in the Bible than the Elder of the church just tell me tell me where it's at he said there's no higher order in the Bible for the church than the Elder which is the pastor he's the highest order of the Bible Hebrews chapter 7 number two paragraph 282 but the full and complete authority of the church read that in the Bible see if that's not Bible order that's exactly right there's no other no one above the Elder I have nothing to do with what brother Neville does here that's up to you and brother Neville I I don't think I have that quote this morning but brother brandham says something that I find to be quite interesting at one point he said the only thing I have to do with this church is I own the property he said brother Neville is your pastor you're dealing with him if there's a problem with him you let me know but he said I'm not involved in the every daytoday uh you know activities of the body you let brother Neville do what brother Neville's supposed to do and then look at Christ is the mystery of God revealed and stay with your pastor see he's the shepherd and you give him respects he'll lead you through and C cause he's ordained of God to do so of course we know that's if he stays on the word in Jeremiah 3:15 woo praise the Lord and I will give you pastors from today uh from today's sheet charity I will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding look at what the Amplified said and I will give you spiritual Shepherds after my own heart in the final time who will feed you with knowledge and understanding in judgment are you there the message says in God doesn't call into judgment without warning him first paragraph 104 but you see in the church that's also from today I think there is a pastor and that Pastor is a special person he's built to where he can put up with fusses of the people see see how it works it works both ways I can't tell you how a pastor ought to be treated if I'm not willing to carry a burden on cuz evidently I'm an ox and it's my job he said he's built to where he can put up with the fusses of the people he's AAR burden Bearer he's the ox of the team God help him I don't even know who he is but I know he needs help right he's a man that can sit down somebody's got something against somebody else and sit down with them two families and Tak neither side and reason it out and bring it right back into sweetness he's a pastor he knows how to take care of things my wish we had one I truly truly do because he's a special built man in the message Revelation book of symbols he said your pastor when he stands here on the platform ministering the word of God he is God's angel to the church Messenger to the church therefore a pastor should never leave that word but stay straight with the word because he's feeding it's the shepherd's place you believe that cuz the word pastor means Shepherd look it up find out if that ain't right a pastor is a shepherd and the Holy Ghost has made him overseer over a certain flock to feed them with what the word of God Amen oh my in the message I am the resurrection and the life let's just get it all over as fast as we can paragraph 49 now now then you got to have confidence he said this is the house of judgment you know I think even the bride has somehow Through The Years picked up a denominational mindset of what a church is we we're not here to organize golf tournaments we're not here to have a softball league this is a house of judgment where God comes down listen where God comes comes down and passes his judgment your your pastor is supposed to be a righteous man the congregation supposed to be with him 100 100% you're supposed to be just 100% together and in there if you're not then Satan's got a way to get in right you got a loophole somewhere so have everything cleared out one more you got it in you Hebrews chapter 5 and and six number one paragraph 26 but I believe in the supreme authority of the local assembly Let each Church be its on choose its pastors deacons or whatever it is and then that way the man is there has no Bishop over him that's really something the Holy Spirit wants to speak something to that church they don't have to ask anybody about whether they could do this or do that see it's not a denomination it's the individual in contact with the Holy Spirit he said show me by the Bible what's greater in the Bible than a local Elder to a local church each Church in in itself he said that's right yes sir the sovereignty of the local church each Church in itself now Brotherhood that's wonderful all churches ought to be in a brotherhood like that together but the sovereignty of the local church that's why it's very disturbing in this hour when so many people are posting about our Prophet Joseph I find it most disturbing because if there was ever an anointed Man Who Rose on the scene for the past 30 Years Around the message if anybody put confidence in him they told all over the country he thinks he's an eighth messenger I mean anybody I can name names of men who raised up with gifts and godly and and really doing some wonderful work in the kingdom of God but they were just sure if anybody liked him that he was trying to be an eighth messenger and the same people mind you the same people are posting today we're following our Prophet Joseph who's the youngest son of brother brandham it's absolutely ridiculous to try to bring people in such a mentality that the only way we can believe the message is to come here sit here together and listen to brother Brandon on to tape every service that's the most ridiculous thing that I've ever heard of if that's what you're looking for you might as well just stay at home listen to a tape for yourself you didn't come here for that every service upon every service upon every service we are believing that if you see the value of this message you're taking time to hear it it's our responsibility to hear what has been spoken to this day but there's no scripture anywhere that tells us that a mechanical device has the anointing or the ability to perfect the body of Christ he said it's a five-fold ministry didn't say four-fold didn't say threefold so that must mean that there are apostles today it must mean that there are prophets today maybe I need to say little p because that makes people feel more comfort we're not Catholics we don't call Micah a minor prophet and Isaiah a major prophet if they were prophets they were prophets we're not following brother Brandon because he was a prophet we're following him as he followed Christ because the word that he preaches lines up with the book he was a messenger with a special calling and mandate to this generation to help return Hearts back to the word amen but he himself tells us that there's a fivefold Ministry and that means Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists and we need them for you to tell me that every word on tape is thus sayith the Lord is absolutely ridiculous it makes no sense to anybody except those who are deluded by that lie you can't preach something with a progressive revelation and then say that when you said it one way it was thus sayeth the Lord and then when you corrected it and said it another way that too was thus sayeth the Lord you're giving infallibility to a man and brother brandom said Christ is the infallible one Among Us your pastor me I'm not infallible oh Lord no I make mistakes all the time and I do my best to correct them and I've marched many times back to this pull pit and backtracked and said I missed that I was wrong I didn't say that right please forgive me I didn't handle that right please forgive me that's what we have to do that's what we have to do amen 1 Corinthians chap 4 verse 14-6 in the Amplified said I do not write this to shame you but to warn and counsel you as my beloved children and it's Paul again he said after all though you should have 10,000 teachers guides to direct you in Christ yet you do not have many fathers Paul said for I became your father in Christ Jesus Through the Glad Tidings of the Gospel so I urge and implore you this is Paul speaking to the church at Corinth I urge and implore you be imitators of me follow follow me as I follow Christ that's what the first church age messenger said how many of you believe if that's what the first church age messenger said then the last Church age messenger would have to say the same thing follow me as I follow Christ and any leader any Pastor any part of the five-fold ministry that's God ordained would want to want to say the very same thing when I'm wrong if I'm off the word let's talk about it let's straighten that out let's get that taken care of and go on let's don't get further and further away from the truth I notic some of my big amers are quiet this morning I don't understand that first Peter chap 5 verse 5 and 6 likewise ye young I'm just reading you the word I'm not only telling you what the pro I'm reading right out of the Bible likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the Elder right what I see happening as we get further and further along is each generation shows respect and honor less and less in in everything you know we were taught even in the message of the hour we were taught for instance if it's not our party in charge we respect the president I told you before I had very little respect for President Obama and people have tried to correct me even recently I'm I'm telling you you're wasting your time I'm thankful that he stood for Israel the rest of his the rest of his mannerisms and and what he was operating and trying to do in our nation we're still trying to recover from the effect of it today I saw in the spirit the demon standing behind him when he addressed this nation and yet when he walked in the room I was privileged to be in the room where he was and when he walked in the room I stood to my feet not because I was afraid of the Secret Service but but I actually felt honored to be in the room where the president of the United States had come in because we're told if you can't honor the man you honor the office that he holds is that right and and younger people what we see happening today is there's such disrespect you know I came from a generation where a child a teenager even a young married man would never call a senior person his SE his senior I don't mean a retirement age he would never have called a someone senior to him by his first name especially in the South you would add sometimes you would add Mister to his first name because you knew him too good to call him Mr Smith that wasn't that didn't seem polite enough but you didn't want to call him out of respect Bob so you'd say Mr Bob even with our children we did things like that people that who were particularly close to the family we called them all Uncle like Chad back there then we had to explain later in life we had to explain to them well whose brother is Chad is he Mama's brother or Daddy's brother well neither but we wanted to give him a little title of endearment because he was special to our family so we said Uncle you know you may have thought it was kind of funny here Tuesday night when sister called me Father Papa or whatever well I want you to know I get that every day I'm not exaggerating every day someone greets me from Africa or the Philippines or other countries of the world either as uncle or Papa because it's just it just in their culture shows that you are putting some respect on the office that somebody holds I don't want this generation of young people to fear their leaders but I want them to understand the importance of showing proper respect can I just give you a little help here when your leader your pastor walks into a room where you are it's your responsibility to be friend ly to show kindness to show respect it's just your place and when he speaks to you your brother gy let's put it all on him when he speaks to you you should answer him yes sir that's right no sir not because he's so old he is getting older but not because he's so old but because he has a an office Among Us you think I've lost my my marbles this morning it it bothers me and I wouldn't address him by his first name it doesn't show proper respect I don't like when I when I hear someone say concerning brother Brandon bill I don't even want to hear him say brother Bill I don't think that's proper respect if you get slack your children will be slacker your grandchildren will be slacker do you believe that's happened in the church would you believe that in most churches in this city today they call their Pastor Bob or Joe or they call one another by their first name instead of saying brother and sister like the Bible instructs us to do as brethren in the faith we need to learn and and and what I see is that thing gets bigger and bigger and bigger if you're in a group of people and your pastor your leader speaks to you you need to listen you need to stop what you're doing and listen now whether you do what he said or not is totally up to you but you need to show enough respect that you sto doing what you're doing you turn around and face the person that's addressing you and listen to what they have to say oh you're just really mad I have been mad before but this is not one of those times I just want you to understand that I believe that one of the ways those familiar spirits operate is not just addiction it's despising Authority younger submit yourselves unto the Elder yes all of you be subject one to another this first Peter be subject to one another and be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble I want you to know we're blessed to have Elders we're blessed to have older Saints who have paid the price who stood the test of time give them double honor if Jesse wants to walk sister Flo out the door or some other brother just do it it's not because she's not capable if somebody wants to say to some of these other sisters sister bever somebody let me carry your bag because sometimes she comes in here with several bags heavy weights of things you say hey let me carry that for you it's just the right thing to do and I want you to know something bigger than that God will bless you he'll B you bring you bring a cup of cold water in the in in in the lord's name let's say it that way God will bless you for that in the message Revelation 4 number three I'm going to skip a lot of scriptures here paragraph 161 he says so now see now let me go back a little further than that go back about the 21st verse while you're looking that is paragraph 161 of Revelation chapter 4 number three he said he's reading the scripture here submit yourselves one to another in the fear of God and then paragraph 16 to he said submit yourself congregation submit yourself to your pastor Pastor I'm going to wait and see if they can get this one because this is this is to bless you too this is 1961 January the 8 Revelation chapter 4 number three Jeff paragraph 161 and 162 submit yourself congregation submit yourself to your pastor Pastor I get preached to too Pastor submit yourself to your congregation now listen listen what that means if a little click Rises up one time brother Bren said if a little click or a little cult Rises up in the church if a little click Rises up don't be on either side just talk to the pastor submit yourself to the whole congregation congregation if you start in a click submit yourself to your pastor in the fear of God see oh brother we didn't seem to get that one up for you but I I understand I'm glad I bragged on them before now it's not easy it it works both ways it works both ways let me get off of this let's look at another way that Authority can be abused Matthew 22 oh they're shouting the aisles I mean some folks aren't even in here I don't know where they are Matthew chapter 22 verse 15- 22 then went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle if you thought it was quiet a minute ago just wait just wait just wait we're off the pastors now just wait then when the Pharisees uh uh then went the Pharisees and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk and they sent out unto him their disciples with the herodians saying Master we know that thou art true and teach us the way of God in truth neither carest thou for any man for thou regardest not the person of men woo they're slick tell us therefore what thinkest thou is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or not oh yes I'm going to enjoy this one the pressure is off of me but Jesus perceived their wickedness and said why tempt ye me ye Hypocrites show me the tribute money and they brought unto him a penny and he saith unto them who is this image and superscription they say unto him Caesars then saith he unto them I wish this was red letter it is red letter in the Bible I wish you saw it in red letter render therefore Jesus talking render there look see Caesar was wicked render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar and unto God the things that are Gods when they heard these words they marveled and left him and went their way in the Amplified verse 21 reads like this they said Caesars then he said to them pay therefore to Caesar the things that are due to Caesar and pay to God the things that are do to God Titus 3:1 put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers to obey magistrates to be ready to every good work now let let me show you what the prophet says about such paragraph 78 questions and answers number three he said I'm going to say this just looked at a person a few minutes ago uh it was asked me by a fine boy the other day we was hunting squirrels that morning I got five I left one of them for the a for that afternoon you only get six in the state of Kentucky that's the limit so this certain person said I got nine Oh no you're going to I'm going to slow you if you can't say nothing just groan just groan oh I got nine Christian boy fine kid and I said brother bandam said to the Fine kid who bragged about getting nine when the legal limit was six hear me he said you done wrong you did wrong he said well I said I had five that morning and save one for that afternoon and when I got that one squirrel looked in a tree and counted five or six sitting there where I could look at them walked out and left them because that's what a man of integrity would do because Caesar said that in Kentucky the limit is six he said I walked up here in a tree not long ago and there was about 15 or 20 sitting there I just took the limit and walked away and left the rest of them there I said if I come to this country and preach to you boys and you people hear the thing that's right I've got to live that example Christianity ain't what you say it's what you live it's what you do it's an example you're the salt of the earth uh brother Nathan prayed this morning he he said I I said then the law says the law says Jesus said you give Caesar the things that belong to Caesar you break that speed law out there said what are you doing you're doing wrong let me get me some water while you speed demon process what are you doing you're doing wrong you sin he said give Caesar what's Caesar's and God what's God's listen this is a man we're talking about a man who had so much Integrity not only in the natural things but the spiritual thing remember in the natural things he told his wife to lie for him to the IRS the The Infernal Revenue system and then had to go back and speak to the representative and apologize to him for lying wait a minute I'm not hearing enough amens come on that's Integrity he had so much Integrity even on spiritual things that he believed it was s to fish or hunt on Sunday he didn't say it once he said it multiple times he even says a Believer wouldn't do that he said I have swam out in the river in the cold River on a Saturday night to unate my Trot Line because I didn't want to be guilty of fishing on the Lord's day we can go to this whole thing Sunday's not the Lord's Day Saturday's the Lord's day all right then if that's how you feel don't be fishing and hunting and doing those things on a Saturday but what I find is Extreme Sabbath people they'll say well Sunday's not the Lord's day anyway and then they won't make Saturday the Lord's day every day is the Lord's day but the word tells us something's supposed to be set apart holy and and Sanctified unto the Lord isn't that right come on now I know it's not popular he said then you did what Jesus told you not to do he said and if you don't let's go back he said well the law is wrong this is what the what the man said to him the law is wrong how many of you have ever felt like the law was wrong I have how many of you have ever felt like that 30 5 on a highway for Lane is too slow I've even said to people in in in traveling with them I've even said to them look we don't know there's got to be some reason I don't like it I don't like it it's ridiculous it don't make any sense but there must be a reason well yeah the law is just trying to take all our rights away from us no there's a possibility that there a death trap there if I was making the law I would go out there and look up here I'm preaching to you if I was uh in charge of the law I'd go up there to the BP and I would put a 25 speed limit on that intersection on the four-lane highway and there'd be a lot less accidents and a lot less uh hospital visits and ambulance take because people don't know how to operate in that intersection and it would be worth somebody's while to slow down to pay attention to what they're doing rather than to be hauled out in an ambulance sometimes there's reasons we don't know you wouldn't think that would be such a crazy place but it is he said now yeah the law is wrong I can't help what wrong it is it's wrong to break Jesus commandment what commandment is he talking about he's telling us now let's see if you're hearing he said and if you don't give Caesar the things that Caesars then you did what Jesus told you not to do and the listen and the transgression of the law is sin that's right now brother brandham is is taking the law of the land and giving it equal place with the law of the word that's pretty serious comparison he said and this will make us all feel better we're all guilty we do it but we but here's the key when you see yourself wrong oh praise the Lord we're just growing by Leaps and Bounds in the spirit this morning aren't we he said but when you see yourself wrong stop it you may forget it but when you catch yourself again stop it and here's the reason he said people are watching you you know people know where you go to church are you looking this way that's proper respect people know where you go to church church or somebody to go and say I'm just going to break the law I'm just going to do I'm that's wrong you're reflecting not only on your family you're reflecting on your church you're reflecting on your savior he said when you see yourself wrong stop it people are watching you people won't go to church but they'll read you see what you do and I want the balance on that and I'm going to give it to you in the last one in the message once more 1963 brother bam gives us a good balance here he said but I know that if they have a law here A Fire Marshal's law just so many you have to leave so many aisles so much aisle and so forth and that they cannot help because that we are as Christians we've got to do that he said for the Bible said Jesus told us to give Caesar those things that pertain to Caesar and then to God those things that belongs to God so we try to and and listen listen and if we will not obey Caesar it's doubtful that we'd obey God let's get the balance let's here's the balance and as long as Caesar's laws doesn't interfere with Gods somebody said pastor didn't you open this church when we were under a lockdown I did because I found a place where Caesar's laws and God's laws didn't jha you see Caesar's law as long as Caesar's laws don't interfere with Gods we must obey God in what order first Our obligation is to the spirit law the spiritual law first and then the natural law he said we must obey God first and then these fire hazards and so forth well they know how to take care of that and they told us he's just talking about restrictions that are placed on Gatherings and so forth we're going to put God first I want you to put up the last oh it's can you all believe it's just 115 I got 45 more minutes isin't it amazing don't you you know sometimes people go out here and they say it didn't seem like two and a half hours I guarantee you you won't say that today you might say he preached 45 minutes less and it seemed like 4 hours longer that's what it means to be in the hot spot now look at there's a twin there's a twin behavior that runs along with authority issues let let me just make sure before we put this next definition up that you follow what I'm saying you've got to respect the structure of a [Music] family I know that step stuff and that half stuff can get hard to Wade through sometime it can I I know that sometimes it's hard to be fair and I know that everybody says well I'm going to love my stepchildren just like my children blood children and some people find that easier to do than others I believe everybody intends to do that I believe that good people set out to do that but it's not always possible because some kids are just broken and you don't heal them by breaking them further the only way to heal them is love them and help them and try not to show partiality between them and that's not easy to do it's easier for [Music] some than it is for others my grandmother and my grandfather did a good job they had two sons and a daughter and the two sons had more than one wife wife my dad two wives my uncle many and my grandmother and my grandfather determined in their mind to say to their sons I was there multiple times they said to their sons just because you're through with her my mother for instance Jane I heard my granddad and my grandmother say to my dad multiple times just because you're through with Jane just because you put her away you're done with her doesn't mean we are don't expect us to put her out because you put her out now ain't that something now we're not going to mistreat your wife 2 three four however many we're going to be as good to them as we possibly can just know that we may not be done with them by the time you are and we're going to include them we're going to treat them the same if we can't give a birthday present to all of them we're not giving to any of them you know my dad and my uncle they resented that because in their mind at that time in their life if she's not good for me she ought not to be good for you but sometimes we get mature enough to understand folks are broken we're healers come on we're not those who want to make things worse we want to make things better so you've got to respect the structure of a family you've got to learn to it's not easy but you've got to learn to do it you you made the decision and now you can't check out I hate some time in in my experience through the years as a pastor I've seen a poor woman put in the middle between her husband now and her children from the from a previous relationship that's a hard on a woman now just remember this is coming from someone who doesn't believe in double marriage remember I don't think you ought have done it in the first place but if you did you got to live with it don't let those Authority issues continue to disturb the peace love them into submission there is a way to heal what the past has broken yes pastor that's right that's right if you've been betrayed by your pastor give your present pastor at least a chance if you've been mistreated by a a boss on a job just try your best to give your present boss a an opportunity to prove that he might want to do a little bit better in line don't let that authority issue or that man hating issue or that woman hating issue be something that travels with the spirit through your Generations in closing there is a behavior that manifest in the same way when a familiar spirit is present and this runs right along with authority issue it's Rebellion let's let's look at the uh the definition of that let's go out with a bang Rebellion opposition and defiance toward rules and our overseers see how it runs carry a sense of mistreatment and that life is unfair this often comes from comparing their life with someone else's and this manifests with stubbornness and resistance to change this sometimes manifests as chronic divisiveness always causing a division it's rooted in Rebellion I was doing a little study yesterday on the difference between envy and jealousy did you know that jealousy can be a positive thing right the Bible said so God is a jealous God the definition of jealousy is when you are feeling threatened and you protect what is yours so God said I'm a jealous God he's going to protect what's his all jealousy is not good because some people become so paranoid that somebody is out to get their husband are you kidding I know it does happen but the reality is you barely want him why would you think everybody else is after him some people will let jealousy control their life you don't want that Envy is different Envy is never mentioned one positive time in the Bible most of the time we call Behavior jealousy and it's never it's hardly ever jealous it's almost always envious to Envy means to as the definition say to compare what you've got with somebody else's and wished you had it nothing wrong with wishing that something that you could have a certain thing that's not wrong as long as you keep it in its proper place but that thing will destroy people's minds comparing you know I've had even most recently someone mentioned to me uh in their in their own stress and in their their own trial they've said well don't you know that I'd like to have a vacation well sure who wouldn't like to have a vacation but sometimes it's just not affordable it's just not possible sometimes if you watch after somebody else's and you let that make you [Music] bitter you lose you get this place of entitlement and you you start comparing your day trip I'm going to preach this real hard cuz I'm fixing to go away for a couple weeks I'm going to make this I'm just kidding I mean I'm not kidding I am a sometime later in the month but that's not what this little spurt is about if you get your eyes on somebody else's their car even their CH their family their children I wish my children would have turned out like that I I wished I could have that kind of a vacation you we should welcome our new yepy neighbors I I guess everybody knows by now that a real prayer has been answered for me I desired from the beginning when they started cut those trees out up there that somebody in this body would be able to occupy that house particularly that one because of how close it is to the tree line and as of yesterday brother Austin and sister Anna and their family moved in we've got yepy neighbors thank God for doing that for them you ride by and you see how nice it is don't you let don't you let you learn to celebrate somebody else's success thank God you made a way Lord and it's not wrong to say if you made a way for somebody else you can make a way for me that's not wrong but it would be wrong to say for instance I might say why that houses double the value of where I live and have lived for 30-some years but you know what I don't let that cross my mind right now I'm where I want to be that's why when my family send sends me advertisements of houses for sale I just say well that's a nice house oh that's really ni isn't that nice that's wonderful but right now I'm where I want to be I'm not going to let Envy get in my heart and affect the church body don't you either don't you let it happen don't you let it happen you celebrate you celebrate somebody else you thank God don't let something get in your heart like this and we're we're going to close Rebellion I want to show that before we leave it runs with those authority issue opposition and Defiance toward rules Andor overseers carry a sense of mistreatment oh I know people like this I know people like this do you know anybody like this I know people like like this they carry a sense of mistreatment and that life is unfair this often comes from comparing their life with someone else's and this manifests with stubbornness and resistance to change as we read a moment chronic divisiveness or divisiveness some people say you don't want that in your life and let me show you why here's the scripture 1st Samuel chapter 15 and verse 23 for Rebellion that's Defiance to to to rules to Authority or even to change Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness ohoh that's not steadfastness we're steadfast on the word yes but we're stubborn when we demand our ways there's a difference when we stand on the Integrity of the word we can be steadfast when it's our way or no way nobody wants to follow that Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness as is as iniquity and idolatry see there it runs the word of the Lord said because thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord Samuel to Saul he hath also rejected thee from being King he wouldn't do what God Said do he made an excuse for not doing what God Said do come on and it cost him his influence and position because when when when he decided to do it his own way he just thought he had a better idea but in his heart it was Rebellion against the word of the Lord and God said it's the same as if you were practicing with a witch it's it's like worshiping an idol when you're so stubborn oh oh Hallelujah don't worry I'll buy my own lunch we don't want that I don't think anybody in the body of Christ wants to be under that kind of rebellion you know and and what often happens when you're under it is you may be 56 but you act like you're six and that's pretty confusing to six-year-olds or 16y olds we've got to believe that the Lord is going to help us we want to speak as positive as we can about dignitaries Bible tells us to leaders whether they are natural leaders or spiritual leaders and like I've told you before sometimes you have to look extra hard to buy the Mother's Day card or the Father's Day card sometime you have to do like I did for years you buy a blank one and write in it what you can think to say because you can't just go in there and generically just pick one off that says you've been there for me my whole life when you hadn't heard from them in 25 years see but God didn't say honor them if they're worthy of honor he said if you honor your parents you're going to have a long life if you don't honor you're going to pay a prize so it works in the natural and in the spiritual and if we don't get a hold of something like that eating in this generation it'll get worse in the next one and the next one if Jesus terries and the next one let's stand musicians are coming sorry I have 238 text most of them full of love if I was ashamed of what I was saying this morning I wouldn't have said it to the whole world but I know it's awkward I have felt the awkwardness but who would who would do it I want you to know this let me tell you this when I was an evangelist when I went from church to church I made sure sure that I honored the house it's the right thing to do I heard brother brandham do it I I did it before I ever heard brother brandham but I heard brother brandham do it he would honor those men on the platform some of them teaching false Doctrine a third or a half of them trinitarian he might have just said demons travel in the titles but he' turn turn around and look at everyone now you outstanding men of God and Men of Integrity and when I was an evangelist and I went to a church to preach I probably could see more wrong in that church than anybody else as a visitor but I made sure to build up the pastor so that he didn't have to build up himself do you understand what I mean I'd often preach on showing the pastor love and showing the pastor respect because there are just certain things that are hard for a pastor to say if that wasn't necessary this morning I wouldn't have brought it but it is necessary it's part of the balance and I don't know about all preachers but I don't want anybody so afraid they can't greet me that's not what I want and and I want to have a a at least a somewhat of an approachable spirit I could have brought some other quotations brother brandom said you know some people are looking for a friend he said that's impossible he said a spiritual leader just couldn't possibly be a friend to everybody he said just not possible and said but that's not what God raised him up for he he also said if I spent time with people all the time he said then I wouldn't have the word of the Lord for you when it came time and I want you to know that whether we recognize it or not that's the most valuable thing when brother gy or your pastor comes and we bring you what the Lord has given that is what we need in this hour Lord let it always be true let it be on the word Let It Be Right let it be without compromise let it be without prejudice let it just be what we need even if it's not what we want because we don't want our children to struggle the way we have struggled that's right or our grandchildren struggle the way if we go from P to brother to first name basis what do you think the next step will be hey you haven't you seen it in the word haven't you seen it in the world here in the South it it it's gone from yes ma'am to yes to yeah on now and now it's worse why are you screaming at me that's the Rebellion I got I want you to know that if if I would have said to my mother what I hear I would have had a broke jaw I'm not exaggerating I would have had a broke jaw you may not like me but I'm your mother she would have said and you're not going to talk to me that way if we don't get ah hold of these things that's when they become generational and they just keep on going we ought to find a better way isn't that the truth let's Worship the Lord do do you have any energy left do you have any heart left I don't even have a song to go with that Benjamin so I hope you do we could sing you know there's a preacher in the church oh my Lord and He won't do right oh my Lord so what do we do kick him out kick him out and let the church roll on we could do that one we love you Jesus above all Po and above all Kings above all nature and all created things above all wisdom and all the ways of [Music] men you were here before the world begin wonder Jesus above all kingom and above all Thrones above all wonders this world has ever known above all and Treasures of the earth there's no way to measure what you're worth you were [Music] crucified laid behind the sto you live to die rejected and lo like a rose trampled on the ground you took the fall yes you did and you thought of me [Music] above all and you were crui laid behind the stone and you lifted die rejected and alone like Roose Tred on the ground Lord you took the fall you of me and you thought of me Above All Above All poers and above all Kings above all nature and all created things above all wisdom and all the ways of oh you were here before the world be above all kingom and above all Thrones above all wonders this world has ever known and above all wealth and Treasures of the earth oh there's no way to measure what your word and you were crucified laid beh the stone yes you will live to die reected and alone like a rose that was trampled on the around Lord you took the fall and you thought of me above all and you were crfi laid behind the stone yes you live to die rejected and alone like that was trampled on the ground Lord you took the and you thought of me above all and you were [Music] crucified laid behind the stone you live to die reject did andone like rose trampled on the ground you took the and you thought of me above all you were [Music] crucified laid behind the stone you Live to Die rejected and alone like a rose that was trampled on the ground Lord you took the and you thought of me above all family line we carry some sense of disrespect to authority authority issues if it's because of men if it's because of family if it's because of church abuse doesn't matter what the cost today Lord we we don't want it that's we just don't want it it not only affects our spiritual life but it'll go with our it'll go with us to our job and it'll affect our family it'll affect our children and so Lord we just bring to you our hurts and our betrayals and our wounds and all the times that we've been let down by those who were commissioned to protect us and keep us like mbth of old we've been dropped we've had had some heartbreak and we are thankful that you have given us Grace to keep pressing on but if somehow we have built up a resentment toward any Authority especially Spiritual Authority Lord we we come before you today and we ask that you would forgive us and heal us once again we ask that you would cut us off from the past I believe your blood is sufficient to sever the tithes of from yesterday I believe that your blood can break any yoke that we carry from past experience past hurt or past abuse we don't want to be careless with our trust we don't want our confidence to be solely in man we want our confidence to be in you but we also recognize the balance of the scripture when you tell us not to just cast our confidence away because we've been failed if if if a husband and a wife were to do such a thing as that there would never be healing in a marriage if they held a grudge if they weren't willing to let it go so Lord we just submit every part of who we are to you right now and we confess that with your strength it is our desire to let go our past hurts and our betrayals and those times that we have been dropped or let down because we don't want that thing running like iniquity through our families oh Jesus we want our children and our grandchildren to learn the ways of respect and honor we want the house of the Lord to be a place where a culture of honor is upheld we can see the humanity of a prophet we can can see the humanity of a pastor a teacher or an evangelist without disregarding the call that you've placed on their lives I pray that you'll help us we can look over the flaw of a boss man and even a president if you'll give us the grace to do it we reach for something higher in you and we recognize that there are things that affect us that keep keep us from climbing this mountain and we want to go higher and we need to be released from some of this heavy baggage if you are here and you sense that you're uh carrying around a load that's pretty heavy from from yesterday from the past that that affect the way that you deal sometime with authority if you can see that I'm not trying to find you but maybe You' just slip up your hand and agree with this prayer right now Lord I want to be healed I want to be whole I don't want to hold someone in my life now accountable for something that someone else did I don't want to be prejudiced toward somebody that you bring into my life now because someone else let me down or abused me or failed me I I I want to let the past be the past I'm thankful that these things didn't come to stay they came to pass Lord see every hand right now and and the and and the Heart see that right now and pour oil I think the only way to break it to move forward is to see healing take place You Are the Healer oh yes your bomb is healing and it it restores s and it ministers and and the reality is Lord there have been times that a Shepherd had to break a leg I noticed it brother Brandon when he's telling that he always said and the shepherd strayed and we know that he didn't mean that the shepherd went out of the way it in in the in the things that are right but he was telling us that the shepherd was willing to leave the the pack and go after that one and after several times of having to go get somebody the shepherd realized the only way was to break the leg and it would heal but perhaps not in the same way and the Sheep would never forget it but never stray again Lord if that has ever been a case in my life and I hold resentment instead of Honor I want you to heal me now I want you to show me that place I want you to pour oil on that place that wound and I want to be able to believe that you have my best interest as someone said I think it might have been Nathan again in his prayer all these things for my good all these things for my good Lord help us to remember that life doesn't just live it live itself you're Sovereign and we surrender to your sovereignty in Grace Hallelujah maybe you would just put your hand on somebody you you don't have to single someone but just whoever you're near we're just praying for one another that we that we rise above whatever it is that holds us and impedes Us in
