[39:51] would you remember again brother
[39:54] Greeley's sister Phyllis in the loss of
[39:57] her husband Tony that God will minister
[40:01] to her and help her and the entire
[40:04] Greeley family and remember those Nathan

[40:11] and charity and uh Luke and Megan and
[40:15] Shiloh will be coming in this evening
[40:17] let's pray for safety for them for the
[40:20] Greeley is anticipating starting the
[40:22] drive home from Pennsylvania tomorrow
[40:24] unless something should come up there in
[40:26] the family so we want to hold him up to
[40:28] the Lord in prayer
[40:30] we want you to remember little Eli
[40:33] sister Rebecca's nephew
[40:35] belonging to Austin and Hannah he has
[40:39] been had some problems with the with the
[40:42] Billy Rubin numbers and was under the
[40:44] light but has had a great response and
[40:46] was allowed to go home even though they
[40:48] told him yesterday morning they were
[40:50] going to keep him for an extra day they
[40:52] decided to send him home so they're
[40:54] praising the Lord for that also sister
[40:57] Rebecca's sister Lily could use our
[40:59] prayers the Lord has placed something in
[41:02] her heart and the enemy is doing
[41:03] everything he can to oppose and to
[41:06] distract her but we know that the devil
[41:08] is defeated
[41:09] sister Sandy Mann requires our prayers
[41:12] this morning she is fighting something
[41:14] in her body and is going for uh to the
[41:17] clinic this afternoon to see if they can
[41:19] do something for her but we know that
[41:21] the Lord can certainly beat him to it he
[41:24] knows how and then one of our faithful
[41:26] streamers a friend from my childhood
[41:28] sister Dora is asking prayer an unspoken
[41:33] request and also sickness in her home
[41:36] we need prayer our family needs prayer
[41:39] we're I'm sensing this morning that
[41:42] we're under an attack of Benjamin uh
[41:45] nearly passed out in the bathroom back
[41:48] here this morning before service went
[41:50] pale as a ghost and I've been sick this
[41:54] week my wife was battling and you know
[41:56] sickness comes but I just discern and
[41:59] sense deeply this morning that it's more
[42:01] than that and we know that the Lord is
[42:04] more than able and I'm sure if we're
[42:06] under attack then I'm sure that there
[42:08] are others in the church that are facing
[42:10] the same kind of adversity but we know
[42:13] who the victory is Lord Jesus Christ has
[42:17] already won the victory for us

[45:57] from you experiencing you
[46:05] there's nothing in this life that can
[46:07] fulfill the longing in our hearts but
[46:11] you
[46:14] but father we have
[46:17] a job to do
[46:19] while we're on this Earth We're not
[46:21] satisfied with this Earth
[46:23] we're only satisfied
[46:26] with you

[46:30] it pleases you

[46:46] Jesus
[46:47] and we lift the needs that seem
[46:51] unbearable on our own
[46:54] but because of who you are
[46:59] the vanished
[47:01] before the authority of the king
[47:06] so we pray Lord for those that are needy
[47:09] in their bodies
[47:12] it is the pleasure of our father to heal
[47:16] his children

[48:51] is to cry before you and now hearing
[48:54] that there's something going on in the

[49:06] to the will of God to deal with the
[49:09] attacks of the enemy and I ask you oh

[1:04:55] let's thank the Lord for these musicians
[1:04:59] [Applause]
[1:05:04] he's just good
[1:05:07] he is good he is good
[1:05:10] he is good
[1:05:12] he is good
[1:05:15] all the time
[1:05:18] all the time
[1:05:21] he is good
[1:05:23] well I want you to turn in your Bible
[1:05:27] this morning if you will this morning
[1:05:32] to Genesis chapter 1.
[1:05:36] I don't know if any of you
[1:05:38] were able to catch any of the memorial
[1:05:42] service yesterday
[1:05:44] for brother Tony Pinto but
[1:05:47] brother Greeley was the
[1:05:49] leader of the service and uh he spoke in
[1:05:53] between
[1:05:55] and he sung
[1:05:57] and he just created
[1:05:59] a one-man created an atmosphere
[1:06:03] for that memorial service and I was so
[1:06:08] thankful
[1:06:09] and and and so proud
[1:06:12] just really grateful for his life
[1:06:15] and for his ability to lead in a
[1:06:18] difficult time like that and we will
[1:06:21] continue to to pray for them and the
[1:06:25] singing wasn't draggy it was it was the
[1:06:27] kind of singing that we ought to sing
[1:06:29] when we're singing a saint home
[1:06:32] amen and I appreciate it brother Hawk's
[1:06:36] prayer it was not just a prayer it was a
[1:06:39] bearing witness of testimony
[1:06:42] and that is encouraging
[1:06:44] it encourages us to keep pressing the
[1:06:48] battle there's a battle and it's raging
[1:06:51] but Jesus Is the Victor
[1:06:54] he's already won this thing
[1:06:57] we just have to stay abiding in the vine
[1:07:01] he is where our life comes from we're
[1:07:04] going to read in Genesis 1 verse 2 and
[1:07:08] 3.
[1:07:09] and before we do we just want to say
[1:07:13] thank you for your prayers there have
[1:07:15] been a lot of text there have been a lot
[1:07:18] of messages some phone calls checking on
[1:07:21] me after Tuesday night the Lord really
[1:07:24] came I can't tell you how he came to
[1:07:27] help me Tuesday night
[1:07:28] he helped me so much I don't say that
[1:07:31] the preaching was good but it was helped
[1:07:34] by the Lord I'll tell you that because I
[1:07:36] didn't have the strength to do it but he
[1:07:38] came and my blood pressure when we went
[1:07:42] I went for a infusion an IV infusion on
[1:07:47] Tuesday and that combats dehydration and
[1:07:51] it's also liquid vitamins and when I am
[1:07:54] suffering with my with my foot some
[1:07:57] extra vitamin C is good it's amazing
[1:08:01] actually and you can only take so much
[1:08:04] by mouth without having other problems
[1:08:06] as you all know and so one of the ways
[1:08:09] to get more C in your body is to take it
[1:08:12] directly in an IV and so I did that and
[1:08:15] before they gave me the IV my blood
[1:08:17] pressure was uh well I wouldn't even
[1:08:20] tell my wife how high it was Triple
[1:08:22] digits top and bottom and I came here
[1:08:25] just worn out from that but God came and
[1:08:30] he helped me took all week but yesterday
[1:08:32] my bottom number which is the most
[1:08:35] important number it dropped to below
[1:08:37] triple digits so I'm thankful for that
[1:08:40] and I know that God is moving and I know
[1:08:43] that that sometimes there is a little
[1:08:46] witchcraft involved we want to be on
[1:08:49] guard we don't want to be paranoid or
[1:08:51] panicked but we want to be on guard
[1:08:54] because the enemy as I've told you
[1:08:56] thousands of times he's not going to lay
[1:08:59] down and play dead while you become like
[1:09:02] Jesus Christ sometimes we become so
[1:09:05] absorbed with our own problems that we
[1:09:07] forget other people around us have
[1:09:09] problems sometimes we we are the victim
[1:09:12] of I know you're standing sometimes we
[1:09:15] become the victim of Friendly Fire
[1:09:19] did you know that did you know that your
[1:09:22] friends can be praying against you and
[1:09:25] not even fully realize what they're
[1:09:27] doing
[1:09:28] prayer is not to influence God
[1:09:33] prayer is to express your faith and his
[1:09:36] ability to discern and know what needs
[1:09:39] to be done
[1:09:40] that's what prayer is
[1:09:42] and therefore When you pray you should
[1:09:44] not
[1:09:45] tell him what to do
[1:09:48] you know God doesn't need somebody
[1:09:50] directing him he needs somebody to trust
[1:09:53] him
[1:09:54] and so I just discerned even this
[1:09:57] morning that some of my battle was
[1:09:59] friendly fire
[1:10:00] so if you see your pastor in need would
[1:10:04] you pray that God's perfect will be done
[1:10:08] in my life and the life of my family and
[1:10:11] would you refrain from telling God what
[1:10:13] to do with me
[1:10:17] because he knows better than you do
[1:10:19] he knows better than you do and if you
[1:10:21] see a need in my family would you ask
[1:10:24] God to to work his will out for them
[1:10:27] instead of being creative intercessors
[1:10:31] can get way out of whack sometime with a
[1:10:34] good heart
[1:10:35] oh telling God do this and speak that
[1:10:39] and and shake that and loose that and
[1:10:42] bind that
[1:10:45] what we need to do is believe that it
[1:10:48] will be done on Earth
[1:10:52] just pray that
[1:10:54] I'm just going to pray for Elias here
[1:10:57] and I'm going to say on Earth
[1:10:59] as it is in heaven
[1:11:01] for my brother
[1:11:04] I just prayed a more powerful prayer
[1:11:06] than you would spend 30 minutes telling
[1:11:08] God what to do with Elias
[1:11:12] he knows just Lord don't let Elias get
[1:11:15] in the way don't let anybody else get in
[1:11:17] the way of your will being done on Earth
[1:11:21] even as it is done in heaven
[1:11:25] that's prayer Jesus wasn't just giving
[1:11:28] us a suggestion when he gave us the
[1:11:30] model prayer he was giving us an outline
[1:11:33] for prayer so please
[1:11:36] please
[1:11:38] I know you love me but would you please
[1:11:40] quit telling God what to do with me and
[1:11:42] my family and would you please ask the
[1:11:44] Lord that his perfect will be done on
[1:11:47] Earth in our lives even as it is done in
[1:11:49] heaven that's the prayer I pray over you
[1:11:51] daily and I would appreciate the same
[1:11:54] people just don't know they get excited
[1:11:57] and they want to move and shake and
[1:12:00] change and shift
[1:12:01] and sometimes God is doing all of that
[1:12:05] and we get in his way
[1:12:07] I know I'm in the word
[1:12:10] I know what I'm saying this morning is
[1:12:12] in the words I've walked in too many
[1:12:14] camps to doubt what I'm telling you
[1:12:16] right now to be the truth I know this is
[1:12:18] the right way so we should pray that for
[1:12:21] one another we're not trying to cut down
[1:12:24] our prayer time we're trying to be more
[1:12:25] effective when we pray
[1:12:27] how many of you want to pray effectively
[1:12:29] and then you want to spend more time
[1:12:32] praising God and thanking God for his
[1:12:34] faithfulness than you do telling God
[1:12:36] what to do
[1:12:38] when he sown himself into you by the
[1:12:40] Holy Ghost and by the seed of his word
[1:12:43] he did that so you would learn to come
[1:12:45] into agreement
[1:12:47] Earth must come into agreement with
[1:12:51] heaven
[1:12:53] and I've sensed that sometimes people
[1:12:55] take this place for granted and it
[1:12:58] doesn't take newcomers sometimes too
[1:13:01] very long to do the same
[1:13:03] so let us not do that
[1:13:05] let's not take this place for granted
[1:13:08] we don't try to hold you here we don't
[1:13:10] try to bind you here when you go off you
[1:13:13] can visit other places
[1:13:17] and I am confident that you'll not find
[1:13:20] another place like this place
[1:13:24] I didn't say not something better
[1:13:27] maybe you'll find it better but you if
[1:13:28] this isn't the place
[1:13:31] I don't know where it is
[1:13:34] because I know what God's doing here
[1:13:36] get behind it
[1:13:38] and that's how you
[1:13:41] from other churches
[1:13:45] that you feel
[1:13:46] Genesis 1. I'm already getting stirred
[1:13:49] up here and stirring emotions up I saw
[1:13:53] people getting stirred already
[1:13:56] well I've never heard of telling people
[1:13:58] how to pray well I got to I have to it's
[1:14:00] it's about to kill me
[1:14:05] I gotta help you Genesis 1 2 and 3 and
[1:14:09] the Earth was without form and
[1:14:14] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:14:17] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[1:14:21] upon the face of the waters
[1:14:26] and God said
[1:14:30] and God said
[1:14:34] and God said
[1:14:38] he hadn't been doing any talking
[1:14:43] but now God
[1:14:46] say it
[1:14:48] let there be light
[1:14:52] and there was light
[1:14:54] I want you to remember Moses wasn't
[1:14:57] there
[1:14:58] he's writing this through a scribe by
[1:15:01] divine inspiration of what God revealed
[1:15:05] to him when he put him in the cleft of
[1:15:08] The Rock
[1:15:09] and he allowed his hinder parts to pass
[1:15:13] by Moses
[1:15:14] meaning it was a revelation of where God
[1:15:17] had been and what God had already thus
[1:15:21] accomplished and when Moses saw that in
[1:15:25] the glory of God he knew it as though he
[1:15:29] were there
[1:15:30] Moses being a prophet was given that day
[1:15:34] access to the mind of God
[1:15:37] wouldn't that be amazing
[1:15:39] and in that Mind Of God he saw this
[1:15:42] event and was able to write it as though
[1:15:47] he was standing there do you know that's
[1:15:49] a revelation
[1:15:50] may God add his Blessing to the reading
[1:15:53] of his word you may be seated
[1:15:59] there there must be a repositioning
[1:16:03] in a time and season of change
[1:16:07] I'm telling you right now some of you
[1:16:09] are going to have to turn loose of some
[1:16:12] things
[1:16:14] and it's going to cost you
[1:16:18] you know that Prophet you were hoping to
[1:16:21] make
[1:16:25] that bonus you were hoping to draw
[1:16:28] we're going to find out in this hour
[1:16:31] that we can't hold on to things
[1:16:33] when the seasons are changing and God is
[1:16:36] saying I'm calling you away from that
[1:16:40] you're going to have to leave that
[1:16:41] behind
[1:16:42] you may not be able to wait until the
[1:16:45] market shifts
[1:16:47] you may not be able to wait till the
[1:16:49] interest rate drops
[1:16:51] you may have to find yourself taking a
[1:16:53] loss
[1:16:54] because when the spiritual season
[1:16:57] changes we've got to make sure that we
[1:17:01] are clinging to the right thing and
[1:17:04] turning loose of the wrong thing and
[1:17:07] remember what may be wrong to hold on to
[1:17:10] in this season could have been right
[1:17:13] to hold on to in the last season doesn't
[1:17:16] mean it was evil doesn't mean that God
[1:17:18] didn't give it to you that mean that God
[1:17:20] didn't call you to it
[1:17:22] what it means is he's through with that
[1:17:26] in your life but I didn't see what it
[1:17:29] accomplished you may never until
[1:17:31] eternity
[1:17:32] you may not know why God had you in that
[1:17:35] or why he had you holding on to that
[1:17:38] until you move into eternity then you
[1:17:41] may look back and say oh wow here I
[1:17:44] didn't think I learned anything here I
[1:17:46] didn't think I gained anything here I
[1:17:49] didn't think I got ahead and now looking
[1:17:52] From eternity's perspective
[1:17:55] are you going to help me
[1:17:57] looking From eternity's perspective I
[1:18:00] see that God was using that
[1:18:04] it might be a relationship it might be a
[1:18:06] job it might be it might be a business
[1:18:11] it could be a lot of things
[1:18:14] it could be stinking thinking
[1:18:16] it could be an idea a concept of God
[1:18:20] that you have held on to something that
[1:18:23] you were believing
[1:18:25] with all of your mind
[1:18:29] and yet God comes along and says it's
[1:18:32] time for you to run that through the
[1:18:36] filter of the absolute
[1:18:39] because we're not following extra
[1:18:42] biblical books
[1:18:44] we're following the word
[1:18:46] I want you to know for your for your
[1:18:48] pastor
[1:18:50] I believe that God sent a prophet
[1:18:53] but when I look for an absolute I'm not
[1:18:56] looking to a spoken word book because
[1:18:59] man has had his hand in that I'm looking
[1:19:03] to the word and when I say that I don't
[1:19:06] just mean the Bible
[1:19:08] because man has had his hand in that
[1:19:12] holy men inspired of God wrote these
[1:19:14] things but it's been translated and and
[1:19:18] paraphrased at times to get down to
[1:19:20] where we are we're talking about the
[1:19:22] witness of the Living Word Jesus Christ
[1:19:25] Among Us John saw him on the Isle of
[1:19:29] Patmos standing in the midst of the
[1:19:32] seven golden candlesticks
[1:19:34] which were not seven individual
[1:19:37] candlesticks but it was the Holy Menorah
[1:19:40] it was the representation of the church
[1:19:44] ages and Jesus was in the middle of them
[1:19:47] all he was God in Ephesus
[1:19:51] he's God in laodicea he's God in the age
[1:19:55] of the Bride that is Dawning and
[1:19:58] Awakening upon us
[1:20:00] said my
[1:20:02] my job my commission my purpose
[1:20:05] is to forerun
[1:20:10] the coming
[1:20:14] you know what the rest of it is
[1:20:16] the coming word
[1:20:20] he wasn't building a platform for a
[1:20:23] person
[1:20:24] he was making a way for the word to come
[1:20:28] and in its fullness
[1:20:31] reproduce the life
[1:20:34] of Jesus Christ
[1:20:37] there's so much deity in you right now
[1:20:41] that you can't comprehend
[1:20:44] how it how big it is
[1:20:46] it only takes one drop of him
[1:20:50] did you know it we know God's not an
[1:20:53] ocean
[1:20:54] but brother random talks to us about the
[1:20:56] ocean
[1:20:57] he talks to us about Lake one of the
[1:20:59] Lakes
[1:21:00] he talks about the fact that you take
[1:21:02] one drop out and you've got the whole
[1:21:05] You've Got a representation of the whole
[1:21:07] thing
[1:21:09] you break that down chemically and
[1:21:12] everything that's in that ocean is
[1:21:13] represented in that one drop I hope
[1:21:15] you're hearing me so if you've got one
[1:21:19] drop of an eternal God living inside of
[1:21:23] you you have the representation of
[1:21:27] everything he is
[1:21:31] and let me just spoil this
[1:21:34] let me just go ahead and spit out where
[1:21:38] I want to go in a minute there's one
[1:21:40] thing that I want to emphasize to you
[1:21:43] this morning and that is he is a creator
[1:21:47] God is a creator
[1:21:50] Titan was a created being Lucifer
[1:21:55] well I had to dig up a clip now I hope I
[1:21:58] don't well I better not tell you that
[1:22:01] let me see if I should tell that or not
[1:22:04] no I don't think I will
[1:22:10] be right with you
[1:22:15] Satan is not a creator
[1:22:18] he was created
[1:22:20] are you in me
[1:22:22] he's a perverter brother Branham said he
[1:22:25] perverts what's already been created but
[1:22:28] God is a creator
[1:22:30] creates
[1:22:32] he creates how does he create anybody
[1:22:34] know how he creates
[1:22:36] by speaking
[1:22:40] do you know how you are to create
[1:22:44] by speaking
[1:22:47] do you know you're already doing it now
[1:22:52] do you know we're creating Darkness
[1:22:55] when we speak Darkness
[1:22:58] do you know we're creating chaos
[1:23:01] when we speak chaos
[1:23:04] do you know we're creating confusion
[1:23:07] when we speak confusion that's why the
[1:23:10] bride has got to check up she's got to
[1:23:13] check herself in this hour
[1:23:16] because this is an hour to give
[1:23:20] ourselves to the word like we've never
[1:23:23] given ourselves to the word before
[1:23:25] whatever you do Church don't find
[1:23:27] yourself
[1:23:28] disrespecting the word
[1:23:31] in this hour honor the word
[1:23:34] do everything you can to honor the word
[1:23:38] of God do everything you can to honor
[1:23:41] the word of God the word of God is
[1:23:44] creative
[1:23:46] come on and it's alive
[1:23:48] remember when we say the word of God
[1:23:51] we're not just talking about the printed
[1:23:53] page we're talking about the actuality
[1:23:56] of the word
[1:23:57] the living person of Jesus Christ he
[1:24:01] doesn't just live in the prophet he
[1:24:03] doesn't just live in a five-fold prophet
[1:24:05] or a five-fold apostle or a five-fold
[1:24:09] pastor a five-fold teacher five-fold
[1:24:11] evangelist
[1:24:13] he doesn't just live in a deacon or a
[1:24:15] trustee or a minister
[1:24:18] he doesn't just live in a musician or a
[1:24:20] worship leader he lives in his bride
[1:24:25] he lives in his people and so he's in
[1:24:28] you this morning
[1:24:30] by the seed word of God and by the
[1:24:33] infusion and baptism of his life
[1:24:37] you've been infused with the life of
[1:24:39] Jesus Christ you've been baptized with
[1:24:43] the spirit and to have just one drop of
[1:24:48] God in you
[1:24:49] is to have the potential
[1:24:52] of all that God is
[1:24:57] you ought to shout
[1:25:00] he's here
[1:25:02] you know what well
[1:25:04] you know why you're looking in the wrong
[1:25:06] mirror
[1:25:08] you're supposed to be looking at the
[1:25:10] mirror of his word and when you look in
[1:25:13] the mirror of his word guess who you see
[1:25:16] you see the word looking back
[1:25:21] the Bible tells us through the first
[1:25:23] church age messenger that we are
[1:25:25] transformed
[1:25:27] by looking at him
[1:25:29] if you want to be a different man than
[1:25:31] you are today look to Jesus I'm up here
[1:25:34] I'm up here hello
[1:25:36] if you want to be transformed to a
[1:25:39] different woman look Upon Jesus
[1:25:42] for for if you look upon him you'll live
[1:25:45] we're not trying to build a memorial to
[1:25:48] the Brass serpent
[1:25:49] we're not trying to put Brother
[1:25:51] branham's picture up so that everybody
[1:25:53] can sit here on a Sunday morning and see
[1:25:56] brother Branham pictured there
[1:25:58] when I first come around the message
[1:26:00] people they put the picture of the
[1:26:02] pillar of fire now
[1:26:05] it's Hoffman's head
[1:26:08] some Churches you'll see the pillar of
[1:26:10] fire a lot of them now it it it's uh
[1:26:13] excuse me it's brother branham's
[1:26:15] portrait
[1:26:17] and Hoffman's head over here
[1:26:20] of Christ
[1:26:22] so you're looking up and you're seeing
[1:26:24] brother Branham and you're seeing Christ
[1:26:27] the whole time that you're here to
[1:26:28] worship
[1:26:29] well I want you to know I didn't come
[1:26:31] here this morning I don't want to make
[1:26:34] you mad
[1:26:35] but I didn't come here this morning to
[1:26:37] look to a prophet I came to look to the
[1:26:40] one that he came to introduce me to the
[1:26:43] Lord Jesus Christ we can honor Jesus by
[1:26:47] honoring brother Branham I understand
[1:26:49] that but we didn't come here to get a
[1:26:51] good look at him we came here to get a
[1:26:54] good look of Jesus Christ if we don't
[1:26:57] keep that in Balance we'll be guilty of
[1:26:59] what the children of Israel were guilty
[1:27:01] of keeping the brass Serpent and
[1:27:04] beginning to worship Him and look to it
[1:27:07] as though it possessed power in itself
[1:27:09] brother Adam said I am nothing
[1:27:12] just a sinner Say by Grace I am your
[1:27:16] brother I'm just a vessel I'm just a
[1:27:20] vessel a servant that he can use so are
[1:27:24] you
[1:27:25] so are you and in order for you to
[1:27:29] understand who you are you've got to
[1:27:31] look straight to the word and honor the
[1:27:34] word and the word is the very person of
[1:27:37] Jesus Christ and we need him in our
[1:27:40] midst because there's a creative work
[1:27:42] that has to be done on planet Earth
[1:27:44] before the bride goes out of here hear
[1:27:46] me
[1:27:48] there's a creative work
[1:27:50] that has to take place so where are the
[1:27:53] creators
[1:27:55] if there is a creative work then where
[1:27:58] are the creators
[1:28:00] here we are
[1:28:03] does that sound like blasphemy to you no
[1:28:06] it sounds like what sets the truth apart
[1:28:08] from the church
[1:28:12] so
[1:28:13] there is a repositioning
[1:28:17] that has to take place
[1:28:19] when we recognize that God is squeezing
[1:28:23] us
[1:28:24] you know I like to stroll from season to
[1:28:27] season
[1:28:38] Josh yeah Alano back there recently saw
[1:28:42] me in a parking lot
[1:28:44] and he said I know that's my pastor
[1:28:47] because I recognize his walk
[1:28:51] nobody walks like that well I like to
[1:28:55] kind of stroll from spiritual season I
[1:28:59] like to walk out of my trials
[1:29:03] but I right into my blessings
[1:29:06] but how many of you know you don't
[1:29:08] always change dimensions and seasons
[1:29:11] threatened
[1:29:16] sometimes it's by contractions
[1:29:29] you know I saw once envisioned Mount
[1:29:32] Zion
[1:29:33] in birth pains
[1:29:36] she was Contracting like a woman giving
[1:29:39] birth because it is out of
[1:29:44] because it is out of Zion that sons are
[1:29:48] born
[1:29:49] the sons of God are birthed out of Zion
[1:29:53] so Zion is more than a place
[1:29:58] Zion is a people
[1:30:00] and Zion people they come about by a
[1:30:04] Zion birth
[1:30:06] and sometimes the squeeze is how we get
[1:30:10] from one season to the next and there's
[1:30:13] nothing dignified
[1:30:16] it's messy
[1:30:19] it's full of fluid it's full of blood
[1:30:22] it's full of water it's full of
[1:30:24] a lot of stuff
[1:30:27] when the baby comes
[1:30:29] and then there's That Hideous yet
[1:30:31] miraculous
[1:30:33] placenta
[1:30:38] hairy creature
[1:30:40] that sustains the life of a of a baby
[1:30:44] that thing has to come birth is ugly
[1:30:47] and birth is a mess and you're not going
[1:30:51] to always stroll from one spiritual
[1:30:53] season to the next sometimes
[1:30:57] you're going to be squeezed out
[1:31:00] and sometimes you're going to walk into
[1:31:02] your new season with a cone-shaped head
[1:31:07] because
[1:31:08] cause things get a little tight in there
[1:31:12] how many of you have ever had a season
[1:31:14] where you it was getting a little tied
[1:31:17] in here
[1:31:22] somebody said 2020 was like that
[1:31:25] and then 2021 came and they said 2021
[1:31:28] that was it that was the year from you
[1:31:30] nowhere
[1:31:32] and then 2022 came and they're saying
[1:31:35] the same thing and the truth is none of
[1:31:38] them were hideous or horrible or from
[1:31:41] hell they were all from heaven
[1:31:44] they just did not smell the same they
[1:31:47] don't all look the same because in God
[1:31:49] their Ebbs and flows in seasons and
[1:31:52] cycles and come on
[1:31:56] all of this for a purpose because there
[1:31:58] are virtues
[1:32:02] that's more than Thunders by the way
[1:32:06] virtues
[1:32:08] that we are climbing
[1:32:10] and the and the word of the Lord came
[1:32:12] and said you're gonna get it by births
[1:32:14] you're going to get them by births
[1:32:16] you're not going to get them by them
[1:32:19] dropping down on your head you're going
[1:32:21] to get them by being birthed from one
[1:32:24] virtue into another virtue into another
[1:32:27] virtue as you begin to climb the stature
[1:32:31] up into climb up into the stature of the
[1:32:34] perfect man
[1:32:36] it's the perfect man it's his stature
[1:32:40] that we're climbing into and the perfect
[1:32:43] man was John 1 in the beginning was the
[1:32:45] word the word became flesh and the Word
[1:32:48] was God
[1:32:49] come on are you with me
[1:32:51] we got a long way to go
[1:32:54] so we better move on can I share with
[1:32:57] you Genesis 1 through 3 in the Young's
[1:33:01] literal translation of the Bible let's
[1:33:04] look at it Young's translation of the
[1:33:06] Bible in the beginning
[1:33:09] of God's
[1:33:11] preparing the heavens and the Earth
[1:33:15] the Earth hath existed
[1:33:18] waste and void and darkness is on the
[1:33:23] face of the deep
[1:33:26] and the spirit of God fluttering
[1:33:33] just like brother Branham taught us
[1:33:37] the Holy Spirit dove
[1:33:40] cooing and making love
[1:33:43] over the water
[1:33:46] now we Now understand that it wasn't the
[1:33:49] water water spirit it wasn't the water
[1:33:52] that the Holy Spirit was fluttering over
[1:33:55] particularly it was what was beneath the
[1:33:58] water
[1:33:58] and that was the seed of the previous
[1:34:01] existence
[1:34:03] the seed of everything that God created
[1:34:05] in the original creation because we know
[1:34:09] that when the Earth was without void
[1:34:11] without form and void it was not in its
[1:34:14] original condition because there's
[1:34:16] nothing in the character and nature of
[1:34:19] God that creates things as waste
[1:34:24] God is Not wasteful
[1:34:27] he's a god of purpose
[1:34:29] the Earth hath existed waste and void
[1:34:32] and darkness is on the face of the deep
[1:34:34] and the spirit of God fluttering
[1:34:38] on the face of the waters and God's
[1:34:41] saith let light be
[1:34:48] and you finish it for me
[1:35:01] he was calling light to separate itself
[1:35:06] from the permeating darkness and chaos
[1:35:11] of a civilization that had failed
[1:35:15] but all as a part
[1:35:19] of a living God
[1:35:22] a rebellion had already taken place
[1:35:25] and ambition had already took a hold of
[1:35:29] a created being who was no longer
[1:35:32] satisfied to live and serve in his
[1:35:35] estate and Ministry and so he said that
[1:35:38] we read in Isaiah I will ascend
[1:35:42] I will exalt myself above the Throne of
[1:35:46] the most high God I will I will I will I
[1:35:49] will I will
[1:35:51] and that plunged the Earth
[1:35:53] and I know you know this and I'm going
[1:35:55] to share it again in just a moment I
[1:35:58] know you know this but I'm getting to
[1:36:00] something I hope you can stay with me
[1:36:01] for a little while and let's ride
[1:36:04] together
[1:36:06] now I want to read verse 2 and 3. from
[1:36:10] the translation of the book of
[1:36:14] Genesis
[1:36:17] by our late friend
[1:36:20] Rabbi David Friedman
[1:36:24] of blessed memory
[1:36:26] he translated the entire book of Genesis
[1:36:31] in Hebrew the book is called bearishit
[1:36:35] and this comes from his translation of
[1:36:38] the Book of Genesis and title bearish
[1:36:40] sheet and this is barashit chapter 1
[1:36:43] verse 2 and 3.
[1:36:45] Earth
[1:36:47] was chaotic
[1:36:49] and without order
[1:36:51] and darkness blanketed Earth's surface
[1:36:57] now Dr Friedman's translation is as
[1:37:00] close
[1:37:01] to the original Hebrew as you can come
[1:37:04] but it reads a lot like Young's literal
[1:37:09] translation
[1:37:11] meaning there are not a lot of added
[1:37:13] words in our King James version of the
[1:37:16] Bible there are thousands tens of
[1:37:19] thousands of words
[1:37:21] that do not appear in the original text
[1:37:25] they were placed there by King James
[1:37:27] translators
[1:37:29] to make it easier to read
[1:37:32] I'm not saying that we lose inspiration
[1:37:37] but I am saying that sometimes a meaning
[1:37:41] becomes more vague
[1:37:44] by adding extra words to it
[1:37:47] just simple articles
[1:37:50] can take you in a different direction of
[1:37:54] understanding so I like to go back
[1:37:57] to some of these more literal
[1:38:00] translations when I study scriptures of
[1:38:03] this importance
[1:38:04] Earth was chaotic
[1:38:07] and without order
[1:38:09] and darkness blanketed Earth's surface
[1:38:12] God's spirit hovered
[1:38:16] over the waters
[1:38:18] then God declared
[1:38:21] let light exist
[1:38:27] and Light
[1:38:29] came into
[1:38:31] being
[1:38:33] it could also be translated light
[1:38:37] stepped forth
[1:38:39] it's powerful yes
[1:38:41] because
[1:38:43] the original Hebrew seems to indicate
[1:38:47] and we read in the humash
[1:38:50] and some of you have a homage in your
[1:38:54] home
[1:38:55] and if you do if you will read some of
[1:38:58] the
[1:38:59] rabbinical writings
[1:39:01] and commentary from the humash
[1:39:05] you will read that it is believed from
[1:39:08] the original text that this Darkness was
[1:39:11] a unique Darkness
[1:39:14] it was not a darkness that speaks of the
[1:39:17] total absence of light
[1:39:20] but that it was rather a permeating
[1:39:23] Darkness
[1:39:25] because the darkness had stepped forward
[1:39:29] and the light had retreated
[1:39:33] so what we really have is a mixture
[1:39:37] but with predominant Darkness
[1:39:40] and God said come here light
[1:39:45] I want you to understand how that
[1:39:47] everything in creation must respond
[1:39:51] anybody sit with me
[1:39:53] everything in creation must respond to
[1:39:57] its Creator's voice
[1:40:01] nothing has the choice
[1:40:04] of saying not today
[1:40:09] should he speak today to the son
[1:40:13] shine no more
[1:40:15] the sun would not have within itself the
[1:40:20] ability to reason with its creator
[1:40:26] somebody said what would the son say it
[1:40:28] would say nothing
[1:40:31] somebody said wouldn't the son say Amen
[1:40:33] no
[1:40:35] the son wouldn't say Amen if the Creator
[1:40:38] Stay With Me
[1:40:39] if you're a student especially Stay With
[1:40:42] Me
[1:40:43] if the Creator were to say to the son
[1:40:45] today son shine no more put
[1:40:50] woof
[1:40:52] that's it
[1:40:54] no reasoning
[1:40:56] no amen
[1:40:58] no argument
[1:41:00] this the Earth plunged into total
[1:41:02] darkness which by the way would be
[1:41:04] catastrophic you understand it would
[1:41:06] only take a few seconds for you to
[1:41:08] freeze to death and all that we know is
[1:41:10] creation
[1:41:11] in the absence of the light of the Sun I
[1:41:14] might take a look I'm not I'm not trying
[1:41:15] to say that as a scientific expert but I
[1:41:17] know as you know that without the warmth
[1:41:19] and light of the Sun the Earth could not
[1:41:21] exist as it exists today
[1:41:24] so I love this concept
[1:41:26] of it being light was there because God
[1:41:30] was there
[1:41:31] but he allowed the darkness by judgment
[1:41:35] to permeate
[1:41:37] to to be the the dominating factor and
[1:41:41] the light just sort of stepped back out
[1:41:43] of the way and darkness stepped forward
[1:41:45] and one day God just looked down he said
[1:41:48] it's time to get this thing moving again
[1:41:49] and all he had to do was say light come
[1:41:52] here
[1:41:53] oh that's powerful folks I want you to
[1:41:56] know who you serve did I tell you that
[1:41:59] that a portion of that God that I tell
[1:42:02] you that a representation of that God
[1:42:05] lives inside of you right here today he
[1:42:11] lives right inside of your life as a
[1:42:13] Believer the very God who spoke it all
[1:42:16] into existence
[1:42:18] and then after judging the Earth because
[1:42:20] of Lucifer's Rebellion ambition and
[1:42:24] subsequent fall
[1:42:26] then he said I'm going to recreate I'm
[1:42:28] going to put this thing back in motion
[1:42:31] and all he has to do is step forward and
[1:42:33] say to them
[1:42:35] you just spoke come here light
[1:42:38] oh Hallelujah and light came into being
[1:42:42] the only thing we read of in the Earth
[1:42:45] at this point is water
[1:42:48] in the chaos and void
[1:42:52] existed only two great forces
[1:42:55] Darkness
[1:42:57] and spirit
[1:43:01] because remember spirit and Light
[1:43:06] are of the same essence
[1:43:09] Jesus didn't say where I go there is
[1:43:12] light
[1:43:14] did he
[1:43:16] he said I am the light
[1:43:19] understand so where Jesus represents
[1:43:22] himself in spirit
[1:43:25] light is there
[1:43:28] light is there
[1:43:30] so there were only two
[1:43:37] but there were two forces mentioned in
[1:43:40] these first three verses of Genesis one
[1:43:43] was darkness and one was spirit I want
[1:43:45] to tell you that's where we are again
[1:43:49] brother random tells us there's only two
[1:43:51] forces in the Earth right now and that's
[1:43:52] good and evil light and darkness
[1:43:55] come on
[1:43:57] Abel and Cain Seth and Cain Jacob and
[1:44:01] Esau Christ and Antichrist just two
[1:44:04] forces one of which is Darkness one of
[1:44:08] which is Spirit light and spirit life
[1:44:12] the darkness was a mixture of both
[1:44:15] darkness and hidden light in Isaiah 45
[1:44:18] and 7. I hope you can stay with me I got
[1:44:21] something to say
[1:44:22] Isaiah 45 and 7 he said I formed the
[1:44:25] light
[1:44:28] and look what else
[1:44:34] two forces
[1:44:36] one is darkness and one is light one is
[1:44:38] Darkness one is Spirit
[1:44:40] and God made them both
[1:44:42] you believe that
[1:44:44] do you understand that God made them
[1:44:46] both why there's no other Creator
[1:44:48] Satan's not a Creator angels are not
[1:44:51] creators I know you're sleepy but can
[1:44:54] you stay with me
[1:44:56] I formed the light I and create Darkness
[1:44:59] I make peace
[1:45:02] and here is the Clincher
[1:45:05] and what else do I do
[1:45:08] create evil
[1:45:10] Satan is not a creator
[1:45:12] somebody say that with me Satan is not a
[1:45:14] creator
[1:45:16] he can't create evil
[1:45:18] he didn't have to it was already created
[1:45:21] God created light
[1:45:23] and he created Darkness he created peace
[1:45:27] and he created evil he created the
[1:45:30] tempter
[1:45:33] he knew when he made this created being
[1:45:36] so beautiful he knew what was what was
[1:45:38] going to be missing
[1:45:40] just like when he created Eve when he
[1:45:42] took Eve out of Adam
[1:45:44] he knew that by bringing her out of the
[1:45:46] original creation and standing her on
[1:45:48] her own he knew the predisposition would
[1:45:51] be there to fall
[1:45:54] he saw that it doesn't make her less
[1:45:56] than a man it doesn't make her some poor
[1:45:59] poor decrepit creature
[1:46:02] she was just as much here let me let me
[1:46:05] let me share this with you and some of
[1:46:07] you will find a quote to I'm sure you
[1:46:11] will find a quote
[1:46:12] to dispute me
[1:46:16] but I want to tell you this Eve was just
[1:46:18] as much a part of the original creation
[1:46:20] as Adam was
[1:46:23] wait a minute brother Shelley brother
[1:46:24] bran said he was not a part of the
[1:46:26] original creation but I'm telling you
[1:46:27] the Bible tells us that she was
[1:46:31] when brother Branham goes on to explain
[1:46:33] what he does About Eve you will
[1:46:35] understand where he was coming from and
[1:46:37] what he meant he calls her a byproduct
[1:46:39] because she was taken from Adam
[1:46:42] but where was she when Adam was made
[1:46:47] come on where were you when Christ was
[1:46:50] born
[1:46:52] there you go
[1:46:54] she was in Adam in the original creation
[1:46:57] as soon as she was separated from her
[1:47:01] original state and from the original
[1:47:03] creation she therefore had these
[1:47:06] dispositions and these weaknesses that
[1:47:10] she did not have as long as she was
[1:47:11] plugged in
[1:47:14] to the original creation
[1:47:17] same way with you and I as soon as we
[1:47:19] were separated from Christ at Calvary
[1:47:22] we were already destined to come to the
[1:47:25] Earth through the church ages with a
[1:47:27] weakened nature
[1:47:29] but God had already made a provision I'm
[1:47:32] going to place a seed in them and that
[1:47:34] seed is light in life and that seed is
[1:47:37] word and that seed is going to attract
[1:47:39] the light and the word
[1:47:42] if you don't believe that you tell me
[1:47:44] what happened at the to the woman at the
[1:47:45] well
[1:47:46] that seed of God that was in her drew
[1:47:50] the light
[1:47:51] it drowned drew the light it attracted
[1:47:54] the light Jesus said I must needs go
[1:47:58] through Samaria her need became his need
[1:48:02] her knee Drew him and he had to need
[1:48:06] something I need to go because there's a
[1:48:09] need there that needs me
[1:48:12] right so she became the answer he became
[1:48:16] the answer to everything that she was
[1:48:18] drawing so the seed that was in her
[1:48:19] already drew the light
[1:48:21] same way with you
[1:48:23] because you chose Christ in eternity
[1:48:27] you came here with a representation of
[1:48:29] who he is
[1:48:31] and that seed is what drew the light of
[1:48:33] this truth to your life
[1:48:36] anybody with me
[1:48:37] that's why you are where you are today
[1:48:39] because there was something on the
[1:48:41] inside of you pulling that light toward
[1:48:43] you
[1:48:43] oh
[1:48:46] somebody said it took him a long time to
[1:48:48] get there oh no he was there before you
[1:48:50] knew he was there
[1:48:51] he was there before you recognized he
[1:48:54] was there he was watching over you even
[1:48:56] in sin
[1:48:58] Hallelujah
[1:49:00] like I say sometime in the crack house
[1:49:02] on the abortion table wherever you might
[1:49:05] have been he was watching over you
[1:49:09] because he knew one day that that cry
[1:49:12] that seeds cry in you would be louder
[1:49:17] it would be louder than all the other
[1:49:20] cravings and desires and that you would
[1:49:23] pull Christ toward you you would attract
[1:49:26] the word toward you
[1:49:28] and the word came by your way
[1:49:31] no wonder brother Linda wrote not even
[1:49:33] in my wildest dreams did I think I'd
[1:49:36] ever see such things
[1:49:38] as the coming of the Lord and the
[1:49:40] Rapture mystery how are we able to see
[1:49:43] it the light within us through the light
[1:49:45] to us
[1:49:46] [Music]
[1:49:51] Christ
[1:49:52] he didn't say I bring the light he said
[1:49:54] I am the light I am the light of the
[1:49:57] world anybody with me good that's page
[1:50:01] one
[1:50:02] was really page 20 but it's page one
[1:50:04] from today I formed the light and create
[1:50:06] Darkness I make peace and create evil I
[1:50:09] the Lord do all these things
[1:50:11] heaven was fine
[1:50:13] in Genesis 1 but something had happened
[1:50:16] to the earth a correction was needed
[1:50:19] that word was and the Earth was could
[1:50:23] easily be translated from the original
[1:50:25] became
[1:50:27] and so we could actually read
[1:50:30] and the Earth became void without form
[1:50:34] and void in Hebrew it's
[1:50:36] The Who
[1:50:39] it means in fact it's only used that way
[1:50:42] as a phrase in two other places of the
[1:50:44] Bible we don't have time to read them
[1:50:46] now but you might jot them down Isaiah
[1:50:48] 34 11.
[1:50:51] and in a moment I'll read Jeremiah 4 23
[1:50:54] two places
[1:50:56] in both cases this phrase points to a
[1:51:00] condition brought by God's judgment
[1:51:03] therefore it is argued that to be
[1:51:05] consistent we must conclude that the
[1:51:09] Earth became without form and void
[1:51:12] and here in Genesis 1 2 because of some
[1:51:15] Judgment of God
[1:51:17] the only
[1:51:19] prehistoric judgment revealed by
[1:51:22] scripture is that of Satan when he
[1:51:26] failed
[1:51:27] so any time you are reading about this
[1:51:32] kind I don't know what's happening now
[1:51:43] foreign
[1:51:46] what are you coming for
[1:51:49] isn't he good
[1:51:51] should we just go home now it's
[1:51:53] ten till one we could call it a day
[1:52:13] sweat two even sister Anna
[1:52:16] she'd break a sweat
[1:52:21] that might do it let me let me not take
[1:52:24] that unless I have to
[1:52:25] Hallelujah
[1:52:27] so only two places and the only judgment
[1:52:31] that we can see as prehistoric meaning
[1:52:35] before Genesis 1 1 is in the description
[1:52:39] of what happened in Isaiah when Satan
[1:52:43] Lucifer made his great uh
[1:52:47] promotion it was self-promotion wasn't
[1:52:51] it so the Hebrew word here for without
[1:52:53] form really means waste and hear the
[1:52:57] earth I want you to try to see this here
[1:52:59] the Earth is hanging in space unshaped
[1:53:05] it was once shaped and by the way that's
[1:53:08] round
[1:53:11] in case you're hearing something else
[1:53:21] unshaped unformed
[1:53:24] undeveloped and unfinished
[1:53:28] and it's just hanging there
[1:53:30] and that's so against the nature of who
[1:53:32] God is
[1:53:34] hard to imagine even
[1:53:36] but here is God's spirit
[1:53:38] hanging over the Earth
[1:53:41] just getting ready to work with the
[1:53:43] Earth again and how was it that young
[1:53:45] put it
[1:53:47] and the spirit of God fluttering on the
[1:53:50] face of the waters can you close your
[1:53:52] eyes and see it I can
[1:53:55] that sweet Dove of the holy spirit so in
[1:53:59] Genesis between verse 1 and 2 there must
[1:54:01] be a gap
[1:54:03] of Untold
[1:54:05] amount of time
[1:54:07] we know this because we read in about a
[1:54:11] similar period perhaps the same period
[1:54:13] in Jeremiah 4 let's go there quickly I
[1:54:16] sure didn't want to go into this but for
[1:54:19] someone's sake I feel I must
[1:54:22] verse 23 I beheld the Earth and lo it
[1:54:26] was without form and void and the
[1:54:29] heavens and they had no light
[1:54:31] I beheld the mountains and lo they
[1:54:34] trembled and all the hills moved lightly
[1:54:36] I beheld in low there was no man and all
[1:54:39] the birds of the heavens were fled I
[1:54:41] beheld and loathed the fruitful place
[1:54:43] was a Wilderness and all the cities
[1:54:45] thereof were broken down at the presence
[1:54:47] of the Lord and by his Fierce anger
[1:54:50] brother Branham referring to these times
[1:54:52] talks about a previous civilization
[1:54:57] so Bible commentators will take Jeremiah
[1:55:00] 4 and try to apply it to the flood the
[1:55:04] problem is with the flood The Fountains
[1:55:06] of the deep did break forth and burst
[1:55:09] open changing the environment and the
[1:55:13] surface of the Earth forever but we have
[1:55:16] no reason to believe that it caused the
[1:55:19] Earth to become unformed
[1:55:23] a waste yes but we don't have any reason
[1:55:28] to believe that the Earth lost its shape
[1:55:31] or its form because of the flood
[1:55:35] so this is most likely referring back to
[1:55:38] the same judgment God told Jeremiah that
[1:55:41] at the time the Earth was void and
[1:55:43] without form the condition was such that
[1:55:46] the mountains tremble Birds fled into
[1:55:48] the heavens the fruitful had been turned
[1:55:51] into a Wilderness and cities had been
[1:55:55] broken down
[1:55:57] and that fits right along with the quote
[1:55:59] that we have given many times from the
[1:56:02] message
[1:56:03] and it was
[1:56:09] it was and after this we read that God
[1:56:12] begins speaking forth I hope you can get
[1:56:15] with me
[1:56:16] his creative spoken word into the Earth
[1:56:21] so it appears that Not only was the
[1:56:23] spirit brooding over and guarding the
[1:56:26] seed
[1:56:27] because that was the spoken word
[1:56:30] the seed that lay beneath the surface of
[1:56:33] the water from God's original creation
[1:56:35] but also hovering there in Divine
[1:56:39] anticipation for the creative work
[1:56:43] that was about to come forth again did
[1:56:46] you follow that
[1:56:47] God's spirit was in Readiness to take
[1:56:50] the drowned planet and commence a
[1:56:53] recreation that would lead to the
[1:56:55] expression of a man that would be made
[1:56:57] in the complete and perfect image of the
[1:57:01] Creator himself
[1:57:04] so we know that regardless of what form
[1:57:07] man might have had before this
[1:57:12] he was not a creature made in the image
[1:57:17] and the likeness of God
[1:57:21] perhaps more neanderthal
[1:57:25] but he was not a man made in the image
[1:57:28] of God when God made Adam he made the
[1:57:31] first man that was made in his likeness
[1:57:33] and in His image
[1:57:35] but we believe that underneath the
[1:57:37] surface of that water there were spoken
[1:57:39] words of God that had come to the Earth
[1:57:42] in seed form and in the baptism of the
[1:57:45] Earth because of Lucifer's Rebellion
[1:57:47] though seed lay beneath the surface of
[1:57:50] the water the holy spirit is there
[1:57:52] making love over the word protecting and
[1:57:54] guarding the seed and hovering in
[1:57:57] anticipation of the recreation that's
[1:58:00] about to begin to take place on the
[1:58:01] earth knowing the spirit knowing that a
[1:58:05] man was about to be born
[1:58:07] a man was about to be formed
[1:58:10] in the very image and in the very
[1:58:12] likeness of God himself so beneath those
[1:58:15] wings of the spirit would a work be
[1:58:18] accomplished anybody hearing that
[1:58:21] where did the work come from
[1:58:23] beneath the wings
[1:58:25] of the spirit remember remember Exodus
[1:58:28] remember remember the cherubim
[1:58:31] remember the The Mercy Seat remember the
[1:58:34] voice of God saying I will meet you
[1:58:36] there between the wings of the cherubim
[1:58:38] I will meet you there this was this was
[1:58:41] another type of what God had already
[1:58:44] done and what he would later do in even
[1:58:46] in the hour that we're living in right
[1:58:47] now
[1:58:48] and God's word would begin to work
[1:58:51] beneath the wings
[1:58:54] remember that
[1:58:56] that the Hebrew word for without form in
[1:59:00] Genesis 1 2 is the same word that is
[1:59:04] translated waste in Deuteronomy 32 and
[1:59:08] 10. does anybody remember what
[1:59:10] Deuteronomy 32 talks about
[1:59:13] you don't have to I'm going to read it
[1:59:15] for you
[1:59:15] Deuteronomy 32 beginning in verse 9.
[1:59:18] let's get a few verses here and we'll
[1:59:21] try to hurry along
[1:59:22] for the large portion
[1:59:25] is his people
[1:59:27] Jacob is the lot
[1:59:29] of his inheritance now look at verse 10.
[1:59:33] he found him in a desert land
[1:59:38] and in the waist howling wilderness
[1:59:44] that word waste is without form
[1:59:48] A wilderness without form he led him
[1:59:52] about he instructed him Jacob later
[1:59:56] Israel
[1:59:58] he kept him as what
[2:00:01] the apple of his eye now let's put this
[2:00:04] in context how many of you know what
[2:00:06] verse 11 is anybody
[2:00:08] show them
[2:00:10] as an eagle
[2:00:16] this verse
[2:00:18] speaks directly of God redeeming a
[2:00:23] fallen people and making a mighty nation
[2:00:25] out of them
[2:00:27] as the eagle stirreth up her nest what
[2:00:30] is that word fluttereth
[2:00:33] same word
[2:00:35] same work of the spirit
[2:00:39] even when Jacob was in trouble
[2:00:43] even when he was in trouble there the
[2:00:47] spirit of almighty God was around him
[2:00:51] stirring up the nest
[2:00:53] shifting things making them difficult
[2:00:56] and fluttering over him
[2:00:59] because he was a part of the seed word
[2:01:01] of God it was from him that a nation was
[2:01:05] coming forth how many of you understand
[2:01:07] who Jacob is his name was change what
[2:01:11] to Israel Israel spread at the broader
[2:01:15] Wings taketh them beareth them on her
[2:01:18] wings let's read on so the Lord alone
[2:01:21] did lead him and there was no strange
[2:01:24] god with him he made him ride on the
[2:01:27] high places of the earth that he might
[2:01:29] eat the increase of the fields and he
[2:01:31] made him to suck honey
[2:01:33] out of the Rock
[2:01:37] and oil
[2:01:39] out of the flinty Rock
[2:01:42] look at the provision
[2:01:45] that God made
[2:01:47] for Jacob
[2:01:49] he began to suck honey out of the Rock
[2:01:51] and oil out of the flinty rock butter of
[2:01:54] kind milk of sheep with the fat of lambs
[2:01:57] and Rams of the breed of Bashan and
[2:02:01] goats with the fat of kidneys of Wheat
[2:02:03] and thou did his drink the pure blood of
[2:02:05] the great this is God's speaking
[2:02:07] prophetically of what he was doing to
[2:02:09] Jacob to take him out of himself
[2:02:13] to redeem him and restore him and make a
[2:02:16] mighty man out of him how many of you
[2:02:18] know in order for that to happen Jacob
[2:02:20] had to go into a wrestling match
[2:02:23] he had to have his hip dislocated and it
[2:02:26] left him with a lip
[2:02:30] and he walked differently than other men
[2:02:33] and it was not the mark of a handicap it
[2:02:36] was the mark of a god
[2:02:39] who had called him and set him apart and
[2:02:41] redeemed him and flooded over him are
[2:02:43] you with me like an eagle flutters over
[2:02:46] her nest like the spirit of God brooded
[2:02:48] over the seed that lay beneath the
[2:02:50] surface of the water what what a story
[2:02:53] what a story this is
[2:02:56] he found Jacob in the wilderness without
[2:03:00] form
[2:03:03] broken down
[2:03:05] and he made something out of him Isaiah
[2:03:07] 45 18 for the saith the Lord that
[2:03:10] created the heavens God himself that
[2:03:13] formed the Earth and made it he hath
[2:03:15] established it he created it not in vain
[2:03:18] Isaiah 45 18. I think I gave you that
[2:03:26] he hath established it he created it not
[2:03:30] in vain he formed it to be inhabited I
[2:03:34] am the lord and there is none also or
[2:03:36] none else
[2:03:38] so God is telling us here through the
[2:03:40] prophet Isaiah that he didn't make the
[2:03:41] Earth
[2:03:42] to be an uninhabitable place
[2:03:44] he made it to be inhabited look at one
[2:03:47] more place Isaiah 51 verse 15 and 16.
[2:03:51] I'm pretty sure you have this one but I
[2:03:53] am the Lord thy God that divideth the
[2:03:56] sea whose waves roared the Lord of hosts
[2:03:59] is his name and I have put my words in
[2:04:02] thy mouth and I have covered thee in the
[2:04:05] shadow of my hand that I may plant the
[2:04:07] heavens and lay the foundations of the
[2:04:10] earth and say unto Zion Thou Art my
[2:04:13] people
[2:04:14] now I don't know if you understand the
[2:04:16] analogy and the poetic language that
[2:04:19] keeps showing up in the prophets when
[2:04:21] they are speaking about Israel becoming
[2:04:24] a nation and God redeeming his people
[2:04:26] but it's always this analogy of creation
[2:04:30] of redemption of God taking from the
[2:04:34] from the chaos and creating something
[2:04:37] beautiful I want you to know the God
[2:04:40] that I serve has the innate and and
[2:04:43] unalienable a privilege and and blessing
[2:04:47] this amazing nature
[2:04:50] that he is able to take from the chaos
[2:04:55] and Draw Something Beautiful
[2:04:59] Something Beautiful
[2:05:03] something good
[2:05:06] oh my confusion
[2:05:10] he
[2:05:11] understood oh it's high all I had to
[2:05:17] offer him it ain't it ain't pretty but
[2:05:19] it's there
[2:05:21] was
[2:05:24] Brokenness and pain but he made
[2:05:29] something
[2:05:32] beautiful
[2:05:34] of my life
[2:05:41] out of the darkness
[2:05:43] out of the chaos
[2:05:45] out of the of the confusion I wish you
[2:05:48] were with me
[2:05:51] look what God did
[2:05:53] somebody said what are you talking about
[2:05:55] creation yes what are you talking about
[2:05:57] you I'm talking about your life story
[2:06:00] I'm talking about you and your Fallen
[2:06:03] condition I'm talking about you in chaos
[2:06:05] and utter darkness and void and waste
[2:06:08] and without form and it came by and he
[2:06:11] said to you just like he said to the
[2:06:13] little bloody baby that the prophet
[2:06:14] found in the wilderness
[2:06:16] I passed by thee and saw the polluted in
[2:06:19] thine own blood and said unto thee live
[2:06:22] this was a father this was a papa this
[2:06:24] was Abba taking this little Israel this
[2:06:27] little bloody baby
[2:06:28] this bloody Little Broken nation and
[2:06:31] picking her up and saying this this
[2:06:33] blood flow must stop now I'm going to
[2:06:36] restore you I'm going to bathe you with
[2:06:38] my own love and I'm going to make you a
[2:06:41] jewel among the Nations and this is why
[2:06:43] God has a bride this is why God has
[2:06:46] dealt with the Gentiles thus because he
[2:06:49] also wanted to call the people out of
[2:06:51] Gentile Nations for his name he loved
[2:06:53] Israel above all people and Above All
[2:06:55] Nations but he desired to have a people
[2:06:57] that would wear his name from among the
[2:07:00] nations from among the Gentiles how many
[2:07:02] of you feel privileged to be one of
[2:07:04] those every time you sing I'm one of
[2:07:06] them that's also what you're singing
[2:07:09] I was one who was informed and chaotic
[2:07:14] and void and shapeless
[2:07:17] and Confused
[2:07:20] but I recognized the voice of my Creator
[2:07:24] and when he called me I stepped forward
[2:07:27] just like the light separated it's are
[2:07:30] you with me
[2:07:31] you're looking around this church you
[2:07:33] need to be looking up here
[2:07:36] just like the light
[2:07:39] stepped out of the darkness you stepped
[2:07:42] out of the darkness
[2:07:43] you stepped out of your chaos
[2:07:46] you stepped out of your addiction
[2:07:50] anybody hearing me
[2:07:53] it's just spirit and water
[2:07:55] and when Spirit spoke there was a
[2:07:58] separation light is pulled from the
[2:08:00] darkness and named days
[2:08:02] and what is left in the darkness is now
[2:08:05] called night and it took evening and
[2:08:07] morning to make the first day night did
[2:08:09] not exist I want you to notice that
[2:08:11] Knight did not even exist until first
[2:08:13] light was called forth
[2:08:17] evil did not even exist until he'd
[2:08:20] already expressed himself as light
[2:08:22] and goodness
[2:08:23] evil did not pre-exist that which is
[2:08:26] right and good that which is right and
[2:08:28] good pre-existed that which was evil
[2:08:30] evil is a byproduct of a creator
[2:08:33] you believe that you understand that
[2:08:36] and so not did not exist until first
[2:08:38] light it was called forth and it was
[2:08:41] only in that light it was only when the
[2:08:43] light stepped forth that the waters
[2:08:46] could then be separated
[2:08:49] and then a few verses down I'm going
[2:08:51] somewhere it's taking me all day to get
[2:08:53] there
[2:08:54] and then a few verses down the spoken
[2:08:56] word separates again in Genesis 1. live
[2:09:00] in verse six and seven
[2:09:03] of Genesis 1 and God said let there be a
[2:09:05] firmament in the midst of the waters and
[2:09:07] let it divide the waters from the waters
[2:09:10] and God made the firmament and divided
[2:09:12] the waters which were under the
[2:09:13] firmament from the waters which were
[2:09:15] above the firmament and it was so
[2:09:17] so some of the waters from the deep were
[2:09:20] raised up
[2:09:21] above the firmament to become Waters
[2:09:25] above
[2:09:26] so this is kind of an unusual and
[2:09:28] beautiful picture
[2:09:29] God was taking from the Waters of the
[2:09:32] deep and he was dividing the waters
[2:09:35] first of all the waters are all the
[2:09:37] Waters of the deep and he divides them
[2:09:39] by placing Earth by placing a firmament
[2:09:42] by placing land in the midst of the
[2:09:45] water dividing the oceans dividing the
[2:09:48] rivers dividing land now is dividing the
[2:09:51] water and then he reaches from beneath
[2:09:53] the depth I want you to see this only
[2:09:55] because it's beautiful
[2:09:56] he reaches from the depth of the water
[2:09:59] and pulls a portion of it up into above
[2:10:03] the Earth
[2:10:05] so there are now Waters beneath the
[2:10:07] Earth
[2:10:08] and Waters above the Earth
[2:10:11] Waters beneath the firmament and Waters
[2:10:14] above the firmament and none of that
[2:10:16] could take place in the Darkness
[2:10:18] It could only take place in the light
[2:10:20] and the only way that it could take
[2:10:22] place was Creator had to speak and when
[2:10:25] Creator's voice spoke water separated
[2:10:27] and when creators voice spoke land began
[2:10:31] to boil itself up from beneath the
[2:10:32] depths of the sea I've seen it
[2:10:36] I've described it to you in vision
[2:10:39] I don't have time to do that now but I
[2:10:41] will never forget what it looked like to
[2:10:43] watch the land begin to to bubble and
[2:10:46] boil itself up from beneath the surface
[2:10:49] of the water
[2:10:50] and I began to see these little seeds of
[2:10:52] Blades of grass begin to poke up on the
[2:10:55] land until trees were formed with fruit
[2:10:58] hanging on them
[2:11:00] and I said Lord what am I seeing and he
[2:11:03] said you're seeing acceleration
[2:11:08] do you understand we're about to enter
[2:11:10] into a season where we see unprecedented
[2:11:15] acceleration
[2:11:17] and what has taken us so long to capture
[2:11:21] by the spirit
[2:11:23] we will now have moments
[2:11:26] of quick
[2:11:28] accelerated capture we will take a hold
[2:11:32] of things quicker we will join our faith
[2:11:37] with the word quicker and we will begin
[2:11:40] to see some of the fulfillments of the
[2:11:43] promised suddenlies that the word of God
[2:11:45] talks about where we labor for Years
[2:11:48] brother Hawk is up here praying
[2:11:52] it's the moment
[2:11:55] brother Hawk is up here praying and he
[2:11:57] said I've prayed for a decade
[2:12:03] many of us can say I've prayed for a
[2:12:06] decade
[2:12:07] I've prayed for a couple of decades
[2:12:11] some of us can say I've nearly prayed a
[2:12:13] generation
[2:12:18] and yet we have this promise biblically
[2:12:21] somebody said where is it at it's all
[2:12:23] through the Bible
[2:12:25] go through the Bible
[2:12:27] a time will come it's spoken to us in in
[2:12:30] in uh in typology it's spoken to us in
[2:12:34] the symbolism of the scripture and and
[2:12:36] in order for you to see that you've got
[2:12:38] to be able to see the Redemption of
[2:12:40] Jacob tied in with the creation and
[2:12:43] you've got to see that what God did in
[2:12:44] creation he did for Jacob
[2:12:48] and he's done it for you and I
[2:12:50] so then we go back and see what else did
[2:12:53] God do in creation and what else did God
[2:12:55] do for Israel and what else will God do
[2:12:58] for his bride
[2:12:59] and it gets pretty exciting
[2:13:01] anybody hear what I'm saying
[2:13:04] it gets pretty exciting it's a 111. I
[2:13:06] have a few more moments
[2:13:07] you folks have been trying to make me
[2:13:09] think it was too it ain't
[2:13:13] John chapter 1.
[2:13:15] folks we go to church twice a week
[2:13:18] you can plan your things around church
[2:13:21] if you only go twice a week
[2:13:24] you can plan things around Church
[2:13:27] it's important to do so
[2:13:30] it's important to honor the word in this
[2:13:33] hour
[2:13:33] that's why you're here you've come to
[2:13:35] honor the Lord which is the word you've
[2:13:38] come to worship the word
[2:13:40] him
[2:13:41] John 1 1-5 in the beginning was the word
[2:13:44] the word was with God the Word was God
[2:13:46] the same was in the beginning
[2:13:49] with God
[2:13:52] all things were made by him and without
[2:13:55] him was not anything made
[2:13:59] that was made
[2:14:01] in him was life
[2:14:04] and the
[2:14:06] oh
[2:14:08] fact checkers
[2:14:10] there you go
[2:14:13] yeah I heard you say life and light is
[2:14:15] the same thing and spirit and light is
[2:14:17] the Same Spirit there it is
[2:14:19] in him was life and the life was the
[2:14:23] light of men
[2:14:24] in him I'm not ready
[2:14:27] and in him was life and the life was the
[2:14:32] light of men
[2:14:34] all right now
[2:14:36] and the light did what you read it for
[2:14:38] me would you I'm a little weary shine in
[2:14:40] the darkness and the
[2:14:43] maybe you'll remember a study we did on
[2:14:45] the light we don't have time to do it
[2:14:46] now but how about I give you she doesn't
[2:14:49] have these how about I give you four
[2:14:51] different translations of that verse
[2:14:52] quickly
[2:14:53] one says I'm not going to tell you where
[2:14:55] they come from none of your business
[2:14:57] the light keep you can look them up you
[2:14:59] could all you have to do is take that
[2:15:01] Google it and it'll tell you right what
[2:15:02] translation it came from in one and I'm
[2:15:04] gonna be honest with you it's because
[2:15:05] I've got initials here and I don't
[2:15:06] remember what all of them are
[2:15:09] see I wasn't trying to be mysterious
[2:15:11] the light keeps shining in the dark and
[2:15:14] darkness has never put it out
[2:15:17] and the light shines in the darkness and
[2:15:19] the Darkness did not apprehend it
[2:15:21] the light shines in the darkness and the
[2:15:23] Darkness hasn't overcome it and the
[2:15:26] light shines in the darkness and the
[2:15:27] Darkness did not overtake it that word
[2:15:30] comprehended does not mean it didn't
[2:15:32] understand it
[2:15:34] it means it didn't put it out it didn't
[2:15:37] overcome it how many of you know the
[2:15:39] darkness will never never never never
[2:15:43] overtake the lies
[2:15:45] the darkness will never overcome the
[2:15:48] light because the light created the
[2:15:51] darkness
[2:15:53] the darkness didn't create the light
[2:15:56] the life created the darkness in him was
[2:15:59] life and that life was the light of men
[2:16:02] in John 1 verses 9 and 10 I think you
[2:16:07] have that it says that was the True
[2:16:08] Light which lighteth every man that
[2:16:11] cometh into the world he was in the
[2:16:13] world and the world was made by him you
[2:16:15] read the rest
[2:16:17] and the world knew him not here he was
[2:16:19] standing in the world the very creator
[2:16:21] of the world and the world around him
[2:16:24] including all of creation
[2:16:27] of mankind
[2:16:28] didn't even know who he was
[2:16:31] can you imagine
[2:16:36] and they didn't even know him
[2:16:39] John actually is explaining in his
[2:16:42] writing because John 1 parallels Genesis
[2:16:45] 1 in a beautiful way
[2:16:47] and John is actually explaining much of
[2:16:49] the symbolism that's used in Genesis 1
[2:16:51] notice the parallels between Genesis 1
[2:16:54] and John 1 in both we have the
[2:16:56] beginnings Darkness the word and Light
[2:17:00] the word existed before the beginning
[2:17:03] let me say it again the word existed
[2:17:07] before the beginning because the
[2:17:09] beginning was in time the word was
[2:17:12] before time the word was in eternity did
[2:17:15] you do you understand that it was with
[2:17:17] God the word was with God and the Word
[2:17:19] was God before God was God
[2:17:25] before God was God who's ever heard such
[2:17:28] a thing
[2:17:29] the bride has heard it and she
[2:17:30] understands it God is an object of
[2:17:33] worship there was a time that God
[2:17:35] existed as Elohim the all-existing are
[2:17:38] self-existing one there was no other
[2:17:40] there was no other there was no one to
[2:17:43] worship him before he made angels
[2:17:46] before he made cherubims and seraphims
[2:17:49] before he created the heavenly host and
[2:17:51] the living creatures and and all the
[2:17:53] things that we now know before he
[2:17:55] created man
[2:17:57] he existed so the word was before the
[2:18:00] beginning and in that word there was
[2:18:02] life God's life
[2:18:04] and that life was the light for man
[2:18:10] in the same manner that the light could
[2:18:12] not be distinguished from the darkness
[2:18:14] in Genesis 1 until it was called forth
[2:18:17] and separated
[2:18:19] the True Light from God which was Jesus
[2:18:21] who could not be received by many
[2:18:23] of his own the Bible said because he was
[2:18:26] hidden from them in darkness
[2:18:29] in John chapter 1 verses 10 through 13
[2:18:33] look at this and we'll we'll hurry he
[2:18:35] was in the world
[2:18:36] and the world was made by him
[2:18:39] and the world knew him not
[2:18:41] he came unto his own
[2:18:43] and his own received him not
[2:18:45] what does verse 12 say why don't you
[2:18:48] just read the whole verse for me but as
[2:18:50] many
[2:19:02] what if I were to ask you about that
[2:19:04] power what would you tell me about it
[2:19:08] what is the word Greek word for power
[2:19:12] dunamis
[2:19:14] dunamis is usually the word that is used
[2:19:17] for power
[2:19:18] it's the word where we get Dynamo or
[2:19:20] Dynamite but this is not dunamis this is
[2:19:24] exousia
[2:19:26] and this word exousia means something
[2:19:29] different than Dynamite
[2:19:32] dunamis means strength and might
[2:19:35] exousia means it's more about Authority
[2:19:40] and ability
[2:19:43] dunamis is more about strength and might
[2:19:46] exousia is more about Authority and
[2:19:50] ability
[2:19:51] so God is saying to as many as received
[2:19:54] him to them gave he the authority
[2:19:58] to become the sons of God the authority
[2:20:01] to become the sons of God and what else
[2:20:04] um
[2:20:08] did you know you not only have the
[2:20:10] authority to become a Son of God but you
[2:20:11] also have the ability to become a son of
[2:20:14] God
[2:20:15] how is that possible because there's a
[2:20:16] part of God in you
[2:20:18] and that part of God that's in you
[2:20:20] that's going to be very helpful and
[2:20:21] powerful and important in this hour is
[2:20:23] his creative nature and that's why
[2:20:26] brother Branham hangs a whole message on
[2:20:28] the power of the spoken word
[2:20:30] because he saw that there was coming a
[2:20:32] day so dark
[2:20:36] should we just stop here and finish this
[2:20:39] another time when you're not so tired
[2:20:43] I mean honestly should we do it
[2:20:47] he hung a whole message on the power of
[2:20:50] the spoken word and the creative nature
[2:20:52] Stay With Me
[2:20:54] and the creative nature of the spoken
[2:20:56] word
[2:20:57] and how that nothing shifted until the
[2:20:59] word was spoken
[2:21:01] this world would have hung forever in a
[2:21:03] chaotic unformed state had it not been
[2:21:06] for the power of the spoken word which
[2:21:09] is a creative word brother Branham
[2:21:10] emphasized that word in not only a
[2:21:12] sermon but in the in the entirety of the
[2:21:15] message the power of when God speaks
[2:21:22] the church is no longer the voice of God
[2:21:24] on the Earth
[2:21:27] Church each book
[2:21:31] she is no longer that voice
[2:21:33] she is no longer that representative
[2:21:35] it's only that which is of him bone of
[2:21:38] his bone flesh of his Flesh Blood of his
[2:21:41] blood spirit of his Spirit life of his
[2:21:44] life light of his light
[2:21:46] seed of his seed that can speak for him
[2:21:50] and that is not the church but that is a
[2:21:53] Remnant that has been called out
[2:21:55] that is his bride she is not only in
[2:21:58] Alabama but she is represented all over
[2:22:01] this world
[2:22:04] why because she heard a voice
[2:22:06] a voice that said come out of Darkness
[2:22:10] I called you in the darkness and now I'm
[2:22:13] calling you out of the darkness
[2:22:17] a voice that said exactly that
[2:22:20] exactly that let there be light
[2:22:26] how we need to understand that we are
[2:22:30] the answer
[2:22:32] we are the response to that voice
[2:22:37] when he said let there be light you and
[2:22:40] I must then step forth
[2:22:43] so we've been given both Authority and
[2:22:45] ability
[2:22:46] to become the sons of God even to them
[2:22:48] that believe on his name which were born
[2:22:50] but next verse verse 13 which were born
[2:22:53] not of blood nor of the will of the
[2:22:55] flesh nor of the will of man but how
[2:22:58] they were born hell
[2:23:04] didn't say by God
[2:23:07] the translator chose to say of God
[2:23:10] because you have come from his substance
[2:23:15] that's powerful
[2:23:18] I can say it because I'm not referring
[2:23:19] to the sermon I'm talking to the truth
[2:23:22] about the truth that's being spoken
[2:23:27] we're way too Petty
[2:23:30] far too Petty
[2:23:33] to exercise our deity
[2:23:36] far too Petty
[2:23:39] God never got through off his course
[2:23:42] God never had a bad day
[2:23:47] nothing ever took him by surprise
[2:23:50] he had total confidence in himself
[2:23:54] somebody said how could you say that
[2:23:55] because the Apostle tells us he swears
[2:23:57] To Us by two immutable things
[2:24:00] who he is
[2:24:02] his word
[2:24:03] his name
[2:24:05] his identity
[2:24:06] everything else will shake everything
[2:24:09] else will melt away everything else will
[2:24:11] fall to the Wayside but there is
[2:24:13] something that is immutable there is
[2:24:15] something that cannot move there's
[2:24:16] something that cannot be shaken there's
[2:24:18] something that can never be changed
[2:24:23] there was always the word
[2:24:25] John 1 says Genesis 1 there was always
[2:24:28] the word but it had to be spoken before
[2:24:30] The Light Within it
[2:24:33] could be fully manifested
[2:24:35] there was always the word
[2:24:37] but the word had to be spoken there was
[2:24:40] always the word
[2:24:41] anybody with me there was always the
[2:24:44] word but the word had to be
[2:24:47] what the word have to be
[2:24:49] just like in the beginning Genesis 1
[2:24:51] nothing could happen no change could
[2:24:53] transpire until God spoke
[2:24:58] and God said
[2:25:00] God is light
[2:25:02] and God spoke to the light
[2:25:04] and told the light to come forth
[2:25:07] you think the resurrection is
[2:25:10] what do you think the Rapture is
[2:25:12] it's the light calling to the light get
[2:25:15] up
[2:25:16] get up get up get up
[2:25:19] you're hidden in darkness the dead in
[2:25:21] Christ hidden in darkness
[2:25:23] but they shall rise when first
[2:25:26] John 8 12 then spake Jesus again unto
[2:25:28] them saying I am the light of the world
[2:25:30] he that followeth me shall not walk in
[2:25:32] darkness but shall have the light of
[2:25:34] Life what a wonderful time to talk about
[2:25:35] light
[2:25:37] we're about to celebrate the Festival of
[2:25:39] Lights
[2:25:40] we're about to celebrate the Feast of
[2:25:42] dedication or what we call Hanukkah
[2:25:46] we're about to focus on the miraculous
[2:25:49] power of God to shine light
[2:25:52] in a world that is incredibly dark
[2:25:56] and there is no fear in the light
[2:25:59] the light has no fear to manifest itself
[2:26:01] in darkness because when the light steps
[2:26:03] forth the darkness has no option
[2:26:07] other than to shrink back do you know
[2:26:10] that when you walk into a room in the
[2:26:12] authority and the ability of a Son of
[2:26:14] God that the Demons of Hell have to pull
[2:26:16] back
[2:26:20] somebody said well I don't really feel
[2:26:22] them retreating that's because you're
[2:26:24] not speaking
[2:26:25] Who You Are
[2:26:28] that's because we have become
[2:26:31] thermometers
[2:26:33] instead of thermostats
[2:26:37] we spend more time reflecting the way it
[2:26:39] is the way it looks the way it seems the
[2:26:42] way it feels then we do what we know it
[2:26:44] ought to be
[2:26:45] when you and I start having the faith to
[2:26:48] speak it like it ought to be
[2:26:51] remember we're forerunners of the light
[2:26:52] we're not for running Darkness we're for
[2:26:54] running light remember that the evening
[2:26:57] and the morning I gotta hurry remember
[2:27:00] that the evening and the morning were
[2:27:01] the first day not the morning and the
[2:27:03] evening
[2:27:04] so guess when the day got new
[2:27:06] to guess when the season gets new
[2:27:10] when it's still dark outside we are
[2:27:12] Trailblazers we are forerunners of the
[2:27:15] light the holy spirit said I'm calling
[2:27:17] you to walk the razor's Edge
[2:27:22] I'm calling you to be Trailblazers
[2:27:26] brother Tremaine took the word of the
[2:27:28] Lord so literal he made himself a a
[2:27:30] license plate because the word of the
[2:27:32] Lord said I'm calling you to be my
[2:27:33] forerunners in this generation and he
[2:27:36] put Forerunner on his license plate
[2:27:38] somebody looks at that and says silly
[2:27:40] old man I'm going to say silly old
[2:27:42] church
[2:27:43] that doesn't realize how literal these
[2:27:46] truths are
[2:27:48] and if you've got to write it on your
[2:27:50] mirror write it on your mirror
[2:27:54] you shouldn't have no lipstick around
[2:28:01] if you do you don't need it around
[2:28:05] if God would have wanted your lips to
[2:28:07] look like that he'd have made them that
[2:28:08] way when you got here
[2:28:11] the only reason why that's even
[2:28:13] attractive in this Society is
[2:28:15] pornography
[2:28:18] [Music]
[2:28:22] one time a preacher friend of mine came
[2:28:24] to me and said I've got a real problem
[2:28:26] he said I I I really really really like
[2:28:29] to see my wife in ruby red lipstick he
[2:28:32] said do you think God Minds if it's just
[2:28:34] privacy and and just us and nobody knows
[2:28:36] anything about it I said yes he Minds
[2:28:39] because you didn't get that desire to
[2:28:41] see her that way from God
[2:28:43] you got it from your magazines
[2:28:48] you got it from the videos
[2:28:51] come on now
[2:28:58] I don't even know why I said that
[2:29:00] well I'm going back I wouldn't back up
[2:29:02] now for nothing
[2:29:08] specialism
[2:29:11] can you imagine
[2:29:14] botulism squirted in their face
[2:29:20] so they can look Forever Young
[2:29:24] let me tell you something folks get
[2:29:27] things Mighty out of whack
[2:29:32] you might do away with your wrinkle
[2:29:33] lines but you should be more concerned
[2:29:35] about what's going on in your heart
[2:29:38] than your wrinkle lines
[2:29:40] anybody know what I'm talking about
[2:29:45] if you if you don't have any any markers
[2:29:48] or something put it on a stick it note
[2:29:55] post it somewhere remind yourself I am
[2:29:59] not going to be a thermometer today
[2:30:03] I'm going to be a thermostat I'm going
[2:30:06] to speak it the way it should be
[2:30:09] I'm going to speak the mind of God
[2:30:11] instead of my own mind help me now
[2:30:17] I saw the authority a man can have over
[2:30:19] a body
[2:30:21] I was in Singapore with Bobby Conner
[2:30:24] when he had a heart attack
[2:30:27] I was just there as a guest we were on
[2:30:29] our way we had I don't worry I think I'd
[2:30:32] come from Israel
[2:30:33] and maybe we're going back to Israel
[2:30:37] and he was to be a speaker
[2:30:39] but the Lord had given me something and
[2:30:42] I did I was not invited speaker I was
[2:30:43] there as a guest
[2:30:45] and I wasn't to speak
[2:30:47] I heard a commotion out in the hallway
[2:30:49] one night I looked out the people and
[2:30:51] there were doctors rushing into Bobby's
[2:30:52] room
[2:30:53] come to find out he had a heart attack
[2:30:55] in the night was rushed to the hospital
[2:30:57] for open heart surgery
[2:30:59] I spent most of the night praying for
[2:31:01] him waiting for a report
[2:31:03] someone knocked on my door very early
[2:31:05] and said they've asked that you would
[2:31:07] take Bobby's place today and speak I
[2:31:09] said okay I'll be glad to do that and
[2:31:11] when we got through speaking we went to
[2:31:13] the hospital and he was recovering
[2:31:16] I'll never forget the sight
[2:31:19] most of you know that Bobby Conner is a
[2:31:21] large man
[2:31:22] charismatic prophetic speaker out there
[2:31:25] on the circuits and a nice man nice
[2:31:27] brother
[2:31:28] I think he just turned 70 years old
[2:31:30] recently maybe
[2:31:32] and he's a big fellow and there are not
[2:31:35] many big people in Singapore
[2:31:40] they had weaved three gowns together
[2:31:44] to make him a gown
[2:31:46] and I've never seen such a big man on
[2:31:49] such a little Gurney
[2:31:50] foreign
[2:31:52] he was laying there and he was playing
[2:31:54] with the doctors
[2:31:56] the doctors were standing there these
[2:31:58] Singaporean doctors with their mouths
[2:32:00] hung open because they they would they
[2:32:02] said to him they come in they said well
[2:32:03] everything's going well you're going to
[2:32:05] do good and he did indeed and I don't
[2:32:07] know why I had to have a heart attack
[2:32:08] and I don't know why I had to have open
[2:32:09] heart surgery and I don't understand all
[2:32:12] those things but it happened
[2:32:14] and yet he was in there playing with the
[2:32:16] doctors the doctor said your heartbeat
[2:32:18] is a little high I'd like to keep you
[2:32:20] here until we can get that heart rate a
[2:32:22] little lower he said where do you want
[2:32:23] me to put it
[2:32:27] the little doctor said I have no idea
[2:32:29] what you mean
[2:32:32] he said just tell me what you wanted to
[2:32:33] be he said well it should be it sentence
[2:32:35] that right now it's going to be a little
[2:32:36] high because of what's happened but he
[2:32:38] said it ought to be about such and such
[2:32:39] and Bobby said okay watch the monitor
[2:32:44] I leaned in myself
[2:32:49] it was only a few seconds I watched that
[2:32:52] thing dropping down to exactly where the
[2:32:54] doctor wanted it
[2:32:56] yeah
[2:32:57] he said that's the power of the creator
[2:33:01] he looked to the doctor and he said that
[2:33:02] wasn't me that was the creator that can
[2:33:04] do that I just have to be in touch with
[2:33:06] him well I knew it wasn't witchcraft I
[2:33:09] knew God was teaching me something
[2:33:13] I've been using some of that Authority
[2:33:14] this week I'm very new in it I'm having
[2:33:18] to learn how to operate in it but I
[2:33:21] believe that God gives his bride both
[2:33:23] Authority and ability
[2:33:25] to function as sons of God
[2:33:28] we may not need it right now but one of
[2:33:31] these days we may need to regulate there
[2:33:33] may be no blood pressure medication and
[2:33:35] I'm not on any by the way
[2:33:38] there may be no heart tablet to keep
[2:33:40] your heart pumping
[2:33:42] there may not be something to control
[2:33:44] your afib you may have to do it by Faith
[2:33:46] by speaking the word by believing for a
[2:33:49] new heart
[2:33:51] we've got to come to a place where we
[2:33:54] really know that God is with us
[2:33:56] and we're going to have to start talking
[2:33:58] like it
[2:34:00] I am the light of the world he that
[2:34:03] father with me shall not walk in
[2:34:04] darkness but shall have the light of
[2:34:06] Life John 8 12. but shall have the light
[2:34:10] of life
[2:34:12] first John 1 5.
[2:34:14] this is the message which we have heard
[2:34:16] of him and declare unto you that God is
[2:34:19] light
[2:34:20] read the rest
[2:34:27] there is separation from darkness that
[2:34:30] takes place and we are called forth into
[2:34:33] the light and we now identify as
[2:34:36] children of the day as forerunners of
[2:34:39] the light and we speak the truth
[2:34:42] it causes the def the separation it
[2:34:45] causes the darkness to pull back let me
[2:34:47] give you one more scripture in closing
[2:34:49] first Thessalonians 5 6-10 therefore let
[2:34:53] us not sleep as do others let us
[2:34:59] doesn't mean we don't take sleep at
[2:35:01] night
[2:35:05] therefore let us not sleep as do others
[2:35:06] but let us watch and be sober
[2:35:09] for they that for they that sleep sleep
[2:35:12] in the night and they that be drunken or
[2:35:15] Drunken In the Night
[2:35:16] but let us who are of the day be sober
[2:35:19] putting on the breastplate of faith and
[2:35:21] love did you do it this morning
[2:35:27] and for an helmet
[2:35:30] read it
[2:35:33] for God had not appointed us to Wrath
[2:35:37] but to obtain salvation by our Lord
[2:35:39] Jesus Christ this is all about the hour
[2:35:41] we're living in now it's also a prophecy
[2:35:43] concerning the resurrection of the Bride
[2:35:46] we were not appointed to wrath the bride
[2:35:48] was not appointed to see the last three
[2:35:50] and a half years of the Great
[2:35:51] Tribulation for God had not appointed us
[2:35:53] to wrath but to obtain salvation by our
[2:35:55] Lord Jesus Christ
[2:35:58] if you wanted to read that in Hebrew you
[2:36:00] would say uh but he has go back uh go
[2:36:04] back
[2:36:06] for God had not appointed us to wrath
[2:36:08] but to obtain Yeshua
[2:36:11] because his Hebrew name means what
[2:36:13] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:36:18] so don't be so mystified if I pray using
[2:36:20] both names
[2:36:22] who died for us that whether we wake or
[2:36:24] sleep we should live together with him
[2:36:28] do you know what we ought to be doing
[2:36:31] we ought to be out there saying let
[2:36:34] there be light
[2:36:38] let there be light have you got a
[2:36:40] situation that looks dark
[2:36:42] hold up your hand if you do
[2:36:46] have you got some troubles and trials
[2:36:48] that look cloudy
[2:36:50] shadowy
[2:36:51] iffy then you have authority and ability
[2:36:56] to be the sons of God
[2:36:58] we can shift the darkness we have the
[2:37:02] authority to speak to it let there be
[2:37:06] light
[2:37:08] but don't use your authority to
[2:37:10] resuscitate something that God is trying
[2:37:13] to kill
[2:37:15] did you hear him
[2:37:17] did you hear him
[2:37:21] don't spend your effort breathing life
[2:37:24] into something that God is trying to
[2:37:26] kill
[2:37:29] Let It Go
[2:37:32] your season is changing
[2:37:35] Let It Go I want to tell you something
[2:37:37] Pride I'm speaking to somebody
[2:37:40] Pride will cause you to prop up what God
[2:37:44] has already rejected
[2:37:48] can you hear him
[2:37:53] sometimes things are already called to
[2:37:55] an end and you and I are stooped over
[2:38:04] we mean well
[2:38:07] but remember the root of meaning well
[2:38:09] sometime is really Pride
[2:38:14] we don't want to admit that something
[2:38:17] that we have put our hands to has failed
[2:38:20] but how many of you know that just
[2:38:22] because you haven't seen the results you
[2:38:23] were looking for doesn't mean it was a
[2:38:25] failure
[2:38:26] it simply means that it served its
[2:38:28] purpose in your life and now God's
[2:38:30] calling you to something else
[2:38:32] look folks you're going to have to get
[2:38:34] over holding on to unfinished business
[2:38:36] sometime and saying well I can't turn
[2:38:38] that loose because I didn't finish my
[2:38:40] course I didn't finish my job listen you
[2:38:42] better do what the spirit says if the
[2:38:44] spirit's telling you to get out of there
[2:38:46] you better get out of there if the
[2:38:48] spirit's telling you to hang there you
[2:38:49] better hang there
[2:38:51] yes
[2:38:52] yes now let me tell you what the spirit
[2:38:54] won't do the spirit will not tell you to
[2:38:57] walk off your job so that somebody else
[2:38:59] can take care of you
[2:39:03] so let's not get weird
[2:39:08] if God is calling you out of something
[2:39:11] he's already opened something up for you
[2:39:14] you may not see it yet
[2:39:17] you may not recognize it yet
[2:39:21] but it's so
[2:39:23] I don't need that anymore
[2:39:27] it's time for someone to get out of the
[2:39:29] Void
[2:39:30] to get out of the waste
[2:39:32] to get out of that unformed chaotic
[2:39:35] place that you've been walking in in
[2:39:36] this last season it's time for someone
[2:39:38] to tell to tell the darkness
[2:39:42] you you hold back
[2:39:44] I'm calling the light forward into this
[2:39:46] situation

[2:40:11] given both the ability
[2:40:13] and the authority to do something about
[2:40:15] it
[2:40:16] I don't know what the situations of your
[2:40:18] life look like before we started talking
[2:40:21] about change but I know some for some of
[2:40:23] you it's been very difficult but if we
[2:40:25] can get this message into our heart if
[2:40:27] we can get an understanding of what God
[2:40:29] is already trying to lead us into you'll
[2:40:32] begin to declare and the word of God is
[2:40:34] nigh you
[2:40:36] the word of God is nigh you it is near
[2:40:39] to you and let me tell you how close it
[2:40:40] is
[2:40:41] it's in your mouth
[2:40:43] it's in your mouth
[2:40:45] it's in your mouth and that's not
[2:40:47] religious
[2:40:48] religion is when you're trying to make
[2:40:50] something happen watch me
[2:40:53] religion is when you're trying to make
[2:40:54] something happen
[2:40:58] oh foolish Galatians
[2:41:01] you can't make it happen
[2:41:03] only God can make it happen that's what
[2:41:05] religion will do for you it'll make you
[2:41:07] jump through all the Hoops because
[2:41:09] you're wanting to earn the trophies
[2:41:13] when you get a revelation of Truth you
[2:41:15] understand what the trophy is you don't
[2:41:17] wait to Heaven you don't wait till you
[2:41:19] get to heaven to get the crown
[2:41:22] you don't wait till you get to heaven to
[2:41:24] get the trophy
[2:41:25] you don't wait till you get to heaven to
[2:41:27] get the prize once you get a revelation
[2:41:29] of who the prize is who the trophy is
[2:41:32] who the crown is

[2:41:39] I've already got my reward
[2:41:41] I'm gonna have a Celestial city to live
[2:41:43] in one day but that is not my reward
[2:41:46] I'm on a drink out of a river of life
[2:41:49] but that is not my reward
[2:41:52] I'm going to live in his presence but
[2:41:54] that is not my reward my reward is to
[2:41:57] have him now
[2:41:58] to know who he is in me now to know my
[2:42:02] responsibility now and to appreciate my
[2:42:05] authority now and to begin to use it to
[2:42:07] speak light
[2:42:10] into the darkness
