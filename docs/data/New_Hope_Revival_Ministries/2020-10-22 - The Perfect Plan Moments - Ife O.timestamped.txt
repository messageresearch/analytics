[0:00] there's something about walking in the
[0:02] will of god
[0:03] that it gives you a stamina that you
[0:06] didn't previously have
[0:08] [Music]
[0:15] but i am sure that god always works on
[0:18] both ends
[0:19] he knows how to put everything in divine
[0:22] order
[0:23] and when you talk to the lord and you
[0:25] begin to lay some things out
[0:27] cause you really desire to fulfill the
[0:30] will of the lord the plan of god in your
[0:33] life
[0:33] i believe that he works on both ends he
[0:36] will begin to put all things in divine
[0:39] order
[0:39] that is why friends that it is necessary
[0:42] that we do not walk in the permissive
[0:45] will of god
[0:46] but we find ourselves walking in the
[0:50] perfect will of god all of our life to
[0:53] be in alignment with our heavenly father
[0:56] and to see his will come to pass and so
[0:59] that
[0:59] all of these things can line up and he
[1:02] can accomplish what he desires to
[1:05] for us in this hour in our lives at the
[1:08] specific
[1:09] hour it's to take place we want to see
[1:11] heaven and earth
[1:13] locked in a kiss where that we know that
[1:16] we're right in the middle
[1:18] of the smack and we are able to find
[1:22] the will of god even if it becomes
[1:25] painful at times knowing that these
[1:28] pains are working the purposes of god in
[1:32] us but there's something about walking
[1:35] in the will of god
[1:36] that it gives you a stamina that you
[1:39] didn't previously have
[1:41] it gives you something to spur you
[1:44] forward
[1:45] all to know the mind of god for your
[1:49] life
[1:49] that when the enemy comes and starts
[1:52] poking at you
[1:53] when you're in a dark place when you
[1:56] feel like did i miss god
[1:58] how if if i am in the plan of god how
[2:01] is it that i feel the way that i do and
[2:04] the enemy begins
[2:05] poking at you and poking at you and
[2:07] poking at you
[2:08] that you know that you're in the will of
[2:11] god this perfect will
[2:12] and you can point the enemy back and say
[2:15] listen here devil
[2:16] i want you to know that i prayed and god
[2:20] answered and i saw all these things
[2:22] lining out
[2:23] and i know that i know that i know that
[2:26] i'm walking in the will of god for my
[2:28] life
[2:29] we don't need to worry about what people
[2:31] are saying about
[2:32] us if we've been in prayer and we've
[2:35] been seeking the
[2:36] face of god and saying lord i want to
[2:39] walk in your perfect plan
[2:41] and i know that this is the way that
[2:43] i've always done it but i'm feeling
[2:45] i'm sensing now i'm hearing your voice
[2:48] that this is not the way that you're
[2:49] gonna do it this time
[2:51] okay lord i am willing to take the wrap
[2:54] for it
[2:55] i am willing to be ridiculed i'm willing
[2:58] to be talked about
[3:00] but i've got to walk in the plan of god
