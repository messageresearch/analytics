very much I forgot to welcome Hannah and Rachel from Virginia kenzer God bless them let's give them a greeting [Applause] you all can stand up again let's all stand for the reading of the word God is good are you ready to hear from his word yes let's turn to Mark chap 11 verse 23 and 24 I'm going to take this loen Leng out for just a moment but I may have to put it back in forgive me for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart that's an important phrase and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith can I read that one again he said for verily I say unto you all red letters that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart it not only matters what you say it matters what you believe and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever someone say that with me whatsoever he saith uh that is creative power in your mouth but it's important for you to believe that's right it's not just declaring it but it's believing it with all of your heart amen and then verse 24 therefore I say unto you what things soever ye desire When you pray believe that you receive receive them and ye shall have them now the believe brother brandham tells us is present tense the shall let's see that verse again the shall is sometimes a future tense but it's sure in other words he may not come when you want him but he's right on time is there anybody in here that can testify tonight that Jesus keeps all of his appointments and if we believe in our heart then what comes out of our mouth we can hold in our hand We Believe now we speak now and we expect that now or in the future God will perform the word that he has promised if you believe that I want you to shout amen amen may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated I want to minister tonight and again in the morning on receiving a Divine promise from God and I want to subtitle it this evening watch the order of the word now there's a whole lot of talk around the message of the hour concerning Church order and let me just answer your question concerning Church order every church is Sovereign that answers that let every Pastor let every leadership seek the Lord and know the mind of God for how the church service should be conducted no two churches have to be alike you may not like the song I sing I may not like the song you sing but we're singing it unto the Lord there are some Churches who believe that if you sing a song that's not 50 years old than it couldn't possibly line up with the word well we know better than that because we know that even the spirit of God can drop on us and someone can sing Under inspiration a song that's never been written before what the New Testament calls a spiritual song and so we we've got to be careful when we're when we're trying to put our uh preference on somebody else amen and so down through the years it has been that way that folks have come and said well we don't believe in Drums well don't have any drums in your church and I'll support you right now if you do if you believe it's all right well then fine then somebody said well they get a little carried away well you know it's hard when the anointing Falls it's hard not to use your gift with all your might so we know a little bit about church order but tonight I want to talk a little bit as a subtitle about about the order of the word receiving a Divine promise from God watching the order of the word God never breaks his order in his word if he ever did it one way one time he's able to do it again just like he did it the time before you believe that don't you now everything that God can do is not written in the word we know that because the Bible says we mentioned the other night that if everything Jesus did in his three and a half years of Earthly Ministry if it were all recorded in books the whole universe could not contain the books that would be written about his works on the earth and so there are some things that are not recorded but here's what we must remember God will never move against his word I don't care what you dream what you hear what you think what you believe if it doesn't line up with the word of God we're obligated as Believers to leave it alone now I don't know if there's anybody in here tonight that has a need to receive a promise from God in in manifestation or sometimes brother brandham said materialization when it materializes it's good to have a promise isn't it it's good to tote it around in the fly leaf of your Bible it's good to remember it and testify about it and talk about it but how many of you know that we're coming to an hour where we need to see that promise become a reality come to fruition in our life you can't really fight the devil with just a promise but as God begins to perform that promise in your life and it begins to materialize before your eyes it boosts your faith and you begin to go back and think about all the other things that God has said he wanted to do in our lives there's a huge Destiny for the New Testament Church there's still a huge Destiny for the Bride of Jesus Christ if you believe it say amen and so it's not over yet I want you to tell somebody it's not over yet God's still moving and he's not decreasing and whimpering away he's increasing in power and might according to our faith if we can only believe if we can only believe did you come to help the word help me preach the word tonight all right good I'm waiting on you in a message called spiritual food in due season just as a little way of of introducing the subject tonight I want to read paragraph 157 now he told us if thou can't believe if you can say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt it in your heart but believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have it well that's just what we read in the word isn't it so we've got to say Amen to that he said when you pray believe that you receive it it'll be given to you what a promise can anybody thank God for that promise and then let's grab in we have found him come and see I want to pick up two paragraphs for you there just to kind of set the scene here paragraph 21 he said then he's here is that right he said wherever two or three are gathered no matter how small a group two or three I'll be in their midst haven't you seen God show up when there was just a handful of people and prayer meeting where there was less than a dozen and God showed up so real he doesn't have to have a crowd to move he moves according to our faith there's enough faith in this room right now to create a world out there somewhere we've just got to learn how to use that faith and we've got to learn how to position ourselves to receive a Divine promise from God in manifestation and we're going to get somewhere with this tonight he he said I'll be in their midst what anything they ask shall receive it now he said that's either right or it's wrong that's either the word or it's not the word he said Jesus said if ye abide in me and my word in you you can ask what you will it'll be done I'm going to put the be there it'll done to you it'll be done to you because that's what the word said now anybody in here need a manifestation of a promise in your life I want to make sure that this is the right message for the right time I believe it is but I don't want to preach a whole message and and it not apply to anybody so if you're here and you believe God has given you a promise and you've not yet seen that promise in manifestation and you'd like to you believe the season is Drawing Near maybe it's the salvation of your loved ones maybe it's getting rid of that nagging root symptom in your body so that you can be totally made whole maybe it's seeing your grandchildren baptized with the Holy Ghost is there anybody that's got a promise like that and you would like to begin to see that manifest okay all right I think there's enough of you that ought to be able to to get a hold of this then whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe believe believe you receive very simple believe it and you receive it he said but watch the order of the word now now we're talking about receiving a Divine promise from God now we're talking about watching the order of the word God's not going to break the order of the word it's not going to fall on your head like ripe cherries from a tree all right you're not just going to come up with some kind of uh you know desire something out there Something In the Flesh even a solish ambition and you just start declaring that all over town that doesn't have to come to pass you may never get that if you want to see the manifestation of your Divine promise then we've got to watch the order of the word and when we watch the order of the word we'll see how it is to come to pass in our life and here it is he said you believe now you receive receive it it shall be given to you tonight see he can't do nothing for you I'm going to let that sink in I'm going to take my time and let you hear it well tonight yes sir you can't he can't he can't do nothing for you until first you believe it and say believe it and say let's say that again believe it and say he can't do nothing for you he can't do anything for you until first you believe it and say yeah now what are we supposed to say he has done it now I want you to declare that into the promise that you're waiting to come to fruition and manifestation in your life I want you to think about the Deliverance of your loved ones I want you to think about what is the thing that you mentioned the first first above all when you pray what is the first thing what's the biggest thing that you're holding on to God to bring to pass in your life then if you want to see the fruition of that you're going to have to watch the order of the word he can't do anything for you until first you believe it and say he has done it Hallelujah and so this doesn't just run through our mind and we let it go he says to us let me let that soak real deep yeah now that sounds like Faith 101 Christianity 10 101 but brother brandom is preaching to a mixed multitude maybe I'm preaching to a mixed multitude tonight as it goes out over the stream to the nations of the world maybe there are some who are not quite familiar with the concept of watching the order of the word he can't do anything for you until first you believe it and then you must say that he has done it it's the prophetic power of a testimony it's the prophetic power of a confession somebody say I've got to confess it I've got to speak it I've got to say it and I've got to believe it now he gets really plain as we go along but we want to let this soak in real deep the next paragraph he said how many correctly understands that no matter how SI you are what about it you've got to First believe he does it do you believe he's a Healer do you believe he's still a Healer do you believe that nothing is impossible with him you've got to First believe he does it and then confess not that he will do it not that he can do it we usually say Lord I believe we pray our prayer and then we say Lord I believe you can do this that's not the order of the word the order of the word is not to thank him that he can do it it is to declare that he has done it that is a past statement here he has done it remember the prophet told us that that if Jesus were standing in the midst of us tonight even walking down the aisle he couldn't do anything for us tonight that he hasn't already done he's already done it he's already done it you may wonder why I'm so worked up about this well God's been dealing with my heart I I I I hear that there should be no more delay in the hour of the sounding of the seventh Angel's message there should be no more delay in King James it says time shall be no more but in the original it it SE says there should be no more delay is anybody with me is anybody tired of delay has anybody got some hope deferred hanging on in your life because you've been waiting and you've been waiting and you've been waiting and you've been waiting and you've been waiting now we've got to excuse me we've got to watch the order of the word first we've got to believe it and then we've got to confess not that he can if he wants to or that he's able to but that he has done it you know I taught you years ago that we pray the wrong prayer Lord save my loved ones that's not the order of the word that's religion that's denominational talk Lord please save my loved ones if you're praying that way you're asking him to do something that he's already already made atonement for if brother Isaiah Brooks was here he'd Cut Loose into that song what more can he do what more can he do he's laid a foundation he's opened up the way what more can he do he bled what more what more can he do and so we're not asking God to save him rather we're asking the Lord to bring them to a place where they see their need of him and then they've got to follow the order of the word there's no escaping the order of the word they've got to follow the same order of the word you do they've got to believe it and then they've got to confess that he has done it I've told you before my grandmother standing over the the the body of my grandfather Kos now for hours a massive aneurism has happened in his brain and the blood has surged loose through through his body and one by one we began to watch as his toes began to die and the circulation in his leg began to to pass and we watched it becoming black and and they told us this is the this is the way he's going to die and then when that blood backs up into his organs it's going to start it's going to start shutting those organs down and this seemed like an awful terrible drawn out process to us my grandmother and I neither one were sure that my grandfather was ready to meet the Lord and the doctor said he will not wake up that that that ship has sailed if you're expecting to say goodbye you say it he can likely hear you but he will not be able to respond well you just don't tell people to Faith that my granny said honey come up here to this bedside let you and I agree in the name of Jesus that God will wake him out out of that K sleep and give us an opportunity to have peace that he has made everything right with the Lord so we just ask God to do it just according to our faith and then we called it done and and I said Papa wake up yeah and you know what it shocked us here we are praying I'm not the only one praying believing confessing you know claiming singing all of things you do to get the spirit of God around you and and then he sits straight up in the bed setting off alarms all the way down the hall nurses come running he opened his eyes he looked right at my grandmother she said honey do you know you're saved do you know that the Lord has forgiven you of all of your sins he looked her right in the eye and he said hope so I hope so she said no no no no not hope so you've got to know so we begin to pray he began to call out to the Lord for mercy and the nurses that had just made it back to the to the nurses station here they come running again because they heard his voice screaming out Lord have mercy on me and save me when we knew that he had called on the Lord he he closed his eyes he he laid back down in the bed he never moved another uh not even another twitch until the Lord called him home but we had peace my granny taught me something in that moment we can't have a hope so faith that we're going to see the manifestation of a Divine promise come on we've got to have a no so Faith you can't hope you're saved you've got to know you're saved you can't hope you have the Holy Ghost you've got to know you've received the bap baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire you can't hope that he's a Healer and then pray some little prayer that you don't believe you've got to follow the order of the word you've got to accept that he's a Healer and believe it that's the A and the B except believ in what was the C confess confess can you believe that no I didn't fall I'm okay did not fall all is well just getting a little excited there something to get excited about we've got a lot a lot of potential we can see God do anything we need to see him do if we can get the order of the word right believe it then confess not that he can not that he will but that he has done it it's finished how many of you believe calvary's work is finished then he said then confess that he has done it be before listen before he can even go to work on it did you know he might not have even started working on your promise did you know your promise may be just hanging around him like it's hanging around you I'll show you something else he said in a minute that'll that'll verify that he may not have even started working on the materialization of the promise the work that's needed to finish the promise is done but he may not have even started moving things around to help you position to receive the promise because you haven't taken the time to believe and confess that he has done it Lord I Thank you that every one of my children are are saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost Lord I Thank you that every one of my children are going to stand in the middle of their Destiny in the end time and not devil or demon can come and hinder them from doing what God has called them to do because Lord you've already done the work in them come on no symptom or rooted cause in my body can stand because youve already healed me from before the foundation of the world the same atonement that redeemed me heal me and I am confessing tonight without doubt that I am healed brother brandom said you've got to believe believe it and then confess that he has done it before he can go even go to work on it what what if you're waiting on God and God's waiting on you what if your confessions wrong if God were to open the windows of heaven and let me tell you something some years ago some of us would have thought it impossible to pay off the debt on this property without bleeding people you'd have thought if we would have done that nobody would have had enough left to buy their groceries or pay their bills but let me tell you something when we began to hear brother God used brother gy and when we begin to hear really it's already done sister Flo been saying it for years it's already done she said brother Shelly I wish you'd just put a box back here at the door and and and and just let us believe God to pay all the debt off for this property she said because I believe it's already done yeah and our mind says well you know it'll take a a Month of Sundays for God to do it $10 at a time do you do you wonder if maybe we could have seen things moving a whole lot faster Pastor if if enough of us would have gotten the order of the word now we stand on the other side of that debt and we're building a fellowship hall down there without a loan and you're going to go down it's not fancy yet but I want you to know it's a promise before it got closed in birds are flying around your head and mud tracked and bird dropping and you stand there and you think this will never amount to anything but I want you to know that you've got to realize that there's a promise that's beginning to manifest materialized before your eyes because somebody believed it and somebody confessed that the work was already done and somebody put their hand of the plow to see it begin to come to pass come on that's the order of the word first you believe it then confess that he has done it before he can even go to work on it and brother bom says how many knows that I don't think many people really realize that God may not be even working on your promise just yet because you've failed to see the order of the word you accept it and then call it done done take the ining off of your faith take the future off of your faith and say what the word says it's done every promise in the book is mine it's done believe it accept it believe it confess it he goes on are you still with me when you come to the altar to pray to be forgiven for your sins this is so good it isn't cause you cry it isn't because you confess it's because you believe it sounds too simple doesn't it but this is the believer's inheritance this is Bridal inheritance it's not our crying it's not even our pray our long petitions of telling God how to do it sometimes he prob wants to say stay out of my business just believe that I'm going to do it and call it done and then brother Bram said then we go to praising him and we give him Advanced praise I want you to know there's power in advanced praise I'll show you what he said in just a minute Mary didn't wait on her belly to swell she didn't wait on a physical manifestation that the promise was on the way as soon as she heard the word she believed the word and said let it be done in me then she began to praise the Lord then she began to rejoice and give God praise not because he was going to do it but because he he had done it he had done it let's go on and when you believe stand up [Music] uhoh and testify the prophetic power of a testimony some of us can't testify because we think we have to preach when we get up or we think we've got to tie all the tiny puzzle pieces together so that somebody knows the backstory when somebody says to me I've got to go to the backstory I know I'm going to be there a while that's not the kind of the testimony he's talking about here that has its place and haven't we been encouraged on Tuesday nights when we have taken some testimonies because the enemy will tell you nothing's going on in the body and then all of a sudden people begin to get up uh no I I can't take a phone call although it is a preacher that I haven't heard from in many many years should I just take it he may have something to say to us it's not your life story he's talking about we need that sometime he's talking about believing what the word has said calling it done and then telling somebody before the enemy can move in on your faith now here's what the the the mind says you know know the human mind says well now you better not testify that you're healed because somebody will see you limping and they'll they'll know you're not healed and that will bring a reproach on the Lord and people will think that he doesn't heal has he has he not whispered something stupid like that to you hasn't he told you something like that well I would testify uh I have to be honest I have to be honest my son gave a testimony concerning insurance and the baby coming and all that and and when he made that confession something in my natural mind not my not my faith not my faith but something in my natural mind said oh what if it don't turn out quite like that I caught it I recognized that wasn't me that wasn't my faith that wasn't standing in agreement with his faith and I had to make the confession that he's telling us to make tonight I had to say it is done it is done you know I I spent 10 years of my life traveling around the country some overseas presenting the ministry of brother brandom and the message of the hour to Pentecostal and charismatic people I hope I taught them something they actually taught me a few things right they taught me that you don't have to wait until the fullness of the answer has come to begin to to give God praise they said if it only comes like a little tingle if it only and I don't mean we do this by feeling no no no no we don't do this by feeling that's not what I learned but what I learned was even if it's in its embryonic stage if God if you just begin to see a little I feel a little better well my my blood pressure is lower than it was that's when you jump up and start giving God High Praise that's the kind of warfare praise we're talking about you just start giving him praise that it's done and and one one man said well I have no feeling in my hand and he went up for prayer and there was a little tingle running down one of his fingers and he hadn't felt that in many many many years he stood up his wife pulled him down what are you about to do he said I'm going to testify that I'm Healed she said how do you know you're healed he said well the word said I'm Healed but I feel a little tingle in my finger she said you are not going to stand up and tell this crowd that you know your whole hand and arm has uh is healed and that it's not paralyzed anymore and numb anymore because you felt A tingle in your hand he said watch me watch me he said I want to thank the Lord for healing me my arm and hand was paralyzed and numb and I had no feeling in it and he said tonight when I was prayed for my finger begin to tingle do you know that meeting was over and some Weeks Later the testimony came by email that God had finished that work and I said you know I know his wife don't think that finger tingling is all that silly anymore God gave him that as a little token we wait sometime too long well I need this confirmed by three witnesses that I'm Healed you do well I need to wait at least three weeks to see if the symptoms return church that is not the order of the word we've got to learn to testify of what he has done and praise him for what he has done even though we may not see the manifestation of the fullness of the promise yet if you're with me I want to hear [Music] you it's important it's important he goes on it's not because you confess it isn't because you confess or cry it's because you believe when you come to the altar all right and when you believe and stand up and testify now watch you go outside after you accepted Christ the old crowd says you're no different there's nothing different but you believe you're different well if you go say no I guess I didn't get anything I didn't get it well you just got another trip to the altar coming you've got to understand that everybody's not going to celebrate your Victory somebody's going to ask you how do you know you're healed if somebody in this church ask you how do you know you're healed then that somebody needs another trip to the altar are you in agreement with me don't ask anybody in this house how they know they know because the word said so and they're going to testify that they're healed whether or not they see the full materialization of it or not we're going to celebrate with them if all they have is a tingle in their finger because we're going to believe that what God started he's more than able to finish he's not just the author of your faith but he's the finisher of your faith Hallelujah if you believe that say Amen we got to move on this is page two charity maybe you were right maybe two pages is all I will get to tonight but not likely you said but you believe you're different well if you go say no I guess I didn't get it well you just you just got another trip to the altar coming now in the message Jesus Christ Christ the same yesterday today and forever and we want to greet the saints of God watching this service in Edmonton Alberta Canada we want to give you all of all of you there our love this message was preached in Alberta verse uh paragraph 20 he said if John D Rockefeller would offer me a check tonight to build a new church for a million dollars I wouldn't be afraid to fill it out no sir because I believe John D rockefeller's worth it if I wrote you for a check if I wrote a check for you for a million dollars I'll tell you right now it's not it's not drafted on any of my accounts it's Faith it'd be faith if I did it I wouldn't believe me either but brother brandom said if John D Rockefeller offered you a check for minut he said I wouldn't be afraid to fill it out no sir because I believe John D rockefeller's worth it and if Jesus Christ uhoh we're getting somewhere now if Jesus Christ offered me a check tonight for my sickness that he healed me at calary I'm not afraid to fill it out and hand it in there go testifying that God has healed me because I know that the one that the check is drawn on can back it up now that's where we are tonight that's where we are tonight he said no matter what the results is I believe Jesus told the truth see that's where it comes from it's what you believe it's what you believe it's what you believe your attitude I want to see you your attitude towards Jesus no wonder some people don't speak Faith they don't trust that the check is any good you've got to believe that it's good you've got to believe that he's the same yesterday and today and forever you've come too late I know they're cessationists I told you recently that the cessationist movement is growing in the world and people that have never believed that these things have come to an end now believe that he only healed in the days of the early Apostles because of the of the atmosphere of the day and they had to have the supernatural to get the church established well I want you to know something since our God does not have the nature of starting off with the bang and dwindling down until he Fizzles out at the end I'm going to take him at his word that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and today and forever and I'm not going to be a cessationist and I'm not going to believe that he doesn't heal anymore and I'm not going to believe that he doesn't move anymore and I'm going to believe that there is a New Testament Church rising up and that Prophet said that if this Vine ever puts forth another Branch it'll be a starchy emotionless oppressed people well that's what I see a lot so quiet till the only thing you can hear is a spider run across the carpet it's not about noise I'm not saying it's about noise but I want you to know there's something wrong with you if you can sit in the spirit of God moving all around you and you never feel compelled to raise up your hands and say Lord I Thank you that I'm alive I thank you that the very breath that's in my lungs is because of you come on you don't have to jump around I'm a jumper I I'm just obnoxious you don't have to be like me but what you can't do is be so dead dry that you don't believe so that when crisis strikes or tragedy strikes you've got to call on somebody else to get a hold of God for you instead of getting hold of him for yourself the way to stay stay sure of that is to keep all the dead cats off the line I want you to call me I want you to text me I want to pray with you but I want you to know there may be a time that you can't get me and you can use that time oh they said Benjamin was singing The Royal telephone not too long ago and somebody said some one streamer watching not a not a Believer this message said well that's about the oldest dustiest song I've ever heard and it's just about irrelevant and I can't believe that people today would say what do you mean Central's never busy always on the line you can talk to Jesus almost any time is a royal service free for one and all when you get in trouble give this Royal line of call telephone to Glory oh what Joy Divine I can feel oh feel I can feel the current moving on the line built by God the Father for his loved and owned you can talk to Jesus on this Royal telephone you can call him faster than you can text somebody else the answer is on the way because he said it was now let me stay with my let me stay with my thought it's your attitude towards Jesus he said look at Mark 11:24 that was the second verse we read whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it that's the order of the word now that's paragraph 21 that's the order of the word now now believe now you receive it it shall be given unto you is that right he said you shall have whatever you've asked for if you believe it and now if Jesus paid for it there why I believe it I accept it believe it and go witnessing testifying confessing that it is already done there's the ABCs right there in Matthew 2122 give me a few more moments I'm watching Matthew 21:22 and all things I got to get off page two so they won't bother me about it Matthew 21:22 and all things whatsoever you shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive John 14:14 if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it I need some help John 15:7 if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will are you remembering any Divine promises that you've been holding on to God for and you've been waiting on God and maybe tonight you find out that God's been waiting on you it's time to meet in the middle it's time to call the Divine standstill off it's time to follow the order of the word we accept that it's true that it's right we believe in our heart with faith and we call it we confess it we testify of it that it's done in a message the angel of God he said in the best that I know how to do Christian friend is to give out these cards remember the prayer cards that they gave out because the crowds were there and then cards were numbered and under inspiration they would call out the numbers and and the people would come and line up in the in the num in the line and the prayer line and and people would be healed and and so forth he said well well that's the that's the best I I can do is to give out these cards but friends did you notice there's more people gets healed out there without cards then there is healed here with the card see there's more you don't need the card why he's shutting his own healing line down almost so you don't have to come at 2 o'clock in the afternoon to get in by 7 because he's telling you that even if you don't have a card you've got the same access that's somebody who holds a card has somebody said oh if brother Brandon was just alive today oh if brother Brandon was just here today oh if Paul was just here today we could get our needs met if that's your mentality no wonder no wonder you're not seeing God move in your life he's not a yesteryear god he's a today God too he was God then he is God now he will be God throughout eternity isn't that the truth you don't need the card the card's just merely to keep you lined up oh my goodness did you know people were trying to sell prayer cards really they tried to sell them there were people that that went home deflated because they didn't get a prayer card that's one of the reasons why brother brandom I've actually met people through the years that didn't get a prayer card and went home left the service so disappointed that they didn't get a prayer card what if it would have been in 51 when he said this you don't need a prayer card and that's not the only time he said it how many times are we listening to into a prayer line he said what's that the pillar of fire has left the platform the pastor of the king of kings assembly which is Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada which is the Canadian version of the Assemblies of God pastor Wayne hillon who pastors the King of Kings assembly in Jerusalem Israel yeah told me out of his own mouth that that his mother was in a meeting with brother brandham and couldn't get a prayer card wow and he know the name of the tape and everything he came to a presentation that we did at a conference there in Jerusalem and he said I don't mind I mentioned I said you know there's some people that that would be offended if I mention The Healing Ministry of brother R but I'm going to do it anyway and after after the service they took us all to dinner and and pastor Wayne Hilson said H I'm not I'm not embarrassed I'm not ashamed he said I'm a product he said I'm a prodct of that miracle ministry I said well tell me how that is well my mother and dad my dad pastored an Assembly of God Church in the states and they were in several of brother bram's meetings my mom was Barren couldn't have children they'd been married a number of years and the doctors told them there was no hope there was no hope that that that per perhaps even both of them had something wrong with them and they wouldn't be able to have a baby but they went to the meeting that night my mom so disappointed that she didn't have a prayer card but she sat there on the seat and began to pray Lord you are the same back [Music] here woo she didn't have all the word you've got and she believed she said you're the same God back here at the back door that you are up there on the platform she said if I have found favor in your sight God pass by me and brother Brandon said what's that the pillar of fire has left the platform and it's hanging there on the in the back corner back right hand corner of the church is hanging over a woman's head Mrs hilon God is healing you tonight and he's giving you new a new there there's a creative sort of thing happening I'm paraphrasing now and God is going to Grant you the desire of your heart and he will run with the word my mama went home I I ought not to tell this this is too private I'm I'm going to get out of the pullit to tell this shut your children's ears he said Steve my mama went home and my daddy told me later my mama had never been so fresh is that offensive if it is I'm going to say it again he said my dad told me my mom had never been so frisky as for the few days after that meeting oh my can you get over your embarrassment and your offense long enough to do don't you see don't you see that that is the order of of the word she put God to the test here we've been married all these years and no hope and the doctor said no reason to hope that there perhap they knew the mother had a big issue and perhaps even the father had an issue and they had almost given up hope but not not her she said you're the same God I got to go through it again somebody needs to hear this you're the same God back here as you are up on that platform woo on Mother's Day I preached a message about a mother's Faith a real mother's faith that can ground an airplane here was a real woman's faith not yet a mother but already had a mother's heart that said God if you do it up there you can do it right back here for me and went home and said you know honey you're looking mighty handsome tonight and so forth and Etc I need a little water my children will blush and they'll fuss later for me say that what else would you do but to position yourself oh my my I wish somebody could hear that he said here I am and God didn't give me a pull pit in Alberta Canada or Toronto he said God gave me the most wonderful coveted pullit in all the world he called me to his holy city and let me pray for for Jews and Gentiles and Internationals from all over the world and watch them receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost now you can say anything you want to because I know that some people believe that if you don't go to a message Church you couldn't have any truth at all but I certainly know better than that and don't you believe I believe that God put that man in that position for such a time as this and used used a mama's faith and and what did Brother brandom have to do with it this is the thing that gets me kind of perturbed yeah if brother brandom could do all these things in his day then we would be really sorrowful today because he's not here but since he wasn't the one doing these things anyway he said I'm I'm just trying to build your faith hello I'm just trying to build your faith you know I'm waiting on something there is Brother Cleveland told me and brother Wes confirmed he brother brandom is down in in mon Georgia they've moved out of the Coliseum they're out in the ball field there are Miracles that have been taking place all week long yeah God began to move in that room and in that Auditorium in that Coliseum there was a child there that hadn't walked came with a shoe box ready to receive a miracle anybody got a shoe box anybody willing to go home and kiss your husband on the cheek anybody willing to take God at his word you don't need a prayer card you just need to have faith believe him with all your heart I'm I'm going to come back to that accept him no matter what happens if you don't have to I I if you excuse me no matter what happens it don't have to happen right now this is what's wrong with us if it don't happen right now we think oh just as I thought I didn't get anything that's not the way it works Le let's go on when it happens it doesn't happen in your crippled arm in your crippled leg so much or in your bad heart or the cancer it happens here in your heart you believe it you hold it I'm going to let you read the rest does that sound Hocus Pocus to you does does that sound does that sound weird to you does that sound new age to you sounds like Bible days are here again to me you believe it you hold on to it take your shoe box with you brother brandham has prayed for so many in the prayer lines and he's released healing all over the building and he's so worn out that brother Billy Paul comes and Taps him on the on the side and says daddy that's enough we you've got to go you've got to reserve your strength for the rest of the meeting brother Billy Paul starts backing up and and he's backing brother brandom up like this pulling him like this toward the edge of the stage where he's going to spin him around and help him get down because his body was so physically drained and so physically weak from the faith pull of the people because people were pulling on him some were were pulling on him instead of pulling on God but there was a a father I believe and a child and I'm I'm sorry to tell you that I don't remember if it was a boy or a girl but I'm thinking that it was a girl please forgive me I I think it was a girl brother Gerald Cleveland there brother brother West in the same meetings sister West's dad sponsored the meeting brother Stucky brother brandom's about to go off the platform and all of a sudden he stiffens up and he says wait a minute Paul there's one more you might say that that little child and dad was pulling on brother brandom I believe that that individual was pulling on the Lord and the Lord stopped his Prophet I believe that black mamy wasn't calling on on Elijah she was calling on the god of Elijah come on I believe that dad and his little girl I believe it was were calling on the Lord and he said just one more he said I just saw that little child there because they had been inching their way all the time closer and closer and closer to the front and brother brandham caught them it wasn't his eye that caught them it was the faith that they had in God that caught them and he said just one more Paul he straightened right up and he put his arm up in the air and he said to before he did he said to the little little boy to the dad is that your Sho is that your shoes there in that box and they witnessed that indeed it was can you imagine crippled feet couldn't wear shoes but went to church prepared to wear shoes that's Faith that's the kind of faith we have to have that's the order of the word well I just saw that little child running all over this building healed right that's what he said and he rared up and he put his hand in the air and he said Satan turn her loose in the name of Jesus Christ didn't need a vision didn't need an interview didn't need a dip seven times in the muddy Jordan Faith had touched God God had moved on the prophet that little child jumped up and didn't wait on her shoes ran barefooted across that Auditorium and brother Cleveland said brother Shelly he told me multiple time did you ever meet Brother Cleveland brother Templeton you met sister Delane brother Gerald is the one who witnessed to me tears every time he told it running down his face he said brother Shelly we were there I think they had a wire I think he was there with a wire recorder the wax discs I believe that was about the time that they were still using using the wax disc and he had borrowed one so he could get close to the front he said I didn't know very much about running it but I needed to be close and he said I was so close that when that Prophet spoke that word in the name of the Lord Satan turn him loose in the name of Jesus Christ he said brother Shelly tears running down his face my children have heard him tell it he said I heard some saw but I heard those bones I was close enough to hear those bones popping and snapping as God took those Twisted mangled feet and made that child a new pair went home wearing the shoes but didn't need them to receive the [Music] miracle he's the same God if you think he's finished if you think that's over if you think that this message came to just tell you what God was sir you are so sadly mistaken he said let let's finish this he said it it's not your leg so much your it happens here in your heart you believe it you hold it and it materializes 47 he said every seed I got to hurry 8 8:00 woo said um every seed will bring forth of its kind is that right wheat will bring forth wheat barley barley corn corn is that right he said well Jesus said the word of God was a seed isn't that right Jesus said the word of God was a seed now Mark 11:24 is that a seed then he's asking if the word of God is a seed is Mark 11:24 a seed how many of you know it is it said therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them isn't that a seed I think that's a seed Jesus said whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe you receive it and you shall have it now the order of the scripture believe now you receive it present tense in the future it'll be given to you now does anybody believe God can do something instantaneously oh oh I heard someone try to define the difference in a miracle and a healing don't do that for me somebody said if it's instant it's a miracle if it's Progressive it's a healing oh no no no no no I don't know if that's right or not that doesn't always just witness with me I've seen God take his time with a miracle a miracle is something Supernatural that defies the laws of nature that baffles the baffler shocks the doctor and yet brother brandom said said the greatest Miracle is not the healing of the body in the first place it's the salvation of the soul in that Redemption is the greatest Miracle that's ever taken so I'm not going to try to define the difference between a healing and a miracle but do you still believe God can do instantaneous things you still believe that in some cases suddenly can mean suddenly and now can mean now anybody give up on now meaning now and suddenly meaning suddenly does anybody in here know that this thing can turn on a dime and what you've been begging God waiting on God to do if that inspiration if that little button of light in you if inspiration will strike that seed word in you and you begin to say it's done I'm through weeping I'm through grieving I'm through ringing my hands I'm going to take the Bible order the order of the word I'm going to well yeah but you know we believed we believed we believed for brothers we beli for sisters you cannot let that is God Sovereign I got to say this I'm going to try to hush thank you brother I believe I will um we still hear Believers saying stupid things it's that old hospital that's a good place to go die if they'd been in a better Hospital they'd have lived it's that old medicine they put him on F have put on put him on a better medicine if they' just had a better doctor I want to tell you something either God's Sovereign or not and if God is calling your loved one's home we can stand on our heads and roll in the floor and beg and grieve and cry how do you know preacher because I've done it yes sir I have begged God sir I didn't want my granny to die she was too young to leave here in my mind I begged God I I I didn't follow the Bible order I begged God I I pleaded with God I promised God everything that I could think of to promise him if he would just heal my big mama and not take her for at this time and and and God don't you know that that that God would have loved to have given me my request Lord but he had a sovereign Bland he was sending me to Columbus Georgia he had a sovereign plan he knew that a Bible order had come to my grandmother's life and yet if she would have lived for many years that that pull would have been on her she would have struggled she spent over 40 years in Ministry when the word came Jonathan's grandparents and my grand parents were close friends my granny preached the valley every church every congregational Holiness Church every emanu Holiness Church she preached meetings there there are people in the valley right now alive healed in Granny's meetings and serving God saved in Granny's meetings but when the order of the word came she said well you mean I've done that all these years and it wasn't my responsibility yes ma'am then I'll never do it again his grandparents saw the message of the Hour his dad and they went to they went to on the wings of a snow white dove in shreport Louisiana and they were close they supported my granny's Ministry wherever she was preaching they went but the message came and when God revealed to them the order of the word they had to pull away but I would never believe you could never convince me that that that grandmother Hollis didn't keep praying for her friend Lord you know Sister Mildred sincere before you I want you to show her the way I want you to reveal yourself to her come on and I know that Jonathan's dad did because as soon as I had heard the word he come down to my place with not with Steve but he come with a big big uh anyway he came down to my Granny's house and began to tell talk to her and he began to tell her sister Shelly all these years we prayed for you and God didn't forget you and God has revealed himself to you let me tell you something that was many years after they were gone prayer means something they didn't see the Fulfillment of the prayer they prayed the prayer they believed it perhaps they left here calling it done but it wasn't until a appointed time so all my praying to keep granny here was not in the Sovereign Mind Of God so it wasn't a better cancer treatment and it's not a better doctor come on and it's not a better hospital and it's not a hack nurse it's a sovereignty of God but don't you dare let the fact that God call some of his people out of here to spare them oh I've asked God I've asked the Lord why why born now why in this season why didn't you let me be born in another day I I wasn't made for this at this time I wasn't it grates on my nerves and Grieves me I see what's happening in the church in the believing church and how they've gone back to pick up the things they condemned 25 and 30 years ago and I would I think Lord God why wasn't I born in another day but God is Sovereign he puts you right where he wants you for such a time as the one appointed for you and just because somebody you loved God chose to take them home don't you let that stop your faith I've had people say to me but it's the same kind of cancer so what well it's the same doctor so what well they're laying hopeless in the same hospital so what we're going to take God at his word we're going to believe he said that's the order of the word now believe now you receive it it shall be given is that right I believe it I accept it believe it and go and go what testifying that's 21 and go testifying did I go back what' I do angel of God oh well I was just giving you that quote again because I thought you might need need it you know see see he said present tense in the future will be given to you what your the things you desire if you pray believe you receive them and it shall be given on you see you shall receive it in the future just accept it believe it and what stay with it water it oh my pour some water on the promise believe it it'll come to pass God's under let me make sure we're in the right place isn't he God's under God doesn't need you pounding The Altar and obligating him he's obligated himself when you approach God don't you give him your track record you don't have to say now I've been faithful to church and I barely miss a Tuesday night and I and I pay my time oh I've tried all that I've never heard him laugh but I wonder if he's ever laughed at me what do you mean reciting your pedigree or something here that's not what I'm looking for that's God wants me to be faithful to his house God wants me to pay my tithe but the order of the word is not what I what I do how I perform what my behavior is I've got to believe it I've got to confess it I've got to testify of it I've got to say it is done and it shall be musicians are coming I'm I'm on page three we go and have a little fellowship and maybe in August we'll have a somebody else that can preach I don't have to preach but I was ready to well I noticed you was out here early yeah I I get out here as early as I can I know what church order said but I don't wait until I get here to get my sermon or or to get myself ready I start doing that quite early come on because when I get here I want to worship amen I've heard little little story you know little martyr things and people say oh oh I'd really love I would just so much love to be out there but I've got to I got to do what the prophet said and keep the church order and so forth listen I was in a meeting in Ryan Oak Virginia one time and uh your pastor's father brother Henry green and brother Dan daisley had driven from rutherton to Rowan Oak Virginia to hear me preach and they did travel and I preached for them many times and in those days just a kid and they traveled as often as they could to encourage me did you did you know brother Henry green you probably didn't ever meet him you're just young I I probably got socks in my drawer older than you brother but anyway uh they came in that night I won't say who the pastor is he might still be as dry now as he is he might be on I don't know but we were having a wonderful meeting but he expressly said to me now I know you got a little Pentecostal flare and he said now you'll settle down after you've been in the message a few years you you'll get all that taken care of Joshua you recently rode with him in a golf cart in Virginia but anyway he says but I I need you to I need you to stay and he said when it's time for you to come out there will be a red light bulb that'll come on there in the office and it's it's imperative for you to stay back there until that red light comes on and then you come out I said yes sir but I didn't mean it you know that's just a little much for me them folks got to sing and that was when they really worshiped and sung I'm telling you they got got to singing and the floors got to rattling they got to having themselves a good time and I was miserable I wanted to be right in the minute I didn't think that red light bulb would ever come on and brother Henry green I I know more had come to the pull pit than he stood up and prophesied over my life boy what would they do with that publicly in that room without a without a room and without three judges and so forth he prophesied over my life many of things that have certainly come to pass at the end of that service it seems to me like the pastor recognized them to to give a little testimony or a little greeting and pray over the service he specified to brother Henry Green from your seat and brother Henry green began to you know thank God for the service and the preaching and the moving of the spirit and this is just life and he said he said I I I had a vision I I saw something in my mind's eye he said I'm not going to blame the Lord for it but he said I was trying to imagine brother Shelly stuck in that office back there behind that door he said I've preached here before and he said I I know about the red light the whole church sitting there he said and and he said to be honest with you I wanted to scream out here comes brother Shelly out of shoot number nine why because he knew that I wanted to be in that atmosphere I read today where the Prophet said atmosphere is everything it's everything Hallelujah you you can take a chicken egg and put it under a hound dog Daddy Bosworth said and it'll hatch it's not the mother it's the atmosphere it's not what laid the egg oh my let's build an atmosphere here before we go home let's come tomorrow I want to see you let me tell you something I've been waiting with you I've known some of you since the early 90s I've been waiting with you for some of those promises I want to see them come to pass in your life I want to be here I want to be alive to see you hold your promise in your arms I I like Simeon and Anna I don't want to die until I've seen the Lord's salvation manifested in your life with a Divine promise that has materialized I I want to be around to see that so I'm not preaching this to judge you or condemn you I'm preaching this to inspire you we've got to raise our expectations a little higher this is this is the last quotation and tomorrow I'm going to contrast the difference between Zacharias and Mary same theme in paragraph 46 he said Now quickly before the time gets away I I'll put it in my own words see a and I was quoting his words he said fear not for I am sent from the presence of God tell you that you're a peculiar birth and Life to indicate that you're to take a gift of Divine Healing to the peoples of the world does anybody recognize that that's the Angel's commission to brother brandham someone said how do you know that happened because the the signs and the Miracles and the Wonders and the manifestations of it followed the ministry that's how I know and that's why I'm not falling off the wagon because we don't know how many people fell off the bridge and we think there might be another reason for the cloud and we're not sure if everything was just like it was supposed to be I want you to know I'm not following this message because brother brandom had a gift of divine recall I'm following this truth because it lines up with the word and I not only know the Miracles I've not only sat down with the Miracles I've not only heard the testimony of the Miracles I've seen God continuing to honor this word by performing Miracles among us even now he he is the same you said fear not you be sincere when you pray and get the people to believe you nothing shall stand before your prayer not even to cancer and listen to what brother Brandon throws in right in the middle of that now watch the order what order is he talking about I assume he's referring back to the order of the Bible the order of the scripture he calls it he said God sent the gift nearly 40 years about 40 years ago it's been in the world ever since this pardoning he calls it and now the thing I was to do was to pray for the sick and be sincere when I prayed and nothing would stand before the prayer I want you to hear what the commission said if you can get the people to believe you see the order now that angel didn't say if you can get the people to believe in you it said if you can get the people to believe you what were they to believe they were to believe the word and the word said ask anything come on this was not building a following for himself oh no no no no no he had preached the word of faith at night he was going to preach the word of faith that night he's talking about believing the word that comes forth he said see the order now see the thing of it is the thing is to get the people to believe that this is the truth what the the word that was preached that night the message that God was delivering to the people that is what he was told get the PE if you can get the people to believe and I said to the angel now you got that part have you the gift is not to the discernment listen the gift is to pray for the sick and get them to believe you you get what I mean nothing shall stand before the prayer not even the cancer that's just to pray for the sick and tell them he's coming to something said now I'm going to pray for you you believe I believe with all my heart and lay hands over on them and pray for them and ask the blessing in the name of the Lord Jesus and pass them on I know we hear the Visions I know we hear the the discernment I know we have the testimony like he said to Sister West your back trouble go your way way believing your back troubles left you or to other stories that we know sister yordis who has come here from Norway and giving you her testimony where God performs such miraculous things but I want you to know there were many people that he just prayed over them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ receive your believe believe no vision no discernment no doctor's names no addresses nothing just go believing do you understand it it wasn't everybody didn't need to have the vision everybody didn't have to the gift didn't have to operate for everybody he said they're supposed to go away rejoicing believing they're going to get well you see some wouldn't have had the faith had God not called their doctor's name God was helping people I want you to know God was merciful why because that was an hour that the son of man had risen with healing in his wings God was performing his word by getting the people's Faith where it needed to be but everybody didn't need uh to know what was in their purse to believe so some people they just pronounce the blessing on they're supposed to go away rejoicing believing they're going to get well the supposed to believe they're going to walk the blind supposed to believe they're going to see I want you to understand that the responsibility for the miracle was never on brother brandom shoulder except for the fact that it was his responsibility to help the people believe it was their responsibility to believe and if he just passed them on through the line it was their responsibility to go rejoicing sister West had nursed that bad back and she'd sat on a pillow and and her tailbone was so injured and and brother Wes wasn't going to miss a meeting so he puts her in the car and hauls her to Jeffersonville from from uh I guess I guess Huntsville then I don't guess I were living in making then and she's sitting on the donut in so much pain don't diminish that pain I found it I found the bottom of some slick steps in Canada I never picked up a suitcase for years that I didn't remember that pain it came back lifting a suitcase she was in awful shape here she goes up there she said brother Shelly I couldn't believe I couldn't believe Benny was almost almost dragging me to go but she said I wanted I wanted to go I I mean I really wanted to but I just was in so much pain and he said go your way she comes up there go your way your back troubles left you I don't even think he touched her she said I couldn't have helped but believe she said there was such a presence that wasn't brother brandom's presence oh no that was the Lord's presence that's why brother brand was such a a humble and non-assuming sort of fell it wasn't his personality that caused people to believe oh no I know leaders that sat in those meetings and when brother brandham came out and and looked down over the microphone and said good evening friends I know believers who said that was the most amazing statement they'd ever heard in their life good evening friends I know other church leaders who said what am I doing here who is this who what are we going to hear tonight from this little bashful fellow that's what Tommy osbor said what what what are we going to hear from this little bashful fellow but he said then in a moment I had a vision I saw the Lord Jesus standing on the corner of the stage and I watched him walk across that stage and step into that little gentleman and he said then I understood the authority of the ministry when he started talking see that was to keep the focus on the Lord the angel of the Lord and not the servant amen sister Wes said it was like clouds brother shell she said I thought I was walking out through the clouds I thought I had left the auditorium and every step I made it was like I was getting higher and higher and higher I said how was your back she said my back trouble was gone brother brandom didn't heal her go your way what believing that atmosphere was so powerful she she had to believe she could feel it it was tangible and she just I I I I I believe I I I take it and never suffered in that way again the same way that God blessed them with children when brother brandom told them when you have children raise them in church he didn't say thus sayith the Lord You're going to have one he just said when you have them it takes Faith some some time to KN knit a booty remember a virgin shall conceive and and somebody some little virgin girl maidens for Generations took out their kneading nles excuse me knitting I I may say something terrible here knitting needles and began to knit booties believing for the possibility that I might be one of them that's the kind of faith I like amen well what if you're not well what if you are bring your shoes what if you what if you don't need them what if you do you make up your mind tonight I want you to stand thank you so much you you have you you certainly have been wonderful and gracious and I know this isn't what you were expecting on Saturday night fellowship meeting but I couldn't help it I couldn't got away from this if I have wanted to I want the Bible order of things I I want to receive the Divine promise of God in manifestation and materialization in my life and I know there's a Bible order I got to believe and I've got to call it done I've got to confess it and then I have to testify I'm Healed so far I've got a tingle in my finger but I'm I'm believing that the full manifestation of the healing is mine somebody said well don't everybody around this truth believe such a thing as that I don't know folks I don't know we've got more pills in our purses and I I I'm not condemning anybody I take a medication I'm not condemning anybody I just want you to know that there was a time that people who had less truth than you do and I do didn't depend on the prescription they depended on the Bible one they believe that God would I don't think that it's wise to be foolish but I think it's wise to have faith I think sometimes we have to believe well brother Brandon even told him he said you know you you see what your doctor said you believe you're healed you go back and tell your doctor let him watch let him watch he even told some people sometime just you know maybe wean yourself a little bit be careful but but your confession is I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed so don't you go out of here and say well he said don't take a uh uh uh appeal I didn't say such a thing as that but I'm telling you we ought to be that New Testament Church ought to be rising up and I know that that Authority and and faith is in The Believer because of the word and I know we ought to be speaking arthritis right out of the house and somebody said well you know you just get old you're going to have do you do you have to is that a is that a that sounds like some of these sad parents who who say things like your children have to go out out in the world so they can appreciate what it means to serve the Lord the spirit of stupid has got on somebody that's what's wrong your children don't have to go out in the world and taste what Satan's got to offer to have a testimony they can get one tonight that'll keep them when he filled me with the Holy Ghost at seven years old he took the desire before I ever had a chance to feel it that God is able to do do the same for these young people tonight make them so sick I pray that when some of you tune your dial to Who's Cheating Who and who's being true I hope that song makes you so nauseated that you say I'll never feed my spiritual man on that [Music] garbage you need to just linger with him a little bit yes sir let God change your desire he'll change your desire if you'll let him thank you I was thinking that might be a little rough just stretch a little bit you've been sitting it's 8:30 pastor's got to get up in the morning and feed his congregation you've worked all week had babies and lost gallbladders and I don't know what all else has happened around here I just loved an Christine's post what I love more than that was fact she was up here praising the Lord tonight a little bit lighter God is so good I know you're tired and and you just hardly feel like grunting in faith but I want you to do this before we leave Brother David man is here he's sitting out there in the he's not out there because he's mad at me he wanted me to know he wasn't upset with worship he's been sitting out there during worship but sometimes the whole service is loud here my phone tells me all the time you you say in this atmosphere 20 minutes you you could suffer hearing loss but he has a tumor in his ear and he had a bad report this week it's not cancerous but it's growing and they're going to do an MRI to see what what it's if it's pressing and anyway the the the doctor was kind of backing out of surgery well I don't know too much about these things but seemed to me like you can't just leave the thing there to grow so that would be kind of a discouraging report no wonder he reached out and said to Benjamin can we sing this this weekend whose report will you believe oh that's like bringing your shoe box oh somebody ought to see Brother David man knitting booties positioning himself God can do [Applause] that I had a growth on the back of my neck one time and I went to we were taking the young people to byc and I was going to preach that year we stopped off at brother Bill yon's and there was a little brother there that uh had come out of the big church and was at brother Bill's there and he had a little gift in his life and and the collar of my shirt covered up that that growth on the back of my neck it was kind of tender it hadn't been giving me trouble but all of a sudden it started getting tender his name was brother Hutchins I believe maybe Hutchin son I can't remember but anyway the collar covered it up there's no way he could have seen it uh he had kind of been put out of the church because he had a gift in his life he was an old man he had no ministerial ambition you know he wasn't trying to build a following he was just trying to obey God he walked up to me JT padet was preaching that night and we were we passing through to pick up kids to fill up the van for camp and that little brother walked up to me and lay his hand on the back of my neck and and that tumor was under his hand and he cursed it in the name of Jesus Christ and you know what it went he's the same when I was traveling under the big tent I saw gers disappear I saw cancerous tumors fall off of people's faces come on I've seen some things I'm not taking somebody else's testimony or you believe this because you heard it on a tapable read in the book no I've seen that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the Lord can touch that tumor and cause it to disappear if he chooses to be a witness to that doctor he can just shrink it enough so that that he'll say well I don't know what shrinking but and and now it's going the other direction it was getting larger now it's getting smaller God knows exactly what he's doing I don't want to go through this again except you you know the testimony we gave you Sunday my daughter-in-law ended up in the in a hospital with the C-section when she was planning to have a home birth couldn't understand why things were so difficult and the doctor tells them and then comes out and tells the family somebody was looking out for you all today when we took that baby the cord was wrapped around its neck three times and if if she would
