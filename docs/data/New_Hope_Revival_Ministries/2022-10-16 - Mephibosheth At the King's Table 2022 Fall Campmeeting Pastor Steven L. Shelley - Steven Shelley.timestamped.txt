[1:20:21] born and they have been able to
[1:20:23] stabilize her but but she it's a boy
[1:20:26] excuse me it's a boy isn't it it's a boy
[1:20:28] the reason I said a girl is because the
[1:20:31] other the this young man's brother's
[1:20:34] little girl has been struggling in the
[1:20:37] hospital also a little baby girl but uh
[1:20:41] this is the daughter of Ben and Megan
[1:20:45] McGrady and that is brother Lindsay
[1:20:48] McGrady's
[1:20:49] son and his wife and brother Avery and
[1:20:53] Sister Janet Rourke and then on the
[1:20:56] other side of the family are the our
[1:20:57] Bros that we have all known for so many
[1:21:00] years and this little child needs a
[1:21:04] miracle to survive they've already been
[1:21:06] able to stabilize the little fellow and
[1:21:09] we're just asking the Lord wouldn't it
[1:21:11] be amazing there are so many people now
[1:21:14] that know of the condition of that
[1:21:15] little boy that if God would just come
[1:21:18] in and and he needs a creative Miracle
[1:21:22] you know he doesn't just need a touch
[1:21:23] he's got to have a creative Miracle but
[1:21:27] I know a God that's creative
[1:21:30] oh yes we preached last night about God
[1:21:33] creating frogs if God can create frogs
[1:21:37] he can create organs again
[1:21:39] and he can cause little club feet
[1:21:43] the little child has club feet I want
[1:21:45] you to know that's nothing hey that's
[1:21:48] absolutely nothing for the god that we
[1:21:50] serve
[1:21:52] and to the last to the last while of
[1:21:55] brother Perry Green's life
[1:21:57] he told the testimony over and over and
[1:22:01] over again you may be seated a moment he
[1:22:04] told it over and over again
[1:22:07] we helped to host him in Mobile Alabama
[1:22:11] some years ago
[1:22:13] at a large Gathering of Pentecostals and
[1:22:15] charismatics and he was invited there to
[1:22:18] give testimony of the ministry of
[1:22:20] brother William Branham
[1:22:22] and I wrote in the in the elevator with
[1:22:25] him and I was with him many times in
[1:22:28] many places
[1:22:29] and every time he saw a little child
[1:22:33] seemed like especially if the little
[1:22:35] fellow didn't have on a shoe or sock
[1:22:38] brother green was of another generation
[1:22:41] and he didn't realize that everybody
[1:22:44] don't want their baby touched
[1:22:47] you know there are people that don't
[1:22:48] want their baby touched
[1:22:50] you almost better keep them away from us
[1:22:52] then
[1:22:53] because we like to touch them
[1:22:56] brother green he would just reach out I
[1:22:58] was riding an elevator with him he'd
[1:22:59] just reach out and take a hold of a
[1:23:01] stranger's Little Foot
[1:23:02] strange little babies and just start
[1:23:04] rubbing his foot and boy that at one
[1:23:07] time it embarrassed me just a little bit
[1:23:10] and I thought I hope he's going to tell
[1:23:11] him why he's rubbing that little baby's
[1:23:13] foot and about that time he reared back
[1:23:16] in that big old voice and he said you
[1:23:18] probably wonder why I'm rubbing your
[1:23:20] little baby's foot he said every time I
[1:23:21] see a little naked foot it reminds me of
[1:23:24] the time that right before my eyes I saw
[1:23:28] a little club feet that were all
[1:23:31] malformed and and twisted and brother
[1:23:34] Branham prayed for this little child I
[1:23:36] saw it with my own eyes I watched those
[1:23:38] little feet begin to unfold like a rose
[1:23:41] petal like a rosebud and little toes
[1:23:44] begin to form where there had been
[1:23:46] nothing there little bones begin to come
[1:23:48] in and I heard the noise I want you to
[1:23:51] know he had the full attention of this
[1:23:53] couple that were strangers to him if God
[1:23:57] did it then don't you know that God is
[1:24:01] able to do it now
[1:24:04] you know some of you are looking at me
[1:24:06] really funny but I want you to know that
[1:24:08] I believe that in the last move of God
[1:24:11] for the bride
[1:24:14] you see there have been revivals
[1:24:16] everywhere brother Branham said here and
[1:24:18] there denominational this and and and
[1:24:21] Full Gospel business means that but he
[1:24:24] said the bride has never had a Revival
[1:24:27] yet
[1:24:29] and he began to speak to us about a
[1:24:32] quick short work a time that the
[1:24:34] manifested sons of God quick short
[1:24:37] not a long period of time but just a
[1:24:40] short period of time right at the end
[1:24:42] where God meant aren't we supposed to be
[1:24:46] praying
[1:24:47] whoa
[1:24:48] where God manifests himself in such a
[1:24:51] profound way by the power of the
[1:24:53] creative spoken word and the sons of God
[1:24:56] begin to manifest and they speak with
[1:24:59] authority and they they change the
[1:25:01] weather pattern
[1:25:03] and they raised the Dead
[1:25:06] and they caused blind eyes to be opened
[1:25:09] and deaf ears to be unstuck your faith
[1:25:12] may not be for that but mine is
[1:25:15] I want you to know I don't serve a God
[1:25:17] who Fizzles out in the end
[1:25:22] if that's your theology we don't share
[1:25:24] an opinion on theology because I don't
[1:25:27] believe it's in the nature of God to
[1:25:30] start outstanding and powerful and
[1:25:32] Brilliant and glorious and then shriek
[1:25:35] himself so that there's barely anybody
[1:25:37] with any Victory when the Rapture comes
[1:25:41] I believe there's there is a company of
[1:25:44] sons of God in the bride of Christ that
[1:25:48] are being prepared all over the world in
[1:25:50] such an hour as this you may not see
[1:25:53] them you may not know where to find them
[1:25:55] but I'm telling you for they exist
[1:25:59] yeah
[1:26:00] we have allowed our doubt to choke our
[1:26:03] faith and we need to come to a place I
[1:26:07] don't know that what God is going to do
[1:26:10] but I know what he's able to do
[1:26:12] okay
[1:26:14] oh King
[1:26:16] we just got to tell you
[1:26:19] we're not sure exactly how God's gonna
[1:26:21] do this
[1:26:24] we just know we can
[1:26:27] we just know he's able and one way or
[1:26:30] another he's going to save and deliver
[1:26:31] so don't you worry about it it'll be all
[1:26:34] right now how many of you believe God
[1:26:36] can touch that child already has already
[1:26:39] has
[1:26:40] already has God can touch that little
[1:26:43] baby boy what is the name my King Josiah
[1:26:47] Matthew God's able to touch that little
[1:26:50] boy and give that family a miracle and I
[1:26:53] want us to pray and I love all the
[1:26:56] children here and uh they they say I
[1:26:59] have a favorite and I I'm not going to
[1:27:02] admit to that publicly in front of
[1:27:04] everybody because I love them all but
[1:27:06] there's a little special boy one of
[1:27:08] these days I'll tell you why I'm not
[1:27:09] trying to make it spiritual it is
[1:27:11] spiritual one of these days I'll tell
[1:27:13] you why I have that kind of a connection
[1:27:16] with him something the Lord told me when
[1:27:18] he was being born and and he is dear to
[1:27:21] me and he was running just a few moments
[1:27:23] ago a temperature of 105.
[1:27:26] and they're they're working to get him
[1:27:28] some help and I want the Lord to touch
[1:27:31] little Ezekiel tonight I know that God
[1:27:33] is able so let's go ahead and stand
[1:27:35] let's take both needs to the Lord let's
[1:27:38] let our faith turn loose right now and
[1:27:41] while we're praying we'll pray that the
[1:27:44] word will come forth tonight and
[1:27:46] accomplish all that it is sent forth to
[1:27:48] do that your tiredness will leave you
[1:27:51] and that you will be just renewed in the
[1:27:54] spirit so that you can have whatever it
[1:27:57] is that you've come needing from the
[1:27:59] Lord tonight let's pray together father
[1:28:02] we are so thankful for the for the
[1:28:05] release that comes when we are able to
[1:28:09] roll our heavy burdens over onto you

[1:28:14] daddy and grandparents and
[1:28:17] great-grandparents and Believers all
[1:28:20] over this nation and perhaps the world
[1:28:22] that are lifting up little baby Josiah
[1:28:25] and Lord we stand in agreement with them
[1:28:28] tonight knowing that there is nothing
[1:28:30] too hard for you to do I would like to
[1:28:34] confuse the doctors I'd like to baffle
[1:28:37] the demons I I would really like to see
[1:28:40] confusion come to Satan's Camp I would
[1:28:43] like for you to come into that hospital
[1:28:45] room Lord and perform a miracle as only
[1:28:49] you can
[1:28:51] swear calling on you to release the
[1:28:54] power of the creative spoken word over
[1:28:57] that precious little baby oh God do what
[1:29:02] they say is impossible we lift him up to
[1:29:06] you right now in the name of Jesus we
[1:29:10] ask you to touch Ezekiel Joseph right
[1:29:13] now in the name of the Lord It's not the
[1:29:16] temperature but it's what causes the
[1:29:19] temperature that needs to be dealt with
[1:29:21] Lord Jesus go to the root of that right
[1:29:24] now and deliver his body
[1:29:26] many others who are not here tonight
[1:29:29] because they're fighting various
[1:29:31] symptoms and various things you're the
[1:29:33] Healer
[1:29:35] you're the Healer and you're more than
[1:29:37] able to heal now I ask you to protect us
[1:29:40] who are gathered in this house tonight
[1:29:42] some are fearful because of things they
[1:29:45] have been through I'm asking you to
[1:29:48] protect each one
[1:29:51] we've all come through many cold Seasons
[1:29:53] together and flu Seasons together and
[1:29:57] you are more than able to stop these
[1:30:00] things
[1:30:01] Hallelujah that they would not go
[1:30:03] through this body or through those
[1:30:05] visiting this body we claim our healing
[1:30:09] come on
[1:30:12] we claim our healing
[1:30:15] in the name of Jesus
[1:30:17] from the top of our head to the souls of
[1:30:19] our feet many right here need a healing
[1:30:22] in their body and we look to you Jesus
[1:30:26] now would you come and help us in your
[1:30:27] word tonight
[1:30:29] it would be futile for me to ask you to
[1:30:31] anoint it it is the anointing your word
[1:30:34] is anointing it is Anointed but I ask
[1:30:37] you to anoint our ears to hear and I ask
[1:30:40] you to anoint your servant to deliver
[1:30:43] what you have placed in my heart and I
[1:30:45] will give you glory every one of us will
[1:30:48] rejoice in you for your God Alone In The
[1:30:51] Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[1:30:53] and the church said
[1:30:55] Psalm 73 if you have your Bible you can
[1:30:59] look there with me for just a moment
[1:31:01] and I need your prayers tonight because
[1:31:05] I want to do exactly what the Lord would
[1:31:07] have me to do and I want to say exactly
[1:31:10] what he would have me to say and I've
[1:31:12] been with him today and I appreciate his
[1:31:15] presence
[1:31:16] you're never alone when you have the
[1:31:18] Lord
[1:31:19] if you'll just call on him my granny
[1:31:21] taught me many years ago my precious
[1:31:24] precious granny taught me many years ago
[1:31:26] if you ever feel alone if you'll just
[1:31:28] start saying out loud I love you Jesus
[1:31:32] I love you Jesus I love you Jesus and
[1:31:35] mean it from your heart and say it till
[1:31:37] you do mean it she said
[1:31:39] I promise you
[1:31:41] you'll either hear him say or you'll
[1:31:43] feel him come and give you a witness
[1:31:46] that he loves you as well and I want you
[1:31:48] to know in my darkest and most lonely
[1:31:50] hours when I was watching my mother
[1:31:53] being beat as a child and when it looked
[1:31:56] like that she would be killed and there
[1:31:58] would be nothing that I would be strong
[1:31:59] enough to do it was in those moments
[1:32:01] that I would raise my hands in my
[1:32:03] bedroom and put my hands on the door of
[1:32:06] the rest of the house and I would pray I
[1:32:09] love you Jesus I love you Jesus will you
[1:32:11] help us will you spare my mother's life
[1:32:14] will you let your presence come into
[1:32:16] this home will you stop those demon
[1:32:18] spirits and you know what God spared her
[1:32:21] again and again and again I want you to
[1:32:24] know if you'll just tell him I love you
[1:32:26] I love you Lord I want to give you my
[1:32:29] heart I want to give you all that I am
[1:32:31] he'll let you know that he's real do you
[1:32:34] know he's real
[1:32:36] Psalm 73 and 1 truly God is good to
[1:32:40] Israel
[1:32:41] even to suchest are of a clean heart but
[1:32:45] as for me this is asaph
[1:32:48] we give David credit for all the Psalms
[1:32:50] but this is one of asaph Psalms he said
[1:32:53] but as for me my feet were almost gone
[1:32:57] my steps had well not slipped
[1:33:03] he goes to tell us why
[1:33:06] for I was envious
[1:33:09] at the foolish
[1:33:11] and when I saw the prosperity of the
[1:33:15] wicked and if we were to read on in in
[1:33:18] that chapter we would hear him just
[1:33:21] pouring out his heart
[1:33:22] I saw the those who committed evil
[1:33:25] prospering
[1:33:27] I saw those who had no regard for God
[1:33:30] and it looked like their life was a bed
[1:33:32] of ease I'm paraphrasing
[1:33:34] and mine was struggling and I began to
[1:33:37] see all of that and the next thing I
[1:33:39] know my feet were beginning to slip does
[1:33:42] anybody understand that
[1:33:44] it'll happen every time when you get
[1:33:46] your eyes off Jesus
[1:33:48] if you get your eyes on people you'll
[1:33:50] always find some slipperiness in your
[1:33:52] feet
[1:33:53] but I want you to know in verse 16 he
[1:33:56] said when I thought to know this
[1:33:59] it was too painful for me
[1:34:02] when he began to discover that God had a
[1:34:06] purpose
[1:34:08] for his suffering
[1:34:10] and there was a reason why that it
[1:34:13] seemed that the wicked were prospering
[1:34:15] he said when I fought to know this it
[1:34:18] was too painful for me until I went into
[1:34:23] the sanctuary of God
[1:34:26] then understood I their end
[1:34:31] when I got in the presence of God I
[1:34:35] began to understand there's a reason for
[1:34:37] everything
[1:34:39] this room could not contain the wounds
[1:34:42] and the pain and the hurt and the losses
[1:34:45] if we all begin to speak out our life
[1:34:48] story in here at the same time
[1:34:50] because we have known some hardship how
[1:34:53] many of you say I've known some troubles
[1:34:56] I've known some heartache some of you
[1:34:59] carrying some of that in here tonight
[1:35:00] but you are not alone
[1:35:03] you are not suffering alone
[1:35:05] everyone around you is care
[1:35:08] is King as well
[1:35:09] because we are being beautified
[1:35:13] glorified
[1:35:15] Sanctified by what's happening in our
[1:35:18] lives
[1:35:19] and one of these days we're going to
[1:35:21] come forth with that Authority that we
[1:35:23] were just talking about and I want you
[1:35:25] to know it's nearer than what you could
[1:35:27] even imagine
[1:35:28] and I wouldn't even be surprised if
[1:35:30] somebody were to raise up in here
[1:35:32] tonight falling under that full
[1:35:34] authority of the spoken word we're that
[1:35:37] close to it amen one of these days we're
[1:35:39] going to be gathered don't you talk
[1:35:41] about the restoration of the spoken word
[1:35:43] god did that a generation ago his word
[1:35:46] has already been restored he's just
[1:35:49] waiting on a people that can carry it
[1:35:51] without prejudice
[1:35:53] amen
[1:35:55] he's looking for a people that can carry
[1:35:57] it without prejudice
[1:35:59] so that we use it only for the purposes
[1:36:01] of God and not to build our own kingdom
[1:36:04] anybody understand we're almost done
[1:36:07] here he said until I went into the
[1:36:09] sanctuary of God then I understood
[1:36:11] therein surely thou did it set them in
[1:36:13] Slippery places thou casteth them down
[1:36:16] into destruction My Feet May slip around
[1:36:19] a little bit on planet Earth
[1:36:21] but asaph said
[1:36:23] the slipping I do does not even begin to
[1:36:27] compare with the slipping that the
[1:36:29] wicked are going to do in the end
[1:36:30] because they're going to slip right off
[1:36:32] into destruction and God who is God who
[1:36:36] is God who is God is able to establish
[1:36:38] my feet he's able to strengthen me in
[1:36:41] the way if you believe that same man you
[1:36:44] may be seated I feel you now please stay
[1:36:47] with me I'm not like some I'm begging
[1:36:51] you I'm I'm not embarrassed I beg you to
[1:36:54] stay with me please stay with me it's
[1:36:57] the only way I'll be able to deliver
[1:36:58] this in in a timely manner and some of
[1:37:02] you don't have hope for that but have
[1:37:03] some hope have some hope please have
[1:37:06] some hope second Samuel chapter 9 verses
[1:37:10] 3 and 4. I want you to go with me there
[1:37:13] for just a moment and the King said
[1:37:17] and the King said is there not yet any
[1:37:21] of the House of Saul
[1:37:24] that I may show the kindness of God unto
[1:37:28] him
[1:37:29] and Zeba said unto the king Jonathan how
[1:37:33] many of you remember Jonathan
[1:37:35] how many of you remember that beautiful
[1:37:37] brotherly bond between David and
[1:37:40] Jonathan
[1:37:42] ah I've heard I've heard the perverted
[1:37:45] uh people trying to say there was
[1:37:48] something uh something you know
[1:37:50] inappropriate
[1:37:53] how how horrible to say such a thing as
[1:37:57] that
[1:37:58] it's to say that that God couldn't give
[1:38:02] brotherly fraternal affection to one
[1:38:06] another let me tell you something
[1:38:07] everybody needs a brother like that
[1:38:11] everybody needs somebody to go into the
[1:38:13] trench with you and stand with you in
[1:38:15] the Foxhole
[1:38:17] come on that's got your back
[1:38:19] David and Jonathan had this amazing
[1:38:23] friendship with one another and uh now
[1:38:27] Saul is gone and a new king is in place
[1:38:31] the king that Saul was so jealous of
[1:38:35] until it almost consumed his very
[1:38:38] physical form and now he he said I I
[1:38:42] made a covenant to Jonathan and I made a
[1:38:47] covenant to Saul do you remember that he
[1:38:50] covenanted with both of them that he
[1:38:52] would show kindness to the household of
[1:38:55] Saul and so he said I I would like to
[1:38:58] know if there is any yet of the House of
[1:39:01] Saul that I might show some kindness
[1:39:04] unto them and Zeba said unto the king
[1:39:06] Jonathan hath yet a son which is lame on
[1:39:10] his feet
[1:39:12] and uh you know uh David well that
[1:39:16] really pleased him because he really
[1:39:18] loved Jonathan and he said what a
[1:39:21] wonderful way for me to keep my Covenant
[1:39:24] with Jonathan and with Saul I didn't
[1:39:26] even realize that Jonathan had a son
[1:39:29] alive why because he had been banished
[1:39:32] down to lodibar and if you don't know it
[1:39:35] lodibar was not a desirable place it
[1:39:39] wasn't like Naples Florida it wasn't
[1:39:42] like the French Riviera lodibar was a
[1:39:45] dried up desert Wilderness place and you
[1:39:49] were if you lived there it was because
[1:39:52] you were an Untouchable it's because you
[1:39:54] were not very desirable in society
[1:39:58] but let me tell you something
[1:40:00] you because you've spent some time in
[1:40:03] lodibar doesn't mean you have to be
[1:40:05] there forever
[1:40:07] you with me
[1:40:09] the king said where is he and Zeba said
[1:40:12] unto the king behold he is in the house
[1:40:14] of my car the son of Amiel in lodibar
[1:40:19] now here was a man whose name is not
[1:40:23] even mentioned here
[1:40:24] when ziba the servant began to talk to
[1:40:28] King David he didn't even mention his
[1:40:30] name he just said he's Jonathan's son
[1:40:32] and he was known only
[1:40:36] by his handicap
[1:40:40] I want you to hear me
[1:40:42] he was known only by what was wrong with
[1:40:45] him
[1:40:47] you ever treated anybody like that
[1:40:50] we all have somewhere along the way
[1:40:52] didn't even get a mention of name and
[1:40:55] and where is this that this was someone
[1:40:57] from the Royal House of King Saul
[1:41:02] someone who who should have had some
[1:41:05] privilege extended to him along the way
[1:41:08] but but instead because he was crippled
[1:41:12] in his feet he was banished and he was
[1:41:15] nearly forgotten how many of you
[1:41:18] understand his situation are you still
[1:41:20] with me are you going to keep asking us
[1:41:22] that I am
[1:41:25] and don't tell me no stories
[1:41:27] if you're not just say I wasn't but I'm
[1:41:29] coming back to you right now
[1:41:31] he was living in Exile from the King he
[1:41:36] was filled with rejection and shame and
[1:41:39] he was living so far below the lifestyle
[1:41:42] that he deserved he was remembered only
[1:41:46] because of a covenant that David made
[1:41:49] with Jonathan and with Saul if you want
[1:41:51] to mark it down in first Samuel 20 verse
[1:41:55] 14 and 15 you can read about the
[1:41:58] Covenant that that David made with
[1:42:01] Jonathan and if you want to read about
[1:42:04] the Covenant he made with Saul you can
[1:42:06] do that in first Samuel chapter 24
[1:42:09] verses 20 and 22 and if we had time we
[1:42:13] would read it but we don't have time for
[1:42:15] that and I want you to know that David
[1:42:18] he he decided at some point when the
[1:42:21] kingdom settled a little bit there had
[1:42:23] been a whole lot going on in Israel you
[1:42:26] want to list real quick the nation had
[1:42:29] split as brother Greeley told us the
[1:42:31] other night when Saul died David was
[1:42:34] ruling the southern portion of Israel
[1:42:37] and Ishmael sheth was reigning in the
[1:42:39] northern portion and if you'll remember
[1:42:42] Abner Saul's greatest General would be
[1:42:45] murdered by joab who was David's
[1:42:48] greatest General in the gates of Hebron
[1:42:51] and at some point Ishmael chefs own men
[1:42:55] murdered him
[1:42:56] cut off his head and sent it to King
[1:42:59] David
[1:43:00] I'm telling you this is a movie in the
[1:43:02] making
[1:43:04] this is a bloody mess that is going on
[1:43:07] and people are vying for power a whole
[1:43:10] lot is going on and finally after all of
[1:43:14] this Warfare and bloodshed and fighting
[1:43:16] for a position David finally came into
[1:43:20] the United Kingdom 20 years
[1:43:24] he finally began to rule over both
[1:43:27] houses
[1:43:28] 20 years after he had been anointed
[1:43:32] by the prophet Samuel
[1:43:34] are you here
[1:43:36] 20 years
[1:43:38] so 20 years of waiting is nothing
[1:43:41] and 30 years of waiting is nothing
[1:43:43] because if God said it
[1:43:47] it settles it
[1:43:50] I said if God said it
[1:43:52] it settles it
[1:43:54] you know we say them so often if God
[1:43:57] said it I believe it it settles it
[1:43:58] that's right that's how it works in your
[1:44:00] life you've got to believe it to
[1:44:02] activate it in your life amen but the
[1:44:05] truth is even bigger than that if God
[1:44:07] said it that settles it
[1:44:09] his word is forever settled in heaven
[1:44:11] how about squeezing out an amen you you
[1:44:14] may need one in a minute so squeeze one
[1:44:17] out as you can so 20 years later
[1:44:20] David is now in the throne and he must
[1:44:24] have started relaxing a little bit
[1:44:27] no one was sending him heads anymore
[1:44:30] his General wasn't killing somebody
[1:44:32] else's General and somebody's General
[1:44:34] wasn't killing his General and my he's
[1:44:37] just going to relax just a little bit
[1:44:38] and all of a sudden he's sitting there
[1:44:40] on the throne one day and he said oh
[1:44:43] I had a promise I made a vow I made a
[1:44:48] covenant and I need to start thinking
[1:44:50] about how I can keep my word I'm just
[1:44:53] thankful that he remembered his word
[1:44:56] it's a valuable thing when you say
[1:44:58] something to do what you say and mean
[1:45:00] what you say that's integrity
[1:45:02] whether no one's watching or not God's
[1:45:04] watching
[1:45:06] we need to do what we say and so all of
[1:45:08] a sudden this came to David's heart and
[1:45:10] he started getting the servants around
[1:45:12] and I've already read that portion of it
[1:45:14] to you and you begin to understand in in
[1:45:17] second Samuel 4 4 let's go there just a
[1:45:19] moment just getting this part out of the
[1:45:22] way and Jonathan Saul's son had a son
[1:45:26] that was lame of his feet
[1:45:29] he was five years old this is where
[1:45:31] we're going to begin to learn about the
[1:45:32] Sun
[1:45:33] he was five years old when the tidings
[1:45:36] came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel
[1:45:40] this is the death of Saul and Jonathan
[1:45:43] in Jezreel and his nurse
[1:45:45] who the nurse of the little
[1:45:47] five-year-old boy the nurse took him up
[1:45:51] and fled why would she do such a thing
[1:45:54] as that because she knew that the ones
[1:45:57] that had killed Saul and Jonathan would
[1:45:59] now be coming for their entire family
[1:46:02] and she had the best intention in her
[1:46:05] heart and that was to protect this
[1:46:07] little boy so she grabbed up this little
[1:46:09] five-year-old toddler and she began to
[1:46:12] make haste and she got in such a hurry
[1:46:15] that he fell
[1:46:18] you with me
[1:46:19] he fell right out of her arms
[1:46:22] and it was such a severe fall that he
[1:46:26] became lame
[1:46:28] and it's here that we learn that his
[1:46:31] name was mephibosheth say that with me
[1:46:33] mephibosheth we didn't know his name
[1:46:36] when we were reading a moment ago but
[1:46:38] now we know his name and we know how he
[1:46:41] was lame how he became lame in his feet
[1:46:44] and we're going to boil this down for
[1:46:46] you now and we're going to say he's lame
[1:46:49] because somebody dropped him
[1:46:54] I want you to say that I really do I
[1:46:57] want you to just humor me
[1:46:59] he's lame because somebody dropped him
[1:47:03] that's the only reason why
[1:47:06] the only reason why it's crippled is
[1:47:09] because somebody dropped him
[1:47:10] in this particular case she didn't mean
[1:47:13] to drop him
[1:47:14] she didn't mean to cause him any harm it
[1:47:17] was an accident
[1:47:20] but how many of you know that didn't
[1:47:21] heal his feet
[1:47:23] the accident didn't change his condition
[1:47:26] because it happened accidentally didn't
[1:47:28] make it any easier for him and he spent
[1:47:31] the rest of his life over there hiding
[1:47:34] in a place of banishment and in a place
[1:47:37] of a very simple condition without good
[1:47:41] food to eat and without proper hygiene
[1:47:43] he was no more than if he were a leper
[1:47:46] on the side of the road somewhere
[1:47:48] forgotten and forsaken why
[1:47:52] not because he was mentally ill
[1:47:55] Stay With Me
[1:47:56] not because he had a brain injury
[1:48:00] simply because his feet didn't work
[1:48:05] and why did his feet stop working
[1:48:10] because somebody dropped him
[1:48:14] and why did a royal son of a king
[1:48:18] grandson of a king find himself in this
[1:48:22] pitiful condition because somebody
[1:48:25] dropped him
[1:48:27] right
[1:48:28] didn't mean to
[1:48:30] but somebody dropped him
[1:48:33] now you look at that word lame in the
[1:48:35] Bible
[1:48:36] and it's a pretty serious word I don't
[1:48:38] have time to go to Leviticus 21 but you
[1:48:41] mark it down
[1:48:42] Leviticus 21
[1:48:44] 16-23 will tell you let me just get to
[1:48:47] one verse here that if you're if you're
[1:48:49] broken-footed
[1:48:51] or broken-handed
[1:48:53] or you have a crooked back
[1:48:56] or you're a dwarf or you have Stones
[1:49:00] broken or you have some blemish
[1:49:04] you cannot be a priest
[1:49:06] of the most high God neither can you
[1:49:09] enter in to the most holy place
[1:49:13] no I didn't don't be mad at me
[1:49:16] I didn't make that law God did and he
[1:49:19] did it for a reason
[1:49:21] so no illegitimate child
[1:49:24] was allowed in the priesthood
[1:49:26] nobody who had had some emasculating
[1:49:30] problem uh an accident or something and
[1:49:33] lost his ability to procreate he could
[1:49:35] not
[1:49:36] even someone who were crippled in their
[1:49:39] feet perhaps because I have Gaudi
[1:49:41] arthritis that might be something or I
[1:49:44] had it let me get that out I had it used
[1:49:46] to have it long time ago
[1:49:48] don't even usually call the name
[1:49:50] but I did for for for effect maybe even
[1:49:54] I would be because I limp sometime
[1:49:57] now I limp when I'm tired
[1:49:59] you see me limping around here
[1:50:01] in pain or not in pain I just limp it
[1:50:04] may sometimes be a habit some people say
[1:50:07] are you hurting and I'll say no am I
[1:50:08] limping so even that right there could
[1:50:12] possibly have disqualified me
[1:50:15] though I was born in a Royal Priestly
[1:50:18] family that was enough perhaps to keep
[1:50:21] me from serving in the holiest place
[1:50:25] pretty sad isn't it I didn't do anything
[1:50:27] to cause that mephibosheth didn't do
[1:50:30] anything to cause his feet to be
[1:50:32] it's a pretty serious thing but remember
[1:50:34] God has a reason for everything
[1:50:36] now now mephibosheth's name you might
[1:50:39] want to mark this down it means
[1:50:40] contending with shame
[1:50:43] who named him mephiboshea
[1:50:47] I'd like to just remind you be careful
[1:50:51] what kind of name you hang on your
[1:50:53] children
[1:50:55] please please please please don't name
[1:50:58] them after some old rock star
[1:51:01] please don't name them Elvis
[1:51:06] please don't name them after some old
[1:51:08] movie star
[1:51:10] some old hag out there in the world
[1:51:12] anybody with me
[1:51:14] don't name them some demonic name
[1:51:18] some name of a devil or name of a demon
[1:51:20] you really want are you are you
[1:51:22] listening
[1:51:23] you're the one to hang that Destiny on
[1:51:25] your children you mean to tell me
[1:51:27] brother Shelley you really believe that
[1:51:28] yes and because all through the Bible
[1:51:32] the spirit would reveal a name and a mom
[1:51:35] and a daddy would name a child and it
[1:51:37] would Mark the destiny of that child
[1:51:41] I know some of you didn't know that when
[1:51:43] you named your children and so what you
[1:51:45] need to do is Lay Your Hands on their
[1:51:47] head and redeem them by the authority of
[1:51:50] Jesus Christ
[1:51:52] and if that doesn't work change their
[1:51:54] name
[1:52:02] and do it right
[1:52:04] do it legal
[1:52:05] so that they didn't have to embarrass
[1:52:07] them anybody with me
[1:52:11] now he's named mephibosheth which means
[1:52:15] contending
[1:52:17] with shame
[1:52:19] it also means scattering
[1:52:21] of Shame
[1:52:23] so everywhere he went
[1:52:27] which wasn't many places
[1:52:29] because he couldn't walk
[1:52:32] he was carried everywhere he went and
[1:52:37] this proposed a big problem
[1:52:39] because he had trust issues
[1:52:43] punch your neighbor and say you can get
[1:52:44] a nap tonight don't so sleep now
[1:52:46] come on
[1:52:48] I'm gonna wake you up tonight
[1:52:50] I want you to hear this I really do
[1:52:54] I want you to hear this
[1:52:56] he had trust issues
[1:52:58] wouldn't you have had trust issues the
[1:53:01] only person you trusted besides your
[1:53:03] mother was your nurse and your own maid
[1:53:06] your own nurse the one who was charged
[1:53:09] to care for you is the one who dropped
[1:53:11] you
[1:53:12] she is the one that caused you to be
[1:53:14] lame
[1:53:15] she is what the one who caused you to be
[1:53:18] disqualified
[1:53:20] from a normal life
[1:53:22] she's the one that caused you to end up
[1:53:25] in load a bar
[1:53:26] with cornbread
[1:53:29] and a little bit of water or whatever is
[1:53:31] his meal was
[1:53:33] and now in order to go somewhere
[1:53:37] to pay a tax or to do whatever he had to
[1:53:39] do he had to be carried
[1:53:42] they didn't have wheelchairs
[1:53:44] they'd have motor scooters
[1:53:46] that means every time he had to allow
[1:53:49] someone to scoop him up like a sack of
[1:53:53] potatoes and carry him wherever he went
[1:53:56] and the only reason why it had to be
[1:53:58] that way is because somebody
[1:54:01] that he trusted
[1:54:03] dropped him
[1:54:07] it's really really sad
[1:54:09] it's really sad
[1:54:11] and now his life is filled with shame
[1:54:15] the one that had been entrusted with his
[1:54:18] care the one who had probably grown to
[1:54:20] love him as though he were her own son
[1:54:23] not on purpose not with malicious intent
[1:54:26] nevertheless
[1:54:28] she dropped him
[1:54:30] now here's the reality Church most of us
[1:54:37] are you ready for me to name the frogs
[1:54:42] the verse have been dropped
[1:54:45] [Music]
[1:54:48] somebody dropped me
[1:54:51] oh my
[1:54:53] this is going to be an encouraging
[1:54:55] message
[1:54:57] well we got to get through the reality
[1:54:59] of why we're limping
[1:55:01] I want to be able to help you identify
[1:55:03] your limp
[1:55:04] so you can get healed tonight
[1:55:07] I want you to leave here dancing
[1:55:10] I want you to leave here with victory
[1:55:12] tonight I want you to know you're not
[1:55:14] the only one that somebody failed
[1:55:17] I've been failed I know what it means to
[1:55:20] be failed I know what it means to be
[1:55:22] dropped I know what it means to be
[1:55:24] betrayed
[1:55:26] but I'm not going to live my life and
[1:55:29] load a bar
[1:55:31] I know who I am I know who I am I'm a
[1:55:36] son of the most high God and I can't
[1:55:40] live beneath what I know he has given to
[1:55:42] us can't do it anymore I simply can't do
[1:55:46] it anymore
[1:55:47] so we've been failed yes every one of us
[1:55:50] dropped along the way by someone we
[1:55:52] trusted someone who was supposed to have
[1:55:55] our best interest in mind
[1:55:58] it's going to get a little tough okay
[1:56:00] now listen
[1:56:02] it is not my desire
[1:56:04] to stir your hurts
[1:56:06] come on I need prayer
[1:56:09] it is not my desire
[1:56:11] to stir your hurts or scrape your scars
[1:56:17] that's not my desire
[1:56:19] but I find out that sometime if they
[1:56:22] don't get scraped a little bit and we
[1:56:24] don't get reminded of them a little bit
[1:56:26] they identify who we are and you are not
[1:56:30] to be known by your scars
[1:56:33] that's not what's going to identify you
[1:56:35] in this bride's Revival in this move of
[1:56:37] God you're not going to be known by who
[1:56:39] dropped you
[1:56:40] and how you ended up
[1:56:42] you're not going to be remember where
[1:56:44] you come from
[1:56:46] or who you used to answer to
[1:56:50] you're going to be known as the son of
[1:56:51] the most high God
[1:56:53] because before this thing is over you're
[1:56:55] going to put your feet under the king's
[1:56:57] table
[1:56:59] you with me
[1:57:00] we've been failed by others as many of
[1:57:03] us have numerous times along the way for
[1:57:06] some it was not intentional for some it
[1:57:08] was not on purpose for some it was just
[1:57:10] like mephibosheth this wasn't a woman
[1:57:12] who hated him this was a woman who loved
[1:57:14] him this this was someone who nurtured
[1:57:16] him but she was she was not capable of
[1:57:18] protecting him in the moment
[1:57:22] in that emotional fearful moment that he
[1:57:27] needed to be protected the most
[1:57:31] should I ask again
[1:57:33] are you with me
[1:57:36] we've been failed by others
[1:57:38] we need to understand that folks cannot
[1:57:41] always be
[1:57:42] what we need them to be
[1:57:45] or what we want them to be
[1:57:47] it's not fair
[1:57:49] but it's life
[1:57:51] you better quit dwelling in the realm of
[1:57:53] it's not fair
[1:57:56] and start understanding Redemption
[1:57:58] once you get a revelation of redemption
[1:58:01] and and God's justice
[1:58:04] and his equity
[1:58:06] you don't worry about what's fair or not
[1:58:11] because this is not a promise I'm gonna
[1:58:13] I'm Gonna Save you and then everything
[1:58:15] that happens to you is going to be fair
[1:58:17] but who's to say
[1:58:20] we base it on our own opinion and our
[1:58:22] own thoughts anyway don't we
[1:58:24] we need to understand that folks can't
[1:58:26] always be what we want them to be or
[1:58:28] what we need them to be
[1:58:31] and you've been dropped
[1:58:33] it might have been apparent
[1:58:35] it might have been a mother it might
[1:58:37] have been a father
[1:58:38] who did not fully provide for all the
[1:58:42] needs that you would have in life
[1:58:45] Stay With Me
[1:58:47] they may have simply not been
[1:58:50] emotionally capable
[1:58:54] to meet all of your needs
[1:58:57] they might not have been
[1:58:59] they may have come from a similar
[1:59:02] dysfunction
[1:59:04] hurt people hurt people
[1:59:08] broken people break people
[1:59:10] [Music]
[1:59:12] dysfunctional people usually help create
[1:59:16] dysfunction
[1:59:19] now are you going to spend your life
[1:59:20] blaming
[1:59:22] someone
[1:59:24] who was dysfunctional
[1:59:27] who was raised in an environment of
[1:59:29] dysfunction and passed it on are you
[1:59:32] really going to spend your life hating
[1:59:34] somebody because you were dropped
[1:59:38] or are you going to realize that
[1:59:40] everybody has been dropped in some way
[1:59:43] or another and we're not comparing my
[1:59:45] life to your life and your life to my
[1:59:47] life we're looking to find the Life of
[1:59:49] Christ
[1:59:52] now years have passed
[1:59:54] from your childhood
[1:59:57] and you are still somehow crippled
[2:00:01] some of us
[2:00:02] by the negligence
[2:00:04] of our parents
[2:00:09] it might have been more than negligence
[2:00:13] it could have been physical abuse
[2:00:16] the ones that should have protected you
[2:00:19] from violence and harm
[2:00:22] may have been the very ones
[2:00:25] that inflicted it on you
[2:00:27] yes you were dropped
[2:00:30] you were failed
[2:00:32] and I'm sincere when I say to you I'm
[2:00:35] sorry
[2:00:36] I'm really sorry
[2:00:38] that should not have happened
[2:00:40] to you
[2:00:43] appropriate behavior
[2:00:46] it could have been that you were scarred
[2:00:49] from from exposure to sexuality
[2:00:53] way before you were old enough to even
[2:00:55] understand what was going on and it
[2:00:58] might have been apparent
[2:01:00] I don't have words
[2:01:04] I don't have words
[2:01:06] I don't understand it
[2:01:09] I can't explain it
[2:01:11] I can only tell you I'm so sorry
[2:01:14] I can only tell you but I'm I'm getting
[2:01:16] ahead of myself to do it but I got to
[2:01:18] now for a moment I can only tell you
[2:01:21] he Bears all of our burdens
[2:01:24] he heals all of our wounds
[2:01:27] he carries on he he has bomb I'm telling
[2:01:29] you
[2:01:30] I don't have anything for sale tonight
[2:01:33] I'm not trying to sell you anything I'm
[2:01:35] telling you what I believe with all my
[2:01:36] heart he has a bombshell
[2:01:39] he has a healing bomb like no other
[2:01:42] that he can rub on your wound why hadn't
[2:01:45] he already done it have you let him have
[2:01:47] you been vulnerable in his presence have
[2:01:49] you really or or have you done what most
[2:01:51] of us do pushed it down pushed it down
[2:01:54] and pushed it down because you didn't
[2:01:56] want to face the the pain and The Agony
[2:01:59] and the fear that comes you've just
[2:02:01] pushed it down
[2:02:02] have you really ever laid it out before
[2:02:05] him
[2:02:07] and set my feet are lame
[2:02:11] because somebody dropped me
[2:02:14] and I don't want to live
[2:02:17] I've got to have help
[2:02:21] maybe someone exposed you
[2:02:24] maybe someone touched you
[2:02:27] maybe a parent
[2:02:35] maybe there were other forms of abuse
[2:02:38] I'm so sorry
[2:02:41] that was more than enough
[2:02:44] to cause you to be a little crippled
[2:02:47] to cause you to be a little lame
[2:02:50] I'm so sorry
[2:02:52] might have been an ex-husband
[2:02:55] ex-wife
[2:02:57] who hurt you to the Core
[2:02:59] with their infidelity
[2:03:02] that sick anguishing feeling
[2:03:07] that still runs deep in your soul
[2:03:11] the bitter sting of betrayal hurt worse
[2:03:14] than if you would would have had to
[2:03:16] endure
[2:03:17] a physical blow
[2:03:21] it could be that you have never bounced
[2:03:23] back
[2:03:24] from all the lies
[2:03:26] it could be that you have never really
[2:03:28] learned to trust anybody
[2:03:33] because of
[2:03:35] being dropped
[2:03:37] maybe it was verbal abuse
[2:03:41] maybe you were called stupid
[2:03:44] maybe you were called a failure
[2:03:48] maybe you were told by your own parents
[2:03:50] you'd never amount to anything
[2:03:55] you know even Christian parents
[2:03:58] can be abusive
[2:04:03] you don't have to strike your child in
[2:04:05] Anger to be abusive
[2:04:08] and just let me be sure to say here that
[2:04:10] I believe in corporal punishment
[2:04:14] and my children were all disciplined
[2:04:16] that way
[2:04:18] but not in anger
[2:04:21] it was used to train
[2:04:24] because we have a responsibility to
[2:04:26] train our children not beat them into
[2:04:29] compliance
[2:04:31] may I also say that God In His Infinite
[2:04:33] Wisdom gave a child some extra padding
[2:04:39] in the most appropriate place where they
[2:04:41] sit
[2:04:43] and even some people have misused the
[2:04:46] force
[2:04:49] and applied it in a way that was far too
[2:04:52] severe for the crime
[2:04:55] and maybe you were even in a situation
[2:04:57] where you took it for other siblings
[2:05:01] because there was no fairness in your
[2:05:03] home
[2:05:05] maybe your parents didn't understand
[2:05:07] that that your your gluteus maximus
[2:05:12] your hind end is where that kind of
[2:05:14] punishment not your arm not your hand
[2:05:16] not your face not your shoulder not your
[2:05:19] back not your leg
[2:05:25] maybe they didn't know
[2:05:28] that a slap
[2:05:30] provokes anger
[2:05:33] and Brokenness
[2:05:35] and it does absolutely nothing to train
[2:05:38] a child to do right it only causes them
[2:05:40] to fear the parent and you're never ever
[2:05:43] going to be able to make any inroads
[2:05:45] with a child that fears you to that
[2:05:48] extent
[2:05:50] you may have been the victim it's quiet
[2:05:54] you may have been the victim of that
[2:05:58] and I'm sorry
[2:06:02] my mother whipped me excessively
[2:06:05] because she was a broken and angry
[2:06:08] person
[2:06:12] problem is
[2:06:14] I needed it probably
[2:06:17] from time to time
[2:06:22] but there's something about that SWAT
[2:06:26] that stirs up all that emotion in a
[2:06:29] broken person
[2:06:30] and they're not able to gauge sometime
[2:06:33] or measure how much is enough how much
[2:06:38] how much pressure is enough
[2:06:40] and how much is abusive
[2:06:43] so I know what it means for the blood to
[2:06:45] run
[2:06:49] and I know what it means to carry marks
[2:06:51] and bruises
[2:06:54] and I'm not angry with my mother
[2:06:58] I realize that she was disciplining the
[2:07:01] best that she could but in so many ways
[2:07:04] my mama Who Loved Me dropped me
[2:07:10] my dad rejected me early
[2:07:12] he dropped me
[2:07:15] but I'm no longer angry
[2:07:20] I understand
[2:07:22] I want you to understand
[2:07:26] the bitter sting of betrayal and
[2:07:29] infidelity and marriage hurt worse than
[2:07:30] it would have if you would have had to
[2:07:32] endure a physical blow maybe it was a
[2:07:34] verbal abuse that reshaped and redefine
[2:07:37] who you really were they're women
[2:07:39] sitting in this room who don't even know
[2:07:41] who they are because they have become
[2:07:45] questions
[2:07:47] so reshaped
[2:07:50] and reformed by the hate-filled words
[2:07:54] that have been spoken over them by
[2:07:57] someone who professed to love them
[2:08:03] somebody got dropped
[2:08:09] you've been left a little handicapped
[2:08:11] and unable to fully function
[2:08:13] like others around you
[2:08:16] it may have been a pastor
[2:08:18] it might have been a preacher who
[2:08:21] wounded you so deeply
[2:08:23] that you've never fully recovered from
[2:08:25] the blow
[2:08:26] maybe he betrayed your confidence or God
[2:08:30] forbid maybe he made advances toward you
[2:08:32] or someone else in the church
[2:08:35] there are kids in this room who have
[2:08:37] been are adults in this room who are
[2:08:39] abused
[2:08:41] by men of God
[2:08:48] maybe it was another kind of church hurt
[2:08:51] that dropped you along the way
[2:08:53] a bitter split
[2:08:55] or a debilitating Financial betrayal
[2:08:59] maybe too many times you found yourself
[2:09:01] the subject of vicious gossip
[2:09:05] and innuendos in a church
[2:09:09] if so there's no wonder why you struggle
[2:09:13] to trust anyone
[2:09:16] you were dropped
[2:09:19] perhaps it was another kind of situation
[2:09:21] in life a setback in a business a loss
[2:09:23] of a career a troubling health problem a
[2:09:26] partner who went back on his word
[2:09:30] maybe it was the loss of someone dear
[2:09:33] in a time when you felt like you needed
[2:09:36] them the most
[2:09:38] some of you lost your parents and your
[2:09:41] grandparents at such an early and
[2:09:43] vulnerable age that it has affected your
[2:09:46] life I could not possibly take the time
[2:09:50] or have the mind to be able to think of
[2:09:53] all the scenarios that are represented
[2:09:56] in this room and by those streaming this
[2:09:59] service but I stand confidently to say
[2:10:01] you were dropped
[2:10:06] and the one thing I do know is that it
[2:10:09] was not your fault
[2:10:11] that you were dropped
[2:10:14] nonetheless
[2:10:17] it has affected you
[2:10:20] and some of us are still paying the
[2:10:22] price today
[2:10:23] for those who failed us
[2:10:25] some want nothing to do with church
[2:10:28] because of church hurts
[2:10:30] some want nothing to do with family
[2:10:34] because a family hurts
[2:10:36] come on
[2:10:38] some want nothing to do with marriage
[2:10:41] because of marriage hurts you may be the
[2:10:43] smartest of us all
[2:10:47] no it doesn't have to be that way
[2:10:51] it just simply doesn't have to be that
[2:10:53] way
[2:10:54] so whatever whoever whichever
[2:10:57] it's very likely that everyone in this
[2:10:59] room at some time or another was dropped
[2:11:01] and it has affected your walk
[2:11:04] it has affected your life
[2:11:06] I'm not going to ask you to raise your
[2:11:07] hand but I'm going to I'm going to ask
[2:11:09] you to nod your head or say Amen or or
[2:11:11] do something if you can acknowledge
[2:11:12] tonight that in some way you were failed
[2:11:15] you're not casting Stones you're not
[2:11:17] you're not throwing off on someone else
[2:11:19] you're just being honest and you're just
[2:11:21] saying I was dropped I've been failed
[2:11:23] I've been hurt I've been wounded I've
[2:11:24] been affected by it I think it's good to
[2:11:27] own it I think it's good to admit it I
[2:11:29] think it's good to confess it
[2:11:31] I think it's good to deal with it
[2:11:34] I think it's good to let God come and do
[2:11:36] something for us before we go home
[2:11:38] tonight
[2:11:40] come on now
[2:11:44] so finally one day the king
[2:11:47] he said is there anybody that I can show
[2:11:49] kindness to
[2:11:52] because of this
[2:11:54] Covenant that I made
[2:11:57] and the answer came from Zeba the
[2:11:59] servant he said oh yes he said there's a
[2:12:02] son who is lame
[2:12:06] it's a difficult thing with most people
[2:12:09] look at how Zeba answered back he's got
[2:12:11] a son he's crippled
[2:12:14] no mention of his name no mention of his
[2:12:17] potential value no mention of any hope
[2:12:20] no mention of any strengths
[2:12:24] he may have been a genius
[2:12:28] a prodigy
[2:12:31] but nothing of that was mentioned only a
[2:12:33] son who is lame
[2:12:36] simply just a man with a terrible
[2:12:38] problem and you have felt that way
[2:12:40] before in your life probably
[2:12:43] I'm just a man with a problem I'm just a
[2:12:46] woman with a problem
[2:12:49] I'm just a person with scars
[2:12:52] but I want to tell you something tonight
[2:12:55] that where Zeba saw a problem David
[2:12:58] noted a person
[2:13:01] where Zeba found the deficiency David
[2:13:04] saw Grace
[2:13:06] where Zeba so red flags and raised them
[2:13:09] high David saw green lights this is my
[2:13:14] opportunity
[2:13:15] where Zeba shows a handicap David said
[2:13:19] there ought to be some healing available
[2:13:22] and that's the way so is where the enemy
[2:13:25] sees you and defines you by your scars
[2:13:29] God sees beyond
[2:13:33] he sees you as you really are
[2:13:39] some of you have been dropped because of
[2:13:42] of addiction
[2:13:47] somebody showed you how to shoot it up
[2:13:51] how to snort it
[2:13:53] how to get it
[2:13:57] I've been in Revival meetings
[2:14:01] where junkies and suppliers
[2:14:04] got saved
[2:14:10] if a junkie is going to get delivered is
[2:14:12] a good idea for his supplier to get
[2:14:14] delivered
[2:14:18] [Applause]
[2:14:19] you've been dropped
[2:14:22] I know of situations
[2:14:25] just like that
[2:14:27] and they hurt
[2:14:29] no matter how crippled you may be
[2:14:32] I'm here tonight to tell you in the
[2:14:34] minutes I have left there's a king who's
[2:14:36] looking for you
[2:14:39] I want you to know that
[2:14:41] there's a king who's looking for you
[2:14:43] and he will not just see your broken
[2:14:45] feet
[2:14:49] you're more than a handicap to him
[2:14:53] you're more than a scar to him you're
[2:14:56] more than a broken one to him you're
[2:14:58] more than an Untouchable to him
[2:15:01] the king is seeking you out he'll scour
[2:15:03] the ends of the Earth
[2:15:06] there's no wall that he won't knock down
[2:15:08] there's no mountain he won't Climb come
[2:15:11] on
[2:15:12] there's no distance that he will not run
[2:15:16] coming after you
[2:15:19] [Applause]
[2:15:23] he's after you he wants you he knows
[2:15:29] more about you than anybody could
[2:15:32] possibly know and he still is after you
[2:15:37] he knows your warts he knows your
[2:15:41] pimples he knows your crooked nose
[2:15:45] he sees your varicose veins
[2:15:48] [Applause]
[2:15:50] he sees your bat wings
[2:15:54] your muffin top
[2:16:00] he sees it all and instead of Loving You
[2:16:04] Less
[2:16:07] he's chasing you more
[2:16:10] with a greater passion
[2:16:13] because he wants to change some things
[2:16:16] he wants to show you there's a place to
[2:16:18] put your feet help me
[2:16:21] help me
[2:16:22] no matter how crippled you may be no
[2:16:24] matter how handicapped you may be no
[2:16:26] matter how affected you may be by the
[2:16:28] pain in the abuse of your life you
[2:16:30] cannot forget tonight that there's a
[2:16:33] king
[2:16:34] and I want you to show him second Samuel
[2:16:36] 9 7. oh hallelujah oh it's just 8 15 but
[2:16:39] we're not we started out early
[2:16:43] whoa
[2:16:45] and David said unto him fear not
[2:16:53] for I will surely show thee kindness
[2:16:56] somebody had to tote him all the way
[2:17:00] from lodibar
[2:17:02] to the Palace
[2:17:06] somebody had to knock on the door
[2:17:10] he huddles in the corner
[2:17:12] and say today your number has been
[2:17:16] called
[2:17:17] today mephibosheth you've won the
[2:17:20] lottery of lotteries
[2:17:23] today mephibosheth your destiny is going
[2:17:26] to change forever because the king is
[2:17:28] calling the king
[2:17:31] the king
[2:17:32] the king is calling me do you think he
[2:17:34] was anxious to go
[2:17:37] no
[2:17:39] no
[2:17:40] because it was the custom in the
[2:17:42] exchanging of a kingdom
[2:17:44] that one king and his court would often
[2:17:46] seek out the descendants of a prior King
[2:17:50] and Kill Them All
[2:17:52] so here is mephiboshea shaking in his
[2:17:55] socks
[2:17:59] the king is calling me I thought I had
[2:18:02] ran far enough and he had long enough
[2:18:04] that I had been forgotten
[2:18:07] I thought that maybe he would show me
[2:18:09] mercy because of my handicap and would
[2:18:12] let me live out the rest of my years in
[2:18:15] this little hole in the wall but all
[2:18:17] you're here to tell me the king is
[2:18:19] calling for me yes yes
[2:18:23] the king is calling for you
[2:18:25] so when he starts getting the message
[2:18:27] he gets brought I will certainly have to
[2:18:30] skip quite a bit but
[2:18:32] this is what David says to him
[2:18:34] fear not
[2:18:38] for I will surely show thee kindness
[2:18:41] are you with me
[2:18:43] for Jonathan thy father's sake listen to
[2:18:46] this and we'll restore the all the land
[2:18:49] of Saul thy father
[2:18:52] that's a big Kingdom
[2:18:55] but you know what I think is more
[2:18:57] precious than land
[2:19:00] because if you've got crippled feet
[2:19:04] you're not doing a whole lot of walking
[2:19:07] not sure what a lot of value land course
[2:19:09] we know that land was valuable and there
[2:19:10] was money and and so forth we get all
[2:19:12] that
[2:19:13] but here's what I like
[2:19:17] you shall eat bread
[2:19:19] at my table
[2:19:23] continually
[2:19:26] now the king often had banquets
[2:19:29] but that's not what he was inviting him
[2:19:30] to
[2:19:31] he was inviting him to The Family Table
[2:19:35] he was inviting him for breakfast
[2:19:38] and for lunch and for dinner
[2:19:40] and for midnight snacks
[2:19:43] we don't have a delivery service down in
[2:19:45] lodibar so I'm gonna have to bring you
[2:19:46] up here and put you right in the palace
[2:19:47] you understand
[2:19:49] that a man who was hopeless and a man
[2:19:51] who was broken and a man who thought he
[2:19:53] would spend the rest of his life
[2:19:54] rejected and dejected and broken and
[2:19:57] shamed and made fun of it even his name
[2:19:59] meant shame
[2:20:01] has now been carried on the back of
[2:20:03] somebody all the way to the Palace
[2:20:06] and David has now said you you that hole
[2:20:09] in the wall down there that somebody let
[2:20:11] you live in I'm giving you the land
[2:20:16] that belonged to Saul your father and
[2:20:18] you will eat bread at my table
[2:20:20] continually
[2:20:27] it was a long way from
[2:20:29] load a bar
[2:20:31] lodibar means desolation dryness poverty
[2:20:34] and bitterness
[2:20:36] be careful the spirit that's over where
[2:20:38] you live
[2:20:42] come on
[2:20:43] be careful as much as possible be
[2:20:46] careful
[2:20:47] because the only thing the lame man got
[2:20:49] down in lodibar was stale bread from
[2:20:51] yesterday
[2:20:54] and he was forced to drink the tepid
[2:20:56] water from a muddy cistern
[2:20:58] but now he's going to be drinking from
[2:21:00] an overflowing well
[2:21:02] in the king's Palace
[2:21:04] lodavar was a place where you feed on
[2:21:06] crumbs
[2:21:08] anger crumbs and bitterness crumbs and
[2:21:10] jealousy crumbs and Malice crumbs and
[2:21:13] negative Faith crumbs and feel sorry for
[2:21:15] myself crumbs that I'm just a martyr and
[2:21:17] everybody hates me and nobody loves me
[2:21:19] and I'm gonna just eat worms
[2:21:24] but you don't have to eat those crumbs
[2:21:27] because the king is calling you out of
[2:21:30] lodibar
[2:21:33] you don't have to be identified by your
[2:21:35] abuse or associated with your abuser
[2:21:40] he's giving you an address change
[2:21:45] Hallelujah
[2:21:48] you felt like a dead dog
[2:21:51] and now you can feel like a son of the
[2:21:53] king
[2:21:54] he had to listen he had to deal with the
[2:21:56] fear of meeting the king he had to deal
[2:21:59] with all the trust issues because folks
[2:22:03] you can only use those excuses and
[2:22:06] that's what I'm going to call them
[2:22:07] because that's what I believe they
[2:22:09] become
[2:22:10] they're not excuses in the beginning
[2:22:12] they're they're the wise they're the
[2:22:15] wise
[2:22:16] but once you get an invitation to the
[2:22:18] King's house and his table if you choose
[2:22:21] to remain in lodibar then you're making
[2:22:24] excuses
[2:22:25] because God is offering you something
[2:22:27] far better than a life of addiction
[2:22:30] because many people are trying to drown
[2:22:32] their scars in alcohol
[2:22:35] or with a pill or with a or with pot or
[2:22:38] whatever else they use these days
[2:22:41] and the truth is there's something to
[2:22:43] offer you that's far better
[2:22:46] than any of those things
[2:22:48] it's a life of freedom in Jesus Christ
[2:22:52] oh hallelujah what a different
[2:22:54] atmosphere what a different atmosphere
[2:23:00] than the king in second Samuel 9 9 the
[2:23:03] king called the Zeb us all servant I
[2:23:04] want the musicians to come
[2:23:07] the king called the Zeb us all servant
[2:23:09] and said unto him I've given unto thy
[2:23:11] Master son all that pertained to Saul
[2:23:15] and his house
[2:23:20] let me ask you a question
[2:23:24] is anybody lame
[2:23:26] in this place tonight
[2:23:28] has anybody been dropped I said I wasn't
[2:23:30] going to ask you to raise your hand then
[2:23:31] I didn't I am now
[2:23:33] has anybody have been dropped in this
[2:23:34] place
[2:23:36] put your hand up if you will
[2:23:39] or you failed somewhere along the way
[2:23:41] do you feel like you you feel like the
[2:23:43] scars are
[2:23:45] you can't hide them
[2:23:49] the truth is some scars can be hidden
[2:23:51] and some are just so obvious
[2:23:54] that they can't be hidden but I want you
[2:23:56] to know there's a place there's a place
[2:23:57] where all scars can be hidden
[2:24:00] and the pain of our past can be
[2:24:01] forgotten
[2:24:03] because despite our lameness we're
[2:24:05] invited to the king's table
[2:24:07] because of a covenant that's higher
[2:24:10] that's more powerful that is eternal
[2:24:14] it's greater than the Covenant that
[2:24:16] David made with Jonathan and it's
[2:24:17] greater than the Covenant that David
[2:24:19] made with Saul
[2:24:22] it's the Covenant that Jesus made as our
[2:24:25] savior and our Messiah and he signed and
[2:24:27] sealed it with his own blood and
[2:24:30] delivered it to us in his resurrection
[2:24:33] and he not only said I want to live with
[2:24:35] you
[2:24:36] he went so far as to say I want to live
[2:24:40] in you
[2:24:43] I want to go where you go
[2:24:46] sit where you sit and walk where you
[2:24:49] walk I want a place who I am in you
[2:24:53] I want to fill you with my spirit
[2:24:57] so that you are never alone
[2:25:02] you see once mephibosheth
[2:25:05] stuck his feet under the king's table
[2:25:09] he looked like everybody else
[2:25:17] only when he got out from under the
[2:25:19] king's table that anybody knew he had a
[2:25:21] handicap
[2:25:24] so you know what my advice to you is
[2:25:26] keep your feet
[2:25:28] under his table
[2:25:30] [Applause]
[2:25:32] don't let the charms and the allures of
[2:25:35] this old world cause you to forsake
[2:25:38] Christ
[2:25:42] out there you'll be identified by where
[2:25:46] you come from and what your name is
[2:25:50] but under the king's table when you
[2:25:53] place your feet there your royalty
[2:25:57] the ground is level I wish I had some
[2:25:59] help
[2:26:00] the ground is level at the foot of the
[2:26:03] cross the rich and the poor stand side
[2:26:05] by side but broken in the hole stand
[2:26:08] side by side
[2:26:10] be educated
[2:26:13] and the uneducated
[2:26:16] stand side by side those who came from
[2:26:19] pristine lives and pristine backgrounds
[2:26:22] they stand right beside some of us in
[2:26:25] this place tonight who had parents to
[2:26:28] drop us and spouses to drop us and
[2:26:31] preachers to drop us and churches to
[2:26:34] fail us yes yet when we put our feet
[2:26:37] under the master's table
[2:26:40] there's no room to talk about where
[2:26:42] we've been
[2:26:45] or what has happened to us
[2:26:47] we're all so overwhelmed with the joy to
[2:26:50] be sitting at his table feasting
[2:26:52] continually on the bread that he
[2:26:54] provides
[2:26:56] am I making any sense at all tonight
[2:26:59] you're given an inheritance
[2:27:02] that you didn't deserve and that you
[2:27:05] didn't earn and that you could have
[2:27:06] never been worthy of
[2:27:09] but he made me Worthy
[2:27:14] and now by his grace
[2:27:17] his Mercy has made me his own
[2:27:25] you said I grew up in religion
[2:27:28] I'm not ashamed of where I come from I
[2:27:31] am who I am today because of where I
[2:27:33] walked but I grew up in religion and I
[2:27:36] grew up in quite a bit of legalism
[2:27:39] and it wasn't because we were encouraged
[2:27:42] to dress a certain way or do a certain
[2:27:45] thing I actually believe in standards
[2:27:48] and I believe if you don't have a
[2:27:49] standard and you look exactly like the
[2:27:51] rest of the world and live exactly like
[2:27:53] the rest of the world
[2:27:55] then you're not really being any kind of
[2:27:57] light at all
[2:27:58] so I believe in holiness
[2:28:01] I believe in modesty
[2:28:03] I believe in distinction between the
[2:28:05] genders
[2:28:07] you may be confused but God's not
[2:28:09] confused
[2:28:14] he knew what Plumbing to give you when
[2:28:16] he when he allowed you to be born
[2:28:19] he's not confused
[2:28:21] but I grew up in an environment where we
[2:28:24] never could quite feel Worthy
[2:28:28] and it seems like everything was
[2:28:30] designed to keep us in this state I
[2:28:33] don't think it was
[2:28:34] I think it was more ignorance than
[2:28:36] anything and lack of Revelation
[2:28:38] but it was almost like everything was
[2:28:40] designed to keep us feeling beat down
[2:28:43] and unworthy
[2:28:45] so that we would love Jesus
[2:28:48] folks that's the wrong kind of theology
[2:28:52] I've never grown in him because I
[2:28:54] realized I was unworthy what makes me
[2:28:57] grow is when I realized that he found me
[2:29:00] in my unworthiness and nothing that I
[2:29:03] could do would make me Worthy
[2:29:09] can I just get real personal
[2:29:11] you know a woman could have hair that
[2:29:13] touches the ground
[2:29:17] and she could she could have the uniform
[2:29:19] and do all the things exactly like like
[2:29:22] she should do
[2:29:24] and never even be born again
[2:29:31] because godliness doesn't start on the
[2:29:34] outside
[2:29:35] it starts on the inside
[2:29:38] [Applause]
[2:29:40] you ought to clap for that
[2:29:42] it's truth you're not coming for me it's
[2:29:45] true
[2:29:48] it's it's like I've told you and I'll
[2:29:50] I'll close here in a minute but it's
[2:29:51] like I've told you before well five
[2:29:53] minutes before the fire of God fell on
[2:29:55] the bush
[2:29:58] it was an ordinary bush
[2:30:01] Mr Bush
[2:30:03] what kind of bush a bush
[2:30:06] must have been a beautiful book it was a
[2:30:08] bush
[2:30:09] Guster bush
[2:30:11] I I I mean I
[2:30:14] it might have been an ugly bush
[2:30:19] might have been no berries no blooms
[2:30:21] hardly any leaves
[2:30:24] I just kind of think it was
[2:30:27] probably the most ordinary looking Bush
[2:30:29] on the mountain
[2:30:30] nobody would have cut it down and
[2:30:33] well you know what people do
[2:30:36] you know what heathens do
[2:30:41] nobody would have decked it out and
[2:30:43] nobody would have dug and put in a pot
[2:30:46] and made it a a
[2:30:48] house plant isn't that what they call
[2:30:50] them now house plants
[2:30:55] another trend
[2:30:58] there have been people loving plants
[2:30:59] forever and now now now they're house
[2:31:02] plants
[2:31:04] people get all excited about them I
[2:31:06] don't think this was a special bush
[2:31:09] it was a very ordinary bush
[2:31:13] but all of a sudden
[2:31:16] oh I felt that
[2:31:19] all of a sudden God God came down in the
[2:31:23] pillar of fire he had before
[2:31:26] God came down in that Pillar of Fire and
[2:31:29] you know what he did he crawled up in
[2:31:31] that bush
[2:31:35] and in in five seconds
[2:31:38] the most ordinary
[2:31:41] ugly unworthy Bush on the mountain now
[2:31:44] became a holy bush
[2:31:46] a bush that was holier than all the
[2:31:49] other bushes on that mountain
[2:31:51] why because God called in
[2:31:55] chat wow let me tell you what makes you
[2:31:58] holy
[2:32:00] it's not our actors and don'ts
[2:32:02] and we have them and we always will
[2:32:05] but it's not our do's and don'ts that
[2:32:08] make us holy
[2:32:10] it is not what we wear or we don't wear
[2:32:13] that makes us holy
[2:32:15] the thing that causes you to be holy is
[2:32:18] that God himself has chosen to live
[2:32:22] inside of you
[2:32:25] he placed more than the pillar of fire
[2:32:28] on you
[2:32:31] he rescind
[2:32:33] to what he was
[2:32:35] and he placed that he plunged that very
[2:32:38] essence
[2:32:40] into Who You Are
[2:32:44] he made you holy
[2:32:46] he made you worthy that's what the blood
[2:32:49] does
[2:32:50] that's what the life of Jesus Christ
[2:32:52] does
[2:32:54] if you believe that clap for Jesus
[2:32:57] [Applause]
[2:33:07] Hallelujah
[2:33:08] [Applause]
[2:33:10] so I want to say to you in closing
[2:33:12] we have this treasure
[2:33:15] in Earthen vessels
[2:33:18] that the Excellency of the power may be
[2:33:21] of God
[2:33:23] and not of us
[2:33:27] if he would have given us all
[2:33:30] pristine lives
[2:33:33] mamas who always did it right
[2:33:36] daddies who always did it right
[2:33:39] husbands that always nurtured us riding
[2:33:42] wives that always treated us right and
[2:33:45] pastors who always did the right thing
[2:33:47] and churches who were perfect if God
[2:33:50] would have given us all of those things
[2:33:52] we would have not appreciated fully
[2:33:56] what Mercy means
[2:34:01] what Grace means
[2:34:04] what a privilege it is
[2:34:06] did you know the Bible said you have not
[2:34:09] chosen me
[2:34:14] but I have chosen you saith the Lord
[2:34:18] he saw your scars he saw your crippled
[2:34:21] feet
[2:34:26] he saw all the things that you went
[2:34:28] through and those who carried you well
[2:34:32] and those who dropped you
[2:34:34] you are a combination a conglomeration
[2:34:38] of those who loved you well
[2:34:41] and those who loved you poorly
[2:34:44] that's who you are tonight
[2:34:49] your boasting cannot be
[2:34:53] in a beautiful
[2:34:55] life that knows no pain or no sorrow or
[2:34:58] no heartache or no betrayal
[2:35:00] your boasting cannot be anything of you
[2:35:03] of your doing
[2:35:05] of your families doing
[2:35:07] of your church is doing
[2:35:10] if you have anything to boast of tonight
[2:35:13] it must be in the one who loved you
[2:35:18] who gave everything for you and who is
[2:35:22] calling you tonight rise
[2:35:29] house
[2:35:30] the king is inviting you to place your
[2:35:33] feet under his tables
[2:35:35] you say brother you're giving altar call
[2:35:37] for Sinners not exactly I'm giving an
[2:35:40] altar call for everybody in the room
[2:35:43] whether you walk up this way or whether
[2:35:45] you don't walk up this way I want you to
[2:35:47] know it's not only those without a
[2:35:49] savior that need to realize
[2:35:52] but there are many many children of God
[2:35:55] who attend every service who pay their
[2:35:58] tithes
[2:35:59] who have never been able to reconcile
[2:36:04] the scars
[2:36:06] the betrayals the drops
[2:36:12] the years that preachers stood between
[2:36:14] you in truth
[2:36:22] across this world the pulpit is full of
[2:36:25] men who know better
[2:36:29] it'll get real quiet now
[2:36:31] but they have chosen to conceal the
[2:36:34] truth
[2:36:35] there are very few people that believe
[2:36:37] God's three people
[2:36:41] they can't read the Bible I read and
[2:36:43] think such a thing
[2:36:45] very few people believe that they know
[2:36:47] better than that
[2:36:49] they're always looking back to niacia
[2:36:51] we're not to be looking back to Nico or
[2:36:53] be we're supposed to be looking unto
[2:36:55] Jesus
[2:36:57] there was a truth of God established in
[2:37:00] the word before there was a nicean
[2:37:01] council
[2:37:02] before there was Apostles Creed there
[2:37:04] was a gospel message
[2:37:06] that delivers and sets free
[2:37:09] many churches know that the right
[2:37:11] baptism is not in the name of titles
[2:37:13] many churches know that because they're
[2:37:15] Scholars and they've studied the word
[2:37:17] but they can't afford to tell you the
[2:37:19] truth
[2:37:21] because the denomination will kick them
[2:37:23] out of the movement and they'll take
[2:37:24] their license and they won't have a
[2:37:26] Pulpit and nobody will have come
[2:37:30] there are people that are that are
[2:37:31] around this message that know the gifts
[2:37:33] are not finished
[2:37:36] they know that this message came to
[2:37:38] restore all that Pentecost was and carry
[2:37:41] us into another place in the depths of
[2:37:44] the word but it was not to take away the
[2:37:46] fire it was not to take away the spirit
[2:37:51] it was not to steal the supernatural
[2:37:54] away from us
[2:37:55] and many know it
[2:37:58] and yet they stand in the way
[2:38:01] keeping their p and I want to tell you
[2:38:02] something and I don't mean to boast
[2:38:05] but they won't preach a message like
[2:38:06] this
[2:38:07] because they wouldn't know what to deal
[2:38:09] with the mess it creates
[2:38:13] I know tonight it's going to sound
[2:38:15] boastful forgive me I know what to do I
[2:38:19] know what to do I got to put your hand
[2:38:21] in his hand that's all I got to do I
[2:38:25] can't fix you I can't heal you I can't
[2:38:27] save you I can barely help you folks but
[2:38:30] if I can put your hand in his hand I'm
[2:38:34] telling you there's a man there's a man
[2:38:36] in here
[2:38:39] there's a man in the air
[2:38:41] [Applause]
[2:38:43] who can turn on the lights
[2:38:46] and he's calling you
[2:38:48] he's calling you before Michelle
[2:38:52] to put your feet under his table
[2:38:56] whoa his table covers all the hurts all
[2:39:01] the abuse
[2:39:06] the first thing I want you to do when
[2:39:08] you get there and you settle down a
[2:39:09] little bit
[2:39:11] like David settled down
[2:39:14] and he remembered his promise
[2:39:18] I want to tell you her True Deliverance
[2:39:20] comes
[2:39:21] from those who hurt you the most
[2:39:25] when you get to the place
[2:39:28] or you can pray for them
[2:39:31] uh
[2:39:33] I don't mean them prayers
[2:39:37] you got women way too quick
[2:39:40] I want to make sure you understand that
[2:39:42] I'm not talking about them blessing
[2:39:44] bless them Lord
[2:39:47] I hope they fall off the porch and break
[2:39:49] their neck bless them Lord
[2:39:52] I know what church witchcraft is
[2:39:57] I've been around some of that Unholy
[2:39:59] intercession I don't want none of that
[2:40:02] I'll never be satisfied until they pay
[2:40:06] for what they've done thank you Jesus
[2:40:10] folks
[2:40:12] you may not be where you can relax yet
[2:40:16] you may only see your feet
[2:40:18] and how broken they are
[2:40:20] and no matter how hard you try to forget
[2:40:22] the person that dropped you they may be
[2:40:24] all you see sometime
[2:40:26] and you may not be ready to pray for
[2:40:27] them but I want to encourage you that as
[2:40:30] soon as you get to that place
[2:40:32] forgive
[2:40:34] why because he forgave us
[2:40:40] he forgave us well yeah but I didn't do
[2:40:42] anything to him you didn't
[2:40:45] you put him there
[2:40:47] I put him there don't tell me we didn't
[2:40:49] do anything to him we put him there
[2:40:51] it was not his sin he died for whoa
[2:40:55] that ought to make you shout
[2:40:57] why that ought to make a Baptist Shout
[2:41:00] that ought to make anybody Shout
[2:41:05] he went there to pay for my sin
[2:41:09] I sinned that put him there and yet he
[2:41:12] forgave me Father forgive them
[2:41:15] if he could forgive those that drove the
[2:41:17] nails in his hands and feet and thrust
[2:41:20] the crown of orange on his head somebody
[2:41:23] said oh but that's Jesus that's why
[2:41:25] you've got to understand
[2:41:27] who he is
[2:41:28] [Music]
[2:41:30] he could have called Ten Thousand Angels
[2:41:34] with one word he could have not only
[2:41:36] destroyed his enemies he could have
[2:41:37] destroyed the whole world hanging there
[2:41:40] suspended between Earth and Glory before
[2:41:42] he experienced kenosis when the spirit
[2:41:45] eternal spirit of the father left him
[2:41:47] there to die alone as the scripture
[2:41:49] tells us
[2:41:50] before that happened he could have
[2:41:52] destroyed the whole world
[2:41:55] but the prophet of the Old Testament
[2:41:57] tells us why he didn't
[2:42:00] because he saw his seed
[2:42:04] scripture says he saw his seed
[2:42:07] you know when I look across this room
[2:42:09] find something I don't know who's
[2:42:11] leading who's who's getting ready
[2:42:19] just tell me who's leading Chad who
[2:42:21] someone
[2:42:26] when I look across this room tonight I
[2:42:28] see a seed
[2:42:34] to me you're not defined
[2:42:36] by what you've been through
[2:42:40] because frankly I don't even know
[2:42:43] what all you've been through
[2:42:48] and those I do
[2:42:51] to me you're none of those things
[2:42:55] you didn't deserve them
[2:42:58] they shouldn't have happened
[2:43:01] but the only way
[2:43:05] that it could be him
[2:43:08] and not some goodness on our part
[2:43:12] we had to wait our way through some
[2:43:13] stuff
[2:43:16] we had to experience some Darkness
[2:43:20] we had to carry a little bit of pain
[2:43:23] none of it compares to his suffering on
[2:43:25] our behalf
[2:43:27] and he's calling for you tonight
[2:43:32] whether you consider yourself in Christ
[2:43:35] are not yet in Christ

[2:43:56] drink his water
[2:43:58] and see what love can accomplish
[2:44:00] many of us need Deliverance
[2:44:03] because we have become the manifestation
[2:44:06] of our pain
[2:44:08] and we're living the reality of what
[2:44:11] we've been through instead of living a
[2:44:13] life of Victory and freedom and
[2:44:14] deliverance but he has power to deliver
[2:44:16] us tonight you don't need to fall on the
[2:44:19] ground you don't have to have somebody
[2:44:21] lay hands on your head all you have to
[2:44:23] do is believe that he's able to do what
[2:44:26] I've preached he could do tonight
[2:44:27] all it takes to have that kind of help
[2:44:30] and that kind of touch is to reach out

[3:16:41] and here's what I want to say to the
[3:16:43] enemy
[3:16:44] they're still walking
[3:16:46] they're not whole yet but they're still
[3:16:48] walking

[3:16:56] until it's finalized

[3:17:05] that she has once known
[3:17:08] to that simple Trust
[3:17:12] in the name of Jesus I pray
[3:17:15] that her feet will find their place
[3:17:18] under your table that her mouth
[3:17:21] will eat your bread and that she will
[3:17:24] drink your water
[3:17:26] it is life for her family it is life for
[3:17:30] her
[3:17:32] in the name of Jesus
[3:17:36] praise God
[3:17:38] praise God
[3:17:40] praise God
[3:17:41] we didn't come that far enough to get a
[3:17:43] little touch from the Lord
[3:17:45] we've made a big sacrifice to be here
[3:17:49] oh sorry brother
[3:17:53] my understanding is that you were uh at
[3:17:57] uh what you call your grandmother
[3:18:00] a house what do you call her what do you
[3:18:01] call Sister Nana if you were there with
[3:18:04] your family and you saw a stream you saw
[3:18:06] part of a stream of our service do you
[3:18:08] remember that and did you I think they
[3:18:10] told me you wanted to know why you'd
[3:18:12] never visited this church or why you
[3:18:14] never knew about this church and you
[3:18:16] wanted to come and the enemy tried to
[3:18:17] talk you out of it and you kind of lost
[3:18:20] the desire to be here but somehow you
[3:18:22] made it and I knew the first time I
[3:18:24] looked at you that you were supposed to
[3:18:25] be here for a reason for a reason
[3:18:26] purpose and you did too so let's just
[3:18:28] ask the Lord to reveal that purpose in
[3:18:30] your life
[3:18:31] Hallelujah
[3:18:34] father in the name of Jesus
[3:18:37] Lord you see this precious young man
[3:18:40] far too precious for the filthy world
[3:18:43] around him
[3:18:46] far too valuable for the filthy world
[3:18:49] around him
[3:18:51] I pray o God that right now you will
[3:18:54] come to take and claim what is yours
[3:18:58] saw him before the foundation of the
[3:19:01] world
[3:19:02] before he was formed in his mother's
[3:19:04] womb he was yours
[3:19:07] you had a purpose for his life
[3:19:11] and you brought him this place not by
[3:19:13] accident but to show him who you are
[3:19:16] I pray tonight that every wound every
[3:19:18] scar
[3:19:21] those moments of rejection those moments
[3:19:25] of feeling failed and let down
[3:19:29] those moments of feeling not as
[3:19:31] important as someone or something else
[3:19:36] those times of even being brushed aside
[3:19:42] I pray tonight they land under your
[3:19:44] table
[3:19:46] because that is not who he is
[3:19:48] in the name of Jesus
[3:19:51] let your blood redeem this life
[3:19:55] and use him for the kingdom of God
[3:19:59] consume him with a desire
[3:20:02] for the things of God
[3:20:05] may his life never be the same again
[3:20:13] Jesus come in come in right now Lord ask
[3:20:18] him little brother just say Jesus come
[3:20:20] in come into my life
[3:20:23] fill me with who you are

[3:20:28] go the rest of the way fill me
[3:20:31] with who you are
[3:20:33] may she never be the same
[3:20:36] May the things of this world lose their
[3:20:40] value may they they dim in his vision
[3:20:44] may he have a desire for the things of
[3:20:47] God
[3:20:48] may he be used for his own family
[3:20:52] I know that's a heavy weight to lay on
[3:20:54] you but I didn't do it
[3:20:58] you were born for such a purpose
[3:21:03] the only joy in life is yielding to your
[3:21:06] purpose
[3:21:07] to what God has called you for
[3:21:10] [Music]
