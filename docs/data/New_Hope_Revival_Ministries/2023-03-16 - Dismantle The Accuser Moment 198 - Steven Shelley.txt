Description:
“I saw strategic prayers, prayers that called and pleaded the case before the Ancient of Days, the righteous judge of all. And it came in such a way that the judge could not help, he could not refuse the petition because the petition was made based on the blood. There’s no higher price than the blood of Jesus.“

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's hot time that we made it right before God you could shut down your accuser the enemy your adversary is standing against you and heriting what rightfully belongs to you he doesn't need it for himself he just wants to dispossess you remember he's the klepties the thief the one who steals not he steals for the thrill of stealing your adversary will steal your joy having no need of your joy but knowing that you have a legal right to it he places himself between you and your joy so you've got to move him out of the way you have to dispossess him before he dispossesses you you've got to dismantle him before he dismantles you you've got to steal his rights his right of accusation before he destroys you with his accusation in the spirit I begin to see prayers were being offered and I don't mean now I lay me down to sleep prayers it's all right that's good prayer do it but I mean strategic prayers prayers that called and pleaded the case before the Ancient of Days the righteous judge of all it came in such a way that that judge could not help he he could not refuse the petition because the petition was made based on the blood there's no higher price than the blood of Jesus because all this arguing that goes on in the courtroom of Eternity all this arguing and going on and the enemy standing there making his case about why you don't deserve and then and some of what he says is true and that's why you and I have a responsibility keep the dead cats off the line and walk in a state of repentance and I want to tell you something if you struggle with saying you're sorry you got bigger problems than that it's hot time that we made it right before God you could shut down your accuser you you could cause him to have to stand speedless speechless before the judge because there's nothing else to be said because you've repented and you've cried out to God and you've gone to your brother and you've gone to your sister and you've gotten it right and so now he just the judge says what is the accusation and normally the great sophist would just open his mouth and he would just begin to eloquently spew out all the things that you did wrong the way you didn't treat your wife right the way you didn't treat your children right the way you cheated on your job the way you took the stapler home that didn't belong to you but now it's all been made right it's all been confessed and the blood you'd be surprised what the blood calls into the courtroom that blood is pleaded when the great defense attorney of all times there is no argument he never has to argue on all he has to do is plead the there is no accusation that can stand against the power of the blood of Jesus Christ by the blood of the lamb and by the word of my testimony
