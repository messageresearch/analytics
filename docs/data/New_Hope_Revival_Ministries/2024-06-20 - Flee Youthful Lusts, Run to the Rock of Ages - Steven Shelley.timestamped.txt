[0:00] but how many of you believe it's very
[0:02] possible for a young man to grow up in
[0:04] faith to have a real genuine experience
[0:07] with God to be born again as a child
[0:11] filled with the Holy Ghost and stay in
[0:14] the word now I'm not an example for all
[0:17] things that's what my life was he filled
[0:21] me with the Holy Ghost when I was seven
[0:22] years old I want you to know it made a
[0:25] difference in my life it didn't always
[0:28] make me right it didn't mean always did
[0:30] the right thing but it meant I always
[0:32] knew where to come back to I always knew
[0:35] where to look to and so to me my
[0:38] testimony is not like yours but I'm
[0:40] going to hold it up we needed God when
[0:43] we breathed our first
[0:44] breath but there's no reason for us to
[0:47] think that a young man can't flee
[0:50] youthful lust he can when he's full of
[0:54] the Holy Ghost and he must Paul was sure
[0:57] about it this is still good advice in
[1:00] our generation we live in a sensual
[1:02] idolatrous money-loving lustful Society
[1:06] every device the devil can use he'll do
[1:08] to subvert a soul we have to flee and
[1:11] that doesn't mean crawl
[1:13] away it means run away like you're
[1:16] fleeing a bear like you're fleeing a
[1:19] serpent like you're fleeing a hungry
[1:21] lion run remember we're not just fleeing
[1:25] from something but we're fleeing to
[1:29] something we're running to the Rock of
[1:31] Ages the men in this church and fathers
[1:35] in this church and husbands in this
[1:37] church who are successful in their life
[1:40] they're not just running from the devil
[1:42] they're running to the Rock of Ages
[1:44] they're running to the rock that will
[1:46] never fail them you believe that they're
[1:50] running to the rock that was split on
[1:53] their behalf Rock of Ages cleft for me
[1:58] there are some things we ought to be
[1:59] with to fight for in our generation
[2:01] fight for your own personal identity as
[2:03] a man fight the battle for personal
[2:06] Holiness fight the battle for your
[2:08] family fight through the pain of living
[2:10] in a fallen world fight for some close
[2:12] Godly friends fight to have a strong
[2:16] faith when asking what does a man of God
[2:19] look like perhaps the best way to
[2:21] summarize what a Godly Man looks like
[2:24] according to the Bible is is with these
[2:26] words sacrificial love
[2:30] yes do what you do act like men do what
[2:34] you do with Love by love
