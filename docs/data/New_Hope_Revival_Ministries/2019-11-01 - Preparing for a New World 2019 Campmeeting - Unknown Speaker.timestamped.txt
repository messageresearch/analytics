[14:25] God's grace he I know you some of us
[14:28] know he's really real you know we're not
[14:32] just serving a God that his that is
[14:35] proven himself in this age but he's also
[14:38] bore witness within us
[14:41] you got to know him personally and know
[14:45] that he is alive and well and that the
[14:49] God that we serve is still alive you
[14:54] know we come and we worship we shout and

[15:09] there's a life to live and I hope and
[15:15] trust by God's grace he will bless you
[15:19] in a special way through the word
[15:22] tonight starting beginning beginning at
[15:26] the first verse let not your heart be
[15:29] troubled he believed in God believe also
[15:34] in me in my father's house are many
[15:38] mansions if it were not so I would have
[15:43] told you I go to prepare a place for you
[15:47] and if I go prepare a place for you I
[15:51] will come again and receive you unto
[15:53] myself that where I am there you may be
[15:57] also
[15:58] and whether I go you know and the way
[16:01] you know and Thomas said unto Him Lord
[16:04] we know not whither thou goest and how
[16:07] can we know the way and jesus said unto
[16:11] him I am the way the truth and the life
[16:14] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[16:18] if you have known me you should have
[16:21] known my father also and from his fourth
[16:24] you know him and have seen him
[16:27] and Philip said unto Him Lord show us
[16:30] the father and it suffice as us and
[16:33] Jesus said unto Him have I been so long
[16:36] time with you and yet as thou not known
[16:39] me Philip he that have seen me have seen
[16:43] the father and have said how saith thou
[16:46] then show us the father believe it
[16:49] though not that I am in the father and
[16:53] the father in me
[16:55] the words that I speak unto you I speak
[16:57] not of myself but the father that
[17:00] dwelleth in me he dwelleth do what the
[17:03] works gives me believe me that I am in
[17:06] the father and the father in me or else
[17:09] believe me for the very works sake
[17:12] verily verily I say unto you he that
[17:15] believeth on me the works that I do
[17:18] shall he do also and greater works than
[17:21] these shall he do because I go unto my
[17:24] father and whatever you ask in my name
[17:28] that I will do that the father may be
[17:32] glorified in the son and if ye shall ask
[17:36] anything in my name I will do it one
[17:41] more scripture please I know that's a
[17:43] long one but Isaiah 55 and 11
[18:01] you
[18:05] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[18:08] of my mouth it shall not return unto me
[18:13] void but it shall accomplish that which
[18:16] I please and it shall prosper in the
[18:20] things whether - I sent it
[18:22] let us pray father we come before you
[18:27] and we thank you for your grace and your
[18:30] mercy we thank you for being so good to
[18:34] us
[18:35] you have been better to us than we have
[18:38] been to ourselves there are no words to
[18:41] express our gratitude Father we thank
[18:44] you Jesus
[18:46] break every yoke tonight destroy the
[18:49] works of the enemy Lord and I pray
[18:51] father God that the word spoken may find
[18:54] good place in good rest in the heart of
[18:57] your people
[18:58] grant it dear Jesus and your lovely name
[19:00] Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be
[19:04] seated I like to entitle this message
[19:13] preparing for a new world when we see by
[19:24] God's grace the writings of John here
[19:30] the prophet of God tells us that it was
[19:32] almost like Jesus was speaking its own
[19:36] funeral service and the thing that I
[19:42] like about what I'm reading is because
[19:46] he said that he was going to prepare a
[19:48] place for us and when I think about this
[19:55] I think about what caused this to happen
[20:00] and you and I must understand that we
[20:04] must go back to Genesis often time to
[20:06] find out the reality of what's really
[20:10] happening we're living in the last days
[20:16] and you and I know that this world is
[20:18] falling apart come on somebody it's
[20:22] worse now than it's ever been
[20:25] how are we going to escape when we see
[20:30] maniacs ready to push the button how are
[20:37] we going to get out of this world but
[20:41] then the Lord began to minister to me
[20:44] and he took me back to Genesis and he
[20:48] showed me that God had given Adam a
[20:51] commission and God told Adam be fruitful
[20:56] and multiply and you and I know that
[21:01] Adam really never did what God said do
[21:06] that alright what had happened we find
[21:10] out that because of sin instead of the
[21:15] sons of God multiply we found out that
[21:19] it was the serpent who filled the earth
[21:23] is that right hallelujah as you said
[21:27] what problems how do you know because
[21:30] the Bible tells us that they married and
[21:34] we're given to marriage they multiply
[21:37] and violence covered the earth
[21:42] and as it was is that day so is it in
[21:47] this day is that right you now must
[21:51] understand that the multitude of people
[21:55] that was drowned in the flood was not
[21:59] the seed of God made a translation
[22:14] hallelujah you ever thought about it
[22:17] what was it that God preserved Enoch
[22:21] what was it that God took eat up off
[22:25] this earth and where did he go there's
[22:29] got to be a place he knock is not
[22:34] floating around in the atmosphere
[22:36] somewhere but place and you and I must
[22:43] understand that there are other worlds
[22:49] hallelujah we may call them dimensional
[22:55] but they're there so we realized by
[23:00] God's grace that God began to do a work
[23:04] and Satan always look like he's the
[23:10] winner but every real seed of God has a
[23:14] place a preserve a preserved place when
[23:20] we leave here we go to a designated
[23:23] place that God has preserved you say
[23:27] what do you mean remember the Bible said
[23:30] God word will not come back void
[23:34] hallelujah and though we bypass our
[23:38] theophany hello when God made out of he
[23:44] made all of us
[23:45] come on somebody with the proper God
[23:49] went behind the curtain of time and he
[23:51] saw all of us
[23:52] you just didn't appear there you were
[23:57] there honey so you say what do you mean
[24:02] brother Bruce I'm trying to get us to
[24:04] see that there is a place that God has
[24:09] already prepared for us is that right
[24:13] all of the newcomers everybody that has
[24:18] the a body there must come this way is
[24:25] that right you and I must suffer we
[24:29] don't like suffering but that's what
[24:32] Adam did to us see cuz he was deceiving
[24:35] Adam was in the transgression right so
[24:39] you said what do you mean this is why
[24:41] when we come into the world the woman
[24:44] when she have a child it drops because
[24:47] it's a sign of the fall it drops but
[24:51] when God Amen created Adam and Eve they
[24:54] stood up like trees somebody help me
[24:57] here they stood up right hallelujah and
[25:01] we find out that God's grace because of
[25:05] the fall hallelujah we had the Bob pass
[25:08] out the army and we're now being born
[25:12] into this beast
[25:15] we got Beasley bodies come out somebody
[25:18] if you don't know your body is a beast
[25:21] something's wrong with you and they
[25:23] always think that contains the Beast
[25:25] is the Holy Ghost
[25:27] [Applause]
[25:30] hallelujah this is why I try to tell
[25:32] people we're not just in an age of
[25:35] shouting and dancing and running and all
[25:38] those is good don't get me wrong I know
[25:40] sometimes people want to cut all that
[25:42] out I'm not saying that but I'm saying
[25:44] there you got to mature you got a mature
[25:50] let me let me read something here amen
[25:53] listen we understand no the new city
[26:01] according to revelation 21 the Bible
[26:04] says and there shall in no wise enter
[26:07] into it any thing that defileth neither
[26:12] whatsoever that worketh abomination or
[26:15] make it a lie but they which are written
[26:18] in the Lamb's Book of Life is our
[26:23] brother what are you trying to say don't
[26:26] you understand that even when Jesus come
[26:29] again
[26:30] his feet cannot touch the earth
[26:34] hallelujah and therefore when we are
[26:37] changed we must leave the earth why
[26:43] because we will be in our glorified
[26:45] bodies we will be in the image of the
[26:49] world that is to come
[26:51] wait a minute somebody see in heaven you
[26:54] won't need supernatural because you are
[26:58] supernatural and that right but you must
[27:02] understand in this world you must have
[27:05] faith and come to know the supernatural
[27:09] and the only way you'll know the
[27:12] supernatural is that you must be born
[27:14] supernatural
[27:16] somebody help me here see I'm preparing
[27:20] I'm preparing for the New World
[27:24] I'm gonna come back to that in just a
[27:27] moment you know how it is when you're in
[27:30] your mother's womb you may have married
[27:33] me say this before I don't know but when
[27:35] you and your mother's wound that baby
[27:37] don't have to eat what was it what a
[27:40] baby why is it forming a mouth why is it
[27:44] forming a hand these hands why are the
[27:49] babies in the womb the baby doesn't need
[27:50] these hands the baby doesn't need its
[27:53] feet come on somebody the day the baby
[27:58] in the womb the baby don't even need its
[28:00] lungs because the baby lives after
[28:07] mother's lungs the mother's breathing
[28:10] the mother's eating everything the
[28:15] mother the baby needs the mother gives
[28:17] it but you see that baby is not formed
[28:21] in that womb to remain there to remain
[28:33] here when you and I can see that this is
[28:43] why amen God told Nicodemus you must be
[28:48] born again that which is flesh is flesh
[28:52] and that which is spirit is spirit
[28:58] and never in the history of time where
[29:04] we have come to know the divine nature
[29:09] of God we thought and many of us we've
[29:15] been in all kinds of churches out on
[29:17] been in every branch there is but you
[29:23] know the thing is we we learn what they
[29:25] teach us and here there's another thirst
[29:30] hallelujah I've seen all kinds of
[29:33] miracles but there was something what
[29:44] was it that was that election oh come on
[29:48] somebody say let me tell you some
[29:50] you can't even thirst for God unless God
[29:53] has chosen you to thirst hallelujah see
[30:01] I'm coming I always tell people I said
[30:03] you better take this week because the
[30:04] better coming hallelujah
[30:09] so you that must understand by God's
[30:12] grace amen that we're not here to be
[30:15] ordinary people the whole creation grows
[30:23] and waits
[30:26] it didn't say for the sons of God to
[30:28] come it said the manifestations
[30:32] hallelujah you and I must understand
[30:36] what God did to Malachi for was a wave
[30:38] that means war to come
[30:42] hallelujah all unite must be able to
[30:46] identify with being one of them see the
[30:52] devil is afraid that you're going to
[30:54] come to understand who you are
[31:00] hallelujah you I'll tell the devil you
[31:03] can't stop me I was here before you were
[31:14] you must arrive oh it's only to bring me
[31:21] to a proving ground you and I must prove
[31:25] that we're not from satan's either and
[31:28] we have come to live the life that the
[31:32] Baptist the methods the pillar Coster
[31:34] all could not live come on somebody
[31:41] we're moving upward and this why try to
[31:45] tell people I said don't you realize
[31:47] what the devil is doing this is the age
[31:50] of distractions he's distracting us
[31:55] because he's trying to keep us away from
[31:58] what we are supposed to do but you and I
[32:03] know nothing absolutely nothing can stop
[32:08] the purpose of God
[32:13] and I'm one of them I don't care what I
[32:17] got to go through I am born giant-slayer
[32:21] come on somebody you are not and you say
[32:25] what do you mean I come to be a blessing
[32:27] but I want you to understand you can't
[32:29] just sit still and not grow in God when
[32:36] when in the 3rd chapter of Revelation go
[32:39] tried in the fire we want the goal but
[32:43] we don't want to be tried hallelujah but
[32:48] you and I must understand you're being
[32:50] tried in the fire
[32:51] you are the deity of God and you must
[32:54] God must purge all of the darkness out
[32:59] of you come on somebody show you some Oh
[33:03] what do you mean brother I'm saying you
[33:05] and I must die and rot that is the law
[33:11] of life remember now
[33:18] if we had not fallen by way of sin it
[33:23] would have been a spoken word events
[33:26] hallelujah come on somebody see because
[33:29] you got to understand and I noticed my
[33:31] soundless strength but it was a man God
[33:34] spoke to Adam and told Adam before Eve
[33:37] was ever manifested be fruitful and
[33:40] multiply it was out of that felt
[33:46] loneliness that was afterwards got an
[33:50] already told Adam to be fruitful and
[33:53] multiply so God brought a companion
[33:57] somebody help me here and she brought
[34:01] took away the loneliness but God had a
[34:05] man that would speak the word
[34:10] you said bring that to the word because
[34:13] listen you and I'm not being born by a
[34:16] church we are being born by Christ Jesus
[34:24] Christ
[34:28] see you and I must understand by God's
[34:31] grace what we're moving into we must be
[34:35] like him there's no sin to it
[34:38] and if that real seed is in you the
[34:42] devil he don't want you to be you don't
[34:44] want that seed to be quickened because
[34:47] once that seed is quicker it's all over
[34:51] because when the seed is quickened
[34:54] God said that he will complete the work
[34:58] [Music]
[35:13] somebody help me and even though we
[35:19] don't have patience with God God has a
[35:22] lot of patience with us hallelujah you
[35:28] love the Lord you and I we must
[35:32] understand when God told Adam coming
[35:34] back to that to replenish and look at
[35:37] all oh that happened even God beyond
[35:41] flooded the world with north I mean in
[35:43] Noah's day the world and then he comes
[35:46] along and then God raise up a nation
[35:48] under in Egypt Israel raise them up
[35:52] right we glorify God look at all
[35:57] millions millions come out of Egypt and
[36:03] then two of that generation crosses over
[36:11] how many in your church somebody better
[36:17] help me here see what we fail to see it
[36:20] will only be a few and you need to make
[36:23] sure you one of the few if this all
[36:27] right I'll tell people I said listen I
[36:30] don't know about what everybody else is
[36:31] doing
[36:32] that ain't my business hallelujah I need
[36:36] to know who I am when you come to know
[36:40] who you are you become invincible in God
[36:45] nobody can put you inside and nobody can
[36:48] take you out how could I said we are
[36:57] family family I will show you because
[37:03] even the Bible says in the fifth chapter
[37:05] of Genesis that Adams named Adam some
[37:08] light
[37:09] he created their name then their name
[37:11] was Adam and you understand the Bible
[37:14] says the whole family of heaven and
[37:15] earth his name after him now Adam was
[37:18] the first Adam you're right before the
[37:22] fall when God would say Adam they both
[37:25] would turn yes Lord
[37:28] [Music]
[37:30] right
[37:31] they were so connected by oneness and
[37:35] character they answered God the same way
[37:38] is that right y'all know Heidi at some
[37:42] time husband and wives when you've been
[37:44] mad at us a long time you begin to think
[37:46] alike you begin to say things alike
[37:47] sometimes your expressions becomes the
[37:49] same because you you you you feed off of
[37:52] each other and Adam and Eve they were
[37:55] just the same so he the scripture says
[38:01] let this mind be in you that was also in
[38:07] Christ Jesus who thought it not robbery
[38:11] to be equal with God
[38:15] and that's where we're falling shot
[38:19] y'all hear me that's what we're falling
[38:23] shot we want to be underneath him but if
[38:26] you in Jesus you must not think it
[38:30] robbery to be equal with God the Holy
[38:36] Ghost will teach you that you not don't
[38:39] have a second person or third person but
[38:41] the person in you which is God himself
[38:46] and even God in you just to give an
[38:50] analysis if I had a coke bottle right oh
[38:55] there's water bottle and water is in
[38:58] here it becomes a water bottle but if I
[39:03] had Pepsi in here it changes the
[39:09] identity of the bottle hallelujah you
[39:13] say could you pass me that Pepsi
[39:16] somebody help me sheesh oh you gotta
[39:19] understand this is what I preach let me
[39:22] say it like this
[39:23] it must be the same it must be the same
[39:28] and you and I know what the same is is
[39:33] that right when we were in elementary
[39:35] they had wagons sometimes cars and they
[39:40] would all look like what would have
[39:43] maybe three wheels and one might have
[39:45] four wheels and then you might have one
[39:48] with four wheels and one blue and one
[39:50] red but you need to find the one that
[39:53] looked exactly like the other hallelujah
[39:57] and you would draw a circle to identify
[40:02] the very same right they could be shaped
[40:05] alike they could look just alike almost
[40:08] but there was always one difference that
[40:11] made the difference and you had the
[40:14] circle the ones that were the exact same
[40:20] now I want you to look at yourself and I
[40:25] want you to think about what they were
[40:27] after are you the same because only the
[40:39] same goes up oh Jesus but you're not he
[41:06] said I want you the widest supplicant
[41:08] you look so pretty and everything else
[41:10] but inside your dad miss balls that's
[41:13] not what God wants you've got to be
[41:17] spirit filled I didn't say half filled
[41:22] I didn't say 99% filled I said you got
[41:25] to be spirit filled the Bible said they
[41:28] were full of the Holy Ghost
[41:30] Oh somebody help me here because God
[41:38] that in the new world there will not be
[41:41] one serpent in that new city nothing
[41:49] that will defile hallelujah and you're
[41:53] looking show up revolution
[41:54] when Peter look at Peter God told Peter
[41:57] I give you the keys right and we go to
[42:01] ash 238 is that is that all that Peter
[42:03] gave us Peter can't come right around
[42:06] and says listen I'm gonna tell you
[42:09] something about the divine nature of God
[42:12] and God is gonna make a way of entrance
[42:16] hallelujah
[42:18] you see because I want you to understand
[42:20] without these keys the doors of heaven
[42:23] will not open for you
[42:26] see those nature that long-suffering
[42:29] that patience that that you know
[42:32] godliness all of those things must be
[42:35] sealed only inside to make a rapture
[42:41] [Music]
[42:42] hallelujah so when God is bringing you
[42:45] through a trial you don't cry out why me
[42:47] Lord you say thank you how you give
[42:54] thanks in all things give things
[42:59] [Applause]
[43:01] hallelujah is that right
[43:04] see if you're not careful that's the
[43:06] difference between Joshua and Caleb they
[43:08] always had a good spirit but those
[43:11] authors who followed Moses Marvin and
[43:15] complain all the time the Holy Ghost
[43:23] thing gonna let you do that and get away
[43:26] with it huh the Holy Ghost will make you
[43:30] repent every time you speak something
[43:34] negative out of your mouth the Holy
[43:36] Ghost will check you is that right
[43:42] somebody was asking me several
[43:44] Brotherhood's what are you saying what
[43:45] are you what are you preaching cuz I was
[43:48] just dealing with a few things of
[43:50] physics his eyes line talks about
[43:52] relativity and and things like that and
[43:54] you know how how two objects can exist
[44:00] but yet be in a different place but on
[44:03] the same line right because we are
[44:08] reflections did y'all know that did you
[44:14] know that that that that that Judas
[44:18] Judas was somewhere before he got here
[44:23] he was the son of perdition he was
[44:26] somewhere else before he came here
[44:29] whether be by thought or not he was
[44:32] there because when he died and hung
[44:34] himself
[44:35] on the tree he went back to where he
[44:37] came from and Jesus was somewhere before
[44:41] he got here right and when he died he
[44:44] went back to where he came from and the
[44:48] word tells us that only ones who will
[44:51] receive are those who descended somebody
[44:56] help me that's why we can say I came
[45:00] from God and I go back to God right I'm
[45:07] not talking to church people we got a
[45:09] lot of church folks that love Church
[45:11] they come to church they love it they
[45:12] love it like people are clubs they do
[45:17] they do but we're not talking when we
[45:19] were working with with with with
[45:21] understanding that you said I got faith
[45:26] but faith is operated by love and you
[45:30] got to understand that if you have faith
[45:32] in God you must love God you understand
[45:36] me now the Bible tells us that if we ask
[45:38] anything of God and believe it here
[45:43] giving give it to us right but you gotta
[45:46] also also understand I'm talking like
[45:49] this because I feel like I'm at home I
[45:50] want you to understand that when it
[45:52] comes to understanding what God is doing
[45:55] in you if you understand it it will
[45:58] change your whole perspective about what
[46:00] God is doing no temptation has taken you
[46:07] except those that are coming to me take
[46:13] Joel for an example the Bible said Joel
[46:15] was a perfect man but job had to suffer
[46:19] in order for God to take job where he
[46:24] should be and understand that's the
[46:26] oldest book of the Bible
[46:28] so Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[46:31] and forever he's a God that changes not
[46:34] however he dealt with Joel God deals
[46:39] with us the same way
[46:42] he blesses us and we love those
[46:45] blessings but we can hardly take it when
[46:49] the when when the battles come you know
[46:52] I mean even Joe wonder was he was he
[46:54] cursed at my cursor something going on
[46:56] here you know what I mean but we fail to
[46:58] see the hands of God is perfecting you
[47:01] think about what you might have within
[47:04] yourself that you hate
[47:06] don't you want God to get it out of
[47:08] there and sometimes you know we don't
[47:10] know how to get it out right like I tell
[47:14] people I said I can wash my hands I can
[47:16] wash my feet I might even be here to get
[47:18] a brush and wash my back but only God
[47:20] can wash my heart and I need God the
[47:24] supernatural to go in there and clean
[47:27] everything out of me right that's not
[47:32] that's just the beginning
[47:33] once he's sanctifying cleanses you
[47:35] without all that stuff this is what God
[47:38] did he begin to put his virtues and
[47:40] guess what that's a victory
[47:43] he ain't gonna pull you through no hope
[47:46] you got a battle hallelujah now you say
[47:52] well what do you mean brother just a
[47:53] moment I don't skipped all over my
[47:55] little nose but that's okay I want you
[47:57] to understand I'm trying to get
[47:58] something over just so you can know that
[48:01] that you're preparing it's like when
[48:05] you're going on a trip you know we pack
[48:07] up but we're not packing up to not not
[48:10] natural things but we want the virtues
[48:12] to pack up in us and you and I must
[48:15] understand that one way when when when
[48:18] God is working with us no matter who you
[48:21] are if you're true seed you're gonna
[48:23] have to go through some things
[48:25] hallelujah you're gonna have to go
[48:27] there's various things he went through
[48:29] sometimes you got to go through being
[48:31] embarrassed and ashamed
[48:34] yeah the devil got it for you you're
[48:38] gonna have to you don't be below
[48:40] suffering and patient and all of those
[48:42] things even when you know you're right
[48:45] wait a minute even when you know you're
[48:49] right
[48:52] huh well I'm right but being right is
[48:56] not always righteous huh
[49:00] sometimes you really do have to give up
[49:02] the right for the wrong I often tell
[49:05] brothers where's the scripture said you
[49:07] know men who suffer themselves to be
[49:09] defrauded but no they owe me an apology
[49:12] how many apologies you Oh God okay let
[49:16] me move on move on because I'm trying to
[49:18] get us to see by God's grace that he's
[49:22] working on us working working on us
[49:27] following us fastening us into his very
[49:30] image and I'm gonna tell you something
[49:33] I'm not the same man I used to be ten
[49:35] years ago but it's been worth it why cuz
[49:49] I know where I'm going y'all understand
[49:53] me I know where I came from I like like
[49:56] the probably God says I can't be a devil
[49:58] I love him too much is he yours
[50:09] I'm gonna go back to the reflection
[50:11] because whatever you are reflecting here
[50:14] is what you reflecting there or
[50:17] elsewhere is that right you know a
[50:21] shadow and and the object is so close to
[50:24] each other you can't really separate
[50:27] them then after a while the shadow in
[50:29] the object becomes the same thing
[50:31] hallelujah
[50:32] you're not gonna have the shadow of a
[50:34] burden and you get up on the object and
[50:36] it's it's a snake
[50:38] it is reflecting right it's reflecting
[50:43] whatever that light is striking right
[50:47] it's like this you you said oh I see
[50:49] this no not really scientifically you
[50:52] don't see this you see the reflection of
[50:54] it and let me ask you do you realize
[50:58] that this thing is moving but your eyes
[51:01] can't see it and don't you know its grab
[51:05] that keeps it in place if gravity wasn't
[51:08] here you know what would happen to us we
[51:10] were just going into pieces but what
[51:13] happened is when God said let there be
[51:15] light
[51:16] that vibration went out and it held
[51:18] everything he needs to hold in place
[51:20] right so you say well what do you mean
[51:23] brother let me tell you something those
[51:26] stars that God lined up out there it's
[51:30] still there because God in the person of
[51:35] the low God says stop and it stopped
[51:40] even the atmosphere everything has its
[51:44] boundaries and so do you
[51:46] you've got your boundaries hallelujah
[51:51] God didn't make us all doctors neither
[51:56] did he all make us all surgeons or piano
[51:59] players or and I wonder ham how did God
[52:02] know he's such a mastermind he knew how
[52:05] many piano players to put it in this
[52:09] world come on he knew how many scenes to
[52:12] put in this world oh come on
[52:19] every one of us with the talents that we
[52:22] have has been given to us by God so let
[52:26] me say it like this every good and
[52:27] perfect gift comes from God and only
[52:33] those gifts will remain of you when God
[52:38] gets done only the gifts that he's given
[52:41] you will remain and everything else will
[52:44] be Jesus hallelujah you love the Lord no
[52:56] it's true yo yo yo yo yo yo your
[53:02] thoughts ringing louder in heaven then
[53:05] your words you said well how can that
[53:07] because it's dimensional you don't even
[53:10] know that your dimensional right but you
[53:14] are hallelujah
[53:18] he said oh brother was what are you
[53:19] saying I'm trying to tell you you have a
[53:21] representation we call it a theophany
[53:24] right but you here on earth Jesus said
[53:28] to those disciples he said the Pharisees
[53:30] let me tell you something I can tell you
[53:32] something you give me the answer is how
[53:34] can the Son of Man be here on earth and
[53:35] in heaven at the same time you are doing
[53:43] heavenly things
[53:45] somebody help me they teach us how to
[53:49] pray our Father who art in heaven
[53:51] hallowed be thy name right that will be
[53:55] done as it is in heaven let me do let me
[54:01] do it let me have it done him hallelujah
[54:12] he said I'll tell you what I was laying
[54:15] on the bed and he says all of a sudden I
[54:19] found myself above my body I was looking
[54:23] down at an old man but on this side I
[54:25] was young I'm a young man
[54:36] oh come on somebody Jasha and what
[54:40] happens is that when you hear this
[54:43] message and you quicken your theophany
[54:47] is now pulling you together
[54:49] it's preaching to you is literally
[54:52] telling you don't do this don't do that
[54:54] it's bringing you revelations hallelujah
[54:57] he's the one that warns you when the
[55:00] devil comes out to you hallelujah
[55:05] I try to tell people yeah we got to grow
[55:08] David was anointed king and when he was
[55:13] a noted king he was king
[55:15] [Music]
[55:17] he had to grow up but he still was king
[55:20] you bribed you might have to grow up but
[55:25] you still bribed somebody help me so you
[55:29] can understand guess what we often
[55:40] thought when he said I go to prepare a
[55:43] place for you
[55:44] you don't mean I thought we're gonna
[55:45] have all these mansions there times I
[55:47] thought which one I'm gonna what kind
[55:49] I'm gonna have you know and I always say
[55:52] Lord you know you got to give me a
[55:54] mountain somewhere and some running
[55:57] water I love both of them I love that
[56:02] that when they come together like that
[56:03] right I said Lord but then I found out
[56:06] that the mansion though there'll be
[56:08] places buildings and all but you are the
[56:12] mansion
[56:14] you are the mansion and guess what you
[56:18] cannot be an incomplete mansion and go
[56:22] there hallelujah you understand me god
[56:27] no I could not go in or the rain could
[56:30] not solve until Noah's Ark was completed
[56:35] and that represents us God keep bringing
[56:40] rapture until you and I are completed
[56:44] and guess what God will not have to
[56:48] scratch his head and says I wonder is it
[56:50] done yet oh absolutely not
[56:52] you and I would be so much like him and
[56:55] I'm pushing toward that yes I am I'm
[56:59] pushing too hard that I want to be just
[57:01] like him I don't care if you called me
[57:04] Holy Roller you call me whatever you
[57:07] want to call me you know I think

[57:18] praying I don't care sometimes that's
[57:21] what I find find my way of escape just
[57:23] getting down there and just crying out
[57:25] to the Lord hallelujah let me say it so

[1:03:58] David like I said it's daddy didn't even
[1:04:01] want to own up to him Sammy said surely
[1:04:04] you got another one and we would not
[1:04:06] have known him probably God not told us
[1:04:08] saying he was a boy little curls
[1:04:11] in his law hinders hair and you know
[1:04:13] maybe had a smooth face Amen and sheep
[1:04:17] sheep you know the shepherd was the
[1:04:19] lowest of all things and him back there
[1:04:21] herding sheep but that's what God God
[1:04:27] comes among the sheep it is there God
[1:04:32] comes and fellowship with sheep and as
[1:04:36] long as you keep the Sheep nature the
[1:04:40] Shepherd with fellowship with you is
[1:04:42] that right but when you get to the place
[1:04:45] of all but but but but I know the Word
[1:04:48] of God says this but but hallelujah when
[1:04:52] that doctor told me I had prostrate
[1:04:54] cancer and everything else at first I
[1:04:57] did I did cry you know but sometimes you
[1:04:59] have to regroup
[1:05:02] you gotta regroup some time you shock
[1:05:05] you what am i crying for one thing I'm
[1:05:11] not afraid of death no when God saved me
[1:05:14] he took the fear of death from me hmm
[1:05:19] I was just on the plane not long ago I
[1:05:21] better take the airlines but I was on
[1:05:23] the plane not long ago right and they
[1:05:26] were having trouble with the plane
[1:05:27] before we got off the panel and then we
[1:05:30] they we stayed there two and a half
[1:05:32] hours didn't we come again and got back
[1:05:35] on board and going up the runway and it
[1:05:38] shut down again then the pilot come back
[1:05:40] that stick his head but I something I
[1:05:42] can fix it I can figure that's all
[1:05:44] Oh Lord I said yeah I said Oh Lord he
[1:05:48] gonna get up there and then something
[1:05:50] else gonna happen
[1:05:51] justice I thought it I didn't say it I
[1:05:54] just thought it just as soon as we got
[1:05:56] in with snow and brother and all I could
[1:05:58] see was snow and somehow the the the
[1:06:05] flight attendant she came before this
[1:06:07] happened now she comes to me and she
[1:06:09] says what is that she saw a light now I
[1:06:12] don't know she said there's a like she's
[1:06:15] gonna say light I said and did she went
[1:06:18] and talked to somebody else and she came
[1:06:20] back over to me and said she saw a light
[1:06:23] now I was worshiping the Lord the whole
[1:06:25] time so she probably did you know the
[1:06:28] thing I'm saying is this when she came
[1:06:31] back again I said this my sister says
[1:06:33] Lord you didn't tell me I was gonna die
[1:06:35] today
[1:06:36] I wasn't afraid I just didn't know I was
[1:06:40] gonna die that day cuz I knew I was
[1:06:46] gonna hit that ground it won't be no
[1:06:47] living and then just as soon as I said
[1:06:57] that the Holy Spirit something she went
[1:07:00] through my heart is His perfect love
[1:07:02] cast out fear cuz there was a moment
[1:07:06] there was a moment you know and it's a
[1:07:09] perfect love casts out fear and then
[1:07:11] when and then I said to that sister that
[1:07:13] later I said no it's gonna be alright
[1:07:15] she said I show thank you I really
[1:07:16] appreciate that I really appreciate that
[1:07:18] and I'm gonna tell you how they had us
[1:07:20] on the news they had the fire department
[1:07:22] waiting on us and everything else they
[1:07:24] didn't know where to go to Chicago or to
[1:07:26] turn back but they eventually turn back
[1:07:27] hallelujah but then after us I saw her
[1:07:31] right there in the terminal trying to
[1:07:33] talk to about the Lord and she didn't
[1:07:34] want to hear she was good I prayed
[1:07:38] though y'all understand me what I'm
[1:07:40] saying is this when God when God you
[1:07:43] under circumstances when you
[1:07:45] circumstances come you you you get the
[1:07:48] shock you get the shock but you regroup
[1:07:51] when you regroup and says lord I trust
[1:07:54] you
[1:07:55] that's when God comes on the scene huh
[1:07:58] that's when it comes on the scene he's
[1:08:00] loading us and making us because I
[1:08:03] really mean you might think I'm crazy
[1:08:05] but I really believe if it had going
[1:08:07] down and it was the will of God for me
[1:08:10] to live I would have lived and I'm
[1:08:15] saying like these people of God we are
[1:08:18] the bride of Jesus Christ we can't wait
[1:08:21] well when the squeeze come now it's only
[1:08:24] now it's all me now things are rough
[1:08:29] things are hard things are tough
[1:08:31] hallelujah but the joy of the Lord is my
[1:08:34] strength because I realize I have to be
[1:08:40] changed completely being a Christian is
[1:08:45] not just saying I'm a Christian hello
[1:08:49] how many y'all like Oreos I used to eat
[1:08:54] them things like anyway but Oh chocolate
[1:08:58] cookies with vanilla in the middle or
[1:09:00] not all Orioles we want to be we want to
[1:09:15] be the real thing when we look and said
[1:09:24] listen I'm not striving to be like
[1:09:26] somebody else because I'm unique and
[1:09:29] every one of us are unique hallelujah I
[1:09:33] can't do something that you can do and
[1:09:35] you can't do with something I can do and
[1:09:37] that's beautiful I like it when God put
[1:09:39] it all together you know I'm saying I
[1:09:41] love that amen and you and I must
[1:09:43] understand it's not good to try to
[1:09:46] compare ourselves with somebody else be
[1:09:49] what you are
[1:09:53] hallelujah amen it's the truth it's the
[1:09:58] truth and I don't know I better hit that
[1:10:00] then cause he said you know I find out
[1:10:02] that you you find the musicians they
[1:10:04] have a hard time cuz everybody want to
[1:10:07] sing and everybody want to play you
[1:10:09] can't do all that at one time God has
[1:10:16] selections and you want to be one
[1:10:18] selected for that day is that the truth
[1:10:23] you want to be selected for that day
[1:10:26] maybe the next day you won't be selected
[1:10:28] but if you selected for that day the
[1:10:31] anointing will come down and consume the
[1:10:33] sacrifice but if anything in such a
[1:10:37] small matter is that God will not come
[1:10:40] down like he would have with matured
[1:10:47] Christians hallelujah and you and I must
[1:10:51] understand we must behave ourselves in
[1:10:53] mature ways and I don't know I'm talking
[1:10:57] to somebody now but when when it talked
[1:11:00] when we talk about making heaven I know
[1:11:03] that God is working in me and he's not
[1:11:07] through with me yet the thing that I
[1:11:11] want more than anything when I get to
[1:11:14] heaven some might say well if I get
[1:11:15] there and I'm gonna do it man you know
[1:11:20] what the dome that is no matter what's
[1:11:26] on the bottom of your shoe you wipe that
[1:11:29] on the doormat and so most of us can't
[1:11:31] even be there cuz somebody say one
[1:11:33] little thing against you you are man see
[1:11:39] so you don't want no you can't be a
[1:11:41] doormat because that's not what you were
[1:11:43] made to be I want to hear God say well
[1:11:46] done
[1:11:49] well done ah oh if I could just only get
[1:11:53] in there only getting in there when that
[1:11:57] first resurrection took place they were
[1:11:59] just and rather weak and ready to do it
[1:12:15] again y'all hear me we're getting ready
[1:12:20] to do it again and all the little
[1:12:24] God y'all see I used to be in the band
[1:12:26] so I don't know how they they do things
[1:12:28] you know they all back there practicing
[1:12:32] and doing everything else before the
[1:12:33] parade you want to make sure they all
[1:12:34] tuned up that's all they're doing up
[1:12:36] there
[1:12:37] they're just tuning it up because you
[1:12:40] got to understand they cannot be
[1:12:42] complete without us Holy Ghost to bring
[1:12:49] us into perfect now I'm gonna tell you
[1:12:53] how you know you gonna get it how you
[1:12:55] know you're gonna be tested right Jesus
[1:13:00] had done shown throughout his cavalry
[1:13:02] marching the cavalry showed those
[1:13:04] virtues and then he came all the way up
[1:13:07] to brotherly kindness amen when he spoke
[1:13:10] with that thief and told that thief you
[1:13:12] know but that wasn't a capping of it you
[1:13:16] said I'm saying now he's in pain see and
[1:13:19] a lot of times we say Oh she'll get over
[1:13:21] here get over it no that's wrong and
[1:13:25] most of us we don't know how to forgive
[1:13:27] while we're in pain and Jesus said
[1:13:32] Father forgive them while he was in pain
[1:13:35] for they know not what they do
[1:13:38] what'd you say that's Jesus well what
[1:13:39] about Steven when they were stoning him
[1:13:42] he said Lord hold not these things to
[1:13:45] their job hostile against flesh and
[1:13:49] blood this batter we God is not against
[1:13:52] our
[1:13:53] it's against the devil's that inspires
[1:13:55] our brothers hallelujah and you and I
[1:13:58] must recognize that you got you we can't
[1:14:01] just sit here
[1:14:02] Amen and have these meant mind like men
[1:14:04] the Bible said quit thinking like men
[1:14:07] you're supposed to think like a god
[1:14:11] [Music]
[1:14:13] hallelujah
[1:14:15] you become invincible when crisis in you
[1:14:18] that means you can't win you can't lose
[1:14:21] a battle
[1:14:25] y'all y'all start y'all you pausing on
[1:14:27] God but when the Holy Ghost is in there
[1:14:31] and the world is being preached the Holy
[1:14:33] Ghost would say Amen
[1:14:35] even if it's painful he'll still say
[1:14:38] Amen because that's his word hallelujah
[1:14:48] and when you talk about to my love
[1:14:50] that's where we got to be hmm oh yeah
[1:14:55] Joseph was a perfection right Joseph
[1:14:57] perfection but Joseph had to do one
[1:14:59] thing
[1:15:00] he not only had to go and show brotherly
[1:15:02] kindness now he don't went through all
[1:15:04] the other little virtues that he had to
[1:15:05] come through but he had the so brotherly
[1:15:07] kindness he saw his brothers and you
[1:15:11] don't think he got an attitude he did
[1:15:13] any human being would have the devil
[1:15:17] take you down memory lane yeah they sold
[1:15:20] me and they did this to me and I can
[1:15:21] remember this and you remember that and
[1:15:23] how they threw you in the ditching oh
[1:15:26] yeah and David was I mean Joseph was
[1:15:29] playing a little games with him at first
[1:15:31] you know God had to step in God had to
[1:15:39] step in and no doubt God at some point
[1:15:45] time you got to read between the lines
[1:15:46] God would no doubt says remember that
[1:15:49] vision remember that dream this is what
[1:15:54] it was all about see the purpose of God
[1:15:58] could not be stopped
[1:16:00] hallelujah no matter what the missing
[1:16:03] God shook nature God turn the hands of
[1:16:09] nature against is Israel to bring them
[1:16:14] to Egypt could they would not have ever
[1:16:16] come but God vision had a dream had to
[1:16:20] be be fulfilled that Joseph's brothers
[1:16:24] and his daddy had to bow they plan that
[1:16:34] part
[1:16:35] they can't go beyond their boundaries
[1:16:42] they shall be mine Oh somebody help me
[1:16:49] they shall be mine we'll be in the city
[1:16:55] and they'll be bringing it in
[1:16:58] just like Joseph's brothers come on
[1:17:08] somebody has a part and Joseph had to
[1:17:16] see his brothers and no doubt the devil
[1:17:20] is flipping well you know you barely
[1:17:23] escaped Potiphar's wife you know how
[1:17:25] that man forgot you know he left you and
[1:17:29] Jenny from you know all the bad stuff
[1:17:30] all the bad stuff Joseph had to forgive
[1:17:35] them and what happened not only did he
[1:17:39] forgive them he gave them great kisses
[1:17:42] get great treasures gave them land gave
[1:17:46] them food gave them that which was once
[1:17:50] this enemy because I'm gonna tell you
[1:17:52] something a brother is a brother
[1:17:55] somebody help me you can't change that
[1:17:58] relationship you understanding it is
[1:18:02] what it is you can't change it so
[1:18:05] you might as well love it somebody help
[1:18:09] me God listen people you think you can't
[1:18:12] get to heaven without loving your
[1:18:14] enemies
[1:18:14] you ain't got no enemies God don't give
[1:18:17] you some cuz you got to learn how to
[1:18:21] love your enemy
[1:18:27] help us Lord and we got plenty of right
[1:18:32] I'm my greatest enemy though I'm almost
[1:18:37] done but let me say it like this if
[1:18:41] we're gonna get to heaven we meet we
[1:18:44] must be led by God huh
[1:18:48] whichever way all we say that though I
[1:18:50] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[1:18:52] death and you know what Lord don't take
[1:18:55] me there no but you gotta go there
[1:18:59] David was a man after God's own heart
[1:19:01] and God loved David so much his very
[1:19:05] songs became the word and you and I must
[1:19:12] understand that these things these
[1:19:13] expression did David make mistakes of
[1:19:15] course he did but God still loved him
[1:19:20] unconditionally y'all understand me you
[1:19:25] must all I'm trying to say something
[1:19:26] here because God is teaching me I've had
[1:19:29] people to lie on me I've had them I
[1:19:32] don't know where they get up.get their
[1:19:33] imaginations from I do know but pointing
[1:19:39] but why they talk with me I don't know
[1:19:43] but it comes back to being jealous
[1:19:45] that's the key word jealous because King
[1:19:49] was jealous of Abel it comes right back
[1:19:52] to jealousy right Lucifer Lucifer was
[1:19:55] jealous and Micah so when it all boils
[1:19:59] down hallelujah you and I must
[1:20:02] understand amen we are on a mission
[1:20:07] and though we do not understand the
[1:20:11] trials Lord I just come out of the ditch
[1:20:14] now I'm in Potiphar's house and Here
[1:20:17] Come his wife it ain't going to stop
[1:20:19] until God protects you do you want it to
[1:20:27] stop
[1:20:28] see y'all scared you're scared you know
[1:20:31] I'm trying to tell you why why the
[1:20:34] battles are on yes your flesh has
[1:20:37] stopped but your soul says hey your soul
[1:20:45] got a crowd amen
[1:20:46] cuz your soul knows what's best for you
[1:20:52] you love the Lord prepare
[1:20:57] [Music]
[1:21:01] you
[1:21:06] in Psalms 87 and 6 it says the Lord
[1:21:10] shall count when he righted up the
[1:21:13] people that this man was born there
[1:21:16] didn't say men says man this man counted
[1:21:22] up the people that this man one man was
[1:21:26] born there
[1:21:30] you understand me so every true seed of
[1:21:33] God has been counted up and the body of
[1:21:38] Christ cannot be completed if one is
[1:21:41] missing because all make one man and you
[1:21:50] and I must understand by God's go I'm so
[1:21:52] happy you know to know that God has
[1:21:55] included me in this thing and he won't
[1:22:00] even let me get out of it he won't even
[1:22:05] let me get out of it you never know how
[1:22:07] many time I said look
[1:22:08] oh I said Lord you know what I just wish
[1:22:11] I had just been a singer I've been so
[1:22:13] happy god is great
[1:22:21] anyway let me say like this you want to
[1:22:24] be your real self you never know who you
[1:22:28] really are until you really born again
[1:22:30] and that's why the devil is trying to
[1:22:34] keep you from obtaining your precious
[1:22:40] promises whatever he can do he can't
[1:22:44] stop you he can't delay you but he
[1:22:47] cannot stop you and I don't know about
[1:22:50] you but I'm like if I could hurry this I
[1:22:52] want to hurry it and I say why because
[1:22:57] our world is getting ready to lose it
[1:22:59] you know and I know that they are so GAD
[1:23:03] they are so confused if you don't know
[1:23:06] you living in the daylight like no one
[1:23:09] in Sodom I mean you just don't know but
[1:23:13] we're here and you ask me we're beyond
[1:23:15] that and my point is this if that be the
[1:23:18] case where is the seed of God what are
[1:23:22] you doing because you got to understand
[1:23:24] it's just you see how the stars are
[1:23:26] outside do you recognize the stars you
[1:23:28] bet you see all this blackness out there
[1:23:31] hallelujah and then you got a little
[1:23:33] star here a little star there a little
[1:23:34] stuff that's how the seeds of God are
[1:23:36] here we are covered with darkness
[1:23:40] and God is depending on you to be
[1:23:43] let your light is that right that's the
[1:23:46] way the Bible said don't put your light
[1:23:49] on the bush all put in somewhere where
[1:23:52] it can be seen don't be ashamed I want
[1:23:56] you believe I saw just the other day
[1:23:58] Amen they sent me this thing on YouTube
[1:24:00] and this looked like a Spanish lady on
[1:24:02] the airplane I said that's the way it
[1:24:06] used to be we didn't care where we were
[1:24:10] when the Holy Ghost hit you you moved
[1:24:12] oh come on somehow oh yeah some of y'all
[1:24:16] don't remember that but that's the way
[1:24:17] it used to be you think I was in college
[1:24:20] Universal South Carolina and I couldn't
[1:24:23] I'd brain freeze and I so God just give
[1:24:26] me give me give me give me please I then
[1:24:29] he gave it to me and I started jumping
[1:24:30] and speaking in tongues I didn't care I
[1:24:36] was coming home from school I can't
[1:24:38] remember what I was thinking about and
[1:24:39] my porch was like this high I had to
[1:24:43] step up to get it and before I could
[1:24:45] step up the Holy Ghost hit me and I went
[1:24:48] to I didn't know nobody was looking no
[1:25:00] you're different if they don't see the
[1:25:02] difference
[1:25:05] it must be a manifestation and if you
[1:25:08] all I can't hardly stand it you go to
[1:25:11] these marketplaces and you see people
[1:25:13] with long dresses on and long hair and
[1:25:16] everything else and it looks so
[1:25:17] sanctified and look like it look like
[1:25:19] that the whole world yeah you'd be
[1:25:24] afraid to talk to him gun it look so sad
[1:25:28] look like they haven't smiled in a long
[1:25:30] time and I said to myself you think I
[1:25:34] won't that whatever that is I don't own
[1:25:36] it it's the truth it's the truth
[1:25:42] you know we saints of God let me tell
[1:25:44] you something one thing about a preacher
[1:25:46] even if a preacher ain't feeling good
[1:25:48] he's got to act like he is
[1:25:50] [Music]
[1:25:52] and you ought to be the same way I can't
[1:25:55] oh I tell you what when I used to have a
[1:25:57] job and people of you say well you you
[1:26:00] look like you ain't feeling well that
[1:26:01] would be such a slap in my face I feel I
[1:26:05] feel so bad I say Lord I wasn't showing
[1:26:09] you they saw me I don't want them to see
[1:26:11] me like this
[1:26:11] you know what I'm saying I want the
[1:26:14] world to see me in such a joyous way
[1:26:16] that every every time I see you you
[1:26:18] smiling but that's how it is now that's
[1:26:21] because every time I see you brothers
[1:26:22] you smiling that's what I want you to
[1:26:24] see I want you to see what's going on on
[1:26:29] the inside of me not the outside the
[1:26:32] inside of me that's where we are
[1:26:39] hallelujah and you said what do you mean
[1:26:41] brother books I'm trying to say I'm I
[1:26:43] didn't when I think about it Amen that
[1:26:45] this whole book one day I was in my
[1:26:47] kitchen and the Holy Spirit sent this
[1:26:50] Bible is you that's deep
[1:26:55] I said how he said because I told you to
[1:26:59] eat the book and understand when you eat
[1:27:03] the book that's what you are you said
[1:27:05] what what do you mean I say see what
[1:27:07] people don't understand I don't I can't
[1:27:09] remember all it is but if I'm sealed
[1:27:12] with the Holy Spirit I got all of this
[1:27:16] see what I'm saying
[1:27:17] I got all this oh this isn't me I had
[1:27:24] the potential of using every bit of it
[1:27:27] come on somebody
[1:27:29] let me like it like this some sisters
[1:27:31] this is just like a cookbook hallelujah
[1:27:35] when you want to cook up something or
[1:27:36] you gotta use turn to certain pages set
[1:27:40] some fire needs
[1:27:42] Oh oh yeah when I had that stroke and it
[1:27:53] had me limping in my face drooping down
[1:27:55] here a little bit
[1:27:56] amen I didn't even say the doctor you
[1:27:58] know they won't they won't ask you how
[1:27:59] much did sin how much did you kill this
[1:28:02] I tell him nothing
[1:28:03] I couldn't even I couldn't even hardly
[1:28:07] swallow you know what because I knew
[1:28:10] they were gonna give me more medication
[1:28:13] I said Lord you don't want me like this
[1:28:16] do you I said I can't even saying for
[1:28:18] you're not preached for you like this
[1:28:20] hallelujah and I'm a run ahead and ran
[1:28:22] in a long time you could probably tell
[1:28:23] that now but anyway running down with
[1:28:31] the stripes I'm healed with the stripes
[1:28:33] I'm healed with the stripes I'm here and
[1:28:35] guess what my body had to obey with the
[1:28:38] stripes I'm healed with the stripes I'm
[1:28:41] healed yummy
[1:28:43] [Applause]
[1:28:45] you don't take what the devil tell you
[1:28:49] hallelujah
[1:28:50] just like their loves maybe a year ago I
[1:28:53] think was my mother law a friend or
[1:28:55] whatever it was
[1:28:56] amen the doctor say you know you die and
[1:28:58] she said did Jesus tell you that if
[1:29:02] Jesus didn't tell you where do you get
[1:29:04] your information from you don't receive
[1:29:13] those bad reports like that y'all know
[1:29:17] it you know because when the doctors
[1:29:20] bring out stuff you know they give it
[1:29:21] the worst report and they want to see
[1:29:24] you cry and if you don't cry they gonna
[1:29:26] look at you until they keep working it
[1:29:30] they get pleasure especially seeing
[1:29:32] Christians cry or you say I'm a
[1:29:34] Christian or they wanted a dick coming

[1:30:11] y'all say they don't guess they do
[1:30:13] I remember my last baby my yeah my next
[1:30:18] to the last baby my wife was having a
[1:30:20] hard time I mean they treated her really
[1:30:23] bad at that hospital and wouldn't they

[1:30:45] my wife just went out was afraid
[1:30:49] and she she was so happy and that
[1:30:56] doctors always said gee thank you Jesus

[1:31:28] you're the Bible said make your calling
[1:31:33] and election sure that's all I'm saying
[1:31:38] and all that we're doing we don't want
[1:31:40] to come up short and y'all gotta
[1:31:43] understand how the world got this thing
[1:31:45] like all these planes gonna be crashing
[1:31:47] and all of that stuff ain't no
[1:31:50] Christians Holly on those planes you
[1:31:58] know the two right if you know the
[1:32:03] reason why I stay afloat sometime
[1:32:05] because you own there but ain't nothing
[1:32:09] Christian about planes planes and buses
[1:32:13] you have a bill on the bus with a bus
[1:32:15] driver having y'all seen them real
[1:32:18] Christians on y'all know what I'm saying
[1:32:20] they're few shoe and the world got
[1:32:24] everything is in chaos because the
[1:32:26] rapture is taking place it will not be
[1:32:29] that way hallelujah and the only people
[1:32:34] that will know that the bride is gone
[1:32:36] will be the foolish virgins that's it
[1:32:40] like no new Enoch was gone that's it and
[1:32:45] you and I I look at this thing says
[1:32:47] listen I think that this one leave and
[1:32:50] that one leaving this backslide and that
[1:32:52] one backslide you know it's like running
[1:32:54] a race when I should run cross country
[1:32:58] when people I was not know
[1:33:01] I didn't wanna win those big trophies
[1:33:03] but I'm George running y'all understand
[1:33:06] but you know because somebody you know
[1:33:08] running you know that's why I hate to
[1:33:12] get people in front of me cuz they quit
[1:33:14] and when they quit you have something
[1:33:16] happening you like you know you can quit
[1:33:18] too
[1:33:18] you have to push harder when somebody in
[1:33:21] front of you stop running
[1:33:24] hallelujah so I'd like to stay in the
[1:33:26] front
[1:33:27] y'all know them saying I'd like to stay
[1:33:30] in the front so I can't see who's
[1:33:31] falling behind me I'm running cuz I
[1:33:34] gotta I gotta go to make I got a line to
[1:33:37] cross over
[1:33:38] y'all you me and understand by God's
[1:33:42] grace and I know y'all do I keep saying
[1:33:44] that but I'm trying to emphasize you
[1:33:46] without the Holy Ghost
[1:33:48] you have no resurrection no resurrection
[1:33:53] all your living will be in vain it's a
[1:33:58] must it's a requirement hallelujah only
[1:34:03] Jesus Christ will be in the city you
[1:34:09] understand me
[1:34:09] you called him his bride whatever you
[1:34:11] called just like I tell people I said
[1:34:13] i'ma tell you how it was if God had go
[1:34:17] into that craving says without saying
[1:34:20] calling Lazarus by his name everybody
[1:34:22] didn't agree what he got up she the name
[1:34:26] is important that's why we baptized in
[1:34:29] his name that's why when we pray we pray
[1:34:31] in his name whatever you do in word or
[1:34:34] deed do it all in his name right because
[1:34:38] when Jesus come to make a rapture he
[1:34:41] ain't gonna call Suzie Tom James Jim bah
[1:34:44] bah bah bah bah bah bah he's calling one
[1:34:46] body and that one body has one name
[1:34:51] hallelujah come on and that name is his
[1:34:55] character
[1:35:00] mmm you gotta have it take your licks
[1:35:04] take whatever you gotta go through and
[1:35:05] say thank you Jesus Lord you love me you
[1:35:10] love me and I appreciate everything that
[1:35:12] you're doing for me I do I do I got to
[1:35:16] go through it you got to go through it
[1:35:17] the folks it ain't gonna get no easier
[1:35:24] you love the Lord I feel I feel the
[1:35:27] motions to stop right now I don't know
[1:35:32] if there be anybody who desire prayer
[1:35:35] you don't necessarily need to come up
[1:35:37] but if we could just stand and have a
[1:35:40] word of Prayer you know Ephesians talks
[1:35:48] about growing up in unto Him in love it
[1:35:50] says but speak the truth in love may
[1:35:53] grow up into him in all things which is
[1:35:56] the head even Christ so the things that
[1:35:59] we're going to ask this is what I was
[1:36:01] trying to tell my church I said we've
[1:36:03] heard so many great mysteries I said
[1:36:06] we've heard enough mysteries to take us
[1:36:08] through I said but what about the life
[1:36:11] where is the character of Christ in the
[1:36:14] people this is what we need to see and
[1:36:16] this is what the people need to hear
[1:36:19] when listen if you packing demons ain't
[1:36:24] no demons going to heaven ain't no
[1:36:27] demons going in that city right and
[1:36:32] that's what the Bible says to who you
[1:36:34] you your members to obey that's whose
[1:36:35] servant you are I know that stuff people
[1:36:38] but is real Jesus said told is that
[1:36:41] there is no darkness in me so you can't
[1:36:45] be in Christ and have darkness in you
[1:36:49] right
[1:36:50] oh we said oh I got the Holy Ghost but
[1:36:52] the real way to say it is the Holy Ghost
[1:36:54] got me see and you and I must don't
[1:36:59] understand by God's grace that God has
[1:37:02] us all right that's what I want I don't
[1:37:07] care what is it listen what are you what
[1:37:09] is your identity
[1:37:11] don't you know if the law tarry every
[1:37:13] one of us gonna die and all you want to
[1:37:16] have above you is a tombstone my what is
[1:37:19] that even the people who got their names
[1:37:22] and lights here in in this world and
[1:37:25] they're dead what good is it all their
[1:37:29] achievements have gone down but like
[1:37:32] they did and understand just like Peter
[1:37:35] well I don't know whether yeah there is
[1:37:37] a hell there's another dimension and and
[1:37:40] if you don't go up you go down right
[1:37:43] right so you and I must understand we're
[1:37:46] we're preparing to go up right and you
[1:37:50] must be qualified it can't be well you
[1:37:54] know what qualified David be outside of
[1:37:57] his brothers was the anointing was the
[1:38:00] election of God and God's anointing it's
[1:38:05] the truth mister truth and that's that's
[1:38:09] what makes the difference between us the
[1:38:12] election with the anointing the election
[1:38:17] with the anointing an anointing don't
[1:38:21] mean that you got to be out of your mind
[1:38:22] you know per se what I'm saying is an or
[1:38:26] tickets when you have things under
[1:38:27] control
[1:38:29] spiritually right you know Jesus
[1:38:32] wouldn't win there when the waves were
[1:38:34] dashing and everything else did y'all
[1:38:36] know that's when God really blesses when
[1:38:39] troubles in your life that's when God
[1:38:41] really really blesses is that the truth
[1:38:44] yeah he Peter didn't walk on clean water
[1:38:48] he walked on the water when everything
[1:38:49] was Jesus empty speech steel so you got
[1:38:53] to understand all these things that we
[1:38:55] go through it's necessary it's a good
[1:39:00] thing dear Jesus we thank you for your
[1:39:04] grace in your mercy we thank you for
