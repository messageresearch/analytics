[0:00] I felt like the spirit of the Lord began
[0:02] to minister to me that he is about to
[0:05] send a search light. I I appreciate that
[0:09] because the search light of his love,
[0:11] the spirit's light, the light of the
[0:13] Holy Ghost, he's about, I feel like, to
[0:16] send that again, another wave of that in
[0:19] our lives as individuals to to search
[0:22] out the things. If we're carrying scars
[0:26] or wounds or offense that we have not
[0:29] yet submitted to the blood of Jesus
[0:32] Christ, I believe God's not quite
[0:34] through digging. and he began to talk to
[0:37] my heart. Uh I'm going to I'm going to
[0:39] show uh even the deep things that that
[0:42] people are yet carrying. And I'm doing
[0:45] it for my glory, not not to embarrass
[0:47] anybody or or to or to condemn. May I
[0:51] just say this to you that God's ultimate
[0:53] purpose in putting his finger on your
[0:56] life is always redemption. It's never
[1:00] condemnation. It's never to judge,
[1:03] condemn, or cause you to feel guilty.
[1:06] It's to cause you to feel convicted. And
[1:08] when you feel convicted, guess what you
[1:10] do? You cry out to him, and he gets to
[1:13] step in and rescue you and be a redeemer
[1:16] of that situation. I want you to
[1:19] remember that God knows what darkness
[1:21] tries to hide. There's it's the very
[1:23] nature of darkness to try to conceal
[1:26] something. But God's got an answer for
[1:28] it because he revealth the deep and
[1:30] secret things. No plot is too hidden
[1:33] from him. No heart is too shadowed. No
[1:37] motive is too deeply buried. God is not
[1:41] intimidated by secrecy. It is his nature
[1:44] to be the revealer of secret things,
[1:47] good and bad and ugly. It's not just
[1:51] stopping the behavior. It's dealing with
[1:54] the issue. Why is that there? And what
[1:58] can I do about it? Aren't you glad all
[2:00] it takes is for God to turn the light of
[2:03] his church love on us?
[2:06] And then he gives grace
[2:08] to do something about it. It's time to
[2:11] to to be honest with
[2:13] yourself and honest before the Lord and
[2:17] tell him, "I'm just not what I have
[2:20] thought I am, but I am depending on you
[2:24] and you called me." See, you better know
[2:26] he called you. You better understand
[2:29] that he saw you and he called you. He
[2:32] saw you and he chose you. And he didn't
[2:35] choose you because he intended to lose
[2:37] you. He chose you because he intends to
[2:39] finish you.
[2:42] Because he is not just the author of our
[2:45] faith, but he is also the
[2:49] Is there anybody in this house that
[2:50] believes that God is a big enough God to
[2:52] finish what he started?
[2:56] Please don't live like you think he
[2:58] forgot you. What's to hold up you? We've
[3:01] got to deal with the issues of the
[3:02] heart. The issues of the heart or the
[3:05] battles of the mind. Same thing I said
[3:08] the issues of the heart are the battles
[3:09] of the mind. And this is what we have to
[3:12] deal with. If you're still nurturing and
[3:15] nursing an offense that someone gave you
[3:18] yesterday, you're running late.
[3:22] You're already defeating your own self.
[3:25] You are sabotaging your own victory.
[3:31] You You think God cares that you're
[3:33] hurt? He most certainly does.
[3:39] He may look at us sometime like we
[3:41] certainly ought to be a little tougher
[3:42] than that by now, but he cares about our
[3:44] hurts and he cares about our wounds. And
[3:48] that's why he tells us again today,
[3:50] casting, are you with me? Casting all of
[3:54] your cares
[3:55] on me, he said.
[3:58] Why? Because I want to be in your
[4:00] business. Yes. That's exactly what he's
[4:04] saying. I want to be in your business. I
[4:08] want to know what you're suffering with.
[4:10] I want to understand how you feel. You
[4:13] see, we do not Hebrews said we do not
[4:15] have a high priest that cannot be
[4:18] touched with the feeling of our
[4:20] infirmities. And he cares that you've
[4:23] been wounded. And he cares that you've
[4:25] shed a tear. And he cares that you feel
[4:27] like you've lost a little blood. But he
[4:29] tells you what to do. And it's up to you
[4:31] to do it.
[4:33] Casting all your cares. I'm preaching
[4:35] this morning. Casting all your cares on
[4:38] me, for I care for you. Get rid of it.
[4:44] Get it over on me.
[4:47] It's overwhelming to you. It overpowers
[4:49] you. It seems at times to overcome you.
[4:52] I guarantee you it won't overpower him.
[4:55] I guarantee you it won't overwhelm him.
[4:58] I guarantee you he can handle it.
[5:02] But he wants you to get it off of you as
[5:04] fast as you possibly can. Today's
[5:07] another day.
