heavenly father and you're mindful of her you know that she's there and she's asking for believers her family's asking for believers if they just hold her up before God that there would be a restoration for brother Mike because brother Wes has mentioned brother Mike sievert this morning we hold him up before you Lord asking you to move in a supernatural way knowing that it's already done by the shed blood and by the stripes you more we put our name in that scripture I write my name there you were wounded for Daniel Miller's transgressions you were bruised Daniel Miller oh God and how

say it again and the Maze are not here today well we're going to have to go looking for them because we've gotten very used to having them and I'm so thankful for it I just got some very sad news personally and that is that a a friend of ours who used to play the violin in conferences where I was a speaker his name was Jason uh heistad I believe is the way that you pronounced it um some of you met him because he was in the uh uh Daphne meetings when brother green came and spoke he was a larger fella with the red kind of reddish beard and my goodness could he play and his wife beautiful Jackie passed away this morning young and they've got a young son I say young he's probably maybe close to being a teenager he is 16 now and she fought a real fight and I'm very sorry for that family my my mind is going to him today because we had a wonderful conversation one time about the ministry of brother Branham and he showed so much respect these are just Pentecostal or charismatic type people but he showed so much respect and he complimented our life and and my wife's testimony among those people would you pray that the Lord would comfort his heart he is a real talented musician and very very anointed um if I showed you a picture some of you would remember him from the from the Daphne meeting my wife has some stickers this morning she said for the Sisters but you mean to give to the children or what do you mean did you see all the flowery ties the men had on this morning only women can like flowers did you know the greatest Gardeners of this nation were always men did you know Benjamin Franklin and our founding fathers were all gardeners back off I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding I like flowers I like the garden anyway don't do much with it anymore but I have fond memories of when I used to um brother Bobby Wertz has these stickers printed what do they say have faith and some little flowers on them with a mustard seed that's right okay with the bloom of the mustard and he gives those out everywhere he goes and embarrasses us all sometime because he will chase somebody down through the parking lot to give him a sticker you want a sticker and people go you know they don't know what to do with it but you'd be surprised how many times those stickers have have really touched people's lives and it's a reminder to have faith so my girls carry them in their phone cases or on their phone case and you can have some that you can give some to the children or whatever you want to do and if there's a brother who wants to have faith I don't know why only sisters are supposed to have faith but if I'm in that kind of a mood you'll just have to pray for me I've I've been off this week a little bit so I'm kind of you know uh feeling a little ornery I don't want to pay too much later so I'll love my wife happy wife you got it wanted to get that out of the way I wanted to uh mention that tomorrow is brother coya's birthday all the way in Japan so we send our love and our greetings to brother Koya and pray that God will make a way for them to be back here and see us some of the some of these days we're thankful for their family we're thankful for sister fousey and her mother's sister and Miko and dabuki it's just a wonderful thing how God connected us they flew all the way from Japan to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what a real testimony tomorrow is also Michael and crystalline's wedding anniversary is that right Michael all right we say happy anniversary to them [Applause] Tuesday is Ian's birthday he's not here but you be sure to tell him uh happy birthday when you see him again and also that is brother Eddie Miller's birthday on Tuesday so we send our happy birthday greetings and lots of love to both brother Eddie and Sister Janet Miller and she is having surgery this week a serious surgery and so we want to go to the Lord in prayer for her on on Friday there is a tumor in her spine that has been there for some time we thank God that it's not cancerous it's not malignant but it has wrapped itself around the nerves and it's going to be a little bit of a process I would think of of untangling that thing and getting it out but she needs the mobility and she needs to be pain-free she has a great responsibility on her shoulders that's brother Daniel's mother and Dad we're talking about and they are beginning to liquidate and their their desire and plans are to to come and live among us and we're looking forward to that and she needed to get this taken care of because of the hard days ahead of moving and all that she's going through so we want to say happy birthday to our brother and to remind Sister Janet that we are praying and we're believing God for not only guiding the surgeon's hands but miraculous Supernatural recovery that baffles the doctors Wednesday is that sister Louise's birthday is her birthday in July remember we have this thing every year and uh she's got two or three profiles on Facebook and each of them have a different birthday or something and we get confused every year I always want to wish her a happy but so sister Louisa happy Wednesday to you this coming Wednesday and if it happens to be your birthday then happy birthday to you I think maybe it is we sure love the Weirs Thursday is sister nakisha's birthday did you know it and we are so happy

worship cameraman the computer people the the streaming folks there's a lot that goes in to making this possible Ephesians chapter 3 beginning in verse 14 we greet you saints that are streaming the service uh some even from Columbus Georgia Arkansas and I'm not sure where you're from Brother Samuel I can't make out that flag but God bless you all wherever you're from and that's on Facebook and then on on YouTube God bless the Saints in Indiana in Indiana uh Jennifer Stark streaming on her phone on the way home back to Indiana Norway Quebec Canada God bless you all there and uh India we send our love Cape Town greetings God bless you all and and just so many others that if you don't tell us where you're from we don't even know you're there and and we heard that while they were at Youth Camp some of them were talking and they recognize brother Greely not from knowing brother Greeley but from the Stream and it happened to be someone who who just really surprised just surprised that they were even streaming that they caught the service but we never know do we or sometimes we do because sometimes the Holy Spirit just opens it up but most of the time if he doesn't show us we don't know unless you put your flag in or tell us where you're from but God he has a way of joining us together the bride is hungry you're going to help me Preach Today Ephesians chapter 3 beginning in verse 14 for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that's powerful that helps me to understand that baptism is not to be in any other way but in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we say because we know that his name in Hebrew was not Jesus his mother never would have used the name Jesus because it wasn't a name that was being used at that time so we also like to say Yeshua I like saying that sometime I'm not a fanatic I'm not a dogmatic I I I I'm not a sacred name like some of the groups that say that Jesus is adult name dog's name and it's known virtue oh you're too late to tell me it's not it's not pronouncing it just right no no no it's the faith it gets attached to it that moves oh my your way I've seen the dead raised in the name of Jesus so he answers to whatever we call him in faith every time I say that I remember that old song they used to sing uh sister Annie Jones I heard the song years before I knew sister Annie but sister Annie Jones who used to come here from Canada year after year she lived here part-time before she moved to Heaven she would sing that for me sometime and it's the old missionary song and it's a true story of a missionary going into a village where there was no the name of Jesus had never been mentioned and this this missionary testified of the Miracles that were done in this name and the little woman walked miles and miles and miles back through the jungles to get to her Village and as long as she could she kept repeating that name but as she grew weary she stopped saying the name and when she got home she forgot the name and she said oh Lord what will I do what will I do I don't remember the name she walked all the way hours back through the jungle woke the missionary up and said tell me his name again seeing me love sweetest refrain of one who in the whole family in heaven is called by that name and the whole family of God on the earth is called by that name aren't you glad to be one of them identified with his name and then it goes on to say that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the in the Inner Man your strength doesn't come in muscle and Brawn your strength comes from the inner man as you feed on Christ The Living Word your inner man as is strengthened as you spend time in the presence of the Lord as we are doing today your inner man receives the Breath of God and the strength of God do you believe that that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye may be filled with all the fullness of God what happens when you feel somebody with all the fullness of God what do you have you have deity living in a human body that shouldn't stumble anybody what do you think the Holy Ghost is don't answer the third person of the Trinity because I'll tell you there's no Bible for that the very holy ghost in you is the creative Spirit of the father amen and so if deity lives in you all of you may not be deity because you still got a flesh body but this holy ghost that lives inside of you is God that's who it is it's God and this was not some mystery to the early church because here is the messenger clearly telling us to know the love of Christ which passive knowledge that you might be filled with all help me say all with all the fullness of God what a church what a bride what a people come on now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above help me with the word all exceeding abundantly above all that we ask oh you know sometimes you can't pray big enough but you get to imagining big enough we got to learn to turn our imagination into prayer God has spoken to us more than once and said you're not asking big enough you're not believing big enough you're limiting me by your faith how many of you know we don't want to limit god with our faith we want to loose him with our faith amen according let's read this again because somebody keeps interrupting the reading of the scripture now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think so that means here we go again that means you can't even think it big enough because he's a you think as big as you possibly can of what God can do and then he can go right up above that exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think according now listen how he works listen how he grants according to the power that works in him that works in US now we know where the power comes from it comes in us because he lives in US is that right under him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End Amen and the church said you may be seated as God should add his Blessing to the reading of his word I want to preach to you a little while this morning on a subject that's not new to you I've taken the subject a time or two through the years but I want to talk to you about asking abundantly somebody needs to get this somebody needs to know your prayers are stifling the master you're limiting him you're setting restriction on him by your church entity come on you need to know who you are I want to quote this again I heard brother Ronald Dean Spencer quote this at the dedication services for for um Word of Life I think you call it now and I've heard him use this a lot but I want to use it again uh the trainer of Muhammad Ali you know when I when I would listen as a boy to Muhammad Ali talking it it certainly sounded like he didn't need nobody to tell him who he was he needed somebody to remind him of his Humanity you know because he was a big talker talk about smack talk he was probably the doctor of smack talk you know the leader of that and and uh they used to say he floats like a butterfly he'd say it I float like a butterfly and sting like a bee one of the greatest boxers of all time you folks that are looking at me like uh I am worldly your Prophet was a boxer brother Branham was a boxer that doesn't mean I want to be one although I do would like to have a punching bag sometime wouldn't you I believe it would help me more than I can tell but uh he was a boxer quite a boxer his daughter boxes now they tell me and um but anyway uh the trainer said that he realized that his job his responsibility was not to teach Muhammad Ali how to fight because she already knew how to fight he said I'm not here today he's going into a big fight I'm not here today to teach you how to fight I'm here to remind you who you are you are the heavyweight champion of the world I am here to tell you who you are you are the champion and when you get in that boxing ring that's who you are and that's who you better remember you are and that's how you ought to perform as the champion of the world maybe you're not getting that but that is my responsibility again this morning to I can't teach you how to fight the devil the words already told you how to do that but I can remind you who you are I can tell you that he wants to move for you more than you want him to move I can tell you that your highest expectation is not big enough your greatest imagination of what God can do it doesn't begin to even match what he is capable of doing come on and we just have to make sure that we are looking at the right thing see I'm not one of those people who who believe this humanistic idea that you can be anything you want to be I absolutely don't believe that so you can't I can't preach that and I can't give a pep talk using that line because I want you to know you can be everything and anything that God created you to be but but not just what you want to be you may want to be the president you may never be the president you may never be able to be the president you're probably not crooked enough to be the president so you ought to get your sights a little higher than that anyhow so I'm not just telling you to sit there and think of you know what I want to be a millionaire and and so I'm going to start asking God to make me a millionaire there's nothing wrong with being a millionaire by the way I wished about three of you were millionaires four or five of you then we'd never have to receive another offering toward the principle so I'm not against somebody being a a millionaire but I'll tell you what the old preacher used to say God will give you what he can trusts you with and if you've got your eyes on on wisdom and watch it now don't don't misunderstand the scripture somebody said money is the root of all evil that is not what the scripture said you know better than that it said the Love of Money I know some people who have some money and they don't love it in fact at times they wish they didn't have to deal with it because where there's money there's sometime a lot of red tape and complication and heart Aiden problem come on now you got to set your affection on something higher than that but if you make sure that you're looking at the Kingdom I want to just say it I'll just spill my I'll just spill my my punchline right now if you are looking at the kingdom of God ahead of you you will always ask for the kingdom you'll ask for the kingdom you'll ask for what benefits the kingdom hello I want to read to you from Revelation chapter one let's go there beginning in verse 7 I've got several verses to read here and they're very familiar to you this is a beautiful revelation of Jesus in Revelation chapter one uh I want you to know that John starts out with his greetings and his salutations and I I'd like to to correct us a little bit this morning because sometimes when we're giving the address of a scripture we will say Revelations chapter 1. but that book is not called Revelations that book is called revelation because it's actually not a book of many Revelations like some people teach it's actually a book of one revelation yes it's introduced I'm not speaking on that this morning but it's introduced in chapter one this is the Revelation not the Revelation like the Catholic Church says in our Bible it's not the revelation of Saint John the Divine oh no no no this is the revelation of Jesus Christ and all other Mysteries and all other Revelations and all other truths fall under the umbrella of the revelation of Jesus Christ so it's the Revelation Revelation chapter one and John gives his greetings as salutations as he opens this uh Book of Revelation in chapter one and then he comes down to verse 7 and he says behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all kindreds of the Earth shall wail because of him even so a man now this is not speaking about the Rapture this is not the resurrection Rapture of Christ this is the second coming of Christ this is what we really refer to as the revelation of Christ that's really his second coming is is his Revelation because in the Rapture we're not seeing him until we get to where he is and the other citizens of the earth they don't see him in the cloud they don't even know he's there they don't know that the bride has been caught up into another dimension into another realm they most of the time they just keep on going right like they've been going brother random said you're you're not getting it right if you've got this picture of of angels coming down and and digging out the graves and the Saints getting up he said you'll pass by the cemetery and it's undisturbed you'll never know the dead in Christ got up they don't get up by kicking the dirt out of their way it's a it's a change anybody following me and they used to show movies that's Left Behind series and some of the paintings that went behind some of that church annity it really is what it was they've got a cars you know veering off the highway and planes veering off in the sky they're unmanned and and what a chaos but the reality is the rapture is not for The Universal Church the Rapture is for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen those who have already washed their robes in the blood of the lamb and those who have had their garments purified by the word so it's not just the blood that purifies us it's the revealed word of the hour that also cleanses us and gets all the spots and wrinkles off of our garment so that we can go in that Resurrection Rapture the church Universal goes into that last portion of the tribulation and many give their lives for Christ now you say that's a mighty awful thing no it's actually a glorious thing that they get an opportunity to get their robes clean because the universal church is dirty she spotted by man's Traditions she spotted by man's doctrines she spotted by misinterpretations of the word I wish somebody would help me today you know her gospel today is this don't judge this is the gospel of the modern Church don't judge you can't let anybody feel bad nobody should feel bad about what they do or how they live or who they sleep with we got to include them all that's not the Gospel of Jesus Christ that's not what the word says so the universal church has got some purging to go through while the bride is being purged in this hour you're going through you're purging Now The Universal Church goes through her purging then now what we have to remember I'm ahead of myself but what we have to remember is we must not get our eyes on the pollution of the church at Large when we speak of the church we should speak of the Bride church and the bride church is perfect as he is perfect somebody said well I look around here and I see a bunch of imperfect people we ain't talking about people we're not talking about an organization we're talking about a congregation we're not talking about a location we're talking about a Mystic body this mystical body of Jesus Christ is pure and perfected by the blood of the Lamb by the word of her testimony by the righteousness of the word plans amen and so we need to get a little revelation of that that when we're looking at each other when we start seeing the flaws in one another we're looking at the right the wrong thing we're looking at the wrong thing and when you're looking at the wrong thing you can't just ask for whatever you want to ask for and it be handed to you come on when you're looking at the wrong thing let me say this again I'm going to have to work a little harder today when you are looking at the wrong thing you don't you don't just use prayer like some kind of magic uh charm you know well I can just I can look at whatever I want to and live any way I want to live but prayer will always work that's not right and anybody that's been in the faith long at all knows that it just don't work that way this is not a lucky rabbit's foot that you carry around on your keychain this is not a horseshoe over your door this has got to be God's way or it don't work at all and so I encourage you to get your eyes off the church I encourage you to get your eyes off The Universal Church she's lukewarm at best get your eyes off of her we don't have time to spend all of our time in here talking about how filthy she is because when you're looking at the wrong thing you can ask what you will [Music] it's only when you're focusing on the right thing the right one it's only when you're looking at the full revelation of Jesus Christ he is not are you with me then every now and again look up this way I may not be pretty but I'm the man for the hour I just want to know you're here this unveiling of Jesus Christ is such an important thing the apocalipsis it's why we have the revelation now remember there are some of us who know that if we really want to get the church ages we go right back to the tapes everything else we look at We compare it to what the message has already taught us especially when we're dealing with Dr levale's book we always want to bring that back because there's a paragraph or two that's been troubling me one this particular week because Brother Joseph was quoting that in his weekly letter to the Saints and it disturbs me just a little bit because brother Branham never says it it's never said in the message of the hour it's in reference to the seventh Church age messenger and his responsibility uh the church age book tells us something like this he is to reveal all the Mysteries including the seven Thunders and brother Branham does not say that in the message of the hour that is that is a little bit of Lee vale's interpretation because as long as brother Branham was alive Dr Vale put everything in brother Branham soon as brother Branham died brother Vale put everything in himself [Music] I'm just telling it like it is this don't matter to some of you visitors because you don't even know but I'm talking about the seven Church age book which is a wonderful tool and is full of tremendous truth but the problem is in that book in that time that that was being written brother Vale believed that brother Branham was to do everything including being the angel that John was falling before he had all kinds of thoughts and placed everything in brother random but not too long after brother Branham passed away Dr Vale decided that he was called to correct the mistakes that brother Branham had made in his own ministry that's a dangerous mistake come on now because now you've gotta you've got a quotation out there that Dr Vale did not believe in the latter part of his ministry but you've got the bride out there most of which don't know any different because if the church age book said it it's just the same as brother random preaching it under inspiration hello I know this is a little controversial that's why I don't get to preach the youth camps anymore controversial he didn't believe that everything was hanging in that messenger he believed that there was a bride that was going to follow a many membered bride the adopted sons of God who were going to look at the right thing and because they were focusing on the Lord Jesus and not a prophet because they were focusing on the Lord Jesus and not brother Branham they were going to be able to do the Greater Works of Jesus Christ in the Earth that's what I'm preaching and that's what I'm believing brother the Branham didn't take everything and place it in himself placed it in a people that would take the truth that was restored by that messenger back to the Bible because the foundation of all truth has to be God it has to be the word of God did I lose some of my help maybe I lost some streamers I don't know but they just keep spitting out the same error doesn't produce life doesn't produce Deliverance it doesn't produce hope because it puts everything behind us and I don't know about you but if this is the millennium I am really disappointed if this is my new body oh Lord hello I sit down in the chair for an hour and get up and I'm stiff anybody know what it feels like yeah you're right across town and you're going to get out and and you're stiff and you got to get I finally get lubricated a while after a while I get going I I find myself stumbling around like I used to never stumble around before and my foot hangs on things and if this is the new body then I don't have enough hope to quit preaching let's go home oh no this isn't a millennium no this isn't the new body oh no the bride hasn't had her Revival yet when she does the true revelation of those seven unknown Thunders will be known and it will produce in her a faith for the rapture that's what he said that's when these old bodies change they change because of Revelation Revelation changes this body right now Revelation is changing the Inner Man you wait until Revelation starts changing the outer body [Applause] what happened to brother soda he got that Revelation the Holy Ghost is just making the word real to him and he's moving like a younger person somebody said I don't believe that's biblical don't tell Abraham that don't tell Abraham that that recognizing the right person won't change your body when Abraham got a revelation of who was talking to him in the tent it changed his physical body and even though Sarah laughed at it initially there's room for some of the rest of you Sarahs come on I just want to welcome you Sarah's out there who laughed at this stuff originally I want you to know her body was changed too [Applause] because she followed her Lord who was her Lord Abraham the Bible tells us that Sarah called Abraham Lord she knew that he was the source now that doesn't mean uh what a lot of people would like for it to mean it doesn't mean that the woman is supposed to be you know a rug for you to step on you sorry excuse for a man [Applause] you need to hear what the prophet said because he took it from the word she's your queen [Music] I don't care how uh flawed she is how human she may be she's your queen and the Bible tells us the way to help her change is to love her like Christ loved the church I'm getting some I'm seeing some husband-wife nudges in here I love it I'm seeing some folks Hallelujah just don't throw them amen bombs when you're sitting right next to your wife and you want her to hear something you say [Music] instead of doing that and distracting us all why don't you just punch her and say he's preaching at you oh I'm having too much fun the holy cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him and all Kindred to the Earth shall well because of him even so amen I am Alpha and Omega it'd be wonderful if Jesus said that but he didn't speak Greek he spoke Aramaic which was Loosely based on Hebrew so he probably said I am the elephant the top but to me it doesn't matter if it was a and z or Alpha and Omega or aleph I get the point because he goes on to elaborate the beginning and the ending I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending saith the Lord and if you don't know how long he was he said which is and which was and which is to come the almighty Jesus just called himself be Almighty Jesus just told John I'm God damn I'm him I'm not just here to represent him I am him come on let's read on John who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ was in The Isle that is called Patmos now now Patmos means Loosely the meaning of the root of Patmos is my killing so John is actually saying I am in the aisle or I was in the aisle that is called my killing because if you're ever going to see a revelation that means you've got to get beyond your own thinking you've got to get beyond your own church entity your own indoctrination and you've got to begin to see him and if you get a revelation that doesn't line up with the message of the hour that lines up with the word God didn't send it let me just make sure you understand if you get some idea that doesn't line up with the message of truth that lines up with the word God didn't send it let me make sure you understand what I'm saying today if you get some idea that you believe is a revelation that doesn't fit the message of truth that lines up with the word of God God didn't send it it may be a good idea but it might not be a god idea you may believe something there may be some truth to it but you can't make a Doctrine out of anything that doesn't line up with that revelation of Jesus Christ which is based directly on the word I've got to hurry he was on Patmos for the word of God I can't even tell you that some of the things he went through before he got there but for one they tried to make a French fry out of John they tried to boil him in oil now I don't know what they call that where you're from but where I'm from they call that fry when you boil something in oil you fry it so they tried to fry the Revelation out of John but he was born for a purpose and that was to see Jesus unveiled the devil the leader see a revelation [Applause] the devil can't kill you [Applause] not even your foolishness can kill you if you were born to see a revelation until you see that revelation God will hang you around you'll hang around because of him if he has to put you on a nail somewhere he'll hang you around until you see what you're supposed to see because God takes that election predestination foreknowledge very serious is anybody helping me I don't even know all right he goes on and he says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day I don't have time you know me I'd love to preach that that's not Sabbath that's not Sunday that's the Lord's day I read a commentary recently where a path preacher said that couldn't be the Lord's day because the Lord's day was full of Wrath and judgment and that and that John wasn't caught up to the day of the Wrath and judgment so that had to be on a Sunday and I've read that the messianics say it had to be on a Saturday and the truth is it's my day he saw my day John saw the last hour John saw the closing hours he saw a lot more than that but he saw the closing hours of laodicea he saw right where we are in the church age plan of God right now I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard listen now you've got to catch this and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet now what did the verse say before before that he said behold he cometh not the not the verse directly before it but the verse that we started with said behold he cometh with the clouds and every eye shall see him and they also which pierced him in all kindreds of the Earth shall well because of him even so amen we mentioned that that's the second coming that's the ushering end of the kingdom of God and he said that again that second coming is the ushering end of the kingdom of God the breaking forth of the millennial Dawn are you following me so guess what John was looking at he was looking at the breaking forth of the millennial Dawn he was looking forth at the Kingdom notice where the voice came The Voice didn't come from the kingdom and speak directly face to face with John The Voice came from the church age I'll show you I'll show you he said I Heard a Voice I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet now here's John looking at the Kingdom but the voice didn't speak to John from Kingdom the The Voice spoke to John from church he had to turn around I hope you'll follow this go back one verse charity I'm sorry I'm working you extra hard as of a trumpet I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet now let's read on saying I am Alpha and Omega first and the last and what thou see is right in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus unto Smyrna under pergamus unto thyterra unto Sardis unto Philadelphia and under laodicea seven churches in Asia Minor most commentators agree that this was not just speaking about characteristics of seven local churches in Asia Minor but it was also prophetically speaking of of Ages of church ages to come where these Spirits these uh characteristics these attributes would be predominantly on display in a particular period of History which is so fascinating that every attribute that was going to be brought to us through the church ages and all seven Church ages of History was all present in the Earth at the same time in seven churches these are not the only churches that there were and these are not the only churches in Asia mind or that there were but these were seven churches that had so much in them so much going on in them that they actually became a prophetic symbol of everything listen of everything that God would do Ephesus to laodicea interesting to study that God wasn't going to do anything Church without it being from Ephesus all the way across the church ages down to laodicea and everything the spirit of the Overcomer was in the church and the spirit of the age was in the church at one particular time but it was also prophesying of seven Church ages of History most of you should be very familiar with that now let's go on and I turned and I turned he's already looking at Kingdom but God was not going to reveal the kingdom to him until he revealed the church to him he had to see what God was going to be in the churches what God was going to do in the church ages before he could see what God was going to do in the Kingdom now if you follow the book of the Revelation you'll find out that there is Kingdom revealed Revelation 19 Begins the revelation of the Kingdom I saw a white horse rider I saw one on a white horse he's faithful and true coming with myriads of Angels the Saints riding white horses I'm not quoting it directly but you understand uh should I I I I don't want to do that right now but I've maybe someone um give me Revelation 19 would you I don't I have all my scriptures printed and I don't have that out and it's just 12 52. you read it you read it Elias well we ought to get David Shirley to read it really shouldn't we but we'll we'll settle for Elias we like you Elias you do very well what's that yeah go back to your seat there and read it read uh tell him what to read yeah there it is oh you can just read it up there they'll give you a few verses stand up so they can see you and hear you and I saw heaven open beautiful and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war now tell me where we're reading since we can't see it there Revelation 19 what 1911 Revelation 19 11. now we're going into 12. read it for us his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself no man knew and he was clothed with a Vester dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God praise God and the armies and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon the white horses wow you people that are scared of horses read on clothed and fine linen white and clean praise God the bride the Bride of every age coming back with him riding white horses dressed in fine linen which is the righteousness of of God in the Saints white and clean read a little more maybe and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword that with it he should smites that the Nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treteth the wine press of the fierceness and Wrath of almighty God Amen brother that's great reading thank you so much let's thank God for Elias doing that for us now that's the kingdom coming revelation 19. John was looking at trying to look at the Kingdom in Revelation 1. but John wasn't going to be able to understand the coming of the Kingdom until he understood what God was going to do in the church ages so the voice that came to him didn't come before him the voice came behind him and so he had to turn toward the voice let's go back to Revelation 1 and get those verses there and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks which we know were lamps and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with a golden girdle we're going all the way to verse 18. his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet like undefined brass as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many Waters and he hath in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp to edge sword does this sound like the same Christ to you that we just read about in Revelation 19. it is all right and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when I saw him tell us what happened I fell at his feet as dead I I I John I John was looking at the Kingdom but I couldn't understand the kingdom now now this should answer a question because sometimes people come around and they say why are they always talking about the seven Church ages why are they always talking about church history and how God moved in those seven ages of church history here's why you can't understand the coming Kingdom until you understand how God moves in the church you've got to see the church ages before you can see listen you've got to see the church ages before you understand the seals you've got to see where God was where he is and where he's going to be and you've got to see it all at the same time and there's no way that our little human mind could do that unless the Holy Spirit quickens the word and makes it alive to us like a revelation and I want you to know you can't whip the Devil with a shout you can't whip the Devil with a jump you can't whip the devil with tongues and interpretation but you can whip the Devil with a revelation you get you a revelation of the word and there's not a devil that can stand before you because you don't meet him with your sensation you don't meet him with your emotion you meet him with the revelation of the word he can't stand that you see you you I believe in jumping around you know I'm going to have I'm going to have a church that's alive I am not going to Pastor a church that's dead I'm not going to spend my time worshiping with people that could care less about worship I'm too old for that I mean it I'm too over that in fact I'm not going to sit in too many services I don't have to somebody said aren't you going to the meeting there aren't you going to the meeting there no I don't have to sit in a dead service you go take some life to them let me stay plugged in here so I can help you when you get back because sometimes you come back shouting the Victory and sometimes you come back limping hey because it's not a party out there there's a devil that's against what you carry there's demons that are against the truth that you possess you get whipped sometime and you don't even know who's whipping you you don't even know where the licks are coming from hello so here's John when I saw him when I saw this glorified Christ the last time I saw him he didn't look like this remember [Music] now he's glorified oh and I fell at his feet as a dead man he laid his right hand upon me and said unto me what we all want to hear him say sometime fear not I'm the first and the last that's just a little wake-up alarm hello [Music] I don't know what you have your Monday morning alarm set for but I wished I did because I'd play it in here sometime when you're sleeping you I guarantee you some of you jump up and start to get us try to look for the shower you'd look for the coffee pot or the shower some of you get such a long nap you wouldn't know where you was when you woke up I'm afraid hello don't worry John I am he that liveth and was dead all of that and behold I Am Alive forevermore oh I'm done with the debt you know what he's saying to John I'm done with the death stuff the keys of hell and of death he said in the verses that we just read he said I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet these words are very significant they make known to us the position of John his back toward the Church his face toward the kingdom John heard the voice behind him the voice was in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks or lap stands the churches therefore we know John's back was to the churches and his face was toward the kingdom of God even at that early date but God said John you first got to get what I'm doing here what I have done what I will do and then I'm going to let you see my kingdom so this is why when the revelation of Jesus Christ began to come he brought through that Prophet the church age is first before the seals because you can't see Kingdom that's out there you can't see Kingdom until you understand Church yeah and if you've heard that revelation of Jesus Christ series we call the church ages if you've heard that revelation of Jesus Christ series you've seen the church if you've heard that you've seen the church and he lays it out I'm telling you he lays it out like a man with an education and he had no had no education now Matthew chapter 6 I'll hurry I don't know why I've got another hour Matthew chapter 6 verse 31 therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed hmm all that flirting and worrying we do over where we're gonna go eat [Music] and the Bible said don't even worry about it just just go husbands and wives nearly filed papers over trying to decide where to go eat just go just go eat don't let that torment you if you miss the sale at Old Navy don't worry about it God's not gonna let you be naked if you find out your clothes come from China wear them anyhow somebody said they're full of chemicals they're going to kill us God will take care of you just wash them real good and come on don't get so caught up I said to I said to Jennifer and Josiah last Sunday because their Lord have mercy they said to said to me like well you know this all this strain of making these choices sit just just kind of Genesis put a little strain on us I said well of course it does it did all the rest of us too it seemed like that helped her so much maybe if I had some time I could sit down and tell her and and Josiah what I've been through with some of your weddings I honestly wanted some of you just I just wanted to put the broom out there and tell you to jump it let's just jump over the broom in Jesus name amen do we get so carried away so worried I don't mean your day shouldn't be amazing your your wedding day should be amazing but we get so carried away so caught up families get so divided everybody has an opinion you all would have made wonderful Jews everybody has an opinion they don't ever ever give it when it's needed only when it's unsolicited do they start popping in even men become fashionistas hello all caught up in these things that are not going to matter past the pictures poor poor fiancee's worried that they can hardly look at each other they get so perturbed over one another and all the things that go on in some of these weddings you know brother sister Comfort one another let these young people know that it's going to be okay you get this behind you and then you you go on to the real troubles [Music] people's been quiet all morning if you can't get along in choosing colors what you gonna do when you have to wake up beside her we need to focus on Kingdom take no thought for after all these things do the do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that ye have need of all these things my God don't he know don't he know that we have to be clothed doesn't he know that we have to feed the children doesn't he know that we have to pay the bill doesn't God know come on folks doesn't he know can you trust him has he ever failed you has he ever given you a reason to doubt him can't you put it in his hands and not get so worked up about it hello are you with me but but here is the key here is the key Broad [Applause] John couldn't see the kingdom until he saw the church ages broad you have seen the church ages the voice that's talking to you now is not behind you the voice that God is speaking to you with now is in front of you and he's leading us to the kingdom it's the promised land before us we're getting our eyes on the promise we can't spend our time focusing on the flaws of the modern day Church they use smoke machines so what I don't care I don't care if they blew I don't care if they blow red white and blue smoke every Sunday and sip their Starbucks and eat Krispy Kreme I am not turning around no to catch myself up in what the church is doing got my eyes on the kingdom you ought to help me a little bit while I have charismatic friends that go to churches that have tattoo parlors attached yes I do I don't care I don't want a tattoo I'm not looking for a tattoo not looking for a piercing [Music] I don't want a Christmas tree I sure don't want an ear Bob anybody with me I'm not studying the ways of the heathen let them do what they want to do let them do how they want to do don't get your eyes on that 55-minute service 10 minutes for announcements sing for 45. that leaves what about 60 seconds we're preaching then you've got churches where everybody in the church has to sing a song everybody has to sing a song everybody everybody has to sing a song just about every service everybody has to sing a song that's a concert nothing wrong with having a concert we can have a concert sometime we can have a sing sometime we can have everybody come and sing two or three songs and hear everybody sing a song we can come for that purpose but that's not why we came this morning I want to hear from you I want to hear your songs if you you tell us you've got a song to sing we're most likely going to hear it we love it I love when people sing Under The anointing but I know churches for everybody and his brother and sisters got to sing whether they can or not but I can't worry about that let them do it I know churches where the church age book is the most sacred book they carry it around with their Bible like it's like it's you know gold or something I don't care I can't put my eyes on the church hello God keep my eyes on the kingdom can't spend all my Ministry preaching against them [Music] I gotta lead you to the rapture we got to move together toward the kingdom hello so many trinitarian churches out there can't help it can't spend all my time preaching against trinitarian churches they're going to be there always will be there yes they wear ball caps to church cargo shorts [Music] miniskirts can't help it can't help what they do that's what they do we know it we see it we hear it they bring their Starbucks right into the sanctuary with them they're ready to have church women in tight slacks prophesy air bobs painted up to me some of the ugliest women in the world are former Holiness women because once they get free they look like clowns clowns they just paint up they just don't know where to stop they're not just putting on a layer of color they're putting on everything nobody's lips are way out here but that is what the church does how am I going to help you by spending all my time talking about what the churches do John couldn't see the kingdom in its fullness and understand it until first God took him back to the churches we've been to the church ages how many of you been through the church ages we've heard it we've been in this thing a long time we know how that spirit moves we know how that trail of the serpent moved through the church ages we understand that we know how we understand the seals now we see how the horse riders changed we see how the church was preaching that that the first seal was Jesus Christ and we come to find out it's not Jesus Christ in the first seal it's the Antichrist you'd think that makes a little bit of difference if we're preaching all day that that's Christ and come to find out it's the Antichrist so look get your eyes off the church ages [Applause] I'm coming home in just a minute you believe me you got to see the kingdom now let's come on down to our church anybody want to spend some time here just a moment let's come down to our church we got flaws you be careful how you amen because these are my youngins and you know how mamas and daddies are about their youngins I know they have flaws I know they I know they need a spanking a gospel whipping at least once a week I know these people but you be careful how you amen because these are my children understand what I'm trying to tell you I can say what I need to say to him but you be careful are you with me you look around this church you'll see that there are people that don't always keep the standard you'll see there are women who need a little more material men who need a little more cloth some strange things people do with their hair sometimes chemical infusion perms or whatever the some of some of the stuff the world does every now and again I see a somebody with a clear polish on their nails and I see some of the girls start off with a thread around their wrist is some little meaning some little meaning in the next thing you know it it begins to look more and more like jewelry see all that but I I compel you in the name of the Lord to get your eyes off the church because you are not the one called to set the church where it needs to set you get your eyes on the kingdom you can't do your job in my job too you can't do your job in brother Greeley's job too you can only do your job you get your eyes on him I said well I think that one may have a spirit on them you're probably right but if you go around looking for who's got a spirit on them you're you're constantly looking over your shoulder you're not looking at the Kingdom preach brother [Music] preach brother now why are you even preaching this because I'm preaching on ask abundantly oh let me let me get on that because sometimes people say I don't think the children ought to run around like that why why you you let them run bloody murder everywhere they go come on brother well I don't think you see those kids run up there and uh one hug the pastor or brother Greely or whatever after the survey why does that bother you [Music] if somebody if one of these children wants to call me Pap Pap what is that to you [Music] oh it's quiet ain't it you think I'm being ugly and I'm really I'm not even nearer I'm not near as serious as you think I am but I am but I can tell by the look on your face that you think I think that I'm really straightening it out and that ain't even what I'm getting to oh I love it this way I love it when you think I'm madder than I am I'm just I'm I'm getting to something I'm getting this I I'm getting there brother Austin said well let's hear it I'm getting there I'm on my way it takes some of us longer to get there than it does others but I'm headed there I want you to be able to ask abundantly I want you to be able to get what you ask I want you to see that God does not want to live in a little limited box I want you to be able to have what you pray I want you to begin to see the answer to your prayers and I want to tell you that you can't as long as you're looking at the church John couldn't hear what he'd had to hear on Patmos if he would have only been looking somewhere God wasn't talking God wasn't Kingdom talking yet he was church talking so John had to turn to see the church the message of the Hour come we saw the church now it's time to see the kingdom anybody with me so here's the three steps to overcoming keep your eyes on Jesus and off of everybody else keep your eyes on Jesus off of everybody else keep your eyes on Jesus off of everybody else don't you spend time looking at the church is flawed do you know why because there's flawed people here do you know why because there's a flawed Pastor here we are human and we don't always do it right you go out of here Sunday I don't do I don't think we ought to call off for service for Fourth of July it's a good thing you're not making the decisions we didn't have an election we didn't take a vote we did what we felt like we ought to do why do you let that bother you why would you even Grumble about it why would you even repeat it why would you even let it be a bother to you get your eyes off the church you need to see the kingdom Church Ages come seals come now we can see the kingdom of God and if we see the kingdom of God we can ask what we will and it shall be done our prayers are often hindered by what we look at let me preach on the television let me preach on the filth and the slop and the garbage and the pornography and and the sports that eats Us Alive with their filth commercial so full of Filth you feed on that you if you constantly look you are on here look this there's a woman on my road God bless her heart brother Greely has seen her she's an older lady not old but slightly older than me and she likes to walk at least she's walking I told her kids coming at least she's moving a lot of people her age are playing games on their phone on the couch at least she's walking up the road but it doesn't make a lot of sense to walk up the road where cars Zoom around play in a game because one of these days Ben will come by our brother Greeley for that matter or Zach and run them in the ditch run her off in the ditch because you're not constantly expecting somebody to be out there she needs to look up one day I'm up and rolled the window down and say mama I don't want you to be a hood ornament on my Ford people get we used to say they're drunk now we say they're on the phone hello distraction distraction distraction distraction it'll lead us alive it'll steal our joy it'll cause us to look back to the church ages it doesn't mean we're not going to teach the truth of the church ages it means we've been there we've done that we can't look at that all the time the church out there is corrupt the church in here is not pure because we're working toward Perfection get your eyes off of each other get your eyes off of your pastor and see Jesus see the kingdom verse 33 but seek ye first seek ye first no seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you that word seek there you're still with me do I have a few more minutes [Laughter] God bless you brother cephas I don't know you particular brother but he said I've been listening to Pastor Shelley since the 90s nice to see he's still holding on God bless you sir I am by the grace of God and when I can't hold on he holds on isn't that it came first that word it means to look for to be passionate about it means to be consumed with finding do you know what would happen to this body of Believers if if half of us if a third of us would leave with a determination to be consumed with finding the kingdom [Applause] quit looking at that crazy uncle of yours he's always going to be your uncle he's probably always going to be crazy passionately seek the kingdom that's what I'm saying get your eyes off of the church families that don't do just like you want them to do and you know and they look at you funny I I tell you the next person who tells me I wasn't mad while ago but I'm about to feel mad right now he looked at me funny you big crybaby I'm being honest what are you for preach brother you are funny sometime no wonder somebody looked at you funny I passed my pastor and he didn't even wave at me in the car that's because I didn't see you I don't even know what you drive ask my wife ask my children I don't even know what you people drive I drive up here on Sunday and I'll say well whose car is that Ben's I don't I don't I know that you got here I'm thankful that you had a way to get here I I'm sorry Luke I know what you drive so if you ain't Luke I ain't looking I'm having too much fun Lord help me when Luke pulls in with that 18-wheeler you can't miss him grow up grow up he may have looked at you funny cause he's going through something he might have looked right through you he may not have even been looking at you she may have been looking through you grow up seek the kingdom of God if a third of us would go out of here seeking passionately to operate in the Kingdom in righteousness in joy in peace in the Holy Ghost In Loving kindness Temperance and patience and godliness come on if we would passionately seek to operate in the Kingdom instead of operating the flesh or operate in the church ages some of the stuff that God tolerated in the church ages he will not tolerate in the kingdom and I think some of us know that and that's why we don't have that passion I don't want to have prayer lines until the rapture [Music] so I got a few more minutes I'm taking them when we did prayer lines in the 90s we were criticized and now they have one at least in every meeting thrilled I'm thrilled the only thing I want to know is this they told us then that we were Beyond them when when is somebody going to say oops I'm waiting on a letter don't you think I'm waiting not I'm looking I'm looking at the Kingdom but I'm waiting on a letter to say you know brother Shelley we really took you to task because you had prayer lines criticized because we let sisters pray for sisters it is ridiculous there's neither male nor female with God it's not a woman's place to handle the word she has every right to every spiritual gift except handling the word all these things and now there's at least one prayer line to end every meeting which I think is wonderful and here's what's so funny is I'm coming along here on a Sunday morning and I'm telling you I don't want to have prayer lines until the rapture I don't want to leave here so tired I can't hardly get out of the chair the rest of the day I want to go and we haven't had a prayer line in a while so I'm not talking about that it's the pull of the word that wears me out sometime or or put it's either one or two things either the word pulling me or you or me pulling you but I leave here pretty tired but here's what I'm trying to say we won't always need a per line we're looking at the Kingdom I hope you don't criticize me for saying that prayer lines are Church ages you know somebody said well uh we need the altars you know the new churches they're building they're not even putting an altar there I said well I'm not I mean I think there should be an altar but I'm not really going to criticize that because we don't use the ones we have much but it's not a piece of furniture that we need to preach back in the church I could cause I could do a Blog I think I'll do a Blog on putting the altar back in the church what would be the good in getting somebody to bring a piece of furniture back when we're no longer in the church ages anyway we're moving beyond now we're so close to the kingdom that that Veil gets thin sometime and we start tasting of the power of the ages to come whoa and when that breaks out Among Us you won't have to get down here on your knees and crawl and big and plead and you won't have to line up out the back door for the preacher to pray for you Hallelujah you'll sit under the anointed word of God and receive your miracles [Music] but we'll never be there if all we do is look at the church either the false church or The Universal Church that will be redeemed or our church every church has got its pimples and hiccups and crooked noses and quit looking at them you're still at this stage worried that there might be some services that I don't come out and shake hands when I feel like I've drugged people for two hours I'm you're heavy sometime and and you know maybe maybe before 50 I didn't have to go to the bathroom for several hours but at this point by the last I mean I could go right now by the time the last amen is said I need to go and what do you think it feels like as I go out there out of the room sometime I'm coming back a lot of the time I'm coming back and you're calling me brother Shelley brother Shelley brother Shelley brother Shelly by the Shelley and I'm thinking oh my if I could just you know maybe maybe I should look into a catheter or something I don't know for long Sundays don't get somebody am I offending you wow all of a sudden I caught a few people that look like I've just crossed the line you ain't seen nothing this is sanitized why would it matter Why doesn't search don't look at each other don't look at what the church out there is doing and get word about it don't compare your church to somebody else's church because we got our own share of flaws there is no one right Church it's not a building it's not a local congregation it's bigger than that it's Kingdom and in the Kingdom as we begin to Break Forth in the kingdom of God we don't have to cry we don't have to beat the Rock again we speak to the Rock and the water comes we don't cry we speak but until then until then we ought to be crying I need a few more minutes thank you God commissioning Moses I am on Page Three I thought well I'll do so good my family will be so proud of me I only have 12 pages and I'll be done I'll be done early and uh and I've talked about everything but what I should talk about probably is you're thinking I'm just giving you an example I'm just helping you to see don't be scared to ask don't be afraid to shout don't be afraid to dance just make sure you're living right that's a fair ask isn't it you have not you have not because you ask not that's just what the word said but listen what brother random said he said you ask not because you believe not you don't ask because you don't believe if you believe you'll ask and you won't ask meagerly you'll ask abundantly amen Brother David can I use your little thing as an example Brother David had a hard thing I won't go into detail every detail of it but Brother David had a hard thing recently found out that he was let me see how to say it nice he was not being paid what he was worth he knew that all along but sometimes you swallow it because you you understand that everybody's trying to do what they can to get by and whatever else but when you start finding out that you're you're below new hire is that ugly to say is that too much information when you find out that you're faithful you have a harder job than most and you're below new hire you you you can do a lot you can stomp in and quit get mad or you can ask sister Sandy reached out and she said I want to know about them anointed rocks you were talking about he said where do we put them I loved that but God was already on the case Brother David just wrote a letter and asked I read the letter he may not know it did you send it to me sister Sandy I read the letter I thought it was amazing I thought it was so well done not not a why me I'm mistreated no no no very professional when can we meet to talk about this oh I love it I don't know the details now I've been out of touch with the details all I know is I got a text he said I got a raise [Applause] it works in the natural many times it always works in the spiritual ask don't be scared to ask there are people in this room that have been afraid to do what he did I'm not lifting him up putting you down I'm telling you it pays to get a little boldness sometimes do it in the right spirit I admire him for it don't be scared to ask ask abundantly you have not because you're astronaut you ask not because you believe not ask a whole lot God will give you a whole lot have a lot of faith a fella told me the other day he said he was riding in an old Model T Ford yet said one day happened to get some good faith and God gave him a Buick he said I got a Buick faith I'm praying for Cadillac faith now how many of you would condemn that as charismatic name it and claim it hello a lot of people would and you remember the old Ford that brother Branham drove that wasn't his only vehicle you know don't you you do know he had a Cadillac don't you and does anybody care I could care less he could have had one for both legs and I wouldn't have cared do you understand what I'm saying don't you get some critical spirit on you because you can't keep yours running somebody said what does anybody need a Cadillac I don't know if they need it or not but I'll tell you the vehicle I drive cost exactly exactly what Cadillacs did about 10 15 20 years ago listen to what brother Graham said about the man moving from Model T to Buick Faith to Cadillac Faith he said all right that's good that's right keep on it's so quiet I love this as we all go out of here in our foreign made little cars God will give it he's gotten forward faith so stay with the Ford then yes laughs come on I may not have the hat and I may not have the belt buckle but I drive the Ford no he said let's get a little more faith he's telling you not to stay with forward faith have faith for what you want you ought to be ashamed of yourself for wanting more than what you've got that's false Doctrine I'm going to give you the truth of that you ought to be ashamed of yourself for wanting more than what you've got when you refuse to look at the right thing God's not going to give you better when you criticize everybody around you I may not know what people drive but I guarantee you there's people in this church that know what people drive and what they paid for it because they Googled it and blue booked it and looked it up and hello what does it matter get your eyes off of that then you've got some people that have got a new vehicle and don't even want to drive it around Church Folks because they feel they feel that someone might say something about it I pray in the name of the Lord that you will not have your eyes on each other like that I feel something good here today I'm being rough with the visitors here I shouldn't preach like this I ought to be on my best behavior with visitors here hold on to it he said he's got forward Faith just stay with the Ford then that's all right let's get a little more faith all right that's what brother random's telling us now in a message where I think Pentecost failed let's go there quickly oh the time the time the time and God will never you can never exhaust God's love and mercy to you you say well I hate to bother you so much father I'll be honest with you I don't pray I don't say that I never tell the Lord It's Me Again I know you're tired of hearing from me because I have a revelation you see to me that's really false humility that's not based on faith it's based on Pride you don't have to come to God like oh I know you're tired of seeing me he wants to be bothered that way he does don't never think that you could ever ask too much of God he said I believe the scripture said you have not because you ask not you asked not because you believe not he wants us to ask and believe that our Joys would be full he wants you to ask abundantly ask for big things don't limit your faith to some little Mustard Seed get on out here to some other kind of faith and move out in big things now remember remember if you've got your eyes on this world you'll be struggling over here between Buick faith and forward faith but when you get your eyes on the kingdom your asks will change it'll change it'll change what you ask for ask big things big things is just as easy to receive in little things you just have to believe that's all and you've got faith just know exactly how to use it and it'll be all right you can put it right to work and it'll just it'll just be fine could you imagine talking about exhausting God's love and power and beneficiaries for you could you imagine a little bitty fishy about that long way out here in the middle of the ocean say now wait a minute I better consider this thing I better drink of this water sparingly uh wow how many little minutes how many little minnows are in here they get that kind of mentality well I better be careful you know I I don't want to drink too much to me it's like those same naysayers you know you better be careful how excited you get you better be careful how emotional you get you're very careful because you don't want to run out one day or something like that like that little fish way out there in the middle of the ocean say now wait a minute I better consider this thing I better drink of this water sparingly because I might run out someday a little fish about that big in the middle of this ocean out here well that could get that could easily be done more easier than you could ask too much of God it'd be easier for the little bitty fish to drink all the water in the ocean then for you to ask too much of God that is good he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life would you say that with me he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life inexhaustible it just keeps on pouring whatever you have need of ask him and believe it your asks will change when you're looking at the Kingdom when you're looking at the Kingdom you're more concerned about what pleases him then you are what pleases you when you're looking at the Kingdom you're more concerned about what how God wants to use that situation than telling God how you want the situation to be if you're if you will understand that we ask God what we want what we hope for what we'd like to be but we've got to have an attitude toward him Lord you know best father you know best father you know best I'm asking I'm asking for this but I what I really want is what pleases you so do you think do you think it's wrong to ask abundantly not according to the word you can preface you can you can add an addendum the end of that you can do however you want to but Lord what I really want is to please you and here's something else to add in there I'm going to praise you for the Buick just like I'd praise you for the forges like I'd pray you together I'm going to say every good thing comes from you [Applause] thank you I don't want you to miss what I've been preaching this morning I'm I'm wondering if I've got too off track and you're you're going to miss it I hope not he provided it in the redempted blessings when he died at Calvary gave a promise to you for everything you have need of while you're in the journey and it's yours if you'll ask and believe that's right could you imagine a little mouse about so long ago under the great Gardeners of Egypt saying now wait a minute I better not eat but just about two grains a day because I might run out before the Winter's over Keep Us close to you amen well I've done my religion for the day oh he said I'd just like to lay down really and drink in and just have a real spiritual oh let's all fold our hands now and act like church folks that's not what he's saying there he said just have a real spiritual gastronomical Jubilee just drink till you just can't drink no more well I better Pace myself let's go on is that the end of that one yeah what it takes to overcome all unbelief 55. I guess I'll just have to stop he said now how are we planted we're planted in Christ Jesus now I believe just in my estimation of him he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life that you cannot exhaust his goodness come on musicians would you he's the inexhaustible Fountain of Life that you cannot exhaust his goodness some people think oh I hate to call on God so much read that for me that's what he wants you to do you have not because you asked not you ask not because you believe not are you with me that those folks don't need you to watch him walk they've been walking since they were toddlers you have not because you asked not you asked not because you believe not ask abundantly that your Joys might be full that's what God wants ask big things he said I'm asking for hundreds of souls in this meeting he's seeing the kingdom he's seeing the kingdom you know why we don't do you know why there's only a few of us when we say when we say something like uh we're believing this mortgage is going to be paid off by the end of the year you know why there's only a few people that say Man come on because you've already accepted the alternative yes well I just hate to see him brother shelling brother Greeley disappointed sail your cow sell your Cadillac if you really don't want to see us disappointed I can't believe I just said that I mean I have I've just I've just thrown all my decorum away I sound like a money preacher no you don't use it is scary no it's scary I'm not going to agree with you it's scary no I wasn't scared three years ago I can't I don't see the new the new balance foreign may have just you may have read it off it's one one it's less than one what is it 147 000. 323 divide 147 000 by six months no wonder you don't say Amen how much a month does that look impossible we're not looking at it we're looking to him you don't have to not amen because you're afraid that if if something should have revealed and God should say uh I'm going to do something a little different but but it's coming and it'll be you know I don't want you to worry about our faith I don't want you to worry about what we're going to give up and quit and shut the church down I don't want you to worry about me being disappointed in God I want you to understand that the right approach is to always ask and believe that he is able to do exceeding abundantly above what we can even ask or think we want his perfect will we want his perfect plan we want his perfect timing but it's all right to believe that's what God wants ask big things he said I'm asking for hundreds of souls in this meeting I'm asking that every sick person enters that door will go out of here well that's a big one why not that's what you can ask when you're looking at the Kingdom I'm believing it I'm believing that till we go that this won't be another gathering together but it'll be a Revival in Yakima here Satan's kept me out of here long enough and I believe the hour is here for a real sweeping Revival in every church around the country [Music] 60. foreign conference a man said not long ago I don't want to bother God you know I know he is awful busy read what the prophet thought about that I don't want well you can't exhaust His abountiful blessings could you oh there's the same story a little fish out there in the Pacific I better drink this water sparingly because I might run out here he is again the little mouse so big under the great Gardens of Egypt I better eat ration myself this winter to just two grand I might run out before the new Harvest that's ridiculous it's twice that ridiculous a thousand times more to think you can exhaust the Mercies hello help me worship him a minute help me worship him a minute I'm afraid I'll fail him you will I'm afraid if I really start out to follow God I'll fail him you will I'm telling you you likely will but you'll never exhaust his mercies toward you all right he's trying to force it listen why he's trying to what Force his way into you ask abundantly that your Joys might be full no way to exhaust him I don't want him to have to force his way [Music] he said like a pump the more you pump the fresher the water gets glory be to God come on somebody how do I know what to ask for look at the Kingdom look at the Kingdom he said oh and I look at that like that just keep pumping living at the spout hello living at the spout where the glory is coming out he said I like that just keep pumping I'm not quite done a little more just keep pumping living at the spout where the glory is coming out I love that like a pump the more you pump the fresher the water gets how many needs are in here today hold up your hand if you have a need how many has a desire there's something you'd like to see the Lord do you can have those delight yourself in the Lord the Bible said he'll give you the desires of your heart hello I've been asking for wives for people who need them I don't need one come on I've been asking for husbands Godly sold out men for young sisters who need them some of them need them to support them and walk alongside of them and some of them need them to tame them but I've been saying Lord you know I've been asking God for things that uh that are a little bit out of my comfort zone because I as I look at the Kingdom we have a situation that has come up in Jerusalem that I have not mentioned and I'm not going to mention it this morning but it has brought me many sleepless nights and I wake up every day giving it to God and I do real well until somebody asks me only very few people know until somebody asked me have you heard anything and I say no and then and then all that all that fluttering and you know what happens and it is not my responsibility to bring God's will to pass but I've been asking instead of letting instead of letting circumstances intimidate my faith I've been asking God for bigger hello bigger we're gonna need more than what we have needed in the past because there's promises that have been made for this property for the work in Jerusalem that has laid dormant now for these years and and and God has comforted my heart many times by telling me not to worry because sometimes things look very lifeless very dormant and suddenly hello I'm going we're leaving if you raise your hand and said I've got a need I want you to present that need to God today I want you to do it big somebody's here and you need a little help with your water bill I don't want you to say Lord I need to get that water bill paid I want you to put them all in there Lord I'm trusting you add a little something to what you've been asking God for find yourself this week like Elias had this testimony of how God helped him in his moment of Crisis because he spoke let God you know we don't want to we don't want there to have to be adverse circumstances for our faith to grow let's Let It Grow now let's Let It Grow this morning we don't want to have to have harder situations so that we can have greater Faith let's Let it go this morning let's turn it loose this morning let's knock let's ask let's seek let's passionately seek to see the kingdom and what the Kingdom looks like isn't he good just a minute Hallelujah would you worship him just a moment just a moment put your antennas up holy God holy God holy God maybe you feel like standing as some of you did I didn't realize you were some of you were unless maybe you stand you've been sitting a long time now Hallelujah why don't you just allow the Lord to create a praise on your lips just a moment somebody said I don't know what to say just let him create it just let him put something there let him put words there holy is the Lord Holy Is Our God oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah Hallelujah we don't want to hold on to all the church age promises and not move forward and believe for Kingdom promises we don't want to keep our focus on on church and Miss Kingdom come on somebody needs to praise him you don't have to have music you don't have to have come on and feel something trying to open up here just a moment Hallelujah Hallelujah we press on the door you know what I mean press on
