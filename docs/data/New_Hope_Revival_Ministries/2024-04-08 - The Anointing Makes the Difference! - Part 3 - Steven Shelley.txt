grandmother that I mentioned last night she taught me she said you pray every day until you pray through to the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost prays through you don't let a day go by that you don't let the Holy Ghost pray through you because he knows the mind of the spirit and if there's anything that I could say other than his grace of why I have been able to stand for 49 years of ministry it's because he prayed through me it's because of what granny taught me she said you've got to pray till you quit begging and asking and telling God what to do and you let the Holy Ghost pray through you and the answer will come so I I love that I I've never heard that song before until this morning sing the chorus again would you just for Daddy Holy [Music] Spirit through me when I'm touch the Throne

get some rest and we will come back next weekend ready to see and hear from the Lord whatever he has for us we're going to pray for you who are traveling that God will go with you and keep you and bring you back to us if you have a a pen or a paper and you want to mark this down uh our next time together is June 1st and 2nd for our B monthly fellowship meeting and then August 3rd and 4th and then in October we won't have a first weekend Gathering because camp meeting is then and the dates for camp meeting this year here it coincides with the Feast of Tabernacles and we will be worshiping together October the 15th through the 20th and then December 7th and 8th so it's every other month the first weekend of the month we will gather together for a fellowship and it wouldn't it wouldn't be worth the effort if you didn't come and and worship with us and make it a special weekend to every sing sister who prepared food to those of you who committed and followed through God bless you I know it's a sacrifice sometime but we appreciate you doing that we don't want people to make this great sacrifice to come and not be fed and so you you folks may God bless you may he bless you financially to be able to provide for your family and and the next time and bless the hands that prepared it and and and and so forth and and uh want to thank my wife for doing such a wonderful job and making sure that it's organized she not only organizes and works hard she does a lot of the cooking and uh there there's one thing I want to say about her there's a lot of good things to say but one is she's she's a little bit like me in the sense that she's afraid there won't be enough so she does her share and and several other people share I don't think it would hurt if we clapped our hands and thank thanked her Isaiah chapter 52 vers 1 through three I'm going to need your prayer today and I'm going to need your amen uh your support we're thankful for what we're hearing that God is doing among you I know some of you have come to receive something you haven't gotten that yet it's your faith according to your faith let it be done to you somebody said I just don't have the faith you do you do the Bible said you did the Bible said to every man is given the measure of Faith you've got all the faith you need it doesn't take great faith because you've got a great God it just takes a little faith in a great God is that right so Isaiah 52 veres 1-3 uh I have it in the in the new King James I don't know if you pulled it from my notes or not or if you went and got it on your own and if you do then what I'm going to read here might be just very slightly different I'm reading it from the new King James and I'm doing that for a reason awake awake put on your strength oh Zion is is that the new King James no it's not all right I'll read from my paper awake awake put on your strength oh Zion put on your beautiful garments oh Jerusalem the holy city for the uncircumcised and the unclean shall no longer come to you shake yourself from the dust Shake yourself from the dust arise and sit down arise and sit down does that sound a little strange get up and then sit down oh Jerusalem loose yourself from the bonds of your neck oh captive Daughter of Zion for thus says the Lord you have sold yourselves for nothing and ye shall be redeemed without money I'm going to read those three verses again oh awake awake put on your strength oh Zion put on your beautiful garments oh Jerusalem the holy city for the uncircumcised and the unclean shall no longer come to you shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down oh Jerusalem loose yourself from the bonds of your neck oh captive Daughter of Zion for thus says the Lord you have sold yourselves for nothing and ye shall be redeemed without money it doesn't say without price for truly this morning we have been redeemed with a great price it says without money how many of you know your your Redemption didn't come by money it came by something more precious and more valuable than Earth's money than Earth's gold or silver it came by the very created blood of God blood that was created specifically for the purpose of redemption bow your head just a moment father in the name of Jesus Christ it is our responsibility this morning to approach and to deliver your word I need you to come Lord for there's a message in this that must be heralded today I I can't do it without you lord for me to try and not depend on you would be H an e an exercise in futility I need you to come Lord and help me to get out of the way so that you can speak to your people anoint our ears to hear your word today may we everyone make a decision those who are streaming this service if time would permit I would mention names and countries for there are truly people tuned in with us this morning from around the world may every person under the sound of my voice make a decision today to arise and to awake to shake ourselves like never before and to loose ourselves from every bondage from every yoke that is upon our shoulder may we exercise uh uh in the in this service our faith that the anointing might come and not only break the Yoke but that every yoke would be destroyed we ask for your help today we are a needy people there are desperate needs represented in this house today come Lord Jesus is our prayer we ask for your help in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory alone and the saint said can you say it a little louder a little stronger you may be seated in Ghana you have to pray for for Benjamin and I because we we have quite a transition to make when you are with a people like that so hungry for for the things of God and so dedicated to worship it's not that we want you to be African we want you to be who God made you but please have a little compassion for us because we come from that atmosphere and we come back to the United States where where people take for granted what they have not just they're monetary but they're spiritual they take it for granted they take the anointing for granted they take freedom to worship for granted and so it's quite a transition to make and not only physically but also mentally and emotionally so we thank you for your prayers we are reading a very familiar portion of scripture today we are reading about the captive Daughter of Zion this is not a new message that that I'm bringing to you this morning this is something that God laid on my heart so heavily some years ago and I I I I couldn't begin to describe to you the night I had last night after I left here I I was just in in the night I was in travail and a and in turmoil because I knew there were some who had come to received their need met of the Lord and had left disappointed and when when you realize that then you carry it you know a little bit in intercession and if I told you the dreams that I had you would think I'm a crazy man I had an encounter with a giraffe last night in a dream you know and somebody said that couldn't have been spiritual but it was it really was spiritual a and then the illegitimate secret son of a pastor came and served me a meal and while he laid food on my table the Lord spoke to me who he was and and it was my responsibility to expose his identity no one would want that job would they and so one one one dream after another dream and an intercession in between and I think that's why the song meant so much to me today is because when you deal with something and you don't know how to pray and you just yield yourself and sometimes it comes out like a groan or a moan and people look at you like you're crazy they don't understand the intercessor life but I'm so thankful that God does I'm so thankful that he hears and answers prayer he not only moves according to the words that come out of our mouth but he sees the need of our heart when we can't articulate it when our vocabulary is insufficient and we don't feel like that we can express ourselves to the Lord aren't you glad that he the Holy Ghost comes and he cries out to God on our behalf and he gives us strength he gives us strength to keep pressing on we cannot survive on emotion it's going to take more than an emotion to get us through to the last of the last days we're going to have to be a noo people not a feel so not a h so not a think so we're going to have to be a no so people we're going to have have to know that we know that we know how strong and mighty our God is and we're going to have to trust him that he is able to do exceedingly abundantly above that which we could even ask or think if you believe that say amen amen turn the monitor down just a tad because it is a why don't you stay up there please and turn that down just a tad uh I've turned it all the way around but it's a little bit of an echo and I don't mean to be grumpy but we've come home to a brand new sound system it sounds like and so I I I want it to be I don't want to disturb anybody with the volume or with the echo uh I want to make it as as easy for you to hear as possible but I don't want to strain my throat either I want to want to do the best I can so what we were reading this morning is about Isaiah's Vision Isaiah was probably one of the greatest prophets of the Old Testament we don't like to compare the ministry of prophets we're not Catholic and we don't we don't necessarily believe in Major Prophets and Minor Prophets we understand that that is something that that the Catholic Church did and a and King James bought into that and so Isaiah and Jeremiah and Ezekiel are usually considered Major Prophets because their books are bigger and Hagi and Micah and Malachi are usually considered Minor Prophets because their books are smaller aren't you glad God is not judging you on the size of your book uh your calling is what matters but if we were to look at the ministry of Isaiah we would say that he has prophesied some of the most important and profound things concerning the the the life of of Israel the the life of the Jewish people he was not only a NABA prophet he he not only received uh uh uh words uh the the word nabba is a Hebrew word that that sort of means a gurgling forth and and so the spirit of the Lord would fall on Isaiah at times he would open his mouth and the word of the Lord would just kind of gurgle out un unrehearsed unplanned he he didn't know what he was going to say he just opened his mouth and God would speak isn't that a wonderful thing but he was also a Visionary Prophet I'm up here he W he's a Visionary Prophet a Seer Prophet which means he would sometimes see Visions there would be pictures that would form in the eye of his spirit and he would describe in prophetic utterance what he was seeing in the spirit and in Isaiah 52 he is describing to us a Visionary experience where he came upon the captive Daughter of Zion which is the nation and the spiritual Gathering Together of Israel we would call them the Jewish people but we understand that that Israel in the Old Testament is not just God dealing with his his Nation but it's also for example the New Testament tells us that everything that happened to Israel happened for a lesson to us as New Testament Believers we can look at the wonderings of the children of Israel and we can learn much in the New Covenant from what they experienced in the old Covenant if you understand that I'd like to hear you say amen am and so we are we are looking at what Isaiah saw concerning the condition of Israel but I want you to know it's a parallel because it's not only Israel that has Fallen Captive to her enemy but even the New Testament Church and even a portion of the elected predestinated bride of Jesus Christ Has Fallen Captive to to bondages to to traps to unbelief when we were in Pentecost everything was a sin I I grew up in in a Holiness environment and there were people unsure if you should consume caffeine and some preached you should women should wear head covering and some preached it was wrong for women to wear head covering and some would say a woman shouldn't wear a a pointed collar her collar should be round and others came and said no she shouldn't have a collar at all and some said a woman ought to ought to cinch her belt she should have a belt and pull her waist in and others would say no she should never wear a belt and then denim jumpers came out and some said that's ungodly because that reminds you of a man's coveralls and and I've told this story a thousand times but you need to relax so I'll tell it just one more time preacher came and preached for my granny and and he preached against coca colola and caffeine now mind you he would enjoy a big piece of chocolate cake which also has caffeine but he didn't want a a cocacola well my grandmother was driving 70 something miles every night and working during the day to have Revival down on Highway 10 in lore Alabama and this was the preacher she chose many times through the years I asked her is that the best you could do a preacher like that and she said I guess it was at the time so he had brought a fiery message message on the evils of drinking cocacola and and I wouldn't have cared if he' to preached that long as he didn't preach on Dr Pepper I would have been all right wouldn't have bothered me at all and he's just preaching away and she got so sleepy on the way home she said I thought I was going to go in the ditch and so she said I turned to the preacher and his wife in the back seat and I said I hope you won't be offended but she said I've got to stop here at the little store and and take a little refreshment and see if I can get something to drink that will wake me up and he said no no we understand she said now I know you you you preached on Coca colola tonight she said but I need a little something with a little caffeine or I'm going in the ditch and he said oh don't worry about it sister Shelly he said my wife and I will take a Double Cola well most of you don't even know what a Double Cola is but but a Double Cola was Double Cola it wasn't size but it was double caffeine so he wasn't against caffeine at all he was just against a brand if it' been Pepsi he would have drank it isn't it amazing how crazy come on I know people Shun from their church because they decided to change the color of their window shade isn't it amazing how crazy we can get how many of you are glad for the message of Grace how many of you are glad this isn't about our performance on a Geral wheel but this is about obedience to God and receiving Redemption through the blood of Jesus Christ we want to live a separated life but we don't ever want to trust in what we do or do not do to save us salvation is not of works it's Grace it's by grace that we are saved it is the gift of God none of us could be holy enough to be saved it's not your Holiness it's not my Holiness it's his Holiness that's going to preserve us it's his Holiness that's going to help us to get through do you believe that so Isaiah is experiencing a Visionary experience where he happens upon uh the captive Daughter of Zion it's one woman but she represents a nation of people and we know women represents the church the prophet has showed us that throughout the scripture here She lays she is bruised she's bloody she has been ravished I hope you will forgive me for the plainness of my language she has been raped Israel had been raped her enemy had forced himself on her just like preachers have raped the Bride of Jesus Christ by forcing their opinions on her instead of giving her the fullness of the word ripping out pieces of the message that they don't like anymore going back to Babylon back to Easter Bunny back to Easter basket back to Santa Claus back to the Christmas tree because preachers have ripped it out and they have left her in confusion but don't you worry about her her Deliverance is in her own mouth Hallelujah for the word of God is nigh under her even in her mouth she's not waiting on a preacher to bring her her Deliverance she recognizes sh she recognizes that the word is already in her and she has a responsibility to awaken herself to shake herself out of the Dust to recognize that her Word of Deliverance has already come she doesn't need a preacher to have a vision about her she needs to rise up to awake out of her sleep to put on her strength to tear off her bloody muddy Rip Torn soil garment and be dressed in the Royal Robes of his righteousness she chooses to take off those clothes that are carrying the residual of Babylon you see Babylon has Stained the garments of the church Babylon three Gods improper baptism tongues as an Evidence come on Amen even doctrines that have come along and said things like a woman can cut her hair as long as she wears a head covering you ought to know better than that you ought to know better than that that Prophet cried out under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost keep the scissors out of your hair because once you start using those things it is a slippery slope that's right and so they put it in a little twirl and cover it up because they don't want people sometime to know what they've been doing preachers have come along instead of preaching righteousness they've told women well you can cut the front because you don't know what to do with it and you can do this you can do that in the other but you know the little bride isn't looking for an easier way this this Daughter of Zion she's not looking for an easier way she's looking for God's way it's too late I want somebody to hear what I'm saying to you it's too late to compromise now we're too near the end oh hallelujah our final Redemption is in sight who wants to slack up now this little bride doesn't want to slack up she wants to run on she wants to climb she realizes that God has been mighty good to her but she wants more she's still crying out more Lord more Lord more Lord Isaiah's broken his heart is crushed he sees this beautiful prince prin of Zion he sees her and he remembers her former Beauty he remembers how radiant she used to be stay with me he remembers how radiant she used to be how graceful she used to carry herself her hair glistened in the Sun and her clothes spoke of royalty a and uh her strength was to be admired you read The Song of Solomon and you hear the description of this beautiful woman and you you realize that somehow God is using the inspiration of Solomon to describe the beauty of his own wife the wife of the Lord the Bride of the Lord we're living in an hour now where there's a transition that must take place between bride and wife the Bible said that her his wife hath made herself ready and uh that woman is not his wife until she has entered into intimate relationship with him and the same way you you God has no grandchildren you can't be born into the message you're not ready for Rapture because daddy believed the message or or Mama believe the me there's no second generation or third generation pass but every individual must have their own experience with God and they must receive their own revelation of this truth when you get a revelation of this message it doesn't matter to you how many articles are written against it it doesn't matter to you how many family members Fall by the wayside it doesn't matter how many people leave the church for greener pastors once you've got a revelation of this truth you realize that it'll take you all the way because it's not the revelation of the voice of God Jeffersonville it's not the revelation of William brandham that's not going to make it folks it's only the revelation of Jesus Christ him in plain view he's no longer hiding behind the lattice but he has stepped out from behind the lattice and the bride is beholding his face Isaiah he remembers how this captive Daughter of Zion once carried herself he remembers her beauty now lost her dress is torn her face is smeared she carries shame she's she's blushed with shame she's laying there a victim she's wallowing in her victimhood she's had many opportunities to get up that's right somebody said what about that band around her neck we'll get there she's had many opportunities to save herself she's had many opportunities to awake and to arise Out of the Dust to shake herself and do what the what verse two says loose loose yourself I want to say again loose Yourself Loose yourself it didn't say run to the preacher and he'll loose you come on now wait for the Evangelist and he'll loose you wait till your pastor comes to pray for you and he'll loose you but the word of the Lord through Isaiah to the captive Daughter of Zion was you first got to get up out of your victimhood you got to come out of that wo it's me and I'm not loved like everybody else I'm not treasured like everybody else if you're waiting on someone to respect you there's two things you need to know number one you need to be respectable if if you want to be honored you need to be honorable and a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways a man who's on fire one service and dead the next is not to be honored or respected he's to be challenged that's a double-minded man we've got to have the victory whether we feel it or not come on we've got to get get up out of victimhood it's a spirit I want you to know that not only is the spirit of Leo deia the age of people's rights it's also the age of the mentality of everybody is a victim let me tell you something you make up your mind I'm not going to be a victim anymore I'm a Victor I'm not a vict him I'm a Victor why because Jesus [Applause] Jesus Is the Victor come on now you look around at somebody else going through something you see how they praise you see how they don't let their problems affect their praise that's somebody to be honored somebody that comes in here with a praise when everything's going you know you can tell you can tell the look on people's face when they want attention and I got a little bit of a problem with that I've got a little problem when people feel sorry for theel and want to be noticed there's something in me that opposes that victimhood and I want to ignore that person you pray for me I'm I'm telling you the honest truth you pray for me because that may not be the right response but I know what else is not the right response petting somebody's feel sorry for me spirit that won't work either there comes a time that we've got to awake awake put on your strength oh Zion put on your beautiful garments Shake yourself from the dust arise and then sit down that sit down doesn't mean on your honey bone that means in your position do You Hear What brother brandom said when that bride realizes who she is do you understand that when you realize who you are who you belong to and what that makes you in the economy of God you won't want anybody to feel sorry for you anymore you'll want to point instead of pointing everybody to your problem you'll want to point everybody to your solution what if if I put an SOS out every time I had a problem what if I called on you to pray for me every time I face something in the course of seven days what if you did the same to me while we would be so encumbered with everybody's problems and burdens that we would never be able to hear anything from the Lord we'd come and not be fed sometime we have to make up our mind to pull up our boot straps I knew when I woke up this morning it wasn't going to be easy for some of us I knew this was going to be a little hard message I can't help it sometime we have to reach down and pull up our bootstraps and put our big boy you know uh it's time to get rid of our granimal do you does anybody remember granimal sirar and robu used to have something called granimal a't that what it was called sister Ronda do you remember cuz you was a mother so you probably bought some for your boys I had some too somebody said what is that little Underpants and a little t-shirt to match they had a little tag on it and it was animals animal lions tigers and bears and then what was that what was the superhero version there was a superhero version of underwear and little t-shirts for boys that come out what was that called oh come on folks what in the world was that called I huh underuse thank you sister Kathy if if I had a prize I'd give it to you unus there comes a time that we graduate yes from our under I know some of you from a plane from a plain Heritage you you think I'm the vulgar go here I am talking about underwear in the house of God you you got to grow up sometime and trade your Gan animals for something a little more mature in this kingdom of God you can't lay there until somebody encourages you you've got to rise up sometime and pray in the Holy Ghost to build yourself up in the spirit that's what the word said praying in the spirit building yourself up in the Holy Ghost but but you just don't understand everything I touch is falling apart I just sit around and watch it crumble you you know like Zach and Liz this could be their song every time I turn around it's mold mold in the floorboard mold on the wall possums in the closet that's the if that's the only song they sung if that's all they ever talked about what about the victory what about goodness of God I'm not making Li my heart goes out to somebody who repairs one thing and another thing needs to be repaired but it's really it's like welcome to ownership it's like welcome to no more granimal for you Zach oh I could tell you Zach and my boys used to run around the house in their underwear at my house been to with a towel on his neck wanting to be Superman oh if life could could be so innocent if troubles could be so few but God knows what he's doing he don't put those kind of problems on you when you're four he waits until you grow up and you're mature and when the enemy comes in like a flood don't you forget that you've got a God you've got a papa you've got an everlasting father who wants to carry you when you can't carry yourself sometimes you can't wait on a word of encouragement you've got to touch God you've got to play a tape you've got to go to the app you've got to read a sermon book somebody said I I my wife I needed encouragement and my wife wasn't there to encourage me oh why why why brother what you going to do get mad and not eat my lunch today I don't care how mad you get you're still going to want a picnic aren't you that's just how we are come on I'm not trying to offend you I'm trying to tell you that we have everything we need to keep pressing on I want you to look at your neighbor and say Jesus is your Victor tell them Jesus is your Victor if you had to get yourself out of the mass alone we we wouldn't have much hope but he's waiting on you to call on him he's waiting on you to roll the burden over on him he's waiting on you to let him do the worrying I'm not going to worry Why Should I Worry why should I fear when the very same Jesus here the captive Daughter of Zion I got to hurry she was only a a torn and tattered girl laying there revealed here in Isaiah sad and pitiful vision is what Israel had become keep in mind that Zion is more than ancient Israel it is also the redeemed of the Lord in this Midnight Hour Zion Is Us the captive Daughter of Zion could easily be us even under this message of Grace we are a Zion people I want you to listen again to this horrible description of the state of God's people in Isaiah's Vision the daughter of Zion a once pure and beautiful woman who gave birth to many sons of Israel now She lays like a slave in the dust she's been abused she's been molested she's been defiled by the uncircumcised by the unclean by the enemies of the god of Israel her garments are torn and filthy and she was [Applause] [Music] howling she wasn't whimpering she wasn't quietly weeping she was howling in her distress is anybody listening to me her despair had moved her to the point and she was howling like a sickened animal caught in a trap and Isaiah the prophet of God sees her he hears her hows he sees her Despair and oh how he longs to comfort her as a representative of God a prophet he wants to draw her up on to his arm he wants to lay her head on his shoulder and tell her I'm here stay with me tell her that everything is going to be all right he wants to brush off the dirt he wants to sooth their wounds that fatherly nature might even want to kiss her elbow I don't know you've got to remember there's no there's no lust here there's there's nothing unclean here this is a prophet God's God's representative on the earth and he sees the condition of God's people he might just have a gut-wrenching desire to kiss her wounds to anoint her to lift her up he's full of compassion for her he has pity on her condition it most is it would make one think that he would say oh precious daughter beautiful daughter of Zion don't worry anymore your answer is here I'm here to help you but he doesn't say any of that perhaps that's what his flesh would like to cry out on her behalf but instead he opens his mouth and the kna word of the Lord begins to flow out instead of saying I see you in your condition my heart is breaking for your pain my anger is stirred toward those who have left you here in this broken and bruised condition but as that word of the Lord begins to roll off of his lips none of that comes out it doesn't sound like pity it doesn't even sound like compassion the word of the Lord doesn't always soothe the emotion amen it doesn't always soothe oh God help me strengthen me it doesn't always soothe the emotion but the word of the Lord it may not sound like what we want it it may not sound like what we want but it's always what we need the word of the Lord the word of the Lord if I were you and I couldn't handle it I would find me a church with a pastor you understand what I'm saying I would find me a church with a Shepherd one who has no prophetic unction in his life and there are many like that if you need us to recommend a place we can even recommend places for you there are many pastors out there who have no prophetic unction and no prophetic call they don't need it they've been given a Shepherd's Heart they're pastoring out of a Shepherd's Heart of compassion and they're good to the sheep and they always know just the right words to say but if you choose if God should lead you and you make a choice to choose a pastor with a prophetic voice with some kind of little tiny little gifting or something like that in his life you must understand that the word of the Lord in his mouth will not always sound like what we need to hear but if it's truly God speaking if he's really been before the Lord if he's really heard the Lord's voice it may not sound like what she needs but it will always be exactly what God would have her to hear and this is what come out of Isaiah's mouth get [Applause] up he didn't mention the blood in her hair on now he didn't mention what looked like a broken arm he didn't mention the ruination of her beautiful dress yes he just said awake girl awake oh captive Daughter of Zion shake off the dust sir oh I'd like to speak to some of you here this morning who are drawing away from the Lord instead of drawing away toward the lord and you're wondering why things are going the way they're going in your life you think you can be good to somebody and kind to somebody and that's all it takes let me tell you something except a man be born again except a woman be born again she cannot inherit the kingdom of God it's not enough to be kind to the neighbor it's not enough to sit through long Services you've got to be born again you've got to have your own experience with the Lord come on now no grandchildren in this thing it's you in Jesus and instead of giving her these wonderful sweet precious kind compassionate words he looks to her and he says don't you realize that I'm about to do something in Jerusalem and I'm about to drive the unclean and the uncircumcised right out of her City you've got to shake yourself you've got to get yourself up you've got to get the dust off of you I can't clean you but you can clean yourself come on he said loose yourself from the bonds of your neck you don't wait on me to bring the key how could he say something so cruel and incompassion and because he knew that she wasn't really locked up at all she was still wearing a band on her neck that had been unlocked a long time ago she was being held To The Ground by an imaginary chain she was like the 12-ft shuffle she was like the bear that had marched that 12T forward and 12T backward and 12T forward and 12T backward that finally when he was even pushed out of the cage and there were no boundaries and there were no confinements he had he had so formed such a a habit and a comfort zone that even without out the cage he just continued 12T forward 12T backward I could lay my hands on people that have been in this church for years and you may have gotten excited a time or two and you may have run the aisle a time or two but the reality is you're still on a 12-ft shuffle we don't know from Sunday to Sunday whether you're going to be up or down we don't know from Sunday to Sunday whether you're going to have the victory or whether you're going to have already laid back down in the Meer in the mud in the cess poool that God had lifted you from come on now if you think I'm angry with you you're so wrong you you're so very very wrong but I'm hearing in my spirit that if you're going to climb a mountain you're going to have to make some decisions do you want to be pied or do you want to be prodded do you want to be pulled gently or do you want somebody who loves you to kick you in the the seed of the pants and tell you that you can have the victory if you want it you can't pray twice a week and have the victory you can't pray three times a week and have the victory you can hear the word twice a week and walk in the victory that's right this it is the truth this is an everyday experience when the when the somebody said oh I've got Plumbing trouble let me tell you about Plumbing trouble I've had my safety tank pumped four times in the last 60 days at $350 to $400 a pop I got Plumbing troubles I just don't send an SOS out every time I've got a plumbing problem I just do what a what a man has to do I just call the pump truck I just trust that God will make a way to pay the bill my wife said honey they've gone up $50 I said I can't help it thank you darling I can't help it if they go up $150 a man's got to do what a man's got to do sometime we just have to face it head on that's right and know that you your faith you don't need my faith every time you get in B that's your faith you better hear him you better hear him you get a little whim in your mind and you think you've known the word you think you've got the word of the Lord and you run like a wild man in a direction find yourself flat on your face where if You' have just called on a voice of wisdom or you would have just submitted yourself to Godly leadership brother yes sir cuz there's a body here there's a body here it's time folks it's time it's time it's time the nations are calling for what you [Music] have it's time it's time for us to make up our minds that we're not going to live another six months in the same condition that we have had the past 6 months but we're going to awake out of our sleep we're going to shake ourselves we're going to you don't have it any worse than anybody else well that's a hard lesson to learn it is such a hard lesson to learn you come to a place where your trials can make you bitter it's your choice or they can make you better you can say I choose to praise him in my storm one night we we started home from the service in Ghana I've been going to Africa for for to Ghana for 30 years I don't I don't even know how many times I've been there I don't ever remember seeing rain in Ghana and all the times that I've gone but we we're in the vehicle on the way home from the meeting and four or five little drops sister Sandy brother day four or five little drops fall on the windshield and it's so dusty everything's so dusty there the church is Dusty they don't have glass to hold the dust out there are many many openings in the wall for circum uh for for circulation in the building and so the dust just comes in and they have to dust and they have to cover all the equipment my folks it's so easy for us to come to church and not even pick up a piece of trash I don't know how long trash will lay out there at the end of the building and I know what some folk Lord already showed me what some folks are waiting on they're waiting on Benjamin to pick it up well it's his job isn't it absolutely no more his job than yours boy it's getting personal in here isn't it it's no more his job than your job when we hired him when I hired him to work for me I didn't hire him to pick up somebody else's trash he ought to have a heart to do it he ought to have a servant's heart but so should you water Bott all over the property and people walk right around leave your kids things all over the property with no respect waiting on somebody else come on folks go out of here and leave your snotty kleenexes for somebody else to pick up don't you have a trash can boy it's getting rough don't you have a trash can at your house right brother are you waiting to be served are are you asking the Lord to give you a servant's heart these poor people have to come in and sit in in in in in disposable chairs dust their own seats they have to cover everything up here comes these few little drops of rain I said to him I I don't know if I've ever seen rain well it'd be nice if it would be enough rain to wash the dust off I didn't know it was going to flood the lobby of the hotel I didn't know the water was going to come running across the floor in my in my room because the wind was going to blow the rain I didn't know a monsoon was about to break out here come a little little maid in there and oh I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I said did you make it rain she said no sir I said then why are you sorry it's not your fault you didn't do it she said well I'm going to put you another room I said no ma'am you're not I'm not going anywhere I'll sleep in here with a flooded floor before I go in a room with no air conditioning I said I'm barefooted anyway won't hurt me I'll just Sosh around I'm not going nowhere she thought that was the funniest thing she'd ever heard I said in fact what I'm going to do as soon as you get out here I'm going to pray the rain's going to stop and everything's going to be all right talk about looking at me she she took a double check well who that man think he is I said yeah soon as you get out we're going to pray God's going to shop the rain here she come in a few minutes I mean just a few minutes the rain stopped the the lobby started draining the floor I I said to the I said to the to to Benjamin Hulk I said the floor is dry not only did God stop the rain he dried up the floor we saw it with our own eyes she come down the hall she put her head in the room she said you meant it didn't you you me you were going to pray and God was going to do it she said thank you that's who we [Applause] are I think Benjamin sent a video to Jenna he wanted Jenna to feel sorry for him and I think he sent a video to her down in Louisiana Camp show to the floor flood it I didn't send out no video to tell somebody how roughly life was on the mission field I just said now Lord You've washed off the dust youve fed the crops now I need you to stop the rain and you know what it don't take a great big faith it just takes faith in a great big God that spoken word in your mouth mouth is more powerful than you realize your mouth is more powerful than you realize and do you know what's the problem with that there's a downside to having so much power in your tongue there's a downside because one way or the other you're creating the world that you're living in you're creating the atmosphere that you live in one way or the other with your words if you're the victim that's all that comes out of your mouth you're creating a bubble of pity I wish I was a preacher I'd preach thank you Mama Flo he didn't tell her how much he felt sorry for her he said get up from there woman you're going to you you you're who you are you're who you always were you're a little worse for the wear but you had it hadn't changed who you are you're still the daughter of Zion you may been taken advantage of the enemy may have taken advantage of you he may blooded you he may have Gob smacked you a time or two but you're who you always were from the moment you gave your heart to the Lord by the birth of his Spirit you became a Son of God remember brother bam tells us that Adam's Fellowship changed but his relationship didn't change he's now a sinner but he's still a son he is still a son that little bit of pride it's crept in on some of you this morning because you think you're being preached at you ought to get rid of that now you ought to get rid of that now cuz you're going to shut the very thing that God is sending to help you out of your confusion you're going to shut that down if you don't watch it he stepped on my toes he hurt my feelings let me tell you something I want to ask you what brother I want to tell you what brother BR said what's feelings got to do with anything are you waiting on somebody to massage your ego and tell you how amazing and how wonderful you are are you waiting on somebody to help you up you need a help up I can't pull you up you've got to get up yourself but I can put my arm out there if you want to grab a hold of it brother gy can't make you want to get up but he can put his arm out there and if you want to take a hold of that arm he'll be glad to help you every man of God every prayer Warrior woman in this house is willing to help you but we can't give you the want to we can't make you miserable with where you are to the point you do something about it only you can make up your mind that's right oh hear the word of the Lord hear the word of the Lord her garments were torn and filthy she was howling in despair she was clutching the chain that choked her neck and she pleaded for three things if you go on and read the rest of that chapter actually actually several chapters she pleaded for three things number one to be set free quickly is there anybody in here that wants to be set free quickly I I didn't see your hand quickly you don't want one more night with the [Music] frogs when the baby comes I'm GNA do such and such when I get my new job I'm going to do such and such when I get that last nagging bill paid anybody with me you with me I know your name not everybody's but I can call the ones I know are you with me well when when such and such you know when when the when the ship comes in what ship one time I saw my ship but it was going in the other direction one time I was at my lowest place and somebody looked at me with a heart of compassion and said cheer up brother Shelly there's a light at the end of the tunnel I said you're right it's a locomotive you're right there is a light at the end of the tunnel and it is a train that's about to smoosh me why are you looking at me like I'm mean it was my own despair come on see it's not that that you need sir you don't need me to tell you there's a light at the end of the tunnel you got the same owner man ual that I got come on now you got the same Bible I got you don't need me to tell you what tap to listen to you got the same Holy Spirit I've got let the spirit of God lead you to a tape yes sir that's right eat your way out of your trials I challenge you I challenge you Saints in Jesus name eat your way out of your problem not donuts and eclaires and Shoe Fly pies there's a few of us that have tried to do it that way we know what emotional eating is you get tired and you tell yourself well I deserve a second piece of cake come on but just be like Jaden Jackson everybody's bragging on my wife's chocolate cake last night is gone in just a few minutes gone and and Heather didn't get a piece and if anybody knows Heather they know she needs some sugar and Mariah had a part of a piece and I said Heather didn't get any Ryan said oh she can have mine she gave the half piece and Jaden come by and he put his finger in that chocolate cake and he he tasted he said don't eat that that's trash you you find out in a hurry that what's delicious and amazing to somebody doesn't satisfy don't fear sorry for my wife she laughed she thought was funny I'm sitting after service in Ghana eating fried rice that's got cabbage and carrots and beans in it Benjamin has already consumed his rice and chicken if if a speck of green was in it he'd have a spell and and I'm thinking I can't eat the rest of mine too bad I can't share it with him I thought the cabbage in it was was amazing it gave it the crunch it needed it was delicious I wanted to share my amazing chicken fried rice and he can just turn his nose up say ass trash I can't eat that well you know what my response is you're not very hungry you can make a decision to eat your way out I I I I'll give it to the vog I'll give it to him once I'll use their slogan one time why don't you just press play and Obey this word will lift you it will sustain you and if you're not hungry for the word there is the root of your condition it is nothing but the truth she said I want to be set free quickly I got to hurry she said I want to be set free quickly I do not want to die in slavery and I don't want to be cut off from spiritual food that's three things we ought to cry out today I want to be set free quickly I do not want to die in slavery and I do not want to be cut off from my spiritual food anybody with me good we'll we might make it off of page one her enemies were not standing so very far do I have a few more minutes thank you her enemies were not standing so very far from her mocking blaspheming taunting her that her God had lost his power to set her free from slavery it sounds like certain aspects certain clicks around this message where they tell you you've got to live with your with your weakness you've got to live with your addiction you you know you just keep coming back and hoping that one day it's going to get better I have no confidence in that kind of a message that's not the same one I heard in 1988 it's a different message the one the one I hear says this word will give you everything you need there's not a better nerve pill anywhere on planet Earth than that word there's not a better anti-depressant anywhere in this world than feasting on that word there's not a chemotherapy that's better for what ailed you than that word right there that word of God that's been delivered in our day the revelation of Jesus Christ will feed you but why should we why should we why should we eat we're going to come to church at least two times a week that's for those of you who make it both times and we're going to be spoonfed either brother gley or brother Shelly they're going to hand you a spoon and put it in your mouth and you're not going to have to find it you're not going to have to pray for it you're not going to have to fast to get it you're not going to have to dig for it you're not going to have to hear a tape you're not going to have to search a scripture I don't need your amen right now all you're going to do is come in here and open your mouth and that depends on your moood [Applause] [Music] and your enemy is looking at you yeah God's lost his power hadn't he Your Enthusiasm is draining Now isn't it you've been here a couple years and it's not as precious to you as it was when you first came come on he's mocking he's mocking I thought you left everything you had behind to come and find a better mocking mocking mocking mocking that's what he does he mocks he taunts the Bible tells us that two terrible things had come upon her in in Isaiah 51:19 it said no one was sorry for her no one showed her any compassion no one showed her any sympathy are you with me and number two no one would comfort her and so guess what she did she just made up her mind I'll just stay where I am nobody has compassion for me nobody feels sorry for me and there's nobody to comfort me so I will bite off my nose and spite my face I'll show them I'll just show them I'll lay right here and moan I'll let let a fresh move of are you hearing me I'll let a fresh move of the spirit of God let me tell you something right now I can predict to you the ones that will shake my hand today and the ones that will say to me Pastor thank you for delivering an uncomfortable word and I can lay my hands on those of you that won't look at me the rest of the afternoon and neither reaction is going to change anything I have learned I need your amens to get through a sermon don't don't misunderstand me but I have learned to live without your validation and without your fellowship a pastor who can't learn to survive without validation and without Fellowship is going to be a failure the suicide rate among pastors is higher in 2023 than it has ever been in the history of the world of keeping records of suicidal pastors I want you to know just in case you're wondering I'm not one of those right now who's struggling with suicide but I'll tell you what I will do if I ever get to that place I'll do what I did as an 11year old boy I'll throw myself down at the foot of my bed and I will call on The God Who came to me as a child who delivered me from from a spirit of lust that would have taken me off track you would have read about my life you would have seen me on TV you would have known my my sin it would have surely been exposed had God not come and rescued me I didn't even know what to ask for I didn't even know what was wrong with me I just knew that something was trying to take a hold of my life and I saw saw my great-grandfather I saw my grandfather I saw my father and I knew that whatever had destroyed their lives and marriages was determined to destroy mine that's right so I threw myself and that's what I would do so you can rest assure that I will do that again I'll probably send a text on my way down to brother gy and say pray for me I'm tired and I'm I'm I'm I'm having a temptation to check out and I'd like for you to pray for me but I certainly will not sit there and wait on his prayers to get through how dare you ask me to pray for you when you won't pray for yourself true that's right how mad do you think I am not at all when you won't pray for yourself on when you won't Shake Yourself pray brother shell that God will shake me no no on if we loosed God to shake us he might not stop but if we learn to shake ourselves [Music] let's talk about it let's sit down for a few hours and see if you can solve the problems that I have created in 15 years of marriage I got the answer I can't I don't have any wisdom I I don't have any ability to untangle our mess I can't untangle my own messes all I can do is If he if he helps me I'll try to help you but if he doesn't guess what folks you're on your own I know it's quiet you can't keep making messes and start looking for somebody else in your family family who can untangle them I'll tell you one more time don't quit having children that you're going to ship off to somebody else to raise boy that's tough ain't it if you're going to bring them here to this world you raise them and you raise them right in the fear of God and don't get your little feelings hurt when you can't find a babysitter every time you need one and let me just go ahead while I'm on the subject and say to you daddies when you are caring for your children you are not babysitting it's called parenting hello I don't know what was in that lasagna I ate last night it wasn't the lasagna that did it it was giraffe and and and illegitimate Pastor children serving me food in my dreams I knew every time I woke up I knew that there was much to intercede about page two she goes on to say Isaiah goes on to say her own Sons her sons you see the captive Daughter of Zion is a mother she gave birth to many sons the Bible tells us in 51:18 Isaiah 5118 I think you have it Austin that her own Sons had fainted and lay like a wild bull in a net she was absolutely alone there was no one to come to her rescue there is none to guide her among all the sons whom she had brought forth neither is there any that taketh her by the hand of all the sons that she has brought up her own children have moved on to their success and forgot Mama and there she lay she didn't need someone to give her a bottle to suck will I offend you if I tell you she didn't e a sugar tit that's right she didn't need it for some of you City Slickers that don't know what a sugar tent is it's just a cloth you just put a little sugar in it sometime better than parar full grown cre Christians don't need a sugar tent I can't believe I'm saying that so so so boldly you don't need a binky that's right or a blinky or a py let's see how many different names we can get call them out what' y'all call them what' your children call them help me suus oh my goodness suus little French in here what else pass oh somebody called it by their eye wait a minute uh let me tell you about Josiah and Jennifer they're fixing to have number one Benjamin and Jen are fixing to have number one let me tell you how number one goes the pacifier drops on the ground and Mom and Daddy both go where's the Pot where's the ball and water then number two comes along look let's just be honest before number one is off his py because Benjamin he had had his while I know you knowing him find that very hard to believe but he kept his a while we we cut the end off of it and he still tried to make it work there wasn't even enough to get his teacher in you know finally finally you you pick it up off the dirty floor and you just lick it off and pop it right in the mouth mature Christians don't need sugar tents they don't need paes or blinkies or Seuss or whatever else you need mature meat the word of the hour the revelation of Jesus Christ oh I wish I had a pastor who would tell me about current events I wish I had a pastor who would preach to me where I'm living come on get up get up out of the dirt there's no anger in me when I say that in fact my heart breaks when I think about the times I wasted laying in my victimhood when the word of the Lord was n me sir already in my mouth but I needed everybody worried about me I needed everybody moving around scurrying around you know there's certain members of the family that have a little problem and everybody just goes I mean absolutely crazy and the other son can have a problem and nobody even moves one daughter she she sends out a a call and everybody's cousin's husband's wife's cousins show up to help C people are still handling one another like children we parents are probably the most guilty still handling them like children when sometimes we need to bite our lip and turn our head I made up my mind that I wasn't going to run myself crazy for for for every little infraction that I saw in my children sometimes they wear things I wish they didn't wear sometime they put on something a little different than what I would what I wish but what I have learned is Daddy can do a whole lot more on his knees and I go there I go there I say when I know I'm supposed to say something I'm going to say something you don't have to worry but there are times I just have to get down and say holy ghost get them and don't let them go until they see that there is nothing in the Shimmer shammer and the glitter glamour of this old world that means anything when you're in a fight for survival it don't matter in her hands there had been a cup of trembling oh me I've got to stop I'm wor out she lay in her disgrace trampled in the Dust by the enemy I had 15 pages I was going to read I wouldn't going to preach I was just going to read laying in disgrace an enemy who walk walked over her the one who had borne the vessels of the Lord was now polluted and unclean and laying in her pitiful slavery her unsatisfied hunger her helpless condition she had fallen into a stuper her sensitivities and sensibilities were gone something had gripped her soul she was drunk but not with wine Isaiah 51:21 she was so mentally confused so emotionally wrecked that she could only lie in the dust stunned and defenseless useless unless something would happen soon she would surely fall into a coma and die there on the hill like an animal in Chains the tragedy are you with me the tragedy of of it all is that this poor enslaved Daughter of Zion had sold herself ain't that what the scripture said she had sold herself into slavery and got no joy in the ransom no one was holding her as a slave she sold herself at her own will she chose slavery instead of of Freedom did you know there are times that slavery is more comfortable than having to adult the tragedy no satanic slave traitor had captured her and carried her away against her will she had not been overcome by some ungrate unseen power she had sold herself into slavery guess what the price was nothing Isaiah 52:3 you have sold yourself for not the captive Daughter of Zion today is not just Israel not just the Jewish people it's any and all who number themselves among the redeemed yet choose to live in sin that's right those who remained in any form of unbelief could be likened to the captive Daughter of Zion this pitiful creature is the believer who is chained to a secret sin it's the one who brings reproach on God's house by living a double life or the one who refuses to deal with the Yoke that's upon his or her shoulder because they want someone to hand them their freedom hand them their Deliverance right I can tell when I go to pray for somebody whether they're going to what they need or not and it doesn't depend on my faith and it doesn't depend on my prayer it depends on whether they're ready to receive the reality sometimes is are they ready to adult are they ready to take responsibility are they going to let their condition keep them in the bed or are they going to crawl out on all fours and say I refuse to die like this I've got herbs to harvest josana I've got things I need to do I've got things that need to be done and nobody's going to do them but me hello hello hello hello hello hello hello it's anyone who takes a break from his sin to cover the altar with tears but has no intention of getting rid of the pet it's the man or woman who's won many souls to Christ whose spiritual life is being drained by lust it's all who are chained by an unforsaken sin or an unattended hindrance or distraction faed down in the dust of Despair ring with guilt and walked upon by the enemy who gets them to indulge at his will and whim there can be no True Deliverance from The Binding chain of sin until we see ourselves as a Daughter of Zion in the dust chained trampled on slowly sinking into a spiritual stuper while we argue between ourselves in our house who is more spiritual the husband or the wife well I'm more spiritual than you no I'm more spiritual than you well God gave me that well no well well God didn't give it to me well does it really matter you bloody husband oh now he's gone to cussing like an Australian I was only quoting what Zapora said you've been a bloody husband to me you're the one that got lazy and sorry and would no longer circumcise the sons you bear the responsibility of Israel and her disgrace because you quit taking the knife and cutting off the foreskin you alone Moses are responsible for the weakened condition of the people of God because you wouldn't tell them the truth I may be guilty of hurting your feelings but I will not be guilty of not telling you the truth brother we must look at this vision of Isaiah and cry out oh God I've laid here long enough brother sister isn't it time to take an honest look at that one ruling passion that one sin that still enslaves us that one sin we keep going back to time after [Music] time I want to ask some of you this question if you were to compare the pleasure of your sin to the pain that it causes would it be worth the effort most of us can testify that the pleasures of of unbelief the pleasures of sin and the attributes of unbelief are so fleeting and so temporary and sometime the pleasure hasn't ended when the guilt has already come pouring in and as an army of God we need to raise up and say it's not worth it it's just not worth it anymore it's just not worth it anymore to be tormented by my own self it's just not worth it anymore it's not worth it anymore to wait on someone to feel sorry for me it's just not worth it anymore to wait on somebody to come by and comfort me and then I'll try to get up it's just not worth it anymore to wait for a raise on my job and then I'll get everything straightened out on or if I can just own my own business or if I can just do this or I can just do it then I'll get where I need to be with God if I can get all the mold scrubbed I can't preach to them no more they're not here if I can just get all the mold scrubbed out it' be something else you get the the mold out in the mouse poop will be there come on I'm really getting raw now brother it's just life but you and I have got to find the victory we've got to learn to dance in the rain we've got to learn to give God praise in grief in loss we've got to learn like David the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord my dog died cry today Rejoice tomorrow go find you another dog granny Terell took her to the zoo Sister Williams granny Terrell took her to the zoo remember she's so determined to show us that she don't need our help getting out of the van that she jumps out nearly 90 she jumps out and her little wedged heel of her shoe H who wears church shoes to the zoo 9 year olds Master purse too she's in heaven the little wedged heel hit the edge of the stool and down on her bottom she went on the asphalt if only she would have had a p P who would have said come on granny God love you get up let's make sure nothing is broke but I saw all those school kids all they wanted to do was see a elephant I didn't tell her she couldn't come but I'm wondering why do you want to hold the little kids back I'm being [Music] honest stay home and watch National Geographic let the kids go to the zoo on no you want to know the reality I was going because I was going she wanted to be as close to me as she could be God Rest her soul I wanted to weep with her I wanted to be compassionate I wanted to feel sorry for her I knew it could be a help but I saw all those little children all they wanted to do was go see the elephants and I made a split-second decision that I don't regret I took her by the arm and we snatched her up so fast that she didn't even know she fell and on the way up I said get up from there there's no time for you to lay around we got elephants to say come on Hallelujah there's giraffes at this zoo we don't have have time to sit around on the job oh she got up a little stiff and she checked everything next thing you know she had her purse stuck and here she goes what if she'd have had a pastor instead of this impostor she'd have been in an ambulance she'd have been on her way to X she didn't need an x-ray she needed somebody to tell her it ain't as bad as it [Applause] looks she needed a mama like I had walk it off walk it off what's your problem sometimes what we think we need it's not really what we need but I know a God who knows what I need when I don't even know what it is here this poor woman I'm closing musicians are tiptoeing to the platform that means not drawing attention to themselves but just delicately making their way to the platform no selfies on the way no Benjamin with a camera going right in the middle of my mission report loose thyself show me the verse show me the verse shape thyself from the Dust I I know what I know what depression is like I thought if I got married I'd never be depressed again wrong there's nothing like a good wife to depress you I had panic attacks anxiety my doctor my medical doctor said' I don't think I'd marry right now you're you're really in a tether and I thought I thought in my mind perhaps and you probably thought the same a change of scenery change of responsibility willix no it just comes back I thought when Benjamin came I'd never deal with depression again I thought here come a second son and two beautiful daughters life is good and the bills are finally paid and but that's not how depression works sometimes it's chemical sometimes it's [Music] environmental sometimes it's demonic everything can be going good in your life and you just feel so heavy every bill paid and everything in order and you can become so anxious that you feel like your chest is squeezing and you need a doctor you can go from one house repair to the next and you can uh even put the pump truck on speed dial and there'll be something else you get rid of that nagging person on your job Lord if I can just get rid of that woman life will be so good and here comes you know one right out of hell makes it so much worse I I know people who thought uh wife number one nearly killed me so I'll I'll find me another one and and number two was worse you see the enemy is always going to find something and because it's little to me doesn't mean it's little to you or it's big to me doesn't mean it's going to be big to you we're all made differently all wondrously made in the image of God and we're all aect Ed different by the things around us but here's the part that you must come to a place that you can accept you're no longer helpless or hopeless you are a son of God I want you to say and you better do it I'm not in the mood for people who don't participate in class I am an overcomer I am an overcomer come on I am you say it I am I am an overcomer I am an overcomer by the blood of the Lamb by the blood by the word of

not but he can turn it around in the next 30 seconds there's someone sitting here this morning that was worried and concerned in the natural about about things and how things would feel and how things would be and whether it would be awkward or whether whether it' be miserable whether it' be pleasant or how things would be but let me tell you something we underestimate the power that's right of the God we serve he looked down and he said no I don't want it to be awkward no I don't want it to be miserable no I don't want it to be like that I want you to experience something else so you find yourself worrying about something that doesn't even happen because your Papa loves you because your God cares about you you silly boy don't you know you can take a pay cut if you have to take a pay cut to be in God's will don't you know your God is bigger than your problem he's bigger than your grief bigger than your sickness well I'm afraid I'm going to die news flash you are you are going to die it's going to happen to most everybody in this room but you don't have to worry you don't have to fear and you don't have to dread because there's somebody on his way to the river to meet you how does he know I'm coming all of heaven will know your arrival there's nothing that God can help you through well why don't he come and snatch me why don't he come and shake me why don't he come and

the ports of Ghana when Benjamin and Joshua and I were there some years back we went to the prison where the slaves were kept at night the day of their departure and we saw the place where the ships would would would part and the little dingy boats would come in and get the slaves out of the back of those little rock stone prisons and take them out brother brandham tells a story about a slave owner who had a bunch of slaves and somebody wanted to buy some of those slaves how hard how horrid how horrid how terrible how awful how horrible to think of human beings like animals I'm embarrassed to say he wanted to buy some slaves he went with the owner to to the field and said I'd like to see the slaves you have and he said what about that one he seems to be different than all the rest ha whoop you tell me your circumstances determine your demeanor you tell me that what's going on your in your life gives you the right on to act like you have not a friend in the world come on here was a slave he had the same stripes on his back that all the other slaves had he had the same cornbread to eat that all the other slaves had but he had his head up while he worked he squared his shoulders
