[1:01:24] Hallelujah by the

[1:01:32] may be seated just a moment and by the
[1:01:35] word of Our
[1:01:37] Testimony we're
[1:01:40] overcoming praise God that was
[1:01:44] good good I knew it was going to be when
[1:01:47] you're playing the introduction I could
[1:01:50] already feel it and I'm so thankful and
[1:01:53] we didn't know for sure so we didn't
[1:01:54] mention it Tuesday night but the song
[1:01:57] that Kade sang Tuesday night is one the
[1:01:59] Lord had given him and it was
[1:02:01] exceptional and we kind of thought it
[1:02:03] might be when we couldn't find the words
[1:02:05] anywhere but it was a blessing if you
[1:02:07] didn't hear it go back and catch it it
[1:02:09] was a a real blessing to us we have so
[1:02:13] much to be thankful for I can't tell you
[1:02:16] what a blessing it was I wasn't here on
[1:02:19] Friday or yesterday so when we pulled on
[1:02:22] the campground today and it we saw a a
[1:02:25] circular
[1:02:26] drive after all these years a way to get
[1:02:30] down and a way to get up and it looked
[1:02:32] like it had been paved it's not paved
[1:02:35] but it looked like it had been paved and
[1:02:38] uh we've got more room to park and it
[1:02:41] was a 3day all day Affair I think to get
[1:02:45] it looking this way you know we are
[1:02:49] blessed so
[1:02:52] blessed we're blessed to have brother gy
[1:02:54] at the helm of this project we are
[1:02:57] blessed to have brother Josh Yantis and
[1:03:01] his brothers and his helpers that that
[1:03:04] help him he has the
[1:03:06] knowhow and he has the
[1:03:08] equipment to get it
[1:03:11] done you know it's pretty good when you
[1:03:13] know somebody that's got heavy equipment
[1:03:16] they just pull it over here and get the
[1:03:18] work done we're ex so so blessed so
[1:03:23] thankful if you say too much much he
[1:03:26] gets sheepish
[1:03:33] but we believe the Lord's going to make
[1:03:35] a way to pay the hangers and to pay the
[1:03:37] finishers and to pay what else needs to
[1:03:40] be done because there are many folks
[1:03:42] traveling over the course of the next
[1:03:44] few weeks and uh so we have to have it
[1:03:47] done but that's nice because then you
[1:03:50] can critique the job and you can ask
[1:03:52] them to do it like you want to do it if
[1:03:53] they don't do it you can have them do it
[1:03:55] again
[1:03:56] and it's going to be so nice we are so
[1:03:59] blessed God is so good to all of us

[1:09:30] North Canada so many God bless every one
[1:09:34] of you pul is leaving this afternoon for
[1:09:37] Iceland to be gone for a few days it's a
[1:09:41] it's a a bit of a business uh trip but
[1:09:44] there will be Ministry involved because
[1:09:47] he has a heart for Iceland and we're
[1:09:50] going to pray for him while he's away
[1:09:52] that God will use him in Mighty ways
[1:09:54] we're also going to pray that the favor
[1:09:56] of the Lord will fall upon the project
[1:10:00] uh that they're working on through
[1:10:02] gospel channel and that it will be
[1:10:04] blessed and that it will be a a a source
[1:10:08] of Grace
[1:10:10] provision uh for the kingdom of God for
[1:10:13] the work of the ministry television work
[1:10:15] is very very expensive work and when you
[1:10:19] are watching carefully your content well
[1:10:24] it's not easy to find the kind of
[1:10:26] content that you want and when you do
[1:10:30] they don't pay very
[1:10:32] well you know so we need to keep that
[1:10:36] Ministry
[1:10:37] going I saw in my files this week Hawk I
[1:10:41] didn't mention it to you but I have
[1:10:43] always given brother peric green the the
[1:10:46] credit for mentioning brother Erikson to
[1:10:49] me the first time but I I knew there was
[1:10:51] someone else but I couldn't remember it
[1:10:55] and I opened up my file and I had a
[1:10:58] letter from a brother in Florida I don't
[1:11:00] even know if that brother's still alive
[1:11:03] he had written the letter in
[1:11:05] 1991 and he said you need to make
[1:11:08] contact with brother Eric Ericson in
[1:11:11] iand so I heard the name first then and
[1:11:14] we have been praying for the work there
[1:11:16] for some time may God just continue to
[1:11:19] use it we believe that it's going to
[1:11:21] play a very important role at the end of
[1:11:24] the end
[1:11:26] when this little bride gets out of here
[1:11:28] folks are going to be scrambling to find
[1:11:31] something that will help them get
[1:11:32] through what's going to happen in this
[1:11:34] world television would be one of the
[1:11:37] most powerful sources that could be used
[1:11:40] in a time of worldwide crisis like the
[1:11:43] exit of the Bride do you understand that
[1:11:45] do you agree and we know that somehow
[1:11:49] every nation of the world is going to
[1:11:51] see the bodies of those two dead
[1:11:53] prophets laying in the street of
[1:11:55] Jerusalem the Bible tells us the whole
[1:11:58] world will look upon their dead body and
[1:12:00] the only way that is possible is through
[1:12:02] internet connection and television so
[1:12:05] you'd never convince me it's it's it's
[1:12:08] trash it's garbage for today it's not
[1:12:11] for the bride but we are thankful that
[1:12:14] it will be used I've told you over and
[1:12:17] over again in the early 50s my
[1:12:20] grandmother was was sitting on the
[1:12:22] platform of the church on Highway 10
[1:12:25] and the preachers were preaching against
[1:12:27] the evil of television and how it would
[1:12:29] cause the church to walk away from truth
[1:12:32] and all of that has happened all of that
[1:12:34] is true and she she agreed and she she
[1:12:38] thought that was just profound and
[1:12:40] wonderful what was happening but the
[1:12:42] spirit of Prophecy fell on her she stood
[1:12:44] up on the back of the rostrom and began
[1:12:47] to prophesy that in the last days God
[1:12:50] would use the medium of Television to
[1:12:53] reach the last Souls the last ones that
[1:12:56] were going to be W would be one through
[1:12:58] television Ministry I believe that
[1:13:00] because the bride's not going to be here
[1:13:02] to preach to
[1:13:03] them are you with me and the Holy Ghost
[1:13:06] is not going to be here to draw them so
[1:13:09] they're going to be looking for whatever
[1:13:11] they could get a hold of that would
[1:13:13] offer them any kind of hope to get
[1:13:14] through the last days of Great
[1:13:17] Tribulation on this Earth I want us to
[1:13:20] be
[1:13:21] ready Matthew chap 24 in this series
[1:13:26] verse 10 and 12 and then shall many be
[1:13:31] offended you don't have to go out in the
[1:13:32] world looking for that church people
[1:13:35] wear their feelings on their
[1:13:37] sleeves uh there they shall be offended
[1:13:40] and shall betray one another and shall
[1:13:43] hate one another never been such an
[1:13:45] hateful hour never been such a deceiving
[1:13:48] hour and many false prophets shall rise
[1:13:52] and shall deceive many if we were to use
[1:13:56] brother brandom's interpretation of that
[1:13:58] word Prophet there we would say
[1:14:01] preacher he said that's what a prophet
[1:14:04] was in this context so many false
[1:14:07] preachers shall rise and somebody's
[1:14:10] going to believe them because the
[1:14:12] scripture said and shall deceive many
[1:14:15] and because
[1:14:17] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[1:14:21] shall wax cold not just sin come on not
[1:14:25] just sin not just
[1:14:28] transgression but specifically iniquity
[1:14:32] because iniquity shall abound the love
[1:14:35] of many shall wax cold are you following
[1:14:38] me it becomes Frozen and then in second
[1:14:44] Timothy chapter
[1:14:46] 1 and verse
[1:14:49] 7 for God hath not given us the spirit
[1:14:55] of
[1:14:56] fear you know recently someone said uh
[1:15:00] posted something like you're always
[1:15:02] talking about the spirit of this and the
[1:15:04] spirit of that and the spirit of the
[1:15:05] other I thought there were just two
[1:15:07] forces there are just two forces but
[1:15:10] there's more than two spirits in the
[1:15:11] world there two forces God and Evil no
[1:15:15] doubt about that but many many
[1:15:18] manifestations and administrations of
[1:15:20] evil and one of them is the spirit of
[1:15:23] fear and we can rest ass sure as a part
[1:15:25] of the overcoming bride that God hath
[1:15:28] not given us the spirit of fear but he's
[1:15:32] given us the spirit of power on the
[1:15:36] spirit of love and the spirit of a sound
[1:15:39] mind there it is not fear but of power
[1:15:43] and of love and let's say that last part
[1:15:46] together and of a sound mind I'm going
[1:15:51] to have my
[1:15:52] mind I'm going to have a sound mind
[1:15:56] because I'm laboring toward the mind of
[1:15:59] Christ I'm reaching for that father
[1:16:02] we're here today not to look at each
[1:16:04] other not to just have Fellowship not
[1:16:07] just to look around and see what we
[1:16:09] might see or hear uh some little piece
[1:16:12] of Gossip or story about somebody we're
[1:16:15] here for your word we're here to be
[1:16:18] taught we're here to be strengthened
[1:16:20] we're here to be corrected we're here to
[1:16:22] be encouraged we're here to receive
[1:16:26] whatever it is that you see that we have
[1:16:29] need of and are ready to feed us we
[1:16:33] position ourselves now spiritually and
[1:16:36] with our gift of faith we pull up our
[1:16:39] our chair we stick our legs under your
[1:16:42] table we've heard the call coming dying
[1:16:46] we're here today to eat at your table
[1:16:48] feed us well Lord don't let anything
[1:16:51] distract us from eating good today uh
[1:16:55] your word Goes Forth to accomplish all
[1:16:59] that it is sent forth to accomplish and
[1:17:01] we will give you glory and honor and
[1:17:04] praise for it's in the name above every
[1:17:06] name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:09] Yeshua our Messiah that we pray and the
[1:17:12] church said amen you may be seated we
[1:17:17] are speaking about the third spirit that
[1:17:23] we were told that we would have have to
[1:17:25] contend with in the bride around this
[1:17:29] proving season that we're in and I don't
[1:17:32] know how long it'll lasts and I don't
[1:17:34] know but what there'll be another one
[1:17:36] after this one but we're being tested
[1:17:38] and sifted and proven we're seeing
[1:17:41] unbelievable things happen things that
[1:17:44] we would have never dreamed of
[1:17:47] politically never dreamed of some of the
[1:17:49] things we're seeing spiritually never
[1:17:52] dreamed of the some of the things that
[1:17:54] we're seeing we're watching people that
[1:17:57] we love that we have had confidence in
[1:18:00] swallow seducing lies people that we
[1:18:03] would have never dreamed would have uh
[1:18:06] been a part of that kind of a move we're
[1:18:09] seeing things that we can hardly believe
[1:18:12] in fact we can't believe our
[1:18:15] eyes we we can't believe everything we
[1:18:17] see we can't believe everything that we
[1:18:20] hear we must every day set our mind on
[1:18:24] the word and come into full alignment
[1:18:27] and agreement with what God has said
[1:18:31] there is a devil there is an enemy he's
[1:18:33] a Seducer he's an counterfeit lion he's
[1:18:37] roaring like a wild man but I'm thankful
[1:18:41] that the The Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:18:45] continues to Roar and we hear his voice
[1:18:49] and we distinguish it above all the
[1:18:51] other voices and above all the other
[1:18:55] noise can you say Amen we've talked
[1:18:58] about some of the ways that that this
[1:19:01] Spirit of iniquity uh uh could can bring
[1:19:05] things affect things in our life and
[1:19:08] we've talked about now the third Spirit
[1:19:12] The Familiar spirit and we've learned
[1:19:15] already quite a bit about how that
[1:19:17] Spirit can behave how it can manifest
[1:19:20] itself in somebody's life maybe somebody
[1:19:23] you love you might even be able to
[1:19:25] recognize this thing operating in your
[1:19:28] life let me say from the onset it was
[1:19:31] not my desire uh initially to help you
[1:19:35] identify these behaviors these
[1:19:39] manifestations of a familiar spirit in
[1:19:42] somebody else's life
[1:19:46] first we we we didn't we weren't trying
[1:19:49] to raise up more fruit
[1:19:53] inspectors we were hoping that you could
[1:19:56] catch a glimpse of your own
[1:20:00] behavior if you're manipulative you need
[1:20:02] to see it if you are distracting and uh
[1:20:07] all these other ways disrupting
[1:20:10] disturbing you need to recognize that
[1:20:13] and when thou art
[1:20:16] converted then you strengthen the
[1:20:18] Brethren then you start looking to help
[1:20:21] somebody else well doesn't that seem
[1:20:23] selfish absolutely not it seems wise am
[1:20:27] Jesus said to Peter these words I'm
[1:20:30] praying for you I'm lifting you up
[1:20:32] because Satan has desired to sift you a
[1:20:35] sweet but really he was saying but I've
[1:20:37] got good news for you cuz on the other
[1:20:39] end of this you're going to have a full
[1:20:41] conversion you're going to have a full
[1:20:42] birth and and God is going to use you to
[1:20:45] strengthen others and to help other
[1:20:47] that's our goal God help us to get right
[1:20:52] in every way so that we can be a life to
[1:20:55] other people people don't just care what
[1:20:57] you say they're watching what you do
[1:20:59] they're watching how you live they're
[1:21:00] watching how you behave they're watching
[1:21:03] how you control other situations instead
[1:21:06] of letting the Holy Spirit do it so
[1:21:08] we're looking at another manifestation
[1:21:11] of of a behavior that runs along uh this
[1:21:16] familiar spirit and it's
[1:21:19] intimidation and coercion now coercion
[1:21:23] and intimidation
[1:21:25] that runs right together with
[1:21:28] manipulation but it's a little bit
[1:21:30] different can you show us the definition
[1:21:33] of
[1:21:34] intimidation uh so that we can get a
[1:21:36] good understanding of that because we
[1:21:39] often want to blame the person who
[1:21:42] causes us to feel
[1:21:44] intimidated but here's the problem that
[1:21:47] person is operating in
[1:21:50] manipulation the problem with
[1:21:52] intimidation is not not the
[1:21:56] Intimidator but the
[1:21:58] intimidate on the problem is that we are
[1:22:02] allowing someone that's how that spirit
[1:22:04] will manifest if he's not manifesting in
[1:22:07] you to manipulate he will manifest in
[1:22:10] you to paralyze you by intimidation you
[1:22:15] can't blame the person you've got to
[1:22:18] look at yourself and you've got to
[1:22:20] realize there's always going to be a
[1:22:22] Goliath
[1:22:25] there's all but if you get your eyes on
[1:22:26] Goliath you'll miss watching the Giant
[1:22:30] Killer we're looking to the Giant Killer
[1:22:34] we're not looking at Goliath we're
[1:22:36] trying to see what's wrong with us that
[1:22:38] our knees are knocking and we're hiding
[1:22:40] when he starts breathing out these
[1:22:43] accusations we want to find out what it
[1:22:45] takes to be a champion we don't want to
[1:22:48] run from the roar we don't want to run
[1:22:50] from the threats we want to run right
[1:22:52] out onto the battlefield and say who do
[1:22:54] you think you are you uncircumcised
[1:22:58] Philistine this intimidation is the act
[1:23:01] of making someone else timid or fearful
[1:23:06] by real or implied threats to frighten
[1:23:11] or threaten someone in order to persuade
[1:23:15] coercion is to persuade by using force
[1:23:19] or threats to apply pressure by bullying
[1:23:24] or belittling someone verbally tearing
[1:23:28] down their own esteem if you're in a
[1:23:32] marriage where that kind of spirit is
[1:23:36] operating it is not a healthy
[1:23:42] relationship a man doesn't have to beat
[1:23:45] down to
[1:23:46] control
[1:23:48] amen a man doesn't have to abuse and
[1:23:53] intimidate to lead are you understanding
[1:23:56] that not a godly man we find that
[1:23:59] bullies and there's a lot of bullying
[1:24:01] that goes on boyfriends will sometimes
[1:24:05] bully a girlfriend girlfriend listen if
[1:24:08] there's bullying going on
[1:24:11] now what do you think it'll be like when
[1:24:13] the license goes
[1:24:15] through you better watch that now you
[1:24:19] better draw boundaries now you better
[1:24:22] understand now that bull buling is not
[1:24:25] to be a part of the marriage not a Godly
[1:24:28] marriage not a Godly relationship
[1:24:31] bullies will use intimidation to force
[1:24:34] their victims to do what they want them
[1:24:37] to do can you imagine that in Chicago
[1:24:41] they would get out in the streets during
[1:24:44] the the DNC the Democratic National
[1:24:47] Convention and they would stop traffic
[1:24:50] and they would refuse these protesters
[1:24:53] anti- Jew je is
[1:24:55] anti-israel protesters they would stop
[1:24:58] vehicles and refuse to let the vehicle
[1:25:01] pass through unless they said we are
[1:25:05] fighting for a free
[1:25:08] Palestine can you
[1:25:10] imagine when when we heard that on the
[1:25:12] news we wondered how would we respond
[1:25:16] you're you're in a busy intersection and
[1:25:18] someone says unless you speak out free
[1:25:22] Palestine we're not going to let let you
[1:25:24] go through the public
[1:25:26] street I'm not sure running over
[1:25:28] somebody would be the right way out of
[1:25:30] that but the Temptation would sure be
[1:25:35] there yes sir do you understand yes sir
[1:25:38] we may never may God help us to never
[1:25:40] have to deal with something like that
[1:25:42] and be forced to make a
[1:25:44] decision because I've got a feeling I
[1:25:47] might bump somebody just slightly out of
[1:25:49] my
[1:25:52] way I don't do real well with
[1:25:55] intimidation the problem is some of us
[1:25:58] are living with that stuff a lot closer
[1:26:02] to our
[1:26:03] lives and we'll never change
[1:26:07] others you can't and even to hope to is
[1:26:12] a form of subtle
[1:26:14] Witchcraft and you don't want to be
[1:26:16] operating in witchcraft trying to change
[1:26:18] somebody else's will you understand
[1:26:22] praying praying against someone's own
[1:26:25] will can easily become Unholy
[1:26:31] intercession you're asking God to force
[1:26:34] someone God is a gentleman the holy
[1:26:38] spirit is a dove God could but he rarely
[1:26:43] does force someone he gives us a free
[1:26:47] will hello so when you're trying to
[1:26:50] manipulate someone's decisions through
[1:26:53] prayer when you're trying to make
[1:26:55] someone do a certain thing the thing you
[1:26:57] think would be the best solution and
[1:26:59] you're using prayer as an excuse that's
[1:27:02] not holy
[1:27:03] intercession that's manipulation and
[1:27:07] Witchcraft what you somebody say well
[1:27:09] then I don't know how to pray for that
[1:27:11] person remember what we said when you
[1:27:13] don't know what to say you've got two
[1:27:15] solutions you can pray in English not my
[1:27:19] will but your will be done on Earth
[1:27:24] in Earth even as it is in heaven or you
[1:27:28] can let the holy spirit of God pray
[1:27:30] through you with groanings that cannot
[1:27:33] be understood and then he knows the mind
[1:27:36] of God but when you get down and start
[1:27:38] praying change her mind change his mind
[1:27:41] change his will uh brother God doesn't
[1:27:44] normally operate like that and not only
[1:27:48] is that a not not a good thing to do it
[1:27:51] will turn on you and you will be
[1:27:53] affected by praying that kind of an
[1:27:55] Unholy prayer it's your will be done
[1:27:58] Lord you know what it
[1:28:01] takes so we don't pray prayers you know
[1:28:04] break every bone in their body but save
[1:28:10] them somebody said that's love no that's
[1:28:13] not quite
[1:28:15] love may make you feel like you're
[1:28:17] loving but that's manipulative you don't
[1:28:20] have to tell God how to get them now I
[1:28:22] got to be honest sometimes I say get
[1:28:24] them God and I leave it
[1:28:28] alone you you you you can get them with
[1:28:31] with with
[1:28:33] Compassion or you can snatch a knot in
[1:28:36] them it's up to you just you see what's
[1:28:39] going on you go deal with them and he
[1:28:42] will it's better to do that we're not in
[1:28:44] we're not Intimidators we're not those
[1:28:47] who operate in coercion and we're not
[1:28:49] trying to get the Holy Ghost to control
[1:28:52] other people's lives who are not yet
[1:28:54] willing to surrender to the perfect will
[1:28:57] and Leadership of the Lord so bullies
[1:29:00] use intimidation to force their victims
[1:29:02] to do what they want them to do I want
[1:29:04] you to know the days of of bullying
[1:29:08] being only on the playground in school
[1:29:11] that's over with bullying takes place
[1:29:14] all the time on the work on the
[1:29:16] workforce on the job in
[1:29:20] families you can't do it my way we just
[1:29:23] won't do it at all in families in
[1:29:26] families selfishness in
[1:29:29] families pouting and bullying come on
[1:29:32] folks the word timid is in the middle of
[1:29:37] the word
[1:29:38] intimidation and aptly describes the
[1:29:41] state of nervousness caused by a
[1:29:44] particular person who's operating in a
[1:29:48] spirit of manipulation or intimidation
[1:29:51] however intimidation is not always the
[1:29:55] result of another person's actions
[1:29:58] situations also have the power to create
[1:30:02] intimidation if someone has a tendency
[1:30:05] toward timidity which by the way is not
[1:30:08] meekness and it is not humility if
[1:30:11] you've got the def the American
[1:30:13] dictionary definition of timidity and if
[1:30:15] you think being timid means humble
[1:30:18] you're wrong if you think timid means
[1:30:21] being uh uh what was the other word I I
[1:30:25] used humble
[1:30:28] humility Meek meekness if you think that
[1:30:31] that's what it means you better look a
[1:30:33] little closer at the scripture that's
[1:30:36] not what it is at all in fact the the
[1:30:38] very uh Greek definition from the Bible
[1:30:41] of the word timid is
[1:30:45] cowardice God's not against humility he
[1:30:49] promotes it God's not against meekness
[1:30:52] he requires it
[1:30:54] but God's not real fond of
[1:30:58] cowardice I'll show you some of this in
[1:31:00] a minute some people are especially
[1:31:03] predisposed to be easily intimidated and
[1:31:06] are quickly Paralyzed by fear while
[1:31:10] constantly blaming the other person of
[1:31:12] bullying them he bullied me she bullied
[1:31:15] me no maybe maybe maybe you're not going
[1:31:19] to change the Buller so what you've got
[1:31:21] to do is work on you we've got to get
[1:31:25] you out of that place of
[1:31:28] cowardice and get you to a place of
[1:31:30] Courage so that you can face the battle
[1:31:34] like a holy ghost filed woman of God man
[1:31:37] of God come on without any kind of a
[1:31:41] fear and without running away from the
[1:31:44] problem people often say I don't like
[1:31:48] confrontation I don't know anybody
[1:31:51] much some seem to but I don't know many
[1:31:55] people who really like confrontation
[1:31:58] some people thrive on an argument but
[1:32:01] most people don't like confrontation but
[1:32:03] I want you to know as Spirit-filled
[1:32:05] children of God sometimes we have to
[1:32:08] face
[1:32:09] it head on face to face we can't run
[1:32:14] away from it because we recognize that
[1:32:17] if we let the enemy get by with
[1:32:20] it he'll keep using that over and over
[1:32:23] and over and over again I hope you heard
[1:32:26] that some people are especially
[1:32:28] predisposed to be easily intimidated and
[1:32:30] are quickly paralized by fear while
[1:32:33] constantly blaming the other person and
[1:32:35] bullying them either of these
[1:32:37] manifestations either the
[1:32:40] Intimidator or the one who is paralyzed
[1:32:44] by fear and timidity either of these
[1:32:47] manifestations can be a sign of a
[1:32:49] demonic presence most likely connected
[1:32:52] to a familiar spirit one that's been
[1:32:55] running through your family line
[1:32:57] generationally causing each generation
[1:33:01] at least one or two in a family line in
[1:33:04] each generation to become paralyzed so
[1:33:07] that you can't move forward so that you
[1:33:10] can't make a good decision for yourself
[1:33:13] and for those who are depending on you
[1:33:15] may God Deliver Us from being paralyzed
[1:33:20] by fear and
[1:33:22] cowardice God hath not given you say it
[1:33:25] with me God hath not given me a spirit
[1:33:29] of fear but of power and of love and of
[1:33:34] a sound mind let me give you the King
[1:33:37] James version plus the SLS version of 2
[1:33:42] Timothy
[1:33:43] 1:7 this is my translation added to the
[1:33:46] King James for God hath not given us the
[1:33:50] spirit of fear the word fear means to
[1:33:53] idity cowardice
[1:33:56] dread dread this is another place where
[1:34:02] procrastination can paralyze us dreading
[1:34:06] the moment dreading the the situation
[1:34:09] dreading to get in and get her
[1:34:11] done so God has not given us a spirit of
[1:34:14] fear timidity cowardice or dread but of
[1:34:17] power and that word power there is the
[1:34:20] dunamis that's the you shall receive
[1:34:25] power you shall receive
[1:34:27] dunamus after the Holy Ghost has come
[1:34:30] upon you and of love not fileo but Agape
[1:34:34] God's love received and given we receive
[1:34:40] his love and we're responsible to let it
[1:34:42] flow through us and of a sound mind
[1:34:46] which means a sound
[1:34:49] discipline and
[1:34:51] self-control folks we've got to
[1:34:54] discipline
[1:34:55] ourselves we've got to control
[1:34:58] ourselves we can't let emotion rule us
[1:35:02] are you with me yes sir don't look at me
[1:35:04] like you don't know who this is for I
[1:35:06] know your
[1:35:08] name I know where you live I know how
[1:35:12] you operate and the word of the Lord is
[1:35:16] here not to condemn but to convict us
[1:35:19] and to set us free
[1:35:24] he whom the son makes free is free
[1:35:26] indeed is free indeed the Amplified said
[1:35:30] for God did not give us a spirit of
[1:35:32] timidity of cowardice of Craven and
[1:35:35] cringing and fawning fear but he has
[1:35:38] given us a spirit of power and of love
[1:35:42] and of
[1:35:46] what
[1:35:49] calm calm calm down
[1:35:54] and well-balanced
[1:35:56] mind and discipline
[1:35:58] and
[1:36:00] self-control the word timidity means the
[1:36:04] the state of or quality of lacking self
[1:36:09] assurance courage bravery timidity is
[1:36:14] often a paralyzing fear of the
[1:36:18] unknown you know that's what makes me
[1:36:21] mad fear of what we don't don't
[1:36:26] know it's understandable to fear what we
[1:36:29] know but look how slick and Sly that
[1:36:33] devil is he wants us to fear based upon
[1:36:38] supposition what might be what could be
[1:36:42] what could possibly happen how many of
[1:36:45] you are
[1:36:48] guilty my hand is up he doesn't just
[1:36:51] want that to be a passing fleeting thing
[1:36:54] he wants it to be a driving force in
[1:36:56] your life he wants us to be paralyzed by
[1:36:59] fear of the unknown or unfamiliar and
[1:37:03] when some of us step into unfamiliar
[1:37:05] situations we
[1:37:09] overcompensate for our own
[1:37:11] fear and we become
[1:37:20] obnoxious I'm not stuck
[1:37:23] I'm just trying to think of a word
[1:37:25] better than the one that keeps coming to
[1:37:27] my
[1:37:31] mind I don't think I
[1:37:35] will God help
[1:37:37] us Deuteronomy chap 20 and verse 8 seems
[1:37:42] to indicate to us that fear and timidity
[1:37:46] can be
[1:37:47] contagious it says and the officer shall
[1:37:50] speak further unto the people and they
[1:37:52] shall say what man is there that is
[1:37:55] fearful and faint-hearted let him go and
[1:37:58] return unto his house lest his
[1:38:00] Brethren's heart faint as well as his
[1:38:04] heart all you got to do is get somebody
[1:38:08] who is bound with a spirit of
[1:38:11] timidity who has fear operating in their
[1:38:14] life and they start turning back and the
[1:38:18] next thing you know somebody else and
[1:38:21] somebody else and somebody else decid
[1:38:23] that they need to turn back and
[1:38:26] sometimes it rules a whole generation of
[1:38:28] a family everybody waiting on waiting on
[1:38:31] it to you know waiting on the best
[1:38:33] opportunity waiting on everything to be
[1:38:35] made right fixed wide open everything
[1:38:39] falling into place while we sit and wait
[1:38:42] and wait and wait and wait some people
[1:38:45] even get religious and call it waiting
[1:38:47] on the Lord come on now when they're not
[1:38:50] at all waiting on the
[1:38:51] Lord if you're waiting waiting on the
[1:38:53] Lord You're
[1:38:56] praying if you're waiting on the Lord
[1:38:58] You're fasting if you're waiting on the
[1:39:00] Lord You're drawing aside unto
[1:39:04] him being paralyzed by fear and
[1:39:08] indecisiveness is not waiting on the
[1:39:12] Lord if somebody could take a hold of
[1:39:15] that you would know something you would
[1:39:18] understand some
[1:39:19] things come on I your foolishness
[1:39:22] sometimes spoke
[1:39:24] you know well God said we could do this
[1:39:26] and God said we can do that and God said
[1:39:28] we shouldn't do that I'm going to keep
[1:39:30] coming right back to what Bobby Connor
[1:39:33] said I think some people they they're
[1:39:36] hear him they think God's talking a
[1:39:38] whole lot more than he's
[1:39:42] talking you got the Holy Ghost if you've
[1:39:46] got the Holy Ghost he can lead
[1:39:48] you come on now you know the enemy will
[1:39:51] cause a a wife or instance to think she
[1:39:54] doesn't have the Holy Ghost well that's
[1:39:56] convenient isn't it then she's easy
[1:39:59] material to be
[1:40:06] bullied I'm not asking any of you to buy
[1:40:08] my
[1:40:09] [Music]
[1:40:12] lunch I'm going to tell it like it is
[1:40:14] today and tomorrow too if I get a chance
[1:40:18] you see some people mistakingly put on
[1:40:23] timidity and
[1:40:25] fear thinking that they are practicing
[1:40:28] weekness and or
[1:40:31] humility that is a great error I don't
[1:40:35] have time this morning to really Define
[1:40:37] humility to go into the depth of what
[1:40:39] humility is and what meekness is but let
[1:40:41] me tell you something if you're having
[1:40:43] to work real hard to put it
[1:40:46] on it's not a trait that you're
[1:40:50] carrying if you're have if you're having
[1:40:52] to work hard hard to be timid which is
[1:40:55] not something you want to be remember
[1:40:58] that we have misunderstood the
[1:41:00] definition of
[1:41:01] timidity it doesn't mean
[1:41:04] quiet and mousy and it means fearful and
[1:41:09] cowardice so you want to be humble you
[1:41:12] want to walk in humility you want to
[1:41:15] manifest the fruit of the spirit of
[1:41:17] meekness but you don't want to be
[1:41:19] paralyzed by timidity and fear so you
[1:41:22] don't want to be putting something
[1:41:23] something on you know I'm just I'm just
[1:41:25] so humble I I just barely have an
[1:41:30] opinion
[1:41:33] now you know I'm going to tell you
[1:41:35] something if you men were looking for a
[1:41:37] wife like
[1:41:43] that it's just not even natural not to
[1:41:47] have an
[1:41:49] opinion not natural not to have an
[1:41:52] opinion
[1:41:54] and it should be that an opinion can be
[1:41:58] expressed without everything going
[1:42:00] spiritual all of a
[1:42:03] sudden if you have to constantly remind
[1:42:05] someone you're the head of the
[1:42:08] house something ain't working right
[1:42:11] because the Bible said if we love a wife
[1:42:13] like we should love a wife like Christ
[1:42:16] loved the church she would have no
[1:42:19] problem yielding no problem submitting
[1:42:23] because she trusts her husband's
[1:42:28] heart the only way a wife can trust a
[1:42:30] husband's heart is for him to operate in
[1:42:34] love and in
[1:42:36] sacrifice if he's
[1:42:40] selfish oh that's good preaching
[1:42:43] Galatians 5 verse 22 and 23 but the
[1:42:47] fruit of the spirit notice timidity
[1:42:50] fearful and cowardice are not mentioned
[1:42:52] here as the fruit of the spirit but the
[1:42:55] fruit of the spirit is love joy peace
[1:42:59] longsuffering gentleness gentleness not
[1:43:03] timidity and
[1:43:05] fear gentleness goodness you don't
[1:43:08] always have to be the bull in the China
[1:43:10] closet to be right gentleness goodness
[1:43:14] Faith meekness there it is temperance
[1:43:20] self-control against such there there is
[1:43:23] no law that word meekness there in the
[1:43:26] Greek means gentleness mildness and by
[1:43:30] implication it means humility in the
[1:43:35] message Hebrews chapter 6 number two in
[1:43:39] paragraph 495 brother brandham said
[1:43:41] there's not one thing left in the Bible
[1:43:44] listen there's not one thing left in the
[1:43:47] Bible as evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:43:51] someone has asked me recently
[1:43:53] how do I know how do I know that I have
[1:43:56] the Holy Ghost well don't ask anybody
[1:43:58] around this message because they'll give
[1:44:00] you four or five different ways you can
[1:44:03] know none of which are completely
[1:44:06] definitive but here is one of the ways
[1:44:09] he said you can know as evidence there's
[1:44:12] not one thing left in the Bible as
[1:44:14] evidence of the Holy Ghost only the
[1:44:19] fruits of the spirit
[1:44:25] not the
[1:44:26] gifts the fruit of the spirit I preached
[1:44:29] a message years ago fruits on Fire H
[1:44:32] because I got a pack of somebody gave me
[1:44:35] a pack of uh what do you call them LIF
[1:44:37] Savers and the flavor was fruit on fire
[1:44:40] and boy I thought that would really
[1:44:42] preach because we don't just need the
[1:44:45] fruit of the spirit operating in our
[1:44:46] life we need anointed fruit we need
[1:44:49] fiery manifestation yes we do fire
[1:44:54] love there's not one thing left in the
[1:44:57] Bible is evidence of the Holy Ghost only
[1:44:59] the fruits of the spirit find out any
[1:45:01] place that Jesus said so yes sir the
[1:45:04] evidence of the Holy Ghost is the fruit
[1:45:07] of your
[1:45:10] spirit what comes out what holy spirit
[1:45:14] is bringing forth in your spirit Jesus
[1:45:17] said so by their fruit you shall know
[1:45:22] them not because they talked in
[1:45:24] tongues not because they called the
[1:45:27] messenger's name every other breath
[1:45:31] on but because they had the fruit the
[1:45:35] fruit of the spirit is love joy peace
[1:45:39] longsuffering goodness gentleness
[1:45:42] meekness a and Temperance let's get that
[1:45:44] in and the fruit of the
[1:45:47] enemy did you know the devil has fruit
[1:45:50] too the fruit of the wrong spirit is
[1:45:57] enmity can I give you a common
[1:45:59] definition of the word enmity hard to
[1:46:01] get along
[1:46:08] with enmity hatred malice strife and so
[1:46:14] forth that's the fruit of the enemy look
[1:46:16] folk it is not right of us to come into
[1:46:20] a situation again like a bull in a China
[1:46:23] closet and then wonder why somebody
[1:46:26] won't be our
[1:46:29] friend it's because you come in like a
[1:46:32] rhinoceros
[1:46:34] right you come into a
[1:46:41] conversation like the bull that needed
[1:46:43] some
[1:46:44] love
[1:46:46] right you you come into a situation like
[1:46:50] you're going to take
[1:46:51] charge the the Bible said when we come
[1:46:54] in we ought to come in very low and very
[1:46:57] humble and take the lowest seat and not
[1:47:00] present ourselves as knowing
[1:47:03] everything it's very very
[1:47:06] Meek oh the fruit of I just feel it I
[1:47:10] feel the Holy Ghost I feel him putting
[1:47:12] his finger on us and the fruit of the
[1:47:14] enemy is enmity and hatred and Malice
[1:47:16] and strife and so forth that's a lot
[1:47:20] that's the fruit of the enemy so you can
[1:47:23] judge by the way you're
[1:47:26] living by the fruit you're
[1:47:30] manifesting where you're standing with
[1:47:33] God are you manifesting love joy peace
[1:47:36] longsuffering goodness Temperance
[1:47:38] meanness are are you manifesting hatred
[1:47:41] malice enmity strife and so forth and
[1:47:44] Etc it's a big
[1:47:47] question if your whole heart is in love
[1:47:50] with him and you love him and are gentle
[1:47:53] and live with him daily you know you've
[1:47:55] passed from Death un life if it isn't
[1:47:58] and you're
[1:48:01] otherwise you're just
[1:48:05] impersonating a
[1:48:08] Christian you're being
[1:48:11] phony that's right which all carnal
[1:48:16] impersonations will certainly be
[1:48:19] exposed we know that someone recently
[1:48:23] thought they were going to really drop a
[1:48:25] bomb on me and so they told me you
[1:48:29] probably don't realize that there are
[1:48:32] three kinds of Believers in your church
[1:48:39] too if anybody in
[1:48:42] here would recognize it it would be
[1:48:48] me I always have hope that make
[1:48:52] believers can move up I even have hope
[1:48:55] for unbeliever because
[1:48:58] sometimes we're late in
[1:49:01] Blooming sometimes we're operating in
[1:49:04] unbelief and then all of a sudden we
[1:49:07] recognize who we are we step right up
[1:49:11] but of course I know there in this
[1:49:13] Church Believers make Believers and
[1:49:16] unbelievers I try my best not to treat
[1:49:19] them
[1:49:21] accordingly because the Holy Ghost is
[1:49:23] our judge but you you weren't hurting my
[1:49:26] feelings I think somebody thought they
[1:49:28] were really going to get me
[1:49:32] good
[1:49:33] hahaa I already know Colossians 31 12
[1:49:38] and 13 put on therefore the I wanted to
[1:49:41] make sure that you don't
[1:49:42] misunderstand God wants us to be meek he
[1:49:46] wants us to be humble he doesn't want us
[1:49:49] to be timid and fearful put on therefore
[1:49:52] as the elect of God holy and beloved
[1:49:54] bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of
[1:49:59] mind that means not to know it all
[1:50:02] meekness
[1:50:05] longsuffering uh forbearing one another
[1:50:09] preferring one another and
[1:50:12] what
[1:50:14] forgiving this is remember he said I'm
[1:50:17] talking to the elect of God here anybody
[1:50:20] identify as part of his elect am
[1:50:23] forgiving forbearing one another
[1:50:25] forgiving one another If any man have a
[1:50:27] quarrel against
[1:50:32] you fold your
[1:50:35] arms stiffen your
[1:50:38] back Harden your head and wait on him to
[1:50:42] come and
[1:50:43] apologize is that what he said sir no it
[1:50:46] says if any man have a quarrel against
[1:50:49] any even as Christ forgave you
[1:50:52] just forgive
[1:50:54] them just forgive them just forgive them
[1:50:59] just forgive her I'm not going to
[1:51:02] forgive them until they come in P just
[1:51:04] forgive them you say you're the elect of
[1:51:08] God just forgive them quit waiting on
[1:51:12] them to cower quit waiting on them to
[1:51:14] humbly apologize they're probably driven
[1:51:17] by such a spirit they don't even know
[1:51:19] what they've done just forgive them
[1:51:25] somebody say let it go let it
[1:51:28] go let it go it's weighing you
[1:51:32] down they don't care you better care Let
[1:51:36] It Go Ephesians 41 and2 I therefore the
[1:51:41] prisoner of the Lord beseech you that
[1:51:43] you walk worthy of the vocation
[1:51:45] wherewith you are called with
[1:51:48] all
[1:51:50] liness God wants us to oper operate in
[1:51:53] lonliness but not in timidity and fear
[1:51:57] with all lonliness and meekness with
[1:51:59] long
[1:52:01] suffering forbearing one another in love
[1:52:05] that word loneliness there it's a m long
[1:52:09] in the Greek it means humility
[1:52:11] humbleness of Mind loneliness of mind
[1:52:15] the having a humble opinion of
[1:52:19] one's self
[1:52:25] when you
[1:52:28] constantly
[1:52:31] regurgitate smack
[1:52:35] talk
[1:52:38] emulation striving with
[1:52:41] competition maybe it's just a
[1:52:44] joke maybe you don't mean anything by it
[1:52:48] but the reality is it certainly doesn't
[1:52:52] present itself as having a humble
[1:52:56] opinion of
[1:52:59] oneself you can be proud of your
[1:53:01] accomplishments without being full of
[1:53:04] Pride you can be glad when you've
[1:53:07] achieved something without thinking too
[1:53:09] much of yourself come on he's calling us
[1:53:12] to loneliness and meekness modesty
[1:53:16] humility loneliness of mind this is how
[1:53:20] the spirit of Christ operates so don't

[1:55:20] heal the sick they cast out Devils they
[1:55:23] speak with tongues they see Visions
[1:55:26] sir I thought only brother brandom was
[1:55:29] allowed a vision I thought only prophets
[1:55:31] of an Old Testament nature were allowed
[1:55:33] to see Vision I thought we had redefined
[1:55:37] the Book of Joel I thought we had
[1:55:39] explained it all away but here he is
[1:55:42] saying as they go along they heal the
[1:55:45] sick they cast out Devils they speak
[1:55:47] with tongues they see visions and they
[1:55:51] walk with God they talk with God no
[1:55:54] devil can move them they're
[1:55:58] steadfast cuz they've entered into rest
[1:56:01] forgetting those things in the past I'm
[1:56:05] free from the guilt of to of free from
[1:56:07] the fear of tomorrow I'm free from the
[1:56:09] guilt of the past they press towards the
[1:56:12] mark of the high calling in Christ Jesus
[1:56:14] there they are there they are that's
[1:56:17] that church that bride church can you
[1:56:21] say amen thank God thank God thank
[1:56:27] God now in First Peter chapter 5:8 let's
[1:56:31] go
[1:56:32] there be
[1:56:34] sober be
[1:56:36] vigilant because your adversary the
[1:56:38] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[1:56:41] seeking whom he may
[1:56:45] devour all right in the
[1:56:48] Amplified it says be well balanced
[1:56:51] temperate sober of mind be vigilant and
[1:56:55] cautious at all times for that enemy of
[1:56:59] yours the Devil roams around like a lion
[1:57:03] roaring in Fierce hunger seeking someone
[1:57:06] to do what to seize upon and devour
[1:57:11] it'll be you if you let
[1:57:15] him I don't know if any of you have ever
[1:57:17] heard of Young's literal
[1:57:19] translation of the Bible but it's an
[1:57:22] important translation to look at
[1:57:24] sometime because when it says literal
[1:57:26] that's exactly what it means only the
[1:57:30] words that are actually
[1:57:33] there
[1:57:35] appear and when you start taking a look
[1:57:38] at a literal
[1:57:40] translation you'll find out that there
[1:57:43] are lots of words added to a verse of
[1:57:45] scripture to help us understand it even
[1:57:48] in the good
[1:57:50] old favorite of the Catholic Church King
[1:57:55] James right there right there the
[1:57:59] literal Young's particular uh has a way
[1:58:02] of but the problem with it is it doesn't
[1:58:06] do any
[1:58:08] inverting and we know especially in
[1:58:11] Hebrew we read
[1:58:12] backwards and even in Greek certain
[1:58:15] phrases would appear backward in a
[1:58:17] literal translation so you can really
[1:58:20] get a little thrown off if you were
[1:58:21] going to say for instance I'd like to
[1:58:23] start reading in the literal translation
[1:58:25] well you you'd get a little twisted up
[1:58:28] because there a lot of the the ANS and
[1:58:31] and these and the Artic thems and a lot
[1:58:33] of things that would be added for for uh
[1:58:36] understanding won't be there so you'll
[1:58:38] just be kind of muddling around but
[1:58:40] there was a man who did a marvelous job
[1:58:44] with a literal translation of the
[1:58:46] scripture I've been aware of it for some
[1:58:49] time I've used it in my own study but
[1:58:51] I've never I've never shared h a verse
[1:58:55] of it with you before and because there
[1:58:58] are all kinds of uh churches and
[1:59:00] denominations and groups out there that
[1:59:03] use it and sometimes people are guilty
[1:59:07] by association and if you found out that
[1:59:10] you know someone out there in another uh
[1:59:12] cult likee group were to use this
[1:59:15] translation well maybe you'd be afraid
[1:59:17] of it altogether uh if that's the case
[1:59:20] please don't ever use the
[1:59:24] diaglot because the the the source that
[1:59:27] brother bam mentioned the diaglot well
[1:59:29] it's
[1:59:30] sanctioned by by 7-Day Adventists and uh
[1:59:35] Mormons the Church of Jesus Christ of
[1:59:36] Latter-day Saints and and many other
[1:59:39] groups like that but it's it's just
[1:59:42] simply a source of looking at what a
[1:59:45] word means so it doesn't matter who else
[1:59:48] adopts it right we got the same Bible
[1:59:51] this man's name was was JB
[1:59:53] Rotherham and his version is called the
[1:59:56] emphasized version and it is a literal
[2:00:00] translation using Hebrew words and Greek
[2:00:03] words but for for ease of understanding
[2:00:06] he will invert which is a common a
[2:00:09] common way of doing it in Translation he
[2:00:11] will invert a sentence which puts the
[2:00:14] subject in the right place and the verb
[2:00:15] in the right place and the preposition
[2:00:17] in the right place instead of reading it
[2:00:19] through and and rotham looked at First
[2:00:22] Peter 5'8 and he said be
[2:00:25] sober Be
[2:00:27] watchful your slanderous adversary and I
[2:00:31] said if anybody caught it if anybody
[2:00:35] expressed it Rotherham must have dealt
[2:00:39] with that Old
[2:00:41] Devil the Old Testament I think didn't
[2:00:44] even appear his translation didn't even
[2:00:46] appear on the scene until 1902 so that
[2:00:49] was way back there that he was dealing
[2:00:51] with the ad
[2:00:52] slanderous how many of you have ever
[2:00:54] found your enemy is a slanderous
[2:00:58] adversary as he caught it he made sure
[2:01:02] that the literal translation didn't lose
[2:01:06] its reality and say a roaring lion he
[2:01:10] caught it as a roaring lion like a
[2:01:15] roaring lion a counterfeit lion is
[2:01:19] walking about seeking
[2:01:24] I've told you before he doesn't want to
[2:01:26] just chew on you he wants to consume you
[2:01:30] he wants to completely devour you now in
[2:01:34] case you doubt this I know that a lot of
[2:01:37] folks aren't interested in Breaking this
[2:01:38] down but we're going too quickly in the
[2:01:41] original the word sober is the Greek
[2:01:44] word Neo it means
[2:01:47] discreet so God is saying through the
[2:01:49] Apostle be discre
[2:01:52] Creet be
[2:01:55] self-controlled it means to watch and be
[2:01:58] calm and
[2:02:01] collected in
[2:02:04] spirit didn't mean
[2:02:07] aggressive it means
[2:02:09] confident you don't have to be nearly as
[2:02:12] aggressive church I hope somebody's
[2:02:14] hearing me you don't have to be nearly
[2:02:16] as aggressive when you're
[2:02:19] confident to be temperate circumspect to
[2:02:22] govern both the outward and the inward
[2:02:24] Man by the rules of temperance modesty
[2:02:28] and mortification which means mortifying
[2:02:30] and strengthening cares will intoxicate
[2:02:33] the soul this is right from the from the
[2:02:36] Lexicon therefore be sober cares burdens
[2:02:41] worries family troubles job troubles car
[2:02:46] troubles will intoxicate the mind and
[2:02:49] the will and the emotion but God said
[2:02:52] you''ve got to be sober anyway you've
[2:02:55] got to be self-controlled anyway You've
[2:02:57] Got to Be watchful anyway you've got to
[2:03:00] be discreet and temperate and
[2:03:02] circumspect anyway you've got to govern
[2:03:05] both the outward and the inward Man by
[2:03:09] Temperance which is by
[2:03:11] self-control the word Vigilant be sober
[2:03:14] be vigilant Vigilant is a Greek word
[2:03:17] that means to keep
[2:03:19] awake to give strict attention to be
[2:03:22] cautious active watchful to take heed
[2:03:25] lest through remission and
[2:03:28] carelessness some destructive Calamity
[2:03:32] suddenly overtake you I want you to know
[2:03:35] if we were watching we could see the
[2:03:37] enemy
[2:03:39] approaching the reason why he catches Us
[2:03:42] by surprise is we are Intoxicated by the
[2:03:46] cares of this life and we're not
[2:03:48] watching like we need to watch God help
[2:03:51] us amen God help
[2:03:53] us be sober be vigilant because your
[2:03:57] adversary the devil the lion walketh
[2:04:00] about I want to show you this word about
[2:04:04] if this don't sound like your your enemy
[2:04:06] this word about you wouldn't think it
[2:04:09] means this in English it doesn't
[2:04:11] necessarily say all of this but in the
[2:04:13] Greek it means to prow
[2:04:16] around without
[2:04:18] discipline your slandering enemy come on
[2:04:23] your slandering enemy prows
[2:04:30] around without
[2:04:32] discipline no
[2:04:34] control to
[2:04:36] Rove to go here and
[2:04:40] there you know sometimes we just need to
[2:04:42] be
[2:04:45] still sometimes we just need to stay
[2:04:50] put sometimes we just need to be mindful
[2:04:54] of the Season amen oh that's good
[2:04:57] preaching yes sir I don't say that too
[2:05:00] much but it is good preaching why
[2:05:03] because it's appropriate for where we
[2:05:06] are to prow around without discipline to
[2:05:09] Rove to go here and there to surround to
[2:05:11] Encompass look at this the Greek or
[2:05:15] coming from all
[2:05:17] angles that's your slithering
[2:05:23] deceiving
[2:05:25] slandering
[2:05:26] adversary and he doesn't like to come at
[2:05:29] you one way what does he like to
[2:05:32] do he'll touch every one of your soulish
[2:05:37] emotions he'll touch every vulnerable
[2:05:39] place in your life he'll press all the
[2:05:42] buttons that he knows you have come on
[2:05:45] and he wants to do what devour you look
[2:05:49] at the word devour it means to drink to
[2:05:51] swallow gulp down to engulf to submerge
[2:05:56] to drown to overwhelm to waste to
[2:06:00] destroy completely to
[2:06:04] annihilate he doesn't want to just gum
[2:06:06] on your arm he doesn't just want to take
[2:06:09] a chunk out of you he is seeking walking
[2:06:12] about coming at you from every angle
[2:06:15] because he wants to eat you up until
[2:06:18] there is nothing left you need to stand
[2:06:21] up today break out of the spirit of
[2:06:23] timidity and cowardness Destroy from
[2:06:26] your life the spirit of fear and raise
[2:06:29] up in the courage and the boldness of
[2:06:32] the Lord and say enough is enough is
[2:06:36] enough is enough is
[2:06:39] enough I've listened to your lies the
[2:06:43] last
[2:06:45] time the slanderous adversary that
[2:06:49] hypocrite imitator
[2:06:52] likes to turn us against each
[2:06:59] other so that he can
[2:07:03] relax while we devour one another Chief
[2:07:07] Joseph said it that
[2:07:09] way he's talked about the he was the
[2:07:13] government leison for the for the
[2:07:16] Nations of First Nations or Native
[2:07:19] American people
[2:07:21] they called him a
[2:07:23] traitor his own people called him a
[2:07:25] traitor because he tried to enter into
[2:07:27] agreement with the nation with our
[2:07:29] nation with the United States to try to
[2:07:31] bring the Indian nations into a place of
[2:07:34] provision and
[2:07:35] freedom and they they opposed him and
[2:07:38] they called him a coward and really he
[2:07:41] was one of the most noble Chiefs of them
[2:07:43] all not Desiring to sell out his people
[2:07:47] but realizing that they were defenseless
[2:07:49] against the strength of this nation and
[2:07:52] the best way to to provide a future for
[2:07:55] their people would have been to
[2:07:59] cooperate somebody has to be The
[2:08:02] Negotiator sometime somebody has to take
[2:08:04] an unpopular stand sometime Chief Joseph
[2:08:07] was that man and he often said this but
[2:08:10] in his address his initial inaugural
[2:08:12] address as Le uson to the government he
[2:08:15] said to his own people where the tribes
[2:08:18] of the nations were gathered together we
[2:08:20] have fought too many insignificant Wars
[2:08:25] among
[2:08:27] ourselves Creek against Chu
[2:08:30] toow Apache against
[2:08:34] Cherokee and now that the real enemy has
[2:08:37] come we have so we have fought so many
[2:08:40] insignificant Wars among ourselves and
[2:08:43] now that the real enemy has come we are
[2:08:45] too weak and
[2:08:48] defeated to stand against them
[2:08:52] that's why he decided we better try to
[2:08:54] cooperate or we'll have nothing left of
[2:08:56] the nation that we have possessed and
[2:08:59] held it could be the anthem of the
[2:09:02] church what Chief Joseph said about the
[2:09:05] Indian nations could be said about about
[2:09:08] Believers even around this message we
[2:09:11] fought so many insignificant Wars among
[2:09:13] ourselves that when the enemy shows up
[2:09:16] and here he is in the end time wanting
[2:09:18] to chew us up and swallow us for lunch
[2:09:22] and we're still worried about you know
[2:09:25] making sure that every word is
[2:09:29] infallible and building some icon that
[2:09:32] we can all look to and call it
[2:09:35] Jesus when he lives in
[2:09:37] us he's
[2:09:39] here this is the house he's
[2:09:42] building we we like to
[2:09:46] immortalize and uh exonerate the signs
[2:09:51] while failing to hear the
[2:09:55] voice the voice said I'm want to have a
[2:09:58] church here that's going to go forth in
[2:10:00] power and have control over her emotions
[2:10:03] in her tongue didn't I pretty well read
[2:10:05] that for you in just a moment this enemy
[2:10:08] in Galatians 515 and 16 in the Amplified
[2:10:12] but if you bite and devour one another
[2:10:15] do you remember you remember in the in
[2:10:17] the
[2:10:19] laws of diet
[2:10:25] when God said through the prophet
[2:10:29] Moses eat this don't eat
[2:10:33] that eat this don't eat that a lot of
[2:10:38] new testament Christians like to take
[2:10:40] New Testament scripture out of
[2:10:43] context and they like to use a story
[2:10:46] that has to do with going with the
[2:10:49] gospel to the Gentiles
[2:10:52] has nothing to do with
[2:10:53] food uh but they like to take that story
[2:10:56] of going to the gospel with the Gentiles
[2:10:59] and and and and decide that God has
[2:11:02] changed his mind and that we should then
[2:11:05] be able to eat whatever we want to as
[2:11:08] long as we bless it that's
[2:11:10] incorrect I'm never going to make a big
[2:11:13] thing over that again but it's incorrect
[2:11:16] it's just simply incorrect do what you
[2:11:19] will but don't pretend to twist the
[2:11:23] meaning of a
[2:11:26] scripture while you eat your ham
[2:11:30] sandwich amen means nothing he tells us
[2:11:34] what kind of birds we can eat and he
[2:11:37] bases a lot of this God was his idea not
[2:11:42] Moses he bases this on oft times on how
[2:11:47] they
[2:11:48] behave what they eat because in in in
[2:11:52] that early time of God giving those laws
[2:11:55] of diet for Moses we're assuming that
[2:11:58] the animals were rather pure they didn't
[2:12:01] eat uh you know genetically modified
[2:12:05] food they ate whatever grew so there's a
[2:12:08] possibility that even uh bottom feeding
[2:12:12] fish and and uh you know carry on eating
[2:12:16] animals would be much cleaner then than
[2:12:19] they are now but when God was giving
[2:12:21] this law of diet he did it this way
[2:12:24] because he probably looked ahead in time
[2:12:28] and he saw such an
[2:12:30] hour that that the animals if they're
[2:12:35] not natural fed and grassfed they are
[2:12:38] being
[2:12:40] fed grain that has been genetically
[2:12:43] modified from what it was supposed to be
[2:12:45] in the beginning which changes the
[2:12:48] physical Anatomy
[2:12:52] and and the processing of the body and
[2:12:55] that's why people get full of
[2:12:57] parasites and that's why people have so
[2:12:59] many problems brother brandham read in
[2:13:01] the reader digest that hybrid food even
[2:13:05] in his generation was causing a change
[2:13:08] in the anatomy of the human body he said
[2:13:12] it was causing men's bodies to become
[2:13:14] more like women and women's bodies to
[2:13:17] become more like men how would it know
[2:13:19] to do that because it was working
[2:13:22] against the
[2:13:24] hormones and when we're eating things
[2:13:27] that work against the hormones it's
[2:13:30] going to affect us Satan has more than
[2:13:33] one way of emasculating a
[2:13:38] man so he decides to fill them full of
[2:13:45] soy which changes the levels of male
[2:13:48] hormones in their body
[2:13:51] and over a period of overc consumption
[2:13:54] of soy products a man loses his ability
[2:13:57] to be
[2:14:01] fertile and yet the health gurus
[2:14:04] continue to tell us that tofu and soy
[2:14:08] milk is the best way to
[2:14:10] go and people continue to follow their
[2:14:13] favorite little guy not realizing that
[2:14:17] it's not only changing them hormonally
[2:14:20] it's probably leading to the mental
[2:14:22] confusion that some people
[2:14:25] have over what they're supposed to
[2:14:28] be because in Readers Digest brother
[2:14:31] brandom read back then that the the the
[2:14:34] uh hybrid food he called it we now call
[2:14:36] it uh GMO genetically
[2:14:39] modified uh it was causing a a woman's
[2:14:43] shoulders to become
[2:14:45] broader and her hips to become more
[2:14:48] narrow which closes
[2:14:51] the birth
[2:14:53] canal it causes her to have more
[2:14:56] problems in delivery and for the man it
[2:15:00] was actually bringing his shoulders in
[2:15:03] and causing his hips to
[2:15:07] spread don't tell me there's not some
[2:15:09] plan behind that kind of stuff so God
[2:15:13] was very careful in telling us what's
[2:15:15] good for food and one of the birds you
[2:15:18] know a chicken I don't know how it
[2:15:19] passed the list
[2:15:21] and I eat chicken every day of my life I
[2:15:24] don't know how it pass the list because
[2:15:26] it'll eat its own you know
[2:15:28] what but anyway it did it did it's got
[2:15:31] an ability they tell me to help purify
[2:15:34] itself depending on what it eats so
[2:15:36] anyway I hope so I hope they're
[2:15:38] right I hope they're right I just
[2:15:41] suggest you pay you know a dollar more
[2:15:43] for your I I do I suggest that you pay a
[2:15:45] little bit more eat chicken less maybe
[2:15:48] pay a little more for it and do your
[2:15:50] best to try to get something a little
[2:15:51] bit cleaner than what is readily
[2:15:54] available have you ever gotten some that
[2:15:56] didn't even taste real it didn't have
[2:15:58] the texture of real
[2:16:00] meat I would I would be a little bit
[2:16:03] afraid of that but one of the birds is
[2:16:05] specifically mentioned is the
[2:16:07] eagle do not eat the
[2:16:12] eagle why because the eagle represents a
[2:16:15] supernatural people it represents a
[2:16:18] prophetic people it represents an
[2:16:21] anointing that would arise in the last
[2:16:23] days the overcoming anointing of a
[2:16:26] flying eagle don't eat the
[2:16:30] eagle and here the Apostle Paul says the
[2:16:33] same thing but if you bite and devour
[2:16:35] one
[2:16:36] another in partisan Strife that doesn't
[2:16:40] necessarily mean Democratic and
[2:16:42] Republican partisan it means dividing
[2:16:44] yourselves into little clicks and groups
[2:16:47] if you bite and devour one another in
[2:16:49] partisan strife careful that you and
[2:16:52] your whole Fellowship this is Amplified
[2:16:55] are not
[2:16:59] consumed I don't mind somebody I'm going
[2:17:02] to preach now I don't mind somebody who
[2:17:05] has a gift of discerning of spirits but
[2:17:08] I reject your spirit of Suspicion on
[2:17:13] that's not a gift of the
[2:17:17] spirit it's not right
[2:17:21] to operate in
[2:17:23] suspicion we should always be careful
[2:17:26] who we're in agreement and relationship
[2:17:29] with but I don't appreciate people
[2:17:31] operating in suspicion toward One
[2:17:33] Another We're supposed to love and
[2:17:35] forgive and hope the best and pray the
[2:17:39] best and and wish the best for one
[2:17:42] another and if I need to stay away from
[2:17:45] somebody the Holy Ghost can help me know
[2:17:46] who that
[2:17:48] is don't fall under under the spirit of
[2:17:51] Suspicion and call it Discerning of
[2:17:53] spirits it's not it's not the same thing
[2:17:57] but I say walk and live habitually verse
[2:18:01] 16 in the Holy Spirit responsive to and
[2:18:05] controlled and guided by the spirit then
[2:18:10] you will certainly not gratify the
[2:18:13] cravings and desires of the Flesh of
[2:18:15] human nature without God you see the
[2:18:18] enemy is the counterfeit lion and when
[2:18:20] he Roars he Roars to scare you into
[2:18:23] submission he's the greatest Intimidator
[2:18:26] of them all so don't be shocked that
[2:18:28] when a familiar Spirit operates around
[2:18:30] us it operates with an
[2:18:32] intimidation and a coercion to try to
[2:18:36] force people control people into doing
[2:18:39] what the devil wants them to do it is to
[2:18:41] intimidate us so that we give up and his
[2:18:44] tactic is to surround us and Corner us
[2:18:48] and to come at us from every direction
[2:18:50] ction so we break down emotionally and
[2:18:53] we give in and we let the devil have his
[2:18:56] way somebody ought to say Amen John
[2:18:59] 12:42 I hope this is enough scripture
[2:19:01] for you nevertheless among the chief
[2:19:03] rulers also many believed on him but
[2:19:07] because of the Pharisees they did not
[2:19:10] confess him lest they should be put out
[2:19:13] of the synagogue
[2:19:16] yeah one
[2:19:18] man's influence
[2:19:22] hello one man's influence over another
[2:19:27] hello one man's influence over another
[2:19:30] they believed but they're scared to tell
[2:19:33] anybody what they believed because they
[2:19:35] knew what the Pharisees would do they
[2:19:37] chop them up and have them for lunch
[2:19:39] God's not looking for somebody who will
[2:19:42] operate in cowardice in timidity and
[2:19:45] fear he's looking for
[2:19:47] courageous come on yes sir come on that
[2:19:51] that there's a problem preachers even
[2:19:54] around this message they choose where
[2:19:56] they preach because they don't want to
[2:19:59] do anything to jeopardize another
[2:20:02] invitation in another
[2:20:05] place so they have that's why that's why
[2:20:08] so many of them reach out to me secretly
[2:20:12] quietly
[2:20:15] clandestine to tell me they enjoy the
[2:20:19] services that they stream
[2:20:21] they can't do it publicly on Facebook
[2:20:24] they can't do it out there so everybody
[2:20:26] could see it because it would cut down
[2:20:28] where they get to pre I'm not interested
[2:20:30] in partisan politics in the bride
[2:20:34] church I don't have time for that kind
[2:20:37] of behavior
[2:20:39] right if I wanted to cow to that I would
[2:20:42] hang the pictures in the right
[2:20:45] place right i' do it like they wanted it
[2:20:49] done and then we could slide back in I'm
[2:20:52] not interested in that I'm going to
[2:20:55] stand for what is right for what the
[2:20:57] absolute said that's the Bible
[2:21:03] hello Israel's attention you know this
[2:21:06] IM let me say it this way the
[2:21:08] intimidation will cause us to focus on
[2:21:10] the source of intimidation instead of
[2:21:13] Jesus who gives us victory over the
[2:21:15] intimidation Israel's attention was on
[2:21:17] the giant instead of the Giant Killer
[2:21:20] the more they focused on the giant the
[2:21:21] bigger the giant God their focus was an
[2:21:24] insult to God he could part the Red Sea
[2:21:27] but couldn't defeat one giant or a host
[2:21:30] of giants we must take our eyes off of
[2:21:33] that which is intimidating us and place
[2:21:35] our eyes on the one who gives us Supreme
[2:21:38] Victory and deliverance fear and
[2:21:41] intimidation will keep us from
[2:21:43] possessing God's promises that have
[2:21:45] already been given to us do you believe
[2:21:48] that in the message presuming
[2:21:51] paragraph 22 brother brandom said Joshua
[2:21:54] Caleb stealed the people remember this
[2:21:57] from just a few months ago they said we
[2:21:59] can't we can't take it we just can't do
[2:22:02] it that's all see they were looking at
[2:22:06] the amalekites Joshua and Caleb were
[2:22:08] looking at the
[2:22:11] promise so that devil will try to
[2:22:13] intimidate you get your eyes off the
[2:22:16] Intimidator don't look to the giant look
[2:22:19] to the one who gives power to kill the
[2:22:22] giant and eat him for
[2:22:24] breakfast amen he said so they're
[2:22:27] looking them out Joshua and Caleb look
[2:22:29] at the promise that's a difference
[2:22:31] depends on what you're looking at Joshua
[2:22:34] said we're more than able to do it I
[2:22:36] wish somebody would say we're more than
[2:22:38] able to do it we're more than able well
[2:22:41] I said they're only bread for us why
[2:22:44] they look great they're great we'll have
[2:22:46] great bread
[2:22:50] lots of
[2:22:52] grease good
[2:22:54] bread God gave us the promise and the
[2:22:58] fear of us is on
[2:23:00] them wo while you're busy fearing an
[2:23:04] intimidating devil I want you to know
[2:23:06] that devil really deeply fears you not
[2:23:10] as you
[2:23:11] are but as he knows what your potential
[2:23:14] is and every time you push him back he
[2:23:18] said is this going to be the time is
[2:23:19] that going to be the
[2:23:22] time it will be for you one of these
[2:23:24] days do you believe that when I think of
[2:23:27] the spirit of intimidation I think of
[2:23:29] Goliath who cornered God's people in the
[2:23:31] valley of elah in a critical moment of
[2:23:33] advancement Goliath shouted taunts and
[2:23:36] mockery at God's people all day long to
[2:23:38] intimidate them and stop them in their
[2:23:40] tracks and guess what it was working 1
[2:23:44] Samuel 1710 And1 and the Philistines
[2:23:47] said I defy the armies of Israel this
[2:23:49] day give give me a man that we may fight
[2:23:52] together when Saul and all Israel heard
[2:23:55] the words of the Philistine they were
[2:23:57] dismayed and even King
[2:24:00] Saul greatly what they stopped they gave
[2:24:04] up the worst thing was that they began
[2:24:07] believing the things that Goliath was
[2:24:11] saying three kinds of
[2:24:15] Believers paragraph 80 and Goliath I'm
[2:24:18] coming to a close
[2:24:21] may take me a little bit to get there
[2:24:24] and Goliath many times larger than he
[2:24:26] was great big fellow 14in fingers on him
[2:24:29] now the fingers would be that long see
[2:24:31] 14inch fingers a warrior and probably
[2:24:34] the coat of mail that he had on probably
[2:24:36] weighed 300 lb or more see they had on
[2:24:39] him a helmet probably the metal an inch
[2:24:43] and a half thick a great big giant like
[2:24:45] that walking with a Weaver's needle
[2:24:47] which is claimed to be around 20 feet
[2:24:49] long his spear 20 ft long he had a 20
[2:24:53] foot spear in his hand boy that's a big
[2:24:56] old
[2:24:58] man a man like that could just stand and
[2:25:01] pick up a dozen man and throw them like
[2:25:04] that as they come up what an
[2:25:09] opposition you can't deny he looked like
[2:25:13] an undefeatable foe but in 1st Samuel
[2:25:17] 17:26 David entered the scene in the
[2:25:20] Zeal for the Lord and the spirit of
[2:25:22] justice that David carried and he said
[2:25:26] and David spake to the men that stood by
[2:25:28] him saying what shall be done to the man
[2:25:32] that kth this Philistine and taketh away
[2:25:36] the reproach from Israel for who is this
[2:25:41] uncircumcised Philistine that he should
[2:25:44] defy the armies the
[2:25:46] ranks of the Living God woo
[2:25:51] and we know what happened next he showed
[2:25:53] up Goliath to be nothing more than just
[2:25:56] a counterfeit lion and he did
[2:26:00] it not with a 20 foot spear no with one
[2:26:04] little Stone in a sling he took Goliath
[2:26:07] down and did what what did he do after
[2:26:09] he knocked him down don't let him live
[2:26:12] no don't you let that Spirit once you
[2:26:15] identify it once you divorce yourself
[2:26:18] from it don't you let it hang around
[2:26:20] your
[2:26:21] house you get rid of it once and for all
[2:26:25] cut its head
[2:26:27] off brother brandom said in what is your
[2:26:30] in your hand what is that in your hand
[2:26:31] paragraph 63 picked up these five Stones
[2:26:35] why this great big boasting Infidel
[2:26:37] walked out there and cursed him in the
[2:26:38] name of his Idol cursed David why said
[2:26:41] I'll take you on the end of my spear
[2:26:43] which it was like a weaver need a longer
[2:26:45] than one of them middle tent poles and
[2:26:47] he said I'll take you on the end of this
[2:26:50] sphere little old boy weighed about 110
[2:26:55] lbs that ain't
[2:26:58] much if Goliath's armor weighed upward
[2:27:01] of 300 lbs that means his armor weighed
[2:27:04] three times what his what his opposition
[2:27:07] what the only one who'd stand against
[2:27:09] him weighed come on one man in God it's
[2:27:13] all it takes one boy in God one
[2:27:16] surrendered vessel in God one little
[2:27:18] praying mama in God
[2:27:21] about 110 lbs kind of scraw he draw it
[2:27:24] in little old fella maybe didn't get too
[2:27:26] much to eat back on the back side of the
[2:27:27] desert but he stayed with God it's the
[2:27:29] main thing picked him up I'll pick you
[2:27:32] up on the end of this and I'll hold you
[2:27:34] up and let the birds eat your flesh this
[2:27:37] day that's what the devil said watch
[2:27:39] what David said David said you come to
[2:27:42] me as a Philistine with an armor and
[2:27:44] with a spear and in the name of your
[2:27:46] false god but said I come to you in the
[2:27:49] name of the Lord God of Israel this day
[2:27:53] I'll cut off your head and give your
[2:27:57] flesh to the
[2:27:59] birds that doesn't sound like a timid
[2:28:01] boy it doesn't sound like somebody
[2:28:04] Paralyzed by intimidation and cowardice
[2:28:07] it sounds like somebody who knew his God
[2:28:12] who
[2:28:13] trusted that he was
[2:28:15] able well I'm afraid I'm afraid to stand
[2:28:18] up against the en enemy then he'll walk
[2:28:21] all over you and eat you for a snack you
[2:28:25] can't let that generational thing rooted
[2:28:29] in iniquity cause you to put off what
[2:28:33] must be done you've got to call it out
[2:28:37] deal with it and cut its life off while
[2:28:40] you have an opportunity to do it now is
[2:28:44] the time now is the time one one more
[2:28:48] maybe two more preparation ens Kentucky

[2:28:53] with steel all up and down like that

[2:28:57] across to meet him a little bitty fellow
[2:28:59] about like this and Goliath about like
