TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] hello I'm Pastor Steven Shelly and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the broad broadcast today and tell you that I consider it a great joy to be able to come and share with you the revealed word of God for this what I believe is the last days I believe that we are living in the last days the closing hours of time and uh if there's ever been a time for the Bride of Jesus Christ to awake out of her Slumber and her sleep and come alive as the prophet tells us in the old test it's time to arise and shine for our light has come and our light is the light of the Glorious Gospel of our Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ and we just counted an honor to have a little opportunity in bringing these Bible programs to you I pray that you'll be edified and strengthened in your walk with the Lord and I also pray that if you find yourself in a cold or stagnant condition if you are not on fire fire for God we say or the scripture describes this state as being lukewarm and I pray that God will turn up the Holy Ghost fire in your life that you will be recharged that you will renew and recommit your life to him so that you can be an an instrument a vessel of his glory in the last days we appreciate your emails and your comments that you've made about the previous programs and we invite you to contact us our contact information is available on the screen and we would love to hear from you be sure to send in your prayer request because we have a great team of Prayer Warriors and intercessors who count it a privilege to be able to take your needs Before the Throne of God the Bible says the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and I believe personally in the power of prayer I've seen what God accomplishes when we uh send up our prayer Our petition before him in faith and he asked us to come to him casting all of our cares on him because he cares so much for us what a joy it is to know that we are loved we are truly loved by our father and we have a beautiful and wonderful and capable elder brother even Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ I want to begin a study with you today uh the basis of this study is found in the book of Exodus but it will take us from page to page chapter to chapter book to book older Covenant newer Covenant back and forth and here and ywn and uh but I pray that when we are finished that your heart will be touched and that most of all that you will have a desire to raise above the status quo of dull drum Christianity just average Christianity which is basically knowing to do good knowing what is right but just sort of coasting in I want to tell you my my old Pentecostal granny used to say that that a jelly fish perhaps you know what a jellyfish is it it's h it's a sea creature and it has no backbone and therefore it just floats wherever the tide takes it my granny used to say any jellyfish can go with the flow but it takes a fish with a backbone to swim against the current like a salmon and I'm just asking God to make you a salmon in the Kingdom that you will will be willing to use your Holy Ghost backbone and swim against the flow of of modern society uh swim against the flow of of lukewarm Christianity and rise to a new level of being yield yed if I could encourage you although I don't know how to teach you how to do this but if I could encourage you to be yielded I would encourage you above all other advice to yield yourself to the master become like putty like clay in his hands because he is the great Potter and he is molding and shaping us even the trials of our life even what we have experienced in the past past a very good friend of mine often says that uh he had a word from the Lord concerning his own life Paul Keith Davis and that word was that the pain of your past was preparation for your future and I believe that with all my heart I don't believe that any trial is wasted in the life of a child of God the only thing that would cause a hardship or a loss to be wasted in our lives is is if we allowed our circumstances to make us bitter I often say you're going to be changed by what you go through you're either going to become bitter or you're going to become better and I implore you in the name of our beloved Lord to allow the trials of life and the pain of the past to make you better to cause you to run closer to the Lord please children of God don't pull back when you you're facing a trial pull closer pull closer up to him I often tell this uh little story about a little boy who was about to be paddled by his father and uh I I know that I'm speaking to you in different countries and some of which uh it would be illegal to administer corporal punishment but uh in this story that happened oh so long ago the father was about to to use a a belt or a paddle on his child and when he when he tried to swing back to strike the child on his bottom the little boy reached his arms around his daddy's legs and held on tight and the daddy said move Son I I've got to paddle you now you've disobeyed father and and the little boy pulled away but as soon as his father tried to to swat him again on the seat of the pants he grabbed his father's leg and held on again and the father said Son I've told you you I can't reach you if you if you pull up to my leg like that and the little boy said but Daddy The Closer I Get to You the less the licks hurt and I truly believe there was a lot of wisdom in that little boy's response to his father that day I believe that we get we get licked we get beat about and knocked about by the pressures and tolles of life but the closer we draw to our Heavenly Father oh Hallelujah the closer we get to him the less the pain is the less the licks hurt and so let me encourage you to draw right up into the arms of your loving father and let him hold you through the trials of life and through every circumstance and I want to remind you before we break into this study I also want to remind you that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever and he is still a savior if you're lost lost and undone without him he is still standing before you with outstretched arms he does not need to pay another price for your salvation the price was paid once and for all he offered himself as a Living Sacrifice on our behalf and he shed the perfect blood of God the blood that had been specifically designed and created of his father for the purpose of redeeming mankind and so the price has been paid it is finished as Jesus said on the cross when he was giving up the ghost when his Spirit was leaving his body it is finished and I want to tell you it is finished all you have to do is access the finished work of the Cross by faith turn your faith loose do you believe that Jesus is your savior do you believe that he died on a cross to forgive you and save you from your sins do you believe that he is able to do what he said in his word he could and would do even in these last days if you do and you confess with your mouth and believe in your heart that Jesus is the son of God and that he died and was raised from the dead on your behalf ask him to come into your life uh and in doing so if you believe with your heart and confess with with your mouth the Bible said you will be saved and your house which means you you receive a promise for household salvation you receive a promise for your family to come in and I will join my faith with yours and ask the Lord to bring your lost loved ones as sheep into the fold of our wonderful and loving Shepherd I want to remind you that he is still able not only to save but to cleanse and to deliver if you have an addiction in your life or you are bound by compulsive Behavior if there's something that seems to be driving you to do the things that you desire not to do there is power in the blood of Jesus and there is Deliverance in his name Surrender Your Life to God and and he will give you Authority the Bible said he has given us power over all the powers of the enemy and I believe that word word I don't believe that it's just a verse from a Dusty old book I believe that it is a living reality that this printed Word is Alive and that it lives in our hearts and we can be transformed by The Living Word of God in this hour and then I also want to share that not only can he save us and cleanse us and Deliver Us from whatever it is that the enemy has used to bind us but he is still a Healer He Is A Healer with his stripes we are healed the same Stripes that he bore on his back and the shedding of blood that saved your lost soul and transformed your spirit is the same atonement the same Stripes that bring healing to your body and I know that disease is rampant and I know that people are sicker in this hour than they've ever been but I must encourage you to still still believe that Jesus Is A Healer you're looking at a man who is seen with my own eyes I have heard of what God can do yes and I've heard what he did a generation ago but I have seen with my own eyes the miracle working power of God I have seen with my own eyes the blind receive their sight the deaf receive their healing I've seen the crippled get up and walk and even the dead raised in the authority of Jesus Christ I am a living witness to you that he is the same yesterday today and forever so be encouraged in your faith perhaps you're tired of waiting perhaps your hope has become deferred but I encourage you to keep on keeping on put your heart in uh in the word of God just line up your heart with the word and believe like you've never believed before that God will do what he said he would do I have proven him F folks and I have found him to be true I don't know where all that came from uh I had no intention of sharing all that with you but whoever you are watching this program right now God loves you so much he's reaching out to you and I want you to respond to his call in this hour all right let's look to our study for today I want to read a verse of scripture to you from the book of Exodus the book of chimote or the book of names and it is uh Exodus chap 32 and I'd like to begin reading in verse 35 and the Lord plagued the people because they made the calf which Aaron made and this is a scripture that talks about uh when Moses was up on the mountain communing with God siai and uh 40 days he was away from the people and the people got tired of waiting on him and wondering if he was going to come back and so they began to make their excuses and they began to say we want a God that we can see and so they made with the help of Aaron a golden calf and God was very displeased and as you know when Moses came back down the mountain he was very displeased and a plague fell on the people and many people died that day now I'd like to read Exodus chapter 33 the next chapter and the first two verses to begin our study and the Lord said unto Moses depart and go up hence thou and the people which thou Hast brought up out of the land of Egypt unto the land which I swear unto Abraham to Isaac and to Jacob saying unto thy seed will I give it listen at the promise of God and I will send an angel before thee and I will drive out the Canaanite the Amorite the hittite and the perizzite the hivite and the jebusite now this was the promise to God that it was time for the people to move up and that he would send an angel to go before the people on the way now remember as we go along back to chapter 32 the plague has come the people are stirred up they're Disturbed there's been a uh many people have died at the hand of the sword of the Levites and and there's a lot going on and now God is speaking to Moses I'm not going to lead the people up but I will send my angel that word Angel is a messenger I will send my messenger before you and he will lead you up but Moses was not satisfied with this arrangement I I mean as powerful as it would be for the angel that God sent to come down and Lead You Moses began to negotiate with God he began to let him know I don't know this Angel but I know you and I want you to be the one to lead us up and so in verse uh 10 through 15 of Exodus 33 let's read that and and we'll continue moving on and all the people saw the Cloudy pillar stand at the Tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshiped every man in his tent door and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant Joshua the son of noon a young man departed not out of the Tabernacle there was Joshua lingering behind in the manifested presence of God and he would need need that saturation he would need that uh that impartation of the divine manifested presence of God because Joshua was going to play a very important role in the future of leading the nation of Israel and Moses said unto the Lord listen at his at his uh imploring a at his negotiation he said to the Lord see thou sayest unto me bring up this people and thou Hast not let me know who whom thou wil send with me yet thou H has said I Know Thee by name and thou Hast also found Grace in my sight now therefore I pray thee if I have found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said said my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest and he said unto him this is Moses responding to God if thy presence go not up with me then carry us not up hence and Moses said I don't know this Angel but I know you and I want you to be the one that goes with us now Moses had experience this fa to-face intimacy what does it mean face to face it means that there was no one or no in the way that would hinder Moses from being able to look upon the glory of the Lord and to hear the voice of God and yet we find that it was still not enough there was something in the heart of Moses that was crying out for more have any of you ever had that kind of an experience do you know what it means when the Deep calls to the Deep when there's something on the inside of the inside that says thank you Lord for what I have had in you and what I have experienced in you but oh I need you more today and I need more of you in my life today than I did yesterday friend I believe that is the heart cry of the bride of Christ I've got to have you more and more in my life he then said God you know my name you've told me that and I want you to show me the way into Canaan I want you to lead us again I don't know this angel that you wish to send I want to know you and this desire to know God it reminds me of of the same kind of statement that Paul the Apostle made in the New Testament when he said that I may Know Thee that I may know the power of your Resurrection and and this word know is not about knowledge like we often sort of interpret this in our minds this is an is an intimate knowing it's more than hearing a lecture or learning a lesson or attending a seminar this is more than the transfer of information this is a god encounter and God is going to have a people in this hour that have encountered his presence that have met him in a real and in a tangible way now much of what we access is by faith but I don't want you to come away from that thinking that you can't feel and experience the power of God there are many people who say that all of that ceased in the early church but I want you to know that God has a moed with you he has an appointment with you and if his spirit is calling you or drawing you in this hour then that is the proof you need he wants to meet with you he wants to Rendevous with you and he's after your heart and uh I'm looking in this hour for more and more of God's people to come to a place where they have a personal encounter a personal commissioning you know one of the reasons why we need that in our lives is because the enemy Huffs and puffs and howls and accuses and rages against us those who are trying to hold on to the Lord Jesus in this hour and we need an anchor we need something that will rise up in us that we can use to say to the enemy hey I was there when it happened I ought to know the power of God I've touched him or I have been touched by him I am not a person who believes that this was only for Old Testament Saints to be able to encounter God in this manner and I'm not a person who believes that it stopped in the New Testament and that only New Testament people those who are living in the second temple period are are those who were able to encounter God I believe that I have been blessed to encounter God personally and individually and I believe if you will set your heart toward him and seek his face and put your yourself before him in humility and in honesty and in integrity and you'll begin to cry out to him believing what he has said in his word I believe you'll feel the presence of God I believe God is able to penetrate the darkness and break through in your life so that you can feel him and know that he is real this was the Cry of Moses I want to know you I want to become more intimately acquainted with with you and I want to know you by the spirit I want to know you by the spirit the Bible said that spiritual things are not discerned in the natural they're not understood through through carnal reasoning but spiritual things are of course spiritually understood and God wants us to have spiritual understanding I know that I have not particularly stuck with my lesson for today but I want to end this program by praying for you I don't know if you can feel where you are right now what I feel but I feel in the depth of my spirit that God wants to encounter somebody he wants to meet somebody who's watching this program today he wants to allow you to feel him and to know that he is real and that he desires to do something in your life I feel like some of you are facing family tragedy turmoil and you need to be reminded you have tried to hold on to God for your loved ones for their help for their deliverance and you've grown discouraged let me encourage you today by reminding you that the God we serve is a faithful God he doesn't always move in our time frame because he doesn't just operate in time he is of eternity and he moves out of Eternity and through time and so it doesn't always happen when we want it but he's never too late he is always right on time I want to pray for you in the few moments that I have left father I thank you even though I feel like we didn't move into our study as much today as perhaps I plan I want to thank you for the flow of your anointing that I feel right now and I I want to thank you for each and every person who is watching this program right now and I want to ask you Lord I humbly ask you to move into the room where they are right now by your spirit as they lift their hands up before you and they surrender themselves again to your presence I pray that you will make yourself known in their lives many of them Father are burdened for their loved ones on they have cried out to you on behalf of their friends and neighbors and relatives and they have not seen the Breakthrough that they desire oh Father I ask that you encourage their hearts today and remind them of your Sovereign will and that you move in Heaven's time and we may grow weary but that if we will not faint if we continue to believe you'll always come come to us right on time so Holy Ghost come and do your work I pray in this moment of time in the wonderful name of our Messiah Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen thank you for watching the program today contact us send us an email let us hear from you if your heart has been encouraged today let us know uh it would encourage us to keep on keeping on and until we meet again just seek the face of God and give him praise no matter how you feel give him praise because he deserves the highest praise in the good times and the bad times let's just give God praise thank you for watching the Eagles cry we'll see you next time bye-bye for today [Music]
