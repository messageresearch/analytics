[1:06:19] some of you have made a
[1:06:21] sacrifice you were enjoying your family
[1:06:24] so much
[1:06:26] and you left your family yesterday some
[1:06:29] drove nearly all day to be here for
[1:06:32] service this morning I want you to know
[1:06:34] it's not
[1:06:35] unnoticed I said it to the musicians in
[1:06:38] the back as we prayed together this
[1:06:40] morning there were several of them who
[1:06:42] were away and they could have just you
[1:06:44] know had fellowship with their family
[1:06:46] gone to church with their family this
[1:06:48] morning but they had a sense of uh uh of
[1:06:52] Duty they wanted to be here to to to be
[1:06:54] faithful to to be to be at their post of
[1:06:57] Duty to be loyal and I appreciate that
[1:07:00] more than we would even have words to
[1:07:02] say and we needed them here this morning
[1:07:05] with so many
[1:07:06] missing uh I wanted to to say that I
[1:07:09] hope all of you had a wonderful
[1:07:11] Thanksgiving and uh I didn't take my
[1:07:14] scale I took my coffee to we took our
[1:07:17] coffee machine but I left one thing at
[1:07:20] home I left the
[1:07:22] scale this was one few days I didn't
[1:07:25] want to know body fat percentage muscle
[1:07:28] percentage I didn't even want to know
[1:07:29] how much water I had in me I left it at
[1:07:32] home but this morning it
[1:07:36] screamed three and a half pounds that's
[1:07:39] just wrong but but what can you expect
[1:07:42] when you have uh when you have peon pie
[1:07:44] for
[1:07:45] breakfast and it's it's the only time we
[1:07:49] you just sort of let your hair down you
[1:07:51] know for Thanksgiving week I don't have
[1:07:54] much to let down but
[1:07:56] anyway God is good we were blessed the
[1:08:02] whole highlight of my week I enjoyed
[1:08:04] being with both of my daughters and my
[1:08:06] wife my sons were elsewhere my
[1:08:08] daughter-in-law and and our grandbaby
[1:08:10] but we enjoyed being with them so much
[1:08:12] in such a beautiful setting and uh then
[1:08:16] the highlight of it was last night when
[1:08:19] when they got home and Eliana come to
[1:08:21] see Pap and Nana well that that just
[1:08:24] made it all all go away missing and and
[1:08:28] uh we're just thankful to be in the
[1:08:30] house of God today I I only wanted to
[1:08:33] say just as a moment of tribute if you
[1:08:35] don't mind just just one minute um there
[1:08:39] was a funeral today that I certainly
[1:08:41] would have like to have been able to
[1:08:42] attend it was certainly in my heart to
[1:08:44] be there but I needed to be here today
[1:08:48] instead 92 years old uh precious
[1:08:53] precious sister uh in our family in our
[1:08:56] life for so many
[1:08:59] years um you know there are many people
[1:09:01] out there who they may not be in the
[1:09:03] perfect will of God but they're doing
[1:09:06] God a
[1:09:08] service and uh we know what the
[1:09:11] scripture tells us about uh a woman's
[1:09:15] Ministry and and where where her
[1:09:17] Ministry is but I can't help but
[1:09:21] remember mothers in Zion like sister
[1:09:24] Bale
[1:09:26] 92 years old she assisted me when I when
[1:09:30] I preached my grandmother's funeral 32
[1:09:32] years ago can you imagine she outlived
[1:09:35] my grandmother 32 years they were about
[1:09:38] the same age and uh this woman founded
[1:09:42] many churches for the Assemblies of God
[1:09:45] and and eventually her last church was
[1:09:48] was just an independent Hol in church
[1:09:50] still going strong today still dressing
[1:09:53] clean and looking right and Liv good and
[1:09:57] and uh I don't know how many times I
[1:09:59] have searched the internet for her
[1:10:01] obituary thinking surely she has passed
[1:10:03] and no one told me but I got a text from
[1:10:06] an old friend uh Friday I think it was
[1:10:10] to say that she had had crossed over and
[1:10:14] I just took it a little hard how can you
[1:10:16] take it hard when someone's
[1:10:18] 92 but but I'm not sad for
[1:10:21] her you know I I I can hear her voice
[1:10:25] when I think of her and I can see her
[1:10:28] rejoicing she loved for me to sing that
[1:10:31] song um um one more
[1:10:35] Valley she'd say we're not going home
[1:10:37] today until Steve sings One More Valley
[1:10:41] and I preached my first Revival meetings
[1:10:43] for her when I was 11 years old and
[1:10:47] preached first tent meetings in her on
[1:10:49] her church property when I was 12 the
[1:10:52] thing that I gathered from her life and
[1:10:54] uh I Pres presented baptism to her and I
[1:10:57] presented what God had done for us in
[1:10:59] the message of the hour and it didn't
[1:11:00] seem like there was maybe what she could
[1:11:03] see in it but I just loved her anyway
[1:11:06] and I knew that that she loved me but
[1:11:09] the thing that I remember about her the
[1:11:11] most is her hours of prayer and when I
[1:11:13] say that I'm not exaggerating she would
[1:11:16] spend the night with my grandmother
[1:11:18] sometime from out of town and and and
[1:11:20] she would pray until the we hours of the
[1:11:23] morning in the Holy Ghost
[1:11:25] and if you don't think that makes a
[1:11:27] difference in your life when you're a
[1:11:30] kid and you hear somebody praying and
[1:11:33] groaning in the spirit for hour upon
[1:11:36] hour it makes an impact on your life and
[1:11:39] I would just like for you to pray for
[1:11:42] her family she only had one son and one
[1:11:44] grandson but she had hundreds of of of
[1:11:48] church friends uh who loved her very
[1:11:50] much and who will miss her and um she
[1:11:54] taught me me a lot of spiritual things
[1:11:56] along the way she also taught me how
[1:11:59] amazing mayonnaise is on a hot
[1:12:04] dog you just don't forget those
[1:12:07] things I said sister Bell that sounds
[1:12:10] absolutely disgusting she said now
[1:12:13] honey I don't care what it sounds like
[1:12:16] you tried and if that don't make you
[1:12:18] just want to
[1:12:20] scream I didn't scream but I I sure
[1:12:23] appreciated what she taught me but most
[1:12:25] of all those spiritual things aren't you
[1:12:28] glad that God places people in our lives
[1:12:30] along the way to teach us what we need
[1:12:33] to know in a season aren't you glad that
[1:12:36] the pillar of fire keeps moving on and
[1:12:39] we keep following him to the fullness of
[1:12:41] his word but we shouldn't I tell you I
[1:12:44] don't despise where I came from all
[1:12:47] night prayer meetings and and bobby pins
[1:12:50] flying and uh people crawling around in
[1:12:53] the altar seeking the Lord I'm not
[1:12:55] embarrassed or ashamed of that that's
[1:12:57] where I come from that's really who I am
[1:13:00] I try to behave for some some folks
[1:13:03] sometime you know but really who I am uh
[1:13:06] I was most happy in that kind of
[1:13:08] environment I cannot stand to have to
[1:13:10] sit in the service that that there just
[1:13:13] seems to be no life you know they're
[1:13:15] saying all the right
[1:13:17] things but there's no life there there's
[1:13:20] no witness to what they're saying it's
[1:13:22] the life behind the name and we need
[1:13:25] that operating in our life
[1:13:28] today uh so I just wanted to say that
[1:13:30] forgive me for taking your time for some
[1:13:33] but you've heard me speak of her so many
[1:13:35] times through the years they told me
[1:13:37] that one week ago she was sitting up on
[1:13:39] the side of the bed talking to all the
[1:13:41] nurses and and telling them that they
[1:13:43] needed Jesus and that she was praying
[1:13:46] for them and and uh you need the Holy
[1:13:48] Ghost don't stop till you get the Holy
[1:13:50] Ghost don't just go to some church that
[1:13:52] don't pray for you to you need to get
[1:13:54] the holy ghost you you need to go all
[1:13:57] the
[1:13:57] way and then one week later she's there
[1:14:00] she made it the text that came in said
[1:14:04] uh brother Steve I just wanted you to
[1:14:06] know that sister Bell joined your
[1:14:09] grandmother this morning and they're
[1:14:12] rejoicing I believe
[1:14:14] it I believe it let's go to the word
[1:14:18] let's thank God for these
[1:14:20] musicians thank
[1:14:23] you let's stand for the reading of God's
[1:14:26] word proverbs 4 verse 23- 27 is where we
[1:14:33] have been for a couple of weeks now I
[1:14:35] want to move as quickly as I can I know
[1:14:38] you your time is uh valuable we want to
[1:14:41] Welcome All of You streamers I'm just
[1:14:43] taking a minute to glance here uh from
[1:14:46] all over the world God bless you in Cape
[1:14:48] Town God bless you in southern Norway
[1:14:51] God bless you in Indiana and and so so
[1:14:55] many places I wish that we had time uh
[1:14:58] to to greet you everyone by name and
[1:15:02] Country but we can't do that but we are
[1:15:04] very grateful that you are with us today
[1:15:06] by by
[1:15:08] stream this came from sort of a dream
[1:15:12] experience I had a few weeks ago where I
[1:15:15] I saw a person trying to get over a wall
[1:15:18] in a in in some kind of competition it
[1:15:21] seemed like and they had done quite well
[1:15:25] and were looking quite Fit until they
[1:15:27] came to a final wall and there was such
[1:15:30] a struggle in trying to get over that
[1:15:33] wall I recognized the person and there
[1:15:35] was such a such a struggle and and I
[1:15:39] began to sort of even in the dream pray
[1:15:41] for this individual and and the Lord
[1:15:44] just really impressed on my heart you
[1:15:47] need to tell that person Above All Else
[1:15:50] whatever you do guard your heart
[1:15:55] and that's what we have to do in the
[1:15:56] hour we're in right now your heart is
[1:15:59] not your blood pump I'm not talking
[1:16:01] about the blood pump I'm talking about
[1:16:04] the seed of the
[1:16:06] emotions and I want you to know that
[1:16:08] that's where the enemy wants to trick us
[1:16:11] or trouble us battle Us in this hour is
[1:16:16] in the Battlefield of the Mind If you
[1:16:18] believe that say Amen if you can win
[1:16:21] that battle because Jesus won it you can
[1:16:24] and if you will
[1:16:25] you'll have won the battle it'll be over
[1:16:27] that's it we're going out of here
[1:16:29] Proverbs 4:23 says keep thy heart with
[1:16:34] all diligence for out of it are the
[1:16:41] issues of
[1:16:43] life and that is telling us this morning
[1:16:46] that everything in life flows out of
[1:16:50] your heart the seat of your emotion your
[1:16:54] mind your will and your emotion
[1:16:57] everything that happens to you flows out
[1:17:01] of your heart and if that's if that's
[1:17:03] true then it emphasizes to us the
[1:17:07] importance of guarding our heart because
[1:17:10] the Bible said out of the abundance of
[1:17:13] the
[1:17:13] heart the mouth talks and if you don't
[1:17:17] want your mouth to over talk you've got
[1:17:20] to watch what's in your heart because
[1:17:22] out of the abundance of that heart your
[1:17:25] mouth will do its talking put away from
[1:17:28] thee verse 24 a frower mouth and
[1:17:32] perverse lips put far from thee let
[1:17:36] thine eyes look right on and let thine
[1:17:41] eyelids look straight before thee Ponder
[1:17:45] the path of thy feet and let all thy
[1:17:49] ways be what be established turn not to
[1:17:54] the right hand hand nor to the left
[1:17:58] remove thy foot from Evil sounds like
[1:18:04] really good advice to us this morning
[1:18:07] doesn't it and then if you will just
[1:18:10] give me one more moment uh I'd like for
[1:18:13] you to turn with me to one more place of
[1:18:16] scripture very familiar to you Ephesians
[1:18:20] chapter
[1:18:21] 6 beginning in verse 11 it says put on
[1:18:26] the whole armor of God the Greek says
[1:18:32] complete the complete Armor of God that
[1:18:37] ye may be able to stand
[1:18:41] against the Wilds of the devil is this
[1:18:45] to
[1:18:46] Believers it's to Believers for we
[1:18:49] wrestle not against Aunts Uncles cousins
[1:18:53] wives daughter laws come on we wrestle
[1:18:57] not against flesh and blood but against
[1:19:02] principalities against Powers against
[1:19:05] the rulers of the darkness of this world
[1:19:08] against spiritual wickedness in high
[1:19:13] places even government places wherefore
[1:19:17] take unto you the whole armor of God
[1:19:23] that you may be able to withand in the
[1:19:27] evil day and having done
[1:19:29] all not sit stand you've got to be on
[1:19:34] guard stand therefore having your loins
[1:19:38] GED about with truth truth
[1:19:42] matters and having on the
[1:19:45] breastplate of righteousness that's not
[1:19:48] your righteousness let me tell you what
[1:19:51] God thinks about my righteousness it's
[1:19:54] no more to him than filthy rags it's not
[1:19:58] the breastplate of the believer's
[1:20:01] righteousness it's the breastplate of
[1:20:03] the
[1:20:04] redeemer's righteousness his
[1:20:07] righteousness your feet Shaw with the
[1:20:11] preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:20:14] you're going to a battle you don't wear
[1:20:17] flipflops to a
[1:20:19] battle you've got to put on your peas
[1:20:22] shoes you've got to put on the the shoes
[1:20:25] the boots that will prepare you and
[1:20:28] protect you while going into the
[1:20:30] battlefield above all taking the shield
[1:20:34] of Faith wherewith ye shall be able to
[1:20:39] do what quench all the fiery darts of
[1:20:46] the wicked you may not always be able to
[1:20:48] stop them but you will definitely be
[1:20:51] able to put out the
[1:20:52] fire amen and many of them depending on
[1:20:56] how how good you are how much you've
[1:21:00] practiced you'll be able to stop some of
[1:21:03] them all together but how many of you
[1:21:05] are glad that what you don't stop with
[1:21:08] the shield of Faith there's something
[1:21:10] else protecting the believer and we're
[1:21:13] getting to that take the helmet of
[1:21:17] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[1:21:22] which is
[1:21:24] the word of God do you believe that
[1:21:28] praying
[1:21:29] always with all prayer and
[1:21:32] supplication in
[1:21:35] the spirit when you get in the spirit
[1:21:38] you're not giving God your Santa Claus
[1:21:40] list when you get in the spirit you're
[1:21:43] praying a Jesus prayer as it is in
[1:21:46] heaven as it is in heaven as it is in
[1:21:49] heaven then Lord let it be done in me
[1:21:51] the same way you're not giving him your
[1:21:53] list
[1:21:55] you're saying your will be done amen
[1:21:58] thank God for that gift of prayer and
[1:22:01] supplication and thank God that we have
[1:22:04] in verse 14 the
[1:22:08] breastplate of righteousness father we
[1:22:12] thank you today that you have given us
[1:22:15] another opportunity to gather under your
[1:22:18] word I I see that of course people are
[1:22:22] have traveled and uh they're with weary
[1:22:25] and they're tired there is a refreshing
[1:22:28] that comes by the presence of the Lord
[1:22:31] would you send that to us today because
[1:22:34] we'll never get this moment back we'll
[1:22:37] never capture this particular service
[1:22:39] again if we don't give it what we have
[1:22:43] if we don't open up our heart to receive
[1:22:46] from you we may receive in dozens of
[1:22:49] other services but we'll miss what you
[1:22:52] had for us today so we come to attention
[1:22:56] by the spirit and we stand Lord ready to
[1:23:00] hear the instruction that you have for
[1:23:03] us today thank you that we are
[1:23:06] Overcomers because you overcame on our
[1:23:08] behalf and we'll give you the praise and
[1:23:12] the honor and the glory for it's in the
[1:23:15] name above every name the name of the
[1:23:18] Lord Jesus Christ that we pray and the
[1:23:22] Saints said you may be seated if you
[1:23:25] won't go to
[1:23:29] sleep in the Amplified version of of
[1:23:33] Proverbs
[1:23:35] 4:23 it says it like this keep and guard
[1:23:39] your heart with all
[1:23:42] vigilance and above all that you
[1:23:45] guard you're going to guard a lot of
[1:23:48] gates and things in your life but the
[1:23:51] most important one that you're going to
[1:23:53] guard and protect
[1:23:55] is your heart because what settles in
[1:23:58] your heart your life flows out of that
[1:24:02] if you let bitterness settle in your
[1:24:05] heart how many of you know bitterness is
[1:24:07] going to flow out it's going to flow out
[1:24:10] in your thought life it's going to flow
[1:24:12] out in your word life it's coming out of
[1:24:15] you if you let jealousy settle in there
[1:24:18] then your every filter everything that
[1:24:21] happens to you every reaction is going
[1:24:24] to be filtered through whatever is
[1:24:27] settled down into your heart jealousy so
[1:24:30] Nathan prayed the most appropriate
[1:24:32] prayer today and that is that God would
[1:24:36] heal up every
[1:24:38] wound he actually said
[1:24:41] cariz every wound to keep the infection
[1:24:44] out to to keep the uh to keep whatever
[1:24:47] it is out that would like to cause you
[1:24:49] to be destroyed the enemy can't change
[1:24:52] who you are as a son of God but he can
[1:24:56] change your fellowship with God and he
[1:24:59] can affect your fellowship with one
[1:25:01] another if you will stay in fellowship
[1:25:05] with God if you'll do what sister said
[1:25:08] and you when you don't understand if you
[1:25:10] just lay your head on the chest of his
[1:25:14] sovereignty and know that God is more
[1:25:17] than able to do exceeding and abundantly
[1:25:21] above everything that we would even ask
[1:25:25] or even above our imagination because
[1:25:29] that's who he is while you are guarding
[1:25:32] your life make sure that you're paying
[1:25:35] particular attention to your to your
[1:25:38] heart it goes on to say for out of it
[1:25:43] flow the Springs of of life you know the
[1:25:49] world tells us that we are a product of
[1:25:52] what we have been through I know that a
[1:25:55] lot of people don't understand the
[1:25:56] concept but so many times too many times
[1:26:00] it's the truth because we allow things
[1:26:03] to Lodge there instead of letting them
[1:26:06] pass through let me tell you whatever
[1:26:08] you're walking through today it didn't
[1:26:10] come to
[1:26:12] stay it came to pass now you got to let
[1:26:15] it go look at your neighbor and say you
[1:26:18] better let something go there's some
[1:26:21] things you want to hold on to and
[1:26:23] there's some things that you just want
[1:26:25] to let go come on brother or sister you
[1:26:29] want to let some things go they matter
[1:26:32] now but they won't matter in eternity so
[1:26:35] what about we just make up our mind I'm
[1:26:37] not going to let it hinder me now I'm
[1:26:40] not going into battle with flipflops on
[1:26:43] I'm going to make sure my feet are shot
[1:26:45] with the preparation of peace I'm going
[1:26:47] to take the sword of the spirit you
[1:26:50] don't have to be a preacher to use the
[1:26:52] word of God against the enemy me just be
[1:26:55] a believer just believe it and use it as
[1:26:58] a weapon against him take that Shield of
[1:27:01] faith and use it to quench the fiery
[1:27:05] darts of the enemy and if you can't if
[1:27:09] you can't uh catch it with your Shield
[1:27:12] thank God you wear the
[1:27:16] breastplate of
[1:27:20] his of his righteousness
[1:27:25] let me read Ephesians 6:14 in the
[1:27:28] Amplified I hope I don't offend you by
[1:27:30] doing so if I do it'll pass
[1:27:33] quickly stand
[1:27:36] therefore
[1:27:37] hold your
[1:27:40] ground I I I haven't yet defined the
[1:27:44] verse when I was a child I heard an old
[1:27:47] preacher preaching up a storm and he
[1:27:49] said the Bible said if you give the
[1:27:52] devil an inch
[1:27:55] he'll take a mile well I didn't find
[1:27:58] that in the Bible but I tell you what I
[1:28:01] did find the scripture said don't give
[1:28:04] space don't give any space to the enemy
[1:28:09] because if you surrender a part of your
[1:28:12] heart to that which is negative dark or
[1:28:15] evil the enemy will never be satisfied
[1:28:18] with that little place you give him he
[1:28:21] will always desire to expand until he
[1:28:24] controls the issues of your life because
[1:28:28] what lodges in the heart determines the
[1:28:31] issues of Life did you know you can find
[1:28:34] healing in your body sometime by just
[1:28:37] being healed in your
[1:28:39] heart I don't know if you understand or
[1:28:41] not but God doesn't just want to heal
[1:28:43] your flesh he wants to heal us from the
[1:28:46] inside out he's not just redeeming part
[1:28:49] of who we are but he has Redemption for
[1:28:52] every part of of who we are if you
[1:28:55] believe that you can say Amen having
[1:28:58] tightened the belt of Truth this is a
[1:29:03] good hour to do that in because there's
[1:29:05] all kinds of Lies there's all kinds of
[1:29:08] rumors there's all kinds of Winds of
[1:29:10] Doctrine if there's ever been a time to
[1:29:13] tighten up the belt of Truth to know
[1:29:15] what you believe to believe it with all
[1:29:18] your heart to make up your mind that if
[1:29:20] it's rooted and grounded in the word
[1:29:22] you're not going to give up you're not
[1:29:24] backing up come on you're not looking to
[1:29:27] the right or the left but you're going
[1:29:31] forward through Jesus Christ who gives
[1:29:34] you strength he goes on to say
[1:29:37] tightening the belt of Truth around your
[1:29:39] loins and having put on the
[1:29:43] breastplate of
[1:29:45] Integrity now that's what righteousness
[1:29:48] can do for you the righteousness of God
[1:29:52] can cultivate
[1:29:54] Integrity in your life the world is
[1:29:58] finished with hypocrite
[1:30:01] Christians your neighbors don't want to
[1:30:03] hear your talk if they hear you
[1:30:05] screaming at your wife in the yard they
[1:30:09] don't want to hear your church talk if
[1:30:11] you're not walking the walk if there's
[1:30:14] ever an hour that the bride has got to
[1:30:17] stand up and live what we
[1:30:19] know this is that hour if you think your
[1:30:24] righteousness is getting you anywhere
[1:30:26] you need to give up on that right now
[1:30:29] and remember it is his righteousness
[1:30:32] working in you that causes you to tell
[1:30:36] the truth it causes you to be a man of
[1:30:39] your word it causes you to be a woman of
[1:30:42] your word not fudging not living in the
[1:30:45] gray not trying to find a white
[1:30:49] lie to replace a black one A Lie Is A
[1:30:52] Lie Is A Lie is a lie God's looking for
[1:30:55] a people that will live by this word and
[1:30:59] he's found one in his bride are you in
[1:31:03] that number I trust you are having put
[1:31:06] on the breastplate of Integrity of his
[1:31:09] righteousness and of moral rectitude and
[1:31:13] right standing with God that's because
[1:31:17] of him you can't live clean enough you
[1:31:20] can't live holy enough to get there
[1:31:24] it's only because of him if you believe
[1:31:28] that you ought to squeeze out a little
[1:31:30] amen here you're going to make me work
[1:31:32] for every amen today aren't you I can
[1:31:34] tell but I'm used to you so I'm going to
[1:31:37] move on the Greek says put on the
[1:31:41] complete
[1:31:43] Armor of God did you know if you move
[1:31:47] the preposition and looked at it a
[1:31:49] little closer in the Greek it literally
[1:31:51] would be possessive it literally would
[1:31:54] be possessive in the sense that it would
[1:31:56] be his
[1:31:58] armor now when we read it we read the
[1:32:01] armor of God meaning you know these are
[1:32:04] Godly principles faith and and
[1:32:07] righteousness and peace but that's
[1:32:10] really not what it's saying if you
[1:32:12] looked a little closer at the way the
[1:32:14] Greek is worded and the preposition in
[1:32:16] the different place you'd understand
[1:32:18] that it's actually calling it possessive
[1:32:20] it's saying God's armor the one that he
[1:32:23] has the one that he has created the one
[1:32:26] that he has made for you and I to
[1:32:30] borrow it's for us if we want it how
[1:32:33] many of you want it I'm going to war you
[1:32:36] look folks you're going to war whether
[1:32:38] you want to or not hell is going to
[1:32:41] March against you the devil's going to
[1:32:44] howl against you he's going to breathe
[1:32:47] accusations down your neck he's going to
[1:32:49] sell you half truths if he can spiritual
[1:32:53] war Warfare is not optional it's part of
[1:32:56] the Christian life but we have
[1:32:59] everything we need to defeat the enemy
[1:33:02] anytime anywhere no matter what the
[1:33:05] circumstances are we are well equipped
[1:33:09] by taking God's armor his
[1:33:13] armor the Puritan preachers of yester
[1:33:18] year uh Paul bunan and so many others
[1:33:22] they they really like to emphasize the
[1:33:25] fact that when God was giving us this
[1:33:28] armor that there was nothing to to
[1:33:32] protect the back how many of you have
[1:33:33] ever heard that uh read it and Pilgrim's
[1:33:36] Progress it talks about the fact that
[1:33:38] the breastplate is on the front and the
[1:33:41] shield is used to protect the front and
[1:33:44] there's nothing for the back but that's
[1:33:46] not really the reality of this armor
[1:33:49] that God has prepared it makes a
[1:33:51] beautiful sermon it it it it sounds
[1:33:54] really interesting because we like to
[1:33:56] say well that means you can't Retreat
[1:33:59] you can't ever turn your back on the
[1:34:01] enemy but I'd like for you to know that
[1:34:03] the enemy is
[1:34:05] Sly and he doesn't always come front on
[1:34:09] you know he'll use somebody you
[1:34:11] love he'll sneak around behind you
[1:34:14] sometime and you've got to not only be
[1:34:17] prepared to meet him face on but you've
[1:34:20] got to have something behind you protect
[1:34:23] ing you when the enemy comes in Sly like
[1:34:27] a fox has anybody ever dealt with that
[1:34:31] devil so if you do a little more
[1:34:33] research about this armor especially the
[1:34:36] breastplate I want to read the
[1:34:38] description to you if you don't mind
[1:34:40] early in the first century ad during the
[1:34:44] life of Our Lord second temple period
[1:34:48] the Roman army began to adapt and change
[1:34:52] its armor we aren't sure what the Romans
[1:34:56] called their new kind of body armor the
[1:34:59] one that they started using especially
[1:35:02] in their control of Jerusalem but
[1:35:06] historians call it lorica which means uh
[1:35:11] an armor with segments or with pieces an
[1:35:15] armor made of of different segments or
[1:35:20] pieces the the new armor that would have
[1:35:23] been describe the armor uh that we are
[1:35:26] looking at in Ephesians 6 was an armor
[1:35:30] that was sort of a system of 40
[1:35:33] different segments of metal
[1:35:37] plates so if you can possibly picture
[1:35:40] this I I have a little hard time doing
[1:35:42] it there was a series of 2 to three inch
[1:35:46] thin metal plates that started at The
[1:35:50] Soldier's belt and were woven all around
[1:35:55] the body like like a piece of of of
[1:35:58] pieace mail or metal then the next piece
[1:36:01] or segment of metal and then the next
[1:36:04] piece or segment of metal would be
[1:36:08] placed side by side or up and down
[1:36:11] coming down this way uh and then where
[1:36:15] one piece left off the next piece would
[1:36:17] begin it would go all the way up from
[1:36:19] his waist to just under his arms
[1:36:23] covering his entire torso what was the
[1:36:26] benefit of that that's where all the
[1:36:28] vital organs are correct these pieces of
[1:36:32] metal plate were
[1:36:33] overlapped sometimes like roofing
[1:36:36] shingles one overlapping the other and
[1:36:40] there was no way to get in between them
[1:36:43] to pierce into them there was another
[1:36:45] series of metal strips that started at
[1:36:49] the upper arm and the strips would cross
[1:36:52] the shoulders went down past the neck
[1:36:56] the same thing on the other side from
[1:36:59] the upper arm over to the neck across
[1:37:02] the chest over the back all the way down
[1:37:05] to the hips these strips of thin metal
[1:37:08] covered the entire upper body so not
[1:37:11] just the front but also the back listen
[1:37:14] God's got it all
[1:37:16] covered under this body armor but over
[1:37:19] the wool tunic that the soldiers wear
[1:37:22] they would also have a leather vest
[1:37:24] usually to sort of protect them from
[1:37:26] getting gouged by the metal because even
[1:37:29] the armor itself was almost dangerous if
[1:37:32] a soldier was moving about so to prevent
[1:37:36] the armor from resting or from uh
[1:37:39] affecting the skin then there would be a
[1:37:42] leather vest
[1:37:44] underneath picture something like a
[1:37:46] modern football shoulder pad not quite
[1:37:50] as bulky not quite as extend end in far
[1:37:54] from the shoulders or from the body but
[1:37:57] covering the same basic parts of the
[1:37:59] shoulders and then another piece woven
[1:38:02] with it covering the belly the back and
[1:38:05] the sides then the breastplate once he
[1:38:08] put on a leather shirt the breastplate
[1:38:10] was put over him all of that armor was
[1:38:13] put over him fastened together the
[1:38:16] bottom of the breastplate was anchored
[1:38:20] guess where to the belt
[1:38:23] why so that in the middle of swinging
[1:38:26] his sword the breastplate didn't begin
[1:38:30] to ride up on his body making him unable
[1:38:35] to engage in battle so all of these
[1:38:38] pieces of metal coming down making this
[1:38:41] overlapping shingle effect and then tied
[1:38:44] off at the belt so that it wouldn't ride
[1:38:47] up I want you to know somebody was an
[1:38:49] engineering
[1:38:51] genius and this is the kind of armor
[1:38:55] that's being described it's the kind of
[1:38:56] armor that Paul would have been most
[1:38:58] familiar with having lived in the second
[1:39:01] temple period I like the fact that the
[1:39:04] breastplate is tied to the belt because
[1:39:07] the belt represents what truth the
[1:39:11] breastplate represents what his
[1:39:14] righteousness in Isaiah 58 and 8 if you
[1:39:18] look at that the word of God tells us
[1:39:22] that our back is not unguarded he said
[1:39:25] then shall thy light Break Forth as the
[1:39:29] morning and thine Health shall spring
[1:39:32] forth speedily and thy
[1:39:36] righteousness shall go before Thee the
[1:39:39] glory of the Lord shall be thy rear
[1:39:46] word you know he goes before us
[1:39:50] preparing the
[1:39:51] way his light is like a lamp to our feet
[1:39:55] as we heard in the song and now the
[1:39:58] scripture said the glory of the Lord
[1:40:01] comes to cover us from the back so if we
[1:40:05] take on the complete Armor of God we are
[1:40:08] well protected against the Ws of the
[1:40:12] enemy but did you notice the scripture
[1:40:14] said you've got to take it you've got to
[1:40:17] put it on there's nobody who can dress
[1:40:20] you in that complete armor your preacher
[1:40:23] can't do it your mama can't do it granny
[1:40:26] can't do it you have to be willing to
[1:40:29] take it to accept it by faith and to put
[1:40:33] it on in your life that Hebrew word uh
[1:40:37] rearward there literally means to gather
[1:40:43] or collect from the rear to bring up the
[1:40:47] rear or to guard from the rear so in the
[1:40:51] New Testament we've got the complete
[1:40:53] armor of the Lord and the Old Testament
[1:40:55] tells us that the glory of the Lord is
[1:40:58] going to come behind us and protect us
[1:41:00] from behind I like that uh of course the
[1:41:04] word Glory that's used there the glory
[1:41:07] of the Lord shall be your rear word that
[1:41:10] is that word cavod in Hebrew and
[1:41:14] remember it doesn't just mean a little
[1:41:16] bit of his presence or just a little bit
[1:41:18] of a feeling or some inspiration or
[1:41:20] sensation it actually means the heav
[1:41:24] that heavy
[1:41:26] weighty costly
[1:41:29] Splendor of his presence someone said to
[1:41:32] me a few months ago brother if we have
[1:41:35] the word why do we need his
[1:41:42] presence because the Bible tells us that
[1:41:45] the letter
[1:41:48] kth you know you can quote all the
[1:41:52] scriptures to the devil you want to but
[1:41:55] he he sees how you live the rest of the
[1:41:57] time you can't fudge on that it's the
[1:42:01] word that has been quickened to us Made
[1:42:03] Alive to us the word that we use to
[1:42:06] defeat the enemy today is not a Written
[1:42:08] Letter it's a Living Word how many of
[1:42:12] you are glad the Living Word is on board
[1:42:14] Jesus the living reality of who he is in
[1:42:18] the life of the believer and yes right
[1:42:22] now having heard the message with the
[1:42:24] seals open and all of the Glorious
[1:42:27] things that God has done for us in this
[1:42:30] hour we still need
[1:42:33] encounters with that heavy weighty
[1:42:36] costly Splendor of his presence somebody
[1:42:40] said he meets me in my car he will he
[1:42:43] meets me at the foot of my bed he will
[1:42:47] but he also wants to meet you when you
[1:42:48] come to his house he wants to meet you
[1:42:51] here if if you're sitting on your hands
[1:42:54] instead of entering in to Worship the
[1:42:56] Lord when you have an opportunity to do
[1:42:58] so you may miss the hour of your
[1:43:00] visitation from the cavod I want to walk
[1:43:03] in such a way that I'm in tune with that
[1:43:06] with that presence because I'm telling
[1:43:08] you I need that that Glory that presence
[1:43:14] I is something that's More Than A
[1:43:16] Feeling and it's more than an emotion it
[1:43:19] stirs up a spiritual hunger in the heart
[1:43:21] of the believer it transforms and
[1:43:24] changes us from where we are into the
[1:43:28] stature of the perfect man Jesus Christ
[1:43:33] and how did the scripture say that
[1:43:35] happens from
[1:43:37] Glory it didn't say from verse to
[1:43:40] verse better hear me it it didn't say
[1:43:43] from quote to
[1:43:45] quote we're transformed from glory to
[1:43:50] glory from Splendor of his presence the
[1:43:53] Splendor of his presence the word is
[1:43:55] already working activated in our life
[1:43:58] and when we come into the presence that
[1:44:00] word becomes living and
[1:44:04] moving someone said we don't live by
[1:44:06] feeling that's exactly right and yet the
[1:44:08] scripture said you'll know you're
[1:44:10] saved because there's a coming
[1:44:13] alive there's a
[1:44:16] quickening that's not a sensation or a
[1:44:19] goosebump that's a moving on the inside
[1:44:22] it's like an internal earthquake has
[1:44:24] anybody ever experienced something like
[1:44:26] that look at 2 Corinthians CH 3: 18 with
[1:44:31] me for just a moment and all of us as
[1:44:35] with unveiled
[1:44:38] face because we continue to behold in
[1:44:43] the word of God as in a mirror the glory
[1:44:48] of the Lord watch this are constantly
[1:44:52] being it's a process it has an in on the
[1:44:56] end of it we are constantly being
[1:45:00] transfigured changed into his very
[1:45:05] own image in EV listen this is good in
[1:45:10] ever increasing
[1:45:13] Splendor and
[1:45:18] from and from one degree of Glory to to
[1:45:23] another it's not enough to say I
[1:45:26] encountered him 30 years ago did you
[1:45:30] encounter him this morning he was here
[1:45:33] he came to meet you here today he came
[1:45:37] to meet you in worship he came to meet
[1:45:40] you in the special
[1:45:42] singing he came to meet you in every
[1:45:44] part of what we're doing here today so
[1:45:47] don't let what you experience yester
[1:45:49] year be all that you need don't let it's
[1:45:52] not not all you need don't let it be
[1:45:54] your only satisfaction we need one
[1:45:57] degree of Glory from another we need to
[1:46:00] come into His anointing every day of our
[1:46:03] life we need to encounter the Splendor
[1:46:06] of his presence as often as we possibly
[1:46:09] can and he is as
[1:46:11] close as the
[1:46:14] mention of his name do you believe that
[1:46:18] in Isaiah
[1:46:20] 588 it says the same as what we just
[1:46:24] read but I want to read it again in in
[1:46:27] the Amplified it said then shall your
[1:46:29] light Break Forth this is the only other
[1:46:31] place in the Old Testament where
[1:46:33] rearward is mentioned then shall your
[1:46:35] light Break Forth like the morning and
[1:46:38] your healing your restoration and the
[1:46:42] power of a new life shall spring
[1:46:46] forth speedily your righteousness your
[1:46:50] rightness your Justice
[1:46:53] and your right relationship with God see
[1:46:56] again it's really the outworking of his
[1:47:01] righteousness that's what makes you
[1:47:02] right is because you've got a hold of
[1:47:05] the one who is Right shall go before you
[1:47:09] conducting you to peace and prosperity
[1:47:13] and the glory of the Lord shall be
[1:47:17] your rear
[1:47:19] guard and the glory of the Lord in 52:12
[1:47:24] Isaiah for he shall not go out with
[1:47:27] haste ye shall not go out with haste nor
[1:47:30] go by flight for the Lord listen the
[1:47:33] Lord will go before you and the god of
[1:47:37] Israel will be your your rear guard the
[1:47:42] glory will come behind you you see it's
[1:47:46] the breastplate of his righteousness is
[1:47:49] what gives us Grace to be able to guard
[1:47:51] our heart
[1:47:53] because if those fiery darts of the
[1:47:55] enemy can find a lodging place in your
[1:48:01] emotion in the church age
[1:48:05] book it says this Ephesians chapter the
[1:48:10] the chapter on the Ephesian Church age
[1:48:12] book the True Church of Jesus Christ the
[1:48:16] bride is likened to pure
[1:48:19] gold here's the key her righteousness
[1:48:25] is his
[1:48:28] righteousness her
[1:48:30] attributes are his own
[1:48:34] glorious attributes we're growing up
[1:48:37] into the stature not of just a perfect
[1:48:40] man but into the stature of the perfect
[1:48:44] man the one who was both God and man the
[1:48:49] fullness of the godhead dwelt in him by
[1:48:53] is that what the scripture said so his
[1:48:57] righteousness hers is his her attributes
[1:49:02] are his her identity is
[1:49:08] found she's lost her
[1:49:11] name she's not wearing a hyphenated name
[1:49:15] she turned loose of her name and she now
[1:49:18] wears his glorious name that's why she
[1:49:21] was baptized in his name that's why she
[1:49:24] didn't settle for titles that's why she
[1:49:27] said I want to be his I want to bear his
[1:49:30] name I want to bear his righteousness I
[1:49:34] want to bear his attributes come on what
[1:49:37] he has what he has she is
[1:49:42] to reflect she's not reflecting Church
[1:49:46] anity Creeds and dogmas of Rome no no no
[1:49:51] she's here to reflect character what he
[1:49:55] has she is
[1:49:58] to manifest she is to manifest let's go
[1:50:02] on there is no
[1:50:10] fault now what do you want to say about
[1:50:12] that you you you're amening that we're
[1:50:15] here to bear his attributes we are here
[1:50:17] to bear his character then don't get
[1:50:20] quiet when he said there is no fault in
[1:50:22] her and the reason for that is she's
[1:50:24] being transformed right amen and and
[1:50:29] when when he became
[1:50:31] sin he paid the
[1:50:34] price not just your past he paid for
[1:50:38] your present and he paid for your future
[1:50:41] is that right there is no fault in her
[1:50:45] she is all
[1:50:47] glorious within and without that's
[1:50:50] because she's reflecting him from
[1:50:53] beginning to ending she is the work of
[1:50:56] her Lord and all his works are perfect
[1:51:01] in fact in her is summed up and
[1:51:05] manifested the Eternal wisdom and
[1:51:08] purpose of God oh Lord let us live today
[1:51:13] to manifest the Eternal wisdom and
[1:51:15] purpose of the great Creator how can one
[1:51:18] fathom it how can one understand it
[1:51:21] though we cannot do it it we can accept
[1:51:26] it even if you can't explain it you can
[1:51:30] see that it is according to the word so
[1:51:33] how do we access the truth of the word
[1:51:36] by faith it's mine I am come on I am I
[1:51:42] am
[1:51:45] healed let the weak
[1:51:47] say I can hardly make it
[1:51:53] I don't ask people anymore how was your
[1:51:58] week because even Believers don't know
[1:52:00] how to
[1:52:01] talk they say it was a week from hell
[1:52:04] how is that possible how is it possible
[1:52:07] for a Believer to receive a week from
[1:52:09] hell you may have
[1:52:12] battled but so did every believer come
[1:52:15] on what you did is you just lived a week
[1:52:19] right out of your destiny
[1:52:21] book it's there there to shape you it's
[1:52:24] there to mold you to God be the glory so
[1:52:28] I just had a Heavenly
[1:52:30] week it was rough there was some things
[1:52:34] that weren't pleasant we can say we had
[1:52:36] some stuff to get over there were some
[1:52:39] hurdles to jump but we're so thankful
[1:52:42] that God is still God honey that's how
[1:52:45] Believers have got to talk he's bringing
[1:52:48] me
[1:52:49] through Jesus is my victory yeah come on
[1:52:53] it changes everything because what's in
[1:52:56] the
[1:52:58] heart if you feel sorry for yourself
[1:53:02] it'll get lodged up in there and your
[1:53:06] life will start
[1:53:07] manifesting that
[1:53:12] need for
[1:53:14] sympathy let me tell you something
[1:53:16] sympathy may be a blessing at times but
[1:53:19] it's not what we need to get over
[1:53:22] sympathy doesn't get us even empathy
[1:53:24] doesn't get us over the only thing that
[1:53:26] gives us Overcomers Victory Is by a
[1:53:30] testimony because we overcome by the
[1:53:32] blood of the Lamb number one and number
[1:53:35] two by the word of what comes out of our
[1:53:37] mouth that's why a heart has to be so
[1:53:41] entirely guarded in Isaiah 59 just a
[1:53:45] little while longer with me if you will
[1:53:48] Isaiah 59:1 16 and he saw that there was
[1:53:52] was no man and wondered that there was
[1:53:55] no intercessor therefore his arm brought
[1:53:59] salvation Yeshua unto him and his
[1:54:04] righteousness it sustained him this is a
[1:54:08] Messianic prophecy right out of the
[1:54:10] inspiration of God through the writing
[1:54:13] of the prophet Isaiah for he put on
[1:54:18] righteousness as a breastplate
[1:54:23] and an helmet of the very name the very
[1:54:27] name of Jesus Yeshua his Hebrew name uh
[1:54:31] the helmet of of Jesus the helmet of
[1:54:35] salvation upon his head and he put on
[1:54:39] the garments of Vengeance for clothing
[1:54:41] this is the Messiah and was clad with a
[1:54:45] Zeal as a cloak so if this is the
[1:54:49] metaphorical language used by the
[1:54:51] prophet to describe the presentation of
[1:54:54] the coming Messiah then isn't it right
[1:54:57] for Paul to say it was his armor what
[1:55:00] you're putting on is not Romans armor
[1:55:03] it's not an armor that just belonged to
[1:55:05] a Roman soldier it's the armor of the
[1:55:07] lord lord today I'm putting on your
[1:55:11] armor I'm putting on the helmet of
[1:55:13] Yeshua the helmet of salvation I'm going
[1:55:17] to put on the breastplate of
[1:55:19] righteousness I'm going to prepare my
[1:55:21] feet with peace yes I'm going to take
[1:55:25] the sword of the spirit I'm going to
[1:55:28] guard my own heart my own garden because
[1:55:32] the enemy is always creeping around
[1:55:35] Desiring to seow his seeds of
[1:55:37] discrepancy you believe that and I like
[1:55:40] What He Wore as a cloak
[1:55:42] Zeal now remember that word zeal in the
[1:55:45] Hebrew is
[1:55:48] Passion it it's passion if you're going
[1:55:51] to do something something for
[1:55:55] God it's not anymore praise the Lord
[1:55:59] anyhow we sung that in the old church
[1:56:02] you know praise the Lord anyhow makes no
[1:56:04] difference what comes my way I'm GNA
[1:56:06] praise the Lord
[1:56:08] anyhow that doesn't sound like
[1:56:10] overcoming to me sounds kind of nice but
[1:56:13] it doesn't sound like an overcomer you
[1:56:15] see I'm not going to praise the Lord
[1:56:16] anyhow and give him any old praise Just
[1:56:19] Praise because I think I'm I want to
[1:56:21] give him what the scripture calls
[1:56:24] High that's Warfare praise that's
[1:56:27] actually what the word tells us it's
[1:56:29] Warfare praise it's praise that pushes
[1:56:32] back the
[1:56:34] shadow Jason sometime when you're
[1:56:36] working on a car and the enemy may come
[1:56:39] in your mind that he might make you
[1:56:41] heavy you've got a way you've got a way
[1:56:44] provided for you to push that Darkness
[1:56:46] back you don't have to get religious you
[1:56:49] don't have to get churchy all you have
[1:56:50] to do is just pray
[1:56:55] just Just Praise Him not anyhow because
[1:57:00] you want to because you're fearfully and
[1:57:03] wonderfully created to praise him it's
[1:57:07] who we are it's not what we do it's an
[1:57:10] expression of who we are here come the
[1:57:14] Lord as the Messiah with a cloak of
[1:57:17] passion with a cloak of zeal if we're
[1:57:19] going to do something for god let's do
[1:57:21] it with everything that that's within us
[1:57:23] I told you how my I'm of course I'm
[1:57:26] thinking about sister Bell so I I'll
[1:57:28] think about my granny she would play the
[1:57:31] guitar for me to sing when I was a boy
[1:57:33] she played the Gibson guitar and uh she
[1:57:38] always wanted to stand over here if I
[1:57:39] stood there she wanted to stand here and
[1:57:42] if I ever got on the wrong side of her
[1:57:44] she'd make me move before I
[1:57:46] sang how many of you remember
[1:57:49] why because if I wasn't given it enough
[1:57:56] she'd used the neck of that
[1:58:00] guitar to bump me pretty hard on the
[1:58:04] back of the head in church in
[1:58:07] Church I'm in the middle of a song and
[1:58:10] Granny's
[1:58:12] guitar neck would hit me in the back of
[1:58:15] the head and I'd look at her like I
[1:58:17] didn't know what it was about but I did
[1:58:19] I'd look at her and she said you going
[1:58:20] to give him praise give him
[1:58:23] everything don't sit up there and sing
[1:58:25] where nobody can hear
[1:58:27] you somebody said you sure are loud when
[1:58:29] you preaching saying it's Granny's
[1:58:32] fault cuz she said if you're going to do
[1:58:34] it you got to do it with a Zeal you got
[1:58:37] to do it with a passion you got to do it
[1:58:39] with all your
[1:58:40] heart let everything that
[1:58:44] has praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:58:49] praise the Lord amen
[1:58:53] I thank God he said it goes on according
[1:58:55] to their deeds accordingly he will repay
[1:58:58] Fury to his adversaries recompense to
[1:59:01] his enemies to the islands he will pay
[1:59:04] recompense I wanted to stop in this but
[1:59:07] but I had to put some more verses here
[1:59:08] because it gets really good as you read
[1:59:10] so shall they fear the name of the Lord
[1:59:13] from the West and his glory before the
[1:59:17] rising of the sun when the enemy shall
[1:59:21] come in like a
[1:59:22] flood the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[1:59:35] up you know we have so many
[1:59:40] critics they they even criticize because
[1:59:43] we have meals during camp meeting after
[1:59:45] the service you know people have so much
[1:59:47] to say about these poor sisters who have
[1:59:49] to to make a meal for these visitors who
[1:59:52] come in we we we get criticized because
[1:59:55] you may look around sometime and see
[1:59:56] sister Megan or sister J or somebody
[1:59:59] raising a little flag or waving a little
[2:00:02] something to the Lord and they say well
[2:00:04] you know brother brandom didn't do that
[2:00:05] in the Tabernacle you're not in the
[2:00:06] Tabernacle that's right you're in a
[2:00:09] sovereign church every church is
[2:00:12] Sovereign you're not going to come in
[2:00:14] here and tell me how to praise the Lord
[2:00:16] I'm going to praise Him according to the
[2:00:18] dictates of my heart I'm going to take a
[2:00:21] junior Jackson pass on that because he
[2:00:24] said I know that's how they do it at the
[2:00:25] Tabernacle but he said I want to do a
[2:00:27] little different over here and brother
[2:00:29] bam said leave them alone folks ought to
[2:00:31] just leave you alone when you want to
[2:00:33] praise him why did you bring up that
[2:00:35] because what do you think a standard
[2:00:42] is it's a war
[2:00:45] flag and when the enemy sees that
[2:00:48] standard and of course we can go a lot
[2:00:50] of places with that stand
[2:00:52] we can talk about
[2:00:54] Holiness cuz we need a little more of
[2:00:56] that in the
[2:00:58] body I see brothers that need to visit
[2:01:00] the barber shop a little more often and
[2:01:03] and and sisters who could use a little
[2:01:05] little length in their skirt and we can
[2:01:08] talk about that that's also a standard
[2:01:11] don't get quiet it's still the truth but
[2:01:15] the standard here is not talking about a
[2:01:18] Holiness standard it's talking about a
[2:01:20] war flag when the enemy wo comes in like
[2:01:25] a flood the Lord will lift up a war flag
[2:01:31] against
[2:01:34] him somebody said what if I don't have a
[2:01:37] war flag you
[2:01:39] do I would that men everywhere would
[2:01:42] lift up holy hands without wrath and
[2:01:46] without
[2:01:49] doubt somebody said I don't understand
[2:01:52] why you know I just like to do that do
[2:01:54] that if that's all you can do do
[2:01:57] it some people are stove up and that's
[2:01:59] the best they can get but I want you to
[2:02:02] know when I come to praise him I want to
[2:02:05] praise him I want to do my if I can get
[2:02:07] it up there as long as I can get it up I
[2:02:09] may not be able to reach very far behind
[2:02:13] me but if I can get it up I want to get
[2:02:16] it up because sometimes that's my war
[2:02:18] flag and when the enemy sees a Believer
[2:02:21] going going through the fire going
[2:02:23] through a trial going through joint pain
[2:02:27] going through whatever sickness you're
[2:02:29] dealing with and yet you've got your war
[2:02:31] flag up and you're saying my God is good
[2:02:36] he's good he's faithful he's going to
[2:02:40] always take care of
[2:02:47] me it it causes the enemy to pull back
[2:02:52] he's the one that's destined to
[2:02:54] retreat you're not to be
[2:02:57] intimidated you're to push him back and
[2:03:00] you can do that with a war flag you can
[2:03:03] do that with a standard well didn't it
[2:03:05] say The Spirit of the Lord shall do it
[2:03:08] it didn't say you'd do it it'd say the
[2:03:09] spirit of the Lord should do it what do
[2:03:11] you think brought me here this morning
[2:03:13] why do you think I'm here I'm here by
[2:03:16] the grace of God I'm here because the
[2:03:19] spirit of the Lord strengthened me to
[2:03:21] get here
[2:03:22] he gave me the want to he gave me the
[2:03:25] desire when I got up this morning I got
[2:03:28] up to praise him I didn't wait till I
[2:03:31] got here to give him glory I gave him
[2:03:33] glory before I rolled out of bed at 6:45
[2:03:37] I gave him glory when I started going
[2:03:39] toward the shower when I come out I was
[2:03:42] still thanking God for what he was going
[2:03:44] to do for us if we get in that
[2:03:48] atmosphere now of course you understand
[2:03:51] that uh there's lots of commas in
[2:03:55] English but there were none in
[2:03:59] Hebrew there were there were some breath
[2:04:02] breath
[2:04:03] marks to help people know when to take a
[2:04:06] breath but there weren't really
[2:04:09] Commons so this translation could really
[2:04:12] go either way this is right out of King
[2:04:15] James it says when the enemy shall come
[2:04:18] in like a flood and somebody somewhere
[2:04:21] said this this is going into English
[2:04:24] this is a good place to put the comma so
[2:04:26] people can get a breath while they're
[2:04:29] reading because that's all it was in
[2:04:31] Hebrew a breath Mark but in English it
[2:04:35] sometimes
[2:04:37] separates the meaning of a
[2:04:40] subject and when a comma comes it can
[2:04:44] change a comma oh my
[2:04:47] goodness you you've seen that little
[2:04:49] meme that that talks about if you put
[2:04:51] the Comm in the wrong place you're
[2:04:52] eating
[2:04:54] Grandma instead of eating what grandma
[2:04:57] made so you got to be careful with that
[2:05:00] comma well this could really literally
[2:05:03] read either way and I I read it both
[2:05:05] ways it's good both ways some people
[2:05:09] only read it when the enemy comes in
[2:05:10] like a flood
[2:05:12] comma the spirit of the Lord shall lift
[2:05:15] up a standard against him and that's all
[2:05:18] that's right that's English it's fairly
[2:05:20] translated it's okay to do that but it
[2:05:24] could just as equally read I'm I'm going
[2:05:26] I'm back to the it could just equally
[2:05:29] read when the enemy shall come in yes
[2:05:36] sir come
[2:05:39] on lack a
[2:05:42] flood the spirit of the
[2:05:46] Lord shall lift up a
[2:05:49] standard against him now the reality is
[2:05:53] the enemy will come in like a flood but
[2:05:57] the greater reality is when he
[2:06:02] does so will the
[2:06:05] Lord if you don't believe that then you
[2:06:08] miss the scripture that says the Lord
[2:06:11] sth on top of the flood he rides it like
[2:06:16] a horse to come to your rescue when you
[2:06:20] call on him
[2:06:22] you may feel forsaken you may feel
[2:06:25] forgotten you may feel rejected you may
[2:06:29] feel overlooked but it's a lie your God
[2:06:33] hasn't misplaced you he knows exactly
[2:06:37] where you are get your war flag up Let
[2:06:42] Your Standard be raised against the
[2:06:44] enemy and he has no choice but to do
[2:06:47] what he has to flee from you okay I'll
[2:06:51] leave the translation alone but it sure
[2:06:54] makes a
[2:06:55] difference I've seen the enemy come in
[2:06:57] like a flood but I've also watched the
[2:07:01] Lord I've watched him ride in
[2:07:05] woo seemingly out of
[2:07:08] nowhere and suddenly change everything
[2:07:12] woo I'm thankful I'm so thankful for
[2:07:15] every time now we know that the uh I'm
[2:07:19] not going to finish reading all all of
[2:07:22] this uh but I will I will read verse 21
[2:07:27] as for me this is my Covenant with them
[2:07:31] saith the Lord that's him he signed this
[2:07:36] my spirit that is upon thee and my words
[2:07:40] which I have put in thy mouth shall not
[2:07:43] depart out of thy mouth nor out of the
[2:07:46] mouth of thy seed nor out of the mouth
[2:07:49] of thy seed's seed saith the Lord from
[2:07:53] henceforth and
[2:07:55] forever I I don't think you ought to
[2:07:57] miss that it's a promise with a covenant
[2:08:02] attached and it says if you'll hold on
[2:08:05] to
[2:08:06] me I'm going to hold on to you I'm going
[2:08:10] to put some victory in your talk cuz you
[2:08:13] need some victory in your talk so that
[2:08:16] you can get it moved down to your walk
[2:08:18] and I'm not only going to do it for you
[2:08:20] but I'm going to do it for your seed
[2:08:22] your children and I'm going to do it for
[2:08:24] your children's children anybody want to
[2:08:27] believe God for the Deliverance of their
[2:08:29] family anybody want to sing A Chorus of
[2:08:31] it's already done my family is sealed
[2:08:35] It's Already Done claiming every one of
[2:08:39] them now that breastplate of
[2:08:41] righteousness is a
[2:08:44] metaphor for the protection of the heart
[2:08:48] which is the seed of the emotions and
[2:08:50] affection
[2:08:52] there's a lot of things can live in that
[2:08:55] Garden did you know love can live
[2:08:59] there but so can
[2:09:05] lust you want to cultivate the
[2:09:09] love you want to dig out the
[2:09:11] lust it won't leave on its
[2:09:14] own it'll never leave on its own it's
[2:09:18] connected even to the chemistry of your
[2:09:20] body it won't leave on it own you'll
[2:09:22] have to cut it out by the root you'll
[2:09:25] have to dig it out with a grub hole come
[2:09:28] on you'll have to take God's word to it
[2:09:31] until you have utterly destroyed its
[2:09:33] ability to flourish in your
[2:09:36] life God gives us the grace to do that
[2:09:39] so we're watching carefully over our
[2:09:41] heart that breastplate of righteousness
[2:09:44] protects the core of a person's
[2:09:47] spiritual life it is a supernatural
[2:09:50] armor that Ena Christians to stand
[2:09:53] against the devil's schemes and to fight
[2:09:55] against the forces of Darkness that
[2:09:58] spiritually invade your body your mind
[2:10:02] as a Believer a battle involves two
[2:10:05] Waring armies or personas or factions
[2:10:09] engaged in a struggle a controversy or a
[2:10:13] contest similarly as Christians we're
[2:10:16] faced with daily spiritual warfare this
[2:10:20] this means our enemy is known in the
[2:10:22] Physical Realm but instead of actively
[2:10:25] attacking in the Physical Realm he often
[2:10:28] Works through the spiritual realm
[2:10:31] breaking forth into the physical
[2:10:33] therefore we can't always see him he's
[2:10:35] like the wind we can't always see him
[2:10:39] but we can see the effect of where he's
[2:10:41] been where he's moving God gives us the
[2:10:44] ability to do that and that might sound
[2:10:47] scary to some believers who don't even
[2:10:49] believe that there is still a Warfare
[2:10:51] going on it may leave you wondering if
[2:10:54] there's a way out of this but I want you
[2:10:56] to know everything you need to whip the
[2:10:59] devil everything you need to defeat the
[2:11:01] enemy is in Your Arsenal yes if you
[2:11:04] won't leave it there
[2:11:05] untouched in the message the greatest
[2:11:08] battle ever fought and we're winding
[2:11:10] down paragraph
[2:11:13] 400 it says see his attack watch listen
[2:11:19] close this closing his attack is what
[2:11:24] disbelief God's word that's why he
[2:11:27] comes he he he doesn't come just to take
[2:11:30] your joy he comes to cause you not to
[2:11:34] believe that God is always good I want
[2:11:38] everybody to know we said this last week
[2:11:40] but I want everybody to know God is
[2:11:42] always good he's always good when things
[2:11:47] happen that aren't good God is still
[2:11:50] always always good you've got to
[2:11:53] remember that because that's how the
[2:11:55] enemy moved in against Eve he convinced
[2:11:58] her that God did not have her total good
[2:12:04] in his heart that he was holding
[2:12:07] something back for himself and therefore
[2:12:11] was looking at his
[2:12:13] creation uh in in in a different kind of
[2:12:16] light and and that he would be exalted
[2:12:20] and and that mankind would continually
[2:12:23] be put down but how many of you know
[2:12:25] that's just a dirty lie he came to raise
[2:12:28] them up that's right he came to raise
[2:12:31] Adam and Eve up he came to raise this
[2:12:33] generation up into his presence not put
[2:12:36] them down but if God can get you to
[2:12:38] doubt that he is if the enemy rather can
[2:12:41] get you to doubt that God is good he's
[2:12:43] already got a foot in the door you're
[2:12:46] already in trouble brother Brandon goes
[2:12:49] on to say there can you see the the
[2:12:51] greatest battle was ever fought there's
[2:12:54] only two forces Satan and God and what
[2:12:58] is Satan's weapon against you it is
[2:13:02] watch this carefully you know this it is
[2:13:04] to try to get you to
[2:13:08] disbelieve your
[2:13:11] weapon what is Satan's greatest weapon
[2:13:14] against you to try to get you to
[2:13:17] disbelieve your
[2:13:19] weapon and your weapon is God's
[2:13:23] word and if he can do that he disarms
[2:13:28] you he said if he can get you to
[2:13:31] disbelief your weapon is equivalent if
[2:13:35] he gets you to believe that your weapon
[2:13:37] is not strong enough he
[2:13:41] has disarmed you
[2:13:44] 402 look he's disarmed you when he gets
[2:13:49] you to disbelieve the weapon
[2:13:52] when you lay that down the word when you
[2:13:55] lay that down
[2:13:58] that
[2:14:00] finishes your fight you're
[2:14:03] done if you lay down the sword of the
[2:14:08] spirit the word of God you've lost that
[2:14:13] battle it's all you have it is
[2:14:19] written and it wasn't the letter only
[2:14:22] that Jesus used to overcome oh no it was
[2:14:26] the Living Word declaring the word and
[2:14:31] that's what God wants to be in you he
[2:14:33] wants to fill you with who he is the
[2:14:36] Living Word so that when you take up
[2:14:39] that written record of his word and you
[2:14:41] speak it to your enemy to your Mountain
[2:14:45] to your circumstance to your situation
[2:14:49] it's not just a d
[2:14:51] sentence now because the Living Word is
[2:14:55] inspiring it it's
[2:14:59] alive the enemy has no
[2:15:02] choice he can play around with your
[2:15:05] written quote or your written
[2:15:08] verse he can he can talk to you over
[2:15:10] that and try to get you to well that
[2:15:12] don't apply to you that's all right but
[2:15:14] it don't apply to you but you put that
[2:15:17] written word the written record of his
[2:15:19] word the Bible that
[2:15:21] absolute you put that in the hands of
[2:15:24] someone who's filled with the Living
[2:15:28] Word you see this isn't the third part
[2:15:31] of the Trinity that's living inside of
[2:15:34] you this Holy Ghost is much more than
[2:15:39] that that's the same God that Holy Ghost
[2:15:44] in you is the same God that said let
[2:15:47] there be
[2:15:48] light and there was light
[2:15:51] you see he didn't need to exercise so
[2:15:54] much power because he was
[2:15:57] Authority and while the church
[2:15:59] constantly prays for more power it's not
[2:16:03] more power that we
[2:16:04] need it's more Authority we need to
[2:16:08] recognize the authority that is already
[2:16:11] ours because when you wake up to your
[2:16:14] potential Authority and you start using
[2:16:17] the power of that word with the
[2:16:20] authority of of the one who spoke it it
[2:16:23] is
[2:16:26] written thus says the
[2:16:29] word he has no choice but to respond to
[2:16:33] that because that's not the third piece
[2:16:36] of God that's who God is he didn't want
[2:16:40] to just be Emmanuel God With Us he
[2:16:43] wanted to be holy ghost he wanted to be
[2:16:46] God in us same
[2:16:49] Jesus this same name Jesus that you see
[2:16:52] leaving he's coming again and he is one
[2:16:55] of these days to receive his bride but
[2:16:58] how many of you know he came on the day
[2:16:59] of Pentecost this is
[2:17:02] that in fact Jesus tried to tell them he
[2:17:06] tried to tell them all about it if they
[2:17:08] could have only had ears to hear aren't
[2:17:10] you glad that God has given you some
[2:17:12] some ears to hear and some I have and
[2:17:16] you know who this is living inside of
[2:17:18] you the Living Word lives in The
[2:17:19] Believer
[2:17:21] if he can get you to disbelieve your
[2:17:23] weapon he disarms you he goes on when
[2:17:26] you lay that down that finishes your
[2:17:27] fight you're done hold that weapon don't
[2:17:29] lay it
[2:17:31] down you've got to hold on to that and
[2:17:34] then in the message Junction of time
[2:17:37] this one made me
[2:17:40] jump I jumped when I read
[2:17:44] it and now notice again that not only
[2:17:49] that when all hell turns
[2:17:54] loose when the enemy comes in like a
[2:18:00] flood like a flood the spirit of the
[2:18:03] Lord will raise up a standard hear what
[2:18:05] he said when all hell turns loose all
[2:18:09] Heaven turns loose
[2:18:13] also so which are you going to testify
[2:18:17] about I'm going to testify that all of
[2:18:19] Heaven is turning loose on my behalf we
[2:18:23] already know the devil's after us we
[2:18:25] need to be reminded that God is already
[2:18:28] loosing what we need he said when the
[2:18:31] enemy comes in like a flood the spirit
[2:18:34] of God raises up a standard against it
[2:18:36] and these two
[2:18:39] forces
[2:18:40] always
[2:18:42] showed they always manifested at the
[2:18:46] junction right did you all understand
[2:18:49] that we we've come to the to the last
[2:18:53] Junction it's bride
[2:18:56] time it's time for this little body of
[2:18:59] manifested sons to get up and do what
[2:19:03] God has called us to
[2:19:05] do and there's a lot that got to happen
[2:19:07] in us for that to happen and the first
[2:19:09] thing we got to quit making so many
[2:19:12] excuses we've got to quit talking about
[2:19:15] all hell turning and loose against us
[2:19:17] and we've got to start focusing a little
[2:19:19] more on the fact that every everything
[2:19:21] we need to make this
[2:19:24] Rapture has already been released in us
[2:19:28] not to US in US it is here and we've got
[2:19:32] to put our Focus there while guarding
[2:19:35] our heart against all other unbelief if
[2:19:38] you believe that maybe you'd say amen
[2:19:41] amen and here is one verse in closing 1
[2:19:45] Peter 5 8 and N I'm sorry again it's in
[2:19:49] the it's in the louder
[2:19:53] version be well balanced
[2:19:57] uhoh brother brandom said to brother
[2:19:59] green brother Perry whatever you
[2:20:02] [Music]
[2:20:05] do keep your
[2:20:09] balance in the
[2:20:13] scriptures there has to
[2:20:15] be an absolute
[2:20:19] Foundation all
[2:20:21] Doctrine all Visions all dreams all
[2:20:25] spiritual gifts even
[2:20:27] feelings everything has to come and set
[2:20:31] down on the on the foundation of
[2:20:33] scripture the absolute of scripture if
[2:20:36] it doesn't line up I don't care how good
[2:20:38] it felt if it doesn't line up with the
[2:20:41] word you've got to reject it we've got
[2:20:45] to be balanced in our Doctrine we've got
[2:20:48] to be balanced in our emotion
[2:20:52] we can't let our emotions lead us we've
[2:20:56] got to have authority over
[2:20:58] them your mind will try to lead
[2:21:02] you your will will try to lead you away
[2:21:06] from the plan of God for your life your
[2:21:09] emotions will try to lead you away from
[2:21:11] the absolutes of scripture but if you'll
[2:21:14] be well-balanced
[2:21:16] temperate sober of mind
[2:21:21] God doesn't mind you having a sense
[2:21:23] having a sense of humor but there's just
[2:21:25] some things you don't clown around
[2:21:29] with this is a pretty serious hour we're
[2:21:32] in it's all right to enjoy life it's all
[2:21:35] right to say something funny I hope
[2:21:38] because without humor life can get
[2:21:40] pretty dry in don't you feel sorry for
[2:21:43] people that look sour every time you see
[2:21:47] them maybe some people got more than
[2:21:49] you've got
[2:21:51] but they're still
[2:21:53] sour that's not how the believer is
[2:21:55] going to get through this thing a merry
[2:21:58] heart doeth good like a medicine if you
[2:22:00] let your spirit always be if you let
[2:22:03] your spirit always be
[2:22:05] broken it affects your
[2:22:08] health it dries your bones the scripture
[2:22:11] said it makes you brittle against the
[2:22:13] obstacles of life okay be vigilant
[2:22:17] temperate sober of Mind Vigilant
[2:22:20] cautious
[2:22:21] at all times for that enemy of yours the
[2:22:24] Devil roams around like a lion roaring
[2:22:27] in Fierce hunger he doesn't want to just
[2:22:30] roar against you he wants to devour you
[2:22:33] seeking someone to seize upon and
[2:22:38] devour somebody said oh that makes me
[2:22:41] afraid read on
[2:22:45] withstand him you don't run from the
[2:22:49] Roar
[2:22:50] you run toward the Roar the word said
[2:22:54] withstand him be firm in faith against
[2:22:58] his onset rooted established strong
[2:23:01] immovable and
[2:23:05] determined remember the old hymn I shall
[2:23:08] not be
[2:23:09] moved some people have taken that
[2:23:13] religiously and they think that it kind
[2:23:16] of means like we have to do church today
[2:23:18] like it was done in another
[2:23:22] generation I want you to know that Fanny
[2:23:25] Crosby wasn't the last anointed
[2:23:30] psalmist I love her songs I sing them in
[2:23:34] my life I love the old hymns I grew up
[2:23:38] on the old hymns but sometimes people
[2:23:41] think that we're paying
[2:23:43] homage by by conducting everything that
[2:23:46] we do like it was done then and I want
[2:23:49] you to know that sometimes even our
[2:23:53] Traditions can make the word of God
[2:23:56] ineffective in our life and I think you
[2:23:59] know me enough to know what my balance
[2:24:01] is in that I believe in separate
[2:24:06] living I believe men ought to look like
[2:24:08] men dress like men behave like men and
[2:24:12] women ought to dress like women like
[2:24:14] ladies come on I'm not talking about
[2:24:17] those
[2:24:18] Traditions I'm talking about being so
[2:24:26] stuck that we think the church ought to
[2:24:28] smell as musty
[2:24:31] today as it did
[2:24:33] then that's not the way this works this
[2:24:37] truth didn't
[2:24:39] stop truth is moving marching forward
[2:24:44] bringing us with it it's not a new
[2:24:48] message I'm talking about it's a new
[2:24:52] application it's a generation that says
[2:24:55] I'm not just going to quote it I'm going
[2:24:58] to be
[2:25:00] it I'm going to let it change
[2:25:04] me I'm not just going to say brother
[2:25:07] brandom said my pastor said brother
[2:25:10] green said but I'm going to come to a
[2:25:13] place where I so living and so alive in
[2:25:18] me that I take take the same Authority
[2:25:22] you foul Spirit move out in the name of
[2:25:26] Jesus Christ and how many of you know
[2:25:29] the devil has to go he absolutely has to
[2:25:32] go withstand him be firm in faith
[2:25:35] against his onset musicians coming
[2:25:37] rooted
[2:25:39] established strong immovable and
[2:25:42] determined knowing that the same
[2:25:45] identical sufferings are appointed to
[2:25:48] your Brotherhood the whole body of
[2:25:50] Christians throughout the world can I
[2:25:54] paraphrase that for you you ain't the
[2:25:57] only one going through something
[2:26:02] honey if we took a
[2:26:05] poll if we had a vote how many of you
[2:26:09] going through something everybody in
[2:26:12] here is going through something but but
[2:26:15] the relative term in all of that is
[2:26:17] you're going through it
[2:26:23] you're not trying to get around it
[2:26:26] you're not trying to dig under it you're
[2:26:28] not even always trying to climb over it
[2:26:31] you realize that sometimes the only
[2:26:32] Victory you have is to push your way
[2:26:35] right through by the blood of the lamb
[2:26:38] and the word of God's God's word in your
[2:26:40] mouth in your
[2:26:42] life in in the
[2:26:44] message law uh or Grace
[2:26:51] he said 'I tell you it ought to make
[2:26:53] every Christian buckle up the armor
[2:26:55] that's paragraph
[2:26:57] 61 it ought to make every Christian when
[2:27:00] you see what folks are going through
[2:27:01] when you see what you're going through
[2:27:03] in your own life it ought to make every
[2:27:04] one of us want to take on that armor
[2:27:06] every day Buckle it on he said over
[2:27:09] there it said put on the full armor of
[2:27:11] God and be sure to bring the breastplate
[2:27:14] and the helmet and the shield and all
[2:27:17] those things Paul likened it to a
[2:27:20] Soldier go into battle and when the
[2:27:22] Wilds of the enemy come in and they
[2:27:27] have and they
[2:27:30] will and when the Wilds of the enemy
[2:27:34] comes in throw up your
[2:27:36] Shield don't turn and run don't tuck
[2:27:40] tail and see who you can hide behind
[2:27:43] throw up your Shield go on
[2:27:47] out and meet the challeng
[2:27:51] how can you do that because you've got
[2:27:53] the
[2:27:54] armor you've got everything you need one
[2:27:58] more Redemption by power paragraph 80
[2:28:00] and every man that's born of the spirit
[2:28:03] of God comes into Christ has everlasting
[2:28:08] life you've got more than everlasting
[2:28:12] life you've got Zoe life which is not
[2:28:15] everlasting life it is eternal life
[2:28:20] did you know if we carefully look at the
[2:28:22] word Everlasting in the Bible we find
[2:28:25] that it's not necessarily
[2:28:29] Eternal but you don't just have life
[2:28:32] Everlasting you've got the fullest
[2:28:34] degree of Life the one that is eternal
[2:28:37] the Zoey life of God and when you come
[2:28:40] into that you put on his shield
[2:28:46] his his breastplate
[2:28:51] standing
[2:28:52] ready and forbidden to leave until
[2:28:56] orders to
[2:28:57] March now you can say that's the
[2:29:01] soldiers armor or you can say what Paul
[2:29:06] said put on take on the
[2:29:10] armor of God the one that he wore as
[2:29:14] Messiah when he came and in that you'll
[2:29:17] be able to stand against every while of
[2:29:21] the enemy let's stand father give us
[2:29:24] Grace
[2:29:27] today as Nathan
[2:29:30] prayed to search through our hearts with
[2:29:34] you to let you find the
[2:29:38] spots that need the most
[2:29:41] attention if there's a root of
[2:29:43] bitterness growing show
[2:29:46] us because we don't want bitterness to
[2:29:50] be something flowing out as an issue
[2:29:53] from our
[2:29:55] life if
[2:29:57] Envy has began to grow show us
[2:30:02] Lord how to take the root how to take it
[2:30:06] at the root so that it can never spring
[2:30:10] forth
[2:30:11] again if I am spending my life
[2:30:14] comparing my life my existence to
[2:30:18] somebody else's envy and jealousy is
[2:30:20] bound to grow show me Lord
[2:30:25] how to get it out and then to
[2:30:30] see a guard set over my heart that it
[2:30:36] would never grow
[2:30:38] again love through us
[2:30:41] Jesus there are those who are easy to
[2:30:45] love and there are those who strain us
[2:30:50] but your love is
[2:30:52] so powerful and so
[2:30:57] transformative that we don't want to
[2:30:59] just love with the fileo
[2:31:02] love we want to love with
[2:31:05] Agape we want agapo love to be our
[2:31:08] theme we want it to move through us and
[2:31:13] shine out of us for the glory of God
[2:31:17] would you just lift your hand to him
[2:31:18] right where you are and and say Lord
[2:31:21] this is my
[2:31:23] desire I want to put on the armor of God

[2:31:30] Ws of the devil I want to be on the
[2:31:32] Watchtower of my own heart the seat of
[2:31:36] my emotions I don't want anything
[2:31:38] growing there that is unlike you so we

[2:45:52] natural this
[2:45:54] morning we've come to look at it from
[2:45:56] your word through the lens of truth and
[2:46:01] reality we ask you right now as you
[2:46:04] search this house to minister as only
[2:46:08] you can to the need if you have a need
[2:46:11] and you'd acknowledge it just by lifting
[2:46:13] your hand right now
[2:46:15] Lord It's not the hand you're looking
[2:46:18] for it's the heart underneath that hand
[2:46:21] you see the
[2:46:24] faith that's attached to that
[2:46:28] hand and that faith is saying I believe
[2:46:31] I believe I
[2:46:33] believe that you are the same yesterday
[2:46:37] today and
[2:46:38] forever and that you God are more than
[2:46:43] enough to manifest healing in my body
[2:46:47] leadership in my my
[2:46:50] life victory over
[2:46:54] circumstance you see the heaviness of
[2:46:58] depression that tries to settle over the
[2:47:01] believer in this late hour but I'm
[2:47:03] asking you to come as only you can and
[2:47:06] give us the garments of
[2:47:09] praise for the spirit of heaviness we
[2:47:12] resist heaviness in The Believer right
[2:47:15] now in the name of Jesus we push that
[2:47:20] heaviness back and we say you are not of
[2:47:24] God we will not settle for the heaviness
[2:47:28] of a burden when you have come in the
[2:47:31] heaviness and weightiness of your glory
[2:47:33] yes we don't want to be weighted down
[2:47:36] with
[2:47:38] worry if we choose to be weighted it's
[2:47:41] by your presence it's by Your glory come
[2:47:44] and arrest us for this
[2:47:47] hour
[2:47:50] woo let the Lord just touch you as an
[2:47:53] individual I don't care if you if you
[2:47:56] make any noise I don't care it's not
[2:47:59] about anything like that if you'll just
[2:48:02] open your heart right now I believe his
[2:48:04] presence is here to help you get over
[2:48:09] something and if he doesn't take you
[2:48:11] over the top I know for sure he'll take
[2:48:14] you
[2:48:15] through if you're standing near enough
[2:48:18] to a believer and you feel comfortable
[2:48:19] doing so would you just put your hand on
[2:48:23] on the shoulder brother to brother
[2:48:25] sister to
[2:48:28] sister cuz sometimes we don't get our
[2:48:30] need met until we pray for somebody else
[2:48:34] would you just pray for somebody else
[2:48:36] right now
[2:48:37] father before we go here today we are
[2:48:40] joining our faith
[2:48:44] together believing that you're The God
[2:48:46] Who is more than enough
[2:48:50] you see the weak brother you see the
[2:48:52] weak sister you see the one that's been
[2:48:57] battered physically tired and has made
[2:49:00] them emotionally vulnerable but today we
[2:49:05] believe that your strength is made
[2:49:09] perfect in our
[2:49:13] weakness we sang as little children I am
[2:49:17] weak
[2:49:19] but he is
[2:49:21] strong Lord we stand before you seasoned
[2:49:24] Believers most of
[2:49:26] us and yet sometimes we feel like little
[2:49:29] children singing again I am weak but he
[2:49:34] is strong King Jesus
[2:49:37] come King Jesus come right now and be
[2:49:43] strong where my weakness is where my
[2:49:47] weariness is
[2:49:49] come and Rule and reign as Lord of all
[2:49:53] and show yourself as mighty and able to
[2:50:06] deliver in my

[2:51:20] the spirit and we say Lord we're taking
[2:51:24] the weapon yes and in every area of our
[2:51:27] life where the enemy has tried to cause
[2:51:30] us to doubt our weapon in every place
