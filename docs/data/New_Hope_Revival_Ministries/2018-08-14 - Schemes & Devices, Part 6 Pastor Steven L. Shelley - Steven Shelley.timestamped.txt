[1:13] such a blessing to us we come to you
[1:16] today in partnership with the gospel
[1:18] channel and we want to say again what a
[1:21] great honor and a great privilege it is
[1:23] to be associated with those fine
[1:26] brothers and sisters at the gospel
[1:28] channel it always amazes me that God is
[1:31] using such a small island the island of
[1:34] Iceland and what a mighty effect it's
[1:38] having on the world through the gospel
[1:41] Channel you see there's a number of
[1:43] countries where the gospel channel is
[1:45] reaching out with three different
[1:48] channels forming a powerful network
[1:50] across Iceland across Scandinavia and
[1:54] across Europe we're believing that the
[1:57] Lord is going to make a way to expand
[1:59] that through satellite television into
[2:02] many other nations of the world but
[2:04] we're talking a great number of nations
[2:07] that are already able to pick up the
[2:10] gospel channel on their satellite or on
[2:14] their cable box what a blessing it is
[2:17] but you can also visit you can tell your
[2:20] friends and neighbors who may live a
[2:22] little bit beyond our reach of broadcast
[2:26] you can tell them that they can access
[2:29] the programming of the gospel channel on
[2:31] its website what a beautiful website the
[2:35] gospel channel has and you can access
[2:38] through live streaming you can watch on
[2:42] your computer anywhere in the world and
[2:44] see exactly what others are watching on
[2:48] their television we're thankful for that
[2:50] we believe it's another way that the

[3:46] about the many different ways that God
[3:48] is giving us to reach out with the
[3:50] gospel thank you for your prayer
[3:52] requests your phone calls your emails
[3:55] and I want to encourage you to keep it
[3:57] up because we want to pray with you
[3:59] we're partners with you in prayer we
[4:02] believe that God according to the
[4:05] promise of his word desires that we come
[4:08] before him laying our petitions making
[4:11] them known and then standing on the
[4:13] promises of God in faith and watching
[4:16] him work miracles with men things are
[4:20] impossible but with God all things are
[4:24] possible
[4:25] let's get today to the Word of God and
[4:28] to part six in a series of programs
[4:31] schemes and devices we are studying this
[4:36] together because of the scripture that I
[4:39] like to read at the beginning of the of
[4:41] the word portion of our program 2nd
[4:44] corinthians 2:11 lest Satan should get
[4:48] an advantage of us for we are not
[4:51] ignorant of his devices based on your
[4:55] comments in your phone calls and in your
[4:58] emails this particular series has been a
[5:01] special blessing to you because I
[5:04] believe what God is allowing us to do is
[5:07] help you to identify some of the ways
[5:10] that the enemy is targeting you in your
[5:13] life I also pray that you're able to
[5:16] identify and to pick up some scriptural
[5:20] tips and learning how to use
[5:22] weapons that God has given us against
[5:24] our enemy so that you're able to stop
[5:27] the enemy in his tracks I'm for God's
[5:31] people I truly believe that the Word of
[5:35] God is right and that it works I don't
[5:38] believe that the Lord wants us to be
[5:40] living in defeat in agony all the time
[5:45] I believe he's giving us a way out
[5:47] through his word he wants us to walk in
[5:50] victory in abundant life no matter what
[5:54] the thief is trying to accomplish in us
[5:57] or through us I truly believe that God's
[6:01] Word has the answers for us in ours in
[6:05] times such as the one we're living in
[6:08] right now at the end of our program
[6:11] together the last time we closed with
[6:15] the scripture Ephesians 4:27 neither
[6:18] give place to the devil in that program
[6:23] we talked about a three-fold strategy
[6:25] for bringing down strongholds in our
[6:29] life those thoughts structures that the
[6:32] enemy likes to build around us so that
[6:36] he can keep using the same method the
[6:39] same trick against us over and over
[6:42] again and in that threefold strategy we
[6:45] found in 2nd Corinthians chapter 10
[6:48] verse 5 where we are encouraged to cast
[6:51] down imaginations and everything every
[6:55] lofty thought that exalts itself against
[6:59] the knowledge of Jesus Christ number one
[7:01] then number two to bring into captivity
[7:05] every thought we can bring that thought
[7:08] captive we can corral those thoughts
[7:11] together and then force them to be
[7:14] obedient to what God's Word has said
[7:17] this is the absolute truth not the voice
[7:20] in your head not what naysayers are
[7:23] saying about you or against you this is
[7:26] the ultimate truth of who you are those
[7:29] thoughts are not just going to bow to
[7:31] the truth of God's Word you're going to
[7:33] have to
[7:34] around them you're going to have to take
[7:36] authority over them and gather them up
[7:39] and force them to be submitted to the
[7:43] truth of God's Word and then the third
[7:45] part of that strategy was we've got to
[7:48] learn to be obedient to God's Word to
[7:50] live a life of surrender to him so that
[7:54] he can lead us and direct us you know
[7:57] for some people it's a strange thought
[7:59] that a foreign thought that God wants to
[8:04] be involved in their everyday life but
[8:07] I'm here to tell you this is the God of
[8:09] the Bible he's not a God who wants to
[8:12] live ten million miles above us hardly
[8:16] caring about what's going on but he
[8:19] wants to be in us he wants to live
[8:21] through us
[8:22] he wants to be very aware of all of our
[8:26] needs because he is our source our
[8:30] source of strength our source of healing
[8:32] our source of truth he desires to walk
[8:36] with us and to talk with us to be
[8:40] involved in our everyday life religion
[8:43] will deny you of that privilege of
[8:46] relationship but true commitment true
[8:51] intimacy with him Oh to be a friend of
[8:54] God
[8:55] to know that that we are the apple of
[8:59] his eye and that nothing happens to us
[9:02] that catches God by surprise he is ever
[9:06] ready and willing to lead us out of any
[9:10] situation that we find ourselves in in
[9:13] learning to lean on him and in learning
[9:16] to be obedient to the Spirit of God in
[9:19] order for these strategies and tools
[9:22] weapons that God has given us to work we
[9:26] also have to be vigilant we have to make
[9:29] sure that we're not giving the devil any
[9:32] place to climb up to exalt himself in
[9:35] our lives
[9:36] this scripture neither give place to the
[9:38] devil is rendered in the amplified
[9:41] version leave no such room I like that
[9:46] so much
[9:47] leave no such room or foothold for the
[9:52] devil give no opportunity to him in
[9:56] climbing a mountain or in a rock
[9:58] climbing wall you're constantly looking
[10:01] for a higher hand hold a higher foothold
[10:05] a place to put your hand to pull your
[10:08] weight up a place to put your foot to
[10:10] help support you as you gain the the
[10:13] inertia the strength that you need the
[10:15] motion that you need to climb God's word
[10:19] is telling us don't you give the devil a
[10:21] foothold let him find no place in you to
[10:26] be able to so his lies his deceit his
[10:31] seductions and destructions well how do
[10:34] we do that how do we make sure that
[10:36] we're not giving the devil any room in
[10:38] our lives well the easiest way is to be
[10:41] so filled up with God there's no room
[10:44] for the devil the more practical way is
[10:47] to watch your thoughts and watch your
[10:50] emotions at the end of our last program
[10:54] we talked about briefly how the enemy
[10:57] will use our emotions we're emotional
[11:00] creatures and emotions were given to us
[11:04] as a gift by God to enhance our lives
[11:06] not to destroy us
[11:09] our soul Ram the realm of the soul where
[11:12] the mind and the will and the emotions
[11:14] work in itself that is not our enemy
[11:18] God wants to direct all of those areas
[11:21] of our life by the power of the Holy
[11:23] Spirit but when our emotions get stirred
[11:27] in a negative way I'm telling you we can
[11:30] get so confused so caught up in the
[11:33] moment of anger or jealousy or
[11:36] resentment or bitterness or whatever it
[11:39] is that the enemy is slinging against us
[11:41] we can get so caught up in the emotional
[11:45] reaction to what we're going through
[11:47] that we get spiritual amnesia and we
[11:50] forget all the principles that God has
[11:53] made real to us in our life of how to
[11:55] defeat the enemy and how to climb higher
[11:58] in the Lord Jesus Christ
[12:00] your emotions have to be they have to be
[12:03] dealt with they have to be gently led
[12:06] there are times that you have to make a
[12:08] conscious decision
[12:10] I'm not going to yield to the emotion of
[12:13] this moment I'm going to remain rock
[12:16] steady in what God's Word has promised
[12:19] for instance if you receive a bad report
[12:23] from the doctor after having believed
[12:25] God's Word for your healing your
[12:29] emotions of fear and uncertainty doubt
[12:34] can overwhelm you at that moment and
[12:37] cause you to forget all the powerful
[12:40] truths that you've been standing on what
[12:43] you've been claiming what you've been
[12:45] decreeing about God's will desire and
[12:49] power to heal you it seems that we can
[12:52] we can be paralyzed by fear our emotions
[12:57] can pull us in such a way that we just
[13:00] want to lay down and give up that's why
[13:04] we have to learn to watch our emotions
[13:06] in the same manner we're watching over
[13:09] our imaginations and we're pulling our
[13:12] thoughts making them captive so that we
[13:15] can submit them to the truth of God's
[13:17] Word we have to learn at times to be in
[13:21] charge of our emotions to make sure that
[13:25] we don't allow our emotions to pull us
[13:28] out of the place of faith look no matter
[13:32] what the doctor says
[13:33] it doesn't change God's Word the
[13:36] scripture actually says whose report
[13:38] will you believe it's not always easy to
[13:42] choose God's report when our emotions
[13:46] are haywire because we've heard
[13:49] something bad or something negative but
[13:52] it's in that moment that we must ask the
[13:55] Lord for strength that we can be
[13:57] rock-solid
[13:59] standing on the word of truth
[14:02] surrendering to our emotions can hinder
[14:05] our journey by giving the devil a place
[14:08] of opportunity a place to foot put his
[14:11] foot a place to put his hand
[14:14] in our life rather than doing what the
[14:17] scripture said giving him no room giving
[14:20] him no space can you imagine the
[14:23] emotions that were stirred in the soul
[14:26] of Abraham when God told him you must
[14:30] leave your country your kindred your
[14:33] people and sojourn to a land that I will
[14:38] show you he was following an inner voice
[14:41] the voice of a god that he had never
[14:43] seen the voice of a God who had never
[14:47] even revealed his name
[14:49] and yet Abraham took the bold step of
[14:53] faith to be obedient to a voice to leave
[14:58] behind everything that was familiar to
[15:01] him to make this journey and by the way
[15:05] he didn't know at the beginning perhaps
[15:07] just how difficult that journey would be
[15:10] but because of the faith of Abraham
[15:13] through the seed of Abraham the whole
[15:17] world is being blessed today from the
[15:21] nation of Israel comes the most amazing
[15:24] technology for communication or media
[15:28] for medicine for health it's incredible
[15:32] the way that God has blessed that little
[15:35] nation of Israel with such intelligence
[15:39] with such ability in such grace to be
[15:43] able to bless the entire nations of the
[15:45] world did you know that Israel is one of
[15:48] the very first nations to respond to any
[15:52] country when there's a natural disaster
[15:55] did you know they engineer things as
[15:59] simple as bandages that have saved tens
[16:03] of thousands of lives on the
[16:06] battlefields of our world or in natural
[16:09] disasters God has just given a special
[16:13] gift to the seed of Abraham and I'm
[16:16] thankful for it because it's another
[16:19] confirmation of how God's Word works but
[16:22] what if Abraham would have been so
[16:25] called
[16:25] up in grieving over leaving his family
[16:28] his business is kinfolks
[16:31] all that was familiar to him what if he
[16:34] would have allowed his emotions to lead
[16:36] him instead of the voice of his God well
[16:40] I would say things would have been a
[16:41] whole lot different than they are today
[16:43] we have many biblical examples in the
[16:48] scripture where emotions could have
[16:51] gotten the best of somebody but by the
[16:54] gentle leadership of the Holy Spirit
[16:56] they were able to find their strength in
[16:58] the truth of God's Word and victory came
[17:02] because they stood on truth and were led
[17:06] by truth by obedience and not led by
[17:09] their emotions I'll tell you Abraham
[17:12] certainly felt the sting of kissing his
[17:14] human emotions it wasn't all easy for
[17:17] him to move forward and God's destiny
[17:19] plans for his life but he made the right
[17:22] decision as did many many others as with
[17:25] Abraham we have a promise that God will
[17:28] empower us to move beyond our emotions
[17:32] those emotions that attempt to hold us
[17:36] captive I'm telling you you can get
[17:39] caught up in a cycle of grief for
[17:42] instance we know that grief is a gift
[17:45] from God it's a it's a an emotional a
[17:49] mental processing of loss if we didn't
[17:54] have the ability to process loss grief
[17:58] through our emotions we wouldn't be
[18:01] healthy people today God gives us these
[18:06] emotions he gives us these gifts such as
[18:09] grief to be able to process the loss a
[18:12] lot of times we're grieved not for the
[18:16] person especially if they've gone to a
[18:20] better place and we have confidence that
[18:22] they died in faith knowing the Lord we
[18:26] know they're in a better place than the
[18:28] one we're in and we would never call
[18:29] them back but we often grieve for our
[18:32] loss because we loved them because we
[18:35] enjoyed their companionship their fellow
[18:38] ship we are going to miss them and so
[18:41] God gives us this process of grief
[18:44] through our emotions it doesn't look the
[18:47] same for everyone and that's why we have
[18:49] to be very careful when we're judging
[18:52] the way people grieve
[18:53] however grief and the emotions that
[18:57] accompany grief can become a vicious
[18:59] cycle a trap for the children of God
[19:03] what God gives us as an emotional
[19:07] release to help us process the loss the
[19:10] enemy will take advantage of that and he
[19:12] would like to capture us in a cycle of
[19:15] grief that paralyzes us from moving
[19:18] forward in God's destiny plans for our
[19:21] life what do we do we've got to learn to
[19:24] recognize when an emotion when when a
[19:28] process of emotions even a cluster of
[19:32] emotions are causing us to walk in
[19:35] defeat they're causing us to miss out on
[19:39] opportunities that God is giving us to
[19:41] move forward we've got to be able to
[19:43] recognize that and use God's Word as a
[19:47] tool to dig ourselves out of a trap that
[19:51] emotions can sometimes set for us in our
[19:55] lives
[19:55] I believe God will empower you to get
[19:58] out of that trap if you recognize anger
[20:02] is another vicious emotional cycle I am
[20:06] Telling You anger in itself is not a sin
[20:10] in fact the Bible tells us be angry and
[20:13] sin not let not the Sun go down on your
[20:15] wrath what that's really saying to us is
[20:19] it's all right not to like a situation
[20:21] it's alright to even be angry at a
[20:25] situation we have to be careful at
[20:27] becoming angry at people because it can
[20:30] consume us but it's alright to be angry
[20:33] at a situation it's also alright at
[20:36] times to be angry with people Jesus was
[20:40] quite angry when he saw his father's
[20:42] house being turned into a place of
[20:45] exchange and he turned over the money
[20:48] tables because they were not only
[20:50] offering a service
[20:51] as they thought but they were actually
[20:53] cheating and squeezing the people and it
[20:56] was not pleasing to Jesus at all and so
[20:59] he dealt with it in the manner that we
[21:01] read about in the scripture so all these
[21:03] things can be healthy in in their place
[21:06] and in their proper balance but anger is
[21:09] a cycle that you can get caught up in
[21:11] and you can be so angry with every
[21:15] situation with every person in your life
[21:18] that you just become angry for no reason
[21:21] for no cause that emotion of anger can
[21:25] so take hold of your life that you
[21:27] become wicked in your plans wicked in
[21:31] your thoughts always lashing out and
[21:35] when that no longer satisfies well you
[21:39] read the newspapers you know what can
[21:42] happen when someone cannot break free
[21:44] from a cycle of being angry at first
[21:47] it's angry for a reason and then it
[21:51] becomes an entire takeover of your life
[21:55] jealousy the same way we often compare
[21:58] our lives with the with the lives of
[22:00] others and sometimes that provokes a
[22:03] little bit of jealousy in us but we just
[22:06] like anger we pull that down before the
[22:09] end of the day we just submit that to
[22:12] the truth of God's Word if you feel that
[22:14] little you know green-eyed monster of
[22:17] jealousy rising up in you and in a
[22:19] non-productive way you just pull that
[22:21] down and you just submit that to God's
[22:24] Word and you just say Lord I've learned
[22:26] that in whatever state I am in to be up
[22:29] to be blessed to be satisfied to be
[22:32] content because you you sit above it all
[22:35] and you'll take care of it all but if
[22:37] you allow that jealousy to continue to
[22:40] stew and build and express itself in
[22:43] your life it can take over and you can
[22:46] be consumed with not only jealousy but
[22:48] bitterness and envy and strife and anger
[22:51] it goes on and on so one of the things
[22:54] that we have to watch out in the devices
[22:57] and schemes of the enemy is he seeks to
[22:59] whip up our emotions to stir them up in
[23:03] a non healthy and
[23:04] productive manner how do we deal with
[23:06] that well we come back to God's Word we
[23:08] find where our peace comes from our
[23:11] peace is not the absence of turmoil or
[23:15] situations in our life that are that are
[23:17] less than perfect peace is knowing God
[23:21] peace is trusting in Jesus Christ he is
[23:25] our peace and when the enemy comes to
[23:28] disturb our peace in whatever manner and
[23:31] with whatever emotion he chooses we have
[23:34] to make that conscious decision come
[23:37] back to rest come back to peace come
[23:40] back to trust we have a great big God
[23:43] who is sitting above it all and who is
[23:46] more than able to see us through no
[23:49] matter what the enemy has in store for
[23:51] us and there is a unseen hand a great
[23:55] hand of God that's both guiding us and
[23:58] protecting us so one of the ways that we
[24:03] keep the enemy at bay and we keep our
[24:06] emotions in check and we don't allow the
[24:09] enemy to get a foothold or to get space
[24:12] in our life is to renew our minds we can
[24:17] keep our emotions in control we can keep
[24:21] our even our imagination and thoughts
[24:23] and control we can keep a lot of things
[24:26] in proper balance and order in our life
[24:28] through this gift that God has given us
[24:32] the grace to renew our minds the enemy
[24:37] cannot get ahold of us if we are
[24:39] consistently renewing our minds with his
[24:43] word the Word of God
[24:44] and endeavoring to walk in the perfect
[24:48] will of God
[24:48] this renewing process is just that it's
[24:52] a process it's not an automatic behavior
[24:57] automatic action reaction it's not a one
[25:01] sin for all one time thing settled never
[25:04] have to be troubled again the renewing
[25:08] ing the renewing of the mind is indeed a
[25:13] process
[25:14] is a grace it is a gift from God and we
[25:18] need to begin to try to get a hold of
[25:20] that truth and practice it put it into
[25:24] action in our lives the Bible tells us
[25:28] in Romans chapter 12 verse 2 and be not
[25:32] conformed to this world but be
[25:35] transformed by what the renewing of your
[25:41] mind that you may prove what is that
[25:46] good and acceptable and perfect will of
[25:52] God did you know that God has a good
[25:56] will for you an acceptable will for you
[26:01] and a perfect will for you but the enemy
[26:06] desires to use your emotions to stir you
[26:10] so that he can pull you out of God's
[26:13] good perfect and acceptable will for
[26:16] your life he wants you to be spinning
[26:18] around in a tornado of emotions and
[26:22] that's why God has given us according to
[26:25] the instructions of the Apostle Paul
[26:27] here he's given us the Grace and the
[26:30] ability to renew refresh actually it's a
[26:36] recreation of the mind it's that
[26:40] powerful of a transformation remember
[26:44] that before it tells us how to renew our
[26:47] mind it says we must not be conformed to
[26:50] this world we must understand as
[26:54] believers we're citizens of another
[26:57] world we've come from eternity by the
[27:00] grace of God and we must not become
[27:04] conformed to this world I'm telling you
[27:08] when we start adjusting to the world
[27:12] around us instead of standing up for
[27:15] truth we're on a dangerous slope of
[27:18] destruction you are not created for such
[27:22] a time as this to follow the fat
[27:25] and the fashion of the world around you
[27:28] the world around us is moving toward
[27:32] insanity but God has a royal race he has
[27:36] a holy people on planet Earth
[27:39] for such a time as this who will not be
[27:42] conformed to the image of the world that
[27:45] that word conformed is an interesting
[27:47] concept it's for instance maybe you have
[27:52] some of you have have have seen or maybe
[27:55] even participated in a in an art or a
[27:59] craft where a mold is formed and then
[28:03] you pour for instance hot wax I remember
[28:08] when I was a small child and and my
[28:11] grandparents took me to a to an
[28:13] amusement park in Florida that was that
[28:16] was based around animals and beautiful
[28:19] gardens and I remember that one of the
[28:22] fun things to do was there were machines
[28:25] that you could drop a coin in and a mold
[28:29] would come up in the machine
[28:31] hot wax would be poured down into that
[28:35] mold and in a few minutes that mold
[28:38] would open up and down would drop some
[28:42] kind of little figure I remember I
[28:46] certainly don't have it anymore
[28:48] but I remember a bird I remember the
[28:51] coin going in that machine in the mold
[28:54] opening up the wax being poured in red
[28:58] hot wax poured in the mold the mold
[29:01] closed in the machine a few minutes
[29:03] later it opened up and out dropped this
[29:06] little bird for a souvenir this is this
[29:09] is the concept of the word conformed
[29:12] we're not to take on the form of the
[29:17] world around us we're not to be shaped
[29:20] by the things around us I believe God's
[29:23] speaking to somebody right now and I
[29:26] hope you'll have an ear to hear this
[29:27] it's the enemy's design and desire for
[29:31] our lives that we would take on the
[29:34] shape of the world around us that we
[29:36] would feel the
[29:38] pressure to be like the world around us
[29:40] but here's what the scripture said be
[29:43] not conformed to this world do not take
[29:47] on the form of the world but listen but
[29:51] be what transformed this is a word
[29:56] similar to metamorphosis where a total
[30:00] change takes place that little
[30:04] caterpillar it has a complete meltdown
[30:07] so to speak he spun his cocoon he's
[30:11] hanging there in that cocoon and and the
[30:14] original elements of his body begin to
[30:17] liquefy can you imagine you talk about
[30:21] being under pressure that little worm
[30:24] that little caterpillar in the cocoon it
[30:27] becomes so warm and there and the
[30:30] process of his change becomes so serious
[30:33] that it begins to break down the
[30:35] physical form of that caterpillars body
[30:38] and in the safety of that cocoon his
[30:42] form begins to change it's a process so
[30:49] is our process of transformation our
[30:52] change our transformation is also a
[30:55] process I don't know about you but I can
[30:58] get really impatient when I know a work
[31:01] of changes taking place in my life but
[31:03] not fast enough we've got to learn to
[31:06] trust the hand of God and the timing of
[31:11] God and know that whatever you're going
[31:13] through at this moment it's hand-picked
[31:17] it's chosen God knows you better than
[31:22] you know yourself and he allows the
[31:25] circumstances of our situations to
[31:28] squeeze us to warm us to the place that
[31:31] we begin to break down in our original
[31:34] form and instead of being conformed to
[31:38] the mold of the world around us inside
[31:42] of the cocoon of the anointing we are
[31:45] being changed
[31:46] it is a metamorphosis it is a
[31:49] transformation
[31:50] and one day that cocoon of safety begins
[31:54] to open up because something on the
[31:57] inside wants to come out and if you've
[32:01] been blessed enough to see this new
[32:05] creature emerging from the cocoon I have
[32:09] we have a butterfly center not too far
[32:12] from our home and I've seen with my own
[32:14] eyes the the amazing beauty of God's
[32:19] creation what was such an ugly green
[32:22] worm eating every leaf in sight has now
[32:26] become a new creature I tell you there's
[32:29] not much to identify in the butterfly
[32:33] that was like the caterpillar it's been
[32:37] a total transformation a total
[32:41] metamorphosis and this is what happens
[32:43] to us when we learn the grace of
[32:47] renewing our minds we are changed we are
[32:51] transformed we have a metamorphosis from
[32:55] the inside out and we can become that
[32:58] new creature that no longer has to crawl
[33:01] around in the lower elements of the
[33:03] earth but we're now set free with wings
[33:06] to soar to be free because old things
[33:12] have passed away behold all things have
[33:15] become new for you are a new creation
[33:17] you are a new creature in Jesus Christ
[33:21] so this renewing of the mind is a very
[33:23] powerful gift from God because it
[33:26] Grace's us with the ability to change
[33:29] our attitude to change our thought
[33:31] process to change our emotional life
[33:35] from the inside out let me read that to
[33:38] you in the amplified it says do not be
[33:41] conformed to this world this age
[33:44] fashioned after and adapted to its
[33:48] external superficial customs but be
[33:52] transformed be changed by the entire
[33:56] here that entire all by the entire
[34:02] renewal
[34:03] of your mind by its new ideals and its
[34:07] new attitude God has a new attitude for
[34:10] you he has a new mindset for you he
[34:15] wants to change the frame of your mind
[34:17] and help you to walk in submission to
[34:21] his perfect will he wants you to be able
[34:23] to control your emotions and thoughts
[34:25] instead of your emotions and thoughts
[34:28] controlling you if we can learn some of
[34:32] these very simple processes some of
[34:36] these simple methods that God has
[34:39] outlined for us in the scripture we can
[34:42] defeat the devil no matter what scheme
[34:45] no matter what device he chooses to use
[34:48] against us at any given time let me
[34:52] finish reading this in the amplified
[34:55] fashioned after and adapted to its
[34:58] external superficial customs that's
[35:00] being conformed to the world but be
[35:02] transformed be changed by the entire
[35:06] renewal of your mind by its new ideals
[35:09] and its new attitude so that you may
[35:12] prove for yourselves what is the good
[35:16] and acceptable and perfect will of God
[35:19] even if the thing which is good and
[35:22] acceptable and perfect in his sight for
[35:25] you even the thing which is good which
[35:29] is acceptable which is perfect in his
[35:32] sight for you the last time we were
[35:35] together we talked about a three-fold
[35:38] strategy for tearing down for breaking
[35:40] down strongholds I want to I want to
[35:43] close our program out today with this
[35:47] process maybe you could call it another
[35:51] three-fold process that is involved in
[35:55] the renewing of the mind maybe it'll
[35:58] break it down and make it a little bit
[35:59] easier for you and you can maybe jot it
[36:02] down and remember if you miss anything
[36:04] in any of our programs you can go to
[36:07] youtube and find our channel there and
[36:10] go back in and catch any scripture or
[36:13] any point that you might be interested
[36:15] in but the process
[36:16] yes of renewing our mind involves three
[36:19] steps number one we must be willing to
[36:23] change that sounds so simple it is
[36:26] simple but it's not automatic because
[36:30] even though we may be caught up in the
[36:32] swirl of a heavy trial or a dark time in
[36:36] our life we think most of the time we do
[36:40] it right we know what's best we've got
[36:42] it right we've got to be willing to say
[36:45] Lord what I'm doing is not working and
[36:49] I'm willing to change my approach I'm
[36:52] willing to change my thought process I'm
[36:55] willing to change my stubborn will
[36:59] alright and submit myself to what you
[37:04] have for me in this particular moment in
[37:07] this particular hour in order to be
[37:10] willing to change you've got to be
[37:11] willing to accept the fact that you may
[37:13] not be right that you may not have been
[37:16] handling the situation in the right
[37:18] manner in the first place and you've got
[37:21] to be willing to submit your will to the
[37:24] good the perfect and the acceptable will
[37:27] of God and quite honestly my will may
[37:31] not be the Lord's will I might have to
[37:36] come to a place in my life where I'm
[37:38] able to recognize that his way is the
[37:41] right way the best way his will is the
[37:45] right will the best will oh how sweet it
[37:49] is when we are able to recognize and
[37:52] identify that we're in the will of God
[37:55] that our will has come into agreement
[37:59] with his will I'm telling you that's the
[38:02] happiest season in life to know that
[38:06] we're doing the perfect will of God
[38:08] I was recently in a service on Sunday
[38:12] night in the hills of Virginia where I
[38:14] was asked to speak after the Sunday
[38:17] morning service I was asked to travel an
[38:20] hour to speak in a little country church
[38:22] among people that I love very very much
[38:24] my physical body was screaming no my
[38:28] emotions were saying
[38:30] I am too tired to drive that distance
[38:33] and to preach but something in my heart
[38:36] was saying it's wonderful to be wanted
[38:39] it's wonderful to be called on and it's
[38:43] wonderful to have fellowship with people
[38:45] that we love and if not had that
[38:47] opportunity to fellowship with in so
[38:49] long and so I agreed reluctantly to go
[38:52] and I struggled a little bit with my
[38:55] preaching because I was tired my mind
[38:57] wasn't as sharp as I really wanted it to
[39:00] be but when the time for prayer came and
[39:02] the anointing of the Lord was present
[39:04] for just a few moments you know
[39:08] sometimes it's ever so brief that we
[39:10] feel it but for just a few moments I
[39:12] realized that I was standing in the
[39:16] perfect will of God for that moment
[39:18] sorry there's no greater feeling I could
[39:24] have been you know in fact I told the
[39:27] family and friends my plans for Sunday
[39:31] afternoon there was no service in the
[39:33] church where we were visiting and my
[39:36] plans were to go to the pastor's home
[39:39] and sit in one of those big rocking
[39:43] chairs on his porch and watch the Sun go
[39:46] down over those beautiful Virginia
[39:48] mountains that's what I wanted there
[39:50] wasn't anything wrong with that it
[39:52] wasn't it wasn't entirely selfish I
[39:55] don't think because God wants us to have
[39:57] rest at times and he wants us to have
[40:00] the desires of our heart but that and I
[40:02] believe God would have allowed me that
[40:04] but it wasn't his perfect will for that
[40:07] evening and so off we go well there were
[40:10] several car loads of us that went and we
[40:13] had our rooftop carrier on the top of
[40:15] the vehicle and no luggage in it our
[40:17] luggage was in the hotel and so we're
[40:20] getting on the interstate we forget
[40:22] about that that it's empty and when it's
[40:25] empty sometime the wind can make it make
[40:27] a terrible racket sounds like it's gonna
[40:30] rip right off the top and we had to
[40:32] drive an hour on the interstate like
[40:33] that with that thing just jerking around
[40:36] and making such a racket and get on our
[40:39] nerves
[40:39] and you know given your stress but all
[40:42] of that was worth it it was really no
[40:44] sacrifice at all but if there would have
[40:47] been a sacrifice if there if there would
[40:49] have been a price to pay it would have
[40:52] all been worth it for that few moments
[40:54] when God was moving through the little
[40:57] ministry that he's given us and he was
[41:00] blessing God's people and the look on
[41:02] the pastor's face and the happiness and
[41:06] the joy that was in his heart to see his
[41:08] people being ministered to all of that
[41:10] combined with that few minutes of
[41:12] knowing I'm in God's perfect will for
[41:15] this moment there's not a higher joy
[41:18] than that I could have been speaking to
[41:19] thousands of people and not have felt
[41:22] that joy of knowing in that little
[41:26] country church I was in the perfect will
[41:29] of God
[41:29] for that moment I'm telling you that to
[41:33] encourage you to let you know there is
[41:36] that moment for you there is that moment
[41:38] for you you may have not had that sense
[41:42] in a long long time
[41:43] that you were in the perfect will of God
[41:45] because the enemy has been fighting you
[41:48] and frankly sometimes he's been winning
[41:50] against you but God's using our time
[41:54] together I truly believe he's using our
[41:57] time together to help you to be more
[42:00] aware that you would not be ignorant of
[42:03] the devil's devices but that you would
[42:05] be very aware of the ways that the enemy
[42:08] is working against you and that you
[42:10] would take up the sword of the Spirit
[42:13] that you would take up the weapons that
[42:15] God has given you and the whole armour
[42:17] of God and you would begin to defeat the
[42:21] enemy one situation at a time well that
[42:23] would be my greatest desire and there
[42:26] are times in this program and in this
[42:29] setting that I have a small sense of
[42:31] that of that same feeling that I was
[42:34] describing a moment ago right now there
[42:37] are other things I could be doing and
[42:39] sometimes I feel should be doing but all
[42:42] for that moment of knowing that for this
[42:45] moment I'm doing exactly what God would
[42:48] have me to do there's no price tag a
[42:51] moment like that is in
[42:53] valuable and I want to encourage you to
[42:55] keep reaching for that keep working
[42:58] through the processes that goddess is
[43:00] giving you in your life and pull those
[43:03] emotions into check and allow your mind
[43:08] to be renewed that you would not be
[43:11] conformed to this world but that you
[43:14] would indeed be transformed by the
[43:17] renewing of your mind three steps in
[43:20] this process number one we must be
[43:23] willing to change number two
[43:25] we must present ourselves to the Lord as
[43:29] sacrifices as offerings unto God in
[43:34] holiness we've got to be willing to say
[43:37] Lord all that I am everything I hold is
[43:41] because of you and I want to offer back
[43:46] to you the blessing the giftings the
[43:50] graces that you have given to my life I
[43:52] want to offer them back to you as praise
[43:55] as little as they seem sometime as
[43:58] insufficient as I feel sometime I want
[44:02] my mind to be renewed because I'm
[44:04] learning to be willing for change to be
[44:08] willing to change and I am desiring to
[44:12] present my body as a living sacrifice in
[44:16] Romans chapter 12 we read verse 2 but in
[44:21] Romans chapter 12 verse 1 here's where
[44:24] this where this idea comes from it comes
[44:26] right out of the same chapter he said I
[44:30] beseech you therefore brethren by the
[44:32] mercies of God that you present your
[44:36] bodies a living sacrifice all that I am
[44:41] all that I can accomplish all that I do
[44:44] let it be done unto you and for your
[44:48] glory I believe that if we were
[44:51] constantly aware that our life is an
[44:55] offering to God we would be a whole lot
[44:57] more careful about how we live our lives
[44:59] I truly believe that is a fact
[45:02] by the mercies of God
[45:05] that you present your bodies a living
[45:08] sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God
[45:12] which is your reasonable service one
[45:17] translation of that last phrase of that
[45:20] verses which is the least that you can
[45:22] do hasn't he been so good to us hasn't
[45:26] God been so good to us in our lives 50
[45:30] years of life here on this planet and I
[45:32] can tell you God has been so good to me
[45:35] why wouldn't I want to live my life as
[45:39] an offering unto Him it's easy to be
[45:45] conformed by your circumstances to this
[45:49] to this image of wanting to just do
[45:52] things your way it's it's easy to become
[45:57] that kind of a person well I've done
[45:59] this so long I'll just do it the way
[46:01] I've always done it but God wants us to
[46:03] be pliable he wants us to be moldable
[46:06] tender in his service sensitive to hear
[46:10] his voice because what if God has
[46:13] something new for you what if God wants
[46:15] to lead you in a new direction with a
[46:17] new path with a new place of authority
[46:19] what if God wants to release you into a
[46:22] new mission field if he wants to call
[46:25] you into a place that's unfamiliar to
[46:27] you and you like Abraham have to leave
[46:30] behind some familiar things to step out
[46:33] in obedience you'll only be able to do
[46:35] that to find the grace to say yes to do
[46:39] that by constantly yielding to the
[46:44] process of renewing your mind so we must
[46:47] be willing to change we must present our
[46:51] bodies ourselves as offerings as
[46:55] sacrifices holy and acceptable unto God
[46:58] and number three we must not be
[47:00] conformed or fashioned to this world
[47:03] which we talked about in the beginning
[47:06] of that verse taking on the mold or the
[47:10] shape of the world around us I want you
[47:12] to know God's Way may may not be the
[47:16] average way it may not be the most pop
[47:19] it may not be what some people would
[47:21] call the normal way but it's the right
[47:23] way God's way is the right way and to
[47:28] discover God's Way to not be led by our
[47:31] emotions or led by our circumstances we
[47:35] have to walk in that's in that place of
[47:38] allowing the Holy Spirit to renew our
[47:40] minds we absolutely do in all three of
[47:45] those steps to be willing to change to
[47:48] to make up your mind I'm going to
[47:50] present my life and my body to God as a
[47:53] sacrifice as an offering for his glory
[47:56] and to refuse to be conformed to this
[47:59] world but be transformed by the renewing
[48:01] of our mind all three of those steps or
[48:04] stages are dependent upon us becoming
[48:07] saturated in the Word of God one of the
[48:10] first series that we did when we started
[48:12] doing these programs in partnership with
[48:14] the gospel channel was taking God at His
[48:17] Word the importance of God's Word in our
[48:21] everyday life and how the truth of God's
[48:24] Word helps us to deal with every measure
[48:27] of unbelief that's in us and I just
[48:29] encourage you to let God's Word work
[48:32] mightily in you God's perfect will in
[48:35] our lives is most often revealed to us
[48:39] by the Word of God or in the Word of God
[48:42] I truly believe it's a road map for life
[48:46] by eating God's Word daily our minds
[48:49] then become fashioned and shaped into
[48:54] his will his way we come into perfect
[48:58] agreement with God's perfect will in our
[49:01] lives and that happens by daily feasting
[49:04] on God's revealed word it it causes our
[49:08] desires to be holier sharper more
[49:12] perfect it deals with our will it causes
[49:16] us the deal with the issues of the soul
[49:19] it helps us to lay our our mind down and
[49:23] take on the mind of Christ that daily
[49:26] consistent faithful prayerful washing
[49:31] of our lives with the Word of God is so
[49:35] powerful in learning to walk in victory
[49:37] and to walk in great success when it
[49:42] comes to recognizing and defeating the
[49:46] schemes and the devices of the enemy so
[49:49] when we need to know God's will we find
[49:53] it by searching God's word allow the
[49:56] Holy Spirit to take that word and speak
[49:59] to your spirit man I'm telling you I've
[50:03] seen God do amazing things in in
[50:07] directing his people by and through his
[50:10] word bypassing that mind will and
[50:13] emotions stuff and getting right into
[50:16] the inner spirit man I'm telling you
[50:18] that's where the new creature is that's
[50:20] where the new creation is working his
[50:23] way from the inside out word that's
[50:26] Christ in you being formed in you the
[50:29] hope of glory working the life of Christ
[50:32] from the inside out oh what a what a joy
[50:35] that truly is when we understand that
[50:39] and remember it on a daily basis as a
[50:42] result of searching God's Word and
[50:45] washing ourselves in God's Word a new
[50:47] identity begins to emerge we begin to
[50:50] see who we really are
[50:52] in Christ in fellowship in relationship
[50:57] with him and just knowing who we are
[51:00] just discovering this new identity that
[51:03] is found in him it gives us power it
[51:07] empowers us to be able to take our
[51:10] Authority and see the devil defeated in
[51:13] any strategy that he desires to use
[51:16] against us and as each and every
[51:19] stronghold in our lives is pulled down
[51:22] what we're actually doing is to throning
[51:26] Satan remember we talked about in an
[51:28] earlier part of this series the city
[51:32] where Satan's seat was and what it means
[51:35] to give the devil a place to sit
[51:37] space in our lives foothold our
[51:41] stronghold in our life when we give him
[51:44] a seat
[51:45] means we surrender our authority to him
[51:47] and he becomes the ultimate authority in
[51:50] our life and I'm telling you he will
[51:52] whip you he will direct you he is a
[51:55] slave driver the enemy once he gets you
[51:59] into his into his captive hand he will
[52:03] he will work you to death he will drive
[52:06] you until you are bankrupt and you have
[52:09] nothing left and that's why we must not
[52:12] surrender our authority to the enemy
[52:15] it's why we must find our new identity
[52:19] in Christ through the word and allow our
[52:22] minds to be renewed as each stronghold
[52:26] in our life is pulled down we did thrown
[52:28] Satan from his seated position of
[52:31] authority in that particular area of our
[52:34] lives is it an addiction is it a habit
[52:38] it's at a family matter do you feel like
[52:42] you're caught up in a generational thing
[52:44] that you can't break free of one by one
[52:48] allow the Holy Spirit to direct you with
[52:51] your weapons with your tools to pull
[52:54] down strongholds until ultimately the
[52:57] devil has nowhere to sit over your life
[53:00] he is de throned and when that begins to
[53:04] happen that's when that new identity in
[53:06] Christ really begins to explode in us
[53:09] and it changes the way we think and it
[53:13] changes the way we speak the reason why
[53:16] we've got to get our thoughts right is
[53:18] because we've got to get our confession
[53:20] right it's very very important
[53:23] the throning Satan is an individual
[53:26] responsibility I can't take him off his
[53:29] throne in your life if I have a throne
[53:31] in my life where he sits you can't take
[53:33] him off of the throne in my life
[53:35] it's an individual responsibility but
[53:38] the atmosphere of deliverance can be a
[53:42] corporate expression we can come into a
[53:45] service where the Spirit of God is
[53:47] moving and their strength in the unity
[53:49] of the Brethren and we that's a great
[53:51] opportunity to call out to God for what
[53:53] you have need of when we all come into
[53:56] the house
[53:56] of God with our licks of fire and the
[53:58] anointing is increased because we come
[54:01] together in one purpose that is a great
[54:03] opportunity to begin to confess the
[54:06] truth of God's Word over your life and
[54:08] to let the devil know I'm on to you
[54:12] I'm onto your schemes I'm learning the
[54:15] way you have worked in my life and buddy
[54:17] your days are numbered your throne over
[54:20] my head is about to come down and I'm
[54:23] going to walk in the victory that the
[54:25] Lord Jesus has given me and once we do
[54:28] throw in the enemy from our personal
[54:29] lives we can to throne him in our
[54:32] families in our churches and our
[54:34] businesses even sometimes over our
[54:37] communities and our regions but it
[54:40] always starts with a personal victory it
[54:43] always starts with a de throwning of
[54:46] Satan in your own life I'm talking to
[54:48] believers I'm talking to children of God
[54:51] born again of the Spirit of God and yet
[54:55] we have yielded and we have allowed the
[54:57] enemy to build the stronghold
[54:59] this death structure this throne over us
[55:02] it's time to kick him off the throne and
[55:05] allow the Lord Jesus Christ to rule and
[55:08] reign again from the inside of the
[55:11] inside of your being that's his desire
[55:13] father I ask you right now in the mighty
[55:16] exalted name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[55:19] take these Bible truths Lord I believe
[55:22] that everything I've been teaching in
[55:24] this series is based solidly on the Word
[55:26] of God and I'm counting on that
[55:28] because I know the power that we have by
[55:32] the Word of God and I'm asking you right
[55:35] now to quicken these truths into
[55:37] individual lives that we might apply the
[55:41] Word of God in every situation to see
[55:44] the enemy defeated every stronghold
[55:47] broken and to see Satan cast off of
[55:51] every throne that he has built that you
[55:54] by the Holy Spirit would come and rule
[55:56] and reign from the Ark of the Covenant
[55:58] of our own spirit man that you would
[56:01] come and sit on the throne that we're
[56:03] building for you on the inside of the
[56:05] inside of who we are that is our desire
[56:08] Oh God
[56:10] grant that right now we pray in the
[56:12] mighty name of Yeshua our Messiah the
[56:15] Lord Jesus Christ
[56:17] I believe there's victory for you I
[56:19] believe there's victory in you if Jesus
[56:22] lives in you then victory is living in
[56:25] you it may seem a little contain
[56:28] consuming or a little bit of effort
[56:30] involved here in pulling some of these
[56:32] things down I agree you're right it
[56:36] takes a little effort it takes a little
[56:38] labor it takes a little faith but all my
[56:41] the benefits are well worth the time the
[56:46] benefits of knowing that Jesus is
[56:48] exalted in your life that your mind is
[56:52] being renewed and that you are going
[56:55] forward with the whole armor of God in
[56:59] your life to defeat the enemy so that
[57:02] we're not always playing the defense the
[57:04] enemy makes a move and we scramble
[57:06] around trying to to counter-attack
[57:08] brother it's time for that little
[57:11] remnant bride of Jesus Christ to rise up
[57:15] on the offense and take territory that
[57:18] the enemy has occupied in our own lives
[57:21] in our families and in our communities
[57:24] and churches for much too long thank you
[57:28] so much for being a part of this study
[57:30] and we have a couple of more sessions to
[57:33] go and I hope you'll stick with us I'd
[57:36] like to see you coming forth with the
[57:40] victory that God has actually allotted
[57:43] and determined for you
[57:45] for such a time as this pray for the
[57:48] gospel channel and send your prayer
[57:50] requests will be happy to pray with you
