TRANSCRIPT
========================================
assemble oh Jacob all of the I will surely gather the wom of Israel I will put them together as the Sheep of bosra as a flock in the midst of their pasture they shall make great Noise by a reason of the multitude of men praise the Lord I'm Pastor Steph Shelly and you're watching the Eagles cry we want to welcome you to the broadcast today we've been having a wonderful time in the word of God I better say I've been having a wonderful time and I pray that you have been if you've been following these last few programs we've been preaching teaching on the theme from obscurity to visibility and I I certainly believe that that's where we are in the body of Christ and we want to continue to share perhaps uh wind up this theme and move on to something else if the holy spirit will let us but before we get into the word let me invite you to visit our web page revival. G on the worldwide web please take a moment and visit the ministry website there there is great information there for you uh I'm sure that there are things there that will be a blessing to you one of the things is uh a link that will help you to subscribe to our podcast so that you can actually download the episode of the Eagles cry right onto your computer and even listen or view it later uh from your computer or right onto an iPod or other mp3 mp4 player so you know technology Marches On Hallelujah and I think it's a wonderful way uh to help you stay in touch with what's going on here at the New Hope Revival ministries uh we are in a small community called Smith Station Alabama the address is always given to you there at the bottom of the screen we are in the United States of America and uh most of you have probably heard of Atlanta Georgia we're about 100 miles southwest of Atlanta Georgia and sort of in the country but you know God's doing wonderful things here we have a 60 acre Campground where our church Sanctuary is we have men's prayer chapels women's prayer chapels and then we also have our ministry Offices here and uh there are some young couples who live here on the campground and work and serve the Lord and serve the ministry and well lots of good things are happening and you can keep up with some of the goings on by visiting the website and I invite you to do that also send in your prayer request because we want to pray with you we want to believe God with you until the victory comes and then we want to praise God with you we want to Worship the Lord with you because we believe that God still answers prayer and he is able to do exceedingly and abundantly above that which we could even ask or think could we get right into the word of God we have a lot of ground to cover today we're going to read from Romans chapter 12 and verse one we've been reading in Isaiah now for the past few weeks Isaiah chap 58: 5 through 14 uh from obscurity to visibility is the theme of that verse of scripture but we're going to carry that theme a little bit farther today in in Romans 12: 1 and 2 verse one says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God remember that one of the definitions of obscurity is uh having um uh something that is not clear something that needs to be clearer or have more clarity and so we see in this verse of scripture uh that God wants us to know and to move and to live in the good acceptable and perfect will of God well we can't always do that unless it's been revealed to us and when we say revealed we mean in clearness we need the Lord to make things very clear to us by the Holy Spirit and I believe that that is his desire he has done that for us in the past but what we're preaching about and teaching about is a theme of a new season in the spirit where God is just saying I want to so clearly reveal to you my will my plan my desires for you that you just can't miss them and you know we all live with a a a measure of fear and and maybe fear is not the best way to express it but we live with the measure of of something like fear and yes fear at times of missing the will of God not knowing the mind of God not recognizing exactly what God would have us to do but I believe that the Lord wants us to know and one of the ways that we can come to that place of knowing the good and perfect will of God Is by following the advice that's given to us in the scripture that we present our bodies a Living Sacrifice that we give of ourselves not not just our body meaning the flesh but also Body Soul and Spirit because man is a Triune being made up of body which is flesh soul and the inside of the inside which is the spirit of man and so we want to see as John G Lake would describe many years ago we want to have Triune salvation complete total salvation and deliverance in our body in our flesh in our soul and also in our spirit in order to do that we have to continuously present our bodies this is not something we do once and never have to come to God in humility again we do it daily as the Apostle Paul talked about crucifying the Flesh and dying daily so daily we come to the Lord daily we present our bodies as a Living Sacrifice to him holy and acceptable unto God that means we've got to find out what is pleasing to the Lord and that's what we need to do when we say holy we don't mean Holy by the church standard we mean Holy by God's standard what is it that God is looking for in our lives what measure uh is he Desiring that we come up to so that we can fulfill the stature of a perfect man that Peter was talking to us about in one of his Epistles we want to come to that place of transformation that this scripture talks about in verse two be not conformed to this world you know what that means it means don't take on the world's shape don't take on the image of the world we're looking for the image of God we want to become partakers of the divine nature of God and the spirit of this world is enmity with the spirit of God diabolically opposite to the spirit of God the spirit of the world is completely totally opposite to the spirit of God so we don't want to take on the image the shape or the form of this world the fashion of this world but we want to be transformed look at this be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed changed gloriously changed how by the renewing of your mind daily coming before the throne of grace asking the Lord for more of his favor and more of his grace to be able to see the renewing of our mind we know that discouragement is a great attack that the enemy launches against the body of Christ we talked about that a few weeks ago right here on the broadcast one of the ways that we can maintain encouragement and stay away from discouragement is to remind ourselves daily what God is doing for us and what he has done for us meditate on the faithfulness of God and not spend all of our time pondering on the promises that have not yet been fulfilled the things that we would yet love to see God do and he hasn't done and we want to remember those promises they're precious we want to hold on to them we want to believe God for the future fulfillment of all that he has spoken but we want to be faithful as God has proven faithful we want to be faithful to praise him to worship him to to go around with a spirit of thankfulness and Thanksgiving for what he has done and for what he's going to do oh I I love him I love serving the lord Jesus Christ he never fails he is exactly what he said he would be and he keeps his word you know men sometimes are slack in keeping their promises but God is Not slack concerning his promise if he promises it he means to bring it to pass and as we said before he may not come when you want him but he's right on time God moves in a different time zone a time uh uh scale than what you and I we move on Kronos time that is measured by the calendar by the sand hourglass the sand in The Hourglass or the sun on the sun dial or the watch on our wrist but God's time his timing is different and we may think that that it's passed due and God may say no it's not time yet so that's one of the reasons why in this hour of God bringing us from a place of of Shadow obscurity into a spotlight unveiling us because he's been working on us getting us ready for this great showdown of God's power where we're going to go forth and and give life to those who are needy we're going to speak words of Deliverance to those that are oppressed we're going to heal the sick and raise the dead and set the captives free we're going to minister in the love and compassion of Jesus Christ and before we do that we've been in this great time of equipping and preparation and that takes place behind the veil underneath the great curtain but God's getting ready to to uh uh snatch off the veil and to unveil his Masterpiece the living bride of Jesus Christ what will she look like just like the bridegroom what would she speak just what the bridegroom would speak what will she do just what our lord Jesus Yeshua the Messiah our Heavenly bridegroom what he would do she will have thus saith the Lord and when she speaks she will speak the mind of God and angels will hasten to perform that which she the bride of Christ the wife of the Lord Jesus Christ yes the adopted sons of God all of these scriptural um analogies these scriptural examples that we paradigms that we have looked at over the years they're all culminating and consummating In This Moment Hallelujah that's why it's so important as I said a moment ago that we as Believers those who are filled with the spirit of God that we don't live our lives based on on chronos's time but we're more interested in Ciro's time the timing of the Lord those seasons of heightened spiritual activity when the Lord is saying this is the season for such and such if God says this is a season for healing then we want to get the sick in we want to bring the sick in so that they can be healed if God says uh in this coming hour I'm going to begin to deliver the drug addicts like never before we want to know that we want to be sensitive to his will we want to hear his voice clearly so that we can bring the drug addicts in the times and Seasons knowing them Discerning them and walking in them is one of the most important things that the body of Christ must learn to do in this last hour one of the ways that we learn this is by the renewing of our mind by meditating on the word of God by not looking at present circumstances but standing in the word of God firmly rooted and grounded in thus saith the word of God be not conformed to this world verse two but be ye transformed changed totally revolutionized by the renewing of your mind that's how important the mind is that's how important and you know you hear a lot of talk about the Mind Body Connection and I know people may take that to the extreme but one day I was praying for some friends that I love very dearly and God said uh it's all in the mind tell them it's all in the mind it's a mind thing and we started preaching a little bit on the mind and uh one of God's Great generals brother brandham William Branham uh uh in one of his great messages great fiery sermons he talked about the the Battlefield of the Mind and he said it's in the Battlefield of the Mind that the greatest battle that's ever been fought is being fought in this hour you you see Satan wants to to uh war against you in your mind and in your thought process he wants to keep you from being able to inherit the promises he wants to uh discourage you and he wants to disqualify you because he his ultimate goal is to derail you from your destiny he wants to dissect you from your destiny he wants to cut it aund a the lifeline he wants to cut off the lifeline if you will so that you are no longer connected to the plans and purposes of God but we say no we say no to the devil we say no to the enemy and and we claim that by the authority of Jesus Christ we say no over our children we say no over our families we just serve notice on the enemy you cannot have our loved ones we're Standing on the Promises of God's word daily being transformed daily being changed by the renewing of our minds that we may be able to prove not just talk about it's one thing to talk about it it's another thing to be able to demonstrate it and that's what we're after in this hour the grace of God to be able to prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God and we can find that in the scripture what God's will is his will is for you to prosper his will is for you to be in good health his will is for you to walk in the spirit and not after the flesh his will is for there to be healing in your hands his will is for you to be able to speak with the power of the spoken word and Watch God's word uh come to pass right before your eyes now when we look at that word transformed in the Greek be ye not conformed to this world but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind in Greek that word is the is the root word of where we get the word metamorphosis it's like metamorpho and we use that word metamorphosis we all learned it in school remember in the early years of science we learned a big word metamorphosis which is a an extreme change and what uh what were the circumstances that we learned the word metamorphosis do you do you remember do you recall it is concerning the caterpillar and the Butterfly and I have some notes here I don't like to read a lot of notes to you on the eagle cry but I want to read these notes to you just a little bit then that word renew the renewing of your mind it means a renovation Hallelujah uh complete change for the better and that's what we're looking for a renovation of the Mind a complete change for the better instead of thinking the the negative thoughts the doubtful thoughts we want to think what God God would have us to think but I did a little research some years ago about this metamorphosis that takes place the the caterpillar you know it's this little worm and he eats and eats and eats and eats and eats in fact he eats his own eggshell so he comes into the world eating and then he eats leaves and everything that he can find and he eats so much that he gets so fat that his skin breaks and he sheds his skin and and science says that one particular caterpillar can shed his skin four or five different times and that reminds me of of what I've experienced in the spirit you know sometimes we learn and we grow and we we get stretched and we expand and we lose our skin and God has to give us a new wine skin but that's all right that's okay that's what this is all about growing and and growth there are 90,000 different varieties of caterpillars that make butterflies this caterpillar uses liquid from its own body to spin a little button of silk on some solid object like a twig of a tree or something it then spins a silk girdle to hold itself upside down connected to this little silk button the pupus thorax swells breaking open again the caterpillar's skin eventually a hard shell forms over the pupa called a chrysalis and you've seen that it's a beautiful stage where the caterpillar is not caterpillar and it's not butterfly yet oh it's somewhere in between and the pupa does not eat at this stage while the greatest changes are taking place and you know what I say about that is we we need to eat the word of God Feast on the word of God while we have the opportunity to do so Amos said that there is a famine of uh not of bread or water but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord and and uh of course there are times where we go through spiritual droughts and spiritual famines and so I think it's very important to get as much of God's word in us when circumstances are going good so that when we begin to face the fiery Trials of Life we've got a foundation to stand on so eat eat eat you're like a little caterpillar eat God's word eat it eat it eat it because it's doing something we may not feel the transformation but it's taking place on the inside these changes can take as little as 10 days or as long as 8 months when the adult butterfly is formed inside the shell it gives off a fluid that loosens itself from the shell see God's got everything under control the thorax swells to crack the shell when it makes its way out its outer skeleton is still soft and its wings are only little pads by tightening its muscles it pumps air and blood through its body and wings the body hardens and the wings flatten also and expand in about 30 minutes the butterfly is ready to fly now I want you to know this is quite a metamorphosis from this little worm crawling along on the branch to now being so transformed so changed that it's no longer a worm it's no longer a little creature that has to depend on C falling but now it has a set of wings what a change and this is the same word that's used here in Romans 12 and2 but be ye transformed metamorpho where we get this science of metamorphosis What A change is taking place so you know when the enemy tries to discourage you and call you an old worm you just feel like an old worm well you just tell him I may be a worm today but tomorrow I'm going to be a butterfly they sing an old country song Some have kind of made it a gospel song that says I'm just an old chunk of coal but I'm going to be a diamond one day that's a promise of God I claim that I claim that but uh I I must tell you did you know what it takes to make coal transformed into a diamond it takes time and it takes lots and lots and lots and lots of pressure pressure and you know we're experiencing pressure from the inside and from the outside life can get hard but oh how sweet it is to know that no matter how hard life can become our God is with us and he is an awesome God who never fails who is never given us a reason to think that he would ever fail and this great process that's taking place behind the veil this metamorpho metamorphosis this transformation as our mind is being renewed as we are being Sanctified cleaned set apart by the washing of the water of the word until we come to that place where the Lord Jesus says here she is she's just like me she's in my image and for a quick short spell I'm going to loose her and let her have a Ministry in the earth I believe that with all my heart I'd like to share and I I don't have but just a very few uh um minutes to do that but I'd like to share just a a couple places in the song of songs in the King James version of the Bible it says uh The Song of Solomon but Solomon named it himself the song of songs which belongs to Solomon or or given by Solomon in the song of songs chapter 1 verse one but anyway in chapter 2 verse 8 it says the voice of my beloved and of course there's not time to develop this whole scenario but this is h a love story between Solomon and uh his uh this beautiful woman that he has fallen in love with but we believe that prophetically it talks about the love affair the love relationship between our Heavenly bridegroom the Lord Jesus Christ and his bride and when we say bride we mean the one new man bride so we're not just talking about uh a Jewish bride we know God has a covenant with Israel and the Jewish people but we know that because Messiah has come he has torn down the middle wall of partition Romans chapter 11 and he has allowed us to be grafted in and we now stand before him as one new man so this is a beautiful beautiful love story okay so chapter 2 ver8 the voice of my beloved behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains skipping upon the hills my beloved is like a rower a young heart behold he standeth behind our wall he lookth forth at the windows showing himself through the lattice do you know what lattice work is it's the like crisscross you know and so you're only seeing through a portion of the of the openings the lattice and that's what I want to say I want to say that our bridegroom has been appearing to us in the Spirit through his word through his manifest presence but over the years it has been more like he's been standing behind the lattice but there's an unveiling that's taking place it's a dual unveiling he is unveiling himself revealing himself to us and by doing so we are being transformed by the renewing of our mind we are being change and then he's going to unveil us as his Masterpiece do you follow me I think it's it's a tremendous truth that we need to get a hold of verse 10 my beloved spake and said unto me rise up my love my fair one and come away for Lo the winter is passed the rain is over and gone verse 13 the Fig Tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with a tender grape give a good smell Arise My Love My Fair one and come away this is the wooing of the bridegroom the calling of the bridegroom oh my Dove ver vers 14 Thou Art In The Cliffs Of The Rock in the secret places of the stairs now I love that now real quickly go to Song of Songs or Song of Solomon Chapter 3: 6 who is this that cometh out of the Wilderness like pillars of smoke perfumed with myrr and frankincense with all powders of the merchant when we read these next few verses it's describing Solomon the bridegroom so when we when we get it when God reveals it to us by the spirit what we're reading in these verses is a beautiful prophetic picture of the coming of the bridegroom he unveils himself first he reveals himself first he steps out from behind the lattice and comes into Plain View I mean the fullness is what I'm looking for the fullness of Messiah knowing him intimately acquainted with him being changed by soaking in his presence well my time is gone and I've certainly enjoyed it father I just release the spirit of all that has been spoken let it go forth let it stir in people's hearts and may we all become hungry for more of you in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Yeshua we pray amen thank you for watching the Eagles cry byebye for today
