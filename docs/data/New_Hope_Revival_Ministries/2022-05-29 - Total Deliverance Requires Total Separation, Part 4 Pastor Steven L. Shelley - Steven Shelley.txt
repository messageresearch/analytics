crystalline today in prayer she is sick and in need of our prayers she needs the touch of the lord we want to remember her yes sister sandy mann got some very sad news concerning her mother's condition that the cancer was progressing is that right and i know they're heavy this morning but i know that the lord is able he's able to deliver he's able to heal if if he has another plan then he's able to comfort these hearts yes it's a very difficult path to walk but i know god is more than able amen let's take these needs to the lord today would you sing that little course turn your eyes upon jesus look full in his wonderful face turn your eyes upon [Music] look for in his wonderful face [Music] and the things of earth will grow strangely down in the light of his glory and gracing again oh i will turn my eyes upon jesus look for in his wonderful faith and the [Music] thieves of earth will grow strangely [Music] in the light of his glory and grace heavenly father as we approach you today we come with thanksgiving in our hearts so grateful that you have saved us you have drawn us you have delivered us you have given us grace and strength and faith to continue to walk lord when all around us we see darkness we thank you for the light the glorious light of the gospel of jesus christ that we can fix our eyes on and keep walking in the light as you are the light and we want to thank you lord that you have continued to give us the revelation of jesus christ lord magnifying in our hearts the goodness of god in our lives now god we bring to you the needs of the people they are many lord as i looked out over this congregation and saw the hands being lifted god some of the needs i know about but lord i'm so glad that you know way above what we know god you are already on the cases you're bringing deliverance and help and hope lord god you see sister sandy's mother today and you know all things and we want to just commit her into your hands and ask that you would overshadow all of the family with your tender love and your care o lord and that they would be able to focus right on you and say lord thy will be done and not mine i pray god with every need that is in this house we would everyone's be able to yield ourselves and say lord your plan and your purpose for our life whatever your purpose is we know you're a healer we know you're a deliverer we know god that you do all things well perfectly and so god when we can rise up and yield everything to you and just say god let your purposes be accomplished in our lives then lord will see the glorious light of jesus christ shining abroad in our hearts and everything being in perfect order according to your plan lord we do that today as we come and we sit under the sound of the word we all have questions lord we have things that seem not to be right in our lives but i thank you that the word is on target and i thank you that the word does not return void but it accomplishes whereto it is sent and so lord as we come presenting ourselves sitting under the sound of the word today we're asking lord as our pastor comes and he takes the microphone and begins to speak of the word of god lord that there would be the pull and the draw the pull and the draw god i'm asking that the questions that we have could be settled the answers right on target lord i thank you that's who you are you god never miss the mark never you miss the mark oh lord i thank you that you're on target today and that your word is going to accomplish where to it is sent so we just present ourselves lord and say here we are hit the mark lord answer our questions we're not coming haughty we're not coming with a high spirit but we're coming lord yielded to the purposes of god now get honor and glory out of the rest of this service lord you do what you want to do and you do it how you want to do it we'll give you glory honor and praise for it is in the name of the lord jesus christ that we pray amen amen amen can you give the lord a shout of praise today oh i praise you lord [Music] hallelujah you may have your seats today we're so glad to see you in the house of the lord [Music] it is such a blessing to be able to come and sit in the house of the lord to stand to worship in the house of the lord with fellow believers and we have some of our congregation with us today that we don't get to see every week but we're so glad to have sister terry lawler with her mother's sister sister gert hammond sister terry's daughter rebecca with her daughter maya sister terry's daughter hannah with her daughter natalie we're so glad that they're here with us today now if you forgot their names that i just spoke i want you to learn them because they are a part of this congregation though we may not see them every service they have driven 12 hours 10 hours eight hours eight hours to get here to be in one service to be in fellowship with us because behind that camera is not the same as being in fellowship with god's people and so i honor them today and i want you to fellowship with them we want to give them all the fellowship that we can while they're here want the spirit of the lord to just come down in this service heavier and heavier and heavier as this service progresses today until that every need that we have it can be met you know i was thinking as we were singing about being free in the spirit and and and the chains breaking off of us i was thinking i'm sorry but my mind went first to something very carnal i never had a television growing up but i had plenty of heathen friends and i remember the incredible hawk remember how he turned green and he got bigger and bigger and he stretched out of his clothes well then i got a little more spiritual and i began to think about samson when samson was laying in the lap of delilah and she listened to his voice and he talked about being wrapped up with a certain cord but as long as he did not reveal the secret of the lord when the spirit came upon him he was able to break out of those cords but when he finally revealed the true secret of where his strength came from he arose and he said out of his own mouth i will go out and be as i was at other times but because that he had yielded the secret to a heathen to an unbeliever he had yielded that secret then he could not break free of that thing that came upon him and he was then put as a workhorse to grind and be sport for the philistines then my mind went to the scripture in romans to whom we yield our members to whom wield friends we've got to be fully yielded every part of a spirit soul and body we've got to be yielded to the holy ghost and if we will yield our members to the holy ghost and not to this world when the enemy comes to try to put a chain or a confine of some sort on us the spirit of the lord if we'll yield to the spirit too many times we have allowed the enemy to keep us bound under that thing and when the spirit of god began to move we were willing to remain under the guilt to shame the condemnation of what had happened behind us rather than to come under the yielding of the holy ghost to let that chain fall i'm convinced that there are many times in life we have worn chains much longer than we needed to because we did not yield to the holy spirit but he's here today and he's calling us to yield to him and i want to yield everything that i am all that i am all that i could ever be i want to yield to the holy spirit so that no chain has the opportunity to stay on my life he's here he is here the holy spirit is here to move in our lives he's already moved among us and he's going to continue to move in this service we're just yielding to him saying lord you do in me what you want to do not every service is the same and if we tried to manufacture to make it the same then it would become common and we would lose what god wants to do but if we'll just say lord you do it how you want to do it i'm just yielding to you sometimes hallelujah sometimes praise the lord sometimes gently singing our hearts in one accord that's what he wants he wants us to be in one accord under the spirit of god so that he can do what he wants to do if you've come today with your tithe and your offering we want to give as giving unto the lord david will you come michael christian will you come and go to the people as they give up their tithe and their offering once again i would like to mention and thank you that you have given since march of 2021 216 367 toward this principle on the loan the loan balance now standing at two hundred and fifty seven thousand one hundred and fifteen dollars and i am so grateful to god for this thank you lord if you're able to stand with us today would you do that can you stand and give your tithe an offering as well sometimes hallelujah [Music] sometimes praise the lord [Music] sometimes gently singing our hearts in one accord [Music] sometimes hallelujah [Music] sometimes praise the lord sometimes gently singing [Music] our hearts in one accord sing against [Music] hallelujah sometimes praise the lord sometimes gently singing our hearts in one of those [Music] sometimes hallelujah [Music] sometimes praise the lord [Music] oh we love the lord we love him don't you love him don't you love him this morning oh let's lift our hands and tell him that we love him today lord jesus we love you you are worthy you are worthy to be praised lord we glorify you today we love you jesus we give you honor and glory and praise for you alone are worthy you alone are worthy you alone are worthy blessed be the name of the lord god bless you you may be seated this morning this afternoon now isn't it almost almost in the lord good to us today praise the lord this young man who's come in the back back there do we you look familiar to me have we ever seen you here before no where are you from are you from this area that's not too far away is it god bless you you're welcome here this morning brother greeley has already mentioned the other visitors and we're so happy because he calls some home folks and that's what we believe they're not really visitors god bless you all we have quite a few people who are missing this morning for various reasons but we're holding them up to god in prayer that he will touch them and bless them and help them can you say amen are you with me this morning today is the 55th anniversary on the jewish calendar of the reunification of the city of jerusalem and i've had the blessing to be in israel on jerusalem day and it's one of the most exciting days of the year there are a lot of celebrations taking place in the city and there were many miracles that took place during that six-day war to place jerusalem back in the hands of the jewish people and so because tomorrow is memorial day i see people posting all the time about veterans day tomorrow but it's not veterans day tomorrow's memorial day and uh we are remembering those who gave their lives for our freedom and there were many men our apartment in jerusalem the church maintains apartment in french hill and french hill is just up the hill from ammunition hill and ammunition hill was one of the most important battles in that war to place jerusalem back in the hands of the jewish people so during this time of remembering those who gave their lives both for the purpose of god in the land of israel and for freedom in our nation we we just honor we do we want to remember those who paid the ultimate price it doesn't matter whether you believe in war or agree with war or all the principles of war men went trusting that their lives would make a difference and not knowing whether or not they would come home and i for one appreciate that sacrifice families lost loved ones and they also made a sacrifice so we want to honor that uh tomorrow is also a another very special day chad it's may the 30th that means it's your birthday and uh we don't always mention you know every birthday is good that's right but sometimes you get decades and half decades right and so chad is having a half decade birthday tomorrow and uh i don't know how hard he's taking it but since i discovered it yesterday i've been taking it pretty hard because when you think about your your your babies your kids you know uh i i really were peers but i never felt that way until all of a sudden it hit me in the face that he will be 45 i'm telling the world of course jennifer slipped me a little money to tell it i'm in the pulpit i shouldn't tell tales happy birthday chad [Applause] on tuesday is aaron graves birthday he's on the camera hold up your hand so everybody can see you i don't think you're going to be 45 you're not going to be 45 are you 12 years old amen and then thursday i don't see matt and kayla this morning but thursday june the second is kayla drost's birthday so if you are connected with her in some way on media or text be sure to remember to wish her a happy birthday and brother anthony chadwick who's streaming this morning has a birthday on friday we want to wish him a very happy birthday and also on friday is maya yovich's birthday so make sure before the day's over you wish her a happy birthday and uh it's also a brother and sister skipworth's anniversary they were married she and brother payton were married the year i was born so this would make them 54 years and the lord called brother skipworth home a few years ago yes ma'am oh in 67 i've written it down and always had it at 68. so 55 55 years wow that's a long time and i know that you miss him we miss him we miss him and but god gave them a very good life together and so we want to mention that and then on saturday of next week is a very important birthday at my house and that is my wife's birthday and i'm not going to dare even tell you if you don't already know if you want to know her age ask brother greeley [Laughter] he'll tell you he'll tell you uh it's also zoe's birthday zoe payne and uh it's a good opportunity for you to think of her and pray for her and lift her up and to god and austin's birthday is the same day austin not not not new austin but old austin austin yantus i don't know if he'll be back or not but you can let him know and it's also i know it's calendar's taking a long time this morning but uh sometimes we have no birthdays in a week but it's also heir shavuot and what that means is at sundown the biblical feast of shavuot begins and the church knows that better as pentecost so next weekend we celebrate the birth of the church the prophet is clear to tell us that the church was born on the day of pentecost he says it and he said she is a pentecostal church he said in fact any church that's not a pentecostal church by experience is not a real church he said because you've got a pattern like the original and so uh it's a wonderful time for us to to think about the goodness of god and what he's done for us and uh the jewish nation celebrates the giving of the torah the giving of the law on mount sinai took place during shavu time and we celebrate the baptism of the holy ghost there's a white bowl back there and i was going to tell them to just move it aside a little bit if they needed to because i know that mamaw would be very very happy to know that emily was sitting in her seat with that sweet little baby girl this morning and i wanted if they need to make room uh by moving that a little bit they can but for those of you who were able to be at sister tebow's funeral homegoing celebration here the lord his presence was real the building was was packed full and uh her family was uh just really really uh under uh a wonderful attitude and a wonderful spirit i know there was grieving but you know it it's uh it's hard uh to to just be broken in pieces all the time when you catch a thought or a glimpse of knowing how she had lived her life to be present with the lord and so there was a lot of joy there was sadness but there was also a lot of joy and there was a lot of witnessing that was taking place and uh i won't tell you this morning in the pulpit we'll tell it later if we're fellowshipping today but there was a bit of a celebrity here uh or at least the son of a celebrity and uh who was at the funeral and i didn't even know this until after the graveside but but at the graveside he walked up to me and he said i don't normally say things like this but he said you're real and this church is real he said i know this is real he said i know the difference and this is real well i thought that was nice i i said a little something and uh you know trying to respond and and he said a few more things that i won't mention just now then i get in the vehicle and i'm making some comment about it and they said well you know who he is don't you he's the son of a very famous comedian and i didn't know that doesn't matter he's the same as anybody else right but i just thought lord look at mamaw she testified her whole life telling everybody about the goodness of god and then she leaves us and they come to say goodbye and that witness is still going out because if you heard brother billy's testimony that's what she said she said i just want to go up there and shake his hand because i know that's real wasn't he going to stay for a service you just wanted to come and make that witness i know this is real how many of you appreciated brother billy sharing her testimony with us it was special very very special and we appreciate that so much god is so good to us amen let's thank god for these musicians we could sing another hour but we're blessed to have them all thank you for the sacrifices you have made it's been a busy weekend memorial service and wedding showers and all kinds of things taking place always volleyball these are the volleyballingest people i've ever met my life always volleyballing we want to welcome all of you who are streaming this service today from the netherlands from cape town south africa from indiana from the uk god bless you sister ethel we're praying for you uh indiana again israel god bless you that are streaming there in israel uh also again south africa trinidad all that's on youtube and there's a host of other people who are who are streaming in kentucky and across the country and iceland and and many other places and we appreciate you uh watching and praying for us and we're praying for you let's stand let's see what the lord will do for us amen he's good all the time i want you to turn again to luke chapter 4 if you will i want to read verses 16 through 21. we're in the middle of a series here uh and we're talking about total deliverance but we understand by the word of the lord that total deliverance requires a total separation from unbelief and we're not all there yet but we're working to get unbelief out of our life because we want a total deliverance we're looking for that and i know we read this some services back but i want to just get this in the record again in luke chapter four and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for to read and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaias and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord now we know that the acceptable year of the lord is the year of the lord's favor and it refers to in leviticus the jubilee year the 50th year pentecost is a 50th year it's a 50 it's a 50 we should say and so when he is standing up he is declaring that there will be a jubilee of jubilees when this scripture is fulfilled this is going to be the ultimate year of the lord's favor a season of real deliverance and of real jubilee because the one that is to bring all of this healing uh he will come from god and his ministry here's his mandate this is the ministry mandate of jesus to preach the gospel to the poor to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captive sight recovering of sight to the blind and to sit at liberty them that are bruised so this is the ministry mandate and the model of our lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them this day this day remember it was not permitted for him to speak he made aliyah he came up to the bhima he read from the scroll of isaias his job now was to go sit down and be quiet perhaps another person would come and read another portion because there was a portion set aside for every sabbath and so he did something highly out of the ordinary as he's walking back to his seat he announces to all of those who were gathered in the synagogue that day this day it's powerful amen this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears they begin to look around and wonder isn't this isn't this joseph's son isn't this boy just an ordinary boy the son of an ordinary man an ordinary carpenter and here he has declared i am the one about whom this scripture is written father we thank you today that you are indeed that one and you have gathered us in your name cleansed us by your blood filled us with your spirit sanctified us by your word today we are gathered in your name to lift you up and to exalt you and to declare again that you are the same god and that you are still setting captives free and that there is no reason why any of us should have to continue to labor under a load of slavery for you are the great emancipator and you have set us free from the law of sin and from the law of death we ask now that you would anoint our ears and our hearts to receive your word and anoint your servant to share it and we'll give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the saint said amen you may be seated we know from leviticus 25 and they'll flash the list up there for you again that in the jubilee four things were to take place and that was number one all men were proclaimed to be free number two all the prison doors were opened number three all slaves were released and number four all returned to his original possession or his original inheritance what we have received in jesus christ is not just a jubilee but it is what the old testament tells in hebrew calls in hebrew a jubilee of jubilees we're talking about one that once it begins it doesn't have an ending now we who study the hebrew scriptures have learned that in the history of israel there is very little record of israel ever observing very many of the 50-year jubilee there was always something going on they were either in slavery they were in bondage they were occupied they were under some adverse circumstance and it seemed like every time the 50th year would come around that there would be some reason why they were not able to allow the land to remain fallow without any planting and without any any hoeing and without any work only to eat that which would spring up of itself from the ground and you know i find that to be a tragedy of sort we know that there were times that the jubilee was celebrated and there were some times in history that slaves went free but i also wonder if if maybe it wasn't for a reason because it always kept them looking toward the next i believe they said well this year we didn't get to but but next year next 50 years next 50 years if i'm not alive to see it all possessions return to their original owners all inheritance given back to those who owned it in the beginning my children will see it and if if they don't see it in their time my grandchildren may see it and so they just kept looking to the next 50 years and the next 50 years and the next 50 years there were margins of fulfillment there were times that some of these things happened but very few times that all of the different aspects of jubilee actually take place and then one day all these years later in a little synagogue in nazareth stands a little humble man the son of a poor carpenter come on one that's very familiar to all of the people there this is his hometown and he gets up to make his aliyah he comes up ascends up to the bhima and he begins to read and walking down he says this day this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears now you know what he's saying because it the acceptable year of the lord was absolutely referring to the jubilee now he said this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears we have no history to tell us that that was indeed a 50th year we have no history to prove to us that that was indeed an actual jubilee and yet he would say jubilee is here jubilee deliverance is here healing for the brokenhearted is here sight for the blind is here and how many of you know then for nearly 2 000 years we can say jubilee is here hallelujah then why do we find ourselves slaving when he has done such a perfect work on our behalf why do we feel like we have to strive to see how good we can get when we realize there is nothing good in me i am not capable of doing good without the good one here who lives inside of me even the greatest missionary and apostle of them all the apostle paul he was struggling he had been in ministry for years and he said when i seek to do that which is right evil is present in my innermost being there is a warfare going on oh wretched man that i am who will deliver me from this now you know what paul was the first church age messenger and the church ages begin to unfold in his ministry and go on but according to the bible there's a seventh there's a seventh age there's a seventh atmosphere and that was laodicea and we find ourselves in the laodicean church age now and we find a church that isn't either hot are you with me neither cold but lukewarm and why don't we just go a little bit farther and say and in great need of deliverance great need of deliverance so so many of us were over there you know hoeing our way through religion in our respective churches doing all that we knew to do they're always putting something new on us always some new rule i'm not against convictions but i'm talking about rules and regulations and you know people would we would have testimony service and people would use the testimony service to say oh i i need to pray more that's not really a testimony it's a confession and we don't have booths it's i need to oh if i could just read the bible more oh if i could just pray more if i could just fast more if i could just do something else more and there we go just continuing to hoe down the road always in the grind trying to convince ourselves of god's love for us amen never feeling worthy we sing these old songs you know unworthy of unworthy unworthy a wretched poor law sinner and then we're afraid we get a little better and but we're afraid to tell it exactly like it is so then we say i'm just a sinner saved by grace you know this is a very strange identification to me sinner saved by grace i know this is kind of the 12-step way i understand this is 12-step mentality alway i'm an alcoholic always will be so i'm just always in recovery but i want you to understand that there came a day that the jubilee of jubilees was announced and jesus said that one that the prophets prophesied about here i am this day the scripture is fulfilled in your ears you don't have to continue to hold the role of religion never feeling like god has done a good enough work in you you know we're not only reflecting on ourselves when we have this mentality but we're actually also reflecting on him i want you to know he knows how to save us and sanctify us from the gutter most to the uttermost he knows how to take us from dysfunctional to super functional i don't want to just function normally the world is full of normal normal's overrated i want to function super naturally because we've been called to be a supernatural people if you believe that say amen all right now um let's go to the message jubilee year we're studying this this morning let's go to jubilee year paragraph 73 and let's hit one of these little quotations that we have already used from the jubilee year now in these days when these priests they would take the man out there and maybe hoeing in the cornfield the master walking down whipping him with a whip we're talking about bible days whipping him with a whip hurry up there got to hurry up with this but just as soon as what what what trumpet is this this was the jubilee trumpet there is a sound to jubilee jubilee has a sound you got to know what sound is going forth you've got to recognize the voice that follows the trumpet and as soon as that trumpet sounded that man could throw his hoe down and he could say i won't hold with it no more and that taskmaster that slave driver was forbidden to touch him anymore simply because the 50th year had come and no matter what was remaining on the balance of the debt right the debt was cleared are you with me the inheritance went back to the hands of the original owner and he didn't have to hold any anymore for somebody else if he ever picked up a whole again he was doing it for himself to provide for his own family not to take care of some slave driver or some master out there i want you to know something god's people are not to be a bound up people we're not to be of depressed people i'm just being honest with you and you know my testimony and you know that i know what it means to struggle with depression but i want you to know depression cannot be my identity it can't be my anthem it can't be who i am i was depressed now i know that he has lifted me above and beyond my place of depression [Music] it gives us a new identity it it removes our hoes it destroys our crutches it does away with our excuses and at some point we just have to take him at his word and say lord i'm free i'm not free because i feel free i'm free because he said i'm free and i'm clinging to his word you see we're literal christians here we believe the bible is true and that it can be interpreted literally even though it's a supernatural gospel and if god said i've come to set the captive free then i have to believe that anything that holds me back anything that binds me anything that ties me down i have to believe that if i can trust his truth you shall know the truth and the truth shall it shall make you free now in the message of total deliverance are you ready to go there let before we do show me first thessalonians i know i got you jumping all around sister charity sister beverly said that's all right i'm waiting on charities that's all right first thessalonians 5 23 and the very god of peace the god of shalom sanctify you holy read it holy w-h-o-l-l-y holy and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the lord jesus christ now do you believe that's just a great salutation or do you believe that's possible it's a part of the word so i believe it's possible i believe it's the will of god to sanctify me to set me apart holy w-h-o-l-l-y my whole spirit my whole soul mind will and emotions and my whole body to be preserved blameless until the coming of the lord jesus christ i have to believe that entirely the new american standard says entirely the the complete jewish bible says completely holy completely set apart and that's not based on my holiness can i talk to you a minute about the bush did you know there was a mountain full of bushes there was a mountain full of bushes one day moses was walking along the trail of that mountain and god came down and crawled into a bush and a voice spoke out of that bush and said take off your shoes moses unless your sandals because the ground that you are now standing on is holy ground i want to know what made it holy i i want to know what made that bush any different than any other bush on that mountain there it is it was the god in the bush i want you to know that ordinarily if you look at our life compare it with somebody else's we're really in the natural in the physical no better than anybody else no more special not more intelligent or more talented or more gifted when god said i'm going to make you a holy people he meant i'm going to put myself on you i'm going to eventually live in you by the baptism of the holy ghost and that's what's going to make you holy i believe in coming out of the world i believe in mentally and emotionally checking out of this world and making sure that you have a different life than the world around you i believe in that i believe in that i believe that there are clear distinctions that god gives us in his word he said i want men to look like men and i want women to look like women and i want them to know the difference and i know we're living in an hour where there's a total confusion on the issue but god is not confused he just keeps doing it like he has always done it but i want you to understand that you could live like a monk in a little shack on the side of the mountain and eat cornbread and drink water the rest of your life and not be any more holy because it's not what you do that makes you holy that bush didn't do anything different than any other bush it did what it always did just stood there do i look like a bush it just stood there it just did what it had always done every day of its life and one day god said you're mine today you're my bush i created every bush on this mountain but today you're my bush i choose you didn't the word say you have not chosen me but i have chosen you says the lord so what he did he chose a bush he put himself in that bush he speaks out of that bush giving moses his commission and because god is standing there in that bush the ground becomes holy ground because god is there today you have become a holy people amen even brother greeley who had a lot of heathen friends i had i saw an episode or two myself he was my favorite my kids say sometimes he's still your favorite because of that uh one saying i remembered it all the way through the years you know you won't like me went on you won't like me when i'm angry that was right before the green and the clothes started popping off of him i'm we're talking way back now even brother greeley who come to instruct us this morning from the hulk [Music] it's not about that we don't have a license to just fill our minds on everything the world has to offer but i want you to know you couldn't get secluded enough amen you see i traveled with a friend who wore a saffron robe and it really got in our way i love my brother he's still my brother still my friend but when i traveled with him throughout india and him wearing the saffron robe everyone thought that initially when they saw him and his beard and his hair and his saffron rope they immediately thought that he was a hindu priest and so everywhere we went people wanted to be blessed and so he's blessing them all right they would kneel down and he said in the name of jesus and they would look at him like what i didn't want a blessing in the name of jesus i remember one time someone said i didn't know about this jesus he said you do now he just blessed you but it took so long to get anywhere traveling through the airport and i always told him when i really needed your holiness i really needed his holiness one day brother when we were on a helicopter in the in the foothills of the himalayas and we are flying from a small airport in northern india all the way up into the into the area of sukim the most northern province of india and we're doing that because it takes hours to get there by car and only about 40 minutes to get there by helicopter and i said to him he said i have a car waiting on you here if you'd like to go by car but he said we won't see you till tonight but he said you're welcome there's room and i'd like for you to go with me in the helicopter i said but i really don't like helicopters i said they move really funny i'm used to airplanes and i don't like little ones either but but i i but but he began to tell me he said the road is so curvy that you feel like you're coming back to meet yourself and he said every few miles sometimes feet you have to stop for the monkeys because he said they hear the car coming and they run into the road by the hundreds wanting a treat because they're sacred there's a god a hindu god looks like a monkey and he said there they'll run into the road nobody's going to run over them nobody's going to even scare them out of the way they're just going to slow down and throw some treats out and and he said so the more he talked the more i said let me in that helicopter and he said i'll pray with you i'll pray with you everything will be all right so we get in that helicopter and i want you to know it looks as though i can reach out the door of the helicopter and touch the mountaintops we are flying down in a narrow narrow narra and i i i got my eyes closed i'm trying to find peace and then it drops then it goes flying back up like that and then it looks as though we are disturbing vegetation we're so close to the sides of the mountain that i see the grasses blowing on the mountain from the spinning of the propeller i said this is dangerous this is dangerous brother brother i called his name i don't want to say it on here i said brother this is dangerous isn't it brother nothing and i turned over there look at him he's told me he was going to help me through this with prayer he is snoring and when we get off there i said when i needed your holiness there was none so i had to depend on my ability to call on the lord but he got me through it is not our holiness it is not our righteousness it is not our uniform it's because before the foundation of the world god saw a people in his mind that would choose him even way over in wicked laodicea [Applause] they would choose a different path to follow the mandate of the master come on and by that he allowed you to come in this hour and he because you've called on him he knew you would he saw you doing it before you did and he poured his righteousness on you just like he chose a bush not a special bush just a bush but it became the most special bush on that mountain because god crawled into it let me tell you in an upper room we'll talk about it next sunday but in an upper room pillar of fire divided itself into all those little licks of fire and hung over their heads and what was it it wasn't emmanuel god with us anymore it was now god in us by the baptism of the holy ghost and fire he's now living in us there's no reason why we can't walk in deliverance paragraph 80 of a total deliverance we're not getting very far that's on me pharaoh wanted to agree said moses you all can go but leave your children behind or leave some of your i know i read this tuesday night but i'm reading it again some of your cattle back here he said that's the way the devil wants a christian to come it'll be all right for you to join the church but don't never forgive jones it'll be all right if you can if you can go come on you don't have to give up your smoking drinking line stealing fault finding back body you don't have to give that up just join the church let me tell you something that's not what we're looking for we're not looking for the church to tell us we're all right the bible said you'll know you're saved by the coming of life by the quickening of life by the coming alive of your spirit amen your spirit he said but moses wasn't a compromiser he wanted say it for me complete not this get up and down roller coaster feel good don't feel good believe it don't believe it no no complete deliverance he said we'll not leave one hoof behind we'll take everything that belongs to us when we go to worship the lord hallelujah that's the way the church ought to be we'll take righteousness we'll take holiness we'll take the holy spirit we'll take a unified group when we go to the altar we'll be a real group folks that's what we want in this little house we want a real group we want a real family we want people who will go all the way to the altar together who will go into total deliverance together who refuse to settle or compromise with anything less than what the ministry mandate of jesus promised healing to the brokenhearted deliverance to the captive he said there won't be one hoof stay back here you know and people can pray in such a way till the devil will have to give in he does have to give up when he sees a people that won't turn here and there and everywhere and be persuaded by every wind of every doctrine and every thought on google he's looking for a people that'll trust him more than dr google he said that's the way moses and his group did they got over here and got under the blood i want under the blood i don't want you to leave today until you know that you are under the blood come on now he said you noticed until they got under the blood there was no moses himself he was a unified with god but israel wasn't the prophet got in first and the people followed always a forerunner there still was sin he said and they murmured against moses and they said why why do you do this you bring more trouble upon us because pharaoh just doubled their tally of bricks and so forth remember he said just because they're going to have to they're going to have to produce twice as many bricks he didn't like this this church talk he said that was moses he was completely in the hands of god the prophet told us he said the world is yet to see the world is yet to see what can happen what can be accomplished when one man totally surrenders i think he was the closest to that man that we would ever have as an example and yet he said the world hadn't seen it yet the heaviness of the mandate that god had placed on his life perhaps affected him i want you to know it was a hard journey he fought some of the same oppressive thoughts that elijah dealt with when elijah said i'm the only one brother branham struggled with that he was a human he struggled with that idea there were times that he wondered if there'd be a handful even get out of laodicea but i've got good news for you i want you to know there's a bride that's being gathered even in this hour and she's bigger than a handful it may be a handful here and a handful there and a handful over yonder and in every nation of the world here's some and there's some and another group but god is getting his people together and he's doing it without denomination there's only one thing gathering them and that's the word they're just gathering to the word oh hallelujah you know there was a cry that went out years ago from this place and it came from from nehemiah's day and the scripture was quickened in our heart and we sounded a cry that that produced a body some gone on their own way some have gone back to god who sent them to us in the first place but there was a cry that went out that gathered to people here from many different places anybody with me it surely happened and it was sovereign and the cry that went out said the work is very great and very large and we are separated on the wall that separation is hard sometimes but it said in whatsoever place ye hear the sound of the trumpet what trumpet the one we're talking about the one that gathers the people together in whatsoever place you hear the sound of the trumpet resort ye thither get there for our god shall fight for us there's nowhere i would rather be than under the sound of that trumpet i want to stay under the voice of that trumpet because my jubilee is promised in that voice is anybody with me we'll leave that there that's the way uh he was completely in the hands of god totally delivered from sheep herding to her god sheep he was totally delivered himself but the people wasn't delivered because there was still you're blessed because your pastor still murmurs and it's not all hanging on you they can't say about me what they said about moses that he no longer murmured and only the people continue to murmur i still struggle sometime with murmuring you know it's not my bank account that causes me to murmur anybody want to take a guess at what makes me murmur the most people people boy you all got related to that you you you really understood that because some of you are those people [Music] but i don't know another group of people in the whole wide world that i'd rather be a part of you hear me than this group of people one of these days you're going to see you're going to see some of us move up a little higher and when you do you better get there as fast as you can because that's the way it works when you see leadership getting a little higher when you see them coming out of that murmuring place getting into a place where they're not noticing what they used to notice it doesn't even affect them like it affected them before then you get up as fast as you can because that's how we follow god's order i want i mean it i want it out of me i don't want to murmur i don't want to complain i don't want a bellyache i don't want to be that kind of i want total deliverance come on now well i oh some years ago i saw today when i woke up this morning but i didn't want to quite disturb the house and and i did get on up pretty early but i'm laying there in the bed and i'm looking i like to check my memories for this day i like to go back and relive some of the great things that i've seen the lord doing places that i've been and i think it was 11 or 12 years ago on this day i posted on social media three steps three steps to having uh you know to overcoming whatever it is you need of government number one keep your eyes on jesus and don't look at people number two keep your eyes on jesus and don't look at people number three keep your eyes on jesus and don't look at people how is something so simple so complicated because we're not walking in total deliverance yet but i believe it's possible are you telling me that you believe that there will be people in the earth in the last days who live above the temptations of this lot if i didn't believe that i couldn't say i believe the whole word i have to say that i believe that because i believe the whole word and we know that it won't be for a long drawn-out stretch of time we know that it'll be for a quick short powerful demonstration of god's authority in the earth and then it shifts and the gospel the the wooing of god goes back to to to israel the gentiles have then in that day the last gentile the last one that's coming has come and god has manifested himself in the way that he promised with full adoption i i i don't want to go there i'll i will at some point now let's read on and we've got to hurry too uh why see there still was sin and they murmured against moses and they said why why do you do this you bring more trouble on us pharaoh just doubled their tally of bricks moses total delivered from sheep herding to heard god's sheep totally delivered himself but the people wasn't delivered because there was still murmuring among him one night when god ordained that a lamb should be killed a type of christ and the blood was dipped in hyssop with just weeds calm and humble and put over the little of the door and on the post that's when israel became completely delivered with not a hoof left behind all that belonged to them was delivered all that belonged to them was delivered whoop somebody grabbed that all that but all that belonged to them was delivered see jubilee didn't just promise that my inheritance would come back it promised that my whole family every bit of it you know we discovered i mentioned it twice now this is the third time i hope you'll grab it we we we found out in a little bit of a research that there was one place where the decree of jubilee had no effect and the prophet kept talking about him walling themselves in building all these walls getting tucked in inside a wall city didn't matter how loud the trumpet of jubilee was sounding outside and how many slaves were set free and how much land went back to its original owner but inside the wall city everything remained the same that really has been bothering me and then i got to thinking on that a couple weeks ago when i was studying this on a saturday my mind i thought nobody but god has a strategy for how to get inside a wall city but he knows how anybody know how god discovered how god delivered a people that that that god promised them a land he promised them an inheritance he promised but yet some of the enemy had closed themselves in these walled cities one was named jericho god said i'm going to give you everything in jericho so even when we wall ourselves in god knows how to get us and deliver us he knows how to get inside the city and what did he use what did he use he used a praising army he used a people that marched around the walls of jericho silently until just the right hour just the right appointed minute and those trumpets begin to sound and the people begin to lift up a shout that was heard throughout the land and the bible tells us the walls fell flat so even when someone has closed themselves in if they belong to god he knows how to penetrate the wall city anybody got any loved ones living in a walled city hiding taking their refuge behind the walls where the sound of jubilee has no effect on them but god knows how to get them walls down you know the the uh the language of that i've told you this before the language of that is is pretty powerful because in english it says the walls fell flat doesn't it i think it says something like that and so in your mind you get this idea you don't have to go there stay with me research later do your homework later when i think of that i think the wall standing then like that then you got to climb up you'd still have to do some climbing and maneuvering to get all those walls but archaeologists say they've not been able to find those walls not even rocks from those walls we're talking about big old walls we're not talking about little thin walls we're talking about huge walls usually big enough for at least a chariot if not more than one that's how they built cities in those days so i don't know what happened i don't know if the ground just opened up and the walls went down flat inside that's what many scholars actually believe at least believing scholars believe that actually the ground moved back and the walls just went down in into the ground i don't know if that's what happened if it turned to powder but all i know is that everything inside that city now belonged to the people that god had given it to you hallelujah there was a lot of death and a lot of destruction but god found the one that was his didn't he didn't he do it didn't seem like she would would really count for much her lifestyle had not been so profound and so clean but she had given refuge to some spies hadn't she and do you know she's mentioned in scripture as part of the plan oh yes god knows how i've got some loved ones over in them walled cities and when i get my total deliverance nothing is going to keep them from coming out our faith is going to bring them him bring them to him we're not looking to get them to join a church we don't have a church for them to join we don't have any membership we don't have a roster we don't have a church role we don't give people the right hand to fellowship sometimes we have to give them a right foot of fellowship but not a right hand of fellowship it happens sometime it happens sometimes we ought to be honest about it there are times you just can't walk together that doesn't mean that god doesn't see both he loves both he cares for both just like he did the apostles who couldn't minister together he didn't quit blessing either one of them that's his grace that's his goodness [Music] amen someone said i want to move my letter what what letter we don't have letters i remember being a boy and going to church with my mamaw and they would they would say at the end of the service they'd say you know who wants to trust jesus as your savior yeah and join the church and are there any here for they want to move your letter what they mean is they want you to bring your church letter and now leave your church and join their church and so constantly there was a stream of people going from church to church to church to church looking for the perfect one still do that don't they and it's perfect till they show up [Music] man it's not perfect anymore there is no perfect church except his and his is not confined by walls his is covered with righteousness this is covered with his amen are you with me he said that's when the church shall be completely delivered paragraph 86 when everything somebody say everything when everything come on comes under the blood when your sins come under the blood when you're smoking you're gambling you're cheating you're stealing when you're lying when everything is brought under the blood then there'll be total deliverance now we got to that place and that's when we started talking about my heart as a house and we started talking about those places where we don't really want the lord to get on tuesday night and and you know everyone's got something they've got a closet somewhere in their life some secret some something that they've never really surrendered to the lord and whether we realize it or not it affects our personality it reflects our relationships because we've allowed something to stay out from under the blood we've got to get it in his hands we've got to let the lord deal with those places in our life where we don't want to revisit i know that you're caring a lot of us are carrying pain and we're carrying heartache and we're carrying rejections and things from our past and from our life and we gave everything to christ when we trusted him for salvation except a few things we held back for ourselves and in this hour he wants us to be willing to lay it all down just give it all just give it all to him just let the blood cover it all just let the blood cover it all there are things that we need to make right and there are things that could never be made right we have to discover and discern the difference if you're allowing something in your past that has never been set right to condemn you you're going to have to discover through discernment what to do about that and it may be that you find out that there are just certain things there are certain eggs that can't be unscrambled in certain situations that can't really be changed so you throw yourself on the mercies of god and ask him to give you instruction and help if there's something that you need but whatever you do don't hold that back give it to him and let him cover it with the blood you know there are people that live under the condemnation of divorce god hates divorce it was never his idea in the first place but let me tell you something else god hates he hates to see people abused i know a little bit about abuse my second my mom's second husband my i mean i i never really thought of him as a stepdad because we didn't talk like that but really he had been more of a dad to me than my own dad but he beat my mom you know the story some of you do some of you don't i don't mean he slapped her around i mean he busted her head and put her in the hospital more than one time he moved us away from my family from my grandmother that preached from a pentecostal church that i got to go to on rare occasion and he moved us down to uh to brunswick georgia to uh uh over uh uh saint simon's island and sea island down on the coast of georgia some of you've been there and he moved us down there because he wanted my mom to be away from friends and family so that so that no one would discover his abuse he just just wicked if i but if i started telling you his story [Music] if i started telling you where he come from you know i i you you would have to understand it's it's inexcusable god forbid that we would excuse abuse it's inexcusable but sometimes you get at least a little understanding when you find out what someone has been through unless god interrupts we let god interrupt the cycle abusers abuse and the abused will continue to abuse unless god interrupts the cycle when i go to the dentist in columbus river town dental i drive by hilton avenue and i look across there and see the apartments and i remember the night that my mother was being beaten until he passed out he wasn't always drunk when he abused but this particular night he'd been drinking he just kind of collapsed and she grabbed me i remember it well she came into my room and grabbed me out of bed and didn't even let me put on my clothes i went in my pajamas she drugged me down two flights of steps i couldn't hardly keep up with her because she was running for her life and we'd no more got in the parking lot but we looked back and we could see up a window in the top staircase of the hallway of the apartment and we saw him standing there and we knew he was coming after us and i remember running up hilton avenue with my mom and i remember how winded she was and if i tried for a moment i could hear her breathing right now you ever been in a situation like that you know how it gets written in your mind i remember begging my mama to be quiet i remember saying mama you got you've got to stop breathing so loud but she was so winded from fear and from running that we we hid in a bush she shoved me into a bush and she got down in that bush and and i knew that he would hear us and he heard us he found us there and he forced us back into the house but by the time we got back in the house he was calm enough and he had already gone into the second mode i'm so sorry i love you so much i'll never do this again and my poor mama was so starved for love that she believed his lie it was after that that that he moved us to brunswick and here we go with him she steps away from her job and everything that she had known and her mother it was a big rig of moroe because my dad was still alive and there was still divorce orders and visitation rights and all those kinds of things and we get down there and we don't even come back i only remember coming one time back for a visit on an airplane by myself and was very small i was less than seven and i remember coming back but my dad had retired from delta so they gave me very special treatment i was not afraid to be by myself or to travel by myself because there was not only a stewardess watching for me but one who sat with me the entire time it's the only time i remember coming home and i remember getting off the plane and my holiness granny was standing there waiting on me and she looked like god to me i'd been living in what i thought was hell and i know i didn't have it as bad as some because i was not abused it was only my mom who was being abused i go back and there are times that she ended up twice there in the hospital and i'm staying with neighbors that i don't even really know because he made no arrangements for me to have a place to stay and i prayed and begged god night after night after night to give her strength to be able to leave him so that we didn't have to live like that so i know that god's idea is not divorced i know divorce is not god's idea but i'm also telling you here today that being abused like that is not god's idea either i remember well the last time he beat her so bad so bad and um she was unable to go to work she couldn't go to work in that condition and he got up the next morning and went to work he smashed the television he had already killed a dog that belonged to me he was wild he'd already gone to work and we got up that morning and i remember that i had just had a birthday and i remember that mama wouldn't even let me take time to pack my birthday stuff that had been given to me she wanted to get out as fast as possible and i don't blame her and i remember walking away and being torn i want freedom but i sure would like to bring my birthday presents with me remember it wasn't even seven years old oh i sure would like to bring that stuff with me but but it was impossible to do that and my mama cried everything she throwed in the car part of our clothes whatever she could get in the car she cried every every step of the way she cried we got just outside her right at the edge of town we stopped at a mcdonald's for breakfast i remember what we ate of course it wouldn't be hard at mcdonald's there's not but a few choices to make breakfast my mama was quiet i said mama won't it be wonderful to be out from under that won't this be wonderful and i'll get to go to church you see i had got up sunday morning after sunday morning after sunday morning and stood at our second story window and watched the children getting on the assembly of god school bus to go to sunday school and i cried to go and beg to go but he hated the church hated the assembly of god especially hated the church and he wouldn't let me go and mama didn't want to rock the boat so she wouldn't let me go and i said oh it's going to be wonderful i'll get to go to church mama aren't you glad that we can be free and we don't have to live like that and you don't have to be beat up anymore you don't have to have a black eye you don't have to have stitches anymore and she was so silent and she said to me finally as we were finishing up our meal she said steve i'm going back to him it shocked me how could that be possible how how could she possibly take me how could she possibly take herself back into that she was bound it was an uh an awful soul tie and it was not love the world doesn't know what to call it but it was a soul tie it was the enemy trying to destroy her life and to keep me out of my destiny that's exactly what it was she said i'm going back i love him and i'm going back and she said we'll talk about maybe making a way for you to go and live in columbus if that's what you want to do but she said i'm going back and i said mama if we go back to him i don't want to live i mean i was pulling out all of sympathy stuff you know i said i'm going to ask the lord i'm going to pray she knew that i prayed i'm going to pray that he will that i'll die i don't want to live because i don't want to live if i can't go to church and serve the lord and i don't want to live if i have to live my whole life watching you be beat this way this is not what i want and she was silent and she put me we got in the car and we started and she never said a word and all this time i my chest is beating my heart is beating in my chest and i think that i'm fixing to see the apartments i think that we're heading back i'm not even paying attention and i'm just crying just really just sobbing thinking about going back to that and all of a sudden i look up get my tears wiped off or whatever and i look up and i see a sign that said so many miles to columbus georgia she never even told me that she changed her mind she just changed her mind and she was free from that forever now i want you to know something it wasn't the best situation but god wanted us out of that look at the bird god wanted us out of that i can't help but wonder if i'm supposed to tell the story about the dove do you all remember the story some of you remember the story about the dove there was a dove that came and laid little branches on my windowsill when we were living down there in brunswick he visited me every day and he brought little little uh sticks with no little branches just straight little sticks he brought and he lay them there one one on the first day he laid a little stick there and then he was gone and the next day i went back he brought another stick and laid it there and and before it was over you've heard me tell this some of you have before it was over he had laid seven sticks one two three four five six seven and he never came back again and the lord said write it down you're going to remember that one day years later i began to hear a message and all seemed like everything for weeks i would listen to tapes every day and it seemed like everything i could hear was brother braham saying 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 i said i don't know that's what it is but god was somehow getting me ready for something maybe maybe there's somebody listening to this on a stream or something and you're living under condemnation of a divorce and and the enemy is telling you that you're not good enough or or that god can't bless you or help you because there's a mark like that on your life well i want you to know that's not the god i serve there is a divorce is not an unpardonable sin we don't believe in it and we're pretty strict on our teaching scripturally for remarriage but i want you to know my mama had a better life by herself than she had in that abuse and it wasn't easy it wasn't easy but we made it because of the grace of god i don't know why i'm on that but god knows why don't you let anything hang over you to keep you from your destiny [Applause] god has a plan oh i felt something then hallelujah thank you jesus he's got a plan for your life when the church shall be completely delivered that's when the church shall be completely delivered when everything comes under the blood when you're all of that all of that when everything is brought under the blood brought in submission or submissive to the kingdom of god then there'll be great real real deliverance anybody still with me i know it's late i want to read another quote i love this one from total deliverance it's actually the next paragraph i've preached this many times jesus paragraph 87 jesus was completely totally man anybody listening i know you're weary i i i can understand he could cry like a man he could eat like a man he could be tired like a man he was completely totally man in his physical being and in his spirit [Music] he was completely totally god so he made his flesh submissive to the spirit that was in him why would he do such a thing as your example as my example so he made his flesh submissive to the spirit that was in him you see he was tempted in all manners like we are he was a man not an angel he was a man he had desires and temptations just like we do how many of you know that's just what the bible said the bible said he did he was a man not an angel above temptation hebrews 1 said that he was hebrews 1 4 he was made lower than the angels he was a man he was man completely man that god took a complete man to bring total deliverance and he filled him with his spirit the holy ghost was in him without measure he was tempted like we are like we were and he was completely god he proved it when he raised from the dead or when he raised the dead when he stopped nature the roaring seas and the mighty winds are you still here when he spoke to the trees and so forth they obeyed him he was god inside and he could have been man for he was man but he totally and completely delivered himself as a man he completely and totally he totally and completely delivered himself as a man into the hands of god that's right brother steve for the service of god amen i know somebody's thinking well that was jesus you know you don't understand he became what you are so that you can become what he was the fallen the the the son of god became a son of man that we the fallen sons of men might become the sons of god for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god he totally and completely thanks david he totally and completely delivered himself as a man into the hands of god for the service of god now i don't know if that's sparking anything in you but it sparks me because that's part of my destiny remember when you hear a word and it quickens inside of you that's god letting you know that's a part of your calling that's a part of your destiny sister anna miller that little note you sent about something you were going through and listening to there's a sermon you were listening to and you felt identified you're you're trying to get your self around it your head around it i hope i'm not saying something wrong and and all of a sudden there could come to a certain part in that and there was a word that went out on that tape and something inter-identified with that he said we're a part of that we don't live by feelings but god gives us those things i feel quicken when i read this he said delivered himself totally completely as a man into the hands of god for the service of god wouldn't that be wonderful if every man and every woman here this morning and under the sound of my voice would make such a commitment i want it all under the blood i want it all under the blood i want to submit totally all that i am as a man all that you may be as a woman we want to give all of that to god paragraph 88 i'm okay i didn't fall [Music] he is our example we are men and women we're also christians if he's our example let us completely deliver ourselves into the hands of the holy ghost that we might be subjects of the kingdom of god [Music] he was totally man he was totally god but he surrendered his natural parts his physical parts his own thinking his own doing his own cares and i do only that which pleases the father you think that he was the only one that can have that kind of covenant i'm telling you he had it so that you could have it he committed himself that way so that you and i would find strength to commit ourselves that way amen there you are totally delivered from human beings the priests come to him the great men and said rabbi so-and-so and tried to bribe him into their affiliations and denominations but he was totally delivered because he trusted in god anybody with me in a message how can i overcome can you take a little bit more [Music] you see some folks said they drove was it seven hours or eight hours eight hours to be in one service shouldn't i give them a little bit more for making a sacrifice like that paragraph 104 how can i overcome look temptation was for him you know that the bible said he was tempted in all points like we are yet without sin tempted by drinking oh i love this quote this makes the religious choke hey they can't imagine jesus passing the bar and feeling a temptation he was tempted by oh let's don't leave this out he was tempted by drinking he was tempted by women i listened one time to a preacher trying to explain that jesus was a sexual asexual meaning neither male nor female so he had no he had no a pull toward sexual things freakish it's freakish he was tempted by drinking tempted by women tempted by everything that could be tempted by he was tempted by everything that we are he was a man and yet you couldn't put a mark on him yes sir overcome here is something so important to remember overcome means maybe you think overcome means to never be tempted then jesus was not an overcomer the real definition the prophet gave us of being overcome uh uh is to overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks now we're not all overcoming because sometimes he slips in we don't recognize him we start dealing with things around here and there's always some people that say oh really i didn't even know anything like that was going on well one of two things is true you're not here enough so you're not really connected to the body and you don't know what's going on or you're not recognizing the enemy in all of his tricks don't be discouraged don't be condemned by it just keep your eyes open lots of people say there is no devil it's just a thought don't you believe that there's a real devil he's just as real as you are anybody a real devil and you must recognize him real you must know he's the devil then the same time you you recognize him and know that he's the devil he's against you then to overcome you must recognize oh [Music] we must seem like silly people around here to get excited about something like this you recognize him and know that he's the devil and he's against you then to overcome you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is [Music] there it is kendra i loved i loved seeing your hand like that i loved it it touched my heart you must recognize that the god in you is greater and mightier than he is that the one that's in you has already [Music] already overcome him you see this is the best step i know toward total deliverance is to understand that he has already delivered us we just have to win this yes hey somebody said but what about the alcohol you'll win it here what the world are you trying to say that's where the greatest battle ever fault is you quit telling yourself you deserve something you've been through so much you need a release you need to relax you need something like that come on now you find yourself in bondage because you made an excuse that battle is one right there pornography the battle of overcoming pornography this one right there right there same same lie i need a release i i need to relax i i need all those endorphins come on just be real i've been up all night i've been working hard my wife is busy my wife's too tired she always has a headache you need to man up [Music] you need to fall at the cross you need to understand that battle is one right there it's one right there and any any lady any woman under that same thing it's wrong for us to think that only men fight the pornography battle it's wrong for us to think such a thing as that it's wrong for us to think that only men abuse their wives i want you to know there are men who have been terribly abused by wives some say i couldn't believe physically oh yes and it wasn't because the man couldn't overcome the woman it's because he chose not to it's because he stood there and let her beat him i want you to know i love my wife but she ain't gonna let me whoop her and i ain't gonna let her whoop me that reminded me of something mama used to say you'll never get too big for me to whoop you she was my mama she said i'll wait you go to bed at night and tie you to the bed and whoop you she didn't but i knew she would i remember the one time i picked up the phone and told her i was calling 911 she said you better hope they're on the front porch out there [Music] because by the time they get here i'm gonna give you something worth calling them for that's not funny the god in you is greater and mightier than that enemy is that the one that's in you has already overcome him and i want you to read that i ain't going to read it and [Music] not because you're a good bush [Music] not because you're different than any other bush it's the one that lives inside of you that makes you holy it's the one inside of you that makes you an overcomer you got to just make up your mind to drop your hoe [Music] he'll drive a man back to the computer before this day is over unless he makes up his mind and for you for those young men around the world that think marriage fixes that addiction it certainly does not it destroys marriages it destroys lives because no godly woman can keep up with that kind of stuff come on hideous you're more than a match for him by the grace of god there's real overcoming when you recognize there's real overcoming when you recognize total deliverance when you get under the blood there's real overcoming when you recognize a total deliverance paragraph 53 we might stop i can't believe it but we mine and the member of the church he's called to be a member of this certain group then he would not compromise if the church believes that we should not gamble then the members should never touch a deck of cards we don't believe in drinking he should turn his head completely from drinking because you never know who you're going to run into if we do not believe in gambling or smoking the member this church should never touch such a thing god gives complete deliverance he'll do it if we'll completely surrender ourselves to him quit making excuses for herself and god can live in us if we will completely deliver wait a minute he will do it if we'll completely surrender ourselves to him if if we will completely deliver ourselves into his hand then god can live in us christ the hope of glory he can reflect himself from us as we get ourselves out of the way then reid our thoughts are brother branham knew where the battle was won he knew where it was one could you imagine christ smoking a cigar brother daniel i i've been i've been an invited announced speaker in conferences in the last years and offered a cigar in the green room before i went to speak to a pentecostal charismatic conference i said something's bad wrong up in this place they sometimes had wine on the table and whispered quietly if you needed something harder they could get that too the church is in a mess the church world's in a mess i'm telling you right now she's in a mess if your spirit is part of can you imagine christ smoking a cigar could you imagine christ drinking or playing cards playing a little poker with his friends on sunday night he said then if your spirit is part of his spirit i want you to notice the reference to spirit here if your spirit is part of his spirit he wants it to be upon your confession but you permit the devil to come in and take over but you permit the devil to come in and take over and all the time in your heart way down deep you know you're wrong when you do those things well that's holiness preaching i believe it and when one member would talk against the other member yeah he puts it in the same category with smoking drinking and poker talking about your brother and sister running them down with no intention of helping them up you're commanded to pray for one another not to talk against one another but to love one another and if someone is down let's pick him up help him help him that's good that's the word let's read on now that makes us a unified group of believers oh god that's what we want here now when we don't obey that and we don't obey god and we displease god and therefore our church our people cannot prosper the church cannot go on it's because we're disunified together disunified together as jesus said a little leaven leaven's alone being unified knowing that we all struggle but we're all desiring to please him and moving in the right direction setting the best example that we know to set because the world is watching us anybody with me let me read one more verse and we're done ii corinthians chapter 1 verse 9 and 10 but we have the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves but in god which raiseth the dead who delivered us from so great a death [Music] and doth deliver in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us in the amplified it says for it is he who rescued and saved us from a perilous death verse 10 and he will still rescue and save us he did he did and he will he did save us and he will save us he did deliver us and he will deliver us he will still rescue and save us in and on him we have set our hope our joyful and confident expectation that he will again deliver us from danger and destruction and do what draw us to himself the greek word is sozo and it doesn't mean partial salvation sozo means complete total salvation like what we were reading about when we started here body soul and spirit it's a complete salvation it's a complete deliverance now here's what a lot of people don't quite understand and we'll pick this up tuesday night and that is deliverance and salvation is a progressive work but it is a total work it is a complete work and what we mean by that it's found in scripture and we'll go over those scriptures tuesday night our spirit has been i know there's other thoughts so if you're one of those our soul you can say our soul our spirit has been saved our soul is being saved that's our mind our will and our emotions we're still working on those he's still working on those come on that's not an excuse to continue to sin but it's a grace that says i will help you with your emotion i will help you with your stuff i'll bring you out from under the condemnation of your bad decisions in the past and let you be clean and clear before me not a sinner saved by grace but one who was a sinner old identity o creation now saved by grace new identity a new creation in christ all together isn't that what the scripture teaches so our spirit has been saved our soul is being saved as our mind is being renewed now that's a process it's a continual cycle and our body we have the promise that our body shall be saved our spirit is delivered our soul is being delivered mind will and emotions our body will one day be delivered from corruption into incur into incorruption do you believe that i want the musicians to come god bless you as you come i want you to play something softly i'm waiting on you to start playing something softly i want to share something with you as we close i thought maybe i wouldn't but this morning but save it but i think i will [Music] i want to read you a portion of a vision it's called the great divide and it is transvision number seven took place in january of 1998 you say well couldn't possibly have any relevance it does [Music] in january of 1998 we were worshiping the lord the seventh transvision came our church and ministry had gone through a very difficult time the previous year and we were pressing in to take hold of the promise that god had made in a vision in another vision that came at the end of 1996 we had been forewarned concerning the waters of separation that would flow among us we were still reeling from their effects and grieving the loss of relationships that had ended painfully in spite of the sadness i was filled with a sense of hope and destiny for many reasons one of which was the fact that god had brought a beautiful bride into my life and together we would face the unfolding plan for our future it was also a time of fresh visitation in our services there was a sense of importance in our being gathered together that night how many of you remember being there that night let me see the hands of those of you that were there there was a sense of importance about being gathered together that night the lord had spoken to us about the necessity of creating the right atmosphere with our worship and we were pouring out our hearts to him in song and i could both feel and hear the lord beckoning me i willingly went with him into the realm of the spirit and saw before me a beautiful river covered in a rising mist and even through the mist i could see the river bottom as it was not very deep a kind angel stepped up and said only a few have ever been called to this place i asked where is this place his answer seemed a bit strange if you always know where each journey will lead fear will attack your faith it is the great divide he added soon many will stand where only a few have previously stood across the misty river is the throne room of the most high god he further explained it as the seat of god and the throne from which the bloody lamb stepped forth he also said all who stand before this throne can say that they have seen the fullness of god his word seemed grand and a bit strange to me but i was filled with a longing to stand before the throne of god that i had never known before the mist was thickening and rising higher as we stood on the bank as though protecting what was on the other shore the angel said to me do not fear storms often arise in the middle of the river in the place where the waters run cold many have been called this far to cross this river but have turned back when they face the blackness of the storms remember many are called but only a few are chosen i began pleading my case before this angel in this holy atmosphere i quickly realized that i was still carrying hurt and unhealed wounds from what we had gone through in the church i explained my weariness and loss and expressed the fear that had made it difficult for me to go forward you must run on anyway he boldly said i asked about some of my companions who had become wounded in the fight and a few that appeared to be utterly defeated he said that not one would be lost from god's hand and for anyone who laid down their sword there would be three or more raised up to take their place he also said that a clear revelation of god's glory would be imparted and a perfect understanding of his person and character as well as revelatory truths would flow from his throne the bride was being summoned to the throne room of the lamb he was now standing on the other side of the river beckoning me to follow he explained that we were being summoned to the throne room on top of the mountain of god and across the wide river i remember thinking it sounded strange a river on top of a mountain but understood that this language was not to be contemplated with an earthly perspective but with spiritual insight zion the highest spiritual place represents the throne of god the abode of the fullness of his presence before this throne we experience more of the measure of his presence than angels have previously brought to us and this full manifested glory requires a protocol of reverence and deep respect the angel said that in order for us to move to the throne there would be other spiritual dimensions through which we must make our way the initial throme room visitation will unfold to you in three parts you will not be allowed to go the entire way the first time as there is a spiritual conditioning necessary to become acclimated to walking in these higher realms of glory you must first experience the full release of your earthly body on your next visit you'll be guided across the great divide to the far shore of the river from there you'll catch your first glimpse of the throne of the lamb you'll be permitted to come close enough to the throne to worship he further explained that after the third visit i would be sent back with a word of instruction that would be significant in bringing our entire fellowship into the throne room of the lamb i was overwhelmed with the desire to go immediately to the throne i wanted to experience the fullness of his person right then and there my gentle angel god reminded me that the holiness of god is revealed most often in threes and that i must remain patient the angel reminded me that i was living in a chosen generation that had previously received a significant word through a prophet he said that the full significance of what has been delivered in this past generation would be further understood by bridal throne room company now being prepared the angel told me to tell the people to prepare their hearts to stand in the throne room of god a new and more glorious strength the strength and might of the lord would be released to them this would cause a transition from knowing god to having the character of god to being like him every answer to every question lies in this place before his throne as we learn the bride's access to the throne room in the end time we'll be able to move in and out of this realm spiritually whenever a need arises she will then go forth with the covering of a sevenfold spirit of god as i narrated aloud to those in the room with me while my spirit was in trance a prophecy began to flow out of my mouth and i wanted to share with you the prophecy for such a time as this she is being summoned and esther feared for her life to stand before the king so will my wife come before my throne with fear and trembling and reverence but she will see my favor extended to her says the lord i will visit you according to my will and you will know that i have not forsaken this city of refuge neither my house of deliverance but from this place will i send forth a word to my people that will inspire and call her forth because of this work my fivefold ministry around the world will be inspired to stand with a greater anointing and an authority to do my last work in the earth for i am god and i would say unto thee that i have not stumbled at the words of evil men but i have counted them as nothing for i am god and i cannot lie and that which i have spoken i will surely bring to pass for yea and behold the best is yet to come for i have indeed saved the finest wine that supernatural wine of god's spoken word for this hour your lips have never tasted what i have reserved for you in the last hour i will bring forth my people to hear the word that i will put in my servants heart they will come again from the north and the south and the east and the west and i will manifest my presence and i would say unto thee i will give thee that which i have put in thine heart i will give it to you and you will build the very place that i have ordained wait on me saith the lord for i have not forsaken i have not turned my back on that which i have spoken though it tarry wait for it it will surely come to pass and you will know that i am god i want to give god praise let's stand together [Applause] that the lamb may receive the reward for his suffering that lamb may receive the reward through me that belongs [Music] hallelujah may receive the reward through me hallelujah [Music] hallelujah [Music] [Music] we love jesus [Music] [Music] we sing hallelujah [Music] [Music] may receive his reward for his offering that the lamb may receive is [Music] [Music] we surrender our lives we sing hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] that the lamb may receive his reward [Music] through me that the lamb may receive [Music] his reward for his suffering [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] lead us in something else oh jesus we've come to worship you lord now again [Music] to exalt your name and thank you for what you're doing in our lives stir the standing waters of my soul [Music] and merge me with your river [Music] which brings life yes lord yes lord i don't have all the right words to say that will provoke [Music] on me any more than you all ready so won't you come and come like you promised and pour out your spirit pour out your spirit and come [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] overcome the darkness of my night thank you jesus yes jesus be the strength of my life [Music] reaching past my hiding pass and reach beyond all my running [Music] and come like you promised [Music] pour out your spirits [Music] [Applause] [Music] still [Music] spirit [Music] like [Music] me oh [Music] [Music] down [Music] who you are [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] come like [Music] [Music] and come like you promised [Music] come and come like you promised [Applause] [Music] [Music] me down to embarrass me [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] you are fierce like no other you violently chase [Music] [Applause] [Music] like your father [Music] come like won't you just [Music] yet a little war going on in the atmosphere and you know i know what that's about you do too the enemy he does not like to be exposed and he does not want to turn loose if he places something on you some condemnation some guilt something that he can keep pressing that same button over and over again he does not want you to come to the place where you realize what he's doing because when you do you've overcome when you're able to recognize the enemy in all of his tricks you're already an overcomer that's what we read today and i just sense that i'm not trying to make something out of this service just whatever god wants is all right with us we can go now it's all right we've had we've had plenty of church but i just feel this just a little bit of war you're struggling and i don't want you to leave in that turmoil if you must go you're certainly dismissed you certainly can leave

deliverance that's needed here and i'm not i don't have much strength left so i'm calling on this body and this is the the holy ghost has called out some things and there's there's a list longer but i believe that uh if we'll bind together just now our sister can go free she does not have to be bound and she doesn't need your sympathy she needs somebody to speak deliverance into her life and i know that god is able to do it this is serious business and we're going to handle it in a serious way i want you to send your faith this way you you that are standing around that's wonderful but you don't have to move you can put your faith right here you can point your hand in this direction and we can believe the lord you know there comes a time where we've just got to be honest with god and i believe that her time has come now she has to just be honest with him and it doesn't matter what you think about her what matters is what god thinks about her and he calls her his own but it's time that she walked in deliverance and freedom and i want you to agree with me right now as that you all can sing that or something else or whatever you want to do you keep the music moving not because we have to have music but it keeps stirring the anointing in us and we're just going to keep praying for a little while longer and believe god but i want to tell you something this is a big need today it's a big need it's serious and only the lord can bring really the deliverance that's needed but he can if she's willing to cooperate with god he'll do his part i know he will so just reach your faith this way and begin to pray for our sister right now just ask the lord to set her free from the top of her head to the soles of her feet she's not the only one that needs to be honest with herself there's others that just need to be real honest about who you really are [Music] we're living in an hour right now that it's just kind of a serious season and i hear i hear things coming out of people's mouth that i know there's no more the truth and the man is in the moon we've got to be careful what we say we've got to speak the truth we don't have to embellish we don't have to exaggerate we don't have to add we don't have to twist details to make us look better we just got to be real in the presence of god if you find yourself falling into that trap repent of that today right where you are lord forgive me i don't want to add details i don't want to embelli i don't want to twist things to make me look better i want to be pure and holy and delivered and set free and little seeds planted i don't want to be somebody planting negative seeds in other people's lives about somebody else so let us all as we pray for our sister let's all also be honest with ourselves and if we can't tell the truth we should just shut up we should just be quiet don't talk just cause you know so much don't mean you have to talk so much how many of you know there comes a time where we just ought to be quiet amen amen if we can't tell the whole truth just be quiet now reach your faith this way saints and let's ask the lord to have his way and touch our sister halab lord this is your child lift up your faith lift up your voice let us believe the lord let us believe the lord today in the name of jesus in the name of jesus we stand against the wiles of the enemy that have made their move toward this that belongs to god and she has yielded to it she's given in to it she's found herself in the ditch with it but lord if you can come today and give her the victory lord as she lays it out before you [Music] this is [Music] storming the gates of them [Music] in the gates [Music] your voice and sing for joy grab your hands make a joyful noise [Music] worship is the way that the
