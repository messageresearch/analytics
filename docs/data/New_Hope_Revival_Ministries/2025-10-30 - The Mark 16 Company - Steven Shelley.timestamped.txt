[0:00] to do his will to will his will not my
[0:05] will his will. How is it accomplished?
[0:08] By the Mark 16 company. There have been
[0:11] Mark 16 companies, groups of men and
[0:13] women from the time of the day of
[0:16] Pentecost, Shàuote all the way through.
[0:19] They've been on the earth uh through all
[0:21] the darkest ages through every one of
[0:23] the seven church ages. God has not left
[0:26] himself without a witness or without a
[0:28] Mark 16 company of people but the
[0:31] prophesied
[0:33] the prophesied pre-planned elected
[0:36] predestinated Mark 16 company OF FULLY
[0:41] ADOPTED sons could not have come forth
[0:44] in Ephesus to the Ephesian church age or
[0:47] in the Philadelphia church age. They
[0:50] could only be raised up, that manchild
[0:53] company could only be raised up in the
[0:56] last of the last days. As Leodysia, the
[1:00] seventh church age is coming to a close
[1:03] &gt;&gt; and a bride is getting her marching
[1:05] orders.
[1:06] &gt;&gt; And once again, we find ourselves in a
[1:09] lapover age.
[1:11] &gt;&gt; The closing hours of Leodysia around us.
[1:14] And yet there's an invitation to a bride
[1:17] to become a wife.
[1:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:20] &gt;&gt; We're no longer just to be the
[1:22] espouseed.
[1:24] &gt;&gt; We're to be the demonstrators.
[1:28] &gt;&gt; The provers of the resurrection.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; He's depending on us. You know why God's
[1:34] not working with you confirming his
[1:36] resurrection? Because you're not working
[1:37] with him.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; It's real simple. If I'm not working
[1:40] with him, he's not working with me.
[1:43] Well, how do I work with him? You
[1:44] believe what you say.
[1:47] You say what he said
[1:49] &gt;&gt; and you believe it when it comes out of
[1:51] your mouth.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; And and and then you ask, "Well, what if
[1:53] I don't believe it the first time I say
[1:55] it?" You already know the answer to
[1:56] that. Brother Brandham gave us the
[1:57] answer to that. He said, "You just keep
[1:59] saying it until YOU BELIEVE IT. I AM
[2:01] HEALED. I AM HEALED. I am healed. I am
[2:04] healed." Hallelujah. [screaming]
[2:06] &gt;&gt; I am healed.
[2:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Before we can even get a
[2:13] grasp of a restoration back to Mark 16,
[2:17] God's already saying to us in the same
[2:20] book, in the same message, in the SAME
[2:22] BIBLE, THAT WE NOT ONLY NEED TO GO BACK
[2:25] to to the same power and authority of
[2:27] Mark 16, but that we're actually
[2:29] supposed TO OPERATE IN ANOTHER PORTION
[2:32] OF THAT,
[2:33] &gt;&gt; AN ADDITIONAL OUTPOURING OF THAT. We
[2:37] call it from the third seal, a bride's
[2:40] revival.
[2:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; WHERE HE TELLS US THERE'S revivals here,
[2:44] there's revivals there. The churches
[2:46] have burned out on revival, but the
[2:48] bride has never had a revival yet.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; ANOTHER TYPE OF NOT ONLY RESTORATION,
[2:57] but restitution. IT'S ALSO A TYPE OF THE
[3:01] SPIRIT THAT WAS ON Moses being
[3:04] multiplied
[3:05] and falling on 70 more.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; It's also a type of the day of Pentecost
[3:12] when the same LIFE THAT WAS IN CHRIST
[3:14] JESUS NOW POURS OUT ON 120
[3:18] &gt;&gt; WHO STUMBLE OUT INTO THE STREETS AND
[3:19] MAKE THOUSANDS.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; You see, a lot of people are convinced
[3:25] that these things diminish.
[3:28] Uh-huh.
[3:28] &gt;&gt; Because darkness increases.
[3:31] &gt;&gt; If the if the world is getting darker
[3:35] and the church is getting looser, then
[3:38] the bride ought to be getting brighter
[3:41] and operating in more power and more
[3:44] authority to get out of here.
[3:47] &gt;&gt; God didn't send Elijah back.
[3:50] Amen.
[3:51] &gt;&gt; HE TOOK HIM OFF THE scene
[3:53] &gt;&gt; because he WAS GOING TO SEND A DOUBLE
[3:55] PORTION OF THAT SPIRIT
[3:56] &gt;&gt; on Elisha. [screaming]
[3:58] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[4:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[4:01] &gt;&gt; And in THE SAME MANNER, THE CORPORAL
[4:03] BODY OF JESUS CHRIST DIDN'T COME BACK
[4:05] after it was ascending here when we were
[4:08] reading about it earlier,
[4:10] &gt;&gt; BUT THE SAME SPIRIT THAT WAS IN HIM,
[4:14] &gt;&gt; it came back.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing?
[4:18] &gt;&gt; Fell on 120. we said a moment AGO THAT
[4:20] QUICKLY BECAME THOUSANDS. SO, IT'S NOT
[4:23] THE PHYSICAL return of a body, a man
[4:26] that we're looking for, but it's a
[4:29] fulfillment, a full installment, a
[4:31] completion of everything THAT WE SAW
[4:35] DEMONSTRATED in that life. YOU SEE, A
[4:38] WAVE SHEATH OFFERING IS THAT a wave
[4:41] sheath offering. Someone has to come to
[4:44] maturity FIRST TO ENCOURAGE US THAT
[4:49] THERE WILL BE A FURTHERANCE OF THE
[4:51] MATURITY IN THE HARVEST.
[4:54] &gt;&gt; And this time it won't be one stalk.
[4:58] It's the WHOLE FIELD.
[5:00] &gt;&gt; IT'S THE WHOLE FIELD.
[5:04] &gt;&gt; NOW THAT IS WHAT HE SAID.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; Why not now?
[5:09] &gt;&gt; Why not me?
[5:11] WHY NOT US?
[5:13] &gt;&gt; LET'S GET HER DONE AND GET OUT OF HERE
[5:18] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE IS A LAND.
[5:21] &gt;&gt; THERE IS A [screaming] LAND.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; Glory be to God.
