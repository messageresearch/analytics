TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] there's a promised land untouched by a man prepared for the safe and blessed a city built for a square far away somewhere has a home for the saints to rest so many have tried but they couldn't describe all the beauties on that bright shore forts never entered into the heights of me what the father has in store well i can sing about heaven for a million years never get the story told but the jasper was in the gates of pearl and the streets made up here gold he forgot the revelator in a heavenly vision could never really say what he saw and i could sing about heaven for a million years still not i could never tell [Music] pure and sweet and it flows by the tree of life on its way to the crystal sea and the precious stones that the walls rest on are of twelve different times the night will cease for the prince of peace is the life that ever shies well i can sing about heaven for a million years never get the story told jasper walls and the gates of earth and the streets made up here gore even got the revelator in a heavenly vision he'd never really say what he saw and i could sing about heaven for a million years still i could never tell it all even shot the revelator in the heavenly vision could never really say what he saw and i could sing about heaven for a million years still i could never tell it all [Music]
