[47:23] Adelaide all
[47:25] right so Adelaide we want to pray for
[47:27] her that all of these spots will
[47:30] disappear and there'll be no lingering
[47:32] effects of them I'd like to give a
[47:35] testimony
[47:37] today most of you know that once a year
[47:41] we go and we get a beef from my
[47:43] father-in-law and we put it in the
[47:45] freezer and so that means since we were
[47:47] just there that means the freezer is
[47:49] full God is good well I went to the
[47:52] freezer Josiah came to bring something
[47:55] back to my house the other day and we
[47:56] were talking about how we stay hydrated
[47:59] and I was telling him what I use and I
[48:02] remembered that I needed to get some of
[48:04] these little tablets out of the freezer
[48:06] that have been uh put there for
[48:08] preservations for times that I need them
[48:11] and when I got in the freezer the light
[48:13] didn't come on it has a beautiful LED
[48:16] light
[48:17] that and I when I got in the freezer and
[48:19] the light wasn't on I said to my wife
[48:22] what happened to the light of the
[48:23] freezer she said what light
[48:30] light well I know there's a light in it
[48:33] well then I begin to think about how
[48:35] that she told me that the little Robo
[48:37] vacuum wasn't charging and she thought
[48:39] it needed a new battery well I began to
[48:43] investigate and realize that there was
[48:45] no power on any of the outlets in the
[48:47] room where the freezer was now thanks be
[48:51] to God the strawberries was the only
[48:53] thing that I noticed that had started
[48:55] defrosting and they were on the door so
[48:57] the door is the first to start
[48:59] defrosting nothing else defrosted I was
[49:02] able to quickly go to the garage and get
[49:04] a cord and reroute the freezer so that
[49:07] it was immediately plugged back in but I
[49:10] still had a problem so I I have a little
[49:13] tester and I plugged it into the outlets
[49:15] in that room and it read 30 volts of
[49:18] electricity anybody that knows anything
[49:20] about electricity it should be around
[49:23] 120 so I went to another room 124 every
[49:27] receptacle in that room 30 a 30 30 volts
[49:33] the light still worked well I remembered
[49:36] that all of the the way that it was
[49:38] wired the electricity went to the light
[49:41] and then down to the receptacles that's
[49:44] the way the house was wired and so
[49:46] yesterday as I started looking for the
[49:48] problem I changed the breaker went in
[49:50] the Attic looking for the problem and
[49:53] then I went first to the receptacle the
[49:56] free Freer was plugged in thinking it
[49:58] pulled the most voltage maybe it had
[50:00] melted it was fine so then I went to
[50:03] another receptacle and I found that it
[50:06] had
[50:08] melted the side of the if you were to
[50:10] look at this you would see that the side
[50:12] of this receptacle you see that paint it
[50:15] came out of Charity's old room that
[50:18] receptacle was
[50:19] melted well when I pulled this
[50:21] receptacle out
[50:24] apparently any of you that have ever
[50:26] done one of the receptacles apparently
[50:28] the electrician forgot to tighten down
[50:30] one of these little screws that are on
[50:33] the side of the
[50:35] receptical and so now we've lived in
[50:37] this home for 20 almost 24 years just
[50:40] over 23 and so that has arked now
[50:44] apparently for almost 23 years so that's
[50:48] another miracle that the house did not
[50:50] catch fire why did it not set the
[50:52] breaker off I do not know but it is the
[50:55] grace of God that I have a home that I
[50:58] still have a freezer full of food and I
[51:00] want to give God the praise for
[51:02] [Applause]
[51:09] it now just so you know I just did a
[51:13] little slinging at the electrician but I
[51:15] was the
[51:18] electrician so nobody can be blamed but
[51:21] me but I'm so thankful for the goodness
[51:24] of God he Is So Good Charity do you have
[51:28] that video ready to roll we want to show
[51:30] you a video today of how the Lord has
[51:34] blessed us this week we told you that
[51:37] the concrete was poured on Monday our
[51:40] brothers came down from Indiana and they
[51:43] poured this concrete for us and we want
[51:46] to show you this video if you'll pull
[51:48] the lights down brother Hawke did an
[51:50] amazing job putting with with the Drone
[51:53] and the camera and then putting this
[51:55] video together and we want you to see
[52:00] [Music]
[52:25] it
[52:28] [Music]
[53:35] isn't that
[53:39] exciting so then
[53:41] yesterday we started putting up a little
[53:43] framing
[53:45] yes so it's getting
[53:48] exciting there's the four wall of the
[53:51] bathroom all right isn't that so
[53:55] funen
[54:03] Nathan said that he and Luke bullied me
[54:05] into getting started
[54:08] yesterday so we went and got some Lumber
[54:10] and got started so we're excited to see
[54:14] how the Lord will provide for this and
[54:16] how that we can get it all put together
[54:18] and in his timing we'll have this place
[54:21] of Fellowship ready to gather together I
[54:24] mean I guess we could put tables and
[54:26] shars on the concrete and fellowship as
[54:28] it is now I will tell you you'll have to
[54:30] hold on to your plate and your napkin
[54:33] and probably your glass because it's a
[54:36] wind tunnel but we could still have
[54:38] Fellowship there God is so
[54:41] faithful uh we're going to receive the
[54:44] tithe and the offering Hannah and Olivia
[54:46] they tell me you girls have a song if
[54:49] you'll come and get ready we want to
[54:51] receive the tithe and the offering give
[54:53] is giving unto the Lord because he is
[54:56] the one who provides for us at the start
[55:00] he is the one anything that we have is
[55:02] because of
[55:04] him any any clothes that you have any
[55:08] house that you have any money that you
[55:10] have any food that you have it's because
[55:13] that he provided it for you we may think
[55:17] that it's because of our ability but
[55:19] even our abilities is because he gave it
[55:22] to us Amen brother Ellas will you and

[1:05:37] with us just so beautiful to have her
[1:05:40] and she's looking so good and I'm so
[1:05:44] thankful that God you know it's a long
[1:05:46] drive she's not able to be here with us
[1:05:49] that often but uh I'm so thankful that
[1:05:51] she chose this weekend to be here and uh
[1:05:55] well the ladies had a good time
[1:05:58] yesterday and uh when we got home to the
[1:06:01] house we had another another showing of
[1:06:05] all the gifts we all went into the den
[1:06:08] and and Jenna sat in the floor and
[1:06:10] showed us everything that you all had
[1:06:12] given and they're very thankful and I'm
[1:06:15] very thankful that you did and you you
[1:06:18] made us proud and uh I appreciate every
[1:06:22] effort that was made uh we just yeah we
[1:06:25] take it
[1:06:27] personal these are my young
[1:06:29] ons and we take it personal and we
[1:06:32] appreciate you for everything that you
[1:06:34] have done for them and we're looking
[1:06:36] forward yeah we're not hiding it we are
[1:06:39] looking forward to uh having a little
[1:06:43] one e even if it has to be a girl we are
[1:06:46] very happy there it's a either boy or
[1:06:50] girl and this time it's girl who knows
[1:06:54] what it'll be the next four or five six
[1:06:55] seven eight times we don't know it's
[1:06:57] just we have no way of knowing but God
[1:07:00] knows doesn't he I want you to turn this
[1:07:03] morning before you're seated you know
[1:07:05] always if you get weary all you have to
[1:07:07] do is sit down no one's going to feel
[1:07:09] hard at you but we have a tradition that
[1:07:12] when the word of God is read we try to
[1:07:14] show honor and respect to that brother
[1:07:17] brandham told us if the Queen of England
[1:07:19] we're not we're not from the United
[1:07:21] Kingdom but if the Queen of England were
[1:07:24] to walk in we would give her reverence
[1:07:27] you know I don't know I might struggle a
[1:07:29] little bit with the King but anyway I I
[1:07:31] I'd get up might take me a while to get
[1:07:33] up but uh you know we were in a
[1:07:36] situation we were not uh we certainly
[1:07:39] were not for for uh President Obama but
[1:07:42] we happened to be in a place where he
[1:07:44] was speaking and we gave him the same
[1:07:47] respect that we we gave to prime
[1:07:49] minister
[1:07:50] Netanyahu because of the office that he
[1:07:53] held and so when we have this precious
[1:07:57] word of God it's God in word form we
[1:08:01] have God in our hands when we hold this
[1:08:05] book it's the written record of who he
[1:08:07] is and we're blessed to give honor and
[1:08:10] respect to that before we read the
[1:08:12] scripture uh there if I don't do it now

[1:12:31] celebration they're they're spiritual
[1:12:33] enough to know that food can be very
[1:12:36] spiritual I make a good Jew don't I all
[1:12:40] right first John chapter 4 we're going
[1:12:44] to review a few verses here
[1:12:47] beloved let us
[1:12:50] love one another for love is of God and
[1:12:55] everyone that loveth is born of God and
[1:12:59] knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth
[1:13:04] not God for God is love may I just say
[1:13:08] that it's impossible to know God and not
[1:13:11] love because God is love he that loveth
[1:13:15] knoweth not God for God is love let's
[1:13:18] read on in this was manifested the love
[1:13:22] of God toward us because that God sent
[1:13:25] his only begotten son into the world
[1:13:29] that we might live through
[1:13:33] him here in is love not that we loved
[1:13:37] God but that he loved us and sent his
[1:13:41] son to be the
[1:13:43] propitiation for our sins and that is
[1:13:47] much more than a
[1:13:49] covering thank God we're not just
[1:13:51] covered our sins have been remitted by
[1:13:55] the blood of the Lamb he has become our
[1:13:58] perfect substitute beloved if God so
[1:14:01] loved us we also we ought also to love
[1:14:07] one another no man have seen God at any
[1:14:11] time if we love one another God dwelleth
[1:14:15] in us and his love is
[1:14:19] perfected in us it's in this verse that
[1:14:22] we get the phrase perfect love or
[1:14:27] perfected Love sometimes the prophet
[1:14:29] called it Divine love what we have come
[1:14:34] to understand is the word perfect there
[1:14:37] is a word that actually means
[1:14:40] matured so we are learning to love with
[1:14:44] a mature love which is an unconditional
[1:14:47] love it's the love that God has loved us
[1:14:50] with he didn't love us any less when we
[1:14:53] were unlovable
[1:14:55] he loved us the same and this is the
[1:14:57] kind of love that we're being called to
[1:14:59] in this hour as the bride of Christ now
[1:15:03] let's go on for just a few more verses
[1:15:05] hereby we know that we dwell in him and
[1:15:08] he in us because he ha given us of his
[1:15:14] Spirit as we have seen and do testify
[1:15:18] that the father sent the son to be the
[1:15:21] savior of the world whosoever shall
[1:15:24] confess
[1:15:25] that Jesus is the son of God God
[1:15:30] dwelleth in him and he in God he was
[1:15:35] more than a prophet he was more than a
[1:15:38] sage or a good teacher or a godly man he
[1:15:43] was the son of
[1:15:45] God he was the son of man he was the
[1:15:49] manifestation of God he is equal to all
[1:15:54] of the other manifestations of God he's
[1:15:57] not less than the father he is the
[1:16:00] father made flesh that's what the word
[1:16:03] says it doesn't matter what your church
[1:16:05] says that's what the Bible said you just
[1:16:08] can't deny that Jesus is God In the
[1:16:12] Flesh he created the
[1:16:15] womb Jesus created the womb that gave
[1:16:20] him birth how did he do that as God he
[1:16:23] did it as God I don't want to yell
[1:16:27] yet but you know this is such a
[1:16:29] foundation to stand on and we have known
[1:16:33] and believed the love that God hath to
[1:16:35] us H God is love and he that dwelleth in
[1:16:39] love dwelleth in God and God in him
[1:16:44] herein is our love made mature perfect
[1:16:49] complete that we may have boldness in
[1:16:52] the day of judgment because as he is
[1:16:55] so are we in this
[1:16:58] world there is no fear I want you to say
[1:17:01] no fear in love if fear is present love
[1:17:07] is
[1:17:08] withdrawing so we need to pull love back
[1:17:12] in so that fear will flee because there
[1:17:16] is no fear in the presence of love but
[1:17:19] perfect love mature love does what to
[1:17:22] fear It cast it out it can't stay fear
[1:17:27] and torment cannot stay where love is
[1:17:30] abounding because fear hath torment and
[1:17:33] I always ask this when I read the
[1:17:35] scripture who can testify of that who
[1:17:37] can say fear brings torment when you
[1:17:40] become fearful your mind is tormented
[1:17:43] you are tormented in your soul which is
[1:17:46] the mind and the will and the emotions
[1:17:49] he that fearth is not made mature is not
[1:17:54] made perfect is not made complete in
[1:17:57] love we're almost
[1:17:59] done we love
[1:18:01] him because not just because it's a
[1:18:05] smart thing to do we love him because he
[1:18:08] hath first loved us did you know you
[1:18:12] couldn't love him if he hadn't loved you
[1:18:15] first and you couldn't seek him if he
[1:18:18] hadn't sought you first you couldn't
[1:18:21] know him if he hadn't known you first my
[1:18:24] that's getting good we love him because
[1:18:27] he first loved us if a man say I love
[1:18:30] God and hateth his
[1:18:34] brother he's a liar for he that loveth
[1:18:37] not his brother whom he hath seen how
[1:18:41] can he love God whom he hath not seen
[1:18:44] one more verse and this commandment have
[1:18:47] we from him that he who loveth God
[1:18:51] loveth his brother also so let us be
[1:18:54] aware today that this is not a
[1:18:57] suggestion it's not just a good piece of
[1:19:00] advice it's a Commandment that if we
[1:19:03] love God we're going to have to love our
[1:19:06] brother we're going to have to love one
[1:19:09] another we're going to have to love the
[1:19:11] most
[1:19:13] unlovable this world is
[1:19:15] full of Untouchables Society likes to
[1:19:19] call them but our love has to be deep
[1:19:22] enough to reach even to them we'll never
[1:19:25] be able to love The Untouchables and the
[1:19:27] unlovables until we learn to love each
[1:19:29] other and I mean real love not not
[1:19:33] mushy you know sticky sweet I love you
[1:19:37] and then
[1:19:40] backstab father we thank you for your
[1:19:43] love it keeps us it sustains us it has
[1:19:47] redeemed us it is changing us every time
[1:19:53] we come into worship
[1:19:55] every time we come into your presence
[1:19:58] and your glory begins to move over our
[1:20:00] body over our mind over our inner being
[1:20:04] we are being changed from glory to glory
[1:20:08] I don't know how people survive who
[1:20:11] never make the effort to come into your
[1:20:14] presence Lord I Thank you that you have
[1:20:16] made the way you have opened up the door
[1:20:20] you have removed the veil and you have
[1:20:23] said come in I invite might you in
[1:20:26] there's no longer a veil to keep us out
[1:20:30] there's no longer cherub Beam with
[1:20:32] flaming sword to keep us out but now
[1:20:35] they stand guard to help push us in and
[1:20:39] so today because we have already been in
[1:20:42] your presence we will leave here higher
[1:20:45] than what we came in we will leave here
[1:20:48] closer to you than what we came in it
[1:20:50] doesn't matter how we feel we may
[1:20:53] ultimately feel the exact same way but
[1:20:56] your word said when we come into your
[1:20:59] presence we are changed and we just want
[1:21:01] to give you glory and honor for that
[1:21:04] promise and we believe it and we say in
[1:21:07] our hearts in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:09] Christ we say
[1:21:12] Amen you may be
[1:21:15] seated I want to share with you a
[1:21:17] quotation today from the message blind
[1:21:22] bardus I don't know if this is the
[1:21:25] the the blind bardus uh you know he told
[1:21:28] it many
[1:21:30] times and one time he's he's talking
[1:21:33] about uh Prince of the House of David
[1:21:35] the book and he talks about and you know
[1:21:39] I bring this out because I love
[1:21:42] it I love when we can see the humanity
[1:21:46] of one
[1:21:47] another and the Servants of the Lord are
[1:21:51] called but they're human and brother
[1:21:54] brandham is making a beautiful drama of
[1:21:57] this story and all of a sudden he says
[1:22:00] that blind bardus turned and saw the
[1:22:05] lamb but blind bmus was
[1:22:09] blind he said he saw a rock and he
[1:22:12] pulled himself up and sat down on that
[1:22:14] rock in other words we can get a little
[1:22:17] dramatic in our telling of something and
[1:22:19] miss a detail here but
[1:22:22] potentially a few seconds later
[1:22:25] the beggar who couldn't see the the
[1:22:28] blind man who couldn't see the lamb the
[1:22:31] blind man who couldn't see the rock just
[1:22:33] a few minutes later when he touched
[1:22:35] Jesus he saw everything aren't you glad
[1:22:39] for that in the message blind bardus
[1:22:42] paragraph 146 he said friends I'm not a
[1:22:46] little boy anymore or no more I've seen
[1:22:49] many a test but I've never seen nothing
[1:22:52] yet could over ride love it just takes
[1:22:58] everything out of the way love conquers
[1:23:02] wild animal love conquers it's just the
[1:23:06] most conquering force that there is
[1:23:11] because it's God God is love love is God
[1:23:15] and love is a conquering force can you
[1:23:18] say amen he said you know why I can help
[1:23:21] you it's because you love me and and
[1:23:24] this works with your pastor or your
[1:23:27] brother or your sister in Christ I can
[1:23:30] help you because you love me and you
[1:23:32] believe me you didn't believe me no
[1:23:33] matter what kind of works God would do
[1:23:36] by me or through me you still wouldn't
[1:23:38] get any benefit do you know that he said
[1:23:41] that's my success with the Lord the
[1:23:46] people love me and I love them now
[1:23:49] brother brandom is crediting the success
[1:23:53] of his ministry to this one thing
[1:23:56] love love remember the the the angel
[1:24:00] said if you can get the people to
[1:24:01] believe you nothing will stand before
[1:24:05] you not even cancer so believing is is
[1:24:09] is not just believing it's it's loving
[1:24:12] as well love is kind of the bond that's
[1:24:15] putting the faith in there he said the
[1:24:17] people love me and I love them and
[1:24:19] that's where the success comes from a
[1:24:22] and he goes on so if if you want to be
[1:24:25] successful in anything you do for the
[1:24:27] Lord you must love you receive love and
[1:24:32] you know there are those of us who
[1:24:34] struggle in receiving love I know people
[1:24:38] who who really struggle to say the words
[1:24:41] out loud to the Lord I love you
[1:24:45] Lord and you don't want to be critical
[1:24:47] of somebody like that because they're
[1:24:50] struggling with receiving love and when
[1:24:52] you struggle being
[1:24:55] loved it becomes automatic that you
[1:24:58] struggle expressing love but if you
[1:25:01] could catch a revelation today of how
[1:25:03] much he loves you with every shortcoming
[1:25:07] with every failure with every bump on
[1:25:09] your nose or wart on your
[1:25:13] elbow with with your with your crooked
[1:25:16] eyebrow with your Hang-Ups with your
[1:25:20] complexes he loves you you are valuable
[1:25:25] in his
[1:25:26] kingdom we know this and we quickly say
[1:25:30] Amen but to know it changes everything
[1:25:33] to really know it to really know that
[1:25:37] God loves you in your Uprising in your
[1:25:41] downfallen he loves you in your
[1:25:43] successes and he even loves you through
[1:25:46] your failures his love is not fickle
[1:25:50] it's not relative and it's not
[1:25:52] conditional he loves us
[1:25:56] unconditionally and because of that we
[1:25:59] learn to receive love and when we learn
[1:26:02] to receive love it's easier for us to
[1:26:05] give love and to express love is anybody
[1:26:08] with me and so if you can develop a
[1:26:11] relationship with the Lord where you can
[1:26:13] not only tell him that you love him but
[1:26:16] you can show him by the life that you
[1:26:19] live it becomes easier then to live a
[1:26:22] lifestyle of Love toward the brothers
[1:26:24] and sisters so it really goes back your
[1:26:28] ability to love one another as Christ
[1:26:31] has loved us it really goes back to an
[1:26:34] element of whether or not we can receive
[1:26:36] his love he's good to us folks he loves
[1:26:39] us you know there might be somebody
[1:26:42] watching in this service I I I just took
[1:26:45] a glance and we uh we we just greet all
[1:26:48] the saints who are streaming Southern
[1:26:51] Norway uh Indiana Morocco can you
[1:26:53] imagine
[1:26:55] someone's watching the service and does
[1:26:57] regularly from Morocco we send you our
[1:26:59] love across Indiana across the uh
[1:27:03] Netherlands we greet the Saints in India
[1:27:06] and and it just goes on and on and on
[1:27:09] and and we're so thankful for every
[1:27:11] person that that has a little part in in
[1:27:14] what God is doing in this hour I want to
[1:27:16] just move on in the message why are
[1:27:19] people so tossed about Jeffersonville he
[1:27:23] said brother
[1:27:24] let's get people inside the veil you
[1:27:29] want to know a little secret he said
[1:27:31] that's how I conquer wild animals that's
[1:27:34] how I conquer
[1:27:36] diseases is by
[1:27:38] love I'm telling you love must be a
[1:27:40] powerful force here it must be more than
[1:27:43] a warm and fuzzy
[1:27:45] emotion it it it it must be so powerful
[1:27:48] that it breaks through
[1:27:50] dimensions a and it reorders the laws of
[1:27:53] nature isn't that something and you know
[1:27:55] there's a millennium coming a thousand
[1:27:58] years of peace with the Lord Jesus
[1:28:00] Christ where the Bible tells us that the
[1:28:02] lion is going to lay down next to the
[1:28:04] lamb and a little child is going to play
[1:28:07] on the hole of an asp which is the most
[1:28:09] poison a snake in in Scripture A and A
[1:28:12] little child is going to lead them and
[1:28:15] so we know that God has power to conquer
[1:28:19] even the laws of nature the laws that he
[1:28:22] instituted and created in the beginning
[1:28:24] and brother brandom is talking to us
[1:28:26] here about the ability and we'll get to
[1:28:28] that in just a moment to conquer even
[1:28:30] wild animals who are ready to
[1:28:32] attack and it wasn't a rebuke you know
[1:28:34] we're Pentecostal uh by birth and we
[1:28:37] have some of us have come from
[1:28:39] Pentecostal denominations and therefore
[1:28:41] the first thing we do is
[1:28:44] rebuke so the way I was brought up if if
[1:28:48] if Hornets would have come against me I
[1:28:50] I'd have rebuked them that's what we
[1:28:53] were taught if the enemy comes you just
[1:28:56] I rebuke you go back where you come from
[1:28:59] you devil you're not going to sting me
[1:29:02] or or the bull that brother brandom
[1:29:04] talks about and we'll mention in a
[1:29:05] minute we would have said you know bull
[1:29:07] I rebuke you you you lay down there and
[1:29:10] leave me alone but he didn't teach us
[1:29:13] that our Victory comes by rebuke he
[1:29:16] tells us that our Victory comes by love
[1:29:19] and even diseases are conquered through
[1:29:23] love
[1:29:24] so when we're praying for one another if
[1:29:27] we can remember that love is an
[1:29:30] activator love activates faith and faith
[1:29:34] will bring healing and bring Miracles
[1:29:37] and bring signs and bring wonders if you
[1:29:39] believe that say amen amen he said the
[1:29:42] love of God constrains us to do such a
[1:29:45] thing come in the Veil come in the veil
[1:29:47] want you today while we bow our heads
[1:29:50] for a moment of prayer a and and he's
[1:29:52] coming to an end of the service he's
[1:29:54] about to pray for the sick and he's
[1:29:56] reminding people these things come by
[1:30:00] love so there must be Authority in
[1:30:05] love the ability to receive God's love
[1:30:09] and to and to use his love to let it
[1:30:12] flow through us like a pipeline it must
[1:30:15] bring an authority in the realm of the
[1:30:18] spirit are you following what I'm saying
[1:30:21] it it must bring a boost to our prayers
[1:30:24] love it must bring authority to the way
[1:30:28] that we deal with things in that other
[1:30:30] realm and in that other dimension so
[1:30:33] love transcends the dimension that we're
[1:30:36] operating in now the the realm of the
[1:30:39] natural love transcends the realm of the
[1:30:42] natural and it moves into the realm of
[1:30:45] the Supernatural and when the
[1:30:47] supernatural is activated by faith
[1:30:52] anything can has to die Anything Can
[1:30:57] Happen a little baby in a womb that no
[1:31:00] longer has a heartbeat we can testify to
[1:31:04] you today that when love activates
[1:31:07] through faith in that Realm of the
[1:31:09] supernatural it sends back answers to us
[1:31:12] it sends back Resurrection Life to us
[1:31:15] and we can testify that we have seen God
[1:31:18] bring Resurrection Life not every time
[1:31:21] but according to his will and his plan
[1:31:24] we have seen him bring Resurrection Life
[1:31:27] when the doctor said it's time now to to
[1:31:31] uh to eliminate what is left of this
[1:31:33] life and all of a sudden just before a
[1:31:37] mother's Faith would drop in there and
[1:31:39] she would say you better check again
[1:31:42] this has happened more than once around
[1:31:44] this body and and you better check one
[1:31:47] more time and then them go back and find
[1:31:51] that love and faith had trans ascended
[1:31:55] this natural realm had taken a hold of a
[1:31:57] promise in the Supernatural realm and
[1:32:00] had brought it back into manifestation
[1:32:02] now that's not
[1:32:04] deep that's how Faith Works you you you
[1:32:08] you may not even know how it works and
[1:32:09] you don't have to know how it works just
[1:32:11] use it we used to sing a song in
[1:32:14] Pentecost faith faith faith Just a
[1:32:16] Little Bit of Faith you don't have to
[1:32:18] have a whole lot you just use what
[1:32:21] you've got you exercise what God has
[1:32:24] placed in you because the Bible said to
[1:32:27] every man is given a Measure of Faith so
[1:32:30] you take the faith that God has given
[1:32:32] you and you use it and when you do it
[1:32:35] becomes
[1:32:37] multiplied now he goes on in gyrus and
[1:32:40] Divine Healing and yes I'm going to use
[1:32:43] uh several quotations this morning and
[1:32:46] and if you're offended I apologize for
[1:32:48] your offense but I tell you that there's
[1:32:51] I don't know of any Minister anywhere
[1:32:53] that doesn't quote
[1:32:54] somebody I just happen to quote somebody
[1:32:57] I have confidence in all right H in in
[1:33:00] in paragraph 40 uh of gyrus and Divine
[1:33:04] Healing he said last summer my yard
[1:33:06] needed mowing so bad and I couldn't know
[1:33:09] couldn't get nobody to mow it now that
[1:33:11] bothers
[1:33:16] me I'm not real good with mowing but I
[1:33:19] want you to know I'd have wanted to mow
[1:33:21] it if he needed his grass modow I'd have
[1:33:23] wanted to make sure it was done wouldn't
[1:33:25] you couldn't get nobody to mow it God
[1:33:28] had a lesson in it I guess and I was
[1:33:30] home on a little vacation and I two
[1:33:32] weeks I hadn't got out of the front yard
[1:33:34] with a little power mower put on my
[1:33:37] overalls and run out starting mow in the
[1:33:40] yard first thing you know a little power
[1:33:43] motor Mower and somebody come
[1:33:48] in I slip around the bat and change my
[1:33:51] clothes run in and pray for them them
[1:33:54] and then change again and go out
[1:33:58] remember one time he told us he kept a
[1:33:59] little Overcoat of some kind in the
[1:34:02] garage so he could throw it on because
[1:34:04] even if he was trying to mow the lawn or
[1:34:06] do something in the yard people would
[1:34:08] pull up ambulances would pull up to the
[1:34:11] front of the house and want him to pray
[1:34:12] for them and so he said I had to be
[1:34:14] ready at all times he said uh uh and I'd
[1:34:17] run in and pray for them and change
[1:34:19] again and been almost two weeks and the
[1:34:21] grass had growned up behind me and so I
[1:34:23] got around behind the house and where
[1:34:25] nobody could see me and and and I took
[1:34:28] off my overalls and Sho uh uh shoes my
[1:34:32] shirt was off real hot and I was mowing
[1:34:36] I'd forgot about a little old Martin box
[1:34:38] there that I had and there's a bunch of
[1:34:42] Hornets in there I don't know what you
[1:34:45] know about Hornets but that's a little
[1:34:47] more vicious than a
[1:34:49] wasp I want you to know when they move
[1:34:52] through the air you hear them
[1:34:56] that's what it sounds like they move
[1:34:59] with such swiftness and such Precision
[1:35:02] that you can hear them coming and when
[1:35:05] they swarm you have seen something if
[1:35:08] you've ever seen we used to have quite a
[1:35:10] few hornets nest here on the campground
[1:35:12] and if you've ever seen one and you've
[1:35:13] seen those Hornets move in and out you'd
[1:35:16] want to move out of the way and they're
[1:35:18] deadly they can be deadly if you get uh
[1:35:21] uh so many stings or certain situations
[1:35:24] where you could even lose your life he
[1:35:26] said I forgot about that little Martin
[1:35:28] box and there's a bunch of Hornets in
[1:35:29] there and I hid against that
[1:35:32] fence and I was covered over with
[1:35:36] Hornets in a few
[1:35:38] minutes just nothing on top here and the
[1:35:41] Hornets now little
[1:35:44] Hornets I love
[1:35:49] you come on folks that's a little
[1:35:52] abnormal
[1:35:54] that's not or remember remember I sister
[1:35:57] Joyce do you understand what I mean when
[1:35:59] I say I come from Pentecost and first
[1:36:01] thing we would have done was in the name
[1:36:03] of
[1:36:04] Jesus you foul
[1:36:07] Hornets go back where you come
[1:36:10] from brother Brandon wasn't trained that
[1:36:13] way he said now little Hornets I love
[1:36:19] you see you're reading ahead I don't
[1:36:22] want you kiss in
[1:36:25] me I want you to go right on back in
[1:36:28] your box where you
[1:36:30] belong cuz I'm God's servant and I'm
[1:36:34] praying for the sick people and this
[1:36:37] grass is growing up and I want you to
[1:36:39] get away from
[1:36:42] me and I'm not scared of you
[1:36:45] now because I ain't got time to fool
[1:36:50] you go right back in the box
[1:36:54] he said I just talked to them like that
[1:36:56] and I just kept on moving and God is my
[1:36:58] judge I'm going to let you know every
[1:37:01] one of them Hornets just line right up I
[1:37:05] just had a flashback to a cartoon I saw
[1:37:07] as a
[1:37:11] child and and I saw those hornets and
[1:37:14] they formed an arrow I don't know if you
[1:37:15] ever saw a cartoon like that they formed
[1:37:18] an
[1:37:19] arrow in the
[1:37:21] sky maybe that's kind of what it looked
[1:37:24] like that day he said I'm going to let
[1:37:26] you know that every one of them Hornets
[1:37:28] just lined up right like that and went
[1:37:31] right on back in that box just as pretty
[1:37:34] as they could go that's
[1:37:36] right now it wasn't
[1:37:40] rebuke it wasn't
[1:37:43] witchcraft somebody tell me what did the
[1:37:46] what did the work it was the
[1:37:49] projecting of love when love is
[1:37:53] projected Sovereign Grace which is the
[1:37:56] perfect will of God did you know that
[1:37:59] Sovereign Grace is the perfect will of
[1:38:02] God when you have encountered Sovereign
[1:38:05] Grace you have encountered the perfect
[1:38:07] will of God When Love is projected
[1:38:10] Sovereign Grace takes over and the will
[1:38:13] of God was not that brother brandham be
[1:38:16] be stung by a by a whole uh
[1:38:19] uh swarm or Hive I started to say her
[1:38:24] I don't think Hornets heard I think they
[1:38:26] swarm or Hive or something you know it
[1:38:29] was not God's will that he'd be
[1:38:31] overtaken that way and so love was
[1:38:35] projected and When Love Was projected
[1:38:38] The Sovereign Grace issued in the will
[1:38:40] of God now would you would you would you
[1:38:44] be an
[1:38:45] experiment would you take that out of
[1:38:48] here and try it now let me ask how many
[1:38:52] of you have ever tried it because you
[1:38:53] know this message you've heard this for
[1:38:55] years and years how many of you have
[1:38:57] ever tried something like that when you
[1:38:59] were in a situation and found that it
[1:39:01] worked I have when I heard him say that
[1:39:05] I thought to myself when some people
[1:39:07] hear things like that they think oh it's
[1:39:11] because he was a prophet when I hear
[1:39:14] things like that I think H if God did
[1:39:16] that for him he can do that for me
[1:39:19] that's how we're supposed to look at
[1:39:20] these things and so I've had to use that
[1:39:23] a few few times and God got me out of
[1:39:25] some pretty bad situations some of them
[1:39:28] weren't Hornets with wings some of them
[1:39:30] were Hornets with two legs and two
[1:39:33] arms remember when Paul said I fought
[1:39:35] those beasts at Ephesus he wasn't
[1:39:37] talking about lions tigers and bears he
[1:39:40] was talking about enemies that walk on
[1:39:41] two feet men can come to destroy you and
[1:39:45] love is the
[1:39:46] answer it's not rebuke and it's not even
[1:39:49] that pistol on your
[1:39:51] leg amen
[1:39:54] your answer is love and I'm not telling
[1:39:57] you that we think of that every time we
[1:40:00] should but we ought to become so used to
[1:40:03] what God has done in our life and the
[1:40:06] examples that he has showed us that we
[1:40:08] would be overcome overwhelmed with that
[1:40:11] kind of love in a situation like that
[1:40:12] are you still with me let me read on in
[1:40:15] another uh message here just a moment
[1:40:17] when Divine love is
[1:40:19] projected he said when those Hornets had
[1:40:22] covered I knew knew that I'd be stung to
[1:40:25] death in a few moments instead of
[1:40:28] running or being afraid you know that's
[1:40:30] the worst thing to do with
[1:40:32] Hornets because they chase they chase
[1:40:36] movement so he would have took off and
[1:40:39] guess what they'd have took off with him
[1:40:41] there was no Pond to jump into but I
[1:40:44] know someone who ran from a swarm of
[1:40:46] hornets and jumped in the pond and
[1:40:49] waited a while and when he thought they
[1:40:52] were gone he got out but they were
[1:40:55] waiting on
[1:40:56] him and he was severely
[1:41:00] stung he said I I'd be stung to death in
[1:41:03] a few moments instead of running or
[1:41:05] being afraid there's only two elements
[1:41:08] that you can be controlled by we ought
[1:41:10] to hear this that's either
[1:41:14] Faith or doubt you know we've got to
[1:41:18] believe that if someone came in here to
[1:41:20] do us
[1:41:22] harm
[1:41:24] we've got to believe that if we were at
[1:41:25] the mall and somebody came to do us harm
[1:41:29] we've got to believe that if we were in
[1:41:30] public somewhere and somebody came to do
[1:41:33] us harm we've got to believe that God's
[1:41:35] word
[1:41:36] works and we've got to believe that the
[1:41:38] that it expression of divine love would
[1:41:42] execute Sovereign Grace and that God
[1:41:45] would bring us through because you can't
[1:41:47] always get to a weapon it sounds to me
[1:41:50] like God's given us a built-in weapon if
[1:41:52] we're not afraid to use it he said doubt
[1:41:55] will accompany and fear will accompany
[1:41:57] doubt he said Jesus said fear not Don't
[1:42:00] Be Afraid God keeps his word no matter
[1:42:03] what condition you are tonight God keeps
[1:42:07] his word he goes on to tell in closing a
[1:42:10] few moments he said uh I loved those
[1:42:14] fellows that seems strange but I did and
[1:42:18] here's why I talk to them now I do not
[1:42:22] say that understood me but somebody
[1:42:26] understood me for I said little
[1:42:28] creatures of God I've interrupted you
[1:42:31] you were
[1:42:33] sleeping and I interrupted you he
[1:42:37] realized that he had disrupted
[1:42:39] them all right let's go on he said but
[1:42:43] I'm a servant of your Creator and his
[1:42:45] sick children are in my house to be
[1:42:48] prayed for and I was moving I'm sorry I
[1:42:51] Disturbed you
[1:42:54] you ought to hear this because they tell
[1:42:57] me we've got a real mosquito season
[1:42:59] ahead of
[1:43:01] us you might ought to try to practice
[1:43:03] some of this I know a mosquito is not a
[1:43:08] hornet but I don't really want to be
[1:43:10] visited by a bunch of mosquitoes either
[1:43:11] do you he said I was I I'm sorry I
[1:43:15] Disturbed you disturbed you little
[1:43:16] creatures of God in the name of Jesus
[1:43:18] Christ your creator my Lord hurry back
[1:43:22] into your house and I will not bother
[1:43:25] you no more and when I meet you at the
[1:43:29] Judgment he's talking to the people now
[1:43:30] not the Hornets those Hornets swarming
[1:43:34] over me had never touched me as yet they
[1:43:36] lined up in a single line and went right
[1:43:40] straight back into their nest love
[1:43:43] projected Sovereign Grace takes its
[1:43:48] place that's good now he goes into this
[1:43:52] story that I want to show share with you
[1:43:53] as well remind you of seven years I was
[1:43:56] game warden in Indiana one day while I
[1:43:58] was putting some fish in the water I
[1:44:00] don't know why I'm saying these things
[1:44:01] but crossing a field where a great bull
[1:44:04] had just killed a colored man and he
[1:44:06] belonged on the pasture of Mr gery up at
[1:44:10] Sellersburg Indiana so now you've got
[1:44:12] the details he said I forgot the bull
[1:44:15] was in there but there were signs all
[1:44:17] around do not enter but I had a little
[1:44:19] old gun that I was supposed to pack and
[1:44:22] I threw it in the car and I was going
[1:44:24] across the field over the hill to pray
[1:44:26] for a sick man that I knew and I was
[1:44:28] walking through that field not noticing
[1:44:31] and all of a sudden right down in a
[1:44:33] bunch of bushes up jumped this big
[1:44:36] killer and he looked at me he let out a
[1:44:39] roar he threw his head down and hooked
[1:44:41] his horns into the dirt and threw them
[1:44:44] back immediately I felt for my gun it
[1:44:47] was in the
[1:44:48] car there I stood
[1:44:51] alone the fence was about about 250
[1:44:54] yards the bull was about 30 yards no
[1:44:56] trees or nothing I said well here's the
[1:44:58] end I do not wish to die as a coward but
[1:45:02] I'll Stand and die as a Christian should
[1:45:04] die he's giving up and as I reckon
[1:45:07] myself and that big fella turned around
[1:45:10] I knew it must be death to be gored to
[1:45:13] death in a few moments oh he was more
[1:45:16] than a match for my strength are you
[1:45:18] getting the picture and I'm thankful I
[1:45:20] didn't have the gun for something
[1:45:22] happened oh EXC exuse my emotion but
[1:45:24] something happened love come
[1:45:31] down now this may seem strange but it's
[1:45:34] the truth I
[1:45:35] talked to that bull now don't let on and
[1:45:39] act like you've never talked to to a
[1:45:41] butterfly or a bird
[1:45:43] or don't act like you've never done such
[1:45:46] a
[1:45:47] thing anybody that's
[1:45:50] gardened has has had to talk to creature
[1:45:53] and you just go and leave us alone leave
[1:45:55] me alone he said I Disturbed you this is
[1:45:59] a killer bull recently killed a colored
[1:46:02] man he said but I'm the servant of your
[1:46:05] creator I'm on my road to pray for my
[1:46:07] sick brother I'm sorry I Disturbed you
[1:46:09] now you will not hurt me for I love
[1:46:12] you how can you hurt
[1:46:16] me when I love you oh I can just feel
[1:46:19] some folks this is so crazy so forign to
[1:46:24] some folks but it ought not to be
[1:46:26] foreign to us we've seen what the
[1:46:29] supernatural can do he said and here he
[1:46:32] come I was I was no more afraid of that
[1:46:34] animal than I am of a Brethren sitting
[1:46:36] here he come and I just stood there and
[1:46:38] I said I love you because God created
[1:46:41] you I Disturbed you and I'm sorry and as
[1:46:45] he come close to me I Stood Still and he
[1:46:48] got within about 10t that's pretty close
[1:46:51] he threw out his feet and stopped and he
[1:46:53] looked so depleted he looked this way
[1:46:55] and that way and I said in the name of
[1:46:57] the Lord Jesus you creature of God's
[1:47:00] creation go over and lay back
[1:47:02] down and God being my witness the bull
[1:47:05] turned around and laid down and I walked
[1:47:07] in five feet of him anybody believe that
[1:47:11] I do what was it death was at hand love
[1:47:15] was
[1:47:16] projected and Sovereign Grace stopped
[1:47:20] the bull if sovereign grace through love
[1:47:24] projected can stop the bull what can it
[1:47:26] do in an
[1:47:28] argument what can it do in a house
[1:47:30] that's been turned upside down by
[1:47:32] yelling and screaming and hateful words
[1:47:35] and
[1:47:36] bitterness what can it do when a husband
[1:47:39] has gone off on his wife or a wife gone
[1:47:41] off on her husband or children have gone
[1:47:44] off in disrespect toward their parents
[1:47:47] what can happen when somebody recognizes
[1:47:50] in the chaos and in the turmoil that
[1:47:53] this is not the answer we're never going
[1:47:56] to find a solution by yelling we're
[1:47:58] never going to find a solution in anger
[1:48:01] but if somebody could remember that love
[1:48:04] is the
[1:48:05] key that love overrides the
[1:48:10] anger it overrides the rebellious nature
[1:48:14] of this situation it overrides every
[1:48:19] detail the prophet is telling us these
[1:48:22] little sto stories so that we understand
[1:48:25] that even in our
[1:48:27] situations here come a man we told this
[1:48:29] Tuesday night here come a man ready to
[1:48:32] to take him out right on the platform
[1:48:35] and ended up just falling right down at
[1:48:38] his
[1:48:39] feet maybe you've been in a situation
[1:48:41] where you're being raged at and and and
[1:48:45] and you you respond in anger and what
[1:48:49] happens then it just gets bigger and
[1:48:52] bigger it becomes like a snowball
[1:48:54] rolling down the hill it accelerates
[1:48:56] anger accelerates anger hatred
[1:48:59] accelerates hatred remember he said
[1:49:01] hatred gives birth to hatred the same
[1:49:05] way love gives birth to love love
[1:49:07] reproduces itself in love if we could
[1:49:10] remember that in those kinds of
[1:49:13] situations I've told you before there's
[1:49:16] been a few times in our house when when
[1:49:18] we would just really be all all arguing
[1:49:22] at one time time everybody just arguing
[1:49:24] at one time now nobody's punching
[1:49:27] anybody you don't have to punch somebody
[1:49:30] to be violent hello everybody is just
[1:49:33] mad at everybody and all it
[1:49:38] took all it took was for
[1:49:42] Joshua he's the one that God always used
[1:49:45] in that situation usually to say wait a
[1:49:49] minute this is not right now who wants
[1:49:53] to fight keep on fighting then this is
[1:49:56] not
[1:49:58] God this is not
[1:50:00] love this is not how we ought to be
[1:50:03] acting now let me ask you a question who
[1:50:05] wants to fight
[1:50:08] then a few minutes later everybody was
[1:50:10] saying but I'm right and you're
[1:50:14] wrong but when somebody calls you out
[1:50:16] like that and you realize that's not
[1:50:19] love operating here we're not acting
[1:50:21] like children of God God we're not
[1:50:23] behaving like Believers we're certainly
[1:50:26] not behaving like we love one another
[1:50:28] all you got to do is be called out a
[1:50:29] little bit and it just it's it's
[1:50:31] literally like deflating a a a a a
[1:50:34] basketball or something you
[1:50:36] know it's like all the air is sucked out
[1:50:39] of the situation out of the room and all
[1:50:41] of a sudden you just say huh what are we
[1:50:44] doing I'm so sorry I'm so sorry no I'm
[1:50:48] so sorry I was wrong no I was wrong no I
[1:50:50] was wrong anybody ever been in a
[1:50:52] situation like that that's what love can
[1:50:56] accomplish it's not easy to remember
[1:50:58] that in the moment you got to have a
[1:51:00] Joshua you got to have somebody you've
[1:51:02] got to be the Joshua in your house
[1:51:05] you've got to be the Joshua in your
[1:51:07] situation you've got to be somebody that
[1:51:10] says wait a minute we are not
[1:51:12] accomplishing anything ugly is about to
[1:51:16] get uglier we need to remember who we
[1:51:18] are we need to remember who we belong to
[1:51:21] we need to remember what God has done
[1:51:23] for us and we need to act on that are
[1:51:26] you with me now somebody said I can't
[1:51:29] relate to Bulls well you could if you
[1:51:30] was in a in a field with one I can't
[1:51:33] really relate to Hornets well you could
[1:51:35] if you'd ever experien but you can
[1:51:37] certainly relate to a family situation
[1:51:41] getting out of hand I know you'd like
[1:51:45] some of you'd like for us to
[1:51:47] think I can tell by the way you cocked
[1:51:49] your head when I said that a while ago
[1:51:51] some of you is doing like this you would
[1:51:53] like for us to think it's never happened
[1:51:55] in your
[1:51:57] place but it does and all it takes is
[1:52:01] for somebody to recognize what's going
[1:52:03] on a husband and a wife to recognize
[1:52:07] this is this is the
[1:52:09] enemy he doesn't want us to love one
[1:52:11] another he wants us to hate one another
[1:52:14] come on he wants us to hurt one another
[1:52:17] you know it works with
[1:52:19] in-laws yes did you know it works with
[1:52:22] in-laws too did you know it works with
[1:52:27] Outlaws did you know love works with
[1:52:29] in-laws and outlaws do you know love
[1:52:32] works in every situation God told us it
[1:52:36] would sometimes we've got to put it to
[1:52:38] the test he goes on we didn't quite
[1:52:41] finish that or did we we did uh flash up
[1:52:45] the last little part of it again then
[1:52:47] God being my
[1:52:49] witness God being my witness the bull
[1:52:52] turned around and laid down and I walked
[1:52:53] in 5T of him what was it death was at
[1:52:57] hand love was projected and Sovereign
[1:53:00] Grace stopped the bull Sovereign Grace
[1:53:04] stopped the
[1:53:07] argument Sovereign Grace let me keep my
[1:53:12] job Sovereign Grace let me leave the gun
[1:53:16] under the
[1:53:17] seat when I could have acted the
[1:53:21] fool Sovereign Grace kept a a road rage
[1:53:25] incident from happening in me being
[1:53:26] right in the middle of it brother I saw
[1:53:28] your hand I'm not going to go into it
[1:53:31] it's your testimony TOA but I know I
[1:53:34] know he
[1:53:36] knows I know he knows that God can come
[1:53:39] down in a moment and spare your life and
[1:53:43] somebody else's life because you're
[1:53:45] angry why would God do that for somebody
[1:53:48] that may not even be serving him the way
[1:53:50] they should because remember God knew us
[1:53:52] before for the foundation of the world
[1:53:54] you let Brother David tell you his
[1:53:56] testimony it it'll shock you cuz you
[1:53:58] don't know that
[1:54:00] David the David that he was then is not
[1:54:03] the one that he is now because that's
[1:54:05] what oh Hallelujah I'm about to get
[1:54:07] motional here because that's what
[1:54:09] Sovereign Grace does yes now okay you
[1:54:13] you know you you've heard these stories
[1:54:14] in brother brandom and and some of you
[1:54:17] have a problem with that anyway and so
[1:54:19] let me tell you he's not the only one he
[1:54:22] he's not the only one uh in in
[1:54:26] 1904 there was a a he's referred to as a
[1:54:30] Christian
[1:54:31] Mystic remember that these men didn't
[1:54:34] know what we know didn't mean they
[1:54:37] didn't know God it means that many of
[1:54:40] them didn't know what we know some of
[1:54:42] them didn't have the right
[1:54:44] baptism they didn't know what we know
[1:54:46] Martin Luther didn't have the right
[1:54:48] baptism he didn't know what we know so
[1:54:51] if you're one of those who comes to the
[1:54:54] message and and believes that that we're
[1:54:56] the only
[1:54:57] Christians then you're a
[1:55:01] cult that's not what we teach in this
[1:55:04] church we believe what the Bible said
[1:55:07] whosoever calleth upon the name of the
[1:55:10] Lord shall be saved we do believe
[1:55:13] there's a message that's been sent for
[1:55:16] the Bride of Jesus Christ but we believe
[1:55:18] there's those who are not predestinated
[1:55:20] to be bride that are saved so we don't
[1:55:24] throw Martin Luther out because he
[1:55:25] didn't get it all right we don't throw
[1:55:28] the Pentecostals out or the charismatics
[1:55:30] out because they don't always get it
[1:55:32] right so here was a man by the name of
[1:55:35] sadu Sundar
[1:55:37] sing he was 15 years old when he was
[1:55:40] converted to Christianity through a
[1:55:42] supernatural Vision that God gave him he
[1:55:45] was baptized into the church of England
[1:55:48] in
[1:55:49] 1905 sing afterward Dawn the robe of a
[1:55:52] sadu which is a holy man in Hinduism he
[1:55:55] believed that God had called him to take
[1:55:58] the message of Christ to the
[1:56:01] Hindus he believed that he would be more
[1:56:04] effective in a robe that they
[1:56:08] respected than in the cloth of the
[1:56:11] Church of England now you may think
[1:56:13] that's the craziest thing you've ever
[1:56:15] heard but remember that I have a a
[1:56:18] friend who has who believes that he has
[1:56:21] the same calling and when he came here
[1:56:23] to minister he wore the saffron
[1:56:26] robe of a sadu and people have lots to
[1:56:30] say about it because what people don't
[1:56:32] understand they often criticize but I've
[1:56:35] traveled in the nations with him and I
[1:56:37] know the opportunity that God gave him
[1:56:40] wearing that robe that God didn't give
[1:56:42] me dressed the way I was dressed and
[1:56:45] finally I told him I'm going to have to
[1:56:47] buy you an Overcoat brother saidu
[1:56:49] because there are times we have to get
[1:56:50] through the airport and we don't always
[1:56:53] have time for you to pray for every
[1:56:55] person in the airport sometime we have a
[1:56:57] flight to catch and and he said it's my
[1:57:03] robe you might you might not understand
[1:57:05] why the former Amish and uh uh still
[1:57:08] dress in a plain
[1:57:10] way instead of like a you know like like
[1:57:13] you let's just say it like that like you
[1:57:15] or like me they do it because they
[1:57:17] believe that God has called them to have
[1:57:19] a Ministry to the people that he
[1:57:21] separated them from and that's what made
[1:57:24] the concrete lady wonder if we were all
[1:57:27] Amish but we're not but we love our
[1:57:30] brothers and sisters and they're just
[1:57:31] like us and they may choose I mean they
[1:57:34] may choose a bit of a strange
[1:57:38] haircut but they understand that by
[1:57:40] doing that they have a lot more likely
[1:57:44] of an opportunity to witness to somebody
[1:57:47] in that
[1:57:48] community so I I caught just a little
[1:57:50] glimpse of the church dedication in Ohio
[1:57:53] uh last night and a little bit this
[1:57:55] morning and there are menites there who
[1:57:58] who are still wearing head covering and
[1:58:00] still still dressed like men and I who
[1:58:03] are hearing some things perhaps they've
[1:58:05] never heard before and they might not
[1:58:07] even go down to the local Baptist Church
[1:58:09] or the local Assembly of God Church or
[1:58:12] the local message church but they were
[1:58:14] willing to go there because they knew
[1:58:16] that the people were plain in their
[1:58:18] dress and in their nature do you get it
[1:58:21] so sad Su Dar Singh believed that he
[1:58:24] would was called to win uh Hindus to the
[1:58:29] message of Christ but instead of wearing
[1:58:31] a three-piece suit like the Church of
[1:58:33] England he continued to wear a saffron
[1:58:36] robe whether you like it or not that's
[1:58:38] the way it happened and I'm not here to
[1:58:40] defend him or to criticize him but you
[1:58:43] know his his uh his testimony stands for
[1:58:46] itself are you with me and he
[1:58:49] disappeared nobody knows what happened
[1:58:52] to him in April of 1929 he was on a
[1:58:55] particular mission to
[1:58:57] Tibet because that in Tibet is where
[1:59:00] many of the highest orders of the Hindu
[1:59:02] priests lived and and uh in in in uh
[1:59:07] community and uh it was treacherous
[1:59:10] territory treacherous mountains and uh
[1:59:13] hostile environment and nobody has
[1:59:16] really ever been able to tell us what
[1:59:18] happened to him but I want to share with
[1:59:21] you just a piece of testimony that was
[1:59:23] written by by a person who knew him very
[1:59:27] well he said those who red or lived with
[1:59:31] him not only saw but recorded some of
[1:59:35] the marvelous events which seemed to
[1:59:38] constantly take place around him thus a
[1:59:41] gentleman who later became a YMCA
[1:59:44] secretary in England wrote of that night
[1:59:47] which had left him stunned and
[1:59:50] speechless he said long long after
[1:59:52] midnight I was roused by a movement in
[1:59:55] the room the sadu had risen from his bed
[1:59:58] and was moving toward the door which
[2:00:01] opened on the wooden stairs outside the
[2:00:03] little house where they were
[2:00:05] staying the creaking of the wood made it
[2:00:09] clear that he was going down the steps
[2:00:11] and knowing that the sadu spent hours of
[2:00:14] the night in prayer I was not surprised
[2:00:16] by his behavior but when half an hour
[2:00:19] had passed and he had not returned I
[2:00:22] became uneasy the thought of the leopard
[2:00:26] that lived in the valley that we had
[2:00:29] been amply warned about made me feel
[2:00:32] anxious and so I got out of bed and I
[2:00:35] looked out of the window toward the
[2:00:37] forest a few yards from the house I saw
[2:00:41] sadu sitting looking down into the deep
[2:00:43] valley it was a beautiful night the
[2:00:46] stars were shining brightly for a few
[2:00:49] moments I watched the silent figure of
[2:00:52] sadu in prayer then my eyes were
[2:00:55] attracted by something moving on his
[2:00:57] right an animal was approaching him
[2:01:03] carefully as it got nearer I recognized
[2:01:06] it to be a
[2:01:08] leopard choked with fear now you'd have
[2:01:11] to read a little bit before this in the
[2:01:13] story to know that the whole Community
[2:01:15] had been stirred because a leopard had
[2:01:17] been coming and taking people out of
[2:01:19] their
[2:01:20] beds and consuming them so this was this
[2:01:23] was a well-known leopard that had the
[2:01:26] taste of human
[2:01:27] blood and so he said uh as as it got
[2:01:31] nearer I saw that it was a leopard
[2:01:33] choked with fear I stood motionless near
[2:01:35] the windows unable even to call just
[2:01:38] then sadu turned his face toward the
[2:01:40] animal and held out his
[2:01:43] hand as though it had been a dog the
[2:01:47] leopard came laid down and stretched out
[2:01:51] beside the
[2:01:53] sadu offering his head to be stroked
[2:01:57] like a common house cat well known in
[2:02:01] England it was a strange unbelievable
[2:02:03] scene I can never forget it a short time
[2:02:07] after that sadu returned and was soon
[2:02:09] asleep but I lay awake
[2:02:13] wondering I lay awake
[2:02:15] pondering what was it what was it that
[2:02:19] made this man of prayer be able to name
[2:02:22] the leopard the killer
[2:02:25] leopard I recognized it was divine
[2:02:31] love the leopard didn't feel
[2:02:34] threatened he felt love now I'm not a
[2:02:38] Catholic but I'm not someone who
[2:02:41] believes that every person who came to
[2:02:43] Faith through through the teachings of
[2:02:46] of Catholicism has gone to hell I
[2:02:49] believe uh a as as we understand by the
[2:02:53] message that there are those who come to
[2:02:56] a certain level of revelation and they
[2:02:59] they can't get anywhere else you
[2:03:01] understand it wasn't for them to
[2:03:04] understand different things so please
[2:03:06] don't be offended when I mention One
[2:03:08] More Story like this this happened to be
[2:03:10] St Francis and when you hear someone say
[2:03:13] St Francis you immediately think you
[2:03:15] know well I I just don't even want to
[2:03:17] hear a story like that you need to
[2:03:19] remember that when the church ages are
[2:03:21] being being taught to us the messenger
[2:03:24] to those early church
[2:03:28] ages they were products of the Catholic
[2:03:31] Church they had enough of God in them
[2:03:35] and God had enough confidence in them
[2:03:38] that he used them as Messengers to the
[2:03:40] church age now I don't know that you can
[2:03:43] get by in this hour with the things that
[2:03:45] these folk got by with in their day I'm
[2:03:48] not here to say yay or nay but I want to
[2:03:51] share Theory story with you
[2:03:52] again perhaps the most famous story of
[2:03:55] St Francis is when he tamed a
[2:03:58] wolf that was terrorizing the people of
[2:04:00] the city of
[2:04:02] gobel while Francis was staying in that
[2:04:05] town he learned that there was a wolf so
[2:04:07] ravenous that it was not only killing
[2:04:09] and eating animals but had started now
[2:04:12] eating people too the people took up
[2:04:15] arms and went after it but those who
[2:04:17] encountered the wolf perished at its
[2:04:20] sharp teeth villagers became afraid to
[2:04:23] leave the walls of the city Francis had
[2:04:26] pity on the people and decided to go out
[2:04:29] and meet the wolf he was desperately
[2:04:31] warned by the people but he insisted
[2:04:33] that God would take care of
[2:04:36] him the bray frier and several peasants
[2:04:39] accompanied Francis Outside The City
[2:04:41] Gate but soon The Peasants lost heart
[2:04:44] and they said they would go no further
[2:04:46] Francis and His companion began to walk
[2:04:49] on suddenly the W the wolf appeared
[2:04:52] Jaws open he charged out of the woods
[2:04:56] toward the two men Francis the power of
[2:05:00] God in Francis caused the wolf to slow
[2:05:03] down and C close its mouth Francis
[2:05:08] called out to the creature Come to Me
[2:05:10] Brother
[2:05:12] Wolf hello you're supposed to smile you
[2:05:16] didn't it's okay come to me Brother Wolf
[2:05:20] in the name of Christ I order you to
[2:05:23] hurt no one and at that moment the wolf
[2:05:27] lowered its head and lay down at the
[2:05:29] feet of Francis Meek as a lamb Francis
[2:05:34] explained to the
[2:05:38] wolf that he had been terrorizing the
[2:05:40] people killing not only animals but now
[2:05:43] humans that were made in the image of
[2:05:45] God Brother Wolf said Francis I want to
[2:05:48] make peace between you and the people of
[2:05:50] this town they will harm you no more and
[2:05:54] you must no longer harm them all past
[2:05:59] crimes are to be
[2:06:02] forgiven the wolf showed its Ascent by
[2:06:05] moving its body and nodding its head as
[2:06:08] though it understood the Covenant that
[2:06:10] Francis was making with him then to the
[2:06:13] absolute surprise of the Gathering crowd
[2:06:16] Francis asked the wolf to make a
[2:06:18] pledge as St Francis extended his hand
[2:06:21] to receive the pledge the wolf extended
[2:06:24] its front paw and placed it into his
[2:06:26] hand then Francis commanded the wolf to
[2:06:29] follow him into the town and make peace
[2:06:33] with the town's people the wolf the
[2:06:36] killer wolf the wolf that had once
[2:06:39] terrorized The Village followed St
[2:06:42] Francis humbly quietly into the town by
[2:06:46] the time they got to the Town Square
[2:06:48] everyone was there to witness the
[2:06:50] miracle now these are the ones that had
[2:06:52] run from him who had been fearful of his
[2:06:56] destruction Francis gave the town a
[2:06:58] sermon on the wonderful and fearful love
[2:07:03] of God calling them to repent from all
[2:07:07] their sins and then he offered the
[2:07:09] town's people peace on behalf of the
[2:07:10] wolf the town's people promised in a
[2:07:13] loud voice to feed the wolf to take care
[2:07:15] of the wolf so it never would have to
[2:07:18] terrorize the town again Francis asked
[2:07:20] the wolf if he would live in peace under
[2:07:22] those terms he bowed his head oh this is
[2:07:25] getting strange for some of you I can
[2:07:27] see you I see you you know a
[2:07:30] supernatural
[2:07:31] people isn't that what we were called to
[2:07:34] be a supernatural people
[2:07:37] yeah from that day on the people uh the
[2:07:41] wolf again placed his paw in Francis
[2:07:43] hand as a sign of the Covenant as a sign
[2:07:46] of the pack and from that day on the
[2:07:48] people kept the pack that they made the
[2:07:49] wolf lived for two years among the
[2:07:51] town's people going from door to door
[2:07:53] for food it hurt no one and no one hurt
[2:07:56] it even the dogs refused to bark at the
[2:07:58] wolf when the wolf finally died of old
[2:08:01] age the people of the village
[2:08:04] wept the wolf's peaceful ways had been a
[2:08:07] living reminder to them of the Wonders
[2:08:10] and the patience and the virtues and the
[2:08:12] Holiness of God and his servants it had
[2:08:15] been a living symbol of the power and
[2:08:17] Providence of the Living God I could go
[2:08:19] on there are multiple stories in history
[2:08:24] that that demonstrate to us that when
[2:08:27] love is
[2:08:29] projected not fileo love agapo love
[2:08:34] God's Divine love that's been placed in
[2:08:37] us when when it has been projected
[2:08:39] Sovereign Grace has moved in to take
[2:08:42] over and a whole village was one to
[2:08:45] Christ a whole village hear this Souls
[2:08:48] were saved lives were changed because
[2:08:52] love was projected and and a a wild wolf
[2:08:55] became a tamed wolf before I lose all of
[2:08:58] your attention let's go to First Peter
[2:09:00] for just a moment and we'll close before
[2:09:02] too
[2:09:03] long I was told that five pages was all
[2:09:07] that I needed to bring this
[2:09:13] morning
[2:09:17] Benjamin I'm so thankful that I listen
[2:09:19] to the Holy Spirit
[2:09:22] first but he's not Benjamin's not always
[2:09:25] wrong 1 Peter chap

[2:09:44] grudging as every man hath received the
[2:09:47] gift even so Minister the same one to
[2:09:50] another as good stewards of the manifold
[2:09:53] grace of God if any man speak let him
[2:09:56] speak as the Oracles of God if any man
[2:09:59] Minister let him do it as of the ability
[2:10:01] which God giveth that God in all things

[2:10:06] to whom be praise and Dominion forever
[2:10:09] and ever do you see how important love
[2:10:11] is in Ministry second Peter chapter 1 in
[2:10:16] verse one read Simon Peter a servant and
[2:10:20] an apostle of Jesus Jesus Christ to them
[2:10:22] that have obtained like Precious Faith
[2:10:24] with us through the righteousness of God
[2:10:26] and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and
[2:10:30] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[2:10:32] knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord
[2:10:35] all of this salutation and then all of a
[2:10:38] sudden he gets to the meat according as
[2:10:41] his divine power hath given unto us all
[2:10:45] things the divine power of God hath
[2:10:48] given unto us all things that attain
[2:10:51] unto life and godliness did you hear
[2:10:53] brother gy saying that earlier my home
[2:10:56] my money anything that that I have I
[2:11:00] remember I remember my grandfather
[2:11:02] struggle that was one of the issues that
[2:11:03] he struggled with he couldn't understand
[2:11:06] how if he had to go and work for it it
[2:11:08] was God Who provided it and one day he
[2:11:11] lost his
[2:11:13] health and he realized he no longer had
[2:11:15] the strength to go and work for it he
[2:11:17] realized it had been God taking care of
[2:11:19] him so all things that pertain unto life
[2:11:22] and godliness are given to us by the
[2:11:25] divine power of God through the
[2:11:27] knowledge of him that have called us to
[2:11:29] what strife and
[2:11:32] contention no argument and fussing no
[2:11:37] glory and virtue let me hear the Saints
[2:11:40] amen am whereby are given unto us
[2:11:44] exceeding great and precious promises
[2:11:46] that by these you might be partakers of
[2:11:50] what
[2:11:52] can you imagine that God is calling a
[2:11:54] people together in the spirit that he
[2:11:57] wants to share his divine nature with
[2:12:01] having escaped the corruption that is in
[2:12:03] the world through lust where and he goes
[2:12:07] on and beside this giving all
[2:12:11] diligence add to your faith
[2:12:15] virtue it's not faith and
[2:12:18] virtue it's faith and virtue and to
[2:12:23] Virtue knowledge help
[2:12:26] me and beside this let's go on and to
[2:12:30] knowledge
[2:12:32] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[2:12:36] and to patience
[2:12:38] godliness let's go on and to
[2:12:42] Godliness brother to kindness and a
[2:12:45] brotherly kindness charity agapo love
[2:12:49] for if these things be in you in you and
[2:12:55] abound if they are multiplying in you if
[2:12:59] they are abounding in manifestation in
[2:13:01] you they make you these virtues make you
[2:13:06] that you shall neither be Barren let's
[2:13:08] claim that nor unfruitful in the
[2:13:11] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:13:14] praise God but he that lackthe things is
[2:13:19] blind and cannot see a far off and hath
[2:13:22] forgotten that he was purged from his
[2:13:25] old sins brother vom Drew this out for
[2:13:28] us uh uh many many years ago can you
[2:13:31] show us that picture and just refresh
[2:13:34] our mind can everybody get a hold of
[2:13:36] that it it's the stature of a perfect
[2:13:40] man I like to say the perfect
[2:13:43] man because the perfect man is the Lord
[2:13:46] Jesus Christ and it is to his stature
[2:13:49] that we reach it's it's our desire to to
[2:13:53] find ourselves in in his stature and
[2:13:57] when God showed it to him he showed it
[2:14:00] to him like a pyramid add to your faith
[2:14:03] virtue to your virtue knowledge
[2:14:06] knowledge Temperance Temperance patience
[2:14:10] to patience add godliness and then
[2:14:12] brotherly kindness then he talks about
[2:14:15] the coming of the Holy
[2:14:17] Spirit the sealing of the holy spirit
[2:14:20] that will only come when all of these
[2:14:23] other elements or all of these other
[2:14:27] virtues are operating in the life of the
[2:14:30] believer then that final ceiling not the
[2:14:33] earnest of the holy spirit that we
[2:14:35] receive in the baptism but the final
[2:14:38] ceiling of the holy spirit will come and
[2:14:40] and so he writes it in the top there and
[2:14:43] the
[2:14:45] Capstone the Capstone that comes to to
[2:14:48] to top off the statue of a perfect man
[2:14:53] after the birthing of the cealing of the
[2:14:55] holy spirit it's love it's not human
[2:14:58] love it's divine love it's perfect love
[2:15:03] it's mature love does that help anybody
[2:15:06] to see it kind of drawn out like that
[2:15:08] and we don't have time but he took it
[2:15:11] through the church ages Ephesus Smyrna
[2:15:13] pergamus thyra Sardis Philadelphia and
[2:15:16] leoda and he also took it through the
[2:15:18] Stars to the seven churches the
[2:15:21] Messengers Paul arenus Martin Columba
[2:15:23] Luther Wesley and then the promised
[2:15:26] Return of the spirit of Elijah in the
[2:15:28] last days who would be the seventh
[2:15:30] Church age messenger the spokesman for
[2:15:33] the seventh angel of the Book of
[2:15:35] Revelation so we've got the church ages
[2:15:37] and we've got the we have the uh also
[2:15:40] the The Messengers of the church ages
[2:15:43] notice at the top of the pyramid he the
[2:15:46] word Jesus was written because he said
[2:15:49] that is divine love he he is divine love
[2:15:53] do do I have just a few more minutes
[2:15:55] thank you in in the message a
[2:15:57] Blasphemous
[2:15:59] names this was preached just after the
[2:16:02] stature of a perfect man he said first
[2:16:04] foundationally is Faith second add to
[2:16:06] your faith virtue to your virtue
[2:16:08] Knowledge from knowledge Temperance from
[2:16:09] Temperance patience to patience
[2:16:11] godliness and from godliness or two
[2:16:15] godliness we add Brotherly Love or
[2:16:18] brotherly kindness and then love of
[2:16:21] being the Capstone which we just went
[2:16:24] through when he is teaching on godliness
[2:16:28] he said godliness is to be just like God
[2:16:31] it's to be changed into the image and to
[2:16:35] the reflection of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:16:38] and it's only when a Believer has
[2:16:40] reached that place that all of those
[2:16:42] virtues are in him and abounding that he
[2:16:45] can receive that final Capstone which is
[2:16:48] divine love he told us without that
[2:16:50] Divine love manifested in our lives we
[2:16:53] would not make the
[2:16:55] Rapture so for you and I to sit and say
[2:16:58] I'm not interested and all that that
[2:16:59] doesn't appeal to me it doesn't matter
[2:17:01] whether it appeals to you or not we must
[2:17:03] have those things operating in our life
[2:17:06] to make the body change now who's on
[2:17:09] board if you knew that it took Divine
[2:17:11] love if you knew that it took breaking
[2:17:14] through all of the barriers of humanity
[2:17:17] to love like Christ loved to love
[2:17:21] without
[2:17:22] prejudice to love without respect of
[2:17:25] color or Creed or Dogma or or background
[2:17:30] Come On To Love regardless of
[2:17:33] nationality or social status or economic
[2:17:37] ability to love like Christ loved if you
[2:17:40] knew that it was going to take that to
[2:17:42] make the Rapture how many of you would
[2:17:44] pursue that kind of
[2:17:46] love five of
[2:17:49] us
[2:17:52] it's much more than the raising of a
[2:17:54] hand it's a
[2:17:56] lifestyle and it's active somebody said
[2:17:59] I could never get to that place not on
[2:18:01] your own but let me tell you where
[2:18:03] changes like that take place in the
[2:18:06] presence of the
[2:18:09] Lord so when worship is going on and you
[2:18:13] stand like a cactus in the
[2:18:17] desert some great
[2:18:19] Saro when when worship is going on and
[2:18:22] the presence of the Lord is moving
[2:18:25] through the
[2:18:26] place and you remember your dignity more
[2:18:29] than you do your desire to worship God
[2:18:32] and you can't even lift up your hand and
[2:18:34] give God honor which the scripture
[2:18:36] doesn't suggest it
[2:18:39] demands you see there's a lot of people
[2:18:41] that think they can worship according to
[2:18:43] their
[2:18:44] personality but the Bible said we
[2:18:46] worship according to what the Bible says
[2:18:49] oh I would that men
[2:18:53] everywhere well I just don't like going
[2:18:55] over there cuz they clap after the
[2:18:57] prayer and they clap during the singing
[2:18:59] and they clap after the sing clap your
[2:19:01] hands oh ye people shout unto God come
[2:19:04] on I I just don't like the way they jump
[2:19:07] around leap for Joy that's what the word
[2:19:10] said I saw some granny up there dancing
[2:19:13] praise ye the Lord in the dance that's
[2:19:18] not some Pentecostal Creed that's not
[2:19:21] some denominational requirement that's
[2:19:24] what the word said so if we desire to
[2:19:28] have all of these things operating in
[2:19:30] our life Faith virtue knowledge
[2:19:33] Temperance patience godliness and then
[2:19:36] Brotherly Love brotherly kindness which
[2:19:39] is fraternal affection it's a
[2:19:42] Brotherhood the church is not to be a
[2:19:44] business it's not a corporation the
[2:19:47] church is to be a living organism it's
[2:19:50] to be a family of Believers that come
[2:19:54] together and they may not like each
[2:19:56] other initially but they learn to
[2:20:00] because love covers a multitude of sins
[2:20:04] love covers the weirdness of someone's
[2:20:08] personality love covers the parts of
[2:20:11] somebody that you don't like love will
[2:20:15] make you care for your crazy
[2:20:19] uncle God
[2:20:22] yes I don't get much response when I
[2:20:24] talk about crazy maybe it's a crazy
[2:20:29] ant maybe it's a real weird cousin or
[2:20:32] something I don't know but I know you've
[2:20:34] got
[2:20:36] them not in my
[2:20:40] family everybody and you know God put
[2:20:42] them there that's what you need to know
[2:20:44] you've been trying to put them out and
[2:20:47] God's been trying to put them in because
[2:20:50] we need them
[2:20:52] it's by these things that we bump into
[2:20:54] one another how many of you have ever
[2:20:56] bumped into anybody you bump in and you
[2:20:59] and the rough edges get knocked off and
[2:21:02] where these things take place is not at
[2:21:05] the bonfire and most of all it's not on
[2:21:08] the volleyball
[2:21:11] court it's in the presence of the
[2:21:17] Lord like
[2:21:19] oil upon his
[2:21:22] feet like wine for you to
[2:21:25] drink like water from my heart I pour my
[2:21:29] love on you if praise is like
[2:21:35] Spiker if praise is like perfume if it's
[2:21:38] like rose
[2:21:42] oil the most expensive
[2:21:46] oil that I use is what honey uh lemon
[2:21:50] bomb but what's it called
[2:21:54] Melissa I've only ever had two bottles
[2:21:56] of it one I bought and one was given to
[2:21:59] me and I use it sparingly because it's
[2:22:03] so expensive but it does so many things
[2:22:06] for me so I have to find a way to relate
[2:22:10] to it you know I can't really relate to
[2:22:12] Mary I I I I haven't live the life that
[2:22:15] Mary lived so I have to really get into
[2:22:17] it to kind of try to understand so when
[2:22:19] I'm looking at this scripture I try to
[2:22:21] kind of remember my my Melissa
[2:22:24] oil and and and how I feel when somebody
[2:22:28] wants to borrow
[2:22:34] it my wife has asked me on occasion is
[2:22:37] your Melissa all handy
[2:22:39] mm it's not handy as in the other room
[2:22:43] see because it's valuable to me it's not
[2:22:47] that I can't pull my pennies together
[2:22:49] and order another bottle but the one
[2:22:50] I've got is precious to me because it
[2:22:52] does something for me it helps me so
[2:22:55] when you're
[2:22:57] praising you've got to look at your
[2:22:59] praise like that it's got to be a little
[2:23:00] bit costly to you if it's comfortable to
[2:23:04] you it's probably not
[2:23:07] costly it's when we're able to move out
[2:23:10] of our comfort
[2:23:11] zone and begin to pour our love on him
[2:23:14] my
[2:23:16] God I want to raise
[2:23:19] worshippers yes I I do I want to raise
[2:23:22] worshippers for him if I could be my
[2:23:25] Ministry I tell you it's really all I I
[2:23:27] need if I could just raise up some
[2:23:30] worshippers who will worship Him in
[2:23:32] spirit and in truth because I know I got
[2:23:35] to I got to CM myself here I know that
[2:23:38] it's in the presence of the Lord that
[2:23:40] all the other stuff melts
[2:23:43] off it's not how many documentaries we
[2:23:45] watch it's not how smart we
[2:23:48] get it's how much time we've
[2:23:58] it's how much time we're willing to
[2:24:01] spend in the presence of the
[2:24:04] Lord it's in that
[2:24:07] presence that virtue is added to our
[2:24:11] faith it's in that presence of the
[2:24:16] Lord he says in paragraph 65 and then
[2:24:20] love being the calf
[2:24:21] Stone seven of those things seven Church
[2:24:25] ages and all of it tempered together oh
[2:24:30] God we need
[2:24:32] you I'm sorry I'm I'm feeling a little
[2:24:35] intercession now in my spirit
[2:24:42] hallelujah it's
[2:24:44] all all of it tempered together melted
[2:24:48] together by the the Holy
[2:24:51] Spirit we need him he not an it he's not
[2:24:56] an
[2:24:57] it now that's what it takes to become a
[2:25:00] servant of
[2:25:01] Christ Christ builds his church in the
[2:25:04] seven Church ages I believe that his
[2:25:07] bride a person woman Church seven Church
[2:25:10] ages constitute and make the bride some
[2:25:14] out of this age and some out of that age
[2:25:16] and some out of that age and all
[2:25:18] together shaping
[2:25:21] like a
[2:25:23] pyramid meaning
[2:25:26] steps getting higher and higher and
[2:25:30] higher as we just showed in the
[2:25:32] diagram in the message the stature of a
[2:25:35] perfect man just before the one we just
[2:25:37] read paragraph 307 he said perfect takes
[2:25:42] godliness you have to at you you have to
[2:25:46] add to your
[2:25:48] faith and remember I explained to you
[2:25:50] that it comes by a birth it doesn't come
[2:25:53] by an
[2:25:54] impartation it comes everything we get
[2:25:56] in Christ in this last day comes through
[2:25:59] a birthing process because you've got to
[2:26:02] have your own personal relationship with
[2:26:04] Jesus Christ he has no
[2:26:07] grandchildren have you been born again
[2:26:11] have you been born again of the spirit
[2:26:13] of God it's such a question how do I
[2:26:16] enter into my mother's womb a second
[2:26:18] time and be born it's not by the natur
[2:26:20] natural it's by the spiritual that we
[2:26:23] have this experience do you know what
[2:26:25] would you answer if someone were to look
[2:26:27] at you today and say do you know that
[2:26:29] you're born
[2:26:31] again there there are those around this
[2:26:33] message who believe they're saved
[2:26:35] because of what they believe the Bible
[2:26:37] tells us that's
[2:26:38] incorrect you can't say because I
[2:26:41] believe brother brandom is a prophet I'm
[2:26:42] born again you can't say because I
[2:26:45] believe my pastor is a godly man I'm
[2:26:47] born again you've got to encounter God
[2:26:51] for
[2:26:54] yourself you've got to know him in the
[2:26:57] power of his resurrection and he stands
[2:27:01] ready if it were what we
[2:27:04] believed that saved us then the devil is
[2:27:08] saved because the Bible said that demons
[2:27:11] believe and
[2:27:13] tremble you did you know that Devils
[2:27:15] believe in baptism in the name of Jesus
[2:27:18] Christ but they're not
[2:27:20] saved did you know Satan knows that here
[2:27:24] oh Israel the Lord thy God is one is
[2:27:27] right but he's not saved because he
[2:27:30] refuses to obey the word you do know
[2:27:32] that brother brandham told us that if
[2:27:34] the devil would obey what he
[2:27:38] believed we know it's not going to
[2:27:40] happen but he said if he didn't he was
[2:27:42] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:27:43] he'd no longer be the devil he'd be your
[2:27:48] brother you've got to understand the the
[2:27:50] power of
[2:27:51] obedience and obeying God's word and
[2:27:54] knowing that you've been changed then
[2:27:56] you go to knowledge then you go to
[2:27:58] Temperance then you go to patience and
[2:28:00] you don't ask for patience you let God
[2:28:02] birth you through
[2:28:06] tribulation into patience and then
[2:28:10] godliness you're getting getting closer
[2:28:13] now he said oh our time's getting away
[2:28:16] let's
[2:28:18] see he said but but you know what godl
[2:28:21] has meant you've sang this song to be
[2:28:24] like Jesus to be like Jesus on Earth I
[2:28:27] long to be like him all through life's
[2:28:29] journey from Earth to Glory I only asked
[2:28:32] to be like him he said that's
[2:28:35] godliness when he was Smit on one side
[2:28:38] of the face he turned the other you want
[2:28:41] to know what godliness looks
[2:28:44] like it doesn't look like you crazy
[2:28:47] idiot you cut me off
[2:28:57] it doesn't look like hey I was in
[2:29:02] line wait your turn godliness looks like
[2:29:07] you have slapped me on this
[2:29:10] side I've heard denominational people
[2:29:13] say it's impossible to treat others like
[2:29:15] that it better not
[2:29:18] be because it's certainly weakens the
[2:29:21] reality of who Jesus is if he can't help
[2:29:24] you make that kind of a change in your
[2:29:26] life godlin is just saying hey you slap
[2:29:28] me over here let me give you another
[2:29:34] broadside n times out of 10 that'll
[2:29:37] diffuse the
[2:29:41] situation we read sometimes these
[2:29:43] stories of granny's that get broken in
[2:29:48] on somebody comes to steal their purse
[2:29:51] and they just start telling them about G
[2:29:53] you can take the
[2:29:54] purse just give me two minutes of your
[2:29:57] time that's right let me tell you the
[2:29:59] difference that Jesus can make in your
[2:30:01] life somebody said I just don't believe
[2:30:03] in that kind of Christianity you know
[2:30:04] why you've made it an entity you've made
[2:30:08] it a religious concept instead of the
[2:30:10] reality of knowing who Jesus is I want
[2:30:12] to be Godly oh I miss the Mark I'm
[2:30:16] telling you this is confession time I
[2:30:18] recognize in this
[2:30:21] I like my
[2:30:24] face I I I've never been a person who
[2:30:27] thought I was good-look so I don't mean
[2:30:30] that but I like my face I don't like for
[2:30:33] it to
[2:30:34] sting I don't particular like to be
[2:30:37] slapped I always told my children the
[2:30:39] face is personal space and it's off
[2:30:43] limits and nobody ought to be in that
[2:30:46] space I don't want anybody in my face
[2:30:50] but in order to show his
[2:30:53] godliness I may be tested in that
[2:30:56] area
[2:30:57] Godly always looking for one thing and
[2:31:01] here it is I always
[2:31:06] do I can't make that testimony this
[2:31:09] morning before you that I always
[2:31:12] do what pleases my
[2:31:16] father I can tell you that I sometimes
[2:31:19] do
[2:31:20] too I sometimes do what pleases my
[2:31:23] father but in order to be
[2:31:26] Godly I've got to always do that which
[2:31:29] pleases the father because that's what
[2:31:31] Jesus said he was his ministry he said I
[2:31:35] can't do anything unless my father shows
[2:31:37] me I can't say anything unless my father
[2:31:39] would show me there's going to be a
[2:31:42] bride she's
[2:31:44] here she's
[2:31:46] here
[2:31:48] she's let's go
[2:31:53] home she's
[2:31:55] here she's not perfect
[2:32:01] yet but when I see you all like I see
[2:32:04] saw you
[2:32:05] yesterday and like I see you when you're
[2:32:07] worshiping the Lord that's the image I
[2:32:09] always want of you when I see you come
[2:32:12] in here and I know you've got problems
[2:32:15] on upon problems upon
[2:32:18] problems when I know you worked so hard
[2:32:20] as some of you have worked this week
[2:32:22] long hard hours and yet you come in here
[2:32:25] on Sunday morning and you've got your
[2:32:27] you've got your praise
[2:32:29] on and when I look across this room and
[2:32:32] I see you in that moment or I see you
[2:32:34] being kind to one another are loving one
[2:32:36] another I realize the bride's here she's
[2:32:39] not coming she's here she's just in the
[2:32:44] process of being
[2:32:47] honed I believe the reason why he used
[2:32:49] the pyramid there are many reasons one
[2:32:53] is the new Heaven and the new Earth are
[2:32:54] going to look like that I recently saw a
[2:32:58] graphic of of the old Earth and I'm not
[2:33:00] going to argue with you about round or
[2:33:03] flat but my my thought is just
[2:33:06] round but the new Earth's not going to
[2:33:08] look like the old
[2:33:10] Earth it's going to be completely
[2:33:12] different it's going to be 1500 miles
[2:33:16] tall just like the scripture describes
[2:33:20] but it's going to be more pyramid shaped
[2:33:22] we see that as we as we approach this
[2:33:25] message and so that certainly would be a
[2:33:28] part of it but remember that as the
[2:33:30] pyramid got taller it gets more narrow
[2:33:34] it gets honed in you understand more
[2:33:36] narrow more narrow more narrow and
[2:33:38] really folks that's what's happening to
[2:33:42] us that's what's happening to
[2:33:45] us uh where am I
[2:33:50] in the same message paragraph 3:12 give
[2:33:53] me just a few more minutes 130 so I've
[2:33:56] got to
[2:33:57] stop but I'm going to be gone a week so
[2:34:00] I got to make up for it then sixthly
[2:34:03] let's add the Bible said here according
[2:34:05] adding Brotherly Love brotherly
[2:34:07] kindness now that's a good one right
[2:34:09] here the six seven all right adding
[2:34:11] brotherly
[2:34:13] kindness when we get to that brotherly
[2:34:17] kindness here he explains it so simple
[2:34:20] it's putting yourself in somebody else's
[2:34:23] place that's
[2:34:27] it it's so easy you know all cultures
[2:34:31] have described it you you you have no
[2:34:34] right to criticize an Indian until youve
[2:34:36] walked a mile in his moccasins all
[2:34:39] cultures have have some expression to
[2:34:41] help us understand it's it's putting
[2:34:43] yourself brotherly
[2:34:46] kindness It's when you can excuse me
[2:34:49] when you can put yourself in somebody
[2:34:53] else's
[2:34:54] place and try to
[2:34:57] understand why they're what they
[2:35:01] are it's our desire to want to change
[2:35:05] everybody and the reality of that is we
[2:35:08] want them to be just like
[2:35:10] us you know who we like we like the
[2:35:13] fundes that are just like us but that's
[2:35:16] not how we're going to be able to do
[2:35:17] this we got to be like Christ
[2:35:21] and what we've got to be able to do is
[2:35:22] to be able to place ourself in someone
[2:35:25] else's
[2:35:26] shoes and instead of letting criticism
[2:35:29] discourage us from praying for them we
[2:35:32] need to be able to say but by the grace
[2:35:36] of God I would also be
[2:35:39] bitter if God had not helped
[2:35:43] me I would also be
[2:35:46] resentful if God had not helped me I
[2:35:48] would also be
[2:35:50] jealous you begin to see where people
[2:35:53] have been it helps you understand where
[2:35:56] they are and it helps you to love them
[2:35:59] in spite of what you don't like about
[2:36:02] them I'm going to ask somebody to
[2:36:05] squeeze an amen
[2:36:08] out he said my brother sinned against me
[2:36:12] said
[2:36:13] Peter shall I forgive him he said seven
[2:36:17] times a
[2:36:18] day Jesus
[2:36:22] said not 70 not seven times a day 70 *
[2:36:28] 7 somebody said Oh you mean to tell me
[2:36:30] I've got to forgive somebody 490
[2:36:34] times and then I can hold him
[2:36:36] accountable
[2:36:38] no the question was how many times in a
[2:36:42] day wo I'm preaching and ain't nobody
[2:36:46] listening come on 400 90 times a
[2:36:53] day I'm telling you that's a
[2:36:55] villain if you've got somebody in your
[2:36:58] life that you have to forgive 490 times
[2:37:01] every day you won the
[2:37:03] lottery you've you've got somebody in
[2:37:06] your life that's going to make you
[2:37:07] perfect I mean when you come out of this
[2:37:10] you're going to smell like Jesus and
[2:37:12] walk like Jesus and talk like
[2:37:15] Jesus he said brotherly kindness now you
[2:37:18] see if a brother is All Out Of
[2:37:21] Tune
[2:37:23] oh you'll never accuse me of giving only
[2:37:26] scriptures and quotes that I
[2:37:30] like I don't like this
[2:37:34] one if a Brother's All Out Of Tune don't
[2:37:37] be
[2:37:43] impatient let's move
[2:37:47] on it's my biggest struggle
[2:37:51] I hate
[2:37:55] excuses I hate when people make
[2:37:58] excuses just get on get to church on
[2:38:05] time just do it leave
[2:38:09] early pick out your underwear the night
[2:38:18] before let me have a little
[2:38:21] water musicians you can start this
[2:38:26] way but I'm being tested here I'm being
[2:38:30] challenged here brotherly kindness you
[2:38:34] try to put yourself in somebody else's
[2:38:39] shoes you see your brother Out Of Tune
[2:38:42] you see your sister Out Of
[2:38:46] Tune don't be impatient with him
[2:38:50] or
[2:38:51] her be
[2:38:57] kind
[2:38:59] oh
[2:39:02] ouch be kind to him go
[2:39:06] anyhow somebody said not long ago said
[2:39:09] how can you believe these things the way
[2:39:10] you do and still go to the Assemblies of
[2:39:12] God and the Oneness all the
[2:39:14] rest see brotherly
[2:39:17] kindness hoping someday see patient with
[2:39:20] him temperent enduring with him
[2:39:22] knowledge to understand what he believes
[2:39:25] remember it's in his heart that's what
[2:39:27] is virtue in yourself to let go out with
[2:39:31] kindness meekness to him having faith
[2:39:35] that someday God will bring him in
[2:39:38] see we've treated people who don't
[2:39:40] believe this
[2:39:43] message
[2:39:45] bad
[2:39:48] bad
[2:39:50] and it's not the love of
[2:39:52] Christ hoping someday see you you you do
[2:39:56] it with love you you go where God opens
[2:39:58] the door you show kindness and love
[2:40:00] wherever you
[2:40:02] are believing that one day God will
[2:40:04] bring them
[2:40:05] in brotherly kindness the seventh Thing
[2:40:08] 1 2 3 4 5 six seven see seventh
[2:40:12] thing next thing then after those seven
[2:40:15] things you add charity you add agapo
[2:40:18] Divine love mature love he said that's
[2:40:22] the capping
[2:40:24] Stone and I close with
[2:40:27] this in Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[2:40:29] today and forever this this one got me a
[2:40:32] little
[2:40:33] bit John after he returned from the
[2:40:36] aisle of patmas out in the aan sea only
[2:40:39] thing he could say was little children
[2:40:41] love one
[2:40:42] another think about what he went
[2:40:45] through banished to the island of Patmos
[2:40:50] which means Patmos in Greek means my
[2:40:53] killing so he was banished to death to
[2:40:56] die there were vicious and wild animals
[2:40:59] that were kept on Patmos because it was
[2:41:02] a it had been a penal
[2:41:04] colony it been been a place where
[2:41:06] prisoners were banished to
[2:41:09] die John is brought back and burned
[2:41:12] boiled fried in oil not once history
[2:41:18] records
[2:41:20] twice two times he is thrown into a
[2:41:23] cauldron of burning hot oil they wanted
[2:41:27] to make a French fry out of John the
[2:41:30] Beloved the one that Jesus loved
[2:41:35] remember he comes back from all of these
[2:41:41] experiences and his message is
[2:41:45] not the seven Church ages he recorded
[2:41:48] that he did did his part he preserved it
[2:41:51] for our generation but that's not what
[2:41:53] he came back
[2:41:55] preaching his message was little
[2:41:58] children love one
[2:42:00] another if anybody had a reason to be
[2:42:03] bitter toward people religious people
[2:42:06] especially it would be John but he came
[2:42:08] back and his message was what little
[2:42:10] children love one another he found there
[2:42:13] was something
[2:42:15] real and I love the fact that brother
[2:42:18] Brandon reminds us that was the disciple
[2:42:20] that wanted to call fire down on the
[2:42:22] city and burn them
[2:42:25] up not because they rejected Christ but
[2:42:28] because they wouldn't feed
[2:42:32] him somebody said where's that in the
[2:42:34] bible let me show you before I finish
[2:42:36] that Luke 9 verse 5455 and when his
[2:42:40] disciples James and John saw this they
[2:42:42] said Lord wil thou that we command fire
[2:42:45] to come down from heaven and consume
[2:42:47] them even as Elias did
[2:42:49] but he turned and rebuked them and said
[2:42:52] ye know not what manner of spirit ye are
[2:42:56] of so here was the disciple that was
[2:43:00] ready to burn them up because they
[2:43:02] wouldn't give him a
[2:43:03] sandwich now he is sent to
[2:43:06] Patmos and he comes back and his message
[2:43:09] is very very simple you'd think it'd be
[2:43:11] complicated I mean he has seen the
[2:43:13] Harlot he's seen he's seen all of these
[2:43:16] visions that we read about in the
[2:43:17] Revelation I mean You' think he'd be
[2:43:19] raging against a organized religion you
[2:43:22] You' think he would be uh pulling up all
[2:43:24] the evils of of of of denominational
[2:43:27] systems and and his message is so simple
[2:43:30] now it has nothing to do with vengeance
[2:43:33] or judgment his message is little
[2:43:37] children
[2:43:39] love one
[2:43:42] another now back to the finishing of the
[2:43:44] quote he said but how Christ got a hold
[2:43:46] of him and let him know you don't know
[2:43:49] what kind of a spirit you are he said
[2:43:52] trying to destroy life we've come to
[2:43:55] save life that's what we have to have is
[2:44:00] love for one
[2:44:04] another Lord
[2:44:08] Jesus we are so
[2:44:12] thankful that you have loved
[2:44:16] us on our good days
[2:44:19] and on our rotten
[2:44:22] days your
[2:44:24] mercy your
[2:44:27] longsuffering your kindness and
[2:44:29] faithfulness toward us has strengthened
[2:44:33] and motivated us to run the
[2:44:37] race and today we are behooved we are
[2:44:42] compelled we're moved
[2:44:44] upon to ask for your
[2:44:47] help in loving each other each
[2:44:51] other Lord I often say that people come
[2:44:56] and visit here through the years and
[2:44:57] they say I I've I've I've rarely seen
[2:45:02] such a loving
[2:45:04] congregation and yet Lord we all
[2:45:07] know we're on the inside looking out and
[2:45:10] we all know how often we fall
[2:45:13] short how often we lose
[2:45:16] patience how often we criticize
[2:45:20] how often we
[2:45:22] judge without ever trying to walk in
[2:45:25] somebody else's shoes and today we just
[2:45:28] say Lord have mercy would you pray that
[2:45:32] with me Lord have
[2:45:34] mercy show us the way of
[2:45:37] love we are recognizing Jesus that when
[2:45:41] we get down to the end of all
[2:45:44] things we're not going to be judged
[2:45:46] according to how good we explain the
[2:45:50] Mysteries or how how uh intimately and
[2:45:55] and and intricately we can diagram the
[2:45:58] Thunders and what they
[2:46:01] said but the biggest question that's
[2:46:03] going to face us is did you learn to
[2:46:07] love Lord teach
[2:46:09] us there is no better
[2:46:14] example than
[2:46:16] yours you prayed father forgive them
[2:46:21] they know not what they
[2:46:23] do Lord I pray that you will allow your
[2:46:26] little
[2:46:27] bride to break forth from virtue to
[2:46:31] Virtue until we come to that place that
[2:46:35] we can be completely and ultimately
[2:46:39] sealed and the Capstone can come
[2:46:42] testifying to the world that you have a
[2:46:46] people that have moved into the stat
[2:46:50] of the perfect man who you were when you
[2:46:54] walk the face of the Earth thank you for
[2:46:57] grace and mercy thank you for for
[2:47:00] forgiveness Lord thank you for showing
[2:47:03] us the way give us strength to keep
[2:47:06] pressing on in the name of the Lord
[2:47:08] Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen let's
[2:47:12] stand together and let's Worship the
[2:47:14] Lord let's worship him let's see if we
[2:47:18] can come one more time before we leave
[2:47:21] today into his presence and be changed
[2:47:24] how many of you just say I have things I
[2:47:26] want his help with you just hold up your
[2:47:28] hand I have things that I want the
[2:47:30] Lord's help with I have situations that

[3:05:14] uh now they've come to the end of their
[3:05:16] time here and are moving back to
[3:05:19] Louisiana and we're going to certainly
[3:05:21] miss them but we're going to pray that
[3:05:23] the Lord will go with them and be with

[3:05:26] keep them next Sunday after the morning
[3:05:29] service we'll go outside and
[3:05:31] baptize uh in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:05:34] Christ if you've never been baptized in
[3:05:35] the name of Jesus you've never been
[3:05:38] baptized I don't mind to tell you
[3:05:41] that it's the word it's just what the
[3:05:44] Bible said and I would I wouldn't take
[3:05:46] the chance
[3:05:48] my grandmother had been an Assembly of
[3:05:50] God preacher woman and she had
[3:05:53] ministered for 40 years built three
[3:05:57] churches and when the truth came the
[3:05:59] real truth of baptism in jesus' name she
[3:06:02] had just a little while left to live
[3:06:04] cancer had taken her
[3:06:06] lung and she said now I know I've always
[3:06:10] criticized that she said I hadn't
[3:06:13] understood it but she said I want you to
[3:06:15] baptize me in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:06:17] Christ I don't want to go out into
[3:06:18] eternity wondering I want to know I've
[3:06:21] obeyed the word repent he said and be
[3:06:24] baptized every one of you in the name
[3:06:26] and we'll be doing that next Sunday
[3:06:28] anybody that wants to be baptized can
[3:06:30] would you pray for us this week a
[3:06:33] Benjamin and myself and Hawke as we make
[3:06:35] our final preparation for Africa I've
[3:06:38] been going for years 30 years to Ghana
[3:06:42] but I tell you it's a it just seems like
[3:06:44] a different environment these days and I
[3:06:46] want to make sure
[3:06:48] that we've got everything taken care of
[3:06:50] and all the bills are paid and
[3:06:51] everything's and you can forget if you
[3:06:53] don't make lists does anybody else have
[3:06:55] to make list would you just pray that
[3:06:57] the Lord will give us all three great
[3:06:59] wisdom and Leadership and to get
[3:07:02] everything done that has to be done
[3:07:03] while we leave and that God will show up
[3:07:06] there in a mighty way heal the sick the
[3:07:11] last time we were there the Lord healed
[3:07:12] a little girl that was crippled her legs
[3:07:14] so
[3:07:15] twisted and God healed her in such a
[3:07:18] beautiful way and I'd like to see the
[3:07:20] Lord come and show himself Mighty
[3:07:24] again father thank you for letting us be
[3:07:27] together

[3:07:37] you and we don't take it for
[3:07:40] granted we always hope that you'll be
[3:07:43] with us but we don't take it for granted
