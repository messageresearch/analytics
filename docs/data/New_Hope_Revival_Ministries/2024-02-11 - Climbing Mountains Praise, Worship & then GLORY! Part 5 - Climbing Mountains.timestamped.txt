[57:58] amen we're just thankful to be in the
[58:00] house of the Lord thankful that this
[58:03] many of you have uh either come through
[58:06] whatever sicknesses were going around or
[58:10] you have somehow press through to be
[58:12] here today but God is worthy to be
[58:15] praised his presence is already here
[58:18] amen I want you to be sensitive to the
[58:21] holy spirit because he's trying to move
[58:24] against a distracting Spirit he's trying
[58:26] to push it back and if you'll just be
[58:28] sensitive to the Holy Spirit I'll tell
[58:30] you what it's about but right now we're
[58:33] just going to wait and see uh when that
[58:35] atmosphere would just begin to shift a
[58:37] little bit but God knows he knows and
[58:40] he's here if the enemy shows up at
[58:43] church you can rest assure God's beat
[58:45] him
[58:47] here I know he's here I brought him with

[58:53] today how many of you know he rode with
[58:55] you amen you know you you've got to keep
[58:59] the conversation
[59:01] right you got to keep the atmosphere
[59:04] right when you're on your way it's
[59:06] important isn't it well God is good I I
[59:11] want to say a few things brother Henry
[59:14] is that
[59:16] you God bless
[59:23] you
[59:25] we missed you last
[59:27] weekend and someone was mentioning Henry
[59:30] and somebody told me got a haircut and
[59:34] nothing wrong with that and uh I kind of
[59:37] like short hair on men that's my
[59:41] tradition and uh I some I said I miss
[59:44] him I I said well first of all he hasn't
[59:47] spoken to me for
[59:51] permission I said he's announcing to the
[59:53] whole world that he's engaged and I
[59:55] don't remember I don't remember him
[59:57] coming to his other Papa and
[1:00:00] asking and I said the reason why I say
[1:00:03] that is because if you remember he was
[1:00:05] one of the first that came to visit us
[1:00:08] here and so we just feel like he's
[1:00:10] family I believe this is one of brother
[1:00:13] sto's daughter and her husband but I
[1:00:15] cannot remember your names but I
[1:00:18] remember those good-look boys and I saw
[1:00:21] their picture this week and I am so
[1:00:23] thankful that you all are here were you
[1:00:25] for a wedding or something we're very
[1:00:27] glad that you chose to come by our way
[1:00:29] and I'm glad that you are here I'm glad
[1:00:32] that the holy spirit is here and I'm
[1:00:35] glad that Kate is here I believe God has
[1:00:39] brought him and I'm so thankful for that
[1:00:41] he's been a blessing to us and uh I
[1:00:44] wanted to greet you this morning from
[1:00:46] Brother Josiah and sister Katie who were
[1:00:50] with us here for about a month and uh I
[1:00:54] was so blessed let's see I think it was
[1:00:57] Friday evening uh was still at the
[1:01:00] church a little late and uh he called
[1:01:04] and uh just had a wonderful talk with
[1:01:06] him and they're following our services
[1:01:09] and God is still using this place to be
[1:01:12] a blessing in their life and they are
[1:01:14] settled in Tucson now and they are at
[1:01:16] the Tabernacle with brother Daniel Evans
[1:01:20] and uh God is using them I watched the
[1:01:23] service last night for a little little
[1:01:24] while because uh they told me that
[1:01:27] brother brother Dwayne was here
[1:01:30] preaching on obedience and brother
[1:01:32] Daniel was out there preaching on
[1:01:34] obedience the same weekend so I thought
[1:01:37] well I'll listen to what brother Daniel
[1:01:39] had to say about it and it was
[1:01:41] compelling obedience is better than
[1:01:44] sacrifice some of what I'm feeling this
[1:01:47] morning is because somebody hadn't
[1:01:48] obeyed you know it's very very important
[1:01:52] to obey the Lord you know you may get by
[1:01:55] for a while not doing what God has told
[1:01:58] you to do but you won't get by
[1:02:00] forever I'm going to need some help on
[1:02:02] that you you won't get by forever when
[1:02:06] the spirit of God comes to you and tells
[1:02:08] you something you need to do in your
[1:02:10] life you better do it now we're going
[1:02:13] through a precious time in the spirit
[1:02:15] right now because there's a some of our
[1:02:17] folks are really seeking the Lord in a
[1:02:20] very uh special way and we're not
[1:02:23] talking about about it because the Bible
[1:02:26] tells us when we do things like that our
[1:02:28] arms before the Lord we don't let the
[1:02:30] right hand know what the left hand is
[1:02:32] doing but if you're going to enter into
[1:02:34] a time of consecration you need a prayer
[1:02:38] covering you need to let somebody know
[1:02:40] what's going on so that they can pray
[1:02:42] for you while you're in that season of
[1:02:45] consecration so we have a few folks who
[1:02:47] are really In the Heat of a time of
[1:02:51] consecration to the Lord and and uh you
[1:02:54] know still going on having to work and
[1:02:57] come to church and so forth but God sees
[1:02:59] what's happening there's victory at the
[1:03:04] end there's victory at the end and so we
[1:03:08] pray a covering over their lives and any
[1:03:11] of the rest of you who decide that you
[1:03:13] want to pull a side unto the Lord in
[1:03:16] whatever way you know I I believe that
[1:03:19] God sees our hearts and he knows what we
[1:03:21] are capable of doing and I I believe
[1:03:24] that anytime we make up our mind I want
[1:03:27] to give something up or put something
[1:03:30] aside to draw closer to the Lord he
[1:03:32] honors it whether it's a sabatical from
[1:03:35] social media that can certainly capture
[1:03:38] so much of our time or whether it's uh
[1:03:42] leaving off
[1:03:44] dessert you know for some people that's
[1:03:46] no
[1:03:47] sacrifice for those of us over 50 it's a
[1:03:51] sacrifice I used to laugh at the old
[1:03:54] timers when they would say I just crave
[1:03:56] sweets and I'd say well I crave biscuit
[1:03:59] and
[1:03:59] gravy but as you get older you you you
[1:04:02] just need it I just need a bite at least
[1:04:06] and so if you were to decide I'm going
[1:04:08] to I'm not going to have sweets I'm
[1:04:10] going to I'm going to lay that aside for
[1:04:12] a little season we're not Catholics and
[1:04:14] we don't observe lent but if you wanted
[1:04:17] to do that I believe God would honor
[1:04:21] that maybe you say well I I don't I I go
[1:04:24] I like to go to the gym or I like to I
[1:04:27] like to go to the thrift stores every
[1:04:29] week uh perhaps nothing wrong with
[1:04:32] either of those things but you might say
[1:04:34] Lord I'm going to lay that aside for a
[1:04:36] week or two I'm going to try to use that
[1:04:39] time more
[1:04:41] wisely I'm going to try to use that time
[1:04:44] to seek the Lord come on now maybe you
[1:04:47] would say I'm going to let my Monopoly
[1:04:49] go
[1:04:51] go and I'm going to let my video game go
[1:04:55] and I'm going to use that time to seek
[1:04:57] the Lord a little bit it's not the
[1:05:00] there's not just a need for one or two
[1:05:02] of us but there's a need for all of us
[1:05:05] brother brandom said you've gone as high
[1:05:08] with the Lord as you're ever going to go
[1:05:10] until you pay a greater price there's a
[1:05:13] greater price to be paid for a
[1:05:16] consecrated life and to hear God talk
[1:05:19] how many of you want to hear him talk to
[1:05:21] you you want to hear him speak to you
[1:05:24] your heart individually well he's a
[1:05:26] walking talking God he's still talking
[1:05:29] to his people if we have an ear to hear
[1:05:33] if you believe that say amen amen uh so

[1:08:49] them and he said one of them is the
[1:08:52] spirit of addiction
[1:08:54] and uh the other is the spirit of
[1:08:59] apathy and uh so I I have the
[1:09:02] definitions here and I believe there's
[1:09:05] somebody here who's dealing with some of
[1:09:08] these things well my God is greater and
[1:09:12] stronger and come on and these Giants
[1:09:16] have no right to talk to
[1:09:18] us addiction is the the fact or
[1:09:22] condition of being addicted to a
[1:09:23] particular particular substance thing or
[1:09:26] activity and so there are many things
[1:09:29] that we can that we can be addicted
[1:09:35] to it's not just alcohol or drugs some
[1:09:39] some marijuana or something it can be
[1:09:41] all of those things but it can be
[1:09:44] anything especially something that's not
[1:09:47] good or productive or or holy or help
[1:09:51] helpful or or something that gives
[1:09:54] toward our health instead of taking away
[1:09:57] from our health well I want you to know
[1:09:59] the Lord can deliver you lust becomes an
[1:10:02] addiction and it has various ways that
[1:10:05] it plays out in our life and uh there's
[1:10:09] a power that is greater than the you you
[1:10:12] you don't need uh you know you don't
[1:10:14] need sex anonymous or some kind of a
[1:10:18] program that they have you need to meet
[1:10:21] Jesus they've got programs for sexual
[1:10:24] addicts just like they do any other
[1:10:26] addict and you you don't need that if
[1:10:29] you will surrender to the Lord he will
[1:10:32] break that Spirit of addiction in your
[1:10:35] life and you'll be able to live a normal
[1:10:37] life not tormented by a spirit of lust
[1:10:40] or pornography there's victory for the
[1:10:44] believer I want to tell you something
[1:10:46] the Holy Ghost is not going to live in a
[1:10:48] dirty house let's see if I can get some
[1:10:51] help here I can't imagine the Holy Ghost
[1:10:54] watching
[1:10:57] filth I just know he wouldn't and so if
[1:11:01] we are that doesn't mean you haven't had
[1:11:03] an experience with God it doesn't mean
[1:11:06] that you haven't had a touch of the Holy
[1:11:08] Ghost in your life but he's not fully
[1:11:10] possessing you until you have the
[1:11:13] victory over those things I need some
[1:11:15] help today but where you haven't taken a
[1:11:18] text and the musicians are still there
[1:11:20] I'm still
[1:11:22] preaching and then that other Spirit of
[1:11:25] apathy or
[1:11:26] lethargy the word lethargy means a lack
[1:11:29] of energy and
[1:11:32] enthusiasm but it was
[1:11:35] apathy that that he
[1:11:38] spoke and
[1:11:41] uh apathy means a lack of
[1:11:45] Interest
[1:11:47] enthusiasm or concern I want to say that
[1:11:51] again I'm not preaching on this this yet
[1:11:54] I mean I that's not my text I got it
[1:11:57] here coming in a minute but apathy is
[1:12:00] the lack of
[1:12:01] Interest You Know The Enemy doesn't even
[1:12:04] want you interested in the things of
[1:12:06] God he wants the world to have such a
[1:12:09] pull on you or your
[1:12:12] buddies I want you to know it's all
[1:12:14] right to have friends that aren't
[1:12:15] Believers it's all right to have
[1:12:17] relationships with people that are not
[1:12:19] Believers but you better be careful how
[1:12:21] you make a buddy yes sir come
[1:12:24] on out of somebody that doesn't serve
[1:12:27] the god you serve Buddy's more than a
[1:12:31] friend I I I mean your Confidant the one
[1:12:35] you the one you want to be with the one
[1:12:37] you want to hang out with well you
[1:12:39] better know that that is somebody who
[1:12:41] loves Jesus
[1:12:43] Christ maybe they're Baptist but they
[1:12:46] love the Lord that's what they want to
[1:12:49] talk about at least from I I don't
[1:12:51] believe in being a Pharisee sayal I
[1:12:54] don't believe in being religious I
[1:12:56] believe that we can have conversations
[1:12:59] that are not uh uh Bible based we can
[1:13:02] talk about the weather if you want to
[1:13:05] fight you can talk about
[1:13:07] politics there are things you can talk
[1:13:10] about but my you find the truest
[1:13:14] Fellowship around the things of
[1:13:18] God so apathy is a lack of Interest
[1:13:21] enthusiasm or concern
[1:13:24] when you hear somebody say I don't
[1:13:28] care how many times you hear people say
[1:13:30] that I've heard people in this room say
[1:13:33] that I don't
[1:13:36] care so and so I don't care you don't
[1:13:40] have any concern that's what you're
[1:13:42] saying I don't have any concern well
[1:13:43] there are things that don't concern us
[1:13:45] and shouldn't concern us but our
[1:13:48] eternity should be first and foremost in
[1:13:52] our life we should be very concerned
[1:13:54] about eternity we should be very
[1:13:57] concerned about whether or not we are
[1:13:59] filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire we
[1:14:03] should be very concerned about our state
[1:14:06] of
[1:14:07] sanctification that is set apart from
[1:14:09] the
[1:14:12] world so I thought this morning I would
[1:14:15] just call a special service tonight
[1:14:17] about
[1:14:18] 7:00 how many of you'll join me
[1:14:21] here well good I'm only
[1:14:27] kidding you know this is what the world
[1:14:31] calls don't act like you don't
[1:14:34] know Super Bowl
[1:14:37] Sunday what I think that means is you
[1:14:39] get a bigger bowl of chili today than
[1:14:41] you would any other day or a bigger bowl
[1:14:44] of chicken noodle
[1:14:46] soup I don't care I don't care I happen
[1:14:51] to know who's playing because I've heard
[1:14:53] it over and over and over
[1:14:58] again it's Taylor Swift against the
[1:15:09] 49ers if if she walked in this room I
[1:15:12] wouldn't recognize
[1:15:19] her I know one thing if she's endorsing
[1:15:23] Mr Biden she doesn't have a full
[1:15:30] capacity if she thinks that that this
[1:15:34] man could serve this country well
[1:15:36] another four
[1:15:39] years she's got trouble that being
[1:15:42] blonde is not her problem it's much much
[1:15:45] bigger than
[1:15:46] that and it's all the world wants to
[1:15:48] talk about I think I told you some
[1:15:51] months ago that a con ERT she had in
[1:15:54] Washington state the crowd roared so
[1:15:58] loud it registered on the RoR
[1:16:02] scale it was reported all across the
[1:16:06] country and it could have been
[1:16:08] considered a mild
[1:16:10] earthquake can you imagine making such a
[1:16:13] noise over a a
[1:16:17] gal that you that you caus the RoR
[1:16:21] scale to register
[1:16:24] and then you come to church and sit on
[1:16:26] your
[1:16:27] [Music]
[1:16:29] hands or you catch this stream and you
[1:16:32] criticize us because we worship the Lord
[1:16:35] and there's a little emotion put into
[1:16:39] it you know I'm sick and tired of sports
[1:16:42] fans judging My
[1:16:45] Worship you've got something to get
[1:16:48] excited about over there well so do I I
[1:16:51] am most at home in the Pres of the Lord
[1:16:55] I've got something to get excited about
[1:16:57] the Blood Bought Church of Jesus Christ
[1:17:00] it's getting ready for a
[1:17:02] Rapture so in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:17:06] we expose the enemy now and we push back
[1:17:11] a spirit of apathy and a spirit of
[1:17:14] addiction and we call you out in the
[1:17:16] name of Jesus and we say to those
[1:17:19] affected by that Spirit you can be free
[1:17:23] you can be delivered you don't have to
[1:17:27] carry
[1:17:30] that you don't have to be under the
[1:17:34] influence or
[1:17:36] distraction of the enemy it's Jesus
[1:17:40] Christ the same
[1:17:43] yesterday and today and
[1:17:47] forever when I first came around the
[1:17:49] message they were singing that song from
[1:17:51] the 50s a lot let's talk about
[1:17:55] Jesus the King of Kings is he the Lord

[1:19:09] he the Lord of lords

[1:20:13] it amen that's
[1:20:16] good that's another great song I don't
[1:20:19] know how that got in there but that's
[1:20:20] another one but that one don't go with
[1:20:22] this far as I
[1:20:24] know we are blessed to have these
[1:20:28] musicians and uh I want to thank them
[1:20:30] for their
[1:20:31] [Applause]
[1:20:33] [Music]
[1:20:34] [Applause]
[1:20:37] labor I want you to turn with me again
[1:20:40] and I I just got a lot in my mind and on
[1:20:45] my
[1:20:46] heart and
[1:20:48] uh I hope you won't get mad for what
[1:20:52] I've just said
[1:20:53] said we we want to be
[1:20:56] free and if you thought there was
[1:20:58] condemnation in that you you
[1:21:00] missed you you missed it it it's it's
[1:21:03] not that at all but I don't understand
[1:21:07] why somebody would recognize their
[1:21:09] position and and know that it's not what
[1:21:11] they want and then and then choose to
[1:21:14] remain there the Bible said that uh
[1:21:17] excuse me the spirit of the Lord told us
[1:21:20] that this was a year for mountain
[1:21:21] climbing right and uh if you think that
[1:21:25] the Lord's going to come and pull you up
[1:21:26] the mountain you've got another thing
[1:21:29] coming he's not there to help us get all
[1:21:32] the way to the top until we have reached
[1:21:34] the end of our strength now you may
[1:21:36] think you've reached the end of your
[1:21:38] strength but you're not dead
[1:21:41] yet that's why we're still striving and
[1:21:44] struggling We're Not Dead Yet now he
[1:21:47] promised us when we've gone as far as we
[1:21:50] can go and we cannot go any farther
[1:21:54] first of all he promised us fire in the
[1:21:58] mountain that we could draw into our
[1:22:00] lungs into our spirit man the fire of
[1:22:04] God and be cleansed and purified and not
[1:22:07] only that but sustained and
[1:22:09] energized to continue to press on but
[1:22:13] there will again come a time when we
[1:22:15] can't go any higher and the word of the
[1:22:17] Lord came and said I'll bear you to the
[1:22:19] top on the wh on the wings of a white
[1:22:22] eagle
[1:22:23] that's right you won't have to climb the
[1:22:26] rest of the way by yourself I'll send a
[1:22:28] white eagle and he will come and take
[1:22:31] you all the way to the top and brother
[1:22:34] brandom tells us in the uh wings of a
[1:22:37] snow white dove I think it is he talks
[1:22:39] about that that white eagle that will
[1:22:41] sweep us in a a a fresh breath it's not
[1:22:46] a new message it's not a new messenger
[1:22:50] it's not a new revelation
[1:22:53] it's not an eighth messenger it's not a
[1:22:55] chief Apostle it's not a chief Prophet
[1:22:57] it's not an eighth
[1:22:59] guy but it's a fresh breath of God on
[1:23:02] the truth that we have heard that feels
[1:23:06] new it feels vibrant it feels
[1:23:10] alive it feels like a Revival for the
[1:23:14] bride and it takes us right all the way
[1:23:16] up to the top
[1:23:18] Glory we're gleaning in the word because
[1:23:22] the word is what's going to get us
[1:23:24] through it's not a feeling it's not an
[1:23:27] emotion it's not a
[1:23:29] gift it's the word that's going to take
[1:23:31] us all the way come on now amen and we
[1:23:35] need to pray I know you get tired of
[1:23:37] hearing such things but we need to pray
[1:23:40] more and we need to read our Bible more
[1:23:44] we need to know this word of God you
[1:23:46] don't know it by reading it you need to
[1:23:49] read it and then you need to begin to
[1:23:51] know it we know it by the spirit we know
[1:23:55] it by revelation we need to be so filled
[1:23:59] with the Holy Ghost that when we read a
[1:24:01] verse of scripture it so Thrills us that
[1:24:05] we could talk about it all night
[1:24:08] long one of the things that brother
[1:24:10] Josiah did he said I've been pondering
[1:24:13] on a verse of scripture brother Shel you
[1:24:15] care to talk about it with me sure he
[1:24:17] gave me one verse of scripture and we
[1:24:20] discussed it together and it just
[1:24:22] becomes life to you when the spirit of
[1:24:25] God comes and breathes on the word it's
[1:24:28] life to us so we are in a series about
[1:24:33] being
[1:24:34] surefooted because when I was told by
[1:24:36] the spirit this was a year of mountain
[1:24:38] climbing I was told be very
[1:24:41] surefooted and I asked I ask the Lord in
[1:24:45] this experience uh how will we know what
[1:24:48] can we do to prepare to help us to be
[1:24:51] sure footed and the Lord spoke five
[1:24:54] things into my spirit and the first one
[1:24:57] was that we should uh that we should
[1:25:00] keep our balance in the
[1:25:03] scripture and and I think that is so
[1:25:05] important today and the second thing is
[1:25:08] we should stay in the middle of the road
[1:25:11] not be carried away over here or carried
[1:25:13] away over there but but stay right in
[1:25:16] the middle ground because that's where
[1:25:19] that's the highest part of the road and
[1:25:22] then I heard that whatever we do we
[1:25:25] should praise until the spirit of
[1:25:28] worship comes and then worship until the
[1:25:31] glory comes and then stand in the
[1:25:34] glory and so I was going to this morning
[1:25:38] I I worked all evening last night uh
[1:25:41] finishing up the the fourth
[1:25:45] installment I knew that I had not
[1:25:47] finished the glory but I thought you
[1:25:51] know I'll I'll move on and I'll come
[1:25:53] back there's a danger in moving on and
[1:25:56] saying you're going to come back you
[1:25:58] don't always come back so as I woke up
[1:26:02] this morning I had that experience in
[1:26:05] the night where I got to church ahead of
[1:26:07] you and and saw that that Spirit of
[1:26:11] apathy and the spirit of addiction and
[1:26:13] was trying to deal with it in the realm
[1:26:15] of the spirit and then I woke up at
[1:26:19] 7:00 and the the Lord was dealing with
[1:26:22] my hard and I said no no I'm not moving
[1:26:25] on yet I'm not going to give in to the
[1:26:28] pressure I was feeling to move on I'm
[1:26:30] going to go back to where we were try my
[1:26:33] best to finish it up today and Tuesday
[1:26:36] and then be ready for next Sunday next
[1:26:38] Sunday morning and I am taking my time
[1:26:41] and I don't know why I am but I am you
[1:26:43] can tell I'm just not in any hurry to
[1:26:46] get to the meat of this but I will
[1:26:49] brother gy and sister gy are away this
[1:26:51] weekend visiting with family picking up
[1:26:53] some beef and I don't know if brother
[1:26:55] gley was ministering today I didn't hear
[1:26:58] if he was ministering while he was there
[1:27:01] sometimes he does uh but next Sunday
[1:27:05] he's going to stand up here and present
[1:27:08] to you our project that we have been
[1:27:11] preparing for down at the bottom of the
[1:27:13] hill uh he's got a little video that he
[1:27:16] wants to show you and and just going to
[1:27:18] tell you a little bit more about the
[1:27:19] details of what we're planning and I'm
[1:27:22] so excited I am so happy to think that
[1:27:26] we might have a place that we could sit
[1:27:28] down and fellowship together and not
[1:27:31] have to pitch the tent and not have to
[1:27:33] to be in the out in the elements and
[1:27:36] eventually not have to be in the
[1:27:38] heat I don't think the air conditioner
[1:27:40] will come first but it will eventually
[1:27:44] arrive praise the Lord but in the
[1:27:47] meantime it'll be nice to have a dry
[1:27:49] place and there's a lot going on there's
[1:27:52] going to be concrete poured in about a
[1:27:54] month and there's going to be quite a
[1:27:56] quite a few things take place and before
[1:27:58] it's over we're going to be able to
[1:28:00] utilize every inch of that Tabernacle
[1:28:04] that God gave us for his glory
[1:28:09] uh what is it uh is it 75 by 150 or is
[1:28:14] that right Nathan where is
[1:28:16] he say
[1:28:19] again not 75 by 50 the whole tabern
[1:28:23] so then it's 75 by 150 which is the
[1:28:26] exact uh Dimensions if you were to
[1:28:29] convert it to the Tabernacle in the
[1:28:31] wilderness so if you ever want to in
[1:28:33] your mind try to think about the size of
[1:28:35] the Tabernacle of the Wilderness you
[1:28:37] just look down there under that
[1:28:39] Tabernacle just before I came out here
[1:28:41] Tuesday night brother gy told me
[1:28:43] something that could be done that just
[1:28:46] shocked me I was so excited when I heard
[1:28:50] that it could be done
[1:28:52] you know we always hear the hardship or
[1:28:55] the difficulty of something I like it
[1:28:57] when somebody says that's what you want
[1:29:00] it can be done amen that's why that sits
[1:29:04] there three contractors marched off and
[1:29:06] said you'll never put that building
[1:29:09] there but one contractor Mr Webb
[1:29:12] Assembly of God man he said if brother
[1:29:14] Shelly sees it Pastor if you see it I
[1:29:17] can build it and if you saw it there
[1:29:20] that's where it'll sit
[1:29:23] that that right there shows you the kind
[1:29:25] of the theme of where we're moving
[1:29:27] toward so he will tell you some exciting
[1:29:30] things and uh yes I'm disturbed to how
[1:29:33] they're clearing the land we're going to
[1:29:35] be able to see right into somebody's
[1:29:36] backyard but I don't know but what God
[1:29:39] Will Make A Way and when they put the
[1:29:41] lot up for sale or the house up for sale
[1:29:43] you may buy
[1:29:45] it and if you don't I
[1:29:48] might one way or the other God knows
[1:29:51] what he's doing
[1:29:52] I had a dear friend encourage me this
[1:29:55] week that God knows what he is doing and
[1:29:58] that we need to trust him and i' I've
[1:30:02] got so many just little things I want to
[1:30:04] tell you but I got to get going now so
[1:30:07] I'll tell you sometime that's why we
[1:30:09] need a place to Fellowship so I can tell
[1:30:12] you some things what God is doing can I
[1:30:15] read you one thing while you're standing
[1:30:18] you know I spent 10
[1:30:20] years in a in a community that I was not
[1:30:24] familiar with everything they did was
[1:30:28] the opposite of what I
[1:30:33] think God called
[1:30:36] me I didn't understand it I don't
[1:30:40] understand it now but for 10 years I
[1:30:43] traveled around the world preaching to
[1:30:46] Pentecostal and charismatic
[1:30:49] conferences to we we would have have as
[1:30:52] many as 3 to 5,000 people and my wife
[1:30:55] the only one in the building with a
[1:30:57] skirt on when I would give a prayer call
[1:31:01] an altar call I would have to close my
[1:31:04] eyes or look up in the air to pray for
[1:31:09] people because the women were showing so
[1:31:13] much
[1:31:16] decolette that's shoulder and
[1:31:19] skin you don't have to be showing your
[1:31:22] female parts to to to be
[1:31:26] exposed
[1:31:27] hello I see sometimes people come in
[1:31:30] here a little bit with a little bit too
[1:31:32] much
[1:31:33] decolette I thought this morning I'm
[1:31:36] going to have to buy me some scarves to
[1:31:39] hand out to people sometime who need to
[1:31:41] cover up some of the
[1:31:42] decolette I love that
[1:31:46] word you know where I learned it
[1:31:50] Israel you are standing on the on the uh
[1:31:54] outskirts of the village of capernium
[1:31:58] cerom and you're getting ready to go in
[1:32:01] and view the ruins of of capernium and
[1:32:04] there are so many Catholics and Orthodox
[1:32:07] denominations who like to go there
[1:32:09] because of it being the home of Peter
[1:32:13] Peter's mother-in-law was there and so
[1:32:16] many like to go and and they know they
[1:32:19] know that all these tourists
[1:32:20] charismatics and Catholics and different
[1:32:22] ones will go in there and it's hot
[1:32:24] weather and the first thing they want to
[1:32:25] do when it's hot weather is
[1:32:27] undress so that that group that oversees
[1:32:30] that they put a big sign out there and
[1:32:32] explains to people you're going to have
[1:32:34] to cover up your
[1:32:36] decolette because we consider this to be
[1:32:39] a holy place it's just a bunch of rocks
[1:32:42] and ruins I said as I was standing there
[1:32:45] so many years ago and saw that sign I
[1:32:47] said if they care about these holy rocks
[1:32:50] come on
[1:32:52] if they care about this hole in the
[1:32:54] ground how much more should we care when
[1:32:56] we go into the house of the
[1:32:58] Lord I won't charge you any extra for
[1:33:00] that
[1:33:01] sermon but I didn't understand at times
[1:33:04] and sometimes I look back now and I say
[1:33:06] Lord what was it four 10 years of going
[1:33:10] going going
[1:33:12] going and at times you were of course
[1:33:15] you had great preaching and good
[1:33:17] leadership but at times you suffered
[1:33:20] some because I was not here and um even
[1:33:23] my
[1:33:24] family many times my
[1:33:27] children but I got an email this morning
[1:33:30] and I I just asked the Lord yesterday
[1:33:32] Lord confirm to me again and show me why
[1:33:35] you had me in that camp I love those
[1:33:39] people I love some of those people I
[1:33:41] fell in love with some of them but I
[1:33:43] have got to stand on the word for the
[1:33:45] hour and all of a sudden I had this
[1:33:47] little short email this morning uh it's
[1:33:51] it's titled testimony thanks I just want
[1:33:54] to thank you Pastor Shelly in this
[1:33:56] ministry in around 2010 Pastor Shelly
[1:34:00] came to Sheffield United Kingdom with
[1:34:03] PKD and I went to that conference and I
[1:34:07] was in the middle of escaping an abusive
[1:34:09] situation in my family there was an
[1:34:12] alter call for anyone who had panic
[1:34:15] attacks or Suicidal Thoughts I went for
[1:34:18] prayer and Pastor Shelly you prayed both
[1:34:21] boldly over me live and defy the enemy
[1:34:26] those words spoke to me and I've thought
[1:34:28] about them many times and it really
[1:34:32] helped and she signs her name live and
[1:34:36] defy the enemy is what the Lord told her
[1:34:39] and and that was
[1:34:40] 2010 and this is 2024 and guess what
[1:34:44] she's doing she's living and defying the
[1:34:47] enemy so I said Lord you have a
[1:34:50] reason
[1:34:55] hallah
[1:34:57] amen well I was going to start at the
[1:34:59] beginning but I I won't do that let's go
[1:35:01] to uh let's go to Ezekiel chapter
[1:35:06] 10 verses 3 through five that may take
[1:35:09] you a minute to find me charity but we
[1:35:13] are talking about the
[1:35:15] glory we praise until the oh I feel
[1:35:18] something now come on we praise until
[1:35:21] the spirit of worship comes upon
[1:35:25] us when we begin to praise we're not
[1:35:28] waiting on a
[1:35:29] Feeling we praise sometimes it's dry
[1:35:33] waiting in to
[1:35:35] praise sometimes it sounds Hollow
[1:35:38] sometimes our own voices of Praise sound
[1:35:41] silly in our
[1:35:43] ears we think somebody's going to watch
[1:35:46] us hear us they're going to think we're
[1:35:48] crazy our voice sounds so defeated as we
[1:35:51] begin to lift it up but if we will
[1:35:54] praise him because he's worthy not
[1:35:56] because we feel like it there's only two
[1:35:59] times to praise the Lord when you feel
[1:36:01] like it and when you don't and if we
[1:36:04] will do that every time we come into
[1:36:06] here in addition to how we praise him
[1:36:09] every day of Our Lives he will send a
[1:36:12] spirit of worship and when the spirit of
[1:36:15] worship comes it's like pouring oil on
[1:36:17] what you're doing and you begin to enter
[1:36:20] in and it's no longer such a hard thing
[1:36:23] because once the glory Comes The Glory
[1:36:27] as I'm going to tell you today or either
[1:36:29] Tuesday night if we don't get to it when
[1:36:31] the glory comes it brings an
[1:36:34] ease and when that ease comes upon us
[1:36:37] there's no more
[1:36:39] striving there's no more fighting to get
[1:36:41] in his presence envelops us like a
[1:36:46] shroud around our shoulders and for that
[1:36:49] few moments we stand alone with God
[1:36:54] Alone in the Holy presence of the Lord
[1:36:58] It's greater than a shot of vitamin B12
[1:37:02] it's greater than a Red Bull it's
[1:37:05] greater than anything you might do to
[1:37:07] give you a little pep I tell you getting
[1:37:09] in the presence of the Lord will
[1:37:12] energize you it will
[1:37:15] satisfy you but most importantly it will
[1:37:19] change you yes now the Cheri beam stood
[1:37:23] on the right side of the house when the
[1:37:26] man went in and the cloud filled the
[1:37:30] inner Court which is the holy place then
[1:37:34] the glory of the Lord went up from the
[1:37:40] Cherub as soon as I was saying that I
[1:37:44] was carried momentarily in my mind so
[1:37:49] that I could hear Brother brandom
[1:37:51] telling in the tent
[1:37:53] Vision how that glory of the Lord went
[1:37:58] and left the platform and hung over that
[1:38:02] little room he called it we now know
[1:38:05] that it wasn't a little room but it was
[1:38:08] a tent within a
[1:38:10] tent it was a small little structure
[1:38:13] there a stretch of canvas one time he
[1:38:16] called it a tent within a tent and the
[1:38:19] Lord said in that Vision just like he
[1:38:22] did in the scripture I will meet you in
[1:38:28] there that little tent doesn't represent
[1:38:30] a return Ministry of William brandham
[1:38:34] that little tent represents a bridal
[1:38:36] chamber a nupal chamber a HOA a hoopa if
[1:38:41] you will a place where bridegroom and
[1:38:45] Bride come together and they are no
[1:38:48] longer
[1:38:50] individuals on this day many years ago
[1:38:53] brother brandham preached the sermon
[1:38:55] Oneness and in that little holy place
[1:38:58] where the presence of God is to us it's
[1:39:01] like the holy of holies it's in there
[1:39:04] where we are most
[1:39:06] changed from glory to glory how many of
[1:39:10] you want to spend some time in there in
[1:39:14] the Holy presence in the cavod in the
[1:39:16] glory of the Lord in the bridal chamber
[1:39:20] that's he saying into thy chamber be
[1:39:23] free Holy Spirit Speak to Me Gently as I
[1:39:28] close the door Heavenly lover let thy
[1:39:32] presence cover shakina unending is all I
[1:39:36] long for somebody said if you're longing
[1:39:40] for the presence of God aren't you kind
[1:39:42] of leaving God out are you kidding come
[1:39:44] on God is where his presence is where
[1:39:48] his presence is God is if if you're
[1:39:51] hungering to be in the presence of the
[1:39:53] Lord You're hungering to stand before
[1:39:55] the Lord it's all the same then the
[1:39:59] glory of the Lord went up from the
[1:40:01] Cherub and stood over the threshold of
[1:40:03] the house and the house was filled with
[1:40:06] a cloud and the court was full of the
[1:40:09] brightness of the Lord's Glory
[1:40:12] Hallelujah Hallelujah and the sound of
[1:40:15] the cherubim's Wings Was Heard even to
[1:40:20] the outer Court as the voice of the
[1:40:23] almighty God when he
[1:40:28] speaketh this writer you may be seated
[1:40:31] may God add his Blessing to the reading
[1:40:33] of his word stay with me this writer is
[1:40:38] comparing the sound of the cherubim's
[1:40:42] Wings as they
[1:40:44] worship in the presence of the Lord as
[1:40:49] though it were the voice of God
[1:40:52] thundering out in the sanctuary of the
[1:40:56] Lord there's something about the Cherry
[1:40:59] beams that we as the bride of Christ
[1:41:03] have an identity
[1:41:05] with the Cheri beams were originally
[1:41:09] they were Guardians of the glory of the
[1:41:12] Lord they were angels of his presence
[1:41:16] they were those who stood most close to
[1:41:19] the Lord
[1:41:21] and to his holy throne in his holy house
[1:41:25] and the Bible tells us that when Adam
[1:41:27] and Eve failed the
[1:41:30] Lord that they were driven out of the
[1:41:35] garden that was in
[1:41:37] Eden they left the garden of delight and
[1:41:41] they went out into the land of Eden and
[1:41:43] into the land Beyond because we call it
[1:41:45] the Garden of Eden but Eden was a bigger
[1:41:47] place than the garden the Bible talks
[1:41:50] about Eden and then it talks about a
[1:41:52] garden that God built in inside of Eden
[1:41:57] and brother brandom so beautifully
[1:41:59] describes Adam and Eve they are they are
[1:42:03] downcast their heads are hanging and the
[1:42:07] Bloody skins that God Almighty has
[1:42:11] ripped off of the animals in the garden
[1:42:15] and
[1:42:16] dressed Adam and Eve because those fig
[1:42:19] leaves and by the way it wasn't a face
[1:42:25] mask when they took fig leaves off the
[1:42:29] tree it wasn't their mouths they
[1:42:32] covered it wasn't their mouths like
[1:42:34] eating of a piece of fruit or something
[1:42:37] that made them unclean or naked in the
[1:42:39] sight of the Lord they covered their
[1:42:41] most intimate parts and yet the rest of
[1:42:44] them remain naked before the Lord so the
[1:42:47] Bible tells us that God himself came
[1:42:49] down and made made them coats of skin
[1:42:53] and brother brandom describes it so
[1:42:54] beautifully there they go walking out
[1:42:57] arm in arm with one another and the
[1:43:00] Bloody
[1:43:01] skins still striking the backs of their
[1:43:04] legs as they walked out and God put
[1:43:07] those holy Cherry
[1:43:09] beams plac them at the going end of the
[1:43:13] garden and the Bible simply says we like
[1:43:16] to say they were there to keep Adam and
[1:43:19] Eve out that's what the Bible says the
[1:43:22] Bible says they were placed there to
[1:43:27] guard what the
[1:43:31] way they were placed there to guard the
[1:43:35] way to the tree of life it doesn't mean
[1:43:38] that no man will ever be allowed to get
[1:43:41] to the tree right how many of you are
[1:43:43] glad you found your way but it means
[1:43:47] that it won't be just a happen stance or
[1:43:50] some haphazard approach if you make it
[1:43:53] all the way to the tree of life and you
[1:43:56] receive the life of Jesus Christ into
[1:43:59] the innermost part of your being you're
[1:44:02] going to have to pass by the Cherub
[1:44:03] beams to get
[1:44:05] there so we know that the Cherub beams
[1:44:09] though they are Heavenly Creatures
[1:44:10] created to worship God and they are
[1:44:15] comparable even to the four living
[1:44:18] creatures that we really about in The
[1:44:21] Book of the
[1:44:23] Revelation they are directly somehow
[1:44:26] connected to the overcoming bride of
[1:44:29] Jesus Christ and so if cherubim's
[1:44:33] worship this bride is going to have to
[1:44:35] find her
[1:44:36] way into the spirit of
[1:44:41] worship they're going to have to praise
[1:44:44] until the spirit of worship comes the
[1:44:47] anointing to worship comes and then
[1:44:50] worship until the glory comes and when
[1:44:54] the glory comes you stand under and in
[1:44:57] the glory because you want it to have
[1:45:00] its maximum effect in your life is
[1:45:03] anybody with
[1:45:04] me I want you to be with me if you
[1:45:06] possibly can this glory is an important
[1:45:11] Concept in the message Revelation CH 4
[1:45:14] number three uh paragraph 276 brother
[1:45:18] brandham said let's see Isaiah the sixth
[1:45:21] chapter this young Prophet had been
[1:45:24] leaning on the arms of the Good King I
[1:45:26] read this to you and he had brought him
[1:45:28] all kinds of nice clothes and he was a
[1:45:31] prophet and he got along all where but
[1:45:33] one day the king died so he had to shift
[1:45:36] for himself so he went down to the
[1:45:39] temple to pray that was a good idea
[1:45:42] because he began to get out from amongst
[1:45:44] where the king's place was now he's this
[1:45:49] this Good Old King King was a good holy
[1:45:51] man but he got out and he seen how the
[1:45:54] people were living so he got down to the
[1:45:56] temple now listen and brother brandham
[1:45:59] quotes the scripture in the year that
[1:46:01] King osiah died I saw the Lord sitting
[1:46:04] upon a throne
[1:46:07] high high and lifted up and his train
[1:46:12] filled the temple not his Cho choo train
[1:46:15] but the train of his robe filled the
[1:46:19] temple brother random said Glory what's
[1:46:22] his train there it is Angels beings his
[1:46:27] train that followed him the trains what
[1:46:31] comes behind it was the glory of the
[1:46:34] Lord it was those angels that had been
[1:46:37] created to stand in the presence of the
[1:46:40] Lord and worship Him day and night they
[1:46:44] cry holy holy holy what did they say
[1:46:48] Church Holy Holy holy worthy worthy
[1:46:55] worthy you want to call that vain
[1:46:58] repetition I wouldn't do it if I were
[1:47:02] you I'd say that when you get in that
[1:47:05] presence of the Lord one Hallelujah is
[1:47:09] not
[1:47:11] enough when you get in that presence of
[1:47:13] the Lord one praise the Lord is not
[1:47:16] enough one glory to God is Not Enough
[1:47:20] you just stand there and you just want
[1:47:22] to say hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:47:26] hallelujah
[1:47:29] hallelujah
[1:47:31] 10,000 praises to God Hal halel Hal
[1:47:38] 10,000 praises to God now don't you be
[1:47:41] like the denominational people who stand
[1:47:44] on Sunday and sing Oh for a thousand
[1:47:47] tongues to sing my redeemer's praise
[1:47:51] and then not use the one tongue you have
[1:47:55] what would you do with a thousand
[1:47:57] tongues if you don't use the one you've
[1:47:59] got to praise the
[1:48:03] Lord I mean I'm not exaggerating when I
[1:48:06] tell you I wish sometime when I get in
[1:48:09] that presence that I had a thousand
[1:48:12] tongues every one of them saying
[1:48:15] hallelujah hallelujah the Lord Almighty
[1:48:19] reth the Lord God omnipotent is high and
[1:48:23] lifted up Hallelujah and is
[1:48:26] train his holy
[1:48:29] attendance those angels of his face
[1:48:33] those angels of his presence stand
[1:48:36] before him my God they don't just go
[1:48:40] before him they come behind him brother
[1:48:42] brandom said like the train of a wedding
[1:48:45] robe my
[1:48:47] glory glory somebody say Glory glor I
[1:48:53] showed you this the word Glory Appears
[1:48:57] 402 times in
[1:49:00] 371 verses in the
[1:49:03] Bible it's used to describe the Splendor
[1:49:07] and Majesty of God's presence it comes
[1:49:10] from the Hebrew word cavod or cabode
[1:49:14] which means
[1:49:19] weighty
[1:49:21] when you're
[1:49:23] moving in the outer
[1:49:25] recesses of an anointing the
[1:49:28] anointing you might be able to move
[1:49:31] about dance about run
[1:49:36] about uh jump
[1:49:38] about we've got this one woman who's
[1:49:41] commenting on all of our
[1:49:44] reals she has been burnt by holy
[1:49:48] dressing people
[1:49:50] she's been burnt by those who worship
[1:49:53] and
[1:49:55] jump and she just waits for another reel
[1:49:57] to come out Miss Rose she just waits for
[1:50:01] another reel to come out where's the
[1:50:04] preaching she said so we recommend
[1:50:07] someone sister Anna recommended how to
[1:50:10] get to the sermon and she just preaching
[1:50:12] is just not in her grid for now so to
[1:50:14] speak that's kind of what she said I'm
[1:50:16] I'm adding a little word there that she
[1:50:17] didn't use grid but basically listening
[1:50:20] to preaching is not what I do then why
[1:50:22] did you
[1:50:25] ask when you saw us worshiping the Lord
[1:50:29] why did you write on there where's the
[1:50:31] preaching now if there's anybody in this
[1:50:34] church that feels
[1:50:36] cheated in the preaching
[1:50:40] Department hello if you feel like you
[1:50:43] don't get enough preaching here I'd like
[1:50:46] for you to tell me where you can go and
[1:50:48] get anymore you might get better
[1:50:52] preaching somewhere else you may get
[1:50:55] more concentrated preaching somewhere
[1:50:57] else but I don't think you'll get more
[1:51:02] preaching we believe in
[1:51:05] preaching I'd rather preach than Eat
[1:51:07] Fried
[1:51:09] Chicken it's what I was born to
[1:51:12] do but but you know there always jumping
[1:51:16] she said is a is a new modern form of
[1:51:19] work worship oh my goodness get in the
[1:51:23] presence of God as you're waiting your
[1:51:26] way in through praise and you may jump a
[1:51:28] little bit of sacrificial
[1:51:31] jump you may dance a little sacrificial
[1:51:35] dance the old Pentecostals didn't think
[1:51:38] they could praise unless something took
[1:51:40] a hold of them and arrested them and
[1:51:43] force them to
[1:51:47] praise who wants to force their children
[1:51:50] to brag on Mom and
[1:51:53] Daddy what kind of a God would want to
[1:51:55] force you to Praise by arresting you of
[1:51:59] spirit and you didn't have any control
[1:52:01] you just had to praise him that's not
[1:52:04] how praise works it's sacrifice it's
[1:52:06] offering like I said a moment ago it's
[1:52:09] praising him when you don't feel like
[1:52:11] praising him then the glory comes the
[1:52:13] presence of God comes and You Begin so
[1:52:16] always somebody always
[1:52:18] somebody was listening to a marvelous
[1:52:21] sermon yesterday preached by another uh
[1:52:24] a wonderful uh real real Preacher Man
[1:52:27] and I was so blessed by many things that
[1:52:29] were said and I'll share more of it with
[1:52:32] you perhaps at another time because I as
[1:52:36] my family sat down to dinner last night
[1:52:38] we don't always have a Saturday dinner
[1:52:40] all together but we had a Saturday night
[1:52:43] dinner last night all together uh just
[1:52:46] like we had the night before Friday
[1:52:47] night all together but as we we sat down
[1:52:50] I said I heard a sermon today I want
[1:52:53] every one of you to hear and I said if I
[1:52:55] had my way I would desire that every
[1:52:58] message person in the world especially
[1:53:02] in the United States would be
[1:53:06] chained I didn't realize how this
[1:53:08] sounded until I played it back to in my
[1:53:10] mind Chained and staked to the pavement
[1:53:14] come on
[1:53:15] now and forced to listen to that sermon
[1:53:19] before you let him loose now I know that
[1:53:21] almost sounds
[1:53:23] abusive come on now but at the moment I
[1:53:27] was so
[1:53:28] inspired by what I heard and the balance
[1:53:32] that was being presented that I thought
[1:53:34] and I still think it today I may not I
[1:53:37] may not encourage someone to chain you
[1:53:39] down and stake you to the pavement but I
[1:53:41] might at some point share the sermon
[1:53:44] with you and you at your leisure if you
[1:53:47] can give it your entire time
[1:53:50] uh it wasn't that long of a sermon took
[1:53:53] me nearly 5 hours to get through it
[1:53:56] because I kept pausing it and I looked
[1:53:59] up every scripture and I looked up every
[1:54:02] quote and I thought this is a real
[1:54:04] balance on the gifts it's a real balance
[1:54:07] on a lot of different things but one of
[1:54:09] the things that was spoken was
[1:54:11] concerning
[1:54:13] songs and he said you know many people
[1:54:16] fail to realize that many of the songs
[1:54:20] that brother brandham sang were written
[1:54:23] in his
[1:54:25] generation therefore in his
[1:54:28] generation they would have been called
[1:54:31] modern worship
[1:54:35] songs brother he made a reference to the
[1:54:39] only believed book and he said this has
[1:54:42] been
[1:54:43] mandated yes I'm paraphrasing a little
[1:54:46] bit this has been mandated as though by
[1:54:49] Church Church order that every church
[1:54:52] should sing out of the only believe book
[1:54:55] and he said because surely these songs
[1:54:57] must be
[1:54:59] kosher if brother brandham sung
[1:55:02] them and so he said you've got people
[1:55:04] out there that won't even sing a song of
[1:55:07] worship if it doesn't appear in the only
[1:55:10] believed song book he said doesn't that
[1:55:13] sound like a denominational
[1:55:16] [Music]
[1:55:18] spirit he said there were songs in that
[1:55:21] book even there were songs that were
[1:55:24] sung in the meetings that were were
[1:55:26] written in that particular
[1:55:30] generation which would have made them
[1:55:32] modern which means that we are not bound
[1:55:35] to sing a song Only from the only beli
[1:55:39] song book or Believer song book we got
[1:55:42] two depending on whether you're you know
[1:55:46] using Canada's song book or or United
[1:55:49] States song book One come out of Canada
[1:55:51] one come out of the states both lovely
[1:55:54] books both lovely songs in them lots of
[1:55:57] the Beautiful song but he said some of
[1:56:00] these songs were new at the
[1:56:03] time so that doesn't mean that anointed
[1:56:07] songwriting ceased a generation
[1:56:11] ago I don't like the spirit that goes
[1:56:14] with some of the way these songs are
[1:56:15] presented
[1:56:18] today when I look at these uh music
[1:56:22] videos that the worshippers you know put
[1:56:24] out uh sometimes it looks more like a
[1:56:27] production than it does a worship
[1:56:30] service the way they dress you know in
[1:56:33] their in their worst
[1:56:37] jeans you know somebody pay all kind of
[1:56:40] money
[1:56:41] $70 for a pair of wor out
[1:56:46] jeans you know the truth is if some of
[1:56:49] you are early you'd be doing the same
[1:56:52] thing I see a tendency among some of us
[1:56:55] uh liking the trend and we'd be right in
[1:56:57] that
[1:57:02] Trend kind of a spirit thing you know
[1:57:05] sir like a woman in high heels it's not
[1:57:08] just the shoe we got to watch
[1:57:10] for because I've seen women around this
[1:57:13] message in flats that Twisted every part
[1:57:16] of who they are come on now when they
[1:57:19] walk down the aisle that's a spirit to
[1:57:22] draw attraction to
[1:57:25] themselves that's the way a lot of
[1:57:27] people that's a reason a lot of people
[1:57:28] do the things they do is because they
[1:57:31] want everybody to see
[1:57:35] them my that's good preaching come on
[1:57:38] Pastor tell it tell it tell it tell it I
[1:57:41] see these some of these worship people
[1:57:43] will send me songs to listen to and I
[1:57:46] always go and check out the video and I
[1:57:48] think oh my goodness
[1:57:50] this is utter
[1:57:52] confusion it's such a mixture of the
[1:57:54] world but there's nothing wrong with the
[1:57:56] song I said so let's bring that song
[1:57:59] into a different
[1:58:03] atmosphere oh don't you think that's
[1:58:05] borrowing from the world every one of us
[1:58:07] have done that every day of Our Lives
[1:58:09] come
[1:58:11] on you don't go to the you know we don't
[1:58:14] have our own
[1:58:15] tailor so we all go out there and buy
[1:58:18] our clothes we have to pick can choose
[1:58:19] through what we get but we go out there
[1:58:21] most of the time to get them so it's not
[1:58:24] like we can't take something and bring
[1:58:26] it in and sanctify
[1:58:29] it put our spin on it and our anointing
[1:58:33] on it and sing it to the glory of God
[1:58:35] some just I notice there are some that
[1:58:37] won't make the
[1:58:39] transition there's certain music out
[1:58:41] there you can't bring into this presence
[1:58:44] it just won't accomplish what it's meant
[1:58:47] to accomplish and when when that happens
[1:58:50] we know that there's a spirit on it that
[1:58:52] we don't want no part of but again I
[1:58:55] love the fact that this preacher was
[1:58:56] telling his people a a song doesn't have
[1:58:59] to be written in the 50s or 60s to be
[1:59:01] kosher enough to sing around the message
[1:59:03] of
[1:59:04] Truth
[1:59:05] amen do you know what kind of spirit
[1:59:08] that is a pheric spirit it's a spirit of
[1:59:11] the
[1:59:13] Pharisees don't get that on you if we
[1:59:17] happen to sing a song that's not your
[1:59:18] preference waddle your way through it
[1:59:21] muddle your way through it press your
[1:59:23] way through it your favorite song is in
[1:59:25] the
[1:59:26] mix it's not about
[1:59:30] you it's not about the worship
[1:59:33] leader it's about him anybody with
[1:59:37] me all right so that word glory for the
[1:59:40] glory listen for the glory to be
[1:59:42] manifest there must be a place for it to
[1:59:44] dwell we have to build a landing place
[1:59:48] for that shakina Glory Shak glory of the
[1:59:53] Lord in the message Israel and the
[1:59:56] church number two are you still with me
[1:59:58] there's a lot of meat to come so hang on
[2:00:01] in paragraph 137 brother vam said he
[2:00:05] seen God's glory what's he referring to
[2:00:08] Moses Moses Cried Out Lord show me thy
[2:00:15] Glory I want to remind you that he
[2:00:18] prayed that after he had seen God's
[2:00:20] Mighty Deliverance to the children of
[2:00:24] Israel he'd seen the Miracles that God
[2:00:27] performed to bring them out and sustain
[2:00:29] them in the wilderness but having seen
[2:00:32] what God can do was not enough seeing
[2:00:36] signs and wonders and miracles Moses had
[2:00:39] seen the pillar of fire Moses had seen
[2:00:42] the pillar of
[2:00:43] cloud Moses had seen food provided and
[2:00:47] water provided in super natural ways and
[2:00:50] yet after seeing all the
[2:00:52] Miracles he still said Lord show us show
[2:00:58] me yes I'm not satisfied with Just
[2:01:02] Praise and offerings of worship I want
[2:01:05] to see your
[2:01:07] glory and here's brother brandom's take
[2:01:09] on that he's seeing God's glory what is
[2:01:13] God's glory then miracles signs wonders
[2:01:17] and Divine Healing show me your glory
[2:01:22] Lord now we know that's just one element
[2:01:25] I'm not I I believe that I agree with
[2:01:27] that I say Amen to that but that's only
[2:01:30] one element of
[2:01:33] Glory here's the thing you've got to say
[2:01:35] and no you can't call it Glory if it's
[2:01:39] not producing the character and the
[2:01:41] nature of God his nature is to do
[2:01:45] Miracles his nature is to show signs his
[2:01:48] nature natur is to show wonders his
[2:01:51] nature is to show up and heal the sick
[2:01:53] come
[2:01:54] on so if you're going to have the glory
[2:01:56] you're going to have some of those
[2:01:57] things with it because where the glory
[2:02:00] comes God's Works come but it's not just
[2:02:04] about his
[2:02:05] works it's about beholding his face and
[2:02:09] being
[2:02:10] changed are you with me so we were
[2:02:13] together last we talked about it seemed
[2:02:15] like it's been a long time since I
[2:02:17] preached so I may need 4 hours
[2:02:24] today or just like I said one about 7:00
[2:02:32] tonight you can you can bring your ures
[2:02:36] and eat them in the car when we're
[2:02:40] done
[2:02:46] uh I made it funny and I lost my train
[2:02:48] of the thought now's your chance to say
[2:02:51] bless him Lord help him Lord let me hear
[2:02:54] you help him Lord bless him Lord touch
[2:02:58] him
[2:02:59] Lord I want to get back on track here
[2:03:02] for just a moment Moses built the
[2:03:05] Tabernacle as we read few weeks ago I
[2:03:08] was talking about not
[2:03:10] preaching brother Dwayne has did such a
[2:03:12] wonderful job for us how many of you saw
[2:03:14] the podcast this week any of you see it
[2:03:16] in its entirety oh well we'll just
[2:03:19] prepare it for the rest of the world and
[2:03:21] you won't see
[2:03:23] it if somebody tells me you don't have
[2:03:26] time you didn't have time I don't
[2:03:28] believe you for one
[2:03:30] second let me go back to saying little
[2:03:33] less go go little less bubble
[2:03:39] bust little less
[2:03:43] netflex you could watch that podcast and
[2:03:47] it would be a blessing to you you
[2:03:50] testimonies are already coming in of
[2:03:52] what a blessing it was because brother
[2:03:54] Dwayne shared so many beautiful parts of
[2:03:56] his testimony and then he was here
[2:03:58] preaching last weekend so it feels like
[2:04:00] I have not preached in a long time what
[2:04:03] I was going to say to you was another
[2:04:05] great point that that that preacher made
[2:04:08] in his sermon he was talking about
[2:04:11] church order and he said you know
[2:04:13] brother brandom said the sermon should
[2:04:15] last somewhere between
[2:04:17] 30 and 4 45
[2:04:20] minutes well I would like this is me now
[2:04:23] I'd like to call your attention to how
[2:04:25] many
[2:04:28] sermons brother Brandon preached that
[2:04:30] were 30 to 45
[2:04:33] minutes not
[2:04:35] many somebody said well he was a prophet
[2:04:38] he had something to say if you're called
[2:04:40] of God to preach you better have
[2:04:42] something to say
[2:04:46] to and then he went on in another
[2:04:48] referen this preacher went in to make
[2:04:50] another quote and he told us where
[2:04:52] brother brandham talked about sometimes
[2:04:53] you need a 4-Hour
[2:04:58] Meal look how quiet it
[2:05:00] got he said sometime you just want to
[2:05:02] eat for four
[2:05:05] hours I wish you'd want to eat for 4
[2:05:08] hours so we can get through two this
[2:05:11] morning say amen amen we talked about
[2:05:14] Jesus Christ being the manifestation of
[2:05:17] God's glory yes sir we talked about in 2
[2:05:20] Corinthians chapter 31 17 and 18 and
[2:05:24] let's look at 18 in the Amplified 2
[2:05:28] Corinthians 3:18 and the Amplified it
[2:05:30] said but we all with open face this is I
[2:05:35] thought this was the Amplified I don't
[2:05:37] know what that is that's the that's the
[2:05:38] classic I'm not reading I guess from the
[2:05:40] classic but we all with open face
[2:05:43] beholding as in a glass the glory of the
[2:05:48] Lord are changed into the same image
[2:05:53] from glory to glory that's King James
[2:05:56] isn't it from glory to glory even as by
[2:06:02] the spirit of the lord we mirror the
[2:06:07] glory of the Lord we reflect the glory
[2:06:11] of the Lord the word change there is
[2:06:14] metamorpho or the word that we would
[2:06:17] borrow from metamorpho which is
[2:06:21] metamorphosis which is going in like a
[2:06:23] worm and coming out like a butterfly how
[2:06:26] many of you would like to crawl your way
[2:06:29] into the glory of the Lord like an old
[2:06:32] inchworm and come out on the other
[2:06:36] side remember what he told us about that
[2:06:39] little room on the
[2:06:41] inside he said they'll go in one way and
[2:06:44] come out another
[2:06:46] way when God allowed me to re visit that
[2:06:49] place in the spirit he showed me that
[2:06:52] very thing happening people going in
[2:06:55] with their problems with their Hang-Ups
[2:06:58] not just physical deformity but also
[2:07:01] inward
[2:07:04] infirmity inner healing needed but when
[2:07:08] they came out the other side they had
[2:07:10] lost all of their
[2:07:12] intimidations they had lost all of their
[2:07:16] Hang-Ups and their warts and the
[2:07:19] problems that they had had their
[2:07:21] inferiority complexes listen if you can
[2:07:24] get in the glory of the Lord and stay
[2:07:27] there long enough you'll lose all of
[2:07:31] your
[2:07:34] complexes brother brandom confessed he
[2:07:37] said I have
[2:07:39] complexes you spend enough time in the
[2:07:42] glory of the
[2:07:44] Lord you'll lose your
[2:07:46] complexes if you believe that that's
[2:07:49] amen then don't rush us through praise
[2:07:51] and
[2:07:52] worship
[2:07:55] right then don't rush us out of here at
[2:07:57] the end of a
[2:07:59] service if you really believe that if
[2:08:02] you really believe that you'll want to
[2:08:05] linger just one more
[2:08:07] moment when he
[2:08:09] comes he's always here but I'm talking
[2:08:11] about when he comes with that heavy that
[2:08:14] heavy presence that arrests us it glues
[2:08:16] us almost to our seats right
[2:08:19] I've been in that presence where I could
[2:08:20] hardly lift my head up because I I I was
[2:08:25] so arrested by the
[2:08:28] weightiness of his glory
[2:08:30] presence and so it's in that that we
[2:08:33] receive that metamorpho that change
[2:08:36] we're changed into another image which
[2:08:40] is the image of Christ we're changed
[2:08:43] from our fallen nature image to a
[2:08:45] redeemed nature to a redeemed image
[2:08:48] image if you believe that say Amen the
[2:08:50] realm of Glory is the is is the realm of
[2:08:54] Eternity it is the revelation of the
[2:08:57] presence of God it is the manifestation
[2:09:00] of his presence he is Glory he is
[2:09:03] everywhere but glory is the
[2:09:05] manifestation of that
[2:09:08] reality God's everywhere but glory is
[2:09:11] not everywhere when we are in the glory
[2:09:14] we are in a manifestation of the fact
[2:09:19] that God's glory has come Among Us the
[2:09:22] Bible tells us that Jesus is the express
[2:09:26] image and he is the
[2:09:28] manifestation of the glory of God in the
[2:09:32] message God keeps his word I've got to
[2:09:35] stay focused now and hurry along I don't
[2:09:38] know who you are sister Betty but thank
[2:09:40] you for every one of your
[2:09:42] amens on on
[2:09:45] YouTube and and as I said that I got
[2:09:47] another one from brother Paul drown
[2:09:50] thank you for your virtual amens
[2:09:52] sometimes they're very very important
[2:09:54] especially when it gets so quiet in here
[2:09:57] say amen God keeps his word he said if
[2:10:02] it's for salvation if it's for Divine
[2:10:04] Healing if it's for blessing if it if
[2:10:06] it's for anything that God promised make
[2:10:11] Footprints every place the soul of your
[2:10:13] foot sets that have I given you for a
[2:10:16] possession let me go on down to where
[2:10:18] it's highlighted the fire is moving on
[2:10:20] let's move
[2:10:21] on from glory to
[2:10:25] glory can you read that out loud from
[2:10:29] experence experience Bible days are here
[2:10:33] again this little bride can live from
[2:10:35] one Bible experience to another Bible
[2:10:39] experience if God ever did it once he's
[2:10:42] able to do it
[2:10:43] again if you believe that say Amen if
[2:10:46] God sent a glory cloud that was so thick
[2:10:49] the priest could not stand to minister
[2:10:51] by reason of the cloud if God ever did
[2:10:54] that before he can do it
[2:10:56] here he can do it again if the pillar of
[2:10:59] fire that led the children of Israel out
[2:11:02] parted the Red Sea hell the waters back
[2:11:05] if God did it then he can manifest the
[2:11:08] pillar of fire visibly right here among
[2:11:11] us if we have the faith to believe if
[2:11:13] you believe that say
[2:11:15] Amen in the message unveiling of God it
[2:11:18] shall come to pass in the last days
[2:11:20] sayith God the light over the world is
[2:11:22] the light of the sun changes the seed
[2:11:25] from glory to glory we also become more
[2:11:27] like him as we
[2:11:31] live this is the
[2:11:34] inheritance of the
[2:11:38] Bride I can't see a promise for the
[2:11:42] church to live in his presence but I can
[2:11:47] see a promise that the bride as she's
[2:11:50] changed from glory to glory will be able
[2:11:54] to
[2:11:58] live
[2:12:00] live in his presence like him being
[2:12:05] conformed to his blessed image as we
[2:12:08] what as we walk with him watch what the
[2:12:12] sun does you plant a seed what happens
[2:12:15] the seed rots but inside the seed seed
[2:12:18] inside the shell of the seed is what
[2:12:22] that life comes forth and brings forth
[2:12:24] the stock now that don't look like the
[2:12:27] first the stock doesn't look like the
[2:12:29] seed that went into the ground there's a
[2:12:31] Luther it was a stock all right the
[2:12:33] stock went on and the first thing you
[2:12:36] know it brought forth the tassel see
[2:12:38] that was the wesland Revival wasn't like
[2:12:40] the
[2:12:42] other how many of you know the stock
[2:12:44] stage and the tassel stage is a
[2:12:47] different stage
[2:12:48] then Along Came the then the Westland
[2:12:51] Revival wasn't like the other then Along
[2:12:52] Came the Pentecostal Revival brought
[2:12:55] forth what the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:12:58] have we done away with
[2:13:00] justification have we done away with
[2:13:03] sanctification then why should we desire
[2:13:06] to put the Holy Ghost
[2:13:09] out it's all part of the promised
[2:13:11] restoration if you believe that squeeze
[2:13:13] an amen skipping down to paragraph 3:14
[2:13:17] but God is still there to make that just
[2:13:19] the same notice what does it do it
[2:13:24] finally
[2:13:26] returns back to
[2:13:30] [Music]
[2:13:33] what do not
[2:13:36] misunderstand our
[2:13:38] cry back to
[2:13:41] Pentecost there's not even one part of
[2:13:44] me that wants to go back to
[2:13:46] denominational
[2:13:48] Pentecost there's not even one part of
[2:13:51] me that wants to go back to 1906 isua
[2:13:55] Pentecost I want to go back to the
[2:13:58] original
[2:14:00] [Applause]
[2:14:02] Pentecost the one where you don't have
[2:14:04] to jump up and down and
[2:14:07] try to speak in
[2:14:13] tongues that's their favorite
[2:14:16] quote
[2:14:20] jump up and down and try to speak in
[2:14:23] tongues that's referring to
[2:14:25] Pentecost under a denominational system
[2:14:27] the little bride don't have to jump up
[2:14:29] and down and try to do
[2:14:32] anything she's filled with the Life of
[2:14:35] Christ she's filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:14:38] so talking in tongues is no problem for
[2:14:42] her she doesn't have to
[2:14:44] strive she doesn't have to put on she
[2:14:48] doesn't have to work it up it's in
[2:14:52] her see the
[2:14:54] difference anybody see the
[2:14:57] difference you see here's what
[2:15:02] happened Pentecost made that terrible
[2:15:05] mistake they put a
[2:15:07] period where God was putting a
[2:15:11] comma just like the modern Pharisees of
[2:15:13] the message who have done the very same
[2:15:15] thing they put a period
[2:15:18] where there is a comma to be and he
[2:15:21] moves on and he moves on and he moves on
[2:15:24] the pillar of fire keeps moving it keeps
[2:15:27] moving it keeps moving it keeps
[2:15:29] revealing Jesus Christ I know we've had
[2:15:31] the revelation of Jesus Christ but he
[2:15:33] keeps revealing himself to us in
[2:15:35] personal
[2:15:37] ways he keeps revealing himself to you
[2:15:39] in personal ways everybody still here
[2:15:43] good let's see what time
[2:15:45] 110 imagine that
[2:15:48] we have plenty of time but in the end it
[2:15:51] goes all the way back to the original
[2:15:53] seed again you see here's what Pentecost
[2:15:56] did when they put the period there then
[2:15:58] they began to say well you you you got
[2:16:00] to we got to know whether or not you've
[2:16:02] got the Holy
[2:16:05] Ghost so AA Allen was running around
[2:16:08] with the tent and God was doing great
[2:16:10] things in AA Allen's life we should be
[2:16:13] careful how we criticize but like all
[2:16:16] other preachers he could get it wrong
[2:16:18] just like anybody else could get it
[2:16:19] wrong just like brother brandom could
[2:16:21] get it wrong and had to come back and
[2:16:23] correct his own
[2:16:24] self he may not need you to correct him
[2:16:27] because he came back many
[2:16:31] times right right streamer come on now
[2:16:34] and corrected himself right and so a
[2:16:38] Allen got this thought that because oil
[2:16:40] started flowing in their hands and I
[2:16:42] don't mind to tell you I've seen that
[2:16:46] manifestation there may be dozens or
[2:16:49] hundreds of people who faked it but I
[2:16:52] saw it in my life in my childhood I saw
[2:16:56] oil not sweat not water oil forming in
[2:17:00] hands I just said glory be to God God
[2:17:03] can do anything he wants to do we didn't
[2:17:06] make a Doctrine out of it but AA Allen
[2:17:09] made a Doctrine out of it and began to
[2:17:11] tell people if you if you want to know
[2:17:13] you've got the Holy Ghost here is the
[2:17:16] manifestation wow just like the seven
[2:17:18] Thunder people under Joseph Coleman were
[2:17:20] going around the world saying you won't
[2:17:22] know that you've got it until you fall
[2:17:24] out in the spirit come
[2:17:27] on I believe in in being slain in the
[2:17:31] spirit I believe in being overcome by
[2:17:34] the spirit of God but that's no that is
[2:17:36] no
[2:17:39] evidence but the Pentecostal
[2:17:41] denomination said if you don't speak in
[2:17:43] tongues you don't have the Holy Ghost
[2:17:45] which led people to believe if I speak
[2:17:47] in Tong Tong I have the Holy Ghost and
[2:17:49] that's the highest peak on now that's
[2:17:52] the highest place you can go you think I
[2:17:54] want to go back to that where we had to
[2:17:56] jump up and down and
[2:17:58] try because if we didn't speak in
[2:18:00] tongues we were told we don't have it
[2:18:02] you see what a pressure that puts on
[2:18:05] people if I would have been preaching
[2:18:07] that all these years some of you would
[2:18:09] have lived under that pressure next
[2:18:11] thing you know you'd have jumped up and
[2:18:12] down and tried to talk in tongues right
[2:18:16] all you get is a little you know a
[2:18:18] little twist on the
[2:18:20] tongue but when the genuine Holy Ghost
[2:18:22] comes you don't have to jump up and down
[2:18:25] and try to do anything
[2:18:27] right on the day of Pentecost the
[2:18:30] disciples didn't jump up and down and
[2:18:32] try
[2:18:33] to they just open their mouth
[2:18:37] hello

[2:28:57] brandom's
[2:28:58] words but the concept is according to

[2:29:06] made perfect realization completed
[2:29:10] realization
[2:29:11] hallelujah hallelujah read
[2:29:14] on we have been looking through a glass

[2:29:52] vine isn't that wonderful yes it is we
[2:29:56] are complete in him that is true he

[2:30:03] day we will be changed in the
[2:30:06] Adams we will put on immortality we will
[2:30:10] be all swallowed up in life then we will
[2:30:13] realize realization that will be real
[2:30:18] realization that will be real reality in
[2:30:23] that moment if you believe that say Amen
[2:30:26] 2 Corinthians
[2:30:28] 318 in the Amplified look at it I need
[2:30:31] just a few more
[2:30:33] minutes and all of us as with unveiled
[2:30:37] face because we
[2:30:41] contined to
[2:30:43] behold in the word of God as in a mirror
[2:30:48] the glory of the
[2:30:50] Lord are constantly
[2:30:54] being transfigured into
[2:30:58] his do you see the importance of the
[2:31:00] glory yes there's no hope of ever being
[2:31:04] just like him unless we stand in the
[2:31:08] glory and while we stand in the glory we
[2:31:12] hold to the word we're not hold holding
[2:31:16] to the
[2:31:18] sensation we're not clinging to the good
[2:31:21] feeling thank God for it we are standing
[2:31:24] in the glory clinging to the word of God
[2:31:28] we are constantly being transfigured

[2:31:51] could say you know Pastor I believe at
[2:31:53] some point in my Christian experience I
[2:31:57] have
[2:31:59] experienced uh a
[2:32:02] degree of the glory of God and I want to
[2:32:05] testify to it hold up your hand if
[2:32:07] you're not sure that's okay but look at
[2:32:09] these hands what if I told you there's
[2:32:12] another
[2:32:14] degree see what are we doing this Year

[2:32:18] mountains on now there's another degree
[2:32:21] of Glory Hallelujah how do we get to it

[2:32:31] glory to glory it's by by by staring at
[2:32:34] him by focusing on him by looking at the
[2:32:38] word of God as in a mirror the glory of
[2:32:42] the Lord manifest are constantly being
[2:32:44] transfigured into his very own own image

[2:36:05] anybody if you come in here Sunday after
[2:36:08] Sunday the same condition the same way
[2:36:10] you've always come in doesn't it appeal
[2:36:12] to you to think you might have an
[2:36:14] opportunity it's not in my
[2:36:19] hands so so those of you who pray during
[2:36:22] the week I wish brother Shel would come

[2:36:26] shell would come and talk to me I wish
[2:36:28] brother Shelly would come and tell me
[2:36:29] what's wrong with me that's what I'm
[2:36:31] doing right

[2:36:38] you and you do something for you and
[2:36:41] I'll be there to cheer you on from one
[2:36:45] degree of Glory glory to another from
[2:36:48] one realm of power to another Now read
[2:36:51] Romans 1:17 King James and Amplified
[2:36:55] quickly for therein is the righteousness
[2:36:58] of God revealed from Faith how how is it
[2:37:02] revealed Faith to Faith so we're moving
[2:37:05] from strength to
[2:37:07] strength amen we're being changed from
[2:37:12] glory to
[2:37:14] glory and the righteousness of God is
[2:37:18] being revealed to us not all at one
[2:37:22] time but from Faith to Faith did you
[2:37:26] know that as your faith grows your
[2:37:28] revelation of his righteousness
[2:37:31] grows oh say that again somebody did you
[2:37:35] know did you know that as your faith
[2:37:37] grows your revelation of his
[2:37:40] righteousness also
[2:37:42] grows and as it is written what the just
[2:37:46] shall live by faith the just shall live
[2:37:48] by faith this coming from the from
[2:37:50] Martin Luther I mean Paul wrote this of
[2:37:53] course but but Martin Luther using this
[2:37:55] verse of scripture he's climbing up and
[2:37:57] down the the the the the steps of
[2:38:00] witberg Chapel trying to pay for his own
[2:38:07] sins he nipped a little too much
[2:38:12] beer his language was too coarse
[2:38:16] you ever read the writings of Martin
[2:38:19] Luther he wasn't the Saint the church
[2:38:22] has made him he was human he struggled
[2:38:26] every step of the way he spent a lot of
[2:38:30] time in the confession
[2:38:34] Booth he spent a lot of time literally
[2:38:37] climbing the steps on his knees reciting
[2:38:41] Rosary
[2:38:43] prayers to try to get some kind of
[2:38:46] peace right for the inner war that was
[2:38:50] within him some of you know that war
[2:38:53] right some of you have experienced that
[2:38:55] war one day he's got his Bible in his in
[2:38:58] his hand somebody said I think that
[2:38:59] might be a legend I don't care where he
[2:39:01] was when he got it he got it but I like
[2:39:05] to put him on his knees trying to pay
[2:39:07] for his own sin reading the Bible
[2:39:10] climbing up and down on his bloody knees
[2:39:13] when all of a sudden he runs that
[2:39:15] scripture
[2:39:16] from therein is the righteousness of God
[2:39:18] revealed from Faith to Faith as it is
[2:39:21] written the just shall
[2:39:25] live not by
[2:39:29] Rosary not by
[2:39:32] indulgences not by by putting a coin in
[2:39:36] the Coffer to Spring somebody's soul
[2:39:38] from purgatory right on now not by going
[2:39:42] in the confession booth and drawing the
[2:39:45] curtain and confessing to a
[2:39:52] homosexual that spirit is predominant
[2:39:54] and prevalent in that in that hor system
[2:39:57] of Rome we're not talking about precious
[2:39:59] people caught in that system we're
[2:40:01] talking about spirits that predominantly
[2:40:03] Prevail so you're going to go in there
[2:40:05] and tell your sin to somebody who's in
[2:40:08] worse shape than you
[2:40:09] are and all of a sudden you get this
[2:40:12] Revelation woo I'm not living from
[2:40:15] confession to
[2:40:17] confession I'm not living from Penance
[2:40:20] to penance I'm living from Faith to
[2:40:24] Faith because the
[2:40:26] [Music]
[2:40:28] just I'm not living by the length of my
[2:40:32] hair or what I
[2:40:35] wear or whether I cover my head with
[2:40:38] long hair or with a
[2:40:40] cap I'm living from Faith to Faith and
[2:40:45] the just shall do
[2:40:47] what let me show you a
[2:40:50] quote from someone you're familiar
[2:40:54] with it's from from the from a book from
[2:40:57] a
[2:40:58] manuscript possessing Bridal
[2:41:03] inheritance it's back on the old notes
[2:41:06] you see I'm jumping around here you
[2:41:08] still here even though your eyes are
[2:41:10] Walling around in your head cuz you're

[2:41:19] someone else to read
[2:41:23] it the adopted sons of the
[2:41:26] kingdom are about to be
[2:41:29] commissioned and sent forth with the
[2:41:32] full authority of their
[2:41:35] father whatever he shows them they will
[2:41:38] do and whatever he says they will
[2:41:43] say most importantly whatever they
[2:41:50] say he will
[2:41:53] perform what a
[2:41:55] promise what a
[2:41:57] promise shy goes on to
[2:42:01] say I mean you know you know brother

[2:42:11] you've arrived when you start quoting
[2:42:14] yourself

[2:42:19] I wanted to get it in there next
[2:42:23] next I
[2:42:25] believe that this maturing
[2:42:30] process is greatly
[2:42:34] accelerated how many of you want to
[2:42:36] mature in
[2:42:37] him what if I told you it takes place in
[2:42:40] a particular
[2:42:42] atmosphere you got to get in that
[2:42:44] atmosphere to grow up and him I believe
[2:42:47] that this maturing process is greatly
[2:42:49] accelerated as we spend time with our
[2:42:52] bridegroom alone in the
[2:42:55] Hoopa when we linger with him yes it's
[2:43:00] when we are
[2:43:03] changed read it glory to glory from
[2:43:07] glory to glory now musicans are
[2:43:11] coming I'm going to read two more
[2:43:18] verses we're on page
[2:43:23] 20 that gives us
[2:43:26] about 10 more pages for Tuesday

[2:43:33] Sunday we can get ready for number
[2:43:38] four I will give you a
[2:43:40] hint we're
[2:43:43] not Valentine's Day
[2:43:46] celebrators
[2:43:48] here it has Pagan
[2:43:52] roots and those who try to religious it
[2:43:56] those who try to make it spiritual have
[2:43:58] to do so by borrowing from the church
[2:44:01] system of Rome the very one that God is
[2:44:04] opposed
[2:44:06] to the very one that has done more
[2:44:09] damage to truth than any other system
[2:44:13] the Roman system the Roman Church system
[2:44:16] that paple system has done more to
[2:44:19] destroy truth than any other system ever
[2:44:23] created and organized by man so you want
[2:44:26] me to go and adopt and borrow Pagan
[2:44:29] cultures and ways so that I can tell my
[2:44:32] wife I love her why don't you do that
[2:44:35] every
[2:44:36] day why don't you take her candy every

[2:47:26] detail but next Sunday the the the
[2:47:28] fourth part is about
[2:47:30] love it's about our
[2:47:33] responsibility in love I Heard a Voice
[2:47:37] who spoke to me about love you might
[2:47:39] make the guess of what it was all about
[2:47:42] but I was
[2:47:43] reminded that it's vitally
[2:47:46] important vitally important that we
[2:47:48] learn to love now everybody has their
[2:47:51] own concept I don't care what your
[2:47:53] concept is about love we're going to
[2:47:55] find out what's the Bible
[2:47:58] concept well if I don't if I don't get
[2:48:00] it this way if it's not said to me this
[2:48:02] way blah blah blah I don't feel loved
[2:48:04] listen we're not even talking about that
[2:48:07] we're talking about loving people the
[2:48:09] Bible Way and in doing so we have a
[2:48:13] great responsibility
[2:48:15] because perfect faith and perfect love
[2:48:17] run together and we've been told we're
[2:48:21] not going to get out of here into that
[2:48:23] place without
[2:48:25] mature that's what perfect
[2:48:28] means mature
[2:48:34] love if every other virtue in our life
[2:48:37] has to come to
[2:48:38] maturity so does
[2:48:41] Love and mature love
[2:48:46] it's about loving the
[2:48:51] unlovable anybody can love a sweet
[2:48:54] little
[2:48:56] granny but it's loving the
[2:48:59] unlovable loving the
[2:49:03] complicated you got anybody in your
[2:49:06] life sir my goodness I just thought
[2:49:08] about some of you you've got dozens
[2:49:11] complicated people in your life no
[2:49:13] wonder you come in here beat down some
[2:49:14] time you're worn out by all the
[2:49:17] complicated people in your life and and
[2:49:19] to be honest with you you're not so
[2:49:20] simple
[2:49:24] yourself yes
[2:49:26] sir yes sir get out of my
[2:49:32] head but we learn to love and When Love
[2:49:36] Comes to maturity
[2:49:38] yes then it's so much
[2:49:43] moreen
[2:49:45] and that's what we're going to be on
[2:49:47] next week let me read this in closing
[2:49:49] the musicians are already here Isaiah
[2:49:51] 4:5 you still got the mic why don't you
[2:49:54] read it in the King James for me because
[2:49:56] I want to tell you something else that
[2:49:57] Glory produces in her
[2:50:00] life and the Lord will create upon every
[2:50:03] Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and upon
[2:50:06] her assemblies a cloud and smoke by day
[2:50:11] and The Shining of a flaming fire by
[2:50:13] night for upon all the glory shall be a
[2:50:18] defense this verse is not referring back
[2:50:21] to how God has operated in the past this
[2:50:25] is a prophetic utterance concerning a
[2:50:27] future installment of God's
[2:50:30] glory it's not just National Israel as
[2:50:34] we know her today but it's also the
[2:50:36] reality of spiritual Israel and
[2:50:40] spiritual Israel is both Jew and Gentile
[2:50:44] together as one new man serving the lord
[2:50:48] in the beauty of his
[2:50:49] word and the Bible said through the
[2:50:52] prophet Isaiah and the Lord will create
[2:50:55] upon every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion
[2:50:57] and upon her assemblies her Gatherings a
[2:51:00] cloud and smoke by day and The Shining
[2:51:03] of a flaming fire by night for upon all
[2:51:06] the
[2:51:08] glory not only is the glory a changing
[2:51:11] agent in our life but the glory is a
[2:51:16] protection the glory is a
[2:51:19] shelter the glory is a defense in our
[2:51:24] lives when we experience the glory when
[2:51:28] we eventually mature and begin to walk
[2:51:31] in the glory it will protect us that's
[2:51:34] right it will shelter us it will defend
[2:51:39] us read it in the
[2:51:43] Amplified and the Lord will create over
[2:51:45] the whole sight over every Dwelling
[2:51:48] Place of Mount Zion and over her
[2:51:51] assemblies a cloud and smoke by day and
[2:51:54] The Shining of a flaming fire by night
[2:51:57] for over all the glory shall be a canopy
[2:52:01] a defense of divine love and protection
[2:52:05] a
[2:52:09] hoopa the Tabernacle the word Tabernacle
[2:52:12] the word canopy
[2:52:15] is often from the word
[2:52:19] Hoopa which is more than just a
[2:52:22] tent it's a nupal
[2:52:25] tent it's a tent of
[2:52:28] intimacy the more we spend time in the
[2:52:32] presence of God developing a personal
[2:52:35] and intimate relationship with him the
[2:52:37] more we
[2:52:39] enjoy his glory that protects us and

[3:01:10] [Music]
[3:01:11] Praise Lord
[3:01:13] [Music]
[3:01:18] High Jesus
[3:01:23] Christ let me ask those of you that are
[3:01:25] standing here the closest to the altar
[3:01:27] would you step back and en join the
[3:01:30] others just would you all back up just a
[3:01:32] little bit
[3:01:35] please back up just a little bit
[3:01:37] more thank you so
[3:01:40] much what I want to do is I want us to
[3:01:44] take just a moment to to push that
[3:01:47] Spirit back out of your
[3:01:48] life if you're here and there is some
[3:01:53] witness to you
[3:01:55] that you
[3:01:57] have you you know I believe that you
[3:01:59] don't have to be possessed with with
[3:02:01] something for it to have
[3:02:05] control I believe there's an oppression
[3:02:07] that a spirit can operate against you
[3:02:11] with and I believe you can be anint
[3:02:14] OED by a spirit that's not of
[3:02:19] God so if you can identify with what I
[3:02:23] dealt with in the night last night if
[3:02:25] you could say brother Shelly I I realize
[3:02:28] that sometimes a spirit of
[3:02:30] apathy I lose concern I lose interest I
[3:02:33] lose
[3:02:35] enthusiasm sometimes it works against
[3:02:38] me and it causes me to be distracted and
[3:02:41] I'd like to have victory
[3:02:44] over that in my life or maybe you would
[3:02:47] say I realize that I have an
[3:02:51] addiction or that I have a tendency to
[3:02:54] addictive
[3:02:55] behaviors that are not good for me that
[3:02:59] are not building me up in the faith but
[3:03:02] have become a distraction to me and I'd
[3:03:06] like for the Lord to give me strength to
[3:03:08] be able to push the spirit of apathy or
[3:03:12] push the spirit of
[3:03:14] addiction back out of my life I don't
[3:03:17] want a part of that and if you're here
[3:03:19] and you have some witness to that I want
[3:03:21] you to step forward among those that are
[3:03:25] standing there I want you to step closer
[3:03:27] to the Altar and if you're not in the
[3:03:29] front I want you to come and join us in
[3:03:31] the
[3:03:32] front even if you're on the music I want
[3:03:35] you to come
[3:03:38] down but we want to deal with that thank
[3:03:41] you so much for being so
[3:03:45] honest and I think it's easier for you
[3:03:47] to do that when we when we talk about
[3:03:51] the various ways you know this is not
[3:03:54] your pastor saying you got a
[3:03:56] demon this is your pastor saying you you
[3:03:59] are impeded and hindered weighted down
[3:04:03] sometime by either apathy trying to take
[3:04:06] a hold of your life or
[3:04:08] addiction and not to be crazy here but
[3:04:11] you can actually become addicted
[3:04:14] to
[3:04:15] apathy to a lack of concern some people
[3:04:19] habitually
[3:04:20] walk without any
[3:04:23] concern for others in their
[3:04:26] life and for what's going on I find I
[3:04:29] find it every day as a
[3:04:31] leader that human nature is to be so
[3:04:35] caught up in what you're going through
[3:04:39] at the moment that you lose sight that
[3:04:42] anyone else is in a battle or that
[3:04:45] anyone else is in a struggle and one of
[3:04:47] the marks one of the Hallmarks of mature
[3:04:51] love of perfect love is to come to a
[3:04:55] place where it's nearly easier for you
[3:04:58] to see where others are and what they're
[3:05:02] struggling with and you put their need
[3:05:05] and you put more effort into praying and
[3:05:08] ministering to them than you do your own
[3:05:11] need now that has to come with
[3:05:12] limitation
[3:05:14] because we've got to take care of
[3:05:16] ourselves mentally emotionally and
[3:05:19] spiritually but if it's easier for you
[3:05:21] to relate to someone else's
[3:05:24] situation it's a sign that your love for
[3:05:28] them and as a Christian as a Believer is
[3:05:32] maturing and you're putting others ahead
[3:05:35] the by Jesus said by this shall all men
[3:05:38] know that you're my disciples not that
[3:05:41] you go to church with me but but that
[3:05:43] you're my disciples because of your love
[3:05:46] because you have love one for another
[3:05:49] and I don't even like talking about love
[3:05:51] sometime because people's idea and
[3:05:54] definition of love is so
[3:05:57] sappy until they don't even know what it
[3:05:59] really means to to love or to be loved
[3:06:02] but we're talking about putting
[3:06:06] yourself intercession in truest form is
[3:06:10] is putting yourself in someone else's
[3:06:13] environment in someone else's situation
[3:06:16] and standing there on their behalf
[3:06:18] before God Lord have mercy on my brother
[3:06:22] have mercy on my sister it's not you
[3:06:25] judging their
[3:06:26] life but it's you going Before the
[3:06:28] Throne on their behalf because sometimes
[3:06:31] they're too weak or they're too affected
[3:06:33] by apathy or too affected by
[3:06:36] addiction to go for
[3:06:39] themselves now in the night I visited
[3:06:42] this service
[3:06:44] and saw those two predominant Spirits
[3:06:46] trying to raise their head to distract
[3:06:49] the body now we worshiped through that
[3:06:53] even though you could feel that worship
[3:06:55] was a little bit in the body at least it
[3:06:57] was a little
[3:06:59] disjointed but we pushed in that's what
[3:07:01] we're trained to do that's what we're
[3:07:04] created to do is to push in even in that
[3:07:07] moment of being disjointed one from
[3:07:10] another and in the preaching we did
[3:07:13] pretty good in pulling so that we could
[3:07:16] push through some of that but now we
[3:07:17] have an opportunity to deal with that
[3:07:19] and we just say no we say no to
[3:07:22] addictive
[3:07:25] Tendencies come on you pray with me we
[3:07:28] say no to the spirit of
[3:07:32] addiction that wants to take hold of my
[3:07:35] life simply to distract
[3:07:38] me that Spirit can't change who you are
[3:07:42] in Christ
[3:07:44] but he wants to impede your
[3:07:47] journey and and what he wants to do is
[3:07:50] drown you in
[3:07:53] condemnation and so we say no to the
[3:07:56] spirit of addiction and to the spirit of
[3:07:59] addictive behavior in the name of Jesus
[3:08:03] Christ to those who have stepped forward
[3:08:06] to acknowledge the influence of that
[3:08:08] spirit in their life to those who are
[3:08:10] streaming this service to those who will
[3:08:13] watch it in archive in the authority of
[3:08:16] Jesus Christ we say no to that
[3:08:21] Spirit Take Your Filthy Hands Off the
[3:08:25] children of the most high God the
[3:08:29] overcoming powerful Victorious bride of
[3:08:32] Christ should not be should not be
[3:08:35] arrested or Paralyzed by addictive
[3:08:39] behaviors in the name of Jesus
[3:08:44] may God release grace to you right now
[3:08:48] to step out of that
[3:08:51] cycle that some of you have been in most
[3:08:53] of your life and when you break free
[3:08:57] from one addictive
[3:09:00] behavior you find yourself in
[3:09:03] another so what you're doing is
[3:09:06] replacing an addiction with an
[3:09:11] addiction
[3:09:15] in the name of Jesus Christ if you feel
[3:09:17] any of that for yourself raise up both
[3:09:19] of your
[3:09:22] hands it's more than don't dare miss
[3:09:25] this it's more than alcohol it's more
[3:09:27] than pot it's more than drugs it's more
[3:09:31] than sexual behaviors it's that are not
[3:09:34] holy and healthy for you it's more than
[3:09:36] it's anything it's
[3:09:39] eating it's
[3:09:41] eating it's doing it's it's red
[3:09:45] bulls it's anything that you do that you
[3:09:48] become so caught up in that it begins to
[3:09:51] affect your health physically or
[3:09:54] spiritually father in the name of Jesus
[3:09:57] Christ we receive right now it doesn't
[3:10:00] have to be by the casting out of a
[3:10:02] spirit because we're defeating that
[3:10:04] spirit with the with the name of Jesus
[3:10:06] by the authority of the word and by the
[3:10:09] power of the blood we say we call an in
[3:10:14] we declare and decree an end and we lay
[3:10:18] a spiritual ax at the root of that
[3:10:23] spirit and by faith we separate you as
[3:10:28] children of the most high God from The
[3:10:30] Addictive Behavior from the spirit of
[3:10:32] addiction that has held you
[3:10:41] ish May if your hands are up and you've
[3:10:45] identified yourself with some of that I
[3:10:47] want those around you even even with the
[3:10:50] same problem to put one hand over on
[3:10:52] your shoulder for just a moment because
[3:10:54] there's strength in this there's an
[3:10:56] element of
[3:10:57] embarrassment there's an element of
[3:10:59] embarrassment and there's an element of
[3:11:01] shame that goes with these things but we
[3:11:03] just say no to shame and we say no to
[3:11:07] condemnation and we say no to
[3:11:10] embarrassment right now we don't care we
[3:11:12] don't care if our flesh gets embarrassed
[3:11:15] we don't care today we choose not to be
[3:11:18] concerned about about our our reputation
[3:11:22] we choose not to be
[3:11:25] concerned a and more so we are concerned
[3:11:29] about our freedom in
[3:11:31] Christ we don't want to move around one
[3:11:34] Sunday with Liberty only to find that
[3:11:36] the week ahead is full of
[3:11:38] addiction full of addictive
[3:11:41] behavior
[3:11:44] it's
[3:11:45] [Music]
[3:11:50] toxic it's toxic it poisons
[3:11:53] relationships in the name of Jesus
[3:11:56] Christ there's Authority in this house
[3:11:58] there's Authority in this house I'm not
[3:12:00] expecting you to feel it but there is
[3:12:02] Authority in this house right now over
[3:12:04] your head take your Victory take your
[3:12:07] Liberty but I've tried it and I've tried
[3:12:09] this and I've tried that try it this way
[3:12:13] try it this way today Lord Jesus help me
[3:12:16] Lord Jesus here I am I want to be out
[3:12:19] from under the influence of the things
[3:12:21] that Satan sends to my detriment and to
[3:12:23] my destruction out of
[3:12:35] it spirit of God Holy Ghost intercede
[3:12:38] for us holy ghost intercede for us until
[3:12:41] we break free Holy
[3:12:44] Ghost come and do in us what we can't do
[3:12:47] for ourselves come and do through us and
[3:12:50] in us what we cannot do for ourselves
[3:12:54] did you know you can be addicted to
[3:12:56] feeling sorry for
[3:12:58] [Music]
[3:12:59] yourself let that be broken let that be
[3:13:03] broken let that be broken you can become
[3:13:06] addicted to looking at everybody else's
[3:13:09] life and comparing it to yours let that
[3:13:11] be broken
[3:13:13] the devil's so stupid sometime he's so
[3:13:16] foolish sometime he'll make you think
[3:13:18] that what you see on other people's
[3:13:20] Facebook is how they really
[3:13:22] live and make you jealous of something
[3:13:25] that doesn't even really exist it's a
[3:13:28] facade it's a ruse that the enemy tries
[3:13:32] to put out there and you struggle you
[3:13:34] struggle you struggle with that break
[3:13:37] break that now break that break that in
[3:13:39] the authority of Jesus Christ break that
[3:13:42] right now now break
[3:13:46] that now Lord we pray for those who step
[3:13:49] forward because they deal with a with a
[3:13:52] with a spirit of apathy with a with a
[3:13:55] lingering sense of not caring
[3:13:59] enough a lack of
[3:14:02] enthusiasm a lack of
[3:14:06] concern and so Lord right now as only
[3:14:10] you
[3:14:11] can we call you to light a fire in our
[3:14:19] lives we're tired of a lack of interest
[3:14:22] in the things of God we're tired of a
[3:14:24] lack of interest in the word of God
[3:14:26] we're tired of replacing the word with
[3:14:29] all kinds of other things we must learn
[3:14:32] to live in
[3:14:34] Balance there's time for other things
[3:14:37] besides the word but we want to live in
[3:14:40] balance in wholeness Inc completeness in
[3:14:43] our life and somebody may have to do
[3:14:47] without
[3:14:48] something so that you can have your time
[3:14:50] with the
[3:14:52] word in the name of Jesus now Lord those
[3:14:56] that are standing here with that thing
[3:14:58] that has prevailed in their life from
[3:15:00] time to time apathy we break that off
[3:15:03] the see the truth just telling the truth
[3:15:06] just speaking it out can do so much just
[3:15:09] by telling you what happened in the
[3:15:11] spirit already can really bring your
[3:15:13] faith level up if you'll let it devil
[3:15:16] already trying to talk to some of you
[3:15:18] but tell him you've been listening to
[3:15:19] him long enough you're tired of what he
[3:15:21] has to say he's a liar and the father of
[3:15:24] all lies today I choose to hear the word
[3:15:27] of God speaking in my life and over my
[3:15:30] life and to my
[3:15:32] [Music]
[3:15:36] life some of you keep making terrible
[3:15:40] mistakes with your decisions
[3:15:43] because you have not surrendered to
[3:15:46] obedience you have not surrendered to
[3:15:48] obey the Lord and so you keep making
[3:15:52] self-sabotaging
[3:15:53] decisions and self-destructive
[3:15:57] decisions because you haven't obeyed the
[3:15:59] Lord may God breathe over you strength
[3:16:01] right now to to to obey his
[3:16:05] voice to do what he has called you to
[3:16:08] do you may not be worthy of the calling
[3:16:11] who is but he loved you and he called
[3:16:14] you and he doesn't call us without
[3:16:16] giving us what we need and equipping us
[3:16:19] to do his will break
[3:16:23] off in the name of
[3:16:26] Jesus all
[3:16:28] apathy all
[3:16:30] apathy all
[3:16:32] addiction May the grace of God come to
[3:16:36] make better choices and better decisions
[3:16:39] in our life get ready Benjamin in the
[3:16:41] name of Jesus in the name of Jesus in
[3:16:45] the name of Jesus now I want you to
[3:16:47] praise the Lord with me I want you to
[3:16:49] Worship the Lord with me for just a
[3:16:51] moment a a as we recognize that God
[3:16:55] loved us so much that he wanted to deal
[3:16:58] with that part if you're standing here
[3:17:01] in condemnation that's not of God tell
[3:17:03] the devil to go if the enemy's trying to
[3:17:06] embarrass you that's not of God tell the
[3:17:08] enemy no I'm not giving in to that if
[3:17:11] he's trying to shame you tell him right
[3:17:13] now I'm not going to walk out of here in
[3:17:15] shame I'm just struggling on the journey
[3:17:17] to the throne I'm making my way to the
[3:17:20] throne I'm making my way to the holy of
[3:17:23] holies and these are these are are like
[3:17:26] parasites that get a hold of our life to
[3:17:28] suck out the life but I'm just a pilgrim
[3:17:30] on a journey to the throne and God will
[3:17:33] save me from Despair and God will save
[3:17:36] me from addiction and he will save me
[3:17:38] from apathy and whatever else the enemy
[3:17:41] would would throw my way yes Lord next
[3:17:45] week we'll talk to you about the
[3:17:46] stronghold of cold love as we present
[3:17:49] the message that the Lord has given us
[3:17:52] so if the enemy comes to try to turn
[3:17:55] your love cold Your Love toward him your
[3:17:57] love toward others you can break free
[3:18:00] from
[3:18:01] that right in the Song of Solomon it
[3:18:04] says it talks about setting a seal on
[3:18:07] the
[3:18:08] arm and this is this is a a metaphor
[3:18:12] [Music]
[3:18:13] of a Perpetual love for the
[3:18:17] bridegroom as we are reminded that he
[3:18:19] perpetually loves us and he loves us
[3:18:23] just as we are but he loves us too much
[3:18:25] to leave us that way he wants to
[3:18:27] constantly make changes and differences
[3:18:30] aren't we blessed aren't we blessed to
[3:18:32] serve a god like that aren't we blessed
[3:18:35] to have a lover like that let's worship
