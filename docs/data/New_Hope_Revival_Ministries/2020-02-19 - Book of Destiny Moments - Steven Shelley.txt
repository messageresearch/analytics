TRANSCRIPT
========================================
how many of you'd like to run your finger down God's plan of destiny there's no romanticizing about what age you wish you could live then you were chosen handpicked Oh God saw you in out up and down strengths and weaknesses and everything else he saw it all and hand-picked you for such an hour as this because we know and have said hundreds of times a body was created for you through through the miracle of a of an act of consummation you had a physical assistance provided for you but it was only God and it remains only God who chooses what the Spirit will go into that little body only God and His sovereignty could design could choose what spirit would go into what body what family in what age let me tell you something a little newsflash here God never makes mistakes I'm suggesting that you step over into another realm there's a realm of walking in the flesh there's a realm of walking in the spirit I'm suggesting that we begin to walk in the spirit and that instead of trying to walk through where we have been or where we think we're going it'd be a great idea to find the path of life that God had chosen for us and shaped for us and recorded about us it would be good to catch up with God's plan for for what is the date today February 16th 2020 how many of you'd like to run your finger down God's plan of destiny or scroll of destiny or book of days or whatever you'd like want to call it how many of you'd like to scroll your finger find that spot x marks the spot February the 16th 2020 find any variation in who you are and what God said you were to be and get that under the blood and step up into what he has for you somebody said I don't even know what it is it's there it's in the book it was first a thought but now it's written down and I thought about those demon spirits that want to swindle you and swindle me out of a page in my Destiny's book I don't want to live another moment in the permissive will of God when there's a book somewhere with the perfect will of God for my life written in that book and it was sealed up I believe it I believe those truths and even the days of your life were sealed up underneath that book of redemption and whether you realize it or not it's not sealed up anymore you have an opportunity by revelation to see the plan of redemption to see your name in the book come on to see what how you fit and to get up and do it I love the fact that God not only had a thought but he wrote it down and he is forever accountable to what his first thoughts were about you he cannot forget what he thought about you in the beginning even if he could he can't even if he won't he can't because it is written down in the book
