[0:02] [Music]
[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right Christ in
[0:43] you the hope a lord
[1:00] hello and welcome to the program again
[1:03] today I'm pastor Stephen Shelley of New
[1:07] Hope revival ministries and I'm coming
[1:09] to you again today in partnership with
[1:12] our great friends at the gospel channel
[1:15] and we are thankful to God I don't take
[1:18] this opportunity for granted I'm
[1:19] thankful to the Lord every day for
[1:22] giving me the chance to be able to speak
[1:25] to you the precious Word of God it's
[1:28] life to us you know there are things in
[1:31] the Word of God that are corrective but
[1:34] I've been told that love is corrective
[1:37] and I know that God loves me I want you
[1:40] to know today that God loves you and his
[1:44] word is his answer to every situation in
[1:49] your life there are times that we read
[1:52] the Word of God and it encourages us it
[1:54] blesses us it strengthens us to move
[1:57] forward in him and there are times that
[2:00] we read it and we see by God's Word that
[2:03] we're not quite measuring up to what the
[2:06] scripture is asking of us and instead of
[2:10] being condemned we take that as
[2:13] conviction and we can repent and we can
[2:17] say lord help me to align myself with
[2:21] your precious word so when you're
[2:24] reading the scripture understand that it
[2:26] is the plan of God's salvation and
[2:30] redemption for all mankind it's a love
[2:33] letter from the heart of God to you and
[2:37] make it personal you know I've often
[2:40] heard preachers say put your name in
[2:43] there you know when you're reading the
[2:45] scripture for God so loved the world
[2:47] don't be ashamed to read it for God so
[2:50] loved Stephen Shelley that he gave
[2:53] himself I think it's important to make
[2:56] the Word of God personal to see
[2:59] ourselves as a part of God's economy I
[3:02] want to say also that I believe in the
[3:05] power of prayer it's not prayer in
[3:08] itself
[3:09] but prayer is a means that God has given
[3:12] us of coming into fellowship with him to
[3:17] bare our heart before him to agree with
[3:20] what his word has spoken about
[3:23] particular situations to cast our cares
[3:27] to lay our burdens at his feet and I am
[3:31] often overwhelmed with a great sense of
[3:34] peace and assurance when I'm finished
[3:36] praying knowing that my Heavenly Father
[3:39] hears and that he answers and that he is
[3:43] a rewarder of those who diligently seek
[3:46] Him and I think I did this a couple of
[3:49] programs back but I wanted to do it
[3:52] again today
[3:53] I wanted to show you across the world
[3:56] where you're watching this program I
[3:59] wanted to show you this stack of prayer
[4:01] requests and I wanted you to know that
[4:04] these are the emails and the phone calls
[4:07] that have been recorded of you reaching
[4:10] out to us sharing your heart sometimes
[4:14] very personal details and it it blesses
[4:19] me to know that you have seen something
[4:22] or heard something in this program that
[4:26] would cause you to have enough
[4:28] confidence in us that you would call or
[4:31] write and share what's going on in your
[4:34] life right now and I want you to know
[4:36] that all of us at New Hope revival
[4:40] ministries take this seriously
[4:42] in fact this stack of prayer requests is
[4:45] rarely very far from where I am it's
[4:49] usually where I am I often take it home
[4:53] with me when I leave the office so that
[4:55] when I pray in the evening or in the
[4:57] morning before I come in
[4:59] I have it I don't think that's necessary
[5:02] but I like laying my hands on it as a
[5:05] point of agreement and contact and I
[5:08] like looking through it again and again
[5:11] and again and reading your names which I
[5:14] wouldn't read on the air without your
[5:17] permission but I enjoy reading your name
[5:20] here
[5:21] a precious sister has called from London
[5:24] asking for prayer for her daughter's
[5:27] kidneys she's in the hospital and things
[5:31] have not been going well and we've been
[5:34] praying over that request since it came
[5:36] in lately we've had a lot of requests
[5:40] from people who have have experienced
[5:43] some of the spiritual attacks that we
[5:47] have been talking about and you have
[5:49] been able to identify with some of the
[5:51] teaching that has gone forth and you
[5:54] have written us to pray and we have been
[5:57] praying here is someone who has just
[6:00] experienced a whole battery of medical
[6:03] tests and they're asking the Lord for
[6:06] healing and for good results from those
[6:09] tests here is someone who feels like
[6:12] their family has been dealing with
[6:15] witchcraft that's been spoken against
[6:19] them and they desire to have freedom and
[6:21] to live in peace and love and harmony
[6:25] that's what the request says and these
[6:28] are just a small representation of the
[6:31] needs that are out there these are the
[6:33] ones who have taken the time to reach
[6:37] out and to let us know that you would
[6:39] appreciate our faith being joined with
[6:42] yours I want to start our time together
[6:45] today with a word of Prayer and even if
[6:50] your requests are not in this stack I
[6:52] want you to know that when we pray over
[6:55] these needs we're praying over your
[6:57] needs as well we believe that that God
[7:01] is able to reach right down into your
[7:04] home into your place of business into
[7:08] into your wherever you are wherever
[7:11] you're watching this program and I say
[7:13] it that way because we're not only
[7:16] airing this on the television but it
[7:19] will air on YouTube and it will air on
[7:22] the gospel channel website where you can
[7:25] access the website all over the world
[7:28] and watch the programs on the three
[7:31] networks that are represent
[7:33] they're the one that reaches into
[7:34] Scandinavia the one that reaches across
[7:36] the beautiful island of Iceland and the
[7:39] one that reaches across Europe all three
[7:42] of those feeds you can can see them
[7:45] right there on the gospel channel on
[7:47] their website and so I don't know where
[7:50] you're going to see this but I want you
[7:52] to know that when we pray together in a
[7:54] moment you put your need before the Lord
[7:57] and you join your faith with our faith
[8:00] and let's see some miracles take place
[8:02] the Bible tells us that if we will agree
[8:05] together as touching any one thing that
[8:10] it would be given to us and I'm not just
[8:13] saying that because I have something to
[8:16] sell I don't have anything to sell I'm
[8:18] saying that because I've lived it and I
[8:21] believe it with every fiber of who I am
[8:25] I've watched the Lord answer prayer I've
[8:28] stood in the hospital room where the
[8:30] doctor said there is no hope
[8:33] not even prayer I've had doctors say to
[8:36] families in my presence not even prayer
[8:40] would be able to help us now well I want
[8:42] you to know I've seen the Lord step into
[8:46] the room I've seen the Lord reverse what
[8:49] the doctor said could not be reversed
[8:52] I've actually seen those who were told
[8:55] they would never walk again
[8:57] with my own eyes I've watched them walk
[9:00] again those who were told they would
[9:02] never speak again and I was in the room
[9:05] when they spoke their first words after
[9:07] many years because of an accident that
[9:10] took away their ability to speak let me
[9:13] tell you something with with faith in
[9:15] God all things are possible and I truly
[9:21] believe that and we usually go off the
[9:24] air with a prayer but today I want you
[9:27] to agree with me in prayer right now
[9:29] that God will move on your behalf
[9:32] whatever your need is let's pray
[9:35] together Heavenly Father we thank you
[9:37] today for this wonderful privilege that
[9:41] you have given to us I stand
[9:44] amazed that the God of all eternity
[9:49] would bow his ear to our humble prayer
[9:53] it blesses me to know Lord with all that
[9:58] goes on in the universe that you give an
[10:02] attentive ear to the cries of the
[10:05] righteous to the calls of your people
[10:09] and today O God we lift up every need
[10:13] that is represented in this stack of
[10:15] prayer requests and with them Lord we
[10:18] add every need that is represented by
[10:21] every viewer of this program across the
[10:26] board all of the different means by
[10:28] which someone could see this program it
[10:31] even sometimes appears on Facebook lord
[10:36] I ask that every one of those needs that
[10:40] are hidden in the hearts of the viewer
[10:42] right now that you would consider them
[10:45] Oh God as we lift up our faith to you
[10:48] knowing that you are faithful you are
[10:51] the healer many sicknesses many
[10:54] infirmities but you are the healer of
[10:57] them all you are Jehovah Rapha the Lord
[11:01] our God who healeth all of our diseases
[11:04] Lord some are under demonic attack I
[11:08] know there are some who might watch the
[11:10] program who who mock at the very idea
[11:13] but many of us as believers understand
[11:17] the battle that rages in the realm of
[11:20] the Spirit but Lord we look to you right
[11:22] now and we break curses of witchcraft
[11:25] and we break satanic strongholds and we
[11:29] asked Lord for grace to close demonic
[11:32] doorways that these precious ones could
[11:35] be set free from the attack of the enemy
[11:38] we pray as we have prayed before that
[11:41] you would help each believer to identify
[11:44] any area in their life where they should
[11:48] close the door maybe a door has somehow
[11:52] been opened up that has
[11:54] the enemy some permission to move
[11:57] against them lord I ask that you would
[12:01] pinpoint that even now and show them the
[12:04] way of escape you said Lord with every
[12:07] temptation you would give us a way of
[12:10] escape Lord I pray for the backslider
[12:13] who might be watching this program or
[12:16] who has a loved one who is watching the
[12:20] program and calling out to you for their
[12:23] salvation for their fellowship with you
[12:26] to be renewed I pray right now that you
[12:28] would draw them back to the fold that
[12:31] you would work in their lives according
[12:34] to your plan oh god whatever the needs
[12:37] are some marriages are rocky and
[12:40] relationships have been severed Oh God
[12:44] wedges have been driven down between
[12:46] longtime friends and neighbors who have
[12:50] once worked together and moved together
[12:53] and now the enemy has come to destroy
[12:56] that relationship but in the name of the
[12:59] Lord Jesus Christ we look to you today O
[13:02] God to move to saved a heal to deliver
[13:07] to set free because that's who you are
[13:10] old precious Lord we pray for the gospel
[13:13] channel we pray for brother Eric
[13:15] Erickson and the staff that you would
[13:18] bless them and strengthen them we pray
[13:21] for every need that they have
[13:23] we pray for financial breakthrough for
[13:26] the network that it would be able to
[13:28] continue to go forward and spread the
[13:31] good gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[13:34] pray right now that you'd bless our time
[13:36] together in your word today and that you
[13:39] would search our hearts and if there be
[13:42] any place in us that is rebellious
[13:44] against your word or against your will
[13:47] and plan for our lives would you show it
[13:51] to us today Lord and give us grace to
[13:53] turn from rebellion and to walk in total
[13:58] submission to truth that's who you are
[14:01] and truth makes us free we pray all of
[14:06] these things and for
[14:08] every need represented by those viewing
[14:11] this program right now in the precious
[14:14] name of our Lord Jesus Christ and Yeshua
[14:17] our Messiah that's who you are Lord and
[14:21] we thank you amen and amen
[14:24] I believe God I believe God if you'd
[14:28] like to add your prayer requests to this
[14:30] stack please feel free to do so this is
[14:35] program 11 in a series that we have
[14:40] entitled schemes and devices and in one
[14:44] way we're winding down in this portion
[14:47] of the study and yet there is a very
[14:51] similar direction that I I'm praying
[14:54] about and strongly considering moving
[14:57] into where we would be a little more
[14:59] specific than what we've been in this
[15:01] particular series and really look at
[15:05] some of the ways our lives can be opened
[15:07] up to that dark side of the spirit world
[15:11] I I believe that there are boundaries
[15:14] that that surround the life of the
[15:18] believer and I believe that when we let
[15:21] down when we move those boundaries when
[15:24] we let down the walls and we are
[15:27] careless with some of our decisions we
[15:29] really open up our life and we make
[15:33] ourselves very vulnerable to the attacks
[15:37] of the enemy
[15:38] I believe there's power in the blood of
[15:41] Jesus Christ there's power in the name
[15:44] there's power in the Word of God we were
[15:49] talking together in a program a few back
[15:53] in the series again about the whole
[15:56] armor of God God's armor that he has
[16:01] given us to protect us to give us what
[16:06] we need to not only stand against the
[16:08] wiles of the enemy but to fight for our
[16:11] lives and sometimes it seems that that's
[16:15] what the battle is about fighting for
[16:17] the victory you know one of the things
[16:20] that I
[16:21] like the enemy uses against God's people
[16:24] until it makes me angry I hope you don't
[16:28] lose confidence in me for saying so but
[16:30] I get mad when I see how the enemy uses
[16:34] depression and anxiety and emotional
[16:38] heaviness against the people of God it
[16:41] really makes me fighting mad and I know
[16:46] that if you and I could recognize that
[16:49] it is the enemy and if we could
[16:52] recognize that we have already been
[16:54] given power over the enemy in that area
[16:57] over the last couple of days I've been
[17:01] following a news story in our country of
[17:04] a young pastor who took his own life
[17:07] maybe you've seen that across social
[17:10] media and it has caused me to weep
[17:13] because I I don't have one word of
[17:17] criticism I don't have one word of
[17:19] judgment it is not up to me whether
[17:22] another man serve it stands or Falls
[17:25] it's not my place to judge anyone's
[17:29] eternal home where where they live for
[17:33] eternity that is between them and God
[17:35] but I can tell you as a pastor I
[17:39] completely understand how the enemy
[17:42] targets the people of God and how he
[17:46] specifically targets those of us who
[17:49] have surrendered our lives to ministry
[17:52] and to live instead of for ourselves to
[17:56] live for others and it's broken my heart
[17:59] to think about small children who will
[18:02] grow up without a father and a precious
[18:05] young wife without her husband and a
[18:09] precious Church a vibrant church I
[18:12] understand who will certainly be shaken
[18:16] to the core how can these things happen
[18:20] but I want you to know the enemy is sly
[18:23] and he will use every trick and every
[18:27] temptation that he can possibly utilize
[18:31] to try to take God's people out
[18:35] because he sees those of us who are
[18:38] walking in the spirit as threats it's as
[18:43] though many of us have a an x mark on
[18:45] our back and we're targeted by the enemy
[18:49] this is not something that should
[18:52] provoke fear in us but it should
[18:55] certainly provoke awareness I also want
[18:59] you to know that mental disease is real
[19:02] it's it's not something that is made-up
[19:07] mental sickness or mental disease it's a
[19:12] very serious problem in the United
[19:15] States of America and around the world
[19:17] and when someone is in ministry it's
[19:21] it's so humiliating it seems so
[19:24] embarrassing it seems actually it is for
[19:27] anyone who fights in that area who
[19:30] battles with that kind of a sickness but
[19:33] you can imagine a pastor or a church
[19:36] leader and I wonder sometim who can they
[19:40] reach out to even as a pastor who can I
[19:43] reach out to if I'm battling in such a
[19:46] manner as that I want you to know that
[19:48] we all need those connections we all
[19:52] need accountability partners we all need
[19:55] peers there's no doubt about it we need
[19:59] friends we need human contact we need to
[20:01] be able to support one another but I
[20:04] want you to know there are limits to
[20:06] what we can do for one another unless
[20:09] you've walked in that kind of a
[20:11] situation where you've experienced panic
[20:14] attacks and anxiety and depression and
[20:16] all that goes with it
[20:17] suicidal tendencies and thoughts unless
[20:21] you've walked in that kind of a place
[20:22] it's very hard for us to understand
[20:25] exactly what someone is going through
[20:27] and so when we say to them I know what
[20:30] you're going through it's very hard for
[20:32] them to accept that we know but here's
[20:35] what I want to say to you at the end of
[20:37] this of this little speech I want to
[20:40] tell you that Jesus is a friend that
[20:44] sticketh closer than a brother and
[20:46] although we need all
[20:48] these friends and we need a support
[20:50] system and we need to be able to cry out
[20:52] for help even ministers even worship
[20:55] leaders watching this program right now
[20:57] you need to be able to cry out for help
[21:00] you need to be able to be transparent
[21:03] find someone that you can say I'm
[21:06] struggling and I need prayer but at the
[21:09] end of the day I want you to know there
[21:11] there are limits to what people who love
[21:15] us can do for us
[21:17] but hear me well there is no limit there
[21:22] is no limit to what God can do for us
[21:26] when we lean on him when we totally
[21:29] throw ourselves at his mercy and we say
[21:33] oh god it's no longer up to me whether I
[21:36] sink or swim it's up to you I've gone as
[21:41] far as I possibly can go in my own
[21:45] strength and I'm going to seemingly lay
[21:48] here and die if you don't raise me up
[21:50] but I am depending and trusting you you
[21:53] have promised me in your word and you
[21:57] know maybe some of you hear this and you
[21:59] you think I must really be a naive
[22:02] person but I'm basing what I tell you on
[22:06] experience not just my own experience
[22:09] but the experience of so many others
[22:12] that I have walked with through the
[22:14] years there's just nobody like Jesus to
[22:20] know him to be able to talk to him you
[22:23] know what this is a strange statement to
[22:26] make but I have shared some things with
[22:29] the Lord that I wouldn't want to share
[22:31] with another I love my wife I can talk
[22:34] to my wife I hope she can talk to me but
[22:38] there are feelings that I've had
[22:39] thoughts that have come through my mind
[22:41] hurts and anger and and and roots of
[22:45] bitterness that creep up that I wouldn't
[22:46] have wanted to tell a single solitary
[22:48] soul embarrassed humiliated to admit to
[22:53] someone that after all these years I
[22:55] would have a thought like that or I
[22:57] would struggle through a situation like
[22:59] that but I
[23:00] have found out you can tell Jesus you
[23:03] can share with him whatever you're going
[23:05] through and however you feel and I don't
[23:08] think I've ever shocked him I may have
[23:11] disappointed him but his love for me has
[23:16] been so real that when I finished I
[23:19] don't know if this is proper to say in
[23:22] every place where this program will air
[23:25] but sometimes we make this expression
[23:29] spill my guts maybe that's way too too
[23:32] graphic to say it just means you know
[23:35] you just pour out everything to the Lord
[23:37] you just tell him everything every
[23:40] hidden thing every everything you'd be
[23:42] embarrassed to tell anybody else and
[23:44] this piece I don't ever remember getting
[23:47] up from one of those confession sessions
[23:49] where I felt like the Lord was angry
[23:52] with me I don't ever remember feeling
[23:54] like you're he's angry with me or he'll
[23:57] never use me again or he's gonna kick me
[24:00] out because I've been honest with him
[24:02] let me tell you something children of
[24:04] God we live below our means even I
[24:08] struggle at times I know to understand
[24:12] the depth of God's love for me he loves
[24:17] me he loves you he is for you
[24:22] he is not against you he may not like
[24:27] everything that we say or do we may not
[24:30] always please him or live according to
[24:35] his word
[24:36] but if our heart is toward him and we
[24:41] are actively seeking to surrender to his
[24:45] authority in our lives I'll tell you
[24:48] he'll go the farthest mile he'll walk in
[24:52] places where you would think God would
[24:54] never walk he'll reach out to you in
[24:57] situations that you would think he would
[24:59] never reach out to you in that's his
[25:02] love for you I don't know who I'm
[25:04] talking to right now but I'm telling you
[25:07] no matter how bad your circumstances are
[25:10] life with geez
[25:11] it's worth the living I can't tell you
[25:15] that your life as it is right now is
[25:18] worth the living I don't know you and I
[25:21] don't know the circumstances of your
[25:23] life but I'll tell you this life with
[25:26] Jesus I don't care how bad life is if
[25:30] you live it now with Jesus it'll change
[25:34] everything for you it'll give you the
[25:37] grace to to pick yourself up to look up
[25:40] to push push a little harder to press in
[25:44] a little more fervently and believe that
[25:46] with God all things are possible things
[25:49] can change when we surrender our lives
[25:52] to him so let him come invite him and
[25:57] then make room for him to come and
[26:00] occupy your your heart and to occupy
[26:04] your life if you are struggling with
[26:07] depression if you're struggling with
[26:09] anxiety if you're struggling with
[26:11] thoughts of suicide open your heart
[26:14] right now let the love of God come in
[26:17] let the truth of God's Word penetrate
[26:20] the darkness and let me tell you again
[26:23] life with Jesus is worth the living no
[26:27] matter what the circumstances are right
[26:29] now I don't believe there's a
[26:31] circumstance that God can't make a
[26:33] difference in if we open up and we allow
[26:37] him to come in and to move in every area
[26:41] of our lives
[26:42] find someone find a church somewhere
[26:46] find something to be connected to where
[26:50] someone can support you and help you but
[26:54] if that's not available to you
[26:56] understand that God wants to meet with
[26:58] you and your flat he wants to meet with
[27:01] you in your home right where you are his
[27:04] spirit can be just as real and just as
[27:07] tangible as a friend coming over and
[27:11] sitting and having a cup of tea with you
[27:13] his presence can be that satisfying his
[27:17] love can be that comforting if you just
[27:21] open your heart to him and I know we
[27:23] pray but I'm going to
[27:24] pray again father in the name of Jesus
[27:27] Christ whoever I'm speaking to right now
[27:30] I pray Lord that if as they open their
[27:33] heart to you
[27:34] you would allow your love to become as
[27:37] tangible as I have described it to be
[27:39] let your presence surround them right
[27:42] now or father and confirm to their heart
[27:46] that life with you is worth the living
[27:49] and lord I ask you to give them grace to
[27:53] surrender every area of their life that
[27:56] looks so dark and so broken and so
[27:59] hopeless and I'm asking you to come and
[28:01] get glory in the darkness in the
[28:04] hardship in the in the dire circumstance
[28:07] come Oh God and receive glory for your
[28:11] name by manifesting and breaking out and
[28:14] breaking forth in every area of that
[28:17] life we ask it in the name of the Lord
[28:20] Jesus Christ amen and amen I believe the
[28:24] Lord is speaking to someone and I
[28:27] believe that he's there he's as close as
[28:30] you and I will allow him to be when we
[28:33] studied the Word of God together last
[28:36] time we were we were mentioning a time
[28:40] when God gave very specific instructions
[28:43] on how a particular thing was to be
[28:47] handled Saul went into this situation
[28:51] knowing that God had said every one of
[28:56] the Amalekites must be destroyed he knew
[29:00] exactly what God was requiring of him in
[29:04] his day and understand that things were
[29:07] different
[29:08] in the day of King Saul than they are
[29:11] now and King Saul was being used of God
[29:17] to not only secure safety for the people
[29:23] of God in that generation but in other
[29:26] generations to come and because Saul was
[29:31] not completely surrendered to this
[29:34] instruction but he thought that his idea
[29:38] was a little bit better than God's idea
[29:39] he thought his plan was a little bit
[29:43] superior to God's plan and so he obeyed
[29:47] in almost all of the details but there
[29:51] were some details that that he just
[29:53] wasn't obedient in he kept certain of
[29:56] the animals and even more dangerously he
[30:00] allowed King Agag the king of the
[30:02] Amalekites to live and what what
[30:05] happened because of that was it would
[30:08] have been a seed that would have
[30:10] continued on that would have always
[30:13] brought threat against the people of God
[30:16] and God wanted this to be a threat that
[30:19] was completely wiped out and so he sent
[30:23] the prophet Samuel to meet Saul coming
[30:26] back from the slaughter and to speak to
[30:30] him about what had happened and you know
[30:33] Saul knew in his heart that he had not
[30:37] fully obeyed the Lord just like nearly
[30:39] every person watching this program right
[30:42] now you know in your heart the areas of
[30:45] your life where you have been fully
[30:48] surrendered to God and you also know
[30:51] right now those those little places in
[30:54] your life that you have held on to and
[30:56] that you have not allowed the Word of
[30:59] God and the Spirit of God the love of
[31:02] God to penetrate those areas where you
[31:06] have not been obedient Saul knew and
[31:09] instead of just opening up and facing
[31:14] the consequences saying to the prophet
[31:17] Samuel I'm guilty what's going to happen
[31:20] to me now he got very religious and he
[31:25] said all yes I have spared some of the
[31:28] animals because we wanted to sacrifice
[31:30] them to God you know God wasn't looking
[31:34] for a sacrifice he was looking for
[31:37] submission and for obedience and the
[31:42] Bible tells us obedience is better than
[31:46] sacrifice to obey God
[31:51] what he's looking for in our lives is it
[31:55] always easy preacher to obey God no I
[31:58] try to be honest and transparent with
[32:01] you
[32:02] there are times that God asked of us
[32:05] things that they don't feel so easy to
[32:09] do but the older I get the more I learn
[32:13] and the more I've experienced I now have
[32:16] more years to look back on in those
[32:19] moments when it seemed that God was
[32:22] asking requiring something of me that I
[32:26] just did not have the strength to do as
[32:30] I prayed about it as I yielded myself
[32:33] and just finally said Lord I can't do it
[32:36] on my own but if you think I can
[32:40] evidently Lord you think I can or you
[32:43] wouldn't have required it of me and so
[32:46] I'm asking you for grace now all grace
[32:50] come on now amazing grace God's grace
[32:56] empowers us strengthens us to do things
[33:02] for him that we would never think
[33:05] possible in the natural so in every area
[33:08] of your life like King Saul where you
[33:12] have not been completely submitted and
[33:16] obedient to God I ask you allow the
[33:21] grace of God to come in allow the
[33:24] strength of the Lord to come in if he
[33:26] wants it done
[33:27] he knows how to give you grace to yield
[33:29] your life to yield the gifts that he has
[33:32] placed in your life so that the work can
[33:35] be accomplished and so this this
[33:38] confrontation between the prophet Samuel
[33:42] and King Saul it came down to some
[33:46] serious moments and finally after Saul
[33:51] was confronted for failing to obey God's
[33:54] commandments completely he was then
[33:56] rebuked by the Prophet saying for
[33:59] rebellion this is first samuel 15 verse
[34:02] 23 for rebellion
[34:04] is as the sin of witchcraft and
[34:08] stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry
[34:13] you see God saw right through Saul's
[34:17] excuse this had nothing to do with soul
[34:23] desiring to bring more sacrifices this
[34:27] had everything to do with Saul's own
[34:30] pride he thought that he had a plan that
[34:34] was superior to God's plan i I've been
[34:38] guilty I've been guilty of the very same
[34:41] thing and maybe you have too if you
[34:43] followed the Lord for any period of time
[34:46] God leads us circumstances open up doors
[34:51] begin to open up God begins to reveal
[34:54] his plan for a particular situation and
[34:58] all of a sudden we get a bright idea a
[35:02] bright idea that turns out not to be so
[35:05] bright let me tell you something if it's
[35:09] not God's idea it's not often a bright
[35:11] idea what God inspires ideas that he
[35:16] breathes inspiration into that's a good
[35:18] idea
[35:19] and when God says you go and do a work
[35:22] do a job and do it thoroughly it's a
[35:25] good idea to obey and saw found that out
[35:30] he found out that this was not even
[35:33] though he offered a religious excuse as
[35:35] we often do he found out God saw right
[35:39] through it and this was not a matter of
[35:41] wanting to be more faithful and more
[35:43] religious and offer more sacrifices he
[35:46] found out that this was rebellion I
[35:50] wonder if it was a surprise to Saul to
[35:55] hear spoken aloud by the prophet Samuel
[35:59] that there was actually witchcraft
[36:02] rebellion in his life for rebellion is
[36:07] as the sin of witchcraft and
[36:09] stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry
[36:12] I believe we need to be steadfast but we
[36:17] don't need to be
[36:18] stubborn because stubbornness is as the
[36:21] sin of idolatry and rebellion is likened
[36:25] to witchcraft why would that be well
[36:31] it's interesting the rebellion is
[36:34] likened to witchcraft because witchcraft
[36:37] is about control and really rebellion is
[36:42] a power struggle it's really about who
[36:46] is going to be in control of my life of
[36:50] my decisions of my choices is it going
[36:53] to be me shouldn't I be don't I have my
[36:57] rights
[36:58] shouldn't I be in charge of my own life
[37:00] or will I surrender my will to God's
[37:08] will and to God's Way so in this story
[37:13] we learned that there's a spirit behind
[37:16] rebellion and it's not the Holy Spirit
[37:19] but it's rather witchcraft how can then
[37:23] a stubborn person be guilty of idolatry
[37:26] I think we mentioned the last time we
[37:29] were together he makes an idol of his
[37:31] own thoughts of his own opinions nobody
[37:35] has better thoughts better opinions
[37:38] better ideas than that man and when when
[37:44] he feels that way and lives that way
[37:46] operates that way he's leaving out the
[37:49] most important part of life God the one
[37:52] who has a better plan
[37:54] the one who has a more superior way and
[37:57] so his own opinions become like idols
[38:01] like gods to him it's really a form of
[38:05] self worship it really is it's at the
[38:10] root of humanism that you as a human
[38:15] being are the center of the universe and
[38:17] that everything is about you well I want
[38:21] you to know you're a very special person
[38:23] and you're a very special part I know of
[38:26] God's economy but it's not all about you
[38:29] it's all about God
[38:31] it's not the whole universe the whole
[38:34] world doesn't revolve around you and I
[38:36] as human beings rather it should revolve
[38:40] around the Creator the one who has given
[38:43] so much that we can have peace you know
[38:49] sometimes I hear agnostics say well God
[38:52] must really be a control freak because
[38:54] he wants everything done his way well I
[38:57] I'd be careful to say something like
[38:59] that but I understand how our mind our
[39:03] thoughts can be twisted when we're in
[39:05] rebellion against God you know you hear
[39:08] people say I don't believe that there is
[39:11] a God
[39:12] these people are followers of atheism or
[39:16] they call themselves atheist I've had a
[39:18] few that I've had an opportunity to
[39:21] speak to through the years and a couple
[39:23] of those people when they say to me
[39:25] boldly I don't believe in God and I said
[39:29] well that's alright God doesn't believe
[39:31] in atheist and neither do i God doesn't
[39:35] believe in atheist and I don't believe
[39:37] in atheists because I truly believe that
[39:40] most every individual on the planet is
[39:43] aware that there's something bigger
[39:45] something higher something more powerful
[39:50] than themselves
[39:52] maybe they call it the wrong thing
[39:55] maybe they go about devoting themselves
[39:58] to it in a wrong way but I believe that
[40:01] God knows how to speak up for himself
[40:04] and I pray for people like that I don't
[40:08] see and maybe you're like me I don't see
[40:10] how anyone could live in the world we're
[40:12] living in today see the beauty study a
[40:16] little bit about the human body and
[40:18] believe that that nature could just take
[40:21] its course and we would be where we are
[40:24] today in our world the intelligence that
[40:27] we have the technology that we have the
[40:30] beauty that the world has to offer there
[40:33] oh yes sir there is a divine creator
[40:36] there is a divine intelligence that's
[40:39] behind this creation that we all enjoy
[40:44] he desires not because he wants to
[40:47] control our lives but he desires that we
[40:51] submit to him because he wants to bring
[40:54] blessing into our life he wants to bless
[40:58] us and the most blessed life that anyone
[41:02] can live on planet Earth is a life that
[41:05] is laid down to Jesus Christ the one who
[41:09] gave everything that you and I would not
[41:13] only know peace while we're temporarily
[41:16] on this planet but that we could know
[41:19] peace for all eternity I would say that
[41:23] no matter who you are a god like that is
[41:26] worthy of your devotion a god like that
[41:29] is worthy that you would surrender your
[41:32] will and your weight to him rebellion
[41:35] can get down in us we think we know
[41:40] better than God we think we know a
[41:43] better way of doing things than the way
[41:46] that God has outlined in the scripture
[41:49] and this in itself is a scheme this in
[41:54] itself is a device that Satan is using
[41:58] to keep people from enjoying the full
[42:02] benefit of laying down your life for
[42:05] Jesus Christ serving him in real peace
[42:09] in real joy in real obedience the New
[42:13] Testament talks about rebellion and
[42:16] likens that also to witchcraft it's
[42:20] described witchcraft is described in two
[42:23] ways in the New Testament one as a work
[42:25] of the flesh and that's in Galatians and
[42:29] second as an evil spiritual power
[42:33] so witchcraft is not just necessarily
[42:37] incantations and dark magic and the
[42:41] things that that people get so
[42:43] interested in it seems but witchcraft is
[42:47] about control it's about manipulation
[42:51] it's about wanting to be in charge
[42:54] wanting to have authority Oh
[42:57] or something that we've not been given
[42:59] authority over in Galatians three one I
[43:04] believe we used this verse the last time
[43:07] we were together but I want to mention
[43:09] it again Galatians three one who has
[43:13] bewitched you that you should not obey
[43:16] the truth
[43:17] you see disobedience is being likened
[43:20] here to being bewitched under the
[43:26] influence of witchcraft who has
[43:29] bewitched you that you should not obey
[43:31] the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ
[43:35] was clearly portrayed among you as
[43:38] crucified did you know there were
[43:41] believers and that was the New King
[43:43] James I think did you know there were
[43:45] believers in the church at Galatia that
[43:48] had seen with their own physical eyes
[43:51] the crucifixion of Jesus Christ they not
[43:55] only saw with their eyes his crucifixion
[43:58] but they knew very well that he had
[44:01] resurrected from the dead they knew very
[44:05] well that he had ascended from Jerusalem
[44:08] into the heavenlies with a promise that
[44:13] I'm going away and if I go away I'm
[44:16] coming back in like manner they were
[44:19] aware of though of the instruction that
[44:22] was given to tarry in Jerusalem until
[44:25] you be endued with power from on high
[44:29] but just a few short years after the
[44:32] crucifixion and the resurrection and the
[44:35] Ascension of our Lord Jesus Christ there
[44:38] were some in the church in Galatia that
[44:41] were already under a spell even though
[44:44] their physical eyes had seen the reality
[44:47] of the crucifixion and the resurrection
[44:49] of our Lord they were already under this
[44:53] this bewitching spirit of rebellion to
[44:58] do their own thing to be their own
[45:01] somebody and believing that their idea
[45:05] was superior to God's idea bewitchment
[45:10] is defined
[45:11] the power to mislead as in using spells
[45:16] or hexes or incantations etc I don't
[45:22] believe Paul was mistaken when he chose
[45:25] to use a word that would mean such a
[45:27] thing because he was likening rebellion
[45:31] to this form of manipulation and control
[45:35] Satan Satan your enemy is the one who
[45:40] plants this seed or or spreads this
[45:44] influence of rebellion in your life
[45:46] where you start getting this this idea I
[45:49] know the better way I know I know how to
[45:51] live my life I have my rights and then
[45:54] this thing gets stronger and stronger
[45:56] until we are no longer submitted to the
[45:58] Lord and here were Christians followers
[46:01] of Jesus Christ who had fallen under a
[46:04] spell so to speak under the influence
[46:08] being misled it baffles my mind because
[46:14] these were people who saw him die who
[46:17] are very well aware of his resurrection
[46:20] and ascension the Greek word for
[46:24] bewitchment literally means to smite or
[46:27] to mislead with the eyes you know
[46:31] sometimes we can't believe what we see
[46:33] because the enemy will influence our
[46:36] vision he will cause us to see things in
[46:40] a perverted way which is a word that
[46:43] means twisting the enemy likes to twist
[46:47] truth the enemy will take God's Word and
[46:51] give you an alternative understanding of
[46:54] a scripture that's his plain as the nose
[46:55] on your face
[46:56] I hear people in this modern age that we
[47:01] live in taking God's Word and fixing it
[47:03] up to seemingly mean whatever it is they
[47:08] want it to mean how many of you know
[47:11] that's why God teaches us in the word
[47:13] how to apply the word how to approach
[47:16] the word and how to apply the word and
[47:18] that's by laying line upon line and
[47:20] precept upon precept that's not that's
[47:24] not by
[47:25] taking a verse of scripture and with a
[47:27] heart of rebellion twisting that to mean
[47:30] what we want it to mean because it would
[47:32] be more convenient I want you to know
[47:35] God's way is the best way God's way is
[47:37] the right way God's Way is the holy way
[47:40] and God's Way is the only way that has
[47:44] the benefits it has the blessing and not
[47:47] only blessing as we live on planet Earth
[47:50] but what about eternity what about
[47:53] eternity with him oh yes I believe yes I
[47:57] believe that there is a promise beyond
[47:59] this life I believe there's a home
[48:02] that's been prepared for the believer
[48:04] beyond this life and I also believe that
[48:07] the enemy will do anything and
[48:09] everything he can to bewitch us to
[48:12] manipulate us with a spirit of rebellion
[48:15] that says I don't doesn't matter what
[48:17] that what that says doesn't matter what
[48:18] the Bible said doesn't matter what the
[48:20] preacher says I'm gonna do it my way all
[48:22] God have mercy let's not fall into that
[48:25] trap because this is one of the schemes
[48:27] and the devices that the enemy uses in
[48:30] this hour
[48:31] I'll just read my note here Jesus had
[48:35] been crucified before the very eyes of
[48:37] some of these Galatian people and yet
[48:39] they were unable to see and obey this is
[48:43] the reason why we say that the work of
[48:45] the cross was obscured from before them
[48:47] they forgot what they saw the twisting
[48:51] influence of the enemy had caused them
[48:54] to no longer see clearly the death the
[48:59] price the blood that came streaming down
[49:03] before their eyes
[49:04] a perfect blood a blood created for
[49:09] salvation and redemption I'm telling you
[49:13] if anyone knew of the gift that had been
[49:16] given these Galatians knew it because
[49:20] unlike us they saw it with their
[49:23] physical eyes but Calvary the
[49:26] remembrance of what they saw the
[49:28] remembrance the memory of of the price
[49:32] that was paid it began to get
[49:34] howdy and blurry and obscured and before
[49:39] Satan before the enemy can lead us into
[49:42] rebellion or influenced us with
[49:45] bewitchment as defined in this verse of
[49:47] scripture before he can do that to a
[49:49] true believer the power of the cross
[49:53] must be obscured so the first thing he
[49:56] he tries to do before leading us
[50:00] completely astray is to cause us to
[50:05] forget what happened for us at Calvary
[50:09] if the enemy can disqualify you
[50:12] if he can somehow cause you to see
[50:15] yourself on the outside of what Jesus
[50:19] did at Calvary or he can diminish or
[50:23] devalue what took place on my behalf
[50:27] listen my behalf if I would have been
[50:31] the only one that needed him he would
[50:34] have gone all the way to the cross for
[50:37] me if you would have been the only one
[50:39] in all of history that would have needed
[50:41] his blood to be shared his life to be
[50:45] laid down I believe he would have gone
[50:48] all the way for you this is Grace it's a
[50:55] gift that I don't have words really to
[50:59] even explain how can we even comprehend
[51:02] but one of the ways we can make sure
[51:05] that it doesn't become obscured in our
[51:07] vision is keep it ever before us remind
[51:11] yourself often of the price that has
[51:15] been paid remind yourself often friend
[51:18] just quote the verse I am NOT my own as
[51:23] the apostle said I am NOT my own I have
[51:26] been bought with a price blessed be the
[51:28] name of the Lord and not a corruptible
[51:32] price one of gold or silver ore or
[51:35] treasure here on the earth but an
[51:37] incorruptible price the precious and
[51:40] perfect blood of the spotless lamb at
[51:43] Calvary keep your eyes on the cross
[51:48] don't allow even the modern songs of the
[51:52] church cause you to forget you know
[51:54] sometimes I listen to the words of our
[51:59] more popular worship music where it
[52:03] seems that so much of it focuses on our
[52:06] experience perhaps on our reaction to
[52:10] his presence and if you're finding the
[52:14] same thing I find find you some songs
[52:17] that focus on what he did on our behalf
[52:24] my oldest son Benjamin is 20 years old
[52:27] and he is one of the worship leaders in
[52:30] our church and he sings some of the
[52:33] modern worship songs and some of them I
[52:36] really enjoy some of them are not quite
[52:39] my cup of tea but there's not a feeling
[52:43] any sweeter than to hear him after maybe
[52:47] singing something a little more popular
[52:50] hear him lead us on a Sunday morning
[52:54] when peace like a river attendeth my way
[52:57] when sorrows like sea billows roll
[53:01] whatever my lot thou has taught me to
[53:03] say it is well it is well with my soul
[53:07] there's a verse in that hymn that talks
[53:11] about my sin not in part but in whole
[53:16] are nailed to the cross they're no
[53:21] longer before me brother when you begin
[53:25] to think on that truth or you sing the
[53:28] old hymn of the church victory in Jesus
[53:31] your he is he is our victory you've got
[53:38] to keep the truth of redemption the
[53:42] truth of salvation ever before your eyes
[53:44] you've got to remember if you do that
[53:49] friend it will be harder for the enemy
[53:52] to plant a seed or to cast a cloak of
[53:56] rebellion over your life he can't
[53:59] manipulate you if you keep
[54:02] the cross ever before you I hope you
[54:04] understand what good advice that is
[54:07] rebellion is a work of the flesh we read
[54:11] in Galatians 5:19 and 20 both witchcraft
[54:15] and idolatry are mentioned there is
[54:17] works of the flesh right next to
[54:19] adultery fornication hatred murder and
[54:21] drunkenness
[54:22] so so to to operate in rebellion against
[54:26] God's will and God's Way is as serious
[54:30] in the New Testament theology in the
[54:33] scripture of the New Testament as some
[54:35] of these other things that we are so
[54:38] dead set against and we stay as far away
[54:40] from as we possibly can I want you to
[54:43] know the enemy wants to operate
[54:45] illegitimate power over your life and he
[54:48] wants to cause you to move in rebellion
[54:53] and I believe there's power to break
[54:56] that over your life I believe that we
[54:59] can take some practical steps I I know
[55:04] that the modern church seems to be
[55:07] teaching in many places that repentance
[55:09] is no longer necessary I just see the
[55:13] Apostle Paul who had been through a
[55:16] whole lot more than I've been through
[55:17] and and he said I die daily every day I
[55:22] have to come back to Calvary and
[55:24] remember that when he died I was in him
[55:27] the scripture is clear every day I have
[55:31] to go back and remember my death was in
[55:34] him and there are some things in my life
[55:38] that I have to keep putting them under
[55:39] submission to the Word of God to the
[55:43] authority of God it may sound a little
[55:46] old-fashioned but obedience is what God
[55:49] is looking for in our life and if we
[55:51] don't walk before him with His grace and
[55:54] to obey Him we are opening up our life
[55:58] in fact I have a highlighted note here
[56:00] every time I insist on having my own way
[56:03] I expose myself to satanic or demonic
[56:08] influence and I believe that I believe
[56:11] when we choose our own way and reject
[56:15] the way of God and what God has called
[56:17] us to in his word we are swinging open
[56:20] the door for complete rebellion against
[56:23] who God is and what he has accomplished
[56:25] on our behalf at the cross
[56:27] I know we've prayed twice already but in
[56:30] the moment I have left I'd like to pray
[56:32] again Father in the precious name of
[56:35] Jesus Christ I ask Lord for the gift to
[56:40] every believer who's watching right now
[56:42] that you would renew our vision of the
[56:44] Cross would you let us keep the work
[56:48] that you accomplished for us in that
[56:52] bloody sacrifice would you help us Lord
[56:55] to remember it to keep it ever before us
[56:58] to keep our eyes on you and remember
[57:03] what you have done for us and on our
[57:07] behalf and Lord I repent right now of
[57:10] any area of my life where I have been
[57:13] rebellious or where I choose continue to
[57:16] choose my way over your way I pray right
[57:19] now you'll give my friends the same
[57:21] grace to repent to say Lord in any area
[57:25] of my life where I keep doing my own
[57:29] thing instead of your thing I repent I
[57:33] ask for your forgiveness and I ask you
[57:36] Lord to teach me how to yield myself
[57:39] teach my friends Lord how to yield
[57:42] themselves more and more to your
[57:44] precious love to your precious grace we
[57:47] ask this in the name of the Lord Jesus
[57:49] Christ
[57:50] I'm so glad unsaved I'm glad I'm
[57:53] sanctified I'm glad that I'm filled with
[57:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire
[57:59] you can have the same experience
[58:02] seek the Lord thank you for watching the
[58:05] program today I've thoroughly enjoyed
[58:07] sharing my heart
