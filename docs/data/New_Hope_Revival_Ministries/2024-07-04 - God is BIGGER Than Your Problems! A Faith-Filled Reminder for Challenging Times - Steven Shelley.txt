TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I want to remind you church that our God is greater than our enemy in every way in every way God's word defeats his enemy a and the one that has set out to destroy your life is already defeated and if we'll stop agreeing with him he has to tuck tail the Bible said submit yourselves therefore unto God resist the devil and you don't have to run from him what's the word say he'll flee from you but you're presented with an opportunity now moving forward toward the end of your destiny to to make sure that the report you give is one that says God is bigger than my problem he's bigger than my circumstance don't look at the bigness of your problem but rather look at the bigness of your God it's not easy to do that in the Heat of the Moment we've all been in those situations but when we choose to agree with the Lord in his word then we give a good report the best we can maybe our voice is trembling you know maybe we don't feel very strong but we're holding on to faith and giving God an opportunity to work don't shut God out of your circumstances let him in and let him have his way it's coming your promise is not as far away now as it was yesterday every day you wait for it every day you T for it in faith brings it one day closer if you spend the day in turmoil without faith you really push you push the promise you push the promise a little further out in the future somebody said you do that by your faith and your report well according to the word you do I'm just telling you what the book said we're waiting to recognize whose authority is within us the authority of Jesus Christ the first part of the creation of God brother if he's backing you up if you've got the word backing you up you don't have to be afraid of a family of giants you don't have to be afraid of somebody trying to intimidate you on your job you don't have to be afraid of peer pray you're at school if you know that you know that you know you're part of him the Bible tells us that those who know their God shall be what strong and do what exploits amazing demonstrations of God's character power and authority exploits there's a bride in the earth positioning by the spirit now getting in sync with our marching orders that are not of Earth they're not earthy they're coming from another place they're coming from an eternal realm and we're discovering that it's important for us to get in synchronization alignment with what the spirit is saying remember that before God speaks prophetically to the church ages he says hear what the spirit yes sir is saying to the church so the hearing choosing to hear is part of the alignment
