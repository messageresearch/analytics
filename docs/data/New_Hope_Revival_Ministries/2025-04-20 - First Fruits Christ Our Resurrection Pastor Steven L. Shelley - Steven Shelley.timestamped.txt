[39:11] they're getting these logs and trees,
[39:14] huge trees from the hurricane and
[39:17] dragging them for great distances. It's
[39:20] it's hard work. It's dangerous work.
[39:23] They need the grace of God. Brother and
[39:26] Sister Gley are in
[39:29] uh where is it?
[39:30] Ohio. Napoleon, Ohio preaching this
[39:34] morning and the last two days. May God
[39:37] be with him and bless him. I know he has
[39:38] at least one
[39:39] engagement of on Thursday of this week
[39:42] for brother Dwey Moss and then next
[39:45] weekend for the former Amish in Indiana.
[39:48] Let's ask God to be with him. Uh Ben and
[39:52] his family are away for the weekend.
[39:54] Hawk is flying out right now as we speak
[39:56] to
[39:57] Mexico for extensive work uh on his
[40:01] teeth, his mouth, his jaw. He will have
[40:04] to have implants and no one even really
[40:07] knows yet what all will be involved. But
[40:10] God has made a way for him to have it
[40:12] done and it will be a serious affair.
[40:16] Sister Terry is home this morning with
[40:18] Sister Gertrude because she's unable to
[40:20] get out of bed. Sister Gertrude and
[40:22] Sister Terry is there as her soul
[40:25] caretaker while Sister Rebecca's gone.
[40:28] Let's ask the Lord to visit Sister Terry
[40:30] today and uh touch her body and
[40:33] strengthen her. And also Sister
[40:35] Gertrude. My old friend, Brother
[40:37] Jonathan is in need of prayer. His
[40:40] blood platelets are low and he has a
[40:43] shoulder surgery coming up and needs to
[40:45] be remembered. Brother Russ Dunker, my
[40:48] friend uh from Wisconsin, needs to be
[40:52] remembered to the Lord. And uh we want
[40:54] to pray for the meetings in Indiana this
[40:56] week. Anybody else who's traveling that
[40:59] God will watch over them and keep them.
[41:02] There's such a wonderful presence of the
[41:03] Lord
[41:05] here. We want to believe that God will
[41:08] help us today.

[42:25] In his
[42:26] arms I
[42:28] feel
[42:31] protected. In his
[42:34] arms never
[42:39] disconnected. In his
[42:41] arms I
[42:43] feel protected.
[42:46] There's no place I'd
[42:49] ra be. Let's sing that

[45:14] we ask you would move. Let your healing
[45:17] angel come by that way.
[45:22] Lord, for those who are working in
[45:24] dangerous conditions, we ask, Lord, that
[45:26] you will be with them. Let your angels
[45:28] surround them. Keep them safe, oh Lord.
[45:32] Give them strength. Keep them alert, oh
[45:35] Lord, as they work. For all those who
[45:37] are traveling the dangerous highways, we
[45:40] ask that you would line the line the
[45:42] highways with your angels. Be with them.
[45:46] Surround them, oh God, as they travel.
[45:49] As dad is preaching in Ohio, we ask, oh
[45:52] Lord, that you would anoint his lips. Oh
[45:54] God, speak through him.
[45:58] May it be a move like they have not seen
[46:01] before. Oh God, be with them as they
[46:04] travel on to the next place. And he
[46:06] speaks. Oh God, we ask that you'll be
[46:08] with them. Jesus,
[46:11] we ask Lord as the word goes forth today
[46:14] here in this house that you will be with
[46:16] our pastor.
[46:18] May your anointing cover him, oh God.
[46:22] May your anointing fill this whole room,
[46:25] Lord. May we hear the words from you.
[46:29] Lord, let my ears be open to hear what
[46:32] you would have to speak to
[46:33] me. I thank you, Lord, that you are
[46:36] changing me
[46:38] to be like you
[46:40] because that's what I want to be. Wonder

[48:32] clap of praise this
[48:36] [Music]
[48:40] morning. You may be seated this morning.
[48:43] Elas and Brother Shaw, would y'all mind
[48:44] and come and help me with the offering
[48:46] this morning? Let's go ahead and pray
[48:47] for it. Lord Jesus, bless his ties and
[48:50] offering. Use it for your work in your
[48:52] kingdom. Lord Jesus, multiply it and
[48:54] give it back to the giver. In the name
[48:55] of Christ, I pray. Amen. Let's worship
[48:57] with brother Kade as he sings.
[49:14] [Music]
[49:44] There is a
[49:47] blood that calls false
[49:51] life that paid my
[49:55] way and death its
[49:59] price when it
[50:02] flowed down from the
[50:06] cross. My sins were
[50:10] gone. My sins forgone.
[50:13] [Music]
[50:15] There is a
[50:18] grave that tried to
[50:22] hide this precious
[50:26] blood that gave me
[50:30] life. And in three
[50:33] days he breathed
[50:37] again and rose to
[50:41] stand in mighty faith.
[50:50] So I
[50:52] come to tell you he's
[50:55] alive to tell you that he
[50:59] dries. Oh every tear that falls.
[51:05] So I
[51:07] come to tell you that he
[51:10] saves and to shout and to
[51:14] proclaim that he's coming back for
[51:19] you. There is a
[51:23] blood. Oh, it sits the
[51:27] blind. It heals the sick.
[51:31] [Music]
[51:32] lonely
[51:34] finds. And it has the
[51:38] power to free the
[51:42] bound as chains they
[51:45] fall upon the
[51:49] ground. So pour it out.
[51:53] Lord come cleanse my
[51:56] soul and let it
[52:01] liquid. Glory
[52:04] flow because he
[52:08] lives to make me
[52:11] whole. I owe my
[52:15] life. I owe my all.
[52:22] So I come, so I
[52:25] come to tell you he's
[52:29] alive and to tell you that he
[52:32] dries. Oh, every tear that
[52:37] falls. And so I
[52:40] come to tell you that he
[52:43] saves or to shout and to
[52:47] proclaim that he's coming back for you.
[52:52] Oh, so I come to tell you he's
[52:58] alive and to tell you that he
[53:02] dries every tear that falls.
[53:07] Oh, so I come oh to tell you that he
[53:13] saves and to shout and to
[53:16] proclaim that he's coming back for
[53:21] you. And there is a
[53:25] blood. It cost a
[53:28] life and he paid my
[53:32] way and death its price.
[53:37] And when he
[53:39] flowed down from the
[53:43] cross, well, my sins were gone. So were
[53:46] yours this morning. My sins
[53:50] forgone. And there is a
[53:54] grave. Oh, and it tried to
[53:58] hide. There's precious
[54:01] blood. It keeps giving me life.
[54:06] And in three
[54:09] days he breathed
[54:12] again and he rose to
[54:16] stand and mighty
[54:18] [Music]
[54:23] f. And so I
[54:26] come to tell you he's
[54:30] alive. Oh, to tell you that he
[54:34] dries every tear that
[54:37] falls. Oh, so I
[54:41] come to tell you that he saves. Oh, to
[54:45] shout and to
[54:48] proclaim that he's coming back for you.
[54:53] Oh, so I
[54:55] come to tell you he's
[54:59] alive and to tell you that he
[55:02] dries. Oh, every tear that
[55:06] falls. Oh, and so I
[55:10] come to tell you that he saves. Oh, to
[55:14] shout and to
[55:17] proclaim that he's coming back for you.
[55:22] Oh, this
[55:25] blood. Oh, this
[55:29] blood. His precious blood. He's coming
[55:33] back for you.
[55:37] Oh, so I
[55:39] come to tell you he's
[55:42] alive and to tell you that he
[55:47] dries every tear that
[55:50] [Music]
[55:51] falls. So I
[55:54] come to tell you that he
[55:57] saves and shout and to
[56:01] proclaim that he's coming back for you.
[56:07] So I
[56:08] come to tell you he's alive.
[56:13] To tell you that he
[56:17] tries every tear that falls.
[56:22] And so I
[56:24] come to tell you that he
[56:27] saves and to shout and to
[56:31] proclaim that he's coming back for you.
[56:38] Praise God. There is a blood. Why don't
[56:41] we give the Lord a real hand clap of
[56:45] praise? Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[56:49] Hallelujah. Bless his
[56:53] name. Hallelujah. Bless his name. I said
[56:58] hallelujah.
[57:00] Bless his name. He's wonderful.
[57:06] He's wonderful and worthy to be praised.
[57:10] Hallelujah. You may be seated. He's
[57:13] good. He's an ontime God.
[57:18] He's faithful in every one of his ways.
[57:25] Hallelujah.
[57:36] So thankful for the presence of the Lord
[57:40] that's in the front of the church this
[57:41] morning.
[57:44] I hope you can feel it where you
[57:53] are. It's life to us. It's not about
[57:58] feelings, but it's life to us to be able
[58:01] to connect to
[58:03] him. There's nothing wrong with feeling
[58:06] him. Nothing wrong with a little bit of
[58:09] emotion.
[58:10] If there's no emotion that that just
[58:12] sort of testifies that it's death. How
[58:15] many of you are not dead? How many of
[58:18] you are very much alive because of Jesus
[58:21] Christ? We're alive because of him. Uh
[58:25] let's sing uh just a a chorus or a bit
[58:28] of the blood will never lose its power
[58:31] before we go to the word. I'm a little
[58:34] discombobulated. Do you know what that
[58:36] means?
[58:37] [Music]
[58:40] And it
[58:43] reaches to the
[58:47] highest
[58:51] mountain and it
[58:54] blows to the
[58:58] lowest valley.
[59:02] Oh, the
[59:04] blood that gives me
[59:08] strength from
[59:10] day to
[59:13] day. It will
[59:16] never
[59:19] lose its power.
[59:22] [Music]
[59:25] It
[59:27] soothes all my
[59:29] doubts and it
[59:31] calms all of my
[59:35] fears
[59:37] and oh, it
[59:41] dries
[59:42] all of my tears.
[59:46] It's the
[59:47] blood that gives me my
[59:51] strength from
[59:53] day to
[59:56] day. It will never
[59:59] never
[1:00:01] lose its
[1:00:03] power. Let me hear your voice. Oh, it
[1:00:09] reaches to the highest.
[1:00:17] Sometimes it
[1:00:20] flows to the
[1:00:23] voice lowest
[1:00:26] valley. Oh, the
[1:00:30] blood that gives me
[1:00:33] strength from
[1:00:36] day to
[1:00:38] today. It will
[1:00:42] never never lose its
[1:00:47] power. Sing this part with me again. It
[1:00:52] suits all my
[1:00:55] doubts and it
[1:00:57] calms all of my
[1:01:01] fears
[1:01:03] and and it
[1:01:06] dries
[1:01:08] all my tears.
[1:01:12] It's the blood that gives me
[1:01:16] strength from
[1:01:19] day to
[1:01:22] today. It will never, never, never
[1:01:27] lose its power. One last time, it'll
[1:01:31] reach wherever you are. Oh, it
[1:01:35] reaches to the
[1:01:37] highest, highest mountain.
[1:01:41] And this same blood it will
[1:01:46] flow to the
[1:01:48] lowest sin cursed
[1:01:52] valley. Oh, it's the blood. It's the
[1:01:57] blood that gives me strength from
[1:02:02] day to
[1:02:05] day. It will never never
[1:02:08] never lose.
[1:02:10] No, it will never never never lose. I
[1:02:16] said it will never never never
[1:02:20] lose its
[1:02:25] [Music]
[1:02:27] power. Oh, I thank God. It never will
[1:02:30] lose its
[1:02:32] power. Its power is the life, the Zoe
[1:02:37] life of God. The power of the blood, the
[1:02:41] potency of the blood is the life that's
[1:02:44] within it. And it's it's not animal life
[1:02:47] and it's not life of a human being. It's
[1:02:50] God's own life. It's Zoe. Say that with
[1:02:53] me. It's Zoe. It's God's eternal life.
[1:02:58] It's life that has always existed. Do
[1:03:00] you believe that? We should thank God
[1:03:03] because uh with quite a few missing,
[1:03:06] nearly 40 I counted uh that I knew
[1:03:11] wouldn't be here. But we are so thankful
[1:03:14] for these musicians, the sacrifices that
[1:03:17] have been made. Benjamin and Jenna flew
[1:03:19] in late last night so they wouldn't have
[1:03:21] to miss another service and to help us
[1:03:24] this morning. And many sacrifices have
[1:03:27] been made. And uh you know I miss those
[1:03:30] who are not here but I couldn't myself I
[1:03:33] couldn't feel any difference. I'm
[1:03:35] thankful for that. Sometimes it it's
[1:03:39] distracting to people because the ones
[1:03:41] they're familiar with or whatever loved
[1:03:43] ones are are missing and they don't
[1:03:45] connect as well. Our prayer was that it
[1:03:48] wouldn't hinder anybody and it certainly
[1:03:50] I don't know about you but it certainly
[1:03:52] didn't hinder me because he was here.
[1:03:55] He's here and I believe he's going to
[1:03:57] meet every need. But let's thank God for
[1:03:59] these
[1:04:02] musicians, leading of the worship. And
[1:04:08] uh you may be seated again for just a
[1:04:12] moment. We're so happy to see you,
[1:04:14] Logan. with so many missing. I mean,
[1:04:17] anytime you being here would be special,
[1:04:19] but with so many missing, it was
[1:04:22] particularly a blessing to look back and
[1:04:24] see you looking all sharp and uh I feel
[1:04:28] like a son has come home to us this
[1:04:30] morning. We're very thankful to see
[1:04:32] [Applause]
[1:04:35] you, Alana. It's so good to see you.
[1:04:38] We're so glad that you've come through
[1:04:39] your surgery. We know you're not all the
[1:04:42] way on the other side yet, but you're a
[1:04:44] trooper and you're at church this
[1:04:46] morning. And that is a real blessing.
[1:04:48] Sister Cindy's sister-in-law. Let's
[1:04:50] welcome her and thank God for her being
[1:04:52] here
[1:04:53] [Applause]
[1:04:55] today. The Holy Ghost is here. I want
[1:04:57] him to be welcome. Don't you?
[1:05:00] Amen. That's right, Sister Flo. We can
[1:05:02] clap for everybody else.
[1:05:06] We want to thank God for Levi also being
[1:05:09] here this morning to help us with the
[1:05:11] stream. He's just come off his shift at
[1:05:14] the fire department and uh is here this
[1:05:16] morning and we needed him because uh
[1:05:19] Joseph is at camp and the other boys and
[1:05:23] brother Hawk is on his way to to Mexico
[1:05:25] and um we we just very thankful that he
[1:05:29] could be here and thankful that that
[1:05:31] R.J. was able to stay. He was he offered
[1:05:34] to take Hawk to the airport and that
[1:05:36] would have been a blessing to Hawk. I
[1:05:38] know. But we're just thankful that when
[1:05:40] he realized we needed him to help us up
[1:05:42] there that he he stayed to do that. I
[1:05:45] appreciate that very much. Um God is
[1:05:48] good all the time.
[1:05:50] Tomorrow is Luke Jernigan's birthday.
[1:05:52] He's still one of ours and we miss him
[1:05:54] very much and we're praying for him
[1:05:57] every day. And tomorrow is his birthday
[1:05:59] and we're looking forward to seeing what
[1:06:01] God's going to do in his life. Tomorrow
[1:06:03] is also Nathan and Shosana's wedding
[1:06:06] anniversary. How many is this, Nathan?
[1:06:09] Seven. Well, that's a good number. How
[1:06:12] did those seven years pass so quickly?
[1:06:15] Seemed like we were just making that
[1:06:16] international
[1:06:18] journey to
[1:06:20] Michigan. I'm so happy for what seven
[1:06:23] years have brought us. And I told Nathan
[1:06:26] he could have brought Edith up here to
[1:06:27] pray, couldn't he? Wouldn't know nobody
[1:06:29] been bothered by that. I looked at them
[1:06:32] during worship. The presence of the Lord
[1:06:34] was already pretty strong around me. And
[1:06:36] I looked over there at him and her shoes
[1:06:38] were off and she was standing on her
[1:06:41] daddy's tops of her daddy's feet and he
[1:06:44] was moving back and forth worshiping the
[1:06:46] Lord and she was having the time of her
[1:06:48] life. She's a worshshiper.
[1:06:51] And I thought that was particularly
[1:06:53] special that she was standing on her
[1:06:55] daddy's feet. Most of us would have
[1:06:57] enjoyed the thought of being able to
[1:06:59] have done that. Edith is blessed enough
[1:07:01] to do it. I'm thankful. I'm very, very
[1:07:04] thankful. Um, this Friday, April 25th,
[1:07:07] is Abigail Bote's birthday. Faithful
[1:07:10] streamers in Calgary, originally from
[1:07:13] Ghana, West Africa. We send our love all
[1:07:16] the way north of the border to her. And
[1:07:20] also this Friday, Sister Judith comes
[1:07:23] home for just about a week. And uh we're
[1:07:27] very happy to have her home for just a
[1:07:30] few days. She's very actively involved
[1:07:33] in caring for her parents who are still
[1:07:37] uh giving God praise and glory for his
[1:07:39] faithfulness to them in their life. and
[1:07:42] Sister Judith doesn't get to be here
[1:07:43] with us very often during this time. So,
[1:07:46] we're very much looking forward to
[1:07:48] having her uh here with us next weekend
[1:07:51] and I think she will have to leave
[1:07:53] before the before the weekend following
[1:07:56] the memorial service is the weekend
[1:07:59] after that for brother Samuel Johnson
[1:08:01] who passed away, a worldclass
[1:08:04] missionary. And if you were here when
[1:08:07] brother Colin gave his testimony, I I
[1:08:10] think it was a Tuesday night, wasn't it?
[1:08:12] It wasn't on a Sunday. Uh the young man
[1:08:15] who's serving our Lord in in Israel with
[1:08:18] his family, we don't always say where,
[1:08:21] but uh we just did um serving the Lord
[1:08:26] and under very difficult and uncertain
[1:08:30] times. And it was because of brother
[1:08:33] Johnson that brother Colin came off the
[1:08:37] streets and gave his heart to the Lord.
[1:08:40] And you, if you were here, you heard his
[1:08:42] testimony. He picked up the phone book
[1:08:45] and began to look for churches with the
[1:08:47] name Bible in it. And I think that was
[1:08:50] the right word. And there were several
[1:08:52] that uh had machines or whatever. But
[1:08:55] the first live person was the church of
[1:08:58] Brother Samuel Johnson. Now, by the way,
[1:09:00] that building where I think I might have
[1:09:03] met Sister Alfreda for the first time
[1:09:05] was in that building is now a a church
[1:09:08] that belongs a believing church that
[1:09:11] belongs to to believers there with
[1:09:13] Pastor Gabriel Toari who's very good
[1:09:17] friends of Hawk. It's wonderful to see
[1:09:19] that building recycled and used for the
[1:09:22] glory of God. another entirely different
[1:09:25] congregation in there worshiping and
[1:09:27] carrying on the work of the Lord. But uh
[1:09:30] there was just a few older people there
[1:09:32] that morning. He called, got the got the
[1:09:35] information for the services. He went
[1:09:37] over just a few older people quite small
[1:09:39] the church was of course at the time and
[1:09:42] he's sitting there hearing these things
[1:09:44] for the first time and he's telling
[1:09:46] himself, "Well, I'll I won't be back
[1:09:49] here. I'm pretty sure of that." But he
[1:09:51] said that he, Brother Johnson, came down
[1:09:53] the aisle and grabbed his arm and and
[1:09:56] and smiled real big and said, "We're so
[1:09:58] glad to have you and we'll see you
[1:10:00] Wednesday
[1:10:02] night." And he said, "I don't know what
[1:10:04] was wrong with me. I don't know what was
[1:10:06] even going on." I said, "Yes, you will."
[1:10:10] He said, "After I've been sitting there
[1:10:11] that whole time thinking I'll never be
[1:10:13] back here again. You never know what
[1:10:15] God's doing."
[1:10:17] And uh not only did God bring him in,
[1:10:19] save him, fill him with the Holy Ghost,
[1:10:21] but he served there for several years as
[1:10:23] the associate pastor and began his
[1:10:25] ministry there. And so we want to give
[1:10:28] honor. I I know that uh vessels are
[1:10:31] flawed. Humans are flawed. I I've
[1:10:33] certainly been flawed. But it's the
[1:10:35] right thing to do when someone uh
[1:10:37] continues on, does their repentance,
[1:10:40] continues on, goes on for God like
[1:10:43] brother Johnson has done. It's it's
[1:10:45] right to remember the good that he swed
[1:10:49] into many many many lives. Mine
[1:10:52] including the reason why brother Colin
[1:10:55] and I were ever connected is he was down
[1:10:58] in the basement of that church praying
[1:10:59] in a prayer meet in a in a private time
[1:11:01] of prayer and he looked up and saw a box
[1:11:04] on the shelf and he got up there and it
[1:11:06] was old cassette tapes of when we were
[1:11:08] there in the early 90s. He put them in
[1:11:11] and God touched his heart and connected
[1:11:13] us together. Aren't we blessed to have
[1:11:16] them working for the Lord so faithfully?
[1:11:19] And we claim them as part of us. We're
[1:11:21] looking forward to getting to see them
[1:11:22] again. Uh we have some that are uh that
[1:11:26] are not well, some children that are not
[1:11:28] well, fighting to get well. Um Aiana not
[1:11:32] feeling well today, but we're believing
[1:11:33] the Lord will just make her whole. He's
[1:11:36] still a healer.
[1:11:38] Oh, I feel his healing power. I know
[1:11:41] that he is a healer. I pray for sister
[1:11:45] Flo. Uh she's traveling this week. Can
[1:11:47] you imagine? I mean, I'm I'm still
[1:11:49] processing this, Jason, in my mind.
[1:11:52] She's uh getting on an airplane and uh
[1:11:56] going to Indiana for a meeting. It's
[1:11:57] just hard to hold her down, isn't it?
[1:12:00] And if Jesus terries and she's a
[1:12:02] hundred, she better not walk up here and
[1:12:04] tell me I'm going to Indiana.
[1:12:07] But we're thankful that she feels good
[1:12:09] enough and and and is is going to go
[1:12:12] whether she does or not. And those
[1:12:14] people are going to be very blessed to
[1:12:15] have her. And Jonathan's leaving
[1:12:18] tomorrow for Indiana and he's going to
[1:12:19] swing by the airport and pick her up and
[1:12:22] take her on. And I think that's bold and
[1:12:26] and it's courageous and I would expect
[1:12:28] nothing more or nothing less out of
[1:12:30] Sister Flo. But we all want to pray for
[1:12:32] her. that old airplane is a is a it's a
[1:12:36] petri dish of germs. And uh we want to
[1:12:39] pray that God will so protect her with a
[1:12:41] holy protection that that she uh her
[1:12:45] presence on that plane brings healing to
[1:12:47] other people that's sick. Well, it can
[1:12:49] be that way. Peter's shadow uh had so
[1:12:52] much of the virtue of God in it that
[1:12:54] when he passed by, the sick were healed.
[1:12:57] Uh somebody said, "Well, we're not
[1:12:59] Peter. We're not the apostles." No, in
[1:13:01] fact, we're part of a double portion
[1:13:03] generation and we should uh we should be
[1:13:06] healing with our presence going and
[1:13:08] coming.
[1:13:10] Even when there's no shadow, right?
[1:13:13] Let's go to the word. If you're able to
[1:13:14] stand, please do that. Uh those of you
[1:13:17] who knew, we didn't we didn't make a
[1:13:19] public announcement for various reasons,
[1:13:22] but we were away for three nights. uh
[1:13:25] left Wednesday morning early and uh I
[1:13:29] appreciate the Lord for making it
[1:13:30] possible. We didn't have a place to stay
[1:13:33] until 11:30 on Monday night, but we
[1:13:37] needed a little distraction with
[1:13:38] Elelliana gone. We're so glad to have
[1:13:41] her back and I guess her mom and daddy,
[1:13:44] too, because they're a package. But
[1:13:46] we're very glad to have her back, even
[1:13:48] though she's being a little finicky with
[1:13:50] me. Uh uh I I believe that before the
[1:13:53] day is over, I'm going to have a very
[1:13:55] serious talk with her and it's all going
[1:13:57] to be all right. She's going to remember
[1:13:59] who Pap is and uh well, she's calling my
[1:14:02] name, but but uh she's and and she's
[1:14:06] doing Joshua the same way and he's just
[1:14:08] he just is having a struggle. So pray
[1:14:10] for him because he's a he's one of those
[1:14:14] doing
[1:14:15] uncles. Uh I don't call any day
[1:14:19] resurrection day. I call every day
[1:14:21] resurrection day. But the reality is
[1:14:23] resurrection is not a day. Has nothing
[1:14:26] to do with a day. It's a person. His
[1:14:28] name is Jesus. Somebody said, "What do
[1:14:31] you mean?" I mean just what he said. He
[1:14:33] said, "I am the resurrection.
[1:14:37] I am personified." That's who I am. How
[1:14:39] many of you have him? If you have him,
[1:14:42] you have the anastasis, which is the
[1:14:44] resurrection. A and that word anastasis
[1:14:47] uh is a unique word because it actually
[1:14:49] means reproducible resurrection. And
[1:14:52] that means his resurrection was of such
[1:14:54] a nature that it has reproduced a
[1:14:57] resurrection in all of us. Did you know
[1:14:59] you were once dead in your sins and
[1:15:01] trespasses and on your way to hell?
[1:15:04] That's where he went when he died and
[1:15:07] you were on your way to hell. But aren't
[1:15:10] you glad that God gave you an anastasis?
[1:15:13] gave you a resurrection. Praise God. I'm
[1:15:17] glad for that. Uh would you turn to
[1:15:20] Leviticus chapter
[1:15:22] 23? God bless you to all the
[1:15:26] streamers. I'll be as quick as I'm
[1:15:28] capable of being. And uh I didn't
[1:15:30] mention that Ginger is back from uh the
[1:15:33] island of Iceland and we're very glad to
[1:15:36] have her home for a little while. Praise
[1:15:38] God.
[1:15:41] And I suppose she's going to be pretty
[1:15:43] anxious to have her girl, baby girl,
[1:15:46] baby in quotation marks, home uh from
[1:15:49] camp later this evening. It' be a great
[1:15:52] reunion for them, I'm sure. Leviticus
[1:15:55] chap 23 verse
[1:15:59] 9-14. God bless you. I think I mentioned
[1:16:01] streamers, but all of you, especially
[1:16:03] those of you who've reached out to say
[1:16:05] hello. We love you. We send our love
[1:16:07] across the world, South Africa, and so
[1:16:10] many other places. God bless you.
[1:16:12] Leviticus
[1:16:13] 23:9. And the Lord spake unto Moses,
[1:16:17] saying, Speak unto the children of
[1:16:20] Israel, and say unto them, When ye be
[1:16:23] come into the land which I give unto
[1:16:26] you, and shall reap the harvest thereof,
[1:16:31] that ye shall bring a sheath of the
[1:16:34] first fruits of your harvest unto the
[1:16:38] priest. I want to read that last line
[1:16:40] again. You shall bring a sheath of the
[1:16:45] first fruits of your harvest unto the
[1:16:48] priest. This would be a good time to
[1:16:51] pause for just a moment and say that
[1:16:54] we're glad that Charity Grace made it
[1:16:56] home for church. She left this morning
[1:16:57] at 5:30 and drove all the way from North
[1:17:01] Carolina, really the Tennessee line to
[1:17:04] be here for church to serve the Lord, to
[1:17:07] worship the Lord that most importantly
[1:17:09] and secondly to run the computer for
[1:17:12] me. Would you just thank God for that
[1:17:17] faithfulness? Had to leave her husband
[1:17:19] home uh at back at work to do it. Then
[1:17:22] you shall bring a sheath of the first
[1:17:24] fruits of your harvest unto the priest,
[1:17:27] and he shall wave the sheath. I want you
[1:17:31] to get that in your mind. I want you to
[1:17:33] make an image of a priest standing out
[1:17:36] in the
[1:17:37] field. This particular time of the year
[1:17:41] is the barley harvest. During the time
[1:17:44] of Pesak, Passover, and the feast of
[1:17:47] unleavened bread, the barley comes in.
[1:17:50] And 50 days later the wheat harvest
[1:17:53] starts coming and they will be making
[1:17:56] bread for Pentecost and waving the bread
[1:17:59] also over the people uh according to the
[1:18:03] same portion of scripture. But now we're
[1:18:06] talking about the barley harvest. And uh
[1:18:10] we are instructed that when you finally
[1:18:12] get into that promised land, then you're
[1:18:15] going to take the the first fruits, the
[1:18:18] the the barley that is ripened first,
[1:18:22] and you're going to go out and gather
[1:18:24] that. Leave the rest behind. You're
[1:18:26] going to gather that together into a
[1:18:29] sheath, which is a bundle. And then
[1:18:32] you're going to the priest is going to
[1:18:35] wave that sheath before the Lord to be
[1:18:39] accepted on your behalf to be accepted
[1:18:42] for you. On the tomorrow after the
[1:18:45] Sabbath, the priest shall wave it. So
[1:18:51] that would be after the weekly Sabbath
[1:18:54] during the feast of unleavened bread.
[1:18:57] I'm I'm I'm uh unfortunately I must tell
[1:19:00] you that's not today on anybody's
[1:19:03] calendar. That already happened earlier
[1:19:06] in the week because God only keeps one
[1:19:09] calendar and that's the one in the
[1:19:11] Bible. You understand that, don't you?
[1:19:13] That's how he gave it to us. And so this
[1:19:16] is already passed, but we're we're
[1:19:18] looking at it because the emphasis today
[1:19:21] is on first fruits. It's on
[1:19:23] resurrection. So we want to remember
[1:19:25] what his resurrection fulfilled. His
[1:19:28] death fulfilled the sacrificial lamb at
[1:19:31] Passover and his purity, his divine
[1:19:35] nature fulfilled the elements of the
[1:19:39] unleavened bread. And now his
[1:19:42] resurrection anastasis life has
[1:19:45] fulfilled to the letter the the biblical
[1:19:49] type and shadow of the feast of first
[1:19:52] fruits which is yam
[1:19:55] habikarim. And uh it's a powerful truth.
[1:19:59] I want to get a little more of it into
[1:20:00] you today if the Lord will let us. Ye
[1:20:04] shall offer that day when you wave the
[1:20:07] sheath uh and he lamb without blemish of
[1:20:11] the first year for a burnt offering unto
[1:20:14] the Lord. And the meat offering thereof
[1:20:17] shall be two tenth uh deals of fine
[1:20:21] flour mingled with oil, an offering made
[1:20:24] by fire unto the Lord for a sweet savor.
[1:20:27] And the drink offering thereof shall be
[1:20:29] of wine, the fourth part of an hen. Do
[1:20:34] you notice the meticulous instructions
[1:20:37] of God? This is God's instructions. And
[1:20:41] he tells them exactly how much wine to
[1:20:43] pour out as an offering. And the meat
[1:20:46] offering thereof would be two ten deals
[1:20:49] of fine flour mingled with oil. An
[1:20:52] offering made by fire unto the Lord of a
[1:20:54] sweet savor. the drink offering thereof
[1:20:57] of wine, the fourth part of an hen. And
[1:21:00] that's h i n, not h e n. And ye shall
[1:21:04] eat neither bread nor parched corn, nor
[1:21:07] green ears until the selfsame day that
[1:21:11] ye have brought an offering unto your
[1:21:13] God. Notice that you are not to partake
[1:21:16] of the harvest, even though there is
[1:21:20] ripened grain. You are not to take it
[1:21:23] until you have first gathered first
[1:21:26] fruits and offered it as worship unto
[1:21:30] the Lord. Then you can take what's
[1:21:32] what's left. That that's the whole
[1:21:34] concept of first fruits. God first. You
[1:21:38] see that creator first and then the
[1:21:41] rest. Then you can take it and enjoy it.
[1:21:45] And you shall eat neither bread nor
[1:21:47] parched corn until the selfsame day that
[1:21:50] you brought an offering unto your God.
[1:21:52] It shall be a statute forever. Somebody
[1:21:56] say forever.
[1:21:58] So even though the reality and
[1:22:00] fulfillment is here, it's still a good
[1:22:02] thing to remember the type and the
[1:22:05] shadow. That's what the Bible said. In
[1:22:07] fact, he said, "Let that be a memorial.
[1:22:10] Let it be something that you remember
[1:22:12] every year. Let it be a cycle, a
[1:22:15] repeated behavior every year. Mention
[1:22:18] these things. Talk about these things.
[1:22:20] And then give God praise for bringing
[1:22:23] them all to pass in fulfillment. Thi
[1:22:25] this shall be a statute forever
[1:22:27] throughout your generations in all your
[1:22:31] dwellings and in other places. He says,
[1:22:33] "And the stranger thereof in your
[1:22:35] midst." And we're thankful that he has
[1:22:38] made provision. Father, we thank you
[1:22:40] today that
[1:22:42] you before there was a Garden of Eden,
[1:22:45] before there was an Adam, in your mind,
[1:22:49] you had uh a plan of redemption and
[1:22:54] salvation and deliverance that is so
[1:22:59] detailed. It catches it gives us the
[1:23:01] ability to catch a glimpse of your
[1:23:05] meticulous nature and how
[1:23:09] You you could have made it so much
[1:23:12] easier, but you wanted it to be so
[1:23:16] detailed that there would be no doubt in
[1:23:18] our minds that you had fulfilled it to
[1:23:22] the jot and to the tit and to the very
[1:23:26] letter of the instruction. Lord, I thank
[1:23:29] you for that. That revelation has shaped
[1:23:33] my life in in incredible ways.
[1:23:37] It has caused me to know you in a
[1:23:40] different way. To know that if you care
[1:23:44] so much about every measurement, every
[1:23:47] color that is used and how it is to be
[1:23:51] even given to you, then you must also
[1:23:56] care about every detail of my life. The
[1:24:00] revelation tells me that there's not a
[1:24:03] sparrow that falls to the ground that
[1:24:06] you don't notice or a hair fall out in
[1:24:10] my hairbrush that you don't sub subtract
[1:24:13] from your memory. The very hairs of our
[1:24:15] head numbered. The liies are clothed by
[1:24:20] a divine creator every spring. I don't
[1:24:23] want to take that for granted. I want to
[1:24:26] live under the
[1:24:28] awesome responsibility and the awesome
[1:24:32] privilege of worshiping a God who cares
[1:24:36] about every detail.
[1:24:38] You want me to have the right automobile
[1:24:41] and you want me to have the right job
[1:24:44] and you want me to uh to have the right
[1:24:47] friends and the right connections and
[1:24:49] the right uh uh church and and so many
[1:24:53] things you care about, the right
[1:24:57] companion. And Lord, I thank you for
[1:24:59] that kind of care. It overwhelms me at
[1:25:02] times, but I rest in you knowing that
[1:25:06] you've got everything under control.
[1:25:09] May every person in this place and under
[1:25:12] the sound of my voice, may they receive
[1:25:14] that revelation even in greater ways
[1:25:16] than I have, so that they never feel
[1:25:20] alone. So that they never feel left out
[1:25:23] or uncared for by their creator. What an
[1:25:27] awesome papa you are. Help us in your
[1:25:31] word today to grasp the
[1:25:35] precision with which you have fulfilled
[1:25:37] every requirement and request. And we'll
[1:25:40] give you glory and honor and praise for
[1:25:42] it's in the mighty name of Yeshua, the
[1:25:45] Lord Jesus Christ, our Messiah we pray.
[1:25:49] And the saints said, "Amen." Amen. You
[1:25:51] may be seated. I better hurry.
[1:25:55] In numbers chapter 28 and verse
[1:25:59] 26, it goes on to say also in the day of
[1:26:03] the first fruits. Would you say first
[1:26:06] fruits with me? The King James version
[1:26:09] of the Bible puts the two words
[1:26:11] together. First
[1:26:13] fruits. Many other places you'll see it
[1:26:16] written in as two separate words.
[1:26:19] Remember that if you're ever doing a
[1:26:21] search, it can really make it a little
[1:26:23] more difficult to find every place where
[1:26:26] this is mentioned. In the day of the
[1:26:29] first fruits, when you bring a new meat
[1:26:31] offering unto the Lord, after your weeks
[1:26:34] be out, ye shall have an holy
[1:26:38] convocation. Ye shall do no serval work.
[1:26:42] Now, this is talking about the seven
[1:26:45] additional Sabbaths or memorial days
[1:26:50] that are given to us in scripture to be
[1:26:55] remembered. Every week there is a
[1:26:57] Sabbath, 52 Sabbaths of the year. And
[1:27:01] sometime during that day from evening to
[1:27:05] evening it's a good thing for you to
[1:27:08] remember that even God had need to rest.
[1:27:14] It's a good idea for you to remember uh
[1:27:18] and the Sabbath is and will always
[1:27:22] be from Friday evening until Saturday
[1:27:25] evening. I I don't believe that we have
[1:27:29] the right to rename the Sabbath and say
[1:27:33] that it's Sunday and Sunday is the
[1:27:35] Christian Sabbath. I don't say that
[1:27:38] because God is the one who chose the day
[1:27:40] of the week for the Sabbath.
[1:27:42] Nonetheless, we meet together on Sunday
[1:27:46] for various reasons. One of which, it's
[1:27:48] a day that we have off work. A lot of
[1:27:50] people in Israel, it's the first day of
[1:27:53] the work week and everybody goes back to
[1:27:56] work. So, it's a little difficult as a
[1:27:59] believing a Messianic believer in Israel
[1:28:02] to to worship. You just couldn't nearly
[1:28:04] hardly worship on Sunday. You would have
[1:28:07] to meet together also on the Sabbath.
[1:28:09] I'm not a Sabbathke keeper in the sense
[1:28:12] that I think that Sunday worship is the
[1:28:15] mark of the beast like some large
[1:28:18] Christian
[1:28:20] groups Christian with parenthesis teach
[1:28:24] that if you go to church on Sunday
[1:28:26] you're a part of the mark of the bee. I
[1:28:28] don't believe that for one moment. I
[1:28:30] believe we ought to go to church every
[1:28:32] day when there's a service to be in. If
[1:28:35] we can get there, we ought to get there.
[1:28:37] Because remember, Sabbath is more than a
[1:28:40] day. Sabbath is a person. Are you with
[1:28:44] me? Resurrection is more than a day.
[1:28:48] Passover more than a day.
[1:28:51] Uh first fruits, more than a day.
[1:28:54] Shàuote, Pentecost, more than a day.
[1:28:57] It's more than an experience. It's a
[1:29:00] person. And we go into the New
[1:29:02] Testament, we could say the same. Feast
[1:29:04] of trumpets more than a day. It's the
[1:29:07] reality of a person who's coming back.
[1:29:10] Praise God for that. And soot or
[1:29:13] tabernacles more than a day, more than a
[1:29:15] week, more than a holiday. It's a person
[1:29:20] because God himself will tabernacle with
[1:29:24] men. That is a powerful promise. He has
[1:29:27] fulfilled that in us and he will fulfill
[1:29:31] it in a further measure in eternity
[1:29:34] because we never have to leave his
[1:29:36] sight. We never have to leave his
[1:29:39] presence again throughout all eternity.
[1:29:42] He makes his abode with us and we make
[1:29:45] our eternal abode with him. Now that
[1:29:47] ought to excite anybody to get to live
[1:29:50] forever with the Messiah. Hallelujah. If
[1:29:54] you believe what I believe that uh that
[1:29:56] brother Brandham had inspiration from
[1:29:58] the Lord as a prophet then you will also
[1:30:01] believe what he said that God is so uh
[1:30:05] multiaceted. That's my word. But this
[1:30:08] was the concept he presented. There's so
[1:30:11] much to God that he will continue to
[1:30:15] unveil and reveal himself to us
[1:30:18] throughout all eternity. Can you imagine
[1:30:22] peeling off the layers of an onion for
[1:30:24] all eternity? You think you know
[1:30:26] everything there is to know about
[1:30:28] Messiah and he opens up another entirely
[1:30:32] something, some revelation, some
[1:30:34] inspired truth that we didn't even know
[1:30:36] about him. Somebody said, "Why would he
[1:30:39] do that?" Then we fall in love with him
[1:30:40] all over again. Hallelujah. And he just
[1:30:44] peels off another revelation of who he
[1:30:47] is. And maybe he lets you catch a
[1:30:49] glimpse of a time in your life that you
[1:30:52] were not aware that he was with you,
[1:30:54] that he was present with you. And then
[1:30:56] you fall in love with him all over
[1:30:58] again. And you get to do that over and
[1:31:00] over and over again throughout all
[1:31:01] eternity. For those of you who would
[1:31:03] rather sit on a fluffy cloud, wear a
[1:31:06] diaper, play a
[1:31:08] harp, you're going to be greatly
[1:31:10] disappointed.
[1:31:12] Heaven doesn't look anything like that,
[1:31:14] and neither will eternity. It's going to
[1:31:16] be a glorious worship service,
[1:31:19] a testimony time like there's never been
[1:31:22] before. And there doesn't ever have to
[1:31:24] be an end to it because there is no
[1:31:27] time. Once we get out of the millennium,
[1:31:30] there is no more measurement of time.
[1:31:32] Somebody said, "You don't really
[1:31:34] believe." I do.
[1:31:36] I do really believe. I really believe
[1:31:38] that that's the way it's going to be.
[1:31:40] I'll tell you this. You don't want to
[1:31:42] miss it. Amen. You don't want to miss
[1:31:44] it. Stay with me now. So then in
[1:31:48] Proverbs 3:9, I think I was saying there
[1:31:51] are 52 regular weekly Sabbaths and then
[1:31:54] seven additional uh Sabbaths that are
[1:31:57] given to us during the feast of the
[1:31:59] Lord. So there's one additional feast
[1:32:02] during Passover. And that's why there's
[1:32:05] been so much confusion about what day of
[1:32:07] the week Jesus was crucified because the
[1:32:11] scripture says that it was the day of
[1:32:13] preparation before the Sabbath. His body
[1:32:15] had to be taken down. Gentiles read that
[1:32:19] in the time of King James. And they say,
[1:32:22] "Well, even we know the Sabbath is
[1:32:24] Friday evening to Saturday evening." The
[1:32:27] problem is only John picked up the
[1:32:31] nuance. That there's a little more to it
[1:32:34] than the weekly Sabbath. Because
[1:32:36] according to the Old Testament, the
[1:32:38] scripture tells us that there is an
[1:32:40] additional Sabbath given during the week
[1:32:42] of unleven bread during the time of
[1:32:45] Passover. And that is a high Sabbath.
[1:32:48] It's a memorial to remember so that you
[1:32:51] don't work, you give the time to God.
[1:32:54] And if you're in Israel during that
[1:32:56] time, I'm telling you, traffic stops.
[1:32:58] Everything comes to a screeching halt.
[1:33:01] And there are no stores open. And so if
[1:33:04] you don't have groceries before both
[1:33:06] high Sabbath and weekly Sabbath, the
[1:33:08] only time that a store is open is on the
[1:33:11] intermediary days, the days in between,
[1:33:13] you could be hungry. You could be
[1:33:15] knocking on your neighbor's door.
[1:33:17] Because when they say closed, guess what
[1:33:19] they mean?
[1:33:22] Closed. No. No driving around, no
[1:33:25] shopping around. It is to be a time of
[1:33:29] memorial. And so these gentile
[1:33:33] uh translators, they didn't understand
[1:33:35] the nuance of of the high Sabbath. And
[1:33:38] so they said had to be a Friday because
[1:33:40] that's day of preparation before the
[1:33:42] weekly Sabbath. The problem is we know
[1:33:45] that that particular time there were two
[1:33:48] Sabbaths and one was all day uh the day
[1:33:52] after his crucifixion all day Friday and
[1:33:55] then the weekly Sabbath began. So
[1:33:57] they're back to back and that can really
[1:34:01] be a problem in trying to decide the day
[1:34:05] of his resurrection. The key is always
[1:34:08] this. Just remember this. There's
[1:34:10] nothing to argue about, but this is the
[1:34:12] key. It has to be according to the sign
[1:34:16] of the prophet Jonah.
[1:34:18] Jesus said, "So has to be three days and
[1:34:24] three nights, not three portions of days
[1:34:27] or three portions of night." Somebody
[1:34:29] said, "Well, in Esther, the fast said
[1:34:32] three days." But then it said before the
[1:34:35] third day was over, Esther went in
[1:34:37] before the king. We're not talking about
[1:34:39] a fast. We're talking about a messianic
[1:34:41] sign. That's right. Esther wouldn't have
[1:34:44] been the only one that moved before a
[1:34:46] fast was
[1:34:49] over. You're supposed to smile. That's
[1:34:52] assuming that any of you have ever
[1:34:54] fasted because those last few hours
[1:34:58] can be hard. So Esther wasn't the only
[1:35:01] one that said, "I better get up and save
[1:35:02] my people before the sun goes down."
[1:35:06] This was an entirely different thing. So
[1:35:09] the fast was three days and the fact
[1:35:11] that she ended a little quick and went
[1:35:13] into the king is not a problem. It has
[1:35:15] absolutely nothing to do with the
[1:35:17] resurrection. Jesus was specific and he
[1:35:20] said as as Jonah was in the belly of the
[1:35:24] fish, so must the Son of Man be in the
[1:35:27] heart of the earth for how long? Three
[1:35:30] days and three nights. And three nights.
[1:35:33] It has to be that way. I don't care who
[1:35:35] called Friday
[1:35:38] good. There was no such thing until the
[1:35:41] Roman Catholic Church in AD
[1:35:45] 3:25 made this ruling. You can't even
[1:35:48] blame Constantine for this. The church
[1:35:50] is responsible. The church said, "We
[1:35:52] don't want to have anything or any
[1:35:54] connection any longer with the Jews."
[1:35:57] That's why they mistransated the word
[1:35:59] pasca in the New Testament and put in
[1:36:02] the word Easter. Can you imagine? Can
[1:36:05] you imagine something that never even
[1:36:08] truly existed as a Christian festival?
[1:36:11] They put the word in because they wanted
[1:36:13] to separate themselves from the Jews.
[1:36:16] That's anti-semitism at its best, or
[1:36:19] should we say at its worst. And then
[1:36:22] they said, "We're going to change the
[1:36:24] date of the celebration of resurrection.
[1:36:27] And we're no longer going to do as
[1:36:30] Christians had done from the from the
[1:36:32] beginning of the day of Pentecost all
[1:36:35] the way up to the time of we could say
[1:36:38] 3:24 AD. Passover was the time that both
[1:36:43] the death and the resurrection was
[1:36:45] celebrated.
[1:36:46] 300
[1:36:48] years until they decided we're going to
[1:36:52] disconnect Passover and resurrection.
[1:36:55] And we're going to put resurrection on a
[1:36:57] Sunday. Of course, we are. And we're no
[1:37:00] longer going to uh choose the date based
[1:37:02] on the lunar calendar that God
[1:37:04] established. We're going to do it on the
[1:37:06] sun calendar. And that's why Christians
[1:37:09] all over the world woke up this morning,
[1:37:11] turned their faces toward the sun.
[1:37:16] and worship the wrong God.
[1:37:20] Now, I know that's going to go over like
[1:37:22] a rat sandwich, but the reality is
[1:37:25] somebody said, "Well, what's what I
[1:37:26] purpose in my heart?" Not. So,
[1:37:30] it's not what you purpose in your heart,
[1:37:32] it's what thus sayaeth the Lord says.
[1:37:36] It's what the Bible said. The scripture
[1:37:39] is the absolute. And so the problem with
[1:37:42] doing that, going out and waking up
[1:37:44] early and turning your face toward the
[1:37:46] sun is God's not represented by the sun.
[1:37:51] That's the wrong God.
[1:37:53] He's not represented by that. That's a
[1:37:55] product of the church and how the so
[1:37:58] many things were altered. This Roman
[1:38:00] system has affected our lives in ways
[1:38:02] that we don't realize. Why does that
[1:38:05] even matter? It matters because if
[1:38:07] you're trying to present the reality of
[1:38:10] the resurrection, you do understand
[1:38:12] there's multitudes of people that don't
[1:38:14] even believe he rose from the dead.
[1:38:15] That's right. Do you remember many years
[1:38:17] ago Josh McDow wrote a book about
[1:38:19] proving the resurrection? And he wrote
[1:38:21] it to Christians
[1:38:23] because there were Christians in
[1:38:25] mainline evangelical churches that had
[1:38:28] chosen to no longer believe in the
[1:38:30] physical resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:33] Hello. Just like many major mainline
[1:38:36] denominations have chosen to no longer
[1:38:38] believe in the virgin birth
[1:38:41] or in the power of the blood.
[1:38:45] So if you think these things are
[1:38:47] overemphasized among us, you must
[1:38:49] understand that we're
[1:38:51] salmon swimming against a tide that
[1:38:55] never stops.
[1:38:57] The Roman system continues to mark march
[1:39:01] toward the faith. Yeah. Doing anything
[1:39:05] and everything it can to shift our
[1:39:07] attention from the only one true living
[1:39:10] God who represented him in the himself,
[1:39:15] excuse me, who represented himself in
[1:39:17] the feast of the scripture. They want us
[1:39:20] to be so so
[1:39:22] disconnected and in doing so they said
[1:39:25] we won't even have the resurrection
[1:39:27] celebration connected to Passover
[1:39:29] anymore. In fact, have you noticed that
[1:39:31] many years is not even the same month?
[1:39:36] So, how could Jesus fulfill the feast of
[1:39:38] first fruits at Easter when when
[1:39:40] Passover is already
[1:39:44] passed? Why does it
[1:39:47] matter? It matters because you may one
[1:39:50] day have to present this gospel to an
[1:39:52] agnostic
[1:39:54] or an atheist,
[1:39:56] Zach. And it's important that you know
[1:39:59] what's right because there are people
[1:40:02] out there who don't believe any of it.
[1:40:04] So, and you let them find a little
[1:40:06] loophole like uh he wasn't even in the
[1:40:09] tomb for three days and three nights and
[1:40:11] they'll run away with it. The Bible said
[1:40:14] it's important for you and I to be able
[1:40:16] to answer for the faith that we hold.
[1:40:19] You got to know what you believe.
[1:40:22] I don't want to go too far into this
[1:40:24] with a visit or two here and maybe some
[1:40:26] streaming, but I want to clearly say you
[1:40:30] must know what you believe. And you what
[1:40:33] you believe must be rooted and grounded
[1:40:36] in the scripture, not in orthodox
[1:40:38] tradition, but in the scripture. And if
[1:40:42] you can find it in the scripture, I'm
[1:40:45] going to I'm going to say, well, then
[1:40:46] we've got to look at that very carefully
[1:40:48] if it's something we're not looking at
[1:40:50] already. Let the saints say, "Amen."
[1:40:53] Proverbs 3:9, "Honor the Lord with thy
[1:40:59] substance and with the first fruits of
[1:41:02] all thine increase." So the Bible is
[1:41:06] clear to us that this is not talking
[1:41:08] about our
[1:41:10] tithe. When we give God tithe, we are
[1:41:14] giving him one10enth
[1:41:17] 10% of what we make. Not particularly
[1:41:21] what we go bring home after we have paid
[1:41:24] our bills.
[1:41:26] You understand that what's taken out of
[1:41:29] our check is a bill that has to be paid.
[1:41:32] Sometimes it's insurance. Sometimes it's
[1:41:35] retirement. Sometimes it's this.
[1:41:37] Sometimes it's that. Sometimes it's the
[1:41:39] other. So we give God not second fruits.
[1:41:43] Not when everybody else has taken their
[1:41:45] hands off of it.
[1:41:48] Let me just take a little water. You
[1:41:50] didn't know I was going to preach. I
[1:41:51] don't hardly ever preach on tithe.
[1:41:56] Not when everybody else has got their
[1:41:58] peace.
[1:42:00] First, somebody say first. What's the
[1:42:03] benefit of that? It says to God above
[1:42:05] and beyond, I trust
[1:42:08] that if I do what your word said and I
[1:42:11] give you the first, I give you what
[1:42:13] belongs to you. I trust that you will
[1:42:15] provide for me.
[1:42:19] And if I borrow what belongs to you
[1:42:21] according to scripture, I am to pay
[1:42:25] back interest.
[1:42:28] So you don't want to borrow from what
[1:42:30] doesn't belong to you in the first
[1:42:31] place. How's that possible? You want to
[1:42:34] give God what belongs to him. First
[1:42:36] fruit is not the tithe, but tithe is to
[1:42:38] be given in a first fruit way.
[1:42:42] Off the top, we might say. In fact, the
[1:42:44] scripture does say that's exactly what
[1:42:47] the scripture does tell us. But first
[1:42:49] fruit is something that God is asking
[1:42:52] for above and
[1:42:55] beyond. It doesn't have to be scads of
[1:42:59] money. It can be something as simple in
[1:43:02] Bible times as the first tomato on your
[1:43:06] vine.
[1:43:08] You say, "Well, how in the world am I
[1:43:09] going to give that to the Lord?" You do
[1:43:12] that by giving it to some of God's
[1:43:14] people, by sharing what you have. And
[1:43:17] you can count on Sister Joyce, who is
[1:43:20] not here today. Let's preach about her.
[1:43:23] You can count on her that she's going to
[1:43:26] bring the first tomato, the first snow
[1:43:29] [Music]
[1:43:31] pee. I I certainly can't make much of a
[1:43:34] meal with one snow
[1:43:37] pee. You understand? But she's going to
[1:43:40] bring that to to the one who's serving
[1:43:43] God as her priest. She's going to bring
[1:43:46] that every year regardless because she
[1:43:48] said, "I know what happens when I do."
[1:43:50] She learned many years ago when we were
[1:43:52] teaching on first fruits. If you give
[1:43:54] God what belongs to him, he touches the
[1:43:57] rest.
[1:44:00] That's what scripture said. He touches
[1:44:02] the rest. He blesses the rest. When you
[1:44:06] when someone gives to the poor, when
[1:44:08] someone gives, pays it forward and does
[1:44:11] the different things that people do
[1:44:12] sometime showing acts of kindness and
[1:44:15] charity. Do it unto the Lord. Don't just
[1:44:18] do it under your neighbor. Do it unto
[1:44:20] the Lord and watch and see if God won't
[1:44:23] bless you. Somebody ought to say amen.
[1:44:25] Well, you're just another preacher
[1:44:27] preaching on money. Listen, folks. I'm
[1:44:29] not asking for anything in addition to
[1:44:31] what God's asked of you. I'm not looking
[1:44:33] for money and I'm not looking to you for
[1:44:36] my source of anything except prayer.
[1:44:40] But the Bible is the Bible.
[1:44:43] The scripture is the scripture. And I
[1:44:45] don't know about you, but I want to be
[1:44:47] right standing with God. If I can do in
[1:44:49] some simple way what God is asking me to
[1:44:52] do, and he's going to turn around and
[1:44:53] open the windows of heaven and bless me
[1:44:55] in such a manner that I don't have room
[1:44:57] enough to contain it. And some of us are
[1:45:00] lagging behind now because we've stolen
[1:45:03] from God for so long.
[1:45:09] That we never can get ahead. So at some
[1:45:13] point we have to come clean with him.
[1:45:15] Honor the Lord with thy substance and
[1:45:20] with the first fruits of all thine
[1:45:24] increase. Give it to God as fast as you
[1:45:28] can and you won't even miss it because
[1:45:31] it's already out of your hands. Amen.
[1:45:35] When somebody gives you a $10 bill, just
[1:45:37] know that a dollar of that belongs to
[1:45:39] the Lord and just say, "Thank God for
[1:45:41] the $9 that I have." That's the way I
[1:45:43] live. It's the way I live and it
[1:45:47] works. Woo! They're shouting down the
[1:45:49] aisle at New Hope this
[1:45:52] morning. I know you know it. I know you
[1:45:54] believe it that you're the most faithful
[1:45:56] people to give that I've
[1:46:00] kn to mention it from time to time.
[1:46:03] First fruits represents the initial
[1:46:05] harvest, consecrating the rest to God
[1:46:08] and foreshadowing resurrection, new
[1:46:11] life, and divine acceptance for all of
[1:46:14] us. It's tied directly to Passover,
[1:46:16] which is redemption, and to the feast of
[1:46:18] unleaven bread, which is purity. Jesus
[1:46:21] fulfilled the feast of of uh first
[1:46:25] fruits in the same way that he fulfilled
[1:46:28] the feast of Passover. He did it by
[1:46:30] rising on the third day, which is Nissan
[1:46:34] 17. Somebody check your your uh calendar
[1:46:37] and see what today is on on the on the
[1:46:41] lunar calendar. What is today on
[1:46:45] yours? Say it again.
[1:46:48] Nissan
[1:46:49] 22. So, we're already quite a few days
[1:46:53] past the feast of first fruits. But it
[1:46:57] won't hurt any anything to come in here
[1:46:59] and sing more songs about the
[1:47:01] resurrection.
[1:47:02] I didn't hear but one song that we don't
[1:47:04] sing in any other service. Two songs.
[1:47:07] One is He Lives, He Lives, which happens
[1:47:10] to be one of my favorite hymns. And we
[1:47:13] sung it Tuesday night as we were
[1:47:14] leaving. So it's okay to sing it more
[1:47:17] than on an Easter Sunday they call it.
[1:47:20] Um and then the new song that we sung
[1:47:23] those are the the rest of them who talk
[1:47:25] the songs that talk about resurrection.
[1:47:27] We may sing them any Sunday or any
[1:47:29] Tuesday and we should because his
[1:47:32] resurrection is something we should
[1:47:34] honor and celebrate every day. But when
[1:47:38] you think about the fact that even his
[1:47:41] resurrection fulfilled the shadow and
[1:47:43] type of what was outlined in Leviticus
[1:47:46] and in numbers and in several other
[1:47:48] places, it only adds to the amazing God.
[1:47:53] I mean, he is an incredible creator and
[1:47:58] savior and redeemer. to have thought of
[1:48:01] all of this, to have laid it all out, to
[1:48:05] have chosen the very hour that Jesus
[1:48:07] would die with all the other Passover
[1:48:10] lambs and the very hour that he would
[1:48:12] rise from the dead before the sun.
[1:48:17] I love the fact that Jesus beat the sun.
[1:48:22] s u n
[1:48:25] the s o n beat the s u n up to fulfill
[1:48:32] the feast of first fruits. I'll show you
[1:48:34] that again in a moment. So Jesus
[1:48:36] fulfilled it by rising on the third day
[1:48:39] which is Nissan 17 after spending three
[1:48:42] days and three nights in the heart of
[1:48:44] the earth. He was the first fruits as
[1:48:48] the very first to conquer death and to
[1:48:51] make resurrection possible for all of
[1:48:53] you and for me. 1 Corinthians 15 20.
[1:48:57] Let's move a little faster. That'll be
[1:48:59] on me. But now is Christ. Now is Messiah
[1:49:05] risen from the dead. And look what the
[1:49:08] New Testament says. And he has become
[1:49:13] the what?
[1:49:15] Say it again. He has become the first
[1:49:18] fruits of them that
[1:49:21] slept.
[1:49:23] Powerful. The first s o n to come to
[1:49:29] maturity. He got up out of the grave and
[1:49:32] he beat the su n up over the horizon.
[1:49:36] That's the God we serve. He conquered
[1:49:39] death not only for himself but for every
[1:49:42] one of us.
[1:49:44] He became the first fruits of those who
[1:49:46] had died of those who had slept and he
[1:49:50] has fulfilled every requirement. We look
[1:49:54] at the word first fruits. It is a
[1:49:57] parquet in Greek and it means
[1:50:01] firstlings which is the first lamb or
[1:50:04] the first cow
[1:50:07] uh calf that is born firstling or first
[1:50:12] fruits. It is the first portion of the
[1:50:15] dough from which sacred loaves were to
[1:50:18] be prepared.
[1:50:20] these these loaves of bread that we will
[1:50:23] talk about at Shàuote at
[1:50:26] Pentecost. Even the dough, they had to
[1:50:30] take a a handful of that dough out and
[1:50:33] offer it unto the Lord before they baked
[1:50:35] the big beautiful loaves of bread to
[1:50:38] wave before the Lord. God said, "I want
[1:50:40] the first I want the first
[1:50:43] biscuit." I mean, that's what he said
[1:50:45] here. I I want the first handful of the
[1:50:48] dough. Somebody said, "Well, that just
[1:50:50] sounds like a greedy God to me." Folks,
[1:50:52] he's teaching us something. Honor me
[1:50:55] first. Yes.
[1:50:57] Put me first. Worship me first. Seek me
[1:51:01] first. He said, "The greatest
[1:51:03] commandment is to love the Lord thy God
[1:51:06] with all of your heart, with all of your
[1:51:07] mind, with all of your strength." And
[1:51:10] the second greatest commandment is not
[1:51:12] honor the Sabbath. It's not thou shalt
[1:51:14] not murder.
[1:51:15] The second greatest commandment is to
[1:51:17] love thy neighbor
[1:51:20] as you've loved yourself. That's what
[1:51:22] Jesus said. We have to love even the
[1:51:25] unlovable.
[1:51:27] Can't you say amen? Person superior in
[1:51:31] excellence to others of the same class.
[1:51:33] That's also a way that the word aparquet
[1:51:36] is used in the Greek, meaning one who
[1:51:38] has risen to the top like the cream of
[1:51:41] the milk. And I want you to know if
[1:51:43] anybody ever rose to the top, Yeshua,
[1:51:46] Jesus, our Messiah, he rose to the top.
[1:51:50] He was the first creation of God. He was
[1:51:53] the first created son.
[1:51:56] And he was perfect in all of his ways.
[1:51:59] If you believe that, say amen. So, we're
[1:52:02] looking at Jesus, our first fruits, the
[1:52:04] risen savior who fulfills the entire
[1:52:08] word. He does in every way. We've seen
[1:52:11] him as the Passover lamb slain on Nissan
[1:52:14] 14 in 1 Corinthians 5:7. It says, "Purge
[1:52:18] out therefore the old leaven that ye may
[1:52:20] be a new lump as ye are unleavened, for
[1:52:24] even Christ our Passover is sacrificed
[1:52:28] for us." We've seen him as our Passover.
[1:52:30] We've seen him as our unleavened bread.
[1:52:33] The next verse, 1 Corinthians 5:'8,
[1:52:35] therefore let us keep the feast, not
[1:52:37] with old leaven. This is New Testament.
[1:52:40] Not with old leavenven, neither with the
[1:52:42] leavenven of malice and wickedness, but
[1:52:44] with the unleavened
[1:52:46] bread of what?
[1:52:50] Sincerity and what? Truth. Oh, well, if
[1:52:54] you're
[1:52:56] sincere, how many of you understand that
[1:52:59] sincerity is not the only requirement?
[1:53:02] Have you ever been sincere and been
[1:53:04] sincerely wrong? Yes.
[1:53:07] How long
[1:53:10] ago? Some of you less than 3 hours.
[1:53:14] Sincere with what you were doing, but
[1:53:17] sincerely
[1:53:18] wrong. Not enough to be sincere. We're
[1:53:22] bringing the unleaven bread of both
[1:53:24] sincerity,
[1:53:25] zeal, passion, and truth. Without truth,
[1:53:30] your sincerity is without value.
[1:53:35] If it's not grounded in truth, then to
[1:53:38] be sincere has no value. But if you're
[1:53:41] grounded in truth, the the most
[1:53:43] beautiful thing is to approach him in
[1:53:46] sincerity. If you understand that, say
[1:53:48] amen. So we know that he fulfilled the
[1:53:51] Passover 14. He fulfilled the entire
[1:53:55] week of the feast of unleavened bread,
[1:53:57] which is now since second temple period,
[1:53:59] since New Testament period. The whole
[1:54:01] week is referred to as Passover. But in
[1:54:04] the Bible, Passover was only one day.
[1:54:07] The rest of the week, the feast of
[1:54:08] unleaven bread. But since the time of
[1:54:11] Yeshua, it is known as Passover week,
[1:54:14] which is an entire week. He fulfilled
[1:54:17] that 14. And the entire week of
[1:54:20] unleavened bread. Today, we're shouting
[1:54:22] again because we've seen that he
[1:54:24] fulfilled the other part. He fulfilled
[1:54:26] the feast of first fruits. He rose from
[1:54:28] the dead on Nissan 17, perfectly
[1:54:32] fulfilling this feast of first fruits.
[1:54:35] And we have a lot to be thankful for.
[1:54:37] Israel waved the first barley sheath
[1:54:40] every year, trusting God for the
[1:54:43] harvest. It's this concept. If this
[1:54:46] little bunch, I want you to see this.
[1:54:49] Look up here. If this little handful of
[1:54:53] barley got mature, then what about all
[1:54:56] these other little uh sprouts out here
[1:55:00] in the field? If God is the God of
[1:55:03] harvest and the God of creation and the
[1:55:06] God of agricultural reproduction, then
[1:55:09] the same God who brought this bundle
[1:55:12] to full maturity is the same God who
[1:55:16] knows how to bring the rest of the field
[1:55:19] to maturity. It's such a prophetic and
[1:55:21] spiritual concept. You see, the
[1:55:24] scripture said in the New Testament, he
[1:55:26] became the first fruits of them that
[1:55:28] slept. If God is able to raise the son,
[1:55:33] the sen the Messiah,
[1:55:36] God man, body dead, deity left, if God
[1:55:41] is able to refill that body with deity
[1:55:44] and raise it up out of that grave, the
[1:55:47] same God is able to do the same for you
[1:55:50] and I. Should we one day lay here in a
[1:55:52] box, we can the rest of us who survive
[1:55:56] can walk out of here knowing that we
[1:55:59] will meet him again. We will meet her
[1:56:02] again in a new body.
[1:56:05] It won't be decrepit. It won't be
[1:56:07] wrinkled. It won't be arthoritic.
[1:56:10] It won't be artificial,
[1:56:12] but it'll be whole. And that same
[1:56:15] resurrection reminds us that as heroes,
[1:56:18] first fruits, you and I are going to
[1:56:20] rise again.
[1:56:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:25] Hallelujah.
[1:56:27] Yam
[1:56:28] habikarim. Israel waving this barley
[1:56:32] proving Jesus doing the same. getting up
[1:56:36] before the
[1:56:38] sun, beating the women there, as I told
[1:56:41] you last week, ringing their hands. Oh,
[1:56:44] I think Tuesday night I told you they're
[1:56:47] ringing their hands. Oh, who's going to
[1:56:49] roll away the stone? We have prepared
[1:56:51] the spices. We bought them before the
[1:56:53] first Sabbath. We prepared them after
[1:56:55] the second Sabbath. And now we're going
[1:56:57] to bring them. And I said that for those
[1:56:58] of you who are studying the the the
[1:57:01] course of events because there's also
[1:57:03] controversy because two two of the
[1:57:05] gospels, one gospel says before the
[1:57:07] Sabbath, one says after the Sabbath and
[1:57:09] and the the the uh the clarity comes
[1:57:12] when you realize they were purchased in
[1:57:14] one gospel. It talks about and they were
[1:57:16] they were
[1:57:17] prepared and understand that this wasn't
[1:57:20] just sprigs of rosemary and uh and time.
[1:57:25] This was this was aromatic gums, resins,
[1:57:28] and oils that were used to prepare the
[1:57:32] body. That takes you've got to get it
[1:57:34] first, and then you've got to prepare it
[1:57:36] next. And you want to get there as soon
[1:57:38] as you can when the Sabbath has ended.
[1:57:41] So, they get up before the sun rises.
[1:57:44] They're walking to the tomb. How are we
[1:57:45] going to roll away the stone? Remember,
[1:57:47] there wouldn't have been a stone rolled
[1:57:49] there normally. That happened because
[1:57:51] they were going to doubt that he was
[1:57:53] going to rise from the dead. Remember
[1:57:55] they went to Pilate, they went to
[1:57:57] Caiaphas and they said he they're going
[1:57:59] to steal him. The disciples are going to
[1:58:02] steal him. His followers, his talmade
[1:58:06] are going to steal him and then tell
[1:58:08] people that he raised. So you've got to
[1:58:10] seal the stone and put a a guard of
[1:58:13] Roman centurions there to guard the
[1:58:15] tomb. So that really threw a wrench in
[1:58:18] anointing his body. So they're who is
[1:58:21] going to roll away the stone. But when
[1:58:22] they got there, hallelujah, praise God,
[1:58:25] there were couple of couple of beings of
[1:58:27] light,
[1:58:29] shining like the sun who had already
[1:58:32] been there. Move the stone out of the
[1:58:34] way.
[1:58:36] Hallelujah. The body already gone.
[1:58:40] Mary's looking for him. And he walks up.
[1:58:43] He's already been to town and
[1:58:45] back. Read the story. He's already been
[1:58:49] to town and back. He's been checking on
[1:58:51] things. I'm ahead of myself.
[1:58:56] I love
[1:58:57] it. He's faithful.
[1:59:01] We don't keep first fruits. We're
[1:59:03] celebrating Jesus, our Messiah. He's the
[1:59:06] first fruits. We're seeing his
[1:59:08] resurrection power through the spirit
[1:59:11] right now. Nathan stood right here this
[1:59:13] morning and prayed, "Lord, I thank you
[1:59:15] that you are changing me." Amen.
[1:59:18] Somebody said that's a bold statement.
[1:59:20] It's a right statement. If you believe
[1:59:22] what the Bible said, you are being
[1:59:25] changed from strength to strength, from
[1:59:27] faith to faith, from glory to glory. We
[1:59:31] ought to testify that we realize God's
[1:59:33] working in us. Amen. Brother Brandham
[1:59:36] tells us that we should find Christ in
[1:59:39] every type, in every shadow, and even on
[1:59:44] every page of God's written word. And
[1:59:47] I'm determined to do that as long as I
[1:59:50] have strength to do so. Are you with me?
[1:59:53] Good. It's not one yet.
[1:59:57] In the message
[1:59:58] perseverant paragraph 13 now we believe
[2:00:01] the Bible to be God's
[2:00:04] infallible word we believe that it is
[2:00:07] the entire revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:00:15] So anything after the Bible can only be
[2:00:20] further
[2:00:21] understanding of what has already been
[2:00:24] said
[2:00:26] in the Bible because the Bible is the
[2:00:30] entire revelation of Jesus Christ. I I
[2:00:34] thought only the book of revelation was
[2:00:35] the revel No. Genesis, Exodus,
[2:00:38] Leviticus, Deuteronomy, N all the way
[2:00:40] through the entire Bible, the revelation
[2:00:43] of Jesus Christ revealing himself in the
[2:00:45] Old Testament. Say amen. Amen. Say it
[2:00:48] again, please. By the prophets, God
[2:00:50] making himself known through his son
[2:00:53] Christ Jesus. And in him dwelt the
[2:00:57] fullness of the Godhead bodily. He was
[2:01:00] the only person in the Godhead. Can you
[2:01:02] say amen? He was crucified for our sins,
[2:01:05] died, buried, rose the third day,
[2:01:07] ascended into heaven, and is back here
[2:01:10] again in the form of the Holy Spirit.
[2:01:13] God dwelling, one time God above us in
[2:01:16] Christ, God with us, and now
[2:01:22] that is so rich. That is one rich
[2:01:25] paragraph. That's one you ought to read
[2:01:28] again. It's God. This is It gets even a
[2:01:32] little richer. It gets a little richer.
[2:01:35] And it's God working his
[2:01:40] way the rest of the paragraph. It's God
[2:01:44] working his way back into
[2:01:49] man. That's what it was from the
[2:01:52] beginning. God finding a way to get back
[2:01:56] into man.
[2:01:58] I'm glad I'm a part of that plan. I
[2:02:01] wished you were here. I hope you're
[2:02:03] here. I pray you're here to be
[2:02:06] worshiped through man. Yes.
[2:02:10] God's
[2:02:12] agency. What's God's
[2:02:14] agency? Man. God wanted to work in man.
[2:02:18] He wanted to work through man because
[2:02:21] man is God's agency. God does nothing
[2:02:24] outside of a man being his agent, his
[2:02:29] helper. Can you say amen to that? And
[2:02:32] that's a woman, too.
[2:02:34] Oh, yes. It'll be quiet.
[2:02:38] You know, if you believe what the
[2:02:39] prophet said, mother is the fifth
[2:02:42] gospel.
[2:02:45] Unless mother's a
[2:02:47] man. Sometimes it might have had to be
[2:02:49] that way. But unless mother's a man,
[2:02:52] that means that God's word can live in
[2:02:56] the heart of a woman.
[2:03:00] And God can use her for her family, for
[2:03:03] her neighbor,
[2:03:06] for her church sisters.
[2:03:08] Praise God.
[2:03:10] And then in the message awakening Jesus,
[2:03:12] we won't do a lot of these in
[2:03:14] tempe the end of that large paragraph it
[2:03:18] said it's the word that's God's program
[2:03:20] the complete someone say complete
[2:03:23] complete the complete revelation of what
[2:03:26] he was what he
[2:03:29] is and what he will be
[2:03:34] this is a this is 63
[2:03:38] this is a good
[2:03:39] It's a continual revelation of Jesus
[2:03:47] Christ and a
[2:03:49] complete revelation of Jesus
[2:03:54] Christ. Is
[2:03:57] this Bible?
[2:03:59] Bible.
[2:04:02] Bible.
[2:04:03] We're not trying to take away from the
[2:04:06] message, but we are I am absolutely
[2:04:10] trying to tell you that the Bible
[2:04:13] presents the revelation of Jesus Christ
[2:04:15] in its entirety and it and it alone
[2:04:20] becomes the absolute.
[2:04:23] It's the only way it can be. You can't
[2:04:26] keep reissuing absolutes
[2:04:30] because then you don't know what to pick
[2:04:32] up and what to lay down. So God has
[2:04:35] given us an absolute and upon that
[2:04:38] absolute he gives greater understanding,
[2:04:40] greater revelation.
[2:04:43] But if you believe what the messenger
[2:04:45] said, you believe that when that seventh
[2:04:47] angel comes and the messenger is chosen
[2:04:50] to speak on his behalf, he will not have
[2:04:54] some message that is to be identified
[2:04:56] with him or his name.
[2:05:01] He said in fact he will have no message
[2:05:03] of his own.
[2:05:06] It will be his responsibility to take
[2:05:09] the loose ends
[2:05:11] of all the other messengers in ages and
[2:05:15] weave them
[2:05:16] together. It's already there. It's
[2:05:19] already written. But man's doctrine has
[2:05:22] divided it and we misunderstood it. And
[2:05:26] so we needed a weaver.
[2:05:30] We needed a tishbite
[2:05:33] under the anointing of an Elijah who
[2:05:35] would come. Not the Elijah, but a but
[2:05:38] the anointing, the spirit and power of a
[2:05:41] of an Elijah, of a Tishbite, who would
[2:05:44] weave together these loose ends from all
[2:05:47] the other ages like the second person of
[2:05:50] the Trinity and all these other
[2:05:52] outlandish like Easter Sunday and all
[2:05:55] these other outlandish things that that
[2:05:57] are not found anywhere in the entirety
[2:05:59] of scripture from Genesis to Revelation.
[2:06:02] We needed someone. He said, "I have come
[2:06:04] to separate paganism from Christianity."
[2:06:10] That's a pretty big responsibility right
[2:06:12] there.
[2:06:14] Too bad he's not
[2:06:16] here to do it in his churches
[2:06:20] today because they're no longer
[2:06:22] separated. The the Christianity and the
[2:06:24] paganism has run back together right
[2:06:27] here at the last days. There has to be a
[2:06:29] final sweep now. God has to raise up a
[2:06:32] people who won't bend or bow. Hello. Who
[2:06:36] won't bend or bow.
[2:06:38] Some Mach, some Shadrach, some Abednego
[2:06:42] somewhere who will say, "I love him too
[2:06:45] much to bow my knee to him. I can't
[2:06:49] worship him. He's my brother."
[2:06:53] Then off to the fiery furnace. Believe
[2:06:55] me, I can testify that's where you land.
[2:07:00] If you won't bow to the image of the
[2:07:02] prophet, you'll find yourself in the
[2:07:04] furnace and the and the and the uh
[2:07:07] clicks will turn up the heat 15, 20, 30
[2:07:12] times hotter. But that's okay because
[2:07:14] there's always going to be a people
[2:07:16] somewhere, a holy remnant that say, "I
[2:07:18] don't care what the trend is. I love him
[2:07:21] too much to call him Lord. I love him
[2:07:24] too much to call him the absolute. I
[2:07:26] love him too much to make everything he
[2:07:29] said thus sayaith the Lord when I know
[2:07:31] that if that were the case he
[2:07:32] contradicted himself and God never
[2:07:34] contradicts himself. I'm going to honor
[2:07:36] and respect and thank God for the gift
[2:07:39] but I'm only going to bow to Jesus
[2:07:41] Christ. That's just what the apostles
[2:07:43] said.
[2:07:45] And it worked for them because standing
[2:07:48] in the midst of the fiery furnace, I
[2:07:51] don't know who this dude is, the king
[2:07:54] said. But if I had to guess, I see one
[2:07:58] down there who is walking around, not
[2:08:02] three. Didn't we? Didn't we throw three
[2:08:04] men into the furnace? That's right. Oh,
[2:08:07] king. You know it's true. He said,
[2:08:09] "Well, then what is this I see? There
[2:08:11] are four men and they're no longer
[2:08:14] bound. They're walking all around. And
[2:08:18] this pagan, heathen,
[2:08:21] ungodly king said, "And the fourth man
[2:08:25] is like unto the son of God." Who told
[2:08:30] that filthy king that God had a son?
[2:08:37] It must have come by a moment of
[2:08:39] inspiration.
[2:08:41] A moment of revelation.
[2:08:43] So we read just a moment ago Leviticus
[2:08:46] 23:10-11. You shall bring a sheath of
[2:08:48] the first fruits of your harvest unto
[2:08:50] the priest and he shall wave the sheath
[2:08:53] before the Lord to be accepted for you.
[2:08:57] Number one, the first
[2:09:00] sheath. It represents Jesus who is the
[2:09:04] first to rise. The first fruits sheath
[2:09:08] was cut at the end of the Sabbath,
[2:09:10] Nissan 17, which would be early morning
[2:09:13] Sunday. It was barley. It was the
[2:09:16] initial harvest. It was the first to
[2:09:18] ripen. It was inspected for acceptance.
[2:09:20] It was ordered to God as a pledge of
[2:09:23] more to come. In Genesis 37:7, I'm not
[2:09:27] going to read it, but in Genesis 37:7,
[2:09:30] we learn that prophetically a sheath can
[2:09:34] already represent a person. How many of
[2:09:37] you remember the dream of of uh of of
[2:09:40] that of the time of Joseph? And do you
[2:09:43] remember that in that dream uh the the
[2:09:46] brother sheaves were bowing down
[2:09:50] to to to his
[2:09:52] sheath persons giving obesence to one
[2:09:56] who had risen to the top. The cream had
[2:10:00] risen to the top of the milk. And so the
[2:10:03] sheath although it is a bundle of grain
[2:10:06] it can represent even a person or a
[2:10:09] ministry in scripture. The Bible calls
[2:10:12] Jesus the firstborn son. Look at Isaiah
[2:10:16] 42:1. Behold my servant whom I uphold,
[2:10:19] mine elect, in whom my soul delightth. I
[2:10:22] have put my spirit upon him. He shall
[2:10:25] bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He
[2:10:28] shall not cry nor lift up nor cause his
[2:10:30] voice to be heard in the street. A
[2:10:32] bruised reed. He shall not break in the
[2:10:35] smoking flax shall he not quench. He
[2:10:38] shall bring forth judgment unto truth.
[2:10:40] He shall not fail nor be discouraged
[2:10:43] till he hath set judgment in the earth
[2:10:45] and the isles shall wait for his law.
[2:10:48] Thus saith the God the Lord. He that
[2:10:51] created the heavens and stretched them
[2:10:53] out. He that spread forth the earth and
[2:10:55] that which cometh out of it. He that
[2:10:57] giveth breath unto the people upon it
[2:10:59] and spirit to them that walk therein. If
[2:11:02] you read that, wouldn't you think that
[2:11:04] God's got everything under control?
[2:11:06] Got everything under control. So, he was
[2:11:09] not the only son to rise, but he was the
[2:11:12] first son, the perfect son, the chosen
[2:11:15] son. Look at Romans 8:29. Let's go
[2:11:18] quickly. I know you're
[2:11:20] ready. For whom he did forno, he also
[2:11:25] did to be conformed to the image of his
[2:11:30] son, the first fruits of them which
[2:11:33] slept, that he might be the firstborn.
[2:11:40] Not the only
[2:11:41] son, the first son. Look at it in the
[2:11:44] amplified. For those whom he forneew of
[2:11:48] whom he was aware and loved
[2:11:51] beforehand, he also destined from the
[2:11:54] beginning. for ordaining them to be
[2:11:58] molded into the image of his son and
[2:12:02] share
[2:12:04] inwardly his likeness that he might
[2:12:08] become the firstborn among many
[2:12:11] brethren. My God, that's why I remember
[2:12:14] the feast of first fruits. That's why I
[2:12:16] celebrate that instead of Ishtar.
[2:12:20] I celebrate the feast of first fruits
[2:12:22] because because he raised I can raise
[2:12:25] Because he came to maturity, I can come
[2:12:27] to maturity. Because he beat the su, I
[2:12:31] can beat the su n. I don't have to fall
[2:12:35] victim to Roman
[2:12:38] religion, I can stay clean. If you
[2:12:42] understand that, say, amen. It's got to
[2:12:44] be your best. Numbers 18:12. All the
[2:12:47] best of the oil, the best of the wine
[2:12:49] and of the wheat, the first fruits of
[2:12:51] them which they shall offer unto the
[2:12:52] Lord, them have I given thee. the first
[2:12:54] fruits is not uh the
[2:12:57] first that uh you know is not
[2:13:04] good. So if you're giving God the first
[2:13:07] lamb, you're not giving God the crippled
[2:13:09] lamb. You're waiting on another one. I
[2:13:13] mean, I'm just saying what the scripture
[2:13:14] says. If you're bringing God the barley,
[2:13:17] the first barley, you're not bringing
[2:13:18] him worming barley, you're not bringing
[2:13:20] him molded barley, even though it was
[2:13:22] the first to come to
[2:13:24] maturity, the scripture is clear. It's
[2:13:26] to be the best of the oil, the best of
[2:13:28] the wine, the best of the wheat. That's
[2:13:29] why I say even your tithe should come
[2:13:32] from the entire amount because you're
[2:13:34] giving God from the beginning what he
[2:13:36] has blessed you.
[2:13:38] Best oil, best wine, best olives, the
[2:13:41] first fruits of them which they shall
[2:13:42] offer unto the Lord. them have I given
[2:13:47] thee. That's a prophetic statement
[2:13:50] concerning what God's looking for in our
[2:13:52] first fruits. And then look at John
[2:13:54] 3:16. If you don't know this, where have
[2:13:56] you been all your life? For God so loved
[2:13:59] the world that he gave his only begotten
[2:14:02] son that whosoever believeth in him
[2:14:04] should not perish but have everlasting
[2:14:06] life. What did God do? He cared
[2:14:09] enough not to send his very best. He
[2:14:13] cared enough to come and be the very
[2:14:16] best son that the world had ever known.
[2:14:20] If you're giving God the best oil, the
[2:14:22] best wine, the best of the wheat, the
[2:14:23] best of the barley, the best of the
[2:14:25] pomegranate, the best the best olive,
[2:14:28] the best date, the best honey, the best
[2:14:32] almond, then then God said, I'm going to
[2:14:34] match the first fruits and I if he's
[2:14:36] going to fulfill if the resurrection of
[2:14:38] of my son is going to fulfill the feast
[2:14:41] of first fruits, I'm going to send the
[2:14:43] very best I
[2:14:44] have. I want you to remember this. Jesus
[2:14:47] was the first son to come to maturity,
[2:14:49] not the last son, not the only son. Are
[2:14:52] you Are you okay with me reading a
[2:14:54] little more? Good. I'm glad because it's
[2:14:56] not time to stop just yet. If you need
[2:14:59] to slip out, if you've got some big uh
[2:15:01] Easter buffet waiting on you somewhere
[2:15:05] uh and you need to slip out, I totally
[2:15:07] understand. But I'm not done just yet.
[2:15:10] In the message, it is the rising of the
[2:15:12] sun.
[2:15:15] in paragraph 83. I like to look at this.
[2:15:17] This is powerful. If you've never heard
[2:15:19] this sermon, you should hear it before
[2:15:21] you go to bed tonight. In fact, it's one
[2:15:23] of the most powerful sermons on the
[2:15:25] resurrection and what God's purpose in
[2:15:27] his bride is for the last days that
[2:15:29] you've ever heard. It's powerful. I
[2:15:32] preached it the last time I was in
[2:15:34] Ghana. And I'm telling you, the
[2:15:36] building, the roof of the building
[2:15:37] nearly
[2:15:39] lifted on what would have been called
[2:15:41] Easter Sunday. The building nearly
[2:15:42] shook. It was so powerful. The people so
[2:15:46] blessed to hear these words. Listen to
[2:15:48] them for a moment. He said, "If there
[2:15:49] would be any holy ritual, it should come
[2:15:52] forth on the Sabbath day," which was the
[2:15:54] seventh day of the week, which is
[2:15:56] Saturday. What day did Brother Brandham
[2:15:58] say the Sabbath was in the scripture?
[2:16:00] Saturday. So, back
[2:16:02] off. But did you notice in this
[2:16:04] memorial, he wasn't to wave it on the
[2:16:07] Sabbath? He was to wave it on the first
[2:16:10] day of the week. That was the Sunday
[2:16:14] paragraph 84. The sheath. You know what
[2:16:17] a sheath is, don't you? You know, you
[2:16:19] see these
[2:16:21] at Never
[2:16:26] mind. I just had images of
[2:16:30] jacko'lanterns
[2:16:34] and even the sheath is
[2:16:38] hijacked or harvest festivals.
[2:16:41] These message churches will go all out
[2:16:43] and have these big harvest
[2:16:46] festivals. If they hear that somebody's
[2:16:49] preaching on first fruits or Passover,
[2:16:52] they spin around like some kind of dime,
[2:16:56] dizzy
[2:16:57] dime while they uh will adopt these
[2:17:00] other festivals to celebrate and party
[2:17:03] and have good times and reject the feast
[2:17:05] of the Lord and make fun of those who
[2:17:07] would even mention them by name.
[2:17:09] Something is seriously wrong. I thought
[2:17:13] paganism was to be separated from
[2:17:15] Christianity.
[2:17:19] The
[2:17:20] sheath which was
[2:17:22] the first of your seed that you planted
[2:17:25] when it comes up and ripened. You cut
[2:17:28] down the sheath. You take it to the
[2:17:30] priest. You let him take it and wave it
[2:17:33] before the Lord for your acception that
[2:17:36] you are accepted. You have come with
[2:17:38] your sheath and he is to wave it before
[2:17:40] the Lord. Aren't you thankful that you
[2:17:42] don't have to come and bring your sheath
[2:17:44] to your priest.
[2:17:46] You don't have to come and bring the
[2:17:47] sheath to your prophet, to your pastor,
[2:17:49] to your evangelist. You can bring your
[2:17:52] own sheath now. And you can wave it
[2:17:55] before the Lord in worship. That's what
[2:17:58] you're doing. When you come to God's
[2:18:00] house and give him more,
[2:18:04] some some people aren't even made to do
[2:18:06] such a thing. They're they're they're
[2:18:08] so, you know, created so
[2:18:11] docile, so
[2:18:13] dignified that if if they break forth to
[2:18:16] do that, you can say, "My, they're
[2:18:18] really coming out of their mold." You
[2:18:21] should come out of your mold. You should
[2:18:22] come out of your shell. You should thank
[2:18:25] God. You don't have to find a priest
[2:18:26] somewhere to give your offering to the
[2:18:28] Lord. You can give it to him. You don't
[2:18:30] even have to wait till you get to
[2:18:31] church. You can praise him on the way.
[2:18:34] Please keep one hand on the steering
[2:18:36] wheel at all times.
[2:18:38] But we have gi been given this great
[2:18:40] grace to give God an offering all the
[2:18:43] time. Every day, every day of the week,
[2:18:47] no matter what the time is, you're still
[2:18:50] here.
[2:18:52] Let him take it and wave it before the
[2:18:53] Lord. Not on the Sabbath, but the
[2:18:56] seventh day.
[2:18:58] on the fir which is the Sabbath seventh
[2:19:00] day but on the first day which we call
[2:19:03] Sunday s u n d a y and remember it has
[2:19:08] been so named to remember the oh let me
[2:19:12] just let brother Brandham say it excuse
[2:19:13] me of course that's a Roman word which
[2:19:16] they called it the Sunday for
[2:19:24] the so we're going to get up very early
[2:19:27] on Sunday and we're going to have a
[2:19:29] sunrise
[2:19:31] service and we're going to turn our
[2:19:33] faces toward the sun su n when the s o n
[2:19:38] is the one who has risen and he can get
[2:19:40] up at 11 o'clock when you come to
[2:19:44] church. You didn't have to lose sleep to
[2:19:46] come and worship him today. Didn't you
[2:19:49] all used to do that, brother Shelley?
[2:19:50] Absolutely we did. We wanted to be right
[2:19:53] in every way, but we certainly didn't
[2:19:55] wait till it was daylight to do it.
[2:19:58] We came when it was dark. We came some
[2:20:00] years when it was so cold my teeth were
[2:20:02] rattling in my
[2:20:04] head. I loved every moment of it, every
[2:20:07] second of it. I love the fact that it
[2:20:09] interrupted
[2:20:11] life. I did. Those were the days where
[2:20:15] we would go to church. We'd spend couple
[2:20:17] hours out
[2:20:19] here. We'd go to Hardies for a biscuit.
[2:20:23] We'd go to church in Columbus and stay
[2:20:25] about 5 hours. We'd eat lunch together
[2:20:28] in the fellowship hall, come back that
[2:20:29] night and have about another five hours.
[2:20:32] Don't talk to me about having your life
[2:20:34] interrupted.
[2:20:35] I know what it's all about. So when I
[2:20:38] read and I began to understand that
[2:20:40] that's not something that I had to do,
[2:20:41] needed to do, or the Lord wanted me to
[2:20:43] do, I just marked it off.
[2:20:47] It was a hard hard decision because one
[2:20:49] of the brothers who was worshiping with
[2:20:51] us at the time, he really met the Lord
[2:20:53] on one of those services. I said, "You
[2:20:55] don't ever have to forget that. You can
[2:20:57] testify to it. We were doing all we knew
[2:21:00] to do. It's not to condemn others. We're
[2:21:02] not doing it." No, no, no. Just be glad
[2:21:04] that God met you. But the same God that
[2:21:06] met you there could have met you
[2:21:07] anywhere. If you belong to him, he's
[2:21:10] going to find you. He said it's not the
[2:21:12] su anymore. It's the s day.
[2:21:18] So, we're coming on the s day. Today is
[2:21:20] Sunday. S O N that the corn of wheat,
[2:21:25] God's first one up from the dead, it
[2:21:27] would be barley at this time of year,
[2:21:29] doesn't matter, is to be waved over the
[2:21:33] congregation that we are.
[2:21:36] Say that one more time. Doesn't that
[2:21:38] have a lovely ring to it? And that's the
[2:21:41] first of the seed of those that slept
[2:21:43] waved upon the first day of the week.
[2:21:48] He's driving that home, isn't he? Yes.
[2:21:52] On Sunday, he raised up, waved
[2:21:56] goodbye, and ascended up on high in the
[2:22:01] presence of the people. Why stand ye
[2:22:04] here gazing? Isn't that what they said?
[2:22:07] This same Jesus, somebody thinks that'll
[2:22:09] preach, don't you? This same Jesus that
[2:22:12] you see taken from your side, don't you
[2:22:16] worry, in like manner will return.
[2:22:20] Do you believe that still that the same
[2:22:23] Jesus who resurrected at first fruits
[2:22:26] and ascended into the heavenlies will
[2:22:29] return again to the same place?
[2:22:34] Zechariah tells us he's coming right
[2:22:36] back to the same place in the second
[2:22:38] coming. His feet will touch down on the
[2:22:40] Mount of Olives. One half of the
[2:22:42] mountain goes that way. One half of the
[2:22:44] mountain goes that way. Jesus left here
[2:22:46] with an earthquake. He comes back with
[2:22:47] an earthquake.
[2:22:51] Powerful, isn't it? I got to go on. I'm
[2:22:54] having so much fun.
[2:22:58] Now, notice it was the first corn of
[2:23:00] God's wheat that had been raised from
[2:23:01] the dead. God's first corn of wheat. And
[2:23:03] he's saying corn in the sense of the
[2:23:05] kernel of life, the seed, the kernel of
[2:23:08] the seed. By God's quickening power, God
[2:23:10] had quickened his life, raised him up
[2:23:12] from the dead, and he was
[2:23:15] the first. Don't you let them hear you
[2:23:19] using that term, first fruits. They'll
[2:23:21] think you're trying to be a
[2:23:23] Jew. First fruits of those that slept,
[2:23:27] the first fruit. He was
[2:23:31] the chief. He was the chief chief,
[2:23:35] wasn't he? He said, "Notice it was the
[2:23:37] first corn of God's wheat." Verse 89,
[2:23:40] uh, excuse me, paragraph 89. Now, that's
[2:23:43] why they had to wave that sheath for it
[2:23:46] was the first one that come to maturity.
[2:23:48] It was waved as a memorial of
[2:23:50] thanksgiving to God, believing, hear
[2:23:52] this, hear this, believing that the rest
[2:23:54] of them would come. It was
[2:23:57] a and today because he was the first son
[2:24:00] of God s o n to come to full maturity to
[2:24:02] be in God. He was plucked up from the
[2:24:04] earth waved over the people. Oh, what a
[2:24:07] glorious lesson by the quickening power.
[2:24:10] The first one although he had been
[2:24:13] typed and many times as we'll see later
[2:24:17] typed but this was really the first
[2:24:20] fruit of them that slept he was waved
[2:24:23] over. Hallelujah. Forgive me. Forgive
[2:24:25] me. Praise God. He was waved over the
[2:24:29] promised
[2:24:31] seed that had promise of life.
[2:24:36] Woo. And all the little seed can look up
[2:24:39] and say, "Hey,
[2:24:43] somebody said, are you crazy?" No. The
[2:24:45] scripture talks about it, doesn't it?
[2:24:47] Reigns on just and unjust.
[2:24:49] Brother Brandham had that experience.
[2:24:51] the little the little seed the the real
[2:24:53] the real grain lifted up its hand.
[2:24:55] Praise the Lord. And so did the the
[2:24:57] false seed, the shuck, the rest of it.
[2:24:59] Uh the tears. I'm coming to it in a
[2:25:01] minute. They all thank God for the rain.
[2:25:04] I'm thankful. I'm so thankful. Well, I
[2:25:06] can just lift up my hand in my head and
[2:25:08] I can say if the if the Jesus Christ,
[2:25:11] the first s o n came to maturity, the
[2:25:13] same God, the same spirit that brought
[2:25:15] him to maturity is the same God, the
[2:25:18] same spirit that I'm depending on to
[2:25:20] bring me to maturity, did not the
[2:25:22] scripture say, if that same spirit that
[2:25:27] raised Jesus from the dead shall also
[2:25:31] quicken your mortal body, it'll do the
[2:25:34] same for knew
[2:25:36] that it did for him. Yes. Hallelujah. He
[2:25:39] was waved over the promised seed that
[2:25:41] had promise of life. Paragraph 91.
[2:25:44] Sorry, I just see that I didn't separate
[2:25:46] the paragraph. He was waved at the day
[2:25:48] of Pentecost when there came a sound
[2:25:50] from heaven like a waving mighty rushing
[2:25:52] wind and was waved over the people, the
[2:25:54] Pentecostal people that was up at
[2:25:55] Pentecost waiting for the blessing to
[2:25:57] come. Now, he's talking about the same
[2:26:00] concept of first fruits. This happens 50
[2:26:03] days later at Shàuote, but the concept
[2:26:07] of the first fruits is the same. The
[2:26:10] concept is exactly the same. And when
[2:26:12] he's preaching on first fruits, he goes
[2:26:14] back and forth between the feast. If
[2:26:16] that upsets anybody, I'm so sorry. What
[2:26:19] can I say? He was a
[2:26:22] man. He was a
[2:26:24] human. He was a human. He was not
[2:26:26] infallible. He was fallible like all of
[2:26:30] us.
[2:26:31] The whole concept that God has to use a
[2:26:34] perfect prophet is is absolutely
[2:26:37] ridiculous
[2:26:38] because he didn't even have perfect
[2:26:40] disciples.
[2:26:42] How could he have No, no, no. He uses
[2:26:44] the broken. He uses the cracked pots. He
[2:26:47] uses those who don't even have an eighth
[2:26:49] grade uh uh uh grammar school education.
[2:26:53] He uses those who will say yes. So, if
[2:26:56] he somehow grabs the wrong feast, is
[2:26:58] that going to throw you for a loop? I
[2:27:01] don't think so. Are you going to throw
[2:27:02] the baby out because the bathwater got
[2:27:04] dirty? I don't think
[2:27:10] so. He was waved over the promised seed,
[2:27:14] this Pentecostal bless. He said, "And to
[2:27:16] be waved again, we realize in the last
[2:27:18] day according to Luke
[2:27:20] 17:30, in the sen day again, in the day
[2:27:24] of the Sen, son of man, when he will be
[2:27:28] revealed, waved again over the people."
[2:27:30] He's talking about another mature son
[2:27:36] who comes at the end
[2:27:38] time, not perfect in
[2:27:41] humanity, but
[2:27:44] matured in
[2:27:46] faith,
[2:27:48] obedient to the end. Thank God we've
[2:27:51] seen it. Yes. You can say amen. Amen. Or
[2:27:55] me.
[2:27:56] If all the teaching that we have, he
[2:27:59] said, "Now, who is the son of man? In
[2:28:01] the beginning was the word. The word was
[2:28:02] with God. The word was God." Please
[2:28:04] don't come and tell me that brother
[2:28:05] Brandon was the son of man. He was not
[2:28:07] the son of man. He could not have been
[2:28:09] the son of man. He was what all the
[2:28:11] other prophets are, a son of man who
[2:28:14] came to reveal the son of man. The son
[2:28:17] of man is Jesus ministering in a
[2:28:20] prophetic form. Not as savior but as a
[2:28:24] prophet. Remember, he comes in three
[2:28:27] entire different manifestations. Son of
[2:28:30] man, son of God, son of David.
[2:28:33] So, brother Brandham is not the son of
[2:28:36] man. My goodness, have you lost it? He
[2:28:39] was a son of man, which is a prophet. He
[2:28:42] tells us that, revealing the son of man,
[2:28:45] Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:28:48] So now we have a son of man coming to
[2:28:52] maturity because he has yielded his life
[2:28:56] to the son of man.
[2:28:58] How do you think you and I are going to
[2:29:00] come to maturity? Aren't we also sons
[2:29:02] and daughters of men? How are we going
[2:29:05] to ever come by yielding our life to the
[2:29:08] son of man? You may not know it. I don't
[2:29:10] say it uh too too often, but that's good
[2:29:13] preaching. I'll just tell you right now.
[2:29:15] I wish that we could find that balance
[2:29:17] and stay there. He said Luke 17th
[2:29:19] chapter 30th verse Malachi 4 different
[2:29:22] scriptures that we're acquainted with
[2:29:23] that word again the word again the word
[2:29:26] again the word again the word again the
[2:29:28] son of man is the word of God again in
[2:29:31] the form of a man that's what it is the
[2:29:34] people that the dead traditions of man
[2:29:37] is dead the son of God is alive again
[2:29:40] with the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:29:43] right among us and is giving us as
[2:29:47] Christ was was the first one to raise
[2:29:49] from all the prophets and so forth also
[2:29:51] typed in many places. He was the first
[2:29:53] fruits of those that slept in the bride
[2:29:57] coming of Christ. Hear it. In the bride
[2:30:00] coming of Christ coming out of the
[2:30:02] church, there'll have to
[2:30:05] be a sheath waved again in the last
[2:30:10] days.
[2:30:13] What does that say? We now have a
[2:30:16] perfect sheath so we can sit down and do
[2:30:20] nothing. No, it says my my my my,
[2:30:23] there's hope for me.
[2:30:25] Oh, if God can do it again in the end
[2:30:27] time and bring a people to perfection,
[2:30:29] if God can bring a prophet all the way
[2:30:31] through to maturity
[2:30:33] so that he has authority to speak the
[2:30:35] spoken word and watch God create what he
[2:30:38] speaks. Not so that we can stand in awe
[2:30:41] and talk about how great that is. But so
[2:30:43] that we can say if God did it for him,
[2:30:46] hallelujah. I could use a little spoken
[2:30:49] word manifestation in my own life. I've
[2:30:52] got a condition, an ailment, a this or
[2:30:54] that, a problem. I need this. I prevent,
[2:30:57] you know, we have needs.
[2:31:00] Recognize the wave sheath.
[2:31:04] Watch and see what God has done. And
[2:31:07] then believe with all your heart that if
[2:31:10] he did it one generation ago, he's the
[2:31:14] same yesterday, today, and forever, he
[2:31:17] can do it again.
[2:31:19] Even in our day, we've got to go
[2:31:23] home. My I feel good now.
[2:31:27] Waving of the sheath. Woo! Praise God.
[2:31:32] The first one that come to mature, the
[2:31:34] first one that proved it was a wheat,
[2:31:36] that proved it was a sheath. Hallelujah.
[2:31:39] He said, I'm sure you see what I'm
[2:31:40] talking about. Waved over the people.
[2:31:42] And the first time there will come forth
[2:31:44] for the bride age, for a resurrection
[2:31:46] out of dark
[2:31:49] denominationalism. So what do we do in
[2:31:51] the end time? We marvel back again at
[2:31:54] the denominations.
[2:31:56] We start patterning our services again
[2:31:59] just like the denominations. We start
[2:32:02] raising up programs and committees
[2:32:07] just like the
[2:32:09] denominations. We start adapting all of
[2:32:11] the mixed worship.
[2:32:15] Eggs on the altar, Christmas trees on
[2:32:18] the platform.
[2:32:21] No sir. We've been resurrected out of
[2:32:24] dark
[2:32:24] denominationalism. Somebody said,
[2:32:26] "Aren't you just condemning everybody
[2:32:27] else?" Listen, if preaching what is true
[2:32:31] causes someone else to look condemned,
[2:32:34] I'm not the judge here. I'm just going
[2:32:36] to say what the word says. He said we'll
[2:32:39] be a message. I thank God for it. That
[2:32:41] the full maturity of the word has turned
[2:32:44] back again in its full power and being
[2:32:46] waved over the people by the same signs
[2:32:48] and wonders that they did back there. It
[2:32:50] used to be something that we were
[2:32:52] looking for the finality and the
[2:32:53] consummation of it. We believed that God
[2:32:55] had done it in seed form in the ministry
[2:32:58] of brother Brandham. That's what
[2:32:59] everybody I knew 30 years ago believed.
[2:33:02] But as the years go by and people get
[2:33:04] tired of waiting, they started deciding
[2:33:06] all of a sudden. We already know
[2:33:08] everything we need to know about the
[2:33:10] seventh seal. We already know everything
[2:33:11] we need to know about the thunders. We
[2:33:13] already know everything. Why the
[2:33:15] prophet, he gave it all to us. We It's
[2:33:17] all finished. It's all done. And now
[2:33:19] we've got a problem. We're losing
[2:33:21] generations of kids back to the world.
[2:33:23] back to denomination. Now they're
[2:33:25] raising up a and accusing
[2:33:29] their own parents of being cults.
[2:33:31] [Music]
[2:33:33] Something is seriously wrong. If God did
[2:33:36] it, he can do it again. If God brings
[2:33:38] people back to the absolute one time, he
[2:33:41] can do it again. If God drops a plum
[2:33:43] line once,
[2:33:46] he can do it again. In fact, the prophet
[2:33:49] prophesied and told us that there is to
[2:33:51] be an installment of revelation that
[2:33:54] comes in every generation.
[2:33:58] No longer a one-man ministry. That's
[2:34:00] finished. No longer a messenger of an
[2:34:03] seventh angel. That's finished. But a
[2:34:07] generation, a Joshua generation
[2:34:10] with a draash
[2:34:14] with a double portion of Elijah's
[2:34:16] spirit. Amen. Who wait on the Lord, who
[2:34:20] understand the important I'm going to
[2:34:22] say this, who understand the importance
[2:34:24] of the bride's revival, who understand
[2:34:27] the importance of knowing exactly what
[2:34:30] was underneath those thunders when they
[2:34:32] sounded.
[2:34:36] And even though now they come back and
[2:34:38] tell us that was the virtues that were
[2:34:40] preached during the seals during which
[2:34:42] which he didn't preach the virtues in
[2:34:43] the seals, he preached the virtues in
[2:34:45] the church ages.
[2:34:47] But they come and tell us now that's
[2:34:49] what was in the thunder every time a
[2:34:51] message came forth that had to be what
[2:34:53] what was in the Then why is it at the
[2:34:55] end of the church ages and at the end of
[2:34:58] the seals? He's still saying we don't
[2:35:01] know it yet. We have we don't see it
[2:35:04] yet. It hasn't come to us yet.
[2:35:17] And the first time there'll come forth
[2:35:18] for that bride will be a message that
[2:35:20] the full mater go on go on go on go on
[2:35:23] by the same signs and wonders that he
[2:35:25] did back there. Because I lived, ye also
[2:35:28] live. Speaking to his wife, bridegroom
[2:35:31] to bride. Because I live, you also live.
[2:35:34] I'm hurrying. What a resurrection that
[2:35:36] was. And what a resurrection this is. to
[2:35:40] be quickened from the dead, to be made
[2:35:42] alive in Christ Jesus by God's
[2:35:44] quickening power. He was waved to them.
[2:35:47] The word which he was was waved back to
[2:35:50] them on the day of Pentecost. The word
[2:35:52] made manifest. Now, as I say, it's to be
[2:35:55] waved again.
[2:35:59] I'm just going to I'm just I'm going to
[2:36:01] stop on point 2345. I'll do it another
[2:36:03] time, but I'm going to finish this
[2:36:06] quotation. I'm going to skip to 107 when
[2:36:09] I'm done. The musicians are
[2:36:13] coming. We may be the only church in the
[2:36:16] country that has less people
[2:36:21] on egg
[2:36:25] Sunday. Youth people, young people going
[2:36:27] to camp, etc., etc.,
[2:36:32] etc. Sort of always been that way.
[2:36:36] If you can't give them what they
[2:36:39] want, if there's no Easter lilies on the
[2:36:42] altar
[2:36:46] and you see it's not Jesus folks are
[2:36:50] attracted to, it's the warm and fuzzies.
[2:36:52] That's right.
[2:36:54] People could care less that it at the
[2:36:57] end of the year supposed to be his
[2:36:58] birthday. They could care less. That's
[2:37:00] not what they're coming together. You
[2:37:02] know that
[2:37:03] they're coming together for the warm and
[2:37:05] fuzzies. If you'd come to Jesus, get
[2:37:07] full of the Holy Ghost, you can have
[2:37:08] warm and fuzzies every time you meet in
[2:37:10] his presence.
[2:37:13] If there's no Easter lilies, if there's
[2:37:15] no decorated cross, if there's no this,
[2:37:18] that, or the other, what's the use in
[2:37:20] even making the extra
[2:37:23] effort? Because Jesus is alive and he's
[2:37:27] going to be alive next Sunday and next
[2:37:29] Sunday and and tomorrow. Hallelujah.
[2:37:32] Glory be to God.
[2:37:36] The S so o day is
[2:37:39] here. Paragraph 107. He said, is that
[2:37:42] right? Did I? Yeah. There was the first
[2:37:44] chief. This is just
[2:37:47] about 20 minutes of the sermon. I'm
[2:37:49] sorry, but I I I added this this
[2:37:52] morning. I'm sitting at the dining room
[2:37:54] table. I'm up at 6:30. I'm I've already
[2:37:57] had a shower. I've already uh put my
[2:38:00] toupe on. I've already done everything
[2:38:02] that I'm going to do for the service.
[2:38:05] except except my church clothes. I'm
[2:38:07] still in I put my pajamas back on and
[2:38:10] I'm sitting at the dining room table and
[2:38:12] I'm thinking, "How in the world will I
[2:38:15] get all this in? I need three services,
[2:38:19] not one." And here I felt the quickening
[2:38:22] come on these quotations. I'm trying to
[2:38:25] trim them down. And here I'm adding
[2:38:26] another dozen. I just can't help myself.
[2:38:30] There was the first chief come up from
[2:38:32] all the prophets which was the son of
[2:38:34] God the king of all prophets. There has
[2:38:36] been churches, churches, brides, brides,
[2:38:40] churches, brides,
[2:38:42] brides. You get
[2:38:47] it? Those poor little
[2:38:51] women stripped of
[2:38:55] their street
[2:38:58] clothes, placed in
[2:39:00] bridal
[2:39:03] robes, a wedding band placed on their
[2:39:06] hand, mostly usually young virgin girls
[2:39:09] never been
[2:39:10] married as part of initiations into
[2:39:14] certain orders of nuns laid in a
[2:39:18] coffin. If you believe the testimony of
[2:39:21] Sister Charlotte, and I do, by the way,
[2:39:24] Josiah, there's you a
[2:39:27] Charlotte. God saved her life out of the
[2:39:31] Roman Catholic
[2:39:33] Church. She laid all night. Excuse
[2:39:40] me. She laid all
[2:39:43] night. It's a symbol in the Catholicism
[2:39:46] of being dead to the world. She lays all
[2:39:50] night in a
[2:39:52] coffin. In some cases, we're told the
[2:39:55] lid shut. I'm telling you that would be
[2:39:57] the end of my religious
[2:40:00] commitment. If you think I'm going to
[2:40:03] lay all night with the lid of a casket
[2:40:06] closed, I had better not know it when
[2:40:09] you close
[2:40:10] it. You hear
[2:40:13] me? Or you're going to have a video to
[2:40:16] show on Facebook for eternity cuz I am
[2:40:18] coming out of
[2:40:20] there. I cannot
[2:40:24] imagine. And she lay there giving her
[2:40:27] life to this
[2:40:30] order, whipped at Easter,
[2:40:37] flagagillated. The mother's superior is
[2:40:40] chosen
[2:40:41] to in certain orders of the nuns to to
[2:40:45] whip them because they are suffering for
[2:40:48] Christ. Somebody said, "Does that go
[2:40:50] on?" It goes on in Central America right
[2:40:52] now. It goes on in Mexico. It goes on in
[2:40:55] South America. There probably places in
[2:40:57] America where it goes on that every Good
[2:40:59] Friday, good Catholics are flagagillated
[2:41:04] to represent their commitment and
[2:41:06] suffering for Christ.
[2:41:10] Can you imagine such a thing? Bleeding,
[2:41:14] broken, and she is so bound. She is so
[2:41:18] brainwashed. She is so deceived.
[2:41:24] She hides the
[2:41:29] secrets. In the 80s, I was in Puerto
[2:41:31] Rico preaching and they took us to where
[2:41:35] a resort was being built in San
[2:41:38] Juan and it was being built over a place
[2:41:41] where a monastery and a nunnery had been
[2:41:45] for many, many, many years.
[2:41:48] They're digging the swimming
[2:41:50] pool and lo and behold, what do they
[2:41:53] find? Hundreds of babies
[2:41:57] bones. Full skeletons of small
[2:42:03] babies. Dozens and dozens of them hid in
[2:42:08] the earth
[2:42:11] underneath. And a
[2:42:13] Catholic
[2:42:15] guide hung his head when I asked, "What
[2:42:20] is
[2:42:22] that?" Because there were little crosses
[2:42:24] put in
[2:42:26] rows where the swimming pool was going
[2:42:28] to be eventually. And he hung his head
[2:42:32] as a Roman Catholic guide. And he said,
[2:42:33] "I'm sorry to tell you, there were
[2:42:35] dozens of little baby bones found
[2:42:38] there." I said, "Where did those babies
[2:42:40] come from? How could there have been
[2:42:42] that many babies die in a in a monastery
[2:42:45] where celibate priests live and a and a
[2:42:48] nunnery where celibate nuns live? And he
[2:42:52] said, I can I can tell you or leave it
[2:42:54] to your imagination. I said, I've
[2:42:56] already got an imagination. Now tell me
[2:42:58] what it means. He said they were the
[2:43:00] product of of illicit relationships that
[2:43:03] took place between the priest and the
[2:43:07] nuns. And the little babies, some of
[2:43:10] them born fullterm,
[2:43:13] suffocated to hide, to cover the lies of
[2:43:17] religion. And you want to get your nose
[2:43:20] bent out of shape a little bit. If I
[2:43:22] preach a little hard, then we've got to
[2:43:24] know what we believe and stand on truth.
[2:43:26] Is anybody with me? Come on.
[2:43:29] There is a real, there is a genuine,
[2:43:31] there is an apostolic faith that's worth
[2:43:34] dying for. And it ain't that mess.
[2:43:36] That's right.
[2:43:38] Oh, that's rough. You are so mean.
[2:43:41] Forgive me. I I'm just mean by nature, I
[2:43:45] guess, without his help. He said, "But
[2:43:48] there has to come one." Why'd you say
[2:43:49] all that? Cuz brother Bam said, "Bride,
[2:43:51] bride, bride." Because the she said we
[2:43:54] were doing that because we were told
[2:43:56] that if we followed through, if we slept
[2:43:58] on this board instead of a mattress, if
[2:44:00] we lay all night like that, if we did
[2:44:03] this, that or the other, we would become
[2:44:05] the brides of
[2:44:10] Christ. And here's a room full of people
[2:44:13] who who believe claim right here today
[2:44:16] that they are the bride of Christ. and
[2:44:18] they've not had to sleep one night on a
[2:44:20] hard wood board perhaps or lay all night
[2:44:22] in a coffin with a wedding band on your
[2:44:25] hand for someone to all of a sudden tell
[2:44:27] you you're the bride of Christ. Aren't
[2:44:28] you glad that he paid the price with his
[2:44:31] own blood? Aren't you glad that he
[2:44:33] redeemed us and saved us, justified us,
[2:44:36] sanctified us, filled us with his life,
[2:44:40] called us his own and we didn't have to
[2:44:42] go, we didn't have to quote the Apostles
[2:44:44] Creed, and we didn't have to Oh my
[2:44:46] goodness.
[2:44:48] There has to come one. Hallelujah. There
[2:44:51] has to come a real bride. There must
[2:44:53] come one that's not only got the
[2:44:55] mechanics.
[2:44:57] Oh, I thought you'd shout. I thought
[2:45:00] somebody would holler something. But the
[2:45:02] dynamics of it makes the church live,
[2:45:05] move in the power of his resurrection.
[2:45:08] Until we come to that place, until we
[2:45:11] find that place, what good does it do us
[2:45:14] to polish the hubs?
[2:45:17] What good does it do us to give her a
[2:45:19] facelift or a simonized job when there's
[2:45:22] no dynamics? He's talking about a car.
[2:45:25] No matter how much the mechanics proves
[2:45:26] it to be right, there has to be dynamics
[2:45:32] to make it work. He said that's what he
[2:45:35] proved. Hallelujah. He said that's what
[2:45:37] Easter proved. I'm going to say that's
[2:45:39] what first fruits proved. He wasn't only
[2:45:42] the word. He was God himself. The
[2:45:44] dynamics in the word
[2:45:49] that made the word that made the body of
[2:45:53] Jesus Christ
[2:45:55] cold,
[2:45:56] stiff, dead in the grave, shake
[2:46:01] into life and rise again and roll away
[2:46:05] the stone. He said, "I am he that was
[2:46:09] dead." Praise be to God. so dead till
[2:46:13] the sun said he was dead. The moon said
[2:46:15] he was dead, the stars said he was dead.
[2:46:18] All nature said he was dead. And now the
[2:46:20] whole world has to recognize, praise his
[2:46:23] holy name, that he's alive again. He was
[2:46:26] not only the mechanics, God's word, he
[2:46:29] was the dynamics
[2:46:31] to prove it.
[2:46:33] And as he being the groom, the bride has
[2:46:36] to come forth cuz it's part of him.
[2:46:40] And it can only be the manifestation of
[2:46:43] the fulfilling of all the revelations.
[2:46:45] Any others has spoke of the bride. It
[2:46:48] can only manifest if it does something
[2:46:50] different from the groom. If it does
[2:46:52] something different from the groom, it
[2:46:54] isn't the bride
[2:46:57] because she is flesh of his flesh, bone
[2:47:00] of his bone, life of his life.
[2:47:11] Power. Power of his
[2:47:15] power. She is
[2:47:17] him. Poor
[2:47:19] English.
[2:47:21] Powerful.
[2:47:24] Earthshattering
[2:47:25] truth. Who else could she be? Bone of
[2:47:29] his bone, flesh of his flesh, life of
[2:47:32] his life, power of his power. Who else
[2:47:34] could she be? She has to be a part of
[2:47:37] him. Separated from him like Eve was
[2:47:39] taken from
[2:47:42] Adam. A sphere went inside. Spear went
[2:47:45] inside his side. Blood and water came
[2:47:47] out. It was the
[2:47:50] separation. It was the separation.
[2:47:52] Thanks be to
[2:47:54] God. A man and a woman are one and women
[2:47:58] taken from the side from his side. She
[2:48:00] had taken a spirit, the feminine spirit
[2:48:02] from him, the flesh from his side, made
[2:48:04] both mechanics and dynamics. The wife,
[2:48:06] the spirit of him and the flesh of him,
[2:48:08] and put it together and made mechanics
[2:48:10] and dynamics.
[2:48:11] All these Easter
[2:48:15] bunnies and
[2:48:17] ceremonies, church, big churches and
[2:48:20] finery will fail and pass away. What are
[2:48:24] some of these folks going to do if they
[2:48:26] get that
[2:48:27] far? And we mark all of these beautiful
[2:48:30] things that God did and there's not one
[2:48:33] mention of the warm and fuzzy things
[2:48:35] that we hold to instead of holding to
[2:48:38] Jesus. What are you going to do in
[2:48:39] heaven when there's no bunny? What are
[2:48:41] you going to do in heaven when there's
[2:48:42] no tree? What are you going to do in
[2:48:44] heaven when there's no Santa Claus? What
[2:48:46] are you going to Are you still going to
[2:48:47] remember his birth? Are you still going
[2:48:49] to remember his resurrection? You're
[2:48:50] still going to remember his death when
[2:48:52] there are no crucifixes hanging around
[2:48:53] to remind us. Come on.
[2:48:56] He said, "Until the church becomes the
[2:48:58] both dynamics and mechanics and the
[2:49:00] spirit of God that moved him to do the
[2:49:01] things he did. If he if he hit on 16
[2:49:05] cylinders, so will the bride. For he
[2:49:08] said in John 14:12, he that believeth on
[2:49:10] me the works that I do, woo,
[2:49:14] shall he do also.
[2:49:16] I'll give him a change of my dynamics in
[2:49:18] his charge. I'll give him a charge of my
[2:49:21] dynamics in his mechanics that the world
[2:49:24] will not be able to withstand it. It'll
[2:49:25] raise him up again the last day. He said
[2:49:27] that's the Easter message. I'm going to
[2:49:28] say that's the first fruits message. I
[2:49:30] don't like saying that. I'm sorry. I
[2:49:32] don't like saying that over and over
[2:49:34] again. It's the first fruits message.
[2:49:37] The dynamics and the mechanics together.
[2:49:39] The mechanics without the dynamics. No
[2:49:41] good. Neither the dynamics without the
[2:49:42] mechanics.
[2:49:44] Few more. Few more. Sorry. You can
[2:49:47] scream and shout and jump up and down if
[2:49:49] you want to and deny the word
[2:49:52] and it won't do you any good. You're
[2:49:54] just cranking around. Pistons got the
[2:49:55] spark there to fire but no gasoline to
[2:49:57] fire it by. It'll only work as they come
[2:49:59] together. Amen. So how
[2:50:03] Jason, you ought to be jumping up and
[2:50:05] down. Mechanic. Brother Truman ought to
[2:50:07] be spinning around the room. These these
[2:50:10] mechanics I don't even know what some of
[2:50:12] this stuff is firing on 16 cylinder. all
[2:50:16] this talk but to those but I get it I
[2:50:19] may not can you know show you on the car
[2:50:22] where it happens but it
[2:50:25] happens you said just cranking around
[2:50:27] here it'll only work as they come
[2:50:29] together so one will sit still and the
[2:50:31] other one will go up that's the only
[2:50:32] thing there is to it yeah they both must
[2:50:34] look alike might look alike both claim
[2:50:36] to be churches both claim to be bride
[2:50:38] but one has the mechanics and the
[2:50:40] dynamics it brings it to pass of what he
[2:50:43] said in the truth it just won't move it
[2:50:45] won't move. It won't move no matter how
[2:50:48] good the mechanics is until the dynamics
[2:50:50] come. When the dynamics come, that fire
[2:50:53] is made to connect with that octane in
[2:50:56] the gasoline. And when that explodes, it
[2:50:58] causes a combustion. And that combustion
[2:51:00] moves every motion, every move. For he
[2:51:03] is the same yesterday, today, and
[2:51:05] forever. That's the resurrection. He
[2:51:09] said that's the real power of God.
[2:51:12] Mechanics and dynam with the dynamics.
[2:51:14] No. If that spirit that quickens, it's
[2:51:16] the spark that fires. It's not the gas
[2:51:19] that fires. It's the spark that fires
[2:51:22] the gas. One more. The last one. Come
[2:51:25] get ready to worship Benjamin in your
[2:51:26] pink jacket.
[2:51:31] You can do nothing without me,
[2:51:35] but with me, he said,
[2:51:38] you can do
[2:51:41] all.
[2:51:43] And he as he is the word it's the father
[2:51:46] living. Father sent me so send I you. As
[2:51:50] the father has fired me and pushed me
[2:51:52] into everything. I do only that which is
[2:51:55] pleasing to God. This is what he said.
[2:51:56] Now as he sent me so send I you with the
[2:51:59] same mechanics. And it takes the same
[2:52:01] dynamics to operate it. And these signs
[2:52:04] shall follow them that claim to have the
[2:52:06] the mechanics. No he said the dynamics
[2:52:09] will take the place. It's not claiming.
[2:52:12] It's possessing. So, we're here
[2:52:15] today
[2:52:17] thankful. You know, people say things
[2:52:20] like, "Well, it don't matter what day it
[2:52:21] what you call." It matters to me. Okay?
[2:52:23] It don't matter to most people, but it
[2:52:25] matters to me. But the reality is he
[2:52:27] lives.
[2:52:29] He
[2:52:31] lives. He lives.
[2:52:35] I the tomb of
[2:52:38] Buddha, the tomb of
[2:52:41] Muhammad, even the tomb of Peter. Why?
[2:52:44] Poor Peter's not even in his own
[2:52:49] tomb. But most of the great men who came
[2:52:52] and took a big
[2:52:54] following, if there's anything left of
[2:52:56] their bones or their
[2:52:58] ashes, just dust, they're right where
[2:53:01] they were laid. But I want you to know
[2:53:04] this Jesus that we serve, hallelujah,
[2:53:07] his tomb is empty. It will forever
[2:53:10] remain empty.
[2:53:14] Christians can't even agree on where
[2:53:15] he's
[2:53:19] buried. The Catholics, the Orthodox, the
[2:53:23] Coptics, the Greek
[2:53:26] Orthodox, they all have him inside the
[2:53:29] city.
[2:53:30] Even though the scripture tells us he
[2:53:32] died without the camp. He died on the
[2:53:34] outside of the city, it's very unlikely
[2:53:36] he was brought into the old walls of the
[2:53:38] city to be buried, particularly under a
[2:53:41] place where Queen Helena would build
[2:53:43] this great monument to his
[2:53:46] resurrection. But if you've ever been to
[2:53:48] Jerusalem and you've stood in the Garden
[2:53:50] of Gethsemane and you have been in that
[2:53:53] empty tomb, I don't care. I'll be
[2:53:56] honest, I don't care if he ever lay
[2:53:58] there or not.
[2:54:00] The reality is he laid somewhere in a
[2:54:02] borrowed tomb, but there's something in
[2:54:05] the depth of me that tells me I'm in the
[2:54:10] spot. I'm in the
[2:54:12] place. It fits scripture and it fits so
[2:54:15] many different historical events down
[2:54:18] through the ages. And if you've ever
[2:54:21] peeked in that room, you'll know there's
[2:54:23] nothing there. He's gone. And there's a
[2:54:27] sign engraved on the door that simply
[2:54:29] says, "He is
[2:54:34] risen." And I am so
[2:54:36] thankful that he has risen and he lives
[2:54:41] in the hearts of his people. If you
[2:54:45] believe that, say, "Amen." Amen. Let's
[2:54:47] stand and worship the Lord before we go
[2:54:49] home today.
[2:54:53] [Music]
[2:54:59] [Music]
[2:55:03] And father, I see that you are
[2:55:07] drawing a line in the sand. And I want
[2:55:11] to be standing on your
[2:55:14] side, holding your hand. So let your
[2:55:19] kingom
[2:55:21] come. Let it live in me. This is my
[2:55:28] prayer. This is my
[2:55:31] plea. And father, I see that you are
[2:55:36] drawing a line in the sand. And I want
[2:55:40] to be standing on your
[2:55:43] side, just holding your hand. So let
[2:55:48] your kingom come, Lord. Let it live in
[2:55:53] me. This is my
[2:55:57] prayer. This is my
[2:56:00] plea. Let the worippers
[2:56:07] arise. Let the sons and the daughters
[2:56:14] sing. I'm
[2:56:16] surrendering my all.
[2:56:21] All I surrender to the
[2:56:27] king. Oh, let the worippers
[2:56:35] arise. Oh, let the sons and the
[2:56:38] daughters sing.
[2:56:44] I'm surrendering my
[2:56:50] all. I surrender to the
[2:56:57] [Music]
[2:56:58] king. And father, I hear it growing
[2:57:03] louder. It's the song of the redeemed.
[2:57:07] As the saints from every
[2:57:10] nation, they're awakening to sing. Oh,
[2:57:14] and from our heart there comes an
[2:57:18] anthem to hear the heavens ring. This is
[2:57:22] our
[2:57:23] song. Oh, a song to our king. And let
[2:57:28] the worippers arise.
[2:57:33] Oh, let the sons and the daughters
[2:57:40] sing. Oh, I'm surrendering my
[2:57:46] all. Oh, I surrender to the
[2:57:49] king.
[2:57:52] Oh, let the worippers arise. Let the
[2:57:57] worippers arise.
[2:58:02] Oh, let the sons and the daughters sing.
[2:58:06] We sing to you, oh king.
[2:58:09] Oh, I'm surrendering my
[2:58:14] all.
[2:58:16] Oh, I surrender to the
[2:58:25] king. Father, I hear it growing louder.
[2:58:30] The song of the
[2:58:32] redeemed. As the saints of every
[2:58:36] nation, they're awakening to sing. Oh,
[2:58:40] and from our heart there comes an
[2:58:43] anthem. Oh, to hear the heavens ring.
[2:58:47] This is our
[2:58:49] song. Oh, a song to our
[2:58:52] king. Let the worippers arise.
[2:58:59] Oh, let the sons and the daughters sing.
[2:59:03] Oh, we sing to you, O king. Oh, I'm
[2:59:08] surrendering my all. I surrender to the
[2:59:13] king. I surrender to the
[2:59:20] king. Let the worippers arise.
[2:59:26] [Music]
[2:59:28] Let the sons and the daughters sing.
[2:59:35] I'm surrendering my
[2:59:42] all. I surrender to the king.
[2:59:52] [Music]
[2:59:57] Oh, in Christ alone will I
[3:00:03] glory, though I could pride myself in
[3:00:07] battles
[3:00:10] won. I've been blessed beyond
[3:00:14] measure and by his strength alone I
[3:00:19] overcome.
[3:00:23] And oh, I could stop and count
[3:00:28] successes like diamonds
[3:00:31] in my
[3:00:34] hands. But those trophies could not
[3:00:38] equal to the
[3:00:41] grace by which I
[3:00:45] stand. In Christ
[3:00:49] alone I place my
[3:00:53] trust and find my glory in the power of
[3:00:59] the
[3:01:01] cross. In every
[3:01:05] victory, oh let it be said of me then my
[3:01:11] source of strength.
[3:01:14] You're my source of
[3:01:16] hope is
[3:01:18] Christ
[3:01:24] alone. In Christ alone will I
[3:01:29] glory. For only by his strength I am
[3:01:34] redeemed.
[3:01:36] Yes. Yes. And only his tender
[3:01:40] mercy could reach beyond my weakness to
[3:01:45] my need.
[3:01:49] And
[3:01:50] now I seek no greater
[3:01:54] honor than just to know him
[3:01:59] more and to count my gains but losses to
[3:02:04] the
[3:02:06] glory of my
[3:02:09] Lord. In
[3:02:12] Christ
[3:02:13] alone I place all my
[3:02:17] trust and find my glory in the power of
[3:02:23] the
[3:02:25] cross. In every
[3:02:29] victory, oh let it be said of me that my
[3:02:35] source of strength. You are my source of
[3:02:40] hope is
[3:02:42] Christ
[3:02:44] alone. I place my
[3:02:47] trust and I find my glory in the power
[3:02:53] of the cross.
[3:02:56] Oh, in every
[3:02:59] victory, please let it be said of me
[3:03:04] that my source of strength. You are my
[3:03:09] source of
[3:03:10] hope is
[3:03:12] Christ
[3:03:14] alone. I place all my
[3:03:17] trust and I find my glory in the power
[3:03:23] of the cross.
[3:03:26] in every
[3:03:29] victory. Oh, let it be said of me that
[3:03:35] my source of strength. Lord, you are my
[3:03:39] source of
[3:03:40] hope is
[3:03:42] Christ
[3:03:46] [Music]
[3:03:48] alone. In Christ alone will I
[3:03:53] glory. For only by his grace I am
[3:04:00] redeemed. And only his tender
[3:04:04] mercy could reach beyond my weakness to
[3:04:09] my
[3:04:12] need. And
[3:04:14] now I seek no greater
[3:04:17] honor than just to know him more.
[3:04:24] and to count my gains but
[3:04:27] losses to the
[3:04:30] glory of my
[3:04:33] Lord. In Christ
[3:04:37] alone I place all my
[3:04:41] trust and find my glory in the power of
[3:04:46] the cross.
[3:04:50] in every
[3:04:52] victory. Oh, let it be said of me that
[3:04:58] my source of strength. Lord, you are my
[3:05:02] source of
[3:05:04] hope. It's Christ
[3:05:08] alone. I know this is like an anthem,
[3:05:11] but I want the music to go soft and I
[3:05:14] want to hear your voices singing. Do you
[3:05:16] do you understand the importance of what
[3:05:19] we're singing
[3:05:21] in Christ alone
[3:05:24] in nothing else?
[3:05:28] Not in a sister's dresses.
[3:05:32] not
[3:05:33] in all
[3:05:36] the uniforms and the things that we are
[3:05:40] convicted of and the things that we
[3:05:43] choose to do differently than the
[3:05:46] world. But our trust is in none of those
[3:05:48] things because you can do all of that.
[3:05:52] You can be sincere in all of your
[3:05:54] lifestyle choices. And if Christ is not
[3:05:58] your source of
[3:05:59] strength, and if you're sharing it with
[3:06:02] your pastor or sharing it with a prophet
[3:06:04] or sharing it with someone else, you're
[3:06:07] missing the
[3:06:08] mark. It's in Christ alone that we
[3:06:11] trust. We certainly don't trust
[3:06:14] ourselves. I want to hear your voices. I
[3:06:17] got a feeling you can do this really
[3:06:18] nice. I don't know
[3:06:21] what I got a feeling that you can do
[3:06:23] this really nice.
[3:06:25] I want to hear you sing it again. The
[3:06:28] music can be there but just not so
[3:06:32] predominant. In Christ
[3:06:36] alone I place my
[3:06:41] trust and find my glory in the power of
[3:06:47] the cross.
[3:06:50] In every victory.
[3:06:54] Woo! Let it be
[3:06:56] said of me. And my source of
[3:07:02] strength. You're my source of
[3:07:06] hope is
[3:07:08] Christ
[3:07:10] alone. I place my
[3:07:14] trust and find my glory in the power of
[3:07:20] the cross.
[3:07:23] In every
[3:07:27] victory, let it be
[3:07:29] said of me. And my source of
[3:07:35] strength and my source of
[3:07:38] hope is
[3:07:40] Christ alone.
[3:07:44] One last time. One last time. In Christ
[3:07:50] alone I place my
[3:07:54] trust and find my glory in the power of
[3:08:00] the
[3:08:02] cross. In every
[3:08:07] victory let it be
[3:08:09] said of
[3:08:11] me my source of strength. Lord, you are
[3:08:16] my source of
[3:08:19] hope. Is
[3:08:20] Christ the
[3:08:23] [Music]
[3:08:26] Lord. Lord Jesus, we we just love you
[3:08:30] supremely above all
[3:08:32] things. You're so good to us. Would you
[3:08:35] just hold still a minute and we want to
[3:08:38] pray. We want to anoint Alana in prayer
[3:08:41] and ask the Lord to just finish his
[3:08:44] healing work in her body. And she, like
[3:08:48] Cindy, is still grieving. She has lost
[3:08:51] her husband and her world is upside down
[3:08:54] and she's been streaming our services
[3:08:57] when she can. She's recovering from
[3:08:59] serious
[3:09:01] surgery. And uh she wanted to be prayed
[3:09:04] for. And I was up there kicking myself
[3:09:06] because I I looked back and they were
[3:09:08] gone. And I'm thinking, you should have
[3:09:11] just stopped
[3:09:13] early. And as I started stretching
[3:09:16] around up there, I saw they were over
[3:09:17] here. And I said, "Oh, thank you, Lord.
[3:09:20] Would you reach your hands this way as
[3:09:23] we pray for her? Father, how we thank
[3:09:27] you that you are the same yesterday,
[3:09:31] today, and forever. You change not. She
[3:09:35] came today with a desire that we would
[3:09:38] join our faith with hers and we would
[3:09:41] ask you to come and be Jehovah Rafa, the
[3:09:44] Lord God who heals all of our diseases
[3:09:47] and infirmities. Thank you for a good
[3:09:50] surgeon. Thank you for for a successful
[3:09:53] surgery. But Lord, we know that healing
[3:09:56] lies alone in you. And if this body does
[3:10:01] what you created it to do, it's because
[3:10:03] of you. It's because of your quickening
[3:10:06] power. So I
[3:10:09] pray, I pray,
[3:10:12] elo in the name of Jesus that you would
[3:10:16] manifest such
[3:10:18] healing, bearing the pain, oh God, and
[3:10:24] giving quick healing to this body. Yes.
[3:10:28] In the name of Jesus, draw her, Lord,
[3:10:31] right up under your arm. Yes, Lord. Let
[3:10:35] her lay her head on your shoulder and
[3:10:38] find refuge and hope and peace in
[3:10:43] you. Would you pour oil on her broken
[3:10:47] heart? Would you heal,
[3:10:52] Lord? Her life of course forever
[3:10:56] altered but Lord what a moment for you
[3:10:59] to come and be everything that she needs
[3:11:03] in this
[3:11:05] hour. Thank you sweet
[3:11:08] Jesus. Thank you Lord for the for the
[3:11:11] great effort that she made to
[3:11:14] come. Jesus manifest yourself I pray in
[3:11:19] the name of
[3:11:20] Jesus. Praise God.
[3:11:24] Praise
[3:11:25] God. That's our privilege. We love you.
[3:11:30] [Music]
[3:11:32] Thank
[3:11:35] you. If you have a need, just lift your
[3:11:39] hands to him. Lord, you're our source.
[3:11:42] You are our
[3:11:43] supply. You are all that we need. It's
[3:11:47] all found in you. We thank you for
[3:11:50] doctors. We thank you for their
[3:11:52] medicine. We thank you for their care.
[3:11:55] But Lord, again, we recognize that if
[3:11:58] healing comes, it's because of
[3:12:01] you. Would you touch every person here
[3:12:04] who needs help in their body and those
[3:12:06] streaming the service, those who have
[3:12:10] spiritual needs, would you meet them
[3:12:11] here today,
[3:12:13] Lord? Encourage the discouraged.
[3:12:18] Help the cold in heart to find a fire
[3:12:22] again. Help the
[3:12:25] backslider to make you Lord of all
[3:12:29] again. If we have not been passionately
[3:12:33] in love with you for a while, stir our
[3:12:37] hearts. May we see you in your
[3:12:41] beauty and may that inspire us to long
[3:12:44] for you.
[3:12:47] We thank you for choosing us when we
[3:12:50] didn't even know yet to choose
[3:12:54] you. We get a little stirred in times
[3:12:57] like this,
[3:12:59] but there's no condemnation in my heart
[3:13:02] for anybody who doesn't know any better.
[3:13:06] I pray for those who who don't know
[3:13:08] better, who don't know the fullness of
[3:13:12] who you are in your word, that you would
[3:13:14] reach them, sincere hearts, precious
[3:13:17] loved ones, reach them with the full
[3:13:20] manifestation of who you are. And may
[3:13:23] they
[3:13:24] flee to you. May they run to you with
[3:13:27] every fiber of their being. Those who
[3:13:30] have not yet been baptized in your
[3:13:32] lovely name, may they may they obey you.
[3:13:36] Yes. Let that be the beginning of a
[3:13:39] journey of discovery.
[3:13:42] May we leave here today with not just
[3:13:44] mechanics under our belt, but may we
[3:13:47] leave here knowing that you have also
[3:13:49] placed your dynamics in us.
[3:13:52] Bless these
[3:13:54] people for every sacrifice they've ever
[3:13:57] made for your name, for this
[3:14:02] house. Lord, bless these sweet
[3:14:05] children who love to come and worship
[3:14:08] your
[3:14:09] name. Lord, we ask for sister Flo to
[3:14:12] find perfect strength and health. And
[3:14:15] may she go and be a blessing. We know
[3:14:18] what she can do for an
[3:14:21] atmosphere. We pray that her life will
[3:14:23] shine. Yes.
[3:14:27] Lord, you put the right person beside
[3:14:29] her all the way. Yes. Give her the right
[3:14:32] word and may she come home. Oh, she
[3:14:35] might be a little tired, but may she
[3:14:36] come home refreshed. Lord,
[3:14:42] Lord, watch over those traveling right
[3:14:43] now to get home. Our precious young
[3:14:46] people.
[3:14:47] They've stuck pretty close together.
[3:14:49] I've been blessed to have some amazing
[3:14:51] pictures sent to me of them and they
[3:14:55] went through the prayer line last night
[3:14:56] and received a touch from you. May they
[3:14:59] come home and feed their experience.
[3:15:01] Yes. May they come home and be a just a
[3:15:05] blast of strength for all of us.
[3:15:10] We leave this house very very happy to
[3:15:12] have been in your presence.
[3:15:14] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[3:15:19] pray. And the saints said God bless you
[3:15:24] as you leave here today.
[3:15:28] In every
[3:15:31] victory, let it be said of
[3:15:35] me. My source of strength.
[3:15:40] You're my source of
[3:15:42] hope. In Christ
[3:15:46] alone I place my
[3:15:50] trust and find my glory in the power of
[3:15:56] the
[3:15:59] cross. In every
[3:16:03] victory let it be said of me. My source
[3:16:09] of
[3:16:10] strength. You are my source of
[3:16:14] hope in
[3:16:16] Christ
[3:16:18] alone. I place my trust
[3:16:23] and find my glory in the power of the
[3:16:29] cross. God bless you as you in every
[3:16:35] victory. Let it be
[3:16:37] said of me. my source of
[3:16:42] strength. You are my source of
[3:16:46] hope in
[3:16:48] Christ
[3:16:54] alone. Oh, in Christ alone will I
[3:16:59] glory. Though I could prize myself in
[3:17:04] battles won. You read the limelight. You
[3:17:06] read the limelight. Though I've been
[3:17:08] blessed. beyond
[3:17:11] measure and by his strength alone I
[3:17:16] overcome.
[3:17:18] This is important in my mind. Oh, I
[3:17:22] could stop and count
[3:17:24] successes like diamonds
[3:17:27] in my hands.
[3:17:30] [Music]
[3:17:31] But those trophies could not
[3:17:35] equal the
[3:17:37] grace by which I
[3:17:41] stand in Christ alone. God bless you,
[3:17:46] buddy. I'm playing.
