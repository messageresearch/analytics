[0:09] will you live the Jesus life the
[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right Weist
[0:43] in you the hope award
[0:45] [Music]
[0:58] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[1:01] Shelley of New Hope revival ministries
[1:03] right here in Smith Station Alabama and
[1:07] I'm coming to you again today with our
[1:10] partnership with the gospel channel
[1:13] we so appreciate the work of the Lord
[1:15] that they are accomplishing and we are
[1:18] very blessed that we get to be a part of
[1:20] that outreach and so once again we
[1:23] invite you to pray for the gospel
[1:26] channel pray for brother Eric Erickson
[1:28] and the staff that God will anoint them
[1:32] that God will direct their thoughts that
[1:35] he will give them grace and wisdom and
[1:38] that there will be provision needed to
[1:41] maintain what the Lord has already
[1:42] opened up the doors that are already
[1:45] open and I would like for you to agree
[1:48] with me that there will be new doors of
[1:50] opportunity open for the gospel channel
[1:54] we feel very blessed because wherever
[1:56] the gospel channel goes new hope revival
[1:59] ministry gets to go with them and I pray
[2:02] that you have been blessed by the
[2:04] programs that we have been doing for
[2:07] many years we came to you on the gospel
[2:09] channel through the Eagles cry and
[2:11] that's a program that we would like to
[2:14] revive we would like to do that again
[2:16] and that's certainly in our plans and
[2:19] it's a matter of Prayer 30-minute
[2:22] program that aired several times a week
[2:24] but we feel very blessed to have this
[2:28] opportunity to come to you during this
[2:31] time slot and we get a whole hour which
[2:35] it might be a little harder for you to
[2:37] stay with me an hour but it's a whole
[2:39] lot easier for me I appreciate the extra
[2:43] time because quite often it takes me a
[2:46] while to get rolling and then when I
[2:48] when I get rolling I have a hard time
[2:50] coming to a stop if you miss a program
[2:54] in a particular series that we do we
[2:57] have made them available for you on
[3:00] YouTube if you'll just do a search for
[3:02] New Hope revival ministries you will
[3:04] find our YouTube channel
[3:07] you will also find a button there that
[3:09] you can subscribe so that when we add
[3:12] new content to our channel you'll be

[3:19] downloading our new hope revival
[3:22] ministries app it is available on the
[3:25] different app stores of your platform
[3:27] whatever you are using for your
[3:30] smartphone or your tablet and we've been
[3:34] getting good response because all of the
[3:38] programming is available there there's
[3:40] music there there are some archived
[3:43] sermons from a generation ago that will
[3:47] be a great blessing to you in your life
[3:49] I know they will and so check that out
[3:52] also you can visit our ministry website
[3:55] at revival dot o-r-g we have also
[3:59] various social media accounts where from
[4:03] time to time we are posting our videos
[4:06] and we have something called new hope
[4:08] moments that are just small nuggets that
[4:12] are taken from our live preaching
[4:14] services and the Lord has really been
[4:17] using them I look just a few minutes ago
[4:20] and one that was just posted very very
[4:23] recently had already been viewed 1,000
[4:26] times on Facebook and of course we have
[4:29] no way of knowing how many times it's
[4:31] viewed on the app and on YouTube and all
[4:35] of the different ways that we have but
[4:38] we are just looking for whatever the
[4:42] Lord will direct us to to get the good
[4:45] news out and we want to be an
[4:48] inspiration to you and we want you to
[4:50] know that God is still the same we say
[4:55] this almost every time we be together
[4:57] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[5:01] and forever and we just believe that God
[5:05] wants to move in our lives he wants to
[5:08] move in your life individually and he
[5:12] wants to show himself real and strong
[5:15] and if you'll allow him
[5:17] I believe you hold the key if you will
[5:21] allow him he will come and remind you in
[5:24] many various ways that he loves you that
[5:27] he cares about you and that he sees your
[5:30] need I know so often we feel alone in
[5:34] this life in this world we sometimes we
[5:38] have friends but no there's just certain
[5:40] ways we feel and things we go through
[5:43] that we feel like there's no one we can
[5:45] tell but I want you to know that you can
[5:48] always go to Jesus he is available and I
[5:52] I know when we pray we we want to be
[5:55] respectful and we want to lay it out
[5:57] with with great honor for the one who
[6:00] loves us so much but I also want you to
[6:03] know that he's a friend that sticketh
[6:05] closer than a brother and you can just
[6:08] tell God you know you can just open up
[6:10] your heart and tell him what's going on
[6:13] and what you need from him and he'll
[6:15] direct you he will answer and I think we
[6:19] mentioned a few programs back that that
[6:22] old song that precious sister used to
[6:25] sing in our church he may not come when
[6:27] you want him but he's right on time and
[6:30] truly God is a known time God we have
[6:34] been talking last time we were together
[6:37] about unfresh anointing and we came to
[6:41] that thought because of something that
[6:44] the Lord had been speaking to us about
[6:46] in our local church our local ministry
[6:49] he was introducing us to a new season he
[6:53] was inviting us into a new season with
[6:57] him and a new season means there's going
[7:03] to be change and sometimes change is
[7:06] uncomfortable but change is necessary
[7:09] and change is inevitable if we ever want
[7:14] to go beyond where we are right now not
[7:18] be stuck then there has to be change
[7:21] there really has to be change and so we
[7:25] pray for change we believe that that is
[7:28] part of what God wants to execute in our
[7:30] lives but we also understand
[7:34] that you and I have some power we have
[7:37] some authority according to the
[7:38] scripture to bring about some change in
[7:42] our own lives and in our own
[7:44] circumstances and sometimes the change
[7:47] that we really need is something
[7:50] internal something within we talked
[7:54] about the last time we were together
[7:56] changing our thoughts how important that
[7:59] is because if we can change our thoughts
[8:03] we begin to change our words and with
[8:07] our thoughts and our words being
[8:09] corrected and coming into alignment with
[8:12] God's truth about our lives then change
[8:17] becomes inevitable and we begin to move
[8:21] forward into what the Lord has for us
[8:24] and so we're what we want to go back
[8:26] today I want to go back and begin to
[8:29] talk to you a little bit more about that
[8:32] fresh anointing that God is sending upon
[8:36] those who who step up and begin to cry
[8:39] out for it you know if we know
[8:41] something's available and we don't we
[8:43] don't bother to pursue it then then
[8:46] we're the ones who lose but when we
[8:48] begin to hear the Lord saying in our
[8:51] services prophetically that he wanted to
[8:54] send a fresh anointing to help us with
[8:58] the new season well I just step up in
[9:00] faith and I say me let me be first I
[9:04] want and desire a fresh experience with
[9:08] the presence of Jesus Christ I know that
[9:11] we can't live by experience we have to
[9:15] live by faith but God loves you so much
[9:18] that he wants you to experience the
[9:22] realness of his presence we were sharing
[9:26] with you the scripture from Isaiah that
[9:29] tells us because of the anointing the
[9:34] yoke is destroyed and then toward the
[9:37] end of our program the last time we
[9:39] shared Psalm 92 10 but my horn shalt
[9:44] thou exalt like the horn
[9:47] of a unicorn I shall be anointed with
[9:51] fresh oil and we were even declaring
[9:53] that together
[9:54] I am anointed with fresh oil I want to
[10:00] just read a couple of statements that I
[10:02] shared with you the last time we were
[10:04] together and then move on to another
[10:06] portion of the lesson today the
[10:08] anointing is not a feeling not an idea
[10:12] not an emotion not an atmosphere the
[10:16] anointing is a knowing and assurance
[10:20] that comes by revelation a divine
[10:25] empowering to carry us through the next
[10:30] assignment and the next season can I
[10:33] read that line again the anointing is a
[10:36] divine empowering to carry us through
[10:40] the next assignment and season can you
[10:44] say I want that I want that in my life
[10:49] I truly do when we say the word Christ
[10:52] that word was transliterated from the
[10:56] Greek word Christos and that word
[10:59] Christos means very much like it's it's
[11:04] at the equivalent to the Hebrew word
[11:07] that means The Anointed One the Messiah
[11:11] the Messiah so Christ is the anointing
[11:17] he is the Anointed One The Fountainhead
[11:23] of all anointing is the Lord Jesus
[11:26] Christ the root of David Earth's one
[11:30] true Messiah
[11:33] we must never look at the anointing as a
[11:36] thing but rather the presence of a
[11:39] person the person of the Lord Jesus
[11:42] Christ so if we are praying for a new
[11:47] anointing or if the Lord promises that
[11:50] he wants to give to us a new anointing
[11:52] it means a fresh encounter with the
[11:57] presence of the Lord
[11:58] I don't know about
[12:00] you but I love to experience the
[12:02] presence of the Lord I think that is
[12:05] probably one of the reasons why I feel
[12:08] so passionate about praise and worship
[12:11] is because when we begin to praise Him
[12:16] and worship Him when we allow praise to
[12:21] be created as the fruit of our lips when
[12:25] we align our hearts with him it is
[12:30] almost inevitable that we will begin to
[12:35] feel the presence of the Lord the Bible
[12:40] says that he lives in he inhabits the
[12:47] praises of his people so when we praise
[12:50] Him he comes to live to make himself
[12:54] known in those praises our praise
[13:00] becomes the atmosphere for his presence
[13:04] to be ushered in and I have come to love
[13:08] that presence there is a song that we
[13:13] sing sometime I love your presence and
[13:16] someone questioned me one time very well
[13:19] meaning not being critical at all young
[13:22] person and they said brother Shelly is
[13:25] it all right to love the presence aren't
[13:29] we supposed to love the Lord Jesus and I
[13:32] said yes of course we must love the Lord
[13:35] Jesus Christ but if we love him we're
[13:39] going to love where he comes we're going
[13:43] to love to experience him and when we
[13:47] experience him that's what we're feeling
[13:49] that's what we're touching his presence
[13:53] the Old Testament uses the word glory
[13:57] which is the kavod the heavy weightiness
[14:02] of the presence of God and I want you to
[14:05] know that I live to feel to experience
[14:10] that glory that presence
[14:13] I don't have a feeling driven faith I
[14:18] have a faith driven feeling I love to
[14:22] feel and to experience but I want you to
[14:24] know that a feeling is not enough to
[14:27] keep you coming back a feeling is not
[14:30] enough to keep you pressing through the
[14:33] valley when when it gets hard when the
[14:36] doctor's report is bad when when
[14:39] everything around you is crumbling when
[14:42] you've lost your best friend when your
[14:44] marriage is falling apart and your
[14:46] children are wandering from God a
[14:49] feeling is not enough you'll have to
[14:52] have something more than that you'll
[14:54] have to have a faith filled relationship
[14:57] with Jesus Christ but oh how sweet it is
[15:01] to feel him to have his presence come
[15:06] and touch our lives or to be able to
[15:09] reach out in faith in praise in prayer
[15:12] in worship and know that we have touched
[15:15] his presence so yes the answer is it's
[15:18] alright to love his presence as long as
[15:22] you understand that it's more than a
[15:25] feeling it is a divine atmosphere a
[15:29] divine reminder that our Lord Jesus
[15:33] Christ is in the room by the power of
[15:36] the Holy Ghost and he will come to you
[15:38] in that anointing he will come to you in
[15:41] that presence wherever you are when you
[15:45] need him if you're willing to reach out
[15:47] in faith believing he can show up I'll
[15:50] tell you he has shown up for me many
[15:53] many many times so we're not looking at
[15:57] the anointing like a thing like a
[16:00] feeling but we're recognizing that it is
[16:04] a person the person of the Lord Jesus
[16:05] Christ and we have come to understand
[16:09] and we should that there are levels and
[16:12] dimensions and intensities of his
[16:16] presence the anointing we don't always
[16:18] encounter his presence the same way
[16:21] every time
[16:23] there are levels dimensions degrees
[16:26] intensities of that presence but I love
[16:29] them all I do sometimes the presence of
[16:33] the Lord comes and it feels so sweet so
[16:37] loving and so precious
[16:38] sometimes the presence of God comes and
[16:41] it feels earth-shattering it feels like
[16:44] everything within you it's going to be
[16:46] broken up because the intensity of his
[16:49] glory becomes so powerful but I love all
[16:53] all the expressions I love all of the
[16:56] intensities of his presence and I tell
[16:59] you once you've encountered the
[17:01] anointing you're spoiled you'll never be
[17:05] satisfied with dry formal religion ever
[17:09] again once you know that as a Holy Ghost
[17:12] filled believer washed in the blood of
[17:15] Jesus baptized in its precious name you
[17:18] have access to that presence once you
[17:22] learn that you'll never be satisfied
[17:24] with just a form any longer denying the
[17:29] power but you'll be reaching out for
[17:31] more of the presence and more of the
[17:34] power of God everything we do in Christ
[17:38] is is an upward climb really it's a
[17:41] journey and we're moving closer to Co
[17:44] and closer to the end of this journey
[17:46] where we step out of this dimension of
[17:49] time and into the dimension of eternity
[17:52] I like to use these expressions from
[17:55] Romans 1:17 Psalm 84 7 and 2nd
[18:00] Corinthians 3:18 we are journeying from
[18:04] glory to glory from strength to strength
[18:08] from faith to faith and I love that
[18:13] because it helps me to understand the
[18:15] faith I have right now is leading me to
[18:19] a deeper faith the glory that I
[18:21] experience right now is making room and
[18:25] taking me forward to experience helping
[18:29] me be positioned to experience more
[18:32] glory and the strength that I have right
[18:34] now is sustained
[18:36] me for what I'm walking through right
[18:39] now but this strength gives way leads
[18:43] forward to more strength when I have
[18:46] need of it it is indeed a journey and so
[18:50] sometimes we just have to remind
[18:52] ourselves I've got a journey on I've got
[18:55] to press on toward the mark there are
[18:57] many many voices calling out to get our
[19:01] attention and there are many things that
[19:03] happen in life to discourage us to make
[19:06] us want to lay down and give up and quit
[19:08] but you cannot you must not you've got
[19:12] to get back up and keep pressing toward
[19:15] Christ each new season in our lives
[19:18] brings new assignments new connections
[19:22] new testings and trials there will be
[19:25] new choices to make there will be new
[19:28] territories to explore and there will be
[19:31] new temptations with all of that newness
[19:34] with all of that change it's reasonable
[19:39] for me to believe that I will need a new
[19:43] fresh touch of God's oil of his
[19:47] anointing of his glory the enemies that
[19:50] have been defeated in the past season
[19:53] they will regather they will they will
[19:56] you know or reorganize is the word I was
[20:00] looking for and they'll come at you
[20:02] maybe not the same way that they did in
[20:05] the last season they'll find another way
[20:07] to come at you but the truth is the same
[20:10] victory that God gave you in the last
[20:12] season is available for you in the new
[20:16] season and it's made even more possible
[20:20] by a fresh touch of his anointing a
[20:24] fresh oil that comes from his hand
[20:29] therefore that new level of anointing
[20:32] becomes necessary to navigate the
[20:35] unchartered path that lies before us
[20:38] when God invites us into a new season we
[20:43] will need to be filled with greater
[20:44] glory than we experienced in previous
[20:47] seasons
[20:49] the process and the progression of
[20:51] stepping into both fresh and deeper
[20:54] places in the anointing is carefully
[20:57] illustrated by the experience that
[21:00] Ezekiel had with the healing River that
[21:03] is promised to flow from the Millennial
[21:06] temple I want to read that with you
[21:08] today I want us to take a look at that
[21:10] it is found in Ezekiel chapter 47 and
[21:15] the first nine verses of Ezekiel 47 and
[21:20] because there are nine verses in this
[21:23] text I'm going to read a little quicker
[21:25] all right so that we can get through all
[21:27] nine verses afterward he brought me
[21:30] again under the door of the house and
[21:32] behold waters issued out from under the
[21:35] threshold of the house eastward for the
[21:39] forefront of the house stood toward the
[21:42] east and the waters came down from under
[21:45] from the right side of the house at the
[21:48] south side of the altar then brought he
[21:51] me out of the way of the gate northward
[21:54] and led me about the way without unto
[21:57] the utter gate by the way that looketh
[21:59] eastward and behold there ran out waters
[22:02] on the right side and when the man that
[22:06] had the line in his hand went forth
[22:08] eastward he measured a thousand cubits
[22:11] and he brought me through the waters the
[22:15] waters were to the ankles again he
[22:18] measured a thousand and brought me
[22:20] through the waters the waters were to
[22:23] the knees again he measured a thousand
[22:26] and brought me through the waters were
[22:28] to the loins afterward he measured a
[22:31] thousand and it was a river that I could
[22:35] not pass over for the waters were risen
[22:38] waters to swim in a river that could not
[22:43] be passed over and he said unto me son
[22:46] of man has thou seen this then he
[22:50] brought me and caused me to return to
[22:52] the brink of the river now when I had
[22:54] returned behold at the bank of
[22:56] River were very many trees on the one
[22:59] side and on the other then said he unto
[23:02] me these waters issue out toward the
[23:05] east country and go down into the desert
[23:08] and go into the sea which being brought
[23:11] forth Indus to see the waters shall be
[23:14] healed and it shall come to pass that
[23:17] everything that liveth which moveth
[23:20] whithersoever the river shall come shall
[23:22] live and there shall be a very great
[23:25] multitude of fish because these waters
[23:29] shall come thither for they shall be
[23:31] healed and everything shall live whither
[23:35] the river cometh
[23:36] this was Ezekiel's experience with a
[23:40] healing river that flowed forth from the
[23:43] altar of that Millennial temple that
[23:46] Ezekiel prophesied about a water a river
[23:49] that will flow down from the temple down
[23:52] into the valley all the way down that
[23:56] route from Jerusalem toward Jericho and
[24:00] beyond to where the Jordan River empties
[24:05] into the Dead Sea we know that there is
[24:10] no life in the Dead Sea
[24:13] we used to could say that with such
[24:15] assurance and such certainty but we have
[24:19] found out in the past few years that
[24:21] there are a few places in the Dead Sea
[24:24] where a little fresh stream of water is
[24:28] poking up out of the bottom of the Dead
[24:32] Sea just a little spring of water just
[24:35] about is narrow as your finger and I saw
[24:39] a video myself of this tiny little I
[24:44] guess they're single-celled organisms
[24:47] little plankton that live only in the
[24:52] area the parameter of that little bit of
[24:56] living water fresh water that comes out
[25:00] of that spring if those little creatures
[25:03] swim beyond the stream the little little
[25:06] place where that stream is coming up
[25:08] they die
[25:10] because the mineral content is so strong
[25:12] so heavy in the Dead Sea that nothing
[25:15] can live but Ezekiel had an experience
[25:19] that there would be a river that would
[25:21] flow from the altar of the temple right
[25:25] down into the Dead Sea and wherever that
[25:28] River went oh how prophetic that is
[25:31] wherever that River went it carried life
[25:35] and things would live that were touched
[25:39] by that River eventually washing fish
[25:42] down into the Dead Sea where they have
[25:45] never lived and even in the miry places
[25:48] and the marshy places life would come
[25:51] because of that healing River I love the
[25:54] way that the Spirit Illustrated this to
[25:57] Ezekiel by taking a measuring rod or a
[26:02] measuring device and going forward 1000
[26:07] cubits which is approximately a quarter
[26:11] of a mile a cubit and their variations
[26:14] of thought but a cubit is about 18
[26:17] inches or one and a half feet he walked
[26:20] about 1,500 feet or the length of five
[26:25] football fields the water would begin to
[26:29] get deeper and deeper as he walked out
[26:32] the 1000 cubits that had been measured
[26:37] for him by this messenger of the Lord
[26:40] his first stop was a place where the
[26:45] water ran to the ankles meaning that
[26:49] only the feet were submerged beneath the
[26:52] water that speaks to us about our walk
[26:57] our daily walk I want you to know that
[27:00] our daily walk is very important how we
[27:03] live for Jesus Christ every day is very
[27:07] very important our consistency and our
[27:11] testimony is such an important part of
[27:14] who we are as ambassadors for Jesus
[27:17] Christ because people are watching us
[27:19] you know people expect
[27:22] to be a hypocrite they expect me to be a
[27:25] hypocrite to say one thing and do
[27:28] another I don't like it when people tell
[27:30] me well I would go to church but every
[27:32] church is filled with hypocrites and
[27:35] when they tell me that I often say to
[27:37] them well the hypocrite is closer to God
[27:40] than you are because you're putting the
[27:43] hypocrite between you and God
[27:46] that means that the position of the
[27:48] hypocrite is closer to God than the one
[27:50] you're standing in we should have no
[27:53] excuse yes you're right there are many
[27:56] people who confess one thing and live
[27:59] another thing but God's got an anointing
[28:02] he has an overflow of his Spirit to help
[28:06] us fresh oil to help us in our daily
[28:11] walk we need to come to that place in
[28:14] the leadership of the Spirit that our
[28:17] feet our walk has been submerged beneath
[28:21] that healing water that living water
[28:24] you see I see these different degrees of
[28:27] water levels of water measures of water
[28:31] as God's saying to Ezekiel as you
[28:34] journey on as you continue following the
[28:37] messenger of the Lord you'll get out
[28:40] into the strength to strength faith to
[28:42] faith you'll get out into that place
[28:45] where grace gives way to greater grace
[28:47] and glory gives way to greater glory you
[28:50] can't choose to stay in one level of
[28:54] what God desires to do in your life
[28:56] you've got to receive all that there is
[28:58] to receive in this season and then reach
[29:01] forward to the next season do you
[29:04] understand what I'm sharing with you
[29:06] today when we look at that walk that is
[29:10] represented to us in Ezekiel's
[29:12] experience by the river water submerging
[29:16] his feet or just covering his feet walk
[29:19] is often used in the scripture for a
[29:21] conduct in life our general demeanor and
[29:25] our department in life it has been said
[29:28] that Enoch and Noah walked with God it
[29:32] means their life was very
[29:35] very consistent they maintained a course
[29:39] of action conformed to God's will and
[29:43] one that was acceptable in his sight in
[29:47] the Old Testament and in the New
[29:49] Testament we find God promising to walk
[29:53] with his people and in his people on the
[29:58] other hand desiring the influence of the
[30:00] Holy Spirit we desire that Holy Spirit
[30:03] to be with us as well that we might walk
[30:06] in the statues of God that comes from
[30:10] hungers Bible Dictionary that is a
[30:13] source that many of you will be familiar
[30:16] with after Ezekiel had walked to the
[30:20] first point where the water was just
[30:24] above the ankles a thousand cubits the
[30:29] Spirit of the Lord and the messenger of
[30:31] the Lord led him to go farther another
[30:34] 1000 cubits and the waters came to his
[30:37] knees when we read about knees in the
[30:41] Bible it speaks to us of both our prayer
[30:44] life and our worship the need to bow the
[30:49] knee is to perform an act of worship
[30:53] kneeling in prayer was a practice of
[30:56] great antiquity and references are made
[30:58] in both the Old Testament and the New
[31:01] Testament knees are used symbolically
[31:05] for persons even in job 4:4 and Hebrews
[31:09] 12:12 and that also comes from the
[31:12] hungers Bible dictionary so what we see
[31:16] is that there is one place in God where
[31:19] he's covering us in our walk with Him
[31:22] and as we move deeper in the spirit
[31:24] River in the healing River we come to a
[31:27] place where the water is up to our knees
[31:30] because I believe is zekiel is an
[31:33] example to the believer of how we grow
[31:37] in grace and how we grow with the
[31:40] intensity of the spirit so now the water
[31:43] is flowing to the knees and it means my
[31:46] prayer life is anointed not only is
[31:49] my walk my devotion my testimony
[31:52] anointed but now my walk but now my
[31:56] worship and my prayer life is anointed
[31:59] with God its anointed by the Holy Spirit
[32:02] of God and then the messenger of the
[32:05] Lord went forward another 1000 cubits
[32:08] measuring it out carefully
[32:09] Ezekiel walking along and he comes to a
[32:13] place where the Bible said that the
[32:15] water was to the loins and this is an
[32:20] area of the body identified in Scripture
[32:23] with with reproductive life and so we
[32:27] understand by looking at different
[32:29] sources that literally this means the
[32:32] parts of the back and the sides of the
[32:34] human or the animal body that parallel
[32:37] the spine on each side extending between
[32:41] the ribs and the hips and it is used as
[32:45] a euphemism for reproductive power so
[32:49] now
[32:49] Ezekiel's walk has been anointed now his
[32:53] prayer life and worship has been
[32:56] anointed by this healing River and now
[32:59] his witness because one of the ways that
[33:04] we see Christ reproduced the life of
[33:08] Christ reproduced is by walking
[33:12] consistently our testimony and our
[33:15] witness being something that shows oh my
[33:20] demonstrators
[33:22] what a life surrendered to God really
[33:26] looks like if we want to make a
[33:28] difference you know we can talk all day
[33:31] long about the goodness of God and how
[33:33] wonderful it is to be saved and to be a
[33:35] Christian but if our life is not
[33:38] demonstrating that then nobody's really
[33:41] going to want to go through all the
[33:44] grind if it's not going to produce
[33:46] anything in in our life and so I love
[33:50] the fact that it starts off Lord help me
[33:53] get my daily walk straightened out and
[33:55] then let me learn the importance of
[33:58] prayer and praise and worship
[34:01] and then let me come in to another level
[34:03] of anointing of spirit life that will
[34:06] help me understand how I can reproduce
[34:09] this life how I can reflect this life in
[34:13] such a way others will also desire to
[34:16] know him in a greater way and then the
[34:19] next thing you know the messenger of the
[34:21] Lord goes forward another 1000 cubits
[34:24] and DeCicco walks along and he finds a
[34:29] river that cannot be passed over he
[34:33] finds waters to swim in now his whole
[34:36] body can be submerged he couldn't swim
[34:39] in ankle deep water I doubt he could
[34:42] have swam very good in knee-deep water
[34:45] maybe law in deep he could have he could
[34:48] have moved around and swimming a little
[34:49] bit but oh my when he came to that place
[34:52] that the waters were so deep they
[34:54] couldn't be passed over he described
[34:56] that as waters to swim in to be totally
[35:00] submerged in and I believe God has got
[35:04] spirit life for you like that
[35:07] I believe indeed there is a healing
[35:09] River like that and experience for you
[35:12] where you are absolutely submerged in
[35:16] the Spirit of God in the anointing of
[35:20] the Holy Ghost until everything about
[35:23] you is transformed by the life of Jesus
[35:26] Christ this is a representation of
[35:29] fullness of harvest of revival a total
[35:33] submersion completely surrounded by
[35:36] God's greater glory there is there was a
[35:40] word that was given in our church some
[35:43] years ago a prophetic word that was
[35:46] recorded and it reads like this there is
[35:49] such muddy water in the prophetic
[35:52] movement today across the land but I
[35:55] desire to send a clean wave I I just say
[35:58] yes Lord
[35:59] we need a pure river a clean wave let me
[36:04] read another wave of glory will soon
[36:07] roll in pure from the thrown waters to
[36:12] swim in that was a
[36:14] fennec word of the Lord given in our
[36:17] services many years ago promising us
[36:19] that there would be another pure wave of
[36:23] water from the throne of God waters to
[36:26] swim in to be totally submerged in
[36:29] greater glory I believe that that is our
[36:34] promise and I believe that we may very
[36:39] well be entering into that season where
[36:43] we are not just up to our ankles or up
[36:46] to our knees are up to our loins but we
[36:49] are being offered an opportunity to come
[36:52] in to the deeper realms of God's Holy
[36:55] Ghost spirit His Holy Ghost power and
[36:58] what does that do it doesn't just give
[37:01] us a feeling it takes us in to greater
[37:05] depths of Revelation we are not changed
[37:09] by feeling we are not changed by
[37:11] presence we are changed by the Word of
[37:15] God as it is revealed to us by the
[37:18] Spirit if we can get in an atmosphere of
[37:21] greater glory than we are in a position
[37:25] at that moment to listen more carefully
[37:30] to discern more clearly what God's Word
[37:34] is saying to us the Bible repeats this
[37:37] phrase he that hath an ear let him hear
[37:40] what the Spirit is saying to the church
[37:44] how many of you know that that hearing
[37:46] is not just letting the sound pass
[37:49] through your ear but giving heed to a
[37:52] real listening Lord I value your word oh
[37:56] I wish that you would be able to come to
[38:00] a place that you see the importance the
[38:04] value of having a real revelation from
[38:08] the Word of God we talked about it the
[38:11] last time we were together you know you
[38:13] can you can have experience after
[38:15] experience that will bless you and and
[38:19] strengthen you encourage you but but
[38:22] mine when life gets to beating you
[38:24] around and knocking you down
[38:26] you've got to have more than the memory
[38:29] of a feeling that you had when you were
[38:31] encountering the presence of the Lord
[38:33] you've got to have some truth I tell you
[38:36] there is nothing to defeat the enemy
[38:39] like the truth of God's Word once it has
[38:42] been revealed in the hearts of men and
[38:43] women we take that then like a weapon
[38:46] and my what God can accomplish in our
[38:50] lives so don't be satisfied with one
[38:54] dimension of his anointing one level one
[38:58] place of intensity in his spirit but let
[39:02] the Spirit of God
[39:03] stir in you a hunger a desire for those
[39:08] deeper places to swim in we got to get
[39:11] help with our walk we do we've got to
[39:14] learn to walk consistently we've got to
[39:17] get help with our prayer life we've got
[39:20] to see the value of real praise and
[39:23] worship and and certainly we've got to
[39:26] have some help with our reproductive
[39:27] ability our witness has got to be a a
[39:31] and Nene we've got to be living a life
[39:34] that is so consistent with what the Word
[39:36] of God says that people see it and
[39:39] desire it and they even seek us out
[39:42] asking what's going on in your life can
[39:46] I have some of that Oh wouldn't that be
[39:48] wonderful if you walk down the high
[39:51] street and someone comes to you and
[39:53] begins to say what is that I feel when
[39:56] you pass by I'm interested in that how
[39:59] do you get some of that all that be such
[40:02] a great opportunity wouldn't it for you
[40:04] to open your mouth and let the Lord fill
[40:06] it as you begin to tell them what it
[40:09] really means to have that kind of
[40:12] experience with God that's waters to
[40:14] swim in when you get to that place where
[40:17] where your your walk is anointed your
[40:20] your prayer life and your worship life
[40:22] is in order you've got to that place
[40:24] where you're you're really reproducing
[40:27] the power of God the resurrection life
[40:28] with your own testimony and then you
[40:31] move into that place of greater glory oh
[40:34] my I believe God has some experiences
[40:39] for us in the
[40:40] word I new places of Revelation in the
[40:43] word that will will make oh what
[40:45] differences it has already made in our
[40:48] lives and what a difference it will make
[40:50] if we keep moving on don't stop don't
[40:53] stay too long where you are now keep
[40:56] reaching for the new season keep
[40:59] reaching for what God has for you in the
[41:02] next place so we not only see the
[41:04] progressions of the glory of the Spirit
[41:09] of the anointing in this experience with
[41:11] Ezekiel but we really can see it
[41:14] demonstrated in the life and ministry of
[41:17] David how David moved from one glory one
[41:22] anointing to another and each level of
[41:26] anointing brought greater glory and the
[41:29] greater glory gave him greater influence
[41:33] it also brought greater responsibility
[41:37] and I want you to know the more of God's
[41:41] glory his spirit his anointing that you
[41:45] carry in your life the greater the
[41:48] responsibility will be that accompanies
[41:51] that greater demonstration of God's
[41:54] Spirit we are more responsible the more
[41:57] of God's power the more of his anointing
[42:01] he gives us the more responsible we are
[42:04] to carefully guard and protect that
[42:07] presence to to do carefully make sure
[42:12] that we are guarding that anointing and
[42:16] that we are taking responsibility for
[42:19] the authority that comes with that
[42:20] greater glory we can't be careless I
[42:23] think we could sum this up by saying we
[42:26] can't play Church when we come into that
[42:29] place of waters to swim in when we come
[42:32] into that place of of deeper anointing
[42:35] we can't play around anymore it's it's
[42:38] serious business there is a great
[42:41] responsibility on our shoulders if we
[42:45] can identify ourselves with the Bride of
[42:47] Christ there's a great responsibility on
[42:51] our shoulders
[42:52] to walk in the truth and to carefully
[42:56] use the authority that God has given us
[42:59] there there are some teaching out there
[43:01] in the Pentecostal and charismatic world
[43:04] that is so careless when it comes to the
[43:08] anointing and the and the authority and
[43:12] the power of God in our lives and it is
[43:16] sometimes taught and and demonstrated in
[43:21] such a flippant way but I want you to
[43:24] know there's a glory presence that
[43:26] paralyzes you there is an intensity of
[43:29] God's presence where you can't I believe
[43:32] in worship I tell you I do I believe the
[43:35] Bible said dance before the Lord I
[43:37] believe in that I believe in lifting up
[43:39] my hands and giving God praise I believe
[43:43] in leaping for joy when God touches your
[43:47] life but I want you to know there's a
[43:49] place in that presence where you don't
[43:51] hardly want to breathe it's not that
[43:54] you're afraid that God is going to
[43:56] destroy you it's the fear of the Lord
[44:00] it's the reverence that reverential fear
[44:04] of the Lord that we don't want to
[44:07] disturb or take for granted what God is
[44:11] doing in our midst I've experienced that
[44:14] on on small levels at times and my I'm
[44:18] telling you I have felt like I wanted to
[44:21] get under the carpet you want to go as
[44:24] low as you possibly can you are so
[44:26] overwhelmed so overjoyed so thrilled
[44:30] that you have touched that presence of
[44:33] God and that that presence of God has
[44:36] touched you you don't want to think a
[44:38] thought that would offend that presence
[44:42] that anointing of the person of the Lord
[44:45] Jesus Christ the church has got some
[44:48] we've got some growth to do after all
[44:51] these years there are people who have so
[44:56] stressed what it means to know God is
[44:59] your father that they have created an
[45:02] atmosphere that is void of the fear of
[45:05] the Lord we can be closed we can he can
[45:09] be our Papa he can be our Heavenly
[45:12] bridegroom we can lay on his chest and
[45:15] hear his heartbeat but I want you to
[45:19] know there is a reverential fear of the
[45:21] Lord who that comes in those levels of
[45:26] God's anointing and God's presence I
[45:29] would that you could come into that
[45:31] place and experience that because for me
[45:35] to try to explain it or describe what I
[45:38] have encountered a few short times in my
[45:41] life I don't have the ability to do it
[45:44] but have you if you ever should you ever
[45:46] experience for yourself one time you
[45:50] won't have to have it explained you may
[45:52] not be able to explain it but you you
[45:54] won't have to have anybody to talk about
[45:56] it because you'll know immediately you
[45:58] know it's so impacting and so
[46:01] life-changing from Scripture we
[46:04] discovered that David had three public
[46:08] anointings and that each time that
[46:12] anointing prepared him to step deeper
[46:14] into the destiny and into the authority
[46:18] that God had chosen David to walk in
[46:21] were all three necessary absolutely let
[46:26] me ask you this was it necessary for
[46:28] Ezekiel to come to water to his ankles
[46:31] before he could get to waters to swim in
[46:33] sure he had to pass through the water as
[46:37] you keep waiting out into the water the
[46:39] waters rise and so the same thing for
[46:42] David every one of those anointings was
[46:45] necessary every one of those anointings
[46:48] released a new level of authority and
[46:51] power in David's life and it gave him
[46:55] the grace to adjust to that new place of
[47:00] responsibility that God was calling him
[47:02] to he was ultimately chosen by God to be
[47:05] king over the United house of Israel
[47:08] both Israel and Judah both north and
[47:11] south but yet there was going to be a
[47:14] journey to get him there
[47:16] he was going to have to go from
[47:18] ankle-deep water knee-deep water law in
[47:22] deep water to get to those waters to
[47:24] swim in in 1st Samuel chapter 16 and
[47:28] verse 13 then Samuel took the Horn of
[47:31] oil and anointed him in the midst of his
[47:34] brothers and the Spirit of the Lord came
[47:37] upon David from that day forward this is
[47:40] such a lovely story in the Bible what a
[47:43] beautiful reminder
[47:45] I love reflecting on this and you know
[47:48] it well Jesse had all of these sons
[47:51] Samuel the Prophet was sent by the Lord
[47:53] to the house of Jesse to anoint the next
[47:56] king of Israel he gets there and he and
[47:59] all of Jesse's sons are lined up and
[48:01] that old prophet Samuel walks by with
[48:04] the Horn of oil in his hand and he says
[48:06] nope no this looks like a good one you
[48:09] know if you read the story it looks like
[48:11] a good one the Lord said no he goes on
[48:15] to the next one and maybe Sam will face
[48:16] mine this must be the one look at this
[48:19] good strong man he looks smart he looks
[48:21] handsome the Spirit of the Lord said no
[48:24] he goes all the way down the line and
[48:27] the Lord hasn't said yes to any of the
[48:30] sons of Jesse so he says to him have you
[48:33] any more sons and justice oh yes yes in
[48:38] fact I do I have one I have one little
[48:41] son oh he's not so much you know just
[48:44] kind of a ruddy little boy he's out
[48:47] watching the Sheep samuel says call for
[48:49] him and when David is brought before the
[48:52] prophet Samuel Samuel knows with
[48:55] everything that is within him this is
[48:58] the king what about it he passed by the
[49:02] most handsome the most intellectual the
[49:05] biggest strongest all the qualifications
[49:08] that man look for in a leader and found
[49:11] this little shepherd boy and samuel just
[49:14] takes off the lid of the Horn of oil and
[49:16] He pours it over his head in the midst
[49:18] of his brethren and guess what it wasn't
[49:20] just samuel that anointed David that day
[49:24] the Spirit of the Lord came upon him in
[49:27] verse 13 from
[49:29] that day forward what was Samuel doing
[49:32] he was pouring a horn of oil on Saul's
[49:35] successor God was getting ready to bring
[49:40] an end to the house of Saul and he was
[49:43] getting ready to bring in a new ruler a
[49:46] new king for Israel and it started when
[49:49] we look at that first anointing we
[49:52] associate it with the Hebrew word souk
[49:54] which means to pour out it can
[49:58] occasionally mean to smear over it's
[50:00] only used 8 times in the Bible
[50:02] in most of those cases it speaks of that
[50:07] oil being poured over the head according
[50:11] to the theological word book of the Old
[50:14] Testament that word soup primarily means
[50:17] pour as a pouring a pouring soup differs
[50:22] from its most common synonym masa or
[50:25] that is where we get the word mashach
[50:29] where we eventually get the word mushiya
[50:32] which includes the idea of of spreading
[50:36] a little bit or smearing a little bit
[50:38] when the anointing all was poured upon
[50:40] an individual in an Old Testament
[50:42] ceremony it ran down over the surfaces
[50:45] of the body because of the beautiful
[50:48] smell that excited the senses but but
[50:51] quickly dissipated soon evaporating and
[50:54] the fragrance quickly dwindled Psalm 133
[50:58] one speaks about what an anointing would
[51:00] have looked like behold how good and how
[51:03] pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
[51:05] together in unity and it talks about the
[51:08] oil that ran down Aaron's beard all the
[51:12] way down to the bottoms of his garment
[51:15] he was being covered in the anointing it
[51:19] was oil symbolizing spirit it flowed
[51:23] down covering the whole man this was
[51:27] really but the beginning of David's
[51:29] journey it was under this initial
[51:32] enabling this initial anointing that
[51:35] David killed both the lion and the bear
[51:38] so that first anointing that David
[51:41] Seve was good enough it was sufficient
[51:44] enough potent enough that he killed the
[51:47] lion in the bear it was under that same
[51:49] anointing just the first one that David
[51:53] killed Goliath and we know that David
[51:56] was less than 20 at that time because he
[52:00] was considered too young to fight the
[52:03] scripture says it and many people who
[52:06] have studied the life of David and tried
[52:08] to put it in some sort of timeline
[52:10] believe that David was about 17 years
[52:12] old when he killed Goliath that was a
[52:15] great anointing it was powerful enough
[52:19] to give him courage over the line in the
[52:21] bear to kill them and it gave him
[52:24] courage to slay the the Philistine giant
[52:27] Goliath who was tormenting harassing and
[52:32] mocking the armies of God but it did not
[52:35] immediately place David on the throne
[52:37] with full Dominion and full power over
[52:40] the promised territory and the jura
[52:43] ditch jurisdiction that would be a part
[52:45] of his destiny David would greatly need
[52:48] this anointing and enabling for the
[52:52] wilderness experience that was about to
[52:54] lay before him I want you to know after
[52:56] great victory David was going to know
[53:00] great wilderness he had known great
[53:03] plenty and power but he was about to
[53:07] know real heartache and real fear
[53:12] it was certainly going to try to take
[53:15] ahold of David's life it was evident
[53:18] that in order for David to rule over the
[53:21] United Kingdom of Israel something
[53:23] deeper was going to be needed to carry
[53:25] him farther toward God's ultimate plan
[53:28] for his life what was he going to need
[53:30] he was going to need a new encounter
[53:33] with God's presence he was going to need
[53:36] a new anointing he was going to need to
[53:39] move from the ankle deep to the knee
[53:41] deep to the loin deep to waters to swim
[53:44] in and I would dare say I believed I
[53:48] would be safe to say that if you are a
[53:50] son of God
[53:51] servant of the Lord Jesus Christ you're
[53:54] going to also need I'm going to also
[53:57] need more anointing fresh encounter with
[54:03] God's presence to prepare me for
[54:06] whatever it is that stands between my
[54:09] life now and the the promise of rapture
[54:14] resurrection I want to work for the Lord
[54:17] the rest of the days that I have on this
[54:19] earth I want to be able to do it with
[54:23] the best of my ability but I'm going to
[54:26] be depending more and more on his
[54:28] anointing and power so I have to journey
[54:31] on toward the fresh anointing especially
[54:34] when I'm moving into new seasons and
[54:37] into New Territories I want to pray for
[54:39] you the next time we come together we'll
[54:43] talk about the other two anointings in
[54:46] the life of David and how each one took
[54:49] him a little closer and a little closer
[54:51] until finally he stepped into the
[54:54] fullness of all that God wanted him to
[54:56] be you see you've been in preparation
[54:59] your life thus far has been a place of
[55:04] training and preparation for what God
[55:08] wants to use you for John the Baptist
[55:10] spent all those years in the wilderness
[55:12] getting ready for that few seconds of
[55:16] ministry when he would carry out the
[55:19] most important part of his destiny on
[55:21] earth and that was that beautiful day on
[55:24] the banks of the Jordan River when Jesus
[55:27] his cousin came to be baptized but it
[55:30] wasn't just his cousin that was coming
[55:32] it was so much more than that in John he
[55:36] didn't greet his cousin hey cuz I'm glad
[55:38] you've come today or no he said behold
[55:41] the lamb of God which taketh away the
[55:45] sins of the world this was an important
[55:48] part I believe the most important part
[55:52] of the life and Ministry of John the
[55:54] Baptist to forerun the first coming of
[55:57] the Lord Jesus Christ to announce he's
[56:00] more than a man
[56:02] this is the son of God that has come to
[56:05] take away the sins of the world all of
[56:08] the years of training in the wilderness
[56:10] preparing him hardship hard-knocks
[56:14] preparing him and getting ready I'm
[56:16] ready for that few moments of ministry
[56:19] your life is being formed if you have
[56:21] surrendered if you have surrendered to
[56:24] the call of the Lord Jesus Christ your
[56:27] life is being prepared even now I'm so
[56:29] sorry for your pain
[56:31] I'm so sorry for many of the things that
[56:34] you have had to walk through in your
[56:36] life and I know that there have been
[56:38] many tears and there has been much
[56:40] betrayal and there has been much loss
[56:43] how do you know brother Shelly how do
[56:46] you know because that has been my life
[56:48] as a child of God called at an early age
[56:52] even before I was born to preach the
[56:54] gospel and my life has been full of
[56:57] disappointment and heartache and
[56:59] betrayal but I want you to know those
[57:02] rough moments those dark moments have
[57:06] made the glorious moments even more
[57:09] precious to encounter his love in those
[57:13] dark times to know how much he loved me
[57:16] and cared for me to pick me up and take
[57:18] me forward that has been part of the
[57:21] grace that has brought me to this day
[57:23] and I know that you have continued to
[57:26] journey forward because of God's grace
[57:28] lord I ask you to strengthen those who
[57:31] are watching this program we don't like
[57:33] some of the things that we have been

[57:39] preparation for greater glory we embrace
[57:43] it right now in fact we say thank you

[58:02] you for it in the name of the Lord Jesus
