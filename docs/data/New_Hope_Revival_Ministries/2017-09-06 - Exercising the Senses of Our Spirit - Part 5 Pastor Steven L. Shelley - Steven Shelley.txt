TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the program today as we do each and every week and I want to tell you what a privilege I consider it to be to be able to come into your home or wherever you're watching this program either on the television or perhaps you're streaming on the world wide web you might even be watching it as a podcast or on a DVD but however you're connected with us today I certainly want to tell you I considered a privilege to be able to declare to you the good news that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever he changes not and what he was able to do what he performed two thousand years ago when he walked the shores of Galilee in his earthly body I'm glad to know that he's still able to do the very same thing today in fact great miracles signs and wonders demonstrations of God's saving power and healing power are breaking out all over the world as you view this program today there is a great stirring in the earth shiftings in the heavenly places God's pouring out his spirit and I believe that we're gearing up for the manifestation of many of the things you've heard us teaching about on this program over the past few years and I just pray that you'll be able to enter right into the study with us today we're in a series on exercising our spiritual senses we've been speaking a lot about Adam last week we were really talking about the the development of the human spirit and how that by the new birth are our fallen spirit is being regenerated we have that promise when we are born again but it requires development and the exercising of our spiritual senses and we showed it to your right in the scripture in fact we're going to go back and look at that real quick before we move on into what we want to share today so please contact our ministry if you have any prayer requests that you'd like for us to join in faith with you and pray believing God for the answer please send the men all of the contact information is given to you on the screen and we would consider it a great privilege to be able to stand with you in this hour in prayer so let's look right to the Word of God today shall we do that we were reading I think the last verse of scripture that we were looking at one of the last was Revelation chapter 30 verse 21 and all of this kind of came out though of another interesting verse of scripture that I've ministered on many times over the years from the book of Hebrews and I don't think it would be a bad idea if we just went back and read that again Hebrews chapter five verse eight and nine we're speaking about the Ministry of Mashiach the Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ and the Apostle is speaking here in verse eight though he were a son it's indisputable that he was the son of God though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered he learned that total walk of surrendered obedience by the things that he suffered while in his earthly body verse 9 says and being made perfect again a process the process of perfection being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him the point that we were making and we want to just sort of reshare that on today's broadcast is if this walk of obedience this place of surrendered surrendered life coming into oneness with the father as Jesus was able to say to those who were standing around when you've seen me you've seen the father if this was a process for the Lord Jesus Christ then I believe we are safe to see in the scripture that it is a process for you and I as well Romans 8 29 said for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed again the word conformed speaks of that molding that shaping that honing in to the image of his son of course the enemy is always there to say look you blew it you messed up you're starting from scratch but I want to tell you something that when we do fail and when we do allow the enemy to have access to our spiritual man to our inner being through temptation or whatever he he puts out in front of us if we yield and if we fail we need to come back quickly to the throne of grace we need to repent of what we have yielded to how we have allowed the enemy to operate in our lives we need to pick right up from where we left off and go on we need to press first Peter 1 and 2 we spoke about that elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit now this is a part of what we're talking about exercising those those spiritual gifts that God is placed in our life those senses that we might sanctify our spirit man and listening how its worded here elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit through the purification that word sanctification to purify to set apart and in this particular reference it also is the word holiness through holiness of the Spirit this is God releasing over our human spirit his holiness which sets us apart which purifies us which filters out all that the enemy is trying to to penetrate our spirit with from the realm of the soul and from the realm of the flesh according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit to obedience again here's disobedience that God is calling us to and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ now this conformed to his image what does that look like it's spiritual maturity it's what Peter talked about the stature of a perfect man and perfection is a spiritual process we are being made perfect I think one of the last things that we spoke about was the fact that the scripture says we are called to be partakers we are called to be partakers of the divine nature and I really believe that these are keys that God wants to use in our life in this hour to bring us to that place when we come short of what God is asking us to do we are forgiven through the blood of Jesus and then we can move again toward the goal and we read some of those scriptures about pressing toward the mark of the upward call in Christ Jesus and then revelation 321 to him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and then sat down with my father in his throne we talked about the scripture in Matthew 22 14 for many are called but few are chosen now just to review a moment we've been teaching that man was created to function on two levels of life the earthly life the earthly realm the atmosphere around us and the heavenly realm the spirit realm we we talked about Genesis 27 how that the Lord breathed how God Almighty breathed into the nostrils of Adam the breath of life in Hebrew that is lives and man became a living soul the plurality of this word lives means that by the breath of God Adam received both soul life and spirit life it's a very very interesting thing Adam was in great harmony because of this because he was made in the image and the likeness of the triune God odd because adam ins himself was a try Unity body soul and spirit we find that he was very much in connection with nature he was very connected with his earthly environment and with other living creatures are the creations that God had made and I want us to look at that for a little bit today in Genesis chapter 2 verses 19 through 20 at this we're not approaching this as only a historical fact or truth in the life of Adam we're looking at this to see if there's anything in this that would be a part of our inheritance for today and I believe it is I believe that this connection that Adam enjoyed with his environment is part of our inheritance as believers and as we come into that place of divine alignment with him where we communicate with our Creator as Adam did in the Garden of Eden and that wasn't flesh to spirit that wasn't sold to spirit how was it that Adam communicated with God in the cool of the day in the Garden of Eden he communicated spirit to spirit and as we begin to exercise the senses of our human spirit bringing us into tandem into connection with our Heavenly Father and with His Holy Spirit I believe we're going to be able to see a greater connection in our life so that we come to that place of walking in Dominion as Adam was called to walk in the original mandate what was God's original mandate for mankind it was that Adam have dominion over all the creations that God had made the fish in the sea the animals plant kingdom life all of these things he was to have dominion now let's look at Genesis 2 verses 19 and 20 and I like these verses and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them now in that amazing the God of all creation who had made all of these magnificent diverse colorful wonderful creatures and yet he brought them he he rounded them up and brought them to Adam to see what Adam would name the animals how is it that God could trust Adam with such a task well let's read on and whatever or whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof I want you to see the level of trust now most of you have created something in your life you've written something you've built something you've painted something you've made something and you know how protective we can be over what we create how protective we can be even you've had an idea on your job or something along those lines and you know how protective you feel it's an amazing thing to me that Almighty God would have released such a big responsibility to Adam how could he do that because he had total complete trust in Adam and he rightfully so because Adam and his creator were communicating with such oneness spirit to spirit that God knew everything there was about Adam he knew that place of intimacy that Adam was walking in with him and so it really it was the mind of God functioning through Adam in other words whatever God would have named the animal that's what Adam named the animal Adam was operating out of that place of relationship that he had with the Creator so much so that Adam was not thinking his own thoughts he was connected spirit to spirit to the Almighty Creator so he was thinking God's thoughts he wasn't speaking his words he wasn't pulling some name out of a hat making up some kind of strange word and calling an elephant an elephant and a lion a lion he literally was reading the mind of God he was speaking the mind of God what if i told you that i believe that is a part of the inheritance of the overcoming company in this hour i believe that god wants to bring us to a place where we are so transformed by the renewing of our mind and remember we told you last week that the mind and the spirit two different words describing the same part of man the spirit and the mind very very connected we spoke about it we gave you some understanding of that I hope and so it's our mind being transformed by renewal so our spirit is also being transformed by renewal by exercising what God has placed within us to bring us to that walk of obedience so that we live our lives not out of the flesh not out of the soul but out of the spirit so here was Adam looking at the animals thinking God's thoughts and calling them what God would have called them naming them what God would have named them and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found a helpmeet for him so here is Adam everything has its pair everything has its companion but as of yet Adam had no companion so what did God do he reached inside of Adam because remember the scripture tells us that Adam was made originally both male and female there was a feminist part inside of Adam God reached in from Adam and pulled out his help meet and this is a beautiful type of what has happened with the with the crucifixion of Christ at Calvary it was like the father God was reaching inside of Jesus and pulling out his companion his bride there is a oneness there is a union there is a communion that is our inheritance and I will not be satisfied until i come personally into that place where my thoughts are so submitted I've won the victory in the realm of my flesh I've won the victory in the realm of my soul that's what I'm after so that my spirit man my mind has been so transformed and renewed by the power of God that I'm not thinking my thoughts it's not my will my desire but it's his will his desire and what's so powerful about that is if my words are laid aside and I begin to speak his words the words of God what do we know about the Word of God we know their life we know that in the words of God there is life and not only live there is creative life creative life the creative Word of God so that we're given dominion over everything every circumstance now we talked about Adam being very in tune with nature him being very in tune with his earthly environment I'm thinking about our Lord Jesus Christ in the boat asleep a storm comes up and he his disciples wake him up Master don't you care that we're going to perish and he gets up he puts his foot up on the bow of the boat he stretches forth his hands he says peace be still this is a beautiful example of God man here our Lord Jesus who was God yet in a fleshly body is tired it's making a journey across the the Sea of Galilee he is fallen asleep in the bow of the boat very a very display a very big display or a display of his humanity now he puts his foot on the bow the boat peace be still and guess what the winds and the waves obey his will what is that a display of not his humanity his divinity he is now displaying that He is God God in a fleshly body what if i told you again that i believe that is a part of our inheritance that God wants you and I functioning in that authority and in that Dominion where that we could literally speak by the power of the spoken word and calm the storm somebody said well I think that's just a grandiose thought and it's not likely to be carried out well I want you to know in token form it has already happened in the earth and is happening in the lives of believers who are going after it sometimes the the biggest part of why we don't see these things it's because people don't realize that it's available it's for them and they can go after it and I'm not going to be satisfied with a nominal Christian life I'm not going to be satisfied with just church anity I think I mentioned this in an earlier broadcast I don't believe God is a God who dangled the carrot before our nose knowing that we'll never be able to eat it I believe if we read it in the book as a divine promise for the end time all we have to do is look around and see if we're living in the generation of the end time and it doesn't take a very careful examination to see that the signs of the times are telling us that we're living in that last cycle we're living in that season at least in the season of the coming of the Lord and so these scriptures and promises that relate to this generation to this time then we certainly can claim them as our own and it is a process but we're pushing and we're leaning in and we're pressing forward until we see the fullness of this in our life now I've got a couple testimonies that I'd like to share with you about men of God who walked in at least a measure of this spirit to spirit communication and communion and oneness with God they became tokens of what is available for you and I I believe the men i'm going to speak about our we're firstfruits I believe they represent the fact to us that we can have this same kind of thing in our own life the same manifestation I'm familiar i've spent a mini year studying the ministry of a great healing evangelist profit that God mightily used in the 50s and 60s his name was William Branham and there's a couple testimonies from his life that stand out about how God used him to have communication and to have even dominion over the animal kingdom and he's telling a story here and I'm going to read it in his words it's it's uh it's Kentucky English but if you listen to this program you ought to be familiar with that anyway so I'm going to share it with you he said last summer my yard needed mowing real bad I couldn't get anybody in the morning I was home on a little vacation and two weeks I hadn't got out in the front yard with a little power motor put on my overalls and run out started mowing the yard and first thing you know a little old power motor somebody come in and I slip around back and change my clothes run in to pray for them then change again and go out and try to cut the grass again he said he'd been almost two weeks the grass had grown up so I got around behind the house where nobody could see me took off my shirt had my overalls and shoes on real hot and I was mowing I forgot about a little old Martin box that I had and that's a that's a kind of bird purple martin and there was a bunch of Hornets that had gone in that birdhouse and I'd forgotten about it and I hit against the fence and bumped that bird box and all of a sudden I was covered with Hornets you know what that is it's it's a flying insect like a wasp but but Hornets have very very powerful stingers in fact people have died and some of you will know that even in your different parts of the world that you can be attacked by Hornets and died there's a lot of poison in their sting he said I was just covered over with Hornets and I said I got to get out of here but I couldn't get away from him they were covering my body he said here's what I said now little Hornets I love you doesn't that sound silly doesn't that sound strange how did he know to say such a thing i believe it was thinking his thoughts i believe it was thinking God's thoughts I believe it was his mind was being renewed and he was beginning to think the thoughts of the Lord and he said little Hornets I love you and and I don't want you kissing me right now I want to go right on back to what I'm doing and I want you to go right back into your nest where you belong I'm God's servant and I've been praying for the sick and and I haven't had time to cut the grass so I'm out here cutting the grass I want you to go along now and get away from me I'm not scared of you because I just don't have time to do to fool with you right now go right back he said and I'm just gonna keep on mowing he said God is my judge every one of those Hornets just line right up one right after another and went right back in that box as pretty as you could see now I tell you I can see that there might be circumstances in life where that's the kind of gift we want operating in our life the Apostle Paul had that kind of gift we heard about his shipwreck we heard how the serpent came and got out of the fire bit his hand you know they're building a fire come out of the wood bit his hand and all of a sudden he's a thief and and and the the judgment of the gods are upon him and this serpent this poisonous Vipers bit him and the next thing you know the Bible said he just shook that serpent off in the fire and the same ones that had just called him a thief and a murderer now they called him a god how was he able to do that so that the poison didn't kill him because he was walking in the authority of Jesus Christ we need to come into that place of surrender listen this is something we we pull out of our pocket when we need it this is something we need to be walking in this is something we want to live in we want to function in not tuck away and pull it out every now and again in case if we get in a bind but I want to walk in that divine alignment where my spirit is communicating with his spirit and then brother branham tells another story that I like about a bool and and and how that the Lord used him there he said I I started across a field let's see if I i can get it just to the right place he said I was going over the hill to pray for a sick man he was a game warden at the time and we're supposed to take a gun but you wouldn't go to pray for a sick man with a gun in your in your holster so I took the gun and laid it a little truck and crossed over the field I was way out in the field and I forgot about the fact that in that field there was a bull that was known to be a killer he just killed an african-american man a colored man on the farm mr. Burke's just about three months before that and they had sold that bull up there to these people that had this particular kind of cattle and I've seen that bull in that field the variable that he knew had killed a man just a few months before but he forgot about it he said it was easier to cross the field to get to where he was going to pray and he said I got out in the middle of that field in about 30 yards from me this big old bull raised up his head and threw his horns down let out a big old bellow if you know what I'm talking about he said then Bighorns just shining up in the air and I looked to see if I could find a tree to climb up in but there was no tree and I knew that that bull could outrun me to the fence so I thought well this is it there's no telling what's going to happen to me and he said something happened all of a sudden he said I just began to to feel something and all of a sudden all the fear he said I had a rush of fear and then all of a sudden the fear just lifted and I wasn't scared of that bull he said I felt sorry that I had to stir of the bull there the bull was eating and minding his business I'd come traipsing through his field now he was all worked up pawing the ground letting out a bellow and he said I was in his field he was supposed to be out there laying around doing nothing and really I was bothering him now think about that he said Here Come this bull toward me as hard as he could come with his head down he was ready to pierce me right through with those horns but he said I wasn't any more afraid of that bull then I would be of any of these brothers and sisters sitting around here he ran within about five foot of me and stopped he looked at me so depleted and I said to him fellow I'm so sorry I disturbed you now you're God's creature and I'm God's servant now the Creator that made you made me and I'm his servant I'm on a journey across this hill to pray for a sick man and I'm so sorry that I disturbed you so now in the name of Jesus Christ your Creator go back and lay down and he said the bull looked at me a few minutes turned around walked over and laid down and I stood there with tears running down my eyes he was amazed at and listen it was the love of God dropped down into brother branham's heart the love of God and he began to love that creature those Hornets that bull like God who made them love them and I want you to know that when love is projected grace takes over when when we let love project from our lives God's divine love grace comes rushing in to meet the challenge perhaps some of you have heard of a of a man that was mightily used of God somewhat of a mystic in in Christianity many years ago he was baptized into the church of england in 1905 his name was sadhu sundar Singh I know many of you who are watching this program in India and some of her neighboring countries will certainly have heard of sadhu sundar Singh he disappeared in april of 1929 while undertaking a very strenuous work in Tibet and he was certainly used of the Lord in wonderful ways here's a testimony quickly you know what I'm looking down and my time is gone I'm not going to be able to share this story with you about Seto sadhu sundar Singh so I'm going to leave you hanging that's going to be my carrot you're gonna have to tune in again on the next broadcast and I'll finish this testimony and I'll try to bring it up to date let you know why I believe God wants us to come into that place father I just asked right now that you would bless those who are watching this program that you would release your Holy Spirit into their lives that you would stir up a hunger create an interest O Lord that develops into passion so that we can chase after you so that we can I a father we don't want to live below our means we don't want to live below our privileges but we want to come into the fullness of everything you have for us in in this world and in the world to come we want to be in divine alignment we want body soul and spirit to be exactly functioning as you created it to function and Lord we want you to give us that authority and Dominion we want to walk in that before your throne father we just thank you for what you're doing I feel your Healing Touch going out right now for those that are sick and afflicted we ask for these things according to your promises in the wonderful name of your shoe of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen I sure do appreciate you watching the Eagles cry today I hope I've got your interest anyway and your tune in again next week to hear this great testimony of how God worked in the life of sadhu sundar Singh may God bless you bye bye for now [Music] you [Music] you [Music]
