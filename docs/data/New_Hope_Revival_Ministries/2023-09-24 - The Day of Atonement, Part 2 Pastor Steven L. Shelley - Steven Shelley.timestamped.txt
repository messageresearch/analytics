[44:14] stream we have come to give God the
[44:17] praise and the glory that is due his
[44:20] name in the good times and in the bad
[44:22] times he is worthy of our praise and we
[44:25] want to give him the worthy praise that
[44:27] he deserves and we have come to hear the
[44:30] word and we are thankful that God has
[44:34] let us have eyes to see and ears to hear
[44:38] that we can keep marching forward toward
[44:42] the end of time and see the
[44:45] manifestation of the sons of God that we

[45:40] hallelujah
[45:45] oh blessed be the name of the Lord
[45:48] so we want to receive the tithe and the
[45:50] offering today we want you to give as
[45:52] giving unto the Lord we're running a bit
[45:54] short on the insurance and so if you
[45:57] have some extra that you would let the
[46:00] Lord speak to you and you'd sow into the
[46:02] kingdom of God for the insurance on this
[46:05] property you see every building that we
[46:07] have has to be insured and and besides
[46:11] insurance
[46:12] we now have to have a coverage with the
[46:16] Lee County Fire Department
[46:18] they want to know every square foot that
[46:20] we have that needs to be protected
[46:23] by the fire department and so there is a
[46:27] price to pay for that it's just recently
[46:29] till the uh it's just come to us that
[46:33] we've got to pay this fee to the uh to
[46:36] the fire department to for for com
[46:38] because it's commercial and so we had to
[46:41] go measure every structure to make sure
[46:43] that we were being fair with them and so
[46:48] all of it and so uh these are expenses
[46:53] but God gave it to us and we have been
[46:58] called here to work together and so we
[47:01] want together to see this all taken care
[47:05] of the insurance very expensive and as
[47:08] you know with your own homeowners
[47:10] insurance because the price of materials
[47:12] has gone up the price of insurances have
[47:15] gone up all of these things contribute
[47:17] but I'm so thankful that my papa my papa
[47:21] knows how to provide and if we commit
[47:23] ourselves to him he'll take good care of
[47:26] us he won't leave us destitute he won't
[47:29] leave us hungry he won't leave us out in
[47:32] the cold he'll take care of us if we'll
[47:35] commit our ways to the Lord he will take
[47:37] good care of us so brother Elias and
[47:40] brother Austin Yantis will you two
[47:42] brothers go to the people today for the
[47:44] tithe and the offering we bless you in
[47:47] the name of the Lord as you give to the
[47:48] Lord we're going to let sister Jaya sing

[58:49] praise God
[58:50] [Applause]
[58:52] praise God
[58:54] praise the Lord
[58:57] Hallelujah
[59:00] Hallelujah
[59:03] you may be seated today
[59:06] it's wonderful to be in the house of the
[59:08] Lord
[59:09] and we have quite a few missing this
[59:12] morning and sometimes as I said to the
[59:15] folks in the back as we're praying for
[59:18] the service we have to work a little
[59:20] harder to make up for those who are
[59:22] unable to be here but thank you so much
[59:24] for being faithful today and thank you
[59:27] for taking praise and worship serious it
[59:31] is very very very very very serious and
[59:34] thank you for taking it as such uh we
[59:38] have had a a busy week and a trying week
[59:42] but God is faithful this morning he
[59:46] never leaves us he never forsakes us uh
[59:50] he is yes and amen
[59:53] and I I I maybe I repeat it too often in
[59:57] my prayers I if there's one thing I
[1:00:00] don't like I I maybe I'll just Express
[1:00:03] one of my pet peeves
[1:00:05] when people pray and I hear them pray
[1:00:07] publicly if they're leading us in prayer
[1:00:09] it really disturbs me when I hear people
[1:00:12] say lord lord lord lord lord lord
[1:00:15] Our Father father father father
[1:00:17] I don't ever want to be guilty of a vain
[1:00:20] repetition
[1:00:21] when we use the name of the Lord we're
[1:00:24] supposed to attach Faith to it every
[1:00:26] time
[1:00:27] so so if we get shocked and we say Lord
[1:00:31] you better be sure that you're putting
[1:00:33] Faith with that Lord
[1:00:34] you're calling on him to help you
[1:00:36] otherwise you're using his name in vain
[1:00:39] I don't want to do that I maybe I have
[1:00:42] another vain repetition because I often
[1:00:45] say God you are sovereign and you are
[1:00:47] God's Supreme I don't mean that to be a
[1:00:50] repetition but I find myself saying it
[1:00:52] more and more I have to be reminded that
[1:00:55] he is Sovereign he didn't he doesn't owe
[1:00:58] me any explanation
[1:01:01] I know inquiring minds want to know
[1:01:04] but he doesn't owe me any explanation
[1:01:07] he is Sovereign in all of his ways he is
[1:01:10] God's Supreme there are there are there
[1:01:13] are there's no other God among the gods
[1:01:15] the Bible says among all the gods that
[1:01:18] people worship there's only one true
[1:01:20] Living God
[1:01:21] and uh he never makes a mistake and we
[1:01:25] come to realize that in the difficult
[1:01:27] times as well as in the beautiful and
[1:01:31] amazing times let me get this out of the
[1:01:34] way uh because we want to move on to
[1:01:37] something else before we approach the
[1:01:38] word uh tomorrow uh well let me first
[1:01:42] say today is Sister Rona Ryder's
[1:01:45] birthday and they are streaming the
[1:01:48] service from Cape Town South Africa and
[1:01:51] we want to wish our sister Rona a happy
[1:01:53] happy birthday and I haven't had any
[1:01:57] other uh news or confirmation except
[1:02:01] that you all were hoping to be here and
[1:02:03] I hope I'm going to see you in a few
[1:02:05] weeks I hope we get to give you a a
[1:02:07] handshake a hug for happy birthday but
[1:02:10] if not then know that we're thinking
[1:02:12] about you in Cape Town today and
[1:02:14] appreciate your love for us and for this
[1:02:16] ministry tomorrow is Cynthia Symphony
[1:02:21] Symphony she has a new name Cindy and
[1:02:25] Anthony's wedding anniversary I I
[1:02:28] realize that it's been many years since
[1:02:31] they have been able to be in service
[1:02:32] with us but they are a faithful part of
[1:02:35] this church I hear from Sister Cindy
[1:02:38] every week I know that they're there
[1:02:40] they support this church and we love
[1:02:43] them very very much both of them and we
[1:02:47] want to wish them a very happy wedding
[1:02:49] anniversary
[1:02:51] on Monday
[1:02:53] and just thank the Lord for that uh
[1:02:58] Tuesday
[1:03:01] I have written down
[1:03:03] April oh
[1:03:06] I was about to really get confused April
[1:03:08] I was wondering why I wrote down the
[1:03:11] month instead of a name oh my I was
[1:03:14] fixing to check myself
[1:03:16] because I put Tuesday April and then a
[1:03:19] year which I'm not going to name the
[1:03:21] year
[1:03:22] but I had written that down in my notes
[1:03:24] I better pay attention to what I'm doing
[1:03:25] had my Tuesday is April's birthday she
[1:03:29] happens to share her name with the month
[1:03:31] uh would you all wish her a happy
[1:03:33] birthday today
[1:03:39] Wednesday is Sister Cheryl Hawk's
[1:03:42] birthday and although they have a church
[1:03:43] they are very very faithful streamers in
[1:03:47] Tucson and we love them very much and I
[1:03:49] happen to see her so I will uh wish her
[1:03:52] a happy birthday as well and then Friday
[1:03:55] night is uh is heir of Sukkot and so
[1:04:00] that is the evening that begins uh
[1:04:04] Sukkot or Tabernacles time and I think
[1:04:07] most of you know that this evening as
[1:04:09] the sun goes down uh Yom Kippur or the
[1:04:12] day of atonement begins and we'll
[1:04:15] Minister a little bit about that in just
[1:04:17] a few minutes for those of you who who
[1:04:20] are not here Tuesday night uh and
[1:04:24] especially after the service we shared a
[1:04:26] few things with you uh concerning sister
[1:04:29] Royale and uh her health has not been
[1:04:33] good for some time now but she received
[1:04:36] a diagnosis this week that none of us
[1:04:39] really expected and uh that was that she
[1:04:43] has cancer in the bone and it has spread
[1:04:47] quite rapidly and uh to to many places
[1:04:51] in her body and that was only on the
[1:04:54] first part of the week Monday is when we
[1:04:57] went there with the family to share with
[1:04:58] them the news and then on Friday uh she
[1:05:03] really had a rough day a horrible day
[1:05:06] and it was very very hard to be with her
[1:05:09] and to see her in that condition and so
[1:05:12] nauseated from the pain medication uh
[1:05:15] and you know to see her vomiting and and
[1:05:18] and just struggling really struggling
[1:05:21] and and yet in in pain
[1:05:25] uh even with the with the medication so
[1:05:29] the family reached out to see what they
[1:05:31] might be able to do because uh without a
[1:05:34] without a further diagnosis to know
[1:05:37] where the cancer might have started
[1:05:40] um it's a little bit hard to know what
[1:05:42] they're dealing with and uh she's
[1:05:44] certainly not able to go through
[1:05:46] anything like that any further testing
[1:05:48] so on Friday she was transferred Friday
[1:05:51] evening to the hospice house in Columbus
[1:05:54] and it has been a wonderful blessing uh
[1:05:59] because they are able to control as much
[1:06:01] as possible the symptoms of the vomiting
[1:06:04] the nausea and control the pain and so
[1:06:08] she's resting she rested uh pretty good
[1:06:11] last night every couple hours she would
[1:06:14] stir for just a little bit and uh there
[1:06:18] will be confusion that goes along with
[1:06:20] the medication and she really needs our
[1:06:24] prayers I plan to to go there this
[1:06:26] afternoon late and and see her we asked
[1:06:29] Mary Beth today because she and
[1:06:31] Annabelle are are doing a a wonderful
[1:06:34] job in helping take care of sister
[1:06:36] Royale and sister Weems was there all
[1:06:39] day yesterday yesterday
[1:06:41] and we asked Mary Beth what would be the
[1:06:45] best way to approach visitors and at
[1:06:49] this time they're not going to receive
[1:06:52] visitors at the hospice other than the
[1:06:55] immediate family and that is simply
[1:06:58] because
[1:06:59] she needs as much rest as she possibly
[1:07:02] can she's not recognizing everything
[1:07:05] that's going on or everyone that is
[1:07:07] coming in and there are other ways that
[1:07:10] we can express our love for sister Weems
[1:07:14] we have to make sure that she's eating
[1:07:16] like a queen because she needs her
[1:07:19] strength and so anything that we can do
[1:07:22] for her for Hawk and meribeth as well
[1:07:25] who we're loaning loaning Hawk an extra
[1:07:29] vehicle of ours today my wife's vehicle
[1:07:31] because it's been hard going and
[1:07:33] dropping off and and coming back and
[1:07:36] forth in the morning and in the evening
[1:07:38] and in the night and uh they are having
[1:07:42] to scrape around to try to feed
[1:07:44] themselves while while also being there
[1:07:47] as much as possible I know I'm
[1:07:49] stammering around forgive me I I'm just
[1:07:52] laying it out the best I can if you want
[1:07:54] to do something for them uh it would be
[1:07:57] amazing they might need a babysitter
[1:08:00] sometime they might need uh might be
[1:08:03] nice to have a gift card to grab a meal
[1:08:06] or put something in the refrigerator for
[1:08:09] them to have later
[1:08:11] all we know is that God is sovereign
[1:08:14] and God is supreme
[1:08:16] many years ago you know that there was a
[1:08:19] vision of the platform down here under
[1:08:21] the Tabernacle and I saw Royale walking
[1:08:24] unhindered without any any limitations
[1:08:27] to her body and uh she claimed that and
[1:08:31] has claimed that her entire life here as
[1:08:35] a promise from the Lord that she would
[1:08:37] get her healing and I'm here to tell you
[1:08:40] she will
[1:08:41] she will she will either the angel of
[1:08:45] the Lord will either go by and visit her
[1:08:47] at the hospice house and bring her out
[1:08:49] and I know what your carnal mind is
[1:08:53] telling you but it lies
[1:08:55] it lies
[1:08:58] I I will tell you this I would not be
[1:09:02] completely shocked if the phone call
[1:09:05] came and said come get her
[1:09:07] you know he is so able
[1:09:10] he's so able
[1:09:13] I I uh hesitate to even share those I
[1:09:16] have those thoughts but I hesitate to
[1:09:19] share them because some people see
[1:09:21] things like that as giving people a
[1:09:23] false hope or something you know they
[1:09:25] say say it like that if you've got hope
[1:09:27] in the doctors it's false
[1:09:30] because they'll surely failure they're
[1:09:32] just humans and remember they're
[1:09:34] practicing medicine they're wonderful to
[1:09:37] have around when you need them but
[1:09:39] they're practicing but if you have hope
[1:09:41] in the Lord you're never disappointed
[1:09:43] you're never disappointed because she's
[1:09:46] either going to receive her complete and
[1:09:49] total healing unhindered and unable to
[1:09:52] walk to I mean completely able to walk
[1:09:55] around without pain you know she had the
[1:09:58] replacement and then she had had the
[1:10:00] stroke and she's not going in the right
[1:10:03] direction for for that to take place but
[1:10:06] God knows how to come even in the
[1:10:08] Midnight Hour she's either going to get
[1:10:10] a whole body here or a whole body there
[1:10:14] and as recently as Monday night when we
[1:10:17] were sharing with her the news can you
[1:10:20] imagine seeing your whole family come in
[1:10:22] and your pastor and his wife come in all
[1:10:24] at one time it it couldn't be real good
[1:10:26] but she had the sweetest spirit
[1:10:29] and she said I'm not worried and I'm not
[1:10:32] scared that was the first words that
[1:10:34] come out of her mouth now that's
[1:10:36] pretty impressive
[1:10:38] you've just told someone that the that
[1:10:41] there's cancer in the chest bone in the
[1:10:44] thoracic and the lumbar spine that means
[1:10:46] the upper spine and the and the bottom
[1:10:49] of the spine and in the skull and they
[1:10:52] say I'm not worried and I'm not scared
[1:10:54] only faith in a genuine God could say
[1:10:57] something like that
[1:10:59] and uh later she said I was just
[1:11:02] thinking today I have a promise and I'm
[1:11:04] holding on to that promise if it doesn't
[1:11:07] turn out the way that we want it we in
[1:11:10] in reflecting and seeing that in my mind
[1:11:13] her walking across that platform my
[1:11:15] logical uh interpretation and thought
[1:11:18] would be well in order for that to come
[1:11:20] to pass she has to physically walk
[1:11:22] across that platform but my spiritual
[1:11:25] mind and my faith tells me that that God
[1:11:28] knew when he gave that exactly how it
[1:11:31] would be and she will either do it in a
[1:11:34] restored physical body or she'll do it
[1:11:37] in a glorified theophany body but she
[1:11:40] will receive her healing I am convinced
[1:11:43] of that 100 percent
[1:11:45] but you need to know that her condition
[1:11:47] is grave and that it has happened so
[1:11:50] quickly the very fact that doctors had
[1:11:53] no idea what was going on uh until until
[1:11:57] really a diagnosis only came Monday lets
[1:12:00] me know that God God knew this he had
[1:12:03] this in his mind there's a reason why uh
[1:12:07] it didn't come earlier that would have
[1:12:10] perhaps been a uh a desire for us for
[1:12:14] her to fight that and that would have
[1:12:16] been all kinds of of radiation and all
[1:12:19] kinds of chemotherapy and all kinds of
[1:12:21] things that uh if if it could have been
[1:12:24] caught early enough that would have even
[1:12:26] further deteriorated the quality of her
[1:12:29] life God wouldn't have wanted that for
[1:12:31] her when she was presented with the
[1:12:33] option of seeing the specialist and
[1:12:36] seeing what kind of treatment would be
[1:12:38] available she immediately knew that that
[1:12:41] was not what she wanted to do and she
[1:12:42] was of sound mind at that time and able
[1:12:45] to make that decision decision so I want
[1:12:48] us to pray with everything that we have
[1:12:51] that God's perfect will is done that
[1:12:54] there is no shaking in our faith that we
[1:12:57] will trust the Lord we will continue to
[1:13:00] believe in the Supernatural and uh I
[1:13:03] haven't changed my mind I know that
[1:13:06] she's got a new body one that will I
[1:13:08] just wish there was time
[1:13:10] I I shared reminders with my family her
[1:13:15] story the bits and pieces I shared with
[1:13:18] you Tuesday night she has been a walking
[1:13:20] miracle
[1:13:21] walking Miracle
[1:13:23] uh thought to be dead 40 something years
[1:13:27] ago at the scene of a horrendous
[1:13:30] accident that separated part of her
[1:13:33] brain tissue from her skull
[1:13:35] never expected to communicate or walk
[1:13:37] again and God gave her some beautiful
[1:13:41] years she saw her family flourishing
[1:13:44] around her she has uh Joseph and Rebecca
[1:13:50] and and Esther who have loved on her and
[1:13:54] have brought so many smiles to her face
[1:13:57] and her mother has been with her from
[1:14:00] the beginning of her life
[1:14:02] can you imagine only a very short time
[1:14:05] have they had to live apart sister Weems
[1:14:09] moved into the hospital and rearranged
[1:14:11] her life so many times even after Royale
[1:14:15] was married and we want to pray for
[1:14:17] special strength today for sister Weems
[1:14:20] and for the whole family
[1:14:22] uh as they came to get her
[1:14:25] on Friday afternoon uh you know you
[1:14:28] always stand back and let them do their
[1:14:31] thing and uh I just had a desire to get
[1:14:34] closer to her and have been had been
[1:14:37] with her for several hours but she was
[1:14:39] resting a good portion of that time
[1:14:42] thank God because when she wasn't
[1:14:44] resting she was very sick I stepped out
[1:14:47] on the porch in my sock feet when they
[1:14:49] when they uh had carried her out and
[1:14:52] then and then put her on the stretcher
[1:14:54] on the porch and the uh attendant said
[1:14:57] how about you sir would you come here
[1:15:00] and help me I I thought that was very
[1:15:02] strange all I did was Hold On To The
[1:15:04] Strokes to the to the stretcher so that
[1:15:07] it didn't roll away when they put her on
[1:15:09] it but I was so thankful I just wanted
[1:15:12] to be as close to her at that moment as
[1:15:15] I possibly could and we
[1:15:18] cried out to her you know as she was
[1:15:20] going we love you and we're praying for
[1:15:22] you uh I have a beautiful memory that
[1:15:25] I'm not going to let anything take from
[1:15:27] me I wrote it down
[1:15:29] so that if I live long enough to need to
[1:15:31] read it I will uh if it should Escape my
[1:15:34] mind and that is as they as they got her
[1:15:37] out there to put her in the ambulance
[1:15:39] and they had to clear the door so they
[1:15:42] had to swing swing around and Justice
[1:15:44] they were swinging the door she threw up
[1:15:46] her hand and waved at me
[1:15:48] and I appreciated that so much uh so
[1:15:52] thankful for her life and we'll be
[1:15:54] thrilled if Tuesday night uh she walks
[1:15:58] in here well and whole
[1:16:00] uh you know I I'm not prepared I don't
[1:16:03] think physically prepared for that kind
[1:16:05] of Revival yet
[1:16:07] can you imagine what that would do uh it
[1:16:11] would certainly draw some attention to
[1:16:13] the king that would be our desire but if
[1:16:16] God has another thought I promise you I
[1:16:19] woke up this morning my song this
[1:16:21] morning when I woke up was uh if I
[1:16:25] survey all the good things
[1:16:27] that come to me from above
[1:16:30] should I count
[1:16:33] all the blessings
[1:16:34] from his Storehouse of Love I'd simply
[1:16:38] ask for one favor
[1:16:40] of him Beyond mortal men
[1:16:43] I'm sure he would Grant it again and
[1:16:47] again the chorus I want to stroll over
[1:16:50] heaven
[1:16:54] with you some sweet day
[1:16:57] when all of our troubles

[1:20:48] Bible with you
[1:20:50] I want us to go to Hebrews chapter 9.
[1:20:53] where we were on Tuesday evening
[1:20:57] I want to apologize to several of you
[1:21:00] there were about five people
[1:21:03] who requested to see me one evening this
[1:21:05] past week
[1:21:07] I was unable to do that I want to
[1:21:09] apologize to you for that I wasn't able
[1:21:12] to make a a an evening to do that
[1:21:15] I'm going to go over to hospice this
[1:21:18] afternoon after lunch early evening the
[1:21:21] Lord willing and I will be back here to
[1:21:24] the campground at some point so some of
[1:21:26] you younger ones that were on the list
[1:21:28] if you're here
[1:21:30] uh then I will I would be able to see
[1:21:32] you then I can't make any commitments
[1:21:35] unless it's an emergency for any night
[1:21:37] this coming week I don't know what the
[1:21:39] week holds just like your week I don't
[1:21:42] want to schedule something and not be
[1:21:43] able to uh to to take care of it and I
[1:21:47] want to tell you that other than the
[1:21:49] duties that I will have to uh perform
[1:21:51] I'm going to rest as much as I possibly
[1:21:53] can physically this week because next
[1:21:57] week
[1:21:58] well there's no rest then amen
[1:22:01] so if if you have an emergency we will

[1:22:12] and you would might would be here and if
[1:22:14] you're not you might want to plan to be

[1:22:23] certainly will uh and know that I'm
[1:22:25] praying there's power in prayer
[1:22:28] oh God answers prayer doesn't he all
[1:22:32] right Hebrews chapter 9 I had so much
[1:22:35] fun Tuesday night with you all
[1:22:38] and and doing a little bit of expository
[1:22:41] preaching I don't get to do that too
[1:22:43] often anymore just going through uh
[1:22:46] verse by verse it's my favorite way to
[1:22:49] preach but it's just not really what a
[1:22:51] pastor does most of the time I like
[1:22:54] taking it verse by verse the problem
[1:22:57] with that is you get so many trails
[1:22:59] going at one time you never do get back
[1:23:01] to all of them but let's go there this
[1:23:04] morning for just a moment Hebrews
[1:23:05] chapter 9 I'm going to read a few verses
[1:23:07] and then I'll let you have your seat
[1:23:09] then verily the first Covenant had also
[1:23:13] ordinances of divine service and a
[1:23:16] worldly Sanctuary which means of the
[1:23:19] Earth
[1:23:20] for there was a tabernacle made for
[1:23:23] those of you who enjoy knowing the
[1:23:26] Hebrew word for things the the
[1:23:28] Tabernacle is the Hamish Khan mishkan in
[1:23:32] Hebrew is Tabernacle ha when you put the
[1:23:35] word letters H A in front of it it means
[1:23:39] thee so if you say Hamish Khan you mean
[1:23:43] the Tabernacle uh when that Tabernacle
[1:23:47] was made the first wherein was the
[1:23:49] Candlestick and the table and the shoe
[1:23:53] bread which is presence bread which is
[1:23:56] called the sanctuary and after the
[1:23:59] second Veil The Tabernacle which is
[1:24:03] called the holiest of all we sometimes
[1:24:06] refer to it as the holy of holies which
[1:24:09] have the golden sensor and the Ark of
[1:24:12] the Covenant overlaid roundabout with
[1:24:15] gold wherein was the golden pot that had
[1:24:18] Manna Aaron's Rod that flooded and the
[1:24:21] tables of the Covenant you remember
[1:24:23] that's the stone tablets that the
[1:24:26] Commandments were written on and over it
[1:24:30] it the cherubims of Glory
[1:24:33] shadowing The Mercy Seat now remember
[1:24:36] these cherubims are Heavenly Creatures
[1:24:38] we refer to them sometimes as Angels
[1:24:42] they were created as Guardians of the
[1:24:45] glory oh my can you imagine that
[1:24:48] responsibility to be Guardians of the
[1:24:51] glory you and I are very similar to the
[1:24:54] cherubims in our broad Ministry did you
[1:24:57] understand that because we are also
[1:25:00] Guardians of the glory to call the
[1:25:04] precious things of God precious the holy
[1:25:06] things holy and those things which are
[1:25:09] profane we have to call them profane
[1:25:12] if we're going to guard the glory we
[1:25:15] have to say what God says we have to
[1:25:17] love what he loves and we have to hate
[1:25:20] what he hates that's not always easy but
[1:25:23] it's a responsibility of those who are
[1:25:26] called to guard the glory the heaviness
[1:25:29] of his presence all right uh shadowing
[1:25:32] The Mercy Seat remember they sat on top
[1:25:35] of The Mercy Seat their wings touching
[1:25:38] and the promise of the Lord was I will
[1:25:41] meet you there between the wings of the
[1:25:44] cherubims of which we cannot now speak
[1:25:48] particularly now when these things were
[1:25:51] thus ordained the priests went also into
[1:25:55] the first Tabernacle accomplishing the
[1:25:58] service of God that is the daily order
[1:26:00] of of the work and Ministry of the
[1:26:04] sanctuary but into the second the holy
[1:26:07] of holies went the high priest alone
[1:26:10] once every year so this evening at
[1:26:14] sundown we commemorate as do Jews around
[1:26:18] the world we commemorate that one day of
[1:26:22] the year that the high priest was
[1:26:25] allowed to come in behind the veil into
[1:26:28] the holy of holies he could not come
[1:26:31] without blood he had to come in with
[1:26:34] blood which he offered for himself and
[1:26:37] for the errors of the people
[1:26:41] all right let's go on just a moment the
[1:26:44] Holy Ghost this signifying that the way
[1:26:48] somebody say the way
[1:26:50] into the holiest of all was not yet made
[1:26:55] manifest while as the first Tabernacle
[1:27:00] was yet standing that is important to
[1:27:02] note as long as the Tabernacle was
[1:27:06] standing as long as the Earthly Temple
[1:27:09] was standing the Holy Ghost is teaching
[1:27:12] us that a way had not yet been made so
[1:27:16] that all men we should say all priests
[1:27:19] because how many of you know your
[1:27:21] ministry is one of Priestly order
[1:27:24] amen and not all priests could go in
[1:27:27] behind that Veil until the first
[1:27:31] Tabernacle was done away with and the
[1:27:34] Earthly Temple was done away with you
[1:27:37] become the Temple of the most high God
[1:27:39] that is not to say that the Jews will
[1:27:43] not do everything within their power to
[1:27:46] rebuild a third physical Temple we don't
[1:27:49] know how successful they will be but we
[1:27:51] know that according to the Book of
[1:27:53] Ezekiel there will be a restored temple
[1:27:57] in the new Earth
[1:27:58] we know that and the the not only do we
[1:28:02] know that but we know the dimensions of
[1:28:05] the millennial Temple and when we
[1:28:08] translate those Dimensions into Earthly
[1:28:12] measurements we find out that the
[1:28:15] present Temple Mount would not hold the
[1:28:18] temple that Ezekiel measured it would
[1:28:21] cover the entire city Old City and New
[1:28:25] City of Jerusalem can you imagine what a
[1:28:29] glorious place of worship is going to be
[1:28:33] built for us in the Millennium huge
[1:28:38] so much bigger than any Temple and that
[1:28:42] will only always remain a shadow
[1:28:45] it was always God's intention to dwell
[1:28:49] in men he wanted to live in men he
[1:28:54] wanted the Tabernacle in men are you
[1:28:57] still with me let's do just a few more
[1:28:59] verses and then you can sit down which
[1:29:02] was a figure a type a symbol for the
[1:29:07] time then present in which were offered
[1:29:09] both gifts and sacrifices that could not
[1:29:13] make him that did the service perfect as
[1:29:17] pertaining to the conscience
[1:29:21] which stood only in Meats and drinks and
[1:29:26] diverse Washings and carnal ordinances
[1:29:30] imposed on them until read that for me
[1:29:36] how many of you are glad for reformation
[1:29:39] two more verses and you can have your
[1:29:41] seat but Christ
[1:29:44] but Christ
[1:29:47] no matter what has been said but Christ
[1:29:50] no matter what has been done but
[1:29:53] mashiach the anointed one the Christ
[1:29:57] being come and high priest of good
[1:30:02] things to come
[1:30:06] even his coming was a prophecy that
[1:30:10] better things would follow by a greater
[1:30:14] and more perfect Tabernacle mishkan not
[1:30:19] made with hands that is to say not of
[1:30:24] this building neither by the blood of
[1:30:27] goats and calves but by his what
[1:30:32] on blood he entered in once
[1:30:39] into the holy place
[1:30:41] if as this day goes by you think at all
[1:30:45] about it being Yom Kippur this evening
[1:30:48] the day of atonement if at any time
[1:30:51] tomorrow it crosses your mind that Jews
[1:30:54] around the world are fasting for 25 or
[1:30:58] 26 hours they are fasting hoping that
[1:31:02] their works
[1:31:04] all right
[1:31:05] we'll inscribe their name
[1:31:08] one more year
[1:31:10] in The Book of Life
[1:31:12] if you think of that you better remember
[1:31:15] that once and for all
[1:31:18] Christ
[1:31:19] with blood entered in behind the veil
[1:31:23] not with blood of goats and calves but
[1:31:27] with his own blood he entered in once
[1:31:30] into the holy Place having obtained you
[1:31:33] read the rest
[1:31:37] eternal
[1:31:38] not temporal
[1:31:41] Eternal Redemption for us
[1:31:44] brother Greeley would you pray
[1:31:59] yes
[1:32:03] yes
[1:32:07] Hallelujah
[1:32:17] [Music]
[1:32:26] and the saint said
[1:32:28] you may be seated please keep your
[1:32:31] attention on the word
[1:32:33] now in in verse 10 if you will go back
[1:32:36] there
[1:32:37] it's talking about the ordinance of the
[1:32:41] law
[1:32:42] which stood only in meats and drinks and
[1:32:47] divers Washings and carnal ordinances
[1:32:53] imposed on them until the time of
[1:32:58] reformation
[1:32:59] that word Reformation in the Greek is
[1:33:04] diathosis and the word diarthosis means
[1:33:09] rectification it means something being
[1:33:13] totally set right or rectified it is a
[1:33:19] process leading to a new order I want
[1:33:23] somebody to say a new order
[1:33:28] to be realized when the scripture
[1:33:33] scriptures offerings and ordinances of
[1:33:36] Tabernacle worship and Temple worship
[1:33:39] were imposed on the believer until the
[1:33:42] time of reformation it could read just
[1:33:46] as easily until the time of the New
[1:33:49] Order I want you to remember that there
[1:33:52] is a new order in place
[1:33:55] it would not matter if the Jews were to
[1:33:59] be able to rebuild the Third Temple I
[1:34:02] personally believe they will it's my my
[1:34:04] thoughts that they will build something
[1:34:08] uh that can be used as a place of
[1:34:12] worship and there are those ministers
[1:34:15] who say if they do God would never allow
[1:34:19] them to offer animals again I can't say
[1:34:22] that I don't know what God will allow if
[1:34:25] his word doesn't tell us then we don't
[1:34:27] know there are indications that they
[1:34:30] might but I can tell you this it doesn't
[1:34:33] matter how many bulls they should offer
[1:34:35] or how many lambs they would offer the
[1:34:38] blood of the Bulls and the goats and the
[1:34:40] Lambs would never be able to do for
[1:34:43] anybody Jew or Gentile what the blood of
[1:34:46] Yeshua the crucified Lamb of God has
[1:34:50] accomplished it would just be a
[1:34:52] continuous over and over of the off
[1:34:55] offerings offered over and over
[1:34:58] sacrifices offered and ordinances kept
[1:35:01] but you and I who are a part of the one
[1:35:03] new man we recognize that God himself
[1:35:07] has established a Reformation a new
[1:35:11] order of worship it has been rectified
[1:35:16] that word rectified means to set right
[1:35:20] to correct to make it as right as
[1:35:24] possible and that is certainly what the
[1:35:26] blood has done it has not covered our
[1:35:28] sin because then if we get out from
[1:35:31] under the covering we're lost it has
[1:35:34] totally rectified our error it has set
[1:35:38] us free from our debt if you believe
[1:35:41] that you can say Amen
[1:35:44] all right now verse 11 but Christ being
[1:35:48] come and high priest of good things to
[1:35:51] come by a greater and more perfect
[1:35:53] Tabernacle not made this is such a
[1:35:57] blessing not made with hands that is to
[1:36:00] say not of this building neither by the
[1:36:03] blood of goats and calves but by his
[1:36:07] on blood he entered in to the holy Place
[1:36:11] having obtained once having obtained
[1:36:15] Eternal Redemption for us for if the
[1:36:18] blood of bulls and of goats and the
[1:36:22] ashes of an heifer sprinkling the
[1:36:25] unclean sanctify
[1:36:29] sanctifieth to the purifying of the
[1:36:32] flesh look at verse 14. how much more
[1:36:39] how much more shall the blood of Christ
[1:36:44] who through the eternal spirit father
[1:36:47] Abba Papa
[1:36:49] offered himself
[1:36:51] without
[1:36:53] spot without blemish without a dark hair
[1:36:59] no disqualifying feature whatsoever
[1:37:04] fulfilling every requirement offered
[1:37:07] himself without spot to God Purge your
[1:37:11] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[1:37:16] Living God now when we when we get in
[1:37:21] our mind that we do works we we go
[1:37:25] through uh disciplines or we carry out
[1:37:29] certain behaviors so that we can please
[1:37:32] God when we get caught up in that
[1:37:35] mindset it can it can make us feel okay
[1:37:39] it can make us feel temporarily
[1:37:42] Justified but at the end our conscience
[1:37:45] is there to get us
[1:37:48] and we can come under that that Holy
[1:37:52] strain of have I asked for forgiveness
[1:37:55] for everything is there something I
[1:37:58] missed is there some restitution that I
[1:38:01] failed to make when I came to the Lord
[1:38:04] that I need to get rid of and so God
[1:38:07] because he designed worship this way he
[1:38:11] designed the ordinances of the
[1:38:13] Tabernacle and the temple this way he
[1:38:16] wanted to offer something that would not
[1:38:18] only give you a temporary fulfillment or
[1:38:21] a temporary peace that made you feel
[1:38:24] like I am accepted but God wanted to
[1:38:27] give us something that would would
[1:38:29] cleanse and Purge our conscience that
[1:38:32] would cause us to never have to live in
[1:38:36] guilt or in condemnation again all we
[1:38:40] had to do was repent and we repent and
[1:38:43] we repent when we come to know that we
[1:38:46] have failed the Lord we repent when we
[1:38:49] come to know that we have failed the
[1:38:51] Lord we repent and we don't have to deal
[1:38:54] with the dirty conscience
[1:38:56] we don't have to deal with the
[1:38:58] condemning conscience we just keep
[1:39:00] pressing toward what God has called us
[1:39:04] to I'm calling your attention this way
[1:39:07] and uh he goes on here for just a moment
[1:39:12] how much more
[1:39:14] let's get it again how much more shall
[1:39:17] the blood of Christ
[1:39:19] who through the eternal spirit offered
[1:39:21] himself without spot to God Purge your
[1:39:25] conscience from dead Works to serve the
[1:39:28] Living God verse 15 and for this cause
[1:39:32] he Christ is the mediator
[1:39:36] of the New Testament praise God
[1:39:40] the newer Covenant that by means of
[1:39:43] death
[1:39:44] for the Redemption of the transgressions
[1:39:49] that were under the first testament they
[1:39:52] which are called Hallelujah
[1:39:55] are you the cult
[1:39:57] have you been called to serve the Lord
[1:39:59] that's one of the most valuable things
[1:40:01] that could happen to anybody they which
[1:40:03] are called might receive the promise of
[1:40:07] Eternal inheritance not just the promise
[1:40:10] but the Fulfillment of the promise that
[1:40:12] we might live with him in peace
[1:40:15] throughout all eternity verse 16 for
[1:40:18] where a testament is that's a covenant a
[1:40:22] contract there must also of necessity be
[1:40:25] the death of the testator you look at it
[1:40:28] like an Earthly will when someone leaves
[1:40:32] a will it's not really called just a
[1:40:34] will it's called the last Testament
[1:40:37] it's the will and the last Testament of
[1:40:41] someone and that Testament it may
[1:40:43] promise the world but you don't get the
[1:40:46] world until the testator dies how many
[1:40:49] of you are thankful that everything that
[1:40:52] he put in the will
[1:40:54] everything he wrote in the last
[1:40:57] Testament is ours
[1:40:59] Hallelujah and he got it for us
[1:41:02] he not only promised it to us but he got
[1:41:05] it for us because he went all the way to
[1:41:07] Calvary
[1:41:09] he paid the price
[1:41:12] with his own blood for a testament is a
[1:41:16] force after men are
[1:41:19] dead otherwise it is of no strength at
[1:41:22] all while the testator liveth let's let
[1:41:26] brother Branham say it
[1:41:28] let's look at the message the future
[1:41:30] home
[1:41:32] paragraph 145 wait on me
[1:41:39] cheaters here you know
[1:41:43] you become
[1:41:45] a new person say new person
[1:41:48] why
[1:41:50] because the high priest
[1:41:52] went in behind the veil
[1:41:55] he fulfilled the day of atonement
[1:41:57] requirement he fulfilled the requirement
[1:42:00] of Yom Kippur you become a new person
[1:42:03] amen not just an old one patched up are
[1:42:08] you here
[1:42:09] by joining church or trying to turn a
[1:42:13] new page but you are a you read it
[1:42:20] that's what Christ has done
[1:42:23] that's what Christ has done for us now
[1:42:27] so don't come around here trying to sing
[1:42:29] I'm a sinner saved by grace
[1:42:33] no no you're not that man anymore
[1:42:37] you're not the sinner
[1:42:39] you're the one who has been saved by
[1:42:41] grace you're not a patched up
[1:42:43] representation of who you were you're a
[1:42:46] completely brand new unit why the blood
[1:42:49] the blood the blood the blood the blood
[1:42:53] Hallelujah not the blood of the bull not
[1:42:56] the blood of the Lamb not the blood of
[1:42:58] the turtle dove but the blood of Jesus
[1:43:00] Christ
[1:43:01] Yeshua our Messiah
[1:43:04] not just a patched up one God takes the
[1:43:07] old man and burns him completely out
[1:43:12] with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:43:17] did you know the Holy Ghost is part of
[1:43:19] the Salvation plan
[1:43:20] you've got to have the spirit of God in
[1:43:23] you burning out the old
[1:43:25] burning out the dross and preparing the
[1:43:29] the Tabernacle preparing the temple
[1:43:32] preparing the body so that God himself
[1:43:36] comes to live inside of the believer
[1:43:40] so let's read it in context God takes
[1:43:43] the old man and burns him completely out
[1:43:45] with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:43:50] and comes himself
[1:43:53] sins down your representation
[1:43:58] that is the seed of God coming to life
[1:44:02] in the heart of the believer let's go on
[1:44:06] no man can come to me except my father
[1:44:09] has drawn him
[1:44:12] now I don't know about you but I've
[1:44:14] known people who put off coming to the
[1:44:16] Lord what kind of a business is that
[1:44:21] I've heard people say things like when
[1:44:23] I'm old and I can't enjoy sinning
[1:44:27] then I'm going to come to the Lord in my
[1:44:31] old age and I'm going to serve him and
[1:44:33] be a Christian then when I'm when I'm
[1:44:36] nearing the river you know craziness
[1:44:38] crazy talk that comes as a product of a
[1:44:42] church entity that has taught people you
[1:44:45] just come whenever you're ready
[1:44:47] whenever you're ready you can come and
[1:44:50] the Lord will be standing there without
[1:44:51] stressed arms you know that's not even
[1:44:53] what the Bible teaches us it's not even
[1:44:56] scriptural to believe that you get to
[1:44:58] choose the time of your new birth
[1:45:01] all right what makes us think that we
[1:45:05] can choose the day and hour of our new
[1:45:08] birth
[1:45:09] it's not our place it's his place so
[1:45:12] when he draws you
[1:45:15] you better come to him
[1:45:18] when God starts dealing with you about
[1:45:20] your Reckless life you better come to
[1:45:23] him now
[1:45:26] you know I know people that they want to
[1:45:28] come closer to the Lord when things are
[1:45:30] going bad in their life and then they're
[1:45:33] going with him a while until things
[1:45:35] straighten out in their life then they
[1:45:37] turn loose of the Lord and they go back
[1:45:38] into their way of living that they had
[1:45:40] before that's not a born-again
[1:45:42] experience you just got a little bit of
[1:45:44] religion on you you didn't have a new
[1:45:47] creature a new creation a new creature
[1:45:50] experience the Holy Ghost in fire didn't
[1:45:53] come and cleanse you so you turn around
[1:45:55] and go back to the weekend beggarly
[1:45:57] elements of addiction in this old life
[1:46:00] if you have been born again there is no
[1:46:03] going back
[1:46:08] we don't even fully believe in the
[1:46:10] concept of backsliding
[1:46:12] because we believe you may break your
[1:46:15] fellowship
[1:46:16] but your relationship Remains the Same
[1:46:19] you may have to work on fellowshipping
[1:46:22] with him again and communing with him
[1:46:24] again but because you you fall away or
[1:46:27] because you make some bad choices we
[1:46:29] don't believe that you're divorced
[1:46:31] because of that we don't believe that
[1:46:33] God loses you because of that we believe
[1:46:35] that he has paid the price once and for
[1:46:38] all he never has to die for us again
[1:46:42] come on this isn't joining the church
[1:46:46] this isn't joining some denomination or
[1:46:48] putting your name on a book or getting a
[1:46:51] letter transferred this is a spiritual
[1:46:54] experience where the old man dies at a
[1:46:58] representation of God replaces that old
[1:47:01] man are you following me no man can come
[1:47:04] to me except my father drawed him so my
[1:47:07] point is you here this morning and you
[1:47:10] streaming the service if if the Lord is
[1:47:12] dealing with you about your life come to
[1:47:15] him
[1:47:15] don't put it off
[1:47:18] come while you can he is not obligated
[1:47:21] to draw you again he will sometimes he
[1:47:25] has sometimes is there anybody here glad
[1:47:27] of that
[1:47:28] but he is not obligated to you better
[1:47:31] come when he draws you all the father
[1:47:34] hath given me will come to me you see it
[1:47:36] same plan same way
[1:47:41] paragraph 146 Satan will be taken from
[1:47:45] the earth just exactly like Satan was
[1:47:48] taken from you Satan cannot bother
[1:47:52] or he can tempt
[1:47:55] but he cannot get a born-again Christian
[1:47:59] praise God he tempts
[1:48:03] anybody testify
[1:48:05] he tempts but he cannot get a born-again
[1:48:09] again Christian for God from the
[1:48:11] foundation of the world foresaw him
[1:48:14] and sent Jesus to redeem him and I love
[1:48:19] this next sentence I'm going to let you
[1:48:21] read it and the
[1:48:27] that's what we sang here Tuesday night
[1:48:29] let the blood of Calvary speak for me
[1:48:32] let it write me down is righteous where
[1:48:35] no righteousness has been let the blood
[1:48:38] do the talking on my behalf because the
[1:48:41] blood is a perfect and complete
[1:48:44] restitution
[1:48:46] for sin
[1:48:48] hallelujah how can he sin when it can't
[1:48:51] be seen
[1:48:53] even by God
[1:48:55] he don't even the only thing he hears is
[1:48:58] your voice
[1:49:00] he sees your representation amen that is
[1:49:05] true see what is brother random telling
[1:49:07] us he's telling us God sees your lamb he
[1:49:11] sees your blood offering and it was not
[1:49:13] one you concocted on your own it's one
[1:49:16] that God transacted on your behalf he
[1:49:19] became the transaction
[1:49:22] in the first seal
[1:49:25] paragraph 80.
[1:49:30] every Born Again believer
[1:49:34] True Believer is perfectly
[1:49:37] absolutely sinless before God
[1:49:41] he is not trusting his works
[1:49:45] in the blood of Jesus that his
[1:49:49] confession has dropped into
[1:49:52] see you're not pleading your case based
[1:49:54] on your your week of uh uh of you know
[1:49:57] interactions
[1:49:59] you you may have made some bad messes
[1:50:02] this week I could ask for hands
[1:50:05] you you may have failed the Lord in some
[1:50:08] big ways
[1:50:09] this week you may have found yourself on
[1:50:12] a on a rabbit trail of thoughts that
[1:50:15] were leading you away from faith
[1:50:18] and if any of that is is right if I'm
[1:50:22] describing your weak you just repent you
[1:50:27] just come to the Lord and say Lord have
[1:50:30] mercy on me help me I Repent of of my
[1:50:35] shortcoming my failure and my unbelief
[1:50:39] that blood of Jesus has come and our
[1:50:42] confession has dropped out of our works
[1:50:46] and it has dropped into the blood that
[1:50:50] speaks on our behalf brother Branham
[1:50:53] goes on to say the Bible says so see he
[1:50:56] that is born of God
[1:50:58] does not commit sin for he cannot sin
[1:51:01] that's the scripture this is not some
[1:51:04] strange doctrine of William random
[1:51:07] this is what the scripture said
[1:51:09] how can you make a man a sinner
[1:51:12] when the bleach of the blood of Jesus
[1:51:16] Christ is between him and God now if you
[1:51:21] see any of this as a license to sin you
[1:51:27] have no revelation of the truth
[1:51:29] I don't even know what to say about you
[1:51:31] you don't understand what we're talking
[1:51:34] about there is no license to sin no true
[1:51:38] child of God says before they commit an
[1:51:42] attribute of sin no true child of God
[1:51:45] says well I know the blood will be
[1:51:46] speaking for me anyway so I'll go and do
[1:51:48] what I want to do and then no real child
[1:51:52] of God has that kind of a conversation
[1:51:55] in their head I'm being honest with you
[1:51:56] if you do something is missing
[1:51:59] something is missing but what we find
[1:52:03] out is if we realize that we have
[1:52:06] yielded our heart if we have yielded our
[1:52:09] thoughts if we have yielded our members
[1:52:11] to sin we recognize our condition we
[1:52:15] repent
[1:52:16] we call on the name of the Lord he
[1:52:19] covers us hallelujah once and for all
[1:52:23] he said can you make a uh how can you
[1:52:26] make a man a sinner when the bleach of
[1:52:28] the blood of Jesus Christ is between him
[1:52:30] and God he said that would scatter sin
[1:52:33] Till There be nothing left of it
[1:52:35] see how can that pure blood of Christ
[1:52:40] ever let a sin pass there
[1:52:44] what do you say
[1:52:45] he cannot
[1:52:47] one more paragraph 81 Jesus said be you
[1:52:51] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:52:54] Heaven is perfect and how could we even
[1:52:57] start the thought of being perfect
[1:53:00] we couldn't
[1:53:01] no
[1:53:03] surely you don't think your first
[1:53:05] thought about yourself is not that I'm
[1:53:07] perfect
[1:53:09] it'd be like the song you know I I
[1:53:14] uh I'll think of in a minute
[1:53:18] it's hard to be humble
[1:53:20] the old country song it's hard to be
[1:53:23] humble when you're perfect in every way
[1:53:27] can't wait to look in the mirror
[1:53:30] cause I get better looking each day
[1:53:34] to know me is to love me I must be a of
[1:53:37] a man
[1:53:40] it's hard to be humble when you're doing
[1:53:42] the best but I'm doing the best that I
[1:53:44] can
[1:53:45] now you know that's an old song
[1:53:47] that better not be your mantra for life
[1:53:50] I know some of you I can just hear you
[1:53:54] sing unto yourself in the mirror oh lord
[1:53:57] it's hard to be humble
[1:53:59] but no real child of God says I'm just
[1:54:03] perfect in every way
[1:54:04] I'm just so perfect my my if everybody
[1:54:07] could be like me you
[1:54:09] you should have heard the conversation
[1:54:11] in my office this morning about two pap
[1:54:14] paps
[1:54:16] you if you if you when was it was it one
[1:54:20] last Sunday was it last Sunday Sunday
[1:54:22] was a few weeks ago
[1:54:24] I had just been with with Zeke uh
[1:54:27] Ezekiel talking to him he'd been around
[1:54:30] me and in the process of of me getting
[1:54:34] my things I got my things I came out I
[1:54:37] got in the vehicle and I stopped my
[1:54:39] vehicle out on the volleyball court as
[1:54:41] Ezekiel is walking across there he now
[1:54:44] saw me where he left
[1:54:46] he now sees me where I am now and he
[1:54:49] didn't see me get there
[1:54:52] he said what two paps
[1:54:58] he's been recently asking his parents to
[1:55:01] see two pep peps again
[1:55:03] [Music]
[1:55:05] so we had quite a discussion in the in
[1:55:07] the office and I could get a whole lot
[1:55:09] done if there were two paps
[1:55:14] think about it one go one way and one go
[1:55:16] the other but David that only David
[1:55:20] so preciously graciously
[1:55:24] unnecessarily pointed out
[1:55:27] but he said I bet you'd have a hard time
[1:55:29] getting along with him
[1:55:36] [Music]
[1:55:38] that's his one joke wonder he's a real
[1:55:40] comedian now
[1:55:45] ain't it the truth
[1:55:48] we want everybody to be just like us
[1:55:53] this is kind of how we feel
[1:55:55] we're not saying it but it's kind of how
[1:55:57] we feel sometimes I want you to process
[1:55:59] life like I do
[1:56:01] and then if that were to happen we
[1:56:04] wouldn't be able to get along
[1:56:05] with that that one would we we're
[1:56:08] different we're fearfully wonderfully
[1:56:10] made
[1:56:11] nobody walks around thinking I'm perfect
[1:56:14] but the reality is we are made perfect
[1:56:17] not by our works not by a woman's long
[1:56:20] hair
[1:56:23] not by a man uh addressing a certain way
[1:56:26] or doing a certain thing or refraining
[1:56:28] from a certain thing it's by the blood
[1:56:30] of Jesus Christ we live the life we live
[1:56:33] not to buy our Salvation we live the
[1:56:36] life we live to testify of our Salvation
[1:56:38] amen sisters choose to dress different
[1:56:41] walk different live different not
[1:56:43] because they believe that that's what
[1:56:44] saves them
[1:56:45] they do that to testify to the world I'm
[1:56:48] different
[1:56:49] I've come through the blood of Jesus
[1:56:51] Christ
[1:56:52] it's it's what causes people to come and
[1:56:55] say where do you go to church
[1:56:59] do you ever think when you're out in the
[1:57:01] public you see a woman in a pair of
[1:57:02] short shorts
[1:57:03] a bleached out hair
[1:57:06] and a clown makeup on because that's
[1:57:09] what they do anymore
[1:57:12] it's it's it's if there ever was a time
[1:57:15] it was tasteful it's not tasteful now
[1:57:17] it's the most exaggerated thing
[1:57:21] a woman is not satisfied with her own
[1:57:23] eyelashes so she buys spiders to put on
[1:57:26] there
[1:57:28] you can spot it across the store
[1:57:31] see her desire is not to look natural
[1:57:35] if her desire was to look natural
[1:57:37] natural she might do something to try to
[1:57:39] thicken her own
[1:57:40] but because she'd rather look like some
[1:57:43] kind of freak of nature
[1:57:45] she goes out and gets something so that
[1:57:48] everyone who sees her can know she's
[1:57:49] glued them on
[1:57:52] nobody looks at her and think oh my does
[1:57:55] she ever have thick eyelashes they don't
[1:57:57] even think that
[1:57:59] they think wonder how much she paid for
[1:58:01] them
[1:58:02] they know they're not her so the world
[1:58:04] has gone so far insane if you were to
[1:58:07] see I'm not trying to be ugly I couldn't
[1:58:09] really get to the nitty-gritty now if I
[1:58:11] need to
[1:58:12] but if you saw a woman like that she's
[1:58:14] sucking on her last draw of a cigarette
[1:58:17] getting ready to put it out on the
[1:58:19] ground
[1:58:20] which is just sickening to me
[1:58:23] and uh I got tennis shoes sometime that
[1:58:26] they've got big cleats on them and
[1:58:28] they'll pick up one of them old things
[1:58:29] in a parking lot and walk around and it
[1:58:31] just makes me want to I tell you what it
[1:58:33] makes me want to do it makes me want to
[1:58:34] force somebody to eat them things that's
[1:58:36] what I'd like to do sometime that you
[1:58:38] throw them down for somebody else to
[1:58:39] step on now if you saw a woman like that
[1:58:42] who in this room would think to go over
[1:58:44] to her and say I really am looking for a
[1:58:46] church where do you go to church
[1:58:49] nobody's ever asked that woman where she
[1:58:52] has gone to church so that they could
[1:58:53] join her church even the old crazy world
[1:58:56] we live in
[1:58:59] if that woman
[1:59:01] as they are
[1:59:03] they look for somebody who looks like
[1:59:06] they're different than the rest
[1:59:09] it's not just in the clothes it's also
[1:59:12] in the countenance
[1:59:16] but I've never seen a woman like that
[1:59:17] with the Holy countenance
[1:59:21] so you're not going to be drawn to some
[1:59:23] somebody dressing like that or carrying
[1:59:25] on like that some man in a in a wife
[1:59:29] beater shirt on you know they call them
[1:59:32] you're going to go over and ask him his
[1:59:34] old hairy armpits uh hanging out of his
[1:59:37] tank top and old beer belly hanging over
[1:59:41] his short britches belly button shining
[1:59:44] out
[1:59:47] flip-flops on
[1:59:49] hello are you gonna go over there and
[1:59:52] ask that man where he goes to church so
[1:59:54] you can try out his church
[1:59:58] I know where his church is it's the
[2:00:00] first church of the living room
[2:00:04] sits in front of the idiot box
[2:00:07] day and night
[2:00:09] come on I don't want what he has
[2:00:13] I I want to find somebody that has
[2:00:16] gotten a hold of something that is not a
[2:00:18] keeping of a rule or a regulation but
[2:00:21] they have decided I mean they have
[2:00:23] decided I Surrender oh
[2:00:28] I don't have to be like the other fish
[2:00:32] I don't have to live like the other fish
[2:00:35] I choose to go the other way
[2:00:38] the way that says back to Calvary the
[2:00:42] way that says I am not my own I've been
[2:00:44] bought with a prize
[2:00:47] be therefore perfect even as your father
[2:00:50] in Heaven is perfect and how could we
[2:00:52] even start the thought of being perfect
[2:00:54] but Jesus required it I've told you so
[2:00:58] many times before that everything he
[2:01:01] requires he provides
[2:01:03] what a God
[2:01:05] won't you serve him
[2:01:08] what a God
[2:01:09] he's not asking you to do something more
[2:01:11] than than what you're able to do
[2:01:14] everything he requires he provides
[2:01:17] everything he asked of us he gives us
[2:01:20] Grace to be able to pay it back give it
[2:01:22] back
[2:01:23] brother Bantam said and if Jesus
[2:01:25] required it he has got to make a way for
[2:01:27] it
[2:01:28] and he has
[2:01:30] and he has
[2:01:33] his own blood if you believe that same
[2:01:39] man let's read on just a little bit
[2:01:41] Hebrews 9 18 now whereupon neither the
[2:01:46] first testament we're talking about the
[2:01:48] older Covenant we're talking about the
[2:01:50] law was dedicated without blood for when
[2:01:54] Moses had spoken every precept to all
[2:01:59] the people according to the law he took
[2:02:01] the blood of calves and of goats with
[2:02:04] water and Scarlet wool and hyssop and
[2:02:07] sprinkled both the book
[2:02:11] the record of the law
[2:02:13] and all the people
[2:02:16] this is describing the the uh red heifer
[2:02:21] the offering that was given
[2:02:24] uh I saw a great picture I wished I
[2:02:26] would have brought it uh a great picture
[2:02:28] of of the bridge that once connected the
[2:02:34] Mount of Olives
[2:02:36] with the Temple mount
[2:02:38] uh I wonder if I could just take just a
[2:02:42] moment we're just kind of a in in
[2:02:44] teaching mood
[2:02:50] oh my
[2:02:52] can I just share this with you Mary Beth
[2:02:55] just wrote and said I wanted to tell you
[2:02:57] that I had open wazee's iPad to put on
[2:03:00] worship music on Friday
[2:03:02] and she was writing a message on
[2:03:04] messenger and it said I want to praise
[2:03:07] the Lord that all is well she didn't get
[2:03:10] it posted but that was the confession
[2:03:12] that she was going to make on that
[2:03:13] service
[2:03:14] and in the midst of all she was going
[2:03:17] through on Friday she asked her family
[2:03:18] she said did you get to tell I think she
[2:03:21] asked Sister Williams did you get to
[2:03:22] tell brother Shelley how much I enjoyed
[2:03:24] that message
[2:03:25] did you get to tell him so that is so
[2:03:28] precious I'm glad I opened that up uh
[2:03:30] give me just a minute and let me send
[2:03:32] this that's not it
[2:03:34] thank you for helping me
[2:03:36] charity where do I send this to
[2:03:39] Hulk where do I send this to
[2:03:44] say who
[2:03:49] are we close enough yep there you are
[2:03:52] oh sorry that goes into text can
[2:03:54] somebody help me do that
[2:03:57] you got it can you but how are you going
[2:03:59] to get it up there
[2:04:01] come on
[2:04:10] praise God
[2:04:13] now that is a great picture
[2:04:18] it was there
[2:04:20] I've seen some of the ruins
[2:04:24] you see the temple over there
[2:04:27] at the end of the bridge
[2:04:29] see the fire coming up there out
[2:04:32] the this is an altar
[2:04:35] that was built on the Mount of Olives
[2:04:39] we're we're right about
[2:04:42] close to where the seven arches Hotel
[2:04:45] would be in modern day
[2:04:49] or maybe somewhere right about the uh
[2:04:52] Dominus flevitt or the Church of the
[2:04:54] Ascension
[2:04:57] and they built a bridge all the way
[2:04:59] across
[2:05:02] so that the red heifer could be see he's
[2:05:06] got the the hyssop in his hand the
[2:05:08] priest there on top of the altar do you
[2:05:10] see that and the and the Scarlet threads
[2:05:13] there hanging down from his hand and
[2:05:15] he's going to offer that and then the
[2:05:17] ashes will be walked across
[2:05:19] the bridge of that Valley there
[2:05:23] uh
[2:05:27] there's two valleys one is the valley of
[2:05:29] hinom and and the other one is what
[2:05:32] say it
[2:05:33] Kidron Valley yes this would be Kidron
[2:05:39] across that Valley there he walks in
[2:05:41] with the ashes of that red heifer so
[2:05:43] anyone who ever wondered exactly what
[2:05:46] that would look like now the bridge is
[2:05:48] gone the altar is gone and the temple is
[2:05:51] gone
[2:05:52] but once upon a time look I wonder how
[2:05:56] many years and how much effort it took
[2:05:58] that Valley is very very deep some of
[2:06:01] you have uh Hawken Chad and others have
[2:06:05] stood with me up on the Promenade
[2:06:06] looking down over on the old city you
[2:06:09] know how deep that thing is
[2:06:12] Sultan's pool down there on the other
[2:06:14] side and the uh tomb of Absalom down in
[2:06:18] the bottom of that Valley there and the
[2:06:20] Jewish Graves have been there for so
[2:06:22] many years the Tombstones are sliding
[2:06:24] off the mountain down into the valley
[2:06:27] I don't know how long it would have
[2:06:29] taken him to build such a bridge as that
[2:06:31] but I'm telling you it would have I
[2:06:33] don't know the dimensions but it would
[2:06:34] have been a real feat
[2:06:37] why would they go to such a trouble
[2:06:39] because it was the only way they knew
[2:06:44] to cry out to God for their life
[2:06:49] they were working their way to
[2:06:53] righteousness
[2:06:54] and God designed it that way
[2:06:58] but you know the next day some of these
[2:07:01] that worshiped today sang the Psalms
[2:07:04] sang praises to God watched with such
[2:07:08] holy reverence as the priest was walking
[2:07:10] those ashes of the red heifer back over
[2:07:13] to the temple to offer them there unto
[2:07:16] the Lord the next day their conscious
[2:07:18] was smiting them again
[2:07:22] once that day of atonement Yom Kippur
[2:07:25] was finished
[2:07:28] it would only be a matter of time that
[2:07:31] something would happen in somebody's
[2:07:33] life and their conscience would be
[2:07:35] smiting them again and they would be
[2:07:38] worrying again and they would be down
[2:07:41] buying a dove
[2:07:42] to take to the priest for a daily
[2:07:45] trespass offering we've got to make sure
[2:07:48] we keep God to peace you see some of the
[2:07:51] early Jews had this concept of God
[2:07:54] because of all the pagan gods that he
[2:07:56] was a bloodthirsty God
[2:07:59] and the only way to appease him was to
[2:08:01] keep offering him more blood and more
[2:08:03] blood and more blood and just like their
[2:08:05] Fanatics today there were always
[2:08:07] fanatics
[2:08:09] and these Fanatics would would try to do
[2:08:11] whatever some even stealing and cheating
[2:08:14] to get the money to buy a sacrifice so
[2:08:16] they could every day offer something and
[2:08:19] Jesus said this will never get people to
[2:08:21] God
[2:08:22] Jesus said this will never finish what
[2:08:25] we have started
[2:08:26] but he had a plan in his mind way before
[2:08:29] the first was established but the first
[2:08:32] was taken away to make room for the New
[2:08:34] Order the Tabernacle had to be brought
[2:08:37] down the temple had to be brought down
[2:08:38] so that a new order could be could be
[2:08:40] offered
[2:08:42] so in verse 19 it describes these
[2:08:44] different uh elements that were used
[2:08:47] verse 20 saying this is the blood of the
[2:08:51] testament which God hath enjoined unto
[2:08:54] you moreover he sprinkled with blood
[2:08:58] both the Tabernacle and all the vessels
[2:09:01] of the ministry
[2:09:09] now in verse 22
[2:09:12] and almost all things are by the law
[2:09:14] purged with blood and without shedding
[2:09:17] of blood it's no remission it was
[2:09:20] therefore necessary that the pattern of
[2:09:23] things in the heavens should be purified
[2:09:26] with these but the Heavenly things
[2:09:29] themselves with better sacrifices than
[2:09:33] these he's talking to us about the very
[2:09:36] idea for the Tabernacle was a vision of
[2:09:40] how things are in the heavenlies
[2:09:42] and it was by instruction that Moses and
[2:09:45] the Craftsmen that were chosen to help
[2:09:47] Moses they were able to duplicate the
[2:09:51] Heavenly Sanctuary on the earth to build
[2:09:54] things as much as they possibly could to
[2:09:58] look like what it was in heaven what a
[2:10:00] task
[2:10:01] and in doing so that which was placed on
[2:10:05] the earth it had to be perched and
[2:10:07] Sanctified with blood it was not holy in
[2:10:09] itself the things in heaven were holy of
[2:10:12] themselves the things that were
[2:10:14] duplicated in the earth were were not
[2:10:16] holy within themselves they had to be
[2:10:19] purified Sanctified set apart by the
[2:10:22] sprinkling of blood this is what Paul is
[2:10:25] telling us even the holy Ark even the
[2:10:27] holy Furniture had to be Sanctified and
[2:10:31] set apart by Blood God knew exactly what
[2:10:33] he was doing
[2:10:35] it was therefore necessary that the
[2:10:37] patterns of things in the heavens should
[2:10:40] be purified with these but the Heavenly
[2:10:43] things themselves with better sacrifices
[2:10:45] than these
[2:10:46] for Christ is not entered into the holy
[2:10:50] places
[2:10:51] made with hands which are the figures of
[2:10:55] the true but into heaven itself Paul
[2:10:59] wants you to know that Jesus didn't come
[2:11:01] and physically go through the temple
[2:11:04] and put his blood there he didn't have
[2:11:06] to do that that was just the Earthly
[2:11:08] Shadow he went into the heavenlies
[2:11:11] how many of you know he went into the
[2:11:13] head don't touch me
[2:11:16] I've not yet ascended to my father
[2:11:19] he had to go into the heavenlies and he
[2:11:22] offered his blood on the altars of
[2:11:24] Heaven
[2:11:25] he offered his blood in the Holy
[2:11:27] Sanctuary which was the Heavenly reality
[2:11:31] of what the Earth was only a type and a
[2:11:34] shadow and a model so I want you to know
[2:11:36] what a beautiful thing can you imagine
[2:11:37] how Heaven must have stood in awe
[2:11:41] as Messiah steps back in
[2:11:44] where was his Earthly body his Earthly
[2:11:46] body was laying in a grave
[2:11:48] he has now blessed be the name of the
[2:11:51] Lord he has not entered in with his
[2:11:53] Earthly body he's entered in with
[2:11:55] another kind of body altogether
[2:11:58] and these are the figures of the truth
[2:12:00] but into heaven itself now to appear in
[2:12:03] the presence of God don't miss those
[2:12:05] last two words
[2:12:08] for us
[2:12:10] look at thou knowest all things
[2:12:13] and we don't have to be here
[2:12:16] so late but I want to get a little more
[2:12:18] of this in
[2:12:20] now we know drinking and carrying on his
[2:12:22] sin
[2:12:24] do you know that
[2:12:26] do you understand that this kind of
[2:12:28] behavior is is wrong
[2:12:31] he said but the whole thing is because
[2:12:32] of unbelief
[2:12:35] it's not because of the drinking it's
[2:12:36] because of the unbelief
[2:12:38] you you need to understand that if you
[2:12:40] really believe that God had made a way
[2:12:42] for you to have a better life you'd step
[2:12:44] away from those things that give you a
[2:12:46] rotten life
[2:12:48] and you'd come to him to try to find the
[2:12:50] better life that's promised by the blood
[2:12:52] for we know drinking and carrying on his
[2:12:54] sin but the whole thing is because of
[2:12:56] unbelief because if you believe God in
[2:12:58] Jesus Christ to be a son you are
[2:13:00] absolutely not going to do those things
[2:13:03] so the fact that we continue to do those
[2:13:05] things testifies that we don't really
[2:13:08] believe in Jesus
[2:13:10] we don't really believe that his blood
[2:13:12] is enough to redeem us it's it's pretty
[2:13:15] serious transaction here
[2:13:16] you're absolutely not going to do those
[2:13:18] things you believe that he that's born
[2:13:21] of God does not commit sin see all right
[2:13:26] You Must Believe
[2:13:29] the whole thing Lays
[2:13:33] Jesus said he that heareth my words and
[2:13:35] believeth on him that sent me has
[2:13:39] shall not come into condemnation but
[2:13:43] already passed from death into life you
[2:13:48] believe that too he said you believe
[2:13:50] that's the truth there it lays there
[2:13:53] isn't any there there isn't nothing else
[2:13:55] that you can do only believe
[2:13:57] and if you believe then them little
[2:14:00] immoral things will just drop off like
[2:14:04] that
[2:14:06] if they linger
[2:14:08] the problem is is the belief it's the
[2:14:11] faith it's putting the faith in and how
[2:14:13] often do we have to put our faith in the
[2:14:15] word all the time somebody say every day
[2:14:18] all the time every time the devil talks
[2:14:21] and he talks pretty often doesn't he and
[2:14:23] you believe you become love
[2:14:26] as you believe you become love
[2:14:29] and love is God and you begin to wind
[2:14:32] yourself into Christ
[2:14:36] and these other things you you don't
[2:14:38] have to
[2:14:40] we're going on you don't have to quit
[2:14:42] doing them
[2:14:43] they just quit themselves brother random
[2:14:46] says they drop off and I truly believe
[2:14:48] that
[2:14:49] I do know that there are people who deal
[2:14:51] with lingering issues and need further
[2:14:54] Deliverance
[2:14:55] but I believe what the word said all
[2:14:57] things pass away
[2:14:59] he said there's just no desire to do it
[2:15:03] that's why the old-timers who really
[2:15:05] believed in a full Deliverance at
[2:15:07] Salvation that's why the old-timers
[2:15:09] would testify I drink all the alcohol I
[2:15:12] want to drink
[2:15:13] but when I got saved I didn't want to
[2:15:15] anymore the desire was gone I don't want
[2:15:18] that anymore I don't desire that anymore
[2:15:20] he said there's just no desire to do it
[2:15:22] the worshiper having purged has no more
[2:15:26] conscience of sin
[2:15:28] our desire of sin and he refers us back
[2:15:32] to Hebrews 9 right where we're reading
[2:15:34] see the worshiper wants purged now that
[2:15:37] actual phrase appears in Hebrews 10 the
[2:15:40] first three verses
[2:15:41] he said see what I mean when the
[2:15:43] worshiper is purged it's when he is born
[2:15:46] again when his old nature dies and a new
[2:15:49] nature sets in then he becomes a part of
[2:15:51] God a Son of God brother Vanna means in
[2:15:55] actuation in reality
[2:15:57] in that moment in reality he's now part
[2:16:00] of God you also know that you came here
[2:16:03] with the representation of God as a seed
[2:16:06] he said he gets a new life
[2:16:08] and the Greek word there is Zoe which
[2:16:12] means
[2:16:13] what's it mean
[2:16:15] and you become an offspring
[2:16:19] wow
[2:16:21] I am a child of God I am an offspring of
[2:16:25] God
[2:16:26] okay now I don't know if you can do it
[2:16:29] together but see if you can read the
[2:16:30] rest of that and God can't
[2:16:37] see what I mean
[2:16:42] God can't hurt you
[2:16:44] without hurting himself
[2:16:47] the church has caused us to believe that
[2:16:50] God is just waiting on you to make a
[2:16:52] mistake
[2:16:54] so he can smack you over the head
[2:16:57] that's not the god of the Bible
[2:16:59] he would go to any length he would go to
[2:17:02] any measure he would do anything in his
[2:17:05] power and he's all-powerful to keep you
[2:17:07] from going back into those things
[2:17:11] he would rather preserve you he would
[2:17:13] rather sanctify you and set you apart
[2:17:18] can't just hurt you beat you judge you
[2:17:22] smite you
[2:17:23] in order to do that he would be smiting
[2:17:25] himself
[2:17:27] it takes a revelation to be able to see
[2:17:29] something like this can we read a couple
[2:17:31] more verses 25 through 27.
[2:17:35] nor yet that he should offer him himself
[2:17:39] often
[2:17:40] as the high priest enter at the end of
[2:17:42] the Holy place every year with blood of
[2:17:44] others for then must he often have
[2:17:47] suffered since the foundation of the
[2:17:49] world but now once
[2:17:52] in the end of the world hath he appeared
[2:17:55] to put away sin by the
[2:18:00] and as it is appointed unto men wants to
[2:18:05] die but after this the Judgment so
[2:18:08] Christ once offered to Bear the sins of
[2:18:12] many and unto them that look for him
[2:18:14] shall he appear the second time without
[2:18:17] sin unto salvation so Christ was once
[2:18:22] offered to Bear the sins of many and
[2:18:24] unto them that look for him shall he
[2:18:26] appear the second time without sin unto
[2:18:29] salvation and that completes the the
[2:18:31] ninth chapter of the book of Hebrews
[2:18:34] now maybe Tuesday night the Lord willing
[2:18:37] we can do something with Hebrews chapter
[2:18:39] 10. uh I want to move into something
[2:18:42] else before we close
[2:18:46] I want to remind you
[2:18:48] of a few things concerning this day of
[2:18:52] atonement
[2:18:55] uh
[2:18:59] someone come and get a microphone
[2:19:01] uh Elias come and get that microphone
[2:19:04] right there if you will dear brother and
[2:19:07] and turn it on if you don't have and and
[2:19:09] I'm going to get you to read some verses
[2:19:10] for me there's a lot of reading here and
[2:19:12] I'm going to save myself
[2:19:14] uh in Luke in in Leviticus chapter 16.
[2:19:18] we still have a little time here it's 1
[2:19:20] 14 for every clock watcher
[2:19:23] I'm going to have
[2:19:26] Elias to read a few of these verses
[2:19:28] because if any of you are interested in
[2:19:30] the day of atonement
[2:19:33] [Music]
[2:19:38] beginning at sundown this evening I want
[2:19:40] you to understand a little bit here and
[2:19:42] I may stop you but I want you to
[2:19:44] understand a little bit of what the
[2:19:46] priest had to go through in making
[2:19:47] preparation for for this
[2:19:50] uh I mean once a year
[2:19:54] and they believe that the congregational
[2:19:57] sins the sins of the congregation as a
[2:19:59] whole were forgiven for one one year
[2:20:02] because of what the priest did on the
[2:20:05] day of atonement however because they
[2:20:07] still had a sin conscience
[2:20:09] because they still had this guilty
[2:20:11] conscience then they would still
[2:20:12] continue to offer all these other
[2:20:14] offerings going way overboard
[2:20:17] spending way too much money
[2:20:19] just to try to make their own selves
[2:20:21] feel good about their life
[2:20:24] Jesus had to come and he had to stop
[2:20:26] this cycle can you imagine
[2:20:30] he had to do it as horrible as the
[2:20:33] destruction of the temple is God himself
[2:20:36] stood back and allowed man to destroy
[2:20:38] the temple
[2:20:39] because they could not embrace the New
[2:20:41] Order
[2:20:42] he had to show them that I had to take
[2:20:45] away the old
[2:20:46] so that you would begin to even try to
[2:20:48] see the new isn't that just like us
[2:20:51] hello
[2:20:53] that's why we couldn't just come to this
[2:20:54] message and sit in our denominational
[2:20:56] Church
[2:20:58] God had to take us out of the old
[2:21:02] or we'd never be able to embrace the
[2:21:04] fullness of the new
[2:21:05] you'd get a mixed meal every time you
[2:21:07] come together
[2:21:09] you you don't want a mixed meal
[2:21:12] you want to know what you're eating
[2:21:13] don't you watch what you eat all right
[2:21:15] Elias beginning in verse 1 of Leviticus
[2:21:18] 16.
[2:21:21] and the Lord spake unto Moses after the
[2:21:24] death of the two sons of Aaron when they
[2:21:27] offered before the Lord and died
[2:21:29] remember that is those who offered
[2:21:32] Strange Fire on the altar of the Lord
[2:21:34] read on
[2:21:35] and the Lord said unto Moses speak unto
[2:21:38] Aaron thy brother that he come not at
[2:21:41] all times into the holy place within the
[2:21:44] veil before the mercy seat which is upon
[2:21:47] the ark
[2:21:48] that he died not for I will appear in
[2:21:51] the cloud upon the mercy seats all right
[2:21:53] remember Aaron as the first high priest
[2:21:55] read on
[2:21:57] thus shall Aaron come into the holy
[2:22:00] place with a young Bullock for a sin
[2:22:02] offering and a RAM for a burnt all right
[2:22:05] this is for getting ready for Yom Kippur
[2:22:07] for the day of atonement so Aaron is not
[2:22:10] to come in and out as the high priest at
[2:22:12] his will he can only come into the holy
[2:22:15] Place once a year and he comes in with
[2:22:20] the offering uh of a young Bullock and a
[2:22:24] ram a RAM for a burnt offering and a
[2:22:27] young bull a calf for a sin offering all
[2:22:30] right read on
[2:22:32] he shall he shall put on the holy linen
[2:22:36] coat
[2:22:37] and he shall have the linen breaches
[2:22:40] upon his flesh and shall be girded with
[2:22:43] a linen girdle and with the linen miter
[2:22:46] shell he be attired These Are Holy
[2:22:49] garments therefore shall he wash his
[2:22:53] flesh and water and so put them on all
[2:22:55] right and he shall
[2:22:58] and he shall take of the congregation of
[2:23:00] the children of Israel two kids of the
[2:23:03] goats for a sin offering and one RAM for
[2:23:06] a burnt offering now here is a
[2:23:08] continuation now after he has changed
[2:23:11] his clothes
[2:23:13] he has now put on the holy ifod
[2:23:17] the underneath it's the working garment
[2:23:20] it's not the Royal garment with the
[2:23:22] breastplate he's taken that off he now
[2:23:25] puts on the working garment and uh I I
[2:23:29] might just say here that uh
[2:23:33] uh he was given the requirement of
[2:23:36] wearing these linen breeches
[2:23:39] and they were to be underneath his robe
[2:23:43] because the the the the working Garment
[2:23:47] of the ephod did not come all the way
[2:23:48] down
[2:23:50] and the Bible said that he was to be
[2:23:52] careful when he went up on the altar
[2:23:55] that he did not expose the nakedness of
[2:23:58] his thigh
[2:24:00] now he was in a holy Place wasn't he
[2:24:03] so he had to be careful how he went in
[2:24:05] all right go on
[2:24:08] and Aaron shall offer his Bullock of the
[2:24:11] sin offering which is for himself and
[2:24:13] make an atonement for himself and for
[2:24:16] his house so this particular part of the
[2:24:19] offering the Bullock for the sin
[2:24:21] offering was to cover himself and his
[2:24:24] house
[2:24:26] okay go ahead
[2:24:28] and he shall take the two goats and
[2:24:30] present them before the Lord at the door
[2:24:32] of the Tabernacle of the congregation
[2:24:35] here are the two goats
[2:24:37] and Aaron shall cast lots upon the Two
[2:24:40] Goats one lot for the Lord and the other
[2:24:43] lots for the scapegoat
[2:24:46] and Aaron shall bring the goats upon
[2:24:48] which the Lord's lot fell and offer him
[2:24:52] for a sin offering now there was a
[2:24:55] golden vessel in this golden vessel were
[2:24:58] two lots
[2:24:59] two little tokens
[2:25:02] on one token it said for Adonai for the
[2:25:05] Lord on the other token it said
[2:25:10] and that was for the scapegoat one is
[2:25:14] for the Lord one is the scapegoat all
[2:25:17] right go ahead and read
[2:25:19] but the goats on which the lot fell to
[2:25:22] be the scapegoat shall be presented
[2:25:24] alive before the Lord he would take
[2:25:26] those lots one for the Lord one for the
[2:25:30] scapegoat
[2:25:31] shake them in the vessel reach in
[2:25:33] blindly and lay those tokens on the head
[2:25:36] of these two goats and in that moment
[2:25:40] the Lord was choosing not the high
[2:25:42] priest the Lord was directing the Lots
[2:25:45] this is what they believed I do too that
[2:25:49] the Lord was directing the lot and one
[2:25:52] of the Lots is held on one head one is
[2:25:54] held on the other one becomes the
[2:25:56] sacrifice and one becomes the scapegoat
[2:25:58] that is released into the Wilderness
[2:26:00] read on
[2:26:02] the make an atonements with him
[2:26:04] to let him go for a scapegoat Into the
[2:26:06] Wilderness so one dice
[2:26:09] of the people
[2:26:15] of the freedom of the people
[2:26:17] read on
[2:26:18] and Aaron shall bring the Bullock of the
[2:26:21] sin offering which is for himself and
[2:26:23] shall make an atonement for himself and
[2:26:25] for his house and shall kill the Bullock
[2:26:28] of the sin offering which is for himself
[2:26:31] read on and he shall take a sensor full
[2:26:35] of burning coals of fire from off the
[2:26:37] altar before the Lord so now he takes
[2:26:40] the sensor with
[2:26:42] a vessel that is shaped in such a way
[2:26:46] that it can hold hot coals and incense
[2:26:49] drop down on those hot coals with holes
[2:26:53] in this uh vessel so that the smoke and
[2:26:56] the fragrance could be released remember
[2:26:59] the high priest even though he had blood
[2:27:02] he could not go into the holy of holies
[2:27:05] unless he first filled that area with
[2:27:09] this fragrance of the Holy incense
[2:27:11] remember that Holy incense is
[2:27:13] representative of the prayers and the
[2:27:16] worship of the Saints so prayer had to
[2:27:20] proceed and worship had to precede the
[2:27:22] blood interesting isn't it that's why
[2:27:25] prayer and worship precedes the delivery
[2:27:28] of the word it creates when you say when
[2:27:31] you hear us say we're creating an
[2:27:33] atmosphere we're filling up the
[2:27:35] spiritual atmosphere with prayer and
[2:27:37] worship just like the holy incense and
[2:27:40] the and the smoke of the Holy incense
[2:27:43] before he would go in read on I know
[2:27:45] there's a lot of reading but I like it
[2:27:47] in his hands full of sweet incest beaten
[2:27:51] small and bring it within the veil
[2:27:53] alright go ahead and he shall put the
[2:27:56] incense upon the fire before the Lord
[2:27:58] that the cloud of the incense May cover
[2:28:01] the mercy seats that is upon the
[2:28:03] testimony that he died listen at what
[2:28:05] the penalty is if he doesn't create the
[2:28:08] right atmosphere before offering the
[2:28:10] blood
[2:28:12] he dies
[2:28:14] so I don't I don't think I I don't quite
[2:28:17] understand how we could come to a day in
[2:28:19] the message of the hour where we would
[2:28:21] minimalize the importance of praise and
[2:28:24] worship in preparing the atmosphere for
[2:28:26] the word to come forth it can't even be
[2:28:28] born in your heart in the wrong
[2:28:29] atmosphere did you know you hear the
[2:28:32] word it'll fall right off of you in the
[2:28:33] wrong atmosphere it only attaches itself
[2:28:36] in the right atmosphere and this is all
[2:28:38] shown to us in the example here of of
[2:28:41] the day of atonement read on uh Elias
[2:28:44] you're doing a great job
[2:28:46] and he shall take of the blood of the
[2:28:49] Bullock and sprinkle it with his finger
[2:28:51] upon The Mercy Seat Eastward and before
[2:28:54] the mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the
[2:28:56] blood with his fingers seven times he
[2:28:59] dips his finger into the blood he stands
[2:29:02] before the mercy seat which is the Ark
[2:29:05] of the Covenant the lid of the Ark of
[2:29:07] the Covenant and he sprinkles the blood
[2:29:10] with his fingers like strowing the blood
[2:29:12] with his finger seven times all of this
[2:29:16] the day of atonement go ahead
[2:29:20] then shall he kill the goats of the sin
[2:29:22] offering that is for the people and
[2:29:24] bring his blood within the veil he's
[2:29:26] moving in and out
[2:29:28] and do with that blood as he did with
[2:29:30] the blood of the Bullock and sprinkle it
[2:29:32] upon the mercy seats and before the
[2:29:34] mercy all right go ahead and he shall
[2:29:36] make an atonement that's the holy place
[2:29:38] that word atonement is Kapoor it is it
[2:29:41] means uh the atoning sacrifice and
[2:29:45] that's where we get the the name Yom
[2:29:48] Kippur or the day of atonement it's the
[2:29:50] same word for the holy Place read on
[2:29:52] because of the uncleanness of the
[2:29:54] children of Israel and because of their
[2:29:56] transgressions in all their sin and so
[2:29:59] shall he do for the Tabernacle of the
[2:30:01] congregation that remaineth among them
[2:30:04] in the midst of their uncleanness let's
[2:30:06] go come on
[2:30:07] and there shall be no man in the
[2:30:09] Tabernacle of the congregation when he
[2:30:12] goes into make an atonement in the Holy
[2:30:14] place
[2:30:15] until he come out and have made an
[2:30:18] atonement for himself and for his
[2:30:20] household and for all the congregation
[2:30:22] of Israel so even in the Holy place
[2:30:24] which is outside the most holy
[2:30:29] that outer Court
[2:30:31] are always sacrifices and offerings
[2:30:33] being offered the priests remember the
[2:30:36] the the uh altar that was in the temple
[2:30:40] was so large that men climbed up on it
[2:30:42] we just mentioned that there were ramps
[2:30:44] that led up onto the altar we're talking
[2:30:46] about a huge thing we're talking about
[2:30:47] something uh like a half of this this
[2:30:50] Sanctuary being the altar we're not
[2:30:52] talking about little altars like in the
[2:30:54] Tabernacle and so it's very interesting
[2:30:56] that that whole area where there's
[2:30:59] constant busyness
[2:31:01] remember there's a fire on the corner of
[2:31:03] that altar that God himself lit and it
[2:31:05] was up to the priest to make sure that
[2:31:07] it never went out all these other
[2:31:09] implements the labor and all the
[2:31:10] different things for washing there's
[2:31:12] always somebody moving in and out but
[2:31:14] not on the day of atonement the whole
[2:31:15] Outer court is cleared no one is there
[2:31:18] until Aaron goes in as the high priest
[2:31:20] and carries out the various ordinances
[2:31:23] offerings and sacrifices that are being
[2:31:25] mentioned here read on
[2:31:28] and there shall be no
[2:31:30] and he shall he didn't finish this but
[2:31:33] let him finish this one
[2:31:34] and there shall be no man in the
[2:31:36] Tabernacle of the congregation when he
[2:31:39] goes in to make an atonement in the Holy
[2:31:41] place until he come out and have made an
[2:31:43] atonement for himself and for his
[2:31:46] household and the congregation right
[2:31:48] Israel go ahead
[2:31:51] and he shall go out unto the altar that
[2:31:54] is before the Lord and make an atonement
[2:31:56] for it for it
[2:31:58] shall take of the blood of the Bullock
[2:32:00] and of the blood of the goats and put it
[2:32:03] upon the horns of the altar roundabout
[2:32:05] now he's already gone into the holy of
[2:32:08] holies he's already sprinkled the blood
[2:32:10] twice he's now coming out and look what
[2:32:12] he's doing he's sanctifying the altar
[2:32:15] he's taking the blood of the Bullock and
[2:32:17] the blood of the goat and putting it on
[2:32:20] the four horns the four corners of the
[2:32:23] offering excuse me of the altar round
[2:32:26] about all of this the day of atonement
[2:32:28] read on
[2:32:30] and he shall sprinkle of the blood upon
[2:32:33] it with his fingers seven times and
[2:32:35] cleanse it and hallowed before the
[2:32:38] uncleanness of the church and hallowed
[2:32:40] from the uncleanness of the children of
[2:32:43] Israel they're constantly coming in and
[2:32:45] out offering these offerings for sin and
[2:32:48] trespass and now on this day not only is
[2:32:52] the blood placed on the Ark of the
[2:32:53] Covenant but even the altar is
[2:32:55] re-sanctified and re-cleansed in the
[2:32:58] presence of God read on
[2:33:01] and when he hath made an end of
[2:33:04] reconciling the holy place and the
[2:33:06] Tabernacle of the congregation and the
[2:33:09] altar he shall bring the live goat the
[2:33:11] scapegoat the live goat
[2:33:13] and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon
[2:33:16] the head of the live goat and confess
[2:33:18] over him all the iniquities of the
[2:33:20] children of Israel and all their
[2:33:22] transgressions and all their sins
[2:33:24] putting them upon the head of the goats
[2:33:26] and shall send him away by The Land by
[2:33:29] the hand
[2:33:31] Into the Wilderness now this was like a
[2:33:34] ceremony taking place
[2:33:36] the priest crosses his hands lays them
[2:33:40] on the head of the scapegoat he begins
[2:33:43] to confess the sins of Israel in a
[2:33:45] corporate manner you don't think he
[2:33:48] stood there for days do you calling out
[2:33:50] every sin of every person he does it in
[2:33:52] a corporate Manner and this was a symbol
[2:33:55] of the transference
[2:33:58] of sin onto the offering
[2:34:01] the New Testament tells us that this is
[2:34:03] what happened to Christ he who knew no
[2:34:06] sin was made sin he became sin on our
[2:34:12] behalf all of the sins of the world were
[2:34:15] transferred unto Christ though he knew
[2:34:18] no sin and when he died on the cross he
[2:34:20] died there for the sins of the whole
[2:34:23] world yet he knew no sin of his own this
[2:34:26] is the it's the type
[2:34:28] this is the type of that this is where
[2:34:30] the whole concept comes from the sins
[2:34:33] are being transferred
[2:34:36] spiritually onto the head of the
[2:34:39] scapegoat and he shall be sent Away by
[2:34:43] the hand of a fit man Into the
[2:34:46] Wilderness all right read on
[2:34:49] and the Goat shall bear upon him all
[2:34:52] their iniquities unto a land not
[2:34:54] inhabited and he shall let go the goats
[2:34:57] in the wilderness
[2:34:58] and Aaron shall come into the Tabernacle
[2:35:01] of the congregation and shall put off
[2:35:03] the linen garments which he put on when
[2:35:06] he went into the holy place and shall
[2:35:08] leave them there he's changing clothes
[2:35:10] again all on the day of atonement
[2:35:13] the working robe of the priest the ifod
[2:35:16] of the priests for working is now taken
[2:35:18] off and he's about to change garments
[2:35:20] all over again read on
[2:35:23] and he shall wash his flesh with water
[2:35:25] in the Holy place and put on his
[2:35:28] garments and come forth and offer his
[2:35:30] burnt offering and the burnt offerings
[2:35:32] of the people and make an atonement for
[2:35:34] himself and for the people
[2:35:37] and the fat and the fats of the sin
[2:35:39] offering shall he burn upon the altar
[2:35:43] and he that Let Go the goats for the
[2:35:46] scapegoat shall wash his clothes and
[2:35:48] bathe his flesh and water and afterward
[2:35:50] come into the camp redone and the
[2:35:54] Bullock for the sin offering and the
[2:35:56] goats for the sin offering whose blood
[2:35:58] was brought in make atonements in the
[2:36:01] Holy Place shall one carry forth without
[2:36:03] the camp and they shall burn in the fire
[2:36:06] of their skins and their flesh and their
[2:36:08] dung okay do you remember that bridge
[2:36:10] the picture of the bridge now on the day
[2:36:13] of atonement the priest comes back
[2:36:16] across that bridge
[2:36:18] to to put these things out
[2:36:21] they cannot remain in the camp
[2:36:25] remember what Hebrews tells us that
[2:36:27] Jesus suffered where
[2:36:29] without the camp this is the type of bat
[2:36:32] they had to take all that out and put it
[2:36:34] on the other side can you can you go
[2:36:36] back and let me see that
[2:36:41] uh I needed the verse I'm sorry but but
[2:36:43] but you see the bridge
[2:36:45] uh there it is shall one carry forth and
[2:36:48] the bullet for the sin offering the goal
[2:36:50] for the sin offering whose blood was
[2:36:51] brought in to make atonement in the Holy
[2:36:53] Place shall one carry forth without the
[2:36:56] camp and they shall burn in the fire
[2:36:58] their skins their flesh and their dung
[2:37:01] now the priest goes back across that
[2:37:03] bridge
[2:37:05] steps down off of that Altar and that is
[2:37:08] where these things were were placed
[2:37:12] and he it could not remain in in that
[2:37:15] Sanctified area
[2:37:17] and this is so beautiful because it
[2:37:19] talks about Christ who suffered without
[2:37:23] the camp now I might tell you that there
[2:37:27] are many archaeologists
[2:37:29] quite a few who believe that there is a
[2:37:33] great possibility that instead of the
[2:37:37] Golgotha that we know today where what
[2:37:39] we know is Gordon's Calvary today there
[2:37:41] are many who study many archaeologists
[2:37:44] who believe that in order for the death
[2:37:46] of Christ to fulfill all of these things
[2:37:49] that the cross actually had to appear on
[2:37:52] the Mount of Olives he had to suffer
[2:37:54] without the camp and that would have
[2:37:57] required him to be outside the walls of
[2:37:59] the old city and we know that there was
[2:38:01] a time that calvary or Golgotha today
[2:38:04] was actually inside the walls of the old
[2:38:07] city and so there are many people who
[2:38:09] believe that the cross itself
[2:38:11] was erected in the very area where the
[2:38:16] red heifer ashes were placed and the
[2:38:19] offering of the red heifer took place
[2:38:20] every year I don't know what to say
[2:38:23] about that except that God is a
[2:38:25] meticulous God nothing surprises me when
[2:38:29] it fulfilled every little detail coming
[2:38:31] together and fulfilling so that all can
[2:38:34] be taken away and the new to come forth
[2:38:36] read on just a few more minutes
[2:38:39] it's 1 30. and he that burneth them
[2:38:41] shall wash his clothes and bathe his
[2:38:44] flesh and water and afterward he shall
[2:38:46] come into the camp
[2:38:48] and this shall be a statute forever unto
[2:38:51] you that in the seventh month on the
[2:38:54] tenth day of the month you shall afflict
[2:38:56] your souls and do no work at all whether
[2:39:00] it be one of your own country or a
[2:39:03] stranger that sojourneth among you all
[2:39:05] right for on that day shall the priest
[2:39:08] make an atonement for you to cleanse you
[2:39:11] that you meet that ye may be clean from
[2:39:14] all your sins before the Lord
[2:39:16] read on it shall be a Sabbath of rest
[2:39:20] unto you and ye shall afflict your souls
[2:39:22] by a statute forever
[2:39:27] and the priest whom he shall anoint and
[2:39:30] whom he shall consecrates to minister in
[2:39:33] the priest's office in his father's
[2:39:35] stead this is the replacing of the high
[2:39:37] priest
[2:39:38] shall make the atonements and shall put
[2:39:40] on the linen clothes even the holy
[2:39:43] garments
[2:39:44] and he shall make an atonement for the
[2:39:47] holy sanctuary and he shall make an
[2:39:49] atonement for the Tabernacle of the
[2:39:51] congregation and for the altar he shall
[2:39:53] make an atonement for the priests and
[2:39:55] for all the people of the congregation
[2:39:57] amen read on
[2:39:59] and this shall be an everlasting statute
[2:40:01] unto you to make an atonement for the
[2:40:04] children of Israel for all their sins
[2:40:06] once a year and he did as the Lord
[2:40:09] commanded Moses now when you when you
[2:40:12] read this and you hear it talking about
[2:40:14] an Everlasting Covenant and a statue
[2:40:17] that is Everlasting
[2:40:19] does that say to you that it should
[2:40:21] never be mentioned in the new in the New
[2:40:23] Order or the New Covenant or does it say
[2:40:25] to you that even though we know there
[2:40:27] has been a fulfillment of these things
[2:40:29] because we have an Everlasting Covenant
[2:40:31] we should remember these things we
[2:40:33] should rehearse these things we should
[2:40:35] understand these things so I want you to
[2:40:37] know that's why we're talking about
[2:40:39] that's why we mark it on the calendar
[2:40:40] we're doing it because God made it an
[2:40:42] Everlasting Covenant and we believe
[2:40:44] according to to the prophet Ezekiel and
[2:40:47] to others Zechariah we believe that some
[2:40:50] form of these elements will be
[2:40:53] celebrated in the millennium
[2:40:57] something will take place to commemorate
[2:40:59] in fact there's indication that the
[2:41:02] Nations will will come up to Jerusalem
[2:41:05] to bring their offerings unto the to the
[2:41:08] Lord who sits in the Holy Temple
[2:41:09] remember
[2:41:10] and we don't know exactly what this will
[2:41:13] look like but if the church totally
[2:41:15] ignores the type and the shadow how can
[2:41:17] they fully understand the reality and
[2:41:19] the Fulfillment and how can we be
[2:41:21] faithful to the word if we don't even
[2:41:24] mention those things no wonder brother
[2:41:27] banham tells us that we watch Israel and
[2:41:30] we watch Jerusalem and we understand
[2:41:32] that they are God's timepiece it helps
[2:41:35] us to remember where we are now just a
[2:41:38] few more minutes
[2:41:40] I want to read you something
[2:41:43] that that is just pretty incredible
[2:41:49] are you listening
[2:41:51] inherits Temple
[2:41:53] early at dawn
[2:41:55] the priest escorted the hot the priests
[2:42:00] escorted the high priest to the bath
[2:42:02] house
[2:42:03] where he washed his hands and feet ten
[2:42:06] times
[2:42:08] dressed in his golden robe of Exodus 28
[2:42:11] that is the the Royal robe of the priest
[2:42:14] it has it has the ephod it has the
[2:42:16] shoulder pieces it has the breastplate I
[2:42:19] mean it is a it is a uh I wonder if you
[2:42:22] could find some some example that you
[2:42:26] could just show us to remind us I might
[2:42:28] can send you one
[2:42:30] it would take me a minute to do so
[2:42:36] we're not going to ask you to
[2:42:42] to fast
[2:42:45] for 25 hours
[2:42:48] but what we are going to ask you to do
[2:42:50] is
[2:42:52] be patient this morning while we
[2:42:54] remember these things
[2:42:59] let me see I've got several here
[2:43:04] I'm going to send this one to you
[2:43:06] charity the same way because my airdrop
[2:43:08] didn't seem to be picking up from there
[2:43:11] this may not be the best one but it's
[2:43:13] one you can look at
[2:43:16] Hallelujah
[2:43:25] did it come through
[2:43:27] okay that's all I know you're working on
[2:43:29] it that's fine just want to make sure
[2:43:31] you got it from me
[2:43:40] this gives you a little bit of an idea
[2:43:46] this shows the turban and the crown the
[2:43:49] Onyx stones that are on the shoulder
[2:43:52] pieces the the linen tunic underneath
[2:43:56] all right there we go
[2:43:57] I want you to look at this fellow
[2:44:02] you see the the shoulder see the chains
[2:44:05] that come down from the black onyx on
[2:44:08] his shoulder pads uh pieces it comes
[2:44:11] down there
[2:44:12] there's a blue robe that goes over the
[2:44:14] top of the linen tunic then then
[2:44:17] connected to the shoulder pieces are the
[2:44:20] uh is the breastplate where the where
[2:44:24] the urum and the thamim are the urim and
[2:44:27] thumim are two meme
[2:44:30] and the 12 Stones are on the outside
[2:44:33] behind that little behind that little
[2:44:35] pocket is where the urim and the thumim
[2:44:37] went behind those stones there's a
[2:44:39] little pocket coming down there that you
[2:44:41] could see that was inside then the 12
[2:44:43] Stones are there the blue robe showing
[2:44:46] us down on the bottoms of the blue robe
[2:44:49] there golden bells and pomegranates
[2:44:51] underneath he has linen pants
[2:44:54] so that he is covered all the way down
[2:44:57] and this is just a close-up of the crown
[2:45:00] that goes on top of the and what did it
[2:45:03] say on the crown
[2:45:04] remember
[2:45:05] holy unto the Lord
[2:45:08] so this gives you a little bit of an
[2:45:09] idea what he looked like just leave that
[2:45:11] up if you want to and let me finish
[2:45:12] reading
[2:45:14] he's washed his hands and feet ten times
[2:45:16] dressed in his golden robes he offered
[2:45:19] the morning sacrifice with his miter
[2:45:22] which is the is the tune the top of the
[2:45:25] the white part that you see behind the
[2:45:27] crown with this miter and Golden Crown
[2:45:30] and on his head that was inscribed
[2:45:33] Holiness under the Lord stones on his
[2:45:35] breast and golden Bells hanging from the
[2:45:38] rich purple robe back to the bath house
[2:45:41] he goes where he washed and dressed in
[2:45:44] spotless white linen he then approached
[2:45:48] the young bull placed his hands on its
[2:45:51] head and said I beseech the Lord I have
[2:45:55] sinned I and my household have
[2:45:57] transgressed against thee then he moves
[2:46:01] to the Two Goats which were Tethered on
[2:46:03] the east side of the altar he reached
[2:46:06] into the urn and shuffled the two golden
[2:46:08] tablets to be drawn as lots to determine
[2:46:12] which goat was to be the sacrifice and
[2:46:15] which was to be the scapegoat
[2:46:23] sorry about that give me just a moment
[2:46:33] the people believed
[2:46:36] that it was a good sign
[2:46:42] if the tablet marked for the Lord
[2:46:48] was drawn out by the priest's right hand
[2:46:54] but from 80 30
[2:46:57] till the destruction of the temple in
[2:47:00] ad70
[2:47:02] and for those 40 years only
[2:47:07] this is recorded in the mishnah
[2:47:10] and in talmud
[2:47:13] for 40 years only the high priest
[2:47:17] when he reached in with his right hand
[2:47:19] instead of pulling out for the Lord
[2:47:21] which was to be a good sign he pulled
[2:47:25] out for Azazel the scapegoat the priest
[2:47:30] would fall on their faces
[2:47:33] and pray for their Temple and their
[2:47:36] people they knew that it was an omen
[2:47:39] what what the what we would call an omen
[2:47:42] you say well I don't believe in that
[2:47:44] well they knew that God deals by signs
[2:47:47] and wonders
[2:47:48] and for 40 years it was not for the Lord
[2:47:51] in the right hand it was for the
[2:47:53] scapegoat the tablets were then placed
[2:47:56] on the heads of the goats sealing their
[2:47:58] Fates
[2:47:59] the Hebrew word for scapegoat is Azazel
[2:48:03] as a sale was seen as a type of Satan
[2:48:08] the sins of the people and thus the
[2:48:12] punishment of the people were laid upon
[2:48:14] Azazel the scapegoat he would bear the
[2:48:18] sins of the people and the punishment of
[2:48:20] the people would be upon him as Azale
[2:48:23] being sent in the wilderness is
[2:48:25] understood to be a picture of a final
[2:48:27] judgment and the Enemy being Cast Away
[2:48:30] forever
[2:48:31] as the sacrificial goat was led away the
[2:48:34] high priest would tie this is important
[2:48:36] to hear
[2:48:37] as the sacrificial goat was led away the
[2:48:40] high priest would tie a red sash
[2:48:43] on the horns of the scapegoat he could
[2:48:46] not be driven away until after the blood
[2:48:49] was shed the priests then returned to
[2:48:53] the bull prayed over him again killed
[2:48:56] the animal the blood was caught in a
[2:48:58] basin by another priest while the high
[2:49:01] priest poured hands of incense into a
[2:49:03] gold in a golden ladle with the ladle in
[2:49:06] one hand he picked up the golden fire
[2:49:08] pan with hot coals and entered into the
[2:49:11] holy of holies
[2:49:13] he then placed the coals on the
[2:49:15] foundation stone and poured the incense
[2:49:18] over them
[2:49:19] the foundation stone was that that the
[2:49:22] Ark of the Covenant sat on
[2:49:24] as the holy of holies filled with smoke
[2:49:27] he stepped out prayed again and took the
[2:49:30] Basin of blood from the priest that had
[2:49:32] been stirring it the entire time
[2:49:34] why
[2:49:36] to keep it from coagulation
[2:49:39] and again he entered into the holy of
[2:49:41] holies this time to sprinkle the blood
[2:49:44] on the altar how many times
[2:49:46] seven times he then stepped out again
[2:49:49] killed the sacrificial goat collected
[2:49:52] the blood entered into the holy of
[2:49:54] holies for a third and final time
[2:49:57] now if the mishna is right
[2:50:00] there were many years that this was done
[2:50:02] in the temple supernaturally
[2:50:05] there was no witness
[2:50:07] and there remember there was someone who
[2:50:09] had been standing there stirring that
[2:50:11] blood there was no witness that ever saw
[2:50:13] them going under the veil for many years
[2:50:16] it was believed that God somehow
[2:50:19] supernaturally took the high priest
[2:50:22] behind the veil and brought him out to
[2:50:24] continue on his work do you struggle to
[2:50:25] believe something like that
[2:50:27] I don't
[2:50:29] not in the least
[2:50:35] afterward
[2:50:37] a special handle
[2:50:39] took the Crimson sash from the
[2:50:42] scapegoat's horns
[2:50:44] excuse me a special Handler
[2:50:47] took the Crimson sash from the
[2:50:49] scapegoats horns tore it into
[2:50:52] and tied half of it back on the horns of
[2:50:56] the scapegoat
[2:50:57] does anybody remember where the other
[2:50:59] part went
[2:51:01] as the people chanted hurry up and go
[2:51:03] hurry up and go hurry up and go
[2:51:07] the
[2:51:08] condemned animal was led through a gate
[2:51:11] of the Temple
[2:51:13] and escorted
[2:51:15] with his Handler by different
[2:51:17] individuals in a relay do you understand
[2:51:20] a Handler would send the gold escorting
[2:51:23] the next person who would take it and
[2:51:25] escort him to the next Handler
[2:51:28] when they reached the appointed place
[2:51:30] which was a cliff
[2:51:32] about 10 miles outside the city
[2:51:35] the goat Handler
[2:51:37] would drive the goat off the cliff and
[2:51:40] into the Ravine below
[2:51:42] the runners would then run back quickly
[2:51:45] to the temple to bring the news later
[2:51:48] the bodies of the gold and the bull
[2:51:51] are burned and we talked about that the
[2:51:53] priests would have to go back over a
[2:51:54] cross
[2:51:56] now here is something interesting
[2:51:58] recorded in the mishnah
[2:52:00] according to the mission of the other
[2:52:02] portion of the sash was attached to the
[2:52:05] door of the temple so the red sash torn
[2:52:08] into it had previously been tied to the
[2:52:11] goat's horns torn into half of that sash
[2:52:15] now tied back on the goat's horns half
[2:52:17] of it tied to the doorway of the Temple
[2:52:21] had to happen before the goat was driven
[2:52:23] into the Wilderness the sash
[2:52:26] is noted to have eventually turned from
[2:52:29] red to White
[2:52:31] signalized signaling that the goat
[2:52:34] driven into the Wilderness had met its
[2:52:37] end
[2:52:38] and that God had accepted the sin
[2:52:41] offering of the people and their sins
[2:52:44] were therefore forgiven that'd be a
[2:52:47] pretty powerful sign to watch
[2:52:50] the the red sash to turn white again
[2:52:53] the mishnah says that for 40 years
[2:52:58] before the destruction of the Temple
[2:53:02] the sash stopped turning white
[2:53:07] can you imagine the grief
[2:53:09] that the Jewish people experienced when
[2:53:12] they realized that the goat had not died
[2:53:16] and had not been accepted as a perfect
[2:53:20] offering for the people
[2:53:21] 40 years
[2:53:24] before the destruction of the Temple
[2:53:27] when you start looking at that you would
[2:53:30] understand that's exactly the time that
[2:53:31] Jesus had died on Calvary
[2:53:34] it the minute that his blood was
[2:53:38] accepted of the father
[2:53:40] God said I'm going to show you I'm no
[2:53:42] longer accepting the blood of a
[2:53:44] scapegoat
[2:53:45] in that kind of interesting to note now
[2:53:48] I want to give you one last thing in
[2:53:50] closing I
[2:53:52] still uh we have the time we're making
[2:53:54] the time we're taking the time
[2:53:57] I want to show you something that
[2:53:58] brother Branham said
[2:54:00] can you find the quote there I think it
[2:54:03] was probably the only I've got my pages
[2:54:06] here so mixed up now
[2:54:09] it was toward the end of my notes
[2:54:13] yes
[2:54:14] now remember I told you that the Jewish
[2:54:17] people believe
[2:54:19] that the goat that was the scapegoat is
[2:54:22] also a type of of Satan the enemy
[2:54:24] because he was put into a place of of
[2:54:27] death or punishment
[2:54:30] this is something brother Branham says
[2:54:31] interesting about Christ and I love this
[2:54:34] because a spiritual eye can see Christ
[2:54:37] everywhere in the Bible
[2:54:39] this is what I found he was both
[2:54:42] I know you have that Brethren here
[2:54:45] believes that the devil was the
[2:54:47] scapegoat but no no no no no no
[2:54:52] what do you think he meant
[2:54:54] no
[2:54:55] Christ was
[2:54:59] he saw Christ in the one that gave his
[2:55:02] life
[2:55:03] and his blood was shed as an atonement
[2:55:06] for the people and brother Branham saw
[2:55:08] Christ in the one that was driven into
[2:55:10] the Wilderness he said both death and
[2:55:13] Resurrection you see he bore our sins
[2:55:16] away and then comes forth in the
[2:55:21] resurrection and so it was Christ being
[2:55:25] represented for the church musicians are
[2:55:29] coming
[2:55:30] took the church's place of sin
[2:55:34] and was cast into outer darkness in Hell
[2:55:37] remember he went down into the heart of
[2:55:41] the earth he went into hell and took the
[2:55:43] keys of death hell and the grave brother
[2:55:45] Branham sees that as he is going through
[2:55:48] hell to take those keys he sees that as
[2:55:51] a type of judgment on the body he said
[2:55:54] he took the church's place of sin cast
[2:55:56] into outer Darkness into hell and rose
[2:55:59] again the third day God raised him up
[2:56:04] what
[2:56:06] for our justification
[2:56:09] so here brother Branham was looking at
[2:56:12] the goat and the scapegoat it was of
[2:56:15] interest to him all of these things took
[2:56:18] place
[2:56:20] on the day of atonement now that was a
[2:56:23] busy busy few hours of time wasn't it I
[2:56:26] want you to play something Softly
[2:56:28] and I'm going to read one more thing to
[2:56:30] you
[2:56:32] Tuesday night will be too late
[2:56:36] it's already passed
[2:56:39] I want to read you an experience that
[2:56:41] the lord gave me
[2:56:42] in 2007.
[2:56:45] I've had several experiences with the
[2:56:48] Lord on the day of atonement
[2:56:52] I always take a few moments
[2:56:55] to see if he wants to meet with me on
[2:56:58] the day of atonement
[2:57:00] just prior to the day of atonement 2007.
[2:57:05] I think it was it was the evening that
[2:57:07] we
[2:57:08] we were going down to the beach
[2:57:11] for the day of atonement because Bob
[2:57:14] Jones
[2:57:16] had invited us to come and be with him
[2:57:19] on the day of atonement
[2:57:22] and Paul Keith Davis was hosting
[2:57:26] this Gathering where we spent
[2:57:28] the day of atonement in prayer all day
[2:57:31] long together
[2:57:33] I had gotten there that evening and gone
[2:57:35] out on the balcony when I had this
[2:57:37] experience so it was either the day
[2:57:39] before the day of atonement or two days
[2:57:41] before
[2:57:43] I saw myself
[2:57:46] as a high priest
[2:57:48] and never seen anything like this quite
[2:57:51] before I I was there but I was watching
[2:57:53] it
[2:57:54] I was being helped by other priests
[2:57:59] I experienced each detailed step as
[2:58:02] outlined in Leviticus 16. I washed in
[2:58:06] the labor I put on special garments the
[2:58:09] linen coat breeches Etc I Heard a Voice
[2:58:12] saying
[2:58:13] we must make preparation for coming
[2:58:18] into the holy
[2:58:20] I completely understood stand that Jesus
[2:58:23] Paid the price with his own blood and
[2:58:26] opened up the way for us to enter into
[2:58:27] the holy of holies however there is a
[2:58:31] Here and Now application and
[2:58:33] appropriation of what he did we must
[2:58:36] prepare I want you to hear this we must
[2:58:39] prepare for the greater glory
[2:58:43] I'm going to read it again I want your
[2:58:44] help
[2:58:45] we must prepare for the greater glory
[2:58:49] if Jesus has washed and Sanctified and
[2:58:52] set us apart where what is our
[2:58:55] responsibility there was grave danger in
[2:58:59] not making proper preparation before
[2:59:01] entering into the holy into the presence
[2:59:04] of the Shekinah Glory the penalty was
[2:59:07] death in this experience I clearly heard
[2:59:11] brother branham's voice loudly declaring
[2:59:15] what I had heard him say many times
[2:59:17] before fools will walk with hob-nailed
[2:59:22] boots Where Angels Fear to trod
[2:59:27] sometimes I feel concerned with the
[2:59:30] abundance of prophetic happenings being
[2:59:33] shared today in many circles the reason
[2:59:36] is the growing Trend to make what is
[2:59:39] Holy seem more common this has evolved
[2:59:42] from our desire to make the Supernatural
[2:59:45] and prophetic realm more accessible
[2:59:47] however in our impatience we have failed
[2:59:51] to discern between an experience
[2:59:53] initiated by the Lord in our spirit and
[2:59:57] one initiated by our imagination in the
[3:00:00] realm of our soul I don't think we
[3:00:03] realize just how dangerous our
[3:00:05] imagination can be throughout scripture
[3:00:08] the imagination is often referred to as
[3:00:10] something evil in man's heart it is also
[3:00:13] defined as a Graven image which is an
[3:00:15] idol in our desire to have Supernatural
[3:00:18] experiences are we choosing to
[3:00:21] circumvent God and what he has for us by
[3:00:24] creating things through vain imaginings
[3:00:27] and I go on I'm not going to read all of
[3:00:29] that to you
[3:00:31] I thought I I thought I had something
[3:00:33] else here that I wanted to get the
[3:00:35] message is this
[3:00:37] we must walk with Humble Hearts filled
[3:00:40] with deep gratitude and reverential fear
[3:00:43] as we approach the holy emptying
[3:00:47] ourselves of ourselves must be our
[3:00:51] sincere desire before we enter into
[3:00:54] those sacred and precious things which
[3:00:57] are behind the veil and we know that
[3:01:01] that's where we're invited to go do you
[3:01:03] believe that let's Stand Together
[3:01:08] I'm so thankful for the blood of Jesus
[3:01:12] I'm so thankful that I don't have to
[3:01:15] wait for the scapegoat to die
[3:01:18] to know that my sins are covered and
[3:01:22] that my offering has been accepted of
[3:01:24] the father I'm so thankful that we know
[3:01:28] today that once and for all the dead of
[3:01:31] sin is paid and we stand Justified
[3:01:35] before the Living God if you feel that
[3:01:39] way and you understand that why don't
[3:01:40] you raise your hands right now and thank
[3:01:43] him for the blood
[3:01:44] thank him for paying the prize thank him
[3:01:48] for the sacrifice that he has made on
[3:01:51] our behalf in times like this
[3:01:54] when we are reflecting on the
[3:01:56] requirement
[3:01:58] all the steps that were necessary to get
[3:02:01] through the offering how thankful we
[3:02:04] ought to be that Jesus Paid It All
[3:02:06] Hallelujah once and for all he paid it
[3:02:10] all In Christ Alone
[3:02:13] In Christ Alone somebody say that with
[3:02:16] Me In Christ Alone how we thank you Lord
[3:02:20] that in you alone
[3:02:23] is the forgiveness of sin
[3:02:25] and you alone is the sanctifying power
[3:02:28] of the blood released to Human
[3:02:31] released to mankind
[3:02:33] how we thank you for it how we thank you
[3:02:36] for it how we praise you this morning
[3:02:39] Blessed Be Your Name

[3:15:37] has set for so many years
[3:15:40] in her faithful desire to worship you in
[3:15:42] spirit and in truth
[3:15:44] and Lord I pray for her as she walks

[3:15:48] of her life
[3:15:50] I pray that your mercy your grace your
[3:15:53] strength will be upon her that you will
[3:15:55] supernaturally touch her body in such a
[3:15:58] way oh God that she has strength that is
[3:16:01] of the other world
[3:16:03] it's of the heavens
[3:16:05] we Minister our love to her today and
[3:16:07] most of all Lord if you will allow her
[3:16:10] to feel and to discern and to know your
[3:16:12] great love
[3:16:14] for her and her family
[3:16:17] she heard your voice many years ago and
[3:16:20] grabbed her children and ran
[3:16:23] because she believed Lord that you were
[3:16:25] speaking in a profound way and that you
[3:16:28] were doing something in Georgia
[3:16:31] she left everything behind to come and
[3:16:34] follow that word
[3:16:37] she has testified that she had never
[3:16:39] regretted that decision

[3:17:20] it's been holding on to you
[3:17:22] never wavering
[3:17:27] [Music]
[3:17:29] she made that decision more than once
[3:17:33] of where she wanted to be
[3:17:36] what she wanted to cling to
[3:17:40] Lord I ask you to remember her now
[3:17:44] father we recognize that if the angel of
[3:17:47] the Lord would visit her today

[3:17:53] there's nothing that can stand before
[3:17:55] your ordained will
[3:17:59] even cancer in all of his damage would
[3:18:01] have to bow
[3:18:03] to the sovereignty of our God
[3:18:06] Lord I hope you can see this
[3:18:08] congregation today and know that it is
[3:18:11] our deepest desire that you would give
[3:18:13] our sister this miracle
[3:18:16] that she might be able to be restored in
[3:18:19] body and spirit and mind
[3:18:22] father this is your word and you tell us
[3:18:24] to stand on your word and to believe
[3:18:26] your promise
[3:18:28] and that's what we're doing today
[3:18:31] but we remember your example
[3:18:36] nevertheless
[3:18:38] not my will Lord but your will be done
[3:18:42] I can't see five minutes into the future
[3:18:45] unless you would open my eyes
[3:18:47] but you've already seen the end and
[3:18:50] you've seen throughout all eternity
[3:18:53] and if this is the way Lord that it is
[3:18:55] to be we will bless your name
[3:18:58] the Lord gives the Lord takes away we
[3:19:00] will bless you we will praise you we
[3:19:03] will serve you and we will press on with
