[58:23] when we come into that corporate
[58:25] anointing
[58:26] how many of you think that
[58:29] chad the old pro
[58:31] how many of you think you did a great
[58:32] job this morning
[58:35] wonderful job
[58:36] [Applause]
[58:40] he's under medication he's on medication
[58:42] right now he had a spider bite for last
[58:46] week that
[58:47] caused a lot of pain and swelling and he
[58:49] went all week without doing anything
[58:51] about it and
[58:53] waited a long time and finally did and
[58:55] had to have an antibiotic and some other
[58:58] something to help him and
[58:59] when
[59:00] we decided that we would ask him not
[59:03] that ben doesn't do ben does a marvelous
[59:05] job
[59:06] and i i said to benjamin yesterday i
[59:09] said i want us to make sure that we
[59:10] don't
[59:12] hurt ben in any way
[59:14] because ben is dependable
[59:17] i can depend on him and i don't i didn't
[59:19] want him to think
[59:20] uh that we were replacing him on second
[59:23] string
[59:24] but i just it just came to me yesterday
[59:26] morning as we were trying to navigate
[59:28] kind of an unexpected shift that the
[59:31] boys and jenna wouldn't be here today
[59:32] and
[59:33] trying to figure out and i said let's
[59:35] ask chad and don't just tell him there's
[59:37] no pressure but if he would like to and
[59:40] then i heard about this
[59:41] uh
[59:42] visit to the er and and i thought well
[59:45] surely he won't but you know he was
[59:47] willing
[59:48] he came in with clammy hands
[59:51] he came in nervous i said you don't have
[59:53] to be nervous you've done this many
[59:55] times before even though it's been
[59:57] several years now and i enjoyed it so
[1:00:00] much
[1:00:01] that wonderful familiar
[1:00:03] uh that the presence of god that has
[1:00:06] always come when chad would lead us so
[1:00:08] we are blessed today
[1:00:11] but i do want did want to honor ben and
[1:00:13] say thank you for being so faithful
[1:00:14] always and and we will depend on you as
[1:00:17] we did already this morning for
[1:00:20] for uh leading the service and
[1:00:22] you know i i just appreciate anybody and
[1:00:25] then anna christine she didn't have any
[1:00:27] forewarning just a few minutes before
[1:00:29] the service started but i just
[1:00:31] appreciated that she was willing to do
[1:00:34] it and when the musicians weren't sure
[1:00:36] she just played for herself and and god
[1:00:38] just moved and he blessed and this is
[1:00:41] what we we can expect when people have a
[1:00:43] desire to do something for god
[1:00:46] he comes and blesses and we're missing
[1:00:49] all of those who are not here today i
[1:00:50] hope that you have been praying for
[1:00:52] brother and sister greeley as they
[1:00:54] minister today and i think there's two
[1:00:57] services today so they're probably well
[1:00:59] into their first service but there'll be
[1:01:01] another service this evening in erie
[1:01:03] pennsylvania may god move and bless them
[1:01:06] and uh sister teresa texted yesterday to
[1:01:09] say they were leaving indiana on their
[1:01:12] way over to pennsylvania to be there
[1:01:14] today for the services and uh i know
[1:01:18] luke's parents are mighty glad and
[1:01:20] i think kathy and her husband do they go
[1:01:22] there too or they just live in there
[1:01:23] they go to church there too so he's got
[1:01:26] family there
[1:01:27] and i know that god is going to meet
[1:01:29] them today in a wonderful way but we
[1:01:31] miss them
[1:01:33] and
[1:01:34] all of those who are not here so many
[1:01:36] were
[1:01:36] reaching out that they need prayer and
[1:01:38] touches in their body and i could use
[1:01:40] one too but he's the great physician
[1:01:43] all we have to do is call on him he's
[1:01:46] always ready to help us and strengthen
[1:01:48] us
[1:01:49] amen and i know some people are looking
[1:01:52] for a reason not to be but i'm looking
[1:01:54] for a reason to be
[1:01:56] i'm looking for a reason to be here
[1:01:58] i want to be here it's my place my post
[1:02:01] of duty and precious brother paul

[1:02:22] but he's here with us spiritually and in
[1:02:24] the spirit and saying amen and you think
[1:02:27] it doesn't make a difference it's a
[1:02:28] faith pool
[1:02:30] it's a faith pull
[1:02:31] brother reed texts us this morning to
[1:02:33] say he would be streaming and wouldn't
[1:02:35] be able to be here with us today but but
[1:02:37] uh he will be pulling his faith will be
[1:02:39] pulling

[1:02:43] few announcements that we need to make
[1:02:45] before we go to the word today and uh

[1:02:52] reason to pray and lift them up and i

[1:03:08] family time there and then tuesday ben

[1:03:46] but with with sister audrey not feeling
[1:03:48] good with that arthritis and they watch
[1:03:50] her to make sure she doesn't fall and so
[1:03:52] nakisha wasn't uh able to come today but

[1:04:12] i see where the writers are streaming in
[1:04:14] south africa and so we happen to notice
[1:04:17] that saturday is sister rona's birthday
[1:04:19] so we will say happy birthday to sister
[1:04:22] rona let's send them our love in south
[1:04:24] africa today
[1:04:29] how about we save brother shelly from
[1:04:32] having to get all kinds of texts this
[1:04:34] week
[1:04:35] uh over what time the services are
[1:04:38] sometimes i feel like i'm church
[1:04:40] secretary and i don't mind doing that
[1:04:42] when i don't have anything else to do
[1:04:44] but that's usually only for a few hours
[1:04:46] when i'm sleeping that i don't have
[1:04:48] something else to do so if everybody i'm
[1:04:51] not trying to you know treat you like
[1:04:53] school children but you'd be surprised
[1:04:55] i sometimes become a phone book and and
[1:04:59] then somebody would say well when is
[1:05:00] so-and-so's birthday you know well i i
[1:05:03] can't always stop what i'm doing to
[1:05:05] figure that out but when i can i will
[1:05:08] but we are looking forward to a
[1:05:09] wonderful weekend coming up with brother
[1:05:12] dwayne jackson
[1:05:14] he has blessed us here before he was our
[1:05:17] youth
[1:05:18] weekend speaker last year and we felt
[1:05:21] like
[1:05:22] that we wanted him to come and and and
[1:05:25] he's just down to earth and just real
[1:05:28] and we just appreciated
[1:05:30] the fact that he came in worshiping
[1:05:33] you know he didn't come in like some
[1:05:34] grand speaker that couldn't worship with
[1:05:37] us but he came in worshiping with us
[1:05:40] and you know that that right there will
[1:05:42] cause the people to have confidence in
[1:05:44] the ministry when it comes because
[1:05:46] you're watching to see how people will
[1:05:48] enter right in to the spirit of the lord
[1:05:51] and both he and sister heather certainly
[1:05:53] do that and they're going to be coming
[1:05:55] with a a smile on their face and and so
[1:05:59] much to thank god for in the miracle
[1:06:02] birth of of little liam and we can't
[1:06:05] wait to meet him
[1:06:06] and uh so on friday evening this week
[1:06:09] there is a banquet for our younger
[1:06:12] people for young people there it's by
[1:06:14] invitation only meaning that we didn't
[1:06:16] invite a whole lot of extra parents and
[1:06:18] a whole lot of extra people because
[1:06:21] we're trying to do it as low budget as
[1:06:22] possible but it's not because we don't
[1:06:24] want you we wish we could just banquet
[1:06:27] with everybody but if we did then the
[1:06:30] young married couples would have to uh
[1:06:32] bring their children and this is one
[1:06:34] night out of the year that we can help
[1:06:38] uh make sure that they have something to
[1:06:40] go to and it's not there's no harm at
[1:06:42] all in them being away from their
[1:06:44] children just a few hours and thank you
[1:06:47] nannies and mimi's and
[1:06:50] aunties and whatever else for helping
[1:06:52] the kids come and dress up
[1:06:55] and i don't know why anybody would want
[1:06:56] to dress up like that but anyway they do
[1:06:58] and they enjoy doing it and so we come
[1:07:01] we'll be doing that on friday evening
[1:07:03] but everyone is invited to worship with
[1:07:06] us next saturday evening at seven
[1:07:08] o'clock
[1:07:09] and everyone is invited to come on
[1:07:12] saturday while the young people are uh
[1:07:14] playing ball and having fellowship with
[1:07:17] one another there'll be breakfast also a
[1:07:19] brunch
[1:07:20] uh in the morning
[1:07:22] and and the service at seven
[1:07:25] and we started a little bit later
[1:07:27] because it was real difficult to get
[1:07:28] everybody in here for six o'clock last
[1:07:31] time and since church is at 11 even if
[1:07:34] we go till midnight on saturday night
[1:07:36] we'll still be able to come into the
[1:07:39] house of the lord and hear what god is
[1:07:40] laid on brother jackson's heart for next
[1:07:43] sunday i'm looking forward to it
[1:07:45] i believe god's going to meet with us
[1:07:48] and i'm excited about that and then
[1:07:50] again camp meeting is october the 11th
[1:07:53] through the 16th
[1:07:55] it's unfortunate that brother brooks
[1:07:57] will not be able to be with us this year
[1:07:59] but we committed every bit of that to
[1:08:02] the lord we just gave it to god and we
[1:08:05] started praying and asking the lord what
[1:08:07] to do about
[1:08:08] someone else to come in and and to speak
[1:08:12] and we haven't gotten anything yet
[1:08:15] and it's getting right down to the to
[1:08:17] the nitty-gritty
[1:08:19] and uh but it's in the lord's hands
[1:08:22] he knows exactly what we need for that
[1:08:24] week
[1:08:25] and i wouldn't i wouldn't be
[1:08:27] disappointed if i were you because i'm
[1:08:30] very sure the lord will be here
[1:08:32] and i believe he's going to meet needs
[1:08:35] the lord reveals a theme to my heart he
[1:08:37] made it so real from psalm 66 5
[1:08:42] it says come and see that's the theme
[1:08:44] for camp this year come and see
[1:08:47] the works of god he is awesome in his
[1:08:50] doing toward the sons of men how many of
[1:08:53] you can say amen so come and see
[1:08:57] i think i was reading from the new king
[1:08:59] james because that word terrible
[1:09:02] uh
[1:09:03] in the king james throws people off
[1:09:06] it it means awesome and full of power
[1:09:10] it doesn't mean terrible like a stomach
[1:09:12] ache how many of you know that so we
[1:09:14] have a lot to look forward to
[1:09:17] and then i'm going to be speaking in a
[1:09:19] meeting the end of october in north
[1:09:22] carolina
[1:09:23] and we'll let you know about that for
[1:09:25] any of you who might want to travel that
[1:09:27] weekend to be with some very old friends
[1:09:30] of ours we're looking forward to it in a
[1:09:32] place we've never ministered before
[1:09:34] but we believe that god's going to move
[1:09:36] and that will be the last weekend of
[1:09:38] october and it's about five and a half
[1:09:41] hours away something like that close to
[1:09:43] six hours away we'll give you more
[1:09:45] details later but we believe god's going
[1:09:47] to move in those meetings as well
[1:09:49] i had to clear the weekend with brother
[1:09:51] greeley to make sure that he would be
[1:09:53] here to preach for me and you know what
[1:09:56] he said he said what if i wanted to go
[1:10:04] i said well it's only five and a half
[1:10:06] hours away you can come friday night
[1:10:08] he said don't think i hadn't thought
[1:10:10] about it
[1:10:11] so uh
[1:10:13] if we if we all go if we all just go
[1:10:16] then we wouldn't even have to have a
[1:10:17] service here but we want that in god's
[1:10:20] hands whatever he wants
[1:10:22] let's thank the lord for the musicians
[1:10:24] god bless them bless them
[1:10:27] pour it on them lord
[1:10:32] let's stand
[1:10:34] ephesians
[1:10:36] chapter 2.
[1:10:38] god bless all of you streamers we
[1:10:41] see some who are
[1:10:43] the arnold's family from
[1:10:45] from france may god bless you all
[1:10:48] we love that family and this is some of
[1:10:51] their family i think and we're just so
[1:10:53] thankful to have them with us today
[1:10:55] ephesians
[1:10:56] chapter 2 are you ready for the word
[1:11:02] verse 15
[1:11:05] having abolished
[1:11:07] in his flesh
[1:11:09] the
[1:11:10] enmity even the law of commandments
[1:11:14] contained in ordinances
[1:11:18] for to make in himself of twain
[1:11:22] one new man
[1:11:25] so
[1:11:25] making peace hold on
[1:11:29] i want you to look at this very
[1:11:31] carefully
[1:11:33] because this is a key
[1:11:36] to understanding how god is dealing with
[1:11:39] mankind in the end
[1:11:42] he's not dealing with with a group of
[1:11:44] people
[1:11:45] uh one way and another group of people
[1:11:47] another way he's making one new man
[1:11:50] the blood of jesus christ the blood of
[1:11:53] yeshua the messiah has made us one
[1:11:57] and we didn't come to this great
[1:11:59] work of redemption to be driven back to
[1:12:03] ordinances of men
[1:12:05] now the commandments of god that's one
[1:12:07] thing
[1:12:10] but modern judaism is corrupt
[1:12:14] i want you to understand that it's
[1:12:15] corrupt it's magical
[1:12:18] it's rooted in a lot of
[1:12:21] ugly stuff
[1:12:22] i was at the car wash i know you're
[1:12:25] standing i was at the car wash the other
[1:12:27] day with benjamin and and there was a
[1:12:29] boy there with a hamsa on his
[1:12:31] on his necklace and i thought to myself
[1:12:34] i said to benjamin i wonder if he even
[1:12:35] knows what that is it's sort of a charm
[1:12:38] that some of the jewish people wear
[1:12:40] those who are involved in kabbalah
[1:12:42] and i said he probably doesn't even know
[1:12:45] that he is attracting witchcraft
[1:12:48] spirits
[1:12:50] he just sees that and and sometimes
[1:12:52] people so long to be identified with the
[1:12:55] jewish people that they'll just do all
[1:12:57] kinds of things to try to identify
[1:12:59] themselves but this is serious business
[1:13:02] so we're not coming to judaism
[1:13:05] no god's not bringing us to that he's
[1:13:07] bringing us to his word
[1:13:10] and so just understand that the
[1:13:12] commandments of god are one thing the
[1:13:14] ordinances
[1:13:16] some
[1:13:17] of which could not be kept even in this
[1:13:20] hour because there's no temple
[1:13:22] so people really get hung up sometime
[1:13:25] and they miss
[1:13:26] what god is doing we we even have
[1:13:29] friends who uh who have come to the
[1:13:32] message and and now they think there's
[1:13:34] something so much more than the message
[1:13:36] of truth i want you to know something
[1:13:38] when god kept his word and sent an
[1:13:42] understanding and revelation of his word
[1:13:44] in the end time that's it
[1:13:49] we're not looking for a new revelation
[1:13:51] we're looking for more understanding
[1:13:54] of what god has already revealed don't
[1:13:56] get weak on me
[1:13:58] let's be strong in this
[1:14:00] so let's look at this carefully having
[1:14:02] abolished in his flesh
[1:14:05] because he fulfilled
[1:14:07] a whole lot of commandments in an
[1:14:09] ordinances by his flesh having abolished
[1:14:12] in his flesh the enmity even the law of
[1:14:15] commandments contained in ordinances for
[1:14:17] to make in himself of twain one new man
[1:14:22] so making peace
[1:14:24] and that he might reconcile both this is
[1:14:28] jew and gentile unto god in one body hal
[1:14:33] by the cross
[1:14:34] having slain the enmity thereby
[1:14:40] religion is no longer there to divide
[1:14:42] the one new man
[1:14:44] and came and preached peace to you which
[1:14:48] were afar off how many of you know
[1:14:50] that's most of us
[1:14:52] most of us in the in the nations the
[1:14:55] the gentiles and came and preached
[1:14:58] peace to you which were afar off and to
[1:15:01] them that were nigh
[1:15:04] for through him listen
[1:15:06] through him
[1:15:12] no other way
[1:15:15] we both have access
[1:15:18] by one spirit
[1:15:19] unto the father
[1:15:21] oh that's good
[1:15:23] now therefore ye are no more strangers
[1:15:27] and foreigners but fellow citizens with
[1:15:31] the saints and what
[1:15:35] of the household of
[1:15:36] god and are built upon the foundation of
[1:15:41] the apostles and prophets
[1:15:45] jesus christ himself being what
[1:15:51] wow
[1:15:53] the foundation is apostles and prophets
[1:15:57] but the cornerstone
[1:15:59] the one who ties it all together
[1:16:02] the strength of the building
[1:16:04] is found in jesus christ
[1:16:06] if you believe that say amen
[1:16:08] and then a few more verses here in whom
[1:16:10] all the building fitly framed together
[1:16:15] groweth unto a holy temple in the lord
[1:16:19] oh what a temple he's building
[1:16:22] in whom ye also are builded together for
[1:16:27] an habitation of god through
[1:16:31] the spirit
[1:16:33] building up a people we are living
[1:16:36] stones
[1:16:38] we are lively stones
[1:16:40] we are the temple of the most high god
[1:16:44] do you believe that
[1:16:45] now before you're seated i know you're
[1:16:47] standing but before you're seated let's
[1:16:49] read just two verses 21 and 22 in the
[1:16:53] amplified
[1:16:55] watch this
[1:16:57] in him
[1:16:59] the whole structure
[1:17:01] is joined
[1:17:03] bound
[1:17:04] welded together
[1:17:07] can you all say that word
[1:17:10] harmoniously
[1:17:14] harmony
[1:17:17] [Music]
[1:17:19] like a song
[1:17:21] join together no ism
[1:17:25] no schism
[1:17:27] you understand
[1:17:29] no division
[1:17:30] what does division mean
[1:17:32] two visions
[1:17:34] one vision to lead us
[1:17:37] join together in christ
[1:17:40] not some special way made for one and
[1:17:43] another way for the other but joined
[1:17:45] together
[1:17:46] standing together built together
[1:17:49] harmoniously hallelujah
[1:17:52] in him the whole structure is joined
[1:17:54] bound welded together harmoniously and
[1:17:58] it continues to rise
[1:18:00] that's what i want you to know he's
[1:18:03] still building a holy habitation
[1:18:05] he's still building a holy temple
[1:18:08] continues to rise to grow to increase
[1:18:13] into a holy temple in the lord
[1:18:16] a sanctuary dedicated that's us
[1:18:21] that's not the building it's the
[1:18:23] building
[1:18:24] a sanctuary dedicated consecrated and
[1:18:28] sacred to the presence of the lord no
[1:18:32] wonder he can come
[1:18:34] no wonder his presence can fill this
[1:18:36] house because he's building a house here
[1:18:39] he's building a habitation here he's
[1:18:42] building a dwelling place here
[1:18:44] consecrated sanctified sacred to the
[1:18:48] presence of the lord dedicated as a
[1:18:51] witness and as a welcome to his spirit
[1:18:54] to come we want him
[1:18:56] we want him
[1:18:58] we're not going back to a dead letter we
[1:19:00] want him we want to live in christ
[1:19:03] we want a living word among us
[1:19:06] one who can do the same today
[1:19:09] that he did yesterday
[1:19:10] he's it goes on to say in him
[1:19:14] and
[1:19:15] in fellowship
[1:19:17] with one another
[1:19:21] no ism
[1:19:23] oh is there things that come up to
[1:19:24] divide us
[1:19:25] all the time
[1:19:27] then what was what must we do refuse
[1:19:35] we must refuse to be divided
[1:19:38] we refuse to be divided
[1:19:40] we refuse to let something divide us now
[1:19:43] in fellowship one with another you
[1:19:45] yourselves are being built up into this
[1:19:48] structure
[1:19:49] with the rest
[1:19:51] to form a fixed
[1:19:53] abode
[1:19:55] a dwelling place what house will you
[1:19:57] build me
[1:19:58] a to form a fixed abode a dwelling place
[1:20:02] of god in
[1:20:05] by
[1:20:06] through
[1:20:07] the spirit
[1:20:08] let me ask you how is god building a
[1:20:11] habitation and a temple to dwell in he's
[1:20:14] doing it by
[1:20:16] the spirit
[1:20:18] somebody said i thought it was by the
[1:20:20] word the word is a letter
[1:20:23] until the spirit breeds life you know
[1:20:26] that that's not taking away from the
[1:20:28] word the word must take preeminence
[1:20:30] among us but not the letter of the word
[1:20:34] the living reality of the word
[1:20:37] it's not the letter of the word that
[1:20:39] gives us a testimony it's the living
[1:20:41] reality of the word that gives us
[1:20:43] something to praise for are you with me
[1:20:46] father thank you right now that you are
[1:20:49] the living reality of the word
[1:20:51] you are the word
[1:20:53] and you are the living reality by the
[1:20:55] spirit of the word to each and every one
[1:20:58] of us
[1:20:59] we have not entered into religion we
[1:21:02] have entered into relationship and
[1:21:04] relationship is not by letter it's by
[1:21:08] spirit fellowship is not by regulation
[1:21:11] it's by the spirit so we welcome again
[1:21:14] and again and again and again the pure
[1:21:18] holy spirit of god to come and manifest
[1:21:22] himself in this house to lead us in the
[1:21:25] song to lead us in the worship to lead
[1:21:28] us in whatever direction the mind of god
[1:21:31] would take us for the rest of this
[1:21:33] service
[1:21:34] if the spirit of god should highlight
[1:21:37] someone who needs prayer let us be led
[1:21:40] let us have grace to follow that
[1:21:42] leadership
[1:21:44] let nothing divide
[1:21:46] let nothing cause division
[1:21:50] or for fellowship to be broken but may
[1:21:53] god just come and build us together lord
[1:21:56] may we find victory over the battle of
[1:21:59] the mind
[1:22:00] and we will give you glory and honor and
[1:22:02] praise for the church of jesus christ
[1:22:04] said what
[1:22:06] amen
[1:22:09] you may be seated
[1:22:13] this is why
[1:22:15] winning the mind battle is so important
[1:22:18] because the mind battle comes to
[1:22:21] accomplish two things
[1:22:23] it comes to separate you from christ
[1:22:27] and it comes to separate you from one
[1:22:30] another
[1:22:34] you see he comes to divide us
[1:22:37] from christ
[1:22:39] to isolate us
[1:22:41] from the reality of the word
[1:22:43] he comes also this mind battle this this
[1:22:47] enemy who comes to march against our
[1:22:50] mind and our thoughts he comes to divide
[1:22:53] us from god to separate us from our
[1:22:56] origin
[1:22:58] you see i came from god
[1:23:00] you understand that don't you and i'm
[1:23:02] going back to god
[1:23:04] if the enemy can separate me from my
[1:23:06] origin he separates me from my daily
[1:23:09] existence
[1:23:12] and so my relationship with christ if my
[1:23:14] relationship with christ is broken i'm
[1:23:17] no longer i'm no longer overcoming
[1:23:19] anything
[1:23:21] in fact i'm barely getting by i'm barely
[1:23:24] surviving
[1:23:25] i don't even know if you could call me a
[1:23:27] survivor once i'm separated from my life
[1:23:31] i'm withering on the vine
[1:23:33] i'm preaching to you this morning don't
[1:23:35] you wither on the vine
[1:23:38] hello stay connected to christ
[1:23:41] no matter what it costs you no matter
[1:23:43] what you have to put aside maybe your
[1:23:46] pride you have to lay pride aside maybe
[1:23:49] you have to reorder the priorities of
[1:23:52] your life maybe you have to put feelings
[1:23:55] aside remember brother branham tells us
[1:23:58] what does feelings have to do with it
[1:24:01] how many of you know that people can't
[1:24:02] talk without telling you how they feel
[1:24:05] well i feel well i feel well i feel well
[1:24:07] i feel well i feel you know you ought to
[1:24:09] just shock them sometime
[1:24:12] and you ought to just say what's feeling
[1:24:14] got to do with it
[1:24:16] somebody said i don't feel worthy what's
[1:24:19] feeling got to do with it
[1:24:21] somebody said i don't feel well i feel
[1:24:23] sick what's feeling got to do with it i
[1:24:26] don't feel like an overcomer what's
[1:24:28] feeling got to do with it
[1:24:30] it's a promise from the father i tell
[1:24:33] you man will lie to you but the word
[1:24:36] will never lie
[1:24:38] it'll never lie to us
[1:24:40] it'll stand when the world is on fire
[1:24:43] your carnal mind will make excuse
[1:24:47] for allowing the enemy
[1:24:50] to separate you from your origin
[1:24:54] oh he'll justify the enemy will justify
[1:24:56] everything he's a great sophist the
[1:24:59] prophet tells us
[1:25:01] he's a great arguer
[1:25:03] he knows how to argue he knows how to
[1:25:05] present his case he knows how to
[1:25:07] persuade us
[1:25:09] come on now but we've got to possess the
[1:25:11] reins of our mind
[1:25:13] i'm going to possess the reins of my
[1:25:18] mind i will not allow satan to be in
[1:25:21] control of the reigns of my mind how
[1:25:24] many of you know whoever's got the
[1:25:26] horse's reigns
[1:25:29] that's the one that's directing the
[1:25:30] horse
[1:25:31] if satan has the reins of your mind he
[1:25:34] is directing you
[1:25:40] that's just simple
[1:25:42] you seem kind of
[1:25:44] uh
[1:25:45] intent i am i feel a little intense
[1:25:47] i feel a little intense i feel like
[1:25:49] there's a battle going on
[1:25:51] how many of you how many of you slept
[1:25:53] like a baby last night let me see your
[1:25:55] hand
[1:25:57] where'd you come from
[1:26:01] i knew if i did it the other way around
[1:26:03] i might i might i might influence your
[1:26:05] answer
[1:26:07] so i wanted to get those of you who
[1:26:08] slept like a baby and i'm so thankful
[1:26:11] that you were not on watch
[1:26:12] you got to rest
[1:26:14] but i didn't have that pleasure last
[1:26:16] night
[1:26:17] how many of you get a night sometime
[1:26:19] where it's just like a a night of naps
[1:26:23] just every five minutes and you you look
[1:26:25] at your watch and you say my lord have
[1:26:27] mercy it's only been four minutes
[1:26:32] your door's off and you wake up and you
[1:26:34] think whoa i've slept two hours you look
[1:26:36] 10 minutes
[1:26:38] well that was my night last night and i
[1:26:39] knew and i said to my wife and the first
[1:26:41] thing my wife asked me every morning or
[1:26:43] if i get a chance i ask her first thing
[1:26:45] in the morning while we're still in bed
[1:26:47] did you rest well last night
[1:26:49] and when she asked me i you know
[1:26:51] sometimes you don't tell her exactly
[1:26:53] like it is
[1:26:54] and she said did you did you rest well
[1:26:57] last night i said no i did not did you
[1:27:00] she said no i did not
[1:27:02] i said it felt like a night of naps i
[1:27:04] knew when i woke up this morning and
[1:27:07] could hardly wake up
[1:27:10] because i just napped through the night
[1:27:11] now it's time to get up and your body
[1:27:14] thinks it's time to sleep you've been
[1:27:15] there
[1:27:16] how many of you had that kind of night
[1:27:18] last night let me see your hand
[1:27:20] sometimes it's what you ate
[1:27:23] you can't make everything spiritual
[1:27:27] but since they serve thai food in heaven
[1:27:31] i know it wasn't my thai food that did
[1:27:33] it to me
[1:27:35] i knew that there was something else
[1:27:37] going on
[1:27:38] and so it made me a little intense
[1:27:41] it made me mad i tell you i'm mad i'm
[1:27:44] not mad at anybody i'm not mad at
[1:27:47] anybody here i'm not mad at anybody
[1:27:49] streaming this service i'm mad at the
[1:27:52] enemy
[1:27:53] because i know that he is slick and sly
[1:27:57] and he's trying to divide us from our
[1:28:00] source of life
[1:28:02] and then he wants to divide us from one
[1:28:05] another
[1:28:06] and sometimes he does it in another
[1:28:08] order sometimes he tries to divide us
[1:28:11] from each other and then he tries to cut
[1:28:13] off our source of life we must make up
[1:28:15] our mind that we're a part of a building
[1:28:18] that's being fitly framed and joined
[1:28:20] together i tell you what i delight i
[1:28:24] delight in the thought of making the
[1:28:27] enemy's plans and plots fail what you
[1:28:31] have meant to do to divide or to hinder
[1:28:34] or to keep us defeated and discouraged
[1:28:37] and depressed in every trick that you
[1:28:39] have tried to play on us i rejoice in
[1:28:42] knowing that you will ultimately be
[1:28:44] defeated and the bride of jesus christ
[1:28:48] will continue to grow up into that holy
[1:28:51] temple dedicated consecrated set apart
[1:28:55] for the sacred to the presence of the
[1:28:58] lord
[1:28:59] so you can huff and puff and try to blow
[1:29:01] the house down but what you don't
[1:29:03] remember sometime is it's built on the
[1:29:05] foundation of the apostles and the
[1:29:07] prophets the bride will stand
[1:29:10] she will stand
[1:29:12] she's built on the word and the lord
[1:29:15] jesus christ is the chief cornerstone
[1:29:18] holding it locking it all together
[1:29:21] so you tell the devil you're going to
[1:29:23] possess the reigns of your own mind
[1:29:29] boy i almost shocked some of you just a
[1:29:31] minute ago
[1:29:32] i almost said something i'd have
[1:29:34] regretted later
[1:29:36] i caught myself
[1:29:40] sometimes i feel like asking this
[1:29:41] question
[1:29:43] i'll clean it up
[1:29:46] i got your attention now don't i
[1:29:49] i'll clean it up for you
[1:29:50] sometime i just like to ask people whose
[1:29:52] donkey are you
[1:29:56] just just think about it a minute
[1:29:58] hmm
[1:30:03] you getting it
[1:30:05] who's who's driving you around
[1:30:08] who's riding on your back
[1:30:11] how long are you going to give him a
[1:30:12] saddle to ride in
[1:30:14] how long are you going to surrender the
[1:30:16] reins of your own mind to the one that's
[1:30:18] out to destroy you make up your mind
[1:30:21] today i'm going to possess them myself
[1:30:24] i'm not on a runaway train i'm not on a
[1:30:27] runaway donkey
[1:30:29] i'm not riding i'm not a runaway horse
[1:30:31] no siree
[1:30:34] i'm a thoroughbred
[1:30:36] and when that word goes forth i know
[1:30:38] exactly what i must do to line myself up
[1:30:41] with that are you ready
[1:30:43] all right now i want us to go here
[1:30:47] uh
[1:30:48] let me find the place where i want us to
[1:30:50] jump in
[1:30:52] we're we're we've covered paradigms
[1:30:54] pretty good would you go to slide 31
[1:30:57] and uh that's probably in paradigms i'm
[1:30:59] not 100 sure
[1:31:04] yes that's it
[1:31:06] now these are different than what we
[1:31:07] have had in the past so it's gonna be a
[1:31:08] little bit harder for you to see all of
[1:31:10] that it is for me anyway
[1:31:12] so let's look at this quote accept god's
[1:31:14] gift tallahassee florida he said now
[1:31:17] healing
[1:31:19] is not something that you just say
[1:31:22] well i believe it i believe it
[1:31:24] now that's all right
[1:31:26] if that's the best you can do just
[1:31:28] mentally
[1:31:29] or just say well yes i see it i believe
[1:31:31] that i accept it
[1:31:33] then if you accept it on those basis
[1:31:38] you've got to accept it first
[1:31:41] god said i'm going to give you total
[1:31:42] deliverance total deliverance god said
[1:31:45] i'm going to heal your body
[1:31:47] god said i'm going to give you a mind
[1:31:49] that is sound
[1:31:53] how many of you believe you can have a
[1:31:55] sound mind
[1:31:56] in a crazy world
[1:31:58] don't leave me
[1:31:59] stay with me
[1:32:01] you've got to accept that truth
[1:32:04] you've got to believe that truth
[1:32:06] that's the a the b
[1:32:08] and then you've got to be willing to
[1:32:09] confess that truth and here's how
[1:32:12] brother branham tells us that we will
[1:32:14] confess it remember remember that a
[1:32:16] paradigm is something that is formed by
[1:32:20] a
[1:32:21] repetitious pattern of thought
[1:32:24] you keep thinking it over and over and
[1:32:27] over again until it molds you into a
[1:32:30] paradigm
[1:32:32] and repetition is how it got built
[1:32:35] and repetition is how we're going to
[1:32:37] tear it down that's what brother
[1:32:39] branham's talking about here in just a
[1:32:41] moment he said what you you accept it on
[1:32:44] those bases you keep saying it over and
[1:32:47] over
[1:32:49] he said say it out loud
[1:32:54] now i want to tell you there's power in
[1:32:55] that
[1:32:57] there's power in that brother brandon
[1:32:58] wasn't a neuroscientist but i tell you
[1:33:00] what he had some spiritual insight to
[1:33:03] how the mind and the brain work
[1:33:06] and it's not enough to say it inside
[1:33:09] it's not enough to say it to yourself
[1:33:12] did you know that every cell in your
[1:33:14] body is created to respond to the sound
[1:33:18] of your voice
[1:33:20] when god created you he tuned your body
[1:33:23] to your voice
[1:33:24] not mine
[1:33:28] not mine
[1:33:30] not your husbands
[1:33:33] not your wives
[1:33:35] he tuned your body
[1:33:37] your voice
[1:33:39] and your body
[1:33:41] together
[1:33:43] every cell in your body responds to the
[1:33:47] sound of your voice
[1:33:51] that's why as we mentioned tuesday night
[1:33:53] we cannot say this headache is killing
[1:33:56] me
[1:33:58] because we throw every cell in our body
[1:34:02] into a panic
[1:34:04] wait a minute brother shelly you you you
[1:34:07] seem to be indicating that even a cell
[1:34:10] has intelligence it does
[1:34:13] every cell in your body has a brain
[1:34:17] now we're saying this figuratively
[1:34:19] but scientifically it has a memory and
[1:34:22] in order for a cell to have a memory it
[1:34:25] has to have the ability to retain a
[1:34:28] thought
[1:34:29] are you with me
[1:34:30] and so when we speak words of chaos
[1:34:33] every cell in our body is covered by a
[1:34:37] wash
[1:34:39] of chaos
[1:34:40] but when we speak words of life
[1:34:44] every cell in our body must respond to
[1:34:48] that life because it's the word of the
[1:34:50] creator we're speaking
[1:34:52] that's why it's not just the power of
[1:34:53] positive thinking it's the power of
[1:34:55] thinking the word
[1:34:57] it's not just the power of speaking
[1:34:58] something positive it's the power of
[1:35:01] speaking the word
[1:35:02] because when you were created remember
[1:35:04] what your origin was you were once a
[1:35:07] thought in the mind of god
[1:35:08] when god expressed you he spoke you
[1:35:12] so you are a product of a thought that
[1:35:15] became a spoken word is that right and
[1:35:18] so when you were created thus every cell
[1:35:22] in your body has the ability to respond
[1:35:25] to the sound of your voice
[1:35:28] so it's not enough for your wife to say
[1:35:30] you're healed honey you're healed you're
[1:35:32] healed you've got to begin to confess
[1:35:34] that over your own body
[1:35:36] anybody with me brother branham said
[1:35:38] keep saying it over and over say it out
[1:35:41] loud say it over and over i'm just
[1:35:43] quoting
[1:35:44] he said just keep saying i'm healed i'm
[1:35:47] healed
[1:35:49] say it until actually you believe it
[1:35:52] how many of you get that
[1:35:54] see you're first saying it because you
[1:35:55] know you're supposed to
[1:35:58] you know it works
[1:35:59] you've got a mental concept that there's
[1:36:02] power in what i confess over my own body
[1:36:04] you got that but the more you begin to
[1:36:06] say it the more your faith attaches to
[1:36:09] it and when your faith attaches to it
[1:36:12] your cells start responding
[1:36:14] oh yes
[1:36:16] how many of you know that's how cancer
[1:36:17] works in the body
[1:36:18] it affects one cell
[1:36:21] it doesn't have to find a clump of cells
[1:36:23] it can form a tumor later it just finds
[1:36:25] one
[1:36:27] it finds a weak cell
[1:36:29] one that's already in the process of
[1:36:31] dying
[1:36:32] because our cells die often
[1:36:35] and they are we we have new cells
[1:36:37] created in our body all the time
[1:36:39] including brain cells
[1:36:41] did you know for thousands of years the
[1:36:43] world did not believe in epigenetics
[1:36:46] the scientists did not believe that you
[1:36:48] could develop a better brain than the
[1:36:50] one you were born with
[1:36:53] they believe that you were absolutely
[1:36:55] bound to live with the thinking capacity
[1:36:57] that you were born with
[1:36:59] but through the science of epigenetics
[1:37:01] they begin to understand that not only
[1:37:04] can you begin to change and expand your
[1:37:06] ability to think clearly
[1:37:09] there is no limit to what you can
[1:37:11] contain
[1:37:13] because as you begin to ask the spirit
[1:37:16] of god to expand you and i tell you i'm
[1:37:18] already at the age where i'm asking him
[1:37:22] lord i need new brain cells
[1:37:25] healthy brain cells charged with the
[1:37:28] life of jesus christ
[1:37:30] i want a brain that's always growing
[1:37:34] and a mind an ability to remember and an
[1:37:36] ability to speak and an ability to have
[1:37:39] clarity clarity
[1:37:41] and and we're doing that we're literally
[1:37:43] now we see scientifically it's possible
[1:37:46] the word is always said it was god spoke
[1:37:48] to the prophet before people were even
[1:37:50] understanding what epigenetics was so
[1:37:53] you've got a little bride here on planet
[1:37:55] earth that's beginning to speak to her
[1:37:57] circumstances
[1:37:59] remember what he said
[1:38:01] in that authority of the spoken word you
[1:38:03] would be able to create a world
[1:38:08] he said step out into it and inhabit
[1:38:10] that world
[1:38:11] well really that's what we're doing
[1:38:14] we're actually trying to do that even
[1:38:16] now
[1:38:17] you follow what i'm saying
[1:38:19] because we look around at our
[1:38:20] circumstances and we see how adverse
[1:38:22] they are and we begin to reject them
[1:38:25] i'm not going to live in depression all
[1:38:26] my life
[1:38:28] i'm not going to live addicted to food
[1:38:30] all my life i'm not going to live
[1:38:32] addicted to this all my life i'm not
[1:38:34] going to be under this all my life we
[1:38:35] begin to speak those things and mean
[1:38:37] them
[1:38:38] and we say them based on the word not
[1:38:40] just because it's a good positive
[1:38:41] thought we begin to say it based on the
[1:38:43] word what the word said the living word
[1:38:46] not the letter the living word
[1:38:48] which is the truth that the spirit is in
[1:38:51] because we worship god not only in truth
[1:38:54] but we worship god in spirit also
[1:38:57] isn't that wonderful
[1:38:59] oh that's why worship is so important
[1:39:02] because every time you worship you're
[1:39:04] brought into the presence of your
[1:39:05] creator
[1:39:07] every time you connect with god in the
[1:39:08] atmosphere of his anointing you are
[1:39:10] brought one you're made one again you're
[1:39:13] coming into oneness again with him
[1:39:16] and everything that he is it's like it's
[1:39:18] like taking your head off
[1:39:20] and putting his head on your shoulder
[1:39:23] it is
[1:39:24] and everything that he is begins to flow
[1:39:26] through the veins of your body and your
[1:39:28] mind and your every every capillary the
[1:39:31] the very life of jesus christ listen
[1:39:33] this is what changed abraham
[1:39:36] this is what changed sarah's
[1:39:38] body if god can bring a children of
[1:39:41] israel dropping group bellyaching and
[1:39:43] complaining if he can bring them through
[1:39:45] a wilderness and there was not one sick
[1:39:48] among them
[1:39:50] what do you think he ought to be able to
[1:39:51] do with the people that are living under
[1:39:53] the restored word
[1:39:55] hello
[1:39:58] somebody said well we're not seeing it
[1:39:59] yet are you going to wait to jump aboard
[1:40:02] when you see it
[1:40:03] are you going to take it by faith and do
[1:40:05] what he tells us to do and you're just
[1:40:07] going to start speaking what the word
[1:40:10] said
[1:40:14] i'm so depressed i can hardly live
[1:40:20] even if it's the truth
[1:40:23] be careful how it comes out of your
[1:40:25] mouth
[1:40:27] because your subconscious mind doesn't
[1:40:28] know when you're joking
[1:40:30] so your cells receive whatever it is
[1:40:32] that you're speaking over the only thing
[1:40:34] you can do is reprogram by truth
[1:40:38] which is
[1:40:42] did you know that brain i don't want to
[1:40:44] get into this but did you know that
[1:40:45] brain scientists tell us
[1:40:47] that thoughts
[1:40:48] that have become deeply embedded and
[1:40:51] ingrained in the real estate of our
[1:40:54] brain did you know
[1:40:56] that thoughts
[1:40:58] like like neurons and dendrites
[1:41:02] they become permanent
[1:41:05] they take a permanent spay a thought
[1:41:09] can take up permanent space
[1:41:12] in your brain
[1:41:13] in the form of a dendrite
[1:41:16] and did you know that every time you
[1:41:18] revisit that thought
[1:41:21] it's like a tree caroline
[1:41:23] uh uh says what's your last name
[1:41:27] leif
[1:41:28] she says that every time you visit that
[1:41:31] thought
[1:41:32] again
[1:41:33] it's like adding growth
[1:41:37] it literally expands
[1:41:39] but did you know that god has made you
[1:41:41] better than a supercomputer
[1:41:44] and you also have the ability to cause a
[1:41:46] thought to leave your brain real estate
[1:41:50] by refusing to revisit that again and
[1:41:52] again and again
[1:41:54] that eventually with no brain activity
[1:41:56] and no neurons flowing through it it
[1:41:59] will leave your brain
[1:42:02] somebody said you couldn't prove it by
[1:42:04] me do you know why because we keep
[1:42:06] revisiting those things
[1:42:09] we keep going back to those things over
[1:42:12] and over and over again
[1:42:21] i'm just looking around i'm missing some
[1:42:23] folks in the service i'm wondering
[1:42:33] he said just keep saying i'm healed i'm
[1:42:36] healed
[1:42:37] say it until you actually believe it
[1:42:41] and when you believe it
[1:42:43] then it's going to take place
[1:42:47] don't have a negative
[1:42:50] testimony
[1:42:52] every time when you confess well i still
[1:42:55] feel bad today
[1:42:58] i guess you go right straight back in
[1:43:00] the same rut
[1:43:04] how many of you respect what he's
[1:43:05] telling us
[1:43:07] you go back to the same rut that you was
[1:43:09] in the beginning
[1:43:12] there's not a man or woman in here
[1:43:13] that's baptized with the holy spirit
[1:43:16] but what would start your confession i
[1:43:19] believe i've lost the holy spirit
[1:43:21] who would say such a thing
[1:43:26] who would say such a thing i believe
[1:43:28] i've lost the holy spirit i believe it's
[1:43:30] gone from me
[1:43:33] he said you'll go right down
[1:43:38] don't ever say it
[1:43:40] well what do i do if i feel like the
[1:43:42] holy spirit is is leaving me or draining
[1:43:45] out of me or i need a refilling of the
[1:43:47] holy ghost you run here
[1:43:50] you run up here to worship the lord and
[1:43:52] you say fill me up
[1:43:56] i want to be plugged in
[1:44:00] i want to be recharged by your spirit of
[1:44:03] but don't ever say don't ever say don't
[1:44:05] ever let it come out of your mouth
[1:44:08] he said there's no no holy ghost-filled
[1:44:10] christian that would make that kind of a
[1:44:11] profession would come up here and say
[1:44:13] the holy ghost is gone from me
[1:44:16] now in the message why are you ready to
[1:44:18] move on he said now bow your heads
[1:44:24] you may not have this one
[1:44:26] it just dawned on me i don't have a
[1:44:28] slide number here so you may not have it
[1:44:30] but i'm going to oh you do all right
[1:44:32] i probably picked it up a little bit
[1:44:34] further down
[1:44:36] let me see make sure that's it
[1:44:38] um
[1:44:40] i don't know if that's it or not
[1:44:43] but i'll start reading and if you find
[1:44:44] if you if you see that i'm reading the
[1:44:46] same you you can flash that one up he
[1:44:48] said now bow your heads paragraph 29
[1:44:51] if you will it's a mental nervousness
[1:44:53] the woman asked this is a woman in a
[1:44:55] prayer line
[1:44:56] should i believe
[1:44:57] when i feel like i'm dying all the time
[1:45:01] this is this is what what the woman is
[1:45:03] saying
[1:45:04] should i believe
[1:45:05] when i feel like i'm dying all the time
[1:45:07] listen if you think i'm making fun of
[1:45:10] someone for feeling that way
[1:45:13] i'm not
[1:45:16] i know what it means and you do too
[1:45:18] to feel like you're dying sometime
[1:45:21] but she's asking brother graham and he
[1:45:23] said
[1:45:25] it's see
[1:45:26] you you must believe regardless of
[1:45:27] anything see you you never go to your
[1:45:30] feeling
[1:45:32] you go to your faith you could read this
[1:45:34] on your phone if you want to find it
[1:45:36] paragraph 29 of the authority of the
[1:45:38] word what did i call it i called it why
[1:45:42] that's the reason i look down at the
[1:45:44] next one
[1:45:45] this is the authority of the word to see
[1:45:46] if you have that
[1:45:48] you must believe
[1:45:50] you never go to your feeling
[1:45:52] you go to your faith
[1:45:54] he said there's where
[1:45:56] you're you're lacking of it sister i i
[1:45:58] want you to be well see
[1:46:01] but but
[1:46:02] it's a mental disturbance
[1:46:04] all the time
[1:46:07] i want you to hear me now
[1:46:10] he said you must just keep saying thank
[1:46:12] you lord for my healing
[1:46:15] thank you lord
[1:46:18] how you feeling wonderful
[1:46:24] thank god for my healing
[1:46:26] just keep on like that you'll get well
[1:46:29] he said see what i mean that's where you
[1:46:31] climb up over the rifles there it's a
[1:46:33] battle
[1:46:35] you've got to fight for you have victory
[1:46:37] you see
[1:46:39] he said lord bless this woman who i lay
[1:46:42] hands on and say to this evil spirit
[1:46:44] you're exposed god rebuke thee in the
[1:46:47] name of his son christ jesus may you
[1:46:49] leave the woman come out of her and may
[1:46:52] she go and be well in heaven grant this
[1:46:54] blessing god in heaven grant this
[1:46:56] blessing through christ jesus
[1:46:58] he said look raise up your feet now and
[1:47:00] say thank you lord raise up my hands and
[1:47:02] say thank you lord now i'm feeling fine
[1:47:05] see that's it all right go on off the
[1:47:07] platform walk on off yourself go on
[1:47:10] stand there let
[1:47:12] he said this
[1:47:14] sometimes evil spirits
[1:47:17] want to hold on
[1:47:21] it's left to the people's faith
[1:47:30] they have to leave
[1:47:33] in the presence
[1:47:36] do you hear what's going on in the
[1:47:37] prayer line
[1:47:39] that he he's just cast the enemy out
[1:47:43] leave this woman and torment her no
[1:47:45] longer
[1:47:46] and brother branham is now saying it
[1:47:49] matters how she goes down
[1:47:52] it matters how she goes away
[1:47:55] he said they have to leave in the
[1:47:57] presence that's true but when they get
[1:47:59] away they'll return you see if the
[1:48:01] patient
[1:48:02] can have enough faith to take it
[1:48:06] the thing away itself
[1:48:10] much the better
[1:48:12] all right
[1:48:14] now do you know what what brother brahm
[1:48:15] is telling us here
[1:48:17] he's saying i can cast the spirit that
[1:48:19] originates this kind of trouble i can
[1:48:21] cast that out she's got to go out now in
[1:48:23] the presence of the lord and this will
[1:48:25] be a whole lot more effective if she
[1:48:27] drives the thing out of her life
[1:48:30] you caught that didn't you see you you
[1:48:33] can't just depend on the preacher
[1:48:35] you're going to have a daily grind
[1:48:38] of keeping that paradigm ripped down
[1:48:41] keeping that thought process ripped down
[1:48:44] and submitted to the blood of jesus
[1:48:46] christ paragraph 82 of the message why
[1:48:49] he said now mean it in your heart
[1:48:51] just keep saying it over and over say if
[1:48:55] you don't believe it all together keep
[1:48:57] saying it until you believe it how many
[1:48:59] of you your mind struggles a little bit
[1:49:01] and you say well i can't lie it's no lie
[1:49:04] you're not telling a lie you're telling
[1:49:06] what the word said
[1:49:09] it's no lie to say what the word said
[1:49:12] it's right to say what the word said
[1:49:15] he said just keep saying it over i thank
[1:49:18] you lord for my healing because what is
[1:49:20] he christ
[1:49:21] is the high priest
[1:49:28] of our confession
[1:49:33] i wish we could put this one up
[1:49:36] i wish you could okay good thank you
[1:49:39] i'm sorry i didn't have the number
[1:49:42] i want you to find it go down to the
[1:49:44] highlights can you see the highlights
[1:49:45] down there at the bottom
[1:49:48] just above that it says hebrews 3 all
[1:49:50] right he's the high priest of our
[1:49:53] confession then he cannot do one thing
[1:49:56] for you he
[1:50:00] cannot do one thing for you
[1:50:04] can make no intercession
[1:50:07] until first you confess that it's done
[1:50:14] i know i've preached this before and
[1:50:15] some of you certainly know this but i'm
[1:50:17] wondering if some of you that have
[1:50:19] recently joined us if you've ever come
[1:50:21] across this or not because this can be
[1:50:23] life-changing
[1:50:26] his responsibility is to confess before
[1:50:28] the father every need that we have
[1:50:31] we have a great high priest who is
[1:50:33] touched with the feeling of our
[1:50:34] infirmities he is our great confessor
[1:50:36] brother branham calls him that he stands
[1:50:38] in intercession declaring our need in
[1:50:41] the presence of the spirit of eternal
[1:50:43] god
[1:50:44] but here brother branham tells us he
[1:50:46] cannot do one thing for you he can make
[1:50:49] no intercession until first you confess
[1:50:51] that it's done he said now is that
[1:50:53] scriptural
[1:50:55] he said hi
[1:50:56] priest of
[1:51:00] our confession then he can only act
[1:51:07] i'm not trying to push something over on
[1:51:09] you
[1:51:11] i want you to think on in a moment
[1:51:14] then he can only act when we do what
[1:51:18] now we confess all day long
[1:51:21] we're always saying something
[1:51:24] how many of you would would shudder in
[1:51:26] the thought
[1:51:28] that your confessor your intercessor is
[1:51:31] standing in the presence of the eternal
[1:51:32] spirit of god declaring what you're
[1:51:35] saying here on earth
[1:51:41] think about some of the things we say
[1:51:43] shall i give you a list
[1:51:47] somebody said no
[1:51:52] i just happen to have a list
[1:51:57] just a moment
[1:52:01] hallelujah
[1:52:04] what did i do with it
[1:52:06] it's here it's here it's here
[1:52:09] it's coming to you
[1:52:12] will i ever find where i was i don't
[1:52:14] know about that
[1:52:26] it's coming it's coming
[1:52:33] these are the ants
[1:52:37] these are some of the automatic negative
[1:52:39] thoughts just a moment i am really in a
[1:52:41] sweat
[1:52:48] we're in the battle
[1:52:52] let me say up front to every cell of my
[1:52:55] body
[1:52:57] i am not confessing this over my own
[1:53:00] life
[1:53:03] i'm giving you an example
[1:53:06] of some negative self-talk and automatic
[1:53:08] negative thoughts
[1:53:10] that people say if our
[1:53:12] intercessor if our confessor
[1:53:15] is standing in the presence of the
[1:53:16] eternal spirit of god saying in heaven
[1:53:19] what we say on earth
[1:53:22] can you imagine some of these things
[1:53:24] being said
[1:53:26] we better work on our confession
[1:53:29] is anybody following me
[1:53:32] i'm such an idiot
[1:53:35] i can't believe i'm so stupid
[1:53:38] you've never said that have you
[1:53:43] we've probably felt that way before
[1:53:46] but it's nothing to confess
[1:53:51] we're wasting our
[1:53:52] confessor when we say things like that
[1:53:55] we have the privilege
[1:53:56] of declaring things in the presence of
[1:53:59] the eternal spirit of god
[1:54:01] we've got one who has dedicated himself
[1:54:03] as an intercessor and as a confessor
[1:54:06] and he's only moving based on our
[1:54:08] confession
[1:54:12] so he certainly cannot confess these
[1:54:14] things
[1:54:15] in the presence of the father
[1:54:17] and this makes up a lot of what we say
[1:54:19] in the course of a day
[1:54:21] he's not only do we say i'm such an
[1:54:23] idiot i can't believe i'm so stupid he's
[1:54:25] such an idiot i can't believe he's so
[1:54:27] stupid
[1:54:28] i can't believe she's so stupid this is
[1:54:30] terrible this is horrible i can't stand
[1:54:33] this
[1:54:35] i should be able to handle this other
[1:54:37] people can
[1:54:39] he or she makes me so mad
[1:54:44] he or she is never there when i need him
[1:54:49] never there when i need her
[1:54:51] i can't believe this is happening to me
[1:54:54] my upbringing and my past prevent me
[1:54:57] from loving or trusting people
[1:55:00] things never go right for me
[1:55:04] some people confess i believe in
[1:55:06] murphy's law if anything can go wrong
[1:55:08] it'll go wrong for me
[1:55:11] you know why it's so quiet
[1:55:16] people can't change
[1:55:21] just a leopard can't change his spots
[1:55:24] people can't change
[1:55:26] i'm useless
[1:55:28] i'm no good
[1:55:30] i'm bad i'm a failure
[1:55:33] i'll never get another job
[1:55:39] i'm not a good mom i'm not a good dad
[1:55:42] even if you are don't ever say it
[1:55:45] even if you feel that way don't confess
[1:55:47] that
[1:55:48] i'm yielding to the best papa there's
[1:55:50] ever been i'm yielding my my will my
[1:55:52] ability my my my strength i'm yielding
[1:55:55] all of that to the one who knows how to
[1:55:57] make me the best daddy the best mama
[1:55:59] don't say i'm worthless
[1:56:01] don't people say everybody else is
[1:56:02] better than i am i could never do that
[1:56:04] i'm not a nice person i heard someone
[1:56:06] recently say not too far from me right
[1:56:08] now i could hit you between the eye with
[1:56:10] a songbook
[1:56:19] duck
[1:56:32] i've heard someone recently say i'm not
[1:56:34] a nice person
[1:56:38] now what kind of a confession is that
[1:56:41] i'll never be any good it's always my
[1:56:44] fault nobody likes me i'm not popular i
[1:56:47] can't cope
[1:56:50] why do things like this always happen to
[1:56:52] me this is the worst thing that could
[1:56:53] have ever happened
[1:56:57] i'll never be able to learn anything
[1:56:59] i'll never get better i'm not bright
[1:57:01] enough
[1:57:02] the worst always happens to me this
[1:57:04] won't work out i'm afraid to get excited
[1:57:06] because things never work out for me
[1:57:10] i never get things right
[1:57:13] the list goes on and on and on
[1:57:17] these are the kinds of things that we
[1:57:19] confess on a weekly basis
[1:57:23] we say things like this will never get
[1:57:25] any better
[1:57:27] my job situation will never get any
[1:57:29] better
[1:57:30] we say that and when we do the confessor
[1:57:33] is silent
[1:57:36] he can't speak those kinds of things in
[1:57:38] the presence of the eternal spirit of
[1:57:40] god
[1:57:41] what kind of heaven would it be if he
[1:57:43] was constantly confessing those things
[1:57:45] through eternity
[1:57:47] so he's confessing nothing before the
[1:57:49] father on your behalf
[1:57:52] you have the ability to begin to come
[1:57:54] into agreement with god's word
[1:57:57] somebody said i don't even know where to
[1:57:59] start you can start right here i am not
[1:58:02] what i ought to be i am not what i want
[1:58:04] to be but i am not what i used to be by
[1:58:07] the grace of god
[1:58:08] [Music]
[1:58:09] see that
[1:58:12] say that
[1:58:14] see i have every intention of growing in
[1:58:16] the grace and knowledge of jesus christ
[1:58:19] am an overcomer
[1:58:21] [Applause]
[1:58:24] who posted that list was that sister
[1:58:25] beverly reposted a list of confessions
[1:58:28] and affirmations on her facebook you
[1:58:30] ought to read them all
[1:58:33] i gave you a list one time
[1:58:36] of confirmations and affirmations that
[1:58:38] you can speak over your own life oh that
[1:58:39] sounds like new age oh that sounds like
[1:58:42] hocus pocus no it sounds like somewhere
[1:58:44] in the heavenlies there's an intercessor
[1:58:46] there's a confessor standing on your
[1:58:48] behalf
[1:58:51] nobody ever understands me
[1:58:54] i'm always so misunderstood you want to
[1:58:56] say that
[1:58:58] would you really want jesus to confess
[1:59:01] that before the throne
[1:59:03] is that something you want to fill the
[1:59:05] heavens with
[1:59:07] whoo
[1:59:09] so we are
[1:59:11] obligated to put the reins
[1:59:15] in his hands
[1:59:18] we cannot allow the enemy to drive us
[1:59:23] by old paradigms
[1:59:25] and thought processes
[1:59:28] we must confess the truth the word
[1:59:34] let me tell you something what i'm
[1:59:35] feeling here
[1:59:37] there are so many trust issues in this
[1:59:39] room
[1:59:43] there's so many trust issues
[1:59:45] husbands don't trust their wives wives
[1:59:48] don't trust their husbands how in the
[1:59:50] world can we build strong families
[1:59:57] you say but he's given me every reason
[1:59:58] not to trust him he probably has
[2:00:02] but you will remain in torment
[2:00:06] until you make up your mind that if you
[2:00:08] can have confidence in your husband to
[2:00:10] change
[2:00:11] you can have confidence in the one
[2:00:12] that's got a hold of him
[2:00:17] vice versa
[2:00:19] for a husband who has a wife
[2:00:22] who who is not
[2:00:23] cheater she's not been a cheater she's
[2:00:25] not lived that kind of a life
[2:00:27] and you know that she's not lived that
[2:00:29] kind of a life with you and yet there
[2:00:31] are so many trust issues that can come
[2:00:33] up in the heart of a husband toward his
[2:00:35] wife as though she has some kind of
[2:00:38] agenda that she wants to see you fail
[2:00:43] it's impossible if she loves the lord
[2:00:48] if she loves the lord and his word it is
[2:00:51] impossible for her to want you to fail
[2:00:56] but the enemy will tell you that and you
[2:00:58] will confess that
[2:01:03] there are husbands who have spoken to
[2:01:05] their wives you're out to get me
[2:01:10] if you believe such a thing like that
[2:01:13] you're going to have to get that to
[2:01:14] calvary as fast as you can
[2:01:18] or you're not going to have a marriage
[2:01:21] and you're going to raise a house full
[2:01:23] of warped children
[2:01:27] is that too rough
[2:01:29] because that kind of an atmosphere will
[2:01:32] twist the minds
[2:01:36] of those who live in that kind of an
[2:01:38] atmosphere
[2:01:40] whether they hear those words spoken or
[2:01:42] not home is to be a safe place
[2:01:46] everybody's got to feel safe
[2:01:49] when they get home
[2:01:52] it doesn't mean that spirits don't get a
[2:01:54] hold of people it doesn't mean that
[2:01:56] there are people that are driven by
[2:01:58] something they've not yet learned how to
[2:02:00] control
[2:02:01] but what it does mean is nothing is
[2:02:04] accomplished by making these kinds of
[2:02:06] confessions
[2:02:09] much can be accomplished if we get a
[2:02:11] hold of ourselves and begin to pull
[2:02:13] those paradigms down
[2:02:17] unfortunately for many of us paradigms
[2:02:20] have become strongholds
[2:02:23] and strongholds have become death
[2:02:25] structures
[2:02:27] and what we're really building is
[2:02:30] death the bible said we have the power
[2:02:34] of life and death and where is that
[2:02:37] power held
[2:02:41] you don't just start saying something
[2:02:42] out of your head it forms first as a
[2:02:45] thought
[2:02:47] so if you hold death and life in the
[2:02:50] tongue you hold death and life in your
[2:02:53] thought
[2:02:56] anybody with me
[2:02:58] i don't know why we i don't know why
[2:02:59] we're taking all this time brother
[2:03:01] shelley i don't know why we're going
[2:03:02] back over some of this i don't know why
[2:03:04] we need to aren't there mysteries we can
[2:03:06] talk about
[2:03:07] here's a mystery
[2:03:09] here's a mystery
[2:03:11] we're the bride of jesus christ and
[2:03:14] we're not winning the mind battle
[2:03:16] there's a mystery
[2:03:18] and it's one that we can win
[2:03:21] we can win this thing
[2:03:23] we are winning this thing
[2:03:26] by taking god at his word
[2:03:29] we're winning this thing
[2:03:31] all right let's go back here just a
[2:03:32] moment
[2:03:35] i'm using several different places so i
[2:03:38] i ask you to forgive me for
[2:03:40] for jumping
[2:03:43] remember we decide
[2:03:45] if temporary thoughts get to remain
[2:03:48] and become a part of who we are
[2:03:51] in the message the position of a
[2:03:53] believer in christ
[2:03:56] paragraph 25
[2:03:59] brother random says now i don't mean to
[2:04:00] be belittling them
[2:04:05] i respect that
[2:04:09] i don't know what that is
[2:04:11] maybe it'll catch up in a minute
[2:04:14] but they're supposed to be i think
[2:04:16] that's later down so just leave that up
[2:04:18] and we'll get to it i think maybe
[2:04:21] now i don't mean to be belittling them i
[2:04:23] respect that but they're supposed to be
[2:04:25] up here and here they are way down here
[2:04:30] but do you know what it is it's hope
[2:04:33] instead of faith
[2:04:35] faith does the job right now hope hopes
[2:04:38] for it
[2:04:40] but faith is the product
[2:04:43] interesting
[2:04:44] faith really does it see we have lots of
[2:04:47] hope
[2:04:48] but not much faith
[2:04:51] you see hope is nearly passive
[2:04:55] faith is never passive
[2:04:58] faith must be active
[2:05:01] we can hope and do nothing
[2:05:04] we can't have faith and do nothing
[2:05:06] do you understand the difference
[2:05:08] when we have faith we move on that faith
[2:05:11] we confess that faith
[2:05:13] we bring our mind and our body and our
[2:05:15] life into alignment with that faith
[2:05:19] we're not just sitting over here hoping
[2:05:20] that things will get better
[2:05:23] oh one day some glorious day things will
[2:05:25] get better no hope is not enough faith
[2:05:27] has to kick in
[2:05:29] you follow what the prophet is saying he
[2:05:31] says now faith really does it see we
[2:05:33] have lots of hope but not much faith so
[2:05:35] we want to change from hope today
[2:05:37] to positive faith
[2:05:40] and there's only one way we can get
[2:05:42] positive faith
[2:05:44] and there's only one way we can get
[2:05:46] positive faith
[2:05:47] and there's only one way we can get
[2:05:49] positive faith
[2:05:51] with me
[2:05:52] there's only one way we can get positive
[2:05:54] faith
[2:05:55] that's by what
[2:06:00] could we try that one more time
[2:06:02] that's by
[2:06:03] positive thinking of positive things
[2:06:07] there's plenty of negative things
[2:06:10] oh there's plenty of negative things to
[2:06:12] think on there's plenty of negative
[2:06:14] things to talk about
[2:06:15] how many of you know you can shift the
[2:06:16] atmosphere of your home by talking about
[2:06:18] something positive
[2:06:21] how many of you know you can shift the
[2:06:23] atmosphere of your home by talking about
[2:06:25] something negative
[2:06:28] who likes a positive atmosphere better
[2:06:29] than a negative amsterdam i do can't you
[2:06:31] trust god folks
[2:06:33] can't we trust god i'm sorry i'm wearing
[2:06:35] you out
[2:06:36] can't we trust god
[2:06:38] can't we trust him to believe that he's
[2:06:40] going to do what he said he was going to
[2:06:41] do
[2:06:42] in the message life
[2:06:45] paragraph 98 he said and that's what we
[2:06:48] are here for this morning
[2:06:50] is to move your mind
[2:06:53] and your thinking
[2:06:55] from the things of the world
[2:06:59] until the things of god
[2:07:07] which is eternally
[2:07:09] and that's what preaching is for
[2:07:13] now notice this this is interesting
[2:07:16] he uses a word here i've taught you this
[2:07:18] one before but he uses a word here
[2:07:20] that's kind of different
[2:07:22] he said that's what's preaching that's
[2:07:23] what preaching is for is to pervert
[2:07:27] the thinking
[2:07:29] to a higher and better
[2:07:32] and to the place where christ is
[2:07:35] until you become converted
[2:07:39] then your mind
[2:07:40] reaches for those things which are above
[2:07:43] now when i think of the word pervert
[2:07:46] i always think of the negative
[2:07:50] but did you know what the actual meaning
[2:07:51] of the word pervert is it means to alter
[2:07:54] something from its original source
[2:07:57] it can be to the negative
[2:07:59] it can be to the positive i don't
[2:08:01] suggest that we start using the word
[2:08:03] pervert in a positive way without
[2:08:06] explaining to everybody what we're doing
[2:08:07] in our vocabulary
[2:08:09] but i'm telling you that the actual
[2:08:11] meaning is to alter something from its
[2:08:13] original course or meaning or state
[2:08:16] and then the next definition is to a
[2:08:19] distortion or a corruption of an
[2:08:22] original thought
[2:08:24] so brother branham is using the word
[2:08:26] here perhaps it was not the best choice
[2:08:28] of words
[2:08:29] but it helps to get a point across
[2:08:32] he said that's what preaching is for to
[2:08:34] to pervert let's say to change the
[2:08:37] thinking
[2:08:38] to a higher and a better
[2:08:41] and to the place where christ is
[2:08:44] until you become converted
[2:08:46] then your mind reaches for those things
[2:08:49] which are above how many of you could
[2:08:51] use a change in your mind
[2:08:53] let me see you
[2:08:55] how many of you could use a change in
[2:08:57] your thoughts
[2:08:58] how many of you'd like to have some
[2:09:00] conversion going on in your mental
[2:09:02] ability that you could reach up and take
[2:09:04] a hold of something higher than the life
[2:09:06] you're living right now
[2:09:08] in a message the door inside the door
[2:09:12] in paragraph five brother branham says
[2:09:14] sometimes people are going wrong
[2:09:16] thinking they're doing right but it'll
[2:09:18] wind up wrong
[2:09:20] so always think right
[2:09:23] do right
[2:09:26] and guess what
[2:09:28] you'll come out right
[2:09:32] maybe you think brother branham is
[2:09:34] putting too much emphasis on the thought
[2:09:37] but i think he's bringing a balance to
[2:09:38] where we're living
[2:09:41] think right
[2:09:42] do right
[2:09:44] you'll come out right he said that's
[2:09:46] right now look at this quote
[2:09:48] he said do right
[2:09:50] that's your duty to god
[2:09:52] think right
[2:09:54] know that you've got to come out right
[2:09:57] and you will come out right to think
[2:09:59] right is your duty to yourself and your
[2:10:02] duty to mankind
[2:10:03] to do right
[2:10:05] is your duty to god
[2:10:07] and he goes on and explains this to us
[2:10:09] in many many different ways through the
[2:10:11] message
[2:10:12] in the message we would see jesus
[2:10:15] paragraph 59 i want to go all the way
[2:10:17] down to the bottom
[2:10:19] to a highlighted part that's it
[2:10:21] and i want to read and let our
[2:10:23] conversation be clean
[2:10:26] and pure
[2:10:28] our thoughts thinking the best things
[2:10:31] thinking
[2:10:34] god's thoughts staying upon
[2:10:37] god's program and away from the things
[2:10:40] of the world do you believe it makes a
[2:10:43] difference
[2:10:44] in the message god hiding himself in
[2:10:46] simplicity
[2:10:48] brother branham brings it to a prayer
[2:10:49] sort of like this
[2:10:51] he said lord jesus in the way of
[2:10:53] humility and the way of humbleness i
[2:10:56] offer you the congregation that's on
[2:10:57] their feet
[2:10:59] i offered them to you because they have
[2:11:02] stood in response to the call
[2:11:05] they're seeking deeper things they're
[2:11:07] seeking more life and hearing after
[2:11:10] hearing that the blood of jesus so
[2:11:12] thoroughly cleanses and there's no more
[2:11:15] nothing that the complete word of god
[2:11:18] rests within them that the very command
[2:11:21] of their own
[2:11:22] voice
[2:11:24] is creative power
[2:11:26] listen at his prayer
[2:11:30] the blood of jesus so thoroughly
[2:11:33] cleanses them
[2:11:35] that there's no more nothing
[2:11:37] that the complete word of god rests
[2:11:41] within them
[2:11:43] that the very
[2:11:46] command
[2:11:48] of their own voice
[2:11:50] is creative power
[2:11:52] because in them is the holy ghost
[2:11:56] wait a minute
[2:11:58] are you listening to what i'm telling
[2:11:59] you this morning
[2:12:01] if you're really hearing a statement
[2:12:03] like that somehow i wish we could have
[2:12:06] it for you somehow i have to believe
[2:12:09] that you're not hearing it
[2:12:11] because if you hear a statement like
[2:12:13] that surely your toes will say amen
[2:12:17] it's such a powerful thought here he
[2:12:21] said that the very command of their own
[2:12:24] voice is creative power
[2:12:27] because in them is the holy ghost and
[2:12:31] this holy ghost is a creator he makes
[2:12:34] things come to pass because he speaks
[2:12:38] the word and the word spoken becomes
[2:12:47] i want some of you to take out your
[2:12:49] smart phone
[2:12:50] and i want you to take a picture of that
[2:12:55] i'm wait on you
[2:13:03] if your phone came across with no way on
[2:13:05] the ark
[2:13:06] you probably won't get a very clear
[2:13:07] picture
[2:13:14] and this holy ghost
[2:13:17] is a creator
[2:13:19] he makes things come to pass
[2:13:22] because he speaks the word
[2:13:25] and the word spoken becomes what
[2:13:32] amen
[2:13:35] amen
[2:13:37] i want to say amen
[2:13:41] i want to go to the
[2:13:44] schemes and devices for just a moment
[2:13:46] and i want to show slide 31 i want to
[2:13:48] take a little more time even though i'm
[2:13:50] fighting hard
[2:14:06] many thoughts
[2:14:08] make up a paradigm
[2:14:11] can be a
[2:14:12] negative paradigm it can be also a
[2:14:14] positive paradigm
[2:14:17] which becomes something
[2:14:19] in our subconscious mind or
[2:14:21] non-conscious mind
[2:14:25] you can make up your mind that you're
[2:14:27] going to read a chapter or two from the
[2:14:29] scripture
[2:14:31] every morning before you
[2:14:34] get dressed for work
[2:14:36] and you can form a habit
[2:14:39] that can become a paradigm
[2:14:42] and you can do it so that it becomes
[2:14:44] automatic
[2:14:46] for the first days
[2:14:48] you'll have to think about oop
[2:14:52] but you can program that to become a
[2:14:54] part of who you are
[2:14:56] yes
[2:14:59] my grandfather programmed himself
[2:15:02] to
[2:15:03] have a fork full not a
[2:15:06] spoon a fork full of peanut butter
[2:15:11] after every meal
[2:15:14] someone told him that it would help him
[2:15:22] he made up his mind he said to my
[2:15:24] grandmother i'm gonna i'm going to eat
[2:15:26] a fork full
[2:15:28] of peanut butter
[2:15:30] after every meal
[2:15:32] for the rest of my life
[2:15:35] she said well okay whatever
[2:15:39] after the first day she said this is
[2:15:42] your jar
[2:15:47] it's got your initial on it
[2:15:50] don't put your fork
[2:15:52] that you've eaten your dinner with
[2:15:54] in the jar of peanut butter for me
[2:15:57] use your own
[2:16:02] we kids reminded him
[2:16:05] for the first week
[2:16:07] don't forget your peanut butter papa
[2:16:14] it became a part of who he was
[2:16:20] one of the last memories that i have of
[2:16:23] my grandfather years later
[2:16:26] the day that he had the aneurysm
[2:16:30] he'd been eating that
[2:16:32] for full of peanut butter for years now
[2:16:34] after every meal i sat at breakfast with
[2:16:37] him that morning
[2:16:39] he'd recently retired civil service at
[2:16:41] fort benning
[2:16:43] and he was going out because they were
[2:16:45] having a a ceremony and the general was
[2:16:48] going to be there and they were going to
[2:16:50] present
[2:16:51] certificates and and and congratulations
[2:16:55] to those who had retired from the base
[2:16:59] civil service
[2:17:01] and he was so proud of himself so
[2:17:04] excited that morning
[2:17:07] he put on a coat and a tie and
[2:17:10] we sat down and had breakfast together
[2:17:14] and i remember this just like it was
[2:17:16] yesterday he goes out the door and
[2:17:18] closes the door
[2:17:20] rushing to make sure he's not late and
[2:17:23] he forgets the peanut butter
[2:17:27] my grandmother goes and opens the door
[2:17:29] and she says to him ralph
[2:17:32] and as she opens the door he's standing
[2:17:35] there
[2:17:36] because as he's getting in his truck he
[2:17:39] remembers
[2:17:41] i've got to go back and have my fork
[2:17:43] full of peanut butter
[2:17:45] why are you even using that as such an
[2:17:47] example i'm telling you that even habits
[2:17:52] i don't know if that was a positive
[2:17:53] habit or not
[2:17:55] it certainly didn't give him long health
[2:17:59] but it was something that he made up his
[2:18:01] mind to do and he did
[2:18:04] and he didn't let anything even rushing
[2:18:06] out that morning he it struck him i've
[2:18:09] got to go back and you can do the very
[2:18:11] same thing
[2:18:13] you can absolutely form a positive
[2:18:18] paradigm
[2:18:19] so that when the enemy gives you
[2:18:21] something negative you so quickly turn
[2:18:24] that thing around
[2:18:26] and confess the opposite of it
[2:18:29] now we have made fun because we know
[2:18:31] some people that have gone a bit off the
[2:18:33] deep end with some things
[2:18:36] flash's lights and crystals and
[2:18:39] all kinds of different things you know
[2:18:41] people can get quite
[2:18:43] overboard
[2:18:45] but these people have this habit of when
[2:18:48] they recognize that they have said
[2:18:50] something negative
[2:18:52] they catch it and they say cancel that
[2:18:55] well we've laughed at him because it can
[2:18:57] be very very hard to carry on a
[2:18:59] conversation with somebody
[2:19:03] who's talking away 90 miles a minute and
[2:19:05] all of a sudden they salt and pepper the
[2:19:07] conversation but cancel that cancel that
[2:19:10] cancel that cancel that but you know
[2:19:11] what
[2:19:12] if that's what it takes
[2:19:16] for us to change our vocabulary
[2:19:19] and catch ourselves confessing something
[2:19:22] that is not according to the word of god
[2:19:25] we might ought to try it
[2:19:27] cancel that
[2:19:30] blood of jesus against that
[2:19:33] i refute that
[2:19:35] i renounce that
[2:19:37] i refuse
[2:19:39] that
[2:19:41] because a negative paradigm can become a
[2:19:43] stronghold
[2:19:45] and a stronghold the problem with the
[2:19:48] paradigm is it can influence other
[2:19:50] members of the family and the household
[2:19:54] but once it becomes a stronghold
[2:19:57] they become bound
[2:19:59] your family members your household
[2:20:02] sometimes your co-workers they become
[2:20:04] bound to something
[2:20:06] that is not of their own doing
[2:20:08] a stronghold
[2:20:10] can be raised up over a house
[2:20:13] over a family
[2:20:15] over a church
[2:20:18] we've been given authority
[2:20:21] over strongholds here's the definition
[2:20:24] any argument
[2:20:26] that sets itself up against the
[2:20:28] knowledge of god
[2:20:30] it can be a stronghold
[2:20:32] let's go on
[2:20:34] a stronghold
[2:20:37] the very word that's used in corinthians
[2:20:39] there is a castle
[2:20:41] a fortress
[2:20:43] or anything on which one relies
[2:20:48] it's derived from the greek word echo
[2:20:51] meaning
[2:20:52] to have possession
[2:20:54] of the mind
[2:20:56] and emotions
[2:20:58] remember we are told to tear down
[2:21:00] strongholds
[2:21:02] now what is a stronghold something that
[2:21:05] has taken possession
[2:21:07] of the mind
[2:21:09] and the emotions
[2:21:10] are you still with me
[2:21:12] now the holy ghost is not a stronghold
[2:21:16] the holy ghost is our control tower
[2:21:18] we need to follow the leadership of the
[2:21:20] spirit amen we don't need anything that
[2:21:22] is not of god possessing our mind and
[2:21:25] controlling our emotions
[2:21:27] hello
[2:21:31] now let's go on
[2:21:32] any place where we have allowed satan
[2:21:35] to reign
[2:21:37] can be considered a stronghold
[2:21:40] in our life
[2:21:42] like all other spiritual battles
[2:21:45] a stronghold is not pulled down
[2:21:49] through carnal methods
[2:21:51] a spiritual battle is always won how
[2:21:55] by the spirit
[2:21:57] in the spirit
[2:21:59] how many of you are following that
[2:22:02] now here is a stronghold i want to give
[2:22:04] you an example
[2:22:06] of a common stronghold it's found
[2:22:09] in
[2:22:10] slide 36 it's found in proverbs 13 12
[2:22:15] and it says hope
[2:22:18] deferred
[2:22:20] makes the heart
[2:22:23] sick
[2:22:28] you can be
[2:22:29] sickened
[2:22:31] in mind
[2:22:33] and body
[2:22:35] of disappointed hope
[2:22:41] you hoped something
[2:22:43] to be better
[2:22:45] and it's still not better
[2:22:48] hopelessness
[2:22:50] paralyzes
[2:22:52] many people
[2:22:54] in the bright church
[2:22:56] hopelessness
[2:22:58] hopelessness becomes a stronghold
[2:23:01] and causes us to say things like it'll
[2:23:04] never change
[2:23:07] it'll never be any better
[2:23:10] the family will never get out from under
[2:23:12] this curse
[2:23:16] the church will never grow
[2:23:21] hope deferred makes the heart sick
[2:23:26] the word sick is translated unstable
[2:23:30] the bible said a double-minded man is
[2:23:33] unstable
[2:23:35] did you know that makes the majority of
[2:23:38] us at times
[2:23:42] unstable
[2:23:46] do you know what it means to be
[2:23:48] double-minded
[2:23:50] it means to have in your mind thoughts
[2:23:54] of positive and negative
[2:23:57] and you alternate
[2:23:59] living off of one or the other
[2:24:02] you get a good touch from god is that
[2:24:04] too strong
[2:24:06] you get a good touch from god and you
[2:24:08] walk out of there living off the
[2:24:09] positive
[2:24:11] catch yourself watch yourself you do
[2:24:14] your mind i'm going to practice what i
[2:24:16] heard
[2:24:17] the next thing you know you have
[2:24:19] reverted back
[2:24:21] to your negative thought process
[2:24:23] and you are now speaking things contrary
[2:24:26] to god's word
[2:24:27] and blaming people around you
[2:24:31] making excuses for your condition by
[2:24:33] blaming it on someone else
[2:24:36] and then all of a sudden something good
[2:24:38] can come along and you shift back now
[2:24:41] let me tell you something we can't be
[2:24:44] trusted when we operate like that a
[2:24:46] double-minded man is unstable in all of
[2:24:49] his ways the bible said so no wonder
[2:24:52] we're full of full of trust issues
[2:24:55] it's because we have shown ourselves to
[2:24:58] be unstable
[2:24:59] because we fluctuate back and forth
[2:25:02] between the truth of god's word and our
[2:25:05] perceived reality
[2:25:07] god break out
[2:25:09] every stronghold
[2:25:12] that has offered us an alternative
[2:25:14] reality for what your word says
[2:25:18] my dad will never be better don't you
[2:25:21] believe a lie like that
[2:25:23] my children will never be free from the
[2:25:26] influence of their don't you ever
[2:25:27] believe a lie like that see
[2:25:30] the enemy will cause you as you wait on
[2:25:33] the promise as you wait on a change as
[2:25:35] you wait on things to get better in your
[2:25:38] life or in your circumstances the enemy
[2:25:41] will cause that hope deferred
[2:25:43] the word deferred slide 37 the word
[2:25:46] deferred here
[2:25:48] does not simply translate
[2:25:51] as delayed
[2:25:54] we get tired and weary of waiting on the
[2:25:56] promise has that ever happened to you
[2:26:00] hold up your hand
[2:26:01] well i don't want to identify oh go
[2:26:03] ahead and identify one more time
[2:26:06] to every one of us
[2:26:08] we're tired of waiting on the change
[2:26:11] we're tired of waiting on the promise at
[2:26:13] times
[2:26:15] this word deferred doesn't just mean
[2:26:17] when the promises are delayed
[2:26:19] it means when they have been seized
[2:26:22] or violently taken ahold of
[2:26:26] the enemy is after your hope
[2:26:28] if the enemy can steal your hope
[2:26:32] he can pervert your faith
[2:26:35] remember we're not just to have hope
[2:26:37] we're to have hope
[2:26:39] and we're to have faith
[2:26:41] faith will put the promise of god in
[2:26:42] action
[2:26:44] the enemy wants us to lose hope
[2:26:46] so that we will not exercise our faith
[2:26:49] you're going to quit using faith
[2:26:52] in a situation where you've lost hope
[2:26:54] i may not be preaching to you but i'm
[2:26:56] preaching to somebody right now
[2:26:59] we will quit exercising our faith
[2:27:02] in an area of our life where we have
[2:27:05] lost hope
[2:27:06] we have to remember that it's not just
[2:27:09] delay that has caused us to lose hope
[2:27:12] something
[2:27:14] has seized
[2:27:16] has violently taken a hold of our hope
[2:27:20] and we don't seem to be able to get up
[2:27:22] above it
[2:27:23] no matter how hard we try
[2:27:26] it has become a stronghold
[2:27:28] it has to be dealt with
[2:27:30] as a strong hold
[2:27:32] it requires more than an i'm sorry
[2:27:36] it requires an about face
[2:27:38] it requires 180 degree change
[2:27:42] it requires making a conscious decision
[2:27:45] that i am going to let the lord fill me
[2:27:47] again with hope
[2:27:50] and my hope is going to anoint my faith
[2:27:52] and my faith is going to put me into
[2:27:54] action and i'm going to take a hold of
[2:27:57] everything that god has ever promised me
[2:28:00] in my life i'm going to quit waiting on
[2:28:02] it to come
[2:28:03] [Music]
[2:28:04] and i'm going to run out to meet it
[2:28:12] well i sure wished i had a better job
[2:28:16] the proof of desire
[2:28:23] you say it's like the man who says i uh
[2:28:26] how many of you have ever said this i
[2:28:28] would oh
[2:28:30] would i ever love to play the piano
[2:28:34] how many have you ever said it
[2:28:37] you didn't mean it
[2:28:39] yes i did mean it no you didn't
[2:28:43] the proof of desire is proven
[2:28:46] desire is proven in the pursuit
[2:28:50] no what you meant was you'd like to wake
[2:28:51] up one morning
[2:28:53] able to play the piano like sister
[2:28:55] laurel
[2:28:59] it didn't happen to her
[2:29:02] well brother branham talked about that
[2:29:04] little girl that god gave to give i know
[2:29:06] people that god is given a gift but let
[2:29:08] me tell you
[2:29:09] that is a small percentage
[2:29:14] here's what i loved about sister anna
[2:29:16] and i hope she takes this in the right
[2:29:17] way
[2:29:19] the the look of her jaw when she hit the
[2:29:21] wrong note
[2:29:23] and you know what i celebrate that i
[2:29:25] celebrate that that's who i am i
[2:29:27] celebrate that
[2:29:29] because she could have said
[2:29:32] she could have said to austin i said
[2:29:33] austin would you go and ask sister and
[2:29:35] christina maybe she has a song i don't
[2:29:36] want to pressure her but just see maybe
[2:29:38] she has a song she could say this
[2:29:39] morning when she found out that it might
[2:29:41] not work that the musicians we wouldn't
[2:29:43] have time to run over it she could have
[2:29:44] said well i might hit a sour note
[2:29:52] i love you livy
[2:29:55] but i have to say to her sometime
[2:29:58] you can play
[2:30:02] you can play that
[2:30:04] you're waiting on someone to play that
[2:30:06] for you
[2:30:07] you sit down and play it
[2:30:09] you can sing the song you can play it
[2:30:12] what if i hit a sour note guess what you
[2:30:15] hit a sour note
[2:30:17] i would rather be you
[2:30:20] i would rather be you
[2:30:23] than someone who said oh i wish i could
[2:30:25] play the piano oh lord of mercy i would
[2:30:29] love to play the piano
[2:30:34] no you don't want to play the piano if
[2:30:36] you really wanted to pray play the piano
[2:30:40] you would prove it
[2:30:44] you'd get you a book at the goodwill
[2:30:49] why do you say it that way because i
[2:30:50] know people real good
[2:30:53] and people will say i can't afford to
[2:30:54] learn to play the piano
[2:30:58] go to goodwill
[2:31:01] find you a piano book
[2:31:02] oh
[2:31:04] don't dare spend a dollar just ask some
[2:31:06] of these people who wanted to play the
[2:31:08] piano
[2:31:10] who got piano books laying around they
[2:31:12] never opened just ask some of them can
[2:31:14] you borrow one of theirs they just
[2:31:16] bought
[2:31:17] and never picked up
[2:31:20] i'm not saying everybody should play the
[2:31:22] end of it don't just sit there and wait
[2:31:24] on the gift to
[2:31:26] you know gobsmack you upside the head
[2:31:31] when you are possessed with hope
[2:31:34] and when you have anointed faith
[2:31:37] you don't just wait on something to come
[2:31:40] and fall on you like ripe cherries from
[2:31:43] a tree
[2:31:45] if you really want something and you
[2:31:47] really believe something you run toward
[2:31:50] it
[2:31:51] you pursue it in some way
[2:31:53] [Music]
[2:31:55] someone recently told me i've always
[2:31:57] wanted to have a business have one
[2:32:02] have it
[2:32:04] don't let the enemy tell you you can't
[2:32:07] have it
[2:32:09] there was a prophetic word over this
[2:32:11] church
[2:32:13] that told us that god was going to give
[2:32:16] brothers businesses to prosper their
[2:32:19] families and to send forth the work of
[2:32:22] the lord
[2:32:24] claim that
[2:32:26] i'm one of them
[2:32:28] you can't necessarily go and quit your
[2:32:30] job and wait on that to happen
[2:32:33] but you can make up your mind if anybody
[2:32:36] can i can because i'm depending on the
[2:32:39] help of the lord
[2:32:41] once you know that god has something for
[2:32:43] you don't you let hopelessness be a
[2:32:46] stronghold in your life to keep you from
[2:32:49] pursuing it
[2:32:51] is anybody hearing what i'm saying
[2:32:54] he's after listen
[2:32:58] the enemy desires to seize our promises
[2:33:02] to seize our dreams
[2:33:04] to seize our breakthroughs
[2:33:06] do you believe that
[2:33:08] he's after them
[2:33:10] he comes to steal
[2:33:12] and to kill
[2:33:13] and to destroy
[2:33:15] if satan can steal
[2:33:17] if he can seize and steal your hope
[2:33:21] then he can establish a death structure
[2:33:25] over
[2:33:26] a person's life
[2:33:28] and i don't have time this morning
[2:33:30] to talk to you some about death
[2:33:32] structures but i will tell you this it
[2:33:35] becomes almost like a magnet of
[2:33:37] attraction
[2:33:39] for death
[2:33:41] and when i'm talking about death i'm not
[2:33:43] just talking about physical death
[2:33:45] i'm talking about all forms of death
[2:33:48] i'm talking about poor health
[2:33:51] i'm talking about poor mental health
[2:33:55] i'm talking about poor emotional
[2:33:58] health
[2:34:00] when a death structure is set up over
[2:34:03] your life and you don't recognize that
[2:34:05] it started as a paradigm of negative
[2:34:08] thoughts
[2:34:09] that the enemy has has anointed and
[2:34:12] magnified until it's become a stronghold
[2:34:15] over your life and the enemy is using
[2:34:18] that as a death structure to attract
[2:34:24] discouragement and defeat and
[2:34:27] hopelessness again
[2:34:30] all the things that go with it
[2:34:39] i'm going to just take a moment
[2:34:43] thank you
[2:35:01] we'll go there
[2:35:03] when we meet again
[2:35:06] i want you to understand a little bit of
[2:35:08] how
[2:35:10] that death structure
[2:35:13] can work in your life
[2:35:21] in what i gave you this morning
[2:35:26] charity
[2:35:34] in the greatest battle ever fought
[2:35:36] paragraph 91
[2:35:39] i want you to look at this with me we're
[2:35:41] nearly done
[2:35:43] it must be accepted in the mind
[2:35:47] you must make a conscious decision to
[2:35:50] accept the truth of god's word in your
[2:35:53] mind
[2:35:55] then it is believed with the heart
[2:35:58] that takes faith
[2:36:01] then
[2:36:02] the word of god
[2:36:04] becomes
[2:36:05] a
[2:36:06] reality then
[2:36:09] every senses
[2:36:11] of soul and body
[2:36:14] is just scoured out
[2:36:17] with the holy spirit
[2:36:20] then your sense of god
[2:36:23] your conscience of god
[2:36:26] everything that's godly
[2:36:29] flows through you
[2:36:32] there is a cleansing
[2:36:35] that begins to flow through you
[2:36:39] brother branham said there's not a doubt
[2:36:41] anywhere
[2:36:43] there's nothing
[2:36:45] can rise up
[2:36:47] let's go on
[2:36:49] there's nothing can come up in the
[2:36:51] memory and say well i remember miss
[2:36:53] jones tried to trust god and miss
[2:36:56] so-and-so miss doe tried to trust god
[2:36:59] for healing one time and she failed see
[2:37:03] has the enemy ever told you something
[2:37:04] like that
[2:37:06] you say i'd like to trust god with my
[2:37:08] body well
[2:37:10] you saw what happened to so-and-so
[2:37:14] brother branham said in paragraph 93 but
[2:37:16] if that channel has been cleared out and
[2:37:19] been purged and been filled on the
[2:37:21] inside with the holy spirit that don't
[2:37:24] even come in memory
[2:37:28] how many of you want that place
[2:37:31] when i when i read something to you that
[2:37:34] the prophet said and you recognize that
[2:37:37] that is not active in your life your
[2:37:39] faith should move you to say hey i want
[2:37:41] that
[2:37:43] my faith is telling me hey i want this
[2:37:45] right here so that so that i don't even
[2:37:47] think about what happened to miss jones
[2:37:50] it don't even it don't even come up in
[2:37:52] my memory of others that may have
[2:37:54] trusted the lord
[2:37:57] and it didn't turn out so good for them
[2:37:59] i want to get to a place where that
[2:38:01] doesn't even come in my memory he said
[2:38:03] no matter about miss jones and what she
[2:38:05] did let's go on
[2:38:08] he said if you and god together and
[2:38:11] nobody else but you too there you are
[2:38:18] there's your battle
[2:38:22] kill him at the beginning
[2:38:24] stop him dead in his
[2:38:26] track it ain't how long you can make the
[2:38:30] war linger
[2:38:37] it's stop it right now
[2:38:40] you've lied to me your last time
[2:38:43] i recognize who you are
[2:38:45] i recognize where that thought is coming
[2:38:47] from and this this battle this
[2:38:49] particular one
[2:38:53] it's ending
[2:38:54] now
[2:38:56] you're the only one that can make that
[2:38:58] decision
[2:39:01] i've had people say to me i'm afraid to
[2:39:03] get on fire for god because i see what
[2:39:05] happens to people they get on fire for
[2:39:07] god and then they just start sliding
[2:39:08] right back into i tell you what how
[2:39:11] about let's get to a place where those
[2:39:12] thoughts don't even come into our mind
[2:39:14] anymore and we just say i want to be so
[2:39:16] on fire for god till i don't know
[2:39:18] anybody around me i don't even know what
[2:39:20] they're doing
[2:39:21] i got my eyes on calvary and i've got
[2:39:24] filled with a holy ghost and i'm ready
[2:39:26] to take god at his word and slay some
[2:39:28] giants and whip some devils and
[2:39:32] it doesn't you're not here to try to
[2:39:34] drag the war out you're here to try to
[2:39:36] win the war and get it over with
[2:39:38] now in the in
[2:39:41] in the same message greatest battle ever
[2:39:43] fought paragraph 108
[2:39:46] it's 136.
[2:39:49] that's on the clock
[2:39:51] i'm going to take about 10 more minutes
[2:39:54] and we'll be done
[2:39:57] 108 what you got then
[2:40:00] you've got a solar system
[2:40:03] hallelujah it's god set the stars in
[2:40:06] order and said hang there till i call
[2:40:08] you
[2:40:10] they stay there
[2:40:12] nothing's going to move
[2:40:14] them
[2:40:17] nothing is going to move them they're
[2:40:20] going to hang right where god
[2:40:22] hung them
[2:40:24] are you with me
[2:40:26] they stay there when god can get a man
[2:40:29] in his hands
[2:40:32] till he can get senses
[2:40:35] conscious
[2:40:36] everything cleaned out until it stands
[2:40:39] with god behind it in the spirit there's
[2:40:43] not a devil in the world can poke a
[2:40:46] doubt in there
[2:40:48] how many of you want to be there
[2:40:52] how many of you want to be there
[2:40:54] the proof of the desire is in the
[2:40:56] pursuit
[2:40:59] i hope you'll have more of a pursuit for
[2:41:01] that than you do learning to play the
[2:41:02] piano
[2:41:04] i hope you'll say i'm going to that's
[2:41:07] going to be my life
[2:41:09] oh thank you brother shelly for reading
[2:41:12] to the whole church about
[2:41:14] me
[2:41:16] there's not a devil in the world can
[2:41:18] poke a doubt in there that's right he
[2:41:20] come around and say you don't feel any
[2:41:21] better
[2:41:22] your conscience has even gone to that
[2:41:24] the flu is so clear it shouts hallelujah
[2:41:30] the outlet blows a whistle glory to god
[2:41:34] it shines out certainly just as clean
[2:41:37] and clear for the word of god to work
[2:41:38] through the power of god he said see
[2:41:41] that's the main thing
[2:41:47] there's your battleground
[2:41:51] your battleground is back here at the
[2:41:53] beginning
[2:41:55] back here in the soul
[2:41:58] oh thank you brother branham
[2:42:07] he confirmed what we're trying to teach
[2:42:09] we get so ripped apart about
[2:42:12] by putting the soul in the middle like
[2:42:14] the scripture did
[2:42:16] but in this quote he's telling us where
[2:42:18] the battle comes
[2:42:21] back here in the soul
[2:42:23] mind
[2:42:25] will
[2:42:26] emotions
[2:42:29] he said the mind back here in the soul
[2:42:31] back in your mind that opens the mind is
[2:42:34] the gate to the soul
[2:42:36] and then corrects the gate to the spirit
[2:42:40] rather your mind opens up and accepts
[2:42:44] the spirit
[2:42:46] not your human spirit
[2:42:48] he's talking about holy spirit
[2:42:51] or it rejects
[2:42:53] the spirit
[2:42:54] now he goes on
[2:42:56] you can have little consciences and
[2:42:58] little feelings and little sensations
[2:43:01] all these things that has nothing to do
[2:43:03] with it
[2:43:05] that's just little sensations and things
[2:43:07] but when it comes to reality listen
[2:43:09] your mind opens it up
[2:43:12] your mind either accepts it or rejects
[2:43:14] it that's it friends god let none of
[2:43:17] them miss it your mind either accepts it
[2:43:21] or rejects it brother branham is serious
[2:43:24] enough about this that he praise god
[2:43:28] let none of them
[2:43:30] miss it
[2:43:32] see it's your mind that opens up the
[2:43:34] door or closes the door and listens to
[2:43:37] your conscience listens to your memory
[2:43:40] listens to your affections but when your
[2:43:42] mind closes itself to these things and
[2:43:45] let god the spirit of his word come in
[2:43:48] it blows the rest of the stuff out
[2:43:52] your mind can receive doubt your mind
[2:43:56] can move in faith it's a door
[2:44:00] it's a doorway
[2:44:02] every doubt is gone every fear is gone
[2:44:05] every sensation of doubt is gone every
[2:44:08] feeling is gone there's nothing standing
[2:44:10] there but the word of god and satan
[2:44:12] cannot battle against that
[2:44:15] if you and i will fortify our minds with
[2:44:18] the word of god satan can no longer
[2:44:21] hijack our mind to become his
[2:44:23] battleground
[2:44:25] i will say it again if you and i will
[2:44:27] fortify our minds with the word of god
[2:44:31] satan will no longer be able to hijack
[2:44:33] our mind and use it for his battlefield
[2:44:36] he can't battle against that no sir he
[2:44:38] can't battle against it now we know
[2:44:40] that's true
[2:44:42] one more paragraph
[2:44:44] he says these battles has raged since
[2:44:46] the day of the garden of eden the battle
[2:44:48] in the human mind satan started it what
[2:44:50] did he do when he met eve he didn't deny
[2:44:53] god's word
[2:44:55] but he did what
[2:44:57] he whitewashed it
[2:44:58] he adjusted it just a little bit like
[2:45:01] the church has done he stopped up some
[2:45:03] little channels here somewhere
[2:45:07] he said but surely god genesis 3 1. see
[2:45:10] surely god all these things that he
[2:45:11] promised he knew the word was right but
[2:45:13] he knowed he just couldn't he he
[2:45:15] couldn't just come right out and blast
[2:45:17] it out blast it like but he he did what
[2:45:20] he sugar coated it this is how the enemy
[2:45:23] operates
[2:45:26] this is how he operates
[2:45:29] you have a thought
[2:45:31] and along with that thought you have
[2:45:32] some kind of feeling and emotion that
[2:45:34] goes along with that thought that
[2:45:36] thought gets planted into your
[2:45:38] subconscious along with that feeling
[2:45:40] which causes your body to feel a certain
[2:45:42] way resulting in a certain behavior that
[2:45:44] is in alignment with whatever you choose
[2:45:47] for your thoughts
[2:45:48] we keep thinking these same thoughts and
[2:45:50] keep getting the same results we end up
[2:45:53] going around and around and around and
[2:45:55] around and around caught up in a
[2:45:57] paradigm held back by a stronghold
[2:46:00] operating in the death structure
[2:46:06] when the answer is rather simple
[2:46:11] we've got to think about
[2:46:14] what we're thinking about
[2:46:19] we've got to make sure
[2:46:21] that we are not allowing the enemy to
[2:46:23] hijack our minds
[2:46:28] we catch him in the act
[2:46:33] and begin to confess
[2:46:36] the truth of god's word which enables
[2:46:39] our confessor our intercessor
[2:46:42] to begin to confess in eternity listen
[2:46:46] when what you speak in time is confessed
[2:46:50] in eternity it brings a union
[2:46:54] no wonder it's creative
[2:46:56] no wonder it's creative because you're
[2:46:58] declaring on earth over here in time and
[2:47:01] the father it's being declared in
[2:47:03] eternity in the spirit
[2:47:06] your confessor is declaring that in
[2:47:09] eternity
[2:47:11] you are confessing that in time
[2:47:14] no wonder god moves
[2:47:17] to meet you at the place of your
[2:47:19] confession
[2:47:20] i want you to stand with me i want the
[2:47:22] musicians to come i know this has been a
[2:47:25] little tough i know it's been a little
[2:47:26] rough i know it's been a little long

[2:48:01] you when your mind goes off when it
[2:48:03] starts flying down that trail
[2:48:07] of negativity
[2:48:10] of doubt
[2:48:12] when you begin to make all those
[2:48:14] confessions over your body over your
[2:48:17] family over your situation that are
[2:48:19] contrary to what god's best has declared
[2:48:22] declared and decreed for you

[2:48:26] into accountability in that moment if
