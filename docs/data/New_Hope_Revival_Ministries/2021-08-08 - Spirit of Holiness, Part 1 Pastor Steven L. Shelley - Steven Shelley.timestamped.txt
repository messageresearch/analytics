[6:40] in just a moment
[6:41] but i wanted to greet you
[6:43] as we start our service today
[6:46] i wanted you to know
[6:48] that everything is going to be all right
[6:52] because jesus is still lord hallelujah
[6:56] nothing has knocked him off of his
[6:59] throne
[7:00] nothing has taken his authority from him
[7:03] not even coronavirus
[7:06] jesus is lord yeshua is lord of lords
[7:10] and king of kings
[7:12] you may be watching this today and
[7:15] you may feel really ill really sick
[7:19] your symptoms may be really weighing you
[7:22] down
[7:23] but i just want you to do the best you
[7:26] can to enter in with us today
[7:29] you didn't have to get dressed up most
[7:31] of you
[7:32] you could just stay in your pajamas
[7:35] we are just a handful one two three four
[7:39] five just six of us here
[7:41] uh
[7:42] only absolute necessary staff
[7:45] we are doing this because so many in the
[7:48] congregation
[7:50] uh are fighting that old virus
[7:53] and we didn't want to do anything else
[7:56] for it to be spread any further
[7:58] and yet i'm excited to be here today i
[8:01] mean that from the bottom of my heart i
[8:04] woke up wanting to be here
[8:06] and i want to try to encourage you
[8:09] i want you to know that it's going to be
[8:11] all right god is bringing you through
[8:14] just like he has brought the rest of us
[8:16] through
[8:18] if you are fighting the virus and you're
[8:20] at home
[8:21] i want to just say to you that there are
[8:24] good days and bad days in the process
[8:27] we came through this in october and we
[8:30] didn't talk a whole lot about it
[8:33] but god was so gracious
[8:35] and the fever would come and go
[8:37] sometimes you'd wake up feeling better
[8:39] than you did when you went to bed and
[8:41] sometimes it'd be vice versa
[8:44] and uh there are all kinds of symptoms
[8:46] that go along with it headache would
[8:48] come and go and
[8:49] some of you have already lost your smell
[8:52] and your taste but it'll come back in
[8:54] jesus name i believe it will
[8:57] and so if you are feeling better one day
[8:59] and not so good the next day don't be
[9:01] discouraged and think that
[9:03] you got to go through the whole thing
[9:04] again it's a process
[9:07] jesus is lord over every bit of it i
[9:09] don't know why you have to go through it
[9:11] i don't know why i had to walk through
[9:13] it but i know that we came through
[9:15] stronger in his name and i know you will
[9:18] as well and of course i'm speaking
[9:21] primarily to the new hope revival
[9:24] ministries people but i'm just speaking
[9:26] to whoever is watching this today live
[9:29] on the new hope app or facebook or
[9:33] youtube
[9:34] and if you're fighting another battle
[9:36] maybe you're
[9:38] not fighting the virus but you're
[9:39] fighting other battles maybe you're
[9:41] grieving because you've lost a loved one
[9:44] and you need the help of the lord well i

[12:41] and then we're going to enter into a
[12:43] season of worship
[12:45] i tell you i feel his wonderful presence
[12:48] around us right now
[12:50] and i'm asking him to do the same for
[12:52] you
[12:53] that you would
[12:54] focus
[12:56] that you would put your heart here with
[12:58] us
[12:59] and you would begin to meditate on the
[13:01] goodness of the lord even in the midst
[13:04] of your sickness
[13:07] your weariness your troubles and i'm
[13:09] believing that god will manifest his
[13:11] presence
[13:13] in your home in your automobile
[13:15] your place of work wherever you may be
[13:17] seeing this whether life or by archive
[13:21] i want you to experience
[13:24] that wonderful presence of the lord that
[13:27] comes
[13:28] in that moment that we focus on him
[13:32] we forget the best we can about
[13:34] everything else around us
[13:36] and we let our faith lift him up to his
[13:39] rightful position
[13:41] oh he is strong and mighty
[13:44] he is a god of battles
[13:46] he has everything in his great big
[13:48] capable hands today
[13:51] and we want to dedicate this time to him
[13:55] let's pray
[13:56] father
[13:58] we come to you in the mighty name
[14:01] of our lord and savior
[14:03] jesus christ
[14:06] we present our needs and we are
[14:09] not ashamed to say there are many
[14:12] there are many of our own church folks
[14:16] fighting the virus
[14:19] most of them with mild to moderate
[14:22] symptoms but nonetheless
[14:25] it's a battle
[14:27] and
[14:28] us not being able to gather together
[14:31] today
[14:33] is hard on some people more
[14:36] for some than others
[14:38] but there are people who depend
[14:41] on this corporate anointing
[14:44] and so lord i can only ask
[14:48] that by a supernatural power
[14:51] you would allow this sweet anointing
[14:54] that has come into this room today
[14:57] to be transferred
[14:59] through technology
[15:01] into any home
[15:03] that's making you lord right now
[15:05] that's focusing on you i pray for the
[15:08] sick and the afflicted in the name of
[15:10] the lord jesus christ
[15:13] we rebuke and resist the symptoms of
[15:17] this virus
[15:18] we ask you lord to let today be a
[15:22] turnaround
[15:24] no matter
[15:25] where someone is in the process of this
[15:28] virus
[15:30] let today
[15:31] be a turnaround
[15:33] and lord we want to acknowledge the

[40:44] gratitude and the thanksgiving
[40:47] that's in our hearts
[40:49] when we think of the goodness of jesus
[40:52] when we think of all that you have done

[41:20] his wonderful wonderful name
[41:23] [Music]
[41:25] what a joy
[41:27] it is to be able to worship the lord
[41:30] today
[41:31] in spirit and in truth
[41:34] and you would never know by what we feel
[41:38] you would never know
[41:39] that the building is empty today
[41:42] in fact i don't believe it is i believe
[41:44] what the word teaches us
[41:46] i believe that this room is filled with
[41:49] the angelic host of god
[41:52] they've come because we're lifting up
[41:54] and exalting the name of the lord who is
[41:58] worthy to be praised worthy to be
[42:01] praised
[42:02] i want us to go to the lord in prayer
[42:05] again in a moment and then i'm going to
[42:07] sing just a little bit of what a healing
[42:09] jesus and it's maybe in g but i'm not
[42:12] sure
[42:13] because no matter how you feel right now
[42:16] he hasn't lost his power
[42:19] to heal you
[42:20] or to deliver you from whatever has you
[42:24] in its grip
[42:25] i just want to say that god is with us
[42:28] today and
[42:29] we want his name to be praised
[42:32] i only have a little battery on the
[42:34] laptop here
[42:36] and we're in the process of moving
[42:38] things in and out of my office
[42:41] here at the church
[42:43] a little bit of not really a remodel but
[42:46] uh
[42:47] putting in a new desk and
[42:49] and so things are scattered and i don't
[42:51] know where my power cord is so i only
[42:53] have just a few minutes here
[42:55] to say hello
[42:57] to all of you who are streaming this
[42:59] service
[43:01] i'm not able to pull up right now all of
[43:04] your names on facebook but i see so many
[43:08] precious people
[43:10] and many of you are streaming on the app
[43:13] and if you don't have the app you can
[43:15] get the app just search for new hope
[43:17] revival ministries it's available in
[43:20] both platforms you can hold it then in
[43:23] the palm of your hand there's wonderful
[43:25] preaching there by brother branham and
[43:28] our services are also there we have some
[43:31] messages from brother perry green
[43:33] there's wonderful music on there that
[43:36] will also be a blessing and an
[43:37] encouragement to you and you can just
[43:40] have it right there on the app
[43:42] but many are watching by facebook and i
[43:45] just greet you all in the name of the
[43:47] lord from british columbia
[43:50] and from lagrange georgia about an hour
[43:53] up the road and over in columbus and
[43:56] uh sister marie i don't know where
[43:58] you're living these days but we greet
[44:01] you and remember the time that you were
[44:03] here with us
[44:04] all of my precious brothers from so many
[44:07] places brother
[44:08] tommy from ireland god bless you sir we
[44:11] salute you
[44:12] in the wonderful name of jesus
[44:15] i have
[44:16] also been getting texts
[44:19] and
[44:20] selfies of some of our congregation who
[44:24] just snapped a picture of themselves
[44:27] watching
[44:28] and they wanted me to know that the
[44:30] congregation is with me so i appreciate
[44:32] that so much we welcome virtual amends
[44:36] you can text them you can comment them
[44:38] on facebook or youtube
[44:40] and you say it doesn't make any
[44:41] difference it does make a difference
[44:44] in fact sometime when the enemy's
[44:46] beating us up during the week
[44:48] we just go back i i'm not ashamed to
[44:50] tell you i just go back and read the
[44:52] amens and i say to the enemy somebody
[44:55] was helped somebody got a touch somebody
[44:59] was encouraged and then in turn that
[45:01] encourages me so god bless you for that
[45:04] and we'll take more selfies of you
[45:06] watching the service today it just it
[45:09] does seem odd for the congregation not
[45:11] to be here but uh many families are
[45:14] gathered together
[45:16] and are worshiping the lord with us
[45:19] and uh i don't know the numbers you know
[45:22] i know they're they're fact driven
[45:24] people who need the numbers but i don't
[45:27] have the numbers i don't know exactly
[45:29] how many people in our congregation are
[45:31] fighting the virus but i want to say by
[45:34] the grace of god they're fighting it at
[45:36] home
[45:38] thus far not any of them are in the
[45:40] hospital and none of them seem to be in
[45:42] a life-threatening place this morning
[45:45] all to the glory of god i want to thank
[45:48] him for the way that he has ministered
[45:50] and moved especially to the elderly and
[45:53] those who may have some predisposition
[45:56] or already some uh
[45:59] you know different things in their body
[46:01] that make them a little more vulnerable
[46:02] maybe lung
[46:03] issues or blood pressure problems and
[46:06] god's just being so good and we want to
[46:08] give him praise we want to be mindful of
[46:11] others who are suffering who are in the
[46:14] hospital in other places some on life
[46:16] support and we just trust mighty king
[46:20] jesus
[46:21] he's able to deliver
[46:23] so
[46:24] we don't mind to say that we would like
[46:26] for you to pray and continue to pray for
[46:29] the families here who are touched
[46:32] uh in many cases one has had a test and
[46:36] the rest of the family fighting the same
[46:38] symptoms have not been tested but all
[46:40] quarantined at the same time hopefully
[46:43] to get all of this behind us
[46:46] the last time in the fall when some of
[46:49] these things begin to come
[46:50] it was such a stressful time such an
[46:53] unsure time
[46:55] and
[46:56] there was
[46:57] it was hard to come to peace
[46:59] it was hard to reach down and pull up
[47:01] any joy
[47:03] but i want you to know
[47:04] uh this week
[47:06] tomorrow will be a week ago
[47:09] that we realized there would be some
[47:11] spread among us
[47:12] one sister had probably already
[47:15] contracted it on her job
[47:18] and
[47:20] so
[47:20] last monday we realized there was going
[47:23] to be a spread because of the contact
[47:25] and from that moment until today
[47:28] i have had an unexplainable peace i i
[47:32] just want you to know
[47:34] that there has been a peace
[47:36] that has surrounded me now it's been a
[47:38] busy week
[47:39] and we've been we've been trying to
[47:41] reach out and stay in touch as much as
[47:43] possible with those who are fighting and
[47:46] that has certainly taken a lot of our
[47:48] time
[47:49] and our energy to do that but in all of
[47:51] that there's just been peace
[47:53] and the testimonies that have come back
[47:55] pastor god is with us he's helping us
[47:58] through things are a little better this
[48:01] evening than there were this morning all
[48:03] so positive
[48:05] and then this may be offensive to some
[48:07] please forgive me if it is but there's
[48:09] been a joy
[48:11] you know joy is not happiness you you
[48:14] can be happy but that's based on your
[48:17] circumstance usually but joy is
[48:20] something that for me it's god-given
[48:23] and the enemy hates it i mean he hates
[48:26] joy in the heart of the believer
[48:29] and somebody said well why do you think
[48:31] that is brother shelley well the
[48:32] scripture tells us because the joy of
[48:35] the lord is our strength and i have felt
[48:40] his joy this week
[48:43] deep down bubbling up a time or two just
[48:46] bubbling up knowing just i think it's
[48:50] the spirit of god just whispering to me
[48:52] i've got this
[48:53] i've got this
[48:55] everything will be all right
[48:58] the battle is hard
[48:59] if any of you other than our own
[49:02] congregation you've been through this
[49:04] you know the symptoms are hard
[49:07] and even those who have cases where they
[49:09] stay at home it's hard to get through it
[49:12] it's there's so much uncertainty about
[49:15] it and unknown about it but even in all
[49:17] of that god is leading his dear children
[49:21] along
[49:22] and i want to thank him for that and we
[49:24] do want to go to the lord in prayer and
[49:26] we want to ask for his special grace i
[49:29] know that many of you out there have
[49:31] needs and we want to lift those needs to
[49:34] you
[49:35] for you to the throne today
[49:38] we want to mention again that
[49:40] sister joyce greeley her mother passed
[49:43] away this week not from covid
[49:46] but she was battling for a long time
[49:49] and almost made it to her 90th birthday
[49:53] and what a testimony i streamed
[49:56] the memorial service for her yesterday

[1:00:38] we have been in a
[1:00:40] series
[1:00:42] that we have called the seven offices of
[1:00:45] the holy ghost
[1:00:48] i'm still not convinced
[1:00:50] that that is the best title
[1:00:53] it seems to me like
[1:00:55] these are ministries or
[1:00:58] administrations
[1:01:01] you say well you might could call them
[1:01:03] the workings of the holy ghost well
[1:01:05] there's so many more than seven of those
[1:01:10] the holy ghost is busy i'll tell you
[1:01:13] that
[1:01:14] the spirit of god is busy
[1:01:18] and he works in the life of the believer
[1:01:23] never sleeping
[1:01:24] but always there and always available
[1:01:29] in just a moment we're going to go to
[1:01:31] romans chapter 1
[1:01:33] and we're going to read verse 1 2 3 and
[1:01:37] 4
[1:01:38] so you can open your bible and get ready
[1:01:41] to read romans
[1:01:43] uh let me say
[1:01:45] i think i'll just do romans 1 verse 3
[1:01:49] and 4.
[1:01:50] romans 1 verse 3 and 4 i'll read it in
[1:01:54] the king james and then i will read
[1:01:56] those two verses in the amplified as
[1:01:58] well
[1:02:00] let me mention here that
[1:02:02] uh we don't have a lot of birthdays this
[1:02:05] week on the calendar i hope i'm not
[1:02:07] missing somebody's birthday but i saw
[1:02:10] that next saturday is sister anita
[1:02:13] curry's birthday and i want you to pray
[1:02:16] a special blessing over her as she works
[1:02:19] so hard beside her husband who is in a
[1:02:23] battle for his life but satan is
[1:02:26] defeated and jesus is the victory and so
[1:02:29] we want to
[1:02:30] lift her up to the lord
[1:02:32] as they lead a little congregation about
[1:02:35] an hour from here and we want to be an
[1:02:37] encouragement to them
[1:02:39] and uh as far as we know right now we
[1:02:42] will be
[1:02:43] stream only virtual this coming tuesday
[1:02:47] night and the following sunday
[1:02:50] and the following tuesday night as well
[1:02:53] you say well that's a long time it is
[1:02:55] it's a long time but we're going to do
[1:02:58] everything we can to follow the
[1:03:01] leadership of the lord
[1:03:03] and if that's changed if god gives us
[1:03:06] another instruction or leads us to know
[1:03:08] what to do differently we'll do it so
[1:03:11] you be flexible
[1:03:12] if you're part of this local
[1:03:14] congregation but as we know right now we
[1:03:17] will gather in person together again on
[1:03:21] sunday august the 22nd and we're looking
[1:03:24] forward to that just taking just taking
[1:03:27] two sundays uh for the virtual service
[1:03:30] but we just strongly encourage our local
[1:03:33] believers to participate in every one of
[1:03:36] these services so that you can remain
[1:03:38] encouraged and you can stay ready for
[1:03:41] whatever god has i don't know how to
[1:03:43] explain this
[1:03:46] i don't really know how to talk about
[1:03:48] what i have been feeling
[1:03:50] i've tried in the last couple days
[1:03:53] i've sent out a few texts
[1:03:55] to or to try to explain what i feel
[1:03:59] but i feel like that we are
[1:04:02] crossing through something
[1:04:04] passing through something right now a
[1:04:07] time of difficulty it's not the only one
[1:04:10] we've ever had as a body
[1:04:12] but it it just feels
[1:04:15] targeted
[1:04:17] and when i say that i mean it in the
[1:04:19] best of ways
[1:04:21] it feels like that we are getting
[1:04:24] something behind us
[1:04:26] now you know in the natural
[1:04:29] we know that so many having this virus
[1:04:33] will help us in the long run
[1:04:36] uh it will create a hurt immunity among
[1:04:39] us that will be good for the future
[1:04:42] we have to be careful we need to be wise
[1:04:45] i have been told that
[1:04:47] by by a medical doctor
[1:04:49] that this variant of the virus what
[1:04:52] they're calling delta
[1:04:54] is
[1:04:56] more contagious
[1:04:57] than the first go-around of the virus
[1:05:01] and that every person who has it is
[1:05:04] likely to infect at least nine people
[1:05:08] and even though the death rate is lower
[1:05:11] uh it seems to be more contagious and
[1:05:13] going around
[1:05:14] each person who has the virus with a
[1:05:18] healthy body before will create
[1:05:20] antibodies that will strengthen the the
[1:05:23] immunities and the systems of the body
[1:05:26] for the future so i know that in the
[1:05:28] natural
[1:05:29] us coming through it as a body of
[1:05:32] believers is a positive thing i i know
[1:05:35] there are many who have said if you have
[1:05:36] the holy ghost you won't get the virus
[1:05:38] well you've come way too late to tell me
[1:05:41] that because i was there when it
[1:05:44] happened and i guess i ought to know
[1:05:46] i know the day that god filled me with
[1:05:49] the baptism of the holy ghost and i know
[1:05:51] that he has kept me
[1:05:53] and when i made mistakes he pulled me up
[1:05:56] and has led me into truth and i want to
[1:05:59] thank the lord for the work of the holy
[1:06:01] ghost in my life so i don't believe that
[1:06:04] and somebody said well the bible said no
[1:06:07] plague shall come nigh thy dwelling well
[1:06:09] i want you to know that doesn't
[1:06:12] necessarily mean we won't be touched
[1:06:14] with the same kinds of things
[1:06:16] that the world is touched with
[1:06:18] but there is a grace in goshen
[1:06:21] there is a grace
[1:06:23] when we are in christ and he helps us to
[1:06:27] overcome
[1:06:28] maybe it's inch by inch
[1:06:31] but we are overcoming daily and jesus is
[1:06:35] the victor he is lord over every
[1:06:39] circumstance
[1:06:40] and so i know naturally it's a good
[1:06:42] thing to get this behind us
[1:06:45] but it's spiritual that i'm sensing
[1:06:48] that we are coming through something
[1:06:51] as a body nothing gives you compassion
[1:06:54] for one another like you experiencing
[1:06:57] something and someone else experiencing
[1:07:00] the same kind of hardship there is a
[1:07:02] camaraderie there is a there there is
[1:07:05] something that that we can relate to one
[1:07:07] another with
[1:07:09] what i'm trying to say as a pastor to my
[1:07:12] local group to those who are a part of
[1:07:14] this ministry it's that i know god is
[1:07:18] bringing us through this for a reason
[1:07:20] and there's a reason for this season
[1:07:24] and his grace is all sufficient
[1:07:28] i feel like in some way
[1:07:31] it is a red sea experience
[1:07:34] we are passing out of something
[1:07:37] through a narrow place
[1:07:40] and we are coming in to something on the
[1:07:43] other side
[1:07:44] that will be a larger place
[1:07:47] and we have so much to give god thanks
[1:07:51] and praise for as we emerge
[1:07:54] just
[1:07:55] i don't know a few days from now a week
[1:07:57] from now whatever it is as we emerge
[1:08:00] from this place may it be said about us
[1:08:03] that we come through with more of the
[1:08:05] victory
[1:08:07] that we come through it with more love
[1:08:09] one for another
[1:08:11] more compassion one for another may it
[1:08:15] be that god accomplishes something in us
[1:08:18] during this season
[1:08:20] that a season of goodness
[1:08:23] or a season of all favor would not have
[1:08:27] been able to accomplish
[1:08:29] you know so many uh say when the when
[1:08:32] the going gets
[1:08:34] rough the tough get going or how does
[1:08:36] that go when the when the going gets
[1:08:40] tough when the going gets rough
[1:08:43] it's it's a tendency for people to run
[1:08:45] in another direction
[1:08:47] uh but i want you to know something i'm
[1:08:50] claiming today that it will be for you
[1:08:54] a determination
[1:08:57] to let your roots go down deeper into
[1:09:01] god's holy truth
[1:09:03] and realizing that our only place of
[1:09:06] safety and hope is in the solid rock of
[1:09:10] ages
[1:09:11] in god's precious holy and revealed word
[1:09:17] we are surrounded by uncertainties
[1:09:20] our nation
[1:09:22] and our world is upside down but i want
[1:09:26] you to know you've got somebody in you
[1:09:28] today
[1:09:29] greater is he
[1:09:31] that is in you
[1:09:33] than he that is in the world
[1:09:36] and i am so thankful to know that i know
[1:09:40] that i know that i know in whom i have
[1:09:43] believed and i know that he is able
[1:09:47] to keep that which i have committed unto
[1:09:50] him against that day
[1:09:52] now we have been talking about those
[1:09:55] offices of the holy ghost
[1:09:57] and we talked about the spirit of life
[1:10:00] and we talked about the spirit of truth
[1:10:04] and we talked about the spirit of
[1:10:06] adoption
[1:10:07] today we're going to begin a study
[1:10:10] that will keep us
[1:10:12] busy for the next few services
[1:10:14] on the spirit of holiness
[1:10:18] so you that have not been with us in
[1:10:20] this study
[1:10:21] let me go ahead and give them to you
[1:10:25] again
[1:10:26] and
[1:10:27] you can write them down
[1:10:29] so that they can be a part of your
[1:10:33] prayer life
[1:10:35] i have made them a part of my prayer
[1:10:37] life lord fill me today
[1:10:39] with the spirit of life
[1:10:42] lord jesus thank you for the spirit of
[1:10:46] truth number two
[1:10:48] and let that truth continue to work in
[1:10:51] me
[1:10:52] and number three the spirit of adoption
[1:10:56] that's bringing us into a closer
[1:10:58] relationship with the father
[1:11:00] so that we may become his fully trusted
[1:11:04] sons
[1:11:06] and he might endue us
[1:11:08] with the power of the spoken word
[1:11:11] to decree and to declare a thing and
[1:11:15] then stand back and watch mighty god
[1:11:18] take care of it he's a creator and this
[1:11:22] spirit of adoption that we have been
[1:11:24] studying is working in us by the holy
[1:11:27] ghost to bring us into a deeper
[1:11:30] relationship and into a closer place of
[1:11:33] intimacy with the lord even in this
[1:11:37] wicked hour so today number four we're
[1:11:40] back to number four
[1:11:41] the spirit of holiness
[1:11:45] romans chapter 1
[1:11:48] and verse 3 and 4
[1:11:50] concerning his son jesus christ our lord
[1:11:56] which was made of the seed of david
[1:12:01] according to the flesh
[1:12:04] now we're talking about the natural body
[1:12:07] of our lord
[1:12:09] made
[1:12:10] after
[1:12:11] the son of david
[1:12:14] the seed of david
[1:12:17] according to the flesh
[1:12:19] and verse 4 and declared to be the son
[1:12:23] of god with power
[1:12:26] so in one way the son of david the seed
[1:12:29] of david in the flesh with a natural
[1:12:33] heritage
[1:12:34] but in the spirit much much more than
[1:12:38] just the seed or the son of david in the
[1:12:41] spirit declared to be the son of god
[1:12:44] with power
[1:12:46] and then here is the phrase
[1:12:49] according
[1:12:50] to the spirit of holiness let me read it
[1:12:54] again and declare to be the son of god
[1:12:57] with power
[1:12:59] according to the spirit of
[1:13:03] holiness
[1:13:05] spirit of life spirit of truth spirit of
[1:13:08] adoption spirit of
[1:13:11] holiness
[1:13:13] by
[1:13:14] the resurrection
[1:13:16] from the dead now i'm going to read it
[1:13:19] again because i chopped it up
[1:13:21] concerning his son jesus christ our lord
[1:13:24] which was made of the seed of david
[1:13:26] according to the flesh
[1:13:28] and declared to be the son of god with
[1:13:31] power
[1:13:32] according to the spirit of holiness by
[1:13:38] the resurrection of the dead thank you
[1:13:41] lord for the work of the holy ghost the
[1:13:44] spirit of holiness
[1:13:46] that has declared
[1:13:48] jesus to be more than a son of david in
[1:13:51] the flesh but also to be the son of god
[1:13:55] with power
[1:13:56] he has been identified as the son of god
[1:14:00] by the power of the holy ghost stay with
[1:14:03] me now because i want us to go somewhere
[1:14:06] in our study today
[1:14:08] now let me read this in the amplified
[1:14:10] you may not have it but perhaps they're
[1:14:13] going to be able to pull it up there
[1:14:16] and we will read it in the amplified if
[1:14:19] not then that's okay you you can uh
[1:14:23] follow along with me or you might pull
[1:14:25] it up on your smartphone or something
[1:14:28] the gospel
[1:14:29] regarding his son
[1:14:32] who as to the flesh
[1:14:35] his human
[1:14:37] nature
[1:14:38] was descended from david now don't miss
[1:14:42] that it's a good thing to think of
[1:14:45] his human nature
[1:14:48] after the flesh
[1:14:50] was descended from david verse 4
[1:14:53] and as to his divine nature
[1:14:56] according to the spirit of holiness
[1:15:00] was openly designated the son of god in
[1:15:05] power
[1:15:06] in a striking
[1:15:08] triumphant and miraculous manner it was
[1:15:13] all supernatural
[1:15:15] by his resurrection from the dead even
[1:15:19] jesus christ our lord
[1:15:22] the messiah the anointed one
[1:15:26] i think i could read that again
[1:15:28] verse 4 and as to his divine nature
[1:15:32] according to the spirit of holiness was
[1:15:34] openly designated the son of god in
[1:15:36] power in a striking triumphant and
[1:15:39] miraculous manner by his resurrection
[1:15:43] from the dead hallelujah even jesus
[1:15:47] christ our lord even jesus christ our
[1:15:51] lord the messiah the anointed one
[1:15:55] so it is by it is with power
[1:15:58] it is with power that jesus has been
[1:16:01] declared and demonstrated to us
[1:16:04] as the son of god it has been
[1:16:07] accomplished by one of the offices of
[1:16:10] the holy spirit of the holy ghost
[1:16:13] and the office or the ministry or the
[1:16:16] administration
[1:16:18] of the holy ghost that has revealed
[1:16:20] jesus to be the son of god by power is
[1:16:24] the spirit of holiness say that with me
[1:16:26] the spirit of holiness
[1:16:29] now this is a very important work
[1:16:34] a very important office that the holy
[1:16:37] ghost is keeping
[1:16:39] in our life
[1:16:41] we
[1:16:42] must
[1:16:43] experience
[1:16:44] a continual
[1:16:46] process of cleansing
[1:16:49] by the spirit of holiness that's working
[1:16:53] on the inside of the inside of the
[1:16:57] inside
[1:16:58] of who we are so many times when we hear
[1:17:02] the word holiness
[1:17:04] we get only an outward image in our mind
[1:17:10] and we see a particular dress code or a
[1:17:14] uniform that we have come
[1:17:17] to identify as holiness people but i
[1:17:22] want you to know
[1:17:23] it is that but so
[1:17:26] much
[1:17:27] more
[1:17:28] the spirit of holiness is not something
[1:17:32] that works on the believer from the
[1:17:35] outside in
[1:17:37] but the spirit of holiness works on the
[1:17:40] inside of the believer changing our
[1:17:44] heart
[1:17:45] and transforming us
[1:17:47] into a place of real
[1:17:51] relationship with jesus christ
[1:17:54] it is not religion that's going to cause
[1:17:58] us to draw closer to him it's
[1:18:00] relationship
[1:18:02] that's going to make a difference in
[1:18:04] this hour
[1:18:05] and it is god's will to operate in the
[1:18:10] individual's life by the spirit of
[1:18:13] holiness to bring us into a closer place
[1:18:18] you see we are moving from slavery to
[1:18:21] sonship we're moving from a place of
[1:18:24] bondage to a place of authority and we
[1:18:28] cannot do it without the word and the
[1:18:31] way the word works in our life is by the
[1:18:35] power of the holy ghost if we know
[1:18:39] about the word that the letter killeth
[1:18:42] but the spirit the breath of god is what
[1:18:46] makes the word even the letter of the
[1:18:49] word be quickened to life it's jesus
[1:18:54] christ the living word that is
[1:18:56] transforming his bride into his wife it
[1:19:01] is by jesus christ the living word that
[1:19:04] we move from a place of betrothal to a
[1:19:08] place of intimacy with him so that we
[1:19:12] become one there is a oneness that god
[1:19:16] desires to bring us through bring us
[1:19:20] into and one of the ways that this
[1:19:23] oneness is being worked in us is by the
[1:19:27] spirit of holiness so i want to thank
[1:19:30] god for that holiness is not about
[1:19:33] religion
[1:19:36] holiness is not just following a set of
[1:19:40] rules
[1:19:41] or restrictions
[1:19:43] it's so much more than that
[1:19:45] holiness is about relationship so we
[1:19:49] want you to understand that the holy
[1:19:51] ghost working in your life as a believer
[1:19:54] he will work by the spirit of holiness
[1:19:58] to bring you into a place where you're
[1:20:01] where your walkie walkie will meet and
[1:20:05] match your talkie-talkie do you
[1:20:07] understand
[1:20:08] you know we have we have lots to say
[1:20:12] but it's not what we say that's going to
[1:20:14] make a difference in the world we're
[1:20:15] living in now it's what we live it's
[1:20:18] what we display
[1:20:19] it's what we demonstrate
[1:20:22] and so
[1:20:23] what we do in our in our outward life
[1:20:26] is an overflow of what's going on
[1:20:29] in our inner life so don't you think for
[1:20:32] one minute that brother shelly is trying
[1:20:34] to say today that it doesn't matter how
[1:20:37] we present ourselves in the outward man
[1:20:40] it matters so much
[1:20:43] it matters even more now than it has
[1:20:46] ever mattered in the history of the
[1:20:48] world that we are distinguished as god's
[1:20:52] end-time bride by the way we conduct our
[1:20:55] business by the way we we live in
[1:20:58] society even by the way we dress by the
[1:21:02] way we conduct ourselves even in
[1:21:05] behavior where we go
[1:21:07] how we live what comes out of our mouth
[1:21:10] what kind of talk are you having these
[1:21:13] things matter
[1:21:14] modesty matters
[1:21:17] it matters in a world that has thrown
[1:21:20] morals out the window it is not the will
[1:21:23] of god for the bride of jesus christ to
[1:21:26] look like act like talk like dress like
[1:21:29] just the carnal
[1:21:31] the the secular person the the
[1:21:34] unregenerated sinner out there and it's
[1:21:37] not the will of god either for the bride
[1:21:39] of christ to conduct herself and to
[1:21:42] fashion herself like the churches of
[1:21:45] this world the denominational churches
[1:21:47] of this world who have forsaken all
[1:21:50] concept
[1:21:51] all concept of it mattering how you
[1:21:55] conduct yourself how you present
[1:21:57] yourself even how you dress yourself in
[1:22:01] a lewd and and vulgar way this goes on
[1:22:05] in the average church today but it's not
[1:22:07] happening among the bride of christ
[1:22:10] because she is being constantly dealt
[1:22:13] with
[1:22:14] ministered to pulled by the spirit of
[1:22:18] holiness that's working on the inside of
[1:22:22] her to bring her into the image and the
[1:22:26] character of the lord jesus christ are
[1:22:29] you with me so i know that when you hear
[1:22:32] holiness you may immediately think of
[1:22:34] the outward but i want you to begin to
[1:22:36] immediately think of the n word because
[1:22:39] what is on the inside is going to
[1:22:41] manifest itself on the outside the way
[1:22:44] you you allow the holy spirit to work in
[1:22:48] your heart it's going to testify by the
[1:22:51] way you present yourself in public we
[1:22:54] are
[1:22:55] we are of a different spirit we are i
[1:22:58] believe the bride of christ is called to
[1:23:01] an excellent spirit and i believe that
[1:23:03] she must present herself in the public
[1:23:08] with an excellent spirit on her she she
[1:23:11] is not presenting herself as the
[1:23:14] downtrodden and those who have no hope
[1:23:17] she is carrying herself as somebody who
[1:23:20] knows her god and as the book of daniel
[1:23:24] says those who know their god shall be
[1:23:27] what strong and they shall do what
[1:23:30] exploits in his mighty name and so when
[1:23:34] when the bride goes out into this world
[1:23:37] we're not going out with depression
[1:23:39] written all over us
[1:23:40] and uh hopelessness written all over us
[1:23:43] and our hair all hanging down in our
[1:23:46] face like we don't care how we look or
[1:23:48] how we present ourselves no we take some
[1:23:51] we take some effort to realize that we
[1:23:54] are ambassadors of the lord jesus christ
[1:23:58] and everything about us testifies of
[1:24:01] something now our focus in this hour
[1:24:05] must be on allowing the spirit of
[1:24:08] holiness to work in us the character of
[1:24:12] jesus christ and that is not an external
[1:24:16] work first it is an internal work first
[1:24:21] let the holy ghost
[1:24:23] and the spirit of holiness
[1:24:26] transform change our hearts
[1:24:29] change our minds and bring us into a
[1:24:33] better testimony a better reflection of
[1:24:36] who jesus is
[1:24:38] because holiness
[1:24:40] is about relationship
[1:24:42] it's not about rule keeping
[1:24:45] it's not about measurement
[1:24:47] all these things
[1:24:49] maybe church standards
[1:24:51] they may be the work of the holy ghost
[1:24:54] as he flows out of us
[1:24:56] to to maintain
[1:24:58] a testimony in a dark lost hopeless
[1:25:03] world
[1:25:04] but we must focus first on letting god
[1:25:08] shape our character and bring out
[1:25:11] integrity in the bride
[1:25:13] integrity in the hearts of the real
[1:25:16] believer getting out all dishonesty
[1:25:20] getting every bit of that out and the
[1:25:22] way that we sometimes spin the story
[1:25:26] that we tell because we have a motive in
[1:25:29] mind the holy ghost wants to work in us
[1:25:33] by the spirit of holiness to take out
[1:25:36] all the spin
[1:25:38] so that when we speak we let our yea be
[1:25:41] a and our nay be nay is anybody with me
[1:25:44] am i getting any virtual amens here yes
[1:25:48] i'm getting a few
[1:25:49] i'm getting some somebody is listening
[1:25:52] to me our yea
[1:25:54] ba our nay binay our language
[1:25:59] not be
[1:26:01] bitter and sweet all running together
[1:26:04] but may the trumpet give a distinction
[1:26:07] may the sound of the trumpet not be
[1:26:10] confusion then the troops they don't
[1:26:13] know whether to stand still whether to
[1:26:15] advance whether to retreat but if the
[1:26:18] wars trumpet gives a distinct sound
[1:26:22] and a distinct signal then the army will
[1:26:26] know what to do do we stand
[1:26:28] and hold the ground do we move forward
[1:26:32] into victory into battle or do we pull
[1:26:35] back just a little bit and take a moment
[1:26:37] to reflect on what we're really doing
[1:26:40] and what manner of people we are we need
[1:26:42] a very clear clarion call
[1:26:46] we need the holy ghost to help us in
[1:26:50] that manner and we need to make sure
[1:26:52] that there is consistency in our life in
[1:26:56] our behavior in our testimony on our job
[1:27:00] how we conduct ourselves without
[1:27:03] prejudice may god burn out of us
[1:27:07] by the spirit of holiness any kind of
[1:27:10] prejudice that we carry whether it's
[1:27:13] racial prejudice or prejudice against
[1:27:16] someone we don't like or someone's
[1:27:19] personality or behavior that we don't
[1:27:22] like and it skews us and causes us to be
[1:27:26] prejudiced toward that person and not
[1:27:28] really give them a fair chance to pull
[1:27:30] themselves up like you and i want the
[1:27:33] chance when we fail when we make a big
[1:27:36] old blunder we want there to be grace we
[1:27:39] want everybody to show us grace grace
[1:27:42] and then in turn brother sister we need
[1:27:44] to be willing to show that same kind of
[1:27:46] grace can i get an amen
[1:27:49] somebody hearing me now
[1:27:51] we want to in turn be able to minister
[1:27:54] that same kind of grace to others so
[1:27:57] holiness
[1:27:58] above all is about
[1:28:01] relationship our god and creator longed
[1:28:06] to have fellowship with his own created
[1:28:09] ones
[1:28:10] i want you to understand that we were
[1:28:13] not built like computers we were not
[1:28:16] built like robots without a will
[1:28:19] without choice without the power to
[1:28:23] decide how we wanted to to live our life
[1:28:27] when we speak of predestination
[1:28:30] we're not speaking of god forcing
[1:28:33] someone to serve him
[1:28:36] in a harsh manner and in a way
[1:28:40] that would
[1:28:41] really eliminate any free will or any
[1:28:45] choice that's involved this is not what
[1:28:48] we mean we mean by the scripture
[1:28:51] predestination
[1:28:53] is foreknowledge it's god seeing and
[1:28:57] knowing oh before the foundations of the
[1:29:01] world those who would who would actually
[1:29:04] use that choice
[1:29:06] that free will to choose him and when he
[1:29:10] saw in eternity that you and i would
[1:29:13] choose to serve him in that moment he
[1:29:16] gave us a destiny that is fixed for us
[1:29:21] one that he will watch over one that he
[1:29:23] will guard one that he will be jealous
[1:29:26] of one that he will get glory for his
[1:29:29] name in this is what i mean when you
[1:29:32] hear me mention
[1:29:34] predestination and it's so wonderful to
[1:29:37] know that we have been chosen by god and
[1:29:41] because of that
[1:29:42] we are here on the earth with a purpose
[1:29:45] and that is he was looking for a people
[1:29:49] that would become so much like him
[1:29:53] that there is no strain
[1:29:56] no stress
[1:29:58] no difference in their fellowship oh let
[1:30:02] me tell you something there are people
[1:30:05] that we are more comfortable with than
[1:30:07] others you can't deny it
[1:30:09] you can't deny it there are people that
[1:30:12] you are more comfortable with than other
[1:30:15] people there's something about their
[1:30:18] likes their dislikes there's something
[1:30:20] about the way they they demonstrate
[1:30:23] their personality maybe you like more
[1:30:26] quiet people maybe you like louder
[1:30:28] demonstrative people uh i i don't know
[1:30:32] exactly what to say maybe a certain kind
[1:30:34] of personality makes you nervous
[1:30:37] and so it's not that you don't love
[1:30:39] everybody
[1:30:40] i hope but it's that you have a tendency
[1:30:44] to fellowship with those who are
[1:30:47] of a different nature than the one that
[1:30:49] makes you nervous
[1:30:50] maybe someone a little more relaxed a
[1:30:53] little more chill like they say
[1:30:55] uh
[1:30:56] we have a tendency to gravitate toward
[1:30:59] people that we enjoy being with uh we
[1:31:03] don't always make the extra effort that
[1:31:06] we should
[1:31:07] to
[1:31:08] draw others in
[1:31:10] especially uh if if others uh are are
[1:31:14] disturbing us you know we have this
[1:31:17] tendency to to flock with those to click
[1:31:19] with those who uh really
[1:31:23] don't challenge us
[1:31:24] and that's not a positive thing that's a
[1:31:26] negative thing because sometimes we need
[1:31:30] a iron sharpening iron we do we need to
[1:31:33] be kind of bumped against one another
[1:31:35] sometime to help us grow up into the
[1:31:38] stature of the perfect man but god
[1:31:42] himself was looking to have real
[1:31:46] communion real fellowship real
[1:31:49] relationship
[1:31:50] with those who are of a like a likeness
[1:31:53] a oneness a like-mindedness
[1:31:56] of the god kind let's say it that way
[1:31:59] hoping that we won't cause any confusion
[1:32:02] of the god kind of the royal seed of
[1:32:05] abraham
[1:32:07] this is what god was looking for
[1:32:09] someone who would he could have real
[1:32:12] oneness
[1:32:14] real intimacy
[1:32:16] real friendship
[1:32:18] real fellowship with
[1:32:20] and uh this is one of the ministries of
[1:32:24] the holy ghost by the spirit of holiness
[1:32:27] is to shape us
[1:32:30] mold us
[1:32:31] into his image
[1:32:33] into his character so that we can so
[1:32:37] be one with him
[1:32:39] have real fellowship with him we cannot
[1:32:42] accomplish this without the holy ghost i
[1:32:45] want to say this again we cannot
[1:32:48] accomplish that kind of friendship that
[1:32:51] kind of fellowship that kind of
[1:32:53] relationship that kind of intimacy by
[1:32:56] simply willing it to be so wanting it to
[1:32:58] be so hoping it to be so it's only by
[1:33:02] yielding to the ministry of the holy
[1:33:04] ghost oh my
[1:33:07] what god we serve
[1:33:09] that he desired not to only be the god
[1:33:12] above us or the god to walk with us in
[1:33:14] jesus but he wanted to be a god that
[1:33:16] lived inside of us
[1:33:19] manifesting who god is in us
[1:33:23] so that we could have
[1:33:25] that oneness that adam enjoyed with god
[1:33:30] for a short season in the garden of eden
[1:33:33] but one that a bride
[1:33:36] is going to enjoy with him throughout
[1:33:40] all eternity did you hear what i'm
[1:33:43] saying today what adam enjoyed for a
[1:33:46] short spell you and i as his bride as we
[1:33:50] allow him to continue to transform us
[1:33:53] into his image we're going to spend an
[1:33:56] eternity in fellowship in relationship
[1:34:00] in oneness and intimacy with him and
[1:34:03] this is because the holy ghost is in us
[1:34:07] to transform us
[1:34:09] from revelation to revelation to
[1:34:11] revelation and each time we receive a
[1:34:14] revelation by the holy ghost we move up
[1:34:17] a little higher and we move up a little
[1:34:19] higher and we move up a little higher
[1:34:21] hallelujah so god didn't just leave us
[1:34:24] here and say hey you get you get to
[1:34:25] eternity the best way you can
[1:34:27] no
[1:34:28] he came into us by the spirit he came
[1:34:31] into us by the holy ghost baptism so
[1:34:34] that he could daily
[1:34:36] you can't get rid of him
[1:34:38] he's there to see all to know all and to
[1:34:42] work all he wants to work on every part
[1:34:44] of us
[1:34:44] you see our god and creator long to have
[1:34:48] fellowship with his own created ones
[1:34:51] as our relationship grows listen
[1:34:55] as our relationship grows with the
[1:34:57] father into maturity
[1:35:00] by the spirit of adoption that's what we
[1:35:03] were talking about it brings us into a
[1:35:06] revelation and into a realization of his
[1:35:11] holiness
[1:35:13] i'm going to read it again
[1:35:15] i only wrote that this morning i only
[1:35:17] added that to my notes this morning and
[1:35:19] it felt like some honey was dropping
[1:35:21] down when i wrote it as our relationship
[1:35:24] grows with the father
[1:35:26] into maturity
[1:35:28] by the spirit of adoption it brings us
[1:35:32] into a revelation
[1:35:34] and a realization
[1:35:36] of his holiness
[1:35:39] the bride of jesus christ must be filled
[1:35:43] with the awe of god
[1:35:46] someone recently said it might have been
[1:35:48] brother hawk or brother greeley i'm not
[1:35:50] sure who said it recently here but
[1:35:52] someone was referring to the ah baby
[1:35:55] brother greeley last sunday the awe and
[1:35:58] the reverential fear of god the fear of
[1:36:01] the lord is the beginning of wisdom i
[1:36:04] want you to know it's the beginning of
[1:36:06] prosperity when we enter into the fear
[1:36:09] of the lord
[1:36:10] but we have a false idea sometime about
[1:36:13] the fear of the lord you're not running
[1:36:15] around like a little hamster in an
[1:36:17] experiment afraid that at any time
[1:36:21] the great a scientist or our god is
[1:36:25] going to take you in his hand and
[1:36:27] squeeze the life out of you or stand
[1:36:30] over you with a hammer and he's going to
[1:36:32] smash you when you drop when you fail
[1:36:35] when you miss the turn in the maze or
[1:36:37] you don't run in the wheel let me tell
[1:36:40] you something that's not the god we
[1:36:42] serve that's not the relationship we
[1:36:44] have with him we are not afraid of god
[1:36:47] because he has the power to snuff out
[1:36:50] our life at any moment but he does
[1:36:52] he does have the power he holds our life
[1:36:56] in his hands but that is not the healthy
[1:36:58] fear of the lord the reverential fear in
[1:37:01] all of the lord that's fear like we've
[1:37:03] known it in life that's fear like we've
[1:37:05] known it and i'll tell you the enemy is
[1:37:08] the author of that kind of fear but the
[1:37:11] fear of the lord is a reverential fear
[1:37:15] once you have seen
[1:37:17] the holiness of god revealed
[1:37:20] and and i don't even know as a believer
[1:37:22] if i have seen the fullness
[1:37:24] i i think i probably have not because i
[1:37:27] know there's so much more in me that
[1:37:30] needs to be changed but every time i
[1:37:32] catch a glimpse of the holiness of god
[1:37:36] so holy
[1:37:38] so unlike humanity
[1:37:41] so above
[1:37:43] the very uh temptation of sin
[1:37:46] so holy that everything he thinks is
[1:37:49] holy and everything he does is holy and
[1:37:53] everything about him cries holy when you
[1:37:57] see him when you behold his works
[1:38:00] i mean even in the natural you can stand
[1:38:03] on a mountain and look out over the uh
[1:38:05] the grandeur the splendor of god's
[1:38:08] creation and it can fill you with an awe
[1:38:12] it can fill you with a reverential fear
[1:38:15] that says
[1:38:16] oh my god is an awesome god my god is a
[1:38:20] holy god a powerful god a glory none
[1:38:24] like him no other like him i tell you
[1:38:28] you can just really
[1:38:30] maybe god has moved in your life you've
[1:38:33] you've seen a miracle
[1:38:35] i realize that some people don't feel
[1:38:37] like they've ever seen a miracle
[1:38:39] but i'll tell you the greatest miracle
[1:38:41] that you will ever
[1:38:43] see in your life is the transformation
[1:38:46] of of someone gripped by the spirit of
[1:38:50] death gripped by the power of sin and
[1:38:53] the power of god reached down and touch
[1:38:57] them and the spirit of conviction draw
[1:39:01] them to repentance and god break every
[1:39:04] fetter and every shackle and every chain
[1:39:07] and every habit and every bondage of
[1:39:09] their life and recreate them into a
[1:39:12] display of his freedom and his glory you
[1:39:16] can stand back and say brother that's a
[1:39:17] miracle
[1:39:18] when you see a hardened drug addict or
[1:39:21] an alcoholic or a sex addict or someone
[1:39:25] so in the vice grip of sin and unbelief
[1:39:29] gloriously saved
[1:39:31] baptized in the name of jesus filled
[1:39:34] with the holy ghost and then you say who
[1:39:38] who is this
[1:39:39] all things have passed away behold all
[1:39:43] things have become new you see before
[1:39:46] your eyes a new creation a new creature
[1:39:49] and you say who are you i don't even
[1:39:51] know you i can't even imagine
[1:39:54] one once uh maybe in your life maybe you
[1:39:57] have met someone who will testify to you
[1:40:01] of who they were bc before christ what
[1:40:04] their life looked like and what their
[1:40:06] habits were and what they enjoyed and
[1:40:09] you look at him he said ah i can't see
[1:40:11] it i can't even imagine it my
[1:40:13] imagination won't even go there to to
[1:40:16] cause me to even begin to think of you
[1:40:19] in that condition you've seen a miracle
[1:40:21] when that happens you can say thank you
[1:40:23] jesus you've seen a miracle i'm telling
[1:40:26] you there's power in jesus there's power
[1:40:30] in his blood there's power by the holy
[1:40:33] ghost to transform the hardened sinner
[1:40:36] the hard cases those who don't even know
[1:40:39] today they need a savior but the finger
[1:40:42] of god touches their life and they are
[1:40:44] awakened to the reality that they're
[1:40:47] hopeless without him i'm telling you
[1:40:49] that's a miracle but if you say i've
[1:40:51] never i've never really seen a miracle i
[1:40:53] i don't i can't really say that i have
[1:40:55] so i don't really know what's possible i
[1:40:57] want you to know everything is possible
[1:41:00] to him that believeth if you can put
[1:41:02] your faith and hope and trust in the
[1:41:03] lord jesus christ he can do above and
[1:41:06] beyond what you can even imagine in your
[1:41:09] wildest dream in your wildest
[1:41:12] imagination he's a supernatural god and
[1:41:15] that great supernatural god that created
[1:41:18] the whole world in the whole universe
[1:41:19] we're just one little part of god's
[1:41:21] creation here on planet earth he created
[1:41:24] a whole universe out there there are
[1:41:28] milky ways after milky ways
[1:41:31] there are planets that we don't even
[1:41:33] know exist
[1:41:34] there there is a handiwork in the
[1:41:37] eternities in the universe that we don't
[1:41:40] even get a hold of in our little finite
[1:41:42] mind we can't we can't really understand
[1:41:46] how how wonderful how how splendor he's
[1:41:50] so full of splendor and glory and we
[1:41:52] have a hard time
[1:41:54] imagining because we don't know it all
[1:41:56] and we can't see it all one day we will
[1:41:59] but i want you to know he is everything
[1:42:01] that we can get a hold of and so much
[1:42:04] more
[1:42:05] if you can catch a glimpse of that it
[1:42:07] will fill you with such an awe
[1:42:10] and such a reverence
[1:42:12] i'll tell you what else it'll fill you
[1:42:13] with it'll fill you with such a thanks a
[1:42:16] thanksgiving a thankfulness and a
[1:42:18] gratitude that a god that big a god that
[1:42:21] powerful a god that magnificent and
[1:42:24] majestic would choose you
[1:42:26] he would choose me and he would care
[1:42:29] about my uh runny nose he would care
[1:42:34] about my headache he would care about
[1:42:37] what's going on in my life
[1:42:39] you know it it'll baffle you it'll cause
[1:42:42] you once you catch a glimpse of really
[1:42:45] how holy he is
[1:42:48] of his holiness
[1:42:50] of his glory
[1:42:51] you just shrink
[1:42:53] you you do you just shrink you just feel
[1:42:56] like
[1:42:58] a little part whoo
[1:43:00] a little part i want you to know you're
[1:43:01] an important part
[1:43:03] but when we see
[1:43:04] the fullness we we recognize i'm just a
[1:43:07] tiny part i'm just a small part and it
[1:43:09] fills us with with a fear of god that is
[1:43:12] healthy it's a reverential fear it's
[1:43:15] it's a fear that brings conviction
[1:43:18] and this is one of the works of the
[1:43:20] spirit of holiness in our life he comes
[1:43:23] to reveal to us the holiness of god let
[1:43:27] me say that again one of the works of
[1:43:29] the holy ghost in our life is the spirit
[1:43:32] of holiness and the spirit of holiness
[1:43:36] comes to reveal to us the holiness of
[1:43:39] god because holiness is about a
[1:43:42] relationship praise the lord it's about
[1:43:46] a relationship our god and creator long
[1:43:50] to have fellowship with his own created
[1:43:53] ones
[1:43:55] as our relationship as our relationship
[1:43:59] grows with the father
[1:44:01] into maturity by the spirit of adoption
[1:44:05] it brings us into a revelation and a
[1:44:07] realization of his holiness true
[1:44:12] holiness
[1:44:13] hear me today true holiness is a result
[1:44:16] of the holy spirit changing our hearts
[1:44:20] and our minds
[1:44:22] until
[1:44:23] living holy holy living becomes an
[1:44:27] automatic part of who we are
[1:44:31] the awe of god the reverential fear of
[1:44:34] god a glimpse of the holiness of god
[1:44:37] will begin to dictate to us the way we
[1:44:40] live our life it'll take the desire to
[1:44:43] cheat out of us it will it'll take the
[1:44:46] desire to expose the nakedness of our
[1:44:49] body out there in the world it'll take
[1:44:51] that desire right out of you brother
[1:44:53] sister
[1:44:54] it'll start working on the habit that's
[1:44:57] binding you and holding you in its
[1:44:59] clutches the spirit of holiness will
[1:45:02] begin to teach you how to walk and how
[1:45:05] to talk and how to conduct yourself you
[1:45:07] know i tell you it takes the holy ghost
[1:45:10] to keep the bride church out of the
[1:45:12] pools and the fads and the fashions and
[1:45:15] the trends
[1:45:17] you know people today including the
[1:45:20] church are living by what's trending
[1:45:23] they're more interested in what's
[1:45:25] trending than they are what god's word
[1:45:27] has said you don't have to say amen i'm
[1:45:29] saying it for you amen
[1:45:32] we are more under the influence of
[1:45:36] social media influencers
[1:45:39] than we are under the influence of the
[1:45:42] spirit of holiness
[1:45:44] that has filled our lives i'm telling
[1:45:46] you church i'm telling you bride that
[1:45:48] ought not to be so
[1:45:50] we should be more concerned about
[1:45:53] allowing the spirit of holiness to
[1:45:55] influence us in the way we worship in
[1:45:58] the way we work with one another in the
[1:46:00] way we come together in the way we live
[1:46:03] our lives when nobody's looking this
[1:46:05] spirit of holiness by the power of the
[1:46:07] holy ghost should be the biggest
[1:46:09] influencer in our life why
[1:46:12] because the holy ghost will never lead
[1:46:14] you off the word
[1:46:16] the spirit of holiness will never take
[1:46:19] you off the word it will always bring
[1:46:23] you back to the absolute
[1:46:26] of god's word are you with me
[1:46:29] praise god i believe it i'm just going
[1:46:31] to take a few more minutes here
[1:46:33] and
[1:46:34] and then we're going to close we're not
[1:46:36] going to go on like we would if you all
[1:46:38] were gathered here but i hope you're
[1:46:39] hearing something that you can meditate
[1:46:41] on this week
[1:46:44] true holiness i'm gonna read it again
[1:46:46] true holiness is a result of the holy
[1:46:48] spirit changing
[1:46:50] our hearts and our minds you know that's
[1:46:52] intricately linked together
[1:46:54] our hearts and our minds until holy
[1:46:57] living or living holy becomes a way of
[1:46:59] life to us
[1:47:01] it's not a strain anymore
[1:47:03] it's not bearing a yoke of legalism
[1:47:06] anymore come on
[1:47:08] it's not fear of the church anymore
[1:47:11] fear of the pastor anymore it's fear of
[1:47:14] god
[1:47:15] it's the fear of god's holiness it's the
[1:47:18] awe
[1:47:19] and reverence of who he is that makes us
[1:47:22] want to do things that please him it
[1:47:25] makes us want to change our ways and our
[1:47:27] life so that we're doing things that
[1:47:30] please him and we are stepping away from
[1:47:33] things that hurt him or displease him or
[1:47:36] dishonor him brother sister this is
[1:47:38] relationship this is relationship when
[1:47:42] you know that your companion doesn't
[1:47:44] like something
[1:47:45] and is really uh against a certain thing
[1:47:49] or or
[1:47:50] or has a pet peeve that they just can't
[1:47:54] hardly tolerate it looks to me like that
[1:47:57] you and i would make the extra effort
[1:48:00] if it's something we can easily change
[1:48:02] it looks like we would want to make the
[1:48:04] extra effort to please the one that
[1:48:06] we've given our heart to the one we love
[1:48:08] so much and it's that way in our
[1:48:10] relationship with him
[1:48:12] we love him
[1:48:14] because he first loved us
[1:48:16] it's hard for us to comprehend his love
[1:48:19] toward us
[1:48:20] i'm telling you because many of us
[1:48:22] struggle with loving ourselves and being
[1:48:25] able to to to see that god has built us
[1:48:30] and that we are not junk because we
[1:48:32] belong to him many of us because of the
[1:48:35] scars of our past spend more time trying
[1:48:39] to disqualify ourselves from belonging
[1:48:42] to him into being his chosen we spend
[1:48:45] more of our time trying to take
[1:48:46] ourselves out of the promises of god
[1:48:49] than we do using our faith to pull
[1:48:51] ourselves into the promises of god you
[1:48:54] know if you do that you're going to be
[1:48:56] in that constant grind and that constant
[1:48:59] struggle of never being able to please
[1:49:02] god but i want you to know you can break
[1:49:04] free of that today if you've received
[1:49:06] the baptism of the holy ghost you have
[1:49:09] the spirit of holiness on board he is
[1:49:12] already present in your life
[1:49:15] waiting for you to yield more
[1:49:18] waiting for you to allow him to talk to
[1:49:20] you
[1:49:21] to to uh
[1:49:23] you know he will push us in the right
[1:49:26] direction
[1:49:27] nudge us
[1:49:29] he will
[1:49:30] put his finger on it and convict us when
[1:49:33] we start going down a thought process
[1:49:36] that takes us away from the reality and
[1:49:39] truth of god's word that little little
[1:49:42] prick that little check
[1:49:44] of the holy ghost
[1:49:46] i've heard people say i've got to check
[1:49:48] in my spirit about that then you better
[1:49:50] listen
[1:49:51] you better listen to that
[1:49:54] that might be something else
[1:49:56] you need to be able to go then and say
[1:49:58] to our lord is this you and recognize
[1:50:01] his voice because there's a relationship
[1:50:03] that's being developed in us
[1:50:06] personal holiness and that's what we
[1:50:07] were talking about there for just a
[1:50:09] moment personal holiness
[1:50:12] the convictions the things that we do
[1:50:15] differently than the world around us
[1:50:18] the language that we use you know i i
[1:50:20] have come to to hear
[1:50:23] and to understand
[1:50:24] that the church world today
[1:50:26] and at large
[1:50:28] the the full gospel charismatic uh
[1:50:32] genre of church entity today
[1:50:35] they they
[1:50:36] many of of them will say things like
[1:50:39] you know uh oh the occasional curse word
[1:50:42] uh the occasional profanity you know
[1:50:45] that that's just a a part of being god
[1:50:47] doesn't i want you to know something my
[1:50:49] bible tells me something else
[1:50:51] my bible tells us that by the spirit of
[1:50:54] holiness in us
[1:50:55] that we should be able to control the
[1:50:57] words that come out of our mouth we
[1:50:59] should be able to cast down thoughts and
[1:51:01] pull down imaginations that are about to
[1:51:04] cause us to say things that will weaken
[1:51:06] the testimony that we hold with others
[1:51:10] it's by the spirit of holiness because
[1:51:12] the holy ghost can be a restrainer
[1:51:15] and it's by the spirit of holiness that
[1:51:17] we are being pulled back sometime from
[1:51:19] things that that we have made ourselves
[1:51:21] a part of language that we hear i want
[1:51:24] to tell you something if you constantly
[1:51:26] are hearing that kind of language it's
[1:51:28] going to be very difficult to keep that
[1:51:29] out of your vocabulary it's going to be
[1:51:32] much harder if you're all the time
[1:51:34] watching stuff and
[1:51:35] and putting yourself around people who
[1:51:37] talk like that all the time and never
[1:51:39] speaking up for truth or never saying
[1:51:41] hey i wish you wouldn't talk that way in
[1:51:43] front of me i'm not trying to be
[1:51:45] religious i'm trying to keep my spirit
[1:51:48] clean before the lord
[1:51:50] the church has seemed to accept this
[1:51:52] kind of thing the church seems to accept
[1:51:55] out there a lot of places social
[1:51:56] drinking
[1:51:58] and the occasional marijuana
[1:52:00] and drug a little bit of you know a
[1:52:03] little bit of upper or whatever well we
[1:52:05] all have to do what we have to do folks
[1:52:08] don't you understand
[1:52:10] that you've got what you need if you've
[1:52:13] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:52:15] you've got the helper you've got the
[1:52:17] convictor you've got the deliverer
[1:52:20] you've got the one who has come to teach
[1:52:22] you about the holiness of god and so
[1:52:24] there are decisions that we make that
[1:52:27] reflect a personal holiness
[1:52:30] there are there are things we choose to
[1:52:32] do and not to do that reflect a personal
[1:52:35] holiness and this is right
[1:52:37] but personal holiness develops as an
[1:52:41] overflow of your relationship
[1:52:44] and your intimacy with him
[1:52:46] the closer you draw to him in
[1:52:49] relationship
[1:52:50] the more you are willing to lay
[1:52:52] everything else before him and allow the
[1:52:56] spirit of holiness to evaluate it
[1:52:59] and show you
[1:53:01] i know that even sometimes
[1:53:04] christians and sometimes believers are
[1:53:07] are picking up clothing styles that that
[1:53:11] are are tighter and shorter and and uh
[1:53:16] sometimes you wonder if someone is on
[1:53:18] the inside of a dress fighting to get
[1:53:20] out or on the outside of a dress
[1:53:22] fighting to get in
[1:53:24] you see people even in church following
[1:53:27] these traditions and fads and things
[1:53:29] that are happening out there wanting to
[1:53:31] reflect that wanting to be modern
[1:53:33] wanting to be so forth etc but i want
[1:53:35] you to know if you will allow the holy
[1:53:37] spirit to work in your life by the
[1:53:40] spirit of holiness he starts on the
[1:53:42] inside
[1:53:43] he starts putting his finger on what it
[1:53:46] is that makes you want to present
[1:53:48] yourself that way
[1:53:51] now you sometimes hear people especially
[1:53:53] around the message of truth talk about
[1:53:55] high-heeled shoes
[1:53:57] and they say things
[1:53:59] against that and i want you to know
[1:54:01] something here did you realize that a
[1:54:04] person can walk barefooted or a person
[1:54:07] can walk in flats a woman can walk in
[1:54:09] flat but have such a seductive spirit on
[1:54:12] her that she's twisting her body and and
[1:54:15] advertising herself even though she
[1:54:18] doesn't have on
[1:54:19] any kind of a heel on her shoe because
[1:54:22] it's it's not the shoe
[1:54:24] now i think that
[1:54:26] that believers ought to be careful with
[1:54:28] those kinds of things
[1:54:30] i i do
[1:54:31] but i want you to know it's not the shoe
[1:54:34] it's a spirit that wants to get on
[1:54:36] somebody to cause them to move in such a
[1:54:39] seductive way
[1:54:41] and to attract attention in a seductive
[1:54:44] way instead of in a christ-like manner
[1:54:46] oh i know it's getting quiet out there
[1:54:48] now i know i must be stepping on
[1:54:50] somebody i know somebody must say oh
[1:54:53] listen to all that legalism but i want
[1:54:55] to tell you somebody has got to speak to
[1:54:57] their people and i'm speaking to mine
[1:54:59] today i'm so thankful for every visitor
[1:55:02] that's watching but i'm speaking to my
[1:55:04] own people
[1:55:05] there is a spirit of this world that
[1:55:08] wants to get on us and if we allow the
[1:55:10] spirit of holiness to work and put his
[1:55:12] finger on the root of the problem
[1:55:15] instead of always looking at the outward
[1:55:17] manifestation but find the inward
[1:55:20] problem and there's something wrong with
[1:55:22] somebody who feel there's something
[1:55:24] wrong with a woman there's something
[1:55:25] wrong with a man that feels like they
[1:55:27] have to always put their body on display
[1:55:30] in public there's something wrong on the
[1:55:33] inside
[1:55:34] do you hear what i'm preaching today and
[1:55:36] so the holy spirit by the spirit of
[1:55:39] holiness he wants to work on that he
[1:55:41] wants to help that because once you are
[1:55:44] able to identify that what god does for
[1:55:47] you on the inside it begins to manifest
[1:55:49] on the outside and you do not want to
[1:55:52] present christ in you that way you want
[1:55:55] to testify of him in in a way that
[1:55:59] shines
[1:56:00] with the glory of god and not with the
[1:56:03] glitter of this world is there anybody
[1:56:06] amending me out there uh my phone's
[1:56:08] getting a little quiet here i need to
[1:56:11] know that somebody is hearing what i'm
[1:56:13] saying today
[1:56:14] you see there is a true change that
[1:56:17] takes place in our lives
[1:56:19] our decisions our choices the way we
[1:56:22] carry ourself etc when there is a
[1:56:25] genuine change that takes place in our
[1:56:28] heart
[1:56:29] if you look up the word holiness that's
[1:56:32] used here
[1:56:33] in romans 1
[1:56:35] according to the spirit of holiness and
[1:56:38] i'm nearly done
[1:56:39] there's four minutes till one now
[1:56:42] according to the spirit of holiness if
[1:56:44] you look up that word holiness in the
[1:56:46] greek
[1:56:48] it's uh it's strong's greek word 42.
[1:56:51] it's it's it's one of those
[1:56:53] uh low numbers
[1:56:56] it means the process
[1:56:59] quality
[1:57:00] and condition
[1:57:02] of a holy disposition
[1:57:05] and the quality of holiness
[1:57:09] in personal
[1:57:10] conduct
[1:57:12] that is the definition of the word that
[1:57:14] is used here in romans 1 as the spirit
[1:57:17] of holiness
[1:57:19] the process quality and condition of a
[1:57:24] holy disposition
[1:57:26] and the quality of holiness in personal
[1:57:30] contact
[1:57:31] you see his
[1:57:33] holiness
[1:57:35] resting on our lives is the principle
[1:57:39] that sets the believer apart from the
[1:57:42] world
[1:57:44] it's not our idea
[1:57:46] of what holiness is
[1:57:49] that sets us apart
[1:57:51] from the world around us it is an
[1:57:53] encounter
[1:57:55] with his holiness
[1:57:57] when we encounter his holiness
[1:58:00] and it transfers
[1:58:02] from the inside out
[1:58:05] that is what sets us apart
[1:58:07] from the world around us
[1:58:09] i like to use this example and i'm going
[1:58:11] to close and i thank god for helping me
[1:58:14] get all the way through page one
[1:58:17] that was about all the territory we
[1:58:19] covered but i like to use this example
[1:58:23] one day in scripture
[1:58:25] there was a mountain there was a hill
[1:58:28] there was a prophet
[1:58:30] and on that mountain there were many
[1:58:32] bushes
[1:58:34] i don't know if there were any tall
[1:58:37] trees or not
[1:58:40] because of the arid desert environment
[1:58:44] but there were many many scrub bushes
[1:58:48] there were many rocks and boulders and
[1:58:51] maybe even uh what we would call desert
[1:58:54] grasses
[1:58:56] various forms of vegetation
[1:59:00] and there were switchback
[1:59:04] sheep trails
[1:59:06] up and down
[1:59:07] that old
[1:59:08] dusty hillside
[1:59:10] where the goats and the sheep
[1:59:13] would make their way to higher places
[1:59:18] and eat the vegetation the old scrub
[1:59:22] bushes and
[1:59:23] and the grasses that would grow all the
[1:59:25] vegetation that would grow on that hill
[1:59:28] so it was very common
[1:59:30] to see a shepherd
[1:59:32] walking up one of those switchback
[1:59:34] trails
[1:59:36] with a with a pack a herd of sheep or
[1:59:38] goats
[1:59:40] looking for
[1:59:41] some vegetation
[1:59:43] especially in the dry season when there
[1:59:46] was no rain
[1:59:47] and one day god almighty elohim
[1:59:52] the eternal one
[1:59:54] decided today
[1:59:57] i'm going to have an appointment with a
[2:00:00] man
[2:00:01] i'm going to come down
[2:00:04] from my high place
[2:00:06] and i'm going to speak to a prophet
[2:00:09] i'm going to commission a shepherd
[2:00:12] i'm going to take one who has watched
[2:00:15] over the flocks
[2:00:17] of his father-in-law
[2:00:19] and i'm going to send him as a mighty
[2:00:22] prophet of god
[2:00:24] to deliver my people
[2:00:26] out of egyptian slavery how many of you
[2:00:29] recognize the story now we're talking
[2:00:31] about moshe we're talking about moses
[2:00:35] and when god made that appointment that
[2:00:39] day in his own mind he said i'm going
[2:00:41] down
[2:00:42] he chose the way
[2:00:44] that he would speak to moses
[2:00:47] you know i don't think you will
[2:00:49] find that i'm trying to be funny
[2:00:52] if i tell you that god could have used
[2:00:54] one of those sheep
[2:00:55] we have a record in the bible where god
[2:00:58] spoke out of a donkey
[2:01:00] so god could have chosen a sheep
[2:01:03] and spoken his message
[2:01:06] to
[2:01:07] moses
[2:01:08] but he chose rather to come down
[2:01:12] in a pillar of fire
[2:01:15] and to land
[2:01:16] in one of those bushes
[2:01:19] on that mountain that day
[2:01:22] and when he did
[2:01:24] i don't know how god chose
[2:01:27] which bush
[2:01:28] perhaps he chose it because of its
[2:01:31] proximity
[2:01:33] to where moses was walking
[2:01:35] with a herd
[2:01:37] but but but he did he chose a bush
[2:01:41] and the fire of god the almighty pillar
[2:01:44] of fire fell that day
[2:01:46] on an ordinary
[2:01:48] bush
[2:01:51] 30 seconds
[2:01:53] before
[2:01:54] the fire of god filled up that bush
[2:01:58] it was just a bush
[2:02:00] just an ordinary
[2:02:03] scraggly
[2:02:04] bush
[2:02:06] on a hillside
[2:02:08] in the land of god's people
[2:02:10] but in the moment that the pillar of
[2:02:13] fire fell on that old scrubby bush
[2:02:16] it was no longer just an ordinary bush
[2:02:20] it was now
[2:02:22] holy ground
[2:02:25] not only was the bush
[2:02:27] made holy
[2:02:28] because the pillar of fire fell on the
[2:02:31] bush but the ground around that bush
[2:02:35] became holy ground because a holy god
[2:02:40] had come down
[2:02:42] in his holiness
[2:02:44] in his power to
[2:02:46] reveal himself and his plan
[2:02:50] to moses
[2:02:52] what was so special about about that
[2:02:54] bush nothing
[2:02:56] was it more beautiful than the rest
[2:02:58] probably not was it healthier than the
[2:03:01] rest probably not what made that bush so
[2:03:05] special i tell you it was god's choice
[2:03:09] on it it was god falling on it in the
[2:03:12] pillar of fire that made it a special
[2:03:15] and chosen bush
[2:03:18] as i said 30 seconds before just a bush
[2:03:20] but now
[2:03:21] a chosen vessel
[2:03:24] that god was going to speak from that
[2:03:29] bush
[2:03:31] the fire was going to talk to moses
[2:03:35] and he said to moses
[2:03:37] take off your shoes
[2:03:39] for the ground that you now stand on
[2:03:43] is holy ground
[2:03:44] what made the ground holy what made the
[2:03:47] bush holy god's holiness
[2:03:51] fell
[2:03:52] that day
[2:03:53] on that bush
[2:03:55] and on that ground it was no longer
[2:03:58] ordinary bush it was no longer ordinary
[2:04:02] ground
[2:04:03] i'm going to ask the musicians to come
[2:04:06] it was now god's choice
[2:04:10] his holiness
[2:04:13] was now
[2:04:14] making it more
[2:04:16] than what it had ever been
[2:04:19] before
[2:04:21] this is what makes you holy
[2:04:23] this is what makes me holy now there is
[2:04:26] a way to walk in holiness
[2:04:29] there is a way to demonstrate personal
[2:04:32] holiness but all the good that i can do
[2:04:36] doesn't make me holy enough
[2:04:38] did you remember that the prophet of the
[2:04:41] old testament tells us
[2:04:44] that all of our righteousness
[2:04:47] is but filthy rags
[2:04:50] all tables full of vomit full of
[2:04:53] defilement
[2:04:54] so if you and i would live the best life
[2:04:58] you hear that phrase sometime living my
[2:05:01] best life
[2:05:02] i'm not sure i really understand what's
[2:05:05] being said
[2:05:06] because your best life is a surrendered
[2:05:09] life
[2:05:10] and it may not look like somebody else's
[2:05:13] best life
[2:05:15] you've got to discover what god wants to
[2:05:18] make of you
[2:05:19] you've got to discover what god wants to
[2:05:22] do in you and for you and through you
[2:05:25] and when you do that you have found your
[2:05:28] best life
[2:05:30] i want you to know
[2:05:31] we can live the best of our best do the
[2:05:34] best of our best make all right choices
[2:05:38] look right walk right dress right talk
[2:05:40] right
[2:05:42] and still not be
[2:05:44] a real reflection
[2:05:46] of his holiness
[2:05:48] because it's not our doing only that
[2:05:51] matters
[2:05:52] it's what is being
[2:05:54] accomplished on the inside
[2:05:57] it's an encounter with his holiness that
[2:06:01] makes the difference
[2:06:04] when he filled you with the holy ghost
[2:06:06] the holy ghost came to work in your life
[2:06:09] in all of these ministries
[2:06:11] in all of these offices and i'm only
[2:06:14] here to remind you of them
[2:06:16] because i think sometimes we forget
[2:06:19] who's really on board
[2:06:21] he will lead you and guide you into all
[2:06:23] truth
[2:06:24] he will so personally teach you and
[2:06:27] train you
[2:06:28] what is acceptable in his sight and what
[2:06:31] is not acceptable in his sight but in
[2:06:34] order to come to that place you have to
[2:06:36] lay all of your righteousness before him
[2:06:39] and say lord here's mine here's what i'm
[2:06:42] able to accomplish and i know none of it
[2:06:45] is enough so i'm asking you to come and
[2:06:47] live inside of me
[2:06:49] let your holiness be reproduced
[2:06:53] let your holiness be demonstrated by my
[2:06:56] life by my choices
[2:06:58] by my actions by the way i treat others
[2:07:01] by the way i conduct myself out in in
[2:07:05] this world
[2:07:06] let my life be a light
[2:07:08] shining out through the night the old
[2:07:11] song that we used to sing i want us to
[2:07:14] worship i want us to take just a moment
[2:07:17] to come back together
[2:07:19] in our hearts of worship and let's sing
[2:07:22] to the lord for just a moment and then
[2:07:24] we're going to release you for your
[2:07:26] sunday afternoon
[2:07:28] we're just going to take a moment to
[2:07:31] lift him up and to magnify his name he's
[2:07:34] worthy aren't you glad the spirit of
[2:07:37] holiness is in you by the holy ghost
[2:07:40] aren't you glad you've got a teacher
[2:07:42] inside of you
[2:07:43] who desires to help you and to lead you
[2:07:46] and and to help set your life in order

[2:20:28] grant it today
[2:20:30] i want to just say to those of you that
[2:20:32] have sent in prayer requests
[2:20:35] not related to covid
[2:20:38] god sees those needs
[2:20:40] and we're going to continue to lift them
[2:20:42] up to him and believe god
[2:20:46] even those that have come in
[2:20:48] asking that the prayer request
[2:20:50] be
[2:20:51] kept confidential
[2:20:54] you've reached out in faith
[2:20:56] and i know that faith touches the lord
[2:21:00] he's our healer
[2:21:01] he's our helper he's our savior
[2:21:05] because we are not gathered today as a
[2:21:07] congregation
[2:21:09] in person i just want to remind you
[2:21:12] that you can give
[2:21:15] you can use the app
[2:21:17] you can go online to our website
[2:21:22] you can
[2:21:23] if you're local here
[2:21:26] i don't know exactly what our work
[2:21:28] schedule will be this week but there's
[2:21:30] almost always someone here nine to five
[2:21:33] or nine to four
[2:21:36] and uh monday tuesday and wednesday of
[2:21:38] this week i know for sure
[2:21:41] that there will be somebody here between
[2:21:42] those hours
[2:21:44] if you'll just send a text to benjamin
[2:21:47] to hawk to myself
[2:21:50] we will be happy to
[2:21:52] meet you at the door
[2:21:55] and uh
[2:21:57] receive your tithe and offering and
[2:22:00] put it in the bank and pay the church
[2:22:02] bills
[2:22:04] god is faithful
[2:22:06] he's never left us without enough
[2:22:09] our trust is in him
[2:22:11] but i know that there are those who will
[2:22:13] not remember if we don't just remind you
[2:22:16] today that it's just easy to go right on
[2:22:18] the app to go right on the website or to
[2:22:21] arrange to come when i got here today
[2:22:23] there was already people that already
[2:22:25] just stopped by and dropped off
[2:22:28] and god bless you for that
[2:22:30] but it's uh
[2:22:32] probably a good idea to do it when you
[2:22:33] know we're here
[2:22:35] for safety reason
[2:22:37] but i want to thank you for what was
[2:22:38] given today and that will go in i'm

[2:22:47] mentioned in this total yet but tuesday
[2:22:50] night we'll bring it last weekend was
[2:22:52] the first sunday of the month and
[2:22:54] brother greeley ministered to us and he
[2:22:56] received the offering
[2:22:58] for the principal payment and last week
[2:23:01] the offering was 5000
[2:23:06] i want to thank god for every bit of
[2:23:08] that
[2:23:09] you are giving and every month
