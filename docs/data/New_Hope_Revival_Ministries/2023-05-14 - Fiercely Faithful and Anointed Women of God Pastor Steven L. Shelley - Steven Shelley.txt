these hydrangeas and your dad will plant it for you or your mom we'd like to count on David but we know he's done his part he's done no I'm kidding he's the proudest Papa you've ever seen uh but I knew there was going to be a tie 25. that's about as young as I want it to get Jana how old are you we might make an exception I knew there was going to be a tie breaker and the Lord just blessed me to think well yes they're both the same age one or young another but one has most recently had the baby so that's three uh we've got youngest and we've got oldest and now we will get the mother who

it planted and we want to say to all of the mothers but to these special Mothers we want to say again happy Mother's Day thank you all for worshiping with us today we have a gift here and I I know that sometimes it's not easy coming up but I really liked it this time um it is a it's a devotional but it's a prayer Journal it has lots of empty spaces for you to write your prayer names and prayer requests and your answered prayers I hope you have to buy another notebook to write all your answered prayers in it but about this time last year we were preaching on Joy so uh the pen you can have a journal and a pen to both of them say on their joy in the journey and I like that because there's a lot of other things in the journey but you've got to find joy in the journey so we're not going to have you to come right now we're going to do that at the end of the service but I wanted you to know that we have something for you this morning isn't the Lord good he's so good let's praise God again let me just do this real quick God bless every one of you who are on the Stream and uh I didn't even realize this till this morning that they uh go ahead and put the title on YouTube or it was there for the service this morning the title is there because I saw where sister Martha I thought am I looking at the right one give me just a moment sister Martha Miller said I already like the the name of the message this morning is fiercely faithful and anointed women of God fiercely faithful and anointed women of God guess what you all don't have to have a Mother's Day sermon on being submissive and dominating women I believe that we should be submissive sister should be submissive and I believe women do have a tendency to be dominating but I don't believe that all women are that way you're quiet I was just announcing the theme in many of our churches this morning there are many churches around this message that will be the message it'll start out happy Mother's day God bless all the mothers and then there will be about an hour and a half making sure the women remember that they're related to Eve that's rough talk I'm doing ain't it I must be getting old but I hope at the end they'll come on around to where we'll end today there was a woman who really got things out of whack but there was one in the end who said be it unto me according to Thy Word and you sisters are more related to Mary today than you are to Eve you are because the Holy Ghost has placed you there amen so let's bless all of these streamers here sister Martha Miller yes she saw the title I love this sermon already just from the title God bless you brother Garth and Sarnia Ontario brother Merlin Arizona uh uh sister Deb and Brother David in Indiana and the Netherlands we send our love to to the van hootens in the Netherlands and and Jonathan is on here wishing all you mothers a Happy Mother's Day and uh my my friend Dora is watching on Facebook and there's a host of other people we just we just send our love to every one of you today we do and we wish that we could all be together but it's just not always possible is it and then uh tomorrow is Casey Hannah's birthday and she's uh not with us but uh we we always like to remember her birthday because she's a walking talking miracle and uh they're attending the church in the Grange right now I don't care I'm just thankful they're in church after all these years of not being in church I'm glad they're in church and would love to have them here this is where they belong in case you should hear this service this is where you should be but thank God that you're there and uh so her birthday is on Monday and brother Shaw uh is his birthday is coming up this week let's see you're about 80 79 something like that how old is he Benjamin oh he's not he's just as distinguished I don't want to say handsome they'll say something about it if I do but he's just as distinguished as he was the first time I met him we wish him a happy birthday on Thursday sister Deborah Box away happy birthday to you in Calgary and uh then on Saturday of this week is Graves anniversary how many years brother Robert now I ask you on purpose thank you has it oh my goodness that's a long time that that has gone by quickly for for me I don't know about for you all but it's going by quickly anyway in gone good let's stand and get ready for the word nobody turned in a special song for those of you that don't know that's how we do it sometimes we'll have four in a service and we can't do that but then we'll have several in a row where no one has a song or turns it in we don't call on singers here our policy is if the Lord lays a song on your heart you let us know and if we feel like it fits the service we ask for the title because we feel like if it fits the service what we've got for worship what we've got for the word then we want to hear from the Lord and so if you feel that in the future reach out to Benjamin he that's his Department uh or you can reach out to me as well and we will get a song because we like special singing I don't want you to think we don't but we also want to leave plenty of time for the word this morning and uh I worried all week what I would preach and then it all came at one time and so I got a lot a lot to do 15 pages to do this morning we'll never get to them will we amen what can we sing to get people ready I used to sing a song but I couldn't sing it this morning when when Mama Prayed Heaven paid attention and I believe that I believe that we are many of us here are products uh results beneficiaries of mama's tears and Mama's prayers and my life was a little bit different I spent most of my life praying for my mama and then the Lord saved her and she spent the rest of her life praying for me and you know that's all right I'm thankful I I've had several nice texts sister Cindy that was so sweet of you brother Billy and others who reached out to me this morning remembering that it would be my first birthday knowing that my mother is not here it's not my first mother not birthday Mother's Day not my first Mother's day without her being in service but but being on this Earth and all I can say is it feels a little a little sad but mostly good and mostly glad I wouldn't want her to have to come back to the body that she was living in I wouldn't want her to have to come back for nothing in this world and I look forward to seeing her in a new body amen and I know that you who have had a mother to die in faith you feel the same way you'd love to have one more conversation you know one more meal I'd like to have one more of my mama's meals uh but we'll have eternity well what a different atmosphere it will be and we're we're looking forward to that this morning uh I don't even know a song I don't have to be I can't even think of a song what a day that will be sing that with me as we get ready to go to the word what a day that will be with my cheeks [Music] look on his face the one who saved me by his grace when he takes me by the hand and leads me through the Promise Land oh what a day what a glorious day that will be now there'll be no sorrow there and no more burdens to bear no sickness no more pain there'll be no more power over there and forever I will be where the one who died for me what a day what a glorious day that will be sing with me the last time what a day oh what a day [Music] when my Jesus [Music] when I look [Music] he's the one who saved me [Music] and he'll take me by the hand me through Promised Land what a day what a glorious day that will be you believe that let's praise God let's thank the Lord for the musicians God bless every one of you turn to Proverbs chapter 31. that's only our starting spot the message this morning is entitled fiercely faithful and anointed women of God if I had a subtitle it would be don't mess with Mama Bear fiercely faithful and anointed women of God I'm thankful to be the pastor of some fiercely faithful and anointed women of God proverbs 31 verse 10 through 12 who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband to safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life did you know that one of the biggest hindrances in relationships today is trust did you know that a lack of trust will hinder your relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ did you know that if there is no trust in a marriage you have a broken relationship and once trust is broken it is very very hard to build it up again but a vow is a vow a vow is a vow and we have to pray through until trust can be restored in verse in verse 25 we're skipping down to 25 through 31 strength and honor are her clothing and she shall rejoice in time to come she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness not sharpness hello let's let's amen the truth not sharpness in her mouth is the law of kindness and just because you're over 50. doesn't give you the right not to operate with a tongue in the law of kindness no matter how many years God blesses you with on this Earth precious mothers and wives and Sisters of the Lord let the law of kindness be in your mouth not accusation not sharpness not bitterness come on you liked it while ago you liked it while ago now you get quiet we've got to make sure nothing gives us the right to carry the law of sharpness bitterness malice in our mouth kindness I tell you kindness in a home in a relationship both parties speaking kindly to one another can cover a whole lot of mistakes is that the truth next verse she looketh well to the ways of her household her household is her priority I'm preaching now not climbing the corporate ladder it's not that she can't oh a woman can do anything she sets her mind to do you'd be surprised how she can tuck her skirt and climb a tree if she has to situate her skirt and ride a horse if she has to she could lead a company I have no doubt in my mind that a woman could lead a company or a nation if necessary so don't you think that I think that but I just believe there's a higher calling higher than being a president or a CEO of a company and higher than being the leader of a Nation powerful when a woman dedicates her life to her household and she eated not the bread of idleness and I will tell you this that Instagram and social media uh has greatly hindered a virtuous woman in our day because she can certainly so quickly like men like anybody else can so quickly be distracted by those things out just slightly perhaps out of her reach an ideal life that doesn't exist a picture made of a clean countertop while the rest of the house is filthy and women will get attracted to that sometime just like a man can get attracted to sports scores and go right down the list and read and watch all the clips and so forth but but a woman who is dedicated to the cleanliness and orderliness of her household should be honored she should be respected and one who doesn't eat the bread of idleness we ought to salute her her children rise up and call her blessed are you with me her husband also and he God had his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated I want to preach he prayeth her did you know you get a whole lot more with honey than you do with vinegar did you know sometimes husbands don't get what they're looking for because they they serve more vinegar than they do honey amen oh wish I had a wife that would do this and this and this and the other well you instead of instead of trying to yell at her to change her that'll never work you try to honor her and attract her with some sweet words and some kindness and you'll be surprised she was created to respond to that she was taken from inside the man she she craves being protected you just raise up and defend her come on brothers you just raise up and defend your wife all right even against your own mother sometime I'm already preaching and I hadn't even got to my notes you know you you may have a mother that is is a bit possessive like mine and there was a time that you have to stand up sometime you're my mama but that's my queen come on now and you'd be surprised how how far that goes in building a relationship amen her husband should praise her you you may have to creatively find the things to call out but you start doing that you'll realize they're a whole lot more than you realized before just a minute Amen brother Shelley shame on any of us Brothers making it hard on our wives to be what God created them to be and we think we could belittle them or abuse them into submission no there's only one way to cause a woman to submit and that is to love her and cherish her like Christ loved the church and gave himself for the church you come Father's Day I lift up the fathers don't you worry I think men are terribly belittled and devalued in our society so I'll preach to the fathers don't you worry but I'm telling you if you feel like your wife or your the mother of your children is somehow slack in any in any way the biblical way to help her get up to her highest height is to praise her there amen don't break your teeth but eat the biscuit and if you can't brag on it just do like I've had to do with some ugly babies along the way you just say oh honey I've never had another one just like it don't beat it on the table throw it at the dog her children rise up and call her bless her husband also and he praisetheth her oh my I wonder how long it's been since some of us have praised our wives now that's not the same devotion you give to God but it's the same word and you know what it simply means to lift up I'm telling you you will you will benefit it's a little sneaky but you will benefit in life if you will learn to lift up your wife and the mother of your children and your children even you grown children because there's a lot of grown children today that never got really grown you want more out of your mother you lift her up sometime that's right it's just the right way you see this is not a foreign concept because it's how Believers should treat believers we need to lift one another up you know it's never right for us to wag our head and say he got what he deserved that's my brother it may be he may be reaping what he sowed but I'd like to lift him up if I can if at all possible let's go on I can see that I'm going to have a time today many daughters have done virtuously but Solomon says in this but thou excellest them all every man should come to a place that he feels that way about the mother of his children thou excellus them all a couple more verses faith faith is deceitful and beauty is vain we've mentioned a little bit around here Tuesday night about the falseness of our society that's what we're dealing with in this hour it's not Beauty it's vanity it's phony it's fake the worst thing to me to see I'll be honest with you the most unattractive and nearly disgusting thing that I see in this world today is a woman who thinks she's a Barbie doll I don't have anything wrong with a woman being slim if she's capable of being that I'm not against blonde hair come on that's not what I'm talking about I'm not against her Living in a Dream boat and being married to Barbie that's not what I'm doing no no no no but I'm talking about phoniness Ken what did I say some of you know how prophetic I can be I don't know my children didn't play with Barbie dolls I didn't let my girls play with them so I don't know uh it was not something that I wanted them to ever see as real it's a mental disease it's a mental disease it's a mental ailment that women get sometimes that they want to look did you know it's it's been in the news at times that a woman would take one of those things from Walmart and go to the doctor and say this is what I want there's human Barbie dolls and if you folks are attractive to that if there's a man here that's attracted to that I know where you got that attraction go back and hear the sermon Tuesday night and you'll know where you got it that's not attractive favor is it's deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the Lord I don't care if she Waddles when she walks if she fears the Lord I don't care if your complexion could use a little help if she fears the Lord I don't care if her nose is crooked and her lips are too thin if she fears the Lord she should be praised if we've got a wife who loves the Lord who wants to raise our children in the faith we should praise her and thank her and lift her up every opportunity that we can and it's Bible to do so and verse 31 give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates that's a virtuous woman I know virtuous women I know fiercely faithful and anointed women of God many of whom are mothers many of them have not yet had that blessing many will I have a friend on Facebook that I've known personally for many many years who never married a singer a songwriter a beautiful girl she wrote that little song Here I Am that one little lost lamb and here I am he went searching for that one little lost lamb and here I am she never married I read her post yesterday and she wrote about what kind of a mother I think I would have been what kind of a giver I think I would have been and how I think I would have but but it wasn't it wasn't she never married so she didn't give that opportunity and so she said I realized in my life that I would find another way to give and to give and to serve I'm not preaching only to mothers today I'm preaching to fiercely faithful and anointed women of God who should be honored who should be recognized who should be remembered and I like what brother Brandon said about Mother's Day He said they've made it made it a big commercial thing he said why can you imagine giving your mother flowers one day out of the year I thought you all liked the quotes he said can you imagine giving your mother he said every day ought to be Mother's Day you ought to honor and love your mother and we can say your wife as the mother of your children every day of the you'll have a lot happier life how many of you have ever heard happy wife how many of you have ever heard if mama ain't happy you don't even have to have a verse Society sometimes will tell us we can just learn so I'm preaching about fiercely faithful and anointed women of God and I'm also preaching about Mama bears in Exodus chapter 2 verse one through four I want to talk to you about a fiercely faithful anointed woman of God her name was yokabed she was a mother with a plan the Bible said there went a man out of the house of Levi and took to wife a daughter of Levi priest Priestly families both of them and the woman conceived and bear a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months and when she could no longer hide him she took for him an ark of bull rushes and dobbed it with slime and with pitch and put the child there in and she laid it in the flags by the rivers Bank and his sister stood afar off to wit what would be done to him we know this story like we know our own story a decree was made that all the male children were going to be killed even first The Midwives were told that you should do away with the boys and now a decree goes out that says all the male firstborns excuse me all the male babies that are born are to die and uh the next thing you know here is Yoga bed or yogavid who is swelling in her belly and she realizes that she is going to be a mother and it is the most inopportune time it couldn't be a more inconvenient time to have a child in in the in the atmosphere in the political environment that they were living in right then knowing that if this child were a baby boy that he would not survive and yet she nourished that child and she took care of herself and she watched what she ate and she watched what she did and she was careful not to fall down and she was careful not to do something so dangerous because she was nourishing a lot not knowing whether exactly what was going on in her womb not knowing exactly what this baby was going to be but God began to talk to her talks to Mama sometimes and he began to talk to her about the destiny of her child and he began to tell her I believe with all my heart that he began to tell her a deliverer is coming in your womb and she began to thank God for that little baby and you know what I believe she began to talk to him now his name wasn't Moses then because he wasn't named until he was Drew out of the water that's what Moses means Moshe means to be drawn from the water I don't know what she was calling him when he was in her belly but but she was talking to him and she was telling him you've got a destiny ahead of you perhaps she already began to to speak words of life as some of you mothers have done and science has borne out the reality that the child can recognize its mother's voice if it constantly is hearing that in the womb I believe that a mama should bless that child and speak Words of Life to that child and tell that baby you're wanted your Mom and Daddy can hardly wait to get you here and I think you've got to practice being just as exuberant on number five as you were number one because the destiny of every one of your individual children is powerful and beautiful in the sight of God and they deserve your attention I preached very strongly that a mother shouldn't bear more children than she is able to devote herself to and the father should not expect to Father more children than he can financially provide for that number may be different in different homes and families like brother Branham told us about birth control that's an that's a that's an interview matter that's a matter I might discuss with you privately we'll talk about that uh privately there is no law that just comes right down in the community on certain things like that we're not in the Roman Catholic system but I don't think a mother should continue to have children that she can't nurt you and care for I knew this would be a little rough getting started just a moment Amen brother you you shouldn't child into the world and expect somebody else to nurture that child on your behalf my may God raise up lots of nurturers for your children I wanted mine to have as many loved ones as they could have I wanted as many people to love my children as possibly could love them because they need that they need a community but I didn't want to have any more than we could pour ourselves into as a mama and a dad and my my responsibility is pretty heavy here I wanted to to please God in those things and I encourage you young couples to do the same watch your life watch where you are watch where you are financially you speak into that life when that little baby is growing in the womb Hallelujah aren't we blessed to have three beautiful babies here and more on the way may God bless them every time you think of them will you pray for them that God will protect them from every disease every hindrance if you've got a fever will you love them from a distance if you've been sneezing and coughing and hecking and carrying on when you love them from across the room how many of you believe wisdom is an important virtue it don't always run in families wisdom sometimes comes by experience and we want to use all that we can because we're all Guardians I'll be honest with you they all belong to me come on you're I'm not their mother I'm not their father but there belonged to me in some ways I'm responsible to help shape their Destiny from this house I can't replace her daddy I can't replace their mother or their grandparents but I have a responsibility this church Community has a responsibility one of the things God told us when he placed Us in this building was to build stronger families and that's what we want to do we don't want to lose any of our teenagers to the world we want to submit them to God as early as possible and keep them there with everything that is within us hear this woman she said I don't know how it's all going to turn out but I believe God's going to use you little fella I may not know the extent of it but I know that God is going to use you one of these days and then the Bible tells us here that when she saw the child she said this is a goodly child it's a strange statement that I have I hope you will stay with me this is a strange statement that I have preached about multiple times through the years when you hear that word good or goodly it makes you wonder is there ever a mother that would see her little child and say he's he's bad no you see brother random knew there was a difference between being a baby mama and the mother he preached to us that there's women who bear children that aren't mothers he said it he talked about one throwed their baby in the river he said now that wasn't a mama that wasn't a mother she may be a woman that had a baby he understood and it doesn't seem reasonable that any mother would have a child and say you're a bad little baby why did the Bible record that yokovic said you are a goodly child because that's from the Hebrew word Tove and it means when you see something bringing forth a harvest of the destiny that was in it in its planting in its beginning when God started creation and he looked at it and he said it's good the word is told and it means I already see your future and you are already producing what I know that you will produce so she was prophesying hello she was prophesying over her baby you're a goodly child you're a Tove child I see you as a as a hero bringing forth the seed of your destiny as you grow older come on now that's why mother should never a father should never use words like you're rebellious you're a loser you're stupid oh that's not the way to cause them to bring forth tov I see you bringing forth life I see you serving God and raising your family in the fear of the Lord come on she was prophesying over that little child she as I told you a moment ago she was a a levite woman and she didn't wait until that baby was born until she started formulating a plan you get a mama with a plan and you've got something Brother come on she said I gotta figure a way if indeed this is a boy I've got to find a way to hide this child and she she started making her a little basket she began to weave the bull rushes together she began to pitch that thing with slime and tar she knew the day was coming that she wouldn't be able to hide that child anymore she couldn't nurse that child anymore can you imagine having to give your child up at three months old literally peeling that child off of your breast and laying him in a little basket and putting him in a crocodile infested River full of Whirlwind of whirlpools sorry full of whirlpools but she knew that there was a god who never makes mistakes and God didn't give her that baby in the wrong season he gave her that baby in a season where a deliverer was needed the whole world might have said what a sorry time for a baby to be born but God said this is right on time this isn't an ordinary baby this is a seed of Destiny this is a Prophet this is a deliverer he will be a forerunner of the Messiah come on he's going to lead his people out she had to peel that child off of her nursing breast Place him in a in a in a a basket of hope that she had crafted with her own hands and she had to lay him down in a body of water full of crocodiles and whirlpools brother Branham in that little in that little sermon the story of Moses where he dramatias is the story so beautifully it could capture anybody's attention he talks about a crocodile smelling that little baby in the in the basket and swimming over there and an angel of God comes down in thumps that old crocodile on the snout and say you get back over to that bank where you belong this is not your dinner this is my deliverer this is a deliverer for the people of God think about it and then then the little baby would float down float down float down toward Pharaoh's house and a little Whirlpool would catch that baby and it might begin to spin around like it was going down and an angel of the Lord would come with a finger and push somebody said I just don't know if I can get a hold of that or not you don't understand the times you don't understand the times that the angels of the Lord have fought for you and your babies mamas [Music] mothers I I've thought of this many times I've thought about Hawk his mother Freda here today Hawk was not raised a Christian but raised by a loving mother I want you to know that goes a long way he got into trouble he gives his testimony it's not mine to give but he has told me things about himself that I don't believe he's told me that I was more full of hate than anybody I knew and I was angrier than anybody I knew that's what he thought about himself but I want you to know from the time that Miss Frida had hawk in her belly he was a seed of God he had a destiny to perform come on and I want you to know the drugs couldn't get it see for Moses it was the crocodiles that couldn't get him it was the whirlpools it couldn't get him for Hawk it was the drugs that couldn't kill him the fights couldn't kill him the poison that he was taking into his life couldn't kill him because there was an angel of the Lord that was fighting for his destiny come on now we could go all the way around this room and say mama can only do so much mothers can only do their part but it takes the army of the Heavenly Host to watch over these children to guard their destinies oh yes it takes a village sometime a spiritual Village not a worldly Village but a spiritual Community to help guard the Suri baharendama foreign the seeds of Destiny jacoved was a mother with a plan you're not no no no no no no no no no no Pharaoh's not going to have him no no no no no no the crocodile's not gonna have him the whirlpool is not going to drown him he's a goodly child with a huge Destiny ahead and I want you to know she was praying she put some legs on her prayers she sent her little daughter to run down chase that that basket I want you to watch where it goes oh can you imagine Miriam's Delight can you imagine her Delight when she saw that little basket float right up to the bathing pool of the daughter of pharaoh there are these beautiful Maids are out there in there in their you know lotus flowers are floating around I don't have time to be dramatic and but it's just a beautiful scene these beautiful maidens are around bathing in the water and Pharaoh's daughter maybe just standing there on the side I don't know exactly what the scenario was but all of a sudden this the spirit of the Lord the hand of the Lord the angel of the Lord just allowed that basket to float right in there and they took that little basket up and and oh she recognized you said this must be one of the Hebrew babies but God somehow put a love in her heart may I say to you today you don't have to be the biological mother of a child to love that child fiercely we have examples of that in our church community she drew that child up they named him Moshe being drawn up from the water and she said I must find a wet nurse among the Hebrew people perhaps that would would feed this little baby in Miriam's in the in the pecan through the papers you know and she's dares can you imagine the fear she's spying on Pharaoh's daughter and she speaks up and says across the ranch there she speaks up and says I know just the one this was not a coincidence this was not happenstance that little mother that had peeled that little child off of her nursing breast now gets to have him back for a little while longer she's called to the palace and she nurses her own child and continues to talk to him don't cry Moses you're a deliverer let Mama whip your slobber one of these days God's Gonna use your mumbling tongue to deliver his people come on that's a Mama that is a mother someone who refuses to look at circumstances and the environment maybe maybe a young mother here today could say well I don't know whether I'd really want to bring a baby into this world or not the question is not what you would desire the question is what God would desire and I want you to know if there's yet a seed to be expressed in the earth one of God's foreign own elected and predestinated why don't you why not you you let your faith continue to reach up to him and believe that all of his goodness is all around us his promises are yea and amen there was a mama now in a message why Christ speak paragraph 61 I've got to hurry God had called him from his birth put qualities in him of great faith and then come down with his presence and anointed that great something in him and sent him down with his word and he was a properly a Vindicated of his claims no matter how many quacks had raised up how many of these other things that happened God was speaking Moses was identified Moses what Moses said God honored I want you to never forget that word what Moses said because God's word was in Moses I'll be with your mouth it'll speak the right things now what God says he speaks it through Moses and it confirmed and Vindicated his claims also he was told by his mother of his mysterious birth and how that the time of hand come close to the hour that there was to be a deliverance amram and yogavid the Sons and Daughters of Levi began to pray to God to send the deliverer he was an answer to his own mother and Daddy's prayers take when you see the time of Promise drawing now sets people to praying and hunger and no doubt that your covet had told him many times his mother as she was his tutor also we know the story and had told him how that she had prayed in Moses when you were born son you were a proper child you were different there was something taking place at your birth see she's pouring into him brother Adam said I gave a drama on it for the children not long ago and and said while amraham was in the room praying he saw an angel pull his sword and point it toward the North and said you'll have a child and he'll take the children North to the promised land given a drama for the little fellas so they'd understand it uh that their intellect hasn't come up to the place that you adults and can grasp the things his holy spirit reveals it to you now though his mother had told him these things that he knowed this yet he needed another touch the teaching was fine but he needed a personal contact he needed his own experience now mama you can't do that God don't have any grandchildren are you with me today you can tell them over and over and over and over again what God's got for them but you can't make them be what God called him to be that's when you have to put them in your little basket and say now God they're yours I'm floating you in the river I don't know I don't know between now and then but I know that at the end of the end I know there's coming a Time I say that to you mothers and dads who have children who have gone astray they're no longer in your care you no longer have the biggest voice in their life but it doesn't mean that you have given up and it doesn't mean that God isn't on the case amen and God knows how to bring them right back to him he knows how to draw them back to himself and he knows how to fulfill every word that was ever spoken to you about their destiny he said that's what the world needs today that's what the church needs today that's what everyone needs Sons and Daughters of God in order to be that you need a personal contact see something no matter you know the word is true you know it's right but then when it contacts I could go back to Hawke's testimony If I Had the Time because he didn't even know what there was until God reached down then and put his finger on that seed made contact with his life how about you do you remember when God made contact with your life it's the most valuable thing that could ever happen to you when God puts his finger on your heart you see the thing done then you know you're on the right Road see and watch it'll always be scriptural it'll stand right with scripture because this did no matter let's go on was that the end of that one all right I I think there's one more a true sign that's overlooked just a short little paragraph there and so when amram and yokovid saw that it was time for the word to be fulfilled they went to prayer to God and it's usually those who pray is the one who's got the burden the one who gets something the one who prays the one who's got the burden is usually the one that gets something if anybody can testify of that same man it's those who pray that's ordained of God to do so then there was another anointed fiercely faithful woman of God that's in my heart her name was Deborah in Hebrew devorah I want you to see if you can picture her riding a horse she's riding out to battle like Joan of Arc he's leading 10 000 soldiers into the field she's waiting to hear God's voice she's realized that unless the leaders of her Nation act the Hebrew people are about to be annihilated it didn't matter how many times God had spared the Hebrew people before it was another day and another hour and another circumstances and what was needed was for the leaders of the nation to do something and when they wouldn't do something guess what God did he raised up a fiercely faithful anointed woman of God who said I'd rather you do it I'd rather you do it I'd rather you get the credit but if you won't move I'm going to move I don't believe in women pastors I don't believe the Bible the authority of the Bible is behind a woman pastor even a woman preaching to men I don't believe that that is the order that God has initiated but I want to tell you something this message is in the hands of hundreds of thousands of people not because of preachers but because of women foreign she didn't have to preach she didn't have to fill the pulpit she didn't have to block the baptistry picture all she had to do was witness at the wash line all she had to do was tell those that she came in contact with here I got a little booklet here but you like to would you like to re I've got a I've got a favorite preacher here on a cassette tape would you like to hear would you would you like to borrow this uh preacher has set my world on fire and I just wonder if you'd like to have it I only got one copy but I'm willing you got to let them know how precious it is you don't walk up to somebody say I know you're never going to listen to this you tell them this is all I got and I'd like to have it back if you don't want it it's precious to me but I love you and I'd like to share this with you hello and it went it went to the watering holes they gathered around rivers in Africa with no cassette players what you gonna do then what's a woman going to do when there's no cassette player to share a tape with her neighbor she's going to have to tell it it would have been more biblically appropriate if the woman at the well would have had a tape player and a tape she could have taken that from house to house in the town and said here I'd like to play you a sermon of a prayer but there was no need no time for that no technology for that so guess what she did Mahalia Jackson said it best she went running running running running she said the people why because she was fiercely anointed fiercely faithful and anointed and she told everybody come see that's not a woman Pastor hello that's not a woman preacher that's not a woman not being submissive that's a woman not waiting on her husband to witness the truth you can't tell what he did for your husband but you can tell what he did for you you don't have to do it in a preacher voice you don't have to say glory to God hallelujah thank you Jesus ah you don't have to do it Pentecostal Style you don't have to spit and sputter you can just share you better tell somebody you better tell somebody you better tell somebody woman of God you better share your life you better share your light you better watch your witness at Walmart you better watch your witness in your automobile you better watch your witness in your neighborhood because you are called to be fiercely faithful and anointed in this hour you don't have to be a pastor or an unsubmissive woman to do those things you're anointed to do those things you are called to do those things somebody said I I want my husband to be the priest of the home that's God's biblical order but don't you sit around and wait on him and let the TV raise your children while you're waiting on Bible order to fall you tell your children you raise your children you show your children come on now brother random said there's five Gospels Matthew Mark Luke John and mother you read it you share it you tell them you'll be the example and you don't have to usurp any authority to do it it's your responsibility their bone of your bone and flesh of your flesh and God gave them to you and you are partially responsible for their life a judge a I believe A Woman's Place as a mother is at home with her children I believe that's God's order it's not always 100 feasible it's more feasible today than it's ever been because there are so many opportunities that a woman can work from home somebody said how could that be according to the Bible did you read Proverbs I left out some verses there go back and read them the Proverbs 31 Woman is a is a woman who has a business I only love to preach that because I know how women get whipped I know how in so many places they get a whipping for being creative I know in so many places how they get kind of talked down to because they have a desire to help make a dollar or two for their home if you can't do it and raise your children and give them your attention I don't suggest it but how many of you know there comes a time when your children are in a place you've got one or they're getting old enough and you've got a desire you don't need 40 hours not with children at home but I don't I tell you what I like what my wife has done for our family as an entrepreneur and I don't trust her with real estate like the Bible said buying land and selling land that I've never seen but my money come on but I don't mind her doing the things that she does she she doesn't make a tremendous amount of income these days but she makes a substantial amount to take care of the supplements and oils that we use our children haven't suffered because of it she has been used in Ministry because of it it's quiet so I just wanted you to know that the the Proverbs woman The Virtuous Woman of the Bible was not one who just stayed around in darn socks she was one who had some ambition and desire not to climb corporate ladder and forsaker children not to make her husband cook his own supper listen your husband shouldn't have to come home and cook his own supper no sir he shouldn't you've got to figure a way when you're able you do plenty of cooking when you're able to do it you do all you can cook from Sun up till sun down buy you a freezer and freeze it because there will be times that you may not be able to do everything that you would like to do but a woman who's resourceful like the like the virtuous woman that's described there in Solomon's writings she finds a way maybe I should I read it I'll trust you to do the homework so be careful be careful folks how you judge somebody else's home because yours ain't running perhaps the way you'd like for it to run [Music] the Bible doesn't tell us that she ever had children of her own we don't know but the Bible calls her a mother anybody with me did you know you can be a mother with no children according to the Bible you can she was a judge she was a prophetess she was a warrior a soldier a leader in battle she was a woman of prayer she was wise she was Discerning she was Brave she was beautiful and she credited other women with helping to win the battle we don't know if she ever gave birth to a child of her own but Judges chapter 5 verse 7 says this this is uh I I what I gave you was the complete Jewish Bible I just didn't put cjb but if you could if you are you able to pull that because the King James changes the the uh pronoun and no other translation does that so I looked at all the other translations King James makes it sound like Deborah singing about herself and I knew some people have a problem with that so I started looking into the pronouns in the original and found out that the King James is the only one that says I the complete Jewish Bible and Amplified and New American Standard and many others say more like this the ruler ceased in Israel they ceased until you arose Deborah devorah a rose a mother in Israel you know what that basically says it's it's like the hour we're living in right now let me sing you a little song our leaders have fallen asleep they need a pill to sleep and appeal to wake up and appeal to get through the day and we can't depend on them anymore and I don't know if we're going to have any better choices in the next election [Music] because we're not where we were six years ago what we need is a devorah ah what we need is a mother in Israel we need some Fierce fiercely faithful and anointed women of God to get on their prayer bones and call on the god of Israel because he's the only hope we have that's it that's what they were singing there when our leaders had failed us God God raised up a man like Barack God raised up a woman like devorah a mother in Israel she may have never had children from her own womb a mother the nation hello she mothered a nation in a season when nation needed a mother I want you to know we need mothers hello in this day spiritual mamas mothers in Zion spiritual midwives mothers in the nation who will call on the Lord in in in the message if God be with us then where are all the Miracles whether Bradham says in paragraph 33 and this place here we just left a few years before this had been the prophetess Deborah and Barack brother Branham calls her a prophetess Bible calls her a judge and a prophetess and so much more and how that she had prophesied and told them what to do and it was just exactly right Barack the great warrior how that they made us strong of the triumph over the enemy it took a warrior like Barack and a mother in Israel like devorah to get the job done I want to tell you something if we are ever to fulfill the commission that God has placed on this church and on this community we're going to need baracks to rise up come on we're going to need men who will not be wishy-washy in the time of the battle hello we're going to need men who will not let their attitude keep them from doing what God would have them to do we're going to need men to raise up like Barack to war in the spirit let me bring this to proper balance we need mothers in Israel you don't have to be old to be one we need women who'll pray we need women who won't wait on somebody to tell them how to pray they'll let the Holy Spirit tell them how to pray they'll call on the Lord if this church is ever going to be what God has called us to be in the last days with a Pulpit to the Nations we're going to need every faithful fiercely faithful anointed woman of God regardless of your age to raise up and receive the commission of Prayer it'll take every one of you doing everything you can to help pray the promises of God into reality in this hour but here's the brutal truth you can have a church full of mothers in Israel praying on the prayer Watch and it will not carry the authority of one man of God somebody said I wished you hadn't said that I wished I didn't have to say that but it's not my order it's Bible order if somebody said does that devalue women if you took it that way you miss my heart I am very quick to tell you we are not here today because of men we are still here today because of women who have prayed who have sacrificed fasted for my life when I was so sick until their hair fell out by the handful fasting for me it was many many many sisters together holding on pushing through listen coming to church when their husbands stayed at home so yes I see the value that's what I'm here to preach about but one man you let one man surrender [Music] so here's how we handle the truth that I've just told you here's what you sisters need to be praying for you need to pray for the men of God to rise up in this hour come on now by saying Lord we need man to raise up with Integrity in this hour we need men who will fiercely fight for their children in this hour I said to my grandmother you remember all those places that we went looking for the spirit and power of Elijah I found him I found the one that we were looking for she said his name wouldn't happen to be William Branham would he said of course it is how did you know and she'd give me the testimony if you heard the second podcast you heard me giving the testimony of how she came to hear and how she was confused by the gift that she saw operating so rather than to speak one word against it she put it away until the right hour and I said to my granny who had ministered since 1950 and I said if that if that is the Elijah Prophet if that is a prophet that has the spirit and power of Elijah when he said thus saith the Lord and we take that back to the word and it lines up we're going to have to do what he said big mama wouldn't you say so she said yes honey we're going to have to do what he said and I said big mama brother Branham said according to the word women don't Pastor churches and they Don't Preach to men folks nobody loved their granny any more than I loved mine nobody respected their grandmother any more than I respected mine and feared her to a certain extent and I had had this discussion with her many times before but when that inspiration struck her heart of what I said all the years of arguing with me ain't no man I can tell you I can sound like her if you want me to ain't no man gonna tell me that God didn't call me but not this time she had a rough life my grandfather was a was a womanizer and when I was born he was living in the valley with another woman and in my files he was the supervisor at the Mill in Columbus where the where you girls have had your wedding receptions he was a supervisor in that meal and he was driving every day to the valley to live with a woman and drive him from the valley all the way to work and on occasion stopping by my grandmother's home where the family was and getting more clean clothes now I had an aunt married to my grandfather's brother who washed his clothes and packed his suitcase every weekend for him to go live with a woman but my granny said I'm drawing the line he said I I'm going to respect you and honor you you've always got a place at this table you've always got a bed here you're my husband I'm going to honor you but I am not going to wash your clothes to go sleep with somebody else on the weekend so she said you let her you let honey he called her honey you let honey wash your clothes I have the letter back there I'm not through I know where I am I have the letter back there that my mother wrote to my grandfather and said Mr Ralph you've got to meet your grandson he looks just like the shellies you've got to see him I know you're choosing another life right now but you've got a place in our lives and we miss you and we need you and we want you to come home and we want you to forget about that woman and come home to your wife into your children and your grandson and all the begging that had gone on for months and months and months didn't do any good but when that letter arrived in the valley he kept it and my and when he come home he brought it and handed it to my grandmother and she kept it and gave it to me when I was grown I'm telling you God knew what he was doing so she had a rough life she in that in that time period she would get had to get in an automobile she was pastoring a church before just before that in uh Blue Springs Alabama about 70 miles from here she herself was working in the cotton mill and was driving all the way down there to Pastor a church and all the way home and in him up in the valley living with a woman it was hard things were hard but she fought and if anybody'd say to her why don't you just quit she'd say you didn't call me man didn't call me God called me I'm going to serve him I'm going to do everything I can for him all the days of my life I was I was ready to get the whole story that day again I could have just said wait a minute granny I know what you're going to say but I'm glad I didn't because this time I said if that was the prophet with the spirit and power of Elijah we're going to have to do what he said to be right with God she said that's right then I told her what he said she hung her head and she said well and I thought she was getting a breath to blast me out of the living room she said well you mean to tell me I've done that all these years and it wasn't even my responsibility I said that's exactly right granny God honored everything you did in his name and he will reward you for your faithfulness to what you thought was the right thing but it was not your responsibility and she looked at me and said then I'll never do it again how could she do because her heart was right her Doctrine was wrong but her heart was right and when truth struck it's that inspiration struck her and she said then that is not my responsibility I want you to know something it's not your responsibility as a sister to fill this Pulpit but it is your responsibility to share this life share it wherever you go even even those of you I don't want to call names but I will sister Alfreda never married never had children of her own but has raised many I couldn't say and salute her but you see she has on a corsage this morning because somebody honors somebody sees that you don't have to be a biological mother to be a mother in Israel hello hello and you don't have to be a man to be the witness of the truth that God has made real to you you don't have to do it by handling the word all you have to do is say come see a man who told me everything that I'd ever done change my life my life and love me and my sin come on how many of you are glad that there's a place there's a place I've got to hurry I'm worn out and I hadn't even preached the Widow of Zarephath she was fiercely faithful and anointed she was Scavenging to make a fire for her dying son this starving woman encounters a stranger who appeared as though he hadn't missed a meal I don't think the prophet looked emaciated I think he was getting all the biscuits that had been handed to him but times were rough now and he was looking for something he needed to be sustained and his Supernatural meal had run out and God said go up to Zarephath or I've commanded a woman there to sustain you it wasn't so much that the prophet needed another meal it's that the woman was going to need another meal and so was her son so she's Scavenging around trying to make a fire for her dying son a starving woman encounters a prophet who asked her for food and although there is none despair she wants to give her son the attention and food he deserves she somehow finds resources to make a meal you know how the story goes I don't want to take the time to read it but you know how the story goes go on now and dress the meal make a cake she starts to walk away I'm just going to make this little meal and my son and I are going to eat and die we'll go right ahead and go make a little meal and As She's Walking Away what does he say just make me a little cake first the audacity the nerve can you imagine the woman has just told the prophet we're going to eat a little meal and die cause there is no more food and the preacher barely says he's sorry for you know he just kind of nods his head make me a little cake first you know everybody feels like preachers are fat and mostly lazy that must have been the thought in the day nevertheless she has very little to lose and most everything to gain she's fiercely faithful and she must have been anointed I want to read paragraph 35. through 41 in the reaction to an action Chicago Ohio read along with me in your mind and it was just a little bit just a little bit but it was all she needed God let this sink deep in the people's heart you may be down to your last handful I've heard people say I don't have much faith brother Branham I've also heard people say my faith is almost exhausted but what you've got if it's real faith here's how to get it to do something you take that little bit of faith that you've got left and you mix it with God's word hello I haven't mentioned it from the pulpit here I was going to the Sunday that it was announced because we've we felt so blessed that sister Heather and brother Dwayne Jackson called our house got on the phone last week wanted to tell us on the speakerphone we celebrated with them over the birth of Liam they had tried before couldn't have children they went for treatments and it failed and were unable to have children someone stepped forward and although there were many things against them someone stepped forward and said they would be willing to help pay or them to try again I'm sure there was fear in their hearts but they stepped out in faith we were so blessed to get reports all along the way I remember hearing that they that the eggs were viable hearing that they were fertilized and viable I remember getting the report how many male and how many female eggs were still viable they kept us updated all all along the way but because they had tried before and things had failed that heaviness still hangs in the air and she must have felt it the entire time that she was pregnant that battle between faith and a little fear come on God bless them I I'll still remember the day I remember getting the good news I remember him standing here and holding little baby Liam this church just worshiping with them and rejoicing with them and celebrating with them believing that they had exhausted now their only hope of having a child of their own after adopting two children and then the Call Comes last week before last now I guess are you sitting down said to Sister State brother Steve in the room could we get on here together they want to know if the kids were there they were not well I've been to the doctor today and I'm expecting a baby now the first time was a miracle a miracle that they were able to carry that she was able to carry it a miracle that all the you ought to know the hoops shots every day the routine that you have to go through to try to help your body stay in the in the in the right place to carry it it's a miracle man couldn't get the credit for that we could only give the credit to God and we did and people celebrated nobody nobody said well you know you know nobody said that they all thank you Lord you have been so faithful to them every preacher in the country took credit for praying the prayer and they let them all think they did that's the way they are they LED every one of us celebrate our little part she had it all memorized they had it all memorized you remember that service when you said so and so remember when brother so-and-so prayed remember when they looked at me and said such and they had it all memorized but they were not really expecting her words were it was a surprise not really sure how it happened I made a joke but now we're expecting a baby I remember Brent and Trish hesbrick how bad they wanted to have a little child and how they were believing God and how they were prayed for and how we had an opportunity to pray and I remember [Music] the attitude that sister Trish had and the attitude that Heather sister Heather had toward all these other mothers all these other friends of theirs who were getting pregnant and having babies it's so easy to let that build up in your heart in the grief and and the and the and and all that goes on I'm not a woman I I can only imagine in my mind what that would feel like but here's what impressed me with those women and I've seen it in this room I've seen this kind of an attitude in this church you don't withdraw and you don't get this thing God don't love me like he loves everybody else if you let that build up in your heart you'll never have a promise fulfilled in your life no no no no no no no no no no you be the first to buy the blanket many times have I am I going to have to buy I don't know how many births you're going to have to celebrate but here is one thing I know God is faithful to his word so here's what I would do because I wanted to address every situation I know that there are women who have grieved the loss of miscarriages I know there are those who are not natural mothers but mothers in Zion I know there are those today who have adopted children I know there are those who have lost their mother and so mothers they can't be quite as bright as it used to be I know there are also some of you who have to look really hard to find something to honor in your mother because your life wasn't just like the one sitting next to you that's reality may not be your reality but it's somebody's reality I wanted to think about all the women who wanted to be mothers and have not yet had that opportunity and I also wanted to honor all the mama bears that are men because not only can women be passionately fear fearlessly aggressive in guarding and protecting their cubs sometimes daddies have to be the same way hello so I wanted to leave the service today having mentioned all as many as I could think of the different things that might be running through a woman's mind in a service like this we once had a mother in our church in Columbus who was so grieving for him for a miscarriage that she wanted us to move the bathroom so that she didn't have to pass through the the nursery to get to the bathroom in the church in Columbus and I had to say to her and all the love I could muster as a young boy young Pastor it would be easier for me to pray the Lord's healing on your hurt and deliverance that you obviously need to carry than it would be to move the plumbing so come here let me pray for you that's how she got her help so I wanted to be mindful of all the different categories and thought but I also wanted to remember there was this woman here who had a child a healthy child and could no longer provide for this child and things were about to get very very bleak heard the word of the Lord and she did something about it so this is where I would like to offer my advice to anyone hearing this sermon who desires to be a mother and has not yet had the blessing to do that here's two things I would like to recommend if you have never heard them I recommend you doing what these sisters have done that I just mentioned that you celebrate every baby born to every friend that's in your life you celebrate if it's painful and it is do it anyway because God sees that heart that is the heart of a mother when there was famine and two women argued about whether or not this baby was theirs one mother said slice him in half you take your half I'll take a half and the other woman spoke up and said no no no no no you raise him he's yours Solomon didn't even have to be a wise man it was most obvious who carried the heart of a mother the one who said I'd Rather somebody else raise my child then for me to see his death hello so by celebrating the miracle in everybody else's life you are demonstrating and you should be celebrated for such you are celebrating the blessing of God in somebody else's life and demonstrating the heart of a true mother and I have another piece of advice if you're blessed enough to be anywhere near a prophet and you think he's thirsty you be the first put a cup of water in his hand we are without a word prophet in our day we couldn't get to brother Branham but there are five full prophets in the land and I would never want that Prophet to be thirsty if I had an opportunity to do something for that man I would do it and I would do it not unto him but unto the Lord and I believe those two things according to the scripture unlock a blessing you showing the True Heart of a mother guess what Solomon said oh no no no no no no we're not cutting him up we're going to give him to you I know who the real mother is that wasn't a gift particularly that was a very obvious demonstration of a mother's heart you let that be a part of who you are and see if God won't bless he will he will he will keep his word if you believe that same man not in my timing in his timing so you just keep holding on hold on because real mothers minister to others even in the midst of desperate circumstances here's what the woman of Zarephath did she made a cake let me read it I I I'm off out of order here a little bit so let me read it but what you've got it's if it's real Faith mix it with God's word look what it'll do you say well let me go on next next paragraph now get ready she stirred it up together that's the only thing between her and death that may be the only thing left for you tonight between you and death is what little spirit that you can muster up in your heart to believe it mix it you're hearing him my faith is almost gone I'm going to make my little meal and we're going to eat it and die mix it with God's Eternal Word when she did I can see her pull the little racket curtain back and look in the little boy's holding his little stomach mother mother are you ready to cook that little cake said Yes dear just wait a few minutes mother's mixing it up mother break it in two and you take half of it oh honey we'll take care of that what was it now the word the meal and the oil the spirit the oil mixed together she went out into the yard to get did you notice scripture says two sticks the cross always good hundreds or woodsmen know that the way to keep a fire burning is lighted in the middle two logs laid across and lighted all through the night you can keep pushing the ends as it burns and right in the center of the Cross is where the sacrifice of God hung she went into the yard she picked up two sticks she looked up the hot blistering winds not a leaf on the tree no grass in the yard where the old tree Once stood just two sticks left she picked them up to go in to make it it was famine what is it when self-sacrifice when you have mixed the word with the spirit or the spirit with the word and then ready to sacrifice yourself at the cross and you're ready to say whether I live or die is anybody listening whether I live or die Lord I've done everything I know how to do and I'm coming at the peak of Mercy sacrifice my own believing I'll not think of it anymore I'll not reason it anymore I'm casting off reasonings I'll just believe it Lord because it's your meal and oil your spirit your word your truth I'm throwing myself as a sacrifice on the cross that's what it was speaking of she picked up the two sticks to go in for the sacrifice when all this is completed God's a very present help in the time of trouble they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings like an eagle they'll run and not be weary they'll walk and not faint teach me Lord teach me Lord how to wait they that wait don't be weary is anybody with me if you've got the word and the spirit sacrifice your own belief laid it on the cross read it started walking back at about that time she heard a voice and as she turned to look there was kind of a look oh she said would you fetch me just a little drink of water maybe on her lip she was ready to say I'm both ends of the line God had showed Elijah Vision go down in the city for I've commanded not the Ravens this time to feed you but I've commanded a widow woman to sustain you and took him to the poorest of the Poor's I've commanded a widow woman to sustain you and she didn't even have enough meal in the barrel for her and her son to live that day but I've commanded I've ordained it blessed be the name of the Lord when God ordains anything it's got to happen it'll be there God will meet it hello God will meet it what is an amen it's the power of agreement I'm agreeing with that word when God ordains anything it's got to happen it'll be there God will meet it I've commanded a winner there to take care of you to sustain you he gave him a vision I can see him walking down the street the Lord must have told him there'd be an old woman looking old she's young her shoulder stooped her shoulders ragged her arms are out of her sleeve she'd be out in the yard with two sticks in her hand and Elijah you know what that means we'll be in about 800 years from now what will be in about 800 years from now and as he walked he seen the woman he leaned over the little fence and said fetch me a little drink of water she turned to say something and she thought that's a kind old man he speaks a little different from the ordinary man there's something about God's children that they know one another something that's always been they know one another my sheep know my voice said Jesus then she looked and she heard she looked at him she said there must be something Godly about that old man said fetch me a little drink of water she nodded her head she would do it as she started to go away what she heard the voice again and bring me in your hand a little cake for me to eat a morsel of bread and she said I have just enough for me and my little starving boy and I'm out here Gathering these two sticks I've just mixed together dressed it and now I've got two sticks to make a fire to make a cake and he and I will eat it and die nothing could sound more hopeless than that be more desperate than that than exaggerating there were there were lamps there Washington government assistance this was her last meal then she heard she started to turn again but bring me one first what do we learn here this is a lesson seek ye first are you good for a few more minutes seek you first the kingdom of God and his righteousness read it all these other things come on but bring me one first look she didn't have to go down and get her last penny she had to go down and get her last piece of bread she didn't have to go for this or that or maybe change doctors or some little insignificant thing she had to go to the only thing that stood between her and death and her child bring me a little cake first in your hand I can see her not her head obedient that's what God requires folks here's the key here's the key no no no she could have said I'm going to eat my little bit my son's going to eat his little bit you eat whatever's left I'm obligated as a mother to my son first hello there's a lot of things she could have said when God's Prophet says a certain thing do it hold on to it she bowed her head yes sir she starts on then she heard the Swedish thing she'd ever heard that all-sufficient word that all of us listen for for their come across that gate a blast from that prophet's voice say it for thus saith the Lord amen that's what we look to hear thus saith the Lord the barrel will not go empty or the crews fail until the day that God sends rain on the earth there it was amen settled it I'm not going to argue with you over how God did it but I know how I think he did it I don't believe that she went to that meal Barrel the next time and found it full I don't believe she went to the cruise of oil the next time and found it full I believe that every time she went to the barrel there was just enough meal to make a cake however many cakes were necessary just enough oil to make however many cakes were necessary and then it looked like there was no more but she never had to worry again because God said it'll never be empty again so the next time she go she didn't have to be I wonder how many times she peeked probably a time or two she was human now well it's there how many of you believe after a while she didn't have to peek anymore it's not that she was a mother that makes her so great that was great but it said she was fiercely faithful and anointed and obedient as a woman of God and look how things changed then there was a syrophoenician woman I don't have time like I said I couldn't get nothing and then I got it all at one time real mothers are courageous and letting their children step confidently into their future I'm going to skip reading all the verses and I'm going to read the message desperations Hannah paragraph 98 Hannah you still with me Han I know you want to celebrate with your mother you can in a minute or two Hannah a barren woman in the Bible she wanted a son she got the fasting for him and she fasted and prayed until even the priest at the temple thought she was drunk she was in such desperation the Bible said she had cried out until her lips were moving trembling but no words were coming out she had prayed herself into a place of intercession where her lips were stammering she had stammering lips and even the priest of the most high God didn't know what was going on isn't that about how it is today some little sister in the church get under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and the first thing they think is a strange Spirit has got on her instead of thinking maybe the Holy Ghost is doing for her what he did for Hannah isn't that a sad shame What a Sad reality that it's easier for people to believe it's the devil what's wrong with the church than it is to believe it's God she was in so much desperation I know I've been so long I'm so sorry I'm not usually sorry but I'm sorry today I'm sorry I've been so long with the rest of the women watching what kind of a bonnet the other one had War that'd be like a sister one of your sisters feeling sorry for yourself because you didn't have on a corsage today and nobody gave you a croissant or something you letting that keep you from getting something from the Lord why that flower don't make you anything hello the word of the Lord is honoring you today your family might might look over you your family might forget your family might not follow that tradition don't you let nothing get in your mind like that we're talking about fiercely faithful and anointed women the tradition of my childhood was that every mother wore a corsage to church on its own Mother's Day as she bought it for herself that's how I grew up if nobody bought her once you bought one for sale she knew her husband you know your husband by now if you particularly wanted one you could have got it hello always quiet in here now I've uncovered so many things and let me tell you something a mother that's taking care of children she don't have no room for that flower anyway she's too busy juggling around when I was a boy not only did mothers wear them but every man in the church wore them every man in the church wore a boutonniere not a corsage they wore a flower one flower on their coat and they did it to honor their mother that is no longer the tradition so what don't let something like that get in your mind the word of God is honoring you now the house of the Lord is telling you who you are hello she was in such desperation the rest of the women were watching what kind of a bonnet the other one wore you know how it go let's see who got a new dress let's see who didn't get a new dress for Mother's Day what in the world is such a thing as that matter anyway wait a minute amen amen [Music] my wife hands on a new dress but she's had it for two or three months you just finally wore it it wasn't bought for Mother's Day she could have gone to her closet and picked one out and it would look new because if you've got several you'll just bring them out and the husband brags on them all again like he's never seen them before hello the other one's seeing what kind of clothes they had on talking about things going on the farm but not Hannah she didn't have time to worry about who had on a corsage she didn't have time to worry about who had a Noob on it and if it was the right color and if it matched her shoes with the rest of the women watching on she was desperate with the rest of the women watching what kind of a bonnet the other one had worse you you know how it goes uh other ones seeing what kind of talking about the things going but not Hannah she stepped right through the whole crowd on her way to the altar somebody ought to help me now she'd been fasting she wanted her approach taken away what a difference it is today it's almost a reproach to have a child it was her approach in that day not to have one we're not living in that day and she got on her knees she never noticed the Dignity of the temple she never noticed a dignified priest as he walked out she was in such distress to her tears were rolling down her cheeks you may hear something in this I don't hear I do not hear a woman feeling sorry for herself I don't hear a woe is me attitude here I hear one who is desperate to get a hold of God's heart I hear one who knows what she wants and she's willing to get a hold of God the only one who can help her to get it oh Lord God give me a son maybe we ought to try praying that well we know we're going to love it boy or girl but Hannah had something in mind give me one who will serve the Lord give me a boy so that he can serve God and Minister unto the Lord and on behalf of the Lord this was her desire she could have had a girl she could have prayed Lord give me a baby she said Give Me A Sign give me a son and notice she wasn't selfish when God heard her and answered her prayer and gave her a son just look what she did I know it's late I didn't fall I thought it was being real calm then she gave her son back to God and because she was willing not to be selfish after God had answered her prayer look what he did he didn't just give her a son he gave her a prophet in Israel [Music] for so long an open Vision had been missing in the land she didn't just get a child she got a prophet she didn't just get a profit she got a a open eye vision Prophet she didn't just get an open-out Vision Prophet she got a prophet that the Bible said none of his words fell to the ground everything he prophesied came to pass just like God said it I would say that having a son like Samuel was worth the wait oh what an extra blessing he's just full of them those little extra things he gives let's go on not only a son but a prophet and there had been no open vision for many many years in Israel Samuel the first prophet for many years because a mother got desperate hello I want you to notice this he didn't say because a woman got desperate man her heart already testified that she was a mother before she gave birth and there are women like that Sometimes women like that will get their feelings hurt because we will say things in front of them forgetting about the fact that they're not a yet a natural mother because they carry motherhood they carry it it's a blessing it's not the ability to have a baby that I'm preaching about it's it's more spiritual than that that that ability to have a baby it's a natural thing I'm talking about something spiritual I'm talking about somebody who carries the nature of a nurturer to me there's nothing more Godly nothing more Godly than someone who carries the heart of a nurturer so even before she was a mother in the natural she was a mother who believed a mother got desperate that she could have no children and she was past the age of bearing probably 60 70 years old I don't know if that is is exactly how it was or not but here's how he's telling it because a couple of times he said she was bent over and but not that old she prayed with desperation she must have this child what was it God had spoke to her no doubt now that's what we need we need to hear from the Lord you can't be desperate till God speaks to you so you got to hear him today he said well I don't really have a word you do you're getting it right now if you didn't already have a word you've got it right now God's promises cannot fail you can't be desperate till God speaks to you oh Church rise men women children rise and Shake Yourself pitch your conscience wake yourself up in this hour we must be desperate or perish listen what he says there and notice this is the end of of 63 or or September of 63. seals have already come he said we must be desperate repaired there is coming forth something from the Lord I know it as thus saith the Lord there's coming forth something and we better get desperate it's between life and death now listen to this part right here this is what leaves preachers on different sides of the aisle just like politicians they failed to see this it'll pass through us and we won't see it brother Branham speaking about the bear vision the Silver Tip grisly Vision uses this language pass through me so we know the kind of language he's using when he says it'll pass through us it means we will miss what God has purposed we will miss it if we don't get desperate before the Lord it'll pass through us and we won't see it it doesn't mean it won't happen it means we won't see it hello because that she wasn't selfish she was given a prophet because let's let's get that quote again let me give you the word of the Lord because she wasn't selfish she was given a prophet because boys because she wasn't selfish she was given a prophet two more mothers one her name was Mary you can read it for yourself in Luke chapter 1 26-38 I'm only going to read verse 37 and 38. Luke 1 37 38. for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the handmaid of the Lord the angel of the Lord Gabriel has just come and told her you're going to have a baby without knowing a man or she might not have been very smart but she biologically knew how things worked this was impossible the prophet of the Old Testament said behold God will do a new thing something that has never been done before a virgin one who had never sexually known a man is about to have a baby it has never happened that way before how did it happen because the Holy Ghost overshadowed her let me read you this quote and be done in a minute lean not unto thine own understanding 178 the Virgin Mary when the angel Gabriel met her and told her she was going to have a baby without knowing a man phew never been she never leaned upon her own understanding that a woman couldn't have a baby without having a husband she didn't lean upon that behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy Word I want to say again I know what Eve did she did what she was created to do she was more obedient than some women are today I know what Eve did she did what she was created to do it did not catch God by surprise she received another seed into her womb and paid the price and you paid the price but there's another woman here seriously faithful and anointed of God her name is Mary and even though she would carry the stigma of a fornicator she was willing to let God do in her what he desired to do and she laid aside her human reasoning and she didn't say how am I going to do it and when will I do it and how is all this going to take place but rather she trusted the Lord let's go on the angel said the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee and that Holy thing will be born of thee shall be called The Son of God she said behold the handmaid of the Lord she didn't take her reasonings that it couldn't be done she just said behold the handmaid of the Lord real mothers sometimes that great personal expense Say Yes to God and because of their yes the world is transformed be a Mary in a world full of Eves be a Mary and now I'm closing with this there came a Time that judgment would fall on the household of Saul and in order for that to happen his sons were slain even the sons of his concubine whose name was risper the Bible tells us in second Samuel chapter 21 and I'm going to skip to read the right verse if I I don't even know if I put the right verse here just a moment yes verse 10 Samuel 21 10. and risk for the daughter of A.I took sackcloth and spread it for her upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until water dropped unto them out of heaven and suffered neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the Beast of the field by night and it was told David what risk for the daughter of AI the concubine of Saul had done and David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of jabesh Gilead which had stolen them from the streets of betsyon where the Philistines had hanged them when the Philistines had slain Saul in galboa how many of you remember the story seven sons of Saul hanging on the wall two of them the sons of rispah not a wife concubine what we might call today a kept woman not a prostitute she wasn't a prostitute she was a kept woman she lived in a place where she her needs were met and taken care of and she came in unto the king and bore him children certainly not the way we do things today but it was done that way then her sons had to die it was judgment on the household of Saul she knew that they were somehow paying a price for their own sins and the sins of their father and she could not necessarily defend them in their lifestyle but like any other mother she believed that they deserved a decent burial and she refused to allow the birds of the air and the Beast of the field to eat her boys I love it I love response there ought to be a little bit of respite in every one of us they disappoint you they don't always do the right thing they don't always show you the right love and the right respect you can't always be proud of their behavior sometimes they stray sometimes they get on drugs sometimes they swap lives have two or three marriages don't take care of their children like they should that's the reality that some others have had to deal with with their children but I want you to know it doesn't keep a fiercely faithful and anointed woman of God from doing everything she can to beat away every demon power every bird of the air every beast of the field that would come to devour her seed she wasn't just worried about dead bodies she was fighting for her seed she was couldn't been fighting for their life their life was over she was fighting for their legacy she was fighting for something that had been given to her and she refused to let what God had given to her be treated like food for the Bears like food for the vultures whoo so rispa she got a stick bigger than she was come on I preached this all over the world with a broom I don't have the energy to use a broom today but I preach it yeah come on Mama come on sister Annie show me how it's done that's how it's done somebody look at Annie that's how it's done that's exactly how it's done you just make up your mind you ain't getting mine you are not getting mine come on you dirty devil you're not getting my sons you're not getting my daughter's eye sir is there a fiercely faithful woman here is there a fiercely faithful anointed woman here somebody on a war [Music] [Applause] I saw April get up her son is sitting right here she knows she won't always be a little boy one day he'll be old enough to choose the world and she better not wait until then or get me a broom somebody out of the closet in there better not wait until they're grown and done until Satan's had his way with him to start beating back the shoot of a Hyundai deal of akaya Indiana I did it for my own mother I had to be a risper for my own mother when she served hell when she was drunk when she did the things of the world I had to beat back the darkness of hell for the Salvation of her soul and would do it again today because I loved her let me tell you something here's where spiritual midwives come in here's where a little woman lay down there down the hill didn't hardly know who she was but God was still using her in intercession not only for her own girls but for somebody else's girls that's how elfrida has so many visitations from the Lord them there below the hill without any natural children of Our Own she's having to be back the forces of hell oh shut up over somebody else's son off of somebody else's door off of somebody else's grandchild seven seven fiercely faithful and anointed women so forgive me if I don't spend a lot of time reading the quotes about a woman being the lowest down thing because I know how the devil takes that I was preaching about a fallen woman he's talking about a fallen woman said I'd rather see my wife drunk on the floor than to see her with a cigarette in her mouth that was brother branham's passion against that nicotine devil it was not his desire to see someone drunk because an overcomer doesn't drink an overcomer doesn't smoke an overcomer doesn't play around with pornography you're not overcoming you're not overcoming you're not overcoming if you're being overcome somebody said well how drunk do I have to get to be if you know you've had a problem you don't need more than a sip of communion wine because if you won't guard your life who'll guard it who will guard your life who will guard for you if you don't guard for yourself if you don't fight for yourself who will fight for you it is not your Children's Place to fight that battle I did for my mother because I loved her but it wasn't my responsibility I did it because I loved her you're the only one that can fight that thing come on come on come on come on come on so forgive me if I take a moment once a year to say to the women of this church I don't know where we would be without you I don't know where we would be without you sisters I don't know where we would be if you hadn't stood the test if you hadn't been faithful Against All Odds come on Edith help me Edith's helping me faithful Against All Odds faithful to pray when nobody else would pray faithful to push when nobody else would bush musicians are coming we are blessed of God we are blessed of God to have fiercely faithful and anointed women of God some of which happen to be mothers to every woman who has ever lost a baby my heart goes out to you it's part of your body it's part of your life it hurts and I hurt for you but God never makes a mistake for those of you who are still fighting and believing for a companion don't give up those of you who are believing for a baby don't give up keep fighting the good fight of faith try asking for a son don't give up to every woman who may have had a mother who was not a real example of motherhood thanks be to God you made it you made it anyhow there's one thing I'm sure of about your mother and I don't know her if she loved you to the capacity that she was capable of loving you too you came from her body she could not forget that Every Woman doesn't have the same capacity to love the way people need to be loved I'm sorry I'm so sorry I know that hurt was it Pleasant but look at you look where you are raising your children your grandchildren look at you you made it through may God bless and help the memory of your mother for every one of you that have lost your mother there's no way no words to describe it it can sometimes feel like the most lonely thing in all the world God was so good to me shortly after I was married my mother had cervical cancer I don't even know if you know that and she had surgery she had no other family but me I sat with her in the hospital for her surgery I went with her to every Cancer appointment and they believed that they had gotten it all I remember standing in the shower after being married just a short time and sobbing like a little baby boy and saying to the Lord you have been so good to me to give me a beautiful wonderful loving wife but I just can't lose my mama Lord please don't let me lose my mama now and I was with her some months later when the doctor said there is no sign left cervical cancer you don't have to have chemotherapy we have gotten it all God heard my prayer and he gave me my mother another 20 years how could I feel bad at him for taking her when she was no longer in her right mind but I miss the mother that I had when she was well so to all of you who have lost your mother I am so sorry it is pain it seems like other than a child or a spouse it seems like the hardest thing you go through but then I look at somebody like brother Greeley who's so blessed he didn't get to be with his mom today but at his age younger than me let me make sure you know he's so blessed to still have his Godly mother still setting an example she didn't get to have her sons today but she's got all five brother Greeley told me she has all five of her daughters with her today what a blessing I look around this room and I see tremendous tremendous women of God and tremendous mothers we are blessed the credit doesn't go to Womanhood the credit and the glory and the honor goes to God let's stand and give him praise let's give him praise you sing whatever's on your mind I've still got that in my mind I'll carry it home with me today your goodness I just see it how
