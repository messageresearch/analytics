[0:00] I got a feeling we're going to face
[0:02] something bad I got a feeling it's not
[0:04] going to turn out all
[0:06] right I got a feeling this is going
[0:08] downhill from
[0:10] [Music]
[0:12] here you ever had a feeling like that I
[0:15] got a feeling that I better do this I
[0:17] got a feeling that I better do that I
[0:20] wonder why we don't ever get a feeling
[0:22] to tell us to not have
[0:25] dessert we've got feelings to tell us
[0:27] everything else but very few to tell us
[0:31] you don't really need that especially
[0:34] that second piece those feelings are
[0:38] battling like a battling Ram against the
[0:43] word but the word always remains Rock
[0:48] Steady God's people are led by the
[0:51] spirit the sons of God are led by the
[0:56] spirit of God they're not led by feeling
[0:59] they're not not led by a shaky sensation
[1:02] they're not led by by anything other
[1:05] than the spirit of God which is the
[1:08] spirit of the word the word that lives
[1:12] your Bible is God in printed form that's
[1:17] powerful it's God in printed form but
[1:20] alone without the spirit the printed
[1:24] form of the word becomes a what a letter
[1:27] and the letter can kill but the
[1:30] quickening life that's on the word by
[1:32] Revelation brings stimulation doesn't it
[1:35] it brings something that quickens us and
[1:38] causes our faith to be anointed to move
[1:41] forward sometimes somebody will say you
[1:44] know how do I know what is the will of
[1:47] God and and sometimes counselor would
[1:50] say the first thing to you is do you
[1:53] have a desire well I need to tell you
[1:56] that's only part of the
[1:57] equation you may have a desire desire
[2:00] but that doesn't necessarily mean it's
[2:01] the will of
[2:03] God is it according to God's word you
[2:06] may have a desire for something but it
[2:07] may not be God's word for you amen so
[2:11] there's a little bit more involved uh he
[2:13] said desire without knowledge it's not
[2:17] good when you're waiting on the Lord
[2:20] It's You In the
[2:22] book it's you in the
[2:24] word and it's prayer and it's setting
[2:28] yourself apart and you're not running
[2:31] for entertainment but you've come to a
[2:34] place of desperation I want to tell you
[2:36] something if you think you can make
[2:38] yourself desperate you can't but he
[2:42] can he'll squeeze
[2:44] us you you know one day you could care
[2:48] less and the next day after he squeezes
[2:50] you you really feel a dedication to seek
[2:54] the Lord and to seek his face amen we
[2:57] cannot be a hasty people we can't be a
[3:00] people that make our decisions and then
[3:02] demand that God come help us out of the
[3:05] mess he might he may he's good he's
[3:09] merciful don't you think when you leave
[3:11] here tonight that God is Not merciful
[3:13] he's
[3:14] merciful he looks over sometimes our
[3:17] messes but the Bible does tell us there
[3:20] was a time that he also winked at
[3:23] ignorance but that's not the hour we're
[3:25] living in now in this hour He commands
[3:28] men everywhere to do what to repent to
[3:31] set their record straight so if you're
[3:34] going to want God in the future to come
[3:36] and help you on that job that you just
[3:39] had to
[3:41] have that business that you just had to
[3:44] start you better know you folks we
[3:48] better
[3:49] know that we're moving not only in the
[3:53] mind of God the will of God but also in
[3:55] the timing of the Lord
