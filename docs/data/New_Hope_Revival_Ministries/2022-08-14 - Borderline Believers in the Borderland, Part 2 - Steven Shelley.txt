were touched just let's just keep going off of that and get better and better it's nice to have hawk and mary beth and joseph and rebecca and esther back with us we really miss them we uh we want to go to the lord in prayer today if you have unspoken prayer requests by just the uplifting of the hand there's needs all over this building we want to pray for all of those who have tested positive and when something like that happens everybody wants to ask who has i i'll be totally honest with you i can't remember every person but god remembers them all lukiovic got a positive test i think today and his children have it and have tested and uh sister sharon and sister kathy and sister megan and and uh some others but god sees them and it's all right it's just all right we don't like it we don't want it but you know in our minds we think well there'll be 15 or 20 there this morning and then look god just he provides and he brings and draws and thank you all for being faithful and not being afraid the lord's going to get us through this there may be some more positives before we get out of it but that's okay he knows exactly what he is doing so let's remember all those remember brother greeley today he's probably preaching now uh for his dad in virginia that god will use him in a mighty way and that the needs will be met there as well let's pray for those who receive the baptism of the holy ghost here tuesday night that they will continue to press in into more and more and more of him because there's more to be had and i think that's all that for this morning i want to mention let's just sing that again brother nathan would you mind coming in praying [Music] no one else can touch my heart like you do i could search for all eternity long and fine there is none

god you alone are worthy you alone are worthy you alone are worthy lord hallelujah would you give the lord a handclap of praise again today bless him bless him hallelujah [Applause] you may be seated we have so much to thank god for even in the midst of sickness many out today because of fighting symptoms some have had a positive test some are just being cautious some are fighting different kinds of symptoms but you know sister megan she was the first one to reach out to let me know how she was feeling and she said i don't know what it is i don't know if it's the flu or what it is but she said i just want you to know that it was worth it it's worth it to have been in the service tuesday night you said whatever we have and that's the truth you know what god did for us in this house tuesday night is well worth any trial that we have to go through to pay a little price nathan doesn't know this because he i think he had already left and many of you who were streaming the service tuesday night when the streaming was cut off is when service really started god really began to move and nathan obeying the lord last sunday played a role it played a part in what he was what he was speaking out under inspiration right in the middle of the message sister jada heard that and it went deep down into her heart and she said i have got to be there tuesday night and of course brother shane working wasn't able to be here with them or to bring them but she made a decision and he supported that decision i'm so thankful it was just a surprise to us to look up and see her and the kids here tuesday night then later after the service or toward the end of the service she shared that and she reached out to tiffany and um about where they might be able to pitch a tent and uh tiffany's husband who is not a believer he said well i don't know any place like that a campground where they have like that around here but he said that wouldn't be safe anyway and so he agreed which i feel like was sort of supernatural in itself he's not he's not in church by by any means at all and uh there's a sacrifice involved for her to fight through to be here and uh so he agreed to let them spend the night there and then then on tuesday morning tiffany wasn't feeling well and she wanted sister jaya to know she wasn't feeling well not to discourage her from coming in fact she said no i want you to come i just want you to know that i'm really battling in my body so there were more than one thing that could have could have dissuaded her from being in the service tuesday night and yet she fought through when i was sharing with hawk uh these things on the on wednesday i think of this week through text he said you know it reminds me of how brother josh and his wife uh with radical obedience they're just meeting this morning for the first time but with radical obedience he jumped up and and moved his family and and has been greatly he didn't maybe you don't know this but greatly criticized for doing so but felt the urgency to obey and he obeyed he said that's the same kind of urgency that was on sister jada that made her radical obedience i've got to be there and even when it seemed like the service was over coming to an end and i'd already stepped down from the platform i looked over and i had missed zachary sitting there with his hands lifted up in the air and the lord was touching him and the next thing you know well anyway you that were here you know and i have i have said i know of four who have claimed that they have received the baptism of the holy ghost after the service tuesday night and there perhaps were more than that and uh even the spirit of the lord fell on amelia and she's six isn't she the spirit of the lord fell on her and she was so happy she said i'm so happy she said this was the first time i cried in church she was so thrilled and you know he was just pouring himself out and maya had been believing for the lord to do something for her she's claiming that she's one of those in that number that says he filled me with a holy ghost and she woke her granny up i don't know she was sleeping or not sister terry but she woke her up to call her and tell her what the lord had done for her so if you miss tuesday night we can't duplicate it no no video record of it but we pray that it'll happen again and again and again and again and again and again and again and we know that god this is how god has moved for us many times in the past he started moving on our children and our teenagers and our young people and we had a word from the lord here some sometime back i don't know exactly when it was but hawk mentioned it this morning in my office where the lord said don't be so quick to get out of here you should just tarry even as the service is ending and worship me i want to meet you and he said something like you know even after some have already gone home i i will and he's been faithful and i believe it's just the beginning we have so much to thank god for can you say man let me sing just a little something and we'll let these musicians go down and huh this is not working how do brand new microphones not work all right eagles i was standing on a mountain i was looking toward the sky when i saw that storm approaching and i feared that i would die saw god's creed run and seek a better place to hide heard the thunder roll in my soul then i bow my head and cry now the clouds were moving faster that lightning was splashing bright clouds so dark they hid the light of the sun till it seemed that it was nice all but all at once there was a feeling like i'd never had before [Music] above the storm you should have heard me sing god had given me egos [Music] wings will you sing it with me so spread your wings little eagle and fly you weren't born to live down in that valley oh you were born to soar through the sky don't let your trials bring you down or drive your spirits low to the ground mount up with wings [Music] little eagle and blind all at once his spirit left in me till i was high above it all [Music] you know i never even had to move my wings the holy spirit he had control now i was soaring high above my circumstances my confusion and all my pain and though i had spent many years in that old barnyard i was always an eagle [Music] bye his name sing with me spread your wings so spread your wings little eagles [Music] you weren't born to peck around in that old valley oh you were ordained to soar through the sky don't let your trials bring you down [Music] and fly sing the chorus one more time just bound up with wings oh little and you weren't born to live down in the valley oh you were elected you were born to soar through the sky don't let your trials bring you down or drive your spirit low to the ground mount up with wings little eagle and fly keep your eyes upon the sun [Music] the battle is nearly one mount up with wings little eagles [Music] oh yes yes we were born for that would you thank god for these musicians ashley served us so well we're very happy to have mayor bethel back with us in this service so good to have him so good to have hawk and este my bestie and and joseph and rebecca god is just good isn't he you better be seated just a moment um we want to continue to remember sister anita curry in prayer she stands in desperate need of the lord's help and today is her birthday so we want to ask the lord to meet her how many of you know he can reach right to where she is he can reach her and he can minister to her need and we want to lift her up to the lord in prayer and sister kathy her birthday is on friday of this week so we want to wish her a happy birthday as well and pray that she is feeling better much better by then and then on saturday of this coming week is our baby girl's birthday and she's certainly not a baby anymore she's going to be 16. it's really hard for me to believe that mariah is turning 16 next saturday which means benjamin has a birthday on sunday but we don't mention sunday birthdays just through saturday so would you just let's just wish all of them a happy birthday with a little recognition and pray for them [Applause] last sunday when i came to the pulpit i wanted to mention the reception that had been held on the border in washington state the border with canada for solomon and zion and i wanted to mention it uh for one real reason and that is that solomon's pastor brother john andes has been so kind to reach out to us on several occasions since the wedding and to say every time how blessed he was with the atmosphere and with the service for their wedding and how touched of god he was and he knew that we didn't get to be there with him that day to celebrate so he sent voice messages to me several that morning and i answered them right away and then he started sending pictures and video clips so that we could share a little bit of what was going on there and i i thought that was it was remarkable enough that i wanted to mention to you it's just real courtesy and real kindness of a fellow pastor to do something like that knowing that that our hearts are pretty tender about zion moving from here to another place although we want her certainly to be with her husband yes that's right we want that but i just thought it was exceptional that he would take the time to keep me posted and send pictures and updates and also i heard from him this week they were having a fair uh some kind of community fair several thousands i don't remember exactly how many i want to say up maybe close to 200 000 people would be coming through that fair i could have that off a little bit but they hit the church there set up a booth and they they made a nice display there and they made a a booklet from a from a pdf file that shares some of the outstanding testimonies that have been taking place around the world around the message of the hour and it was really impressive what they were doing i saw brother jason demars was there with them for this time and they're just you know it's a witnessing booth they're just set up out there in the public where people come to to buy knickknacks and vegetables i don't know what all they have an affair or a festival like that probably a lot of good food well i don't know that is uh anyway not not southern food but i'm sure it's delicious and uh people were coming and and hearing and standing there listening and different brothers and sisters in the church sharing the truth and providing information and literature that they could take it home you know i think that's just outstanding i wanted to mention that you never know that god might lay something like that on your heart and you might want to be a witness for the truth that god has sent to us i want you to know that it's it's important enough that we ought to want to tell it to somebody and if we don't know how to tell it we just ask god to give us grace and give us wisdom and leadership on how to share it because it needs to be shared how many of you can agree with that all right let's stand together and thank you for listening to all that i wanted to get that out last sunday and we were having so many problems with the stream and uh i mean way beyond even what you know and and uh hawk we we took what we had of the service and we uh he made sure that it was uploaded to sub splash which is our our app and which is our website and when the file was there rj saw it was gonna i think he was gonna do something with it for so that it would be on the app and there was nothing it wouldn't play so even after the fact the enemy was still fighting that and so now it is not it's still a processing so it's not available to watch right now but it's on the app so perhaps by the end of the day last sunday service will be up and we've had so many people who didn't get to see it because they didn't know that it was being streamed on someone's telephone here and so we want to announce to everyone streaming the service today that probably by the end of the day that service that you have asked about and i mean dozens of people have asked and may god just use it to continue to bless them and strengthen them this is our desire amen are you still here good glad to hear it would you turn in your bible this morning i would like for us to go to the book of numbers chapter 13. we're very mindful that there are people streaming this service today we bless every one of you in the name of the lord so many are watching already on youtube and the nations of the world and everywhere just everywhere god bless every one of you and also on facebook and the app we just bless every one of you in the name of the lord you're definitely an encouragement to us we appreciate you and the lord spake unto moses saying this is numbers 13 1 send thou men that they may search the land of canaan which i give unto the children of israel of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man everyone a ruler among them and moses by the commandment of the lord sent them from the wilderness of peran all those men who were heads of the children of israel i want to go down to verse 7 and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said unto them get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain and see the land what it is oh excuse me excuse me i said seven because i uh i dropped a one thank you all for poor poor charity she's trying to figure it out can we go to verse 17 now and i have it wrote here just as plain as day 7 but it's 17. and moses sent them to spy out the land of canaan and said unto them get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain and see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein whether they be strong or weak few or many and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and the cities they be that they dwell in whether in tents or in strongholds and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether there be wood therein or not and be of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes and then in verse 23 they came under the brook of eshkol and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bear it between two upon a staff and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs the place was called the brook eshkol because of the cluster of grapes which the children of israel cut down from thence can we read a little more and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to moses and aaron and all the congregation of the children of israel under the wilderness of paran to kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told him and said we came unto the land whether thou sentest us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it a few more verses nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of enoch there the amalekites dwell in the land of the south and the hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the canaanites dwell by the sea and by the coast of jordan that's a whole lot of ice living in the land isn't it and caleb still the people before moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for our we are well able to overcome it hear what he said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it nothing will stand in our way this was his testimony lord jesus we thank you this morning for your word it is life to us we thank you that you are even right now pulling us together in mind and spirit that we might fall under your anointing in this house lord we're not asking you to anoint your word it is anointed from the beginning but would you anoint our hearts would you anoint our spirits to receive your word with gladness may we open up every part of who we are that your word might penetrate and have its maximum effectiveness in us and would you anoint lips of clay and the mortal voice that i might be able to yield myself to whatever it is that you desire to do among us and we will give you the glory and the honor for it is in the name above every name the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the saints said you may be seated let's continue to read verse 31 but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we now here is one brother giving a report nothing will stand before us we are more than able to go up now and take the land nothing will be able to overcome us and here are the men one man and men m-a-n one man and men of course we know that joshua and caleb were standing together but we have the report of one man and we have the report of men two out of out of 12 gave a positive faith-filled report and the other ten we like to say gave a negative report but the bible said they gave an evil report and how many of you know there's a difference in being just negative and being evil when we taught you from the book of genesis when we see the word good in those first few chapters of genesis the hebrew word for good is tov t.o.v let's say that together tov and when we hear god say that it's not only good but it's very good the hebrew word is tov mayod and there are many words in the hebrew language for bad and they could be used but instead god the opposite of good for for god in moses 1 excuse me in genesis 1 through moses the opposite was not bad the opposite was evil the word is ra and so when when we are not in agreement with what god has promised and when we speak something from our being that is not in agreement with what god's word has said god doesn't say that's being negative that's what we say to one another don't be so negative but that's not what god calls it at all he calls it evil did you know the book of genesis helps us to understand when we are not bringing forth what we have been called to bring forth god doesn't call that a disappointment god doesn't call that being backslid when we are not manifesting what god has called us to manifest the hebrew language calls it evil and when god said you can overcome all things and we start making excuses for why people have not yet overcome when god says i want to give you total deliverance and we start explaining why you may not have total deliverance god doesn't call that being negative yeah i want to tell it today he calls that being evil so it's possible that even churches are giving evil reports not not just negative reports but evil reports when we are calling the shot only by what we can see with the natural eye in spite of what god has already said he wanted to do god doesn't call that negative he calls it evil so i want you and i to watch our words and we need to watch our thoughts and we need to watch our words and we need to watch what we come into agreement with we need to ask the holy spirit to reform and reshape our vocabulary so that when we open our mouth we are speaking the things that come into alignment with what god has said it's not only possible it's imminent it's not only possible that god is going to give us total deliverance it is upon us and this is the hour to claim it as we have never claimed it before if you believe that i want to hear you say something this is the hour where god desires to bring all the fruit into our lives of who we are as believers and that's how we started this service last sunday by reading mark chapter 16. can we go there just a moment mark chapter 16 verses 15-18 and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature we are not to decide who gets to hear it and who doesn't get to hear it we're not judging by the standard of our eyes whether someone has the capacity or the ability to believe or not we are to go and tell the good news to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be what saved but he that believeth not shall be what damn what is your commission not to save them not to damn them your commission is to tell them the good news preach the gospel to every creature and this was god's promise and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils come on now they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up servants and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and you tell me what will happen we're living below our means we're dealing with things that we shouldn't have to be dealing with as his bride in this late hour and why is that because we lay down and accept status quo and we got this idea that this is how it's been and so this is how it always will be but i want you to know it takes a joshua and a caleb who said i saw just what you saw i saw the same giants you saw i saw the same walled cities you saw i saw the same circumstances and difficulties that you saw but i choose to believe that god said i'm going to give you this land and i'm going to give you strength to dispossess the enemy to drive him out to take away his squatters rights to evict him from camping on the promise that you and i are supposed to possess is anybody with me we have victory because he says we do but we have got to make a choice he goes on let's read just a little bit more uh verse 32 again and they brought me up an evil report of the land which they have searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which they had searched excuse me the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof i want to read that again the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof i i strongly doubt that is there anybody here that strongly doubts that i strongly doubt that the promised land was opening up and swallowing inhabitants i think that we are venturing into the land of exaggeration [Music] and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature again not so they're not all tall there were some shorties there there were some average men there come on they saw the sons of enact they saw giants there and they chose to put everybody in the same category they're all giants they're all men of a great stature and we now know in fact with archaeology we can even prove that the canaanites in general were not very tall men we've even been able to prove that by archaeology so this again was an exaggeration the earth is not opening up and swallowing its own inhabitants this is an exaggeration and every man in this land is not of great stature again this is an exaggeration see what happens when you release an evil report it filters everything you see and perceive you filter everything through your negativity which is really evilness it's really evil and everything filters through that so what comes out of your mouth is usually a mixture of truth and exaggeration anybody following what i'm saying and god said that that's not just a minor offense this is an evil offense this is serious business we didn't send you in there to say that god's not able we sent you in there just to report the facts only the facts no exaggeration they're not all tall they're the ground isn't swallowing them up you saw some walled cities and they're great you saw some giants in the land but they're not all giants and if god said it belongs to us caleb said we are more than able if we'll just go up right now no training no army camps and training manuals if we'll just go up right now god will give it to us two with with wonderful report two with grapes ten with gripes that was so powerful griping bellyaching negative and evil speech is so powerful when it releases into the atmosphere it falls back down on whoever is vulnerable to hear this evil report it shifts our faith to doubt it causes unbelief to rise up it causes us to begin to make excuses for where we really are it causes us to be borderline believers it causes us to be satisfied living close enough to see the promise but not being able to hold it in our hand i'm not satisfied church to see what god can do or wants to do or might do through a people in the last days i want to reach in and take a hold of it as my own we can't be borderline believers living in the borderlands we've got to say hey it's there for the taking he goes on and there we saw the giants the sons of anak which come of the giants and we were in our own side here's the problem didn't say we're in each other's sight it said and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers now how does one see themselves as a grasshopper they don't do that with their eyes they do that with their what they do that with their mind they do that with their imagination they didn't really see grasshoppers in the land they really saw giants and they really felt like in their in their minds they felt like that they were just little grasshoppers and when you begin to see yourself as a grasshopper instead of a mighty giant you cut yourself off from what god is able to do in your life is anybody with me then look this way when you cut yourself off in your own mind from being what god has called you to be nobody can help you you're the only one that can help yourself you're the only one that can say wait a minute i may feel like a grasshopper but i'm not a grasshopper i'm an overcomer i may feel like a defeated folk but i'm not a defeated foe i'm really an overcomer i may feel like i'll never get rid of some of these things that trouble my life but i will because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world come on now you see being a borderline believer is a mindset it's a mindset and being satisfied to live on the borderland when you can go in and take the possession that god has promised you that's a mindset so we have to break that mindset and there's only one thing that breaks an evil report and a bad mindset and that is the truth of god's word we are well able we need a good report in a sea of negative reports we need a good report in a sea of evil reports we need somebody to say there will be an overcomer in the end time and if there's only one i am that one there will be a bride's revival manifest in the end time and if it only manifests for one there will be the reality of the creative spoken word manifested in the body and if there's only one to do it i am he you with me in the fifth seal they don't have this in the fifth seal you can have it for yourself you can look it up it's paragraph 24 for you that have the app on your phone he said but i believe i i'm not going to speak it in his name i'm going to speak it in my in the revelation of my faith that's good enough for me what happened in sabino canyon the other day i believe that the hour is approaching missing limbs will be restored 1963 322 fifth seal said i'm not saying this in the in his name but i'm speaking this in the revelation of my faith that what happened in sabino canyon the other day i believe that the hour is approaching when missing limbs will be restored and the glorious power of the creator i believe if he can make a squirrel appear that has no here is the man or woman just got a part missing and that's complete animal in itself he is god i love him and he goes on well you say wait a minute that's just one little isolated place there where he spoke well i want you to know there's something inside of me that grabs a hold of that and says i'm going to be one of them i'm going to be one of them that speaks the creative word of god and watches a missing limb a missing finger a missing arm a missing leg a missing foot material i'm going to be one of them now we don't need anybody saying i doubt that i will or i doubt that i can or i'm not sure it'll even be brother banham didn't say it in the name of the lord there's a lot of other things he didn't say in the name of the lord that people are claiming but i am claiming that there is going to be a people in the last days who rise up they decide to quit living as a borderline believer dwelling in the borderland and they say if god says it's possible i'm going to be a part of that i'm going to be a part of that i'm going to be a part of that we were in our own site as grasshoppers you better not look at yourself as you think because a man as a man thinketh in his heart so he is so he is that's what the word said so we better be thinking of ourselves as god sees us amen now let's go to numbers 14. read a little bit more i know we're having a time pressing through but that's all right we'll do it there's a reason and all the congregation verse 1 and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night we're going all the way to verse 12. and all the children of israel murmured against moses and against aaron and the whole congregation said unto them this this is the next chapter and the whole congregation said unto them would god that we had died in the land of egypt or would god we had died in this wilderness now i want you to know this evil report is having quite an effect they're already now beginning to walk out the results of what came out of their mouth now they're discouraged now they're discouraged now they're depressed now they don't have faith for anything and it just comes pouring out of their mouth and the first thing they do is they blame their leaders this is very very common we understand this it's nothing new and now they're almost blaming their god because they say i would to god we just died in the wilderness come on now something's wrong with people with this kind of a report coming out of their mouth this kind of confession let's go on and wherefore had the lord brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and children should be a prey were it not better for us it's just a handful of giants there really ain't that many of them it's just one family this one family they all got the same papa this one family and here's their attitude it'd be better for us to go back to egypt than to die out here and you know what in some ways i almost can't agree with that because i hear jesus saying i would that thou art hot or cold i would that you were either in the promised land or in egypt but to live over here in the borderland it's a sad shame for you to be satisfied with less than what god has made available to you if you'll just raise up and claim it we're not better for us to return into egypt let's go on and they said one to another let us make a captain god's already given you a captain he's already given you a prophet to lead you and here they say let us make a captain and let us return into egypt this doesn't sound very smart to me and then moses and aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of israel and joshua the son of noon and caleb the son of jephena which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes they tear their clothes in in a gesture of grief and repentance and they spake unto all the company of the children of israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land this was a gentle way of saying it's worth it we know you all haven't been there but we've been there and we've experienced enough of the goodness of the land that we would just like to say it's far better than egypt it's a good land it's a good thing to have it's a good thing to possess if the lord delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it us he's already promised it to them a land which floweth with milk and honey only rebel not ye against the lord neither fear ye the people of the land for they are bred for us there it is [Music] i eat giants for my bread you know the line from the song giants eat bread believers eat giants what a report what a report you know he's not meaning literally i'm going to eat them he's saying there are no more there's no more than just an apple in your hand to take a big bite off of they're no more than a slice of bread laying somewhere in the tent they are not able to defeat us it's only us that can defeat ourselves if we don't get up out of this molly grub if we don't make a stand now we'll be defeated all right but not by giants and walled cities we'll be defeated by our own confession how serious this is he said only rebel not he against the lord neither fear you the people of the land for they are bred for us their defense is departed from them and the lord is with us fear them not this is a word of prophecy what has caused them to thrive in the past and to be protected in the past is no longer with them because god has given them into our hands and there are no walls tall enough there are no cities large enough strong enough there are no giants tall enough to keep us from overcoming if we are a mind to go forward in the name of the lord he so let's go on fear them not but all the congregation made stone them with stones there's one thing i've learned about negative people they don't like being around people that aren't negative you know it never bothers me when people have friends in the church that are closer to them than other friends that doesn't bother me i believe we're one body i believe we should be one family but i have learned in my life that there are people that i can fellowship with easier than others there are people that make me nervous they don't mean to it's not not some big problem with them but they just do maybe some little things some condition or something they have or some of the condition i have or something i never have thought it was a it was an awful evil thing some people do but i've been around long enough to realize that there are just certain situations that that that we ought to just let god handle and let him take care and not be so worried about things like that but here's what i do worry about as a pastor when i see negative people clumping up you know what click i'm concerned about i'm concerned about the negative click i'm concerned because misery loves company negativity loves negativity evil speakers love evil speakers when you see people drawing to one another on an another level that's the kind of click i'm against i'm against it because it will defeat a whole nation it'll bring a whole people down and now these that have a positive report well they're just dreaming you know i mentioned this before i think i want to make the devil a little madder we're sitting in the back and i'm speaking to some of the brothers about the studio and about the direction of what we would like to see the lord do and talking about the promises and in some way i i feel like i'm trying to sell something a little bit because who's ever heard of taking pews out of a church and putting a a studio right inside the sanctuary we didn't have money to build a separate building and god had given us a prophecy that he was going to use this and for more than one he was going to give us a pulpit to the nations and we have one there anytime we want to use it it's there to use don't you be discouraged because god's going to use it for his glory and i'm thinking now we could maybe put in a floating floor right above the carpet so that we can take that up and the pews could go right back and that wall everything that you see there can be taken out the window is still there it's boarded up but there's a window there all we have to do is take the board down the ceiling fan we can put right back up and we could make that exactly like it was before we placed the studio there if the need would be and you know brother greeley how many of you know brother greeley his faith is there he don't have any problem getting a hold of something like that and so i'm looking for a little more support and here's the support i get well i guess we have all come to the conclusion to the understanding that as we have believed in the past it appears that the church is never going to be full so there really won't be any harm taking those pews out because we'll never need that space you know what i pray that the church when god really gets in this thing and this revival begins to flow i i pray that this this room with those pews won't hold them i i pray that god does what some of us have an idea that he's going to do i pray we have to turn that tabernacle into a place to worship god and that souls are delivered and set free and changed and and somebody said what in the world is going to draw somebody like that there's a bride out there waiting for a true report that god is manifesting himself you just let a finger come back you just let a toe grow back you just let an arm grow back and those people that have been waiting on those promises and waiting on the manifestation of the sons of god they're going to say i got to see that for myself it won't be for one place but there will be forerunners who forerun what god has said he was going to do come on now how in the world can we function as a people with that kind of report because what we have known in the past doesn't have to be what we know today and it doesn't have to be what we know tomorrow somebody has got to say if god says it i believe it his word cannot lie let all men be liars but god's word is yea and amen so now they're going to stone moses and aaron they're going to start stoning anybody who doesn't have the same negative report that they have all the congregation made stoned them with stone and the glory of the lord appeared my my in the greatest moment of persecution when their own people were turning against them to stone them what does god do he comes in the glory and the glory of the lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all naysayers too negative talkers too evil report givers too before all the children of israel now let's read on and the lord said unto moses how long will this people provoke me and how long will it be air they believe me for all the signs which i have showed among them i will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them this is serious talk now and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they do you understand that god was so disturbed by this evil report that he said i will destroy them all i will save you and make a mighty nation mightier than they to serve me that's i mean that that is pretty serious punishment here now look at verse 19. this is moses stepping up this is moses being an intercessor and i chose to read all these verses because we know the story but it's good sometime to grab the details he said pardon i beseech thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven this people from egypt even until now you've been such a forgiving god you've had so much mercy on us up to this point pardon i beseech thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven this people from egypt even until now and the lord said i have pardoned according to thy word the faith the decree of moses moved god and as you have spoken moses i have done it's pardoned it's over but truly as i live listen all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the lord because all those men which have seen my glory and my miracles which i did in egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice surely they shall not see the land which i swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see it none of the negative none of the evil report givers but my servant caleb because he had another spirit with him and hath followed me fully him will i bring into the land where unto he went and look read it his seed shall possess it now the amalekites and the canaanites dwelt in the valley tomorrow turn you and get you into the wilderness by the way of the red sea and the lord spake unto moses and unto aaron saying how long shall i bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me i have heard the murmurings of the children of israel which they murmur against me let's go down to verse all the way read all the way to 34. say unto them as truly as i live saith the lord as ye have spoken in mine ears so will i do to you your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness and all that were numbered of you according to your whole number from 20 years old and upward which have murmured against me doubtless she shall not come into the land concerning which i swear to make you dwell therein save caleb the son of jefferna and yah and joshua the son of noon but your little ones which he said should be a prey remember this declaration them will i bring in you said they would be food for the beast you thought they would feed the animals of the wilderness but i'm going to bring that generation in and they shall know and they shall know the land which ye have despised this is how god looks at that evil report of people despising their birthright so don't tell me it's all over when i realize it's just beginning don't tell me that it's finished when i realize it hasn't even come to its full manifestation yet but as for you your carcasses they shall fall in this wilderness and your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years and bear your whoredoms until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness now i want you to notice this god is saying you are guilty of whoredom you have played the that's what god's saying about these parents you have played the your children your whoredoms have to pass and your body has to fall like a carcass and your children are going to step over your carcasses to go into the promised land now let me ask you what the whoredoms were because we don't see in the bible where there was a plague of sexual sin among that older generation so what is it that they have done that has made them guilty in the eyes of god and and he has indicted them with the sin of playing the or being now we all know in the natural that when we think of that word that word or whoredom we think of a person a woman particularly giving herself to one man right after another right after another right after another mixture all of it with no commitment right no commitment just laying down with one and laying down with another and receiving this and receiving that and pondering this and pondering that instead of staying with the word see god's going to have a bride that eats his pure word not and listen let me tell you something and purity in purity if it's a pure word it has to be lined up with that written word of god that he has preserved for us through the years it's got to fit right in that word even as the prophet told us it was going to you see i'm not hanging my soul on a paraphrase i'm not hanging my soul on somebody's interpretation of the word i'm hanging my soul on the word interprets the word how many of you know how the word is interpreted it's interpreted by the word it's by it's interpreted by god bringing it to pass so we want to be careful how we lay down with this doctrine and lay down with that doctrine and with this idea and that idea and the other idea we want to be careful about google and and youtube and all the other ideas out there even around this message that we know do not line up with the word of god do i have to name them i don't think so this is the very sin of whoredom this is the very thing that god indicted his church for a generation ago and this is a thing that god indicted his people for in the old testament your whoredom has been you knew what god said but you begin to speak your own opinion you know i remember something that bob jones told me one time when we were fellowshipping he told me a story about an invitation that he kept getting and uh he he said i i can't go i knew that i couldn't go because i had an opinion i knew the only way that i could ever go and be a blessing to that group of people would be if i if i lost my opinion because if i went there with an opinion i would miss the mind of the lord i want you to know your opinion can cause you to miss the mind of the lord your opinion in a certain matter about a certain situation or about a certain person can cause you to miss the leadership of the holy spirit so we want to be careful in this hour that we submit all of our personal opinions to the word anybody with me i don't know if you heard that or not if you did i'm expecting that you might witness somehow here because your opinion can keep you out of what god is calling you in my opinion can keep me out of what god is calling me into your children are going to wonder let's go on after the number of the days in which you search the land even 40 days each day for a year shall you bear your iniquities even 40 years and ye shall know my breach of promise let's go on is that it is that the last yes that's it for you shall know my breach of promise now i want to read you from what shall we do with this jesus call christ paragraph 148 let's stay together for just another few minutes like the spies on the road to the promised land they was in an exodus coming out of egypt they come out by a promised word of god how many of you know that's how you came out of denominationalism you come out by promised word of god god made his word known by prophet moses sent him down there he was identified that he was the god to bring him out listen he was identified that he was the god to bring him out under the conditions that he promised to the i am when they come to the borderland kedesh barnia the great mistake they made when they got to the land and looked over into the promised land they said read that for me we can't take it what was the other ten they looked at the circumstance the prestige they would lose you'd think that when you came to a message of the hour like we have you think that your pride wouldn't be your hindrance and you would think that your reputation wouldn't be your hindrance and you think that your prestige would no longer be your hindrance you would think that you would be willing to be identified with god's new birth you'd think that nothing else would matter to you but we find that it's just not always so because the enemy is always there to remind us of our reputation and how we are esteemed you're going to have to come to the place where you don't care how other people look at you you're going to have to come to the place where you don't let anybody judge your shout out or your dance or your praise or your tongue talking or anything else that god does you're gonna have to be fully persuaded yourself because if you're still worried about your prestige i'm gonna swallow that give me a minute what was the other ten they looked at the circumstances the prestige they would lose we are grasshoppers to the side of them but joshua and caleb checked up it's time for a checkup it's time for a checkup it's time to ask ourselves the question am i a borderline believer or am i all the way am i sold out is there anything standing in my way from being everything that god has called me to be if there is there's an answer we can have deliverance we can be set free from it do you believe that but joshua and caleb checked up they went back to the word and the lord said i give you this land it's a good land flowing with milk and honey they didn't count what it looked like what that was what this was and what this evidence was god's word said i give it to you go get it and they were the only ones that went in said oh let us check the promise of god for today that's right remember we're in another exodus a time an exodus this time not into a promised land of the earth but into a promised land of glory where there is no return no more glory to god he said we're going to be there will you do it while we bow our heads this was the call for the altar now let's look at another here the mark of the beast and the seal of god number two this is paragraph 68. he said just like it says over there many gets turned up in that hebrews their sea if we sin willfully after we receive the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins take a motherlock someone asked me said what does that mean if we sin willfully after we receive the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin well he hasn't never got into it yet that's right he just received the knowledge of it oh i'm glad he said just like in israel when israel started a cross going into the promised land they sent the spies out two of them come back and said we can take it joshua and caleb the other one said no we can't do it so they hung right there on the border listen until they died and the ones believed the promise went over in hallelujah like a woman a boy gets a call in his life he said well mama washed over the washboard to send me to school i want to be a minister all right he becomes a minister he goes away and gets a phd or his doctorate degree or whatever he gets he comes back his bachelor of art or whatever it is he comes back anyhow he's a minister then he's always lusting and things in his church the ladies and the different things maybe smokes and he knows he ought to do that say god that don't look good for a man of god then take that thing away from me he's sanctified he comes right up to the borderland again he looks right over and sees the baptism of the holy ghost listen listen brother branham is making a powerful point here bible school can't save you there's a lot of preachers preaching today because they got a certificate from a bible school with no real conversion with no real born-again experience so here's a boy that goes through that he comes home he's still smoking he's still lusting he's still carrying on somehow he gets through that he presses through he comes to a place of sanctification he's a preacher for crying out loud how can we tolerate such things but he gets to his sanctification he comes right up to the borderland again looks right over sees the baptism of the holy ghost but he said if i do the denomination will throw me out i've spent all this money on a bible school certificate from a particular denomination and if i go in and get the holy ghost they're going to throw me out and so what does he do he values that paper he values his license he values his ordination from man over his birthright he said go on back and die in the borderland then if you want to he that sin what is sin unbelief i want somebody to tell me a definition of sin besides unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already that's right you don't even get the first what if committing adultery is not a sin smoking cigarettes and drinking is not a sin that's the attributes of unbelief the first time i heard this it nearly blew my little holiness mind come on because i grew up in an environment where everything was sin and then i hear brother branham say this this in itself is not sin it's the attribute of sin the sin is unbelief there's an unbelief problem that causes you to keep looking to these other things there's a problem with unbelief that causes you to keep running here and running there these are the attributes of unbelief if you was a believer let's read that slow if you was a believer you wouldn't do that if you was a believer you wouldn't do that let's read that real slow if you was a believer you wouldn't do that so we got a believing problem we've got a sin problem we've got people running to this attribute and that attribute when the real problem is not that god has placed that on their life as some people would have you to believe the problem is they've never had a breakthrough they've never broken through into a new birth dave you know what the new birth is for it's to help you deal with the problem of unbelief you're born from another world you're born from above you're born from another dimension then and the things that attract you here in this old life they don't have the same attraction the problem church is not the spirit of addiction the problem is unbelief we've got to believe that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him we've got to believe that he who the son makes free is what we've got to believe that and we've got to quit disqualifying ourselves and we've got to say lord if you can deliver anybody you can deliver me if you can deliver anybody from pornography you can deliver me if you can deliver anybody from the spirit of lust lord you can deliver me if you can deliver anybody from the attributes of sin like alcoholism nicotine addiction you can deliver me if you can deliver anybody from food addiction you can deliver me if you was a believer you wouldn't do that somebody said that is so discouraging because here i am and i think i'm a believer and yet those things are still pulling me let me let me just encourage you to check up just do a checkup don't be condemned don't go out of here and say here i've been doing my best and i go to church they tell me i'm not even a believer listen a believer believes it's just that simple and if the enemy can cause you to not believe if he can cause you to miss believe then your misbelief will not only affect you but like those ten spies it will affect everybody around you it affected a whole generation of people it caused the whole people to fall like carcasses in the wilderness so that a new generation could rise up and take god i want you to know that there is going to be a people they're even positioning now positioning now to take this promise with everything that mark 16 promises they shall lay hands on the sick and the shadow cove they shall cast out devils in my name they shall speak with new tongues and if they drink any deadly poison it shall not harm them they shall take up serpents and not be harmed remember it's not just this it's is not the slithery kind but the two-legged kind can be slithery too come on remember the apostles said i fought those beasts at ephesus and yet the greek word helps us to understand he wasn't talking about lions and tigers and bears he wasn't fighting pooh's problems no no no not lions tigers and bears no no no he was fighting two-legged beasts the kind that stand upright the kind that opposed the real deliverance the kind that opposed the real baptism of the holy ghost the kind that opposed a real holy ghost meeting with slobbering and snotting and babbling and children under the glory under the power of god don't even know what they're doing if you can just get them to the place where they can yield themselves and the spirit of god begin to talk out of them in some way it may not sound like anybody else but i remember the old-timers used to say it's beautiful to god so i found myself speaking over these young people it may not sound like anybody else's witness but it's beautiful to god can you imagine what it does what kind of a ripple it sounds it sins through eternity when there are young people like around here tuesday night who pray all the way through an experience and i know that there are whole movements of people who believe that young people must go out and experience sin we have movements among the truth even that have this idea the only way to really appreciate salvation is to go out and live like the devil for a while and then you'll really know how to appreciate things when you come back to christ i tell you what i want you to know i have a god and i have enough confidence in that god to believe that he has power not only to redeem the one that has experienced that level of unbelief but i believe he has the power to keep those who put their trust in him why couldn't he hold on to a michaela why couldn't he hold on to his zachary why couldn't he hold on to a carter why couldn't he hold on to amaya why couldn't the holy ghost just hold on to them so that they never have to go out there and experience the real depths of the attributes of unbelief may they never have to have an addiction other than one to christ may they become addicted to the holy ghost may they refuse to live without that connection why can't it be that way that's what believers believe he said that was a believer you wouldn't do that see that's right that's exactly right see there's unbelief he said what is it if we disbelieve willfully you out here tonight presbyterian methodists are you without the holy ghost if we disbelieve willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth for someone to say i believe the message of the hour and then to deny the necessity of a new birth and a holy ghost experience in this day somebody's on dangerous ground for you to preach that god restored the gifts through pentecost and then to preach that they are no more for this hour you're on dangerous ground you're on dangerous territory and for you to buy that idea you're on dangerous ground it's like saying the very scripture that the brother that the prophet is using here he said if we disbelieve willfully after we say we've received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin you turn your back on god what do you do then can you imagine believing when you first heard this truth that it's going to take a holy ghost baptism and it's going to take total deliverance and then coming on 30 years later and coming to this idea well nobody can really seem to break through to that so it must not be the plan of god for today why don't you make up your mind i'm going to be the one that does i'm going to be the one that lives above lust i'm going to be the one that lives above addiction i'm going to be the one that lives above these things i'm going to be the one that keeps my mind focused on the things of god he said you turn your back on god what what do you do then seal yourself away you take the mark of the beast and you go off like cain did from the presence of god anybody hearing this he said that's shaking isn't it come right up to the borderline would you just read that with me come right up to the borderline come right up to the borderline and then don't believe it you believe it but you're scared to take it he that sins willfully disbelieves willfully after he's received the knowledge of the truth i'll tell you he's breaking this down he said regard quote that with me he that sins willfully after that he has received the knowledge of the truth there are made of no more sacrifice for sin but he said a fearful looking for the fiery judgment and i will repay saith the lord it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a living god he's pronouncing a judgment here long beach california he said after it's brought right up to you and showed you that it is the seal of god and just because of prestige you have to give up something or quit your denomination or something to receive it and then you walk away from it what a powerful message to deliver in a mixed congregation where people had come of all denominations to see the miracles and brother branham said to the people see god brought you here he shows you the demonstration of the holy ghost you walk all the way up to it and then refuse to step in because you know you would be pressed out of your church you remember the story of daisy osborne you remember how that they had gone she and tommy osborne had gone to india as missionaries for the assemblies of god and they basically had their heads handed to him on a silver platter because they had no power over the demons they had this vision and a zeal and a burden to go see the lost but they had no preparation because bible school had now prepared them to deal with the measure of witchcraft they were going to face in india in those days so they had very limited success they came back to the united states beat up and almost ready to throw in the towel and brother branham begins to rise up on the scene he's preaching in the west coast they mention it to brother tommy osborne he's not interested in going he knows he's washed up and almost defeated but he's not interested in going because he knows what'll happen to him if people see him there and daisy you know if you know anything about her she was a pretty feisty kind of like their daughter ladonna kind of a feisty sort of creature and she just found her a grandma she just found her a woman in her 80s who had already lived her life and got to a place she didn't care what the church thought about her they stood in the pulpits all across america and they said don't go to the brand of meetings because he's preaching a strange doctrine and strange things are taking place so we're we're we're encouraging our our members not to go and support the brand of meeting now this was kind of a strange thing because the assemblies of god churches were sponsoring the meeting so there was a few renegade pastors who said we're going to have a meeting regardless of what they say they can kick us out if they want to but most of the people were scared to go so so daisy she reached out and found her a granny in her 80s who said i'll go to those meetings with you and i don't care what they say about me it don't matter if they turn their back on me or throw me out of the church or whatever they want to do if god's down there moving in that hall i want to be right in the middle of it isn't that something here's one that said i don't want to come all the way up to the borderline i don't want to come all the way up to the borderline and refuse to cross and so they went and they saw the goodness of god they saw the miracles they saw the signs and wonders and they heard truth they'd never heard before and she goes home and tells tommy what's wrong with you her husband what's wrong with you are you really afraid of what they're going to do to us why don't you come and see for yourself so he went and hid behind the post he stood up in the balcony and hid behind the post he didn't want anybody to see him there and his testimony after that meeting was this for the second time in my life i saw jesus step into a man the first time was in a vision or a dream an experience that i had with the lord i saw a little man standing out there and i saw jesus step into that man and begin to minister like he did when he was on the shores of galilee when i got to the meeting that night i didn't want anybody to see me i didn't want them to know i was there but i could not help but the fact that here come a little man kind of kind of uh teetering out onto the platform and stood there just a very uh non-impressive sort of fella and in my mind i'm thinking this is the guy that i have reached my reputation to hear a mismatched suit an out-of-style tie and he comes to the microphone bowser's head over toward the mic like that like he thinks you have to be close to it for it to hear you he bow brother brandon bows over to the microphone like that he says good evening friends and tommy osborne said i'd never experienced jesus like i experienced him in that moment i realized that it wasn't that little humble man it wasn't that little non-assuming man that was going to get the job done it was the jesus that stepped into him that was going to get the job done don't you love to hear a story like that let me tell you something folks here's where people miss this they say well that was brother branham it was what of you what of me what of us that man that jesus stepped into on that platform that radically changed tommy osborne's ministry he said from that moment from that moment on i was never the same because i now knew that what jesus did in that little man he could do in me i've been in message churches where they told that story because they heard it from me or from my friend and i've been in message churches where they repeated that story and they love to hear that story they love to tell that story and then they say they run their disclaimer and they say imagine that imagine tommy osborne thinking that jesus would step into him let me tell you something that's the goal of the new testament church isn't that why we get people to the holy ghost so jesus can step into them isn't this the jesus life that we're supposed to be living right now that doesn't give you a a prophesied ministry that doesn't say you're one of a million it doesn't say that you're a messenger to an age but what it says is these same works shall you do and greater [Applause] jesus said to those who would listen don't be satisfied doing what you see me do you can do this and you can do greater because i go to my father and that's why i can witness to seeing things and knowing of things that happened in brother ham's ministry that didn't even happen in the earthly ministry of jesus christ and that's why i can believe that there's going to be a bride a many-membered bride that's not just made up of preachers it's not just made up of fifa ministry and it's not an all-male show no amen but a body show a body ministry a demonstration of body ministry where jesus is stepping into them and they just open their mouth and he speaks and they just extend their hand and he reaches and they just yield their feet and ewoks you see even our lord said i can do nothing except i see my father doing it brother branham was in the same ministry i can do nothing except he i'm waiting on something you know i'm waiting on some there he is brother branham showing us just what it would have been like to have sat there in the ministry of jesus christ he said i can do it unless i see envision my father doing it and brother brown the same day you know i'm waiting on something how many of you have ever heard it on tape you know i'm waiting on something he said you know i'm waiting on something you know i'm just trying to i'm just trying to talk a little bit here and i'm just waiting on something when he comes when when he comes i'm just waiting on something i'm just going to tell you a little story or something here waiting on him there he is and then he began to open his mouth and god was able then to discern the needs of the people and minister accordingly i believe it was hawk told me today because we know of a great need in a body in a physical body of someone in our church a great physical need a real miracle needed that only god can provide and you see how how dire it looks and how how negative it looks in the natural how serious it looks in the natural but i think he said he was listening to one of the sermons on melchizedek and at the end of that service brother branham says something about hawk what was that a lady laying there on a cot at the end of the meeting is he the same then why would we settle for being borderline believers living in a borderland when the whole promise of god is waiting on us just who dare to believe just somebody dare to believe that's all god's waiting on this hour is somebody who'll dare to believe brought right up to you and showed you that it's the seal of god just because of prestige you'd have to give up something or quit your denomination or something to receive then walk away from it you know what you do you seal yourself out of the kingdom brother man i wasn't looking for some tattoo he said this is the mark of the beast selling your soul for some compromised denomination where did the book of revelation say the seal would be the mark would be on the forehead and on the right hand right the forehead representing the intellect it's a sealing away that takes place because of the intellect of man and that glorious you know right hand to fellowship people joining into a system that is so far removed from the whole counsel of god's word that it's just a bear bare imitation of what god really desires to do in people's lives and yet they're selling out for that on and on and on and ago is there more when god told abel or cocaine said just go over and worship like your brother this is more than we read he said just go over and worship like your brother bring a lamb come down here and worship like your brother said you'll do all right do as your brother does you'll be all right now this really this really slaps this doctrine that i hear preach sometime that god rejected cain's offering because of his origin that he could not have brought a proper sacrifice because he was of the wrong seed but that's not what the prophet is saying here he's saying god gave him an opportunity if you'll just go bring the right offering god will hear your prayer just like you or anybody else that's pretty powerful isn't it don't get mad i'm just reading he said bring a lamb come down here and worship like your brother said you'll do all right do as your brother does you'd be all right but he wouldn't do it said this is the best i can offer and listen to this attitude this is what proved who he was he said you can take it or leave it this is this is the best i've got and he was marked and went out of the presence of god because he wasn't willing to offer the right kind of worship and he went out sealed from the presence of god i want to go to why real quick i i i i would like to finish a little earlier because we've had such a hard time getting where we are i don't want to belabor but i'd like to go to this message why paragraph 29 if you'll stay with me and you're with me now so thank you he said reminds me like like in someone asked me the question or not hebrews 10 where they who willfully have sin willfully and have to renew themselves unto repentance why there's nothing left for them but the fearful looking for the judgment he that despised moses law died under two or three witnesses how much sorer punishment supposed thou worthy who has trod the blood of jesus christ under their feet and counted it an unholy thing done despite to the works of grace i said you you read over in deuteronomy 14 and and forgive me for saying but if you read deuteronomy 14 you'll find nothing there about the spies it's numbers 14 where we just read he said you read over in numbers 14 where those spies israelites went with caleb and joshua right up to the borderland they tasted the grapes that came from the land but when they went back they were unbelieving and cowards we brought a mighty preacher here one time years ago a mighty preacher one who shook me with his messages it was the first year i think of our camp meeting and the preachers that were invited to speak wouldn't speak couldn't get him to speak this being one of them we brought him from another continent in the few days that he was here he saw things and he felt things and he didn't know what to do about him he even rose up in a there was a another brother who wasn't invited as a speaker he's passed away now he wasn't invited as a speaker but i gave him a morning service and he began to preach what was on his heart and this great speaker mighty man very well known even today this man rose up in the middle of his sermon and he began to have almost like a fit this great speaker he began to kind of have some fit or something and he was resisting and arguing with what the preacher was saying and somehow or another he ended up in the altar and how god met him anybody remember hold up your hand if you remember two two people three people remember three of the ones that's here he got down in that sawdust and rooted like a pig i'm not making fun i've done the same he got down in the sawdust and he made a trench with his nose as god was stripping the pride off of his life and what he came to resist got a hold of him and he gave his testimony and preached for us and this was his words i came here an experienced minister of the gospel preached in other nations of the world and i thought i had everything i needed but i began to recognize after i got here that i needed a birth is that what he said he's coming to preach to us because i'd heard him preach one of the most outstanding messages i've ever heard my life never never heard a greater message and he dealt with every false doctrine you can imagine in that message so i wanted to be identified with that kind of of a rebel who could preach like that and stir the devils up like that he said but as i got here i realized i have i need a new birth i had to have a new birth he said i want somebody to get me a jar he said because i want to take a jar of this sawdust home with me he pastored a church of several thousand people at that time he said i want to take a jar of this sawdust home with me because i want to show everybody where i met the pillar of fire and where i received a new birth am i telling the truth you that were here hold up your hand if that's similar to what was it and i expected that the world was about to be set on fire by that brother i said he'll he'll go home surely and he'll testify to his church and his church will be turned upside down and those people will cry out for the new birth it'll shake the continent of africa and i knew he already had a ministry in in europe and i said it'll probably turn europe upside down came all the way up to the borderland and even got a taste of the grapes and i don't know if it was on the plane home or after he got home but somewhere along the way he realized this will cost me i'll never be invited to preach the edmonton convention anymore i'll never be invited to preach such and such a convention anymore i'll never be invited to go over here anymore come on because this will cost me this requires a price a heavy price you know here i am thinking this is going to turn the whole thing around but in his mind it's going to shut it all down sometimes god wants to shut it down so that he can raise up just like he told moses he said just let him die if you'll just let him die i'll raise up a mightier people than they amen you'll just let me shut it down i will but somehow along the way that brother was not willing he wasn't willing to be associated with that sawdust and instead of going to the pulpit like he said it would it must have found its place in the bottom of a drawer somewhere and about four five six years later someone sent me a tape and i heard him given his testimony and his experience the experience that he described here on this campground nothing could be any farther from the truth than what happened are you saying he told us yes his testimony was a lie it was nothing like happened here when i was reading this quote i couldn't help i hadn't thought of that situation in years but my mind went back to that very situation it's a very very dangerous thing to come all the way up to the border land and taste the grapes that come from the land but they went back they were unbelieving and cowards he said oh we can't take it it's too much for us oh they they they we look like grasshoppers up beside of them the cities are all walled in how many of you know god showed him a little bit later he knew how to take care of wall cities they saw those intimidating walls and they said we cannot take it but caleb steal them and joshua said we can take it we're more than able yet we being the minority but we can take it why those spies was looking at conditions what the price they'd have to pay but caleb and joshua was looking at a promise of god are you still still with me god said i've given you that land go possess it glory the holy ghost is for whosoever is called to this wedding supper i don't care what price you have to pay go get it god said it's yours if you don't get it he's gonna ask you why didn't you get it why it was there for you if they didn't possess the land why there was too many against us he said well if god said if i'm for you who could be against you it's there what's the matter there's something wrong with the individual now watch he said many you you take a young minister feels the call of god in his heart he will repent of his sins go off to school get his education which is fine he'll come back smoke cigarettes maybe still got a lustful spirit to say well i don't want that lord take it away from me the spirit of god will come and sanctify his soul and take that desire away from him then he will be brought right up to the borderland set right in the meetings and watch the workings of the holy spirit see others get healed hear them speak with tongues see wonder signs and wonders done they'll sit around and watch it but afraid to put their hand on it that's that borderline believer that's that fellow if ever turns away if he ever turns away there's no more remission for him stand right up here and even look over into the land who's received the knowledge of the truth out of knowledge of the truth know that that was right but because of prestige well if i do this it'll do this and if i accept that it'll do this see they refuse it they walk away from it oh listen if you're watching this and you're somewhere around the world other than right in the middle of this service here in alabama i want to beg you i i could care less about my reputation or my prestige i don't really have any left but i would implore you i would strongly encourage you not to live another day as a borderline believer the holy ghost baptism is real the genuine new birth is real the supernatural god is real i encourage you not to worry about what others would say but go after it with everything you've got [Applause] what if i speak in tongues so be it what if i mess up my hair so be it what if i slobber and snot so be it what if i lose my place in the church so be it what if my own family won't talk to me so be it there comes a time when we must make the decision to take god at his word and refuse to live in the border land go after it with everything you've got he said and count the blood of the covenant wherewith he was sanctified that far to bring him up on a step to look over into and have a knowledge of it he was saved and sanctified but comes up here to look over to receive the holy ghost that new birth he wants nothing to do with listen the new birth is not completed without the baptism of the holy ghost you must have the genuine baptism of the holy ghost and someone makes this comment because the prophet talks about the seal of god and he talks about the last feeling being without sensation and i want you to understand that you have to take god at his word whether you feel anything or not we don't know we have it because we have a feeling we know we have it because we met god's conditions we know we have it because we've followed the bible prescription we've repented of our sins we've been baptized in the name of lord jesus christ and we have been sanctified by the washing of the water of the word and we have recognized god's voice to us in this hour and because of that we come knocking fill me fill me with the holy ghost i want that new birth to be complete i don't want just an issue of water and an issue of blood but i want the issue of life i want to know that i know that i know he was saved and sanctified but comes up here to look over and receive holy ghost a new birth he wants nothing to do with it he'll say oh i guess that's all right for them kind of people but me oh it's all right but i will someday now there's the trouble that man is sick and don't want to take the doctor's medicine what do you do with somebody like that he's sick but he don't want to take the doctor's medicine it's a very serious indictment isn't it are you good for one more good i've got i've got to power of decision 1955 verse paragraph 65 god said these signs shall follow them that believe lay hands on the sick they shall recover it's a good land said joshua it's a wonderful land joshua you and caleb aren't you glad that this is a wonderful land i am amen joshua and caleb brought back some initial evidence that they'd been over there somewhere i'm so glad tonight that we've got witnesses in the church tonight that's been somewhere that's got something let's come back with the evidence that the holy ghost is just the same tonight as it was the day it fell on pentecost can i ask you here i'm not trying to embarrass you but is there anybody here this morning that can say i've been over there somewhere and i got a hold of something that's real and i know that it was just as real to my life as it was on the day of pentecost put your hand up just the same tonight as it was the day it fell on pentecost hallelujah make your choice are you going to stand with the theologians that says well we just can't take it we come through the wesley age we come through this but we could never stand another fanaticism we could never stand it away with such stuff god said jesus rose from the dead he's the same yesterday today and forever we can take it it's ours we're able glory hallelujah what we need tonight is do it hallelujah it's yours the promises unto you and your children and them in chicago where he's ministering in as many as the lord our god shall call freedom of choice to me he's the same to me he will keep his promise to me he was wounded for my transgression he was bruised for my iniquity the chastisement of my peace was upon him with his stripes i'm healed hallelujah he said i believe hallelujah do you believe it he said it's your choice now we're at the borderland we've come through many dangerous toils and snares i've already come it was grace that brought me safe thus far following the blessed old bible it's grace that'll take me on amen the promise we're on the borderland tonight the bible said i would above all things you prosper in health it's yours god promised it the promise to you is just as good as it was to israel he said i've given you that land i will send my angel this pillar of fire before you to guide you to the place divine healing's yours god promised it to you i just felt the spirit of the lord speaking to my heart somebody who's streaming this service right now there are things coming into your mind pictures and reminders are coming into your mind of things in your life that would have to change and i want to ask you right now to get your mind off of what may have to be laid aside or what price you might have to pay and understand that it's worth every every sacrifice it's worth losing everything else to win christ to know that you have been born again must be a backslider that god was calling to right then and some of you look at your favorite holidays and you look at your jewels and you look at the things you love your your fake eyelashes and all the things you've come to love and you wonder how could i ever get along without those things oh i want you to know once you've really tasted of this good promise once you listen once you've come under the influence and inspiration of the genuine holy ghost nothing out there nothing out there compares to the peace and the assurance if we could capture that moment for these young people that received the holy ghost here tuesday night if we could capture that moment and cause them somehow to live in that moment they would never want the things of this world they would never want the pleasures of this life they would never want to yield themselves to the lust and to the compromise of this world again get your eyes off of what you might lose and get your eyes on what you can gain through a real experience with jesus christ divine healing's yours god promised it to you he sent the holy ghost he's guided you to this place let's take it amen it's ours he goes on same god made the promise to israel made it to you he's the same yesterday today and forever send the same signs wonders and miracles now he ain't gonna come just push it down you it's not going to shove it down our throats you you're going to have to take it and as soon as you claim it there'll stand an old amorite standing there listen kick him you got a friend that opposes this old holy ghost baptism with the new birth what are you preaching just say what he said there will be an amorite there will be an amalekite there will be a hittite and the jebusite and the canaanite there will be and they'll try to stand between you and the promise

like caleb let me have that bunch over yonder amen they said oh why they're so much bigger that don't make any difference goliath boiled out his brag too but he met a david one day too amen the devil's done said the days of miracles pass and got into the preachers and preached that all through the country but there arose about david [Applause] not long ago amen got his head chopped off now and i'm telling you that israelite armies have beaten it from the north to the west east south everywhere else around the world great healing campaigns proving oh this doesn't sound like a man who thought he had the only ministry this doesn't sound like a man who thought he was the only one that god was with or moving among he said it's everywhere healing campaigns proving that jesus raised from the dead and it's a healer hallelujah he said the holy ghost is our david amen he's leader of this pack we believe him he said us let us talk to him a minute with our heads bowed any good [Music]

he's here he's here the lord is here and he'll meet you if you want to be met can anybody say man are you going to leave me by myself a lot of moving around i understand that but don't let your attention distract from the front hear what's being said in case god is calling to you be seated in the message questions and answers number three in paragraph 69 i wasn't going to read this he said now what let me just give you a little twister here just a minute this is questions and answers number three 64. should be the last one from last sunday let me just give you a little twister here just a minute i'd say how many has the holy ghost all of you raise up your hand i'd say all right i'll see if you have the bible said that they that had the holy ghost sighed and cried for the abominations done in the city can you hear me how many hand would go up how many of you can't rest at night so full of joy the power of god and so sad for the people that's lost that day and night you weep and cry for the abominations who would be that in the city how many is that in the church he said that's what the bible said the holy spirit evidence was he told the sealing angel ezekiel 9 go through the city and set a mark upon those which sigh and cry for the abominations done in the city the rest of them let the destroying angel destroy them no matter how much members they had how many of the things they've done a man with an incorn rider dressed in white which represents holy spirit came forth and put a mark upon all them that sighed and cried for the abominations done in the city and watch that and watch what he said in there also slay utterly all of them little children old women babies kill them all yes paragraph 71 when joshua entered the land of canaan he said don't you let one of them live if it's a cute little baby a little amalekite or amorite kill it you remember he'll grow up to be an amalekite he'll pollute the camp and when those little things come back like that disagreeing with the word of god get rid of that thing i don't care what denomination it belongs to you say well they're good i don't care how good of people they are if they're contrary to the word get that thing out of you [Music] it's a growing little amalekite it looks cute it looks innocent it looks like it's all right but don't you have anything to do with it you stay away from it that little enemy will rise up to tell you you need not try to take the land you have only one decision to make only one choice and that is you got to push that thing out of the way you've got to slay that lie you've got to kill the lie the enemy will rise up in a service like this he'll say you've heard that before oh they've said it before kill that lie kill that amalekite don't let that lie live in your head don't you let the enemy keep you from what god has promised you in this hour now you can stand power of decision 106. to you who is in this audience who has not a prayer card and believes

hallelujah hallelujah praise god [Music] thank you jesus [Music] yes [Music] jesus thank you thank you [Music] is [Music] for me hallelujah [Music] lord of hallelujah [Music] i just want to say something as we close i just want to say this to you you can just play soft if you will my vehicle was in the shop and i don't know if you experienced this or not but uh i always like to have a newer vehicle because i don't know anything about mechanics and i don't know how to fix anything take care of anything but it seems like if anything ever gets wrong with mine or arrive with mine it's it's not under warranty anybody ever experienced that i don't know why i'm so blessed that every everything i need help with and i did god knows my heart i did raise my voice but i wasn't i wasn't angry enough to punch anybody but i did raise my voice and i said now let me tell you when i drove off the lot that problem was there and it's not fixed and and it is under warranty he said no sir it's not i said well we're going to run this up the ladder until we find somebody that says it is now i do have i do have a problem that's under warranty it's my transmission and it does crazy things and they put it on the machine and it told them what what was wrong with each part of the transmission but he said mr shelley we can't do that we can't fix that right now because he said the factory has ordered another fix that has to be done first and we've got to fix this first and then we can fix the problem that you've complained about that you've mentioned and noticed but he said if we fix this if we address your complaint and we don't do this other first he said we will have much more serious problems than we have right now now i hadn't thought of that he said it i listened i probably couldn't get past my aggravation for for for my sunroof being out of warranty and a leak and all that so i as i was standing there praying for sister hope my mind went back and it came to me again when i was praying for brother shane there there's an order sometime to to to deliverance to victory to to to walking in freedom there's a layer to it just like fixing my transmission he said now mr shelley if in 200 miles you don't see a difference he said i know right now what we're gonna do next and he began to outline the problem and he said if that doesn't fix it you're under warranty to 101 000 miles on this transmission and he said if that don't fix it we'll put a new we'll have to put a new transmission in there so not only does have have we followed the order he had to do the factory fix first then he addressed the problem and he thinks this is going to fix it but if that don't fix the problem they already know what they're going to do next and as i was standing there praying for sister hope i just felt like i should say now that there are times i believe in total and complete help from the lord but there are times that he has to address maybe not even the thing you've come up here for maybe you've come with one need and you want the lord to minister to that but he sees you and he sees something that needs to be lined up first so he starts taking care of that so that he can then come and do what you're asking him for does that make sense to anybody there's an order to this thing so when you stand in the presence of the lord to worship you don't have to tell him what order to do things in you just tell him what you need and be ready for him to do what you need you be ready for him to do first what he sees needs to be done first and then he'll take care of the next there's an order in the spirit life there's an order of things and he wants to take care of one thing sometime before another level is addressed and when i was praying for her the lord was was saying to me on a level and another level and another level how many of you want god to address every level of your need you want him to go right down and and touch one thing and and raise you up and touch another thing and raise you up and touch another thing and raise you up so if you're standing here you don't feel like what you came for has been addressed that's all right you just take what the lord will do you just accept what the lord has done and you believe him to finish the rest would you just raise up both hands let me just speak to you as you've got your hands lifted up father here we stand in the presence of the lord here we stand in your holy presence and there are many things we want it all and we want it all now in fact we want it all yesterday but we submit right now to the leadership of the holy spirit we submit to your wisdom and we submit to your timing because you are god's sovereign and you are god's supreme and right now in one mind in one accord we thank you for what you have done would you thank him for what he has done we thank you for what you have done and we thank you for what you're doing next and what you're doing next and what you're doing next because you're building up a house that you can dwell in you're building up a home that you can dwell in and we give you praise and we give you honor and we give you glory and we pray right now for those who couldn't be here today we pray for those who were sick who had a positive test and we pray for those who had symptoms and they didn't want to spread anything we pray for them right now and we ask you lord to deal with their bodies and to curse those nasty symptoms and let them have perfect wholeness and healing in the name of the lord jesus christ hallelujah one more thing i wanted to do before we go i want you to know god has been good to us and since march of of last year we've paid over half of the debt that we have carried on this property and some of you know that we had some compounds and some complications along the way and you might also know that we we took in that property up there that brother west had bought for the church and we were making payments on that and his brother wes began to get a little bit older he wanted wanted his name not to have to be put he brother shelly what's going to happen if something happens to me and my name is on everything so he wanted us to begin to shift things out of his name and i went to the bank and they when it was time to redo this loan the last time they took in that property that mobile home that hawk and maribeth live in and the acreage there so that it's all a part of the same property and so god has been mighty good to us and he has really helped us and i have a bill here that's due on on august the 22nd of when the loan comes to maturity and if you don't think that'll just shock you i'm used to looking at 3 900 due every month the payment is 3 900 and today when i open up my bill the whole loan is due this month right have you ever got one like that cost the bill because the loan is run out it's a commercial loan it's only for a certain amount of time and it runs out and so i have a bill here in in the church's name but i happen to know brother stephen shelly and brother wesley greeley are the guarantors on this bill so brother greeley and i have a bill we have your bill in our name this due on the 22nd i just want to read this out like hezekiah i just want to stretch this before the lord because it's not too late it's not too late and my bill says that on the 22nd of august we are due to give the bank 239 thousand three hundred and eighty five dollars and sixty one cent but but january of 2021 it was almost a half a million dollars now that's the goodness of god that's the goodness of god so they're going to give us an extension and they're going to get we're going to settle the paperwork with them and they're going to give us a loan here's what bothers me we're going to pay a loan origination fee and we're going to pay all the other fees that go along because it'd be like a brand new loan and that means they get all their money again that's one of the ways they manage to to get us on commercial property so that means that today we owe 239 thousand three eighty five sixty one before this is over to be another somewhere between three thousand and five thousand added to that god knows that i don't wanna give him that i don't wanna give it to him i'm gonna just spread this out and i'm god has a plan and it may be another three-year loan it's all right if that's his plan i'm ready but i just want you to be aware because this will shock you i forgot i forgot i've been on the phone with the bank this week so i'll open this bill and it says do pay this amount 239 thousand 300 because of how hard covet hit him and they and he said this to me pastor shelley in the midst of all that in the midst of people closing down churches and us having this resell commercial property from churches it couldn't afford to keep it you all have paid over half of your balance he said god something's going on somebody's looking out he didn't say god but he believes he said somebody upstairs is looking out for you all somebody's helping you and i just wanted to tell you that and i want you to raise your hand toward this and i want you to ask the lord to his for his perfect will to be accomplished and it's going to be so wonderful to be out from under this and it might be before august 22nd might not be but it might be will you help me pray father in the name of the lord jesus christ i didn't mean to put a damper on what you've already done i just thought as a body we might have an opportunity to point our hand toward this paper as a point of contact and just say lord you're the same god you're the same god that helped us when we had to beg scrape and do everything to get a payment together you're the same god that showed up in march of 2021 and you begin to make a way where there seemed to be no way and you begin to pull finances from here and there and everywhere to begin to pull that loan down and down and down and down and lord i thank you that we're no longer facing a half a million dollar debt i thank you lord that you have given the victory to us and you have blessed the people now we just laid this back before you we just want you to know lord we trust you in all things and we know that you can make a way where there is no way whatever your plan is we're willing to walk it out but oh god we just feel faith to ask you lord we just feel faith to lift this up before you right now and say father would you supply this need according to your riches and glory and allow this church to come out from under this load we will give you praise we will give you honor we will give you glory our lord this is your business we're conducting and we thank you for every victory we thank you for making a way in the name of the lord jesus
