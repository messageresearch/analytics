[0:00] [Music]
[0:50] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and
[0:53] you're watching the Eagles cry I want to
[0:56] welcome you to the program today we are
[0:59] getting ready now for part three of a
[1:02] series that we have started on the
[1:04] process of spiritual adoption and we've
[1:08] already had a lot of fun teaching from
[1:10] Romans chapter 8 and guess what we're
[1:13] gonna go right back there again this
[1:15] week it's just so rich I think that is
[1:19] one of the richest chapters in the New
[1:21] Testament there are so many themes in
[1:23] Romans 8 that that awakened me that that
[1:26] really stirred up something within me
[1:29] and so I'm holding back a little bit
[1:31] because I mean I could take a half a
[1:34] verse of Romans eight and and speak all
[1:37] day because there's so many wonderful
[1:39] nuggets of truth there but we don't have
[1:42] that kind of time here on the television
[1:44] program if you've not contacted us to
[1:47] let us know that you're blessed by the
[1:49] Eagles cry would you take a look at the
[1:51] contact information that's given to you
[1:54] now on the screen and let us hear from
[1:56] you let us know that you are watching
[1:59] and if you have any prayer requests send
[2:02] them in we'd like to pray with you about
[2:04] your prayer requests and when God moves
[2:06] on your behalf and gives you the miracle
[2:08] you're after send us another email and
[2:11] let us know that God has answered prayer
[2:14] and we'll celebrate and rejoice with you
[2:16] there's one thing that we have come to
[2:18] know and that is God answers prayer he
[2:22] may not come when you want him to come
[2:24] but he's always right on time and he
[2:28] never fails and he doesn't always answer
[2:32] in the way that we want him to answer
[2:34] but he answers in a way that we know
[2:37] that it was him and that he is working
[2:40] all things out for our good so thank you
[2:42] for being a part of us praying for us
[2:45] and letting us help pray for you I just
[2:48] appreciate your faithful support of
[2:50] knowing that you're there and that
[2:53] you're praying we get emails sometime
[2:55] that say I never miss an episode and
[2:59] sometimes they'll tell us
[3:00] actually the time that they watch and
[3:03] and where they watch and I watch week
[3:05] after week and many times people will
[3:07] make a comment about one particular
[3:09] thing that was said or a theme to let me
[3:13] know that they were really watching and
[3:15] what program even or the subject matter
[3:18] of the series and that's just always a
[3:20] blessing so thank you so much let's get
[3:22] right into Romans chapter eight okay we
[3:25] left off in probably around verse 21
[3:30] because the creature itself also shall
[3:34] be delivered from the bondage of
[3:36] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[3:41] the children of God now ultimately we
[3:44] said this is speaking about the time of
[3:46] resurrection where our mortal body will
[3:49] put on immortality and and that which is
[3:52] of corruption will put on incorruption
[3:54] but also I believe it's speaking to us
[3:58] about overcoming the the limitations of
[4:05] this fleshly body there are some
[4:07] limitations because we're spirit beings
[4:10] that are living in an earthly body and
[4:12] there's just some things that this
[4:14] earthly body can't do but there is no
[4:17] limitation to what can be accomplished
[4:19] when your spirit man has come into union
[4:23] with the Spirit of God and I literally
[4:27] believe that the laws of the
[4:30] supernatural realm supersede the laws of
[4:33] the natural we see that all through the
[4:36] Bible we see men walking on water in the
[4:38] scripture we see iron axe heads floating
[4:42] in the stream we see a whole multitude
[4:45] of people fed with five loaves and and a
[4:50] few small fish we we see Jesus appearing
[4:55] to his disciples but not coming through
[4:57] the door we see the very Pete the very
[5:00] shadow of Peter healing the sick so
[5:04] there's some amazing miraculous
[5:06] occurrences in the Bible both Old
[5:09] Testament and New Testament now I know
[5:12] there are many who believe that those
[5:13] were
[5:14] Occulus occurrences are for that day
[5:16] they were Bible day things and we're
[5:20] never gonna see that again well I tell
[5:22] you I don't buy that I don't believe
[5:24] that at all because one of my favorite
[5:27] scriptures in the Bible says contrary to
[5:29] that Hebrews 13 and eight Jesus Christ
[5:32] the same yesterday and today and forever
[5:35] he changes not and what he was able to
[5:39] do when he walked the shores of Galilee
[5:41] he's still able to do that today and so
[5:45] I believe that this scripture is not
[5:47] only speaking about overcoming this body
[5:50] of corruption and when it's changed in
[5:53] the resurrection but I believe it's also
[5:55] speaking to us of being set free from
[5:57] the limitations of the fleshly body so
[6:00] that we can enter into the glorious
[6:02] liberty and freedom of the children of
[6:05] God verse 22 says for we know that the
[6:10] whole creation that's everything in
[6:12] creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
[6:15] together until now even the earthquakes
[6:19] and the volcanoes and the super storms
[6:23] of this century testify that all of
[6:27] creation is in birth pains and is
[6:31] groaning for the manifestation or the
[6:35] unveiling or the revealing the
[6:37] apocalypsis of the children of God the
[6:42] adopted sons of God hallelujah
[6:47] verse 23 and not only they not only
[6:50] creation but ourselves also which have
[6:55] the firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[7:00] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[7:03] for the adoption to wit the redemption
[7:08] of our body
[7:10] we're waiting on our adoption that will
[7:14] bring about that's what to wit means to
[7:17] bring about the redemption of our body
[7:22] so that we could overcome the
[7:24] limitations of this fleshly body now
[7:27] what does this mean
[7:27] verse 23 not only creation is groaning
[7:30] for the manifestation of the sons of God
[7:33] but we also as believers we're groaning
[7:35] we which have the firstfruits of the
[7:39] Spirit now you know I love the fact that
[7:43] everything that was in the Father he
[7:45] poured into the son and everything that
[7:47] was in the son the Lord Jesus Christ the
[7:50] Messiah he poured out upon the ecclesia
[7:53] the church on the day of Pentecost
[7:56] Shavuot and the same pillar of fire that
[8:01] led Moses and the children of Israel
[8:02] through the wilderness divided itself
[8:05] and appeared on the heads above the
[8:07] heads of the disciples in the upper room
[8:10] and Jesus said I will not leave you
[8:14] comfortless I will come to you and
[8:16] that's what he did on the day of
[8:17] Pentecost
[8:18] God Almighty came down in another form
[8:21] in the form of the Holy Spirit another
[8:23] manifestation another office not another
[8:26] person but another demonstration of the
[8:29] one true Living God here ye o Israel the
[8:34] Lord thy God is one but on the day of
[8:37] Pentecost we had another expression
[8:40] another manifestation or even another
[8:43] office if you want to call it that of
[8:45] God but what was it it was the same
[8:48] spirit that was in the Lord Jesus Christ
[8:51] it was the same spirit that overshadowed
[8:54] Mary and she conceived the Lord Jesus
[8:57] Christ so it's it's but and when we as
[9:01] believers have been washed in the blood
[9:04] sanctified by the word we've received
[9:06] the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[9:08] with the with evidence of gifts and
[9:11] tongues and and we have taught you here
[9:14] on the program that we believe that the
[9:16] ultimate evidence the ultimate fruit
[9:20] that someone has received the baptism of
[9:22] the Holy Spirit it's not speaking in
[9:24] tongues or gifts of the Spirit because
[9:26] it's possible to have those things and
[9:29] not have the fullness of the Spirit of
[9:31] God in your life we've seen that we've
[9:33] seen the counterfeit we know what can
[9:35] can happen out there but the true
[9:39] evidence is the
[9:40] the grace to live a life that is
[9:44] surrendered to every word of God I tell
[9:47] you the devil can imitate tongues he can
[9:49] imitate gifts he can imitate a revival I
[9:53] mean he can stir up people and have them
[9:55] all excited about things but there's one
[9:57] thing the devil can't do he cannot
[9:59] produce a life that is surrendered to
[10:02] the Word of God that's the evidence of
[10:05] the true baptism of the Holy Spirit and
[10:07] when we received I received the baptism
[10:09] of the Holy Spirit
[10:10] at the age of seven years old and it
[10:13] changed my life forever more I thought
[10:16] there couldn't be anything better than
[10:18] this this is this is God this is God in
[10:22] my body this is the Spirit of God living
[10:24] in me walking with me testifying that
[10:27] he's here
[10:28] that's what tongues is and it is it is
[10:31] biblical and it is for today to speak in
[10:34] tongues is a testimony that God's
[10:36] presence it's living inside of you and I
[10:39] believe in tongues and I believe in the
[10:41] gift of interpretation of tongues and I
[10:43] believe in prophecy and the gifts of
[10:46] healing and miracles and words of
[10:48] knowledge and wisdom and discerning of
[10:49] spirits
[10:50] I believe those gifts we need them but I
[10:53] know how the enemy can can imitate those
[10:56] kinds of things but he just can't live a
[10:58] godly surrendered life so that's our
[11:01] ultimate goal it's not to be able to
[11:03] prophesy more it's to be able to live
[11:05] more like Jesus but with all the
[11:08] fullness that we receive with all that
[11:10] greatness a great portion of God that we
[11:14] receive when we had the baptism of the
[11:17] Holy Spirit the Bible said that's just
[11:19] the earnest that's just the downpayment
[11:23] hallelujah that's just the deposit now
[11:28] in a real estate transaction when you
[11:31] are initiating a a contract to buy real
[11:35] estate many times the seller of the real
[11:39] estate will require that you put up a
[11:43] down payment but it's really not a down
[11:46] payment because the down payment is what
[11:49] you have to come up with when you're
[11:50] securing financing for the loan to pay
[11:53] for the property
[11:54] but they often require you to come up
[11:57] with what is called earnest money and
[12:00] that says it's held in what is called
[12:03] escrow it doesn't go to the seller right
[12:06] away it's usually held in an escrow
[12:08] account by the real-estate agency and
[12:10] what that says to the seller is I'm
[12:13] serious about my contract I'm not
[12:16] wasting your time I want you to know I'm
[12:19] putting up this earnest money to let you
[12:22] know that if you accept the terms of my
[12:25] contract and we can come to an agreement
[12:26] on such-and-such a date we will sit down
[12:30] sign the papers and you will be given a
[12:33] check for the remainder of the price the
[12:37] fullness of the price so when you get
[12:40] the earnest as a seller you only have a
[12:43] portion of the price that's coming to
[12:46] you and so if the Bible says that we
[12:49] have received the first fruits of the
[12:51] spirit or in other places it says the
[12:54] word earnest then we know that even
[12:57] after we have received the baptism of
[12:59] the Holy Spirit it's not over there's
[13:02] more of God to be had hallelujah I mean
[13:07] you're talking you're listening to a
[13:09] Pentecostal who received the baptism of
[13:12] the Holy Spirit and I thought I mean
[13:14] that was life what could be better and
[13:16] yet the Bible teaches us that when you
[13:19] have that experience there's more to be
[13:22] had there's more of God the deep calling
[13:26] to the deep but the noise of that
[13:28] waterspouts God wants to fill us with
[13:30] the fullness of the Spirit
[13:34] not just the earnest not just the
[13:35] firstfruits but the fullness and what is
[13:38] the fullness of the Holy Spirit of God
[13:41] it is adoption spiritual oneness
[13:46] spiritual adoption with God or by God
[13:50] and that's what this whole chapter is
[13:54] revealing we which have the firstfruits
[13:57] of the Spirit even we ourselves groan
[13:59] within ourselves and I'm telling you
[14:02] there is a groaning that's coming about
[14:04] in the spirit a longing a passionate
[14:07] deep cry god I've got to be filled with
[14:12] the fullness of your character I've got
[14:15] to be filled with the fullness of your
[14:18] spirit I want to walk in that place of
[14:21] authority in you so there is something
[14:27] groaning in us that can't be satisfied
[14:30] with the things of the world even we
[14:33] ourselves groan within ourselves we're
[14:36] in verse 23 waiting for the adoption to
[14:40] wit or that will bring us to the
[14:43] redemption of our body so it's it's by
[14:47] this revelation of spiritual adoption
[14:51] that we even come into a place of
[14:55] qualification for a resurrected body so
[15:00] you decide whether it's important or not
[15:02] if you want to have a body change one of
[15:05] these days then it is highly important
[15:09] very important that we come into that
[15:12] place of adoption and I want to make
[15:15] sure you understand that the adoption
[15:17] process and we'll talk about that in a
[15:20] moment it begins in the new birth but it
[15:22] doesn't end there so even if you're born
[15:25] again of the Spirit you've been
[15:26] justified by faith wash by the water of
[15:29] the word we go through this little thing
[15:30] again filled with the precious Holy
[15:32] Spirit of God you still have not come to
[15:36] the fullness of adoption now I know many
[15:38] churches denominations and so forth
[15:40] seminaries and theologians will say well
[15:43] that's adoption that's all there is to
[15:44] it
[15:45] well I can show you from the Word of God
[15:47] there's more to it than that so let's
[15:49] keep looking
[15:50] keep reading and keep studying in this
[15:53] series because I believe God wants to do
[15:55] some more verse 24 says for we are saved
[15:59] by hope but hope that is seen is not
[16:03] hope for what a man see if why don't
[16:06] they yet hope for but if we hope for
[16:09] that we see not think about this then do
[16:13] we with patience wait for it we're
[16:16] hoping for the fullness of adoption that
[16:19] has not yet been revealed
[16:21] we can wait for it with patience now I
[16:24] have a confession to make
[16:25] sometimes I get a little impatient
[16:27] because I'm ready to see the work of God
[16:30] finished in the earth I'm ready to see
[16:33] the kingdom of God established on planet
[16:36] Earth it's getting ugly out there it's
[16:39] getting dark out there
[16:41] hatred is rising and and it's bad on the
[16:45] world scene things are not getting
[16:47] better
[16:48] and we there's not been change yet
[16:53] except change for the band
[16:55] everywhere we look but we keep waiting
[16:58] with hope because we know that the sons
[17:01] of God are about to arise the church if
[17:04] you want to say the church I don't I
[17:06] don't often use that expression when I'm
[17:09] speaking about these terms because the
[17:11] church is what we what I think of when I
[17:16] think of Church you may think of the
[17:18] body of Christ when I think of church
[17:20] unfortunately I usually think of of what
[17:23] man has made it and and we're when you
[17:27] think of church you may be thinking of
[17:28] the church it was born on the day of
[17:30] Pentecost that which God established in
[17:32] the beginning but where is that church
[17:35] we're looking for that church where is
[17:37] that ecclesia where is that fellowship
[17:39] of believers that are doing it today
[17:41] like it was done in the book of Acts I
[17:43] don't know where that exists it's only
[17:46] in token form but we're coming to a
[17:49] place of harvest where we are going to
[17:52] see an emergence of a company of
[17:56] believers who operate in the same
[17:58] spiritual power and authority that we
[18:01] read about in the book of Acts Oh
[18:02] hallelujah
[18:04] so I just wanted to sort of help you
[18:09] understand the the term and why I'm
[18:11] saying body and bride and overcomers and
[18:13] sons of God and so forth because I
[18:16] believe that in every church there will
[18:19] be some who are called to this some are
[18:24] feeling that deep call and and who are
[18:27] not satisfied with with just the form
[18:29] they're not satisfied with just what
[18:32] they've been doing all these years
[18:34] perhaps you've heard me say before if
[18:36] you always do what you've always done
[18:38] then you'll always be what you've always
[18:41] been and there's a cry in my spirit that
[18:44] says I don't want to be what I've always
[18:46] been I want to be more for God not for
[18:50] me but for God verse 26 said likewise
[18:54] the spirit also helpeth our infirmities
[18:57] that's good news for we know not what we
[19:01] should pray for as we ought but the
[19:04] spirit itself maketh intercession for us
[19:08] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[19:11] and that word uttered literally means
[19:13] which cannot be understood and he that
[19:17] searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the
[19:20] mind of the Spirit because he maketh
[19:24] intercession for the Saints according to
[19:27] the will of God so when you don't know
[19:30] how to pray that's one of the reasons
[19:33] why the gift of the Spirit was given so
[19:36] that he could pray through us because
[19:40] the spirit itself always knows the mind
[19:44] of God so the Spirit will pray through
[19:48] you the mind of God
[19:49] why is that so important because it cuts
[19:53] out selfish ambition it cuts out soulish
[19:58] prayers it keeps us from manipulating
[20:02] God when the spirit prays through us he
[20:06] always prays the will of God and so I
[20:09] tell people you need to pray until you
[20:11] come into a place that you can pray in a
[20:14] heavenly language or with groanings that
[20:16] cannot be understood because much is
[20:19] accomplished you're bypassing your mind
[20:21] you're bypassing your will you're
[20:24] bypassing your soul and and the Holy
[20:28] Spirit is crying out to God from your
[20:31] spirit and this is an amazing gift that
[20:35] God has given the New Testament church
[20:37] this wasn't available in the Old
[20:39] Testament this was given to them into
[20:41] the New Testament believer of which I'm
[20:44] a part of that and I believe you're
[20:46] called to that so if you've never
[20:49] experience that gift you need the gift
[20:51] because once you get it that's just the
[20:53] earnest there's more where that came
[20:56] from
[20:57] hallelujah alright so because he maketh
[21:02] intercession the spirit for the Saints
[21:04] according to the will of God now
[21:06] everybody knows this verse but we have
[21:08] to be reminded of it sometime and we
[21:11] know that all things somebody say all
[21:13] things we know that all things work
[21:16] together for good to them that love God
[21:18] if it doesn't feel like it even if it
[21:22] doesn't look like it even if it doesn't
[21:24] smell like it even if it doesn't sound
[21:26] like it all things work together for
[21:29] good to them that love God that's me to
[21:35] them who are the called according to his
[21:37] purpose that's me that's you for whom he
[21:42] did foreknow he also did predestinate to
[21:45] be conformed to the image of his son
[21:48] that he might be the firstborn among
[21:51] many brethren now this is a very
[21:54] important truth that is being revealed
[21:58] here God in his foreknowledge knew our
[22:02] choice and by his knowledge of our
[22:06] choice he predestinated us to be
[22:09] conformed to the image of his son so
[22:13] that Jesus the son might be the
[22:17] firstborn among many brethren now that
[22:23] speaks of sonship that speaks of
[22:27] adoption Jesus paid the price
[22:32] walked the walk talked the talk won the
[22:36] victory over death hell and the grave so
[22:39] that you and I could fellowship him in
[22:42] his sufferings receive the glory that is
[22:46] to be revealed
[22:47] in us and ultimately be a manifested
[22:53] resurrected son of God because if
[22:56] there's firstfruits there's got to be
[22:59] the rest of a harvest
[23:01] if one son is the firstfruits of those
[23:06] who will be sons where are the other
[23:08] sons where is the rest well that's what
[23:13] we're contending for that's what we're
[23:15] believing for that's what we're hearing
[23:18] God revealed in this hour by the spirit
[23:21] the sons of God are arising those hungry
[23:25] passionate loving warriors those who are
[23:30] given the anointing to overcome the sons
[23:33] of the kingdom are racing up in this
[23:36] hour desperately tired of mundane
[23:41] Christianity and desiring relationship
[23:46] abba papa father god relationship drawn
[23:51] up under the arm of Almighty God and
[23:54] loved until you become like him this is
[23:58] what the scripture is talking about and
[24:01] it gives us so much hope to know that if
[24:04] Jesus lived among us lived in the earth
[24:08] was tempted in all manner like we are
[24:11] yet without sin and he overcame and he
[24:14] said little children I've overcome the
[24:16] world
[24:16] and I'm price he told us I'm praying for
[24:18] you he said to Peter I'm praying for you
[24:22] and I believe he's pet praying for us
[24:26] interceding for us as well that we will
[24:28] also overcome
[24:30] moreover verse 30 the last verse that
[24:33] we're going to read in Romans 8 moreover
[24:35] whom he also called excuse me whom he
[24:39] also whom he predestined he would get it
[24:42] right in a moment
[24:43] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[24:47] he also called and whom he called them
[24:52] he also justified and whom he justified
[24:55] them he also glorified that settles it
[25:01] the Word of God says so it's all a part
[25:06] of God's divine plan for you and I
[25:11] especially this last generation those of
[25:14] us who are
[25:15] now in the most exciting time the
[25:18] consummation of the ages evil is
[25:21] maturing and so are the sons of God
[25:25] evil is maturing the spirit of
[25:28] lawlessness the spirit of iniquity the
[25:31] spirit of Antichrist is maturing the
[25:35] sons of the wicked one are maturing and
[25:39] so are the sons of God there's about to
[25:43] be an ultimate showdown on Mount Carmel
[25:47] spiritually speaking God is going to
[25:51] show himself strong and this time he's
[25:54] going to do it through those who trust
[25:57] in him those manifested adopted sons of
[26:02] God now when we look here in Romans
[26:05] chapter 8 at this word adoption it's
[26:10] translated from two Greek words one of
[26:14] which is the word huse in greek it means
[26:19] mature sons and it is also translated
[26:25] from another word two words put together
[26:28] the first word huo's which means mature
[26:32] sons and the second word being thesis
[26:35] perhaps you've heard that word used for
[26:37] college or university which means
[26:40] placing so if you read the word adoption
[26:44] in the New Testament it means the
[26:48] placing the positioning the setting in
[26:52] order of maturer sons not little babies
[26:59] crying to get their way but the setting
[27:03] in order the placing of mature sons so
[27:07] this could be translated the placing of
[27:10] mature sons or a shorter version sonship
[27:13] sonship is being revealed we're going to
[27:17] have to end now part three and I want
[27:21] you to tune in again next time for part
