morning for the life that's behind the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah oh yes it's the life you may be seated just a moment we're so happy to see you in the house of the Lord and his presence is here and uh you know I I just was looking around the room this morning and of course there's some missing and God sent some extra visitors in here to make up for that and we appreciate that so much but I was just thankful I just felt some overwhelming thankfulness to be able to Pastor a group of people I've been streaming some other services lately is trying to take the temperature of what's happening in other places because God's moving everywhere everywhere his bride is gathered together he's moving but it makes me very very thankful for you I want you to know that I'm very very thankful for you I'm thankful because I see so many worship services around the the world where where the song leader does all the singing doesn't that make it a concert I'm so thankful to have a group of people who sing you know you're building an atmosphere for the Lord to come in and help you you're you're you're doing it to glorify him but but there's a little element of that that's just slightly self-serving because when we build an atmosphere of Faith around our lives he'll come and speak to our needs is that right so I know we have various uh forms genres of music We Sing old hymns we sing newer pray I'm not one of those who believes that if a song was written uh in the past 30 years that it's not good I happen to believe that the same anointing that was anointing songwriters in the 50s is still anointing songwriters today and just because it doesn't appear in the only believe book doesn't mean you know there's nothing there's no church order on that particularly and I like the fact that I I look around and I see the seniors and they're singing with the same enthusiasm a newer song with the same worship making out the words when we can get them up fast enough and not not judging the song or you know just entering in and and I want to thank you that the worship leader here doesn't have to constantly Tell You Raise Your Hands Say Amen praise the Lord you've come for that that is why we've come we've come to hear the word but we have come to worship the King of Kings and the Lord of lords that's why we were here I don't want to say this for the visitors we we should keep this quiet but this is why we were here four and a half hours last Sunday don't panic we got it out we got it out we may not have to be here before today let me say something else my blood pressure is not up I know my face is red and I know that there will be home remedies sent to me on stream brother Shelley your blood pressure's up again I'm sunburned and it happened before I realized it was happening uh the only time that I am completely pain-free is when I'm asleep and I don't know I have some pain in my sciatic or when I'm standing in the swimming pool now that may sound worldly to you but you'll get over it uh so what I did yesterday was I stood and I sit sometime but yesterday I stood for two hours in the swimming pool with my phone streaming preaching and I was so blessed but it happened so quickly and I said to my family later do I look red is my face to oh no you look at my man maybe a little red but not too much and then I go to bed last night and my cheeks are swelled up from so this was not I didn't try to get a handsome or you know I uh brother man brother Ram said you don't have a little color you know I'm not trying to get color particularly but you don't have to be pale to be holy I'll tell you that right now anyway uh oh Oh Sister Jaya you know God blessed some with permanent Sun tans oh this is going to be one of those Sundays and we have visitors too oh my

anybody it wasn't intentionally our fellowship meeting our quarterly fellowship meeting will be uh Saturday night August the 5th and the 6th we will follow our regular schedule we will have a fellowship meal and and young people fun in the afternoon on Saturday service at six o'clock on Saturday evening and then Sunday morning at 11 with lunch to follow under the tent and we don't know who

the 8th let me say it again October 3rd through the 8th and I'll mention also again that if you uh forget the dates you can go on the app um one more little note here for for social media is we uh Facebook has reached out to tell us that we are trending a little bit and uh they're noticing some uh some traffic on our social media and for a short amount of time we're going to be monetized what that means is Facebook will give a fractions of pennies believe me they're not going to pay much fractions of pennies for every like and every comment and every share that we get on our Facebook Ministry and so uh all of you can help us get a a head start by liking and commenting and sharing and uh if it's something you don't like don't like it we're not forcing you to like or if you don't want to share if you're ashamed of where you go to church don't dare share it I wouldn't want you to do that um but if you feel like you'd like to we have some tremendous posts every day just about and uh really thought provoking post and we're gaining followers we have 6 100 followers on Facebook and that's a quite an improvement in the last little while and we're growing on Instagram and there's a lot of work that goes into it of which I have have very little to do with but we have great folks God God is using the staff and uh sister Anna Christine has come on to start helping some well last end of last year I think it was and it has been a tremendous boost and it's a it's an Outreach we're not trying to build something up but except we just want people to to experience the reality of God the goodness of God and we're not ashamed of the message that we believe we post it we want people to know and the more people who pull away the more we want to pull in and so thank you for what you do all of you and thank you for liking and sharing and commenting because it will be a uh it'll be kind of a test run I think what they're doing is looking for those um pages that are that are generating some activity and and really it's to God be the glory do you understand it's just to God be the glory I know we've had a lot of music but there was no special song turned in and just helped me the lord gave me this song to write about oh I don't know 30 years ago probably now almost [Music] what key is that gee well I used to do it in G but I used to be 35 hmm you think I can I just a moment doesn't that seem a little high I was standing on a mountain I was looking toward the sky when I saw storm approaching and I feared that I would die oh I saw God's creatures run run and seek a better place to hide I heard the Thunder Rolls rolled down in my soul then I bow my head and cry now the clouds were moving faster and the lightning Flash ing bright and the clouds grew so dark they hid the light of the sun and it seemed that it was night open all at once there was a Feeling like I'd never had before and up above that storm you should have heard me sing God had given me he goes we we know it's so sing it with me so spread your wings [Music] and fly [Music] oh you weren't born to live down in that Valley you were born to soar through Sky don't let your trials bring you down or drive your spirit Lord the ground up with wings little ego and fly all at once his spirit [Music] high above it all you know I never even had to move my wings the Holy Spirit he had

singers and the cameraman and the sound men and the projector lady and everything that you're doing God bless all of you God bless you Brother Juan from from Cape Town thank you God bless you all from Ghana and and across this nation from Iceland and we're going to be praying for brother Hawk and Sister Mary Beth at the end of the service and their children as they'll be leaving tomorrow for a month in Iceland to be used of the Lord in whatever way he would desire to use them and then God willing if everything comes together for us we will be leaving in a couple weeks to join them and my wife and I will spend a couple weeks there doing some Ministry work and enjoying the beauty of Iceland I don't know it's about my ninth trip or something like that I'm not sure exactly how many but it's a wonderful place where there's a small group of Believers that love the Lord and love the word it's the strangest thing in all the world here's the people that don't generally have televisions in their home and and the only Christian Network in Iceland is owned by a message believer and God's using that he's using that he's used it many times through the years and this truth has been presented through the years and we don't know what all God's going to do but he's going to do some amazing things yet in the ministry in Iceland do you believe that I believe that with all my heart you all have met brother Erickson most of you have and and you know that he's a man of integrity in a man that loves the word and God's using him and so let's be sure to remember to pray for them and I I won't take time to to mention the rest of the streamers but they're all over the world thank you so much for being with us Exodus chapter 16. beginning in verse 2. are you ready for the word and the whole Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness and the children of Israel said unto them what did God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt when we sat by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to the full for ye have brought us forth into this Wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger then said the Lord unto Moses behold I will reign bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day that I may prove them whether they will walk in my law or no now would you go to Exodus chapter 17 let me read one more place and then you can have your seat eight verses and all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the Wilderness of sin after their Journeys according to the Commandment of the Lord and pitched in rephedim and there was no water for the people to drink so they hungered for bread and God provided bread didn't he do it and now they're thirsty they need something to wash the bread down with it seems and so they are they're again in need wherefore the people did chide with Moses and said give us water that we may drink and Moses said unto them why chide ye with me they weren't just requesting moisture they were mockingly pressing him and agitating him are you going to help me they they were you know on his on his hand like we were speaking of Tuesday night just coming back and back give us water that we may drink and Moses said unto them why child ye with me wherefore do ye tempt the Lord and the people thirsted there for water and the people murmured against Moses and said wherefore is this that thou Hast brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with Earth weren't they just asking to die now they're upset because they're thirsty and Moses Cried unto the Lord saying what shall I do unto this people they'd be almost ready to Stone me and the Lord said unto Moses go on before the people and take with thee of the Elders of Israel and thy rod wherewith thou smodus the river take in thine hand and go behold I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb and thou shall Smite The Rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and Moses did so in the sight of the Elders of Israel Smite The Rock and what happened the water began to flow out of the rock he called the name of the place Masa and maribba because of the chiding of the children of Israel and because they tempted the Lord saying is the Lord among us or not then came amalek and fought with Israel in referedim now Lord we thank you for your word today you have told us in the newer Covenant in the New Testament that everything that happened to Israel happened as in samples to us there is much that we who are the partakers of Grace can understand by looking at those who were under the law so Lord we asked today that you anoint our ears to hear your word and that you anoint your servant to give forth your word as for your word it is Anointed it is life it is truth it is God it is the written record of who you are and so now Lord we ask that any hindrance would be put down among us even now and that there would be Liberty to deliver what you have placed on my heart and I will thank you and this people will praise you for your special Grace To Us in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the church said amen you may be seated we were speaking recently about transitioning from one phase to another phase I don't know if you remember it's been a few weeks ago now we we talked about this John excuse me Revelation chapter 10 where John is told to eat the book now if anybody needs to understand the metaphor it means he was told to take that scroll and to eat it and and he did and uh I don't want to say if it was physical or spiritual but what I do know is that exactly what the Lord spoke to him would happen the angel said is exactly what happened it was sweet in his mouth like honeycomb and then it moved down into his belly and it gave him bitter belly syndrome do you understand what I'm saying his stomach began to boil just as soon as that word began to go down that scroll began to go down and he began to digest what was in that open book that open scroll and so we understand that when things begin to move around in the stomach something is going to happen and the next verse says to John and you must do what prophesy again for what you have taken into your spirit man your your spiritual womb it's now stirring in you there's some bitterness involved it's going to cost you something to eat the revealed word let me just say it's going to cost you something to eat this scroll the revelation of Jesus Christ is a costly meal amen the church doesn't want much to do with it because it's not necessarily politically correct and it's not necessarily Granny's Doctrine because even our precious grannies could have had it wrong but we don't have to have it wrong in our day because God sent a word he sent a message amen and we're not looking today to the forerunning prophet we're looking today to the forerunning message come on because it's a now I know that there is an element of Truth when people say you can't separate the messenger from the message I understand the element of what they're saying but I also know that a messenger is a sinner saved by grace it wasn't a Heavenly angel that we're hearing from although it sort of really was but he had an Earthly mouthpiece amen and I heard somebody explain it so beautifully yesterday when he was talking about having a perfect balance I was listening at this little brother preach and he was talking about having a perfect balance and he said in order to have a perfect balance in in the word you'd have to be perfected and he said so not just the inner part of who you are but even there would have to be some perfection in your flesh so we can say that the only one I'm just quoting another little preacher now he said we could say that the only perfect balance in the word was what was represented by the Lord Jesus Christ because any time a man a sinner saved by grace begins to to speak then there's that element of opinion that can sometimes come in now thank God we're not counting on opinion now we have the saith the Lord do you believe that so we don't have to wonder about how to get out of here the way has been made very clear the Lord Jesus Christ has been unveiled before us in the word and we are thankful for the messenger and we are thankful for the message our focus in this hour is not to be the messenger our focus in this hour is to be the message because it was the message that was to forerun the the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ there can't be a message without a messenger I don't know if you remember this or not but the spirit of the Lord spoke to us some years ago and I recently heard sister elfrida mention and he took us in a series of dates and he took us to December the 24th 1965. and I said in this experience I know exactly what that is that is the day of brother branham's death and I was corrected in that experience and I was told that it was indeed the end of one man Ministry you see there'll never be another one man come on the scene to have the ministry of Jesus Christ in the earth that was the end of a real era talk about a a real uh cycle it came to an end then the prophet tells us over and over again that all throughout history God uses one man in a generation I believe because of the word of the Lord that that ended in the in December of 1965 when the last one-man Ministry was removed from the earth and so now we have Ministry but it's not from one man it's a many membered body it's a bride Ministry is anybody following what I'm saying it's a corporate body coming together underneath that word and like John who was a type of the Bride in Revelation chapter 10 we will also be required to eat the book so keep eating this message I know there are many things out there to capture our attention but don't you neglect to hear the word of the hour don't neglect to hear the message of the hour it's life to us I'm waiting on you to help me now and building a foundation for something but I'm not going too far if you won't get with me now now we've got to have that there's transforming power as we sit under that message it changes our life it reorders our steps it is a guide to us thankfully we have the Holy Ghost as our God but that word also serves us as a God to keep us out of the ditches because it's a middle of the road that this bride is walking amen not extreme to the right not extreme to the left we're seeking the middle of the road which is taking the message of the hour right back to the Bible right back to the word if you hear something that doesn't go right back to the word don't be critical leave it God will help us to understand it later but when you can take this message and lay it right within the pages of God's word you have all the ammunition you need to defeat the enemy in this day hello you see that's why God sent it to us to open our eyes that we might really have relationship with Jesus Christ this message didn't come to give us a head knowledge of Jesus no siree this message came to so unveil him and make him so real before us that we can become one with him if you think I'm just talking off my hat I'll come back in a moment with a quote then those of you who haven't amen yet you can amen we won't leave here till we get everybody involved all right now I want to go to another reading it's a little bit of a long reading you'll have to forgive me for that it's Numbers Chapter 20. and it begins in verse two I want to make sure we get a lot of this we're we have as I started to say uh we were talking about the transition between the bitter belly syndrome of eating this word and it getting in there it's costing us something some of the family don't want to talk to us anymore some people call us a cult it gets a little bitter down in there it's painful sometimes folks on our job look at us funny and some people say you follow a dead man and they've got all kinds of things and it gets a little bitter sometime you have to stand against the uh maybe the trinitarian thing or the or the or the title baptism thing and it gets a little difficult sometimes but you just let it digest you you don't get don't you dare turn away from it you just let it you that's the work of the holy spirit it's going to be sometimes sweet in your mouth that's when you hear it that's when you first start eating it when it starts changing the way you have to live your life it gets bitter in the belly but that's only two phases there's another phase and that third phase is prophesy again and I believe as brother Branham told us that's not just John that's being called on to release that word it's a broad Ministry to release that word we're not all preachers but we're all called to live by this book and our lives preach Our Lives testify of the truth that we've been changed by if you believe that same man all right verse verse 2 and there was no water for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and the people chode with Moses and and spake saying what God that he would have died when I that we had died when our Brethren died before the Lord and why have you bro haven't we heard this already this seems to be the same old song the children of Israel were quite fond of this song weren't they they're just singing it over and over again and why have you brought us up the congregation of the Lord into this Wilderness that we and our cattle should die there and wherefore have ye made us to come out of Egypt to bring us in unto this evil place it is no place of seed or a figs or a vines or of pomegranates neither is there any water to drink or they're building their case and Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly under the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation that's good advice for any minister when you can't please the people just go into the presence of the Lord and let him help you amen so they went into the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation and they fell upon their faces and guess what the glory the kavod the heavy presence of God his glory appeared unto them and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod and gather thou the assembly together thou and Aaron thy brother and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock now you know he's already done this he's already brought water from the rock but the last time Moses was told to take that rod and strike The Rock and God allowed water to come have you ever seen water coming out of a solid rock this is miraculous this is Supernatural this is God typing what was going to come at Calvary this is pointing to Something Beautiful in the future when Redemption is paid for and so this is not something new God has already before allowed water to come out of the rock but but this time Moses is told you take that rod and gather the people together but when it comes time to to get water you're not going to strike The Rock you're going to transition we hear about the Branham telling us so often if God has is ever going to do something he said you look back and see how God has done it in the past because how God has done it in the past he will always do it that way I fully understand what he's teaching don't you but I also understand that there are times of transition when God is building up to something else there is a crescendo that is taking place there is a consummation that is taking place and everything is gathering together in one moment we could even say that we're in a place like that as the little bride of Jesus Christ right now we're living in a world that's about to implode it's hard to get people to amen when you're talking about destruction but we're living in a world that's about to implode so the bride is at a very pivotal and important position in this hour and we're going to have to be very careful how we walk out the Future Days of our life we're going to understand that what we have gotten by with in the past we may not get by with in this hour the compromise that we have picked up along the way that God has allowed us just to go on we may not be able to compromise the same way in this hour we may have to come back to what the prophet said he said you've gone as far with God as you're ever going to go until you're willing to pay a greater price when we see so many Among Us picking up the world and seemingly sliding back into worldly things we can't look at them because we're not called to look at the church we're called to look at the Christ we can't look at them but what we can do is learn from their mistake we're not here to criticize them but we're here to learn and we might have to say Lord I want every bit of compromise out of my life I want everything out of my life that that is hindering me from the fullness of what your promise is to my life I think we may be in one of those transitioning moments do you follow me I think we may be in one of those from bitter belly to prophesy again we may be in another transition we may be coming out of of striking the Rock and we may be coming up to to an hour where we're called to speak to the rock you see the rock never has to be smitten again once was enough help me preach once was enough it never has to be smitten or stricken again it's already happened but there's something that follows that and that's what that's what God is revealing to Moses right here he said uh speak unto the rock before their eyes and it shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock is that what it said so Thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink and Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he commanded him and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and this is the rocket Horeb and he said unto them here now ye Rebels wow that's a little rough I've never been tempted too many times don't you have a heart for pastors [Music] that was so sad yeah Lord help them bless him Jesus folks this is a serious thing now we don't just need to pray for our own and you definitely need to pray for your own you need to pray for your pastor you need to pray for your associate pastor but we need to pray for pastors around this truth all over the world because they're in the middle of a bunch of stuff there's a lot going on and we're going to try not to come to the pulpit and say here now ye Rebels we're going to try to say brothers and sisters but Moses said here now ye Rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock and Moses lifted up his hand and with his Rod he not only smote The Rock once but he smote The Rock twice the prophet tells us that he threw the whole story of redemption out of cater it was a dangerous thing that Moses did he was gambling with his own eternity did you know it was that serious now God had mercy on him but he was gambling with his own position when he took this into his own hand and not only did he not speak to the Rock but he smoked the rock two times and guess what God did he honored his word he honored his prophet [Music] he honored the faith of the people even though they were being a bit rebellious and water began to come out abundantly and the congregation drank and the camels and the cattle and everything all the beasts were able to find water and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because ye believed me not this is serious words to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them this was sad news here two lives dedicated to bringing the children of God into the land of promise but because the instructions of the Lord were not followed to the letter when God is speaking here he's not speaking in general terms he's speaking meticulously he's speaking specifically how I want it done now I'm going to send the water but I want you this time to speak to the Rock and Moses is standing there thinking about had all I can take and he raises up that Rod he's supposed to have the rod God told him to use the rod but not to strike to speak this time and he dared not only strike but he struck two different times two separate individual times and it got him in some pretty big trouble he said you didn't sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them and this is the water of meribah because the children of Israel strove with the Lord and he was Sanctified in them I want you to go to experiences this is about as far back as you can go 1947. brother Branham said the church has failed I wonder what he would say about the church at large today 2023 2023 in 1947 he's saying the church has failed see instead of bringing the people together as one body it separated them out you see God wasn't pleased with this denominational idea God was looking to have one body not a divided body his body is not divided God is one amen he can't be chopped into pieces and God was looking for a people that couldn't be chuffed into pieces he said look how he Compares it here he's talking about if you go back he's talking about the different churches the different denominations the different ideas and and look what he Compares it to he said just like Moses instead of speaking to the Rock he smote The Rock and it failed now we know water came so it wasn't the method that failed because the Bible tells us that water came but there was a problem and the problem fell on Moses he said so the church will never take the people over Jordan and may I add neither did Moses all right this was the price that Moses had to pay so brother Branham says the church will never take the people over that's right but now God has changed his order that's kind of important to note and he's sending back you who mark my word there's Great Men on the road to this world that's right there's great powers on the road to this world he's talking about they're coming up now there's great powers on the road to this world and I want you all to read the next sentence I want you to work a little bit read the next sentence in yellow and and because it's speaking about an hour where the one-man Ministry has ended and it's it's not many people gathering around one man anymore do you understand it's now about a bride of sons it's about a company of Overcomers it's it's about a people that have been tried and tested but have come forth like gold in the last hour and it'll be a people that'll call out a people not just a prophet calling out a people but a people that'll call out a people and he said Remember come out of her my people this is this is something we're very familiar with come out of her my people he said is that right Babylon confusion and not the people now not out of your churches but come out of that confusion among you you see now listen to what he said he said come out let's serve God this would be good for us this was 1947 but it'd still be all right for today I believe it would be seems to be a word based uh statement here he said come out let's serve god with one heart no division among us we're serving God with one heart with one mind and one Accord he said is that right and then look what God will do God God will take this his church God will take his church over Jordan [Music] you see Moses didn't get to do it my I'm not getting the help I need this morning I'm sorry I don't want to sound like a pouty preacher especially when I'm preaching on this but I I'm feeling like I'm feeling a little something stirring and I need a little extra help and I'm asking for it oh you Silent Ones come out let's serve god with one heart one mind and one Accord is that right he said and then God God God you can't look to Moses to do it now because Moses wasn't allowed to go in he said God don't worry God will take his church over Jordan we hear so many people talking about the news in 1965 I've just sat on the podcast where sister Alfreda was giving her testimony and and so it's kind of still stirring in my in my mind and and here she was relatively new to the message at that time the time that brother Branham was about to leave the scene she's just heard one one series of meetings and then she begins to to hear tapes and she knows that once she has been to Phoenix and has heard brother Branham in that series of meetings she'll no longer be able to go back to the little to the little rescue mission where she had been attending church she'd come out of the German Baptist Church and into the Pentecostal church but the little Pentecostal Church happened to have a woman pastor so now she's gone down she's heard this uh uh prophet and she's seen these things you'll hear it in the podcast she was there when Bishop Stanley helped brother Branham because brother Branham had just been given a new Bible and the pages of his Bible were sticking together and he got in a little bit of a panic anybody would he's standing in front of all those people the the International Convention the Full Gospel businessman's Fellowship and he got a little nervous and and Bishop Stanley dressed like a priest he comes uh forward and and touches brother branham's arm and speaks to him step Be steady and I'm paraphrasing now God's doing something you you're nervous and and but God is doing something something is happening in this moment and she saw that she was in that service is that right she was in that service and then they left the next morning or some sometime quite right after that and she was not in the service where brother Branham was given about a half an hour it wasn't his speaking he wasn't to speak in that service he was supposed to have even moved on but he stayed and they gave him about 30 minutes to speak a little bit about what had transpired and it looked like God and then we have the sermon that he preached some months later where he called it this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears okay what month was the what month was the meetings there that you attended in January of 65. and so in December of the same Year brother Branham is gone so here she is just feasting on the tapes because now they're passing the tapes around Edmonton and they're they're hearing them and and the people are realizing we can't go back to our Pentecostal mission and we can't go back to just a German Baptist we've got to go on with the word don't you appreciate somebody don't you appreciate somebody who hears the eagle cry and says I can't go back to where I was because there's more for me the call of the spirit that says there's something more for us and it's not convenient it's not like it is today that that all I have to do is go here and I hear any message I want to hear right here we're talking about a day of the reel to real I'm assuming yes reel to real well first of all the players this big you don't put a reel-to-reel recorder in your pocket you put in the trunk of your car so that's got to be hauled and and and brother random was no short preacher you know he was long-winded like like others I know and he had a lot more to say I get it and so one real wouldn't do it so you're talking about sometimes for reals of a Sunday service and they had to to find whose house we're going to meet at and they had to drag that old tape player and drag those tapes around and they were hard to get it wasn't like you can just go on the internet and pull them down you had one copy and they passed that copy and now one year has transpired in her testimony and he's gone now to some of you who don't understand the ministry that means nothing to you but you who understand the ministry that he had you understand how heartbreaking that would be because he was speaking about things that were to come don't tell me he wasn't he was speaking about things that were to come and now he's gone and the people couldn't figure out how do how do we it must have been like the disciples and I hope I don't offend you with my analogy here but it must have been like the disciples here's a messiah whose teaching and preaching about the kingdom coming and then they see him crucified and laid in a tomb and their hearts are broken here's a prophet messenger who comes to tie together the Loose Ends of all the other messages and now he's gone and before he leaves he prophesies and he teaches and he preaches of things to come and he tells it as though he's going to physically participate in these things to come and so the people are trying to figure out and and those of you who've been around this long enough you know all the crazy uh crazy ideas that came out of this you know and the airplane that's rusted just a a pile of rusted bolts out there in in the in the wilderness waiting on waiting on the day that it needs to be restored to carry brother Branham from place to place and the money for the tent and these are not just pieces of Gossip these are things that through the years we've come to know not come to speculate but come to know amen I was even invited I didn't have a time to make the to make the trip but I was even invited don't you want to come and see the airplane because there's no way in the world that these things are going to be able to come to pass in the absence of the Prophet the disciples must have felt the same way there's no way that God's going to be able to birth a church [Music] that establishes a kingdom with the Messiah not on the scene but I want to tell you God had a plan he was about to transfer that anointing from one man to 120. and 120 to 3 000 not the call of the Prophet not the office of the Prophet not the minute we're not talking about the ministry we're talking about the fruit of the ministry we're talking about Holy Ghost [Applause] so so it went from one Jesus you see you've got to know what the Holy Ghost baptism is it's not a piece of him it's him it's him it's deity when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the very life of God is walking around in your shoe leather isn't that right and so it went from one Jesus to a multiplication just like we were taught one seed goes into the ground and a harvest comes up am I out of the word here am I telling you the truth one seed goes in didn't the bible say that Jesus was the firstborn among many brethren if that's the case then we could come to the hour we live again and we could say that the way God used brother Branham was one man to the age but the truth that he brought the way he introduced the people to Jesus Christ we can say that was like one seed and many sons to follow but it was hard to see that it was hard for sister Alfred it was hard for brothers it was hard for so many people how can these things come to pass in the physical absence of the Prophet but didn't God do it that way before so really we shouldn't maybe they shouldn't have been sold but that's what happens sometime when everything hangs on one man this is not criticism we're talking about a Ministry that had not been seen in the earth since the days of John the Baptist in the Lord Jesus Christ we're not talking about just a little Pentecostal story we're talking about opening up of the seals we're talking about the mysteries of God coming to a finish hello that's just the book I'm just talking from the book and now the the messenger's gone so who's going to explain the rest you know it didn't really need further explanation it really just needed demonstration it really just needed manifestation didn't it it just really needed to come to pass because there's one thing you need to know if there's anything that you need to know and you don't know you will know because you're his if there's anything that has to be made real to you and it hasn't been made real to you yet hold on because if you're part of that elected bride there'll be no Rapture without you [Applause] because you become one with that word and the same holy ghost that helps you helps your neighbor there will help you if you keep your eyes on the Sun remember we preached last Sunday don't look at the church don't look at any church don't look at other message searches don't look at your church because there's flesh in all of them there's mistakes in all of them yes you get your eyes on people you won't feel you won't see that manifestation of the truth in you but you get your eyes on the son don't matter what the storm is doing do you hear the song doesn't matter what the storm is doing around you you get your eyes on Jesus just get your eyes on Jesus someone said I can't figure all this out I don't know how to put all these things you're talking about terms that I don't know anything about well just stick around don't be scared off stick around because we have a determination to keep our eyes on Jesus and if we do he'll lead us all the way you see there's got to be a people who recognize when the pillar of fire moves that they don't just keep driving their steak down but they keep following that Pillar of Fire because he'll not lead you off the word he leads you always back to the word some of you people need an app some of you are getting one now where did I stop where am I did we finish that uh did we finish that not quite come out let's serve god with one heart one mind one Accord is that right and then and then God even in the absence of the prophet even in the physical absence of Moses God will take his church over Jordan although we know that there was a portion of brother branham's Ministry that was also under a Joshua commission he said so he identified for us who the real Joshua is it's the Holy Ghost we've got to have the Holy Ghost we've got to have the Holy Ghost I didn't say we've got to speak in tongues I said we've got to have the Holy Ghost because he changes everything amen he tuned you up so that you can hear the voice of God and keep moving forward he said God will take his church over Jordan that's over death now you believe that with all your heart and and that that's a that's something that we have to settle within ourselves whether we can believe that with all of our heart is at the end of that one charity all right now let's go on Israel in the church paragraph 56 on up they come into the smitten Rock notice when they come to the Rock they had need now Moses smote the rock with the rod he said that's where we left last night smote the rock with the rod and the rod was God's judgment Rod it represented the judgments of God and he smote The Rock and guess what happened there was a cleft there was a breach there was a break in the left side of the Rock he said when the children of Israel got hungry this is interesting they went there a beehive got in there made a hive and they got honey out of the Rock right where The Rock was smitten everything they had need of read it I love to hear you was in The Rock The Rock followed the church and The Rock was when they were thirsty when they were hungry wherever they went the rock followed them who's ever heard of such a thing as that but I believe it Gene Edwards did an amazing job some of you have read the Divine Romance by Gene Edwards Gene Edwards did an amazing job in the Escape in the in the series of books that he wrote where he dramatized different Bible events one was the creation one was the Escape out of Egypt and one was the birth of Jesus I think and if you ever have a chance to get to to read any of that from I think it was called The Escape he made that so real until it it it it it it shook me I mean it really really shook me because he believed from from his uh understanding and here evidently brother Madam is telling us pretty much the same thing and the word said so in First Corinthians chapter 10 but he made it seem real he said here they they went on and they got thirsty again and somebody said what are we going to do this is Gene Edwards now somebody said what are they going to do and he turned around and guess what the rock of Horeb was there oh somebody said I can't believe anything like that you can't you can't believe that God is a supernatural God and he knows how to pick up a rock this wasn't an ordinary rock it was a rock that represented something when they were thirsty they drank from The Rock when they were hungry they ate from The Rock wherever they went the rock followed them and guess what and The Rock still following the church oh Hallelujah Christ is the rock that was in the wilderness notice now then what'd he say that same Rock in the same message paragraph 173 stay with me if you can but when he glorified himself down there instead of God his brother branham's interpretation of of how Moses behaved he drew the attention to himself he he lifted himself up in the sight of the people instead of glorifying God when he glorified himself down there instead of God before that rock when God told him said go speak to the Rock don't Smite it speak to it The Rock was only smitten it was only to be smitten one time and Moses got his temper all up and ran down run down there and smote The Rock it didn't bring water he said so he smote it again it brought water said you rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock he said like that and brought forth the waters because God had to listen to that Prophet because he had endowed him with that power isn't that something maybe it would have been tempting to make an example out of Moses but he had already put the power in Moses he had already given Moses the voice of authority and he was not going to humiliate him in front of the people even though Moses was glorifying himself and not the God who sent him and and then he goes on to say and that broke the whole program because how many times was Christ to be smitten once when he finished that that that death and and took his blood and placed it on The Mercy Seat he was never to have to die again he was never to be crucified again he was never to have to bleed again he'd already done that Christ was submitting once we speak we speak we speak to the Rock now we speak to the right now remember last Sunday it was ask and you shall receive seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you remember last Sunday it was it was ask abundantly seek passionately and be annoying with your knock that's what he said be an annoyance with your knock it's about verbalizing vocalizing your need and and it almost sounds like that it's a petition it's it's a I don't want to say a beg because this little bride doesn't have to beg but she's laying it out very over and over again she's laying out her need like the little woman knocking again telling it again telling it again telling it again there comes a time when God said you've cried enough you've begged enough you've whined enough you've asked enough and now it's time to do something else just speak to it just speak to it it's already been smitten just speak to it and look what it does read the rest and it what in the message the angel and his Commission the Angel and the commission he said now let's just get right down to our hearts now and I want to tell you something and we want to talk just for a few minutes just Heart to Heart he said now notice excuse me sorry but now I realize and you realize too and ministers that a man can take a Divine I don't want you to miss this church a man can take a Divine gift and send his soul to hell with it he said you know that it's a question a gift from God now I don't mean just something that you imagine he said I mean if God has really given something and give it to your charge you've got I hope you're hearing me you've got to use that with the wisdom of God because you might have a Divine gift but if you operate that gift separated from the wisdom of God you can jeopardize your own eternity did I say that right now this is a message that we need to focus because sometimes we we preach about gifts we believe in gifts we see where we feel like brother random said and we feel the same I can see where they were placed in the church I'm still looking for worthy where they come out I know we have Brethren around this message who believes that that which is perfect has come and so we don't need these little pieces of gifts any longer I don't believe that because in one place brother Branham calls that which is perfect he calls it the perfect interpretation or the fullness of the word and several times he said that's perfect love and although we may have the perfect interpretation of the word we're we're still pushing toward believing for we know we've been loved with perfect love and now we're trying to learn to love one another I was in a meeting one time when they were they were preaching this and and uh and they and they brought in this perfect love thing and that it was part of that which is perfect and if it wasn't here but they preached it as though they had received this perfect love and that it was just you know emanating and flowing out of their life and I went to them after the meeting and and appreciated so many wonderful things that I heard but then I asked I'm just wondering how is your perfect love how are are you in that place can you testify to me that that perfect love is present in your life and and it's just demonstrating itself and flowing out of you and I didn't mean to be confrontational I didn't mean to be controversial but what I got next was a tongue lashing like I'd never had and when I got through I wanted to be humble I wanted to be sweet and I wanted to take my weapon with kindness but and then I did but when I walked away I thought if that's perfect love you just castigated you you you you you you you totally if I was just following because of a popularity or something I would have I'd have run run the other direction but it's just like it's just like brother Wallace used to sing you didn't put me in and you can't put me out I'm gonna tell you that this bride is going to have to operate in perfect love we're going to have to have it and a good way to have it is to start practicing loving one another in spite of our flaws amen you ask the Lord sometime Lord let me love people like you love them let me not focus on their failure let me focus on their faith let me believe that you're not finished with them yet so I believe in gifts and sometimes we're preaching to try to uh get people and encourage people to to yield themselves to the gift that God has placed in their life we're just bringing a balance here by saying that any Divine gift when it's not used with wisdom Moses had a Divine gift but he wasn't operating that day with the wisdom and it changed his destiny he was a chosen man to take the children of Israel over but instead he found himself up on the top of Mount Nebo and he was told I'm going to show you you're gonna see it with your eyes but you're not going to be able to taste thereof because you used what I gave you and you glorified yourself in the opportunity that you had to glorify me so I'd say if we're going to use the gifts of God that have been placed in our lives we should only use them for the benefit of the Lord Jesus Christ and that they should operate in wisdom and they should never be used to beat people or to expose people to embarrass people I didn't mean to make you nervous now he goes on make this Valley full of ditches I want to go there if you let me no no excuse me the works that I do bear that that I do bear witness of me and just a couple more and we'll move on he said now notice now Moses smote the rock the second time representing that Christ should come to the Earth and die again now he had power to bring forth the water out of the rock whether it was it's awesome now this helps us to see the power and authority that was placed in Moses as God's prophet he had the authority to cause that water to flow whether it was God's perfect will or not he said did you know that he said everybody will admit that it wasn't God's will but Moses done it anyhow he had power God entrusted him to be a prophet and he gave him those powers to do that and he found out that his servant failed him and he glorified himself in the stead of God and then what happened God hello God dealt with Moses then didn't he he said not with the children those chiding children those bellyaching children those murmuring grumbling children he didn't deal with them who did he deal with he dealt with Moses the holy spirit is given to a man and gifts are given to a man how about you all read that for me [Music] but you have to watch what you're doing with those divine gifts the next one I'm almost done with these he said look you're here this is making the valley full of ditches the organized church was Moses the lawgiver and the law Giver Moses glorified himself in the stead of God and look what the penalty was wasn't permitted to take the children over Jordan now listen and how he types that for the day he said and the church today is doing what glorifying themselves I belong to the assemblies I belong to the Church of God I belong to this or that we could say I Belong To The Message Church don't let me offend you by telling the truth if you think that is is your your you know your trophy there's no trophy I belong to this or that or the other what are you anyhow that's right it's the truth now there's good men and every one of them we're Brethren break down that thing he's talking about the walls of division but he said look a man that had been with them all along Joshua a type of the signs and wonders he was the one who was permitted not the church group not the organization but Joshua was pulled out and took the children of Israel across Jordan that's right remember he tells us that our Joshua is the Holy Ghost now I want to move to speak to the Rock paragraph 41. if you'll just perk up just long enough to hear this he said let's look at some people that spoke to the Rock you see we're transitioning from bitter belly syndrome to speaking to prophesying again we're transitioning from striking The Rock to speaking to the Rock and so he comes and takes the sermon speak to the Rock and it shall give forth his water he said let's look at some people that spoke to the Rock let's find out what taken place the first man ever spoke to a rock was a man that got tied up in some theology he made himself a set of fig leaves Adam he thought that'll do just as good as anything but when it come face to face with God he found out he was naked what did he do he spoke to the Rock and the rock made away Hallelujah you don't hear Brother random talking so many times about Adam like this this is a powerful position a powerful powerful place here he said what did he do he spoke to the Rock and the rock made a way of Escape for him the rock that was in Eden he said there was Noah another man who had preached and the people ignored and laughed at him one day he spoke to the Rock and The Rock took him in the ark and tucked him away in his arms and rode him above the storm and drowned the persecuting world yes sir Noah there was a man named Daniel once who was in the Lion's Den he went out into Babylon he said in himself that he was not going to defile himself with the king's me he wasn't going to have anything to do with the world though he had to live among them people but he wasn't going to defile himself he purposed in his heart he wasn't and one day the king throwed him into the lion's pit because he was walking in the line of duty but what did he do he spoke to the Rock and that Pillar of Fire came down and kept the Lions off of him all night long see it's not just a children's story it worked for Noah it worked for Daniel if you make the transition it'll work for you if you'll let your faith go from Moses to The Rock if you'll let your faith go from the from from William Branham the prophet to the god of William Branham [Applause] that's not critical I'm not being critical I'm telling you it's a necessary transition and if the bride can't make that transition she'll stay in this old Satan's Eden until she gets the authority to make the transition if we can't let him decrease so that Christ the word in us can increase we will miss it this is not to correct him this is not to to take away one minute from the office no sir they were someone was talking to me about some of the different things that they've got for people to see in Jeffersonville some of the artifacts and and you know I'm just built differently than some people are I enjoy I enjoy that I'm a little bit of a history buff when I saw the cup that brother Branham served communion out of it blessed me I didn't bow down I didn't kiss it through the glass but I thought to myself just like I did in in Williamsburg Virginia just like I do in Washington DC just like I've done in many places around the world or if that cup could talk I'm not offended I'm not I'm not offended I I I'm not offended I have some things in my office uh that belong to brother random I'm not offended I I appreciate them I'm just that kind of a person I'm just sentimental enough that I love those saying I'm so blessed when I get to be in a place where brother Brandon preached and the sick were healed and Devils were cast out I love being in a place like that it blesses me so I'm not in any way trying to take away from the man or the ministry I'm just telling you it's a necessary transition that the bride is going to have to make that our focus goes back to the Rock and I tell you he told us where to put our Focus and we better listen to what he had to say don't they always like to tell me say what he said I found out if you sometimes say what he said they don't like that either cause you said it just recently I heard some new criticisms most of the time we try not to even lose a Beat you just keep marching because they will come but recently I heard they were telling in Canada of all places the place where the Lord sent me to find a wife that's a holy place they were telling you know down at Shelley's Church you don't ever hear him saying Reagan's Church or Pruitt's Church I have found a special category down at Shelley's church he said they teach people it told us at the Youth Camp last week or so they teach people to dance in the spirit I wish I was a better teacher I wished I could I I wish that I could teach you the importance of worshiping the Lord in spirit and in truth but I wouldn't ever want to try to teach anybody and I wouldn't permit anybody else around here to teach somebody how to dance in the spirit but I'm not ashamed I want you to know I'm not ashamed to dance before the Lord the psalmist set up Praise Him in the dance praise him on the loud sounding symbols let everything that had breath praise the Lord [Music] [Applause] if I'm guilty of teaching anything about worship I'm guilty of this I have set an example before this body that even preachers even pastors should Worship the Lord I'm not going to ask you to worship him if I don't come out here and worship him if I can't raise my hands I'm not going to ask you to raise your hands we need it I'm telling you we need we need to get in that presence we need to make this transition we can preach all day on the Rock being smitten and there's no greater message to preach that Christ was smitten for us but then the question falls on us what are we going to do about it let's make it personal let's speak to the Rock the pillar of fire came down and kept the Lions off of him all night long because he spoke because he spoke to the Rock before he went to the pit I think oh go back that was too good got to read it again some of you songwriters ought to ought to write a song and put that in it as a line it's good because he spoke to the Rock before he went into the pit we better speak to the Rock because we don't know yet what we're going to face in this world just yet are you still here it's 1 20. why are you acting like it's 4 20. it's just 120. and just remember you won't have to be back tonight this is it in fact I think about now we're moving into Sunday night so can I start over now you can go on charity there was the Hebrew children who wouldn't bow down to the images of King Nebuchadnezzar brother random didn't always say that it was Nebuchadnezzar that's not always what he said when he's talking about yeah he said down to the images there but many places where he's talking about this image that the children of Israel were commanded to kneel down and bow he said it was in fact of Daniel the Prophet am I right and so if you didn't bow down to the prophet if you didn't make him your object of worship and you spend the night in the in the furnace but like some of the Bride have learned it's two as a company three is a crowd there is a place you have to find in Christ where it's not you and your pastor and Jesus it's not you and the prophet's Ministry and Jesus it's you and Jesus now I'll be honest with you for me without that prophet's message I don't believe I could have even found my place in the tent with him but because he revealed him to me you see the god of my childhood the Jesus I'm going to be very transparent here the Jesus of my childhood was an Untouchable Jesus I love the Lord with all I had to love him with but the but the God that was presented to me was one who was just as ready to squish me as he wants to help me everything we lived in great fear because everything was sin how how desperately we needed a messenger to come and tell us that there's only one sin after all that's unbelief so it wasn't in Our Sleeve after all it wasn't in our caffeine intake after all it wasn't whether or not a woman had a hat on or not after all it was really more than that so the god of my childhood the Jesus of my childhood was sort of an Untouchable Jesus I I I had a lot of fear that wasn't reverential fear It Was Fear of what might happen when I called granny and she didn't answer the phone I just knew the Rapture had taken place and I had missed the whole thing but once the messenger once that message came and introduced me to who Jesus really is The God Who had been Untouchable became more than just my God I realized as we sung this morning he calls me he not only cost me son or servant but like Abraham and David of all he calls me friend and he longs to have fellowship with me so I may not have even known that I was to go into that tent with Jesus alone had it not been for the message but the reality is I can't take my pastor in there I can't take my prophet in there you can't even take your wife or your husband in there when you enter into that place of relationship with him of an intimate and and personal nature it's you and Jesus [Music] and I was reading yesterday where brother Reno said in that Veil you get in there that Veil falls behind you and you're not thinking about the world anymore you're thinking about what you've just stepped into hallelujah hallelujah throw them into the fiery furnace and they what did they do they spoke to the Rock and the fourth man was standing in the fiery furnace there you wonder who the rocket the Rock of Ages Hallelujah David said little more this is a long one he said notice Hagar she's been put out of her home she had a little nursing boy Ishmael she went out into the desert no place to go the water run out what could she do she'd been raised in a home that was acquainted with The Rock and what did she do she didn't want to see the baby die so she took the little fellow laid him under a tree went off a bow shot and fell down on her knees and spoke to the Rock you think if God heard if God heard Hagar don't you think God will hear his broad Sarah [Applause] and The Rock poured forth his Waters and that baby was saved and to this day Bathsheba still stands out of the fountain God who has seen me she spoke to the rock for her dying baby can you speak to the Rock tonight and listen to this are you on speaking terms with him [Music] do you know anything about him Joshua he just won't come over Jordan and made that great decision he still the people said we're able to take it God said Joshua you're the one who knows all about it I'll just let you leave the children from now on he got over to his first campaign he got up against Jericho wall he walked around it and said now how am I going to get over it how am I going to send them walls they got all those rocks and things laying up there they're bows and things ready to shoot and here we are out here mostly unarmed just what we picked up from the spoil across our journey and there we are how am I going to do it after a while he saw a man standing with his sword drawn or you uh who are you are you with our enemy well he's perhaps running a story or two together here he said now I am the captain of the host of the Lord Joshua did what spoke to the rock and a shout went out and the walls fell down because he spoke to the Rock hello is there more several hundred years later from then there was an old blind beggar sitting on some old stones that had fell from that wall oh my the speaking of the rock had done been explained out of the church there was no such a thing but he was sitting there blind thinking about it on the road when he knowed that Elisha and Elijah come down that same road arm and arm going to the Jordan just before there Joshua had spoke to this Great Captain and the host of the Lord he said oh if I would have lived in that day I would have spoke to him too and about that time of noise began to come you know usually where God's at oh I just love it I love it when they tell me Jesus didn't preach loud Jesus didn't jump and shouting and and holler and and and and pray wave his arms and I said oh no no no he didn't have to but everybody he touched it I don't know why it is but there's a lot of noise wherever God come here come that same captain of the host of the Lord just a few more minutes people tried to get him to shut up but he spoke to the Rock and guess what the Rock gave him his sight they tried to make him shut up they tried to hold his peace setting their shiver and his little bare legs laying there in the sun this little withered arms and the old ragged coat but he'd throw that coat one side to the other and took off but why he was ready to speak to the Rock and The Rock gave him back his side Hallelujah he said that's a warning to every blind man entered tonight whether you're spiritually blind or physical blind speak to the Rock he's a sight giving Rock speak to the Rock there was a woman one time went out of the well to get some water she was in bad shape I know I'm reading fast she didn't follow this you can find it she was a prostitute she'd seen a man sitting over there against the wall she didn't know who he was after a while he said woman give me a drink he went to talking to her until he found out what her trouble was he said go get your husband she said I have none why said that's true you've had five in the one you're living with now is not your husband he went to talking excuse me she said sir I perceive that thou art a prophet we know that there's a rock coming someday call the Messiah and he will do this he said I'm he I'm he that speaks to you I can see her drop that water Potter big pretty eyes shine into the city she went knowing that she had spoke to the rock hallelujah and she'd found water that didn't come out of that well to draw oh Hallelujah she'd spoke to the Rock that little Martha the Little Martha um this is the last paragraph of that one time her brother was dead and was buried four days out in the grave rotten already skin worms eating in his body and she heard there was something in that City that Jesus had come she went out there where he was at and she fell down before me she said Lord if you would have been here my brother would have not died but even now Lord whatever you ask God God will give it to you he said thy brother shall rise again why she spoke hello Church she spoke to the Rock Amen and it brought forth death out of corruption and rebuked death and brought life where a man had been dead four days stood on his feet and lived again because what the disciples one night out on the sea all hopes were gone and what happened they they seen something look like a spirit coming to them they found out it was The Rock and they spoke to the Rock new hopes come in I'm waiting on you to catch it and the way they went and the whole thing was spared why because they spoke to the Musicians are coming musicians Hallelujah [Music] you got it did you get it thank you Jesus I've done a lot of reading I know oh is it really all right good I'm going to finish with it one more I want you to make a Daniel spoke Adam spoke Martha spoke Bond Bartimaeus smoke yes the disciples spoke on the boat Hagar spoke to the Rock you think it was just for them no there is a transitioning from understanding that The Rock had to be smitten on our behalf and because it has been we're given Authority to come back and get the honey out of the out of the cleft of the rock Rock of Ages cleft for me let me hide myself in thee when Moses saw the Lord and the glory of the Lord he stood in that Cliff Place and he not only saw the Lord but he said he he saw as the Lord passed by he saw his hinder parts isn't that what he said you and I think of the physical anatomy and no doubt there was something there he saw some Shadow some image that caused him to say such a thing as that but we understand that Moses was the one who wrote the first five books of the Bible he wrote them with the Scribe the first five books of the Bible how in the world could Moses have wrote about the creation if he had not been there how could he have wrote about the Book of Genesis had he not been there but you see that day on that mountain standing there in the cleft of that rock God passed by you saw not only where God was in that moment but he saw where God had been and it was because of that inspiration that he was able to write in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth because he saw where God had been let me tell you something you love that about Moses I love that about Moses but let me tell you something about that every person in this building if you choose to you can see where God has been you can see where God is today and what he's doing today and you can see where God's going and all you have to do is look to the message of the hour that God has given us in this day it's there you get this little attitude maybe some that aren't familiar with these things maybe you pass through you get some latitude I don't know why they're putting so much emphasis on on that because that Bible became a living book when God began to open up those Mysteries you know just like somebody else out there might have a favorite preacher because that preacher taught them more than other people had taught them that's lovely I love that I'm not against that everybody can have somebody that they can can relate to but this is bigger than that this was God uncovering those Mysteries that have been hidden every time every time a writer would try to write and the voice would say seal it up Daniel tried to write it seal it up it's not time yet John tried to write it don't write it seal it up don't tell it it's not time yet how many of you can be thankful I am so thankful to God I live in an hour where it's no longer sealed up Now give me spoken word is Original Seed this is the first message I ever heard about 1988. changed my life and it still changing my life paragraph 358 notice don't read ahead of me this time stay with me you cheaters notice what Harmony now this this is one of those quotes that's used in the church age book it's it's actually one you can find you can't find them all they're not all there but here's one you can find he said notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until he's seen of the father or the father showed him first Harmony between God and Christ see John 5 19. so will hello so will abroad what a Harmony between Father and Son so will the bride and he shows her his Word of Life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it listen how powerful to believe it to receive it without doubt look at how powerful nothing can harm her not even death death can't touch you somebody said well we we have loved ones who die they can't leave one half a second before they're called it's not the power of death that takes them from us [Music] that was dealt with it calvary it's God you know the scripture we've talked about so many times precious in the sight of the Lord isn't going home of the Saints weighty that word precious there is weighty it's a well-contemplated moment when God takes a saint out of here and it's not the power of death taking them out it's God calling them in that moment so it's not a car accident it's not coveted it's not the wrong doctor how many times do we hear people say if they could have only got to the right hospital if they could have only got the right medicine if they could have only afforded the right treatment hello is that what you believe or if you come to believe in the sovereignty of God let me tell you something God can get to you what you need to keep you here if his will is for you to stay here if I were you I wouldn't plan on leaving a half a day early I just say Lord let me be here till the very last moment and when you open up that door just let me pass right on through to Eternity he shows her and she receives it and she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will rise it up again amen he said then I got a great big Hallelujah he said here is the secret brother Greeley what's the next phrase the word is in the bride and and the mind of Christ to know you ought to write that down go back you're worse than I am about telling a joke I always get the punch line wrong and you're giving my punch like she's going you're giving my punch line away before I get there they all laughed at me all week long because of the way I had these brothers to read they they said you shouldn't have none of them to read you interrupted them all the way through I said I can do that here is the secret I want you to take this home here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah okay charity punchline and she does it she the bride and she does it in his name she's not crying about it anymore wallowing around and wrestling about it anymore no no no no she's not begging she realizes I I'm not an orphan anymore I've been adopted [Music] she does it in his name this is so powerful I know I was a little critical a minute ago so let me let me be a little critical again if this were only in the church age book I'll be honest with you if it were only in the church age book I wouldn't believe it this is a this is a quote that is in the church age book that we can go right back and point you to the fact that Lee Vale isn't saying anything extra here in fact you'll find that brother Brandon was very eloquent here he didn't need a lot of help on this one at all did he I'm not taking away I'm being honest and she does it in his name this is the kicker this is the kicker this this got me thrown out of Sacramento California almost 30 years ago because I was preaching then that that the voice of the Resurrection would be in the bride just like he said it if the voice of the Resurrection is in the bride then the bride calls for the resurrection it's not her voice it's the bridegroom's voice because she's one with him and she's the word and they they oh they all the way to the airport they got me told abroad I said I didn't do it he did I didn't make it up let me show you where he said it she has go back charity here is the secret got a song Ready you sure here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of Christ to know how to handle to know what he wants done with the word go on and she does it in his name this isn't building her own little kingdom or making some little Ministry for herself she don't have time to worry about that oh no she's worried and concerned about the kingdom of God she's become one with it with the Lord one with Jesus one with his word like he was one with the father she does it in his name she has she has she has I don't mean to be critical but I was in a meeting big meeting one time when this quote was being read and they did this kind of thing here he took the books spoken word book and tucked in an arm and they said now this is how this is how she has the saith the Lord because she's heard the thus saith the Lord message so when he says she has thus saith the Lord what he means is she has the message that's true she has the message but that's not what he's teaching all you have to do is go back and read the paragraph before it we don't have the saith the Lord because we got the book where it does save the Lord or we hear the tape where thus say the Lord's mentioned no no God's giving that thus saith the Lord Authority it's part of the restoration of the spoken word you see if you think it's how if you think it's just about a little fish [Music] if you think it's just about a little old elderly sister and two backslid teenage what do they call what do you call them Nick or friends if you think it's about 2 2 somewhere or or just a uh before the hand touch it doctor's hand oh these are the examples that God gave the prophet and he brought them to us as examples but that same spoken word Authority is in this little bride we're being tested and tried and judged now until our character can be his until his attributes can shine in our life and then he loses her with thus saith the Lord and we're going to need it by the time we get out of here we're going to need help we're going to need help standing against our own government we're going to need help standing against our own come on then it is germanized so the Holy Spirit Waters it until it is grown and serves its purpose they do only his isn't that your cry this has not been my week I I can't say that I know for sure as I'm standing here today that this week I've only done his will I pray I am but when I come to that hour that I know when you come to that place where you're not just letting Lord let me do your will but you know that's all you can do because you have so surrendered you've so let him knock the rough edges out of your life you're so surrendered that you've become one with that word and so so to to think of something on your own it's just beyond you to do something in his name on your own is beyond you you would only do what he would have you to do that's how that's that is a quick short work that is a glorious few days however long of a real manifested sons of God on the Earth now you can put everything in the past if you want to but I don't know how I I hear how creative they get in trying to explain that all this has happened and the bride's Revival is all going either past or going on Among Us Now potentially I I can say Amen but what I'm looking for is a body of Believers around this world who can only do his will God help me no one can persuade them different they have thus saith the Lord don't you long for the perfect will of God in everything you do somebody said I don't think God cares where we go on vacation I disagree I disagree I think the Lord plants us somewhere sometimes I think he puts us in the right place at the right time and I think that's why people come up to us and while we minister to people wherever we are I think that's why walking off the beach in February of last year or the first part of March of last year I walked off the beach there uh uh and a elderly couple sitting there on the on the sand in a little lawn chairs reading a Bible study and and I'm down there to get away from people not to talk to people but they look so pleasant that I greeted them and they greeted me and 30 minutes later I'm still standing there talking to them she's talking to me about the end time instead of they're doing a Bible study that they've printed off the internet together and I ask them how are you baptized and they said in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost I said would you consider another way she said well we thought we did it the way Jesus said I said no doubt you would that's the understanding that you have but what if I show you that that verse says in the name of what if I could show you what the name is and she said well I sure would love to see that and then I said to them where are you all from oh we live in Jeffersonville Indiana I said oh you live in Jeffersonville Indiana my mama do you know the Miracles that took place in your city I gave them the address and I said have you ever gone by that little brick Tabernacle sitting there yes yes we've seen that and yes we've heard of yes we've heard the name Branham but we hear some strange things I said oh yes and if you go to Google when you get back to your hotel you'll find even stranger things but let me tell you something I am personally acquainted I have personally met in my lifetime several hundred people that were in the meetings that saw these miracles for themselves and heard things they'd never heard before and she said mom writing all this down you see I had to be there at that right time I'm not trying to make everything spiritual but isn't it when it touches the bride we gotta go yes I think God cares I think we want to be in his perfect will not his permissive will I want to be in the mountains when I'm supposed to be there I want to be in Iceland when I'm supposed to be and I said let's stay in she will only do his will and persuade them different they have there's going to be a lot of keeping still because if we don't know what he would have us to do right now we just do nothing we just hold coming an hour as we transition from crying out pleading for our need and just going to the Rock and speaking how many of you just like to start practicing nothing wrong with that let your faith according to

hear the Lord saying I'm jealous for your attention I long for your focus to be fixed on me I'm jealous to be the passion of your life I could just hear the spirit of the Lord calling out like that and that's because he loves you that's because he loves you and he just wants to be not just a random thought but he wants to be the reason why you live he wants you to make him the reason why you get up in the morning and the last thought that you have as you get ready to go to bed at night he he really desires to walk with you he wants to be more than just somebody you call on when you need something he wants to have relationship with you Lord I pray right now that you would give him the grace to just open up his heart in such a way that you could capture his affection Lord Jesus capture his passion and capture his affection may this old world and all that it has to offer not have an attraction in his heart May every hook that Satan has placed in his inner being may it be removed as graciously as possible may he surrender every bit of it to the Lord today and walk out of here ladder walk out of her lighter with the heaviness off of him so that he can just fully surrender to you I want you to begin to tell the Lord you love him that's it that's right that's what we must do just let him know I love you Lord I want to serve you I don't just want your blessing I don't want I just don't want your blessing I want you Lord I want you I want to be all that you have created me to be all that you have called me to be Lord may he surrender to you today in every part of his life as you reach for him Lord the prophet told us we couldn't see God not at any time unless God was seeking us now Lord you have confirmed today that you are seeking Levi that you're seeking him and that you want his heart and that you want to be his passion and so Lord it ought to just be then that he can open up right now yes that's him all over you that's the spirit of the Lord this won't to claim you as his own some of you young Brothers come in close let me rest a minute you'll come in around him some of you that have known the touch of the Lord and you pray for him right now I want him to lock into this before he goes out of here today Lord he's interested to know your will he came up here because he doesn't want to do it on his own he wants to find your will for his life and Lord I know that part of that will is a heart surrendered give him the Grace today give him the Grace today Lord may he never be ashamed of those tears may he never be ashamed of may they just come right out of the fullness of his inner man oh Jesus oh thank you Father would you just put a little more faith this way just one more time Lord let our brother come to a place of Peace in you appear a place of Blessed assurance where he could know that you are guiding still where he could know that you wanted you want him to be fully surrendered [Music] whoa [Music] Jesus [Music] you are the one that we

one another just a minute heart's always hunger for oh our hearts always hunger you are the one [Music] we adore [Music] oh our hearts always hunger one more time before we pray [Music] [Applause] [Music] always want [Music] one now we want to just pray over the hawkson family uh he told you when he spoke the last time the miracle that God had performed both last year and this year and and I don't think it's necessary to say but the finances that God has provided they didn't come from this church body to me that makes it even more Supernatural because if if you all got behind the mission and gave that's wonderful but if someone else would feel it in their heart someone not a part of this body would feel it in their heart to sponsor them home back to Hawk's home and this was something God dealt with him about years ago that they would make these trips in the summer and the bank account said it's not possible but just at the right time the Lord said it was possible so they have family to minister to and he does he does work at the television network most of you know that's where Hulk came from he was saved among those Brethren there heard the message of Truth there and God so graciously gave him to us and to Maribeth and these three beautiful children and I just want the Lord to use him in whatever way he has friends all over the island what's the population now it used to be years ago 300 000 but it's more than that now huh 360 000 in the whole island nation and they have over 400 000 tourists every year can you imagine having more tourists than you have citizens but Hawk knows people all over that Island you heard his testimony on the podcast he's got a he's got drug buddy tattoo buddies running up the road Buddies and you know you'd be surprised how many of them have come to the Lord some of them have come to the Lord through the years and uh most of you know some of the brothers there you've met him you've met brother Ziggy and you've met brother Magnuson and and you met brother uh Erickson and Sister Christine and you know you know that this is a worthy field and they get to enjoy the beauty also but there's Ministry in this so I want us to pray over them today and send them in the name of the Lord to enjoy themselves yes but to be a light and to be salt and to share this truth wherever they go would you just join with me right now let's ask the Lord father we just anoint each one of them with oil thank you for what you're doing for Joseph thank you for what we saw you do last Sunday Lord may he carry that deposit of your glory in his life and may you just add to it again and again and again Lord we anoint Our Sister Mary Beth in the name of Jesus what a blessing she has been to our lives all these years since she was just a little girl she has served you and loved you and allowed you to minister through her life wrap her up in this hour use her For Your Glory oh God in the name of Jesus oh Lord if there's any part of her inner being that's damned or stopped I pray that you would open up the flood I pray that nothing would be held back in her oh Jesus I know the gift of intercession that she carries I know the gift of music that she carries I don't know everything you've called her for but Lord let every bit of it be just as free-flowing as that rock was speak to the rock with her now and I ask you Lord to open up the way [Music] in the name of Jesus Lord you see the toll of life you see it Lord Jesus restore breathe on her breathe free on her Lord as only you can Stacy come here honey and lay your hand in her belly [Music] open up you said Lord that out of our bellies rivers of living water should flow I speak to the river in her belly come more spring up a well of God's holy spirit in the name of Jesus heal and restore and sue the god let the kiss of Heaven be upon every part of her life today Lord for sister Rebecca radiant may she be radiant Lord in Iceland may your sweet Spirit be upon her o God shine Lord out of her life For Your Glory that's right honey just raise up your hand don't ever get used to that don't ever let that become common oh that is Spirit would touch us [Music] in the name of Jesus Hallelujah [Music] let your sweet tender hand be on earth Lord I pray for Esther Estee my bestie Lord I ask you to cover her with your wonderful presence protect her little body keep her healthy oh God and hold let her be a blessing she's an attraction all to herself may she just attract the right attention May Hearts turn toward her Lord Mom and Daddy as they minister in Fellowship in the name of Jesus Lord I pray over Hulk today that you would increase his ministry in the name of Jesus that a heavier anointing than ever before would be cloaked about his shoulders and that he would find a new Authority in his mouth and a new boldness in his mouth in the name of Jesus I pray that answers will come to every question that he has before you and that you will show him again and again and again let every purpose of this trip be revealed and may they step into every glorious part of it for the sake of the Kingdom ah Lord I ask you to turn over in his inner man the bells those Joy Bells those Glory bells that wonderful ushering forth of the holy spirit let it be upon him in such a way that it would shine in the airports and shine wherever they go Lord his precious family you know that I love them each one of them I'm asking you Lord to make the difference in their life could this be the time that they would surrender every part of who they are to you give you glory as you cover them every mile of the journey yes in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah Hallelujah why don't you love them why don't you greet them and we send them I'm so thankful we're sending them for a short time but we're sending them if God lays on your heart and you want to uh pass a blessing along to them the trip was paid for but the expenses of three children and traveling in a place like that and you might hand it to them and if you want to give it through the church on Tuesday night you can and we can we can actually transfer it by cash out to them anything you feel led to do would you just hold still just a moment Lord thank you for today no service is the same but I'm so thankful that you have come to have your way today would you breathe over the the people and renew their strength and I know these long Services can take a toll on their body and mind we'll just renew them today I pray and may we all just go forth in your strength and in your healing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray those traveling Lord let Angels line the highways and keep them safe the rest of the way we'll give you praise and honor and glory amen would you please continue to remember Sister Janet Miller it breaks my heart for her to say that I'm in such extreme pain brother Shelley I know that the Lord can touch that I want the Lord to do it and I believe he can so let's go and remember her in prayer Tuesday night seven o'clock next Sunday at 11. go out loving the Lord and loving one another would you do that this morning God bless you it's all right thank you [Music]
