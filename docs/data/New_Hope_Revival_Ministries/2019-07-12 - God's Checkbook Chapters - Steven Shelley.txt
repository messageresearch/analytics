TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] I'm wondering if you've ever done work for someone maybe a job an odd job around their house or property maybe it was painting or even mowing the lawn and the owner of that property hand you a check before you ever started and said I'm gonna sign my name and whenever you're finished you just make out the check for whatever you want and it'll be good I don't think that happens very often but I want you to know that as a believer our Father has given us that blank not only blank check but a blank checkbook the Lord Jesus his name is signed on the bottom of every one of those checks and we are encouraged to ask him for our needs I love John chapter 15 in that chapter in my Bible it's full of red letters and that means it's full of the words of Jesus in John 15:1 jesus said I am the vine and you are the branches he goes on to explain that the branches must remain connected to the vine the branches do not have life of their own but they're grafted into the vine or attached to the vine and their life is really his life and if they remain that way they'll bear fruit and we want to be fruitful for sure in John chapter 15 and verse 7 Jesus said particularly if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you will ask what you will and it shall be done unto you now that's a promise that you can really take to the bank because everything you and I have need of on this journey in life it has already been deposited into our Grace account if we need salvation salvation is in our account divine healing is in our account already paid for by the death of our Lord Jesus Christ by the stripes that he bore on his precious back sometimes you and I as believers we may be afraid to write out the check to make a withdrawal on that account there's one way that we can make sure that fear doesn't keep us from making a withdrawal on what has already been provided for us and that is heed the words of our Lord in verse 7 if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask in the amplified bible it says if you live in me abide vitally united to me and my words remain in you and continue to live in your hearts ask whatever you will and it shall be done for you it says something very similar in the complete Jewish Bible in fact in all of the different translations that I looked in it all says something very similar the truth is that if you and I will hear the word of the Lord if we will surrender our lives to that word and seek to obey the Lord then we have the checkbook in our hands maybe we could look at it this way say for instance daddy says to Johnny his son you go outside and play now and stay out of the street now Johnny you know that the cars come by very fast on our street and if you're playing out in that Street and someone comes along that doesn't see you in time it could take your life and if you'll play in the yard as I've asked you to do when you come in in the afternoon I'll have a popsicle for you Oh Johnny's excited about that it he goes outside and plays in the front yard and for a little while the neighbors come over and play with him and he's very occupied when they have to go home he gets rather bored and he says I really would like to kick a can around in the street the next thing you know Johnny is out in the middle of the street and literally cars are having to dodge Johnny and his kin in a little while even that doesn't occupy him and he comes inside and he says alright dad I'm ready for my popsicle and his dad said but Johnny I can't give you a popsicle I asked you to stay in the yard for your own safety for your own protection and instead you were right out in the middle of the street again it could have been bad Johnny if I give you the popsicle how will you ever learn the importance of doing what daddy asks you to do you know that makes a world of sense to me I was once that boy for one thing it also makes sense because that's really what Jesus is saying in John 15 and verse 7 if you'll keep my word in your heart not just as something beautiful like poetry or something do to memorize but if you will keep it in your heart so that it can guide you and instruct you literally it's for our own safety it's for our own protection that God has given us this precious word he said and if you'll do that and remain in fellowship with me unity with me union with me then you can ask whatever you will and it'll be given to you I tell you that's powerful it's so very powerful it's like having the checkbook the Lord Jesus his signature at the bottom a very special servant of the Lord a man who was a prophet of God brother William Branham was preaching many years ago about God's checkbook and he said everything you need is made available for you just like we said a moment ago but he said all you have to do is put your name right down there co-sign your name with Jesus Christ and then cash that check if it gets to the clearing house and everything is in order then whatever the check has been made for will be yours that is so powerful to me we are co-signing what what part do we have well we have our faith we have to put our faith in there we have to believe that if we ask we know how we've lived we know we have surrendered to the Lord we've repented of our sin we know what the promise is and if we can truly believe only belief then we write our names right beside the Lord the clearing house is just someone checking to make sure that all the funds are in order and the Holy Ghost the Spirit of God I think he acts as that clearing house we know when we're not doing what the Lord has asked us to do we know it s believers we feel that little prick in our heart I just want to encourage you today to do everything you can to stay in Jesus in fellowship and in communion with him what a promise what a gift he's given us if you abide in me and my words abide in you you will have the checkbook and you can write it out for whatever you have need of I believe him with all my heart god bless you
