Title:    Above All Else, Guard Your Heart — Part 14 | Pastor Steven L. Shelley
Speaker:  Steven Shelley
Church:   New Hope Revival Ministries

========================================

Description:
This sermon explores the "spirit of offense" as a spiritual trap that partners with other negative influences like anger, bitterness, and division. Pastor Steven L. Shelley identifies three categories of partnering spirits: self-centeredness, bitterness, and divisiveness. The solution comes through receiving the "engrafted word" with meekness, which transforms the believer's soul (mind, will, and emotions). Using the metaphor of medical organ transplantation, the message emphasizes that complete surrender to God enables spiritual growth through temperance (self-control) and brotherly kindness, ultimately leading to an "unoffendable life."

sharing it's through that blood that redeeming love can be our [Music] theme all almost all the requests were for healing of these Earthly bodies Jesus and it's through the blood of Jesus Christ that we have healing right now you are glorified when your children are healed by your blood everything that we hope for and cling to was purchased by your blood by you laying down your life for us yes and

welcome you into the house of the [Applause] lord it's good to have the mans back today they yeah might I think so how long have you all been married now five months that is very newly yeah nice to meet the brother there wonderful God bless all of you we're so glad that you're here today brother man had to be called out to work last weekend when the store storm hit but we're glad that they're here today we're glad to see all of you just uh honored to be in the house of the Lord the Lord is faithful to us in every way we're going to receive the tithe and offering today for the purposes of the Kingdom brother Kate is already at the piano he's going to sing you know I I was reading something that I had written um some months ago I was reading it today just before coming to service a lot of times we don't say anything when it's time for the tithe and the offering we don't say a lot about it um and it becomes a ritual to us and tithing should never be a ritual to us because it is keeping Covenant with the lord it's it's what he has asked of us and so we keep that uh that Covenant with him and and our offering that we give to him you know we talk about projects that we're doing sometimes and and you're giving and of course it helps to keep the lights on and all of that kind of stuff but you know anytime that we give to the Lord we want to give with purpose we want to give because what we're actually doing is we're putting our faith to the prophetic Vision what God is doing on this property what he's doing with this body now what he does in other bodies that's what God gave to them but what he does here when you give give you are actually putting your faith your might your dollars behind the prophetic vision and you are putting your blessing on it saying I agree with this I agree with what God is doing and so as you give your tithe and offering today keep that in mind I am giving this as unto the Lord always it's unto the Lord but I am giving it in faith believing in the prophetic vision of this house and what the Lord is doing on our behalf so brother Ellas can I call on you brother Austin Yantis I'll call on you Jesse I forgot to welcome you I'm so glad that you're here glad I look that [Applause] way Jesse's been away on duty with the military but we're glad that he is back home for at least a little while brother Cade God bless you as you sing let's worship together today you love the Lord this morning I got to think about the lyrics about this just a minute ago and you can have any anything in this world but there's nothing better than him so just sing this with me this [Music] morning Seasons coming and Seasons go but through it all Lord still I know you're the same oh you're the [Music] same let people see what people say God I know what's true today and I know oh and I know I could search the world to see if I could ever find anything to match the love that Jesus has for me but there's nothing oh there's nothing better than you Lord better than you Lord and I will raise you till my cup's filled there's nothing better than you Lord better than you Lord on the mountain high in the valley Lord yourself my God because I know you rign oh you rain the grave wasn't quiet so neither am I oh I got to praise you you're might night and you're living in me well I could search the world to see that you alone are all I need no one else

nothing it's better than knowing you and serving you in the Lord good you may be seated again this morning would you let's uh give these musicians and you know the the the presence of the Lord is here but we're missing a lot of folks at 40 people and uh we have to come and press in and you've done well this morning and part of that is because these musicians create such a lovely atmosphere for us to come and worship the Lord in spirit and in truth I have no apologies that Hawke is H praying a few syllables in another language I'm not going to apologize to you or any other preacher or because they get on my last nerves when they're preaching and they say oh I feel like speaking in tongue oh I feel like well he felt it and there's liberty in this house and he did it if it confused anybody if there are any unbelievers or non-believers here and that confused you I'll be glad to see you after church and explain to you what it's about I don't think we have uh offended the Apostle Paul you know he's the character that said I speak in tongues more than you all so I think we're okay um and if not you streaming and you can just turn it off and find something else more edifying but I like Liberty where the spirit of the Lord is we're not going to let folks go on forever like that without some interpretation but I'm so thankful for the authority that we can catch in prayer would you thank the Lord for these [Applause] musicians I I just realized when I saw brother Shane sitting on the front that we didn't mention sister Jada and her family their family uh out of town taking care of her dad and being with her dad who is very sick with lugar's disease most of you know that that is one disease I've mentioned many times through the years as being one of the most awful debilitating humiliating diseases that people can suffer and uh I am did the musicians really go down I guess that really normally is the key isn't it I have a song I guess when I say clap for them that really usually is that well I changed my mind let us see you all peeking back through the door I you see I try to do things in a little better order and look what happens I wanted to make announcements first and then try to you know lift the service again with a song and then preach well you all knew we practi the song We're if you all keep it up we're going to take our hand clap back oh Lord please help me Jesus come back Holy Spirit Well Jesse's back praise [Applause] God so for a couple more days a few more weeks uh just one week and then you're back to California and then over the seas soon all right well we're going to pray and believe the Lord that uh God will be with him strengthen him every step of the way and and that the Lord will help poor sister Roda who is Left Behind here while her man is out there fighting for I mean training for the country uh I'm just kidding because I know that uh but just remember absence makes the heart grow fonder sometimes we need that when we're talking about Jesse but anyway moving right along all the more you know him the more you love him today sister P's birthday I realize sister Pam is not here today uh Casey's Mama uh you know they are attending another church but this is their church and I saw it on the calendar and I thought well she's still grieving the loss of her husband so let's pray she has a particularly blessed birthday today that God will be with her tomorrow is is our daughter-in-law's birthday Jenna and uh she is uh out of town in Texas visiting her parents and some friends that were going to be in town for a few days she's a brave girl to get on airplane with a bab 9-month old baby by herself but God was so gracious helped him every step of the way and there was a gentleman sitting beside her it didn't say a word the whole flight as the plane landed he looked over and said let me help you get your bag she said oh no no no that's all right he said please let me help you with your bags and get off the plane and we had prayed Tuesday night Lord send favor and somebody to be good to her along the way and he did and there was a an an agent there who checked a in who wouldn't charge her for her suitcase and you know that doesn't happen if you don't have some status so two times we saw the Lord answering your prayers on Tuesday night I'm thankful for that but tomorrow is her birthday and she'll be home later on on Tuesday to celebrate kade's going to be in Indiana for a meeting uh at his is home Church in Muny and next Sunday uh Friday leaving Thursday Friday Saturday and coming home Sunday and it's his birthday and nobody ought to have to travel on their birthday but uh he has to if he's going to get to Indiana and back and make his mama happy and I I understand how that

got to see it before we can do anything about it amen but when we see it we can we have authority over it when we see it we begin to have authority over it we can deal with it and we can give people in our lives permission to call us out hello a husband can say to his wife call me out you you can't get mad at her if you told her to call me out when you see me moving in anger because I want to have a right spirit before God you can have all the Revelation you can understand the mystery you can know why the prophet came you can get all the seals together you might even be one of those who thinks they've got all the Thunders but if you can't deal with those issues of offense and anger and bitterness and jealousy and resentment uh you haven't won the battle brother brandom didn't say the last battle the great battle that was going to be fought in the end time he didn't say it was going to be over the Mysteries he said the battlefield is going to be the battlefield of the mine he wasn't talking to the church world he was talking to the bride so isn't it good to know we've only got one more battle got one more and everything thing we deal with is it it surrounds it kind of comes around that one battle it's a mind battle your your problem is in your mind and your Victory is in your mind and the word of God defeats his enemy all the time under any circumstances Proverbs 4:23 says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of Life put away from thee a forward mouth uh and perverse lips put far from thee let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee Ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established turn not to the right hand nor nor the left come on remove thy foot from evil Lord Jesus we thank you that you have called us to be alert and you have called us to be sober to be vigilant the New Testament tells us because we have an adversary who roams about like a roaring lion seeking whom he can devour but you gave us the promise in your word greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world and we have a lion not one acting as a lion but we have a lion the The Lion of the tribe of Judah hath prevailed and he lives in this little bride and when we praise the Living God he Roars from our lungs it's the sound of the king when we praise you and when we press through our feeling and worship you anyway it's it's that lion who's sounding and roaring within us he gives us the victory because he is also the lamb that was slain before the foundation of the world come Lord Jesus and let your word find an anointed lodging place in our lives and we will give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the most lovely and exalted name name of the Lord Jesus Christ that we pray and the Saints said you may be seated thank you for uh all the time that you spent standing in the service this morning the word offense is from a Greek word scandalon and it means a stumbling block or a trap a snare and it actually means the place that you put the bait if you had a mouse trap for instance and there's that little place where you put the cheese and uh the the little mouse comes around to get that cheese and that place where the cheese would lay is the scandalon in Greek it means the bait the place where the bait is when you start looking at that and recognize that when we're reading through the scripture and we read the word offense for instance when Jesus talks about offense the word is where the cheese is laid where the bait is we've got an adversary who's got a bait out for us we have to make up our mind by the word of the Lord by the strength of the Holy Ghost within us that we are not going to take the devil's bait I want to hear somebody say Amen now you got to make up for all those folks that aren't here this morning with their amen somebody said we're going to be streaming somebody said we're going to be pulling from home well I don't hear you when you're at home but I hope I can feel you in a little while but we want to get somewhere this morning and when we look uh I don't want to spend a lot of time in a in a review but when we look at that word offense there's a a slew of synonyms do you still have those charity you could put those a slew of synonyms for the word offense because some people like to say well I'm not easily offended oh you're not well let's see if we can uh can pull up these synony annoyed are you easily annoyed I'm leaving a little time here for you to say oh me do you get angry resentment indignation irritation come on men exasperation come on women wrath displeasure disapproval dislike hard bad or ill feelings disgruntlement animosity vexation aversion opposition and enmity all synonyms words with similar meanings now offense is one thing to deal with but what we find out is that that Spirits run together I mentioned to you last Sunday that brother Brandon would sometimes be uh coming toward a prayer line and maybe already in a prayer line praying for somebody tell people if you particularly sense that a demon presence was there he would say bow your head and and because that demon when he comes out he's going to be looking for a place to go he's going to find a similar lodging place do you understand they know where they can go they know what kind of people are opened and what kind of people are closed in fact we hear brother Brandon more than once saying uh oh my what's that I'm paraphrasing I can read them if you need them uh oh my what's that he said there's a spirit over there crying out to a spirit over here he's looking for help we might say he's looking for reinforcement you know one spirit is I is might be easier to deal with but when they partner when they when they cooperate then you've got a bigger issue and we find that offense never likes to work alone and we're not talking about legitimately getting your feelings hurt legitimately somebody wrongs you legitimately you can be offended and not have a demon Spirit operating in your life I want you to know but if you are offended and it's not because there's an evil spirit trying to attack your life you've got to get rid of that thing now uh uh for instance we mentioned the scripture said be angry and send not let not the sun go down on your wrath which means you're going to get angry sometime but you've got to let that go that means we can't let it build overnight When the Sun Goes Down in the Hebrew it means a new day has begun you and I look at a new day when the sun comes up but the Bible and Hebrew scripture looks at a new day when the sun goes down and the morning and the evening evening the evening and the morning were the first day and the evening and the morning were the second day so when that sun goes down you got to turn loose of that anger you've got to forgive who has legitimately wronged you and hurt your feelings so that when you get out of the bed the next morning it's gone well you act like it's easy I don't remember saying it was easy have you ever slept on it and woke up the next morning preach and still had something to deal mhm yes oh yes and uh you know we think sometime our answer is to stay away from folks but you don't have to have nobody around you on to Stew come on De simmer you and you you you you know me myself and I we can do a lot simmering and and and regurgitating and you know all this stuff and gets on it us so as Believers these things are going to come Jesus said you better know offenses are going to come and as we reach the end of the end they're going to come more often and and he said but just make sure you're not the one doing the offending he said it I'm paraphrasing but he said it so what we look at is we find that there are three categories of partnering spirits that operate with offense uh the first category is the self-centered nature of offense you see the reality is we are easily offended because we are focusing on ourselves it's not all about you I love saying that it's not all about me it's not all about you this is a big old world I don't want to hurt your feelings and and be a and and you be offend Ed and leave here with an offense but the reality is we don't want you to go but if you pass from this life uh tomorrow we're going to cry we're going to the loss will be great but the reality is the sun's going to rise and it's going to set and life has to go on whether we want it to or not it has to go on it doesn't all center around you and once we realize that we will begin to understand that offense is really an issue sometime of just focusing on our own feelings instead of thinking about somebody else and these are the characteristics of someone who has a fence that is rooted with a self-centered nature easily provoked prideful Behavior self-focus Uh second category the stronghold of B Bess if your offense has brought you into the realm of bitterness brother brandham talks about bitterness don't you ever let that root of bitterness spring up in your life he said when you do that when you take on those things you you are shutting yourself out of the Kingdom that's pretty heavy words isn't it uh and and underneath that is bitterness holding grudges and unforgiveness you've got to let it go and then number three there are those who operate with a with a spirit of offense and it behaves with isolation misinterpretation gossip slander and this causes Division if there's ever been an hour Church where we need to be together it's now we need a Unity that can't be uh manufactured a Unity that only the Holy Spirit can bring when we make up our minds to live the unoffendable life is it really possible to live an unoffendable life it is but it's an ascended life and that doesn't mean some Eastern mysticism it means getting up above your stuff it means being who God called you to be and anointed you with a flying eagle anointing and that flying eagle anointing wants to lift you up above your hurt your father issues your mama issues your come on your past we got to get past our past we've got to deal with stinking thinking we've got to realize the way to win this mind battle is to meditate on the word of the Lord the truth of the hour what God has given us let somebody squeeze out an amen even if it hurts you get it squeezed out would you and so we're talking about the first of the spirits a and it's anger and I'm going to just read the one one scripture and then move to the new material this morning Proverbs 14 17 King James he that is soon angry dealth foolishly and a man of wicked devices is hated Amplified handles it this way and this is the this really needs to be said because this is how anger operates the Greek word there soon angry I is is a word as you might have read in the devotional this week it is a word that means to foam up quickly when I think of that I think of being a kid in in third grade and making a volcano did anybody make a volcano you might not have made it in third grade maybe you were Advanced and you did it in kindergarten or something I don't know but whenever you did it you pour lots of baking soda in and then you put that down in the volcano and when it's time to make your presentation you pour vinegar on it isn't that what we did you pour vinegar on it and guess what it Foams up quickly this is the same reaction it's a chemical reaction that causes that and scientifically when we look at brain science we find out that it's sort of a chemical reaction that causes us to react in Anger it Foams up quickly he who Foams up quick ly you're going to foam up you're going to be angry sometime but you don't want to be somebody who flies off the handle we say in the South you don't want to be somebody who Foams up quickly you want to be somebody who is in control let me tell you this our emotions are not our enemy your soul life is not your enemy God gave you your emotions so that you might be able to make contact with your environment you need them you need to be you need to have emotion uh brother brandom talks about religion with no emotion he said it's dead he said that's no more than a like a rut being in a rut and he said a rut is no more than a than a grave with both ends kicked out of it he said if it's got life if your religion has life it's going to have some emotion to it amen did you hear that out there it's going to have a little Al you're not going to come to church like you're dead your preacher is not going to act dead worship leader it's not going to act like a six-foot icicle blocking a good picture in the baptistry he's going to get under the spirit of what he's doing that's what brother brandom said John I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and that's why he had a vision that's why he could write for us through a scribe the book of the Revelation because he got in the spirit of what he was called to do every one of us are called To Worship in order to worship like God intended and that's scriptural that's what is worship like God intended is scriptural worship you want to know what that looks like read the book of Psalms The Book of Psalms tells us what Godly biblical worship looks like we don't get to choose it we don't get to say I'm an introvert we don't get to say I'm a quiet person I don't show any emotion we don't don't get to do that we do it exactly like the Bible said it or we don't do it at all you don't have to always be loud but the Bible give there's nine forms of davidic Praise mentioned in the Book of Psalms one of them has to do with the posture of the body you C you can certainly sit and worship you don't have to be standing all the time to worship Bible mentions that you can lay prostrate on the floor in worship you do that in some of our churches they're going to have the deacons come and and collect you because they're not going to know what you're doing but we were here just at our fellowship meeting and one of the former Amish brother laid down in the aisle on his belly well he's got biblical order for that he prostrated himself not prostate prostrate it's there's a difference believe me he prostrated himself right there on the floor in the presence of God and Worship the Lord and he has every right to do it and any church that wouldn't allow somebody to exercise biblical praise needs to be shook but you don't have to do that and then the Bible mentions standing tells us tells us we can use our voices we can sing we can use a loud voice did you know the Bible said praise the Lord with a loud voice so if you're nervous you better get over your nervous Ness because heaven is going to be a noisy place and if you miss it the only other alternative is going to be louder than that so you better get your nerves under control if you don't like shouting you better not get on my cloud because when I gave the Lord my heart at s years old 50 years ago I gave in my heart he filled me with the Holy Ghost it's been genuine and real to me ever since now that doesn't mean the flame hadn't flickered but it's never gone out by the grace of God the Bible helps us and he tells us you can use your hands to clap you can use your hands to raise before the Lord and you can use your hands to play instruments so the Bible tells us how we should praise him and when we praise him we create an atmosphere for the word to go forth and not only be preached with power but that it might be received with the Effectiveness in our individual lives anger means foaming up quickly you don't want that you don't want to deal foolishly in life because you can't be trusted because you're quick to fly off the handle you just don't want that at all let's catch what brother random said in the resurrection of Jesus can you take me since I read this last Sunday can you go all the way down to the place where he said the human heart was made to be happy see it there in the middle of the screen the human heart was made to be happy worry will cause cancer temper will cause cancer don't oh don't you just wish this was easy to do you just want to say yes sir and always do it but it's not always easy but he said don't ever be upset we're failures seems like before we get started but we can control that you see we're supposed to control our emotions instead of our emotions controlling us why because we're a word-based people we're not living by the sway of this world we're living under the influence of the revealed word of God somebody ought to say amen and that makes you behave a little differently than the world around you behaves amen don't never be upset just walk in his love there's a key there walk in his love amen if you'll just go down he said no KN that you're walking in him nothing can harm you there's nothing can harm you neither Powers things present things future nothing can separate us from him we're in him as brother Hawk was praying this morning and we never come in by our own will he by choice elected us and brought us into him amen now we know predestination is by forn knowledge you did make a choice but he knew your choice before the foundation of the world and he set you up that's what the word word predestination means prefixed Destiny before you ever come here God knew what your choice would be and he placed you your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life not the night you got saved but before you ever showed up in this world is't that good now look at James 1 with me just a moment here James 1:8 uh I think I might have read 19 and 20 but let's do 18 through through 21 now of his own will his will he begat us with the word of Truth by his choice he birthed Us by the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures now how many of you know Jesus was a first fruits first fruits of the Resurrection I don't know what you believe but I believe brother brandham was a type of a first fruit because as far as I know in this generation or we could say dispensation he was the first son that I know of to come to maturity that's just real simple he won the battle he had a lot of battles he had a wife that didn't always understand the call that was on his heart I'll tell you what some folks won't tell you she had some issues she was left alone to raise the children and then preach that when she got when when he got home you remember she let the little kids cut their bangs that would probably be nothing in in the day we're living in now around the message ranks but once upon a time we we knew what he said keep the scissors out of your hair real simple just keep them out that means bangs ends uh inet whatever just live by a simple rule and don't compromise or you'll look like some of the Jackson Camp yeah right it right they' just inch at a time until there's nothing left that's not what we've been taught in this word or in this m you still here I I I didn't know if you'd hung up on me or not truth is the truth but you know Sister M she let the girls cut these little bangs put their scissors that you you can't do it without scissors so they cut those little bangs and made those little flybacks they used to like and and I don't know what brother brand said to her privately he said but I know what he said from the pool pit he said I don't like that he said I wish you wouldn't do wouldn't do that she didn't always understand I was one time standing in the den uh brother George Smith has been here he's heard me tell this he was in the room room and sister Rebecca was still alive and we were having a great conversation and uh somebody mentioned brother Brandon what did he ever get upset about things in family and in life and she said well yes he he was a normal man he he was a he was a normal husband does that shock you uh he he had the same kind of quirks and feelings that anybody else has he said so himself he talks about his own complexes you're not the only one that's got a complex I'm not he had some too give me just a moment my lips are getting sticky so somebody I I don't remember if I asked the question or not I don't think I did I think someone said well what kind of things would upset brother Brandon and with my own ears I heard it she sister Rebecca said well he was pretty particular about his toast toast yeah he come on now he locked it a certain color would you have wouldn't you left to have traveled in time and got brother brandom a toaster like we have today and sent it back all digitalized it's bad when you have to say honey come here I can't use the toaster got screens and all kind of little things on it I don't know how to set the thing but but maybe brother brandom could have could have punched the color he wanted on his toast but I know this I know yesterday my wife made me some eggs two eggs lord it's all we could afford to eat I like three but I thought I better save them uh and and she said well I I looked at the plate there was only one egg there I didn't say anything and she said oh I got another one coming she said I I uh uh broke the Yol on the first one well I've eaten Broken Yolk eggs but I don't like them I like over easy eggs or over medium eggs and I don't know that I would have pitched a tantrum over it but I sure did appreciate her knowing that if I had a rather I would rather my egg yolk not be broken you get it brother Brandon would rather his toast not be burnt and she said sometimes he'd get a little little agitated with Mama because the toast was overdone she said that wasn't a knock down drag out or anything like that uh somebody said well did he raise his voice she said well uh why do you tell that brother I've been told by ministers you shouldn't tell that why you made him more than a man and when you found out he wasn't perfect in recall you left him but those of us who realize from the start that God always uses men none of whom are perfect none of them who have perfect recall when you get that in your goat when you really know that by understanding then when you come across something that was maybe told a little different or played out a little different it doesn't shake you off because you have let him be a man let him be human and it's important to do so because if not you and I won't think we can ever make it but there was a there was one in our generation thanks be to God who became a first fruits and if you understand the concept of first fruits the priest would go out into the looking for grain that had become aib in Hebrew which means ripe and and he would find a little patch of it and he'd say this is ripe here this is a be and he would cut that and tie it together and on the on the time of first fruits uh just after Passover he would wave that out in the field he would wave that mature grain before the Lord and he would say in the the same manner that this grain has become mature May the grace of God be upon the field so that the rest of the grain will also come to its maturity so that in that regard brother Brandon was sort of like a first fruits in his day a mature son w we saw his life we saw his ministry we saw his humanity and we have hope since we know we don't have a high priest who can't be touched we have one that can be touched we have hope that even as he struggled to get there you and I may have a journey but the same God that perfected his truth in that vessel is able to bring every one of us to our place of adoption completion and maturity that'd be a good place to say amen amen so he said of of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man let every man and every wo man be swift to hear you know I want to just say this you know what that means that means you can't be thinking of what you're going to say when I'm talking to you and when you're talking to me I can't be thinking about my answer this conversation may take longer than you think it should because I'm supposed to hear you before I answer you do you know how to know oh this is going to get so sticky do you know how to know if someone is hearing you or if they're just contemplating their answer if they're contemplating their answer they're always going to lead their answer with well I know watch and usually after well I know there's going to be a big old buut excuse me in the way I hope that's not too carnal for you spiritual folks it's going to usually be followed by the word but well I know but well I heard you but no you didn't hear you weren't listening you were getting your answer ready you can't communicate with somebody who won't hear you we've got to hear one another we have got to be swift to hear and slow to speak if you'll do that five minutes of conversation with each other you'll get more said by listening to the other party that doesn't mean just just in a disagreement it just means in life if husbands would take time to listen to their wives instead of forming an excuse or an answer hear them and then speak back and then Vice versy you know what that means we wouldn't have the conflict that we have in our homes just a minute Amen brother shell we wouldn't have the conflict we have in our friendships and in even our church relationships we've got to hear each other what do you pre I'm just preaching the book slow to speak and don't foam up quickly don't overreact control your emotions amen for the wrath of man the anger of man the hotess of man the agitation of man worketh not the righteousness of God now if you think you can't make it you can't overcome that you can't whip that you're forgetting verse 21 look at it with me would you wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness boy those are Big King words aren't they and superfluity of naughtiness and receive here's some you might catch with meekness the the what glance this way just a minute when you can with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your soul your soul according to the Bible is your mind your will and your emotions did you know that the word of God that has been engrafted into your life is there to save you in the area of your mind your will and your emotions so God is asking you to be to be swift to hear slow to speak slow to boil up and when you think I can't do that I'm just a human I I got so much stress in my life and so much anxiety he comes around and says then whereby lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the word the engrafted word which is able to save your mind will and emotions your soul now that word engrafted in Greek is INF futos and it means inborn a word inborn in you implanted by Nature implanted by others instruction boy that brings up an argument Among Us in the message doesn't it when did the seed get there well it had to be there before he could it could manifest that we know we believe there was a representation of God in you before you were born because he knew you before the foundation of the world but we also believe what brother brandom said when he's speaking about the woman at the well she received the seed of the word as she sat on her mother's knee and heard the instructions of truth but the reason why that word that her mother shared with her had effect in her life is because there was already a representation of God's forn knowledge in her so you've got to have something there so that when it falls it falls in a right place or you will shed it like the world around you you believe what you believe today because you came here wired to receive it but somebody had to bring it to you some tape had to get it some preacher had to get it to you some witness had to get it to you Hallelujah and you didn't do like the little lady who threw the seal book in my face you received it because there was something in you there was a representation in you that right there just that ought to be enough to make you shout your shoes right off your feet the very grace of God the very mercy of God with tens of thousands of people spurning and rejecting truth around us God let little oh you hear that truth and not just say Amen with your tongue but say Amen with your life I've been looking at that word in John 3:16 in the Greek uh whosoever believeth I've been looking at that word believeth in the original Greek and I've been finding out that it means even more than believe it actually is a an indication in Greek of a continual process which the modern Church would never have you to believe they would want you to believe if you believe it once that's all you have to do but that word doesn't just mean once and for all once and done I'm just telling what the word means the word actually means and continuously choose to believe it is good because that's what the book said and that's exactly how it goes many people can believe up here that Jesus died on the cross and go on and live like hell no matter what they believe but he who really believes is somebody who chooses to acknowledge it not once and then forget it but continues to choose to stay attached to that truth how many of you are still fighting this good fight of Faith as a Christian because you didn't just believe it and throw it away you continue even on a Monday hey Hallelujah to believe it to Fellowship it now I want to tell you this I hope you get this I hope you like it I like this and if you don't like it don't tell me that word engrafted inudo inborn implanted by Nature implanted by others instruction to implant or incorporate something in a permanent way you who have received an engrafted word that engrafted word becomes a part of you engrafted means drawing now you drawing life from it it drawing life from you that's what it means and in medicine it means something even more special in medicine the word engrafted refers oh good we we I passed it to her in medicine engraftment mean refers to the process of new cells working properly and rebuilding the immune system after a transplant when someone has received an organ transplant that's what this is talking about there are new cells working properly rebuilding the immune system in your body so that your body will continue to receive the organ or else it goes into what rejection mode and there are many times when an organ is initially received later rejected by the body and has to be removed and that's okay if you've got a dozen waiting on you but if you don't you can be in some pretty serious trouble in fact people have died because their body rejected the only choice they had for an organ at that time let's go on to look at this it is the beginning of the recovery process white blood cells are the first cells to engraft followed by red blood cells and platelets now let's look at this again just a little more just a little deeper here engraftment is when the blood forming cells you received on transplant day so before you receive the organ as you are receiving the organ they they give you blood forming cells also not your own sometimes in the form of an anti-rejection cocktail they call it which is both medicine and and blood cells those blood cells that you received on transplant day start to grow they're not your own cells they were given to you and they start making healthy blood cells isn't that amazing it's an important milestone in transplant recovery once you get to that place one more paragraph about it the cells you received on transplant day uh know where they belong in your body oh my oh my oh my they move through your blood stream into your bone marrow and when these cells begin to grow and make new blood cells guess what is called engraftment now let's go back to what Paul said James excuse me sorry wherefore lay apart all filthiness superfluity of naughtiness and receive with meekness the engrafted word how many of you have had an organ transplant I have spiritually he said I the the prophet of the Old Testament prophesied I'll take your Stony heart Hallelujah and I will engraft in you you my Living Word and my Living Word transplanted into your life will bring renewal and regeneration to your Fallen human spirit and I will not just pass my word over you but I will make it a part of who you are it's an engrafted word that we have receed so brother sister amen we can overcome offense and anger and bitterness and jealousy not because we're superheroes but because we have a word that has been engrafted it has stimulated in us a new kind of cell it has transformed us from needy to sufficient this word has what has this word has praise His name I'm I'm going to fly look at Galatians 5:23 because that word meekness is there receive with meekness the engrafted word which is able to save your souls now you can know what save your souls means the the engrafted word has the ability to transform your mind I claim it I claim that I stand on that promise someone recently sent me a note of encouragement and said brother Shelly thank you for speaking up about mental illness because it's a taboo subject in the church church I don't know what's doing that but I want you to know that there is a mental unwellness in people in this age in this hour like we have never seen it before and it is not to be ashamed of it is not to to hide from it is most likely the results of hurts and wounds and wrong programming and past issues that weigh so heavy in our lives that it produces anxiety it produces depression come on panic attacks I don't remember what the percentage was but it was shockingly high I heard a statistic this week on the news of how many women of a certain age are on medication to balance them out not hormonally but emotionally and mentally because of the high levels of anxiety and depression in their lives and and I think it was something like three and five three and five depending on now now here's the kicker longterm if you you need help get it but don't look to that prescription as your long-term solution the long-term solution is to step back and let that engrafted word begin to produce healthiness and wholeness in your body and it can do that as you water the word and how do we water the word by coming into his presence it's not just hearing the preaching we have to do it's daily entering into the presence of the Lord by engaging the word by engaging him in praise and worship by visiting what we believe two times a week is not enough to remain spiritually strong and emotionally and mentally healthy there are some skinny folks in this house but I don't believe it's because you only eat physical food twice a week we have to have daily sustenance nutrition for our body and we spiritually I know it's an old worn out cliche I know people are about tired of hearing it but brother brandham just simplifies it and says a Christian is going to read his Bible every day and pray and and I can hear the wheels are turning but he didn't have four children to take care of and he when he said that and he he wasn't a homeschool mom and he wasn't a dad who worked 50 hours a week let me tell you something if you have not yet understood the life and death importance of the word you will you will eventually realize it but you may be too frazzled too emotionally disturbed and mentally ill to do anything about it if you keep putting off what we have to have daily folks know they don't we know we don't get the vitamins and minerals that we used to get from our food and yet there are some people so spiritually you know high on the pole that they think it' be just a shame to take a multivitamin you know that would just be and it's so expensive and it's let me tell you something you'll have plenty of money to buy yourself a multivitamin if you quit buying so many potato chip and candy bars and $7 coffee drinks so please don't tell me that a that a multivitamin and a mineral supplement is too much and cost too much money it's a lie get rid of some of your subscriptions cut out Netflix and Hulu and uh and Apple TV and Disney plus and whatever else next thing you know you're spending $200 don't mention the cable bill that's another 200 bucks just about you'll have plenty of money to buy better food and eat and take some supplementation if you need to and if you don't don't pretend to be more spiritual than somebody else understand it's the same way in the spirit we have to keep feeding and nourishing praise the lord it's true receive it with meekness he said the engrafted word now we got to understand uh here Galatians 523 he's talking about uh these beautiful things that we need in our life the fruits of the spirit meekness Temperance against such there is no law you've got to have meekness to receive the engrafted word you can't be a knit all oh I'm preaching you ain't running the aisle but I'm still preaching you've got to have some some humility to receive this engrafted word you've got to humble yourself you you well I I you know I couldn't listen to much of that uh why you know he didn't even have a barely a grammar school education you don't have to have a grammar school education to be meek and if you'll be meek God will give you the engrafted word I guess you see those posts that people are making all the time uh if if the pastor doesn't have a a a a doctorate of theology it's a false Church well I want you to know somebody's lost their mind because that disqualifies just about everybody in the book Paul was maybe the most intelligent in the in the New Testament and he had to forget most of what he knew to be able to be the greatest Apostle the world has ever known I'm not against Bible study I'm not against an education that's not what I'm preaching but if you think your qualification for Ministry is in a a a frame on your wall then Moses is disqualified because although he did get the education of Egypt he had to go to the backs side of the desert to get rid of it and Paul remember he had to go down and get rid of some of what he learned so that God and that's the meekness that it requires it's the humility that it required you've got to be willing to to to say hey I may know something up here in my head that doesn't make it so we're living in an hour now where we know just because somebody knows it doesn't mean it's true there is an engrafted word that can only be received with meekness not Hess I'm going to catch him I can't wait to catch him in a mistake I'm I I I just can't wait to catch him in in that's not meekness that's pompus party God will do for you what he did for old Saul of Tarsus he'll meet you on the road to Damascus and knock you off your high horse he knows how to get our attention and when he does we don't need to meet him with some lofty words or superfluity of naughtiness we need to receive with meekness the engrafted word somebody ought to thank God for the truth and it takes that meekness and let me just run down this real quick let's look at what meekness means because some people do not know what it means some people think me meekness is weakness some people think meekness is and indeed it is not in the original language it means gentleness mildness by implication humility having a mild submissive Spirit somebody said that must be talking to women no it's talking to all of God's children we all have to be submissive to the word we do we have to have some help with our will remember this engrafted word is able to save your soul your soul is made up of mind will and emotion we've got to be willing to Bow our will and receive his will his mind his leadership those of you that have gone ahead in the assignment you know already that it means avoids unnecessary harshness I was doing really well until I got to that phrase and my transparency for the day is this I have a problem with unnecessary harshness sometimes I use it as humor as sarcasm but it doesn't always have the right effect if I want to be meek before the Lord and before his people I've Got to Now not not in you know not necessarily in preaching because if you don't have boldness and a little bit of authority in the preaching in this hour you'll never catch anybody's attention because they're they're already W that you're sitting there I see you sometime you don't even have your phone in your hand and your thumb's working you honestly think that you can get me to move on by by thumbing me I'm not moving on till I'm done amen I'm not under contract here I'm under a responsibility but I'm not talking about pit mannerism I'm talking about an everyday life I'm talking about with my own family I'm talking about just an agitation ill irritation some people get on my nerves with their question s you don't have to raise your hand in the room if you know it's you and a and I want the Lord to help me and I want to have strength to help myself because the reality is most of the time if I if I can catch myself I'm not angry I I'm not really trying to drive home a point I have just somehow adopted This Heart harness I'm not the only one I I but I am not uh talking about anybody but me right now and that's not Meek a a and if that can hinder me from receiving the full engrafted word I want to ask the Lord and I want your prayer I want to be uh open and transparent before you I don't want to be harsh if I don't need to be sometime you have to be sometime you have to say no and you have to mean it but if I don't have to be I I would rather be another way I don't know if you're quiet because you feel sorry for me quiet because you've been victim of me or or quiet because you can't believe I'm saying but I need to say that because I know that sometimes we need just realness so that we can deal with our own stuff well well you're preaching to yourself how does that feel well it's not fun but it's part of the the calling it's also my responsibility to let this word work in me amen pray for me and I'm going to pray for you that we would now now listen it says avoids unnecessary harshness and I know by saying that that I will be reminded a dozen times this week by people who may not remember what else I preached but will now remember Stacy Mariah Olivia Joshua Benjamin will now remember that one little phrase and call me out but it's part of what we need now here is this I didn't make this up I didn't add this this is part of the full definition of the word does not mean will weak weekness doesn't mean weakness but rather strength under control somebody say help us Lord Matthew 5:5 blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the Earth are you with me Galatians 61 Brethren if a man be overtaken in a vault ye who which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted I don't have time to preach that to break that down in the in the Greek but I had a wonderful time yesterday I spent all day long in this word and I broke this down but it wouldn't we wouldn't have the time to hit it this morning but I love I love the meaning of that overtaken in a fall it it it's uh it's it's a word that can mean uh surprise it's a word that can mean caught up to if a man has been caught up to by a fa that has been chasing him instead of saying I Told You So ye which are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be caught up surprised by by the thing that's been chasing you lest you also be ain't that interesting Ephesians 4:2 with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love how do we receive the engrafted word in meekness Colossians 3:12 put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies kindness humbleness of Mind meekness and longsuffering that doesn't sound like somebody foaming up with anger all the time hello spitting and sputtering flying off the handle quick reaction I need some more omes thank you sister Flo James 1:22 and 23 this is the next two verses I wanted you to see the the continuity and context of the scripture the verse before this says with meekness receive the engrafted word which is able to save your soul now the next verse says but be ye isn't it interesting but be ye doers James 1:22 be you doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves I sat under the word bless God that was some kind of sermon it wasn't if you don't determine to try to practice it I need amens I'm sorry I am I'm I'm I didn't mean right then uh but I'm just I'm sorry I somebody say if you had more anointing you would need amens that may be right pray for me but I just grew up in an atmosphere been preaching 50 years uh pastoring since I was 17 still don't do it well but I'm certainly not no longer a novice at it and uh I have always needed somebody to nod or and it gets worse as people's ADHD kicks in in 2025 and they they're they're little attension span is so short we we would have to well if the service wasn't so long well we'd have to have one every day if I broke down a Sunday sermon it' take three three other services are you are you ready for that or can you sit through one long one on Sunday and an average one on Tuesday night and yet I have people tell me every week I went I've heard the I've heard Sunday sermon three times how does somebody hear a Sunday sermon three times in a week somebody who wants to catch it all and you say I wouldn't have time to do that let me tell you something you forget your drive and you're listening to podcast and Weather Channel and Fox News you could be listening to the word not trying to be religious just trying to remind you you can make time for what you want to make time for just stop playing one board game on game night just one week just one night of the week give give one one game night a month now now people talk about movie Nights well let me tell you something 30 years ago in this message nobody talked about a movie night nobody talked about a movie night they didn't talk about Christmas trees either and Valentine's parties not 30 years ago but now they talk about movie Nights give up give them all up if you if you can but give give up one a month somebody said all we watch is Andy Griffin give up Barney for one night and rehearse again hear again a word that God is sending to try to get us ready for the authority of the full adopted Sons sir it's worth it church it's worth it be you hearers be your doers of the word and not hears only for let me see what time it is yes for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he's like into a man beholding his natural face in a glass he goes off and forgets what he sees here's how the spirit of anger Works anger fuels offense leading to rash decisions and spiritual blindness well I just ain't going back to church that's a big decision for a for a for a flash of moment you're going to make some d I'm just going to quit my job because nobody there appreciates me that's a bad decision until you think it through CU somebody's got to pay your bill and it ain't GNA be me and all of us don't have Rich daddies and mamas you better know but the atmosphere is just so bad uh let me tell you something very few people work in in in a church atmosphere unless they work for a church just because it's bad there don't mean it ain't going to be bad somewhere else and well the language is just so bad folks people are foulmouthed and filthy mouthed in this generation when my family was was smaller and my girls were younger and we're sitting in a restaurant and and people would start using foul language many times I have turned around and said hey this is my wife these are my daughters can you use nicer language or say your language a little little softer because they've never heard those words I don't say them in front of them and they don't know those words I've told you some of the experiences one time we were down the beach and uh we were sitting right by the water I found if you just get right down at the water you don't have to see his M but the water we don't go when it's crowded but this was the time that we I had to be there and we were down by the water and there was a big group of one of the colleges had a break and there was a big group of them behind us and they were just carrying on like foolishness and I just walked back and of course my wife she's just about to die and my girl my family they're just about to dig holes in the sand and hide and I understand now they just hated to see me shot right on the beach but back then I did it didn't matter and I just walked up and I said you know what you all are here to have a good time nice time I'm here to have nice time you think there's any possibility you could clean up your your language just a little bit I don't want to have to explain to my children what some of those words mean they're not old enough to hear them and you know what every one of them said yes sir yes sir yes sir I'm so sorry yes sir I'm so I'm so sorry they respected that I went back and sat down and of course my family's M I can't believe you did that I can't believe you did that you EMB us a birad a little while later here come one of them with his chair I didn't go up there to make a friend he come down with his chair put his chair right beside me and said you mind if I sit with you I said well go right ahead he said you see my daddy's a Church of God preacher and he would be ashamed of me if he heard me using the kind of language I was using right up there he said to come down here I traded out my my my uh beer for a Diet Coke because he'd be ashamed of me to know and then a little while later we just sit quietly then he starts pouring his life out caught up in a wrong swirl needed somebody to remind him who he was that's that's the reality of a lot of folks around us if we're acting like them and talking like them and doing what they do we're going to make them comfortable my Ministry is not to make them comfortable it's to make them miserable and then offer them a way out isn't that right here's how that Spirit of anger works it fuels offense leading to rash decisions and spiritual blindness offense often arises when individuals hold on to anger instead of choosing forgiveness and discretion anger is often a response to unresolved offense it can lead to wrath and Malice hindering [Music] peace and Reconciliation are you with me Proverbs 16:32 few more minutes he that is slow to anger is better than the mighty and he that ruleth his Spirit than he that taketh the city you want to be a hero you want you want to be a a a some body rule your own Spirit control your anger and the reason why we don't want to maintain an offended heart is because an offended heart is the breeding ground of deception Proverbs 19:11 in the Amplified says good sense makes a man restrain his anger and it is his glory to overlook a transgression or offense we need less temper and more Temperance Galatians 5:22-23 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law did I get him out of order charity I may have the word Temperance in the Greek means self self control how many of you want to be exercising self-control you put your fist through the wall you slammed a door and the glass broke you raised your arm and your family flinched that's not Temperance that's uncontrolled temper you yelled at the little wife that you claim to love you snatch your children by the elbow you mistreat the dog because you're angry that's not Temperance that's temper you threw a chair across the kitchen my goodness you need jail you need bars you need an overnight locked away that's not Temperance that's temper Temperance is self-control the virtue of one who Masters his desires and passions if you can't control your desires and Passions you will surely find a road yielding to lust and when lust has finished it brings forth unbelief and sin and adultery and fornication Temperance it's a fruit of the spirit Restraint of one's emotions impulses or desires Temperance God help us look at second Peter uh chapter 1 verse 5-8 you'll be familiar with this and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge remember this is not a head knowledge this is a knowing this is a knowing and Mary knew no man Mary conceived of a baby knowing no man that wasn't head knowledge that was intimate knowledge that's the kind of knowledge we're talking about here an intimate knowledge have you been intimate with the word have you opened up your life good question and allowed the word of God to overshadow your life are you willing to change your opinions your decisions because the word says something different that's knowledge add to your knowledge Temperance self-control and to Temperance patience not quick to boil to foam and to patience godliness brother brandom said that is to be just like God somebody said that's impossible it can't be impossible if the word encourages it it may not be easy but nothing worth having is cheaper free we got to work to get to that place somebody said I thought it wasn't by works no it's by faith and faith is demonstrated by works are you still here good I need 20 more minutes or so when or so that's a that's that's a variable or so a a and and to patience godliness and to Godliness brother of kindness you know what I'm going to say don't you cuz I've said it so many times in these 30 plus years that I've preached to some of you when I first heard brother brandom preaching the stature of a perfect man because I had read this scripture in Peter many many many many many many times and it never hit me like this until I heard brother brandom sit preaching it in the statute of the perfect man that to be Godly is to be just like God and then the scripture says and to Godliness you've got to add something to your godliness you are living a life that manifests God and you still got to add something to that wouldn't you have thought that would have been the top of the top of the top godliness and yet the scripture said and to Godliness you got to add something what brotherly kindness is higher on the stature of a perfect man we we uh he placed it on the pyramid so that you can see it uh getting higher and honing more narrow at the top so once you have seen that birthing into godliness where you're behaving like God somebody said that's just far-fetched and out out out of possibility oh no no no no no no no no no you have received the engrafted word the engrafted word is working on you your body is preparing itself to receive that word that God has attached to you and if we yield to the word instead of our emotion if we yield to the word instead of our past if we yield to the word instead of our excuses well I've always handled it like that before that was then I told you about the song that brother lenel wrote and sent to me this week where he talks about uh loving people and telling your children you love them and how how uh how hard is it to stoop over and love your children and love people around you and tell them you love them because you don't know how much longer you're going to have them and that line in the chorus that he wrote talks about uh and don't just tell me I was raised that way because that was then this is now you know what that means church are you looking this way are you hearing me you know what that means it means we got to quit making those kinds of excuses well my mama didn't never tell me she let my dad didn't hug me my my that's ever more the reason that is ever more the reason why you and I need to go higher than our parents what about my kids don't like it tough well my kids are grown tough love them anyway well I don't want to embarrass them oh wait till they come in the house then bear hug them let them know Well they're going to think I've lost my mind good reality they already think that now they're going to have proof love them you that have little babies coming or you that are carrying little baby tell them all the time tell them now do what I did and talk to mama's belly you are wanted you are loved you are going to manifest the promises of God for your life this is your daddy talking get used to my voice you're going to hear it every day for the first 30 years I wish do you think that has any effect on a baby in the womb absolutely read the scripture over them and don't quit don't get shy when they're grown Speak Life give them a father's blessing a mother is the Fifth Gospel but it does not replace the blessing of a father a father speaking to his children blessing his children speaking life into his children and the reason why we won't do it is because we're not walking in meekness and Temperance we're walking in offense and anger and we don't want to be called out by our own family as Hypocrites sometime so we neglect what we ought to do because we can't control what we do you almost seem like you're mad not at all I'm just a passionate fell I've told some of these former Amish who come and worship with us every other month and I speak to them uh other times on the phone and and they Dro by at different time and and some of them have said to me you know we didn't grow up in that kind of environment and I said build a new environment make a new atmosphere it's not part of our culture not part of our nature that was then this is now it's it's it's well anyway we shouldn't even have to talk like this to Godliness brotherly kindness how is it possible you're just like God and still you need something more right because you can have all of God and the characteristics of God in your heart and still not come to a place where you treat your brother right so he's saying as you come into the fullness of being like God don't forget that he's here or there your brother's right in front of you how can you say you love a God that you can't see when you don't know how to treat your brother that you do see am I still your preacher am I fired godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity which is love King James uses the word charity here and it throws people off sometime because they think that means taking a you know a box of oranges to the neighbor or giving to the Goodwill no no no no no no no this is love this is perfect love this is Godly love this is necessary love now let's look at a few places in the message and we'll be done I still have 30 minutes but I won't take a all if you help me with what time we have left verse foundationally paragraph 65 Blasphemous names first foundationally is Faith second add to your faith virtue to your virtue Knowledge from knowledge Temperance from Temperance patience patience godliness and from godliness Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and then love being the Capstone seven of those seven Church agenes Seven Stars of the church es and all of it tempered together by the Holy Spirit there's the key that is the key folks we don't have enough of the Holy Ghost what am I supposed to do about that keep coming for a refill Lord fill me fill me that today fill me well I won't be in church tomorrow fill me anyhow right here in the laundry room come spirit of God and and and fill up every cell in my body we need him tempered together by the Holy Spirit now that's what it takes to become a servant of Christ Christ builds his church in seven Church ages his bride a person woman Church seven Church ages constitute and make the bride some out of this age some out of that age some out and all together shaping like a pyramid let's go on shaping like a pyramid the next 220 stature of a perfect man and Temperance Oh my he said we've come to Temperance now you've had Faith first you have to have that to begin with then you add virtue to your faith if it's the right kind of virtue which is not just power it's also character The Virtuous Woman didn't mean a powerful woman necessarily she will be she will be a powerful woman if those virtues that are mentioned are demonstrated in her life but that virtue is not just strength and power that virtue is also character add character to your faith if it's the right kind of virtue then you add knowledge and if it's the right kind of knowledge now you're going to add what Temperance stay with me just another moment hold your thumb still you can't scroll the preacher Temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol you know the temperance movement well where did they get that word self-control there's not a person in this room that wouldn't enjoy a couple of hours of not caring about anything it is the truth but I'm not just going to get drunk I I'm going to exercise self-control there's got to be another way I know the way it's coming into the presence of the Lord It's believing what the word said it's it but you got to keep it doing it it's a it's a constant Choice amen he said temperates doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol here no no Temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure not in this case this is Bible Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance that's just one of the lust of the flesh but we're talking about Holy Spirit Temperance that means how oh oh you want to know how brother brandom defined it somebody read it I I just can't read it how to control your tongue not be a Tattler you're like a rattler if you're a tadler got Venom how to control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks cross to you oh oh my they cut me off oh my they got their Whopper before me oh my they stole my parking plate your name on it did they cut in front of you they probably did the reality is this though folks they've got fuses out there without the Holy Ghost the world around us has fuses about that long you might ought to be careful not just women that'll not just men that'll talk to you like a saor there's women out there it's getting worse all the time not just fly boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started aren't we talk about going up no no no aren't we see then we wonder why God is not in the church not in his church doing Miracles and things that used to do and these and add Temperance to it oh temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoken to you how to hold on to your mind instead of giving it all away one piece at a time said you bunch of Holy Rollers down there don't jump out and roll up your sleeves now but talk with Godly love Temperance kindness I'm just going to fight him I'm just going to show him who boss yeah that don't sound like the Holy Ghost talking in you is that the way you want to be he said when you're rifled upon R rled upon rile not bad let him be your example when they said if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread he could have done it and showed he was God but he had Temperance self-control when they called him be he said I'll forgive you that right they pull handfuls of his beard out of his face and spit in his oh he must had a beard interesting we get so condemned sometime for having one they pulled handfuls out of his fa and spit in his face and said come down off the cross he said father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing I'm just reading you right from the prophet's message paragraph 227 few more now if you got it like that add it to your faith if you still blow up and Sass and fuss and stew and carry on uhhuh you ain't got no I'm glad he didn't finish it because we all know what he's talking about you ain't got no you can't add that because it won't add see it won't vulcanize now he's on to steal you couldn't take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron you just just won't work no it's got to be flexible just like the rubber is see and when your faith and your Temperance becomes the same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance that he had then it will vulcanize with him it will come into Union with him you're added to it when your virtue is like his virtue then it'll add to it isn't that simple when your knowledge is like his knowledge I come to do thy will oh god with the father's word he defeated every devil Heaven and Earth will pass away but the word will not see when you got that kind of knowledge it'll vulcanize with your faith you won't struggle to add it when you got the right kind of temperance like he had it'll vulcanize if you having just a man-made halfway s up belief or Temperance oh I ought to slap him down but maybe I better not because they might put my name in the paper about it that ain't the kind of temperance he's talking about don't try to add that it won't work but when you can really with the sweetness from your heart forgive every man hold your peace let it be gone then it'll vulcanize you can add that to your faith phw you still here you believe he was on the track there I do too what what paragraph Was that we stopped off with oh we not done yet 3:51 and now we've put the blood of Jesus Christ in see and that brings the faith of Jesus Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ the brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ and the love of God which is Jesus Christ he's the head and controls you and your feet is the foundation Faith amen controlled by the head you are there is the perfect man of God when he possesses these virtues remember what he went on to say if these be in you and abound you won't be unfruitful you will not be paragraph 312 we're going to go back just a minute in the sermon then sixthly the Bible said here adding Brotherly Love brotherly kindness now that word in the Greek is fraternal affection fraternal that's where they get the word Fraternity in college now today when we think about a fraternity we're not thinking about smart Godly young men always doing the right thing we thinking about a bunch of nutcases Gone Wild whipping each other with wet towels and drinking theel silly going to school on Monday with a headache and black eyes and but but that's not what it means scripturally a fraternity is a Brotherhood that can't be broken no matter what comes our way we are fighting for one another in the trenches of life we are uh a team we are vulcanized together to use brother brandom's expression there we're not leaving anybody behind we're bringing them all with us we we pledge to one another faithfulness in this fraternal affection brotherly kindness when we get to that brotherly kindness put yourself in his place on the matter that will help you that helps me I have to remind myself what would I do what if I were in that position what if I was going through that myself what if I'd been through that no wonder the Bible tells us and when you men Golden Rule people laugh at you Christian people even sometime laugh at you when you mention to them that the Golden Rule do unto others as you would have them not as they would treat you your kids go to the oh ungodly Egyptian public schools out there and then they come home and they've got this mentality well he did it to me first he said it to me first he treated me that way first first that that's not what it says it didn't say how you're treated is how you respond it said do unto others as you would like to be treated he were mean to me I guess he was you went after him like a barracuda 3:13 my brother sinned against me said Peter shall I forgive him Jesus said oh yes you're going to have to forgive him seven times a day Lord you know I can't forgive somebody seven times in one day that's a good thing because that's not the requirement it's 70 times seven if I didn't want you to stay off your phone while I'm preaching I'd tell you to pull out that big smartphone of yours and let you figure up because I know most of you couldn't probably do it in your head anymore thank you Nathan 490 times in a day I've got to forgive somebody I'm moving aren't you moving I'm just leaving if if I got somebody in my life that I have to forgive 490 times they ain't in my life a day wh what what if it's your child what what if he your spouse what if he your preacher some of us are stuck with each other so we're going to have to learn what Jesus was trying to teach us even if you should have to forgive 490 times a day this is what we do because we're new create new Creations new creatures in Christ amen brotherly kindness now you see if a brother is All Out Of [Music] Tune don't be impatient with him see no see be kind to him go anyhow I'm not liking this sermon very much are you somebody said not long ago how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the Assemblies of God and the Oneness is Oneness all the rest and but see brotherly kindness see boy I wish we could get some of that around this message hoping someday patient with him see temperate enduring with him knowledge to understand what he believes what it wouldn't hurt you sometime to know before you call somebody serpent seed it wouldn't hurt you to know a little bit about where they are because let me tell you something the mentality that we have had adopted around this message if you present it to them one time and they don't throw their whole life down and embrace it and put the pictures up then it ain't in them is wrong that's not even kind that's not even like Christ and if that's your understanding of this message you're you're just as much in a denomination as those folks out there did I just say that because we hear and receive from where we are and brother I've had people flat turn it down don't want to hear another word until they got in a in a bind and they started needing prayer and and they call for prayer and you just gently say I have to a few people that I knew very well just gently I've said well you know if I'm in a cult and I'm just following the dead man and don't even know who Jesus is I believe that is what you said is it why would you ask me for prayer it's like all the way back to high school when those guys would roll around me on the field Holy Roller Holy Roller and I'd just look at him and say look I'd rather roll into heaven than strut into hell and keep living my life and then behind the locker way off to the corner captain of the football team said Steve my parents are messed up marriage ruined they're going to get a div would you pray going on down the hall and one catch me along the way and say my my grandmother's in the hospital see if you reckon you could go by and pray for her on your way home from school today well sure I would same thing same thing now you saywell if I'm if I'm so wrong why in the world would you want prayer and and you'd be amazed sometime what they say well you've been consistent I've seen you just keep living the same life and there must be something to it well sure I'll pray for you no matter what you think about me I'll pray for you look what an opportunity it might give us to share the faith that God has sown into our lives please don't put people out as quickly as your mind tells you you want to show them a little Mercy show them a little Grace let's believe for isav God anointed your eyes to see the word he can anoint somebody else's eye well how do you know that the whole uh seed ever seed of God hadn't come in here's how I know I'm still here when that last seed of God has come in don't be impatient with him somebody said let's let's go on uh he said knowledge to understand what he believes come musicians remember it's in his heart that's what it is virtue in yourself to let it go out with kindness meekness to him having faith that someday God will bring him in oh Lord I have some folks I want to see you bring in I don't care if they ever call the name William brandom or not I just want them to know you in the fullest Capac ity that they can know you in if they learn to appreciate what I appreciate and receive Revelation that I that I'm going to dance a double jig but I have had to come to the reality that everybody can't see what you see and that doesn't mean they're unsavable or unlovable whosoever calth upon the name of the Lord they're not Overcomers the bride only the bride's going to overcome 3:16 brotherly kindness the seven thing one 2 3 4 five brother Ram tapped chalkboard don't need to know that see seven thing then now you're coming next thing then add charity which is love that's the capping Stone one of these days maybe you're thinking this morning as we close I could never get to that place oh yes oh yes yes you can and here's how one more quote just one more I've been planning this perfect strength by Perfect weakness number 54 perfect strength by Perfect weakness when we are insufficient ourselves then we are subjects to yield to God's spirit come on you with me as long as we think that we can do it we can't do it but when we get to a place where we know we can't do it then we yield oursel to God and guess what he does it through us that's his plan so then if it's us trying to do it it will fail but if we'll just yield ourselves to God then God can't fa fail there's only one thing that God cannot do and that's fail he cannot do anything else excuse me he can do anything else but fail but he cannot fail so as long as we're trying in ourselves and depending on our own abilities and so forth well we'll do nothing we'll foam and spit and sputter and temper and whatever El but when we get to a place where we know we're nothing oh Jesus oh Jesus folks this is opposite of the denominational Church message the denominational Church message is you're you can do anything you can do anything yeah oh yeah you can be president you can do anything that's not reality everybody everybody is not going to make it to that kind of a position doesn't mean you're not smart it's the same uh uh humanism that says everybody that runs a have a prize that's not what the scripture said the one that endures to the end and passes the line he's the one that gets the prize but today we don't want to hurt no child's feelings so everybody gets a ribbon and and you know good participation or something they call it oh my goodness setting our children up for a lifetime of disappointment and failure because somebody's going to do it while they're over there rejoicing that they participated somebody's going to pass them say same way same way they're just pumping people up with self-esteem I hear the message all the time it's a Joel osin gospel that doesn't mean that he doesn't say amazing things that you can apply to your life but everybody can't apply that kind of mentality and it's so opposite of what we've been taught really in the message because the message tells us from the word by the way that if we empty ourselves and recognize I can't do anything without him the bride she's not dumb she's not lazy she's not stupid we're not ignorant backwood folk that don't know how to get in or get out like they say but we have learned I pray we have if we haven't we got to learn it quickly that we're nothing without him without the bridegroom the bride is like a Wallflower but with him she becomes a beautiful queen we must have him we've got to have him I just wish that sometimes they would add that to a little little add of that just a touch of that to the gospel that they preach without Jesus just flat out get up there in front of hundreds of thousands of people and say without Jesus you are a flunky nobody buy that book can you imagine how many copies of that book could sell in the self-help section but it's a reality without Jesus we were not made to succeed without Jesus we were created to only Excel connected to him but as long as we're trying in ourselves let's go ping down but when we get to a place where we know we're nothing God can use us the important thing one of the uh one of the important things that we must Master especially you young preachers and lay members alike there's one thing that we've got to master if we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life that is we have to master our thought of human ability if we NE if we ever get to a spot where we think we can do it with our own intelligence and out of our own abilities we've got to master that in such a way we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside so that God can use us two more paragraphs and make a complete surrender and make a complete surrender and make a complete surrender we cannot use one ability we've got to make a complete surrender and to come to God you've got to surrender to him both soul body and spirit everything that you are has to be surrendered everything that you are has to be surrendered to God in order that he can work his will in you and me now that's hard I know because we're always wanting to put our part in something that we know we know we want to do it we say well I just know it should be done this way but as long as you're doing it that way it's going to be wrong and God will never use that effort maybe with the help of the Lord we're going to get uh into that in a few minutes and just show you how God cannot use your ability that is the truth let's stand together thank you for your patience I used almost every one of them minutes and bunch bunch of extra ones we used to sing a little course around here if you can use anything you can use me you think you can remember that so that you can teach it to me if you can use How does it go you can use me yeah
