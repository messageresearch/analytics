in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming to you again today in partnership with our good friends at the gospel channel today's broadcast is part 6 in a series in the fullness of time and we have been studying together how that God the great architect has a blueprint for instance we studied together how that God came down condescended and was born of a virgin girl fulfilling the prophets prophecies and changing lives forever the Word of God made flesh again and I hope you've enjoyed the study we have had some good response and especially on part 4 where we talked about the Incarnation we talked about this messianic prophecy that was spoken in the book of Genesis chapter 3 and we just pray that the truth that we study together will be a blessing and an inspiration in your life if you miss an

we said before a lot of these things are available in other places on the internet however it's a wonderful thing to be able to bring them together in one convenient location that you can access it with your iPad your smartphone tablet whatever whatever it is that you use and we also have the songs of sister Janice green brother Perry greens wife she is in her early 80s now still singing for the Lord these are some of her earlier recordings and they are very anointed and I know that you will be blessed and just a few weeks ago my wife and my children and I had the privilege of spending a couple weeks with sister green we tried to do that every year in the warm City of Tucson Arizona and it was a real blessing for me to be able to download the new hope revival ministries app on sister greens iPad and show her some of the material that's available there so go and look for that will you I want us to go back today to the foundation of this series although we read it just the last time we were together and the time before but I just want you to get the theme and I'll try to do it quickly so that we can move on to the portion of material that we have set aside for the broadcast today but we were studying from Galatians chapter 4 the first seven verses now I say that the air as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the Father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of Suns that is really good news and because she our sons God had sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father or Papa wherefore thou art no more a servant but a man a son but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ wherefore thou art no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of God through Christ I believe every word of that portion of Scripture Paul writing to the church in Galatia when we have studied in the other portions part one through five of this series in the fullness of times we talked about the way that God made we talked about how that he introduced his plan how that he chose Joseph and Mary and those who would play a very important role in playing out or fulfilling the plan that God had on his mind from before the foundation of the world we talked about the the Messianic prophecy given there in the third chapter of the book of Genesis we talked about the the seed of the woman and how God did something new something that had never been done in the earth before how he visited the womb of Mary how he placed in her this very special creation something that he had created specifically of took to bring forth God in in a body of flesh we're going to move forward now in in our study together we're going to share some more scriptures that talk about exactly what took place in that little manger in Bethlehem it was more than a the birth a good man much more than the birth of a prophet even more than the birth of a savior but it was indeed God condescending coming down choosing to live in a body of flesh in 2nd Timothy chapter 1 verses 9 and 10 he it says who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace see his own purpose his own blueprint his own plan which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began now I better read that together without interrupting it who had saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ who hath abolished death and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel so here is another portion of Scripture revealing to us that God had a plan and in the fullness of time he actuated that plan he activated and fulfilled the greatest portion of that plan it was determined before the world began but verse 10 tells us but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ one of my favorite portions of Scripture in the Gospels John chapter one verses one through three in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God that's such an important verse the word was not only with God it was but it was God God and the word were one and the same what a beautiful picture we can get with the eyes of the Spirit the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and they're beautiful verses that go on to reveal this plan in John chapter 1 but look at verse 14 with me again because this is that in the fullness of time moment and the word we already learned the Word was with God and the Word was God it was the same from the beginning and now we learned that the word was made flesh the word the logos of God was made into flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth what a revelation to know that Jesus was the Word of God Jesus was God made flesh the Word of God put on flesh in the body of our Lord Jesus Christ and this was God's plan from before the beginning from before the foundation of the world and then in Luke chapter 2 we read what this looked like in verses 3 through 7 and all went to be taxed and everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea into the city David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son not just her firstborn son but she was bringing forth the Word made flesh she was bearing God made flesh what a beautiful plan she brought forth her firstborn son wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger they tell me that those swaddling clothes were not beautiful baby blue warm blankets like a baby might receive in a modern-day hospital but rather most likely the oily rags that were used to wipe down the sweaty animals when they would come in out of the field into the stable for rest and they would be rat wiped down with these oily rags - to help keep their body temperature right can you imagine what those sweaty rags may have smelt like but it was what was available the king of all kings not born in the nursery of a palace but in a in a stable in a barn some say in a Sukkah a temporary dwelling place where the animals were gathered and God made flesh the Word made flesh laid in a little stone manger a trough where the animals would come in and find their grain find their food and some believe that it was also a shelf that was used in the sukkah for the laying of bread where bread was laid either way what a place for the king of kings to be born what clothes swaddling clothes to be wrapped in but it doesn't matter so much the circumstances of his birth but who he was is what matters the circumstances are important because each and every detail as I will show you in a future study each and every detail of his prophesied coming was fulfilled to the letter that's the goodness of God to you and I look at Philippians chapter 2 with me verses 6 through 11 who being in the form of God this is describing our Lord Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God please understand he has no less God than what you understand of the father he was the same God he is the same God and of the same essence the body of our Lord as son the Word made flesh as the Son of God but no less God than the eternal spirit of the father when the father decided that he would come to this earth he came in a fleshly body jesus said when you have seen me you have seen the father because in his body was contained that spirit of the father the same essence of God who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross verse 9 wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and giving him a name I think that it is so profound I know that there are many who who teach an eternal sonship but if there were an eternal sonship what would be his name because his name was not eternal he did not always have that name the scripture says and the father hath highly exalted him God hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus we sometimes say Yeshua his Hebrew name every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father to recognize that Jesus is God to recognize that he is equal to God and that he is the word of God made flesh it's not to take anything away from the beauty of the office of the father in fact it is to recognize the expression of the father in a body of flesh remember the last verse says and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God and Father so this is this is a glory to the father when we recognize who Jesus is it's a glory to the Father and and the same the same reference in John 1:14 that we just read when we when we look at him when we look at Jesus we behold the glory as we behold his glory the glory of the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth so don't get bogged down in the semantics of theology so that you so completely divide God into three pieces that you are not able to see how in spirit he is one many have made that mistake and it originated from the idea of trying to settle the people down who were coming out of pagan religions into Christianity and into what is known as a monotheistic a one God faith and many of the pagans from the Roman system and from the other Isles all these pagans coming in to accept Christ as Savior they were having a hard time making that mental shift because they were used to worshipping many many gods and now they've had to come and say wait a minute there is one God here o Israel the Lord thy God is one and they were making making some it was making it difficult and so many of the religious leaders in their efforts to try to describe it have actually taken away the beauty of the oneness of God and his love his great love for us and what I often say is when when I hear people emphasizing God is three I say oh he's he's much more than that he's much more there there is so much more in him than that he is healer and Savior and deliverer and counselor he's wonderful the mighty God the everlasting father lily-of-the-valley goes on and on and on but all of these are one because it is the same spirit the one and only spirit the eternal spirit of the Father look at Galatians chapter 4 the verse that we just read a moment ago here we are again in verse 4 but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons this is why God chose to do it way he did he did it to reveal sonship he did it to model sonship the the the love of the Father for the son the relationship of the son to the Father and because of that he has sent the spirit of his son into our hearts by the new birth so that we can cry my father Abba Father Papa God we are not the only begotten Son of God this is the body of our Lord Jesus Christ but we are also the sons of God for John one st. chapter tells us as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God this happens by spiritual adoption we are given the authority of sons because of the work of the new birth on the inside of us every bit of this a part of God's plan he didn't just choose Bethlehem and choose Mary and choose the shepherds and decide who would be the king and who would be the Roman governor at the time all that was definitely a part of what had to be determined in the blueprint of God but he was thinking much deeper than the players on the stage he was also planning and thinking the effect the personal intimate effect that this Jesus the Word made flesh would have in our individual lives when he sent us that same spirit that was in the son that we could feel our connection and cry Abba Father I know we've talked about it before being in the shook in Jerusalem on the day before Shabbat and all the little children coming with their dads because most cases mom is at home preparing the home and the meal for for the Shabbat that will come in at sundown that evening so you see dad's with many many children sometime and in the crowd they can get separated and you'll hear these sweet little tender voices Abba ABBA it doesn't matter how many voices are crying Abba that father knows the voice of his child that child recognizes the voice of his father and this is what the scripture is telling us it's by that spirit of adoption it's by the same spirit that was on the son he sent forth that spirit into our lives that we might understand the grace the spirit of adoption whereby we can also say oh my papa my Abba my father oh this is it gets me every time I talk about it I mean I love to talk about the star and the wise men and and all the different aspects but all when we start talking about the the the huge transforming effect that this has on my life as an individual it was all about getting you and I into that intimate place of relationship with eternal God God loved you that much that he would go to all this planning to all this trouble indeed to all this suffering that he might make it possible for you to be one with him in the spirit Wow Oh how He loves us and in order to do that he had to think of everything God the Eternal Spirit of the Father had to plan at all he had to think about how that seed would be protected in Luke chapter 3 and verse 38 you'll you'll you'll get a glimpse as you read some of those early chapters of the Gospels you'll get a glimpse of the lineage of our Lord and in verse 38 of Luke 3 it says we was the son of eNOS which was the son of Seth which was the son of Adam which was the son of God that's one of my favorite verses in in the listing of all those lineages of who began who and who and and etc you come up to Adam and and and and who was before Adam only God God was his father and this was a lineage that had to be protected all the way down because even though the man Joseph would not have a physical contribution Mary would receive this gift into her womb and so the seed had to be protected even all the way through to Mary from the lineage of David all the way down because God chose Joseph even though he was an adopted father he cared for the Lord and raised the boy Jesus and loved him as his own but physically had no contribution because Mary was overshadowed by the Holy Spirit and received this seed of a woman that was so different than any other conception because here is an egg that has already been infused with the very seed of God the very chosen gene life of God what a plan on a plan this is greater than medical doctors science can explain all of this because this was supernatural the holy spirit overshadowed her and prepared her physical body to receive this gift since it was the woman Eve in the garden who was deceived it was chosen that way and it would be a woman through whom the Savior would come remember the seed of a woman it was chosen that way and not the seed of a man and so what happened in the Arden played a very important role a very important aspect of the birth of our Lord and the way he came and that he came through a woman it goes all the way back to the beginning to the Garden of Eden first Timothy chapter 2 verses 13 14 and 15 read for Adam was first formed then Eve remember it was from Adam God reached inside of Adam and took out this portion that became Eve verse 14 and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression I have seen some angry people when you point out that verse of scripture to them I've heard them say some awful angry things what do you mean Adam was not deceived that's exactly right that's what the scripture said Adam knew exactly the Bible said that she did eat and gave to Adam and he did eat also so whatever it is that Eve partook in Adam partook of the very same thing and yet the Bible said Eve was deceived and Adam was not deceived what does that mean it means that Adam knew exactly what he was doing because his life as a son of God and his ministry as the first created son of god was about to unfold adam's ministry was that even though he was not deceived he partook he became guilty by partaking of the same thing he did not do it through deception deception means fooled into doing something beguiled into doing something you're not even really aware of all the consequences Eve opened up her life to reason and she believed what the enemy was telling her perhaps she thought that what she was doing would even be a blessing to her husband that this would in fact be something that would help him in the future that he would receive because remember the Satan through the serpent said why God knows that in the very minute that you do that your eyes are going to be opened you'll be just like God let me tell you something Adam was already just like God he was created in the image and in the likeness of God and from that image Eve was taken so so Satan was trying to sell something that was already theirs and by introducing the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil I'm telling you this this opened the door for thought patterns that have literally attacked nearly to the point of destruction mankind all down through the ages Adam in that original creation had no real understanding of good and evil it was all good that's all he had for a concept was that which God had created as good once you add in the knowledge that there is also evil you'd think that that would be enough to keep man only on that which is good but instead it opened a temptation that forbidden fruit mentality that has plagued a man ever since but God knew this none of this took God by surprise he had Adam though he was not deceived he knew that Adam would step in that he would also partake and in doing so he would become a very important covering for the sin of Eve now when God comes down in the cool of the day Adam is standing there a representation of his own bride of his own wife also guilty but not by deception the scripture goes on to say that notwithstanding even though the woman being deceived was in the transgression notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness and sobriety this right here that shows us that from the Garden of Eden there was a prophecy going forth of how the answer to the sin problem was going to come and how the answer to the deception problem was going to come it was going to come through childbearing not just the childbearing of godly women but the childbearing of a godly woman Mary who was going to give herself be it unto me according to thy word and in the bearing of this special gift child who had remember blood not the blood of Mary not the blood of Joseph but the blood of God God's created blood for redemption but yet to get this blood to the earth so that it could be shed so that it could cover the sins of mankind childbearing childbirth was a very important part of this process this word childbearing is only used one time from the Greek in the entire New Testament and it means a specific one it's not just talking about childbearing in general but it's a Greek word that speaks about one specific child that has been born it's interesting to know that because because this one special child was born it makes redemption available to every godly woman if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety and also to every man what a beautiful way to look at this scripture in in the texts when we look at this verse it actually would read through her childbearing referring back to Eve as a type or a symbol of another woman another one who would come and bring forth from her loin Eve brought forth from her body the knowledge of good and evil two seeds were represented in that birth twins but in the birth that her childbearing pointed to Mary there was only one seed brought forth the very seed of God oh my I love the scripture I really do and first Corinthians 15 helps us to see this I hope I've not bogged you down 1st Corinthians chapter 15 verses 45 through 47 and so it is written I pray when we are in a program like the one today where we have lots of scriptures I hope you get your Bible I hope you'll get your Bible out and read them in your own Bible for yourself mark them down if you can't go to youtube and watch the episode again if you're really interested in these scriptures and taking a little more extra time to study them or go to the app find the program and get your Bible on one knee and your your your smartphone on the other knee or whatever and mark these down in your Bible because this is your story these scriptures not only tell about God's gift to mankind but they are telling the story of God's gift to you as an individual as a part of corporate mankind this is my story what happened in the garden is part of my story what happened in Bethlehem is part of my story what happened on a hill right outside of Jerusalem is my story hallelujah what happened on the day of Pinnacle Point it's my story because I'm connected to this truth I'm a Parchin to bear it to live it to be an example of it first Corinthians 15:45 and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul pause a moment remember here is this body created from the dust but it was not until God came and breathed breath into the nostrils of Adam who think about this the Eternal Spirit of God came into the garden nose to nose mouth to mouth with Adam and breathed into him the ruach ha'qodesh the very the very breath of the spirit the very breath of eternal God and when that breath was entering into Adam the spirit breath entering into Adam the body of flesh the connection between the body of flesh and the Eternal Spirit of God there had to be something to to connect the two there had to be a bridge and the bridge between body and spirit was soul and man became a living soul and in that soul is the mind and the will and the emotions so look at this verse in light of that truth the first man Adam was made a living soul and I just explained how that was the last Adam who is that last Adam the Lord Jesus Christ in the same way that Adam knew no deception and yet he willfully took on this sin joined himself with this sin he was guilty there's nothing here that says Adam wasn't guilty it says he wasn't deceived meaning he knew what he was doing he was guilty of that sin but he knew that he was and he was doing it for a purpose a beautiful purpose it was a sermon it was a symbol and a type that preaches to us about the coming of the last Adam the first man Adam was made a living soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit a resurrection spirit verse 46 howbeit that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural Adam and afterward that which is spiritual we had to see Adam the first Adam becoming a living soul which connected him in the natural he was of the natural and we see by resurrection our Lord becoming a quickening spirit a resurrecting spirit which is not of the natural but it is a spiritual event and listen remember what the scripture said if that same spirit quickening spirit resurrection life spirit if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you it shall also make alive it shall also quicken revive resurrect your mortal body so what a promise we have for the future even if we leave this earth by the way of death there is a resurrection spirit life that will resurrect and revive and quick and even the mortal body I also believe that this is a spiritual Scripture that is not only referring to a future physical rebel resurrection not only referring to a future physical resurrection but it also describes that spiritual quickening that takes place when the Word of God finds that resting place in us and the spirit of Revelation anoints that word and it becomes quickening resurrection life on the inside I've been sitting where the Word of God was going forth and felt like there was a man coming out of the tomb me so much alive I can't say that it happens every time I sit under preaching but I have sat under preaching at times when the word was really going forth where I really felt like a dead man was coming alive in me that is a very important experience because it gives you something to hold on to when there are no feelings because there are times when we live this thing entirely by faith not at all by sight not at all by feeling we just have to take God at His Word and remember the times that we have seen in the times that we have heard the times that we have felt now watch verse 47 the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from heaven I want you to know this is New Testament understanding of what took place all those years before showing us that God knew exactly what he was doing the last Adam restored what mankind lost in the first Adam we needed the last Adam one who also was not deceived he wasn't fooled into the trial fooled into this into the crucifixion he knew exactly what he was doing he was made sin though he personally knew no sin though he personally committed no sin he was made he was transformed into sin so that he might stand before God on my behalf like Adam was willing to stand before God on Eve's behalf can you see that can you see that the Bride of Christ is really her type is of of the eve of the earthly eve of the first Eve that what Eve how he failed in the way that Eve failed by receiving this lie of the enemy she received a seed of discrepancy she reasoned the Word of God away listening to a lie believing a lie acting upon a lie there was another woman that we have identified as Mary or Miriam who received a seed by saying be it unto me according to thy word she didn't receive it in deception she didn't receive it in sin she didn't receive it even in a sexual act she received that seed in a supernatural overshadowing which is a type of exactly what was going on in the garden it pointed to it and now today there's a bride Church being raised up to serve the Lord and we have a choice you have a choice which woman of God will you will you carry on which woman of God will you be identified with Eve who reasoned the Word of God away and created quite a mess or will you as a bride of Christ identify yourself with a Miriam with a Mary who said oh it's going to be reproach it's going to be misunderstood it's not going to be easy there's going to be accusation but be it unto me according to thy word yes friend there is a little bride around the world that God is working in and dealing with and speaking to getting us ready because there is a work yet to be done and there is a character an attribute that must be manifested in this last day the resurrection life of Jesus Christ so the last Adam restored to mankind what was lost in the first Adam this is called reconciliation to restore to the original position before the fall and even beyond look at another verse of scripture in the time that we have left look at Ephesians chapter 1 verses 9 through 12 here's another another gospel message here's another letter another epistle talking about this great mystery unfolding in the fullness of the time having made known unto us verse 9 the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ this is what it was about this is what the garden was about this is what the the Tabernacle the temple was about this is what the backsliding of Israel was about and the prophets of restoration were about this is what the Gospels were about the life of Jesus Christ the crucifixion the death the resurrection this is what the day of Pentecost was about this is what the glorious revelation that flowed to us through the New Testament was about this is what all of the seven church ages were about it was about these verses that in the fullness of times when all of these things had happened when everything had been pointing pointing pointing pointing to Christ from the Garden of Eden to the cross everything was pointing to Christ and the work of redemption that he would accomplish at the cross from that moment on everything is not just pointing to Christ but it's pointing to a bride to two sons who receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father it speaks now it's pointing now to a corporate man a many membered body the body of Christ has one head but we are many members the scripture said it's talking about and pointing to an overcoming people to him that overcometh will I grant these gifts will I grant these things these blessings I'm telling you there are going to be there is a people who will raise up in this hour overcoming the spirit of the age how will they do it because they're smart because they're good-looking because they go to the right church no no no no no because they're chosen because they have been identified with Christ since before the foundation of the world let me go back and read instead of interrupting the scripture having made known unto us the mystery of his will here it is how do we know the mystery oops I'm interrupting how do we know the mystery of his will by looking at Jesus and his ministry by reading the New Testament because no one had a revelation of Jesus Christ in the Bible like the Apostle Paul read those those scriptures some of which I've shared with you that's how the mystery of his will has been revealed and made manifest having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ and if you say wait a minute I'm not a thing well listen how it qualifies this both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him we're a part of that we're a part of the gathering together of all things in Christ things which are in heaven things which are in the earth but even in him all in him verse 11 in whom also we have obtained an inheritance what what did we do to deserve an inheritance how is it that we get an inheritance who invited us to the reading of the will listen this didn't just happen the night you walked down the aisle and gave your heart to the Lord at an old revival meeting Oh No in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ what a message if you can only see if I can only see what this scripture is revealing to us we receive an inheritance we are made partakers of Christ because we are a part of his predestinated plan for planet Earth we have been chosen in him since before the foundation of the world we've read those scriptures to you before remember that biblical predestination is foreknowledge so don't let that trip you up God knew your choice this is never to say you didn't have a choice it's freewill free moral agency I'm I know that that's biblical enough I've got to stand by that but this predestination is a foreknowledge according to the New Testament it's a foreknowledge II it's God knowing before before it happened before you ask before you were born before you went to the altar in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of Oh you Lord that you have predestinated me according to your purpose thank you O Lord that I have an inheritance thank you that you called me to the reading of the will and I've become the beneficiary of the resurrection life of Jesus Christ I stand justified not because I'm worthy not because I deserve it but because it's my inheritance justification is our inheritance sanctification is our inheritance to be filled with the Holy Ghost is our inheritance it's not because of our works you get filled with the Holy Ghost and you're going to live a better life you're going to you're going to do better works you're going to behave better than you behaved before no doubt about it but none of those things in themselves qualify us for this inheritance it was his foreknowledge of us it was his his choice he chose us by what he saw he knew our choice and he chose us I tell you were chosen many many many have this understanding and revelation we're chosen and I pray that if this is for you you will also have a salve applied to your eyes and you will be able to see that everything that has happened in your life was to bring you to this moment where you could be gathered together in in as one in Christ all of it every Bible story everything in church age history what a beautiful plan and it took in the fullness of times it took those moments where everything was lined up just right we'll look at it more when we meet again father I thank you today for this beautiful story my story our story your

with the same life the same spirit that was inside of you all of that to bring us to this hour where as part of our inheritance we are gathered together as one in you Lord I pray for revelation to strengthen the children of God who will see this program I pray for healing for the sick and the infirm I pray that backsliders will be stirred to call on you I pray for those who have been burned and
