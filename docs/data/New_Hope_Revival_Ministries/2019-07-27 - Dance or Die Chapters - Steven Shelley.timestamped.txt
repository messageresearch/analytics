[0:16] in the early 1990s I was invited to
[0:20] preach at a youth convocation in Metro
[0:25] Manila in the Philippines thousands of
[0:28] young people Pentecostal young people
[0:30] had come together for a very special
[0:33] time of seeking the Lord and I was there
[0:37] to minister in several churches
[0:39] throughout the islands but as a part of
[0:42] the itinerary I was invited to go and
[0:45] even though I'm a non-denominational
[0:48] preacher I was invited by this
[0:51] Pentecostal group to come and my what a
[0:54] wonderful time we had it was in that
[0:57] service that I heard a song for the
[1:00] first time that I've enjoyed singing
[1:02] many many times since then as those
[1:05] young people lifted their hands and
[1:08] tilted their heads back and entered into
[1:10] the presence of the Lord they began to
[1:12] sing a little chorus and the words are
[1:15] like this when the Spirit of the Lord
[1:18] falls upon my heart I will dance like
[1:23] David danced and danced we did in the
[1:28] presence of the Lord and I also remember
[1:30] when that service was over the floor was
[1:33] slanted toward the stage and I watched
[1:37] as those precious young people wept to
[1:39] their way to a closer walk with God and
[1:43] I saw the tears as they come flowing
[1:45] down that floor mingling together and by
[1:48] the time they got to the bottom of the
[1:50] stage they had formed what looked like a
[1:53] stream of Tears it moved me and I've
[1:57] never forgotten it inspired me in a
[2:00] tremendous way I want to share with you
[2:03] the verses of Scripture where that
[2:05] phrase is taken from when David truly
[2:09] danced before the Lord in 2nd Samuel
[2:12] chapter 6 verses 13 through 16 it says
[2:16] and it was so that when they that bear
[2:18] the Ark of the Lord had gone six phases
[2:20] he sacrificed oxen and fat
[2:23] and David danced before the Lord with
[2:27] all his might and David was girded with
[2:30] a linen ephod so David and all the house
[2:33] of Israel brought up the Ark of the Lord
[2:35] with shouting and with the sound of the
[2:38] trumpet and as the Ark of the Lord came
[2:41] into the City of David Michael or Mahale
[2:44] Saul's daughter looked through a window
[2:47] and saw King David leaping and dancing
[2:51] before the Lord and she despised him in
[2:55] her heart I think most of you are
[2:58] familiar with the story and you know of
[3:01] the fatal decision that David had made
[3:03] earlier to bring the Ark of the Covenant
[3:06] the Ark of the Lord into the City of
[3:08] David the city of Jerusalem and he
[3:11] thought well we ought to give it a more
[3:14] up-to-date mode of transportation than
[3:19] men being carried as it has been carried
[3:22] all of these years but David was
[3:24] forgetting that God had a provided order
[3:27] and he had a provided protocol and so
[3:30] they built a new cart and as they were
[3:33] bringing the ark forward on that new
[3:35] cart pulled by oxen it began to shake
[3:39] and there was a man by the name of OSA
[3:41] who stretched forth his hand to steady
[3:44] the ark and was slain in the presence of
[3:46] God David felt very responsible for what
[3:50] had taken place and the Ark of the Lord
[3:53] eventually made it to the house of
[3:55] obed-edom and I believe that David
[3:57] according to this verses of Scripture
[3:59] that in this chapter and one other place
[4:02] I believe that David was waiting it out
[4:06] he wanted to make sure that the the
[4:09] anger of the Lord was no longer kindled
[4:12] against him and that everything was in
[4:15] order to move forward he began to hear
[4:19] that the blessings of God were falling
[4:22] on the house of obed-edom because of the
[4:25] presence of the Lord that was with the
[4:27] Ark and he said I think now is the right
[4:30] time
[4:31] and so he arranged a great procession to
[4:35] bring the Ark of the Lord the house of
[4:38] obed-edom in a city Kiryat i-i'm just
[4:43] outside the city of jerusalem about a 14
[4:46] 15 mile journey david went all the way
[4:49] over there and he said we're going to
[4:52] stop every six phases and sacrifice both
[4:57] oxen and fat legs to the Lord I think
[5:01] this was over and above what was
[5:03] necessary but David was doing it because
[5:06] he wanted to get it right this time
[5:10] he learned from his mistake the Bible
[5:14] said that as they began to move forward
[5:16] that David went before the ark dancing
[5:20] with all of his might that word dancing
[5:23] that used here is from the Hebrew and it
[5:26] it's a particular word that means to
[5:28] spin around around and around like the
[5:31] turning of of a mill wheel the wheel of
[5:35] a mill and so it wasn't just a little
[5:39] kicking up of the of the feet it was a
[5:42] glorious dance it was an amazing dance
[5:47] around and around and around the Ark of
[5:50] the Covenant he went the Bible tells us
[5:54] here how David was dressed I think
[5:59] there's a real reason for that it tells
[6:01] us that he was dressed in a linen ephod
[6:05] that was the simple work garment of the
[6:10] priest those who were servants of
[6:13] Jehovah ministering before the Lord in
[6:18] the tabernacle and eventually in the
[6:21] temple it was alright for David to wear
[6:24] that ephod but it was most unusual for
[6:28] him to wear it in a public procession
[6:31] and in order to be seen in his linen
[6:35] ephod he would have had to
[6:37] remove his regal and festal robes those
[6:43] beautiful garments that differentiated
[6:46] and set him apart as the king of Israel
[6:50] it also means that he would have had to
[6:53] remove his heavy crown and so he didn't
[6:58] look like the king of Israel that day as
[7:00] he danced before the Lord he looked like
[7:03] a common servant or a common priest he
[7:07] was so moved and so inspired that the
[7:10] blessing of the Lord would now be upon
[7:14] the City of David the City of Jerusalem
[7:18] he was so delighted because this Ark of
[7:21] the Covenant represented the word of the
[7:24] Lord
[7:25] it was the earthly representation of the
[7:28] throne of God and David was so moved so
[7:32] excited that it was coming back to
[7:35] Jerusalem and that meant the blessing
[7:37] and the presence of God was coming back
[7:40] to Jerusalem that he just got beside
[7:43] himself he forgot about royal protocol
[7:47] he forgot about any pride that he might
[7:50] have previously had or ego and he laid
[7:54] all of that other stuff down and he
[7:58] worshiped the Lord in in a grand fashion
[8:02] I love that it's inspiring to me because
[8:08] when we come into the house of the Lord
[8:10] every week we also are weighted down
[8:14] with our troubles and our worries and
[8:17] our cares and if perchance we have dealt
[8:21] with all of that before we come
[8:24] sometimes we still have our pride we
[8:27] have our ego we have our reputation to
[8:31] maintain and so we want to make sure
[8:33] that we don't get too excited in the
[8:38] house of the Lord but I want you to know
[8:41] that if there's ever been a time
[8:43] to come into God's presence and worship
[8:46] Him with all of our might with all of
[8:49] our strength with all of our heart this
[8:51] is the hour to do that it creates an
[8:55] atmosphere for the Word of God to come
[8:58] with both power and demonstration the
[9:03] Bible tells us that hell the daughter of
[9:06] Saul had been given to David as a wife
[9:10] in fact taken from another man and given
[9:14] to David as a wife I don't think she was
[9:17] very happy to be where she was but the
[9:20] Bible said she was looking out the
[9:21] window and she saw David dancing most
[9:25] violently before the Lord and she
[9:27] despised him in her heart and accused
[9:31] him later of dancing before the women
[9:34] uncovering himself before the women she
[9:39] didn't think that this kind of display
[9:42] of emotion was fitting for someone of
[9:46] such stature and such importance but I
[9:50] want you to know David did not want to
[9:52] be viewed that day as the king of Israel
[9:55] he wanted to be seen as a servant of the
[9:58] Lord and he wanted all the focus all the
[10:02] adoration to go to the King of Kings and
[10:06] the Lord of lords when we get in a tough
[10:09] spot we need to praise the Lord there's
[10:13] only two times to praise him when we
[10:16] feel like it and when we don't feel like
[10:18] it if we will press in with a sacrifice
[10:22] of praise if we will lay aside all the
[10:26] other stuff that weighs on our mind that
[10:30] keeps us from enjoying the Liberty that
[10:32] we can have in the presence of the Lord
[10:34] if we'll put all that down and begin to
[10:37] give God everything we have clapping our
[10:39] hands raising our hands lifting our
[10:42] voices shouting before the Lord and yes
[10:45] even dancing the psalm tells us dance
[10:49] before the lord I know there's a proper
[10:52] time there's a proper place there's a
[10:55] proper order
[10:57] but I also know this Satan would like to
[10:59] steal your praise he will send somebody
[11:03] to criticize you he did David but David
[11:07] had an answer for her he certainly did
[11:10] in 2nd Samuel 6 21 and 22 he said I
[11:15] wasn't dancing before you and in one of
[11:19] the other translations of those verses
[11:22] it said I'm gonna become even more
[11:24] undignified than this I'll be humiliated
[11:29] in my own eyes but the slave girls that
[11:31] you spoke of I will be held in honor and
[11:33] that's exactly what what what would have
[11:35] happened David said I'm just gonna be
[11:38] vile or the next time I'm not going to
[11:41] let criticism stop me somebody is going
[11:44] to despise your praise somebody's going
[11:48] to misunderstand your dance somebody is
[11:51] gonna look at you like you're way too
[11:53] loud and you need to hold hold back you
[11:56] need to watch yourself a little bit but
[11:58] I want you to know there's a time to be
[12:01] quiet to be reserved to honor and
[12:06] cherish the sacred moment but there is
[12:09] also a time that we need to turn loose
[12:12] of some things lay aside some things and
[12:16] maybe your dance will not be a physical
[12:18] dance but maybe it will just be a
[12:21] determination that says I'm going to
[12:24] praise the Lord because he is worthy no
[12:27] matter what I'm going through dancing
[12:30] will cost you praise will cost you as I
[12:33] said it will be misunderstood I want to
[12:36] read a quick quote in closing it comes
[12:39] from the daughter of Billy Graham her
[12:42] name is Anne Graham Lotz many of you are
[12:47] familiar with her and you know that she
[12:49] is in a battle with cancer
[12:52] here is something she said a Christian
[12:56] will dance or Die you have no other
[12:58] choice dance before the king of kings or
[13:02] sit on the pew and be critical
[13:05] and die you can't even watch others
[13:09] dance and get by you've got to do it or
[13:12] die I believe those are appropriate
[13:14] words I believe sometime the only way
[13:19] out is to praise your way out and I want
[13:24] to encourage you you don't have to wait
[13:26] till you get to church maybe you're in a
[13:28] environment a church environment that
[13:30] doesn't allow much demonstration of
[13:33] praise get in your living room get out
[13:37] in the barn get out behind the house go
[13:41] out in the woods go wherever you can go
[13:44] and sing your praise dance before the
[13:48] Lord with all of your strength and with
[13:50] all of your mind because he alone is
[13:52] worthy and tell the enemy you'll not
[13:56] steal my praise you'll not quench my
[14:00] dance I'm going to make sure that the
[14:03] glory and the honor belongs to the Lord
[14:06] and that he receives it no matter what
[14:09] I'm going through
[14:11] god bless you it's dance or die
