[42:43] that you're pressing your way into the
[42:45] presence of the lord that you're not
[42:47] holding back
[42:48] if you are holding back we invite you to
[42:52] press into whatever god has for you
[42:54] today
[42:55] because i believe that he has an
[42:57] appointment with every one of us
[42:59] and jesus doesn't miss any of his
[43:02] appointments
[43:03] i've missed a few that he called me to
[43:05] but he didn't miss them
[43:07] now i'm glad that he's here today to
[43:09] keep his appointment with us this
[43:12] is the first sunday of the month and
[43:13] today we're going to receive the tithe
[43:16] and the offering first
[43:17] and then we're going to receive our
[43:19] principal offering
[43:21] as we have been doing for the last
[43:23] couple of months
[43:24] we uh we are grateful for the goodness
[43:28] of the lord
[43:29] the amount that has been given thus far
[43:31] toward the principle
[43:33] is 101 693 dollars and 45
[43:38] cents that is above and beyond the
[43:42] payments that have been made
[43:51] we are so happy that now
[43:55] it is reversed and more of the payment
[43:58] now goes to the principle than to
[44:00] interest
[44:01] and god is faithful and we're looking
[44:04] for this debt to be complete by the
[44:06] grace of god
[44:08] now i am going to do something a little
[44:10] bit different today
[44:12] and you that have been watching the
[44:14] chosen get used to different
[44:18] all right so the first thing i'm going

[44:32] and your offering

[44:36] come and get the second offering bag
[44:38] i'm doing this for the sake of time but
[44:40] you have to listen to instruction
[44:43] as they come to you for the tithe and
[44:45] offering
[44:46] then i invite you as you have given your
[44:48] tithe and offering so we don't have mass
[44:50] confusion

[44:53] come and give your principal offering
[44:55] michael will be standing right up here
[44:57] for you to give your principal offering

[48:44] and we have a wonderful group of
[48:47] friends from indiana that have come to
[48:50] visit us
[48:51] and we became acquainted with some of
[48:54] these at the youth camp in indiana and
[48:56] then joyce and i were privileged to
[48:58] go to the farm of brother levi and
[49:01] sister
[49:02] elizabeth fisher and and get to
[49:06] know them better and we're so glad that
[49:09] sister elizabeth is here today god chose
[49:12] to take brother levi about a year and a
[49:15] half ago
[49:16] but god has given sister elizabeth grace
[49:19] and she is here with her daughter fanny
[49:22] and her son daniel her son john
[49:26] and her son-in-law john and her daughter
[49:30] sadie where's josiah is he there is he
[49:33] sleeping
[49:34] all right he's on the pew that is john
[49:37] and sadie's son
[49:39] josiah then uh you'll remember we had
[49:43] brother elam and sister
[49:45] mary fisher they were here at
[49:48] uh camp meeting time and this time they
[49:51] brought their son
[49:52] christian so we're glad that they're
[49:54] here with us today
[49:56] and then over here is another one of
[49:58] sister elizabeth's
[50:00] daughters annie her husband john
[50:03] see this makes it a little easier
[50:04] because we have john john and john
[50:07] and so that helps a little bit and they
[50:09] have
[50:10] two little boys stephen and
[50:13] daniel and we are did i get all of them
[50:16] 14 of you all right and we're going to
[50:18] invite them to come and sing this
[50:20] morning
[50:21] will you come we honor you and we thank
[50:24] god for you
[50:38] brother
[50:45] good morning everyone good morning it's
[50:47] so good to be here again
[50:49] and i just really enjoyed the worship
[50:52] and it's encouraging
[50:56] i was uh thinking
[51:00] here this morning about uh
[51:04] the scripture says that uh well peter
[51:07] said that we left all to follow you
[51:11] and jesus said if we
[51:15] leave fathers and mothers and houses and
[51:18] lands and sisters and brothers
[51:21] we'll receive it again in this life with
[51:24] persecutions
[51:26] and eternal life and we've experienced
[51:29] a lot of that when we
[51:33] saw the truth of a lot of what we saw
[51:36] bible truths and uh didn't really line
[51:39] up with the amish beliefs so
[51:41] they couldn't go along with it very well
[51:44] and eventually we saw that it just we
[51:47] just have to move on
[51:48] so it got to the point where we didn't
[51:50] really care anymore if they find out
[51:51] that we're having secret meetings and
[51:53] things like that
[51:54] so during the night and
[51:59] and we found that scripture very true we
[52:02] had to leave the land we were on we were
[52:04] living on my dad's farm
[52:06] and had to leave our houses and brothers
[52:09] and sisters and
[52:10] fathers and mothers but we found others
[52:14] that's precious the lord provided
[52:17] and then i was thinking about uh how
[52:19] this one man said
[52:21] i think he was from over and he was over
[52:23] in one of european countries
[52:27] and it was during the persecution time i
[52:29] think it was either
[52:31] the communists or the or hitler's reign
[52:35] and he said he found out that their
[52:37] greatest enemy was
[52:39] to try to save their lives
[52:41] [Music]
[52:43] he saw that that's what's happening
[52:45] compromising a little here and a little
[52:47] there
[52:48] just to have our life
[52:51] so he he became really bold for the
[52:53] gospel
[52:55] and i think he lives in this country now
[52:57] i don't remember what his name is right
[52:58] now
[52:59] but i thought that was really an
[53:01] interesting point
[53:04] if we lose our life we shall save it
[53:07] if we try to preserve it we're going to
[53:08] lose it
[53:10] and i think that's about where we're in
[53:12] this country
[53:14] there's a tendency to think well we're
[53:15] in america there shouldn't be any
[53:17] persecution here
[53:18] are we willing to stand up and well
[53:21] maybe it's just a little thing
[53:23] but many little things and eventually we
[53:26] come to the point of
[53:28] you know if we're going to continue
[53:29] obeying the government all the time
[53:31] it'll get to the point where are you
[53:34] taking the mark or are you uh
[53:35] there's going to be an antichrist system
[53:37] really
[53:39] so we got to take a stand sometime let's
[53:42] be willing to stand in the small areas
[53:43] too
[53:45] so i bless you
[53:53] [Applause]
[53:55] need a all
[54:22] okay
[54:26] we had such a precious time with brother
[54:28] steve and his family last night and
[54:30] then we sang a couple songs together and
[54:32] he asked us to sing this again today so
[54:35] we want to sing it
[54:44] [Music]
[54:50] me

[58:21] with them all the way
[58:22] you know we just want to give this
[58:23] little testimony they pulled in here
[58:25] yesterday
[58:26] and just as they were getting back in
[58:29] the van to
[58:31] move about the van wouldn't start
[58:35] finally they got it started and we went
[58:39] from the campground to charity's house
[58:42] at 10 miles an hour because the van was
[58:44] in limp mode
[58:46] it's all the faster it would go but by
[58:49] the grace of god
[58:51] when they went from charity's house to
[58:52] my house it was just fine it started
[58:54] fine
[58:55] it ran fine and then nathan came and put
[58:58] a test on it
[58:59] identified the problem brother john got
[59:02] the part
[59:03] put it on yesterday afternoon and we're
[59:06] believing the lord that the van is going
[59:08] to be just fine to take him all the way
[59:10] back
[59:12] [Applause]
[59:16] amen

[59:20] prayer

[59:24] them and they join with us

[1:17:09] praise god would you give these who have
[1:17:12] given their gifts for the lord today
[1:17:14] a thank you we thank you
[1:17:18] we appreciate your help
[1:17:21] turn with me in your bibles if you will
[1:17:23] to john chapter 16
[1:17:26] and we are preaching for some time now
[1:17:30] on having a personal experience with the
[1:17:33] lord jesus christ
[1:17:35] this is not religion this is not church
[1:17:38] entity
[1:17:39] this is not following in the traditions
[1:17:42] of your fathers
[1:17:43] this is meeting jesus christ
[1:17:46] face to face with a personal
[1:17:49] relationship
[1:17:51] knowing that you have met him that you
[1:17:53] are known
[1:17:54] of him and that you know him the bible
[1:17:58] calls it being born again i want
[1:18:02] to know that i'm born again i want you
[1:18:05] to know that you are born again and born
[1:18:08] again
[1:18:08] is not just repenting of your sins
[1:18:12] but there is a process of manifestations
[1:18:15] of grace
[1:18:16] that we experience in our lives that
[1:18:19] complete the process of the new birth
[1:18:22] justification sanctification and the
[1:18:25] baptism
[1:18:26] of the holy ghost without that
[1:18:28] manifestation of god's grace
[1:18:30] in our life we are not yet born again
[1:18:33] we're hung in the birthing canal and we
[1:18:36] need to come all the way
[1:18:38] if you believe that say amen john
[1:18:41] chapter
[1:18:41] 16 is where we want to read beginning in
[1:18:44] verse 7
[1:18:46] nevertheless i tell you the truth
[1:18:50] it is expedient necessary for you that i
[1:18:55] go away
[1:18:57] for if i go not away
[1:19:00] the comforter will not come unto you
[1:19:04] but if i depart i will send him
[1:19:08] unto you and we know that in john
[1:19:11] chapter 14
[1:19:13] the lord jesus explains the coming of
[1:19:16] the comforter
[1:19:18] in verse 8 he said and when he is come
[1:19:22] he will reprove the world
[1:19:26] of sin and of righteousness
[1:19:30] and of judgment
[1:19:33] of sin because they believe not on me
[1:19:37] of righteousness because i go to my
[1:19:40] father
[1:19:41] and ye see me no more of judgment
[1:19:45] because the prince of this world
[1:19:48] is judged verse 12
[1:19:51] i have yet many things to say unto you
[1:19:55] but you cannot bear them now
[1:19:58] howbeit when he the spirit
[1:20:02] of truth is come he will
[1:20:06] guide you do you believe that he will
[1:20:09] guide you into
[1:20:13] all truth
[1:20:16] not just a portion of truth all
[1:20:20] truth that is not doctrine all truth is
[1:20:24] not
[1:20:25] doctrine all truth is a person
[1:20:28] jesus said i am the way
[1:20:32] i am the truth i am the life
[1:20:36] and so doctrine helps us to approach
[1:20:40] jesus christ it gives us a foundation
[1:20:43] but our goal is not to become educated
[1:20:47] our goal is to come into christ
[1:20:51] thank you lord for making a way that
[1:20:54] it's possible
[1:20:55] he will guide you into all truth
[1:20:59] for he shall not speak of himself
[1:21:02] the spirit of truth will not speak
[1:21:05] of himself he will introduce
[1:21:08] someone else he will speak of someone
[1:21:12] else let's read on
[1:21:13] he shall glorify me who is the me
[1:21:17] these are red letters this is the words
[1:21:20] of our lord jesus christ
[1:21:22] he will glorify me for he shall receive
[1:21:26] of mine
[1:21:27] and shall show it unto you all
[1:21:30] things that the father hath are mine
[1:21:34] i want you to know some were listening
[1:21:36] to this
[1:21:37] and they were boiling
[1:21:40] they were boiling their blood was
[1:21:42] boiling
[1:21:43] because here is a prophet they believed
[1:21:46] perhaps who was making himself equal to
[1:21:50] god almighty
[1:21:51] he was saying all things that the father
[1:21:54] hath are mine therefore said i
[1:21:57] that he shall take of mine and he shall
[1:22:00] show it unto you verse 16
[1:22:03] a little while and ye shall not see me
[1:22:07] and again a little while and you shall
[1:22:11] see me because i go
[1:22:14] to the father i want you to know i for
[1:22:17] one
[1:22:18] am thankful that he came and that he
[1:22:20] went
[1:22:21] and because of him going he could come
[1:22:25] in another form he could come in spirit
[1:22:29] form and live inside of the believer
[1:22:32] he has left us with a promise and a hope
[1:22:35] that he will come again
[1:22:37] and we will see him and know him and be
[1:22:40] known of him is that right
[1:22:42] let's go to the lord in prayer father we
[1:22:45] thank you now
[1:22:46] for your wonderful presence that has
[1:22:48] been among us
[1:22:50] we thank you that we can sense that
[1:22:53] you're here
[1:22:54] your word reveals you when we worship
[1:22:58] you come when an atmosphere of welcome
[1:23:02] is created you come and now always thank
[1:23:05] you for
[1:23:06] it we brought you with us when we came
[1:23:09] this morning a little deposit
[1:23:11] of who you are living in our life you
[1:23:14] came with
[1:23:15] us and now all of those little
[1:23:18] individual licks of fire
[1:23:20] that you've given us by the holy ghost
[1:23:22] we are some of us
[1:23:23] united here today bringing back together
[1:23:26] that little lick of fire
[1:23:28] so lord truly you are in the midst
[1:23:32] i pray that your word will accomplish
[1:23:35] that
[1:23:35] which it is sent forth to accomplish
[1:23:37] today we bind
[1:23:39] the hand of the enemy we take authority
[1:23:42] over him
[1:23:43] because we know how he despises
[1:23:46] the preaching of the revealed word of
[1:23:48] god we pray lord that you will help us
[1:23:51] focus
[1:23:51] on you we know there will be some who
[1:23:55] are tired in body and weary and even
[1:23:57] sleepy
[1:23:58] but we pray lord that you would help us
[1:24:01] all to hear
[1:24:02] to be a part to make ourselves a part
[1:24:06] of what you're saying today we access
[1:24:09] that by faith and it's faith that you
[1:24:11] have placed in our lives
[1:24:13] and we want to use it as you have asked
[1:24:16] us
[1:24:17] to to apply it and to use it and
[1:24:20] we access the whole truth with our faith
[1:24:23] today
[1:24:24] and we pray lord that you will continue
[1:24:27] to have your way
[1:24:28] bless in our fellowship later in our
[1:24:31] time together
[1:24:33] we just want to be filled with the
[1:24:35] reality of who you are
[1:24:37] we ask these things in the mighty name
[1:24:41] of the lord jesus christ yeshua our
[1:24:44] messiah
[1:24:45] amen and the church said amen you may be
[1:24:48] seated
[1:24:49] please don't get so quiet
[1:24:52] i i'm a preacher who needs the holy
[1:24:56] spirit
[1:24:57] i need the faith pull of the people
[1:25:01] and i need your amen you're not going to
[1:25:04] make me nervous
[1:25:05] with an amen if it's sincere you're
[1:25:08] going to make me nervous if you don't
[1:25:10] do something nod your head a little bit
[1:25:13] smile if you can
[1:25:16] make yourself a part of what god would
[1:25:19] say to us today
[1:25:21] it's very important that we do that
[1:25:23] because truth
[1:25:25] makes us free we are walking in a
[1:25:28] freedom
[1:25:29] that has been created for us by the
[1:25:32] truth
[1:25:33] you know we say very often the truth
[1:25:36] sets us free but the bible said it makes
[1:25:39] us free
[1:25:40] and the word that is used there in the
[1:25:42] greek is a word that speaks of
[1:25:45] recreation being remolded
[1:25:48] and reformed we who have known bondage
[1:25:52] we who have known
[1:25:53] slavery are now being made
[1:25:56] freedom our whole identity is being
[1:25:59] remolded and reshaped and remade
[1:26:02] and many of us even after all of these
[1:26:04] years we're still learning to walk in
[1:26:06] our new identity
[1:26:07] as freedom we are free and we're free
[1:26:10] because
[1:26:11] jesus has made us thus amen and so
[1:26:15] we're thankful for that we know what it
[1:26:17] means to not be free
[1:26:19] and it makes us more appreciative of
[1:26:21] what it means
[1:26:22] to be free i'm going to share just a few
[1:26:25] of those verses
[1:26:27] that i just shared in the amplified
[1:26:29] bible
[1:26:30] i hope that won't be offensive to anyone
[1:26:33] i just feel like there are some
[1:26:35] words and phrases used here that will be
[1:26:37] a blessing to you
[1:26:39] so i'm going to read beginning in verse
[1:26:41] 7. i might read it all i don't know
[1:26:43] but i'm going to start in verse 7 of
[1:26:46] john 16 and this is in the amplified
[1:26:48] version
[1:26:49] it uses a lot of the original language
[1:26:52] and a lot of the
[1:26:52] various words that are used i i find it
[1:26:56] to be helpful
[1:26:57] however i am telling you nothing but the
[1:26:59] truth
[1:27:00] when i say it is profitable good
[1:27:05] expedient advantageous
[1:27:08] for you that i go away i don't know if
[1:27:12] the disciples
[1:27:13] would have agreed at that moment they
[1:27:16] were holding on to the lord
[1:27:18] they were holding on to fellowship with
[1:27:20] him i
[1:27:21] it's just like those who knew the
[1:27:24] ministry of brother branham
[1:27:25] and saw god in him they just believed
[1:27:29] that he would always be with them
[1:27:31] they kept waiting for the next big thing
[1:27:33] that god was going to do
[1:27:34] the disciples the same way they kept
[1:27:37] waiting
[1:27:38] they thought any minute he might just
[1:27:40] shift his ministry
[1:27:42] and he might run out the occupying roman
[1:27:45] army
[1:27:46] and he might give the people political
[1:27:48] freedom they really didn't know what all
[1:27:50] was going to happen
[1:27:51] but they weren't quite ready to hear i'm
[1:27:54] fixing to leave you
[1:27:55] you you you need to know i'm getting
[1:27:58] ready to be out of here
[1:28:00] so he had to explain to them it's it's
[1:28:02] advantageous to you
[1:28:04] it's going to be to your blessing to
[1:28:06] your benefit that i go
[1:28:08] because we can't both be here at the
[1:28:10] same time
[1:28:11] you know why because they're one in
[1:28:14] spirit
[1:28:15] amen how many of you know the holy ghost
[1:28:18] is not the third member or third person
[1:28:20] of a godhead but he is another
[1:28:23] demonstration
[1:28:24] of the same god the same spirit so you
[1:28:27] couldn't have
[1:28:27] jesus the fullness of god in body on the
[1:28:30] earth
[1:28:31] and the spirit of god loosened the earth
[1:28:33] at the same time
[1:28:34] jesus said i have to go so that he can
[1:28:37] come
[1:28:37] but then he said in chapter 14 i will
[1:28:40] not leave you comfortless
[1:28:42] i will come to you he was identifying to
[1:28:45] them by revelation
[1:28:46] i'm not sending someone else even though
[1:28:49] he said i'll send you another comforter
[1:28:51] it was the spirit of the father that was
[1:28:54] living in him
[1:28:55] that was going to come back on the
[1:28:57] believer and be all the comfort that
[1:28:59] they would ever need i want you to know
[1:29:01] today
[1:29:01] jesus is the only comfort
[1:29:04] that lasts that's enduring
[1:29:08] that is eternal we can we can have
[1:29:11] temporary
[1:29:12] moments of of comfort and contentment
[1:29:15] it's like the little child i saw last
[1:29:17] night one of these little boys
[1:29:19] i don't remember which one it was but i
[1:29:21] saw as they were holding him there at
[1:29:23] the end
[1:29:24] i saw he had a little scab on his knee
[1:29:27] and i almost touched it and then i
[1:29:29] thought no it might be sore
[1:29:30] under there i don't want to touch it and
[1:29:33] there they were getting used to me
[1:29:34] anyway the little little fellas were
[1:29:36] and i didn't want to disturb him but i i
[1:29:39] saw that little
[1:29:40] little scab on his knee i remember those
[1:29:43] scabs
[1:29:44] i remember having four children that had
[1:29:46] those scabs
[1:29:48] i remember myself i i wear a scar
[1:29:52] most of you don't know it but i have a
[1:29:54] scar right here on my
[1:29:55] eyelid that was pretty deep and i have
[1:29:59] it
[1:29:59] goes right through my eyebrow and i have
[1:30:01] it because when i was a child
[1:30:03] i fell over the handlebars of a bicycle
[1:30:06] that i was riding on a dirt trail
[1:30:08] and i went over the handlebars and a
[1:30:11] stick went up there like that
[1:30:13] and and cut through and boy i was at an
[1:30:16] age then i didn't want mama
[1:30:21] a year before i would have run straight
[1:30:23] to mama
[1:30:25] but i was at an age then that that blood
[1:30:27] dripping down my face i didn't even wipe
[1:30:29] it
[1:30:32] i was kind of proud of it i wanted all
[1:30:35] the other guys to see the blood dripping
[1:30:37] down my
[1:30:38] i just kind of wiped it off a little bit
[1:30:39] like that and went all day
[1:30:41] when i went home that night and that
[1:30:43] dried blood on my face and that gash
[1:30:45] hanging open that needed stitches my
[1:30:47] mother was so mad at me
[1:30:49] i said mother i couldn't afford to let
[1:30:51] the guys know i needed my mama
[1:30:54] she said it's not sin to need your
[1:30:56] mother
[1:30:58] she was comfort to me i know that when
[1:31:01] that little
[1:31:02] fella skinned his knee mom and dad they
[1:31:04] comforted him
[1:31:05] but it's a temporary comfort it only
[1:31:08] lasts
[1:31:08] until they forget the pain it only lasts
[1:31:11] until the next accident
[1:31:13] but i want you to know there's a
[1:31:14] comforter
[1:31:16] hallelujah there is a comforter that
[1:31:19] comforts us
[1:31:20] with a comfort that lasts it is
[1:31:22] everlasting it is eternal
[1:31:24] it is not temporary or temporal he said
[1:31:28] he goes on to say it's profitable good
[1:31:31] expedient advantageous for you
[1:31:33] that i go away because if i do not go
[1:31:36] away
[1:31:36] the comforter listen and how he is
[1:31:39] described
[1:31:39] counselor helper advocate
[1:31:43] intercessor strengthener standby
[1:31:46] will not come to you into close
[1:31:50] fellowship with you i like the way
[1:31:54] that is described and when he comes
[1:31:58] he will convict and convince
[1:32:01] i want you to keep those words in your
[1:32:04] mind he will convict
[1:32:06] and convince that's part of the work of
[1:32:09] the holy ghost
[1:32:10] to con to convict and to convince
[1:32:14] he will convict and convince the world
[1:32:17] and bring demonstration
[1:32:19] to it about sin about righteousness
[1:32:23] which is uprightness of heart and right
[1:32:26] standing with god
[1:32:28] and about judgment about sin
[1:32:31] because they do not believe in me trust
[1:32:34] in rely on
[1:32:35] and adhere to me about righteousness
[1:32:38] uprightness of heart and right standing
[1:32:41] with god
[1:32:41] because i go to my father and you will
[1:32:44] see me no longer
[1:32:45] about judgment because the ruler evil
[1:32:48] genius prince of this world
[1:32:50] satan is judged and condemned
[1:32:54] and sentenced already is passed
[1:32:57] upon him how many of you can say amen to
[1:33:00] that
[1:33:01] i want you to look at the word reprove
[1:33:04] found in verse 8 of the king james
[1:33:08] when he is come he will reprove
[1:33:13] i want to give you the greek definition
[1:33:15] of that word
[1:33:16] or the or the english definition from
[1:33:18] the greek
[1:33:20] it means to scrutinize
[1:33:23] or examine carefully
[1:33:26] so when the holy ghost has come he will
[1:33:30] scrutinize
[1:33:32] and examine carefully the world
[1:33:36] of sin of righteousness and of judgment
[1:33:41] it goes on to mean to prove guilty
[1:33:46] to condemn to rebuke to show fault
[1:33:50] or error it means to convince
[1:33:54] to convict to expose
[1:33:57] to bring some shame to the person
[1:34:00] that is being reproved in the church age
[1:34:04] book
[1:34:05] we don't do a lot of quoting from the
[1:34:06] church age book but if you'll put that
[1:34:09] little sentence up there
[1:34:11] i want you to hear what they have taken
[1:34:14] from the message of brother branham
[1:34:16] concerning that word it says to rebuke
[1:34:20] is to reprove to reprove
[1:34:23] is to expose with a view
[1:34:27] to correction to expose with a view
[1:34:31] to correction i wanted to bring that to
[1:34:34] you
[1:34:34] because i want you to understand that
[1:34:36] the work of the holy spirit
[1:34:38] is not to condemn you the work of the
[1:34:41] holy spirit
[1:34:42] is to convict you and to convince you
[1:34:46] that you cannot do it on your own the
[1:34:49] king james uses the word
[1:34:51] condemn and it is a very strong word
[1:34:54] but how many of you know we read in the
[1:34:56] book of romans
[1:34:57] there is therefore now
[1:35:00] help me no condemnation to them which
[1:35:04] are in christ jesus
[1:35:06] so the spirit of god in you is not to
[1:35:08] condemn you and make you feel hopeless
[1:35:11] the spirit of god in us by the baptism
[1:35:14] of the holy ghost
[1:35:15] is there to cause us to be convinced
[1:35:18] that we can't do it by ourself but if we
[1:35:21] lean
[1:35:21] on him and depend on this relationship
[1:35:24] we have with him
[1:35:26] we can overcome all things we can't make
[1:35:29] it without him
[1:35:31] you say well you know i'm not sure if i
[1:35:34] have the holy ghost
[1:35:35] you've got to know you must know i wish
[1:35:38] you'd help me preach this morning
[1:35:40] you must know that you have the baptism
[1:35:43] of the holy ghost hope so
[1:35:45] is not enough i wished i did i wish that
[1:35:48] this is not enough you've got to know
[1:35:50] that you know that you know that you
[1:35:52] know that you know
[1:35:53] because we're facing things now and what
[1:35:56] we're facing now
[1:35:58] it doesn't even begin to compare with
[1:36:00] what we will face
[1:36:01] we need the helper in us we need the
[1:36:05] advocate
[1:36:06] in us we need the one who comes to
[1:36:09] convince us
[1:36:10] and to convict us we need him living in
[1:36:13] us
[1:36:13] the work of the holy ghost is not
[1:36:15] finished when we come to christ
[1:36:17] when we come to the new birth and he
[1:36:19] first deals with our heart
[1:36:21] and we pray and cry and repent and we
[1:36:23] come to justification
[1:36:25] and then the water washes us by the word
[1:36:28] and we come to sanctification
[1:36:30] and then we receive the baptism of the
[1:36:32] holy ghost he feels so good
[1:36:34] he feels so good in our life he gives us
[1:36:37] joy
[1:36:38] he gives us fire he gives us peace but i
[1:36:41] want you to know his work is not
[1:36:43] finished
[1:36:43] he continues to remain in us to convince
[1:36:47] us
[1:36:47] to convict us to guide us
[1:36:51] to lead us to show us the way
[1:36:54] when he the spirit of truth is come not
[1:36:57] only into the world but into the bride
[1:36:59] when he come into us by the baptism of
[1:37:02] the holy ghost
[1:37:03] he is there to guide us he is there to
[1:37:06] lead us
[1:37:07] he is there to direct us into all truth
[1:37:09] he's there to nudge us
[1:37:11] when we look at the wrong thing he's
[1:37:14] there to nudge us
[1:37:15] when we say the wrong thing he's there
[1:37:17] to nudge us
[1:37:18] when we think the wrong thing and he
[1:37:21] doesn't do it with condemnation
[1:37:23] if if it fills you with guilt and
[1:37:26] condemnation
[1:37:27] it's a trick of the accuser it's not the
[1:37:29] work of the holy spirit
[1:37:31] the trick of the accuser is to condemn
[1:37:34] us and make us feel like there is no
[1:37:36] hope
[1:37:36] the work of the holy spirit in us is to
[1:37:39] remind us
[1:37:40] i will give you power over all the
[1:37:42] powers of the enemy
[1:37:44] because i overcame the world you can
[1:37:46] also overcome
[1:37:48] we've really got something when we have
[1:37:51] this holy ghost
[1:37:52] living on the inside of us we need it
[1:37:54] somebody said what about the word
[1:37:56] we now have the word of god reveal we
[1:37:58] now have that which is perfect
[1:38:00] we now have the right interpretation and
[1:38:02] revelation
[1:38:03] of the lord jesus christ so perhaps we
[1:38:06] don't really need to emphasize the holy
[1:38:08] ghost anymore
[1:38:09] i want you to know we must emphasize our
[1:38:12] need
[1:38:12] we must tell our children and our
[1:38:15] children's children
[1:38:16] that god has no grandchildren and we
[1:38:19] must tarry and wade
[1:38:21] and pray and fast and do whatever else
[1:38:24] we can do
[1:38:25] until we know that we have received the
[1:38:28] baptism
[1:38:29] of the holy ghost and the fire that
[1:38:31] purges us
[1:38:32] from the all of that that inbred sin
[1:38:35] and gives us deliverance and freedom
[1:38:38] over all that the enemy is trying to use
[1:38:40] to destroy us always when the holy
[1:38:42] spirit comes and convicts
[1:38:45] he gives us hope and he gives us
[1:38:46] correction and he shows us a better way
[1:38:51] there's a higher life when the accuser
[1:38:53] comes
[1:38:54] he says you'll never be any better than
[1:38:56] that
[1:38:58] you'll never get over that you'll never
[1:39:01] quit watching you'll never quit saying
[1:39:03] you'll never quit thinking this is who
[1:39:05] you are and you always will be
[1:39:07] when you hear that voice that is not the
[1:39:10] voice of the holy ghost
[1:39:11] he don't talk like that i wished i had
[1:39:13] some help
[1:39:15] how many of you know what phantom pain
[1:39:17] is
[1:39:18] you've heard the word phantom pain
[1:39:22] they tell me that many times an amputee
[1:39:26] someone who has a mortal injury serious
[1:39:28] injury
[1:39:29] to a to an arm or to a leg and it has to
[1:39:33] be amputated
[1:39:34] it has to be taken off they tell me that
[1:39:37] the brain
[1:39:38] doesn't catch up right away the brain
[1:39:41] doesn't recognize immediately
[1:39:44] that the limb is gone and that it is
[1:39:46] possible to go
[1:39:48] for an extended amount of time god bless
[1:39:50] you josiah i just saw you
[1:39:52] it's possible to go for a long period of
[1:39:55] time still feeling awful pain
[1:39:57] in a foot that's not there
[1:40:03] in a leg that's not there it's really
[1:40:05] interesting isn't it
[1:40:06] because the brain hasn't caught up it
[1:40:09] hasn't regenerated itself enough
[1:40:12] to recognize what has happened and what
[1:40:14] has changed in the body
[1:40:16] i want you to know that the enemy works
[1:40:18] like that
[1:40:21] i want you to know that he wants you to
[1:40:23] feel the awful guilt of sin
[1:40:26] that is no longer there because the
[1:40:28] blood of jesus has already dealt with it
[1:40:31] he'll cause you to feel guilt and
[1:40:33] condemnation
[1:40:34] over something that's already been
[1:40:36] placed under the blood he's a liar
[1:40:39] jesus said the father of all lies all
[1:40:42] the lies come from him
[1:40:44] and you've got to recognize the
[1:40:46] difference between
[1:40:47] the voice of the accuser and the working
[1:40:50] of the holy spirit
[1:40:52] of the holy ghost in your life when when
[1:40:55] he
[1:40:56] the holy ghost points out something that
[1:40:59] needs to be changed in your life
[1:41:01] he does it with such love he does it
[1:41:03] with such
[1:41:04] grace because you belong to him
[1:41:07] now it hurts sometimes we're not talking
[1:41:10] about the whipping
[1:41:12] how many of you know them that the lord
[1:41:14] loves he chastens
[1:41:16] that is going to make you feel kind of
[1:41:18] sore for a while
[1:41:20] that's not what we're talking about the
[1:41:22] discipline of the lord
[1:41:24] to make us better disciples this is
[1:41:26] something that we not only accept
[1:41:28] it's something that we welcome because
[1:41:30] if he doesn't discipline us
[1:41:32] we are none of his but we are
[1:41:34] illegitimate children
[1:41:36] so there are times that the work of the
[1:41:38] lord in our life will bring discipline
[1:41:40] to us
[1:41:40] to make us greater disciples for him but
[1:41:43] it doesn't come with the guilt and the
[1:41:44] condemnation that the voice of the
[1:41:46] accuser comes with
[1:41:48] i want you to understand the difference
[1:41:50] when we look at that word convict it
[1:41:52] means to prick a person's heart
[1:41:54] until he senses and knows that he is
[1:41:56] guilty of something
[1:41:58] that does not please the lord i want to
[1:42:00] just ask you how many of you have ever
[1:42:01] felt
[1:42:02] the convicting prick of the lord
[1:42:09] maybe when we first started to serve him
[1:42:12] we feel that prick and it would really
[1:42:15] weigh us down
[1:42:17] and cause us to feel like another
[1:42:19] failure
[1:42:20] it would almost make us wonder if we
[1:42:22] were really saved
[1:42:24] how many of you remember in your early
[1:42:26] christian journey the enemy was
[1:42:28] always hanging around why you're not a
[1:42:29] christian
[1:42:31] why you're not a real believer or you
[1:42:34] wouldn't think a thing like that
[1:42:35] but as we become more mature in the word
[1:42:38] we understand
[1:42:39] that it doesn't change who we are as a
[1:42:42] christian
[1:42:43] because we fail because he's already
[1:42:46] taken care of the work
[1:42:49] he comes not to make us feel like we're
[1:42:52] not even saved
[1:42:53] he comes to help us to understand where
[1:42:56] our hope is
[1:42:57] where our help comes from where our
[1:42:59] strength is i want to tell you today
[1:43:01] no matter where you are there's nothing
[1:43:03] that you are struggling with in this
[1:43:05] hour
[1:43:06] that the wonderful spirit of god can't
[1:43:09] give you help and grace to overcome
[1:43:11] but you've got to lean on the advocate
[1:43:13] you've got to lean on the comforter
[1:43:16] and if you don't have him living on the
[1:43:18] inside of you
[1:43:19] by the baptism of the holy ghost you're
[1:43:21] missing out
[1:43:23] if he's not on board how many of you are
[1:43:25] glad you know
[1:43:26] that the holy ghost is on board he's on
[1:43:29] board
[1:43:30] he goes with me he keeps me
[1:43:34] boy when i think something when
[1:43:36] something comes into my mind
[1:43:38] that ought not to be there some some
[1:43:42] i don't know what you'd say something
[1:43:45] that i know that is not of him
[1:43:47] something that i know is not what i want
[1:43:50] to be
[1:43:50] and what he would have me to be that old
[1:43:53] enemy
[1:43:54] he will start screaming and if you
[1:43:57] listen to him
[1:43:58] you won't be listening to the holy
[1:44:00] spirit you'll be listening to the black
[1:44:02] dog
[1:44:03] remember what brother branham told us
[1:44:04] about the two dogs the indian story
[1:44:07] whichever one you feed the most is the
[1:44:09] one that's going to
[1:44:10] bark the loudest you're going to hear
[1:44:12] from him the most
[1:44:14] and every man has that struggle going on
[1:44:16] even the the great apostle paul
[1:44:18] in my innermost being there's a warfare
[1:44:21] going on
[1:44:22] when i try to do good it seems like evil
[1:44:25] is present
[1:44:26] that's the key that's the key
[1:44:29] the word as it has been revealed to us
[1:44:32] in this hour is to set us free
[1:44:35] from the guilt and the condemnation that
[1:44:38] comes with failure
[1:44:40] it is to give us a sense of maturity and
[1:44:43] to help us to understand
[1:44:44] when we fall we get back up
[1:44:48] when we fail the lord we repent
[1:44:52] have mercy on me lord give me
[1:44:55] strength and grace to never do it again
[1:44:58] but we don't lay out a church because we
[1:45:01] failed
[1:45:02] and we don't think we have to go back
[1:45:03] and be saved all over again
[1:45:05] because we failed i want you to know
[1:45:08] calvary
[1:45:08] has finished the work in my life
[1:45:13] i just have to recognize which voice i'm
[1:45:16] listening to
[1:45:17] why you know that old enemy he'll come
[1:45:19] like job's wife
[1:45:24] he'll say you ought to just curse god
[1:45:26] and die
[1:45:28] you look this precious family
[1:45:32] has gone through a tragedy since we saw
[1:45:34] them last
[1:45:36] there was a terrible accident on an icy
[1:45:38] road
[1:45:39] and a little twin grandbaby was lost
[1:45:43] that little mother that whole family
[1:45:46] of course they have grieved and of
[1:45:48] course
[1:45:49] they feel the loss but they have come to
[1:45:52] a place
[1:45:53] like you and i have to come we have to
[1:45:56] come to a place and say the lord
[1:45:58] does not make mistakes
[1:46:02] it's a big statement he doesn't make
[1:46:05] mistakes
[1:46:07] if god allows something to come into our
[1:46:09] life
[1:46:10] it comes for a purpose it comes for a
[1:46:13] reason
[1:46:13] and even though it tears our heart and
[1:46:16] it even tears our flesh
[1:46:18] and it tears our emotions our response
[1:46:21] has to be in this hour
[1:46:22] blessed be the name of the lord the lord
[1:46:25] gives
[1:46:26] and the lord takes away blessed be the
[1:46:29] name of the lord i don't mean to keep
[1:46:31] referring to this little group
[1:46:32] but brother greeley told you they lost
[1:46:34] their leader
[1:46:35] who had the vision for the group who had
[1:46:39] been such a tremendous blessing in their
[1:46:42] lives
[1:46:43] and he was sick and i know they must
[1:46:46] have believed god
[1:46:47] right to the end that he would be
[1:46:49] restored and receive a miracle
[1:46:52] he did get a miracle he was restored
[1:46:55] he now has a brand new body
[1:46:59] he now walks in a brand new life he has
[1:47:02] now reached a goal
[1:47:04] i want you to know that all of us are
[1:47:05] working toward but it doesn't it doesn't
[1:47:07] always
[1:47:08] take the pain and the loss and the grief
[1:47:12] that we go through
[1:47:13] there are things that we don't
[1:47:14] understand but we know that god sees
[1:47:17] what we cannot
[1:47:18] see he hears and and perceives things
[1:47:21] that we cannot
[1:47:22] and we just keep pressing toward that
[1:47:24] work
[1:47:25] pressing toward that mark and allowing
[1:47:28] the holy ghost
[1:47:29] to bring comfort to our heart to to show
[1:47:32] us the way to help us not to cling to
[1:47:35] one another
[1:47:36] but to cling to him now we will cling to
[1:47:39] one another
[1:47:40] as we cling to him but i want you to
[1:47:42] know that cannot be our strength
[1:47:44] it can't be found in one another because
[1:47:47] you may be taken from me
[1:47:49] i may be taken from you but there's one
[1:47:52] who's going to walk with you
[1:47:53] all the way to the end god didn't want
[1:47:56] to just walk beside you
[1:47:57] he wanted to live inside you don't you
[1:48:00] miss your opportunity to have the god of
[1:48:03] all eternity
[1:48:04] living inside of you by the baptism of
[1:48:07] the holy ghost
[1:48:08] are you with me now the scripture said
[1:48:11] here in verse 8
[1:48:14] when the holy ghost comes when this
[1:48:16] comforter comes
[1:48:17] he's going to reprove the world of sin
[1:48:21] because they believe not on me
[1:48:23] [Music]
[1:48:24] the work of the holy ghost in
[1:48:27] in this aspect or this dimension
[1:48:31] is to help us to understand that
[1:48:34] unbelief
[1:48:36] is the foundation of sin unbelief
[1:48:40] is the source of sinfulness and if we
[1:48:43] don't deal
[1:48:44] with unbelief we will die in our sin
[1:48:49] unbelief ultimately has to be conquered
[1:48:53] or we will die in our sin do you believe
[1:48:56] that to be the truth
[1:48:58] could we share a little quotation
[1:49:01] from the message thou knowest all things
[1:49:04] hammond indiana
[1:49:06] he said now we know drinking and
[1:49:09] carrying on is sin
[1:49:11] but the whole thing is because
[1:49:14] of unbelief he said because if you
[1:49:17] believe
[1:49:18] god and jesus christ to be his son
[1:49:22] you are absolutely not going to do
[1:49:26] those things how many of you can
[1:49:29] understand that
[1:49:31] he said you believe that he's that
[1:49:35] born he that's born of god does not
[1:49:38] commit sin see
[1:49:39] all right he said you must
[1:49:43] believe i like this next phrase
[1:49:47] he said the whole thing lays
[1:49:50] in faith we cannot underestimate the
[1:49:55] power
[1:49:56] of faith in our life faith is where it's
[1:50:00] laying
[1:50:01] he said jesus said he that heareth my
[1:50:04] words
[1:50:05] and believeth on him that sent me
[1:50:08] hath everlasting life shall not
[1:50:12] come into condemnation but has
[1:50:15] already passed from death into life did
[1:50:19] you hear the word already
[1:50:20] that was the words of jesus he said do
[1:50:22] you believe that's the truth
[1:50:24] he said there it lays there isn't
[1:50:27] nothing else that you can do
[1:50:29] only believe
[1:50:33] my the church has made it complicated
[1:50:39] the church has made it so complicated
[1:50:42] jesus simplifies it all the prophet
[1:50:46] wanted to make it simple for us
[1:50:48] he said it all boils down to this only
[1:50:52] believe that's where faith works
[1:50:55] he said and if you believe then them
[1:50:58] little immoral things
[1:51:00] do we need to name them he said
[1:51:04] drinking and carrying on that's not all
[1:51:07] that's immoral
[1:51:09] we're living in an hour as we were
[1:51:12] praying last night this came to my mind
[1:51:14] we're living in an hour where we can
[1:51:17] we carry anything and everything in the
[1:51:19] palm of our hand
[1:51:21] anything and everything in the palm of
[1:51:23] our hand
[1:51:24] it's much good and much much evil
[1:51:29] and i want you to know don't you think
[1:51:30] that you or yours
[1:51:32] will be immune to the pull of the world
[1:51:36] to the pull of the enemy but when we can
[1:51:38] only believe
[1:51:40] when we can access the goodness of god
[1:51:42] by faith
[1:51:43] and understand the work that is being
[1:51:45] accomplished in us
[1:51:47] by the working of the holy ghost when we
[1:51:49] can do that
[1:51:50] then brother branham said all these
[1:51:52] little immoral things they start falling
[1:51:54] off
[1:51:55] i want you to hear him describe it he
[1:51:57] said they start falling off
[1:51:59] they drop off like that as you believe
[1:52:02] listen to this
[1:52:03] as you believe you become
[1:52:07] love as you believe
[1:52:11] you become love and love
[1:52:14] is god and you begin to wind yourself
[1:52:19] into christ and these other things you
[1:52:22] don't have to quit doing them
[1:52:28] did you hear it you don't have to quit
[1:52:30] doing them
[1:52:31] they quit themselves
[1:52:35] i wonder if anybody believes that if
[1:52:37] you've ever had the genuine baptism of
[1:52:39] the holy ghost you'll believe that
[1:52:42] because he will so change your desire
[1:52:47] he will so change the things you love
[1:52:50] the old timers used to testify that
[1:52:52] which i hated i now love
[1:52:54] that which i that which i used to love i
[1:52:57] now hate
[1:52:58] it's a complete turnaround the things i
[1:53:01] used to enjoy
[1:53:02] i hate them now the things i used to
[1:53:04] hate i love them now
[1:53:06] who did that it wasn't just making up
[1:53:09] your mind
[1:53:10] it was the ministry of the holy spirit
[1:53:12] in your life
[1:53:13] he said they just quit themselves
[1:53:15] there's just no desire to do it
[1:53:17] i've told you many many times about my
[1:53:19] own mother
[1:53:20] who tried to quit she tried to quit
[1:53:22] smoking
[1:53:23] she had smoked all of her life she tried
[1:53:25] to quit
[1:53:26] she'd do real good for a while and then
[1:53:29] she would smoke double for a while
[1:53:32] she would then quit again and
[1:53:35] then she would catch up all that she
[1:53:37] lost
[1:53:38] she just seemed to not be able to do it
[1:53:40] so she just finally said
[1:53:42] you have to die with something i know
[1:53:45] it's killing me but you have to die with
[1:53:46] something
[1:53:47] and she said i like them and i'm just
[1:53:49] not going to quit well i knew that
[1:53:51] wasn't right
[1:53:52] i knew that wasn't god i knew that
[1:53:55] wasn't really her
[1:53:57] i knew that was the devil talking to her
[1:54:00] but i want you to know one day the
[1:54:01] spirit of god came in the automobile
[1:54:04] when she was driving across the bridge
[1:54:06] on the way to work
[1:54:07] the presence of god came in the
[1:54:09] automobile in such a powerful way
[1:54:11] as an answer to my prayers and many
[1:54:13] others who had prayed for her
[1:54:15] and the thought dropped down in her
[1:54:16] heart she rolled the window down
[1:54:18] she threw the cigarette out over the
[1:54:20] edge of the bridge and she said
[1:54:22] lord if you'll save me if you'll fill
[1:54:25] me i'll never smoke again
[1:54:30] you say how in the world is that
[1:54:32] possible someone who had tried and tried
[1:54:34] and tried there's the key
[1:54:36] she tried on her own power she tried on
[1:54:38] her own strength
[1:54:39] if you're trying to please god by your
[1:54:42] own strength
[1:54:43] you're just striving and striving will
[1:54:46] lead to torment
[1:54:49] but if you're allowing the holy ghost in
[1:54:52] you
[1:54:53] to live this life if you're allowing the
[1:54:56] holy ghost in you
[1:54:57] to cause you to drop off the things that
[1:55:00] need to be dropped off
[1:55:01] then i want you to know you won't find
[1:55:03] it a struggle
[1:55:04] you'll find it a joy she said i don't
[1:55:07] want him anymore
[1:55:08] the desire is gone she grew up
[1:55:12] in an atmosphere uh in church because of
[1:55:15] the things that we were taught
[1:55:17] we were told you don't pray for god to
[1:55:19] take those things
[1:55:20] because they're filthy and he didn't
[1:55:22] give them to you so she wasn't praying
[1:55:24] that way
[1:55:25] she was just trying to do it by herself
[1:55:27] but when she surrendered
[1:55:29] and how did it happen in a supernatural
[1:55:31] way the presence of god just came into
[1:55:33] the automobile
[1:55:34] let me tell you something he'll come to
[1:55:36] you
[1:55:38] he'll come to you i'm not going to ask
[1:55:39] you how many of you have something in
[1:55:41] your life that you'd like to be finished
[1:55:42] with
[1:55:43] but i'm sure there are many of us who
[1:55:45] have something in our life we'd like to
[1:55:47] be finished with
[1:55:48] and we strive to get rid of it on our
[1:55:50] own and strive not to ever do such a
[1:55:52] thing or think
[1:55:52] such a thing again and i want you to
[1:55:54] know all the help we need is in us if we
[1:55:56] receive the holy ghost
[1:56:00] you know they used to teach you've got
[1:56:01] to get right before you can receive the
[1:56:03] holy ghost
[1:56:04] if that were the truth of the bible that
[1:56:06] it absolutely defeats the purpose of the
[1:56:08] holy ghost coming
[1:56:10] he comes to help you he comes to be your
[1:56:13] advocate he comes to be your help
[1:56:17] he comes to be your strength he said you
[1:56:19] don't have to quit doing them they just
[1:56:20] quit themselves
[1:56:21] there's just no desire to do it the
[1:56:23] worshiper having purged
[1:56:25] has no more conscience or desire of sin
[1:56:27] hebrews
[1:56:28] 9 he said when the worshiper is purged
[1:56:31] it's when he's born again when the old
[1:56:34] nature dies
[1:56:35] and a new nature sets in then he becomes
[1:56:38] a part of god
[1:56:39] a son of god do you believe that he gets
[1:56:43] new life
[1:56:44] and and he said the greek word there is
[1:56:47] zoe
[1:56:48] which means the life of god
[1:56:51] and you become an offspring of god
[1:56:55] and god can't hurt you without hurting
[1:56:58] himself
[1:57:00] see what i mean i tell you that's a word
[1:57:05] that's a word that's how god looks at
[1:57:06] you that's how he looks at you he
[1:57:09] doesn't want
[1:57:10] to bring you harm he doesn't delight
[1:57:14] in allowing difficulty in your life
[1:57:16] because you're a part of him
[1:57:19] if it hurts you it hurts him but he also
[1:57:22] understands that there's a greater glory
[1:57:24] that's being worked in
[1:57:25] us there's something being changed on
[1:57:28] the inside
[1:57:29] of the inside can i give you another one
[1:57:31] here
[1:57:32] letting off the pressure
[1:57:36] he said now you say brother adam i don't
[1:57:38] smoke or drink or chew or commit
[1:57:40] adultery
[1:57:40] he said that ain't it he said that's not
[1:57:44] sin
[1:57:45] that's the attributes of sin
[1:57:49] that's the attribute of unbelief see he
[1:57:51] said see
[1:57:52] if you believed you wouldn't do that he
[1:57:55] said no that's not
[1:57:56] that ain't what sin is unbelief is sin
[1:57:59] he that believeth not is condemned
[1:58:02] already
[1:58:03] that's just an attribute of unbelief
[1:58:06] he said but if you can't beat all that
[1:58:08] away from you
[1:58:10] say lord god i believe now here's good
[1:58:13] advice
[1:58:14] church if you can't just beat it back
[1:58:17] if you can't just push it out of your
[1:58:19] life on your own strength
[1:58:22] the prophet realized there's a struggle
[1:58:25] just like the writers of the new
[1:58:26] testament understood
[1:58:28] that there's a struggle he said then
[1:58:31] just say lord god
[1:58:33] i believe exactly what your word
[1:58:36] said and i believe as we preached last
[1:58:40] night
[1:58:40] that the appearing of the lord comes
[1:58:42] before the coming of the lord
[1:58:44] how many of you understand he appears
[1:58:47] before
[1:58:48] he comes he has appeared
[1:58:51] the lord has appeared he has appeared in
[1:58:54] the fullness of his word
[1:58:57] but he is coming the appearance
[1:59:00] doesn't replace the coming the
[1:59:02] appearance
[1:59:03] or the appearing foreruns the coming
[1:59:07] he's coming he has come
[1:59:10] he is coming now that's good to know
[1:59:14] he said you just say lord i believe
[1:59:17] and you hold on to that he said for it's
[1:59:20] just two different words altogether now
[1:59:22] the appearing
[1:59:23] as he promised in the last days that
[1:59:25] he'd be with us
[1:59:26] i like this he said and what a refuge
[1:59:29] what a consolation it is
[1:59:31] christians that we can stand here
[1:59:34] tonight in the presence of god
[1:59:36] in the face of his word and in the um
[1:59:39] and
[1:59:40] the impossibility that he promised in
[1:59:42] here we can see manifested right before
[1:59:44] us what a wonderful thing
[1:59:45] he said if that isn't a refuge if that
[1:59:48] isn't a haven of
[1:59:49] rest then i don't know what would be
[1:59:53] to see jesus who said the works that i
[1:59:55] do
[1:59:56] shall you do also oh what a promise that
[1:59:58] is now
[1:59:59] how many believe that that's the truth
[2:00:00] all right and then he goes into prayer
[2:00:03] so the prophet was telling us that
[2:00:06] instead of trying to start
[2:00:08] by dealing with all of the little
[2:00:09] attributes of sin
[2:00:11] you'll get caught up in the struggle
[2:00:16] you'll get caught up in the striving
[2:00:19] you'll get caught up listening to the
[2:00:20] voice of the accuser
[2:00:22] instead of doing all of that you need to
[2:00:24] go to the root of all
[2:00:26] the attributes of sin that's the work of
[2:00:29] the holy spirit he comes
[2:00:31] to reprove the world of sin to convince
[2:00:34] the world that there's a higher way than
[2:00:37] living in unbelief
[2:00:39] how many of you believe how many of you
[2:00:42] believe that your sin
[2:00:44] debt is taken care of by the blood of
[2:00:46] the lamb
[2:00:47] how many of you believe that do you
[2:00:49] really believe it
[2:00:50] do you really believe it to the point of
[2:00:52] no longer struggling with the reality of
[2:00:54] it
[2:00:55] you may feel the mental oppression you
[2:00:57] may feel the mental battle
[2:00:59] but the word says the prophet was
[2:01:02] teaching us here
[2:01:03] if you're just still trying to beat that
[2:01:05] stuff away on your own accord i'll never
[2:01:07] think that
[2:01:08] again i'll never think that again i'll
[2:01:09] never think that again and you're trying
[2:01:11] to do it by yourself
[2:01:12] you'll wear yourself out how many of you
[2:01:15] know by experience because you've tried
[2:01:17] it that way
[2:01:18] you'll wear yourself out but if you'll
[2:01:20] surrender to what you have
[2:01:22] already testified of receiving the
[2:01:25] baptism
[2:01:26] the life of god the holy ghost the zoe
[2:01:29] life of god
[2:01:30] living inside of the believer if we
[2:01:32] surrender to that we don't have to do
[2:01:33] the beating anymore
[2:01:35] we just say lord i believe i'm trying to
[2:01:38] get
[2:01:38] get these things taken care of i'm
[2:01:40] trying but but there's something
[2:01:42] i need your help lord i'm just going to
[2:01:44] tell you i believe your word
[2:01:45] i believe that you died for me i believe
[2:01:48] that you paid a price with your own
[2:01:49] blood
[2:01:50] i'm not a doubter i believe if you feel
[2:01:53] unbelief creeping in you just change
[2:01:55] your prayer just a tad
[2:01:57] you just say lord i believe help bow my
[2:01:59] unbelief
[2:02:01] i'm struggling with that but i know that
[2:02:03] there's a belief in me
[2:02:05] listen i've been studying some things
[2:02:08] that brother branham preached about the
[2:02:09] difference between faith in god and the
[2:02:11] faith of god
[2:02:12] it's powerful it's powerful we may not
[2:02:15] realize there's a complete difference
[2:02:17] but he said it's a different dimension
[2:02:20] he said having faith in god
[2:02:22] and having the faith of god is another
[2:02:24] dimension
[2:02:25] now i want to be right in the middle of
[2:02:26] a bride that starts operating in the
[2:02:28] faith of god
[2:02:32] because faith in god gets shaky
[2:02:34] sometimes
[2:02:35] based on circumstances but he fills you
[2:02:38] with the faith
[2:02:38] of god and there's no room for doubt
[2:02:42] there's only room for reality because
[2:02:45] the faith of god will always take a hold
[2:02:48] of the promise
[2:02:49] it'll never fall short in reaching for
[2:02:51] the promise
[2:02:52] your faith may miss but the faith of god
[2:02:55] in you will never miss
[2:02:56] oh lord fill us fill us
[2:03:00] with that faith with that faith
[2:03:06] i want to read another and then i'm
[2:03:08] going on
[2:03:09] i still have a little time i'm going to
[2:03:12] thank you for that
[2:03:14] in a message called planting the vine
[2:03:16] and where to plant it
[2:03:19] this may be a little obscure this
[2:03:20] message but it's powerful
[2:03:22] 1959 planting the vine and where to
[2:03:25] plant it
[2:03:26] paragraph 59 he said people don't
[2:03:28] believe in shouting
[2:03:31] did you know there's people that don't
[2:03:32] believe in shouting
[2:03:36] when i say that i can just hear the old
[2:03:38] timers
[2:03:39] they used to say if you don't like
[2:03:40] shouting don't get on my cloud
[2:03:44] because on my cloud i'm going to shout
[2:03:46] and praise god and worship god
[2:03:48] all the way through he said now people
[2:03:50] don't believe in shouting
[2:03:52] he said the thing of it is they haven't
[2:03:53] got spiritual joy
[2:03:56] no wonder some of you look so sour i
[2:03:59] love you
[2:04:01] but some of you look mighty sour
[2:04:06] it's a good thing the camera's not two
[2:04:08] ways here
[2:04:10] i can't see what they look like out
[2:04:11] there i can only see what you look like
[2:04:13] in here i'm sure there are many of us
[2:04:16] who can really look sour
[2:04:18] this is not the atmosphere to look sour
[2:04:20] in is it
[2:04:22] he said the thing of it is they've got
[2:04:23] no spiritual joy i want you to know i
[2:04:26] want to testify today
[2:04:27] i don't want to brag but i want to
[2:04:29] testify today god has
[2:04:30] filled me with spiritual joy
[2:04:33] i have joy that i don't understand
[2:04:36] i have joy that i don't deserve
[2:04:40] i have joy that doesn't run congruent
[2:04:43] with my circumstances
[2:04:45] because sometimes i don't have any
[2:04:47] reason
[2:04:48] to feel that joy you know why i can say
[2:04:52] that i have been filled with this kind
[2:04:53] of joy because i'm determined to have it
[2:04:56] i read that it's part of my inheritance
[2:04:59] and i find that all i have to do to come
[2:05:01] back to joy
[2:05:02] is worship him that's all i have to do
[2:05:04] is worship him i want to say that again
[2:05:09] when circumstances knock me out of joy
[2:05:13] when my when my frustration gets out of
[2:05:16] hand
[2:05:17] like benjamin's song he sings when when
[2:05:20] when troubles overwhelm me i know
[2:05:25] a key that is worth passing on
[2:05:29] if i can stop what i'm doing and stop
[2:05:32] what i'm thinking
[2:05:34] and make up my mind how good he is
[2:05:38] oh how good you are how good you've been
[2:05:43] to me lord how faithful you have been
[2:05:47] you have seen me through again and again
[2:05:49] and again and again and again
[2:05:51] i want to praise you because of who you
[2:05:54] are
[2:05:56] whoo as a parent
[2:06:00] hello as a parent it's easy to get
[2:06:04] knocked out of joy
[2:06:07] just being honest you better know what
[2:06:10] you're getting into
[2:06:12] don't have a baby just because you can
[2:06:17] you better know what you're agreeing to
[2:06:20] you better know you can see it all the
[2:06:22] way through
[2:06:24] amen because it doesn't end in the
[2:06:26] diapers when the diapers in
[2:06:28] the parenting is just getting started
[2:06:31] let me tell you something the the
[2:06:32] teenage years and the early 20 years if
[2:06:35] they're still at home
[2:06:36] that's when the real parenting has to
[2:06:38] kick in
[2:06:41] amen i'm blessed i'm not complaining
[2:06:44] i'm not complaining at all i'm blessed
[2:06:47] when i get prayer requests from around
[2:06:49] the world i know how blessed i am
[2:06:51] when people reach out to tell me what's
[2:06:53] going on in their home and in their
[2:06:55] family i know how blessed i am
[2:06:57] when i have believers of this message
[2:06:59] reach out to me and tell me
[2:07:00] that their 21 year old son just decked
[2:07:03] his dad
[2:07:04] i know how blessed i am come on now
[2:07:10] because that's just not going to happen
[2:07:12] where i live
[2:07:15] that's just not the way the order is
[2:07:17] supposed to be
[2:07:19] but when you're dealing with the
[2:07:20] problems of life because the bigger they
[2:07:22] get the bigger problems they can have
[2:07:24] and when love interests start getting
[2:07:26] involved oh my
[2:07:28] that's where you really start finding
[2:07:31] that it's easy to get out of joy
[2:07:34] your heart gets a little broke and you
[2:07:36] see them
[2:07:37] walking through something and you want
[2:07:39] them to know that they know that they
[2:07:40] know that they know that they know
[2:07:42] and you can easily get in a tither and
[2:07:44] you could easily stay up all night
[2:07:47] not praying but worrying but i want you
[2:07:50] to know what i have found
[2:07:51] out all i have to do is throw my hands
[2:07:54] up
[2:07:54] get where i can and if i can't get
[2:07:56] somewhere just do it where i am
[2:07:58] throw up my hands and say lord you have
[2:08:00] never failed me
[2:08:02] i want to thank you because you're god's
[2:08:04] sovereign you are god's supreme
[2:08:06] you are god holy you sit above it all
[2:08:09] you are master and lord of every
[2:08:11] situation
[2:08:12] you have promised me my family you have
[2:08:14] promised me my children
[2:08:15] you have promised me that they were
[2:08:17] going to become lord you have said
[2:08:19] i want to put my i tell you i can't help
[2:08:21] it i can't help it it doesn't matter how
[2:08:22] black it
[2:08:23] is how dark it is how serious it is
[2:08:25] there's a joy
[2:08:27] that starts rolling over in the depth of
[2:08:30] my spirit
[2:08:31] hallelujah i sometimes have to jump
[2:08:36] i sometimes have to dance somebody said
[2:08:38] oh there's nothing in there
[2:08:39] oh that's just emotion let me tell you
[2:08:41] something yours may be emotion
[2:08:45] but i have found something that's deeper
[2:08:47] than an emotion
[2:08:49] i have a river gets in my belly isn't
[2:08:51] that what he promised
[2:08:53] didn't jesus say out of men's bellies
[2:08:55] will flow rivers
[2:08:56] of living water and you can't have a
[2:08:58] river in your belly and not have some
[2:09:00] joy
[2:09:01] to go with it there's a joy thief
[2:09:04] that wants to steal your joy
[2:09:07] there's a circumstance that he will send
[2:09:10] your way
[2:09:10] there's an accusation that he will raise
[2:09:13] against you
[2:09:14] because he wants to steal your joy
[2:09:16] you've got to tell him
[2:09:17] no more the joy of the lord is not my
[2:09:21] feeling
[2:09:23] the joy of the lord is not my emotion
[2:09:25] the joy
[2:09:26] of the lord is my strength
[2:09:29] it's how i can fight it's how i can
[2:09:32] press
[2:09:33] it's how i can go on and all i have to
[2:09:36] do
[2:09:36] i'm telling you the truth all i have to
[2:09:38] do to come back to joy
[2:09:40] is take just a moment to worship him
[2:09:42] praise him
[2:09:43] you're never i'll tell you what may god
[2:09:45] give me the strength to be able to raise
[2:09:47] up my hands
[2:09:48] the longest day i live on the earth i
[2:09:50] don't ever want to be stoved up in such
[2:09:52] a way that i can't raise up my hands i
[2:09:54] know my heart would praise him anyway
[2:09:56] i know my spirit would praise him anyway
[2:09:58] but i want to be able to lift
[2:10:00] up my hands over my head and tell god i
[2:10:03] realize i live and breathe and move
[2:10:05] because of who you are it is not because
[2:10:08] of who i am that i get by
[2:10:10] it is because of who you are and you
[2:10:12] start doing that a little while
[2:10:13] i want to know does anybody else believe
[2:10:15] that has helped you is that a key in
[2:10:16] your life
[2:10:17] well those of you that don't think
[2:10:19] that's a key in your life maybe it's
[2:10:20] because you don't try it
[2:10:23] well i just can't hardly do some such a
[2:10:25] thing as that that's just not my nature
[2:10:27] nobody is talking to you about your
[2:10:29] nature
[2:10:30] your nature is what needs to die we're
[2:10:32] talking to you about a way to get out of
[2:10:34] the grubs
[2:10:35] we're talking to you about a way to get
[2:10:37] out of depression about a way to get out
[2:10:39] of condemnation
[2:10:40] about a way to get out from under the
[2:10:41] enemy's accusation about a way to deal
[2:10:44] with frustration
[2:10:45] is praise the lord praise the lord
[2:10:49] with a loud voice
[2:10:52] somebody said i don't have one use the
[2:10:54] one you got
[2:10:56] and praise him let everything that hath
[2:10:58] breath
[2:11:00] praise the lord praise him i don't
[2:11:02] believe in the drums i don't care what
[2:11:04] you believe in
[2:11:06] david believed in the drums david said
[2:11:09] praise the lord
[2:11:10] on the high sounding symbols
[2:11:14] he said praise him with sultry and harp
[2:11:18] he said praise him in the dance what
[2:11:21] about that
[2:11:23] somebody said if you believe the real
[2:11:25] message of the hour you'd put
[2:11:26] all that away you are way too late to
[2:11:29] tell me
[2:11:31] that i don't have a right and a reason
[2:11:35] and a compelling uh unction to give god
[2:11:38] praise
[2:11:40] amen i don't believe in all that
[2:11:42] twirling around and moving around
[2:11:44] and moving your body well listen you
[2:11:46] don't have to believe in it
[2:11:48] but i want you to know the bible said
[2:11:50] that's the way we come in praise
[2:11:52] we stand to praise we we lay prostrate
[2:11:55] on the floor to praise
[2:11:56] the bible tells us how to praise and how
[2:11:58] god looks at praise
[2:11:59] and i know that praise will bring the
[2:12:01] joy back
[2:12:03] he said people don't believe in shouting
[2:12:05] the thing of it is they don't have any
[2:12:06] spiritual joy
[2:12:07] and the joys of the waters of life can
[2:12:10] flow through
[2:12:11] we need that he said there's a whole lot
[2:12:14] is the matter that's a whole lot is the
[2:12:16] matter
[2:12:16] with the branham tabernacle because that
[2:12:19] unbelief
[2:12:21] the cares of the world had bound the
[2:12:24] people
[2:12:25] until it cannot produce spiritual growth
[2:12:29] it wouldn't be right for me to quote
[2:12:30] that about another church
[2:12:34] [Music]
[2:12:36] and not quoted about my own so there's a
[2:12:39] whole lot wrong with the new hope
[2:12:40] revival ministries
[2:12:43] and it's because of unbelief the cares
[2:12:47] of the world has bound the people
[2:12:49] until it cannot produce spiritual growth
[2:12:52] somebody said you're not going to whip
[2:12:53] us this morning are you no no no
[2:12:55] i'm just going to tell you we can't
[2:12:57] delight in somebody else's shortcoming
[2:12:59] and not recognize the fact
[2:13:00] we can easily get in the very same spot
[2:13:02] you can lose your joy
[2:13:05] the enemy is after your joy he's after
[2:13:09] your liberty
[2:13:10] and your freedom to praise god so you've
[2:13:12] got to make he said that's what's the
[2:13:13] matter with our nation
[2:13:15] we ought to listen to a voice like this
[2:13:18] he said that's what's the matter with
[2:13:19] our nation
[2:13:20] that's the matter with our churches he
[2:13:22] said they have no joy
[2:13:24] and the joy of the lord has departed
[2:13:26] come back
[2:13:27] joy of the lord come back freedom
[2:13:32] come back liberty that's what the holy
[2:13:34] ghost will bring when he comes
[2:13:36] i'm not talking about foolishness i'm
[2:13:38] talking about true
[2:13:40] dedicated worship and praise he said as
[2:13:43] was written once in the scripture the
[2:13:44] hebrew word ichabod which means the
[2:13:46] presence of the glory of the lord hath
[2:13:48] departed he said that's over our
[2:13:50] churches because we've left off the
[2:13:51] original foundation
[2:13:53] and placed ourselves into creeds and
[2:13:54] denomination and permitted the things of
[2:13:56] the world
[2:13:57] to dry up we've permitted the things of
[2:14:00] the world
[2:14:01] to dry up our experience with god
[2:14:04] help us lord would you help me say it
[2:14:07] help us lord
[2:14:09] this is not who we want to be we want to
[2:14:12] have it
[2:14:13] now the little second portion of this
[2:14:18] the bible said he would come and reprove
[2:14:20] the world of righteousness
[2:14:23] of sin of unbelief he would help the
[2:14:26] people to see your living and unbelief
[2:14:28] and you don't have to live in unbelief
[2:14:30] you can live in faith
[2:14:32] that's the work of the holy spirit
[2:14:34] people will go right on in their life
[2:14:36] doing what they want to do living the
[2:14:37] life they want to live
[2:14:38] until the holy spirit starts dealing
[2:14:40] with them that's how you came to him
[2:14:42] that's how you came to him he started
[2:14:44] knocking on your door he started tugging
[2:14:46] at your heart
[2:14:47] letting you know you're without god the
[2:14:50] reason why you feel the way you do is
[2:14:51] there's a higher way
[2:14:52] you're being called to live something
[2:14:53] else you you've got sin in your life
[2:14:57] you've got unbelief in your heart and
[2:14:59] god starts dealing with us that way
[2:15:02] and i thank him that he does but then he
[2:15:04] said
[2:15:05] when when he comes he will reprove
[2:15:08] which is to convict and convince he will
[2:15:11] reprove the world of righteousness
[2:15:17] he said of righteousness because i go to
[2:15:19] my father and you see me no more
[2:15:21] well you know that's an odd odd
[2:15:23] statement by our lord
[2:15:25] you look at that word righteous it it
[2:15:27] just simply means upright
[2:15:30] you get turned upside down in your own
[2:15:32] ways
[2:15:34] god wants to come and set you right back
[2:15:36] up upright again
[2:15:38] it means uh an acceptable condition
[2:15:41] before god of integrity and
[2:15:43] virtue and purity of life it means
[2:15:46] rightness it means correctness of
[2:15:48] thinking it means
[2:15:50] correctness of feeling it means
[2:15:52] correctness of acting
[2:15:54] meaning how we behave and yet isaiah 64
[2:15:59] 6 says but we
[2:16:00] are all as an unclean thing and
[2:16:04] all our righteousness or all of our
[2:16:07] righteousnesses
[2:16:09] are as filthy rags and we do
[2:16:12] all fade as a leaf and our iniquities
[2:16:17] like the wind
[2:16:19] have taken us away
[2:16:22] what do you do when the god you want to
[2:16:24] please
[2:16:26] looks at you and says all of your
[2:16:29] righteousnesses
[2:16:31] are just dirty rags
[2:16:37] you mean i'm trying to please you and
[2:16:40] yet all my
[2:16:41] everything i do all my efforts
[2:16:44] appear before your holiness
[2:16:48] as just dirty rags and god says yes
[2:16:53] well that could be a little depressing
[2:16:55] that could be a little discouraging
[2:16:58] until we receive the revelation that it
[2:17:01] is not our righteousness
[2:17:03] that he is after come on
[2:17:07] if you can wake up just a few more
[2:17:09] minutes please do
[2:17:11] because it's very very liberating
[2:17:14] to find out that when you do the best
[2:17:17] you can do
[2:17:22] i think about so many different faiths
[2:17:27] i think about those who live the plain
[2:17:30] life
[2:17:33] it came up in the prayer last night when
[2:17:34] the spirit of the lord was leading our
[2:17:36] prayer
[2:17:39] benjamin mentioned it to me this morning
[2:17:40] when we got here
[2:17:43] he said that i can't help but think
[2:17:45] about the fact
[2:17:46] that as you were praying last night
[2:17:48] there are so many around the world
[2:17:50] in many in other faiths many faiths not
[2:17:52] just one or two
[2:17:54] movements who do all they can
[2:17:58] to be right
[2:18:02] right down to the window shade to be
[2:18:05] right
[2:18:08] and at the end of all of that
[2:18:12] even living without an electric bulb
[2:18:16] or whatever else is required
[2:18:19] to be right we want to be right with our
[2:18:22] community
[2:18:24] we want to be right with our bishop our
[2:18:25] pastor we want to be right with god
[2:18:29] so we do everything that we know to do
[2:18:31] and everything we're told to do and
[2:18:32] everything we think we should do
[2:18:35] and at the end of that to be told
[2:18:38] you still don't know
[2:18:43] that you're saved when will i know
[2:18:46] when you die
[2:18:50] then you'll know there is something in
[2:18:53] me that screams
[2:18:55] when i think of that there's something
[2:18:57] in me that says
[2:18:58] no that could not be the will of god
[2:19:04] it could not be the word of god it could
[2:19:07] not
[2:19:08] be the will of god for man to do all
[2:19:10] that he knows to do
[2:19:12] and still not have assurance
[2:19:17] that he's been born again
[2:19:20] it just could not be right so we
[2:19:23] pray for those who may be under such an
[2:19:27] idea
[2:19:29] that they would call on the lord for
[2:19:31] themselves
[2:19:32] that he would reveal himself as he has
[2:19:36] to some of those we know made himself
[2:19:40] real by putting a hunger in their heart
[2:19:43] that's how he does it it's a work of the
[2:19:45] holy spirit
[2:19:47] it's the work of the holy spirit before
[2:19:48] you're even baptized with the holy
[2:19:50] spirit
[2:19:51] he's still working for you as a child of
[2:19:53] god and he was working in my life before
[2:19:56] i surrendered he was working in your
[2:19:58] life
[2:19:58] before you surrendered that's why you
[2:20:00] surrendered
[2:20:02] because you thought you were seeking him
[2:20:04] and re
[2:20:05] in reality he was seeking you
[2:20:10] hallelujah and he draws and he deals and
[2:20:13] as the prophet said
[2:20:14] from the scripture of the devil's
[2:20:16] calling to the deep and it proves
[2:20:18] when that deeb is calling there's a deep
[2:20:20] down in you
[2:20:21] that must respond
[2:20:24] jesus doesn't want you doubting and not
[2:20:28] sure he wants to give you an assurance
[2:20:31] and the way we find that is when we
[2:20:34] recognize
[2:20:35] that on our best day
[2:20:39] i have a good day every now and again
[2:20:42] and on my best day when i do it all
[2:20:46] just right if i could hear god
[2:20:52] he would have to be true to his word and
[2:20:54] he would have to say all of that
[2:20:57] it's just filthy rags in the sight of my
[2:20:59] holiness
[2:21:01] because without my righteousness you are
[2:21:04] forever lost
[2:21:07] i tell you that makes me want to run
[2:21:09] because he
[2:21:10] he not only has required a righteousness
[2:21:14] from us
[2:21:15] but he has provided to us the
[2:21:18] righteousness that he
[2:21:19] has required i like the way brother
[2:21:22] branham talked about this
[2:21:24] in in he uses this scripture in matthew
[2:21:26] 3. let's look at it just a moment
[2:21:28] and i will hurry along
[2:21:31] matthew 3 13 then cometh jesus from
[2:21:35] galilee to jordan
[2:21:36] unto john to be baptized of him
[2:21:40] but john forbade him may remember there
[2:21:42] were cousins
[2:21:44] saying oh i have need to be baptized of
[2:21:48] thee
[2:21:49] and cometh thou to me can you see the
[2:21:51] scene
[2:21:52] jesus comes walking up to where john is
[2:21:54] baptizing and he said
[2:21:56] i need to be baptized i need you to
[2:21:58] baptize me
[2:22:01] john is just blown away no i don't think
[2:22:04] i don't think you need me to baptize you
[2:22:06] i think
[2:22:08] i need you to baptize me
[2:22:11] and jesus said unto him suffer it to be
[2:22:15] so now
[2:22:16] for thus it becometh us
[2:22:24] to fulfill all righteousness
[2:22:28] then he suffered him that's a powerful
[2:22:32] phrase
[2:22:33] the prophet preached a whole sermon with
[2:22:35] the title
[2:22:37] it's a powerful concept for thus it
[2:22:40] becometh us
[2:22:42] to fulfill all righteousness
[2:22:48] the prophet says some things here that
[2:22:50] are very interesting
[2:22:52] because he speaks of the need of jesus
[2:22:55] christ
[2:22:56] to be baptized with the holy ghost
[2:22:59] so i mean he said i just don't
[2:23:01] understand that he was the spirit of god
[2:23:04] but there was a requirement a righteous
[2:23:07] requirement
[2:23:08] that had to be met the sacrifice
[2:23:12] had to be washed
[2:23:15] the sacrifice had to be washed
[2:23:18] and that day the sacrifice would not be
[2:23:22] a lamb
[2:23:22] it wouldn't be a bullock it wouldn't be
[2:23:25] a turtle dove
[2:23:26] that day there would be an ultimate
[2:23:28] sacrifice made
[2:23:29] at calvary one of the lamb of god
[2:23:34] that john identified by revelation is
[2:23:36] the one that cometh to take away the
[2:23:38] sins of the world
[2:23:40] here stood the lamb can't you hear john
[2:23:43] cry
[2:23:43] behold the lamb of god which taketh away
[2:23:46] the sins of the world
[2:23:48] that lamb was going to be a sacrifice
[2:23:50] and when he would become that sacrifice
[2:23:53] it would finish the need
[2:23:56] it would finish the requirement for
[2:23:59] sacrifice
[2:24:01] because he would become the sacrifice
[2:24:04] and in order
[2:24:05] to go to to death and shed blood
[2:24:08] and be the sacrifice that the eternal
[2:24:11] spirit of the father desired for him to
[2:24:12] be
[2:24:13] he had to fulfill the requirement of
[2:24:15] every other sacrifice that had been
[2:24:16] offered as an offering unto the lord
[2:24:18] in the holy temple in the tabernacle all
[2:24:21] through god's economy with man
[2:24:23] and that was he had to be washed so
[2:24:26] jesus is saying to john
[2:24:28] it behooves us both we must fulfill all
[2:24:30] righteousness
[2:24:31] i am here because we are fulfilling the
[2:24:34] righteous requirement
[2:24:36] of the eternal spirit of god if you are
[2:24:38] not doing your part and i'm not doing
[2:24:40] my part then we're not fulfilling
[2:24:42] everything that is required
[2:24:45] and so not only did he have to be washed
[2:24:47] in water
[2:24:48] but he also needed to be filled
[2:24:51] to be baptized brother said with the
[2:24:54] holy ghost
[2:24:55] just like every other believer because
[2:24:58] though he were a son yet he learned
[2:25:01] all things he learned everything by what
[2:25:03] he suffered
[2:25:04] and though he had started the adoption
[2:25:07] process
[2:25:08] on the mount of transfiguration when the
[2:25:11] voice said this is my beloved son
[2:25:14] it was not until he had gone we know
[2:25:16] that he had to have both he had to have
[2:25:18] both the voice in the in the river
[2:25:20] and he had to have both also the voice
[2:25:22] on the
[2:25:23] mount of transfiguration at the baptism
[2:25:26] this is my beloved son
[2:25:27] in whom i am pleased to dwell is that
[2:25:29] right and on the mount of
[2:25:30] transfiguration
[2:25:31] this is my beloved son here
[2:25:35] ye him that was the adoption
[2:25:38] so even our lord had to fulfill each and
[2:25:41] every part
[2:25:42] now i want to read this to you
[2:25:45] if you'll let me if you can stay awake
[2:25:46] long enough it becometh us to fulfill
[2:25:49] all righteousness 1961.
[2:25:51] this is so precious for me he said see
[2:25:54] aaron the high priest
[2:25:56] before he could ever be anointed he had
[2:25:58] to be washed for water
[2:25:59] therefore when jesus before he could be
[2:26:02] anointed our high priest
[2:26:04] he was washed with water and then that
[2:26:06] anointing oil poured upon him to anoint
[2:26:09] him
[2:26:09] like aaron was anointed with oil he was
[2:26:12] anointed with the holy ghost
[2:26:15] for john bare record seeing the spirit
[2:26:17] of god descending like a dove
[2:26:19] and going unto him or upon him and a
[2:26:21] voice saying
[2:26:22] this is my beloved son in whom i'm
[2:26:24] pleased to dwell in
[2:26:25] so the bible said that jesus was
[2:26:28] anointed with the holy ghost
[2:26:30] went about doing good things see
[2:26:33] he was anointed he was the anointing
[2:26:39] in a body of flesh and yet he had to be
[2:26:43] anointed
[2:26:44] to do the work of the father so even
[2:26:47] though you have the holy ghost
[2:26:49] in you as a believer you still have to
[2:26:52] function
[2:26:53] under the unction of the anointing of
[2:26:56] the holy ghost to be successful in doing
[2:26:58] the work of god
[2:26:59] so even though he's in us we still have
[2:27:01] to have fresh fresh oil
[2:27:03] fresh oil i like it pour it on my head
[2:27:05] lord do it pour it on me
[2:27:08] verse 9 of paragraph 90 and before he
[2:27:10] was anointed he had to fulfill all
[2:27:12] righteousness
[2:27:13] he had to be washed with water before
[2:27:15] the anointing could come upon him
[2:27:16] it's a very beautiful type of us today
[2:27:18] as priest unto god
[2:27:19] we must be first baptized confess our
[2:27:22] sins be baptized
[2:27:23] in the name of jesus christ washing away
[2:27:25] our sins and then you shall receive the
[2:27:27] anointing
[2:27:27] the gift of the holy ghost see washed
[2:27:30] first
[2:27:31] and then anointed for service
[2:27:35] i'm going to skip down just a bit he
[2:27:36] said that's where the holy ghost fell
[2:27:38] and anointed first
[2:27:39] so a minister or any believer must first
[2:27:41] be washed from his sins
[2:27:43] in the name of jesus christ and then
[2:27:45] anointed with the holy ghost
[2:27:47] to bring forth a testimony for god how
[2:27:49] many of you want it both
[2:27:51] you want to be filled with the holy
[2:27:52] ghost and you want to be anointed by the
[2:27:54] power and
[2:27:55] unction of the holy ghost one more
[2:27:57] quotation here elisha the prophet
[2:27:59] 56. i know this is a lot of reading but
[2:28:02] i can't help it i can't help myself
[2:28:05] it's rich to me he said now a double
[2:28:08] portion of elijah's spirit came on
[2:28:09] elisha
[2:28:10] and he done twice the miracles that
[2:28:12] elijah did and a double portion of the
[2:28:14] holy spirit now i want you to notice
[2:28:16] elijah had a robe
[2:28:18] as a symbol he's talking about the
[2:28:20] mantle
[2:28:22] he said a robe was what he was wrapped
[2:28:24] in
[2:28:25] and it was a symbol of the holy spirit
[2:28:28] and he went up he watched and the robe
[2:28:30] fell back from the chariot
[2:28:32] remember the story in kings he picked up
[2:28:35] the robe
[2:28:36] he laid it on his own shoulders he went
[2:28:38] down to jordan
[2:28:39] and started doing the miracles and jesus
[2:28:43] the baptism that he had was the baptism
[2:28:45] of the holy spirit which was in him
[2:28:47] that came on him at the river jordan
[2:28:49] after he was baptized in water
[2:28:51] do you understand that even our lord
[2:28:54] jesus christ
[2:28:55] word in flesh
[2:28:58] even his own mother chosen of god highly
[2:29:00] favored of god to carry
[2:29:02] and yet they both had to receive the
[2:29:05] baptism of the holy ghost so please
[2:29:07] don't tell me
[2:29:08] just just nudge your neighbor just a
[2:29:10] minute
[2:29:11] let them wake up if you hear them
[2:29:13] snoring especially
[2:29:15] please don't tell me that we have come
[2:29:18] to a place now
[2:29:20] where we don't need the baptism of the
[2:29:21] holy ghost
[2:29:24] please don't try to say something like
[2:29:25] that we need him
[2:29:27] i need him i need him i want you to say
[2:29:29] with me i need him
[2:29:31] and not only do i need the baptism of
[2:29:33] the holy ghost i need that fresh oil
[2:29:36] to be poured over my head and again
[2:29:40] if you want an anointing over your life
[2:29:42] there's one way to create an atmosphere
[2:29:44] for that anointing to fall on you and
[2:29:47] that is with your praise
[2:29:49] i want you to know it's important
[2:29:52] it's not just setting the mood for the
[2:29:54] preaching
[2:29:56] it's creating an atmosphere for oil to
[2:29:59] fall on your head lord i ask you right
[2:30:01] now
[2:30:01] in the mighty name of jesus said before
[2:30:03] we leave this place you will let fresh
[2:30:05] oil fall on our heads
[2:30:06] he will because we believe him to do so
[2:30:10] we believe him for an anointing he said
[2:30:16] and that baptism was of the holy spirit
[2:30:19] which was in him that come on him at the
[2:30:21] river jordan
[2:30:22] after he was baptized in water john bare
[2:30:24] records seeing the spirit of god like a
[2:30:25] dove coming upon him
[2:30:27] and notice then when he went up he sent
[2:30:29] back the same robe
[2:30:31] mantle that he was wrapped in the holy
[2:30:33] ghost upon the church
[2:30:36] he said and now people that believe in
[2:30:37] the baptism of the holy spirit they're
[2:30:38] afraid to take divine healing
[2:30:40] he said afraid to declare yourself a
[2:30:42] member or an associate among these
[2:30:44] believers
[2:30:45] why you should be ashamed he said to be
[2:30:47] the greatest honor to know that i have
[2:30:49] been wrapped
[2:30:50] in the righteousness of the lord jesus
[2:30:54] christ
[2:30:55] and he seemed fit to do that for me
[2:30:58] [Music]
[2:30:59] lord i don't mind you telling me that
[2:31:02] all my righteousness
[2:31:03] is just filthy rags when you are
[2:31:05] offering to wrap me in the robe
[2:31:09] of your righteousness hallelujah your
[2:31:14] uprightness
[2:31:16] your ability to think right speak right
[2:31:19] and do right that's his ability and he
[2:31:22] wants to wrap you in that
[2:31:23] oh hallelujah he wants to wrap
[2:31:26] us in his righteousness
[2:31:30] whoo okay i'm not offended
[2:31:33] by him telling me that mine is not
[2:31:35] enough as long as he's making a way
[2:31:38] for me to have what is enough second
[2:31:41] corinthians 5
[2:31:42] 21 let's put that up on the board ii
[2:31:44] corinthians 5 21
[2:31:46] for he hath made him
[2:31:50] father hath made son to be sin
[2:31:53] for us ii corinthians 5 verse 21
[2:31:58] for he hath made him to be sin
[2:32:01] for us who knew
[2:32:04] no sin the son
[2:32:08] word in flesh that we might be made
[2:32:13] the righteousness of god in him
[2:32:18] that word made here is a powerful word
[2:32:20] do you know what it means in
[2:32:22] in the original it means to be married
[2:32:24] to
[2:32:26] when i think of the word made i think of
[2:32:28] you know something you made
[2:32:30] something you crafted with your own
[2:32:31] hands but the real meaning of this word
[2:32:34] that's translated in english you're made
[2:32:36] is to be married to and he hath married
[2:32:40] him to sin for us
[2:32:45] the father hath joined him remember he
[2:32:47] had no sin of his own
[2:32:49] and yet all my sin was put on him
[2:32:52] and he was made fashioned married to
[2:32:55] joined to
[2:32:56] all of our sin all of our sin he bore it
[2:33:00] all
[2:33:01] all of our sin had to fall on the lamb
[2:33:03] it all had to be placed on the head of
[2:33:04] the lamb every bit of it had to be on
[2:33:06] him
[2:33:07] that we might be made married to
[2:33:10] the righteousness of god in him
[2:33:13] hallelujah
[2:33:14] did you know that god has married you to
[2:33:16] his righteousness
[2:33:19] when he sees you he sees his
[2:33:21] righteousness
[2:33:22] when he sees you he sees the blood
[2:33:24] that's why you must walk in the spirit
[2:33:26] you must choose every day of your life
[2:33:29] to walk in the spirit because if you're
[2:33:32] not walking in the spirit
[2:33:33] you will not enjoy the benefits of the
[2:33:36] spirit life
[2:33:37] and one of the benefits of the spirit
[2:33:39] life is to be wrapped
[2:33:42] in the righteousness of god i tell you
[2:33:45] that'll deal with the devil for you
[2:33:48] you just go meet the devil wrapped in
[2:33:49] the righteousness of god
[2:33:52] the accuser will have little to say to
[2:33:54] you
[2:33:55] if you are always wrapped up in the
[2:33:58] righteousness of god
[2:33:59] in him i'm happy i'm happy
[2:34:02] look at titus 3 5.
[2:34:07] not by works
[2:34:12] of righteousness which we have done
[2:34:16] i'll give them just a minute pardon me
[2:34:20] titus 3 5.
[2:34:26] not by works of righteousness which we
[2:34:30] have done
[2:34:32] but according to
[2:34:35] his mercy he saved us
[2:34:41] do you know why mercy was required
[2:34:45] do you know why he saved us
[2:34:51] because of mercy do you know what role
[2:34:54] mercy played
[2:34:55] in our salvation there was a righteous
[2:34:59] judgment that had to be met
[2:35:02] and mercy stood between us and the grace
[2:35:04] of god
[2:35:06] mercy bridged the gap
[2:35:10] we didn't get what we deserved mercy
[2:35:13] stepped in
[2:35:15] to make sure that we didn't receive the
[2:35:17] penalty that we had earned
[2:35:20] which was death and eternal separation
[2:35:21] from god
[2:35:23] mercy was a bridge it built a bridge
[2:35:26] between what god
[2:35:28] required and what we could offer
[2:35:31] mercy become the bridge so that grace
[2:35:34] could reach us
[2:35:36] grace became the vehicle to bring us the
[2:35:39] blood
[2:35:40] so we needed both mercy and grace
[2:35:43] to come to salvation and yet mercy and
[2:35:47] grace could not pay the ultimate price
[2:35:49] it could only make available to us what
[2:35:52] we needed
[2:35:54] it could bring us to the place of being
[2:35:56] accepted
[2:35:57] but a price had to be paid and how many
[2:36:00] of you know what the price was
[2:36:02] the price was not mercy the price was
[2:36:04] not grace
[2:36:06] the price was the blood
[2:36:11] so when you hear the prophet say you're
[2:36:12] not saved by the blood you're saved by
[2:36:13] grace
[2:36:14] please understand what he was teaching
[2:36:16] us in the scripture
[2:36:18] grace without the blood is not enough
[2:36:21] the blood without grace to get it to us
[2:36:23] is not enough
[2:36:24] so mercy is what came and bridged the
[2:36:26] gap so that we could receive grace
[2:36:28] and grace is what delivered the blood to
[2:36:31] us
[2:36:33] i'm so thankful i'm so thankful i'm so
[2:36:35] thankful
[2:36:37] i'm so thankful not by works of
[2:36:39] righteousness which we have done
[2:36:41] but according to his mercy he saved us
[2:36:43] look at the rest of this verse
[2:36:44] by the washing of regeneration
[2:36:48] and renewing of the holy ghost
[2:36:52] that word regeneration speaks of the new
[2:36:54] birth it speaks of renewal it speaks of
[2:36:56] recreation
[2:36:59] it speaks of a total renovation
[2:37:02] and that word renewing speaks of a
[2:37:04] complete change for the better
[2:37:07] when you receive the baptism of the holy
[2:37:09] ghost i'm telling you right now
[2:37:11] you receive a complete change for the
[2:37:13] better
[2:37:14] you can't please god without
[2:37:18] the baptism of the holy ghost now that's
[2:37:20] a hard statement
[2:37:22] because your new birth is not complete
[2:37:25] until life comes not your natural born
[2:37:29] life
[2:37:30] but his life zoe life
[2:37:34] the life of god the life of christ how
[2:37:36] many of you are glad you know who you
[2:37:38] are
[2:37:40] and one more verse of scripture
[2:37:41] ephesians 2 11 lest someone would hear
[2:37:43] this and say you spent more time quoting
[2:37:45] brother branham than you did reading the
[2:37:46] scripture oh i got lots of scripture to
[2:37:48] read
[2:37:50] ephesians 2 11 in whom also
[2:37:54] in whom also we have obtained an
[2:37:58] inheritance
[2:38:00] hallelujah my name was in the will
[2:38:06] and i have received an inheritance
[2:38:10] being pre-destinated
[2:38:13] according to the purpose of him who
[2:38:16] worketh
[2:38:18] all things
[2:38:22] after the council i'm reading ephesians
[2:38:24] 2 11.
[2:38:26] i did i'm
[2:38:29] can i have 111 quit grinning
[2:38:34] she's grinning cause it's on me this
[2:38:37] time
[2:38:38] forgive me
[2:38:42] maybe we ought to read 2 11 too we can
[2:38:44] make it spiritual but no 111 i'm so
[2:38:46] sorry
[2:38:47] in whom also we have obtained an
[2:38:50] inheritance
[2:38:52] being predestinated according to the
[2:38:54] purpose of him
[2:38:55] who worketh all things
[2:38:58] after the counsel of his own will do you
[2:39:01] know what part of that inheritance is
[2:39:03] his righteousness i have his
[2:39:05] righteousness
[2:39:06] as part of my inheritance in him how did
[2:39:10] i get an inheritance
[2:39:11] because my name was in the will how did
[2:39:14] that will
[2:39:15] get to be a part of my life the testator
[2:39:17] had to die
[2:39:18] hallelujah he had to die and when he
[2:39:21] died everything
[2:39:22] that was a part of him it was then made
[2:39:25] available
[2:39:26] his whole estate became available to the
[2:39:29] believer
[2:39:30] didn't the prophet tell us all that was
[2:39:32] in the father he poured into the sun
[2:39:34] and all that was in the sun he poured
[2:39:35] into the church
[2:39:37] on the day of pentecost by the power of
[2:39:39] the holy ghost
[2:39:40] we have an inheritance that
[2:39:44] moths cannot corrupt and thieves cannot
[2:39:47] break through and steal
[2:39:48] floods can't drown it and fires can't
[2:39:51] burn it it is an eternal
[2:39:53] inheritance we didn't earn it
[2:39:57] we just accepted it and how did we
[2:40:00] accept it with a carnal understanding no
[2:40:04] by faith by faith
[2:40:08] did you hear my amen in me by
[2:40:11] faith he said no it's by faith
[2:40:15] thank you lord somebody said i don't
[2:40:17] have faith you do
[2:40:20] you were given a measure of faith when
[2:40:22] you come here and if you use what faith
[2:40:24] you have
[2:40:25] your faith will grow and you won't have
[2:40:27] any
[2:40:28] problem walking up and saying i have an
[2:40:31] inheritance coming
[2:40:32] now i know that there are many who are
[2:40:34] taught that that kind of assurance is
[2:40:35] pride
[2:40:36] i want you to know it is not pride to
[2:40:38] take god at his word
[2:40:40] it's pride to think you can earn it it's
[2:40:43] pride for a woman to think she could
[2:40:45] earn it by by making her skirt even
[2:40:47] longer or making this or that or the
[2:40:49] other you can't earn it that way
[2:40:51] even modesty is a requirement for a new
[2:40:54] testament believer but it is not how we
[2:40:56] become righteous
[2:40:59] i'm going to tell you something i
[2:41:00] believe attendance in in meetings
[2:41:02] meeting the saints and coming together i
[2:41:04] believe it's essential
[2:41:06] but that's not where our righteousness
[2:41:07] lays i believe in paying tithe
[2:41:10] i know there's a lot of people who
[2:41:12] believe that it seems to be such an old
[2:41:13] testament concept
[2:41:14] that they don't want any part of giving
[2:41:16] what belongs to god to god
[2:41:18] and i say that's okay let's do it the
[2:41:19] new testament way
[2:41:22] if you want to if you want to argue
[2:41:23] about giving god a tenth of your
[2:41:25] what he puts in your hands then let's do
[2:41:27] it like they did in the book of acts
[2:41:28] where they sold everything they had and
[2:41:30] brought it all and laid it at the
[2:41:31] apostles feet
[2:41:33] so it's 10 or 100 percent i think most
[2:41:36] people would rather come and bring god
[2:41:37] whatever they can give him
[2:41:40] oh it's quiet i wasn't taking an
[2:41:42] offering
[2:41:44] i'm just telling you don't you don't you
[2:41:45] argue and grumble
[2:41:47] over something like that be thankful
[2:41:49] that you have an opportunity to sow a
[2:41:51] seed
[2:41:51] for the work of the lord to go on
[2:41:54] somebody out there's got to hear what
[2:41:55] you know
[2:41:57] you know something that somebody's got
[2:41:59] to hear
[2:42:01] and you've got to help get it to him
[2:42:04] i'll tell you he told us the
[2:42:05] greatest commission is to go if you
[2:42:07] can't go send
[2:42:09] somebody and did you know you're doing
[2:42:11] that
[2:42:12] i'm not trying to be cheesy did you know
[2:42:14] you're doing that right now
[2:42:18] you're sending somebody you're pulling
[2:42:21] in this service and an amen that you can
[2:42:23] squeeze out
[2:42:24] and keeping your mind here and helping
[2:42:26] an anointing to continue to flow
[2:42:28] you're helping to reach somebody
[2:42:31] who needs to be reached in that message
[2:42:33] who is this melchizedek brother branham
[2:42:35] calls righteousness because remember
[2:42:37] he said he was a dual king he was both
[2:42:39] the king of peace and the king of
[2:42:41] righteousness
[2:42:41] and he talks talks about righteousness
[2:42:43] there and he calls it the spirit
[2:42:45] attribute he said righteousness
[2:42:48] is the spirit attribute it's not man's
[2:42:51] attribute
[2:42:53] it's not the believer's attribute it's
[2:42:54] what happens when the spirit comes
[2:42:56] he brings the righteousness of god
[2:42:58] romans 1 17
[2:43:00] for therein is the righteousness of god
[2:43:03] revealed
[2:43:05] from faith to faith as it is written
[2:43:08] the just shall live by faith isaiah 61
[2:43:12] and 10
[2:43:12] i will greatly rejoice in the lord my
[2:43:15] soul shall be joyful in my god
[2:43:17] for he hath clothed me with the garments
[2:43:19] of salvation
[2:43:20] he hath covered me with the robe of
[2:43:23] righteousness as a bridegroom decath
[2:43:25] himself with ornaments and as a bride
[2:43:26] adorneth herself with jewels
[2:43:28] can you say amen ephesians 4 24 you
[2:43:31] wanted scripture
[2:43:35] ephesians 4 24 and that you put on the
[2:43:37] new man
[2:43:39] which after god is created in
[2:43:42] righteousness
[2:43:43] and true holiness it
[2:43:47] is a gift
[2:43:50] another little piece from the church
[2:43:52] ages he's quoting ephesians 4 24 that i
[2:43:55] just read
[2:43:56] he said it and that you put on the new
[2:43:57] man which after god is created in
[2:43:59] righteousness and true holiness
[2:44:01] listen to this the new creation
[2:44:04] you are now a new creation do you
[2:44:06] understand that
[2:44:07] how many of you understand if you know
[2:44:09] you're a new creation i want to see your
[2:44:10] hand
[2:44:11] you know what new means it means new
[2:44:14] it means new when brother branham talks
[2:44:18] about the redeem being a race
[2:44:21] a chosen race of people he wasn't using
[2:44:23] that word wrong
[2:44:25] he used that word right he was telling
[2:44:28] us
[2:44:29] that we are recreated
[2:44:32] there's only a small representation of
[2:44:34] what we have been
[2:44:36] that remains in us because we are not
[2:44:39] maybe the natural born seed of abraham
[2:44:42] but by the new birth we are the royal
[2:44:44] sea
[2:44:45] of abraham if you're with me then you
[2:44:46] can say amen
[2:44:48] and so he goes on to describe this new
[2:44:50] creation that we are
[2:44:51] yeah i like this i like this this new
[2:44:54] creation is not the old creation made
[2:44:58] over
[2:45:00] brother richard ellsworth brother
[2:45:04] michael christian robert who else
[2:45:08] all of you every one of you i'm just
[2:45:10] calling names so you'll know i know your
[2:45:12] name
[2:45:14] every one of you you are not just a
[2:45:17] remodeled
[2:45:18] creation he didn't just send his blood
[2:45:22] and remodel you he said this
[2:45:26] new creation is not the old creation
[2:45:28] made over
[2:45:30] this isn't remodeling a home no
[2:45:33] no no he said or it could not be called
[2:45:36] a new creation
[2:45:38] this is exactly what it says it is
[2:45:42] new creation it is another creation
[2:45:47] distinct from the old one
[2:45:52] somebody said well what in the world
[2:45:54] does that mean it means that when
[2:45:56] you are born again of the spirit of
[2:45:57] christ you are not just
[2:45:59] an old sinner
[2:46:02] saved by grace
[2:46:07] are you really going to say that i just
[2:46:08] did
[2:46:10] there's some beautiful songs out there
[2:46:12] and i know even brother brandon makes
[2:46:13] statements like that
[2:46:14] beautiful songs and beautiful though i'm
[2:46:16] just a sinner
[2:46:19] say by grace it's beautiful
[2:46:24] the thought is amazing but it is not
[2:46:27] entirely congruent with scripture
[2:46:31] you're only describing one part of what
[2:46:33] god has done in your life
[2:46:35] because the bible said if you're born of
[2:46:37] god he that is born of god
[2:46:39] cannot does not
[2:46:42] commit sin so how is it that you are a
[2:46:46] sinner
[2:46:47] and saved by grace at the same time
[2:46:51] so if i'm going to sing it i'm going to
[2:46:52] sing i was a sinner
[2:46:55] but now i'm saved by grace
[2:46:59] because we understand that when we are
[2:47:01] born again of the spirit of christ
[2:47:03] we are not an old creation that's been
[2:47:05] remodeled
[2:47:06] an old man that has been made over but
[2:47:09] we
[2:47:10] now become a new creature
[2:47:13] a new creation a new man
[2:47:16] in jesus christ oh my oh my
[2:47:20] oh my old things are
[2:47:24] passed away all things
[2:47:27] have become new you are now manifesting
[2:47:30] who you were
[2:47:32] in the mind of god from before the
[2:47:34] foundations of the world
[2:47:36] this is a powerful this is a powerful
[2:47:38] demonstration
[2:47:39] of god's grace did you know that his
[2:47:42] righteousness around you like a cloak
[2:47:44] it already also becomes a part of your
[2:47:47] armor
[2:47:49] if you are wearing the righteousness of
[2:47:51] god if you have been wrapped in the
[2:47:53] righteousness of god
[2:47:54] if the holy spirit has convinced you
[2:47:57] of your need for the righteousness of
[2:48:00] god and you have
[2:48:01] surrendered to the work of the holy
[2:48:03] spirit in your life
[2:48:04] and you are now wearing that did you
[2:48:06] know it also becomes a breastplate
[2:48:09] the robe of righteousness also becomes a
[2:48:11] breastplate in the armor of the believer
[2:48:14] and when the enemy comes against you
[2:48:16] it's his righteousness
[2:48:17] that's protecting the most vulnerable
[2:48:19] parts of who you are
[2:48:22] your heart is vital got to have a heart
[2:48:26] you got to have a heart you got to have
[2:48:28] a blood pump
[2:48:30] something happens to that blood pump
[2:48:32] you're not living anymore
[2:48:34] i said to them the other night i i like
[2:48:36] to breathe
[2:48:38] i'm kind of fond of breathing i've got
[2:48:40] to have my lungs to breathe
[2:48:43] these are pretty vital organs wouldn't
[2:48:44] you say and when god was building that
[2:48:47] armor for the believer
[2:48:48] he decided that it was going to be
[2:48:50] righteousness that would become the
[2:48:52] breastplate
[2:48:52] that would protect the most vulnerable
[2:48:54] parts of who we are hallelujah
[2:48:56] and it's not your sweetheart i want you
[2:48:58] to know you're precious
[2:49:00] but that is not your righteousness that
[2:49:02] has become your breastplate
[2:49:03] if it is you're going to be in real
[2:49:04] trouble when the devil calls in the big
[2:49:06] guns
[2:49:07] when the enemy pulls in the big guns
[2:49:09] your righteousness will crumble
[2:49:11] and you'll tuck your tail and run like a
[2:49:12] little child i'm telling you right now
[2:49:14] but if you know that you know that you
[2:49:16] know that you know
[2:49:18] that you are prepared because you've
[2:49:20] been dressed in the armor of the lord
[2:49:21] and his righteousness has become your
[2:49:23] robe your cloak your anointing
[2:49:25] and it has also become your breastplate
[2:49:28] and you are fully persuaded
[2:49:29] when you meet the enemy you can stand
[2:49:31] toe to toe with the devil
[2:49:33] and any of a number of his imps
[2:49:36] and never have to bend never have to bow
[2:49:40] never have to bat an eye because you
[2:49:42] know that his righteousness is enough to
[2:49:45] meet
[2:49:45] every attack to meet every accusation
[2:49:48] can i say again
[2:49:49] the righteousness of jesus christ in
[2:49:51] your life by the work of the holy spirit
[2:49:53] is enough to meet every devil
[2:49:57] and every circumstance that tries to
[2:50:00] take you out
[2:50:02] and we're nearly done stand therefore
[2:50:05] ephesians 6 14 stand therefore having
[2:50:08] your loins gird about with truth you've
[2:50:09] got to have truth
[2:50:14] truth is a person
[2:50:17] god didn't send the revelation of this
[2:50:19] message to make us
[2:50:21] just doctrinally sound he sent this
[2:50:24] message to introduce us to jesus christ
[2:50:27] if we're holding on to brother branham
[2:50:29] and not holding on to jesus we've missed
[2:50:30] the message
[2:50:33] if we're depending on him to get us
[2:50:35] through i've got many precious friends
[2:50:38] out there who are waiting on him to
[2:50:39] return
[2:50:41] so he can help the bride get it over get
[2:50:43] over well i want you to know that's not
[2:50:45] the way it's going to work
[2:50:46] because that breaks the continuity of
[2:50:48] scripture you
[2:50:50] don't need brother branham to come and
[2:50:51] help you get ready he introduced you to
[2:50:53] jesus christ
[2:50:54] the same spirit that was in jesus christ
[2:50:56] is here to help you get over
[2:50:58] you didn't need jesus standing in a
[2:51:00] physical body to go through what they
[2:51:02] had to go through in the early church
[2:51:04] you just needed the same spirit that was
[2:51:06] in jesus to get inside of the believer
[2:51:08] and that's how they faced the enemy
[2:51:11] because they had the same spirit that
[2:51:14] raised jesus from the dead
[2:51:16] living inside of them don't get weird
[2:51:21] don't get strange you grab a hold of
[2:51:24] jesus
[2:51:25] with everything that you've got and you
[2:51:27] will not be offensive to the prophet if
[2:51:29] you should meet him one day in eternity
[2:51:30] you won't be offending him
[2:51:32] if you hold on to jesus he came like
[2:51:34] john the baptist to help
[2:51:36] introduce us to the one that would do
[2:51:37] something for us
[2:51:39] and john the baptist understood and
[2:51:41] received by revelation
[2:51:42] i must decrease so that he
[2:51:46] must increase he's got to get bigger and
[2:51:49] i got to get smaller
[2:51:50] so he can get bigger same way in your
[2:51:52] life you and i have to get smaller
[2:51:55] so jesus can get bigger in us we have to
[2:51:57] quit depending on our righteousness and
[2:51:59] start depending on him
[2:52:00] are you with me our loins gird about
[2:52:03] with truth having on the breastplate of
[2:52:04] righteousness
[2:52:05] romans 8 3 and 4 for what the law could
[2:52:08] not do
[2:52:09] in that it was weak through the flesh
[2:52:11] god sending his own son
[2:52:13] in the likeness of sinful flesh and for
[2:52:15] sin condemned sin
[2:52:17] in the flesh now let's have verse 4.
[2:52:19] romans 8 4
[2:52:20] i want you to see it
[2:52:27] that the righteousness of the law
[2:52:31] might be fulfilled in
[2:52:35] us how
[2:52:39] how do you know what the law requires
[2:52:44] the law requires a lot did you know you
[2:52:47] and i couldn't even fulfill
[2:52:49] all that is required in the law because
[2:52:50] there are no temple standing
[2:52:52] there's no sacrificial system in place
[2:52:56] there's quite a number of the of the
[2:52:58] over 600 commandments in the
[2:53:00] in the old testament that we would not
[2:53:01] be able to fulfill if we wanted to
[2:53:04] because the order is not in place to do
[2:53:05] so
[2:53:08] there are new testament christians
[2:53:10] believers who get so caught up
[2:53:13] in thinking that they have to to do
[2:53:15] everything just
[2:53:16] just like it was done and and guess
[2:53:18] what's so strange what's so what's so
[2:53:20] odd to me
[2:53:21] is they don't just go back to the
[2:53:23] scripture and try to do it according to
[2:53:24] the scripture
[2:53:25] they try to do it like modern judaism
[2:53:30] so they're they're doing so much
[2:53:32] depending on so much
[2:53:34] by the tradition of the rabbis by the
[2:53:36] tradition of the sages all these things
[2:53:37] are interesting
[2:53:41] but you've got i pray that you won't do
[2:53:43] it by the traditions because
[2:53:45] if you do it by the traditions of man
[2:53:47] you'll get drunk on purim
[2:53:51] because i've been standing in the old
[2:53:52] city of jerusalem and i have looked at
[2:53:54] the ultra-orthodox
[2:53:55] piled up like cordwood
[2:53:59] because it's purim time and it's the one
[2:54:02] day of the year they get so drunk that
[2:54:04] they don't know whether it's day or
[2:54:05] night
[2:54:06] it's the tradition to the fathers so if
[2:54:08] you and i were going to try to go back
[2:54:10] and meet god
[2:54:11] and try to figure it all out and then
[2:54:13] add to the scripture all the traditions
[2:54:15] of the rabbis
[2:54:16] and the jewish sages and those who have
[2:54:17] gone before us i want to tell you
[2:54:18] something you'd never feel like you'd
[2:54:20] done anything
[2:54:21] you'd never feel like you'd please god
[2:54:23] you'd get so confused you would get on
[2:54:25] the internet
[2:54:26] and you'd read this messianic and that
[2:54:28] messianic and the other messianic and
[2:54:30] you'd get so confused because they don't
[2:54:32] agree
[2:54:35] and i'm not saying that we shouldn't
[2:54:36] remember these things we should they're
[2:54:38] commandments
[2:54:39] there are things that should be
[2:54:40] remembered there are things that should
[2:54:41] be honored
[2:54:42] there are things that should be
[2:54:43] celebrated we're going to celebrate the
[2:54:45] feast of tabernacles all the way through
[2:54:46] the millennium
[2:54:48] there are certain things that god has
[2:54:50] has put in that word
[2:54:52] for us and we will participate and
[2:54:54] partake but
[2:54:55] i want you to know that if you kept
[2:54:58] every one of the commandments of the old
[2:54:59] testament
[2:55:00] kept them to the mark you would still
[2:55:04] fall short for the righteousness of the
[2:55:07] law
[2:55:08] might be fulfilled in us who walk
[2:55:11] not after the flesh but after the spirit
[2:55:14] let's go back to verse 3
[2:55:15] for what the law could not do in that it
[2:55:18] was weak through the flesh
[2:55:19] god sending his own son in the likeness
[2:55:22] of sinful flesh
[2:55:23] and for sin condemned sin in the flesh
[2:55:27] that the righteousness of the law might
[2:55:29] be
[2:55:30] fulfilled in us
[2:55:33] who walk not after the flesh but after
[2:55:35] the spirit how is that possible
[2:55:37] because he lives in us his righteousness
[2:55:41] is covering us
[2:55:42] look at verse 10 of the same chapter
[2:55:44] we're nearly done
[2:55:46] i can see the end in sight
[2:55:50] romans 8 10 and if christ be in you
[2:55:53] the body is dead because of sin but the
[2:55:56] spirit of life
[2:55:58] because but the spirit is life
[2:56:01] let me read it again and if christ be in
[2:56:04] you
[2:56:05] the body is dead because of sin but the
[2:56:08] spirit is life
[2:56:09] because of righteousness whose
[2:56:14] yes are you willing to let the holy
[2:56:16] spirit dress you
[2:56:18] the same holy spirit that convicts and
[2:56:20] convinces you of sin so that you can
[2:56:22] repent
[2:56:23] the same holy spirit that convinces and
[2:56:25] convicts you of little things that creep
[2:56:27] up in your life that same holy spirit
[2:56:30] desires part of his work and ministry in
[2:56:32] the end time
[2:56:33] is to dress us in the righteousness of
[2:56:35] god
[2:56:36] are you are you willing to surrender and
[2:56:38] quit struggling and striving to try to
[2:56:40] do it yourself and let him come and do
[2:56:42] it through you
[2:56:43] somebody said i think that's risky i
[2:56:45] think that's risky because i think
[2:56:46] there's some things that can be missed
[2:56:48] i want you to know there's nothing that
[2:56:50] can be missed
[2:56:51] because everything that he requires he
[2:56:54] will provide
[2:56:55] if we yield to him does that mean we
[2:56:58] have no obligation it means we have many
[2:56:59] obligations
[2:57:00] and that is to approach him by faith to
[2:57:03] repent of our sins
[2:57:04] to heed the god to follow the leadership
[2:57:07] of the holy spirit
[2:57:08] but also to let him dress us in
[2:57:10] something that we cannot produce
[2:57:11] ourselves
[2:57:12] you cannot produce the righteousness
[2:57:14] that is required
[2:57:16] it's got to be his are you with me
[2:57:19] in the church ages one other little
[2:57:21] section here i might get in trouble
[2:57:22] using so much of the church age book
[2:57:26] this is from the ephesian church he said
[2:57:29] the true church of jesus christ
[2:57:31] the bride is likened to pure gold
[2:57:36] her righteousness you read it for me
[2:57:39] would you
[2:57:41] it's his righteousness the only way she
[2:57:44] can be righteous
[2:57:47] good enough is to have his righteousness
[2:57:51] her attributes are his own glorious
[2:57:55] attributes
[2:57:57] her identity is found
[2:58:01] in him what he is
[2:58:05] she is to reflect what he has
[2:58:09] she is to manifest
[2:58:12] there is no faith no fault excuse me
[2:58:15] there is no fault in her
[2:58:21] quiet she is all glorious
[2:58:25] within and without from beginning to
[2:58:28] ending
[2:58:29] she is the work of her lord
[2:58:34] is that right and all his works are what
[2:58:40] you are his handiwork you are his craft
[2:58:45] he is making you he is molding you by
[2:58:48] the holy spirit
[2:58:49] into his image that's why you've got to
[2:58:51] have the holy ghost
[2:58:52] it's not enough to have him working from
[2:58:54] the outside in you've got to have him
[2:58:56] working from the inside out are you
[2:58:59] still
[2:59:00] here we have to close
[2:59:04] one scripture one more philippians 3 9
[2:59:07] and be found in him paul saying
[2:59:11] to be found in him not having mine own
[2:59:14] righteousness
[2:59:16] which is of the law but that which is
[2:59:18] through the faith of christ
[2:59:20] the righteousness which is of god
[2:59:24] by faith the righteousness which is of
[2:59:28] god
[2:59:29] by faith
[2:59:33] we're holy because he made us holy
[2:59:38] we're accepted because he made us
[2:59:40] accepted in the beloved
[2:59:43] we're forgiven because he forgave us
[2:59:45] before we asked
[2:59:46] we had to ask because that's our deposit
[2:59:49] of faith
[2:59:51] we had to participate in our own process
[2:59:53] of redemption
[2:59:54] but we did that not with intellect we
[2:59:56] did that by faith
[2:59:58] we said lord i believe lord i believe
[3:00:00] lord i believe that i could never
[3:00:02] be right enough lord i believe i could
[3:00:04] never do it on my own but i know you've
[3:00:05] done it and so i accept that by faith
[3:00:07] that's powerful isn't it
[3:00:09] last the last one i'm not usually still
[3:00:13] preaching
[3:00:14] at two i'm usually we're usually praying
[3:00:16] by then
[3:00:18] but philippians 3 9
[3:00:21] is is where i just read be found in him
[3:00:24] not having mine
[3:00:25] own righteousness which is of the law
[3:00:27] but that which is through the faith of
[3:00:28] christ the righteousness which is of god
[3:00:30] by faith
[3:00:31] and i want to read this one last little
[3:00:32] paragraph from satan's eden
[3:00:35] he said god's eden was established
[3:00:38] in righteousness satan's
[3:00:41] eden is established in sin because satan
[3:00:46] is sin do you know that's where we're
[3:00:48] living now
[3:00:50] we're living in satan's eden we're about
[3:00:53] to be delivered
[3:00:55] there's a deliverance coming out of
[3:00:57] satan's eden
[3:00:58] it may not be as soon as we would like
[3:01:01] but it's coming
[3:01:05] god's eden in the beginning was
[3:01:06] established in righteousness
[3:01:08] satan's eden is established in sin
[3:01:10] because satan is sin
[3:01:11] he said god is righteousness and
[3:01:14] god's kingdom was established in
[3:01:17] righteousness
[3:01:19] and peace and
[3:01:23] read it life and satan's establishment
[3:01:26] is in sin
[3:01:28] and religious sin
[3:01:31] let me tell you something you may be
[3:01:33] living in satan's eden but you're not of
[3:01:35] satan's eden
[3:01:36] you're of god's eden did you know you
[3:01:39] can live right here in the atmosphere of
[3:01:40] satan's eden
[3:01:41] and yet you are living in another
[3:01:43] kingdom altogether because you're living
[3:01:45] in
[3:01:45] in the kingdom of god in god's
[3:01:47] righteousness hallelujah
[3:01:49] no matter what's happening around would
[3:01:50] you stand i want to ask you
[3:01:52] for a little bit of mercy i i feel i
[3:01:55] feel i went way too long but
[3:01:56] would you stand with me right now and
[3:01:58] thank you thank you thank you so much
[3:02:00] musicians are coming
[3:02:01] thank you so much that you stayed with
[3:02:05] me as long as you did thank you thank
[3:02:07] you
[3:02:09] i hope you jotted the verses down the
[3:02:10] scriptures down
[3:02:12] i hope you'll read them again i hope
[3:02:14] you'll use them as ammunition against
[3:02:16] the enemy
[3:02:18] i know some of you have been waiting a
[3:02:20] long long time for the washroom and
[3:02:22] and i just thank you thank you thank you
[3:02:24] so much
[3:02:30] if we spend our life focusing
[3:02:33] on our unworthiness we'll miss his
[3:02:37] worthiness in
[3:02:38] us if we spend our life focusing on how
[3:02:42] we
[3:02:43] how far we come from measuring up
[3:02:46] we'll always walk in a bit of
[3:02:48] condemnation but if we'll just let him
[3:02:50] dress us holy spirit of god
[3:02:53] if we'll just let him dress us in his
[3:02:54] righteousness
[3:02:56] oh we thank you lord we thank you lord
[3:02:59] we thank you lord
[3:03:00] we thank you for your precious blood

[3:03:07] blood hallelujah
[3:03:09] we thank you for the way that you've
[3:03:11] made for us
[3:03:13] we thank you that the holy ghost he
[3:03:15] doesn't just come to make a shout
[3:03:17] he didn't just come to make us speak in
[3:03:19] tongues he didn't just come to make us
[3:03:21] do something like that
[3:03:23] with a sensation but thank you that he
[3:03:25] come
[3:03:26] to convince and to convict us of our
[3:03:28] unbelief
[3:03:29] thank you that he's come to dress us
[3:03:33] in the righteousness of god to show us
[3:03:35] that our righteousness would never
[3:03:37] measure up
[3:03:38] thank you that he has come to convince
[3:03:40] and to convict us of judgment
[3:03:42] to show us that the enemy who's loose
[3:03:44] now
[3:03:45] will not always be loosed he has an
[3:03:48] ultimate judgment coming
[3:03:49] he will one day uh cease to be
[3:03:52] we understand that from the word of god
[3:03:55] our enemy that torments us so now day
[3:03:57] and night
[3:03:58] one of these days will torment us no
[3:04:00] more and we will live
[3:04:02] and in eternal peace with you because
[3:04:04] you have made the way lord thank you for
[3:04:06] making the way
[3:04:07] come on church we're not leaving until
[3:04:10] we come back into an atmosphere for just
[3:04:12] a moment
[3:04:13] of praising him because he deserves
[3:04:16] all of our praise he deserves some
[3:04:20] worship before we go today
[3:04:22] just to say lord thank you for the
[3:04:23] working of the holy ghost in my life
[3:04:26] lord i realize there are some who may be
[3:04:28] watching some who may be standing here
[3:04:30] today
[3:04:31] who don't know for sure that they've
[3:04:33] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[3:04:35] i pray that a desperation would be
[3:04:38] stirred up in them even now
[3:04:41] i pray lord that there would be no
[3:04:42] satisfaction
[3:04:44] in their life they would have no real
[3:04:46] true rest
[3:04:47] until they have pressed their way in to
[3:04:50] the full
[3:04:51] baptism of the holy ghost
[3:04:55] we know that they have each one who has
[3:04:57] come to you
[3:04:58] through repentance and justification we
[3:05:00] have all been touched
[3:05:02] by the work of the holy spirit but our
[3:05:05] desire is more than just a touch
[3:05:07] our desire is to be baptized to be
[3:05:10] immersed
[3:05:10] to be totally filled up within and
[3:05:13] without
[3:05:14] of your good holy ghost hallelujah

[3:05:55] portion of satisfaction to say lord i

[3:06:00] that you have claimed me as your own

[3:17:02] i want us to pray for one another
[3:17:04] brothers and brothers and sisters and
[3:17:06] sisters
[3:17:07] we don't want to make a big to-do and
[3:17:08] have to do a lot of moving but you can
[3:17:10] move
[3:17:10] you can get near someone but i just want
[3:17:14] i would just desire that everybody would
[3:17:15] have somebody standing with them
[3:17:18] and we're going to just pray one for
[3:17:19] another just quickly you you say i don't
[3:17:21] know what the need is no but he does
[3:17:23] he does he does lord i just want to
[3:17:27] i just want to join my faith right now
[3:17:29] with with christian's faith
[3:17:32] and and i just want to believe lord that
[3:17:33] whatever he has need of just a young man
[3:17:36] but a special young man and i've already
[3:17:39] discerned lord in these two days
[3:17:42] that your hand is on him and you have a
[3:17:43] purpose for his life
[3:17:45] and we see lord that the enemy wouldn't
[3:17:48] be pleased with that
[3:17:50] he's never pleased when the when the
[3:17:52] call of god
[3:17:54] falls on a believer he doesn't like that
[3:17:56] at all
[3:17:57] but i just thank you lord for this young
[3:17:58] man's faith i pray o god
[3:18:01] that he will press into you that he will
[3:18:04] have a personal relationship with you
[3:18:06] that no devil of hell would ever be able
[3:18:08] to talk him out of
[3:18:09] i pray that his faith would go down deep
[3:18:12] and that he would strike the rock
[3:18:14] i pray lord that his faith would strike
[3:18:16] the rock of ages
[3:18:18] and that he would not be tossed about he
[3:18:20] would not be pushed about or pulled
[3:18:22] about
[3:18:22] by the influences or pulls of this life
[3:18:25] but i pray o god that he would be firmly
[3:18:27] rooted and grounded
[3:18:29] in the truth of your word and that he
[3:18:32] would stand like a mighty bulwark
[3:18:34] against every attack
[3:18:36] of the enemy now lord i don't know why
[3:18:39] but i just sense that he has at times
[3:18:41] been a target
[3:18:42] and i'm asking you lord to strengthen
[3:18:44] him
[3:18:45] in the precious name of our lord jesus
[3:18:48] christ
[3:18:49] strengthen him stir in him a desire for
[3:18:52] your word
[3:18:54] stir in him a desire for prayer
[3:18:57] stir in him a desire to be even more
[3:18:59] dedicated
[3:19:01] i'm not even looking at his age i think
[3:19:03] his age is irrelevant
[3:19:05] i think your hand on him the call of god
[3:19:08] over his life
[3:19:09] is more important than his natural age
[3:19:10] or number i'm asking you lord to fill
[3:19:13] him
[3:19:14] with the holy ghost and fire sanctify
[3:19:17] him by the washing of the water of the
[3:19:19] word
[3:19:20] and may he pursue a relationship with
[3:19:23] you that is personal that is intimate
[3:19:25] that is real may he overcome
[3:19:29] may he overcome in all things for the
[3:19:32] glory of god
[3:19:33] for the glory of god hallelujah you're
[3:19:36] just praying for the one next to you
[3:19:38] right now
[3:19:39] before we leave you're just asking for
[3:19:41] the lord's grace

[3:19:47] hallelujah thank you lord i just joined
[3:19:50] my faith lord with this little family
[3:19:52] right now

[3:19:56] the name of the lord jesus christ
[3:19:58] that they would be strengthened in every
[3:20:00] way i pray lord that they would follow
[3:20:03] you more closely than they have ever
[3:20:05] followed you before
