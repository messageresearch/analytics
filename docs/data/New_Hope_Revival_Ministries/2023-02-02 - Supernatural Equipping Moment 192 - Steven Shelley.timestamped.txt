[0:00] and not only are we a supernatural
[0:01] people but God has given us everything
[0:04] we need supernaturally to win this
[0:07] battle
[0:08] [Music]
[0:14] what will happen when we awaken that
[0:18] Supernatural power that is already in us
[0:21] we're not waiting for a place to go and
[0:24] get it we're not waiting for another
[0:27] portion of it we're waiting for
[0:29] something to awaken it within our spirit
[0:32] I want you to know I don't know anything
[0:35] better than praise to awaken what is
[0:39] dormant in your life
[0:41] I know the words the answer I know the
[0:44] word is the answer for everything but if
[0:47] you've got something dormant in your
[0:49] life connect
[0:51] to him and that's through our praise
[0:55] he's coming back for a church just like
[0:59] he births on the day of Pentecost he
[1:02] said it same power same signs same
[1:04] wonders
[1:06] same power
[1:08] same Authority this word has taken us
[1:11] right back to where he started the thing
[1:14] now we've got to catch a hold of that
[1:16] and allow God to awaken every part
[1:19] that's laying dormant in US so that we
[1:23] can step up and take our positions if
[1:25] your confession is this I'm filled with
[1:27] the Holy Ghost
[1:28] and therefore every Redemptive blessing
[1:31] of God is mine and any place where I
[1:34] have been short in the past in
[1:36] manifesting the Supernatural Armor of
[1:38] God I confess I decree I declare in the
[1:41] mighty name of Jesus that I will be
[1:44] filled and protected with love with joy
[1:46] with peace with long suffering with
[1:49] meekness with goodness with gentleness
[1:51] because that is my inheritance
[1:57] and then figuratively our Lord is
[2:00] confessing out over the heavenlies do
[2:02] you hear that
[2:04] he's filled with love he's filled with
[2:06] joy he's filled with peace
[2:09] and the angels say then let me go and
[2:11] minister to him and let me go minister
[2:13] to her and let me do what I can to help
[2:15] make sure that they're walking in the
[2:17] promise that they're confessing
[2:19] so not only do we serve a supernatural
[2:21] God we are Supernatural people
[2:24] and not only are we a supernatural
[2:26] people but God has given us everything
[2:29] we need supernaturally to win this
[2:32] battle there is a secret Rapture coming
[2:35] for the supernatural bride of Jesus
[2:38] Christ we have the gifts of the Spirit
[2:41] that are given to us as armor
[2:46] you meet the enemy with love and joy and
[2:49] peace and
[2:50] come on
[2:52] brother Branham tells us how devils are
[2:54] cast out
[2:56] they're not cast out in anger
[2:58] [Music]
[3:00] devils are cast out in love
[3:05] that's how the enemy is defeated
[3:07] it's by that armor that God has given us
[3:09] thank you Jesus for it he's given us his
[3:13] word which is the greatest weapon that
[3:14] anybody can have against the enemy and
[3:17] then thankfully God has also given us a
[3:19] five-fold Ministry to help prepare us
[3:22] to help protect us to help keep us in
[3:25] the faith because we are a supernatural
[3:27] people
