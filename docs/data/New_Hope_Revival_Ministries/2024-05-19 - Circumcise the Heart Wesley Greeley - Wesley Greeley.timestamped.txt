[39:43] limitations upon your anointing and
[39:46] there are many needs that are
[39:48] represented across the airwave through
[39:51] the internet and Lord would you visit
[39:54] your people not only here but where
[39:57] wherever they have gathered today and we
[40:00] will give you honor and glory and praise
[40:04] for it's in your mighty name We
[40:06] Believe
[40:09] hallelujah hallelujah
[40:12] hallelujah I know you've been standing
[40:14] but we're going to go to the Lord in
[40:16] prayer this morning and believe that God
[40:19] will minister to the needs if you have a
[40:22] need on your heart would you just raise
[40:23] your hand across the room God sees you
[40:27] and he sees your need and he knows and
[40:31] even if you had an opportunity to call
[40:32] it out there would be needs Among Us
[40:35] that wouldn't be called out we call them
[40:38] unspoken requests but they're requests
[40:40] nonetheless and God sees them do you
[40:43] believe that sister Shana has sent a
[40:46] note in this morning that she stands in
[40:49] need of prayer and they're going to be
[40:51] traveling this week and she needs a
[40:53] touch in her body we believe that the
[40:56] Lord has that touch
[40:57] we want to remember the prayer requests
[40:59] that we have been praying over
[41:01] Faithfully service after service we want
[41:04] to remember Jenna to the Lord today that
[41:07] God will be with her he has been and we
[41:10] know that he's going to be she's been
[41:12] laboring and uh they they speed up and
[41:16] they slow down and I don't have to
[41:17] explain that to you you folks are
[41:19] experts but she had a desire to be in
[41:22] God's house today to be in his presence
[41:26] and if you have to if if you have to
[41:27] have a little misery or whatever you
[41:29] would say there's no better place to do
[41:32] it than in the presence of the Lord we
[41:34] know that he's everywhere we understand
[41:36] that but ought to get in the presence
[41:38] when the saints are worshiping him needs
[41:41] are met do you believe that the we're so
[41:44] glad I I'm so thankful that God has
[41:48] touched little Nathan and that his
[41:50] family is in the house of God today we
[41:52] sure have missed them and especially him

[59:39] property and uh brother gy mentioned on
[59:43] Tuesday night that there would be work
[59:45] and he would get back on the time and I
[59:47] never heard anything else and so I
[59:49] didn't even know they were working until
[59:52] after lunchtime I heard that they were
[59:55] and uh Ben took a time lapse and and got
[1:00:00] part of the work that was done yesterday
[1:00:02] caught on a time lapse and they were
[1:00:04] putting up the foam board on the on the
[1:00:06] outer wall there and as I watched that I
[1:00:10] thought how in the world did they leave
[1:00:13] and not at least put up one piece of
[1:00:15] metal to see what it looked like because
[1:00:18] in my mind I'm thinking well that foam
[1:00:20] board that's that serves a purpose but
[1:00:22] it ain't very pretty you know it's just
[1:00:24] there for a reason but now not very
[1:00:26] aesthetic and I asked brother gley he
[1:00:28] usually sends me one or two pictures
[1:00:31] after the work time and I ask him for a
[1:00:33] picture and he sent it and they had put
[1:00:35] up quite a bit of metal on that on that

[1:09:28] Ed we're real glad to be in the house of
[1:09:31] the Lord to to know that he his presence
[1:09:35] is here glad to see all of you I'm just
[1:09:38] thankful for the Lord and His blessings
[1:09:40] in our life how that he guides us and he
[1:09:43] helps us uh we have read here uh
[1:09:47] concerning the the Covenant that God
[1:09:50] made with Abraham and to the seed after
[1:09:53] him and we know that
[1:09:55] the seed are those of Christ uh Christ
[1:10:00] is is the seed that was being pointed to
[1:10:04] he is the uh he is the Seed of Abraham
[1:10:08] and we are the Royal Seed of Abraham we
[1:10:12] have been blessed to be called The Royal
[1:10:14] seed and we are blessed to know our
[1:10:18] calling even as we heard uh on Tuesday
[1:10:21] night we know who we
[1:10:23] are sometimes we don't act like
[1:10:27] it but that's all
[1:10:31] acting sometimes we
[1:10:33] forget to act correctly according to who
[1:10:36] we know we are and and we get a little
[1:10:39] sidetracked but we know who we are we're
[1:10:42] the Royal Seed of
[1:10:45] Abraham and we've not possessed all that
[1:10:48] we are to possess we have a promise we
[1:10:52] have something that has been given to us
[1:10:55] that we have talked about and we have
[1:10:57] preached about for years and we have
[1:11:00] longed for and we have talked about it
[1:11:02] some more and we have we have harped on
[1:11:05] it and we have talked about it some more
[1:11:07] and yet there are things that seem
[1:11:09] almost within our grasp but not yet in
[1:11:12] our handhold and and we continue to
[1:11:16] press toward the promise of God because
[1:11:19] it is it's who we are we know who we are
[1:11:24] and we know that were the Royal Seed of
[1:11:26] Abraham and the Royal Seed of Abraham no
[1:11:30] matter what it looks like to everybody
[1:11:33] out else the promise that we have in the
[1:11:36] word that God when God looks at us
[1:11:39] because we're the Royal seed is they
[1:11:42] staggered not at the promise of God
[1:11:45] through unbelief but were strong giving
[1:11:48] praise to God yes there are times that
[1:11:52] we have those issues where that we're
[1:11:55] we're not giving praise to God but I'm
[1:11:57] thankful for the blood of the Lamb that
[1:12:00] wipes all of that out and has a
[1:12:02] different record for me he staggered not
[1:12:05] at the promise of God so today we hold
[1:12:08] on to the promise and we look to the
[1:12:10] promise and we talk about the promise
[1:12:13] because the promise is
[1:12:18] ours now we have naysayers along the way
[1:12:22] that tell us uh yeah you've been talking
[1:12:25] about that for years and and and that
[1:12:27] that person talked about it and they're
[1:12:30] gone they're dead this person talked
[1:12:32] about it and they're gone they're dead
[1:12:34] yes I know that's that's all true but
[1:12:38] let's look at the the premise of the
[1:12:41] scripture today as to what all of this
[1:12:44] is about and how God works because our
[1:12:48] biggest problem is
[1:12:52] time God is God of Eternity
[1:12:56] and the fact is I am a creature of
[1:12:59] Eternity and if you are the Royal Seed
[1:13:03] of Abraham you are a product of Eternity
[1:13:07] you are an eternal being somewhere in
[1:13:10] you there's an eternal being but we are
[1:13:13] currently locked in the confines of time
[1:13:17] right and because we are locked in the
[1:13:20] confines of time we are constantly
[1:13:23] thinking
[1:13:25] I'll be dead before that
[1:13:28] happens and quite frankly it doesn't
[1:13:32] matter because the promise is still yes
[1:13:35] and
[1:13:37] amen God's promise is still yes and it's
[1:13:40] still amen and I'm still going to fight
[1:13:43] for it as long as I have breath in my
[1:13:46] body there may be times where you're
[1:13:49] down and I'm up and there may be times
[1:13:52] where I'm down and you're up and that's
[1:13:55] why the Bible tells us to pray for one
[1:13:58] another and encourage one another and
[1:14:00] lift one another up because everybody is
[1:14:03] fighting battles and sometimes we're
[1:14:06] stronger than at other times and we
[1:14:08] don't know exactly how to handle the
[1:14:10] situation that we're in but don't you
[1:14:13] worry I may be down but I'm getting
[1:14:17] up you may be down but you're getting up
[1:14:20] because you are the Royal Seed of
[1:14:23] Abraham and you're not going to stay in
[1:14:25] your current situation forever God has
[1:14:29] given you the grace and the courage and
[1:14:31] he gives you a word into season to bring
[1:14:34] you up and out of the condition that you
[1:14:37] may be in today does so we've read here
[1:14:40] in Psalm how that God gave this promise
[1:14:43] to Abraham and then uh this part that I
[1:14:46] didn't read it talks about all that in
[1:14:48] between stuff how that Joseph uh you
[1:14:52] know Abraham he had Isaac Isaac had
[1:14:56] Jacob Jacob had these 12 sons Joseph
[1:14:59] being one of them and the promise was
[1:15:02] there all
[1:15:05] along Joseph was taken to
[1:15:10] Egypt and when Joseph was taken to Egypt
[1:15:14] it was not a pleasant journey to get to
[1:15:18] Egypt because he went to his brothers
[1:15:21] his dad asked him to go and check on his
[1:15:23] brothers check on the sheep see how
[1:15:25] things are you check on them and they
[1:15:28] they when he got there they didn't like
[1:15:30] the calling in his life they didn't like
[1:15:32] it and so they said let's just get rid
[1:15:34] of him and so Joseph ended up in Egypt
[1:15:38] they thought they were rid of the
[1:15:39] dreamer but God sent him ahead of them
[1:15:44] to preserve
[1:15:45] life now I wonder sometimes how that
[1:15:48] those 11 those 10 brothers because
[1:15:51] really Benjamin was not uh old enough to
[1:15:54] to really know but the those other
[1:15:56] brothers when those years that elapsed
[1:15:59] where they didn't know what had H
[1:16:01] happened to Joseph how many years did
[1:16:03] they have to walk in guilt and
[1:16:06] condemnation and and downheartedness
[1:16:08] knowing that they lied to their father
[1:16:10] about what had happened and they had to
[1:16:12] carry the guilt of what they'd done and
[1:16:15] all of those years of carrying that and
[1:16:18] and they they they had to live out their
[1:16:21] lives they married wives and had
[1:16:23] children and then all of the sudden the
[1:16:25] famine comes and they go down to the
[1:16:28] land of Egypt to get corn because they
[1:16:30] find out that there's plenty down there
[1:16:33] and that is when they encounter their
[1:16:35] brother once again and Joseph says uh
[1:16:38] don't be angry with
[1:16:43] yourselves God did it to preserve
[1:16:47] life and we can get angry at ourselves
[1:16:50] as we look back over some of the
[1:16:52] Shipwreck of our own lives
[1:16:56] but God has a plan that he's working
[1:16:59] out we cannot continue to live our lives
[1:17:03] in the mistakes of
[1:17:05] yesterday we cannot continue to carry
[1:17:09] the guilt and condemnation of yesterday
[1:17:12] if we have truly repented and asked the
[1:17:15] Lord Jesus to put it under the blood his
[1:17:18] blood then we cannot continue to live in
[1:17:21] that
[1:17:23] condemnation you can't fix
[1:17:26] yesterday you can't fix the last
[1:17:29] hour it's
[1:17:31] pasted but what we can do is give praise
[1:17:35] to God that he chose us that he called
[1:17:38] our name and said come up a little bit
[1:17:41] higher I've got something I want to give
[1:17:43] to you I've got something I want to show
[1:17:46] to you I've got something I want to do
[1:17:48] for you so all of these things happen
[1:17:51] and Joseph and all of these things
[1:17:53] transpire and Jacob dies and and now
[1:17:57] they go on into bondage but God gave a
[1:18:01] promise to
[1:18:03] Abraham and that promise was that there
[1:18:07] was a land to possess a land to inherit
[1:18:12] and so as Abraham passed off of the
[1:18:15] scene and he passed this down to
[1:18:19] Isaac and Isaac passed off the scene it
[1:18:22] was passed down to Jacob and as Jacob
[1:18:26] passed off the scene it's p passed down
[1:18:28] to his children and now his children are
[1:18:31] in a place of bondage where that they
[1:18:34] are under an evil Taskmaster and they
[1:18:37] are
[1:18:38] wondering where is the
[1:18:43] promise where is
[1:18:45] it I I God I I believe my father Abraham
[1:18:50] right I believe that that that the
[1:18:54] promise that was given to Abraham when
[1:18:56] it was passed down the line the wording
[1:18:59] may be a little bit different but the
[1:19:01] promise is not distorted the promise is
[1:19:04] there there is a land that is promised
[1:19:07] to us to go and possess and all of the
[1:19:10] time while they're in Egypt they're
[1:19:12] wondering what in the world are we doing
[1:19:15] here and not possessing the promise and
[1:19:18] so the time comes that God sends them a
[1:19:23] deliverer oh yeah yes sir a man that was
[1:19:27] raised in the house of pharaoh that God
[1:19:31] recognized that he had too much of Egypt
[1:19:34] in him and he had to take him to the
[1:19:36] backside of a desert for 40 years to get
[1:19:39] Egypt out of
[1:19:40] [Music]
[1:19:42] him and he didn't bring him back to
[1:19:44] Egypt to get Egypt back in him he
[1:19:47] brought him to Egypt to bring more
[1:19:49] people out of
[1:19:53] Egypt oh where I could go with that
[1:19:58] statement when Moses came back to Egypt
[1:20:01] he came with a thus sayith the Lord
[1:20:03] Pharaoh let my people
[1:20:08] go now here are these people in
[1:20:12] bondage and
[1:20:16] Pharaoh receives thus sayith the Lord
[1:20:19] let my people go and he says I will not
[1:20:23] let them go
[1:20:25] and when he says I won't let them go I I
[1:20:27] I Marvel sometimes at the scripture
[1:20:30] because that we can get so mad at
[1:20:33] Pharaoh but the fact is that the Bible
[1:20:36] said that God hardened Pharaoh's
[1:20:39] heart God did it because God has a plan
[1:20:44] in in place because if they would have
[1:20:47] left on the first round right there
[1:20:51] would they would have went without some
[1:20:53] things that were necessary for them in
[1:20:55] the
[1:20:56] wilderness and so they had to go through
[1:20:59] this this succession of of of tragedy in
[1:21:02] Egypt the the plagues that were carried
[1:21:05] out to them and and so as these plagues
[1:21:09] are coming down on the children of
[1:21:11] Israel or the children of Egypt the the
[1:21:14] plagues coming down on them one by one
[1:21:17] and God is stripping Egypt Peace by
[1:21:20] Peace by peace now all the while Israel
[1:21:24] is still in
[1:21:26] bondage they're still under evil task
[1:21:29] Masters now as these plagues go on we
[1:21:32] can see how that these taskmasters uh
[1:21:34] they they are coming to pharaoh and
[1:21:36] they're saying why don't you just let
[1:21:38] them go things are getting a little
[1:21:39] difficult for us yeah but you know we're
[1:21:42] we're seeing a little bit of this you
[1:21:44] know this is touching Our Lives we're
[1:21:46] destroyed why don't you let them go and
[1:21:49] finally God uh causes pharaoh to let the
[1:21:53] people go
[1:21:55] right the hardness was pulled off of
[1:21:58] Pharaoh's heart long
[1:22:02] enough by the death of his
[1:22:05] firstborn for him to say get
[1:22:09] out take anything you want take your
[1:22:11] cattle take your children take all of
[1:22:14] you here have some gold have some silver
[1:22:17] take it with you just get out you have
[1:22:20] broke us
[1:22:22] completely so Moses leads them
[1:22:28] out when he leads them out of course
[1:22:31] they go across the Red Sea and they end
[1:22:33] up in the wilderness for 40 years I am
[1:22:35] going somewhere I'm not just telling you
[1:22:37] a Bible story I'm going
[1:22:39] somewhere they Circle the they go across
[1:22:43] the Red Sea and they circle around in
[1:22:45] the
[1:22:46] wilderness now I I we get frustrated
[1:22:50] sometimes because of the lapse in the
[1:22:53] time that it takes for us to receive a
[1:23:00] promise and you hear us preachers come
[1:23:04] and we repeat things that have happened
[1:23:06] in the past and I want you to know that
[1:23:09] it's no different than what happened in
[1:23:11] the scripture because God was
[1:23:14] continually reminding the children of
[1:23:17] Israel remember what I did to the
[1:23:22] Egyptians remember what I did at the Red
[1:23:26] Sea remember what I did when you were in
[1:23:30] the wilderness and you needed food
[1:23:33] remember what I did when you needed
[1:23:36] water remember how that you were tired
[1:23:39] of the Mana and you asked for quail and
[1:23:42] I gave you Quail remember remember
[1:23:45] remember so when us preachers come to
[1:23:48] the pulpit and we say remember when God
[1:23:51] did this it is not just a Pepto it is
[1:23:55] because God wants you to know that he
[1:23:58] has not forgotten what he's doing and
[1:24:01] that he has done it before and he'll do
[1:24:03] it
[1:24:06] again so they wander around in the
[1:24:09] wilderness now we we've got to take time
[1:24:11] to remember that when they got to the
[1:24:15] Wilderness that God
[1:24:18] chose through Moses to send out 12 Spies
[1:24:23] and to look at the land that's right God
[1:24:26] promised the land and I'm going to send
[1:24:29] out somebody from each tribe to go and
[1:24:32] search the land out and you are to come
[1:24:35] back and give us a report of what you
[1:24:38] find you
[1:24:46] go now what if every
[1:24:51] preacher that came and stood behind the
[1:24:54] pool
[1:24:55] Pulpit came
[1:24:59] with a report of
[1:25:03] evil as 10 of those spies
[1:25:09] did they're grasshoppers in our
[1:25:13] sight they're
[1:25:14] Giants you can't have the baptism of the
[1:25:17] Holy Ghost you can't have speaking in
[1:25:20] tongues you can't have the gifts moving
[1:25:22] among you can't you can't have any of
[1:25:24] that it's too great for us it is it is
[1:25:28] beyond what we are capable of handling
[1:25:32] and so as these spies came back and
[1:25:35] they're given an evil report of a
[1:25:38] natural land that was promised to
[1:25:41] them
[1:25:42] then God said okay have it your way yeah
[1:25:47] and so they roam around in the
[1:25:49] wilderness for 40 Years sir yes sir
[1:25:54] now these 40
[1:25:57] years God chose to do this to let a
[1:26:02] generation pass
[1:26:05] away all of the while that they're in
[1:26:08] the wilderness God was doing miraculous
[1:26:11] things miraculous things even for the
[1:26:15] ones that came back with an evil report
[1:26:17] they needed water too God gave them
[1:26:20] water they needed food too God gave them
[1:26:23] food they needed the pillar of fire and
[1:26:26] the pillar of cloud just like everybody
[1:26:28] else in the camp needed so that they
[1:26:30] didn't bake in the sun although there
[1:26:32] came a time where their life was ended
[1:26:34] and they had to be buried but God
[1:26:36] provided that for them in the wilderness
[1:26:39] and God has provided for the The Good
[1:26:42] the Bad and the Ugly the rain shall
[1:26:45] falls on the just and the unjust God
[1:26:48] does it just like he promised he would
[1:26:51] do it but there came the time when Moses
[1:26:55] was not permitted to cross over and the
[1:26:59] the the authority of leading the
[1:27:01] children of Israel was given over to
[1:27:07] Joshua God Appears to Joshua and says
[1:27:12] Moses my servant is dead today I will
[1:27:16] begin to magnify you in the eyes of the
[1:27:20] people so God begins to magnif IFI
[1:27:24] Joshua in the eyes of the people begins
[1:27:27] to show them that now that Moses is gone
[1:27:31] Joshua is in the leadership God has put
[1:27:34] his seal of approval upon Joshua to lead
[1:27:38] the people now and yes I am sure there
[1:27:41] were people that were there that were
[1:27:43] saying all along that ain't how Moses
[1:27:46] did
[1:27:49] it that isn't how Moses did
[1:27:52] it Moses Moes said Moses said Moses
[1:28:00] said but God
[1:28:03] said Moses my servant is dead the law is
[1:28:09] still in place but I've put you under a
[1:28:12] different
[1:28:14] leadership and I want you to follow this
[1:28:17] leadership as he leads you through uh to
[1:28:22] the promise that I have given you you so
[1:28:25] then God begins to do miraculous things
[1:28:29] under the leadership of of Joshua and we
[1:28:33] know that there were spies that were
[1:28:35] sent over into Jericho and these spies
[1:28:39] ended up in the house of Rahab and as
[1:28:41] Rahab there was s she she put a she put
[1:28:46] a uh a steadfastness she put a
[1:28:49] quickening in the spirit of these young
[1:28:52] men when she said our leaders are scared
[1:28:55] of you guys
[1:28:57] yeah our leaders are shaking in their
[1:29:00] boots every time that you guys are
[1:29:03] mentioned and and we want you to know
[1:29:07] that there is a fear here in Jericho of
[1:29:10] you
[1:29:12] people guys just kind of nodded their
[1:29:16] head nodded their head yes Lord yes Lord
[1:29:20] that's all I needed to hear that's
[1:29:23] that's that's all the report I need to
[1:29:25] take back to that's all I need to take
[1:29:27] back to Joshua I don't need to tell
[1:29:30] Joshua how many people are in that City
[1:29:33] I don't need to tell Joshua how big
[1:29:35] those walls are I don't need to tell no
[1:29:38] all I got to do is go back and say we
[1:29:40] were told that the leaders are shaking
[1:29:44] in their shoes every time we're
[1:29:47] mentioned and there was a woman in that
[1:29:49] City that believed us when we told her
[1:29:53] that you were fixing to take this city
[1:29:55] down and she protected us and she gave
[1:29:59] us a way of escape and she has let us
[1:30:02] down by a a scarlet cord and when we get
[1:30:05] to that City we're going to save her
[1:30:07] house we gave a promise to her so they
[1:30:11] take this report back they take this
[1:30:13] report back to Joshua and Joshua said
[1:30:17] okay that's good enough and then the
[1:30:19] Lord said to Joshua it's time for you to
[1:30:23] get this company
[1:30:24] over
[1:30:28] Jordan impossibility in front of
[1:30:31] them and as the
[1:30:35] impossibility in front of them they all
[1:30:38] see it but God already had a way for
[1:30:42] them to get across and that was once
[1:30:44] again for the sea to open up right now I
[1:30:48] just wonder how many of those people
[1:30:52] that crossed Jordan
[1:30:55] also crossed the Red
[1:31:00] Sea the Bible tells us that the men of
[1:31:03] War had to die out because they had
[1:31:06] brought back this evil
[1:31:09] report and I don't know if you watch
[1:31:11] things the same way that I watch things
[1:31:14] but I have been alive long enough to see
[1:31:18] Men of War leaving the scene because of
[1:31:22] an evil report that was given to the
[1:31:25] Bride of Jesus Christ and that evil
[1:31:28] report was you can't you can't you
[1:31:37] can't now we have been given instruction
[1:31:40] here at the first of the year that we
[1:31:42] were going to be mountain climbing and I
[1:31:44] believe that we've been mountain
[1:31:46] climbing all along but we were told that
[1:31:48] we needed to keep our balance in the
[1:31:51] scripture and as a minister that is my
[1:31:54] wholehearted desire is to keep my
[1:31:57] balance in the scripture and to stay in
[1:31:59] the middle of the road when it comes to
[1:32:02] this message of the hour that we have
[1:32:04] been given but at the same time I want
[1:32:08] to be faithful to declare that there is
[1:32:12] a land to possess for the Bride of Jesus
[1:32:15] Christ that we have never yet took a
[1:32:18] hold
[1:32:20] of I don't want to be one who airs on
[1:32:24] the side of
[1:32:26] caution I would rather put something out
[1:32:30] there that is a little maybe a little
[1:32:32] more than what because what I have
[1:32:35] noticed through the years is that the
[1:32:38] people will never go as far as the
[1:32:41] leader that's
[1:32:44] right so the leader has to take things a
[1:32:48] little bit farther maybe than they
[1:32:50] should be
[1:32:55] so that the people reach up a little bit
[1:32:58] higher than they would to take a hold of
[1:33:01] the promise of God and not to let it
[1:33:04] pass through their fingers and say I
[1:33:07] can't you can you're the Royal Seed of
[1:33:11] Abraham you know who you
[1:33:13] are why would you sit by in the
[1:33:16] wilderness and say the sun's going to
[1:33:19] bake my brains out and I'm going to sit
[1:33:21] right here and die right do it if you
[1:33:25] wish but I have no desire to sit in the
[1:33:29] wilderness and let the let the sun bake
[1:33:32] me and for me to say I can't I can't I
[1:33:36] can't I have been guilty of saying I
[1:33:40] can't I have been guilty of of of of
[1:33:45] wondering about the promises of God I
[1:33:50] have yet here I am in this J UA
[1:33:55] generation and have watched Men of War
[1:33:58] pass off the scene pass off the scene
[1:34:01] pass off the scene pass off this why is
[1:34:03] this it's because God has an army of
[1:34:07] believers who are going to take
[1:34:09] everything in the word that has been
[1:34:11] promised to her everything that the
[1:34:14] prophet gave to us to to to lay right in
[1:34:17] the scripture that will help us to
[1:34:19] better identify who we are and what is
[1:34:22] ours and what we're really here for
[1:34:25] we're not here just to pass time we're
[1:34:28] not here just to take up space we're not
[1:34:31] here just to fill a Pew sir no no no
[1:34:36] no we're not even here just to say I go
[1:34:39] to a certain certain
[1:34:41] church we are the Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:34:45] and Abraham's Royal seed has a promise
[1:34:48] and a promise of a land to possess and
[1:34:52] that is
[1:34:58] everything
[1:35:00] all all a dou l
[1:35:03] all that's
[1:35:06] all so
[1:35:07] now God once again opens up a sea opens
[1:35:12] up a body of water for them to cross
[1:35:16] over and as they cross over I don't know
[1:35:20] Joshua and Caleb I know for sure were
[1:35:22] the only two of that original group of
[1:35:24] Men of War that were permitted to cross
[1:35:27] over now obviously there probably were
[1:35:29] children there were women maybe that
[1:35:31] that had come through the Red Sea I
[1:35:33] don't really know how many there were
[1:35:35] but now they're again seeing the wonders
[1:35:38] of God as The Waters open up before them
[1:35:43] and they cross
[1:35:44] over this Jordan River yes now when they
[1:35:49] get across the Jordan
[1:35:51] River I Can Only Imagine imagine because
[1:35:55] now remember these guys have just come
[1:35:58] back to say I want to tell you
[1:36:01] Joshua that city of Jericho they're
[1:36:04] afraid of us they're all locked up they
[1:36:08] they've got the city barred uptight they
[1:36:10] they're just scared of
[1:36:12] us and there was an
[1:36:15] excitement that went through the camp as
[1:36:18] as this is being told as it starts
[1:36:21] getting out into the camp at Large
[1:36:24] these guys are our our our spies are
[1:36:26] back and they came back with a report
[1:36:29] that that whole city of Jericho is
[1:36:30] scared of us the leaders that they don't
[1:36:33] know what to do they're having Council
[1:36:35] meetings but that the that there's
[1:36:37] nobody going out of the city and nobody
[1:36:39] coming in the city they're just scared
[1:36:41] of us and as that excitement starts
[1:36:43] getting out to the people I can imagine
[1:36:46] there was just something stirring within
[1:36:48] them and God says okay it's time to
[1:36:51] cross the Jordan River so now the
[1:36:53] excitement as the priest with the Ark of
[1:36:55] the Covenant stepped down into the water
[1:36:58] and that water starts rolling back I can
[1:37:00] imagine the level of excitement in the
[1:37:04] people as they cross the Jordan
[1:37:08] River yes sir
[1:37:13] excitement and after they get across the
[1:37:17] Jordan
[1:37:18] River Joshua 5 says it came to pass when
[1:37:22] the king of the amor ites which were on
[1:37:24] the side of Jordan Westward and all the
[1:37:27] kings of the Canaanites were were which
[1:37:29] were by the Sea heard the Lord had dried
[1:37:32] up the Waters of the Jordan from before
[1:37:34] the children of Israel until we were
[1:37:36] passed over that their hearts melted
[1:37:39] neither was their spirit in them anymore
[1:37:42] because of the children of Israel now
[1:37:45] the excitement is building more because
[1:37:47] now it's not just Jericho where the
[1:37:49] people are shaking in their shoes now
[1:37:52] we've got we got the kings of the
[1:37:54] amorites and we got the kings of the
[1:37:56] Canaanites and now that the excitement
[1:37:58] is building it's building it's
[1:38:07] building and God comes to
[1:38:11] Joshua and he says not yet buddy not
[1:38:17] yet we got to have a little stay here in
[1:38:20] the camp a little while and you need to
[1:38:22] pull out a sharp knife
[1:38:34] yeeha all of the excitement that has
[1:38:37] been building in these people because we
[1:38:39] are going to possess the land the Kings
[1:38:43] the king in the the leader inside of
[1:38:45] Jericho the king of the amorites the
[1:38:47] king of the Canaanites all of these guys
[1:38:50] are scared of us God just opened up the
[1:38:52] Jordan River and we all passed over and
[1:38:55] God says
[1:38:57] stop we got a problem we got a
[1:39:01] problem your excitement's building but
[1:39:04] we've got a problem
[1:39:08] here it's time to pull out the knife and
[1:39:12] cut off the excess flesh it's time to
[1:39:15] pull out the knife and do some
[1:39:17] circumcision
[1:39:23] God you have just taken a knife and put
[1:39:26] it in our
[1:39:27] balloon you have taken all of our
[1:39:30] excitement and you have just deflated
[1:39:34] us all the excitement that we had
[1:39:37] building now you tell us we've got to
[1:39:40] stop here and have a delay
[1:39:45] again to have
[1:39:50] circumcision now let's just stop here on
[1:39:52] circumcision because
[1:39:54] circumcision was something that God
[1:39:59] instituted as a covenant for
[1:40:05] Abraham when in Genesis chapter 17 when
[1:40:08] God appeared to Abram as
[1:40:12] elai he appeared to him and he said I am
[1:40:16] almighty God and he's letting Abraham
[1:40:20] know that he has come to the end of
[1:40:22] himself
[1:40:25] he has an ishmail that he has to look at
[1:40:28] but he yet doesn't have a promised son
[1:40:31] through
[1:40:34] Sarah and God appeared to him and says I
[1:40:38] am almighty
[1:40:40] God and I am going to change your name
[1:40:44] I'm going to breathe the breath of life
[1:40:47] into
[1:40:48] you preached it here before if you look
[1:40:51] at their names in Hebrew both of their
[1:40:53] names were added with the same Hebrew
[1:40:56] character ay the Breath of God both of
[1:41:00] them have the same breath breathed into
[1:41:04] them but God
[1:41:07] said
[1:41:09] Abraham I am going to give you a
[1:41:13] promise of a land that you don't yet see
[1:41:17] but I'm going to give you a
[1:41:19] promise but this Pro I'm going to give
[1:41:22] you a covenant of the promise and that
[1:41:24] Covenant is
[1:41:27] circumcision and so right then the Bible
[1:41:30] says the selfsame day that God appeared
[1:41:34] to Abraham and changed his name then
[1:41:37] gave him the Covenant of circumcision
[1:41:40] the selfsame day Abraham was circumcised
[1:41:44] ishmail was circumcised and all of the
[1:41:47] males in Abraham's house were
[1:41:50] circumcised and God gave him a promise
[1:41:53] promise that Abraham never fully
[1:41:58] saw so
[1:42:01] Abraham has eventually has
[1:42:05] Isaac Sarah
[1:42:08] dies Abraham goes on and has another
[1:42:12] wife coutura has six Sons by her but the
[1:42:17] Bible said that Abraham separated all of
[1:42:21] them from the promised
[1:42:25] seed ishmail the sons of the concubine
[1:42:29] they were all separated from Abraham and
[1:42:33] Isaac they were separated from him
[1:42:35] because the promise was to
[1:42:37] Isaac it wasn't to the outside it was to
[1:42:42] Isaac and God separated them so if you
[1:42:45] ever feel separated know that you are
[1:42:48] Abraham's Royal seed and that's exactly
[1:42:52] what God does is that he separates you
[1:42:56] because he has a possession for you to
[1:43:00] possess and he doesn't want ishmael's
[1:43:03] and and six Sons of a Cura mocking you
[1:43:06] every time you talk about your
[1:43:09] promise exactly
[1:43:12] right he wants you to fellowship with
[1:43:15] like-minded believers who are pressing
[1:43:19] toward the promise that God gave to you
[1:43:23] so this Pro this Covenant of
[1:43:25] circumcision now when when uh Abraham
[1:43:29] goes off the scene and Isaac and then
[1:43:31] Jacob and the TW sons of Jacob
[1:43:33] apparently this continued through that
[1:43:35] lineage and and even into the time while
[1:43:38] that the they were in captivity in Egypt
[1:43:41] because when they came out of
[1:43:44] Egypt the men of War were circumcised
[1:43:48] the Bible tells us
[1:43:51] that okay
[1:43:53] so now it's passed down through all that
[1:43:57] lineage these men are they they come out
[1:44:00] of Egypt cross the Red
[1:44:03] Sea Moses goes up on the mountain comes
[1:44:07] down and he is given the law now the
[1:44:11] Bible tells us in Leviticus that
[1:44:16] Moses gave them the word of the Lord
[1:44:18] that they were to circumcise the male
[1:44:21] child on the eighth day
[1:44:24] right but when we read Joshua chap 5 the
[1:44:29] scripture tells us that
[1:44:33] somewhere somebody
[1:44:35] forgot or somebody
[1:44:42] rebelled doesn't specifically
[1:44:45] say but as I was as I was pondering the
[1:44:48] scripture last night I thought
[1:44:50] how how if a group of people could keep
[1:44:54] a a a covenant with the Lord through
[1:44:58] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the
[1:45:02] sons of Jacob in in in Egypt even to the
[1:45:05] point they were circumcised and and no
[1:45:08] doubt Moses was was circumcised on the
[1:45:11] eighth day even before he ever got to
[1:45:13] Pharaoh's Palace he was circumcised but
[1:45:15] these they just kept this Covenant of
[1:45:19] circumcision and when they came out of
[1:45:22] Egypt and they cross the Red Sea
[1:45:24] circumcision was being
[1:45:27] done but when they got to the
[1:45:30] Wilderness and Moses comes back with the
[1:45:33] law God reiterates to them through the
[1:45:37] law that circumcision was a part of the
[1:45:40] Covenant that he wanted them to keep but
[1:45:42] yet when Joshua we read here in the Book
[1:45:45] of Joshua that somebody let go of
[1:45:48] something in the
[1:45:50] wilderness there was a gener ation of
[1:45:53] men and women as the men of War died out
[1:46:00] yes there was still a
[1:46:04] generation that wasn't doing what they
[1:46:07] were supposed to be
[1:46:09] doing so much to the point that when God
[1:46:12] again took them over a body of water and
[1:46:16] there was an excitement that was
[1:46:17] building in them that they were fixing
[1:46:20] to go get the land that God promised
[1:46:23] them and Joshua says oh wait a minute
[1:46:26] I've got a word from the Lord that we've
[1:46:28] got to stop right here and that we've
[1:46:31] got to do some
[1:46:32] circumcision there's some extra flesh
[1:46:35] that doesn't need to be carried into
[1:46:37] battle there's some extra stuff that's
[1:46:39] hanging on to somebody that doesn't need
[1:46:42] to be carried this is God's
[1:46:48] covenant there are people that think
[1:46:50] it's cruel and unusual punishment
[1:46:53] but it's God's
[1:46:55] covenant there are people who do not
[1:47:00] understand the Covenant that God has
[1:47:03] with the bride in the end time that you
[1:47:05] will take on every word and that you'll
[1:47:09] cut off all the excess
[1:47:14] flesh
[1:47:17] so brother brenham's day we kept hearing
[1:47:21] a phrase over and over over the days of
[1:47:24] Miracles are
[1:47:26] passed that was the phrase that was used
[1:47:29] in his day God used him for a message of
[1:47:32] Divine Healing to the world that's right
[1:47:34] and that phrase that was used in his day
[1:47:36] was that the days of Miracles are passed
[1:47:40] and he had to combat that everywhere
[1:47:42] that he went because there were Men of
[1:47:46] War there were Men of War that rather
[1:47:51] than receiving the baptism of the Holy
[1:47:54] Ghost and recognizing that everything in
[1:47:58] the book belonged to them they decided
[1:48:01] that they would better be able to serve
[1:48:04] the people with an intellectual
[1:48:06] knowledge of the scripture they could
[1:48:08] break it down and give it in better
[1:48:11] bite-sized pieces to the people until
[1:48:14] that they had completely taken the
[1:48:17] blessing of divine Miracles away from
[1:48:21] the people divine healing
[1:48:24] right and we see this happen over and
[1:48:27] over and over again and we were given a
[1:48:30] message to us that all that God had ever
[1:48:34] said about Abraham's seed was to the
[1:48:40] elect right and in brother brandom's
[1:48:43] time momentum
[1:48:45] built momentum
[1:48:49] built people were seeing again the
[1:48:52] Miracles right that God had for people's
[1:48:55] bodies that they could be healed
[1:48:58] divinely healed and God never took it
[1:49:03] away he
[1:49:06] didn't God didn't say here it is and
[1:49:08] then say okay I'm done with it take it
[1:49:12] back he's a god of
[1:49:18] addition we need to do some
[1:49:20] subtraction but he is the god God of
[1:49:23] addition right and so as with Joshua
[1:49:27] Joshua is now looking at the people and
[1:49:30] he's saying we have carried some things
[1:49:33] with us across the Jordan that should
[1:49:36] have been left on the other side but God
[1:49:39] wanted to do some things for us and now
[1:49:43] Moses is
[1:49:46] dead God put this commission upon me
[1:49:50] Joshua to lead you you to
[1:49:54] possess what was
[1:49:57] yours now we've got to remember some
[1:49:59] things here because there were some
[1:50:01] people on the other side of
[1:50:04] Jordan where they had camped the night
[1:50:07] before that didn't want to go
[1:50:11] fight we've already got our
[1:50:13] possession we we've we've got what
[1:50:15] belongs to us you know we're we're fine
[1:50:20] you you go across if you want to
[1:50:23] you you you go be one of them churches
[1:50:25] that has crying screaming shouting acts
[1:50:27] 238 youngans crying and crying slobber
[1:50:31] and snotting you you do that if you want
[1:50:33] to but we're satisfied over
[1:50:40] here know
[1:50:43] I'm I'm just not all that emotional and
[1:50:47] you know if this is all the higher I can
[1:50:48] get my hand you you you just got to deal
[1:50:50] with it
[1:50:57] you got rotator cuff
[1:51:01] problems God's still Divine healer we
[1:51:03] can get it up higher than
[1:51:04] that you know we can get both of them
[1:51:08] up we can we can get here where the sign
[1:51:11] of surrender
[1:51:13] is we can we can let the Lord know we're
[1:51:17] just raising the white right White Flag
[1:51:19] I've had all of me that I can stand my
[1:51:21] way ain't working
[1:51:23] my intellectualism just ain't getting me
[1:51:25] where I need to be my intellectualism
[1:51:27] ain't getting me across the Jordan River
[1:51:29] my intellectualism ain't getting me to
[1:51:31] help me to take care of Jericho my
[1:51:33] intellectualism ain't giving me the
[1:51:35] grace I need to to to fight pornography
[1:51:38] my intellectualism ain't giving me what
[1:51:40] I need to be able to put down the
[1:51:42] thoughts that caus me to be suicidal I
[1:51:45] just rais my hands in a surrender Lord
[1:51:48] that I've got to have a
[1:51:51] circumcision some body let it fail
[1:51:53] somewhere but I've got to have a
[1:52:00] circumcision nobody wants the bloody
[1:52:04] mess nobody wants
[1:52:08] it but after a while the bloody mess is
[1:52:12] necessary because we just aren't
[1:52:15] Conquering the way we should be not
[1:52:18] enough Victory keeping everything that
[1:52:21] we think belongs to
[1:52:29] us people don't like it when we talk
[1:52:34] about as was done here on Tuesday night
[1:52:37] the the Christmas tree and the necklaces
[1:52:39] and and all of these things and and I'm
[1:52:41] not here to even talk about them today
[1:52:43] but I I go back to leody deia yeah
[1:52:47] people's
[1:52:49] rights the age of people's rights
[1:52:53] and so when God comes and he says to us
[1:52:57] and he says why don't you just let that
[1:53:00] thing go you don't need it right and our
[1:53:05] attitude of response toward him and when
[1:53:09] we say but it's my
[1:53:14] right
[1:53:17] yeah this person had it why can't I
[1:53:21] justify it ourselves and it's our right
[1:53:24] to keep
[1:53:26] it that is the age of leod DEA
[1:53:31] right well what about you preacher do
[1:53:33] you have some things that you don't oh
[1:53:36] me me and the Lord talk about some
[1:53:37] things
[1:53:38] yes but I'm finding myself in a place
[1:53:43] where that I realize that is the spirit
[1:53:46] of Leo deia and I don't want any of Leo
[1:53:50] deia to be on me I don't don't even want
[1:53:53] the smell of lead DEA on me because that
[1:53:57] that thing keeps creeping back in and
[1:53:59] and and and we we seen that when when
[1:54:03] Moses was alive and the Word was being
[1:54:06] laid down that the people stayed in Step
[1:54:10] because Moses was there to say
[1:54:15] uh-uh that's not according to the word
[1:54:19] right see people have a problem
[1:54:24] differentiating the
[1:54:27] gift and the
[1:54:30] man because when a man stands behind
[1:54:34] this sacred desk and the anointing comes
[1:54:37] there is a message that goes forth
[1:54:40] that's right but when the man steps out
[1:54:43] of the pulpit and the anointing leaves
[1:54:47] him he has to go home just like any
[1:54:50] other man in this church
[1:54:52] and he has to be the head of his
[1:54:55] house just like any other man in this
[1:54:58] church or anywhere else he's got to be
[1:55:00] the man of his
[1:55:02] house and
[1:55:04] unfortunately the anointing is not the
[1:55:07] same and so then we use it as excuse
[1:55:12] because the preacher's household does it
[1:55:15] wait a
[1:55:17] minute wait a
[1:55:19] minute the word is the word
[1:55:22] that's it changes
[1:55:28] not and the preacher has to live with
[1:55:32] his wife and with his children just the
[1:55:35] same way as any other man that has a
[1:55:38] wife and children and he has to choose
[1:55:41] his
[1:55:44] battles and so that's why we have quotes
[1:55:47] that says there
[1:55:48] was Christmas tree for Joseph
[1:55:54] girl cutter
[1:55:57] bangs picture with the pearls around the
[1:56:00] neck all of these things because
[1:56:05] the it's the spirit of
[1:56:08] leoda it's my right I can have it
[1:56:12] because it's my
[1:56:17] right we may have even crossed over
[1:56:20] Jordan but now Joshua was saying wait a
[1:56:23] minute
[1:56:25] folks you may be excited to go take
[1:56:28] Jericho but my papa says we've got to
[1:56:32] have a stay right here and there has to
[1:56:38] be a
[1:56:39] circumcision before we can move
[1:56:43] forward and so we wonder sometimes why
[1:56:47] that the word comes to cut us and it
[1:56:50] cuts off that excess flesh and there
[1:56:56] listen I'm with
[1:56:58] you I feel like I've been in this thing
[1:57:01] long enough that can it be done
[1:57:05] already is there do I say do I am I so
[1:57:09] stubborn that that that that that I I
[1:57:13] the knife still has to be brought
[1:57:18] out but the best thing that I can do
[1:57:23] is to say yes
[1:57:25] Lord
[1:57:27] I you've revealed it I you've revealed
[1:57:31] that you want to cut it off my
[1:57:33] stubbornness my anger my unforgiveness
[1:57:37] my bitterness you want to cut all of
[1:57:40] that stuff out of me and and you don't
[1:57:43] want me to go into a war with my
[1:57:46] bitterness because I will react to
[1:57:49] things in a wrong way and I will find
[1:57:52] myself in Friendly Fire because I
[1:57:55] allowed un un undone
[1:57:59] stuff undone stuff that I carried with
[1:58:03] me into a battle and I find myself
[1:58:06] bloody and I find my brother bloody
[1:58:09] because that I had stuff in me that I
[1:58:13] didn't allow the Holy Spirit to cut out
[1:58:17] and then we get in a battle together and
[1:58:20] something doesn't go we don't have just
[1:58:22] exactly the same idea about how we're
[1:58:26] going to overcome the conflict and then
[1:58:29] rather than putting our focus on the
[1:58:31] enemy we started each
[1:58:33] other because that we have not let the
[1:58:37] excess flesh be cut
[1:58:39] off the possession is still there to
[1:58:42] get the land is still in front of us
[1:58:46] Jericho is still there and they're still
[1:58:49] shaking in their shoes yes sir
[1:58:57] we're out here having a bloody
[1:58:59] party with a sharp knife in a very
[1:59:02] private part right that doesn't feel
[1:59:06] good but the land is still there to
[1:59:09] possess Jericho is still straightly shut
[1:59:12] up they're still the land that God is
[1:59:16] given to us but God is currently cutting
[1:59:19] things out of us
[1:59:22] we've seen
[1:59:23] victories we have we have seen victories
[1:59:26] you let me show you how this works they
[1:59:28] went and took
[1:59:30] Jericho nobody lost
[1:59:32] life they went to another B another
[1:59:35] battle or two nobody lost life but then
[1:59:38] there came the battle at
[1:59:44] Ai and there was
[1:59:47] somebody that the heart hadn't been
[1:59:51] circumcised the foreskin may have been
[1:59:53] but the heart had not
[1:59:57] been and there was
[1:59:59] greed in his
[2:00:02] heart see God has to deal with us about
[2:00:05] greed
[2:00:07] too because we find oursel wanting this
[2:00:10] and wanting that and there's not enough
[2:00:12] money for this and there's not enough
[2:00:13] money for that there's not enough money
[2:00:15] for first Sunday offering but I want
[2:00:17] this and I want that and so I'm going to
[2:00:20] borrow from this to pay this and I'm
[2:00:22] going to use this to do this and we find
[2:00:24] oursel with a greedy heart I'm not here
[2:00:27] to preach to you about money even but
[2:00:30] it's an issue of the heart greed is an
[2:00:32] issue of the
[2:00:34] heart because God can allow us to be
[2:00:37] people of
[2:00:38] wealth without a greedy
[2:00:41] heart because his way of doing things is
[2:00:44] the more you give the more he
[2:00:47] gives the more you hold on to it
[2:00:52] the more he holds on to
[2:00:56] it remember the New Testament concept is
[2:00:59] if you give your life you can keep it
[2:01:03] but if you keep your life you lose
[2:01:09] it I just listened to this
[2:01:12] week early in the week on the teaching
[2:01:14] of Moses where brother Brandon was
[2:01:16] preaching on a Mother's Day preaching to
[2:01:18] the children not the mothers preaching
[2:01:20] to the children
[2:01:22] but it was a Mother's Day and he's
[2:01:24] talking about that scripture with the
[2:01:27] life of Moses how that jocked and amram
[2:01:31] how that amram would go up and he would
[2:01:33] find a place in prayer every night
[2:01:35] because he kept he hearing this bad news
[2:01:38] kept hearing this bad news about what
[2:01:40] was happening how they were killing the
[2:01:42] children and then all of a sudden jocked
[2:01:45] amram comes and says I have a promise of
[2:01:48] a son and the the whole story going
[2:01:51] through it and and brother brandom is
[2:01:52] telling these children the concept of
[2:01:55] giving
[2:01:56] away
[2:02:00] giving and that it will come back to
[2:02:03] you rather than with our stingy or our
[2:02:06] greedy we hold on to
[2:02:08] things and then we end up losing more in
[2:02:11] the
[2:02:14] end that's the way God works that's his
[2:02:18] concept so if we can allow the Holy
[2:02:21] Spirit to cut off the excess flesh there
[2:02:25] is a land to possess for us again we're
[2:02:29] see we we've
[2:02:31] seen Parcels of
[2:02:34] it God just doesn't hold it all for the
[2:02:38] end he gives you things along the way to
[2:02:41] keep you encouraged and it's the grace
[2:02:43] of God to us he keeps us encouraged but
[2:02:47] this this process of circumcision
[2:02:50] happens over and over again again and it
[2:02:53] seems like we're building momentum like
[2:02:55] a we're crossing the Jordan River God
[2:02:56] had opened it up and they're thinking
[2:02:58] about all the C the people shut up
[2:03:00] inside the city and there's momentum
[2:03:01] building and all of a sudden
[2:03:03] circumcision
[2:03:05] time and it just doesn't feel
[2:03:08] good then God lets them go and possess
[2:03:13] yeah and then all of the sudden there's
[2:03:15] an AI because somebody in the camp has
[2:03:18] got some issues and then those issues we
[2:03:21] see that God had to bring them back to
[2:03:24] the camp and say we've got to do some
[2:03:26] soul search in here because something
[2:03:29] got in
[2:03:34] somewhere help me out here his name is
[2:03:36] slipping my mind achen thank you Ain no
[2:03:41] doubt achen was one of them right here
[2:03:43] in Joshua chapter 5 that was
[2:03:48] circumcised but there needed to be
[2:03:50] another circumcision
[2:03:52] of the
[2:03:53] heart because there was something inside
[2:03:56] of
[2:03:56] him that's why intellectual gospel will
[2:03:59] not
[2:04:01] work doing all the right things will not
[2:04:04] work after a while you get tired of it
[2:04:06] and you'll be like some of these that
[2:04:08] have that have said there's no truth
[2:04:11] there I don't know what you people are
[2:04:13] talking about I don't know why you keep
[2:04:14] doing this same stuff it's just religion
[2:04:17] and you keep on it's just a set of rules
[2:04:21] yes for you that's exactly what it was
[2:04:24] was a set of rules for aen that he
[2:04:28] followed the
[2:04:30] rules followed the rules I'm going to be
[2:04:33] circumcised with all the men of War I'm
[2:04:36] I he was a man of war because he was in
[2:04:39] the
[2:04:41] battle but some people lost some lives
[2:04:44] so they had to come back and say what's
[2:04:46] going on here we we've got to do some
[2:04:49] some soul searching we got to do some
[2:04:51] checking
[2:04:53] so they come back to the camp and one by
[2:04:56] one God starts dealing God starts
[2:04:58] dealing God starts
[2:05:01] dealing see friends not every message is
[2:05:05] for you as an
[2:05:09] individual you're not always
[2:05:15] guilty so you don't have to carry guilt
[2:05:17] well every time something like this is
[2:05:19] preached you don't have to carry guilt
[2:05:21] every time
[2:05:23] if you got some things in you that the
[2:05:24] Lord needs to deal with all you got to
[2:05:26] do is say Lord I'm yours I'm sorry uh
[2:05:29] you revealed it and I want rid of it
[2:05:31] give me the
[2:05:34] grace you don't have to leave the house
[2:05:40] depressed you don't have to leave with
[2:05:42] condemnation because there is thou
[2:05:44] therefore no condemnation to those that
[2:05:46] walk in Christ
[2:05:48] Jesus who walk after the spirit and not
[2:05:51] after the
[2:05:53] flesh walking after the spirit God still
[2:05:56] deals with stuff inside of us but we
[2:05:59] don't have to carry condemnation and
[2:06:02] leave out of here now now if you don't
[2:06:04] deal with it while you're here of course
[2:06:06] you may carry and go out of here feeling
[2:06:09] guilty and condemned and whatever and
[2:06:10] God may have to put a little more
[2:06:12] pressure on you for you to say yes has
[2:06:15] anybody ever been there where God where
[2:06:18] where God started dealing with you and
[2:06:20] when the service was over you you hadn't
[2:06:22] been willing yet to let it go and so you
[2:06:24] carried it for another day or a week or
[2:06:27] two weeks or a month or a year you just
[2:06:30] kept on carrying and you lived with that
[2:06:31] condemnation and guilt and and and
[2:06:34] and
[2:06:36] yeah but not every message do you have
[2:06:39] to go out of the house guilty or
[2:06:41] condemned or feeling like it was slung
[2:06:43] at you no no no no there are things that
[2:06:46] are behind us friends there are things
[2:06:49] that some of us have got behind us we
[2:06:52] have conquered and see not everybody is
[2:06:54] on the same
[2:06:57] plane there are some that go before
[2:07:01] there are some that are are pioneers
[2:07:04] that have paved the way there are some
[2:07:06] forerunners that have taken the brunt of
[2:07:09] the battle there are some folks that
[2:07:11] have gone before us who have in prayer
[2:07:15] beat down the devil have beat him back
[2:07:18] so that it wasn't so hard for you
[2:07:22] amen so that you could say yes Lord
[2:07:28] true so as we bring this to a close
[2:07:31] today we just want to tell you you don't
[2:07:35] have to carry
[2:07:37] everything you when when when there is
[2:07:39] when God stops the camp and there's an
[2:07:41] issue and God says it's time to
[2:07:43] circumcise the heart then all you got to
[2:07:46] do is say search me Lord and try me one
[2:07:50] more time
[2:07:52] that's right okay I don't I don't see
[2:07:55] anything in this search that applies to
[2:07:58] me right but that didn't mean there
[2:08:01] wasn't an
[2:08:02] Ain that the Lots didn't eventually get
[2:08:07] to all right aen what have you
[2:08:11] done what are you
[2:08:13] carrying we lost some men in a
[2:08:17] battle and God said we've got to stop
[2:08:20] right here and find out where the sins
[2:08:22] at we we've got to stop it we can't even
[2:08:25] go forward
[2:08:26] conquering what God has already given us
[2:08:31] potentially we got to stop we got just
[2:08:35] like when they got across the Jordan God
[2:08:36] said stop let's do some circum
[2:08:38] circumcision they come out of this
[2:08:40] battle having lost some men they got to
[2:08:42] stop again from from conquering what God
[2:08:44] had already give them they got to stop
[2:08:47] because somebody's greedy and they take
[2:08:49] some time Lots cast down till finally it
[2:08:53] gets to aen all right Ain what what's
[2:08:56] going on and he revealed that he had
[2:08:58] hidden some of the some of The Spoils of
[2:09:01] War in his tent that didn't belong to
[2:09:03] him because God said destroy it you
[2:09:06] don't need to carry any of this
[2:09:07] canaanitish stuff into your house right
[2:09:10] you don't need to keep any of it it's
[2:09:12] not yours it's not going to help you
[2:09:15] attain the promise just let it be leave
[2:09:19] it leave it in Egypt leave
[2:09:22] behind don't take it with
[2:09:24] you musicians I'm going to tell you come
[2:09:27] on this time so the Covenant that God
[2:09:32] gave to Abraham right Abraham never saw
[2:09:36] it he never saw the Fulfillment of the
[2:09:41] land God said I'm going to give you a
[2:09:43] son God did give him a son Isaac that
[2:09:47] was the promise but Abraham never saw
[2:09:50] the Fulfillment of the land of promise
[2:09:52] that was given to him and it passed down
[2:09:54] from generation to generation there
[2:09:57] there came a time that the this Covenant
[2:10:00] was carried on and it was expressed
[2:10:04] through the Covenant of circumcision
[2:10:06] that was how that you were a part of the
[2:10:09] Covenant you kept this Covenant that God
[2:10:11] gave to Abraham so now today here we all
[2:10:15] are are all of these years later this
[2:10:17] Covenant of circumcision that was given
[2:10:19] to Abraham that that was a that was a
[2:10:23] physical Covenant that was given to him
[2:10:25] we have been given a covenant of
[2:10:28] circumcision in the spirit that
[2:10:31] God it's something that has passed down
[2:10:34] see the Covenant of circumcision when
[2:10:36] Abraham did it it was imputed unto him
[2:10:39] for righteousness and when you allow the
[2:10:42] Holy Spirit to come in your life and to
[2:10:45] cut away all of the excess flesh all of
[2:10:48] the things in in your flesh all of the
[2:10:51] things
[2:10:51] in your body in your soul in your
[2:10:54] emotions your mind and your will you
[2:10:57] allow the Holy Spirit to cut all of that
[2:10:59] out of you all you are doing is
[2:11:01] displaying that you are a part of the
[2:11:04] Covenant of Abraham that you are
[2:11:06] Abraham's Royal
[2:11:08] seed and the only thing I want to point
[2:11:11] out is that sometimes God stops the
[2:11:17] group and he pulls out the sharp knife
[2:11:20] of the word
[2:11:24] because
[2:11:25] friends we've seen enough loss of
[2:11:31] life we've seen enough people fall by
[2:11:35] the
[2:11:37] wayside we he we have seen enough
[2:11:41] people who have given
[2:11:44] up because they tried to do it through
[2:11:47] an intellectual gospel
[2:11:52] and they finally got to a point in their
[2:11:54] life where they said what's the
[2:11:58] use why should I keep all of the rules
[2:12:00] when there are people around me that
[2:12:02] look like they're living happy go-lucky
[2:12:04] lives and they live any way that they
[2:12:06] want to live and they do anything that
[2:12:08] they want to do and they drink all the
[2:12:10] drinks that they want to through the
[2:12:11] week and they they they get high on
[2:12:14] marijuana and whatever else they decide
[2:12:16] they want to do and and and here I am
[2:12:18] trying to keep the rules and and I don't
[2:12:20] feel like that I'm any better off than
[2:12:23] they are that is an intellectual
[2:12:28] gospel exactly reasoning a product of
[2:12:33] the Mind the will and the
[2:12:36] emotion and as a person of Covenant it
[2:12:40] is necessary for me to look beyond the
[2:12:43] mind the will and the
[2:12:46] emotion I may see people that look
[2:12:49] happier than I am to
[2:12:52] day what's happiness got to do with
[2:12:55] it for all I
[2:12:59] know they're jacked up on some kind of a
[2:13:04] drug that makes them happier than they
[2:13:06] ought to
[2:13:10] be little veiled thing
[2:13:15] there and it causes them for a moment
[2:13:19] they have to get an outside source that
[2:13:22] is not a spiritual
[2:13:26] Source it's a physical source to make
[2:13:29] them happy for a moment and you know
[2:13:32] what it does it takes them
[2:13:35] broke and you know what else it does it
[2:13:39] makes a beautiful
[2:13:41] woman broken down horrible looking
[2:13:45] without
[2:13:46] teeth and sunken in
[2:13:49] skin and blotches all over her
[2:13:53] skin because she has sought an outside
[2:13:56] source to try to keep her
[2:13:59] happy because there was not a
[2:14:03] circumcision of the Mind the will and
[2:14:06] the emotion and they look for a fleshly
[2:14:09] way to keep them happy for a moment
[2:14:12] friends the Holy Ghost is calling to us
[2:14:15] on a daily basis and once again today to
[2:14:20] let him cir circumcise us in our heart
[2:14:23] and ears once again that we would not be
[2:14:26] stiff necked like the children of Israel
[2:14:29] and that we would not try to satisfy our
[2:14:32] lives with an intellectual gospel and
[2:14:34] then become fed up with it and go back
[2:14:37] to the ways of Egypt but to call to hear
[2:14:40] the call of the spirit to say Moses my
[2:14:44] servant is dead and I'm leading you into
[2:14:47] a land of promise that was promised way
[2:14:51] before
[2:14:54] Moses the promise was way before
[2:14:59] Moses
[2:15:02] way I just give you some little
[2:15:04] interesting thing here before Benjamin
[2:15:06] comes to lead us in
[2:15:08] worship concerning
[2:15:12] possessing the
[2:15:15] land we have the Book of Genesis we have
[2:15:18] a bunch of History then Exodus which is
[2:15:21] the leading of the children of Israel
[2:15:23] out and and all the doings there then we
[2:15:26] have the Book of Leviticus where the law
[2:15:29] is given and we have numbers and we see
[2:15:31] a bunch of happenings there with balum
[2:15:33] and and and all of that and then you get
[2:15:35] to the the fifth book of Moses
[2:15:39] Deuteronomy and 50
[2:15:42] times 50
[2:15:45] verses
[2:15:46] 50
[2:15:48] verses in the book of Deuteronomy
[2:15:52] that used the word possess the
[2:15:56] land possess the inheritance I've given
[2:15:59] you possess the children the the fathers
[2:16:03] have forsaken it but I've given it to
[2:16:04] the children to go
[2:16:06] possess 50 verses in Deuteronomy and mo
[2:16:11] no doubt this is Moses giving the
[2:16:14] children of Israel knowing that that he
[2:16:16] smokee The Rock twice when God told him
[2:16:18] to speak to the Rock and now he's given
[2:16:21] encouragement to a future generation and
[2:16:23] he's wanting them to know that there is
[2:16:25] something there for them to grab a hold
[2:16:27] of don't let I'm giving it to you 50
[2:16:30] times I'm telling you 50 times I don't
[2:16:33] want you to forget it when you're down
[2:16:35] and out when you feel like that you're
[2:16:37] not seeing when God is you in the
[2:16:39] wilderness and he's telling the sharp
[2:16:41] he's telling Joshua to get the sharp
[2:16:43] knife out I just want you to
[2:16:45] remember go possess the land go it's
[2:16:49] yours go possess it were children behind
[2:16:51] you that died in the wilderness that the
[2:16:54] promise was given to them but they chose
[2:16:56] to satisfy the Deeds of the Flesh and
[2:16:59] they chose to believe an evil report but
[2:17:01] I'm bringing the promise forward and
[2:17:03] that's where we're at here in 2024 the
[2:17:06] promise continues to be brought forward
[2:17:09] there were those that fell in the
[2:17:10] wilderness there were those that chose
[2:17:13] an intellectual gospel there are those
[2:17:15] that are choosing Le oysa but as for me

[2:17:34] when there's a when there's an aching in
[2:17:35] the camp I'm just going to throw up my
[2:17:38] hands and say search me Lord if I if

[2:17:57] promised to us in the end time times get
[2:18:00] tough we have seasons where that we want
[2:18:03] to satisfy the Flesh and you come along
[2:18:06] with the knife and we respond in a way
[2:18:09] that says yes Lord God whatever you can
[2:18:13] take from this message today to the
