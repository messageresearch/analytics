[0:00] [Music]
[0:46] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:49] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:51] cry I want to welcome you to the program
[0:54] today and tell you what a joy it is to
[0:57] be able to come to you wherever you are
[0:59] watching this program in all the many
[1:02] nations of the world we've been having a
[1:04] great time these past few weeks in a
[1:08] series on exercising the senses of our
[1:12] spirit and I pray that you have been
[1:15] encouraged and that you have been
[1:17] stirred perhaps it has created something
[1:21] in you that you want to move into this
[1:24] realm of the Spirit and we see that God
[1:27] is taking his people into deeper depths
[1:30] and higher heights in him all over the
[1:34] world things are moving and shaking and
[1:36] stirring the angelic activity is at a
[1:40] very high level there are miracles
[1:42] breaking out and we hear great reports
[1:45] of even creative miracles are taking
[1:48] place and I believe that we're seeing
[1:50] the beginning rumblings of something
[1:54] mighty that we've been believing for
[1:56] praying for preaching about prophesying
[2:00] declaring for so many years now so
[2:02] really it's a very excited time I want
[2:05] to invite you to contact our ministry
[2:08] new hope revival ministries here in
[2:10] Alabama in the United States of America
[2:13] you can see the contact information
[2:15] given to you on the screen visit our
[2:18] ministry website or send us a letter
[2:20] give us a call let us know you're

[2:34] program possible we're so blessed to be
[2:37] a part of two great networks gospel
[2:41] channel coming out of Iceland all across
[2:44] the UK and Scandinavia and Europe and
[2:46] then angel TV coming from indy
[2:50] all through Asia doing a wonderful work
[2:54] for the Lord both of these networks are
[2:56] streamed on the Internet perhaps you may
[2:59] be seeing this program by podcast or DVD
[3:02] anyway it just seems like as technology
[3:05] progresses greater opportunities are
[3:08] made available for us to share what the
[3:11] Lord puts in our hearts and we see that
[3:13] happening and expanding all over the
[3:16] world and I'm excited about it I believe
[3:18] that the teaching that we need is is
[3:21] becoming more readily available God is
[3:24] anointing his servants his teachers is
[3:26] his apostles and prophets and so much is
[3:29] happening right now and I'll just say
[3:31] it's not a time to be slack it's a time
[3:33] to put our shoulder to the plough and
[3:36] press onward and forward toward the
[3:39] prize of the high calling in the Lord
[3:41] Jesus Christ so I encourage you to do
[3:44] that let's look right to the Word of God
[3:45] begin our study today I want to read
[3:48] again in Genesis chapter 2 the book of
[3:52] beginnings Genesis Bereshit in Hebrew in
[3:56] the Torah and I'd like to read two
[3:59] verses from Genesis chapter 2 verse 16
[4:03] and 17 and the Lord God commanded the
[4:07] man saying of every tree of the garden
[4:10] thou mayest freely eat but of the tree
[4:14] of the knowledge of good and evil thou
[4:17] shalt not eat of it for in the day that
[4:19] thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
[4:23] die now on one of the last few programs
[4:26] we talked about the fact that when God
[4:30] created Adam he was placed in what you
[4:34] might call a probationary period in the
[4:38] Garden of Eden and we're now reading in
[4:41] verse 16 and 17 the parameters of this
[4:45] period of probation this is going to be
[4:49] more important to us as we move on in
[4:51] the study I want us to review just a
[4:54] little bit of what we have talked about
[4:56] we we have discovered that man was made
[5:00] to live and to function on to
[5:03] levels the heavenly level the spiritual
[5:08] level through the human spirit and also
[5:12] to function in the earthly level through
[5:16] the realm of the soul and so what we're
[5:19] talking about now is we don't need any
[5:21] practice learning how to live out of our
[5:24] souls we're doing more than enough of
[5:27] that but we feel like that there is a
[5:30] great need among us in our lives as
[5:34] individuals to begin to exercise the
[5:38] gifts to exercise those spiritual senses
[5:43] that have been given to us by God so
[5:46] that we can begin to lean in to the
[5:50] spirit realm we're talking about in the
[5:52] godly sense of the spirit realm and I
[5:55] don't want you to be afraid I want you
[5:57] to watch us very carefully I want you to
[6:00] keep up with the scriptures that we
[6:02] share I don't want anybody to be turned
[6:05] off and feel like we're trying to
[6:07] present something eerie or our new age
[6:09] related I believe what we're sharing is
[6:12] very very biblical I believe that we are
[6:15] just beginning to discover that we were
[6:19] created to function not just survive but
[6:22] function very well on two levels again
[6:27] contacting our earthly environment
[6:29] through our five senses in the realm of
[6:32] the soul and also to contact the spirit
[6:37] realm the heavenly realm and we do that
[6:40] through our spirit man we talked about
[6:43] in Genesis 27 the scripture said and the
[6:47] Lord God formed man of the dust of the
[6:51] ground that speaks of man's dependency
[6:55] on God when Adam came forth from the
[6:58] fingertips of God in the beginning made
[7:01] in the image and in the likeness of God
[7:03] he was completely and totally dependent
[7:07] on God he lived us in a state of total
[7:12] dependency now after the fall he lost
[7:16] that knowing he lost the knowledge of
[7:21] just how dependent he was on God
[7:25] something in Adam died his spirit man
[7:29] and therefore he was no longer able to
[7:32] function totally completely in both the
[7:35] realm of the earth the earthly realm the
[7:38] natural realm and in the spiritual realm
[7:40] he became let's say he became a very
[7:43] earthbound creature and I'm very
[7:46] concerned about the fact that in the
[7:48] body of Christ too many of us are
[7:50] earthbound and we were not made to be
[7:53] earthbound we were made to soar into the
[7:57] heavens spiritually like the Eagles the
[8:00] New Testament says we have been made to
[8:02] sit together in heavenly places in
[8:05] Christ Jesus and I believe that that's
[8:08] more than a promise of a future event I
[8:11] believe it's a state of being that God
[8:14] is calling his body into right now the
[8:17] second part of Genesis chapter 2 verse 7
[8:20] said and breathed into his nostrils the
[8:24] breath of life and man became a living
[8:28] soul now we talked about that at the
[8:32] very base of that word breathe breath
[8:37] this word life it's really in the plural
[8:41] and instead of saying and breathed into
[8:45] his nostrils the breath of life in
[8:48] Hebrew that word would be plural and it
[8:51] would be the breath of lives lives
[8:54] plural and we believe that that is a
[8:57] very clear indication that when God
[9:00] breathed into Adam he was given both
[9:03] life in the soul realm the soul at we
[9:07] are tryin remember we've already touched
[9:09] on that at the very beginning what is
[9:11] man he is spirit soul and body God
[9:15] formed Adam out of the dust of the earth
[9:17] he formed his body from the dust of the
[9:20] earth but Adam did not become a living
[9:22] creature until God breathed the breath
[9:26] of lives do you understand and
[9:29] breath of lives cost Adam in English it
[9:33] says to become a living soul but we
[9:35] understand that he became triune he
[9:38] became also now soul and spirit he was
[9:43] not made from clay we talked about that
[9:45] he was made from dust and the very root
[9:48] of the word dust speaks up dependency
[9:51] and needing God depending on God for his
[9:56] source of life now the scripture that we
[9:59] read at the beginning Genesis 2 16 and
[10:01] 17 talks about the probationary period
[10:04] Adam could not learn to walk in this
[10:07] dependency until he had the opportunity
[10:10] to become independent you understand
[10:13] that in order for him to develop this
[10:16] this lifestyle of dependency God said
[10:19] I'm going to give him free will I'm
[10:22] going to allow him to choose whether or
[10:25] not he wants to live a life of
[10:28] dependency or whether or not he wants to
[10:31] feel independent and of course you know
[10:34] what happened by walking in dependency
[10:37] to God his spirit would have continued
[10:41] to commune with God forever for the rest
[10:45] of his life he would have enjoyed the
[10:48] the soul realm the the soul life but he
[10:53] would have also been able to continue to
[10:56] maintain his spirit life so his spirit
[11:00] life would have grown and expanded you
[11:02] see we we read about this communion I
[11:05] tell you i love it when i think about
[11:08] the the ability that God gave Adam God
[11:12] came down in the cool of the day in the
[11:16] cool of the evening and walked with Adam
[11:19] and Eve in the Garden of Eden what
[11:22] communion what communication what
[11:26] fellowship what relationship Adam
[11:29] totally dependent on his creator but we
[11:34] know what happened we understand what
[11:36] Satan did it was a part of Satan's
[11:39] selfish ambition he said I'm going to
[11:41] ascend I'm going to
[11:43] saw myself above the throne of the
[11:46] Living God and so Satan found an
[11:48] instrument in the garden the serpent and
[11:51] by the way we believe and have every
[11:54] indication to believe that the serpent
[11:57] was not originally a slithering snake on
[12:00] the ground but an upright creature and
[12:03] made very much like the man but did not
[12:07] have sole life in spirit life but made
[12:10] probably very much like an upright
[12:14] creature like the man the the enemy
[12:17] Satan entered into this serpent and the
[12:20] serpent then became a vessel of Satan
[12:24] and he he spewed the lies of the enemy
[12:27] Eve was the first to buy in to those
[12:31] lies and for the purpose of this study
[12:34] we won't go so deeply into that
[12:36] interchange but read it for yourself in
[12:39] the first few chapters of the book of
[12:41] Genesis you'll find out that that the
[12:43] serpent Satan through the serpent told a
[12:46] lie but this lie had some portion of
[12:50] truth and this is how the enemy operates
[12:52] today he lies and deceives but mixed in
[12:56] the deception there is always some truth
[12:59] and that's why we as Christians we as
[13:03] believers need an absolute we need the
[13:05] Word of God and so when I speak to you
[13:08] about the spirit realm when I speak
[13:10] about spiritual gifts when I talk to you
[13:13] or teach about the supernatural visions
[13:16] dreams angels all of this wonderful
[13:19] realm this wonderful realm that you and
[13:23] I were created to function very freely
[13:26] and very naturally in when we start
[13:28] talking about it make sure that you take
[13:31] time to be aburian to be a diligent
[13:34] student of the word and don't you take
[13:37] my word for it you take these things
[13:39] back to the scripture because God has
[13:42] given us an absolute in his word when
[13:47] you hear teaching or preaching that
[13:49] seems a bit unfamiliar don't immediately
[13:51] just cast it out because the cherry pie
[13:54] may have a pit in it you just spit out
[13:56] the
[13:57] it but you keep the pie and the way we
[14:00] do that is by judging everything by the
[14:03] Word of God all the spiritual gifts are
[14:06] to be judged by the word and so we need
[14:10] that maturity in the body of Christ that
[14:12] way we don't get sidetracked we don't
[14:15] get deceived we don't get too far off
[14:17] and I encourage people to check me out I
[14:21] want you to do that I don't believe that
[14:24] God's people should be gullible I don't
[14:26] think we should swallow everything that
[14:29] comes to us in the name of gospel
[14:31] preaching I think we need to not be
[14:33] critical but I think we need to be
[14:35] careful and we need to analyze
[14:38] everything and that's that's ever more
[14:41] the reason why we need to be walking in
[14:44] the spirit realm because the Spirit
[14:47] helps us these Spirit the Holy Spirit of
[14:51] God helps us to discern and to know what
[14:55] the word even says because you could
[14:57] take the word out of context and
[15:00] misjudge something that's going on in
[15:02] your life so we want to be very careful
[15:04] I don't believe that God's people should
[15:06] walk in fear I believe we need to walk
[15:08] in faith and I believe we need to walk
[15:10] in confidence but I do think it would be
[15:12] a good idea for every one of you as
[15:14] believers to pray the prayer that I pray
[15:17] often that God will let me walk in the
[15:20] discerning of spirits that he will give
[15:22] me the anointing of the tzaddik
[15:24] priesthood to be able to discern
[15:27] carefully wisely between that which is
[15:31] holy and that would just profane and I
[15:34] believe that's a very important i'm a
[15:35] little bit off my subject but but i
[15:38] think that's an important teaching i
[15:41] think we need to look into that I really
[15:43] do now when Adam partook of the tree of
[15:46] the knowledge of good and evil the part
[15:48] of adam that was spirit life now because
[15:52] the Bible said if you partake of this
[15:54] tree you're going to die you're going to
[15:57] surely die remember verse 17 talks about
[16:01] that for in the day that you eat thereof
[16:03] you shall surely die now Adam did not
[16:06] die his body did not die his soul
[16:11] who did not die but the part of adam
[16:14] that was spirit life died and i want you
[16:18] to know that's a miserable existence
[16:20] it's kind of like this thought if you
[16:23] don't know what you're missing you don't
[16:25] know what you're missing but Adam did
[16:27] you see Adam had once walked in this
[16:30] triune existence spirit soul and body
[16:34] and he had been able to communicate with
[16:37] God on both levels the realm of the
[16:40] earthly and the realm of the heavenly
[16:41] now this spirit life that was in Adam
[16:44] died and it had to be restored listen I
[16:49] believe everything changed for Adam I
[16:51] really do but i believe it was all a
[16:53] part of God's plan for you and I to
[16:56] learn that we are dependent we are we
[17:00] must walk and and even celebrate our
[17:04] dependency on God we want to be so
[17:08] sufficient in ourselves but listen look
[17:11] what a mess we made of our lives when we
[17:13] were in charge we are dependent on our
[17:17] Creator but that's not something to
[17:19] despise it's something to celebrate look
[17:22] what a price he paid to pay the price to
[17:25] cover our sins to become our
[17:28] propitiation for sin he gave his own
[17:31] life and his own life's blood now in
[17:34] Genesis chapter 3 verse 8 the first part
[17:37] said and they heard the voice of the
[17:39] Lord God walking in the garden in the
[17:42] cool of the day now this happened every
[17:44] day this was the daily fellowship that
[17:47] Adam had with his creator but on this
[17:50] particular day the reaction was
[17:52] different Eve had listened to the lie of
[17:55] the serpent Satan lying through the
[17:58] serpent she had partook of this fruit
[18:01] there's an age-old debate what was the
[18:05] fruit was it an apple was it an epic OTT
[18:08] was it a pair was it a tangerine and I
[18:12] think if you're thinking along those
[18:14] lines you're missing the whole story of
[18:18] the Garden of Eden I remember a great
[18:21] man of God
[18:23] profit in fact who has gone on to be
[18:25] with the Lord many years ago brother
[18:27] Branham he was preaching a little bit
[18:29] about this one time and he said well
[18:32] they tell me that it was an apple and
[18:34] they ate the apple and their eyes were
[18:37] opened and they saw they were naked he
[18:40] said if that is the case I think we need
[18:43] to pass out the apples he was talking
[18:46] about immodesty he was talking about how
[18:49] people were were coming along to to go
[18:52] more and more naked in public and not be
[18:54] you know concerned about covering their
[18:57] bodies and so forth this was in the 50s
[19:00] and 60s it's worse now much much worse
[19:03] and so I think I'll just echo if it if
[19:06] it's not too offensive to you and even
[19:08] if it is I think I'll just echo the
[19:10] words of a great man of God and I'll say
[19:13] that if eating apples would cause
[19:15] everyone to know that they needed to be
[19:17] a little more modest in their lifestyle
[19:19] and behavior I'd say pass the apples if
[19:22] you're looking at to it as a natural
[19:25] fruit I think you're really missing the
[19:27] whole story of what happened and it's a
[19:30] debate that perhaps will always be
[19:32] argued but but really irrelevant really
[19:35] it's it's sort of irrelevant it's a
[19:38] spiritual thing that took place just
[19:40] like Adam didn't die in the natural he
[19:44] died in his spirit his spirit life died
[19:47] and and this is very tragic we
[19:51] understand also from the scripture we've
[19:53] taught on this program many times before
[19:55] that the Bible clearly tells us Adam was
[19:58] not deceived but the woman was deceived
[20:00] well what does that mean it means that
[20:03] Adam knew exactly what he was doing
[20:05] somebody said well doesn't that make
[20:07] Adam a greater sinner than Eve well I
[20:10] wouldn't say it that way but I tell you
[20:12] what it did it made a beautiful type of
[20:15] what Christ the last Adam was going to
[20:18] do Adam the first Adam saw what Eve had
[20:23] done he partook with her in her sin as a
[20:27] covering the Apostle tells us in the New
[20:29] Testament Jesus the same way though he
[20:33] were not a sinner he was not a sinner
[20:36] he bore our sin he carried it to the
[20:39] cross in other words he became guilty
[20:42] for us Adam became guilty out of his
[20:46] love for Eve the Lord Jesus Christ
[20:48] Yeshua HaMashiach the Messiah he became
[20:53] guilty because of his love for us oh I
[20:57] can't say those words without it
[21:01] touching my heart the the price the
[21:04] sacrifice Oh what love we as humans are
[21:09] we have a hard time understanding
[21:13] comprehending that kind of love we're
[21:16] not talking about filial love natural
[21:18] love human love which is a powerful
[21:21] force I'm not in any way under
[21:24] estimating the power of human love a
[21:27] mother's love the love for a husband to
[21:30] his wife and and so forth but it doesn't
[21:33] begin to compare with the boundless
[21:36] infinite unconditional love of God maybe
[21:42] you don't understand maybe you've never
[21:44] really even been told where you live in
[21:47] your culture in your ethnic background
[21:51] maybe you're watching this program and
[21:54] you don't understand how your father
[21:56] loved you so much that he came down he
[22:00] condescended into a human body the Lord
[22:04] Jesus Yeshua died on a cross paid the
[22:08] price with his own blood so that you can
[22:11] be redeemed back to God back to the
[22:14] state of being that Adam had and even a
[22:17] higher life than Adam had in the
[22:20] beginning so that you could be both soul
[22:23] life and spirit life while you're living
[22:26] in your earthly body while I'm getting a
[22:29] little bit off track again but when I
[22:31] start talking about the love of God and
[22:35] the price that he paid it behooves every
[22:38] one of us to surrender and to serve the
[22:42] Lord with everything that we have
[22:45] because he has certainly done
[22:49] a unbelievable thing for us now it says
[22:54] here in Genesis 38 the second part of
[22:57] that verse and Adam and his wife hid
[23:00] themselves every time before they
[23:04] enjoyed this companionship with their
[23:07] Creator in the cool of the evening now
[23:10] the voice of God comes calling and they
[23:13] hide from the presence of the Lord God
[23:16] among the trees of the garden what
[23:19] happened Eve had disobeyed Adam had
[23:22] entered into her disobedience and Adam
[23:26] and Eve had lost their spirit life their
[23:30] eyes were opened and they saw that they
[23:34] were naked they were ashamed and they
[23:37] hid themselves from the Living God now
[23:40] listen to this without this impartation
[23:42] of spirit that had been breathed into
[23:46] Adam he was but dust he was only dust
[23:51] and could not cleave to anyone neither
[23:55] could he have entered into the purpose
[23:58] for which he had been created just as a
[24:02] body and even just as a soul he would
[24:05] not have been able to enter into the
[24:08] purpose for which he was created but
[24:10] because of what the breath of God did it
[24:13] gave him so life yes but it gave him
[24:16] spirit life it brought him into a place
[24:19] of alignment with God and because of
[24:24] that he could enter into his destiny now
[24:26] if your spirit life has not been
[24:29] restored if you've not experienced
[24:31] resurrection in your spirit life then
[24:34] you will not be able to enter into the
[24:36] fullness of your destiny and function as
[24:40] God has created you and designed you to
[24:43] function so we need to look at how is it
[24:46] that we come into that resurrection or
[24:50] renewal of spirit life we want to find
[24:53] out and once we understand how to get
[24:56] that life in us again how do we develop
[24:58] that life how do we exercise the senses
[25:02] of our spirit life so that we come in to
[25:05] that place of oneness and union and
[25:09] communion with God you see I believe it
[25:11] won't just be an Adam and Eve in the
[25:13] garden communing in oneness in
[25:15] fellowship in relationship with God I
[25:17] believe there is a many membered body a
[25:20] company of believers those who are
[25:23] called to overcome who will begin to
[25:26] enter into this place of manifesting
[25:29] that you are a son of God coming into
[25:32] full adoption and with that you will
[25:36] have the authority of your father to
[25:40] conduct his business on planet earth
[25:43] talk about deliverance talk about
[25:46] captives being set free and healings and
[25:50] miracles and creative manifestations of
[25:53] the word that is the season that God is
[25:57] calling us into right now the natural
[26:00] man the earthly man who is body and soul
[26:04] cannot cleave independency it's not any
[26:08] there's something that's got to be added
[26:11] to him and that is spirit life the
[26:15] resurrection of his spirit life
[26:18] restoring us back to that place where
[26:21] Adam walked with God in the beginning it
[26:24] takes an act of redemption it takes a
[26:27] release of the Spirit of God into you to
[26:32] resurrect your spirit to give you the
[26:36] power and the authority and so it takes
[26:39] an act of redemption the Creator
[26:41] restoring what was lost in the fall we
[26:45] read about that the the Spirit of God
[26:47] the Lord God breathed into him I like
[26:51] John chapter 20 and verse 22 we read
[26:55] that and maybe we should look at it here
[26:57] we've got just it well let me read verse
[27:02] 22 and then close and when he had said
[27:05] this he breathed on them and said to
[27:08] them receive you the Holy Spirit do you
[27:13] notice it's the same way you
[27:15] received the spirit Adam received the
[27:17] spirit by breath and here we read about
[27:21] Jesus breathing on them and they
[27:24] received the Spirit of God there was an
[27:28] awakening there was a resurrection there
[27:30] was a quickening of the human spirit
[27:33] when the Holy Spirit came rushing in I
[27:36] want to pray for you right now as we go
[27:38] off the air father in the name of Jesus
[27:41] I thank you Lord that you've given us
[27:43] this opportunity to lay some more
[27:46] foundation and some groundwork for some
[27:49] of the things that we're going to share
[27:51] in the near future thank you for the
[27:52] anointing that's with us right here
[27:54] today and I pray for healing to the sick
[27:57] and the oppressed and I pray for
[27:59] resurrection life to quicken to awaken
[28:03] the spirit life of every man woman boy
[28:06] or girl who's watching this program
[28:09] today let revival let revolution break
[28:13] forth in our world in the nations of the
