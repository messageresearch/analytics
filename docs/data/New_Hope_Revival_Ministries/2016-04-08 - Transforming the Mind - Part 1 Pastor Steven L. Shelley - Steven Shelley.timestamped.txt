[0:16] Hello, I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of New
[0:18] Hope Revival Ministries. I wanted to
[0:21] come to you today and just share with
[0:23] you a few things that the Lord has been
[0:25] doing in my life. Not because my life is
[0:28] so special or unique, but because I have
[0:30] always believed that if the Lord is
[0:33] dealing with one person in a particular
[0:35] way, there's got to be somebody out
[0:37] there somewhere that the Lord is dealing
[0:39] with in at least a similar way. Uh in
[0:42] 2015, at the beginning of the year, the
[0:44] Lord spoke to me about dealing with the
[0:46] junk in my life. Well, it wasn't a word
[0:48] that I exactly wanted to hear. We all
[0:51] would like to hear something maybe
[0:53] sounding a little bit more grand than
[0:55] that. But it led me on a journey. He
[0:58] followed that up by saying, "I want you
[1:00] to be a better reflection of the message
[1:03] that you carry." Now, that's a heavy
[1:05] word because it means that if we're
[1:07] going to preach the gospel, especially
[1:09] the full revelation of Jesus Christ,
[1:12] then we need to be able to come to the
[1:14] place where we can walk it out, where we
[1:16] can live it out, where everything about
[1:18] our lives is a good reflection of what
[1:22] we carry, what we believe, and most of
[1:24] all, who lives inside of us. So, 2015
[1:28] was a year of dealing with my junk.
[1:30] started out in the physical with some
[1:33] sheds and some storage bins that the
[1:35] Lord showed me. I mean, he just brought
[1:37] them before my eyes and I went in and
[1:39] I'm telling you, the hours that I spent
[1:42] going through a life of memories and
[1:45] memorabilia, some of the things I found
[1:48] brought me a lot of joy and some of the
[1:50] things I found brought back a lot of
[1:52] pain, a lot of memories that were not so
[1:54] painful. You know how the journey goes.
[1:57] up and down and sweet times and serious
[2:00] times. But over that year, God really
[2:03] began to transform a lot of things about
[2:06] me by making me deal with some of the
[2:08] things that I had held on to, old hurts.
[2:11] In fact, the Lord brought me back to a
[2:13] place where I could pray for for those
[2:16] who had hurt me, maybe even those I
[2:18] thought I had let go. I had had
[2:20] forgotten about it, but God brought them
[2:22] back and he dealt with me in such a
[2:24] profound way. You've got to be able to
[2:26] pray for them until you can do it
[2:29] without the hurt, without the bad
[2:31] memories, without the bad feelings. Love
[2:34] them like I love them. I'll tell you,
[2:36] it's easy to say, but it's not so hard
[2:37] to do. And over the course of that year,
[2:40] he dealt with me about getting healthier
[2:42] and and he gave me the strength and the
[2:45] courage that I needed to make some
[2:46] positive changes in my life. That
[2:48] journey is not over yet either, but I'm
[2:51] still on the journey because I want to
[2:53] be a better reflection of the message
[2:56] that I carry. I want to be obedient to
[2:58] what the Lord is saying. This year, the
[3:00] Lord has been talking to us about more
[3:02] junk. This time, our thoughts, our
[3:05] attitudes, our perceptions, the way we
[3:08] perceive things. And it's been a journey
[3:10] again because God turns his search light
[3:13] on the good, the bad, and the ugly. But
[3:15] I'm so thankful that he does. I'd rather
[3:18] my father, the one who loves me the
[3:20] most, be the one who points out my
[3:23] shortcomings and failures than anyone
[3:25] out there. And I know a lot of people
[3:27] love me, but nobody loves me like my
[3:29] father loves me. Let me share this
[3:31] scripture with you. Ephesians 4:22 in
[3:34] King James verse 23 says, "And be
[3:37] renewed in the spirit of your mind." But
[3:40] let me read it in the amplified.
[3:42] Ephesians 4:22, 23, 24. Strip yourselves
[3:46] of your former nature. Put off and
[3:49] discard your old unrenewed self which
[3:53] characterized your previous manner of
[3:55] life and become and becomes corrupt
[3:58] through lusts and desires that spring
[4:00] forth from
[4:02] delusion. And be constantly renewed in
[4:05] the spirit of your mind, having a fresh
[4:08] mental and spiritual attitude. and put
[4:11] on the new nature, the regenerate self,
[4:15] created in God's image, godlike in true
[4:19] righteousness and holiness. I love those
[4:21] scriptures and I love the fact that the
[4:24] apostle says, "Be constantly renewed in
[4:27] the spirit of your mind." It's not
[4:29] something you do one time and never have
[4:31] to do it again. We used to sing the song
[4:33] One Day at a Time, Sweet Jesus. But when
[4:35] you're walking through a journey like
[4:37] this process of God showing you the
[4:40] things that you think that are toxic,
[4:42] it's more like one second at a time,
[4:44] sweet Jesus. Because it's a journey and
[4:47] a process of constantly renewing the
[4:50] mind, grabbing a hold of those thoughts
[4:52] that are contrary to God's word, pulling
[4:55] them down and stuffing them under the
[4:58] blood of Jesus Christ. We have such
[5:00] power and authority to do that if we
[5:02] just trust him. There's so much more
[5:04] that I want to share with you that God
[5:06] has been teaching us and we'll do it
[5:08] another time, but I just wanted to give
[5:10] you this little word to get us started.
[5:13] You don't have to believe it just
[5:15] because you think it. That old accuser,
[5:18] our enemy, will lie until you believe
[5:22] what he has to say. Instead, choose
[5:24] today to believe what God's word has
[5:27] said about you. And it'll make your day
[5:30] go a whole lot smoother. I promise. God
[5:33] bless you until next time.
