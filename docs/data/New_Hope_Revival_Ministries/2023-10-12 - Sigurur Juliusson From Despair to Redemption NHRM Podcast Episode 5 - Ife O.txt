In this captivating interview, Brother Siggi from Iceland unfolds his extraordinary journey, which takes us from a turbulent life of drugs and crime into a profound encounter with the spirit realm.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] hi I'm Joshua Shelly and I'd like to welcome you to another nhrm podcast uh I know we've been a little bit slow getting these out here recently just it's been difficult with schedules and everything but we're trying to get back on track with them and coming out with one every month so we hope to start doing that again uh it's we're having camp meeting right now our church and so there's a lot of guests that are coming in and when I was thinking about who I would like to have on this podcast this brother came to mind so I reached out to Hawk and um asked him if he would be you know would he asked him if he'd be willing to do this with me and of course he said he would so without further Ado I'd like to welcome brother Ziggy from Iceland it's an honor to have him here with us during not only during the camp meeting but during this podcast with me I can't wait to hear his testimony and what the Lord is doing for him uh in this time right now so brother Ziggy welcome I'm just glad to have you here thank you thank you good to be here yeah uh I I'm wishing kick straight off and just uh talk a little bit about your upbringing you're growing up how it was like in Iceland you were born and raised in Iceland and you still live there yeah yeah that's right that's right well um I I grew up in a just a regular family like U my father was an engineer on a on a on a fishing boat so he was quite quite often away when I when I was growing up uh but I I would say I was I grow up in a just a regular loving family um and uh after like in those times it's like when you started to go into the teenage years yeah we didn't have the the cell phones that everyone just seems to be able to just stay at home and do nothing yeah U when we were growing up it's like you were always outside you were always finding something to do and and often it was something that you we're not supposed to be doing so U that was like I would say my my my teenager were quite adventurous um and um like also not in a good way maybe but you started uh partying pretty early uh and that for me a little bit grew out of control so going into my my like early 20s you say early 20s so that's around 21 22 correct yes sir yeah yeah so uh I would say that I would I would have I had to developed a problem with with with with drinking and and drugs and stuff like that so uh but I was um if I would just go from that into how I got saved yeah um is like I was I was in I was in a place in in it's like near the airport in Iceland uh where they had like this place you could go like similar to a rehab but it was faith-based okay so they had meetings there and and I was I was like uh that going there like and the first first like experience was like this is not for me you I said this is good for you but it's not good for me so but like before that uh if I would go like a little bit into there was a moment in time for me that um during my like teenage years um that the spirit realm opened up to me like it was it it's like in a in a way like I can just tell you how it started I was laying in bed and the all of a sudden like this was early morning um I don't remember if I had been partying or what but there appeared a spirit being inside the room and I could see it as clearly as I see you and I just I just freaked out and I I I I start started talking to it I said who are you what are you doing in this room what what are you doing here and in in the in the beginning it didn't didn't start to mind me um I I went out my I like I had a girlfriend there at that moment I ran I ran in into the like the living room and called her and I come come into my room and I said do you see this person here and she said no what are you talking about there is a person standing here I'm not you were still looking at it yeah I I went out to the room I came back in and it was still there it was like not like a like a something that you might see like doing if you're intoxicated something like that but if you go out and you come back in it's still there so and I didn't know what to do really it it was it was not leaving then I then I I started I continued interacting with it and it looked at me and it gave me the finger and I I freaked out I I I I I went to I went to bed and and I tried to just close my eyes thinking I was going crazy and then I then I looked and checked it was still there wow and and um at that moment I looked I I I was laying in bed on the side I I I turned up and I looked up and there was like a black like a black SP like a demon or or an angel or something above me and it flew inside of me wow and and now how old would you have been I would say I was around around 18 maybe 90 there and then I really freaked out and at that moment for the for for for a long time after that that realm was open to me and I could see like I could see see like demons and I could see things inside of rooms that were harassing me and like in the beginning I was afraid but then I wasn't saved then at this moment so I just started experimenting with it so I was saying to other people do you see do you see this do you see that over there I was tell pointing to different things like dark dark things and and even like people like sometimes it was just like Spirits spirits of people yeah who were standing and they didn't mind me at all they they didn't even think about me I was looking maybe two people were standing looking at a picture or or seemed to be just talking W so it was pretty it was a was a pretty um profound experience and it end like it ended like um that I would like I remember one time I was in a hotel room I stood against a like a spirit like I told you I started experimenting with it and I stood and I put my hands like towards a spirit being and it put and it stood and put his hands upon me and we were pushing it pushing other and I could feel he could push me back crazy yeah so that's that was and um so if we fast forward a little bit um I am at that at that place where I told you about where people were praising yeah yeah people were praising God and and and I I I remember they offered me into into the room uh you don't you want to pray a little bit with us I went and sat down and and and I stood up pretty quickly said no this is not for me so up until that point you really had no like connection or like religious like upbringing or background or anything this was kind of your first step in yeah well I had like just this like iel is a Christian like has this Christian Foundation okay so I I I knew the The Lord's Prayer and I I I remember I had sometimes like recited that prayer but I didn't have any I didn't have any like I hadn't gone to church on a regular basis or anything like that but that evening when I go into my room after I leave that small prayer group in that uh in that in that play in that rehab place I go into my room and once again uh late at night I see a black figure like and it was like more powerful than I have seen before it was like standing in the corner of the room and it was like sucking energy into it it's like standing there and just like it was like almost like it was alive like wow yeah and um like it was alive I believe but it was like it was all like moving it was very very it was a like a pretty pretty strange experience and at that moment laying in bad I looked up and I said God if you are real can you help me wow and uh that at that moment the I could see like it the the it was like the spirit realm opened and there came a light into the room I could s with my and uh I didn't I didn't know what to say I didn't know who God was I didn't know how to praise him I didn't know what to say so I just started to praise I praise you God I praise you I think you help I help can you help me and the light started moving inside the room and I could almost like I almost witnessed how the Lord just was like fighting for my soul and just winning My Soul at that time yeah and all during the night uh I was like experiencing this and I had a new testament just like like a small like not the whole Bible yeah and I started reading I started reading like just the first page some something drew me to that and I remember when I was reading it it was like light came over it's like it's doubled you you can when you read one you you always have like two like sections on the page there came light over one section as soon as I moved to the other one I could see the other one damp and the other one light up like it was alive and and while I was reading I could hear like almost like flies like trying to buz and like distract me so it was was a pretty pretty um like an experience you never forget for sure yeah so I mean something as real as that is yeah so that was that was and I read the I read I think almost the the whole book of Matthew uh that night and I could just I I I I it was like I was living the story I could like see myself with Jesus and the disciples and just like almost like I was walking with them I was just that they came so much alive to me wow and then next morning like the guy who went into the prayer room and said no this is not for me I was running the hall and say I I I I'm saved I'm saved and everyone just looking at me but what happened to this guy and I told them I told them what happened and it it was pretty amazing so that really that was the moment where you really got saved yeah was right there so you were still in your early 20s right yeah W I would say I was probably around 20 it was in 2002 okay so I'm 21 wow 21 that's amazing yeah I mean just an an like I said experience like that you can never forget something like that that no that that changed that changed a lot I I still had I still had like I was my old self but then now after I got out of the rehab I had all my old friends I had everything but I had this experience but I didn't basically have anyone to like fellowship with or or or go with me on this route so yeah so I just went back to my old friends and and and even if I even if I had that profound experience I still still like went back to do some of the old things but I did but the the difference now was when I maybe went into a party or something you experience kind of like and and then maybe I went to the bathroom I could not look myself in the mirror yeah I like I always stayed in the back of your head kind of just like no I I now I knew that he was watching me yeah he could see what I was doing and I knew it so I had a hard time watching myself I'm sure yeah and so but like it it was like U not long after I got saved that I met Hawk and and you of course yeah yeah and um I had been there um going to to a church which is called Crossing in Iceland and that uh that was like yeah we went we went together to like like a small seminar that they call uh an alpha seminar where where you go into the basics of the Bible and U then he also HW was working at Omega stasan and then with Eric and was helping a little bit with production there and starting to work there a little bit and I was in crin and what changed everything for me I had been there at that time I'm not I'm not sure how many years I was saved maybe 3 years or something like that um and I had been going to this church and I started we started to read the Bible but there was something missing that's that's the reason that probably I fell again because I was I was reading something in the Bible and what I was seeing in the churches I was going uh it didn't match what I was reading in the Bible yeah for sure so there I I and and in my thinking was like is this all there is like and and it wasn't enough for me yeah to sustain me you could say and then Hawk uh at one moment I remember he told me about a a person uh called William Brandon and gave me a a live story about that that that that that brother and when I started reading reading that I could it changed everything for me I could see hey this is the same guy this is the same God I'm reading in the Bible which is working through that person yeah it's not like just emotions and and and singing and running it was something real um so that changed a lot for me and that really turned my faith on fire and I started going in into U into Ministry my so um and I like I know the transition was probably around 200 7 67 then HW is moving here to you guys and God gave me a dream um that this was before I even knew he was moving here i' I went to Haw one day and I told HW I had a dream uh that I was going to work at Omega and hog told me yeah that's pretty amazing because uh I'm I'm moving I'm going away from here what a way to tell you yeah so uh so I that basically was a confirmation because when he came here I took I I took his job and started working at the Omega Channel um as a technician to help him with recording programs and stuff like that and started to taking my first steps into Ministry so and that just started with a website I started with a website started making articles and and um and then it progressed into making like programs television programs uh for the Omega channel was I was sitting and teaching out of the word and then it progressed into having like a small group that I like LED or ped um that was for for a few years and so that is like uh how my like the progression of being saved yeah and and how the first like uh sat bags and going going to find my place you could say um with the Lord and and in and what I believe was his will for me at that time and so yeah that's quite quite quite like this is like the first part we could say yeah um in in the in this uh progress I I met my wife um and we got married and had kids and I like I started to get pressure like we had we we had at that Mo time maybe around 2009 we had two kids we came here like the whole family couple of times couple of times or something like that and I got like the pressure started to to try to go and and get some better work and get like so so I would be able to better support my family and things like that so at a PO at a moment in time I started studying to be an air traffic controller and and went into that and studied that and was even like picked out of a big group to go and and and and train to handle air traffics air traffic over C airport and stayed there for one year so so that is like if we could say the the beginning of at like going into that and staying there for a year then we could say I'm I'm going to go into the beginning of the of the pruning or training process like the like when the Lord starts to like work really work the Deep work and start pulling things out of our lives and I'm staying there and the day before I'm going to get my degree to be like a certified traffic controller and work there and something happens like the day the day before I'm going to the test and I make an I make a mistake some kind somehow I make a mistake and they kick me out wow the day before that that was like a a probably it's like two or three year process of going through school learning everything finishing all the exams being picked and going for one year training and and that all of a sudden yeah it's done and and that I mean that had to be hard yeah it was hard because I mean you know you just like you said went through schooling a year of training and one little mistake and that's it yeah yeah so yeah that's basically it uh but it's like afterwards thinking back because often in the moment you cannot see what is happening but the Lord shows sees everything he knows exactly what what he's doing and and I believe it's like I believe for me it's like he is the alpha omega he knows the beginning from the end he knows all the choices we make he knows everything that we are going to do our mistakes our setbacks and he uses it all to perfect us so but it was hard that was a hard moment and and it was also hard on my wife because she had like expectations of like I was going to be the air traffic controller and we going to have this kind of life and it's like everything is taken down yeah and uh after that uh things start to get a little bit tough and like I'm not in any sure like I'm not basically in any Ministry at that moment I had I had pulled out a little bit I'm going to maybe meetings and some stuff like that just by myself but I'm always through all of all of this I'm always praying and I always have my Bible I always read but sometimes like sometimes it's like I'm on I have this like fire sometimes I'm a little bit lukewarm just this process so this is a when this is finished like going into this study of the air traffic controlling is like probably around 200 10 10 11 something like that and it's like like just like that it's finished around 2 I would say I'm not I'm not 100% of the years but it doesn't matter so around 200 14 15 probably uh and then that is the same moment like I think 2013 I'm pulling out of my like pastoral job with this group and yeah and going we move move to SOS and there uh at SOS I just take a regular job start building up my own businesses and um have this I have this advertisement agent businesses today which is like have been going for many years and doing doing good I always have I have have good clients and things like that but I also went into other things I went into building houses and Selling Houses just like a just trying to be a regular guy basically just trying to whatever yeah just trying to to to support my family well and but it was like it was like Jonah I was like Jonah and it doesn't really matter what I was trying to do it was always some storm following me just uh taking that first house that I decided to build um just a a a pile of problems just the house when I was finished with the house which like uh took around 6 seven months I imported it from lith Lithuania I found out it was in the wrong place on the plot and and that was a major problem and I had to take it out of Sal out of sales and and I had to work on some changes and trying to get that approved uh when that was finished it was already winter time uh at one one moment I I got a phone call then the roof was like ripping off of the of the house because of winds and and flying out out out of the house and it was like like when are this when is this going to stop yeah it just one thing after another yeah and then we was able to fix that uh a few weeks later probably two weeks later I got another call the the roof was again ripping off the house so it was like just a row of things that that just kept happening over and over yeah and when I was seeking the Lord he was giving me Jonah and basically he was saying it like the storm is following you everyone that you will come in contact with and that will be as like in your circle of business or whatever they will be affected by this storm so the guys who who built the foundation they they like I probably built like thousands of Foundations but building it for me it was in the wrong place and just so that was that was like one like I I would say like through this process of trying to go my own way like not following after my calling and just trying to be a regular guy yeah the Lord he he works a work on you a deep work and he gives you like hints like that like hey this is not what you're supposed to be doing for sure it's not working very well what you're trying to doing in your own self so so during that uh time I also like finished that house finally and uh me and my family me and my wife decid to sell the place in cell phones and buy a new place uh and we do that and soon after moving in like when we're just starting to move I start to noticing some things about that house um it started to leak a little bit under the window and I like I started to check a little bit more and I opened up the like the roof and I I took down the insul ation it just poured water from inside out inside the house so and it it came apparent that this house was just it was so badly built uh that it was like you the the easiest part would have been to take it down just and start over again yeah and that during that it was like one year of like going back and forth with the guys who sold us the house arguing trying to find a solution uh and in the end uh I was like fighting it because like this this is a house that that I wanted yeah and then and during like after a year of like going through that Valley I I asked the Lord about it and he told me to give it up so I said okay if you want to pay for this if you want to pay back you can get the the house and they agreed to do that um and after that there was another house that we bought like a during that time like while we were waiting for this year of conflict to finish and I was uh pretty happy with the how that came out but then we bought another house which was like like not finished just the outside and I had to finish that house and when I finished that house then that was not uh good enough so we bought another house so this has been the last few years for me it's like just one thing after it one thing after after another and so that has been uh a very hard and and and difficult like experience for me and my family of course and yeah so and there is a lot of heartaches through that that face which which has which has brought me to to this place now like it was like the the the main theme of all of it is basically that the Lord was just telling me it will be like this until you come back to me yeah it doesn't matter what you do it it it will be like this and but I'm a pretty stubborn guy and uh I have a pretty pretty much energy and I I I have this I have this inside of me that if something is not working or broken I I will fix it yeah and and relying then probably more on myself than I should of course um but going if you go a little bit forward uh to this uh like today it's like I'm in a really good place yeah I'm in a really good place now and and now you can kind of look back on all those trials and stuff and realize what the Lord is really doing and working on you yeah and you know that's exciting because now you can see where you are now because of all that yeah it's basically like that but it's been it's been more difficult than I could have ever imagined it's been so it's been so hard and in in in in in part it's still hard yeah because there are like things that that are that are unresolved which are which have been very difficult like big like hard rejections uh sadness bitterness angers that have come up from all of that so but going like uh looking back it's like you start to see the like you said the work of the Lord yeah and it's like I have a verse in Luke 1733 it says whoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it and whoever shall lose his life shall preserve it amen and it's like in this process I can tell you there was some times that was were really dark and there was actually put like two times that I screamed at the Lord take me from this place take me from this Earth I don't want to be here anymore and then I was I had I had come I had come to the end of myself I had lost a lot of money I had like there was difficulties in in my family there was there was so deep heartaches that I I was just I was at the an I didn't want to continue yeah but it was like it's a strange like also a strange testimony there because as soon as I screamed I was driving my car I screamed at the Lord and I meant it from all my heart take me from this place I don't want to be here one second more and after I screamed that like things started to to to to be to be better it was almost like the Lord said okay I'll give you I I'll give you some relief now and and things started to to be better yeah after that moment and I have uh I have uh let's say yeah I'm trying I'm trying to transition into like the second phase yeah yeah trying to I I like you can maybe sense that I I'm I'm trying to find how deep shall I go it's totally it's totally up to you yeah yeah so um so I I don't know how how how far I want to go down to it but I could say like I could say that it has brought me to a place that I have felt like the biggest sinner no like seeing all the things that the Lord had showed me and done for me and coming to a place like Paul said like just I experience yourself as the biggest sinner yeah and and and seeing then after all of that thing all of those things all of those mistakes all of those heartaches that it was really the Lord all all the time like through everything it was the Lord taking out of myself the self and and helping me to come to the place that like I said I'm ready to lose my life I I I screamed at him to take it and then maybe you will start to in my opinion become qualified so he can come in and live his life through you so that's my basically my prayer today is like when I pray I'm I pray to take over and there is nothing here that that that is basically holding me that I would like to pursue now I try I try to P pursue a lot of things going to that air traffic controlling uh trying to start my own businesses and trying to expand that make money and do well in business all of that means nothing to me now nothing it it's like it it gave me only heartache it gave me no no no like maybe you have like a small like glimpses of of happiness you think you're doing well and like it builds your pride but it's like looking back it it it's it's worthless to me yeah doesn't mean anything and like when I think when you get you can like finally like get to that point I mean everybody get to that point in life and like realize that like yeah none of it is none of it none of anything here really matters yeah like it's you know everything you can do is for the Lord yeah uh and like you like you were saying I think I also said on Hulk when I did one of these with Hawke like I had to realize that same thing about like fully surrendering to the Lord because like I was going through tons of stuff in my life nothing you know nothing like yours but like going through my own trial yeah of course and uh and like I kept like hearing different things like you know people TR to be like remember you know just hold on and you know you got to fully surrender and all that and I was like you know I am I'm coming to church every service I'm worshiping I'm listening to preaching what more do you want me to do like you I thought I was doing everything I needed to do and I ended up having a conversation with Hawk and RJ one day and they something that they both had said that helped me they were like you know you got to start preparing for what's going to come to pass like it you're plan right now may not be working out but it could in the future and so you have to start prepared so like I uh I got touched in one of the services uh a couple months ago and I realized from like that point okay I wasn't doing near enough to fully surrender to the Lord and as soon as I realized that like like personally realized that I was not doing near enough to fully surrender everything started falling into PL you know I started helping leading the service and then this podcast thing was laid on my heart and immediately I was like okay this is going to be my form of ministry to get people on here to tell their testimonies to tell what the Lord's doing in their lives to be able to you know we're so blessed to be able to have this yeah and to be able to you know put these out because it's I mean it's reach so many different people yeah and so like as soon as I realized I had to fully surrender everything just started working out perfect and you know it's it's been amazing just to watch you know just everything bad bad it's great um but I do want to ask you this just backtrack when did you meet did you meet dad be I mean you met Dad when what year do you remember uh I came here I met I met him first here okay you did okay yeah I came here with HW I don't remember exactly the year it was like at the same in the same time he was getting married okay all right so just just just a little after that and yeah I met him and and I I I think this is probably my sixth or seventh wi or something I remember you coming with the family a lot like when I was younger cuz we would always play soccer yeah I think probably probably totally total has been maybe five six seven times now what is the story about the B baptizing people in the prison yeah I do want to hear about that yeah well I was uh I was staying in in in in in a place out of outside of Iceland and um I had to stay there for eight months uh and I was I was in a good place then I was like I already been saved and I was uh I was uh reading my Bible and praying and and I was testifying to these inmates at at that place and at one moment like uh Haw and your father and and and Eric Sigerson and Magnuson and some of the brothers came to visit and and gooder and of course we are we arranged a b like a baptizing service then in the in the ice cold ocean and and baptized probably around three or four guys there wow so that that was nice that was nice it was a nice place and have a golf course and a nice gym and everything so so yeah that's that's that that that is like that was very that was that was a nice time and I would I would like to add one testimony also which is like pretty powerful uh when I was uh when I was uh meeting like when I was meeting my wife in the beginning like there was there was like an ex-boyfriend which was like pretty pretty intense VI violent guy and and they he was like uh he was threatening me on a daily basis like we were talking about real threats and a guy who who who who who like who who if he promises to do something he does it yeah and I started uh in that moment I was already in omea we were going to meetings and me and HW and and I started praying into it because basically what I I I knew about this when I was when I was meeting my wife for the first time I knew about this guy and and no one no one wanted to do anything like to get on the bad side of that person but somehow inside of me I knew that I had a God that was bigger than anything and I did it and then I started going into this like getting these threats and everything for a long time and and the Lord kept bringing me to the Book of Joshua and and this is like a i I will never forget it because it's such a powerful testimony for myself and he gave me the vers 8 and N the the book of the law shall not depart out of the out of thy mouth but Thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then Thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then Thou shalt have good success have I not commanded thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee where with with there soever thou goest goest and he gave me this on on three different occasions when I when when I think we remember when the threats are were probably the most most severe and in the end like at that moment that that person was in prison so he he was not able to to make good on his threats yeah but then the came a time when he was go going to be released and uh at that moment just a few weeks before I got a phone call from we had a like a a um I had a friend which was also like a good friend of his okay so he was often like meeting like like telling me some info and I got this like this offer to pay like amount of money to and if I would pay the amount of money I I would only have both my arms broken nothing more so not a good offer really and uh I like as soon as I got that offer the Lord brought to my mind mind the story of the king I'm not uh I didn't I didn't look it up the story of the king which had trusted the Lord when when the Nations around were coming in to attack and he was see he he he he sought the Lord and the lord gave him victory over those kings or nations but then at a later stage he got he got another like there was a brewing another attack and at that moment that King instead of trusting the Lord he decided to to to ask a fellow King for help and sought the help of another king to to go against these nations or these kings that were attacking and because he did not tress the Lord 100% he lost and was killed and the Lord brought that story to my mind and so I was like that it was like the enemy handed me if you pay then it would be okay so then I would be starting to agreeing with him instead of God and trusting that he would be with me in everything that I where where wherever I go so I said no and and the time came that this guy came out and we got the phone call uh to come and meet him um at that moment there was like a small Revival in Iceland like people in drugs were getting saved and a friend of of of that guy was the leader of that movement wow Baler and and he came was was hosting a meeting and this like this guy had like got in a touch of the Lord and was going to his meetings and he asked me to come and when I came I just went in faith yeah didn't know what to expect what would happen uh and he greeted me kindly and we went to the meeting and like after maybe when when the meeting was finished the preaching was finished um balder calls the guy his friend to come up and go on his knees and ask me to pray over him wow so so going from like that that's that's that's a real testimony of the power of God if you trust him he will bring your enemies to his to your Le so and wow so that's a powerful one but that I just wanted to add it because it shows the faithfulness of the Lord that's and he has protected protected us ever since and and been been very very kind kind is that guy still doing like good like serving the lord and stuff or I'm not sure where where he is today no but I don't think so but I pray for him I pray for him um so that is that is one thing but the hardest part if if you go back to the story and going through this training process I I look I see it now that the Lord has been working a deep work in me through all of that there like if you just look at you look at some of the you just it's like the same with the Bible and the stories of of Our Heroes it's like job and David and all all of these Heroes they they get a touch of the Lord maybe and they're serving the lord but then there's something that comes that just brings them all so far down because Lord is going to bring them up and do something even greater as later States but the hardest part of all of this has been dealing with with the rejection uh the anger and the bitterness of of of what has happened in like in my family and and through all of this heartaches with everything that happened with with the with the with air traffic controlling that had effect on everyone and and so forth but I have I I feel that I have won the victory over that just re not not so far far far back so and the the the Turning Point really was um that I I was like looking into the fall Feast like the fall Feast now in this this year 2023 and I was like teaching in my home group uh I had started like we had all I had I had I didn't did we go into the home group that I had no we didn't go into that no yeah no we haven't yet yeah you said that was going to be for the second phase that you're doing now yeah yeah so basically through some of this these hard years it's like this hard uh period time period was basically 7 years it's like it was basically from 2015 to two until 2022 that I was going through that like low season is like the seasons of the Lord like you have good SE like good seven years and bad Seven Years or or famine and and and prosperity so basically it was seven years and and another thing which I have told to HW um like I think I think probably like not being like 100% certain but the Lord started to show me the number 22 just on a consistent basis I was seeing it everywhere and I think it started 2015 huh so I was seeing it everywhere I was seeing it I was waking up at 2:22 I was I was like driving always driving after a car and there came a car with 22 uh it was everywhere for and I I was asking what is this number what is this number but I I believe now it was Lord the showing me that it would be finished in 2022 yeah so but so uh where where were I you're talking you're about to talk about your home group yeah so yeah seven years of that and going through all of that is like I was starting I I yes I know where where it's going now we I still kept uh touch like with only of course Hawk and and and and like hwk knows all my stories and but we were meeting trying to meet in in the home group a few Brothers maybe three four brothers um like having hard times like and trying to just still trying to be a faithful in meeting and doing something and and after after like in like in 2022 I was telling you about um um I started to just feel I'm waking up again like all of that heartache all of those things that had happened with the business businesses losing money and everything I was just completely broken beaten down and like I told you just please take me from here I I can't go any further um after that things started to brighten up and I believe then probably uh I hope that was the last of last of the hard the hard very hard stuff um but you could say like no trials no testimony for sure I've been dealing with I've been dealing with a lot of things and I believe I've had like overcoming bitterness is probably one of the hardest thing that I've that had to overcome and dealing with the spirits of these worlds the spirit of Jezebel which is now prominent almost everywhere see it's like in families in churches in in societies um and like going to the like going I was reading before I came here this morning I was reading like the story of Elijah like and it just show the two phases of his life as well he's like light says this prophet of God which is like he is experiencing amazing things the Lord is he leads him to to the Mount Carmel Showdown and he he like he slays all the false prophets uh and and the Lord just brings fire on his offering yeah and then he it's like he gets a phone call from Jezebel like with a threat and he just fle so afraid and just tell the Lord just I I just want to die Elijah did after seeing going through all of that and the Lord meets him and and and gives him the Victory and leads him into a fast and he goes on a 40-day fast going back to to like through a journey and and and and goes like in the end like Ahab is killed and Jezebel is killed so that story talks a little bit about things things that I've been going through and going out to maybe like a few months back I was studying the fall Feast um and the Lord told me I I believe like it was like lad of the Lord he told me to go into a three-day fast and this was like not so long ago and that 3-day fast changed everything I believe that three-day fast was was the turning point of me uh finally being able to conquer bitterness and anger and and and offer forgiveness for something that I I had been like having this buness and anger for for for this long time so and uh I started teaching like because of the Fall Feast there I I love the Feast of the Lord yeah and and now we're here at this cab meeting during suot which is like profound um but the the the story of the Fall Feast for me is like looking at how the Israelites how they even like are celebrating the feast today it's like Ros hashana they it's like this preparation preparation they they they go even like 40 days in in front of yam kipur to start preparing themselves yeah and the they they they try to take out all the which is like not like all the sour dough and and go through their houses and it's just it's such a beautiful picture so I was reading that and I really like I had like the Lord told me in the last spring I was listening to Sir like to to Pastor stepen s preaching and I felt I needed to be here like the Lord was leading me here and what I wanted to do is I didn't want to just book a flight and then just wait for cam meeting I was going into this and I had I wanted to really prepare myself so I started I started this this fast I started cleaning out my house I started taking out things that I didn't want and I start pre like teaching my home group home group about this and I it was like amazing how many things came up that the Lord started dealing with the hearts of the people and and then leading up to this place here coming here it's like the last couple of months has been amazing uh I would go if I go a little bit farther back as soon as like in 2022 I made the decision to really okay I'm going to serve the Lord again with everything that is in me just making that decision um like it was like almost like like us like like this the Lord like the home group we had been meeting like three four brothers uh we didn't do anything different but all of a sudden the house was full of people just coming from all over from like 25 20 people now yeah like it's like now that it's like on a regular basis it's like the house is just full at all this that's amazing and and it just happened yeah it just happened coming from the East and the and the west and just people coming everywhere and then coming again and again and and so how did a lot of people find out about it just uh it's basically like only met one sister which like was living in sos and told her about our home group so she came and she was so blessed she started telling some of her friends and then they started telling some of their friends and it just it just like grew like like in a few weeks it was this Full House and so that has been such a blessing and it's like uh now it's like even the house is already like to small so a friend of oie she was able to sell her apartment in reic and she is buying a new bigger house already bought it which is just like 5 minutes away which can host a a more a lot more people that's amazing and U then there is like this place uh near o was just telling me before I came here he was meeting a guy who is like the overseer of a place which is hosting people with disabilities and things like that and they have like a chapel or or a big Hall and all was telling me about the home group this guy because he knew knew from the past or something and this guy started to get real excited about all talking about this and he said hey I have I'm I have a chapel here in a Hall you can come and have meetings here wow so that's something that is opening up all also that's amazing it really is yeah so it's like things are happening pretty fast and then and I'm just so blessed and happy to be able to go back into what I believe and I've always believed that I'm supposed to be doing for sure so uh yeah that is that is basically some of some of some of the like my testimony a little bit I mean you know it's definitely amazing to see how God has worked through you and and is still working through you with this home group and with this whole thing um I like to ask people this at the end if you could give any advice to the young people of this you generation nowadays I mean even your kid you you have young kids well I guess I'm probably not young and any more but was just 10 but you know you know kids you know older teenagers young teenag whatever you know just the youth uh what would what would be some spiritual advice that you could give them something that you've learned you know I howte you to put you on the spot that's okay I no problem no problem I just uh for me it's like going through my testimony and my experience is like like a told you before no trials no testimony yeah and if you if you if you never go if you know if you never have to deal with things and and uh and overcome them how are you going to help other people overcome for sure so this is my story no story is the same yeah and so basically I would I would say like if I would look back I probably might have had been able to take some some easier routes if I had just been more sensitive to the voice of the Lord but in the end he knew my choice before I made it yeah so that is that has been like one of the one of the like the best Revelations that that I have like when I was in my lowest point um and I think I thought I couldn't I I can't even go any further I I I like I told you before I I I feel and still like feel if I look back like I it's just a miracle that I'm here yeah I I I like it has given me so much appreciation for the the for the Lord I like my love for him has grown so much through all of this just seeing that he has loved me unconditionally instead in spite of my failures in spite of all my mistakes and and been willing to for forgive me that that I'm coming like even if I have come up to the point that I feel like I'm not worth it I'm not worth it and I'm that um but he his love is so great and and experiencing that love and experiencing that you are able to maybe give that forward and and like there's so much layers of it like yeah like coming to the to the humility like just being humble in front of the Lord and and just being willing to to surrender your life uh it's hard it's hard to like maybe give advice let's say everything would have worked out well for me let's say that I have built this house and it it just been a a huge success I I I've made a lot of profit and gone into the next houses and next houses where would I be today yeah so it's it's because of his CH Chast chastising and and his love that he he is working this work um through all of the things that we go through so basically an an advice would be to like if if you have if you're going through a trial if you're going through a hard time um I think it it it's like so easy to say you I would recommend you go and pray and I would recommend you do a fast and and read the Bible but I didn't always do that I went often the hard way just just rebelling and and just feeling bitter and anger and but that has that is that is the hard route yeah and and and I would recommend if possible that people would try to find a easier right just go with the Lord right away yeah I mean that's that's some good advice it really is um so that is um yeah I think that like this is a good testimony I have like there are many things that has been happening the last few months um I'm doing I'm doing I I I quit the job that I had I'm just going trying I'm going as much into ministry as I can I'm I'm translating all of the secret of the Kingdom uh series with Neville Johnson and putting on my website probably going to migrate that into a Bible School to start teaching teaching people the foundations of the faith um I'm also I'm also part of a Ministry in in reic which is like people coming out from the streets from drugs from rehabs and just taking their first steps in the faith I'm preaching there once in a while and praying and part of the prayer prayer prayer team to pray for those guys and helping them that's a blessing yeah that's AES blessing to help help in that so a lot of things is happening a lot of good things are happening but the main theme for for me now if if I would just end on this yeah um the main theme of this after all of that I think I believe I'm I'm closer uh to I'm closer to the Lord than ever before and everything is like inside of me is like to like pulling towards Christ in me being fully formed and and I am him this is what we're like of course we're preaching we're in a camp meeting it's like the theme we just we go it has been it has become so real this this uh like the stature of a perfect man he just taking over yeah and when I'm praying like the Lord's Prayer now I I'm I'm going into detail like the P like Pastor has been tell like like having this like the Lord's Prayer just as a foundation for our prayers and I'm going in like into more deep depths when I'm praying it but there is one part of that prayer which is standing out like and has is like the most powerful section for me now when I'm praying is I when I when I come to give me my daily give me today my daily bread and and just like uh like emphasizing around that is like what is that daily bread that Daily Bread is the word of the lord it's like getting the spiritual bread that that it's his will and only his will so that is that is powerful for me yeah for sure well thank you so much for doing this with me coming on uh would you mind praying over everybody and just over this everything before we sign off yeah no problem Jesus we thank you for this moment and time that we were able to be here together and I pray that my testimony all the things that I have gone through F father and and I believe that they for those that love you this all has a meaning this all has some good meaning and and can help other people and I pray for the people that are watching that are going through trials that are having a hard time that feel maybe abandoned or or they don't know what their calling is or and they or or maybe even they have made huge mistakes they have done something that they are almost unable to forgive themselves for I have done I've done things like that that I had a tremendous hard time forgiving myself for but you are so forgiving you are like while we are here while we wake up in the morning and we take the first breath there is still chance there is always chance while we're here to do the right thing and you are forgiving and you want to make us like you so I pray for those that are in a place like that that you might give Comfort healing blessing and strength to endure and see that it is that you are working a work and you are not you you you we could say that you know our choices before we make them this is the biggest Revelation like I I've often said to you father like when I was in my lowest place father you must see a day in the future that I will become a Overcomer over this you had your you you saved me so you must see a place in the future so I want to pray that or I just want to talk and I I pray this in Jesus name but I just want to discour like encourage you with this that it doesn't matter what has happened where you are or what is going on in your life right now the Lord is bigger just give give your whole heart to him and he will bring you out and like in a few in a few time spans all can be different everything can be different amen would you mind if I said a quick prayer over you and your ministry yeah Lord Jesus I just want to thank you for giving us this opportunity to sit down and hear the the work you're
