[0:00] God made a choice and it was so perfect
[0:04] and so complete that he never had to
[0:07] revisit his decision the Spirit has
[0:17] called you and you have believed the
[0:20] truth to evidences that you were chosen
[0:23] from the beginning for salvation I hope
[0:27] you realize this morning that you were
[0:30] chosen for salvation amen and I hope
[0:34] that you realize as I do
[0:36] we were not worthy we did not deserve it
[0:39] we weren't the best of the best of the
[0:42] best in any other way but chosen at one
[0:46] time in one place but it was an eternity
[0:51] not time God made a choice and it was so
[0:56] perfect and so complete that he never
[0:59] had to revisit his decision when he saw
[1:02] you on the barstool when will he saw you
[1:08] having sexual relations outside of
[1:11] marriage when he saw you
[1:14] maybe strung out on drugs when he saw
[1:18] you caught in the clutches of
[1:20] pornography his choice concerning you
[1:24] was so complete and it was so perfect
[1:27] that he never ever had a regret he never
[1:33] revisited his thought it's not your
[1:36] looks it's not your smarts it's not your
[1:39] numbers I have set my love oh my god do
[1:44] you hear that are you elected have you
[1:47] been elected like Israel was elected I
[1:50] have
[1:50] I got in on first feeder you're a chosen
[1:53] generation of peculiar people I've
[1:55] recognized my call my cha his choice for
[1:59] me and my election to him and because of
[2:03] that just like he said to Israel I have
[2:06] set my love upon him he has set his love
[2:09] upon you you wear it like a seal on your
[2:13] arm his love is set upon you you know
[2:20] that's different than his love falling
[2:22] on you cuz if it's falling if love is
[2:25] falling you can get out from under it if
[2:27] it's falling on you you can get away
[2:29] from it but if God said it s et if he
[2:34] has positionally placed his love over
[2:37] your life your loved
