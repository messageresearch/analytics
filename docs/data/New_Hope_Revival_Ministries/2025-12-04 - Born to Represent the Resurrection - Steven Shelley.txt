Description:
The anointing isn't just a feeling—it's a person. His name is Jesus Christ, and when He lives inside you, you carry a reproducible resurrection. The same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead can produce the same life in you. This changes everything about who you are and what you're capable of. You weren't born to be ordinary—you were born to represent the resurrection on earth.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
The anointing is a person &gt;&gt; and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ. I tell you, if the bride has him, if we have him and he's on board and he's living inside of us and we're now living a Christ life, which is a life of anastasis, which is a Greek word that is translated resurrection, but it's NOT JUST A DEATH, a burial, and a resurrection. An anastasis is a reproducible resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; One that not only brings us from death to life, but it's one that we can PASS ON TO SOMEONE ELSE. &gt;&gt; And they can also experience the metamorphosis of anastasis. We can have in our very being a reproducible resurrection. THE SAME LIFE, THE SAME SPIRIT THAT RAISED JESUS from the deadl &gt;&gt; can now live inside of A PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. PRODUCING the same life, the same Mark 16 signs and wonders. THE SICK ARE STILL HEALED. THE DEAD CAN STILL be raised. &gt;&gt; It's the mighty God revealed, unveiled, not only before us, &gt;&gt; but in us. &gt;&gt; JESUS IS THE MYSTERY OF GOD REVEALED. And the bride &gt;&gt; IS THE MYSTERY OF Jesus revealed. &gt;&gt; That's what the message has TAUGHT US. HE'S ALIVE and well in his people. And therefore, we must be an anointed PEOPLE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE FELLOWSHIP with the anointing. &gt;&gt; And that's not just a spirit. &gt;&gt; That's a person. &gt;&gt; There's only one in the Godhead. It's Jesus to us. &gt;&gt; Jehovah of the old &gt;&gt; and the Lord Jesus of the new. I think the need is greater today than it's ever been before for a living, moving, breathing Jesus among us. &gt;&gt; And when I say among us, I mean in you and in you and in you and in you and in me. &gt;&gt; We need him. &gt;&gt; We need him more than we ever have before. &gt;&gt; He can do for us what the doctors can't do. IT'S THE GOD WHO CAN DO FOR you &gt;&gt; what you cannot do &gt;&gt; for yourself. &gt;&gt; How many of you are glad you know him? &gt;&gt; How many of you are glad that he lives on board? &gt;&gt; HE CAN DO FOR US TODAY WHAT WE CANNOT do for ourselves. &gt;&gt; He doesn't change. Not in dispensations. He doesn't change. He's the same God. He just keeps unveiling himself to us. AND REVEALING HIMSELF. HE JUST KEEPS SHOWING UP WHEN WE NEED HIM. &gt;&gt; No matter how wild the storm is, NO MATTER HOW HARD THE TRIAL IS, we must not take our hand off the head of the lamb. HE'LL GET US THROUGH THE TOUGHEST MOMENTS of our life. &gt;&gt; He'll carry us over. &gt;&gt; No matter what it is we face, he's so good. His goodness has been chasing you ever since you surrendered your life to him. God knew my weaknesses. HE KNEW MY FAILURES AND HE ALREADY PROVIDED GRACE. HE ALREADY PROVIDED A WAY OUT. &gt;&gt; HOW MANY OF YOU GLAD THAT WITH EVERY TEMPTATION HE HAS ALREADY MADE A WAY OF ESCAPE? WE CAN GET OUT OF HERE AS overcomers &gt;&gt; as long as we're clinging &gt;&gt; not to just a feeling &gt;&gt; but to him who is the anointed one. &gt;&gt; This is what Messiah means. The anointed one. &gt;&gt; The one who personifies the anointing. How could the bride not be anointed if we're married to the one who is the anointed? &gt;&gt; How could we not be a supernatural people? I want to ask you today, do you know who you are? And if you know who you are, DO YOU KNOW WHAT you are? &gt;&gt; And if you KNOW WHAT YOU ARE, DO YOU REALIZE that you're A SUPERNATURAL PEOPLE? &gt;&gt; WE SERVE A SUPERNATURAL GOD &gt;&gt; who is HE DOESN'T DO SUPERNATURAL. HE is supernatural. &gt;&gt; And we need that. &gt;&gt; YOU THINK BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A PREACHER, YOU'RE GOING TO GET A FREE PASS. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD WANTS TO USE YOU. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU A PART OF THIS BRIDE? ARE YOU A PART OF AN END TIME OVERCOMING BODY OF BELIEVERS? THEN YOU'VE GOT TO be used. &gt;&gt; And when you're a part of this bride, you're born for a big purpose. to represent. He tells US TO REPRESENT the resurrection on the earth. &gt;&gt; Did you know, BROTHER, SISTER, EVERY ONE OF US, WE WERE BORN TO REPRESENT THE RESURRECTION on this earth? &gt;&gt; You think that's a big calling? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think that's a huge calling.
