[1:12:25] Resurrection Life the voice of
[1:12:27] Resurrection in the bride I like to

[1:12:32] how it's going to be the bridegroom
[1:12:33] through the bride will call for the
[1:12:36] resurrection just a little fishy that
[1:12:39] time what's it going to be when the dead
[1:12:41] in Christ shall rise first when you
[1:12:44] think you've taken all you can stand and
[1:12:46] then we come together in one Crescendo
[1:12:49] of God's glory and power and declare
[1:12:52] even so come quickly Lord Jesus
[1:12:55] and he comes darting across the sky to
[1:12:58] pick up those that are his his feet

[1:13:05] he's coming for his bride I'm one of
[1:13:08] those you don't have to believe in a

[1:14:25] used it already as an opportunity to
[1:14:27] pray for him uh it's a lonely place to

[1:14:34] be God help them and strengthen them

[1:15:17] give them a great hedge of protection
[1:15:19] from all the the darts the fiery darts
[1:15:23] of the enemy uh that old Spirit of
[1:15:26] antichrist is still around presenting
[1:15:29] another
[1:15:32] Jesus and that Spirit comes against us
[1:15:35] when we don't even realize the source of
[1:15:37] the attack the mystery of iniquity death
[1:15:40] already work one of the biggest lies on
[1:15:43] the planet today is the Roman Catholic
[1:15:46] lie it's a lie it's deceiving the masses
[1:15:51] it gets in folk like a seed and it
[1:15:54] doesn't want want to turn them loose but
[1:15:56] we were singing today about a fountain
[1:15:59] running toward us a Fountain of Grace

[1:16:56] words just how this miracle had taken
[1:17:01] place that God had sent his son remember
[1:17:07] that it was not a common understanding
[1:17:11] in the time of the Lord Jesus that
[1:17:14] Messiah would be both Lord and God and
[1:17:18] Paul wasn't looking for God he was
[1:17:21] looking for a deliverer what he found
[1:17:23] was a god who came down to deliver a and
[1:17:28] he got a little wordy sometime trying to
[1:17:31] express this

[1:20:59] from the power of
[1:21:02] darkness and hath translated us
[1:21:08] into the kingdom of his dear son when

[1:21:22] saved by grace Washed by by the blood of
[1:21:25] the Lamb you have already been delivered

[1:21:36] already seated together we're already by
[1:21:39] faith
[1:21:40] translated transformed
[1:21:43] transfigured into the
[1:21:46] kingdom of his dear son my my these are
[1:21:49] rich
[1:21:50] words and don't give up we're not there
[1:21:53] yet in whom we have Redemption through
[1:21:56] his blood
[1:21:58] even come on
[1:22:00] now even the Forgiveness of sins who is
[1:22:03] the image Jesus Jesus
[1:22:07] Yeshua who is the
[1:22:11] image the IM not the
[1:22:14] negative the
[1:22:16] image of the invisible God the first
[1:22:22] born of what
[1:22:25] for by him were all things created that
[1:22:29] are in heaven and that are in Earth
[1:22:31] visible and invisible whether they be
[1:22:33] Thrones or dominions or principalities
[1:22:35] or Powers all things were
[1:22:39] created by Him and for him and for him
[1:22:44] this is the mystery of God revealed
[1:22:46] there it is it's beautiful beautiful
[1:22:48] words of Life Hallelujah
[1:22:55] and he is before all things and by
[1:23:00] him all things consist of him it doesn't
[1:23:04] say by him all things
[1:23:08] exist it says all things
[1:23:12] consist it means he is an
[1:23:15] ingredient in all things praise God in
[1:23:20] your heartache he's an
[1:23:22] ingredient uh you might call him the
[1:23:25] main
[1:23:26] ingredient you might call him first on
[1:23:28] the
[1:23:30] label you understand when you're reading
[1:23:32] a label it just really aggravates you
[1:23:35] when you find out that you've paid way
[1:23:38] amounts of money and the first
[1:23:40] ingredient is
[1:23:43] water you see they list the ingredients
[1:23:46] according to the amount I'm never happy
[1:23:49] when the first ingredient is water
[1:23:52] something else of value's got to be in
[1:23:54] there for it to cost that much so when
[1:23:57] uh when it's listed on the be it means
[1:24:00] that that in this product is these
[1:24:05] ingredients they they are
[1:24:10] constituents they are
[1:24:12] ingredients and he is uh uh thank God he
[1:24:18] is an ingredient in everything that we
[1:24:22] face in life all things were
[1:24:25] created by Him and for him th this is
[1:24:30] really really good let's go
[1:24:32] on and he is the head of the
[1:24:35] body the body being the church who is
[1:24:38] the beginning the firstborn from the
[1:24:41] dead that means there'll be others that
[1:24:45] in that in all things he might
[1:24:52] have the preeminence
[1:24:55] in all things that he might have the
[1:24:57] preeminence for it pleased the father
[1:25:01] that in him should all fullness
[1:25:05] dwell This Modern Church world they're
[1:25:09] so afraid of offending the father by
[1:25:12] putting too much emphasis on Jesus
[1:25:15] that's exactly what the eternal spirit
[1:25:17] would have you to do because it was in
[1:25:20] Jesus in Yeshua that all the fullness of
[1:25:24] of God dwelt and that pleased the
[1:25:29] eternal
[1:25:30] spirit it pleased the
[1:25:33] logos he was pleased that he was able to
[1:25:37] deposit all that he was into a
[1:25:41] body because this was his original
[1:25:44] design not for one
[1:25:48] son thank you for helping me but many
[1:25:51] sons and having made peace through the
[1:25:54] blood of his cross by him to reconcile
[1:25:58] all things unto himself by him I say
[1:26:01] whether they be things in Earth or
[1:26:04] things in heaven so the ultimate
[1:26:05] reconciliation of all things is through
[1:26:08] Jesus Christ Our Lord and you that were
[1:26:11] sometimes alienated this is Gentiles
[1:26:13] this is goem uh this is the Nations you
[1:26:17] who were sometimes alienated and enemies
[1:26:19] in your
[1:26:22] mind God didn't call you an eny
[1:26:25] you considered yourself an enemy it was
[1:26:27] a work of your own mind by Wicked Works
[1:26:30] yet
[1:26:31] now even
[1:26:33] you hath he reconciled hath he brought
[1:26:37] in isn't that good in the body of his
[1:26:39] flesh it had to be this way through
[1:26:41] death that you might be presented holy
[1:26:45] unblamable
[1:26:48] unreprovable in his sight you you
[1:26:51] there's no rebuke because he had has
[1:26:54] measured you
[1:26:56] up uh I I I know we're reading but let
[1:26:59] me go ahead and finish now if you
[1:27:01] continue in the faith
[1:27:03] grounded now don't miss the word
[1:27:06] continue because it's part of of John 15
[1:27:11] Paradigm that you must continue to abide
[1:27:15] in him you can't cut yourself off from
[1:27:19] your life source and expect to
[1:27:22] thrive he's the Vine we're the
[1:27:25] branches and he said you know if you
[1:27:28] abide in me and my
[1:27:29] words abide in
[1:27:32] you you've got Authority then to
[1:27:36] ask and what you ask I'm going to give
[1:27:39] it to you you cut yourself off from the
[1:27:42] from the vine and then you ask
[1:27:46] well that that that's not a given
[1:27:48] promise but if you continue to stay in
[1:27:51] him and allow his word to to stay in you
[1:27:55] then you've got the authority to ask
[1:27:57] what you will I like that continue in
[1:28:01] the faith grounded and settled and be
[1:28:03] not moved away from the hope of the
[1:28:05] Gospel which ye have heard and which was
[1:28:08] preached to every creature which is
[1:28:10] under Heaven whereof I Paul am made a
[1:28:14] minister who now rejoice in my
[1:28:17] sufferings for you and fill up that
[1:28:19] which is behind of the afflictions of
[1:28:22] Christ in my flesh for his his body sake
[1:28:25] which is the church I've been so blessed
[1:28:28] Paul said that I'm going to have to
[1:28:30] catch up a little bit on the
[1:28:34] hardships I sing that sometime ly wolf
[1:28:38] wrote if it if it keeps getting better
[1:28:41] and
[1:28:42] better if you if he keeps on pouring it
[1:28:47] on if it gets better than this Lord I
[1:28:50] don't know what I'm going to do and Paul
[1:28:52] said I was in that place and then I was
[1:28:55] reminded that I'm one who is to also
[1:28:58] bear in my body the
[1:29:01] sufferings come on it's part of the
[1:29:04] Fellowship of the mystery it's given
[1:29:07] unto me for you to fulfill the word of
[1:29:10] God God's word must be fulfilled even
[1:29:13] the mystery which hath been hid from
[1:29:15] ages and from Generations but now oh no
[1:29:21] generation could say that like this
[1:29:25] generation but now what has been hidden
[1:29:29] from ages and generations now is made
[1:29:34] manifest come on to his Saints we're
[1:29:39] getting somewhere to whom God would make
[1:29:42] known what is the riches of the glory of
[1:29:47] this
[1:29:49] mystery singular
[1:29:55] not
[1:29:57] Mysteries
[1:29:59] mystery if you're looking for a singular
[1:30:02] mystery to tie in with this you'll find
[1:30:05] it in Revelation
[1:30:08] 10:7 when the
[1:30:10] mystery well here here is part of the
[1:30:15] mystery it is simple it's
[1:30:21] Christ why don't we say in
[1:30:24] me it's Christ in
[1:30:27] me the hope of
[1:30:32] glory Christ in me the hope of
[1:30:36] glory that is the
[1:30:39] mystery that was to be
[1:30:42] finished at the sounding of the seventh
[1:30:46] angel
[1:30:47] messenger it was to be known that you
[1:30:51] were in Christ from the the foundation
[1:30:54] of the world so that in the last age of
[1:30:59] your life you would
[1:31:01] manifest who you are and I am who I am
[1:31:06] because
[1:31:07] of because of who he is Christ in you
[1:31:11] the hope of glory he goes on to say whom
[1:31:15] we preach warning every man and teaching
[1:31:17] every man in all wisdom that we may
[1:31:19] present every
[1:31:21] man perfect
[1:31:25] somebody said nobody's perfect but Jesus
[1:31:27] that's not what the word said you are
[1:31:31] perfect
[1:31:34] in when we're not in him we ain't
[1:31:38] much come on we have no hope the only
[1:31:42] Perfection that we can know is shared
[1:31:45] Perfection it's by holding on to him
[1:31:48] don't ever turn him
[1:31:50] loose don't ever turn him loose let him
[1:31:53] have the preeminence in every part of
[1:31:55] your life let him be the one let him be
[1:31:58] the priority let him be the one you look
[1:32:01] to let everything else decrease that he
[1:32:05] might
[1:32:06] increase don't focus on righteousness
[1:32:09] focus on him if you focus on him you
[1:32:12] have imparted righteousness you have
[1:32:14] imparted forgiveness you have imparted
[1:32:18] Grace excuse me you have imparted
[1:32:22] Perfection whom we preach warning every
[1:32:24] man per uh that that we may present
[1:32:28] every man perfect in Christ Jesus next
[1:32:30] verse where unto I also labor striving
[1:32:35] according to his working which worketh
[1:32:39] in
[1:32:42] me this is that key here that everything
[1:32:46] God has required of you he has provided
[1:32:49] for you in
[1:32:50] Christ oh my
[1:32:54] oh my that means you don't have to pay
[1:32:57] for it the debt is paid the debt is
[1:33:01] settled don't get in the rat race of
[1:33:04] Works don't let the enemy confuse you
[1:33:08] into thinking that if you sin which I I
[1:33:12] I'm hoping that you won't stumble in
[1:33:15] unbelief but if you do please know that
[1:33:18] his gracious Grace has provided
[1:33:21] atonement for past
[1:33:25] present and future
[1:33:28] unrighteousness it's covered if you
[1:33:30] believe that say Amen all right I want
[1:33:32] you to wake up in here just a little
[1:33:35] bit uh some of you are napping nap

[1:33:47] I'm getting a little feisty you're on my
[1:33:49] time
[1:33:52] now I don't know if you know who Adam
[1:33:54] Clark was but he was a um a commentator
[1:34:00] a well-respected
[1:34:01] commentator and when he was writing
[1:34:04] about this preeminence he said that he
[1:34:08] might Jesus that he might be
[1:34:11] considered in
[1:34:13] consequence of his mediatorial office as
[1:34:18] possessing the first place in and being
[1:34:23] chief
[1:34:24] over all the creation of God he's higher
[1:34:30] than the
[1:34:32] highest greater than the
[1:34:34] greatest he is equal to the most high
[1:34:39] therefore he is also most high in the
[1:34:43] message Christ is the mystery of God
[1:34:46] revealed paragraph

[1:34:52] 506 this verse that we just read in
[1:34:55] Colossians so we go to

[1:35:03] is his body and he
[1:35:09] wants I hope you don't find that
[1:35:13] selfish he wants the
[1:35:18] [Music]
[1:35:25] after all it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:35:27] glory don't try to make church about

[1:35:48] have the
[1:35:50] preeminence Among Us in every situation
[1:35:53] and in order for that to happen we have
[1:35:55] to turn away from something else and
[1:35:59] look away unto Jesus there's always
[1:36:02] going to be something negative there's
[1:36:04] always going to be something dark
[1:36:06] there's always going to be something
[1:36:07] painful there's always going to be
[1:36:09] something stressful we're living in an
[1:36:12] hour now where where children will tell
[1:36:15] you I'm
[1:36:19] stressed I I want to ring their Bell
[1:36:25] when they're less than 10 and they say
[1:36:27] I'm
[1:36:29] stressed I it it's such a by word
[1:36:31] there's always going to be
[1:36:35] stresses and that's not because you
[1:36:37] don't have your favorite cereal we're
[1:36:39] talking about real
[1:36:41] stuff you can do without uh Fruity
[1:36:45] Pebbles come on now that's not
[1:36:48] stress but we're going to have stress
[1:36:51] and we have to choose to look away from
[1:36:53] it
[1:36:55] there's always going to be hateful
[1:36:57] words we have to choose to look away
[1:37:00] from it and look to him where does life
[1:37:03] come from him looking to him looking
[1:37:07] away to him he is he is the head of the
[1:37:11] church and he wants the pinenes listen
[1:37:14] now listen close he said he is to be the
[1:37:16] head of the body his bride's body the
[1:37:19] bride Church body which is taken
[1:37:23] from him flesh and Bone like in Adam see
[1:37:29] bride God reached in and separated from
[1:37:33] Adam the feminist part of how he was
[1:37:35] created and made a woman made a bride
[1:37:39] the same way we were in
[1:37:43] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:37:46] world sir and God reached in through the
[1:37:49] truth delivered us pulled us out it was
[1:37:53] an exodus you might say so that we could
[1:37:57] then
[1:37:58] manifest who we are and who we are
[1:38:02] depends on who our husband is you've got
[1:38:04] to stay married to Christ you have to
[1:38:07] abide in him to ever become Ms Jesus
[1:38:10] Christ right all right he said born from
[1:38:14] the dead that's born from the dead the
[1:38:17] sin of unbelief he said what killed Eve
[1:38:20] because remember she wasn't ever going
[1:38:21] to die unbel
[1:38:24] belie watch the wording here he said
[1:38:27] their unbelief in what by uh the the the
[1:38:30] unbelief of in God
[1:38:33] no he said she had faith in God she
[1:38:36] believed that God existed she had had
[1:38:38] fellowship with him she she she wasn't
[1:38:41] an Infidel she knew that that God was
[1:38:45] real she she didn't say there's no God
[1:38:48] no sir she wasn't an Infidel well well
[1:38:51] she said you know I don't believe his
[1:38:53] word at all no she didn't say I don't
[1:38:56] believe his word she believed
[1:39:02] all but one little
[1:39:05] thing that was all it took to throw the
[1:39:08] whole thing out of cater God knew what
[1:39:11] he was
[1:39:12] doing come on the human race sold out
[1:39:17] over one little piece of unbelief just
[1:39:20] one little tiny thing there
[1:39:25] that is what costs so much in the
[1:39:29] message the presence of God
[1:39:32] unrecognized he said that's what we need
[1:39:35] a washing of unbelief
[1:39:38] out on the bank let you read it for
[1:39:45] me let the word of God have
[1:39:51] preeminence it's idle it's necessary not
[1:39:55] the
[1:39:59] cloud the
[1:40:01] word these are dressings these are
[1:40:05] additional things that God has done for
[1:40:09] us signs are uh to help these Gentiles
[1:40:15] believe without signs Gentiles have a
[1:40:18] problem believing so God lets us have
[1:40:21] these things we can't cling to
[1:40:25] signs we must let the
[1:40:31] word have our
[1:40:34] preeminence our Attention our full Focus
[1:40:37] he said that's what we need interesting
[1:40:40] here
[1:40:41] 64 that's what we need a
[1:40:44] Revival and wash all the unbelief out
[1:40:48] and all the
[1:40:50] bugs you think there's any creepy bugs
[1:40:52] that need to be washed out sometime and
[1:40:57] superstitions sir you think we ought to
[1:40:59] be cleansed over and over and over again
[1:41:01] from our
[1:41:03] superstitions oh
[1:41:05] yes we need a Revival for that and
[1:41:08] things he said come out and see that God
[1:41:13] is still God is still God that's what we
[1:41:16] have revivals for to to prove that God
[1:41:21] is still God and that he must have the
[1:41:26] preeminence now now that word
[1:41:29] preeminence is a Greek word
[1:41:32] 4409 it actually comes from a derivative
[1:41:34] of
[1:41:35] 4409
[1:41:37] 4413 and it means to have the first
[1:41:41] place if Christ has the preeminence it
[1:41:45] means that he's number
[1:41:47] one to be in the first position to hold
[1:41:51] the first rank with the the implications
[1:41:54] of high rank and prominence or highest
[1:41:58] dignity to be the first to have super
[1:42:02] Superior status to be chief that he
[1:42:06] might come to have first
[1:42:12] place in
[1:42:16] families in your work
[1:42:18] situation in your
[1:42:21] trials in in in your strains and
[1:42:25] stresses he must have the first position
[1:42:29] he must be Chief if you won't let him be
[1:42:32] Lord of all he's not interested in being
[1:42:34] Lord at all he doesn't want half your
[1:42:37] heart maybe you think that's pickiness
[1:42:40] but he doesn't want half of you he
[1:42:42] doesn't want part of you he wants all of
[1:42:45] you he can't do much with half a head
[1:42:48] with half a body no no he needs a
[1:42:51] single-minded man a double-minded man
[1:42:54] Lord have mercy this is a product of the
[1:42:57] greatest battle ever fought I've never
[1:43:00] lived in such an hour where I've seen so
[1:43:02] many double-minded people I'm bumping
[1:43:05] into them every
[1:43:07] day and remember that doesn't
[1:43:09] necessarily mean mentally unstable it it
[1:43:12] sort of does but in another in more
[1:43:15] spiritual way it it it means declaring
[1:43:19] the faithfulness of God one minute and
[1:43:22] fear the next next and that's a
[1:43:25] challenge because fear is present and it
[1:43:29] it is certainly lurking in our life but
[1:43:33] we have to choose every time over and
[1:43:36] over again and again and again faith and
[1:43:40] not
[1:43:41] fear what if listen if you're if you're
[1:43:44] saying what if you've already opened up
[1:43:46] a door for fear what
[1:43:50] if I'm going to talk I am yes I'm here
[1:43:54] mhm what
[1:43:56] if should
[1:43:59] have could
[1:44:00] have would
[1:44:05] have well I'm going to say this I say it
[1:44:07] a lot I'm going say it again well if
[1:44:09] he'd have just had a better
[1:44:12] doctor doctor killed
[1:44:19] him if he had just had better medication
[1:44:23] if he'd had just been in another
[1:44:25] hospital come on if we could have just
[1:44:28] found it
[1:44:30] earlier all the things that we say as a
[1:44:32] double-minded man right the the reality
[1:44:35] of God's word is he is Sovereign you can
[1:44:39] be sitting at the Mao Clinic with the
[1:44:41] best doctor with the best medicine with
[1:44:44] the best treatment and if God's coming
[1:44:46] to get you you're
[1:44:50] going that's just sovereignty that's
[1:44:52] just what the word
[1:44:55] said and if that is let me let me see
[1:44:57] your hand if you believe that's right
[1:44:59] I'm not I I mean I don't want to I don't
[1:45:00] want to scrutinize you but does anybody
[1:45:02] else believe am I the only one that
[1:45:03] believes that it's not the medicine it's
[1:45:06] not the doctor thank God for them I'm
[1:45:08] not against any of that uh I'm not
[1:45:11] against uh hospitals I'm so glad that're
[1:45:14] they're there when we need them if we
[1:45:17] need them I hope I never need them again
[1:45:19] but I'm glad to know it's there if I
[1:45:21] need it brother you get sick and
[1:45:23] somebody said don't go
[1:45:25] there they'll kill you there you hear
[1:45:29] all kinds of things but but let me see
[1:45:31] again how many of you believe that it's
[1:45:33] it's it's not that it's if God's calling
[1:45:35] you you're
[1:45:37] going you believe that you sure you
[1:45:39] believe that you are you
[1:45:42] sure because if that's the case then you
[1:45:45] cannot spend another day of your life I
[1:45:49] should
[1:45:50] have exactly right
[1:45:57] preaching to you I should
[1:46:00] have I could have I wished I had
[1:46:06] have wished I a call wished I'd have
[1:46:09] went wished I would have done this
[1:46:11] wished I would have done that wished I
[1:46:13] would have done the other don't you
[1:46:16] understand that God at any time can stop
[1:46:20] the cycle of whatever is happening in
[1:46:23] our
[1:46:25] life haven't you heard the story of the
[1:46:28] uh of The
[1:46:30] Reluctant uh person who was to uh knock
[1:46:34] on doors and invite people to
[1:46:37] church and and didn't want to do it but
[1:46:40] agreed to do it reluctantly agreed to do
[1:46:42] it and goes and knocks on the
[1:46:46] door nobody comes knocks again nobody
[1:46:50] comes hear some scurrying around
[1:46:53] skirting around and wondering what's
[1:46:55] going on he said would knock one more
[1:46:56] time and here comes somebody to the door
[1:47:00] he said I'm I'm here to invite you to
[1:47:04] church the person said it's too late for
[1:47:07] me too late for me church I'm too late
[1:47:10] for church I'm too far gone for church
[1:47:13] opens the door and comes in sitting in
[1:47:14] the middle of the floor there he invites
[1:47:18] the man in sitting there in the middle
[1:47:20] of the floor is a stool
[1:47:23] hanging from the rafter of the hallway
[1:47:24] is a
[1:47:26] noose the person's been on the
[1:47:29] stool just about to get the Rope tight
[1:47:33] and the knock comes on the
[1:47:36] door he leads that individual to God let
[1:47:39] me tell you something God is
[1:47:43] Sovereign he knows how to send
[1:47:46] somebody it's like the little lady I
[1:47:48] love that you I'm not going to tell it
[1:47:50] again but you'll get the punchline it's
[1:47:52] like the little lady that said wo yes
[1:47:54] sir God did provide the
[1:47:58] groceries and he made the devil pay for
[1:48:02] them God will use your neighbor God will
[1:48:05] use somebody yes sir if he needs to put
[1:48:08] something to an end he knows how to do
[1:48:10] it so you cannot embrace the full
[1:48:14] sovereignty of God and spend another
[1:48:19] minute I don't care how many rocks are
[1:48:21] being hurled your way how many arrows
[1:48:23] are being thrown at you how many vicious
[1:48:25] satanic lies are being cast your way you
[1:48:29] can't live another moment in that kind
[1:48:31] of place that's what pulls people to the
[1:48:35] edge you must not be double-minded you
[1:48:38] must let Jesus have
[1:48:42] preeminence in every situation look to
[1:48:46] him he's got it he's got it let him wash
[1:48:52] the unbeliever
[1:48:53] in the message the
[1:48:56] token he tells us here and I am looking
[1:48:59] for a time of a Break Forth of the
[1:49:03] spirit of God in these last days that
[1:49:07] we're now living in for another surge of
[1:49:12] the Holy Spirit into the church it's
[1:49:16] like an
[1:49:17] inoculation it's like an infusion a
[1:49:21] surging of Holy Spirit spirit Power into
[1:49:24] the bride church for a rapturing
[1:49:33] faith I know that they're preaching that
[1:49:36] this is come and gone it's
[1:49:38] passed but it's like scripture you can't
[1:49:41] you can't ignore the
[1:49:44] comma you can't drop the the phrase off
[1:49:47] the end and think you've got the whole
[1:49:50] understanding when does that serve of
[1:49:53] Holy Spirit come into the church with
[1:49:56] rapturing faith just
[1:50:01] before it
[1:50:05] comes that's right brother so to say
[1:50:09] that's already happened and we're living
[1:50:11] in the
[1:50:14] surge just before it comes and
[1:50:18] everything is sitting straight in order
[1:50:20] for that that's the thing you can
[1:50:22] rejoice in God's word is restored faith
[1:50:26] has been
[1:50:27] restored somebody's winning the the
[1:50:30] greatest battle ever fought are there
[1:50:34] people in this room losing that battle
[1:50:36] Yeah for now come
[1:50:40] on you know it's a it's not just a a a
[1:50:43] war is made up a lot of battles you
[1:50:46] don't win every
[1:50:48] battle but you're going to win the war
[1:50:50] if you abide in him and his word abides
[1:50:53] in you so you win some mind battles and
[1:50:56] you lose some mind battles at times and
[1:50:58] then they come back around and this time
[1:51:00] you win it's just a it's just an e and a
[1:51:03] flow and an inward struggle to overcome
[1:51:06] in all things but you will if you
[1:51:09] persevere you will if you push you will
[1:51:13] if you

[1:51:25] striving pushing
[1:51:27] through I want you to know there's
[1:51:29] somebody in this room right now that's
[1:51:31] winning the greatest battle ever fought
[1:51:34] somebody sitting here this morning is
[1:51:36] winning it and here's how they're
[1:51:39] winning it because they're letting
[1:51:42] Jesus have the preeminence
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:52] you break out of the expectation that
[1:51:56] you think somebody else has for
[1:52:00] you that's I don't mind grief grief is
[1:52:04] the processing of heart heartache and
[1:52:07] heartbreak and I don't mind that but
[1:52:10] what I despise is to see somebody caught
[1:52:13] up in a Geral
[1:52:16] wheel of
[1:52:20] expectation well I can't laugh at that
[1:52:24] I'm
[1:52:28] grieving well I can't eat that you know
[1:52:31] I can't eat chocolate
[1:52:34] cake you need
[1:52:36] some you don't know what you're
[1:52:41] missing you know I can't wear a red tie
[1:52:46] on that's not
[1:52:49] normal I can't turn the lights on
[1:52:55] you can't sure you can you're caught up
[1:52:59] in trying to figure out what somebody
[1:53:02] else is expecting of
[1:53:05] you that's not right that's not of God
[1:53:09] grief is of god it's a part of an
[1:53:13] emotion that is given to us to help us
[1:53:16] process life but don't you get in that
[1:53:19] well I can't go to a birthday party come
[1:53:21] on now
[1:53:24] why do you live in the Dark Ages you're
[1:53:26] going to wear black for a
[1:53:28] year I don't care if you grieve it's
[1:53:31] okay but you but look if if you wake up
[1:53:35] and want to wear
[1:53:37] purple we're not living in Victorian
[1:53:42] days sir it's the expectation of a
[1:53:46] society that's going to hell in a hand
[1:53:49] basket you really care what they think
[1:53:52] about how you
[1:53:56] grieve hallu well I can't have a
[1:53:59] Thanksgiving come on now I can't have a
[1:54:02] thanks yes you
[1:54:05] can because you've gotten so
[1:54:11] much look folks this is the example
[1:54:14] that's being lived before you it's not
[1:54:17] the preacher it's what we see
[1:54:19] demonstrated to us every time we come to
[1:54:22] the house of God when somebody brings a
[1:54:25] praise not because everything is all
[1:54:31] right but if he has the
[1:54:39] preeminence why the Bible tells us when
[1:54:41] we fast we shouldn't have a long
[1:54:46] face we should wash our face and anoint
[1:54:49] our head with oil and go about our life
[1:54:51] as though we were eating Sumptuous meals
[1:54:54] so that no one knows what's going
[1:54:56] on don't let your right hand know what
[1:54:59] your left hand's doing you're fasting
[1:55:00] unto God not
[1:55:04] people people quit trimming
[1:55:07] shaving quit brushing their
[1:55:10] teeth while they're
[1:55:12] fasting no
[1:55:15] shower no deal no
[1:55:18] Mom anybody old enough to know what mum
[1:55:21] is
[1:55:24] Megan does I guess that's Megan over
[1:55:29] there it's a brand it used to be a brand
[1:55:31] of deodor and antiperspirant kind like a
[1:55:35] cream I'm fasting I oh by all means
[1:55:39] because when you're fasting all those
[1:55:41] toxins start coming out of your body I
[1:55:44] don't particularly need to smell them I
[1:55:47] can't I can't comb my hair I'm fasting
[1:55:49] come on
[1:55:50] folks that means you just want somebody
[1:55:52] to know what you're doing that's not the
[1:55:55] way we do this the Lord Jesus must have
[1:55:57] preeminence in all things you just keep
[1:56:00] him you just do what I saw today I saw
[1:56:02] people who are hurting
[1:56:04] praising I saw people who've got
[1:56:06] problems praising I see people who are
[1:56:09] under attack praising why because
[1:56:12] somebody here is winning the greatest
[1:56:15] battle ever fought minute by minute by
[1:56:20] minute by minute
[1:56:22] [Applause]
[1:56:26] not because we're superheroes or above
[1:56:29] humans but because we found the key the
[1:56:33] answer is in the
[1:56:34] word that he might have
[1:56:40] preeminence in all
[1:56:46] things excuse me excuse me pardon me
[1:56:50] praise God
[1:56:54] I better not smile somebody will think I
[1:56:56] don't feel it not not feeling the depth
[1:56:59] of
[1:57:02] the oh my
[1:57:05] goodness don't let it somebody else
[1:57:07] judge where you are just put Jesus up
[1:57:12] there let me tell you something there's
[1:57:14] so much I want to tell you but I better
[1:57:17] move on
[1:57:18] here he said I I
[1:57:20] believe every everything sitting
[1:57:22] straight in order for that the token and
[1:57:25] I believe that we
[1:57:30] now we are now at the time that the word
[1:57:38] yes should have
[1:57:49] preeminence not stories
[1:57:52] the
[1:57:53] word the word the word the
[1:57:56] word the
[1:57:58] absolute it's the anchor that's what
[1:58:01] holds us and he said and I I believe
[1:58:04] that the time to lay aside our
[1:58:11] Creeds and our thoughts that time is
[1:58:14] here and and and we've got to do what
[1:58:18] come
[1:58:20] back this is 11 2863 seals are loosed
[1:58:25] word
[1:58:26] restored and we're still people still
[1:58:28] living in Creeds and in their thoughts
[1:58:32] there are people around this truth that
[1:58:34] have traded denominational Creeds
[1:58:37] manmade denominational Creeds for for
[1:58:40] man-made message
[1:58:48] Creeds so that brother brandham can have
[1:58:51] the pre
[1:58:52] or this is not where we
[1:58:56] are we are in an hour where we can now
[1:59:00] put the word and Christ as the center of
[1:59:04] all things we are not making
[1:59:07] addendums to the word we're we're not
[1:59:10] making footnotes we're not adding to it
[1:59:13] don't add to the word or take away from
[1:59:16] the word if you make a prophet say
[1:59:19] something that doesn't line up with the
[1:59:21] word you make him a false
[1:59:27] prophet brother brandom said to brother
[1:59:30] green if I let that church age book
[1:59:32] stand as it
[1:59:33] is it would make me anti-
[1:59:40] word it says things in there that I
[1:59:44] can't find in the word that's what he
[1:59:48] said should we burn it no he said we'll
[1:59:52] corrected in the next Edition we should
[1:59:54] never assume not even prophetic people
[1:59:57] we should never assume that there'll be
[1:59:59] a next
[2:00:04] Edition there are things that must be
[2:00:07] corrected now yes or there will be a
[2:00:10] group of people still holding on to new
[2:00:13] Creeds and man-made thoughts instead of
[2:00:16] coming back to the
[2:00:18] absolute of the word every time you say
[2:00:21] something like that people are just sure
[2:00:23] you're trying to take away remember a
[2:00:26] moment ago you're not taking away from
[2:00:28] the father when you say that in the Sun
[2:00:30] the fullness of the godhead dwelt bodily
[2:00:33] you're not taking away from the message
[2:00:35] of the hour or from the prophet brother
[2:00:37] brandom when you say that Jesus should
[2:00:39] be the preeminent one Among
[2:00:44] Us you're not pulling him down so that
[2:00:46] you can lift Jesus up you're just
[2:00:48] lifting Jesus up and everybody else has
[2:00:51] to find their right ful position by the
[2:00:53] way the ground is
[2:00:55] level the brandom said there's no big
[2:00:57] guys around
[2:01:00] here he said we're all just brothers sir
[2:01:03] there's no great big brothers and little
[2:01:05] bitty Brothers we're just all Brothers
[2:01:08] don't you start looking at man as a big
[2:01:10] man no sir he's a little man that serves
[2:01:15] a big God Jesus have the preeminence is
[2:01:19] that all right well we got to move move
[2:01:23] on same uh uh back to Christ is a
[2:01:26] mystery of God revealed beginning in
[2:01:28] paragraph 371 this is powerful powerful
[2:01:32] words here he said
[2:01:34] no the fullness of godhead is made known
[2:01:38] The Secret of mystery is now revealed
[2:01:42] that God is
[2:01:45] manifested God and
[2:01:49] man become one
[2:01:52] the anointed
[2:01:54] man
[2:01:56] Christ you see those who were beginning
[2:02:00] in the 50s and 60s to understand the
[2:02:03] true deity of Jesus Christ they still
[2:02:06] believe that he was 50% man and 50%
[2:02:11] God the Assemblies of God the Church of
[2:02:14] God the major Mainline Pentecostal
[2:02:17] denominations of the 50s and 60s were
[2:02:20] teaching their Ministry
[2:02:22] that he was God man but that he would
[2:02:26] have been 50% man and 50%
[2:02:30] God I I I think that's dangerous to try
[2:02:34] to figure out which is
[2:02:37] which brother brandom said no he's 100%
[2:02:41] God and 100% man and he could draw on
[2:02:46] his Humanity when he needed
[2:02:49] to he slept
[2:02:52] God don't have to sleep neither Slumbers
[2:02:54] nor sleeps but man did 100% man
[2:02:59] slept but then the storm Rose oh ye of
[2:03:02] little faith he wakes up the disciples
[2:03:04] about to panic about to about to go into
[2:03:07] anxiety attack all ye of little faith
[2:03:10] and he gets up and speaks to the wind
[2:03:11] and the wave puts his foot on the bow of
[2:03:13] the boat and says peace be still that
[2:03:16] wasn't
[2:03:17] man he was drawing on the deity then
[2:03:21] that was 100% God that said peace be
[2:03:25] still it
[2:03:27] matters because we have a pattern
[2:03:30] son Jesus
[2:03:32] hello Jesus was the pattern
[2:03:39] son somebody said well when they made
[2:03:41] him they broke the mold no no no no no
[2:03:45] God made him and recorded the
[2:03:48] mold because there must be many sons
[2:03:53] not many
[2:03:54] jesuses many
[2:03:56] sons all of creation
[2:04:01] granth
[2:04:02] travaileth for the manifestation of sons
[2:04:05] of
[2:04:06] God who rise up with some creative
[2:04:10] Authority you know it's it's it's not
[2:04:13] really more
[2:04:15] power it's authority to do with the
[2:04:18] power that we have because Jesus said
[2:04:21] you'll be in endued with power ter in
[2:04:22] Jerusalem you'll be endued with power
[2:04:24] behold I give you power over all the
[2:04:27] powers of the enemy you you can't have
[2:04:29] more power than all the power if you're
[2:04:31] a true disciple of Jesus Christ filled
[2:04:33] with the Holy Spirit washed and
[2:04:34] Sanctified by the word you've already
[2:04:36] been given the full endowment of power
[2:04:39] but you don't know what to do with it
[2:04:41] because it's only through sunship it's
[2:04:43] only through full adoption that we begin
[2:04:46] to understand the authority that's given
[2:04:47] to us as Sons to answer with the word
[2:04:51] instead of our
[2:04:53] emotion the enemy is asking a bunch of
[2:04:55] questions and if you answer with your
[2:04:57] emotion sir he's going to tie you up and
[2:05:00] Tangle you up in your own thoughts but
[2:05:03] if you answer with the word he doesn't
[2:05:05] know what to do with
[2:05:07] you right I don't mean just dry quoting
[2:05:11] scripture I mean let that Living Word
[2:05:14] rise up in you and talk to him and then
[2:05:16] he says Whoa here's somebody here's a
[2:05:19] son that knows what to do with the power
[2:05:22] as long as the church doesn't know what
[2:05:23] to do with the power it's like a wasted
[2:05:27] commodity but when sunship becomes our
[2:05:30] understanding by Revelation then we know
[2:05:33] who we are because of whose we
[2:05:35] are and we begin to have confidence in
[2:05:38] the god who's living inside of us and we
[2:05:40] begin to understand that the mystery was
[2:05:44] always to be
[2:05:46] always to be Christ in you amen glory
[2:05:54] the hope of glory somebody said well if
[2:05:55] everybody knows that it's not a mystery
[2:05:57] everybody doesn't know it most people
[2:06:00] say it but they don't know it it's
[2:06:04] different it's not just having some
[2:06:05] little small deposit of a spirit in you
[2:06:07] and now I'm I'm I it's Christ in me no
[2:06:10] no no what house will you build me I'm
[2:06:13] not looking for a tent anymore I'm not
[2:06:15] looking for a tabernacle anymore I'm not
[2:06:17] looking for a for a wood and and Stone
[2:06:20] Temple anymore I'm looking for a
[2:06:22] tripartate man I'm looking for one who
[2:06:25] will yield himself Body Soul and
[2:06:29] Spirit to become an anointed man and an
[2:06:33] anointed woman and I want you to know
[2:06:35] that while you are tossing in the sea of
[2:06:37] Life somebody in the
[2:06:40] house is winning the
[2:06:43] battle yes sir you must not be jealous
[2:06:47] you must Rejoice for them and follow
[2:06:51] their examp
[2:06:54] example know the fullness of God that it
[2:06:57] is made known The Secret of mystery now
[2:06:58] revealed that God is Manifest God and
[2:07:00] man become one are you still here the
[2:07:03] anointed man Christ what does Christ
[2:07:05] mean the anointed one the anointed that
[2:07:08] was anointed with the fullness of the
[2:07:13] godhead bodily oh
[2:07:16] my how can people do that doubt that
[2:07:20] remember he had it without measure the
[2:07:23] only way you and I have it without
[2:07:25] measure is to come
[2:07:27] together
[2:07:31] sir putting the pillar of fire back
[2:07:34] together it appeared as clothing tongues
[2:07:36] of fire sat on all of their heads
[2:07:38] everyone receiving a deposit of the
[2:07:40] fullness of the godhead that's what Holy
[2:07:42] Ghost is but in order for us to have
[2:07:45] full measure we got to come together
[2:07:47] that's why it's unifying time that's why
[2:07:49] it's uniting time that's why the bride
[2:07:51] is coming together maybe not all
[2:07:54] geographically but she's coming together
[2:07:56] under a revelation yes sir so we're
[2:07:59] putting the fire back together
[2:08:02] Hallelujah and then what does the church
[2:08:04] have Christ in
[2:08:07] you
[2:08:09] sir the hope of
[2:08:13] glory isn't God good all right let's go
[2:08:17] on uh uh the anointed that was anointed
[2:08:20] with the fullness of godhead B how can
[2:08:22] people doubt it where once
[2:08:26] partly Moses had
[2:08:28] him partly David had him oh my but here
[2:08:32] he is manifested in the fullness deity
[2:08:41] himself in the beginning was a word the
[2:08:43] word was with God the Word was God and
[2:08:44] the word became flesh and dwelt among us
[2:08:46] and we beheld his glory the glory as of
[2:08:48] the only begotten of the father full of
[2:08:49] grace and truth that's the the fullness
[2:08:51] of God it pleased the father don't you
[2:08:55] ever forget that it didn't disappoint
[2:08:57] the father for Jesus to have
[2:09:01] preeminence it didn't disappoint John
[2:09:04] the
[2:09:06] Baptist for Jesus to
[2:09:09] increase while he was
[2:09:13] decreasing you want to carry that a
[2:09:15] little further in your
[2:09:17] mind let's go
[2:09:19] on God in fullness to die for the sin of
[2:09:23] the people that he might bring to his
[2:09:25] church
[2:09:28] what I hope everyone's hearing this
[2:09:31] there's quite a few people out missing
[2:09:33] from the sanctuary right now I hope
[2:09:35] you're hearing
[2:09:39] this because you need
[2:09:42] this to bring to his church a Sanctified
[2:09:46] life that he might have the preeminence
[2:09:50] in full
[2:09:52] in his church to manifest every promise
[2:09:56] in these last days that he promised for
[2:10:01] the last days see he said listen now are
[2:10:04] you now just pinch yourself a little now
[2:10:07] watch come on pinch
[2:10:09] yourself what was Jesus manifested for
[2:10:12] to show God he was God he had to be no
[2:10:16] man could die no Prophet could die he
[2:10:18] was God he was the god of the prophets
[2:10:21] he was the prophets he was the Kings he
[2:10:27] was the history he was he he was he that
[2:10:32] was to come he that was he that is he
[2:10:37] that's to be in this day the same
[2:10:40] yesterday today and forever he was
[2:10:45] manifested for that
[2:10:47] purpose praise His name praise His name
[2:10:51] and through that
[2:10:53] purpose he achieved a
[2:10:55] church that he the fullness of God might
[2:10:59] bring to P oh my
[2:11:05] goodness come
[2:11:07] on every
[2:11:12] promised every promised word of God in
[2:11:16] these last days he gets
[2:11:21] yes sir you know my spell check doesn't
[2:11:25] like brother bram's pluralization of
[2:11:30] preeminence it keeps wanting to correct
[2:11:32] it I refuse to let it because I get
[2:11:36] it you see I have to give him the
[2:11:39] preeminence and you have to give him the
[2:11:41] preeminence and you have to give him pre
[2:11:44] and you have to make him Lord of Lord
[2:11:47] and give him preeminence and then in
[2:11:49] this church this Universal bride church
[2:11:54] he has the
[2:12:21] he gets the preeminence his preeminence
[2:12:23] in the church the position his
[2:12:26] place you know th this is what sunship
[2:12:29] and adoption is about it's about
[2:12:35] position Pentecost understood the
[2:12:39] filling but they didn't understand the
[2:12:43] positioning they didn't understand what
[2:12:46] full adoption looks like that releases
[2:12:49] The Authority when a son is properly
[2:12:53] placed when a son is properly positioned
[2:12:58] you can't be properly placed or
[2:13:00] positioned if you're floating on a bed
[2:13:02] of
[2:13:08] ease cushions cushions and rose
[2:13:12] petals don't position
[2:13:15] Suns
[2:13:17] battles
[2:13:18] blood bullets
[2:13:21] sweat
[2:13:24] spit
[2:13:28] trenches that's what
[2:13:30] positions places Sons I need something a
[2:13:34] spray or something for my throat please
[2:13:37] that's what places and positions
[2:13:40] Sons it's
[2:13:43] battle it's a battlefield
[2:13:46] brother this is not a picnic hello
[2:13:51] we don't get to choose our our
[2:13:54] class this is God sees us amen thank you
[2:13:59] so much I me just try I've got
[2:14:08] to Jesus said he that believeth on me
[2:14:12] the works that I do shall he also even
[2:14:14] more than this shall he do for I go to
[2:14:16] my father see that was his
[2:14:19] purpose there was the manifestation and
[2:14:22] now today he wants to get somebody that
[2:14:25] can so see
[2:14:29] it the first step is you got to see
[2:14:33] it that they can let the word that's
[2:14:37] yield to it you've got to see it first
[2:14:41] then you've got to yield to it let the
[2:14:45] word he said see Jesus so seen it so
[2:14:51] was so perfectly born for the day until
[2:14:55] God expressed every move that he made he
[2:14:59] Jesus was God's
[2:15:02] revelation
[2:15:04] God revealed last paragraph
[2:15:07] now he Sanctified with his spirit and
[2:15:11] blood a church that he might make every
[2:15:15] promise in this last day be revealed now
[2:15:18] that's every
[2:15:19] promise now this little bride has some
[2:15:22] promises that have not yet
[2:15:25] been
[2:15:27] fulfilled maybe even
[2:15:33] revealed there are some
[2:15:37] pieces I
[2:15:40] I the hardest thing for a minister is
[2:15:44] to be burning with a
[2:15:47] subject and unable to preach
[2:15:52] it but I'm
[2:15:54] burning I I spent about 10 hours
[2:15:58] yesterday studying or something that I I
[2:16:02] can't even preach this
[2:16:04] morning but it's a
[2:16:07] key for where to
[2:16:09] place some things that have
[2:16:13] been
[2:16:15] misplaced if you put everything behind
[2:16:18] us and that's what they've done now
[2:16:25] I I I I just marvel can I just will you
[2:16:28] indulge me just a minute I just marvel
[2:16:32] when I hear them
[2:16:33] preaching uh we know what the
[2:16:36] Thunders
[2:16:39] are I
[2:16:44] Marvel because it must be so holy and so
[2:16:48] precious they can't tell any of us
[2:16:53] cuz you you may get by
[2:16:55] some saying you know them but you're not
[2:16:57] going to get by everybody because
[2:16:59] there's some of us that are going to
[2:17:00] want to know well what did they
[2:17:05] say he said they weren't even
[2:17:09] written he placed them over and over
[2:17:12] again he backed off that just slightly
[2:17:15] toward the end but he placed them over
[2:17:18] and over again on the back side
[2:17:24] died he he he made a just a little
[2:17:26] adjustment toward the end of that of
[2:17:28] that
[2:17:33] thought I think I know even
[2:17:41] why if we
[2:17:43] knew we could be out of
[2:17:48] here but it's a promise
[2:17:51] it'll take those it'll take
[2:17:54] them the bride has never had a Revival
[2:17:57] yet third
[2:17:59] seal it'll take that well then when you
[2:18:02] come along and tell us we know what it
[2:18:05] is then I'm going to need to see the
[2:18:08] proof of the spoken word Revival that is
[2:18:10] to follow because when that Revival
[2:18:13] comes it comes with creative
[2:18:15] power I'm looking for the full I'm not
[2:18:18] looking for a dozen testimonies
[2:18:23] to settle a whole
[2:18:26] mystery I'm looking for an
[2:18:30] army to rise
[2:18:32] up and to properly place the word and
[2:18:36] watch this thing produce Christ and then
[2:18:40] take us out of here are you with
[2:18:43] me if I hear a prophet say I do not know
[2:18:48] what it was I do not know what it is we
[2:18:54] don't know it was not permitted for us
[2:18:58] to
[2:19:02] know we have the revelation of the
[2:19:07] six but I do not know I could not make
[2:19:12] it
[2:19:15] out then I have to believe that there
[2:19:18] are yet promises
[2:19:20] that have not yet been revealed fully
[2:19:24] and fulfilled in the bride
[2:19:30] body he
[2:19:32] says at the end of the seventh
[2:19:35] seal it's not time for it
[2:19:44] yet I I'm hanging on to yet
[2:19:52] when it comes it'll come like a Roman
[2:19:54] Candle it'll
[2:19:57] come you say who hey here we
[2:20:03] are but if you keep putting things
[2:20:06] behind this has happened this has
[2:20:08] happened this has happened this has
[2:20:09] happened there's nothing to reach
[2:20:12] for then you're going to have to start
[2:20:14] explaining why uh that this bride church
[2:20:17] is becoming sicker instead of more well
[2:20:21] amen and nobody's going to want to face
[2:20:23] the reality of that it's simply because
[2:20:26] we won't have the fullness of that until
[2:20:28] we win this mind battle I need you to
[2:20:31] know there's somebody here that's
[2:20:33] winning the
[2:20:35] battle and you know what that means it
[2:20:37] means you can
[2:20:40] too if one does that's right God loves
[2:20:45] him more no come on now God loves her
[2:20:48] more no no sir he doesn't love any of us
[2:20:52] more than the rest of us that's right
[2:20:55] but we have to apply what we already
[2:20:57] have what we already know before we can
[2:21:00] reach in faith for what we have not yet
[2:21:03] seen manifested among that's all I want
[2:21:05] to say on that
[2:21:11] subject but he is one of these Glorious
[2:21:14] Days going to put one foot on land and
[2:21:17] sea
[2:21:21] no doubt about
[2:21:22] it he Sanctified with his spirit and
[2:21:25] blood a church that he might make every
[2:21:28] promise in this last day be revealed now
[2:21:31] see he could go back and pick up what
[2:21:34] these other fellows have left off here
[2:21:36] he's talking about the reformers of the
[2:21:38] other Church ages in the last days and
[2:21:40] by his and by his holy spirit revealed
[2:21:44] all the
[2:21:47] mystery of the seven
[2:21:53] seals he's putting them all in this
[2:21:56] subject Seven
[2:21:59] Seals that's what he's doing see he is
[2:22:03] expressing himself that's his purpose
[2:22:06] that's why he died that's the second
[2:22:10] fold of his three-fold
[2:22:13] manifestation now watch this
[2:22:17] first to express hisself in Christ
[2:22:22] then Express himself through the
[2:22:28] church and then establish the kingdom he
[2:22:31] doesn't get to the third one in this
[2:22:33] paragraph Christ was the
[2:22:36] word he said first to express himself in
[2:22:40] Christ then Express himself through the
[2:22:41] church and the same thing Christ was the
[2:22:43] word and the church becomes the word
[2:22:46] when it lets the word
[2:22:53] it's not how much of the word you go
[2:22:55] through it's how much of God's word goes
[2:22:58] through
[2:22:59] you you read it all day long hear it
[2:23:02] preached all day long and if you start
[2:23:04] putting that on other people and
[2:23:06] disqualifying
[2:23:08] yourself you'll never be changed you're
[2:23:11] going to have to raise up we're going to
[2:23:13] have to raise up in every moment and say
[2:23:15] that's mine that's mine that's our
[2:23:17] Christ not Christ in you
[2:23:23] only Christ in
[2:23:25] me the hope of
[2:23:28] glory if he's going to be the hope of
[2:23:30] glory in anybody he's going to be the
[2:23:32] hope of glory in
[2:23:35] me you you personalize This
[2:23:38] Promise one more thing and then we're
[2:23:40] going to we're going to shift into
[2:23:42] something that I think is going to bless
[2:23:44] you Christ is a mystery of God one more
[2:23:47] I'm skipping 388 and 380 I want to go to
[2:23:50] one 154 so we get all three things to
[2:23:52] take home with us first to express
[2:23:55] itself completely God in
[2:23:59] Christ that is the the mystery Christ is
[2:24:03] the mystery of God
[2:24:07] revealed first to express your
[2:24:10] completely God in Christ second to have
[2:24:14] the
[2:24:14] pinenes by this in his church which is
[2:24:18] his body the bride till he could have
[2:24:22] the preeminence to express
[2:24:28] himself through them that
[2:24:32] is
[2:24:35] US Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[2:24:38] the bride church is the mystery of
[2:24:40] Christ
[2:24:41] revealed now how can you say something
[2:24:43] like that because he said all that the
[2:24:45] father
[2:24:48] was so I have no problem saying Christ
[2:24:51] is the mystery of God revealed the bride
[2:24:54] church is the mystery of Christ revealed
[2:24:56] now let's get that settled and and go
[2:24:59] home not to
[2:25:03] 888 let's go back to our Heavenly home
[2:25:05] let's get out of here I'm ready I'm
[2:25:07] anybody ready to go I no no need to hang
[2:25:10] around if we can get this thing right
[2:25:13] and then
[2:25:14] thirdly to restore the kingdom
[2:25:21] somebody said what what kingdom which
[2:25:22] kingdom what does the Kingdom look like
[2:25:24] well let's go all the way back to the
[2:25:25] Garden of Eden first and then all the
[2:25:28] way back to the beginning before the
[2:25:29] Garden of Eden we'll get a glimpse of
[2:25:31] the Kingdom we'll understand through the
[2:25:33] words of our Lord Jesus what the kingdom
[2:25:35] is to be it's not to be a geographical
[2:25:38] place it's to be an established throne
[2:25:42] in the heart of his people this is where
[2:25:45] his kingdom is we are his subjects he
[2:25:48] must have preeminence in us he must have
[2:25:52] have dominion we must give him
[2:25:55] lordship over our lives Amen in every
[2:26:01] area holy spirit says don't do that
[2:26:03] don't do
[2:26:05] it but but I did it last year and it
[2:26:07] didn't bother
[2:26:09] me it's different
[2:26:11] now it's different
[2:26:14] now it's different now the holy spirit
[2:26:17] is cleaning he's sanctifying he's doing
[2:26:20] doing something in us thirdly to restore
[2:26:23] the kingdom to its rightly position that
[2:26:25] fell by sin the first Adam back to where
[2:26:28] he walked in the cool of the evening
[2:26:30] with his people talked with them
[2:26:33] fellowshipped underneath the shadow
[2:26:38] Gia I can't stop my wings when you're
[2:26:41] singing something like that my wings
[2:26:43] just want to
[2:26:45] go because that's where I want to live I
[2:26:48] told the Lord as she was singing I want
[2:26:49] to live there I like it so much there
[2:26:53] it's so much better there I want to live
[2:26:55] there under the shadow oh well he's
[2:26:58] light and there is no Shadow you you
[2:27:01] must understand we're getting under
[2:27:05] him meaning he has
[2:27:07] preeminence if you're under him then
[2:27:09] you're in his
[2:27:11] shadow
[2:27:13] hello Peter understood the
[2:27:17] concept such as I have
[2:27:22] Christ in me the hope of glory such as I
[2:27:26] have now in in in in closing this
[2:27:30] service and shifting here just a
[2:27:32] moment for something
[2:27:35] interesting if Christ is going to have
[2:27:38] the preeminence the first place the main
[2:27:42] attraction in our
[2:27:46] lives there are going to be some things
[2:27:48] we have to look away from
[2:27:52] in order to look away to Jesus we're
[2:27:55] going to have to look
[2:27:57] away from some other
[2:28:00] stuff one of them is God has given us
[2:28:05] emotions to serve
[2:28:07] us not to control us I want you to hear
[2:28:11] me
[2:28:13] now to serve
[2:28:17] us our emotions help us us to make
[2:28:22] contact with the world around us and
[2:28:26] with what we experience in life and they
[2:28:29] are to follow our
[2:28:32] lead it's from the spirit man that we
[2:28:35] live our
[2:28:38] life and that is a regenerated Spirit
[2:28:41] that's no longer Fallen Spirit like Adam
[2:28:43] ended up with this one now has been
[2:28:46] infused with the life of Jesus Christ
[2:28:49] it's a reg generated spirit it's
[2:28:52] resurrected with the Life of Christ the
[2:28:55] life that I now live is not my own do
[2:28:57] you follow me and that Spirit man that
[2:29:00] Jesus in my spirit that life of God Zoe
[2:29:04] in my spirit is is to Lead Me outwardly
[2:29:08] from inwardly outwardly so it should
[2:29:12] have dominion over my
[2:29:14] mind my regenerated Spirit now infused
[2:29:17] with the holy spirit of God should have
[2:29:20] iion over my my soul life my mind life
[2:29:25] the soul is mind will and
[2:29:28] emotions so Christ in my spirit
[2:29:32] regenerated new
[2:29:34] spirit Christ in there he should rule
[2:29:39] out my over my mind over my
[2:29:43] will reigning over my
[2:29:46] emotions my emotions are what help
[2:29:48] connect me to my physical physical body
[2:29:51] and the physical body is not my
[2:29:53] enemy it's my house that's all it's not
[2:29:58] the real me it's more in the negative
[2:30:01] than in the
[2:30:03] positive but it's needy it's necessary
[2:30:07] and it's where some of my trouble comes
[2:30:10] from so I've got to have the Holy Spirit
[2:30:14] ruling and reigning from inside outside
[2:30:18] and my emotions have to
[2:30:21] obey what Christ is
[2:30:24] saying on the control tower of my life
[2:30:28] if I'm living any other kind of life I'm
[2:30:30] not living the ascended Christ life I'm
[2:30:33] living a part of carnality a part of
[2:30:36] Earth life and spirit life and that's
[2:30:38] not how God wants his people in the last
[2:30:40] day so we we're working we're working
[2:30:42] toward giving Jesus Christ on the throne
[2:30:46] of our heart full dominion over every
[2:30:48] area of our life that he makes choices
[2:30:51] and we yield to them and he's not going
[2:30:53] to choose death for us he's going to
[2:30:54] choose life for us he's not going to
[2:30:57] choose disease he's going to choose
[2:30:58] health and healing and wholeness are you
[2:31:01] with
[2:31:02] me so if we're going to make Christ
[2:31:05] number one that means we have to make
[2:31:07] some other
[2:31:08] things
[2:31:12] bow and being led by
[2:31:15] anger anger has to Bow being led by
[2:31:19] jealousy and
[2:31:22] Envy that's got to
[2:31:25] Bow and another point that we're facing
[2:31:28] is
[2:31:31] sorrow if we're looking away to Jesus
[2:31:33] then sorrow has to it has to
[2:31:38] Bow because we we don't grieve as those
[2:31:41] who have no hope we grieve as those
[2:31:44] whose hope is I've got more hope for
[2:31:47] that than I do this that's Eternal
[2:31:51] amen RJ had an an amazing
[2:31:57] dream this
[2:31:59] week and I asked him this morning would
[2:32:03] he read it would he share it with
[2:32:06] you and I think that you're going to be
[2:32:10] really
[2:32:11] blessed because to get to where we're
[2:32:14] going like brother Joe was preaching to
[2:32:18] us kicking off the camp
[2:32:22] meeting to get to where we're going we
[2:32:24] have to pick up what we've
[2:32:28] dropped and in order to pick up what
[2:32:30] we've dropped we've got to get past
[2:32:32] anything that's keeping us from running
[2:32:35] on with the vision correct you follow
[2:32:37] that and I think this dream is a key
[2:32:39] would you come brother and I I didn't
[2:32:42] know how we should share it he he wrote
[2:32:46] it amazing but I'm just giving him
[2:32:48] Liberty I'm going over there to sit and
[2:32:50] I'm just giving him Liberty to share uh
[2:32:53] the rest all the time that he needs and
[2:32:56] then and then we'll
[2:33:07] pray all
[2:33:10] right uh let's
[2:33:13] see just please bear with
[2:33:17] me so I I titled this
[2:33:20] Beyond
[2:33:21] sorrow unclaimed mantles for a rising
[2:33:26] Generation Um I will read the dream and
[2:33:30] then I felt like the lord gave me an
[2:33:32] interpretation to the dream so I'll read
[2:33:34] that as
[2:33:36] well uh this was given in early in the
[2:33:39] morning um October 27th
[2:33:43] 2024 I stood in the vestibule of New
[2:33:46] Hope Revival ministries G gazing through
[2:33:49] the open doors into the sanctuary where
[2:33:52] worship was transitioning into
[2:33:55] prayer brother Wesley gy stood behind
[2:33:58] the pulpit beginning to lead the
[2:34:02] congregation the sanctuary was filled
[2:34:04] with an extraordinary light what those
[2:34:07] familiar with prophetic encounters might
[2:34:10] recognize as the cusp of visible Glory
[2:34:14] that milky white atmosphere that
[2:34:16] sometimes accompanies God's manifest
[2:34:18] presence yes in this moment of intense
[2:34:22] light I felt an inexplicable need to
[2:34:26] change my
[2:34:27] clothes though what I wore though what I
[2:34:30] was wearing wasn't visibly soiled the
[2:34:34] impulse was clear and
[2:34:37] compelling stepping through a doorway I
[2:34:39] entered what appeared to be a bathroom
[2:34:41] though it felt more like a locker room a
[2:34:44] dimmer space with traditional fixtures
[2:34:47] but room enough to change privately
[2:34:51] the space was notably darker than the
[2:34:53] sanctuary with old tile floors and an
[2:34:56] unused quality about it though not
[2:34:58] ominously
[2:35:00] so in the back right corner of this room
[2:35:03] I noticed a small unlit door without
[2:35:07] conscious thought or curiosity I was
[2:35:10] drawn to it the door was almost hidden
[2:35:14] unadorned yet I walked directly to it
[2:35:17] pushed it open and stepped through
[2:35:21] I emerged in what appeared to be an
[2:35:23] abandoned department store it was
[2:35:25] reminiscent of a Dillards in a mall the
[2:35:29] space stretched across multiple floors
[2:35:32] with at least two levels visible and a
[2:35:35] large spiral staircase Rising through
[2:35:37] the
[2:35:38] center endless circular racks of clothes
[2:35:42] extended wall to wall suit jackets
[2:35:46] Formal Wear and business attire all
[2:35:49] covered in years of undisturbed
[2:35:53] dust the air hung the the air hung stale
[2:35:58] speaking of Decades of
[2:36:01] Abandonment
[2:36:10] sorry near the front of the store to my
[2:36:13] left sat a solid wood desk positioned
[2:36:17] like a reception area though it faced
[2:36:20] the left wall rather than the entrance a
[2:36:23] small gold table lamp cast weak light
[2:36:26] into the shadowed
[2:36:28] space behind the desk sat an imposing
[2:36:32] figure a tall broad shouldered man
[2:36:36] standing perhaps s feet or taller with
[2:36:40] striking blonde hair and strong handsome
[2:36:44] features he possessed an Angelic quality
[2:36:48] objectively beautiful in
[2:36:50] form yet he noticeably lacked the
[2:36:52] radiance that emanates from one that
[2:36:55] carries the glory of
[2:36:57] God when he noticed me he stood and
[2:37:01] turned instantly I found myself before
[2:37:04] him who are you I
[2:37:07] asked my name is sorrow he leaned and
[2:37:10] whispered near my ear in that moment I I
[2:37:14] knew instinctively and immediately that
[2:37:17] I was in a spiritual battle this being
[2:37:20] intended my
[2:37:21] destruction a wave of adrenaline hit me
[2:37:24] as I impulsively Drew back from his
[2:37:26] presence he wielded a hammer first then
[2:37:30] created a dark Vortex of weapons axes
[2:37:33] and other implements hurled towards me
[2:37:35] with lethal intent though these weapons
[2:37:38] seem physical they Carri deeper
[2:37:40] spiritual
[2:37:42] significance as I retreated towards the
[2:37:44] door through which I had entered I
[2:37:46] discovered that sister Stacy and several
[2:37:49] Young young children perhaps four or
[2:37:51] five of them had followed in app
[2:37:54] apparently curious to see what I had
[2:37:56] discovered in this mysterious
[2:37:58] space my focus shifted entirely to
[2:38:01] getting everyone to safety and though I
[2:38:03] couldn't see it at the time I was being
[2:38:05] divinely I was being divinely shielded
[2:38:08] from sorrow's
[2:38:09] attacks while I offered spiritual
[2:38:12] resistance not through physical combat
[2:38:15] but through an intentional standing
[2:38:17] against his assaults in will emotion and
[2:38:20] spirit we fled back through the small
[2:38:23] door and the dream
[2:38:30] ended in the realm of prophetic dreams
[2:38:33] so here's my interpretation uh in the
[2:38:35] realm of prophetic dreams spaces often
[2:38:39] speak deeper truths than words alone can
[2:38:42] convey this journey began in a place of
[2:38:45] corporate worship where the tangible
[2:38:47] presence of God filled our church with
[2:38:49] an almost visible
[2:38:51] Glory this starting point is
[2:38:54] significant it was the atmosphere of
[2:38:56] worship as brother gy began to lead the
[2:38:59] congregation in prayer that the veil
[2:39:01] between the natural and spiritual began
[2:39:03] to
[2:39:04] thin the first stirring of spiritual
[2:39:06] significance came with an inexplicable
[2:39:09] need to change clothes this wasn't about
[2:39:12] physical garments but spoke to a deeper
[2:39:15] truth rooted in biblical tradition just
[2:39:18] as priests in the old Testament would
[2:39:20] change their garments based on their
[2:39:22] service and as Joshua the high priest
[2:39:24] received new clothes in Zechariah 3 this
[2:39:28] impulse pointed to a season of increased
[2:39:31] sanctification and Spiritual Authority
[2:39:34] it was a Divine indication that the
[2:39:37] current spiritual garments though not
[2:39:40] necessarily defiled were insufficient
[2:39:42] for the next season of
[2:39:44] ministry the transition through the
[2:39:47] bathroom locker room space carries its
[2:39:49] own
[2:39:50] significance in prophetic symbolism such
[2:39:53] spaces of such spaces often represent
[2:39:56] cleansing and preparation yes the
[2:39:59] washing of the Water by the word amen
[2:40:02] though dimmer than the sanctuary this
[2:40:04] space wasn't forboding but rather
[2:40:06] Preparatory and intimate a necessary
[2:40:10] transition point between present
[2:40:12] experience and future
[2:40:14] inheritance the discovery of the hidden
[2:40:17] unadorned door in the back corner speaks
[2:40:20] to how God often conceals profound
[2:40:22] spiritual Treasures in overlooked places
[2:40:26] the drawing to this door wasn't born of
[2:40:28] curiosity but of divine leading a
[2:40:31] principle we see throughout scripture
[2:40:33] where God's most significant Revelations
[2:40:36] often come through humble
[2:40:38] passages the abandoned department store
[2:40:41] with its vast collection of formal
[2:40:43] attire spread across multiple floors
[2:40:47] representing something profound a
[2:40:49] reservoir of spiritual mantel and
[2:40:52] Authority that God has preserved for
[2:40:55] this
[2:40:56] generation these aren't casual garments
[2:40:58] but Formal Wear about my father's
[2:41:01] business kind of attire speaking to the
[2:41:04] dignity and gravity of the Spiritual
[2:41:06] Authority they
[2:41:08] represent the dust covering these
[2:41:10] garments tells a story of inheritance
[2:41:13] temporarily forgotten but not diminished
[2:41:16] in power or
[2:41:17] significance the Pres of Sorrow that
[2:41:20] imposing almost beautiful figure reveals
[2:41:24] a crucial
[2:41:27] truth about spiritual advancement yes
[2:41:30] here stands a territorial principality
[2:41:33] positioned as an unauthorized gatekeeper
[2:41:36] over spiritual inheritance that doesn't
[2:41:38] belong to him his beauty without
[2:41:41] Radiance speaks to how the enemy often
[2:41:43] presents himself impressive but lacking
[2:41:46] True Glory his violent response to to
[2:41:49] Discovery illustrates a pattern we see
[2:41:51] throughout scripture when God's people
[2:41:54] approach their inheritance opposition
[2:41:57] intensifies yet Perhaps most
[2:42:00] significant is the generational Dynamic
[2:42:03] revealed in this encounter yes three
[2:42:06] distinct Generations were present the
[2:42:08] children representing untarnished faith
[2:42:11] and natural spiritual curiosity the
[2:42:14] middle generation represented by myself
[2:42:17] positioned to both receive and protect
[2:42:20] and the leadership generation
[2:42:22] represented by Stacy in a maternal
[2:42:24] guiding role this wasn't merely about
[2:42:27] individual inheritance but about
[2:42:29] multi-generational transfer of Spiritual
[2:42:32] Authority yes the timing of this dream
[2:42:35] coming in the wake of tragic loss within
[2:42:38] our congregation speaks powerfully to
[2:42:41] God's heart for his
[2:42:43] people e even as sorrow attempts to
[2:42:46] establish his authority through grief
[2:42:48] and loss God reveals a vast Storehouse
[2:42:52] of unclaimed Spiritual Authority
[2:42:54] awaiting his people amen the enemy's
[2:42:57] violent reaction you actually confirms
[2:43:00] the significance of what God has
[2:43:02] prepared this dream serves as both a
[2:43:05] warning and a profound encouragement it
[2:43:08] warns of the enemy's desire to prevent
[2:43:10] God's people from claiming claiming
[2:43:13] their spiritual inheritance through
[2:43:15] intimidation fear and sorrow yet it also
[2:43:18] reveals the the enemy's
[2:43:20] limitations despite his imposing
[2:43:22] presence he could neither prevent the
[2:43:25] discovery of these mantel nor
[2:43:26] successfully attack when met with
[2:43:29] spiritual
[2:43:30] resistance the call emerging from this
[2:43:32] dream is clear there is a corporate
[2:43:35] destiny that requires multi-generational
[2:43:39] participation the younger generation's
[2:43:41] Natural Curiosity toward spiritual
[2:43:43] things the middle generation's
[2:43:45] responsibility to both claim and protect
[2:43:48] and the leadership generation's role and
[2:43:51] guiding all are crucial for for
[2:43:54] possessing what God has
[2:43:57] prepared the progression is significant
[2:44:00] from corporate worship that creates an
[2:44:02] atmosphere of Glory to individual
[2:44:04] recognition of Need For Greater
[2:44:06] authority to discovery of vast unclaimed
[2:44:09] inheritance to facing an overcoming
[2:44:12] opposition all while protecting multiple
[2:44:15] Generations under Divine covering this
[2:44:18] pattern suggests that advancing into
[2:44:20] greater Spiritual Authority requires
[2:44:22] both individual preparation and
[2:44:24] corporate movement for New Hope Revival
[2:44:27] ministries this dream arrives at a
[2:44:29] critical moment a chyos time between
[2:44:32] deep sorrow and divine inheritance it
[2:44:35] reveals that even in the aftermath of
[2:44:37] tragedy God has preserved something
[2:44:40] magnificent for his people the dust on
[2:44:43] those mantel isn't permanent it's
[2:44:46] waiting to be brushed off by those
[2:44:48] willing to press past opposition to
[2:44:50] claim what God has prepared this is more
[2:44:53] than a dream of personal preparation or
[2:44:56] individual calling it's a vision of
[2:44:58] corporate Destiny of multi-generational
[2:45:01] inheritance of Authority Long abandoned
[2:45:04] but not diminished it's a call to
[2:45:12] recognize that what appears as a place
[2:45:14] of
[2:45:15] Sorrow can actually Mark the threshold
[2:45:18] of claiming in unprecedented Spiritual
[2:45:20] Authority Hallelujah most importantly
[2:45:23] it's an assurance that even in
[2:45:24] confronting profound opposition God's
[2:45:27] people move forward under Divine
[2:45:29] protection carrying not just their own
[2:45:32] inheritance but helping secure it for
[2:45:34] generations to come hallelujah
[2:45:38] hallelujah
[2:45:40] hallelujah tell us what we can
[2:45:47] do what do we do about
[2:45:54] so n
[2:45:56] naturally
[2:46:01] uh you know what so I have God has
[2:46:04] blessed me very much with uh three
[2:46:07] children and uh many of you know when
[2:46:11] you have young kids sleep is uh very
[2:46:14] hard to get and so our house often times
[2:46:17] in the night is a juggle between my wife
[2:46:19] and I um and this night um I found
[2:46:23] myself all my kids were in our bed and I
[2:46:26] was in Enoch's bed by
[2:46:28] myself
[2:46:30] uh
[2:46:32] and you know I I've been serving the
[2:46:35] lord for 15 years now and
[2:46:38] um I have had many different spiritual
[2:46:41] I've had countless spiritual warfare
[2:46:43] dreams in that
[2:46:45] time I almost would have dismissed this
[2:46:50] dream but I had never
[2:46:54] seen an emotion personified in that
[2:46:59] way I don't know how to communicate it
[2:47:02] other than just I experienced it
[2:47:06] um and so then I couldn't get away from
[2:47:09] it and I came here I think we had to
[2:47:11] count the next day and uh I tried to
[2:47:14] secretly kind of tell Hawk and Hawk's
[2:47:16] like hey you need to tell Benjamin and
[2:47:17] so then we just got got into it and uh I
[2:47:21] just started kind of pouring out of it
[2:47:24] like what I had experienced and what I
[2:47:26] thought it was kind of what what I felt
[2:47:28] the Lord was telling me it was meaning
[2:47:31] it
[2:47:35] meant
[2:47:38] um so here is my application for
[2:47:43] me I started I don't want to focus on
[2:47:47] sorrow I I I do feel like he is
[2:47:50] significant I feel like
[2:47:54] that I feel like I feel like forgive me
[2:47:57] if I'm just if I I don't know how to
[2:47:59] speak but to just kind of speak plain
[2:48:01] we're very ignorant of of what's going
[2:48:04] on in the spirit realm I I unless God
[2:48:08] reveals it to us which he wants to and
[2:48:10] he and he
[2:48:12] can so I'm very often ignorant of what
[2:48:15] God is accomplishing in the spirit and
[2:48:18] and I don't don't really think we
[2:48:20] understand what's taking place in the
[2:48:23] realm of the spirit when we're meeting
[2:48:25] here weak after week after week and
[2:48:28] contending for the Manifest glory of God
[2:48:34] Amen we really start stirring things
[2:48:37] up you know the the my so the first
[2:48:42] place I went
[2:48:43] was this this idea it's based out of
[2:48:47] Revelation 12 the Manchild caught up to
[2:48:50] the throne it's when we go up he comes
[2:48:53] down and
[2:48:55] so again I don't want to dwell too much
[2:48:58] on this but it's it's there are I mean I
[2:49:02] kind of quoted in in in my prayer this
[2:49:04] morning he's far above principalities
[2:49:06] Powers the rulers of Darkness of this
[2:49:09] world and spiritual wickedness where in
[2:49:13] high places right it's the same word we
[2:49:16] are seated with Christ where high places
[2:49:19] in high places it's the same word and so
[2:49:21] when we go up and actually rightfully
[2:49:24] occupy that place those things are
[2:49:27] displaced and they come down and if you
[2:49:30] read Revelation 12 they're angry and
[2:49:33] they're upset that's right and if you
[2:49:35] study revivals it happened in church
[2:49:37] history when God was pouring out his
[2:49:40] blessings I think brother brandham said
[2:49:41] it the asylums were filling up and so
[2:49:45] we're ignorant of those things and we
[2:49:47] you know we shouldn't be we need and so
[2:49:50] okay so that's like one so it's like so
[2:49:53] then so then what do I
[2:49:56] do so I went to Revelation 3 I started
[2:50:00] studying
[2:50:01] garments you know like I I was standing
[2:50:04] out in the vestibule I was looking
[2:50:06] through an open door and there was
[2:50:08] visible glory in here and I felt a an
[2:50:11] inexplicable need to change my clothes
[2:50:14] of course I'm all like I start getting I
[2:50:17] get really self-aware when I have a
[2:50:18] dream like that and it's like okay what
[2:50:20] am I doing wrong like evaluating my life
[2:50:23] what can I put right is God is God kind
[2:50:25] of judging me or or whatever but it's
[2:50:29] it's actually what I think that you know
[2:50:32] is kind of expressed in the dream he
[2:50:34] just it's it's not even that my garments
[2:50:37] are soiled but they're insufficient to
[2:50:40] the place that he's calling me
[2:50:42] to and so then I
[2:50:44] started studying garments and I'm not
[2:50:48] you're going to get the abbreviated
[2:50:49] version but I went to the Church of
[2:50:53] leoa Revelation 3 and to the Church of
[2:50:57] leody deia write you know every single
[2:51:01] church he says I know your works every
[2:51:03] single church he says I know your works
[2:51:06] because that's the very first thing that
[2:51:07] we want to present to the Lord is what
[2:51:09] we've done and he kind in some sense
[2:51:12] he's just dismissive I know your works
[2:51:14] but you know so and there's an
[2:51:17] indictment against the church leoda and
[2:51:19] he says I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[2:51:23] tried in the fire that you may be rich
[2:51:26] and white garments to cover the shame of
[2:51:30] your nakedness right and a thought hit
[2:51:34] me garments shame nakedness where have I
[2:51:39] heard that before yeah Genesis
[2:51:43] 3 and so Genesis and Revelation again
[2:51:45] they're tied together and so I went back
[2:51:48] to Genesis 3 and again I'm like I'm
[2:51:53] not this is just for me this is what I
[2:51:55] feel like God has been telling me so you
[2:51:58] have the transgression of Adam and Eve
[2:52:00] in the Garden of
[2:52:01] Eden and God comes down and he says Adam
[2:52:06] where are
[2:52:07] you and Adam says we heard your voice we
[2:52:12] saw that we were naked and we hid
[2:52:14] ourselves
[2:52:16] yes and
[2:52:19] there's one verse that says unto Adam
[2:52:23] and to his wife also the Lord God made
[2:52:27] them coats of
[2:52:29] skins the word made there is the same
[2:52:33] word when it says and the Lord made the
[2:52:37] stars and the Lord made the Earth and
[2:52:41] and the Animals the same care and
[2:52:44] attention that God created the universe
[2:52:48] he gave to these garments that he was
[2:52:51] fashioning for his son and his daughter
[2:52:55] yes
[2:52:59] so there is an offering there are five
[2:53:02] levitical offerings the burnt offering
[2:53:05] the peace offering the meal offering the
[2:53:07] sin offering the trespass offering the
[2:53:10] burnt offering is a very interesting
[2:53:12] offering
[2:53:14] because it's entirely consumed
[2:53:18] save one thing which is the
[2:53:22] skin and so I started
[2:53:25] thinking about like I put myself into
[2:53:28] the story my wife can my wife and my mom
[2:53:31] and Hawk can tell you it's like I I I
[2:53:33] love narrative the power of story do I
[2:53:36] love Doctrine I love theology but but
[2:53:39] there is a kind of an emotion that's why
[2:53:42] I lik writing this dream because it kind
[2:53:44] of brings you into the picture and you
[2:53:45] can see it and so I was living in that
[2:53:49] portion of text and was seeing the logos
[2:53:54] come down searching for his son not
[2:53:58] because he didn't know where he was but
[2:54:01] because Adam didn't know where he was
[2:54:03] where he was he had never been lost
[2:54:05] before he had never known death before
[2:54:10] and his father now
[2:54:12] is transitioning from Creator to priest
[2:54:17] yes and he offers a sacrifice and he
[2:54:21] kills an animal yes that at least typed
[2:54:26] the burnt offering where the offering
[2:54:29] was wholly con consumed saved the skins
[2:54:33] and the Skins were saved for the priest
[2:54:35] and then God used those skins to cover
[2:54:39] his his son and his daughter yes so then
[2:54:41] I started studying the burnt offering
[2:54:44] and the burnt offering it basically it
[2:54:46] it ties into what you were saying today
[2:54:49] like the meat of it is is its entire
[2:54:52] consecration unto God and so you have
[2:54:56] Romans 121 I beseech you therefore
[2:54:58] Brethren by the mercies of God that you
[2:55:00] present yourself as living
[2:55:03] sacrifices this is your spiritual act of
[2:55:05] worship and so I am taking away from
[2:55:08] this dream
[2:55:10] that you know we are getting through yes
[2:55:15] you know we are we are we are changing
[2:55:18] Ing and shifting something in in in the
[2:55:21] realm of the spirit in the heavens you
[2:55:23] know it it is Progressive it's it's not
[2:55:27] instantaneous and that is the goodness
[2:55:29] of God because if God were to fully
[2:55:32] manifest himself fully to us right now I
[2:55:36] wouldn't be you might be alive but I
[2:55:38] wouldn't be alive and so it's it's it's
[2:55:42] it's from glory to glory from glory to
[2:55:44] glory and so for me I feel like uh it's
[2:55:48] a season of Consecration and obedience
[2:55:52] Hebrews says in in burnt offerings and
[2:55:55] sacrifices I take no pleasure but Lo
[2:55:58] it's written of me in the volume of the
[2:56:00] book I have come to do thy will and so
[2:56:03] it's Consecration and its obedience and
[2:56:07] I believe that's the path forward to to
[2:56:10] receiving you know the the mantles The
[2:56:14] Authority The Inheritance that God has
[2:56:16] reserved for us and and we need it we
[2:56:20] you know we have to have a vision that
[2:56:22] we're setting ourselves towards because
[2:56:25] Proverbs without Vision the people
[2:56:29] perish but without Vision the people
[2:56:31] cast off restraint you know and so
[2:56:34] Vision it it aligns us Allah is the
[2:56:38] burnt offering and it means to ascend
[2:56:41] you know which you know it's a season of
[2:56:44] mountain climbing we're trying to ascend
[2:56:46] the mountain so I just have all of those
[2:56:48] those things kind of roaming around but
[2:56:50] the Crux of it for me is just
[2:56:52] Consecration and obedience Consecration
[2:56:56] and obedience Consecration and obedience
[2:56:59] and the same way that God was faithful
[2:57:01] to clothe his son and daughter Adam and
[2:57:03] Eve after the
[2:57:05] transgression and here's the last thing
[2:57:07] I'm going to say it was a department
[2:57:08] store it wasn't like uh uh a guarded
[2:57:12] room in a palace it was malls are
[2:57:16] publicly accessible and there so it's
[2:57:19] for everybody it's for Enoch and Sophia
[2:57:22] it's for it's for the the youngest and
[2:57:25] it's for the eldest and I believe that
[2:57:28] that Reservoir holds something for each
[2:57:32] of us that's worth contending for that
[2:57:35] that the enemy is obviously trying to
[2:57:38] keep us from obtaining and so we can't
[2:57:42] come into agreement with it we need to
[2:57:45] continue to press in you know Cor
[2:57:48] and then individually consecrate
[2:57:51] ourselves and walk in obedience powerful
[2:57:54] isn't that
[2:57:57] [Applause]
[2:58:06] powerful
[2:58:08] Hallelujah that's a
[2:58:15] gift it's worth it
[2:58:18] it's worth it to press in let's have the
[2:58:21] worship team come
[2:58:22] and let's make up our minds today that
[2:58:25] we're going to enter into a season
[2:58:28] of fresh
[2:58:32] consecration total
[2:58:37] sanctification and
[2:58:40] obedience we're being set
[2:58:43] apart not to sit down but we're being
[2:58:47] set set apart to move into
[2:58:51] action
[2:58:53] it's I I I I love the
[2:58:56] balance I love the representation of all
[2:58:59] the
[2:59:01] generations this generation can't do it
[2:59:06] without an older generation coming
[2:59:10] along cheering them on and praying them
[2:59:13] through and pushing them forward and the
[2:59:16] children depend the children are
[2:59:19] depending on us on the other two
[2:59:23] generations they're depending on
[2:59:25] us they've got to be prepared for
[2:59:28] whatever is to
[2:59:30] come it seems quite prophetic that this
[2:59:35] is the season that that we were brought
[2:59:38] to these
[2:59:40] circumstances
[2:59:43] Tabernacles the last feast
[2:59:48] the Feast of the open
[2:59:51] book our country is in an
[2:59:55] election there is a line being drawn in
[2:59:59] the sand for the future of our
[3:00:03] nation and the bride her time has
[3:00:08] come she is a
[3:00:10] multi-generational many membered
[3:00:14] bride worldwide bride she's got to make
[3:00:19] it you say well I can't get my eyes on
[3:00:21] the broader picture because I'm going
[3:00:23] through so much on a personal level but
[3:00:26] that's really
[3:00:27] contrary thinking because you've
[3:00:30] absolutely got to
[3:00:32] shift from your personal struggle to see
[3:00:36] the bigger picture to see that God has
[3:00:39] prepared everything you need to overcome
[3:00:43] it's hanging there for those who will
[3:00:45] pursue it those who will consecrate and
[3:00:49] dedicate uh I think we've I think we've
[3:00:52] received a gift from the Lord this
[3:00:53] morning through that dream through the
[3:00:56] through the Holy Ghost interpretation of
[3:00:58] the dream and the way that it stirs us
[3:01:02] and not just sorrow any any number of of
[3:01:08] enemies of
[3:01:10] emotions can stand as an enemy to try to
[3:01:14] prevent you from your inheritance for
[3:01:16] some it's just Envy
[3:01:18] and
[3:01:19] jealousies whatever it is sorrow seems
[3:01:22] to be the big one for this season but
[3:01:26] whatever your hindrance is know that
[3:01:30] when you desire to move in the opposite
[3:01:32] Spirit you're going to get hammers
[3:01:35] thrown at
[3:01:36] you when you rise up to overcome
[3:01:39] anything that's trying to overcome you
[3:01:42] you're going to disturb the atmosphere
[3:01:44] and you're going to become even a bigger
[3:01:46] Target for the enemy me in that moment
[3:01:50] you can't pull back in that moment
[3:01:52] you've got
[3:01:53] to you've got to press in you've got to
[3:01:57] strive even harder push a little harder
[3:02:00] contend a little harder so that that it
[3:02:02] will Retreat it has to retreat nothing
[3:02:05] can stand against the the the
[3:02:07] Spirit-filled Blood Bought bride Church
[3:02:09] of Jesus Christ but you've got to raise
[3:02:12] up and flex your muscles sometime you've
[3:02:14] got to show the enemy that you know what
[3:02:17] you're carrying
[3:02:18] it's by Grace it's certainly by Grace
[3:02:22] amen let's worship let's worship before
[3:02:24] we go uh we're going to pray some a
[3:02:28] couple have asked for prayer but but
[3:02:30] let's worship before we do that let's
[3:02:33] make this time a time of
[3:02:36] consecration let let's not consecrate
[3:02:39] and rededicate if we don't intend to
[3:02:42] obey let's go ahead and get it all
[3:02:45] settled and let's say Lord if you will
[3:02:48] clean me if you will help purify me and
[3:02:51] dress me I will step in I will obey I
[3:02:57] will pursue the anointings and the
[3:02:59] giftings and the mantel that are part of

[3:13:21] if you'll come I think maybe you were
[3:13:24] looking for a private uh uh audience of
[3:13:27] Prayer in my office but we're going to
[3:13:31] depend on the faith of all these people
[3:13:33] turn my mic up a little I don't have a
[3:13:35] lot of
[3:13:37] voice promised him a few weeks ago
[3:13:40] really a few months ago that if he got
[3:13:43] this far we would pray for him as he ENT
[3:13:47] into uh a
[3:13:50] chapter uh of of school and training to
[3:13:54] uh fulfill a dream that he has for a
[3:13:58] career it's a big
[3:14:00] deal and he has already overcome some
[3:14:05] obstacles and
[3:14:07] odds in the sense
[3:14:10] that school was not his favorite
[3:14:14] thing I happened to know where he in
[3:14:17] ited that
[3:14:25] from I lay down across the foot of your
[3:14:29] dad's bed when he was a young boy and I
[3:14:33] said you will get up and you will come
[3:14:36] to school now and you will
[3:14:42] finish and he
[3:14:44] did he uh has already broken through
[3:14:48] that plateau and has done quite well but
[3:14:52] tomorrow he starts the big deal
[3:14:55] school and God seems to me has worked
[3:14:59] out some things that will make it both
[3:15:02] convenient and pleasant and also extra
[3:15:06] hard so we want to pray that God will
[3:15:10] cover him and protect him and help him
[3:15:13] to retain all that he needs to retain
[3:15:17] and if this is God's perfect will for
[3:15:18] his life that he will open the door
[3:15:21] close all other doors that are not of
[3:15:23] him give him peace most of all we want
[3:15:27] this to be something that draws him
[3:15:29] closer to the Lord not not take him
[3:15:33] farther away so let's let's believe God
[3:15:36] let's anoint him and believe that God
[3:15:38] will use this for his purposes father in
[3:15:41] the name of
[3:15:43] Jesus it was his desire he ask for this
[3:15:48] moment of prayer we lay our hands on him
[3:15:51] now in the authority of Jesus Christ and
[3:15:56] we ask you Lord to cover him may he find
[3:16:02] Refuge underneath your wings may he be
[3:16:06] protected underneath your wings father
[3:16:11] stir
[3:16:13] him Jesus draw him
[3:16:17] to your side may he retain may he learn
[3:16:23] Lord may he
[3:16:25] consume what he needs to know in
[3:16:28] preparation for what you have for him we
[3:16:32] break off
[3:16:34] distraction in the name of Jesus and and
[3:16:38] we break off every side trail that the
[3:16:42] enemy might like to lead him on that
[3:16:46] wouldn't take closer to the goal we
[3:16:49] break that off in the name of the Lord
[3:16:52] Jesus and we ask for
[3:16:56] single-mindedness to be upon him a and
[3:16:59] may he be empowered and encouraged to
[3:17:02] know that he
[3:17:05] can because you said so we thank you
[3:17:09] Lord for what he has already
[3:17:11] accomplished with your help we celebrate
[3:17:15] what he has broken through
[3:17:17] to get to where he is today and we ask
[3:17:20] that you go with him may he also
[3:17:25] rededicate and
[3:17:27] reconsecrate his heart and Life to you
[3:17:30] today as you come alongside to help him
[3:17:34] Lord in every step of this training and
[3:17:37] school Endeavor Lord thank you thank you
[3:17:42] for reaching
[3:17:44] him for drawing him Lord may he be a
[3:17:50] light may he break the
[3:17:52] mold may he resist the need to fit in
[3:17:58] and may he have a
[3:18:00] backbone may may he be like a
[3:18:03] salmon in a in a in a ocean of
[3:18:07] jellyfish may he stand for what is right
[3:18:11] what is righteous what is
[3:18:14] Holy Father we ask
[3:18:17] that you get
[3:18:19] Glory you get
[3:18:21] Glory out of his life you called him
[3:18:24] from his mother's womb and now Lord we
[3:18:28] need you to wrap him up in your love and
[3:18:32] care in the name of
[3:18:35] Jesus in the name of Jesus we thank
[3:18:38] you thank you Lord
[3:18:42] hallelujah

[3:19:00] good you are good you are
[3:19:05] good
[3:19:07] oh you are good you are
[3:19:12] good oh
[3:19:17] excuse
[3:19:19] me I want us to pray for Megan now that
[3:19:25] God would just bless and strengthen her
[3:19:29] and help her in every way she has had a
[3:19:33] a hard time H God is a god of hard times
[3:19:37] he he knows he understands he sees but
[3:19:43] you know if we just took this dream yeah
[3:19:46] and just applied it to their loss also
[3:19:51] uh not in any way to minimalize it or or
[3:19:56] deit what am I looking for the word I'm
[3:19:58] looking for
[3:20:00] delegitimize their sorrow but but to say
[3:20:03] okay now if this emotion should raise up
[3:20:08] as an enemy to try to keep you then then
[3:20:10] it's got to be dealt with just like we
[3:20:12] would deal with any enemy so please know
[3:20:16] that
[3:20:18] it's all right to hurt and to be
[3:20:21] sad and we have no right to tell you how
[3:20:24] to get over it or what to get you know
[3:20:26] it's just not our place but if this
[3:20:30] thing seeks to settle and keep you from
[3:20:34] getting your clothes off the rack your
[3:20:37] inheritance then we have to deal with it
[3:20:39] as such and I think that's kind of the
[3:20:41] inspiration that I'm feeling so reach
[3:20:43] your hand toward her father in the name
[3:20:46] name of
[3:20:48] Jesus we we just
[3:20:52] honor we honor your will and your plan
[3:20:56] for their lives you have made precious
[3:21:00] promises over them both and we have seen
[3:21:04] them
[3:21:05] rise we've seen them
[3:21:07] grow we've seen them move closer to you
[3:21:12] and our hearts break for their loss
[3:21:17] but today we ask that you would break
[3:21:21] off yes any way that the enemy would try
[3:21:26] to attach himself to this
[3:21:30] situation in the name of
[3:21:35] Jesus
[3:21:40] Oh strengthen her in every
[3:21:45] way may she
[3:21:47] not be
[3:21:49] impeded or
[3:21:51] handicapped by this
[3:21:54] emotion but but may she be
[3:21:58] inspired really inspired to press
[3:22:03] past everything that would distract to
[3:22:07] take a hold of your precious promises
[3:22:12] for their lives as your servants
[3:22:17] now only you can heal a broken heart and
[3:22:20] only you can
[3:22:22] mend what has been lost but you can in
[3:22:29] such a way that you get glory for your
[3:22:33] name may may she just be
[3:22:37] empowered
[3:22:38] [Music]
[3:22:43] oh is
[3:22:54] to rise to the
[3:22:57] top
[3:23:01] Jesus you have an ordained
[3:23:05] way for this pain to become
[3:23:11] fuel to
[3:23:13] recharge to
[3:23:19] if that was not your plan you would have
[3:23:21] never allowed this to cross their path J
[3:23:26] so we ask you to
[3:23:28] redeem every
[3:23:30] portion of this
[3:23:32] emotion of this
[3:23:34] loss deep deep loss redeem It For Your
[3:23:40] Glory and and may she Girt up
[3:23:43] spiritually may she Girt up and and be
