[0:00] because you have become one with the
[0:04] testator
[0:12] he will be true to this Covenant that he
[0:15] made with us through the blood of the
[0:18] body of the Lord Jesus
[0:20] a covenant is a legal binding contract
[0:24] for either of the parties involved to
[0:28] fail to carry out their contracted
[0:30] details and requirements as outlined in
[0:33] the legal agreement it can render
[0:35] the remainder of the agreed terms both
[0:39] null and void
[0:42] I'll talk to you about that just a
[0:44] moment
[0:45] have you ever broke your Covenant with
[0:47] the Lord
[0:48] let me see you let me see you let me see
[0:51] you have you ever broke your Covenant
[0:53] with the Lord sure we have
[0:56] if you chose anything but his
[0:59] righteousness
[1:02] now doesn't it seem like them that the
[1:05] whole thing would be null and void
[1:07] legally it would be
[1:09] but God couldn't allow that to happen
[1:13] he wrote a fixed contract
[1:18] he rigged a contract
[1:21] he didn't write a contract that can be
[1:24] held to the standards of American law
[1:27] he wrote one bigger than that
[1:30] he said both he who sanctifies
[1:33] and he who is Sanctified is one
[1:36] and even your breaking your vow cannot
[1:41] know and void the contract because you
[1:46] have become one with the testator
[1:51] you have become one with him
[1:57] now if that makes you want to be
[1:58] spiritually lazy you're not hearing this
[2:00] with a revelation you're hearing it with
[2:02] a head knowledge when I hear this it
[2:05] doesn't make me want to see what I can
[2:06] do to be more like the world
[2:09] and make me want to pursue the things of
[2:11] life in the world anymore it makes me
[2:14] want to run to Jesus with everything
[2:15] I've got and say Lord oh papa
[2:20] look what you did you required so much
[2:26] of me and then you stepped out and
[2:29] became all that was required of me
[2:34] he who is joined in the Lord
[2:38] to the Lord is one spirit with him you
[2:42] ever read this Bible
[2:44] it's a book full of crack pots
[2:48] it's a book full of murderers
[2:51] adulterers all all believers
[2:55] cheaters gamblers
[2:59] usurpers
[3:00] and yet God used every one of them
[3:03] he had a plan
[3:05] he had a purpose he did not look for
[3:08] Perfect People
[3:10] he needed the people that were not
[3:12] perfect so that he could send the Holy
[3:15] Ghost into their lives and make them
[3:19] perfect
[3:21] I loved him enough to come from the
[3:24] balconies of heaven and walk among them
[3:26] and bleed
[3:27] and be tempted first and then bleed and
[3:29] die and resurrect on their behalf but
[3:31] I'll go one more than that because when
[3:33] I leave this world I know they're going
[3:36] to be tempted
[3:38] to trust me one minute and doubt me the
[3:40] next
[3:42] I know life is going to squeeze them
[3:44] here and shove them there and place them
[3:47] over Yonder so what I will do is I won't
[3:49] just be a God above them and I won't
[3:51] just be a god with them but I'll come
[3:54] right down and be a god living in them
