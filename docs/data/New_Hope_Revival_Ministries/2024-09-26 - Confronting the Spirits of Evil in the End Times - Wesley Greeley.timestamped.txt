[0:00] we have heard it said over and over and
[0:03] over again that in the last age that
[0:06] there would be a culmination of all of
[0:10] the spirits of evil that had been in all
[0:14] of the other Church ages there would be
[0:16] a culmination of the evil and that we as
[0:20] people in the end time we would have to
[0:22] face those things we know that the lid
[0:26] of hell has been ripped off and the
[0:28] spirits of dark Ness that have been down
[0:31] Through the Ages they're just looking
[0:33] for something or someone uh specifically
[0:37] they're looking for someone to inhabit
[0:40] the the the spirits do not like to be
[0:43] disembodied they are looking for a body
[0:46] to dwell in we can go to the scripture
[0:49] and see that when those Spirits were CA
[0:53] cast out of the demoniac uh who was in
[0:57] the graveyard they wanted somewhere to
[0:59] go and when Jesus cast them out they
[1:02] asked if they could go into the swine we
[1:05] know that they were granted permission
[1:08] and they went into the swine and
[1:09] immediately the swine jumped off the
[1:11] cliff and they all
[1:14] drowned so where did the spirits go
[1:16] after
[1:18] that they were still looking for a body
[1:21] to dwell in they were still looking for
[1:24] someone to inhabit they wanted somewhere
[1:27] to go we know that that with all of
[1:30] these Spirits floating around those
[1:33] things that we cannot see but yet they
[1:37] try to infiltrate our mind and and on a
[1:40] daily basis thoughts split across our
[1:43] mind they're not
[1:46] ours yet if we're in a vulnerable place
[1:51] we may entertain
[1:53] them we may momentarily give them a
[1:57] place to Lodge
[2:00] and and they talk to us for a little
[2:02] while and we talk back to them in some
[2:06] instances we find ourselves immediately
[2:09] saying that's not mine get out of here
[2:13] there are other times it may last for
[2:16] some minutes and there are other times
[2:18] where we entertain it for days weeks
[2:21] months and perhaps even years but a
[2:24] child of God has got to recognize that
[2:27] there are some things that fly through
[2:29] through our mind but they're not ours
[2:32] and we immediately need to take control
[2:35] of them and say not today sainton it's
[2:38] not mine I don't I'm not going to have
[2:41] this and we you know we could keep the
[2:43] victory a whole lot better if we learned
[2:45] to talk back to the
[2:47] devil we have been told in the scripture
[2:50] over and over and over again fear not
[2:54] but I think we're intimidated or afraid
[2:56] sometimes to talk back to the devil when
[2:58] he tries to to come with a thought or an
[3:01] idea or something of that dark world to
[3:04] put in our mind and cause us to
[3:07] entertain it and to live it out but
[3:09] that's not the call of a holy ghost
[3:12] child of God our call is to get rid of
[3:16] everything that is unlike Jesus Christ
[3:19] and we can't just say Lord take this out
[3:22] of me and remain as an empty
[3:25] vessel we must be filled and refilled
[3:29] and refilled with the holy ghost power
[3:33] over and over again because we don't
[3:36] want any voids in our life because the
[3:39] devil is as a roaring lion he is looking
[3:43] for someone to inhabit he's looking for
[3:46] someone to take control of and all he
[3:49] needs is one little door to get into and
[3:53] we need to close off all of those doors
[3:55] and continually as Believers saying Lord
[3:59] refill me refill me any place in me when
[4:03] when we repent and we ask the Lord to
[4:05] move something out of us we immediately
[4:08] want to ask the Lord Fill Me Lord with
[4:11] your holy spirit let your life come in
[4:14] and inhabit that spot in me because I
[4:17] don't want any place in there where the
[4:19] enemy can have free reign in my life
