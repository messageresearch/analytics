[37:12] and we want to remember every one of
[37:15] them the lord knows the need as we go to
[37:18] prayer
[37:19] i've been sent
[37:21] these requests for
[37:23] from sister sharon
[37:25] there's a lady named meredith that is
[37:27] asking that we would pray
[37:29] she's getting a pathology report
[37:31] tomorrow concerning a hysterectomy and
[37:33] she would appreciate if we pray
[37:35] concerning that report we ask the lord
[37:38] to touch this lady also for natasha at
[37:40] the loss of her father and daily focus
[37:42] on the loss of her husband let's ask the
[37:45] lord to give her grace as she deals with
[37:48] the grief the lord would minister to her
[37:51] and that she would give it to the lord
[37:53] she would know how to give it to the
[37:55] lord and then there are also several
[37:57] pastors
[37:58] seeking god for deeper truths and wisdom
[38:01] in this season the lord knows who they
[38:03] are and i know that the lord knows how
[38:06] to open up the eyes of the blind he
[38:08] knows how to reveal more truth to us
[38:11] do you have need by the lifting of the
[38:13] hand today all over this building those
[38:16] of you that are watching this service by
[38:18] the stream though we cannot see your
[38:19] hands we're remembering you to the lord
[38:22] today asking the lord to minister to
[38:24] your needs that you have
[38:27] we have several needs uh would you pray
[38:30] for brother steve curry he was in the
[38:33] hospital
[38:34] uh two nights ago
[38:37] and they gave him fluids
[38:39] and some iv
[38:42] i guess it was iv fluid and maybe some
[38:44] broad spectrum antibiotic
[38:46] and
[38:48] he was only there one night and because
[38:49] of the new protocol sister anita
[38:51] couldn't stay with him
[38:53] they came home yesterday about i think
[38:55] they got home about five o'clock
[38:57] and last night about 11 they got a phone
[39:00] call from the cancer
[39:02] treatment center telling them that there
[39:04] was bacteria in his blood and he needed
[39:06] to get to the emergency room as quickly
[39:09] as possible to get on an iv well that's
[39:12] a little bit hard to do but they got him
[39:14] to houston and they
[39:16] started him on a specific after the
[39:19] cultures came back a specific antibiotic
[39:23] and he has now been transported back to
[39:25] the cancer
[39:27] center and uh
[39:29] sister anita was going home to get a
[39:30] little rest because they will not let
[39:33] her stay with him right now but she can
[39:35] go up i think later today for a visit so
[39:37] we're praying against
[39:39] bacteria in his bloodstream that god
[39:42] will give him total deliverance over
[39:45] that and
[39:46] his ability to hold fluid to keep fluid
[39:49] he is losing fluid it is they're just
[39:52] having a hard time keeping him hydrated
[39:54] we want to believe that god but but they
[39:56] told me that the oncologist looked at
[39:59] him and said
[40:00] you you look unbelievable we can't
[40:02] hardly believe the change and he has
[40:05] some swelling but he has gained weight
[40:08] and that that was a big shock to them
[40:12] so we want to remember them to the lord
[40:14] in prayer solomon tested positive for
[40:16] kovid on the day that he left here
[40:19] and uh so there were a few people
[40:21] exposed and that's why they're not here
[40:23] today
[40:25] there is fever at rj's house and with
[40:29] that new little baby there we're praying
[40:31] hard for them that god will give them
[40:33] great protection and grace over this
[40:36] sister teresa has been having some cold
[40:38] symptoms and possible exposure brother
[40:42] robert possible exposure at work
[40:44] and so there are several who have opted
[40:47] not to be here today
[40:49] because of
[40:50] protecting us they wanted to protect
[40:52] those of us who would be gathered here
[40:55] we ask that everyone would just use
[40:57] wisdom if you know that you've been
[40:58] exposed then you should pray a little
[41:01] bit and consider how how you you know
[41:04] interact with other people i i feel a
[41:07] little bit bad because
[41:09] someone made a statement to me not a
[41:11] believer but someone made a statement to
[41:13] me said well if i tested positive i
[41:15] would just go to the store and do
[41:16] whatever i else i'd been doing and let
[41:18] let everybody suffer like i was
[41:20] suffering i would hope that god's people
[41:23] would be smarter and wiser and more
[41:25] loving than that so we've got to be
[41:28] watchful
[41:29] and so let's pray for all of these uh
[41:32] sister pam i mean she is my sister by
[41:34] faith pam tebow uh meeks haskovid and so
[41:39] we're praying for her and there was
[41:41] exposure and that's why uh that's why
[41:44] luke and megan are not here today is to
[41:47] protect us but let's ask the lord to
[41:50] move in all of this
[41:52] you know in my in my flesh i say here we
[41:55] go again
[41:56] but you know there's no reason to be
[41:59] alarmed or fearful we just say god watch
[42:01] over us all keep us safe
[42:04] uh let's just be mindful of the elderly
[42:06] that are here today if you're
[42:09] you know those that are a little bit
[42:10] older or have some other conditions
[42:12] let's just stay away from them as much
[42:14] as possible not be right up in their
[42:16] face
[42:17] this is a very contagious strain it's
[42:20] affecting people a lot less
[42:23] but there are some who are suffering
[42:25] greatly from it the hospitals are

[1:04:58] verse 10
[1:04:59] this is our lord
[1:05:01] teaching his disciples how to pray
[1:05:04] thy kingdom come
[1:05:07] thy will be done
[1:05:10] in earth
[1:05:11] as it is
[1:05:13] in heaven why don't we read it together
[1:05:15] one time even as a prayer thy kingdom

[1:05:20] will be done in earth as it is in heaven

[1:05:31] i'm going to read from verse 18 to verse
[1:05:35] 29
[1:05:37] i want to speak today on our unshakable
[1:05:40] unmovable
[1:05:42] kingdom
[1:05:44] our unshakable unmovable kingdom
[1:05:49] verse 18 for ye are not come
[1:05:52] unto the mount that might be touched and
[1:05:56] that burn with fire
[1:05:58] nor unto blackness and darkness and
[1:06:01] tempest
[1:06:02] and the sound of a trumpet
[1:06:05] and the voice of words which voice they
[1:06:09] that heard and treated that the word
[1:06:11] should not be spoken to them anymore
[1:06:15] for they could not endure that which was
[1:06:18] commanded and if so much as a beast
[1:06:21] touched the mountain it shall be stoned
[1:06:24] or thirst through with a thrust through
[1:06:28] with a dart
[1:06:30] and so terrible was the sight that moses
[1:06:33] said i exceedingly
[1:06:36] fear and quake
[1:06:39] but ye are come
[1:06:41] unto mount zion and unto the city
[1:06:45] of the living god
[1:06:47] the heavenly jerusalem
[1:06:49] and to an innumerable
[1:06:52] company of angels
[1:06:55] to the general assembly
[1:06:57] and church of the firstborn which are
[1:07:00] written in heaven and to god the judge
[1:07:03] of all and to the spirits of just men
[1:07:08] made perfect
[1:07:10] and to jesus
[1:07:12] the mediator of the new covenant
[1:07:15] and to the blood of sprinkling that
[1:07:18] speaketh better things than that of abel
[1:07:23] see that ye refuse not him that speaketh
[1:07:27] for if they escape not who refused him
[1:07:31] that spake on earth much more shall not
[1:07:34] we escape if we turn away from him
[1:07:38] that speaketh from heaven
[1:07:41] whose voice
[1:07:43] then shook the earth
[1:07:50] you all hear that
[1:07:55] something's going off up here it could
[1:07:56] be the are there headphones up here
[1:07:59] it could be in the headphone
[1:08:01] i'm not going to tell you what it
[1:08:02] sounded like
[1:08:04] it sounded like a rattle
[1:08:08] we may be put to the test
[1:08:13] and if we do i'm going to ask you where
[1:08:15] you want the back door
[1:08:18] i'm not sure i have the faith to take up
[1:08:20] the snake
[1:08:21] but i might
[1:08:23] i think it sounded to me like it was
[1:08:25] coming out of a of a headset it was uh
[1:08:28] sounded like a something coming out of
[1:08:30] that headset there
[1:08:33] forgive us
[1:08:35] whose voice
[1:08:36] then
[1:08:37] shook the earth
[1:08:39] but now he hath promised saying yet once
[1:08:43] more
[1:08:44] i shake not the earth only
[1:08:48] but also
[1:08:50] heaven
[1:08:51] and this word
[1:08:53] yet once more
[1:08:55] signifieth the removing of those things
[1:08:58] that are shaken as of things that are
[1:09:01] made that those things which cannot be
[1:09:06] shaken
[1:09:07] may
[1:09:08] remain
[1:09:10] wherefore this is where we are wherefore
[1:09:14] we
[1:09:15] receiving a kingdom
[1:09:17] which cannot be moved are you with me in
[1:09:21] the word
[1:09:22] wherefore we receiving a kingdom which
[1:09:25] cannot be moved
[1:09:28] let us have grace
[1:09:30] whereby
[1:09:32] we may serve god
[1:09:34] acceptably
[1:09:36] with reverence
[1:09:38] and godly fear
[1:09:41] for our
[1:09:43] god
[1:09:44] is
[1:09:45] a consuming
[1:09:47] fire
[1:09:48] read 28-29 with me again
[1:09:51] wherefore
[1:09:53] we receiving a kingdom which cannot be
[1:09:56] moved let us have grace whereby
[1:10:00] we may serve god acceptably with
[1:10:04] reverence and godly fear for our god is
[1:10:09] a consuming fire
[1:10:12] let's pray together lord jesus
[1:10:15] we come to you
[1:10:17] by the great grace and privilege that
[1:10:20] you have given us
[1:10:22] we are not coming as beggars
[1:10:25] we are coming as invited sons
[1:10:29] to lay our petition before you today
[1:10:32] and when we leave it on the altar we
[1:10:35] walk away with the assurance that you
[1:10:38] have taken our burden you are bearing
[1:10:41] our cares and you are helping us with
[1:10:45] everything that we have need of for we
[1:10:48] are a needy people today now lord we
[1:10:52] have fought this week
[1:10:54] all of the things that we fight as
[1:10:56] believers we have faced many situations
[1:11:01] since we gathered together on tuesday
[1:11:04] night but by grace we have made it
[1:11:07] through
[1:11:08] we are here today to receive something
[1:11:11] from your word that will strengthen us
[1:11:14] that will empower and equip us to face
[1:11:18] whatever it is that comes our way this
[1:11:22] coming week we need your word to sustain
[1:11:26] us
[1:11:27] we need your word to strengthen us so we
[1:11:31] approach you with a humble heart and yet
[1:11:34] boldly because of the invitation we ask
[1:11:37] that you would infuse us with your life
[1:11:40] today we pray for holy ghost protection
[1:11:44] over every person under the sound of my
[1:11:47] voice from the top of their head to the
[1:11:50] souls of their feet we pray lord that if
[1:11:53] they come in contact with that virus
[1:11:56] that the holy ghost in them and the
[1:11:58] healing virtue of the lord would just
[1:12:01] repel it and push it back in this hour
[1:12:04] we don't want anything to hinder our
[1:12:07] ability to gather in your name
[1:12:09] we need it lord i need it i need that
[1:12:14] corporate anointing that we experience
[1:12:17] this morning in worship and we ask lord
[1:12:21] that you would give us a grace to be
[1:12:23] able to continue in this way come now in
[1:12:27] the wonderful name of the lord jesus
[1:12:29] christ we pray and the saints said
[1:12:33] amen you may be seated
[1:12:38] hebrews is
[1:12:40] showing us
[1:12:41] in the writings of the apostle paul
[1:12:45] quite a contrast of mountains
[1:12:48] he said there was a time that we were
[1:12:50] called to mount sinai
[1:12:53] and that was a different kind of
[1:12:55] mountain than the one we're called to in
[1:12:56] this hour
[1:12:58] it was a mountain of lightnings and
[1:13:00] thunderings and voices
[1:13:02] mysterious shofar blasts
[1:13:05] shakings and rumblings and thick clouds
[1:13:09] and flashes of color and light
[1:13:12] it was such a display that even moses
[1:13:15] was struck by the awesomeness in fact
[1:13:18] the word that is used here by by the
[1:13:21] writer is terrible
[1:13:24] and we know that this is not terrible in
[1:13:26] the sense of awful but it is it is being
[1:13:29] awestruck it is
[1:13:32] absolutely standing almost speechless
[1:13:35] and motionless as you look at all the
[1:13:38] activity that's going on on the top of
[1:13:41] this mountain but paul said we are not
[1:13:44] called in this hour to approach god on
[1:13:47] mount sinai we have another invitation
[1:13:51] all together we have a mountain that's
[1:13:53] more welcoming
[1:13:56] than mount sinai
[1:13:57] now paul wants to bring a balance in the
[1:14:00] end of this reading and so he tells us
[1:14:02] that yes we must accept what god has
[1:14:06] done for us and we must serve god in an
[1:14:09] acceptable manner and we must approach
[1:14:12] him in reverence and godly fear so we're
[1:14:16] not just throwing ourselves
[1:14:19] haphazardly on mount zion there is a
[1:14:22] protocol
[1:14:23] anytime we approach the king do you
[1:14:26] understand that we want to come with a
[1:14:28] humble heart we want to come with clean
[1:14:31] hands but i want you to know the
[1:14:33] environment of sinai will stay back
[1:14:39] make sure you keep your distance
[1:14:43] because if you break through
[1:14:45] you may die
[1:14:48] if even an animal should get too close
[1:14:51] to the base of that mountain the animal
[1:14:54] was thrust through and he fell over dead
[1:14:58] so i'm telling you that's not really a
[1:15:00] welcoming environment it wasn't intended
[1:15:02] to be
[1:15:03] it was a place where god would meet his
[1:15:06] prophet and this prophet would come down
[1:15:08] out of that mountain and deliver the
[1:15:10] word of the lord to the people it wasn't
[1:15:13] an invitation to the congregation it was
[1:15:16] only to them that god would speak to lip
[1:15:19] to ear and moses would then come and he
[1:15:22] would declare the word of the lord
[1:15:24] the people didn't want moses you know
[1:15:26] they didn't want a prophet standing
[1:15:28] between them and god until they heard
[1:15:30] his voice on the top of mount sinai then
[1:15:33] they said hey could you come back and
[1:15:36] help us out we don't really want to hear
[1:15:38] his voice because what we've seen is so
[1:15:41] awesome and so terrible we don't want to
[1:15:44] be consumed by it we would much rather
[1:15:46] you stand between us and god and so this
[1:15:49] was god's way of bringing the people to
[1:15:52] accept a prophet for their day and we're
[1:15:54] thankful for how god used moses and
[1:15:58] joshua who followed him there's a
[1:16:00] different environment in the body of
[1:16:03] christ today
[1:16:04] this should not be an environment that
[1:16:07] that causes us to be lax
[1:16:09] or to be slack or to be lukewarm
[1:16:13] it's not an environment that should
[1:16:15] encourage us to let down our standard
[1:16:18] it should be an encouragement to keep
[1:16:21] the standard as high as it has ever been
[1:16:25] because the enemy would like to come in
[1:16:27] with compromise
[1:16:29] and he would like for some to lose out
[1:16:32] you and i may not be focusing on those
[1:16:35] things but i'm telling you they're weak
[1:16:37] people
[1:16:38] they're weaker christian than you that
[1:16:40] are focusing on these things
[1:16:43] and to those who focus on those things
[1:16:45] it becomes a stumbling block to them
[1:16:48] and the bible said be careful that you
[1:16:50] don't lay a stumbling block in your
[1:16:52] neighbor's path
[1:16:54] amen so don't get any shorter
[1:16:59] no no shorter you've gotten about the
[1:17:02] limit of how short you can go with your
[1:17:04] dresses so don't do that
[1:17:06] because this is an hour where people
[1:17:11] oh it gets quiet
[1:17:13] 25 years ago i used to say that and
[1:17:16] people say hey man brother come on
[1:17:18] preach it now
[1:17:20] that's because you weren't guilty
[1:17:23] and when people are not guilty
[1:17:26] well they can just say man loud and bold
[1:17:28] and fine and getting such a blessing out
[1:17:31] of it but if there's some that kind of
[1:17:32] fall under the influence i want you to
[1:17:35] know we are a part of an entirely
[1:17:38] different kingdom
[1:17:40] than the one we're living in it seems
[1:17:42] oh yes we're thankful i'm so thankful
[1:17:46] that we're not living on mount sinai i'm
[1:17:50] thankful that we're living on mount zion
[1:17:53] i'm thankful that there's a difference
[1:17:55] in the atmosphere but it doesn't mean
[1:17:58] that we can let down the bar
[1:18:00] it doesn't mean we can compromise the
[1:18:02] word it doesn't mean that we can look
[1:18:05] like the world
[1:18:07] it doesn't give us permission to show
[1:18:09] off uh those things that we have covered
[1:18:12] in modesty
[1:18:14] because we're in the end time it's a
[1:18:16] time to be more modest
[1:18:18] you say well who are you preaching to
[1:18:20] every person under the sound of my voice
[1:18:25] whoever has an ear
[1:18:27] to hear
[1:18:29] let them hear it's an hour to hold on
[1:18:34] with everything you've got don't remove
[1:18:37] the ancient landmarks but stand
[1:18:41] amen there are standards that are given
[1:18:43] to us in the scripture that are
[1:18:46] uncompromisable they can't be moved they
[1:18:48] can't be changed there are community
[1:18:51] standards that we might have as a part
[1:18:54] of who we are as a community of faith
[1:18:56] and we need to be very
[1:18:58] very careful with those
[1:19:01] because if you don't understand you can
[1:19:04] really get off the track
[1:19:06] and you can really confuse someone who
[1:19:09] is weak paul tells us it's the weaker
[1:19:12] ones among us who are watching the diet
[1:19:15] and who are watching every feast and
[1:19:17] watching all these things making sure
[1:19:20] that everybody no one's eating that
[1:19:22] that's been sacrificed to animals and so
[1:19:24] forth those people have uh value as well
[1:19:28] because i've once been a weak one have
[1:19:30] you ever been a weak one
[1:19:32] so when we get a little weaker we start
[1:19:35] examining each other
[1:19:37] and we don't want to do that because if
[1:19:39] you've got your eyes on people it means
[1:19:41] you're not looking at jesus
[1:19:43] i need a little help
[1:19:45] you want to put all of your focus on the
[1:19:48] lord jesus christ
[1:19:50] and watch him
[1:19:52] we're thankful for zion
[1:19:54] we're thankful that we are a part of a
[1:19:56] kingdom that cannot be shaken
[1:20:00] this world is shaking
[1:20:03] right
[1:20:04] everything we know
[1:20:06] is being shaken
[1:20:09] in this hour we've had two plus years of
[1:20:13] unusual shakings
[1:20:16] things that we have perhaps never dealt
[1:20:19] with before in in our lifetime
[1:20:26] we don't hardly know what to think about
[1:20:28] it
[1:20:29] i heard a report this week that said
[1:20:32] because of the virus
[1:20:34] the flu
[1:20:35] will never be the same
[1:20:38] and that it will be more deadly going
[1:20:40] forward than it has ever been before
[1:20:44] i don't have to tell you the dark
[1:20:47] bleak prophecy
[1:20:49] that our president has made again this
[1:20:52] year
[1:20:53] dark winter of death
[1:20:56] i tell you if that was the only hope i
[1:20:58] had
[1:21:01] you talk about people getting depressed
[1:21:03] in the winter what if you've got a
[1:21:05] national leader telling you oh
[1:21:08] you're going to lose
[1:21:10] i heard this statement made families
[1:21:13] that are grieving will grieve more
[1:21:16] as we go through
[1:21:18] this long dark winter well i want you to
[1:21:21] know they're just reporting what they
[1:21:24] know
[1:21:25] they're just reporting what they
[1:21:27] understand
[1:21:28] they're speaking of their own kingdom
[1:21:30] the kingdom that they're in fellowship
[1:21:32] with but i want you to understand we're
[1:21:35] living in another kingdom we're
[1:21:38] simultaneously on planet earth yes but
[1:21:41] we're living in another kingdom
[1:21:44] i remember an old song the hoppers used
[1:21:46] to sing said i'm a citizen of two worlds
[1:21:50] and it's hard to choose between them
[1:21:57] back then i thought that was a great
[1:21:59] song
[1:22:01] because you'd like to be with the lord
[1:22:03] but you'd like to be with your loved
[1:22:05] ones
[1:22:06] i understood what they meant but i want
[1:22:09] you to know i'm not singing that in
[1:22:10] 2022.
[1:22:13] it's hard to choose between them there's
[1:22:15] no choice
[1:22:17] there's no choice to be made we have
[1:22:19] already been born into an alternative
[1:22:22] kingdom
[1:22:23] in fact it's the original kingdom it's
[1:22:26] not the perverted one that we call
[1:22:28] planet earth the environment and society
[1:22:31] around us is a perverted society and a
[1:22:34] perverted atmosphere from the original
[1:22:37] that god created in eden
[1:22:39] we're not just going back to pentecost
[1:22:42] but the word has restored us all the way
[1:22:44] back to eden
[1:22:46] and i heard brother branham say this
[1:22:48] week do you know what that means he said
[1:22:50] it means dominion
[1:22:53] it means authority
[1:22:56] it means a people who are so much in
[1:22:59] tune with the kingdom of god that they
[1:23:02] are not movable they are not shakeable
[1:23:06] but they are standing firm like in a way
[1:23:09] really stronger than they have ever
[1:23:11] stood before because the winds that we
[1:23:14] have known in these past two years have
[1:23:17] caused our roots i hope and pray to go
[1:23:20] deeper into god's word so that nothing
[1:23:24] will move us off the truth we're going
[1:23:26] to stay with that truth no matter what
[1:23:29] people around us do we're going to stay
[1:23:32] with that word if you have that as your
[1:23:35] intention let me hear you say amen
[1:23:38] now we're moving on
[1:23:40] colossians chapter 1
[1:23:43] and verse 12 and 13.
[1:23:46] i want to read those verses of scripture
[1:23:49] before we break the message
[1:23:51] what god is giving us for today
[1:23:57] colossians 1 12 and 13
[1:23:59] giving thanks
[1:24:02] unto the father
[1:24:04] which hath made us meet
[1:24:06] to be partakers
[1:24:09] of the inheritance
[1:24:12] of the saints
[1:24:14] in
[1:24:14] light now the next verse
[1:24:18] who hath delivered us
[1:24:21] from the power
[1:24:23] of darkness
[1:24:24] how many of you are delivered from the
[1:24:26] power of darkness
[1:24:28] i want to testify of god's great grace
[1:24:31] who has delivered us
[1:24:33] from the power of darkness and then what
[1:24:35] has he done he has what
[1:24:38] translated
[1:24:40] us
[1:24:42] not he will
[1:24:44] not one glorious day
[1:24:47] but he
[1:24:48] hath translated
[1:24:50] us into what
[1:24:53] the kingdom of his dear son
[1:24:57] you my brother sister have been born
[1:25:01] by the transforming and translating
[1:25:04] power of the holy spirit out of the
[1:25:07] darkness of this world out of the
[1:25:10] kingdom of men out of the kingdom of
[1:25:13] darkness out of the kingdom of this
[1:25:15] world and into the kingdom of god
[1:25:19] we look for the kingdom of heaven but we
[1:25:22] have already been translated into the
[1:25:26] kingdom of his dear son and that kingdom
[1:25:31] is an unshakable kingdom it is an
[1:25:34] unmovable kingdom no matter what the
[1:25:37] devil pulls out of his bag of tricks
[1:25:40] in the message christ
[1:25:42] is the mystery of god revealed beginning
[1:25:46] in paragraph 154
[1:25:48] brother branham is preaching to us
[1:25:51] in that sermon on on the
[1:25:54] threefold purpose
[1:25:56] of his coming
[1:25:58] he said the coming of jesus to the earth
[1:26:01] can be summed up into three different
[1:26:06] purposes or expressions
[1:26:09] the threefold
[1:26:11] purpose of his coming and i love the way
[1:26:13] it's brought out here it's very
[1:26:15] condensed he preaches a whole sermon on
[1:26:18] it
[1:26:18] but here it's condensed
[1:26:20] first to express his self completely
[1:26:26] god
[1:26:27] in
[1:26:28] christ
[1:26:30] the most important mystery for you and i
[1:26:33] to get a hold of if we haven't already
[1:26:36] is that jehovah of the old testament is
[1:26:40] jesus of the new
[1:26:43] there is no higher revelation than that
[1:26:46] there's other revelation that builds in
[1:26:48] that but that is perhaps the highest of
[1:26:52] all revelation and you say doesn't
[1:26:54] everybody believe that what is the
[1:26:56] answer
[1:26:57] no
[1:26:58] no they don't they don't believe that
[1:27:01] jehovah of the old testament is jesus of
[1:27:04] the new this was the the first goal or
[1:27:08] purpose of jesus christ coming as the
[1:27:12] word made flesh to planet earth so that
[1:27:16] god in christ so that god could be fully
[1:27:21] completely
[1:27:22] expressed in the earth in the body of
[1:27:25] the anointed one
[1:27:27] god in a man
[1:27:30] oh this is so glorious and so wonderful
[1:27:34] to understand this great love story he
[1:27:38] loved us so much that he wanted to
[1:27:40] become even as we are so that he might
[1:27:43] make a way for you and i to become what
[1:27:45] he is
[1:27:46] what a glorious revelation
[1:27:49] second
[1:27:50] to have the preeminences
[1:27:53] by this
[1:27:54] in his church
[1:27:56] which is his body the bride till he
[1:28:00] could have the preeminence to express
[1:28:04] himself
[1:28:07] through them
[1:28:09] god
[1:28:10] sent christ
[1:28:12] to express himself
[1:28:15] completely
[1:28:17] in the earth
[1:28:19] number one
[1:28:20] number two god
[1:28:22] sent christ
[1:28:24] so that you and i
[1:28:26] might come to a place
[1:28:28] of allowing christ
[1:28:31] to have preeminence
[1:28:33] in our life
[1:28:35] that he might become the most important
[1:28:38] thing
[1:28:39] the most important one
[1:28:41] the brother sister you don't have a more
[1:28:44] important relationship
[1:28:49] there is no
[1:28:50] more important relate not not boss
[1:28:53] employee
[1:28:54] husband wife
[1:28:56] mother daughter
[1:28:58] father son
[1:28:59] brother in christ sister in christ
[1:29:02] there is no greater
[1:29:05] relationship in life
[1:29:07] than the one that you have been invited
[1:29:10] to have
[1:29:11] with god through jesus christ
[1:29:14] it should be the most important thing
[1:29:18] in all of our lives
[1:29:20] building that relationship feeding that
[1:29:23] relationship focusing on that
[1:29:25] relationship by chewing his word and
[1:29:28] allowing it to be digested in the spirit
[1:29:30] man so that we might then begin to
[1:29:33] reflect that so number one god's purpose
[1:29:36] in the earth by sending christ was that
[1:29:38] he might be completely represented in
[1:29:40] the earth in the body of our lord number
[1:29:43] two that he might be completely
[1:29:46] represented in the earth by the body of
[1:29:48] christ by the bride by the sons of god
[1:29:52] by those who were elected to come and
[1:29:56] demonstrate and express who jesus is to
[1:30:00] the whole world around us jesus is alive
[1:30:04] and well i want to tell you today
[1:30:06] jesus is alive and well i want to say to
[1:30:09] you streamers jesus is alive and well
[1:30:12] and he's living in his bride
[1:30:14] we're no longer in the in the in this in
[1:30:17] the same hour the the first hour the
[1:30:19] first
[1:30:20] dispensation the first revelation and
[1:30:23] understanding of this was that christ is
[1:30:27] the mystery of god
[1:30:29] revealed
[1:30:31] then we come to a revelation that the
[1:30:33] bride
[1:30:36] is the mystery
[1:30:38] of christ
[1:30:40] revealed
[1:30:41] now i know you've heard that before but
[1:30:43] i want to say it slow enough for you to
[1:30:45] make sure you're getting what we're
[1:30:47] saying
[1:30:48] if christ
[1:30:50] is the mystery of god revealed and we
[1:30:52] know that he is
[1:30:53] then the bride
[1:30:55] must be now
[1:30:57] the mystery of christ revealed in the
[1:31:00] earth
[1:31:01] meaning that god is now revealed through
[1:31:05] the bride
[1:31:06] are you with me
[1:31:07] now paragraph 156
[1:31:10] he says he gives us the next and
[1:31:14] thirdly to restore
[1:31:17] the kingdom
[1:31:19] to its
[1:31:20] rightly
[1:31:22] position
[1:31:25] the very purpose
[1:31:27] of the coming of christ to the earth was
[1:31:31] to restore
[1:31:32] god's kingdom to its rightly position
[1:31:37] now that means that there were those who
[1:31:40] were translated to the kingdom of god
[1:31:44] in the day and in the ministry of our
[1:31:47] lord jesus christ
[1:31:49] so for 2 000 years men and women have
[1:31:53] been translated by the new birth by the
[1:31:56] baptism of the holy ghost they have been
[1:31:59] translated from the kingdom of darkness
[1:32:02] to the kingdom of god this is not a
[1:32:04] future translation we're looking for a
[1:32:06] body change we're looking for a future
[1:32:09] translation for our body but now we're
[1:32:12] talking about what he has done for us
[1:32:14] spiritually
[1:32:15] he has already translated us from the
[1:32:19] kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of
[1:32:22] god so that the kingdom of god might be
[1:32:25] put back right into its rightful
[1:32:28] position in the earth how did the
[1:32:30] kingdom of god fall it fell by sin by
[1:32:34] the first adam back to where he walked
[1:32:37] in the cool of the evening with his
[1:32:39] people talked with them
[1:32:42] fellowshipped with them
[1:32:44] that is the kingdom
[1:32:47] that is the kingdom
[1:32:49] that christ came thirdly
[1:32:52] to restore in the earth
[1:32:54] a kingdom of fellowship with god
[1:32:57] now i know we make this statement you
[1:32:59] know he's just about too spiritually
[1:33:01] minded to be any earthly good
[1:33:04] well some people become fanatics
[1:33:06] but not because they've been working on
[1:33:08] their relationship with jesus christ
[1:33:10] anybody awake
[1:33:12] not because they've been working on
[1:33:14] their relationship with jesus christ
[1:33:16] that doesn't make you a fanatic
[1:33:18] come on now when you try to do it by
[1:33:20] your own effort
[1:33:22] by your own strife by your own sweat by
[1:33:25] your own labor that might make you a
[1:33:27] fanatic
[1:33:28] but when you come to him humbly
[1:33:31] and sincerely and you say lord i want to
[1:33:34] empty everything that i am i want to get
[1:33:37] it all laid out on the table so you can
[1:33:39] put me back together like you created me
[1:33:42] to be in the beginning i want to be
[1:33:44] restored to your first thoughts about me
[1:33:46] i want you to know folk i don't know if
[1:33:48] you can follow this today or not i'm not
[1:33:50] sure where you are physically or how
[1:33:52] you're feeling or whatever but i want
[1:33:54] you to understand that i believe with
[1:33:56] everything that i am that god is
[1:33:58] building a people in the last days who
[1:34:01] will be a part of a great quick last day
[1:34:05] expression of god's power in the earth i
[1:34:08] do not believe the bride's revival is
[1:34:10] finished i do not believe that god has
[1:34:13] done the last of what he's going to do i
[1:34:15] don't believe it's all over i don't
[1:34:17] believe we understand the fullness of
[1:34:19] the thunders as it is being preached all
[1:34:21] across the country i don't believe the
[1:34:23] fullness of that understanding has come
[1:34:25] to us yet
[1:34:27] it's there
[1:34:29] it's there i don't believe we understand
[1:34:31] the fullness of the seventh seal it's
[1:34:33] there
[1:34:34] i'm not saying it's something new
[1:34:37] i'm saying what he said
[1:34:40] he said i couldn't get it
[1:34:42] it went by me in an unknown tongue
[1:34:45] you heard him say
[1:34:46] you heard him say it was sealed up it
[1:34:49] won't we won't have the understanding of
[1:34:51] it until god chooses to let it sound
[1:34:54] again
[1:34:57] and when it does the bride will catch
[1:34:59] that it won't be something brand new
[1:35:01] like something she's never ever heard
[1:35:03] before it'll be some truth brother adam
[1:35:05] said laying in this word
[1:35:09] it'll be quickened to you
[1:35:12] let me ask you a question how many of
[1:35:14] you know some things but you know
[1:35:15] they've not yet been made alive
[1:35:18] you know it's right you know there are
[1:35:20] things you know there's things you
[1:35:21] understand because you've been a student
[1:35:24] of the word in the message but you're
[1:35:26] not walking in it you know i can't say
[1:35:28] i'm always sick feel i don't always feel
[1:35:31] like i'm seated in heavenly places with
[1:35:34] christ
[1:35:35] but i am
[1:35:37] i am there's never a time that i'm not
[1:35:39] because i've been pulled up into that
[1:35:41] place i just don't always take full
[1:35:43] advantage of where i've been called to
[1:35:45] and you don't either but there are
[1:35:47] things that will be quickened in us and
[1:35:49] made alive in us as we understand some
[1:35:53] simple things there are many simple
[1:35:54] truths that we have to let become a part
[1:35:57] of who we are so that we can start
[1:36:00] positioning ourselves to receive the
[1:36:02] understanding of those things that we do
[1:36:04] not yet have
[1:36:05] and nobody likes the simple i'll just be
[1:36:08] honest with you not not seemingly around
[1:36:09] this message anyway we try to over
[1:36:12] complicate things
[1:36:14] come on it gives us a sense of elitism
[1:36:17] when we complicate things that nobody
[1:36:19] else can understand but you know that's
[1:36:21] not the way it was intended to be god
[1:36:24] didn't want it to be that way he wanted
[1:36:26] to break it down and make it simple god
[1:36:28] wanted to express himself fully in the
[1:36:31] body on the earth so he did it he came
[1:36:33] in christ he wanted to have a people
[1:36:35] that will fully express christ to the
[1:36:37] earth around them so he did it he called
[1:36:39] out an elected bride and number three he
[1:36:42] wanted to restore the kingdom
[1:36:45] to its rightful position
[1:36:47] and in order for that to happen you've
[1:36:49] got to understand that you've got a king
[1:36:51] and you're living in a kingdom and it's
[1:36:53] not the united states of america and
[1:36:56] it's not planet earth it's the kingdom
[1:36:58] of god
[1:37:00] and the kingdom of god has its own way
[1:37:02] of doing things
[1:37:05] earth does it one way the world does it
[1:37:07] one way secular society does it one way
[1:37:10] but god's kingdom has an entirely
[1:37:13] different way to operate
[1:37:15] it has its own economics
[1:37:20] the economics of the kingdom of god are
[1:37:22] not like the economics of this world
[1:37:25] just a simple example
[1:37:27] if you want to have something you got to
[1:37:29] hold on to what you got
[1:37:31] you got to put it this is how the world
[1:37:33] teaches
[1:37:34] you've got to put it in a safe place
[1:37:37] not too risky
[1:37:40] and then watch that thing grow
[1:37:43] don't ever touch it
[1:37:45] watch it grow
[1:37:47] i don't want to go into anything that
[1:37:49] might persuade you one way or the other
[1:37:51] but
[1:37:52] you know stocks aren't enough
[1:37:54] so now it's cryptocurrency
[1:37:57] it'll be this or that or the other it's
[1:37:59] just going to continue to evolve and
[1:38:02] people are going to ride this trend or
[1:38:04] that trend or the other trend
[1:38:06] and that's how the economics of this
[1:38:08] world operate but the economics of the
[1:38:11] kingdom of god operate entirely
[1:38:13] differently
[1:38:14] that kingdom doesn't tell you to hold on
[1:38:15] to what you got
[1:38:17] that kingdom tells you to sow a seed
[1:38:21] you don't hide it in a hole to save it
[1:38:24] you actually turn loose of it to save it
[1:38:26] the only way you're promised to return
[1:38:29] from that is not by hiding it in a hole
[1:38:31] but by investing it into the kingdom of
[1:38:33] god i'm not going to preach on giving
[1:38:35] but i just want you to understand that
[1:38:37] the economics of the kingdom of god are
[1:38:39] not like the economics of the united
[1:38:41] states
[1:38:45] even even uh
[1:38:47] what's the guy that folk trust so much
[1:38:50] dave ramsey who who you know he gives
[1:38:53] amazing advice about two-thirds of it
[1:38:58] he's being called into question across
[1:39:00] the board now because of some of the
[1:39:02] advice that he gives there are other
[1:39:04] christian economists who are coming
[1:39:06] along and saying this is really
[1:39:08] dangerous advice and so they're kind of
[1:39:11] fighting it out and has to do with term
[1:39:13] life insurance and whole life and all
[1:39:15] the different things and so forth and
[1:39:17] etc and some when it did different than
[1:39:20] he did and they made a whole lot more
[1:39:22] than those who did what he said and so
[1:39:24] forth oh
[1:39:25] i can't keep up with that
[1:39:28] i don't mean we shouldn't be wise we
[1:39:31] should be wise but our main focus should
[1:39:34] be understanding that we are living in
[1:39:37] another kingdom altogether
[1:39:39] and the more like this world you become
[1:39:41] the more caught up you're going to be in
[1:39:44] in its kingdom dynamic how many of you
[1:39:46] want to operate in the dynamics of the
[1:39:48] kingdom of god i want to be a part of
[1:39:51] those economics i want that government
[1:39:53] to be a part of who i am i want the
[1:39:55] protocol of the kingdom of god to be the
[1:39:58] way i live my life i don't want to let
[1:40:00] the world be my example i want god's
[1:40:02] word to be my example
[1:40:05] are you with me
[1:40:06] i don't want everybody's doing it to be
[1:40:08] the way i choose what i'm going to do
[1:40:12] i want to hear another drumbeat
[1:40:14] i want to hear another heartbeat
[1:40:17] i want to march to the heartbeat of the
[1:40:19] king of kings and the lord of lords
[1:40:22] are you with me
[1:40:24] in the message five definite
[1:40:26] identifications of the true church of
[1:40:29] the living god if you haven't heard that
[1:40:31] it'd be a great opportunity now in the
[1:40:34] near future for you to go back and catch
[1:40:36] a little bit of that five definite
[1:40:38] identifications of the true church of
[1:40:41] the living god that's quite a title
[1:40:42] isn't it paragraph 180.
[1:40:45] he said what is
[1:40:47] the identification of the church
[1:40:50] what is she to be
[1:40:52] what was she
[1:40:53] what is it
[1:40:55] the called out group
[1:40:57] who set it up
[1:40:59] jesus christ not a bishop
[1:41:02] not the catholic church
[1:41:04] not methodist not luther not wesley no
[1:41:08] sir who set it up jesus christ what's
[1:41:13] what is
[1:41:14] its message
[1:41:17] repentance
[1:41:19] water baptism
[1:41:21] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:41:23] divine healing
[1:41:25] salvation
[1:41:27] how do we become a member of it
[1:41:30] by being born into it do you believe
[1:41:33] that can we get to heaven without it no
[1:41:36] sir
[1:41:37] for those that are dead in christ will
[1:41:40] god bring with him and not anyone else
[1:41:44] but those who are dead in christ he goes
[1:41:48] on
[1:41:49] jesus
[1:41:52] is coming for those that are dead in
[1:41:55] christ ephesians 4 chapter said no
[1:41:59] galatians
[1:42:00] i believe it is the fourth chapter said
[1:42:02] that those that are dead in christ will
[1:42:05] god bring with him those that are dead
[1:42:08] in christ will god bring with him now
[1:42:12] let's look at the next paragraph are we
[1:42:14] there yet yes now therefore
[1:42:18] she is a what
[1:42:20] called out group
[1:42:22] called out
[1:42:24] she heard a cry
[1:42:25] she heard a call
[1:42:27] she answered the call
[1:42:29] she moved away from her group
[1:42:31] and she found another group
[1:42:34] one that she'd been called to brother
[1:42:36] branham said a mystical
[1:42:39] body
[1:42:40] there's mystery
[1:42:42] in this body
[1:42:44] it's not like other bodies
[1:42:46] it's not like being a member of the odd
[1:42:48] fellas
[1:42:50] it's not like joining the masons or the
[1:42:52] shriners
[1:42:53] it's not a sorority
[1:42:55] it's not a club
[1:42:57] it's a mystical body
[1:43:00] a body is something made up of members
[1:43:03] all connected to one another functioning
[1:43:06] together for a greater purpose he said
[1:43:09] it's a mystical body who said it in
[1:43:12] order not peter not the pope
[1:43:15] christ
[1:43:16] set it in order before he died he spoke
[1:43:20] of it coming he said i will come and be
[1:43:23] king over this domain a little while and
[1:43:27] the world won't see me no more yet you
[1:43:30] shall see me you won't have nothing to
[1:43:33] do with the kingdom of the world you
[1:43:36] won't have nothing to do with the
[1:43:39] kingdom of the world you won't have
[1:43:42] nothing to do with the kingdom of the
[1:43:44] world if you're a part of the kingdom of
[1:43:46] god you won't have nothing to do with
[1:43:49] the kingdom of the world now you may not
[1:43:52] know this but this is so opposite of
[1:43:54] what the church is teaching today
[1:43:56] because they've got the seven mountain
[1:43:58] mandates you know where they believe
[1:44:00] that the church is going to take over
[1:44:02] these seven mountains of influence one
[1:44:04] of them being government one of them
[1:44:05] being hollywood
[1:44:08] and it goes on there's seven different
[1:44:10] ones i don't say that i could name them
[1:44:12] all now and it becomes quite a focus and
[1:44:16] multiple books are written about it in
[1:44:18] seminars and conferences and people are
[1:44:20] rushing there and they want to see how
[1:44:22] they might get involved in politics and
[1:44:24] how they might get involved in hollywood
[1:44:27] how they might get involved in the
[1:44:28] different aspects economics and whatever
[1:44:31] all these different mountains of
[1:44:33] influence but here a prophet a
[1:44:35] vindicated servant of the lord is
[1:44:37] telling us that once you understand who
[1:44:40] you are in the kingdom of god you won't
[1:44:42] have nothing to do with the kingdom of
[1:44:44] the world
[1:44:47] you see holy ghost-filled people are not
[1:44:49] being called into government office
[1:44:52] not in this hour
[1:44:54] it's far too late for that somebody said
[1:44:56] i don't understand how that could be
[1:44:57] possible and then you tell us to pray
[1:45:00] that the right one well we pray till we
[1:45:02] turn blue in the face
[1:45:04] but we understand
[1:45:06] that god is sovereign
[1:45:08] and we understand it's god who raises up
[1:45:11] kings and pulls them down
[1:45:13] come on but we still go and vote
[1:45:15] according to our conscience and
[1:45:17] according to how we feel led and what we
[1:45:19] expect and would like to see but we know
[1:45:22] that in the end of that god gets the
[1:45:24] last word
[1:45:28] a lot of disappointed people i still
[1:45:30] hear from them almost daily at least
[1:45:32] every other day
[1:45:34] i still get articles sent to me
[1:45:36] of how
[1:45:37] just any day now just any day now just
[1:45:40] any day now just any day now just any
[1:45:43] day now
[1:45:44] this whole thing's going to be turned
[1:45:46] over
[1:45:47] and the election in georgia's already
[1:45:49] someone told me it's about 14 days and
[1:45:52] the election in georgia is going to be
[1:45:53] overturned and that's going to throw the
[1:45:55] tide and and we're gonna celebrate the
[1:45:58] last three years of this with our
[1:46:00] president trump back in office and
[1:46:02] people are focusing on this and focusing
[1:46:04] on that even some of you get caught up
[1:46:06] in that from time to time but let me
[1:46:09] just say it's all right to have your
[1:46:11] thoughts and your feelings but once you
[1:46:13] become a part of the kingdom of god you
[1:46:15] won't have nothing to do with the
[1:46:17] kingdom of the world
[1:46:19] you will understand there's a different
[1:46:21] way of operation there's a different way
[1:46:24] of of of putting our focus and our
[1:46:27] attention and our heart into something
[1:46:29] if you want to prosper you put your
[1:46:31] heart into the kingdom of god
[1:46:33] you give god everything that he's asking
[1:46:36] of you you become a reflection of who he
[1:46:39] is in the earth and you're then a part a
[1:46:41] citizen of a kingdom that cannot be
[1:46:43] shaken
[1:46:45] and it can't be moved
[1:46:47] no matter who the president is
[1:46:50] is anybody with me
[1:46:51] she's a called out group a mystical body
[1:46:54] christ set it in order before he died he
[1:46:56] spoke of it coming i will come and be
[1:46:58] king over this domain a little while the
[1:46:59] world won't see me no more yet you'll
[1:47:01] see me you won't have nothing to do with
[1:47:04] the kingdom of the world
[1:47:07] look at john 3 with me just a moment
[1:47:12] i'm uh i wish i could thrill you
[1:47:15] but since i can't i'll just do my best
[1:47:17] to preach anyway
[1:47:20] john 3 3 jesus answered and said unto
[1:47:24] him verily verily
[1:47:26] i say unto thee
[1:47:27] except a man be
[1:47:30] born again
[1:47:31] he cannot see the kingdom of god
[1:47:35] we know that
[1:47:38] we know that
[1:47:40] you've got to know you've been born
[1:47:41] again
[1:47:43] with that very word translated the
[1:47:46] phrase translated means born from a
[1:47:48] higher place
[1:47:49] have you been born from above
[1:47:51] you were born from beneath when you were
[1:47:53] born here on the earth you were born of
[1:47:55] this kingdom
[1:47:56] you came here by a sex act you came here
[1:47:59] by
[1:48:00] natural birth process
[1:48:02] that's your first birth
[1:48:04] but the most important birth course you
[1:48:06] couldn't have the second without the
[1:48:07] first but the most important is your
[1:48:09] second birth your new birth because now
[1:48:12] in that moment you were born from above
[1:48:15] and the spirit of god then you're
[1:48:17] translated
[1:48:18] into a kingdom that cannot be shaken
[1:48:21] that cannot be moved and you now are
[1:48:23] filled with the very life of god the
[1:48:25] very life that was in the lord jesus
[1:48:27] christ verse 4 said nicodemus saith unto
[1:48:30] him how can a man be born when he's old
[1:48:33] can he enter the second time into his
[1:48:34] mother's womb and be born jesus answered
[1:48:37] and said verily verily i say unto thee
[1:48:40] except a man be born of water and of the
[1:48:42] spirit
[1:48:44] he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
[1:48:46] he goes on
[1:48:48] that which is born of the flesh
[1:48:52] is flesh and that which is born of the
[1:48:54] spirit
[1:48:56] is spirit you had to have a flesh birth
[1:48:59] you had to be born into the flesh you
[1:49:01] had to be expressed in the earth there's
[1:49:03] no doubt about it but that which is born
[1:49:05] of the spirit is spirit and that's the
[1:49:07] greatest birth marvel not that i've said
[1:49:09] unto thee you must be born again the
[1:49:11] wind bloweth where it listeth and now
[1:49:13] here is the sound thereof but can't not
[1:49:15] tell whence it cometh and whether it
[1:49:17] goeth so is everyone that is born of the
[1:49:22] spirit
[1:49:24] you don't understand them
[1:49:28] sometimes they don't understand
[1:49:30] themselves
[1:49:33] but they're doing what they can
[1:49:35] to be led by the spirit of god
[1:49:38] and i want you to know that's a that's a
[1:49:40] hard life sometimes because you have to
[1:49:43] stop and people don't like to stop
[1:49:45] you have to stop and contemplate you
[1:49:47] have to stop and pray you have to stop
[1:49:49] and miss a meal
[1:49:51] you have to stop and pull yourself aside
[1:49:53] sometime and make sure that you're still
[1:49:55] moving in synchronization with the heart
[1:49:58] of the father because there's a world
[1:50:00] around you that's trying to pull you
[1:50:01] into another kingdom
[1:50:03] anybody with me
[1:50:05] i'm gonna pull you into another kingdom
[1:50:07] i love this this place read read with me
[1:50:09] in bomb of gilead
[1:50:11] paragraph 20
[1:50:13] the prophet of god said our spirits
[1:50:16] has been born from above
[1:50:19] and in that land where we come from
[1:50:22] the nature and the habits of that land
[1:50:27] is holiness
[1:50:29] cleanliness
[1:50:31] godliness
[1:50:33] and if the spirit of that land moves
[1:50:35] into us
[1:50:37] then this land
[1:50:39] becomes strange to us
[1:50:42] because we're carrying the
[1:50:43] characteristics
[1:50:45] of another land
[1:50:47] of another homeland of another kingdom
[1:50:50] holiness cleanliness
[1:50:52] godliness and if the spirit of that land
[1:50:55] moves into us then this land is a
[1:50:58] strange to us
[1:51:01] and it goes on
[1:51:03] because your soul
[1:51:04] and your spirit
[1:51:06] motivates you
[1:51:08] it
[1:51:09] makes you what you are
[1:51:12] powerful
[1:51:14] it's not your body that makes you who
[1:51:16] you are
[1:51:17] it's not even what you are on the
[1:51:18] outside that makes you who you are it's
[1:51:21] what you are on the inside
[1:51:23] it's what's going on in your soul life
[1:51:25] in your spirit life he said and you'll
[1:51:27] never be able to join churches and get
[1:51:29] that out of you
[1:51:31] you'll still be a church member and make
[1:51:34] fun of people who preach against such
[1:51:36] immorals
[1:51:38] you've got to be born again from above
[1:51:41] then you are new creatures in christ
[1:51:44] jesus and you're as abraham was you're
[1:51:47] his children you are seeking a city
[1:51:51] whose builder and maker is god
[1:51:54] that's why you act different
[1:51:58] that's why you see
[1:52:00] things different how how many times do
[1:52:04] you feel like beating your head on the
[1:52:06] wall because you can't get a co-worker
[1:52:10] to see it like you see it
[1:52:13] how many of you feel like that some
[1:52:15] even with your own family
[1:52:17] you just try to present a different
[1:52:19] alternative of thought and and
[1:52:22] it's like you're speaking a foreign
[1:52:24] language to them
[1:52:25] they can't even begin to understand i've
[1:52:28] heard ben and different ones talk about
[1:52:30] folks they work with and things that
[1:52:32] they've said and things they look they
[1:52:35] think it's ridiculous
[1:52:37] listen
[1:52:38] one example they think it's ridiculous
[1:52:41] for a woman to stay at home with her
[1:52:44] children
[1:52:46] why wouldn't everybody in the whole wide
[1:52:49] world want to have two incomes
[1:52:52] they can't understand it
[1:52:54] why the government free
[1:52:57] they use your text money and and put
[1:53:01] programs into existence to watch after
[1:53:04] your children and to school your
[1:53:06] children and take care of your children
[1:53:09] and teach them all they need to know why
[1:53:12] would a mother a smart woman a creative
[1:53:16] woman why would she want to stay home
[1:53:18] with her children and waste who she is
[1:53:24] when she could be making as much money
[1:53:26] as her husband in today's society and
[1:53:28] they could be living twice assumptiously
[1:53:31] now
[1:53:32] you can't fault people for that
[1:53:35] that's the kingdom that they are
[1:53:36] citizens of
[1:53:38] that is exactly the common thinking of
[1:53:41] the kingdom of this world
[1:53:43] you you'll never you're never going to
[1:53:46] cause them to see things your way until
[1:53:48] they have experienced what you have
[1:53:50] experienced and that is that great new
[1:53:54] birth that translates us from the
[1:53:56] kingdom of the world to the kingdom of
[1:53:58] god it takes us out of the kingdom of
[1:54:01] darkness into the kingdom of light and
[1:54:03] it changes the way we think
[1:54:06] it changes the way we speak it changes
[1:54:08] the way we live it changes the way we
[1:54:11] look at things
[1:54:12] it changes the way we behave the way we
[1:54:14] act the way we dress
[1:54:17] everything we do is a different order
[1:54:20] than the world around us
[1:54:22] if you know i'm telling the truth maybe
[1:54:24] you squeeze out a little amen instead of
[1:54:26] a blank stare just a small one maybe
[1:54:28] just nod your head just a little bit and
[1:54:31] perhaps understand
[1:54:33] you can work with them and you can talk
[1:54:35] to them
[1:54:37] you can try to convince them
[1:54:40] they'll never see your politics
[1:54:43] they'll never see your way of doing
[1:54:44] economics
[1:54:46] because you're operating on the dynamics
[1:54:48] of another kingdom all together
[1:54:51] and they say why my goodness your why
[1:54:54] what makes a woman think she's qualified
[1:54:56] to teach her children
[1:54:58] why shouldn't they be why it ought to be
[1:55:00] a law they ought to make they ought to
[1:55:01] come and force the children to don't
[1:55:04] worry
[1:55:06] don't worry
[1:55:07] if they can force you to take something
[1:55:09] in your body that you choose not to have
[1:55:11] in your body or fire you on the spot
[1:55:14] don't worry
[1:55:16] the day will also come that they'll come
[1:55:18] for your children it's a truth
[1:55:21] and they'll say well how how is it that
[1:55:22] you think you can have them at home they
[1:55:24] belong in school it's the law
[1:55:27] and you may look at me like that'll
[1:55:28] never happen it's already happened in
[1:55:30] foreign countries it's already happened
[1:55:31] in europe and it has happened in certain
[1:55:34] states in america
[1:55:36] where homeschoolers have been greatly
[1:55:39] persecuted
[1:55:41] in fact a large group of church of god
[1:55:44] people moved out of the states and into
[1:55:47] canada because they were tired of being
[1:55:50] oppressed in the practice of their
[1:55:51] religion their holiness in nature
[1:55:55] they don't believe in in tongues and
[1:55:58] gifts operating like that but they dress
[1:56:00] very conservative and live
[1:56:02] very conservative and they homeschool
[1:56:05] their children they teach them at home
[1:56:06] and they were being so persecuted in the
[1:56:08] northern states of this country that
[1:56:11] they moved to canada and these same
[1:56:13] people are the ones you're seeing in the
[1:56:14] news right now who have been arrested
[1:56:17] who have been imprisoned who have been
[1:56:19] fined hundreds of thousands of dollars
[1:56:22] in canada because they continued to have
[1:56:24] services during the lockdown
[1:56:26] so they thought if we can just get out
[1:56:28] of america we'll have freedom
[1:56:31] so they get to canada and it was worse
[1:56:33] it has been worse we don't know of
[1:56:36] people suffering in this country during
[1:56:39] the lockdown like those people have
[1:56:41] suffered the pastor's not arrested once
[1:56:44] but multiple times and find over a half
[1:56:46] a million dollars in one court case a
[1:56:50] half a million dollars and you know what
[1:56:53] they just went right on going
[1:56:55] padlocked the church door
[1:56:57] so they met out in the grass
[1:56:59] some of you have seen some of it at
[1:57:01] least in social media these are people
[1:57:04] who left this country because they were
[1:57:06] being harassed over home school
[1:57:08] so don't you think we're immune
[1:57:11] that kingdom out there is never going to
[1:57:14] understand the kingdom of god
[1:57:16] only when they have the birth you've had
[1:57:19] only if they're born again of the spirit
[1:57:21] of god so if you care anything about
[1:57:24] them it's not your politics you need to
[1:57:27] talk with them
[1:57:30] it's not all the things we're against
[1:57:33] that you need to talk to them
[1:57:35] what if i told you it's not even brother
[1:57:37] branham you need to sell to them
[1:57:41] you need to talk to them about what it
[1:57:43] means to be born again
[1:57:47] but you'll never have any influence with
[1:57:50] them if they see that your life is just
[1:57:54] like theirs
[1:57:56] if all you talk about is movies
[1:58:03] if all you talk about is video games
[1:58:06] if all you talk about is sports
[1:58:10] then they're going to say well there's
[1:58:12] no different than we are
[1:58:14] but if you find ways and i don't mean i
[1:58:16] don't think i have to say this to this
[1:58:18] church but i don't mean be religious
[1:58:21] i don't mean you have to talk like like
[1:58:23] i've heard people talk before praise the
[1:58:24] lord thank you jesus glory to god i just
[1:58:26] want to talk to you about your soul
[1:58:27] praise the lord glory to god like to see
[1:58:28] you come hallelujah thank you jesus like
[1:58:30] to invite you to come glory to god come
[1:58:33] to my church
[1:58:36] they're going to offer you a nerve pill
[1:58:40] they're not going to understand that
[1:58:43] you've just got to go live a humble life
[1:58:45] brother branham said just go live a
[1:58:46] humble christian life in front of him
[1:58:49] just be salty
[1:58:51] [Music]
[1:58:53] you don't go to work flying your trump
[1:58:55] flag
[1:58:58] come on
[1:59:00] i appreciate what we've had
[1:59:03] but that's not how you're going to win
[1:59:05] people to christ
[1:59:06] come on
[1:59:08] come on
[1:59:09] you might ought to consider that
[1:59:11] confederate flag on your vehicle
[1:59:13] although i'm not i'm not opposed to the
[1:59:15] existence of such a flag because it's a
[1:59:17] part of our history
[1:59:19] but you're going to greatly reduce your
[1:59:21] ability to minister to certain groups of
[1:59:23] people
[1:59:24] if you're flying in the in the work
[1:59:26] parking lot
[1:59:30] oh
[1:59:33] sometimes you've got to use a little
[1:59:34] wisdom
[1:59:36] because your main purpose in life
[1:59:39] the reason why you're here
[1:59:42] is not so you can keep feeding your 401
[1:59:46] your main purpose for being here is to
[1:59:49] be a light in a dark world to be salt so
[1:59:53] that they become thirsty around us
[1:59:55] to to to manifest that jesus has the
[1:59:59] preeminence in your life and do it in a
[2:00:01] non-religious way but in a very
[2:00:04] powerful way
[2:00:06] because the bible tells us here that the
[2:00:08] that the kingdom
[2:00:10] of god in first corinthians chapter 4
[2:00:13] verse 20 first corinthians 4 20 for the
[2:00:16] kingdom of god is not in word
[2:00:20] but in power
[2:00:24] one of the things i appreciate about
[2:00:26] brother robert's prayer request
[2:00:29] and his testimonies that he gives us
[2:00:31] some time from his workplace
[2:00:33] is because he's made enough of an
[2:00:35] influence over there that when people
[2:00:37] need prayer
[2:00:38] they're reaching out to him
[2:00:41] i was in a restaurant eating last sunday
[2:00:43] and and they came in the restaurant with
[2:00:45] a gentleman that he used to work with
[2:00:48] and they sit down at a table they speak
[2:00:49] to us but they sit down in a table with
[2:00:52] a gentleman that he works with and it
[2:00:54] warmed my heart they interstopped and
[2:00:56] introduced him to their pastor but it
[2:00:58] warmed my heart
[2:00:59] i thought that's exactly oh god help me
[2:01:02] because the lord knows i'd rather be
[2:01:04] with church folks than anybody
[2:01:06] but
[2:01:07] my heart was warmed and i thought my how
[2:01:10] wonderful they can have a relationship
[2:01:12] with somebody like that who may need to
[2:01:14] hear something other than what they can
[2:01:17] hear on fox news
[2:01:20] or see an end
[2:01:22] maybe they need some good news presented
[2:01:25] to them
[2:01:26] not in word only but in power and in
[2:01:29] demonstration
[2:01:31] how many of you understand what i'm
[2:01:33] saying
[2:01:34] i know you do
[2:01:37] uh
[2:01:38] go back to my quote if you will you've
[2:01:39] got to be born again from above
[2:01:42] did we finish that
[2:01:44] then your new creatures
[2:01:46] yes in christ jesus
[2:01:48] you see things different
[2:01:53] the end of 21 there we go
[2:01:56] you see things different
[2:01:59] that's why you see things different
[2:02:02] that's why you act different that's why
[2:02:03] you see things different you never get
[2:02:06] customized to this world
[2:02:09] because you're from above
[2:02:12] and here is a is a convicting truth
[2:02:16] you act like the kingdom you belong in
[2:02:23] if you're acting like the world around
[2:02:25] you
[2:02:26] then you're you're you're acting as
[2:02:27] though that's the world you belong in
[2:02:29] the kingdom you belong in if you're a
[2:02:32] part of the kingdom of god you're going
[2:02:33] to act like citizens
[2:02:36] of an entirely different kingdom
[2:02:38] oh come on i'm not talking about being
[2:02:40] religious i'm talking about being real
[2:02:43] in the message the future home
[2:02:45] i'm mentioning this because i want to
[2:02:47] bring the balance
[2:02:49] to the born-again thing
[2:02:50] we have to be born again you've got to
[2:02:52] be born again if you're not born from
[2:02:54] above you're lost
[2:02:56] if you're not born to the water and of
[2:02:57] the spirit you're not a born-again
[2:02:59] christian you're not a child of god you
[2:03:01] have to come that way it's it's a choice
[2:03:03] there's repentance that has to take
[2:03:05] place you're baptized you must be
[2:03:08] baptized
[2:03:09] but brother branham brings a glorious
[2:03:11] balance here
[2:03:12] he said there is your only convocation
[2:03:15] not have anything to do with the literal
[2:03:17] things it's beyond that it's into the
[2:03:19] kingdom of god
[2:03:22] with eternal life
[2:03:24] with the predestinated that never did
[2:03:27] start
[2:03:28] it never started on any day
[2:03:32] you wasn't saved on any day
[2:03:39] you was always saved
[2:03:41] amen
[2:03:43] we used to say since calvary
[2:03:46] and then we had an understanding
[2:03:49] that calvary paid the price
[2:03:52] but it started way before calvary
[2:03:56] in eternity passed in the mind of god he
[2:04:00] saved his
[2:04:02] you wasn't saved on any day he was
[2:04:04] always saved amen jesus just come to
[2:04:06] redeem that
[2:04:08] but you were saved from the beginning
[2:04:09] because you had eternal life to begin
[2:04:13] with
[2:04:14] now that places of balance there
[2:04:17] meaning he already knew who was going to
[2:04:19] be
[2:04:20] and potentially in the mind of god you
[2:04:22] always were but had he not come are you
[2:04:25] with me
[2:04:26] had he not come
[2:04:29] paid the prize i went to bed at 11
[2:04:30] o'clock last night
[2:04:33] it's an amazing amazing
[2:04:36] thing i just suggest it to all of you
[2:04:41] then you're awake at six
[2:04:43] and you're ready to take on the day
[2:04:47] anybody with me
[2:04:49] you'd be a whole lot fresher on sunday
[2:04:51] if you'd get in the bed at a decent time
[2:04:53] on saturday night somebody said there
[2:04:55] they are trying to control everything
[2:04:57] now oh no we're just trying to give you
[2:04:59] some practical ex reasons
[2:05:01] to get everything you can get
[2:05:04] come on like granny said get all you can
[2:05:06] can't all you get
[2:05:08] cause one day you're gonna need it
[2:05:11] jesus just come to redeem that but you
[2:05:12] were saved from the beginning because
[2:05:14] you had eternal life to begin with well
[2:05:16] you may not believe that but with
[2:05:18] everything i am
[2:05:20] i believe that i believe i'm saved today
[2:05:22] because i always was i believe i'm born
[2:05:25] again today because i yielded to christ
[2:05:27] coming for me to redeem me he called me
[2:05:30] and i answered and i chose him
[2:05:36] i chose him
[2:05:38] because he chose me
[2:05:40] that's what the word said
[2:05:42] matthew 4 23 look at that with me and
[2:05:44] i'll hurry
[2:05:47] jesus went about all galilee
[2:05:50] teaching in their synagogues
[2:05:52] and preaching
[2:05:54] the gospel of the kingdom
[2:05:59] and healing all manner of sickness
[2:06:02] and all manner of disease
[2:06:05] among the people
[2:06:07] now i believe that brother branham
[2:06:08] ministered in a in a dispensation in an
[2:06:12] era of time where where the truth of
[2:06:15] god's word was being demonstrated with
[2:06:17] divine healing in a profound way the son
[2:06:20] of man is risen with healing in his
[2:06:22] wings i believe that
[2:06:24] i believe there were healings on a
[2:06:25] broader scale among even unbelievers
[2:06:28] among people who weren't even christian
[2:06:30] but they heard the simplicity of trust
[2:06:33] god believe god
[2:06:35] come and be healed
[2:06:38] brother
[2:06:39] john hall an old friend of mine
[2:06:42] from tucson
[2:06:44] sends me things all the time i
[2:06:46] appreciate it so much
[2:06:48] and he has done a lot of research
[2:06:51] and he has sent me a multiple multiple
[2:06:55] advertisements
[2:06:57] that i've never seen before even though
[2:06:59] you can find some of them in the
[2:07:02] in the app
[2:07:05] i got to look i can't remember what
[2:07:06] that's called sorry
[2:07:10] you know you can see what what was today
[2:07:12] in fact today was i saw where brother
[2:07:14] gossman posted that today is the day
[2:07:16] that lifeline is the app i was talking
[2:07:18] about i saw where today is the day that
[2:07:20] the ohio river crested just like it was
[2:07:22] prophesied that it would during the
[2:07:24] flood that ended up taking uh the life
[2:07:27] of of uh
[2:07:28] sister branham and and hope
[2:07:31] but uh you can go there sometimes and
[2:07:34] see advertisements of meetings where
[2:07:36] brother brandon was preaching and i like
[2:07:38] that i enjoy seeing those brother john
[2:07:40] hall has done some searching through
[2:07:43] uh
[2:07:44] archives and you used to have to do it
[2:07:46] on micro fish or microfilm but now you
[2:07:48] can access it online and he'll he'll
[2:07:50] take it
[2:07:51] and crop it and send it to me
[2:07:53] advertisements in various newspapers
[2:07:56] where brother branham was coming
[2:07:58] and
[2:07:58] he also has sent me some
[2:08:01] where
[2:08:02] other preachers
[2:08:04] wanted to have the same success that
[2:08:05] brother branham was having and so they
[2:08:07] would they would advertise their
[2:08:09] ministry as a ministry like william
[2:08:11] branham
[2:08:14] now isn't that something that you'd have
[2:08:15] to draw people to your meeting by by
[2:08:17] putting in the newspaper
[2:08:19] come and see a similar gift to william
[2:08:21] branham
[2:08:23] now why would somebody want to settle
[2:08:24] for that if that's the way you were
[2:08:25] selling it i just want to find where
[2:08:27] william branham was if it's going to
[2:08:29] have to be advertised like that
[2:08:31] but you'd be surprised at some of the
[2:08:32] ways the churches advertised the
[2:08:35] meetings and they would just say come
[2:08:37] come as you are
[2:08:38] come in whatever condition you are and
[2:08:40] be healed
[2:08:42] they didn't say come get saved come join
[2:08:44] the church come be baptized they just
[2:08:47] said if you're sick come be healed and
[2:08:49] you know what they were by the
[2:08:50] multitudes
[2:08:52] because it was a time of healing it was
[2:08:55] the fulfillment of a prophecy of healing
[2:08:58] the son of man had risen with healing in
[2:09:02] his wings and catholics and mennonites
[2:09:05] and
[2:09:06] all
[2:09:06] episcopalians and whatever else would
[2:09:09] come to those meetings and receive
[2:09:10] healing in their body go right back to
[2:09:12] their false churches
[2:09:16] because it was a thing but i want you to
[2:09:18] know we may not be living in that hour
[2:09:21] but i want you to also know healing is
[2:09:24] the children's bread
[2:09:26] we don't have to say well
[2:09:28] since this isn't the time of healing
[2:09:30] we're now over here much farther along
[2:09:32] in the word then we just have to l no no
[2:09:34] no no no
[2:09:36] we should be going after healing for our
[2:09:39] own bodies and for those we love like we
[2:09:42] always have because he's the same
[2:09:45] yesterday and today and forever
[2:09:49] we should be claiming and believing
[2:09:52] that we are healed with his stripes
[2:09:55] even though that may not be the emphasis
[2:09:57] of this hour how many of you believe
[2:09:59] he's still a healer
[2:10:01] how many let me see the hand of those
[2:10:03] who say they've been healed you you have
[2:10:05] had god heal you sometime in your life
[2:10:07] let me see your hand
[2:10:08] you know he's healed you
[2:10:10] that he's still the same
[2:10:13] don't you let anybody talk you out of
[2:10:15] believing god for whatever you need
[2:10:17] because jesus went about in all galilee
[2:10:20] teaching in their synagogues and
[2:10:21] preaching the gospel of the kingdom and
[2:10:23] healing all manner of sickness and all
[2:10:25] manner of disease among the people and
[2:10:27] we read a moment ago for the kingdom of
[2:10:29] god it's not in word but it's in power
[2:10:33] it's such a powerful truth
[2:10:36] and in luke 9 give me that one
[2:10:38] luke 9 1 and 2
[2:10:41] i'm not not quite done here
[2:10:44] but if i cast out devils
[2:10:47] no excuse me that's uh
[2:10:49] that is matthew 12 28 i'll get to that
[2:10:51] one another time
[2:10:52] luke 9 1-2 then he called his 12
[2:10:55] disciples together and gave them power
[2:10:59] and authority
[2:11:02] over the low-level devils
[2:11:07] all devils
[2:11:09] whoa
[2:11:10] no wonder they got a little carried away
[2:11:12] them disciples
[2:11:14] they had power and authority over all
[2:11:16] devils and to cure diseases hallelujah
[2:11:19] and he sent them to preach
[2:11:23] what
[2:11:25] the kingdom of god
[2:11:27] and to heal the sick
[2:11:28] i want you to think about the condition
[2:11:30] of the day i want you to think about
[2:11:31] roman occupation
[2:11:33] i want you to think about the suffering
[2:11:34] of the jewish people in this hour as
[2:11:36] rome had come in to occupy jerusalem
[2:11:39] and they were trying to turn it into a
[2:11:41] an entire roman conquest
[2:11:44] they were going to just make it an
[2:11:46] off branch of rome they they desired to
[2:11:49] do to wipe out all judaism you
[2:11:51] understand they didn't want any anybody
[2:11:53] carrying on any of the traditions or
[2:11:56] fulfilling any of the scriptures of the
[2:11:57] jewish faith they wanted to just wipe it
[2:11:59] as clean as they possibly could
[2:12:02] they wanted any any thing that had to do
[2:12:04] with judaism they wanted to wipe that
[2:12:06] completely out so the people were very
[2:12:08] very oppressed
[2:12:10] and all they knew was what it was like
[2:12:12] to live in a in a place that was
[2:12:14] occupied by by the roman kingdom or the
[2:12:17] roman empire we might use those words
[2:12:19] interchangeably here and jesus
[2:12:22] did not come to preach against
[2:12:25] the roman empire
[2:12:29] if he had
[2:12:31] he would have had larger crowds
[2:12:37] if he would have come to do a trump
[2:12:38] rally
[2:12:42] president trump valley
[2:12:45] if that's if that would have been the
[2:12:46] theme of his ministry there would have
[2:12:48] been a whole lot more that came than did
[2:12:50] come already to come
[2:12:53] because the people were looking for
[2:12:54] deliverance from the oppression of the
[2:12:56] occupying force
[2:12:58] we want to get out from under rome
[2:13:00] and if jesus would have come promising
[2:13:02] all that and and spending all of his
[2:13:04] time focusing on that then there might
[2:13:07] have been bigger crowds but how many of
[2:13:09] you know that wasn't the purpose that he
[2:13:10] was represented in the earth he didn't
[2:13:12] come to express that he came to express
[2:13:15] god
[2:13:16] and the heart of god for the earth so
[2:13:19] when he preached he didn't preach
[2:13:21] against spend all of his time preaching
[2:13:23] against rome
[2:13:25] he didn't even spend all of his time
[2:13:26] preaching against the synagogue
[2:13:29] although he had to call out on many
[2:13:31] occasion the hypocrisy
[2:13:34] and mention specifically those who were
[2:13:37] of their father the devil
[2:13:39] he did have to do that in the balance of
[2:13:41] his preaching but he came to preach the
[2:13:44] kingdom of god
[2:13:47] lives are changed when we understand
[2:13:50] that we're a part of the kingdom of god
[2:13:54] there's a great contrast between what we
[2:13:58] know and understand around us
[2:14:01] and what we carry in us
[2:14:03] because even in the time of jesus we're
[2:14:06] told that his kingdom
[2:14:08] was not with a physical throne
[2:14:11] in a palace in jerusalem
[2:14:14] but his kingdom
[2:14:15] was
[2:14:16] in the hearts of men
[2:14:20] the kingdom of god was established in
[2:14:23] the hearts of men the roman occupation
[2:14:25] it just kept going on
[2:14:27] until finally it destroyed the city of
[2:14:29] jerusalem and burned the holy temple and
[2:14:31] so forth after christ
[2:14:33] had already gone
[2:14:35] so his coming didn't do too much to
[2:14:37] change the political environment
[2:14:40] no no no
[2:14:41] because he wasn't here to preach another
[2:14:43] political kingdom
[2:14:45] he was here to preach and demonstrate
[2:14:47] the kingdom of god and when he sent the
[2:14:49] disciples forth he sent them forth to
[2:14:51] preach the kingdom of god
[2:14:54] and that means their whole focus was not
[2:14:56] kingdom of heaven
[2:14:59] because that was a future experience and
[2:15:01] expression
[2:15:02] when we get to heaven we know
[2:15:04] everything's going to be all right
[2:15:06] i want you to know we're not there yet
[2:15:09] we got to have something to hope in now
[2:15:10] we have to have something to hold on to
[2:15:12] now we need the kingdom of god among us
[2:15:15] now we need to understand who we are in
[2:15:17] the kingdom now
[2:15:19] we need to think like kingdom people now
[2:15:22] not the kingdom of the earth the kingdom
[2:15:24] of our god
[2:15:26] hallelujah
[2:15:28] so he sent his disciples out to preach
[2:15:30] the kingdom of god i'm just going to
[2:15:31] throw this in
[2:15:33] this is a quote that i
[2:15:35] slipped in here for you
[2:15:37] it's from the message the angel of god
[2:15:40] this is not the only time he said it but
[2:15:42] i just wanted to reinforce to you
[2:15:44] what what jesus is demonstrating here by
[2:15:47] calling men to preach the kingdom he
[2:15:50] said now god could have sent the angel
[2:15:52] down couldn't he
[2:15:53] he could have let the angel come himself
[2:15:56] but instead of that he sent the angel to
[2:15:59] speak through the voice
[2:16:02] read it of a man
[2:16:05] god always used man
[2:16:10] for his work
[2:16:11] is that right
[2:16:13] he don't use organizations or so forth
[2:16:15] and mechanical devices
[2:16:21] but he uses men
[2:16:25] just say what he said
[2:16:28] say what he said
[2:16:30] he uses men
[2:16:32] now that doesn't mean
[2:16:34] that we can't have our lives forever
[2:16:36] changed
[2:16:38] by hearing god's voice
[2:16:40] recorded for us
[2:16:42] on a mechanical device
[2:16:44] but the debate is getting wilder
[2:16:47] it's getting wilder
[2:16:50] out there
[2:16:52] social media the debate is getting
[2:16:53] wilder
[2:16:54] because of the new movement press play
[2:16:56] and obey
[2:16:59] and i tell you i want you to know it's
[2:17:01] getting very very serious because some
[2:17:03] people are forgetting
[2:17:06] that the the new testament tells us the
[2:17:08] only way that the church is going to
[2:17:11] come to the perfection that she's
[2:17:12] promised to come to in the last days the
[2:17:15] only way that's going to happen is
[2:17:16] because there'll be a fivefold ministry
[2:17:21] we must have it
[2:17:23] now we should stay with the word we
[2:17:25] should stay with the message that god
[2:17:27] has given us i'm not saying anything
[2:17:28] contrary to that
[2:17:32] but we need more than just a recording
[2:17:36] and we need more than just a machine we
[2:17:38] need men
[2:17:40] and women who will live the truth
[2:17:44] that's been recorded on those machines
[2:17:48] because everybody's not going to spend
[2:17:50] the hours that you and i have spent
[2:17:52] listening to messages
[2:17:54] everybody's not going to do that until
[2:17:56] they're until they get it
[2:17:59] you you suggest someone out there listen
[2:18:02] to brother branham and you pick one of
[2:18:04] them three-hour sermons
[2:18:06] and in all likelihood they don't make it
[2:18:08] through ten minutes
[2:18:11] well look at you you can hardly make it
[2:18:12] through two hours on sunday yourself
[2:18:16] not like we used to
[2:18:19] and so they're they're waiting for
[2:18:21] somebody to live something
[2:18:24] then you start pointing them
[2:18:26] to where you ate so good
[2:18:29] show them what has changed your life
[2:18:32] give them some of the food that has made
[2:18:34] you strong in this late hour
[2:18:37] but god uses men
[2:18:39] now i hope you'll hear me now
[2:18:41] i want to close in a few moments with
[2:18:43] this thought
[2:18:44] in the message faith in the son of god
[2:18:48] hammond indiana
[2:18:50] brother banham said i don't know what
[2:18:51] the future holds
[2:18:54] but i know who holds the future
[2:18:56] that's the main thing i know that he
[2:18:58] holds all the future and whatever mind
[2:19:00] shall be it's in his hands
[2:19:03] so each day i want to live
[2:19:06] not
[2:19:08] for myself
[2:19:12] in the kingdom of men
[2:19:14] it's dog eat dog
[2:19:17] and it's nobody cares who they step on
[2:19:21] climbing the ladder of success
[2:19:23] but in the kingdom of god we are not
[2:19:25] living for ourselves
[2:19:28] we're living for others
[2:19:29] is that right god help us
[2:19:32] he said if i live for myself
[2:19:35] moving on
[2:19:36] if i live for myself
[2:19:39] i live a selfish life
[2:19:41] i want to live for others
[2:19:43] and give what strength i have
[2:19:46] not to myself and to my own pleasure
[2:19:50] read it for me
[2:19:54] that'll build
[2:19:57] the kingdom of god
[2:20:00] living for others
[2:20:02] will build the kingdom of god
[2:20:06] how many kingdom builders are here today
[2:20:08] we all must be
[2:20:11] a third of us raised our hand but we all
[2:20:13] must be
[2:20:15] if we're born into that kingdom then
[2:20:17] it's our responsibility to help build
[2:20:19] that kingdom
[2:20:21] and in order to do so we have to make up
[2:20:23] our minds i'm no longer going to live
[2:20:25] for myself
[2:20:27] to protect my own interests only
[2:20:30] but i'm going to live for the interest
[2:20:31] of others
[2:20:33] come on now
[2:20:35] yes
[2:20:36] may god help us to do that
[2:20:39] it's easy to say and harder to live it
[2:20:41] out
[2:20:42] in the mighty conqueror
[2:20:47] he said you can't conquer by wrong
[2:20:50] only right will conquer
[2:20:52] you'll never conquer by cheating
[2:20:56] you'll never conquer by proselyting in
[2:20:58] your church
[2:20:59] you'll never conquer by building up one
[2:21:01] denomination above another
[2:21:03] why would you do that they're all
[2:21:04] corrupt
[2:21:06] he said you'll only conquer as you let
[2:21:07] down the bars
[2:21:09] and let the holy spirit come in to the
[2:21:11] entire body of christ
[2:21:14] the limits that you've tried to put on
[2:21:16] god in this house
[2:21:17] he's not going to tolerate that forever
[2:21:21] because he sees a hungry people
[2:21:23] and when god recognizes a hungry people
[2:21:26] he has committed himself to meet those
[2:21:28] people he'll meet you
[2:21:29] we only conquer as you let down the bars
[2:21:31] and let the holy spirit come in to the
[2:21:33] entire body of christ we'll never
[2:21:35] conquer as long as we're selfish
[2:21:38] god hates sin
[2:21:40] and he will not let it triumph over
[2:21:43] wrong
[2:21:45] in the message the queen of the south
[2:21:49] you see what pride and selfishness does
[2:21:53] it shuts you out from the kingdom of god
[2:21:57] the kingdom you're born into
[2:22:00] and yet you allow that selfishness and
[2:22:02] pride to rise up in your heart and it
[2:22:04] separates you from the very kingdom of
[2:22:06] your birth
[2:22:08] and so to get back to where you were
[2:22:10] born you have to fight your way back but
[2:22:13] how many of you know it's worth the
[2:22:14] fight
[2:22:15] to kill the pride
[2:22:18] to defeat the selfishness it's worth it
[2:22:21] by the grace of god to help us get back
[2:22:24] to the kingdom where we were born
[2:22:26] it shuts you out from the kingdom of god
[2:22:29] he said i wonder sometime as we think
[2:22:31] what will happen
[2:22:32] to this generation has that thought ever
[2:22:34] crossed your mind
[2:22:36] christ has identified in all generations
[2:22:41] we all believe in the coming of the lord
[2:22:44] that is coming as soon at hand we
[2:22:46] believe it's at hand now we don't know
[2:22:48] just what time it'll be that he will
[2:22:50] arrive
[2:22:52] in view of this
[2:22:53] we want to put forth every effort that
[2:22:56] we know how to further the kingdom
[2:23:00] and get that last person saved
[2:23:05] into the kingdom
[2:23:07] one of these days
[2:23:09] the last one
[2:23:12] the last one hallelujah the last one is
[2:23:18] going to hear the call
[2:23:20] to be born from above
[2:23:21] and when that last one is saved there
[2:23:24] will not be one extra
[2:23:28] it's a number
[2:23:30] it's a number that we don't know
[2:23:33] we know exactly how many jewish
[2:23:36] evangelists will be raised up and sealed
[2:23:38] in the last day 144 thousand
[2:23:41] but we have no idea what number
[2:23:44] will be the last one
[2:23:48] saved under the gentile dispensation but
[2:23:50] one day the last one
[2:23:52] they're going to see it on a program
[2:23:54] they're going to they're going to hear
[2:23:56] it in a on youtube they're going to
[2:23:59] they're gonna find it in a little church
[2:24:00] somewhere they're gonna work with
[2:24:02] somebody who's got something
[2:24:05] who doesn't just talk something but
[2:24:08] they've got something and they get so
[2:24:10] hungry they want it
[2:24:12] and they call out the god
[2:24:14] [Laughter]
[2:24:16] they pray through
[2:24:19] and god says
[2:24:22] not another one
[2:24:24] the last one
[2:24:27] that he had on his mind
[2:24:29] saved
[2:24:31] and we're out of here
[2:24:32] there'll not be one extra it'll just be
[2:24:34] so many and when that last one is
[2:24:36] brought in the body of christ is
[2:24:37] completed the rapture will come if
[2:24:41] anybody believes that say amen
[2:24:43] can i read one more
[2:24:45] two more three more
[2:24:47] four more
[2:24:48] a total deliverance
[2:24:51] i didn't print these out somewhere i dug
[2:24:53] for them
[2:24:54] and so for me they're jewels
[2:24:56] for me every one of them is like gold
[2:24:58] because it takes a little effort to find
[2:25:00] them and get them but once i get them oh
[2:25:03] my i'm happy about them i'm proud of
[2:25:05] them i am because i think that sometimes
[2:25:08] he can say it a whole lot better than
[2:25:09] what i could even try
[2:25:11] jesus was completely
[2:25:14] totally man
[2:25:16] you know this
[2:25:17] he could cry like a man he could eat
[2:25:19] like a man he could be tired like a man
[2:25:21] he was completely totally man in his
[2:25:24] physical being i want you to hear that
[2:25:26] again completely totally
[2:25:30] man
[2:25:32] in his physical being his flesh
[2:25:35] was man
[2:25:37] this is not what everybody teaches
[2:25:40] and in his spirit
[2:25:42] he was completely totally
[2:25:45] god
[2:25:48] i've heard the apostolics preach that
[2:25:49] his flesh even his flesh was deity even
[2:25:52] his flesh was god
[2:25:54] then he was god god
[2:25:58] he was a god man
[2:26:00] he was god living in a man's body
[2:26:03] why would he do it that way
[2:26:06] so i would see how possible it really is
[2:26:11] and in his spirit he was completely
[2:26:12] totally god so he made his flesh
[2:26:14] submissive
[2:26:16] to the spirit that was in him
[2:26:18] you think jesus is only one sister
[2:26:20] bonnie that has to do that i just saw
[2:26:21] your nod and i thought i'd call your
[2:26:23] name you think he's the only one
[2:26:26] you think he's the only one that has to
[2:26:27] do that every one of us have to do that
[2:26:29] every one of us have to push down the
[2:26:31] flesh
[2:26:32] and cause that flesh to be submissive to
[2:26:34] the will of the spirit
[2:26:35] or we'd all be holy rollers on sunday
[2:26:37] morning
[2:26:39] we'd just roll over
[2:26:42] stay in the bed
[2:26:44] you see he was tempted in all manner
[2:26:45] like we are he was a man not an angel he
[2:26:48] was a man he had desires and temptations
[2:26:50] just like we do the bible said he did he
[2:26:52] was a man not an angel above temptation
[2:26:55] hebrews 1 said that he was hebrews 1 4
[2:26:57] said he was made lower
[2:27:00] than the angels
[2:27:02] he was man completely man
[2:27:05] that god took a complete man to bring
[2:27:07] total deliverance
[2:27:09] and he filled him with his spirit
[2:27:12] the holy ghost was in him without
[2:27:13] measure
[2:27:19] the holy ghost was in him without
[2:27:21] measure
[2:27:22] and he was tempted like we were
[2:27:24] you be careful what you say about
[2:27:26] somebody not having the holy ghost
[2:27:30] we used to use that on people in
[2:27:31] pentecost a lot
[2:27:34] well i thought you had the holy ghost
[2:27:39] well i thought you had the holy ghost
[2:27:41] well i thought that was your place to
[2:27:43] decide
[2:27:46] parents even sometimes use that on their
[2:27:48] children
[2:27:49] it's happened even around here in this
[2:27:51] church sometime that the young people
[2:27:53] would have a good service and they'd cry
[2:27:55] out to the lord and they'd get under the
[2:27:57] inspiration of the holy ghost and and
[2:27:58] then they would get under temptation and
[2:28:00] do something bad before midnight
[2:28:03] and the parent would say to them i
[2:28:05] understand the frustration i'm a parent
[2:28:07] i understand the frustration
[2:28:09] but then a parent would say something
[2:28:11] like that to him i thought you got a got
[2:28:13] the holy ghost i thought you had a good
[2:28:14] touch from god today i can't believe
[2:28:16] you're acting that way
[2:28:17] i want to tell you something that's not
[2:28:18] the way to discipline your children
[2:28:20] in fact if you think that's going to
[2:28:22] cause them to do what you want them to
[2:28:23] do you're wrong what that's going to do
[2:28:25] is discourage them from seeking god and
[2:28:27] let me tell you something it's not an
[2:28:29] experience or a feeling that's going to
[2:28:31] get us through but your your your
[2:28:33] children our young people need to know
[2:28:36] that they can experience god
[2:28:39] they can't have an encounter with god
[2:28:42] and they can feel him
[2:28:44] we're not living by feeling but it's
[2:28:46] wonderful
[2:28:47] to feel the presence of the lord so
[2:28:49] don't you say to somebody i thought you
[2:28:51] had the holy ghost
[2:28:56] you didn't give it
[2:29:05] somebody said i heard a man speak pretty
[2:29:06] harshly to his wife and then i heard him
[2:29:08] speak in tongues in church that couldn't
[2:29:10] have been god
[2:29:15] i don't think it's right to speak
[2:29:16] harshly
[2:29:18] i'm not saying that at all
[2:29:22] since i was standing in tucson with
[2:29:24] sister rebecca and she told me sometime
[2:29:25] that brother branham could get pretty
[2:29:27] aggravated with sister meda
[2:29:30] why because he was a man
[2:29:34] because he was a human
[2:29:36] because she got on his nerves
[2:29:40] i'm preaching that with extra passion
[2:29:42] aren't i
[2:29:43] i understand it don't discourage me
[2:29:46] somebody said well sister rebecca can
[2:29:48] you remember
[2:29:49] an example
[2:29:53] don't you brothers use this as an excuse
[2:29:59] she said they said sister rebecca can
[2:30:01] you think of an example of a time that
[2:30:03] you saw brother branham get very
[2:30:05] aggravated
[2:30:06] out of sorts with sister branham and and
[2:30:08] and speak to her in a harsh way
[2:30:11] and she said oh yes i can think of many
[2:30:13] many examples
[2:30:15] but one that i remember the most
[2:30:17] would you be willing to tell us they
[2:30:19] said oh yeah i'll tell you
[2:30:21] because she said if you know who my
[2:30:22] daddy was and you understand the
[2:30:24] ministry god give him it'll it won't it
[2:30:26] won't shake you either way you'll know
[2:30:28] he was just a man he struggled like all
[2:30:30] other men but he got the victory
[2:30:33] and she said
[2:30:35] the one i remember is he got
[2:30:38] real disturbed
[2:30:40] when my mother burnt his toast
[2:30:47] no men no men amen
[2:30:51] we cannot receive any male amens at this
[2:30:54] moment
[2:30:57] refrain you'll never hear me say hold
[2:30:59] your amen but i'm going to tell you hold
[2:31:00] it right now because you've got to go
[2:31:02] home with a little wife you know
[2:31:05] and i thought i'm standing there
[2:31:06] thinking to myself
[2:31:10] i can't even fathom that
[2:31:13] you know why
[2:31:15] i like extra dark toast
[2:31:22] the other night we were having a meal
[2:31:23] for those that were helping work and and
[2:31:25] and they overcooked some of the rolls or
[2:31:27] something charity said those are pastors
[2:31:31] everybody else would have grabbed the
[2:31:32] other ones but those would have been the
[2:31:34] one so i can't relate to that
[2:31:36] but i've got my own
[2:31:40] ben was that you
[2:31:43] okay we can have the male amens back
[2:31:46] i got my own it's not right
[2:31:49] we need to get the victory over that
[2:31:52] the greatest thing god has given us
[2:31:53] other than our salvation is our wife
[2:31:56] we should treat them with love and
[2:31:58] respect
[2:31:59] this is not to justify that nor to to
[2:32:02] vilify brother branham or delore him in
[2:32:04] any way it's just to say we have our
[2:32:06] frustration if anybody had the holy
[2:32:09] ghost
[2:32:10] i know he had the holy ghost
[2:32:13] but he locked his toast a certain way
[2:32:16] and she went on to tell us that mama had
[2:32:19] a way of getting him
[2:32:22] poked
[2:32:24] and when they were having a little
[2:32:26] disagreement about something i've
[2:32:27] noticed the toast would be extra brown
[2:32:29] the next morning
[2:32:35] oh you sisters listen
[2:32:41] she was
[2:32:43] [Music]
[2:32:44] let's close
[2:32:47] she was human too
[2:32:50] she was that's below the belt
[2:32:53] she was using toast to get her point
[2:32:55] across
[2:32:57] you'd need me more than you realize i'll
[2:32:59] burn your toast from now on you know
[2:33:03] jesus had the holy ghost without measure
[2:33:06] in him and he was tempted like we are
[2:33:10] like we were and he was completely god
[2:33:14] tempted in all manner as we are yet
[2:33:16] without sin
[2:33:18] come on now understand where i'm coming
[2:33:21] from
[2:33:22] he was completely god now let's go on
[2:33:26] he proved it when he raised the dead
[2:33:28] when he stopped nature the roaring seas
[2:33:31] the mighty winds when he spoke to the
[2:33:33] trees and so forth they obeyed him he
[2:33:35] was god inside
[2:33:39] and he could have
[2:33:40] and he could have been man for he was
[2:33:42] man
[2:33:44] but he totally and completely delivered
[2:33:46] himself as a man into the hands of god
[2:33:52] for the service of god
[2:33:58] but that was jesus
[2:34:00] but jesus is our example
[2:34:04] well paragraph 88 and he is our example
[2:34:08] we are men and women
[2:34:10] we're also christians if he's our
[2:34:12] example let us completely deliver
[2:34:15] ourselves into the hands of the holy
[2:34:17] ghost
[2:34:18] that we might be subjects of the kingdom
[2:34:20] of god oh my
[2:34:24] does that speak to your heart
[2:34:27] if he's our example let us completely
[2:34:29] deliver ourselves into the hands of the
[2:34:31] holy ghost that we might be subjects of
[2:34:33] the kingdom of god he was totally man he
[2:34:35] was totally god but he surrendered his
[2:34:37] natural parts
[2:34:38] his physical parts his own thinking his
[2:34:40] own doing his own cares
[2:34:43] and i don't only i do only that which
[2:34:46] pleases the father there you are totally
[2:34:47] delivered
[2:34:49] from human being
[2:34:56] the priest come to him the great men and
[2:34:58] said rabbi so and so and tried to bribe
[2:35:00] him into their affiliations and
[2:35:01] denominations
[2:35:03] but he was totally delivered
[2:35:05] because he trusted in
[2:35:08] god
[2:35:12] believe that
[2:35:22] paragraph 30.
[2:35:23] the last one i'll read i'll stop
[2:35:27] i wanted to get into something else but
[2:35:29] didn't make it there
[2:35:32] i have five definite identifications of
[2:35:33] the true church of the living god
[2:35:36] he said we have access let the musicians
[2:35:38] come and help me would you please
[2:35:40] we have access to our king
[2:35:44] we have interview with him whenever we
[2:35:46] want to call upon him
[2:35:49] we have no intercessors no other
[2:35:50] intercessors no other mediator between
[2:35:52] the king and us but that one man christ
[2:35:55] jesus so we are living in a kingdom i
[2:35:58] want you to think about what's just read
[2:36:01] it's wonderful to know that we've
[2:36:03] reached out to our pastor and he's
[2:36:04] praying for us
[2:36:07] but we don't need a mediator
[2:36:10] we don't need another intercessor
[2:36:12] this is the greatest kingdom that there
[2:36:14] has ever been because any little subject
[2:36:17] in the kingdom
[2:36:18] has access to the king 24 hours a day
[2:36:21] 365 days of the year we don't have to go
[2:36:24] we don't have to go through any other
[2:36:26] motions go through some long waiting
[2:36:28] list of the king will see you you know
[2:36:31] some of you trying to get why people
[2:36:32] trying to get coveted
[2:36:35] someone told me yesterday that didn't
[2:36:36] feel very well said i'm going to get a
[2:36:38] coverage but couldn't go until next
[2:36:40] saturday a week later well that didn't
[2:36:42] make any sense because the cdc tells you
[2:36:44] now
[2:36:45] after you've been exposed or had similar
[2:36:46] you only have five days to quarantine
[2:36:48] you go back to work
[2:36:52] remember it was 14 days
[2:36:54] then it was 10 days
[2:36:58] now in this long dark dreary
[2:37:01] deadly winter
[2:37:04] it's five days
[2:37:07] come on now
[2:37:10] scary
[2:37:11] three weeks ago ninety percent of the
[2:37:13] cases
[2:37:15] were in vaccinated people
[2:37:19] 30 percent
[2:37:20] of the cases across the board
[2:37:23] were vaccinated doubly and boosted
[2:37:28] the truth is
[2:37:29] this thing is changing so quickly
[2:37:33] i love to say this to people who don't
[2:37:36] even look at the any science about it at
[2:37:38] all
[2:37:39] and didn't really they must have skipped
[2:37:40] health in school
[2:37:42] because they didn't understand anything
[2:37:44] different about bacteria and virus
[2:37:47] they don't understand that a virus has
[2:37:48] intelligence
[2:37:51] it's like it has a brain
[2:37:53] it don't it doesn't want to kill you
[2:37:56] it wants to feast on you
[2:37:59] it was to make you dinner
[2:38:02] and so it changes itself
[2:38:04] to try to keep you alive as a host
[2:38:07] so it can go somewhere else and eat
[2:38:09] later
[2:38:10] think about this
[2:38:12] so it's not it's there's no there's no
[2:38:14] doubt there there should be no doubt and
[2:38:16] and one of the things that's changing it
[2:38:18] i don't i don't think it's as much the
[2:38:20] vaccinated people as as i do the natural
[2:38:23] immune people the people that have
[2:38:24] already been through it and now carry
[2:38:26] the antibodies against it i believe
[2:38:27] we're making a great difference
[2:38:29] i don't know what i don't know what
[2:38:30] vaccinated people are doing i don't know
[2:38:31] if they're making any difference at all
[2:38:33] that's that's not my my concern
[2:38:36] but i believe those who've had it and
[2:38:37] lived through it you're making a
[2:38:38] difference
[2:38:40] if you listen to everybody around you
[2:38:42] you huddle in fear
[2:38:44] you can't do that but you can't be
[2:38:45] stupid either
[2:38:48] you've got to use some wisdom
[2:38:50] you've got to be careful in this hour as
[2:38:52] much as possible because you may be fine
[2:38:57] but you don't want to be responsible in
[2:38:58] someone else not being fine
[2:39:01] god help us all
[2:39:04] we don't want to get caught up in all of
[2:39:05] that around us
[2:39:07] we want to know that there's somebody
[2:39:09] that we can go to
[2:39:11] you may maybe a week before you can be
[2:39:13] tested
[2:39:14] but you don't have to wait a week to go
[2:39:16] to the king
[2:39:18] lord i don't know what's going on in my
[2:39:19] body i don't know if this is a cold or
[2:39:21] sinus infection or flu or covet or i
[2:39:23] don't know what it is but i know you do
[2:39:25] and i know you're my healer
[2:39:28] i know that you are more than able how
[2:39:30] many of you like the idea that you can
[2:39:32] go to the king whenever you need to
[2:39:34] no other mediator between the king and
[2:39:36] us but that one man christ jesus so
[2:39:38] we're living in a kingdom and in and it
[2:39:40] is called in the chronology of the bible
[2:39:42] the messianic
[2:39:46] kingdom
[2:39:50] i don't know how many times i was going
[2:39:52] to present it but we'll do it another
[2:39:54] time i don't know how many times brother
[2:39:55] branham calls this
[2:39:57] the messianic kingdom
[2:40:00] he says the messianic kingdom has come
[2:40:04] this is where the bride is to be living
[2:40:07] in a kingdom that is not of this world
[2:40:11] the messianic kingdom
[2:40:15] he goes on in other words where the
[2:40:17] messiah rules
[2:40:19] in every life
[2:40:21] in his dominion
[2:40:23] ruling the lives of his people a called
[2:40:26] out people from every walk of life
[2:40:29] gathering them together in a group and
[2:40:31] calls it his church or his called out
[2:40:34] ones isn't that a beautiful
[2:40:37] thing
[2:40:39] and the congregation says amen
[2:40:41] paragraph 33 the same message now christ
[2:40:44] is the head of this
[2:40:47] christ is the head of this messianic
[2:40:50] kingdom and you cannot organize the
[2:40:52] kingdom
[2:40:53] of which christ is the head
[2:40:55] 33 of the same message
[2:40:58] you cannot denominate a kingdom
[2:41:01] which christ is the head
[2:41:03] because christ is king and you cannot
[2:41:06] take the intellectuals of a man and make
[2:41:08] an organization to which christ will
[2:41:10] govern
[2:41:12] therefore any companies any peoples any
[2:41:14] groups of men that tries to organize the
[2:41:17] kingdom of god they're going contrary to
[2:41:19] the king
[2:41:20] can you say amen to that
[2:41:22] and if they're going contrary to the
[2:41:24] king it would be against so it would be
[2:41:26] against the king
[2:41:28] so it's against the king it would be an
[2:41:31] antichrist
[2:41:34] he said that's pretty rough
[2:41:36] if i had just a little more voice we'd
[2:41:38] make that clearer
[2:41:39] it's an antichrist and if you'll bear
[2:41:41] with me a few moments i'll prove it an
[2:41:42] antichrist spirit tries to take a people
[2:41:45] and call them from organization to
[2:41:47] organization
[2:41:49] let's see if we can find this
[2:41:54] it uh in the list in the in the document
[2:41:58] it should be
[2:41:59] i could have left it off somehow
[2:42:02] but i pretty much drug it over so it
[2:42:04] should be right after the one we just
[2:42:05] read in 30. do you see it you do see it
[2:42:08] all right
[2:42:10] is it too much pressure if we wait on
[2:42:12] you
[2:42:14] are you all twins you always shake your
[2:42:16] head the same way and
[2:42:20] they both smile the same way shook their
[2:42:21] head the same way no i did not did the
[2:42:23] same way held their hand up the same way
[2:42:25] it's all right
[2:42:27] they're sweet help us this way
[2:42:35] you need to stand up and do jumping
[2:42:36] jacks real quick you can
[2:42:40] this one's not long
[2:42:55] i'll just read it from the start
[2:42:58] now christ is the head of this
[2:43:01] christ is the head of this messianic
[2:43:03] kingdom
[2:43:04] and you cannot organize the kingdom of
[2:43:06] which christ is the head you cannot
[2:43:08] denominate a kingdom which christ is the
[2:43:10] head because christ is king and you
[2:43:12] cannot take the intellectuals of a man
[2:43:14] and make an organization to which christ
[2:43:16] will govern
[2:43:17] powerful words
[2:43:19] therefore any companies any peoples any
[2:43:21] groups of men that tries to organize the
[2:43:23] kingdom of god is going contrary to the
[2:43:26] king and if they're going contrary to
[2:43:27] the king it would be against the king so
[2:43:30] if it's against the king it would be an
[2:43:31] antichrist
[2:43:33] it's heavy he's speaking about the
[2:43:35] denominational and religious
[2:43:36] organization to this earth he said
[2:43:38] that's pretty rough if i just had a
[2:43:40] little more voice would make that
[2:43:41] clearer it is an antichrist and if
[2:43:43] you'll bear with me a few moments i'll
[2:43:45] prove that an antichrist spirit tries to
[2:43:47] take a people and call them from
[2:43:49] organization to organization
[2:43:53] organizing them together which never was
[2:43:55] the will of god
[2:43:57] people has always fussed at me because i
[2:43:59] struck so hard at organizations it isn't
[2:44:01] the people in there
[2:44:03] that i'm striking at
[2:44:05] it's that dumb dominating spirit
[2:44:09] it's that dominating spirit that makes
[2:44:11] the people think that we
[2:44:13] are the people there may be a little bit
[2:44:15] of that around the message
[2:44:18] paragraph 34 god's people
[2:44:21] this is called out people
[2:44:23] i want you to listen carefully
[2:44:25] i believe they're in every denomination
[2:44:28] they could be catholic they could be
[2:44:30] protestant they could be jewish they
[2:44:31] could be any kind of a church but the
[2:44:33] real church is the mystical body of
[2:44:35] jesus christ now don't misunderstand and
[2:44:37] think
[2:44:38] that he is suggesting they stay in those
[2:44:40] places
[2:44:41] he's calling them called out
[2:44:44] if you're called out you're called to
[2:44:45] get out
[2:44:46] right
[2:44:48] uh come out
[2:44:50] of babylon
[2:44:52] all right
[2:44:53] but the real church is the mystical body
[2:44:56] that's it
[2:44:57] the mystical body of jesus christ
[2:45:01] let's stand together
[2:45:04] that's the church
[2:45:06] that we're called to
[2:45:09] it's not a church
[2:45:11] of the of this world or of man's making
[2:45:15] it's a church of god's election
[2:45:18] it is an unshakable
[2:45:21] unmovable
[2:45:23] kingdom
[2:45:24] no matter what happens
[2:45:27] politically
[2:45:30] in the in the arena of health and
[2:45:33] wellness and all that's going on and
[2:45:36] vaccines etc and all the things that are
[2:45:38] happening around us we're still part of
[2:45:40] another kingdom a kingdom that cannot be
[2:45:42] shaken a kingdom that cannot be moved
[2:45:44] now it's time that we live like that
[2:45:47] it's time that we manifest that
[2:45:49] and we can only do that when we choose
[2:45:51] not to be selfish
[2:45:53] but we choose to live for others and
[2:45:55] allow the holy spirit to operate in us
[2:45:58] for other people
[2:46:00] brother branham said the gift that he
[2:46:02] carried was not for himself
[2:46:05] we recognize that even in his death
[2:46:08] he unselfishly chose to do the will of
[2:46:10] the father
[2:46:12] in the vision experience that god gave
[2:46:14] me years ago where he took me to the
[2:46:16] bedroom of brother branham on the night
[2:46:19] before he left tucson
[2:46:21] and i saw the clock on the nightstand
[2:46:24] and i saw sister branham
[2:46:26] laying there under the cover i saw
[2:46:28] brother branham by the
[2:46:30] kneeling by the bed
[2:46:34] and i heard his prayer like the prayer
[2:46:36] of john the baptist
[2:46:39] he said oh lord
[2:46:42] let me live
[2:46:44] to see these things
[2:46:49] god was letting me know that it was the
[2:46:51] desire of brother branham to live to see
[2:46:54] everything that he had preached
[2:46:56] the full manifestation of the sons of
[2:46:58] god he wanted to be right in the middle
[2:47:01] of it not just a forerunner but he
[2:47:03] wanted to experience it and and see the
[2:47:06] fruit of what he had labored for
[2:47:08] he said oh lord if at all possible
[2:47:11] let me live to see this move of god
[2:47:16] nevertheless
[2:47:19] not my will lord
[2:47:21] but your will be done
[2:47:25] for i
[2:47:26] must decrease
[2:47:31] so that you
[2:47:33] might increase
[2:47:36] praying the prayers of those before him
[2:47:39] as much as he wanted to see it
[2:47:42] he humbled himself to the will of god
[2:47:47] because everything that we needed to get
[2:47:50] ready
[2:47:51] to step into it had been laid up for us
[2:47:55] and here we are today all these years
[2:47:57] later still trying to chew on that word
[2:48:00] so that it will produce in us
[2:48:03] everything that the kingdom of god has
[2:48:05] come to this earth for hallelujah
[2:48:08] and you'd think after all these years
[2:48:10] that we would have dealt with our
[2:48:12] selfishness
[2:48:13] and yet the spirit of god's calling to
[2:48:15] us this morning
[2:48:17] find that place in you
[2:48:20] find that place where you've preferred
[2:48:22] yourself over somebody else and ask god
[2:48:25] for grace
[2:48:26] ask him for grace
[2:48:29] ask him for grace to live a giving life
[2:48:32] a life for others
[2:48:36] lord we
[2:48:37] are so thankful today
[2:48:40] that you have translated us
[2:48:43] from the kingdom of darkness
[2:48:46] into the kingdom of your dear son the
[2:48:48] kingdom of light
[2:48:51] and lord we are so thankful today for
[2:48:54] the word of god that you have sent to us
[2:48:57] and preserved for us
[2:49:00] and we are daily being changed by that
[2:49:02] word hallelujah
[2:49:05] as brother greeley told us today nobody
[2:49:08] knows like i know
[2:49:12] you are working in our hearts
[2:49:13] individually
[2:49:16] putting your finger on things and we lay
[2:49:18] them on the altar
[2:49:20] you put your finger on something else
[2:49:22] and we lay it on the altar this is the
[2:49:24] life of a of a believer and though we've
[2:49:26] been filled with the holy ghost
[2:49:30] we still face the temptations of living
[2:49:32] in these bodies of flesh
[2:49:34] so i thank you lord for your great mercy
[2:49:37] your tender mercy your long-suffering
[2:49:39] toward us oh you're ready to forgive us
[2:49:43] you're ready to give us grace
[2:49:46] to get through the present circumstance
[2:49:48] or situation that we battle with lord
[2:49:51] these are your children here today
[2:49:53] and they're human beings we're we're
[2:49:56] just
[2:49:57] living in a body of flesh
[2:49:59] and it is our desire to be filled with
[2:50:01] the fullness of the holy ghost
[2:50:04] so that no matter what comes our way we
[2:50:06] can stand in truth
[2:50:08] and reflect the light
[2:50:11] so that you might have preeminence in us
[2:50:15] and that we might see the kingdom of god
[2:50:17] restored
[2:50:19] to its rightful position in this earth
[2:50:22] and all the subjects of this kingdom of
[2:50:25] god living in service to the king
[2:50:28] sold out surrendered
[2:50:32] with the holy ghost fired up
[2:50:35] generation of young people
[2:50:39] carrying us forward
[2:50:43] burning with a passion
[2:50:46] for personal relationship with you
[2:50:50] i pray over this body today lord
[2:50:53] that you would cause every one of us
[2:50:57] to have a zeal
[2:50:59] to work
[2:51:01] to labor
[2:51:03] to repent to pray
[2:51:05] for our relationship with you
[2:51:08] restore it and see it renewed and
[2:51:11] strengthened
[2:51:13] may we all god find grace to make it the
[2:51:16] most important relationship in our lives
[2:51:19] and spend more effort in building that
[2:51:21] one strong
[2:51:23] than we do in any of our other earthly
[2:51:25] relationships
[2:51:27] remind us of the importance of walking
[2:51:29] with you in spirit hallelujah thank you
[2:51:33] jesus
[2:51:36] bring us into that spirit to spirit
[2:51:38] worship
[2:51:39] where we worship you not out of our
[2:51:41] flesh
[2:51:43] we use our flesh as instruments of
[2:51:45] surrender but
[2:51:46] but we want a deeper place of worship
[2:51:50] we want our very spirits within us to
[2:51:52] cry out
[2:51:54] in service in submission
[2:51:57] in surrender
[2:51:59] to the holy spirit of god

[2:52:29] where you are that he might touch you
[2:52:31] it's your faith that does that
[2:52:34] it's not always the posture of your body
[2:52:36] but sometimes a surrendered posture is
[2:52:38] the best

[2:52:41] body it's your heart condition it's it's

[3:10:55] lord we love you
[3:10:57] we love you because you first loved us
[3:11:02] [Music]
[3:11:03] it seems that it would not be possible
[3:11:06] to love you
[3:11:08] had you not loved us first
[3:11:12] because we see so many around us
[3:11:15] who have no regard for your gift of
[3:11:18] sacrifice
[3:11:22] some who say i love him
[3:11:25] but they don't know who you are
[3:11:29] lord we can only love you today because
[3:11:32] you loved us first
[3:11:35] and we can only choose you today because
[3:11:38] when we came here we were chosen of the
[3:11:40] lord
[3:11:42] we don't say that lightly
[3:11:46] we know it was your
[3:11:48] divine wisdom and
[3:11:50] great foreknowledge
[3:11:53] our flesh is rotten
[3:11:56] when we get in your presence we can see
[3:11:58] just how rotten it is
[3:12:01] we need your grace to live out of the
[3:12:03] spirit
[3:12:05] and not out of the flesh
[3:12:08] we need help bringing the soul life
[3:12:11] into submission
[3:12:13] to what you are doing in our spirit
[3:12:17] so that we're not living
[3:12:20] the flesh nature
[3:12:23] thank you for calling us into a kingdom
[3:12:26] higher
[3:12:27] than the kingdom of man
[3:12:29] and the kingdom of this world thank you
[3:12:31] lord that what you have made us a part
[3:12:34] of is both unshakable and unmovable
[3:12:38] and even if everything around us should
[3:12:40] shake to its destruction
[3:12:43] we are citizens of a kingdom
[3:12:45] that can never be moved for that we are
[3:12:48] so thankful
[3:12:50] and so grateful today
[3:12:53] we ask that you help us lord as we go
[3:12:56] out of this place
[3:12:57] to be a light to those we come in
[3:13:00] contact with

[3:13:06] wonderful anointing will fall on brother

[3:13:19] faithfully served

[3:13:24] world

[3:13:36] for he and sister joyce their bodies to
[3:13:39] be strengthened and
[3:13:41] protected and kept
[3:13:43] as the burden of this body would fall on
[3:13:45] his shoulders
