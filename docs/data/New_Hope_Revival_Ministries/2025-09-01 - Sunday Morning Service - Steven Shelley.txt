Your dunamis, &gt;&gt; your dunamis power is inside of us. &gt;&gt; And it leads us to ask according to your will and not to consume it upon our own lusts. So Lord, we ask exceeding and abundantly above according to the spirit of the living God. Oh, I worship you, Jesus. Thank you. Thank you, Lord. [Music] Oh, where could I go? Where could I go? Seeking a refuge for my soul. [Music] Needing a friend to help me in the end. Where could I go but to the Lord? Oh, tell me, where could I go?

Seeking a refuge for my soul. Needing a friend to save me in the end. Where could I go but to the Lord? &gt;&gt; Amen. In him there is refuge. Hallelujah. We're going to go to prayer today and take our needs to the Lord. Do you have a need just by the lifting of the hand? All over the house, I see hands that are being lifted. God sees your needs out across that camera. Those of you that are watching this service, God sees your need and he knows all about you. And we join our faith with yours to remember your need to the Lord. Would we continue to remember brother Bobby words that God would give him a mighty miracle. He's having uh radiation and chemotherapy all at the same time. And it's a lot on his body. &gt;&gt; Yeah. he has uh already, you know, dealt with walking joint pain and and this is a lot. But the report that we're getting is that his spirits are high, his faith is high, and that sister Jennifer has been absolutely amazing in her faith &gt;&gt; and in her service to her husband. And let's just believe God. What a the brother Bobby is so known and and loved and cared for in the in the church communities and in the business world. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And uh what a great testimony to our God who is the same yesterday, today, and forever to give him a mighty miracle. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then the other request is there's a sister Linda Scaff. I don't know if you any of you really know her, but she has been at brother Bill uh Jon's church for many years now. And I think she's perhaps raising her grandson. You might would know her by seeing her with her grandson a lot. She had a spot appear in her eye that was bothering her. And she went to the doctor and found out that it was indeed cancer. &gt;&gt; And she is going through both chemo, I think, and radiation on the eye. It's taking quite a toll on her body. She's not u extremely healthy otherwise. And then you start putting this radiation right into the body and then all of the drugs uh hoping to be able to reduce the damage of that cancer. I don't know what the long-term hope is, but uh she reached out specifically and asked me to pray. Uh she loves us and uh and and really really needs our prayers today. God can move for her, too. It's no different whether it's your eye or or your brain or where where that devil is. We have a healing in the atonement. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; And we just have to keep speaking that and and let's let's do that. And I know there are needs here. Uh Tiffany needs prayer. She's indeed had a broke bone there, but it was already positioned to heal. But, uh, she's got to stay off of it and be careful with it. And, uh, Zach has a burn on his hand. And just so many needs, some of them huge and some of them small, but God sees them all. &gt;&gt; Sister Megan still in hospital. &gt;&gt; Sister Megan's still in the hospital. May come home today, she said. But she's just trying to trust the Lord and believe. And, uh, the boys have a a young man who does our lawn and and they know him for years. His mom and dad, they know them well. and and he had cellulitis in his face. He's been in the hospital for days and we're we're Joshua went to see him, but he's not been able to talk to him in two days. We're not sure if he's gone home or not, but it was getting very bad. They were going to have to do something. I don't know what all but it was it was pretty serious. His name is Try, and I'd like to see the Lord help him. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Amen. Let's take these needs to the Lord today. Sing this little chorus as we're getting ready to pray. Wonderful, wonderful Jesus. He is my friend, true to the end. He gave himself to redeem me. Jesus, [Music] wonderful Lord. Brother R.J., will you come and pray today, please? Oh wonderful, wonderful Jesus. He is my friend, true to the end. He gave himself to redeem me. Jesus, wonder. Sing one more time before we pray. Oh, wonderful, wonderful Jesus. He is my friend, true to the end. He gave himself to redeem me. &gt;&gt; Jesus, wonderful [Music] Lord. Oh, Aba, how thankful we are, Lord, to know that we're yours. &gt;&gt; To know that you called us, Lord. That you forneew us, that you called us, that you justified us, and that in you, oh God, we're already glorified. And Lord, we we come to you today to see the full outworking of your plan and your purposes. Lord, that nothing would be left behind, that nothing would be dismissed, but that there would be a people that would come forth and fully appropriate the redemption that you've provided, oh God. And so we come to you today, Lord, and we say that we believe. &gt;&gt; We believe your word, oh God. &gt;&gt; We believe that by your stripes, we are healed. &gt;&gt; We believe in the God that brings perfect peace to our lives. Lord, we're available to you. Oh yes. &gt;&gt; We're available for your purposes. &gt;&gt; We don't want to be observers, Lord, about what you're doing, but we want to be active participants &gt;&gt; as you outwork your will in the earth. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Lord, we lift every need to you today. &gt;&gt; Nothing is impossible for you, oh God. We pray for what's his brother Bobby. &gt;&gt; I don't know him, oh God, but you know him. &gt;&gt; I thought of that verse. It's our names are engraven on the palms of your hands. &gt;&gt; And even though it may may seem that you're far, oh God, you're so near. &gt;&gt; I pray that you would quicken my brother in the name of Yeshua, the Messiah. that faith would come and arise and that your healing anointing would flow, oh God, &gt;&gt; that testimonies of your mighty works would go forth for my sister. I pray Lord that you would drive this cancer out of her eye in the name of Yeshua, the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ. It's your blood, oh God, that heals, that redeems, that restores. &gt;&gt; We pray for those in our family, Lord, that are weward. &gt;&gt; Those that haven't yet realized who they are &gt;&gt; in you. &gt;&gt; We ask that your spirit would call them Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; and draw them, that their eyes would be opened, oh, Father, &gt;&gt; and use us. I pray for your people here, each of us, oh God, &gt;&gt; that our ears would be opened, that we would be sensitive to your voice, that we would be led by your spirit. &gt;&gt; Lord, help us not walk independently of you. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; But let us walk in full dependence, oh God. &gt;&gt; I think of that often. These needs, they come and they don't make us needy. We're not needy, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But we are dependent on you. &gt;&gt; And so we just posture ourselves, oh God, today. &gt;&gt; We do. &gt;&gt; For you're out working for your will to be accomplished, Lord. &gt;&gt; I thank you for this hour. I thank you for this season. I thank you for the destiny, Lord, that's that's being stirred and restirred and awakening among us. I pray for this young people, Lord, that that we would be able to see &gt;&gt; our position in you and that that that hunger that comes forth, Lord, help us, oh God, to sanctify it and not satisfy it on anything of this world, but let us satisfy it purely on you, oh God. &gt;&gt; Lord, all we can do today is just say that we're thankful. We're grateful for you. We're we're grateful to be called by you to be bearers of your name. &gt;&gt; Help us have ears to hear today. Lord, anoint my brother, Lord. Let there be no hindrance in the realm of the spirit, but let there just be clarity, Lord, and continuity in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord, that we can receive what we need to operate and function as your body and your bride in the earth. We say this in the name of Yeshua, the Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ. We pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. You may have your seats today. We are in one of God's cyclical seasons. the Jewish people leading up to the days of awe and the uh day of atonement. There's a period of time leading up to that they call days of repentance. We're in that season. It's a good thing to be repentant every day &gt;&gt; to make sure your heart is clear before the Lord and we're in anticipation of what the Lord wants to do for us during camp meeting. But we don't have to wait for camp meeting. We can be in anticipation today for him to do today. what he wants to do today and be a part of the building blocks of exactly what he wants to accomplish during camp meeting, which is another one of God's cyclical seasons, the feast of tabernacles. We just uh we just honor those because they're the feast of the Lord. And we are uh making preparations here on the Eagle's Refuge for the camp meeting. Uh you may have noticed as you come in today that the the the flower beds out here are taking shape. We're grateful to brother Daniel and all of his team that he had out here to get that on the move. Tomorrow morning we are going to have a work day getting the asphalt ready for coating recoding. Uh, brother Truman has graciously uh he has uh made available tomorrow morning breakfast for all of the brothers that show up for work. So breakfast is at 8:00 in the morning. Work will &gt;&gt; Well, if they want to operate a shovel, come on. &gt;&gt; I mean, there's still flower beds to get ready. There's uh and and uh there there's so much to do here on the ground now. I I need to make a an announcement and especially to all of you that live on this property. Everyone that lives on this property especially, &gt;&gt; not this week that's coming, but the following week, September the 10th, 11th, and 12th, we need to have as little traffic going in and out of this campground as possible. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. And depending on weather, possibly Saturday, but we're saying Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. I am asking you, I don't know how possible it is. They tell me that it's nearly impossible. And I'm asking you that you would get all of your Amazon packages delivered this week if you can because we are going to have to have traffic logistics as they try to get this property resealed. The asphalt that means one half of the road is going to be closed. there's only going to be one lane in and out and then the other day it's going to switch and go to the other side. And so we want as little traffic on it as possible while it is drying, curing, and so forth. And so we don't want the Amazon drivers. We don't want the FedEx drivers. We don't really want the post office. We're going to have to figure that out as well to be able to deal with the mail. Uh we may have to go pick that up at the post office. But I I'm I'm asking you humbly that you will help us in trying to navigate uh all of the traffic getting this uh asphalt recoded. So that is Wednesday the 10th through Friday the 12th next week. So we're asking for your help in getting this done. Brother RJ and Brother Hawk, there'll be one day where you all will have to park on the other side in the grass if you want your vehicles out because you won't be able to cross over when they seal the one side of it. Um, so that's that's important. I've already told Brother Shelley he can't come to work. Guess that's Benjamin, too. They're just we'll find a way. And so that's all part of getting ready for camp meeting. But we're excited because it is it is God updating. It is God doing. He's he's refreshing and renewing and and and he's getting us ready to go into the next season that he has for us. It's all a part of what he's doing in the spirit. We're doing everything that we can do in the natural because we want more than anything, we want the spirit to come down &gt;&gt; and do what he wants to do among us. Brother Ben and Sister Kendra have a song. We want to invite them to come. While they're getting uh in position, we want to receive the tithe and offering to give unto the Lord. What belongs to him and then what he has put in our heart to give as an offering. We want to give today. Brother Ellias, will you help us? And uh Brother Austin Yantis, will you will let you go to the people and let them give of their tithe and offering to the Lord. Give as giving to the Lord. Remember, when you give, you're not giving to man. You're not even giving to ministry. You are giving to the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's his business that we are pouring into. And and we want to see it prosper. We want to see him do what he said he would do. We want to keep covenant with him. [Music] of Jesus. [Music] Go plead with your mother were the words of Hosea as he sent his children to extend his mercy. So they journeyied down the old path that led to much destruction. And all the while their loving hearts were hurting. Their hope was crushed inside as their compassion was denied. The woman they so loved seemed like a strangeanger. Heartbroken and alone, they took the long road home. For sin now rain on a hope seemed gone to change her. [Music] One day the word was told some slaves were being sold. A restless love sent Jose Hosea seeking. One by one they brought them in. So beating down with sin within his chest his anxious heart was beating. All at once she caught his eyes. From his lips the bids were high. She could not believe the voice that she could hear when he through judgement take her life forever and his pain and strife. What would happen as she saw him drawing near her? I've come to take you home. I know that you've done wrong. [Music] But through you, I give my life. Through the sorrow, pain, and strife, I couldn't let you go. [Applause] Let's leave the past behind. &gt;&gt; Love conquers one more time. &gt;&gt; He took her hand and said, "There's a new day just ahead. I've come to take you home. Now I've stood in that same place, bound by sin, a broken slave. From the depths of my despair, I pray for mercy. I heard his word, the price was paid on the cross for you that day. Take my hand now, child, and welcome to the family. [Music] I've come to take you home. I know that you've done wrong, but for you I give my life. Through the sorrow, pain, and strife, I couldn't let you go. [Music] Let's leave the past behind. [Applause] [Music] Love conquers one more time. [Music] &gt;&gt; He took my hand and said, "There's a new day just ahead. I've come to take you home." [Music] Now I've stood in that same place, bound by sin, a broken slave. From the depths of my despair, I prayed for mercy. I heard those words, the price was paid on the cross for you that day. Take my hand now, child, and welcome to the family. [Music] I've come to take you home. I know that you've done wrong, [Music] &gt;&gt; but for you I gave my life through the sorrow, pain, and strife. I couldn't let you go. Hallelujah. And let's leave the past behind. [Music] Love conquers one more time. [Music] He took my hand and said, "There's a new day just ahead. I've come to take you home. [Music] I've come to take you home. I know that you've done wrong, &gt;&gt; but for you I give my life through the sorrow, pain, and strive. I couldn't let you go. Let's leave the past behind. [Applause] [Music] Love conquers one more time. [Applause] &gt;&gt; He took my hand and said, "There's a new day just ahead. I've come to take you home." [Music] He took my hand and said, "There's a new day just ahead. I've come to take you home." [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Beautiful job. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Ben and Kendra. Wonderful, wonderful job. Would you stand with us today as we're preparing our hearts even more for the word of the Lord that wants to come forth today, &gt;&gt; Jesus? &gt;&gt; Lord, we bless you. &gt;&gt; We bless you, Lord, for you are good. And we thank you for the plan of redemption. We thank you that you loved us, God. You loved us when even when we were in sin &gt;&gt; when we had failed you. But I thank you that you loved us. Thank you, Lord. He was on the cross. I was Thank you, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I'm not on an ego trip. I'm nothing on my own. I make mistakes. I often slip. I'm just common flesh and bone. But I'll prove someday just what I say. I'm of a special kind. When he was on the cross, I was on his mind. Oh, he knew me yet he loved me. [Music] He whose glory makes the heaven shine. so unworthy of such mercy. Yet when he was on the cross, I was on his mind. [Music] Yes, he knew me. Yet he loved me. [Music] He whose glory makes heaven shine. Go unworthy. &gt;&gt; So unworthy of &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. God bless you. Love you. &gt;&gt; Oh, when he was on the cross, [Music] &gt;&gt; I was on his mind. One more time. Yes, he knew me. Don't forget about what you're singing. Think of it. Yet he loved me. He whose glory whose glory &gt;&gt; the heaven shine. Yes, it does. So unworthy. Ah such mercy. Yet when he &gt;&gt; was on the cross, &gt;&gt; I was on his mind. Aren't you glad? If you're glad, give the Lord a praise. &gt;&gt; He wants to hear your voice. Lift up your voice to the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You may be seated. Even if it's not your comfort zone, it's a great opportunity when the when when the preacher or the worship leader or the service leader says, "Lift up." Oh, lift up your voice. What a great opportunity it is to stretch out of your comfort zone. &gt;&gt; And and uh if you're like me, you don't really like to hear your voice, especially if it's recorded. But uh he loves to hear it. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, even if you don't love to hear your voice, it'll be lost in the in the crowd to others, but he'll hear it. &gt;&gt; He will hear it. &gt;&gt; I've told you many times through the years about uh our wonderful experiences in Jerusalem. Um on Shabbat, the day before the Sabbath, everyone goes out. the the refrigerators are by design smaller like European size and so the people depend on fresh vegetables and fresh meat and sometimes never frozen and so they go out on Friday morning early and mom is home getting things ready and dad often it's dad that takes the children and uh if you know anything about the ultraorththodox Jewish community, you will know that they uh really take serious Jonathan the the quiver thing. They fill their quiver and then they start working on somebody else's quiver. And so there may be 8 10 children coming along behind there. And uh Israelis are abrupt uh somewhat rude by nature. It's a Middle Eastern sort of thing. And uh you will hear a million schle which means excuse me, but it's supposed to be a polite way of saying pardon me. But I want you to know if you've never heard an Israeli say it in a hurry. You need to hear it because it feels like you're being cussed out, not pardon me. It can be so aggressive and the little children get separated and and Brother West always hated when we told but it's the truth. He got a little separated from us one time and we had to find him. And in the midst of that crowd of pushing and shoving, dad's got a big bouquet of flowers for the Shabbat table and the little kids are hearing the sounds and they're just lost and may may not even know where they are. But all of a sudden in that loud hustle and bustle, there may be a merchant who's screaming out for his sale. All that going on at one time, and there'll be a little voice that says, "Aba, aba, aba." He's calling, "Daddy, daddy." And you would think that nobody would hear that in the crowd, but but daddy does &gt;&gt; because he he knows the voice of his little one. Any other day of the week, it might be mama. And the little child will say, "Emma, imma." And boy, she stops what she's doing right away, especially in troublesome times. And when is it not troublesome in Israel? And they stop what they're doing. and and uh even even rude, pushy Israelis know that that's an emergency moment and they just melt. They're just as polite and calm and to step out of the way so that that dad and and little one can be reunited. And and I I I thought this is the most wonderful thing I've ever seen in my life. Jesus said, "I am the good shepherd &gt;&gt; and the sheep know my voice &gt;&gt; and the stranger, a stranger they will not follow. They know the voice of the Lord." &gt;&gt; And that blesses me today. I'm blessed to be in his presence. When you create an atmosphere like you did during worship, it puts us all in a in a hard position to have to try to make an announcement like Brother Gley was making this morning. And I felt very sorry for for Ben and Kendra, but having to get up and sing after that because I knew there were quite a few people thinking, "Oh my goodness, my my who knows what. My vitamin L is coming next week and they get all in a panic and and you're probably not even hearing me now because you're worried about it." Uh, brother Greley doesn't know the half of it because he's not here during the week he's working. But, uh, if he were here, he would know that there are days when there are 12 packages sitting at the front door of the church. And we've told them uh, before maybe it's better that you just leave them here because if not, they go down, they get stuck, they it's it's just sort of a a mess. But we'll get through. Uh, pardon. Uh, I like those signs that say, "Pardon our progress." &gt;&gt; Brother Daniel sent me a text like that on Friday afternoon and he said, "I hope that our how did you say it? I hope that our progress will not disturb you." Um, he thought I may maybe he thought I would come out of here on Friday and I think, "Oh, half done. What a what what what a shame." But no, I came out and I said, "Oh my goodness, that is amazing." And uh but anyway, God's doing so many things. I couldn't tell them all, but he's worthy. &gt;&gt; He's here now. Even now, I was going to finish by saying that Ben and Kendra, uh regardless of the of the turmoil in the house, they sang. Ben's voice was as clear as I've ever heard it. It was nice because it was in a good key for him. Mark that key down. Uh Ben is like a lot of aspiring singers. They all want to sing high tenor like Ernie Hos. And some are given that gift and some are are given the gift of just a beautiful lead tone. And that's what he had today. Ben uh Bendra and Benra was given that beautiful little uh harmony part, little old low harmony and uh all it needed was my tenor and it would have been an amazing song. No, there was such an anointing &gt;&gt; and and it was so precious to hear him sing out. And I know that Sister Alita is sitting there thinking that's my boy. But I was sitting there thinking that's my boy. That's my girl. I felt that way today. I'm thankful for his grace. Marvelous, wonderful grace. And uh I'm not going to rush his presence. &gt;&gt; Boy, I got a shock when I came out here and saw that brother Gregory and his family was uh in a different spot. I did like that. I don't know if you saw me or not. Uh you know, it's a good thing to mix it up sometime. And you better be preparing yourself for it &gt;&gt; because we're believing that God's going to fill the house during camp meeting time. This has been one of the This has been an extremely busy week on multiple levels. And uh I I was going to thank brother Daniel, but I'm and the and I was going to say his wife, Sister Anna, and Brother Austin and Anna and Gile was here and I think maybe I was here and Gwen and I don't know how much digging Isaiah did, but uh they were all helping. I appreciate that. And then yesterday evening, what has gone on in the fellowship hall is an amazing thing. Uh people were getting some problems with their shoes and their clothes because there was a tremendous amount of dust under there that had collected in the even before the walls uh went up. You pour the concrete and all the dust comes blowing across there. You don't necessarily look at the floor and see red, but that's the color of what dirt was on there. It's that red dust and um it was it was becoming very difficult and uh charity got on it and they rented a a a machine that was no good much but you know God sent brother Truman and Brother Robert at just the right time. They weren't coming here for that. They didn't probably know what was going on maybe, but they figured out the machine the best they could. And uh folks got in and scrubbed and worked. And Stacy said when Josiah got in there, they were they were he was getting up more dirt. He was putting the elbow grease to it. And whatever you did and then and then Friday night, we interrupted the young people uh their little gathering uh toward the end and they emptied out the place had everything had to come out. And these are extra things that go on during the course of a week that don't make the app. They don't always make the website. But folks are busy getting ready because we feel like that doing physical things sometime is also a form of spiritual preparation. &gt;&gt; Do you need a biblical examples? Uh dig ditches &gt;&gt; cuz I'm going to fill them up. &gt;&gt; That was physical work to prepare for a spiritual release. Isn't that right? Go borrow vessels. Borrow not a few. &gt;&gt; Come on. Fill them up. Bring them in here. God's going to make a way. And so many times in scripture, we see uh physical things. Um you know, there nobody really enjoys digging the the roots of grass. Where we want grass to grow, it doesn't want to grow. It wants to grow in the flower beds. And when we tell you grass, we're not talking about the kind you just pluck up a few blades at a time. We're talking about the kind that has runners on it. And if you don't break them, they're they can be 12 feet long underground. And it's a lot of work. Nobody wants to do it. But there's something so spiritual about it because God loves gardens. &gt;&gt; And uh I was reading a prophetic word that came here during one of the camp meetings many years ago. I was reading it this week and and and God said, "If you will let me walk through your garden, &gt;&gt; I will let you walk with me through mine. Now, who wouldn't want to get in on that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; If you'll let me come in and and make some changes in your garden, &gt;&gt; I'll bring you to mine and let you walk with me. I tell you, it's powerful. I loved it. &gt;&gt; And sometime digging a root out and and and freshing a flower bed is a spiritual act. It's a physical act with hard work, but it has a spiritual implication. Uh if you pick up a piece of trash, that's a physical effort, but it's a spiritual. It it it speaks prophetically of preparing and cleaning and repentance and a time of of scouring out. Somebody said, "Aren't you getting a little carried away not even getting started &gt;&gt; because uh I believe we are a prophetic class of people." &gt;&gt; And uh I believed that before I read it in the church age book. So it has to be so. We're a prophetic class of people and uh that means that God deals with us in parabolic ways &gt;&gt; and it means that even our suffering can be a parable. We just covered that, didn't we? And so we should expect we should expect I'm trying now to get the message out of uh uh Zach burning his hand on the frying pan making breakfast. I'm trying to get the prophetic word in that. It hadn't hit me yet, but it'll come. Don't try don't go up to him and harass him. Uh but there is a me there's a message in many things that we look over. Uh God is here. &gt;&gt; This is an exciting time. &gt;&gt; You need to be here. &gt;&gt; You need to meet him every day. &gt;&gt; But two little times a week, just twice we we open the church for a service and be here if you possibly can. Um it means a lot to us. It means something to the Lord. Yes, &gt;&gt; it really does. &gt;&gt; The scripture tells us, brother Brandham tells us so many times that we should uh not forsake our our post of duty. &gt;&gt; And uh there's little Megan uh sister short person in the hospital today and she always sends a note when she's not going to be here. Always says um I'm not going to be at my post of duty today, but I'll be streaming. And I never expected to get one from her today. But the first text of the morning was from sister I won't be at my post of duty but I'll be praying and I'll be streaming. Um streaming is wonderful but it was never designed to take the place of fellowship and corporate anointing. &gt;&gt; And so we need to be mindful. I want you to be here every Sunday that you possibly can be between now and camp meeting if possible. And I want you to be preparing with prayer and as brother Gley said today, repentance and uh getting in proper alignment with whatever God wants to do for us. &gt;&gt; I have noticed through the years that one of the most important services of the year is the Sunday before camp meeting starts. I could give you examples, but it would take a lot of time. It's unfortunate that there's going to be a wedding in the Indiana community. And I know that some of you absolutely have to be there. But I'm going to ask the rest of you who do not absolutely have to be there to be here at your post of duty during such an important time. Whatever God does in that Sunday before, it sets a tone. I don't need amens. I love them, but I don't have to have them. I know I just let air out of the balloon. Kind of like an Amazon announcement, but I mean it. I'm asking you as a voice uh and maybe you'd at least pray into it. Uh you can send your regrets. You can uh give a bigger gift to the couple. They are fully aware that camp meeting is a very very important time for us and this may be one of the most important ones that we've ever had. There's an eclectic group of people from across the country who have uh let us know that they're going to be here and uh we've heard from today that sister Helga's coming from Iceland and and others and we we don't know where all they're coming from but we know that it is up to us to get things ready for them &gt;&gt; in the natural and in the spiritual. Now, if you want a church, Cascade Hills, I'm told, is a wonderful place for an hour service on Sunday. They have a fully staffed nursery and they have a playground and they have a coffee shop and I don't know what all else they have. And I hear that Highlands up here and community church in Opaikica. I hear that they have coolers that are stocked with soda pop for the kids. Who wouldn't want to go and have soda pop at church? Uh they've got all kinds of programs for all kinds of ages and uh they will treat you so many ways you'll you'll be bound to like one of them. Do you understand? &gt;&gt; But this is not just that. &gt;&gt; We're here by a commission, &gt;&gt; a divine commission. God sent us here &gt;&gt; and we're here for a reason and that reason supersedes &gt;&gt; it absolutely is higher than any other obligation that we have in this life. And if you want to know how Jesus felt about it, open the Gospels. &gt;&gt; He'll tell you. &gt;&gt; He said, "Let the dead bury the dead. You follow me." &gt;&gt; Interesting. Somebody said, "Well, I bought a piece of land. I need to go look at it." He said, ' Do you really? Who buys a piece of land and doesn't look at it? Follow me. &gt;&gt; Perhaps a tax collector said the I'm working for the Romans. They'll take my head off if I'm not where I'm supposed to be. Can't you trust me? Then come follow me. &gt;&gt; This is not Old Testament. That's gospel. That is the gospel. Now, uh I would only say something like that because of this hour and what we feel and see that the Lord is doing. And I loved it. The beautiful reel. Did uh Anna Christine do that? Is that Anna Christine wherever you are? That was absolutely outstanding yesterday. Beautiful reel that went out and I feel that way. You You're not going to want to miss. You're not going to want to miss what God's doing between now and then. That that preparation that's going on. And uh so I'm going to ask you to be as mindful as you possibly can, sensitive to the spirit. &gt;&gt; What if I were to go around the room and ask uh who prays about Now I know that there I I recognize that in here. I know for sure that there are some trips that are planned and I understand that and I'm not even addressing that. if you've already done your thing. I'm just talking about sometimes when there's a a wedding event or whatever that you know, everybody just wants to jump in and and and and make it a weekend away. Well, that would have been perfect the maybe even the weekend before. Might be all right the weekend after, but when we're getting ready to move where we believe God's trying to move us, uh we need everybody pulling. Now, if you're going to be here and pout, just go &gt;&gt; cuz we don't need pouters. &gt;&gt; We need somebody pulling. &gt;&gt; And you know what? I know that we're accustomed to pulling twice a week, but some of us have to pull every day. &gt;&gt; Every day we have to pull to create an atmosphere. This don't drop down on our heads like ripe cherries from a tree. And there's some of you that have some very sentimental planned trips and things uh uh maybe for a week. And I understand that. And I'm not I'm not uh hitting on that. Uh but I'm just saying that this is an important hour and we need to be uh present in in spirit, not only in physical body. &gt;&gt; I'm asking you that as your pastor. I know that people really would rather have um an old doting grandfather in the pull pit. I understand. But you didn't get that. &gt;&gt; I wasn't born to be that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Um, and so I'm just trying to do the best I can with what I have to offer. And I want to give him everything. &gt;&gt; Absolutely everything. &gt;&gt; And if that means I miss out on some fellowship, then so be it. If that means I have to miss out on some things, then I I'll just I'll just miss out. Uh because I really want to stay in the channel. My My first reaction when he says you you won't be able to access your office for three days is I'm thinking I'll have to get a mattress. because it's not just book work to me. Uh I'm here and I know you can meet him everywhere, but there's no place to meet him any better than where he said I'm going to meet you. &gt;&gt; That's a pretty that's a pretty important place for me to be. And uh uh oh, if you could see the things that walk by the window, I if you could if you could see the things sometime and feel and hear and sense what goes on on these grounds. And the Lord dealt with my heart over a year ago that he was going to sanctify and set apart this land again for his name. And I'm believing that this is the season. Let's stand and go to the word. Thank you, musicians. I thought at one time I might would have a song, but I think it's better to go on now. And uh I don't even think there's a song that could correct this what I've done. &gt;&gt; Now, if anybody could, y'all could turn in your Bible, if you will, uh to let's go to the New Testament here just a moment. Um, I probably will not be going exactly where I had hoped to go. It might even take me just a moment because I I grabbed some fresh notes here and I didn't really take time. We want to welcome everyone of the visitors uh that are streaming. Uh there are some I'm I'm not I shouldn't have said visitors, streamers, faithful faithful streamers. And I've been noticing and I didn't want to call this out, but I want to say to Sister Sarah in Indiana, uh from the bottom of my heart, everybody doesn't know you and know who you are. There's a few of us who do, but I want you to know how much it means to me when I see that you're watching. It touches my heart. In fact, I've sat down a couple times recently, prayed for you and and wept thinking about good old memories from way way back. And and I I don't like to, you know, if someone is just sort of wanting to be anonymous, well, I don't want to do anything to disturb that. But when she was bold enough to put her name and and her city, well, I wanted to tell you that we we really really love you and we really appreciate you watching this service today and and you're and you've been streaming faithful and it means so much to us. I haven't yet had a chance to speak to sister uh Isabelle about it, but I will. I want her to know that that you're joining us. Let's go to uh the book of uh I don't know where I'm going. Let's go to um uh where will we go? I'll get there in a minute. Luke 22. There we go. Praise the Lord. Luke 22 and verse 19. And he took bread and gave thanks and break it. And I know they didn't have time to find that. and gave unto them, saying, "This is my Are you with me? &gt;&gt; This is my body which is given for you. This do in remembrance of me." Was that his body? Not in the natural, but it represented his body. Now go to John 13 verse four and 5. And I'll read it quickly and you can rest your bones. He riseth from supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself. After that he pth water into a basin and began to wash his disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. Would you pray with me for just a moment? Father, how we thank you today that your word is not just a historical record or some sweet story. It is life to us. There are many, many layers and many applications to everything that we read. And you, my Lord, are our greatest example. May we find help today as we look to the Gospels. There are so many places that we can go in scripture, but there's something about red letters that thrills all of us because we know that to the best of the record, these are your words. To your disciples, to those who followed you in your earthly ministry, Lord, make us disciples in the hour where we are living now, in the century that we're now living in. May we be the talmadem of the Lord. May we be the disciples of the Lord. Uh many people would maybe prefer to be just a churchgoer. But Lord, there is a remnant of people around the world who want to be way more than just a churchgoer. We didn't come here today to see what the church could offer us. We came here today to see what you had. And we came here to bless you and to glorify your name and to worship you. Now, I know Lord that uh I have uh maybe said something that has stung somebody. May they find grace. I I truly believe that if they'd have been hearing you, I wouldn't have had to say it in the first place. But sometimes it is our responsibility and our pleasure to to share your heart with someone who may not be thinking in that moment in the same manner. I know that there are people who truly believe that these things matter nothing but watching the pattern of scripture. I know how important it is for me to be where I am to be in that right moment. I don't want to be three days late. I want to be right on time. And I believe there's a hungryhearted people uh who desire to be right in the center of your will. Now Lord, help me to preach above the emotions of the people and we'll give you glory, honor, and praise for it's in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." We're we would ask you to have your seat. You feel free to be seated. We're going to continue for just a little while on these prophetic acts of scripture. Uh really, I was preaching before I took a text. We're talking about the flower bed. We're talking about even the littlest thing that you do, you do it as unto the Lord. I don't know about you, but I tell him why I'm doing it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm doing this for you. I'm doing this for your glory. I I'm doing this that you would receive the honor. &gt;&gt; And it may be menial. It may be physical, but I'm doing it unto you, Lord. And when we can have that kind of a goal in mind, I want to do something that brings the Lord's pleasure and brings furtherance to his work. He sees it whether anybody else sees it or not. &gt;&gt; Do you believe he sees it? everything you've bought a and placed and put in place. Whether it was the handle of a toilet, whether it was a stopper on a sink, whether it was a piece on a a lawnmower, uh whatever you have done, a refrigerator appears, whatever you've done, and you just did it not caring whether anybody knew you did it or not. You didn't need a plaque with your name on it or a brick with your name engraved on it. you did it is unto the Lord. God sees it. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you, he sees it. &gt;&gt; And he knows. It's not wrong to turn in a receipt. By the way, if you do something like that and you bring us a receipt, we will write you a check. We we certainly will do that. But God sees what you do. uh uh brother man so many times has bought parts and and and and fixed things and and uh took no money or maybe even he did it a few times I didn't even know it was done so I couldn't offer him any money but we're doing what we do many times under the Lord and I don't ever want you to think that he doesn't see it he keeps a record if you believe that say amen and he knows and if you're never available to help why don't you free yourself up a little bit &gt;&gt; and help us Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody at the last minute on Friday said, "I've got to go to Lraange and pick up that machine. I'm got to get somebody to go with me and and pick it up." Well, that was unexpected. We didn't know it was going to turn out that way. It did. We got to learn to be fluid. And uh the Lord gave me a scripture, but I won't take time to share that with you right now, but I'll just paraphrase it. He talked about th those that are his and how they would be willing and how they would gladly volunteer &gt;&gt; in the in his day &gt;&gt; when God is doing something he would raise up his sons and they would willingly vol in the in the New American Standard says something like willingly volunteer uh to do to be a part uh not because they just want the reward but because they want the blessing of knowing I found something that I can do for the King of Kings &gt;&gt; and the Lord of Lords. Every floor you vacuumed, every baseboard you wiped, God sees it. &gt;&gt; These are acts of service unto the Lord. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus wasn't giving them his physical body. The the Catholic doctrine that teaches that the bread becomes the body and the wine or juice becomes the blood. It's error. And that's never what God intended and it's not what Jesus was even saying. A in fact it's kind of a dangerous thing to even participate in that kind of a communion because there are spirits attached to it. &gt;&gt; I told you many times that when brother Brandham was off the scene, the full gospel businessmen, they got loose. They were loose all along. Let's not be let's not be blind. They were loose all along. They were just an avenue that God was using to help the message get out. Uh but they were certainly not conservative in nature. Many of them cruel, very very crooked in fact. But God used it as a vehicle &gt;&gt; and lives were touched and changed because of it. As soon as brother Brandon was off the scene, they they wanted to make it more ecumenical and they wanted to bring the Catholic priest in to speak at the annual convention and they did one year and uh he was going to preach on how the church needed to be one and and they do. If the if the word is the is the post &gt;&gt; if the plum line of God's word has dropped, then there could be unity. But if error is being held, then you've got to be a little bit careful how you join yourself to idols. &gt;&gt; The scripture said you you don't want to join yourself to idols. &gt;&gt; You want to be careful about how you partake in things like that. And so they were going to have a interdenominational communion service. And uh oh, the Pentecostals, they were so happy about it. The charismatics, they were so happy about it. Everybody was so thrilled. And um but there was one person And guess what? He was Roman Catholic &gt;&gt; who stood up in that great big convention of the Full Gospel Businessman's Fellowship and he said, "Now, brethren, I love everybody here, but I need to let you know as a Roman Catholic, I believe that that bread and that wine is changed in the moment that it's blessed to the literal body of our Lord. And my faith forbids me to receive communion with anyone who does not hold that as their standard doctrine." And you know, the rest of those folks just dropped their mouth open. They couldn't believe what they saw was they were they were spineless. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They were s they were absolutely uh had nothing to say, speechless while somebody on the other end of the spectrum stood up and said, "I have convictions." Now, if you don't think that thing is moving even in faster and greater ways toward that one universal church &gt;&gt; like never before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in all of that ecumenical movement, there's a little bride off the off the beaten path, not in the spotlight yet who God is preparing her. She's placed in pockets all over the world. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. and uh he knows her name &gt;&gt; and he knows what's going on with her and he's working on her. She's his project. &gt;&gt; He loves her. That bridegroom king loves her above all the women. &gt;&gt; Oh, he loves her and he's getting her ready for her moment. &gt;&gt; She's going to get a moment. She's going to have a spotlight moment. It'll be a quick one. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry you're having a hard time getting with me. Come on. &gt;&gt; Uh, I don't regret a thing I've said. Let me just say it again. I don't regret anything that I've said. If you didn't want a pastor, I don't know why you're here. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Just be honest. Just be honest. You know, that's a wonderful thing. And we didn't wait till the church was paid off to say things like that. &gt;&gt; We've said that for years. We want everybody. I want all of you here. But I don't want you to be to be wounded and offended and carry that on in and hinder what God is doing. &gt;&gt; I want you to say, "Lord, help me and help my preacher because he's a man and he's likely to make mistakes." He just didn't make one this morning. &gt;&gt; But he's likely to make one before he's done. &gt;&gt; Uh this was not the real body, not the real blood. But Jesus is taking he's borrowing an element of the Passover order, the Passover seder. He's borrowing it for his purposes. And he's teaching them a lesson that will become an addition. It will become an addition to what God has already spoken through the elements of the unleavened bread and the wine. To us, it's not just a Passover. &gt;&gt; It's also a reminder. He said, "Best do &gt;&gt; in remembrance." &gt;&gt; It's in remembrance. It's a memorial. Do I have to tell you what God thinks about memorials? The Bible's full full of them, isn't it? &gt;&gt; He likes when we mark something that he's done. &gt;&gt; When we rejoice in what he's done and our faith reaches together for what he's going to do, he likes that. &gt;&gt; He delights in that. Are you here? &gt;&gt; So, this last supper was really a prophetic act. It was really a prophecy. He is prophesying that what you have been doing year after year after year following in the feast of the Lord, the feast of Yahweh. You have been doing this dress rehearsal. You've been you've been remembering the lamb that was slain and the blood that went on the doorpost. You've been remembering the bread of haste that you had to make and you weren't allowed to have time for it to to leaven to rise. You're you're you're remembering the bitter herbs. You're remembering all of these elements. And you've been doing it year after year after year. But I'm going to add a little something here that's going to give you a prophetic glimpse of what's about to happen in the earth. The spotless lamb is about to take his place. &gt;&gt; The one that Abraham saw when he lifted up his eyes and looked ahead. He's about to take his place. His body is about to be broken and twisted and hang before all of you. &gt;&gt; Come on. And his blood is going to be shed. It's not spelt. It was shed for mankind. &gt;&gt; And so when you eat this bread, you are partaking of the body of the Lord because that's who you are as well. He had a physical body. He has a spiritual mystical body. That's his bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand that? It's New Testament. Apostle Paul, first church age messenger, explained to us about the mystical body of the Lord Jesus Christ. He wanted them to know there's something about to shift here. And you're not going to stop remembering what I did in the Exodus. But now when you come together and you eat these things, you're going to remember my death. You're going to remember that a price has been paid for you. It was not based on your worthiness. Come on. &gt;&gt; It was based on fornowledge &gt;&gt; and predetermined destiny &gt;&gt; and it means something today. And he said it's going to mean something all the way in &gt;&gt; to the millennial kingdom. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What do you mean communion is going to mean something all the way into the millennial kingdom?" Well, Jesus told us that night. He said, "I'll drink no more of the fruit of the vine &gt;&gt; until I drink it with you &gt;&gt; in the kingdom." paraphrase in the kingdom. &gt;&gt; So, I tell you that's going to carry all the way through. I I believe he'll hand you a cup &gt;&gt; in the millennium. &gt;&gt; Uh I'm looking forward to that. &gt;&gt; That's eternity. &gt;&gt; We're getting closer than we've ever been before. &gt;&gt; Then he does something that's not a part of the seder at all. He There is a handwashing ritual that takes place. It It's to remind us you can't wash sin away. Just ask Pilate. &gt;&gt; You You can't wash away blood guiltiness with water and soap. &gt;&gt; But Jesus did a little bit different than what it had been done for a long time, maybe 4,000 years. Long time. Some people say two, some people say four, but anyway, a long time. And uh he did something a little different. He didn't just put the basin out for their hands to be washed and passed the basin. But the Bible said he took off his outer coat and he and he gerted himself around with a towel and he knelt down and he began to wash the disciples feet. Were their feet dirty? Probably. But they could have washed their own feet. He wasn't washing them out of necessity that day. He was washing them as a prophecy. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Well, the scripture tells us so. We just read in John 13 uh four and five. He began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel wherewith he was girded. The son of God word in flesh stripped his garment, girded himself, washed his disciples feet in in in view of all the other disciples. Humility was exposed. the servantthood nature of the new creation was exposed. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; John 13 uh let's look at verses 12 through 15. So after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again, he said unto them, "Know ye what I have done to you? Ye call me master." This is red letter. You call me master and &gt;&gt; help me. And you say, well, for so I am. If I then, your lord and master have washed your feet. Do you follow that? &gt;&gt; Ye also ought to wash one another's feet. &gt;&gt; For I have given you what? &gt;&gt; An example. an example that you should do as I have done to you. &gt;&gt; Well, the free will Baptists have been faithful about it. &gt;&gt; When the big Baptists, the big Methodists, the big churches all stopped having footwashing with their communion service, boy, the free will Baptist kept right on going. They saw it as a part of the same service. &gt;&gt; They preached very strongly. I went to school with a son of a free will Baptist pastor and and uh he pulled a class one day in a Bible study. How many of you go to churches where there's actual footwashing to follow communion service and there was only two of us in the room of about 50 people because most churches seem to think there's no reason for it. It's it's prophetic. It's symbolic. Uh but you know if we don't have to uh then to wash one another's feet as part of that communion service, there'd be no need to have a communion service anyway. Somebody said, "Well, we don't have a communion service." We will. I communed with him today &gt;&gt; and we all get to walk out of here &gt;&gt; on our feet. Not one Ananas, not one safara among us. Aren't you glad? &gt;&gt; But we commune with him. &gt;&gt; We commune with him. And there was no review of our record. &gt;&gt; There's a review of our record in communion. Paul said, "So, he said, "Many of the saints are no more." Paraphrase, &gt;&gt; some sleep, some are sick, some sleep. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Why?" Because they partok of this unworthily. &gt;&gt; Not that anybody could be worthy in themselves. The key is found in the next place. Not properly discerning. &gt;&gt; Not properly discerning what it's all about. You you you've got to understand that if there's a prophecy, there's a fulfillment and there's a message. If there's a sign, there's a voice. &gt;&gt; If God has us today following the example of the Lord Jesus, taking the little elements, washing one another's feet, it's saying something to us that must not be lost. &gt;&gt; Now, the reality needs to be this church. There ought not to be a brother, if I'm a brother, not ought not to be one brother in this church that I couldn't wash his feet. That's right. &gt;&gt; And be glad to do it. &gt;&gt; But he don't need his feet washed, particularly in the natural. I hope. &gt;&gt; I hope he's not saving it up. &gt;&gt; But by doing that, it's a demonstration, right? It's it's me reminding myself I'm no higher, no more important than any of the brothers around me. &gt;&gt; We've got to learn to serve one another in all manner always. &gt;&gt; Even when it's inconvenient, &gt;&gt; which would be quite often because we all have busy lives. &gt;&gt; Come on. That means wives ought to get out of the way and let husbands serve. &gt;&gt; And husbands ought to get out of the way and let wives serve. &gt;&gt; Well, who's going to get my dinner? Uh, you if that's what it has to be every now and again. Two pieces of loaf bread and a little mayonnaise and one of them some of that dyed yellow film they call cheese. You know the kind with the cellophane on it? It's not even cheese. Says right on it, cheese like food. Little mayonnaise. American they call it. That ought to clue you in right there. Good cheese doesn't come from America. Put a little mayonnaise on it. Put a little of that orange film stuff on it. Slap it together and do that. If your wife is is is serving the body &gt;&gt; every now and again now she has a duty. Why is it so quiet? &gt;&gt; Oh, I could tell you &gt;&gt; cuz the Holy Ghost hears you. &gt;&gt; You'll manage. My wife was over here last night serving. She said to me before I left 4:00, she said, "I can put your food together for leftovers from last night. I can put it together on a plate if you want me to, and all you have to do is heat it up." I said, "No, I can handle that. I I didn't feel like I was being mistreated because I had to make a little way for myself. &gt;&gt; Come on. I didn't eat as early as I probably should have because I was putting it off, you know? Well, I am I hungry? Should I really eat? Do I have to eat whatever? Probably everything will fit better tomorrow if I didn't eat, but you know how it goes. But it it blessed me to know that maybe she wasn't serving me at home, but she was doing something to serve the kingdom. &gt;&gt; You wives ought to feel the same way. If there's ever a chance that your husband can pull himself away from uh Frisbee, what do they call it? Disc golf or the other kind of golf. I believe Brother Brandon kind of calls it like golf or something because he talks about them knobbyby knees, you know, that you see out on those But if you if you enjoy it, then that's all right. That's up to you. No problem for me. But don't you dare, sister get upset. If he's doing something that would help the kingdom of God, we are called to be servants one to another. The Holy Ghost knows. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Some people just pull themselves back from the whole community of the church because they're afraid that if they make eye contact with anybody, somebody's going to ask them to do something. You tell people get as close as you can when you move, you know, get get over as close as you can. And you find people still, you know, 40 miles away, whatever they are, because somebody's afraid they're going to get called on. Oh my. When the squeeze moves among us, &gt;&gt; I don't like overnight company. I don't. I know you've got your judgments. I get it. I don't go to other people's homes unless I'm invited. I don't show up on their property unannounced. If they invite me, I may come if I can. If I if I can, I don't. And I don't let it uh grieve me to death. I don't live under that pressure. Somebody's going to have their feelings hurt. You You've got to live your life. &gt;&gt; I've got to live my life. &gt;&gt; I've got to be 100% when I get up here. &gt;&gt; And you understand that, I hope. But I enjoy it from time to time. I enjoy fellowship. I just like for people to go home when it's time to go home. I know how to turn the lights off and say hello, folks. &gt;&gt; Because there's something to be protected. Your body, your rest, your strength. &gt;&gt; We don't know what we're going to be called on to do tomorrow. &gt;&gt; So, we got to be ready. &gt;&gt; Do you follow what I'm saying? But when that squeeze comes down, you'll be surprised &gt;&gt; how we find ourselves doing those things that have made us so uncomfortable in the past &gt;&gt; simply because we're making do with what we have till rapture. We don't know how it'll look. We don't know if that'll be before or after the bride's revival. We don't really fully know the timing of all those things, but it would pay us to have a servant's heart &gt;&gt; toward one another. &gt;&gt; Jesus was getting at something. &gt;&gt; Do you follow that? &gt;&gt; I want to make sure you do. &gt;&gt; As your master, I've washed your feet. Ye also ought to wash one another's feet. For I've given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you. It means love and serve one another. Now look at Philippians 2:5 and8. Brother Greley preaches this uh verse very well. I remember hearing him preach it. Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself here's the part but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men. What a blessing. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. So the very fact that our Lord was willing &gt;&gt; to use these prophetic demonstrations. He was pointing to something greater than just washing feet &gt;&gt; and eating soda crackers and some juice. He was pointing to what the apostle would say so eloquently here in Philippians. It was part of this condescension. It was part of this submitting himself as a servant to the father's will and as a servant to us. I tell you, he comes when I call. &gt;&gt; How many of you have ever found out he comes &gt;&gt; when we call? &gt;&gt; He does. Now, I want you to go to Mark 11 with me just a moment. Well, praise God. Mark 11:es 12-4. I want you to know the spirit of God, he keeps a record. &gt;&gt; You better know it now. He keeps a record. And on the tomorrow when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry. And seeing a fig tree a far off having leaves, he came if happily he might find anything thereon. And when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves. This is a very important phrase. How about you all read the last phrase there for me? For the time of figs was not yet. &gt;&gt; For the time of figs was not yet. Let's go back over this again. And on the tomorrow when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry. This is in the last few days of our Lord's life. It's during the Passover of the year that our Lord was crucified. In just a few days, he will be gone from the earth. As he's moving from Bethany back into Jerusalem, he's hungry. He was still in a physical body and he saw there a fig tree a far off and he saw that it had leaves on it which was not uncommon in the time of Passover season for the early leaves to appear on the tree. Then it says but when he got there he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet. This seemed to disturb him. And Jesus answered and said unto it, "No man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever." And what does it say? &gt;&gt; His disciples heard it. This was not something so private that no one saw the record. &gt;&gt; Not one leaf curled up. Right? &gt;&gt; We don't have any biblical record that in that moment anything physically changed about that tree. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham tells us uh at least one time in the message that something happened in the roots. Right? &gt;&gt; I want you to know there are times that when the word of the Lord goes forth, &gt;&gt; you don't see any physical visible evidence that anything has happened. &gt;&gt; Get with me now. &gt;&gt; Somebody said all this uh refocus and shift and new excitement and I I don't even know what it's about. I'm not seeing anything any different than what I saw before. That's because you don't understand that the life of the tree is not up visible for everybody to see. The life of the tree is always behind the bark &gt;&gt; and underneath the ground in the leaves. &gt;&gt; Death set in &gt;&gt; down in those roots. Death set in. &gt;&gt; It moved in. And we know that because the scripture tells us so. It tells us what happened just a few days after that. I want you to look at Matthew 21 for just a moment. I I I wish you could squeeze this and try to get something out of it. &gt;&gt; Now in the morning, Matthew 21 18-22. Now in the morning, he returned into the city. He hungered. This is another telling. And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it and found nothing there on but leaves only, and said unto it, let no fruit grow on thee henceforward forever. And presently the fig tree withered away. Now that word pres uh that word presently is to be honest with you, it's similar to the concept of suddenly. It means that something happened. It may not have been something that you could immediately physically see or the other gospel would have most likely recorded the same, but something responded. &gt;&gt; I hope you hear that something responded &gt;&gt; to the word of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And thereafter, I don't know how long it took, but death just starts spreading up. You cut off the life and death starts spreading up. &gt;&gt; One night, last Monday night, uh had some limbs cut unexpectedly, bunch of limbs cut in the front and uh sick and tired of the squirrels and all the damage they do to the vehicles. And so we the bunch of limbs were cut and they lay there. The first first day they lay there, second day they lay there, they looked just like uh why you could have stuck them in the dirt and they would have they would have continued to thrive. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know it didn't take too long before they recognized there was no longer any life flowing through there. &gt;&gt; And now you ought to see them. They've withered away. &gt;&gt; And that's what happened. Now, now was it fair? I want you to help me understand. Was it fair that Jesus cursed a fig tree out of season? &gt;&gt; I don't know, but I got a feeling that this was prophetic. &gt;&gt; I don't know, but I got a feeling that there were layers and levels of messages that were being spoken &gt;&gt; in front of those disciples that day. &gt;&gt; This wasn't out of frustration. It wasn't out of real physical hunger. It was a prophetic sign act like those of the Old Testament prophets that we mentioned Tuesday night. Jesus did it in public right there with the disciples and an earshot of anybody else traveling into the city of Jerusalem. It was judgment in action. The tree looked fruitful. It had leaves on it, but it was barren. Jesus was exposing the hypocrisy of religion. Somebody said, "How in the world is that possible?" He said, "No man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever." It's like being in the vessel of public gaze. &gt;&gt; The suffering, the trial, the squeeze, the problem. It's just right out there in the open for everybody to see. There must be a deeper message here. In Jewish thought, the fig tree represents often national Israel. Did you know that &gt;&gt; it represents the nation's spiritual condition, especially in the Old Testament? I want you to look at Hosea 9 and verse 10. I wished, oh, how I wished that you could hear what the Lord would desire to say to you this morning. &gt;&gt; I I'm finding myself growing a little agitated, and I don't want to do that. I want you to hear what the Lord desires to say to you. &gt;&gt; And if it will make you get in this service, just go. &gt;&gt; You hear me? Just go. Just go. Do exactly what you want to do, but don't complain. &gt;&gt; Please, please don't complain. And don't ask for prayer when that thing that God has promised filters down &gt;&gt; because you forfeited it with your stubborn will. &gt;&gt; This is a prophetic hour. &gt;&gt; Saints will miss it. They will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There'll be those who sit here this morning and say, "Oh, I'm so I can't believe that people are going to hear this on the internet. I can't believe that people are going to hear this on Facebook." Folks, it doesn't really matter &gt;&gt; in the end. We'd better be able to discern the man's voice &gt;&gt; cuz this is a man standing here and what the Lord might be trying to say to us. &gt;&gt; You see, fig trees have a very important symbolism to the nation of Israel. And Hosea 9:10 said, "I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness." That's wild grapes. I saw your fathers. Look at this word. I saw your fathers as the first ripe. First ripe, one word, first ripe in the fig tree at her time. But they went to the elor and separated themselves under that shame. and their abominations were according the bridegroom is saying through the prophet Hosea by the way of of which we heard the song this morning. The bridegroom is saying, "I looked at Israel like the wild grapes that someone finds wandering around in the wilderness without a granola bar. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Without beef jerky, without heart attack, &gt;&gt; when the when the wanderer is so exhausted &gt;&gt; and physically drained, what a delight it is out in the in the wilderness. to be able to look over and see a little patch of wild grapes &gt;&gt; full of natural sugar &gt;&gt; and so sweet and you run over there, stagger over there and you start eating them as fast as you can. The bridegroom is saying, "I loved Israel &gt;&gt; the way that a wanderer would love the the sustenance that he found in the middle of the wilderness. in the in the provision of the wild grape. And then he said, "And I saw your fathers. I loved the generation before you as the first ripe in the fig tree at her first time." Do you notice how that's being worded? as the first ripe in the fig tree at her first time. We'll get to that in a moment. Hosea is speaking on behalf of God. And God Yahweh is saying, "I long for Israel as one longs for those first sweetest figs. They are sweeter than the rest. &gt;&gt; The first ones are the best of the best. And this is how I long to have relationship with Israel. In Jeremiah 8:13, I will surely consume them, sayaeth the Lord. There shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade, and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them. Again, it's a lover. It's a bridegroom king who is saying, "I have showered Israel with provision. &gt;&gt; I have made the sacrifice for those that are mine. My patience is done. &gt;&gt; I'm going to take what I have given them and feed it to others. &gt;&gt; I'm going to find Listen, if you go on, if you go on through the prophets of the Old Testament, I'm going to go on and find a people for my name. &gt;&gt; The New Testament goes on to say, a people who are not a people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A people who are not a people. a people who had no right to the natural inheritance of spiritual Israel. But I'm going to find them among the nations. I'm going to find Gentiles who will trust in me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to give my grapes and my figs to those who will love me back. &gt;&gt; Pretty serious. &gt;&gt; The point of those verses was to show you that God uses the fig. He uses the grape as a type of the spiritual life of the nation of Israel. &gt;&gt; Jesus knew what he was doing &gt;&gt; when he cursed the fig tree. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; Jesus was enacting judgment on Israel's religious system. They were outwardly alive, full of pomp &gt;&gt; and circumstance, &gt;&gt; icons blaring. &gt;&gt; You understand? Got his picture on the wall. Got the cloud on my lapel. Got the belt buckle on. I'm one of them. Got the right bumper sticker. Jesus was exposing the religious system of the second temple period by saying, "You look all right on the outside. You look lively. You look like you're thriving. Your leaves are unfurling and unfolding, but there's something that is very wrong. You are inwardly barren, and this is the season that Messiah is coming to you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You say all of these years you've longed for Messiah &gt;&gt; and you've missed, remember the prophet, he said in the Old Testament, you've missed your day of visitation. You say, "We believe Messiah's coming. We believe Messiah's coming. We believe Messiah's coming." But you made no spiritual preparation &gt;&gt; for the coming of Messiah. &gt;&gt; And so when he comes, you don't even know who he is. &gt;&gt; Have I been with you so long and you don't even know that I am? &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he said? &gt;&gt; That's what he said. &gt;&gt; You're looking for the father. Here he is. &gt;&gt; He said it. Here he is. &gt;&gt; And you didn't even know he was among you. Right? &gt;&gt; Because you've forgotten what the father is, who the father is, &gt;&gt; what his desires are. &gt;&gt; You've hoarded. You've chased after other things. &gt;&gt; As the prayer went forth today, you you you have found other things to to to sort of saturate the hunger. &gt;&gt; But I'm telling you, I it's like sugar. It's so good in the moment. It's so wonderful in the beginning, but it doesn't stay with you very long. &gt;&gt; It spikes you. And if you're not careful, you'll find yourself empty and hungry. &gt;&gt; Hungry. &gt;&gt; You want to stir up your appetite, eat more fruit. &gt;&gt; Everybody will tell you. Anybody will tell you you you want to eat more other things, eat more fruit then because even the natural sugar in the fruit stirs the appetite of the body, &gt;&gt; sends you into a fast. I mean, I enjoy it, but it sends you into a fast high and then a long crash. It doesn't give you what you need in the long term. Some of these entertaining things that we uh that we run after, they give us some momentary pleasure, &gt;&gt; but it doesn't satisfy &gt;&gt; in the long term. &gt;&gt; If you could have seen in the night, what I saw in the night last night, those things that are creeping in in the door, those things that are climbing in through windows and uh even sliding under doors. And I'm asking the Lord, how is it possible that these things could invade the private homes of the saints of God? How is it that the enemy I want you to know something. I'm pretty particular on this. I believe that the enemy is a trespassor on my little two acres. &gt;&gt; If he shows up, he has no business being there. &gt;&gt; It doesn't belong to him. &gt;&gt; I take very seriously what is mine. Amen. I claim it. I pray over it. I sanctify it. I do everything I can to make sure that the devil doesn't have an easy pass &gt;&gt; into my place and out of my place because I need to have an atmosphere and you do too to be able to worship the Lord and bring the presence of God. I don't need horrible dreams. &gt;&gt; I don't need filthy dreams. I don't need tormenting dreams. So I do everything that I can to sanctify my home, my property, my my my place. &gt;&gt; You should too. &gt;&gt; The answer came and I saw it even in the spirit. I saw how that these things had been invited in like an easy pass. Did you know that sometime you're on a toll road and you come to a a a toll booth and in the old days you had to come to a complete stop and you had to dig for change. That's why a lot of our vehicles have these little coin slots around. So you keep your coins handy and you drive down, you slow down. Sometime a complete stop you had to come and you throw the coin in and the coin registers and the arm goes up. But somebody in their amazing uh ingenuity uh came up with an easy pass. &gt;&gt; And uh for a while you just flashed that thing. You just flash it up. You still had to slow down. Still had to come almost to a complete stop. And sometimes in traffic you did come to a complete stop. You just Well, first I think you had to swipe them. Then the technology went a little higher and you just splashed them. Beep. arm goes up, you go right through. Not anymore. There are places in this nation where you get an easy pass. You can install something right up on the front of your vehicle, right up on the In fact, some uh new vehicles come with the computerized ability to to to program your number in your vehicle and it will flash it up. But you put a little something up there in the top and there is a a reader and as you get in that lane that your number, your easy pass, you pay for it monthly or yearly and and it registers that you are a paid subscriber and you don't even have to slow down, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You've just got an easy pass. Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; I saw that some of us had subscribed. Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; We had given the enemy an easy pass. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. &gt;&gt; I saw it in the toys. &gt;&gt; I saw it in the movies. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I saw it in characters and heroes and she &gt;&gt; and when that enemy wants to harass and hinder, he don't even have to flash a badge. He doesn't even have to explain why he wants to be a squatter &gt;&gt; or why he wants to be a trespasser &gt;&gt; on our land, &gt;&gt; on our stuff, &gt;&gt; in our home. &gt;&gt; Friday night, that was last night. Friday night he dealt with me through the night about spiritual priesthood, the priesthood of the believer and the responsibility of the believer to function in in a in a holy manner as a priest &gt;&gt; particularly the men. Now the priesthood of the believer is a genderless scriptural concept. &gt;&gt; But the priesthood of the home &gt;&gt; in a marriage, it belongs always to the husband. &gt;&gt; He becomes the spiritual priest of the home. It's not enough for him to pray. &gt;&gt; He's got to teach his family &gt;&gt; how to pray. &gt;&gt; He's the gatekeeper of the house. I things I know he taught me again, showed me again. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And if he's not doing his job, I think that's kind of what led to the experience last night. It's just an easy pass. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; And sometime mama can pray and sometime mama can cast out devils and sometimes mama can get the broom like the Kendrick brothers movie. &gt;&gt; But I want you to know if daddy has installed an easy pass. &gt;&gt; Now I'm really going to preach. I gave you an opportunity to jump in on the gospel. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm really going to tell you what I saw. &gt;&gt; If daddy has installed an easy pass, then the enemy comes and goes. And it hardly matters to him. The carrying on. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You see, tongues is not what moves the enemy. It's authority. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And if you don't have any authority in your tongues, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Hello. If there's not a life behind it, &gt;&gt; then it's jibberjabber in the pr to the prince of darkness. &gt;&gt; And he just says, I don't care about your mumbo jumbo. The doors wide open spiritually and I'm going to come in and I'm going to pitch my tent. &gt;&gt; I saw the spectrum. &gt;&gt; I prayed against it this morning standing on the platform. I prayed for neurological healing &gt;&gt; in the brains of the saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Craziness, isn't it? Almost. You hear this talk, it's almost sounds like crazy talk, &gt;&gt; but we're living in such an hour where there's more mental illness &gt;&gt; around us than wellness. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And some of it is simply because of our choices. what we choose to believe, what we choose to embrace, what we choose to entertain, what we choose to meditate on, it wires. &gt;&gt; It keeps us in that place. &gt;&gt; And that's why as you look around, you recognize that just about everybody around you in your life is on the spectrum somewhere. It seems that almost everybody's got a little autism or a little bit of ADHD or a little bit of so and so. And they may laugh at Robert Kennedy and they may make fun and they may think he's just a big dummy. You may be one of them. But I want you to know he's a lot of things, but he's not a dummy. He understands simply understands what big pharma refuses to understand &gt;&gt; and that is drugs are not always the answer. &gt;&gt; Reconditioning and changing your behavior and rewiring the synapsis of your brain and making up your mind that you're going to be what God called you to be. Believe what God's word said you are. You're going to raise up a holy standard in your own life, &gt;&gt; your family, &gt;&gt; not someone else's, &gt;&gt; yours. &gt;&gt; You're going to be a spiritual priest, Dad, to your home. You're going to I tell you what, if I were you, I'd go home today and revoke the devil's easy path. &gt;&gt; Some of you ought to start in a toy box. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You ought to go through some of those hideous things you've bought for your children &gt;&gt; because you didn't want them to be left out from the other church kids who were allowed to play with that that kind of stuff. &gt;&gt; Let's see how tough it gets now. &gt;&gt; The things we set our kids down in front of that what rewire them, rewire their brains. Let me tell you something. It's not normal. I don't care who says it is. It's not normal for little children to go around telling people, "I'm gonna kill you." &gt;&gt; No, they didn't get that from the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; That's not normal. &gt;&gt; You need to understand that's not normal. &gt;&gt; Something is out of line. &gt;&gt; The enemy has been given an easy pass. Somebody better recognize it and do something about it while you can &gt;&gt; because these are the kinds of things that will keep us from standing in the line to receive what God has put our name on. &gt;&gt; If my name is on it, I want it. If it's promised to the end time believer, I want it. &gt;&gt; You don't understand. You don't understand the times we're living in, Brother Shelley. You don't understand what teenagers go through today. You don't understand this, that, or the other. I tell you what I do understand. &gt;&gt; I do understand that the world is putting its stamp &gt;&gt; on the brains, on the minds of children. And what goes on out there, we have nothing that we can say about it that will effectively make a difference. But what goes on in here, it's somebody's responsibility to cry out against it. &gt;&gt; If it hair liips the devil, &gt;&gt; we better be careful what we're putting in front of their eyes. &gt;&gt; Violence and all of the things that people are so crazy about in this hour. It's absolutely rewiring the circuits of our brains, causing us to process things differently. And that's why you have scrolled all week. Some of you women have scrolled all week with your thumb, men too. &gt;&gt; And that's why you can come in here on a Sunday morning so easily and use your thumb &gt;&gt; to scroll past the part that you don't like what the preacher says because you've absolutely put yourself in that kind of a frame of mind with your thumb. &gt;&gt; You want me to tell you what Jesus said? He said it would be better to have your eye plucked out. &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to just make this up to the 2025. Might be better for you not to have a thumb. &gt;&gt; Now, please understand that I don't mean that in the natural and in the physical. &gt;&gt; What I mean by that is a people who call themselves the bride of Christ filled with the Holy Ghost, sanctified by the washing of the water of the word, ought to have enough control &gt;&gt; to be able to use that thumb &gt;&gt; for something other than filling our minds with the garbage. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That will keep us from our spiritual destiny. &gt;&gt; Who are you preaching to? You. &gt;&gt; Nobody but you. &gt;&gt; Pretend you're the only one here. &gt;&gt; And that's who I'm preaching to. Amen. &gt;&gt; You, you, you, you, you. So, somebody goes out, I think he was talking about me. He was. &gt;&gt; And the one next to you, and the one next to you, and the one next to you. &gt;&gt; Because the word of the Lord is to all of us. &gt;&gt; Who do you think is going to make a difference for your home if you don't make the difference? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, I my teenagers, my my my 10, 11, 12, you know, because that's how we look at 10 year olds, 11 year olds, and 12 year olds. They're not teenagers. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; There's a huge difference between a 10-year-old and a 13-year-old. &gt;&gt; In fact, there's a period of time in there where the difference of all your lifetime from from the baby all the way to the death. There's a period of time in there where where a one year can make the biggest difference &gt;&gt; in someone's ability to process life. &gt;&gt; That's why we better be trying to deal with them in the present and preparing them for the next. That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's why wise people, wise parents sometime are careful about uh you know age groups and things like that. &gt;&gt; Because kids are just like parents. They talk. &gt;&gt; Imagine that. And they talk about whatever interests them and they talk about whatever they're going through at the moment and whatever they're dealing with and whatever they're facing. And there are times that things like that happen and there's uh some in the crowd that are processing life differently because they're not in the same age group and they've not been raised in the same spiritual environment &gt;&gt; and they're not quite ready to process &gt;&gt; what they hear. And if we were raising wise children and wise teenagers, and I pray we are, then surely they ought to be able to look around. But here's the thing, they lose themselves when they find an ear &gt;&gt; and they just of course because they feel like they're not heard &gt;&gt; and so they just want to say it. And sometime they don't process the fact that there's an ear there that might not have the ability to to fully grasp or process the depth and the adult nature, &gt;&gt; the mature nature of what you're saying. I want you to know something. We've got to be very, very wise in the hour that we're living in right now. I agree with you that children are are hearing and they are exposed to things at a much early age. But I don't agree with you if you say that that necessarily prepares them mentally to be able to process it. &gt;&gt; Just think about all the things that you didn't know till you were fully grown. &gt;&gt; Think about the things you didn't know about marriage till you were married. &gt;&gt; And you'll understand. I I can assure you that in my my younger day, uh, men didn't know when when somebody else's wife, &gt;&gt; you get it. You sure? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. It just You just didn't talk about it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah, &gt;&gt; I don't know whether it should be or shouldn't be, but I'll tell you sometimes it makes me extremely nervous when I see little ears and I'm thinking somebody's going to have to do some explaining. Hallelujah. It won't be me. &gt;&gt; Come on. We've got to use wisdom. I'm telling you, somebody better get that easy pass out of the hand of the devil. I'm going to I'm going to close in a minute. I am. I'm just going to leave it like this. We better make up our mind. Listen, why don't you just become a little Holy Ghost fililled warrior, man or woman? Why don't you just anoint your house? [Music] &gt;&gt; Why don't you just anoint your house? Why don't you just go through things? You'd be surprised what we bring in. &gt;&gt; What we let in &gt;&gt; the enemy? Somebody said, "Well, you don't you're not saying that objects are cursed." Well, I don't have to say that. The Bible said so. &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody said, "You're not saying that there are evil spirits that attach themselves to things like that." Oh, yes, I am saying that. I don't care if I make the podcast. Uh uh I am saying that. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; They're looking for a way in. You &gt;&gt; remember the experience that I had many years ago uh with a cocking gun. What it looked like was a cocking gun. But my cocking wasn't white and it wasn't cocking. &gt;&gt; It was blood. Somebody said, "You'll never see blood in a spiritual experience. You may never see them in yours, but I've seen them several times in mine." &gt;&gt; This was the blood of Jesus. &gt;&gt; And the blood of Jesus, the the hoots and the hows, let's say it that way, the hoots and the hows of this old world, &gt;&gt; uh, the the wolves, &gt;&gt; they run in packs of three &gt;&gt; and they'll harass you spiritually &gt;&gt; and they'll look in at the window. And in this particular experience, they're looking in the window. And I knew nothing would satisfy their hunger, but my flesh. Here come the gun. And I'm just cocking the window. And this isn't cocking. This was the blood of Jesus. Sister Shosana sings it sometime. Devil, Satan, you can't cross the bloodline. He can if you give him an easy pass. &gt;&gt; He can if you bring the Halloween costumes in and &gt;&gt; all the things that people get into these days. &gt;&gt; He can then you give him an easy pass. Hear me. &gt;&gt; Hear me. Some of you wouldn't want me to see. You wouldn't want anybody that you respect in this house to see some of the things that you have purchased for your children to play with. The things that I wrestle with in the night on occasion are the things that Hollywood so quickly picks up on and they do everything they can to sell them so that they become common. The whole the whole Harry Potter thing was absolutely I don't care. I don't care if she was a a starving woman who had didn't even have a cup of tea. That doesn't mean that God inspired &gt;&gt; to make her the millionaire billionaire she is. &gt;&gt; May God help her. I've actually prayed for her by name and asked the Lord to help her because what she's done with her books and movies that were made after has so desensitized people &gt;&gt; to that realm of of spiritual wickedness of witchcraft and sorcery etc. until I know Christians and I want you to see these big old air quotation marks because that's exactly how I feel. And I won't even say believers &gt;&gt; because I know believers aren't interested in that kind of stuff &gt;&gt; because they understand that if Hollywood is pumping it, &gt;&gt; come on. If Hollywood is pushing it, &gt;&gt; it's likely to be something to pull the wool over &gt;&gt; on the church's eyes. Boy, do I sound a bit like a fanatic. That's because we don't hear enough of it. &gt;&gt; And then when we pull it out and hit it with both barrels, it makes us all feel a little fanatical. But it's absolutely the truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you're going to tell them about another realm, tell them about the spirit realm. &gt;&gt; And tell them about angels. &gt;&gt; And tell them about how God assigns angels to deal with things that come against us. &gt;&gt; We go into restaurants, we fight them. We go into Walmart, we fight them. Drive down the road. Driving down the road &gt;&gt; in my own vehicle, &gt;&gt; bothering nobody and following the law, you'll see people go by. You're going the speed limit. you're not doing anything to cause anybody any harm. And you'll see people going down the the road, fingering you and mumbling something and mad at you and throwing their hands up in the air and you're trying to figure out. Now, I know good and well, boy, I try to be pretty courteous in my driving because I know people aren't looking. And so, I know I haven't done anything. I'm trying to figure out what in the world what in the world is wrong with these people. and you've been in similar situations. And it's not anything you've done at all. It's the difference that your life makes. &gt;&gt; It's worth guarding. &gt;&gt; It's worth watching. Let me let me just finish a moment of this and we'll go. We can go. Jesus was exposing the hypocrisy that was taking place in the religious world. these fig trees in Israel. And I want you to hear this now because it wouldn't have been fair. I agree. It wouldn't have been fair for Jesus to rebuke a fig tree for not having figs in a season where there were no figs. But something caused him to expect figs. This wasn't just a random thing. Something caused him to expect by what he saw with his eye. The thriving life of the tree leaves in place that he would find a fig and he found none and he cursed it. I'm I I want to know, don't you? Inquiring mind, somebody wants to know why he would have expected. Well, there's a there's a real explanation for that. Uh would you show us the definition there in the Hebrew of the word that we used in Hosea, first ripe? Now I asked charity to divide it first ripe because in King James it's combined and it looks like such an odd word. When I looked at it I thought I don't think that's a word I've ever paid much attention to as one word first ripe. So I divided it just for the sake of you being able to understand it. It means exactly. You didn't need the Hebrew. It means exactly what it sounds like. It means first ripe. It sounds like first fruits, doesn't it? The word is uh often transliterated, which is an English spelling of a Hebrew or Greek word. It is transliterated as becka or beura. And it's from the root bakar which means to be early first born earliest early fig first ripe fig. Listen to this. It refers to those first figs of the season that ripen before the main harvest. They are especially valued because they are considered sweet and a sign of what? Read it. fruitfulness. There's a Spanish word that one of the few Spanish words. It comes from a Spanish root. It's one of the few words in horiculture that comes from a Spanish root. Most of the horiculture words come from Latin roots. But there's a word that is used. It's briba. Brebba. It comes from the Hebrew. Really, it certainly has somehow extended from the Hebrew. But you'll hear an expression in in certain places, particularly Europe, and they'll say briba figs. And this is an early crop uh of figs that develop on the shoots, the stems of last year's wood. Now, how many of you understand what that means? It's simple. There are certain uh varieties of hydrangeas. That's a good southern flower. And there are certain uh varieties of hydrangeas that bloom on new shoots, new wood, new growth. You cut that new growth off, you won't have any flowers. &gt;&gt; But there are older varieties like a lot of us have that bloom on old wood. Yes. &gt;&gt; So last year's new wood is where the blooms will come this year. And it's that way with a fig tree. &gt;&gt; There is often an early small select crop of figs. Usually smaller than the regular harvest that come with the leaves or sometimes slightly before. It's possible under that Hebrew word first ripe. It's possible to have a few delicate, sweet little figs on a tree where there are no leaves at all, just buds about to break out into a leaf. Jesus knew what he was doing. He saw how beautiful the leaves had unfolded at Passover time, which is actually several months before there should have been a regular harvest of figs. But he judged by the outside and saw that there should have been some of those first ripe figs, those briba figs or bikura figs. But when he got there, he saw that this little bush was all about show. She had produced the most amazing crop of, you know, when a leaf first comes out, it's it's generally uh the most beautiful and unusual shade of green. Light green. Not quite like brother Gregory's shirt. Not maybe always quite that light green, but light green. lovely color. As the leaf hangs there a while, it deepens in its green. It gets darker and darker. He saw those beautiful light green fresh looking leaves. And he said, "Oh my, I'm going to have some fig here. I'm going to use this lesson to prophesy something over Israel. And I'm going to use this lesson to speak something to my disciples." And so it was not being unfair or unreasonable for him to expect there to have been figs even though it wasn't fig season. Are you following me? &gt;&gt; Isaiah 28:4. You don't have it. I didn't give it to you. I'm going to just give you a portion of it. It says, "And the glorious beauty shall be as a hasty fruit before summer." That that is the word bura. And it is the word that means when it says hasty fruit in English, that's what it means. one that has come on the tree before the regular crop of figs would even be on the tree. These figs were valued because of their sweetness. And here is something that you ought to know. If there are no bikura, if there are no breba or briba figs, if there are no early figs, it will absolutely affect the rest of the crop. So the sign that there were no early figs was a sign that something was seriously wrong in the in the root in the heart of this fig tree. You understand? &gt;&gt; The outside looked just right. The outside looked like it would be producing fruitful early figs and a bumper crop of normal figs in their season. But the reality is it was a showoff. It was a hypocrite, so to speak. And Jesus said, "I'm going to teach a lesson here. I'm going to show Israel this will." And listen, here we are today. I tell you, he picked a good one. Here we are today still talking about it, &gt;&gt; still preaching about what it meant and what it could mean. Around Passover, the spring trees with leaves should at least have those little tiny figs beginning to form. And the barrenness of this tree, no Breba figs, no early figs, was a sign that the coming crop would also fail. And perhaps the tree would not even make it through the next season. Something was seriously wrong. Not in the leaves. Where? One of the first things the Lord said to me in this season was, "I'm going to deal with hypocrisy &gt;&gt; with my people, in my people, in my bride first because the problem isn't in the leaf. It's not in the uniform. It's not particularly in the outward. It's something in the roots. It's something underneath the surface of the ground that I'm calling my people to deal with. I'm calling my people to deal with it so that I don't have to judge the whole tree. It's kind of a serious word. I'm closing. It's kind of a serious word. Musicians are coming. But this shows it wasn't about botany. It was about prophecy. Jesus wasn't looking for lunch. He was executing an act of judgment that would stand until the hour that we're living in today. In fact, the very next scene in Mark 11, do you know what it is? It's Jesus cleansing the temple. The very next scene after the cursing of the fig tree is Jesus going to the temple and cleansing it because you've made my father's house a house of merchandise. It's about getting ready for Passover. It's about getting all the the the the leavenan out. &gt;&gt; Let's deal with hypocrisy in the tree, he said. And then he goes into the temple and he cleanses it physically. And how many of you believe that was also a prophetic demonstration? &gt;&gt; God saying there's going to come a day because I don't want to live in this kind. I'm not looking for a house of stone. I'm looking for one of flesh. And I'm going to have a people that will do spiritual inventory &gt;&gt; from time to time. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? Aren't you glad that God gives us the opportunity from time to time as uh as old Jack Co used to sing? Aren't you glad he gives us opportunity from time to time to check up on our payments to the Lord? &gt;&gt; He used to sing that little chord. I'm I'm checking up on my payments to the Lord. I'm going to pay the debt I know I owe. into glory land. I will go because I'm checking up on my payments &gt;&gt; when that capstone come flying across the plane. I hope you can follow me. &gt;&gt; When I move from thing to thing &gt;&gt; when that capstone I'm I'm doing that's just one side of it. It's shaped like this. When that capstone we call it sometime a headstone, but I don't want you to think about the kind that's in the cemetery. This is the keystone. When the stonemasons build an arch, there's a keystone in the top of it. Very important. It's holding it all together. &gt;&gt; That keystone come loose, the arch collapses. &gt;&gt; So, we can call it capstone, keystone, headstone, all of those terms describing the same sort of term in masonry. When that capstone first it slides down, I thought it would set on top. I thought it would surely finish the building. &gt;&gt; Rather, it slides down and that black gloved hand swats it out of the way. And the scripture comes, that stone that the builders rejected, &gt;&gt; it was to be the cornerstone, &gt;&gt; but now I'm making it the chief. I'm making it the chief. One translator said the chief cornerstone. But the reality is he was rejected as a cornerstone. So that stone becomes the capstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You understand? Same same rock. &gt;&gt; Now it comes to hang down. This is for you that have followed me. &gt;&gt; It comes to to sit right there on the top. It is the final. It is the finishing touch. it. In fact, it's the most important part of the whole thing because without that, we're still looking. How many times do you think he said 80 pages worth? How do you know? Because I put them all in the same place this week. 80 pages worth of times, he said. And they haven't found it. And they don't know where it is. That great pyramid in Giza, it never had its capstone. It never had its headstone. It's prophecy. &gt;&gt; It's prophecy. Yes, it's prophecy. The Old Testament speaks about the pyramids. They're the only surviving memorial after the uh uh from from the time of the anti-dolivian. And he also talks about that and mentions that it's a memorial in the desert. It's a memorial in the sand. It's more than that. It's been a prophecy. Now, he's always careful to say, I'm not a I'm not one of those who follow the pyramid doctrine. And the reason why is there was something that was going around in that period of time is sometimes referred to as British Israelism. And it's this idea that Britain was a part of the last the lost tribes. It was being taught in the 20s and 30s among Pentecostals and and some of it was even taught around the message. Brother Brandham keeps distancing himself from this because what ended up happening to those people, they believe that the pyramid was deeply tied into Britain and they believed that the stone of scone was actually the the uh I know you don't want to hear all this, but you have to because there's somebody watching this that if I miss those points, &gt;&gt; they'll tell all over the world he's preaching pyramidology. Uh so I want you to know that we're not embracing Israel Britishism and all the different terms that have come to explain it. Uh the the stone of scone which is the stone I've seen the throne the the chair it sits under and u the kings and queens are coronated around that kind of thing. And um they were believing and and preaching in the 20s, 30s, 40s and even today there's a group still groups of people who believe that uh it later began to teach that Charles this was many years ago that Charles would then raise up to be the antichrist. And uh I could go on. You you'd be surprised if I told you the names of some of the people that followed that in the early days. Brother Brandham just kept separating himself from that. I'm not part of that. I'm not trying to put the religion in the pyramid and so forth. But remember, Brother Brandham leaned heavily on a writer by the name of Clarence Larkin. Nothing wrong with that. How do we know? Because we see that the things that he borrowed. And the the reason why that doesn't offend us is because we understand that that's really what men of God do. They research, they dig, they borrow, and then they have to depend on whatever their calling is or whatever their anointing is to be able to discern which of these things is worthy of the word. &gt;&gt; And that's why his ministry was so important. He helped us to see the things that line up with the word and the things that don't line up with the word. Are you still following me? &gt;&gt; Well, there's this uh what is the book called? Is it called Revelation? What is Larkin's book? one of his books called Revelation something. What is it? Dispensational what? Truth. That's right. That's right. Dispensational truth by Lin. There's a whole whole chapter in dispensational truth. We know brother Brandham read it because he he emphasized the theme of watchmen what of the night. He emphasized the church ages. He he was preaching there initially uh from from the influence of Larkin and the help of the Holy Spirit. He was preaching spirit, soul, body, early part of his ministry. One day he grabbed the wrong word and and stayed with it and and we don't worry about that because we understand what it means. But if you the same book has a whole chapter on the pyramid, who built the pyramid and and I have a lot I could tell you about the about that, but you didn't come to hear that today. There are many things in that chapter that he preached because he saw that it was the truth and people have understood it's it's a sign. It's a memorial. We're not we're not a uh uh we don't follow uh astrology, but we know that God placed a truth in the skies first and foremost before we had a written record of the word. And then he put one out there in the desert. And then he put one in printed form. Hallelujah. Thank God. Because I might not have been able to count all the steps in the pyramid of Giza and get the message. And I might not have been able to remember the names of all the stars and get the message. But brother, I can tuck this book not only under my arm, but in my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's amazing that one doesn't contradict the other. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? But when that when that pyramid came flying across, now this would would wouldn't have been so profound had I have known all these things from the message. But at this time, I was still pretty green. And so when God would show me something, I'd go right to the message to search it out and see if I could find anything in there that would help me understand what I saw. But when that when that little capstone I thought, "Oh, it's going back up. It's going to, this is vision one, trans vision number one. Um, it's going to go back up there and crown the pyramid. But instead, it came flying across the plane with shouts of grace, grace, as Zachariah said, and struck me right there. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; It's amazing because brother Brandham uses the language about striking. He says the same thing. I found it. He says the same thing about that capstone striking the bride. This is just a symbol the forehead but remember what it represents sir &gt;&gt; that is the that's a that's the intellect that's actually and and intellect is not wrong &gt;&gt; unless you lean on this and not what God reveals here &gt;&gt; but it starts here brother Bram said even faith as a revelation starts here &gt;&gt; as a mental concept &gt;&gt; truth starts as a mental concept come on drops down to the heart there was something on that I know you're listening some of you &gt;&gt; there was one eye Crazy, strange. The Bible says the eyes of the Lord. But there was just one eye. If you follow the message, you hear Brother Bam saying, "Oh," he said, "I know that." He said, "They call that the seal of the United States. That ought to be maybe the seal of Egypt or something. the seal of, you know, he he talks about the different things on the dollar bill, but he said, "I'll tell you that eye, it it may mean something in pagan world. It may mean something inh uh, you know, mythologies and false religion, but he said, I'll tell you what it represents to me. It's the allseeing eye of God." &gt;&gt; And he breaks out in the old song we used to sing. Some of you aren't old enough to remember the old hymn. It's probably in the red book. There's an eye watching you. All along on the road to the soul's true abode, there's an eye watching you. Everything that you do, there's an eye watching you. And somebody said that is enough to terrify the children. It must not be. That's a That's the That's the lie that they that they placed on Santa Claus. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what they told us? Uh he knows when you've been naughty. He knows when you've been good. He knows you. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; That's because uh they were trying to put Santa Claus in in where God belongs &gt;&gt; because he he's not real. So he couldn't know what's going on at your house. &gt;&gt; He knows when you've been sleeping. Come on. He knows when you're awake. and that and that you know what I sing when I there's an eye watching you and it's not Santa Claus. &gt;&gt; It's an allseeing eye of God. &gt;&gt; And and that don't terrify me. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Doesn't it terrify you when you're weak? It does not. &gt;&gt; Doesn't it terrify you when you're naughty? It does not. Because I know that if I can trust that eye, &gt;&gt; he didn't come to watch me to condemn me. &gt;&gt; He come to watch me to help me get over whatever it is &gt;&gt; that's trying to hold me earthbound. And brother, when I'm navigating like you are the the the narrow uh you know turns and curves of the mountain trying to get up, I'm glad that I &gt;&gt; there's no judgment in that eye &gt;&gt; for his wife. And &gt;&gt; it struck as a as a representation of the of the crowning. He sometimes called it a crowning. Sometimes he called it a capping. But here's what you need to remember. It cannot strike you. He said until everything else has been formed. I'm going to say birthed because I saw it as contractions of a woman's delivery. The contractions of a woman in labor because it's a manchild. It's Christ. &gt;&gt; It's Christ. Somebody said, "Where where do you get that kind of language?" The New Testament. Forgive me. The New Testament. He said, "I travail, little children. I travail in in in in travailing uh like birth painans until Christ be formed &gt;&gt; in you." And the greatest glory of this end time bride is that Christ is formed in her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. And he said you can't have the crowning, the capping until you lay the foundation. And what did he say the foundation was? Faith. Stature of the perfect man. Faith is the foundation. Anybody in here got faith? Let me see your hand. You got faith. God can build on that. &gt;&gt; If you got faith, he can build on that. &gt;&gt; How? He can build on that. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't have no faith." You're unscriptural. You do have faith. Unto every man is given a measure of faith. &gt;&gt; The faith is there. But there's another faith. &gt;&gt; There's another faith that births. There's another faith that forms and that is a super sense of faith. And if we could have finished this, we would have gotten to that because Jesus turns to them. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think I will. &gt;&gt; It won't take a m but a minute. Oh, you said that already. Who knows? I think some of you are mad. I don't know when I'll see you again. Don't shake my hand and tell me how good it was if you clamped down and sat down on me when I was trying to deliver it. Just keep it to yourself. I always depend on Brother Robert. And it's not just because he wants his voice heard, but it is heard. It is heard on every recording. And when he's not here, it's missed and needed like like yours. In 11:22, Jesus answering saith unto them, have faith in God. He's just cursed the tree. In the morning in verse 20, they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots. And Peter calling to remembrance saith unto him, Master, behold the fig tree which thou cursest is withered away. I want you to know them disciples wasn't quite sure what was going on. &gt;&gt; He must have not really wanted breakfast if he cursed the very thing that might could have given us breakfast tomorrow. And then Jesus answered, saith unto them, have faith in God. My he's going to preach on the foundation of it all now. Have faith in God. For verily I say unto you, that whatsoever or whosoever shall say unto this mountain, be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass, he shall have whatsoever. &gt;&gt; He saith, that's verse 23. He shall have whatsoever. He saith. &gt;&gt; Am I not reading it right? Believing you sh I must have I'm sorry. I must be reading in a different translation. didn't even know it. And all things whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing. Well, doesn't this I think that was about the same, wasn't it? Pretty close. He was teaching a faith lesson to the disciples. &gt;&gt; Oh, yes. &gt;&gt; He was bringing a prophetic rebuke to Israel, &gt;&gt; but he was teaching the talmine, have faith. &gt;&gt; You see what happens when you curse something? The the root the the death strikes the root. Now, when brother Brandon preached on that, you know what he talked about? Cancer. He probably I don't know, but every time I read it recently, he went straight to cancer. He said the root if if if if we only understood, if we only knew the authority that we have, &gt;&gt; we would speak the word of faith, that thing would death would strike the root of it. and choke out the life of the tumor potentially every time. &gt;&gt; Do you always see that result? No. Because God has a program and a plan that we try to understand, but we fall very short of understanding it. &gt;&gt; But it never changes the principle. The principle is if you can get the life out of the tumor. &gt;&gt; Well, just ask the doctor. That's what he's trying to do &gt;&gt; is get life out of the tumor. &gt;&gt; 50 plus years ago, they started telling people don't feed the tumor. The first thing you do when you find out you've got something like that, you you stop all processed food and no sugar of any form of any kind. That's what they started. maybe longer maybe 70 years ago they were saying it beginning to say it because those things feed the life of the tumor. Ain't that interesting? You hear brother Brandham didn't know a whole lot about science didn't know a whole lot about neur neurosciences particularly but boy could he lay it out there &gt;&gt; you cut the life off. &gt;&gt; Boy, I'm feeling bad. Haven't you done that with a wart? Haven't you done that with a skin tag? &gt;&gt; Have you ever tried to cut the life out of that thing &gt;&gt; and watch it shrivel to die? Whatever it is that's ailing us, whatever's growing in us, it's foreign, it's not ours, it's not of us, it's not of our cell structure, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; There's power and authority in the name, in the word, in the book, in the book, in the name, in the blood. And we ought to use it. I tell you, we ought to use it when we need it. And that's that would be just about every day. Let's stand. Let's revoke the enemy's easy pass. There's an eagle that soarses around this little bride. It It's It's prayer. His name is prayer. It &gt;&gt; He He He's here to take your needs higher than you can get them. Uh intellectual faith can only get them so far. But when that super sense of faith kicks in, &gt;&gt; Lord, we love you today. I want to be in the center of your will. The reality is, Lord, we just don't always pray about what we do. I started to say earlier, but I really got the wind kind of knocked out of me in the beginning. But I I started to say to the people then uh I wonder how many of you really pray about uh decisions you make and uh trips you plan and where you're going to be when you're going to be there. I I wonder I was going to see if I could even get people to raise their hand. I I I know it's like this. You say, "Pray for me." And everybody says, "Well, I'm going to pray for you." And sometimes, you know, in your heart that you are not going to be in their mind until they see you again. It's kind of hurtful. And we we have to believe that there's somebody that means what they say. And they're taking our name before the Lord daily. I believe it. I believe there's a saint in this house. I believe there are people in this house that if they tell you, "I'm going to pray for you," they do. And I'm very thankful for those prayers. Aren't you? I I wonder if you say to somebody, "Did you pray about it?" "Oh, yes, I prayed about it." I like to take it further sometimes. I don't do it as often as I should. I like to take it further and say, "Well, what did he say?" Well, he didn't really say anything. Well, then how do you know? How do you know his will? just because you asked him if it was so. Where was the answer? Lord, you said you were going to lead us even with your eye. Oh, [Music] thank you for the eye of the Lord. The steadfast and faithful eyes of the Lord. They they watch over us. As I stand here, I'm reminded of that white eagle that hovered over the bed that night some many years ago. Two laser lights, red glowing laser lights down on my chest as he examined again the base nature of who I am. And it so reminded me, Lord, that in one glance, you know everything there is to know about me and not me only, but your people. We don't want to walk in condemnation nor guilt, but we want to walk with a sense of care and concern for our spiritual health. And when we need help, we want to wave the flag for somebody to see, I need help. It's not not all about a feeling. It's about faith. Father, I ask you today if you would pour some oil on our faith. Take it to a higher level as we come together just now to worship you before we leave. Precious Lord, precious Jesus, don't go too far. We have a little baby to dedicate. Father, I see that you are drawing a line in the sand and I want to be standing on your side, holding your hand. So let your kingom come. Let it live in me. This is my prayer. This is my plea. And father, I see that you are drawing a line in the sand. And I want to be standing on your side, holding your hand. So let your kingom come. Let it live in me. This is my prayer. This is my plea. Let the worshippers arise. Let the sons and the daughters sing. I'm surrendering my all. I surrender to the king. Oh, let the worshippers arise. [Music] Let the sons and the daughters sing. Lord, I'm surrendering my all. I surrender to the king. And father, I hear it growing louder. It's the song of your redeemed. As the saints of every nation, they're awakening to sing. And from our heart there comes an anthem. Oh, to hear the heavens ring. This is our song. Oh, a song to our king. Let the worshippers arise. Oh, let the sons and the daughters sing. Oh, I'm surrendering my all. I surrender to the king. I surrender to the king. Oh, let the worshippers arise. [Music] Let the sons and the daughters sing. Oh, I'm surrendering my all. [Music] I surrender to the king. Oh, let the worippers arise. Let the sons and the daughters sing. I'm surrendering my all. I surrender to the king. [Music] set up [Music] that I can't control. I want more of you, God. And I want more of you, God. Set a fire down in my soul that I can't contain, that I can't control. I want more of you, God. I want more of you, God. Set a fire down in my soul that I can't contain, that I can't control. I want more of you, God. Oh, I want more of you, God. Won't you set a fire down in my soul that I can't contain, that I can't control? I want more of you, God. And we want more of you, God. Won't you set a fire down in my soul that I can't contain, that I can't control? I want more of you, God. And I want more of you, God. There's no place I would rather be. No place I would rather be. There's no place I would rather be. Oh, then here in your love. Here in your love. And no place I would rather be. There's no place I would rather be. And no place I would rather be. Oh, then here in your love. Right here in your love. There no place I would rather be. There's no place I would rather be. Oh, no place I would rather be than here in your love. Right here in your love. Set a fire down in my soul that I can't contain, that I can't control. I want more of you, God. And I want more of you, God. Won't you set a fire down in my soul that I can't contain, Lord, that I can't control? I want more of. Oh, we want more. Won't you set a fire down in my soul that we can't contain, that we can't control. Oh, we want more of you, God. Oh, we want more of you, God. Set a fire down in my soul that I can't contain, that I can't control. I want more of you, God. And I want more of you, God. Oh, we want more. Lord, we come to you today. &gt;&gt; We heard your word this morning, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, any access we've allowed to the enemy, &gt;&gt; we retract it. &gt;&gt; We take it back. We take authority over our families, over our homes. We say you have no place. &gt;&gt; You're not welcome in a child of God's home. You're not welcome on this property. any access that we've allowed on this property. Lord, we take it back. &gt;&gt; Lord, we thank you for this place. We thank you for the the peace that we feel when we drive on. &gt;&gt; Let us not take that for granted, Lord. &gt;&gt; Let us take what we've heard seriously. Let us take this time seriously. Let us press into what you have for us. Not just when we come corporately, Lord, but every day. &gt;&gt; Whenever we can have a minute, a second, &gt;&gt; Lord, we ask that you would just speak to us. Speak to us as individuals, Lord. &gt;&gt; In this season, let us have a servant's heart. &gt;&gt; When we see a need, Lord, we ask that you would just give us a servant's heart. Even if that's not a part of our nature, Lord, I ask that you would just give us that heart to say, "Yes, I'll do it." Lord, I ask that you would just help us in this season. Help us to prepare our our lives &gt;&gt; as we come into camp meeting. Lord, we ask that we would prepare our lives to be able to help someone else. &gt;&gt; Use us for your glory, Lord. Use us for your glory, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We thank you, Lord. We thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, we just by faith claim every promise &gt;&gt; that you have made us in your word, &gt;&gt; every promise that you have personally made by your spirit to us. &gt;&gt; We realize and recognize that some of it requires labor. It requires preparation. And we come to you again asking for grace, strength, leadership to prepare our hearts. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; the one thing that we never want is to forfeit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to claim. We want to possess. &gt;&gt; You said footsteps means possession. We want to step all over our promises, claim them as our own, &gt;&gt; not let them filter &gt;&gt; to someone else because we refuse. &gt;&gt; We say yes &gt;&gt; to whatever you have for us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; we step into your feast and we take the lowest seat. We'll be faithful in the few things &gt;&gt; because you said Lord that if we would be faithful in the few things, you would give us rulership and authority over many things. &gt;&gt; So we surrender to you right now. Lord, I pray for every mom, every dad, every husband, every wife. If there is any way, and I don't mean fanaticism, Lord, may we not go out of here paranoid, may we go out of here spiritled, Lord, &gt;&gt; but may we go out conscientious and sensitive to your spirit. Show us, Lord, anywhere, anything that we might have taken in that has caused the enemy &gt;&gt; to have the easy path. I saw, Lord, that there were angels that had actually tried to on our behalf revoke the enemy's privilege. But I saw that it was not their responsibility and therefore their efforts could not be successful. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you have called us to be Lord over our homes, over our families. And when we say that, not in a rulership way, but in a way to claim authority and responsibility. &gt;&gt; And we do that right now. We want our children's minds to be clean and wholesome and holy. and we want to see them growing in the things of God. And how can we sew into someone else's life when we're allowing the enemy such uh such free range in our own business? We just say you're a trespasser regardless. You knew when you walked in you didn't belong here. And we say to the Lord, forgive us, oh God, for laying down our responsibility as watchmen for our family, for our household, but we also thank you for the leadership and wisdom that the Holy Spirit brings to our lives. And we just say we surrender. Why don't you just do that now? I realize some of you are struggling. I pray God will give you grace and help you get over it. Nonetheless, we're here to surrender. &gt;&gt; We lay it all before you, Lord. We thank you for every good and perfect gift. &gt;&gt; It's because of you. It's because of you. Thank you for the prayer warriors. &gt;&gt; Thank you for those who stand in the gap. Thank you for those who strain the hardest to hear your voice in all things. You're holy. You're so holy, Lord. &gt;&gt; You're holy, Jesus. Somebody just tell him with your words, you're holy, God. You're holy. You're set apart from everything else. You're holy. May we walk before you in holiness. It's the character of God. &gt;&gt; It's not religion. It's not fancy leaves. The scripture goes on to say, you'll you'll know a tree not by the leaves, not by the healthy color. You'll know a tree by the fruit it bears. Lord, may we bear fruit in this season. I remember the man in the Bible who said, "Oh, oh, give me a chance. Let me prune it. Let me let me fertilize it. Let me dig around it." Right? Let me see if I can't save. Let's see if I can't get the life moving again. Lord, may we be that steward today. &gt;&gt; May we say, "Oh, God, give me the grace to dig around my own roots. and we just prophesy life to the root &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Just lay your hand gently and quickly on someone next to you. Father, we stand in agreement &gt;&gt; with one another. We want to see each other go higher. &gt;&gt; I want to see brothers go higher. I want to see sisters go higher. I want our teenagers higher. our children, Lord, each discerning on their own level the importance, the priorities. We want to see them growing. We want to see them soaring, [Music] strengthened in every way. If the foundation is right, the house can be built right. &gt;&gt; If the foundation is wrong, &gt;&gt; the house will fall flat. Lord, let us get the faith foundation right right now. Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. May we see that a relationship with you &gt;&gt; is not just a small part of our life. &gt;&gt; It's the reason why we were born. Lord, bless my sister. Bless my brother, bless those who have an active visible part and those who behind the scenes carry a great portion of the load. Let peace surround us. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't call this a peaceful service, but you're a peaceful God. &gt;&gt; Let peace surround us. as we come and give this little beautiful baby girl back to you. Come, Lord, and remind us of the great value of life. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; How fleeting it can be. Greet your brother, your sister that you're with. And when you can, slip back to your seat. We're going to make this as quick as possible for those of you who are in a hurry and need to go now. It's been a long service. Ben and Kendra, come and whoever's coming to stand with you, whoever you've asked to do that. Today is Fouse's birthday. We say happy birthday to Sister Fouse in Japan. Tuesday is Paul West's birthday and he's getting uh to the place of almost being Hawaii, but not quite, but almost. Uh, it would have been our beautiful Jennifer's birthday on Tuesday. There are no birthdays in heaven. I'm sorry to disappoint you there. It's called eternity. The days don't run in 365 days. The years don't run in 365 days. Every day, if you if you love your birthday, every day is your birthday. If you hated your birthday, you'll never have one. So, it doesn't matter. And on Tuesday is Ezekiel Joseph's birthday. Grace, and that's what mom and daddy need lots of. Where is he? Hey, it's your birthday coming up. Hi. And then Saturday is Hannah Elizabeth's birthday. Where is she? Happy birthday. And today is Vivian's day, not her birthday. I'm sorry. I could have My legs aren't the big part of me. It's up here. I could have got by. I hope you can always be as sweet as you are beautiful. You'll have to work hard at it because you are some pretty. This is pat. You don't have to fret. Close your eyes. Go right back to sleep. Father, Lord Jesus, we thank you for this beautiful baby girl that you've given to Ben and Kendra. Lord, we lift Vivian Joe up to you. And we just ask, oh God, that you would continue to surround her in every way. bless her body physically, keep her whole. Uh Lord, uh anoint her immune system to fight off all the germs and things that go around to make us sick. Lord, may she be protected in every other way until she's old enough to make you her choice. We're so thankful for her. We're so thankful. May she, Lord, know that she is deeply loved by her mom and dad and sisters and her extended family, her faith family. May she never have to wonder. May she always know. Lord, use her. If you've let her be born here at the end time, there must be a purpose for her life that perhaps is bigger than generations before her. Use her for your glory. May her mind be protected from the onslaught of this wicked world around us. May she never know the sting of Leodysia. May she only know the peace of those who live in the city. Glory be to God. You see how she's looking? I see you. Excuse us. We're just having a moment. I see you want to smile, but you're not sure. Now, let Daddy pray. God didn't give you to me. I tried to take you. It didn't work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. She laughed. You see her? She went, "God gave you to Ben and Kendra Ellsworth." So, they're the only ones that can give you back to God. Oh my. You're like candy. Can you pray loud without the mic? Cheese. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. [Music] Lord, we thank you for this extended family, for Mimi and uncles and aunts and cousins. And Lord, we just ask also for the church family that we could be all that she would need us to be. She's not just another baby in the church. Lord, everyone you give us, we want to see their value and realize the great responsibility of stewarding a life, trying to move a spirit, a soul toward you. May we take it seriously. Why don't you all turn around and let everybody see how beautiful she's looking today? And because he lives, [Music] I can face &gt;&gt; tomorrow [Music] because he lives. You're still too. All fear is gone. And because I know congratulations [Music] big sisters, &gt;&gt; cousins &gt;&gt; and life is worth a living. Let me get Isaiah. &gt;&gt; I love you. &gt;&gt; You okay? You're bandaged. And because he lives. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. For a minute &gt;&gt; tomorrow [Music] because he lives. &gt;&gt; Look around all these people. &gt;&gt; All fear is gone. &gt;&gt; Stranger than others, but they're all good people. on because I know I know he holds the future. [Music] My life is worth the living just because he lives. How sweet to hold a newborn baby and feel the pride [Music] and joy they bring. You do. You do. God greater still this calm assur. Am I startling you? &gt;&gt; This child Vivian can face uncertain days because he lives. Sing the last time. And because he lives, &gt;&gt; because Jesus lives, I can face tomorrow. &gt;&gt; There's no doubt about it &gt;&gt; because he lives. Oh, all fear is gone. on because I know he holds my future. [Music] &gt;&gt; My life &gt;&gt; in my life is worth living just because he lives. Lord, go with us and keep us in your tender care and help us to serve you with all that we are. In the lovely name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." Amen. You're dismissed to go. Who are you looking at? Who are you looking at, Vivian? [Music] [Music]
