TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right I Christ in you the hope a lord [Music] hello I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and I'm coming to you today on behalf of the gospel channel I want us to thank the Lord rejoice today for the gospel Channel and the work that they're doing to spread the good news of the Lord Jesus Christ and not only that I'm excited about the opportunity that we have to grow in our relationship with the Lord I believe there are people who will watch the gospel Channel who have never made a commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ and that excites me if I could just have a little part in helping you to know the reality of who Jesus is and what a difference he makes in your life well that would be wonderful it really would be but I'm also thankful that it's an opportunity to grow in our walk with the Lord to learn more about who he is and how do we do that we do that by the revelation of his word and so we just want to thank God for this opportunity and I always like to ask you to join us in prayer for brother Eric Erickson and the staff at the gospel channel and I also pray for all of those other ministers who are also given this opportunity to speak to you through the means of television and I pray that God will increase them and bless them and continue to reveal himself to them you know this is a body ministry in the end time and each of us including you have a part to add to building the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is not buildings it's not a churches or programs the kingdom of God is giving Jesus a throne that he can live inside of you jesus said that the kingdom of God is within men and so when we build ourselves up in the truth of God's Word we are helping to establish the kingdom of God and so I just want to say again how blessed we are to be a part of the gospel channel and I also represent our ministry new hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama USA and we want to invite you to contact us by telephone by email by snail mail if you have a prayer request the intercessors of our church would be so happy to pray with you to believe God with you we have even learned a few of our callers by name and I want you to know that your phone call is logged if there's no one to answer it it's still logged by the message that you leave and I look over them not only does the staff see them but I see them each and every day I can access them on my telephone if I'm not in the office and when I check those requests those calls then I go to the Lord in prayer I can also hear your your message that you leave remotely wherever I am I can hear your voice and I can hear your need and sometimes I can hear the cry of desperation sometimes I hear faith rising up in you as you share what you have need of and as I said a moment ago we're learning some of you by name and I love that I appreciate that it's been many years since I was in the United Kingdom or Scotland or Ireland I've been in all three to Minister the gospel in person but look what the Lord has done he gives me this opportunity to be near my home in Alabama and still be able to speak to you and I pray that it's an encouragement to you we've been talking about in our time together recently the Word of God and the importance of standing strong for the word of God taking sides with the Word of God not compromising in in a day where there is a whole lot of calm my's going on around us I believe that we certainly should love everyone pray for everyone believe that Jesus has a salvation plan that reaches all ethnicities all nations even religions because sometimes people are born into a religion and it's all they know well I want you to know that I believe personally that there is but one way to God in this hour for the Gentile nations and that is through salvation in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he is the way he is the truth he is the life and so in this day people are coming to salvation by many means by witnessing you know I I you people who still preach on the street corner some in the UK in fact may be handing out tracts maybe by the local church maybe by a little saying on the sign outside the church house and people see it and they're compelled to come and they hear the great story the love story that God so loved this world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth on him might not perish but have everlasting eternal life and that's where the journey begins that's not the ending of the journey that's the beginning of the Christian journey and so I'm just thankful that there are many many testimonies we get to hear them of what God is doing in the nations of the world and we're thankful to have a small part in that but I want you to know there's a lot of things going on that that never get reported on the on the Christian news we never read about them on Facebook or social media but I want you to know God's got some faithful witness says in many many places some of which it's illegal some of the places it's illegal to witness to speak about the truth of salvation through Jesus Christ and there are brave and courageous soldiers of the Cross who are sharing the gospel and when we get to hear of a testimony like that someone going into some of those places I hesitate to even name the places but when we hear that God is opening the spiritually blinded eyes of so many and bringing them to a place of salvation and hope some of them say for the first time in their life well it's a blessing and it's an encouragement and I hope that it will encourage you to keep sharing your faith when we've been talking about the Word of God and the importance of the Word of God it's about living the word and we cannot do that but by the power of the Holy Spirit it's only because of his presence his divine spirit life-giving spirit that lives inside of us that we can even begin to have the strength or the power or the courage to live the Christian life we're not talking about a religious life of only do's and don'ts and rules and restrictions I believe that God gives us instructions in his word that we should live by that I'm not talking about that I'm talking about a relationship I'm talking about learning of him learning of him letting him reveal himself to you in a very personal way I'd like to read a portion of scripture to you today that we shared in one of our times together and that was from 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 and verse 18 and it speaks about one degree of glory to another it speaks about with unveiled face beholding the glory Corie of the Lord and being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another I love this concept of one degree of glory to another and I started looking at that word that's used several times in the Bible in Romans chapter 12 and verse 2 it's also used so let's let's grab that verse here for just a moment Romans chapter 12 verse 2 do not be conformed to this world this age fashioned after and adapted to its external superficial customs but be transformed in parentheses that reached changed by the entire renewal of your mind oh my that's where it begins and that's where it continues is in our mind our ability to be renewed in our mind by the by the entire renewal of your mind by its new ideals and its new attitude I want you to know that a relationship with the Living Word standing with the Living Word the Lord Jesus Christ it is a place of finding new attitude and new thoughts I remember the old timers in the Pentecostal church that I grew up in they would often testify and say the things that I once loved I now hate and the things that I once hated and despised I now love I'll never forget those precious testimonies some of them I knew their life later as I grew older I learned just how far God had brought them from and it made me appreciate their testimony even more but that's what the scripture says old things Paul tells us the great apostle old things have passed away and behold all things become new changed a new attitude a new desire new loves and even the opportunity to to refrain to stand away from some of the things that the spirit of this age would use to grab ahold of us and pull us in perhaps to some form of addiction or destructive behavior I want you to know you can be a new creature if you can learn to yield and trust the Living Word of God Jesus Christ living inside of you by a spirit do not be conformed to this world this age fashioned after and adapted to its external superficial customs but be transformed changed by the entire renewal of your mind by its new ideas ideals and its new attitude so that you may prove for yourselves what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God even the thing which is good and acceptable and perfect in his sight for you this is very interesting to me the way the amplified bible brings this out in order to discover God's will for your life the reason you were born that's what God's will is if you can find what God's will is for your life you can discover the reason that you were born you know mine is simple I know that that I was called to preach the gospel and I know different aspects of the ministry that the Lord gave me when I was just a child but if I boiled it all down to one simple phrase and you asked me a question were you born I would have to say it this way I was born to serve the Lord I know that I don't know that because the pastor told me the preacher told me my grandmother told me or my parents told me I know it because it became a living reality to me by the precious power of the Holy Spirit you see it's the Spirit of God let me make sure that you get what I'm trying to say and that is it's the Spirit of God the presence of God his life his breath that makes the written word live and become personal to us and Paul is saying here we are not to be conformed to this world patterning our life after the spirit of the age around us but rather we're to be transformed that's the same word in the Greek it it is Metamorpho and of course I think that would be a little familiar to some of you because you've heard this scientific concept of metamorphosis it's the process by which the caterpillar becomes a butterfly and hey there's a whole lot that happens in between you see that little worm crawling on your rosebush and then later you begin to see the butterflies fluttering fluttering around your garden you've got to remember there's a whole process between worm and butterfly there's the spinning first that's eating everything in sight that's kind of like that's kind of like the Christian who discovers the power of the word of God and the nourishment really spiritual nourishment that we receive from the word and we're just gorging eating everything I remember I remember those times in my Christian journey when my hunger for God's Word was bigger than I was and I couldn't get enough of it and I tell you when you get in a place like that stay there as long as you possibly can I believe there are herbs and flows in the Christian journey I believe we have to always diligently read the Word of God but I don't believe that that our whole journey is a journey of just gorging and reading and listening to teaching and I believe there are times where we have to begin to process what we have read and what we have heard and we have to decide what our response and what our reaction is going to be and then we move forward and we begin to continue that growing process but I can see that also we use the word metamorphosis the little tadpole in the in the creek out there that it has a little tail it looks like a little pollywog a little a little fishy looking thing and over a process of metamorphosis that tail drops off and legs begin to grow and the next thing you know you've got a jumping frog in the garden spooking you if you're down trying to take care of the of the flowers every time I see a frog every time I see a butterfly I actually think about this process of metamorphosis where we are transformed by the renewing of our mind transformed by beholding the glory of the Lord with an unveiled face looking upon his image in the word from one degree of glory to another or as we just read not being conformed but being transformed all from this concept of metamorphosis being changed right back to what we said a moment ago the old old man gone and a new man a new creation in Jesus Christ I want you to know that I I'm sensing as I'm sharing with you right now that that many are listening who have had what you might call a false start you begin to trust the Lord with your life you heard the Gospel message you repented of your sins you began that process of being a new Christian and somehow along the way you had the wind knocked out of you life got tough in a hurry and hey let me go ahead and tell any of you that haven't experienced that it can come it's because the enemy is not going to lay down the one who is banished to hell enemy your enemy Lucifer the one who was a created cherub of God but by his own pride he tried to exalt himself against the knowledge of God and the throne of God and he fell and we know him as Satan and yes he is real I know there may be people watching this broadcast that you don't believe in a literal devil but I want you to know if you look around you and you see what evil is doing and you say well that's just man's heart oh no I want you to know there's a greater darkness than just the heart of man that follows after evil there is a devil and he's not going to lay down and play dead while you grow in the grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ he's going to do everything he can we say to pull the rug out from under you he wants to turn your life upside down he does not want you to surrender to your Creator so you can expect a battle when you start out to serve the Lord so to those of you who had the start and then you fail and some of you fell hard and the discouragement and sometimes even the embarrassment of a failing kept you from starting again and pressing in and so you have sort of watched the things of God from a distance you keep up with some of the things that are going on with family members who are believers or you watch on occasion Christian television but you're not following the Lord mostly as you did in the beginning I'm speaking to you right now from his love for you you can do it you can recommit your life to him he allows you turns you turn to him the circumstances of life your enemy come with a with a vengeance you know he came with a vengeance to try to destroy you and you and maybe your feet were knocked out from under you and you just over a period of time gave up I want to call you in the name of the Lord I want to call you out of that place of of what you feel like was a failure I want to call you up I want to encourage you that you can make it not by your strength not by your good works not by your talent or your intellect but by grace you are saved it is a gift of God you must believe for that grace you must believe that that gift is given to you and by faith accept it and receive it once you repent of of any failure that you made or any embarrassment that you might have brought on the name of the Lord disappointment for with others and you you feel bad about it and so you say lord please have mercy on me give me grace to rise again to walk in wisdom and slowly until you feel yourself strengthened this is what I invite you to do I invite you to begin again it's not too late if there's breath in your body and you feel the pull toward the things of God for me this means that you have not committed the unpardonable sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost you no matter how deep your sin has gone no matter how many lives you have affected in a very negative way by your choices there is still grace for you and the very fact that you'd stop and listen to this kind of message right now and the fact that you would feel but drawing toward the Lord to me is evidence that there's hope for you that God is reaching out to you and you may just discover as I discovered a long time ago that you were born to serve the Lord as I was born to serve the Lord we serve Him differently according to the gifts and the callings and the talents that he gives us in life but to serve Him is our reason for being here to love him and to point others to that relationship of restoration bringing us back into fellowship with our Creator our Creator loved us so much that he became flesh and lived the life of a man in a man's body suffered great rejection great pain great agony on the cross and shed his blood and yet he did not fail us that's the love that God has for you let me just read a scripture that came in my mind as we were talking and I didn't mean to leave you hanging there but I just felt like there was someone who needed to get up again and I know it may not be easy for you but but would you try would you try not in your strength when I say try I mean make up your mind that's the one thing you can do it's really the only thing you can do is to make up your mind to accept God's gift to you and begin again the rest of it is in his hands he'll take it don't worry he'll help you bear the burden that you might have to bear getting started or continuing the journey whichever it is he is for you and not against you he wants to draw you into himself he's not trying to push you away he's trying to draw you in come back all backslider hear the Lord hear the Lord come back to him make your heart with a new commitment give a new commitment from your heart to the Lord John 1:1 amplified version says in the beginning before all time was the word and in the amplified it says Christ and the Word was with God and the Word was God himself this is the promise of the scripture the prophet Isaiah prophesied that he would come and that he would be Almighty God Yahshua the Messiah Jesus Christ our Savior our Lord was and is the word of God made flesh he became a high priest on our behalf and in order to really know what our life is like and the feelings and temptations of of the human life on earth he came down and became like us I tell you I've known that a long time by revelation and I've preached it hundreds of times and yet it excites me to say it thirty years later after preaching it well actually a few more years than thirty but anyway it still excites me to say that he loved me so much that he wanted to be a high priest who could be touched with the feeling of my infirmities and he knows my temptations and he knows the weaknesses of the human flesh and he was tempted in all manner like we are without sin and he said I have overcome the world and because I have guess what you can to just get up and get going again I really encourage you to do that this word transformed metamorphosis is not our responsibility it's God's responsibility what do we do we keep looking at the word we're talking about Jesus Christ the Living Word but how do we know him more how do we begin to understand his love for us more we look to the written word so truthfully there is change in the written word of God but for total transformation in our life it can only come when the written word is made alive when it's quickened by the very spirit of Jesus Christ living inside of the believer we need the Holy Spirit I'm not going to beat around the bush because I love you we need the Holy Spirit in our lives we need not just the spirit of transformation or the spirit of conversion we sometimes say the Spirit of the Lord that comes in when we are originally converted when we originally surrender to salvation but I mean I mean the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Spirit where we're not just filled up with his spirit but then we are baptized immersed filled up and filled all around us with the Spirit of God we need that because that's the atmosphere totally immersed totally wrapped up in the Spirit of God and that happens by creating the right atmosphere in reading in worship in prayer he surrounds us he fills us were baptized with his life and it's in that place that real transformation real metamorphosis by the Spirit takes place in our life I was going to read another portion of Scripture I think I have time to go there revelation one of my favorite books of the Bible people often say oh I'm scared that's a southern way of saying scared I think you probably got it I'm scared of the book of Revelation because I read about great wrath and great judgment and hailstones falling and and woes and plagues and seals and all kinds of trumpets and vials yes you do there's some very serious things some of which have already happened on planet earth in its history some of which are happening now and some of which are to happen in the future but I don't find the book of Revelation to be a scary book because a great portion of the book of Revelation actually takes place before the throne of God you're focusing on what's happening on planet earth and indeed we would because this is where we live for now is planet Earth but what we have to do is set our affection on things above we have to begin to read the book of Revelation and understand also what's happening before the throne of God and I tell you when you begin to recognize that you've got a home beyond the one you live in now you've got a body to live in beyond the one that you live in now you have a promised destiny of of eternal life if you're willing to accept it and only you can make that choice it can't be made for you where time has no hold on you anymore and thank god there's no old age there is another place and much of that is also revealed in the book of Revelation so approach that book like you approach any other book with prayer and with allowing God's Holy Ghost power to come and inspire you and quicken you and make the Word of God real to you then you may indeed have something to warn your neighbors about but don't let your focus be only on the things transitioning transpiring on planet earth but also remember that you've got something waiting on you that's revealed before the throne of God Revelation chapter 1 this is John on the Isle of Patmos in the spirit on the Lord's Day and that means he was caught up by the Spirit of God to the day of the Lord and I I believe he saw my day I believe he saw this hour we're living in right now also and I believe that some of the things that we read about are for our generation and beyond but I want to look at verse 12 a moment then I turn to see whose was the voice that was speaking to me and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man clothed with a robe which reached to his feet and with a girdle of gold about his breast his head and his hair were white like white wool as white as snow and his eyes flashed like a flame of fire verse 15 his feet glowed like bright burnished bronze as it is refined in the furnace and his voice was like the sound of many waters in his right hand he held seven stars and from his mouth there came forth a sharp two-edged sword and his face was like the sun shining in full power at midday but I wanted to focus on verse 17 with you for a moment I wanted to focus on John's response to the word remember we've been emphasizing the word the Word of God both written and living we also talked about being careful what you hear and being careful how you hear the word of God how important it is to go back and revisit the truths that we hear and let God unveil them to us personally and having the right response and the right reaction I want you to listen at John's reaction to seeing the Word of God the glorified Christ the Lord Jesus Christ in a glorified body expressing the Sevenfold glory of his person John saw him that day in a way that was so different from the last time it was so powerful and so beautiful - John that verse 17 gives us his reaction when I saw him I fell at his feet as if dead but he laid his right hand on me and said do not be afraid I am the first and the last and the everliving one I am living in the Eternity of the eternity I died but see I am alive forevermore and I possessed the keys of death and Hades the realm of the Dead we're talking about that place of Hell how powerful the expression of Jesus Christ the Living Word - John that day on the Isle of Patmos and John notice he didn't Google to see what his reaction was supposed to be he responded remember this is John who spent so much time when Jesus was alive in his earthly body John spent so much time with his head just leaned over on the chest on the shoulder of the Lord which I love that so much because if you notice in in the Gospel of John he often refers to himself as that disciple that Jesus loved someone said well wasn't that a prideful thing for John to say oh no oh no he had a revelation I would that you and I could have a similar revelation of his love for us when we get it we almost feel like he loves us more than anybody else I used to hear also old-timers in the church I grew up in say I just feel sometimes like he loves me more than he loves anybody else on the planet I understand that expression because that's how it can make you feel when you get in that atmosphere of his love when you get in that place so John he didn't just sit on the church pew that day with his hands folded no he didn't say well I'm not a Pentecostal so I can't raise my hands and worship the Lord no he didn't say I think I'll find another church to worship in because this one's getting too rowdy for me no he responded I mean he really reacted and responded to Christ the Living Word that was standing before him he fell over on his face like a dead man he was overwhelmed by the presence of the Living Word of God it made him want to worship it made him want to get as low as he possibly could John in his reaction is actually teaching us a little bit about what worship is supposed to be like worship is not supposed to be focused on what he's doing for us it's supposed to be focused on who he is it's not worship is not particularly to be about parading around and showing everybody just how good we are oh this seems to be a modern concept of worship oh I don't want to be critical but sometimes it looks a little bit more like a concert which I think is I think it's wonderful to go to a concert and hear wonderful God edifying music I do I think that's wonderful but it just doesn't feel to me sometimes like what real worship is supposed to be like in church or even in my personal life in fact I find that when I'm really moved to worship I shut everything else out anyway I don't even know what they're singing or I don't even know what what music I'm listening to because there's that realm there's that atmosphere that we get in where we're just dead we're just dead before him I remember a woman of God who wrote some beautiful inspirational books and she had a beautiful life as a missionary for many years to both China and later to Israel she wrote about worship she wrote about praise and she compared it to entering into the holy of Holy's we start in the outer court we move into that holy place but in that holy of holies that's worship you know praise goes on whether it's busyness and activity you know I'm a rowdy Pentecostal myself I like good praise clapping my hands and stomping my foot and getting excited about the Lord I know it a lot of people are opposed to that but they get really excited at the at the football game they get real excited at the baseball game or the or the boxing match but they they become different creatures in church when given an opportunity to worship the Lord then they're also reserved well why do they get so excited at the sporting event because they're passionate about it because they enjoy it because it's they're not out there on the field but but they almost begin to feel like they're the ones I've seen people act in the stands like they were out they're on the field and they'll say well look at us now look at who you're in the stand they're down on the field or people will come away my team won we won that match you didn't win it you're a fan watching you're an observer some some of you watching it on television why do you say that I'll tell you why because you feel connected you feel identified with that team you've got passion for them you're a true fan I want you to know that praise is a little bit like that you're identifying yourself with the life of Jesus Christ and you begin to feel a part of him you begin to feel a part of what's going on in the spiritual atmosphere and so praise can sometimes be a little noisy it can sometimes be a little rowdy the music can sometimes be a little faster than average but when you begin to enter into that place of glory see there's lots of anointing lots of spirit that can come in praise but when we enter into that Holy of Holies in that realm of deeper glory there's not a lot of noise I'm telling you you couldn't jump around and enjoy yourself nearly as much if at all in that realm of glory because when you enter into that complete divine presence of Jesus Christ like John did here in Revelation chapter one about the best you can do is fall on your face like a dead man knowing that you'd lay there just dead unless he raises you up and strengthens you to go on and live your life John said but he reached his hand and touched me and said do not be afraid I'm telling you if you have any sense of the Lord's comfort when you're afraid when you're in a trial when you're going through something very difficult and hard in your life if you can just get quiet come to him almost like a dead man I tell you what this may seem old-fashioned you can just laugh if it's too old-fashioned for you you might ought to just get down on your rug in your living room right on your face no one's watching you maybe just get down sometime beside your bed and just lay right flat on the floor and say I want to acknowledge that you are Lord of my life you are not just my hobby on Sunday you are my every day you are my everything you are the reason I live and unless you raise me up I just as well to stay here and lay on my face the rest of my life because I can't do anything without your touch anyway unless you touch me unless you anoint me unless you strengthen me and reveal yourself to me I'm useless I'm almost paralyzed I don't have the ability and myself to live the Christ life the Jesus life I tell you if God begins to hear things from you from the sincerity of your heart like that you may just find him showing up in real ways you may just find encounters with him that you never dreamed possible on a personal level and I'm not talking about a vivid imagination I'm talking about the reality of a visitation from the genuine Spirit of God it's not only possible it's life-changing and if you position yourself it's probable but we have to get still I love John's reaction I mean John was bold John was not a pushover he was a bold man he had already suffered a lot of things for the name of Jesus he had been twice wasn't it boiled in oil they had done everything to try to destroy him and stop him and put fear in him and even kill him and when they couldn't fry him like a like a french fry or you'd say across the United Kingdom like chips when they couldn't do that they just put him on an island where there were historians believe there were wild animals and other robbers at times had been put out there and they'd come back and found their bones they banished him there to die but if you know the rest of the story you'll know John didn't die on the Isle of Patmos that wasn't the end of his story it was the beginning of a greater chapter in his life but he was put there to die and oh my what God did for him and gave him a message that was to be preserved for for the end time the hour that we're living in right now and he had encountered the presence of God remember he saw the miracles he knew what the power of God was like but in this fullness you see he was seeing not only Jesus Christ in a way he had never seen him before and that's certainly true but he was being unveiled to John Jesus was being unveiled it's the apocalypsis it's that Greek word that speaks to us about the unveiling of Jesus Christ to see him more clearly than we have ever seen him before there's more to Jesus than our Sunday School lessons there's more to Jesus than than what most of us heard in in our traditional upbringing he's not just an entity or a person a million miles away of which we should walk around on planet Earth in constant fear of him you know ducking to make sure that he doesn't kill us we have oftentimes developed a a concept of God and we have not understood the oneness of Jesus and his father and we become afraid God now the fear of the Lord is a reverential fear but it's not a cowering paralyzing fear that keeps us from serving him but what if I told you that you can have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ knowing in the depth of who you are that he is unveiling himself and making himself real to you because of his great love what if I told you that that doesn't have to take place at the hand of a priest or even at the hand of a preacher but thank God for preachers you know God uses preachers he uses the foolishness of preaching to reveal much of who he is to us but that could never replace the joy and the experience of having a personal relationship with Jesus Christ well brother Shelly they don't teach that in my church or that's not how I was raised I didn't grow up that way with all due respect my friend then check the word check the Word of God and see what it says about what is possible when we abide in him and he abides in us see what Jesus said when he explained that he was one with his father and that he desired to have that same relationship with us that he has with his father oneness and union you know that's beyond fellowship it's even in a place that's beyond Communion and and friendship it's a place of oneness that's a big subject and maybe we'll talk about it another time the joy of of the journey toward becoming one with Jesus Christ let me read another portion of scripture to you before we we go too much farther Hebrews chapter 4 and verses 12 and 13 in the King James it says and I'm going to read a little bit of it so that you'll recognize it for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword I know you've heard the scripture before but I'm going to share it in the amplified for the word that God speaks is alive and full of power making it active operative energizing and effective now I I confess that's amplified it's it's it's a lot of words for one or two words in the King James but all it makes me glad it makes me glad and it's the truth because the word that God speaks is active it's not it's not stationary or stagnant static it moves it lives it transforms the hearts of men and women its operative its energizing and thanks be to God it is effective it if it produces it affects us and it causes beautiful effects in our life it changes us it is sharper than any two-edged sword penetrating to the dividing line of the breath of life soul and the immortal spirit and of joints and marrow of the deepest parts of our nature exposing and sifting and analyzing and judging the very thoughts and purposes of the heart did you know the Word of God was capable of doing all those things in your life as an individual or the said so the written record of God's Word tells us that the word this word quickened by the life-giving spirit is able to accomplish all of these things in her life and verse 13 not a creature exists that is concealed from his sight but all things are open and exposed naked and defenseless to the eyes of him whom we have to do that's a powerful word the Word of God and it's expressed beautifully here in these verses of Scripture I wanted to focus on verse 13 as we come to a close of our time today this part where it says open and exposed the new American Standard Version of the Bible takes verse 13 and it translates it this way open and laid bare in King James it says all things are naked and opened unto Him or unto his eyes but this word is an interesting word it's a Greek word and it means to seize by the throat or the neck to expose the gullet of a victim for killing wasn't that an interesting choice of words for the Apostle to use in writing his letter to the Hebrew believers it literally means to not hide your neck to go ahead and expose your neck so that the knife can be laid to your throat for death I don't know about you but that's a little disturbing but in a good way because this is the effectiveness of the word of God if we are willing in fact it it let me read this to you the words laid bare in verse 13 are from the Greek word trek Lizzio which literally means to seize and bend back the neck exposing the throat as with an animal that was being slaughtered or sacrificed this is why Paul would use such a word when speaking to the Jewish believers the Hebrew believers who had come to faith in Jesus as the Messiah because they were very familiar with the concept of animal sacrifice and so this is exactly what was what was being hinted at if not directly spoken the word is also used to describe action on the battlefield what's happening when we keep coming to the Word of God allowing the Word of God to to be effective in our lives praying praying to God Lord let your word change me transform me strengthen me empower me what we're really doing is exposing our nakedness to Christ or we are exposing our neck to him you know what we're saying we're saying I'm laying down my life I want you to use your word to examine every motive every intent of my heart that would keep me from fulfilling the reason of my birth if indeed I was born to serve the Lord I've told you that I believe that's the summary of why I was born is to serve the Lord then that would be my prayer Lord I expose my neck to you like a lamb for the slaughter not trying to hide anything from you in any of my nakedness any of my flaws I'm just asking that your word would come like the knife that it is it's sharp it's quick the verse verse 12 said that it would divide soul and spirit even to the marrow of the bone the Word of God discerns the secret thoughts and the intents of the heart and our prayer is Lord I submit I submit to the truth of your word the word of God both cuts sometimes corrects like a crushing hammer burns sometime like a consuming fire but don't you forget my friend the Word of God also heals and mends and puts things back together the spirit Word of God this word of God quickened made alive anointed unveiled to you in relationship can do all of those things it can restore anything that the enemy has stolen from you pray with me father thank you for your word thank you for giving us for preserving for us the Bible the written record of your word but thank you even more for coming to us by the Holy Ghost thank you for coming by your spirit and making your word live in the depth of who we are correcting us changing us sometimes cutting us sometimes operating on a surgery it feels like but thank you Lord also that your word heals renews restores builds us up and we just pray right now for every believer that your word would be this effective in their lives as they surrender more of themselves to you in this day in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen let the word of god work mightily you start right now god bless you thank you for watching us again we'll be back bye-bye [Music] [Applause] you
