[43:18] hall yesterday afternoon the air
[43:20] conditioner was
[43:22] running praise be to God
[43:29] the air conditioner man had many many
[43:32] struggles from the time he left us on
[43:34] Monday evening to the time he got back
[43:36] here yesterday but when he left here
[43:39] yesterday he was a happy man because it
[43:41] all went smoothly and and the unit was
[43:44] running when they left and when I left
[43:47] it was still above 80 de but it was just
[43:50] getting started so it it's going to take
[43:53] some time for it to get the temperature
[43:55] down but I'm thankful that it's there
[43:58] the Lord is providing for that might
[44:01] make mention to you that the Jerusalem

[44:28] faithful he has looked after us now for
[44:31] 20 plus years concerning those
[44:34] apartments in Jerusalem and we want to
[44:36] be faithful to what he's called us to
[44:39] there's a lot going on in Israel right
[44:41] now but I'm glad that the god of Israel
[44:43] is watching over them and he's watching
[44:46] over me he knows us he knows what our
[44:49] needs are and he knows how to take care
[44:52] of us when the economy looks bad you

[1:02:40] bones behold I will cause breath to
[1:02:45] enter into you and you shall live and I
[1:02:50] will lay Sinners upon
[1:02:52] you and will bring up flesh upon you
[1:02:56] and cover you with skin and put breath
[1:03:00] in you and you shall live and you shall
[1:03:03] know that I am the Lord so I prophesied
[1:03:08] as I was commanded and as I prophesied
[1:03:11] there was a noise Behold a shaking and
[1:03:15] the bones came together and this is the
[1:03:18] word of the Lord to you at New Hope this
[1:03:22] morning hear him now hear the Lord so as
[1:03:28] I prophesied there was a noise and
[1:03:32] behold a shaking and the bones came
[1:03:35] together here's the Lord
[1:03:37] bone somebody say bone to his bone his
[1:03:42] bone bone to his
[1:03:46] bone do you understand how important
[1:03:48] that is in that day and in this day that
[1:03:52] every bone find his bone
[1:03:55] you you you can't have a toe bone
[1:03:58] connected to an
[1:03:59] elbow right you you can't have a foot
[1:04:02] bone connected to a hip it's vitally
[1:04:07] important when God is rebuilding an army
[1:04:10] out of a valley of dry bones it's
[1:04:14] vitally important that every bone find
[1:04:18] his
[1:04:19] bone I am convinced this morning sitting
[1:04:23] here that God is calling you you to find
[1:04:27] your
[1:04:28] bone every gift has a compliment there
[1:04:33] is a complimentary gift for every gift
[1:04:37] that God places in your life the Bible
[1:04:40] said two are
[1:04:43] stronger than one and a three-fold chord
[1:04:48] is not easily broken for all my life God
[1:04:52] has dealt with me about a Synergy I I
[1:04:56] for years I didn't have a
[1:04:59] word I didn't have a word to explain it
[1:05:02] I just stumbled to explain it but now
[1:05:06] there there there came a word
[1:05:09] Synergy it's like
[1:05:11] Symphony it's the gathering together
[1:05:14] every bone look this way every bone
[1:05:18] finding his
[1:05:21] bone right you've got to be where God
[1:05:24] has planted you to be
[1:05:26] and you've got to be connected to who
[1:05:29] God has connected you to and you got to
[1:05:31] know who you've got to know who because
[1:05:35] when you when you come together how can
[1:05:38] two walk together except they be
[1:05:43] agreed and we know what happens when we
[1:05:46] join together Faith to
[1:05:48] Faith call of God to call of God sir and
[1:05:52] it matters it matters what you believe
[1:05:56] it matters where you worship it matters
[1:05:59] who you're in alignment with and I heard
[1:06:02] the spirit of the Lord saying this
[1:06:05] morning that I am releasing a sound to
[1:06:09] cause every bone to find his bone and I
[1:06:14] quickly looked at the scripture bone to
[1:06:18] find his bone Lord we want to know
[1:06:21] today where our bone is we want to know
[1:06:26] what you have connected us to and who
[1:06:29] you have connected us with we want to
[1:06:32] lay our life down beside others who have
[1:06:37] a likeminded faith we want to we want to
[1:06:41] surrender our gift a and walk with those
[1:06:45] who are who are gifted alike who are
[1:06:49] called Alik every Christian is not
[1:06:51] called to the same battle to the same
[1:06:55] work
[1:06:56] and Lord we want to know we can't go out
[1:06:58] to battle brother we can't go out to
[1:07:01] battle if we don't know who has our
[1:07:04] back we don't want to be in the Foxhole
[1:07:08] we don't want to be in the trenches with
[1:07:10] somebody who's trying to sell us
[1:07:14] out we want to be in the battle with
[1:07:17] somebody who's got our common
[1:07:21] interest our common vision is laid upon
[1:07:25] him
[1:07:26] the same way it was laid upon
[1:07:28] us and and this the only way we can it's
[1:07:32] the only way we can walk together yes if
[1:07:36] you don't you'll have one pulling one
[1:07:38] way one Ox going that way and another Ox
[1:07:41] going that way Lord bind us together
[1:07:44] today in the name of Jesus Christ all
[1:07:47] over this house and throughout the
[1:07:50] stream Lord let that anointing come that
[1:07:54] will help us some of you some of you
[1:07:57] real soft some of you are going to
[1:08:00] discover that you're already walking
[1:08:03] with your
[1:08:04] bone but you haven't acknowledged it you
[1:08:08] haven't really recognized that God has
[1:08:11] placed you where he has placed you in a
[1:08:14] friendship in a relationship in a church
[1:08:17] body I'm not just talking about the
[1:08:18] church body I believe that's the army
[1:08:21] that God's raising up but I'm talking
[1:08:23] about even in relationship boyfriend to
[1:08:26] girlfriend I tell you bone better find
[1:08:29] his
[1:08:30] bone you better find who you belong to
[1:08:34] because if you don't they'll take you
[1:08:35] out of the purposes of God for your life
[1:08:40] and nobody will pay the price but you
[1:08:43] that's right see everybody doesn't get
[1:08:45] their
[1:08:46] somebody everybody doesn't get the one
[1:08:49] that God called them to have do you
[1:08:51] understand that that's true because some
[1:08:53] people won't find their bone
[1:08:56] they're looking for something else
[1:08:58] they're not looking for a a a person who
[1:09:01] their gifting and their calling will
[1:09:05] compliment I don't know how to say it
[1:09:08] better join together both shoulders to
[1:09:12] the plow in marriage in
[1:09:15] friendship in in family
[1:09:18] relations most importantly in a church
[1:09:22] body I want you to know if one can put a
[1:09:25] th000 to
[1:09:28] flight two can put 10,000 to
[1:09:31] flight that that's God's
[1:09:34] mathematics seems to me like 1,000 and
[1:09:37] 1,000 would be 2,000 but God said when
[1:09:41] you're working with the one I've called
[1:09:43] you to be
[1:09:44] with when you're covenanted with the
[1:09:47] right person with the right thing then 1
[1:09:50] + one doesn't make two on it makes 10
[1:09:56] 10,000 that's God's economics how many
[1:09:59] of you are glad you've discovered his
[1:10:01] economics I want you to sincerely pray
[1:10:04] right now Lord help me
[1:10:06] discover help me discover my
[1:10:09] bone help me find who you have called me
[1:10:13] where you have called me to
[1:10:19] walk I'll just say who your pastor is
[1:10:23] matters it matters yes L May God help
[1:10:27] you to know who your pastor is that's
[1:10:31] may God help you to know where you're to
[1:10:34] be and what you are to be used
[1:10:38] for God said I'm going to take some
[1:10:40] followers and make them
[1:10:43] leaders I'm going to take
[1:10:45] chameleons who have just tried to blend
[1:10:48] in to their environment and I'm going to
[1:10:50] make them somebody I'm going to make
[1:10:52] them something that is not dependent on
[1:10:55] their environment but I'm going to let
[1:10:57] them be I'm going to loose them and let
[1:11:00] them be what I have created them to be
[1:11:04] what I have called them to be and
[1:11:07] they're not going to have to try to
[1:11:08] change their
[1:11:10] colors when they're with a different
[1:11:12] group of people they're going to be have
[1:11:14] they're going to have Liberty and
[1:11:16] freedom to be who they are Lord right
[1:11:19] now we ask you to settle this thing in
[1:11:22] our
[1:11:23] heart settle this thing in our heart
[1:11:27] because when we know who our bone is and
[1:11:31] and what our Valley is where our place
[1:11:34] is
[1:11:36] spiritually we don't ever have to
[1:11:38] compete with one another we don't ever
[1:11:40] have to be jealous over one another we
[1:11:43] don't ever have to resent one another
[1:11:46] for how each other is being used in the
[1:11:49] body because we understand that in a
[1:11:53] body there are many members yes and
[1:11:56] they're not all of the
[1:11:58] same they're not all the same bone
[1:12:01] that's
[1:12:05] right some bones have a better
[1:12:08] reputation than others they just seem
[1:12:10] more important but the reality is every
[1:12:15] bone in the body is vitally
[1:12:19] important for the full function of that
[1:12:23] body amen
[1:12:25] and you've got to have it you've got to
[1:12:27] have it do you understand how it throws
[1:12:30] everything out of balance if the toes
[1:12:33] are
[1:12:34] removed did you know people have to
[1:12:36] learn to walk yes without doing
[1:12:40] this if they lose
[1:12:42] toes they don't look like much I think
[1:12:46] they're kind of
[1:12:47] ugly but we need them they keep us in
[1:12:51] the right
[1:12:52] balance may God help us May if you
[1:12:56] discover that you're a toe don't resent
[1:12:59] it say Lord thank you that somebody can
[1:13:02] be placed in the body to help bring the
[1:13:05] balance you hear
[1:13:07] him you hear
[1:13:10] him that's where we are in this

[1:13:16] a
[1:13:17] surge of the spirit of God we're singing
[1:13:20] about the greatness of our God and all
[1:13:23] of a sudden I could see Ezekiel calling
[1:13:27] on the Wind of the spirit to come and
[1:13:31] breathe because once the bone Finds Its
[1:13:34] bone sinu can
[1:13:37] [Music]
[1:13:38] come organs can come and then guess what
[1:13:43] happens there's got to be skin to cover

[1:19:48] of things hang in my closet and in my
[1:19:50] drawers that are older than brother
[1:19:52] Shane minko when I saw the year of his

[1:19:57] been busy in these short years on the
[1:20:00] earth he's not nearly as old as some of
[1:20:03] us uh Friday would have been my dear

[1:20:12] steady um Confidant and and so much more

[1:20:28] wishing your loved one a happy birthday
[1:20:30] In Heaven There Are No birthdays there

[1:20:46] just one day it's that day that's the
[1:20:50] day it is one Eternal day never ends
[1:20:53] some of you seem dis

[1:20:59] rejoicing he he doesn't even know he
[1:21:02] won't know that it was his birthday he's
[1:21:05] already entered into the great eternity
[1:21:07] of God and then this coming weekend
[1:21:10] August 3rd and 4th Saturday night and
[1:21:12] Sunday are our fellowship meetings we're
[1:21:15] looking forward to whatever the Lord has
[1:21:17] the Lord will be with us he's with us
[1:21:19] today and then camp meeting this year
[1:21:22] again October 15th
[1:21:24] uh through the
[1:21:26] 20th and our next fellowship meeting
[1:21:29] will be December 6th and 7th so the camp
[1:21:33] meeting although it's not the first
[1:21:34] weekend of October will serve as our
[1:21:38] fellowship meeting for October but we'll
[1:21:41] get back to the first weekend in
[1:21:43] December if some of you discovered that
[1:21:46] you were uh signed out of the app and
[1:21:50] had to resign in that's my fault I did
[1:21:52] it I apologize to you you um I didn't
[1:21:56] realize when I merged some of your many
[1:22:03] accounts I discovered that some people
[1:22:06] change email addresses more often than
[1:22:09] others change
[1:22:11] socks and some of you had so many
[1:22:14] different accounts and so many different
[1:22:16] emails in the system that you're you
[1:22:19] were clogging up the system so we merged
[1:22:22] just it it just had to make sure was you
[1:22:24] and go through a few thing we merged and
[1:22:27] that might have kicked some of you out
[1:22:29] of the app let me encourage you to get
[1:22:31] back in log back in because it's not
[1:22:35] just prayer requests sometimes it's
[1:22:37] inspiration that drops on anybody in the
[1:22:40] body and they share it and it keeps us
[1:22:43] going and sometimes it becomes an
[1:22:46] SOS so all of you who think you're too
[1:22:49] busy to have the app
[1:22:54] I don't know what you're so busy with
[1:22:57] that you wouldn't want to pray for one
[1:22:59] another and that you wouldn't want to
[1:23:01] take the spiritual temperature of the
[1:23:03] bone that you're connected to in this
[1:23:05] hour so if you accidentally turned off
[1:23:09] the notifications it's so easy to
[1:23:11] accidentally do I encourage you to go
[1:23:14] back and turn them on you just go up to
[1:23:17] the little bell at the top and press it
[1:23:18] again and you'll get your notifications
[1:23:21] back uh because for now we're putting it
[1:23:24] in both places the Facebook group we do
[1:23:27] that because only the local group is is
[1:23:29] connected to the messenging uh uh system
[1:23:32] in the app but we sometimes we want you
[1:23:35] to know while I was in Salt Lake City
[1:23:38] there were a couple of SOS that were
[1:23:40] urgent and we wanted to make the people
[1:23:44] aware that there is a raging battle
[1:23:47] going on in that other realm and when
[1:23:50] there is it means Victory is is on the
[1:23:55] Horizon and and so you don't want to be
[1:23:58] unaware of what's going on and you don't
[1:24:00] want to be slacked in a time that you're
[1:24:03] supposed to be pushing you want to be
[1:24:04] pushing and if God should ever allow us
[1:24:07] a time to Coast I think coasting days
[1:24:10] are over but if he should give us a
[1:24:12] reprieve and let us Coast well you want
[1:24:14] to know you can Coast a little bit and
[1:24:17] so stay connected to the ministry if you
[1:24:20] possibly can because one day I notice I
[1:24:24] know notic that some people who never
[1:24:26] say I'm praying never put praying hands
[1:24:29] NE so easy to put praying hands it's
[1:24:31] harder to actually pray than it is to
[1:24:34] say I'm
[1:24:36] praying amen but I notice that people
[1:24:38] who never encourage anyone else who
[1:24:40] never say I'm praying for you if you get
[1:24:42] in a bind I've seen some of you come out
[1:24:45] of the woodwork come where I don't know
[1:24:47] where you've been hiding in the woods
[1:24:49] somewhere I see you show up all of a
[1:24:51] sudden to tell us that you've got a
[1:24:53] prayer request that you'd like for us to
[1:24:54] pray about let may I just ask you
[1:24:56] without making you feel too bad how fair
[1:24:59] is
[1:25:00] that we all need to know hey that
[1:25:04] somebody's fighting with us oh is it
[1:25:07] going to be that kind of a Sunday it's
[1:25:10] just a truth it's just a truth amen
[1:25:14] would you turn with me today to Matthew
[1:25:18] that is the first of the four
[1:25:21] gospels I'd like to read in Matthew chap
[1:25:26] 24: 10- 12 while you're turning there
[1:25:30] I'd like to give thanks again publicly
[1:25:33] for the Lord returning our bag to us it
[1:25:36] wasn't a large bag it was only almost
[1:25:39] what you would call a carry-on siiz bag
[1:25:42] but but the value of the things that
[1:25:45] were in that bag would have been $4,000
[1:25:48] or more so we certainly wanted to get it
[1:25:52] back um I I don't want to my wife but
[1:25:55] she uses a CPAP machine not because
[1:25:57] she's overweight some people think
[1:25:59] that's the only cause of sleep apnea but
[1:26:02] uh hers has to do with a broken nose
[1:26:05] from a long time ago she wakes up with a
[1:26:08] headache if she doesn't use it she's
[1:26:10] been using it for years it's not
[1:26:12] something we've ever felt like we had to
[1:26:14] announce um because it's so often
[1:26:17] associated with snoring that would you
[1:26:19] don't want to talk about things like
[1:26:21] that but she needed it because she was
[1:26:23] waking up with headaches in fact one
[1:26:25] morning her vision was leaving uh
[1:26:28] because of something like a migraine
[1:26:30] coming on so we're so thankful that God
[1:26:33] you prayed and prayed and prayed you
[1:26:35] were probably tired of praying about it
[1:26:37] but thank you for pressing through and
[1:26:40] there are people who will never see
[1:26:41] their bags with what's going on right
[1:26:44] now people are overseas and their bags
[1:26:47] are somewhere else this is a big big
[1:26:49] mess the more dependent we become on on
[1:26:53] servers and Tech technology the more
[1:26:55] crippled we are when something goes
[1:26:57] wrong and it will it certainly will so
[1:27:01] thank you for praying uh I'm going to
[1:27:03] ask again that you give me the best of
[1:27:06] your attention this morning and I'll try
[1:27:08] to obey the Lord Matthew 24:10 and then
[1:27:12] shall many be
[1:27:14] offended oh dear what day is that it's
[1:27:19] got to be now too doesn't it it may have
[1:27:22] applied to other ages but there's never
[1:27:25] been an age like the woke age where
[1:27:29] everybody is offended about
[1:27:32] something many shall be offended and
[1:27:35] shall betray one another this is Jesus
[1:27:39] talking red letter and
[1:27:43] shall hate one another this is an age of
[1:27:47] rage and hate right I'm mindful sometime
[1:27:52] in public boy when I was flying home
[1:27:55] with my wife on Monday I knew people's
[1:27:57] nerves were pressed you could feel it in
[1:28:00] the air and I wanted to tiptoe I didn't
[1:28:03] want to stir anybody up because people
[1:28:06] had had their limit and when you're that
[1:28:09] way it's a it's just an opportunity
[1:28:12] presents itself to just rage and I knew
[1:28:15] that some I said honey look around these
[1:28:17] people's fuses are shorter than they
[1:28:19] have ever been before we we've got to
[1:28:22] pray that we get home safe L without
[1:28:25] watching someone drug off an airplane I
[1:28:28] mean you could feel it in the atmosphere
[1:28:31] so much rage so much hate and many false
[1:28:34] prophets shall rise and shall deceive
[1:28:38] many and because iniquity shall abound
[1:28:43] the love of many shall what wax wax cold
[1:28:48] so it's absolutely the truth there will
[1:28:51] be the false the false will always rise
[1:28:56] many will be deceived the Bible tells us
[1:28:59] it will be so serious that even the
[1:29:04] elect would be
[1:29:06] deceived
[1:29:08] if if it were
[1:29:13] possible we're not adding to the
[1:29:15] scripture are we we're getting it all in
[1:29:18] if it were possible so when someone
[1:29:23] decides that they have been deceived in
[1:29:26] the truth then you must understand the
[1:29:29] position that they're in they are taking
[1:29:33] themselves out of the numbered
[1:29:36] elect because the elect may get off they
[1:29:40] may slide they may slip brother brandom
[1:29:45] said they may look
[1:29:47] backslid but they will never that elect
[1:29:50] number never somebody say never be
[1:29:54] deceived it's not even possible for them
[1:29:56] to be deceived that ought not to make
[1:29:58] you
[1:29:58] strut that ought to make you want to
[1:30:00] keep crawling back to God if you believe
[1:30:03] that say Amen may God add his Blessing
[1:30:06] to the reading of his word you may be
[1:30:08] seated thank you for remembering if all
[1:30:11] possible to give me the attention that
[1:30:13] you can because in a few moments I'm
[1:30:15] going to take a I'm I'm going to turn
[1:30:18] Corners here and I'm going to go off in
[1:30:21] a different direction and you're going
[1:30:22] to think where where is he
[1:30:25] going why is he bringing that in have
[1:30:28] you ever heard somebody bring something
[1:30:30] in and you wondered what in the world
[1:30:32] did that have to do with anything else
[1:30:34] that was said sometimes it's just doing
[1:30:36] our best to follow the mind of the
[1:30:40] Spirit uh we were taught that if you
[1:30:42] have a question you can sit there in the
[1:30:45] seat and pull on the gift and uh if that
[1:30:49] man has a a genuine gift to minister the
[1:30:52] word that you can pull toward you with
[1:30:55] your with your faith Hall your faith
[1:30:58] pool and and he might just go way off
[1:31:00] over there somewhere and start talking
[1:31:02] about something that that you you knew
[1:31:05] it had to be for you and you took it and
[1:31:08] you claimed it for yourself I want you
[1:31:11] to understand this message it'll end up
[1:31:14] being a few Services of a series and I
[1:31:16] want to call it this morning returning
[1:31:19] to your first love it's vitally
[1:31:23] important that that we beat our way back
[1:31:26] to our first
[1:31:27] love and if he's never been I'm
[1:31:30] convinced I hope this doesn't sound so
[1:31:33] very judgmental but I'm convinced that
[1:31:36] some people have followed along as a
[1:31:39] part of the church at large but have
[1:31:42] never fallen in love with
[1:31:45] Jesus in order just to fall in love with
[1:31:49] him you have to see your depravity you
[1:31:52] have to see how low you were and because
[1:31:56] we certainly don't like to look to where
[1:31:58] we were we like to keep our hearts and
[1:32:01] Minds planted on what is to come uh but
[1:32:05] we have to sometime look back and
[1:32:07] remember how low we were when he found
[1:32:10] us and when you remember what gutter you
[1:32:13] were laying in when Jesus passed by your
[1:32:16] way it'll cause you to love him and and
[1:32:20] then there are those who love him
[1:32:22] because they feel like he gave them a a
[1:32:24] a get out of hell a pass uh like playing
[1:32:28] Monopoly you know uh you know uh go to
[1:32:32] jail do not pass gold do not collect and
[1:32:36] and that's what they're looking for a a
[1:32:38] card that Springs you out of jail and so
[1:32:42] they say well I love the Lord because he
[1:32:44] saved me from hell that's not enough uh
[1:32:47] for the for the elect of God hell was
[1:32:50] never yours it was never created for you
[1:32:53] you weren't weren't ever really going
[1:32:57] there you're just walking down the wrong
[1:33:00] road but but your home was never built
[1:33:03] for you in hell you you even the
[1:33:07] psalmist said though I make my bed in
[1:33:09] hell though I choose to hide in hell it
[1:33:12] never was my my place of dwelling God
[1:33:15] has a home for you that is of Eternity
[1:33:18] and uh that's where you are always going
[1:33:20] to be eventually but you had to
[1:33:23] recognize
[1:33:24] your sinful nature your Fallen condition
[1:33:27] and you had to come to the Lord but many
[1:33:30] people follow Christianity attend church
[1:33:34] Faithfully pay their tithe and have
[1:33:37] never fallen in love with
[1:33:41] Jesus they've never spend enough time
[1:33:44] with him because you've got to subtract
[1:33:47] the time you spend in
[1:33:49] church you've got to subtract that
[1:33:52] that's not what it really means to spend
[1:33:54] time with him if you're spending time
[1:33:57] with him it's not a hundred other people
[1:34:00] and you and him if you're really
[1:34:02] fellowshipping with him it generally is
[1:34:05] you and him and to those Christians who
[1:34:08] have never taken the time for it to be
[1:34:11] you and him him and you however you want
[1:34:14] to say it you've missed out on what A
[1:34:17] Love Affair this serving God really is
[1:34:21] we don't just love him because he first
[1:34:23] loved us does we don't just love him
[1:34:25] because he saved us from hell we don't
[1:34:28] love him because of what his hand does
[1:34:31] on our behalf we've got to learn to love
[1:34:34] him for who he is for his very nature
[1:34:38] for his very character for his very
[1:34:42] attributes and if you don't see God as
[1:34:44] Sovereign you'll never fall in love with
[1:34:47] him because you'll always blame him for
[1:34:50] bad things that happen in your life but
[1:34:52] once you get revelation of his
[1:34:55] sovereignty you can really fall in love
[1:34:58] with him because you discover that even
[1:35:00] if you get on a boat going in the wrong
[1:35:05] direction that God knows how to meet you
[1:35:08] on the other
[1:35:10] end he knows how can you tell I've been
[1:35:13] studying Jonah all week long he I have
[1:35:16] but I'm not going to preach on Jonah
[1:35:18] today but I've been studying him all
[1:35:20] week long because I'm trying to answer
[1:35:23] answer the age-old question was Jonah
[1:35:26] backslid or not it's a big big question
[1:35:30] and I'm going to preach that for you
[1:35:32] sometime in the near future backslid or
[1:35:34] not backslid because for many many years
[1:35:38] brother brandham preached emphatically
[1:35:41] that Jonah was backslid and then all of
[1:35:43] a sudden around 58 or 59 I think it was
[1:35:47] he read somewhere where he might not
[1:35:49] actually have been backslid and from
[1:35:52] then on he said I read this and he said
[1:35:54] I like the way it sounded and from then
[1:35:57] on he began to preach it just a little
[1:35:58] bit different he got off he got out of
[1:36:02] God's plan he got out of God's
[1:36:06] will but he didn't have to start the
[1:36:08] journey all
[1:36:09] over the fish did part of the
[1:36:13] work when he got spit out he was better
[1:36:16] prepared and in a better location to get
[1:36:20] to where he had to go
[1:36:23] woo that's a godall
[1:36:26] man that's a god- calleded woman make a
[1:36:30] bad choice and God use the bad
[1:36:34] choice get in God's permissive will and
[1:36:38] God use permissive will to get you
[1:36:41] closer to perfect will that's the
[1:36:44] sovereignty of God that's why I love him
[1:36:47] that's why I love him so much he's just
[1:36:50] everything he he he never ever makes a
[1:36:54] mistake so I'll preach on that but but
[1:36:57] not this morning but the reality is that
[1:37:01] uh Jonah he he he did he started out to
[1:37:06] he wanted to obey God he was a true
[1:37:08] prophet of God he loved God he he was a
[1:37:12] head and shoulders Above the
[1:37:15] Rest but he just simply didn't want to
[1:37:17] go to
[1:37:20] Nineveh and there may be multiple
[1:37:23] reasons I'm again I'm not going to but
[1:37:25] I'm trying to anyway aren't
[1:37:27] I there may be multiple reasons why I
[1:37:30] didn't want to go but that don't make it
[1:37:34] right I don't always get to go where I
[1:37:37] want to go and I don't you know what I
[1:37:40] mean and sometimes we're put where we
[1:37:43] would rather not be I remember brother
[1:37:47] skipworth who worked so hard for so many
[1:37:50] years on this Campground fing in every
[1:37:54] mud
[1:37:55] hole back breaking work no heavy
[1:37:59] equipment a shovel dirt a five gallon
[1:38:04] bucket of gravel and when the early days
[1:38:08] were and we were ter trying to clean up
[1:38:10] this land so that we could even do
[1:38:12] anything with it he had hats he was a
[1:38:15] cap guy and his prized hat his favorite
[1:38:20] hat fell off of his head and into one of
[1:38:23] them mud
[1:38:24] puddles and it turned it
[1:38:29] red and a man who rarely
[1:38:32] ever talked above a whisper he got right
[1:38:36] aggravated and he said I hate this red
[1:38:41] mud you see they didn't have it where he
[1:38:44] was from in in uh over that way in
[1:38:47] Elmore County just over here in Lee
[1:38:50] County well I don't like it either
[1:38:52] there's a lot of things things I don't
[1:38:54] like about where God put me but I
[1:38:58] understand that I don't always get the
[1:38:59] choice I've got to be at the right place
[1:39:02] at the right time come on because I'm
[1:39:06] not born here to do my will I'm here to
[1:39:08] do his will you need to understand that
[1:39:11] folks it's not just preachers that are
[1:39:14] born for a
[1:39:15] purpose there's amen that are born for a
[1:39:18] purpose musicians are born singers and
[1:39:22] all of those who who serve the way this
[1:39:26] body serves you you are you are
[1:39:29] positioned for a purpose for a reason we
[1:39:32] are in that very easily offendable age
[1:39:37] many be offended Matthew 2410 and shall
[1:39:41] betray one another because of their
[1:39:43] offense they shall sell one another out
[1:39:46] you can say it that way you know uh it's
[1:39:50] a truth we saw it in covid and we'll see
[1:39:52] it even in Greater ways as we go along
[1:39:56] uh uh some neighbors see too many cars
[1:39:58] at your house and call you in and Report
[1:40:01] you somebody find out we were having
[1:40:03] Church during the Mandate and and call
[1:40:06] in and report US these kinds of things
[1:40:09] will happen and we won't just be
[1:40:11] betrayed by our neighbor or by a
[1:40:14] stranger but but we can get under a
[1:40:17] spirit of
[1:40:19] offense and we can begin to to be
[1:40:22] offended with one another to such an
[1:40:24] extent that we begin to betray each
[1:40:27] other it's part of the spirit of the age
[1:40:30] that we're living in and when offense is
[1:40:34] not dealt with it it graduates to
[1:40:37] betrayal and when betrayal is not dealt
[1:40:40] with it gravitates toward
[1:40:43] hatred come on now and that's where
[1:40:47] we're living right now there is such a
[1:40:51] rage uh in in the in the world we saw
[1:40:54] the the great protests that were taking
[1:40:57] place this week simply because prime
[1:41:00] minister Netanyahu is here speaking up
[1:41:04] he brought with him uh families of of
[1:41:09] those who have hostages he brought a
[1:41:12] former hostage with him to stand with
[1:41:15] him as he addressed Congress several
[1:41:19] soldiers who uh even had missing body
[1:41:22] parts because of this war that goes on
[1:41:25] in Gaza all the while there were many uh
[1:41:29] defacing the the the city of Washington
[1:41:33] down at the at the at the rail station
[1:41:36] I've been there I ate lunch there with
[1:41:38] my wife when we were in Washington
[1:41:40] lobbying for Israel we ate lunch there
[1:41:44] and they they climb up the monument and
[1:41:46] they paint these uh triangles of red and
[1:41:50] they say uh Hamas is coming for you
[1:41:53] they're not
[1:41:55] kidding they're not
[1:41:57] kidding there there are many of them who
[1:42:00] have no clue what they're
[1:42:02] doing you just pull one aside and
[1:42:04] interview them and listen at the dumb
[1:42:06] answers they give you'll know they don't
[1:42:08] even know why they hate but among them
[1:42:11] this is where we have to pray among them
[1:42:14] there are those who very much
[1:42:17] desire very much desire to destroy not
[1:42:20] only the Jewish state but they desire to
[1:42:23] bring down the greatest nation on the
[1:42:25] face of the Earth the one you and I are
[1:42:27] blessed to live in so it's an hour to
[1:42:30] stay on our prayer bones and it's an
[1:42:33] hour to make sure that we are not so
[1:42:36] easily offended the Bible tells us great
[1:42:39] peace have they which love the laws of
[1:42:42] God and
[1:42:46] nothing nothing shall by any means
[1:42:48] offend them I want to become
[1:42:51] unoffendable hello I'd like that and and
[1:42:55] because
[1:42:56] iniquity iniquity a little different
[1:42:59] than just sin unbelief iniquity is a
[1:43:02] little different iniquity represents
[1:43:06] something that has not been dealt with
[1:43:10] generationally do you understand what I
[1:43:12] mean by that that that that
[1:43:15] tendency that
[1:43:18] predisposition that falls on another
[1:43:21] generation and if if they don't deal
[1:43:24] with that stronghold of iniquity it it
[1:43:28] waves over it rolls over and Cascades
[1:43:32] down on the Next Generation and the Next
[1:43:36] Generation uh personally in my family
[1:43:39] line you know it was a spirit of lust
[1:43:42] and
[1:43:43] unfaithfulness and it had to be broken
[1:43:47] or it would have ruined my life my
[1:43:49] children's life my grandchildren's life
[1:43:52] it ruined my father's life it ruined my
[1:43:55] grandfather's life it ruined my
[1:43:58] great-grandfather's wife and by how many
[1:44:00] wives my great great grandfather had I
[1:44:03] think something was a m with him as well
[1:44:06] that is Iniquity it is a spirit of
[1:44:09] unbelief that rolls down from generation
[1:44:12] to generation uh we find it uh outlined
[1:44:16] for us in the Old Testament and and you
[1:44:19] know the the analogy of the grapes and
[1:44:22] setting the teeth on edge and we
[1:44:25] understand some of these things that
[1:44:26] come and America has its own share of
[1:44:30] iniquity that rolls down from generation
[1:44:33] to generation a wild spirit that gets on
[1:44:36] people because iniquity shall abound
[1:44:40] generational sin that just keeps ruling
[1:44:43] the generations how many of you would
[1:44:45] like to think that you have power by the
[1:44:48] blood of Jesus to cut it off so that
[1:44:51] whatever you've had to fight whatever
[1:44:53] you've had to deal with how many of you
[1:44:55] love your children enough you'd like to
[1:44:57] think they would
[1:44:59] never have to deal with that kind of a
[1:45:02] predisposition toward any form of
[1:45:06] addiction or even something as simple is
[1:45:09] jealousy it can run through generations
[1:45:12] and it will continue to do that until
[1:45:15] somebody's willing to stand up and say
[1:45:17] I'm
[1:45:18] guilty I'm guilty I'm
[1:45:21] wrong and I did it I'm not blaming it on
[1:45:26] my dad I'm not blaming it on my granddad
[1:45:28] I agreed with it I'm the one responsible
[1:45:33] now blood of Jesus grace of God come and
[1:45:37] set me right break every Fetter and
[1:45:40] every yoke I tell you if you don't get
[1:45:43] filled up when the unclean Spirit goes
[1:45:46] out he'll find some
[1:45:48] more he'll come in and the state of that
[1:45:51] man will be worse in the end than it was
[1:45:54] in the beginning isn't that what the
[1:45:56] Bible said and because iniquity shall
[1:45:59] abound would you read the last phrase
[1:46:01] for me love
[1:46:04] of the love of many shall wax cold now
[1:46:08] you remember brother brandham uh
[1:46:11] differentiating between the loves in the
[1:46:14] Greek New Testament he was not a scholar
[1:46:17] he was not not really he barely knew how
[1:46:21] to study the the Greek but he had people
[1:46:24] in his life that he could talk to about
[1:46:27] and would help and and uh underline
[1:46:30] different things in books and let him
[1:46:32] read and I appreciate his desire to to
[1:46:36] understand there were things he didn't
[1:46:37] grasp but I'm so thankful for the things
[1:46:40] that he did grasp and he talked to us
[1:46:43] about the different kinds of love agapo
[1:46:46] agapo love which is a noun agape love uh
[1:46:49] which is the verb form and you'll hear
[1:46:51] them both used in interchangeably in the
[1:46:54] message and and among the people even
[1:46:56] and fileo love which is a a human kind
[1:46:59] of love uh what kind of love do you
[1:47:02] think is mentioned here is it a human
[1:47:05] love a fileo love a relational love or
[1:47:09] would you think that it would be an
[1:47:11] agape love a Divine love and it says and
[1:47:15] because iniquity shall abound the love
[1:47:17] of many shall wax cold would you think
[1:47:19] that would be a relational love a fileo
[1:47:22] Love or would you think that is going to
[1:47:24] be an Agape or agapo love let me hear
[1:47:26] you guess just guess well you're
[1:47:29] absolutely right uh I wouldn't have
[1:47:32] guessed just standing back and looking
[1:47:34] at it I would have thought that in
[1:47:36] context the scripture would be talking
[1:47:39] about uh people losing their love for
[1:47:42] one another and that would be on on the
[1:47:45] level of a fileo love but what we forget
[1:47:48] about Agape or agapo love is that it is
[1:47:51] not only the love that God has loved us
[1:47:54] with Divine agape love or agapo love but
[1:47:58] it's also the love wherewith we as
[1:48:02] Believers love one another do you
[1:48:06] understand it both comes down to us from
[1:48:10] above and it goes out from us to others
[1:48:15] so this is definitely agape love and it
[1:48:20] says because iniquity is abounding the
[1:48:23] love the Agape of many shall shall do
[1:48:27] what shall wax cold did I give you that
[1:48:31] word it it's suko in the Greek suko and
[1:48:36] it means to breathe it's the Greek form
[1:48:39] of breathing to breathe to cool to be
[1:48:43] cooled to become cold and or dry the the
[1:48:49] Jesus is saying and those who Translate
[1:48:53] his words to us are saying something
[1:48:58] because iniquity is abounding around us
[1:49:02] because generational sins are taking
[1:49:05] over the age that we live in it's like
[1:49:10] something has breathed cool air frigid
[1:49:15] air on our love and we are no longer
[1:49:19] capable of loving one another the way we
[1:49:22] should the way that we have been loved
[1:49:25] because the spiritual temperature has
[1:49:28] been so affected in the atmosphere of
[1:49:32] This World by iniquity iniquity has
[1:49:36] taken such a stronghold in our land that
[1:49:40] it's like the enemy himself has breathed
[1:49:44] cool air and it has dried out our love
[1:49:49] it has chilled or made our love be
[1:49:52] almost Frozen and when love is frozen it
[1:49:56] can't be given it can't be shared it
[1:49:59] becomes solid it becomes dry it's no
[1:50:02] longer exchangeable how many of you know
[1:50:05] we don't only want to receive his agape
[1:50:07] love but we want to exchange it we want
[1:50:10] to share it we want it to flow through
[1:50:13] us to the brothers first to the
[1:50:16] household of faith first but also to a
[1:50:19] world that's dying and going to a
[1:50:22] Devil's hell we shouldn't be surprised
[1:50:26] when Sinners
[1:50:29] sin we shouldn't be surprised when the
[1:50:32] world celebrates
[1:50:35] iniquity we shouldn't be surprised when
[1:50:38] the world mocks
[1:50:41] Christianity mocks the Lord's Supper
[1:50:44] puts this Pagan goddess uh of of of
[1:50:50] sexuality uh and display blazs it in the
[1:50:54] opening ceremonies of the Olympics this
[1:50:57] uh
[1:50:58] overweight homosexual man nearly naked
[1:51:02] painted blue with a Vine wrapped around
[1:51:05] his you know whats and uh that is the
[1:51:09] celebration and when they ask the the
[1:51:12] sad little Frenchman why he came up with
[1:51:15] something so stupid his answer was my
[1:51:19] message is inclusion there's nothing in
[1:51:22] inclusive about that I don't want to be
[1:51:25] included in that I don't want to be a
[1:51:28] part of that that is the spirit of the
[1:51:32] age but I'm not I'm not particularly
[1:51:35] offended by it either because I expect
[1:51:39] it don't be shocked by it it's there as
[1:51:43] a shock factor it's there to shock you
[1:51:46] it didn't shock me I'm not surprised
[1:51:49] when Sinners sin and I'm not surprised
[1:51:52] when the world World celebrates iniquity
[1:51:54] and it's going to be worse and worse
[1:51:56] what's more concerning to me is when the
[1:51:59] church allows society and iniquity
[1:52:03] that's abounding to breathe cool air on
[1:52:07] our love when we dry up and when we
[1:52:11] freeze and we no longer show one another
[1:52:15] that Godly love that
[1:52:17] unconditional always forgiving love
[1:52:21] that's what I'm concerned ConEd about
[1:52:23] I'm not concerned about pagans being
[1:52:27] Pagan you understand the origins of the
[1:52:30] Olympic is
[1:52:32] Pagan it started in Pagan and it'll end
[1:52:35] in
[1:52:37] Pagan and so I'm not surprised I'm not
[1:52:40] even deeply concerned because the Bible
[1:52:43] tells us if you're a Bible student you
[1:52:46] know it's going to wax worse and
[1:52:50] worse I need some help it's going to get
[1:52:54] darker and darker and darker in there
[1:52:57] out there and the only answer is for it
[1:53:00] to get brighter and brighter and
[1:53:03] brighter in here and in order for that
[1:53:06] to happen we're going to have to Tha
[1:53:09] out our cold
[1:53:13] love we we we get too quick in throwing
[1:53:18] one another under the
[1:53:21] bus if if you dropped the ball you
[1:53:25] dropped the ball
[1:53:29] Fred you did no need to throw somebody
[1:53:35] else you did and there's nothing wrong
[1:53:38] there's no shame in saying I was
[1:53:42] wrong in the church age book we have
[1:53:45] that quote where it is said this is what
[1:53:48] we're missing in this hour the solution
[1:53:50] I'm paraphrasing my well it's a
[1:53:52] paraphrase book might as well paraphrase
[1:53:55] it the whole thing is this this we we we
[1:53:58] need to just cry out I've been
[1:54:02] wrong but we're protecting our pride and
[1:54:05] we're protecting our reputation and so
[1:54:08] we it's easier for us to throw a brother
[1:54:10] under the bus or a sister under the bus
[1:54:13] or shove the
[1:54:16] blame if we stumble in on Noah and he's
[1:54:19] laying drunk and his his nakedness is is
[1:54:25] exposed his sons loved him so much that
[1:54:28] they covered him up and they turned
[1:54:31] around and backed out of the room yes
[1:54:34] they weren't excusing his
[1:54:37] overindulgence they weren't excusing his
[1:54:40] carelessness to Lounge absolutely 100%
[1:54:44] naked they were showing him
[1:54:48] honor they weren't condoning his sin
[1:54:51] they underst what families
[1:54:54] do I'm not going to get a lot of help
[1:54:58] that's what families do they they fight
[1:55:01] in the
[1:55:04] backyard yours
[1:55:06] don't maybe not fisted but group
[1:55:13] text somebody's preaching
[1:55:16] today they fight in the group text or
[1:55:20] some fight on Facebook come
[1:55:23] on some have these
[1:55:26] strange
[1:55:28] post and somebody will say to me
[1:55:30] sometime brother Shelly or Pastor or
[1:55:32] what do do you know what they meant by
[1:55:34] that I said it's not meant for us to
[1:55:35] know it wasn't directed to
[1:55:39] us if you don't know what it
[1:55:41] meant it wasn't directed to
[1:55:44] you it was a personal dirty underwear
[1:55:49] thing that should have been washed and
[1:55:52] out on the backline but instead it got
[1:55:56] slung and drugged through public social
[1:55:59] media that's the hour we're living in
[1:56:02] now we should fight it out if we need to
[1:56:05] as families in the backyard but when we
[1:56:07] come around to the front
[1:56:10] yard we are a united front we are the
[1:56:14] body of Christ we are Bible Believers
[1:56:18] some of us are
[1:56:20] neopians cuz we found our
[1:56:24] bone hello I'm not ashamed to say that I
[1:56:28] found my bones I found my
[1:56:32] tribe praise God and I'm happy never
[1:56:37] regretted it I'm happy it's not always
[1:56:40] easy but I'm happy because I don't want
[1:56:42] to I don't want to live where he doesn't
[1:56:45] want me and I don't want to die
[1:56:46] certainly don't want to die out of my
[1:56:49] place amen
[1:56:52] I would have liked to have gone and
[1:56:54] helped out the Saints in Tucson it was
[1:56:56] on my heart it's something I would have
[1:56:58] loved to have done there were many there
[1:57:01] who would have not received me but there
[1:57:03] were many who would have there were many
[1:57:06] who prayed all kinds of prayers some so
[1:57:09] desperate that they even told us at
[1:57:11] breakfast uh we're praying that God
[1:57:14] sends an angel into brother Shell's
[1:57:16] bedroom at night and calls him to Tucson
[1:57:19] I it's nice to be loved it's nice to be
[1:57:22] wanted but as I told them that day three
[1:57:28] weeks of my
[1:57:30] preaching three weeks of my long sermons
[1:57:34] and you'd send me right back to Alabama
[1:57:36] where I came
[1:57:38] from because coming to a special meeting
[1:57:40] and getting it once every few months is
[1:57:43] not the same as having to face it
[1:57:45] service after service after service
[1:57:47] that's why we need a revelation of who
[1:57:49] our pastor is and we stay with him
[1:57:52] because he has some kind of a calling to
[1:57:54] help us get
[1:57:56] over we're not drifting from church to
[1:57:58] church and Faith come on now the enemy
[1:58:02] the spirit of the age has breathed on
[1:58:05] the love of the church this is husband
[1:58:08] wife love this is God's love to us our
[1:58:11] love to one another therefore all men
[1:58:13] shall know that they are my
[1:58:16] disciples because they make all the
[1:58:18] right
[1:58:19] quotations no because they have
[1:58:22] love one for
[1:58:25] another and love would rather take the
[1:58:33] blame than to excuse themselves and push
[1:58:37] the blame on someone else if we're in
[1:58:40] that kind of a family and we
[1:58:43] are if we're in that kind of family
[1:58:45] there's only one solution for us and
[1:58:48] that is to pray like wild men pray like
[1:58:51] wild women that the fire of the Holy
[1:58:54] Ghost will burn so
[1:58:58] hot so bright so hot so powerful that it
[1:59:03] thaws out our Frozen
[1:59:08] love come on greater love hath no man
[1:59:12] than this that a man would lay down his
[1:59:14] life for his friends Jesus did that on
[1:59:18] our behalf but sometimes we have to do
[1:59:20] that for one another
[1:59:22] because not to do it would be to expose
[1:59:25] someone in a way they don't particularly
[1:59:27] need to be exposed in such an hour as
[1:59:30] this are you following what I'm saying
[1:59:33] so when you're not taking any portion of
[1:59:35] the responsibility for something that
[1:59:37] you certainly had some responsibility in
[1:59:41] and you're shoveling it on someone else
[1:59:43] you are demonstrating the words of Jesus
[1:59:45] in our day unfortunately it's not the
[1:59:48] positive
[1:59:49] ones it's the ones that say when
[1:59:52] iniquity prevails the love of many shall
[1:59:56] freeze cold love I'm not going to preach
[1:59:58] on this you can go back and find the
[2:00:00] sermon I preached many years ago on the
[2:00:02] on the stronghold of cold love cold love
[2:00:07] is a demonic stronghold against the
[2:00:10] church we may enjoy temporary blessings
[2:00:13] and seasonal
[2:00:15] breakthroughs but we cannot experience
[2:00:18] true lasting Revival as long as Frozen
[2:00:23] love prevails Among Us amen cold love
[2:00:29] shuts down the power of
[2:00:34] prayer Cold Love Takes worship into will
[2:00:39] worship which is not enough we worship
[2:00:43] out of a love affair we're not using it
[2:00:47] as an act of our own will we're not
[2:00:50] doing it to exalt ourselves we're doing
[2:00:53] it to exalt the king cold love will shut
[2:00:57] down prayer it shifts Godly worship to
[2:01:01] will worship and it will disable the
[2:01:04] flow of the healing virtue in a church
[2:01:07] sickness will prevail in a house where
[2:01:11] Frozen Love is the
[2:01:16] stronghold sickness prevails confusion
[2:01:20] prevails
[2:01:22] chaos
[2:01:23] prevails there are some people who think
[2:01:26] that you can entertain a demon and you
[2:01:29] can bring somebody out of their bondage
[2:01:31] by giving them more
[2:01:35] Fellowship but I want you to know you
[2:01:37] can't Fellowship the devil out of
[2:01:41] anybody you can't Fellowship Rebellion
[2:01:44] out of somebody's heart you can't
[2:01:47] Fellowship cold love out of somebody's
[2:01:50] heart that's why churches will work so
[2:01:53] hard to to uh build and and promote a a
[2:01:57] youth uh uh uh Ministry and I believe in
[2:02:01] that with all my heart I think that we
[2:02:03] should spend more of our attention on
[2:02:05] young people than we do so don't
[2:02:07] misunderstand me but some people think
[2:02:09] that giving them something to do every
[2:02:11] night of the week is what's going to
[2:02:13] cause them to come into alignment with
[2:02:16] the promises of God for their life not
[2:02:19] until every night is a prayer meeting
[2:02:26] if every night is movie
[2:02:29] night if every night is bingo night you
[2:02:32] kids don't play Bingo do you Uno Uno
[2:02:37] Dutch
[2:02:38] blits whatever else we like to BL if
[2:02:40] every night is game night that's not
[2:02:43] going to bring Deliverance either it's
[2:02:46] not going to throw out our
[2:02:48] love if we think that entertaining is
[2:02:51] the key it's not we need it we need
[2:02:53] Recreation we need togetherness we need
[2:02:56] to create an environment of safety not
[2:02:59] only for young people but for all of us
[2:03:01] amen we need that but we need not think
[2:03:04] that that is the
[2:03:07] key it doesn't cause the lesbian not to
[2:03:10] desire to be a lesbian or the alcoholic
[2:03:14] not to be an alcoholic there's only one
[2:03:16] thing that'll do that and that's the
[2:03:19] fire of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:24] and we need him we need him we need him
[2:03:27] we need him we need him we need him are
[2:03:30] you with
[2:03:31] me we don't want the flow of healing to
[2:03:34] be so uh charity I'm on uh half a page
[2:03:39] we're not doing too good if we're going
[2:03:41] to get to 11 got to
[2:03:43] hurry Revelation chapter
[2:03:46] 2 verse
[2:03:48] 1-6 unto the angel of the church of Leo
[2:03:53] deia
[2:03:55] right is that what he
[2:03:57] said are you sure this is Ephesus let's
[2:04:02] read these things saith he that holdeth
[2:04:05] the Seven Stars in his right hand who
[2:04:08] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[2:04:10] candlesticks anybody with me yes sir I
[2:04:13] Know Thy works and thy labor and thy
[2:04:17] patience and how thou cast not bear them
[2:04:21] which are
[2:04:22] evil and thou Hast tried them which say
[2:04:26] they are Apostles and are
[2:04:30] not and has found them
[2:04:33] liars and has borne and has patience and
[2:04:36] for my name sake has labored and H has
[2:04:40] not fainted this is beautiful words here
[2:04:45] nevertheless are you sure that didn't
[2:04:48] say Le oysa
[2:04:52] are you sure this is
[2:04:56] Ephesus am I mistaken when I tell you
[2:05:00] that Ephesus is not the last Church age
[2:05:04] but indeed it was the first church
[2:05:12] age do you remember that Ephesus was the
[2:05:16] church age that was
[2:05:19] closer to the time of the ministry of
[2:05:23] [Music]
[2:05:25] Jesus there were those
[2:05:28] alive who knew the ministry of Jesus who
[2:05:33] saw the ministry of Jesus who partook of
[2:05:37] the minister are you
[2:05:39] here of
[2:05:41] Jesus and they were in Ephesus First
[2:05:45] Church age and the message to Ephesus
[2:05:50] Church later to its
[2:05:53] age was
[2:05:56] nevertheless you got a lot of things
[2:05:59] right
[2:06:01] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[2:06:04] thee you read it I'm getting already a
[2:06:06] little tired
[2:06:09] here first love because thou Hast left
[2:06:14] thy first
[2:06:19] love the real ru loot of Frozen
[2:06:25] love the real cause of waxing cold in
[2:06:31] your love is because you leave your
[2:06:35] first
[2:06:37] love if you emphatically hold on to
[2:06:41] Jesus as the number one love of your
[2:06:47] life you will so value his love for you
[2:06:52] that you long to be a
[2:06:55] pipeline you long to be a conduit for
[2:06:59] that love to flow through
[2:07:01] you that kind of love doesn't keep a
[2:07:03] record of
[2:07:07] wrongs that kind of love doesn't behave
[2:07:10] itself
[2:07:13] unseemingly that kind of love doesn't
[2:07:16] get puffed
[2:07:17] up I want to tell you something folks
[2:07:21] years years of service for the Lord it
[2:07:24] doesn't give us a free
[2:07:27] pass it doesn't mean that we don't have
[2:07:30] to keep
[2:07:32] fighting but I can tell you something
[2:07:34] and if it sounds boastful I apologize
[2:07:37] for the way I've made it sound it's not
[2:07:39] my intention but I've been
[2:07:42] around I've been around a time or
[2:07:45] two uh I didn't choose this
[2:07:51] it chose
[2:07:54] me it did I I'm not I'm not here doing
[2:07:59] this thing because this is what I wanted
[2:08:01] to
[2:08:02] do or what I would like to do I've been
[2:08:06] arrested I've been
[2:08:09] apprehended I've been
[2:08:11] forced into doing something that I was
[2:08:14] never comfortable doing but I didn't
[2:08:17] really have a
[2:08:19] choice what of our ministry brethren in
[2:08:22] the
[2:08:23] Philippines who has labored so hard he
[2:08:26] has worked so hard to spread the
[2:08:31] word he is a a leader in the
[2:08:35] Philippines of doing what they call
[2:08:38] mystery
[2:08:40] Expos where they will go into a
[2:08:43] community and they will have seminars
[2:08:47] with the denominational
[2:08:49] pastors and they will share share with
[2:08:51] them some of the mighty things that God
[2:08:54] has done and is doing and have baptized
[2:08:59] many Pastors in the name of the Lord
[2:09:02] Jesus Christ they have shepherded many
[2:09:06] churches coming out of error into truth
[2:09:11] he posted something a few days ago about
[2:09:14] pastors I'm sure you've read it similar
[2:09:17] to something that Hawk posted not too
[2:09:20] long ago
[2:09:21] mentioning some of the Perils of being a
[2:09:25] pastor It Looks So Glamorous you know we
[2:09:29] even get our own parking
[2:09:34] spot So
[2:09:36] Glamorous the money just rolls in for
[2:09:42] pastors we're the only ones in the whole
[2:09:46] wide world that only work of three or
[2:09:48] four hours a week and make as much money
[2:09:51] as we do and and everybody shouts amen
[2:09:54] you know it sounds a whole lot more
[2:09:57] glamorous than it is look how quiet
[2:10:01] people
[2:10:03] get when does anybody take up for
[2:10:07] pastors when do you take up for
[2:10:10] pastors I I rarely do it because it
[2:10:14] doesn't look
[2:10:16] good for the pastor to have to be the
[2:10:19] one to do it does it it doesn't look
[2:10:21] good it looks self-serving but every now
[2:10:24] and again you just get a bit
[2:10:27] overwhelmed and you just want to speak
[2:10:29] up not only for
[2:10:31] yourselves but for other
[2:10:34] pastors he posted that and I I commented
[2:10:37] right away happened to see it right away
[2:10:40] and I commented right away and I said my
[2:10:43] I'm praying for men like
[2:10:47] you who didn't choose to be a pastor but
[2:10:53] the office of Pastor chose
[2:10:56] you you know there may be tens of
[2:11:00] thousands looking for a meal ticket but
[2:11:03] let us not forget that there's got to be
[2:11:05] a few that are in it to win it that are
[2:11:09] in it for the right
[2:11:11] reason that are in it to see a body of
[2:11:14] Believers make the
[2:11:16] Rapture got to believe God I've got to
[2:11:19] believe I couldn't go on on if I
[2:11:22] couldn't believe the thing that stirred
[2:11:25] me up the most was not the fact that he
[2:11:28] posted that I've actually read that
[2:11:31] before but it was the fact that another
[2:11:33] brother that I know of in the message
[2:11:35] was the first one of the very first few
[2:11:37] people maybe even ahead of me I he had
[2:11:39] to be because I read his comment uh a
[2:11:43] and
[2:11:43] his his comment was something like this
[2:11:47] God forgive me if I don't say it just
[2:11:48] right I don't remember exactly how it
[2:11:51] was was worded but it said something
[2:11:53] like this you know basically most
[2:11:55] pastors are doing exactly what they want
[2:11:58] to do you know they just really enjoy
[2:12:03] the position of being a pastor in other
[2:12:06] words indicating that that that many
[2:12:09] just got up and went and I agree many
[2:12:13] did but our brother wasn't trying in
[2:12:17] that one moment to emphasize those who
[2:12:20] were mama called or Daddy called he was
[2:12:23] trying to bring a little honor and
[2:12:24] prayer
[2:12:25] covering for those who Mama didn't call
[2:12:28] and daddy didn't call but God called and
[2:12:32] what's the first comment that someone
[2:12:34] makes a resentful comment to show you
[2:12:36] how people really
[2:12:39] feel he was being reflective of his own
[2:12:43] heart and the Heart of so many just like
[2:12:47] him he sees it as an opportunity to to
[2:12:51] lay down in a bed of ease I commented to
[2:12:55] brother Malo and I said no man in his
[2:13:00] right mind would choose to be a pastor
[2:13:05] especially not in this
[2:13:07] age so I'm praying for those who didn't
[2:13:11] choose the office but the office chose
[2:13:13] them I want you to understand that we're
[2:13:16] living in such an hour that that we
[2:13:19] better know that we know that we know
[2:13:23] that we're in alignment and that we're
[2:13:25] in Covenant with
[2:13:26] somebody who wasn't mama called who
[2:13:29] wasn't Daddy called who wasn't big mama
[2:13:33] called but who was God called because
[2:13:37] the reality is some are called and some
[2:13:39] are sent and some just got up and went
[2:13:41] that's right and we don't need any of
[2:13:43] that in this hour that will never get
[2:13:45] the bride where the bride needs to
[2:13:48] be this early church age the very first
[2:13:53] one Jesus had barely ascended and left
[2:13:57] the scene and they had
[2:14:00] already left
[2:14:08] their how is it possible that hardly a
[2:14:12] generation has passed and they had
[2:14:15] already left their first love some
[2:14:19] people love church
[2:14:22] some people love the
[2:14:25] pastor and some people love
[2:14:30] Jesus the ones who love Jesus are are
[2:14:34] the ones who don't just show up on
[2:14:35] Sunday
[2:14:39] morning they fight their way
[2:14:43] through that's what brother green used
[2:14:45] to
[2:14:46] say some love church come on Sunday
[2:14:49] morning some love their pastor come on
[2:14:51] Sunday night and some love Jesus they
[2:14:54] come during the
[2:14:55] week well you got to admit it's
[2:14:57] harder you've worked all day you're wore
[2:15:01] out 99 degrees and and and and like
[2:15:05] yesterday morning or didn't know this

[2:15:10] doesn't that sound amazing at 10 minutes
[2:15:12] till 7 this morning 6:50 the the the
[2:15:15] temperature was 72 that just makes you
[2:15:18] just want to go right out in your
[2:15:20] pajamas and L down in the front yard
[2:15:22] cool until you keep
[2:15:25] reading
[2:15:27] 72°
[2:15:29] 97%
[2:15:34] humidity in that weather you don't even
[2:15:36] have to get a shower just go out inside
[2:15:38] you'll shower right off that's terrible
[2:15:42] humidity and people work in that outside
[2:15:46] you Brethren were they were telling me
[2:15:48] we're working up high in the fellowship
[2:15:50] hall doing different thing hot hot hot
[2:15:54] hot you wore out your electrolytes are
[2:15:58] gone you're weary I understand the the
[2:16:03] need to
[2:16:07] relax but those who really remember
[2:16:11] their first
[2:16:13] love will go above and beyond what the
[2:16:17] physical body demands I'm not trying to
[2:16:20] hurt nobody's
[2:16:22] feelings I remember what it was like the
[2:16:25] first years of our marriage we had one
[2:16:30] vehicle we could hardly afford that we
[2:16:34] had
[2:16:35] one and that means we either had to go
[2:16:38] together or only one of us went wherever
[2:16:41] it was that we were going we didn't have
[2:16:44] a big spread out house I'm living in the
[2:16:46] house right now I was living in in 1990
[2:16:51] and you can get in one end of the house
[2:16:53] and talk you don't have to scream and be
[2:16:56] heard in the other end of the house it's
[2:16:57] just not that big of a house no
[2:16:59] downstairs no no Wing away from the rest
[2:17:02] of the house I can even stand in the
[2:17:05] garage that was closed in to be a den
[2:17:07] and talk and be heard all the way down
[2:17:09] the hall and so uh I know what it was
[2:17:12] like to have sleep
[2:17:15] Disturbed I know what it was like to
[2:17:18] have a baby that would get out of whack
[2:17:20] and days and nights mixed up and and all
[2:17:23] those things I remember it
[2:17:25] well I was not like some around here who

[2:19:06] the
[2:19:07] church we weren't in love with the
[2:19:10] preacher we were in love with
[2:19:13] Jesus and when you get really in love
[2:19:16] with him you start looking for an excuse
[2:19:19] to be in his presence
[2:19:23] presence instead of looking for an
[2:19:25] excuse not to I understand when people
[2:19:27] are made to work but I don't understand
[2:19:30] people volunteering to work and missing
[2:19:32] a
[2:19:33] service that I don't understand it goes
[2:19:37] against what I read in the Bible it goes
[2:19:39] against what I read in the message of
[2:19:40] the hour and I I don't think that I'm
[2:19:42] dumb when I when I observe they're
[2:19:45] running from something if we're ever
[2:19:48] it's quiet if we're ever going to get
[2:19:51] back to a RedHot love for one
[2:19:54] another first we're going to have to get
[2:19:56] back to when he was our first love what
[2:20:00] does it mean to be first love it means
[2:20:03] to love him above and
[2:20:06] beyond sir my number
[2:20:09] one
[2:20:11] affection my number one love my number
[2:20:15] one priority is Jesus Christ and his
[2:20:20] business
[2:20:21] his Kingdom Business nevertheless I have
[2:20:24] somewhat against thee because thou has
[2:20:27] left thy First Love and here was the
[2:20:29] solution to the Ephesian Church age and
[2:20:32] I'm wondering if it worked in
[2:20:36] Ephesus why wouldn't it work for us in
[2:20:40] the closing hours of leod DEA remember
[2:20:44] therefore from
[2:20:47] whence this isn't leod deia this is
[2:20:51] Ephesus First Church
[2:20:54] yes are you going to go to sleep on me
[2:20:57] now first
[2:20:59] church repent from where thou Hast
[2:21:04] Fallen remember excuse me
[2:21:08] remember where you have fallen from and
[2:21:12] repent and do
[2:21:15] the if you're going to make him your
[2:21:17] first love again
[2:21:21] it stands the reason that you might have
[2:21:23] to repeat your first works again
[2:21:26] remember when you were
[2:21:29] excited remember when truth excited you
[2:21:32] remember when you didn't want to miss a
[2:21:34] service because you were afraid that
[2:21:36] something would happen and you'd miss it
[2:21:38] and you'd have to listen to Sister
[2:21:40] Joyce or sister Alfreda on tell about
[2:21:46] it cuz you knew they were going to be
[2:21:49] there anybody I remember a day like that
[2:21:52] yes sir you remember a day like that
[2:21:54] that Services would end and close and
[2:21:57] nobody wanted to move nobody rushed to
[2:22:02] Fellowship everybody just wanted to
[2:22:05] linger in the presence of the
[2:22:07] Lord and then they w't then we all went
[2:22:10] out to
[2:22:11] eat we couldn't get enough of one
[2:22:14] another's
[2:22:16] company because Jesus was our first love
[2:22:19] and it C caused our love for one another
[2:22:22] to
[2:22:23] burn to
[2:22:28] thrive many was the Sunday afternoon
[2:22:32] that without announcing a meal a meal
[2:22:35] would just
[2:22:37] happen one little family would bring
[2:22:40] theirs and another little family would
[2:22:41] bring theirs and another little family
[2:22:42] would bring theirs and they were just
[2:22:43] going to share it with their family the
[2:22:46] next thing you know there'd be a
[2:22:47] fellowship hall full of people eating on
[2:22:49] the on the on the lunch of just a few
[2:22:51] because we wanted to to be together and
[2:22:54] we want not to play
[2:22:58] volleyball that wasn't our driving
[2:23:01] force God ministered in those
[2:23:04] times I remember a young man that was
[2:23:06] about to make a terrible mistake in his
[2:23:09] life he was about to marry someone who
[2:23:13] really didn't
[2:23:14] believe in any way like he believed and
[2:23:18] we're sitting there after the meal and a
[2:23:20] vision
[2:23:22] drops I saw God delivering that young
[2:23:24] man out of the mouth of a
[2:23:26] dragon I begin to speak those words to
[2:23:29] his parents and God was faithful to do
[2:23:32] exactly what he said he was going to do
[2:23:34] and that didn't take place in the pull
[2:23:36] pit it didn't even take place in the
[2:23:39] sanctuary what are they building a
[2:23:41] fellowship hall
[2:23:44] for
[2:23:48] Fellowship food yeah
[2:23:51] yeah that's a part of
[2:23:53] Fellowship we have to
[2:23:55] eat because we understand that there are
[2:23:58] times and and let me tell you something
[2:24:01] when we
[2:24:02] Fellowship
[2:24:04] together in a hall
[2:24:07] together there's less of an atmosphere
[2:24:10] that gives us the tendency to
[2:24:18] talk it's hard to talk about somebody
[2:24:21] when they're sitting at your table sir
[2:24:24] it's easy to talk about somebody when
[2:24:27] you're over at somebody's house and
[2:24:28] nobody knows you're there because you're
[2:24:30] so secretive about it even to the point
[2:24:33] of lying about where you
[2:24:35] are when you build a an atmosphere like
[2:24:39] that I can only
[2:24:41] expect that anything will happen and
[2:24:44] anything will be said and unknown damage
[2:24:47] can be done but when we get together
[2:24:51] on brother we're creating a different
[2:24:54] atmosphere that's right somebody called
[2:24:56] me some time ago and said if we can get
[2:24:59] if we can get the right uh uh
[2:25:02] environment I'd like to put a piano I'd
[2:25:05] like to donate a piano and put a piano
[2:25:08] in there as long as we know that it
[2:25:10] would be protected great
[2:25:13] idea because God can
[2:25:16] move when the pie is eaten and the bones
[2:25:21] are discarded and somebody with a gift
[2:25:24] walks over to the piano and starts to
[2:25:26] play haven't we seen what God can
[2:25:30] do yes sir
[2:25:33] oh I don't know what you came to hear
[2:25:35] today but this is what the Lord said so
[2:25:38] I hope you can receive we need that we
[2:25:42] need that we don't need everybody
[2:25:45] pulling in their own
[2:25:48] Direction on now used to grieve my heart
[2:25:52] through the years I always wanted this
[2:25:55] to be a place I know God wanted it to be
[2:25:58] it was a refuge and it used to grieve my
[2:26:00] heart when everybody was trying to pull
[2:26:02] everybody to their house when there was
[2:26:05] a great opportunity to be gathered
[2:26:08] together here because I knew that
[2:26:12] inevitably if it was there somebody
[2:26:15] would be or feel left out but if we were
[2:26:19] all here here we can be here it's ours
[2:26:22] it belongs to us if we want to walk we
[2:26:26] don't have to ask anybody can I walk if
[2:26:28] we want to ride a bike we don't have to
[2:26:30] ask anybody can I ride a bike it's
[2:26:33] ours we only ask a few things our
[2:26:36] children are feel safe here we want it
[2:26:39] to always be that way I wanted to gather
[2:26:43] people here because that was the vision
[2:26:46] of this house and it's been difficult to
[2:26:48] do that through the years without a
[2:26:49] place to to
[2:26:54] eat thank you sir thank you brother gy
[2:26:58] thank you all of you Brothers every one
[2:27:00] of you who've worked and made a
[2:27:03] sacrifice they told me brother gy told
[2:27:05] me that the young man who owns the
[2:27:07] business has already acquired the second
[2:27:09] unit because it's going to take two
[2:27:11] units we didn't have the money to pay to
[2:27:13] have the second one put in or to
[2:27:15] purchase the unit but because of
[2:27:17] everything changing and different things
[2:27:19] happening he wanted to make sure he
[2:27:21] could get a unit to match that one so he
[2:27:23] went on and got a hold of it
[2:27:26] anticipating maybe he's got more faith
[2:27:28] than I do anticipating that we would
[2:27:31] soon need
[2:27:32] it God is
[2:27:34] good and I've already anticipated the
[2:27:37] fact that we're going to have to pass
[2:27:38] the hat to pay the power
[2:27:43] bill cuz it was about $1,300 uh a total
[2:27:47] for everything this month and if you
[2:27:49] don't think that makes a difference in a
[2:27:51] month like July when when offerings are
[2:27:54] smaller and when the heat is intense and
[2:27:59] the air condition has to run over but
[2:28:01] you know if God can do
[2:28:06] that I'm not speaking negative oh no I'm
[2:28:10] speaking positive I'm just letting you
[2:28:12] know that it it's an ongoing thing it's
[2:28:17] an ongoing thing to have it God is good
[2:28:19] he's blessed us he's going to keep
[2:28:21] blessing us now remember therefore from
[2:28:24] whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do
[2:28:26] the first works or else I will come unto
[2:28:28] thee quickly and will remove thy
[2:28:31] Candlestick out of
[2:28:34] his
[2:28:39] place I've always been baffled by this
[2:28:42] verse of scripture and I've always
[2:28:44] wanted to say what did the poor Pastor
[2:28:46] have to do with any of
[2:28:48] this what did the poor Messenger to the
[2:28:51] age have to do with
[2:28:54] this because that's the Candlestick he's
[2:28:57] talking
[2:28:58] about he didn't say I'm going to remove
[2:29:01] the Candlestick out of its place as
[2:29:03] though it were an inanimate object like
[2:29:05] a
[2:29:07] lampstand he said out of his
[2:29:10] place if you don't get back to your
[2:29:13] first love God was saying to the
[2:29:15] Ephesian church I'm going to remove the
[2:29:18] light I'm just being honest I think many
[2:29:21] many many Bible scholars agree that
[2:29:23] that's the meaning I'm not making this
[2:29:25] up or pulling it from a quote somewhere
[2:29:27] that I think many people understand that
[2:29:29] God was saying to the church first and
[2:29:32] then to the
[2:29:34] age if you don't if you don't Embrace
[2:29:37] what I've sent you let's see how you do
[2:29:40] without
[2:29:41] it but this thou Hast that thou hatest
[2:29:46] the Deeds of the
[2:29:48] nicians which I also hate those who try
[2:29:51] to conquer the leoty and treat them like
[2:29:53] little peons while they show us how
[2:29:56] Mighty and lofty they are in the things
[2:29:59] of God God knows that is not my
[2:30:02] intention however I'm very thankful for
[2:30:05] the experiences that God's given me
[2:30:06] through the years and I am fully
[2:30:09] persuaded that I could help a person or
[2:30:12] two along the way not to have to hit the
[2:30:15] same dead
[2:30:17] ends and slam doors
[2:30:20] and ceilings that I had to hit along the
[2:30:24] way any man with a heart would like to
[2:30:27] be able to spare his own children that's
[2:30:29] right from having to learn the hard way
[2:30:32] I always worry about a parent who has
[2:30:34] this attitude I learn the hard way he'll
[2:30:37] have to too I'm a little worried about
[2:30:39] that I don't think that's how it's
[2:30:41] supposed to work generationally I think
[2:30:43] each generation is supposed to try to
[2:30:45] set up the Next Generation to have a
[2:30:48] higher ceiling
[2:30:51] oh Hallelujah I am 56 years old I have
[2:30:56] lived more years behind me that I could
[2:31:00] possibly have in this earth ahead of me
[2:31:03] but I've got
[2:31:05] children not just natural children but
[2:31:08] I've got spiritual children who can go
[2:31:11] higher now don't wait for me to die for
[2:31:15] you to fly you can go higher now you can
[2:31:20] get more now than I was ever able to get
[2:31:24] you can accomplish more now than I was
[2:31:27] ever able to accomplish if you reach for
[2:31:32] it let me say let me just say if I were
[2:31:34] sitting where you were and someone just
[2:31:36] said that to me here's what I would have
[2:31:40] done
[2:31:43] amen that's what I would have done
[2:31:48] amen because it's it's worth putting a
[2:31:52] little effort to and don't you want your
[2:31:57] children I I know some people have this
[2:31:59] attitude you know they've got to learn
[2:32:01] by the sweat of their BR like I did they
[2:32:03] got to learn by you know being punched
[2:32:06] and knocked around like what my goodness
[2:32:10] you despise them the crying is that
[2:32:13] bad the diapers stink that bad that you
[2:32:17] would wish something like that on them
[2:32:20] woo my I would that they would go higher
[2:32:25] than I ever could find a place to go in
[2:32:29] Worship in the depths of the word may
[2:32:32] they go deeper than I was ever able to
[2:32:36] scratch let me read two4 in the
[2:32:38] Amplified before we go
[2:32:41] home but I have this one charge to make
[2:32:44] against
[2:32:46] you that you have left abandoned the
[2:32:49] love that you had it
[2:32:51] first you have deserted
[2:32:54] me your first
[2:32:59] love the only consolation that we have
[2:33:03] this morning the only way we can look at
[2:33:05] each other is we know that that was
[2:33:07] directed to the Ephesian church and to
[2:33:09] the Ephesian Church age but the reality
[2:33:12] is the spirit of the Lord has updated it
[2:33:15] and he's given it to us today and he's
[2:33:18] saying to us I like all your
[2:33:19] accomplishments I like all I like the
[2:33:21] fact you've paid off the property I like
[2:33:24] the fact that you've won many spiritual
[2:33:26] victories along the way but there's one
[2:33:29] little thing about you that I'm quite
[2:33:30] disappointed in and that is you've
[2:33:32] allowed your love to grow cold because
[2:33:34] you have
[2:33:36] left the reason why you started in the
[2:33:39] first
[2:33:42] place was
[2:33:44] him it was him
[2:33:50] first is is in in Greek it's protos and
[2:33:53] it it means foremost in order of
[2:33:57] importance before beginning best the
[2:34:00] chiefest the first of all and that word
[2:34:04] love as I mentioned a moment ago is the
[2:34:06] Agape I wanted you to see it affection
[2:34:09] or benevolence the quality of warm
[2:34:11] regard for an interest in another esteem
[2:34:14] affection regard love love
[2:34:16] feasts Agape is a word that is even used
[2:34:19] used to describe festivals of love and
[2:34:22] that's not the
[2:34:24] Olympics it's not talking about
[2:34:27] debauchery no it's talking about as
[2:34:30] Wesley preached it's talking about a
[2:34:33] feast of love when the saints of God get
[2:34:36] together and they start loving on
[2:34:39] him and all of a sudden they look around
[2:34:42] the room anybody ever had this happen
[2:34:44] you start loving on him and he starts
[2:34:46] loving on you and then you look around
[2:34:48] the room and everybody just starts
[2:34:50] looking
[2:34:55] lovable I've had it I've had it happen
[2:34:58] it's one of the reasons why I'm still
[2:34:59] standing
[2:35:00] here is because when I would be in the
[2:35:03] throws of Despair like Moses and I would
[2:35:06] be complaining to God about the
[2:35:08] hardheaded murmuring grumbling belly
[2:35:11] aing
[2:35:16] people that he called me to lead through
[2:35:18] the years
[2:35:20] you're not the only crop I've
[2:35:24] had and all of a sudden I'd get to
[2:35:27] church and I'd start loving on him and
[2:35:29] he would start loving on me and Josh I
[2:35:33] would look around the room at the same
[2:35:35] people that I had just thought in my
[2:35:37] mind hardheaded rebellious stubborn mean
[2:35:41] mean
[2:35:43] bitter rotten let's don't go any
[2:35:48] further and all of a sudden they would
[2:35:51] look like the most unbelievable
[2:35:53] successful Victorious handsome beautiful
[2:35:57] Godly Shining Light coming out of their
[2:36:00] faces and I knew that they hadn't
[2:36:03] changed that quickly I hadn't changed
[2:36:06] that quickly it could only be when you
[2:36:08] start seeing people through his
[2:36:11] eyes that's right come
[2:36:15] on aren't you glad that when he sees you
[2:36:20] he sees you through the
[2:36:23] blood if we ever catch a glimpse of one
[2:36:27] another in the glory through the
[2:36:31] blood the warts are gone the Crooked
[2:36:34] ears are gone the broken nose is gone
[2:36:38] the pimples are
[2:36:40] gone the bald head is
[2:36:45] gone the triple chin is gone
[2:36:50] it's the beauty of the
[2:36:52] Lord that shines out of us all are you
[2:36:56] with me good I need just a few more
[2:36:58] minutes you are you sure do you need to
[2:37:00] do a few Jumping Jacks and then sit down
[2:37:05] anybody I'd be happy for you
[2:37:09] to in the church age
[2:37:12] book the thyon
[2:37:15] age it's written I want to give a
[2:37:18] warning right here here it says
[2:37:21] concerning the last days that because of
[2:37:23] abounding iniquity the love of many will
[2:37:26] wax cold in the leodan or last age now
[2:37:30] this word was not directed to the leodan
[2:37:32] church age it was directed to the
[2:37:34] Ephesian Church age but the evil of
[2:37:37] every
[2:37:38] age has culminated and become
[2:37:41] exacerbated in the leodan church age so
[2:37:46] here we
[2:37:47] are in the leodan chur or last age
[2:37:50] selflove and love for material things
[2:37:55] will take the place of the true love of
[2:38:00] God
[2:38:03] toys will replace the kingdom
[2:38:09] work we need to guard against the power
[2:38:12] of sin in these last days so many are
[2:38:14] getting so hard because they haven't
[2:38:16] realized the effect of this last day
[2:38:19] spirit
[2:38:20] it is time to draw nigh to God and let
[2:38:22] him fill our lives with his love or we
[2:38:25] will feel the coldness of the last day
[2:38:27] church and reject the truth of God which
[2:38:31] alone is able to help us and many are
[2:38:35] going to find that to be the reality a
[2:38:38] few more turns and curves down the road
[2:38:41] the Oneness of unity I wanted to share
[2:38:44] this that now a pastor any cult some
[2:38:47] little literature you'd read might say
[2:38:49] to you the days of Miracles is passed
[2:38:52] watch what he says here because this was
[2:38:55] if I would have gotten to this place
[2:38:57] this is where I was going to take you in
[2:38:59] a different direction for a few moments
[2:39:01] I'll do that uh either Tuesday night or
[2:39:04] Sunday but but let let's get just a a a
[2:39:07] preast a foraste of of what it's about
[2:39:10] he said that's a good place for the
[2:39:13] devil to slip one of them Spirits in
[2:39:16] there and make you a worse person you
[2:39:20] was when you was a
[2:39:24] sinner how could anybody be
[2:39:27] worse in the church than when they were
[2:39:30] a
[2:39:34] sinner well I've been around and I want
[2:39:36] you to know it's
[2:39:38] possible cause the
[2:39:40] religious
[2:39:44] sinner do I need to
[2:39:46] preach is the worst of all you get a a a
[2:39:52] a man with a little bit of religion on
[2:39:56] him and still a desire for sin and he's
[2:40:00] the most miserable man in the whole wide
[2:40:02] world and he's never satisfied unless
[2:40:05] everybody around him is miserable
[2:40:08] because he knows too
[2:40:11] much he knows too much to enjoy the full
[2:40:15] benefit of his sin
[2:40:20] oh the testimonies I heard your amen
[2:40:22] sister Jennifer thank you uh the
[2:40:25] testimonies that I have heard through
[2:40:27] the years of following the Lord of
[2:40:29] people who had a touch of God in their
[2:40:32] life and didn't know no better so Friday
[2:40:34] night they go out with their friends
[2:40:36] they've been in the service had a touch
[2:40:38] of God in their life Friday night they
[2:40:40] go out with their friends to drink order
[2:40:42] the same thing they've always ordered
[2:40:43] getting ready to
[2:40:45] party and all of a sudden everybody's
[2:40:48] drinking up
[2:40:50] and the beer or or whatever is still
[2:40:53] sitting on the table and the tears start
[2:40:59] flowing and they I've heard this folks
[2:41:01] so many times I couldn't tell you how
[2:41:03] many times and people start coming back
[2:41:05] to the table what's wrong with you
[2:41:06] what's wrong with you why you're usually
[2:41:08] the one drunk first it's usually a
[2:41:11] contest to see if anybody can beat you
[2:41:13] getting out of your head I don't know
[2:41:16] what's wrong with me I don't know what's
[2:41:17] wrong with me all I know is I'm just not
[2:41:19] having a good
[2:41:20] time well just take a big sip of that
[2:41:23] and it'll help you toward a good time
[2:41:25] and I've even had them say I took a sip
[2:41:27] and it tasted like warm
[2:41:32] urine in my
[2:41:34] mouth because they had met something
[2:41:37] bigger something higher something more
[2:41:40] real something Eternal and it made them
[2:41:45] miserable not religious to keep on
[2:41:48] sinning miserable able until they got
[2:41:50] their full Deliverance but we're living
[2:41:52] in an hour right now especially in this
[2:41:54] watered down message
[2:41:57] environment where people can feel quite
[2:42:01] comfortable doing the same thing they've
[2:42:04] always done not realizing that the
[2:42:07] religious sinner is the worst of all
[2:42:09] that's the worst Jesus said so it's the
[2:42:12] worst
[2:42:13] Spirit now this week I'm
[2:42:18] closing may take me two or three minutes
[2:42:20] to do it but this
[2:42:23] week like last week I had a few battles
[2:42:29] in the
[2:42:30] night
[2:42:33] and really there would be no
[2:42:38] glory in describing any of it to
[2:42:42] you might even give the critics more
[2:42:46] ammunition and I can't explain
[2:42:50] why I experience these things and others
[2:42:55] along the way do but some don't I don't
[2:43:00] understand that I don't know why it has
[2:43:03] to be I know that Jesus Is the Victor
[2:43:07] and he has won the Victory and I don't
[2:43:09] know why we have to continue to war
[2:43:11] against Darkness but we do because it's
[2:43:14] our responsibility to appropriate the
[2:43:17] blood to appropriate the victory that
[2:43:20] Jesus has given to us and so many nights
[2:43:23] are wrestling matches with
[2:43:26] Darkness not because it would it
[2:43:29] particularly uh trying to take me out
[2:43:33] but but often times as an intercessor
[2:43:36] it's what is trying to steal something
[2:43:39] from someone
[2:43:40] else and so it becomes quite a match and
[2:43:43] I know there are others here who
[2:43:45] experience that God strengthen you and
[2:43:48] bless you and I'm just going to give you
[2:43:49] a piece of advice the best thing to do
[2:43:51] is not try to explain it because there's
[2:43:55] people sitting on your Pew right now
[2:43:57] that could never understand it but it
[2:43:59] just happens it's rare that I ever have
[2:44:03] to call for
[2:44:04] help but there were a couple of nights
[2:44:07] last week in Salt Lake City that the
[2:44:09] burden was so heavy and the Warfare so
[2:44:15] tremendous that I knew it was much
[2:44:18] bigger than I could do by myself out of
[2:44:22] my own
[2:44:24] environment 1,500 miles
[2:44:27] away and so I put that on the app
[2:44:31] because I wanted to know that others
[2:44:33] were praying it was the
[2:44:36] destiny of others that was
[2:44:39] being wared against in such a seductive
[2:44:44] way and all we can do is pray and plead
[2:44:48] the blood and ask for
[2:44:52] help and by the way I felt some help
[2:44:55] coming in here this
[2:44:56] morning you might have heard me say send
[2:44:59] them in bring them
[2:45:02] in I felt them I felt them coming I felt
[2:45:07] rein go back and catch you'll hear it I
[2:45:10] felt reinforcements coming in praise God
[2:45:14] this battle we we only know part of it
[2:45:19] lot of it's invisible isn't it I felt
[2:45:21] the strength of the Lord's host coming
[2:45:25] in God is jealous over
[2:45:28] you God is jealous over you he's jealous
[2:45:32] over your
[2:45:34] destiny he doesn't want you to have to
[2:45:37] take the fish
[2:45:40] ride he wants to pay your
[2:45:43] way I'll just give part of the line here
[2:45:46] he wants to pay your fair
[2:45:49] doesn't want you to have to pay
[2:45:54] but and so because of what I experienced
[2:45:58] even this week after coming home a
[2:46:00] couple of
[2:46:01] nights I I asked the Lord for
[2:46:06] answers uh why even talk about Darkness
[2:46:08] why even talk about the Demonic why even
[2:46:11] bring any attention to it and 2
[2:46:14] Corinthians 2:11 just jot this down so
[2:46:16] you'll know so that if you're friends
[2:46:18] from other places say why is brother
[2:46:19] Shelly always talking about demons and
[2:46:22] battling spirits and so forth please
[2:46:24] understand this is the reason why Les
[2:46:27] Satan should get an advantage of
[2:46:31] us for we are
[2:46:35] not we're not ignorant of his devices we
[2:46:38] know how he works because we've fought
[2:46:41] him
[2:46:41] before and we'll fight him
[2:46:44] again and the Lord dealt with me and he
[2:46:47] gave me some Revelation to share with
[2:46:48] with you and I won't be able to get to
[2:46:50] the meat of it now but I'll just give
[2:46:53] you the I'll just gloss the
[2:46:56] top he identified to me in the word
[2:47:01] three
[2:47:02] spirits that we must contend with in
[2:47:06] this season of
[2:47:08] proving we're being
[2:47:10] proven you you can call it testing
[2:47:13] tested tried but we're being
[2:47:17] proven God is
[2:47:20] seeing if his investment in us has
[2:47:24] brought us any maturity or not you
[2:47:28] understand and these
[2:47:30] three I want to say spirits but I I
[2:47:33] should probably say uh that they are
[2:47:36] more like Legions of spirits or groups
[2:47:39] of spirits that are certainly assigned
[2:47:43] against the last day
[2:47:44] bride and I want you to be aware of them
[2:47:47] because we won't have time to go over
[2:47:48] very deeply with them now it's closing
[2:47:50] time number one seducing Spirits which
[2:47:55] very often are lying
[2:48:01] Spirits they're
[2:48:04] Christians who have a hard time telling
[2:48:07] the
[2:48:09] truth and every time you over ellish I
[2:48:14] want to make sure you're listening to
[2:48:16] me I know it's I know you're tired
[2:48:19] I understand that I I I
[2:48:24] do totally understand
[2:48:27] it if you are a person who loses the
[2:48:32] grasp of Truth when you're
[2:48:35] talking because you often
[2:48:39] embellish
[2:48:41] exaggerate or
[2:48:45] spin we only find and
[2:48:50] listen no one is immune brother brandham
[2:48:54] had to do battle with the spirit of
[2:48:55] exaggeration he said
[2:48:58] so he said I I have a tendency to
[2:49:02] exaggerate that's big boy got
[2:49:05] quiet you you you mean you rather think
[2:49:08] that you're the only one that had a
[2:49:10] battle I like it when I can identify
[2:49:12] that he had a battle and the Lord even
[2:49:15] had to battle with these
[2:49:17] things and uh you have to deal with it
[2:49:20] and if you don't if you if you uh dress
[2:49:25] up the
[2:49:26] truth if you spin the truth so that it
[2:49:31] makes you look
[2:49:33] better now if it really was that way it
[2:49:35] really was that way but if you're
[2:49:38] turning it around a little bit because
[2:49:42] you want to make yourself look a little
[2:49:45] cleaner o somebody's hearing me now
[2:49:49] what you don't realize is by doing that
[2:49:52] you are inviting a lying
[2:49:56] Spirit into your life it's a
[2:50:02] lie now the world will say there are
[2:50:06] black lies and white lies and gray lies
[2:50:09] and purple lies and pink
[2:50:13] lies but since the devil is identified
[2:50:17] as the father of all all
[2:50:19] lies I have to believe they all come
[2:50:22] from him so I don't believe there are
[2:50:25] different colors but if you believe
[2:50:26] there's different colors to your
[2:50:32] lying you just need to know the author
[2:50:35] of it all pink yellow red purple white
[2:50:39] black exaggeration whatever is the devil
[2:50:44] and it may look innocent
[2:50:48] tricks and pranks
[2:50:51] and when I was going through such a dark
[2:50:54] time in my life with my
[2:50:56] nerves I was having hideous anxiety
[2:51:01] attacks and I didn't want to leave the
[2:51:04] house I didn't want to be with
[2:51:06] people and uh eventually gave into to my
[2:51:10] mother's wishes and was given a
[2:51:13] medication which clearly could have
[2:51:17] taken me out I'm telling you the effects
[2:51:22] of that
[2:51:23] medication could have easily taken me
[2:51:27] out until I decided that the side
[2:51:30] effects were worse than the anxiety I'm
[2:51:34] just telling you my story if you want to
[2:51:36] know the name of the drug I can tell you
[2:51:39] later did it help you with your nerves
[2:51:41] and anxiety a little bit well it
[2:51:43] actually did it was under a spiritual
[2:51:45] attack and if you're under a spiritual
[2:51:48] attack medication is only going to help
[2:51:50] you so much anyway if it's a spiritual
[2:51:53] attack it's got to be one in the
[2:51:56] spirit spiritual battle's got to be one
[2:51:59] in the interesting isn't it but anyway
[2:52:02] yes it took the edge off but what it
[2:52:05] began to do in my life was physical
[2:52:08] awful physical and uh yeah physical side
[2:52:13] effects and it began to try to lower my
[2:52:17] inhibition
[2:52:20] and I found myself thinking and tempted
[2:52:24] to things that I had never thought about
[2:52:26] or and I kept saying to the Lord how
[2:52:28] would you allow this why would you allow
[2:52:31] the enemy to put something in my head
[2:52:33] that's never been in my head before and
[2:52:36] and after a lot of praying the Lord
[2:52:38] began to talk to me and let me know that
[2:52:40] the root of this problem now was the
[2:52:42] medication and I was strongly urged by
[2:52:46] the doctor not to quitt it cold turkey
[2:52:49] but I didn't want to spend another
[2:52:53] day wanting to run out and do something
[2:52:56] thank God that I had enough of the Holy
[2:52:59] Ghost to keep me or I would have run out
[2:53:03] and done the things that the enemy was
[2:53:04] putting in my head because I didn't feel
[2:53:06] the same guilt or the same conviction or
[2:53:09] the same you know strength it wasn't
[2:53:12] there and if you can be altered that way
[2:53:15] medically that ought to put a little bit
[2:53:17] of a stirring everybody in the
[2:53:21] house only God helped me through and
[2:53:23] your prayers and your fasting and your
[2:53:26] and and my rocking chair on the front
[2:53:28] porch and my
[2:53:30] songs singing you you remember the song
[2:53:33] that brought me through some through the
[2:53:36] water some through the
[2:53:40] flood some through the fire but all
[2:53:44] through the blood that's what brought me
[2:53:47] through just singing it over my mind and
[2:53:51] head so tormented I thought I was going
[2:53:53] to die and I just start singing that
[2:53:56] song and one by one those Spirits would
[2:53:58] have to lift and and leave we open up
[2:54:02] our lives to lying Spirits when we
[2:54:08] exaggerate or
[2:54:10] spin the
[2:54:12] truth it starts off with a husband and
[2:54:15] his wife or a wife and her husband
[2:54:20] the best thing to do brother sister is
[2:54:23] tell the truth and face the
[2:54:26] music get that out of the
[2:54:30] way don't hide the bag the shopping bags
[2:54:34] in the
[2:54:39] closet or God might let you come who
[2:54:42] might show you some Spirit travel I
[2:54:45] better not mention this on the on the on
[2:54:47] the Stream but God let me see he let me
[2:54:50] take a peek one time in my own bedroom
[2:54:53] on the other side of the world I said to
[2:54:55] my wife on the phone what were all those
[2:54:57] shopping bags over there just joking and
[2:55:00] and she was wondering how in the world I
[2:55:02] knew well anyway we never had that
[2:55:05] problem we never hit it but if that's a
[2:55:09] problem don't hide it just tell him I
[2:55:12] did
[2:55:15] it if he beats you beat him back
[2:55:21] but don't let the
[2:55:23] enemy gray the
[2:55:26] truth because every time you spin
[2:55:33] it you don't have to tell me it was on
[2:55:38] sale I don't care if you bought it you
[2:55:41] work for the money you spent it you
[2:55:43] don't tell me how much money you saved
[2:55:46] me
[2:55:48] don't start that if you start that
[2:55:51] you're opening up your
[2:55:54] life because it won't just be a Twist or
[2:55:57] an
[2:55:58] exaggeration it'll become an open lie
[2:56:01] ballf face lie I am convinced that there
[2:56:04] are people who lie without being aware
[2:56:08] that they are lying because they have
[2:56:10] lost control of what comes out of their
[2:56:15] mouth now that doesn't mean anything
[2:56:18] anything to the world out there it
[2:56:19] doesn't mean anything to the church out
[2:56:21] there but I tell you if this is a spirit
[2:56:23] that the enemy wants to use to trip the
[2:56:25] bride we better know it because that
[2:56:29] little twist of the truth doesn't stop
[2:56:31] there it begins to to
[2:56:35] seduce and to
[2:56:38] deceive and we want to be aware the
[2:56:41] second thing that was highlighted to me
[2:56:44] in the word that we were going to have
[2:56:46] to contend with in this season of of
[2:56:48] proving is religious
[2:56:50] spirits and I just read to you where he
[2:56:53] said the religious Center was the worst
[2:56:54] center of all a religious spirit because
[2:56:58] in the family of religious Spirits comes
[2:57:02] delusions and someone can be under a
[2:57:06] delusion and have no idea they have
[2:57:10] absolutely no idea that what they're
[2:57:13] saying is a
[2:57:16] delusion it just comes out out of their
[2:57:18] mouth they don't even know how opposite
[2:57:22] of reality it really
[2:57:25] is and that's why you must as
[2:57:29] Believers we must be careful uh and we
[2:57:33] must be
[2:57:36] mindful when we say the Lord led me the
[2:57:41] Lord spoke to me the Lord directed me
[2:57:46] the Lord moved me
[2:57:49] we should be extremely careful when we
[2:57:53] say that because if we are falling under
[2:57:56] the attack of a religious type Spirit we
[2:58:00] can come into a place of delusion where
[2:58:03] we
[2:58:06] confuse the
[2:58:11] voices I don't believe the Bride Can
[2:58:13] ultimately be
[2:58:15] deceived but I believe the bride can be
[2:58:17] a
[2:58:18] attacked with delusional Spirits with
[2:58:22] religious spirits that will make you
[2:58:26] think I've had them come and sit in my
[2:58:29] office and say to me God told me to
[2:58:33] marry this
[2:58:35] woman and what do I say all I can say to
[2:58:39] you brother is this if God told you to
[2:58:42] marry this woman he has gone against his
[2:58:45] own
[2:58:46] word and he's going to be held
[2:58:48] accountable Mighty almighty God is going
[2:58:51] to have to give an account to gospel
[2:58:54] preachers who have preached the word all
[2:58:57] these years that God was not a
[2:59:01] lie somewhere somehow he's going to have
[2:59:04] to straighten it out with
[2:59:06] us you can't reason with people sometime
[2:59:10] when they feel like God has told them
[2:59:12] something or God is leading them and
[2:59:14] that's the saddest part the saddest part
[2:59:17] about it
[2:59:18] it would be better for you and I to say
[2:59:21] I feel this this is what I want to do
[2:59:24] this is what I think I should
[2:59:27] say it it it would be easier and better
[2:59:31] and safer to say that than to come to a
[2:59:34] place where we we confuse the voices
[2:59:36] just a little bit and we're just and and
[2:59:38] you know what the reality is no one is
[2:59:41] setting out to to be
[2:59:43] wrong it's simply a confusion that the
[2:59:47] enemy will pour on you like a bucket of
[2:59:50] water it's the spirit of the age it's
[2:59:53] part of the Babylonian spirit and it's a
[2:59:55] spirit of chaos and confusion and I'm
[2:59:58] telling you what you can be the last to
[3:00:03] realize I've been around you keep saying
[3:00:06] that I
[3:00:07] know I've been around long enough to to
[3:00:10] know that there are many people who
[3:00:13] finally break
[3:00:15] out and they say I was
[3:00:19] wrong I thought that I was doing exactly
[3:00:22] what God Said now I said to this
[3:00:25] particular brother who comes to my mind
[3:00:27] I said well brother I don't see how in
[3:00:29] my I don't see how in the my whole life
[3:00:32] I just cannot grasp how that can work
[3:00:35] and guess what it
[3:00:38] didn't it can't under those
[3:00:42] circumstances do what you want to do and
[3:00:46] don't even drag God God in
[3:00:49] [Applause]
[3:00:50] it but if you're going to put God in it
[3:00:54] make sure that you're not under a
[3:00:56] religious spirit
[3:00:59] right all of us every one of us can fall
[3:01:03] under that
[3:01:05] influence my wife grew up under a bit of
[3:01:09] that religious spirit type thing the
[3:01:14] heart of her parents was pure pure I
[3:01:18] know her dad is listening to this his
[3:01:21] heart was pure and it was right but the
[3:01:25] messages that he sent were
[3:01:29] confusing and that confusion and then
[3:01:32] blaming the Lord for your confusion can
[3:01:36] become a generational thing and it has
[3:01:39] to be broken give us an example well a
[3:01:43] Revival would come up and our brother
[3:01:45] would fall under conviction for having
[3:01:47] the television
[3:01:48] so he would go home and unplug it and
[3:01:50] throw the thing out the door and when
[3:01:52] that when the fervor of that Revival
[3:01:54] would
[3:01:55] lift he would realize that he wanted to
[3:01:58] see the news or he wanted to see Star
[3:02:01] Trek I'm using him as an example not to
[3:02:05] dishonor or disrespect him but to tell
[3:02:07] you how you've got to recognize these
[3:02:09] things coming on in your life and the
[3:02:11] children are just sitting there is it
[3:02:12] wrong or not wrong is it right or not
[3:02:14] right is this what we're supposed to do
[3:02:16] is this required for the Rapture or is
[3:02:18] it not required for the Rapture so it'd
[3:02:19] be better to leave God out of it allog
[3:02:21] together and just say look I've got a
[3:02:24] problem I really like uh space
[3:02:30] fantasy than to
[3:02:32] say God said it was wrong God said it's
[3:02:35] okay God said it was wrong God said it's
[3:02:37] okay and that is what makes this thing
[3:02:39] religious when we have to use religious
[3:02:42] terminology to
[3:02:44] justify what sometimes can just be
[3:02:47] emotional ter turmoil anybody listening
[3:02:49] to your preacher how do you come up with
[3:02:52] these
[3:02:53] things I've been
[3:02:56] around and the last is familiar
[3:03:00] spirits and familiar spirits are
[3:03:03] assigned to Generations like we were
[3:03:05] talking about generational iniquity
[3:03:07] they're assigned to
[3:03:09] generations and those familiar spirits
[3:03:11] can operate
[3:03:13] like uh
[3:03:16] sorcery which
[3:03:18] witchcraft but they don't have to
[3:03:21] operate in the realm of Witchcraft
[3:03:23] because technically any demonic spirit
[3:03:27] that you become so familiar
[3:03:32] with that you just keep repeating the
[3:03:36] behavior under the influence of this
[3:03:39] spirit it's almost like people making
[3:03:42] buddies with demonic spirits and they
[3:03:45] become so familiar
[3:03:48] and that is one of the reasons why we
[3:03:50] have to pray over our homes and we have
[3:03:53] to pray over our
[3:03:56] pets we have to pray over our children
[3:03:59] especially we have to pray over what we
[3:04:01] put them down in front
[3:04:05] of we have to be concerned about their
[3:04:08] cartoons let's see if we can get a
[3:04:10] little help here we got to be concerned
[3:04:13] about all of it because the enemy is
[3:04:15] looking for an doorway yes now he's out
[3:04:19] there bothering other people with you
[3:04:21] know uh sex and drugs and and what all
[3:04:25] else and that's not to say that none of
[3:04:27] you ever struggle in those areas but
[3:04:30] he's operating a little differently
[3:04:31] against the elect than he is against
[3:04:34] those who could care
[3:04:36] less and these were the three things
[3:04:38] that uh he helped me and I want to close
[3:04:40] with this and I'm not even going to read
[3:04:41] the quote but you look at being led of
[3:04:44] the Holy Spirit Minneapolis Minnesota
[3:04:47] because I want you all to this is how I
[3:04:49] wanted to end today I wanted to to make
[3:04:52] sure that you understand I want to be
[3:04:54] much farther along than I am but I
[3:04:56] wanted you to be sure to understand that
[3:05:00] there is a clear difference in being
[3:05:03] demon
[3:05:05] possessed and Demon
[3:05:09] oppressed now brother brandom is clear
[3:05:12] on the
[3:05:13] subject and the scripture helps us to
[3:05:16] understand
[3:05:18] that
[3:05:19] so when when we say if I should ever say
[3:05:22] to you have I ever said to you don't
[3:05:26] answer have you ever come to me and have
[3:05:28] I ever said to you that's a
[3:05:32] spirit if I have please understand I
[3:05:35] didn't mean necessarily that you were
[3:05:38] demonic that you were demon
[3:05:43] possessed brother brandham discerned
[3:05:46] often times
[3:05:48] that there was a nervousness in
[3:05:52] people he claimed his own
[3:05:55] nervousness as a tendency toward the
[3:05:59] spiritual and I believe
[3:06:01] it but he also recognize that there is
[3:06:04] another kind of
[3:06:06] nervousness and I've often noticed that
[3:06:09] when preachers are making the
[3:06:11] quotes about a nervous person being a
[3:06:13] spiritual person they miss the fact that
[3:06:17] there's another reason for being
[3:06:21] nervous and he tells us that a person
[3:06:25] can be nervous because they're being
[3:06:30] oppressed by a demon
[3:06:33] spirit and and and the the the body's
[3:06:36] reaction the emotional reaction to a
[3:06:39] spirit trying to influence our life is
[3:06:42] that we can become physically
[3:06:44] nervous now I maintain
[3:06:48] that if you respond negatively that way
[3:06:51] in
[3:06:52] nervousness it probably is an indication
[3:06:55] that you were born to have a deeper
[3:06:59] spiritual connection with God and the
[3:07:02] enemy is trying to hijack
[3:07:05] that uh you know anyone with with a gift
[3:07:08] in their life or a special calling of
[3:07:10] some kind whether it is music or
[3:07:12] preaching or or or Administration or
[3:07:14] whatever it is the enemy is going to do
[3:07:17] do everything he can to cross the
[3:07:19] signals in their life and so if they are
[3:07:22] spiritually sensitive to the light
[3:07:24] they're often also sensitive to the dark
[3:07:27] and I wish we could
[3:07:29] choose but we don't get the choice what
[3:07:33] we want to be able to do is operate in
[3:07:35] the Discerning of spirits we want to be
[3:07:37] able to know is this nervousness and
[3:07:41] anxiety because I am moving out of God's
[3:07:44] will or because I'm trying to make a
[3:07:46] move into God 's will and the only way
[3:07:49] we can do that is follow it down through
[3:07:51] the word we don't have to end up in
[3:07:54] confusion when we've got the absolute
[3:07:56] amen musicians are coming and we're
[3:07:59] standing it's 2:00 it's
[3:08:02] 2:04 we could just say we don't have
[3:08:05] time to worship and
[3:08:06] leave but I'm not going to do that some
[3:08:10] have already told me that they had an
[3:08:12] appointment and had to be leaving about
[3:08:13] two and I excuse you when you need to
[3:08:16] leave and understand
[3:08:19] 1,000% but for the rest of us we want to
[3:08:23] know that anything this standing between
[3:08:27] us and our first
[3:08:29] love is dealt
[3:08:31] with I want you to remember this I'm
[3:08:34] giving you one more very serious piece
[3:08:38] of
[3:08:40] instruction Jesus said to
[3:08:43] Peter Satan hath desired
[3:08:48] to sift you as sweet but I have prayed
[3:08:51] for
[3:08:53] you that your strength fail
[3:08:58] not and when thou
[3:09:02] art
[3:09:04] converted strengthen the
[3:09:08] brethren in this hour this late hour we
[3:09:13] need to be careful with our
[3:09:16] Mercy we we need to be careful with our
[3:09:20] benevolence we need to be careful with
[3:09:23] our
[3:09:24] sharing and with our
[3:09:27] giving of ourselves our time our
[3:09:30] finances sir we need to be careful that
[3:09:34] we're not extending unsanctified Mercy
[3:09:39] sir by turning our head when we need to
[3:09:42] be on our prayer
[3:09:43] bones we need to make sure that we are
[3:09:46] Spirit spiritually
[3:09:48] fit and Holy Ghost sealed filled and
[3:09:53] sealed up yes sir before we spend an
[3:09:56] enormous amount of time trying to help
[3:09:59] other people order their
[3:10:03] steps the Bible tells us the blind can't
[3:10:07] lead the
[3:10:10] blind and one of the problems that
[3:10:13] people get into in an in an hour like
[3:10:14] this is they start leaning on other
[3:10:17] sources for their
[3:10:21] Direction now you need a revelation of
[3:10:24] who your leadership is yes sir and when
[3:10:27] you get that uh
[3:10:29] Revelation and remember it can be for a
[3:10:33] season but when you get a revelation of
[3:10:35] who that leadership is you ought to
[3:10:38] listen that's right does that sound
[3:10:42] controlling well I have no way of
[3:10:44] forcing you to listen but you ought to
[3:10:46] listen
[3:10:50] yes because it becomes increasingly hard
[3:10:54] for your leadership to pray you
[3:10:59] out of a situation that you are
[3:11:04] in because you failed to listen to Godly
[3:11:09] counsel now I know that may sound a bit
[3:11:11] controlling but there's a reason why God
[3:11:15] gives us spiritual leadership
[3:11:18] in the Bible it's established in the
[3:11:20] Bible and there's a reason why he does
[3:11:23] that and if you would take foot now that
[3:11:25] but I but brother shy I want you to
[3:11:27] counsel me and I want you to do this and
[3:11:29] I want you to do that I've told you
[3:11:30] before I'll tell you again I'm not a
[3:11:32] professional
[3:11:35] counselor that's not my my gift I'm not
[3:11:38] a professional
[3:11:40] counselor you've got to be willing to
[3:11:42] listen for the voice of the spirit
[3:11:45] because he'll speak to you through those
[3:11:47] you you have confidence in even your
[3:11:49] friends in the church and the in the
[3:11:51] fellowship he'll speak to you through
[3:11:53] them and you've got to be able to
[3:11:54] discern is this them trying to give me
[3:11:57] advice or is this the Holy
[3:12:00] Spirit and it's not always easy to know
[3:12:02] the
[3:12:03] difference and so we got to walk a very
[3:12:05] soft walk and that's why when we see
[3:12:08] others struggling we've got to be very
[3:12:11] careful how we're helping them up if our
[3:12:15] own life is not set in spiritual order
[3:12:19] and submitted to spiritual
[3:12:22] leadership because that becomes your
[3:12:24] covering and protection when you start
[3:12:26] speaking into someone else's life you
[3:12:28] want to know right and that's why and
[3:12:32] and this is not even really what I'm
[3:12:33] referring to but that's why I so respect
[3:12:37] someone when they come to me and say
[3:12:39] look someone has come and asked this
[3:12:41] question and here's what I'm going to
[3:12:43] answer this is what I feel to answer but
[3:12:44] I just want to make sure that you're
[3:12:46] aware of the fact
[3:12:47] that that I'm doing I appreciate that so
[3:12:50] much because again that's not what I'm
[3:12:52] referring to in the moment but that
[3:12:54] gives that person that individual a
[3:12:58] protection because it means that they're
[3:13:00] not stepping out from under their
[3:13:01] authority to use Authority in someone
[3:13:04] else's life brother the best thing you
[3:13:07] can do for
[3:13:08] me is the best thing you can do for the
[3:13:11] one next to you on the Pew and that's
[3:13:14] pray for them call their name out out
[3:13:17] before the Lord and pray that God will
[3:13:20] raise up a holy boldness the boldness of
[3:13:22] a lion in their lungs that they will not
[3:13:25] only declare the goodness of God and the
[3:13:28] faithfulness of God but that they will
[3:13:30] have boldness to speak their own destiny
[3:13:32] purpose right out of their mouth I am an
[3:13:35] overcomer I am a bone who is finding his
[3:13:40] bone I am one and when all my bones get
[3:13:43] together he's going to come like he did
[3:13:45] in ezekiel's vision he's going to
[3:13:48] Breathe on Me Hallelujah and what was
[3:13:52] just a valley of bleached bones a few
[3:13:55] moments ago will now become a mighty
[3:13:58] exceeding Army standing on its
[3:14:02] feet ready to do the work of the kingdom
[3:14:05] of God isn't the Lord good

[3:37:04] Bibles and the heathens in the room are
[3:37:07] just watching that they don't know what
[3:37:09] to do and if if they if we saw them
[3:37:11] looking they would they would act like
[3:37:13] they weren't looking as these children
[3:37:15] children begin to tell their scriptures

[3:37:21] uh Caleb John otherwise known as John
