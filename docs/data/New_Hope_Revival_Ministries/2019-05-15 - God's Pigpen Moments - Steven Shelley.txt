TRANSCRIPT
========================================
if a pigpen is going to make the difference god get them to the Pigpen as quickly as possible if God has chosen a pigpen for my prodigal and he's chosen away to get them back to him the quicker they get to the school of surrender the quicker they get to the school I mean I'd choose one with comfortable seats and air conditioning and doting loving nurses but sometimes God said they've been spoiled enough now they need to see what happens when you make dumb choices that take you out of fellowship with God there's a price to be paid and I can't always pay their gambling debt or their drug debt I can't always get between them and their problem because sometimes while I'm trying to get between them and their problem I'm actually getting between them and the god who's passionately chasing them down because he wants them as his own if they can just know God in an intimate and personal and satisfying relationship how they got there it's only a part of their story but how many of you know an eternity the Pigpen won't matter every person has to have their own God encounter every person has to have their own pillar of fire experience everybody's got to have their own new birth everybody's got to have a taste of that original manner you can do it for your wife you can do it for your husband you can't do it for your children whether they're in or out you can't do it for your neighbor but I'm telling you you can trust mama you can trust God daddy you can trust God it may look black it may look dark and it may look impossible but I want you to know impossibility is an opportunity if a pigpen is going to make the difference God get them to the Pigpen as quickly as possible
