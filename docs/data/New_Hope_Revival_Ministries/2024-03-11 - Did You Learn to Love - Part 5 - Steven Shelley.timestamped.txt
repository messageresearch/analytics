[1:12:53] don't let it linger there he said get it
[1:12:56] out of
[1:13:00] there right then how many of you know if
[1:13:03] you leave it to grow it'll grow it won't
[1:13:06] die on its own you have to take the
[1:13:09] grubbing hoe of the word and cut out
[1:13:11] every little part of the
[1:13:13] root make sure you don't leave any in
[1:13:16] there or it'll Sprout again he said then

[1:13:22] see
[1:13:24] don't you let that happen some slick
[1:13:27] tongue fella might come along and try to
[1:13:30] take you away from it you think they
[1:13:33] could talk Moses out of the presence of
[1:13:35] God where he had stood there and seen it
[1:13:38] no sir no do you hear what he's talking
[1:13:41] about don't ever let anybody talk you
[1:13:44] out of the presence of
[1:13:46] Goden you hold on to that yes he said we
[1:13:51] don't take from it or add to it just
[1:13:53] keep keep it the way the Lord said we
[1:13:55] don't want no denomination we don't want
[1:13:58] no
[1:13:59] organizations we don't want no malice we
[1:14:02] don't want no Strife we want God and he
[1:14:07] is the
[1:14:09] word we want to serve the Lord in
[1:14:14] humility we want to love without
[1:14:18] dissimulation in the message enticing
[1:14:21] Spirits brother ad him said in paragraph
[1:14:25] 161 Jesus in his prayer said father I
[1:14:30] sanctify
[1:14:32] myself Jesus becomes Sanctified to the
[1:14:35] church he could have gotten married but
[1:14:38] he didn't do it he becomes Sanctified
[1:14:41] that means set apart he said sanctify
[1:14:45] them Father through the truth Thy word
[1:14:49] is the truth do you believe that he said
[1:14:53] now let's lay aside every
[1:14:57] weight he said you got a temper you got
[1:15:00] something about you makes you talk when
[1:15:03] you ought not to
[1:15:12] talk oh God he said lay it there now lay
[1:15:17] it there now watch this watch the fire
[1:15:22] of the altar
[1:15:23] come down and take it
[1:15:27] away I wonder who might lay your temper
[1:15:30] on the altar of God today and let his
[1:15:34] fire fall Among Us and lick it up
[1:15:37] consume it so that it troubles you no
[1:15:40] more I I wonder who here might talk when
[1:15:43] they ought to be quiet and you'd like to
[1:15:46] lay that on the altar today and let the
[1:15:48] fire of God come and take it away he
[1:15:51] said watch the love of
[1:15:54] God the fiery love of God lick it up I
[1:16:01] like that he said watch all that old
[1:16:04] selfishness the way you've been talking
[1:16:06] to your
[1:16:13] wife we don't want to
[1:16:15] rush we want it to soak in among us the
[1:16:19] way you've been talking to your
[1:16:22] husband

[1:16:33] other but I I I heard sister Beth she
[1:16:36] got hers
[1:16:38] in on your husband part she got she's
[1:16:41] not the only one that ought to do it
[1:16:44] you've been talking to your husband the
[1:16:46] way you've been talking to your
[1:16:50] neighbor I I I gave you a chance to amen
[1:16:52] while you could cuz now it's getting
[1:16:56] rough you say well I've been talking to
[1:16:59] my husband right I've been talking to my
[1:17:00] wife right I treat my neighbor right oh
[1:17:02] that's Grand but wait he didn't stop
[1:17:05] there he said the way you've talked
[1:17:07] about the people in the
[1:17:12] church lay it on the altar this morning
[1:17:15] and the fire of God will come down and
[1:17:18] take it right away and listen and
[1:17:21] divine love
[1:17:25] Divine love will burn in its
[1:17:30] place I read that this morning because I
[1:17:33] believe every one of us would desire
[1:17:35] that in our
[1:17:37] lives that we could lay it on the altar
[1:17:41] today and divine love the fiery love of
[1:17:44] God come and burn out the chaff and let
[1:17:48] Divine love come and occupy the space
[1:17:52] where this other stuff has been he goes
[1:17:55] on to say you've got sickness lay it on
[1:17:59] the altar Lord here it is create in me a
[1:18:06] clean
[1:18:08] Spirit create in me a healing power see
[1:18:13] what God will do God will do it this
[1:18:19] morning I don't know about you but I
[1:18:21] like that
[1:18:23] I want us to go to Romans chapter
[1:18:27] 5 uh Elias just walk right up here and
[1:18:30] get that microphone for me would would
[1:18:32] you I I've got a lot of reading to do
[1:18:36] and it's not that I am too good to do
[1:18:39] all the reading but it kind of takes my
[1:18:42] voice and my breath to do it all and you
[1:18:46] do so well so be
[1:18:49] ready therefore being justified
[1:18:53] by faith this is Romans 5 verse 1- 11 we
[1:18:59] have peace with God through our Lord
[1:19:03] Jesus Christ listen carefully by whom
[1:19:07] also we have access by faith into this
[1:19:11] grace wherein we stand and
[1:19:16] rejoice in Hope of the glory of God and
[1:19:22] not only so but we glory in
[1:19:27] tribulations
[1:19:32] also that means we praise we enter into
[1:19:37] the spirit we enter into his presence
[1:19:41] even in the midst of
[1:19:43] tribulations are you with
[1:19:45] me knowing that
[1:19:48] tribulation worketh patience so those of
[1:19:53] you who feel that it is really Christian
[1:19:56] to pray for
[1:19:59] patience please understand that you are
[1:20:02] praying for
[1:20:03] tribulation because the and you know
[1:20:05] what that's one thing you don't have to
[1:20:06] pray for that's right sir cuz you're
[1:20:09] going to get it
[1:20:10] anyhow what we need to pray is that the
[1:20:13] tribulation we're going through will
[1:20:16] accomplish everything that God has
[1:20:18] allowed it for so that it doesn't become
[1:20:22] way wasted trouble or wasted tribulation
[1:20:26] but so that it really works something in
[1:20:28] us including patience and that's one
[1:20:32] thing you're going to need if you serve
[1:20:34] the Lord you're going to need patience
[1:20:36] because he'll say
[1:20:38] soon and it'll be 700
[1:20:41] years so you want patience and patience
[1:20:46] experience and experience
[1:20:50] hope every bit of it has a purpose
[1:20:53] and hope maketh not ashamed now listen
[1:20:58] because the love of God is shed abroad
[1:21:04] multiplied that's what the word means
[1:21:07] multiplied in our
[1:21:09] hearts the love of God is Multiplied in
[1:21:13] our hearts by the Holy
[1:21:16] Ghost which is given unto us now I want
[1:21:20] you to know many many times in the
[1:21:23] message of the hour brother brandom is
[1:21:26] connecting the Holy Ghost with Divine
[1:21:30] love that's right and here the scripture
[1:21:33] is connecting the two because the love
[1:21:36] of God is shed abroad it is Multiplied
[1:21:39] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost so if we
[1:21:42] need more
[1:21:46] love we need more Holy
[1:21:50] Ghost amen amen yes did you know if we
[1:21:54] pray for more faith we're praying for
[1:21:56] more love brother Bram said so we're
[1:22:00] praying for more love did you know we're
[1:22:02] also praying for more faith because
[1:22:04] faith and love work by the holy spirit
[1:22:08] so here the Holy Ghost has multiplied
[1:22:11] the love of God in our hearts which is a
[1:22:13] gift it is a gift we can't earn it we
[1:22:17] can't create it we can't manufacture it
[1:22:21] we can't work it up so if we want to
[1:22:23] have more love of God in our lives we've
[1:22:25] got to have more Holy Ghost for when we
[1:22:28] were yet without Strength In Due Time
[1:22:32] Christ died for the
[1:22:35] ungodly they that are whole need not a
[1:22:38] physician he died for the ungodly for
[1:22:41] scarcely for a righteous man will one
[1:22:44] die yet per adventure for a good man
[1:22:47] some would even dare to die but God
[1:22:52] committ ended his love toward us in that
[1:22:55] while we were yet
[1:22:58] sinners Christ
[1:23:02] died us for us are you following that
[1:23:06] much more than being now Justified
[1:23:11] how by the washing of his blood we shall
[1:23:15] be saved from wrath not through good
[1:23:21] works through
[1:23:23] him not through our own
[1:23:26] righteousness but through inherited
[1:23:29] righteousness we have I I I I dreamed
[1:23:33] all through the night last night so many
[1:23:36] different dreams and in one of the
[1:23:39] different dreams one of the different
[1:23:41] sequences in a dream I was talking to
[1:23:44] some brethren about the Holy
[1:23:46] Ghost and I was talking to them about
[1:23:50] pressing all the way in
[1:23:53] until you have all of the manifestations
[1:23:56] of the holy spirit in your life and I
[1:23:58] told those Brethren including speaking
[1:24:01] in
[1:24:02] tongues it has a
[1:24:05] place I said it still has a
[1:24:09] place and I was saying that to those
[1:24:12] Brethren and then I began to talk to
[1:24:14] some others about the Divine
[1:24:18] exchange and I said do you see the
[1:24:20] Divine Exchange he gave us his life in
[1:24:25] exchange for ours who believes you got
[1:24:28] the best end of the bargain there and
[1:24:31] then he takes our effort a a a as an
[1:24:35] exchange for his
[1:24:37] righteousness he said even the best you
[1:24:39] can do is filthy rags and it leaves the
[1:24:42] tables full of vomit but I'm not going
[1:24:45] to leave you naked Hallelujah I'm not
[1:24:48] going to leave you in
[1:24:49] unrighteousness I'm going to take what
[1:24:52] little bit you've got and I'm going to
[1:24:54] dress you in the righteousness of my
[1:24:57] word hallelujah so that you will be
[1:24:59] acceptable in my sight all of this works
[1:25:03] by the Holy Ghost all of this works by
[1:25:06] love much more then being now justified
[1:25:09] by his blood we shall be saved from
[1:25:12] wrath not not apart from him but through
[1:25:16] him for when for if when we were enemies
[1:25:20] we were reconciled to God by the death
[1:25:24] of his son much more being reconciled we
[1:25:28] shall be saved by his life we are
[1:25:33] reconciled to God by his death we are
[1:25:36] not saved by death we are saved by his
[1:25:40] life it is the grace that God has given
[1:25:44] us he said and not only so but also joy
[1:25:48] in God how many of you know what it
[1:25:51] means to to Joy in God to rejoice in him
[1:25:57] yes
[1:25:59] yes somebody said well I just want to be
[1:26:02] very reverent well I appreciate
[1:26:04] reverence whenever I can see it I
[1:26:07] appreciate that but there's a time to
[1:26:09] Joy in the Lord there's a time to
[1:26:12] Rejoice he said rejoice and again I say
[1:26:16] unto
[1:26:17] you it's not enough to Rejoice once he
[1:26:21] said now come back and do it all over
[1:26:23] again because you're going to need that
[1:26:26] joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:30] by whom we have now received the
[1:26:33] atonement do you believe you have in a
[1:26:36] message called healing line
[1:26:39] 53 he said listen here's a lovely
[1:26:44] thing as you serve one
[1:26:49] another I'm just going to I'm know I am
[1:26:52] am going to take my
[1:26:54] time I'm not going to rush I want you to
[1:26:57] hear
[1:27:00] it he said as you serve one
[1:27:04] another you're serving
[1:27:07] God see the love of God is in every
[1:27:12] Christian heart and be kind I want you
[1:27:15] to say that with me be
[1:27:19] kind to one another
[1:27:22] forgive one another Well I'm going to
[1:27:25] forgive him when he ask you know what
[1:27:28] that's not real forgiveness that's a
[1:27:30] manufactured imitation if somebody has
[1:27:33] to ask you to forgive them before you
[1:27:35] produce any forgiveness you're just
[1:27:38] you're just kind of coming up with
[1:27:39] something and and and I don't I want you
[1:27:42] to know we don't need something we can
[1:27:43] just make up on our own we need the
[1:27:46] grace of God to be present in our lives
[1:27:48] and we need to forgive before we're
[1:27:51] asked but because we don't want anything
[1:27:53] to encumber us or to wait us down as we
[1:27:56] run toward the prize forgive one another
[1:27:59] he said if you don't see the scriptures
[1:28:02] just alike I wish everybody who claims
[1:28:06] to believe this message could hear this
[1:28:09] quotation and do something about it this
[1:28:12] morning because there are too many
[1:28:14] divisions among all of those who believe
[1:28:17] they have the whole truth if you don't
[1:28:20] see the scripture just aik or you don't
[1:28:22] see the seven seal just alike or you
[1:28:24] don't see the Thunders just
[1:28:26] alike or you're not sure how many Souls
[1:28:29] you
[1:28:30] have well you believe anyhow and pray
[1:28:34] for the other
[1:28:35] person and just love one another you'll
[1:28:39] find there's even if your guitar player
[1:28:42] stand
[1:28:45] up love the other
[1:28:48] churches even if they do specials
[1:28:50] different than you do
[1:28:54] even if they run and you don't run and
[1:28:57] they dance and you don't dance and even
[1:29:01] if you happen to hear you're streaming
[1:29:03] their service and you hear just a little
[1:29:05] bit of tongue talking instead of getting
[1:29:07] so worked up and and passing your your
[1:29:11] clips and reels around to one another
[1:29:13] and and making fun of each other brother
[1:29:16] brandom said pray for the other person
[1:29:18] and just love one another he said you'll
[1:29:21] find their 's no greater evidence of a
[1:29:23] Christian in the
[1:29:25] world than
[1:29:27] love in 1 John chapter 4: 19 said we
[1:29:32] love
[1:29:35] him
[1:29:37] because he first loved
[1:29:41] us we wouldn't even have love in our
[1:29:44] hearts toward him had he not loved us
[1:29:47] first we can't seek God unless he's
[1:29:50] seeking us first
[1:29:52] in the message thou knowest all things
[1:29:55] I'm doing this a little quickly I I
[1:29:57] don't want to get too fast but but I
[1:29:59] want to get a lot of this out this
[1:30:00] morning so uh I don't want you to feel
[1:30:05] cheated that you're being read too a lot
[1:30:08] it's good the scriptures good these
[1:30:11] quotations are good and we need them
[1:30:15] this morning in the message thou knowest
[1:30:17] all things he said you must believe the
[1:30:20] whole thing laid in faith Jesus said he
[1:30:24] that heareth my words and believeth on
[1:30:26] him that sent me has everlasting life
[1:30:30] shall not come into condemnation but

[1:38:11] bitterness in my life can affect the
[1:38:13] other
[1:38:15] brother read on go back and read it

[1:39:06] that person in the
[1:39:08] Lord they like to add that in the Lord
[1:39:12] but I'd like to give that person a real

[1:39:51] we would let a week go by with something
[1:39:54] in our life toward one another that's
[1:39:57] right because nobody wants Christ to
[1:39:59] move out of their life if you understood
[1:40:02] that just that can cause Christ to move

[1:40:54] or your sister Christ starts moving out
[1:40:56] of your life and that poison acid of
[1:40:59] malice and jealousy and hatred it just
[1:41:01] starts boiling in you how many of you
[1:41:03] know that's just boiling a Boiling Pot
[1:41:06] of acid read on brother that will just
[1:41:08] do what it'll take the Holy Spirit right

[1:41:17] Spirit right out of the
[1:41:19] Tabernacle it'll kill the spirit of God
[1:41:22] or drive it away from here hurt your

[1:41:46] me he had the the experience with the
[1:41:49] Lord concerning the belt buckle remember
[1:41:51] and brother brandham pointed it out in a
[1:41:53] testimony service and showed him that
[1:41:55] that belt buckle appears on the on the
[1:41:58] photograph where the lies grow you've
[1:42:02] seen that picture and that's what he's
[1:42:04] referring to back in this in this take
[1:42:07] the Buckle as the brother testified a
[1:42:10] minister here the other night about
[1:42:12] having a buckle seeing it in a vision go
[1:42:15] ahead just that buckles on the whole
[1:42:19] armor of God just pull her on tighten up

[1:44:08] through find something kind and what
[1:44:12] will God
[1:44:13] do he'll bless you now uh Matthew
[1:44:17] Chapter 5 same chapter verse 47 and 48
[1:44:23] in red letter and if you salute your
[1:44:26] brethren
[1:44:30] only why what do you more than
[1:44:35] others do not even the Publican
[1:44:39] Soul if you salute your brethren
[1:44:43] only if you only go and greet those who
[1:44:47] you get along
[1:44:49] with you're do doing no different than
[1:44:51] the Sadducees and the
[1:44:55] Pharisees you're doing nothing more than
[1:44:58] the
[1:44:59] publicans you're doing nothing more than
[1:45:02] the religious you you've got to be
[1:45:04] willing to salute not only your brethren
[1:45:08] those you click with those you get along
[1:45:11] with you've also got to greet
[1:45:18] salute those that you don't right now I
[1:45:22] I I want you to look at that word salute
[1:45:24] just a moment I think I I gave it to
[1:45:27] him it's asomi and it means to treat
[1:45:32] with
[1:45:36] affection did you know you can always
[1:45:38] say God bless
[1:45:41] you the random says one of the most
[1:45:43] powerful things you can say to
[1:45:45] somebody God bless
[1:45:48] you to treat with affection to
[1:45:52] engage in hospitable
[1:45:55] recognition of
[1:45:57] another with varying degrees of
[1:46:01] intimacy to greet to
[1:46:05] welcome to pay
[1:46:08] respects to greet with
[1:46:12] kindness everybody deserves a
[1:46:16] handshake
[1:46:18] sir even if you know somebody's working
[1:46:21] against you it's in your favor it's in
[1:46:25] your good to try to greet that person
[1:46:28] anyway right and brother it can cost you
[1:46:31] something but you've got to be willing
[1:46:32] to do it anyway now I want to read the
[1:46:34] next verse of Matthew 548 he said be ye
[1:46:44] therefore what did we say perfect means
[1:46:47] in the Greek
[1:46:49] mature
[1:46:52] be ye therefore mature perfect
[1:46:55] complete even as your father which is in
[1:46:58] heaven is
[1:47:01] perfect you you can have mature love and
[1:47:04] not salute
[1:47:06] everybody that should be
[1:47:10] saluted in in first John chap 2 verse 10
[1:47:15] and 11 I don't want this to be so dry I
[1:47:18] I hope you're with me
[1:47:21] first John 2: 10 and 11 he that loveth
[1:47:24] his
[1:47:25] brother abideth in the light and there
[1:47:29] is none occasion of stumbling in him but
[1:47:33] he that hateth his brother is in
[1:47:36] darkness and walketh in darkness and
[1:47:38] knowe not whether he goeth because that
[1:47:42] Darkness hath blinded his eyes in from
[1:47:47] that time brother elas read paragraph
[1:47:50] 27 we must love we must love divinely
[1:47:56] love one another then you don't see your
[1:47:59] brother's mistakes okay oh
[1:48:05] okay you want to know whether or not
[1:48:07] you're exercising Divine
[1:48:13] love what do you think about when you
[1:48:15] think about that
[1:48:17] brother didn't I just try to do this
[1:48:19] with you couple weeks ago what's the
[1:48:22] first thing that comes to your mind his
[1:48:25] mistake his
[1:48:27] shortcoming his
[1:48:29] failure or do you think of something he
[1:48:32] gets
[1:48:34] right we must divinely love one another
[1:48:38] then you don't see your brother's
[1:48:44] mistake you do everything within your
[1:48:46] power to look over your brother's
[1:48:48] mistake and to see see him for who he
[1:48:51] really is God's child in the making
[1:48:54] that's right he hasn't allowed perhaps
[1:48:58] tribulation to work enough patience in
[1:49:00] his life but it's coming yes sir so you
[1:49:03] make sure you treat him right because
[1:49:05] God loves him so much that he's going to
[1:49:08] perfect
[1:49:09] him and so we must treat him as God
[1:49:13] would treat him worthy valuable if he
[1:49:16] does make a mistake read brother ellias
[1:49:19] what we what we should do if he does
[1:49:21] make a mistake you never you look over
[1:49:24] the top of you look right over the top
[1:49:26] of it and do what you love him anyhow
[1:49:29] love him anyhow see that's it that's it
[1:49:32] love those that love you then does not
[1:49:35] the sinner the same thing right but love
[1:49:39] those who doesn't love you that's what
[1:49:41] shows the spirit of God is in you yes
[1:49:44] yes yes cuz he loved you when you were
[1:49:47] his enemies think about it think about
[1:49:49] it think about it it and he loved you
[1:49:52] yes and that spirit's in you yes it'll
[1:49:56] make you love your enemy as you do your
[1:49:58] friend when that Holy Spirit is in you
[1:50:01] it'll make you love your enemy just the
[1:50:03] same way you would love your friend read
[1:50:05] the prophet Elisha to us
[1:50:08] please and now here is one point that I
[1:50:11] wish to stress on for a few moments that
[1:50:15] is concerning Believers hooking
[1:50:17] themselves up with unbelievers belie
[1:50:20] Believers partnering hooking themsel up
[1:50:24] with
[1:50:26] unbelievers doesn't why it doesn't work
[1:50:30] it doesn't work can everybody hear what
[1:50:32] the prophet is saying it doesn't work
[1:50:36] for believers to be hooked up with
[1:50:39] unbelievers if the first thing you think
[1:50:41] of is marriage then that's great but
[1:50:43] remember it's way more than just
[1:50:46] marriage this is any kind of partnership
[1:50:49] this is any kind of Covenant that we
[1:50:51] make with unbelievers it's a dangerous
[1:50:54] thing to do God isn't pleased with it he
[1:50:56] goes on to
[1:50:58] say God has said come out from among the
[1:51:01] unbelief that's right see you can't
[1:51:05] associate night and day together come on
[1:51:07] neither can you associate belief and
[1:51:09] unbelief together and when you find
[1:51:12] unbelief it's accompanied by hatred this
[1:51:15] is the problem this is why they have an
[1:51:18] international day of hate
[1:51:21] because unbelief is present and where
[1:51:23] unbelief is you can expect hatred to
[1:51:26] show up read on if you find faith if you
[1:51:31] find Faith it's accompanied by Love For
[1:51:36] Love creates faith I I want you to hear
[1:51:39] that love
[1:51:42] creates Faith all right brother and
[1:51:45] without and without faith why you can't
[1:51:49] have love so if you want more
[1:51:52] faith you yield yourself to more love if
[1:51:56] you need more love if you then you yield
[1:51:59] yourself to Faith because they begat one
[1:52:02] another they bring forth and manifest
[1:52:05] one another can we have a few more
[1:52:08] quotations here do you now believe
[1:52:10] paragraph
[1:52:12] 27 now there's two different kinds of
[1:52:15] love there's human love which in Greek
[1:52:18] word is a
[1:52:20] F love and then agapo love the is the
[1:52:25] high love the high love of divine love
[1:52:28] or Divine that's good now you take the F
[1:52:33] love when we have that love a mother for
[1:52:37] her baby will drive her right straight
[1:52:39] to a flaming fire to save that baby's
[1:52:41] life right it will make a man for his
[1:52:44] sweetheart lay down his life anytime see
[1:52:48] what I mean it's that's just human love
[1:52:51] right I believe somewhere in the Bible
[1:52:54] it said could a mother forget her little
[1:52:56] suckling babe right said you may but I
[1:53:00] can never forget you yes for you're
[1:53:03] engraved on the palms of my hand yes so
[1:53:06] how could God ever forsake us or
[1:53:09] anything as long as he loves us like
[1:53:12] that all right now just continue in
[1:53:14] where Pentecost failed paragraph 62 he
[1:53:18] goes back to those two kind of Love read
[1:53:20] that right out for us love God is love
[1:53:25] he that loveth is of god Divine love not
[1:53:28] affectionate love there's two different
[1:53:31] kinds of love now we know we get into
[1:53:34] this here free love and all kinds of
[1:53:37] stuff called love but that's not Divine
[1:53:40] love that's a mockery of the devil yes
[1:53:44] you know that right there's two
[1:53:46] different loves there's a love called
[1:53:49] fileo F love right and there is a love
[1:53:52] called agapa love that's
[1:53:55] right a fileo love the Greek word means
[1:53:59] the love like I would have for you as a
[1:54:02] fellow or my wife for you have for your
[1:54:06] wife a fileo love now that love if you'd
[1:54:10] catch a you'd be jealous of her listen
[1:54:13] if you catch a man insulting her you'd
[1:54:16] kill the man for it that's fileo love
[1:54:19] that's strong love
[1:54:21] love but agaba love would make you pray
[1:54:24] for his lost soul I think that's a great
[1:54:27] example I think brother brandom has
[1:54:30] really touched the best example of the
[1:54:33] contrast between the two loves that that
[1:54:36] Earthly love would make you almost be
[1:54:39] willing to kill a man because he
[1:54:41] insulted your wife but Divine love would
[1:54:44] provoke you to pray for that man's lost
[1:54:47] soul how many of you understand why we
[1:54:49] need that agapo love he said that's a
[1:54:52] difference that's where people don't
[1:54:54] understand read on see it ain't some
[1:54:57] kind of an effectual worked up mental
[1:55:01] condition it's absolutely genuine holy
[1:55:04] spirit of God that binds our hearts
[1:55:07] together in Christian fellowship and
[1:55:09] love that's love and holy spirit
[1:55:11] together again keep reading this is the
[1:55:14] message why paragraph
[1:55:17] 21 see God show showed me that in my own
[1:55:21] heart wasn't right because I was trying
[1:55:23] to condemn her and not looking at what I
[1:55:26] come from to now you'll remember this
[1:55:28] story I'm not going into all the details
[1:55:31] but remember brother brandom is coming
[1:55:33] into this place there's a lot of things
[1:55:35] going on there are Law Enforcement
[1:55:39] Officers there doing like they really
[1:55:40] ought not to be doing here is a woman
[1:55:42] sitting at a table brother brandom has
[1:55:45] something that comes on him to judge
[1:55:47] that woman remember and and said God
[1:55:50] showed me in my own heart wasn't right
[1:55:54] because I was trying to condemn her and
[1:55:56] not looking at what I come from to we
[1:56:00] should never lose sight of where we were
[1:56:04] when he found us and we ought to
[1:56:06] remember that the same God who delivered
[1:56:09] us out of the hell hole is able to
[1:56:11] deliver somebody else be willing to
[1:56:14] fight in the spirit in prayer and
[1:56:16] believe God brother brandham was really
[1:56:18] convicted here and God showed him his
[1:56:21] own heart read on brother elas so we can
[1:56:25] always remember look back to the pits
[1:56:28] where we was HED from that's right
[1:56:31] things will look a lots different see we
[1:56:35] don't want to condemn no one love
[1:56:37] everybody
[1:56:39] yes whenever you lose that real genuine
[1:56:42] love that's in your heart You' you've
[1:56:45] lost everything you've lost everything
[1:56:47] when you've lost that genuine love
[1:56:48] that's in your heart just don't never
[1:56:51] forget that that when you lose love it's
[1:56:56] all gone if you're here this morning and
[1:56:59] you recognize that your love for the
[1:57:02] Brethren or your love for the Lost has
[1:57:05] left you you don't have to leave here
[1:57:07] today
[1:57:10] Loveless you pray like we started with
[1:57:13] and let the fiery love of God come down
[1:57:15] on the Altar and lick up everything
[1:57:18] that's in us that not to be there and
[1:57:20] then let Divine love come and sit in
[1:57:23] that place this is how God has made a
[1:57:27] way for us do you believe that and I
[1:57:30] need you to get one more I know this is
[1:57:32] a lot of reading here but but I want you
[1:57:35] to get the way to have Fellowship for me
[1:57:37] paragraph
[1:57:39] 33 there's where it is tonight God has
[1:57:42] to give it then love produces a
[1:57:46] fellowship now when God said back then
[1:57:49] there the day that sin had separated
[1:57:52] that Divine love God told Adam and Eve
[1:57:55] not to eat these certain fruits and they
[1:57:58] did and sin brought separation right and
[1:58:02] sin by separation brought hatred malice
[1:58:06] Strife Envy is that right yes what
[1:58:09] happened they separated from Divine love
[1:58:12] Adam and Eve were separated from Divine
[1:58:16] love yes sir Now read on and when you
[1:58:19] separate from Divine love then you can't
[1:58:22] overlook your brother's mistakes no more
[1:58:25] are we in that place
[1:58:27] Church where we cannot Overlook our
[1:58:30] brother's
[1:58:31] failures or our sister's shortcomings
[1:58:34] anymore if we are then we have separated
[1:58:38] ourself from Divine love read on brother
[1:58:42] you got to ball him out for it yeah
[1:58:45] that's right mhm you can't Overlook
[1:58:48] sister mistakes no more because you've
[1:58:51] got away from that Divine part that love
[1:58:54] part but if you really love the Lord
[1:58:57] Jesus yes if sister or brother does
[1:59:00] something to you oh well that's all
[1:59:03] right they didn't mean to do it I know
[1:59:07] what you
[1:59:08] meant yes you did mean to do that come
[1:59:12] on that's the
[1:59:14] opposite here is if a brother or sister
[1:59:16] does something wrong to you in your
[1:59:18] heart you say why they didn't they
[1:59:20] didn't set out to do that that wasn't in
[1:59:23] their heart come on that's not what they
[1:59:26] meant to
[1:59:28] do that's the kind of love that Christ
[1:59:31] had yes it is Father forgive them they
[1:59:34] don't know what they're doing how many
[1:59:35] of you want that kind of love in your
[1:59:37] heart this morning are you still with me
[1:59:40] let's go to Ephesians chapter
[1:59:43] 4 beginning in verse 11 and he gave some
[1:59:48] apostles
[1:59:49] and some prophets and some
[1:59:53] evangelists and some
[1:59:56] pastors and teachers we call that a
[1:59:59] five-fold
[2:00:00] Ministry it's
[2:00:02] important you see in in this hour of uh
[2:00:07] of popularity for press play and
[2:00:11] Obey we can't ignore this part of the
[2:00:14] word the perfecting of the Saints
[2:00:17] doesn't come just by press play and Obey
[2:00:22] it comes by by a Ministry of Apostles
[2:00:26] prophets pastors teachers and
[2:00:30] evangelists somebody said well that's
[2:00:32] talking about brother Brandon I'm not
[2:00:34] even putting brother brandom in the
[2:00:35] five-fold
[2:00:37] ministry you can if you want
[2:00:40] to he wasn't a five-fold
[2:00:43] prophet you please understand that's not
[2:00:46] where he fits and that's that's why it
[2:00:49] says with an S
[2:00:51] Apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[2:00:56] evangelists and why is that five-fold
[2:00:59] Ministry sometimes referred to as the
[2:01:01] Ascension gifts because the Bible said
[2:01:04] when he ascended he that had descended
[2:01:07] he now ascends and what does he do he
[2:01:10] gives gifts unto men and that's part of
[2:01:15] this five-fold ministry and what is
[2:01:17] their purpose for the
[2:01:19] maturing say it with me for the maturing
[2:01:22] for the perfecting of the Saints for the
[2:01:26] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[2:01:29] the body of Christ now this whole
[2:01:32] concept of everybody listing to the same
[2:01:36] tape at the same time all over the world
[2:01:39] in the comfort of their home when
[2:01:41] there's a $3 million Church sitting
[2:01:44] there there's something wrong with that
[2:01:47] there's something wrong with that
[2:01:48] concept concept because Perfection
[2:01:51] doesn't come through
[2:01:52] isolation perfecting comes when we get
[2:01:56] together forsake not the assembling of
[2:01:58] yourselves together we need to be
[2:02:02] together so that we can knock the rough
[2:02:05] edges off so there's something wrong
[2:02:08] with a headquarters that now says you
[2:02:11] stay
[2:02:12] home you listen to the same tape we'll
[2:02:16] get up in the middle of the night on the
[2:02:18] other side of the world so that we can
[2:02:20] hear the tape at the same time and maybe
[2:02:23] one day we'll gather again yesterday
[2:02:28] they send out an email that says we're
[2:02:30] just waiting on the
[2:02:32] messenger to come and say there he is I
[2:02:37] believe the messenger has already said
[2:02:40] there he is pointing us to Christ so in
[2:02:45] my understanding here we don't stand a
[2:02:48] chance at being perfected by the
[2:02:51] fivefold ministry if we isolate
[2:02:53] ourselves in our homes it's a spirit
[2:02:57] it's the same spirit that that brought
[2:02:59] covid to
[2:03:01] us that tried to shut the churches down
[2:03:06] to keep us
[2:03:07] apart sir people Marvel they Marvel
[2:03:11] people are absolutely shocked when they
[2:03:14] find out that we just kept right
[2:03:17] on because we understood it's no longer
[2:03:20] an issue of Health it's an issue of
[2:03:24] control it's not the government's
[2:03:26] control that we're concerned about it's
[2:03:29] that Antichrist
[2:03:30] spirit and if there is a spirit that can
[2:03:34] keep us out from under the influence of
[2:03:36] a real genuine fivefold Ministry then
[2:03:40] the church cannot be perfected so God
[2:03:44] has given us Apostles prophets pastors
[2:03:47] teachers and evangelists for what what
[2:03:49] reason for
[2:03:51] the perfecting of the Saints for the
[2:03:55] work listen folks
[2:03:59] nitty-gritty you need
[2:04:02] nitty-gritty we need a pastor we need
[2:04:05] Apostles we need evangelist we need that
[2:04:08] five-fold Ministry who'll bring it right
[2:04:10] up to
[2:04:12] 2024 see it's not I Love Lucy that we
[2:04:15] got to stay away from in this hour it's
[2:04:19] much worse than
[2:04:20] that if your only concept of Filth on
[2:04:24] television is
[2:04:25] Lucy you're living in another
[2:04:29] [Music]
[2:04:31] generation you see the Rapture is
[2:04:34] overdue but because it's overdue doesn't
[2:04:37] mean we get slack we cannot we need the
[2:04:41] perfecting of the Saints for the work of
[2:04:42] the ministry for the
[2:04:45] edifying the building up of what
[2:04:50] the body of Christ till how long how
[2:04:52] long will there be a five-fold
[2:04:56] Ministry till we all somebody say all
[2:05:00] what does all
[2:05:02] mean you think all means all till we all
[2:05:06] come the bride till we all come in the
[2:05:11] unity of the faith and of the knowledge
[2:05:16] of the son of God
[2:05:21] unto and that's not a bunch of perfect
[2:05:24] men coming together to
[2:05:27] worship unto a perfect man that's Jesus
[2:05:30] Christ amen he is the stature of the
[2:05:34] perfect man we're we're raising up to
[2:05:38] that unto a perfect man unto the measure
[2:05:41] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[2:05:44] I want to read that verse again till we
[2:05:46] all come in the unity of the faith and
[2:05:48] of the knowledge of the Son of God unto
[2:05:51] a perfect man unto the measure of the
[2:05:54] stature of the fullness of Christ until
[2:05:57] we are
[2:06:00] matured Perfection is not without
[2:06:04] mistake that's not even what it means
[2:06:07] here it's not meaning without mistake
[2:06:10] you may make mistakes it means maturity
[2:06:15] we're coming to maturity the things that
[2:06:19] hurt our
[2:06:21] feelings the things that hurt our
[2:06:23] feelings in the past don't hurt our
[2:06:25] feelings
[2:06:27] anymore because we're becoming
[2:06:30] unoffendable we realize God will have to
[2:06:33] take care of that God will have to deal
[2:06:36] with that well I didn't get my thank
[2:06:41] you I didn't get
[2:06:45] recognized I didn't get a candy bar
[2:06:49] see we're coming to
[2:06:52] maturity and it's not an easy
[2:06:55] climb it's only by his grace that we can
[2:06:59] climb as long as you pet people's
[2:07:01] feelings hello come on as long as you
[2:07:04] massage people's
[2:07:06] feelings and call that
[2:07:13] love you'll remain
[2:07:16] stagnant come on brother Venom's
[2:07:19] preaching away he said what is that that
[2:07:21] Spirit over here is calling out to that
[2:07:23] Spirit over there the devil want
[2:07:27] sympathy the devil wants somebody to
[2:07:30] feel sorry for
[2:07:31] him you get under that Spirit
[2:07:37] folks well I'm just overworked well I'm
[2:07:40] just over stressed well I'm just really
[2:07:42] going through a hard time I'm really in
[2:07:45] a battle I want you to point your finger
[2:07:47] to somebody in in this
[2:07:50] house that's not
[2:07:53] overworked I want you to find here for
[2:07:56] me somebody that's not
[2:07:59] stressed would you show me somebody that
[2:08:01] hadn't fought the devil all week to get
[2:08:04] back to church today then you are not
[2:08:07] the only one and it is not sympathy you
[2:08:10] need it's
[2:08:12] Deliverance you need to be free from
[2:08:15] that Spirit that'll tell you that
[2:08:17] everybody is against you and everybody
[2:08:20] hates you and you ought to just eat
[2:08:23] worms no you ought to run to
[2:08:27] God and become
[2:08:30] undefendable I don't go to church to be
[2:08:32] recognized I go to church to serve God
[2:08:36] come
[2:08:37] on
[2:08:40] woo let me get back to the
[2:08:42] notes a mature man a perfect man let's
[2:08:45] look at what that word perfect there
[2:08:47] means here's what it means so if you see
[2:08:51] anything in this that indicates without
[2:08:56] mistake or without
[2:08:59] Humanity then I'll adjust what I'm
[2:09:03] saying but it doesn't mean that at all
[2:09:06] it means a full
[2:09:08] age it means brought to its end finished
[2:09:13] wanting nothing necessary to
[2:09:15] completeness perfect consummate human
[2:09:19] integrity and virtue of men full
[2:09:22] grown adult a full age
[2:09:26] mature now the kind of love that we've
[2:09:29] got to press into is the mature kind the
[2:09:32] kind that is not fickle the kind that is
[2:09:35] not Prejudice the kind that doesn't
[2:09:38] impede us it propels us it advances us
[2:09:43] are you with me this morning in the
[2:09:45] message is this the end of the uh uh is
[2:09:47] this the sign of the end sir is what
[2:09:51] they're calling it now in 62 he said you
[2:09:55] remember the P pyramid
[2:09:57] message he said it's the Capstone yes
[2:10:01] what did it do the Holy Spirit kept off
[2:10:06] the individual and seal it when we added
[2:10:10] to our
[2:10:13] faith
[2:10:15] righteousness godliness and faith and so
[2:10:18] forth brother Bam's not pulling up the
[2:10:20] virtues here but he's giving us some
[2:10:23] examples and he said and kept adding to
[2:10:27] it till we got seven
[2:10:30] things when you read the stature of a
[2:10:33] perfect man or you listen to brother Ram
[2:10:35] or you go to Peter and read it for
[2:10:37] yourself it's not like you stand in line
[2:10:40] to get a a a portion of all of these
[2:10:43] things the holy spirit said to us years
[2:10:46] ago it's a birth
[2:10:49] you're not standing in line with a cup
[2:10:51] hoping the Lord will give you more
[2:10:53] godliness you're going to have to be
[2:10:56] birthed from virtue to Virtue it's a
[2:10:59] climbing
[2:11:01] Expedition we're moving up into the
[2:11:04] stature of the fullness of Christ the
[2:11:07] stature of the perfect man and in order
[2:11:09] to do that it's a squeeze yes now
[2:11:13] anybody in this room that's ever given
[2:11:16] birth or ever watch to birth will tell
[2:11:19] you there is no Deliverance there is no
[2:11:23] birth without a
[2:11:26] squeeze it's a
[2:11:28] contraction and when this little bride
[2:11:31] is contracted is squeezed from one of
[2:11:34] these virtues to the next to the next to
[2:11:37] the next to the next it's still not
[2:11:41] enough because we come up to the top and
[2:11:45] we're still missing something right we
[2:11:48] have godliness and then brotherly
[2:11:50] kindness and we are still missing
[2:11:53] something and so brother brandham wrote
[2:11:56] on the on the diagram Holy
[2:11:59] Spirit we've got to have the Holy Spirit
[2:12:02] to come and cap us to get ready to
[2:12:05] receive the
[2:12:07] headstone yes the holy spirit is in the
[2:12:10] Gap the holy spirit is wrote at the top
[2:12:15] and then comes the headstone or the
[2:12:17] Capstone and the Capstone is Love The
[2:12:20] Headstone is perfect love the top of of
[2:12:24] the pyramid it's kept with Divine
[2:12:29] love you can't demonstrate the fullness
[2:12:33] of mature love divine love perfect love
[2:12:36] until you have moved from one virtue up
[2:12:39] to the next virtue to the next virtue to
[2:12:41] the next
[2:12:43] virtue if these virtues I won't stay on
[2:12:46] this long is it'll get quieter
[2:12:50] quiet if these virtues are the
[2:12:54] Thunders like so many people preach they
[2:12:57] were supposed to produce more in
[2:13:00] us than they have produced thus far sir
[2:13:05] sir somebody's missing something
[2:13:09] somewhere because we've had the perfect
[2:13:11] word and the bride is still
[2:13:16] immature we're going to need more of the
[2:13:19] Holy Ghost we're going to need more of
[2:13:21] the grace of God if brother Brandon put
[2:13:24] Holy Ghost right up there at the
[2:13:26] top then that means we haven't moved
[2:13:29] past the Holy Ghost now what we have
[2:13:32] moved past is trying to speak in
[2:13:35] tongues that's what he said it's a
[2:13:37] direct quote we're no longer trying to
[2:13:41] speak in tonu we're not trying to
[2:13:44] exercise the gifts we have now come to a
[2:13:47] place where God can exercise whatever he
[2:13:50] wants to exercise in us for the
[2:13:52] edification of the body of Christ so
[2:13:55] it's no longer a a striving or a human
[2:13:58] effort to try to make some Pentecostal
[2:14:02] sensation it's more than that we're now
[2:14:06] Reaching Forward for the final baptism
[2:14:09] of the Holy Ghost which is one that
[2:14:12] doesn't come with emotion or feeling it
[2:14:16] comes with perfection in
[2:14:20] completion and it's not coming that seal
[2:14:23] of the Holy Ghost is not coming until
[2:14:26] the conductor opens up and inspects the
[2:14:32] car you hear what he said there's a
[2:14:36] manifest there's an invoice on the train
[2:14:39] car and everything that's on there add
[2:14:43] to your faith virtue come on it's all
[2:14:46] written there on the on on the
[2:14:48] Manifest it's all written there on the
[2:14:51] invoice and if that conductor comes
[2:14:54] along and sees something missing he will
[2:14:56] not seal the
[2:14:58] cart once he seals that car and writes
[2:15:02] the destination on the seal it can't be
[2:15:05] open
[2:15:06] anymore until it reaches its
[2:15:09] destination so there is something yet
[2:15:12] the bride is reaching
[2:15:14] for we sing we're sealed We Believe
[2:15:17] believe that we're sealed we testify
[2:15:20] that we're sealed but we cannot have the
[2:15:23] fullness of the seal if something's
[2:15:25] missing on the
[2:15:28] Manifest so we're asking the Lord
[2:15:31] whatever it
[2:15:33] takes I know it sounds like a foolish
[2:15:36] prayer but it's the only prayer I can
[2:15:39] think of that's going to get us where we
[2:15:40] need to be whatever it takes Lord to
[2:15:44] move me from Faith to
[2:15:46] Virtue yes whatever it takes Lord to
[2:15:50] move me up into that
[2:15:53] kindness to move me through that
[2:15:55] godliness where brother brandom said
[2:15:57] it's just like God so that the Holy
[2:16:00] Ghost can come sit on top of this little
[2:16:02] bride and call the
[2:16:05] Capstone and here it comes Hallelujah
[2:16:08] here it comes Zechariah prophesied here

[2:16:26] this little bride out of here it's going
[2:16:28] to take bride Grace it's going to take

[2:21:39] these seven things and the seventh one
[2:21:41] was love which is God that's how he
[2:21:43] makes the individual and caps him and
[2:21:46] seals him come with the holy spirit

[2:21:54] four paragraph 101 I said oh

[2:22:01] for trying to set the church in order
[2:22:04] telling you brother sister there's only
[2:22:06] one thing that can enter
[2:22:10] that yes that's perfect
[2:22:16] love
[2:22:20] that's the kind of church
[2:22:21] order that we need to be crying out
[2:22:25] for
[2:22:28] yes not three songs and turn off the
[2:22:31] lights while people are
[2:22:34] worshiping come on he said I've come
[2:22:37] here to set the church in order telling
[2:22:39] you brother sister there's only one
[2:22:40] thing that can enter that that's perfect
[2:22:46] love brother Billy Paul is leaving north
[2:22:52] Alabama brother Arnon West has
[2:22:55] died the father to brother Benny
[2:22:59] West he has come for the

[2:23:05] sister West granny West's
[2:23:08] home the family is gathered there the
[2:23:12] sons and the daughter are gathered there
[2:23:15] on the porch brother Billy Paul is
[2:23:17] leaving the home after the funeral in
[2:23:19] fellowship and he's looking up at them
[2:23:21] and he says
[2:23:24] oh I wish that I could tell
[2:23:28] you oh I wish that I could tell
[2:23:33] you but I promised my
[2:23:35] dad that I would never speak it to a
[2:23:41] soul he said but I'll tell you what it
[2:23:44] had to do
[2:23:46] with it had to do with perfect
[2:23:52] love that's all he
[2:23:55] said here is brother brandham telling us
[2:23:58] the only thing that can enter
[2:24:01] that is perfect love mature love yes
[2:24:05] mature love if you want to
[2:24:07] read how mature love
[2:24:11] manifest you start reading in 1
[2:24:13] Corinthians chapter
[2:24:16] 13 that's right the kind of love that's
[2:24:19] described there is more than husband
[2:24:21] wife love right I know the church has
[2:24:25] tried to teach that uh as as fileo
[2:24:29] love but I want you to know the love
[2:24:31] that is described there is beyond human
[2:24:34] capacity that's the truth it's perfect
[2:24:37] love it's mature love he said not
[2:24:39] because you're loyal to the brandom
[2:24:41] Tabernacle or the Methodist Church or
[2:24:44] the Baptist Church notice how he puts
[2:24:46] all the churches in in the same category
[2:24:48] yeah he said them's all right you should
[2:24:50] be but oh friends not because you spoke
[2:24:53] with tongues amen danced in the spirit
[2:24:56] amen because you've cast out Devils or
[2:24:59] move mountains with faith amen he said
[2:25:02] that's all right for that's all right
[2:25:05] but still unless that real perfect love
[2:25:10] that mature love is in there
[2:25:15] amen that's the the only thing that can
[2:25:18] stay
[2:25:20] there he said that was where perfect
[2:25:22] love was and that's the only thing
[2:25:25] that'll let you in there that's the only
[2:25:28] thing that can stay there it's the only
[2:25:31] thing that was there oh my listen what
[2:25:35] he
[2:25:36] said this is adoption number four he
[2:25:40] said it's an adoption
[2:25:43] adoption
[2:25:45] yes what comes what happens what takes
[2:25:48] place when we start manifesting mature
[2:25:51] Love full adoption
[2:25:55] right potentially we're
[2:25:58] there but we have some climbing yet to
[2:26:01] do yes sir he said God before the
[2:26:04] foundation of the world do I have a
[2:26:05] little more time yes sir he said now
[2:26:07] let's hurry up let's get this one
[2:26:10] chapter through anyhow if possible in
[2:26:12] the next 10 minutes to whom we also have
[2:26:14] obtained an inheritance we inherit what
[2:26:17] eternal life being predestinated how
[2:26:19] does everybody understand that did you
[2:26:21] call on God and he's trying to get
[2:26:23] through the verses here God called on
[2:26:25] you some people say oh I just sought God
[2:26:27] and sought God you did not no man ever
[2:26:30] sought God it's God seeking man Jesus
[2:26:33] said no man can come to me except my
[2:26:35] father draws him first see it's the
[2:26:37] nature of man to do what run from
[2:26:41] God and you say
[2:26:43] now paragraph 103 he said
[2:26:47] that's what bothers me though to preach
[2:26:50] to you
[2:26:52] people don't remain on in the same
[2:26:55] condition you've been going
[2:26:59] in change
[2:27:03] now hear me as I say it thus sayith the
[2:27:08] Lord I've never called myself this I'm
[2:27:12] not but you call me your Prophet or a
[2:27:18] Prophet the world believes that the
[2:27:20] world millions and millions and millions
[2:27:22] of people I spoke directly and
[2:27:24] indirectly to 10 or 12 million people or
[2:27:27] more directly
[2:27:29] speaking I've seen tens of thousands of
[2:27:32] visions and signs and wonders and not
[2:27:34] one of them ever failed and that's right
[2:27:36] he's foretold me things that's never
[2:27:38] failed to happen just exactly I'll bring
[2:27:40] any man to try for that that's right I
[2:27:43] don't claim to be a prophet but you
[2:27:45] listen to me
[2:27:51] thus saith the Lord it'll take perfect
[2:27:55] love to put you in that place for that's
[2:28:00] all there was there right when he went
[2:28:05] beyond the curtain of
[2:28:07] time there was no physical
[2:28:10] sensation in the love that was
[2:28:13] displayed he said those sisters could
[2:28:16] embrace R me and there was no physical
[2:28:19] sensation it wasn't love like we have
[2:28:22] loved in the earth it was a Divine love
[2:28:26] it was a Godly love Which is higher and
[2:28:30] Superior to all other forms of love are
[2:28:32] you leaving me are you still here he
[2:28:35] said no matter what money how much
[2:28:37] religious demonstration how many Good
[2:28:39] Deeds you done or whatever you done that
[2:28:42] won't count nothing on that
[2:28:44] day it'll take what perfect love so
[2:28:48] whatever you do somebody hear me
[2:28:51] whatever you do you lay aside everything
[2:28:57] else until you are just so filled with
[2:29:01] the love of
[2:29:03] God till you can love
[2:29:07] those who hate you who
[2:29:11] hate
[2:29:15] you he said I I just said this morning I
[2:29:18] was my whole makeup is
[2:29:21] Grace a lot of people say now you
[2:29:24] scratch my back I'll scratch yours yeah
[2:29:26] you do something for me I'll do
[2:29:28] something for you he said that's not
[2:29:33] Grace Grace is your if your back is
[2:29:35] itching I'll scratch it anyhow whether
[2:29:37] you scratch mine or not slap me on the
[2:29:40] face and say my back needs itching or
[2:29:42] needs scratch it I'll scratch it see
[2:29:45] that's it do something I don't believe
[2:29:47] in
[2:29:48] works I believe that works
[2:29:53] is
[2:29:54] love works is the manifestation that
[2:29:58] Grace has taken place I don't live true
[2:30:00] to my wife because I believe she
[2:30:02] divorced me if I didn't I live true to
[2:30:07] her because I love
[2:30:10] her now I want you to look at first John
[2:30:13] with me just a moment before we
[2:30:15] close first first John chap 4 where we
[2:30:19] have been recently verse 17 and 18 we're
[2:30:22] revisiting this in
[2:30:31] closing here in is our
[2:30:34] love made
[2:30:36] perfect made
[2:30:39] mature that we may have boldness in the
[2:30:43] day of judgment because as he is
[2:30:47] so are we in this
[2:30:49] world there is no fear in
[2:30:55] love
[2:30:59] amen but perfect
[2:31:01] love mature love casteth out fear amen
[2:31:07] because fear hath torment he that
[2:31:10] feareth is not made perfect in love to
[2:31:16] short places to read in the rejected
[2:31:20] King he said and I Heard a Voice then
[2:31:22] that spoke to me that was in the room
[2:31:24] said this is what you preached was the
[2:31:27] Holy
[2:31:28] Ghost he's beyond the curtain of time
[2:31:34] now he saw those people are all these
[2:31:37] Broms remember we can't read it all this
[2:31:41] morning these are those who believed
[2:31:44] your
[2:31:45] message there was love those sisters
[2:31:49] came it's interesting how he describes
[2:31:52] the
[2:31:54] men they looked a little
[2:31:57] odd he talks about their
[2:31:59] hair being a little out of the
[2:32:03] ordinary he talks about the beauty of
[2:32:05] the
[2:32:06] sisters they're in the prime of their
[2:32:09] life their hair is not pinned up it's
[2:32:13] hanging down their backs they're all in
[2:32:16] the Prime of their
[2:32:18] life he said the voice spoke and said
[2:32:21] this is what you preached was the Holy
[2:32:24] Ghost this is perfect love and nothing
[2:32:28] can enter here without
[2:32:32] it this is where he got that
[2:32:35] understanding and Revelation he said I
[2:32:37] am more determined than ever in my life
[2:32:42] that it takes perfect love to enter
[2:32:45] there
[2:32:47] I want you to read the rest the jeal
[2:32:51] there was
[2:32:59] no oh I wished I had a husband like she
[2:33:02] does you got the one you
[2:33:10] chose oh I wish my wife was more like
[2:33:13] his
[2:33:15] wife
[2:33:19] you don't have a uh this is not
[2:33:23] Walmart they don't have a return
[2:33:28] counter some of these places is so good
[2:33:31] you don't even have to have your receipt
[2:33:33] right they'll just exchange for you
[2:33:36] can't take your wife up there to
[2:33:40] The Exchange counter and say I'd like to
[2:33:43] trade her in on a newer model you chose
[2:33:45] her
[2:33:48] they do it they do it they do it even
[2:33:51] around this message they do it even
[2:33:53] after marriage and divorce has been
[2:33:55] preached they still do it they still
[2:33:57] divorce and remarry right around this
[2:34:00] message
[2:34:02] yes they ignore what he said God have
[2:34:07] mercy on you if you ever do it
[2:34:13] again and the pastors stand right up and
[2:34:15] Mar
[2:34:18] Rhythm nobody quits going to the camp
[2:34:21] meetings nobody quits supporting the
[2:34:24] preachers nobody come on they're just I
[2:34:27] mean they're still in the top
[2:34:29] 10 they forgotten what he said don't you
[2:34:33] think that the Lord knew the longer and
[2:34:36] longer and longer the Rapture
[2:34:39] carried the looser and looser and looser
[2:34:42] it would get but not that real bride
[2:34:46] on she recognizes what's happening
[2:34:49] around her and she wants to draw up as
[2:34:51] close to him as she possibly can she
[2:34:55] doesn't want to go back to the paganism
[2:34:58] she wants to run to the
[2:35:02] word she doesn't want to take a chance
[2:35:05] and gamble with her
[2:35:08] soul she runs to
[2:35:11] Christ she runs to
[2:35:14] him there was no
[2:35:17] jealousy no
[2:35:20] comparison there was no tiredness there
[2:35:23] was no
[2:35:25] death sickness could never end there
[2:35:29] could never enter in there
[2:35:33] morality never make you feel old
[2:35:36] mortality excuse me could never make you
[2:35:38] feel old they could not
[2:35:42] cry I love
[2:35:44] this imagine and losing your leaky
[2:35:49] head no more weeping and
[2:35:52] mourning just
[2:35:54] one
[2:35:56] Joy adoption number four same message
[2:35:59] where we just were I'm reading
[2:36:03] again thus sayth the Lord it'll take
[2:36:06] perfect love to put you in that place
[2:36:09] for that's all there was there no matter
[2:36:11] what money how many religious
[2:36:12] demonstrations how many Good Deeds
[2:36:14] musicians are coming
[2:36:17] no matter how many Deeds Good Deeds
[2:36:19] you've done or whatever You' done that
[2:36:21] won't count nothing on that
[2:36:23] day it'll
[2:36:26] take so whatever you do you lay aside
[2:36:31] everything else until you're just so
[2:36:32] filled with the love of God till you can
[2:36:35] love
[2:36:39] those who hate
[2:36:42] you brother brandom said I'm going to
[2:36:44] let you in on a little secret
[2:36:50] he said that's how I control wild
[2:36:55] animals that's
[2:36:57] right because when when perfect love is
[2:37:02] projected Sovereign divine
[2:37:05] grace takes
[2:37:07] over he talked to us about the man I'll
[2:37:10] I'll share this with you refresh your
[2:37:13] memory another

[2:37:32] different one place he told it one one
[2:37:35] town in one situation another place he
[2:37:37] told it other listen listen folks of all
[2:37:40] the gifts that brother brandham had in
[2:37:42] his ministry he did not have the gift of
[2:37:45] perfect Rec
[2:37:47] call let's just settle that this
[2:37:50] morning and until we had the computer
[2:37:53] and we had all the had it all in our the
[2:37:55] table and had it all in our hand we
[2:37:57] didn't even know for years people didn't
[2:38:00] even know that these things were told
[2:38:03] differently when I first came to the
[2:38:04] message they stood the old General stood
[2:38:07] up the ones that were with brother
[2:38:08] brandham stood up and they said I heard
[2:38:10] him tell a story a hundred times and he
[2:38:12] never told it different uh the the H
[2:38:14] hundredth time and we now know that
[2:38:16] wasn't the
[2:38:19] truth that wasn't the truth he was a
[2:38:22] human being he was a man he forgot
[2:38:25] things that has nothing to do with the
[2:38:28] ministry it has Absol in fact to me it's
[2:38:31] the most encouraging thing uh what they
[2:38:34] what they use to Discount and to throw
[2:38:37] the prophet away and to throw the
[2:38:38] message away is one of the reasons I
[2:38:40] want to cling to it even more because it
[2:38:43] proves to me that God used
[2:38:46] broken men human come on imperfect
[2:38:50] vessels and that lets me know I have a
[2:38:53] chance to be used in some capacity for
[2:38:56] God and you have a chance to be
[2:39:05] used so whether it was the man from
[2:39:08] Windsor or whether he was the man from
[2:39:11] tinbu
[2:39:13] two I don't care
[2:39:16] all I know is brother brandham had an
[2:39:18] opportunity to speak his immediate
[2:39:21] death and instead he put him at his
[2:39:24] feet and he lays over the man's shoes
[2:39:27] and brother brandham said you don't cast
[2:39:29] out
[2:39:30] Devils with a bad
[2:39:33] Spirit he said you do it with with love
[2:39:35] you do it with Divine love and he said
[2:39:38] it was because of that love that that
[2:39:40] man was laid right across my he talks
[2:39:42] about the
[2:39:44] bull he talks about the
[2:39:48] Hornets he talks about the mother
[2:39:51] possum he said I'm let you in on a
[2:39:53] little cig that's how I've controlled
[2:39:55] those wild
[2:39:56] animals Divine
[2:40:00] love a Christian Mystic of a of another
[2:40:08] generation suar
[2:40:12] sing had a rock that he used to go out
[2:40:14] to pray on
[2:40:17] and leopards would
[2:40:20] come lay down at his
[2:40:22] feet and he would stroke the leopard
[2:40:25] while he talked to God he must have
[2:40:28] learned
[2:40:30] something he must have learned something
[2:40:34] brother Braham said it was divine love
[2:40:36] it was the projection of divine love
[2:40:39] that caused those animals to to to
[2:40:41] change their nature for a moment and the
[2:40:45] enemy a man this wild Raging Bull these
[2:40:48] Hornets that could have stung him and
[2:40:50] took his life instead he just blesses
[2:40:52] them right back into
[2:40:55] their right back into their
[2:40:58] nest now listen if Divine love can do
[2:41:00] that what could it do in a little church
[2:41:02] like
[2:41:04] this it'd make your enemies be at peace
[2:41:07] with
[2:41:08] you it make you pray with the most
[2:41:10] sincerity you've ever prayed for one
[2:41:12] another you've never prayed for anybody
[2:41:15] with that much sincerity as you would if
[2:41:18] God should fill us
[2:41:20] today with that Divine love you will be
[2:41:26] tested would you like for me to tell you
[2:41:28] the times I've been tested since I've
[2:41:30] been preaching this well that'd be too
[2:41:33] transparent wouldn't it I'll only tell
[2:41:35] you
[2:41:37] one I got an
[2:41:40] inbox from a
[2:41:43] minister doesn't preach this
[2:41:47] message but I've known him a long
[2:41:51] time and he said I would love to record
[2:41:54] your
[2:41:56] song I want to ask your
[2:42:04] permission and in my mind I saw the
[2:42:07] things he had
[2:42:11] stolen the things that he had
[2:42:14] taken
[2:42:16] and the folks he had
[2:42:19] destroyed and I said 'lord I'm not there
[2:42:22] yet I was
[2:42:24] tested and I failed the
[2:42:26] test the first thing I thought of was
[2:42:29] not any good that he might have done the
[2:42:33] first thing I thought of was his rotten
[2:42:37] Humanity the people that he had
[2:42:39] defrauded even went to prison for
[2:42:44] it now I prayed until I I prayed until I
[2:42:50] ate I started out angry with myself and
[2:42:54] that don't change anything I prayed
[2:42:57] through
[2:42:58] that until my heart was melted for
[2:43:03] him and his lack of
[2:43:06] understanding and when I prayed to that
[2:43:08] point that I could love him like Christ
[2:43:12] loved him took me two days
[2:43:16] I wished I could have tell you it took
[2:43:18] me 20
[2:43:19] minutes it took me two days and I wrote
[2:43:22] him back and I said of course you don't
[2:43:24] owe me anything you record it and do
[2:43:27] anything you want to with it God gave it
[2:43:29] to me it doesn't belong it it doesn't
[2:43:31] belong to me it it's his just go right
[2:43:33] ahead and all the
[2:43:36] joy I'm being honest the joy that
[2:43:39] flooded my
[2:43:41] heart oh thought what does it
[2:43:44] matter it doesn't even
[2:43:47] matter I I I'm too near home right my

[2:44:13] vow I I I had such Joy come into my
[2:44:16] heart and I thought Lord the next time I
[2:44:19] meet I meet a test like that please
[2:44:22] don't don't allow it to take me two days
[2:44:26] remind me remind me of the benefit of
[2:44:29] divine love remind me of the benefit of
[2:44:32] letting my love mature in You Remind Me
[2:44:35] Lord provoke me whatever I need shake me
[2:44:38] remind me jerk me around if that's what
[2:44:41] I need so that I can come to love
[2:44:46] because without
[2:44:48] it seems to me like you can have all the
[2:44:51] revelation of the
[2:44:55] word and not have that
[2:44:59] love and miss it let's stand so God will
[2:45:05] help
