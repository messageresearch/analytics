TRANSCRIPT
========================================
that's right and you and I better not only know we're fixing things up with God we better know we're Rapture Ready remember we're not going to be judged in Rapture by what's only abounding in our lives but we're going to be judged by what's put there the seed that is within us and I want you to know everything we need to make the Rapture is in us right now because we've received the word of God that's what it takes to get out of here but that seed is watered and at different times it blooms and produces fruit in our life and we want to live a fruitful life for him but we want to know that we are ready and the people started gathering in the 60s from the North and the South and the East and the West they gathered to Rally around a word that they discerned was sent to help prepare them for the Rapture I believe that the message and the revelation of Jesus Christ that he has sent to us is not for everyone I don't believe it was sent for the church at large I believe it was sent to an elected number I don't know the number I know there's some in the East and the and the and the west and the North and the South I know some have light skin in some have dark skin and some have un between in between skin some from one continent and some from another continent it's not about one church it's about those who have received a real unveiling of Jesus Christ it's the revealing of the word it's the word revealed that's what our wedding garment is what I think is the biggest deal is that we hold St ready under the influence of this revealed word until every fiber is filled with the Holy Ghost and Jesus said when he the Holy Ghost has come he will lead you guide you and direct you into all truth
