Description:
“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.” Genesis 1:1-5

god the holy spirit the holy ghost of god and adam became a living soul i was reminded that abram received the ruach of god the breath of god and and avram became avraham because of the addition of the breath of god to his life you are no longer who you were before your spirit was regenerated by the living spirit of christ the living spirit of god we are no longer just breathing oxygen from planet earth but we are drawing from the very zoe the very life of a living god it's your breath it's your breath so no wonder the psalmist said let everything that hath breath everything that god has created everything that god has built let everything that hath breath praise you the lord you know rocks have never breathed but jesus said i i can pray my father and he is able to raise up these stones like children of abraham that they would praise the lord if you should hold your peace they've never a rock on the ground has never had the breath of god in it but i love this i love the fact that yeshua jesus the creator he knew that all he had to do was speak and those rocks would have raised up with the breath of god and they would have also had to begin to give god praise so here we stand today determined that no rock is going to have to be raised up in my place but i'm going to praise the lord i'm going to use this breath use this life that god has given me to glorify his name amen [Music] let's just sing that course again [Music] it's your breath in our lungs so we pour out our praise we pour out our praise it's your breath in our lungs so we pour out our praise to all it's your breath in our lungs so we pour out our praise oh we pour out our praise it's your breath [Music] in our lungs so we pour out our praise to you [Music] and all the earth will shine your

[Music] in our lungs so we pour out our praise to all it's your breath in our lungs so we pour out our praise we pour out our praise into your breath in our lungs so we pour out our praise to you only it's your breath in our lungs so we pour out our praise pour out our praise it's your breath in our lungs so we pour out our praise to you [Music] you are worthy of all praise you are worthy of our worship lord oh hallelujah hallelujah oh we worship you i woke up this morning with this song really on my heart so we're gonna sing it this morning [Music] so many times i've questioned certain circumstances and things i could not understand oh and many times in trials the weakness blurs my vision that's when my frustration gets so out of hand [Music] but it's then i am reminded that i've never been forsaken and i've never had to stand one test alone that's when i look at all the victories and the spear in her eyes is up in me and it's through the fire my wingnesses are made [Applause] he never promised that the cross would not get heavy or the hill would not be hard to climb no and he never offered our victories without fighting but he said he would [Music] and the adversary says given oh but just hold on my lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again cause i know within myself that i would surely perish oh but if i trust the mighty hand of god he'll shield those flames again he never promised that the cross would not get heavy for the hill would not be hard to collide and he never offered one victory without fighting just remember when you're standing in that valley of decision and the adversary says just give in oh just hold on my lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again [Music] cause i know within myself that i would truly perish oh but if i trust the mighty hand of god he'll shield those flames that the again would not get heavy or the hill would not be hard to climb oh he never offered one [Music] [Music] of decision and the adversary says just give in just hold on our lord he'll show up yes and he will take you through the fire again cause he never promised that the cross would not get [Music] he never offered victory without fighting he said help would always open time remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says given just hold on our lord will show up and he will take you through the fire again just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give it just hold on [Music] our lord will show up and he will take you [Music] oh i thank you lord i thank you lord i thank you lord [Music] are you in a valley of decision the adversary is all around you pushing against you poking at you trying to make you give up but you just hold

much you are tired like some of the rest of us we attended one of the longest weddings we've ever been to in our lives yesterday it was almost like an african reception because it just lasted into the wee hours of the night it felt like but we woke up this morning ready to be right back in the presence of the lord and what a beautiful day it was what a lovely day it was yesterday to worship god to feel the presence of the lord and his great seal as he come and solemnized our gathering and the vows that were made and we just are so happy for solomon and zion and we just believe that god will use them for his glory and uh they have enough advice and and enough charges and uh enough scripture spoken over them and blessings given to them they they can be very successful if they can just remember everything that you shared with them yesterday and uh what a wonderful time we had and greetings have come in for them from all over the world because the wedding was was streaming out and uh i just want to mention that uh their solomon's pastor and uh will be zion's pastor brother john andes from the church there he sent the most wonderful words compliments blessings about the service and the stream and what he experienced and the people that were streaming there in washington state and i sent him a little note back and when i got home last night i found another another wonderful greeting from him and that's how i do when i can't get something off my mind it comes back i just want to i want to say some more and it was a real encouragement to me personally and uh i believe that god will use them there in that assembly to one of you brothers go to the assembly of brother john andes or neither of you do one of you attends church with brother biskull is that right and and where do you attend church brother oh same place oh sometimes back and forth uh i call him curls and uh these are fine young men i will tell you that they're outstanding their their spirit i didn't know them i don't know very many people knew them but you know they didn't come in acting awkward and strange i love that they just came in and seemed to be themselves and that makes us comfortable and uh it just was a great great time and uh i appreciate joshua for going to get them this morning and bringing them from columbus over to the service and i appreciate the newlyweds giving them a place to stay tonight i think that's pretty outstanding of you all uh to be hosting guests already so that's wonderful benjamin and jenna leave tomorrow for their honeymoon somebody has to suffer for the lord in sunny you jamaica even call a resort a mission field can you but i think the lord can use them i think he can use them but they're there for lots of uh rest and relaxation and to get over all the stresses that come together when you're trying to uh plan a wedding it was a lovely reception the speeches were were really good and really special from from everyone the both fathers gave such wonderful summaries and uh observations about the young couple's lives and um solomon's sisters why they're they're almost comedians they did such an amazing job and even in the fun the presence of the lord was still there and we appreciated that and brother brother zig clar who pastors the church in edmonton and then brother stephen who's the assistant pastor out for brother andes we've known them for nearly 30 years and to be reacquainted like that was a real blessing and to be able to you know it's so nice when you can pick up where you left off and we just picked up where we left off and just went forward and uh we're looking forward to maybe more fellowship with them in the future and uh they that the elder cars had been uh away they had been on a cruise and they had been away from their home for two weeks and so their plans were to return today this afternoon and then the younger clars solomon's parents they start a food festival they do catering and they start a food festival tomorrow in edmonton and so they had to get back to be ready to start that this week and we're not able to be in service here with us but they both expressed that there they would have certainly liked to have been here and for me to greet you all so that's why i'm taking the time to do that we are very thankful i thank you you heard the gift that brother joshua llano has for singing how many of you believe that's more than a sing just a singer that's a gift most of us can carry a tune but that's a gift and i really enjoyed it and i really appreciate it and i i i refrained myself but i wanted to just scream out in the middle of it he's a keeper because uh we we really appreciate the and the song you know this is this isn't just a song that a writer wrote somewhere this is his testimony he was singing his testimony and uh all the goodness of god all the wonderful grace of god to all of us and so um if there are any other formalities that we're missing then you will forgive us there are a few celebrations this week and we might might take a moment to mention them and today is our good friend benita's birthday and of course she's not here we spent time with her in texas

this service in south africa your birthday is on tuesday just to let you know and we want to say happy birthday to you and we love you and we appreciate uh your fellowship with this church through the years and we greet all of the streamers there are many watching today british columbia the netherlands israel across the states trinidad pakistan it goes on and on may god bless every one of you iceland and i don't guess arizona is a foreign country but we appreciate all of you brother jim it's nice that you're on today he's wishing us a good sunday we're already having that thank you for your greetings let's go to the word is that all right let's stand together i know you've been up and down and bones get sore but if you're able let's honor god's word this way let's go all the way back to the beginning is that all right let's go to genesis chapter one i love preaching from these verses for some of you this might feel a little bit like a re-run i i wonder if anyone has ever watched an episode of let's just say little house on the prairie more than once well my children growing up didn't have television but they had some videos allowed them and when they got stuck on something they would watch it until they could memorize the parts and they could tell you who said what next and i'm sure they're not the only ones that have ever watched something this series that's out now the chosen i have watched almost every episode two or three times the more i watch it the more i understand who's who it takes me a while i i didn't get it going through i couldn't remember faces to names but i've been so inspired by different parts of it and aspects of it until i've enjoyed watching it repeat and uh how many of you have ever read a book more than once sure i have to i have to read something one or two times sometime to get the full impact of it especially when someone can really write and i like to read something like that but it takes a little effort and a little time so if this uh feels like a rerun to some of you well uh okay that's all right but i'm very aware that we have a new congregation and we have many new ones among us now and we have many new ones streaming for the first time someone at the wedding yesterday from another place said brother shelley the best thing you ever did was open up your stream so that people could watch without having to go through the password and all of that it does offer people some some ability to be anonymous and it makes it easier it's just a more easy effort just to click and start watching and so may god let his word go forth today to those who haven't heard these thoughts may it be new and fresh and alive and catch their heart and may god take the rest of us drive it a little deeper than it's ever been before because we're getting ready for the rapture we're getting ready for the lord to come and get those that are his and he's dressing us in the revealed word of god this is the bridal garment amen in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth period and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters i like the language of the king james there the spirit of god moved upon the face the surface of the waters i can almost see it when i read those words and it goes on and god said let there be light and guess what there was light because whatever god says it happens all you need is a word from god for your life and it happens and by the way he's still a walking talking god he didn't stop talking when the old testament prophets died he still talks today amen and even though we may not have a major word prophet in our land anymore we are thankful that there is a fivefold ministry and there are apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists after the order of ephesians they're with the body and when god speaks it happens may not happen when you want it to happen but he's always right on time and so god saw the light and it was good what's the hebrew word there tov toph it it doesn't just mean good it means complete it means whole it means doing what god created it to do so the light was good it was complete it was whole and it was manifesting the purpose of its creation isn't that powerful and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day now i think you might pay attention a little more if you if you stand for a few more moments and let me read this in the amplified if you will and then we'll have our seat same five verses in the beginning god prepared formed fashion and created the heavens and the earth the earth was without form and an empty waste and darkness was upon the face of the very great deep the spirit of god was moving hovering brooding over the face of the waters you're getting an image if you're listening and god said let there be light and there was light and god saw that the light was good suitable pleasant and he approved it and god separated the light from the darkness and god called the light day in the darkness he called night and there was evening and there was morning one day let's pray together oh father how we love to read these precious words of earth's creation we just come away every time in our hearts remembering what a mighty god what an awesome god what a supreme god what a sovereign god you are we stand in awe of who you are we bow our lives before you in reverential fear because we know that you are everything your word says that you are and you have chosen o precious papa you have chosen to condescend you came to this earth as a man to secure our salvation and redemption and once again you have chosen to condescend to fill people with your essence with your spirit with who you are and so we stand here today as a body as a bride as a company of sons we stand here today as your vessels as your temples as your reflection for once again you have chosen to inhabit even mortal flesh you live in us we are not carrying just a representative of who you are it's the very life you told us so jesus in your word we were told that that when you would come the father comes with you and that you would not leave us without a comforter but you would come and live inside of us we acknowledge that you have kept your word and you have inhabited the people by the power of the holy ghost and we give you glory and honor for that we rebuke the devourer we take authority over darkness we smite you in the mighty name of jesus and remove you from this place in the authority of the king of kings and the lord of lords we ask that the word of god be quickened to us and that we be anointed both to give it and to receive it in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen and the church said you may be seated what a good god we serve i want to talk to you this morning and preach to you and teach you a little bit i want us to to talk about some things i want us to examine some things i recognize that even among church going folk even among people who have spent their entire lives in church brother billy mentioned yesterday at the reception and i mentioned in the ceremony that zion grace her mother was in labor with her in a watch night service at the old church in columbus and participated in her mother's belly in a jericho march that night and sister laurel began to go into labor and because she's such a dutiful servant she just kept playing the piano just playing right on just doing everything that she could in fact making us a little bit nervous but she was all right she had peace and you know you can't get any more uh you can't say about somebody that they've been in church all their life any more than you can a circumstance like that and and i'm old enough to remember that in the old days at the holiness church that i grew up in i want you to know those were real women i mean i don't know they hadn't had all this hybrid food that people eat today they didn't they just come to church they shouted all over the room praise god serve the lord went into labor and more than once i'm not exaggerating more than once we'd see a little commotion as the sisters would take a sister out big swell belly they would take her out to the sunday school room church never stopped preacher never stopped preaching saints never stopped worshiping and i hate to tell you this daddy never got up he just stayed on his pew hey man brother preach on brother he never got up in a few minutes mama come walking out i'm telling you the truth a few minutes mama come walking out with a baby and a blanket and she made her a little jericho march around the service yes sir daddy jumped up and run around to see his little baby and walk with her giving god praise brother those were the days anybody going to help me a little bit you don't remember it those were the days they weren't going to miss church to have a baby and just like brother billy said zion was right back not even 24 years 24 hours old right back in service these are the ways of people who have sold out their lives to the kingdom of god don't tell me god can't help you don't tell me he can't strengthen you he will if you let him amen if you let your talk talk and your walk walk line up with the word god will honor your testimony oh my even those that have been in church though all their lives sometimes have an identity crisis and they fail to know who they are and they failed to understand why they were born if i were to take a little survey you better stay awake if i were to take a little survey here this morning and ask you do you know the reason that you were born do you know why you were born maybe you would say like the old song i was born to serve the lord and i agree with you 100 you were born to serve the lord that's exactly right that's why we're here to reflect who he is to give him our all to lead our families in the ways of righteousness and truth amen to live a dedicated and sanctified life apart from the pleasures of this whole world and shine for jesus everywhere we go and all the time can anybody say amen but i think it's important sometime for a person to have a revelation to really begin to understand why you are here and who you really are i want to talk about this morning just a little bit i want to talk about who you really are i want you to understand just just you're scratching the surface but i want you to understand who you are and where you came from i want you to know your origin i want you to know you you're older than your birthday i want you to know you existed before you were ever born in the mind of god i'm not a mormon and i don't believe in the pre-existence of souls but i do believe that we pre-existed in the mind of god we were his thoughts we were among his attributes and we were there in a form that had the ability to praise him then i don't know what it looked like i don't understand it all but i know that the sons of god they danced and shouted before the lord in eternity's past maybe by some expression or maybe only in the thought processes of the living god but it blesses me to know that i was a praiser before i was ever born it blesses me to know that i acknowledged and worshiped the creator before i was ever expressed on the earth you see i've recognized who i am i've recognized where i come from and i've recognized what my duty what my commission what my mandate here is on planet earth and i want every one of you to be able to experience that for yourselves you can't catch it it's not contagious but you can understand that it's possible and in fact it's nearly necessary for you to understand that you are here for a purpose i think in the world sometime in the in the movement of of self-improvement and personal development i think sometimes they call it finding your why i can relate to that that doesn't offend me i want you to know your why i want you to know why you were born i want you to know why you were born now i want you to know why you're living in this age come on now i want you to know that god placed you here not just to be a husband not just to be a wife not just to be a hard worker but he placed you here for a purpose for a calling for a reason it's not just preachers that have commissions every true son of god is here on a mandate you are here on a commission you are here for a reason that's why our decisions matter that's why who we marry matters that's why what we name our children matters because we're not here to live our best life we're here to live his life we're here to express who he is we're not here to walk like the world and talk like the world and dress like the world and do what the world does we're called to be a separated holy peculiar nation and i know some people take that peculiar a little far you just plain out weird strange that's not what he's talking about you know i'm preaching to myself when i say that because i find myself to be one of the strangest people i've ever known somebody said i don't really understand you i don't want you to i don't expect you to because sometimes i don't even understand myself but i tell you what i am what i am by the grace of god you tell those people that talk about me and say he speaks in tongues too much you just go tell him that the first church age messenger said i speak in tongues more than ye all if that's the only accusation that somebody can bring against me he talks in tongues too much he dances too much he shouts too much he gets too excited i'll be all right i don't always understand myself but i know that i'm here for a reason let me tell you something else i know about me and you we're not going anywhere not by cancer not by heart disease not by covet not at the other end of a gun until he calls us yeah you know some leaders some some some very respected people in the in the charismatic and pentecostal faith world passed away particularly one pastor's wife passed away this week and i never met them but i met their son and uh he led worship in in a conference where i was speaking in canada and i enjoyed meeting them very much and this is a place where faith is really taught strong and and uh where they have believed that god could then would make their community a cancer-free zone and they were just believing for for great uh manifestations of god's power and i love that i'm not against that but but without even with all the prayer and even with all the intercession and even with all the positive words this woman passed away this week and i get so shocked sometime at how social media responds supposed to be believers and you know what they just ripped into the church ripped right into the church i so long for supposed to be friends of mine long discourses about when is the church going to pray the prayer of faith and when is the church going to realize that how many more do we have to lose and how many more is satan going to steal and how many more is he going to kill you know that makes me fighting mad spitting man i it takes everything i can do to keep to to keep from getting in the social media wars because i want to say wait a minute i'm not going to preach a god who's weaker than the devil he created [Music] [Applause] wished i had some help i'm not going to preach about a god who creates an enemy and lets him have more power authority than himself the devil will try the devil will try the devil will try he'll try to kill you he'll try to afflict you he'll try to bankrupt you but he cannot touch you unless god allows when i die if i die when i die no matter how i die i want you to know he called me if i go down lay down to go to sleep and don't wake up he called me if some vicious thing lays a hold on my body he called me if some madman comes to snuff me out he called me i don't believe the devil can kill a true son of god [Applause] i don't even believe he can give me a headache if god doesn't allow it and if god allows it guess what he supplies the healing i need oh i'm preaching and the grace i need [Music] don't you blame the church and tell them they didn't pray enough oh if you'd only prayed more oh i'm just getting started i know i'm wading through deep water because the sweat's running down the middle of my back i know i'm getting into some deep water now i just i'm not going to buy that theology that's not bible theology i believe in the sovereignty of god i believe you're here because god wanted you here don't you tell me i just decided to come visit you did not decide you thought it was your idea you're here because for some reason god wanted you in this place you see i've got confidence in you i've got confidence in you that you've followed some nudge i've got confidence that god ordained for you and i to be gathered this way today and there's a reason for it and there's a purpose for it and we may never be gathered just like this again so we've got to make the most of this moment we've got to squeeze until we get everything out of this service that god wants for us today because tomorrow will be too late to get what god had for us today he's got an appointment with his children there's a season for his children and we want to stay up we want to keep up with what god's doing we want to bar are you with me i just felt somebody slipping we want to march to the drumbeat of heaven we want to move in synchronization with every frequency and every movement that takes place in the throne of god yes we want to live our lives as those led by the spirit of the lord you've got to know you've got to know you're not here because your daddy had a twinkle in his eye you're not here because a man seduced a woman are a woman seduced a man you're here right now in this age in this hour because god wanted you to live he didn't want you to live in the bible day over there he didn't want you to live in the ephesian church age you were not to be expressed in the philadelphia church smyrna and thyatira and sardisian you were to be born in the age of laodicea which is the last age which means we're closer to eternity oh we're so close to eternity now that just like tuesday night josh when the presence of the lord came unexpectedly you mean you didn't expect his presence to be no i expected him to be here but not like that when i stepped up here to this pulpit he began to pull me and i could feel a portion of who i was leaving my body and i want you to know to navigate that kind of of coexistence between heaven and earth between that realm and this realm i i'll never get used to it i'll never grow accustomed to it and i may never be any better at handling it than i am now but i repented the next day i spent the day with brother josh there alano and uh spent eight hours with him in fact that day and i repented to him and i said i've just felt so bad because i i i think there was something god wanted to do and and somehow i got my mind on on on people and and streamers and and and those who would be expecting some some scripture and and i know we need that and i know the prophet has given us an order and i know that he says no service is complete without the reading of a scripture to take them and all of it i understand all that but but somehow i felt that i i missed it but i as i reflected the next day i didn't know what i could have done different either but i just wasn't satisfied with how i responded i just wanted to fly i'll just be honest with you we don't live by feelings but i just really wanted to take wing i feel the pull i didn't didn't you post the words of that elias i feel the pull i hear the call i know his spirit is bidding me to give my all he speaks to me and i agree lord please come and take control i feel the pool how many of you love to feel the pull of the spirit the drawing of the holy ghost the presence of the lord that gives us life it seems perhaps that that was transferring somehow tangibly out of this place yesterday when we were assigning the marriage certificate and my kids were singing the blessing and that that anointing was going out and i had just a string of messages and private messages and texts that said the anointing was just filling the room where we were it was just filling the room brother clark said to me i've never been in a more lovely service in all my life where the presence of the lord came in a wedding like that he said it was just outstanding and it was indeed and we need him we need him the church sometimes condemns us and they say you're always talking about a feeling but you don't understand we're not living by feelings we're living by faith but he wants us to experience him in reality and in real now i'm so sick of religion [Applause] i'm so sick of church entity i want realness i want reality i want jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i got to preach i've got to preach on i got to move on i've got to go on now when we get to genesis 1 3 and god said let there be light what we're reading about is most likely the restoration of the prior creation now we don't have time to go into every aspect of this but yes i am one of those neanderthal christians who believes that there was a pre-adamic existence i'm one of those antiquated christians that believes that there was a gap in theology it's sometimes called the gap theory and i'm one of those so just so you'll know i'm an antique and i believe in the in the idea that there was a gap between genesis 1 1 and genesis 1 2. i believe that when god made the earth he did not originally form it to be formless and void i have studied the nature of god throughout the writings of the prophets of the old testament and should i have time i can read you some of the comments that they make in scripture about the nature of god's creative ability and power and there is nothing in me that feels or sees in the word that god is in the business of creating something in darkness in void in waste in chaos i believe that the mind of god is the most ordered environment in all eternity there's no confusion god's never at an aha moment nothing has ever caught him by surprise do i have anybody to preach to he's always moving just as he thought he should everything planned and everything orderly and so what we read that is that in in in all likelihood there was something that took place and we know by scripture should we be able to get to it if not we'll close it up on tuesday night but we know that satan had this ambition he was no longer satisfied just to rule over the the baby creation of earth he realized i i can have more i can be more i will exalt my throne i'll get myself up above the throne of god he had great ambition and may i just remind you that even that did not take god by surprise did you know when judas was born god already knew what he was you know when judas's mother held him in her arms and loved him and nursed him and wooed him god already knew he was a betrayer did you know that when satan was created god already knew what would be in him how do you think it got there when god took eve out of adam don't you know he already knew what he would do where do you think that got in her how do you think that was ever in her in the first place it was in there because she was created thus judas was created thus cain was created thus we go right through the word we see the same manifestations today created us they're still twins in the earth there are still those being born who have already come with a prefix destiny so that they will when it's time to make a choice god saw by foreknowledge what their choice would be he did he didn't make their choice he allowed them a choice he saw their choice before they ever made their choice i'm just quoting new testament now he saw their i'm getting ahead saw their choice and based on their choice he fixed them prefixed them a destiny that's the very meaning of the word predestination having a prefix destiny so god already knows he already knows your uprisings and your downfallings he already knows where you're going to end up come on who you're going to end up with what's going on and he loves you oh this is incredible he loves you you know if we were to go back and dig under the blood and try to pull some things up there's some rotten things in this room none of it took god by surprise none of that sin took god by surprise oh he saw he saw your your predisposition he saw your generational stuff before you were ever born don't you think god saw it coming down through the bloodlines don't you think he knew that if addiction was coming down through your bloodline that it would touch your life in some way but he already made a plan to get you out i'm telling you right now he has already made a plan to get you out just because daddy wasn't granddad he wasn't great-granddad he wasn't great-great-granddaddy was does it mean you have to be because we are awakening to who we are and why we were born we do not come in our own authority and power we come in the power and the authority of the lord jesus christ king of all kings and lord of all lord are you here praise god so what we read in genesis 1 verses 3 through 31 is really the restoration of the earth back to a similar original condition before it was made formless and void and submerged in darkness and water because of satan's rebellion so i want you to see an earth made perfect and i want you to see a created cherub who was commissioned to have authority over this newly created earth and lucifer the the old testament tells us lucifer walked among he walked around he walked in the midst of the earth and he had dominion he had been in heaven he had been something like a choir director or a music leader he was thus created that even the form of his body made music we're looking at hebrew in hebrew we discover that there were some sort of of pipes can you imagine having an organ in your body i don't mean a liver i mean a pipe organ in the hebrew it tells us that lucifer was so created that there was musical ability in his body so you people that were born with a groove nothing wrong with that music speaks moves some people in different ways than it does other people brother i can't be still you put a little holy ghost song on i can't be stealing i quit trying to be still because i feel it the church will try to church you the church will try to hold you back and the church will try to tell you don't dance like that don't jump like that don't holler amen like that don't wave a flag like that don't you just love how how we have worshiped police don't you just love how there's praise police i i just wish we didn't have them always trying to tell somebody else how how they can praise the lord and what's real praise and what's ordered praise and what's not praying you want to know what kind of praise god responds to the kindness mentioned in the book of psalms shout your praise speak your praise sing your praise do it standing do it kneeling do it laying down raise your hand clap your hand play instruments with your hands let everything that happen oh oh [Applause] let everything that i pray let everything that have breath let everything that happens praise the lord praise the lord praise the lord we are not ashamed we're not ashamed to praise the lord be seated hallelujah it's just simply not in the nature of god to create something incomplete and imperfect give me isaiah 45 18. whoo my my my my my my my my that was beginning to feel like a praise break [Music] i can do all that without the organ glory glory glory glory glory glory well what good did that do well if nothing else it got some of your blood running through your body [Applause] put a little color in your cheek some of you needed it get your heart pumping a little bit get you ready to hear a little more of god's word isaiah 45 18 for thus saith the lord that created the heavens god himself that formed the earth and made it he hath established it he listen he created it read it for me not in vain not in void not in chaos not in darkness not without phone he formed it what does it say to be inhabited you couldn't inhabit the earth you read about in in genesis 1 2 there where it talks about darkness covering the face of the no land shown just water everywhere in the holy spirit hovering over and cooing after and drawing drawing oh i feel him [Music] you couldn't have lived in an earth like that that earth was not inhabitable there was no land mass only darkness no light and if there was any light it was mixed the jewish people believed from the hebrew of that verse that in the beginning darkness and light was commingled in such a way that you couldn't see light but light was there all the time and in the hebrew when he calls let there be light the hebrew speaks of a separation that god was calling the light to come forward because god is light i don't know how it was i wasn't there but i know god drew the light out and it was good i know that he established he created it not in vain he formed it let's look at this in the amplified everybody's still here all right we're just getting ready to go into our number two in just a moment if you need a break take one isaiah 45 18 verse 18 in the amplified for thus says the lord who created the heavens god himself who formed the earth and made it who established it and did not create it to be a worthless waste there you go he formed it to be inhabited i am the lord and there is no one else so something happened now there are many people who believe who study the scripture who believe that peter was talking about this uh pre-or or a pre-adamic condition of the earth in ii peter there are some who believe that he was speaking about the flood in the days of noah but let's read it just for the record second peter 3 verses 5 through 7 there are many who study these things who believe that this was referring to the pre-adamic earth for if they willingly are ignorant of that word by the word of god the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men many scholars say that if this was not in in reference to the pre-adamic creation then it certainly could apply because the language in the greek is very carefully worded that makes it sound like more of a total annihilation than it does just the flooding of the earth nonetheless let's go to jeremiah 4 quickly i pray that all of my scripture reading doesn't lose you i pray you'll stay with me because you say i thought you're going to tell me who i am i am i am going to tell you but but if you check out now if you leave us now you you won't you won't hear it jeremiah 4 23 and 27 i behold the earth and lo it was without form and void and the heavens and they had no light i beheld the mountains and lo they trembled and all the hills moved lightly i beheld in low and there was no man and all the birds of the heavens were fled i beheld and lo the fruitful place was a wilderness and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the lord and by his fierce anger did anyone hear the phrase all the cities and by his fierce anger for thus hath the lord said the whole land shall be desolate yet will i not make a full end now again here is jeremiah prophesying telling us of something that has already happened and there are many people who believe of course that he was referring to the flood but those who study the language deeply find out that the writing and the way that the sentences are structured it sounds like something older than noah's flood i'll let you decide i'll let you decide but i'm reading them because i think it's a good idea for you to be aware of the whole picture if this is a picture of what was then it is clear that in that original creation in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth in that original creation it's clear that it was inhabited by some kind of creation something human-like and that there were organized societies perhaps cities it baffles the mind of men i remember as a child in the holiness church the old preachers used to tell us dinosaurs didn't exist they preached it fervently it's a lie of the enemy it's it's an evolution lie it came from the pit of hell dinosaurs did not exist and all the people said amen then they start digging up these bones and the old preacher said they made them i'm not making fun brother we need we may not need that kind of preaching but we needed some of the preaching they did we need to hear some of what they had to say they could help us clean the church today couldn't they yeah they were preaching it all they knew all they knew they preached and they said oh no they said i don't believe adam wrote on the back of a dinosaur so he said they never existed well i want you to know they did clearly exist they're finding bones that no one has made and and i want you to allow me to present to you that it's my understanding of this study that these are some of the creatures that existed in the original earth as it was created before it was plunged into a chaotic condition so whatever lived whatever had society whatever formed cities they did it among these prehistoric creatures was it a million 30 million 50 billion i i i have no idea when it was the earth as we know it now is most likely slightly over 6 000 years old but that original earth and the gap between one and two we have no idea how long it was and we're not going to spend any time arguing or trying to figure it out i want to take you to ezekiel 28 for just a moment and i want you to stay with me i want you to see this creature i want you to hear this quickly i just wish there weren't so many verses to read but i want to read them because i want you to have reference if you need to go back to this later ezekiel 28 verse 11 moreover the word of the lord came unto me saying i'm going to verse all the way to verse 19. son of man take up a lamentation upon the king of tyre and say unto him thus saith the lord god thou seelest up the sum full of wisdom and perfect in beauty thou hast been in eden the garden of god every precious stone was thy covering i want you to know gaudy is not a new thing amen lucifer was a reflection of god's beauty for even in his covering the sardius topaz diamond barrel onyx jasper sapphire emerald carbuncle gold the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created that's your enemy it's your enemy he wasn't your enemy in that moment he was leading worship thou art the anointed cherub that covered we know this is not referring to an earthly king of tyre but an earthly king of tyre was being compared to this original cherub that covereth thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have set thee so that thou wasted upon the holy mountain of god thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire thou was perfect in thy ways is anybody clear we're reading about the enemy in thy ways from the day that thou was created till iniquity was found in thee by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence and thou has sinned and therefore i will cast the s profane out of the mountain of god i will destroy thee o covering cherub from the midst of the stones of fire thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty amen don't you try to tell me i'm supposed to call june pride month pride was the beginning of this problem pride is what was wrong with sodom and gomorrah in the first place it wasn't homosexuality first it was pride first that led to man worship and people worshiping their own body and their own image just like they do today so this is where it started this pride got in the heart lucifer was no longer my goodness he was the most beautiful thing that god created he had the most unique ability when he walked among the stones of fire his body sang praise can you imagine as he moved around the throne originally every part of his being was to the glory and the honor of god but one day he caught his reflection he caught his reflection he saw how beautiful he was and he went back to take another look and another look and another look and another look and another look at another look until finally he thought he was the most beautiful thing that there was and he was indeed that created to be such and he said i don't have to be the second man i don't have to be the third one in control i don't have to be somewhere down a long line of line of uh yes man no no no no no i i'm more beautiful than the rest of them he said uh he was he became corrupted thy heart was lifted up because of thy beauty thou has corrupted by thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will cast thee to the ground i will lay thee before kings that they may behold thee brother i'm living for that day revelation tells us the same scenario he's going to lay there and the kings of the earth are going to see his defeat all the eternals are going to see his defeat thou has to file thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities by the iniquity of thy traffic therefore will i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee there's something you need to know if god didn't create it to be eternal if it was created with the absence of eternal life it cannot be eternal when the scripture talks about his utter destruction it means what it says the same bible says the soul that sinneth shall surely die hell is horrible place and it burns with the fire and at last we have no idea of knowing for how many millions or billions of years the torment might be but the flames are not the greatest part of of hell that is not the greatest torment we think it is because of how we feel about fire but the eternal part of the punishment is not the flame itself the most horrendous and eternal part of the punishment is eternal separation from the presence of god i want you to know even sinners can recognize the presence of god and that hour that hour that they no longer have any connection at all i spoke about those who move by music i want you to know that music is one of the ways that even sinners can connect to the presence of god but once you land in hell that that connection is over it's voided and you are eternally separated from the presence of god therefore the the punishment itself is an eternal doing but the created place it has a duration it has an expiration and so does your enemy now we're just preaching what the bible said you've got a problem with that i know your church don't teach it that way your preacher may not preach it that way i'm not here to do any of those those things i'm here to tell you what the bible's saying not church tradition what the bible said you don't want to go there you want to stay out of there one day your enemy has an end the only way something can live eternal is to have eternal life and lucifer doesn't have eternal life one of these days is going to burn up in his own wickedness yes the scripture said it shall devour there will be a fire being brought forth from the midst of thee it shall devour thee and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee you just let the saints of god walk by you imagine that day when the saints of god will walk back to and fro and behold the pile of ashes anybody with me that used to be their arch enemy the one that used to give you the most trouble the one that used to torment your mind the one that tried to steal this from you and torment you and addict you and pull you here and pull you there and one day you'll walk past is this the pile of ashes that cause the nations to reel and rock is this the pile of ashes that destroyed churches that ruined nations no more no more god will ultimately deal with that devil your enemy and all they that know thee among the peoples shall be astonished at thee not because of your great glory anymore thou shalt be a terror and never shout thou be [Music] nobody's with me nobody did not just read it out of the book does that not matter anymore matters now go to isaiah 14. by the time i get to my punch line you're going to be napping isaiah 14 verse 12 how art thou fallen from heaven oh lucifer sun in the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did its weakened the nations for thou hast said in thine heart all the way to twenty for thou has said in thine heart i will ascend into heaven i will exalt my name above the stars of god i will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides of the north i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will be like the most high is anybody getting all those eyes you ever around anybody that talks like that i i i i i i i there's something wrong with that conversation i thought you'd help me a little better than that no i'm going to take a break let you think about it i will do this i will make my name i will i will ascend i will i will be like the most high god yet thou shall be brought down to hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee and consider thee saying is this the man who is this the one that made the earth to tremble that did shake kingdoms anybody realizing what we're reading here that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof you see that open not the house of his prisoners all the kings of the nations even all of them lie in glory everyone in his own house but thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch and as the ramen of those that are slain thrust through with a sword that go down to the stones of the pit as a carcass trodden underfoot my god my god he's going to deal with the enemy thou shalt not be joined with them in burial because those destroyed thy land and slain thy people the seed of evil doers shall never be renowned there'll be no memory there'll be no memory of them there'll be no memory of them do you understand i know these old songs tear jerking songs that have been written about getting to heaven and realizing your loved ones aren't there are you joking with me are you kidding with me if there's somebody in your family circle that don't make it over there you'll never miss them i thought i'd give them more help with that you'll never miss them i can't imagine brothership you'll never know they existed amen what kind of heaven what kind of eternity would it be if every time you looked around and saw those you were familiar with realize mama wasn't there or daddy wasn't there or some of your maybe your husband wasn't there what kind of eternity would that be you'll never remember them anymore you'll never remember your enemy anymore you'll never remember those who persecuted you anymore you'll never remember their names are blotted out of the book of life it is as though they never existed in all of time and eternity you hear what i just said there is a book your name can never be blotted out of that is the lamb's book of lie but there is a book yes there is a book your name can be removed from and it is as though you never existed you have no memory there is no history of your birth it is though it is as though you never were and this is our enemy's destiny as well it's you the evildoers and the seed of the evil doers shall never be renowned let's read on thou shall not be joined excuse me is that it that's verse 20. all right great give me ephesians 6 12 in the amplified please you need to stand in stretch does anybody need a stretch break yes no maybe so aren't we used to being here at 112 sam yes ma'am all right well we said but not when we have a a 12-hour wedding day that was yesterday that was yesterday it's a new day we made it here didn't we we got here didn't want to be anywhere else but here i didn't for we are not wrestling with flesh and blood contending only with physical opponents but against the deposit excuse me the devil i can't even see it despotism's against the powers against the master spirits who are the world rulers of this present darkness against the spirit forces of wickedness in the heavenly supernatural sphere we've got enemies we've got principalities and powers you believe that let me go and get this one in job 1 6-7 and you'll also read this in job 2-2 because the common teaching of the church of yesteryear that was that's was this that satan was banished to hell i've heard great sermons about satan and how he's banished to hell and all of the demons were banished to hell but how many of you know that couldn't exactly be the reality of things because we're wrestling right now and fighting right now with principalities and powers and spirits of the air spirit spirits and in you know high wickedness and and heavenly supernatural spheres that that other realm that other dimension is is more real than the one we're living in right now job 1 6-7 said now there was a day when the sons of god came to present themselves before the lord and satan came also among them and the lord said unto satan which cometh thou then satan answered the lord and said from going to and fro in the earth and from walking up and down in it so i wanted to show you that satan was not banished to hell after he was thrown out no no he was not banished to hell he had access to continue to roam in fact we understand that he's built a throne in the second heaven he is the prince of what the power of the air he dwells just above the atmosphere of earth and that's why there's darkness there and if you don't believe that go to the book of daniel and you'll find out that daniel prayed a prayer in an angels breaking through but he has to come through that sphere of darkness he has to fight principalities and powers the bible said specifically he comes against the prince of persia and he would be a he would have been held up there indefinitely but michael [Music] a great warring angel came and escorted that angel kicked his enemies off and escorted that angel through the second heaven so that he could break through into the atmosphere of earth and stand there by daniel and giving the word of the lord your prayer was heard oh he don't hear me he don't hear me because he hadn't talked to me he heard you don't you get discouraged he heard you oh daniel your prayer was heard the moment you prayed it but i was delayed in getting the answer to you i had to fight the prince of persia where is he talking about he's talking about that spear that that uh place that we refer to as the second heaven remember the apostle said i knew a man and he was caught up where not to the second heaven but to the third heaven so that spiritual dimension of light that realm of god and that which is holy and spiritual is above the second heaven it's in the region we would call the third heaven and anytime a word is passed from here to there it has to go through the second heaven and anytime deliverance passes from there to here it has to go through the second heaven i want you to know it's the busiest dimension the busiest atmosphere and the busiest dimension is the one between here and the throne there's a lot of activity there you never give a praise you never offer a prayer you never make any move toward god reaching out for more deliverance that it doesn't cause a ripple through that atmosphere i'm telling you the enemy is watching you there's more than one eye watching you but the one that matters has got you on his radar too and he knows how to overcome all principalities and power amen are you still with me then i want to remind you of one verse and we're fixing to bring this home genesis 1 2. i want to i want to remind you of this one this is genesis 1 1 was in the beginning he created the heaven and earth now genesis 1 2 and the earth was without form what caused the earth to be without form it's what we read to you in isaiah and ezekiel it was satan deciding on lucifer we should call him this lucifer deciding i'm not no longer satisfied to dwell in this realm i'm exalting myself come on started working on the angels didn't he all right so then god said i'm taking this creation even as it is now and i'm putting it on the back burner just like a woman would be would be cooking something and getting a little fast and getting a little head of the rest of the meal and she would take that pot and put it back to another burner that's what god was doing he said i'm not done with this creation i'm not nearly finished with this how many of you know there was a plan of redemption that had to come forward but god had a reason for it all working this way he was not only populating the regions of light but populating the regions of the darkness and that's a subject for another time but god plunged the earth into chaos it went into darkness its form became formless its organization became chaos the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deed but i want you to notice this and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters all that darkness all that chaos all that destruction underneath the water all that death underneath the water and what do you see you see the are you with me you see the gentle dove of the holy spirit i said are you with me he's just moving over the face of the waters all darkness the only light the only representation of good or god is that holy spirit brooding wooing cooing over the face of the waters would you give me the message what does it take to make a christian life i know they're visitors here i know we should call it short shorter for them but i'm not sure i can do that just now he said now i want you to notice in the beginning when god our father looked over this bleak earth and it wasn't nothing but one great big ball of water and god sent the holy spirit to the earth the logos that went out of god and what did it do it began to brood would you say the word brood with me brood have you ever used that word in your vocabulary my granny used to my granny used to use that word it refers we have it in the new testament jesus brooding he said how often i would have gathered you as a henwood or chicks but you would not you look at that in the original language it's talking about a hen brooding over her little ones i've heard my granny say don't mess with that hen she's got her brood underneath her her little hatchlings are there or she's brooding over her nest you leave her alone that's a mother guarding are you with me i'm going to say again are you with me i don't have time to tell this story but i'm telling it anyway brother r.c wetzel a great mentor and friend of mine who went to be with the lord now many years ago he told the story of being a child and the barn catching on fire remember me telling you and the barn caught on fire and the animals those that were able to get out survive but anything that wasn't able to get out of course it burned to the ground with the barn devastating to the family it was their livelihood it was their it was their winter feeding the food that would feed the animals in the winter was all lost in the barn it was a terrible terrible thing and when the when the fire had died down and the water was drying brother wetzel told the story of going out and he said the oddest thing i've ever seen in my life was laying right there in the doorway of the barn was a scorched hen no more than a pile of feathers and he said i thought to myself you dumb hen you dumb chicken why didn't you run a little farther why did you just lay down there and die he said i was just a boy and it just baffled me at the ignorance of that little bird if she'd had gone out a little further and beat her wings in the sand she might have been able to save her life but yet she just bowed down there in the doorway and died in the dirt he said i didn't really mean any disrespect but he said i just was so drawn to this picture he said i took the edge of my shoe and i kicked over the carcass of that little old mother hen and that old dried frame of bones and feathers rolled off and out from underneath her came a little brood of little chickens i must be getting old i must be getting old because that touches my heart i know old people love little baby animals i must be getting old i can see those little chickens running out from mama and he said oh my mama i'm so sorry i called you stupid i'm so sorry that i called you dumb i know exactly why you died right there you died gathering your little babies under your way you gave your life you're hearing me you gave your life for those little chickens there so i know what brooding means you're getting it now drawing and well here we go and god sent the holy spirit to the earth the logos that went out of god and it began to brood over the earth help me lord to hurry now now the word brood means to make love just like the dove to coo [Music] to call to draw are you here in the great holy spirit benjamin would you go and see if you can find a rag a towel anything my handkerchief is soaked through and i need something dry i'm wiping my sweat with a wet wet rag now the word brood means to make love or just like the dove to cool the great holy spirit over the earth is a mental picture we're going to make it like wings let's see it can you see it with me we're going to make the holy spirit like wing we're going to see him like a dove and we're going to see that great darkness far as you can see out there darkness darkness darkness and deep deep water nobody knows just how deep it is and underneath the surface of that water is whatever remains from god's original creation maybe down underneath that waters it's trees apple trees and peach trees and whatever i don't know what the original creation looked like i don't know what those societies look like i don't know what the greek i don't know but underneath there would be the big bodies of some dinosaurs or whatever was under there there's only one way it could have got there god had to create it and god created them the same way he creates now you're with me he doesn't create like a potter creates with his hands he creates like a creator creates he creates with his mouth i wish somebody was with me he creates with his mouth whatever was lying there underneath that water in that darkness in that chaos was what god had created with the power of the spoken word stay with me and whatever it was it was of such value to god that he sent the holy spirit to go down can you see it is that a dishcloth whatever we have thank you very much i'll have to dig out my africa rags i've got rags from africa i wish this one smelt a little better that smells like my granny's kitchen that reminded me i don't know what it was about granny's kitchen little fried chicken maybe we're going to make it like wings with his great wings around the earth brooding making love cooing come come the father oh lord of mercy come come the father has ordained you come what is he calling do what is the holy spirit calling to come come i'm coming to perform what the father's word has said is it soaking in the prophet asked is it soaking in i have come [Music] to manifest what the father has spoken anybody with me wake up now come on come on i don't want you to miss this if you need to leave if your time has expired slip out quietly but if you stay get with me now i don't want you to miss why you're here i don't want you to miss while you were born you weren't just born to be a sibling in your family or a child or your parents to choose a career and a spouse and have babies and whatever life looks like you are here to manifest what the father hath spoken you are a part of what the father has spoken [Music] you're with me you he goes on brood he said after a while there this is the recreation after a while there began to come some petroleum moving across the earth and a little bit of this and that in a little easter lily comes up in the earth what brought it now what was the holy spirit brooding over the seed where did the seed come from the spoken word is the original seed everything that was in that original earth had come from the mouth of god so it was still lying under the surface of that dark water in seed form remember brother branham said every apple that's ever ever apple that's ever going to be in the earth was a part of that original creation he's not talking about adam's recreation he's talking about that original creation and the seed he said why in that little seed what's the potential of every other apple and every other tree and it lay there and it would have just drowned just lay there drowning had the holy spirit not come to brood over it and to woo it and call it forth and tell it what it was there for you're there you're there because you're part of the spoken creation of the father and i am wooing you thank you i smell a little better good i'm wooing you i am calling you i am drawing you what was you drawing the seed what was he watching over his word [Music] he's jealous over his word glory be to god he wasn't even going to let satan destroy that i might let this thing slow down a little bit i may push the earth to the back burner a little bit i may slow this this whole process down a little bit but i'm not going to leave my word i'm not going to leave my seed unguarded under that dark water no no no no no i'll sin for my holy spirit [Applause] to make love over my word to coo and draw and brood over my word whoa come on come on let me hear you another minute hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] here come little easter lilia who brought it the holy spirit brooding then come along the dahlia the azalea [Music] oh i'm so glad he brought in southern vegetations do yankees even know what azaleas are i don't know i guess they do do you sister kathy did you know what the zeldas were ah but not like ours no they're not but all beautiful the azaleas and the other bushes begin they begin to draw up out of the hutaye they began to draw about the vegetation then came the vegetation the holy spirit's still brooding still calling the seeds of the original creation to come forth into manifestation i said still calling the seeds of the original creation that which came forth from the spoken mouth of god because the spoken word of god is the original seed somebody said what came first the chicken or the egg the chicken dummy because the chicken came forth from the spoken word of god and the seed was in her the egg was in there [Applause] somebody said what converts an apple seed or a tree with apple a tree with apples that's how it was in the original now we've just got what's left of that original creation notice god didn't call it all he didn't call the dinosaurs back he didn't call pre-adamic man or creature or beast or whatever it was he didn't call all that back although please remember i don't want to try to insert some strange doctrine here but please remember that there was an unusual creature in the garden that no one seemed to quite understand beast but very manlike just interesting to note some representation perhaps of some existence i know some of you are getting so nervous because you think you're you know this is some false doctrine or something we're removing oh no no no no no okay did i finish that no uh then the long came after the vegetation came the trees then the plant life let me just dry off the cord that's where we have our shorts and problems it's that cord in the back then after a while birds begin to fly from the dust of the earth the earth starts raising up dry land starts coming forth come on the holy spirit wooing these things begin to rise from the depths of the sea the birds begin to fly from the dust of the earth my wouldn't you have loved to have seen it the holy spirit brooding them together sent them into the air then along came the animal life the holy spirit brooding any animal that was in that original creation it came forth in the recreation now if you've got any problem with the fact that there was something living in the original earth you must also look at what god told adam when it come time to have babies he didn't say be fruitful and multiply and plenish the earth which would mean to fill it up he said be fruitful and multiply and what replenish repopulate refill the earth so something had already filled the earth anybody with me oh god he's a mastermind there's no mind like the mind of god he had all of this in his mind then along came the animal life the holy spirit brooding are you there so so let me ask you this question just what was the spirit of god doing as he moved over the surface of the water he was not only moving and brooding over the water it's clear that he was guarding something what could it be what was beneath the surface of the waters that god sent his own spirit to watch over for an undisclosed number of years we have no idea how long the spirit was guarding the seed we have no idea uh if i had time i don't have time i'll read it maybe later genesis 1 11 and 12 has a very similar uh oh let me read it come on folks and god said in the amplified let the earth put forth tender vegetation plants yielding seed and fruit trees there's your dahlias your azaleas and all this this plant life just like the prophet was preaching it and fruit trees yielding fruit whose seed is in itself here come a tree that unless it had seed in it it would die out but when god put the tree there he put all the seed in it so that it could reproduce itself spoken word is the let's see that again spoken word is oh my goodness i love this book this is life the seed is in itself each according to its kind upon the earth and it was so the earth brought forth vegetation plants yielding seeds seed according to their own kinds and tree trees bearing fruit in which was their seed each according to its kind and god saw that it was good suitable admirable and he approved it can i go to the fourth seal lord have mercy how will i stop 92 paragraph 92 of the fourth seal i was talking to a person not long ago i was trying to discuss this is the clinker if any of you needed to hear it in the in the prophet's message here's the clinker are you ready to write this down you can write this address down this is in the message the fourth seal march the 21st 1963 in the grand city of jeffersonville and i'm doing that because this is a quote that i lose sometime i have to call brother greeley to find it for me again but i've put it in my notes here i think this is the one yeah this is the one now i lose it sometimes so i don't want you to lose it i may need to call you sometime and you remind me where it is i was talking to a person not long ago was trying to discuss with me and saying aren't you ashamed to say that god created the heavens and earth in three days or in six days i said that that's what the bible said all right let's go on said well we got evidence and can prove that the world is millions of years old i said that didn't have anything to do with it now my that's a scientific answer is that that didn't have anything to do with it he said in genesis 1 1 this is the prophet talking back to this gentleman he's speaking with he said in genesis 1 1 it said in the beginning god created the heavens and earth help me all you students of the message what said next period i'm not sure brother brandon believed things like period i'm not the only one who believes the gap theory period he said that's all see now the world was out form and void and i said i believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization or something and as soon as the water lifted off and the light struck it up come the trees and everything isn't that good and the same thing with the human being is a type when all the mist had moved away and the revealed truth to that real seed laying there it's still germatized that's me he's talking about and the light of the gospel can strike it by true vindication of the word it'll live hallelujah [Applause] it doesn't matter what age you came in all it takes is for the light to strike the seed he said it's got life in it i'll believe it'll believe it'll believe outside of that it can't live it hasn't got no life in it so how many of you can at least say you hear brother venom saying that underneath that water let's go back and look at that part again i believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization or something and as soon as the water lifted the spirit of god been guarding it all this time wooing brooding calling to it and when that light begin to shine it draws up oh my gosh let's praise god in here come on let's praise him [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] i'll call the musician shortly i want you to go to ephesians 1 getting ready to bring this to you bring it home we've we've made seven pages here we're doing excellent tuesday night i'll come in here with some more quotations for you but ephesians 1 3 through 12. that's a lot of reading but i want to get it in here i want you to listen for you i want you to listen for you in this i want to see if you can find you in this this is ephesians this tells our story this is a part of our exodus paralleling joshua it's paralleling the exodus this is part of our story blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ are you still in accordance come on come on is this the same bible they use over there is this the same bible how do people miss it according as he hath chosen us in him how do people miss that how does the church miss that how do denominations miss this it's it's like your nose on your face playing according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world you didn't just get to be his you were his in his mind before the foundation of the world you know i used to pastor one of those pentecostal denominational churches right down the road there in phoenix city and i got called into conference one time for using that word predestination right there in the king james version of the new testament years ago i was 16 years old and i'm called on the spot for using a bible word and they said we don't like to use that word predestination and i said well what have you got against the word well it just causes people to believe all kinds you know there's that that thin line between hyper calvinism and calvinism and we're just you know that's not how we like to look at it we want to emphasize your choice we want people to make sure they understand that they have a choice and i said do you if you just read this carefully you'll find out that everyone has a choice but a big old sovereign god knew my choice before i made it he knew exactly what i was going to say he knew my yes hallelujah let me tell you church he knew your yes he didn't force you to say yes he knew your yes and because of your yes he chose you he elected you he predestinated you we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame and before him in love can i tell you that before genesis 1 1 you were already chosen in christ that's the foundation of the world genesis 1 1. there it is that's where it's talked about before genesis 1 1 having predestinated us prefixed our destiny unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will my this is a long service to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved lord of mercy you know how i love to preach on that verse oh i just want god to accept me i just wanna know that he loves me what's the word say give me the verse go back to the praise of the glory of his grace there's no praise for you you're wonderful but we're not praising you because you serve god it's the glory of his grace if anybody's serving him it's the glory of his grace wherein he hath done what made us anybody still with me made us made us accepted in the beloved you can quit your whining and wipe in your snout if the word if that seed was laying in you and the light is shine and quicken that word seed in you brother sister he has already accepted you hallelujah you're not waiting to be accepted he has already accepted you let's read on in whom we have redemption through the blood through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having it made known having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on the earth even in him beautiful in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will the devil can't kill you god's got his own will in place that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ isn't that a beautiful word isn't that a beautiful word i want to i want to ask you a question how did you get here your mama and your daddy came together in a sexual union your mom provided an egg your father provided what the what the greek word is sperma which is life or seed your father provided that and that seed fertilized that egg and an embryo was formed and that child carries dna and and it carries the stamp of both mother and father and we can't hardly wait for it to get here for us to see who it looks like is it gonna have daddy's ears is it gonna have mama's big nose is it gonna have whose disposition is it gonna have and everybody praise mamas please but there's something in you that your mama and your daddy didn't give you sex has never produced a human spirit can't do it no mom and daddy coming together in a physical union has ever produced a human spirit in your heart can't happen it happens for you just like it happened for adam unless god places a spirit in you so there is something about you that mama had nothing to do with and daddy had nothing to do with now i want to ask you how it got there without that spirit coming in without that breath coming in without that life coming in there's no soul somebody said what in the world are you saying exactly what the bible said and god breathed breath on him and man into him into his nostrils and man became what without a spirit without human breath or god breath without life coming in a gift of god then there's no soul created to connect you with both spirit and environment something has to stand between the spirit part of you and the flesh part of you and that's the human soul that creature whatever it was in the garden of eden that looked so much like a man that it that the enemy could press himself that satan could press himself into and use that it was absent of something important it had no soul it was created of god it had life but not god's breath so it had no soul very interesting isn't it now i want you to know that in order for you to have life it has to be given to you by god and it's hideous as miscarriage is as horrible as painful as heart wrenching as it can be god is a sovereign god there is no accident in him you may never know until you stand in the presence of god why that had to happen that way my sympathy my compassion my heart is with you but unless god should give that little baby spirit life then it is a body is that correct now that means that somebody had to make a decision of what went into your physical form as you were forming there in your in your mother's womb and i happen to believe that that part of who you are could have been expressed in any other age and i happen to believe that who you really are was hand-picked by god and placed in your body powerful the bible said god places the solitaire in families you are not born into the wrong family you may feel like the oddball or the odd bird or the black sheep or the stray cat or whatever you feel like but you're you were born into that family for a reason sometime only one chosen for the work of god only one chosen for eternal life and in other situations god raises up one solitaire in a family to be a light to be both encouragement and judgment to a family in that grace it's grace it's sovereignty it's a it's a powerful thing so i want you to know that makes you uh here expressed in this hour given to that little body forming in your mother's womb for a divine purpose and that seed that god gave you he placed that in you that seed is a part of him are you hearing what i'm saying that seed is an expression of his word and it is a part of who he is and what it did we say about the original seed the the spoken word is the original seed so there's a part of you there's a part of you right now there's a part of you here right now that came from the mouth of a living god do you know what that makes you it makes you a seed of god and where did the seed come from in the beginning musicians coming i want you to know why you came you came because you were spoken somebody said what i am what am i what am i what am i you're a word brother branham gives us a definition of a word he said a word is a thought expressed where did the bible say we originated help me now come on now this is what i don't want you to do we're really coming to the end i promise i do i do we're coming to the end but i don't want you to miss this in the end this is what we've been working toward so don't miss this sweet folks precious brothers and sisters don't miss this now i want you to be able to hear this a word is a thought expressed the bible tells us and the message is clear we existed in the mind of god as a thought chosen in him before the foundation of the world so you were first a thought i want you to look at your neighbor and say i was first a thought wasn't your daddy's thought wasn't your mama's thought you were first in the mind of god you were first a thought in the mind of god say it again do you know what you're saying it's a powerful thing to say it i was first a thought in the mind of god well i'm no longer just a thought i found a body god placed that seed that thought in a body i'm there he put me in he put me the real me in a body he chose a little body that was forming in the in the womb of a of a margaret jane shelley because of the contribution of a of a ralph shelley a little body forming there and god chose this is the time he's sovereign he can do it this is a time that stephen lamar shelley is going to be expressed in the earth so this is the body that i've chosen to put him in and he places me there and in that moment when i become a demonstration of god when i become reality and no longer just a thought of god the only way that transference can take place is i'm spoken there anybody with me so in that moment i became more than just the thought of god are you with me i became a word i want you to look at your neighbor and say i i was first a thought of god but i'm expressed i've been born i'm now in the earth tell them tell them tell them i know you feel silly tell them anyway and so now i'm not just a thought i am now a word i am now a word i am now a word you remember how jealous god was yes you remember how jealous god was over his word that he sent the holy ghost to woo over the darkness you remember how jealous he was over the original seed that came from the original creation he's just that jealous over you somebody ought to help me now he's just that jealous over you hallelujah i don't think you believe me [Music] i don't think you believe me i don't think you believe me i don't think you believe me i'm not sure you believe me i need somebody to explain it i need to make sure that you believe me i've got to know that you that you hear me i need something i'm not asking you to preach don't preach we don't need any more preaching i've done more than we need i want you to just in your words tell me what you were in the beginning i'm coming to you brother greeley that's all the warning you get i want you to tell me what you were in the beginning and who you are now i was a thought in the mind of god are you just repeating that because i said it no sir okay i was a thought you were the mind of god in eternity past he thought about you he knew you he knew your mom and dad he knew your siblings he knew where they would live he knew the church your dad would pastor he knew the wife you would marry he knew the two children you would have he knew the grand babies that would follow you were all of that all of that was in his mind yes and because of i was a thought in his mind the lamb was slain from before the foundation of the world for you for me that's it so that i could become a word sent from god sent from god power manifested in the earth powerful and and and what was it making that that holy ghost brood over the water like that why did that take place what was going on there because there was seed seed in the water where'd that seed start from the mind of god then it became the word then it was spoken to spoken into the earth and even though lucifer had that great rebellion and a synonym and god plunged the earth into darkness and chaos and water it didn't change the fact that was still his word it was still his word was still laying under the water right yes so the holy spirit was brooding now all your life that's what was happening to you every party if you went to any parties i don't know your personal testimony very few you went to parties very few very few he was raised in a preacher's family and had his own conversion but every party you went to every every every shot you took that kind that kind too never took he was with you he saw it all he knew it all yeah knew all of still loved you he sure did couldn't divorce you couldn't couldn't cast you off couldn't get rid of you because you originated in his mind hallelujah all right you became word do you want to add anything are you the only one is brother greedy the only one in here that understands what i'm preaching this morning uh austin can you can you repeat any of that i mean do you understand any of that all right tell us tell us i'll help you i know that before the foundation of the world my name was in the lamb's book of life it was it was brother it was how did it get there by his thoughts he thought you first and he wrote it down yes sir that's right that's all that matters that's all that matters to me too lord okay you started out as a thought that was way way back in eternity past these four generate before genesis 1 1 before genesis 1 1 that's exactly right and then and then how many years ago has it been since you were born 27 27 years ago god expressed you as as always has thought but he expressed you into the earth yes sir placed who you really are in that little body that was forming in your mother's belly is that right i already knew that he already knew you already knew all right so that makes you no longer just a thought of god you're now expressed and a thought expressed this word a word yes so i want to hear you say i am a word sinful i am a word sent from god sent from god say it again i am a word sent from god let's praise god [Applause] what's that's this that's it but you can't steal the punchline do you see how hard i have worked up here and you're gonna take my punchline my underwear is wet and she is going to steal the punchline i'm kidding i'm totally kidding i'm kidding i'm sorry i made you red why do you think i brought my notes down here so i could read this verse of scripture she's right on right on that's revelation that's revelation and it's uh it's all in order it's all in order i want to read you two verses one that sister joyce is quoting to us uh i want to read matthew 24 35 there won't be any church tonight heaven and earth shall pass away but my words what did you say who did you say you were i am a word you are a word sent from god you will not pass away you will not become void you will not be plunged into chaos or destruction or annihilation you will not cease to exist because here's a promise in isaiah 55 11 and we're closing so shall my w glory hallelujah lord i want to serve you lord i want to glorify your name i want to reflect who i was created to be i don't want there to be any backsliding in my life i want to stand and be all that you created me to be and purpose me to be so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth let's stop a moment what was laying underneath that water the word seed from the word that had gone forth from his mouth how did it become a word it was once a thought when that thought became expressed then it became a word god spoke that word into the original creation and even though lucifer had rebelled and a great gap took place in the verses and everything was covered beneath the water and it's just laying there the great dove the precious dove is cooing calling to the seed guarding and protecting the seed with cocaine in your nose you could have left this earth with venereal disease in your body you could have left this earth there are testimonies in this room sleeping with so many you couldn't keep up with their names you could have left this earth strung out out of your mind you could have left this earth but god but god but god you weren't pleasing him you weren't pleasing him but you were still his thought you were pleasing him but you were still the expression of his word even living a dirty no good rotten sorry sinful life you still belong to him and he'd already given you a prefix destiny you were just living it just walking it out because redemption was coming i want you to know redemption was coming how many of you have come to find out redemption was coming your way hallelujah and if god would not let one seed here's the point if god would not let one seed be wasted one word of his mouth not wasted but the holy spirit wooing over all of it god guarding all that if god did that over the seat of an apple tree or a blade of grass or an azalea bush how much more has the holy ghost guarded your life and wooed over you and and protected you and cooed to you and called to you and even made love over your life when you thought it was ruins and no good and nothing good will ever come out of me and all that stuff let's finish it so shall my word be that goethe forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall oh my god here we talk shall not pass away jesus said now the prophet isaiah said it shall not return unto me void i didn't speak it to be void i didn't speak it to be dark i didn't speak it to be chaotic i spoke it to be complete and perfect but something changed a little bit something shifted a little bit and the earth went into darkness you didn't come here to be a sinner you didn't come here to live the life you lived you didn't come here to do the things you've done no no you didn't come here for that purpose but god allowed it oh yes but he didn't let you go out there by yourself [Music] amen you may not believe this kind of preaching but he sat with you on the bar stool somebody said i don't believe jesus to go nowhere like that i'm thank god that he does i thank god that he does he stood there in the waiting room of the abortion clinic he followed you he watched over you you're driving drunk out of your mind you could have easily gone out of this world some of you had to pay a price for your sin some of you had some hardship and some twisting and some broken bones and and you had to learn some lessons but oh how he watched over you in sin how he protected you even in sin how he wouldn't let you go too far even in sin because you were his thought you were his word and this is how he feels he's jealous about his word so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish oh somebody say i will accomplish what he pleases and i shall prosper where he sends me that's it somebody said are you calling me the holy bible no i'm calling you the word of god [Music] the holy bible is just the written record of his word but that's not all he said he said florine hendrix he said april he said jennifer he said bethany he said to megan he said them all he didn't just say the bible that we read and say no more he said a william branham come on you just go right through this room he said you you're here because he expressed you so shall my word be that goethe forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void it will accomplish it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereunto i send it i want you to give god praise come on stand up [Applause] stand up and stretch [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] has the devil ever told you you missed your chance has the devil ever told you you forfeited your destiny has the devil ever told you because of the mess you made you'll never get another chance to be what god called you to be the devil's a liar he's a liar he's the father of all eyes you are a word sent from god you are a word sinned from god and you will not return to god void you will accomplish that which the father hath sent you forth to accomplish how can you say that brother shelly you have that much confidence in us that you can say that no i don't want to hurt your feelings i have that much
