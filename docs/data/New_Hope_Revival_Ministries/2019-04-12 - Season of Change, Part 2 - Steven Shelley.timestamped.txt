[0:45] [Music]
[0:59] hello there I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of
[1:02] New Hope revival ministries in Smith
[1:04] Station Alabama we're coming to you
[1:07] today again in partnership with the
[1:10] great folks at the gospel channel and I
[1:13] know that you're familiar with the
[1:15] Ministry of the gospel Channel and I
[1:17] know that many of you appreciate the
[1:19] programming that's available to you on
[1:22] this network and I am delighted to have
[1:24] a part I'm so thankful for the
[1:27] opportunity that the Lord has given us
[1:29] we have been in relationship with these
[1:32] folks for a long time and we're just
[1:35] thankful to stand with them I believe
[1:37] that God has some great things in store
[1:40] for us in the near future and I'd like
[1:43] to invite you to always pray for the
[1:47] gospel channel and you can pray for new
[1:49] hope revival ministries too we also
[1:52] desire your prayer but we're here to
[1:55] serve you and we would like to stand
[1:58] with you in faith believing God for your
[2:01] request and there are numerous ways that
[2:04] you can contact us with those requests
[2:06] there is a prayer line number that will
[2:09] be given to you you can email us also
[2:11] and if you miss a program and you would
[2:16] like to go back and fill in the gap a
[2:18] bit because sometimes we do series here
[2:22] on this program you can find us on
[2:25] YouTube and you can look for the
[2:28] particular episode number and we have
[2:31] some other material that I believe would
[2:34] be a great blessing to you own our
[2:36] YouTube channel you can even subscribe
[2:38] and be notified when new content is
[2:42] added we also have a new and exciting
[2:45] ministry app that you can download on
[2:48] your phone or your tablet and even your
[2:52] Smart TV if you have a Roku or Apple TV
[2:56] and you can watch all of the programming
[2:59] as well as listen to sermon recording
[3:03] some of them 50 and 60 years old but
[3:07] very very relevant for where we are
[3:10] living today I know that you'll be
[3:12] blessed by the app you can also find us
[3:15] on Facebook and Instagram and some of
[3:20] the other social media outlets just
[3:22] because we want to be there for you when
[3:25] you need us and we appreciate all of the
[3:29] kind words and comments that you have
[3:32] have given to us telling us that the
[3:35] program has blessed you that really is
[3:39] what we want to hear and we have tried
[3:43] to be faithful in praying with you over
[3:45] your prayer requests and we are always
[3:47] excited when we hear that the Lord has
[3:50] heard an answered prayer so it's an
[3:53] exciting time to serve the Lord there's
[3:56] no doubt about it there's a lot of
[3:58] things going on around us that look
[4:00] bleak and look dark but I just always
[4:03] say that when it's getting darker out
[4:05] there it has to get brighter in here and
[4:07] I believe that God wants us to be filled
[4:11] with the light the love of the Holy
[4:14] Spirit and I believe that He desires to
[4:17] draw us if we're willing to yield
[4:20] ourselves to him into a closer and even
[4:24] more intimate relationship with him this
[4:28] is not about religion this is about
[4:31] relationship when we were together the
[4:34] last time it seemed that the Lord just
[4:37] directed us in a different direction and
[4:39] we began to minister and pray lead folk
[4:44] in the prayer of repentance and
[4:46] salvation and we prayed for Christian
[4:49] believers to be encouraged and lifted up
[4:52] and also for healing and I believe that
[4:55] many of you who saw that program you
[4:58] joined your faith with ours and God has
[5:01] been faithful to meet your needs at the
[5:04] end of that program we started talking
[5:07] about a subject that I had wanted to
[5:09] share with you and I get the opportunity
[5:12] of doing that today and I guess I would
[5:15] just call the program see
[5:18] of change there's one thing for sure
[5:21] change is inevitable it just seems that
[5:25] nothing ever stays exactly the same
[5:28] except the Lord Jesus Christ because the
[5:32] Bible tells us in Hebrews 13 and 8 Jesus
[5:35] Christ the same yesterday and today and
[5:39] forever in other words he does not
[5:43] change
[5:44] he is constant he is steady he is
[5:47] faithful but our lives change and this
[5:52] is not always a bad thing I know that
[5:55] most of us are not comfortable with
[5:58] change once we get things kind of going
[6:01] along coasting like we like them the
[6:04] last thing we want to do is welcome a
[6:06] change in our life but on the other hand
[6:10] there are things in our life that we
[6:12] don't want to stay the same and so we
[6:15] have to learn to be able to discern the
[6:18] times and the seasons we need to
[6:22] understand how that God opens up a door
[6:25] at times he closes that door but another
[6:30] door is open and it's hard not to get
[6:33] disappointed when things that we have
[6:35] enjoyed change but I just want to
[6:38] encourage you by letting you know that
[6:40] when God closes a door sometimes we hear
[6:44] the expression when God closes a window
[6:46] he opens the door it doesn't matter to
[6:49] me what analogy we use the truth remains
[6:52] the same if God is closing a chapter
[6:56] something particularly in your life it
[6:59] is because he has something new
[7:01] something fresh for you and when I say
[7:05] that we know what the scripture said
[7:07] there is nothing new Under the Sun but
[7:10] what I mean is to be able to know when
[7:13] the Spirit of God is desiring to move in
[7:17] your life and perhaps through your life
[7:19] in a different way than he did in the
[7:22] last season I'd like for us to look at
[7:26] the scripture because cease
[7:28] and times of the Lord the times and the
[7:32] seasons of the Lord it's a very biblical
[7:35] concept and it's first introduced to us
[7:39] actually in the first chapter of the
[7:41] Bible Genesis chapter 1 and I would like
[7:44] to read verses 11 through 14 and God
[7:48] said let the earth bring forth grass the
[7:52] herb yielding seed and the fruit tree
[7:55] yielding fruit after his kind whose seed
[7:59] is in itself upon the earth and it was
[8:04] so and the earth brought forth grass and
[8:07] herb yielding seed after his kind and
[8:10] the tree yielding fruit whose seed was
[8:14] in itself after his kind and God saw
[8:18] that it was good God said let it be and
[8:22] it was according to how God had spoken
[8:26] it and now God blesses it and seals it
[8:29] by saying it was good and in verse 13
[8:34] and the evening and the morning were the
[8:37] third day verse 14 and God said Let
[8:41] there be lights in the firmament of the
[8:44] heavens to divide the day from the night
[8:48] here is God he has spoken light in into
[8:53] existence he has called the light out
[8:56] from the mixture and now he is setting
[9:01] something in the heavens to divide the
[9:04] light and he says let there be lights in
[9:08] the firmament of the heavens to divide
[9:10] the day from the night and let them be
[9:13] for signs and for seasons and for days
[9:17] and years so right here at the beginning
[9:21] of creation
[9:23] God could have ordained that it would be
[9:27] daylight and never be night he could
[9:31] have ordained that it would always be
[9:33] dark and that it would never be bright
[9:36] but instead he spoke light into
[9:41] existence
[9:42] calling it out of the darkness which we
[9:45] find in Hebrew is a mixture of the light
[9:48] in the darkness so God from the
[9:51] beginning of the creation see God is
[9:53] light and what God was doing is he was
[9:56] calling by his spoken word the light to
[10:00] come out of the mixture out of the
[10:03] darkness and to come forward to be what
[10:06] God had spoken it to be and then he
[10:09] created the Sun in the moon - to govern
[10:14] the Sun to govern the day the moon to
[10:17] govern the night and he designed the
[10:21] world and the Sun and the moon and the
[10:25] stars in such a way that the day would
[10:29] be divided it would be part day it would
[10:32] be part night and he used these created
[10:36] elements of light the Sun and the moon
[10:39] to set in order to establish an order of
[10:46] signs and seasons God said the Sun and
[10:50] the moon will be signs and they will be
[10:53] Testaments of seasons you will see the
[10:57] Sun in the day you will know it is day
[11:00] you will see the moon in the night you
[11:02] will know it is night and these elements
[11:05] that God created serve greater purposes
[11:08] to help us understand of course we know
[11:12] if we study there is that gravitational
[11:14] pull that the moon helps control the
[11:16] tides and you know God has just done it
[11:20] right I'm just amazed when I read about
[11:24] a creation when I read about plant life
[11:28] and animal life and and and how God
[11:30] creates in certain plants everything
[11:35] they need in animals everything they
[11:38] need to function as they were created to
[11:41] function at giving them camouflage to
[11:44] protect themselves from predators and I
[11:46] just tell you it's it's a great big
[11:48] wonderful world that God has created and
[11:53] seasons times and seasons and the
[11:56] evening and the morning were the first
[11:58] day
[11:59] so how do we know a day is past because
[12:02] there has been an evening there has been
[12:04] a morning now we know and so God
[12:06] designed it this way and then as we were
[12:10] ending the program we read quickly a
[12:13] portion of Ecclesiastes chapter 3 and
[12:18] and I'd like to just take time to read
[12:20] the eighth verses that we had set aside
[12:22] to read for everything there is a season
[12:26] this is Ecclesiastes 3:1 for everything
[12:30] there is a season and a time for every
[12:33] purpose under heaven
[12:35] a time to be born and the time to die a
[12:38] time to plant and a time to pluck up
[12:41] that which is planted a time to kill and
[12:43] a time to heal a time to break down and
[12:46] a time to build up a time to weep and a
[12:50] time to laugh a time to mourn and a time
[12:53] to dance a time to cast away stones and
[12:56] a time to gather stones together a time
[13:00] to embrace and a time to refrain from
[13:03] embracing a time to seek and a time to
[13:06] lose a time to keep and a time to cast
[13:09] away a time to tear and a time to sew a
[13:14] time to keep silence and a time to speak
[13:17] a time to love and a time to hate a time
[13:21] for war and a time for peace to
[13:25] everything God has given a time a
[13:28] purpose a season it's not easy because
[13:33] if I were to go down this list I would I
[13:36] would pick I would pick the good side I
[13:39] would pick the time to dance over the
[13:42] time to mourn I would pick the time to
[13:45] laugh over the time to weep maybe the
[13:49] time to build up over the time to break
[13:51] down but God was establishing in his
[13:54] word that in his mind and in his will
[13:58] everything has a season everything has a
[14:03] time for every purpose
[14:06] under heaven I believe that our lives
[14:10] can be so much smoother really and more
[14:16] peaceful it doesn't mean that we won't
[14:18] have controversy or or situations that
[14:24] disturb our peace but I believe that our
[14:27] life will be so much sweeter if we can
[14:31] learn what is this season am I to be
[14:36] weeping in this season or am I to be
[14:38] laughing am I to be mourning in this
[14:41] season or am I to be dancing and you say
[14:44] well that just seems very complicated to
[14:47] me well I just I just believe that it is
[14:51] possible for the bride of Jesus Christ
[14:55] to discern to know to recognize the the
[15:01] moment the time the season that God has
[15:05] us in right now and what is important in
[15:08] this season there may be some things
[15:11] that were important in the last
[15:14] spiritual season emphasized in fact that
[15:18] are not being emphasized as much in this
[15:21] season if they were true then they are
[15:24] true now and we must not compromise on
[15:27] truth but it seems that the Spirit of
[15:32] God will come to the body of Christ and
[15:36] give themes you know for a season you
[15:42] can hear three or four different
[15:44] ministers and they're ministering the
[15:47] same thing and you wonder my this is
[15:50] this is wonderful the next time you
[15:52] encounter those ministries again they're
[15:55] ministering similar things using their
[15:58] individual giftings their unique
[16:01] vocabularies and styles but ministering
[16:05] along the same thing but it's entirely
[16:07] different than the theme that they were
[16:10] ministering on the last time you were in
[16:13] their services some body is discerning
[16:16] the ebb and the flow
[16:20] of God seasons and gods times does that
[16:24] make any sense to you at all I hope it
[16:26] does
[16:27] because I believe it's time for change I
[16:32] believe that there are things that you
[16:35] and I have authority to speak change
[16:38] into I believe there are moments of
[16:43] acceleration where God wants to speed up
[16:47] what is happening in the realm of the
[16:51] Spirit and you and I want to be well we
[16:54] want to be cooperative we want to be
[16:57] actively participating in what God
[17:01] desires to do any sung worship leader or
[17:06] service leader really wants to be able
[17:11] to tap in to what God is trying to
[17:15] accomplish in the atmosphere of any
[17:18] particular service sometimes we're just
[17:21] paralyzed because we know that God
[17:24] desires to do something different in a
[17:27] service because no service is just alike
[17:30] and yet we feel a bit paralyzed because
[17:32] we're we're trying to tap in we're
[17:36] trying to be able to discern what is it
[17:40] it is it is it healing that's the Lord
[17:43] want us to at that very moment even
[17:46] though the offering hasn't been taken
[17:48] even though the sermon hasn't come yet
[17:50] is it that God wants us to in that
[17:53] moment call for the elders of the church
[17:55] let them anoint with all and lay hands
[17:58] on the sick is it that we should sing
[18:01] one more song of worship and praise what
[18:06] is the what is the altar service to look
[18:08] like is it to always be an altar call to
[18:12] sinners are there times that God wants
[18:15] to to encourage the Saints are there
[18:19] times that the emphasis at the end of
[18:21] the service should be on healing what
[18:24] does the Lord want to do in any given
[18:26] service and this is the struggle that
[18:29] that leadership often has
[18:32] when we're trying to conduct a service
[18:34] because I tell you we can't afford to
[18:37] waste a service the body of Christ needs
[18:41] the strength that we get when we gather
[18:44] in the corporate anointing and sometimes
[18:48] the theme of a of a song service is on
[18:51] the coming of the Lord
[18:52] and it's that is that what God would
[18:55] have us focus on right this moment our
[18:58] sometimes the song worship seems to
[19:02] focus on what what is happening in the
[19:04] heavenlies at that moment worship around
[19:08] the throne and discovering you know it's
[19:12] not just picking up a list of songs and
[19:15] and eeny meeny miny moe I'll sing this
[19:19] now and because we're trying to develop
[19:22] an atmosphere for the truth of God's
[19:25] Word to go forth and not only be
[19:28] preached with power but with some
[19:30] demonstration lives to be changed and so
[19:35] I just want to encourage you that I
[19:39] believe that the Lord would have me to
[19:42] speak to you and say to you announce to
[19:47] you that it's time for change I believe
[19:52] that in our local assembly in our local
[19:56] church God has declared to us by the
[19:59] Holy Spirit you are in a new season and
[20:03] then it becomes our responsibility what
[20:07] is this new season and and what should
[20:10] we be preaching what should we be
[20:13] working toward and you know even even
[20:16] there are strongholds and principalities
[20:20] and things that that need to be dealt
[20:23] with bondage that needs to be broken off
[20:27] of people's lives and I believe that
[20:29] even sometimes that is seasonal so to
[20:33] speak the Lord may come and and he may
[20:38] move in a certain way that he wants to
[20:41] help us deal with our thoughts and then
[20:44] he make
[20:45] and and inspire us to deal with our
[20:48] words so it's it's it's a tightrope
[20:53] really it's a sensitive walk we don't
[20:58] want to to assume we want to be led by
[21:03] the Spirit of God for as many as are led
[21:06] by the Spirit of God they are we are the
[21:09] sons of God so it's always been a part
[21:14] of God's order for time and season to be
[21:19] measured before there were computers and
[21:22] iPads and cell phones and watches and
[21:25] even paper and pen existed
[21:27] God gave us something to help us track
[21:30] to keep track of where we are concerning
[21:34] time here were the day and the night and
[21:38] eventually then the calendar developed
[21:40] and we know what month it is
[21:41] and we know what day of the week it is
[21:44] etc because if you don't know where you
[21:48] are you'll never be able to determine
[21:51] where you are going and so this is one
[21:54] of the things I want us to commit to
[21:56] prayer where are we now God says I'm
[22:00] ready to lead you into a season of
[22:02] change where are we now what what
[22:06] excites us in this season what what are
[22:09] we disappointed in in ourselves what
[22:12] would we like to see change what would
[22:15] we like to do different you know I find
[22:18] out when I'm in this place of
[22:20] contemplation I write down I I do I have
[22:25] I have picked up the old-fashioned way I
[22:28] like to I'm not a good typist but I I
[22:30] can manage
[22:32] I can use my thumbs like like the young
[22:34] generation can I do pretty good with
[22:36] that but what I'm really in a moment of
[22:40] contemplation really meditating and
[22:44] thinking I find that I write I just
[22:47] write it down old-fashioned paper and
[22:50] pen and I just write down the thoughts
[22:52] that come to my mind I sometimes write
[22:55] down things that I want to
[22:57] I want to do differently in my life I
[23:00] write down things that I want to say
[23:02] differently words I want to stay away
[23:05] from and I don't mean you know curse
[23:08] words but but you know just negative
[23:12] death talk and I write words that I want
[23:15] to replace some of those negative words
[23:18] with and so when you're in a season of
[23:21] discovery when you're trying to discern
[23:23] by the spirit where am I where am I
[23:27] going in this time of change it's very
[23:31] helpful to think on some of these things
[23:34] and maybe even write them down because
[23:36] if we can discern the season of the Lord
[23:39] we can know what to do and when to do it
[23:44] and I think that is very important
[23:46] because sometimes we know what we want
[23:49] to do what we should do but we don't
[23:52] know when to make the move to make the
[23:55] step of faith or the leap of faith
[23:57] without seasons we become frustrated
[24:01] because we find ourselves doing things
[24:04] in the wrong time and in the wrong
[24:07] season doing things at the right time
[24:11] doing the right things at the right time
[24:15] is crucial therefore the seasons of the
[24:19] Lord are vitally important now we don't
[24:23] know in the beginning of a season we
[24:27] don't always know the duration how long
[24:29] that's going to last I mean we're living
[24:33] in such an hour now that that sometimes
[24:36] we can see God doing things in rapid
[24:39] succession just one right after another
[24:41] and then then you step into that slow
[24:44] season where everything is dry you're
[24:49] just pressing with everything you've
[24:50] gotten barely getting through and then
[24:52] all of a sudden the Lord begins to lead
[24:54] you and reveal himself to you in fresh
[24:56] ways and you're running again we have to
[25:00] learn not to be discouraged when we are
[25:04] in the pressing season because as I told
[25:08] the church recently you know
[25:10] doesn't matter if you are running like
[25:12] the hair or creeping like the tortoise
[25:14] what matters is that you keep moving and
[25:18] that you are creeping in a season where
[25:22] God wants you moving slow and you are
[25:25] sprinting in the season that God wants
[25:28] you to accelerate so in other words the
[25:31] most important thing is learning to
[25:33] discover the life of Enoch who walked
[25:37] with God and was not for God took him
[25:41] when we look at that story of the life
[25:45] of Enoch we find that there was an
[25:47] emptying of Enoch Enoch was not it means
[25:52] he was physically called away but when
[25:56] we look at that expression in the Hebrew
[25:58] its its dual and it is also saying to us
[26:03] Enoch was not Enoch emptied himself of
[26:09] all selfish ambition Enoch emptied
[26:13] himself of his own will o mine his own
[26:19] will I'm telling you we all have a will
[26:22] and it's a good thing because that will
[26:26] that free will is what helped us to
[26:30] establish our relationship with the Lord
[26:32] he knew us by foreknowledge but he
[26:36] allowed us to make that choice of our
[26:38] will the truth is he knew our act of
[26:43] free will he knew our choice before we
[26:46] ever made it because he is an
[26:48] all-knowing God but he gave us the gift
[26:51] of will and that gift of a will self
[26:56] will is beautiful when it's sanctified
[27:00] when we're using it for the purposes of
[27:03] God but when that self will become
[27:06] stubborn will oh my does the Christian
[27:10] life ever get bumpy then can somebody
[27:13] say Amen it really gets rough when we
[27:18] exercise our stubborn will and so we
[27:23] have
[27:23] learn to sanctify that wheel and we have
[27:26] to learn to yield and I've never I've
[27:30] never learned how to explain to someone
[27:34] how to yield it's it's just not it's
[27:39] just not possible for me to explain to
[27:42] someone how to yield but I can tell you
[27:44] this you've got to give up now that
[27:47] that's easy to say but it's not always
[27:50] easy to do you're coming you and I are
[27:54] coming to a place as believers that we
[27:58] must lay down our wheel and say not my
[28:01] will even if it's a good thing even if
[28:05] it's a good will a good plan you're
[28:07] choosing for yourself we have to be
[28:09] willing to lay it at the feet of Jesus
[28:11] and say Lord I want to have a
[28:13] surrendered life hallelujah I want to
[28:16] live a laydown life that I might please
[28:21] you so we discover that doing things at
[28:25] the right time in the right season with
[28:29] the right spirit is crucial and
[28:32] therefore we we mark the spiritual
[28:35] seasons in in in the Jewish faith in the
[28:40] Hebrew perspective they look at every
[28:43] month on the Hebrew calendar very very
[28:46] carefully and they they mark things that
[28:53] are connected to that month for instance
[28:56] a color a tribe one of the tribes of
[29:00] Israel is connected even a part of the
[29:05] body is connected with that month and I
[29:08] know that there is a possibility of
[29:10] going too far on those ideas and moving
[29:14] in something that is more like
[29:15] witchcraft but I also understand that
[29:19] God is the one who told the children of
[29:21] Israel to mark the new moon and why are
[29:24] they marking the new moon because they
[29:27] are to mark the new month the new month
[29:31] and they are to mark that and they are
[29:34] to celebrate it with firstfruits
[29:36] and they are to know when they know when
[29:38] an old month has ended and a new month
[29:41] has began so this is a biblical concept
[29:45] to watch where we are to make sure that
[29:49] we are not just spinning our wheels
[29:52] because we are doing something good or
[29:55] doing something right but not in the
[29:57] season where there is grace and
[30:00] anointing to do that particular you know
[30:05] we have been we have been doing
[30:07] television programs now for quite a few
[30:09] years and let's see 1566 like like 14
[30:16] years and maybe a little bit longer but
[30:20] we're we're in a season now where there
[30:23] is some grace to do it and we're seeing
[30:27] some results and I don't mind plowing
[30:30] you know I've been serving the Lord a
[30:33] long time and I've been plowing a long
[30:34] time but it sure is easier to keep
[30:37] plowing when you begin to see some
[30:39] harvest when you begin to see some fruit
[30:42] of your labor and you who are on the
[30:44] other end of this program you who are
[30:46] watching this program by your reaching
[30:49] out and sharing your request with us and
[30:52] telling us when God has answered prayer
[30:55] and letting us know that the broadcast
[30:57] is a blessing to you you are playing a
[30:59] part of encouraging us to keep pressing
[31:03] but you know and there was a season in
[31:06] there where we could just hardly do we
[31:08] didn't have the equipment that we needed
[31:10] and we could just hardly get it done and
[31:13] I'm not telling you that it's easy you
[31:16] know just because God's calling us to do
[31:19] something doesn't make it automatically
[31:20] easy but I believe that we're in the
[31:23] season and that's why I want to believe
[31:26] with all my heart that the gospel
[31:28] channel's outreach will expand I want to
[31:31] believe that before this thing is over
[31:34] that God will bless that little nation
[31:37] of Iceland and how they're reaching out
[31:39] across the world until every nation is
[31:42] being touched by the ministry that God
[31:44] has raised up in that tiny little place
[31:47] and thanks be to God we get
[31:49] have a part in that and it appears that
[31:51] we're moving in to a season where we're
[31:55] going to see some increase and some
[31:57] expansion but if it's not yet time for
[32:00] it then what do we do we got to keep
[32:02] plowing we've got to keep sowing the
[32:04] seed and we must be faithful if I could
[32:07] give you a piece of advice that I think
[32:11] would would really be the most important
[32:14] thing I could say to you as a believer I
[32:16] would say be faithful be consistent and
[32:19] be faithful because God is faithful he
[32:23] who promised this it's faithful to bring
[32:26] it to pass but we do have a
[32:29] responsibility to to not drag behind the
[32:33] purposes of God and we have a
[32:36] responsibility not to run ahead of the
[32:39] purposes of God but to walk it's a daily
[32:42] walk Lord what would you have me to do
[32:45] now what what is it that you desire who
[32:48] is it that you want me to touch who am i
[32:50] reaching out for today what what would
[32:53] you have us to do and you know God has
[32:56] blessed the little ministry in Alabama
[32:59] in such a beautiful way and I remember
[33:02] years ago and I mentioned this to you
[33:04] when when God began to speak to us about
[33:07] a telephone hook-up and and we had
[33:09] different families that were without
[33:11] churches and needed fellowship who who
[33:14] would call the church on the Sunday
[33:16] morning and we would flip a switch and
[33:19] they would be able to hear the audio of
[33:21] the service on their telephone and
[33:23] sometimes on a speakerphone if they had
[33:25] it and now we stream over the internet
[33:28] and God gave us the website and and and
[33:33] he really really used the website
[33:36] he sent the right one the right brother
[33:40] in two to create that website and to
[33:43] develop it in such a way that it would
[33:46] be able to reach out and accomplish what
[33:48] it's accomplishing today there was a
[33:50] season where that was the main and now
[33:53] we've come to an app on your phone a few
[33:58] years ago if you would have mentioned
[34:00] such a thing to me
[34:01] yes that I would have said we can't
[34:03] afford that we don't know how to do that
[34:05] we'll never be able to run something
[34:07] like that but but God opened the door he
[34:11] gave gave the inspiration he provided
[34:15] the finance to do it and it has been
[34:19] hard work our staff works tirelessly I'm
[34:23] telling you they they work so hard but
[34:27] it's the season and I love it because
[34:31] they're open Lord what is the next what
[34:36] would you lead us to next and you say
[34:39] well you're talking about a ministry yes
[34:41] I know I am but in your life in your
[34:46] life you know I know that there are
[34:49] times that God leads us to a particular
[34:51] Bible study group and have you ever been
[34:54] in something like that you just loved it
[34:56] and everything was going good and all of
[34:58] a sudden you could harder to make
[35:00] yourself go anymore it just changed and
[35:02] and you know you've got to be you've got
[35:05] to be the one who who seeks that out in
[35:07] prayer is this the enemy it's this the
[35:10] devil trying to keep me from from from
[35:12] this Bible study or is this the Lord
[35:15] taking some of the joy out of it and the
[35:17] desire out of it because he wants to
[35:20] separate me from that and move me in
[35:22] another direction oh brother
[35:26] Shelly you're just complicating all this
[35:28] well it may sound complicated in trying
[35:32] to explain it or express it to you but
[35:35] it's really just the daily surrender
[35:37] you're just surrendering daily Lord I
[35:40] lay my life down before you I desire
[35:43] that you pick it up and use me for your
[35:46] glory what would you have me to do today
[35:48] what would you have me to say today
[35:50] where would you have me to be now
[35:52] keeping in mind we have responsibilities
[35:55] and we have job job responsibilities and
[35:58] family responsibilities and I understand
[36:00] that but no matter how busy you are with
[36:04] life you must not be so busy that you
[36:07] don't have time to seek direction and
[36:11] instruction from the one that has called
[36:13] you
[36:14] you were born to serve the Lord born to
[36:18] serve the Lord
[36:19] I just realized and I know I do it all
[36:21] the time but I happened to glance up in
[36:23] the monitor and I'm just using my hands
[36:25] and and I hope I don't I mean I could
[36:28] tuck them under here but but it just
[36:30] helps me some time to be able to express
[36:32] myself that way so I hope it's not too
[36:35] distracting if it is you might have to
[36:37] close your eyes and listen but we're
[36:40] just here to to bless you we're just
[36:43] here because we want to encourage you
[36:45] that there is more than just a couple
[36:49] times a week sitting through a service
[36:51] if if you're not serving the Lord every
[36:54] day if you're not if you're not making
[36:56] connection with headquarters every day
[36:59] touching the heart of God every day your
[37:02] your going to find it ever increasingly
[37:06] difficult to keep the faith to keep the
[37:11] joy in the journey but if you will make
[37:15] up your mind I'm going to touch home
[37:17] today I'm gonna reach up to the one who
[37:19] called me today I'm gonna pour my love
[37:22] out on the one who has redeemed me today
[37:26] and you make that a discipline and you
[37:29] make it a priority in fact but you do it
[37:32] because you love God and you want to
[37:35] connect with this spirit if you'll do
[37:37] that you will find the daily grace you
[37:41] will find the daily strength that you
[37:43] need to journey on toward the kingdom of
[37:45] God I believe that with all my heart I
[37:47] truly do now as we said a moment ago God
[37:51] could have caused the Sun to shine all
[37:53] the time and the seasons to never change
[37:55] but if he did that he would never we
[37:58] would never know many things if he had
[38:02] not put the Sun and the moon in the
[38:05] heavens and divided the day we would
[38:07] know when to rest we would know when to
[38:09] plant we would know when to harvest what
[38:11] we had planted it took the dividing of
[38:15] the time of the day and the markers so
[38:19] he created seasons and we are crying out
[38:23] for the anointing that was on the sons
[38:25] of Issachar you know the Bible gives us
[38:28] this in first chronicles chapter 12 and
[38:31] verse 32 and of the children of Issachar
[38:35] which were men that had understanding of
[38:39] the times to know what Israel ought to
[38:43] do the heads of them were two hundred
[38:45] and all their brethren were at their
[38:47] commandment God was speaking to us about
[38:49] the children of Issachar having an
[38:51] understanding of the times to know what
[38:54] Israel ought to do I believe that his
[38:57] Holy Ghost filled believers we can know
[38:59] what God would have us to do and if we
[39:02] don't know sometimes we just have to
[39:04] stand still and do nothing until we get
[39:09] instruction the Bible talks about our
[39:12] Lord Jesus not doing anything unless he
[39:16] saw the father doing it not saying
[39:19] anything we could say unless he heard
[39:21] the father saying it that is a
[39:23] surrendered life that is a ministry
[39:26] model that every one of us even in our
[39:29] in our daily life ministry because
[39:33] remember it's not just in the pulpit or
[39:35] with a microphone in our hand every Holy
[39:38] Ghost filled believer is is called to
[39:42] ministry because ministry is about
[39:45] serving and it's about giving and like
[39:48] the like the like Peter and in the in
[39:52] the book of Acts forgive me just a
[39:54] moment I got a little tongue-tied here
[39:56] is the man sitting at the beautiful gate
[39:58] and he's reaching out for alms and he
[40:01] wants something and they said silver and
[40:03] gold have I none but such as I have give
[40:07] IV in the name of Jesus Christ of
[40:10] Nazareth rise up and walk and God gives
[40:14] us he plants in us he puts in us he
[40:19] gives us sometimes what we need and
[40:22] we're carrying that and then we
[40:24] encounter somebody who needs who has a
[40:28] need and you're reaching in to what God
[40:31] has given you and giving it to someone
[40:33] else whether it's a word of
[40:34] encouragement or a song of inspiration
[40:37] or a particular scripture that
[40:40] God has used to speak to you a sermon
[40:42] you heard or something you read and you
[40:45] you encounter someone and you think mine
[40:48] need to share that and you do that's
[40:50] ministry that's ministry or you take
[40:53] somebody by the hand and say hey let me
[40:55] pray for you about that let's agree
[40:57] right now together that is ministry you
[41:01] don't have to have a mailing list or a
[41:03] website to have a ministry God is
[41:07] calling us to that I think we could say
[41:10] that change is always on the way and
[41:12] that is because God is not satisfied
[41:16] leaving us the way he found us it is a
[41:20] process
[41:21] he is always moving changing molding
[41:26] shaping us like clay on the potter's
[41:29] wheel in fact very little stays the same
[41:32] in life we talked about that a moment
[41:35] ago Jesus is the most steady and
[41:37] constant and faithful thing in all of
[41:40] our lives and so sometimes we we don't
[41:44] like change sometimes it's not our
[41:48] favorite thing but it it is not
[41:52] necessary excuse me it is not
[41:55] necessarily change that we don't like in
[41:58] fact some of us often cry out to God for
[42:02] change but often it's the dread and the
[42:06] fear of the unknown sometimes the reason
[42:09] why we resist change it's because we're
[42:13] afraid of what we don't know we know
[42:16] what we know but we're afraid of what we
[42:19] don't know and the fear of the unknown
[42:21] will sometimes cause us to resist change
[42:25] leaving behind the familiar can be very
[42:29] stressful in our lives and that's why we
[42:32] want to make sure that as we walk on
[42:34] we're we're holding on we've got we are
[42:38] hand in hand with the one who loved us
[42:40] the most who saved us and redeemed us
[42:43] from a life of sin we sing the old hymn
[42:46] hand in
[42:47] and with Jesus that may sound
[42:50] old-fashioned to some of you but I'm
[42:52] telling you it's the only way to life
[42:54] it's the only way to journey on is to go
[42:57] hand in hand I feel like I just need to
[43:00] tell somebody change is coming whether
[43:03] you want it or not it's coming change is
[43:08] coming and so the best thing that we can
[43:11] do is help prepare ourselves for change
[43:13] God helped me be prepared for whatever
[43:17] is coming at me or to me around the
[43:21] corner the season that we're in right
[43:24] now is changing there's no doubt about
[43:26] it there's something in the realm of the
[43:29] Spirit that's saying to us it's time to
[43:34] make the change it's time to make the
[43:36] move I believe it's because something is
[43:38] coming something powerful is perhaps
[43:41] coming to your life perhaps God wants to
[43:43] make a change in your family it could be
[43:47] that all the tears that you have been
[43:49] praying shedding for your loved ones and
[43:52] the prayers that you've been praying
[43:54] that God has bottled them up the
[43:56] scripture tells us and it could be that
[43:59] that you're approaching that season
[44:01] where God is going to pour those prayers
[44:03] and tears out on the head of your loved
[44:06] ones and bring them to salvation through
[44:09] Jesus Christ and and if that is the case
[44:13] then you want to be in the right
[44:14] position
[44:15] you you want to be carrying the right
[44:17] attitude and the right spirit you want
[44:19] to be the peacemaker in your family for
[44:23] such a time as this the Bible says in
[44:26] Isaiah chapter 54 and verse 17 no weapon
[44:30] that is formed against thee shall
[44:31] prosper and every tongue that shall rise
[44:34] against the in judgment thou shalt
[44:36] condemn this is the heritage of the
[44:40] servants of the Lord and their
[44:43] righteousness is of me sayeth the Lord
[44:47] why insert that verse of scripture right
[44:51] here because I want you to know God's
[44:53] got it he's got it he has the
[44:56] righteousness that we need to move
[44:59] forward in what
[45:00] the season holds for us we must not be
[45:04] afraid do not fear the Bible tells us
[45:08] Jesus spoke those words over and over
[45:11] again do not be afraid fear not because
[45:15] he knew that fear has the potential of
[45:19] causing you to miss what God has for you
[45:23] if you allow fear to overwhelm you in
[45:27] that in that moment when God steps on
[45:31] the scene on your behalf you can be so
[45:34] distracted by your own emotion that
[45:37] you're actually running away from God's
[45:38] purpose and plan instead of running
[45:41] toward it that's why you've got to trust
[45:43] him you've got to know that God has this
[45:46] it doesn't matter what you've been
[45:48] fighting against through the power of
[45:51] prayer and faith in Jesus name it has to
[45:54] fall that's what the scripture tells us
[45:57] it doesn't matter who's been saying what
[45:59] God can come and is coming and we'll
[46:04] come to your defense if you'll surrender
[46:07] your heart if you get caught up in
[46:09] defending yourself against the the
[46:13] adversary against the accusers if you
[46:17] get swept away in trying to defend
[46:20] yourself you will miss God's moment in
[46:24] your life he's the one who comes he's
[46:29] the one who will defend you if you keep
[46:32] your heart and your trust toward him
[46:37] anchored in him centered on him God said
[46:42] that every tongue that rises against you
[46:45] he would condemn it I'm believing that
[46:48] for you
[46:49] I believe there's someone watching this
[46:51] program that needs that very word so I'm
[46:55] going to read it to you I'm reading it
[46:58] to you and prophesying it to you from
[47:01] the word no weapon that is formed
[47:04] against you shall prosper and every
[47:07] tongue that shall rise against you
[47:10] in judgment you shall condemn this is
[47:14] the heritage of the servants of the Lord
[47:16] and their righteousness is of me sayeth
[47:19] the Lord this is a promise that you and
[47:22] I can take a hold of no matter what is
[47:24] coming in the next season of God's
[47:27] dealings in our life there's no doubt
[47:30] about that perhaps there's something
[47:33] that you were trying to do before but
[47:35] you just couldn't quite do it and that
[47:38] could be because you were doing it in
[47:39] your own power perhaps there's something
[47:42] that you've been racking your brain over
[47:44] trying to figure out something you've
[47:46] been praying about a wall that you
[47:49] haven't seemed to be able to climb over
[47:51] a situation that you haven't been able
[47:54] to change no matter how hard you've
[47:56] tried a problem that just wouldn't go
[47:59] away I've got a feeling that if you will
[48:03] take God that is promised in this hour
[48:05] that some of these very situations that
[48:09] we're suggesting or mentioning now that
[48:12] could be a part of what God desires to
[48:15] change in your life right now
[48:19] I believe there are things that that
[48:22] maybe stay the same through a season and
[48:27] maybe even another season comes and
[48:30] there are changes that it brings but
[48:33] then there are things that that remain
[48:35] the same and we keep pressing for them
[48:37] and believing for them because we're
[48:40] moving toward the perfect will of God in
[48:44] all of our lives there is still to this
[48:49] day there are lives that must be won for
[48:53] God souls that must be won for God and
[48:57] we will not do it perhaps in the absence
[49:01] of problems we will have our problems we
[49:04] will have our tests we're going to have
[49:06] our our trials it's just part of life
[49:09] they're going to be temptations that
[49:11] that come against us but but staying up
[49:17] making sure that you're not dragging
[49:20] behind in the Spirit of God is
[49:24] an important thing to look at in this
[49:27] hour I just want to emphasize that to
[49:30] you the impossibility that has held back
[49:34] the potential in your life and your walk
[49:37] with God that which has been so
[49:40] impossible can quickly become possible
[49:45] as you step forward into the change that
[49:50] God is calling you to in this hour if
[49:52] you want to see beautiful change
[49:56] executed in your life you may find that
[49:59] there are some things you have to change
[50:01] to make preparation for it could be that
[50:04] you need to focus in prayer a little
[50:06] more it could be that you need to spend
[50:09] a little more time in praise and worship
[50:11] a little more time searching the
[50:13] scriptures to hear what God would say to
[50:15] you through his word I don't want to I
[50:18] don't want to give this impression that
[50:20] all these things are just automatic and
[50:22] they fall upon us at the same time but I
[50:25] want to tell you that what God has got
[50:27] for you according to his word the
[50:29] heritage that he has for you the the
[50:32] heritage of the servants of the Lord
[50:34] that he has for you and the
[50:36] righteousness that he has laid up and
[50:39] prepared for you it's worth what God has
[50:42] for us is worth the preparation it's
[50:46] worth making the effort to make sure
[50:49] that we are tuned up that we are in tune
[50:53] with the sound of God's purpose for our
[50:57] life you know the the instruments all
[51:00] they make beautiful music but they can
[51:03] get out of tune especially those
[51:05] stringed instruments they can get out of
[51:07] tune and you have to come and and tune
[51:10] them and what if everybody tuned their
[51:12] instrument to their own ear and they
[51:15] didn't have the perfect pitch well then
[51:17] no instrument would ever be able to
[51:19] compliment the next and that's why there
[51:21] has to be a a you know there's got to be
[51:26] a what is the word I'm a standard there
[51:31] has to be a standard key that we can
[51:35] tune the
[51:36] to an a has to be an a a G has to be a G
[51:40] and we tuned to that may God give you
[51:44] grace to tune your life to tighten up
[51:49] the string maybe your maybe you're too
[51:51] tight
[51:51] maybe maybe you you have to loosen up a
[51:54] little bit in a certain area of
[51:56] intensity loosen up a little bit so that
[51:59] you can meet that standard that God has
[52:03] so really it's it's such a beautiful
[52:06] hour it really is because this is a time
[52:10] that we get to just say Lord I'm open
[52:15] I'm open to you whatever you want to do
[52:18] in my life
[52:20] just speak just show me just direct me
[52:24] and and I don't have to have all the
[52:26] answers tonight if you'll just help me
[52:29] make the next step I'll step out in
[52:32] faith to make the next step if you'll
[52:35] just show me what that little tiny next
[52:37] step is and I've found so many times
[52:40] through the years of my life that God
[52:42] works that way I like it when you get
[52:45] the whole book at one time you just read
[52:46] through it and you know you know exactly
[52:48] how things are going to come you get the
[52:50] instruction manual but that's really not
[52:52] a life of faith is it a life of faith is
[52:55] God giving you some some opening some
[52:57] doors for you and you stepping into
[52:59] those doors not knowing where where the
[53:01] road leads not knowing where you're
[53:04] going where this is leading but you just
[53:08] keep taking one step at a time one day
[53:10] at a time as God opens up more of his
[53:13] beautiful plan in your life I feel like
[53:16] this has been a bit scattered but I also
[53:18] feel like God is speaking to somebody
[53:20] and I'm willing if if there's so many
[53:25] that perhaps can't relate to what I'm
[53:27] saying but if there's one of you out
[53:29] there that you can relate to this season
[53:31] change because you've been feeling it
[53:34] coming and you've got a little bit of
[53:37] anxiety a little bit of uncertainty but
[53:40] you really want to be able to trust the
[53:43] Lord for your near future then I want to
[53:46] minister to you it's worth it to be able
[53:48] to speak to you
[53:49] whatever it is God has got the provision
[53:54] he has got the instruction you know you
[53:58] may be guessing what the next step is
[54:00] but he already knows when God looks upon
[54:03] your life he sees the beginning from the
[54:06] end and the end from the beginning and
[54:08] he sees everything in between and he's
[54:12] chosen a path for you to walk and my
[54:16] responsibility and your responsibility
[54:18] is just walk soft walk sensitive walk in
[54:23] prayer make sure that your heart stays
[54:26] connected to him let me pray for you
[54:28] right now father I thank you that you
[54:30] have such leadership by the Holy Spirit
[54:34] in our lives you can speak to us in the
[54:39] depth of who we are and lead us by your
[54:44] spirit it is not an audible voice most
[54:48] of the time that we hear but that inner
[54:51] leading that comes by the Spirit someone
[54:55] is watching this program today who
[54:59] desperately needs to be reminded that
[55:02] you have got something bigger and better
[55:05] perhaps in the next chapter of their
[55:09] life but they've got to be led and
[55:13] they've got to have grace to be able not
[55:18] to step out of your Divine Plan right
[55:21] now so lord I pray this very moment that
[55:27] you would comfort them and direct them
[55:29] and breakthrough on their behalf
[55:34] reminding them that as the season of
[55:38] their spiritual life changes you will be
[55:41] with them every step of the way lord I
[55:45] pray that there will come an anointing
[55:48] for this season whatever it is whatever
[55:51] it looks like as long as we know we have
[55:54] your grace and as long as we know your
[55:56] anointing is upon us fresh your mercies
[56:00] are new every
[56:01] we can walk on we can journey on we can
[56:06] believe on and have faith that you will
[56:09] see us to the end of this race we ask
[56:12] for this grace for this blessing thank
[56:16] you that you're the healer we call on
[56:18] you for the sick and the afflicted in
[56:20] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[56:23] pray amen and amen so take this away God
[56:29] has got this he's got it the enemy wants
[56:33] us to be nervous because he knows that
[56:36] he can disturb our peace and place fear
[56:40] which is a paralyzing factor and if we
[56:44] if we get under that spirit of fear
[56:46] we're paralyzed and we won't go anywhere
[56:48] we won't journey on we won't move
[56:50] forward into the things that God has for
[56:52] us so I'm just asking the Lord to
[56:55] release every one of us from the
[56:58] influence of that spirit of fear let his
[57:00] perfect love surround you in this hour
[57:02] and may God give you the direction and
[57:05] the instruction that you're looking for
[57:07] in your life don't be afraid to step
[57:10] forward and move on to whatever it is
[57:13] that God has for you I really appreciate
[57:15] your faithfulness to watch this program
[57:18] and you know how to contact us and we'll
[57:22] be back again
[57:23] may the Lord richly bless you bye bye
[57:26] for now
