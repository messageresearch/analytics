[0:13] hello everybody I'm Pastor step Shelly
[0:16] of the New Hope Revival ministries we've
[0:19] just been taping our television program
[0:21] the Eagles cry we're so grateful to God
[0:24] for giving us the opportunity of being
[0:26] able to have a little part in getting
[0:28] the message of the Gospel El to the
[0:30] nations of the world I wanted to take
[0:32] just a few minutes to invite you to our
[0:35] camp meeting this year it's our 21st
[0:39] International camp meeting and I'd like
[0:41] for you to come and be a part of it uh
[0:43] there for a few years we were calling
[0:46] our Gatherings a conference and then we
[0:48] just decided that we were not being
[0:50] faithful to Our Roots so last year we
[0:53] said we're not going to call this a
[0:55] conference we're going to call it a camp
[0:57] meeting and uh I believe the atmosphere
[1:00] was different I really do uh I think
[1:03] just in in changing the theme a little
[1:05] bit and and the name of our gathering I
[1:07] think it just sort of give us a a little
[1:10] bit of a step back in into our heritage
[1:12] and into our Roots the anointing of God
[1:15] was there we heard some marvelous
[1:17] messages there was some amazing
[1:20] demonstrations of the power of God in
[1:22] Ministry the Lord was just faithful and
[1:25] I know he's going to be faithful again
[1:27] this year I think most of you know know
[1:30] that Paul Keith Davis of White Dove
[1:32] Ministries and I have been friends for
[1:34] over seven years now we so appreciate he
[1:37] and Miss Wanda and we appreciate their
[1:40] Ministry we know him to be a man of
[1:42] integrity and a very good friend and
[1:44] we're excited that he's going to be
[1:46] coming back it's been quite a few years
[1:48] now that he has come to us at least once
[1:51] a year and sometimes twice a year and
[1:54] we're also going to be having Chuck
[1:55] Pierce again I think this will be his
[1:58] third year with us and we just feel real
[2:00] honored we're just a small church here
[2:03] in Smith Station Alabama and Chuck
[2:06] laughs that he has a hard time even
[2:08] finding us on the GPS but somehow the
[2:12] Lord uh helps us to bring in men of
[2:14] quality and integrity like Chuck and
[2:17] Paul Keith and not only that the spirit
[2:19] of God brings people from all over the
[2:22] nation to come and be a part and we even
[2:24] have some International guests to visit
[2:27] us every year so we're looking forward
[2:29] to our 21st International camp meeting
[2:32] this July 10th through the 14th 2013
[2:37] that's Wednesday night through Sunday
[2:39] morning now Chuck Pierce will only be
[2:42] with us on Wednesday night the 10th and
[2:45] Thursday morning the 11th but Paul Keith
[2:48] Davis and I well we'll be doing our part
[2:50] for the rest of the weekend I know that
[2:53] God's going to show up I know the word
[2:55] is going to be preached I know there's
[2:57] going to be signs wonders and
[3:00] demonstration as God comes to vindicate
[3:03] and confirm his word the only thing that
[3:05] I can think of that would make our camp
[3:07] meeting any more special would be to
[3:09] have you to come and be a part of it I
[3:12] want to mention that we were able to
[3:15] block some rooms in some of the area
[3:17] hotels for a few days it looked a little
[3:20] scary there because there's a large
[3:22] convention going on in the Columbus
[3:24] Georgia area at the same time of our
[3:26] camp meeting but I got the word today
[3:28] that we were able to block the same
[3:30] number of rooms the only difference is
[3:33] the cut off date is going to be much
[3:35] earlier this year what that means is
[3:38] you'll need to go to our website find
[3:41] the hotel that you'd like to stay in and
[3:43] book it as soon as possible because we
[3:46] don't want you to miss out on being a
[3:48] part of our camp meeting I can hardly
[3:51] wait to see you I'm believing God for
[3:55] greater things and I I just trust and
[3:57] hope that the spirit of God will bring
[3:59] you our way now we don't have any kind
[4:01] of registration fee but we do ask that
[4:04] people register ahead of time so that we
[4:07] can know how many are coming we have a
[4:10] limited number of seats in our sanctuary
[4:12] and we just want to make sure that we
[4:14] are not completely overrun although we
[4:17] could do an overflow if we needed to
[4:20] it'd be wonderful to have you God bless
[4:23] you come if you can bye-bye
