[0:00] sometimes i just like to ask people
[0:01] whose donkey are you
[0:11] this is why
[0:12] winning the mind battle is so important
[0:15] because the mind battle comes to
[0:18] accomplish two things
[0:20] it comes to separate you from christ
[0:24] and it comes to separate you from one
[0:27] another
[0:31] you see he comes to divide us
[0:34] from christ
[0:36] to isolate us
[0:38] from the reality of the word
[0:40] he comes also this mind battle this this
[0:44] enemy who comes to march against our
[0:47] mind and our thoughts he comes to divide
[0:50] us from god to separate us from our
[0:53] origin
[0:55] you see i came from god
[0:57] you understand that don't you and i'm
[0:59] going back to god
[1:01] if the enemy can separate me from my
[1:03] origin he separates me from my daily
[1:06] existence
[1:09] and so my relationship with christ if my
[1:12] relationship with christ is broken i'm
[1:14] no longer i'm no longer overcoming
[1:17] anything we must make up our mind that
[1:20] we're a part of a building that's being
[1:22] fitly framed and joined together i tell
[1:25] you what i delight i delight in the
[1:29] thought of making the enemy's plans and
[1:32] plots fail what you have meant to do to
[1:36] divide or to hinder or to keep us
[1:38] defeated and discouraged and depressed
[1:41] in every trick that you have tried to
[1:43] play on us i rejoice in knowing that you
[1:47] will ultimately be defeated and the
[1:49] bride of jesus christ will continue to
[1:53] grow up into that holy temple dedicated
[1:57] consecrated set apart for the sacred to
[2:01] the presence of the lord
[2:03] so you can huff and puff and try to blow
[2:05] the house down but what you don't don't
[2:07] remember sometimes is it's built on the
[2:09] foundation of the apostles and the
[2:11] prophets the bride will stand
[2:14] she will stand
[2:16] she's built on the word and the lord
[2:18] jesus christ is the chief cornerstone
[2:22] holding it locking it all together
[2:25] so you tell the devil you're going to
[2:26] possess the reins of your own mind
[2:28] sometime i'd just like to ask people
[2:30] whose donkey are you
[2:33] who's riding on your back
[2:35] how long are you going to give him a
[2:36] saddle to ride in
[2:38] how long are you going to surrender the
[2:40] reins of your own mind to the one that's
[2:42] out to destroy you
[2:44] make up your mind today i'm going to
[2:46] possess them myself
[2:48] i'm not on a runaway train i'm not on a
[2:51] runaway donkey i'm not a runaway horse
[2:54] no siree
[2:56] i'm a thoroughbred
[2:58] and when that word goes forth i know
[3:00] exactly what i must do to line myself up
[3:03] with that
