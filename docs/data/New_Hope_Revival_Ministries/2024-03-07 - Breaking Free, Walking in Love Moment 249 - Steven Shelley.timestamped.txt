[0:00] we not only have a journey before us but
[0:02] we've had a journey behind us and today
[0:05] many of us become the product of our
[0:07] past but I want you to know something
[0:09] the blood of Jesus is powerful enough
[0:12] and the grace of God has enough power
[0:15] and authority in that to set us free
[0:18] from the past we don't have to be today
[0:21] a a product of where we come from
[0:24] Hallelujah we may not have known love we
[0:27] may not have grew up in a warm and
[0:29] loving and environment but we can break
[0:31] that cycle because that's what the blood
[0:33] of Jesus has done for us as long as we
[0:37] use our past for an excuse we'll never
[0:39] grow up into the stature of the perfect
[0:42] man we must come to a place where we
[0:46] recognize that we are not that old man
[0:49] Hallelujah behold all things have become
[0:51] new the old man is dead and therefore
[0:55] everything that made him warped him
[0:58] deformed him all of that is behind us
[1:02] the grace of God and the blood of Jesus
[1:04] has given us a new birth we're no longer
[1:07] just born of planet Earth but we're born
[1:09] again which means born from above and we
[1:13] don't have to continue to to hobble
[1:15] around in with crippled feet because we
[1:18] were dropped there comes a place where
[1:20] we stick our broken feet under the
[1:22] master's table like mbth did and we are
[1:26] now Children of the king we were singing
[1:29] that song over and over again this
[1:31] morning I'm no longer a slave to fear
[1:34] but I'm a Child of God I pray that is
[1:37] our testimony I pray that you have won
[1:40] the battle over fear if you are still
[1:43] living a fearful life you'll never be
[1:46] able to Break Forth into what he's
[1:47] called you to but there's only one
[1:49] answer for that kind of fear and that's
[1:52] God's perfect love perfect love does
[1:55] what to fear It cast it out it drives it
[1:59] way so when we recognize and embrace the
[2:04] mature love of God for us it causes fear
[2:08] to settle down and move out it causes
[2:11] anxiety to leave us the Bible said he
[2:14] wanted to give us a high priest who
[2:17] could be touched with the feeling of our
[2:19] infirmities so Jesus was God but he
[2:22] became Man In the Flesh so that he could
[2:26] understand what it means to live an
[2:28] Earthly life as a man who was full of
[2:32] God and so when we look back at the
[2:35] characters of The Bible the prophets of
[2:37] old because as these Great Men of the
[2:40] Bible overcame their complexes to be
[2:43] used of God in a mighty way brother
[2:45] brandom did as well and you and I will
[2:48] be able to overcome our
[2:50] complexes our temper breeding temper
[2:53] we'll overcome our anxiety and our fear
[2:56] and our Hang-Ups we'll get above our w
[2:59] shorts our crooked noses and whatever
[3:03] else may be wrong with us and we'll be
[3:05] caught up into that atmosphere of love
[3:09] where love breeds
[3:15] love
