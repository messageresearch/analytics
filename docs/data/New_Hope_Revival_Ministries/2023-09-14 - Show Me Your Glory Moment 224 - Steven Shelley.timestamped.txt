[0:12] right now this is fresh
[0:15] he said this is the new season you're
[0:17] coming into and I want you to pray when
[0:19] you don't know what to do when you don't
[0:22] know what to say when you don't know how
[0:24] to feel
[0:26] I want you to pray Lord
[0:29] show me
[0:31] Your Glory
[0:34] I see the trial I see the characters of
[0:38] the drama
[0:39] I see what is happening around me but
[0:43] Lord in the midst of all of that let me
[0:46] catch a glimpse
[0:49] of your glory
[0:52] what is the purpose that your glory is
[0:56] trying to bring about in my life
[1:00] I don't wanna a cheap thrill
[1:03] In Praise
[1:06] I'm not just looking for a sensation
[1:10] when I praise
[1:13] I am Longing To encounter the glory
[1:18] the kavod the heavy Shekinah are
[1:24] Shekinah of his presence
[1:28] the kind that settles the matter
[1:32] you you you're one moment I don't know
[1:35] what to do I don't know what to do I
[1:36] don't know what to do show me
[1:40] Show Me Your Glory and His glory can
[1:45] settle down over you and in that moment
[1:47] you see it's like the light switch has
[1:51] turned on it's like isaf has been
[1:55] applied to your eyes and now you're not
[1:58] just looking at the dark circumstances
[2:00] or the direness of your situation but
[2:02] you're beginning to see how the glory is
[2:04] going to manifest when I get through
[2:07] this the glory of God
[2:10] is going to have accomplished everything
[2:12] that I could never have begun
[2:15] to accomplish in my own self you let the
[2:18] glory fall you let the glory fall now
[2:21] it's important to note
[2:24] that in this experience that Moses had
[2:28] God Almighty came
[2:31] how was Moses able to write in the
[2:34] beginning
[2:34] God created the heavens and the Earth
[2:36] and God said and God did and God said
[2:40] and how was Moses able to write that
[2:43] because God encountered him hello
[2:46] he encountered him on the mountain
[2:48] when Moses cried out
[2:50] show me thy Glory when Moses saw where
[2:55] God had been and what God had done in
[2:57] the past when Moses was given an
[2:59] opportunity to see the hinder parts of
[3:01] God he understood who God is
[3:04] and he was able to see that no matter
[3:07] how dark it got
[3:09] the glory was going to light the path
[3:12] but I'm here to tell you that if you
[3:14] will allow the glory of God to show up
[3:16] in your life in this coming season if
[3:20] you will stop limiting God
[3:23] by being the weapon formed against
[3:25] yourself
[3:28] if you will quit letting the old Cycles
[3:33] and they all paradigms hold you back and
[3:37] you will start praying with me Lord
[3:41] show me
[3:43] thy Glory
[3:45] he'll come to you in your darkest moment
[3:48] he'll come to you in the Midnight Hour
[3:51] hallelujah hallelujah he'll light up the
[3:55] darkness
[3:56] he will lead you and guide you and give
[3:58] you peace
[4:00] you will come out of that experience
[4:02] knowing exactly what God is calling you
[4:05] to in this hour
