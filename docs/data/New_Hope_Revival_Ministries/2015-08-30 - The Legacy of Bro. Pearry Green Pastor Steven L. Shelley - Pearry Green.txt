Description:
“Remember your leaders [for it was they] who brought you the word of God; and consider the result of their conduct [the outcome of their godly lives], and imitate their faith.” Hebrews 13:7 (AMP)

Pastor Steven L. Shelley shares a heartfelt message on the life and ministry of Bro. Pearry Green and the impact this man of God had on a generation of believers.

“I’m caught up in the inspiration,” Pastor Steven shares, “of a life that’s been lived before me, and I’m determined to walk in those legacy footsteps.”

Bro. Pearry Green was an eyewitness to the life and ministry of Rev. William M. Branham. He was the pastor of Tucson Tabernacle in Tucson, Arizona for almost 50 years - faithfully recounting the many miracles and testimonies he had seen and heard through the ministry of Bro. Branham.

This message was taped at the memorial service of Bro. Pearry Green on August 30, 2015 at Charity Tabernacle in Tucson, Arizona.

[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Oh [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and Oh God [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen s-sir testimony job live that before the Holy Ghost was available and he still had that testimony I trust God would give us all that grace and that anointing to give us even what Joe bad to be able to have that testimony though he slay me yet I'll trust you it's a privilege and honor to ask brother Steve Shelly to come up family he's requested longtime friend I knew Steve when he was j hi2 now he was actually about my age so anyway I can tell a story on her but it's good have those steve shelley with us and i trust that he would find the mind of the lord and you just pull and not push god bless you praise the Lord I appreciate the presence of the Lord in this place already don't you I want to greet you in the mighty and precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ I want to say to the family that you have given me the greatest honor of my life thank you for asking me to share in this moment with you I do not feel worthy and I recognize that there are other ministers in this room who are more qualified and much better speakers than I I'm deeply humbled but I am reporting for duty let me also say that I will read most of my thoughts and that is as much for your sake as it is for mine that way I won't ramble nearly as much in my nervousness and one more thing I will most likely cry and I brought a stack just in case one was not enough and there are no apologies for that my head is a leaky head and it's because my grandmother told me when I was just starting out it's okay to cry son it's alright to leak a leaky head rarely swells so I'm a leak the last few lines of a Longfellow poem the psalm of life that brother branham often quoted to us lives of great men all remind us we can make our lives sublime and departing leave behind us footprints on the sands of time footprints that perhaps another sailing or life's solemn main a forlorn and shipwrecked brother seeing shall take heart again let us then be up and doing with a heart for any fate still achieving still pursuing learn to labor and to wait the Apostle Paul said in first Corinthians chapter 4 verse 15 for though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ yet you have not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel everyone leaves behind a legacy after they die but only a few people leave behind a legacy worth talking about a legacy is the story of someone's life it is the things they did the places they went the goals that they accomplished even their failures make up their legacy legacy is a mark left behind to be remembered by perhaps the part of a person that lives on long after that person has departed this life our examples become pathways that sometimes guide people in the decisions that they make what to do and sometimes even what not to do for instance when we think of brother Branham so many things come to mind about his character one of which would be his legacy of humility and of total yielded nice to God this inspires us to ask God for more grace grace that we might walk for him in greater humility and in true yielded 'no status the desire of every believer we want to follow in the example of the Prophet who has gone before us we also recognize that some have left legacies that have served more to show us what we do not want to do or how not to behave this can also be a positive force in shaping us to become better Christians better citizens better neighbors sometimes the ability to identify the failures of those who have walked before us can be extremely important so that we do not inadvertently continue the cycle or repeating the same mistakes leaving behind a greater wake of pain and devastation but it is too late after we are gone to think about the legacy that we are leaving behind it behooves us all as children of God to examine our lives now and to check to see if we are creating a legacy example worthy to be followed is it an example worthy of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ is it an example worthy of the message of the hour the revelation of Jesus Christ it should be the desire of any godly people group to spare the next generation the pain of having to learn everything the hard way and yet we hear people around us often say things like oh they just want a shortcut they don't want to pay the price like we paid so let them learn themselves when they hit rock bottom they'll come asking us running to us for help something is seriously awry that should not be our attitude at all while it may be true church that some things are better caught than taught and that some folks will not remember or benefit from a lesson that they did not personally experience it is also true that there are many eager and hungry young folk out there who end in here who wait to hear the experiences of those who have been there and already done that we have to stop and take the time now to consider the example that we are setting before them god help me we must stop and not only become teachers for teachers can become a dime a dozen but there is a real need in the body of Christ and even a real need in the world at large for legitimate fathers in Jesus Christ a generation striving to display the characteristics and attributes truths and revelations we must be vigilant in our efforts to continue to prepare the way we must consciously strive to gather out the stones of stumbling and raise the blood-stained banner of holiness and truth high in this wicked hour just as Isaiah prophesied hear me please go through go through the gates prepare ye the way of the people cast up the highway gather out the stones lift up a standard for the people behold the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world say ye to the daughter of Zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him and his work is before him and they shall call them the holy people the redeemed of the Lord and thou shalt be called sought-out a city not Forsaken we must therefore assist not only our children but others who have a desire to learn of the things that some of us have been blessed to hear for so long now and we must set the legacy example for them by obeying the Word of God that we have heard even as we also continue to grow in grace in Satan's Eden there is a Miskin sited and misplaced understanding of what a true hero really is would you agree children are often heard to say about a sports star or some pop star singer I want to be just like him I want to be just like her even actors and actresses are set up as role models and they're unhealthy and/or ungodly habits are styles that are often copied by the masses and the church has not dodged the same trend and neither have some of our own assemblies and this should not be what a shame it is in our society when blatant and in-your-face perversion is celebrated as courageous and heroic while policemen and firemen those who serve in the branches of our military are often overlooked as heroes when missionaries risk their lives and the lives of their families to take the good news of Jesus Christ to the far reaches of planet Earth to take the message of the hour to those who have never heard laboring to shine a light to the darkest lives blinded by sin and false religion these men and women are real heroes paving a legacy path for others to follow pointing souls to Jesus and telling them that we all need a genuine born-again experience to anchor us to the Word of God every person you're gonna want you're wondering I know what is any of this got to do a brother green is coming probably every person under the sound of my voice can quote or is at least familiar with what some of us have called the theme of brother branham's ministry hebrews 13 and 8 says jesus christ the same yesterday and today and forever and indeed he is how true these words are and how genuinely they have been demonstrated for us just a generation ago however most of us are not familiar with the verse prior to that passage that favorite passage of brother branham Hebrews 13 and 7 the verse before says this remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken unto you the Word of God whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation and then verse 8 follows Jesus Christ the same yesterday I'm going to do an unpopular thing I've read from the King James but I'm going to quote in another version don't throw anything at me please the Amplified Bible says remember your leaders and superiors in authority for it was they who brought to you the Word of God observe attentively and this can mean to examine carefully and even to scrutinize which suggests to look at through a magnifying glass or to go through their lives with a fine-tooth comb and consider their manner of living the outcome of their well-spent lives and this is the phrase that I think is so outstanding and imitate their faith imitate their faith the literal meaning of following their faith in King James is to imitate it not to imitate them which can sometimes become a uniform for folks with mannerisms and belt buckles etc just trying to identify but there is a much higher way to be identified with the truth a man the original words here do not suggest that we become an imitation or an impersonation of these men who have gone before us it does not indicate that we should impersonate or or in or be an imitation of their personality but rather that we become a carbon copy a genuine duplicate of their faith we are implored here by the Apostle to follow carefully in the footsteps of their faith the manner in which they relied on God with complete trust and confidence and to model our lives after that part of who they were by now you're wondering what all this has to do with brother green and since I haven't barely mentioned his name thus far but even without directly mentioning his name after every sentence this message has everything to do with brother green to meet brother green now this is going to be a little repetitive but and if I would have had a pencil and paper I would have just marked it off as brother caleb was speaking and brother and brother Dale was speaking and brother Richard speaking but it's electronic and I couldn't mark it off and I'd lose my place so I'm going to read it anyway to meet brother green was to encounter a person bigger than life itself be reminded for a moment of the first time you met brother green and what he might have said or how you may have felt and you'll probably concur with me that your life was somehow never the same after that I remember well the first time I met him I'd heard his sermons I'd heard his testimony I had read Acts of the Prophet but it was on the platform of the Mesa Church where our dear brother carpenter has faithfully served God all these years I was invited to speak for the Arizona fellowship meetings so you know it was a long time ago it was a Friday night November the 1st 1991 it'll soon be 24 years ago I came out of the office and he grabbed me with a bear hug brother Steve I'm brother green welcome to Arizona and my life was different in many ways from that hug forward I would then preach at the Tabernacle over 20 services in the following few months those tapes were then heard around the world and doors were opened for my ministry in many nations my life was certainly brighter and a whole lot busier because I had been hugged by brother green in the years that followed many things transpired I'm going to be very transparent and I hope I don't make you too uncomfortable in the years that followed many things transpired and in my youthful zeal and my religious fervor matched with my own ignorance I without intent without malice disappointed brother green it was never what I wanted to do sister green but nonetheless it's our history I didn't hear from him for a while like I had grown accustomed to he just simply backed off and really it didn't feel like the right thing at the time but it was the right thing for me and I just did what I'd always done when I knew that I had hurt or disappointed someone that I greatly respected I pulled away and the years ticked by making it even harder to reconnect I'm sharing this today thinking that I may not be the only person who has experienced a temporary setback in their relationship with this great general of the faith brother Green was sometimes referred to as the Paul Harvey of the message because he was so good to dig and find the treasures the details that others did not see and with this generous heart he would share them with all of us and with Saints around the world of course this reference to Paul Harvey will be lost today on those of you from a younger generation but for the rest of us I'm sharing this personal part of my relationship and friendship with brother Greene because it is really the rest of the story what I want to get to that I want to share I remember pacing back and forth in the den of my home that afternoon palms sweaty mouth dry hmm kind of like right now now the phone is ringing it's too late to hang up my heart is beating fast rings once twice three times oh good he's not at home I can leave a message and then the ringing stopped and that voice boomed in my ear hello this is brother Greene brother Greene this is Steve Shelley Steve what took you so long well at least I knew that it was okay to be calling him but I had to make a quick and important point so I said well brother green may I just humbly suggest that the telephone works both ways silence one two three four five maybe ten seconds of silence I nearly died and then there was a shift in his tone as he said you are exactly right he said now we have lots to catch up on and that we did and we never spoke again of how I had disappointed him it was over someone said did you iron it out no we didn't discuss it ever again it was just done it was finished and I'm so glad it was I want you to help me ponder a question that's been in my heart for some time now it's a question about legacy and one legacy in particular the legacy of our dear friend and brother what is the legacy of Perry green my time this afternoon of course would never allow me to skim the surface of the contributions that he has made to believers around the world some of which have been mentioned but I might just stick in a few here he started printing brother branham's sermons in booklet form even while brother Branham was still alive and in those early days he printed books like 20th century prophet in the seven churches book he was responsible for putting in place the telephone system the hookups that allowed people congregations to hear the sermons and fell apart if they couldn't travel across the country every meeting where brother Branham was speaking I wonder how many tens of thousands of people are now grateful for that effort alone he was so instrumental in spreading the truth of the message across the world with a handful of dedicated pioneers traveling the nations to share the light that it shined in their day and some of those pioneers are in this service imagine how I feel standing here speaking to them about their contributions brother green took his testimony and sermon into 135 Nations remaining faithful to the verse that was already mentioned for we cannot but Speak the things which we have seen and heard but again I want to read it from another version just quickly I was with brother green in Jerusalem I think the last time he was there Janet was with us and a friend of mine had put together some years ago a beautiful Jewish understanding of the New Testament the Old Testament is well called the complete Jewish Bible I took it off the shelf one morning early when brother green had come down and I said I'd like to read you your commission from the complete Jewish Bible well he said I'd love to hear that and I read it x4 20 complete Jewish Bible asks for us we can't help talking about what we have actually seen and heard did he ever chuckle because brother green truly could not help talking about those things that he had witnessed and many of us in this room are very glad that he could not stop the last hours that I was able to spend with brother green in June when he sent for us I say that because it means the world to me and we sat there and and he told stories I knew better I don't know why Caleb didn't learn not to interrupt I knew better take some people little longer I guess my sweet wife and sister greens sitting on us on a swing the fountain gurgling brother green sitting there without his oxygen it was a little shadowy he you know we weren't like staring into one another's eyes and so to me he looked like brother green as I'd always known him full of life full of health but in reality that wasn't quite the situation and my wife and sister Green were just catching up and chatting very quietly to one another but it bothered brother green immensely and he started by saying Janis I called brother and sister Shelly here because brother Steven his wife here too to speak to them honey and I want them to hear what I'm saying and so they hushed for a few minutes something else crossed their mind they started chirping again and he said the second time would you all please let me finish the story and again a few minutes later they chirped again and he looked at me and he said can you do something or yes my wife hadn't spent as many hours with brother bean as I had and so I said sweetheart please and she did after another hour and a half of stories he looked at me and he said all Steve you've heard all these stories before you don't want to hear them again do you yes sir I want to hear them in every detail because if I know you they will be the exact same story that you told me 24 years ago I want to hear it one more time he couldn't help talking about it he was responsible for the films you've heard how many of us have or have had read volume books in our home and what about the black mind the the book sermons that were bound in in black covers that preceded those we all realized that brother green did not accomplish these things on his own as brother Richard has pointed out there was always a group of dedicated brothers and sisters and I'll just skip that but it's not because you're not worthy you're so worthy of our gratitude all of our gratitudes gratitudes all of our gratitude see I better stay right with the notes here we realized that he didn't do it alone there were seed libraries sent and printing of the supernatural series and Israel tours and tours of Jeff and Sunset tours and Tucson tours but I want to ask you a question was this the legacy of brother Perry Green what about his precious family sister green his beautiful three daughters their spouse's grandchildren and greats and his sister Sammy and the siblings that are in the sibling in heaven and and all the relatives gone on I didn't have an opportunity to meet brother greens dad but I sure loved the opportunity to meet granny green all of them nieces and nephews and it ripples on I don't know about you but I love the green family I do because brother green loved them and therefore I love them too some of you understand that don't you they're most definitely a big part of his legacy and family I want to thank you we all want to thank you in fact the bride around the world thanks you for the times that you shared him with us and after I wrote that I realized it didn't sound quite accurate so I'll try again I realized at times for you it felt more like you had given him to us or perhaps that we had just stolen him away from you we're sorry for the times that we may have done just that but today we are grateful for your sacrifices [Applause] amen thank you sister green for all those fateful years of loving brother green and supporting him and of taking such good care of him with your potions and treatments so that we could have him as long as we did sister green we love you and honor you amen if brother green was truly a father in Israel and I believe he was then we're all so blessed to have had a mother in Israel brother Branham told him that the one in his birthday meant he was good at starting things and described him to sister Branham as a man who could get things done when brother Branham except when brother green accepted the call to come with sister green from Texas to Tucson to raise up a church and there remains a group of faithful brothers and sisters to this day at that Tabernacle that where the brand of the double-crosses titi tucson tabernacle and we honor and thank all of you - we love you thank you so much for sharing your pastor with us but is that his legacy for which of these things will he be most remembered maybe that all depends on which of these things are or other things not mentioned may have had the greatest impact on your life but I want to humbly suggest that legacy has to be more than someone's accomplishments it has to extend far beyond the tangible or even the temporal one of the true definitions of legacy and heritage is any attribute or immaterial possession that is inherited from ancestors recordings and books and mission trips and great eyewitness accounts are amazing contributions to us all and all of these things have enriched our lives and certainly have their esteemed place in the tapestry of the legacy of brother Perry Greene but the legacy of brother Perry Greene who was bigger than life itself must also be something bigger something greater something more far-reaching it must extend to the lessons that he taught us that have inspired us and molded us into who we are today it is true that brother Perry Greene loved deeply brother Branham and that was obvious when he shared wherever he was but I also wanted to be membered about him that he loved the Lord Jesus Christ with his whole heart that is what compelled him that is what compelled him to go forward to share the good news he believed in a personal relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ he believed that it's necessary to experience the new birth to be sanctified by the washing of the water by the word and he believed in the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire this too must be added to the list of things that he taught us in his ministry brother green was also a man of grace I'm moving along he knew the grace that had been extended in his salvation and he was willing to believe God for that same grace in all of our lives he was not quick to throw someone away because they stumbled or failed or drew criticism from their particular style of doing ministry brother Greenwood preached to us about Thomas and he said what a shame it was that he was better known for being a doubter when all he really had was a brief moment of weakness he told us that people too quickly forgot that it was Thomas who in the book of John anticipated the threat to the life of Jesus if he returned to Judea after the death of Lazarus but in that moment with courage Thomas boldly proclaimed in chapter 11 verse 16 let us also go that we may die with him brother Greene was so impressed with state with a statement like that from Thomas brother Greene did not believe that failure had to be final with Jesus let this be a part of his legacy remember this that he loved folks even if they had slipped even if they had failed and even if they had wronged or betrayed him personally please don't think that I am here to try to convince you that he was a perfect man for he too was broken don't hurt me sister Sammy he too was broken and flawed he failed as we also failed but because he believed in the power of God's forgiveness and in the power of His mercy and grace he kept on keeping on on more than one occasion brother green described to me personally and probably to others in this room this day yesterday he told me things to look for and I have and then he would see me boiling and he would say please remember son it is not your obligation to get them to love you but it is your obligation to love them this was a constant theme in brother Green's life I won't say it again you've heard him say it over and over again it is not your obligation to get them to love you but it is your obligation to love them that is so powerful it's powerful this was a constant a consistent theme in his ministry is life the entire time that I knew him he wanted you for a friend even if some of his other friends didn't want him to be your friend did you follow that as brother branham said drawing bigger circles which is just simply drawing folks back in with your crayon that have used their crayon to draw you out this sometimes requires us to lay down our prejudices against one another to forgive even if that person never gets around to asking you for forgiveness are you with me forgiveness is more often for ourselves anyway than it really is for the other person because when we forgive we are setting ourselves free while some folks seem to not want others to make it you ever heard conversations like that I have it just sounded like somebody didn't want somebody to make it all the way brother green that was not him I saw in him a desire for us all to make it again this is a huge part of his legacy it may not be a part that you can hold in your hand or visit as a shrine or a memorial but it is a legacy example that is for us all to follow unlike a lot of us preachers brother green actually liked preachers even the ones that did not agree with him boy that's a hard one but it is possible when we realize that we are not the master and it is not up to us but it is up to him and him alone if another one of his servants should stand or fall it has become so easy for us today to split and to divide to even bite and devour I say this so humbly I don't deserve this opportunity to say this to you this is not a scold or a rebuke I'm caught up I'm caught up in the inspiration of a life that's been lived before me and I'm determined to walk in those legacy footsteps it's been easy for us seems to split and divide and even buy it in devour one another but let me just quote some of my Jewish friends that is not kosher and let me tell you how I know that according to Deuteronomy 14 12 among the birds that we should not eat is the eagle if somebody else would have said that you two liked it better but it's still the truth you're still the truth how easy it can be when we're often surrounded by other Eagles to just reach in and take a bite out of one another but with the help of the Lord we can commit today to carry on a part of brother Greene's legacy we can lay down our swords and even our forks and knives and we can make a pledge to quit eating Eagles another legacy lesson he was a faithful man faithful to the one who had called him and faithful to the Commission that he carried boldly and without apology testifying of the things that he saw and heard brother Greenwood go we're invited if he had the opportunity to share his testimony and I personally witnessed a couple things I want to share I saw this humility in action when he was invited to speak in several gatherings of who Pentecostal and charismatic friends I had been assigned to help him navigate the culture of an unfamiliar people to him so I properly warned him of the way that some would be dressed and that their worship would certainly be a bit different than what we were used to but I wish you all could have seen him especially those who criticized him for going I wished you could have seen him that very first night among those folks he walked up on that stage and loosened his tie because he recognized he was the only one wearing one in the building including me and he did ask me where it was he sat down to be interviewed by her friend Paul Keith and then he started doing something I wasn't familiar with he started untying his shoes I'm sitting there right close to the front and I'm thinking oh wow oh no what is he doing brother green went on to take his shoes off set them on the chair beside him I'm thinking oh love oh oh what will he say what will he do next I just hoped that he would leave his socks on and then he said something he said I just wanted to take off my shoes to honor the presence of the Lord among you people people sitting around me started weeping because truly the presence of the Lord then flooded the room of over 500 people 30 minutes before that he said to me in the speaker's room Steve do you think these people will like me will they really want to listen to my stories about brother Branham they don't know so much about it they've read all the garbage about him on the Internet you think that I reassured him that they would love him as I always had he even asked me holding up the pouch of prayer cloths prayed over by brother Branham on that final departure from Tucson to Jeffersonville he said do you think anyone here would like to have one of these I said brother Greene you just better be careful when you lift it up that they don't knock you off the platform to get one but he was still a bit unsure but there he was being faithful not judging who was and who was not just sharing what he knew to be the truth but he was still unprepared for the rush to the front of the room when he offered those folks a cloth prayed over by brother Branham and the look on his face was priceless we do not all have the same callings or Commission's but we too must be faithful to the call that God has placed in our lives amen you'd never think of a confident man like brother Greene being discouraged would you but it happened if you only knew the surface of brother Perry Greene then you would you might have thought well I met a confident man sometimes with a rough exterior and if that's all you knew about him then you only knew one dimension of who he was indeed he was a driven man driven by passion to finish the tasks that he had been called to but he was also wounded when his words and actions or his approach to the message was rejected or misunderstood he did care even if he said at times like we all have I don't care what people think he did care what people thought about him and it did hurt him when someone would say that he did not believe the message that he had given his entire life for but he didn't let it stop him never he would press through the discouragement to remain faithful in every way if you're here today and if you're discouraged and if you feel alone or misunderstood by those around you may I remind you to take courage in my files there's the first handwritten note sent to me by brother Greene he thanks me for my ministry in Tucson and for stirring up within him the gifts that were present in his life he ended that note by saying brother Steve may I say that I love you son be strong I cannot express the deep meaning those words had for me then and again today when we are weak his strength is made perfect in us a man let's lean on our beloved today and find comfort I also want you to know if you had the opportunity to know the man that lived beneath that surface well it may be better described like this in Israel a native-born Israeli is referred to as a what do you know some of you know Sabra Sabra this term alludes to a tenacious thorny desert plant known in English and you'll know it too as prickly pear with a thick skin that conceals a sweet softer interior that cactus is compared to Israeli Jews who are supposedly tough on the outside but delicate and sweet on the inside for me maybe not for you for me this disc brother green and I told him so when we were in Israel and he laughed and said oh you think so do you brother green was faithful to the Lord faithful to the word how often he recalled to us the admonition that brother Branham gave to him keep your balance it was his desire to take this precious message and lay it in the scriptures it's powerful so that cows are not eating grass out of the tops of trees to let it fit the continuity of the word may be an honor of brother green it's time for some of us mostly me to trade in our personal interpretations of this truth and let God interpret it for us by bringing it to pass God is faithful so many have strayed from the simple gospel of Jesus Christ come back come back to your beginning come back to the original Word it is true that we each have to find our journey to Christ but it has to be on his terms and not in the terms that we set for ourselves our terms are more often based on our own wounds and our own fears but his terms are clearly outlined for us in the word this is a bloody way this is a costly way but thanks be to God the price has already been paid on our behalf if your redhot desire to serve God has grown cold you don't have to stay in that condition if you've slid backwards toward this world and it's a lures come home come home to Jesus today you have that opportunity amen if internet reports and carefully worded arguments have discouraged you from the passion you once had to follow in those footprints on the sands of time if you've been shaken because of detail has been misplaced in a sermon or a date was inaccurately quoted lay those things aside and come back to the original Word of God if you become reluctant to share the message with someone because you're nervous about what they might hear or read about brother Branham on the Internet take courage today let us follow in the legacy steps of brother Greene and many others like him let's continue to testify and share with anybody who will listen what the Lord has done in our lives and how he has revealed his word to us it is he only him who can open our eyes to see with eyesalve and give us ears to hear the overcomers message but don't you back off in sharing what you know to be the truth because of Scarecrow's that the enemy has raised up in this hour yes that was a little extra no matter what we do or even what we wear we cannot be holy enough not on our own on our best day all of our righteousness all the righteousness we can muster is still filthy rags in the sight of a holy and just God so we must yield to his righteousness until he fills us with so much of himself that we can reflect the attributes of Jesus but if the fads and fashions of this world have crept into your life and if you have compromised your stand for separation and holiness modesty and if for whatever reason you've returned to the places that you've been called out from and you find yourselves again in the lodges of Babylon hear the cry of God's word come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues let's run back to the blood back to the word let's cling closer to Jesus than ever before and closer to one another because the resurrection is at hand I'm closing my remarks you don't believe me but it's true and I timed myself earlier I want to say that we are heirs to a fine legacy from the man who lived in this house one of faithfulness and stability of generosity and true fellowship but it is up to us how we steward this legacy will we squander it will it be wasted or will we utilize it will we see its true value and follow in these footsteps or will we put it off and choose to ignore it we sorrow we've wept but we've not shed one tear for brother green not one why would we why could we why what it wouldn't be possible every tear that we have shed has been for our selfish selves because we know that our lives as they were changed when he came into them will be somewhat changed as he makes his exit but all thanks be to God there will be another spring we know this is not the end it's just a temporary farewell factor brother green said to me I'll see you in November and then he left or no please I'm not making a doctrine but if it happens in November let it roll hallelujah I'm tired of this pest house it's alright to the home so this is not a farewell no sir no no not a sad goodbye it's more rightly expressed it's our precious brother until we meet again at Jesus feet in fact today could be a new beginning for some of us not an end if we refuse to sit around and reminisce only about what a good man he was or how much we loved him and actually take this inheritance pick up this legacy and go forward not talking about it living it demonstrating it I'm not gonna leave this part out even if I feel the pressure to do so I've received gifts from brother and sister green through the years um and I know caleb has too he just couldn't find them at that moment but the most valuable and priceless thing that brother green ever gave to me took place in a conference that brother green had been invited to speak at in Daphne same conference I mentioned I'm gonna toughen up and get through this part I read it to my wife and sobbed it was during another minister's service another minister was preaching and brother green was sitting next to me near the front of the auditorium and the speaker was speaking about father issues and he asked for everyone in the building who had experienced father issues to stand I honestly felt that I had thoroughly forgiven my earthly dad for his rejection of me but to be honest the thought came to my mind that so many of my own congregation were there and they would indeed know my story and perhaps they would wonder why did I think I was too good for a minute to be ministered to why wouldn't I respond to the call for prayer so I stood the minister began to pray and to my surprise my heart melted again in the presence of the Lord as I recalled the huge hole that had been left in my life by a dad who didn't want to be a part I also felt the touch of nagging fear that had crept in from time to time to announce to me that I would not be a good father because I had no relationship with my own father it became a precious time as I felt the Holy Ghost within reassuring me that I had a father a Heavenly Father who cared and loved me very very much and that he would help me to raise my sons and daughters brother green and I had only been recently reunited this was after our season of being apart in communication and so we hadn't had time to to speak about these things again the details of my personal life and I was truly startled as I was standing there tears running down my face quietly just thanking God for what he had done for me when brother green jumped up it scared me he did it so quickly he jumped up and I opened my eyes and tears I don't know if I'd ever seen brother green cry like this tears were running down his face I remember thinking wow what is this about but before I could even figure out what it was about he had wrapped me in the biggest bear hug of my life well as close as our bellies would let us get and I'll never forget his words almost too personal to share and a few that I will leave off Steve I'm so sorry that your father failed you when you really needed him and most of all I am sorry that when you needed me the most I failed you also I must have looked startled by what he said because he forcefully continued when you needed someone to help guide you and shape you and help you navigate the new world that you had been thrust into I failed you and I'm so sorry can you forgive me I wanted to answer him but all I could do is shake my head and sob louder son I love you tell me what can I do to prove to you that I'm sorry this was so unusual for me to see brother green in this state tell me what can I do all I could say at the moment was just keep loving me brother green he said that I can do and we both sat down we never talked about it again he committed to me later that evening to be there to assist in any way that I ever needed to do the work of the ministry etc skipping skipping skipping I want you to know I never carried a grudge against brother green I was not his personal responsibility but there was something so soothing and healing in his words to me I received them for my life but please hear me carefully but I also knew that in some strange way I was receiving them for many others who needed to hear those words those who felt as I had let down rejected by their own earthly father or let down by their mentors dropped like mephibosheth by someone who was supposed to protect and care for them I also sensed forgive me this moment I also sensed that I was not the only one that brother green was thinking about when he apologized to me that day perhaps he was also thinking of some of you in this very room and I say this so humbly God knows my heart perhaps he was also thinking of some of you in this very room some that may have counted on him in ways that he could not serve you or perhaps some that he did fail to do all that he could do for he was human and he was only one imperfect man in the hands of a sovereign and perfect God but if you are here and that could be your story as crazy as this sounds to some would you please allow me to say the words to you that he spoke to me that day I believe therefore all of us could you allow the Holy Ghost to come and heal you deliver you of any hurt wound rejection that you've carried in your life regardless of who it came from or how it was delivered would you allow the Lord to roll off of you the hurtful words that have been spoken to you or about you through your life whether by your earthly father or those who loved you but had issues of their own to work through would you allow me to call you by the spirit like King David called to mephibosheth son of his best friend Jonathan grandson of King Saul I'm doing that now even without your permission it's time for you to bring your crippled feet and come to the Kings table your handicaps your wounds your hurts will be covered under the protection of his table you'll eat the food of kings and no longer be an outcast in Israel rise up the King of Kings is calling to every mephibosheth everyone who has been dropped or failed or wounded or hurt in your life what brother Greene gave me that day was something similar to what a scripture what the scripture calls a father's blessing we read about it in the lives of the patriarchs of Israel a father would call his sons forward lay hands on their heads speak words of life and encouragement over them sometimes even prophesying their future and outlining their inheritance I'm not blood family - brother Greene and I have no rights or claims to an earthly inheritance however I would like to keep the cowboy boots that he gave me in June that fit like a glove and I would have wore them today if I would have had more courage but I was afraid because the heels were a little high that I would fall over backward while I was trying to speak but let me say that if you're not even if you're not blood relative of brother Greene we are all errors we're heirs we're heirs of a legacy paths footprints to follow in and even shoes to fill so what is the legacy of Perry green as I move toward my seat what is the legacy of Perry green I am you are and you and you and you and you and you and you we are if we keep our eyes on Calvary if we keep pressing toward Jesus Christ if we take our stand with a word then we will be the living legacy of this great man we're not finished here there's other things that will be done but I want to just pray as I leave I'm not even going to ask you to stand because I want them to be able to move in quickly and do what needs to be done I just want to pray I just feel so that it is so important that you let the Lord comfort you if you're hurting we grieve but not as those who have no hope I also think it is vitally important that we pick up this baton and run harder than we've ever run before because we're closer children than we've ever been and also feel like that it's time to be healed the word has come to deliver us and it's also come to heal us and if you're still bearing the marks of pain perdón projection let Jesus do something let him do it wouldn't wouldn't brother aye well you may not believe but I believe brother green would be extremely happy if you left here lighter then you came in so just bow your head just a moment father you're so good to us I've done what I was asked to do and III tried to follow the leading of your spirit I thank you that you helped me get through this I feel as any Minister would standing here the pull of your people because we are a needy people brother Branham often said it and we're as needy or more needy today then that generation was we need healing we need deliverance we need hope some of us have been wounded some of us have been failed and some of us carry roots of bitterness and seeds that we don't like and we need them extracted we need them taken out and we surrender right now to the work of the Holy Ghost come Jesus come precious Lord and heal us pour the healing balm of Gilead soothe us in this moment give us the grace Lord to receive your blessing I'm not a father to these men I'm considered young by some and old by others but I am a father you've given me four amazing children and I'm a pastor to a small congregation so Lord I want to just do what I feel to do and that is to release a blessing over this precious body of believers and we will receive that blessing as coming from your word and we'll call it in this moment of father's blessing the Lord bless thee and keep thee the Lord make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto you the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace Shalom Shalom [Applause]
