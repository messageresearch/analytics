god has for you today because i believe that he has an appointment with every one of us and jesus doesn't miss any of his appointments i've missed a few that he called me to but he didn't miss them now i'm glad that he's here today to keep his appointment with us this is the first sunday of the month and today we're going to receive the tithe and the offering first and then we're going to receive our principal offering as we have been doing for the last couple of months we uh we are grateful for the goodness of the lord the amount that has been given thus far toward the principle is 101 693 dollars and 45 cents that is above and beyond the payments that have been made we are so happy that now it is reversed and more of the payment now goes to the principle than to interest and god is faithful and we're looking for this debt to be complete by the grace of god now i am going to do something a little bit different today and you that have been watching the chosen get used to different all right so the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to have nathan and is david yantus nathan and david are going to come to you for your tithe and your offering michael christian i would like you to come and get the second offering bag i'm doing this for the sake of time but you have to listen to instruction as they come to you for the tithe and offering then i invite you as you have given your tithe and offering so we don't have mass confusion give your tithe an offering and then come and give your principal offering michael will be standing right up here for you to give your principal offering and then we'll let both of these come together and i'll pray god's blessing over it so you brothers go first and then as you give your tithe and offering if you have something for the principal offering you can get up and bring it and put it in the bag that brother michael is holding what a lovely name the name of jesus [Music] reaching higher than the brightest star

give for the work of the lord i bless them in the name of jesus christ now what has been given in tithe and in offering and in this principle offering i thank you lord for the seeds that have been sown and i thank you lord for great harvest oh lord great multiplication back into the lives of the believers may they see it in every way lord your favor in your blessing would you multiply it now for the purposes of the kingdom and may you get all glory in all honor and we continue to give you the praise because you are the faithful provider amen thank you lord would you give the lord a praise today [Applause] we're so happy that you're in the house of the lord with us today and we have a wonderful group of friends from indiana that have come to visit us and we became acquainted with some of these at the youth camp in indiana and then joyce and i were privileged to go to the farm of brother levi and sister elizabeth fisher and and get to know them better and we're so glad that sister elizabeth is here today god chose to take brother levi about a year and a half ago but god has given sister elizabeth grace and she is here with her daughter fanny and her son daniel her son john and her son-in-law john and her daughter sadie where's josiah is he there is he sleeping all right he's on the pew that is john and sadie's son josiah then uh you'll remember we had brother elam and sister mary fisher they were here at uh camp meeting time and this time they brought their son christian so we're glad that they're here with us today and then over here is another one of sister elizabeth's daughters annie her husband john see this makes it a little easier because we have john john and john and so that helps a little bit and they have two little boys stephen and daniel and we are did i get all of them 14 of you all right and we're going to invite them to come and sing this morning will you come we honor you and we thank god for you brother good morning everyone good morning it's so good to be here again and i just really enjoyed the worship and it's encouraging i was uh thinking here this morning about uh the scripture says that uh well peter said that we left all to follow you and jesus said if we leave fathers and mothers and houses and lands and sisters and brothers we'll receive it again in this life with persecutions and eternal life and we've experienced a lot of that when we saw the truth of a lot of what we saw bible truths and uh didn't really line up with the amish beliefs so they couldn't go along with it very well and eventually we saw that it just we just have to move on so it got to the point where we didn't really care anymore if they find out that we're having secret meetings and things like that so during the night and and we found that scripture very true we had to leave the land we were on we were living on my dad's farm and had to leave our houses and brothers and sisters and fathers and mothers but we found others that's precious the lord provided and then i was thinking about uh how this one man said i think he was from over and he was over in one of european countries and it was during the persecution time i think it was either the communists or the or hitler's reign and he said he found out that their greatest enemy was to try to save their lives [Music] he saw that that's what's happening compromising a little here and a little there just to have our life so he he became really bold for the gospel and i think he lives in this country now i don't remember what his name is right now but i thought that was really an interesting point if we lose our life we shall save it if we try to preserve it we're going to lose it and i think that's about where we're in this country there's a tendency to think well we're in america there shouldn't be any persecution here are we willing to stand up and well maybe it's just a little thing but many little things and eventually we come to the point of you know if we're going to continue obeying the government all the time it'll get to the point where are you taking the mark or are you uh there's going to be an antichrist system really so we got to take a stand sometime let's be willing to stand in the small areas too so i bless you [Applause] need a all okay we had such a precious time with brother steve and his family last night and then we sang a couple songs together and he asked us to sing this again today so we want to sing it [Music] me [Music] and i hide in his shelter [Music] is [Music] [Applause] they shall run and not be weary [Music] [Applause] [Music] with temptations all around me [Music] [Applause] [Music] i know he went to calvary [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] in the way [Music] is i will praise [Music] [Applause] [Music] their way [Applause] thank you lord we pray many blessings on these our friends we're glad that they could be here this weekend and as they go back to their home in indiana may the presence of the lord just go with them all the way you know we just want to give this little testimony they pulled in here yesterday and just as they were getting back in the van to move about the van wouldn't start finally they got it started and we went from the campground to charity's house at 10 miles an hour because the van was in limp mode it's all the faster it would go but by the grace of god when they went from charity's house to my house it was just fine it started fine it ran fine and then nathan came and put a test on it identified the problem brother john got the part put it on yesterday afternoon and we're believing the lord that the van is going to be just fine to take him all the way back [Applause] amen these people believe in the power of prayer they're people of faith and we join with them and they join with us we are people of faith believing for everything that god has promised in the end time would you stand with us as we're turning our hearts now to hearing the word of the lord for today what he wants to speak to us we want to hear what he has to say sing this course with us just as brother shelly is getting ready to come he's my lord there is no

doubts and confusions you've even questioned where the lord you prayed in the dark of the midnight when doubt was all i could see oh but while patiently waiting for morning that's when i heard my lord whisper to me you know what he said he said endure indoor till the end [Music] i know you are fighting a battle but you're gonna win oh hold fast at last don't bow don't bend in door indoor till the end now we all know that the lord is soon coming because we see the prophet's words true whoa and now with just a few days remaining tell me what is any good soldier to do sing it with me oh we must

coming because we see the prophet's words coming true oh and now with just a few days remain [Applause] tell me what is a good soldier to do oh we must [Music] [Applause] [Music] i know we're all fighting [Music] don't you bow [Music] [Applause] [Music] the end give me verse one again if you would now you've grown so tired of the conflict the pain and the fire and the storm oh and sometimes in your doubts and confused we've asked a time or two oh tell me where oh where is the lord oh that's when i've prayed in the dark of the midnight when my doubts were all i could see oh but while patiently waiting for morning that's when i heard my lord whisper to me let's stand and sing it together he said endure and or till the end no matter what we face i know we're fighting a battle but the word said we're gonna win oh at last hold fast don't bow down [Music] [Music] by your grace lord by your grace we will by your grace we will can you say amen praise god would you give these who have given their gifts for the lord today a thank you we thank you we appreciate your help turn with me in your bibles if you will to john chapter 16 and we are preaching for some time now on having a personal experience with the lord jesus christ this is not religion this is not church entity this is not following in the traditions of your fathers this is meeting jesus christ face to face with a personal relationship knowing that you have met him that you are known of him and that you know him the bible calls it being born again i want to know that i'm born again i want you to know that you are born again and born again is not just repenting of your sins but there is a process of manifestations of grace that we experience in our lives that complete the process of the new birth justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost without that manifestation of god's grace in our life we are not yet born again we're hung in the birthing canal and we need to come all the way if you believe that say amen john chapter 16 is where we want to read beginning in verse 7 nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient necessary for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if i depart i will send him unto you and we know that in john chapter 14 the lord jesus explains the coming of the comforter in verse 8 he said and when he is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because i go to my father and ye see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged verse 12 i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you do you believe that he will guide you into all truth not just a portion of truth all truth that is not doctrine all truth is not doctrine all truth is a person jesus said i am the way i am the truth i am the life and so doctrine helps us to approach jesus christ it gives us a foundation but our goal is not to become educated our goal is to come into christ thank you lord for making a way that it's possible he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself the spirit of truth will not speak of himself he will introduce someone else he will speak of someone else let's read on he shall glorify me who is the me these are red letters this is the words of our lord jesus christ he will glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine i want you to know some were listening to this and they were boiling they were boiling their blood was boiling because here is a prophet they believed perhaps who was making himself equal to god almighty he was saying all things that the father hath are mine therefore said i that he shall take of mine and he shall show it unto you verse 16 a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and you shall see me because i go to the father i want you to know i for one am thankful that he came and that he went and because of him going he could come in another form he could come in spirit form and live inside of the believer he has left us with a promise and a hope that he will come again and we will see him and know him and be known of him is that right let's go to the lord in prayer father we thank you now for your wonderful presence that has been among us we thank you that we can sense that you're here your word reveals you when we worship you come when an atmosphere of welcome is created you come and now always thank you for it we brought you with us when we came this morning a little deposit of who you are living in our life you came with us and now all of those little individual licks of fire that you've given us by the holy ghost we are some of us united here today bringing back together that little lick of fire so lord truly you are in the midst i pray that your word will accomplish that which it is sent forth to accomplish today we bind the hand of the enemy we take authority over him because we know how he despises the preaching of the revealed word of god we pray lord that you will help us focus on you we know there will be some who are tired in body and weary and even sleepy but we pray lord that you would help us all to hear to be a part to make ourselves a part of what you're saying today we access that by faith and it's faith that you have placed in our lives and we want to use it as you have asked us to to apply it and to use it and we access the whole truth with our faith today and we pray lord that you will continue to have your way bless in our fellowship later in our time together we just want to be filled with the reality of who you are we ask these things in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ yeshua our messiah amen and the church said amen you may be seated please don't get so quiet i i'm a preacher who needs the holy spirit i need the faith pull of the people and i need your amen you're not going to make me nervous with an amen if it's sincere you're going to make me nervous if you don't do something nod your head a little bit smile if you can make yourself a part of what god would say to us today it's very important that we do that because truth makes us free we are walking in a freedom that has been created for us by the truth you know we say very often the truth sets us free but the bible said it makes us free and the word that is used there in the greek is a word that speaks of recreation being remolded and reformed we who have known bondage we who have known slavery are now being made freedom our whole identity is being remolded and reshaped and remade and many of us even after all of these years we're still learning to walk in our new identity as freedom we are free and we're free because jesus has made us thus amen and so we're thankful for that we know what it means to not be free and it makes us more appreciative of what it means to be free i'm going to share just a few of those verses that i just shared in the amplified bible i hope that won't be offensive to anyone i just feel like there are some words and phrases used here that will be a blessing to you so i'm going to read beginning in verse 7. i might read it all i don't know but i'm going to start in verse 7 of john 16 and this is in the amplified version it uses a lot of the original language and a lot of the various words that are used i i find it to be helpful however i am telling you nothing but the truth when i say it is profitable good expedient advantageous for you that i go away i don't know if the disciples would have agreed at that moment they were holding on to the lord they were holding on to fellowship with him i it's just like those who knew the ministry of brother branham and saw god in him they just believed that he would always be with them they kept waiting for the next big thing that god was going to do the disciples the same way they kept waiting they thought any minute he might just shift his ministry and he might run out the occupying roman army and he might give the people political freedom they really didn't know what all was going to happen but they weren't quite ready to hear i'm fixing to leave you you you you need to know i'm getting ready to be out of here so he had to explain to them it's it's advantageous to you it's going to be to your blessing to your benefit that i go because we can't both be here at the same time you know why because they're one in spirit amen how many of you know the holy ghost is not the third member or third person of a godhead but he is another demonstration of the same god the same spirit so you couldn't have jesus the fullness of god in body on the earth and the spirit of god loosened the earth at the same time jesus said i have to go so that he can come but then he said in chapter 14 i will not leave you comfortless i will come to you he was identifying to them by revelation i'm not sending someone else even though he said i'll send you another comforter it was the spirit of the father that was living in him that was going to come back on the believer and be all the comfort that they would ever need i want you to know today jesus is the only comfort that lasts that's enduring that is eternal we can we can have temporary moments of of comfort and contentment it's like the little child i saw last night one of these little boys i don't remember which one it was but i saw as they were holding him there at the end i saw he had a little scab on his knee and i almost touched it and then i thought no it might be sore under there i don't want to touch it and there they were getting used to me anyway the little little fellas were and i didn't want to disturb him but i i saw that little little scab on his knee i remember those scabs i remember having four children that had those scabs i remember myself i i wear a scar most of you don't know it but i have a scar right here on my eyelid that was pretty deep and i have it goes right through my eyebrow and i have it because when i was a child i fell over the handlebars of a bicycle that i was riding on a dirt trail and i went over the handlebars and a stick went up there like that and and cut through and boy i was at an age then i didn't want mama a year before i would have run straight to mama but i was at an age then that that blood dripping down my face i didn't even wipe it i was kind of proud of it i wanted all the other guys to see the blood dripping down my i just kind of wiped it off a little bit like that and went all day when i went home that night and that dried blood on my face and that gash hanging open that needed stitches my mother was so mad at me i said mother i couldn't afford to let the guys know i needed my mama she said it's not sin to need your mother she was comfort to me i know that when that little fella skinned his knee mom and dad they comforted him but it's a temporary comfort it only lasts until they forget the pain it only lasts until the next accident but i want you to know there's a comforter hallelujah there is a comforter that comforts us with a comfort that lasts it is everlasting it is eternal it is not temporary or temporal he said he goes on to say it's profitable good expedient advantageous for you that i go away because if i do not go away the comforter listen and how he is described counselor helper advocate intercessor strengthener standby will not come to you into close fellowship with you i like the way that is described and when he comes he will convict and convince i want you to keep those words in your mind he will convict and convince that's part of the work of the holy ghost to con to convict and to convince he will convict and convince the world and bring demonstration to it about sin about righteousness which is uprightness of heart and right standing with god and about judgment about sin because they do not believe in me trust in rely on and adhere to me about righteousness uprightness of heart and right standing with god because i go to my father and you will see me no longer about judgment because the ruler evil genius prince of this world satan is judged and condemned and sentenced already is passed upon him how many of you can say amen to that i want you to look at the word reprove found in verse 8 of the king james when he is come he will reprove i want to give you the greek definition of that word or the or the english definition from the greek it means to scrutinize or examine carefully so when the holy ghost has come he will scrutinize and examine carefully the world of sin of righteousness and of judgment it goes on to mean to prove guilty to condemn to rebuke to show fault or error it means to convince to convict to expose to bring some shame to the person that is being reproved in the church age book we don't do a lot of quoting from the church age book but if you'll put that little sentence up there i want you to hear what they have taken from the message of brother branham concerning that word it says to rebuke is to reprove to reprove is to expose with a view to correction to expose with a view to correction i wanted to bring that to you because i want you to understand that the work of the holy spirit is not to condemn you the work of the holy spirit is to convict you and to convince you that you cannot do it on your own the king james uses the word condemn and it is a very strong word but how many of you know we read in the book of romans there is therefore now help me no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus so the spirit of god in you is not to condemn you and make you feel hopeless the spirit of god in us by the baptism of the holy ghost is there to cause us to be convinced that we can't do it by ourself but if we lean on him and depend on this relationship we have with him we can overcome all things we can't make it without him you say well you know i'm not sure if i have the holy ghost you've got to know you must know i wish you'd help me preach this morning you must know that you have the baptism of the holy ghost hope so is not enough i wished i did i wish that this is not enough you've got to know that you know that you know that you know that you know because we're facing things now and what we're facing now it doesn't even begin to compare with what we will face we need the helper in us we need the advocate in us we need the one who comes to convince us and to convict us we need him living in us the work of the holy ghost is not finished when we come to christ when we come to the new birth and he first deals with our heart and we pray and cry and repent and we come to justification and then the water washes us by the word and we come to sanctification and then we receive the baptism of the holy ghost he feels so good he feels so good in our life he gives us joy he gives us fire he gives us peace but i want you to know his work is not finished he continues to remain in us to convince us to convict us to guide us to lead us to show us the way when he the spirit of truth is come not only into the world but into the bride when he come into us by the baptism of the holy ghost he is there to guide us he is there to lead us he is there to direct us into all truth he's there to nudge us when we look at the wrong thing he's there to nudge us when we say the wrong thing he's there to nudge us when we think the wrong thing and he doesn't do it with condemnation if if it fills you with guilt and condemnation it's a trick of the accuser it's not the work of the holy spirit the trick of the accuser is to condemn us and make us feel like there is no hope the work of the holy spirit in us is to remind us i will give you power over all the powers of the enemy because i overcame the world you can also overcome we've really got something when we have this holy ghost living on the inside of us we need it somebody said what about the word we now have the word of god reveal we now have that which is perfect we now have the right interpretation and revelation of the lord jesus christ so perhaps we don't really need to emphasize the holy ghost anymore i want you to know we must emphasize our need we must tell our children and our children's children that god has no grandchildren and we must tarry and wade and pray and fast and do whatever else we can do until we know that we have received the baptism of the holy ghost and the fire that purges us from the all of that that inbred sin and gives us deliverance and freedom over all that the enemy is trying to use to destroy us always when the holy spirit comes and convicts he gives us hope and he gives us correction and he shows us a better way there's a higher life when the accuser comes he says you'll never be any better than that you'll never get over that you'll never quit watching you'll never quit saying you'll never quit thinking this is who you are and you always will be when you hear that voice that is not the voice of the holy ghost he don't talk like that i wished i had some help how many of you know what phantom pain is you've heard the word phantom pain they tell me that many times an amputee someone who has a mortal injury serious injury to a to an arm or to a leg and it has to be amputated it has to be taken off they tell me that the brain doesn't catch up right away the brain doesn't recognize immediately that the limb is gone and that it is possible to go for an extended amount of time god bless you josiah i just saw you it's possible to go for a long period of time still feeling awful pain in a foot that's not there in a leg that's not there it's really interesting isn't it because the brain hasn't caught up it hasn't regenerated itself enough to recognize what has happened and what has changed in the body i want you to know that the enemy works like that i want you to know that he wants you to feel the awful guilt of sin that is no longer there because the blood of jesus has already dealt with it he'll cause you to feel guilt and condemnation over something that's already been placed under the blood he's a liar jesus said the father of all lies all the lies come from him and you've got to recognize the difference between the voice of the accuser and the working of the holy spirit of the holy ghost in your life when when he the holy ghost points out something that needs to be changed in your life he does it with such love he does it with such grace because you belong to him now it hurts sometimes we're not talking about the whipping how many of you know them that the lord loves he chastens that is going to make you feel kind of sore for a while that's not what we're talking about the discipline of the lord to make us better disciples this is something that we not only accept it's something that we welcome because if he doesn't discipline us we are none of his but we are illegitimate children so there are times that the work of the lord in our life will bring discipline to us to make us greater disciples for him but it doesn't come with the guilt and the condemnation that the voice of the accuser comes with i want you to understand the difference when we look at that word convict it means to prick a person's heart until he senses and knows that he is guilty of something that does not please the lord i want to just ask you how many of you have ever felt the convicting prick of the lord maybe when we first started to serve him we feel that prick and it would really weigh us down and cause us to feel like another failure it would almost make us wonder if we were really saved how many of you remember in your early christian journey the enemy was always hanging around why you're not a christian why you're not a real believer or you wouldn't think a thing like that but as we become more mature in the word we understand that it doesn't change who we are as a christian because we fail because he's already taken care of the work he comes not to make us feel like we're not even saved he comes to help us to understand where our hope is where our help comes from where our strength is i want to tell you today no matter where you are there's nothing that you are struggling with in this hour that the wonderful spirit of god can't give you help and grace to overcome but you've got to lean on the advocate you've got to lean on the comforter and if you don't have him living on the inside of you by the baptism of the holy ghost you're missing out if he's not on board how many of you are glad you know that the holy ghost is on board he's on board he goes with me he keeps me boy when i think something when something comes into my mind that ought not to be there some some i don't know what you'd say something that i know that is not of him something that i know is not what i want to be and what he would have me to be that old enemy he will start screaming and if you listen to him you won't be listening to the holy spirit you'll be listening to the black dog remember what brother branham told us about the two dogs the indian story whichever one you feed the most is the one that's going to bark the loudest you're going to hear from him the most and every man has that struggle going on even the the great apostle paul in my innermost being there's a warfare going on when i try to do good it seems like evil is present that's the key that's the key the word as it has been revealed to us in this hour is to set us free from the guilt and the condemnation that comes with failure it is to give us a sense of maturity and to help us to understand when we fall we get back up when we fail the lord we repent have mercy on me lord give me strength and grace to never do it again but we don't lay out a church because we failed and we don't think we have to go back and be saved all over again because we failed i want you to know calvary has finished the work in my life i just have to recognize which voice i'm listening to why you know that old enemy he'll come like job's wife he'll say you ought to just curse god and die you look this precious family has gone through a tragedy since we saw them last there was a terrible accident on an icy road and a little twin grandbaby was lost that little mother that whole family of course they have grieved and of course they feel the loss but they have come to a place like you and i have to come we have to come to a place and say the lord does not make mistakes it's a big statement he doesn't make mistakes if god allows something to come into our life it comes for a purpose it comes for a reason and even though it tears our heart and it even tears our flesh and it tears our emotions our response has to be in this hour blessed be the name of the lord the lord gives and the lord takes away blessed be the name of the lord i don't mean to keep referring to this little group but brother greeley told you they lost their leader who had the vision for the group who had been such a tremendous blessing in their lives and he was sick and i know they must have believed god right to the end that he would be restored and receive a miracle he did get a miracle he was restored he now has a brand new body he now walks in a brand new life he has now reached a goal i want you to know that all of us are working toward but it doesn't it doesn't always take the pain and the loss and the grief that we go through there are things that we don't understand but we know that god sees what we cannot see he hears and and perceives things that we cannot and we just keep pressing toward that work pressing toward that mark and allowing the holy ghost to bring comfort to our heart to to show us the way to help us not to cling to one another but to cling to him now we will cling to one another as we cling to him but i want you to know that cannot be our strength it can't be found in one another because you may be taken from me i may be taken from you but there's one who's going to walk with you all the way to the end god didn't want to just walk beside you he wanted to live inside you don't you miss your opportunity to have the god of all eternity living inside of you by the baptism of the holy ghost are you with me now the scripture said here in verse 8 when the holy ghost comes when this comforter comes he's going to reprove the world of sin because they believe not on me [Music] the work of the holy ghost in in this aspect or this dimension is to help us to understand that unbelief is the foundation of sin unbelief is the source of sinfulness and if we don't deal with unbelief we will die in our sin unbelief ultimately has to be conquered or we will die in our sin do you believe that to be the truth could we share a little quotation from the message thou knowest all things hammond indiana he said now we know drinking and carrying on is sin but the whole thing is because of unbelief he said because if you believe god and jesus christ to be his son you are absolutely not going to do those things how many of you can understand that he said you believe that he's that born he that's born of god does not commit sin see all right he said you must believe i like this next phrase he said the whole thing lays in faith we cannot underestimate the power of faith in our life faith is where it's laying he said jesus said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life shall not come into condemnation but has already passed from death into life did you hear the word already that was the words of jesus he said do you believe that's the truth he said there it lays there isn't nothing else that you can do only believe my the church has made it complicated the church has made it so complicated jesus simplifies it all the prophet wanted to make it simple for us he said it all boils down to this only believe that's where faith works he said and if you believe then them little immoral things do we need to name them he said drinking and carrying on that's not all that's immoral we're living in an hour as we were praying last night this came to my mind we're living in an hour where we can we carry anything and everything in the palm of our hand anything and everything in the palm of our hand it's much good and much much evil and i want you to know don't you think that you or yours will be immune to the pull of the world to the pull of the enemy but when we can only believe when we can access the goodness of god by faith and understand the work that is being accomplished in us by the working of the holy ghost when we can do that then brother branham said all these little immoral things they start falling off i want you to hear him describe it he said they start falling off they drop off like that as you believe listen to this as you believe you become love as you believe you become love and love is god and you begin to wind yourself into christ and these other things you don't have to quit doing them did you hear it you don't have to quit doing them they quit themselves i wonder if anybody believes that if you've ever had the genuine baptism of the holy ghost you'll believe that because he will so change your desire he will so change the things you love the old timers used to testify that which i hated i now love that which i that which i used to love i now hate it's a complete turnaround the things i used to enjoy i hate them now the things i used to hate i love them now who did that it wasn't just making up your mind it was the ministry of the holy spirit in your life he said they just quit themselves there's just no desire to do it i've told you many many times about my own mother who tried to quit she tried to quit smoking she had smoked all of her life she tried to quit she'd do real good for a while and then she would smoke double for a while she would then quit again and then she would catch up all that she lost she just seemed to not be able to do it so she just finally said you have to die with something i know it's killing me but you have to die with something and she said i like them and i'm just not going to quit well i knew that wasn't right i knew that wasn't god i knew that wasn't really her i knew that was the devil talking to her but i want you to know one day the spirit of god came in the automobile when she was driving across the bridge on the way to work the presence of god came in the automobile in such a powerful way as an answer to my prayers and many others who had prayed for her and the thought dropped down in her heart she rolled the window down she threw the cigarette out over the edge of the bridge and she said lord if you'll save me if you'll fill me i'll never smoke again you say how in the world is that possible someone who had tried and tried and tried there's the key she tried on her own power she tried on her own strength if you're trying to please god by your own strength you're just striving and striving will lead to torment but if you're allowing the holy ghost in you to live this life if you're allowing the holy ghost in you to cause you to drop off the things that need to be dropped off then i want you to know you won't find it a struggle you'll find it a joy she said i don't want him anymore the desire is gone she grew up in an atmosphere uh in church because of the things that we were taught we were told you don't pray for god to take those things because they're filthy and he didn't give them to you so she wasn't praying that way she was just trying to do it by herself but when she surrendered and how did it happen in a supernatural way the presence of god just came into the automobile let me tell you something he'll come to you he'll come to you i'm not going to ask you how many of you have something in your life that you'd like to be finished with but i'm sure there are many of us who have something in our life we'd like to be finished with and we strive to get rid of it on our own and strive not to ever do such a thing or think such a thing again and i want you to know all the help we need is in us if we receive the holy ghost you know they used to teach you've got to get right before you can receive the holy ghost if that were the truth of the bible that it absolutely defeats the purpose of the holy ghost coming he comes to help you he comes to be your advocate he comes to be your help he comes to be your strength he said you don't have to quit doing them they just quit themselves there's just no desire to do it the worshiper having purged has no more conscience or desire of sin hebrews 9 he said when the worshiper is purged it's when he's born again when the old nature dies and a new nature sets in then he becomes a part of god a son of god do you believe that he gets new life and and he said the greek word there is zoe which means the life of god and you become an offspring of god and god can't hurt you without hurting himself see what i mean i tell you that's a word that's a word that's how god looks at you that's how he looks at you he doesn't want to bring you harm he doesn't delight in allowing difficulty in your life because you're a part of him if it hurts you it hurts him but he also understands that there's a greater glory that's being worked in us there's something being changed on the inside of the inside can i give you another one here letting off the pressure he said now you say brother adam i don't smoke or drink or chew or commit adultery he said that ain't it he said that's not sin that's the attributes of sin that's the attribute of unbelief see he said see if you believed you wouldn't do that he said no that's not that ain't what sin is unbelief is sin he that believeth not is condemned already that's just an attribute of unbelief he said but if you can't beat all that away from you say lord god i believe now here's good advice church if you can't just beat it back if you can't just push it out of your life on your own strength the prophet realized there's a struggle just like the writers of the new testament understood that there's a struggle he said then just say lord god i believe exactly what your word said and i believe as we preached last night that the appearing of the lord comes before the coming of the lord how many of you understand he appears before he comes he has appeared the lord has appeared he has appeared in the fullness of his word but he is coming the appearance doesn't replace the coming the appearance or the appearing foreruns the coming he's coming he has come he is coming now that's good to know he said you just say lord i believe and you hold on to that he said for it's just two different words altogether now the appearing as he promised in the last days that he'd be with us i like this he said and what a refuge what a consolation it is christians that we can stand here tonight in the presence of god in the face of his word and in the um and the impossibility that he promised in here we can see manifested right before us what a wonderful thing he said if that isn't a refuge if that isn't a haven of rest then i don't know what would be to see jesus who said the works that i do shall you do also oh what a promise that is now how many believe that that's the truth all right and then he goes into prayer so the prophet was telling us that instead of trying to start by dealing with all of the little attributes of sin you'll get caught up in the struggle you'll get caught up in the striving you'll get caught up listening to the voice of the accuser instead of doing all of that you need to go to the root of all the attributes of sin that's the work of the holy spirit he comes to reprove the world of sin to convince the world that there's a higher way than living in unbelief how many of you believe how many of you believe that your sin debt is taken care of by the blood of the lamb how many of you believe that do you really believe it do you really believe it to the point of no longer struggling with the reality of it you may feel the mental oppression you may feel the mental battle but the word says the prophet was teaching us here if you're just still trying to beat that stuff away on your own accord i'll never think that again i'll never think that again i'll never think that again and you're trying to do it by yourself you'll wear yourself out how many of you know by experience because you've tried it that way you'll wear yourself out but if you'll surrender to what you have already testified of receiving the baptism the life of god the holy ghost the zoe life of god living inside of the believer if we surrender to that we don't have to do the beating anymore we just say lord i believe i'm trying to get get these things taken care of i'm trying but but there's something i need your help lord i'm just going to tell you i believe your word i believe that you died for me i believe that you paid a price with your own blood i'm not a doubter i believe if you feel unbelief creeping in you just change your prayer just a tad you just say lord i believe help bow my unbelief i'm struggling with that but i know that there's a belief in me listen i've been studying some things that brother branham preached about the difference between faith in god and the faith of god it's powerful it's powerful we may not realize there's a complete difference but he said it's a different dimension he said having faith in god and having the faith of god is another dimension now i want to be right in the middle of a bride that starts operating in the faith of god because faith in god gets shaky sometimes based on circumstances but he fills you with the faith of god and there's no room for doubt there's only room for reality because the faith of god will always take a hold of the promise it'll never fall short in reaching for the promise your faith may miss but the faith of god in you will never miss oh lord fill us fill us with that faith with that faith i want to read another and then i'm going on i still have a little time i'm going to thank you for that in a message called planting the vine and where to plant it this may be a little obscure this message but it's powerful 1959 planting the vine and where to plant it paragraph 59 he said people don't believe in shouting did you know there's people that don't believe in shouting when i say that i can just hear the old timers they used to say if you don't like shouting don't get on my cloud because on my cloud i'm going to shout and praise god and worship god all the way through he said now people don't believe in shouting he said the thing of it is they haven't got spiritual joy no wonder some of you look so sour i love you but some of you look mighty sour it's a good thing the camera's not two ways here i can't see what they look like out there i can only see what you look like in here i'm sure there are many of us who can really look sour this is not the atmosphere to look sour in is it he said the thing of it is they've got no spiritual joy i want you to know i want to testify today i don't want to brag but i want to testify today god has filled me with spiritual joy i have joy that i don't understand i have joy that i don't deserve i have joy that doesn't run congruent with my circumstances because sometimes i don't have any reason to feel that joy you know why i can say that i have been filled with this kind of joy because i'm determined to have it i read that it's part of my inheritance and i find that all i have to do to come back to joy is worship him that's all i have to do is worship him i want to say that again when circumstances knock me out of joy when my when my frustration gets out of hand like benjamin's song he sings when when when troubles overwhelm me i know a key that is worth passing on if i can stop what i'm doing and stop what i'm thinking and make up my mind how good he is oh how good you are how good you've been to me lord how faithful you have been you have seen me through again and again and again and again and again i want to praise you because of who you are whoo as a parent hello as a parent it's easy to get knocked out of joy just being honest you better know what you're getting into don't have a baby just because you can you better know what you're agreeing to you better know you can see it all the way through amen because it doesn't end in the diapers when the diapers in the parenting is just getting started let me tell you something the the teenage years and the early 20 years if they're still at home that's when the real parenting has to kick in amen i'm blessed i'm not complaining i'm not complaining at all i'm blessed when i get prayer requests from around the world i know how blessed i am when people reach out to tell me what's going on in their home and in their family i know how blessed i am when i have believers of this message reach out to me and tell me that their 21 year old son just decked his dad i know how blessed i am come on now because that's just not going to happen where i live that's just not the way the order is supposed to be but when you're dealing with the problems of life because the bigger they get the bigger problems they can have and when love interests start getting involved oh my that's where you really start finding that it's easy to get out of joy your heart gets a little broke and you see them walking through something and you want them to know that they know that they know that they know that they know and you can easily get in a tither and you could easily stay up all night not praying but worrying but i want you to know what i have found out all i have to do is throw my hands up get where i can and if i can't get somewhere just do it where i am throw up my hands and say lord you have never failed me i want to thank you because you're god's sovereign you are god's supreme you are god holy you sit above it all you are master and lord of every situation you have promised me my family you have promised me my children you have promised me that they were going to become lord you have said i want to put my i tell you i can't help it i can't help it it doesn't matter how black it is how dark it is how serious it is there's a joy that starts rolling over in the depth of my spirit hallelujah i sometimes have to jump i sometimes have to dance somebody said oh there's nothing in there oh that's just emotion let me tell you something yours may be emotion but i have found something that's deeper than an emotion i have a river gets in my belly isn't that what he promised didn't jesus say out of men's bellies will flow rivers of living water and you can't have a river in your belly and not have some joy to go with it there's a joy thief that wants to steal your joy there's a circumstance that he will send your way there's an accusation that he will raise against you because he wants to steal your joy you've got to tell him no more the joy of the lord is not my feeling the joy of the lord is not my emotion the joy of the lord is my strength it's how i can fight it's how i can press it's how i can go on and all i have to do i'm telling you the truth all i have to do to come back to joy is take just a moment to worship him praise him you're never i'll tell you what may god give me the strength to be able to raise up my hands the longest day i live on the earth i don't ever want to be stoved up in such a way that i can't raise up my hands i know my heart would praise him anyway i know my spirit would praise him anyway but i want to be able to lift up my hands over my head and tell god i realize i live and breathe and move because of who you are it is not because of who i am that i get by it is because of who you are and you start doing that a little while i want to know does anybody else believe that has helped you is that a key in your life well those of you that don't think that's a key in your life maybe it's because you don't try it well i just can't hardly do some such a thing as that that's just not my nature nobody is talking to you about your nature your nature is what needs to die we're talking to you about a way to get out of the grubs we're talking to you about a way to get out of depression about a way to get out of condemnation about a way to get out from under the enemy's accusation about a way to deal with frustration is praise the lord praise the lord with a loud voice somebody said i don't have one use the one you got and praise him let everything that hath breath praise the lord praise him i don't believe in the drums i don't care what you believe in david believed in the drums david said praise the lord on the high sounding symbols he said praise him with sultry and harp he said praise him in the dance what about that somebody said if you believe the real message of the hour you'd put all that away you are way too late to tell me that i don't have a right and a reason and a compelling uh unction to give god praise amen i don't believe in all that twirling around and moving around and moving your body well listen you don't have to believe in it but i want you to know the bible said that's the way we come in praise we stand to praise we we lay prostrate on the floor to praise the bible tells us how to praise and how god looks at praise and i know that praise will bring the joy back he said people don't believe in shouting the thing of it is they don't have any spiritual joy and the joys of the waters of life can flow through we need that he said there's a whole lot is the matter that's a whole lot is the matter with the branham tabernacle because that unbelief the cares of the world had bound the people until it cannot produce spiritual growth it wouldn't be right for me to quote that about another church [Music] and not quoted about my own so there's a whole lot wrong with the new hope revival ministries and it's because of unbelief the cares of the world has bound the people until it cannot produce spiritual growth somebody said you're not going to whip us this morning are you no no no i'm just going to tell you we can't delight in somebody else's shortcoming and not recognize the fact we can easily get in the very same spot you can lose your joy the enemy is after your joy he's after your liberty and your freedom to praise god so you've got to make he said that's what's the matter with our nation we ought to listen to a voice like this he said that's what's the matter with our nation that's the matter with our churches he said they have no joy and the joy of the lord has departed come back joy of the lord come back freedom come back liberty that's what the holy ghost will bring when he comes i'm not talking about foolishness i'm talking about true dedicated worship and praise he said as was written once in the scripture the hebrew word ichabod which means the presence of the glory of the lord hath departed he said that's over our churches because we've left off the original foundation and placed ourselves into creeds and denomination and permitted the things of the world to dry up we've permitted the things of the world to dry up our experience with god help us lord would you help me say it help us lord this is not who we want to be we want to have it now the little second portion of this the bible said he would come and reprove the world of righteousness of sin of unbelief he would help the people to see your living and unbelief and you don't have to live in unbelief you can live in faith that's the work of the holy spirit people will go right on in their life doing what they want to do living the life they want to live until the holy spirit starts dealing with them that's how you came to him that's how you came to him he started knocking on your door he started tugging at your heart letting you know you're without god the reason why you feel the way you do is there's a higher way you're being called to live something else you you've got sin in your life you've got unbelief in your heart and god starts dealing with us that way and i thank him that he does but then he said when when he comes he will reprove which is to convict and convince he will reprove the world of righteousness he said of righteousness because i go to my father and you see me no more well you know that's an odd odd statement by our lord you look at that word righteous it it just simply means upright you get turned upside down in your own ways god wants to come and set you right back up upright again it means uh an acceptable condition before god of integrity and virtue and purity of life it means rightness it means correctness of thinking it means correctness of feeling it means correctness of acting meaning how we behave and yet isaiah 64 6 says but we are all as an unclean thing and all our righteousness or all of our righteousnesses are as filthy rags and we do all fade as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away what do you do when the god you want to please looks at you and says all of your righteousnesses are just dirty rags you mean i'm trying to please you and yet all my everything i do all my efforts appear before your holiness as just dirty rags and god says yes well that could be a little depressing that could be a little discouraging until we receive the revelation that it is not our righteousness that he is after come on if you can wake up just a few more minutes please do because it's very very liberating to find out that when you do the best you can do i think about so many different faiths i think about those who live the plain life it came up in the prayer last night when the spirit of the lord was leading our prayer benjamin mentioned it to me this morning when we got here he said that i can't help but think about the fact that as you were praying last night there are so many around the world in many in other faiths many faiths not just one or two movements who do all they can to be right right down to the window shade to be right and at the end of all of that even living without an electric bulb or whatever else is required to be right we want to be right with our community we want to be right with our bishop our pastor we want to be right with god so we do everything that we know to do and everything we're told to do and everything we think we should do and at the end of that to be told you still don't know that you're saved when will i know when you die then you'll know there is something in me that screams when i think of that there's something in me that says no that could not be the will of god it could not be the word of god it could not be the will of god for man to do all that he knows to do and still not have assurance that he's been born again it just could not be right so we pray for those who may be under such an idea that they would call on the lord for themselves that he would reveal himself as he has to some of those we know made himself real by putting a hunger in their heart that's how he does it it's a work of the holy spirit it's the work of the holy spirit before you're even baptized with the holy spirit he's still working for you as a child of god and he was working in my life before i surrendered he was working in your life before you surrendered that's why you surrendered because you thought you were seeking him and re in reality he was seeking you hallelujah and he draws and he deals and as the prophet said from the scripture of the devil's calling to the deep and it proves when that deeb is calling there's a deep down in you that must respond jesus doesn't want you doubting and not sure he wants to give you an assurance and the way we find that is when we recognize that on our best day i have a good day every now and again and on my best day when i do it all just right if i could hear god he would have to be true to his word and he would have to say all of that it's just filthy rags in the sight of my holiness because without my righteousness you are forever lost i tell you that makes me want to run because he he not only has required a righteousness from us but he has provided to us the righteousness that he has required i like the way brother branham talked about this in in he uses this scripture in matthew 3. let's look at it just a moment and i will hurry along matthew 3 13 then cometh jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptized of him but john forbade him may remember there were cousins saying oh i have need to be baptized of thee and cometh thou to me can you see the scene jesus comes walking up to where john is baptizing and he said i need to be baptized i need you to baptize me john is just blown away no i don't think i don't think you need me to baptize you i think i need you to baptize me and jesus said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him that's a powerful phrase the prophet preached a whole sermon with the title it's a powerful concept for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness the prophet says some things here that are very interesting because he speaks of the need of jesus christ to be baptized with the holy ghost so i mean he said i just don't understand that he was the spirit of god but there was a requirement a righteous requirement that had to be met the sacrifice had to be washed the sacrifice had to be washed and that day the sacrifice would not be a lamb it wouldn't be a bullock it wouldn't be a turtle dove that day there would be an ultimate sacrifice made at calvary one of the lamb of god that john identified by revelation is the one that cometh to take away the sins of the world here stood the lamb can't you hear john cry behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sins of the world that lamb was going to be a sacrifice and when he would become that sacrifice it would finish the need it would finish the requirement for sacrifice because he would become the sacrifice and in order to go to to death and shed blood and be the sacrifice that the eternal spirit of the father desired for him to be he had to fulfill the requirement of every other sacrifice that had been offered as an offering unto the lord in the holy temple in the tabernacle all through god's economy with man and that was he had to be washed so jesus is saying to john it behooves us both we must fulfill all righteousness i am here because we are fulfilling the righteous requirement of the eternal spirit of god if you are not doing your part and i'm not doing my part then we're not fulfilling everything that is required and so not only did he have to be washed in water but he also needed to be filled to be baptized brother said with the holy ghost just like every other believer because though he were a son yet he learned all things he learned everything by what he suffered and though he had started the adoption process on the mount of transfiguration when the voice said this is my beloved son it was not until he had gone we know that he had to have both he had to have both the voice in the in the river and he had to have both also the voice on the mount of transfiguration at the baptism this is my beloved son in whom i am pleased to dwell is that right and on the mount of transfiguration this is my beloved son here ye him that was the adoption so even our lord had to fulfill each and every part now i want to read this to you if you'll let me if you can stay awake long enough it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness 1961. this is so precious for me he said see aaron the high priest before he could ever be anointed he had to be washed for water therefore when jesus before he could be anointed our high priest he was washed with water and then that anointing oil poured upon him to anoint him like aaron was anointed with oil he was anointed with the holy ghost for john bare record seeing the spirit of god descending like a dove and going unto him or upon him and a voice saying this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell in so the bible said that jesus was anointed with the holy ghost went about doing good things see he was anointed he was the anointing in a body of flesh and yet he had to be anointed to do the work of the father so even though you have the holy ghost in you as a believer you still have to function under the unction of the anointing of the holy ghost to be successful in doing the work of god so even though he's in us we still have to have fresh fresh oil fresh oil i like it pour it on my head lord do it pour it on me verse 9 of paragraph 90 and before he was anointed he had to fulfill all righteousness he had to be washed with water before the anointing could come upon him it's a very beautiful type of us today as priest unto god we must be first baptized confess our sins be baptized in the name of jesus christ washing away our sins and then you shall receive the anointing the gift of the holy ghost see washed first and then anointed for service i'm going to skip down just a bit he said that's where the holy ghost fell and anointed first so a minister or any believer must first be washed from his sins in the name of jesus christ and then anointed with the holy ghost to bring forth a testimony for god how many of you want it both you want to be filled with the holy ghost and you want to be anointed by the power and unction of the holy ghost one more quotation here elisha the prophet 56. i know this is a lot of reading but i can't help it i can't help myself it's rich to me he said now a double portion of elijah's spirit came on elisha and he done twice the miracles that elijah did and a double portion of the holy spirit now i want you to notice elijah had a robe as a symbol he's talking about the mantle he said a robe was what he was wrapped in and it was a symbol of the holy spirit and he went up he watched and the robe fell back from the chariot remember the story in kings he picked up the robe he laid it on his own shoulders he went down to jordan and started doing the miracles and jesus the baptism that he had was the baptism of the holy spirit which was in him that came on him at the river jordan after he was baptized in water do you understand that even our lord jesus christ word in flesh even his own mother chosen of god highly favored of god to carry and yet they both had to receive the baptism of the holy ghost so please don't tell me just just nudge your neighbor just a minute let them wake up if you hear them snoring especially please don't tell me that we have come to a place now where we don't need the baptism of the holy ghost please don't try to say something like that we need him i need him i need him i want you to say with me i need him and not only do i need the baptism of the holy ghost i need that fresh oil to be poured over my head and again if you want an anointing over your life there's one way to create an atmosphere for that anointing to fall on you and that is with your praise i want you to know it's important it's not just setting the mood for the preaching it's creating an atmosphere for oil to fall on your head lord i ask you right now in the mighty name of jesus said before we leave this place you will let fresh oil fall on our heads he will because we believe him to do so we believe him for an anointing he said and that baptism was of the holy spirit which was in him that come on him at the river jordan after he was baptized in water john bare records seeing the spirit of god like a dove coming upon him and notice then when he went up he sent back the same robe mantle that he was wrapped in the holy ghost upon the church he said and now people that believe in the baptism of the holy spirit they're afraid to take divine healing he said afraid to declare yourself a member or an associate among these believers why you should be ashamed he said to be the greatest honor to know that i have been wrapped in the righteousness of the lord jesus christ and he seemed fit to do that for me [Music] lord i don't mind you telling me that all my righteousness is just filthy rags when you are offering to wrap me in the robe of your righteousness hallelujah your uprightness your ability to think right speak right and do right that's his ability and he wants to wrap you in that oh hallelujah he wants to wrap us in his righteousness whoo okay i'm not offended by him telling me that mine is not enough as long as he's making a way for me to have what is enough second corinthians 5 21 let's put that up on the board ii corinthians 5 21 for he hath made him father hath made son to be sin for us ii corinthians 5 verse 21 for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin the son word in flesh that we might be made the righteousness of god in him that word made here is a powerful word do you know what it means in in the original it means to be married to when i think of the word made i think of you know something you made something you crafted with your own hands but the real meaning of this word that's translated in english you're made is to be married to and he hath married him to sin for us the father hath joined him remember he had no sin of his own and yet all my sin was put on him and he was made fashioned married to joined to all of our sin all of our sin he bore it all all of our sin had to fall on the lamb it all had to be placed on the head of the lamb every bit of it had to be on him that we might be made married to the righteousness of god in him hallelujah did you know that god has married you to his righteousness when he sees you he sees his righteousness when he sees you he sees the blood that's why you must walk in the spirit you must choose every day of your life to walk in the spirit because if you're not walking in the spirit you will not enjoy the benefits of the spirit life and one of the benefits of the spirit life is to be wrapped in the righteousness of god i tell you that'll deal with the devil for you you just go meet the devil wrapped in the righteousness of god the accuser will have little to say to you if you are always wrapped up in the righteousness of god in him i'm happy i'm happy look at titus 3 5. not by works of righteousness which we have done i'll give them just a minute pardon me titus 3 5. not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us do you know why mercy was required do you know why he saved us because of mercy do you know what role mercy played in our salvation there was a righteous judgment that had to be met and mercy stood between us and the grace of god mercy bridged the gap we didn't get what we deserved mercy stepped in to make sure that we didn't receive the penalty that we had earned which was death and eternal separation from god mercy was a bridge it built a bridge between what god required and what we could offer mercy become the bridge so that grace could reach us grace became the vehicle to bring us the blood so we needed both mercy and grace to come to salvation and yet mercy and grace could not pay the ultimate price it could only make available to us what we needed it could bring us to the place of being accepted but a price had to be paid and how many of you know what the price was the price was not mercy the price was not grace the price was the blood so when you hear the prophet say you're not saved by the blood you're saved by grace please understand what he was teaching us in the scripture grace without the blood is not enough the blood without grace to get it to us is not enough so mercy is what came and bridged the gap so that we could receive grace and grace is what delivered the blood to us i'm so thankful i'm so thankful i'm so thankful i'm so thankful not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us look at the rest of this verse by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost that word regeneration speaks of the new birth it speaks of renewal it speaks of recreation it speaks of a total renovation and that word renewing speaks of a complete change for the better when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost i'm telling you right now you receive a complete change for the better you can't please god without the baptism of the holy ghost now that's a hard statement because your new birth is not complete until life comes not your natural born life but his life zoe life the life of god the life of christ how many of you are glad you know who you are and one more verse of scripture ephesians 2 11 lest someone would hear this and say you spent more time quoting brother branham than you did reading the scripture oh i got lots of scripture to read ephesians 2 11 in whom also in whom also we have obtained an inheritance hallelujah my name was in the will and i have received an inheritance being pre-destinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council i'm reading ephesians 2 11. i did i'm can i have 111 quit grinning she's grinning cause it's on me this time forgive me maybe we ought to read 2 11 too we can make it spiritual but no 111 i'm so sorry in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will do you know what part of that inheritance is his righteousness i have his righteousness as part of my inheritance in him how did i get an inheritance because my name was in the will how did that will get to be a part of my life the testator had to die hallelujah he had to die and when he died everything that was a part of him it was then made available his whole estate became available to the believer didn't the prophet tell us all that was in the father he poured into the sun and all that was in the sun he poured into the church on the day of pentecost by the power of the holy ghost we have an inheritance that moths cannot corrupt and thieves cannot break through and steal floods can't drown it and fires can't burn it it is an eternal inheritance we didn't earn it we just accepted it and how did we accept it with a carnal understanding no by faith by faith did you hear my amen in me by faith he said no it's by faith thank you lord somebody said i don't have faith you do you were given a measure of faith when you come here and if you use what faith you have your faith will grow and you won't have any problem walking up and saying i have an inheritance coming now i know that there are many who are taught that that kind of assurance is pride i want you to know it is not pride to take god at his word it's pride to think you can earn it it's pride for a woman to think she could earn it by by making her skirt even longer or making this or that or the other you can't earn it that way even modesty is a requirement for a new testament believer but it is not how we become righteous i'm going to tell you something i believe attendance in in meetings meeting the saints and coming together i believe it's essential but that's not where our righteousness lays i believe in paying tithe i know there's a lot of people who believe that it seems to be such an old testament concept that they don't want any part of giving what belongs to god to god and i say that's okay let's do it the new testament way if you want to if you want to argue about giving god a tenth of your what he puts in your hands then let's do it like they did in the book of acts where they sold everything they had and brought it all and laid it at the apostles feet so it's 10 or 100 percent i think most people would rather come and bring god whatever they can give him oh it's quiet i wasn't taking an offering i'm just telling you don't you don't you argue and grumble over something like that be thankful that you have an opportunity to sow a seed for the work of the lord to go on somebody out there's got to hear what you know you know something that somebody's got to hear and you've got to help get it to him i'll tell you he told us the greatest commission is to go if you can't go send somebody and did you know you're doing that i'm not trying to be cheesy did you know you're doing that right now you're sending somebody you're pulling in this service and an amen that you can squeeze out and keeping your mind here and helping an anointing to continue to flow you're helping to reach somebody who needs to be reached in that message who is this melchizedek brother branham calls righteousness because remember he said he was a dual king he was both the king of peace and the king of righteousness and he talks talks about righteousness there and he calls it the spirit attribute he said righteousness is the spirit attribute it's not man's attribute it's not the believer's attribute it's what happens when the spirit comes he brings the righteousness of god romans 1 17 for therein is the righteousness of god revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith isaiah 61 and 10 i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decath himself with ornaments and as a bride adorneth herself with jewels can you say amen ephesians 4 24 you wanted scripture ephesians 4 24 and that you put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness it is a gift another little piece from the church ages he's quoting ephesians 4 24 that i just read he said it and that you put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness listen to this the new creation you are now a new creation do you understand that how many of you understand if you know you're a new creation i want to see your hand you know what new means it means new it means new when brother branham talks about the redeem being a race a chosen race of people he wasn't using that word wrong he used that word right he was telling us that we are recreated there's only a small representation of what we have been that remains in us because we are not maybe the natural born seed of abraham but by the new birth we are the royal sea of abraham if you're with me then you can say amen and so he goes on to describe this new creation that we are yeah i like this i like this this new creation is not the old creation made over brother richard ellsworth brother michael christian robert who else all of you every one of you i'm just calling names so you'll know i know your name every one of you you are not just a remodeled creation he didn't just send his blood and remodel you he said this new creation is not the old creation made over this isn't remodeling a home no no no he said or it could not be called a new creation this is exactly what it says it is new creation it is another creation distinct from the old one somebody said well what in the world does that mean it means that when you are born again of the spirit of christ you are not just an old sinner saved by grace are you really going to say that i just did there's some beautiful songs out there and i know even brother brandon makes statements like that beautiful songs and beautiful though i'm just a sinner say by grace it's beautiful the thought is amazing but it is not entirely congruent with scripture you're only describing one part of what god has done in your life because the bible said if you're born of god he that is born of god cannot does not commit sin so how is it that you are a sinner and saved by grace at the same time so if i'm going to sing it i'm going to sing i was a sinner but now i'm saved by grace because we understand that when we are born again of the spirit of christ we are not an old creation that's been remodeled an old man that has been made over but we now become a new creature a new creation a new man in jesus christ oh my oh my oh my old things are passed away all things have become new you are now manifesting who you were in the mind of god from before the foundations of the world this is a powerful this is a powerful demonstration of god's grace did you know that his righteousness around you like a cloak it already also becomes a part of your armor if you are wearing the righteousness of god if you have been wrapped in the righteousness of god if the holy spirit has convinced you of your need for the righteousness of god and you have surrendered to the work of the holy spirit in your life and you are now wearing that did you know it also becomes a breastplate the robe of righteousness also becomes a breastplate in the armor of the believer and when the enemy comes against you it's his righteousness that's protecting the most vulnerable parts of who you are your heart is vital got to have a heart you got to have a heart you got to have a blood pump something happens to that blood pump you're not living anymore i said to them the other night i i like to breathe i'm kind of fond of breathing i've got to have my lungs to breathe these are pretty vital organs wouldn't you say and when god was building that armor for the believer he decided that it was going to be righteousness that would become the breastplate that would protect the most vulnerable parts of who we are hallelujah and it's not your sweetheart i want you to know you're precious but that is not your righteousness that has become your breastplate if it is you're going to be in real trouble when the devil calls in the big guns when the enemy pulls in the big guns your righteousness will crumble and you'll tuck your tail and run like a little child i'm telling you right now but if you know that you know that you know that you know that you are prepared because you've been dressed in the armor of the lord and his righteousness has become your robe your cloak your anointing and it has also become your breastplate and you are fully persuaded when you meet the enemy you can stand toe to toe with the devil and any of a number of his imps and never have to bend never have to bow never have to bat an eye because you know that his righteousness is enough to meet every attack to meet every accusation can i say again the righteousness of jesus christ in your life by the work of the holy spirit is enough to meet every devil and every circumstance that tries to take you out and we're nearly done stand therefore ephesians 6 14 stand therefore having your loins gird about with truth you've got to have truth truth is a person god didn't send the revelation of this message to make us just doctrinally sound he sent this message to introduce us to jesus christ if we're holding on to brother branham and not holding on to jesus we've missed the message if we're depending on him to get us through i've got many precious friends out there who are waiting on him to return so he can help the bride get it over get over well i want you to know that's not the way it's going to work because that breaks the continuity of scripture you don't need brother branham to come and help you get ready he introduced you to jesus christ the same spirit that was in jesus christ is here to help you get over you didn't need jesus standing in a physical body to go through what they had to go through in the early church you just needed the same spirit that was in jesus to get inside of the believer and that's how they faced the enemy because they had the same spirit that raised jesus from the dead living inside of them don't get weird don't get strange you grab a hold of jesus with everything that you've got and you will not be offensive to the prophet if you should meet him one day in eternity you won't be offending him if you hold on to jesus he came like john the baptist to help introduce us to the one that would do something for us and john the baptist understood and received by revelation i must decrease so that he must increase he's got to get bigger and i got to get smaller so he can get bigger same way in your life you and i have to get smaller so jesus can get bigger in us we have to quit depending on our righteousness and start depending on him are you with me our loins gird about with truth having on the breastplate of righteousness romans 8 3 and 4 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh now let's have verse 4. romans 8 4 i want you to see it that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us how how do you know what the law requires the law requires a lot did you know you and i couldn't even fulfill all that is required in the law because there are no temple standing there's no sacrificial system in place there's quite a number of the of the over 600 commandments in the in the old testament that we would not be able to fulfill if we wanted to because the order is not in place to do so there are new testament christians believers who get so caught up in thinking that they have to to do everything just just like it was done and and guess what's so strange what's so what's so odd to me is they don't just go back to the scripture and try to do it according to the scripture they try to do it like modern judaism so they're they're doing so much depending on so much by the tradition of the rabbis by the tradition of the sages all these things are interesting but you've got i pray that you won't do it by the traditions because if you do it by the traditions of man you'll get drunk on purim because i've been standing in the old city of jerusalem and i have looked at the ultra-orthodox piled up like cordwood because it's purim time and it's the one day of the year they get so drunk that they don't know whether it's day or night it's the tradition to the fathers so if you and i were going to try to go back and meet god and try to figure it all out and then add to the scripture all the traditions of the rabbis and the jewish sages and those who have gone before us i want to tell you something you'd never feel like you'd done anything you'd never feel like you'd please god you'd get so confused you would get on the internet and you'd read this messianic and that messianic and the other messianic and you'd get so confused because they don't agree and i'm not saying that we shouldn't remember these things we should they're commandments there are things that should be remembered there are things that should be honored there are things that should be celebrated we're going to celebrate the feast of tabernacles all the way through the millennium there are certain things that god has has put in that word for us and we will participate and partake but i want you to know that if you kept every one of the commandments of the old testament kept them to the mark you would still fall short for the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit let's go back to verse 3 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit how is that possible because he lives in us his righteousness is covering us look at verse 10 of the same chapter we're nearly done i can see the end in sight romans 8 10 and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit of life because but the spirit is life let me read it again and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness whose yes are you willing to let the holy spirit dress you the same holy spirit that convicts and convinces you of sin so that you can repent the same holy spirit that convinces and convicts you of little things that creep up in your life that same holy spirit desires part of his work and ministry in the end time is to dress us in the righteousness of god are you are you willing to surrender and quit struggling and striving to try to do it yourself and let him come and do it through you somebody said i think that's risky i think that's risky because i think there's some things that can be missed i want you to know there's nothing that can be missed because everything that he requires he will provide if we yield to him does that mean we have no obligation it means we have many obligations and that is to approach him by faith to repent of our sins to heed the god to follow the leadership of the holy spirit but also to let him dress us in something that we cannot produce ourselves you cannot produce the righteousness that is required it's got to be his are you with me in the church ages one other little section here i might get in trouble using so much of the church age book this is from the ephesian church he said the true church of jesus christ the bride is likened to pure gold her righteousness you read it for me would you it's his righteousness the only way she can be righteous good enough is to have his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no faith no fault excuse me there is no fault in her quiet she is all glorious within and without from beginning to ending she is the work of her lord is that right and all his works are what you are his handiwork you are his craft he is making you he is molding you by the holy spirit into his image that's why you've got to have the holy ghost it's not enough to have him working from the outside in you've got to have him working from the inside out are you still here we have to close one scripture one more philippians 3 9 and be found in him paul saying to be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith the righteousness which is of god by faith we're holy because he made us holy we're accepted because he made us accepted in the beloved we're forgiven because he forgave us before we asked we had to ask because that's our deposit of faith we had to participate in our own process of redemption but we did that not with intellect we did that by faith we said lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe that i could never be right enough lord i believe i could never do it on my own but i know you've done it and so i accept that by faith that's powerful isn't it last the last one i'm not usually still preaching at two i'm usually we're usually praying by then but philippians 3 9 is is where i just read be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith and i want to read this one last little paragraph from satan's eden he said god's eden was established in righteousness satan's eden is established in sin because satan is sin do you know that's where we're living now we're living in satan's eden we're about to be delivered there's a deliverance coming out of satan's eden it may not be as soon as we would like but it's coming god's eden in the beginning was established in righteousness satan's eden is established in sin because satan is sin he said god is righteousness and god's kingdom was established in righteousness and peace and read it life and satan's establishment is in sin and religious sin let me tell you something you may be living in satan's eden but you're not of satan's eden you're of god's eden did you know you can live right here in the atmosphere of satan's eden and yet you are living in another kingdom altogether because you're living in in the kingdom of god in god's righteousness hallelujah no matter what's happening around would you stand i want to ask you for a little bit of mercy i i feel i feel i went way too long but would you stand with me right now and thank you thank you thank you so much musicians are coming thank you so much that you stayed with me as long as you did thank you thank you i hope you jotted the verses down the scriptures down i hope you'll read them again i hope you'll use them as ammunition against the enemy i know some of you have been waiting a long long time for the washroom and and i just thank you thank you thank you so much if we spend our life focusing on our unworthiness we'll miss his worthiness in us if we spend our life focusing on how we how far we come from measuring up we'll always walk in a bit of condemnation but if we'll just let him dress us holy spirit of god if we'll just let him dress us in his righteousness oh we thank you lord we thank you lord we thank you lord we thank you for your precious blood would you just give god some praise right now lord we thank you for your precious blood hallelujah we thank you for the way that you've made for us we thank you that the holy ghost he doesn't just come to make a shout he didn't just come to make us speak in tongues he didn't just come to make us do something like that with a sensation but thank you that he come to convince and to convict us of our unbelief thank you that he's come to dress us in the righteousness of god to show us that our righteousness would never measure up thank you that he has come to convince and to convict us of judgment to show us that the enemy who's loose now will not always be loosed he has an ultimate judgment coming he will one day uh cease to be we understand that from the word of god our enemy that torments us so now day and night one of these days will torment us no more and we will live and in eternal peace with you because you have made the way lord thank you for making the way come on church we're not leaving until we come back into an atmosphere for just a moment of praising him because he deserves all of our praise he deserves some worship before we go today just to say lord thank you for the working of the holy ghost in my life lord i realize there are some who may be watching some who may be standing here today who don't know for sure that they've received the baptism of the holy ghost i pray that a desperation would be stirred up in them even now i pray lord that there would be no satisfaction in their life they would have no real true rest until they have pressed their way in to the full baptism of the holy ghost we know that they have each one who has come to you through repentance and justification we have all been touched by the work of the holy spirit but our desire is more than just a touch our desire is to be baptized to be immersed to be totally filled up within and without of your good holy ghost hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah how good you are lord how good you are how faithful you have been somebody praise him with me how faithful you've been lord how true you are your word is life your word is truth your word is deliverance how we praise you how we praise you how we praise you there's enough of the holy ghost around us in our lives as well to give us this portion of satisfaction to say lord i know i know that i know that i know that you have claimed me as your own not for good that i have done but it is by your mercy by your grace by your blood hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord you have a song you could lead us in i want to worship him i want to give him

gather together to worship him lord i'm asking you to meet needs right now he became sin i'm asking you to meet him i'm asking you to pour oil on somebody's family his righteousness his righteousness

you you say i don't know what the need is no but he does he does he does lord i just want to i just want to join my faith right now with with christian's faith and and i just want to believe lord that whatever he has need of just a young man but a special young man and i've already discerned lord in these two days that your hand is on him and you have a purpose for his life and we see lord that the enemy wouldn't be pleased with that he's never pleased when the when the call of god falls on a believer he doesn't like that at all but i just thank you lord for this young man's faith i pray o god that he will press into you that he will have a personal relationship with you that no devil of hell would ever be able to talk him out of i pray that his faith would go down deep and that he would strike the rock i pray lord that his faith would strike the rock of ages and that he would not be tossed about he would not be pushed about or pulled about by the influences or pulls of this life but i pray o god that he would be firmly rooted and grounded in the truth of your word and that he would stand like a mighty bulwark against every attack of the enemy now lord i don't know why but i just sense that he has at times been a target and i'm asking you lord to strengthen him in the precious name of our lord jesus christ strengthen him stir in him a desire for your word stir in him a desire for prayer stir in him a desire to be even more dedicated i'm not even looking at his age i think his age is irrelevant i think your hand on him the call of god over his life is more important than his natural age or number i'm asking you lord to fill him with the holy ghost and fire sanctify him by the washing of the water of the word and may he pursue a relationship with you that is personal that is intimate that is real may he overcome may he overcome in all things for the glory of god for the glory of god hallelujah you're just praying for the one next to you right now before we leave
