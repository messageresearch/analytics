[0:00] the one who knows the most about you
[0:04] loves you the most and all he said is
[0:07] claim my blood take my word make up your
[0:12] mind to arise out of the depression and
[0:15] the prostration that your circumstances
[0:18] have kept you in arise and shine for the
[0:21] glory of the Lord has risen upon
[0:25] thee God still has an appointment in
[0:29] your life
[0:32] he doesn't see
[0:35] it he doesn't see it he chooses to see
[0:40] you through the
[0:44] blood does he know it sure he
[0:47] knows but it's not what he's looking at
[0:50] you can have everything you need
[0:53] sufficiently supplied for you in Christ
[0:57] he will give you your value
[1:01] once you take his yoke on you start
[1:04] learning who he is and who you are
[1:07] because you're in him and it satisfies
[1:11] the need for
[1:14] validation if you're not finding
[1:17] validation in Christ you need more of
[1:19] him and that's not a condemnation that's
[1:22] an invitation come get more of him come
[1:26] get more of him so that he's what you
[1:28] love who you love above all
[1:32] else there's nothing no thing no one
[1:36] that means as much to you as your daily
[1:39] communion and your daily relationship
[1:41] with Jesus Christ we've got to get that
[1:43] way people tell me through the years I
[1:46] need a little break from church no you
[1:49] don't need a break from
[1:52] church you need a break from
[1:55] you and you can't get out of you the
[1:58] only place that you can learn
[2:00] how is to get in his
[2:03] presence so that you can have some rest
[2:05] I mean rest I mean
[2:09] rest you see Sabbath is a whole lot more
[2:12] than 24 hours on a clock somewhere it's
[2:15] so much more it always
[2:17] was it was always pointing to someone
[2:21] yes sir not to
[2:26] something Jesus didn't think it was
[2:28] wrong to pluck Colonels and feed his
[2:31] disciples on the
[2:33] Sabbath he didn't think it was wrong to
[2:36] pull the ox out of the
[2:39] ditch it's more than a
[2:42] day it's it's a place of living and when
[2:45] you are yolked into Christ you can find
[2:47] Sabbath more than Friday night to
[2:49] Saturday night if that's the only time
[2:52] we had peace in our life and rest in our
[2:54] life we'd be in trouble wouldn't we how
[2:56] many of you are glad you know the master
[2:58] of Sab
[3:00] you know him he is our peace
