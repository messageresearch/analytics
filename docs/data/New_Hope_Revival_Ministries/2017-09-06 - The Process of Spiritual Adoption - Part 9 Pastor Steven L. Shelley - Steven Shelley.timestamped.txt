[0:50] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen
[0:53] Shelley and you're watching the Eagles
[0:55] cry I want to welcome you to the program
[0:58] today and remind you of what a great joy
[1:01] it is for us to be able to come to you
[1:03] week after week on this great gospel
[1:06] network and declare to you the Word of
[1:09] God
[1:10] sometimes we're teaching a little bit
[1:12] and other times we get a little excited
[1:14] and do a little preaching but I pray
[1:17] that something has been said that has
[1:20] encouraged you along the way and perhaps
[1:23] that's why you've tuned in again today
[1:24] if you have been watching the program
[1:28] and it has been a blessing to you why
[1:30] don't you consider sending us an email
[1:32] or making contact with our ministry here
[1:34] in Alabama in the United States of
[1:37] America and let us know that you have
[1:39] been blessed and that becomes a great
[1:41] encouragement to us to know that our
[1:44] labor in the Lord is not in vain and
[1:46] that something is being accomplished to
[1:48] help further the kingdom of the Lord
[1:50] Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah
[1:53] I appreciate the contact that we've had
[1:55] with many of you in the nations of the
[1:57] world and you have let us know that you
[1:59] have learned a lot from the program and
[2:02] it's always interesting for me to read
[2:05] the different principles the different
[2:08] things that minister to different people
[2:10] and in all the different places all
[2:14] across Europe and Scandinavia the Middle
[2:16] East and and through portions of Asia
[2:19] and wherever you're watching by the
[2:22] World Wide Web you may be watching this
[2:25] anywhere in the world or by podcasts
[2:27] it's just a great joy to know that there
[2:30] are so many of you out there that are
[2:32] hungry for more of the Word of God and
[2:36] that's why this particular series has
[2:39] been so special for me as we have been
[2:42] teaching now for quite a while on the
[2:45] process of spiritual adoption and we're
[2:48] gonna look at some more of that today
[2:50] and I trust that you'll be blessed and
[2:52] we'd like to pray with you about your
[2:54] prayer requests if you'll send them in
[2:55] then I promise to be faithful to help
[2:58] lift those needs up before the Lord
[3:01] and we'll just believe that God will
[3:03] answer prayer and that he'll give the
[3:05] increase and provide the miracle and
[3:07] then you'll want to send another email
[3:09] to let us know what the Lord has done
[3:11] amen
[3:12] so let's look to the Word of God today
[3:14] we were talking the last time we were
[3:16] together about three very important
[3:20] milestones I guess we could call them in
[3:22] the life of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ
[3:25] and how these three milestones speak of
[3:30] the process of growing of coming to
[3:33] maturity we believe that the universal
[3:36] call to the bride of Jesus Christ in
[3:39] this hour is to to come up higher as
[3:43] John heard it in Revelation chapter 4
[3:45] there is an open door there is an
[3:48] opportunity available there is an
[3:51] invitation that is being made in this
[3:54] hour for you and I to come to a place of
[3:57] greater stability a place of deeper
[4:01] intimacy and relationship and eventually
[4:05] come to a place of full adoption all of
[4:09] creation is groaning the scripture says
[4:12] for the manifestation the apocalypsis
[4:15] the unveiling of the sons of God the
[4:19] mature sons of God not the infants not
[4:23] those who are in adolescence or puberty
[4:26] only but those who have come all the way
[4:29] up to that Greek word Hill's thesis it
[4:33] talks about the placing of a mature son
[4:38] and I believe that this is the time for
[4:41] that I believe this is the spiritual
[4:43] season where many are going to begin to
[4:46] supersede where they have been in Christ
[4:49] and come into a deeper more fulfilling
[4:54] relationship with him we've talked about
[4:56] in this series already the inadequacy of
[5:00] religion religion is not adequate it's
[5:03] not enough to keep us pushing into
[5:06] Christ we need more than that we need
[5:10] relationship
[5:11] and we're even calling for the body of
[5:13] Christ to become more relational where
[5:15] we're believing that God wants to bring
[5:17] unity between brothers and sisters in
[5:21] Christ and we need to we're not talking
[5:25] about compromising with the Word of God
[5:27] the Word of God is right and it is yay
[5:30] and a man but we're talking about how so
[5:34] many times we have allowed the littlest
[5:36] of things to divide us to isolate us to
[5:39] keep us from growing together and I'm
[5:42] persuaded that we can learn from each
[5:44] other what God has deposited in your
[5:47] life may be exactly what somebody else
[5:50] is needing in this season and vice versa
[5:53] and so it is a body ministry and we need
[5:57] one another as we grow in the Grace and
[6:01] in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus
[6:03] Christ we know that this Christian
[6:06] journey is it has a beginning and then
[6:09] there is a process there is a a journey
[6:13] and then there is a time of celebration
[6:17] when when it is when it has to become
[6:21] evident when we have the evidence that
[6:25] we can prove who we are in Christ
[6:28] because we have stepped into a place of
[6:31] authority whereby we are able to work
[6:35] the works of God and I believe that
[6:38] that's where we're headed and I pray
[6:40] that you will dig in and that you will
[6:43] spend time before the Lord as he broods
[6:47] over you by the Holy Spirit changing you
[6:50] quickening you drawing you to himself so
[6:53] we talked about in the life of Jesus
[6:55] when he was 8 years old he was excuse me
[6:59] when he was 8 days old he was
[7:00] circumcised and then a few days after
[7:04] his mother had finished her time of
[7:07] purification the Bible said he was taken
[7:09] to the temple in jerusalem where Simeon
[7:12] and Anna I believe Simeon was prophetic
[7:16] and and of course the scripture says
[7:18] that Anna was a prophetess and these
[7:20] were
[7:22] some of those who had been looking for
[7:24] the salvation of Israel and then we
[7:27] talked about a time when Yeshua the Lord
[7:30] Jesus was 12 years old at Pesach time
[7:33] Passover his parents brought in back to
[7:36] the temple as they came every year but
[7:39] we find him now in the temple at 12
[7:42] years old and they they think that he's
[7:45] with them when they leave Jerusalem to
[7:47] go back to Nazareth but he has stayed
[7:49] behind and it's actually three days
[7:51] before they see him again
[7:52] he has been been spending his time in
[7:55] the temple both asking questions and
[7:58] teaching with the supernatural wisdom of
[8:02] God the scholars the rabbi's those who
[8:05] are learning and who were learning in
[8:07] the law and when he is questioned about
[8:10] his behavior why did you upset us this
[8:13] way and and stay behind and we didn't
[8:15] know it his response was don't you
[8:20] understand that I must be about my
[8:22] father's business and when we read that
[8:25] it reminds us that in that second temple
[8:28] period culture at the age of 12 years
[8:31] old a young man was accepted into the
[8:36] business of the family he became what we
[8:40] would call an apprentice and his father
[8:42] and others would take special time to
[8:46] train him and equip him so that
[8:48] eventually he would be able to take over
[8:50] the family business as we went off the
[8:52] air last week we talked about the fact
[8:54] that he would be even granted some
[8:56] authority in business
[8:58] his father would celebrate the fact that
[9:01] he was 12 years old and would speak to
[9:03] the merchants in the in the town and
[9:05] would let them know they're going to be
[9:07] times that my son will come to pick up
[9:10] supplies or to drop things off and I
[9:12] want you to treat him with the same
[9:13] respect that you would treat me with so
[9:16] it's it's just an interesting thing
[9:18] however at 12 years old that young man
[9:21] certainly didn't have the necessary
[9:24] maturity level to to conduct all of the
[9:27] business to make to make huge decisions
[9:30] no he would have to continue to grow up
[9:34] at the age of approximately thirty there
[9:37] would be another very important ceremony
[9:39] that would be a public declaration of
[9:42] his level of maturity that we'll talk
[9:46] about later in the Jewish faith a
[9:49] teenager is celebrated when they come to
[9:52] this place of maturity and
[9:54] accountability in either a bar mitzvah
[9:56] or a bat mitzvah depending on whether or
[9:59] not it's for a young man or for a young
[10:01] lady and so we can really say that
[10:04] Yeshua had what would be similar to a
[10:08] bar mitzvah a an experience of coming to
[10:13] this place where he was an apprentice of
[10:17] his father not Joseph only his earthly
[10:20] father the carpenter but he was in the
[10:23] temple conducting the business of his
[10:26] Heavenly Father I really love that I
[10:28] love reading it and being reminded of
[10:32] some of these interesting things in the
[10:35] life of the Messiah
[10:37] now that word that we've talked about
[10:39] and I I pronounced a little differently
[10:42] some time trying to get it off of my
[10:43] tongue but but it it comes from the word
[10:46] helos and and adding to that the word
[10:50] thesis and it means the placing of a
[10:54] mature son and this is referring to a
[10:58] time as we said a moment ago when around
[11:01] the age of 30 at this time the father of
[11:05] the young man would take him into a
[11:08] public forum usually at the gate of the
[11:12] city and he would lay his hand on the
[11:15] head of his son and openly proclaim this
[11:20] is my beloved son this is the son that I
[11:24] love and I am pleased with him and then
[11:28] he would go on to say one historian
[11:30] tells us he would go on to say I bestow
[11:33] upon him now all of my riches and power
[11:38] and authority and this was like what we
[11:42] would call the power of attorney a
[11:44] transfer of authority so that he might
[11:48] act on my behalf in all of my affairs
[11:52] now that certainly didn't happen at
[11:54] eight days old and that certainly didn't
[11:56] happen at 12 years old but approximately
[11:59] at the age of thirty what would be
[12:02] considered scripturally full adoption
[12:05] the the the season of placing the mature
[12:10] son in the position in which he was born
[12:13] four and that's what we're after in the
[12:16] body of Christ we understand that we
[12:19] have been spiritually circumcised the
[12:21] scripture speaks about the circumcision
[12:24] of the heart the cutting away of the old
[12:26] flesh the beginning of the process of
[12:29] new birth we have been sanctified by and
[12:33] cleansed by the washing of the water of
[12:35] the word we have received the baptism of
[12:37] the holy spirit I hope with the the
[12:41] manifestation of the gifts of the Spirit
[12:43] and and the evidence is that God is he
[12:46] is in us he testifies of those things by
[12:50] his Spirit but we're still learning and
[12:53] we're still growing and we know more as
[12:56] adults we understand more as adults than
[13:00] we did as teenagers and when we were
[13:02] teenagers we understood more than we did
[13:04] when we were toddlers and this is in the
[13:07] natural process of Aging but this is
[13:10] also in the spiritual process we grow in
[13:13] grace the Apostle said from faith to
[13:15] faith from strength to strength from
[13:18] glory to glory from from one place to
[13:22] the next place in Christ from one level
[13:25] of understanding to the next level of
[13:28] understanding even our wisdom increases
[13:32] specifically with age but but wisdom is
[13:35] a spiritual gift and you can be old and
[13:38] not wise and so it's not just wisdom
[13:42] that comes with years of experience but
[13:45] as men and women of God we want to have
[13:48] the supernatural manifestation of wisdom
[13:52] he is wisdom Jesus Yeshua is wisdom to
[13:57] have him means that we have a part of
[14:01] his wisdom and we want to yield to that
[14:04] and this word knowledge that we talk
[14:07] about we want more knowledge not a head
[14:10] knowledge but a heart knowledge a
[14:12] revelation of truth the knowledge of
[14:15] truth can sustain us only so far it can
[14:19] keep us for only so long but a
[14:22] revelation of truth is something that
[14:25] will sustain us and give us an anchor in
[14:30] all kinds of stormy weather we want that
[14:33] truth to drop from our head to our heart
[14:36] and I've been following the Lord a long
[14:38] time but I'm asking God every day for
[14:42] revelation knowledge for for revelation
[14:45] of his word and you've heard me say
[14:47] before you can read the Bible but it's
[14:50] not how much of God's Word you go
[14:52] through it's how much of God's Word goes
[14:54] through you how much of God's Word are
[14:57] you able to spiritually digest why is
[15:01] that important because it's only what we
[15:03] have understanding of that we are able
[15:06] to apply and to appropriate if you have
[15:10] no understanding of a particular
[15:12] spiritual truth then you cannot you
[15:15] cannot apply that truth in your personal
[15:18] life you can't appropriate or put in
[15:21] action that truth and neither can you
[15:24] impart it to others and that's part of
[15:27] what our calling is as mature sons of
[15:32] God we're coming to that place we're not
[15:35] boasting that we're there we're not
[15:37] saying already we've come to the full
[15:39] measure of adoption but we're saying
[15:41] we're going to keep pressing on we're
[15:44] going to like we say in the south of the
[15:46] United States we're going to keep on
[15:48] keeping on
[15:50] great man of God a prophet from the last
[15:52] generation William Branham said you have
[15:56] gone as far with God as you're ever
[15:58] gonna go until we're willing to pay a
[16:02] greater price and he said we need to
[16:04] keep our eyes on Calvary and keep
[16:07] pressing toward Jesus Christ and that's
[16:10] what we must do in this hour we must
[16:12] keep pressing in
[16:14] to Christ until we come to that place
[16:17] that the Apostle Paul was
[16:20] travailing in prayer in birthing prayer
[16:24] prayer that Christ be formed in us
[16:27] that's what we want the fullness of
[16:29] Christ to be formed in us to come to
[16:33] that place where we can be trusted of
[16:36] our Father with all of the riches of
[16:40] heaven the very divine nature of God all
[16:44] of the blessings and provision that
[16:47] heaven holds we want to be able to to
[16:51] appropriate that in the earth the power
[16:53] of the spoken word has been given to the
[16:57] body of Christ we want to know how to
[16:59] use that with wisdom we want we want God
[17:03] our Father to be able to trust us so
[17:05] that we can use that not for personal
[17:08] gain not for public show but everything
[17:12] we do we want to do it to further the
[17:16] kingdom of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ
[17:19] in the earth when we have been talking
[17:23] about adoption we started this series
[17:25] many weeks ago by reading the the five
[17:29] places in the New Testament where the
[17:32] word adoption is used and that's the
[17:34] word that means the placing of mature
[17:37] sons Romans 8:15 Romans 8:23 Romans nine
[17:44] three through five and maybe I'll read
[17:49] that I don't believe I read Romans nine
[17:51] maybe three through five four I would
[17:53] wish that myself were a curse from
[17:56] Christ for my brethren my kinsmen
[17:58] according to the flesh who are
[18:00] Israelites to whom pertaineth the
[18:03] adoption and the glory and the covenants
[18:07] and the giving of the law and the
[18:09] service of God and the promises whose
[18:12] are the fathers and of whom as
[18:14] concerning the flesh Christ came who is
[18:17] over all God blessed forever a man that
[18:21] was the only reference I think where the
[18:22] word adoption appears in the New
[18:24] Testament that we
[18:25] read this time it appears to be
[18:28] specifically speaking to to the Jewish
[18:32] people to the Israelites to the kinsmen
[18:36] of the Apostle Paul I like that because
[18:40] he is explaining to the Jewish people
[18:43] even though you are the people of God
[18:46] the Covenant people of God
[18:48] you also need spiritual adoption as
[18:53] Yeshua remember we've been teaching on
[18:56] that though he were a son yet he learned
[18:58] obedience by the things he suffered
[19:00] though the Jewish people are the elect
[19:03] and chosen of the Lord they must also
[19:05] come to this place of spiritual adoption
[19:10] as well as the Gentiles and the Apostle
[19:13] was teaching that in Galatians 4 5 which
[19:16] we've read already to redeem them that
[19:18] were under the law that we might receive
[19:21] the adoption of sons or the placing of
[19:25] the mature sons of God and so let me
[19:30] just do a little bit of a review we
[19:33] talked about the different words the the
[19:35] Technion and the TEC known which is a
[19:38] child which was growing up but which is
[19:41] still under parental care which was like
[19:44] the the puberty level
[19:46] hence john 1 and verse 12 he says to
[19:51] them gave he the power to become as many
[19:55] as received him remember it says to as
[19:57] many as received him to them gave he the
[20:00] power to become the sons of God that is
[20:04] techn own that is adolescent
[20:06] to as many as received him to them gave
[20:09] he the power to become as adolescents as
[20:13] teenagers in Christ those who would have
[20:17] celebrated their Bar Mitzvah their their
[20:21] announcement of limited Authority and so
[20:26] we don't want to stop there you know we
[20:28] could say okay he's given us power to be
[20:31] teenager so that's that's the best the
[20:33] kingdom has know we're going to continue
[20:35] to learn from life experience
[20:39] and from spiritual experience we're
[20:41] going to continue to learn how to grow
[20:44] up in Christ and I like oftentimes the
[20:48] Apostle Paul said things like this
[20:50] little children I would love to teach
[20:52] you I would love to give you the strong
[20:54] meat I'd love to give you something to
[20:56] cut your eye teeth on but you still want
[20:59] the milk
[21:00] I'm unable to give you I'm unable to
[21:02] share with you the things that I would
[21:04] like to share with you because you're so
[21:06] easily offended because you're so
[21:09] steeped in your religious doctrines and
[21:12] practices that you're not open to a now
[21:15] word a Rhema word of the Lord and I want
[21:18] to speak to the body of Christ as the
[21:20] Apostle Paul spoke to his kindred and to
[21:23] those believers in his time we don't
[21:25] want to be so rigid and so steeped in
[21:28] man's tradition and in church anity that
[21:31] we miss what God wants to reveal to us
[21:34] from his word by his Spirit in this hour
[21:38] we want to go from truth to truth as
[21:41] well from level to level I remember one
[21:43] of the prophets of the Old Testament was
[21:45] talking about being poured from one
[21:49] vessel to another and I used to do a
[21:52] teaching on the process of winemaking in
[21:55] in the Bible days in the time of the
[21:58] Bible and how that in in making the wine
[22:01] it was it would stay for so long in one
[22:05] type our design of vessel until that
[22:09] vessel had accomplished all that it
[22:11] could accomplish for the for the product
[22:13] for the wine of the juice initially and
[22:16] then it would be poured into another
[22:18] vessel and another vessel eventually it
[22:20] would be poured into a vessel that it
[22:22] could be sealed in and when it was
[22:25] sealed in that's when the pressure would
[22:28] build up and that's when the great
[22:31] process of fermentation would be
[22:33] released and that's when we get real
[22:36] wine we get a breaking down of the
[22:39] sugars and we get a real lovely taste of
[22:44] wine or we would have if if people use
[22:47] that process today I'm sure it's a lot
[22:49] more modernized now than it was in the
[22:51] time of the
[22:52] but we're like that juice first we have
[22:55] to be crushed the grapes are crushed
[22:57] underfoot we have to be crushed and like
[23:00] Gethsemane means the Olive Press the
[23:03] place of the pressing dude to release
[23:07] the oil and and Yeshua in Gethsemane was
[23:10] in the press and he was being pressed
[23:13] and you and I also have to go through
[23:15] that and then there's a step where we
[23:18] are where the little pieces of the grape
[23:20] skin and so forth are are strained off
[23:23] and drained off and the least the Bible
[23:26] calls it in King James the Lee's are
[23:29] left behind the dregs are left behind
[23:31] and only the pure liquid is poured into
[23:34] the next vessel so what we're seeing is
[23:38] that everything we go through every
[23:41] trial every Valley every low place and
[23:44] every high place every victory every
[23:49] what seems like sometime defeat is a
[23:54] part of our maturing process now you may
[23:59] not yet be to the place today that you
[24:02] can look back and say it was worth it
[24:04] all it was worth it all every heartache
[24:07] every tear every trial every moment of
[24:10] deep rejection but I'm telling you you
[24:13] will as a believer in Christ come to a
[24:16] place and I don't think it will
[24:18] necessarily have to be when you stand in
[24:21] the kingdom when you come to heaven that
[24:23] you're going to express that I believe
[24:26] that there will be a place of maturity
[24:28] on this side on this side of the of the
[24:31] great curtain of the great veil that you
[24:34] will be able to say it was worth it all
[24:36] and I don't want to say this boasting or
[24:39] bragging because I know I have more
[24:41] trials to go through more tests
[24:43] more hardship perhaps more persecution
[24:47] to go through to come to the place that
[24:50] the father can trust me with all things
[24:52] I recognize that but I can tell you that
[24:56] I've come through enough and I've seen
[24:58] the benefit of the hardship in my life
[25:01] that I could sing today I could testify
[25:03] to you today you
[25:05] has thus far from from this day backward
[25:09] I could say it has been worth it all it
[25:13] has been worth it all and I'm able to
[25:16] recognize by revelation that every low
[25:19] point of my life I had some unusual
[25:24] circumstances growing up God was with me
[25:27] he visited me at an early age but my
[25:29] parents divorced when I was five years
[25:31] old and I saw a lot of heartache and and
[25:35] I had rejection and I dealt with a lot
[25:38] of different things growing up and
[25:40] coming along but every bit of that was
[25:42] for my good so that I could come to a
[25:45] place that I would be able to reflect
[25:47] the pure love of Jesus Christ I want to
[25:50] be there I want to come to that place
[25:52] where I can speak and it is not me
[25:56] but it is the Word of God flowing out of
[25:58] my life I want to be able to lay hands
[26:01] on the sick and not maybe so and hoping
[26:04] that they'll recover but I want to see
[26:06] again what God has promised the
[26:09] miraculous power of God delivering and
[26:12] setting captives free
[26:13] I want to see those hard cases bound by
[26:17] sin and alcohol and drugs and illicit
[26:20] sexuality and all kinds of seeds of
[26:23] wickedness I want to see people
[26:25] ultimately set free from the gutter most
[26:28] to the uttermost like the apostles I
[26:30] want to see that and I believe that
[26:33] we're about to enter into a season where
[26:36] we're going to see the hand of God
[26:37] moving among us like we have never seen
[26:39] it before and that's why we want to
[26:42] hurry up and and come to that place of
[26:44] maturity we can't speed it up
[26:46] necessarily but I do believe the faster
[26:49] we learn the lesson that God is trying
[26:51] to teach us right now the quicker we can
[26:53] get to the next one well how do we
[26:56] control that I believe we control it by
[26:58] yielding yielding to the pressure if you
[27:02] were the clay in the Potters hand today
[27:04] and you are spiritually speaking a
[27:06] schewe the Lord Jesus is our potter and
[27:09] he's applying the pressure and shaping
[27:12] and molding us into his image and then
[27:15] we're going into the fire then we're
[27:17] going into the care
[27:18] and we're going to be cured we're going
[27:21] to be hardened and then we're going to
[27:23] be a vessel of Honor for the master and
[27:26] one of these days if not already we're
[27:30] going to be able to say it's worth it
[27:31] all so keep pressing into Christ don't
[27:35] allow your circumstances to make you
[27:37] better but allow God to use them to make
[27:40] you better
[27:40] father I ask you right now to release
[27:43] your grace
[27:45] for whoever is needing extra grace in
[27:47] this season because of the pressure of
[27:50] their life release extra grace and help
[27:53] us to learn this lesson quickly so that
[27:56] we can move on to the next one and find
[27:58] that place of maturity in you in the
[28:01] wonderful name of Jesus Yeshua we pray
[28:03] amen thank you for watching the Eagles
[28:06] cry
[28:07] I hope you've heard something that will
[28:08] interest you enough that you'll tune in
[28:10] again next week god bless you bye bye
[28:13] for now
[28:14] [Music]
[28:44] you
