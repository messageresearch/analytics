[17:18] The trials [singing] of [music] this
[17:20] world were getting closer.
[17:26] The pull [music and singing] I felt was
[17:29] more than I could bear.
[17:34] And I was on the verge of just
[17:37] [singing and music] giving over.
[17:41] The strength [music] within myself just
[17:45] wasn't there.
[17:48] But [music] something keeps holding
[17:49] [singing]
[17:50] me.
[17:52] Every day I see
[17:55] he's helping me [music and singing]
[17:57] faithfully
[17:58] to overcome my trials.
[18:03] [music] He's guiding me constantly.
[18:07] [singing] He's giving me victory.
[18:11] He's a reality.
[18:14] Jesus [music] keeps holding me.
[18:20] Satan [singing and music] laid before me
[18:23] his temptation
[18:27] of his [singing and music] desire to
[18:30] steal away my faith.
[18:35] But I have found [singing and music] in
[18:37] time the revelation,
[18:42] [music and singing] the strength I need
[18:44] to keep me by his grace.

[19:00] overcome [music]
[19:01] my trials.
[19:04] He's guiding me constantly.
[19:06] [music and singing]
[19:08] He's giving me victory.
[19:12] He's a reality.
[19:15] Jesus [music] keeps holding me. Can we
[19:18] sing verse two again?
[19:21] Satan [singing] laid before me [music]
[19:24] his temptation
[19:28] of his [singing and music] desire to
[19:30] steal away my faith.
[19:36] But I have found [music]
[19:37] in time the [singing] revelation
[19:43] strength I need to keep me by his grace.
[19:50] Something keeps [singing] holding
[19:51] [music]
[19:52] me.
[19:54] Every day I see
[19:57] he's helping me [music and singing]
[19:58] faithfully
[20:00] to overcome my trials.

[20:05] &gt;&gt; He's guiding [singing] me constantly.
[20:09] He's giving me victory. [singing]
[20:13] It's a reality.
[20:15] Something [music] keeps holding
[20:17] [singing]
[20:17] me.
[20:20] Something keeps [singing] holding me.
[20:24] Every [music] day I see
[20:28] he's helping [singing] me faithfully
[20:31] to overcome my trials.
[20:35] He's guiding me constantly,
[20:39] [singing and music]
[20:39] giving me victory.
[20:43] It's a reality. [singing]
[20:45] [music]
[20:46] Jesus keeps holding me.
[21:01] Falling [singing] in love
[21:04] with Jesus.
[21:08] [music]
[21:09] Falling [singing] in love with Jesus.
[21:12] [music]
[21:17] Falling in love with Jesus.
[21:23] was the best thing I've
[21:25] [singing and music] ever
[21:27] done.
[21:32] In his arms,
[21:34] I [singing and music] feel protected.
[21:40] In [singing] his arms,
[21:42] never disconnected.
[21:46] [music]
[21:47] In his arms,
[21:49] I feel
[21:51] protected.
[21:53] There's no [music] place I'd rather
[21:55] [singing]
[21:56] be.
[22:02] He is my strong and mighty
[22:06] tower. [singing]
[22:09] He is my strength in [singing] my
[22:12] darkest
[22:13] hour.
[22:16] He is my strong and [music] mighty
[22:20] [singing] tower.
[22:22] And there I can feel his power.
[22:31] Falling in love with Jesus.
[22:37] [music]
[22:38] Falling in [singing] love with Jesus.
[22:45] Falling in [singing] love with Jesus.

[22:53] I've ever
[22:55] done.
[23:00] In his arms, [music]
[23:02] I [singing] feel

[23:33] tower. [singing]
[23:36] And he is [music] my strength in my
[23:39] darkest
[23:40] tower.
[23:43] He is my strong [singing] and [music]
[23:46] mighty
[23:47] tower.
[23:49] And there [singing] I can feel his
[23:52] power. Sing falling in love with Jesus
[23:55] again.
[23:57] Falling [singing and music] in love with
[24:00] Jesus.
[24:05] Falling [music] in love with [singing]
[24:07] Jesus.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; [music]
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Falling in love with Jesus
[24:18] was the [music] best thing I've ever
[24:21] done. While she plays that softly this
[24:24] morning, who would have an unspoken
[24:26] prayer request just by the uplifting of
[24:28] the hand, there's needs all over this
[24:30] building. We want to remember everybody
[24:32] out of town traveling. I know some of
[24:34] them are traveling back today and some
[24:35] of them throughout the week. So, let's
[24:36] just remember all of them and every hand
[24:38] that went up.
[24:43] Crystalin and Adelaide and Lydia, I
[24:45] believe they're all sick. We remember
[24:47] them to the Lord. Brother Ellas is not
[24:49] feeling well today. Let us know that he
[24:51] wouldn't be here. We want to pray for
[24:52] him. Sister Beverly was going to the
[24:56] urgent care [music]
[24:57] uh with uh problem that needed to be
[25:00] looked after. Let's ask the Lord to
[25:02] minister to her. We want to remember the
[25:04] family. Mr. passed away and
[25:07] was 98 years old, but he passed and we
[25:10] want to remember his family and we want
[25:13] to remember sister Lydia Whitmire. The
[25:16] Lord will lay his hand upon her as well
[25:18] as sister Alfreda. The Lord will
[25:20] strengthen her, give them courage in
[25:22] this hour. [music] The Lord sees those
[25:24] needs that they have.
[25:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Nathan, would you mind coming
[25:28] and praying today? Let's just sing that
[25:29] again.
[25:31] Falling in love with Jesus.
[25:38] I'm falling in love with Jesus.
[25:46] Falling in love with Jesus
[25:52] was the best thing I've ever
[25:56] done.
[26:01] In his arms
[26:03] I feel
[26:05] protected.
[26:08] In his arms
[26:10] never disconnected.
[26:14] [music]
[26:15] In his arms
[26:18] I feel protected.
[26:21] There's no place I'd ra
[26:25] be.
[26:28] Let's pray. Dear Lord, we we love you.
[26:32] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for your arms. Thank
[26:34] you, Lord, that you protect us.
[26:37] &gt;&gt; That everything that happens to us is
[26:40] for a reason.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus, that you have a
[26:43] plan and a purpose for my life.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, all these needs that are
[26:50] represented, nearly every hand in the
[26:52] building went up. Oh Lord,
[26:55] &gt;&gt; so many on the stream.
[26:58] Lord, I ask that you would just go to
[27:01] each need. For each person that needs
[27:04] healing, I ask Lord Jesus that you would
[27:06] move on their behalf. For you are the
[27:08] healer.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; For each person that is seeking answers,
[27:12] oh Lord, you are the answer. For each
[27:15] person that is grieving, you said, "I'm
[27:17] the comforter."
[27:19] &gt;&gt; I ask, oh Lord, that you would just move
[27:21] for each need that's represented in this
[27:23] house today and over the stream. And I
[27:25] ask Lord as the word goes forth today
[27:28] that you would speak to our hearts. Lord
[27:31] move in our lives. May our ears be
[27:34] attentive to hear what you would have to
[27:35] say to each one of us. Oh Lord, be with
[27:38] that as he ministers that your words
[27:41] would flow through him. Lord, for all of
[27:43] those that are traveling, I ask that you
[27:45] would give them safety on the roadways.
[27:48] Lord, let every step of each person,
[27:52] let them be guided by you. We want to
[27:55] walk in your perfect will. Oh Lord, help
[27:58] us to stay in the vision.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; We ask all these things in the wonderful
[28:04] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Sing this little chorus with me.
[28:15] You are awesome in this place, mighty
[28:21] God.
[28:25] You are awesome in this place of a
[28:30] father.
[28:34] You are [singing] worthy of all praise.
[28:39] To you our lives we raise. You are
[28:44] awesome in [singing] this place, mighty
[28:48] God. Let's just sing that one more time.
[28:51] You [singing] are awesome in this place,
[28:55] [music]
[28:56] mighty God.
[29:00] You are awesome in this place of a
[29:05] father.
[29:08] You are worthy [singing]
[29:10] of all praise.
[29:14] To you our lives we raise. You are
[29:18] awesome in [singing] this place. Mighty
[29:23] God.
[29:25] Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand clap of
[29:27] praise this morning as you're seated.
[29:32] Amen. We want to go take the tithe and
[29:35] offering this morning. Caleb, would you
[29:36] mind coming and helping me hold the
[29:38] offering bag this morning?
[29:43] Go ahead and pray over it. Lord Jesus,
[29:44] bless this tithe and offering. Multiply
[29:46] it and give it back to the giver and use
[29:48] it for your kingdom. In the name of
[29:49] Christ, I pray. Amen. Come and bring
[29:51] your offering this morning.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; It's already
[30:00] done.
[30:06] It's already done.
[30:13] The battle is over
[30:17] and victory is won.
[30:20] It's already done.
[30:28] It's already done.
[30:35] It's already done.
[30:41] The battle is over
[30:45] and victory is won.
[30:49] It's already done.
[30:56] I'm already healed.
[31:03] Oh, I'm [singing] already healed.
[31:10] The battle is over
[31:14] and victory is won.
[31:17] It's already done.
[31:23] [music]
[31:24] My family is sealed.

[33:17] My family is sealed.
[33:24] My family is sealed.
[33:31] The battle is over.
[33:35] Victory is won.
[33:39] It's already done.
[33:43] Once again, it's already

[34:19] Hallelujah.
[34:21] Give me F.
[34:27] Aren't you thankful that the price is
[34:29] already paid?
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Victory is already won.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; We're just stepping into the
[34:36] appropriation of that victory that he
[34:38] has already won on our behalf.
[34:42] It's good to see you in the house of the
[34:44] Lord today. Thank you for being here.
[34:46] It's not nearly as empty as I expected
[34:48] it to be.
[34:51] &gt;&gt; Jennifer, I think you traveled nearly
[34:53] all night. Well,
[34:56] midnight. Well, we're glad that you came
[34:58] back. The Lord bless you for being here
[35:00] today. We're just glad to be in the
[35:02] house of the Lord.
[35:04] Sing this song before we look to the
[35:05] word. When I first fell in love with
[35:08] Jesus,
[35:10] I gave him all of my heart.
[35:13] [music and singing]
[35:14] And I thought that I couldn't love him
[35:18] anymore than I did right from the start.
[35:23] Now I look back over the mountains
[35:27] and the valleys where I've been.
[35:32] It makes me know that I love him so much
[35:37] more than I did then. And I keep falling
[35:42] in love with him over and over and over
[35:46] and over again.
[35:49] I keep falling in love with Jesus over
[35:54] and over and over again. He gets sweeter
[36:00] and sweeter. The days go by. Oh, what a
[36:04] love between my Lord and I. I keep
[36:08] falling in love with him. Over and over
[36:11] and over and over again.
[36:15] There's a hand that I hold on to through
[36:20] each [music] valley and each trial.
[36:24] There's a shoulder that I lean upon as I
[36:29] face another mile.
[36:33] There's a love [music]
[36:34] that I can depend on.
[36:38] It's fresh and new each day.
[36:42] And with love, my heart is overflowing.
[36:47] That is why I say, [music] "Oh, I keep
[36:51] falling in love with Jesus over
[36:56] and over again.
[36:59] I keep falling in love with Jesus over
[37:02] and over, over and over again.
[37:07] He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days
[37:11] go by. Oh, what a love between my Lord
[37:15] and I. I keep falling in love with him
[37:19] over and over and over and over again.
[37:24] Oh, I keep falling in love with Jesus.
[37:29] [music]
[37:30] Over and over again. I keep falling in
[37:36] love with Jesus over and over and over
[37:40] and over again.
[37:42] He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days.
[37:48] Oh, what a love between my Lord and I. I
[37:52] keep falling in love with him over and
[37:56] over and over and over again.
[38:10] I am so grateful that I don't have to
[38:13] fall out of love with him
[38:16] &gt;&gt; to fall in love with him over and over
[38:19] again. But he is so spectacular, so
[38:22] large, so varied in his in his
[38:25] presentation of himself that he presents
[38:28] himself in another way and another way
[38:30] and another way and another way and I
[38:32] just fall in love with him all over
[38:34] again. He's that good. We're glad that
[38:36] you're here today. We're so thankful for
[38:39] Mary Beth and Joshua. Didn't he do a
[38:41] good job for us today leading us in
[38:43] worship? We're so appreciative.
[38:50] Mary Best said that she didn't ever
[38:52] remember playing without somebody else
[38:54] to accompany her. And so we're grateful
[38:59] to have her here today. We're blessed to
[39:04] have all the musicians that we do have
[39:07] and we sure miss them. But I'm glad that
[39:10] God didn't have to only be in one place
[39:14] at one time.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; I'm glad he can be here today. [snorts]
[39:18] &gt;&gt; While you're standing, let's look to the
[39:21] scripture today. Colossians chapter 1.
[39:24] Thank you.
[39:27] Colossians chapter 1.
[39:37] verses 19- 27.
[39:42] Colossians chapter 1 verse
[39:46] 19. For it pleased the father
[39:50] that in him him who Jesus Christ should
[39:55] all fullness dwell.
[39:58] and having made peace through the blood
[40:00] of his cross. by him to reconcile all
[40:04] things unto himself.
[40:07] By him I say, whether they be
[40:10] things in earth or things in heaven. And
[40:14] you that were sometimes alienated and
[40:17] enemies in your mind by wicked works,
[40:20] yet now hath he reconciled
[40:24] in the body of his flesh through death
[40:28] to present you holy and unblameable
[40:32] and unreprovable in his sight. If you
[40:35] continue in the faith grounded and
[40:37] settled, and be not moved away from the
[40:40] hope of the gospel, which you have
[40:42] heard, and which was preached to every
[40:44] creature which is under heaven, whereof
[40:48] I, Paul, am made a minister, who now
[40:52] rejoice in my sufferings for you, and
[40:55] fill up that which is behind of the
[40:58] afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for
[41:02] his body's sake, which is the church,
[41:06] whereof I am made a minister according
[41:09] to the dispensation of God, which is
[41:12] given to me for you to fulfill the word
[41:16] of God, even the mystery which hath been
[41:20] hidden from ages and from generations,
[41:22] but now is made manifest to his saints,
[41:27] to whom God would make known what is the
[41:30] riches of the glory of this mystery
[41:33] among the Gentiles. s which is Christ in
[41:36] you, the hope of glory.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Before you're seated, let's pray once
[41:43] again. Our Father,
[41:47] we're presenting ourselves for service
[41:50] today. We want to thank you for
[41:54] the Holy Spirit that is here. Your
[41:57] spirit that you have allowed to be in
[42:00] our midst today as we carry you with us.
[42:03] Lord, we thank you that your presence
[42:05] has increased here in the house. For
[42:08] each one that has gathered, I thank you
[42:10] for them. Those out across the stream,
[42:13] [snorts] I thank you for them. And we're
[42:16] just settling down now, Lord, to look
[42:19] into your word, how it may help us,
[42:22] strengthen us, guide us, equip us for
[42:26] end time strategy. I pray, Father, that
[42:29] you will help us now as we look into
[42:31] your word, that you would hide the
[42:34] vessel and that you would speak to us
[42:37] from your word, your written word. May
[42:40] it not be letters on a page, but may it
[42:43] become living reality to us and in us.
[42:46] We pray today for our pastor and for all
[42:49] of those that are there in Indiana, even
[42:51] some that'll be traveling this
[42:52] afternoon. We pray God that you will
[42:55] speak your divine word there among those
[42:59] people as they travel home. Bring them
[43:02] safely to us. I pray we give you the
[43:05] honor and the glory, the high seat in
[43:08] the house
[43:09] &gt;&gt; for that is what you deserve. Any
[43:12] distraction, any disturbing spirit, we
[43:14] take authority over it in the name of
[43:16] the Lord Jesus Christ. Even the few in
[43:19] number that we are, we we move it out of
[43:21] the way as a distraction. And we thank
[43:24] you, Lord, that you are present in the
[43:26] house to speak your word to us. We give
[43:28] you praise for it in the name of the
[43:30] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you as you have your seat
[43:36] today.
[43:41] So, as we're reading this scripture
[43:45] again today, it has just been a few
[43:48] short weeks ago that Brother Shelley was
[43:51] uh ministering from some of these
[43:53] verses, but today I would like to zero
[43:57] in on verse 24.
[44:01] Uh
[44:03] my wife provoked
[44:05] study of this verse. What does it mean?
[44:09] So we're looking at let's back up and
[44:14] get a phrase of verse 23. Whereof
[44:18] I Paul am made a minister
[44:22] who now rejoice in my sufferings for you
[44:27] and fill up that which is behind of the
[44:31] afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[44:36] his body's sake which is the church.
[44:40] Now I would like to take the word just a
[44:42] moment the word afflictions
[44:47] because Paul of course was a man who
[44:51] suffered many things along his journey
[44:55] in his walk with the Lord while he was
[44:58] on the earth. The scripture talks about
[45:02] there were people that were discussing
[45:05] the uh how great they were and Paul
[45:10] wanted to get his words in there as well
[45:14] because he wanted to know that he wasn't
[45:17] uh just somebody that had just started
[45:19] the race.
[45:21] He wanted to demonstrate that he was a
[45:25] Pharisee among Pharisees. When it came
[45:28] to the word, he was not stupid.
[45:32] &gt;&gt; He was not uneducated or unlearned.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; And even when he said, "I had to forget
[45:37] all I knew to find Christ," that doesn't
[45:41] mean he forgot all of the scripture that
[45:44] he ever knew.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; He had to forget his theology that went
[45:48] along with it. all of the hours of
[45:51] studying and all of the all of the ways
[45:54] that it was interpreted in time past.
[45:57] That was what he had to forget. He
[45:59] didn't have to forget the scripture
[46:01] because everything that we do,
[46:03] everything that we say, everything that
[46:05] we live, it has to be based in the
[46:08] scripture.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; That's and so he was Pharisee among
[46:12] Pharisees. and and he talked about being
[46:15] shipwrecked and he talked about going
[46:17] after the Christian believers to to put
[46:20] them to death and he talks about all of
[46:23] these things that he experienced and and
[46:25] then [snorts] he talks about his
[46:26] sufferings after he came to the Lord
[46:29] Jesus and he is he is now presenting it
[46:33] to this uh church of the Colossians and
[46:37] he's telling them I was made a minister
[46:40] and and I Now you can re uh you rejoice
[46:44] in my sufferings or I rejoice rather in
[46:47] my sufferings for you and I fill up that
[46:51] which is behind of the afflictions of
[46:55] Christ in my flesh
[46:58] not for his own self but for the body's
[47:01] sake which is the church. Now the word
[47:05] afflictions there is the Greek word
[47:08] flips
[47:12] and it means press
[47:15] or pressing together and it comes from
[47:19] the previous Greek word meaning to press
[47:22] as grapes or to press hard upon.
[47:27] We can find this Greek word used in
[47:31] other places such as in Matthew 13
[47:36] 18- 21 when Jesus said, "Hear ye
[47:40] therefore the parable of the swer."
[47:44] When anyone heareth the word of the
[47:46] kingdom and understands it not, then
[47:50] comes the wicked one and catches away
[47:53] that which was sown in his heart. This
[47:56] is he which received seed by the
[48:00] wayside.
[48:02] But he that received the seed into stony
[48:05] places, the same is he that hears the
[48:09] word
[48:10] &gt;&gt; and anon with joy.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; He receives it.
[48:16] Yet [snorts]
[48:17] &gt;&gt; the word doesn't have any root in him,
[48:20] &gt;&gt; but he endures for a while.
[48:24] For when tribulation
[48:27] pressing
[48:28] for when pressing or persecution arises
[48:32] because of the word by and by he is
[48:37] offended.
[48:39] &gt;&gt; So here we see when the word seed of God
[48:45] comes into certain people
[48:48] they endure for a while.
[48:51] They can't last for a long period of
[48:54] time. You see, the scripture says, "He
[48:57] that endures to the end, the same shall
[49:00] be saved."
[49:01] &gt;&gt; And and here is one that the word got to
[49:05] them or in them in some way, but it
[49:09] didn't it wasn't able to take root in
[49:13] them the way it would take root in good
[49:17] soil. And so as the word is uh it's in
[49:23] them perhaps on a on a rock uh anybody
[49:29] that has been around for a while and
[49:32] seen uh agriculture of any sort and seen
[49:35] the word seen seed that maybe fell on a
[49:39] rock that had a little bit of dirt on
[49:41] it. it would sprout,
[49:44] might even grow a while. But because it
[49:47] had no depth, it could only get so far.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; And that is what Jesus is using to uh to
[49:54] demonstrate here somebody that goes for
[49:57] a little while, but then he says there's
[49:59] no root. And when tribulation or when
[50:03] the pressing starts happening,
[50:06] &gt;&gt; when the pressing or the persecution
[50:08] arises because of the word, he is
[50:11] offended.
[50:15] Now this is not a seasoned believer.
[50:17] This is not one who has good ground that
[50:20] the seed were. This is somebody who uh
[50:23] is sprouted up may even sprouted up
[50:25] quickly but after a while they couldn't
[50:28] endure because of the pressing that has
[50:31] come along. John 16:33 uses this same
[50:35] word where Jesus said, "These things
[50:38] have I spoken unto you that in me you
[50:42] might have
[50:44] peace."
[50:47] In the world, you shall have
[50:50] tribulation,
[50:52] pressing in the world. There's no may
[50:56] about it. You shall have pressing.
[51:00] But be of good cheer. I have overcome
[51:04] the world.
[51:06] &gt;&gt; All right. I I want US TO GET PAST I
[51:10] WANT US TO GET PAST uh this when we see
[51:13] this word tribulation. I want us to get
[51:16] past uh making that synonymous with
[51:20] suffering.
[51:22] I want us to see that this is God's way
[51:25] to press us into our identity. I want us
[51:29] to see that this is God's way of
[51:31] pressing us into our destiny.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Pressing us by the tribulations that
[51:38] come our way. But he said we could have
[51:41] peace in this world that we were sure
[51:43] that tribulations or pressings were
[51:46] going to come. It's part of our our
[51:48] journey in the Lord. That pressing is
[51:51] going to come. And and and but he said
[51:55] you be of good cheer. That's right.
[51:58] &gt;&gt; KEEP YOUR SMILE on in the pressing.
[52:02] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE HAS OVERCOME the world. We
[52:05] just sang. It's already done.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; It would be lovely to know that we never
[52:13] had to go through another trial,
[52:15] &gt;&gt; another pressing,
[52:17] &gt;&gt; but we sing it's already done knowing
[52:20] that Jesus Christ already
[52:24] finished his work.
[52:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. And now it's being appropriated
[52:28] through us.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Acts 14 also uses this word verses 21
[52:35] and 22. When me when they had preached
[52:38] the gospel to that city and had taught
[52:41] many,
[52:43] they returned again to Lististra and to
[52:46] Iconium and Antioch,
[52:50] confirming the souls of the disciples
[52:54] and exhorting them to continue in the
[52:58] faith. Now, I want you to know this is
[52:59] not a Catholic confirming.
[53:04] This is they wanted to see the goods of
[53:06] believers that were walking in the truth
[53:09] [snorts]
[53:10] exhorting them to continue in the faith
[53:13] and that we must go through
[53:17] much pressing
[53:20] to enter in to the kingdom of God.
[53:25] There again, the word tribulation is the
[53:27] pressing
[53:29] scripture that we're very familiar with
[53:31] in Romans chapter 5:es 1-5.
[53:35] Therefore, being justified by faith, we
[53:39] have peace with God through our Lord
[53:42] Jesus Christ,
[53:44] by whom also we have access
[53:48] by faith into this grace, wherein we
[53:52] stand, and we rejoice in hope of the
[53:56] glory of God.
[53:59] And not only so, but we glory in
[54:04] tribulations also.
[54:11] Should we all stand up and clap?
[54:14] [laughter]
[54:17] &gt;&gt; Because of the pressure that we get to
[54:19] endure.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; Not only so, but we glory in
[54:23] tribulations. Yeah.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Why would we glory in tribulation? Why
[54:29] would we glory in pressure? Pressure
[54:32] seems to be something THAT CAUSES US TO
[54:35] GET OFFENDED AND TO POP OFF AT THE MOUTH
[54:37] AND DO OTHER crazy things that we don't
[54:40] really want anybody to see.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; BUT THE WORD IS telling us we know that
[54:46] these pressings are working patience.
[54:53] If you don't ever get the pressings,
[54:57] you don't get the patience.
[55:00] We know that the pressing works patience
[55:04] and patience works experience
[55:10] and experience
[55:12] works hope.
[55:14] and hope maketh not ashamed
[55:18] because the love of God is shed abroad
[55:20] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[55:24] given unto us. Let's read another one in
[55:28] 2 Corinthians chapter 1
[55:31] verses 3-8.
[55:35] We're going somewhere.
[55:38] Blessed be the God, even the father of
[55:40] our Lord Jesus Christ, the father of
[55:42] mercies, and the God of all comfort, who
[55:45] comforteth us in all our
[55:50] tribulation presses, [snorts]
[55:53] &gt;&gt; that we may be able to comfort them
[55:56] which are in trouble,
[55:59] by the comfort wherewith we ourselves
[56:02] are comforted.
[56:06] He comforts us in the times of our
[56:11] pressings, tribulations,
[56:14] in order that we may be able to comfort
[56:18] those
[56:21] &gt;&gt; that are also going through pressings as
[56:24] we have.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; When you go through a tribulation, it's
[56:29] not because God hates you.
[56:31] IT IS NOT BECAUSE THAT HE doesn't want
[56:35] you to be your best.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; It is BECAUSE HE WANTS YOU TO COME
[56:39] THROUGH IT with shining colors
[56:43] &gt;&gt; in order that you and I may be able to
[56:47] comfort the next one that we see going
[56:50] through a tribulation that we can be
[56:53] their cheerleader
[56:55] &gt;&gt; TO SAY, "GOD GAVE ME GRACE. I know that
[56:59] he'll give you grace.
[57:02] &gt;&gt; WE'RE PAST IT, FRIENDS, where that WE
[57:05] SAY, "GOD GAVE ME GRACE TO GET THROUGH
[57:08] IT. You may as well have the same stuff
[57:10] I had."
[57:12] NO, IT IS SO THAT WE CAN BY GRACE we can
[57:17] come ALL THE WAY THROUGH THAT WE MAY
[57:19] COMFORT THE NEXT one that we see is
[57:22] under the same pressure, under the same
[57:25] pressing that we were under so that we
[57:28] can encourage THEM AND SAY THE GOD OF
[57:31] ALL GRACE. He gave me the grace TO GO
[57:34] THROUGH. HE'S GOING TO GIVE YOU the
[57:36] grace to go through.
[57:41] We've got to keep reading. FOR AS THE
[57:43] SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST ABOUND in us, so
[57:48] our consolation also aboundeth by
[57:51] Christ.
[57:53] And whether we be afflicted,
[57:56] it is for your consolation and
[57:59] salvation.
[58:01] Now, I want you to I want you to notice
[58:03] as we're reading this scripture that
[58:05] that Jesus already went through
[58:09] suffering.
[58:10] But I WANT YOU TO KEEP IN mind what our
[58:13] pastor has been trying to tell us ABOUT
[58:16] THE END TIME BRIDAL COMPANY, the
[58:18] Messiah.
[58:20] NOW
[58:23] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE NOT GOING THROUGH this world
[58:26] through this life WITH WITH NO TRIALS,
[58:30] no temptations, no no afflictions, NO
[58:34] TRIBULATIONS. THEY'RE GOING through uh
[58:38] getting all of these, receiving all of
[58:40] these by the hand of God because we are
[58:44] his body
[58:47] &gt;&gt; in the earth in the end time.
[58:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:50] SO AS THE SUFFERINGS OF CHRIST ABOUND in
[58:54] us, so our consolation also aboundeth in
[58:58] Christ. Now I want you to remember also
[59:01] that again we are not Catholic. WE ARE
[59:04] NOT GOING OUT AND ASKING for all kinds
[59:07] of sufferings to come to us because
[59:10] we're doing penance. THAT'S NONSENSE.
[59:13] JESUS CHRIST paid the price that we
[59:16] don't have to go through that kind of
[59:18] suffering and pain that he went through.
[59:22] But he's allowing us to go through
[59:24] things in our life to bring us into a
[59:28] mature state
[59:30] &gt;&gt; because
[59:31] as the sufferings of Christ abound in
[59:34] us, so our consolation abounds by
[59:36] Christ. Whether we be afflicted,
[59:39] watch this, it is for your consolation
[59:43] and salvation,
[59:46] &gt;&gt; which is effectual in the enduring of
[59:50] the same sufferings which we also
[59:52] suffer.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Or whether we be comforted, it is for
[59:57] your consolation and salvation. and our
[1:00:00] hope of you is steadfast, knowing that
[1:00:03] as you are partakers of the suffering,
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; so shall you also be of the consolation.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:15] So the tribulation, the pressing that is
[1:00:18] happening, it is working something
[1:00:21] inside of us that we may be
[1:00:24] demonstrators of Christ life
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; in the end time to those who are being
[1:00:30] pressed.
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:33] a pressing maybe that you have already
[1:00:35] gone through and you have come through
[1:00:38] by the comfort of the Holy Ghost, by the
[1:00:41] comfort of another brother or sister who
[1:00:44] encouraged you along the way. Now you
[1:00:47] have gone through that and you are
[1:00:49] carrying
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; these entities these these
[1:00:55] characteristics inside of you so that
[1:00:58] you may be a consolation a comfort to
[1:01:01] someone else. Amen.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; FOR WE WOULD NOT, BRETHREN, have you
[1:01:06] ignorant of our trouble, which came to
[1:01:08] us in Asia, that we were pressed out of
[1:01:12] measure
[1:01:14] above strength, in so much that we
[1:01:19] despared
[1:01:21] even of life.
[1:01:24] So we have established in these
[1:01:27] scriptures
[1:01:28] that there are places that use this same
[1:01:33] Greek word to describe afflictions.
[1:01:37] Now I would like to now return to
[1:01:42] Colossians chapter 1 verse 24. And I
[1:01:45] would like to read to you verse 24 in
[1:01:48] the amplified so that we can get a
[1:01:51] further understanding of what we're
[1:01:53] talking about. Colossians 1:24 in the
[1:01:56] amplified. Even now I rejoice in the
[1:02:00] midst of my sufferings on your behalf
[1:02:04] and in my own person
[1:02:08] I am making up whatever is still lacking
[1:02:12] and remains to be completed on our part
[1:02:16] of Christ's affliction
[1:02:19] for the sake of his body which is the
[1:02:23] church. Now
[1:02:27] again,
[1:02:28] we have not been called to do penance.
[1:02:34] That is that is not part of the
[1:02:37] scripture.
[1:02:39] What I do want to point out is that
[1:02:43] there is apparently something that
[1:02:46] remains to be completed
[1:02:49] of Christ
[1:02:51] in the earth in the end time.
[1:02:55] There is something that has to be
[1:02:57] completed and that completion is going
[1:03:01] to come through the bride of Jesus
[1:03:03] Christ.
[1:03:05] And the bride of Jesus Christ is not
[1:03:09] just somebody that he dropped on a
[1:03:12] church pew and said, "You're good enough
[1:03:15] to handle what I've called you to."
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be lovely?
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Just to be
[1:03:28] dropped into a position, be fully
[1:03:31] equipped all at once. That would be that
[1:03:34] would be so marvelous to you know a lot
[1:03:39] of people that talk about being put in a
[1:03:43] position of a job where that they were
[1:03:45] basically dropped head first into their
[1:03:47] position and nobody taught them anything
[1:03:49] and they had to learn it as they went
[1:03:52] and and uh it was uh it was not an easy
[1:03:55] process but after a while through uh
[1:03:58] humps and bumps and mistakes they they
[1:04:00] got to that they learned their position
[1:04:02] quite Well, well, that's kind of how we
[1:04:05] are as believers. We we got dropped in
[1:04:08] head first and [snorts] uh we we we
[1:04:11] thought that when we accepted the Lord
[1:04:13] Jesus as our savior that we would uh
[1:04:16] everything would be just exactly all
[1:04:19] right and it it will be. Amen.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; You know, to to know that you're born
[1:04:24] again, to know that you've been saved uh
[1:04:27] by the by the blood of Jesus Christ,
[1:04:30] that you don't have to take stripes or
[1:04:33] die a physical death. We're in a
[1:04:35] partnership with him.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; And we're in a partnership with his
[1:04:41] death.
[1:04:46] Paul said, "I die daily."
[1:04:51] We're in a partnership with his death.
[1:04:54] We don't have to be put in a grave. He
[1:04:59] did that.
[1:05:01] We don't have to take stripes on our
[1:05:03] back. He did that. We don't HAVE TO HANG
[1:05:07] ON A CROSS. He did that.
[1:05:11] We are entering into a partnership with
[1:05:13] his sufferings knowing that as as he
[1:05:17] died the physical death he gave his
[1:05:19] blood that we could be redeemed to him.
[1:05:22] He wanted us to be in a partnership with
[1:05:25] him where that we are willing to also
[1:05:28] die to self.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS HIS FINAL battle in the garden
[1:05:33] of Gethsemane? Not my will but thy will
[1:05:36] be done. Amen.
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; And as believers, we've heard it over
[1:05:42] and over again in OUR JOURNEY THAT THAT
[1:05:44] IS EXACTLY what is happening with us.
[1:05:47] We're having a garden of Gethsemane
[1:05:49] nearly every day.
[1:05:50] &gt;&gt; Not my will but thine be done. We're
[1:05:53] dying. We're dying to self. We're
[1:05:56] partakers as as uh 2 Corinthians 1:7
[1:06:00] said, "We're a partner. We're an
[1:06:03] associate. We're a comrade. We're a
[1:06:06] companion. We're a sharer of these
[1:06:08] things uh that Jesus suffered. And
[1:06:12] again,
[1:06:14] we're not seeing how much we can suffer.
[1:06:21] We're not going to look for sufferings.
[1:06:23] We're not we're not trying to see how
[1:06:27] bloody we can get.
[1:06:33] Sometimes we feel blooded.
[1:06:38] But we are not trying to draw blood.
[1:06:42] We'll leave that to
[1:06:44] the doctors.
[1:06:47] We are trying to come into a partnership
[1:06:50] with the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:06:53] We read in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 6-18,
[1:06:58] for God who commanded the light to shine
[1:07:02] out of darkness
[1:07:04] has shined in our hearts to give the
[1:07:08] light of the knowledge of the glory of
[1:07:12] God in the face of Christ Jesus.
[1:07:17] But we have this treasure in earthn
[1:07:20] vessels. Amen.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; That the excellency of the power may be
[1:07:27] of God and not of us.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; God our creator is getting the glory
[1:07:38] not mankind.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Paul continues to write, "We are
[1:07:44] troubled on every side yet not
[1:07:47] distressed.
[1:07:49] We are perplexed
[1:07:51] but not in despair.
[1:07:55] Persecuted
[1:07:56] but not forsaken.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Cast down
[1:08:01] but not destroyed.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Always bearing about in the body
[1:08:12] the dying
[1:08:13] of the Lord Jesus.
[1:08:17] always bearing about
[1:08:20] in the body
[1:08:23] the dying of the Lord Jesus.
[1:08:27] And what is the purpose of the dying?
[1:08:30] That the life also of Jesus might be
[1:08:34] made manifest in our body.
[1:08:38] This is not to be showoff.
[1:08:42] This is not to be able to toot your horn
[1:08:46] uh that you have exceeded or excelled
[1:08:49] someone else. This is uh this is about
[1:08:53] glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ in our
[1:08:57] life so that the life of Jesus might be
[1:09:00] made manifest and displayed
[1:09:05] to those around us.
[1:09:08] For we are always, we which live are
[1:09:10] always delivered unto death for Jesus'
[1:09:13] sake, that the life also of Jesus might
[1:09:16] be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
[1:09:20] Oh,
[1:09:23] we live, [snorts]
[1:09:26] we're always delivered to death for
[1:09:28] Jesus' sake for a particular reason,
[1:09:33] that the life also of Jesus might be
[1:09:35] made manifest
[1:09:38] when we get back in our glorified
[1:09:39] bodies.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Wait a minute.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; I threw something at you there.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT WAITING TILL WE GET BACK in
[1:09:54] our glorified bodies.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; This is so that we MIGHT MANIFEST JESUS
[1:10:01] CHRIST IN THE BODY THAT WE NOW live in.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; It's going to be good when we ALL HAVE
[1:10:11] OUR GLORIFIED bodies and we're all
[1:10:13] together and there's no more sin. But
[1:10:15] Jesus came that we COULD HAVE LIFE AND
[1:10:18] THAT WE COULD HAVE IT more abundantly so
[1:10:20] that WE COULD DEMONSTRATE THE LIFE OF
[1:10:23] JESUS CHRIST in this mortal body that we
[1:10:26] now live. We don't He doesn't want us to
[1:10:29] wait until the glorified body or the
[1:10:31] theophony BODY. HE WANTS US TO manifest
[1:10:34] that life of Jesus Christ while we live
[1:10:38] in this mortal body.
[1:10:40] WE CAN'T JUST EXIST THE NUMBER OF years
[1:10:43] that we've been given and hope that
[1:10:45] everything's going to be okay. NO, WE'VE
[1:10:48] GOT TO EMBRACE the pressure that comes,
[1:10:51] THE TRIBULATION THAT COMES our way.
[1:10:54] Because this pressing that is happening
[1:10:57] is because he wants to make manifest in
[1:11:00] my mortal flesh the very nature the
[1:11:04] character THE DEMONSTRATION OF Jesus
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; in the earth in the end time.
[1:11:16] So then death workketh in us but life in
[1:11:19] you.
[1:11:21] We having the same spirit of faith
[1:11:23] according as is written. I believed and
[1:11:25] therefore have I spoken. We believe and
[1:11:28] therefore speak knowing that he which
[1:11:31] raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise up
[1:11:35] us also by Jesus and shall present us
[1:11:38] with you. For all things are for your
[1:11:41] sakes, that the abundant grace might
[1:11:45] through the thanksgiving of many
[1:11:49] redounded
[1:11:51] to the glory of God.
[1:11:54] For which cause
[1:11:57] we faint not.
[1:12:00] But though our outward man perish, yet
[1:12:03] the inward man is being renewed day by
[1:12:07] day.
[1:12:09] For our light affliction, our pressing,
[1:12:12] which is but for a moment, workketh for
[1:12:15] us a far more exceeding and eternal
[1:12:19] weight of glory.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; While we look not at the things which
[1:12:25] are seen, but at the things which are
[1:12:27] not seen. For the things which are seen
[1:12:30] are temporal, but the things which are
[1:12:33] not seen are
[1:12:36] eternal.
[1:12:43] 1955, Brother Brandham made a statement
[1:12:46] like this. He said, "I remember when
[1:12:49] brethren and I were in the mountains
[1:12:52] real early in the morning around 4:00.
[1:12:56] We'd rise up, look, hanging back there,
[1:12:59] and there was the morning star. It gets
[1:13:01] real dark just before the break of day."
[1:13:04] When we see the darkness gathering now,
[1:13:07] what is it? It's light pressing against
[1:13:12] darkness.
[1:13:14] One has to give way.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; All the creeping things that's been
[1:13:19] running around through the night, when
[1:13:21] the sun comes up, they take shelter when
[1:13:23] the light shines.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Night and dark. Night and light cannot
[1:13:29] exist in the same building.
[1:13:32] IT'S EITHER DARK or it's light. And the
[1:13:35] light is so much more powerful than the
[1:13:38] darkness.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; SO IS CHRIST SO MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN
[1:13:42] all the enemies of the world. NOW WE ARE
[1:13:45] TAUGHT BY SCIENTISTS as the light begins
[1:13:47] to come, it condenses the darkness and
[1:13:51] the darkness gathers all of its host
[1:13:53] together to fight against the light. But
[1:13:56] the light prevails and comes on.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see the light will always
[1:14:04] overpower the darkness.
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; The darkness,
[1:14:08] the darkness has no comprehension
[1:14:12] of light.
[1:14:15] When light comes,
[1:14:17] it is pushing all of the darkness away.
[1:14:20] And that is what these pressings on us
[1:14:23] are doing. They are pressing the
[1:14:25] darkness away. You remember he was
[1:14:28] talking about all the creeping things
[1:14:29] that run around in the night. We've had
[1:14:32] some creeping things that have liked
[1:14:34] darkness rather than light because the
[1:14:36] deeds were evil.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; Ephesians.
[1:14:41] But when the light comes, all those
[1:14:44] creeping things have to take a shelter
[1:14:46] somewhere. Amen.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; And because that we are the temple of
[1:14:51] the Holy Ghost and we don't want any of
[1:14:54] those creeping things left in us, THEY
[1:14:56] HAVE TO TAKE FLIGHT and go back where
[1:14:58] they came from BECAUSE LIGHT AND
[1:15:01] DARKNESS ARE NOT GOING TO EXIST TOGETHER
[1:15:03] in the same body. Amen.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; I am a child of light
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; and I AM DECREED OVER MY OWN LIFE that
[1:15:15] in me THERE IS NO DARKNESS AT ALL.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; WELL, that's a pretty proud boast there,
[1:15:23] preacher.
[1:15:24] It's already done.
[1:15:28] &gt;&gt; I'M STILL WORKING WITH THE LORD IN ALL
[1:15:30] THE APPROPRIATIONS.
[1:15:32] THERE'S STILL A DYING THAT IS TAKING
[1:15:34] PLACE. THERE'S STILL THE PRESSING TO
[1:15:37] PRESS OUT ALL OF THE DARKNESS SO THAT
[1:15:39] ALL THOSE CREEPING THINGS don't have any
[1:15:41] place to hide.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE HAVE to have the light of
[1:15:46] the gospel preached to us and it can't
[1:15:49] be a m cannot be a mixture.
[1:15:55] WE CANNOT HAVE TRUTH AND FABLES MIXED
[1:15:57] TOGETHER WHEN WE ARE BEING PREACHED TO
[1:16:00] BECAUSE WE ARE uh we are longing for the
[1:16:04] truth of the word to be so clear, so
[1:16:07] crisp, so light in us that there is not
[1:16:11] one single crevice
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; where that some of these little
[1:16:16] scurrying things can hide from the all
[1:16:20] powerful search light of the goodness of
[1:16:22] God in our lives. lives because WE HAVE
[1:16:25] BEEN CALLED FOR SOMETHING FRIENDS.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; We're partakers of the afflictions.
[1:16:30] We're affl we're partakers OF THE
[1:16:32] PRESSING BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN CALLED AS
[1:16:35] MESSIAHES. WE have been called as a
[1:16:38] PERSON FILLED UP WITH Jesus to
[1:16:41] demonstrate
[1:16:43] to another generation
[1:16:46] to those who
[1:16:49] don't already know or haven't already
[1:16:52] come through.
[1:16:54] You see, beauty
[1:16:57] and perfection
[1:17:00] and goodness and quality and usability,
[1:17:05] they don't come with ease,
[1:17:10] nor do they come instantaneously.
[1:17:16] Salvation's free.
[1:17:22] It's
[1:17:23] already been paid for.
[1:17:26] But I have to cooperate with the
[1:17:29] finished work
[1:17:31] through the ABCs.
[1:17:36] Accept,
[1:17:39] believe,
[1:17:40] and confess.
[1:17:43] That's my cooperation
[1:17:46] with salvation.
[1:17:51] I can confess
[1:17:53] that I
[1:17:55] am saved by the blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:17:58] Christ
[1:18:01] and then turn around tomorrow
[1:18:05] and for whatever reason
[1:18:08] because of darkness that is prevailing
[1:18:11] or pushing in against me, my confession
[1:18:14] can be
[1:18:16] I'm lost.
[1:18:18] I've never been saved. I I don't I I
[1:18:22] don't know if I'm ever going to be good
[1:18:23] enough for the kingdom of God.
[1:18:26] And then the next day, the darkness
[1:18:29] dissipates a little bit and your
[1:18:31] confession becomes,
[1:18:34] I'm saved. I believe that Jesus saved
[1:18:36] me.
[1:18:38] Now,
[1:18:41] my Lord doesn't want you to live in that
[1:18:44] kind of an instability.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; My Lord Jesus paid an ultimate price for
[1:18:55] you and for me so that I don't have to
[1:18:58] live in that up and down.
[1:19:02] He gave me an assurance that I am saved.
[1:19:07] AND HOW DO I KEEP THAT ASSURANCE? Number
[1:19:10] one, I accepted that assurance.
[1:19:14] It has become an insurance policy for
[1:19:16] me. I believe what the word of GOD SAYS
[1:19:21] ABOUT THE FINISHED WORK OF CALVARY. AND
[1:19:24] THAT IS THE CONFESSION THAT I MAKE.
[1:19:28] Do I always feel
[1:19:35] like I'm saved?
[1:19:39] No. There are some days [snorts]
[1:19:42] that the battle gets pretty hot and
[1:19:44] heavy
[1:19:47] and the feeling isn't there.
[1:19:51] I don't feel like running the aisles.
[1:19:54] I don't feel like screaming. Hallelujah.
[1:19:58] I don't feel like lifting my hands. I
[1:20:02] don't feel like that I'm a child of God.
[1:20:07] But my confession remains.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; I am born again.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Now that
[1:20:17] comes
[1:20:19] when when we accept the Lord Jesus.
[1:20:23] That is an instantaneous thing. The fact
[1:20:25] is it's already done. It was all it was
[1:20:28] just an instantaneous moment where that
[1:20:31] I said yes Lord I believe that you died
[1:20:34] for my sins. You were you were you died.
[1:20:37] You were buried and you rose again on
[1:20:39] the third day. Uh that was for my
[1:20:42] justification my sanctification. That
[1:20:45] was so that I could carry your spirit. I
[1:20:47] believe that that came as an
[1:20:49] instantaneous and even when you received
[1:20:52] or I received the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:55] Ghost that was an instantaneous
[1:20:58] happening per se.
[1:21:00] It happened the baptism happened all at
[1:21:03] once
[1:21:06] for the most part.
[1:21:08] On the other hand,
[1:21:11] we continue to have these rebaptisms
[1:21:16] because he is continuing his work in us.
[1:21:20] &gt;&gt; He is he his desire is that he himself
[1:21:25] would live in us in a fullness to where
[1:21:28] that we would be fully demonstrated to
[1:21:31] the people that are around us.
[1:21:34] Yet he knows according to Jeremiah 17
[1:21:37] that the heart is deceitful above all
[1:21:40] things
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; and it's desperately wicked. And who can
[1:21:44] know it? I THE Lord search the heart. I
[1:21:48] try the reigns
[1:21:51] even to give every man according to his
[1:21:54] ways and according to the fruit of his
[1:21:56] doings.
[1:21:59] Then we read in Proverbs 17:3, "The
[1:22:01] finding pot is for silver,
[1:22:05] the furnace for gold, but the Lord tries
[1:22:10] the heart."
[1:22:12] Very similar in so Proverbs 27:21,
[1:22:16] "As the finding pot for silver and the
[1:22:19] furnace for gold, so is a man to his
[1:22:23] praise."
[1:22:26] Now, what does that mean? So is a man to
[1:22:29] his praise. Well, let's see an amplified
[1:22:31] version of it. As the refining pot for
[1:22:34] silver and the furnace for gold bring
[1:22:37] forth all the impurities of the metal,
[1:22:41] so let a man be in his trial of praise,
[1:22:46] ridding himself of all that is base
[1:22:51] or insincere.
[1:22:53] For a man is judged by what he praises
[1:22:58] and of what he boasts.
[1:23:02] Now you think about
[1:23:04] the things that you put your blessing
[1:23:06] on, the things that you praise.
[1:23:10] You think about what you boast about.
[1:23:17] And God is taking us through a refining
[1:23:21] process
[1:23:23] because he wants to bring us forth like
[1:23:27] pure gold.
[1:23:30] Peter tells us that the trial of our
[1:23:33] faith is much more precious than that of
[1:23:36] gold.
[1:23:38] Now, gold, 24 karat gold,
[1:23:45] in my reading, 24 karat gold melts at
[1:23:51] 1,947°
[1:23:54] F.
[1:23:58] I'd say that's pretty hot.
[1:24:02] those that complain about 95 degrees in
[1:24:04] the Alabama summer.
[1:24:08] 1,947
[1:24:10] degrees is pretty hot.
[1:24:13] So, we have the furnace
[1:24:15] for the gold.
[1:24:18] And then I I I read where that pure
[1:24:21] silver melts at 1,763°
[1:24:27] F
[1:24:29] and sterling silver melts at 1,640°
[1:24:36] F. These are all still very hot
[1:24:38] temperatures.
[1:24:40] We know that silver is used for fine
[1:24:43] jewelry, as is gold. People are looking
[1:24:47] for the purest of these to uh to wear
[1:24:52] around their neck or on their finger or
[1:24:54] whatever. Sometimes it seems like a
[1:24:57] bunch of nonsense to spend that much
[1:24:58] money and they then go flaunt it out in
[1:25:01] the world when there's folks that are
[1:25:04] just looking for something to steal.
[1:25:12] Yet people do it
[1:25:14] as they do with diamonds.
[1:25:18] Diamonds
[1:25:20] are composed of pure carbon.
[1:25:26] Now, interestingly,
[1:25:30] a lead pencil
[1:25:33] which has relatively little value
[1:25:38] is pure carbon.
[1:25:43] And then also
[1:25:46] coal,
[1:25:48] which is a bit more expensive than a
[1:25:50] lead pencil,
[1:25:55] which
[1:25:56] is used for heating purposes.
[1:25:59] It is also pure carbon,
[1:26:02] but not nearly as valuable as a diamond.
[1:26:08] A diamond has to go through a process.
[1:26:12] The value of it is increased by pressure
[1:26:18] and heat.
[1:26:23] The lead pencil
[1:26:25] didn't take very much heat.
[1:26:28] The coal,
[1:26:31] chunks of coal took a little more, but
[1:26:34] they didn't take as much as the diamond.
[1:26:37] The diamond, in order to become a
[1:26:39] precious jewel, it had to take
[1:26:42] tremendous heat and pressure.
[1:26:48] Sapphires,
[1:26:51] Sapphires are formed through also
[1:26:54] intense heat and pressure.
[1:26:58] I'm bringing these in because they are a
[1:27:01] part of the new city.
[1:27:05] And he said, I go away to prepare a
[1:27:07] mansion. If it were not true, I would
[1:27:09] have told you so. In my father's house,
[1:27:13] there are many
[1:27:16] mansions rooms.
[1:27:23] And if you still are operating on
[1:27:25] denominational theology where you think
[1:27:28] we're all going to go live in our own
[1:27:30] separate house or mansion when we get to
[1:27:33] heaven.
[1:27:38] What would be the use?
[1:27:42] When it finally hit my thinking, I
[1:27:46] thought, what are we going to all become
[1:27:48] a bunch of recluses?
[1:27:51] We're all going TO HAVE OUR GREAT BIG
[1:27:53] MANSIONS and we're GOING TO LIVE ALL BY
[1:27:55] OURSELF IN OUR GREAT BIG MANSION THAT'S
[1:27:58] GOING TO HAVE A GOLD FRONT DOOR and it's
[1:28:01] going to have jewels all over it for
[1:28:04] what?
[1:28:10] I [screaming]
[1:28:11] you are the mansion that is being
[1:28:13] prepared.
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE WHAT IS BEING PREPARED. AND HE
[1:28:19] WHEN HE TALKED ABOUT THAT new city, that
[1:28:22] new Jerusalem coming down from God OUT
[1:28:24] OF HEAVEN AND HE TALKED ABOUT ALL of
[1:28:26] those precious jewels THAT WERE A PART
[1:28:28] OF THAT CITY. [snorts] ALL OF THEM CAME
[1:28:32] BY INTENSE heat and pressure.
[1:28:38] The value
[1:28:40] increases
[1:28:42] with heat and pressure.
[1:28:47] Sapphires form through intense heat and
[1:28:50] pressure. Let's get another one. Jasper.
[1:28:54] Jasper. Its formation starts with silica
[1:28:59] rich fluids
[1:29:01] often derived from geothermal or
[1:29:05] volcanic activity. What is volcanic
[1:29:08] activity? It's heat and pressure.
[1:29:12] And then it flows that that uh silicar
[1:29:17] fluid then flows into porous rock or
[1:29:20] sediment and starts forming this jasper
[1:29:23] stone. All right.
[1:29:26] So heat and pressure
[1:29:30] and and I don't want you to I don't want
[1:29:33] you to leave today discouraged because
[1:29:35] of the thought of heat and pressure. I
[1:29:38] don't want us TO BE DISCOURAGED. WHAT I
[1:29:41] WANT US TO focus on is what he is making
[1:29:44] out of us.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT JUST HUMAN FLESH ON THIS EARTH
[1:29:49] TAKING up space for a certain number of
[1:29:51] years, then we die and that's the end of
[1:29:53] it. He is making something of us that
[1:29:57] far exceeds what we have THOUGHT IN TIME
[1:29:59] PAST. He is making us into his likeness,
[1:30:03] into his image, from glory to glory.
[1:30:06] He's changing me.
[1:30:09] his likeness and his image
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; to perfect in me
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; the light of God shown to the world.
[1:30:22] So because of all this pressing that's
[1:30:25] happening in me,
[1:30:28] death is taking place inside of me and
[1:30:31] it's making way so that Jesus can be
[1:30:34] seen in me. And when people see Jesus in
[1:30:38] me, when people see Jesus in you, their
[1:30:42] faith is ignited.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Their faith is raised up to another
[1:30:49] level. That's right.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; There are PEOPLE WHO ARE DISGUSTED WITH
[1:30:55] modern Christianity. COME ON NOW.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; THEY'RE TIRED OF WHAT THEY SEE BECAUSE
[1:31:00] ALL IT IS IS GO TO church and then live
[1:31:02] the rest of the week
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; any way they want to live.
[1:31:07] That's not the bridal company.
[1:31:09] The bridal company is taking on the
[1:31:12] word, the living word, moment by moment,
[1:31:15] day by day, not only on service times,
[1:31:18] but day by day, every day, taking on the
[1:31:21] Lord Jesus Christ because there's a life
[1:31:24] that is being formed in us. Some it has
[1:31:28] been been being formed longer than
[1:31:30] others. But it is the life of Jesus
[1:31:33] Christ that is inside of us allowing for
[1:31:37] the faith of someone else to be ignited
[1:31:41] to say I don't have to live the way I've
[1:31:44] been living. I don't have to live
[1:31:46] defeated and downhearted all the days of
[1:31:49] my life. There is something supernatural
[1:31:53] that is taking place on the inside of a
[1:31:56] body of believers that is in order for
[1:31:58] us to have the final harvest in the end
[1:32:02] time.
[1:32:07] Someone sees you dying to yourself,
[1:32:11] dying to your anger, and dying to your
[1:32:15] bitterness,
[1:32:17] dying to your envies,
[1:32:20] dying out to having it your way, dying
[1:32:25] out and rising to new levels in the Lord
[1:32:28] Jesus Christ.
[1:32:30] It's his divine life [snorts]
[1:32:33] that is coming to the forefront.
[1:32:39] And although the reining the refining
[1:32:42] process doesn't feel good,
[1:32:45] when somebody sees you
[1:32:49] coming through your refining process,
[1:32:52] when somebody sees you withstanding
[1:32:55] pressure,
[1:32:57] when somebody sees you coming through a
[1:33:00] pressurized process of your life and
[1:33:03] coming out victorious, coming out with a
[1:33:06] smile, coming out with the joy of the
[1:33:08] Lord. They're going to say, "I believe
[1:33:10] that I'll let the pressings come to me.
[1:33:13] I believe that this is what I want
[1:33:16] because I want Jesus to be alive in me."
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF all of it?
[1:33:25] TO WHOM GOD WOULD MAKE KNOWN WHAT IS THE
[1:33:28] RICHEST OF THE GLORY OF THIS MYSTERY
[1:33:31] among the Gentiles
[1:33:33] which is Christ in you the hope of glory
[1:33:39] what are we filling
[1:33:43] what is being filled up it is the
[1:33:45] demonstration the lived life the
[1:33:47] demonstration o of Messiah the
[1:33:50] demonstration of Jesus Christ in the end
[1:33:54] time
[1:33:57] he is taking those afflictions. You see,
[1:34:03] we see that Paul was talking about
[1:34:06] something that had to be filled up in
[1:34:09] us.
[1:34:13] Christ already, Jesus Christ already
[1:34:14] went through it. He already
[1:34:17] appropriated,
[1:34:18] but he put us on this earth.
[1:34:22] the scripture that we use so often.
[1:34:25] Though he were a son, yet he learned
[1:34:29] obedience
[1:34:31] by the things that he suffered,
[1:34:33] the things that he went through, the
[1:34:35] pressings that came to him. That's how
[1:34:38] he learned obedience. And the Lord Jesus
[1:34:42] put us on this earth in in our in a
[1:34:45] fallen state be as brother Brandham once
[1:34:48] put it. He said it was so that we could
[1:34:50] prove our love to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:34:54] We could demonstrate how much we love
[1:34:56] him by all of the things that we go
[1:34:58] through
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; in this fallen state.
[1:35:04] He didn't put us in the earth in a
[1:35:05] perfected state. He put us here as a
[1:35:08] fallen human being.
[1:35:11] We came just as David talked about. I
[1:35:15] came from my mother's womb as a liar.
[1:35:19] Nobody had to teach it to me.
[1:35:23] I came
[1:35:26] as a I came with a fallen na fallen
[1:35:30] nature here on this earth
[1:35:33] and I had to have a bornag again
[1:35:36] experience
[1:35:38] uh to get back to God because in me was
[1:35:43] that fallen nature where I wanted to
[1:35:45] lie, I wanted to cheat, I wanted to
[1:35:47] steal, I wanted to have bad habits, I
[1:35:50] wanted all the worldly pleasures that
[1:35:53] could be offered
[1:35:55] in a fallen nature. That's what happens.
[1:36:02] We can't be upset with people when
[1:36:04] they're in a fallen state.
[1:36:09] They don't know any better but to keep
[1:36:12] sinning
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; because that's what sinners do. They
[1:36:17] sin. But when we're born again of the
[1:36:20] spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ, our
[1:36:23] nature is changing.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Again, it is not instantaneous.
[1:36:29] It would be lovely, but it's not.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; IT'S A PROCESS that the Lord is working
[1:36:35] in us. It comes through heat. It comes
[1:36:37] through pressure. It comes through
[1:36:40] refining process that he is working in
[1:36:42] us.
[1:36:44] I want you to listen to this from 1954
[1:36:48] Jubilee year.
[1:36:51] Then if in your heart you have received
[1:36:55] the Lord Jesus, you're at peace with
[1:36:58] him. Watch back your life. I'll tell you
[1:37:02] the kind of Christians I like to see
[1:37:05] when they walk down the street. Say,
[1:37:07] "Now look, see that fell going there?
[1:37:10] Now he's a Christian.
[1:37:13] I don't belong to his church, but
[1:37:15] brother, he's a Christian. I tell you,
[1:37:18] I've seen him in the tight places. See
[1:37:20] that woman there? Yes, sir. Well, she
[1:37:22] might not look so popular among the
[1:37:25] women, but she's a Christian. I'll tell
[1:37:27] you, she's a Christian. LET THE WHOLE
[1:37:29] CITY say there's a Christian. They'll
[1:37:32] know it. The Bible said you're sealed.
[1:37:35] Did you ever put a seal on anything?
[1:37:38] They take it up like this and put a seal
[1:37:41] on it. They press it on both sides. They
[1:37:44] see you coming and see you going. Is
[1:37:46] that right? You're a Christian through
[1:37:48] and through. Sealed by the spirit of
[1:37:51] God. They know what you was.
[1:37:55] That's right. It's a pressing, a
[1:37:57] marking, a sealing. That's exactly the
[1:38:00] truth. Now, that's when you're sealed in
[1:38:03] the kingdom of God. Now I want you to I
[1:38:06] want us to remember that there are many
[1:38:11] baptisms
[1:38:13] but there is the final ceiling of the
[1:38:16] bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:38:21] &gt;&gt; Many times we have heard brother
[1:38:23] Brandham talk about the box car and that
[1:38:26] there was a certain time where that it
[1:38:29] would be sealed.
[1:38:31] And we we talk in potential
[1:38:37] because again as Joshua is saying it's
[1:38:40] already done.
[1:38:44] Jesus Christ
[1:38:46] paid the full price
[1:38:49] and it is already done.
[1:38:53] I am living in this life to bring the
[1:38:57] full appropriation that has been made
[1:39:00] for my life.
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; Not just to say I'm saved.
[1:39:07] That's not who I am.
[1:39:11] I am saved,
[1:39:13] but I'm more than just saved.
[1:39:16] I am a bloodbought child of God,
[1:39:20] redeemed by the Lord Jesus Christ. I am
[1:39:24] saved. I am sanctified. I am filled with
[1:39:27] the Holy Ghost. I am sealed to the day
[1:39:30] of my redemption. And the reason I can
[1:39:32] say all of that is because he gave me a
[1:39:35] prefixed destiny and I identify with
[1:39:38] that prefixed destiny.
[1:39:40] YES.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE I identify with that
[1:39:43] predicted destiny, I MAKE IT A PART OF
[1:39:46] MY CONFESSION.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; THAT'S GOOD.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; I HAVE ACCEPTED THE WAY, the truth, and
[1:39:52] the life, the Lord Jesus Christ, AND I
[1:39:55] AM SAVED. I BELIEVE that he said HE
[1:39:58] WHOSOEVER CALLS ON THE NAME OF THE LORD
[1:40:00] SHALL BE SAVED. BUT [screaming] I
[1:40:02] BELIEVE MORE than that. Amen.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; I believe that it is IMPORTANT TO BE
[1:40:07] BAPTIZED IN THE NAME OF JESUS Christ for
[1:40:10] the remission of my sins. I believe that
[1:40:13] and I acted on it. And because I acted
[1:40:16] on it, he said in the word that I could
[1:40:19] be filled because I WAS OBEYING THAT
[1:40:22] PART OF IT, I COULD BE FILLED with the
[1:40:24] Holy Ghost.
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; I confess it.
[1:40:32] I AM TELLING YOU TODAY, I HAVE BEEN
[1:40:34] FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. I COULD
[1:40:37] POINT YOU TO A DAY,
[1:40:41] but I also want to tell you
[1:40:44] that I was not complete as far as
[1:40:47] walking it out at that moment.
[1:40:51] in God's eyes because he could see down
[1:40:55] through the the the days that I would be
[1:40:58] on the earth. In God's eyes, it was
[1:41:01] already to the completion
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; done. [clears throat] But I was put on
[1:41:07] the earth as you were at a certain day,
[1:41:09] at a certain time. And he already has a
[1:41:12] certain day and a certain time that I
[1:41:14] WILL BE COMPLETE on this earth. And he
[1:41:16] was able through all of that journeying
[1:41:19] to give me a prefix destiny and in his
[1:41:22] eyes say it's done.
[1:41:27] But I am I am appropriating it. I am
[1:41:31] carrying it out. I am becoming a
[1:41:34] participant
[1:41:36] in my story.
[1:41:39] There are some things that are already
[1:41:41] history
[1:41:44] because I was a participant in my story.
[1:41:47] But I continue to be a participant in my
[1:41:50] story because the Lord Jesus has a
[1:41:54] desire to bring me you to a full place
[1:41:59] of maturity WHERE THAT AS PAUL WAS
[1:42:02] TELLING the churches in in the Colossian
[1:42:06] church and the Corinthian church, he was
[1:42:08] telling them these afflictions, these
[1:42:10] pressings are coming because there is
[1:42:13] something that is taking place inside of
[1:42:16] you, inside of me. He was saying it
[1:42:18] about himself. But he as he was saying
[1:42:21] it about himself, he was trying to get
[1:42:23] the message across. I am going through
[1:42:26] all of this so that I can bring comfort
[1:42:29] and consolation to somebody else that
[1:42:31] they can see Jesus Christ inside of me.
[1:42:34] And now Paul has been taken off the
[1:42:36] scene many years ago. Many people have
[1:42:39] followed him. Musicians, come please.
[1:42:41] those those of you that are going to
[1:42:43] help with the music. Jesus himself wants
[1:42:47] to live and operate inside of us as it
[1:42:51] did for Paul.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; He wants to live and operate inside of
[1:42:56] you so that you can be as Paul was.
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; Paul's gone.
[1:43:04] He has already gone on to the other
[1:43:06] side. He's a part of the cloud of
[1:43:08] witnesses. He did his job. He left us
[1:43:11] some writings and he didn't want us he
[1:43:13] didn't want us to read this in a surface
[1:43:16] manner. He wanted us to come to
[1:43:18] maturity. He wanted Jesus Christ to be
[1:43:21] seen inside of you.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Inside of me to demonstrate to somebody
[1:43:27] else,
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; I came through the pressing.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; I came through the afflictions. I came
[1:43:35] through the tribulation, the
[1:43:37] afflictions, the the the sufferings. I
[1:43:40] came through all of the things that were
[1:43:42] put in my path. It was not because the
[1:43:45] Lord wanted to kill me. It is because
[1:43:47] the Lord wanted me to die.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; He wanted ME TO DIE TO SELF. HE WANTED
[1:43:54] ME TO DIE TO AMBITIONS. HE WANTED ME TO
[1:43:58] DIE to everything that was unlike the
[1:44:01] world. He wanted me to die. And so this
[1:44:05] pressing has come to me.
[1:44:08] I read one last quote from 1955. Water
[1:44:11] from the rock. Could you imagine all the
[1:44:13] waters in the world packed into a stand
[1:44:17] pipe about this big around? I have no
[1:44:20] idea what size that was.
[1:44:23] IT WOULD GO A THOUSAND AND THOUSANDS OF
[1:44:25] MILES THROUGH the air. And how the
[1:44:27] pressure of that water coming down,
[1:44:29] pressing down, trying to find one little
[1:44:32] crevice to get out. That's the way the
[1:44:35] love of God and the healing power is
[1:44:39] trying to pour in this meeting today.
[1:44:43] Trying its best everywhere. God trying
[1:44:46] to make his way into a heart with all
[1:44:49] that pressure of divine love and will
[1:44:52] and everything trying to press his way
[1:44:56] into the people.
[1:44:58] So friends, as we're coming to a close
[1:45:02] here today, I want you to stand to your
[1:45:04] feet. I want you to go away with
[1:45:06] something. And that is the pressing
[1:45:10] that you're feeling
[1:45:13] is not because God is trying to squash
[1:45:15] you like a bug.
[1:45:18] I want you to go away with a joy in your
[1:45:22] heart that it is God pressing into you.
[1:45:26] He is pressing in with his love. And the
[1:45:29] pressing is in essence pressing out all
[1:45:32] of those critters that like to hide in
[1:45:34] the dark.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; The pressing is coming because he wants
[1:45:39] his divine nature to be in us. He wants
[1:45:43] his divine nature to be working so much
[1:45:46] in us
[1:45:48] until that people don't see
[1:45:53] brother Gley. Amen.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; Remember when Jesus was standing among
[1:46:00] them and one of the disciples said,
[1:46:03] "Show us the father."
[1:46:07] And Jesus says, "Have I been so long
[1:46:09] with you and you still don't know who I
[1:46:12] am?"
[1:46:17] Say, "Preacher,
[1:46:18] that's a pretty big and bold statement
[1:46:20] to to throw out there.
[1:46:26] Well, friends,
[1:46:28] if I'm to be like him,
[1:46:31] if I'm to have his nature, his
[1:46:33] character,
[1:46:36] I'm to be acting like him, performing. I
[1:46:39] mean, isn't this what we've been hearing
[1:46:41] preached?
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Messiah,
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; these signs shall follow them that
[1:46:48] believe. Amen.
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; In my name.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; I wear his name.
[1:46:56] IT'S NOT JUST SO I CAN HAVE A SIGNATURE.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; I wear his name because he wants ME TO
[1:47:02] BE JUST LIKE HIM.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; So these pressings are to press out
[1:47:08] all of the things that are unlike him.
[1:47:13] Bow your heads with me. Father,
[1:47:16] I thank you that you are good and
[1:47:20] merciful
[1:47:21] and kind.
[1:47:23] I thank you, Lord, that you have such a
[1:47:25] love for us that we can come today and
[1:47:30] in everything we can give thanks
[1:47:33] because you're working in us such a
[1:47:36] beautiful, beautiful thing, your very
[1:47:39] own life.
[1:47:42] I thank you, Father,
[1:47:44] for all that you have allowed me to go
[1:47:47] through along with these your people.
[1:47:51] I want to thank you that I'm seeing more
[1:47:53] of Jesus in your people.
[1:47:57] And I'm trusting they're seeing more of
[1:47:59] you in me,
[1:48:02] God. It is because we want you to get
[1:48:05] the glory.
[1:48:07] We're not trying to boast of ourselves.
[1:48:10] We're not trying to receive praise for
[1:48:13] ourselves.
[1:48:14] We only long, Lord, that you get praise
[1:48:18] and honor and glory.
[1:48:22] Let these words now be sealed in by the
[1:48:26] power
[1:48:28] of the Holy Spirit
[1:48:31] in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus
[1:48:33] Christ.
[1:48:36] Of times the day seems long, [singing]
[1:48:42] our trials
[1:48:45] hard
[1:48:46] to bear.
[1:48:49] We're tempted
[1:48:52] to
[1:48:53] complain,
[1:48:56] to murmur
[1:48:59] and despair.
[1:49:03] But Christ will soon
[1:49:07] appear
[1:49:10] to catch his bride
[1:49:14] away.
[1:49:18] All tears
[1:49:20] forever
[1:49:22] over.
[1:49:25] In God's
[1:49:27] eternal
[1:49:29] day, it will be worth it all. [singing]
[1:49:38] When we see Jesus,
[1:49:45] life trials will seem so small
[1:49:52] when we see Christ.
[1:49:59] One glimpse of his dear face.
[1:50:06] All sorrows
[1:50:09] will
[1:50:10] erase
[1:50:12] [music] so bravely
[1:50:16] run the race
[1:50:20] till we see Christ.
[1:50:26] I want us to sing this chorus again
[1:50:32] and I want us not to put it so much in a
[1:50:34] future day when we get into that
[1:50:37] glorious land just beyond this veil.
[1:50:41] But I believe
[1:50:44] that we in
[1:50:47] our lifetime
[1:50:50] will recognize I am recognizing I don't
[1:50:54] know about you but I am recognizing now
[1:50:57] that these trials this pressure is worth
[1:51:01] it.
[1:51:04] I'm recognizing
[1:51:06] that these trials are seeming smaller
[1:51:10] and smaller because I'm getting a
[1:51:12] glimpse.
[1:51:14] I'm getting a glimpse in you. I'm even
[1:51:17] getting a glimpse in me.
[1:51:20] Seeing Jesus,
[1:51:22] the nature, the character of Jesus.
[1:51:25] PREACHER, AREN'T YOU GOING a little too
[1:51:27] far? Pressing this thing a little too
[1:51:29] far. saying about little Jesus is, "Oh
[1:51:32] no, friend.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; I THINK THAT WE HAVE HELD the reigns for
[1:51:37] way too long.
[1:51:40] &gt;&gt; I think that we have held back way too
[1:51:42] LONG IN DESCRIBING WHAT THE BRIDAL
[1:51:46] COMPANY IS going to look like in the end
[1:51:48] time. I think we have made it much too
[1:51:51] small.
[1:51:54] WE HAVE HELD BACK AFRAID OF WHAT PEOPLE
[1:51:57] WOULD SAY ABOUT US AND ABOUT OUR
[1:52:00] DOCTRINE AND ABOUT OUR THEOLOGY. BUT
[1:52:02] FRIENDS, I am seeing more and more that
[1:52:05] the LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST IN THE BRIDAL
[1:52:08] COMPANY IN the end time is the only way
[1:52:11] that we're going to make an exit out of
[1:52:13] here.
[1:52:15] The only way THAT THE BRIDE IS GOING TO
[1:52:18] TAKE A RAPTURE is that she is going to
[1:52:20] have to take on the nature, the
[1:52:23] character of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; He told us that we DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
[1:52:31] FAITH HARDLY FOR a headache.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT TO HAVE MY FAITH INCREASED. AND
[1:52:37] HOW IS MY FAITH GOING TO INCREASE? I'M
[1:52:39] SEEING PEOPLE THAT ARE CLIMBING MOUNT
[1:52:42] ZION AND THEY'RE TAKING on more of THE
[1:52:45] LORD JESUS CHRIST AND IT'S PUTTING
[1:52:47] SOMETHING IN MY FAITH. IF HE CAN DO IT,
[1:52:49] IF SHE CAN DO IT, I CAN DO IT.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; I feel the the uncction OF THE HOLY
[1:52:56] GHOST ON the inside saying, "If they can
[1:53:00] make it that far,
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; I can.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; So I don't have to put this all in a
[1:53:06] future day."
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. He's making it worth it
[1:53:09] right now.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; He's letting us see
[1:53:17] himself.
[1:53:19] Sing this chorus with me once again. It
[1:53:22] will be worth it all
[1:53:28] when we see Jesus.
[1:53:34] [snorts]
[1:53:36] Life's [music] trials will seem so small
[1:53:42] when we see Christ.
[1:53:49] One glimpse of his dear face
[1:53:56] all sorrow
[1:53:59] will
[1:54:01] erase.
[1:54:04] So bravely
[1:54:06] run the race
[1:54:10] till we see Christ one more time.
[1:54:17] It will be worth it all. Do you have
[1:54:23] something?
[1:54:25] When we see Jesus,
[1:54:31] life's trials will seem so small.
[1:54:36] [singing]
[1:54:38] When we see Christ,
[1:54:45] one glimpse
[1:54:47] of his dear face
[1:54:52] all sorrow
[1:54:55] will
[1:54:56] erase.
[1:54:59] So bravely
[1:55:02] run the race
[1:55:06] till we see Christ.
[1:55:16] Let's worship the Lord.
[1:55:22] We worship
[1:55:25] the poor.
[1:55:31] I feel [singing] the pain.
[1:55:38] I hear the call
[1:55:44] [singing]
[1:55:46] and I know [music] his spirit
[1:55:50] move in me [singing]
[1:55:52] to give my all.
[1:55:59] He speaks to me
[1:56:04] [music]
[1:56:06] and I
[1:56:14] Lord please come and take control.
[1:56:20] I feel the poor. [music] Sing that.
[1:56:27] I feel the
[1:56:31] [music]
[1:56:33] I hear the call. [singing]
[1:56:41] And I know his [singing and music]
[1:56:44] spirits
[1:56:46] me to give my all. [singing]
[1:56:54] He [music] speaks [singing] to me
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; and [singing] I
[1:57:03] agree.
[1:57:06] [music]
[1:57:08] Lord, [singing]
[1:57:09] please come and take control.
[1:57:15] I [music] feel the poor
[1:57:19] [singing]
[1:57:22] at night. I [singing] lay in bed
[1:57:26] and I begin
[1:57:30] to cry.
[1:57:35] And my [singing] mind just fails to
[1:57:40] [music] know
[1:57:42] exactly
[1:57:43] [singing] why
[1:57:48] I can't [music and singing] explain
[1:57:51] with tong.
[1:57:53] or pen.
[1:57:55] The spirit's [singing] groaning
[1:57:58] deep within.
[1:58:02] It must [music and singing] be God
[1:58:05] here in my soul.
[1:58:08] Cuz I feel the [singing] poor.
[1:58:13] [music]
[1:58:15] I feel [singing] the poor.
[1:58:20] [music]
[1:58:21] I hear [singing]
[1:58:23] the call.
[1:58:29] I know his spirit's [singing]
[1:58:32] moving me [music]
[1:58:35] to give my [singing] all.
[1:58:41] He speaks to [singing] me [music]
[1:58:48] and I
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, Lord Jesus.
[1:58:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, [singing]
[1:58:56] please come and take control. [music]
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, I feel the power.
[1:59:06] [music]
[1:59:08] I went [singing] to hear the word
[1:59:13] and with each [singing] line and phrase
[1:59:21] he [music] he was drawing
[1:59:24] me to live [singing]
[1:59:27] a higher
[1:59:29] praise. [music]
[1:59:34] There's a deep
[1:59:37] call to [singing] the deep.
[1:59:41] Like a great magnet [singing] pulling
[1:59:45] me.
[1:59:47] I know for sure
[1:59:51] I'll reach the goal. [singing]
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Cuz I feel the poor.
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; Sing with him.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; I feel the poor.

[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; I hear the call.
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord, [music] for the
[2:00:12] call. [singing]
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; I know his spirit's
[2:00:17] moving
[2:00:18] me [singing]
[2:00:20] to give my all.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; He [music] speaks to me
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; and I
[2:00:36] [singing]
[2:00:40] Lord please come and take [singing]
[2:00:44] control.
[2:00:46] I feel the pull. [singing] Let's do
[2:00:49] verse two.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; Sing the verse. Second verse again.
[2:00:51] [music]
[2:00:54] I went to [singing] hear the word
[2:00:57] and with each life
[2:01:01] and praise
[2:01:04] [music]
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; he was drawing [singing] me to give a
[2:01:12] higher
[2:01:14] praise. [singing]
[2:01:19] There's a deep [singing]
[2:01:22] call to the deep
[2:01:25] like a great magnet pulling
[2:01:30] me.

[2:02:10] He speaks [singing and music]
[2:02:12] to me
[2:02:16] and I
[2:02:24] Lord please come and take control.
[2:02:30] I fill the hole. [singing]
[2:02:37] Lord, please come [singing]
[2:02:40] and take control. [music]
[2:02:43] I feel the [singing] P.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, as we're worshiping together,
[2:02:58] Our
[2:03:00] heart's desire
[2:03:03] is this pull that we feel
[2:03:07] that our lives would give
[2:03:11] a higher praise.
[2:03:14] Not the praise of men
[2:03:18] but our life demonstrating Jesus in the
[2:03:21] earth
[2:03:23] would bring a great praise to you.
[2:03:29] Hear our hearts today
[2:03:32] as we are once again giving our [music]
[2:03:34] all.
[2:03:41] I feel [singing] the poor.
[2:03:48] I hear the call. [singing]
[2:03:56] I know his spirit's
[2:03:59] moving
[2:04:00] me to give my all.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Hear the [singing] call of the spirit.
[2:04:09] He speaks to me. [singing and music]
[2:04:13] Hear his voice and agree with it. And I
[2:04:23] [snorts] Lord, please come and [singing]
[2:04:26] take control. [music]
[2:04:29] I feel the poor.
[2:04:40] We worship you, Lord.
[2:04:45] We give praise to the worthy lamb
[2:04:51] whose life abides in me. [music]
[2:04:57] And we're thankful today, Lord, that
[2:05:01] we are in
[2:05:05] the position as John the Baptist.
[2:05:11] I must decrease, [snorts]
[2:05:15] he must increase.
[2:05:21] Thank you for it, Lord,
[2:05:25] as we depart this building
[2:05:28] and we
[2:05:30] may experience
[2:05:34] those pressings.
[2:05:38] May we hear the voice of our papa
[2:05:41] echoing back
[2:05:45] these pressings
[2:05:47] are that my life might be seen in you.
[2:05:53] How grateful we are Lord for this
[2:05:55] beautiful and mighty and excellent plan
[2:05:59] that you have
[2:06:04] for the elect lady in the end time.
[2:06:09] We will not grow weary and welloing
[2:06:13] but we walk with the promise that we
[2:06:16] will reap in due time
[2:06:18] if we faint not.
[2:06:21] I pray your blessing on these people
[2:06:23] that are here in this building, those
[2:06:25] that are watching this service or those
[2:06:28] that may watch in archive. I am asking
[2:06:31] God that you would let the blessing of
[2:06:36] our Lord be upon them.
[2:06:40] The very life of Jesus
[2:06:42] may be seen in them.
[2:06:49] We will not manufacture it, Lord.
[2:06:53] We will let the light dispel the
[2:06:55] darkness.
[2:06:57] Every crevice,
[2:07:00] every place made bare so that there are
[2:07:03] no creeping things left.
[2:07:06] Only Jesus will be seen in us.
[2:07:12] Lord, as we've come to the close of this
[2:07:14] service, my mind
[2:07:17] goes to
[2:07:19] our sister Donna Steel
[2:07:23] was in the hospital last night
[2:07:26] with an affliction. And I pray God that
[2:07:28] you will minister to her
[2:07:31] even this day.
[2:07:34] She and Brother Gary wanted to be in the
[2:07:36] service, but a
[2:07:39] a health issue arose. I pray father for
[2:07:43] their divine healing to be manifest in
[2:07:46] their physical bodies.
[2:07:49] In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we
[2:07:51] pray.
[2:07:53] Amen.
[2:07:57] You're dismissed to go as you wish to
[2:07:59] today. I want to thank you for being
[2:08:01] here in the house of the Lord with us.
[2:08:04] We'll have service again here on Tuesday
[2:08:06] night at 7 o'clock.
[2:08:12] I feel his presence close by and I'm
[2:08:14] thankful for it.
[2:08:18] Oneful,
[2:08:21] wonderful
[2:08:24] Jesus.
[2:08:27] [singing]
[2:08:31] He is my friend,
[2:08:35] true
[2:08:37] to [singing] the end.
[2:08:41] He gave himself
[2:08:45] to [singing] redeem
[2:08:49] me.
[2:08:52] Jesus,
[2:08:55] wonderful
[2:08:58] Lord. [singing]
[2:09:02] And I've got peace.
[2:09:06] Peace. [singing]

[2:09:28] my spirit
[2:09:31] forever.
[2:09:34] I pray
[2:09:37] in fathomless
[2:09:40] pillows
[2:09:42] of love. [singing]
[2:09:44] Once again
[2:09:47] I've got peace.
[2:09:51] Peace.
[2:09:54] Wonderful
[2:09:56] peace [music]
[2:09:59] coming down
[2:10:01] from the father
[2:10:04] above.

[2:10:13] my spirit
[2:10:15] forever.
[2:10:18] I pray
[2:10:21] in [music] fathomless
[2:10:24] billows
[2:10:27] of love. [singing]
