November to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Tucson Tabernacle and she was there and sung that night and it was such a blessing and these are precious memories sometimes they start ebbing away as

it let's not forget our fellowship uh meetings the the weekend first weekend full weekend of December which would be the 7th and the eth is that right yes December 7th and the eth we're looking for a good time in the Lord he's already got it taken care of doesn't he let's stand go back to the word let's thank God for these musicians or be no need to sing [Applause] again what great worship we had and I enjoyed that new song that we sung there at the end a little hard to learn sometime a new song but I thought it was just so appropriate for the hour that we're walking through right now to look back one of these days and know that God was winning every Victory and and and and the main thing Benjamin sent that to me this week was having a particularly difficult day uh one of three that I had and uh he sent me that song in a text he said Dad I know it's not your style of of music but he said I think you'll appreciate the words and boy did I ever I just spent the rest of the afternoon just declaring God you didn't fail you did not fail you never fail you cannot fail it's not in you to fail and we need to remember that sometime when things don't turn out the way we want them to or the way we expect them to God is not to blame he never fails he always makes decisions that are right and we will trust him no matter what AM amen uh let's turn this morning are you ready for the word can you give it your full attention Proverbs chapter 4 I want to read uh between verses 23 and and 27 verses 23- 27 keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it the heart are the issues of life life flows out of the heart is that okay to to to just emphasize put away from thee a frower mouth first of all Proverbs has addressed a father to a son has addressed guarding the heart keeping the heart now he's talking about the mouth put away from the award mouth and perverse lips put far from from thee let thine eyes look right on does anybody understand that language let our eyes be focused forward and let thine eyelids look straight before thee if we were going to paraphrase that this morning we would say don't look to the right don't look to the left but keep your eyes straight ahead on the the prize the prize is not a mansion it's not streets of gold it's not a place where the candle is not needed but but the S so n is the light but the goal is Jesus to be with him for all eternity our present goal is that he be formed in us even now and father is talking to son in Proverbs and he is is saying to him you must guard your heart because out of your heart your life flows you've got to watch your frow mouth you've got to put perverse lips far away from you he said Ponder the path of thy feet and let all thy ways read that for me let all thy ways be established turn not to the right hand he repeats himself he gives it a different language but says the same thing turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from Evil this is not only the instructions of a father to a son in Old Testament times but it is instructions from a father to a son in New Testament times if if you believe that say amen amen you may be S be seated there is a an inspirational speaker who uh has had some influence over my life in some of his writings he writes also about journaling and about time management and and about priorities and about getting it done and about not procrastinating does anybody have a problem with procrastination and uh he talks a lot about it and has even developed the system but you you have to be quite disciplined to follow through on his system his name is Michael hayatt and he made this statement I don't know if I gave it to charity or not but he made this statement that really really says a lot to me it says if your heart is unhealthy and we're not talking about the blood pump we're talking about Le l in Hebrew and that is the seat of the mo of the emotions it is the mind it's not in the chest after all but it is symbolized in scripture to the blood pump the heart but we find that our mind does not uh it it doesn't exist in our blood pump it actually exists in our brain but spiritually the heart can be summarized as the mind he said if your heart your mind is unhealthy it threatens everything else can anybody see that family friends career we could go on on choices everything I like this so much that I made it a point to put it in my notes and when I started searching for the heart health because of a dream that I had that was the first note that came up in the search o of my own personal notes if your heart is let's read it out loud together if your heart is unhealthy it threatens everything else family friend 's career everything I like that it's very true in Genesis chapter 2 stay with me this morning I want to go to verse seven and 8 and the Lord God formed Man Out of the Dust or of the Dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul we're going to call this this morning Above All Else Above All Else guard your heart in verse 8 of Genesis 2 he goes on to say and the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden and there he put the man whom he had formed now we often talk about the Garden of Eden but remember Eden was a larger place than a garden and in Eden it was a land it was a place uh I don't know if you exactly how you would describe it it was uh larger than a town it was a region I think we could say and in the region of Eden God not Adam God planted a garden yes sir now that word planted in the HEB Hebrew is Nat and it means to establish to plant to fasten or to fix so God established a garden he planted a garden he fastened it and fixed it Eastward in the land of Eden are you following me and then the word Eden in Genesis 2:8 is aen which is the feminine part of the word Edan and it means Delight pleasure delicate so we can say that the Garden of Eden or Gan Edan is the garden of delight now God chose that name for a reason he wanted us to understand that his ultimate goal for you and I is that we live in a place of rest in a place of safety and in a place of delight did you know it's one of the basic Cravings of of a of an individual of a human being to have a place of rest to have a community to have something of a safe Zone to live in and we Thrive when we feel safe come on now and I want you to know that we may emphasize sometime our our roaring lion we may emphasize our raging enemy but I want you to know that even in a world gone wild even in Satan's Eden there is a place of safety there is a place of rest there is a place of pleasure and of delight and it is in Christ and it is only in Christ and it's not being in Christ in word only or or in in language that comes out of our mouth but it's really when the rubber meets the road that we can testify I'm so hidden in Christ that the waves are not going to take me out I'm I'm anchored to the Rock of Ages I'm planted myself in a place of rest in a place of pleasure in a place of delight so come what may I know who's I am is that okay you see the first purpose that God gave to Adam in in this land and in this Garden of Gan Eden was that he would dress and keep the garden now notice the language dress and keep because Proverbs 4:23 said keep the heart with all diligence it's a very similar word in the Hebrew language the word of instruction that Solomon is passing down to a son the same is the same instruction that God was giving to Adam as he placed him in the Garden of Eden guard the garden keep the garden the father to the son guard the heart keep the heart now why would the heart be likened to a garden because anybody that's ever have had a garden knows it's an endless cycle you can't plant the seed and go back in a few months and get a heart Harvest because things will spring up I need a little help this morning things will spring up overnight yes they will did you know it seems like sometime that weeds grow faster than what you planted and and you can watch their progress almost overnight and we've talked about this numerous times through the years that you even should be careful when you're pulling up a weed that you don't shake any of the seed off because sometimes in our tug of trying to get something out of the garden you see me we we spill some seed some spores that are hiding on the underside of the leaves and they go back into the ground and they become very fertile because you've just given them a fertile place to grow you have broken up the ground that's now you've shaken some loose seeds in and what you're doing is you're reproducing your problem right anybody with me so now you don't have one weed in the way you've got an innumerable number of weeds getting ready to spring up so you've got to let them spring up you'll never chase them out by trying to get a magnifying glass and find them but you'll have to let them spring up before you can uproot them and so to guard and to keep is a full-time job it's it's what the scripture says we should remember above all else I want you to say With Me Above All Else else above all else it is my responsibility say that it is my not my husbands not my wives not my pastors not my children not presidents not governors not doctors not lawyers it above all things it is my responsibility to guard my garden to guard my heart now this sprung out of a dream or an experience that I had on the evening of September the 4th and when I woke up on September the fifth I wrote it down I went to the chair I took my laptop and I transcribed the dream that I had and in this dream there was a person a person that I recognized I'm going to try to leave it gender nutral because it doesn't really matter if it was a man or a woman it was just a person a human being someone that I knew someone that I loved someone that I cared about there was something going on on like a it it wasn't exactly like a foot race it was kind of more like a Spartan competition or something like that because there were there were obstacle type uh events or courses that were set up around the field it was around field but it wasn't just running track there were some hurdles to jump over and and there was eventually toward the very end of that uh racetrack there was a wall that had to be climbed I noticed because I was sort of sitting in the in the bleachers looking down over the race and I did see a few other people in the competition but my focus was on the person that I recognized the one I knew and this person had done very well getting around the track I I was actually amazed I said oh my this you know this person has lost weight and they're more fit it looks like this is you know I never thought I'd be here for my friend watching this person compete in a in a competition or something like this a and as they came as as this person came to the last part of that competition there was a wall as I mentioned that had to be scaled it had to be climbed and and the person had to make their way down the other side but it was quite high and jumping was probably not the best you know jumping all the way down was probably not the best solution I noticed that it wasn't like a rock climbing wall there were no places particularly in the wall to put your feet so you were going to have to depend on sheer strength to not only climb but to adhere like Spiderman so to speak forgive the refence to the wall to be able to get over the wall to the other side I watched this individual uh do quite well time and time and time again but each and every time as that person would get to the top part of the wall even one time so close to the top that the person began to sort of lift their leg like they were going to try to find some inertia to to ort of uh haul themselves hurl themselves over the top but each time they begin to slip down the wall slide down the wall most of the time collapsing at the bottom the last time the person fell quite hard on their back and it looked as though the wind had been knocked out of them and the word of the Lord came in this experience and said tell this person by my name whatever you do guard your heart this was to be the word of the Lord to that person and for some reason it seemed in the dream or experience to be directly related to the fact that all of these times they had tried to get over the wall and yet something had kept uh causing them to fall to collapse as a puddle or a heap at the bottom and then the last time as I mentioned it looked like even the wind was knocked out of them and it didn't maybe seem like an appropriate word of the Lord to deliver in a situation like that but I believe the Lord was saying the reason why there's such a struggle to get over this thing you see that's why I want to just leave it genderless and I want to leave it nameless because in reality I've actually spoken to the person that it was about but you can think it was you if you want to I maybe shouldn't have even said that because then I won't have any text this afternoon asking me was it me was it me was it me was it me was it me I should have just left it like it was but I did actually speak to the person that it was about but the reality is every one of us have got a hurdle every one of us have got a wall to get over and the the reality is no matter how much weight we've lost or how how healthier we get or or how more fit we get we don't have within ourselves what it takes to get over the last wall to win the prize if we do it it's going to be because of the help and the grace of God and we can't even depend on him if our heart is not right we expect God to bless us because we go to church we expect God to bless us because we pay our tithe we expect God to bless us because we say we believe the message but the reality is we can become quite clean on the outside but the but the reality is that there are issues there are flows that are coming out of us because our heart has not been properly guarded now some of you seem extremely drowsy this morning and I'm only going to say this once I'm talking to you you in fact are the one that I'm talking to this morning and I feel again that I'm not here to just give you a little sermon but I'm here to give you something perhaps the word of the Lord for where you are right now you're going to keep falling again and again and again you're going to have the wind knocked out of you again and again and again until you discover what's growing in your garden until you discover what's coming into your heart what you have allowed to grow in your inner man if I were to ask you the question which is the most important part of who we are outer man or inner man of course it's the inner man because it's out of the inner man that everything else flows IT issues forth we can have some fun with this word issues because in the in the in the na in the original language I'll show you in a moment it's both referring to something that issues out that that flows out like water from a from a from a tap but it's also a word that can be used for life's issues like jealousy Envy bitterness unforgiveness hatred oh my let's get together let's get together because I've got a feeling that the Lord if he hasn't already I've got a feeling that the Lord is about to help you do some gardening and I want you to know that if you got if you've got any smarts at all and I believe you do then you will get busy and anticipate his arrival because once he gets to your garden brother he's going to deal with the toughest stuff he's going to deal with that which has roots that go all the way back to your childhood because he wants to walk with you in the cool of the day in your garden he wants to have fellowship and he walks with me and he talks with me the song is called in the garden and we think it's talking about somebody's flower bushes but in reality it's talking about the garden of the Inner Man and when I hear the scripture say above all I believe it means just that above all when we sing the chorus above all powers above all names Above All Creatures above all created things I think that's what it means above aou L all all means all that's all that's so more than your skirt length which some of you could use a little help some of you just flat out need a bigger size all the way around because you've got too many curves that are moving and shaking but above that above your hair come on on above a a brother how he lives in his job and how he refuses dirty jokes and how his language shouldn't be like like the world listen if you have a Leo de and vocabulary you may need somebody to wash your mouth out with soap because there are certain things that are not curse words but they are vulgar and they are uh pop culture and they smack of the world around us and they don't sound like holy ghost filled people they don't sound like redeemed sons of God there are things that we say that do not sound like Christians it sounds like Instagram and it sounds like Facebook and it sounds like texting uh uh uh you know lol's and what do you call those not emojis uh abbreviations or something like that of laugh out loud and rolling on the floor laughing and OMG I hope that means oh my goodness because it would be a unchristian to say oh my God in that kind of context that wouldn't be like a Christian Christian wouldn't talk like that you understand what I'm saying because that's using the name of God which is not a name but it's using the office of God in vain when we use the name of God it should be to praise him or to call on him because we need his help it shouldn't be his slang come on brother sister but above all that Above All Above the fact that some of us could be a little more faithful in our tithing above all what does all mean all it's all it means all there's nothing else left when you say above all the scripture says above all guard your not your closet your heart not your career your heart not your family above all Say it With Me Above All Else guard your heart because out of your heart heart are the issues of life it's powerful powerful powerful scripture verses in Genesis 2:15 he said and the Lord God took the man and put p u t put when I see the word put in a complicated sentence like this I'm taking back to my pre-reading days or my early reading days See Spot Run I think immediately of Dick and Jane because the word put is a small word that was often used in Dick and Jane See Jane put the book on the table now this was not first first dick and readers this is moving up a little bit but put put the cat down put seems like such a small little word in this verse for such a a a serious and complicated and even complex truth but it says and the Lord God took the man and put him that word put is actually a much bigger word in Hebrew it it it's the word yanak and it means to rest and the Lord God took the man and rested him into the Garden of Eden it means to allow to bestow and even more importantly we combine the meanings to settle down and remain God put the man we now know his name was Adam which means of the red Earth God put Adam he placed him he rested him he allowed him he was bestowing something on him to put him there and he expected him to settle down and remain so the Garden of Eden is a place that God expects you and I to find and to remain there it's a garden of delight it's a place of Joy how many of you know how important it is to find a place of Joy the enemy comes every day to knock you out of your garden he comes every day to take you out of Joy he comes every day to take you out of rest pastor's preaching now he comes every day to take you out of your place of comfort Fort the place where you have fellowship with him it it isn't that that Satan cares where you live geographically it's not that at all but he doesn't like it when your heart is at rest because remember the heart is the mind and the mind is closer related to the soul than it is the spirit now I know there's going to be those who hear this who have it a little bit different and and and so I would just say it depends on on whether you believe that it is Body Spirit Soul or Body Soul spirit I have to do what the prophet told me to do since he said it both ways if we find brother brandom saying Hell is eternal and hell is not Eternal if we find brother brandom saying God is a trinity and God is not a trinity can I give you should I give you some more do you need some more th this is like a workbook for me this is like good exercise for me because then I have to say which one of these hear this which one of these fits the absolute they both can't be the absolute that's God cannot be an absolute Trinity and absolute not a trinity hell cannot absolutely be Eternal and it can't be absolutely not Eternal at the same time it's got to be one to the other so guess what we were told to do take it back to the prophet's quotebook which is the Bible That's you don't often hear saying like I said the other day in paragraph 11 page 9 on 1963 but he did tell us what is written it is written he did tell us chapter and verse because it's chapter and verse that we build our lives on because men are in a place of progressive revelation but God has never had a further revelation of anything he's never had a further thought he thought all of his thoughts originally and now he just rethinks them he just revisits them brain science tells us that if we would spend more time revisiting our positive healthy thoughts than we do our negative thoughts that eventually the negative thoughts would burn up there are brain scans that you can find on YouTube that will show you what it looks like when a when a portion of a dendrite ceases to exist it just sort of flashes a little light and it's poof it's gone you can't revisit that unless someone says something or you read something or you see something that causes that to come come to you then it starts rewriting it right back into the recesses not of just your spiritual man but of your natural physical real estate the real estate of your brain uh this is an amazing gift that God has given us I don't have to think about every move that I'm going to make and everything that I'm going to do through the day I develop a routine I develop a habit and as long as I stay with that I'm okay because my brain will prompt me without language to do what is next but if I fill up my brain I'm not going to stay here long but if I fill up my brain with negative energy thoughts they make those twisted if you've ever seen pictures of dendrites you know know that there are some that look healthy like the tree of life and there are those that look twisted and gnarled this is science now I'm not making this up twisted and gnarled like Sleepy Hollow trees you understand what I mean like haunted haunted picture trees Twisted ugly trees you isn't it crazy to think you've got some ugly trees growing here here you and I have been given the privilege to eat from the Tree of Life and yet we choose to keep going back and revisiting he said she said he did she did I'm going to preach to you now because Above All Else guard your heart you want to get over the mountain you want to get over the uh you want to get to the top of the mountain you want to get over the wall above all else well I need to pray more you do I need to read the Bible more you do I need to hear the message more you do but above all else you better put a Watchman on the wall of your heart because your mind will and emotions is where the enemy is going to fight you day in in and day out he's going to fight you in the Battlefield of the Mind which is the heart it's the heart that's where he's going to fight you if you are recently recovering from an addiction he's going to try to drag you back into that addiction because your brain has been wrongly wired to believe you did it you did it I did it we have wrongly wired our brain to believe that this is the only piece we have a joint this kind not the beer joint we have wired ourselves and you know we have excuses to go with it why there are some states where it's legal and there are dispensaries and and and they and you know even answer patience and we say all of these kinds of things not taking note that science is getting clearer every day that it's going to be a a a win lose situation if you get hooked on the stuff even though it's a plant it's going to be a win- lose situation because you are going to destroy brain cells over a period of time of which they're finding out you may never be able to regrow you may never be able to re uh to replace the cells that you have damaged because it's not the plant it's the smoking of the plant it's the burning of the plant it's the inhaling the plant that is causing people's bodies so much damage somebody said I quit smoking cigarettes and so I I do these ecigarettes what do they call them Vapes so that means you're afraid to use a little essential oil on your finger God forbid you'd put it in your mouth like I do every day but you're willing to inhale chemicals that go right down into the lungs and start immediately immediately deforming the cells that it touches because your lungs weren't made to come in contact on a regular basis with those man-made chemicals so those things attach themselves are you here attach themselves to the very cells of your lungs and as soon as they do damage is caused now that's no problem because cells become damaged every day they fall off and new cells appear here's where the problem lies in things like alcohol and things like nicotine and things like chemicals from Vapes and and even the smoking of the marijuana and the and the on and and even too much sugar for the food addicts these things not only damage cells but they start working on the DNA of the cell sir and the RNA and if you're not careful what happens in most most cases is when that cell goes to be replaced because there's been damage the cell that replaces it can you guess it's a damaged cell it's not a whole cell it's not the cell like you had before you damaged it it's what we call a mutated cell and guess what it's going to multiply and reproduce itself and guess what the next one's going to be mutated and the next one is going to M be mutated and depending on what kind of cell it is it's going to end up being a tumor and depending on what kind of tumor it is it may be something that takes your breath or it may be something that takes your life you see the enem is a liar you don't have to have those things to get by you've just got to guard your heart and you can't guard it until you clean it you've got to discover what it is that's growing in your heart that's causing you not to be able to get over the wall you need to discover what's growing in your heart that takes you back to the pornography that takes you back to the self-pleasure that takes you back to whatever it is Sir that's keeping you from overcoming remember there is an overcoming bride that is being raised up in this hour it doesn't matter how many give up it doesn't matter how many lay down there's going to be some that refuse to give up because they have recognized by Revelation the reason why they were born you weren't here to be come a a a dump for chemicals you're not here to become a dump for whatever it is that the enemy is sending against you whether it's a physical stimulant or whether it's an emotional stimulant if it's not bringing you closer to Christ that's right somebody said I don't even know how to get rid of these things well the first thing you need to do is separate it from its Life Source that's not a bad idea when you're dealing with things like honeysuckle vines in the natural they're a mess they're a mess but you know you can do a little bit better with them if you'll cut some of them and let them die then you can haul them out and you can go back in not too close to the root now because you need to be able to go back in and find where they are you see this is the way it works you've got to separate whatever that is and I may get very personal so I hope that you are awake because if I ask you a question you're going to look dumb if you're snoring how can someone watch a two-hour movie never doze hello but you let the preacher get a little too close for comfort and you'd be surprised how drowsy you get come on now it's just we can say that it's this I've had it all I've it's all been sent to me in the past I've got it all I've read it all I've seen it all but the reality is it depends on what Zeal you come with it depends on where your loyalty is is it to your employer more or is it to your own spiritual life there comes a time where we've got to find what it is that really matters because husband can't do it for you and wife can't do it for you and pastors can't do it for you but Above All Else you've got to guard your heart you've got to guard your mind yes sir I believe that it's what the scripture says it's Body Soul and Spirit or Spirit soul and Body Soul in the middle because the spirit of God breathed life into Adam who was a physical body made from the red Earth of Eden and it was nothing but a physical body until the Breath of God came in it and when the breath of Spirit came in it the scriptures clear Man became a living Soul he was Spirit first he was body first but when spirit and body came together he was given a soul and that soul is not your enemy that soul is where your victory has to be that soul is the Battleground the mind is the Battleground it's not not your enemy it's only the arena it's only the venue where the battle rages but blessed be the name of the Lord It's where the battle rages that the victory is born it's where the battle is Raging that Jesus the Victor can come and be Lord he wants to be Lord he wants to be your leader he doesn't want you to be led by smut he doesn't want you to be led by Vanity it's a false Doctrine to teach that that having deodorant on is is sin or Pride that's a false Doctrine I reject that while anti persin is certainly not good for you you can find something that smells better than pure old bo body odor that doesn't make you holy it makes you repulsive so if you're sitting here this morning and you think you're so holy because you stink you came out of the old school that's right I'm glad I graduated from that kind of problem so while you're worried about not putting on a little mum or a little bit of deodorant to cut down on your stench there's something worse than that growing in your heart we're jealous and envious of one another but we wouldn't dare want to smell good because that would be vanity hello we wouldn't dare want to match our clothes you know because brother brandom said well it didn't matter you know I just wear a coat and a pair of pants and so for it doesn't really matter you know just a pair of serious sucker bres that I can press on the backseat of my automobile and so forth but let me tell you something you're not living in the 1950s any longer you're living in 2020 and it matters how you present yourself to the world around you because you are ambassadors of the Lord Jesus Christ how you treat your landlord matters how you treat your employees matters how you slop to Walmart matters woo I hear some preaching going on here because you're not just representing Jernigan family or Shelly family or McFarland family or Yantis F you're representing the kingdom of God the God of all gods the one who is Holy the one who matters so please don't get caught up in whether whether or not your sleeve has covered your elbow while you've got ugly stuff you speak to your wife like she's a dog that's ugly stuff you try to sneak around and manipulate your husband to get him to do what you want him to do that's ugly stuff on I believe you're less likely to get to heaven with that growing in your heart than if you were to show your elbow you see how the enemy gets everything out of whack that's why God had to call us even out of the Holiness movement that's why God had to even call us out of Pentecost as a movement as a denomination not that the experience is wrong not that Living Clean and holy and separated is wrong but it's like the prophet tells us they they come along to a certain thing and they put a period there soon as the Pentecostal started jabbering in tongues they said we've got the fullness well the Bible tells us that that is not the fullness the fullness is the seal what we get so excited over is just the earnest we get excited over the one infilling and the many refilling but it's something even more than that promise to the overcoming redeemed of the Lord and that is that we step into that place where we are sin until the day until the day of Redemption come on I'm disturbed about their Christmas trees and all the other Pagan idols and things that they get so excited about even around this message their their their weddings their their cleavage that these girls show at their wedding day you you I understand the con ction between cleavage and weddings that should be on the wedding night I understand that that's what the husband has been wanting to see I get all of that I understand the chemistry of the human man but in front of God and everybody never wore Powder and Paint mascara and ey Shadow and all that until the wedding day don't have time to take your call Brother wherever you're from somewhere in Africa God bless you little busy why in the world do these girls want to want to put on that kind of a thing on the day that matters so much you've already got him so you're not doing it for him who are you doing it for the photographer you you're doing it for social media I think I'm going to dye my hair I'm getting married that's not going to change who you are you're just fixing up the old barn but it's the inside it's the manure on the inside of your barn that we need to be most most Above All Else concerned about in this hour amen you don't want to get me on those things those outward things they don't matter as much as the inward but they matter they matter because if one generation lets down the bars if one generation lets down the guard the Old Guard dies and the Next Generation swallows whatever works and that's why you've got fath Facebook full of message Believers with their little children dressed up with their little Jackal lanterns going door to door they think they've got so much Revelation on the word but they're so stupid that they can't see evil lurking at the [Applause] door we'll just dress our children up and take them right down to the very places of this world show in the customs of the Heathen for you it may be an innocent piece of uh Jolly Rancher candy but it's not you that we're worried about it's what it represents and here's where we're going to go in a minute it's what it opens our lives up to my old granny shouldn't have been a preacher woman but she was and until she heard better but she had some pretty good sense and she said it's not the first pain it's not the first fifth that makes the alcoholic it's not the first drag on a cigarette I mean excuse me it's not the first carton not the first pack but why would you even want to open the door you say somebody's got a pill that'll speed you up make you feel a little bit better I'm not talking about something designed for your health prescribed by a doctor please understand I'm certainly not against medicine I'm on medication now not for my nerves I could use something but for my blood pressure and something else I'm not against medication I was at the doctor this week I sure hate to go I don't go but every 3 months I wouldn't go then if they would refill my prescription but they wouldn't be getting enough money out of me if I didn't have to at least come every 3 months and smile literally I was you know you're 5 minutes everything go yeah any any new complaints Noe want a flu shot no want a want a CO shot no want a want a shot for this no want a shot for that no want a shot for the other no are you depressed well sometime well sounds like everything's okay you know why you're laugh because you had the same experience I'm not against doctors I'm not against medication but I want you to know getting one from your buddy on the street that that's not um that's not a good idea I wasn't even sure whether I wanted to eat a frozen french fry from a bag that that opened up on the way home from the grocery store yesterday we used usually eat real french fries you know real potatoes if we're going to eat them but but for the sake of what what my wife was putting together she got a couple bags of frozen fries and when we went to take it out of the car the the end of it was open I said I don't know if I'm eating that or not let's let's let's cook it extra extra long make it extra crispy make it extra hot then I'm going to pray and sanctify it I don't know what people are doing you don't know what crazy people people are doing in this hour so you're going to take a pill from somebody on your job and swallow it and not know what's going on in your body folks you better be careful with influencers and you better be careful in following Trends and you better be careful huffing uh you know um laundry detergent pods and doing tricks with light bulbs in your mouth and Garling with antifreeze all the things that are cool these things aren't cool excuse me for saying stupid again children don't use the word it's a terrible word you you must be at least 21 to ever use it and that's in rare cases or circumstances but that is just playing out stupid the bigger problem that we're facing as Believers is what's going on inside the garden what's going on inside the heart what's going on inside of the mind and the will and the emotions it matters because it multiplies it matters because it produces itself it matters because it wants to TW twine its way through your life life until it cuts you off from your source which is the Tree of Life unresolved anger bitterness that's never been dealt with resentment that is never been ministered to you've never tried to dig it out so so resentment becomes bitterness and bitterness becomes exclusiveness and inclusion and pulling away and then it becomes hatred and if you've wished harm on someone else you've murdered them if you've told something that hurts someone's influence murder brother Bram say it's like taking a gun to someone it matters what you say it matters what you say so God put him I got to hurry God put him in the garden settled him down to remain at rest and then that word dress in Genesis 215 dress it's avod and it means to till so if anyone tells you that it didn't mean to do any kind of Labor they're wrong if anybody tells you that Adam had nothing else to do in the garden they're wrong he didn't toil but he did dress he did till he did serve he did work he had something to do he had something to keep he had something to cultivate because that word dress means exactly that Genesis 2 15 and the Lord God took the man and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it that word keep is Shamar and it means to keep to guard to observe listen to what else it means it means to give heed it means to preserve and look at what it means it means to watch like a Watchman it's one of the four Hebrew words that's translated to English in the Old Testament for a Watchman one who sits up on the wall one who sits up on the tower is anybody with me and you watch for the enemy to come in you're watching uh in the daylight and you're watching in the night time and you're watching if you can't see in the dark you've got night vision goggles on spiritually and you understand that as a believer that the devil pulls out the stops at night Sir so forgive me for using the word that you shouldn't use under the age of 21 again but it's just kind of stupid to go to bed watching something thing that has no wholesome value at all because sometime that stuff will hang up in your in your subconscious it'll affect your dreams and you'll be going around telling people you had a dream from the Lord about them you'll be influencing and directing someone else's life by an impression or a feeling or a dream that may have come from an imagination that is not completely Sanctified be careful what you share under the pretense of being from the Lord I'll be totally honest with you when someone tells me they have something from the Lord for me I receive it as coming from them first right I just assume in my mind they love me and they want to help me and they want to say something to me either instructive or corrective uh but but you should understand that the corrective forms of prophetic unctions should not be without some sort of judgment so for you to go to one another individually and and with something that is corrective from the Lord is out of order because they're supposed to to be a Watchman on the wall there's supposed to be some judgment involved so be careful leaving the impression that God has spoken this because some of us just seem to believe when people start sharing what's in their heart that they're speaking on behalf of the Lord they may be or they may not be but if you've had as many prophecies Visions dreams unctions feelings Goosebumps hair raising pimple feelings that people have shared with me about me you would eventually get to the place where I am I receive it is from a friend a brother a stranger whatever you are and then I take it to the Lord if it doesn't line up with the Bible it's not from him and if the Lord can't come and say Amen in my spirit it's not from the Lord for me until it is it doesn't mean the vessel is false it doesn't mean the person is false it doesn't mean the gift is false it doesn't make a false prophet it doesn't make a false discerner I'm not talking about that you're my brother or my sister you're not false you're for me but I cannot base my life on something from a friend unless the amen of the holy spirit is on it you'd be surprised how much of my time is filled up with people who come with confusion even around the world but but even in this little house with confusion over things that have been said to them that they have no absolute clue whatsoever where it come from what it means what it meant why it was said so sometimes my friends my brothers my sisters that you love me so much sometimes you make way more work for me than I have deserved sometimes you're putting me in a situation where I can't even give a good answer because I wasn't there I find that our memories are so clogged up anymore the preacher's preaching our memories are so clogged up anymore that I find out that someone you can have a conversation with someone one day and the next day they can't even remember I'm not just talking about old people young people are about as bad or maybe worse because they've got more listen they've got more ADHD than anybody else because that thumb it's that thumb you your problem is in your thumb and your attention span has gotten so short that's when you go to tell somebody tomorrow do you know what she said you may or may not be telling what was said that's right and if you are you're certainly punctuating it with how it made you feel because we have a tendency to remember how we felt all the preachers preaching more than what was said and and so if you go back to the person who was sharing out of the goodness of their heart what they remember and what is remembered by the person that the word was supposed to be delivered to is so diabolically opposite until you never can track down really what was going on in the first place because no one really remembers although they both will often say I know exactly what was said remember that if you're giving some inspiration from the Lord or instruction to somebody the the important the most important thing is for them to be able to understand what you're saying otherwise it's a dream without interpretation if a dream is interpreted it carries the weight of a vision if a message in tongues is interpreted it carries the weight of a prophecy these things matter being understand being able to understand what God is saying what someone is sharing with you from the Lord it matters and if they don't understand what you're saying you've not delivered the message L sometimes we do it for for the sense of let me get this in now before it happens but remember if the person you're speaking to doesn't understand the context of the message that you're delivering they're better off less confused and calling on the Lord amen sometimes we actually have to hold things because we realize that people are not in a frame of mind to receive what the Lord is saying did you know we can put someone in a very vulnerable position a dangerous and vulnerable position by trying to force feed them something that they're not emotionally prepared to hear even advice because their anger their resentment their rejection could accidentally be directed toward God this modern prophetic movement has got this idea that if they reject what I say they've rejected God you're not the only cowboy in the rodeo sir to reject something from a person is not necessarily to reject it from God remember that we're all Sons Papa doesn't just love one of us enough to straighten us out and help us straighten out other people but he loves us each and everyone and he wants to help us all and he wants to direct us all and I just want to tell you this the reality for a lot of us is this we don't need a vision we already know what we're supposed to do we don't need a prophet we already know what we're supposed to do we don't need tongues and interpretation because most of the time we already know what we're supposed to do and the only reason why we stay in listen is because we want to hear the opposite so we can say well so and so told me that I didn't have to do so honey I don't care if president Trump President elect Trump would would te he text me all the time time well he says it is him how how many of you does he text I get texts from him all the time hey Steve this is President Trump I want to see you in Washington hey Steve I have put two gold make America great hats up in your name send 29.95 hey Steve this President Trump I'd like to see you in the in in your job on your job with a trump watch I don't think it's him I if it does he better get busy figuring out how he's going to get us out of the mess we're in and stop texting me about watches most of the time we already have the leading of what we know we should do what we're supposed to do what God is expecting out of us but we're hoping that someone might tell us something else so that we can lay our options out let me tell you something you don't have any options other than the perfect will of God for your life you were born for a purpose for a reason and that's the only option you have it would be better for you to walk the rest of your life alone that's right on than to walk it with the wrong person or out of the mind of God out of the perfect will of God it's important to know and discern the perfect will of God let me tell you something the believer has an amount of discernment built in to their Holy Ghost experience and we need to sharpen that and we need to exercise that but whatever we do we don't need to be looking for the next great word we just need to walk steady because sometimes we get carried out carried away with what season we're in the season of this or the season of that or the season of the other Above All Above All Else even if this is a war season even if this is a rest season even if it's this is a suddenly season even if it above all all else guard your heart because it's out of your heart that your life happens as a man thinketh in his heart most translations make it pler than ours he is as a man thinketh in his heart so he is well that's exactly what the father is saying here to the son guard your heart because out of that out of your heart flow the issues of life is that okay I couldn't deliver a clear word to the person that I saw in this experience until I began to understand so I spent an an an odd amount of time on on bunny Trails of of great proportion but good ones to try to understand what it really means above all else to guard your heart and I want to get to that before I close just a little of it before I close but in order to do that I've got just a minute of a section to finish can I do that in in verse 15 the word used I may have given you this I did the word used in Hebrew it's 108 the word used in Hebrew for work is the same one this is good to hear the same one as is used for manual labor but it's also the same word that's used for worshiping God it's used to describe a a form or a degree of physical labor but it's also used in places to describe the act of worship because this guarding and keeping this this dressing and keeping of the garden was physical labor but it was in a place of delight the Bible said that when the when the fall happened and the curse came God didn't say to Adam you're going to work for the first time in your life he didn't say you're going to labor for the first time in your life what did he say what's the word you're going to toil the word is used there toil you're going to you're going to labor by the sweat of your brow it means to toil it it means to labor Under Pressure it means to work Under Pressure it means to work under expectation it means to work under a load before the fall Adam's labor was an act of worship he was guarding the garden he was keeping the garden he was dressing the garden it was costing him some effort but it was considered worship because when you work for God when you labor for God not under pressure but for pleasure when I study that's that's my pleasure if God could have only called me to live somewhere in a cabin with internet so that I could study and just write put thoughts together and send them down the mountain to somebody never have to work under pressure of people's expectations never have to be called on to help fix situations that aren't biblical in the first place that's toil for me it's not really worship it's toil but it's necessary I'm with willing but what I really love is digging in the word I don't do it to be smart or to look like I'm smart that's kind of hard to fake in my condition I'm not trying to look smart but for me it's like worship Lord your word matters you know you can show God the same message by just reading it you don't have to be a scholar you don't even have to be a an extremely obsessive student but we should all be students of the word we should all read somebody said I don't know how to study just get a dictionary that's a good place to start just look up words then of course you're going to discover that what it means in English is not the real meaning anyway so then you're going to have to get a concordance or a lexicon and you're going to have to find out what the original word was that's going to take you to a deeper level we're not all called to teacher preach the word but we're all called to eat it to Feast on it it is the Tree of Life to us it is our source of life and so anything we do like that is is maybe physical effort but it's worship so what Adam was doing in in weeding or whatever little bit of cultivating he was doing it was worship because he was stewarding you that are awake hear me he was being a good Steward of the garden that God had put him in you and I are good stewards of our own garden when we make effort to discover through prayer what's keeping us from getting over the wall what's growing in US preacher preach anyway somebody will hear it later what's what's preventing us if we're fit enough to jump over the hurdles and do all the other exercises of the event why can't we get over that last wall because the enemy knows if we get over that last hump if we ever get the victory over the mind will and motion if we ever win that greatest battle ever fought and may I just tell you spiritually it's already won you just need to raise up and appropriate the victory how do I do that by starting every day making a better choice a better decision a better choice a better decision a better choice a better decision you're redeemed your behavior doesn't lose you your behavior doesn't take you out of God's economy so just start making better choices and quit returning to the vomit quit returning to the pig pin now make a better choice today and this afternoon and tonight and in the night and in the morning yes sir sir I told you some time ago the enemy the battle gets hotter in the night go to bed go to bed you want something to help you go to bed your body was designed to sleep at [Music] night when the day comes get out of bed if you're physically able to do so get up now when it gets dark start winding down you get home from an event you're out a little late you get home at 10:00 you don't have to spend an hour and a half catching up on Facebook what you missed while you were at dinner catch you five minutes build you on a computer a little friends list those people that you really want to know what's going on in their lives and ignore the rest you don't have to know what they had for dinner you don't have to know where they vacationed there are some folks you care about find you a way of separating those folks out and take you 5 10 minutes to keep up with them and then brush your teeth wash your dirty face case go to bed don't lay there for hours on your phone following one search after another one Trail after another if you get a notification in your messenger that somebody that's not on your friend's list wants to talk to you it may not be a good idea to even care I had a surprise one last night and I looked at it I don't always because a lot of times I've got a it'll say you've got you've got 30 from unknown it's whatever the con whatever it says and a lot of times it's group chats that people think that we have so much time in life we lazy sorry preachers that don't ever do anything for a living you know we've got time to read everybody's opinion in these group group things that they put together on uh uh uh um what's the other one what'sapp because the rest of the world uses what'sapp so much if I'm in contact with brother fiser and others it's through WhatsApp and I don't like it I wish I didn't have to have it I don't need something else to keep up with but last night I had a little message someone and and you can just look at the list and and if you don't and if you don't recognize you just delete because sometimes it's a you know a beautiful Filipino looking Asian looking woman who wants to connect well I have never searched that out God is my witness I never have done anything on there that would make that woman know who I am it's not that way that's not the way it works my mother is dead and she gets emails from uh from women wanting to know if she wants to see their chest well I know my mother never emailed a woman wanting to see her chest you get real caught up in that digital world and you'll be invited every now and again one will come in my spam filter and it says something like this we saw you looking at pornography we uh we have uh reversed your camera and we have pictures of you and what you were watching and if you'll send you know whatever it is 300,000 Bitcoin to this account will delete the files and if not I mean I've gotten 10 or 12 through the years and if not we're going to release it well now I just delete them but the first few I got some years ago I was a little more arrogant and I said I want you to and if you want me to I'll send you the emails of my closest friends if you don't already have them so that you can inform them of what kind of per because there's a lot of things you might be able to find out you may be able to find out my birthday you may be able to find out my social security number these days but there's one thing you'll never be able to hold over me is that never heard another word you get in trouble if you chase down but last night there was someone from someone who's not friends that come up on messenger and it was a sister and she said are you the brother Steve Shelly that preached a message in an Arbor Michigan called sh devil about 30 years ago cuz she said if you are I'd like to know it because I remember that message message I was blessed by that message and I would like to tell you that well I had a feeling that one was safe so I answered her and I looked up the date and that was I think it was November of 90 whatever it was uh uh 92 I can't remember now exactly but I looked it up and I said that was me and I was 24 years old and now I'm 56 with four children and and one is married and a and a six-month-old granddaughter pastoring a church uh still working for the Lord and that was the end of that but most of the time if you're involved in that kind of world the enemy will try to use those things to put hooks go to bed you may have to make a decision I don't care if you want to talk to me look folks please understand if it's life or death you can be you can be located sometimes it's just a trap don't fall in it come on make a better decision for yourself don't click on a link if you don't know what it is if somebody send you something and you don't know what it is delete it if it was from them they'll ask you about it if they don't it don't matter anyhow whatever you do Above All Else guard your heart you must I told you charity I probably wouldn't get to page 27 this page two the word used here is let me let me put that back up the word used for in Hebrew for work is the same one as is used for manual labor and I'm I'm almost finished for today and it's also used for worshiping God the picture we get is of the man of the man's work is that it was not backbreaking labor by which he hoped to e out a living that does happen later in the chapter or in the text but at this point his work consists of tending the garden and delighting in God's creation which perhaps better fits a description of and just one more thing on that before we move on and that's Genesis 2:16 And1 17 and the Lord God commanded the man saying the very next verse of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof Thou shalt surely die put that back up just one second sis look at verse 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of Tove and raah good and evil those are important words to keep in mind when going through the Hebrew scripture good and evil Tove and raw remember when you are bringing forth Harvest maturity from the seed that have been planted in You by God he calls that good Tove he might even call it very good to may but when you are not bringing forth the purpose of your birth your Destiny your why the reason you were born God doesn't call that bad it's not good and bad he uses the same Hebrew words here Tove and raw good and evil it's it's good it's delightsome to be bringing to maturity and manifestation what God has planted in you but not to do that is not bad are you watching me I have on a new tie you need to look at it it's very sharp it's not good and bad it's Tove and raw are evil it's evil can I tell you that it's evil according to God's word it's evil if you're living below the purpose that you were here to live if you get the wife and you get the life and you even get the white picket fence and you're living below what God birthed you into this world brought you into this world to be to manifest to display to represent you may have gotten all the other things you may have 30,000 followers but you're taking them to the ditch you may have the admiration of your whole family or your whole church family but if if you're not bringing forth a portion of your destiny purpose God doesn't say that's bad help me he says it's evil that's why we that's why we preach we need the Zeal of building the Lord's House to consume us to devour us to eat us up until we stay constantly on guard guarding and keeping Above All Else yes sir guarding my heart my mind my will my emotions I dare say that most of us spend our lives following our emotions we make choices following our emotions we make decisions following our emotions hello our reactions follow how we feel I'm preaching to you you may be too tired to hear me but I'm preaching we Fellowship based on our prejudices Andor our jealousies Andor the things that are running a Muk we follow our emotions we're led by our feelings so many many many times she makes my heart go pitter patter he makes my heart it may be a it it it may be aib you may be out of static Rhythm I know she's the one because of how I feel how it makes me feel brother sister let me suggest that you take three tongs first before you make a decision based on a your heart doing a flip some people that happens to them they need to go right to the emergency room because it means something's really wrong we we we we take jobs we we we make friends we choose relationships based on how we feel what our emotions are we come to church if we feel like coming now we're having a particularly hard time folks I can say it but you won't believe it we are all in a battle I I'm being transparent when I tell you that there's seven days in a week and I had four four good days and three pretty crummy days but I'm here this morning not because I feel to be feel to be I I mean I do I I can't say that I did want to be here but I'm not always here because I feel like coming what if what if Sunday was one of my crummy days I I have to I have to come I cannot follow my feelings I cannot follow my emotions and to a certain extent you can't either because our emotions are not the enemy our emotions are something that God gave us to help us after we have made a good choice after we've made a decision by the leadership of the word and the spirit then we get the emotion to go with it but too many of us spiral into an emotional whirlpool and we make decisions based on the spiral instead of on the word come on now somebody say above all else I've got to guard my heart I can't live by my emotions I've got to live by the word see it I if I don't bring forth what God created me to bring forth he caused that evil I'm going to put this tree I wanted to talk about the two trees but I'll I'll put that away for another time I want to do one more little thing and and close in Proverbs 4:23 there let's go back to that verse just one more time charity would you just try to remind me that I I left out that section on the trees the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil remember up to that point the only knowledge that Adam and Eve had was the knowledge of of that which was God of that which was good and they were better off we're better off without the knowledge of evil because once you begin to know what the opposite is the enemy tantalizes you he tries to lead us and lure us into the deeper consumption of the knowledge of that which is evil instead of that which is of god and good if you will eat of God and refuse to eat of the knowledge of evil if you'll refuse not to build your life on the smut and the stench of the world around you you you will continue to draw Your Life Source from Jesus who is the Tree of Life in in Proverbs 4:23 again it says keep thy heart with all diligence with all diligence is noted in the margin to be translated As Above All keeping above all keeping keep your heart it's a verb that means means to guard to keep to watch to observe to preserve it's very much like the word that was used when Adam was told to keep the garden stay with me to keep something in the in this sense means more than simply to maintain ownership listen it refers to maintenance care and support to keep your heart to guard your heart doesn't just mean Own It it means keep it healthy yes keep it protected keep it maintained sometimes when people are talking about guarding their heart they mean you've been hurt don't put yourself out there again that's dumb advice you can't live in a cave will the person in this room that's never been hurt never had your feelings hurt will you stand up you can't even hold up Eliana because she's not quite six months old and and and and if you were to tell her no real Stern or take something away from her and say no you'd H her feelings her daddy came in the room last night in the living room and handed her to me and and she smiled at me real big and then turned and watched him walk out of the room and she was not happy she wanted her daddy he hurt her feelings not on purpose but he hurt her feeling there's nobody in this room that hasn't had their feelings hurt you can't go live in a cave guarding your heart doesn't mean not putting yourself in life it doesn't mean hiding from folk it doesn't mean living in a cave it doesn't mean never coming to fellowships it doesn't mean never eating with the Saints that's not guarding your heart that's pulling yourself away from one of your life sources because we not only get life and strength and health from the from the root we get it by being intertwined with other branches iron sharpeneth iron and brothers support Brothers and sisters can lift up sisters nobody ever comes looking for me that's cuz they're so used to you leaving before they get a chance you can even have a piece of pie with us and you call that guarding your heart no no no no in fact no is an important an word when you need to guard your heart that way you don't have to say yes to everything you don't have to agree to everything you don't have to agree to manipulation don't guilt me I'm a busy man don't guilt me into something that's manipulation it's a form of Witchcraft it's evil it's the devil it's demonic if a husband has to guilt his wife that's demonic if a wife has to guilt her husband to manipulate him that's demonic something's wrong don't do that no is okay sometime [Music] no you mean to tell me you won't re no well I just need you to tell me why no if you feel bad saying no like some of you must say it this way I love you but [Music] no next time but [Music] no you know what one of the first words a baby says it's not mama or da da that's the only one we tell people some times the first word is no cuz that's the word they hear the most sometimes we need to say it sometimes we need to even say it to ourselves I'm past my limit my tank is empty my strength is gone my energy is drained no because above all else I know you're too I I know I know diligently guard your heart in order to speak to the person that I had this little thing about and and I believe it was for every one of us I do but I believe it was specific to this individual as well I looked up this this word this uh verse in in a couple of other and I want to give them to you and and then and then unfortunately I have to close in the Amplified it says keep and guard your heart Proverbs 4:23 with all vigilance and above all that you guard Vigilant that means to be awake uhoh I better have some water CU there's only a handful of vigilant people here this morning alert well I hear you brother Billy can can I make fun of you I got a sweet nice text from Sister Laurel I asked to be notified when brother Billy came through surgery and she'd let me know the doctors reached out and he's going to be fine and it was it wasn't even I mean it was just a very short time the phone rang I saw it brother Billy and I took it and I said hello he's hello brother shall he was awake but he wasn't alert he was aware enough to remind me of of something that we had talked about but after that I Saidi going to let you go I think you need some around oh okay kind of reminded me of Otis if you don't know who Otis is you can be sitting in a service awake and not [Music] alert vigilance is defined as the action or state of keeping careful watch for possible danger or difficulty that's exactly what God calls us to do with our hearts be vigilant be alert because your adversary a and then let me give them give them this verse it's musicians start to come Proverbs 423 in the complete Jewish Bible because this is the one that settled it for me above everything else guard your heart would you all read that for me for let's do it one more time for it is the SCE of consquences can can we do it one more time for it is the source of consquences who can who who uh ellias say that out loud for me again would you for it is for out of it are the issues of life for out of the heart out of the abundance of the heart the mouth talks whatever's on your mind it's not so hard listen to me it's not so hard to know how much time someone's spending in the word all you have to do is listen to them talk doesn't make them bad it makes them actually worse than bad it makes them e evil because if all we're talking about is what the world is talking about it means we couldn't possibly be bringing forth the seed so it's more than just bad bad company it's almost evil now it does please I know there's a couple of folks that have a tendency to move toward the religious side so for you let me be careful to say that God doesn't care he is not not offended that you sometimes play Dutch Blitz you are not evil you are not evil because you go and and play a around of of disc golf I like to call it frisbee that's not of itself evil if you're constantly leaving your wife and children to do it without spending ample time with them you're moving toward evil because if you were able to produce a son or daughter or at least do your part as a man then you have as part of the siege of your destiny the responsibility of leading them to Christ not once all the time every day so everybody needs that break and that male bonding time but if that becomes all you talk about college football is it's a religion in the South I don't think God is offended if you happen to know who's winning or I I don't think God is offended if you happen to wear a orange tie or long as it's not for Tennessee but if that's all you talk about you see out of the abundance of the heart the mind the will the emotions the mouth speaks so whatever your heart is filled with and that's why you walk up to somebody and you spew about what's on your mind and sometimes you walk away without ever asking them how they feel or how they're doing or is there anything you can pray with them about because your mind your heart is filled with your problem and that's all you can see at the moment and that's all you want to talk about if you have daddy issues or uh you know past divorce or if that permeates your conversation there's too much of that in your garden if you're hearing someone's hurt and that immediately starts you you know your computer calculating your hurts and before you can even really pay attention to their problem their pain or speak any Word of Life to them you're already comparing your pain with their pain then your garden is crowded and above all else with vigilance and diligence guard your heart for it is the source of life's consequences decisions that we make in our heart with in our mind in a garden that's overgrown and crowded are going to be influenced by the by the stuff so we're going to make decisions based on what's growing in the garden we're going to speak based on what's growing in the garden well the potatoes were overcooked the meat was tough the row was stale the but butter was plastic well how was the napkin oh it was fine how was the water was the water okay well the glass was a little dirty some of our Gardens are just full of so many wrongs that have been done to us and so many complaints through the years and so much negative that we see negative First and positive last in every situation Lord will you walk through the garden of my heart again Daniel skipworth did some gardening work for me you know he worked at a lawn in garden and all of a sudden if you know Daniel you know his personality and all of a sudden he was a horticulturist I liked it it was very beneficial and uh the palm trees in my yard that started out about that tall and now they're very high Daniel and I planted those and they were hard to plant and he said brother Shelly while you're doing such and such he said I'm going to run up front and I'm going to I'm going to pull some weeds out of the front bed oh you of by all means go do it and he went and did he come out and he said I'm done now we can finish thus thus and thus a few days later I I happened to be walking across the front of the yard and I looked in the garden bed and I said no sister Doris's flowers she gave me these flowers sister Flo and I planted and Daniel has weeded them all thank the lord it's happened more than once my wife cleaned me out one year but they're they're not fancy flowers They're amazing flowers that pop up everywhere and you have to pull a Chad you probably did it too there amazing you think you've got them on you'll never get one back but the next year they're somewhere else in the yard just go dig them up and bring them cuz they're everywhere but I didn't know that in the beginning you see you need the Lord's help to show you what is a weed and what's a seed of your destiny cuz if it's supposed to be there you want it to be there may not be pretty right now it may just be a a scrawny stem but if God God wants it there one of these days he's going to look at it and it's going to be beautiful he's going to bless it and it's going to Blossom because that's a part of what he's planted in you if you just do it by your own Vision if you do it by your own feeling if you do it by your own thought you're liable to uproot something that God has put there and folks I'm closing but it might even be a thorn in in your flesh who wouldn't want to pull up a thorny Bush who wouldn't want to yank something out if you poked yourself a time or two we have haven't we in gardening who wouldn't want to get rid of that so you never had to feel that pain again but what you may not realize is God placed that that thorn there to find your flesh the preacher's preaching I was I'm talking about him you know he may have placed that there so that you would be able to quickly readily find your flesh and identify the desire of the flesh but it's there and it may not be beautiful to you I remember time that I used to think that succulents were some of the ugliest plants that i' have ever seen and now I like them a lot I think they're beautiful plants I just needed to understand a little bit more about them sometimes that thing that God has placed allowed to be placed in your heart sewn into your heart even that you don't understand because it doesn't look like the other things in your life that are flourishing if God put it there you want to leave it there the only way to know the difference is to keep inviting him to have fellowship with you in the garden of your heart come back lord walk with me again through the Garden Of My Heart Lord show me the prickly things that need to go and show me the prickly things that need to stay show me the things that I chopped off but the root remained a a visiting preacher came through and gave me a word or preached an inspiring sermon and I I went to my garden with with whackers and I whacked it all down but nobody seemed to tell me I didn't know that I was supposed to dig at the very root of it until it hurt because I didn't it keeps sprouting up I need you Lord to walk with me you show me you point out to me the things that need to die by the root father give me Grace to separate those ugly things from their life Source Above All Else Lord give me wisdom and discernment to guard and keep my heart this is a wicked hour this is a wicked day but the bride of Christ is moving toward the headstone we're coming up into the stature of a perfect man and you have said to this body today above all else we must be Watchmen on the wall not only to help protect each other but even ourselves Lord take me high enough sometime to see my own heart may I stop making decisions based on emotion and seek your word Lord may I quit making excuses God didn't tell me what to do when your word is full your word is full of what to do and I keep turning a blind eye to the symbolism and the richness of scripture I dismiss it because I don't want it to have anything to do with my life and yet you keep bringing me back to that scripture to remind me there is my answer there is my answer and I keep stepping on my answer like brother Bobby says don't play the dumb act sometime we play the dumb act we do know what God wants from us we do know what you want Lord but sometimes we pre pretend to be ignorant because we know the cost is too great Lord help us to be willing cut out the bitterness of of the past and and live in the now Above All Else above all else may we be vigilant may we be determined to guard our heart to control our emotions to deal with our thoughts if the heart is is our mind spiritually then it doesn't start with our words it starts with our thoughts may I have the mind of Christ may I pray until I have the mind of Christ Lord let the Zeal of building you a house consume me until there is nothing left but an eternal yes may I stop doctoring history and rewriting my past and just dig it up by the root and be rid of it I've tried tending to my garden alone and I keep making mistakes walk through my heart with me Lord I don't want to keep something based on fondness that needs to go if you really didn't want any of sister dar's flowers in my garden I don't either I don't want anything hanging around taking up space affecting my fruitfulness I've got to have a garden that you want to spend time with me in above all else I Repent oh God for letting down my own guard and I ask for your strength to be vigilant on the wall watching after my own thought life we're depending on you Jesus let's stand together we're depending on you Jesus I want to be used in the service of the Lord how many of you really don't just jump on the bandwagon because somebody on your road did how many of you really desire to be used in the service of the Lord hold up your hand to him salvation to you is free but in order to be used in the service of the lord it's going to cost you everything everything everything everything everything everything everything familiar the ly wolf song that we sing sometime we're not going to sing it just now but we sing it sometime take my houses and lands change my dreams and my plans I'm placing my whole life in your hands and whatever it takes for my will to break that's what I'll be willing to do take the dearest things to me if that's how it must be to Draw Me Closer to You hard words hard reality I mentioned recently it cost brother brandham his first wife and his baby girl he let the influence of his mother-in-law separate him from the call to go and it cost him he thought losing his chair was the only penalty but he lost more than his favorite chair and one day after she's gone he's visiting her grave in the cemetery and just like that she steps out from behind a tree some people in the modern Church would call that necromancy I call it the grace of God who thinned the veil and let brother brandham catch a glimpse and she spoke to him comforted his heart we're we're we're okay you better do what you're called to do God cared so much the price was great but God's Great Grace and comfort wanted to take him to the next level I've got to go I have to go to the next level let's let's come around the altar this morning and stand for just a moment and we're we I'm I'm I've slowed down to nearly a crawl and I'm going to get out of the way but but before I do I I want us to sing this little song before Benjamin comes and Lead leads us in worship I want us to sing the old song Jesus used me I I want to be usable and I I can't be usable if my heart is overcrowded by the past if it's overcrowded by unforgiveness or bitterness or resentment it chokes out the good seed again and again and again I need to do some some some pulling up and digging out and and then I need to be a better guard I need to be a better Watchman I need to not only guard my heart but then I have to see about my eyes and my lips and my feet Proverbs that verse goes on to tell us if you're willing if you're willing to be used if you think it's going to be all easy we you should know better by now well I have been used in the past would you like to be

Redeemer oh you are youel oh the rescue for siners and the ransom from heaven oh Jesus Messiah you are the Lord of all the Lord of all now sometimes getting a glimpse of your garden can be a little overwhelming that's why mine looks like it does in the natural because if you let it go too long it has a life of its own that can be discouraging and overwhelming especially in a time when you're already dealing with strong emotions but here's what you have to remember you are not just a church member somewhere you're a Son of God I am a Son of God let me hear you say it I am a Son of God that's all of us isn't it not just men but I am a Son of God and because of that the blood does more than just save you or become some reconc ilation for you it redeems you and it takes you all the way back to the original thoughts of God concerning your life and even when you have let your inner man become a jungle your relationship as a son does not change it greatly affects your fellowship because he no longer has freedom to come and walk with you in the cool of the evening in the garden of your heart you have to invite him to come to point out the mess the stuff that has to go and maybe even before you can do that you've got to you've got to remove some stuff you know about cuz there may be some things we know that's growing that we need to get rid of don't even need the Lord to point it out we could make some room for him to come he does that because he loves you and you caring about your heart remember that's not toil that's not heavy labor or fleshly striving the Bible calls it Worship You caring about guarding and keeping your heart becomes an effort of cultivation that is not toil or sweaty labor but it's worship to the Lord the fact that you would come before him today and ask for his help to to clean out your heart to get rid of some of the thoughts that need to go and then invite him to have fellowship with you there to him that's worship he sees your desire to worship as more important than the particular details of what needs to be dealt with so don't stand here guilty and feeling condemned because you've let some things go that you should have dug out a long time ago make up your your mind today that you're going to move forward in a worshipful attitude to start cultivating and taking care of some of the things that you've let grow there too long and then eventually you're going to have room for him to come and have great fellowship with you there you're going to need the Lord we're going to need the Lord in the days ahead we're going to need not only relationship but we're going to need Fellowship like we've never needed it before when you feel like there's nobody else let me tell you something he desires to be for you more than enough can anybody testify that in that moment he is more than enough his grace remember that thorny Bush that you wanted to get rid of and God wouldn't move it and he wouldn't help you move it remember what he said my my grace my grace is sufficient you leave it right there that's to make sure that you don't become exalted in your bride Pride that's for you to know that your flesh is still alive and it has to be dealt with every day that thorn in the flesh that the Apostle had everybody's got something like that but remember his grace Lord your grace is sufficient so we stand here today not condemned hopefully convicted and now we offer to you our sincerest worship come Lord and give us Grace to get her done may we not put it off another hour may we not put it off another minute one of the things that I didn't get to was a quote where brother brandham said if you have one ought in your heart against anybody you're in danger of Hellfire now that's a pretty strong warning if you stand here today and there's odd in your heart that lays there toward somebody today you tell the Lord I need your help but I am serving an eviction notice on that ought on that thought that is not right that is not wholesome that is not healthy that is not true I don't want that odd in my heart I want it out and I'm asking you Lord to come even now with your grace give me strength to drive it out of the garden give me strength to separate it from my heart would you just maybe put your hand on somebody next to you right now and and uh uh maybe your their shoulder and and just agree with them you don't have to pray some fancy prayer but let's just agree right now that we're going to make worship this worship of important part cultivating and keeping and guarding watching for thoughts that need to be cast down watching for words that come out of the abundance of our heart that we really don't want to speak because they're death and darkness and Shadow instead of love and light father help us put a watch over our heart and to stay on our lips but that's not totally your responsibility because you told us that we should exercise Temperance as one of the fruits of the spirit and that we should be able to show and exercise self-control over our own emotions our thoughts and our words Lord would you let us begin to bring forth the fruit of of temperance in our lives longsuffering and meekness and Lord may we be able today to see that this is not an undoable task this is a task that we just have gotten slack in raise us up and remind us that we don't have to do this alone it's your desire to help us with the inner troubles father right now strengthen my brother strengthen my sister in the name of Jesus remind them right now who they are remind them lord of the Revelation that has set them apart Hallelujah remind them of their identification in Christ remind us that we were in you when you suffered in you when your flesh died in you when you resurrected to life and because of those promises you see the bride of Christ that's another people that just serve him when things are going well that little bride serves him and loves him in every circumstance of life because she's a part of him she came from him to neglect him would be to even neglect who she is awaken us awaken us to a fresh reality of who you are in our lives break the hold of the enemy on our thoughts in the name of Jesus we call death upon every thought that seeks to separate us from our Liberty in Christ we call death to it the end to it in the name of Jesus we take the axe to the root of that thought that tries to exalt itself and take preeminence in our heart only Jesus there's only room for Jesus on the throne of preeminence come and sit Lord on the throne of preeminence in our life and Rule and Reign strengthen us to control our thoughts our words our behaviors our Deeds Jesus thank you thank you for your help thank you for your wonderful Grace thank you for the strength to press through the battle may we not get our eyes on anybody else may we put our eyes on you right now we pray for others and we offer a helping hand but Lord may we not look to them may we look to you

not a hugger but there's a lot that can happen in a hug even in a warm handshake not when it's like a dead fish in your hand but a warm handshake you can say a lot with your eyes you don't always have to talk with your mouth we need to be there for one another in whatever way we can and we live busy lives and so we can't always stay on the telephone I just about despise it but when we are together
