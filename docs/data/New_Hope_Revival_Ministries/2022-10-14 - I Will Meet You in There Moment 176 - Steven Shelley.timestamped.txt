[0:00] God said I will meet you in there
[0:05] I will meet you in you in there friends
[0:08] there's something
[0:10] Supernatural
[0:12] something incredibly Supernatural I have
[0:17] been I have been pondering the lights of
[0:20] God for quite some time because we talk
[0:24] about don't let the light go out and I
[0:28] Ponder I Ponder how is it that this
[0:31] seven Branch Candlestick can never go
[0:35] out because the Wicks have to be trimmed
[0:37] and oil has to be added and I'm telling
[0:40] you it's not the right light
[0:44] it's the Shekinah in the holy of holies
[0:49] the light of God that never goes out
[0:52] that's the light that we're looking for
[0:57] we're looking for light to be so evident
[1:00] inside of us that it never goes out we
[1:05] have our ups we have our downs we have
[1:08] our sunny days and we have our cloudy
[1:10] days and we have to keep the Wicks
[1:13] trimmed and be refilled with oil but oh
[1:17] if we could ever get inside of the holy
[1:20] of holies and be so endued with power
[1:24] from on high the Shekinah the light of
[1:28] God that will forever change us
[1:33] but people have been too afraid
[1:36] too afraid
[1:38] too afraid
[1:40] you know why we've been too afraid
[1:42] because we've been sold a bill of goods
[1:45] by the enemy that tried to continue to
[1:48] tell us that we were not worthy to come
[1:50] in that we had too many sins in our life
[1:53] that we had too many scars in our life
[1:56] that we had too much hanging on us that
[1:58] we could not go behind there but my
[2:00] friend we have an open invitation and
[2:04] you don't have to get good enough our
[2:06] lamb was the best he was the perfect
[2:09] lamb and he invited us in behind there
[2:13] but I want to tell you something today
[2:17] when you find yourself in that little
[2:21] room
[2:23] he made a promise to you
[2:26] I will meet you there
[2:29] if you have met the requirements that he
[2:33] gave in his word if you repent and
[2:36] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[2:40] the remission of your sins you shall
[2:42] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[2:46] there is something behind that Veil that
[2:49] Veil that was ripped from top to bottom
[2:51] that's not the veil that I'm talking
[2:53] about there is a veil that the enemy has
[2:57] tried to put in front of us to keep us
[2:59] out but the word the revelation of the
[3:03] of Jesus Christ has come and unveiled to
[3:07] the people of God
[3:13] okay
[3:13] [Music]
[3:14] now this unveiling
[3:16] was not to the crowd at Large
[3:23] [Music]
[3:24] when this unveiling
[3:27] takes place
[3:28] it's an unveiling to an individual
