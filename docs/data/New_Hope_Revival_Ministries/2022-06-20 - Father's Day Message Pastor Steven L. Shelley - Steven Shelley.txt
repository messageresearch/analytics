hallelujah you may have your seat this morning hallelujah he is good he is good hallelujah we're gonna go to the lord in prayer today i know there are many out sick needing a touch from the lord do you have a need by the uplifting of your hand today yeah i know there are many let's remember sister joyce who is recovering quite well at home and brother greeley because he's been in close quarters he sent a note this morning to say that he just he just couldn't come and not greet people so he was going to stay at home for our safety this morning but they're streaming the service we heard that rachel had been exposed and had been working this week with symptoms and so she is not here this morning uh we know that levi tested negative but sister jennifer had a fever in the night last night so out of kindness toward all of us they have stayed at home today and we want to hold every one of them up ian has had a very very sore throat unable to swallow food and we want to lift him up to the lord in prayer we have two situations we have uh a real cold going around which is very common this time of year when we have extreme heat and then air conditioning and then you out you're out in the extreme heat and you're back in the air conditioning uh i suggest you don't give up the air conditioning but anyway so there are those who are suffering with a real cold and but because it runs some time with the fever and with similar symptoms to covid they there are people concerned about us because we're traveling next week a lot of us are going to be going to texas we don't want to take anything and i'm just a little selfish i really don't want to miss my son's wedding you know they could get another preacher but he can't get another dad so i want to be there and so i appreciate everyone who has taken precaution the main symptoms that sister joyce has complained about and when i say complain she's has not complained but what she has experienced has been an extreme headache and a sore throat and then the congestion the coughing and so forth and etc so there is a lot of that going around if you are here today and you are sick we love you and we thank you for coming we would be happy to lay hands on you and pray for you we are not afraid to do that but if you feel that you have a fever it would just be a great kind gesture for you to slip out i'll meet you in the vestibule and pray for you we're not afraid to pray for you but we really don't want anybody to to spread what's going on uh sister elfrida is not here this morning and uh we want to hold her up to the lord in prayer anna christina is not feeling well today just because someone is sick doesn't mean that they have coveted this is a very mild strain the problem is if you are vulnerable if you have already some pre-existing conditions it can still be serious and there are churches as large as happy valley who are not having in-person services today so there is an upsurge in new uh covid and they are quite amazed at how many of these people are double and triple vaccinated and it just proves that every time a virus changes it often outgrows any vaccination and so we have we do want to pray pray for our safety this week that god will help every one of us to be protected and i not only am not interested in having it i don't want to pass it to anyone who may not be able to weather the storm as as we have in the past uh brother greeley senior our precious brother is going for surgery tomorrow brother greeley uh our brother greeley has explained to us on tuesday night how that this will be handled the knee will be taken out there will be a spacer knee put in that is uh treated with antibiotic to try to cut down and kill the infection in that knee and all of that has to be cleared up and taken care of before a new knee replacement goes in well our precious brother is in his 80s and uh he's tired and his body has been fighting this infection for over a year he needs a miracle we don't know exactly what time the surgery will be tomorrow but we are praying that god will undertake for the for him his family our precious sister greeley that god will be with her and strengthen her and uh our brother greeley was going to go and be there for this time but was unable to do so so hold him up and sister megan keno reached out this morning to pray for a a family of a friend of hers in tucson who was lost who passed away asking that god would speak to the family that he would draw that family to him there are those who will be traveling before next sunday so we want to pray for them that god will give them safety as they travel some will be making stops on their way to texas and going other places and some will be visiting other places after the wedding we just want safety over this body always but especially in the next couple of weeks that god would just help every one of us that's all that i have for spoken requests but there are always unspoken requests remember paul and martha to the lord they're going through a difficult time in their life and we would like for the lord to comfort them and be with them during this just time mention of your name the flowers grow and the desert glooms again just like fire in winter's cold like your precious gold jesus just the mention of your name sing it out with me [Music] oh jesus just the mention of your name [Music] the flowers grow and the desert glooms again [Music] is gold jesus just the mention [Music] of your name brother daniel would you come pray this morning sing it again oh jesus just the mention of your name hallelujah thank you lord the flowers grow and the desert blooms again [Music] oh just [Music] lord jesus it's just the mention of your warning can you help me take these requests to the lord this morning heavenly father we bow before you as a body for as a body this morning we have more authority you said wherever two or three gathered in your name you'd be in the midst it only takes two or three of us lord but there's several of us here today and there's several out and our hearts and our minds go to them lord that are being conscious of the warfare that's being wrought in this day how the enemy has tried to displace churches how the enemy has tried to displace bodies by sending in this sneaky attack but god we know that you are more than able and we thank you for being our healer [Music] we thank you for the stripes you born we thank you for the promise lord we thank you for the finished work today it's over because of you you're the greatest father that the world could ever know oh god today if you would just take the time to visit our loved ones and our friends if you if you would take the time today lord to grant revelation to us that we can hold on to these things that you've done that we wouldn't be distracted by the wiles of the enemy or his torment lord but we would look to calvary and we would know it is finished we believe today we thank you lord we thank you for brother greeley senior's healing today we thank you for the work that you're doing in his life and we're believing for a total recovery lord we know that you you care so much we thank you for your presence in this room today for every spoken request for traveling mercies for the upcoming wedding for the body lord pray that your angels may you dispatch extra for the trip lord oh how satan hates a body of believers that cares about others lord we're a family we don't want anything to hurt our family so we ask you to go go with every car that leaves this week for every car that leaves next week for their safe return lord for the stops along the way may the angels be welcome and greeted may there be no resistance to our commute lord oh we believe today lord we believe it's already done we believe that you're granting our petitions this morning we're so thankful we look forward to the remainder of this service now and great expectation of you speaking to us giving us strength for the journey as we pray in the precious name of the lord jesus christ our messiah amen amen hallelujah praise the lord hallelujah you may be seated sister kathy

told you my story [Music] that never gave up [Music] and if i told you my story you would hear life [Music] but it wasn't mine [Music] if i should speak then let it be of the grace that is greater than all my sin of when justice was served and when mercy wins of the kindness of jesus that draws me in [Music] my order is to tell of him [Music] if i told you my story you would hear victory [Music] over the enemy and if i told you my story you would hear freedom that was one for me and if i told you my story you would hear life overcome the grave if i should speak then let it be of the grace that [Music] was is and where mercy wins of the kindness of jesus that draws me in order you my story is to tell of him this is my story this is my song praising my savior all the day long this

to tell of him [Music] [Applause] hallelujah how many of you have a story how many of your stories similar to sister kathy's if that's what the story is if that's what her story is then i would say almost every one of us have a similar story one that tells of grace that is greater than sin until you get to know someone and hear their story you don't know where they've been you don't know where the lord has brought them from there are amazing testimonies sitting here this morning amazing unbelievable testimonies of how grace has won how jesus has conquered all bondage how he's still the great emancipator and the great deliverer and his brother daniel prayed this morning the greatest papa the greatest father that anyone could ever dream of having and he never fails he is faithful we want to say happy father's day to not only all the fathers that are here this morning but also to the fathers that are streaming this service god bless you everyone so many times you are underappreciated and maligned in society most everyone is kind when they speak of mothers but if you would just think back over the past 40 years 50 years or more in public entertainment even you would think of dozens of examples where father is the stupid one he is he is the dummy and he's the one that's being led around by a bossy wife but i'm here to tell you that there are men of god in the world that are not dumb they may be a little underappreciated sometime they may check out a little more than we'd like for them to sometime but we are thankful that there are men of god who are serving their families with honor and with integrity can you say amen to that again god bless every one of you we are blessed we are blessed here to have some of those fathers and we have some amazing young fathers who are doing an incredible job raising their children and uh it brings me a special pleasure to watch these young dads with their children it really means something to me and it's not easy it's certainly not easy on mother but it's not always easy on father because he is out of the home and he comes home tired and sometimes the last thing that he wants is to play but tea party it is or wrestling it is i pray that that's the way it is at your house it is vitally vitally important my mother was both a mother and a father to me she was the best father that she could be but she wasn't the best father because she wasn't a father and so if you uh are a dad be there be available no matter the cost and always know that sleep will come it comes eventually it does come and things do slow down never i mean things do slow down we we uh lost the oldest father uh among us when we lost brother west and i miss him so terribly much all the time not just some of the time but all of the time but oh my as i thought of the song that was sung last week i think about wonderful days ahead of strolling over heaven with brother west brother richard was our oldest father but he is out of town and not here hasn't been with us for a bit and so we are looking for our oldest father and we want to give you a little gift from the church to let you know how much we love you and appreciate you i remember the years that brother tremaine would get it and brother pisces would get it uh brother reed i i brother shaw you're a little younger than brother reed aren't you he may not i'm glad you all are friends you may not hear brother shaw amen again but he got that amen in that's particularly funny to us because we had benjamin's get-together uh i don't know we don't call it a bachelor party but but his uh get-together this week and and brother shaw sat close to us and i mean we all we really did rhonda you'd have been so happy we really got him just got him and got him and he took it so well he just we just ragged him real good about being the senior one but uh brother uh shaw how old are you 60th baron you know that's just young 63 is just young brother reid you're a few years older than that 68. well you're a special kind of father i thought about you this week and uh you know it's it's one thing when you serve your family your biological children but it's it's particularly special when you are willing to take someone's children and love them as your own and be there for them even when they're grown and i happen to know that brother reed has been that kind of dad and we want to honor you would you come here and just get a little something from our church [Applause] we love you god bless you praise the lord happy father's day to you [Applause] and then we're looking for the youngest uh who how old are you luke oh you're an old man zach is 27 are you 27 oh boy you're being challenged you heard that boy that come out quick when's his birthday when is your birthday december well we have to deliver that's the only thing about we always want new people to come to the church but we don't particularly pray they'll be young the youngest dad right we since i don't know math i'm not bringing your zack you're coming to get it you will never be remembered again as the youngest father that's it this is your sunday happy father's day boy i just i don't i don't do good at this my granny used to do this so well i love to watch her do it it delighted her to be able to do it and uh so i do this in her honor every year uh then we go to uh the oh of the the dad who has the most uh children and we sometimes say biological sometimes we say present and uh because we recognize that stepdads can be godsent they absolutely can be god's sent and we want to honor them today without any prejudice because they carry some so uh we'll do it both ways brother robert uh all together you have how many biological children five biological children and then we add that how many more eight more and you're not amish that is a lot brother brother brother shane you have uh eight all together is that correct i think that we have to break this tie again at least for this sunday so brother robert will you come and let us honor you as a real papa a real dad and having a host of children god bless you thank you great great dad great stepdad brother shane we want to honor you come that's perfect just bring her boy she's looking pretty god bless you brothers we love you happy father's day let me just what's going on what's going on what's going on in here what's going on in here i see a smile we have one more since we had so many tiebreakers and this would be for the father who has unless you've already received one who had who has had the baptism of the holy ghost the longest besides me wow am i now that person 86 brother reed 73 that's even before mine that's uh mine was 75 so that's a long time who else how who else uh anybody else want to put their year in how many years is that for you oh yeah yes you do because i just did help him help me help him other than did you need your toes yeah yeah other than brother reading myself has anyone had the baptism of the holy ghost longer than 36 years and brother how many 42 years you already received one anybody else it's yours brother daniel god bless you love you happy father's day i think that's worth honoring too you know to and and we can say most of the time when we honor someone like that who's had the baptism of the holy ghost the longest and we could say that about these men is that they've been in church they didn't just get it and go out and do this and that and backslide and be gone for years and come back to god but these are men that that got the real deal they weren't perfect i'm sure i've certainly not been but they've stood the test of time and they should be honored you agree all right we have a present for every father if you'll come and that includes you that just received a gift card would you come and let us love on you just a minute and hand you a little present from the church now we were running a little slim on on options for this year and that's not a very particularly manly color but the reason why it's made that way is so you'll find it and it's pretty handy look you do it does both have you ever been on a job and needed the other a flathead or or a phillips this is both so i think that's pretty neat amen so your dad's come would you and receive one of these come on let's go move it [Laughter] praise the lord god bless you happy father's day happy father's day happy father's day to all of you we thank god for you ben are you getting ready i bless you god bless you i bless you god bless you god bless you brother happy father's day god

all right it keeps you awake and uh we've taken care of father's day now and very delighted to do that and we have mentioned where some of the folks are who are not with us today and i did fail to mention that sister nakisha and sister audrey uh lewis had reached out for prayer they need prayer in their body so we are lifting them up to the lord and believing that god will help them my father-in-law who's streaming this service today has a birthday it's very hard for us as his family to believe that he turned 79 today on father's day but we want to wish him a very happy birthday and a happy father's day let's say god bless brother whitaker today lord you see our precious brother bless him today and strengthen him tomorrow is bethany's birthday let's say happy birthday to bethany

sister mary beth you all share a wedding anniversary with brother branham and sister hope his first wife who went to be with the lord not too long into their marriage and they were married in 1934 and also uh it is the i believe that is wednesday i might have that wrong that might have been friday but i believe that's right but it is also uh give me just a moment i i i don't want to speak out and be wrong again no that's right and it was on wednesday and it's also on wednesday that we remember the little story that he told about the resurrection of the little fish where god under inspiration spoke and said give him his life he spoke to that little fish i give you your life in the name of the lord jesus christ which speaks to us a lot of this coming hour this next season that we enter into where the power of the spoken creative word is among us and accomplishing all that needs to be accomplished to get the bride out of here we're looking forward to all that god has for us in that can you say amen and i just need to make a little uh quick a poll here and remind you that on uh tuesday june 28th there will not be a service here that's not this tuesday how many of you know what this tuesday means that means this next one that's coming up the day after tomorrow i say that because people still get confused on how many a couple is that's two three and more is several can we all agree on that when you say a couple of something you're talking about two that makes a couple hope there's no three couples around threesomes it's a couple two and when you say more than two it's several and when we say this tuesday we mean the very next one coming and when we say next tuesday we mean not this one but the one after this one oh we've been needing to have this conversation a long time to get us all on the right pay and you just happen to be here the sunday that we get this thing straightened out once and for all so this tuesday we will be having a service next tuesday the tuesday following this tuesday there will be no service and that date happens to be june 28th and there will be no service that following sunday july the 3rd well i've never heard of a church not having served now you have so we will put a sign on the door and we will let people know there'll be no service here there are dozens of ministries around the world that you can stream if you'd like to stream live we can give you our most recommended sources i am not afraid of you committing spiritual adultery with a pastor and listening to other preachers i think sometimes it can be very healthy and so we would we we don't have a problem with that under most circumstances and if you are at home and you're not streaming and you want to hear a brother branham's sermon you go right to the app it's on our phone it's easy to download if you don't have it shame on you and uh you can stream the service live if you look just a moment here there are people here streaming and uh and commenting right here on the on the app and you can also watch videos of previous services and you can hear some um some marvelous sermons here including uh some from brother perry green all of our service and the series are on here so there are there's plenty of spiritual things that we can do to feed on during those two services and i don't mean to say it flippantly i apologize to you that that's the way it is but so many of us are going to be in texas for the wedding and we've never had a situation like this where we had to do it this way before but we're just trusting that god will don't you care about those of us left behind absolutely i care about you that's why we're pointing you in all these different directions to get the help that you need i was lamenting about so many being gone this coming sunday because there's quite a few people leaving early and then it dawned on me that they're making it part of their vacation and uh extending their stay either on on end before or after and some both and really as hard as it will be to miss them next sunday i really am getting a blessing because a lot of folks are getting their vacation out all at one time so we can come back and have have everybody here and uh so i would just like to see the hands of those don't be overwhelmed when you see all these hands but i would just like to see the hands of those who are leaving for texas or thereabouts before next sunday and you will not be with us hold up your hand just a minute all right well that's quite a few all right so you will not be with us and uh we will pray for your safety as you travel and then uh brother greeley his family are leaving on monday by aeroplane and my family part of our family is leaving on monday by airplane by on tuesday by airplane and on wednesday by driving or tuesday evening by driving tuesday morning by driving so we have three different uh groups going in different directions and we would like for you to remember our joshua who will be driving uh with with samuel and isaiah kinser and we want them to have safety on the road how many of you are driving let me see your hand you're driving to texas so this is a lot of folks that need to be remembered to the lord how many of you are flying hold up your hand okay so we want to pray for all those that are going that god will be with them and that god will just give us a wonderful time and we are very very thankful that the lord has done this for benjamin and that's a very special time for our family and we appreciate all your love i would like to ask one one small thing from you and that is sometimes when they have their showers their their bridal showers they mention in that uh bring a gift and bring something for the house some some staple is that what you still say state pantry goods or staple goods things that last that you need when you're starting out a home luke was there recently and he put up amazing shelves in their pantry but it is very empty and they did not do that for jenna shower and uh we know that there have some there are several that have asked can we do that and not only can you we would love it it would be a real blessing benjamin is not only our son but he is the worship leader he does a fabulous job and he gives of himself i remember the criticism that that he has gotten through the years for for uh putting everything in i tell you as a pastor i'll never criticize somebody for putting everything they got in and if that comes across a little showy to you well i don't think you're able to see perhaps the sincerity of his heart and i would so much rather him move about and put everything that he's got into worship than be like an icicle and not only can he lead us and and does he put his worship in but he has an amazing voice too and i'm thankful for that that's an important part of leading worship is to be able to carry a tune without a bucket because you don't always have a bucket and god is good to him and certainly is so if you'd like to do that beginning uh next sunday or you can start tuesday night or next sunday you can bring in canned goods or anything that you would like to pass on to them to help them get started in their pantry life huh lots of vegetables lots of cans butter beans and all the things that he eats have they learned to can have they learned to can chicken fingers yet would you all feed jenna just feed her bring bring what bring what she might would like to eat um but anything like that pastas or whatever you ladies nobody has to tell the ladies what to do they know how to do it but let's just do that it it came in my heart i i said it to my wife i know she felt a little you know you just don't don't want to it's our son and i know that but i said i'm not doing it because he's our son i'm doing it because he's a worship leader because he holds an office in the church and it'd just be a wonderful way to honor them and for those of you that don't know their their uh situation is such that they are staying around and i i just i'm so happy because it's so hard uh to transition there and then say goodbye and then be gone for a week or two weeks or however long people do for honeymoons now but they're doing a tremendous thing because there's so many friends and family members she has a huge family so many friends and family members coming in from out of town that they're actually staying in the area uh for the weekend even though their wedding is on thursday evening they're staying there for the weekend and when we start flying back then they're going to drive back god bless them with a friend in the church there who's who's really bearing the expense of getting the rest of her belongings here as a gift as a wedding gift and that is a real blessing they operate a professional company that does that kind of kind of thing and then they're going to be around with us for a couple of weeks uh before they actually go on honeymoon so those pantry items will be helpful when they come home because he needs to learn right away that dinner at mama's is by appointment because that uh that grocery bill needs to be shifting now this is a great time for us to start thinking about our future how many of you know that's not gonna work we're just gonna draw the line when the laundry basket comes that's where the line is gonna be drawn she's told him no more laundry and that's for somebody who changes clothes three times a day maybe four he wouldn't think of wearing a pair of jeans without washing them amen let's stand in that real spiritual way to start the sermon it is a truth and i wanted to mention that there might have been something else we needed to get in and then we'll all be gathered back here some of us will be here for tuesday night july the 5th a tuesday night service and then the following sunday everybody should be back from holiday and we want to welcome all of you that are streaming the service around the world some are local and some as far away as trinidad and israel and the netherlands and uh tucson and south africa and and ghana and kenya and canada and it goes on and on and god bless every one of you psalms 112 are you ready you got to be ready now because i know we've had a lot of things let's thank god for these musicians i wanted them to hear those announcements and this has been an odd service and taking so much time but we needed to do it psalms 112. i'm going to be reading in the amplified version of the bible and we're going to read 10 verses praise the lord hallelujah blessed happy fortunate to be envied is the man who fears reveres and worships the lord who delights greatly in his commandments does anybody know any men like that i do i do his spiritual offspring shall be mighty upon the earth and king james says his seed and remember that the word seed is both singular and plural the generation of the upright shall be blessed prosperity and welfare are in his house that's not a government a program of assistance there it's wellness and his righteousness endures forever it outlives him because it's not his righteousness it's the lord's imparted righteousness he leaves behind a legacy of righteousness for his seed that's pretty powerful isn't it light arises in the darkness for the upright gracious compassionate and just who are in right standing with god when you read the word upright this is what it means it means standing upright standing right with god it is well with the man who deals generously and lends now we get that and lends from from the hebrew expression that's used here and there are some people who believe that it's not christ-like to lend money to the brethren we should just give it well if you can give it give it but it is not against the word to lend to require interest is when it's unfair you see the difference if you need a little something extra if it's a large amount and you're saying i'd like to loan you this at a a cheaper interest rate than you could get at the bank but i have this money i can't lose it but i want to do this for you and you're doing it uh without usury you're doing it fairly and i want you to know it is absolutely a christ-like thing to do to be good to brothers and sisters amen you can't always just write a check sometimes you have to say in fact there are certain circumstances where it's a wiser decision to say i'm willing to loan you this money than it is to give it there are certain circumstances you're quiet already it is well with a man who deals generously and lends who conducts his affairs with justice he will not be moved forever the uncompromisingly righteous the upright in right standing with god shall be in everlasting remembrance he shall not be afraid of bad news evil tidings his heart is what firmly fixed how many of you know we've shown you in hebrew and greek where the heart and the mind are connected so his heart his mind is firmly fixed he's determined trusting leaning on and being confident in the lord it's powerful his heart is established and steady remember that the heart and the mind is the seat of the emotions so it's very important that our emotions are established and steady we're not all over the place he will not be afraid while he waits to see his desire established upon his adversaries he has distributed freely he has given to the poor and needy his righteousness uprightness and right standing with god endures forever his horn his authority shall be exalted in honor that's powerful word let's get that again his horn which is his authority shall be exalted in honor it's always right to honor the righteous man the godly man the man of integrity he should be honored not worshipped honored he has distributed freely all right go on to the next verse the wicked man will see it and be grieved and angered not only jealous but angered he will gnash his teeth and disappear in despair the desire of the wicked shall perish and come to nothing amen even though he gnashes his teeth against the righteous man the lord will preserve the righteousness of the godly hallelujah and the wicked shall perish and come to nothing you don't have to curse them they curse themselves you don't have to put something on them they're putting something on them themselves when they mistreat you they're already bringing a curse upon their own life come on now you you've been in the restaurant there when you started getting bad treatment for no reason you can see that other people are getting amazing service but from the same person you're getting anger almost you wonder why it's because the presence has shifted because you're there and those spirits will get stirred up because of who you are don't let it disturb your peace leave a big tip and a big smile and go out of there not cursing the restaurant or the server lord open their eyes and let them see that they can also have the blessing in favor of the lord we're way too quick to judge people when we ought to be releasing mercy to them i want you to say amen father we love you today we thank you for every upright and godly person in this house we especially pay tribute and honor every man of god under the sound of our voices we're not using the term man of god for pulpit ministry only but we're using that term for every man who has made the decision to follow the instruction of the lord may they be blessed today may they be honored and strengthened today may the holy spirit come and guide them and lead them and direct them if there are corrections to be made in their life send the word send the word lord to correct us wrap your arms around us and remind us o god that you are with us all the way even to the end we pray against every curse that might fall upon us by the wicked by the angry by the jealous by the resentful we thank you for raising up a standard we break every authority of every word curse and we come against all witchcraft against the saints of god and we thank you for your righteousness and your holiness your favor upon our lives we give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the saint said amen you may be seated i need just a little more in the monitor not in the house man who fears the lord this is not a cowering in the corner fear this is not fearing the white wigged one with hammer in his hand this fear the fear of the lord is reverential fear it's awe it's reverence it's standing in awe of the holiness and the authority of god and the bible said that a man who fears the lord who reverences the lord who worships the lord who delights greatly in the commandments of the lord that man is blessed what god blesses you should be careful about cursing is that right god said i'll bless those who bless you and i'll curse those who curse you you say he was speaking about israel well don't you know that you are the royal seed of abraham did you know that the promises of god made to the natural seed of abraham are yours by the covenant of grace you are grafted in i am grafted in and we have every right and when we hear a warning like we heard this morning from sister jaya's anointed song calling the sons of israel back to their god out from under the leadership of the queen of the land the jezebel spirit that rules our nation and that call of the spirit calling us back to come under submission to the god of israel that's not just to the jews that was the spirit of god calling you and i back to the god of our fathers come on all the way back to where we started this journey maybe we have grown and matured and we have experienced many things but sometimes we lose our first love and this is the way that god calls us back to that place of passion where when we say jesus i love you it's not just some words coming out of our mouth but there's passion in our voice and we're connected to that praise and i want to read psalms 128 verse 1 through 6. i'm not going to spend all my time today on fathers or ungodly men but i want to i want to use some of the time because we have some men here who are are worthy of honor and they should receive some of this attention that they're getting this morning they should get it more often but we want to take a moment this is psalm 128 and the first six verses start off very similar to the other blessed happy fortunate to be envied is everyone genderless who fears reveres and worships the lord who walks in his ways what is the difference between saying i love the lord and loving the lord it's the one who walks in his ways if we say we love the lord and we don't keep the instructions of the lord we lie bible said the truth is not even in us we have some kind of superficial idea of what it means to love the lord because when you love him you want to obey him and when you love him you want to please him and when you love him you want to round your tithe up instead of rounding it down you want to go the extra mile a friend of ours who was a female missionary to china and she was used in many nations of the world and she was sent on many occasion to speak to rulers of nations including a divine appointment with the king of nepal and the the leader of ethiopia holly salasi she was sent uh in an unbelievable way a way that reminds you only of the book of acts can you imagine god speaking to someone and saying today i want you to fly to to ethiopia to the airport and i want you to check in the closest hotel and i want you to wait for further instruction i don't know many men that would pack a bag but i i know a woman who did and regardless of what you might say about that he was using her in a tremendous way and this woman never married she is with the lord now and i met her because god showed me a vision of her face i had never seen her before to my knowledge and god showed me a vision of her face she reminded me of my grandmother much younger different color hair but the same kind of beehive or french twist and similar in size i later found out similar in voice but god showed me only a picture of her face and he said i'm going to give you a word for her and i'm going to give her a word for you there was a mobile home that sat on this property right here where the church is sitting today and that mobile home served for some time as an office for myself and we used it for storage because we've always had a lack of storage problem and that's because we have a pastor who's a pack rat and i admit it and uh will not likely change but anyway um [Music] it quickly became a place for refugees to stay and so we often have someone in there so i i never really got to use it for an office because i didn't want to disturb people you know there were people that would be in there and staying there and if i named names it would bring smiles to some of your faces and it would remind you that we've just been through it we've just been through it one of the men who lived there stole from us more than one of the men who lived there the one of the men who lived there stole from us and uh a lot and i called the police to him because that's what everybody said you have to do you must let people know or we'll never get this stuff back you've got to let the authorities know and so i did just that i called the police and then i rushed over here to tell him get out leave as fast as you can because i've called the police and they're on the way i knew he would be no good to any of us in jail i wasn't a ver i wasn't wasn't angry enough to to to let him go off and our little boys were playing that night they were involved in what was going on and uh they couldn't couldn't keep it from them i mean they were rushing around with us and benjamin and joshua and they're playing with their little cars and they said all right brother so-and-so get in the back of the police car here that's when you realize that ministers families know way too much but moving right along i was in the mobile home that day and and and for those of you that don't like where i'm going uh you need to know that there are people among us who actually ask me on occasion to tell more stories so i'm pleasing them today i'm telling a story i don't often remember to tell them but anyway i i had this in my mind who is this woman how will i ever find this woman i'm supposed to go and give her a word from the lord and she will have a word from the lord for me you see i believe in gifted people and i really like it when i can find someone gifted and also has integrity that's rare it's not rare to find gifted people but it's it's more rare to find gifted people with integrity you can say amen now anytime you want to and i was moving a box of old magazines from one closet to the next i just spent a lot of time just shifting my junk to keep it from going out the door and i had some antique nearly antique way back uh copies of charisma magazine which is a magazine for many years that has chronicled the pentecostal and charismatic happenings in the world and i i've read it i read it faithfully for years i haven't read one in a while now but i read it faithfully for years and i had some old copies that i had kept because somewhere in that magazine was something that was significant to me so i kept the whole magazine right even though i was told just clip what you want and throw the rest away i would keep the whole thing so as i'm moving this box the top magazine slides out onto the floor and the page opens the magazine opens and i go down to pick it up and there she is in the magazine it just shocked me well i just throwed myself right down in the floor and gave honor to god for showing me and then began the journey of how i would get to her now the reason why she was in that magazine is because her family had been hosting a pentecostal camp meeting for over 50 years and she had been living in israel for most of those years her brother who directed the camp had passed away and she had been invited to come back from israel and lead that camp that summer and so her picture was there as as director of this pentecostal camp and so i began to try to find out a little bit more about who she was and i found out she had written a book and i ordered the book and to my surprise as i'm sitting in the yard one day reading that book she begins to mention the sound of heaven on the voice of william branham when her and her family were in his meeting in richmond virginia and it so reminded me of what god had spoken to my heart about the first time that i heard the voice his voice and how i had known that god was using his voice to speak to my heart in a way that i'd never been spoken to before so it so captured and connected me to her that i began to make some phone calls and the story is too long to tell but the woman who answered the phone she began to to sort of prophesy to me on the phone i'm asking questions well when does the camp start and and who will be the speakers and she named only ladies and i said don't you all have any men preachers too and she just laughed at me like i'm just a nut oh she said sure we do but but but at the beginning there it's mostly ladies that are going to be speaking and i thought well i i would kind of be uncomfortable in in that kind of a situation i think to begin with i i've not been outside of my own circles in so long and i'm just kind of talking out loud and she said can i sing you a song i said uh well you know yes ma'am and she says let the river flow let the river flow holy spirit come come in power let the river flow let the river flow let the river flow and i was hooked my heart was hooked there was such an anointing that came across that telephone line i was hooked i didn't care what i was going to face when i got there i just knew that i needed to be there for those meetings she began to prophesy to me and she said the lord is going to do some things for you he's going to i don't want to say the things it doesn't matter i don't remember him all but she began to prophesy good things to me but here's where she really got me we had had a luncheon at the church a few services before and sister weems had decorated my place at the table with a little pot of my favorite flower pansies they're my favorite flower because they were my grandfather's favorite flower he loved them dearly and in my one of my first experiences in heaven i saw pansies there and i knew that my grandad had somehow connected to that flower because of its presence in eternity in fact when i saw those flowers there they had faces like a pansy does but very different these faces were faces and these faces followed me wherever i went i watched the flowers turn as i walked along the way now i'm telling you that will spook you you said you mean you're already having an experience uh like that and you're not already spooked no i wasn't it was quite common in those days but it really was a pleasant but but unusual feeling to watch everything so alive the blades of grass were so alive the flowers so alive as though they had personality as though they had passion you i tell you that will make a difference sister weems had had taken that little pot of pansies that she had potted and someone maybe not even her she placed it at my seat where i was eating but someone took it and placed it on the corner of my desk and i didn't even know it was there there are no windows in my office and so i rarely had anything living in there and this woman begins to prophesy to me and she said brother i don't want to offend you but i see you as a flower she might even be listening to this today i see you like a flower she said i know that's not what men like to think about themselves as but but i see you like a flower and she said frozen in the winter snow well no i didn't really want to think about myself as a flower and i didn't really want to think of myself as being frozen but she said no don't don't be offended she said because when the sun comes out i i see that little flower she said oh in fact just like that little pot of pansies on the corner of your desk there and so literally i'm on the phone like this reared back in my chair and i literally go and there they were she said just like that little pot of pansies there on the end of your your desk i see you like that all bowed over in the snow but when the s-o-n comes out and shines on you she said like those little flowers do in the winter she said i just see you turn in your face toward the sun she said can i sing for you again sure let the river flow this was the most unusual phone conversation i've ever had but god used it in a profound way my wife and i went and we didn't have the money to go and god used unusual circumstances to help us get there we we flew there and back round trip for 79 when we went to rent a car we rented a car for less than 50 bucks for the several days we were going to be there he gave us favor he sent unusual people to our house who normally wouldn't have been in excited about me going to a place where there were so many women preachers but god used some people like that to come and bring money and lay it on my hand and say god wanted me to help you get there many many confirmations came along i told all of that to tell you something she said she was never married she met gwen shaw who was a missionary in hong kong at the time they met each other as young holiness girls pentecostal girls who had a passion and a burden for the nations she fell in love and he wrote her on the mission field and god began to call her to a higher walk with him and he began to express more of how he wanted their life to be and she couldn't see the picket fence and she couldn't see the the quiet life her heart had already been touched by china she had already been touched by the hungry people in the nations of the world not always needing a preacher but sometimes just needing somebody to walk it out with them she didn't know how she would ever settle in to a normal life once the nations had got in her blood i'm telling you it's contagious when you feel the pull of the nations it's hard not to go it's hard not to be a part of that and so uh you know he it broke her heart but their relationship ended and she dedicated the rest of her life short life only in her early 60s she dedicated that to the lord she said some things that i will never forget and one of the things that came to my mind as i was sharing that i don't even know why i'm sharing this but one of the things that came to my mind was she said you know i once had a love and i you may think i'm not qualified to speak about that because i'm never married but she said when you love someone you want to discover who they are you want to know what they like follow me you want to know what they don't like you want to know what they prefer you you don't just fall in love with the with the features of a face she said when you really love someone you find yourself loving the oddest things about them the way they stand the sound of their voice and she said when you really love the lord it behooves you to to want to discover what he loves what brings pleasure to his heart what makes him glad what blesses him we sing bless the lord o my soul what really blesses the lord what really causes him to delight and she said like you would uh someone in the earth that you loved uh a boyfriend or some girlfriend she she said you you would want to find out what kind of pie he likes because you'd have this desire to beg for him but you wouldn't want to bake him a cherry pie and find out that he couldn't stand cherry pie and everyone knew that but you so you'd have to spend time with him is anybody following me you'd have to spend time with him and and discover over a period of time what he likes and what he doesn't like she said that's the way it is with the lord if you really want to please god you've got to find out what causes him pleasure you've got to discover what he likes and what he doesn't like and you stay away from those things that the lord doesn't like and when you find that there's a particular thing that brings him pleasure and the life that's what you want to do over and over again anybody hearing me this morning this is not a message just for women this is a message for us men it behooves us to discover what god likes and i've just read you a scripture that tells us what god likes he likes a man of integrity he likes a man of worship he likes a man of passion he likes a giver he likes someone who's generous who's willing to lend to those who have me who's willing to give to those who are more most unfortunate among us a man of compassion you know the world has a crazy idea of what a man's man is [Music] crazy idea they think it's something like how many knives he has on his belt or how many fires he's ever started with two sticks but i want to tell you something god has a different idea of what manhood really is he's looking for men that will walk and whoa i feel him walk in his commandments if you don't ever open the book you can't know what his instructions are god give us a passion for the word [Music] may we have strength to turn off netflix and get our faces in his book and discover what he wants from us in this hour like we sung last sunday there ain't no time for playing around it's lost or found it's hot or cold it's black or white it's choose the way of the lord or your own way but you can no longer do a little of both stand straddle the fence is anybody hearing me the lukewarmness that has gripped the church it must not be a part of the bride's life we weren't called to just be the church we're called to be the wife of the bridegroom the lord jesus christ so we need to discover what he likes i don't think it's a pie flavor we're going to find out about him but we're going to read the word and we're going to see that he likes men who handle their affairs with justice anybody listening am i getting too emotional this is a passionate subject for me men who don't cheat men who don't lie men who don't exaggerate and when they do they catch themselves and they say hey that might be a little bit of an exaggeration maybe the fish was this long instead of this long some things are too big to be an exaggeration they're just a lie anybody with me i didn't always go in here but here we are it's so important expecting somebody else to pay your way or to pay your families away when the bible tells us it's our responsibility as men i want you to know when i look around this room i see men who are not lazy and i see men who work not one job and more than one job to provide for their family instead of working one and allowing somebody else to bear the burden of taking care of their family they realize if one can't do it i'll have to get me another one and that doesn't mean that i can't be there for my children on top of all of the other i've still got to be there for my kids i want you to know the reason why some of these young men have grown up to be men like that is because it was the it was the behavior that was modeled for them they may not have had a father who was emotionally supportive but there are many people in this room who can say i had a dad that worked hard to provide for his family how many of you know that's valuable in this hour to have a dad who worked hard to provide for his family everything you see that your dad was lacking you have a grand and glorious opportunity to be what he was and so much more and god is calling us because we're not only casting we're not only responsible for our natural offspring but a man of righteousness and integrity who walks uprightly before the lord and follows the instructions of god he leaves in his wake spiritual seed he leaves behind him spiritual sons and daughters that he's also responsible for to walk upright and holy and set apart and sanctified and to remember that little things matter i want to tell you something i have told my family since day one details matter they matter they matter little details matter when you're telling something details matter when you're looking for something details matter it's important sometimes we we we have this tendency to cover up for ourselves [Music] we have a tendency to blame others for our own mistakes and i'm telling you god is raising up if you don't understand me if you think i'm here whooping me and i'm actually here raising them up god is raising up men who have no desire to cover up their sin who have no desire to cover up their shortcoming they just desire to bring all of that into the presence of the lord and see what god will do with it when you come to him bring it all somebody said but the lord said i can't ascend to the hill of the lord you come stand at the bottom of the hill and worship god with everything you have your warts your lack of integrity if you have it your anger issues your inferiorities your insecurities don't you let any of those things keep you from worshiping the lord if you can't worship on the holy heel you worship at the bottom of the holy hill and you say here i am lord with all my failures with all my sin with all my unbelief with all my hang-ups with all my slacknesses but i'm here to worship you and to call you holy and to call you god sovereign god sovereign god supreme the only true living god not three pieces of pie trying to function as one but one god functioning in three divine offices and many more expressions of who he is in the everyday life of the believer he's not looking for subjects he's looking for servants and there is a difference a subject will obey because his very life and substance depends on obeying the edict of the king but a servant a real son who chooses to be a servant he doesn't worship in fear he doesn't approach god afraid he approaches god with boldness knowing that there's a more perfect sacrifice that's crying out on his behalf you stand at the bottom of the hill and worship if that's all you can do until god cleanses your hand and purifies your heart and then you do like the scripture said get up don't stand at the bottom of the hill at cades barney forever there's a promised land jaya there's a promised land jennifer there's a promised land that we're supposed to take right now right here and now we're not calling heaven the promised land we're calling inheriting the promises of god now the promised land and god wants you to have that anybody with me psalms 128 blessed happy fortunate to be envied is everyone who fears reveres and worships the lord it's 1 16 who walks in his ways and lives accordingly to his commandments for you shall eat i want you to hear this for you shall eat the fruit of the labor of your hands you don't work you don't eat the bible said a man who doesn't provide for his own has denied the faith and is worse than an infidel i'm just telling what the scripture said you can't say you love god and be worse than an infidel when the infidel is that one who's a fool the bible calls him so you have a responsibility come on now and you learn that you learn that you you and maybe it wasn't modeled for you but you learn it you're not looking for the handout your real desire is let me get to the place where i can give somebody let me get to the place listen that that has been my own i've never this is the truth before god may he judge me in front of all of you i have never desired to be rich to be rich the only desire that i've ever had was to carry wealth to this extent i'm not there yet but i would love to carry wealth to this extent that i could write a check to meet a need and never have to consider what it would do to my next week or my next month god let it be so for some of us let it be so you know my granny used to say that god will only give you what he can trust you with and so i have recognized in my life that god can only trust me with a certain amount of things but i'm not satisfied with that i realize that i can keep proving my integrity and demonstrating my heart to him and he may absolutely bring me to the place that i would be able to do that just write a check just hear a need and meet that need and not have to worry about a bill to be paid come on now i can't tell you what it feels like to have come as far as i have come in the last few years to be able to say sometimes not every month but to be able to say by the 15th of the month that every bill that i owe for that month is already paid for by the 15th i dance a jig i dance a jig around my desk and i say thank you lord you have brought me so far i still carry credit card debt but i'm thankful that i'm not living on credit cards i'm thankful that god has brought us little by little by little by little by little out of that and i look forward to a day it may be in the last closing moments of my life or it may perhaps never be but i would very much like to be in that place where i could find the need and just meet it just meet that need and go on as quietly as possible not not even making a big to-do let me tell you something your works will praise you you don't have to praise yourself you don't have to be arrogant you don't have to brag on who you are i lost most friends in ministry close friends in ministry because uh uh their our fellowship was always one way i used to have a host of pastors call me every sunday night even after i was first married four or five pastors would call me every sunday night asked me how their servant how my service was and before i could answer would tell me for 20 minutes what happened in their service and how god used them it's hard to keep making those phone calls because i didn't want to push for my way i didn't want to push for my opportunity to testify because i realize if god does anything today it'll be him the best thing that you and i can do for god is show up and say yes just show up and say yes if we show up and say yes he can do the rest oh thank you ezekiel did you all hear zika clapping his hands for his preacher he's helping me for you shall eat the fruit of the labor of your hands happy blessed fortunate enviable shall you be and it shall be well with you oh there's so many things i want to see in my life that are not yet evident but i can tell you that it is a wonderful feeling as you know as many of you know to know that it's well with me it's well with you can you say it's well with me can you say it and mean it because you know that the the debt is settled there's no checking up to do on the account god has taken care of it it shall be well with you your wife shall be like a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of your house not at the bank not at the grocery store not here there and everywhere just just bear with me at your house i don't believe it's wrong for sisters to have some income i don't think it's wrong or sisters don't want to bless their family i can tell you that my wife who turned a passion into a business has been a great blessing five years ago or however long three year whatever it was i'd remember now honey night 2019 was it we 2015 what's been a long time no no our our cruise 2019 my dream go to alaska on a cruise always my dream you know what now i have another dream do it again you ever do it one time you won't do it again it was the most wonderful trip my wife paid for every penny of it out of her savings saving from her from her little job the bible tells us in proverbs of the virtuous woman that a woman is resourceful that way she does things in sales and mates so i'm not against that income but i'm telling you that it's it's it's a house in order when a young mother is at home with her children you don't have to i don't care if you get mad i'll be honest with you somebody were to get mad especially uh somebody that's not a part of this if you're a part of this group you know how i feel but if you're just hearing this on the internet you get offended and you're you you think i'm i'm a chauvinist or something no no no i'm telling you the highest honor that anybody could have as a woman would be the blessing that god would make a way for her to be home with her children to keep her home and to pour her life into her children that woman should be honored that woman should be highly praised and i'm so thankful that when god gave me a wife nearly 25 years ago he gave me a wife who said two things in her life i never want to be a preacher's wife and i never want to be a school teacher and she ended up being both she ended up being a pastor's wife and she ended up teaching our kids in school home school she only has one more to go mariah is the last one and when she's done well then we start on the grandchildren i guess i don't know we were going to have five if god would let us we were going to have five if god would let us but we she said to me one day honey if you really want to have five we will certainly try and put it in god's hands we almost did we came so close to just letting it be but we were getting older already it was nearly 30 when we married and she was just a few years behind us and we had benjamin right away nine months later and uh they were kind of close and along the way she said i i've been adding it up and if we have one now do you realize i'll be middle 60s nearly late 60s when when the last one graduates she said i just don't know if i have the patience for such as that we've just put it in god's hands is what we did we just totally put it in god's hands and it didn't happen but i thank god for a woman who was willing to do that i thank god for every sister in this church though you didn't want to do it you have dedicated your lives to educating your children at home and keeping them out from under the influence of this world and this secular education system and an hour when even the churches the christian schools are not so much better than the public school system because you've got same teachers same family same situations going on now it's a catch-all it really always was i ran a christian school in south carolina and i found myself feeling more like a truancy officer than the headmaster of a school because the calls that we got on a daily basis were from parents whose kids had been expelled and they wanted to fill up our school with children that had been expelled and i made a few exceptions and there's a there's a woman who comments on our stuff on facebook sometime who has thanked me again recently she said my son was one of those and you took a chance on him and he lives a good life with a good family today because you are willing to help him but there's no way in the world i could have done all of them i couldn't have taken them all in it would have overrun the atmosphere of our school and changed everything that we were doing thank god for the sacrifice that you mothers have make that's why these daddies sometimes have to work two jobs that's why these daddies sometimes have to moonlight is that what they call it and work extra hours and sell things and not have some things because they have to bear that responsibility and expense and in our nation homeschooling is very very expensive and they don't give us a deduction on taxes so we pay for other kids other parents kids to be educated in the public system and then we have to turn around and pay for our own but oh if that sounds like a complaint it is not a complaint i thank god that he's given us the blessing when i went to lewisville texas i don't know why i'm saying this when i went to lewisville texas to train at accelerated christian education dr lewis welcomed me i went for a conference three days before the school started and he's passed away now but he shook my hand and he said god sent you here baptist independent baptist and he said i want to talk to you privately for just a few minutes i never expected this kind of treatment and he said i want to ask you a question he said when god called those children of israel out of egypt and got them out there in the wilderness and they longed for the garlic and they longed for the cucumber and the leeks they longed to be back and have the food of egypt he said but one thing god was clear about he said you teach your children these commandments bind them like frontlets on your eyes come on now you teach your children and your children's children these commandments he said aren't you don't you see how things would have been different if they would have gotten their kids up every morning placed them on a school bus and sent them back down to egypt to be trained what a struggle those kids would have had trying to maintain the commandments of yahweh in the influence of that old world let me tell you something you'll you won't change my mind i want to thank god and when i honor the women for making the sacrifice i wonder i want the men to know they couldn't do it without you you should be praised here today you should be thanked and you should be celebrated and your kids may grumble and complain at times about it but one day they'll thank you one day they will thank you that they didn't have to be in that atmosphere anybody with me well i've got a real smart kid well i've got a real exceptional kid then you go to pray and you ask god to give you what you need to do what you need to do for them let the saints say amen okay go on your wife shall be a fruitful vine in the innermost parts of your house your children shall be like olive plants round about your table well i'm in israel and i have one of the greatest gods in all the world excuse me benny if you're watching you weren't guiding then but miriam fine v feinberg vamosh a friend of ours who lives in haradar just just up the hill from kyrie arim she guided us on our first journey through the land she's well known she's written all kinds of amazing books including a book about the foods of the bible and the times of jesus that's absolutely amazing and she has written a lot of the commentary for the brochures of of the of the tourism the national tourism board and you go to a biblical site she has written a lot of those brochures and she said come here pastor i think i had three children at the time and she said come here pastor i want to show you the scriptures in in in live i want you to see them alive and she took me to an olive tree and she said this olive tree it could be hundreds of years old we don't know how old it is but you can tell by the strength of the trunk and the the age of the tree but she said i want you to look at all these little tinder shoots and all the way around that old olive tree were these little tender shoots about this tall all the way around it and she said this is what olive trees do they branch out these these little and she said that's what the scripture is describing when it talks to you about being a fruitful vine and your children be being like little olive plants around your table it comes from the from the true uh behavior of the olive tree and i've never forgotten that behold thus shall the man be blessed who reverently reverently and worshipfully fears the lord may the lord bless you out of zion his sanctuary and may you see the prosperity of jerusalem all the days of your life yes may you see your children's children yes lord please lord peace be upon israel god said i want to bless these righteous upright men and i want them to have a good spread of children not 1.5 but as many as they can afford to take care of there's no scripture in the bible that tells you to keep having them so the government can take care of them excuse me amen brother you got to say the tough stuff too but you have as many as you can afford to have and raise them all up to serve the lord because one of these days the last gentile part of the predestinated seed of god is going to be expressed in the earth if it hadn't already come it's coming you be obedient to the lord in that manner don't you let this society shame you you stand up for yourself megan jovich when you get down to walmart with your baseball team they don't want to treat you right you stand up for yourself i hear you do can you imagine pulling up with a buggy your kids with you i assume they were with you some of them anyway all of them were worthy you pull up to pay for your groceries and can you imagine the clerk telling you i'm not going to check you out because you're not elderly or what disabled or elderly i'm not going to check you out you go over there to the self-checkout she finds it very very hard as anybody would i find it hard to check out on self-checkout because the thing yells at me all the time your item back pick your item up put your item over there don't it i don't know how many times i've ever got in and got out well i don't go to walmart but home depot or anywhere else i don't know how many times i've ever got in and got out without having to have a clerk very few they all have to come help me so they see me coming i think and just stand there ready to help me but can you imagine them telling you something like that you're not disabled and you're not elderly you're able to go over there like that sisters have told me for years when they go in two or three children that sometimes people look at them and say even three children are all those children yours do you see what society does they want to dictate everybody's life but the children of god are not like the rest of the citizens of this world we've marched to another drumbeat all together we're hearing the commandments of our father and desiring to live by those commandments hallelujah if you have one god bless that one if you have a dozen god bless that dozen but raise every one of them to fear the lord and make sure you can handle helping mold them into citizens of the kingdom of god and good citizens on planet earth or stop with two behold that man shall be blessed yes may you see your children's children peace be upon israel now i'm going to hurry because we got to go here i really was going to preach in my regular sermon material but i didn't get there yet first corinthians 4 14 through 17 is everybody okay anybody mad would you say it if you were we'll get the oil out first corinthians 4 14-17 amplified i do not write this to shame you but to warn and counsel you as my beloved children after although you should have thousand teachers guides to direct you in christ yet you do not have many fathers this is the condition of the world around us and this is the condition of the church world many teachers so many willing to teach you something they don't know but very few who are willing to be a father to the saints we need god to raise up men even among us who are not will who are willing to be more than a teacher by example but also a father to those who need a spiritual father i don't believe in looking to the pastor or leaders in the church as your natural father just because you don't have a relationship with your natural father i'm not encouraging you to do that especially sisters single sisters sometimes get that kind of thing in their mind and they're looking for a father figure i can't replace an earthly father whether you had one or not but i want to be a spiritual father to you i want to tell you the truth and more importantly than telling you the truth i want to live the truth in front of you because you will be an impression you will model what you see and what you hear we carry it on may god give us more fathers he said you you've got 10 000 teachers in christ yet you do not have many fathers for i became your father in christ jesus through the glad tidings of the gospel so i urge you i urge and implore you to be imitators of me what i'm not going to follow any man you do already everybody in this room is following a man one way or another there's always going to be somebody that has authority over your life whether it's your boss or your earthly dad or your spiritual leaders so it's just erroneous to say i'm not going to follow any man we do follow men we just have to follow the right man and that would be first and foremost the lord jesus christ and his word and those that he raises up before us may god make you if you're not sure may god help you to be sure if you're not sure who your pastor is you may god help you to be sure and i'll tell you like i've told people recently you don't have to go here you go where god sends you he's not going to send you anywhere where less of the gospel is being preached amen if he sends you somewhere he's going to send you where more of the gospel is being preached and modeled you're not going back into the denominational vomit that you came out of somebody ought to say man you're surely not going back into man-made systems but the first thing that god had to teach me in my early ministry was a hard lesson that i still struggle with today and that is i can't help everybody but god can and he's got a man somewhere that can help anybody that needs help pride this little lady back here and she may have known me longer than anybody in this room she stood on the street in downtown columbus with a son and a stepson i think i may be wrong is that right when i was preaching on the street at 17 years old she was in the crowd i've made hundreds of mistakes and thousands of mistakes but what we do is we just keep going on the best we can for christ and we follow christ first and we get a revelation of who's supposed to help us on the journey and then we get behind that with everything we've got didn't you hear brother branham say that you need a revelation of who your pastor is then you stick with him because he's ordained to take you over this pastoral thing is a serious thing when you call somebody your pastor it's not just a term of endearment it's a spiritual responsibility and a spiritual relationship that you're forming with that person and we need some spiritual fathers and not just one pastor but we need you you know you've got a spiritual father in brother greeley he's there to help you if you need to be helped now i want to put some statistics up if you happen to catch those you might not have i want to get these out of the way i'm running close to my time 63 percent of youth suicides are from fatherless homes a less than good dad in home is better than no dad i didn't say an abusive dad i didn't say an abusive dad i didn't say a dad who takes his anger out on his wife and children but a dad who knows he's not perfect is better than a dad a home where there is no dad so it's easy sometime to get rid of the dad not realizing the penalty and the impact that it has on the family and we're also living in a society where there are men who are who are uh you know searing babies uh uh spawning babies but have no responsibility to those babies and if it wasn't for what they're calling now somebody's baby mama which is usually a grandmother because even the baby mama who brings them into the world is not present to be able to raise them so in many many many cases it falls on an older generation to take care of the children thank god for the grandmas but it shouldn't have to be such a way as that but that's the hour that we're living in 85 of children that exhibit behavioral disorders are from fatherless homes 85 80 of convicted rapists have grown up in fatherless homes 80 71 of teenage school dropouts are from fatherless homes you tell me a father doesn't matter 75 percent of all youth and drug abuse sinners are from fatherless homes 70 percent of juveniles and state institutions come from fatherless homes 85 percent of youngsters in prison are from fatherless homes 70 of teen pregnancies are from fatherless homes isn't that hard to get your brain around so when we take a little extra time to honor a father it's not to say he's perfect it's not to say that he's without fault or mistake but it's to say if he chooses to stay your children are going to end up in a better situation with the father present than one absent anybody with me now brothers i want to tell you there are three common mistakes that we need to avoid if we want to be an example worth following there are many there are many but i want to give you these this morning a don't cover up your mistakes don't let your pride keep you from apologizing to your wife and children anybody with me on that men i don't i may be the only one being but i have had to backpedal i've had to set my family down and say i was wrong i didn't handle that right i wasn't looking at that right i have made a mistake or raise my voice when when the situation really didn't merit the exercise of that kind of volume i am not one who says that because a man raises his voice or a woman mother raises her voice that she's not a fit parent i don't say that at all i absolutely believe that there are situations and circumstances where it is vitally urgent and important to get someone's attention now so it will happen but there have been times that the situation did not merit that kind of outburst and i've had to set my children down and say i was wrong i am sorry i don't want to cover up my mistakes if you make a blunder in front of your children don't pretend like you didn't you say well they may not be old enough to understand it are you teaching them to say they're sorry when they do something that they shouldn't do or is that a part of your family it should be and it shouldn't just be as they get older i hope you're listening it shouldn't just be i'm sorry it should be why are you sorry what are you sorry for did you know a lot of times children get rebuked and disciplined for something and they're not totally aware of what they're being disciplined for that's not teaching that's not training they can get that from their boss they can get that from society but when daddy corrects them they need to be clear on why they're being corrected oh but that takes so long it does so you better factor that in when you're filling your quiver you want to factor that in especially if you're going to use physical correction that child needs to understand why you chose that for a punishment and let me remind you that public is not the place to execute that kind of discipline on your children or you'll be calling me from lockup there's a world out there that absolutely believes that it's okay for pedophiles to raise children but how dare you as a godly family swat yours on the rear end and let me remind you parents that god designed the body with a perfect spot he put extra pattern that's not their arm that's not their shoulder that's not their head that's not their face it's posterior pole to protoplasm it's putting it on the cushion doing it because you want to express the severity of a of a problem of a behavior not out of anger not out of anger real positive correction whether it's physical or not it doesn't come out of anger it has to come out of urgency and passion for the situation we've got to correct this now but we've got to do it calmly is everybody with me very very important don't snatch them they're not dogs with leashes they've got feelings real complicated feelings they don't have to be jerked and snatched to be disciplined will it happen yes will you grab them yes at times you will don't you look at me like that you will you say stand right here and i mean you better not leave will you grab an arm and pull it right back you certainly will but don't let that become your habit let me tell you something the goal in in training our children is to train them with our eye everybody with me just like him we want to come to a place with our small children that we train them with our eye and they know by the look and if that don't work mama's pinch i always told my mother mine's hanging down way before it should because of all them times you grabbed and mama didn't just do that oh no that would have been too easy she just kept on twisting till i was twisted in ways that i didn't know if i could untwist or not but she got my attention and i told you there was that one time when i saw a little little bruise that i was going to call the law only one time you all that knew my mom and you know she'd do it now she if she had the mind to do it she'd do it now if she wanted to she said well you just go right ahead let me get the phone because there's one thing for sure by the time it takes them to get here you will have had a reason to call them believe i changed my mind believe i won't call after all mom you convinced me don't cover up your mistakes brothers be real in front of your children i messed up i overreact did you know i overreacted doesn't mean that you are saying that what you said or did was wrong it means the way you handled the situation was wrong did you know you can be right in your motive to correct but wrong in your demonstration of that correction so sometimes you're not apologizing because you got corrected you needed it but i was not proper it was not right the way i don't cover don't cover up your mistakes b don't criticize others while the children are watching there's always something you can say about everybody right sometimes they deserve it even but your children should not be forced to deal with adult situations that they may not have the full brain processing power to be able to sort it out it reminds me of the story of brother branham when he was riding along there with brother greene and they were passing verde valley and and he began to speak about the what it what had been going on with the two tape brothers the two tape boys and brother branham was being quite critical because sometimes in leadership of ministry things have to be spoken quite clearly anybody understand what i mean brother greene brother branham knew exactly why he was sharing the seriousness of of these situations with brother green but it got a little overboard for brother green's comfort zone because he had always heard that brother branham never said a negative word about anybody which would be a gross exaggeration for most people on the planet yet you hear people say that but anyway but this was brother uh green's impression brother branham and brother branham is kind of getting a little coarse here and he's just really laying it on thick and brother green is just listing real careful not to say too much and they go on and do what they're going to do and they're coming back through the same area and they're getting back stopped at the same little gas stop and they're getting back in the car to finish the drive on down to tucson and ah brother green brother branham looks at us watching he said oh brother perry if we had a little more time we'd go over and see the boys brother green said i i just couldn't i just couldn't let that pass he said brother brandon what do you mean when we were passing through here on the way up you told me about all the sins and all the messes that those brothers were making and how they had done it all wrong and how it had brought reproach even on your ministry and what needed to be done to kind of straighten that out and now you're saying if we had time we'd go by and see the boys and he said i just don't understand that brother branham and brother branham said brother perry i'm surprised at you brother greene said this to me multiple times he said the nerve of him he said that's how i felt the nerve of him me i'm surprised that you you're the one that had so much to say about him and i'm the problem he said why they're still our brothers there may be something necessary there may be something true there may be some reason at times why something should be said to our children because we don't want to leave them clueless in a situation that they may have to face sometimes a family leaves the church we're afraid to tell our children they really ought to know you don't have to go into all the details but you might ought to let them know so they don't wonder but in most situations you should be very careful put the list up for me again would you you should be very careful that you're not criticizing other people while the children are watching and most importantly listening which means mom and daddy have to talk when they are so exhausted they can hardly stand up because that's way after the day is over and the children are in bed and you're both ready to sleep but there are things that need to be said in that kind of a private situation if you understand what i'm saying you can say amen and the last one see don't maintain a fake front be yourself fathers daddies men of integrity be yourself don't be a phony don't be somebody you're not don't get off a podcast and think you've got to be like somebody else you be who god has created you to be who god has built you to be who god has made you to be and be honest about that and don't don't deceive your children into thinking and whatever you do don't be one person at church and another person at home do i have just a few more minutes if you need to slip out you can i want you to go to job 1 5 i don't know what i was thinking that i would ever get back to my sermon and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all he's speaking about his children so this is job rising up early in the morning sanctifying his children now how does the father sanctify his family by bringing them apart in prayer by laying them on the altar before the lord setting them apart unto the lord and praying over them and the bible said that job even offered burnt offerings according to the number of his children so he not only sanctified them in prayer after they had been on this feast they lived in pagan land and they were influenced by the pagan feast and job wanted them to know that you may be living in the world but you shouldn't be a part of the world and so he went to god the day after it was over and he sanctified his children in prayer and he laid them on the altar before god and then for each of them he made a burnt offering unto the lord this is this is serious work he offered a special offering unto the lord for every one of his children for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed god in their hearts why because of their participation in this pagan feasting that was going on in their neighbor in their land in their in their region it may be that my children have sinned and cursed god in their hearts and i want you to notice how dedicated job was to crying out to god for his children i hope you'll hear this brothers you can't leave all the praying to mama [Music] you can't leave all the teaching to mama i hope every one of you will recognize your responsibility to lay your children on the altar every single day i don't care if they've got children of their own they may even have grandchildren of their own god gave them to you for a reason and he wants you to be able to take that opportunity to go before god on their behalf i do i have to because i've learned like you've learned there's no limit to what can happen in a 24-hour period i can't afford to let days go by that i'm not laying my children on the altar before the lord and if it is in such a circumstance that you cannot teach your children and you have to send them out of the home to be educated don't you dare do it without anointing their head with oil and praying over their life that god will keep them and protect them and watch over them lest they fall victim to the influence of the society around them and job took it so serious he did it over and over and over again are you with me i know it's late job was aware of the potential impact the society around him was having on his children job knew that his children needed a priestly intercessor and job knew that it wasn't just the pastor's place job knew that as a father he had a responsibility to cry out to god jehovah for his own children we're living in a far worse condition today than the condition of life in job's day can anybody say man and if there was a fear of society having an influence on his children then how much more should we be concerned about society around us having an influence on our thank god i want to thank god for men in this house i want to thank god for daddies in this house that aren't afraid to bow their knee before the lord and call their wife's name before god and their children's name before the lord you're the man of integrity you're the hero not some crazy basketball player some a hollywood star some hero out there in the world who's done something good or hit a home run or kicked a field goal or or touchdown or whatever they do let me tell you something these are men fallen men unless they know jesus as their savior but if you've got a daddy that's calling your name before the lord if you've got a daddy like some of them in this house that are praying with their little girls or their little children before they go to bed at night they're having a prayer with them if you've got a daddy like that you've got something to be thankful for well come on now we we ought to celebrate so it's a it's it's a it's a must that every father in this place not only be celebrated for doing so but be called to accountability to be the priest in our own houses and they're out from under our roof all we can do is what job did we go and sanctify them before the lord we lay an offering before god on their behalf but when they're out from under our roof and authority benjamin said dad i i know better than to think that because i live up the hill you're still not going to tell me what ought to do i said you're right i'm still going to be there to be a voice in your life the longest day you live on planet earth or the longest day i live on planet earth i'm still going to have a voice i'm going to let you learn a few things that i didn't have the courage to teach you but i'm going to have a voice in your life just because they're out of our house doesn't mean we don't have a responsibility to lay something on the altar on their behalf and i'm closing i really am i want to give you four responsibilities very quickly not gonna elaborate on any of them much four responsibilities four priestly duties that every father needs to participate in in their family life number one intercessor that's what job was being an intercessor going to god for his children for his wife let me tell you something the best thing that a father could do for his wife a husband can do for his wife is pray for her call her name before the lord if she is not what you need her to be go to god cry out for her help she may be so so frustrated with her own self that she doesn't begin to know how to make any change in her life but if god is called if god is is implored if if you intercede to god he can step in and give her the strength to be what you need her to be mistreating her is not an option life and ministry of jesus shows us that intercession is an essential duty of every priest number two a father must be an instructor instructing is another essential of a priest central duty of a priest in the old testament times in addition to prophets priests also have served as the voice of god to the people there will be times that as a dad in your home you will be the voice of god to your family that is a huge responsibility may god strengthen you to be that if you have no children in your home then you but yet you're married and you have a wife you are at times the voice of god to your wife that's a serious serious responsibility number three we should be examples someone made the comment example is nobler than advice it's one thing to give advice it's another thing to lead by example may god help everyone wouldn't that be the desire of every dad in this house it's my desire as a dad and a spiritual dad to lead by example a leader jesus is not just our great high priest but he is also the ultimate model for all leadership it flows out of who he is two quotes one from a super sign you're going to wonder why i've chosen them this morning not one word is spoken about father's day he said it's predicted again malachi 4 that it'll return again there will be a supersede rise up there's got to be something stand up that's got backbone and christian integrity certainly that will take this jezebel religion that's been pushed even into our pentecostal groups powerful isn't it jaya somebody will stand with christian spirit and fire with the holy ghost behind it to prove that it's right it's very likely he's referring to his own ministry but i want you to be reminded that in the beginning of this i told you the word seed is both singular and plural and i want to remind you that one man cannot be the voice to every person from generation to generation to generation and god is looking for men and women who will stand for righteousness with integrity and holiness in this hour with spirit and fire and without any compromise we are representing the message which is the revelation of jesus christ he said it shall be light in the evening time and he will restore the faith of the children back to the pentecostal fathers away from their dogmas and creeds it's got to come and it will come in the name of the lord it will come not only in his ministry but it must also be present in the bride's ministry can you say amen musicians are coming come with a song in the message and knoweth it not paragraph 287 it starts with oh god oh god that's like the pulpit where is man man that's man that stands for a principle maybe i didn't give it all oh oh i see where is woman women that stands for a principle where is a church that stands for a principle i ain't got a nicholsworth can you understand that southern vernacular i ain't got a nickel's worth of time for a wishy-washy give-in compromising spirit a woman is a woman let her be a lady if a man is a man let him be a man if he's a president where is our john quincy adams is not being paraded through the public stumbling off of bicycles where is our john quincy adams's where is our abraham lincoln's men of principle where is our patrick henry said give me liberty or give me death where is a man that stands for what's right where is the man that's not afraid to speak out regardless the whole world's against him speak out for what's right and stand for it and die for it who sees the need for this kind of firmness in the land we're living in now the hour that we're living in where is our our arnold von wickards again today where is men of integrity that's the man who is credited for saving switzerland where is men of integrity where is men with spirit not spirits they're so wishy-washy and gumped up gummed up until they don't know where they stand if you looked around and saw our world this is what you'd see everywhere men who don't want to stand for anything and if you don't stand for something you'll fall for everything but there there is there will always be a people maybe in the minority but there will always be a people who stand for the instructions of god's word who upright themselves who allow the lord to clothe them in his righteousness and they will not be silenced in compromising times like the one we're living in i want you to look around we have no idea what we will face before the rapture of the church and i want you to look around this morning i want you to get to know one another and i want you to make very sure that these are the kind of men and women you would want to face the uncertain end times having around you you wouldn't want to face the uncertainty of the end times with men who have problems with authority because in those pressing moments in a life or death decision must be made i want you to know that every time you come to church there's somebody here that's ready to defend you if you need to be defended in the spirit and if you needed to be defended in the physical you are defended when you come to church here when someone comes in that we don't know we immediately begin to try to find out who that person is and if people are offended by that i don't really care but don't you want people to come we absolutely do but we want to know especially when men come in shifting and acting strange that we don't know we start asking who is that do you know that person can you find out who that is and why they're here and who knows them somebody said i just think that's fearful no it's actually a little bit practical and i want you to know that anytime you're in a service here there is more than one person who is ready to physically defend you if you needed to be physically defended and they are prepared to take out the threat before too much damage could be accomplished are you really bragging about that no not at all but it's a constitutional right one that i really believe is important for the hour that we're living in in this nation this would not apply to other nations because they're not in the position that we're in but we're in a very hostile environment right now where people are targeting churches as they did the one in vestavia hills this week 70 something year old man it's a serious hour so yes i want to know that i'm in a place that to the best of their ability they can offer me some some physical help some physical protection from whatever i'm but i also want to know that i'm in the trenches with people that i can trust spiritually you get to know one another then you make a decision about whether you're going to a church where you feel that you can really trust the people that you go to church with because i want to tell you something we've got to know that if there should ever come a time that we come down to not being able to buy or sell for even a short period of time before the rapture we would want to know that we go to church with people who are not selfish but who are willing who desire to provide for their families first that's your responsibility but who would be very very willing oh you're listening to me now i should have led with this but who would be very very willing to share their bread they wouldn't be wagging their finger at us and saying you should have prepared you should have prepared you should have prepared but would be willingness i want you to know i know for sure you've got to know for sure i know for sure you've got to know for sure that i go to church with people who if i were in a crisis one that we have do not see coming i feel so thankful and so confident that i'm surrounded in this little house by people who would have my best interest at heart and who would make sure that if there was a need in my family they would be more than willing to try to help meet that need and i want to do the same for yours because we don't know what the future holds we saw churches closed and edicts made and we were much more blessed in this area than many places in this country but we know people in canada who are still dealing with the charges and the fines and the crimes that have been lodged against them because they continued to have church some of them had service outside and were arrested and the fees the the legal fees are mounting up to be millions of dollars now that they're having to pay to defend themselves against their own government because the government come and made an edict that was not in the good interest of protecting someone's religious freedom those people are having to rally together they're having to give to one another they're trying to help each other it's vitally important for you to begin to recognize that there are men and women sitting around in this house that if we should go to hard times we could go there together with the assurance of knowing they wouldn't be fly by nights and when the going got tough they'd be here to help us get through it well you certainly are talking about the senior men what senior men our senior men most of them brother reed have gone by the way of the grave we've said goodbye to our granddaddies and our and our senior men we can't wait for these men to get old we have to begin to see the value in their life right now i want you to know there are men in this house right now that if i had to go into uncertain times tomorrow i would be so thrilled and so blessed and so confident to know there's some of them sitting on this platform today that i would not be afraid to go into the uncertainty of the end time with men like that in my in my corner on my team i know that not only do they pack but i know that if i was hungry they would share what they had and of course if they didn't i would remind them of all the years i fed them and now their children we are blessed we may not have a lot of older men in this house but we are blessed because we have men of integrity fathers who love their children men who are going to stand for the truth what a blessing it is let's stand together this must go down in the history books is one of the strangest sermons you've ever heard but may god use it somehow to speak to your heart and thank you all you precious people from around the world that are wishing me a happy father's day thank you so much one of the happiest days of my life was the day that i became a father that's a truth there's nothing in this world like it never dreamed that i would be so blessed but god allowed it to be he gave it to us he allowed it i did not know and discern and understand the love of an earthly father but i have to tell you i've had the best papa i've had the best father i've had the best daddy he has been the best daddy that i could ever hope to have always in my corner loved me both with an embrace and with a swot on the seat when i needed it that's him that's him he's been so good he's a good good father what are you going to sing good sing it he's a good good father if you need to slip out we understand the rest of us are going to worship the lord for just a few minutes oh i've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're alike but i've heard a tender whisper of love in the dead of night and you tell [Music] it's who you are it's who you are it's who you are and i'm loved by you it's who i it's who am am it's who i am [Applause] oh i see many searching for answers [Music] jesus

covet that's going around and you don't want to come then that's your business but i want to invite every father that will to come and just stand over here on this side and we're just going to lay hands on you together as a group of men and we're going to pray come if you're coming now come now if you're coming so we'll know this is the safest place to stand right now i assure you of that if

have you brothers to lay hands on one another's shoulders right now just just get up close and you brothers there that are not fathers you lay your hands on them because this was a message for everybody men and women to stand but we want to especially pray right now over these men who are fathers i want us to lift our voices right now i want us to ask god to strengthen these men to stand on his word like they never have before and to leave their families with with with integrity and with righteousness but with such wisdom because in the hour that we're living in wisdom is so necessary and needed in a world that lacks it so god we pray right now for these precious men of god we have confidence in their lives we say that without apology we have confidence that they love you lord and their life has testified that their desire is to live a life pleasing to you and now it is our absolute joy it is our absolute pleasure to be able to pray one for another and ask o god that you would strengthen each of these men from the top of their head to the soles of their feet fill them with the wisdom of the lord fill them with the wisdom of the lord may they walk with such self-control with such temperance in this hour may they be ready to do what you call them to do but may they do it lord in the way that you would instruct in the way that you would lead may we follow your example in this hour may there be no compromise among us may we stand straight as an arrow on the word that has been delivered to us in this day may we o god lead others may we recognize that you have not only given us earthly children but you've given every one of us a sphere of influence that includes spiritual children may we not let them down may we stand for them may we not just desire to be teachers for them but may we be fathers for them i ask you right now to break off everything the enemy all the guilt that the enemy tries to put on daddies in this hour for every failure they've ever made i ask you to let that guilt break off of their lives right now and may they raise up with a fresh determination [Music] in the name of jesus the lying accusations of hell we break them off and we ask oh god that you will renew their confidence in you and that you will let them see oh god who you are in their life we pray for those who are not yet fathers but will be we pray o god that you will keep
