their hearts as a treasure and a gift from God to share with one another they also bring their dreams and their individual callings which bind them together today in an eternal commitment they bring their gifts and talents their unique personalities and Spirits which God will unite into one being as they build their lives together we Rejoice with them and we are thankful to the Lord for creating this Union of hearts that was built first on friendship respect and then love it's been a personal joy for me to know ginger for a very long time she has persevered through many difficult circumstances and endured numerous disappointments to stand before us today ready to embrace yet another exciting challenge one that her heart has longed for many years Ginger you pushed and pulled and fought your way to go back to school and earn a degree perhaps so that you could always provide for yourself and then an incredibly amazing thing happened that was far more important than a career Ginger you bravely stepped up quite a few years ago to willingly change the trajectory of a beautiful little girl's life that little girl Olivia is now a treasure to all of us and in fact she's no longer a little girl but is growing into a dear young lady right in front of our eyes Ginger I'm so thankful to know that she will always be a priority in your life and I'm thankful that a consistent and godly male influence will now be an added benefit in her life Ginger I'm so happy for you today you deserve love and happiness brother Eric it's hard to believe that we have known each other for nearly 20 years in those 20 years I've never heard you complain about anything or criticize anyone and despite what some people think you are more than capable of a long and engaging conversation I've spent time with you in Iceland at the fs and the waterfalls and up and down the hills of Jerusalem and all that I've ever known about you is utmost integrity and godly character when the Lord reached out for you he made the incredible difference in your life and you have sacrificially given him your all and you served God the ministry Christian television and others you mentioned to me one time years ago that you would still love to have a wife and family my dear friend and brother today is that day Ginger and Eric before the found foundation of the world our loving father had both of you on his mind he knew even before you were born that you would at different times choose to make Jesus the Lord of your life and by his forn knowledge of you he predestinated you both to be conformed to the image of his son he then allowed you to hear his salvation call individually and independently of each other and with a heartfelt yes you responded to his wooing the word predestin destination speaks of having a predetermined Destiny one that was chosen for us a plan that we may sometimes stray from however the destiny is so predetermined by God that he consistently reaches out to us through his Spirit urging us to correct our paths and realign our lives with his perfect plan with his perfect will I believe that the two of you have walked your destiny out as individuals to this point in your life life I also believe that the two of you realizing that you cared for one another and then falling in love with each other and eventually feeling that you wanted to spend the rest of your lives together it might have caught some of us by surprise but it did not catch God by surprise in fact it appears that he had this in his mind all along that this day is a part of God's great big plan the vows that you will soon make before our creator and in the company of those who love you so much will serve as a ceiling to what God is destined for our for your lives on this day February the 15th 20125 not just two people but two Destinies come together no longer separated and with nothing or no one to divide them or to stand in their way God's predetermined will and plan hands now intersect intertwine this marks the spot where two Destinies become one and God is pleased that you have chosen to walk out his plan for your lives together as your Stateside Pastor who loves you both dearly I bless this day and your future together in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Apostle Paul gave us all the best advice in a letter that he wrote to the Ephesians Church concerning the marriage in chapter 5: 21 submitting yourselves to one another in the fear of God wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body therefore as the church is subject to Christ so let the wives be subject to their own husbands in everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify it and cleans it by the washing of Water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it would be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as our own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hat hated his own flesh but nourish nourisheth it and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and these two shall be one flesh this is a great mystery Paul said but I speak concerning Christ and his church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself self and the wife see that she reverence her husband Ginger and Eric as you now prepare to take your vows give careful thought and prayer for as you make them you are making an exclusive commitment one to the other for as long as you both shall live your love for each other should never be diminished by difficult circumstances and it is to endure until death Parts you as God's children your marriage is strengthened by your OB obedience to your heavenly father and his word as you give God complete control of your marriage he will make your home a place of joy and a testimony to the world around you Ginger and Eric you are giving yourselves to each other in unselfish love you will make a solemn vow to each other a deliberate promise that come what may for better for worse in sickness and in health you will be true and faithful to each other this service is far more than the exchange of a solemn vow it is one of blessing it is the it is only with God's help that you can steadfastly keep the promises that you will make to each other today our savior is here to bless and to guide you he will always be by your side I charge you both as you stand in the presence of God to remember that if steadfastly you seek to do the will of your heavenly father your life will be full of peace and joy and the home which you are establishing will abide through every ch challenge give of yourselves to each other deeply freely and generously ever recalling the words of the poet who said love ever gives forgives outlives and ever stands with open hands and while it lives it gives for this is Love's prerogative to give and give and give a marriage is not 5050 it's giving 100% of who you are to each other and asking God to come and help marriage is a relationship of two persons that are not always at their best even in moments of human failing I counsel you always to do your best to act in love and compassion to one another sharing the spirit expressed in the scripture we read be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another your love for each other must be nurtured until it attains to the state of perfect love which is intended by God for his chosen bride we're going to now take a moment to focus on the one who has been so good to all of us feel free to stand with us if you like we want to give just a few moments of worship
