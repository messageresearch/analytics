you all so very much we appreciate you for the gifts that you allowed God to use for us today Acts chapter 17 again we welcome all of you into the house of the Lord if you're able to would you stand with us while we read the scripture acts chap 17 starting in verse 16 all the way through the end of the chapter now while Paul waited for them at Athens his Spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews and with The Devout persons and in the market daily with them that met with him then certain philosophers of the epicurian and of the stoics encountered him and some said what will this blabber say other some he seems to be a set or forth of strange Gods because he preached unto them Jesus and the resurrection and they took him and brought him to AR aroop saying may we know what this new doctrine is whereof you speak for thou bringest certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things mean for all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing then Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill and said you men of Athens I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious for as I pass passed by and beheld your devotions I found an altar within this inscription to the unknown God whom therefore you ignorantly worship him I declare unto you God that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is Lord of Heaven and Earth dwelleth not in temples made with hands neither is worshiped with men's hands as though he needeth anything seeing he giveth all giveth to all life and breath and all things and hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the Earth and hath determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the Lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as certain also as of your PO own poets have said for we are also his offspring for as much then as we are The Offspring of God we ought not to think that the godhead is like under gold or silver or stone Graven by art or man's device and the times of this ignorance God winked at but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent because Heath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given Assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead and when they heard of the resurrection of the Dead some mocked and others said we will hear thee again of this matter so Paul departed from among among them how be it certain men clave unto him and believed among the which was dianus the AR agapite and a woman named deeris and others with them may the Lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you can have your seats today now it's been two weeks since I've been in service with you traveled a few miles since I've been here but glad to be back among you and all of you are welcome here in the service and we just want to see what the Lord would speak to us here in this service God met us in the camp meeting but the camp meeting is passed today is a new day and God is continually unfolding himself and we want want to receive anything that he would speak to us now uh In this passage of scripture Paul is found himself in Athens he had gone to uh thessalonica and had with him uh he had Timothy and he had Silas the scripture gives them different names along the way uh Silas is also when you read the book of Thessalonians you find that his name becomes sylvanus but that is also Silas and timotheus is timoy but these two men were with Paul in thessalonica and and it seemed like everywhere Paul went he stirred up trouble it it wasn't his intention but Paul had received such a transformation from the hand of God till that wherever he went he was stirring up trouble now the the the reason that he stirred up trouble was because Paul at one time was a devout Jew and when he was a devout Jew and he started seeing all these Christian Believers he saw them in such a way till that he hated them this Jesus that came on the scene uh dis erupted all of the plan of the Jewish Scholars all of the Jews that had some prestige in the temple it it disrupted the plan that was going on there because all of the people that these Jewish Scholars the rabbis all of these men they thought that they had a captive audience and that they would never lose them these were men who planted fi fear in the [Music] people preachers that planted fear in the people if you ever leave my church you're lost and Paul was a part of that yes he was a part of that clergy that put such a fear in the people that if they ever left a particular synagogue or a particular doctrine of the teachers that they were sure to be uh uh black marked in some way or another until that they could never uh have a fellowship again but the fear that those clergy had over the people was broken when Jesus Christ stepped on the scene and he had a such a message of Deliverance until that it broke woke the spirit of fear over the people the scripture tells us in the New Testament that God did not give us the spirit of fear man has a tendency to do that to put fear in the people but God did not give us Fe fear he gave us power he gave us love and he gave us a sound mind so if you feel powerless today or if you feel afraid or if you feel like that your mind is not sane God did not put that there God gave us such a cleansing and such a power from on high that we can walk free from the power of fear from the power of feeling powerless we can walk in the Holy Spirit to such a measure such a degree till all of that is broken out of our lives that is exactly what we are trying to preach in these last days that the people will not walk under the fear of the past as we heard in cam meeting that we don't have to remain feeling dropped or forgotten in any way but that the spirit of the Lord would come in such a way until that when we feel friendless that we know that on the inside abides a friend that sticks closer than a brother I just pondered about feeling friendless or feeling ousted or feeling like nobody likes me as I was reading this scripture about Paul because Paul when he was a part of that Jewish sect with the San hedrin and the Pharisees and he was looked up to he had a lot of prestige he had a lot of friends he had a lot of people whom he was well respected by them and they would come to him for counsel and they would come to him and say Paul or Saul at the time what do you think about this scripture what do you think about this thought and and he was one of those where that he was building those extra fences out there to try to keep the people in line and keep them in fear but when he met the Lord Jesus Christ on his way to Damascus and he had such a transforming experience with the Lord that it changed all of his clout with all of the Pharisees it changed all of his friendships it changed everything because now the one that had been chasing the Christians now became the chased and all of those people that he thought were his friends they were no longer calling him friend and Paul became an outcast to all of those to all of that crowd that he had been with and God started putting different people back in his life but all of that comfort and all of that uh feeling of security that he had had before it was all gone right now you talk about a guy that felt friendless you talk about a guy that felt ousted a guy that felt like that nobody cared about him the Apostle Paul when he was being chased by this one and chased by that one and put in prison and put on a ship when he told him you better not sail it because we're going to end up in shipwreck but they didn't listen to him and so he had to ride out the storm with the rest of them but God gave a promise they'll not be any loss of life no loss of life so Paul kind of he kind of felt friendless but as he submitted himself to the will and plan of God and preaching Jesus Christ and him crucified and not just crucified but Resurrected yes and when he preached this kind of a Doctrine everywhere he went he was stirring people up because everywhere he went he didn't go to the first church of the nazarenes he didn't go down to the United Methodist Church he did not go to Word of Life or New Hope he didn't go to this one or that he went to the synagogues where were the Jews Jews in the synagogues because Paul had a compassion for his own people because he recognized that they were as lost as he was they were as far away from God as he had been until he met Jesus on the road to Damascus and he fell off of his high horse and fell on his face before the Living God and he said who who are you Lord who are you Lord now this is difficult for us to understand sometimes because Paul was one of those who studied all of the time he studied in the synagogue and he tried to give the people plenty to think about and he was always giving out words he was was an eloquent preacher he was able to dish out the words all the time and he was doing the best he could with what he had to work with but he needed a born again experience with the Lord Jesus Christ now he didn't have the opportunity to walk with all the disciples while Jesus was on the earth and uh in the book of Acts we can find that he was even one of those who uh was standing there as a young man and he he was a zealous kind of a guy the Bible tells us that when Steven was preaching that Paul saw of Tarsus he was holding the coats of these other men as they were casting the stones and little did Paul know that he was about to have a lifechanging EXP experience when God got a hold of him and he started preaching to these people wherever he went so when he gets to thessalonica he starts preaching to these women and uh some of them they believed and others of them they didn't like what Paul was preaching and even to the point that there was one Believer by the name of Jason and they went into his house to to try to escapee some of the chaos that was going on in the streets and and the the people started uh getting a hold of Jason and drugg him to court and Jason had to pay a fine they let him go but the Bible tells us that because of all of this chaos that Paul ends up leaving thessalonica and he goes to Athens Athens Greece and while he's in Athens he didn't go find a hole to hide in right now he left behind Silas and Timothy in thessalonica and he left behind people wanting to take him out and so they felt that it was better for Paul to go on to Athens and so as Paul goes to Athens while he was there the Bible said that his Spirit was stirred up within him now this is really the way that we should be today but we sometimes have been backed into the corner and we are told we've got to be more gentle we've got to be more politically correct we have got to uh treat people with kid gloves because as we read every day in the news this is a woke generation well I don't know what they're woke to but it ain't the gospel and they need to be woke to the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ and Mambi pambi Christianity is not going to get it now I understand that we'll never be able to shove it down people's throats because at the end of the day you can't see it unless unless God opens your eyes but it did not keep Paul from preaching it did not keep Paul from telling about the Lord Jesus Christ and while he's in Athens his Spirit was stirred in him because the people were wholly given to idolatry now this is where a preacher could get himself in a heap of trouble because Paul was out in the streets his Spirit was stirred within him because he was in Athens Greece and idolatry was all around him but we get into trouble even inside of the church these days if we start talking about the idolatry of the people inside of [Music] here but we are all facing these situations where Through The Years God has had to deal with the idolatry in our lives right whether it be things that we wear things that we participate in or things that pull us away from the Living God and capture our attention more than the attention that we give to the Lord Jesus Christ tomorrow is a holiday in the world old Halloween and we have seen such idolatry creep into churches around this message of truth I'm not even talking about denomination I'm talking about churches that say they believe this truth and yet they participate in this demonic holiday called Halloween and they they they dress up and they go and do particip a in all of the things that the world does now friends why why why would we participate in something that people who have come out of Satanism tell us that it is a demonic holiday and that it is all got demons all embedded in it why would we still participate in it because these things have become Idols in our life I ask the question why why do people go to the store and buy creepy looking things and they buy this St I don't even know what it's called but it's to represent a spiderweb and they put it all over their house I just want to tell you if I walk through the woods I want a stick in my hand to knock the spider webs down I don't really want to encounter the spiders why would I add some to my home it's ridiculous to me and it's a participation of the dark side of things until that we as Christian Believers if we say anything about it even in the modern church we get uh really Stones Throw us not maybe literally but people don't like to hear it because they don't like their idolatry to be preached about but that is what it is it is idolatry because it is participating in another kingdom other than the kingdom of the Living God and we've got to break down every Idol in our life because the Lord is calling to us for a total separation from all our unbelief all of it is there still some in me yes there is I don't like to admit that but I am still here fighting the battle with you and I realize that there's unbelief in me and I cry out to the Lord I believe help my unbelief help me with my unbelief I don't want to be an unbeliever in any way I want to look into the scripture and I want to find what belongs to me and I want to say yes Lord I want the same response that those that have been before me have said in the word of God every promise is yes an amen I want that to be me I don't want idolatry in my life I don't want I don't want the Christmas trees I don't want the earbobs I don't want any of that stuff I want all of this I idolatry to be out of me because I know that it is a participation of another kingdom other than the Lord Jesus Christ now Paul he is speaking to these Athenian Believers uh or to the Athenian people rather his spirit is stirred up inside of him because he recognizes that they are just idolatrous people they're serving all kinds of things the Bible tells us that that it looks like uh in verse 29 that they are looking at this and they have Idols of gold and silver and stone and man's device Graven by man's device people want something that they can see this is the reason why that we fight with one another right because we want to see what we're fighting somebody does us wrong and we start fighting with them because it is the one that we can see who brought the offense against us and so therefore we start fighting with them right whereas it is not them but it is Spirits at work that people have succumbed to all of us guilty but as a brother said after I preached on Thursday night he said did you ever notice when je when when they were just reviling Jesus that he didn't open his mouth why did he not open his mouth because he knew he wasn't fighting with people he was dealing with spirits and principalities and Powers it's the same way with people wanting a God that they can see you go to all of these nations who have Idols in their homes I've been to India nine times and you go and you see these Idols in the home people that are supposed to be Believers but they still have a statue here or they have something you know over here a picture of some sort every restaurant that you go into the elevators and during the holidays they're burning incense and it about choke you if you try to take an elevator because they're burning this incense to their God because they want something that they can see but everything that they have that they see is something that's man-made that's how we get Idols in our life because we be become disillusioned discouraged whatever word you want to use because we can't see and we want to see and Paul recognizes that this is what's going on with these people they needed something that they could see and and he begins to preach to them and he recognizes that uh these people serve other gods and while they're serving other God Gods it doesn't mean that they won't sit around and talk about something new brother Daniel ever met preachers like that always something new always looking for something new and that's the way these people were and so Paul he stands up on Mars Hill and he starts preaching to him and he says I perceive that you're too superstitious bunch of religious nuts yeah that don't have a clue what you're talking about you've got an inscription up here on the rock that says to the unknown God and you don't even know what you're worshiping because men have come along and they have given you a form of godliness but they've denied the power thereof it's really what Paul was preaching to them you've got this inscription up here and you don't even know what you're worshiping and and because you can't see this unknown God you decided to take matters into your own hands and you get a candle here and you get a statue here and you get another thing over here and it becomes idol worship because you want something that you can see see see see see now I find it very interesting that Paul did not tell these people that their unknown God was an idol he said you've got this inscription up here and you're worshiping ignorantly come on you're ignorant about who the unknown God is and you have by your own imaginations taken your hands and you have taken some gold you've taken silver you've taken some candles you've taken some Stone you've taken this product or that product and you've set it up there and you worshiped it and and you're just ignorantly worshiping but Paul came to tell the people I want you to know it's all in ignorance what you're doing you have not a clue but I am coming to tell you that that unknown God is the god that made all things he made the world and I realize you can't see him you're not going to worship Him by making an idol you're not going to worship Him by anything that you can make with your own hands you're not even going to be able to uh uh come up with an idea to make you think that you know what you're doing but it's going to take a revelation of the spirit of God in your lives and so Paul is just expounding to them that this one that they have so ignorantly worshiped right through the years is the very same one who had walked the Earth just a few years prior Jesus Christ now see the people because that they had conjured up an idea in their mind as to what this uh unknown God was they made no connection between the Lord Jesus Christ walking on the earth and their unknown God they made no connection there because to them Jesus was just another man he was just another individual walking around on the earth and and the people there were some people who were responding to him now see when Jesus was walking on the earth there were people that had all sorts of opinions about him some say that he's a prophet [Music] right now those that were saying some say he's a prophet did they receive the prophet's message you know it's it's the same thing that we say today they say so and so and so and so so and I always ask who is they who is they some say that he's a prophet who is some and are these some believe that he's a prophet or are they just repeating what somebody else said and we get in the same boat this is how rumors get started as well because one says one thing and the next one repeats it with a little twist to it and somebody else repeats it with a Different Twist to it and by the time that it gets back to the original voice it's nothing like the original voice that is why we always have to take anything that anybody says preachers included back to the word it has to lay in the pages of the word because we don't want to be those that say some say he's a prophet some say he's the Apostle some say he's John the Baptist some say he's Elias but who do you say who do you say who do you say say he is well we know the response that Peter gave him but remember when they originally gave Jesus the answer they were listening to all of the voices about what people were saying and that continued through Jesus's life Jesus there there were still people that say you know this Jesus he's up there he's got a big cow out and you know they tell me he fed 5,000 with just a little bit of food well reckon who he is well you know some are saying that he's Elijah returned yeah I heard that he last week he fed 4,000 people and you know this is just really strange this this seems to be God but I wonder who he is well they tell me that he came from Nazareth and his mother's name is Mary and his father's name was Joseph and he worked in the carpenter shop a while and then he decided to do this itinerate preaching see all of these voices but eventually it comes down to that Jesus is asking you as an individual as he did Peter who do you say now we can take all of these instances where we watched him feed the 5,000 we watched him feed the 4,000 we watched him do uh Miracles uh and we watched the the wine the water be turned to wine at canaa of Galilee and we watched all of these Miracles and we can spout off all of those Miracles and still wonder in our mind who is he but there comes a time where that we have to make a decision who is he and when the revelation of Jesus Christ comes into our life where we can say this is none other than the Lord Jesus Christ God come down in the flesh the fullness of the godhead bodily was in him and when he was finished on the earth he went back to the father and he said I'm going to send you another comforter and he PR sent the promise of the Holy Ghost and we saw the Fulfillment of the Holy Ghost coming to the Believers on the day day of Pentecost then we have to say with a heart uh Lord I believe that when you were on the earth in you was the very Spirit of the Living God who created heaven and earth and when you were done on the earth you were done with that body you went back to the original place and you sent your spirit and divided it among the Believers so that we could have that very same Spirit do you know that the spirit of God when he gives you the Holy Ghost is not just so that you can speak in tongues on although that's part of it it's not just so you can shout that's part of it but when he gives you his spirit it's so that you can identify the word when the word comes and is preached into your life there's something inside of you it's the word agreeing with the word it's the life of Jesus Christ that is agreeing with that very word that he was demonstrating while he was here on the earth in the form of Jesus Christ in that body that that he was living in now all of these all of these Jewish people that were around Paul they didn't like him preaching that so they s send him to Athens now he's dealing with a bunch of heathens and when he tells he tells these heathens I mean I'm I'm not being trying to make them of nothingness because that's not what Paul preached to them right Paul began to preach to them I am a Jew but I am here to tell you that this inscription that you've got up here on the rock that says to the unknown God I am here to tell you that you are ignorantly worshiping him and I I don't know that the scripture gives in complete detail all that Paul said so I'm going to add lib a little bit here all right so Paul he's saying you know this this rock up here actually Paul was right there on the Rock preaching to them can you imagine this guy Jewish but had had an experience with the Lord Jesus Christ and now he has been told you know it's not safe here at Jason's house why don't you go on ahead of us to Athens we'll we'll come and we'll come and get up with you a little later but why don't you go to Athens and and maybe you can just settle down a little a little bit and you can have a little rest and and and we'll yeah lay low we'll we'll we'll come after a while and uh you know there's too many spirits stirred up here and and so you know you need to get out of town Paul and so they sent him on I don't think Paul really wanted to go but they sent him on to Athens and when Paul got to Athens he realizes that he's right in the middle of of such a den of vipers idolators people that are reaching into demonic to try to pull something out but all the while on this rock they have this inscription to the unknown God ignorantly worshiping the Bible says they were ignorantly worshiping now I am not going to get into uh how what do they call it the semantics of it maybe uh I'm not going to get into that but here Paul is standing on this rock and he's talking to these people that have all of these Idols now I don't know exactly because I figure by the time that Paul got there that they did not just have a relic sitting in their home or sitting at the altar of the unknown God but they probably by that time had figured out a ring or a necklace or a bracelet or something with the inscription uh of their imagination to this unknown God they were trying to carry this God with them wherever they went because everybody is looking for something to worship so Paul is standing here on this rock and he says you're ignorantly worshiping but I want to tell you that what you're worship the way you're worshiping is not the correct way to worship because God is not this unknown God that you're trying to worship is not something that can be made by hands or seen with your eyes it is something that he is he is one who has walked on the earth and now he's gone back to this place he resurrected and this same God has taken all peoples and put them under one blood no longer is there a separation between Jew and Gentile see on one hand he's dealing with the Jewish people who for so long have tried to bring the correct offering year after year after year to stay in fellowship with God and and most likely because that the Pharisees wanted to keep the people under their thumb they wanted to keep the the the tithe and offering coming into the into the uh into the temple uh they kept them under their thumb and so they would tell them you need to do this and you need to do this and you need to do this and it was outside of the Scripture it was outside of what God had mandated in the Old Testament but yet these Pharisees as they're sitting together and they're constantly talking day after day after day and writings and talking and writings and and they're the you know they're just always taking notes and and coming up with ideas because they're men and after a while they create these fences that are pushing the people further and further and further away from God and so then Jesus comes along and all of these people who were living under fear of the preachers of the Pharisees now Jesus comes along with a message that looks so much more inviting than what they have done through the years and people begin to come to him and it causes these leaders to become angry upset obsessed with killing the same ones this you know you start thinking about what the people have uh uh have gone through and they've been told all of their life Thou shalt not murder so now how do these Pharisees get around the fact that they want to murder people now we're not talking about the Gentiles we're talking about their own Jewish blood uh murder when they have a commandment Thou shalt not murder but the preachers are telling us this is a sect of religion that we've got to abolish we've got to do away with it we can't let it get out of hand we're going to lose our control over the people and so they're you know they're sending people out to do murder uh of these Believers in in Jesus Christ and after a while how do you how do you take care of that situation because really what they're doing is they're now they're giving a gospel to the people that is not what was intended from the start so we have to call it another gospel right and the people now have to make a substitution because they're only taking the word of the Pharisees that's right they're taking the word of the preachers they're taking the word of those that study the law but now Jesus Christ The Living Word has stepped among them and he starts defying their teachings thou sayest that's right and he lays out but I say unto you if a man looks upon a woman to lust after her he has committed adultery already with her in his heart you know the law said don't commit adultery but Jesus comes along and he sees the way that the preachers have Twisted the word the way that they have manipulated the word to to uh help themselves right to try to cover up their own sin right and but all the while trying to keep their thumb on the people because they don't want to lose the their big church and so then Jesus comes along and he he preaches a freeing gospel to the people right the Pharisees say don't commit adultery but I'm telling you that if a man looks upon a woman to lust after he's committed adultery with her already in his heart and the people say now wait a minute I saw preacher so and so yeah I saw him the other day with a woman that wasn't his wife and he was looking at her kind of googly eyed and now Jesus is here telling us that just to look with lust we've committed adultery even though there really wasn't even an act but Jesus is laying out a diff and it starts freeing people now you might say how would that free people because people want truth they want truth they want to know exactly where they stand with God they don't really want it sugarcoated unless they want to hide but a real true believer that wants their heart right with the Living God they wanted Gun Barrel straight they want the word with power and authority and straightness until that they can get their life out because what the people really want is what these people in Athens wanted and they didn't know how to get to it they wanted a relationship with a God that they knew nothing about and so here is Paul coming and saying that as Peter did on the day of Pentecost this same Jesus whom you crucified has become both Lord and Christ both Lord and Messiah and Paul is preaching to these Believers this Jesus has come from the the Realms of Glory stepped into a human body and by the sacrifice of his own body has made of one blood All Nations so that these men could dwell on the earth and that it was a time determined before it was appointed and he's given the bounds of the habitation and Jesus or Paul is telling these people that they could reach out and they could find him now seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you all the while that that invitation is being given there's something on the inside that God has placed there that is reaching out for it what do you mean preacher well here's what I mean there are are people who can go into church or they can sit under the sound of a gospel message and they can never respond just no response whatsoever and then there are others that are just crying their eyes out there's something going on inside of them they're recognizing that Jesus is close and that he has come to help them and that they are going to respond to him now how can this be the scripture tells us that no man can come to Jesus except the father draws them there has to be a drawing from that other dimension before a man can ever respond now I wouldn't even begin to understand this except to know that God is Sovereign and that he has a timing for everything that is why we don't dismiss people that are out on the bar stools people that are uh out in sin people that uh even people that call themselves Believers and all they do is sit at home I know there are some people who can't get out Church they're just not physically able and there are other people that are too lazy and there are other people that have been hurt they keep all their standard but they're hurt and so they sit at home there are others who say church is a bunch of Hypocrites and so the hypocrit stands between them and God as brother Shelly says but there are all manner of people but when God gets ready when it's time God can come in the right season and he can lay his hand on some somebody and everybody else don't look like they're getting a thing but that one individual because it's their time because it's their time God comes with a sovereign move I ain't saying you have to cry I ain't saying you got to shout speaking to I ain't saying that all I know is that God comes at a sovereign moment and he grips the heart of somebody and he says today is the day you may understand it something may have already been happening at home and you just said I got to go find somebody to preach to me I got to find something to to try to satisfy this that's going on in me and it may be that somebody got drug into the house of the Lord and all of the sudden God says it's time no no uh no idea that it was going to happen God just says it's time and happens right here are all these Heathen people there and Paul's preaching to them and he's trying to tell them you've got this God up here there this rock I think it's just beautiful the way that God puts things together because the rock that followed them in the wilderness and then when Peter was asked who do men say that I am and he says Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus says Upon This Rock I'll build my church The Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it so now we got Paul standing on a rock again with an inscription that says to the unknown God it wasn't a man made Dirt Pile it was a rock it's still there you can go visit it yes Upon This Rock now it wasn't this rock in areopagus or Mars Hill but Paul standing on this rock preaching to them explaining to them that this Jesus Christ came to the Earth was crucified and he was resurrected now that stirred them up the resurrection stirred them up but before he got to the resurrection he starts talking to him and he says you know there was a season of time when God winked at the ignorance and I believe that there are seasons of our life where God does the same thing for us he Winks at our ignorance now we may with our natural ear have heard something preached that was in the scripture but it wasn't our time yet and God allowed the ignorance to go on but then there came a time when God let our eyes be open and the time for ignorance was pass I want to tell you there are people that run right over top of it and continue in their ignorance but it's not really ignorance it's blatant Disobedience can anybody remember the exact quote that Bobby Connor used to give halfhearted obedience is just cloaked Rebellion I believe was what he said and I've thought on this statement many times half-hearted obedience is only veiled or cloaked Rebellion Because unless we fully obey we're walking in Rebellion amen amen if something is made known to us and we continue to walk in our Rebellion or even a half obedience come on now remember he's looking for the meat of obedience Jesus is looking for our obedience to him and he doesn't want half-hearted obedience he wants complete obedience and we're working toward it now remember that that we can only repent for what we can see there are things that are still inside of us that we cannot repent for because we can't see them yet but as God reveals things to us and he he he brings it across through the preaching of the word or in our own private prayer time he is looking for obedience and he's looking for repentance from us and if we see it and we turn our head or if we decide we're going to go halfway with it right then we're still walking in Rebellion I just be honest with you there are things through the years that we don't like we saw it God dealt with us and we didn't like it but we still had the choice am I going to walk in obedience am I going to walk in truth or am I am I going to walk in my Rebellion but see we don't like to look at it like we're rebelling we always like to look at it as we're the exception to the rule and so I'll just you know that wasn't for me listen we've all done it we've all shoveled it to the guy behind us we heard something preached and we said oh we had a name attached to it in fact it was inscribed on our shovel when really God was speaking directly to us not always but God don't need our help with the shovel he doesn't need our help with the shovel God knows how to speak to people he knows how to get their attention he knows how to call their number and he knows how to put his finger on them when they are walking in Rebellion whether it be one quarter 1/ half three4 or all the way he knows how to put his finger on anybody testify today that God's done that to you for you he's put his finger on that rebellion and he kept working on it until that you said okay Lord I'm willing to give all the way and that's what we got to do as Believers because the time of ignorance has passed amen there are some things that you'll get by with today that you won't get by with tomorrow or next week the time of ignorance will be passed and God will require it fully of you and you'll wonder why that things are going wrong in your life and then you start questioning the Lord and he opens your your eyes to your own Rebellion friends that's not a pretty sight it is not a pretty sight when God opens your eyes to your own Rebellion to your own uglies and he just starts putting them right in your face with a mirror and he says it's time to get rid of this it's time to get rid of it it's time for you to come all the way with me and lay aside all of the doubt all of the unbelief all of your hurts all of your anxieties all of your fortunes just lay them aside and say Lord I'm coming and I'm allowing you to help me Amen to walk in full obedience will it happen again very possible because God is continually dealing with us continuing every day to deal with us because the object friend of a Believer yes the object of a Believer is to become 100% yielded to the Holy Spirit and as we come closer and closer to the coming of the Lord and we're laying off more of us more of us remember John said I must decrease so he can increase that ought to be a statement that we're constantly saying about our own selves I've got to decrease there has got to be less of me and more of him because when there's less of me and I'm depending more and more more on the spirit of God that dwells in me then I am getting myself more and more ready for a translation these temporary raptures that we have like we had this morning as we were in worship and there was a high praise would go out these are temporary raptures and then we come back down but we don't ever want to come back down to where we started we go up and we come back down but we're high but we're higher yes sir then God can speak to us on that level and we get in the next time and we press in and we praise and we let God deal with our heart and we Rapture again to maybe a higher level and then we come back down but by God's grace never to that level that we started out at because the spirit of God is taking us higher and higher this is where we we talk about uh we're going to speed up and they're going to slow down and we're going to meet in the middle the molecules of our body we're taking on another dimension in the spirit because this Earth is not going to hold us so we become more and more yielded to the Holy Spirit allowing him to be fully in us because we can do nothing of ourself because if if we try to do it of ourself that's what we we get self that's exactly we end up with self John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and that life was the light of men so Paul when he preached to these people he was telling them the time of their ignorance was passed the unknown God that they had all these Idols to and they had this inscription he tells them that this God this God that they could not see that they ignorantly worshiped they didn't know nothing about in him we live and move and have our being this is the same God that created us so we have our being but in him is life we live and John 1 says in him was life and that life was the light of man the life of Jesus Christ in The Believer is the light that is needed for man so in order to have life you have to be in him here's a scripture that is so misunderstood was surely misunderstood by the disciples John 6:56 he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him sitting around the table trying to partake of the Passover all of the sudden Jesus says unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you or what kind of cannibalism is this going to have to gnaw on one another no Jesus wanted us to have spirit and word spirit and life he in order for us to uh operate in in a place where that we are fully uh demonstrating his life we have to partake of his spirit and his life or his word the word has to become so real inside of us Ephesians 1:4 as the musicians are coming according as he have chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love see you can't you can't live this in and of yourself you have to be in in him the the Bible tells us when Peter be to uh speak to them on the day of Pentecost he he wanted them to recognize that there had been something that had happened to them on the day of Pentecost they couldn't recognize it they couldn't see it they didn't understand it right they just thought this was a bunch of men that had had too much wine and come out into the streets they'd been drinking all day and all night and on into the morning and come out in the streets and there are a bunch of drunk men and Peter had to say no these aren't drunk as you suppose but this is that what which was spoken of by Joel The Prophet saying that in the last days and see we have the we have the blessing that God would come in the last day the last of the last days and that he would pour out his Spirit on the believer so that we could have this s same indwelling of the Holy Spirit spirit and he gave the he gave the formula he gave the prescription for it and he said repent repent now if you would be hearing me today and you say all of these people have already repented let me just tell you set your mind at ease I've been serving the lord for 35 years and I find myself repenting every day well didn't you repent 35 years ago when you accepted Jesus as your savior yeah I did remember I said a while ago I repented for what I could see but as the days go by and God reveals himself to us and he starts putting his finger on things in our life I can carry it if I want to as you can that's why people get grouchy as a bear because they carry their sin around and they don't repent and all God is looking for for you to have peace is for you to repent that's it to repent and follow him with a pure heart and when we follow him with a pure heart repentance is not it's not a it's not a job it's not a it's not difficult it's not drudgery to us it's drudgery to us when we carry that thing for way too long and then we become irritable and grouchy and everybody wonders what's the matter with us why are we in such a uh you know just such a state of mind that we are it's because we're carrying things that God has revealed to us uh that are that are sin that are besetting us that are unbelief and we've decided that we're going to carry it for a few more days right and God dealing with us every day about it and we just continue to carry it around and then all of a sudden somebody says to us you are grouchy because God is dealing with you and you just need to let go of whatever you're carrying or sometimes we just recognize I'm tired of this anybody ever said Lord I [Laughter] give I'm done I don't want this attitude that I carry I don't want this grouchy nature that I have I don't want to be irritable with my wife I don't want to be angry at my children but because I've been carrying this around for days and weeks I I just have been just a a grouchy old fell and I don't want to be that way anymore you give it to God and it doesn't take months and years to get over it if we give it to God he can cleanse it it's done and he can restore unto us the joy Joy of his salvation he doesn't take our Salvation away but our joy has diminished but if we'll repent and say Lord I give but when you're a new believer it takes repentance asking the Lord to cleanse you by the blood of Jesus Christ it's not the blood of a Preacher it's not even the laying of hands on a preacher by a preacher or another believer it's just you saying Lord I need the blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse me from all unrighteousness and fill me with your spirit be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins recognizing that God has done something for you and so you enter into baptism and and you allow all of that old to be buried it doesn't the water doesn't wash away the sin right you better make sure all of the sin has been cleansed out of your life that you know about before you ever go to the water and the water is just an identification that I died I died it's no longer I that liveth but it's Christ in me and then there's the promise the Blessed promise of the Holy Ghost to come to those that were willing to obey would just stand with us today in him we live and move and have our being we're not serving a God that cannot be contacted we're not serving a god that is 10 million miles away but neither do we have to have some kind of idolatry but he chose to live all inside to live inside of us to guide us day by day we don't have to be ignorant we can walk with an assurance to know that Jesus Christ is alive and he's well right here today and if you don't know him you can if you have sin in your life today is the day you can be rid of it you don't have to carry it another day we do I come to The Garden Alone while the Dee is still on the Roses I come to The Garden Alone while the Dew is still on the rose and the voice I hear falling on my ear the Son of God [Music] discloses and He Walks With Me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his [Music] own and the joy we share as we [Music] te there not other has ever known he speaks and the sound of his [Music] voice is so sweet the birds hush their s in and the [Music] me that he gave to with my heart is [Music] ringing and he was with me and he talks oh and he tells me I am is oh and the [Music] joy we [Music] share none other has ever known and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own and the joy we share as we te there none other has ever [Music] known this may seem like it was an Evangelistic kind of a message and that's way God is speaking right now we're going to let him do exactly that we don't know what God is doing in all of his ways but we know God is moving he's moving things are shifting things are moving and as God sends different people in among us we want to be able to minister to them and we don't want any of our stuff to be transferred to them any of our yucky stuff we don't want it transferred to them we want the Holy Spirit to be so alive in [Music] us sister April sent me this quote that I was trying to find a few minutes ago Bobby Connor and I'm going to give it to you the Lord the this is Bobby Connor speaking the Lord said to me when it comes to seeking me I detest multitasking he said halfhearted obedience is nothing but cloaked Rebellion amen now this is still true today God detests multitask and he wants our attention yes he does and he doesn't want half-hearted obedience no he does he wants full complete obedience from us he doesn't want us dabbling here or dabbling there he doesn't want us having a an idolatrous piece in front of us something that keeps pulling us back to it but he wants complete and total surrender so that as God adds to to us we're not transferring our idolatry on someone else we're not transferring our Rebellion on somebody else but we are able by the power of the Living God as I heard brother Bram preach on Wednesday night that there is something the Holy Ghost is so full in us that we impart to them eternal life you can't impart what you don't possess amen and we want to be able to impart to those that come in so let's ask the Lord just to completely everything that we may have been holding on to One More Time Lord we stand together around the front of this building Lord there are some sitting back in the seats standing in the seats Lord I don't know where they are but I know God that you are are the same yesterday and today and forever and I know that you are calling us to a higher place you want us to be fully cleansed of all unrighteousness you are not going to allow us to continue to walk in ignorance and you're not going to allow us to continue to walk in our cloaked Rebellion you are calling us Lord to be fully dedicated to you and so God if we stand here with something that is between us and you Lord you are able to put your finger on it once again today last week we may not have had the intestinal fortitude to say you can have it Lord but maybe you've dealt with us through this week and this week we can say Okay Lord you can have it would you give us the grace not to pick it back up yes Lord there are those that have idolized their hurts they didn't mean to but it was what they came to look at every day just what they looked at they kept their eyes on it but God by the power of the Holy Ghost come even this moment and give us the grace to put that Idol out of our life that it is not what we live for tomorrow it's not what keeps us going but the word and the spirit is what keeps us going in him the Lord Jesus Christ we have life and we have it more abundantly Lord I pray this over all of us here and those that are watching this service and he walks with me and he talks walks with me and he tells me I am his [Music] own and the joy we [Music] share none other has [Music] ever known he speaks and the sound of his [Laughter] voice is so sweet that the birds touch their singing and the MEO that he gave to me within my heart is [Music] ringing and he walks with me and he [Music] talks [Music] am joy we share as we tell father has ever [Music] known I'm free from the fear of [Music] tomorrow just Worship the Lord another minute or two our time in his his presence is not wasted it's in this atmosphere where
