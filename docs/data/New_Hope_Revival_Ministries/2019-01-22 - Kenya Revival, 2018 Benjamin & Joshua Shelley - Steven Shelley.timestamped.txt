[0:14] [Music]
[0:25] hey I'm Benjamin shell and I'm Joshua
[0:27] shell and today we'd like to take you on
[0:29] our journey we just got back from Kenya
[0:31] Africa with our dad and uh so we're
[0:33] going to tell you some different things
[0:35] that happened along the way some things
[0:37] we saw the Lord do some friends that we
[0:39] made and I hope you enjoy
[0:42] [Music]
[0:47] this when we first get there you know
[0:50] Dad's CD's playing right in the car his
[0:53] singing
[0:54] CD you know you get to Convention and
[0:56] you hear oh well I was in your dad's
[0:58] meetings you know when he was here
[1:00] you know 2000 or even earlier than that
[1:03] and you know you would think going there
[1:05] after 18 years all that would have had
[1:07] kind of dwindled away you know people
[1:09] would have started to forget what had
[1:11] happened in the meetings then and it
[1:13] definitely it crossed my mind like you
[1:16] know maybe you know are they even going
[1:17] to remember much about it like yeah but
[1:19] they do they remembered everything there
[1:21] was boys that were 2 years old that
[1:23] remember the service when the pillar of
[1:25] fire came in the room I mean they just
[1:26] they remember that stuff and of course I
[1:29] mean that's that's something that would
[1:30] obviously stand out but you know 2 years
[1:32] old you know You' think you'd have just
[1:34] forgot it hearing more
[1:37] about Dad's Ministry there before I was
[1:41] even around um made me made something
[1:44] click and realized that we had to go um
[1:48] and so I think hearing what had happened
[1:51] things that had happened before I was
[1:53] even around made me realize we we have
[1:57] to go and do this I mean I told Dad like
[1:59] I I don't want to go I I just didn't
[2:01] want to go at that point and I just
[2:03] really prayed that night and at overall
[2:07] I just really felt like I needed to go I
[2:09] may not have wanted to really but I
[2:11] needed to before I left I was pretty low
[2:13] and I you know we all go through those
[2:15] ruts you're just low I go over there and
[2:18] me being a worship leader here um to see
[2:22] the worship to see the sincere worship
[2:26] that they have and to see
[2:30] them worship and not care what anyone
[2:32] else around them thinks just to worship
[2:36] and it be from them straight to him and
[2:39] and there was there was nothing like
[2:41] nothing for show it was all so so
[2:44] sincere and I think maybe the Lord
[2:46] wanted me to go over there to see that
[2:48] to' be like there's people still that
[2:50] worship with a sincere and pure heart
[2:52] that have no motives they just want to
[2:54] worship Him
[3:00] set your heart and daning you set your
[3:03] heart daning set your
[3:07] [Music]
[3:09] [Applause]
[3:11] heart I think for me really it was just
[3:14] to to get away from different things in
[3:17] my life and just to really like focus on
[3:19] him a lot and be able to just take
[3:22] oneon-one time with him and it made me
[3:25] want to come back and to serve him more
[3:28] and to um
[3:30] really just you know worship with my
[3:33] whole heart you know I I'll raise my
[3:34] hands and clap or whatever but it made
[3:36] me check myself to see you know was I
[3:39] really worshiping with my whole heart
[3:41] and um so coming back I definitely just
[3:44] wanted to give it my all and you know
[3:47] Praise Him to the fullest and honor him
[3:49] to the fullest first church service was
[3:51] on Friday night and uh we get out of the
[3:54] car and they're singing one of dad's
[3:56] songs but that was after we were stuck
[3:58] in traffic for for 2 hours
[4:00] 2 hours and then we get there we open
[4:03] the car there's we didn't it was a old
[4:05] school building that they were using for
[4:07] a church it was outside though and um so
[4:10] we walk in and there was probably 300
[4:14] people yeah something like that
[4:15] something like that and um they were
[4:18] worshiping and it it's amazing it's
[4:21] beautiful to see them worship to be
[4:22] honest with you it's just it's beautiful
[4:24] and then uh dad preached that night and
[4:27] you want to talk about entering into the
[4:29] the word and amening the word and you
[4:33] know letting your amen be heard they
[4:36] they do that to the fullest extent the
[4:39] lady came up in a uh plastic chair they
[4:42] she could barely could walk cuz of her
[4:44] knees and they brought a plastic chair
[4:46] up so she could sit down and um that was
[4:49] in the morning service well that
[4:51] afternoon or evening I can't remember
[4:53] which one it was but she came up on the
[4:56] platform and testified and she was fine
[4:58] like walking running around like
[5:00] perfectly fine and just that morning she
[5:02] couldn't she barely could walk like she
[5:04] was literally would was came to stand at
[5:07] the altar and they had to bring a chair
[5:08] cuz she just couldn't move and then that
[5:10] night or whatever she was able just to
[5:12] walk up on the platform and give her
[5:13] testimony out and there was one I I
[5:17] believe it was the first um Sunday night
[5:20] of the convention uh dad was preaching
[5:22] and he got towards the end and he said
[5:24] um something to something like um the
[5:28] spirit of cancer he called the per of
[5:30] cancer out and I know for sure there was
[5:32] at least more than 10 people that said
[5:34] they were healed of cancer that
[5:49] night you trespassing
[5:52] Spirit
[5:56] you take your dirty hands off the
[5:59] children of God
[6:05] but the pastor guere got a call and a
[6:08] lady got filled with the Holy Ghost
[6:10] while dad while Dad was preaching one of
[6:11] the services in Nairobi if I if I'm and
[6:14] not even a hand was laid on her yeah
[6:16] nothing just dad was talking about you
[6:17] know you don't need to be you don't have
[6:19] I don't have to pray for you you can
[6:21] receive it right where you are right now
[6:23] and that day she went home and just sat
[6:26] laid in her bed and just prayed and
[6:28] cried out to the Lord until the Lord
[6:29] came down and like she knew she was full
[6:31] of the Holy
[6:32] Ghost I receive my
[6:35] Deliverance receive the baptism of the
[6:38] Holy Ghost and
[6:39] Fire receive him right
[6:45] now receive the Holy
[6:49] [Applause]
[6:51] Ghost Pastor Peterson Guero is over
[6:54] three churches in different parts of
[6:56] Kenya we preached at all three of his
[6:58] churches
[7:00] his sons that we were with the most
[7:02] would be Anthony and
[7:05] mangi oh they're they're awesome by the
[7:07] end of it they were you know their
[7:08] family like the boys in their culture if
[7:12] you're in like their dad's age group
[7:15] whatever you call him dad anyways and so
[7:17] the twin boys were calling Dad Dad and
[7:22] um just just dad said he never
[7:25] experienced anything like this in Africa
[7:27] just like um they would just come over
[7:30] to the house they had rented for us and
[7:33] just sat in fellowship with us for hours
[7:35] and hours until late into the night and
[7:37] he said it helped him so much cuz it
[7:39] felt more like a family it felt more
[7:41] like you know fellowship and stuff like
[7:44] that this guy comes up to me and Taps me
[7:47] on the shoulder and he's like my son
[7:49] wants a picture with the I think it's
[7:50] pronounced Zoom I'm not 100% sure but um
[7:54] and I was like excuse me and I thought
[7:57] he was saying asking to take a picture
[7:59] with his family like a picture of the
[8:01] family and I was like I'm not sure what
[8:04] you're saying so I was like mangi and so
[8:06] he told me and he wanted his son wanted
[8:08] a picture with the white man and if I'm
[8:10] pronouncing this right I think it's Zoom
[8:12] means white man and so I got a picture
[8:15] with somebody I have no idea who he was
[8:17] but he want his son wanted a picture
[8:19] with the white man we first when we
[8:21] first landed we were in a um we're in
[8:23] Nairobi which is a city and it's not a
[8:26] huge City but there's 4 million people
[8:28] in the city so it's it's slammed so by
[8:32] the time we spent I believe around a
[8:34] week in Nairobi so when we went to Nuru
[8:37] where it's more of Countryside it was we
[8:40] were very happy because it was and
[8:42] driving there was fun cuz you know you
[8:44] got to see different Villages you got to
[8:45] see uh the the Great Rift Valley that
[8:48] was neat like I love Nuru better than I
[8:51] do nirobi just because it's not as slam
[8:54] it's not and of course you know seeing
[8:56] all the animals and stuff is pretty
[8:58] amazing like you can go see him in the
[9:00] zoo and be like oh that's really cool
[9:02] but it's nothing like going out into the
[9:04] wild and you know seeing the animals in
[9:08] their natural habitat they told us
[9:10] before going into the convention um you
[9:13] know you're going to be tired and you
[9:15] know I thought to myself yeah okay you
[9:17] know we'll be tired but you know we'll
[9:18] be fine right most of the people were
[9:20] getting up at 4: to 4:30 the first
[9:23] worship and prayer started at 5: so they
[9:26] were up from you know 4: maybe even
[9:30] earlier and most of these people aren't
[9:31] going to sleep until 12 12:30 until
[9:34] whenever they would go to sleep so
[9:35] they're getting very minimal rest and
[9:37] not only that they're sleeping on
[9:38] mattresses that are like this thin on
[9:41] pavement um on concrete floors you know
[9:44] and hot it's hot not they don't have
[9:46] fans like we would here and uh you know
[9:50] people weren't complaining they were
[9:52] they were so they had so much
[9:54] anticipation um that they didn't care I
[9:56] never heard one person complain like at
[9:58] all the whole time yeah they they didn't
[10:00] care they were so grateful to be there
[10:02] right they have such freedom and I I
[10:05] find in traveling with that that a lot
[10:10] of the Bride in America is so so bound
[10:15] so they're they feel it feels like
[10:18] they're in such captivity um you know
[10:20] they go to church and they stand there
[10:22] like a statue instead of the word is
[10:25] alive and if the word's alive the people
[10:28] should be alive
[10:29] and not dead and so going over there and
[10:33] seeing how alive the people are makes
[10:36] you want to be more alive makes you want
[10:38] to worship more makes you want to press
[10:40] in more they're fighting this really the
[10:41] same battles that we are and um just
[10:44] because you know they have so much
[10:46] freedom in their worship and stuff we
[10:48] can have that here we can have that here
[10:51] but like he said a lot of churches are
[10:54] just bound up and we just need to let go
[10:58] and you know break our chains off and
[11:00] just to be free one of like some you
[11:03] know stuff that really sticks out to me
[11:05] is um the kids to see how the just the
[11:08] little kids worship and how they are you
[11:11] know just love I I love being around
[11:13] them like you know when we went to their
[11:15] Sunday school and stuff and handed out
[11:17] candy and sang with them and that was
[11:19] like that was so much fun to me because
[11:21] uh I made friends over the week of these
[11:24] little boys and little girls that you
[11:25] know would come up to me every time they
[11:27] saw me and just like hey what's up you
[11:29] know
[11:30] and um it was really nice because most
[11:32] the kids there um all speak English
[11:35] unless they're really really little so
[11:37] it was really nice just to be able to
[11:39] talk to you know you could talk to them
[11:40] and can communicate with them you know
[11:42] there wasn't that language barrier
[11:44] that's there in most cases and so we
[11:47] were able to get really close to a bunch
[11:49] of the kids and just really just have a
[11:52] relationship and a bond with them well
[11:54] in talking about the kids worshiping I
[11:57] noticed um you know if you look at when
[12:01] when when someone's praying in America
[12:02] and you look at the little kids no
[12:04] matter what the age are their eyes are
[12:06] probably open looking around the room
[12:07] you know good 90% of the time right it's
[12:11] not that way in Africa you you look out
[12:13] over the congregation while a prayers is
[12:15] going forth the kids are on their knees
[12:16] the kids are either on their knees are
[12:18] both hands are in the air and most of
[12:20] the time they're crying and praying not
[12:22] praying quietly under their breath
[12:24] praying loudly like and that was pretty
[12:26] amazing to see one of the churches in
[12:28] Nuru they actually have two benches um
[12:31] like the pull pit would be here the
[12:33] benches are like right here on the side
[12:35] where all the little kids sit like
[12:37] probably 2 to six or something like that
[12:39] maybe even younger and when Dad would D
[12:42] dad started praying really hard they all
[12:44] turned around and got on their knees and
[12:46] would just and they none of them moved
[12:47] until Dad was done praying they didn't
[12:49] get up they didn't look around they
[12:51] stayed in that position and prayed and
[12:53] you could hear them praying it wasn't
[12:54] just for show you could hear them
[12:56] praying so the clip you're about to see
[12:58] is pretty neat
[12:59] uh dad had just got up to the platform
[13:02] it was an afternoon session um he hadn't
[13:04] even really even started preaching yet
[13:07] and I don't even remember what exactly
[13:09] he said but he said power and when he
[13:11] said power every light in the building
[13:13] shut off all the microphone stopped
[13:15] working there was no electricity at all
[13:19] and so here Dad goes he just rolls with
[13:22] it and starts singing oh Lord send the
[13:24] power just now and I'm telling you what
[13:26] those people started singing and it was
[13:28] so so fun it was probably one of the
[13:31] most fun things that even happened I was
[13:33] like it was just fun like I would have
[13:35] been fine with the power just staying
[13:36] out like yeah because because people
[13:38] were like we don't care no power it's
[13:41] fine like they they were just going to
[13:43] keep going and so that was really fun
[13:46] [Music]
[14:01] dad got done preaching and just started
[14:03] singing press on like he had done in a
[14:05] couple other services
[14:07] and uh started walking up and you know
[14:10] up the aisles you know shaking
[14:13] everybody's hand press on press on and
[14:15] just something really moved and as he
[14:17] started walking all the way to the back
[14:19] just shaking as many hands as he could
[14:21] and yelling out to the People Press on
[14:23] um something really just the anointing
[14:26] really fell and I looked back I was able
[14:28] to look back back and saw Benjamin and
[14:30] Dad just was weeping and um of course
[14:33] you know it made me just start crying
[14:35] and you know just to see Dad you know
[14:38] Dad gave it his all like you know he he
[14:41] really was 100% like you know he meant
[14:46] [Music]
[14:51] it Hallelujah
[14:56] Jesus I love you thank you for with me
[15:01] we can go all the
[15:02] way can go all the way we can make much
[15:06] further now
[15:09] Hallelujah I have always Dad has always
[15:11] told me about the services where people
[15:14] were being carried out the window and
[15:16] stuff like that and I had never seen it
[15:18] you know I believed it but never saw it
[15:20] but in that service I literally saw them
[15:23] there were so many people falling out
[15:24] they were picking them up and carrying
[15:26] you know filing them out the door to lay
[15:28] on the grass cuz
[15:29] the the anointing was just so strong it
[15:32] was hard to leave the anointing like
[15:34] that like it was hard just to you know
[15:37] just just to leave you you didn't want
[15:39] to leave morning we left I I was crying
[15:42] like a baby because just you know after
[15:45] 16 days of being with these people every
[15:47] day yeah every day they're more like
[15:49] family than they would be friends and so
[15:52] knowing that you know I may not see them
[15:54] for you know another year Lord willing
[15:56] if we go back you know um you know that
[16:00] that's that's
[16:03] hard go through your life and see what
[16:07] is really important and what you need to
[16:09] clean out because you know the only way
[16:12] we going to get closer to him is if you
[16:13] make more room for him and he's doing
[16:15] his part but you got to look sometimes
[16:18] and see if you're doing yours and clean
[16:20] out all the junk and um stuff that's
[16:22] gone bad in your life Freedom will come
[16:25] when when people come together and
[16:28] decide hey when they come into church
[16:30] and decide we're going to be free we're
[16:32] we're not going to be bound anymore we
[16:34] don't care what people think anymore
[16:36] we're just going to worship because at
[16:38] the end of the day worship is about him
[16:41] anyway it's not about your peers that
[16:42] are around you
