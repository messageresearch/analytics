[1:06:29] you grateful for these musicians
[1:06:32] worship leading
[1:06:36] [Applause]
[1:06:41] did anybody see the
[1:06:44] social media post where Joshua is the
[1:06:48] host of our new podcast
[1:06:51] well he did an amazing job a phenomenal
[1:06:54] job and I was more nervous than he was
[1:07:00] I've only been interviewed thousands of
[1:07:02] times but not never by my son
[1:07:07] and I was just so thankful that as we
[1:07:10] got started he had read the testimony
[1:07:13] book
[1:07:14] finally it took him his whole life
[1:07:17] and he said I read write the vision last
[1:07:20] night Dad
[1:07:21] and so he he had some amazing questions
[1:07:24] and we found out that two hours of
[1:07:27] conversation wasn't enough so we'll have
[1:07:30] to do it again and he's going to
[1:07:32] interview some of you so you better be
[1:07:34] getting your testimony together and your
[1:07:37] ducks in a row because we want to share
[1:07:39] with people around the world that we're
[1:07:42] serving a God who is just as good and
[1:07:44] just as real and just as powerful today
[1:07:47] as he always was
[1:07:49] he hasn't lost his power
[1:07:52] he's doing today what he's always done
[1:07:56] this time he's doing it in his many
[1:07:58] membered body through his many membered
[1:08:02] body would you turn in your Bible this
[1:08:05] evening and I'm I'm serious when I ask
[1:08:08] you if you've got your Bible with you
[1:08:10] tonight I know that's a rare thing would
[1:08:13] you get it and hold it in your hand
[1:08:17] and uh
[1:08:19] I I like to have my Bible with me
[1:08:22] because I like to I like to remember
[1:08:25] where something is on the page
[1:08:28] sometimes I can't remember the address
[1:08:30] but I can remember where where it is on
[1:08:33] the page so I I have another way of
[1:08:36] remembering I like to Mark in my Bible I
[1:08:39] came from strict Holiness and uh they
[1:08:42] didn't believe in marking in their Bible
[1:08:44] some of the folks that I went to church
[1:08:46] with they didn't believe in in marking
[1:08:48] in their Bible I'm so glad I got
[1:08:50] delivered from that
[1:08:52] because I locked a mark in mind I don't
[1:08:55] believe it offends the Lord
[1:08:59] I like to Mark mine so I can go back and
[1:09:02] read it again and you know sometimes
[1:09:04] when I'm marking in it I'm thinking what
[1:09:06] are these days I'm not going to be here
[1:09:08] to read this if Jesus tarries but
[1:09:11] somebody's going to read what this
[1:09:13] scripture meant to me
[1:09:15] and may it have the same effect on them
[1:09:18] so so don't give away or get rid of your
[1:09:21] your paperback Bible hold on to that
[1:09:24] it's nice to have and I say paperback is
[1:09:27] written on paper and maybe you're maybe
[1:09:30] your cover's a little fancier than that
[1:09:32] I I want you to know tonight that I had
[1:09:36] another another lesson or two plan for
[1:09:39] this weekend and in the night last night
[1:09:42] the Lord visited me in a relatively I
[1:09:45] would say profound way I'm thankful for
[1:09:48] that and he changed my mind and he put
[1:09:52] me in a spin because I didn't know if I
[1:09:55] could pull it together in time but we'll
[1:09:57] just see what the Lord will do Genesis
[1:10:00] chapter 22 is where we're going to begin
[1:10:03] this evening and we're going to read the
[1:10:05] first four verses The Book of Genesis in
[1:10:09] Hebrew is barashit and bearish sheep in
[1:10:13] Hebrew means Beginnings it is the book
[1:10:16] of beginnings
[1:10:17] brother Branham said that Satan hates
[1:10:20] the first book of the Bible and the last
[1:10:23] book of the Bible above all the rest I
[1:10:25] believe he hates it all
[1:10:28] but his origin is told in Genesis and
[1:10:31] his demise
[1:10:32] is revealed in Revelation if he did you
[1:10:36] know if he can confuse you in the Garden
[1:10:38] of Eden
[1:10:41] he can confuse you all the way through
[1:10:45] if you can't get an understanding of how
[1:10:47] sin started in the first place you won't
[1:10:50] understand how precious it is that he
[1:10:53] shed his own blood
[1:10:57] had to be blood
[1:11:02] you can't get blood out of a turnip
[1:11:04] that's what Cain found out it had to be
[1:11:08] blood it had to be Lamb's blood
[1:11:11] amen a verse 1 and it came to pass after
[1:11:15] these things
[1:11:16] that God did tempt or test Abraham
[1:11:23] and said unto him Abraham
[1:11:26] and he said behold here I am
[1:11:30] I want you to know tonight church that's
[1:11:33] a good answer
[1:11:34] Lord calls to you your answer ought to
[1:11:38] be yes Lord here I am
[1:11:41] I'm listening I want to obey you and the
[1:11:44] Lord said take now thy son thine only
[1:11:48] son isak Isaac whom thou lovest and get
[1:11:54] thee into the land of Moria
[1:11:58] are we pronounce it in English Moriah
[1:12:02] and offer him there for a burnt offering
[1:12:07] in Hebrew that is hola
[1:12:10] and that word Ola means literally to be
[1:12:15] completely consumed by fire
[1:12:19] it is the root word for Holocaust
[1:12:23] it was a great burning that took place
[1:12:26] this Holocaust I want you to notice
[1:12:30] while you're standing tonight that
[1:12:32] Abraham was not only called to come and
[1:12:36] slay his son
[1:12:38] but he was called to do something that
[1:12:42] the Jews were commanded not to do in the
[1:12:45] sense they believed that the physical
[1:12:48] body is sacred
[1:12:50] and to burn the body or to cremate the
[1:12:53] body is considered Pagan and Heathen to
[1:12:57] the Jewish people
[1:12:59] and so it was a lamb or it was a bullock
[1:13:03] or it was some other animal life that
[1:13:06] was to be offered on the altar as an Ola
[1:13:10] as a burnt offering never a human being
[1:13:14] but now God in tempting and testing
[1:13:17] Abraham said take now thy son thine only
[1:13:20] son leaving leaving Ishmael out of the
[1:13:24] picture altogether whom thou lovest and
[1:13:27] get thee into the land of Moriah and
[1:13:30] offer him there for a burnt offering
[1:13:33] upon one of the mountains
[1:13:35] which I will tell thee of
[1:13:39] now I want you to know God doesn't
[1:13:41] download all the instructions at one
[1:13:44] time
[1:13:46] so if you're waiting on the download to
[1:13:48] come with the rest of your life written
[1:13:50] down
[1:13:51] but he'll give you the next step
[1:13:55] and if you'll take that step well I felt
[1:13:58] that
[1:13:59] if you'll take that next step he'll give
[1:14:01] you the next step and the next and the
[1:14:04] next
[1:14:05] and he rose up and went unto the place
[1:14:08] of which God had told him he just told
[1:14:10] him the region of Moriah or Moriah which
[1:14:15] is a it's a huge range of mountains that
[1:14:19] that have various names today one of
[1:14:23] which is mount scopus in Jerusalem if
[1:14:26] you're there and you might be interested
[1:14:29] to know that Golgotha or Calvary was
[1:14:32] also a part of Moriah or the same
[1:14:35] mountain range of Moriah
[1:14:39] Abraham rose up early in the morning and
[1:14:43] saddled his ass and took two of his
[1:14:46] young men with him just servant boys
[1:14:49] and Isaac his son Enclave the wood for
[1:14:54] the burnt offering so I want you to
[1:14:57] notice that Isaac is packing the wood
[1:15:01] that's going to be used to burn his body
[1:15:06] I want you to see him climbing up the
[1:15:08] hill
[1:15:09] with that load of wood on his back
[1:15:13] the precious son
[1:15:15] of a loving father
[1:15:18] because some 4 000 years later
[1:15:21] scene is going to be repeated again and
[1:15:25] not only repeat it again but on the same
[1:15:27] Mountain
[1:15:28] at the very same spot
[1:15:31] another son is going to carry another
[1:15:34] stack of wood up a hill
[1:15:37] and his life is going to be given
[1:15:42] he rose up and went unto the place which
[1:15:46] God had told him now verse 4.
[1:15:49] then on the third day this is always
[1:15:51] very significant when we read about the
[1:15:54] third day
[1:15:55] then on the third day Abraham I want you
[1:15:58] to hear this
[1:16:00] we're going to look at this in just a
[1:16:02] moment in Hebrew and it's going to say
[1:16:04] something to you that it won't say to
[1:16:06] you in English
[1:16:07] then on the third day Abraham lifted up
[1:16:10] his eyes
[1:16:12] and saw the place
[1:16:17] read it for me
[1:16:19] afar off
[1:16:20] verse 5. and Abraham said unto his young
[1:16:25] men abide ye here with the ass and I am
[1:16:29] the land will go Yonder and worship and
[1:16:34] come again to you may God add his
[1:16:38] Blessing on the reading of his word you
[1:16:40] may be seated this evening I know I
[1:16:43] always ask for your attention
[1:16:47] sometimes when it's just the local
[1:16:50] church
[1:16:51] I demand it
[1:16:53] but it's not because I think I'm so
[1:16:56] special
[1:16:57] but I want you to know the word that I'm
[1:16:59] bringing to you tonight is life
[1:17:02] it's the most valuable this book
[1:17:05] testifies of the most valuable
[1:17:08] possession that any man could ever
[1:17:10] accept into his life The Living Word of
[1:17:14] God we're not worshiping a book
[1:17:17] we're not making a God out of a book but
[1:17:21] we're understanding that that book
[1:17:23] preserves the written record of who God
[1:17:27] is
[1:17:28] who he was what he did what he will do
[1:17:32] what he's doing now
[1:17:35] it is according to the Apostle John in
[1:17:40] the beginning was the word and the word
[1:17:44] was
[1:17:45] with God and the word
[1:17:47] was God and the word became
[1:17:51] flesh and dwelt Among Us not taking away
[1:17:56] from the father
[1:17:58] but reflecting to us the Father the Son
[1:18:02] was the perfect image
[1:18:04] of the father
[1:18:06] can you say Amen Jesus Yeshua said when
[1:18:10] you have seen me
[1:18:13] you you pray to see the father you
[1:18:16] always want to see the father I'm
[1:18:18] standing in the midst of you
[1:18:21] you don't even know who I am
[1:18:23] you don't even recognize that when
[1:18:25] you've seen me you have seen the father
[1:18:29] Abraham was given in those few verses of
[1:18:33] scripture a divine revelation from God
[1:18:36] offer you'd suck Isaac your only son as
[1:18:42] an offering to God not just an offering
[1:18:45] you're not just going to slay him
[1:18:48] you're not just gonna let him bleed out
[1:18:52] but you're going to set him on fire
[1:18:56] on this mountain
[1:18:57] I want you to understand this is serious
[1:19:00] business here
[1:19:02] this is life or death and we mean that
[1:19:04] literally
[1:19:05] Abraham had to know he had to really
[1:19:08] believe in this God that's talking to
[1:19:11] him
[1:19:13] sometimes the Lord tells somebody to put
[1:19:16] a five dollar bill in an offering and
[1:19:17] they struggle with it and want to pray
[1:19:20] about it I'm not taking an offering
[1:19:22] but they want to pray about him fast
[1:19:24] about it let me fast a while let me pray
[1:19:27] a while let me see if I can get rid of
[1:19:29] that five dollar bill what if the Lord
[1:19:30] were to come and say now
[1:19:34] I want you to move out of your house
[1:19:37] and I want you to give it to so and so
[1:19:43] or what if God were to say you know your
[1:19:45] brother could use a a Dependable way to
[1:19:48] get around but Lord
[1:19:50] I'm still making payments on mine and
[1:19:53] the Lord says what if he were to say and
[1:19:55] you still can
[1:19:57] but I want you to give that automobile
[1:19:59] to your brother
[1:20:01] oh it's quiet
[1:20:04] I'm not prophesying to you
[1:20:07] oh somebody said don't let him look at
[1:20:09] me don't let him look at me you know
[1:20:11] better than that I'm not going to tell
[1:20:12] you to do something like that but what
[1:20:14] if your papa did
[1:20:16] what if your Ava God did
[1:20:19] I I I don't think in our minds that we
[1:20:23] can hardly relate to this story because
[1:20:26] we are not in any way expecting that God
[1:20:30] would tell us that we should sacrifice
[1:20:34] the life of our own son
[1:20:37] but as the songwriter said I dare to say
[1:20:42] that most of us
[1:20:45] have an Isaac
[1:20:47] standing in our way
[1:20:51] something that we hold on to
[1:20:55] something that we treasure
[1:20:57] something that we love above other
[1:20:59] things and what would we do if God were
[1:21:02] to come by
[1:21:04] and he were to say it's it's over
[1:21:08] it's over you've got to give him to me
[1:21:10] you've got to give her to me you've got
[1:21:12] to give the job to me what if you loved
[1:21:14] where you lived and all of a sudden God
[1:21:17] said I want you to pack up and go
[1:21:19] halfway across the country
[1:21:21] what if it were a place like like
[1:21:24] Alabama like Georgia
[1:21:27] like red clay
[1:21:30] who can love this Red Dirt
[1:21:36] I do
[1:21:38] not because it's my favorite stuff
[1:21:41] there are plenty I've been all over the
[1:21:43] world and over 65 countries I think the
[1:21:46] last time I tried to add them up
[1:21:49] at least 60
[1:21:51] and I know that I have seen some
[1:21:54] beautiful places
[1:21:55] but God doesn't always call us to the
[1:21:58] places that are the most beautiful
[1:22:00] but you better know that if he slips by
[1:22:03] your way and says
[1:22:06] I'm thinking about Hawk back there he's
[1:22:08] from the one of the most beautiful
[1:22:10] places in all the world is Iceland if
[1:22:13] you've never been there that's one of
[1:22:15] the most beautiful places I've ever been
[1:22:17] Norway maybe right up there with it you
[1:22:19] you've never seen maybe so much natural
[1:22:22] beauty in all your life but when the
[1:22:24] Lord comes by and said I had to work for
[1:22:26] you to do in Alabama
[1:22:28] then you're laying an Isaac on the Altar
[1:22:31] and you're saying Lord
[1:22:33] I must obey you
[1:22:36] I must follow your voice
[1:22:39] what if God comes by and a woman's got
[1:22:42] on a pair of slacks and the Lord were to
[1:22:44] say to her I'm going to take those I I
[1:22:46] want you to lay those down you know and
[1:22:49] and they're very comfortable to her and
[1:22:51] it's all she's ever known and she's grew
[1:22:53] up like that and she works like that and
[1:22:56] she's she just really believes that but
[1:22:58] what if the Lord were to come by and say
[1:22:59] I've got another life for you to live
[1:23:03] then what else could that woman do
[1:23:07] but to say Lord I'll follow you no
[1:23:09] matter what the cost
[1:23:11] what if the Lord were to pass by a woman
[1:23:13] who's used to keeping her hair as short
[1:23:15] as a man's and the Lord were to come by
[1:23:18] and say I want the glory of the Lord to
[1:23:20] be on your head reflected by your long
[1:23:23] hair
[1:23:24] would you really stand in God's presence
[1:23:27] and argue about your hair
[1:23:30] or would you just obey what the word
[1:23:32] said and keep the scissors out of your
[1:23:35] hair anybody with me tonight
[1:23:37] there's nothing that God couldn't
[1:23:38] require of any of us that wouldn't be
[1:23:41] worth the payment worth the sacrifice
[1:23:44] if God calls you to leave something
[1:23:46] behind he's got something greater for
[1:23:48] you
[1:23:50] and I want you to know Abraham had a
[1:23:52] revelation that this voice was the same
[1:23:55] voice that called him out of Earth of
[1:23:57] the counties
[1:23:58] the voice that spoke to Abraham the son
[1:24:01] of an idol maker
[1:24:03] in a pagan land in a foreign land
[1:24:06] worshiping hundreds of gods and a voice
[1:24:09] said get me up Abraham away from thy
[1:24:12] Kindred into a lamb that I will show
[1:24:14] thee
[1:24:15] and Abraham had to make a decision then
[1:24:18] to get up and follow a God that he'd
[1:24:20] never met and a God that he didn't even
[1:24:22] know his name
[1:24:26] who in this room would follow a God you
[1:24:28] didn't even know his name Abraham did
[1:24:31] went to a place he didn't even know
[1:24:32] existed
[1:24:34] stood up there in the heights of uh of a
[1:24:38] moray up in the top of the northern part
[1:24:41] of Israel looking over down over the
[1:24:43] city of shechaman and God let him look
[1:24:46] and see that beautiful land that he had
[1:24:49] never seen before and God said I'm going
[1:24:51] to give it to you and I'm going to
[1:24:53] multiply your seed well I want you to
[1:24:55] know Abraham could have took from that
[1:24:57] promise that it was all going to be easy
[1:24:59] and that all the inhabitants of the land
[1:25:01] were going to bow down and and you know
[1:25:03] except him as their new leader
[1:25:06] vote him in as president
[1:25:09] he could have thought by God's words
[1:25:11] that everything was going to go smoothly
[1:25:13] but how many of you know it didn't
[1:25:15] indeed excuse me it didn't indeed go
[1:25:17] smoothly at all
[1:25:18] there were struggle after struggle after
[1:25:21] struggle after struggle but God gave
[1:25:24] Abraham the strength that he needed to
[1:25:26] be obedient to The Voice
[1:25:29] and now the final test
[1:25:33] we're entering in are you are you going
[1:25:36] to stay with me this evening maybe a
[1:25:39] little slow
[1:25:40] we're entering into Passover season this
[1:25:42] week
[1:25:44] we're not only entering into Passover
[1:25:46] but we're entering into a Passover that
[1:25:49] is identical on the Gregorian calendar
[1:25:51] to the Passover that brother Brandon was
[1:25:55] born in
[1:25:57] and so it follows the days of the week
[1:26:00] this year just like it did the year that
[1:26:03] brother Branham was born somehow I have
[1:26:05] to feel like there's a little bit of a
[1:26:07] significance in that so I'm watching the
[1:26:09] days
[1:26:11] today is the tenth day of Nissan or of
[1:26:15] abib if you look at the if you look at
[1:26:18] the month in the Bible it is Habib
[1:26:21] and today is the 10th day of the month
[1:26:24] which is a very important day and we'll
[1:26:27] talk about that a little bit later in
[1:26:29] our service tonight or tomorrow
[1:26:33] but as we begin to look at this Passover
[1:26:36] time and we begin to look at how God
[1:26:39] come down and move to the children of
[1:26:42] Israel out of Egyptian slavery and how
[1:26:45] they went from slavery to Sons
[1:26:49] and as God made a way where there was no
[1:26:52] way God was calling them out of Egypt
[1:26:55] but he didn't leave them to figure it
[1:26:56] out on their own I need some help
[1:27:00] he was there with them every step of the
[1:27:02] way how many of you believe that he
[1:27:04] opened up the Red Sea he opened up the
[1:27:07] Jordan River he fed them when they were
[1:27:09] hungry he gave them water when they were
[1:27:11] thirsty when the water was poisoned he
[1:27:14] gave them away to make it pure
[1:27:17] he was with them every step of the way I
[1:27:19] challenge you in the name of the Lord
[1:27:21] Jesus Christ to leave here with this
[1:27:23] reality tonight you will have the Lord
[1:27:26] with you every step of the way if you
[1:27:29] are following his voice
[1:27:32] if you're doing what he's telling you to
[1:27:34] do he will never leave you he will never
[1:27:38] forsake you
[1:27:39] if you don't obey him he may pull back a
[1:27:42] little bit and let you find out what it
[1:27:44] means to live in the permissive will of
[1:27:46] God but if you'll obey him if you'll say
[1:27:49] Lord I'm waiting but I'm ready I'm ready
[1:27:51] but I'm I'm waiting but I'm ready to do
[1:27:53] whatever you tell me to do
[1:27:55] I feel like the Lord is calling many of
[1:27:58] us not just a handful but many of us to
[1:28:01] a higher place of consecration brother
[1:28:04] random said we've gone as far with God
[1:28:06] as we're going to go until we're willing
[1:28:08] to pay a greater price
[1:28:09] some of you are going to pay a greater
[1:28:12] price in this Supernatural year that
[1:28:14] we're living in right now but I
[1:28:16] encourage you now before it comes I
[1:28:19] encourage you now to know that he will
[1:28:21] provide he is Jehovah yah Ray he is
[1:28:25] Jehovah Jireh he is the god who will
[1:28:28] provide he will never ask anything of us
[1:28:31] that he will not provide for us
[1:28:35] he is involved in every aspect of our
[1:28:38] life that we will let him be
[1:28:40] he's a god of detail and he wants to be
[1:28:43] with you in your details
[1:28:45] can you trust him
[1:28:48] can you trust him
[1:28:50] is there anybody in this room that's
[1:28:51] ever found a reason not to trust God
[1:28:54] you say well I prayed one time and it
[1:28:57] didn't turn out the way I wanted it to
[1:28:59] turn out I want you to know we're not in
[1:29:01] charge here
[1:29:03] we're serving a sovereign-minded god
[1:29:06] who has a plan that's bigger than our
[1:29:09] plan and bigger he said I want to do for
[1:29:12] you exceeding abundantly above
[1:29:15] that which you could even are you here
[1:29:19] that which you could even ask or think
[1:29:21] so Abraham gets a direct I've got to
[1:29:24] hurry he gets a direct Revelation from
[1:29:26] God all for Isaac as a burnt offering he
[1:29:28] told him he would inform him which
[1:29:30] mountain to do this on you just head in
[1:29:33] the right direction and when you get
[1:29:35] closer I'll show you the very Mountain
[1:29:37] that I want you to go and the Bible
[1:29:39] tells us right here in verse 4 that on
[1:29:42] the third day
[1:29:45] he lifted up his eyes
[1:29:49] and when the Bible uses this kind of
[1:29:51] terminology it's Hebrew
[1:29:53] we have the English translation of it
[1:29:55] but when the Bible uses this kind of
[1:29:58] language it is to call our attention
[1:30:01] emphatically to what is going to follow
[1:30:05] you know otherwise it would have just
[1:30:07] said he glanced and that's what he saw
[1:30:09] he didn't say he glanced
[1:30:12] it didn't say he searched for
[1:30:14] it said he lifted up his eyes
[1:30:17] and I want you to know something that's
[1:30:19] some of what we're going to have to do
[1:30:20] in this hour
[1:30:22] there's a lot of things to make us heavy
[1:30:25] there's a lot of things that happen in
[1:30:27] life to weigh us down there are a lot of
[1:30:29] things that we don't understand and if
[1:30:31] we get under the depression of
[1:30:33] circumstances and we hang our head down
[1:30:36] we may miss what God's trying to show us
[1:30:39] and it may be even in this hour that the
[1:30:41] Lord is calling some of us like Abraham
[1:30:43] lift up your eyes
[1:30:46] even as the scripture said lift up your
[1:30:49] head
[1:30:51] even as the Bible tells us as that day
[1:30:54] of redemption draws nigh we lift up our
[1:30:57] head
[1:30:58] we look to the Hills from which cometh
[1:31:01] our help you may not know what your
[1:31:04] tomorrow holds but God Holds Tomorrow
[1:31:09] if you can trust God you don't have to
[1:31:12] worry about your tomorrow
[1:31:14] anybody with me
[1:31:16] some of us have been serving the lord
[1:31:18] all these years and we are still
[1:31:20] learning to lean and we are still
[1:31:24] learning to trust you interview some of
[1:31:27] these Old-Timers in this house and you
[1:31:30] ask them if it's the right thing to do
[1:31:32] to trust the Lord and they will tell you
[1:31:34] through thick
[1:31:37] through thin through good times through
[1:31:41] bad times
[1:31:42] times of plenty
[1:31:45] times of nothing
[1:31:47] it's the right thing to do to trust the
[1:31:49] Lord he'll never lead you to something
[1:31:52] wrong
[1:31:53] he'll only lead you to a closer walk
[1:31:55] with him he'll only lead you to
[1:31:58] something better for you if you'll
[1:32:00] follow him
[1:32:02] and so in verse in verse 5 genesis 22 we
[1:32:06] read we got some more Foundation to lay
[1:32:08] here before we get to where we need to
[1:32:10] go Abraham said to the young man I want
[1:32:13] you to stay here with the with the ass
[1:32:16] and I and the lad will go Yonder and
[1:32:19] worship and we will come back to you now
[1:32:22] here is how we know that Abraham has a
[1:32:26] revelation
[1:32:27] because he and only he knew what was
[1:32:31] about to take place on that mountain
[1:32:34] only he knew what the instructions were
[1:32:37] these young men that were with him knew
[1:32:39] that there was going to be a sacrifice
[1:32:41] but they didn't know it was to be Isaac
[1:32:43] the only son of Abraham so when Abraham
[1:32:47] turned to them and said you all just
[1:32:48] stay here I'm going up yonder with my
[1:32:51] son we're going to worship
[1:32:54] and we're going to I and the land
[1:32:59] that's revelation
[1:33:01] I am the land somebody said he must have
[1:33:04] known that God was going to let him off
[1:33:06] the hook not so
[1:33:11] he had no idea that God was going to let
[1:33:13] him off the hook it surprised Abraham as
[1:33:17] much as it would surprise any of you to
[1:33:19] hear the voice of God tell you one thing
[1:33:21] and then keep you from doing what he
[1:33:23] told you to do but what he did know
[1:33:25] according to the New Testament was that
[1:33:28] the God who commanded that he go up on
[1:33:30] that mountain was a god of life and a
[1:33:33] god of Resurrection
[1:33:36] and Abraham went with a revelation and a
[1:33:39] persuasion that if I kill my son
[1:33:42] and if I set him on fire help me now and
[1:33:47] if there's nothing left but a pile of
[1:33:50] Ashes when I'm through I serve the god
[1:33:53] of the impossible
[1:33:58] I serve the god of the impossible
[1:34:02] give me a little more in the house
[1:34:05] I serve the god of the impossible
[1:34:09] I don't know how he's going to make it I
[1:34:11] don't know how he's going to look I
[1:34:12] don't know how he's going to do it in
[1:34:13] the resurrection
[1:34:16] but I just stood over my mother like
[1:34:18] many of you have stood over your loved
[1:34:19] ones and we say just what the Bible said
[1:34:22] here they return to dust
[1:34:25] and here they return to ashes but one of
[1:34:28] these days I don't know how God's going
[1:34:30] to do it but he's going to do it
[1:34:33] he's going to swing by that Cemetery
[1:34:35] with a new body
[1:34:39] I don't know how God's gonna do it but
[1:34:41] Abraham said I don't know how this is
[1:34:43] going to turn out but if
[1:34:45] if I indeed give my son
[1:34:48] as an Orla to God has a burnt offering
[1:34:51] to God I trust that this same God who
[1:34:56] has proven himself faithful will raise
[1:35:00] my son up again and these these boys
[1:35:02] here they may never know what happens on
[1:35:04] that mountain because in the same way
[1:35:06] they see me going off with my son I plan
[1:35:08] to come back with him
[1:35:10] brother that's faith no wonder the Bible
[1:35:13] looks over some of Abraham's mistakes
[1:35:19] no wonder the Bible said he staggered
[1:35:21] not at the promises of God even though
[1:35:23] he got involved and helped God out and
[1:35:26] and produced a a false seed
[1:35:29] by his concubine Hagar
[1:35:32] Ishmael then he had to drive him into
[1:35:34] the Wilderness and if you know anything
[1:35:36] about political or geographical or
[1:35:38] geopolitical situations in the Middle
[1:35:40] East you know that the The World Is
[1:35:43] Still reeling
[1:35:45] the world is still dealing with the sons
[1:35:47] of Ishmael
[1:35:49] that wasn't God's idea Ishmael wasn't
[1:35:51] God's idea was Abraham's idea but God
[1:35:54] loved Abraham
[1:35:56] that's what the prophet said
[1:35:58] and he allowed Abraham to have this this
[1:36:02] way this will this thought this idea
[1:36:05] then Ishmael gets old enough that he
[1:36:08] starts mocking the promised son and he
[1:36:10] had to drive him out into the Wilderness
[1:36:12] with his mother not knowing even what
[1:36:14] would happen to them out there I'm
[1:36:15] telling you if if anybody knew what it
[1:36:18] means to separate yourself from the
[1:36:20] things you love
[1:36:22] I need some help
[1:36:25] I know I'm on the trail but I still need
[1:36:27] a little help here it was Abraham
[1:36:31] but he trusted God
[1:36:34] he was a friend to God
[1:36:37] he known God
[1:36:38] I would like to think that there are
[1:36:40] some Sons some spiritual sons of Abraham
[1:36:44] in this house
[1:36:46] brother Branham said that little bride
[1:36:48] is from the Royal seed
[1:36:51] she may not all be Jews
[1:36:53] she may not all be from the natural
[1:36:55] loins of Abraham but he said she's the
[1:36:58] Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:37:00] how many of the royal Seed of Abraham is
[1:37:03] in this house tonight then no less
[1:37:07] than no last in the faith Abraham had is
[1:37:10] going to get you and I through got to

[1:37:56] we're fighting the greatest battle ever
[1:37:59] fought but we must have the faith of

[1:39:31] up and say
[1:39:34] oh all is
[1:39:37] well
[1:39:42] you've put my picture up
[1:39:52] this is one of my favorite Bible
[1:39:54] paintings
[1:39:56] I had a copy but I gave it to a friend
[1:39:59] and I don't that's the only copy I have
[1:40:01] of it now it's a little grainy
[1:40:04] but I want you to look at what we see
[1:40:06] here we see Abraham
[1:40:09] with a with a knife a sword of some sort
[1:40:13] in his hand
[1:40:16] we see a little altar that he's built
[1:40:18] and his son tied to the Altar and we see
[1:40:23] the wood
[1:40:24] stacked there and and and and and we see
[1:40:28] Abraham lifting up his eyes
[1:40:34] he's catching a glimpse of the Holy
[1:40:36] Temple
[1:40:40] if you and I can just lift up our eyes
[1:40:43] and catch a glimpse of what's waiting on
[1:40:45] us over there in eternity I believe
[1:40:47] you'll run on
[1:40:49] I believe if your spiritual eyes could
[1:40:51] be open tonight and you could catch one
[1:40:54] glimpse of that Eternal City you'd run
[1:40:56] on
[1:40:58] I believe you'd pray on and you'd read
[1:41:01] on and you'd Press On
[1:41:04] and I believe if you felt discouragement
[1:41:06] coming you'd Shake It Off and you'd say
[1:41:09] I've got to run this race
[1:41:12] I've got so much waiting for me over
[1:41:15] there
[1:41:17] the Bible said here in verse 5 and I am
[1:41:21] the lad
[1:41:23] now I want to just say this to you some
[1:41:25] of you know my studies
[1:41:27] while I was in Jerusalem on this
[1:41:29] particular subject
[1:41:31] I understand that brother Branham said
[1:41:33] that Abraham's son Isaac had had reached
[1:41:37] the age of 12.
[1:41:39] and and I don't know if that was under
[1:41:42] inspiration or if it was just his
[1:41:45] thought I don't know and I'm not going
[1:41:47] to say to you anything contrary to that
[1:41:50] because I respect and honor the office
[1:41:53] that brother Branham held
[1:41:56] but I also understand that every every
[1:41:59] detail of every story he told and and
[1:42:03] every reference that he made may or may
[1:42:06] not have been inspired and since we
[1:42:09] don't know whether it was or not we look
[1:42:12] to the word
[1:42:14] how many of you know we have to he told
[1:42:16] us to look to that word so don't you
[1:42:19] misunderstand me tonight I'm not in any
[1:42:22] way trying to take away from what
[1:42:24] brother random said but I want you to
[1:42:25] know that that word lad there
[1:42:28] it can mean more than a little boy
[1:42:32] it can mean a boy or a young man
[1:42:36] in fact it means in its in its rudiest
[1:42:40] form when you take that word lad all the
[1:42:44] way back to the bottom and the base of
[1:42:46] its root it actually means a man who is
[1:42:51] old enough to serve in the battle
[1:42:56] so I'm only saying that because as the
[1:43:00] Jews believe there is a possibility
[1:43:03] that Isaac was much older than 12 years
[1:43:06] old
[1:43:07] would somebody like to would somebody
[1:43:10] like to guess how old the Jews believe
[1:43:12] Isaac was when he went up on the
[1:43:14] mountain with his father that day
[1:43:16] anybody like to guess if you don't know
[1:43:21] 37 who said 37.
[1:43:26] you've got your notes
[1:43:29] 37
[1:43:30] 7 is there anybody in this room 37
[1:43:36] only Michael
[1:43:38] you're 36. almost 37. come up here
[1:43:43] Michael
[1:43:46] I'm going to sacrifice you on this altar
[1:43:55] I don't know if he were I don't know how
[1:43:56] old he was I'm just telling you the word
[1:43:59] doesn't necessarily mean little boy
[1:44:01] in Hebrew and there are other words
[1:44:05] in the in the language of this story
[1:44:08] that lead the Jewish Scholars and sages
[1:44:10] to believe that he was a grown man of 37
[1:44:13] and he had not yet met Rebecca
[1:44:16] he was not yet married
[1:44:18] now you know I'm I'm fat
[1:44:25] that was a good chance Daniel brother
[1:44:27] Daniel for you to say Mercy
[1:44:32] but he didn't want if you can't say Amen
[1:44:34] say Mercy
[1:44:36] I'm a big old man I could do a lot of
[1:44:39] damage sitting on Michael
[1:44:42] but I may not be as strong as Michael
[1:44:44] I'm feeling around on his arms and he
[1:44:47] lifts and he works and he's a strong
[1:44:49] pretty strong guy
[1:44:51] and and what I'm trying to imagine here
[1:44:54] is Abraham if indeed let's just suppose
[1:44:57] can we suppose can you streamers give me
[1:45:00] a little Mercy
[1:45:03] and let's suppose
[1:45:05] you're already on your computer trying
[1:45:07] to search out what brother Graham said
[1:45:09] couldn't you just give me a minute and
[1:45:11] let's suppose together
[1:45:13] because I just want to make a point here
[1:45:16] there had to be something between Isaac
[1:45:19] and Abraham
[1:45:21] there had to be a measure of trust so
[1:45:23] not only did Abraham trust his daddy
[1:45:27] but Isaac had to trust his daddy
[1:45:31] if he was going to carry the wood up
[1:45:34] there all up the hill and lay down I
[1:45:37] mean can you imagine they get there on
[1:45:39] the way up go sit down thank you so much
[1:45:43] can you imagine they he asked the
[1:45:45] question Dad I see the the wood
[1:45:52] but where is the sacrifice
[1:45:58] Abraham had Resurrection Faith because
[1:46:00] he told the men to remain where they
[1:46:02] were because he and Isaac were going to
[1:46:04] the mountain and both would return back
[1:46:06] to them again
[1:46:08] somebody say Abraham's faith
[1:46:11] then in Genesis 22 charity verse 6 and
[1:46:14] we'll have this picture again and or you
[1:46:17] can do that
[1:46:22] and Abraham took the wood of the burnt
[1:46:25] offering and laid it upon Isaac his son
[1:46:27] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[1:46:31] knife and they went both of them
[1:46:33] together
[1:46:35] and Isaac spake unto Abraham's father so
[1:46:38] now it doesn't matter to me what you see
[1:46:40] now in your mind you may say who's 12
[1:46:42] years old let me let me have a 12 year
[1:46:44] old come here little Feller
[1:46:48] what's your name
[1:46:50] said Levi that's is that right Levi
[1:46:53] that's a wonderful name you're named
[1:46:55] after your granddaddy Levi maybe and
[1:46:58] Levi in the Bible is that right
[1:47:00] your uncle all right come here and turn
[1:47:02] around
[1:47:03] Michael come back
[1:47:10] are you turning red Levi
[1:47:15] is this yours brother Isaac is this
[1:47:18] whose son is this whose son is this
[1:47:20] I forget you've got them all ages
[1:47:25] though it was your uncle
[1:47:27] I don't care in a moment when I finish
[1:47:30] reading these verses it doesn't matter
[1:47:31] to me if you see a boy Levi's age
[1:47:34] or if you see a young man Michael's age
[1:47:37] but I want you to see one of the two
[1:47:38] whichever you're more comfortable with
[1:47:41] I want you to have an image in your mind
[1:47:43] of of a boy or of a young man walking up
[1:47:47] Mount Moriah or Mount Moriah with his
[1:47:49] father Abraham how many of you can do
[1:47:51] that with me tonight thank you brother
[1:47:52] so much
[1:47:56] and and whatever age he was or whatever
[1:47:59] size he was he says to Abraham
[1:48:03] my father
[1:48:09] now father can sound like such a
[1:48:12] reverential title but because he said my
[1:48:15] father he really called him Papa
[1:48:20] the Hebrew word is ABBA and I have told
[1:48:23] you before there's nothing like being in
[1:48:26] Jerusalem on air Shabbat
[1:48:30] the day of Friday
[1:48:32] and all the Jewish people have come to
[1:48:35] the shook to the market to buy their
[1:48:38] food for Shabbat and to prepare their
[1:48:40] meal and to buy their flowers for the
[1:48:42] table and to get everything ready for
[1:48:44] Shabbat that begins at sundown and it
[1:48:48] gets very crowded there on Fridays we
[1:48:50] lost brother West there on a Friday one
[1:48:53] time it gets very very crowded
[1:48:57] and he said he was lost we were lost but
[1:49:00] but the thing is we were all lost
[1:49:02] together and he was lost by itself but
[1:49:05] we met up and that's all that matters
[1:49:07] sister West we met up that's what
[1:49:09] matters
[1:49:11] but anyway and and the crowd there and
[1:49:14] you know the Orthodox Jews have a lot of
[1:49:16] children they must be somehow kind of
[1:49:18] like the Amish they have a lot of
[1:49:20] children
[1:49:21] and uh they they take a few with them to
[1:49:25] the Shook and it's usually Daddy because
[1:49:27] mama's home busy
[1:49:29] there's nothing like the sound of the
[1:49:32] crowd those little kids going everywhere
[1:49:34] and and one once once in a while a one
[1:49:37] about two years old or three years old
[1:49:39] will get lost from his dad
[1:49:43] he doesn't really panic
[1:49:45] he just calls out Abba
[1:49:50] Abba
[1:49:52] it's amazing to me
[1:49:55] every little boy you hear a little boy
[1:49:57] and his mother went to the shop it's IMA
[1:50:00] IMA Ima
[1:50:02] you may be hearing a dozen voices saying
[1:50:05] Abba but I want you to know every daddy
[1:50:08] that has taken his little boy to the
[1:50:10] ship he knows the sound of his child's
[1:50:13] voice and the mother knows the sound of
[1:50:17] their child's voice and when they say
[1:50:19] Emma or when they say it's it's my
[1:50:22] father my Abba he's calling to him with
[1:50:26] great affection and he says Abba and
[1:50:30] Abraham said here am I
[1:50:34] that's like you looking over there and
[1:50:36] say Here I Am what do you want
[1:50:38] here am I my son and he said behold this
[1:50:42] is Isaac again I see the fire
[1:50:46] it's in your hand I see the wood
[1:50:49] it's on my back
[1:50:51] but I have a question for you ABBA
[1:50:54] doesn't matter whether he was 12 years
[1:50:55] old or 37.
[1:50:58] his question is legitimate wouldn't you
[1:51:00] say
[1:51:01] because he has been told We're Going Up
[1:51:04] To Worship we're going up to give God an
[1:51:07] offering that we call sacrifice
[1:51:11] and it's legitimate to want to know
[1:51:13] where is the Lamb
[1:51:15] where is the ram where is the Bullock
[1:51:18] where is the dove
[1:51:21] what are we going to give to God how are
[1:51:26] we going to offer him
[1:51:28] something when we we have nothing where
[1:51:31] is the Lamb for the hola for the burnt
[1:51:35] offering are you with me
[1:51:36] let's go on
[1:51:38] and Abraham said my son
[1:51:41] whoo hear this
[1:51:43] my son
[1:51:47] there's such a relationship here
[1:51:51] my son
[1:51:53] God
[1:52:00] daddy house how's God going to help us
[1:52:02] out of this mess
[1:52:05] God will
[1:52:07] I don't know how
[1:52:10] but God will
[1:52:12] my own children asked me one time how
[1:52:14] are we ever going to get out from under
[1:52:16] this
[1:52:18] and my answer to them was I don't know
[1:52:21] but I know he does
[1:52:24] and we're going to trust him and he's
[1:52:27] going to bring us out of this because
[1:52:29] that's who he is my son God will provide
[1:52:33] himself a lamb for a burnt offering so
[1:52:37] they went both of them together I want
[1:52:39] you to notice this trusting relationship
[1:52:41] uh you know
[1:52:43] Isaac didn't say how's that going to
[1:52:45] happen dad and you know like if it was
[1:52:47] if it was tally or some of these
[1:52:49] children around here
[1:52:50] we love them but they'd ask you know
[1:52:52] they would ask oh my goodness would they
[1:52:54] ask where is tally is she in here she's
[1:52:57] not she can ask the biggest questions
[1:53:00] you've ever dealt with in your life
[1:53:02] and you you're you're torn in the middle
[1:53:04] between wanting to shut her up
[1:53:07] and remembering that that's how a child
[1:53:09] learns is to ask questions so you want
[1:53:12] to try to answer those questions but but
[1:53:15] but Isaac didn't say but Dad
[1:53:18] how is God going to give us a lamb
[1:53:21] how are we going to have a sacrifice can
[1:53:24] you give me the details he just okay
[1:53:30] it doesn't even say he
[1:53:32] said yay nay or anything just said they
[1:53:34] went together
[1:53:36] he didn't turn around and run he didn't
[1:53:37] go back down the mountain he just kept
[1:53:39] on walking
[1:53:40] are you with me
[1:53:42] all right verse 9 and they came to the
[1:53:44] place which God had told him of Moriah
[1:53:49] Mariah
[1:53:51] that's why my daughter's named Mariah
[1:53:54] because we were in Jerusalem when the
[1:53:56] lord gave us her name and told us to
[1:53:58] name her after the Holy Hill of God
[1:54:00] and there Abraham built an altar there
[1:54:03] and laid the wood in order
[1:54:06] as as you saw in the picture he stacked
[1:54:09] it in order
[1:54:10] and he bound Isaac his son
[1:54:13] and laid him on the altar
[1:54:16] upon the wood
[1:54:18] if it was Levi
[1:54:20] I think every one of you would believe
[1:54:23] that I had the power to over overpower I
[1:54:26] I have the strength and the girth and
[1:54:27] the size to overpower Levi
[1:54:30] I don't know he might have he might be a
[1:54:31] fighter
[1:54:34] but I don't think anybody struggles with
[1:54:36] the thought that I would be able to tie
[1:54:38] him up with the Rope
[1:54:40] folks you ain't got no confidence in me
[1:54:44] my goodness the way you people are I
[1:54:46] don't know my American British no more
[1:54:50] please help me out
[1:54:53] don't leave me here by myself
[1:54:57] but some of you are looking at Michael
[1:54:59] and you're thinking you know
[1:55:01] it might be a little harder
[1:55:06] but the Bible said he bound Isaac his
[1:55:09] son
[1:55:10] folks somebody had to let it happen
[1:55:13] Isaac had to be willing
[1:55:16] Isaac had to be yielded
[1:55:19] Isaac had to show honor and respect to
[1:55:22] his dad and to the faith of his death I
[1:55:25] want to propose to you that Isaac had
[1:55:27] some faith of his own
[1:55:30] I don't know what kind of experience he
[1:55:33] had had with the god of Abraham yet but
[1:55:35] I want you to know he trusted the
[1:55:37] relationship that he saw his dad having
[1:55:40] with the invisible God Daddy's
[1:55:47] daddies
[1:55:49] we must be living this kind of a lie
[1:55:53] so that our children have confidence in
[1:55:56] our relationship with God
[1:55:58] so that if we ever get in the situation
[1:56:00] where we can't explain why we'll be able
[1:56:03] to say because God said so
[1:56:09] and that settles it
[1:56:11] are you with me this evening
[1:56:13] so I personally like to show at least
[1:56:15] the Jewish thought
[1:56:18] okay maybe he was 12 years old but I
[1:56:21] tell you what he would have still had to
[1:56:23] have a lot of confidence in his dad to
[1:56:25] climb up on that altar
[1:56:29] I didn't see Michael jumping up here
[1:56:31] when I told him I was going to lay him
[1:56:33] on the altar I didn't see him run up
[1:56:34] there and lay down I believe there would
[1:56:36] have been a struggle under any other
[1:56:38] circumstance but but Abraham had such a
[1:56:41] faith and it was such a testimony to his
[1:56:43] family I want to say something here I
[1:56:46] want to say something here mothers and
[1:56:47] dads I want to say something to you in
[1:56:49] love if we win the whole neighborhood
[1:56:55] and lose our own children
[1:57:00] we've not really done anything for the
[1:57:02] kingdom of God
[1:57:04] a minister that will leave his family to
[1:57:07] go to the other side of the world
[1:57:09] without caring without concern without
[1:57:13] burden
[1:57:14] for what's going on in his own house and
[1:57:17] with his own children
[1:57:20] I challenge that kind of a movement and
[1:57:22] I wonder if that's Faith or Pride
[1:57:27] sometimes I think pride gets involved
[1:57:30] I want you to know there's a time to
[1:57:32] well aren't we supposed to serve God
[1:57:34] first and family later I want you to
[1:57:36] know the very first assignment that God
[1:57:39] gives to any man even before he makes
[1:57:43] him a minister of the Gospel is to be is
[1:57:45] to be a father to his children
[1:57:48] and a husband to his wife and I say that
[1:57:51] with full knowledge that I have failed
[1:57:54] mine multiple times I have failed my
[1:57:58] family I know I most certainly have done
[1:58:00] that and it's it's not out of a sense of
[1:58:03] Pride or arrogance that I would
[1:58:06] challenge you to do better it's out of
[1:58:08] my own experience that I would say to
[1:58:11] you we cannot we cannot win the
[1:58:14] neighborhood at the cost
[1:58:18] all right
[1:58:21] reach one yes we need they need us
[1:58:27] they need us
[1:58:29] I I tell you when I when I first got
[1:58:32] married I came from the Holiness thought
[1:58:34] of of really no birth control under any
[1:58:37] circumstances and that's going to get
[1:58:39] very quiet now
[1:58:42] we were almost Catholic you know
[1:58:47] and so it was no big surprise
[1:58:50] that Benjamin came along almost nine
[1:58:52] months after we right at excuse me not
[1:58:54] almost
[1:59:04] we were married in November he was born
[1:59:06] in August
[1:59:08] so it was nine months
[1:59:11] no wonder it was
[1:59:14] because we weren't doing anything to
[1:59:16] prevent it
[1:59:18] and and I think that was a good plan I'm
[1:59:20] not I'm not I don't regret
[1:59:24] that's how we live the earlier part of
[1:59:26] our life
[1:59:29] brother Branham said these things should
[1:59:31] be taken in a personal interview
[1:59:35] oh
[1:59:36] meaning this shouldn't be a Doctrine for
[1:59:39] the whole church
[1:59:41] isn't that interesting
[1:59:42] because there are different
[1:59:43] circumstances
[1:59:46] I believe that there are people on this
[1:59:48] planet that one child is all they really
[1:59:52] need to pour their life into
[1:59:54] but I believe there are others that have
[1:59:56] got so much love to give so much time
[1:59:59] and more money than they know what to do
[2:00:00] with
[2:00:04] and they ought to have a dozen or more
[2:00:06] I'm not against how they do it but here
[2:00:09] is the revelation that I came to
[2:00:11] a man and a woman do not need to have
[2:00:14] any more children
[2:00:16] than what they can afford to take care
[2:00:18] of
[2:00:23] you never say man
[2:00:25] it's a truth because it's not my place
[2:00:30] to take care of your children
[2:00:32] it's your responsibility to take care of
[2:00:34] your children and wait a minute I didn't
[2:00:36] just mean provide for their doctor bills
[2:00:39] or buy their toothbrushes
[2:00:41] or to put shoes on their feet I mean can
[2:00:44] you afford to commit
[2:00:46] to the spiritual responsibility of
[2:00:50] discipling their life
[2:00:52] because they don't raise ourselves
[2:00:54] children will raise ourselves they've
[2:00:57] got to have strong leadership in the
[2:00:58] family
[2:00:59] they've got to have a daddy that gets on
[2:01:01] his knees they've got to have a Daddy
[2:01:04] who prays Mama's prayers are wonderful
[2:01:07] but not enough
[2:01:11] Mama's not the only one to tell a Bible
[2:01:13] story Daddy's got to have that he's got
[2:01:16] to have a place
[2:01:17] I believe they should share in the
[2:01:19] discipline I don't believe that mothers
[2:01:21] ought to threaten their children when
[2:01:22] Daddy gets home
[2:01:24] [Music]
[2:01:26] I think Mother's got to straighten up
[2:01:28] Bill strong sometime too
[2:01:31] I don't believe a mother needs to do any
[2:01:33] I didn't mean to get on this
[2:01:35] I don't believe a mother needs to do
[2:01:36] anything that puts something in their
[2:01:39] children's heart that causes them to be
[2:01:41] afraid of when Daddy gets home
[2:01:44] they ought to run to the door they ought
[2:01:46] to be so excited to see Daddy they can
[2:01:48] hardly stand it
[2:01:49] are you with me
[2:01:51] because they need that they've got to
[2:01:54] trust him they've got to learn listen
[2:01:56] they learn it when when these brothers
[2:01:59] throw their children up in the air
[2:02:04] I used to be that guy
[2:02:06] but from where I am now
[2:02:13] what's wrong with you
[2:02:15] I lose my breath sometimes watching
[2:02:17] these people throw their kids up in the
[2:02:19] air but did you know that's vital
[2:02:24] did you know that's an important part of
[2:02:26] that Bond
[2:02:27] did you know that child learns
[2:02:30] they may Scream the first time I don't
[2:02:32] mean try to be a clown and throw them up
[2:02:34] on the roof of the church
[2:02:39] they learn that Daddy's going to catch
[2:02:42] them
[2:02:43] yeah you understand Mama the same she
[2:02:45] talks
[2:02:46] [Music]
[2:02:51] and we need to do that in our Christian
[2:02:54] families we need to teach our children
[2:02:56] that they can trust us that we're going
[2:02:59] to be there they are not at the mercy of
[2:03:01] this world they're not at the mercy of
[2:03:03] welfare they're not in the mercy of the
[2:03:05] government they are our responsibility
[2:03:09] and we want to be there for them and we
[2:03:11] want to be present for them
[2:03:15] it's it's a relationship that I believe
[2:03:18] Isaac and Abraham had I believe that
[2:03:21] regardless of how old he was he trusted
[2:03:23] the relationship that Abraham had with
[2:03:25] God and he trusted the relationship that
[2:03:28] Abraham and he had together he could
[2:03:30] trust his dad that everything is going
[2:03:32] to be all right and so when he when he
[2:03:35] said okay son hold still put your hands
[2:03:37] maybe right here and your feet here and
[2:03:39] lay down and daddy is going to tie you
[2:03:41] up
[2:03:43] we do not hear another utterance
[2:03:51] out of Isaac's mouth
[2:03:55] he just obeys he is at peace so having
[2:03:58] the faith of Abraham folks is not just
[2:04:01] calling those things that are not as
[2:04:03] though they are or they were but having
[2:04:05] the faith of Abraham is also the grace
[2:04:07] to be obedient
[2:04:09] to the word of God you are not an
[2:04:12] exception I don't know who I'm preaching
[2:04:13] to tonight but you are not an exception
[2:04:16] you have to live by this word
[2:04:19] and you know what is not a dread it's a
[2:04:22] joy
[2:04:24] this is the life I want to live
[2:04:29] I want you all to know I drink all the
[2:04:31] alcohol I want to drink
[2:04:37] I smoke all the cigarettes and pop all
[2:04:40] the pills
[2:04:41] hello streamers
[2:04:45] I run with all the girlfriends
[2:04:48] that I want to run with
[2:04:53] that's my relationship with him
[2:04:56] I'm living the life I want to live I
[2:05:00] don't want those things I don't need
[2:05:02] those things somebody said yeah but
[2:05:04] you're you're different let me tell you
[2:05:05] something this is what the Lord can do
[2:05:08] in your life this is the freedom we were
[2:05:10] singing about
[2:05:11] this is the freedom I'm not bound by
[2:05:14] Church rules I live the life I live
[2:05:17] because it's his life
[2:05:19] it's obedience and surrender to the will
[2:05:22] of my heavenly father nobody is forcing
[2:05:25] this life on me
[2:05:27] he is making me live like this I choose
[2:05:30] to live this life because I know that my
[2:05:34] father can be trusted
[2:05:39] I didn't have an Earthly father to trust
[2:05:43] I feel so many times like I had no
[2:05:46] father but God
[2:05:47] but could you ask for any more perfect
[2:05:49] example
[2:05:52] than our God
[2:05:53] next verse I gotta hurry it's time to go
[2:05:56] home now and then
[2:06:00] and Abraham stretched forth his hand and
[2:06:02] took the knife to slay his son
[2:06:05] I don't really believe it was that way I
[2:06:07] do
[2:06:08] I really do I believe Abraham really
[2:06:10] trusted God I'm not trying to preach for
[2:06:12] the greatest message I know that he did
[2:06:15] a section of his sermon on Abraham not
[2:06:17] too long ago
[2:06:20] while I was away I heard it was
[2:06:21] wonderful
[2:06:25] he made a statement something like this
[2:06:27] I don't know if Abraham knew
[2:06:29] well I want to tell you something he
[2:06:31] knew
[2:06:32] he knew
[2:06:34] the scripture is if you really look at
[2:06:37] the scripture you understand that he
[2:06:39] knew
[2:06:41] that he was a forerunner
[2:06:43] he was he was he was a type
[2:06:48] something that was going to follow that
[2:06:49] was going to be much greater
[2:06:52] you see God was about to come down and
[2:06:54] replace a life with a life
[2:06:56] all right
[2:06:58] he was going to show what it means to
[2:07:01] take a life and replace it with another
[2:07:03] life
[2:07:05] so that we could see and where was he
[2:07:07] going to do it right there
[2:07:09] folks it's not by happenstance
[2:07:13] that Calvary is a part of the same
[2:07:15] Mountain that Moriah is
[2:07:18] it's not by happenstance that Abraham
[2:07:20] put put Isaac up on an altar on the very
[2:07:22] Rock the very Mountain
[2:07:24] where Jesus hung and died
[2:07:26] for another son come on now
[2:07:30] let's read on just a minute stretch
[2:07:31] forth his hand and the angel of the Lord
[2:07:34] the angel of the Lord called out
[2:07:42] boy that's heavy
[2:07:45] oh dear
[2:07:48] can you see this
[2:07:53] you folks jittery
[2:08:01] I met the artist who did that he was a
[2:08:03] very kind man
[2:08:05] he's also the one who did the eagle
[2:08:08] and the and the
[2:08:09] on the world with the sword in his mouth
[2:08:12] a Jewish artist
[2:08:17] the angel of the Lord called unto him
[2:08:19] out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham
[2:08:22] and how did he answer
[2:08:25] Ed the same way he answered his son
[2:08:28] here am I
[2:08:30] I'm here Lord
[2:08:32] and the angel said lay not that hand
[2:08:34] upon the lad
[2:08:36] neither do thou anything unto him
[2:08:40] for now I know that thou feirest God
[2:08:43] seeing thou Hast not withheld thy son
[2:08:45] thine only son from me
[2:08:50] let's read on
[2:08:52] Abraham what did he do
[2:08:58] verses before the Bible said he lived it
[2:09:00] up his eyes and saw the place
[2:09:06] which in Hebrew is
[2:09:11] excuse me
[2:09:13] he lifted up his eyes and he saw the
[2:09:16] place now he did it again so this is a
[2:09:19] spiritual thing
[2:09:21] this is when you when you when you
[2:09:24] forget for a moment where you are
[2:09:27] and what you're going through and you
[2:09:30] choose to look up to him
[2:09:33] and Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[2:09:36] looked and behold behind him
[2:09:41] now that phrase in the Hebrew behind him
[2:09:44] doesn't mean in the past
[2:09:48] the Greek translators chose
[2:09:51] behind him but in Hebrew it doesn't say
[2:09:54] in the past
[2:09:56] or behind him guess what it says in the
[2:09:58] Hebrew
[2:09:59] it says in the future
[2:10:08] looked and behold behind him a ram
[2:10:11] he looked in the future
[2:10:16] he looked in the future and saw a ram
[2:10:24] not in the past in the future
[2:10:28] did you all see just a minute ago how
[2:10:30] she had the words up and the picture was
[2:10:33] behind it we call that sometime
[2:10:36] superimposed
[2:10:39] this is the vision that Abraham had that
[2:10:41] day on the mountain he saw something in
[2:10:44] the spirit that was superimposed he saw
[2:10:47] a ram whose horn was caught in the
[2:10:50] fishing but he also saw something else
[2:10:53] he saw the place
[2:10:56] and the place is harmock home it means
[2:10:59] the city of God it means the Gateway of
[2:11:03] the Kingdom
[2:11:05] so Abraham wasn't just seeing his
[2:11:08] present he was seeing the future
[2:11:12] superimposed over the present
[2:11:15] he saw Jesus
[2:11:19] are you are you confident enough to say
[2:11:22] that yes I am he saw Jesus
[2:11:25] never born
[2:11:28] bethlehem's babe had never been born
[2:11:32] and yet Abraham caught a revelation let
[2:11:35] me tell you something when you can catch
[2:11:37] a revelation in the midst of all this
[2:11:40] adverse circumstance and you can catch a
[2:11:42] glimpse that everything I got a feeling
[2:11:46] everything's gonna be all right oh I've
[2:11:51] got a feeling
[2:11:53] everything's gonna be all right
[2:11:56] I've Got a Feeling
[2:11:59] everything's gonna be all right be all
[2:12:02] right be all right be all right
[2:12:07] I am
[2:12:14] I got a feeling
[2:12:16] but it's more than a feeling it's a
[2:12:18] feeling that comes from a revelation
[2:12:21] that what I'm seeing right now is
[2:12:24] pointing to something
[2:12:26] when I stood here last Sunday and talked
[2:12:28] about those five those five planets
[2:12:32] lining up
[2:12:33] I was not aware of this quote
[2:12:37] how much time do I have
[2:12:43] I know you're tired you can stand up and
[2:12:45] do jumping jacks and then sit back down
[2:12:46] if you if you need to I wouldn't care
[2:12:50] I really wouldn't care
[2:12:54] I read this to some of the brothers
[2:12:56] today because it's sometimes so hard to
[2:12:58] find some of these things
[2:13:00] we've got all these search engines and
[2:13:02] everything and it's still hard to find
[2:13:04] some because brother Brandon can say it
[2:13:06] so many different ways
[2:13:09] I didn't get to be in the services but
[2:13:10] if I would have been there I would have
[2:13:12] done my best
[2:13:14] to have kept him on track a time or two
[2:13:20] somebody said that's a Blasphemous thing
[2:13:22] to say no
[2:13:24] but I mean to be so fearful that you
[2:13:26] couldn't even help him when he was
[2:13:28] saying given the wrong scripture
[2:13:30] you think somebody I don't know how
[2:13:32] those women if if not the men I don't
[2:13:35] know how the women kept quiet
[2:13:39] I am two Sister George because I know
[2:13:41] you and I know you would have wanted to
[2:13:43] help him that's nothing wrong and you'd
[2:13:45] have wanted to say was that so-and-so
[2:13:51] because
[2:13:54] he said it I just jumped right on it
[2:14:01] because he talks here now on some very
[2:14:03] powerful things and he's calling them
[2:14:05] five stars instead of planets
[2:14:09] and so if you search for five planets
[2:14:11] you won't even find this quote so I came
[2:14:14] here with the court I had but but look
[2:14:16] at what I what I got
[2:14:19] I won't tell how I got it
[2:14:23] but it came from another Pastor in the
[2:14:25] message
[2:14:26] who happened to be streaming our service
[2:14:29] and probably wouldn't want the world to
[2:14:31] know it
[2:14:33] and he sent this through to the family
[2:14:35] through into me I mean I got it because
[2:14:38] he sent it to the family it's from the
[2:14:40] message the end times sign seed
[2:14:43] in 1962 March the 19th
[2:14:46] he said now what's happened
[2:14:48] we see a roar in the paper across the
[2:14:52] television out across the Nations where
[2:14:54] five stars just fell in line with the
[2:14:56] world
[2:14:58] he goes on now and talks for 10 minutes
[2:15:01] about
[2:15:04] it's aligning I know that
[2:15:07] that Pippin you can look it up and see
[2:15:09] that this was absolutely with the timing
[2:15:13] of the five planets that lined up just
[2:15:15] like they're lined up right now
[2:15:18] we're not at the peak anymore but
[2:15:19] they're still in alignment just after
[2:15:21] Sunset five planets lined up with the
[2:15:24] moon and and the Earth in a 50 degree uh
[2:15:28] sector or section of space
[2:15:31] he said we're five stars just fell in
[2:15:33] line with the world what's five a number
[2:15:35] of Grace every time those stars come in
[2:15:39] to me this is significant to hear
[2:15:42] every time those stars come in
[2:15:46] something happens on Earth
[2:15:50] he said what taken place five stars fell
[2:15:53] in what was it
[2:15:55] and introducing of what
[2:16:00] he said since then look just what's
[2:16:02] taken place Germany almost washed off
[2:16:05] the map
[2:16:07] some of the Magi said that the world
[2:16:09] would burst like a watermelon that was
[2:16:11] the Indian astronomers astrologist
[2:16:14] he said every distressful thing is
[2:16:16] prophesied by them for the last days
[2:16:22] look what's taken place England the
[2:16:24] other day had a storm that blowed away
[2:16:26] seventy thousand houses in one day
[2:16:30] disasters everywhere California Los
[2:16:32] Angeles nearly washed in the ocean
[2:16:35] what is it the beginning of Sorrows
[2:16:37] earthquakes has picked up everywhere why
[2:16:40] is it five stars come in lineman
[2:16:43] Grace God's grace what's happened an
[2:16:46] infant Church listen listen that's the
[2:16:48] natural
[2:16:49] he's telling us that when these things
[2:16:51] line up that way it affects things in
[2:16:53] the natural seventy thousand homes
[2:16:55] destroyed in a storm Germany flooded
[2:16:59] almost washed off into the ocean Los
[2:17:02] Angeles flooding almost washed off into

[2:17:35] Trinity becoming one on earth Among Us
[2:17:37] God's offices becoming one office what
[2:17:40] happened now it's the Church of the
[2:17:42] Living God coming together under the
[2:17:45] word of God let it be so Lord
[2:17:47] and the astronomic heaven or astronomic
[2:17:51] Heaven is announcing her approach amen
[2:17:54] he said might not believe that but it's
[2:17:56] the word just the same yes sir what's
[2:17:58] happening I'm closing I might say this
[2:18:00] friends the church is coming forth
[2:18:03] God's going to have a church without
[2:18:05] spot or wrinkle she's predestinated God
[2:18:08] said so he would have it that makes it
[2:18:11] right who's a member I don't know I'm
[2:18:13] trusting it to be myself I'm trusting
[2:18:15] you I'll remember but he's going to have
[2:18:17] a body without spot or wrinkle so
[2:18:20] brother Branham in this quotation he
[2:18:22] draws the spiritual connection as well
[2:18:24] as the natural connection and he tells
[2:18:26] us that as things begin to happen
[2:18:28] naturally on the earth when these he
[2:18:30] says Stars here but planets align
[2:18:34] then he said also this spiritual this is
[2:18:37] the spiritual side that's the church
[2:18:39] coming up that's the bride being formed
[2:18:41] for her bridegroom now here we are again
[2:18:47] about to enter into Passover time
[2:18:52] I didn't say Easter Bunny time
[2:18:59] or or Easter bonnet time
[2:19:02] or what time is the Easter egg hunt
[2:19:04] going to be at the church
[2:19:11] that's a mockery
[2:19:14] wait a minute Amen brother
[2:19:20] let's read on here just a minute I've
[2:19:22] got to close
[2:19:24] where were we at up there
[2:19:26] these people have driven all day and
[2:19:28] night in their War now and I'm wearing
[2:19:30] them out and then I'm not even going to
[2:19:32] give them supper
[2:19:35] you make it to lunch tomorrow we'll feed
[2:19:36] you again
[2:19:38] and Abraham called the name of that
[2:19:40] place Jehovah Jehovah Jireh yeah
[2:19:47] as it is said to this day in the Mount
[2:19:50] of the Lord
[2:19:54] in the Mount of the Lord it shall be
[2:19:57] seen in the Mount of the Lord it shall
[2:20:00] be seen in Moriah it shall be seen come
[2:20:03] on
[2:20:05] he named it based on what he had
[2:20:08] experienced
[2:20:11] this is more than God providing around
[2:20:13] that day this is God providing a ram on
[2:20:17] another day
[2:20:18] a lamb without spot and without
[2:20:21] recalling without blemish
[2:20:25] you know what today is the 10th of
[2:20:27] Nissan or the tenth of Habib do you know
[2:20:29] what would be happening today
[2:20:31] or son has sat so we're going into the
[2:20:33] 11th
[2:20:35] but the sun is set Jesus arrived in
[2:20:37] Bethany today
[2:20:41] he's visiting in the home of Mary and
[2:20:43] Martha in Lazarus
[2:20:45] on this day
[2:20:47] Six Days on the 31st six days before
[2:20:51] Passover five days now before the
[2:20:53] Passover begins
[2:20:59] does anybody remember anything about
[2:21:01] that night
[2:21:04] we can't talk about it right now
[2:21:09] I've got to read on
[2:21:11] give me another verse I'll get to it in
[2:21:13] a minute maybe
[2:21:15] no that's all my verses there isn't it
[2:21:19] now in in in Hebrew this whole chapter
[2:21:22] of of Genesis chapter 22 is called the
[2:21:25] Akida
[2:21:27] and it means The Binding
[2:21:30] it's one of the most important
[2:21:32] scriptures in Judaism
[2:21:36] there are so many Messianic elements
[2:21:41] to this story
[2:21:43] pointing to the Future
[2:21:47] let me give you a confirmation if
[2:21:49] someone needs a confirmation would you
[2:21:51] give me John chapter 8.
[2:21:54] verse 51 do I have a few more minutes
[2:21:57] verily verily I say unto you if this is
[2:22:00] Jesus talking red letter
[2:22:03] if a man keep my saying he shall never
[2:22:06] see death
[2:22:08] then said the Jews unto him now we know
[2:22:10] that thou Hast the devil
[2:22:12] Abraham is dead
[2:22:15] and the prophets and thou sayest if a
[2:22:18] man keep my saying he shall never taste
[2:22:21] of death
[2:22:22] art thou greater than our Father Abraham
[2:22:25] which is dead and the prophets are dead
[2:22:28] who make us thou thyself who are you
[2:22:32] in Jesus answer if I honor myself my
[2:22:35] honor is nothing it is my father that
[2:22:37] honoreth me of whom you say that he is
[2:22:40] your god I tell you that's powerful talk
[2:22:43] isn't it yet ye have not known him but I
[2:22:46] know him and if I should say I know him
[2:22:49] not I shall be a liar like you
[2:22:54] but I know him and keep his saying
[2:22:58] your father Abraham
[2:23:08] you see
[2:23:10] he wasn't just looking at a ram in a
[2:23:12] bush
[2:23:14] he lifted up his eyes and he saw the
[2:23:16] place he lifted up his eyes and he saw
[2:23:20] the sacrifice and Abraham went down that
[2:23:23] mountain with more faith that he had
[2:23:25] when he went up that mountain he said I
[2:23:27] may never live to see it with my with my
[2:23:30] natural eyes but today I have seen the
[2:23:33] Lord
[2:23:33] [Applause]
[2:23:35] I have seen the Lord's salvation I have
[2:23:39] seen Jehovah Yara the God who provides
[2:23:44] he not only meets our physical needs but
[2:23:47] he met our need for Redemption
[2:23:55] your father Abraham rejoiced
[2:23:58] to see my day he saw it and was glad
[2:24:01] don't you believe that's New Testament
[2:24:03] confirmation or what I was preaching you
[2:24:04] in a moment ago then said the Jews unto
[2:24:06] him Thou Art not yet 50 years old and
[2:24:09] hast thou seen Abraham
[2:24:11] didn't say he saw Abraham said Abraham
[2:24:14] saw him
[2:24:15] right
[2:24:17] Jesus said unto them verily verily I say
[2:24:20] unto you
[2:24:23] before Abraham was
[2:24:27] get your tenses right
[2:24:30] he didn't say I was the I was did he
[2:24:34] I will be the will be
[2:24:36] I am that I am
[2:24:41] he said before Abraham go back
[2:24:44] before Abraham was
[2:24:47] I am
[2:24:49] this blows their mind
[2:24:51] they don't know what to think then took
[2:24:52] they up stones to cast in him but Jesus
[2:24:55] hid himself and went out of the temple
[2:24:57] going through the midst of them and so
[2:24:59] passed by I'll take you to the to the
[2:25:01] precipice
[2:25:03] overlooking from the city of
[2:25:06] of Nazareth
[2:25:09] where they pushed him down toward the
[2:25:11] crowd toward the the edge of the the
[2:25:13] precipice of the cliff and they were
[2:25:15] going to push him off the cliff
[2:25:17] because he said to them before Abraham
[2:25:19] was I am because he said Abraham
[2:25:22] rejoiced to see my day he saw it and was
[2:25:24] glad
[2:25:25] they were going to they call this
[2:25:27] blasphemy and they were going to push
[2:25:28] him off and you know what God just made
[2:25:30] a way like like some of you saw
[2:25:32] portrayed in the chosen God just made a
[2:25:34] way where there was no way that that
[2:25:35] here there said we're we're here to push
[2:25:37] you off and instead they just
[2:25:40] and he walks right through what the
[2:25:41] Bible say through the midst of them so
[2:25:43] passed by
[2:25:46] look what he did
[2:25:48] what did Abraham see quickly
[2:25:51] what took place on Mount Moriah
[2:25:53] Abraham was instructed by God to take
[2:25:56] Isaac to Mount Moriah and sacrifice him
[2:25:58] there did you know that first and the
[2:26:00] second temple would be built right on
[2:26:03] top of the same Hill
[2:26:06] so when we have our picture up
[2:26:09] you see Abraham seeing the Holy Temple
[2:26:16] when you are in Jerusalem if you go into
[2:26:19] the mosque of Omar
[2:26:22] if you go into the golden dome
[2:26:28] call it the abomination of desolation
[2:26:32] but it wasn't originally that
[2:26:35] it's now a holy place for Muslims and
[2:26:38] sometimes they don't even let
[2:26:40] non-muslims go in but in 1979 when I was
[2:26:44] 11 years old I went in and saw the rock
[2:26:46] I should have got a picture
[2:26:49] I'd love to I'd love it could somebody
[2:26:51] find us a picture of the inside of the
[2:26:54] Dome of the Rock put in something like
[2:26:56] that the stone
[2:26:58] or the rock inside the Dome of the Rock
[2:27:01] and there should be a picture taken from
[2:27:04] the top of the Dome looking down over
[2:27:06] the Rock
[2:27:08] the place where the Holy Temple sat
[2:27:10] right there on the mountain is the is
[2:27:13] the very place where Abraham was laid up
[2:27:16] on this altar on the Rock to be
[2:27:18] sacrificed so powerful things were going
[2:27:21] to follow
[2:27:23] God was there it is
[2:27:25] how many of you have ever seen that
[2:27:27] picture any of you
[2:27:28] that's looking down on the very Bedrock
[2:27:31] of the top of Mount Moriah
[2:27:35] so somewhere on that slab of Iraq the
[2:27:38] altar would have been built that Isaac
[2:27:41] was laid on top of
[2:27:43] hundreds of years later the first temple
[2:27:46] would be built and the second temple
[2:27:48] would be built
[2:27:51] just off the
[2:27:53] of that same escarpment of stone
[2:27:59] no longer connected today
[2:28:03] Suleiman the Magnificent blasted out a
[2:28:07] piece of of the Mountain of Moriah
[2:28:11] so that Calvary now sits on one side of
[2:28:14] the road and the Temple mount on the
[2:28:16] other side of the road
[2:28:18] but you can stand on the walls of
[2:28:20] Jerusalem and look out look on top of
[2:28:23] the walls and look out and see Calvary
[2:28:25] and you can clearly see that at one
[2:28:28] point it's the very same rock where
[2:28:30] Abraham was going to sacrifice Vice
[2:28:32] Isaac it's the same rock where the first
[2:28:35] temple was built the same rock where the
[2:28:37] second temple was built and the same
[2:28:39] rock where our Lord was crucified
[2:28:45] this is what Abraham saw
[2:28:48] in second Chronicles chapter 3 verse 1
[2:28:50] then Solomon began to build the house of
[2:28:53] the Lord in Jerusalem in Mount Moriah
[2:28:55] where the Lord appeared unto David his
[2:28:57] father in the place that David had
[2:28:59] prepared in the threshing floor of ornam
[2:29:02] the jebusite
[2:29:05] so here was another happening that took
[2:29:08] place right here on the mountain it was
[2:29:10] in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah where Jesus
[2:29:12] was crucified on the tree so I want you
[2:29:15] to imagine for me just just a moment in
[2:29:18] closing
[2:29:19] I want you to imagine another son
[2:29:23] carrying a piece of wood
[2:29:29] I can almost guarantee you it didn't
[2:29:32] look like a Catholic cross
[2:29:38] I can almost guarantee you that he was
[2:29:41] only caught carrying the crossbar
[2:29:46] and it wasn't a two by four
[2:29:48] it was a log
[2:29:53] I know the picture show the the whole
[2:29:56] cross but this was this didn't happen
[2:29:59] in that time period
[2:30:02] they tied them to the crossbar
[2:30:05] and they hung them on the execution
[2:30:07] stake
[2:30:09] and the execution state was like a tree
[2:30:15] and When They Carried their crossbar all
[2:30:18] the way up to the top of the hill then
[2:30:19] they attached the crossbar to the
[2:30:22] execution stake
[2:30:24] and this is how Roman crucifixion took
[2:30:26] place somebody said why does that matter
[2:30:28] it matters because you would be
[2:30:30] surprised what the Catholic church has
[2:30:32] done to change our image
[2:30:37] uh
[2:30:42] there were no altars in the in the early
[2:30:44] church
[2:30:47] those people even knew then that the
[2:30:49] altar was the heart
[2:30:52] there's so much Church entity that gets
[2:30:54] into our our this whole Easter thing
[2:31:00] so religious we make it
[2:31:03] hot cross buns
[2:31:06] ham
[2:31:10] can you imagine Easter ham
[2:31:18] such tradition not understanding that
[2:31:21] it's not just simple little tradition
[2:31:23] it's rooted
[2:31:25] in things that are against Christ
[2:31:29] paganism
[2:31:31] dressing your little children up
[2:31:33] somebody said I'm so glad I got out from
[2:31:34] under the Amish or I'm so glad I got out
[2:31:37] from under that group or the other group
[2:31:38] so now I can give my children Easter
[2:31:41] bunnies
[2:31:44] you think the Lord delivered you out of
[2:31:46] that system so he could put you in one
[2:31:48] map
[2:31:51] map Easter has absolutely nothing to do
[2:31:53] with the resurrection
[2:31:56] you hear about the brand I'm talking
[2:31:57] about Easter and every place that you
[2:31:59] hear him say Easter you could easily
[2:32:02] easily replace that with the word
[2:32:04] resurrection and the resurrection is not
[2:32:06] a day
[2:32:10] we celebrate Resurrection every day can
[2:32:13] I get some help
[2:32:14] you're afraid I'm going to preach
[2:32:15] another hour I might
[2:32:19] the resurrection is not a day what is
[2:32:21] the resurrection it's a person
[2:32:23] Jesus said I am the resurrection
[2:32:26] you don't have to wear no Easter bonnet
[2:32:28] for me you don't have to give your
[2:32:30] children diet eggs for me I don't want
[2:32:32] the goddess of fertility mentioned in
[2:32:34] mind
[2:32:36] [Music]
[2:32:38] you know why they eat the ham don't you
[2:32:42] because Nimrod was killed by a wild boar
[2:32:49] and so they celebrate and have since
[2:32:51] Pagan days they celebrate by eating ham
[2:32:55] on Easter Sunday
[2:32:58] because Nimrod was killed by a wild boar
[2:33:04] they believe that a that a bunny
[2:33:07] laid an egg
[2:33:13] just silliness isn't it does anybody
[2:33:15] know anything about rabbits
[2:33:17] they don't lay eggs
[2:33:20] and they're not pink and purple and
[2:33:22] polka dotted when if it did
[2:33:26] somebody tell me what that's got to do
[2:33:28] with the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[2:33:30] it's got about as much to do with it as
[2:33:33] a Christmas tree has to do with
[2:33:35] Christmas
[2:33:38] foreign
[2:33:39] just a minute Amen brother tell it
[2:33:46] you don't have to be popular but you've
[2:33:48] got to tell the truth
[2:33:50] because we're going to answer to God for
[2:33:52] these things one of these days
[2:33:55] [Music]
[2:34:00] for the kitties if it's for the kitties
[2:34:02] it's for the kitties
[2:34:04] you get them in a good atmosphere and
[2:34:06] teach them how to Worship the Lord
[2:34:08] you teach them how to put God first you
[2:34:10] mamas and daddies learn how to disciple
[2:34:12] your own children you want to do
[2:34:14] something for them they don't need the
[2:34:15] Easter basket
[2:34:19] you give them give them big to them and
[2:34:22] and treat them and and celebrate with
[2:34:25] them and and there's nothing wrong with
[2:34:27] that
[2:34:28] but don't reduce the holy things of God
[2:34:31] to the paganism of this old world and
[2:34:34] dress it up and try to call it religious
[2:34:36] because brother Branham preached a
[2:34:37] sermon on the true Easter seal so
[2:34:39] somebody said well there couldn't have
[2:34:40] been nothing wrong with Easter or he
[2:34:42] wouldn't have said that he's talking to
[2:34:43] the people in a language they can
[2:34:45] understand I thank God I can understand
[2:34:47] a different language than that today
[2:34:54] well that went over like a rat sandwich
[2:35:07] Hebrews 11 I'm going to close I didn't
[2:35:09] even get to mine
[2:35:11] to my subject
[2:35:16] verse 17 by faith Abraham when he was
[2:35:18] tried offered up Isaac and he that had
[2:35:21] received the promise offered up his only
[2:35:23] begotten son
[2:35:24] of whom it was said that in Isaac shall
[2:35:27] thy seed be called accounting that God
[2:35:29] was able to raise him up even from the
[2:35:31] dead from whence also he received him in
[2:35:33] a figure I wasn't making it up
[2:35:36] it's in the book
[2:35:39] he was seeing into the future
[2:35:42] he was seeing harmacombe
[2:35:44] in Jeremiah 17 12 if you're making notes
[2:35:47] in Jeremiah 17 12 harmonicom is used in
[2:35:50] Hebrew as the Glorious Throne of God in
[2:35:53] the place of his sanctuary
[2:35:55] and in Genesis 28 17 that same phrase
[2:35:57] harmonic home is used as the gate it's a
[2:36:00] place where Jacob woke up
[2:36:03] and said surely the Lord is in this
[2:36:05] place
[2:36:06] this is none other but the house of God
[2:36:08] and this is the Gate of Heaven Genesis
[2:36:11] 28 17.
[2:36:23] I'm going to do this I'm going to take
[2:36:25] Liberty
[2:36:27] go to John 12 just a moment
[2:36:33] if I were sitting where you are I'd be
[2:36:35] wishing the preacher was done
[2:36:39] so I don't judge you at all
[2:36:55] people sit in front of a football game
[2:36:59] that goes on for eternity
[2:37:03] of course the reason why it takes so
[2:37:05] long is to keep falling down
[2:37:09] if they get up and get it over with it
[2:37:10] could all be done in 20 minutes
[2:37:13] people said all night for basketball
[2:37:14] goes into overtime
[2:37:17] they love these overtime games go on and
[2:37:20] on and on and on and on and on and on
[2:37:22] and on and on and on and on hoping for a
[2:37:24] different outcome
[2:37:26] and they don't want to give God even a
[2:37:28] whole hour
[2:37:30] if you worship longer than 20 minutes
[2:37:32] say thank you you're really abusing
[2:37:35] people
[2:37:36] then Jesus listen then Jesus six days
[2:37:39] before the Passover that would have been
[2:37:40] on the 10th which was today
[2:37:44] six days before the Passover came to
[2:37:46] Bethany where Lazarus was with where
[2:37:48] last was which excuse me what switch had
[2:37:50] been dead
[2:37:52] whom he raised from the dead
[2:37:54] there they made him a supper and Martha
[2:37:57] served but Lazarus was one of them that
[2:37:59] sat at the table with him
[2:38:02] then took Mary
[2:38:09] a pound of ointment of spikenerd
[2:38:13] very costly
[2:38:16] and anointed the feet of Jesus
[2:38:19] and wiped his feet with her hair
[2:38:24] and I've often said if the modern
[2:38:26] Pentecostal Church decided to worship
[2:38:28] this way they would beat themselves to
[2:38:30] death with their bobbed hair
[2:38:32] foreign
[2:38:35] but here a woman had long enough hair
[2:38:38] that she could wipe his feet with her
[2:38:41] hair
[2:38:42] I I can't imagine what people would say
[2:38:48] this wild woman this loose acting woman
[2:38:51] how dare her
[2:38:55] now this may have happened more than one
[2:38:57] time
[2:38:59] this anointing Jesus for burial
[2:39:02] but we know exactly where this happened
[2:39:04] it happened in Bethany
[2:39:07] not in the house of Simon not this one
[2:39:10] this happened in the house of Lazarus
[2:39:12] and Martha and Mary
[2:39:14] and it was Mary who took a pound of
[2:39:17] ointment of Spite and are very costly an
[2:39:19] anointed defeat of Jesus and wiped his
[2:39:21] feet with her hair and the house was
[2:39:23] filled with the order of the ointment
[2:39:25] then saith one of his disciples guess
[2:39:27] who it was
[2:39:29] Judas Iscariot Simon's son which should
[2:39:32] betray him
[2:39:33] why was not this ointment sold for 300
[2:39:36] Pence and given to the poor
[2:39:41] imagine the religiousness
[2:39:46] how religious
[2:39:48] it sounded so religious
[2:39:52] what kind of church would have padded
[2:39:54] pews I remember that
[2:39:58] what kind of church would have carpet on
[2:40:00] the floor I remember those days
[2:40:03] what kind of church would have indoor
[2:40:05] plumbing I remember when they said
[2:40:06] things like that
[2:40:08] religious
[2:40:12] not spiritual
[2:40:14] Judas wasn't being spiritual he couldn't
[2:40:17] care less about the poor
[2:40:21] he was manifesting his seed
[2:40:25] then he said not that he cared for the
[2:40:26] poor but because he was
[2:40:31] and had the bag
[2:40:33] and bear what was put therein
[2:40:36] then said Jesus let her alone against
[2:40:38] the day of my burying had she kept this
[2:40:42] she knows something you Fellers don't
[2:40:44] seem to know
[2:40:46] for the poor always you have with you
[2:40:48] but me you have not always
[2:40:51] much people of the Jews therefore knew
[2:40:53] that he was there and they came not for
[2:40:55] Jesus sake only but that they might see
[2:40:57] Lazarus also whom he had raised from the
[2:41:00] dead but the chief priest consulted that
[2:41:02] they might put Lazarus also to death
[2:41:05] because that by reason of him many of
[2:41:07] the Jews went away and believed on Jesus
[2:41:09] can you imagine
[2:41:12] that a man is raised from the dead and
[2:41:14] the religious are going to kill him
[2:41:17] because he testifies that he once was
[2:41:19] dead and now he's alive so look for
[2:41:21] don't you be surprised when somebody has
[2:41:23] something critical to say about you
[2:41:26] they despised a man once dead now raised
[2:41:29] again they're going to despise you if
[2:41:31] you were once bound and now you're free
[2:41:33] if you were once quiet it's a church
[2:41:36] mouse but now you shout the high praises
[2:41:38] of God they're going to criticize you if
[2:41:42] you were once founding and steep by
[2:41:43] religion but now you have a real
[2:41:45] relationship with Jesus Christ they're
[2:41:48] going to criticize you
[2:41:52] six days before the Passover
[2:41:56] this is what the what the organized
[2:41:58] Church calls Holy Week is about to begin
[2:42:02] tomorrow being what the organized Church
[2:42:04] calls Palm Sunday
[2:42:10] not even really understanding the
[2:42:12] fullness
[2:42:13] of what these people were saying
[2:42:18] they were crying out for salvation
[2:42:22] laid their garments down in the palm
[2:42:25] branches in front of him fulfilling the
[2:42:28] Prophecies of the Old Testament as the
[2:42:31] very Lamb of God was riding into the
[2:42:33] town now I'm closing musicians are
[2:42:35] coming quickly
[2:42:40] Martha
[2:42:42] was serving
[2:42:45] Lazarus was fellowshipping at the table
[2:42:52] the religious Jews were standing on the
[2:42:55] outside of the house ready to kill
[2:42:57] Lazarus
[2:43:01] everybody had a purpose
[2:43:04] hear me
[2:43:05] everybody had something that was
[2:43:07] consuming their thought process
[2:43:10] I want somebody to tell me what Mary was
[2:43:12] doing
[2:43:16] what was she doing
[2:43:19] Lazarus chose to sit at the table and
[2:43:21] and fellowship
[2:43:24] Martha chose to serve the table
[2:43:26] it was her nature to be a servant and
[2:43:29] everybody doing something fulfilling
[2:43:32] some purpose
[2:43:34] and what did Mary do
[2:43:38] I'll Tell You Folks it was Passover
[2:43:41] she was choosing her lamb
[2:43:47] it is good
[2:43:49] she was choosing her lamb
[2:43:53] the Lamb of God that taketh away the
[2:43:56] sins of the world
[2:43:59] she took the most prized possession that
[2:44:01] she had
[2:44:03] broke it broke the Box laid pour the
[2:44:07] spotner out on his feet and begins to
[2:44:09] wipe his feet with the hair of her head
[2:44:15] she chose her lamb
[2:44:19] she didn't get caught up in the politics
[2:44:22] that was going on outside the door or
[2:44:24] the religious work
[2:44:26] going on outside the door
[2:44:28] she didn't even get caught up with the
[2:44:29] dishes
[2:44:34] now folks the dishes have got to be
[2:44:36] washed
[2:44:39] but they didn't have to be washed right
[2:44:41] then
[2:44:43] I've traveled all over this country I've
[2:44:46] traveled all over the world I've eaten
[2:44:48] in probably thousands of homes
[2:44:51] you can look at me and tell
[2:44:54] foreign
[2:44:57] I've been in homes where I never saw the
[2:45:00] women
[2:45:03] never saw them
[2:45:04] they they prepared the meal
[2:45:07] and they put the meal on the table and
[2:45:10] they were gone I never saw them again
[2:45:14] I've been in I've been in pastors homes
[2:45:16] where the pastor wouldn't even eat a
[2:45:18] meal with me because he wanted to honor
[2:45:20] me
[2:45:24] I've sat in rooms with my own Companions
[2:45:27] and eaten alone
[2:45:29] and only saw the pastor before the meal
[2:45:32] and after the meal and it was a way of
[2:45:34] it was in their culture a way of showing
[2:45:36] me respect I finally told them this
[2:45:38] respect this is too much
[2:45:41] I'd rather you come in here and eat a
[2:45:43] meal with me
[2:45:44] let's eat together
[2:45:46] and then I would say to him sometime can
[2:45:48] I go back and speak to the sisters and
[2:45:50] thank them for the meal and you you
[2:45:51] think In some cultures I was asking to
[2:45:54] to kill the pet dog or something
[2:45:58] but I want to thank them for the meal
[2:46:01] I like the good food they prepared and I
[2:46:05] enjoyed all the wonderful meals but do
[2:46:06] you know what I enjoyed the most
[2:46:09] was when the sisters would come around
[2:46:11] and they'd say we can wash the dishes
[2:46:14] after you all go we just want to sit
[2:46:16] over here and listen
[2:46:21] see they were choosing their lamb
[2:46:25] there's a time to wash the dishes
[2:46:27] there's a time to put things away
[2:46:29] there's a time to get involved in what's
[2:46:31] going on outside but there is a Time
[2:46:33] folks I don't know what your culture is
[2:46:36] but maybe you ought to adjust it
[2:46:41] that's one thing I know about some of
[2:46:42] these former Amish people Sister Mary
[2:46:47] they don't mind to work
[2:46:50] these are hard-working people they know
[2:46:52] what farm work and hard work is all
[2:46:54] about but I want you to know they love
[2:46:57] to be close enough
[2:47:00] when the men folk are talking about the
[2:47:02] things of the Lord and so far I've not
[2:47:05] seen any of their husbands correct them
[2:47:08] and say now you're going off with the
[2:47:10] women
[2:47:12] because they're so hungry to hear to
[2:47:15] share the testimony not just from me
[2:47:19] I see these people going around to folks
[2:47:21] in the church talking their testimonies
[2:47:24] out this is how we grow
[2:47:26] I I hope I'm not getting myself in
[2:47:28] trouble here
[2:47:30] but the dishes can wait sometime
[2:47:32] sometime we ought to choose our lamb
[2:47:35] we ought to choose what we put our focus
[2:47:37] on brother Mary chose our lamb she said
[2:47:40] I don't care that this is all I got the
[2:47:43] only savings I have after this I have
[2:47:45] nothing of any value the most valuable
[2:47:47] thing in all the world is sitting in my
[2:47:50] living room tonight
[2:47:52] and there's trouble everywhere and
[2:47:54] there's rumors that they're going to
[2:47:55] kill him this is my chance to kneel down
[2:47:59] at his speed
[2:48:01] and pour out my costly perfume
[2:48:06] dry his feet
[2:48:08] the oil off with my hair and let him
[2:48:12] know there's no place I'd rather be
[2:48:14] there's no place I'd rather be there's
[2:48:16] no place I'd rather be than Here In Your
[2:48:19] Love here in your love oh I'd rather be
[2:48:22] right here sitting on the floor
[2:48:24] worshiping the Lord fueling the critics
[2:48:30] because we sung a little louder the drum
[2:48:33] was a little louder the guitar was a
[2:48:35] little loud or somebody kicked up their
[2:48:37] heel or somebody had a little bit of joy
[2:48:41] don't you get caught up in that choose
[2:48:45] your lamb tonight it's Passover time
[2:48:47] it's time to choose our lamb I want to
[2:48:51] choose the one that Abraham saw he saw
[2:48:54] the ram in the thicket but he saw far
[2:48:56] off
[2:49:00] he saw the place
[2:49:03] Jesus
[2:49:05] comes along and confirms it four
[2:49:07] thousand years later Abraham
[2:49:10] he saw
[2:49:12] me
[2:49:14] he saw my day and he rejoice
[2:49:19] in this word wonderful

[2:49:55] it could never feel
[2:49:58] this one bitter cup
[2:50:02] till one spotless lamb in the form of
[2:50:07] man gave his life on Calvary

[2:50:27] not just blood of another spotless

[2:53:06] [Music]
[2:53:08] I choose my love again tonight
[2:53:18] you've not chosen your lamb
[2:53:21] choose him tonight
[2:53:24] the Bible tells us the book of Exodus
[2:53:26] that every man has to have a lamb it's
[2:53:29] Passover time and every man has to have
[2:53:32] a lamb
[2:53:34] you pull him aside right about now
[2:53:38] you examine him
[2:53:40] for four days
[2:53:43] and if you were living in the time of
[2:53:45] Christ
[2:53:46] you would have had to buy you a lamb
[2:53:50] you'd have had to pull him aside and
[2:53:52] look over him with a fine-tooth comb to
[2:53:55] make sure that he was spotless in every
[2:53:56] way
[2:53:58] and then after you've examined him
[2:54:02] three o'clock in the afternoon
[2:54:05] on the day of Passover
[2:54:08] which was not Friday
[2:54:13] you're going to crucify that lamb
[2:54:15] you're going to sacrifice that lamb
[2:54:19] and had it not been for the Lord
[2:54:21] your whole future
[2:54:24] hung on that lamb being Worthy
[2:54:31] one lamb was too much you could join
[2:54:34] yourself with a household
[2:54:37] share the lamb
[2:54:40] but everybody had to have a lamb
[2:54:44] if you've not fully surrendered your
[2:54:46] life to Jesus Christ I challenge you
[2:54:48] tonight
[2:54:50] I challenge you in his name choose your
[2:54:53] lamb tonight
[2:54:56] choose your salvation tonight your hope
[2:55:00] it's only found in Repentance of sin
[2:55:03] Lord I'm sorry
[2:55:04] for the life I've lived I'm sorry for
[2:55:07] the lies I've told I'm sorry that I have
[2:55:10] left you out of my life
[2:55:13] and I come to you asking that you would
[2:55:16] take your blood and wash me clean
[2:55:20] maybe you would say I don't even know
[2:55:22] how to live a Christian life I don't
[2:55:24] even know how to serve the Lord but if
[2:55:27] you'll cleanse me
[2:55:31] I'll sit at your feet I'll learn What It
[2:55:34] Takes and what it means
[2:55:36] to serve the Lord somebody needs to
[2:55:38] choose their lamb tonight
[2:55:41] for
[2:55:43] [Music]
[2:55:47] fall of another
[2:55:51] [Music]
[2:56:04] and his blood
[2:56:07] heal my body
[2:56:10] and says
[2:56:12] [Music]
[2:56:29] if you're here tonight and you say I
[2:56:30] know Jesus is real
[2:56:33] but I've never made him my lamb
[2:56:36] I've never really chosen him as my lamb
[2:56:38] My Sacrifice
[2:56:42] and if you'll pray for me I I'd like to
[2:56:45] find the strength to make him my Lord
[2:56:49] I'm not going to invite you up here I'm
[2:56:51] not going to come to you unless the Lord
[2:56:53] sends me but I'm just going to ask you
[2:56:55] to raise up your hand right where you
[2:56:56] are you have nothing to be ashamed about
[2:56:58] you see I believe I believe in Jesus but
[2:57:01] I've not made him the Lord of my life
[2:57:03] I've not made in my lamb
[2:57:05] maybe you're watching this service and
[2:57:07] you you've never really made him your
[2:57:09] personal lamb
[2:57:11] that's what he wants to be tonight
[2:57:14] it's not just a household salvation it's
[2:57:17] an individual affair with the Lord Jesus
[2:57:19] he wants to have relationship with you
[2:57:22] as an individual
[2:57:23] and with you who are in this room is
[2:57:25] there someone that would just slip up
[2:57:27] your hand I see some of the children
[2:57:29] raising their hand God bless you for
[2:57:31] that
[2:57:32] you've got to have a lamb you've got to
[2:57:34] have a lamb here's a sweet little sister
[2:57:37] and some little sister back there you've
[2:57:39] got to have a lamb
[2:57:41] I'm so glad he's here I'm so glad he's
[2:57:44] available I'm still glad his blood still
[2:57:46] Cries Out
[2:57:49] if you're near some of these sweet
[2:57:51] children lay your hand on them right now
[2:57:52] and ask the Lord to help them
[2:57:55] if you saw another hand that I might
[2:57:57] have missed I see Moses's hand up
[2:58:01] he's already quite a worshiper but he
[2:58:04] wants to make sure that he has chosen
[2:58:06] his lamb tonight
[2:58:08] if you're near somebody who's put their
[2:58:10] hand up lay hands on them right now
[2:58:12] Tally's got her hand up
[2:58:15] Lord Jesus
[2:58:19] we ask that you would come into our
[2:58:21] lives
[2:58:23] wash us with your precious blood
[2:58:27] we are broken and we long to be whole
[2:58:29] again
[2:58:32] we understand that your blood can make
[2:58:35] us whole
[2:58:37] tonight we choose Jesus
[2:58:40] we choose you as our sacrifice
[2:58:43] [Music]
[2:58:44] we are broken we are wounded
[2:58:48] we are flawed
[2:58:51] but we approach God
[2:58:54] with a Holy Lamb
[2:58:58] and so Lord you don't look at our
[2:59:00] failure
[2:59:02] you look at our offering
[2:59:04] and our offering is the perfect Lamb of
[2:59:07] God John John the Baptist screamed out
[2:59:10] behold
[2:59:13] the Lamb of God that taketh away the
[2:59:16] sins of the world
[2:59:18] that's not just who you were that's who
[2:59:21] you are
[2:59:22] bless these sweet children right now
[2:59:27] I wasn't even three years old when I
[2:59:30] invited the Lord into my life and he
[2:59:32] saved me
[2:59:33] filled me with the Holy Ghost at seven
[2:59:37] so I have a heart for children sometimes
[2:59:40] we as parents and church leaders can
[2:59:42] look over them like they don't
[2:59:44] understand I want you to know something
[2:59:46] children understand more today than they
[2:59:48] used to understand
[2:59:50] let's celebrate the beginning of their
[2:59:53] journey I got saved in a little Baptist

[3:06:58] holy
[3:07:00] [Music]
[3:07:06] holy Lord
[3:07:09] [Music]
[3:07:15] in Sunday School in the
[3:07:18] Pentecostal Church where I grew up
[3:07:22] in our Sunday school literature there
[3:07:24] was a picture of Abraham
[3:07:27] standing there with Isaac
[3:07:31] and the bush
[3:07:33] and the and the horn
[3:07:39] the Jews believed that
[3:07:42] one horn of that Ram represents the
[3:07:45] first Trump
[3:07:47] and the other Horn of that Ram
[3:07:49] represents the last Trump the Trump
[3:07:51] that's going to wake up the bride of
[3:07:52] Christ
[3:07:55] but in that little book it it looked
[3:07:58] like a ram just happened to be
[3:08:01] passing along and
[3:08:04] God allowed it to get its
[3:08:06] horn caught up in the thicket in the
[3:08:09] thorns
[3:08:10] and that's all right
[3:08:13] but that's not how the Jews interpret
[3:08:15] the Hebrew of that verse
[3:08:17] if you look at this little stature here
[3:08:19] you'll see
[3:08:21] that the angel was bringing the
[3:08:23] sacrifice
[3:08:27] they believed that God created
[3:08:32] supernaturally in that moment and that
[3:08:35] he hung that Ram up in the thicket
[3:08:39] but the angel of the Lord brought it I
[3:08:41] don't know whether that's how it
[3:08:42] happened or not but but we can say
[3:08:44] that's
[3:08:45] that makes a lot of sense to me
[3:08:48] and if you need a quote for it I don't
[3:08:50] have I don't have time to read them now
[3:08:52] but brother Branham in talking about
[3:08:54] this story he said well where did our
[3:08:57] Ram come from
[3:08:59] he said Abraham was a hundred miles from
[3:09:02] any civilization in any any kind of
[3:09:04] thing like that he said where did that
[3:09:07] Ram come from he said God put that Ram
[3:09:10] there
[3:09:12] why because it's a perfect type
[3:09:15] of God hanging our lamb
[3:09:19] he came the word became flesh and dwelt
[3:09:24] Among Us
[3:09:25] and I wanted you to leave here tonight
[3:09:27] with an image of that of that next Sun
[3:09:31] carrying that crossbar
[3:09:34] up that hill
[3:09:37] in Abraham's day God intervened and he
[3:09:42] provided a life
[3:09:45] so that Isaac didn't have to give his
[3:09:47] life
[3:09:49] but in our day when our lamb died on
[3:09:52] that cross there was no substitution God
[3:09:55] did not intervene in fact
[3:09:58] God turned the father turned away
[3:10:04] now figuratively we know that that is
[3:10:07] kenosis
[3:10:09] it means that our Lord was emptied in
[3:10:12] that final moment
[3:10:14] he was emptied of all the deity that had
[3:10:16] dwelt in him
[3:10:20] felt it
[3:10:22] can't be a hundred percent God in a
[3:10:25] hundred percent man and that shift like
[3:10:27] that and you not feel it
[3:10:30] he felt that the Divinity the divine
[3:10:33] nature had left him it was essential and
[3:10:36] necessary because God is eternal and the
[3:10:38] Zoe cannot die is that right
[3:10:41] so the deity of God had to leave Christ
[3:10:44] hang him there on the cross and what did
[3:10:47] he do he felt the agony
[3:10:50] oh Father father
[3:10:53] why
[3:10:55] hast Thou forsaken me
[3:11:00] the Bible tells us that figuratively the
[3:11:03] father couldn't even look upon him
[3:11:04] because he was so marred and so scarred
[3:11:08] not just by the beating
[3:11:10] but he had been transformed into the
[3:11:13] very image of sin
[3:11:15] the Bible said he was made sin
[3:11:19] that means that his physical form had
[3:11:23] been altered
[3:11:25] by the load and the weight of the sins
[3:11:28] of the world there was nothing in him
[3:11:31] that anybody would desire him Isaiah
[3:11:33] prophesied so there was nothing in him
[3:11:35] comely or handsome
[3:11:37] he was the very epitome of
[3:11:40] ugly and darkness and evil and a twisted
[3:11:44] physical form hanging there on that
[3:11:47] cross as the deity of the father left
[3:11:49] him somebody said then how are we saved
[3:11:54] then how are we saved if he died a man
[3:11:57] how are we saved anybody want to know
[3:12:01] because he had the blood
[3:12:04] it was the blood of God that was in his
[3:12:08] veins blood that had been specifically
[3:12:11] created by God for the Redemption of the
[3:12:14] world the very Zoe the very Greek word
[3:12:17] Zoe life the eternal life of God was in
[3:12:20] that blood the very life of the father
[3:12:22] was in that blood
[3:12:26] brother vandham said if you'd have been
[3:12:28] underneath that lamb that died that
[3:12:30] animal life the soul of that animal
[3:12:32] couldn't have fallen on you and done a
[3:12:34] thing for you
[3:12:36] but when that one single blood cell of
[3:12:39] our Lord Jesus broke open the life that
[3:12:41] was in that blood fell over on the
[3:12:43] believer and we were forever redeemed
[3:12:48] so don't you get upset if we shout a
[3:12:50] little bit and sing a little bit and
[3:12:51] dance a little bit don't you get a bit
[3:12:52] out of shape we've got everything in the
[3:12:54] world to worship God about
[3:12:56] now father go with us tonight and rest
[3:12:59] our bodies and Minds
[3:13:01] continue to deal with our hearts and
[3:13:03] draw us into your presence meet with us
[3:13:07] tomorrow with the victory of God the
[3:13:09] very shout of the king in the camp
[3:13:12] if there's anything that needs to fall
[3:13:14] off of us in your presence Grant it to
[3:13:17] be so
[3:13:18] granted that it would fall out of our
[3:13:20] lives
[3:13:21] we might be drawn right up into that
[3:13:24] place of Oneness and intimacy with you
[3:13:27] bless these Saints who traveled and
[3:13:28] sacrificed to be here and who have lost
