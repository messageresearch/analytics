[42:57] help her today let's continue to
[43:00] remember Sister Flo and her entire
[43:02] family the entire Hendrick's family that
[43:05] God will strengthen them and help them
[43:09] through the minute by
[43:11] minute life you know the the here and
[43:14] there of life that God will continue to
[43:16] help them I I know of two families that
[43:19] need the Lord to be with them in the
[43:23] process of closing real estate contracts
[43:27] and we're believing that the Lord is in
[43:30] it and that he is going to make a way
[43:32] Lord and then I know of a couple of
[43:34] families who are uh Desiring to be
[43:38] closer and need the Lord to move on
[43:41] their behalf and I believe he will one
[43:44] of those families is is the Millers and
[43:46] they they from from Missouri and God's
[43:49] moving for them he is and the next few
[43:51] days are critical so we're believing
[43:53] that this this is a a manye dream I saw
[43:57] a memory where 11 years ago sister
[44:00] Martha was was lifting up and thanking
[44:03] God for her pastor 11 years and I think
[44:06] it was longer than that that they've
[44:08] been a part of this ministry but not
[44:10] able to be here regularly that's their
[44:12] desire they need God to move on that end
[44:15] and this end amen
[44:18] amen let's take these needs to the Lord
[44:21] today we've been made more than

[46:02] doesn't just have a job he's got the
[46:05] right job nobody wants to be miserable

[1:05:08] rather that is risen again who is even
[1:05:12] at the right hand of God who also maketh
[1:05:15] intercession for us who shall separate
[1:05:19] us from the love of Christ shall
[1:05:22] tribulation or distress or
[1:05:26] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:05:30] Peril or
[1:05:34] sword as it is written for thy sake we
[1:05:37] are killed all the day long we are
[1:05:39] counted as sheep for the slaughter nay
[1:05:42] in all of these things we are more than
[1:05:45] conquerors through him that loved us for
[1:05:49] I am
[1:05:51] persuaded I am persuaded that neither
[1:05:54] death nor life life nor angels nor
[1:05:58] principalities nor powers nor things
[1:06:01] present nor things to come nor height
[1:06:05] nor depth nor any creature shall be able
[1:06:08] to separate us from the love of God
[1:06:12] which is in Christ Jesus our
[1:06:15] lord nothing shall separate
[1:06:22] us the enemy is on a rampage
[1:06:27] but he cannot separate me from the love
[1:06:30] of God which is in Christ Jesus because
[1:06:34] my Lord he went to Calvary and when he
[1:06:37] got done at Calvary he descended into
[1:06:40] the lower parts of the earth and he took
[1:06:42] the keys of death and hell and the grave
[1:06:45] and he is in possession of them today
[1:06:48] and he said that we were in him I am in
[1:06:51] him today and I have in me a Grace to
[1:06:56] overcome death and hell and the grave
[1:07:00] because Jesus lives on the
[1:07:02] [Music]
[1:07:03] inside death can't separate
[1:07:06] me neither can tribulation separate
[1:07:10] me it may distract me for a while but it
[1:07:14] cannot separate me and so I make the
[1:07:17] conscious choice to take that
[1:07:20] distraction and put it in its
[1:07:24] place yes the distractions that come
[1:07:27] even when God is moving all around me I
[1:07:31] make the conscious
[1:07:33] choice to say distractions you cannot
[1:07:37] have the
[1:07:39] preeminence Jesus Christ The Living Word
[1:07:43] is here to have the preeminence and I
[1:07:46] agree with the Living Word to have
[1:07:49] preeminence in my life
[1:07:52] Hallelujah and if our God is for us
[1:07:57] who could ever stop us and if our God is
[1:08:02] with us then what can stand against then
[1:08:07] if our God is for us then who could ever
[1:08:12] stop us and if our God is with us then
[1:08:17] what can stand
[1:08:23] again walking stand
[1:08:30] again oh sing Our God our God is greater
[1:08:35] is greater s our God is
[1:08:39] stronger God you are higher than
[1:08:43] any
[1:08:45] other Oh Our God is healer awesome
[1:08:50] awesome in power Our God our god oh oh
[1:08:55] he's our
[1:08:58] God he's our God why don't we give the

[1:10:51] was so kind at the funeral we were so
[1:10:53] glad to spend some time with her and
[1:10:55] we uh my wife encouraged her to be here
[1:10:58] today and I was in the background saying
[1:11:00] we need you we need you we need you to
[1:11:02] be there and I meant it especially at
[1:11:05] that moment I meant it and I mean it
[1:11:07] this morning thank you for making the
[1:11:09] extra effort to be here today all of you
[1:11:11] it's good to be in God's house there's
[1:11:14] no place that I would rather be than in
[1:11:16] the presence of the Lord we can thank
[1:11:19] God we can experience his presence
[1:11:20] wherever we are but when we come
[1:11:23] together in his name like this we we
[1:11:26] have an opportunity to experience it him
[1:11:30] on a different level aren't you thankful
[1:11:32] for that amen uh we are in a prophetic
[1:11:39] season that we have been marking for
[1:11:42] many years now thank God we only have
[1:11:45] two more days it's called by various
[1:11:49] things but it has been marked
[1:11:53] historically as an extremely
[1:11:55] difficult time for God's people
[1:11:58] particularly the Jewish people but you
[1:12:01] and I have a a spiritual inheritance and
[1:12:05] we are maybe not all of us are a part of
[1:12:07] the natural Seed of Abraham but we
[1:12:10] recognize that we are part of the
[1:12:13] spiritual seed the Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:12:17] and we're thankful for that we identify
[1:12:20] thankfully and proudly with that Royal
[1:12:23] seed if you look at history uh this 3-
[1:12:28] week period i is a time that has been
[1:12:32] marked down Through the Ages it has
[1:12:35] various names some have referred to it
[1:12:38] as the season of the Basilisk that
[1:12:40] sounds a little uh you know mythical to
[1:12:44] some people the Jewish people often call
[1:12:47] it the Dire Straits the season of the of
[1:12:50] the strain there are all kinds of things
[1:12:53] and if you look at this 3-week period
[1:12:56] that will end uh Tuesday on Tish Beav
[1:13:00] which is the day that the temple was
[1:13:02] destroyed not one time but two
[1:13:05] times and uh you that thank God that's
[1:13:09] the end of it but if you watch this uh
[1:13:12] period through history you'll find that
[1:13:15] great persecution and
[1:13:18] adversity has always been a part of this
[1:13:22] season uh exactly why we don't know but
[1:13:25] but we'll tell you this if something
[1:13:27] becomes a tradition or if something
[1:13:29] becomes uh sort of a habitual occurrence
[1:13:33] the enemy will take advantage you know
[1:13:37] if you're a person that says you know
[1:13:39] maybe you're just talking to somebody
[1:13:41] and you say you know uh every every
[1:13:44] month or every other month around the
[1:13:46] middle of the month I just get the
[1:13:48] blues well when you say
[1:13:51] that you you actually open the door you
[1:13:54] you you actually invite depression and
[1:13:58] heaviness to come or sometimes people
[1:14:01] will say you know my precious old
[1:14:03] grandmother Every Spring she would get
[1:14:06] sort of a fever and she would get so low
[1:14:10] and and and so blue and so down and I've
[1:14:13] noticed that in the spring of the year I
[1:14:16] have to fight the same thing well every
[1:14:19] time you say something like that the
[1:14:21] enemy is listening we as a church
[1:14:24] believe that the enemy cannot read your
[1:14:27] mind I know there's a lot of people that
[1:14:29] think he can live in your head and read
[1:14:31] your mind I don't believe that I don't
[1:14:33] find any Scripture that tells me he can
[1:14:36] read my mind but he doesn't have to
[1:14:39] because the reality is most of us talk
[1:14:41] too much anyway and whatever we think we
[1:14:44] say are you with me and so he already
[1:14:47] knows when to hit us and when to when
[1:14:50] when to hit us below the belt and so
[1:14:53] I'll be very thankful we we haven't
[1:14:55] mentioned it in church simply this time
[1:14:58] because we didn't want to invite anymore
[1:15:01] uh but we have marked it as a body uh we
[1:15:05] have there have been Visionary
[1:15:07] experiences to help us to remember this
[1:15:10] time and um one of the things that the
[1:15:13] enemy likes to do if you liken this
[1:15:16] season to the season of the Basilisk the
[1:15:20] Basilisk was perhaps a mythological type
[1:15:25] creature like a a dragon or or a
[1:15:30] unicorn um and it it was known in fact
[1:15:35] it's been in history for so many years
[1:15:37] it appears in in in many ancient
[1:15:41] manuscripts as a creature this is a
[1:15:44] little plain now so hold on that that
[1:15:47] likes to uh take
[1:15:50] advantage of uh I'm going to try to say
[1:15:54] it not nice to take advantage of of
[1:15:58] young
[1:16:00] Offspring before they're
[1:16:02] hatched you know can I just say it like
[1:16:05] a country boy it's known for liking to
[1:16:08] suck
[1:16:10] eggs and it's it's been historically
[1:16:14] recorded and so this has been something
[1:16:17] that has been marked in Judaism for so
[1:16:20] many years because it seems to be for
[1:16:23] whatever reason a season that that the
[1:16:25] enemy likes to attack things that are uh
[1:16:29] growing in embryonic form seed form
[1:16:34] things that have not fully developed and
[1:16:37] we can get we could take the whole
[1:16:39] service I'm not going to but we could
[1:16:41] take the whole service and talk about
[1:16:43] when the enemy sees the
[1:16:45] potential I mean he knows what an egg is
[1:16:48] he knows what new life is he knows that
[1:16:50] that's what keeps a uh a species going
[1:16:55] forward and uh it's it's particularly
[1:16:59] cruel you know to wait till the mother
[1:17:02] is off the nest you know there's uh
[1:17:05] snakes that will do the same thing and
[1:17:08] they will sometimes put their fangs in
[1:17:10] the in the egg and through the
[1:17:12] holes uh uh eat out the egg suck out the
[1:17:16] egg and it sounds just like the devil I
[1:17:19] know people are watching this and you're
[1:17:21] going crazy and you're saying well
[1:17:23] brother brandom never talked about that
[1:17:25] and so there couldn't be anything to it
[1:17:26] and whatever well don't try to tell the
[1:17:29] Jewish people that because it was also
[1:17:31] during that period of time that the that
[1:17:34] the Spaniards drove the Jewish people
[1:17:36] out of the country with such a fer
[1:17:39] fervor during the Spanish Inquisition
[1:17:42] that they nearly marched them right into
[1:17:44] the sea to
[1:17:45] drown they were so determined to get
[1:17:48] them out of their country and you know
[1:17:50] you think that is such a foreign thought
[1:17:52] of of of long ago but I want you to know
[1:17:55] there's a demon of hatred in this nation
[1:17:58] absolutely who could absolutely get that
[1:18:02] wild we're actually acquainted of with a
[1:18:05] young man uh or a man relative of
[1:18:08] someone who has been a part of this
[1:18:10] ministry for some time who lives in a
[1:18:13] neighborhood uh somewhere in the
[1:18:15] Northeast is it New York or I'm talking
[1:18:17] about the the cousin or the nephew that
[1:18:20] that was physically uh beat up in New
[1:18:24] Jersey
[1:18:25] uh because he welcomed a Jewish Family
[1:18:28] into the neighborhood that was all he
[1:18:30] did he's not a Jew he just welcomed a
[1:18:32] Jewish Family into the neighborhood
[1:18:34] because there was such an uproar about
[1:18:36] them moving into the neighborhood that
[1:18:38] he showed them a welcoming spirit and
[1:18:40] they and they nearly beat beat the life
[1:18:42] out of
[1:18:44] him and and so that kind of
[1:18:47] hatred I is could certainly reappear in
[1:18:51] fact it's on the scene and we know it so
[1:18:54] whatever you think about these things
[1:18:57] remember that the enemy knows that God
[1:19:00] is forming something in your
[1:19:02] life and if he can come in and steal in
[1:19:06] a slick
[1:19:08] Sly
[1:19:10] slimy
[1:19:11] deceitful hissing
[1:19:14] way that's exactly what he will do he he
[1:19:18] doesn't want really really really he he
[1:19:20] he knows that he doesn't have power to
[1:19:23] kill you I know there are people people
[1:19:25] out there who believe that the that the
[1:19:27] devil kills people all the time I don't
[1:19:29] believe that it's not scriptural we
[1:19:32] believe in the sovereignty of God we
[1:19:34] believe the enemy can't even touch you
[1:19:37] unless God allows him to by you opening
[1:19:41] the
[1:19:42] door now does he want to sure he'd like
[1:19:45] to but he's beg to learn that he doesn't
[1:19:47] have as much power as he would like to
[1:19:49] have he has the power you give him he
[1:19:53] has the power that the bride yields to
[1:19:55] him and so what he would then like to do
[1:19:58] is leave you an empty
[1:20:00] shell he he would like to take your
[1:20:02] vision your purpose your call you know
[1:20:06] your why the vision of your life the
[1:20:10] goal of your life uh the the ministry
[1:20:13] what what you desire to do for God and
[1:20:16] he would like to suck that out of you I
[1:20:19] know it's a forgive the analogy is so
[1:20:21] plain but he would like to suck the life
[1:20:23] out of you and leave you a walking a
[1:20:26] dead a zombie you know who has no real
[1:20:29] life just a shell of a man but but we're
[1:20:33] here to tell you today that if you're
[1:20:36] filled with the Holy Spirit greater is
[1:20:39] he that is in you than he that is in the
[1:20:43] world and as long as you don't fear that
[1:20:46] devil and recognize who you are in
[1:20:49] Christ you can beat him back every
[1:20:53] single time time and this is our
[1:20:57] responsibility and we must do it with
[1:20:59] everything that we have I didn't see any
[1:21:02] birthdays on the calendar other than
[1:21:04] sister Anita Christian and uh of course
[1:21:07] she's not with us on Sunday mornings but
[1:21:10] uh hopefully she will see this and know
[1:21:13] that we love her and we wish her the
[1:21:15] best of birthdays this week and maybe
[1:21:18] maybe we'll see them on Tuesday night uh
[1:21:21] I know that we've had enough singing I
[1:21:24] don't want to say too much singing but I
[1:21:27] made such a mess of the song um at the
[1:21:30] funeral that I want to sing it again uh
[1:21:35] here uh with my own uh
[1:21:40] instruments I hope he doesn't hear this
[1:21:42] cuz he told me that he streams our
[1:21:44] service but sometime but I told the
[1:21:47] pastor when I got out at the grave I I
[1:21:50] said you know why don't you tell that
[1:21:53] boor but because I've been told for
[1:21:55] years that property's paid off and so
[1:21:57] forth several people told us they don't
[1:21:59] owe any have any debt and I said why
[1:22:01] don't you talk to that bored about
[1:22:03] getting you all a better sound
[1:22:05] system because it would be a great
[1:22:08] blessing and he said well that's the
[1:22:10] first time has ever done that I said oh
[1:22:12] no it did it about three years ago when
[1:22:13] I was preaching here so maybe I'm the
[1:22:16] problem and not the sound system so let

[1:27:19] every one of you for your prayers for
[1:27:22] them we're depending on you to keep them
[1:27:25] up amen and they were great strength to
[1:27:29] the family and your presence at the
[1:27:31] viewing uh meant a lot to the family and
[1:27:34] your presence at the funeral those of
[1:27:36] you who were able to go and there were
[1:27:39] some who even made a sacrifice to take
[1:27:41] off work to be there to support the
[1:27:44] family and they appreciated it very very
[1:27:47] much and for your giving today some of
[1:27:50] you gave
[1:27:51] online someone contacted me the day
[1:27:54] after the death and said uh I want to be
[1:27:57] a part of anything that the church does
[1:28:00] to bless the family whether it's food or
[1:28:02] whatever it is and so uh thank you for
[1:28:05] your giving as well and we look forward
[1:28:09] to an eternity with brother Garvis Jr
[1:28:13] and with you so you better make it you
[1:28:17] better go all the way somebody say amen
[1:28:19] amen all right would you turn in your
[1:28:22] Bible this morning and and I'll do my
[1:28:24] best to not drag this out any longer
[1:28:27] than we have to but uh I do have some
[1:28:31] things that I want to get in I want you
[1:28:33] to turn to 2 Thessalonians if you will
[1:28:37] chapter
[1:28:38] 2 verse 11 and
[1:28:42] 12 we have been on for a couple of weeks
[1:28:46] now we have been on a series concerning
[1:28:51] cold
[1:28:52] love and and the Bible tells us Jesus
[1:28:56] said it's red letter and he said because
[1:29:00] iniquity shall abound the love of many
[1:29:05] shall do what it shall wax cold it shall
[1:29:08] become Frozen now what you can do with
[1:29:11] Frozen love I don't know it doesn't help
[1:29:14] anybody does it it's kind of locked
[1:29:16] inside of you and love is not something
[1:29:20] that we hold on to love is something
[1:29:23] that we give away yes and our most
[1:29:26] important love relationship is not
[1:29:29] husband and wife our most import our
[1:29:32] boyfriend girlfriend but our most
[1:29:35] important love relationship is with the
[1:29:37] Lord Jesus Christ and the sooner that
[1:29:41] you can begin to think of him in that
[1:29:43] manner and understand the bridal
[1:29:46] Paradigm the quicker you'll be able to
[1:29:48] come into h a passionate relationship
[1:29:52] with him he longs to spend time with us
[1:29:55] not just on Sunday morning but he longs
[1:29:58] to be a part of our everyday life if the
[1:30:01] enemy can bind us with generational
[1:30:06] iniquities spirits that have traveled
[1:30:08] down through the
[1:30:10] generations if the enemy can bind us
[1:30:13] with that and frees up our love he can
[1:30:16] affect greatly our relationship with the
[1:30:19] Lord he he really it's our fellowship
[1:30:22] that he can hinder the most
[1:30:24] he can't change our destiny aren't you
[1:30:26] glad for that and and by doing so church
[1:30:30] he affects our relationship with one
[1:30:32] another and with the world around us
[1:30:35] God's people got to be full of love we
[1:30:38] have to be full of love and the enemy
[1:30:40] will do anything and everything he can
[1:30:42] to freeze that love in 2 Thessalonians
[1:30:46] chapter 2 and verse 11 and 12 the
[1:30:50] Apostle said and for this cause shall
[1:30:54] send them strong
[1:30:57] delusion that they should believe a
[1:31:02] lie that they all might be damned who
[1:31:07] believed not the truth but had pleasure
[1:31:12] in unrighteousness this is the program
[1:31:16] of the enemy in the last days he wants
[1:31:20] to so sear men's conscience
[1:31:24] with a hot iron that they can no longer
[1:31:27] feel any conviction for their behavior
[1:31:30] for their
[1:31:31] lifestyle and because this Antichrist
[1:31:35] spirit is already in the Earth the
[1:31:38] apostle was warning us that even in the
[1:31:40] last days the spirits would
[1:31:44] mature and they would become so
[1:31:47] effective in the last days that they
[1:31:50] would be able to send a strong illusion
[1:31:55] upon people who did not like to retain
[1:31:58] the truth of God in their heart and he
[1:32:01] would give them such a delusion that
[1:32:04] they would believe a lie and the lie
[1:32:07] that they would believe would cause them
[1:32:10] instead of Liberty it would cause them
[1:32:14] damnation and they will think that they
[1:32:17] are believing the truth right now we
[1:32:20] could look at the political situation in
[1:32:22] this nation and say we know that's
[1:32:24] possible we know that's possible let me
[1:32:27] read it to you in the Amplified and then
[1:32:29] you can have your seat therefore God
[1:32:32] sends them upon them a
[1:32:36] misleading
[1:32:40] influence you know kind of like
[1:32:42] photoshopping if we were looking at
[1:32:44] politics that's not what we want to talk
[1:32:46] about today but kind of like
[1:32:48] photoshopping a
[1:32:50] crowd where there is no crowd making
[1:32:54] people think that this lie is gaining
[1:32:57] intraction and gaining multitudes of
[1:32:59] people when the reality is not and what
[1:33:03] happens in that discourages people from
[1:33:05] voting their own conscience their own
[1:33:07] conviction they just say what's the use
[1:33:09] we're overwhelmed they're going to cheat
[1:33:11] anyway and blah blah blah blah blah uh
[1:33:14] that's one thing politics is one Arena
[1:33:17] but when what the enemy really wants to
[1:33:19] do is is is rock your world so that you
[1:33:24] turn loose of
[1:33:25] Calvary a and and what's the use anyway
[1:33:28] he'd like to say so God even God had to
[1:33:32] send a misleading influence a working of
[1:33:35] error and a strong
[1:33:38] delusion to make them believe what is
[1:33:43] false in order that all may be judged
[1:33:46] and condemned who did not believe in who
[1:33:49] refused to adhere to trust in and rely
[1:33:53] on the truth but instead took pleasure
[1:33:58] in
[1:33:59] unrighteousness we're not talking about
[1:34:01] an influence that causes people just to
[1:34:04] change churches we're talking about a
[1:34:07] spirit that wants to take people off the
[1:34:10] word and the Lord spoke to our hearts as
[1:34:13] we started the series and we're going to
[1:34:15] pray he spoke to our hearts and he said
[1:34:18] there are three
[1:34:20] spirits that the bride is going and I'm
[1:34:23] sure sure there many more but three were
[1:34:26] highlighted that the bride is going to
[1:34:29] have to contend with in the last days
[1:34:32] one is a religious spirit one is a
[1:34:35] seducing spirit that brings delusion and
[1:34:39] another are familiar spirits I'm sure
[1:34:43] there are many others out there but
[1:34:45] these were the ones that were
[1:34:46] highlighted let's pray just a moment
[1:34:48] father we have used up a lot of our time
[1:34:52] but we used it giving you glory and
[1:34:55] honor and praise and so we don't regret
[1:34:58] any of it this is your time Lord this
[1:35:02] doesn't belong to family dinner this
[1:35:04] doesn't belong to birthday celebration
[1:35:08] this doesn't belong to family reunion
[1:35:10] this is your time we have set this aside
[1:35:15] to honor you and to honor your word and
[1:35:17] to hallow and make holy and reverent
[1:35:20] your name we recognize that the enemy
[1:35:23] howls and rages in this hour against our
[1:35:27] coming together and he offers us excuses
[1:35:30] to try to get us persuaded not to be
[1:35:32] here but Lord I want you to know I want
[1:35:35] you to be very aware of th those who
[1:35:38] have pushed through those who are
[1:35:42] standing in your presence today and we
[1:35:45] are thankful for for you allowing us to
[1:35:48] have fellowship with you but we're
[1:35:50] hungry to hear the word of the Lord so
[1:35:54] we ask that you would bind up
[1:35:56] distraction and that you would help us
[1:35:58] to pull with our faith upon the gift of
[1:36:01] God that you might be able to talk to us
[1:36:05] in this trying time a time of testing
[1:36:09] and sifting you are faithful and true
[1:36:12] and tonight today this afternoon we
[1:36:15] bless your name and we lift you up in
[1:36:19] this house we ask for your help in the
[1:36:21] name of the Lord Jesus J Christ and for
[1:36:25] his glory we ask it and the church said
[1:36:29] amen you may be seated so the three
[1:36:32] spirits that we must contend with in
[1:36:36] this season of proving number one was a
[1:36:39] seducing lying Spirit number two was
[1:36:42] religious spirits and that comes in the
[1:36:45] form of delusions the prophet of God
[1:36:48] tells us that of all the evil spirits a
[1:36:53] Rel religious spirit is one of the most
[1:36:56] difficult spirits to identify and to
[1:36:59] deal with because it strengthens itself
[1:37:03] with the language with the vocabulary
[1:37:06] with the jargon of Christianity oh it's
[1:37:09] just a churchy devil it's a churchy
[1:37:12] spirit it's a spirit that often affects
[1:37:16] people by causing them to cling to their
[1:37:19] Traditions while rejecting the word of
[1:37:22] the Lord amen amen and so uh we wouldn't
[1:37:26] think particularly that the bride would
[1:37:29] have to contend with such things but if
[1:37:32] the enemy can break your
[1:37:34] fellowship with the with your creator
[1:37:37] with your lover with your savior if he
[1:37:40] can break your fellowship with him
[1:37:42] that's exactly what he wants to do he
[1:37:44] can just go lay
[1:37:45] down because that broken Fellowship will
[1:37:49] bring you into a tail spin he won't have
[1:37:52] to keep spinning you around life has a
[1:37:56] way of doing that so if the enemy can
[1:37:59] cause you to fall under a delusion where
[1:38:02] you convince yourself that you are right
[1:38:05] you are following the leadership of a
[1:38:08] feeling or what people like to say I
[1:38:10] feel led well you know sometimes uh we
[1:38:15] we need more than just a feeling to lead
[1:38:18] us I'm I'm going just I'm going to amen
[1:38:20] myself just a minute Amen brother Shelly
[1:38:24] the Bible said it didn't say we're going
[1:38:26] to be led by feelings because feelings
[1:38:28] will fail you but the Bible said it's
[1:38:31] many as are led by the spirit of God
[1:38:35] these
[1:38:36] are the sons of God so our
[1:38:41] leadership is a
[1:38:44] manifestation of our
[1:38:46] sunship and so if we're following uh
[1:38:49] fake media instead of the word of God
[1:38:54] now you know uh the that that fake Media
[1:38:58] stuff it doesn't just want to
[1:39:00] influence uh politics it wants to
[1:39:04] influence
[1:39:06] medicine how you look at the medical
[1:39:08] world and some people are so
[1:39:12] enamored with doctors and drugs until
[1:39:17] they believe everything they're
[1:39:19] told and that's why when I on that rare
[1:39:24] occasion that I go to the doctor my
[1:39:27] heart goes out to the
[1:39:29] seniors because they're sitting there
[1:39:32] with gallons siiz bags
[1:39:36] Ziplocs with not two or three
[1:39:39] bottles 15 20 or more bottles there's no
[1:39:45] way in the world that a doctor treating
[1:39:48] all of these conditions in general
[1:39:51] medicine could keep up up with every
[1:39:54] small detail of all of the side effects
[1:39:59] and the dangers of laying One Drug on
[1:40:02] top of another drug but blindly people
[1:40:06] heard themselves in on
[1:40:10] now sacrifice great deals of money to
[1:40:14] make sure that they've got enough help
[1:40:16] to pay for the for those prescriptions
[1:40:19] taking somebody's word that it's going
[1:40:22] to help them when in in reality many
[1:40:24] times I'm not against medicine but many
[1:40:27] times it shortens someone's life they're
[1:40:30] fighting to Live While poisoning
[1:40:33] themselves to death that's right but the
[1:40:35] older you get the more you need to trust
[1:40:38] somebody or trust something so the enemy
[1:40:41] uses fake media uh for things like that
[1:40:45] and and as early as recent as yesterday
[1:40:50] they have issued great warnings across
[1:40:53] our nation about the uptake of covid and
[1:40:57] the the necessity of even the newest uh
[1:41:01] shot even the newest immunization to to
[1:41:05] keep that at Bay and it becomes a a
[1:41:08] gerbal wheel you know I I'm telling you
[1:41:12] the
[1:41:13] truth I'm not trying to bash medicine I
[1:41:16] just want to show you how the enemy can
[1:41:18] fool people into believing anything that
[1:41:21] they're told you've got family members
[1:41:23] you trust and if they tell you something
[1:41:26] you don't you know they wouldn't lie so
[1:41:28] it has to be so and you pass it on how
[1:41:31] many times on social media have you ever
[1:41:34] seen a post that that is about someone's
[1:41:37] dire problem their horrible need that
[1:41:40] they have or something tragic that's
[1:41:43] happened to them and and someone shares
[1:41:46] it reshares it but they put a tag at the
[1:41:49] top that says my cousin know knows this
[1:41:55] person or my uncle is neighbor to this
[1:41:59] person anybody ever seen something like
[1:42:01] that and in reality it's a lie it's fake
[1:42:06] someone has passed it on and said I know
[1:42:09] this person why would somebody lie like
[1:42:12] that if you don't know them why because
[1:42:14] they feel like if they say they know the
[1:42:18] person it adds
[1:42:21] credibility to the situation
[1:42:25] hello come on so you'll see those
[1:42:29] photographs of alligators as big as the
[1:42:33] platform and somebody said my cousin has
[1:42:36] a fish camp next to this slew where this
[1:42:41] alligator lives and so everyone believes
[1:42:44] that there's really an alligator bigger
[1:42:46] than this platform cuz there's a picture
[1:42:49] if it's a picture it has to be so right
[1:42:51] on did you know with AI you can just
[1:42:54] speak to your computer and tell it what
[1:42:56] you want to look
[1:42:59] at do you understand that I could tell
[1:43:02] uh artificial intelligence to search my
[1:43:05] photos and find a photo of me and put me
[1:43:08] at the Red Sea
[1:43:10] crossing right did you know artificial
[1:43:13] intelligence has the possibility of
[1:43:15] doing that so then I could show you this
[1:43:17] picture and try to convince you that I
[1:43:20] was really there I know some of you
[1:43:21] think I'm that old but I wasn't there
[1:43:24] there do you see how dangerous that
[1:43:26] stuff can
[1:43:29] become do you realize that then you can
[1:43:31] put somebody coming out of a hotel with
[1:43:33] a
[1:43:34] hooker that wasn't there I'm just being
[1:43:37] honest it why would well why would
[1:43:40] somebody bother to take the time to do
[1:43:42] that because seducing spirits will
[1:43:45] convince people you're doing the right
[1:43:48] thing you're just having
[1:43:50] fun not thinking about the fact that
[1:43:53] lives are being ruined so you can't
[1:43:56] believe everything you read about
[1:43:58] anybody you can't read everything you
[1:44:01] can't believe everything you read about
[1:44:03] President Trump that's right he's a
[1:44:07] man he puts his pants on like the rest
[1:44:10] of us Fellers do he's prone to be a
[1:44:14] human an unregenerated human he's not
[1:44:18] Christ he's not going to save America
[1:44:23] he might be able to help us if by
[1:44:26] Miracle he gets back into some kind of
[1:44:28] position but he can't save America folks
[1:44:32] he can't even really make America great
[1:44:35] again only Jesus Christ could do that
[1:44:39] because a president can't change the
[1:44:41] hearts of men and women and I want you
[1:44:43] to know the ship has sailed on many
[1:44:46] people wanting anything that has to do
[1:44:48] with conservative Bible believing or or
[1:44:52] oldfashioned in Christianity we're in
[1:44:55] need in our nation and we're in trouble
[1:44:59] and part of the reason why is the enemy
[1:45:02] has found all kinds of ways to seduce
[1:45:05] and to deceive and to lie and offer fake
[1:45:09] media and they keep telling people for
[1:45:12] instance I'm on a roll so I'm sorry
[1:45:14] about that they keep telling people for
[1:45:17] instance that that we're not in it this
[1:45:20] is not inflation
[1:45:23] wow prices are better than they've been
[1:45:25] in so long how many of you know it's
[1:45:28] just not
[1:45:30] true and and they'll tell you you know
[1:45:32] we inherited the worst economy in
[1:45:35] history well that might have had a
[1:45:36] little something to do with the
[1:45:39] pandemic and the problem is you didn't
[1:45:41] do much to fix it you've actually ended
[1:45:44] up making it
[1:45:48] worse but they will say all kinds of
[1:45:51] things and unfort fortunately people
[1:45:54] refuse to look at numbers they'll
[1:45:55] believe whatever they hear now we're
[1:45:58] dealing with the same thing in
[1:46:00] Christianity there are Scholars out
[1:46:03] there who will take a Hebrew word
[1:46:05] referring to a young virgin and they
[1:46:09] will tell you that it doesn't really
[1:46:11] mean Virgin It Means A young
[1:46:15] Maiden not necessarily a virgin not
[1:46:19] necessarily one who hasn't been with a
[1:46:22] man but just of a certain young age and
[1:46:26] articles will be written and sermons
[1:46:29] will be preached and denominations will
[1:46:32] vote in uh articles of
[1:46:37] faith and millions of votes will be cast
[1:46:41] to say we no longer believe in the
[1:46:44] Virgin
[1:46:45] birth of the Lord Jesus Christ it's
[1:46:49] happening there's been great division
[1:46:52] even in the United Methodist Church and
[1:46:56] bibles Rewritten and new versions made
[1:47:02] it's not just a hillbilly new version of
[1:47:04] the Bible or the redneck new version of
[1:47:07] the Bible or the ebonic new version of
[1:47:11] the Bible but people are just writing a
[1:47:14] Bible to fit their own thoughts and
[1:47:16] ideas but if it says holy Bible on the
[1:47:19] front folks it has to be right right
[1:47:25] no but the enemy can print anything he
[1:47:28] wants to print on
[1:47:30] there somebody said for instance you
[1:47:32] know we don't believe in a Rapture
[1:47:34] anymore because Rapture is not in the
[1:47:37] Bible did you know the word bible is not
[1:47:39] in the
[1:47:42] Bible somebody said oh yes it is it's on
[1:47:45] the cover it's on my fly Lea but I want
[1:47:48] you to know from Genesis 1 all the way
[1:47:50] to the last verse of Revelation the word
[1:47:52] word Bible doesn't appear in the
[1:47:54] scripture that doesn't mean that we
[1:47:56] can't call it a Bible or Holy Scripture
[1:48:00] just because the word rapture doesn't
[1:48:02] appear in the Bible doesn't mean there's
[1:48:04] not going to be a catching away of the
[1:48:06] Bride do you understand what I'm saying
[1:48:09] sir do you know major denominations have
[1:48:11] accepted the fact and said there's no
[1:48:14] virgin
[1:48:15] birth did you know that major
[1:48:17] denominations have come along and said
[1:48:20] that the whole concept of Jesus died
[1:48:22] ding on a cross to pay for someone
[1:48:25] else's sin could not possibly be right
[1:48:29] and that the Bible is no more than a
[1:48:31] book of judgment and there's no life and
[1:48:34] no love and no hope for those who follow
[1:48:38] the scripture especially with the
[1:48:40] thoughts of
[1:48:41] inherency and if you think that's a
[1:48:43] handful of people on the backside of Los
[1:48:45] Angeles who believes that the world
[1:48:48] Embraces that kind of stuff do you know
[1:48:51] why because they don't want to have a
[1:48:53] law to follow they don't want a book of
[1:48:56] instructions to follow they want to do
[1:48:58] what's right in their own eyes and in
[1:49:01] their own
[1:49:02] minds and the churches are being
[1:49:04] affected and the gospel is being watered
[1:49:10] down and who's responsible for it the
[1:49:14] devil and his
[1:49:16] pimps which often times are his
[1:49:21] preachers because they Embrace these
[1:49:23] lies and spoon feed them to the people
[1:49:27] and some have you know brother brandham
[1:49:29] talks about mother being the Fifth
[1:49:32] Gospel Mar Matthew Mark Luke John mother
[1:49:36] and the reality is you learn as a child
[1:49:39] sometime more from your mother than you
[1:49:40] do Matthew Mark Luke or John so it's
[1:49:43] important to be a good mother but but I
[1:49:46] have recently heard that there's a new
[1:49:48] Fifth Gospel and that it's Matthew Mark
[1:49:51] Luke John and Google
[1:49:56] because that's where a lot of people go
[1:49:57] to get their
[1:49:59] bearing for what is
[1:50:02] truth when we have to go to the Bible
[1:50:05] I'm going to preach
[1:50:08] now remember
[1:50:12] study not commentary and dictionary
[1:50:15] study this
[1:50:18] scripture to show thyself a Workman that
[1:50:21] needeth not to be shamed rightly
[1:50:25] dividing cuz there's a devil out there
[1:50:27] that wants you to water it down and pass
[1:50:30] on an abbreviated
[1:50:32] version somebody ought to fight for the
[1:50:35] Virgin
[1:50:36] birth somebody ought to fight for
[1:50:39] Redemption by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:50:42] somebody ought to fight that the church
[1:50:44] at large is baptizing people under a
[1:50:48] demonic influence instead of in the name
[1:50:51] of the Lord Jesus Christ Christ somebody
[1:50:54] stand up and say I'm not I refuse to be
[1:50:57] baptized in titles when the Bible said
[1:51:01] that he has chosen a name he has highly
[1:51:04] exalted a name that everything should be
[1:51:08] done in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:51:11] Christ see it's one thing if you Google
[1:51:14] it and it says that William brandom is a
[1:51:16] false prophet but if you keep reading
[1:51:19] you're going to find out that it will
[1:51:21] also eventually tell you that the book
[1:51:24] of Acts is the end of the of the
[1:51:28] dispensation of
[1:51:30] Miracles and gifts and Supernatural
[1:51:34] living if you keep reading it will
[1:51:37] convince you it will seek to convince
[1:51:40] you that God is three
[1:51:45] persons and that totally
[1:51:49] contradicts the word somebody said the
[1:51:51] words of a prophet I I'm not interested
[1:51:53] in that right now it contradicts the
[1:51:55] words of Jesus Christ Our Messiah our
[1:51:59] Lord when he said you've got to get this
[1:52:02] straight you religious
[1:52:04] Crooks when you've seen
[1:52:08] me well I said we want to see the father
[1:52:11] he said H I've been with you all this
[1:52:14] [Music]
[1:52:15] time ain't that interesting he said you
[1:52:18] you've had him with you the whole time
[1:52:21] and you've refused ref used to see him
[1:52:24] because you wanted him to be an old man
[1:52:26] with white hair and a and a gavel
[1:52:29] sitting on a judge's bench or you wanted
[1:52:32] him to be some ethereal cloud or you
[1:52:35] wanted him to look like this or that or
[1:52:37] the other so when he came in a body of
[1:52:39] Flesh you didn't even know who he was
[1:52:44] you students of the law you religious
[1:52:47] Hypocrites you didn't even know him when
[1:52:50] he walked among you
[1:52:53] no wonder he said you're nothing more
[1:52:55] than whed supplers but on the inside
[1:52:59] you're Graves full of dead men's bones
[1:53:03] your religion is going to damn you
[1:53:06] because you fail to see the truth it
[1:53:10] stands before you come on there's only
[1:53:14] one scripture in the Bible that even
[1:53:15] mentions the three other than the titles
[1:53:18] and that's a scripture that says there
[1:53:20] are three that bear record in heaven I I
[1:53:22] have no problem with that that's the
[1:53:24] word says the Father the word and the
[1:53:27] spirit father son Spirit father word
[1:53:30] spirit and don't forget you folks now
[1:53:33] trying to talk us out of the Oneness of
[1:53:35] God don't forget the rest of the
[1:53:38] scripture somebody said but the there
[1:53:41] was a voice and somebody said there was
[1:53:43] a dove and somebody said who was he
[1:53:45] praying
[1:53:47] to it's so easy to get caught up in
[1:53:50] craziness
[1:53:52] but the rest of that verse said and
[1:53:54] these three are
[1:54:01] three these three are
[1:54:03] one you've got three different Offices
[1:54:06] here you've got three different
[1:54:07] manifestations here but in the end
[1:54:09] there's only one Spirit if we've got
[1:54:12] more than one Spirit to worship I'm very
[1:54:15] confused with what the scripture teaches
[1:54:18] there's one Jesus had a father somebody
[1:54:22] said who was the father and the church
[1:54:24] says the
[1:54:26] father but the Bible didn't say
[1:54:29] that the Bible said and the Holy
[1:54:32] Ghost overshadowed
[1:54:35] Mary and she conceived the Lord Jesus
[1:54:38] Christ so who is the father of the Lord
[1:54:42] Jesus Christ the Holy
[1:54:44] Ghost then how could there not be two
[1:54:47] because there's only one spirit in the
[1:54:49] first place according to the scripture
[1:54:51] the min Ministry is different the office
[1:54:54] is different the administration may be
[1:54:57] different but here o
[1:55:02] Israel the Lord our God is one but the
[1:55:06] enemy and somebody says if you don't
[1:55:08] believe in the Trinity you are not even
[1:55:14] Christian aren't you glad they don't get
[1:55:16] to
[1:55:17] decide what kind of relationship you
[1:55:19] have with him I've been told now for 4
[1:55:22] 40 years that because I don't have a
[1:55:24] Christmas tree I'm not a
[1:55:27] Christian so the world must have a very
[1:55:30] loose definition of what it takes to be
[1:55:34] a Christian if you don't mind I'll just
[1:55:37] stay with the
[1:55:39] word I'm not looking to the Fifth Gospel
[1:55:42] of
[1:55:43] Google I'm looking to the inherency of
[1:55:46] the scripture all men can make mistakes
[1:55:50] all men can miss speak all men can
[1:55:55] mislead all men can exaggerate and
[1:55:58] embellish the truth you don't even have
[1:56:01] to be a preacher to be to embellish the
[1:56:04] truth fishermen do it all the
[1:56:06] time you can't trust that but thanks be
[1:56:11] to God there is
[1:56:13] something that is such an
[1:56:16] absolute that no matter what's going on
[1:56:19] politically the word is the same no
[1:56:22] matter what's going on in every other
[1:56:24] Arena of Life the word Remains the Same
[1:56:29] when men are fighting to interpret the
[1:56:32] message that was supposed to help us
[1:56:35] understand the word and they're fighting
[1:56:38] over it to the point of calling one
[1:56:40] another's name and spitting in Anger at
[1:56:44] one another and damning each other to
[1:56:46] serpent seed there is a word there is a
[1:56:50] scripture there is a holy Bible there is
[1:56:53] a book come on now that never changes
[1:56:57] itself it never has to update itself
[1:57:00] praise be to
[1:57:02] God it remains a constant it's like the
[1:57:06] North Star it doesn't move you always
[1:57:09] can know that that's the right direction
[1:57:12] you can always know you're standing in
[1:57:14] truth when you're standing on the word
[1:57:17] somebody ought to say Amen well you're
[1:57:19] really wild this morning I am because he
[1:57:22] said that one of the spirits the bride
[1:57:25] would have to deal with was seducing
[1:57:28] spirits and delusional spirits who would
[1:57:31] make them believe all kinds of crazy
[1:57:34] things like the resurrection of a
[1:57:36] prophet who has to come back and ride in
[1:57:38] an airplane and pitch a tent and do all
[1:57:40] kinds of things in order for the word of
[1:57:42] God to be fulfilled
[1:57:44] folks if it's not in the
[1:57:48] book it doesn't matter who aunt Suzie
[1:57:52] Beth had a
[1:57:55] dream doesn't matter what preacher had a
[1:57:59] vision if it can't line up with the
[1:58:03] word this little bride will never
[1:58:05] will'll never swallow it we've heard
[1:58:08] that we've heard something in this
[1:58:10] message that Echoes to us a great truth
[1:58:13] get in Step stay in
[1:58:17] St you don't get your eyes on voice of
[1:58:19] God recording you get your eyes is on
[1:58:22] the
[1:58:25] Lord sir someone recently who was a
[1:58:28] member of this church some years ago
[1:58:30] recently told one of our members I'm
[1:58:32] aligned with Brother Joseph I said I
[1:58:35] hope somebody will tell her you better
[1:58:37] get in alignment with Jesus
[1:58:41] Christ you better know that you've got a
[1:58:44] relationship with him you don't have to
[1:58:47] go through in this hour I may be making
[1:58:49] enemies here you don't have to go
[1:58:51] through a Prophet to get to
[1:58:54] Jesus he wants to have fellowship with
[1:58:57] you now when you want to start
[1:58:59] understanding the word like you've never
[1:59:01] understood it before God sent a
[1:59:05] message he sent a messenger with a
[1:59:07] message and we haven't changed our mind
[1:59:11] I know where I would be without this
[1:59:14] message and messenger but I have been
[1:59:17] able to come this far now because my
[1:59:20] eyes were not on a
[1:59:23] man you know he said that remember he
[1:59:25] said that remember he said don't pay any
[1:59:28] attention to the
[1:59:31] messenger he said it's the message
[1:59:33] that's going to get the bride out of
[1:59:34] here he said I make way too many
[1:59:37] mistakes he said I was just thinking of
[1:59:39] a mistake just recently something I got
[1:59:42] a little twisted up he said but but he
[1:59:44] never he never fails he never oh thank
[1:59:49] God somebody said well we don't know
[1:59:50] these men that interp we don't know
[1:59:52] these men that translated the Bible and
[1:59:54] we don't know folks the holy spirit of
[1:59:56] God in you will tell you this word is
[1:59:58] right and if you have confidence in a
[2:00:01] prophet hear what he said he said that's
[2:00:03] the absolute that's what we're standing
[2:00:05] on come on now and while many people
[2:00:08] called The Church ages and the seals the
[2:00:10] revelation of Jesus Christ he said the
[2:00:12] truth revealed from Genesis to
[2:00:15] Revelation he said that's the revelation
[2:00:17] of Jesus Christ it's revealed in the
[2:00:20] book
[2:00:26] hello are you stirred yeah I'm
[2:00:28] stirred I'm stirred I am stirred we're
[2:00:32] living in an hour where you better get
[2:00:35] stirred second uh second Thessalonians
[2:00:38] chapter 2 beginning in verse three this
[2:00:41] time he said let no man deceive you by
[2:00:44] any means for that day shall not
[2:00:48] come
[2:00:50] except that is Amplified I want the uh
[2:00:53] uh I want the King James I
[2:00:57] think let no man deceive you by any
[2:01:00] means for that day shall not come except
[2:01:03] there come a falling away first are you
[2:01:08] with me and the man excuse me and that
[2:01:12] man of sin be
[2:01:15] revealed the son of
[2:01:17] predition that sounds pretty serious
[2:01:20] doesn't it who oppos and exalteth
[2:01:23] himself above all that is called God or
[2:01:27] that is worshiped so that he as God as
[2:01:31] potentate as
[2:01:34] Pope sets himself in the temple of God
[2:01:38] showing himself that he is God here's
[2:01:40] one thing you can't deny I know I added
[2:01:43] a word forgive me go straight back to
[2:01:45] the
[2:01:46] absolute but here's one thing you can't
[2:01:49] deny the the very theme of Pap
[2:01:54] Rome is in the stead of God right if I
[2:02:02] were to tell you that you should listen
[2:02:03] to brother brandham instead of God
[2:02:08] wouldn't that be a Antichrist
[2:02:11] Spirit if I should tell you that you
[2:02:13] should take something that you hear on a
[2:02:16] tape that you have so much confidence in
[2:02:18] but if there's something on that tape
[2:02:20] that's contrary
[2:02:22] to the Bible somebody said I don't think
[2:02:24] there will be you might be
[2:02:27] surprised if there is something there
[2:02:31] that's contrary to the Bible and I say
[2:02:35] I'm going to believe this no matter what
[2:02:37] the Bible said wouldn't that be a part
[2:02:42] of that
[2:02:44] Antichrist
[2:02:46] Spirit you see that's where the foolish
[2:02:48] virgins are going to be
[2:02:50] found they're not just going to be be
[2:02:53] found out there among the
[2:02:54] denominations they don't make it that
[2:02:58] far they're going to be found among
[2:03:00] those who know the
[2:03:03] way but don't get the the
[2:03:06] oil you're going to have to have that's
[2:03:08] quiet it doesn't matter I I I'm I'm very
[2:03:11] confident in what I'm saying you're
[2:03:13] going to have to have the Holy Ghost and
[2:03:15] it's going to have to be more than
[2:03:18] snot and
[2:03:20] slobber you're you're going to have to
[2:03:22] know that he has anchored in your soul
[2:03:24] in your spirit until you have found new
[2:03:28] strength to shun the devil and to resist
[2:03:31] the temptation that has haunted you your
[2:03:34] entire life the prophet tells us one
[2:03:37] thing about knowing that we've received
[2:03:38] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he he
[2:03:40] believed that the sign or the evidence
[2:03:43] of that was being able to say Amen to
[2:03:46] every word of God so around the message
[2:03:49] they seem to think that if you just a
[2:03:56] minute it's getting tight in here if you
[2:04:00] just a minute you got the Holy Ghost do
[2:04:02] you think that's really what he was
[2:04:04] telling us somehow I don't think so
[2:04:08] because the scripture tells us that the
[2:04:12] Devils the demons
[2:04:18] believe and tremble
[2:04:22] and that means if possible or necessary
[2:04:25] they could even say
[2:04:27] Amen why they could probably amen any
[2:04:30] preacher preaching but let me tell you
[2:04:32] something about demons they can't live
[2:04:35] the life they can't produce the life of
[2:04:39] Jesus Christ no matter how hard they try
[2:04:43] it's not in them to live a reproducible
[2:04:46] resurrection it's not in them to
[2:04:48] manifest the attributes of Christ so
[2:04:52] they may holler
[2:04:53] amen and they may feel something but
[2:04:57] that's not what this final test is going
[2:04:59] to be
[2:05:03] about this final test is going to be
[2:05:06] about whether or not you can am in it
[2:05:08] with your
[2:05:09] life cuz there's a lot of pools hello
[2:05:13] there's a lot of pools out there there's
[2:05:15] a lot of apps that people can get on
[2:05:17] their phone there's a lot of access that
[2:05:19] you can have to filth you no longer have
[2:05:22] to walk in the 7-Eleven and buy the
[2:05:24] magazine you no longer have to go down
[2:05:26] to the smut houses to buy the
[2:05:30] junk Amazon will bring you the
[2:05:33] filth your telephone will bring you the
[2:05:36] filth amen your integrity
[2:05:39] matters it's not what you do when you
[2:05:41] get in
[2:05:43] here let's see if we can get some help
[2:05:46] it's what you're doing when nobody's
[2:05:49] looking when nobody sees your account
[2:05:52] when nobody monitors your
[2:05:57] orders you think you think because you
[2:05:59] chose a a a discreet
[2:06:03] shipping come on now I've been told it's
[2:06:06] offered that way if you'd like to get
[2:06:08] your filth you can you can specify let
[2:06:12] it come in in discrete
[2:06:15] packages well that wouldn't do me any
[2:06:17] good if I was trying to cheat like that
[2:06:19] because it don't matter what name is on
[2:06:21] the package in my house if it comes from
[2:06:24] Amazon everybody in the house opens
[2:06:29] it somebody said well how would they do
[2:06:31] that not knowing that they've got an
[2:06:33] order they got an order all of them
[2:06:34] everybody there's hardly ever a time
[2:06:36] that somebody in the house hadn't
[2:06:38] ordered something from Amazon so if I
[2:06:40] was trying to sneak something filthy in
[2:06:42] the
[2:06:43] house you'd think well if it was in your
[2:06:45] name you know you could be oh no no no
[2:06:48] no no no no no I not only have the Holy
[2:06:50] Ghost I got a big old family around me
[2:06:52] all the time checking up on me or
[2:06:55] whatever you might call it afraid that
[2:06:57] it's their package and not come on you
[2:07:00] know the enemy is
[2:07:03] slick it's not because you come over
[2:07:05] here and amen your pastor thank you for
[2:07:08] doing it I need it I'm I'm depending on
[2:07:10] it this morning and always but it's can
[2:07:13] you live this
[2:07:15] [Music]
[2:07:17] life what kind of language are you using
[2:07:20] when nobody's around that knows your
[2:07:22] church
[2:07:27] history what are you guzzling when
[2:07:30] nobody else is
[2:07:33] [Music]
[2:07:36] around what do you drink I've asked
[2:07:38] preach what do you drink on the
[2:07:42] airplane when nobody's
[2:07:44] around we had the spirit of the Lord
[2:07:47] come here one time in the middle of one
[2:07:48] of our camp meetings and call out a
[2:07:49] preacher
[2:07:52] who had been taking a toddy on the
[2:07:56] airplane nobody on the plane knew
[2:08:02] him except the one that matters the
[2:08:05] most but the enemy told him you're under
[2:08:07] pressure you're in stress you know you
[2:08:09] you got nerves and you got a lot going
[2:08:11] on and that'll just take the edge off
[2:08:13] the devil's A sly old
[2:08:17] fox come on here's that Spirit of
[2:08:20] antichrist so much like the real that's
[2:08:23] right so all of you who like to mention
[2:08:25] about how that the Great imans and the
[2:08:28] black popes of of of Islam and and and
[2:08:32] all these uh are going to come along and
[2:08:34] lead the the move of the Antichrist and
[2:08:37] how it's going to be Islam you are so
[2:08:42] fooled it's there there's not a person
[2:08:44] in the right mind that thinks that that
[2:08:47] Islam is so close to Christianity that
[2:08:50] you could almost mix up the the two and
[2:08:53] the scripture said when that Spirit
[2:08:54] comes it's going to be so much like the
[2:08:57] real that even the elect would be
[2:08:59] deceived if it were possible anybody in
[2:09:01] this house that can't tell the
[2:09:02] difference between Islam and
[2:09:03] Christianity you're in bad shape brother
[2:09:06] so it's going to be something even much
[2:09:08] closer than that isn't it it's going to
[2:09:10] be something that talks about Jesus and
[2:09:12] the blood and drinking communion and
[2:09:14] come on it's going to be something very
[2:09:17] close and it's not just going to
[2:09:18] monopolize one church or one
[2:09:20] organization
[2:09:21] that Spirit of course is going to lead
[2:09:23] and that church is going to lead and and
[2:09:26] we understand how political Rome and
[2:09:28] Papal Rome joined together in the last
[2:09:31] days we understand that but if you think
[2:09:34] that's the only place the Antichrist
[2:09:36] spirit is going to
[2:09:39] operate Bible tells us that it's already
[2:09:42] in the earth in the time of the writing
[2:09:43] of the Epistles the spirit of iniquity
[2:09:46] doth already
[2:09:48] work the Bible said and he that now lth
[2:09:51] will let Holy Ghost restrain her until
[2:09:55] he be taken out of the way you think
[2:09:57] your neighbors are insane you think
[2:09:59] people walking around in Walmart in
[2:10:01] their in their boxer shorts are
[2:10:05] insane you think them people walking
[2:10:07] around with holes in every part of their
[2:10:09] body and chains connecting
[2:10:13] them a man and and and something walking
[2:10:17] in with a chain on their nose connected
[2:10:21] do a chain on on on something's
[2:10:25] nose you don't even know what it is you
[2:10:28] think that's insane you haven't seen the
[2:10:32] insanity that's headed to planet
[2:10:36] Earth you're part of the reason that's
[2:10:38] holding it at Bay right now but one of
[2:10:41] these days you and the Holy Ghost are
[2:10:42] getting out of here and when you do
[2:10:45] you're not going to want a front row
[2:10:46] seed to planet Earth in the Bible tells
[2:10:49] us what it I wished I had some
[2:10:52] help the spirit sits in the temple of
[2:10:55] God showing himself that he is God
[2:10:57] remember ye not that when I was with you
[2:10:59] I told you these things and now ye know
[2:11:01] that withholdeth that he might be
[2:11:03] revealed in his time for the mystery of
[2:11:06] iniquity doth already work only he who
[2:11:08] now lth will let until he be taken out
[2:11:11] of the way and then shall that Wicked be
[2:11:13] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[2:11:15] with the spirit of his mouth that's the
[2:11:17] end of this thing and shall destroy with
[2:11:19] the brightness of his coming that's the
[2:11:21] second coming that's not the Rapture
[2:11:23] that's the second coming on the other
[2:11:25] end of the last part of the tribulation
[2:11:28] period when when he's going to come so
[2:11:30] brightly that all the armies of of the
[2:11:33] Antichrist and all the armies of
[2:11:35] Darkness are going to perish at the
[2:11:37] brightness of his coming even him whose
[2:11:39] coming is after the working of Satan
[2:11:41] with all power and signs and lers lying
[2:11:45] wonders and with all deceivableness of
[2:11:47] unrighteousness in them that perish
[2:11:49] because why why why were they so
[2:11:52] vulnerable why did they so easily fall
[2:11:56] victim to the seducing spirits of
[2:11:59] hell because they receive not the love
[2:12:02] of the
[2:12:07] truth I'm going to say it again because
[2:12:10] they received not the love of the truth
[2:12:12] that they might be saved somebody said
[2:12:15] brother Shelley are you really that
[2:12:17] quick to put people out folks I'm not
[2:12:19] even preaching about putting people out
[2:12:21] that has nothing to do with what I'm
[2:12:22] saying I don't see anybody I want to put
[2:12:25] out that's not even in my heart what I
[2:12:28] want to do is make sure that you don't
[2:12:29] follow the slippery
[2:12:36] slope I have no control over what you
[2:12:38] read or what you watch or what you spend
[2:12:42] your time doing but I can tell you this
[2:12:44] right now if you're spending all your
[2:12:46] time watching anti- videos against this
[2:12:49] truth and you're not spending any time
[2:12:51] in the
[2:12:52] word you're not unburdening yourself
[2:12:56] you're fooling yourself that's what
[2:12:59] you're doing because the only way to
[2:13:01] know what's false is to get a better
[2:13:04] look at what's
[2:13:10] real just a minute I'm going to help you
[2:13:13] you're you're just not doing too good
[2:13:14] this morning if I'd have been sitting
[2:13:17] here and someone would have said that
[2:13:18] one I and I was listening to a preacher
[2:13:20] say something that good I here's what
[2:13:22] I'd have done
[2:13:23] wo tell
[2:13:26] it then I no no not now you're late
[2:13:29] you're too late too late keep it I just
[2:13:33] wanted you to know what I'd have
[2:13:34] done because here is how we're built
[2:13:38] there's something on the inside I told
[2:13:40] this Tuesday night let me tell it again
[2:13:41] and move on we got to
[2:13:43] close brother but let me tell this I
[2:13:46] told this Tuesday night maybe you didn't
[2:13:48] understand it so because of all the talk
[2:13:51] it's been going on for years now uh I'm
[2:13:53] a little bit of a
[2:13:57] packrat and a little bit of a collector
[2:14:00] collector is a much nicer word um just
[2:14:03] use that word Jessica if you ever need
[2:14:05] it just say I'm a I'm a I'm a
[2:14:08] collector I use it a
[2:14:10] lot and uh anyway that excuses the junk
[2:14:14] if you're collecting and and brother
[2:14:16] green told me years ago he said you know
[2:14:18] I made it a habit in my life to buy
[2:14:21] every
[2:14:23] book that mentioned brother brandom's
[2:14:26] name and and and he had a whole Library
[2:14:29] there of all the books that mentioned
[2:14:32] I've seen the seen the library don't
[2:14:33] know where it is now but I've seen it
[2:14:37] all the books and magazines and letters
[2:14:40] and things like that that that that he
[2:14:42] could get a hold of that mentioned
[2:14:44] brother bram's name and I said but
[2:14:45] brother green I remember standing there
[2:14:47] in the early
[2:14:48] 90s before his before collection
[2:14:52] expanded because there was a whole lot
[2:14:54] less negative being written back then
[2:14:55] than there is now and I looked there at
[2:14:58] and I said but brother green this book
[2:15:00] right here is very very critical of the
[2:15:04] ministry of brother brandom he said yes
[2:15:05] I don't
[2:15:08] discriminate he said if there's a book
[2:15:10] negative I want to have it too he said I
[2:15:12] ought to know what
[2:15:14] said didn't seem to sway him did it he
[2:15:17] seemed to me to die believing the same
[2:15:20] thing he believed when he started but he
[2:15:22] said look F you don't he said you don't
[2:15:24] have to be afraid of having that in your
[2:15:26] library there uh Steve he said because
[2:15:29] one day somebody might question you on
[2:15:31] that and you may have to stand there in
[2:15:33] front of them and say I have no clue is
[2:15:35] going to make you look like an
[2:15:38] idiot so you may have to have it so I've
[2:15:40] been doing that all these years and uh
[2:15:43] for about 10 years there were so many
[2:15:46] things being written about brother
[2:15:47] brandom in a positive way that I I lost
[2:15:50] track of some of them so many of the
[2:15:52] charismatics and Pentecostals were
[2:15:54] trying to embrace the power that they
[2:15:57] saw in his ministry not what he said of
[2:15:59] course not but they wanted the mantle
[2:16:02] they wanted the power they wanted the
[2:16:04] Miracles they wanted to be able to tell
[2:16:06] people the secrets of their heart so I
[2:16:08] am a little bit behind in that but I
[2:16:10] have bought negative and I've had a b
[2:16:12] over the past two weeks uh just about
[2:16:14] every day Amazon has brought me
[2:16:16] something else negative so I went
[2:16:18] through the boxes and I said I I'm just
[2:16:20] going to to choose one and and try to
[2:16:22] get through it and pray over myself and
[2:16:24] plead the blood of Jesus but I'm going
[2:16:26] to try to get through this book I don't
[2:16:28] suggest that anyone do that unless
[2:16:30] you're spending Ample Ample time in the
[2:16:35] word I feel like I'm doing pretty good
[2:16:38] in that regard not to brag but so I
[2:16:41] thought I would take time to to go
[2:16:43] through some of it and here's here was
[2:16:45] my experience this was a book that
[2:16:47] wanted to point out the unscriptural
[2:16:49] teachings of the message of the
[2:16:52] hour and it's amazing to me that when
[2:16:55] they were trying to prove the
[2:16:56] unscriptural teachings of the message of
[2:16:58] the hour that they left out a whole lot
[2:17:00] of
[2:17:04] verses come on now no no no no no no no
[2:17:07] no when I gave you the teaching on
[2:17:11] Christmas I didn't just come here and
[2:17:13] give you all the negative quotes that
[2:17:14] brother Brandon made did I I brought you
[2:17:17] the positive ones too and anybody in
[2:17:20] their right mind saw that he was more
[2:17:22] against it than for it just by measuring
[2:17:26] the two so I think if you're going to
[2:17:29] present something as unscriptural you
[2:17:31] can't leave out
[2:17:33] scriptures that seem to support what
[2:17:36] you're calling
[2:17:40] unscriptural so so I sit down I don't
[2:17:42] make a big too of it I sit down in my
[2:17:44] broken recliner and I start reading and
[2:17:47] I think I'm going to read this you know
[2:17:49] I'm going to read this like I'm somebody
[2:17:51] I'm going to read this like like
[2:17:53] somebody who's just really examining
[2:17:55] this and I know before it's over I'm
[2:17:57] probably going to find something that's
[2:17:59] going to hurt my feelings a little bit
[2:18:00] but I'll be all right it's not about
[2:18:02] emotion it's about truth so I prepare
[2:18:05] myself and uh the first paragraph I read
[2:18:09] is talking about one of those horrible
[2:18:12] unscriptural unorthodox
[2:18:14] unchristian uh Gnostic type ideas that
[2:18:18] brother Brandon preached that weren't in
[2:18:19] the scripture and and I want you to know
[2:18:21] that the more I read the more excited I
[2:18:29] got because I could clearly see you've
[2:18:32] left out anything remotely
[2:18:35] positive you've only given me the
[2:18:38] negative and even at the end of the day
[2:18:41] that is exactly what I
[2:18:44] believe so if it's Gnostic if it's
[2:18:48] unorthodox if it's not main
[2:18:51] stream on now and you can't even call it
[2:18:55] unscriptural if you leave out the
[2:18:57] scriptures that teach
[2:19:00] it so what I had was fake
[2:19:04] media what I had in my hand was a
[2:19:10] rag and really its value to me is less
[2:19:15] than
[2:19:19] TP do do I I need to help you with
[2:19:26] that Kade you follow me everybody follow
[2:19:29] me that's tissue
[2:19:34] paper cuz I was growing up as I was
[2:19:37] growing up I wasn't allowed to
[2:19:40] say
[2:19:45] toilet I was only allowed to say water
[2:19:48] closet so water closet paper
[2:19:52] that doesn't seem to have quite the
[2:19:54] shock value of TP right it's value to me
[2:19:58] ended up being
[2:20:00] less I wished I had my 20 bucks
[2:20:05] back but I'm a
[2:20:08] collector you you've got to understand
[2:20:13] folks that it doesn't matter what kind
[2:20:16] of a description they hang on it if
[2:20:20] there's something on the inside of the
[2:20:22] inside of the inside of the inside of
[2:20:26] you that says you may not see that in
[2:20:30] the word but I
[2:20:33] do and I can't
[2:20:37] apologize because I see
[2:20:40] it I don't want to
[2:20:43] apologize because I see it I see it
[2:20:48] because I was ordained to see it I see
[2:20:52] it because I was born to see
[2:20:56] [Music]
[2:20:58] it and I can't apologize for
[2:21:01] that so if your families or your
[2:21:04] neighbors want to hang on you a title
[2:21:09] you know uh a
[2:21:12] cult an unorthodox
[2:21:15] Church nonmainstream
[2:21:18] Christianity Church
[2:21:21] don't even let it slow you
[2:21:25] down you can't open somebody else's eyes
[2:21:29] but you'd be a fool to try to close your
[2:21:32] eyes when the Holy Ghost has opened your
[2:21:36] eyes to this
[2:21:40] word it's a dangerous
[2:21:43] slope because we grew up in
[2:21:46] Pentecost taught that if you made fun of
[2:21:50] somebody
[2:21:53] shouting that that was the epitome of
[2:21:58] blasphemy of the Holy
[2:22:00] Ghost brother brandom even said that
[2:22:02] some people have gazed on those who were
[2:22:06] in the
[2:22:07] spirit with some critical judgment some
[2:22:12] harsh you know opinion in their in their
[2:22:15] gazing and he said
[2:22:18] gone he said they've done black
[2:22:20] blasphemed but I want you to know that
[2:22:23] blasphemy of the Holy Ghost is much more
[2:22:26] you don't have to be in a church where
[2:22:28] people shout or jump or run around to
[2:22:31] blaspheme the Holy Ghost the basic
[2:22:35] biblical definition of the only
[2:22:39] sin that is
[2:22:42] unpardonable you know it's not it's not
[2:22:46] divorce it's not it's not being married
[2:22:49] twice
[2:22:51] that's not God's original plan I'm not
[2:22:54] going to pretend like it is it's not I'm
[2:22:55] not ashamed to tell you it's not God's
[2:22:57] plan but that's not an unpardonable
[2:23:00] sin or homosexuality is hard for us to
[2:23:05] comprehend
[2:23:07] it it's not an unpardonable sin it's
[2:23:11] sick but it's not
[2:23:13] unpardonable and I'll be honest with you
[2:23:15] a man that lays down with a dozen
[2:23:17] different women is just as sick to me
[2:23:20] that's right I'm not trying to defend
[2:23:23] either or I'm just telling you you you
[2:23:25] don't have to be uh somehow involved
[2:23:27] with the same gender for to be
[2:23:31] filthy oh come on
[2:23:34] preacher tell
[2:23:35] us you don't have to buy my
[2:23:43] lunch but there is a
[2:23:45] sin that Jesus said is not going to be
[2:23:48] forgiven you in this world or the world
[2:23:50] to come
[2:23:52] blasphemy sins against the Holy Spirit
[2:23:55] and what that is from scriptural uh uh
[2:23:58] definition is attributing the works of
[2:24:04] God to the
[2:24:06] devil giving
[2:24:08] credit to the devil for what God has
[2:24:14] done doesn't that sound a whole lot
[2:24:16] easier to do than just mocking somebody
[2:24:18] who's running up there
[2:24:21] I'm just telling you what the Bible
[2:24:22] teaches us it means so we need to be
[2:24:26] very careful what we say it matters what
[2:24:29] we say it matters what we believe are
[2:24:32] you helping me preach it
[2:24:36] matters who we give
[2:24:39] credit for what we see happening among
[2:24:42] us to say that was the devil when indeed
[2:24:45] it was God doing it because God doesn't
[2:24:48] often have to explain himself to you or
[2:24:51] me we know that he works in the
[2:24:54] perimeters of his
[2:24:56] word but we know that he is uh he is
[2:25:00] only bound to his character to his
[2:25:02] attributes to who he is we know that
[2:25:06] there are things that God is capable of
[2:25:08] that are not
[2:25:11] recorded oh where'd you get that from
[2:25:13] the
[2:25:14] gospels the Bible tells us that the
[2:25:16] world could not contain the volume of
[2:25:19] the books
[2:25:20] if everything that Jesus accomplished in
[2:25:23] his Earthly Ministry were recorded on
[2:25:24] paper the whole world wouldn't hold the
[2:25:26] book so that means there are things that
[2:25:29] God is capable of that we may not have
[2:25:31] verse and chapter for so we should be
[2:25:35] very careful how we call the things of
[2:25:42] God of the
[2:25:45] devil very very careful because the
[2:25:47] enemy wants to fool us oh oh thank God
[2:25:51] we don't have to fear amen if it were
[2:25:56] possible I I heard um I Heard the one of
[2:26:00] the services at the youth camp in Ohio
[2:26:03] this week and I heard uh uh a young
[2:26:06] Pastor say something very powerful he
[2:26:10] was talking he was preaching a message
[2:26:11] called impossible it's
[2:26:14] impossible and and and while I might not
[2:26:16] agree with everything that I heard I
[2:26:18] know that it is commonly accepted
[2:26:21] teaching around the
[2:26:22] message but what really struck me was
[2:26:26] this concept of being able to
[2:26:31] fall and get back up that's
[2:26:36] biblical very
[2:26:37] biblical the prophet tells us from the
[2:26:40] word we can fall we can fail we can
[2:26:44] slide
[2:26:46] away that doesn't mean we're lost
[2:26:50] that's right I need you to know that you
[2:26:53] don't have to say amen I just need to
[2:26:55] know that you know that it's important
[2:26:58] for me to know that you know that and we
[2:27:01] can change our
[2:27:04] mind what we fight today we might
[2:27:08] Embrace
[2:27:09] tomorrow but we better make sure that
[2:27:11] we're embracing what the word says
[2:27:14] correct you see there was a time I
[2:27:17] became so overwhelmed
[2:27:20] with the life and the behavior of those
[2:27:24] who claimed this
[2:27:27] truth that I boxed up the
[2:27:31] tapes and I put them in the top of the
[2:27:34] closet and I said I don't want anything
[2:27:37] else to do with that because if
[2:27:40] that produces
[2:27:42] this
[2:27:44] right now that was very unfair of
[2:27:48] me but I did it and I'm not lost and I
[2:27:53] didn't
[2:27:54] blaspheme because God saw my heart and
[2:27:58] he knew that you can't judge a
[2:28:01] truth
[2:28:02] only by the people who claim to follow
[2:28:05] it because if that were the case
[2:28:08] Christianity is a
[2:28:12] shame if we judge
[2:28:16] Jesus by the quacks that follow him
[2:28:21] say they say they follow
[2:28:27] him if if
[2:28:30] if if we could judge Jesus by by uh
[2:28:34] those who carry the Bible under their
[2:28:37] arm and say we're standing on the word
[2:28:40] if if we could judge Jesus by those uh
[2:28:43] uh uh uh nearly senseless
[2:28:47] people who stand across the street
[2:28:51] mocking dead
[2:28:53] soldiers in the name of Baptist
[2:28:58] Church mocking moms and dads who go to
[2:29:01] bury their soldiers telling them they
[2:29:04] died in vain supporting America and
[2:29:07] they're screaming in
[2:29:10] Hell or who go to funerals of people
[2:29:13] that have been murdered because they
[2:29:15] were practicing a homosexual lifestyle
[2:29:19] and were murdered for that and this
[2:29:21] Christian church with Baptist stuck on
[2:29:23] their name go there and scream at people
[2:29:26] coming to the funeral and tell them
[2:29:28] they're all going to hell and and that
[2:29:30] the gay person deserved hell and should
[2:29:32] have died and gone to hell and they do
[2:29:34] it in the name of Jesus and they put on
[2:29:36] their signs scriptures if
[2:29:40] that is a reflection of Jesus or the
[2:29:44] Bible I really wouldn't want any part of
[2:29:46] that would you cuz that's not how Jesus
[2:29:48] ministered to the sick and need
[2:29:51] hello but we're not going to hold Jesus
[2:29:54] responsible or accountable for everybody
[2:29:57] that names his name and we can hold this
[2:30:01] message responsible for all the quacks
[2:30:04] and the
[2:30:07] idolators that some of us have met
[2:30:10] through the
[2:30:11] years because in the midst of all that
[2:30:13] chaos and confusion and messed up folk
[2:30:17] there is a remnant bride that is held on
[2:30:21] to the word that is held on to the truth
[2:30:25] of the
[2:30:26] message there's a remnant bride who's
[2:30:30] not following this word because of a
[2:30:33] cloud or because of a bridge or because
[2:30:36] of some other sign or wonder we follow
[2:30:40] it because it lines up with the Bible
[2:30:44] the absolute word of God you'll never
[2:30:50] ever defeat the Devil with a picture of
[2:30:52] William brandom but you can defeat him
[2:30:55] every time with the word of
[2:31:00] God you'd be foolish to try to hold up
[2:31:03] your pastor's picture and say look at
[2:31:07] there
[2:31:08] devil why he'd eat you and I both for
[2:31:11] lunch if he could don't be mad please
[2:31:14] folks don't fall into stupidity in this
[2:31:18] last hour
[2:31:22] somebody said well this you know that
[2:31:24] couldn't be a real Church a message
[2:31:25] couldn't be a real one cuz they don't
[2:31:27] have Brother brandom's
[2:31:34] picture I I've got one in my office if
[2:31:37] you need to see
[2:31:39] it but when you come
[2:31:43] here we didn't start out all those years
[2:31:45] ago to build a church where you could
[2:31:47] sit while the preacher was preaching and
[2:31:49] stare somebody who's not with us
[2:31:53] anymore you
[2:31:56] might you don't have to be here Tuesday
[2:31:59] night my bills are almost paid for this
[2:32:04] month my big payments are out of the
[2:32:08] way you might also notice you don't see
[2:32:10] a picture of
[2:32:13] Jesus if you were if we were
[2:32:16] catholic we'd make sure to put Jesus up
[2:32:19] there and and apostles and mother Mary
[2:32:21] and brother brandom
[2:32:24] and somebody said well there was a
[2:32:27] crucifix on the pull pit at the brandom
[2:32:29] Tabernacle why don't you have a crucifix
[2:32:31] on here because for any of you that
[2:32:34] don't know the
[2:32:37] news he ain't on the
[2:32:44] [Music]
[2:32:45] cross somebody said where is he in
[2:32:48] heaven no
[2:32:53] Hallelujah I know where Jesus is he's
[2:32:57] living in his wife he's living and
[2:33:02] breathing and moving in his
[2:33:06] bride he's the same yesterday today and
[2:33:13] forever he's not a historical
[2:33:17] document he's a living
[2:33:21] [Applause]
[2:33:25] reality thank you I might say much
[2:33:31] better in the message Discerning the
[2:33:33] body of the Lord Chaka
[2:33:37] Ohio Jesus said as it were in the days
[2:33:40] as it was in the days of Sodom the
[2:33:42] police and the homicides and all that
[2:33:44] just go on the go all the time breaking
[2:33:46] up boys living together as husband and
[2:33:48] wife women living the the same way
[2:33:50] perverted their minds their filthy Minds
[2:33:55] because they don't
[2:34:00] have all is a lust and a filth and they
[2:34:04] can't satisfy themselves
[2:34:06] listen even with one
[2:34:09] another they don't even marry that's an
[2:34:12] hour we're living in they don't even
[2:34:14] marry they just take up and go out until
[2:34:17] they're perverted and Jesus said that
[2:34:19] would be in the last days and here it
[2:34:23] is claiming some binary thing and my
[2:34:27] pronouns are are are they and
[2:34:31] them and I hope you jump through all the
[2:34:34] Hoops to try to keep from offending
[2:34:37] somebody on their pronouns but I want
[2:34:39] you to know I'm just too
[2:34:43] old I am not about to now start
[2:34:47] tiptoeing Through the Tulips to try to
[2:34:49] call somebody they and
[2:34:54] them and when we were buying a CH
[2:34:57] child's garment something for Elana and
[2:35:00] the little little uh thank you son the
[2:35:03] little
[2:35:06] clerk uses a plural pronoun to refer to
[2:35:10] a single child because she doesn't want
[2:35:12] to offend Us in case we're not one of
[2:35:15] those who choose to hang a gender on a
[2:35:18] baby when it's born have you lost your
[2:35:20] mind we happen to know it's a girl we
[2:35:23] check the we check the radar what do you
[2:35:27] call it we checked the ultrasound and we
[2:35:30] could see the
[2:35:34] plumbing and we know right now without a
[2:35:37] doubt that that's exactly what it's
[2:35:39] going to be a girl and she's going to be
[2:35:41] raised to be a girl and I I believe with
[2:35:44] all my heart she's going to be raised
[2:35:46] right and godly and whole and a and I
[2:35:49] don't think I don't know but from what I
[2:35:51] understand from the parents you're not
[2:35:53] going to see Brit's
[2:35:57] owner not even
[2:36:01] now because we wouldn't want her to grow
[2:36:04] up and look back and say how come it was
[2:36:06] all
[2:36:07] right that's how the message people do
[2:36:09] it these days but I want you to know in
[2:36:11] 1988 899 91 92
[2:36:14] 993 they didn't do it that
[2:36:18] way believe women in this message didn't
[2:36:21] wear pajamas then either and if they did
[2:36:23] if they did they certainly didn't tell
[2:36:25] it because they saw a little verse there
[2:36:27] they said whoa I'm about to lose my
[2:36:30] breath just a
[2:36:32] [Music]
[2:36:35] minute somebody get me some oxygen and
[2:36:37] an
[2:36:38] IV I'm going to preach on a
[2:36:43] minute CU some little godly woman some
[2:36:46] little Godly Man read a verse that said
[2:36:49] that even that which
[2:36:54] pertaineth somebody said well I don't
[2:36:56] buy mine in the men's department I I buy
[2:36:59] them in the women's Department that's
[2:37:00] not that's not what the scripture was
[2:37:02] talking about which department do you
[2:37:04] buy it in the scripture was talking
[2:37:06] about what pertains
[2:37:09] to you'd be shocked out of your socks if
[2:37:12] I if I if I brought me a skirt yeah I
[2:37:14] saw something in Target last night oh
[2:37:17] don't tell anybody I was in Target on a
[2:37:19] Saturday night ton
[2:37:20] night I saw something in Target last
[2:37:22] night looked like a dress in the men's
[2:37:25] department some kind of hood some kind
[2:37:28] of uh I'll get in a minute pullover
[2:37:32] thing that went way down to there didn't
[2:37:34] it didn't it went way down to there and
[2:37:37] had a zipper down it and kind of chamber
[2:37:40] or something kind of just popular Lo and
[2:37:44] they they and they'll sell it they will
[2:37:46] sell it right here in the Bible Belt
[2:37:50] they will sell
[2:37:51] it and some old twist and will buy
[2:37:55] it come
[2:37:56] on and dare you to say anything about
[2:38:01] it but I don't have to do it because
[2:38:05] they do that that certainly looked to me
[2:38:08] like it pertained to a woman and I
[2:38:09] didn't want no part of it and a sister
[2:38:12] who wants to follow the lord she's
[2:38:14] looking for those things that still
[2:38:16] matter somebody said that's Old
[2:38:17] Testament the problem with that is I
[2:38:19] told you Tuesday night is that little
[2:38:21] line that says to to blend to to confuse
[2:38:25] the genders it's an Abomination unto the
[2:38:28] Lord he said it that means it doesn't
[2:38:30] change what he if he hated that kind of
[2:38:32] thing then he hates it now come on it's
[2:38:35] a spirit of delusion it's a seducing
[2:38:38] spirit I know it's
[2:38:40] [Music]
[2:38:43] quiet now I I uh have just just a very
[2:38:47] few minutes left 1 John chapter 4 this
[2:38:51] was really the meat of what I wanted to
[2:38:52] say and I won't be able to say it today
[2:38:54] but I'll I'll pick this up Tuesday night
[2:38:57] 1 John 4 1-3 beloved believe not every
[2:39:04] Spirit somebody will say I feel it in my
[2:39:11] spirit that's not always something we
[2:39:13] can
[2:39:15] trust because there's doorways into this
[2:39:17] inner Inner Man and these things can
[2:39:20] affect us mind will and emotions can
[2:39:22] affect us come on and memories and
[2:39:26] imaginations and conscience and
[2:39:28] affections and reasonings they can
[2:39:30] affect us in the Inner Man so we can't
[2:39:33] believe every little unction or every
[2:39:34] little feeling or every little spirit
[2:39:36] that tries to move us but the Bible said
[2:39:38] try the
[2:39:40] spirits whether they are of God how will
[2:39:43] we be able to do that because we have an
[2:39:46] absolute
[2:39:47] word that's right
[2:39:50] somebody said but what about all those
[2:39:51] people preaching out of the same book
[2:39:53] preaching this lie or that lie or the
[2:39:56] other lie that's why you need the Holy
[2:39:59] Ghost you need to know that you know
[2:40:02] that you know that you've had more than
[2:40:03] a goosebump you've had more than a tear
[2:40:05] you've had More Than A Feeling because
[2:40:07] that Holy Spirit will lead you back to
[2:40:09] the word every time every time every
[2:40:12] time and God will put the truth in your
[2:40:15] path I'm telling you this is what is
[2:40:17] such a blessing to me when you think
[2:40:20] you've got a handle on it if God sees
[2:40:22] that you don't have it all he he sends
[2:40:25] the same Holy Spirit pulls that same
[2:40:27] Holy Spirit up out of your life and
[2:40:29] takes you a little deeper a little
[2:40:31] further in the truth God leads his dear
[2:40:33] children along many of us came through
[2:40:36] all kinds of denominational experiences
[2:40:39] to get to where we are
[2:40:40] today and if there was any possibility
[2:40:43] that more truth would come I'd like to
[2:40:45] follow that as well
[2:40:50] and a man who says they wouldn't there's
[2:40:52] something wrong with that man believe
[2:40:54] not every Spirit but try the spirits
[2:40:56] whether they of God because many false
[2:40:58] prophets are gone out into the world
[2:41:00] hereby know ye the spirit of God every
[2:41:03] spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ
[2:41:05] is come in the flesh is of God now you
[2:41:09] may think that everybody believes that
[2:41:11] in christiandom but I want you to know
[2:41:13] they simply do
[2:41:16] not you can take John 1 and tell some
[2:41:19] body in the beginning was the word and
[2:41:20] the Word was made flesh and the Word was
[2:41:23] God and some people will walk away with
[2:41:25] two and three
[2:41:28] people but you can read that to a part
[2:41:30] of this little bride and when they begin
[2:41:32] to have their eyes Anointed with Isa it
[2:41:34] don't matter how many how many voices
[2:41:36] spoke out of heaven and how many doves
[2:41:38] flew by and how many prayers he uttered
[2:41:41] in the garden none of that really
[2:41:42] matters to them because all they can see
[2:41:45] is one God manifesting himself in many
[2:41:48] different ways
[2:41:51] we can't see nothing
[2:41:53] else somebody said I'd love to see the
[2:41:55] Trinity well I wish you could if you
[2:41:57] want to see it that bad but you're going
[2:41:58] to have to look at the church and not
[2:42:00] the book if you look at the word all of
[2:42:06] it every spirit that confesses not that
[2:42:08] Jesus has come in the flesh is not of
[2:42:10] God I'm nearly done but I don't have to
[2:42:12] stop it's not 2 o'
[2:42:15] yet we're into Sunday night now folks
[2:42:18] you don't even have to find some where
[2:42:19] to go to church tonight this is Sunday
[2:42:20] night right now we've done left Sunday
[2:42:23] morning and this is the spirit of
[2:42:25] antichrist listen and every spirit that
[2:42:27] confesses not that Jesus Christ has come
[2:42:29] in the flesh is not of God and this is
[2:42:32] that Spirit of antichrist whereof ye
[2:42:34] have heard that it should come and even
[2:42:36] now already is it in the world I just
[2:42:39] had a flashback of being with sister
[2:42:42] pericet a Nigerian a Spirit-filled nun
[2:42:46] friend of mine see I don't hate
[2:42:48] Catholics
[2:42:51] she was a friend of mine good friend and
[2:42:54] of Jonathan's we loved
[2:42:56] her she loved us she loved him I'm
[2:43:00] easier to love than Jonathan but she
[2:43:03] loved both of
[2:43:04] us and she helps us get into the church
[2:43:07] of of uh the Nativity in
[2:43:11] Bethlehem and we're walking through
[2:43:13] there with the nun folks we were just
[2:43:15] chopping in high
[2:43:17] cotton everybody was just just greeting
[2:43:19] us like we
[2:43:20] were representatives of the Vatican they
[2:43:23] thought we were visiting from
[2:43:27] Rome we passed the little cabinet where
[2:43:29] the Holy Eucharist is
[2:43:32] kept that's the way for
[2:43:35] God that's the round wafer God that
[2:43:38] they've prayed over and dedicated it and
[2:43:39] called it
[2:43:41] Jesus when sister pericle she bows and
[2:43:44] she starts signing the cross and I asked
[2:43:46] her what in word are you doing
[2:43:49] and she wants us to know in case we
[2:43:51] wanted to join her in in in in in
[2:43:54] stooping down to pay homage to the
[2:43:59] bread now I've been mighty hungry and
[2:44:01] I've been mighty thankful for bread
[2:44:04] before but not in the same context as
[2:44:06] she wanted us to be she said now if the
[2:44:09] priest has already blessed that she said
[2:44:11] that's not just bread that's
[2:44:14] God I said now sister that's where you
[2:44:17] and I are going to have to strongly
[2:44:20] disagree what I wanted to tell her in
[2:44:22] fact I did tell her later what you
[2:44:24] should have done was showed your respect
[2:44:27] to
[2:44:29] me and then let me show my respect I
[2:44:32] wasn't going to do that to her but let
[2:44:34] me show my respect to her because if
[2:44:36] you're filled with the life of
[2:44:38] God you're more than a hunk of
[2:44:41] Flesh you're also the spirit of the
[2:44:44] Living God walking around people want to
[2:44:47] pay respect they want want to worship
[2:44:49] something so bad that they make a
[2:44:52] chalice of wine blood and a piece of
[2:44:55] bread body when all they have to do is
[2:44:58] recognize that he wasn't looking for a
[2:45:00] piece of bread to live in or a chalice
[2:45:03] of wine he was looking for a
[2:45:08] house in you and
[2:45:10] I we are the
[2:45:16] temple that Spirit has already come he
[2:45:19] said and now is already in the
[2:45:21] world in
[2:45:23] closing I want to introduce the subject
[2:45:26] for Tuesday
[2:45:27] night we've covered that first two
[2:45:32] Spirits maybe not good but we've
[2:45:35] scratched the surface musicians are
[2:45:37] coming the seducing Spirit which often
[2:45:40] manifests itself telling a lie the
[2:45:43] problem with the LI there's always going
[2:45:44] to be a smattering of Truth there to
[2:45:47] make it believable
[2:45:50] is that right are you
[2:45:53] asleep number two a religious spirit
[2:45:56] that comes in waves of delusion
[2:45:59] sometime you know it's the same kind of
[2:46:02] devil that makes people think a woman
[2:46:04] think that because her hair is long and
[2:46:06] her skirt is long that she's right with
[2:46:08] God that's a delusion that's a religious
[2:46:14] spirit you can dress her up and put her
[2:46:16] on a dress and make her hair long and
[2:46:19] and she can be pale as a ghost and all
[2:46:21] those different things I believe in
[2:46:23] Holiness but that doesn't
[2:46:26] mean her uniform is not what identifies
[2:46:29] her as a real True Blood Bought spirit
[2:46:32] filled child of
[2:46:36] God if a if the length of a skirt made
[2:46:39] someone and I I do wish you sisters
[2:46:42] would make them longer instead of
[2:46:45] shorter but if that was the case then
[2:46:48] you you've got now this this year is
[2:46:50] going to be a trend again for long
[2:46:51] skirts you know and uh of course they're
[2:46:55] split all the way
[2:46:57] up to the crotch can I say that in the
[2:46:59] pull pit I just
[2:47:00] did but they're
[2:47:03] long if the length is what made someone
[2:47:05] a Christian then all youd have to do is
[2:47:07] go down there and buy you one of them
[2:47:09] it's not that's not
[2:47:11] it if talking in tongues is what made
[2:47:14] you a
[2:47:15] Christian then anybody could start
[2:47:17] making some rattling sounds on their
[2:47:19] tongue it's the
[2:47:22] life it's the
[2:47:24] life it's the life and then number three
[2:47:27] on Tuesday night I think you'll want to
[2:47:29] I really think you'll want to hear to be
[2:47:32] a part of this teaching starting Tuesday
[2:47:34] night we're going to start talking about
[2:47:36] the last of those three Spirits it's a
[2:47:37] familiar
[2:47:39] spirit and I think that if God says the
[2:47:42] bride's going to have to deal with
[2:47:43] familiar spirits in the last days I
[2:47:45] think we ought to know what we're coming
[2:47:46] up against it's not just a spirit of WI
[2:47:48] witchcraft because when we think of
[2:47:50] Witchcraft we think of witches and
[2:47:52] crystal balls and black cats and hats
[2:47:55] and and we think of darthy and and Toto
[2:47:58] and come
[2:47:59] on but it's much more than that the
[2:48:03] Bible tells us that we can be stubborn
[2:48:05] and
[2:48:07] rebellious not calling on demons not
[2:48:10] praying to the dead but he said you've
[2:48:13] got that kind of spirit on you that's
[2:48:14] witchcraft
[2:48:16] too a spirit of
[2:48:19] control where you're trying to control
[2:48:22] everyone around
[2:48:24] you that can also be a witchcraft Spirit
[2:48:29] manipulation and coercion and I'm going
[2:48:32] to make that so real to you over the
[2:48:34] next two Services if the Lord allows
[2:48:37] that you're going to recognize that
[2:48:39] sometimes those Spirits like to hang
[2:48:41] around us because we have remained
[2:48:43] underneath the curse of that
[2:48:45] generational iniquity but if we can
[2:48:47] re-identify ourselves this Blood Bought
[2:48:49] children of God and quit telling
[2:48:52] everybody that that Grandma had sugar
[2:48:57] diabetes so I guess I have to have
[2:49:00] it and mama was jealous so that's why
[2:49:03] I'm
[2:49:04] jealous come on if we start
[2:49:07] reidentifying ourselves as New
[2:49:10] Creations when you're born again of the
[2:49:13] spirit of God you have the ability to
[2:49:15] break
[2:49:16] free hey
[2:49:21] somebody said it runs in my family it
[2:49:24] runs in my family it runs in my family
[2:49:27] Pride runs in my family why don't you
[2:49:29] keep passing it on to your to your
[2:49:31] children
[2:49:32] then come on now stubbornness runs in my
[2:49:36] f why don't you just pass it on down
[2:49:38] then if not if you don't want that then
[2:49:41] why don't you raise up and say I am a
[2:49:43] new creation in Christ I'm no longer
[2:49:47] identified with gener ational iniquities
[2:49:50] curses
[2:49:51] diseases
[2:49:54] Tendencies
[2:49:56] addictions my old life is dead in Christ
[2:50:00] I'm living in the new life of Salvation
[2:50:03] bought with a price filled with the life
[2:50:05] of God I don't have to be what mama was
[2:50:09] or what Daddy was or grandma or Uncle
[2:50:12] Joe I can be what God created me to
[2:50:17] be until we come woo we got to go got to
[2:50:20] go until we come to our new identity in
[2:50:24] Christ we may find Spirits hanging
[2:50:28] around our lives that have become so
[2:50:31] familiar to us that we don't even
[2:50:35] recognize them as
[2:50:37] demonic we sometimes call them our
[2:50:40] way our
[2:50:43] nature that's who I am that's how I act
[2:50:48] you just have to take me or leave me if
[2:50:51] you can't accept me for who I am that's
[2:50:53] a that is a rotten sorry lie that the
[2:50:57] devil destroys marriages
[2:51:00] with you didn't get married to stay who
[2:51:03] you
[2:51:05] were if you liked who you were how
[2:51:08] preach brother if you liked who you were
[2:51:12] so much before you got married why
[2:51:15] didn't you stay single
[2:51:19] you don't get married to stay who you
[2:51:21] are that's just my way that's my mama's
[2:51:24] way that's my Grandmama's way I'm just
[2:51:27] like my
[2:51:29] daddy she didn't marry your
[2:51:33] daddy she married you and if you didn't
[2:51:36] hope to
[2:51:42] grow if you didn't hope to grow why do
[2:51:45] you want to drag somebody else into your
[2:51:47] dysfunction that's
[2:51:50] right why do you want to take some poor
[2:51:52] girl that don't know no better and drag
[2:51:54] her into your dysfunctioning
[2:51:59] mess you wanted to
[2:52:01] grow you you wanted to form a new family
[2:52:04] you don't have to be under the family
[2:52:06] you came from this is this don't mean
[2:52:08] you mistreat your loved
[2:52:10] ones you you don't you don't stay away
[2:52:12] from them cuz I don't want to be like
[2:52:14] them that's not how you deal with that
[2:52:15] stuff you deal with it in the altar you
[2:52:17] deal with it in in your devotional life
[2:52:19] you deal with it in prayer you apply the
[2:52:22] word you command that familiar Spirit to
[2:52:25] get out of your life and quit trying to
[2:52:27] make your marriage as dysfunctional as
[2:52:29] your parents
[2:52:32] was well I just don't know how to treat
[2:52:34] a woman my daddy didn't know how to
[2:52:36] treat a woman my Grandmama didn't know
[2:52:37] how come on so what happens is demons
[2:52:40] hear these kinds of confessions and they
[2:52:42] draw near Believers I showed you in the
[2:52:45] message I showed you the difference
[2:52:46] between possession and oppression
[2:52:49] as long as they're on the outside that's
[2:52:51] one thing if they're on the inside
[2:52:53] that's possession and that's another
[2:52:54] level of Deliverance required to get you
[2:52:56] free but as long as you're just feeding
[2:52:58] them
[2:53:01] pie you can just save the
[2:53:04] pie and send them on their way look
[2:53:08] folks as long as you entertain a
[2:53:11] devil it'll hang out and drink your
[2:53:14] Kool-Aid but when you put it on its way
[2:53:18] so commit yourself therefore unto God
[2:53:20] resist the devil and he
[2:53:23] will the reason why they don't flee is
[2:53:26] because we welcome them we have become
[2:53:28] so even as Believers we have become so
[2:53:31] familiar with these Spirits that's right
[2:53:33] that we think it's just our personality
[2:53:36] it's just our nature you know I got my
[2:53:38] granny's
[2:53:44] temper give it back to
[2:53:47] Granny brother
[2:53:49] if she's no longer alive drive over
[2:53:51] there to the funeral home roll your
[2:53:53] window down I mean to the cemetery and
[2:53:55] drive your driver right up there next to
[2:53:58] her grave roll your window down and say
[2:54:00] you dirty devil get out of my
[2:54:04] car you're not going to ride another
[2:54:07] Mile with me I'm taking you back to my
[2:54:11] dear old
[2:54:13] granny you're looking at me like I've
[2:54:15] lost my
[2:54:16] mind do what whatever it takes y'all
[2:54:20] didn't mind when the Kendrick Brothers
[2:54:22] come out with the movie of a woman
[2:54:25] sweeping the devil out of her
[2:54:28] house you cheered you
[2:54:32] cheered here's a black woman about to
[2:54:35] end a generational iniquity that has
[2:54:39] possessed men in her life it's now on
[2:54:43] her husband who is a cheat and a liar
[2:54:47] and is trying to affect and Destroy her
[2:54:49] home so she
[2:54:51] prays but she does more than pray she
[2:54:54] goes opens the door I've done
[2:54:58] it I might do it today I've done it and
[2:55:03] she opens the door and she just tells
[2:55:05] the devil no
[2:55:09] more and you
[2:55:11] cheered but I told you to go down to the
[2:55:13] cemetery and roll your window down and
[2:55:14] tell that Spirit to hang out with Granny
[2:55:16] because you don't want it no more
[2:55:18] and you looked at me like I've just fell
[2:55:20] off a turnup truck on now it may not
[2:55:24] require that but do whatever you have to
[2:55:27] do to start reidentifying yourself as a
[2:55:30] new creature in
[2:55:35] Christ I wouldn't even if I were you and
[2:55:38] my marriage had ended in a in a in a not
[2:55:40] not nice way I wouldn't refer to myself
[2:55:43] as a divorce I'll be honest with you I
[2:55:45] wouldn't even write it on the
[2:55:47] application if I were you
[2:55:51] I wouldn't unless unless you were
[2:55:54] applying for something that was going to
[2:55:55] make a difference I'd say single that
[2:55:58] don't mean single and looking it means
[2:56:00] I'm not
[2:56:02] attached why do people want to get hung
[2:56:04] in some kind of definition of who they
[2:56:06] are I'm a I'm a I'm a I don't I don't

[3:02:24] pastor you get it in your
[3:02:27] mind I've seen more sorrow lately than
[3:02:30] I've ever seen I can hardly make it I
[3:02:33] can hardly get up folks that is not who
[3:02:36] you
[3:02:37] are that's what's happened in your life
[3:02:41] I'm not trying to diminish it every
[3:02:44] family in this church has known pain and
[3:02:46] loss every family in this church has
[3:02:49] known sorrow and heartache and problems
[3:02:52] and troubles and job squeezes and so
[3:02:54] forth but it's not who we are
[3:02:58] hello you don't need somebody else to
[3:03:01] feel sorry for you to validate what you
[3:03:04] feel what you need is to sing this song
[3:03:08] to the top of your lungs and let every
[3:03:13] devil in hell hear you singing it's his
[3:03:17] goodness
[3:03:20] in the midst of my Horror in the midst
[3:03:23] of my sorrow in the midst of my loss in
[3:03:26] the midst of watching my my investment

[3:04:01] Heritage do you understand you can
[3:04:03] always encourage
[3:04:07] yourself the Bible tells us to we're
[3:04:11] mostly waiting on somebody else to
[3:04:13] encourage us but the Bible tells us we
[3:04:16] can encourage ourselves we can pray in
[3:04:18] the Holy Ghost I think that's why the
[3:04:21] devil doesn't want message people
[3:04:23] praying in
[3:04:24] tongues right is because he knows
[3:04:27] there's power when you start praying in
[3:04:30] another language it's bypassing hell
[3:04:33] it's bypassing the imps it's going
[3:04:35] straight into the will right up into the
[3:04:38] presence of God when we know not how to
[3:04:41] pray as we ought he makes intercession
[3:04:43] for us come on now you have the ability
