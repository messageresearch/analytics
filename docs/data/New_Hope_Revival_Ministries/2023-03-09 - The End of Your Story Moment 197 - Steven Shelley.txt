Description:
The Bible tells us that despite the challenges, Abraham never wavered in his faith in God's promise. This inspires hope in us, as we see that even Abraham struggled at times. However, because God had a promise for Abraham's life, nothing could take him before his time. This same finished story is true for all of us. The key to success is to follow in Abraham's footsteps and continually turn back to God, seeking His guidance and strength.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
he knew the choices that you would make the good ones and the dumbless [Music] and the Bible in the New Testament says that Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith [Music] gives me hope [Music] it's me a glorious hope because God gave us a back story about Abraham and my natural eyes see that Abraham staggered some my natural eyes see that Abraham made mistakes natural I see and read that Abraham lied to rulers to Kings somebody that could have took his head off but because that the promise of God was upon Abraham's life his life could not be taken before its time cause there was a promise that had to be fulfilled in Abraham's life and even though my natural mind my reading and and comprehension of the backstory it looks like that Abraham made all kinds of mistakes it looks like that he did not trust the promise of God it looks like he went astray it looks like that he lied and he told all kinds of stories about Sarah being his sister and this kind of thing to to cause people to be deceived or to let be led astray yet God comes over in the New Testament says Abraham staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief you have this same finished story I have this same finished story prefix destiny by God's foreknowledge he Those whom he foreknew he could predestinate or give a prefix Destiny he already knew by his foreknowledge he knew your choice he knew the choices that you would make the good ones and the dumbness [Music] the lovely ones and the ugly ones he knew all of those decisions but he knew that the ultimate decision that you would make would be to follow him and because of that ultimate decision of you saying yes Lord he could give you a prefix destiny and he could line out a path for you that would intertwine with all of these people sitting here and he could at the end of your story say as he did Abraham he staggered not at the promise do I fail yes do you fail yes do you make mistakes yes but the key is you keep coming back as Abraham did to El Shaddai [Music]
