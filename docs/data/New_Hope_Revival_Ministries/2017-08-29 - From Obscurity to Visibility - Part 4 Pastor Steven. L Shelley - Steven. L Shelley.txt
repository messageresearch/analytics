TRANSCRIPT
========================================
praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry I want to welcome you to the program today and thank you for tuning in and I hope perhaps that you're one who watches each and every week on this great Christian network but if perchance this is your first time and I want to welcome you and I want to just tell you what our heart is our heart is to preach to present teach I guess you could hardly call it preaching because we're not standing behind a pulpit but we're sitting here in this chair teaching sharing our heart and the vision is to help prepare and equip you for the great move of the Spirit of God that's coming upon this earth just before the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ we believe that we're moving into the days of the kingdom and we are so grateful to God for how he has opened up the doors for us to be able to reach you by satellite television perhaps you're watching this as a podcast and if that be the case then we want to thank the Lord for that technology as well what a wonderful way for us to be able to send to you an episode of the Eagles cry that you can download onto your computer and even download right onto an mp3 mp4 player and watch it listen any time well we just believe that as we move in to that direction they're going to be many wonderful things taking place and you can keep up with what's going on at New Hope revival ministries by visiting our web page at revival dot o-r-g revival dot org if you prefer to contact us by mail then the address is given to you at the bottom of the screen and we're even willing to take your phone calls now we're here during regular business hours in our part of the world so you're gonna have to make some adjustments to know exactly the right time if you choose to call but we'd be happy to hear from you we're getting prayer Qwest almost on a daily basis and we've been asking for prayer requests for long enough now that we're beginning to get praise reports we're beginning to get testimonies of how the Lord is answering prayer in fact today not necessarily this testimony didn't come because of the Eagles cry but just because of the ministry that the Lord has given us in general but I heard from a mother just today who sent in a prayer request a family that I met many years ago sent in a prayer request for a son that was addicted to drugs very serious drugs and it just seemed like he was going down for the last count and she sent in a prayer request we all sincerely joined with her in prayer and she has sent in a prayer request to say that God has prevailed that Jesus has delivered and set her son totally free from the power of those drugs and we're just believing that God's going to use his testimony to reach others who are in the same condition perhaps you're bound perhaps you have something that is bigger than you are that has control of your life well I want you to know that there's freedom in Jesus I want you to know that he has the power to set even the captives free and we are just believing that your faith will be inspired today as we teach the Word of God to you that you'll just reach up and believe and call on the Lord and that you will experience the same deliverance and liberty in your own life hundreds and thousands of people millions of people I guess would be a more accurate number have experienced the deliverance and the healing power of Jesus Christ around the world and if you have not experienced it for yourself it's not too late you could invite the Lord into your life and I know that he will make a change the Apostle Paul said old things have passed away behold all things have become new and that is what happens when we surrender our lives to follow the Lord Jesus Christ so don't forget to visit our web page contact us let us know that you're watching the Eagles cry and share with us any prayer requests that you have we believe in the power of prayer and we believe in the power of agreement and we want to agree with you in faith and then watch God take over we want to watch him move and when he gets involved he changes things he can change even the darkest circumstance well we want to get right into the Word of God we've been speaking to you on from the Book of Isaiah and the theme has been from obscurity to visibility let's look to the Word of God together and I say a chapter 58 we've been studying these verses together and I don't want to go back and take my time to go through the whole study I hope that you have been able to follow if not again go to the webpage click on and subscribe to the podcast and you can go back and watch the episodes that you've missed I'm excited about being able to offer that to you absolutely free of charge if you have a computer then you can just follow this series all the way through if you'd like to order it on DVD you can do that as well now it's time to preach or to teach I say a chapter 58 and we've been talking about as a theme verse 10 and 11 let me read them to you quickly and if thou draw out by soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness be as the noonday the last time we were together we moved in to verse 11 and it says and the Lord shall guide thee continually I don't know about you but that's a promise that I need I'm gonna stand on that one for myself right here today that God would guide me continually he said he would satisfy thy soul in drought even when it's dry even when it's barren all around you even when you're living adverse circumstances of darkness and famine spiritually and drought oh he said I will satisfy your soul and make fat your bones swore to promise it speaks of health and and of course spiritual prosperity and we also believe that God is able to bless and provide for our natural needs as well and thou shalt be like a watered garden a garden that has automatic irrigation when water is needed water is provided now doesn't that sound just like the Lord you shall be like a watered garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail not there is no end to the supply of the living water that the Lord Jesus Christ wants to give us in this hour as he moves us from obscurity to visibility now again remember the definition of obscurity is a lack of clearness or clarity it also means a difficulty in being understood and then it also speaks about being little known or perhaps being in the shade and God says your light is going to rise in obscurity and so you may feel very distracted you may feel like you have a difficulty understanding and having clarity in God's Word hearing his voice knowing his will but we're entering into a new season blessed be the name of the Lord and in this season we're believing that God is going to give a special clearness clarity to know the mind of God and the will of God and so we thank the Lord for this great transition I tell a story I'm not sure if I've told it here on the Eagles cry or not but if I have would you bear with me a little bit and let me tell it quickly again some years ago you know I have four children my oldest just turned nine my youngest just turned one years old she's walking all over the house her name is Mariah destiny my oldest is Benji juda and then my second son Joshua River and then our third daughter is our third child which is a daughter Olivia Zion but when I think perhaps Benjamin was a couple years old three years old or so and Joshua was a baby we went to the zoo in Atlanta when I was a little boy we used to visit Zoo Atlanta and even my mother tells me that when she was a little girl she used to visit the zoo in Atlanta Georgia in the United States and there was a special gorilla who lived in the zoo a very young gorilla when my mother was going to see this gorilla as a young girl but as I was old enough to go and see the gorilla was getting older and a few years ago the gorilla died and the gorillas name was Willie B and it was famous there were billboards that said have you been to see Willie B lately and so initially Willie B was kept in a glass cage with some iron bars but as the zoo progressed and prospered they built all such a beautiful habitat for gorillas and their breeding these gorillas it oh it's such a beautiful enclosure and they've got families you know the gorillas are making families and so forth and etc and so anyway Willie B died he was very old and he died and and I think I remember reading in the paper and we get to zoo Atlanta and we're walking around I hadn't been in years but so it all looked new to me and we came across a little area where there was a crowd gathered and we stopped with stop my wife stopped pushing the stroller I think my mother was with us and we wondered what was going on and we realized that we had walked into something like a press conference the media was there and there was a couple people couple gentleman standing and I recognized the mayor of Atlanta and wondered what was going on and all of a sudden I looked and I saw this big clump of something covered up with a black cloth or like a blanket sort of us satiny looking blanket and what we realized was they were unveiling a statue and the artist who had come from somewhere far away had come to be a part of this great unveiling of this great masterpiece and so when the time came the artist pulled off the cover and of course we were just standing there waiting to see what this beautiful sculpture was going to be and it was it was Willie B it was a bronze sculpture of this very famous gorilla but I have to tell you the detail was was extravagant and it was beautiful well anyway it was as beautiful as a gorilla can be and it was exciting III was excited I've never forgotten it several times during the day we bumped into the sculptor and talked to him and he talked to the children and so forth and sometimes in the spirit this experience that I had in the natural will come back to me in the spirit and I've wondered about that why does this come back to me some time I'm in prayer some time I'm worshiping the Lord some time I'm preaching and it comes back to me and I think I've got the answer I think it's a part of this release I hope you don't think I've lost my mind when I say it this way but I think it's a part of this whole release of God bringing us from obscurity to visibility he's working on a masterpiece and the masterpiece is you you're the masterpiece you see I believe according to the scripture that from all of time back wait to the Garden of Eden God has been working on a bride he's building a bride the scripture tells us in Revelation 19 that we should rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come and the wife or his wife the wife of the lamb hath made herself ready I'm not ashamed to tell you that I have a personal revelation that I am a part of the wife of the heavenly bridegroom but Jesus Christ somebody said well doesn't that sound a little well you call it anything you want to I just want to have a relationship a real one not a religious one you know a couple emails have come in from people who were not critical but giving me a little bit of a warning because I have said a few things about the organized church I'm not against the organized church but I'm against anything that's dead I'm against anything that names the name of Jesus but there's no life to it it's all tradition and ritual that's what I am I am I have to be honest I'm against that and you say why because it's robbing oh here I go it's robbing God's people of the life that jesus promised us for today John 10:10 said I have come that you might have life and not that you would sit somewhere in a dead mausoleum and and reminisce about what God was but he said I have come that you might have life and that you might have it how more abundantly hallelujah I believe in the book of Acts I believe that every Church should be an extension of the book of Acts I believe that the Living Church of Jesus Christ must be more than rituals traditions and icons we've got to be a people we've got to be a body the ecclesia in in Greek is is a fellowship a community of believers who go forth in the power and demonstration of Almighty God and so I I certainly take your thoughts into consideration I hope that you have misunderstood me perhaps I've misunderstood you and and we're just trying to iron that out but I'm not going to change my mind because I've read the book I've read the book and the book tells me this book the Bible the Holy Word of God tells me what church is supposed to be like what it's supposed to look like what it's supposed to act like how it's supposed to function it's supposed to function like the church that was born on the day of Pentecost Shavuot and we read about that birth in Acts chapter 2 get your Bible out sometime and read the book of Acts and if you're not experiencing in your life what those men and women experienced then we want to reach up higher I am NOT a cessationist I do not believe that these things are finished and over with and done when the Apostles died I believe that Hebrews 13 and 8 is the theme Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever what he did yesterday he's able to do again today what's he waiting on he's waiting on you and I a great let me get back did I go off on a little trail there but I won't take it back because I feel it inspired I feel feel like you need to know where I'm coming from I'm not against any particular church or any particular brand of religion or denomination or whatever and when I say traditional Church I don't necessarily mean orthodoxy I I just mean any group of people that have settled whoever you are whoever we are if we have settled for form instead of power if we have settled for religious function instead of spirituality if we have settled for a painted fire now if you're lost in a in a snowstorm in a blizzard you need more than a picture of a fire in a magazine to keep you warm you need to be able to do more than then find a picture in the encyclopedia and hold your hands up to it and hope that that's going to be enough to keep you alive you need to find the real fire well I want you to know I have found the real fire is a seven year old boy I was baptized with the Holy Ghost and fire that was 32 years ago and that fire of God is still burn in my heart and I despise religion I'm looking for reality and I believe that's what's happening behind the veil underneath the sheet or the curtain underneath the sculpture The Grates not sculpture where the sculpture the creation he is the sculptor the Creator I believe that underneath this veil the great sculptor is working on shaping us molding us into his likeness and into his image I heard a great man of God in fact a prophet in this prior generation William Branham talked about going to Los Angeles many years ago and visiting the famous cemetery where many many important people including great Hollywood actors of that era were buried and in that same Forest Lawn Cemetery and in that same place the great woman evangelist healing evangelists Aimee Semple McPherson is buried and many years ago William Branham died in 1965 so that's a long time ago but many years ago he said that he visited the grave at the invitation of Roth McPherson Amy's simple Macpherson's son he visited her grave and paid honor and respect to a great woman and they wanted to take him on a little tour of the cemetery and in the cemetery in some of the mausoleums or chapels or whatever you might would find there are duplicates or copies of great sculptures that are housed in beautiful places around the world and one of the sculptures that took brother branham's attention was this great sculpture that Michelangelo did of Moses and Moses is sitting with the tablets in his arms and so forth and and they told brother branham a story that he really liked and he said that when Michelangelo had worked so ferociously hard on making this beautiful sculpture and he wouldn't let wouldn't let anybody see it and he was doing it privately and working many many many many hours of the day and night and he was coming to a place where he was almost finished and one day he was caught in the inspiration of what he had created it it inspired him it looked so real what he had made with his hands and it was almost like he was standing before Moses but it was a sculpture of Moses but it it so took him he was so caught up in the spirit of what he had created with his own hands that he struck the sculpture on the knee leaving a scar on the sculpture he struck it and he said speak he was so inspired and this that had come from his imagination and he had created it with his own hands it became so real it looked so real that he said speak to me speak and you know that's exactly what I believe I believe that behind the veil ho hallelujah I believe that behind the veil the Lord Jesus by the power of the Holy Spirit is working on a bride he's working on a masterpiece he is dealing with our attitudes that are unlike him dealing with the vices and habits of our life that that have control over us instead of us having control over them dealing with the soulish issues of man working on the inside of the inside and and you know what I mean iron sharpening iron and God's knocking off the rough edges of our life and I believe that we're getting ready to step out from obscurity into visibility I believe there's a great generation of people a company of people that are about to step forth in the power in the glory and in the annoy ting of the Lord Jesus Christ finishing his ministry carrying on what he started what he accomplished carrying it on as the disciples came to him and said what must we do that we might work the works of God you know this might work better if I could fold my hands and tie them in my lap or something I probably distract you I'm sorry but I just get a little bit excited sometime when I think about being a part of that and you know it's not pleasant having the blanket over your face but God's doing that because He loves us that he's protecting us and he's working on us in secret but he's getting ready to introduce us he's getting ready to launch us he's getting ready to send us forth into the marketplace into the nation's to accomplish what needs to be accomplished before the end of the end I believe we're living in the end days I believe we're in the end times now and we're making preparation for the end of the end and when I say that I mean the end of what we know is this a world I'm getting ready to go home to live with my heavenly father forever and ever and ever and ever and ever while while ages roll on and when time has surrendered to eternity we're going to still be in the presence of our Creator I want to make it I want to to go home one of these days but not without having accomplished what he has called me the reason the destiny of the purpose for which I was born and you my friend whether you feel great or small whether you feel qualified or disqualified whether you feel sufficient or insufficient God has a purpose and he has a plan in your life and it's time for you hallelujah to get out of obscurity to let the Spirit of the Lord invite you into a place where you can hear more clearly his voice where you can articulate and share what he whispers in your ear great friend the great prophetic man in America his name is Bobby Connor and he says something that I love so much he says that God shouts his truths but whispers his secrets and we want to be able to hear both the shouting the trumpet voice and we want to be able to hear the still small voice that whispers the love secrets to us because He loves us so much and so let me just encourage you to press on hold on with everything that's within you greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world and I know times are tough and things are ugly and the hour looks bleak your body is perhaps suffering maybe you're in pain maybe your family is in a mess maybe your job situation is a wreck but I just tell you I I implore you hold on hold on my friend my brother my sister hold on because the darkest hours just before the dawn a beautiful old anthem of the church hold on my child joy comes in the morning hallelujah and I just feel like telling you that the Lord wants to take your ashes and give you gold and silver I believe God wants to take the darkness of your midnight and cause light to rise in your obscurity I just believe that God wants to turn some things around for you suddenly as you turn your faith loose to believe if we can only believe all things are possible to him that believeth and you know we don't have to know how God's going to do it to believe that he is going to we don't have to understand how the house what trips us up you know and sometimes even the wind but we need to believe that he is he is he is he is the scripture said he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him let's seek him like we've never sought him before he will need us because there's two unveilings going on he wants to unveil us to bring us out and he is unveiling him self before us that we could understand him more father I just thank you for the wonderful presence of the Lord that is in this place may it go out may it somehow transfer may it drop down into the home of every person watching this program may may their faith be stirred up and ignited may they not be satisfied with painted fire but seek to find the real fire of the Holy Spirit of God and be changed and transformed in your wonderful lovely name and I pray for the sick right now because you are our healer and our source b'shem adonai yeshua hamashiach in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen any man thank you for watching the Eagles cry tune in again bye bye for now you
