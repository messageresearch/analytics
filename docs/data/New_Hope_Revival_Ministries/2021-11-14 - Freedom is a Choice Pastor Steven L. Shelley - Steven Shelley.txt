your seat for just a moment we're glad that you're in the house of the lord and we're going to go to prayer today perhaps you have a need you just like to make known by lifting your hand say i have a need and i need the lord to intervene on my behalf there's hands all over this building we're remembering those that are behind that camera that we cannot see we remember them to the lord today i have three prayer requests here i'd like to mention to you my cousin carolyn karen propolis she is very low with cancer but my god is a miracle worker and i'm asking that you would uh pray for her ask the lord to touch her bring her up and out and bring deliverance we want to remember the family of ruth ann miller up in michigan today this is a family friend to the small family sister shoshanna's family and she just delivered a baby two weeks ago and she passed unexpectedly last night they say it's from complications from childbirth we want to remember that family leaving behind several children a husband but my father is able to comfort them in this hour he is able to minister to them we also want to remember brother kerry's brother david uh it's my understanding that he fell lost his memory is that right and and uh and was in the hospital and brother kerry is having to take care of some of the statistic logistics as as he's trying to get out of the hospital and into a place of residence let's ask the lord to minister to that need would you would you all pray this is a bit of a mystery and i don't uh i don't have any details too much to give but uh um we left here benjamin and i left work about 20 minutes till five on friday and uh in in separate vehicles and as i pulled onto our road there were tons of of um i'll get it i'll be all right in a minute rescue vehicles and all kinds of flashing lights and things and they let me pass over the railroad track but as i turned and looked up to the railroad track there was a body laying there it was clear that the person was deceased and uh i prayed i paused the moment there at the railroad track and and prayed for the family and and then went on home and it just got to bothering me so i got in the vehicle i went back i saw it again and as soon as i got on the other side of the railroad track to put my trash out they blocked it and wouldn't let me come back across so i had to go up down the dirt road um the from the second glimpse i thought it was a lady or she had like shoulder length hair but we found out yesterday it was a man who had come there to take his life my heart has just i i just can't seem to shake it and like i told my family yesterday somebody loved him he might not have known it he may not have realized it but somebody loved him and they are hurting and grieving his loss and he left a note with the with the man who runs the dump and that man is so troubled because he told him as he was walking away i'm going up here to take my life and the man begged him pleaded with him please don't go please don't do that plea please and he said he is still pleading with him and called 9-1-1 and he and he saw the man he there was nothing else he could do waiting trying to answer the questions of 9-1-1 i don't really think that should have been spoken out loud but i did anyway i just can't seem to shake it and i think there must be a reason there must be a he left a note to his wife maybe the wife is i know she's devastated it doesn't matter what the circumstances are he could have been terribly abusive to her but i know there must be broken hearts today yes yes and mine is if nobody else says would you please ask the lord to help the the ones who knew him and loved him and that poor man at the dump is so traumatized he told my wife he said i cried again on the way to work today if i i wished i could have done more i wished i would have known more to do but i did all i knew to do please pray for that situation i would love to know that god hears these prayers and that he's somehow helping something turning something you can never undo that but something could be made right in the family or something let's ask the lord to redeem a very tragic situation let's stand again and take these needs to the lord can we sing the course to there's power in prayer power to spare thank you lord jesus there is power in prayer power to spare all that you ever need is waiting right there just

privilege it is to be able to do that i'm going to sing just a little bit of a song i didn't practice with a key but i want to sing just a little bit of this song because it's been in my mind this

and the storm [Music] oh and sometimes in your doubts and confused [Music] you've even questioned where is the lord you know i've prayed in the dark of the midnight when doubt was all i could see oh but while patiently waiting for more that's when i heard my lord whisper to me you know what he said he said in i know you're fighting a battle but you're gonna win oh at last oh fast don't you bow [Music] now we know that the lord is soon coming oh because we see the prophets words true and now with just a few days remaining tell me what is what is a good soldier to do would you sing with me he

the fire and the storm [Music] oh and sometimes in your doubts and confusion you've even questioned oh where is the lord but you know i have prayed in the dark of the midnight when doubt was all i could see but while patiently waiting for more that's when i heard my lord whisper to me you sing with me tell me what he says he says endure you must endure till the end [Music] oh we're all fighting a battle but we're gonna win at last oh fast don't bow down [Music] if you believe you can with his help give him some praise [Music] we can [Applause] would you thank the lord for these musicians and their gifts and talents and all their giving for the lord those who are running the stream and let's all stand together we're going to read this morning from second corinthians chapter 10. we're going to read beginning in verse 4. these are familiar portions of scripture we have been speaking now for two times together sunday and tuesday night the battle is raging and it is it is raging it's raging on every hand but we are so thankful that we know the victor the one who went all the way and paid the price and won the victory for us and uh this morning i want to take it to just another place same theme but i want to take it to another place and call it freedom is a choice for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of what strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity thank you for helping me every thought to the obedience of christ you may think it's nearly impossible but it's not we must this is the only way to overcome in satan's eden is to be able to take every thought when you recognize that you're having a thought that is contrary to what god's word has said about you you must immediately refuse it you must immediately rebuke it and tell it what it is it's a lie you're a liar devil and the father of all eyes i'm going to take god at his word bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ and having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled i think if we concentrate on our own obedience we won't have much time to get around to worrying about somebody else's disobedience now let's pray together just a moment father we thank you for your word it's rich it's life to us it's hope and strength it gives us courage and encouragement it corrects us it gives us leadership and direction it helps us lord to recognize the day we're living in and the grace that has been set aside for the last of the last days now lord we look to you for help we know that you've been so gracious to us in this service already your presence has been here as we lifted up your name and worshiped in spirit and truth and now we know the real battle begins we know lord that now as your word goes forth that we have been told that every demon in hell is against that word not only against it in written form but against it when it is preached because we understand that faith comes by hearing the word of god we recognize that our enemy will not just lay over roll over and play dead he will do everything and everything he can to distract our minds from the purity of your word but today lord we look to you and we ask that you will give us strength and grace to hear what you have set aside for us give us courage to respond accordingly not only with our amen but most importantly with our life lord today i can only speak as an individual but i want a decree that i choose freedom i choose deliverance i choose liberty this is what your blood has accomplished on my behalf and i make it my choice today even as i did yesterday and if you should grant me tomorrow i'll do the same now lord give us all the same strength the same faith the same courage to choose what you have paid such a high price to secure for us and we'll give you the glory and the honor and the praise for it's in the lovely name of our lord jesus christ we pray and the saint said you may be seated now do your best to stay with me if you can because some of you need to make sure that you are making a daily choice for freedom because the enemy is desiring to bind you with something he wants to bind us he wants to impede us from moving forward to be a victorious people now jesus didn't die to leave us in our condition did he he died and rose again to deliver us from where we were and to place us where we should be according to the mind of god and really the battle is won in jesus now we're fighting the battle's raging and we're fighting but what we're really doing is just showing up to claim the victory that he's already won for us and in showing up we're being obedient to what the word said and it's not easy to show up sometime hello it's not easy to show up sometime why you just ask anybody every monday it's rare if if everybody jumps up and first sound of the alarm and says whoa i get to go to work today how many of you do that praise the lord jennifer uh can you imagine a school teacher and yet she really loves the privilege that god has given her to work that job now there may come a day somewhere by thursday hump day that she may not be quite as excited but she has to make a choice to show up and to show up at her best well i want you to know the children of god are making the same choice every day to show up in this warfare my granny used to say there is no discharge in this war there's no retirement in this fight we have to fight all the way to the end as we sung just a moment ago he that endureth how long till the end the same shall be saved so we are going to fight and we are going to have stress and we're going to have pressure and we're going to have oppressing things happen to us brother branham told us about that great battle the greatest battle ever fought and he told us that it would be a battle of the mind fought on the battleground or the battlefield of the mind you know it's really the only place satan can fight the believer and i don't know what it'll be like in the future but we have been a blessed people as christians in america we've had so many freedoms given to us haven't we we haven't had to fear for our life we haven't had the fear for for a lot of persecution from the government and so forth like like some of our friends in other nations who have literally shivered in the dark sneaking out to go to the house of god afraid to be discovered because it could cost them their life some of us even know families that have lost loved ones because of their dedication to christ in nations where there was a cool where there was a group of people raising up to try to take the nation and uh we know preachers i actually knew a pastor that was murdered for his faith his son pastors a church in this message today as a testimony that god doesn't make mistakes one one passes and leaves the torch and another raises up to take that torch but we in america have been greatly blessed we just go to church when we feel like it when we want to we decide we don't want to sometimes we just stay out we do things just kind of like we want to we can choose a job we don't have to be forced for the rest of our life in a miserable job we have all kinds of freedoms available to us and we're blessed we don't know what the future is going to look like we don't know how it's going to be tomorrow but we better take advantage of what god has given us today and we ought to be thankful for it now these freedoms that we have let's just say in america they weren't free somebody had to pay a great price i'm not talking about politicians i don't know how the price the politicians are paying but i want you to know those who have defended our freedoms on foreign soil and even on our own soil those who have given their lives the ultimate sacrifice to guarantee that you and i would have freedom that lady liberty that stands out there in the harbor is a beacon to a lot of immigrant families who have come legally to our nation and have been granted freedom and many of you and and i myself have ancestors who were so thankful to be able to escape what was going on in their home country and come and live in america and have freedom but it wasn't free and i want you to know as a believer the freedom that you and i have wasn't free and it wasn't cheap it cost him his life it was an ultimate sacrifice and he didn't just overcome in the hour that he was living but he overcame for all eternity and the victory that he won at calvary is not just mine the night i get saved but it's mine today it'll be mine tomorrow and it'll be mine for all eternity and we're learning to live a grateful life we're learning that thanksgiving isn't a day of the year it's a lifestyle and we're learning that there's victory in giving god the praise and there's victory in being thankful for what the lord has provided for us i want to give you a few quotations this morning that i've already given you this week and then we're going to move on to something in the message testimony which is a testimony about the raising of a little dead boy this was given in west palm beach florida and it's paragraph 14 and this is the quote that talks about fighting for every inch this is from last week's notes you've got to go do it and you've got to fight for every inch of ground that you have let me ask you spiritually have you found that to be the truth have you really found out that there are no miles we're not winning miles in this hour we're winning inch by inch by inch by inch temptations come and how do we overcome them inch by inch by inch and not by our own strength or our own wit or our own intelligence we're overcoming as sister april said by the blood of the lamb by the price that jesus paid for us but we have to show up and we have to maintain i saw i saw some maintainers here this morning i saw some pushing the fireball are you with me i saw some of you nobody called you to come forward nobody orchestrated that but i saw and i want you to know i wish you could have seen i may get choked up here i wish you could have seen the look on some of your faces when you come i knew when you come down the allument business i knew you weren't coming down here to be seen i knew you weren't coming down here to show off a new frock or a new tie i knew by the look on many of your faces that you were coming because you wanted to show up because you wanted to push you wanted to maintain the victory that we've been winning in the last few weeks and you wanted to push the fireball a little farther down the hill believing that as it goes forward with momentum it will increase and increase and increase you will begin to speak your own deliverances as you shift the atmosphere around you and yes there's a battle there's a battle going on yours may not look like mine and mine may not look like yours but it doesn't matter what it looks like anyhow jesus has the last say it may be job trouble it may be physical malady it may be financial issue it may be spiritual problem it may be that you have some sort of issue or you may have some sort of insecurity or you may be carrying something that you've carried far too long i don't know what the battle looks like for you but i'm telling you the same victory that i win is the victory that you can win and we win it every day and we take it inch by inch by inch maybe some habit has creeped into your life you can't seem to get the victory over it once and for all it's what you'd like to have but you can't find that once and for all victory let me tell you what you can find inch oh yes just one day at a time just one day at a time just one minute by minute inch by inch he goes on to say every man in here that's born of the spirit of god knows that you've had to fight for every inch of ground just a moment toe the mark with satan isn't that right he said friends this is not a picnic i hear some christians talking i wonder why i didn't get an invitation to the picnic because there is no picnic this is not a trip to the carousel this is a bloody battle oh yes it is and it takes obedience and there can be no obedience in our life without determination and there can be no determination without faith you've got to first believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those who diligently seek him and once you realize that and recognize that this is not just a general promise that can be very flippantly claimed but it must be claimed as an individual and once you realize that because you have heartache and trouble doesn't mean that god doesn't love you or that he has forsaken you or that he has forgotten you i dare say everyone in this room has felt that way a time or two and if you haven't i don't know where you're from i can't imagine what kind of christian life you've been living if there wasn't some point where you felt like the voice was silent you've ever seen joan of arc or heard joan of arc's testimony here god is speaking to her she's moving forward to take the victory and lead a nation to victory and all of a sudden she needs to hear from these voices presumably god's speaking to her in various and sun dry ways and now they're silent and now she's arrested and now she's in prison and now her life she's being ravished and beaten you check history and now she's about to pay the ultimate price because she surrendered her life to god she's forsaken by her own church the roman catholic church and she's about to be burned at the stake by the same ones that once rejoiced as she was a trophy and a member of their church and they once rejoiced because she was a vital part of their church community and now she's going to go to the state and be treated like a witch and all she needs is a voice all she needs is a little comfort all she needs is a reminder i'm still with you child and she can't hear anything and she comes right down to the end and it seems like god is silent i want you to know sometimes he is he may be silent but you are never alone you are never forsaken he may not be doing all the talking right now but he is with you he said i'll be with you even until the end i will never leave you i will never forsake you says the lord but there's an old enemy out there there's an adversary out there i want you to know demons are real i don't know who everybody is this morning i don't know what your thoughts are i don't know who's streaming this service i know we get all kinds of people who stream a service i know there are many people that don't believe in demons i read this week where brother branham said if angels are real and i know they are the demons are real he said in fact the demon is just as real as an angel ever dared to be same reality and i want you to know those demons were once out there just turned on the godless those who had not repented those unbelievers scrambling around the mate believer but they weren't too concerned about the believer but we're living in the last of the last days now and the message has told us that there's thousands times ten thousands of now imps demon spirits you know what's so mysterious to me and it's just hard to get my mind around that some of these evil spirits are the very same beings that once worshipped god in spirit once stood before the throne the prophet talked about before they were spun off i can show that to you at another time until before they were spun off in that great adversarial war that took place when lucifer who was created to worship god and to have authority over the newly created earth he now says i'm no longer satisfied with my earthly existence and my assignment on planet earth i want to ascend and put my throne above the throne of god and when he did his rebellion persuaded two-thirds of the angels to now follow him and when he was cast out they were cast out with him is that right brother branham said that was them being spun off out there without a body and now they're they're evil spirits or demons there are several other explanations for what's where some of those spirits came from we can look at that another time but they're real they know who you are they're out to talk to you oh brother shelly you're just getting creepy this morning no i'm here to tell you you need to understand you've got an adversary and you need to be i need to be on my toes i don't need to run out to fight him without knowing who he is and what he has power to do i was studying this week i i spent quite a bit of time yesterday afternoon putting together 45 pages of quotations on this subject that we may never get to but it sure was a blessing to study to put all those things together i relearned some things that i had forgotten about how those spirits operate and how they would operate in the last days they don't like to operate singularly they like to operate in families or groups and i want you to know they have an unusual sense of being able to discern when their days are numbered in that odd when they're about to lose the hold that they have maintained for so long on some poor person some precious soul that's been held in bondage by families of groups of demon spirits and things begin to change in that life brother branham said they come into a service like the one we're in here tonight and he said they begin to realize their days are numbered they're about to be cast out and so he said let me tell you what they do and i want you to hear me he said let me tell you what they do they start calling out this is too much for some folks they start calling out to one another gathering together support come on now you may have never seen this in the spirit but you've seen it in the natural i know you have you'll see how those spirits work they work on sympathies their whole theme is unsanctified mercy they'll try to get you to feel sorry for something sorry for somebody not realizing all along that this is not people problem this is demonic you can't win a people problem or solve a people problem you can't do that if it's a if it's a spiritual thing you're not going to be able to solve it with counseling you're only going to be able to solve it with power and with authority and i don't care how they stack are you with me i think you are now i don't care how they stack up i don't care how they gather i don't care how they call out listen whoo i didn't mean to say all this this morning this is off subject a little bit i wanted to lay this out for you a little more orderly how many of you have ever been listening to prayer lines oh and brother branham is beginning to pray he said wait a minute i lost that this is a man move with great discernment and not only did he operate in the in the in the spiritual gift of discerning of spirits but he was operating in something a little higher than that and he was able by a prophetic gift to see the mind of god and to hear the mind and will of god in a particular situation but he had to receive it from the lord it wasn't something he carried all the time he didn't just always know he wasn't all-knowing that's god not a prophet a prophet's not all-knowing god is all-knowing and so he received this information just like jesus did somebody said wait a minute just like jesus did that what jesus said he said i can't do anything unless it's given to me and my father whoo he see couldn't even say get up take up thy bed and walk if the father wasn't putting that in him and showing him hey there's a situation my my mind just a minute glory i know it's just hooping and hollering to some but i sure do like it oh i don't get to hoop and holler too much i'm not a great sports fan you know i almost defend my children my sons because i'm not as fan fan favorites as they are and i don't know who who these people are they talk about them like they live in our in our shed out there you know how did you know he won something he he did so oh wonderful and i just love it i even caught one of her girls saying our team and i said you know it's not our team we don't own the team they don't give us profits they're just a team oh that's dangerous to talk like that in the south in the wintertime but people get all carried away in that and i have to be honest when it's my boys playing softball i can get pretty caught up in the spirit of that too as some of you know i try to maintain myself the best i can because so many of the blues know i'm a pastor so i have to be a little bit you know i don't get carried away in that like a lot of people do but i want you to know there are some things that excite me and there's a place in this word there's a place that i can get in this message that really excites me because there are some simple keys that can solve some very complex problems in life we like to complicate things and so we often step over simple solutions but i want you to know this message of the hour this word of god that has been given to us is filled with simple solutions to life's complicated situations we just have to be willing to to sometimes look at it in a very simple way instead of a very intellectual way so brother branham is praying for people under that under that gift and also standing in the office that he was called to you can hear it for yourself there's people in this room that saw it with their own eyes there's people streaming this service still alive that were in those meetings and their needs were discerned and their problems were called out and they received healing sister wes sitting back there received a miraculous healing as she went through the prayer line brother branham discerned her need told her what it was said your back trouble has left you she said i felt like i was walking on air just walking on the clouds and god did exactly what he said sometimes brother branham would be praying for someone he'd see a vision he was a seer also and seer prophets see and so he was seeing the need seeing different things going on sometimes what was very close to him one minute would move away from him and that would be for various reasons sometimes doubt would come into that person's heart you think that you say i just don't see how that's possible how could anybody be standing in that divine presence of god and doubt because they're human beings and because they get distracted like we get distracted and so sometimes what was very loud to brother branham very plain to him in one moment it would draw away and he would say oh it's leaving sometimes he'd say to the person you're moving away from me sometimes he would say and a much younger person is coming close so every time the movement was happening wasn't because of doubt sometimes it was god just moving things in the realm of the spirit because there was a victory that was about to be executed in the life of that person are you still with me now don't you think for one minute i'm hung up in the past because jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever and if he ever did it then he can do it again today he's still god he's still a healer he's still a deliverer now brother branham looked at disease a whole lot different than doctors look at disease now very forward thinking doctors who study the quantum physics they look at disease a lot more like brother branham looked at disease 50 60 70 years ago brother branham would say things like there's a vibration remember he had a gift in his hand for a certain part of his ministry that would cause a registering of the vibration of that particular disease in his hand and as brother bosworth would tell he was able to look then at that hand and know what the disease was by the physical effect the vibration would have on his hands somebody said that just sounds like new age witchcraft to me well you might see it that way not understanding that disease is not just being uh afflicted but there's a life to it and it's many times spiritually driven and brother branham recognized that he recognized that in many cases illness and disease were demonic even in the bodies of christian people believers he recognized that and when we have time to lay this out for you 45 pages when we have time to lay this out for you i can show you the sequence of this revelation and how it began to come to him at different stages in his ministry and sometimes he would be up there praying for someone and he said oh i lost that he said i oh he said i see what it is i would have liked to have been sitting there he said oh i see what it is he said there's a man sitting right back over there who has the same problem incredible you're standing before me with a disease there's a man sitting right back over there who has the same disease and the demon not all disease is demonic some of it is self-inflicted but sometimes it's demonic has a life and a spirit to it a life to it there's no nobody hardly on the planet that would tell us the cancer doesn't have a life to it it's actually a living cell and a multiplication of living cells they're not healthy whole cells they're deformed as cells and they continue to multiply their deformity but they're alive therefore a tumor that's filled with cancerous cells has a life to it and brother branham would not always be able to detect the sickness unless it was one that carried a life and this is what he said that's so interesting to me he said now this started first as a spirit stay with me this started first as a spirit before it became a disease now he said we can treat the disease that's what we all do we we find us we know what's going on because we self-diagnose oh it's getting quiet again dr google we all go see dr google and we say dr google these are my symptoms this is what i'm going through is this normal and we put in her and oh my does the truth ever come full unfolding out on the screen and i'm telling you what you'll have people walking around saying i have colon cancer i have come on i have early onset dementia no you just forgot a name because you cram your brain full of your phone all day long and then when you need to remember something you're cramming out your brain cells but the enemy and dr google will cause people to move in fear when they don't have to move in fear amen because some of these things that manifest in the physical are really spiritual problems and they are there because of the presence of a demon spirit and so brother branham learned if i can just discern what this is and go to the root of that and cast it out in the name of jesus this particular sort of scenario i'm talking about now he would say oh i lost that it it moved oh he said yes there's a man back here he has the same disease he got the same problem that you did and he said that spirit that same demon this demon here knows that his day his moments are numbered he's about to lose his hole i'm about to cast him out are you with me i can't believe i'd preach like this with visitors here he said this demon spirit here would start calling out to that demon spirit that that man had because of the disease it was present in his life calling out for help wouldn't you have loved to have been prophetic enough to hear that a demon spirit occupying this man's body knowing he's fixing to go you see a demon is never satisfied unless he has a body to dwell in because he was separated from his original created body as an angel and now he wants to function by occupying something and remember these demon spirits uh they they dwell in three three different realms the physical realm the spiritual realm and the religious realm and brother branham is the only one i've ever heard that put the third realm in there and called it the realm of religion and he names that there are certain demon spirits that function in each of those realms and if you can go to the root of that problem and get that spirit on the run the disease has to go isn't that amazing somebody said why are you telling us this because we're too sick i want to believe that if this is the truth and i believe it is that you and i might be able to learn how to discern the root of our problem and know that the blood of jesus christ can be sent to the root of the problem just like an axe to the root of the tree you see some demons operate in the physical realm and then some demons operate in the spiritual realm and what nathan was doing up here last uh oh it's getting late what what nathan was doing up here uh last sunday thank you all help me help me that's right get me through this uh at three colon 44 that's three hours and 44 minutes in you turn there you go on the app you fast forward to three of hours and 44 minutes and you will find that there was a battle going on up here on this platform if there had been minded people here maybe visitors here they might able to run out the door they might would have said them people has lost their minds you know what you go tell that because you couldn't tell anything more close to the truth in that we have lost our minds because we read the new testament and he said we have the mind of christ the mind of christ is above and beyond the human mind it's above human understanding i'm telling you jesus has an answer and a solution and a remedy to every problem that we have including sickness and disease i don't know what all god is accomplishing for our brother stephen curry but i will tell you this he has is making so much improvement i get pictures every other day and i'm thankful for them and i want you to know i could show you two days ago picture and the first picture that we got and you would hardly believe that it was the same person because things are happening in his body going into a third week now days have become weeks and strength is coming somebody said what's going on let me tell you what's going on god is showing himself to be who he said he was [Applause] that's all that's all it is don't make it anything more than what it is god is saying i am the same yesterday today and forever god is saying you don't have to understand just trust me he says just trust me hallelujah hallelujah and so now hospice says you no longer need us every day imagine how this family feels some of them sitting here this morning to have the hospice nurse look and say i've got i got good news bad news the good news is you don't need me every day the bad news is i can only come every third day but that's really not bad news except the family really likes him and they want to see him and they're all sad that he might not be there i've had so many people say is this is this uh uh where are we about to see a creative miracle is god getting him ready because he is gonna i'm i just want you to focus on what god is saying to us now i'm showing myself i'll tell you what god's doing he's saying he's saying a man doesn't have to be sick to die he's saying my servants don't have to waste away to nothing i can touch their bodies i can baffle the minds of those who study these kinds of things come on now and you know why there's such victory happening and why there's so many changes happening is because there's a different approach now and those who are praying in the family that's ministering to him and those that are praying the most for him are doing it from a different perspective altogether realizing we're not just operating against a disease but we're operating against something that has spirit life and it has to be dealt with in a spiritual manner come on now you see so what brother nathan was doing i got to get back to my notes what nathan was doing up here with that sword it doesn't do a lot for demons that are operating in the physical realm because those that sword you know it could have clipped his daddy's ear but in the physical it was not accomplishing a whole lot but every battle's not in the physical did you read the scripture for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty threw god to the pulling down a stronghold but when he under the anointing began to wave that sword back and forth no there was no waving to it he was a swinging ant and like i said that will absolutely shake up your church entity and that will even upset some people around the message because they'll say there's no church order for that but they forget to understand that there are demons that operate in the spiritual realm and they can only be fought in the spiritual and so although he was carrying out a physical act he wasn't trying to change anything in the physical it was it was an act of faith and obedience against those demon spirits that operate in the spiritual realm and in the religious realm oh yes those oppressing spirits of depression and darkness and nervousness and anxiety and come on now you i know god dealt with some things as that sword began to fly and i've just made up my mind no matter what they say about us you don't have to live this life you don't have to walk in our shoe leather you don't have to fight the same battle we fight we're all fighting a battle but it may not look the same so you you do it you do you you do you and will do us amen because we understand we're understanding that there's a spiritual battle that can only be one with spiritual weapons all right are you still with me he said friends this is not a picnic it's a battleground we never come here to eat cookies and so forth we are in a battle that's the rest of the quote testimony now in a message uh i got to hurry deceive church by the word let me world by the world let me make sure there was nothing else i want to say about those oh yeah yeah i do i want to go back to that one more time real quick he said now yes oh oh the same spirit this spirit up here knows that he stays he just has a short time to work here he's about to be dealt with so he's calling out to another demon spirit for for help brother brown said for help calling out one to another for help and uh i love the next thing he says not every time but i love the next thing he says he just ran back and he said but that's all right because god is going to set you both free i like that i like that that bless is my blesser [Applause] here you are you defeated demon of disease you're calling out to try to get reinforcement but i'm here to tell you in the name of the lord god is about to deal with you both you're both going out both of you are going to know the healing that you've that you're standing in need uh look right back he says that right sir do you have such-and-such sir that's why you're here amen and let it be so amen and it was so it was so we forget some of these things we forget some of these things and we forget how spirits call out to one another and how they like to operate in groups and families and how they're all the time looking for sympathy demons are are really sympathy seekers but they're not really looking for i feel so sorry for you they're really looking for somebody that'll come over another spirit that'll come and strengthen them and hide them i'm not going into it this morning but one of the things we were dealing with in the spiritual this week mentioned it a little bit here tuesday night was what god later revealed to me was operating sort of like a trojan horse and you know what that is just like the enemy he will fool us into accepting let's just say this like this the the delivery because when we just had a young man here that had gotten a diagnosis from the doctor and we were all working on him trying to make sure that he didn't accept that diagnosis and that he didn't he was visiting with us and we didn't want him to say mine you say well that don't matter yeah i think it matters i don't think your problem should be your identity your identity should be found in jesus christ come on now you may suffer with migraines but they don't belong to you and so one of my daughters just spoke up and said what about that box of rattlesnakes remember what brother branham said about that box of rattlesnakes you can't take delivery you open the door of your home and take that delivery those become your rattlesnakes and the enemy comes like that you can't claim that now you can certainly do something about it i'm not saying that you shouldn't what i am saying is you can't claim that now as your new identity you've got brother branham told us he said you've got to refuse delivery he said well then the enemy will say well yes sir this does belong to you this package does belong to you said see right here your name is on the label and then you've got to raise up and say i don't care if my name is on the label my god said he would supply all of my needs according to his riches in glory my god said none of these diseases my god said that there is as much healing in the atonement as there is salvation so i'm going to claim that and i'm just saying right now uh return to sender you've got the right address you've got the right name but this is not the right delivery so i am sending this delivery right back to the address from which it's come and i refuse it in the name of the lord jesus christ i'm going to take god at his word so it doesn't matter how many demons march against you how many clump up against you to try to bring you under their influence afflict your body torment your mind cause you to be religious instead of sincere whatever the situation is i don't care how many march against you they do not have the power over you or the victory in your life unless you forfeit what's yours you drop the ball and they'll run it all the way home come on they'll get it all the way across the other end of the field if you drop the ball you cannot fumble the promises of god in your life you've got to hold on to them anybody listening you've got to hold on to them with everything you've got now here here is something i want to share as we move on a deceived church by the world remember we are not on a picnic this is a paragraph eight i believe hope i got it right we are not on a picnic but we're in a battlefield he just said that and here's another time saying it he said many people just think that when they become a christian that that's all they need to do the church has done a pretty poor job in helping us to understand it's a little more to it than just joining the church and shaking the preacher's hand you know the devil's not going to turn you loose because you've decided to spend your sundays somewhere else he's going to follow you all the way here he's going to sit down on the pew beside you he's going to call out to somebody else's demon that's right so you you just start thank you finish the battle the battle is just beginning he said just think many people just think that when they become a christian that's all they need to do that settles it forever as they are a christian and everything's going to come easy don't ever get that in your head that sounded vice isn't it let's read on for i become a christian to fight you you didn't become a christian to retire or for somebody else to do the fighting you became a christian he said aye this is his testimony i become a christian to fight fight the good fight of faith he said i'll become a christian to get in the battle lines now i found out what happens to us as we get a little bit uh complacent we start running away from the wars we start running away from the conflict and we know if we say certain things or do certain things we're going to stir up certain spirits and so we just try to dodge them well the sad thing is the more we dodge what's trying to take a hold of our life the stronger and more reinforcements are called in and the and the more helpless we become to overcome it in our own power we have to start reaching out for reinforcements of our own getting other believers to come with their faith and stand on the promise with us and listen folks there's no shame in that there's no shame in asking for help there's no shame in calling out for prayer but how many of you know there are some battles we got to win on our own with jesus we just got to do it with him we can't call a prayer partner every time we have a problem we have to learn the authority and the power that's been given to us in the name of jesus and we have to do something about it i don't want to hold you here too long if you have to slip out god bless you we understand completely but we're we're not ready to be done just yet don't ever get that in your head for i become a christian to fight the good fight of faith i become a christian to get in the battle lines we are christian soldiers and we got to be trained and brought up and know all the techniques of the enemy to know how to fortify to know how to fight the fight so that's for anybody here that would come along and say well we know we don't want there to be an emphasis on the demonic i don't want there to be an emphasis on the demonic either unless the holy spirit is emphasizing if the holy spirit is emphasizing there will be an emphasis and if the holy spirit is emphasizing for a while understanding how to deal with these things it's because we're being brought up and trained in the techniques of the enemy not so that we can get our eyes off of jesus but so we can appropriate every bit of the victory that he won for us at calvary it's got to be appropriated it's ours it's ours but you got to take it up and you've got to claim it as your own is that the truth it's the word it ought to be the truth he said we cannot take excuse me and we can only do that as the holy spirit will reveal it to us we cannot take what some other nation tells us when we go to war some of their ideas but we got to take our own ideas the way the holy spirit would direct us and what ideas he would give us because he is the commanding chief of the army of the christians is that all right with you come holy spirit and teach us how to win the daily victory over every demonic power you see the battle's on in the pool of bethesda he said but the battle is on right against wrong skepticism against the word of god faith against unbelief oh father may the angels of god wave their white flag the banners of the cross and may the holy spirit rise tonight may signs and wonders be done we give you all things believing them we believe we believe we believe in the christianity versus idolatry paragraph 79 that's right i'll be back with you in a minute i'm going to read for a while he said that's right you've got to know the word stay on the word see the great battle is at hand now we've played church for years and years but the hour has come now that when jabras and janice will withstand moses as the bible said they would and it's going to be a spiritual battle conflict there will be some just continue on the denominational church will just move right on into denomination and go on the way it goes but i mean the real true believer is coming to the battlefield that battlefield and you better be versed and know what you're doing or you could take an evil spirit so easy and not know if it's contrary to this word don't believe it stay with the word now wait a minute somebody said how can a believer take an evil spirit because some evil spirits operate in the physical and some operate in the spiritual if they operate in the physical they can cross the barrier and you have got to raise up then and and instead of spending all your time trying to figure out how it got in like the charismatics want us to do we need to first deal with the spirit that's present deal with the life that's there get that thing out amen then we've got to seal the house then we got to get it filled with the holy ghost and fire and some were testifying recently of a refilling of the holy ghost about a week ago or two weeks ago i want to ask you what's wrong with you today don't you need another refilling today that's what i saw that's what i saw i saw some walking down this way this morning to praise without being encouraged to do so and what they were doing is pulling themselves right up and saying lord thank you for the feast oh you blessed me so good but i need another one you fill me up so good but i need to be filled again it's freedom is a choice what were they doing they were saying i'm choosing freedom today i'm choosing to get under that atmosphere and see what god will do because only god knows what monday holds how many do i have to be plain to tell you that your life can spin around in five minutes and you wouldn't recognize it how many have ever been in that kind of we we've experienced it one phone call can change your life one hardship i remember the night my mother's life was changed forever i was going through a terrible divorce i was just a small boy five years old there are so many things that i didn't know then that i now know because i possess and hold the papers i've read things about my own life that i didn't know and the conflict that i didn't know anything about and just as that battle was raging we had just got home from panama city florida friends of ours owned a motel there i found the motel online it's no longer of course in the same hands that it used to be in but part of that motel remains today i'm going to go see it one day i won't stay there but i'm going to go see it one day because i have wonderful memories in that little motel of the family that owned it we had had a wonderful week my grandparents had taken my mother and i to the beach for a little getaway because of what all she was going through and we got home and got in our vehicle and drove to our home on emerson avenue in columbus out by a fort high school junior high school whatever it is out over in columbus that part of columbus and i dozed off to sleep and the phone rang and my mother screamed i could hear almost in my mind you've had those kind of things that get pressed in your memory i can almost hear her scream now and my grandfather that we had just spent a wonderful week of vacationing at the beach and he had treated us so wonderful and had had such a good time himself had had died on the way to the hospital with a massive heart attack and i got up out of the bed as a five-year-old boy and went and helped pull my mother off the floor her life my life but her life was forever changed with one phone call without any warning we didn't even know that we had not even pulled out of the driveway before chest pain started and he began to take the nitro and do the things that he would normally do and as it got a little worse the ambulance was called and he was still alive when they put him in the ambulance but but dead on arrival at martin army hospital i didn't have to bring that up to give you an example but you have your own memories and your own examples how things can be rocking on okay maybe not good but okay and then all of a sudden one thing can shift like that you don't ever know when you're gonna need the victory that you asked for this morning you don't ever know when you're gonna need to make a withdrawal on the grace account that you've been building up this morning i'm telling you when you come into the presence of god and begin to worship him and call on his name and lift him up you may not understand that you're building up reserves you're putting yourself in an atmosphere and whether you know it or not the cells of your body are becoming charged with the glory presence of god you may not know what's happening in your liver you may not know what's happening in your kidney you may not know what's happening in the physical realm you may not be fully aware of what's happening in the spiritual realm but god doesn't bless you just to bless you he blesses you because he is equipping you and preparing you and strengthening you and keeping his word in your life and so any sweat any sacrifice any effort that you put forth as you have these last few weeks to come into his presence in worship it's so worth it you may not know now how worth it how valuable how costly it is sister tebow at home this morning after having this procedure biopsy and kind of serious waiting on some results just making sure her strength is there and whatever to be back in church i glanced down a few moments ago before i came to the pulpit and she was commenting on the service as she was streaming it from her house talk about what an atmosphere what a blessing the service was to her so you don't know that by creating some time and atmosphere in here we're sending that same kind of presence out into the airwaves to encourage to strengthen i thought about brother dwayne this week and what they're going through personally and his obedience in the meeting here a couple weeks ago so i i knew that he sometimes will catch the service go back and catch the service but i didn't know if he would when he saw how long it was and so i sent him a place i wanted him to go i sent him a number and i wanted him to go there i wanted him to see how spiritual things can be fought i wanted him to understand that we were still enjoying the fruit of his obedience here and the ministry that he brought with him and i've been kind of feasting on that atmosphere from last sunday all week and i've been sharing it with different ones who had not yet had an opportunity to be under that anointing because i know that the anointing of god can take care of every problem every situation are you still with me so how can a believer pick up a spirit like that if he's if he's holy ghost filled if he's because these spirits don't all operate in the same realm some physical some spiritual and and in the in the teaching on demonology brother brandon comes along and he says and the worst of all the worst of all in the religious realm in the religious sphere and it talks about how the pharisees were strengthened in their religion not even knowing they were under the inspiration of demon spirits until jesus had to turn and tell him you're of your father the devil the most religious men in the whole in the whole community the leaders of the law and here jesus had to tell them your identity is not from from above your identity is of the serpent you're of a different seed you may be religious you may wear the uniform but you are carrying the wrong seed you're carrying a wrong spirit and it took the son of god to be able to reveal that and expose that and brother branham said so that realm the religious realm is even more awful than when a spirit breaks through in the physical realm or when it breaks through in the spiritual realm i saw some things this week as i was praying and praying for our brother steve and praying for different needs and different situations and so that's what kind of provoked me to start doing these studies and and brother branham which would call out he said these germ diseases these diseases that come on by germs and are contagious in nature like tuberculosis he said well i i guarantee you that has a life and he said i guarantee you that's a demon and that's demonic and when he's making the list of things he mentions cancer and tumor and he mentions and the reason why i believe he differentiated between cancer and tumor is because even a benign tumor has life in it it has cells in it living cells in it and so he said cancer and he said tumor he said epilepsy because he was talking about diseases that were more prevalent in his day and he said tuberculosis and he said in fact germ diseases he put him in a bigger category diseases that are caused by germs all disease doesn't come that way but some do and that germ could be both viral and bacterial every bit of it having a spirit behind it and has to be dealt with and so there were many people receiving prayer in their local church for a healing when more than a healing was needed there needed to be a deliverance somebody needed to take authority over the life be the oppressing demon spirit that had broken through to the physical and had been able to afflict the body of a child of god brother branham's going along and he even mentions cataract things that i would never think of having any life or connection like that but in the same manner of growth and he said it had to be dealt with accordingly now that might make some people a little aggravated or a little mad or upset if they've dealt with some of these things but hey he's giving us an idea of how to deal with the enemy of how to cut him off because your victory over the enemy is your choice it's there it's available to you but you have to make the choice are you still with me all right here i want to close in a minute or two thank you but i've got a long one here so you ready this is so good go tell a message go tell paragraph 80. oh my goodness there's one phrase in here that blesses my blesser he said as we continue a moment with the slaves and our thought there was a proclamation emancipation of the proclamation that was signed and the slaves was going to be free upon a certain day he said you don't know oh if you've never met christ you never know what that mean meant to them slaves he is drawing a parallel between slavery in the natural and slavery in the spiritual didn't we sing this morning i'm no longer a slave to fear there is a parallel the slave had a task master driving his work forcing him to the grind wheel whipping him unmercifully at times to force him to do something that this man felt like he had bought him to do how horrendous how horrible to think about a person being treated like a possession instead of a human being we cannot change history but we must not become victim to that ever again we must call it what it is be bold about it amen it's nearly impossible for a generation this far removed to do everything that would be expected to make it right so we have to somehow depend on the mercy and grace of god and understand that even the horrible things that have happened to the jewish people and horrible atrocities that have happened to mankind through the years have happened for a reason they're horrible they're awful unmentionable but god is ultimately good and he has only allowed things for his purposes i'm really just giving you what the scripture says it's hard sometimes as human beings to filter that through our understanding but it is what the word said so let me read on he said you you you don't know oh if you're never met christ what it meant to them slaves when it went the message throughout the land that you're going to be free on such and such a day at daylight you're going to be free you'll not have to wear you'll oh this is part of what i like you'll not have to wear slave belts anymore neither will you get any more whippings whoa let's read on but you are free you're a citizen of this great united states you are not no more a slave after daylight on a certain certain morning oh with great anticipations they waited if the sinner could only see that if the sinner would only hear the true gospel not the joining of his church but the preaching of the gospel that you can be free from sin that you can be free from your sickness at a certain certain time that's the time that you believe you know those slaves were so excited and under such anticipation waiting for the hour that they would be free until they tell me they gathered at the bottom of the hill mothers and little children all gathered and some of the old they climbed up on the top of the hill around midnight no smart phones no walkie-talkies no telegraphs they climbed up on the mountain they knowed when the day break and the sun come up that they would be free it wouldn't take over one half of a minute to shine the sun from the top of the hill but some of them was up on the top of the hill watching watching you hear the point he's making it wouldn't have taken them long to figure out down at the bottom of the hill that the sun was coming up that just ain't good enough let me tell you something there's a handful of people in this church that that would never be good enough i don't want to know it when everybody else knows it [Music] god didn't call me to follow the trend he called me to be on the razor edge he called me to be a forerunner i'm talking about you not me me too but i'm talking about you there's some of us that were never waited at the bottom of that hill we'd have done everything we could within our power to get up to the top of the hill to be one of the first that saw the sun come up because we wanted to be one of those that hollered back down [Music] god's just looking for somebody today who'll be a forerunner who'll take him at his word who'll deal with this stuff in the name of the lord jesus christ oh yes it wouldn't take over half a minute to shine the sun from the top of the hill but some of them was up on the top of the hill watching watching oh when the sun rises we are free that was the the s-u-n that was the s-u-n that was the flaming ball of light but when s-o-n rises i got good news for you the s-o-n has risen oh the sun has risen one of these days when the sun rose some 1900 years ago he broke oh my my my my my my my my my you want to sit around here my complex my issues from my childhood my migraine i just remembered another disease that brother branham mentioned about the demonic breaking through in the physical realm arthritis my arthritis my troubled children you want to sit around here and talk like that don't you know the sun is risen it doesn't matter what's going on around you really it doesn't matter if anybody's here to celebrate the victory with you or not this is not about you in the corporate body this is about you and the s-o-n i'm here to tell you today the s-o-n has risen and he has every slave belt in your life if you're wearing the slave belt today you're wearing it by choice you're beating the pool yes i am and i better tell my watch i'm all right well we don't want 9-1-1 to show up if you're wearing a sleigh belt today you are choosing to keep that on it really has no power over you you daughter of zion the yoke that you decorate your neck with is not a yoke to hold you anymore because we read in god's word that yoke was already broken because of the anointing you wear it like a chain you wear it like jewelry around your neck you wear it because slavery has become your identity [Music] you're afraid there are people who are afraid to learn what it means to live in freedom they're afraid that they might have to learn to look at things differently because when you're wearing a slave belt you look at everything like a slave oh i wish somebody was preaching to me i believe i could do a better amen job than some of you are doing this morning if i was sitting where you're sitting because it's the truth and nothing but the truth that slave belt is nothing but a reminder of where you were it is no longer a thermostat of where you are because the s-o-n the s-o-n has risen and he has taken away broke every slave belt he's taken that bond from around our neck and if it's hanging if we're wearing it it's just hanging there the chains are gone isn't that what we found out the lord is coming to this broken daughter of zion and he says to her eyes and she says what do you mean arise i've been laying here just like i was beaten down bloody and bruised and broken with this shackle around my neck what do you mean to rise and shine what do you mean get up and the truth was revealed it's no more than a cage the mirage of a cage i'm preaching it's no more than the mirage of a cage that used to trap you in a 12-foot shuffle but you don't have to be there anymore because the s-o-n has risen jesus has broke every slave belt jesus has broken every bar come on brother sister why don't you give him some praise [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] jesus you're worthy you're worthy [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Applause] don't you stand there and think uh he's just trying to work us out if a believer has to be worked up to praise god something's wrong with the believer [Applause] i'm just trying to encourage you that you're sitting under something that's just a mirage let's be seated a moment he broke every sleigh belt he set every captive free he healed every sickness he gave freedom to those who are in bondage how we ought to climb and watch get to the top of the mountain so you can see that the sun is risen how we ought to climb and watch let me read on a moment and when the sun peeped up first the man was at the highest saw it and he shouted down to the next man we are free someone on youtube said why are those people running around the church we're not insinuating that you have to do that you do you come on we know cultures are different finland some of the believers from scandinavia they almost miss their visitation because brother branham believed in foot washing and the ministerial association didn't want a preacher coming in who believed in foot washing he believed that you take communion you wash the saints feet you get up and praise god and go on your way jesus set the example it's not it's not some salvation ritual it's not some it's you know it's it's not a i would call it an ordinance but i wouldn't necessarily believe that it was a salvation issue and brother branham sent word through the managers and said i don't preach about foot washing everywhere i go i might make a mention of jesus washing the disciples feet or in my tabernacle i have said that the lord's supper shouldn't be taken without the finishing without the rest of what happened there but but he said i wouldn't go around the world saying things like that particularly well we're we're a cold country we're a coal country and we can't imagine putting our bare feet in cold water and then the manager said well it could be hot water but we're not pushing for foot washing we don't do foot washing services out on the on the healing trail we just feel like it's undignified to expect people to unrope their feet and have them washed in church and dried and put their socks and shoes back on and so you know what it was it had nothing to do with foot washing they almost missed their opportunity to have their sick heels [Applause] and yet over here in america mennonites were coming catholics were coming episcopalians were coming lutherans were coming come on they came from every denomination now the pastors didn't necessarily encourage it but people wanted to be healed they wanted to be delivered and they weren't going to let some pentecostal doctrine keep them from coming and getting the blessing of god how stupid of us that's rough talk isn't it how stupid of us to let some little something like that almost cause us to miss our day of visitation well he told me to praise the lord he told me why don't you raise your hand and praise the lord and i just don't like to be told what to do and this and that and the other and all the excuses that people make oh my let it go let it go let it go let it go let it go let all of it go turn loose of it and let it all go and get a hold of jesus today get a hold of him and don't let him go we're free the next man shouted to the man farther down the hill until it come to the camp we are free for the sun was arising they were waiting waiting waiting for that hour how much more last paragraph how much more are we to be waiting today for the son of god we are free from sin we are free from the shackles we are free from habits we are free from smoking and dancing and carousing because the son of god has raised from the grave and has broke every fetter [Music] hallelujah yeah look at the next phrase give me the oh condemnation say it again sister beth is what god the debt has been paid the penalty is paid you want me to come in here and fold my hands and act like some dignified somebody when i found out my slave belt is broken my fetters are gone my habits are dealt with i'm under no condemnation my penalty has been paid my sins are washed away and we are free [Music] we are free people slavery he said freedom when the son of god rises with healing in his wings freedom involves a choice that we must make we know the price is paid we know deliverance is ours we know that satan has ultimately been dealt with by the death and the and the shedding of blood and the resurrection of our lord jesus christ but we have to keep choosing to live like those who are not under the slave belt we have to keep choosing to live differently than those who are under the whip come on driven in life we're free from that it's a choice does anybody not understand what i mean when i say freedom is a choice we need to choose that before we go home today and we need to choose that before we get up in the morning and face this evil hour we might need to choose that before we go to bed tomorrow night because a lot can happen in a day and we might have to choose that every day we might have to keep choosing that because guess what those thoughts are going to keep coming against the accusations of hell are going to keep coming again and so we're going to have to say wait a minute am i going to live look folks there's different kinds of people and i'm closing there's different kinds of people there are some people when they're fasting they want you to know their fasting bible said so that like the pharisees and sadducees of the day of jesus they would get up in the morning and walk around all day with bed head wouldn't even comb their hair i see people like that all the time reckon they're fasting i go to walmart on occasion once a year i see people walking around in their pajamas i do never never combed a hair never brushed a tooth they just showed up i don't understand it i have i have even seen people walk around with a comb in their hair and i'm thinking come over here honey let me just show you what that's for they want everybody to know that they don't they're just you know society just no hold on me i don't have to fit the mold if i want to walk around and look like a zombie i will don't you say nothing about it there's just people like that there's christian religious people like that too if they're fasting they want everybody to know no i'm fasting [Music] let's go to lunch no i'm fasting this week the bible said not to act like that when you're fasting you should get up wash your face comb your hair put on some smell good go live your life in it right right so you're not drawing attention to yourself and there's going to be times that you getting about in a bad spot and you have to you have to say to another believer i'm not eating and of course then you have to deal with folks like us who aren't used to fasting people so much and the next question my wife is going to ask are you sick do we need to pray for you that just recently happened i said to my wife i said no they're fasting we just want people you know we just love equals food you know and we we love you and we think you ought to be eating that's what granny taught us anyway there are people like that they're just built that way and they want everybody to know when they're going through a battle when they're depressed they want everybody to know they're depressed i see sisters sometimes with their hair hanging down in their face and i know that they're sending a message to the whole world how rough life is i see it i see people sometime the way they present themselves and i realize they're just wanting somebody to notice that they're having a hard time and then there are other folks who would rather nobody know so when they're down like i said a while ago they they just find a smile you ever had to do it hold up your hand you just have to find one well in that being a hypocrite no it's being a leader you're just being a leader you're just being example to one another there's going to be times that you don't feel like smiling and you have to smile anyway come on now you just have to because you're not just representing your stuff you're representing a kingdom that's not shaken by the politics of the united states of america you're representing a kingdom now there are going to be times that you've got to have prayer and so you're going to say hey come here there's going to be times that instead of staying at home you're going to limp to church and you're not going to do that because you want attention you're going to do that because you know it's much much much better to limp your way to god's house than to let a limp keep you from coming that's not what i'm talking about i'm talking about people who find some kind of sense of belonging by sending this message my life is hardly worth living but i want you to know something if that is the motto and theme of your life you've got a sleigh belt on you may blame the devil for putting it there but you have no one to blame but yourself for leaving it there because the s-o-n has risen [Applause] [Music] there's not a demon in hell that the blood of jesus can drive from your life there's not a power of darkness or spiritual wickedness in high places it can't be dealt with the weapon of the name of jesus christ lord jesus christ there's not a disease there's not a situation there's not a hardship there's not a complex there's not an insecurity that can be dealt with by the truth of god's word freedom musicians are coming freedom is a choice how can you say so because it's done the price is paid i want to say one more time if you're fighting a battle this morning the reason why we're fighting a battle is we're fighting to show up we're fighting to show up we're fighting to stand up and say god is good you see if the enemy can cause you to doubt that god is good he'll introduce death into the situation just like he did in the garden of eden i want to tell the world god is good oh he's so good he's so good he's so good he's so good and he loves you so much he loves you so much he paid a price and if you'd have been the only one the old timers used to say and i believe if you'd have been the only one he'd died for you he'd have went all the way to the cross for you he just shed his precious blood for you he would have never tried to get out of it and said oh look there's just one who just one who showed up to claim this this wouldn't be worth the effort oh no if you'd have been the only one that would have ever claimed salvation he would have gone all the way to the cross and suffered and been broken and afflicted and tormented and raised from the dead for you to have the victory that's how much he loves you i want you to know sometimes when we want the victory it seems like the victory is out there somewhere and we can't sometimes sometimes we can't we can't seem to chase it down we can't seem to get a hold of it but i want you to know something you got to keep your eyes on it i don't know if you read this testimony that sister shoshanna i'm sorry i say so shoshanna if you read her testimony or not that she posted but 10 years 10 years seems like a lifetime unless you're an abraham and a sarah or unless you're one of the children of israel waiting on the messiah to come 700 years after isaiah's prophecy but for them for her for what was going on in her life 10 years this dream that god had given her was before her and in her heart and anyway you've got to read it i can't tell it's not my not my testimony and i couldn't remember enough of the details you you should read it because it's well written and it's an announcement also of this dream where she saw this girl baby girl and they got the news this week as she has posted that she's indeed carrying that baby girl that she believes that the lord showed her 10 years ago there have been times i'm sure along that way that the victory seemed way off but it wasn't what i want to tell every one of you is it's ours we can't always break through to it we can't always see the fruit of it yet but what do we do we do what she's done we do what they've done we do what others in this room have done we keep our eyes on jesus when we have a reason to shout we shout when we need to cry we cry sometimes we cry while we shout we speak faith we glorify god we edify his name we lift jesus up we keep on keeping on we press through the doubt we push through the gloom we refuse to wear the devil's slave belt come on now we received a mourn like those who have no hope as though it will always be like it is i want you to know seasons change so quickly the ebbs and flows of spiritual life we talked about how your your natural life can change for the bad whether suddenly what if i wanted to tell you that your spiritual life can also change for the good in one of those suddenly moments don't you put your hands on your hip and tell me you no longer believe in it suddenly because you'd be just as foolish as the atheist who declares that he doesn't believe in a god when you and i are over here serving the god who doesn't believe in atheists come on he can turn it around and that is his desire will you choose victory no matter what the circumstances are will you choose to glorify god david mourned he mourned for season and then there come a time that he knew he couldn't change what had taken place and so when they come and got him and told him dinner was ready and he couldn't stay in this condition forever he had a leadership role he got up he washed his face he combed his hair he sat down to eat and he decreed the lord hath given and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord we used to sing this song in the good times praise his name in the bad times do the same let everything that have breath praise the king of kings because he's worthy to be praised let's stand oh my late give god praise go ahead with sister flo give him praise hallelujah jesus

given such a price [Music] there is [Music] it's in the name of jesus oh there is power it's in the name of jesus to break everything he plays break every chance just keep the music going just a moment i don't know how to say this in the right way so you'll just have to hear it how it comes but as we were worshiping and as i was saying some things that i felt like the lord inspired me to say there was something i didn't say i just held on to it for this moment but i felt like the lord wanted to address guilt and the guilt is in a young lady and a female or let me say it this way the guilt goes back to when a woman when a sister was a young lady and it goes back into the i i want to say late teen years there were some things that happened in her life and there's a guilt that she just can't at times break through at times it seems like it's done there were some things that happened and things that you were involved with willingly at the time and god wants to he doesn't want you carrying that anymore if you started if i don't know we're not going to have a confession around here but if you knew some of the stories that you're standing around with and how god is delivered and how god is forgiven multiple partners and some people couldn't even tell you the number or the names but jesus came with his blood with his power so that you don't have to keep walking through the stuff and especially the guilt i want you to give it to the lord right now you don't have to identify yourself but i want you to give it to the lord because this is old stuff this is stuff you haven't walked in for years but the enemy sometimes will slap you with that and i want to see god free you right now and go all the way back to about 16 or 17 years old and deliver some of that guilt and roll it off of you so you can see yourself as a beautiful trophy of god's grace and forgiveness and power and the enemy is using that very strategically because he only brings that against you when you reach a certain place in your spiritual life and he uses that to beat you back down i would like for you to grab a hold of the promise of god for your life and step out from under the chains of guilt today and say that i don't even know that person i don't even know that person that person is so far gone because of the blood of jesus i don't even know that person i want you to sing that again maybe your brother maybe you've got the same kind of guilt but this was addressed specifically to a female but there may be somebody else at the enemy uses guilt against your life when you start trying to grow in him you take authority over that today don't wait till you get home now while we're still in the atmosphere and you tell the enemy i'm not going to keep chewing that you better you better change the menu i'm not going to continue to chew that over and over and over again sing a little more of that and i'm going to believe god to meet you right where you are you reach up to him no matter what your need is no matter what your need is reach up to him right now don't you be ashamed to raise your hand in the name of jesus [Music] memories [Music] to break every chain [Music]
