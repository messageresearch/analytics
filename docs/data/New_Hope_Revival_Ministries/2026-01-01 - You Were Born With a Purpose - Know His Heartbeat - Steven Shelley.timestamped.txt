[0:00] But I want you to know there's a power
[0:02] that's bigger, that's more potent than
[0:06] anything that we could experience in our
[0:09] everyday life.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; And we need him. It's not an it. We need
[0:14] him.
[0:15] &gt;&gt; We need to know that he's there. And we
[0:17] need to know that we've surrendered
[0:19] &gt;&gt; to our purpose. You were born for a
[0:21] reason.
[0:22] &gt;&gt; You were born with a why. I would guess
[0:25] that your why has something to do with
[0:27] the kingdom of God. And you may be
[0:30] running in another direction today, but
[0:32] I want you to know God can run faster
[0:35] than anybody.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "IF YOU WERE TO MAKE YOUR BED
[0:39] in hell, I know where to find you.
[0:41] &gt;&gt; If you were TO TAKE THE WINGS OF A DOVE
[0:43] AND TRY TO FLY away from my presence, I
[0:46] know exactly how to bring you right down
[0:48] when I'm ready to do something for you."
[0:50] Brother Shelley, is it important to know
[0:52] who God is? You're mighty right. It's
[0:54] important to know who he is. And if you
[0:56] don't know who he is, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO
[0:58] YOU SERVE.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; And you DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT HE'S
[1:01] CAPABLE of doing. And you don't
[1:03] understand what he requires out of you.
[1:06] I PROMISE YOU THIS MORNING, you're not
[1:08] here to be your own man.
[1:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10] &gt;&gt; You're not here to be your own woman.
[1:12] You're here at this time for a purpose
[1:15] and for a reason, and that is to glorify
[1:17] God, your creator. SO WHY DON'T WE
[1:19] SURRENDER? WHY DON'T WE SURRENDER TODAY?
[1:23] Why don't we make UP OUR MIND? I'M NOT
[1:24] going to live another ordinary day on
[1:26] planet Earth serving sin and self, BUT
[1:30] I'M GOING TO SERVE the living God, the
[1:34] creator of all mankind, the only one
[1:37] that promises something beyond the
[1:39] grave. To feel his heart,
[1:43] to feel his heartbeat, TO KNOW THAT HE
[1:46] HAS A MIND, to know that he has a will,
[1:49] TO KNOW THAT HE HAS A PURPOSE for us in
[1:52] these last days. Brother, that's why I
[1:54] get out of bed every morning is to give
[1:57] him everything I have. He's worthy of
[2:00] it. In order to do so, Jesus said, "If
[2:03] you're going to come after me, you're
[2:05] going to have to deny yourself. You're
[2:07] going to have to be delivered from your
[2:09] own selfishness, and you're going to
[2:11] have to follow me." Now, when we were
[2:14] not serving the Lord, we were selfish.
[2:20] And some of us, even though we uh, you
[2:23] know, play serving the Lord, we're still
[2:26] selfish. And God said through Jesus in
[2:30] this scripture, if you're going to
[2:31] follow me, you're going to have to deny
[2:33] yourself. And nobody really likes the
[2:36] concept. But I want you to know, if
[2:38] you're willing to lay down your will and
[2:40] take his will, he'll fill you with his
[2:43] love divine.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; He'll fill you with the Holy Spirit.
[2:48] He'll put a fire down in your heart and
[2:50] he'll lead your footsteps and direct
[2:53] your life and you can live in his favor
[2:56] and in his pleasure.
[2:58] &gt;&gt; It's not about living to the church.
[3:00] It's about living unto him.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; But the end is UPON US. THE CONSUMMATION
[3:05] OF THE AGES is breaking forth in this
[3:08] hour.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; And the world is more insane and matter
[3:12] and wilder than it's ever been. And the
[3:15] heathen will continue to rage. And what
[3:18] happens out there, IT MUST NOT AFFECT
[3:21] WHAT happens in here. But what God does
[3:24] for us in here, IT MUST CERTAINLY AFFECT
[3:27] WHAT'S HAPPENING out there. And the ONLY
[3:30] WAY IT CAN IS for us to take this with
[3:32] us.
[3:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:34] &gt;&gt; It's not our for and no more. And it's
[3:37] not the boundaries of the four walls of
[3:39] this church that we're concerned about.
[3:41] It's getting this life outside this
[3:44] building.
[3:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
