========================================

Description:
We have an open invitation to come behind the veil into the Holy of Holies, not because we are worthy, but because our ‘Lamb’ is worthy.  When we repent, have been baptized in the Name of Jesus Christ, and have met all the requirements of Scripture, He made us a promise, ‘I will meet you in there’.  Jesus Christ Himself, the Shekinah Glory will meet us in that little room behind the veil.

That unveiling is not to the crowd at large, that unveiling is to each individual member of the Bride of Christ.
