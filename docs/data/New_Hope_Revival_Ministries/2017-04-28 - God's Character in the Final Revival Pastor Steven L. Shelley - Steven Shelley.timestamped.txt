[0:02] so what do you believe will be the sign
[0:06] of the last great move of God it will be
[0:09] a
[0:10] people who not only pray for the sick or
[0:13] speak words of healing and deliverance
[0:16] and have visions and and the gifts
[0:18] operate in their life but greater than
[0:20] that higher than that more effective
[0:24] than that more powerful than that and
[0:27] rarer than anything else that's ever
[0:29] happened in the church there will be a
[0:31] people who come forth to demonstrate
[0:35] this
[0:38] life and what is this life it is the
[0:43] character that's it it is the character
[0:47] and the attributes of Jesus
[0:51] Christ so will there be healing in
[0:53] Miracles yes but they're going to come
[0:55] in a different way than they have come
[0:57] in times past they're not just going to
[0:59] come by the anointing of oil and the
[1:01] laying on of hands they're going to come
[1:03] by the power of the spoken creative word
[1:07] because there's going to be a bride
[1:09] manifesting the attributes and the
[1:12] character of Jesus Christ so yes there's
[1:16] going to be healing and yes there's
[1:17] going to be Miracles when God begins to
[1:20] manifest himself it's going to be from
[1:23] within you that he moves he's going to
[1:25] move from within you to the outside and
[1:28] as he does that it's going to to be his
[1:30] character coming forth and so it's going
[1:32] to be all about integrity it's going to
[1:35] be all about truth it's not going to be
[1:37] about little perfect people born perfect
[1:39] it's going to be about people that have
[1:41] been through the water and they didn't
[1:43] drown and they' been through the fire
[1:45] and the fire couldn't burn them and
[1:47] they've climbed the mountain and slid
[1:49] down the other side and they've walked
[1:50] through the valleys of the Shadows of
[1:52] death and they have faced persecution
[1:55] and lies against who they were and what
[1:57] they believe and they have suffered many
[1:59] things and some of them have had their
[2:01] bodies twisted and mangled by pain and
[2:04] by heartache and by loss and by grief
[2:07] and by daddy issues and mother issues
[2:10] and rejection issues and insecurity
[2:13] issues and inferiority issues and
[2:16] disqualification issues and all that
[2:18] goes with living here in sa zeden and
[2:21] yet they're going to come through by the
[2:23] blood of the lamb and by the word of
[2:26] their testimony and the greatest
[2:28] demonstration of God's power hour it's
[2:30] going to be quick and it's going to be
[2:34] short and it's going to call in the last
[2:36] of the bride and it's going to release
[2:39] the final Harvest of souls that planet
[2:42] earth has seen
