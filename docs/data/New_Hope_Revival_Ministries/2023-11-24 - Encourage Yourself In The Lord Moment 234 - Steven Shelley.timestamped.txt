[0:00] but the Bible tells us that David
[0:03] encouraged himself in the
[0:08] Lord what does it look like to encourage
[0:11] yourself in the Lord and I just imagine
[0:15] that David stood there for just a
[0:19] moment but all of the sudden there was
[0:21] something that dropped into
[0:23] him
[0:25] Lord when I was a younger
[0:28] man and I was was watching over my
[0:31] father's
[0:32] sheep there was a lion that came and
[0:35] wanted to rip my sheep in pieces and
[0:38] Destroy them but somehow you gave me the
[0:41] strength to grab him by the beard and
[0:44] kill him and you also gave me that same
[0:47] kind of strength when a bear was going
[0:49] to do the same thing when the Paw of the
[0:52] bear was about to take out one of my
[0:54] sheep and somehow God you gave me the
[0:57] strength that to be able to to kill
[1:01] those two and Lord I also want to remind
[1:04] you that I was out in that sheep pasture
[1:07] and I was minding my own business and
[1:11] you you had already taken your hand off
[1:14] of Saul and you sent the prophet Samuel
[1:17] to my daddy's house and when you sent
[1:20] him to my D's Daddy's house I was just
[1:23] out in the sheepfield watching over my
[1:25] sheep and all my brothers were at home
[1:28] but Samuel came down to the house and he
[1:30] was going to anoint a new king because
[1:33] you told him that it would be among the
[1:35] sons of Jesse and so Lord I was just
[1:39] minding my business and they came out
[1:42] after everyone Samuel had looked over
[1:45] all of my brothers and you chose me out
[1:49] of all of my brothers to be king and
[1:52] Samuel when I came into the house Samuel
[1:56] poured that horn of
[1:57] oil over my head and he said you're the
[2:01] next king of
[2:02] Israel
[2:05] Lord I didn't ask for that
[2:08] position but you're the one that said it
[2:10] I was minding my own business but you
[2:13] are the one that anointed me to be the
[2:16] next king and here I am running from I'm
[2:19] running from Saul but I'm still to be
[2:21] the next king and Lord I want to also
[2:25] remind you that when when Saul was in a
[2:29] place where that he couldn't get a hold
[2:31] of you I went and I played my harp and I
[2:33] sang to try to calm the demon spirits
[2:37] that were in him but Lord I also want to
[2:39] remind you that somehow when my brothers
[2:44] and all of the army of Israel they were
[2:46] scared of
[2:48] Goliath there was something that when I
[2:52] went down to the camp and I saw that all
[2:55] of them were afraid to fight Goliath
[2:57] there was something that came over me
[3:00] Lord and you gave me the strength to not
[3:03] be afraid you took all of the fear out
[3:06] of my life and you gave me the courage
[3:09] to go down to that Brook and to get five
[3:12] smooth
[3:14] stones to pick up those
[3:18] stones you gave me the courage Lord when
[3:22] that giant lifted his voice and it
[3:25] rumbled and reverberated through that
[3:27] Valley enough to shake every one of my
[3:31] brothers it did not Shake Me Lord
[3:34] because you gave me the courage that I
[3:36] didn't necessarily have but you gave me
[3:39] the courage and David's just reminding
[3:41] the Lord of all of those things that he
[3:44] has already done for him all those
[3:46] things that he's already done on his
[3:48] behalf even though right now all around
[3:50] him is a mess the women are gone they
[3:53] don't know where they're at his men are
[3:54] ready to Stone him but David encouraged
[3:57] himself in the Lord because David was
[4:00] running his race with patience he had
[4:02] already been anointed
[4:05] [Music]
[4:07] king you have already been anointed
[4:12] bride he had already been anointed king
[4:15] but he was still running from
[4:17] [Music]
[4:21] Saul you have been
[4:23] anointed as priests and Kings but you're
[4:26] still defeating devils in your life
[4:29] you're still putting them down run this
[4:32] race with patience the race that is set
[4:35] before you encourage yourself in the
[4:37] Lord how do I do that brother remind the
[4:41] Lord and the
[4:43] devil of all of the times that God has
[4:47] come through for you remind him of your
[4:51] salvation remind him of your Holy Ghost
[4:54] experience remind him of the refilling
[4:57] that God has given you along the way
[5:00] remind
[5:02] him
[5:05] who the devil yeah God yeah remind both
[5:10] of
[5:11] them does God need reminding probably
[5:14] not does the devil need reminding
[5:17] probably
[5:18] not I think he's probably still nursing
[5:21] the
[5:24] wounds of when some of us got
[5:27] [Music]
[5:28] delivered and he's pulled and he's
[5:31] yanked and he's jerked and he's pulled
[5:33] and he's yanked and he's jerked trying
[5:35] to get you to get back to the place
[5:37] where you once were he's trying to get
[5:40] you to take your eyes off of Jesus and
[5:43] get your eyes on your circumstances and
[5:45] he's trying to get you to be impatient
[5:47] with your journey so that you'll quit
[5:49] and go back to Egypt that you'll try to
[5:52] find a leader that will take you back to
[5:56] Egypt but run this race with patience
[6:00] run this race with patience the race
[6:03] that is set before you looking unto
[6:05] Jesus and away from your
[6:07] circumstances looking away from your
[6:11] circumstances and unto Jesus who is the
[6:14] author and the finisher of your
[6:16] [Music]
[6:27] faith
