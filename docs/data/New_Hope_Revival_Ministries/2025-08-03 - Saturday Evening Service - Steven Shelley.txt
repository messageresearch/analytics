We exist for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And as we ponder how big &gt;&gt; the universe is, &gt;&gt; how big you are, &gt;&gt; but you chose to come into this realm, into this world, because you had a purpose. You had something on your mind. It was people that you forneew, &gt;&gt; that you loved. Amen. &gt;&gt; You came here to redeem those that were a part of you. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And that you wanted to spend eternity with. I thank you for the price you paid. one love. &gt;&gt; There's nothing more important right now in this life than to love you, &gt;&gt; to honor you, to follow you, to seek you. &gt;&gt; But Father, we were helpless without you. &gt;&gt; And right now, we're helpless without you. But you made a way. &gt;&gt; What an honor, Lord, to carry your life today. &gt;&gt; Amen. What an honor to be co-airs with Christ. &gt;&gt; You purposed to give us a kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And in that kingdom there is unlimited resources. And right now we have healing and wholeness and deliverance. But it's when we focus on you, when we put our all our trust in you and your ability. So right now, every hand and I saw every hand &gt;&gt; raised up &gt;&gt; because we need you. &gt;&gt; We need you. And even before we pray, you know our needs. &gt;&gt; Whatever we need the most right now, Father, I ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that would you you would come with your supernatural grace. you would stir our inner man, energize our inner man that we can reach out to faith and for the all the promises that we need right now in our lives. Would you would you heal those that need healing in their physical body? &gt;&gt; It's nothing to you. &gt;&gt; Unlimited power. &gt;&gt; We're singing about resurrection power. Father, let the resurrection life that is in Christ Jesus manifest in these bodies right now in Jesus' name. &gt;&gt; Any mental hurdle, oppression, &gt;&gt; be broken in the authority of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And Father, for this meeting, I just pray you would come among us as we've been praising and pressing through. I can just sense the atmosphere getting better and better and better.

Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Oh, falling in love with Jesus was the best thing I've ever done. Oh, thank you, Lord. He was the best thing I've ever done. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [Music] You know, sometimes we feel like we haven't done a lot of good things in our life. Not nearly enough. But I'll tell you, I did something good one day. I I I did the best thing the day I said yes to him &gt;&gt; when I took off the old robe and put on the new one. &gt;&gt; How many of you know that was the best thing anybody could ever ever ever do? And to keep falling in love with him. It's a it's a it's it's something that continues to happen. It's that there's an ing on the end of it. falling in love. You may be seated tonight. It's wonderful. You look so good. It's so wonderful to see you in the house of the Lord this evening. His presence is here. He has a reason for you being here. &gt;&gt; Just like he has a reason for me being here. &gt;&gt; We're not here by happen stance. &gt;&gt; We're here by appointment. &gt;&gt; May God have his wonderful way. One of these sisters from North Carolina, the one with the beautiful gray hair is Sister Penny. And uh her sister-in-law is an old friend of ours here. She has been here many times, Sister Evelyn Fox. And Sister Penny is her sister-in-law. And And is this your first time here, Sister Penny? You were here years ago. Almost a lifetime ago. Long time ago. I was young once. I didn't have gray. We're so happy to have you ladies here that you'd come and make this. Uh there are you both from brother All of you from brother Adams. They're from brother Adam Knight's church. Let's welcome them again. He's here. &gt;&gt; Let's see what he'll do for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you all. I'm just uh under under a little something and it's good. Aren't you glad that he inspires us? &gt;&gt; I loved what brother Gley said about this miracle pew back there. I I it makes me want to tell him to slide over and let me go sit with them. Miracle book ends there on the end. God is so good. Are you going to play You're going to play the piano? I thought you might let somebody else play. Yeah. Go ahead then. No practicing. I've been aware. Let me say this beautiful introduction. Let me say this first and do it again. Just like that. I've been aware. You know, sometimes we we're aware. Sometimes we're not aware. Sometimes we have entertained angels unaware. How many of you feel like in your life there have been times that God sent help? You're not sure if it was human or angel. &gt;&gt; When our boys were in the terrible wreck in the truck and flipped the truck and rolled the truck, there was someone who come and cut the seat belt for one of them to get out. And when they finally got out and we got there pretty quick to thank the person, they were gone. We don't know if they got in the car and rode on or if it was otherwise. We have sometimes entertained them unaware. But isn't it wonderful when we get this sense in our heart that they're with us? &gt;&gt; Sometimes when brother Brandham was praying, he would say, and I've heard brother Greley say it too, may the angels of the Lord come and take up their position around the walls of this house tonight. On every pew, position themselves here. Uh if our eyes could be open this evening, there is another realm that's running parallel with the one you and I are communicating in right now. It's not a million miles away. No, no. That dimension is running parallel right through this place tonight. If our eyes could be opened, if our ears could be open to it, we would we would see into that realm where there is a heavenly host &gt;&gt; who come to help us, who come to watch over us lest we dash our foot against a stone. The dangerous roads. There were a few times on the way to church, we left about 10 till 5 and as we were getting there at Bleecker, we couldn't see. We couldn't see ahead of us. The rain was so hard and cars were pulled over and the water was wa washing so fast across the road. It was washing big rocks right out into the road there for a little while. And we just began to pray. I prayed for all of you that God would watch over you and keep you and bring you here safely. That you would be wise. Lord, I said make them wiser than they normally are so that they're just not taking any risk. Just driving slow even if they're late. This was one night you could have been late. Nobody would have said a word, but he he made a way for you to be here. And I've just been in my own personal life, I've been aware sometimes we see, sometimes we see. But if you never were to see an angel, know that there we don't worship angels. I don't fill my homes with statues and paintings of angels like some people do, but I like to be aware of the fact that we have we have help from another realm, &gt;&gt; from another dimension. &gt;&gt; And I sensed one even today and I don't know why uh he was around, but I'm thankful that he was. You've got at least one. And some of you are so accidentrone and uh risktaking that you must have a bunch assigned to you. But isn't he faithful? He knows what we need. This is an old song. [Music] When I'm broken from the battle and I've lost a another round, Satan whispers to my troubled mind. Why don't you lay your armor down? Where are those you loved and trusted? Look around you. They are gone. It would be easy to surrender when you're standing all alone. But I see a great band of angels camp all around me. &gt;&gt; Oh, and I see my captain rising up this challenge to me. Oh, and I know I'm safe from harm when I'm touching Jesus. Oh, the battle is his, but the victory is mine and victory is sweet. [Music] Then I bow my head in sadness while I ponder, what will I do? I've been in God's army for so long. I've tried to be a soldier true. That's when I hear a sweet voice from heaven saying, "Pilgrim, it is I." Lift your head and take you courage. Lift your eyes toward the sky where I see a great band of angels camp all around me. Thank God they're here and I see my captain rising up [Music] to me. I know I'm safe from harm when I'm touching Jesus. Oh, the battle is his, but the victory is mine and victory is sweet. So I bow my head in sadness while I ponder what to do. Where are my friends gone? I've been in God's army for so long. I've tried to be a soldier. True. That's when I hear a sweet voice from heaven saying, "Pilgrim, it is I." Lift your head and take new courage. Lift your eyes toward the sky where I see a great band of angels cam all around me. You may not see them, but they're with you. Oh, I see my &gt;&gt; captain this challenge to me. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the challenge is. I know I'm safe from harm when I'm touching Jesus. [Music] Oh, the battle is but the victory is mine. Victory is sweet. Sing the chorus again. Oh, I see a great man of angels kept hold around me. &gt;&gt; I see my captain challenge to me. &gt;&gt; To me. &gt;&gt; I know I'm safe. from harm when I'm touching Jesus. Oh, the battle is his, but the victory is mine. I know the battle is his, but the victory is mine. &gt;&gt; I said the battle is his, but the victory is mine. And victory is sweet. [Music] Hallelujah. [Music] [Applause] Oh, thank you. Thank you, Captain Jesus. Woo! Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; He's the Lord of hosts. &gt;&gt; He's the God of angel armies. &gt;&gt; He commands them all. &gt;&gt; You and I, we're not commanding angels. &gt;&gt; We don't have to. Our captain does it on our behalf. &gt;&gt; All we have to do is say, "Help, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord. Lord, we need you. I don't even think he has to send out a decree to you. Just nods his head and there they come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm so thankful tonight we're not in this alone. &gt;&gt; He surrounds us. &gt;&gt; He surrounds us. &gt;&gt; Oh, God bless you. Are you ready for the word tonight? Before we do, would you give thanks to God for these amazing musicians and their gifts and talents are huge. We're grateful for them. They're faithful. &gt;&gt; They come early. They're willing to run through something, not to perform. But if you're going to give the king something, &gt;&gt; you ought to give him the best you can come up with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a big preacher on praise. I like to preach on praise. &gt;&gt; But I'm not so much for that hallelujah anyhow praise. The one that says, well, you know, praise the Lord anyhow. No, no, no. It's exuberant praise. The Bible said, "Let the high praises of God be in your mouth." &gt;&gt; A two-edged sword in your hand. How many of you know you've got the sword &gt;&gt; and you've got the word in your mouth &gt;&gt; and the high praises come out sometime? &gt;&gt; I like it. I can't sing it or I would, but I like that little old chorus. Uh I mean, it's it's older than you realize, but but it has had a breath of fresh air, I guess, the last few years. Uh, I got to praise. Got to praise. Got to let it out. Got to let it out. I don't know how to do it, but have you ever had one and you and you were in a place where you couldn't let it out? &gt;&gt; I've had them come on me in a funeral before. What did you do? I just let it out. &gt;&gt; I knew it wouldn't bother the one we were there to honor, &gt;&gt; right? It bo might have bothered the family. But listen, when you've got something locked up inside of you, the goodness of God &gt;&gt; that follows you everywhere you go, you've got a right to praise him. &gt;&gt; And we who have seen the unveiling of Jesus Christ, the apocalypsis, that that unveiling of Christ the word. uh when you have received anointed Isav to open up your eyes and let you see that he's not a historical figure. He's a living reality moving among us tonight. You can't offer God some old dried up praise. &gt;&gt; You want to give him everything, don't you? &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn in your Bible this evening. Uh you don't know how desperately hard I tried to convince the Lord uh to do something else this evening. I I guess I I it's a good thing. I'm blessed that I came away without a a limp in my hip because at times I felt like I was wrestling because I think it's nice when you people come. A lot of you, some of you are faithful streamers. And when you get to come and be in the atmosphere, I I always, it's just nice if if I'm speaking to maybe do something a little different than what we're working on as a congregation at the time. But he won again. And I am going to take it in a slightly different turn this evening, but we're going to start at the same place. We are in a series that is from Jeremiah 48:1. If you will will show that to them. I can't see the end of it in sight, but eventually we will be done with it. But it has been uh it's been something that God has used in my life. He first gave me the message when I was just a small boy. And I've got the scribbled notes on my desk uh to prove that he did. But we're taking it a little bit further in the last few weeks. I want you to look at it with me and then we'll give you your seat in just a moment. Verse 11 said, "Mo hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his leaves, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity. Therefore, his taste remained in him and his scent, his fragrance is not changed. Now, if you know anything about Moab, the man in the Bible, he was perverse. He did terrible things. And yet, he was minimally judged. his people, his descendants lived on the other side of the Jordan River where you know the story when there was no bread in in Bethlehem, Bethlehem, the house of bread, Naomi and went across, you remember, and her sons and they married Moabitetish women and Moab was just sort of off the radar and uh they had done some continued to do some awful things. They had a knowledge to do better. They were cousins to the chosen of the Lord. And yet, they'd never gone into captivity. They'd never really paid for their mess. And and therefore, the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, and he began to tell them, "You're going to pay. You've got to pay for some of this business that you've been doing, and now your time is coming. And I'm warning you ahead of time. Isn't God good to give us warning before judgment? &gt;&gt; He's faithful. I want you to look if you will to again to Psalm 66. I'm going to read uh three verses there and then just a quick word of prayer. This is a beautiful expression of what God is doing when he puts us in tight places. For thou, oh God, hast proved us. Have you been proven? Come on. &gt;&gt; Thou hast tried us. Have you been tried? &gt;&gt; As silver is tried. &gt;&gt; Thou broughtest us. I heard that little amen from somebody over there. Wasn't that good? Praise the Lord for that amen. &gt;&gt; Thou broughtest us into the net. Thou laidest affliction upon our loins. Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads. We went through fire and water, but thou brought us Hallelujah. But thou brought us out into a wealthy place. &gt;&gt; Other translators say, a broad place, a place where there's plenty of elbow room. Hallelujah. A place where your spiritual jurisdiction has been expanded. God gives you authority to speak into situations that you never had any authority in before. Come on. &gt;&gt; And you didn't get that way because you were good-looking. You got that way because you've been tried like silver is tried. Tested like God's children are tested. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're one of his? &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you this evening that you are here. Oh, with all these beautiful faces here, we are delighted. But Lord, if we would come together and you wouldn't come with us, what would be the use? What would be the reason to gather? You're the reason we gather. You're the reason why we get up in the morning. You're the reason why we continue to move and raise our families to love you and to serve you. It's all about you. Sometimes when I am praying and I'm saying, "Lord, it's all about you. It's all about you." I hear a distant voice that echoes back to me from eternity, my Lord. And it says, "It's all about my bride. It's all about my bride." That's what makes this relationship so beautiful is we are focused on you and you are focused on us and we are coming together in a holy union that the world will never understand. It's only to those who are called for only the called see their need for a more close relationship with you than church annity has to offer. Come today, Lord. I want to be poured out of this vessel into another vessel, leaving behind all of the leaves, all of the dregs, all of the reasons why we had to go through the things we've been through. I surely don't want to carry any stubbornness with me, any rebellion with me, any bitterness with me, any offense with me. So help us tonight. Your little bride is turning a corner again. And we know that something is moving among us for eternal purposes. And we have a fear. It's not a fear that would uh cause us to hide in a corner. It's a reverential fear. We have a reverential fear that we would not offend you, that we would not get in your way, that we would not seek glory for ourselves. We say today, may the lamb receive the reward for his suffering. May the lamb receive the reward for his suffering. May the lamb receive the reward for his suffering. We ask it in the name above every name. Bashim Adonai Yeshua Hamashiach. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. And the saint said, &gt;&gt; you may be seated this evening. We are often finding ourselves in tight places, squeezed places because God is doing something, expanding something in us, multiplying something in us, and we don't want to be satisfied with where we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. Naomi Seigo and her family live just a few hours from here in Georgia. And I can hear him singing in my mind sometime. I want my Lord to be satisfied with me. How many of you want him to be satisfied with every part of your life? What else is there to live for? If you're living for anything other than the kingdom of the Lord to bring honor and glory to the lamb that he might receive the reward for his suffering, then your living is in vain. &gt;&gt; But as the old song said, if I can help one somebody, &gt;&gt; if I can just help one somebody along the way, then my living will not be in vain. &gt;&gt; How many of you know that's just a desire of a Christian? &gt;&gt; And it's not preaching to them that they necessarily need. it's living in front of them. &gt;&gt; The the biggest excuse that people give for not wanting anything to do with church is they say the church is full of hypocrites &gt;&gt; and they're not too far off in a lot of cases. &gt;&gt; You can say amen or o me. &gt;&gt; But as I tell them when they tell me that, well, the problem is at least the hypocrite is in church. &gt;&gt; So that means the hypocrite is closer to God than you are. So why don't you at least go and see what God will do in your life. &gt;&gt; Somebody is looking for a sermon lived. &gt;&gt; There's a whole generation out there that's looking for a sermon that's lived. &gt;&gt; And here we claim to have the highest revelation of all the church ages. And yet we can't even get along with one another. Amen. Brother, &gt;&gt; we we just we're just too carnal, it seems. &gt;&gt; I heard a prophet say, "We've gone as far with God as we're ever going to go until we're willing to pay a greater price." &gt;&gt; Everybody says, "Amen." But few people get in the line. &gt;&gt; To pay a greater price. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "You mean I've served the Lord 40 years and there's more of me he wants?" He wants all. &gt;&gt; You've heard about the Native American that give his heart to the Lord, haven't you? And uh he he he got moved under the missionaries preaching and uh he heard the missionaries say, "God wants you to give everything." And and so they they found him one day under the brush arbor uh with the around the altar. He heard the preacher say, "God wants everything." So, he had brought his possessions. He laid his teepee, his bed roll. He He even said, "Lord, I'll go get my horse and lead him to the altar if that's what you want." And finally, he had no satisfaction. He had no peace. And he couldn't think of anything else that he wanted that he had that he owned that God would even want. And in his desperation, he crawled up on the altar and lay up there on the altar himself. &gt;&gt; And that's when a piece came and a voice spoke in his inner being and said, "Now, that's what I wanted all the time. &gt;&gt; I didn't need your teepee. &gt;&gt; I didn't need your bed roll. I didn't need your pony. &gt;&gt; I was after you. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. The bridegroom is after you. He has an appointment with you. &gt;&gt; Just a minute. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He has an appointment with us &gt;&gt; in these last days. &gt;&gt; The way some of them preach, you'd think that this little bride is going to fizzle out. And then in the night when no one's looking, he's going to slip us little defeated failures out of here to go live in eternity with him. He He's embarrassed. They The way they preach sometime, I think they they think the Lord is embarrassed of us because we're not overcoming. But that's not the way I see it at all. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a final one final shaking, one final quick short hallelujah, glory, praise God move. &gt;&gt; And the bride's going out of here. Not as a fizzling, defeated, pitiful, &gt;&gt; worthy of sympathy bride, &gt;&gt; but one who has recognized who he is &gt;&gt; and who she is because of who he is. &gt;&gt; She's going to stop her gossiping. &gt;&gt; She's going to have to. &gt;&gt; She's going to have to. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The old holiness preachers used to say, "If you can't get to victory, come up here, lay your tongue on the altar." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I ain't seen anybody laying their tongue on the altar lately. But whatever it takes, &gt;&gt; just lay it right up there and say, "God, put a fire on it." &gt;&gt; I'm talking too much about what I don't know anything about. Let the fire of God. Isaiah the prophet. Uh let the fire of God come and touch my lips. &gt;&gt; Amen. I had my confidence in Uzziah and Uzziah is gone. Now Lord, will you come and put an angel with colds of fire? Let him touch it to my mouth that I might be purified. That I might be sanctified. that I might speak life &gt;&gt; instead of death. &gt;&gt; Did you know one word of life into a situation where there's only shadows can bring such resurrection? Such anastasis is the Greek word. When we hear the scriptures in the New Testament in the epistles about resurrection, the word is often there's several words for resurrection, but one is anastasis. And when you see it, if you have a lexicon or you you've got some kind of app you click on and it'll give you what the root word, if it says anything like anastasis, it's talking about a resurrection, the resurrection life that was in Jesus Christ. And it's talking about the reality of that resurrection being reproduced &gt;&gt; in your life. Not just when your graveyard dead either, &gt;&gt; but we ought to live. We ought to breathe. We ought to move with a reproducible resurrection on the inside of us. &gt;&gt; There's a revelation that vibrates &gt;&gt; that has life to it. And it's in the bride of Christ in this hour. Oh, the denominational systems can hoop and holler and carry on. But here's one thing they cannot do. They cannot call for a rapture. It can't call for a rapture. &gt;&gt; But one of these days there's going to be a bride who'll move in such you She's here. &gt;&gt; She's here. She's just being squeezed. &gt;&gt; She's just She's got some leaves to leave behind, some drags that have got to be left behind. And we get comfortable in our in our wine vessel and we don't want to have to go somewhere else, be poured into some other situation. We always complain when it rains it pours. How many of you hear that all the time? &gt;&gt; Rains it pours. If it's not one thing, it's another. I don't know how I can handle anything else. Oh my, I feel so for you. You You hear Christian people speaking death all the time. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about Norman Vincent Peele's form of positive confession. I'm talking about the New Testament form of positive confession, &gt;&gt; speaking life into situations that look hopeless. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. There is a life in you if you're a Holy Ghost fil believer. &gt;&gt; There's a life in you that can not only raise the physical dead, but it has the grace to raise a promise, a dead promise in you. something God said to you and you've given up on it because it's been so long and you're wondering if it's &gt;&gt; you're wondering if it's ever going to come to pass. And God said, "Hold on. Don't you dare throw the towel in now. Hold on. There's a promise." Hallelujah. There's a word of deliverance. There's a word of resurrection that's heading your way. Get it. &gt;&gt; Catch it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, he's pouring us from vessel to vessel, situation to situation. The first vessel, we've covered it well, is the vessel of misunderstanding. &gt;&gt; I know you've never been misunderstood. But a few of us have lived for at least 35, 40 years under the veil of misunderstanding. Here's what you need to know. It don't have to be the truth for somebody to tell it about you. If you don't act just like everybody else, if you don't do church just like everybody else does church, &gt;&gt; sometimes if you sing anything that's newer than the 70s, &gt;&gt; they have something to say about you &gt;&gt; and you get worked up. I've gotten worked up before. We feel the need to defend ourselves. And every time we jump up to defend ourselves, God says, "Uhuh, you're not done yet. &gt;&gt; You haven't been misunderstood enough yet." &gt;&gt; So, some of us have been in this place for 35, 40 years. All we've known seems like is being misunderstood. Family misunderstand you. The job, co-workers misunderstand you, boss misunderstand you, fa wife, husband, children, grandchildren. Come on. &gt;&gt; You're trying to be a sincere Christian. They call you a fanatic. They look at you like you've lost your mind. &gt;&gt; You're following some dead man or something. They've got always something to say. &gt;&gt; And it's not easy in the moment. So, we rise up to try to defend ourselves. And the minute we do, we've just extended our our trip around the mountain. We've just extended our wilderness of misunderstanding because we're going to experience that kind of of perfection, that kind of cleansing, that kind of pressure until we come out with a plate. We don't just doesn't even matter &gt;&gt; what people say about us. &gt;&gt; You believe you can fall so in love with Jesus &gt;&gt; that you don't care. &gt;&gt; You don't care what nobody else says. You don't care who understands you and who doesn't understand you. You just know you love him. You got to have him. You got to have more of him. You got to spend time with him. You got to praise him. You got to dance for him. You got to shout for him and sing for him and live for him. Testify for him &gt;&gt; because you love him. They'll call you religious, &gt;&gt; fanatic, neurotic. &gt;&gt; You're looking like you don't know. Oh, yeah. They're saying it about you. &gt;&gt; I'm looking around. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I see some here tonight. They're saying it about you. You You're neurotic. &gt;&gt; If they don't know where to put you, they'll just say you're on the scale. They the world misunderstands zeal, &gt;&gt; passion. &gt;&gt; Now, make sure you've got a zeal according to knowledge, &gt;&gt; which is a relational knowledge, not a head knowledge. &gt;&gt; You can get a lot of head knowledge and be an educated fool. &gt;&gt; And that's not what God's calling us to. He's calling us to a kind of knowledge that only comes by relationship. It comes by experience. &gt;&gt; The Bible talks about Mary, the mother of Jesus. And it specifically says in the New Testament, she knew no man. How many of you know that doesn't mean that she didn't have any male family members. &gt;&gt; It didn't mean that she didn't know any men in the community. &gt;&gt; That knowing is a different kind of knowing. &gt;&gt; It's not a head knowing. &gt;&gt; It's an intimate knowing. It's the kind that only takes place in the nuptual chamber. &gt;&gt; It's you. It's you and him. &gt;&gt; And if that if the gender thing gets you all messed up, just just don't even worry about it. Because if a a man can be a part of the bride of Christ, a woman can be a son of God. &gt;&gt; Simple. &gt;&gt; In relationship, this isn't about gender. In office, in ministry, in demonstration, there may be some gender things that we should consider, but in relationship, &gt;&gt; there should be no no boundaries &gt;&gt; for either male or female because they're neither in Christ. &gt;&gt; We're souls. We're actually spirits that have souls. &gt;&gt; And he loves us &gt;&gt; and he wants to make something out of us. &gt;&gt; So, we got to lose. We got to be stripped of our need for applause. &gt;&gt; We've got to let misunderstanding strip away our need for applause. Our need for approval. Our need for vindication. We always are triangulating. Bringing somebody else in to agree with us. Isn't that right, honey? Isn't that right, sweetheart? Isn't that right, son? Isn't that right? Calling by name. Needing someone to nod their head and say, "Yes, that's right." How many of you know it's not anybody else to vindicate us? &gt;&gt; What we need is to know we're on the word. &gt;&gt; And when we know we're on the word, we just stand on the word &gt;&gt; and let the rest roll by us. You ought to amen while you can. &gt;&gt; You don't have to vindicate yourself. You don't have to waste God's time telling everybody how wonderful you are. &gt;&gt; You don't have to put your five-fold ministry title on your card. I'm apostle so and so. I'm prophet so and so. I'm evangelist so and so. Be a son of God. &gt;&gt; Be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "What are you?" Well, I'm a message believer. But before that, you better be a son of God. &gt;&gt; You you you better know who Jesus is. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus is the message. &gt;&gt; The message is bigger than tapes and books. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The message is the total entire unveiling. &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Cover to cover. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Giver to cover. &gt;&gt; That's what &gt;&gt; all of it. And he's unveiling himself to a sincere people. And it's causing them to be misunderstood. Social media is causing them to feel more sensitive about being misunderstood. Some of us have such big complexes until we read a post on Facebook from somebody we hadn't seen in 25 years and we're just sure they're posting about us. &gt;&gt; 25 years since they've seen your mug. They don't they forgotten you exist. &gt;&gt; It's not likely that they're posting about you. &gt;&gt; We're so full of complexes &gt;&gt; because of social media. You don't have to say amen. &gt;&gt; It's scientific fact now. It's brain science now. &gt;&gt; We're going to have to come to a place where we just stand for Jesus. Let the world go by. &gt;&gt; If they love us, praise God. If they hate us, praise God. &gt;&gt; This isn't a popularity contest. This is a race. &gt;&gt; And it's not starting out in the race that's going to give you the prize. It's finishing. And this bride must not only finish, she must finish well. &gt;&gt; She's got to finish well &gt;&gt; with the victory because Jesus is the victor. &gt;&gt; Are you here? &gt;&gt; Good. We're going somewhere, but I don't want to go too fast. We're going somewhere. We don't want to spend all of our time defending ourselves. We don't want to be disturbed by rejection. It's going to come. &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to leave you out of their party. &gt;&gt; Let's see if we can get some help in here. &gt;&gt; Listen, if they didn't invite you to their birthday party, you ought to be thankful that you don't have to spend 25, 35, $45 on a birthday present. &gt;&gt; Go to Longhorn, buy you a steak, tell yourself happy birthday. When we're young and immature, &gt;&gt; we think we have to be included in everything. &gt;&gt; You're going to get left out. &gt;&gt; And like I said, just spend that money down at Longhorn. &gt;&gt; Don't you even let it bother you, disturb you. &gt;&gt; Someone said, "Well, I can't help it. It just hurts my feelings a little bit." Let me tell you something. There's a reason for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't even have to try to figure out what it is. &gt;&gt; Just say, "Thank God." Keep moving on. Keep marching on. &gt;&gt; Don't be worried about rejection. If you're worried about rejection, you'll be like a magnet. &gt;&gt; It'll come flying in your direction. &gt;&gt; You don't need human validation. &gt;&gt; You're not anchored in what people think. And so this is a reason why God's had us in the vessel of misunderstanding &gt;&gt; because he wants us to get some of that stuff worked out of us &gt;&gt; in the vessel of misunderstanding. Your heart has been misread by somebody. &gt;&gt; But let heaven keep the record. &gt;&gt; Let the Holy Ghost keep the record of what's going really really happened. &gt;&gt; Let obedience be your vindication. That's right. &gt;&gt; You don't have to vindicate yourself. They may not see your heart, but God sees your heart. &gt;&gt; They may forget your faithfulness, but God will never forget your faithfulness. He will never disregard your obedience to him. &gt;&gt; When you get out of this vessel of misunderstanding, you'll no longer be driven by an overinflated ego, but you will recognize that without him, we are absolutely nothing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to say a bigger amen than that. &gt;&gt; Circumstances will try to manipulate us &gt;&gt; into stinking thinking. &gt;&gt; Let him pour you. &gt;&gt; Let him pour you. &gt;&gt; And when he pours, you leave all that old stuff behind. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm left out. I'm I'm left out of everything. I'm just left out. Now I want to go to Psalm 27 for just a moment. Verse 5 and 6. For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me. &gt;&gt; This is what you'll have to remember as you're leaving misunderstanding behind. That in the time of trouble, he shall hide me in in his pavilion. Listen, Satan wants you to get worked up about politics. He wants you to ring your hands because social security will be no more and maybe Medicare will be no more and maybe this one thing or that one thing won't be no more. Let me tell you something. In the time of trouble, &gt;&gt; he will hide you in his pavilion. &gt;&gt; You can't change what's going on out there. &gt;&gt; Sure, you can vote your conscience when it's time to vote. Absolutely. But if you get so worked up in what's happening in our nation right now that you're afraid that you're going to lose your investment, you're going to lose your retirement, you're going you're going to have to take your retirement like David took his retirement. I'm an old man. Never seen the righteous forsaken. &gt;&gt; Never seen God's seed begging bread. I don't know how. I don't know when. But I know he will hide me. I know I was not appointed under wrath. &gt;&gt; New Testament. I was not appointed under wrath. There's going to be a way out of here one day. &gt;&gt; Not one minute until God's got everything out of me that's got to get out of me so that I can be what he called me to be &gt;&gt; and go home in a blaze of glory. &gt;&gt; And some of us may not see it. Some of us may go by the way of the grave. But don't worry, you won't have to lay there long. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're in the last of the last days. &gt;&gt; You can mock it. You can make fun of it. People have been doing it since the New Testament times. &gt;&gt; The New Testament says they're scoffing at the at the at the talk of his coming. They're scoffing at it. Scoffers will surely come show us the sign of his coming. But I want you to know we're nearer than we've ever been before. &gt;&gt; The bridegroom is doing something in us. He's getting a people ready. &gt;&gt; And he will hide us in the time of trouble in his pavilion. Let's say the word pavilion. &gt;&gt; In the secret of his, let's say that word together, tabernacle. He shall hide me. He shall set me up &gt;&gt; on. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, you you think we can claim that promise? Is it in the book? &gt;&gt; Is it in the book? Somebody said, "What's the context?" Well, we know the context. We can preach the context. We can teach the context. But the reality is every promise in the book, &gt;&gt; I have the right to attach my faith to it &gt;&gt; and make it my own. &gt;&gt; So, I'm doing that tonight. In the time of trouble, my God shall hide me in his pavilion, in the secret of his tabernacle. He will hide me. He shall set me up. upon a rock. &gt;&gt; Those who misunderstood, &gt;&gt; they'll have to look up on the rock to see where I am. &gt;&gt; Some of those who have tried so hard to dissuade you and discourage you and deflate you will have to look up and see you on the rock. Because when the wind is blowing and life is howling and the earth is shaking beneath our feet, God's going to have a people on the rock, &gt;&gt; stronger than the rock of Gibralar. &gt;&gt; The rock of ages. Somebody say hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now mine head, listen, it goes on. And now mine head be lifted up. And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies, round about me. Therefore will I offer in his &gt;&gt; tabernacle. &gt;&gt; You ought to help me &gt;&gt; sacrif &gt;&gt; when I get in that pavilion. I'm not going to fold my hands and sit like a little church mouse. No, I'm going to praise him with sacrifices of joy. I'm going to sing on the rock &gt;&gt; from the rock. I will sing praises unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now, in a minute, I'm going to have to say some things without explaining them. It's going to be hard for me to do that. It's going to be hard for you for me to do that. When I get to that place, I'll tell you that I'm there. And I want you to listen. And this was the wrestling match that I ended up having to have because it seemed as though it just didn't quite fit where we are in the moment in the series. But it was what the Lord gave me. And he gave me instructions of how to ground it. And I can't move from that. even though it may just simply be declaring it into the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you ever learned that lesson? &gt;&gt; You're always looking for who who's going to get this and who's going to receive this? Who's going to understand that? You know, we're looking in the crowd. All of us, even public speakers, we're trying to find somebody that seems to be relating to what we're saying. But the reality is we're not just preaching to those in this room. when we're under the inspiration. Uh uh all of you who find yourself singing under the inspiration or preaching under the inspiration, this bride has an authority that we don't yet understand. &gt;&gt; And the word of God declared into the atmosphere of your home &gt;&gt; and change it in a moment's notice. &gt;&gt; Not only change what's going on in your home, it can do some changing in the block. That's right. &gt;&gt; The word of God has power and authority. &gt;&gt; If you believe that, say amen. &gt;&gt; So, we have to be faithful in this. Now, I know some of you are offended that anybody else would dare to translate the holy scripture other than King James, those that he uh hired to do the job. But there are some times that we can gain a little deeper understanding by looking at the original word itself. And you don't have to be a scholar to do that anymore &gt;&gt; because there are tools available for you if you love to study the word. &gt;&gt; Paul told Timothy, "Study to show thyself approved unto God a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth." The Bible speaks about the Bereans, doesn't it? those who heard the good promises of God under the new covenant, but they searched the scriptures constantly to see if these things be so. &gt;&gt; They understood that if God's going to do something in our day, it has to have a foundation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Behind us somewhere. &gt;&gt; Because when God says, "I'm going to do a new thing," he means scripturally it's a new season. &gt;&gt; It doesn't always mean I'm going to do something that I've never done before. Sometimes it means that &gt;&gt; it did concerning a virgin &gt;&gt; who was going to conceive a child. I'm going to do something I've never done in the earth before. He did. &gt;&gt; But a lot of the times it's just simply God announcing that you're going to go through a new season in your life where you understand things you didn't understand before. Where you operate in things you never operated in before. Where you let God use you in ways you didn't let him use you before. &gt;&gt; Amen. You understand that? &gt;&gt; Listen, this isn't just for a handful of preachers. &gt;&gt; This thing is a body ministry. &gt;&gt; God wants every one of us on duty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With more than words, &gt;&gt; with life. Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; And now my shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies, round about me. Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will sing. Yay. I will sing praises unto the Lord. The Amplified says it this way. For in the day of trouble, I believe you have it, he will hide me in his shelter in the secret place of his tent. Will he hide me? He will set me high. upon a rock. When is God going to do this? In the day of trouble. &gt;&gt; You believe we're living in the day of trouble. &gt;&gt; You believe God's people are facing battles like they've never I'm telling you, sickness like I've never seen so much sickness in all my life. &gt;&gt; That's what the people of God are experiencing in this hour. And somebody said, "I don't think it's it's abnormal." Yes, I think it's abnormal. I think it's multiplied. I think we're seeing it in ways we have never seen it before. &gt;&gt; We know some people in this room know what it is to experience a place in God where sickness stays at bay. &gt;&gt; There is a divine health. &gt;&gt; The enemy hates it. &gt;&gt; And we don't walk in it because we don't talk it. &gt;&gt; Here it is. now. But in the day of trouble, he's got a place for me. &gt;&gt; There's some other translations. I'm not giving you the names. I'm just reading to you the slight variation. Another one said, "He hideth me in a secret place of his tent." The complete Jewish Bible. I have a little friendship that goes along with that one because I knew Dr. David Stern and his wife Martha who lived in Jerusalem. He very carefully very very carefully put these things together from the original language and he said for he will conceal me in his shelter on the day of trouble. Listen to this phrase. He will hide me in the folds of his tent. He will set me high on a rock. Another translator said, "He hides me away under his roof." King James said, "Pavilion on the day of evil. One translator said, "He will raise me beyond reach &gt;&gt; of distress. &gt;&gt; There is a hiding place. &gt;&gt; It's the rock of ages. &gt;&gt; It's the living word." &gt;&gt; One translator said, "He sets me high on a mountaintop so that I can look down and see the distress of nations. But I have a song to sing because he has made a way for me. &gt;&gt; Put up the word pavilion. Will you do that just a moment? Uh, some of you are going to have to see if you can get this reading between the lines just a little bit this evening. This is a Hebrew word. My mouth is dry because I'm nervous. Uh, but I'll just take a little water if you don't mind. This word that is translated in English pavilion is Hebrew 55:20 and the word is suk. It's a masculine noun meaning a cover, a covert, a hiding place, a tent, a booth, a hut, a refuge, a thicket, a leafy canopy, an entwined boughs of trees. Sometimes the poets talk about a canopy of leaves intertwining boughs of trees that become Wesley John Wesley makes a statement about the intertwining of the branches of the trees creating a sanctuary in God's creation for his people. not satisfied in the hustle and bustle, but finding their peace in in nature, in creation, &gt;&gt; just getting underneath what looks like an avenue of trees. This is one of the words, one of the meanings of the word pavilion. It can be used to describe the shelter of the large leaves of the fig tree. And we were singing about a lion inside of our lungs. He has a name. &gt;&gt; He has a name. &gt;&gt; You've got a lion inside of you. &gt;&gt; He has a name. &gt;&gt; He is the lion of the tribe of Yehuda, Judah. &gt;&gt; This time I will praise the Lord. If the lion of the tribe of Judah, his life is in you. You're going to be a praiser. &gt;&gt; You just can't help but worship him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, this is a word pavilion is also at its very root. It can mean the protection of the den or the lair of the lion. Oh, hallelujah. Hide me in the in the cave of the lion. In the lair of the lion, in the den of the lion, let me be hidden underneath a canopy of trees. Let me find my tabernacle, my my shade. Didn't he say that on Zion, he would be the pavilion? He would be uh the protection from the heat of the sun, from the troubles of this life. It's not that you and I won't no trouble. It's that we will be hidden in that pavilion, in that tabernacle, underneath the folds of that tent, so that what's happening around us will not send us into a panic. &gt;&gt; You won't have to run out of your pills when you find a rest. &gt;&gt; It won't matter how the wind blows or the devil howls, you'll know I've got a hiding place. I've got a resting place. It doesn't mean you won't face some trials and troubles. You may get sick like somebody down the street gets sick, but you won't be hopeless &gt;&gt; because you'll be hidden. I am hidden. &gt;&gt; Somebody ought to just go ahead and prophesy it. I am hidden. I am hidden in the pavilion of the Lord, in the refuge of the Lord, in the tabernacle of the Lord, beneath the folds of the tent. I'm behind the veil. Read between the lines, church. Will you do it? &gt;&gt; For for he hides me away under his roof. &gt;&gt; He goes on to say, uh, this this uh is a place, it describes a place where a person can be undetected. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh, wouldn't you long to be off the devil's radar for just 30 minutes? Did you know you're known in two realms, two dimensions? &gt;&gt; Did you know heaven knows you by name? &gt;&gt; Did you know hell knows you by name? &gt;&gt; You're known in both worlds. &gt;&gt; You're known in both dimensions. And yet the promise of God's word is, I want to hide my people in a place where they are undetected &gt;&gt; by the one who has come to destroy. Now, what have you got to do to get in that place? You've got to go through the vessel &gt;&gt; of misunderstanding. &gt;&gt; You've got to drink the dregs &gt;&gt; of rejection. &gt;&gt; I can't help it if you sleep. &gt;&gt; I got to preach anyway. &gt;&gt; You're going to go through that place of being scrutinized. everything you do criticized, &gt;&gt; misunderstood. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "I don't like it." I don't know anybody that does like it. &gt;&gt; But if on the other side of that I can hide in the folds of his tent, if I can find my shelter in his tabernacle. &gt;&gt; If he'll give me a pavilion where I am undetected from the enemy. &gt;&gt; I'm just reading the book. &gt;&gt; I'm just reading the book. Describes a place where a person can be undetected. It refers to the protective shielding, the hiding place of God's tent. &gt;&gt; I didn't write this. It' come right out of the lexicon. The tabernacle, the presence. This presence is not a feeling. &gt;&gt; It's talking about a heavy glory. &gt;&gt; It's cavode. Cabod. &gt;&gt; It's a heavy glory. It's what the old-timers used to call &gt;&gt; shakina. She &gt;&gt; it's a heavyw weighted glory of God. And when that heavy glory comes down, you may not be able to scream. &gt;&gt; You may not be able to dance. &gt;&gt; You may just only be able to open your mouth and say, "Oh, &gt;&gt; I stand in awe &gt;&gt; of the beauty of my God. &gt;&gt; Is he beautiful?" &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question. Is Jesus beautiful? &gt;&gt; Is the Messiah beautiful? &gt;&gt; Is he beautiful to look on now? &gt;&gt; There was a time he wasn't beautiful to look on. No one desired to see him. Isaiah prophesied no comeliness was found in him. He was misfigured. &gt;&gt; He was misshapen by in by sin, by iniquity so that no one desired to look on him. And the reality is his little bride that's transitioning in this hour from bride to wife. All we want to do is look at him &gt;&gt; because to us he's beautiful. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Here is his beauty. &gt;&gt; It's unveiled. It's revealed. He is standing now out in front of the lattice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's near enough to smell his presence. Somebody said, "Well, didn't brother Brandham say something about those people who are always claiming to smell." I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about what the Song of Solomon says. The Song of Songs. Who is this &gt;&gt; that I see coming up out of the wilderness? &gt;&gt; What's the rest? &gt;&gt; Leaning. leaning. Come on, lean. &gt;&gt; Leaning on her beloved. &gt;&gt; It goes on to tell us she smells &gt;&gt; like he smells &gt;&gt; because she's been leaning on him. You lean on him, brother sister. Lean on him, brother sister. And you'll come out smelling like him. &gt;&gt; You really going to be that quiet? You want me to tell you what you smell like? &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; You want somebody to tell you what you smell like? I'm not talk Listen, folks. I'm not talking about Bo. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about smelling like Jesus. &gt;&gt; Because you've been with him &gt;&gt; because you know him. &gt;&gt; Because you've been in the tent. under the pavilion, &gt;&gt; under the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Oh, we like to call our churches around this movement. We like to call our churches the tabernacle of this and the tabernacle of that and the tabernacle of the other. Let's make sure that that doesn't become names of blasphemy &gt;&gt; like some of the rest of the names that people hang on their church door. If you're going to advertise that you you're a part of the Word of Deliverance tabernacle, there ought to be a word of deliverance moving somewhere under that pavilion. &gt;&gt; We ought to have to bring forth the tokens. &gt;&gt; Praise his name. I'm trying to stay calm. and keep my whistle wet at the same time. It indicates the place. Let's put that back up. It indicates the place where God dwells. That used to be the Mishan, the tabernacle in the wilderness, the tabernacle of Moses. Then it became the tabernacle of David. Between those tabernacles, it became a temple. Kept getting destroyed. God kept sending somebody to raise it up again. &gt;&gt; Every bit of it a type. Every bit of it a shadow. every bit of it. An arrow pointing to another house, &gt;&gt; to another tabernacle, to another tent, to another veil. &gt;&gt; Are you reading between the line? &gt;&gt; What house will you build me? &gt;&gt; He's not looking for a a a badger skin tent anymore. He's not looking for a sanctuary of the cedars of Lebanon anymore. He's looking for a temple, a tabernacle, a shelter of flesh. &gt;&gt; He's looking for a body. [Music] &gt;&gt; Acts, read it. Read Stephen's sermon. &gt;&gt; Read what he was preaching before they stoned him to death. He was telling them God was pleased to dwell in this and pleased to dwell in that and pleased to dwell in the other. And then he came in a body of flesh and you crucified him. &gt;&gt; And if he shows up in flesh again, &gt;&gt; they'll do the same to him &gt;&gt; to them. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What do you mean if God shows up in flesh again?" Well, that's what he was doing on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He was pouring a little of who he was, &gt;&gt; a little of his deity, a little of his authority, a little of his power. &gt;&gt; You shall receive power. &gt;&gt; Not under a false baptism. &gt;&gt; Not under a false baptism of titles. &gt;&gt; He didn't say, "I've given you a title where you might come and be saved." He said, "I've given you a name &gt;&gt; that is above every name &gt;&gt; that at the name of Jesus." &gt;&gt; It's Acts 2:38, isn't it? &gt;&gt; Baptize in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the church couldn't live with that. Too many pagans coming into that Roman church and they had to put God in pieces and give him titles. I wouldn't put my hope in a title. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't put my hope in a president. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't put my hope in a mayor. &gt;&gt; Anybody listening? Get off your phones. &gt;&gt; You didn't come here to be on the phone. &gt;&gt; You came here to hear something from God. You got ears to hear. You'll be able to do that. Stay off the phone. &gt;&gt; It's making us idiots. &gt;&gt; It's rewiring our brains. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Just go tell a doctor. He'll give you a pill. He'll fix you. &gt;&gt; Anybody that goes in and says, "I don't have any attention span." They put a slap a diagnosis on them and send them out the door. &gt;&gt; It's nothing in the world. But we have programmed our brain to scroll. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; If it don't interest me, I'll just keep scrolling. &gt;&gt; And some of us come to church, we got our thumb, and we're just ready. If that don't interest me, I'll just scroll up. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I'm not mad. &gt;&gt; I'm actually happy. Praise God. &gt;&gt; I've been in his tabernacle. &gt;&gt; But that's where we are. And that little bride's not going to be able to be that way and make it all the way through. No, it indicates a place where God dwells. Put it back one more time. Ancients have referred to it as King James said pavilion. I'm getting all that meaning out of the one word that was translated pavilion. The ancients have referred to it as the tent. That is that is uh Melik Haham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; King of the whole universe. &gt;&gt; It's Melik Hamelik. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; King of the kings. &gt;&gt; Lord of the lords. &gt;&gt; And he's got a place to hide you. &gt;&gt; Is he your hiding place? &gt;&gt; I want you to look at Psalm 76 for just a minute. The reason for the misunderstanding, and I'll close in a little while, the reason for the misunderstanding is to get you ready for the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; It's to get you ready for the tent. &gt;&gt; It's to get you ready for the pavilion. is to get you ready for the hiding place &gt;&gt; where he can set you up on a rock and let you sing the high songs of Zion &gt;&gt; no matter what's going on around you. &gt;&gt; Look, I saw a taste of that when I was a child. &gt;&gt; I did. &gt;&gt; I saw a people that didn't have the whole word, but they had enough of God. They worked so hard they worked their fingers to the bone in the cotton mills, &gt;&gt; in the hosery mills, in the denim mills of this area. This was a mill not just valley, not just Lraange Columbus. We had we we were making the denim too and and the and the sheeting and the bedding and long before there were automatic automatic computerized looms &gt;&gt; when they still sent an oldfashioned shuttle where those shuttles would fly out of those looms sometime, knock somebody upside the head and have to send them to the cuz they fell cold on the ground. Dangerous work. People would sometimes get caught up in those things. Serious times, poor times. I went to church with people on Tuesday night that came in smelling like the cotton meal. I went to church with sisters who came to church and in their long hair was was fuzzies of cotton &gt;&gt; that had flown through that mill and they didn't have time to they could either go home and cook for their families and come to church or they could go home and wash their hair and clean and put on clean clothes and be ready. They couldn't do both. So they had a duty to work all day and then go home and and cook a meal and provide for their husbands and children and then bring the ones that would come with them to the house of God. And they would come in the door so physically tired that they could hardly get out of the car. But the presence of God would meet them. &gt;&gt; These people didn't seem to have a care in the world. They gathered around the old hightop piano and sung the songs of Zion until they shouted their eyelasses off and their bobby pins off. &gt;&gt; They looked like they were in a trance at times. Their eyes would glaze over like glass, not because they were in some kind of ecstatic existence, but because they had got their vision fixed. They were looking beyond their life. They were looking beyond their heartache. &gt;&gt; They weren't seeing the sorrow. &gt;&gt; They weren't seeing the cotton meal. &gt;&gt; They were seeing eternity. &gt;&gt; Oh, Sister Cotney was one of them. Brother Shaw, she worked until the day she died. never missed a shout, never missed a service, never missed an opportunity to give. And she didn't have the word we have today, but what she had, she believed it with every fiber of her being. And God somehow was giving her a little taste, a little glimpse of of the power of an age to come. She got under that pavilion and no matter what was going on, she could have she could have told you a sobb story that would have made you cry and boohoo and moan and groan, but she chose rather to use her testimony to glorify the God of heaven that had saved her out of sin that had moved her out of the dance hall. She'd jump up and say, "Praise God, when I got saved, I didn't quit dancing. I used to dance in every dance hall in Muscogee County. But when I got saved, I didn't quit dancing. I just changed partners. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; She didn't know what algebra was. &gt;&gt; She didn't know what geometry was, but she knew what it was to find the bubble, &gt;&gt; that glory covering. &gt;&gt; She went to work in it. &gt;&gt; Listen, they had testimonies. The power of God would fall sometime o on a on a lunch break &gt;&gt; and people would receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and superintendent would come down out of their lofty offices to see what was going on and and underlords would say to the supervis the big big wigs aren't what you going to do about it what you going to do about it aren't you going to put a stop to that they said to one I knew him well they said to one Methodist they said aren't you going to put a stop to them tongue talkers, them holy rollers, having a prayer meeting, getting all excited on the lunch break, turning this place upside down. You're a Methodist. What you going to do about it? He said, I'm going to get out of the way. &gt;&gt; What you going to do if it goes on beyond beyond the lunch break? He said, we'll face that when we get to it. But he said, here's what I've noticed. When they come out of that prayer meeting at the end of the aisle there, when they come out of that prayer meeting, he said they go to work with a new passion, with a new enthusiasm. &gt;&gt; They're either humming a humming a hymn or singing a song. &gt;&gt; And we're getting more out of them than we are them that's been drunk all night &gt;&gt; and come in here with a hangover. Come on, folks. &gt;&gt; People had it hard, but they found the place. You've got more than they had. &gt;&gt; You've got more than they had economically. We've got more than they had spiritually. We've got more than they had wordbased. &gt;&gt; More revelation than they had in that day. &gt;&gt; Come on. And somebody will come in here. Well, I could praise the Lord if it wasn't for him. I could praise the Lord if it wasn't for her. There's a pavilion. &gt;&gt; There's a tabern. I got to hurry. There's a tabernacle. Listen to this. Psalm 76 in Salem. Hallelujah. I have two homes. I have a home in Salem, Alabama. Salem, just up the hill. And I have a home in Jerusalem. an apartment in Jerusalem because of you folks. And and this word Saleem or Salem here is is a word that's used to describe Jerusalem in Jerusalem, which for us is a spiritual place. It's Zion spiritual, not just Zion geographical, but it's we're a Zion people. Yes, we are. &gt;&gt; You see, overcomers are going to sit with him in his throne, even as he has sat down with his father in his throne. That's the overcomer's throne. And that's Zion. &gt;&gt; And it's not a cube, is it? &gt;&gt; 1500 miles. Yes. In every direction, including up. There's a revelation that goes with that. We got to hurry. In Salem also is his tabernacle and his dwelling place in Zion. There break he the arrows of the bow, the shield and the sword and the battle. And what's that last word? Sila. Sellah, it means pause and think on these things. Now, when we put a ceil there at the end, it means there's more to this than you get with a casual readover. &gt;&gt; The psalmist is saying to us, I'm going to build, God is going to build for his people a tabernacle. It's not a geographical place that you've got to get to. It's a spiritual position that you arrive in &gt;&gt; where you understand the authority of a Zion company of people, an overcoming bride, &gt;&gt; and you do something about it. You're not always responding to what the devil does. &gt;&gt; You're just letting his errors go. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You're responding to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. read between the lines. &gt;&gt; I don't say that. That's not my phrase. I rarely ever say that. So don't think that's something I pull out all the time. What I mean is there's something here for those who can have the cila in Judaism. this Psalm 27 that we read in the beginning. For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me. In Judaism, the psalm Psalm 27 is read every day for 30 days leading up to the feast of trumpets. And it is known in Judaism as the wedding of the Messiah, the tabernacle. the tent, the pavilion. It's known this place of rest for the bride, a position in the word, &gt;&gt; a place in Christ, in his side. It's known as the wedding of the Messiah. It's in Christ where the bride becomes wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's in the word &gt;&gt; where the bride becomes wife. &gt;&gt; It's one thing to be engaged to Christ. &gt;&gt; It's another thing to be his wife. &gt;&gt; Isn't that right? &gt;&gt; A lot of church people have flings, one night stands with the bridegroom. He's not looking for a for just a lover. &gt;&gt; He's looking for a wife. &gt;&gt; Anybody here? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in the one of the very last sermons of his ministry in a little town now a little larger now than called Yuma, Arizona. Anybody ever been there? I've been to Yuma. almost on the Mexican border. They're having a banquet. Brother Brandham is speaking at the banquet. Brother Perry Green is there and many other names that you would know. There was confusion in the room. There was a woman standing in the back of the room, propped in the doorway, smoking a cigarette. She was the director of the kitchen staff. The waitresses and waiters kept coming in to clear the tables because Brother Brandon was speaking so long. They thought that they would cause enough disruption that he would just stop. But somehow he kept preaching. The sermon was called the rapture. &gt;&gt; Anybody familiar with it? The sermon was called the rapture. Brother Brandham mentions the fact that he's distracted. They're moving around. There's a lot of problem, lot lot of rushing. They wanted him out. They wanted the people out even though it had been well paid for. Brother Green told me himself, he said, "I went and offered them whatever they would ask." He said, "I don't care what you ask. I will pay you whatever you ask if you will leave him alone. We want to hear what he has to say. And we I'll give you a check double what we've paid to rent this room for the evening. If you'll walk away and give us more time if you'll just leave us alone. I'll make sure. He said, "Here's I've got it. I'll write the check. Whatever I need to do." And finally, he found a little more liberty. And yet, it's one of the sermons that he asked not to be released. And we have it now. It was released right after his death. Why are you mentioning that tonight? I'm mentioning it because when we speak about rapture, we usually quote from Thessalonians or Corinthians. The dead in Christ shall rise first. We which are alive and remain shall be caught up to meet the Lord in the air with them to meet the Lord in the air. Or we read from Corinthians, corruption, putting on incorruption, the dead and Christ changing, don't we? You you you're familiar. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we might use Revelation 4:1. Give me another minute. &gt;&gt; We've got breakfast for you. Won't cost you a penny. It's not even dark outside yet. &gt;&gt; Give me another minute. I don't have the money brother Green had evidently. I'd just write you a check and tell you how much will it cost you to sit there and help me a little more a little while longer. Some of you wouldn't get a penny because you haven't helped me at all anyway. But some of you have and I appreciate it greatly. But today I have to pay for an amen. I'm I'm just going to retire. You would think it would be Corinthians or or Thessalonians if a man's going to teach on the rapture. Maybe even Revelation 4 one where where the voice says to John, "Come up here. Come up higher." There's things I want to show you. There's a door open and I want to show you some things. Sometimes they use Enoch who walked with God and was not because God took him. &gt;&gt; What you need to understand about Enoch was he was not before he was not. &gt;&gt; Because that phrase was not doesn't just mean he left the earth. It also means he was emptied of himself. &gt;&gt; So Enoch had to empty himself out &gt;&gt; before he could be a was not &gt;&gt; and leave the earth. &gt;&gt; He just he just come on. Sometimes we might talk about uh Elijah who left here in a chariot pulled by horses of fire. &gt;&gt; But when brother Brandham was giving his text for the rapture message, he didn't use Corinthians. He didn't use Thessalonians. He didn't use Revelation 4. He didn't use Enoch. He didn't use Elite. He used Psalm 27. For in the time of trouble, he shall hide me in his pavilion. In the secret of his tabernacle, he shall hide me. He shall set me upon a rock. And now shall mine head be lifted up above my enemies round about me. Therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy. I will sing. Yeah, I will sing praises unto the Lord. This was the text that he felt the inspiration to use for a message that he was going to preach and teach on rapture. So, there's something about this pavilion. There's something about this tabernacle. There's something about this shelter, this covert, this refuge. There's something about this rock. There's something about this hiding place. &gt;&gt; Amen. That speaks of of rapture. &gt;&gt; It speaks of translation. &gt;&gt; It speaks of a change. &gt;&gt; It speaks of a difference that the word makes. &gt;&gt; It speaks about something that takes place in privacy, &gt;&gt; not in the public view, &gt;&gt; not a public show. The door is closed. &gt;&gt; Enter into thy closet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or chamber. &gt;&gt; Close the door. &gt;&gt; That's where I'm going to talk to you. That's where you're going to find your refuge. &gt;&gt; That's where the change is going to take place. &gt;&gt; That's where you'll go in one way and come out another. Did you hear that? You'll go in one way and come out another way. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt hide me. Psalm 31:20. Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man. &gt;&gt; Thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion. Oh, little bride, you're misunderstood now. &gt;&gt; But God's got a change coming for you. &gt;&gt; He's going to hide you from the tongues. &gt;&gt; The strife of tongues, the sting of rejection, the bitter dregs of offense. The word is going to have a body to live in again. &gt;&gt; All that he was, all that Jehovah was, all that Yahweh was, &gt;&gt; he poured into a body of flesh, &gt;&gt; a house of flesh, a body thou hast prepared me. &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ was the fullness No, that doesn't make &gt;&gt; tuness any more than it makes. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus told them, I'm not sending a substitute. &gt;&gt; He said, I will come to you. &gt;&gt; They may have been looking for him to come in in a physical body. He came, but he didn't come in the body he had used before. He came like pillar like tongues of fire. He came like a rushing wind and he filled all of them who were sitting in that upper chamber. &gt;&gt; And the devil is about to have a nervous breakdown because he thought my I have finally won. I have defeated one Jesus. I have put him out of his misery. I've hung him there. I've I've laid him there in a grave never to be heard from again. Then he gets up from the grave. He resurrects from the grave and the enemy doesn't know what to do about him. Now, at the upper room, &gt;&gt; there's not just one Jesus coming out the door. There's at least 120. &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Is that blasphemy?" Not at all. This same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead shall dwell in you. &gt;&gt; It shall also quicken your mortal body. Who is this living inside of you? &gt;&gt; I will not leave you comfortless. &gt;&gt; I will come to you. No wonder they wanted to make him a third person because they couldn't deal with the reality that what was in him was now in them. &gt;&gt; Now he was that word in fullness. You are that word in measure. But the measure of that word that is in you is fullness to you. What do you What do you mean by that? I mean he is complete in you, but you aren't all of him. &gt;&gt; Cuz I've got him, too. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; If you go out there and get you a spoonful of the ocean, you don't have all the ocean, &gt;&gt; but you've got everything the ocean has. That drop, that spoonful is a representation of every mineral. And whatever is in that water, that's a representation of it. And that's what we have. Not just a thimble full. But now to listen, when you get saved, the spirit of Christ, that Holy Spirit certainly comes in and regenerates your life. No doubt about it. We're not talking about that. We're talking about an upper room experience. We're talking about a baptism of the Holy Ghost. And somebody say fire. &gt;&gt; Fire. &gt;&gt; Whoa. Who said that? Was that you? Mercy. Fire. Say it again. Mercy. Fire. Say it. Say it again. Fire. The Holy Ghost. And &gt;&gt; we're closing. I'm going to come to this place now. I think I've already been there where you'll just have to see what you can do with this in a message questions and answers on the seals. I've this whole series I've been preaching I've hardly made quotations. I didn't want to make quotations tonight but I don't have a choice. I have to make a few quotations because it was part of my instructions. Can I give you one more verse? Song of Songs 14. Draw me Draw me, we will run after thee. This is the bride talking. Draw me, we will run after thee. The king hath brought me into his chambers. There it is. Pavilion, tabernacle, &gt;&gt; tent, shelter, refuge, &gt;&gt; hiding place. &gt;&gt; We will be glad and rejoice in thee. We will remember thy love more than wine. &gt;&gt; The upright love thee. Any upright in this room? &gt;&gt; Don't you love him? &gt;&gt; That word chambers there is a masculine noun referring to a parlor, a room, an inner room, a room of lying down, a sleeping room, an innermost part to close in on every side to surround. The word means a compartment or a room within a building. A room within a room. What is the Holy of Holies? &gt;&gt; A room within a room. I will meet you there. What is that? A room within a room. This is not a chamber just where you where you where you built the cow. This is a chamber where there is relationship engaged becoming wife married in the message questions and answers on the seals. I'm just going to have to just cut it off and finish tomorrow. And finally, one day he said, "John the Baptist." All this time, John the Baptist. I've been with some of you in the cave of John the Baptist in Anaram, a place that was discovered less than 30 years ago. A place where it's believed John the Baptist met with believers when he was being threatened before he was arrested and beheaded. We have visited many times the village of Anaram where the Bible tells us John the Baptist was born. He was a voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare ye the way of the Lord. He came a spirit and power of Elijah &gt;&gt; to introduce planet earth to the first coming. of Messiah the word in flesh. It's powerful ministry he had. He wore camel skin and he didn't have an apostolic hairo. The apostolic uh preach so hard against the beards. Our movement does too. Well, I want you to know that there was nothing Greek about John the Baptist or the Messiah. They were rugged men. His hair was in his eyes. No, no uh brillow cream to slick it back. His beard was tangled in his in his uh locust wings and honey. No wonder they thought he was crazy. He didn't wear a robe of a of a cleric, of a of a sage. He he wore a a a loin cloth made out of camel hair. He had one message. Prepare the way of the Lord. He's coming. &gt;&gt; Prepare the way of the Lord. He's coming. Prepare the way of the Lord. He's coming. Prepare the way of the Lord. He's coming. And one day, guess what? He's standing kneedeep in the Jordan River. And his cousin comes walking down the trail to the water &gt;&gt; and comes waiting out in the water. And what does he scream? By revelation. by instantaneous revelation that drops down in his heart. He's always known him as his cousin. He's always known him as the son of his mother's sister. &gt;&gt; He knew him very, very well. But as he came down that hill, uh eyes, his eyes were open. Isab was applied. They come popping open. And he no longer saw his cousin, his aunt's son. He now screamed, "Behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world." That was enough to have him killed on the spot. But he couldn't contain himself. &gt;&gt; He did what he came to do. Come on. &gt;&gt; All those years of preparation in the wilderness, hiding in the cave, all the things he had to go through to just to get to that one moment. Behold the lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world. How can I baptize you? I must needs that you would baptize me. Here he comes. Fan is in his hand. Come on. You know the story. Brother Random says here finally one day he said, "Behold, there he is. There is a lamb of God. takes away the sin of the world. Said, "And my time is up now. My time is up now. I've introduced you to him." Maybe those words aren't recorded in the Gospels, but we know that it wasn't long after that his head was chopped off and served on a platter because he preached against double marriage adultery. He said, "It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother Philip's wife." And they looked for an opportunity to cut his head off. And that he got it, didn't he? I've introduced you to him. I've done what I've come to do. He'll Watch, watch, watch, watch. I must go. Read it for me. &gt;&gt; I must decrease now. I must go off the scene. Here's something powerful. He'll take over from here. powerful. Elijah said, "If you see me leaving, you'll get a double portion. Musicians, would you please come? If you see me when I leave, you'll get a double portion." And then what does Elijah going to do? He turns to Elisha one day and he says, "I'm going up here. Stay here." &gt;&gt; Isn't that strange? He's just told him, "If you see me when I leave, you can have a double portion." And now he says, "I'm going to go up here and do such and such. You stay here. I'll be right back." Elisha says, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. My mama didn't raise no fool. You said if I saw you leave, how do I know if you get up there doing such and such that you won't leave from there? &gt;&gt; Wherever you go, I'm going with you because when you leave, &gt;&gt; I'm not going to get carried away with the sons of the prophets and just act like the rest of them. He when when I if I get to see I'm going to see you leave &gt;&gt; and then I'm going to have that double portion. &gt;&gt; He followed him around, didn't he? On the day that it was time for Elijah to decrease, his time was up. The Lord comes to get him in a chariot and horses drawn like fire, horses of fire drawing a carriage. Elijah just gets in and starts going off. Somebody said, "I don't really believe that. It's figurative. Don't you think?" I don't think it is. You don't mean to tell me that in 2025 you really believe that a chariot from God came down with horses of fire and picked up the pro. Oh yes, &gt;&gt; anybody else's &gt;&gt; crazy as I am. &gt;&gt; I believe it. I believe it. I believe it. I believe it. I tell you what else I believe. I don't believe it was a vision. I believe it was real because his mantle &gt;&gt; came floating down from the sky. &gt;&gt; Elisha said, "That's it. &gt;&gt; That's it." &gt;&gt; The scripture said he went over and got that mantle. He wrapped it around his arm like he'd seen the prophet do. He struck the water like he saw that prophet do. And guess what? God did the same for Elisha [Applause] &gt;&gt; that he had done for Elijah. &gt;&gt; Where is the Lord God of Elijah? Here he is. &gt;&gt; He's in a bride. &gt;&gt; He's in a bride. Anybody here? &gt;&gt; I'm going to read one more thing. I have to being led of the Holy Spirit. Minneapolis, Minnesota. I'm skipping. And watch, he's always scriptural. He said, ' Don't did Did not our Lord say when the when thou prayest, be not like the hypocrite that that likes to take a show, make a show, said, "Enter into the secret closet." And when you're done, so when you've done to close the door, then pray to your father what seeth in secret. And he that seeth in secret, he's paraphrasing, &gt;&gt; shall reward thee openly, it's Matthew 6 3-6, if you want to look at it when you get home, and he said, "You remember that name that you were hunting, that time that you dreamed about?" And I said, "Yes." He said, "I'll meet you in there. that name that you dreamed about that that thing that you remembered it you were you were looking to try to find it again after you dreamed that word let's say I'll meet you in there and this time it won't be a public show &gt;&gt; it's It's a pavilion. It's a tabernacle. It's the folds of a tent. It's in secret. It's a refuge. It's a hiding place. It's a holy of holies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a room within a room. &gt;&gt; I'll meet you in there. And this time it won't be a public show. Now watch what what his understanding of this vision was at the time. He said, "Now we got the tent in making. We're having a tent made." He said, "And then in there I'll be able to carry a prayer line right on through." Now you remember I speak this before it comes to pass. The exceedingly abundantly is fixing to take place. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Sounds like a double portion. It sounds like if a people can recognize when he leaves, if they can recognize his decrees, so that Jesus Hey, [Applause] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist said, "I must decrease &gt;&gt; that he might increase. &gt;&gt; I only came to introduce you to him. I came to show you who he is." Behold, &gt;&gt; the lamb of God. History tells us they tried to make a cult following John the Baptist like some have tried to do in our day like some have done in our day &gt;&gt; because they couldn't see the decrease. You've got to be able to see both. You've got to be able to see the decrease of the of the messenger and you've got to be able to see the increase of the message. And you can't do that if you hang on a quart or two that you pull out of a church age book written by Lee Vale. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where we are told that the message and the messenger are one. But we understand that the message is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the messenger is the voice of one crying in the wilderness. the friend of the bridegroom, &gt;&gt; the one who introduces us. Come on. &gt;&gt; So if there is a people who can see the messenger decreasing while the while the message which is the revelation of Jesus Christ, you see that increasing &gt;&gt; then to those people they're going to find a hiding place in the day of trouble, in the time of distress, in the hour of peril and and horror and heartache. I'm going to hide them somewhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not in a physical geographical location, &gt;&gt; in a spiritual position. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A song in their mouth. Praise God. No matter what's going on around them, the change has come. &gt;&gt; Like every other change, &gt;&gt; the real change is always inside out, &gt;&gt; not outside in. I'm closing. You've already said that. Yeah. The tense in the making and then and there I'll be able to carry the the exceedingly abundant and these things here that you see now will be amateur to what our Lord is fixing to do. &gt;&gt; You just remember with all your heart and live for him now and be reverent. &gt;&gt; Sounds like good advice, &gt;&gt; doesn't it? &gt;&gt; Just be yourself. Just be Mrs. Door. for Mr. Doe and love the Lord and just move on with a true heart before him and love him. He will take care of the rest of it. 1956. Let's stand. And just for those of you who will not be here tomorrow, 65 711. But now speaking on what the service is and going to Africa and the things that we we've tried to arrange for these few days here in Indiana somehow or another. Lord, it may be you are driving us to that tent to make that vision fulfilled. July the 11th, 65. It's still Say it again. Brother Eddie Miller was 14 years old on that day. Interesting. 63. It's almost here exceeding abundantly. It's 1965, July 11. It may be you're driving us to that tent to make that vision fulfilled. So, thy will be done. We've committed it this way the best of our understanding. So, we pray Lord, is there anything too contrary to your will? You'll if there is if there is anything contrary to your will, you'll make it known to us that we might know to do your perfect will. &gt;&gt; Three years later, still waiting, still waiting on the fulfillment of a vision, of a tent, of a room within a room, a prayer line. One go they go in one way, one go another. I have dozens of places where he said, "Maybe we'll try that the next time we're here. Maybe maybe we'll put that tent right up here in Jeffersonville. Maybe we'll do such and such. We've got the tent in the making. The money is already in place to buy that tent. You you break that vision into three phases and you understand that if the first two phases of that were spiritual in nature, they had a spiritual understanding, a spiritual interpretation. Why would we come to think that the last part has a natural interpretation? And why is it that after all these years there would be anybody on the planet still looking for a physical tent? &gt;&gt; Come on. When we know by the word of God, it's more than a physical piece of canvas. &gt;&gt; It's a place to hide in Christ. &gt;&gt; It's a spiritual position where we get up above our problems and our troubles and our trials and we see Jesus everywhere we look. We see him because he's with us. Even in us, his life is bringing the change. &gt;&gt; And when those around us are in desperate uh broken horror because life is bashing them against the rocks. This little bride just reaches out to kiss the rock &gt;&gt; because she has a revelation that he's the rock I'm hiding on. He's the rock I'm singing on. He's the rock I'm sitting on. Let me tell you, no matter what comes your way for the rest of your duration here on planet Earth, there's a hiding place for you, there's a position in the word for you. There's a manifestation of the life of Christ in you if you'll yield yourself to the truth. Quit trying to make things appear in physical form when God is changing us always from the inside out. Change us, Lord. Change us tonight. May we be changed, Lord. May we catch a glimpse that this word is line upon line and precept upon precept. Lord Jesus, help us to see that you're talking about your little bride, your the little bodies, that many membered body of Christ. The change taking place is a is a a a change from head knowledge &gt;&gt; to heart knowledge. Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Where we don't have to think it up, we live it out. &gt;&gt; Play something. Into thy chamber. Into thy chamber. Be free. Holy Spirit, speak to me gently as I close the door. Heavenly lover, let thy presence cover. Shikina unending is all I long for. Let's come and worship the Lord before we leave today. Give me the words. Into thy chamber be free. Holy Spirit, speak to me gently as I close the door. Oh heavenly lover, let thy presence cover shakina unending is all I long for. Give me a verse. Father, I worship you out of my spirit, blessing and thanking you in my own way. your heart. I covet, Lord, your will and your purpose. He needs you to tell him that tonight. &gt;&gt; Into submission. &gt;&gt; I surrender. &gt;&gt; Oh, into thy chamber. Be free. Tell him &gt;&gt; I give you permission &gt;&gt; to be free. &gt;&gt; No more restriction. [Music] Heavenly lover. [Music] &gt;&gt; Listen to this verse. Come my beloved Be my Lord and Master as I yield myself. Unite me to thee. [Music] Let thy holy word wrap around me. This day I plead my defense, protection, and my covering. &gt;&gt; Do you hear the language? Covering me. Sorry about that. And [Music] &gt;&gt; I want to hear you speak to me, Lord. Oh, this misunderstanding has got to be about something. &gt;&gt; There's got to be something on the other side of this scrutiny. &gt;&gt; Let your word wrap around me. &gt;&gt; Unite me to thee. Now on my journey, the wine press falls heavy, but it's bringing forth only the best of the while. So I pressed toward the mark for the prize of I calling to be a part of that beautiful lady the bride. Sing it from your heart into [Music] &gt;&gt; be free. Speak to me gently &gt;&gt; and I'll close the door. &gt;&gt; I'll shut the world out. &gt;&gt; I'll shut the internet out. I'll shut I have to out &gt;&gt; so that I can be changed. &gt;&gt; I can find my hiding place. Come and sing that. &gt;&gt; Keep worshiping and singing that chorus for a moment. Into &gt;&gt; thy chamber be free. Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; speak to me gently as I close the door. Heavenly lover let thy presence cover the building is all I long for. into thy chamber. Be free. Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; speak to me gently as I close the door. Heavenly love the earth let thy presence cover [Music] unending is all I [Music] journey &gt;&gt; the wine press. falls heavy, but it is bringing forth the only &gt;&gt; the best. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on. The best. [Music] &gt;&gt; Don't slack him now. Press press of that beautiful lady. &gt;&gt; One last time into thy chamber. &gt;&gt; Into thy chamber, &gt;&gt; be free. Holy Spirit, &gt;&gt; speak to me gently. Speak to me gently &gt;&gt; as I close &gt;&gt; as I close the door. &gt;&gt; Heavenly lover, &gt;&gt; heavenly lover. And thy presence covered [Music] is all I long for. You are worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; Worship the Lord with him now. Let it come from your inner being. &gt;&gt; You are worthy of it all. Let the spirit of the Lord surround you as you stand here tonight. &gt;&gt; For from you are all things and are all things. &gt;&gt; Change us. &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; Open our eyes to see. &gt;&gt; Lord, you are worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; May we go in one way and come out another. You are worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; Maybe he said about us on the other side. They're just like him. &gt;&gt; For you are all things. &gt;&gt; They smell like him. They live like him. They move like him. &gt;&gt; God, you deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; Oh God, it's not about anybody but you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus. and all the saints. &gt;&gt; Come on, worship him. &gt;&gt; Bow before your throne. &gt;&gt; Love on him before we go. &gt;&gt; And all the elders cast &gt;&gt; cast their crowns &gt;&gt; crowns before the lamb of God. And master, you're worthy. You are worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; He's calling you. &gt;&gt; He's calling you. &gt;&gt; Worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; Come and stand under my pavilion. &gt;&gt; Come hide in my tabernacle. &gt;&gt; May you be found beneath the fountains of my tent. My God, God on Zion is for you. &gt;&gt; You are worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; He's calling you into his word, &gt;&gt; Lord. You are worthy of it all. [Music] For from you. &gt;&gt; Don't be afraid to follow him. into all things. &gt;&gt; Go in and let the veil fall behind you, &gt;&gt; shutting you into the room within the room. &gt;&gt; The holiest of holies. &gt;&gt; You are worthy of it all. You are worthy of all. &gt;&gt; You'll never teach Pentecostal babies. &gt;&gt; You are worthy of it all &gt;&gt; how to see in the spirit. &gt;&gt; Oh, for you are. Let him grow you up in the wine press. &gt;&gt; Let him throw you up in the vessel of misunderstanding. Glory &gt;&gt; day and night, night and day. &gt;&gt; That's your praise. That's your praise. &gt;&gt; That's the essence of what he's doing in your life. Let it rise and night and day. Let it bridal intercise. [Music] &gt;&gt; Nobody has his heart like this. [Music] both day and night, night and day. Let it srise day and night. Night and day [Music] and night, night and day. You are worthy of Jesus. Lord, you are worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; Don't rush yourself. &gt;&gt; Stand in his booth. &gt;&gt; Offer up. You are all &gt;&gt; cover us, Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Like Ruth, &gt;&gt; you deserve. May we find ourselves underneath the garment of Boaz, our kinsman, redeemer, &gt;&gt; worthy of it all. [Music] Oh Lord, you are worthy of it all. Oh, for you are all things and you are all things. You deserve God. You deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; Oh, you're worthy of it, &gt;&gt; Lord. You are worthy of it all. [Music] You are worthy, Lord. You are worthy of it all. From you for you are all to &gt;&gt; you deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; You deserve the glory. &gt;&gt; Anoint our eyes with thyself tonight. &gt;&gt; May wish your breath in our lungs. So we pour out our praise. We pour out our praise into your breath. your breath in our lives. So we pour out our praise to you. It's your breath in our lives. So we pour out our praise. We pour out our praise. &gt;&gt; Don't you want to know our voice? So we pour out our praise to you. &gt;&gt; Don't you want this message that God has given us to drop from your head to your heart? &gt;&gt; Lord, let it become a part of you. &gt;&gt; No matter what's happening around me, &gt;&gt; bring light to the place of rest. &gt;&gt; Rest is a revelation. Every heart that is broken and great are great are you Lord. It's your breath in our lives. So we pour out our praise. Lord, we pour out our praises in your &gt;&gt; in our lungs. So we pour out our praise to you [Music] in our lives. So we pour out our praise. We pour out our praise. It's your breath in our lungs. So we pour out our praise to you. &gt;&gt; The misunderstandings can become an identity. You can begin to believe the report &gt;&gt; that others say about you. you can begin to believe the lie. The enemy will make sure that you hear it often enough that you'll begin to feel some connection with the false report of who you are and you'll lose your identity in Christ and you begin to be this messed up person. I hear people speaking of themselves that way. I'm messed up. I'm messed up. Um, I want to ask the Lord to give his bride in this house tonight. No matter where you're from and you're streaming the service, I want to ask the Lord to give you grace to break off every false report that the enemy has issued against your life. &gt;&gt; And the misunderstanding didn't come to make you bitter. It came to make you better. &gt;&gt; And the offense that came to your life, it didn't come to stay. It came to transform. It came to bring perfection. It came to tune you. The loss that you've known, the rejection that you've known, it didn't come to defeat you. It came to promote you. And somehow we've gotten caught up in the identity of what we have been through. And it's what we want to tell people when we come in contact with them. You just don't know what I've been through. The Lord wants to break that off of us &gt;&gt; so that we can be fully occupied by him. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And begin to see ourselves as the word has seen us &gt;&gt; in his image. If you feel like you have agreed, you've come into agreement with some of the misunderstandings about your life, some of the lies, some of the attacks, some of the tales, if you feel like you've come into some agreement with that and you'd like for some grace to fall upon you to break that off this evening, let me see your hand if you understand what I'm saying. I'm not trying to talk mysteriously. Would you be willing to just put your hand over your head like that? I'm not trying to be crazy. May we just believe God right now to break off heavy bands. I know more than saw that. I mean, I know more than said that, but what I could see like iron bands &gt;&gt; around our heads representing the lies that we believed about ourselves and the false identities that we have taken on because of what we have been through. It's affecting us. It's impeding our spiritual growth. It's keeping us in a perpetual immaturity when we desire to grow up in Christ into the stature of the perfect man. So I pray right now I join my faith with the faith of this little people represented in this house tonight. We are not a product of what we've been through. &gt;&gt; We are not defined by what we have known by the misunderstandings that have surrounded our life. That is not who we are. &gt;&gt; And we ask you to come by the grace of God and break off every heavy band. &gt;&gt; That has tried to reidentify us as victims. When you are our victory, &gt;&gt; Jesus is the victor. &gt;&gt; You defeated death, hell, and the grave. &gt;&gt; You are my victory. You are my victory. And so we take authority by the word over everything the enemy has used to keep us in this vessel of misunderstanding so that we'll never be delivered from the things that need to be left behind. And we we launch forth into the goodness of God. We cast ourselves before the goodness of God and we say, "Move us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Move us into the identity of your word." &gt;&gt; May we confess over our lives what your word says about us. May we declare and decree over our lives what your word has said. Someone said today, "I'm losing my mind. It's a lie from the pit of hell. &gt;&gt; I would keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on me. &gt;&gt; He's a liar and the father of all lies. It's not your mind you're losing. It's your false security. &gt;&gt; It's the things that you've found comfortable &gt;&gt; that God wants to move you past. &gt;&gt; I want to set you on a rock. His word said, &gt;&gt; I want to put a song in your mouth. Upon my rock. I want to give you a hiding place in the pavilion, in the tabernacle, in the refuge of the Lord. I want you to spend some time beneath the folds of my tent. That's what his word is saying to us. And the Lord knows I want it. And if you're some kind of strange uh thinker and you and you think I I don't I don't know how to relate to this kind of intimacy. I'm a man. I'm a man's man. I'm a masculine man. Let me tell you, one minute before his throne, one minute in the presence of the revealed Christ, &gt;&gt; and you'll quickly find the emotional side of who you are, &gt;&gt; undone before him. &gt;&gt; Men like to say things like, "Cry like a woman. Cry like a baby." You hear men saying that. That's exactly what you'll do if you ever get undone in his presence. You'll cry like a woman. You'll cry like a baby. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And let it bring a purging. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; By the time we reach this age in life, we shouldn't still be what we were raised to be. We should be more. My family, my family, my family, my parents, my family, my childhood, my upbringing, what I've been through. Oh, folks. Come on. &gt;&gt; You're a new creature. &gt;&gt; Come on. Behold, old things are passed away. Behold, all things have become new. &gt;&gt; You say, "I didn't know the love of an earthly father, nor did I. But I have known the love &gt;&gt; of a creator. &gt;&gt; I have known the love of an aba. &gt;&gt; I have known the love of a papa." &gt;&gt; There's no way in the world that a love could be produced on this earth that would begin to measure the love that he has loved us with. &gt;&gt; Find your identity in his love. Lord, I rest in the love of my papa. I rest in the love of my Abba, my creator, my king, my lord. &gt;&gt; Move me past my past. &gt;&gt; Say it with me. Move me past my past. &gt;&gt; Move me past my past. May I soar above &gt;&gt; what has sought to hold me back. Jesus, if you feel comfortable, take somebody near you if it's appropriate to do so. Take somebody near you by the hand. We're going to pray one more prayer, then worship just a bit and leave. We're have a nice meal, nice fellowship together. Church in the morning 11:00. Lord, I stand in agreement. I Here's one thing I know. The person next to me has been through stuff. Two, heartache two, misunderstanding, two, troubles, two, loss, rejection, pain, heartache two. I am not alone in this house. I'm surrounded by people who have felt the sting of life and its circumstances. And so, Lord, I'm at home with your people. Together, we have known what it's like to be earthbound by our circumstances. Tonight, we pray that you will let us know what it means to be heaven heaven bound, to soar above it all. You sent the anointing of a flying eagle to bring us out of the rest of the of the rest of Leodysia. May we come up above it in the anointing of a flying eagle who says, "I wasn't born to peck around in the circumstances and the carry on of yesterday." You've got fresh meat on the mountain. Just let me get back to the rock from where I was born. Let me get back to the rock of my birth. Let me get back to the high place you've called me to. In you. In you. Not a high place in pride. A high place in you. &gt;&gt; Woo. &gt;&gt; Where we're free. We stand holding hands because it's a point of contact. Let faith arise. Let victory arise in the heart of these brothers and sisters. Thank God for what you've done for us. Thank God for where you brought us from. Thank God for where you've taken us to. Oh hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Put a shout in our heart &gt;&gt; when we talk. Let us talk of your wonderful works. Let us talk of your precious revealed word. Let us see it like we've never seen it before until we demonstrate it in this wicked world around us. Spirit of God. We're not looking for emotion right now. We're looking for a shift in the deepest part of who we are. Put your finger, Lord, on the deepest part of who we are. Awaken the seed of destiny. Awaken the gene life of God. Whoa. &gt;&gt; Awaken that which you've planted in us &gt;&gt; for eternal purposes. Oh, &gt;&gt; we say come alive. Come alive in the authority of Jesus Christ. Come alive. Resurrection life. [Music] &gt;&gt; Resurrection life in his bride, in his wife. Resurrection life. I stood before the Lord one time many years ago in the spirit. &gt;&gt; I saw Mount Zion before me like a huge pyramid-shaped mountain. And I saw it in convulsions and contractions. And I didn't understand it. But the word of the Lord came and said, "Zion is having birth painans for the sons that are going to be born by the word." Born by the word. Born by the word. Hallelujah. You've known the contractions. You've known the squeeze. You've known the birth pains. It's time for sons to step forth in the authority of the king. [Music] &gt;&gt; How? [Music] There'll probably be more misunderstanding after this service, &gt;&gt; so brace yourself. &gt;&gt; Whoa. &gt;&gt; Let me lose myself and find myself in you. I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired. I'm tired of looking in the mirror and seeing myself. I'm ready to look in the mirror and see the man in the mirror. &gt;&gt; I'm ready to see the Christ looking back at me. That's the promise of the New Testament covenant. We are to become like what we look upon. We look upon your beauty tonight in faith. We see you as a beautiful savior. We see you as the only hope. We see you as the only God, the only true God, the only truth, the only absolute is found in you, not in sinful flesh. We gaze upon you to live. We see your goodness. We thank you for mercy who follows us. We thank you for goodness following us. Hallelujah. And we shake off. I I I hope you won't be embarrassed. But I hope somebody if you were willing to put your bands on your head, surely you'll just move your arms like this as an act of faith. That's all it is. There's no no trick in it. I'm not saying it's some magical motion. I'm just telling you just shake off. &gt;&gt; I just shake off those things by the spirit of God that bind me, that restrict me. I tell you, uh it's embarrassing sometimes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just just think about those crazy people who scream and shout over the football game. &gt;&gt; They're not ashamed. &gt;&gt; You shouldn't be ashamed either. I I refuse that stuff. I just shake it off in the name of Jesus Christ. I I'm going to come out of this like him, like him, like his word. &gt;&gt; I don't want the sympathy of man. I want the comforter of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Sing again. It's what? Something that or something else. Little girl was lying there. The people are weeping. &gt;&gt; I want you to look at the brothers and sisters. &gt;&gt; God bless you. When he said she's only sleeping, &gt;&gt; shake a hand, hug a neck. &gt;&gt; As he took her by the hand, &gt;&gt; I'm in the &gt;&gt; she be to live again. Some be to praise the Lord. Some be to say [Music] that he's in the house. &gt;&gt; He's been here with us. Death has to flee. &gt;&gt; And now there is life where darkness used to be. &gt;&gt; And now there is hope. There's no more doubt. Praise his name. Oh, praise his name. He's in the house. And he's in the house. Death has to flee. And now there is life for all the darkness it used to be. And now there is hope. There's no more doubt. Praise his name. Praise his name. He's in the house. We were like that little girl dead in all our sins. &gt;&gt; So Jesus touched this heart of mine and he gave me life again. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm just a house of clay. But ever since that last blessing day, there's a light that shines in me for all the world to see. That he's in the house. So death has to flee. And now there is light for all the darkness used to be. And now there is hope. You see there's no more doubt. Somebody praise his name. Come on and praise his name. Cuz he's in the house. So death has to bleed. And now there is a light for all the darkness it used to be. And now there is hope. Oh, there's no more now. Praise his name. Praise his name. He's in the house. [Music] &gt;&gt; We were like that little girl dead in all our sins. Till Jesus touched this heart of mine and gave me life again. Oh, I am just a house of clay. But ever since that blessed day, there's a light that shines in me so all the world can see [Music] that he's in my house. So death has to flee. And now there is light where all your darkness used to be. And now there is hope. You see there's no more doubt. Praise his name. Come on and praise his name. Cuz he's in the house. So death has to flee. Oh, now there is life where your darkness used to be. Oh, now there is hope. You see there's no more now. Somebody praise his name. Praise his name cuz he's in the house.

So death has to flee. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And now there is life for all the darkness used to be. &gt;&gt; Now there is hope. There's no more now. Praise his name. Praise his name. Our father, we are so blessed to be in your presence. The word that we have heard tonight igniting some igniting something in us Lord, I worship you, [Music] Lord, as we fellowship together down in the fellowship hall. Would you let our fellowship be sweet, &gt;&gt; edifying, uplifting? Thank you for the food that has been provided. Would you sanctify it for our use? &gt;&gt; Lord, I pray for our pastor that you will renew him and strengthen him as we would rest on the bed tonight. God, refresh us that we may come back tomorrow to press in farther for what you have desired to speak to us this weekend. We bless you and honor you and give you praise in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Thank you, Lord. Amen. You are invited to have fellowship with us down in the fellowship hall down under the hill. We've been very blessed as we came on the ground today that there was no red mud running across the parking lot. &gt;&gt; We'd like to keep it that way. So, we're asking that if you drive down to the bottom that you stay on the gravel. That means not even one wheel in the red mud because that stuff tracks and we don't want to track it and we don't want we we we don't want any stuck vehicles. So, it may be that some of us will have to walk down. So, be mindful of that. Please allow our seniors to be able to get down there. Perhaps carpool, our visitors, but we just want you to come and fellowship with you with us. There's plenty of food. The Lord bless you. Service in the morning at 11:00. So many times I've questioned C. circumstances and things I could not understand. [Music] &gt;&gt; And many times in trials, weakness blurs my vision. That's when my frustration gets so out of hand. But it's then I am reminded I've never been forsaken and I've never had to stand one test alone. That's when I look at all the victories and the spirit rises up in me. It's through the fire. My weaknesses are made strong. cuz he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. Cuz he never offered our victories without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. Just remember when you're standing in the valley of decision and the adversary says give in. Oh, just hold on cuz my Lord will show up. Yes. And he will take you through the fire again. I know within myself that I would surely perish. Oh, but if I trust the mighty hand of God, he'll shield the flames again. Oh, cuz he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. No, cuz he never offered our victories without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. Just remember when you're standing in your valley of decision and the adversaries says just give in. Just hold on. Cuz my Lord, he'll show up. Yes. And he will take you through the fire again. No. Oh, cuz he never promised that the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. No. And he never offered one victory without fighting. But he said help would always come in time. Just remember when you're standing in your valley of decision and the adversaries says just give in. Just hold on. Oh my Lord it'll show up. Yes. said he will take you through the fire again. Sing it one last time. He never promised. No, he never promised. That the cross would not get heavy and the hill would not be hard to climb. No. And he never offered our victories without fighting. But he said hell would always come in time. Just remember when you're standing in your valley of decision and that old adversary says, "Why don't you just give in? Just hold on. Cuz my Lord will show up." Yes. And he will take you through the fire again. [Music] You're dismissed to go tonight.
