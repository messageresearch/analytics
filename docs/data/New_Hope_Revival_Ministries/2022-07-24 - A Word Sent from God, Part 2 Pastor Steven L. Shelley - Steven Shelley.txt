we know that god is with him sister anita needs our prayers we need to hold her up to the lord she needs strength and help and leadership from the lord i don't like to mention mine too much but i have at least two medical decisions that i need to make perhaps even this week and i've been putting it off and hoping for a miracle i know god is a miracle-working god but i won't be able to continue to go much longer with these two things i need god's help with if if he lifts my faith today i'm willing to hold out longer i believe it i know he's more than able and i need his leadership all right amen and like you've already requested prayer for those traveling some are not here today because they were exposed or could have been exposed or might have been exposed some are not here because they

you lord for all you're doing in us and with us jesus we give you praise and honor and glory in jesus name amen [Music] oh hallelujah we give you the praise lord to you be glory and honor and praise mighty god hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah glory my sin all the bliss of this glorious thought my sin not in part but the whole that means what's past and what i may do in the future any unbelief that i had in the past and any that i may have in the future it was nailed as a hole to his cross and i bury it no more i come back to him in repentance and he has already taken care of it but i just keep in covenan with him day by day by day oh hallelujah thank you lord you can have your seats today praise the lord i want to honor ben and all of these musicians for stepping in today and helping us to press into the presence of the lord and i thank you as well for coming with a mind made up to press into the presence of the lord to create atmosphere if you will allow me just a couple of minutes i would like to tell you a couple of things that are going on i would like to thank luke and nathan for helping us to get that sidewalk jacked up we had somebody to fall last week and i leaned pretty heavy on luke because he is more up to date with some of the building techniques and so we were able to get that jacked up rather than paying 2 500 for professionals to do it we did it and so it is level now it is safe once again and so i'm thankful to the lord for that we want to thank brother david mann though he is not here this air conditioner got put in place i know nathan was helping him i'm not sure who else brother robert these brothers got this air conditioner in place yesterday and hooked up so it is cooling this morning and we're thankful for that and we want to honor to pay go ahead it's paid for we're so grateful to the lord for that [Applause] i would like to announce to you that the prayer chapels are now ready for use [Applause] [Music] [Applause] i would like to in a couple of weeks to rededicate them we put as little money in them as we possibly could we started out with a new roof april of 2020 they are climate controlled and as long as the lord provides i would like to keep them that way when you walk in to the left the remote control is there they are set currently on 73 degrees if you want it colder you can lower it if you want it warmer you can raise it just put it back at 73 degrees before you leave so that we can keep them climate controlled and comfortable there are new shades on the windows so you can feel private you don't feel like anybody's looking in on you and so right now i think that we need to not worry about new furniture we'll do that in a little while but we've got some other things that we need to tend to here on the campground namely this parking lot this parking lot is breaking apart we've got to get it resealed and so it's really necessary that we focus on that but uh i just wanted you to know that the prayer chapels are now ready for you to go in they're clean repaired i would ask that you don't scrutinize them too much i didn't build them and luke didn't build them their the ceilings are pretty wavy but they're freshly painted there's no broken sheetrock tape and so they're they're all i want to thank brother hawk for helping us to get the painting i want to thank brother steve polk for helping us to get the flooring because of brother steve polk the flooring in the doorways we didn't have to pay for it his company provided that and brother steve helped us to get it down i appreciate that brother steve brother david mann help us to get the new air conditioners installed and so they are ready for use and we're so thankful to the lord for that yes and you give god the glory because that's how it would want that's how folks want it to be is that god receives the glory and the praise but can i just tell you that during that whole restoration process that brother greeley started on his own and i thank god for those that came in and helped not one receipt has been turned in for reimbursement so as far as i know not one penny has come out of the church account to do that it has been done it has been taken care of i think we ought to really give god praise for providing it that way thank you lord thank you lord [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] it it was not inexpensive there's a lot of money involved in redoing anything and sometimes a little bit more when you're trying to redo but i really appreciate the fact that it was done that way and we didn't have to we didn't have to squeeze or or or you know borrow from peter to pay paul we were able to continue to take care of jerusalem we were able to continue to take care of the insurance we were able to continue to gather this money which will be your next announcement that's exactly right this is now this really this right here really really makes me happy because this week an eight thousand dollar payment was made on this property so that means as of today 232 355.96 has been given directly for the principle of the mortgage of this property that means that right now the current balance is at the halfway of where we started 238 258 dollars and 26 cents halfway folks in 16 months halfway by the goodness of god [Applause] the end is in sight friends we're going to pay this property off and we're going to do everything that god called us to do on this property i am expecting it to be fully accomplished because god's grace is so sufficient for us it doesn't matter what the naysayers might say god keeps his word amen he keeps his word praise the lord current balance when we started 479 279 dollars and 30 cents 37 cents today 238 258 dollars and 26 cents that is a miracle from the lord and i bless you in the name of the lord and all of those that have given over the course of these 16 months god is gracious we want to receive the tithe and offering we're going to come to you for the tithing offering brother joshua llano sister jaya shelton are coming to sing so come on and get ready we are going to let the the brothers come to you today uh let's see who can i call on everybody's busy brother austin brother elias we're going to let you two brothers go to the people let me just pray over before they come to you our father we are here to say thank you we are here with grateful hearts for how that you have seen us through year after year after year and you have allowed us to keep this property because it's yours it's yours lord and so i want to bless the people today in the name of the lord jesus christ i want to thank you lord for the tithe that they sow into the kingdom they keep covenant with you and i want to thank you that they give offerings as unto the lord and i pray god as they've brought theirs today that you would just bless them let blessing flow into their home let it be multiplied for the purposes of the kingdom father i know that there's a lot of giving online and we want to bless those as well god every cent that comes into this ministry we give praise to our lord jesus christ and we thank you lord for your faithful people will give you

praised you may be seated again this morning i um austin i have a white towel on my someone laid a white towel on my desk would you bring it to me today the lord is so good and he's so faithful and uh we're just a little over 50 gathered here this morning and so many are out to protect us and for us to protect them and we we just want to make sure that we don't do anything to to spread unnecessarily this virus but i just want you to think of one thing i want you to think of the fact that this corona thank you thank you oh he's anticipating a double header um i don't know who laid those there i don't think these are the ones i got but thank you so much whoever did i appreciate it um and oh they smell good uh what was i saying thank you but you know that those different strains of virus have been around for a long time and you've had it many many times before it got to covet 19. you may have had it 18 other times i don't know how many times and that's why when it first came out they were showing on the lysol can that lysol would take care of that particular those strains that we were getting and now that we test we're going to be testing forever some people are going to be testing forever it seems but i do appreciate the fact that you all who got these symptoms you work also in the public and you test it and i appreciate you doing that and letting us know and pulling aside a little bit and uh because there are some elderly people here and uh yes you know it's coming you know it's coming don't you so i said to david because he's been in the house with ashley and i guess i guess you all are living together these days and she had the she had tested positive and the cdc is saying five days now at home away from the public and then you go out with a tightly fit fitting mask which i'm missing this morning but anyway um so i said to david no you all come but just be careful with the elderly you know just just be a little bit mindful of that and so david says something like this you know well i guess that means you won't get any hugs tomorrow calling me elderly yeah calling me elderly and i don't want his hugs any when i'm kidding i'm kidding and i guess compared to some of you i am antique but uh um i i i don't want to feel that way do you i want to want to feel good and uh so thank you so much the lord has been good to all of us this week and uh brother greeley mentioned ben and he mentioned him because he just came off this morning a 12-hour shift and i know that was hard to come right over here and uh and do what he has done but but what about miss emily you know just uh she was our first baby one of our very first babies born when i came to be the pastor here and there she is just shining on the piano let's thank god for that i'm glad that olivia found her courage when she was asked to fill in on the keyboard and i appreciate her for doing that and and she's very capable so we just it was just amazing how everything came together it looked a little dim all of our regular piano players gone and some of the ones we were considering asking gone and uh but you know ben was very i don't know how he was at home kendra but he was just very helpful very even-tempered about it with me anyway and he just arranged it and he just called on different ones and um you know i don't know how how much a piano playing brother josh does but he was willing to get up here and you know when you can sing like they sung it doesn't even matter they could have done that acapella but i appreciate him getting in there and i appreciate chad obeying the lord without having to be asked and and i was just taking back that he asked me because he he knows that he can always look folks you can obey the lord if you know it's the lord you can obey the lord you can obey the lord and i'm glad he did because we can honestly say today that it is well it is well no matter what it looks like or smells like or sounds like it is well and then i once again appreciate all these wonderful reports that brother greeley gave us today god is helping us along and you know the thought of having to resurface which is a very expensive project and the thought of that used to would have just overwhelmed me but you know how could you be overwhelmed with that when you see what the lord can do if you let him and i trust that god is giving back to you pressed down shaken together and running over if you're doing without food or doing without necessities to give i wouldn't encourage that beyond your tithe but if god if you're giving with the right heart i believe god is giving back to you and i don't believe you're missing it because that's just the way it works in the economy of heaven if you believe that same man so i want to say happy birthday today to uh our sister judith who has been away from us now for quite a while with her parents in edmonton and i want to say uh to to many of us she is sister judith to many of us she is juju and we love her very much and we want her day to be blessed and uh we we hope that that this will be a good birthday knowing that she's with her parents and that her family here loves her very much so can we just say happy birthday to sister judith in edmonton god bless you today sister rhonda shaw has a birthday on wednesday of this week so let's say happy birthday to her [Applause] i saw that the high seas wedding anniversary would have been celebrated this week and even though both of them are in the presence of the lord we miss them and we think about them often when i look at my facebook memories very very often there will be a note from sister heisi on there making some comment about the sermon the service what god did and how he moved and that's still encouraging me you don't ever know you don't think about the fact that after you're gone somebody's going to be reading your encouragement and on wednesday of this week would be sister weem's wedding anniversary as well on friday i think it'd be friday of this coming week so we want to say happy anniversary to her as well her husband is gone but uh it was a special time and to be remembered we miss the hawksons in iceland and we're going to miss the west singers as they go home for the summer to uh to be with rj's family we're just it's ju was a uh not a good set of circumstances maybe that kept him here a little longer than they planned but i sure am glad this morning that that's the way it turned out and i'm very anxious to have my kids our kids home um tomorrow from jamaica and uh they've been so good to us and i know they have to hurt parents as well to keep us posted to send us pictures to facetime us you know you say well i don't i wouldn't do that on my honeymoon well maybe you don't love your parents like they love theirs but i sure appreciated it it was very nice knowing that at least for a fainting moment of the day they thought about us i appreciated that and i'm looking forward to having them home god has just been good to us all right let's thank god for these musicians every one of them let's send ben home i think he's going home to sleep we're not going to hold that against him we just appreciate him being here i want kendra to make sure he watches the archives to get the sermon because he needs it like all the rest of us do and if he happens to sleep through volleyball we understand there's just not enough emojis for things like that are there anyway god is so good let me just take a minute since this has been i love the atmosphere this morning it's been a little more relaxed and brother greeley just sharing i like it it felt like family not that we don't miss those that we do but we know that they're on the other end but i want to mention the netherlands and ghana and norway i see sister hannah has made it back with her son to norway from tucson god bless you all and uh trinidad and here is a brother greeting us from morocco so we send our love to you today brother in morocco and here is indiana and uh our sister is asking us to pray for the congregation in israel well sister i think maybe you you are perhaps filipino living in israel i don't know for sure i'm just trying to go by your tiny little picture but i want you to know that this church is praying for the congregation in israel and we have been praying for you for many years in 2002 god laid it on our hearts and we have been praying that that the saints would be able to gather and encourage one another and bless one another in israel and so you all are never far from our hearts we know that you all have gone through some hardships there's been difficult times along the way but god has sustained his people in the land of the bible and i believe he will continue to do so in fact i would just say to you the best is yet to come in israel i believe that with all my heart god is not nearly through brother writers from cape town south africa god bless you our precious friend and all these others who are greeting us but we don't know exactly where from we send our love to you let's stand and get ready for the word of god today charity was unable to be here she has some mild symptoms and enough that she didn't want to ignore them brother daniel and sister anna miller or somewhere somewhere in the world busy and i'll just tell you that uh pulling mobile homes or motor homes or travel trailers that's the least of what they are busy with they're always ministering to somebody always answering somebody's call and praying for somebody and so we bless them on the road and i i appreciate mariah she has not been putting in the quotes and things until today and she was quite distraught this morning that she wouldn't be able to do it but i understand that she's done all right at it and i want to thank her and appreciate appreciate her for doing that this is a time for cross-training i want you to hear me because i think it's a little bit spiritual uh this is a time to train uh and kind of cross over in other words if we've got all these people sitting out here that can play the piano they need to be playing the piano that's right we need to put some uh second string third string on tuesday nights and get them used to playing our songs we have guitar players that don't get to play we need to get them up here get them playing on tuesday nights let's see how they do come on we've got violin violinists and we've got i don't know i think even flautist i'm going to have to pray about that one but anyway we have people who have talent it just takes a little bit of skill to put in the quotes it just takes a little bit of skill to run that projector these cameras we need cameramen we need backup on the sound we we just we have the jobs we just want to make it available to those who desire to help us it's not right for somebody to have to do it all the time and never get to be a complete part of the service and the truth is some just do it so well until we just want them doing it but but we need to cross train here because we have busy times ahead and we are maintaining two services a week but we anticipate that with what god is doing we will have to go to three services at some point because the people are crying out for it and so we've got to be ready to meet that need and so uh anyway i just happened to say to the brothers on sunday afternoon in my office we got to do something about that sidewalk that little lady fell and hurt her foot toe toe and and we've got to do something about it and that was all i said and then days later somebody said well did you see that the sidewalk was fixed well no i don't walk on the sidewalk very often it was already done finished and i didn't even know it was done that's god he just provided he put that on their heart they got it done before we could ever i could ever go out there and look at it it was already fixed this means that people are feeling their their responsibility to god's work and you may you may not call this revival but it is revival because when our hearts are reconnected with the work of the lord we are in some form of revival personal revival that makes us see the need and others who can't be here to physically do that but who give extra and they say wherever the need is just put it on the need and brother david has really worked hard and sacrificed in the heat they said he was a wet just a dripping wet man yesterday after being up there and all those who helped him oftentimes we don't even know who does what so it's good that we take this opportunity to thank all of you for what you do if you walk over a piece of trash shame on you pick it up if you step over a water bottle don't be that kind of a person if you see a weed don't wait on somebody else to pluck it if you're able pluck it then you have an investment then you are making a part and you'll get the blessing i'm telling you you'll get the blessing anybody here ephesians chapter 1. i'm going to need your help today this is going to be part 2 of a word sent from god and we're going to be doing a lot of quotations because we didn't get them in on sunday but all of you that were here last sunday i want you to just remind yourself of what you were hearing and i had so many comments that came back and said i loved the end of the service when brother greeley and brother austin were preaching the message back to you i loved that people loved it they thought now that's one way to make sure people get it is have them to express it and so you just start thinking now i want you to see before we read that the holy spirit is brooding over the water and the seed of god is laying there want you to remember all of that i want you to remember the scriptures that were read because we're going to move forward ephesians chapter 1 beginning in verse 3 all the way to verse 12 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who have blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy i want you to say holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will why did he do it because it pleased him to do it i like that did you know you are here because it brought the father pleasure to place you here at this time in the earth and even in this body if you listen to what brother branham was saying he did it according to the good pleasure of his will to the pray to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he had made us accepted in the beloved i appreciate that in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace don't ever let predestination cause you to diminish in your heart your appreciation for the blood and for the grace of god blood was the token price but grace was the vehicle that got that blood to you had it not been for grace the blood could have been there but it wouldn't have been on you it wouldn't have been for you but grace brought us to the blood and the blood finished the work wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will i'm so thankful that we can know the reason according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself we're still reading that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance hallelujah being pre and notice that we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh let's read that together all things after the council of his own will he didn't have to take counsel with anybody else he didn't have to call a committee meeting with anybody else he took counsel from his own will praise god for that that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ we are to be the praise of his glory our life is the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ let's pray together father we thank you this morning that you have secured us by your great predestinated plan you have redeemed us by your grace you saved us by your blood price you purchased us and by the life of that blood you filled us with who you are your very essence your very spirit we now know that we started in your mind as a thought even as an attribute but even as you were expressed in flesh we also have been expressed in flesh for such a time as this lord may we never forget that we are not here to do our own will we are not here to fulfill our own purpose or our own desire but we are here to fulfill the word of the father and even as our lord said i can do nothing except it be revealed to me of my father in heaven may your bride recognize that we too have this mandate to discover what father desires for our lives and to live it by surrender and by obedience we thank you for this time together and we ask that you let our attention be drawn to your word so that it might have maximum impact in our life we give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the church said a little louder you may be seated god is good i am a word sent from god if you believe that say amen i am a word sent from god now in the message things that are to be i want you to see i want you to to uh get this in your heart today that when we say i was once a thought in the mind of god brother branham says that thoughts are equal to attributes do you understand are you do you understand what i'm saying a thought is the same as an attribute brother branham said an attribute is a thought now we hear him talking about god expressing these attributes and he names some of them he said it was in god meaning in his mind to be a father it was in god to be a healer it was in his mind to be a redeemer to be a deliverer he said these were attributes of god in another place he said it was in him to be a father it was in him to be a son it was in him to be holy ghost he said also these are attributes of god i want you to know who you are the same thing that was in god that caused him to have the desire to be a healer that's what you are you're a thought that has been expressed you were once a thought that was actually an attribute in the mind of god i want to make sure that you don't just look at the word attribute as though it were a characteristic or as though it were a job to do or an office to fulfill i want you to know that every thought in the mind of god before the foundation of the world was an attribute in itself hallelujah so what did god do somebody had to be sick so that god could uh express himself as a healer so god had a thought you were that thought you were that attribute and in order for that thought or that attribute to come to pass and to fulfill his will you had to be spoken because a word is a thought that has been spoken or that has been expressed i want to go back to things that are to be in paragraph 33 we're going to study a little bit maybe not preach as much but study a little bit together he said now if we are those attributes of god because there's going to be those who hear this and hear last sunday and they're going to say i think you're taking it a little bit too far when you say that i am a word sent from god because people are a little nervous about you placing yourself with the bible that's exactly where you're supposed to be placed in the bible if john 3 16 is a word sent from god so is stephen lamar shelly now you you you've got to understand the thought you've got to understand the attribute to be able to draw that comparison and understand we're talking about the same thing a thought expressed now if we are those attributes of god we cannot live by creeds there are creeds outside of the message they have even built some creeds around the message yes creeds man's ideas man's ideas that don't line up with the book with the word i want to get rid of that in my life i don't want to live by any creed i want to live by the word we cannot live by denominationalism brother branham said that's mark of the beast all right we go on we must live by the word why because the bride is a part of the bridegroom now who is the bridegroom jesus christ lord jesus christ is our bridegroom you're a part of the bridegroom bride is a part of the bridegroom so you are a part of the lord jesus christ is that all right to know it's powerful to know he said why because the bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband but i would like to say to brother branham now this could get me in big trouble but i would like to say to brother adam that the relationship between the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride is a higher order i would like to say that the relationship between a husband and a wife on the earth is patterned after that relationship not the other way around i would just like to kind of clarify that without making any any there's no correction to be made here it's just drawing your attention to the fact that that relationship that you have with him is of a higher order and anything we do down here is based on that relationship he said therefore we must be that word bride i'm a part of the word i'm a part of the word i am a word sent from god all right and he said and what is that word bride question the manifestation of this hour the manifestation of this hour the bride when the word manifests itself in this hour it does it in bride form how is the word manifested in this hour word form now you believe christ has come how many of you believe christ has come does anybody believe he is coming but that he has come he's come in word form he's coming now in bride form he's coming again in a body form there it is and that's not somebody making it up that's exactly what we've seen in our day the lord jesus christ himself has descended in word form in the message of the hour we are now at the closing of the gentile dispensation and at the closing of the gentile dispensation another coming is being revealed it's his coming in bride form which is a many-membered body form amen it came in one body all the way through but now he's coming in many membered body form meaning you and i oh hallelujah in a minute i just can't hardly wait to get there but in a minute you're going to find out why you had to be transferred from the mind of god as an attribute to the earth there was a very distinct reason why god wanted to get you out of his mind and into the fulfillment of his plan and i want you to be able to see that in just a minute all right he said the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination and may i say or an organization because when you start identifying yourself as an organization you're identifying yourself with creeds of man the word of god cannot be organized the word of god cannot be denominationalized the word of god cannot be changed into a creed if you believe that same man he said the manifestation of this hour the bride not a creed or a denomination but a living what is an oracle a word a living oracle of god that's who you are you are a living oracle of god be careful what you say because you're a living oracle of god look at after the comma a living attribute of god i'm just coming out of this this morning a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes of god whoop in the formation of the bride my lord of mercy come on but a living oracle of god a living attribute of god displaying to the world the attributes plural of god in the formation of the bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living hallelujah there was a bunch of attributes that could not be expressed in ephesus there was a bunch of attributes that could not be expressed in smyrna or pergamus or thyatera philadelphia any of the other church ages they could only be expressed in the last days in the hour that we're now living in when there would be a real formation of the bride anybody here remember when i was in jerusalem and he caught me up into a heavenly place and introduced me to the messengers of the seven church ages now that's one thing i know is real now i know there's some controversy there we might not have the dates just right but we've got the messengers right because i've had a confirmation that that it is so and in that experience i was told that in the same way that all the evil of the other ages of the church ages that all the evil was gathered together into the age of laodicea so everything evil from ephesus and smyrna and pergamus and all these other church ages it was gathered together and expressed again in laodicea the most evil and wicked age the age of people's rights the most evil and wicked age of all the other church ages are you with me but remember he told me in that experience that in the same way in the same manner that all the evil of all the other church ages had been gathered into laodicea he said i have also gathered together the overcoming portion hallelujah so not only is this the culmination of evil in laodicea but it's also the culmination of all the overcoming portions so what god gave to ephesus and what god gave to smyrna and what god gave to all of these other pergamos and all the other church ages he has gathered together to form a bride like no other who will come out of laodicea she will have experienced the evil of every church age but she will come forth with the overcoming power that was given to all the other church ages why because christ has to come in bribed form he has to he's come in word for him he has to come in bride form hallelujah we're not preaching church ages book here we're preaching what the prophet said in the sermons all righty goes on i got to read the rest of this martin luther could not express think of this you know in that experience i had quite a quite a conversation with martin luther for those of you that hadn't read it he he apologized to me that's pretty humbling because he knew how i felt about him i didn't have to tell him nobody had to tell him he knew how i felt about him he said some terrible things he said some horrible things about the jews he said many things that were wrong that are in error that are not the truth and yet he was still the church age messenger i'm not trying to draw any i'm just telling you didn't get it all right but he got just shall live by faith right john wesley was a trinitarian he didn't get the godhead right he didn't get the baptism right but he got the washing of the water by the word through sanctification he got that right so we had to have a messenger who would come in the last days who would tie together all the loose sins left over by the other messages in fact he said when that seventh angel comes he will not have a message of his own we're always talking about brother branham's message but he said that messenger will have no message of his own it'll just be to tie together all the loose sins to to eliminate all the excuses of what we didn't see and what we didn't hear and what we didn't know so that we could be fully accountable to every word of god this laodicean bride coming out she is accountable for every word of god we're not under the cloak under the fog of of half truths like all the other church ages were because here's a man preaching one day that just shall live by faith and the trinity of god the next day here was a man like wesley preaching sanctification one day baptizing entitles the next the most wonderful thing about these church-age messengers is that they were able to hold their head above the fanaticism that surrounded their message that's how brother branham was able to come out strong and say if you say that jesus christ lives in me i pray that you are right but if you're making me him if you're putting me there in that place you are making me antichrist you're not jesus christ you're mrs jesus christ but you came from christ and i'll show you a little bit later and you're going right back to where you come from isn't that a comforting thought see martin luther could not express the attributes that we express because that was in the beginning the resurrection like the corn of wheat that went into the earth he's talking about that re we could say really we could call it re-restoration because because it was a restoration of truth lost during the dark ages that came right in in the middle of the church ages so now we got to build back up we once had it right we lost it now we got to build it back up and god sent a luther to put things back in proper balance concerning justification and he raised up a wesley to place things right right back in proper order concerning sanctification and then there was a pentecostal age i believe it was clarence larkin who said that the laodicean church age began in uh 1900 and brother branham oh brother branham was the one that put it back to 1900. can we get that can someone look that for me brother branham put it in 1906 that's what i thought larkin put it at 1900. there are only two variations in what larkin said about the dates of the church ages and what brother branham said about the church ages and that's one of them he placed it at 1906 because that was the beginning of the azusa street revival he believed that that being the birthday of the modern church the modern pentecostal church that was the beginning of the last church age and if you hear him talking about the purpose listen carefully if you hear him talking about the purpose of this restoration he tells us right what it was for it was to put healing back it was to put the holy ghost back laodicea laodicea that's that's a church age you identify with correct i mean i'm living in a bright age over here at the end of laodicea that's what the word tells us but we most identify with laodicea as a church age he said and it was also for the restoration you know what i'm gonna say you know of the gifts isn't it amazing that god would go to so much trouble to put back in the church what the enemy had stolen away only to let the message preachers come around now and take away from us what laodicea restored i don't think people even know the church age i don't even think some of those that walk around with a church age book under their arm like it's a bible or something i don't think they even realize what the church ages are about because if you did you would understand that that it was a restoration of the original pentecost don't come around here at the end of the age and tell us that we now no longer need the gifts we no longer need the holy ghost when it took seven church ages to put it back in you think the bride is going to let you take it away from us now never sure there must be a proper order sure it must fulfill its biblical purpose but we can't let you take away from us what it took seven church ages to give us back [Applause] maybe we need to look at some of those quotes but not this morning martin luther could not express the attributes that we express because that was in the beginning now let's go to modern events are made clear by prophecy san bernardino california paragraph 118 and so will the church come through justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost check that quote someone check that one for me check it on your phone make sure i didn't add that okay good thank you very much that's just what it said we didn't highlight it because we don't want to emphasize it any more than we emphasize anything else we thought the other needed to be emphasized but we want to make sure it's supposed to be there justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost restoration of gifts right on into the formed image of christ which is justification sanctification baptism the holy ghost restoration of the gifts right into christ remember what the man said to brother branham about the scaffold work he just called these things the scaffold work brother graham said here but you need to know this you don't take the scaffold work down until the building has been perfectly completed you got to have it you got to have it you got to have it i want you to know i believe the gifts will be manifesting as the bride is leaving making her exit jesus not speaking in tongues the prophet said that god will too [Music] i'm just quoting i i mean i added a little bit there the bride will too but brother braham said jesus died speaking in tongues now i want you to pray for me because sometime it could be as soon as next sunday but i next sunday is the 31st so it'll most likely be the seventh but some time soon i'm going to begin a series on tongues diverse tongues speaking in tongues and messages in tongues because they're all the same so we're going to talk about that and people have been waiting for it anticipating it coming and and i'm almost ready to start it i don't have all my notes together but i'm almost ready to start it i'm ashamed to tell you i've been working on it two years maybe longer maybe three just gathering the balance see because if i'm going to read you the quotes where brother branham talks about speaking in tongues being like peas on a on a dry peas on a cowhide those are the ones that people love so much when they're taking tongues out i'm going to read them but i'm going to read the other ones too where he said that's the only kind that's the only kind the word gives birth to that kind of baby now that's just recently some powerful things that i was able to find that i think will help us so perhaps by the first sunday of august since i just realized we have one more week in july i may can do that i think some of you will appreciate that study pretty pretty good uh let's go on christ let me just start and read it over again so we can flow and so will the church come through justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost restoration of gifts right on into the formed image of christ christ is the bridegroom the church is the bride and the bride is a part of the bridegroom it'll have to be a word church now that takes out the creeds that takes out the not a denominational church it'll be the word church the word that's made known and by the vindicated word of god how many of you are thankful for the message of this hour now in the message christ is the mystery of god revealed i know it's a little different got a lot of quotes stay with me paragraph 184 predestinated there's the mystery he before christ or anything else was ever on earth you see his great mystery somebody read that for me the great mystery is that he chose the bride knowing eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall hallelujah how is it that she will not fall she will hold to that word regardless of what all the rest of the world has to say about it here we are holding on to the word no matter what the world or the church world has to say about it we're holding on isn't that good they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there then he defines that by saying the adoption of children by jesus christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand now what is that great glorious stand it's to stand on the word someone read ephesians 1 we don't have it we didn't pull it up but someone get ephesians 1 verse 3 and 4 you have it elias let me hand you the microphone read that for us just a moment let's see the mute comes off yes read that for us please one verse three and four blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love amen just what we read at the beginning amen but now just three and four thank you so much brother branham is saying predestinated the church to that great glorious stand and we've just defined the stand by having our brother read it he said now you see his secret watch what to to restore fallen eve i'm not sure you're with me will you get there as she was a prefigure of the church and now notice as god opened up the side of adam and took out eve by his own flesh and blood and divided his spirit from masculine and feminish to feminish and put it in eve now notice he reached into adam took from his spirit part of that spirit god's spirit in adam was male part of it was female feminist god divided that spirit from male here to remain in adam and the feminist he placed in eve he put it in eve let's read on so powerful took the rib from under his side and made eve out of it so did the same thing listen taking out of the side of christ the blood and the water and christ is the word and taking the word and making up his church eve see back to himself again redeemed by the blood that must come from his body oh that's powerful that's powerful now let's go on christ is the mystery of god revealed same message paragraph 384 but the eve in the last day is not going to do it she's not going to misbelieve she's not going to take human reasoning the eve in the last day is not going to do it how do we know because she predestinated not to do it that's the bride yes sir god's going to do it he knows he'll have it he said church would be there without his church would be there without spot or wrinkle now look she is going to stand there in the splendor of him [Music] and what is she going to be i am a word sent from god his word made manifest my i can show you where brother branham said just like the word put on flesh in the day of jesus the word is putting on flesh in the last day powerful isn't it no wonder it's called a bride coming of christ are you with me don't miss this i know for some of you it's a little bit different but look at 385 just one just one little quote just one sentence it'll shake the whole world shield the rod she'll be a token [Music] to the world why were you born to be a token to the world somebody has to display who jesus is somebody has to be a living attribute of god somebody has to be the living word for this hour she'll be a token to the world in the message identification you're keeping up quite well uh paragraph 55 it's just a little short one i like it he said the whole thing is god becoming material like a husband and wife becoming one together god and his church becoming one i am a word i am a word i am a word sent from god i am a word sent from god say it again i am a word sin from god we've got a lot more to go through are you still here good in the message the identification of christ in all ages preached in birmingham alabama the prophet said it's god manifested in flesh now now in the flesh i'm a word sent from god i am a word sin from god i'm a word sin from god i'm a word sin from god it's god men of now you want to come along and tell me that you're going to have to struggle with lust the rest of your life you're going to have to struggle with jealousy the rest of your life you're going to have to struggle with pornography the rest of your life and you're here to be god manifested in flesh no he was tempted in all manner even as we are yet without sin to show you and i that it's possible and that there will be a word bride in the last days who walk above it not in our own strength and power but by the revelation of who we are a word sent from god i got a lot more it's god manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the same self do you know who i am i'm flesh of his flesh i'm born of his bone i am a living attribute of a living god i am a thought expressed i'm an attribute that has been expressed i am a word sent from god now this is powerful for us to get a hold of now uh i want to go to christ it's identified let me just make sure that i didn't use that one already because i i went back and pulled some i don't think i did did this one christ is identified the same in all generations are you still here thank you so much paragraph 71 he's eternal and he's the only source of eternal life there is it's in god our father he's eternal himself now therefore if we have eternal life i want to ask you how many of you in this room you're not ashamed to say that you believe that you have eternal life so now if you have eternal life we have part of god in us and god in us if you have eternal life the only eternal life is the life of god he's the only source brother branham tells us if it was created it has a beginning and it has an end only god being eternal and whoever he imparts his spirit to they are eternal unless god should impart his spirit he didn't feel that satan with the holy ghost lucifer didn't have the holy ghost lucifer is not eternal anybody with me the soul that sinneth is not eternal because it has not had the life of god imparted into it he said now therefore if we have eternal life we have part of god in us and god in us if he isn't then that's the only way you could have eternal life is to have god living inside of you he said it isn't something that was manufactured then given to you by some creed or you lived into it you grew into a better man or a better woman that seems to be the gospel of the church today just be the best uh uh best you you can be the best version of yourself well being the best version of myself could not produce what the word has produced in me the eternal life of god he said not not that you grew into a better man or a better woman it's god himself in you be careful where you take him be careful watch what you what you get him involved in he said just like you're a part of your father here on earth you're a part of your heavenly father can you see that and he said and what you are you're the attribute of his thoughts of you before the foundation of the world right now you are you are what he thought you would be somebody said oh god have mercy he thought i would be yeah he thought i would struggle like this yes he knew that he knew that but that's not all he knew about you i'll show you this in a minute i found some things here that really bless my blesser he said listen to this he said uh and what you are you're the attribute of his thoughts of you before the foundation of the world you're expressed he had to breed it in very interesting now that's just what i said to you last sunday your mom and your dad came together and they and they and they uh they certainly produced a part of who you are he had to breed it in but he was the one who chose where to put that spirit in everything he said to get what you are to make you what you are i appreciated someone writing me this week and saying i finally got it i finally got who i am in my family and why god placed me in the family he placed me in i now realize why i'm in the family that i was in that good when somebody can see that finally and then you quit questioning god why did you give me to this family why did you place me here when you knew things were going to be hard and harsh and awful and and life was not going to be good why did you you you just begin to realize he placed you there as a token he placed you there as a solitaire all right now let's go on future home i'm going to read now several quotations from the future home notice this is 64. he said if you've got eternal life there's only one form that's god and you are an expressed attribute i am a word sent from god so this is for the person who said to me some years ago when i preached i'm a word sin from god i'm uncomfortable with the fact that you're making me equal to a word of god or the word of god well here here is the answers for all of that you you were in the same mind that the healer was in and the savior and the deliverer all that god needed to express you were in that same mind you were a thought just like all the rest you were an attribute just like all the rest remember when brother branham is talking about the woman at the well uh uh or the woman caught in the act of adultery excuse me and corrected it when he is talking about the woman caught in the act of adultery he places her attributes below no he places her attributes above he places the attributes of the pharisees below dot not not nod he said he said thereof their father the devil didn't he but this little woman caught in the very act of adultery she was represented above caught in the act of adultery i'm getting that right arna it it was the woman caught an act of adultery not the woman at the well caught in the act of adultery and yet she had representation in the mind of god these religious fanatics their representation did not come from the mind of god it came from another father altogether interesting isn't it so even when you were out there in sin and even when you were doing things that you had no business doing you were still represented in the mind of god because that was where your origin was oh amazing grace how sweet to sound he said you're not going to uh uh you you are an expressed attitude if you're not you're not going to be there anyhow no man can come to me except my father has drawed him he only draws his own just telling what the word said see which passes away all these old things but these things don't so it speaks of eternity the holy ghost is eternal now now what look at the next sentence then you are in eternity where you was all the time but you've just recognized what happened [Music] paragraph 238 see you were made for an eternal purpose why were you born you were made for an eternal purpose to be a token of the world to express the spoken word of the father as a word sent from god are you following me that's who you are that's why you're here that's your why i don't have permission to share this so i'm not going to share it because you're watching i'm not going to share your name but i want you to i want you to listen to this young man somebody i love very much before genesis 1 1 i was a thought in the mind of god his spirit covered the earth brooding over his precious seed nothing happened until he spoke it when the time came for his thought of me to become word he spoke my name hallelujah i gave my heart to the lord when i was younger at ohio youth camp and was baptized long story short with my father issues and things that happened in my family i turned to the world even when i was snorting cocaine even when i was drunk out of my mind even when i was with more women i could name he never left me brother shelly i felt him through all of it i hope i don't get in trouble for sharing this never at any time did he leave me or forsake me he was not happy with me but he was there with me he was a thought in my mind constantly pulling at me watching over me i know it because i felt him and i continued living a life for myself but one day i had enough he wasn't just the thought in my head anymore i spoke it and told him i didn't want that life anymore i wanted him if he dresses the lilies with beauty and splendor how much more does he love me he watches over me he watches over every sparrow how much more does he love me thank you for teaching scripture and all your hard work and dedication who would want to dance getting a testimony like that he got it he got it he got it see you were made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in god that thought of you and expressed you and he made earth see you thought the earth was the important part but the prophet said no you were. you remember the little clip we we made hawkmaid it's all about the bride you were he made an earth that he could take you out of and to make you a human being you had to have an expression you had to have a place to express yourself you had to play you had to have a place to come and show the world who you are a word sent from god so he created an earth and placed you in the earth you were the more valuable of the two the bible said so jesus tells us that a soul is more valuable 10 million worlds like the one we're living in right now laid at our feet and it could not buy a soul isn't that good and sin come along and perverted his way that was okay because god had that handle too if you believe that say amen all right where are we a little more you come anyhow but you was lost with the world so he come and redeemed you now here's who you are the expressed attribute and also redeems this earth by the same way i got to read that again you need to listen to this he said you come anyhow but you was lost with the world so he come and redeems you the expressed attribute and also redeems the earth by the same way then his purpose rolls on see oh hallelujah oh that does me so much good think of just what lays ahead if you can think about what lays ahead you ought to give god a praise the whole redemption [Applause] i want you to look at what messenger comes from the future home the future home paragraph 275 of the same message he said just like all the curse of sin is gone you got to hear this just like all the curse of sin is gone when the holy ghost accepts you see you don't accept it it accepts you remember what ephesians said you are accepted in the beloved all the curse of sin is gone when the holy ghost accepts you see you don't accept it it accepts you see because it's god's attribute see if it's the holy ghost it means god's spirit and it's the attribute the thought of god has accepted you because that you were ordained for that purpose remember the prophet said it was in him to be father it was in him to be son it was in him to be holy ghost attribute it was also in him to express himself as reed gabrielson west of greeley stephen shaw david yantis you sisters are not to be left out he said yet you was born in sin imagine that you were a living attribute of god sent forth into the earth word made flesh thought expressed and yet you were born in sin but god had that attribute and here you expressed yourself here on the earth and he comes down and gets you one day the holy spirit passes over the top of the water and says your mind your mind your mind your mind he starts claiming what belongs to him he's going to have his seed you hear me jesus christ is going to have his seed all that the father hath given him every one of them will come no man will be able to take them out of my hand why because they're his seed [Applause] the prophet of the old testament said he will see his seed and there he hung suspended between heaven and earth how was he able to endure the suffering of the cross because he saw his seed you wasn't nails that kept him there it was you he saw you and that's what kept him on the cross he knew me yet he loved me he whose glory makes the heaven shine so unworthy of such mercy yet when he was on the cross i was on his mind the look of love was on his face the thorns were on his head blood was on his scarlet robe was stained a crimson red and though his eyes were on the crowd that day he looked ahead in time for when he was on the cross was on his mind he saw his seed yet he knew me yet he loved me he whose glory makes the heaven shine so on worthy of such [Music] yet when he was on the cross ah 275 just like all the curse of sin is gone when the holy ghost accepts you future home where we were see you don't accept it it accepts you see because it's god's attribute i'm at the beginning the thought of god has accepted you because that you were ordained for that purpose see in that powerful you yet you was born in sin there we are but god had that attribute and here you expressed yourself on earth and he comes down and gets you see you back here you're back here here is where you belong see sin has lost its power that's right the desire of sin has done gone from your heart when the holy spirit comes in you are a restored person i want to praise god for that he's coming to claim you he's coming to claim you now go to paragraph 551 same message then in obedience to this commandment in obedience to the word of god which cannot fall or fail oh this is you got to hear this it's a little bonus i threw this in as a bonus then in obedience to this commandment in obedience to the word of god which cannot fail we as your delegates from 1500 miles square like the city we say to satan the defeated devil your end is to be burned we are the delegation from the city that's foursquare amen you know what that means a delegation is sent out

mansion over there and when free from toil and care i am going where the lamb is the light in that city where the lamb is the light in that city where there cometh no night i have a mansion over there and went free from toil and care i am going where the lamb is here we have our disappointments yet we know all the why go and our fondest hopes but meet with bitter blight though by night we weep the morning brings a smile in that city sing it out in that city where in that city where they're coming oh i've a mansion over there and went free from toil and care i am going where the lamb is the life delegates delegates from the city foursquare delegates from a city 1500 mile square he said we are the delegation from the city that's four square the city where the lamb is the light we are the expressed attribute of god almighty who jesus christ has read who are you why were you born we are the express attribute of god almighty who jesus christ has redeemed how by his grace isn't that good see now listen to this he goes into prayer satan come out leave every sick person that's in here in the name of jesus christ holy hands that's been redeemed because they believe the word and are attributes of god's thought now them hands is upon each other you cannot hold them any longer come out in the name of jesus christ in the powerful [Applause] i'm not just tom dick or harry i am a living attribute of a living god a word sent from god i'm the just some church member he thought of me he smoked me he sent me [Applause] he made a world for me to live on even though sin perverted my life he made a way to take me back all the way back to his original thoughts about me i want to give you a definition of deliverance deliverance is being taken back to god's original thoughts concerning you that's deliverance when you get back to living the life that god ordained for you to live over here you can say i found my total deliverance until then we're still pushing still pulling still praying still believing a few more the god who is rich in mercy you ought to be with me during the week when i'm finding these i don't have time for much else it don't leave a lot of extra time because i'm looking for something sometimes i don't know what i'm looking for paragraph 44. now we are a part of god you always was oh this is a good one you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in god follow this you were only in his thinking watch this your very name if it ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he's talking about the lamb's book he knew what you were are you all just acting like that's good because you're trying to be good to me nice to meet you we should be my brother we should be my brother and we ought to be unoffendable just simply because of who we are i'm an overcomer you were only in this thinking your very name if it ever was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were let's go on i'm only saying that not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare how many of you have sat through those scary altar calls anybody ever give them i have i beat on the wall i've ran over to the wall when i was a boy and beat on the wall and made it sound like those people and was in the flood beating on the ark to get in if we only knew if we only knew that none of that was really necessary fear won't bring you to grace fear won't cause you to manifest who you are only god only god only love he'll tell you in a minute only love only him expressing himself as love can do that for you love can do way more than fear can accomplish if you believe that same man he said i i just want he said i'm not only saying this now i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare he said you don't know who you are you are not going to be but now you are the sons of god isn't that what the scripture said he said see you always were the sons of god see that doesn't mean there didn't need to be repentance in baptism in the name of jesus and the reef in the baptism of the holy ghost he's not saying any of those things he's saying all of these things are made available to you because god saw you in the beginning all right are we still together all right then the next paragraph paragraph 46 he said same same message the god who was rich in mercy did we miss one all right paragraph 46 was there also let me read it to you we don't have it but let me read it to you for when god had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before there he said well when when before he even become material here on earth that's god before god became material here on earth before there was anything but god before there was anything but god you were one of his attributes listen to this he knowed what your name would be he knowed the color of your hair you would have he knowed all about you how could he do that because he'd already thought about you you're exactly what he thought you to be now in the message lean not unto thine own understanding do you have that paragraph 17 should be the next one in line lean not under thine owner's understanding that's it he said so you see if you were in the foreknowledge of god then you are becoming a part of god and the only way you can be a son of god or a daughter of god you had to be a part of god and god isn't complete he's gathering all of his thoughts back together and god isn't complete without you powerful has to be that's right because there is one only one resource of eternal life and that is god and him alone has eternal life see now and you were a part of him in so much that you're an attribute or in his thinking in the beginning it and listen that it gives that little tug towards him that's what has to be quickened some of them will never be quick and they just don't have it that's all you see only an attribute an expression of god in the earth are you with me only an expression of god in the earth a thought or an attribute expressed in the earth has that god tug and that's what the quickening spirit falls on it's the gene it's the gene it's the gene of the seed it's the gene seed life of god and the anointing and the quickening power falls on that and you start feeling the tug here was a young man who said he was with me i could feel him i knew he was there even just a thought in my mind but i knew he was there all the time what a revelation everybody doesn't have that now in the message the easter seal i would love to get all these in but i won't because i just won't paragraph 59 he said there's only one life one eternal spirit one eternal life and that's god god alone is the eternal and then we being his children are part of him that is the attributes of his thinking and the thought is expressed and becomes there you are there's your quote i need a quote where brother branham said i'm a word sent from god there it is go back and then we being his children are part of him that is the attributes of his thinking and the thought is expressed and becomes a word not just anybody's word god's mind god's thought god's attributes god's word all right let's go on then each individual is here that possesses this eternal life was before the foundation of the world in god's thinking it's the only way it could be because you're an attribute that's an expression of a thought has become a word and a word has taken life hallelujah a word has taken life and what did he say about it it's eternal it's eternal all right let's go on that's the reason we have eternal life in the same principle that the great son of god the redeemer we become sons and daughters of god through that same spirit by the same foreknowledge of god are you still here and give me just a minute let me find something to mark i'm gonna read one more maybe two could be three this is a good one are any of them not good no not really i want you to notice that most of these that have come in here are 64-65 that's simply because i started with the last sermon that this appeared in and went backwards that don't mean he didn't say it all through he said it all through but as his understanding and revelation expanded we often see that taking place in those last years after the seals were loosed he said the bible became a new book and and very little doctrinally changed but there were some things definitely expanded after the full revelation came i want to take you to a message called the power of transformation prescott arizona october 31st 1965. i want to go to paragraph 293. if you are a christian now a genuine predestinated seed you was in god you always was in god the germ of your life which is an attribute of god which was his thought now he's going to give you an example that i find very very helpful in the next paragraph so let's go on watch this carefully if you're a little bit confused or not quite settled i want you to hear how it works this is this was precious he did this twice that i know of could be many more times but two times i found something very similar to this now stay with me you're ahead of me don't read ahead of me stay where i am say for instance this pretty little lady sitting here see god said in the day there will be a girl her name will be so-and-so she will be this thus and this stop period look at me she'll be that tall of a medium build red hair we don't know she will be this thus and this and even and even no to this very hour she would sit and listen at this message dressed in a red dress is that getting any clearer for you some people think this is just broad you know god knew me this is pretty specific he knew where she was coming he knew what her name would be knew what color hair she would have knew all there was to know about her he said earlier now he knows she's going to be sitting here today listening to this sermon he said and wearing a red dress that's pretty specific isn't it see that was his thought so in eternity pass she was sitting in a service in a red dress certain color hair certain build certain personality and disposition in the mind of god before the foundation of the world he goes on whoever your husband is and whoever he is and he would bring this together god so before the foundation of the world what business do you have choosing your own companion what business does anybody have choosing their own mate in life and then expecting god to make the best of it why don't you wait on the lord and don't bring me no uh i know it's god because he hasn't stopped me or i know it's god because he hadn't told me it wasn't this is look you're a living attribute of god you don't have to be led by by by uh what do you call that deductive reasoning you don't have to be led by by uh what do they call it when you take out your options process of elimination thank you you don't have to know god's mind by process of elimination you're a living attribute of god you can wait for more than that you can come before the presence of the lord and ask him his will and expect him to show you his will is that right if he knew in eternity pass it a woman to be sitting here this morning to hear the word in a red dress with certain building i already knew who her husband was he already had a plan and he would bring this together and you would sit here this in this city at this day there could be no way for you to fail it because you're growing let's redone let's go on and as long as your seed inside growing you have to produce just exactly what the seed said you would do unbelief will pull you out of god's predestinated plan for your life and either plunge you in your own rebellion or in the permissive will of god which brings different results the permissive will of god will bring different results in your life than the perfect will of god and yes brother branham taught both god has a perfect plan one he saw before the foundation of the world does he always force you to do it if you read this quote you might come away with an idea that god will force you but i'm telling you he does not force us but what he will do sometime is let us find ourselves out there and i have quotes for that too and he woos and pulls and draws us right back to his plan now here's the key in this quote as long as your seed inside growing you take yourself out from under the living word you'll stop growing you get yourself out from under the anointing of the holy spirit in the presence of jesus christ and you quit growing and you'll start making your own dumb choices say amen but as long as you sit under the anointed word and you come into the presence of god on a regular basis praising him and worshiping him and creating an atmosphere for him to gently lead you along you'll never step away from his plan it's his word he keeps his word he watches over it just like he did in the beginning see he said you was in your father as a germ and you come forth as a daughter you you every one of you brothers and sisters you come forth if you wasn't in your father then you wouldn't have been here we understand this by the seed don't we and if you wasn't in god if you believe the message of the bible and the present message of the day a vindication of it the reason you are sitting here listen now listen listen now the reason you are sitting here because you were predestinated to sit here now you come along and tell me you denominational nut case you come along and tell me god don't care where you go church that's the same way they say god don't care how you baptize as long as you believe in him no sir you don't understand you don't understand it all he already has a plan for our life and it doesn't include just happenstance it's not luck that we're living by it's a divine program of god and he said you're sitting here because you were predestinated to sit here you wouldn't have been here otherwise listen to what brother branham's saying not only about the woman in the red dress but all of us he said you wouldn't have been here otherwise you'd have been on the street maybe drunk some of you i know nobody in this church is going to rise up with some self-righteousness and say i can assure you i wouldn't be you have no idea i have no idea where i'd be i know what i think i would choose i know what i think i would reject but the truth of the matter is i don't know what i where i would be or what shape i would be in had it not been for finding a grace to yield to the predestinated plan of god for my life come on come on come on come on i'm like some of you i wouldn't be living in alabama that's for sure and some of you out here running around with some other man's wife and you women out married running around with some other woman's husband or something like that see but you were predestinated to be here listen to this see you can't help it your family comes to see why do you always have to go to church you just leave me here said you always have to go to church why do you always have to go to church why are you always listening to preaching i can't help it can't help it i have a father i have a father he is god you were a seed anybody there he's still preaching and when he come to a place he's got you now to where you was in him then as a thought here it is this is it why did you have to be transferred from the mind of god as a thought attribute to a body of flesh and placed on an earth he built an earth for you to live on by the way we we found that just a moment ago you're reading ahead you're reading ahead when i already heard him rejoicing me too now you are a person that can do what say it together fellowship he wanted you to be more than a thought in his head he wanted you to be more than a word coming out of his mouth he wanted you to have a physical form and god almighty wanted to have fellowship with you with you see like you was in your father's at the beginning but now uh you are sons and daughters let's read on so you can have fellowship with your parent now we're sons and daughters of god who can fellowship with our father god see it's just as beautiful aren't you thankful don't you like that then you become like him and if we were sons then your attributes and was in his form at the beginning and remember if you was in him at the beginning and when jesus which is god the word made flesh and dwelt among us then you were in him and stood the insults that he took listen you went to calvary with him in him you died in him you arose and now you are seated together in the heavenly places where in him two more modern events are made clear by prophecy 172 did we read that in the other batch we did have one from that sermon didn't we is that the same one all right no that was 118 this is 172. all right let's read it 172. are you still with me i know you're tired i am but the real ordained of god that real gene that real germ [Music] a soul of god that was in god before the foundation of the world remember you that's really got the spirit of god in you tonight you were here in christ because he was the fullness of the word he was the fullness of the godhead bodily you remember all that the father was he poured into the sun let's go on god was in christ reconciling the world to himself do you believe that he said look he was in christ then if you were in god a gene a word an attribute from the beginning then you walked with him here on earth anybody listening you talked with him on earth you suffered with him on earth you died with him at calvary and you wrote make sure you you don't miss this and you rose with him again and now you're setting in heavenly places in christ jesus communing with him the word as it feeds into your soul that man shall live by every word that proceedeth forth from the mouth of god now i want you to hear this this is the climax and i'm leaving things out to get to the climax this quote for me as a climax this is paragraph 152 of questions and answers august the 23rd of 64. and uh take it down please because uh some of these will be already ready they'll already be burping before we start eating did i just say that they will some of these over here they'll be done digesting it and burping it before we get to eating it that's why you burp to make room for more i isaiah 55 11 put that up here because i want to make sure thank god i got to it today before sister joyce could it's from last week it may take you a minute to find it i'd say 55 11. i want we come in here today and no paper in the printer if you print something please put a piece of paper back if you don't find any buy some [Music] couldn't find any paper went down to the office it was 80 degrees by the thermostat at the office the air wasn't on don't know how it got turned off i didn't turn it off somebody did 80 degrees i started dripping when i went in the door that early in the morning started dripping when i went in the door could not find you imagine what it smelled like in there at 80 degrees could not find any paper to print my wife had to bring paper from home to print everything everything out of sorts and then these young people come in my office to pray and i i just saw oh my what does it matter mariah afraid that she wouldn't get to all the quotes i had nine pages to add today and afraid you wouldn't all these things that wear on you and weigh on you and god is good all the time we ought not to even let it disturb our peace he's got it so shall my word be so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it was in him to be a healer is he a healer in him to be a deliverer have you found him to be a deliverer a savior a counselor then why would we believe that any of his thoughts will not accomplish everything that he saw them accomplishing he said so shall my word be that goeth out of my mouth it didn't start in his mouth it started in his mind as a thought and an attribute his mouth brought it into creation it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please ephesians according to his pleasure and it shall prosper in the thing 2022 where to i sent it i'm telling you that's one of the most powerful verses in the old testament in this context now i want to read that quote questions and answers number one 1964 paragraph 152 let me let me rush and read it before you can when jesus suffered in that body he suffered because a man and a woman are one person stay with me eve was taken out of adam and the church what happened god opened up the side of adam now brother branham was a man and he could make mistakes because all men could make mistakes if that makes you nervous it shouldn't because he told us to keep our balance he told brother the green over and over again whatever you do brother keep your balance in the scriptures and you'll never be able to balance the quotes if you can't lay them in the scriptures and one time brother brandon makes a statement that a woman that a man has a one less rib than a woman that is not the case i just want you to know that it doesn't change who he was or what he was or the ministry that god gave him it just means that he had a thought you all see the water coming down i'm assuming it's dripping out of there see the wet spots i almost forgot what i was doing god opened up the side of adam and took out of there a help meet a helpmate the bride and god opened up the sight of jesus at calvary and took out the bride you remember standing me standing here on a flatbed trailer in a parking lot of gravel right here and preaching for the first time at christ the bride was taken out of christ through a narrow way and that the bride would enter in to christ he would come back into christ through a narrow way it was a spear thrust in his side that separated the bride from christ and it would be a narrow place we wouldn't come a broad way we would come a narrow way to get back to where we came from but god would get us there and he is he's getting us there and god opened up the sight of jesus at calvary and took out the bride and when jesus died at calvary remember the bride was not taken from the body until the body was dead why because you had to die in him because his death is your death do you remember what a struggle we had in this church for over a year when i was preaching that and everybody was on the struggle bus maybe not everybody but a lot of folks and it would be so hard to break through those scriptures and so hard to break through those truths because we find it so difficult to believe that his death was our death but here brother branham explains to us the bride was not separated from the body until now i know that i know some children are loud don't even let that bother you it don't bother me it's not bothering me don't let that bother you i know some of you are worried especially if you think it's one of yours don't don't worry about it it's all right they're just expressing who they are children we get you under the anointing and you scream and carry on like that too expressing who you are so right now that is not bothering me but you're bothering me because you're worried about it don't worry about it it's all right remember the bride was not taken from the body until the body was dead he had already died and they was going to break his legs and the prophet said there'll not be one bone broken let's go on so they done drawed back the hammer to break a leg and a man went up with a spear and pushed it through his side brother branham said through his heart and the reason for that is because the explanation of blood and water comes from an exploded heart but the reality is the spear would have never had to go through his heart perhaps it did just like he said but because if the heart explodes then that that sack that pericardium where the blood is where the fluid is that protects the heart that's like water it's not blood it's like water and you don't ever know you got one until something goes wrong with it but i want you to know it's some of the worst pain i ever had in my life was pericarditis when an infection in my body turned into an inflammation and infection of the sac that the heart is in and i'm telling you that was pain and that that heart was under such a load that it exploded and when it did it burst the pericardium and the blood that was pumping through the heart and the water the sack of water in the sack of protection of the heart it exploded and and regardless of whether that went right through his heart or if it went through his side as we read then it wouldn't matter because that both blood and water came running out that spearhole he said and water and blood come forth he was already dead already dead there are so many places where brother adam talks about the bride being the water that came out of his heart he said she was already redeemed in the body by his death so for those of you who want to go through the tribulation so bad be my guest but here's what the word said so there's no more suffering tribulation period for the bride why because she died in him she paid the price in him she proved her love in him he said see she does what she goes in i want you to give god a handclap of praise [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] i am a word sent from god a thought an attribute expressed are you with me let's stand together oh hallelujah i know that was a lot of reading but i find it necessary it thank you thank you it's him it's that wasn't me it's his word it's life-giving i don't know how in the world people are so satisfied with everything else but they cannot feast on his word see you you have to be a part of that word to fully understand what happens when that word comes forth like that it's your story being told and you start identifying with that if i would have went on in that message it's where he starts talking about paul revere and it's where he starts saying i rode with general washington and i rode with paul revere and i was i'm identified in her strengths and i'm identified with this nation in her weaknesses because i'm in her i was in her i'm a part of that and he starts contrasting that with who we are in the bride i'm telling you it's wonderful to know these things it's wonderful to know that i don't know did they have did anybody have a worship did they uh plan a song did ben leave somebody with a song josh did you have a song you already have one come on let's have the musicians to come if they're here let's worship a little bit it's already two o'clock how did it get to be two o'clock i thought i was giving a quick discourse yes it does flies when you're having fun and i was having fun hallelujah praise the lord praise the
