[1:06:44] [Music]
[1:06:58] yes it is
[1:07:02] [Music]
[1:07:05] let's say that just again
[1:07:08] didn't see
[1:07:10] my soul
[1:07:14] my sin your God to the
[1:07:20] [Music]
[1:07:24] our Grace
[1:07:26] down
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:37] [Music]
[1:07:46] [Music]
[1:08:01] I agree
[1:08:03] [Music]
[1:08:07] I just had to sing that
[1:08:11] I've been praying and just praying
[1:08:14] that God would have his way
[1:08:18] I remember the time
[1:08:21] when the prophet of God was in Mexico
[1:08:25] and this little Woman's baby died
[1:08:30] and the man of God told someone else to
[1:08:33] go pray
[1:08:35] trying to keep order
[1:08:37] then all of a sudden
[1:08:40] he had a vision
[1:08:42] and he saw that little Mexican baby in
[1:08:45] mid-air laughing at him
[1:08:47] you see what I'm saying
[1:08:48] what God when God wants to change the
[1:08:52] Order of Things
[1:08:54] we change with God
[1:08:58] and what I've been praying for God has
[1:09:01] is just his presence
[1:09:04] I don't think people realize it's More
[1:09:07] Than A Feeling
[1:09:09] it's absolutely the pill of fire god in
[1:09:13] the place and sometimes we we can miss
[1:09:17] our blessings
[1:09:19] because the devil
[1:09:21] will always have you skeptical
[1:09:26] but when that Spirit comes you're
[1:09:30] supposed to move with haste
[1:09:32] into the anointing of God
[1:09:35] don't leave these meetings without your
[1:09:38] Victory
[1:09:40] because he's here
[1:09:42] brother Brooks can't do one thing for
[1:09:45] you
[1:09:45] Hallelujah no minister of God can do a
[1:09:48] thing for you
[1:09:50] and with all the preaching we preach to
[1:09:55] get that kind of anointing
[1:09:57] in the place
[1:09:59] and we want to always let God hallelujah
[1:10:02] have his way
[1:10:05] hey
[1:10:07] those of you
[1:10:09] who did get prayer prayer for prayed for
[1:10:12] just remember it's not a feeling it's
[1:10:15] about faith
[1:10:18] and if you had enough Faith to come up
[1:10:20] to get prayed for you should take the
[1:10:24] same faith
[1:10:26] and take your victory
[1:10:29] go back to your seat with
[1:10:31] the same faith
[1:10:33] that's what gives you the victory right
[1:10:36] there
[1:10:37] Hallelujah may God help me tonight
[1:10:41] I
[1:10:43] as we stand
[1:10:45] we do thank God for
[1:10:47] my brother Shelley we're getting right
[1:10:50] on into the word people of God
[1:10:52] we ask that you turn with us to First
[1:10:54] Corinthians
[1:10:55] I love Calvary
[1:11:00] I love Calvary I love what he did for me
[1:11:04] and I don't think that a lot of people
[1:11:06] still understand
[1:11:10] what he did for us
[1:11:15] yes amen and we're not just going to
[1:11:18] preach on Calvary but we're going to
[1:11:20] preach on what God Calvary did for us
[1:11:24] we always talk about the lamb taking the
[1:11:27] book
[1:11:28] but the lamb could not have taken the
[1:11:29] book had it not been for Calvary
[1:11:33] Hallelujah
[1:11:35] and why did he go
[1:11:38] as we stand let's let's before I go any
[1:11:40] further let's turn to First Corinthians
[1:11:42] the 15th chapter
[1:11:45] I love this anointing
[1:11:48] we can jump we can shout and all that's
[1:11:50] good maybe we'll get a little bit of
[1:11:52] that in before we leave
[1:11:54] but uh what we want to understand is
[1:11:57] that when the Holy goes when God comes
[1:12:00] in the way he
[1:12:02] it's it's amazing
[1:12:06] because there are so many places you can
[1:12:09] go to
[1:12:11] and not yet feel this anymore
[1:12:14] come on come on
[1:12:17] they have become void
[1:12:19] of the spirit and presence of the Lord
[1:12:22] it is not about the depth the depth of
[1:12:24] the word is all good
[1:12:27] but at the end of the day that word is
[1:12:28] supposed to bring you to him
[1:12:32] Hallelujah
[1:12:33] you love the Lord
[1:12:35] amen First Corinthians
[1:12:38] the 15th chapter
[1:12:42] I am a worshiper of the word
[1:12:48] the word is my God
[1:12:53] and whatever the words say I will bow to
[1:12:55] it
[1:12:56] [Music]
[1:12:57] I will say Amen
[1:13:00] to the word of God
[1:13:03] that's what we
[1:13:05] need to understand
[1:13:07] it was a word in the beginning and it
[1:13:09] must be the word in the ending
[1:13:16] 57th verse verse
[1:13:25] let's start at the fifth and fifth verse
[1:13:26] I love that
[1:13:28] oh death
[1:13:30] where is thy staying
[1:13:32] oh grave where is thy victory
[1:13:38] The Sting of death is sin which is
[1:13:41] unbelief
[1:13:42] and the strength of sin is the law
[1:13:46] but thanks be to God
[1:13:50] which giveth us the victory
[1:13:53] through our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:57] therefore my beloved Brethren listen to
[1:14:01] this
[1:14:01] be
[1:14:04] unmovable
[1:14:06] always abounding
[1:14:09] in the work of the Lord
[1:14:12] for as much as ye know
[1:14:15] that your labor
[1:14:17] is not in vain in the Lord
[1:14:23] amen let's pray
[1:14:25] father
[1:14:27] I thank you once again
[1:14:30] Lord I don't even know how to behave
[1:14:32] myself right now
[1:14:34] thank you for your presence yes
[1:14:37] thank you for what you've done thus far
[1:14:41] Lord we love you Jesus
[1:14:43] and father we pray that you have thine
[1:14:47] own way
[1:14:49] let your words speak to every heart
[1:14:52] don't spare us our feelings amen or
[1:14:56] anything
[1:14:58] we need you tonight
[1:15:01] to take us to another level in you
[1:15:04] be merciful to us oh God
[1:15:07] and we will give you the praise Glory
[1:15:10] and Honor
[1:15:11] expose the darkness in our lives
[1:15:16] and set us free
[1:15:18] in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray
[1:15:22] amen
[1:15:24] you may be seated
[1:15:30] Hallelujah
[1:15:33] God is more than
[1:15:36] able
[1:15:38] hey
[1:15:39] he will do and can do uh exceedingly
[1:15:43] abundantly above
[1:15:49] whatsoever
[1:15:51] we ask or think
[1:15:56] you know I was thinking
[1:16:00] and I've been praying God
[1:16:02] speak to our hearts
[1:16:05] because we need a man to see where we
[1:16:08] air
[1:16:10] we understand perfection
[1:16:13] and the only perfect one is you
[1:16:17] and father we need your perfection
[1:16:21] we need you to destroy the yokes
[1:16:25] and the bondages the things that keep
[1:16:28] holding us back it is not what the
[1:16:31] message is all about
[1:16:33] this whole week has been on Victory
[1:16:38] knowing that we have it
[1:16:41] but it's like a pardon
[1:16:44] a pardon is not a pardon
[1:16:47] except to be accepted
[1:16:49] as a pardon
[1:16:51] and victory is not something you win
[1:16:55] it's something that God has won for you
[1:16:59] but the only way
[1:17:01] comes Victory is that you must accept it
[1:17:05] Hallelujah
[1:17:07] and in every time a victory there's
[1:17:10] always a celebration
[1:17:13] is that right
[1:17:14] when John saw that the lamb had taken
[1:17:18] the book and the lamb was worthy he
[1:17:20] shouted in Victory and this is way I
[1:17:24] believe amen when when the devil tries
[1:17:27] to overtake us we understand he cannot
[1:17:31] because our destiny has already been
[1:17:33] predetermined
[1:17:35] God God because we chose him he chose us
[1:17:43] we don't have to fear anything that the
[1:17:46] devil brings
[1:17:47] I was thinking when Paul preached oh
[1:17:50] death whereas I sting I thought about
[1:17:52] the times that when people die the first
[1:17:55] thing we want to do is call the people
[1:17:57] of the morgue we're going to call the
[1:17:59] the ambulance and stuff like that
[1:18:00] instead the early church
[1:18:03] the early church
[1:18:05] Stood Still
[1:18:07] and they wanted to find out is this the
[1:18:10] will of God
[1:18:12] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:18:14] they wanted to know is this the will of
[1:18:16] God or is Satan playing a trick
[1:18:20] but we are so even now afraid of death
[1:18:27] to when death comes we don't even have
[1:18:29] enough Faith to believe that God can
[1:18:32] resurrect
[1:18:34] help with somebody
[1:18:36] you're going to either believe all of
[1:18:38] the word or don't believe none at all
[1:18:41] it's just like Jesus said and then when
[1:18:44] he said to Mary and Martha if you
[1:18:47] believe me
[1:18:49] you will see the resurrection she says
[1:18:52] Lord we know that the resurrection is
[1:18:55] coming
[1:18:56] but Jesus says no no no no that's not
[1:19:00] the way you should believe
[1:19:02] not coming
[1:19:04] is now
[1:19:07] I am the resurrection I
[1:19:10] I am the life
[1:19:12] Hallelujah and one thing you said well
[1:19:15] oh brother Miss what are you saying let
[1:19:16] me say it like this your Prophet my
[1:19:18] Prophet believe that God could raise the
[1:19:22] Dead
[1:19:23] [Music]
[1:19:25] Hallelujah that's what we taught
[1:19:28] and that's what we need to believe
[1:19:31] [Music]
[1:19:33] we must understand that God has given us
[1:19:35] the victory in everything
[1:19:37] Hallelujah we shouldn't fear nothing
[1:19:40] whatever comes our way we must
[1:19:43] understand oh God give me the victory no
[1:19:46] he has already given you the victory but
[1:19:50] you must accept it
[1:19:52] Hallelujah but you know what we do we
[1:19:55] look at circumstances
[1:19:57] Hallelujah we look at conditions the
[1:20:00] word of God doesn't look at conditions
[1:20:04] Hallelujah Mary mother says Lord Lazarus
[1:20:09] is over there
[1:20:10] he's been dead for days he's stinking
[1:20:14] hallelujah amen how you're going to
[1:20:17] raise that up
[1:20:19] oh somebody help me but Jesus says I am
[1:20:24] the resurrection I am the life if you
[1:20:28] just roll away the stone of unbelief you
[1:20:32] shall see it you shall have be a witness
[1:20:35] that I am the resurrection
[1:20:38] [Applause]
[1:20:40] to this day I don't know how she they
[1:20:42] rolled the stone away
[1:20:44] with one thing for certain about faith
[1:20:47] When Faith is applied there's nothing
[1:20:49] impossible somebody help me here so you
[1:20:53] must realize with the pride of Jesus
[1:20:55] Christ we're born of his bone
[1:20:58] oh we're flush of his flesh
[1:21:01] Hallelujah the same Ministry he had it's
[1:21:05] the same Ministry we have
[1:21:09] okay let down on the word the word is
[1:21:12] God
[1:21:15] when you are a worshiper of the word
[1:21:17] you'll realize the word is God you don't
[1:21:21] speak the word and say well I hope it's
[1:21:22] going to happen the problem with us is
[1:21:25] that we fear
[1:21:27] that God will not keep his promises
[1:21:31] Hallelujah now I don't know about you
[1:21:35] but the prophet of God tells us that
[1:21:37] they're coming a time when limbs will go
[1:21:40] back
[1:21:42] y'all hear me that's the kind and that's
[1:21:45] the way I believe it Hallelujah I know
[1:21:48] it's not by power it's not by my mind
[1:21:51] but it is by his spirit and I do not
[1:21:55] doubt God the word because the word is
[1:21:57] perfect
[1:21:59] and if it says it's possible it's
[1:22:02] possible
[1:22:04] but yet and still
[1:22:06] we struggle
[1:22:08] with things that we shouldn't
[1:22:10] we are we should be in a place of
[1:22:13] maturity
[1:22:14] hello but the problem is we allowed
[1:22:17] ourselves to be distracted
[1:22:20] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:22:22] even Samson knew amen that what he he
[1:22:26] was ordained for
[1:22:28] and that was to destroy the Philistine
[1:22:31] which was a which was a a church of
[1:22:33] unbelief
[1:22:35] Hallelujah and you and I must understand
[1:22:37] that we have been ordained to manifest
[1:22:41] faith
[1:22:43] to manifest the word in a way of belief
[1:22:47] now you can't be helped if you are
[1:22:50] enjoying your demons
[1:22:52] [Music]
[1:22:54] hello
[1:22:55] that's what's wrong with some Christians
[1:22:58] they're still in Joy they're demons
[1:23:02] Hallelujah but I'm gonna tell you
[1:23:05] something about a demon he will or they
[1:23:07] will destroy your soul
[1:23:10] if you don't destroy it it will destroy
[1:23:14] you
[1:23:15] oh come on somebody when you think about
[1:23:19] where we are we're so close to the
[1:23:22] translation
[1:23:23] but let me tell you something because
[1:23:25] you don't see the majority of the people
[1:23:27] moving into that channel let me tell you
[1:23:30] something God has never left himself
[1:23:32] without a witness
[1:23:36] and because you don't see it in other
[1:23:38] people listen I'm not looking to see it
[1:23:40] in other people I want to see it in me
[1:23:43] Hallelujah I want to know that the
[1:23:45] resurrection is in me because if I
[1:23:48] should go to the Grave I want to know
[1:23:50] that I've got the goods that's going to
[1:23:52] get me up
[1:23:56] Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:23:59] but your problem is
[1:24:01] we have people
[1:24:03] that will set right in church and don't
[1:24:06] know that they are demon anointed by
[1:24:09] demons
[1:24:10] [Music]
[1:24:12] y'all hear what I'm saying
[1:24:14] it's the truth
[1:24:15] you get a people or person that would
[1:24:18] come in the Church of God not everybody
[1:24:20] don't have to act alike but you can tell
[1:24:23] when you have uh uh what you call a
[1:24:26] person that Satan has literally placed
[1:24:29] in the church
[1:24:31] to stop the flow of the anointing I'm
[1:24:35] sure everybody's got them
[1:24:37] Hallelujah they're not willing to get
[1:24:40] into the anointing themselves but
[1:24:43] they're there to stop it
[1:24:45] but they're not aware of it
[1:24:47] they're not aware of it but that's a
[1:24:49] demon as I've heard before that's a no
[1:24:52] worship demon
[1:24:54] a no praise demon Hallelujah but when
[1:24:58] you come into presence of the Lord
[1:25:01] ah you better be careful because he's a
[1:25:04] king
[1:25:05] and when you come into the presence of
[1:25:08] the king it says enter his gates with
[1:25:10] Thanksgiving into his cause with praise
[1:25:13] Hallelujah
[1:25:15] oh it's true
[1:25:18] you find that people
[1:25:21] are so still attracted to the world
[1:25:24] you've got to die
[1:25:26] you got to rot
[1:25:28] if you could only understand what's
[1:25:31] coming your way it's worse than the
[1:25:33] tidal wave you understand me when you
[1:25:37] see the flood of devils that was loosed
[1:25:40] in the in the from the river Euphrates
[1:25:43] and how they're moving into their
[1:25:45] channel to bring an attack on the Bride
[1:25:48] of Jesus Christ in ought to put you in a
[1:25:51] spirit of desperation
[1:25:52] Hallelujah because no flesh will be able
[1:25:56] to stand against these devils
[1:25:58] you say oh brother Brooks I'm standing
[1:26:00] let me tell you something about those
[1:26:01] Devils they are very intellectual
[1:26:05] they're very smart and they're Devils of
[1:26:08] science
[1:26:09] you hear what I'm saying so let me just
[1:26:12] say a few little things before I go any
[1:26:14] further
[1:26:15] when it comes to science we realize hey
[1:26:17] man it was a science who destroyed the
[1:26:19] world in antaluian day is that right and
[1:26:22] as I said the other night it was God who
[1:26:24] saved Mankind from science
[1:26:27] and we're living in a world where they
[1:26:30] worship science even to this day
[1:26:33] understand is good and evil but if
[1:26:36] you're not careful you'll find yourself
[1:26:38] letting science work evil
[1:26:41] rather than good
[1:26:43] Hallelujah you know what I'm saying I
[1:26:47] appreciate the car
[1:26:49] Hallelujah because there was a time we
[1:26:51] had to walk
[1:26:53] but understand if you watch that science
[1:26:56] you better be careful
[1:26:58] because you can have an automobile and
[1:27:01] your house will be just not even a block
[1:27:04] away
[1:27:06] and instead of walking
[1:27:08] we jump in the car
[1:27:10] and we go to the store
[1:27:12] which do what make you weaker
[1:27:16] [Music]
[1:27:19] it literally takes away the strength of
[1:27:22] your body
[1:27:23] y'all better hear what I'm saying see
[1:27:25] science is something else it's like a
[1:27:28] serpent if you're not careful
[1:27:30] Hallelujah right
[1:27:33] how many times you let me say it like
[1:27:35] this we used to America used to go hunt
[1:27:39] for our food
[1:27:41] and when you would go hunt you had to
[1:27:44] kill it
[1:27:45] you had to dress it
[1:27:47] process it did bring it home
[1:27:51] Hallelujah you used
[1:27:54] your body and it kept you strong
[1:27:58] what about science how the Medics and
[1:28:00] you know medicine everywhere
[1:28:02] that the medicine is also made us weak
[1:28:06] Hallelujah because we don't get into the
[1:28:09] all of the germs and the stuff out there
[1:28:11] oh we just wash everything
[1:28:14] there's nothing wrong with being clean
[1:28:17] Hallelujah
[1:28:19] but you must understand amen as we uh
[1:28:23] continue to open the door to science it
[1:28:26] makes us weaker
[1:28:30] that's true the only you know I shop
[1:28:33] yeah I go hunting
[1:28:35] but it's in the grocery store
[1:28:40] Holly
[1:28:42] so you got to understand I appreciate
[1:28:45] the grocery stores yeah I tried to do a
[1:28:47] little hunting this last year you know
[1:28:49] some deer and some you know and and you
[1:28:52] know
[1:28:53] and I found out turkeys are not done
[1:29:04] this the way we used to be but God said
[1:29:08] it
[1:29:09] he purposed it to be this way
[1:29:12] the reason why amen because he wants you
[1:29:15] to understand there's nothing you can do
[1:29:19] outside of believing what he can do for
[1:29:22] you
[1:29:23] oh I'm coming let me hurry up by God's
[1:29:25] grace because I'm not going to preach
[1:29:27] long life like I did last night but I
[1:29:29] want you to understand by God's grace is
[1:29:32] that God has given us the victory
[1:29:35] let's let's say that tonight God has
[1:29:39] given us the victory Hallelujah listen
[1:29:43] the Bible tells us that Abraham's
[1:29:47] daggered not at the promises of God now
[1:29:50] I wonder I want to really give you a
[1:29:52] visual of things that of the impossible
[1:29:55] so that you can see that God is still
[1:29:57] the same and he can make those things
[1:29:59] that's impossible possible
[1:30:03] Hallelujah
[1:30:04] you say oh brother the Lord let me see
[1:30:07] I've dropped out see let me tell you
[1:30:09] something what science did
[1:30:11] I have to go back because that's what he
[1:30:13] told me so you got to realize by God's
[1:30:15] grace
[1:30:16] science
[1:30:17] is the thing that caused the world's
[1:30:21] pollution
[1:30:23] right
[1:30:24] and let me break it down to you there
[1:30:27] was a time there was a district where
[1:30:30] unclean women would be
[1:30:33] and you had the journey to that District
[1:30:37] there was a time amen that unclean books
[1:30:42] oh come on y'all getting quiet
[1:30:44] you giving yourself away
[1:30:53] Hallelujah because those unclean books
[1:30:56] and that people had their duck and Dodge
[1:30:59] and run and hide just to get them
[1:31:03] but science
[1:31:05] Hallelujah has placed it on what we call
[1:31:08] an iPhone
[1:31:09] [Applause]
[1:31:11] Hallelujah you don't have to go nowhere
[1:31:14] you can just hit buttons
[1:31:17] and the filth of the world will come
[1:31:19] right on your screen
[1:31:22] y'all hear what I'm saying and there are
[1:31:25] those in here who are addicted and you
[1:31:28] need Deliverance
[1:31:32] and God can
[1:31:35] and God will
[1:31:37] Hallelujah now he told me he reminded me
[1:31:40] to say that because there must be
[1:31:42] somebody in here that needs to be
[1:31:45] delivered from pornography and all that
[1:31:48] wicked stuff
[1:31:49] oh y'all getting quiet but God knows who
[1:31:53] you are
[1:31:55] oh and the thing about it you come up in
[1:31:59] prayer but you're not ready to surrender
[1:32:02] Hallelujah you can't get this victory
[1:32:05] until you surrender
[1:32:06] Hallelujah
[1:32:08] oh come on somebody it's the truth oh
[1:32:12] that can't be among us it is
[1:32:18] you love the Lord
[1:32:20] the word is a deliverer
[1:32:22] and if you want to be delivered tonight
[1:32:24] you can be delivered
[1:32:26] hallelujah amen why do you think that
[1:32:29] presence was that was in here earlier
[1:32:31] still yet but now you got to understand
[1:32:34] he didn't come to make you feel good he
[1:32:37] came to deliver you
[1:32:40] and for those of us who need the Holy
[1:32:42] Ghost he come to give you the Holy Ghost
[1:32:46] let me tell you something you can be a
[1:32:48] monk on a mountain top with all by
[1:32:52] yourself
[1:32:53] and if you're not converted
[1:32:56] the devil is there with you
[1:33:00] and let me tell you something about the
[1:33:02] mind the Mind knows how to imagined evil
[1:33:08] you can't get rid of the devil until you
[1:33:11] get Jesus on the inside
[1:33:14] and then when you have Christ he's still
[1:33:18] going to knock on your door but at that
[1:33:20] time you tell him you got the wrong
[1:33:22] house
[1:33:23] you got the wrong number
[1:33:26] Hallelujah desperation that's what we
[1:33:29] need we need to be more desperate
[1:33:31] and let me tell you something this is
[1:33:33] the devil's tricks you know that right
[1:33:36] even in the days of Sodom he made them
[1:33:39] think it was okay the the Sun was
[1:33:41] shining the birds were singing
[1:33:44] everything seemed normal
[1:33:47] except one thing they got their warning
[1:33:51] they got a warning that they should have
[1:33:54] taken heed to but they did not
[1:33:56] but when the fire fell
[1:33:58] it was too late
[1:34:00] you understand me
[1:34:02] let me tell y'all something we've got
[1:34:04] the World Council of churches in all of
[1:34:06] these systems that are going to work
[1:34:07] against us
[1:34:09] and if you don't have the Holy if you
[1:34:11] missed the rapture
[1:34:13] I'm talking about people in this message
[1:34:14] you Mr rapture
[1:34:17] you have no idea the torment that you're
[1:34:22] going to have
[1:34:23] because you fail to move and trust God
[1:34:28] to deliver you from whatever that
[1:34:31] darkness is
[1:34:33] hallelujah amen understand it is the
[1:34:36] little foxes
[1:34:38] that spoils the Vine
[1:34:41] I've been doing anything that that's
[1:34:43] really gross to everybody but it's just
[1:34:46] that little thing
[1:34:48] of selfishness
[1:34:52] gnosticism
[1:34:54] when everything's got to go your way
[1:34:58] hello
[1:34:59] when everything must have something to
[1:35:02] do with you or you don't want to have
[1:35:03] nothing to do with it
[1:35:05] oh we don't have that kind in the church
[1:35:07] yes we do
[1:35:10] Hallelujah you know it's amazing you got
[1:35:13] a pastor and you got
[1:35:16] songs to sing what they don't like
[1:35:19] Hallelujah
[1:35:22] glory to God I don't know who you are
[1:35:24] but I'm a preacher just like he want me
[1:35:26] to preach it
[1:35:27] you better understand when you come into
[1:35:30] the house of the king you supposed to
[1:35:34] handle yourself
[1:35:36] yeah
[1:35:38] Hallelujah
[1:35:40] oh it's your truth
[1:35:42] we got people and you don't even know
[1:35:44] stubbornness as as witchcraft
[1:35:47] you don't understand you're being
[1:35:49] Anointed with the Witchcraft Spirit just
[1:35:52] by being stubborn
[1:35:53] oh my Daddy's starving my mother's
[1:35:56] stubborn and I guarantee you they won't
[1:35:58] make heaven without if they continue to
[1:36:01] be that way and neither will you
[1:36:06] God help me Jesus
[1:36:08] you better understand
[1:36:10] you got so many people in and you know I
[1:36:13] think I'm a pastor I've been a pastor
[1:36:15] for years now
[1:36:17] and everywhere you go you find almost
[1:36:20] the same people
[1:36:21] just with different faces
[1:36:26] it's the truth
[1:36:28] it's the truth and you think oh my God I
[1:36:30] tell you what I've heard so much stuff
[1:36:32] among people that's Acclaim to be the
[1:36:35] message I couldn't believe that people
[1:36:36] in the message could do it
[1:36:39] you see that's not it they might be in
[1:36:42] the message but the message has never
[1:36:44] gotten into them
[1:36:46] Hallelujah you've got to an egg this is
[1:36:49] what I'm trying to tell you you can be
[1:36:51] married to a system
[1:36:53] Hallelujah you can dress right you can
[1:36:55] wear your hair alone you can do all
[1:36:57] those things but let me tell you
[1:36:59] something that's not going to assure you
[1:37:01] in heaven you must be born again
[1:37:05] Hallelujah of the water and the spirit
[1:37:08] is that right this is what I love about
[1:37:11] it when John introduced Jesus or talked
[1:37:14] about him he said he shall come
[1:37:17] with the baptism
[1:37:19] Hallelujah the baptism of what
[1:37:24] but people don't want fire you give
[1:37:27] me your fire
[1:37:28] I want the fire of the Holy Ghost I want
[1:37:33] them to burn every demon away from me
[1:37:35] yeah
[1:37:37] that's right the Bible says in this last
[1:37:40] day and then the prophet God said the
[1:37:43] Holy Ghost and Fire should burn every
[1:37:46] demon away from you
[1:37:49] Hallelujah is that right in the future
[1:37:52] home Hallelujah he said the world gets a
[1:37:55] fire baptism he said that is a shadow
[1:37:58] and the type of the baptism that every
[1:38:01] individual must go through
[1:38:03] you don't have a choice
[1:38:05] oh I'm scared of that Holy Ghost
[1:38:07] Hallelujah
[1:38:09] yes because you know what it takes you
[1:38:12] out of control
[1:38:22] as long as you think you're gonna be in
[1:38:23] control
[1:38:26] you won't get nothing
[1:38:29] God like if I could say it like this he
[1:38:33] like to make you look like a fool
[1:38:39] hmm he took Israel which one was one of
[1:38:42] the most starchest people ever
[1:38:44] Hallelujah come on you can't get more
[1:38:46] starches in Israel
[1:38:48] when it came to the law
[1:38:50] and he chose them
[1:38:52] and took them up into the upper room
[1:38:56] they've never been like that before
[1:38:59] everything was one two three four five
[1:39:01] six however
[1:39:02] everything was pristine everything was
[1:39:05] just perfect
[1:39:06] and here come the Holy Ghost

[1:39:13] they did not have to worry about it they
[1:39:16] did not to have to they didn't have to
[1:39:18] have anyone to tell them it was the Holy
[1:39:20] Ghost when that fire came down they
[1:39:24] began to jump they began to shout they
[1:39:26] began to speak in tongues Hallelujah and
[1:39:28] guess what they didn't keep it in the
[1:39:31] church

[1:42:21] not gotten the victory in God because
[1:42:23] you don't love him like you say you do
[1:42:29] Faith or love working by faith working
[1:42:31] by love
[1:42:33] when you love God it produces faith it
[1:42:37] brings action

[1:42:43] of what other peoples think about you

[1:48:54] there'll be many Christians who will
[1:48:56] miss the Rapture because of their
[1:48:58] families

[1:49:27] you're right you're right whether you be
[1:49:29] my mother my brother my sister my cousin
[1:49:32] it does not matter because you know why
[1:49:35] I see him
[1:49:37] he's looking at me he's building
[1:49:40] character in me and the test that comes
[1:49:43] my way he wants to see whether I love
[1:49:45] him more than anything
[1:49:50] and I do not encourage bad habits
[1:49:59] is it true
[1:50:01] even my children when they at home and
[1:50:03] they got their grandkids the grandkids
[1:50:05] are there and they can't control them
[1:50:07] they say we're going to tell Grandpa
[1:50:12] all I have to do is spank my grandkids
[1:50:14] one time
[1:50:15] I have no more trouble
[1:50:19] um
[1:50:23] yeah I don't have to
[1:50:26] have to they don't forget right you see
[1:50:28] when God spank you and spank you in a
[1:50:31] good way when the Devil comes back with
[1:50:33] that that that test you the devil said
[1:50:36] why don't you just do steel let me use
[1:50:38] that for an example why don't you just
[1:50:40] go ahead and steal that piece of candy
[1:50:42] will you remember the weapon you got
[1:50:46] and you know what you tell the devil you
[1:50:48] go head on and do it
[1:50:51] yeah you get me in trouble no more why
[1:50:53] because you're laughing at me while I'm
[1:50:55] getting the beaten
[1:50:59] oh it's the truth
[1:51:01] the devil will tell you to steal and
[1:51:03] he'll tell that policeman on the corner
[1:51:05] he's stealing
[1:51:09] while he's telling you to steal he's
[1:51:11] telling the police what you're doing and
[1:51:13] you get caught
[1:51:15] and then when you get called he says
[1:51:17] you're so stupid
[1:51:26] the truth he gets you in trouble and he
[1:51:28] jumps out the way like oh you're so
[1:51:30] stupid
[1:51:32] and what we need to do is make the devil
[1:51:34] feel stupid for bringing that kind of
[1:51:36] thought to our minds
[1:51:39] I know there's an elementary but I trust
[1:51:41] you're being blessed by it
[1:51:50] y'all understand me the blood of Jesus
[1:51:53] Christ was so powerful it literally
[1:51:55] saved the whole world
[1:51:59] can I say that again the blood of Jesus
[1:52:01] Christ amen is so powerful it literally
[1:52:05] saved the whole world the only reason
[1:52:08] why people go to hell is because they
[1:52:10] refuse to accept the atonement of the
[1:52:13] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:52:15] that's it
[1:52:17] they choose to go that way
[1:52:20] Hallelujah now let me tell you something
[1:52:23] what can I do I can't allow Jesus to be
[1:52:26] a figment of my imagination
[1:52:28] no so he's got to be real to me
[1:52:31] y'all see what I'm saying I I came
[1:52:33] through so many churches amen uh raised
[1:52:36] Baptists from the Baptist I went to the
[1:52:38] Methodist from the Methodist I went to
[1:52:39] the Catholic from the Catholic I went to
[1:52:41] the apostolic amen and then I came into
[1:52:43] this message
[1:52:45] you know why I asked God where are you
[1:52:51] where are you you know what he told me
[1:52:54] I'm in my word
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:52:58] see this is why I worship Him
[1:53:01] you got to understand this is why
[1:53:02] because I realized everything
[1:53:06] in yourself stand
[1:53:08] Hallelujah the word of the Lord shall
[1:53:11] stand
[1:53:12] glory to God Amen so we realize we're
[1:53:15] living in a time and I'm not like I said
[1:53:17] I'm gonna be long but we're living in a
[1:53:19] time of Exodus
[1:53:21] with time how many of y'all believe that
[1:53:25] yes see if you see that's the trick
[1:53:28] that's the trick
[1:53:30] because the devil make you think you got
[1:53:32] more time
[1:53:34] isn't that what he did inside them you
[1:53:36] know I got to finish my house
[1:53:39] he distracted them he made everything
[1:53:42] more important than the visitation of
[1:53:44] the angel
[1:53:46] y'all understand me that's not it
[1:53:49] the angel the messenger the word is more
[1:53:53] important than anything else
[1:53:56] this is where you focus in order to
[1:53:58] escape
[1:54:00] y'all hear what I'm saying when you
[1:54:02] allow the world Amen to take your
[1:54:04] attention the devil is trapping you
[1:54:10] hallelujah oh God help us here because
[1:54:13] we want to be Victorious and you know
[1:54:15] what what gets me the anointing was here
[1:54:18] and you just saw just a few people
[1:54:20] entering in you know why because the
[1:54:23] devil told you it wasn't the right order
[1:54:27] this this
[1:54:28] and after the word
[1:54:31] hallelujah oh yeah there were some here
[1:54:34] it may not have been you but I know what
[1:54:36] I'm talking about and they stood there
[1:54:38] in their seats
[1:54:41] what you need to do and learn to do is
[1:54:44] whenever the holy spirit is moving you
[1:54:47] move with it
[1:54:49] [Applause]
[1:54:53] Hallelujah God is the order
[1:54:58] hallelujah oh God help us Jesus we're so
[1:55:02] indoctrinated sometimes we just don't
[1:55:04] even understand what God is doing
[1:55:07] Hallelujah think about it
[1:55:10] this woman amen was in such a
[1:55:13] desperation and everybody thrown in
[1:55:15] Jesus what was the difference
[1:55:18] people bumping into me because they
[1:55:20] curious there's like church people
[1:55:22] they're looking around to see him do
[1:55:24] something something you know
[1:55:25] Supernatural
[1:55:27] but this woman had a need
[1:55:29] and see when you come to church with a
[1:55:31] knee you come amen for that need to be
[1:55:34] met
[1:55:35] Hallelujah you should never come to
[1:55:37] church and leave out intent
[1:55:42] well oh well he I didn't feel him no no
[1:55:44] no no no no see even when I don't feel
[1:55:47] it
[1:55:48] still working
[1:55:49] Hallelujah
[1:55:51] even when I don't feel him he's still
[1:55:54] working
[1:55:54] when I don't see him he's still working
[1:55:57] Hallelujah he's always walking
[1:56:02] Hallelujah yes Lord you say you say well
[1:56:06] y'all did y'all notice that did you
[1:56:09] notice how much God liked that song
[1:56:13] that was God coming down because he
[1:56:15] liked that song
[1:56:17] [Applause]
[1:56:19] Hallelujah y'all understand me when God
[1:56:21] vindicates something he's it's his
[1:56:24] approval
[1:56:25] oh God help us here
[1:56:28] you know I couldn't help it I'm over
[1:56:30] there weeping and everything else and
[1:56:31] like oh my God I'm weeping I'm weeping a
[1:56:33] muck I'm gonna preach
[1:56:36] but anyway she was desperate
[1:56:39] she was so desperate and that's the
[1:56:42] thing
[1:56:45] my wife and I have eight children
[1:56:49] and when my first
[1:56:51] child went wayward
[1:56:55] we thought we were going to have a
[1:56:57] nervous breakdown
[1:56:59] we cry we cry almost like a month
[1:57:01] straight
[1:57:03] because we couldn't understand what went
[1:57:05] wrong
[1:57:07] and we went to her one day after things
[1:57:10] had come back she had come back to the
[1:57:11] law see because once you understand what
[1:57:13] I'm saying when you're desperate
[1:57:15] Satan can trick them
[1:57:19] but your desperation brings them back
[1:57:23] is she because God had to teach me
[1:57:25] something brother Shelley
[1:57:27] he taught me that I had Pride
[1:57:31] ain't no way my children
[1:57:34] not mine
[1:57:36] will ever go out into the world or
[1:57:38] backslide not brother Brook's children
[1:57:43] pride and you know what my love for her
[1:57:47] was hindered by my pride
[1:57:51] instead of the grace and love I wanted
[1:57:54] to bring the law
[1:57:57] I'm saying that's exactly what a lot of
[1:57:59] us when your children go
[1:58:03] and go Pride you're more concerned about
[1:58:05] what other people are going to think
[1:58:06] about you and you fail to see the heart
[1:58:09] that they're going through
[1:58:11] and the need that they have
[1:58:17] don't tell me I've been there
[1:58:23] but when God was able to show me my
[1:58:25] pride
[1:58:26] that's when I broke
[1:58:28] that's when I had to ask him for for my
[1:58:31] forgiveness
[1:58:33] and my wife and I went in desperation
[1:58:35] Hallelujah we didn't went in the prayer
[1:58:38] and then you know even she's me one
[1:58:39] thing I can say about her she may not be
[1:58:42] the strongest of all Christians but she
[1:58:44] loved this message
[1:58:47] ending today
[1:58:50] Hallelujah
[1:58:51] you say Oh Brother Bruce what are you
[1:58:54] yes it is it is what it is
[1:58:57] but you and I must understand by God's
[1:58:59] grace that the blood covers it all
[1:59:03] I was in prayer one day
[1:59:05] and the Lord told me he had given me all
[1:59:07] of my children
[1:59:09] and he called them all by name
[1:59:12] in in their proper order
[1:59:15] and I can't even do that sometime
[1:59:18] you know what I'm saying I'm calling day
[1:59:20] Isaiah I gave Elijah what's your name
[1:59:26] it gets like that sometimes even with my
[1:59:29] grandkids I have to think about it
[1:59:31] [Laughter]
[1:59:33] it's the truth but you and I must
[1:59:35] understand by God's grace what God is
[1:59:38] doing for us
[1:59:40] you have a kingdom
[1:59:44] the Bible said that God has made us
[1:59:46] Kings and Priests
[1:59:50] therefore God has given you a territory
[1:59:53] God has given you your family come on
[1:59:56] somebody God given you to rule over your
[2:00:00] family
[2:00:02] Hallelujah and when things get out of
[2:00:05] order and you can't handle it you go to
[2:00:07] the high order you go to the King of
[2:00:11] Kings
[2:00:13] Hallelujah
[2:00:14] it's the truth it is what God wants us
[2:00:17] to do he wants us to sanctify our house
[2:00:22] [Music]
[2:00:24] King Sanctified with all kind of TVs and
[2:00:26] everything kind of thing
[2:00:29] oh y'all got so quiet on that one
[2:00:35] yes we gonna look at we're gonna live
[2:00:37] stream
[2:00:38] and after live stream what else
[2:00:44] all I'm saying is if the Holy Ghost
[2:00:46] won't look at it you better not
[2:00:50] ain't nothing wrong with things you know
[2:00:52] that's you know decent and godly but if
[2:00:54] the Holy Ghost ain't gonna look at it oh
[2:00:56] you know what I'm saying oh we wouldn't
[2:00:58] even look at anything that had one
[2:01:01] the profanity in it
[2:01:03] now we say
[2:01:05] you know me
[2:01:08] y'all think I've never been there I've
[2:01:10] been there
[2:01:12] I've been there they have a bad scene in
[2:01:14] it and you try to fast forward and all
[2:01:18] you're doing is like
[2:01:23] y'all know it's true fast forward
[2:01:32] it's a joke The Flash can never be
[2:01:36] satisfied
[2:01:40] we need the tokening
[2:01:44] oh God help us here
[2:01:46] oh my what did he do then you got to
[2:01:50] understand the Holy Ghost when Jesus and
[2:01:52] I love this oh I just wish I could act
[2:01:54] it out
[2:01:55] I I wish I could act it out because you
[2:01:58] know I could see him in my vision but I
[2:02:00] don't know how to work it but to think
[2:02:03] that Jesus Christ died for me and all of
[2:02:05] the beatings that he went through and
[2:02:07] you don't even understand we didn't
[2:02:09] understand those mockings on his body
[2:02:11] amen was our own markings
[2:02:14] the Bible even says it was
[2:02:17] and remember the time when the prophet
[2:02:18] of God was uh uh accusing and and
[2:02:22] criticizing the woman she had proper
[2:02:24] hair and purple nails and purple
[2:02:26] everything
[2:02:27] right
[2:02:29] and he's looking at her and says oh Lord
[2:02:31] why don't you just you know destroy this
[2:02:34] thing shatter the fire whatever you need
[2:02:36] to do see that was the voice of Elijah
[2:02:38] when you got mad Lord sin down the fire
[2:02:42] y'all understand me but God said come on
[2:02:44] behind the door
[2:02:46] and that's the problem all of us need a
[2:02:49] behind the door experience
[2:02:53] it's so easy for us to look at somebody
[2:02:55] and judge them by their outward
[2:02:58] appearance
[2:03:00] Hallelujah you don't know what's in
[2:03:02] their hearts
[2:03:04] oh only God knows what was in her heart
[2:03:07] and she looked like she was a Nokia God
[2:03:10] but what it was she was a backslidden
[2:03:13] seed
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:14] [Applause]
[2:03:16] [Music]
[2:03:17] see we so easily want to give up on God
[2:03:20] our own people but God never gives up
[2:03:24] you don't know the background why people
[2:03:26] do what they do
[2:03:28] but God knows the bad
[2:03:35] back the ground but hey he's ready to
[2:03:37] deliver you from all of your things
[2:03:39] you've done in the past
[2:03:41] [Applause]
[2:03:43] you think he can't be touched by the
[2:03:45] feelings of your Pharmacy yes he can
[2:03:47] Hallelujah he's God
[2:03:50] he made he allowed you to be made that
[2:03:53] way so on the day of judgment you can

[2:03:57] how did you overcome by the grace of God
[2:04:01] Hallelujah

[2:05:17] says even in Corinthians and such were
[2:05:21] some of you
[2:05:22] yes whether the world knew who you are
[2:05:26] not it doesn't matter God knows
[2:05:32] yeah
[2:05:34] Hallelujah the same Holy Ghost we're
[2:05:36] talking about it
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:46] you know that's the thing about it
[2:05:47] people say well we're the church and you
[2:05:49] say well you know everybody look at the
[2:05:51] church like everybody's so holy and
[2:05:53] sanctified
[2:05:54] glory to God that's just that's not true
[2:06:00] God trying to get them all holy and
[2:06:02] Sanctified but they ain't all there
[2:06:05] hallelujah it's the truth
[2:06:12] y'all love the Lord
[2:06:15] oh I'm trying to talk to him God's
[2:06:17] speaking to you and you know what he is
[2:06:18] right you know he is and you got to
[2:06:21] listen he ain't here to expose you he's
[2:06:23] here to deliver you
[2:06:25] you know when you come up for prayer you
[2:06:26] don't have to tell me what you want you
[2:06:28] don't even have to tell uh you need you
[2:06:30] could stay in your seat and tell him
[2:06:31] what you want y'all understand what I'm
[2:06:34] saying but the point is whatever you
[2:06:36] want God is able
[2:06:38] you say well I need to say it well I'll
[2:06:41] say it later but you know God you
[2:06:44] understand what I'm saying
[2:06:46] I've seen people that come up and says
[2:06:48] you know in the church a lot you know we
[2:06:49] was the closest thing to Catholicism and
[2:06:52] we were supposed to be the Apostolic
[2:06:54] Church
[2:06:56] um
[2:06:57] oh yeah we would we used to have
[2:06:59] confession night
[2:07:01] I saw more lies destroyed like that
[2:07:04] than ever
[2:07:06] and you stand up before the bishop and
[2:07:07] you tell them all your sins
[2:07:10] but I used to hear people used to they
[2:07:11] said you know I just want the Lord to
[2:07:13] forgive me of my known and my own
[2:07:15] unknown sins
[2:07:17] you know sin unknown
[2:07:21] but it's going to be unknown to you
[2:07:24] right
[2:07:26] I didn't understand what they were
[2:07:28] saying but they were protecting
[2:07:29] themselves
[2:07:31] because when you got weak Spirits in in
[2:07:34] the church and you confess something
[2:07:36] openly and that Spirit hear you
[2:07:39] you're gonna find yourself with a friend
[2:07:42] you don't want
[2:07:45] you hear what I'm saying
[2:07:47] oh sometimes you people you're about to
[2:07:49] wake up and smell the coffee
[2:07:53] some things is between you and God
[2:08:02] it's the truth
[2:08:03] so you're gonna feel like oh everybody's
[2:08:05] as Sanctified as I am and they're going
[2:08:07] to be honest no they're not
[2:08:09] you tell some things that you shouldn't
[2:08:12] tell don't get mad cause they gonna tell
[2:08:14] it
[2:08:16] every best friend has a best friend
[2:08:22] talking to the Lord in prayer that's
[2:08:25] what you need to do now if you're going
[2:08:27] out and you committing sin yes you're
[2:08:29] supposed to do it right but I'm not
[2:08:31] talking about that
[2:08:32] I'm talking about even if you're just
[2:08:34] battling in your spirit about something
[2:08:36] you better be careful who you tell that
[2:08:39] unless you got a real Holy Ghost Field
[2:08:41] sister a brother that you can confide in
[2:08:43] you better keep it to yourself and talk
[2:08:45] to Jesus about it
[2:08:47] y'all looking at me like I'm crazy but
[2:08:50] I'm talking about victory
[2:08:53] that's what happens people in the church
[2:08:55] share things with people then it gets
[2:08:57] out and then you backslide because they
[2:09:00] told your story
[2:09:01] nonsense you shouldn't have never told
[2:09:04] it
[2:09:05] [Music]
[2:09:07] you're gonna fault the person that tells
[2:09:10] it
[2:09:11] you the one who started it
[2:09:17] I don't know why I'm saying these things
[2:09:20] God knows why I know what I'm doing but
[2:09:23] I'm telling you about the grace of God
[2:09:24] God trying to deliver us
[2:09:27] on Christ the solid rock I stand all
[2:09:32] other ground is sinking sand you
[2:09:36] understand me
[2:09:43] well brother you know
[2:09:45] I'm fighting with this demon
[2:09:47] [Music]
[2:09:54] you got to be careful I'm not talking
[2:09:56] about something I don't know what I'm
[2:09:57] talking about
[2:09:59] because I'm gonna tell you something
[2:10:00] when you offend people sometime
[2:10:03] it's hard to win
[2:10:06] back
[2:10:07] it's so hard and it sets a complex on
[2:10:10] them so now they're at a place they
[2:10:12] can't trust nobody
[2:10:14] and you put them in a prison house
[2:10:17] you understand me when God is trying to
[2:10:19] set us free
[2:10:21] some people can't even you know we used
[2:10:23] to have testimony Services real
[2:10:25] testimony service where you can tell
[2:10:26] what God has done but people ain't
[2:10:28] spiritual like they used to be
[2:10:32] help us Jesus you love the Lord
[2:10:35] amen just give me a few more minutes
[2:10:41] as I was saying by God's grace
[2:10:44] we need to be a little more desperate
[2:10:47] and God's going to give it to you
[2:10:50] you don't seek God now
[2:10:52] bring a desperation on you
[2:10:55] and the prophet God said that's the kind
[2:10:56] of people we are
[2:10:58] sometimes we don't even think about God
[2:11:00] until something tragically happens
[2:11:03] how sad that is
[2:11:06] we've got to wait till God push us
[2:11:09] into a place
[2:11:10] right
[2:11:12] and you know the first thing that goes
[2:11:14] wrong we say oh the devil did it
[2:11:18] and the devil has been blamed for so
[2:11:20] many things
[2:11:22] that he didn't do
[2:11:28] it's the truth but what God is trying oh
[2:11:31] I I wish what God is trying to do is get
[2:11:34] you to empty out
[2:11:38] to him
[2:11:40] can you imagine and I don't know the
[2:11:42] conversation that Mary Mary had with him
[2:11:46] but whatever she had
[2:11:48] it was such a secret
[2:11:51] because Jesus asked her he knew the
[2:11:53] battles in her heart in her mind he knew
[2:11:57] that the money she had was for
[2:12:00] prostitution
[2:12:01] he didn't
[2:12:04] [Music]
[2:12:06] just saw a prostitute
[2:12:08] but Jesus saw a daughter
[2:12:11] y'all understand me he didn't stop her
[2:12:14] he saw her desperation and he allowed
[2:12:18] her even though he knew that that church
[2:12:21] service was going to be forever talked
[2:12:23] about
[2:12:25] that's just Jesus who claimed himself to
[2:12:28] be a prophet Mary of all people we know
[2:12:32] her but how do you know her
[2:12:35] we know her
[2:12:37] and he let her touch
[2:12:40] him now you got to realize
[2:12:43] in the natural the natural man's eye
[2:12:46] that looked bad
[2:12:49] looked real bad
[2:12:51] knowing what she was and she's not only
[2:12:54] washing his feet and drying with their
[2:12:57] hair and crying and slobbering and
[2:12:58] whatever snotting and everything else
[2:13:02] she's a prostitute
[2:13:04] and he claims to be a prophet
[2:13:08] he ought to know better
[2:13:10] let me tell you all something when it
[2:13:13] comes to these people and that's what
[2:13:14] folks don't understand you think you're
[2:13:16] going to be defiled
[2:13:19] because you've seen with the prostitute
[2:13:21] or if you preach in the gospel
[2:13:24] if you're giving them the word
[2:13:27] y'all understand me I
[2:13:29] brother you may have heard me say this I
[2:13:32] had a brother one time go into a bar
[2:13:35] and preached to the body the owner of
[2:13:39] the bar
[2:13:40] he preached and the owner of the bar got
[2:13:43] saved
[2:13:45] came into this message
[2:13:48] on his bar
[2:13:50] you'll understand me
[2:13:53] see that's what people don't understand
[2:13:55] wherever he leaves me I will follow
[2:14:00] that's the way Jesus is he don't care
[2:14:03] about what the what the what the
[2:14:05] majority of people say
[2:14:08] that's probably why we haven't taken a
[2:14:09] Rapture yet
[2:14:11] because we're too prideful and God can't
[2:14:13] lead us into places that you think he
[2:14:17] would not
[2:14:20] hmm you know God saved that man and it
[2:14:24] was just shortly after that he had he
[2:14:27] was going to his Pastor's house with his
[2:14:29] Bible in his hand he got to the door and
[2:14:32] knocked fell dead
[2:14:37] you tell me God
[2:14:39] cares
[2:14:41] y'all understand me you just don't know
[2:14:44] when that time is and that's why it's
[2:14:47] always important when God you say well
[2:14:50] brother Brooks we're in the mat we're in
[2:14:51] the messaging and we don't have to
[2:14:52] witness when did he ever change it
[2:14:56] yeah
[2:14:58] Hallelujah is that right because after
[2:15:01] his resurrection after he showed them
[2:15:04] who they were he said go ye there and
[2:15:07] tear into Jerusalem until you be endured
[2:15:10] with power for ye shall be Witnesses of
[2:15:13] me
[2:15:13] [Applause]
[2:15:16] that's where we are he's revealing to us
[2:15:21] who he is
[2:15:22] and you and I must know the power is
[2:15:25] coming
[2:15:26] Hallelujah and now yes
[2:15:31] people say oh no yes I'll tell you what
[2:15:34] brother Brandon said many times amen
[2:15:36] that before the rapture we will have
[2:15:38] another outpouring
[2:15:44] you love the Lord
[2:15:46] Hallelujah
[2:15:48] well if you love him you'll be willing
[2:15:50] to surrender when I'm done
[2:15:52] not to me
[2:15:54] to him
[2:15:55] because just all of this anointing you
[2:15:57] feeling and the shouting and the that's
[2:15:59] him
[2:16:00] but he want to take it further
[2:16:03] it's not enough to say oh honey I love
[2:16:05] you you're so sweet
[2:16:08] you see that's surface love
[2:16:11] he won't intimacy
[2:16:17] God help us
[2:16:19] so what
[2:16:20] as I said a desperation and this is one
[2:16:23] of my favorite
[2:16:24] and we're going to close in just a
[2:16:26] minute
[2:16:27] but the thing that gets me
[2:16:30] is somehow it works
[2:16:32] I don't know
[2:16:35] Jesus was a man that whatever God said
[2:16:38] if I could say it like this
[2:16:40] he did it
[2:16:41] there was no hesitation
[2:16:45] did it
[2:16:47] and you know I'm saying that we got him
[2:16:49] inside of us
[2:16:50] right why do we have to process things
[2:16:54] don't you know the voice of God
[2:16:57] you should by now
[2:17:00] Hallelujah you should know the voice of
[2:17:03] God a brother said to me he had a pro he
[2:17:06] had a a special thing
[2:17:08] um that he requiring he was asking God
[2:17:10] for something and he said brother books
[2:17:13] I had the strangest experience he said I
[2:17:16] Heard a Voice in the voice said I have
[2:17:18] given this to you
[2:17:20] he said but it didn't come from my head
[2:17:22] it came from the inside
[2:17:24] I'm like that's where it's supposed to
[2:17:26] come from
[2:17:28] right you know if it's just going to
[2:17:30] come to your head you ought to question
[2:17:32] it but when he speaks from the inside
[2:17:36] anybody know what I'm talking about well
[2:17:39] he speaks from the inside you don't have
[2:17:42] to worry about who it is or what it is
[2:17:45] you know it's gone
[2:17:48] only God speaks from this heart
[2:17:50] Hallelujah the devil might get in my
[2:17:52] head but God speaks from this heart
[2:17:56] Hallelujah and I'm gonna tell y'all
[2:17:59] something so you could understand I'm
[2:18:01] not here to be uh
[2:18:04] if I wanted to be famous
[2:18:06] I could have been
[2:18:10] if I wanted to be some proud pigeon
[2:18:12] sitting on something I could have done
[2:18:14] that
[2:18:16] I'm saying this for somebody
[2:18:19] but I surrendered all to God
[2:18:23] and I'm telling you by God's grace I
[2:18:25] can't have been a multi-million I had
[2:18:27] the opportunities
[2:18:30] but I saw one thing that everybody that
[2:18:33] had all of this wasn't happy
[2:18:40] I treasure my joy I treasure my
[2:18:43] happiness I treasure my peace and and
[2:18:47] you know what I found all of that in
[2:18:50] Jesus
[2:18:52] I'm the only one in my family that
[2:18:54] believed this message
[2:18:57] they excommunicated me they still think
[2:19:00] I'm a fool
[2:19:02] Hallelujah some of them declared
[2:19:05] themselves to be Christians
[2:19:09] excuse me
[2:19:12] you know I love them
[2:19:14] but I know the truth
[2:19:17] and I don't want my living to be in vain
[2:19:20] but you see there's a lot of Christians
[2:19:22] who's living is in vain
[2:19:25] why wasn't that God wasn't faithful
[2:19:29] but they weren't willing
[2:19:31] what is this world Goods
[2:19:34] when you know you're gonna die
[2:19:38] if the Rapture don't take place you're
[2:19:40] going to die I don't care if you live to
[2:19:43] see 200 you're still gonna die
[2:19:48] Hallelujah and that's what I'm preparing
[2:19:50] for I'm preparing that if if God should
[2:19:53] come after I lay down
[2:19:56] that when I lay down I got my ticket
[2:20:00] I'm getting up
[2:20:02] see I'm preparing for the world to come
[2:20:04] because I know it's there
[2:20:06] Hallelujah the pains and the sorrows and
[2:20:09] the turmoils and everything I go through
[2:20:12] here means nothing
[2:20:15] y'all understand me
[2:20:17] the truth of the matter is
[2:20:19] he's real and the world he's made for me
[2:20:24] and you is real
[2:20:26] Hallelujah you said well what do you
[2:20:28] mean this is why I love this message so
[2:20:30] much because Paul couldn't talk about it
[2:20:34] but the prophet of God said I went over
[2:20:35] there he said whatever you do don't you
[2:20:38] miss it
[2:20:39] Hallelujah he said don't miss this
[2:20:42] Hallelujah people of God think about
[2:20:44] people who miss the Rapture because they
[2:20:46] failed to take off high-heeled shoes
[2:20:49] what a torment you mean to tell me I
[2:20:53] miss Heaven because of these stupid
[2:20:55] things that man made
[2:20:57] [Music]
[2:21:01] hallelujah it's the truth
[2:21:03] and you know what people don't
[2:21:04] understand amen that God said you got to
[2:21:07] be holy
[2:21:09] oh high-heeled shoes you you fight that
[2:21:11] every every preacher every Pastor even
[2:21:13] in this message fight that and you know
[2:21:15] what the prophet said
[2:21:18] but you see they think they're so
[2:21:19] Justified
[2:21:22] oh I'm elected yeah you are everybody's
[2:21:25] elected
[2:21:26] you know that you were either elected to
[2:21:28] go to heaven or you're elected
[2:21:32] elected vessel obana or you're elected
[2:21:34] to be a vessel Of Dishonor
[2:21:37] you've been chosen one or the other
[2:21:39] because God had purposed you
[2:21:43] is that right
[2:21:44] but I want to make sure my purpose my
[2:21:47] purpose is to glorify him
[2:21:50] oh God help me
[2:21:56] and we played enough
[2:22:01] how are we going to keep on playing
[2:22:06] how many times how many of y'all have
[2:22:09] ever
[2:22:10] gotten a whipping
[2:22:14] for playing

[2:26:11] yeah
[2:26:15] because God is speaking to you
[2:26:19] right now I want to say to you
[2:26:21] the Lord has spoken
[2:26:23] there's a lot could be said
[2:26:25] and I trust that if I left out anything
[2:26:27] today that he'll give me Grace to bring
[2:26:30] it tomorrow
[2:26:31] because I want everybody to understand
[2:26:34] amen that we need to you know
[2:26:37] [Music]
[2:26:37] um
[2:26:46] trade in everything
[2:26:50] give everything up for Jesus
[2:26:53] you don't know when you're gonna die
[2:26:55] you could be young you can be old middle
[2:26:58] age whatever but when that time come it
[2:27:01] comes
[2:27:02] sometimes people are sick and it happens
[2:27:05] but sometimes people just drop dead
[2:27:07] I know a few people that had just was
[2:27:09] standing and boom no sickness no nothing
[2:27:12] the doctor said all I can tell you is
[2:27:13] that they hard stopped
[2:27:15] you don't know
[2:27:17] and you know well I play Russian
[2:27:19] Roulette you know I don't even
[2:27:21] understand why everybody in the world
[2:27:23] don't want to be a Christian I think
[2:27:26] Christian being a Christian has been the
[2:27:27] greatest thing that I've ever become
[2:27:30] I had opportunities you know all kind
[2:27:34] and for whatever reason God gave me this
[2:27:38] thing where people like me and I don't
[2:27:40] understand that either
[2:27:42] seriously
[2:27:43] serious I I you know it's the truth even
[2:27:46] before I got saved people like me and
[2:27:48] you know what it would be a thing you
[2:27:49] know I would go you know it wasn't even
[2:27:51] trying to promote myself or go up the
[2:27:54] ladder you know and I would it would
[2:27:56] happen
[2:27:57] even when I was a sinner
[2:27:59] I don't know what it is
[2:28:02] well you know if I had people say well
[2:28:03] brother books I know you bride I I know
[2:28:05] you're gonna make the Rapture and I'm
[2:28:06] thinking wow
[2:28:08] is that God
[2:28:12] because somebody something gave them
[2:28:14] that inspiration
[2:28:17] to say those things to me
[2:28:20] and I'm looking at myself like how
[2:28:23] and I had to understand that it's not my
[2:28:25] works this is Grace
[2:28:30] even when I was a little boy those old
[2:28:32] mamas used to tell me Tell My Mama he
[2:28:34] gonna be a preacher
[2:28:35] he got a preacher's head
[2:28:37] I don't know I don't know what that is
[2:28:39] but that may you know if this is a
[2:28:41] preacher's head but my point is
[2:28:44] I don't even know how they you would
[2:28:46] know those kind of things
[2:28:48] I ran from preaching
[2:28:50] I didn't want to be a preacher I saw
[2:28:53] what rev was and I didn't want to be
[2:28:55] what red was
[2:28:56] you understand me
[2:29:00] didn't want to be a pastor either
[2:29:03] I saw the sufferings of a pastor
[2:29:06] some of my friends were pastors
[2:29:08] I ran from being a pastor and when they
[2:29:11] asked me to be a pastor I laughed
[2:29:14] are you kidding me do you really think I
[2:29:19] want to be a pastor
[2:29:22] it took five years for him to get it
[2:29:26] five years and all of a sudden I'm a
[2:29:28] pastor like Lord what am I doing here
[2:29:32] and then I start a Bible study and that
[2:29:36] Bible study sprung up and there's more
[2:29:38] people in that church than the one I'm
[2:29:39] pastoring
[2:29:41] so I got two churches
[2:29:43] and I'm like oh God have mercy you know
[2:29:46] I don't believe in polygamy
[2:29:59] you know what I'm saying Lord help me
[2:30:02] so y'all pray for me
[2:30:04] because what we what what I just I don't
[2:30:06] want to stop this let me I'll talk about
[2:30:08] that later some other time but my point
[2:30:10] is you see how the enemy try to pull me
[2:30:11] into that
[2:30:13] there's a there's something more
[2:30:14] important than that
[2:30:16] it's you
[2:30:17] and right now God is here
[2:30:21] and God want to do something for you
[2:30:24] but you can't get from God if you're
[2:30:26] afraid that he is not able
[2:30:29] so many people don't get what they
[2:30:31] because you think God is not going to
[2:30:33] keep his promise God keeps all of his
[2:30:37] promises
[2:30:39] like I said when earlier I was on my
[2:30:41] knees one time and God told me he was
[2:30:43] going to give me all my children you
[2:30:45] know what I did I testified
[2:30:47] and the devil said you should have never
[2:30:49] testified of that as soon as I did they
[2:30:51] went
[2:30:53] and they doing things and have done
[2:30:55] things
[2:30:58] and I think to myself oh God
[2:31:01] there's a miracle in the making yes
[2:31:06] because that's what it's going to take
[2:31:09] but is there anything too hard for God
[2:31:15] Mercy there's nothing too hard for God
[2:31:19] Hallelujah I don't care what your
[2:31:22] problems are tonight give it up
[2:31:25] somebody said well how do you surrender
[2:31:27] brother Brooks I said this is how you
[2:31:29] surrender you let it go
[2:31:32] and you don't pick it back up
[2:31:35] that's how you surrender
[2:31:37] like I was saying somebody the other day
[2:31:39] I said it's like chicken
[2:31:42] when you give it up
[2:31:43] you don't care how good is smell you're
[2:31:46] not going to get another piece

[2:32:09] you only got Fried Chicken on Sundays
[2:32:15] and you was hoping your mama did not
[2:32:18] invite the preacher
[2:32:23] cause whenever he invite the preacher he
[2:32:26] ate all the best parts and gave you the
[2:32:29] next
[2:32:30] and the backs
[2:32:32] and I'm telling you he gave it up he
[2:32:34] didn't realize how good those necks and
[2:32:36] those backstage you
[2:32:38] but you got the
[2:32:41] doctor I know it's I know it sounds
[2:32:43] funny but I'm telling you it's the truth
[2:32:48] so God had to I like fried chicken I
[2:32:50] like it now I don't love it anymore

[2:35:57] crying it's not special when it's about
[2:35:59] him
[2:36:02] sometimes your emotions because of
[2:36:04] traditions and things I had a friend of
[2:36:07] mine who was a boxer and he had to train
[2:36:09] himself not to cry and he he couldn't
[2:36:12] cry I said brother God will give you

[2:37:33] that we're speaking and goddess God is
[2:37:36] speaking don't look at the flesh this

[2:37:58] one greater sin one sin greater than the
[2:38:00] other
[2:38:01] and we all have come short of the glory
[2:38:03] of God and think about it there was not
[2:38:05] one Prophet that could stand and take
[2:38:08] the book out of the right hand of him
[2:38:09] who sat on the throne Hallelujah not one
[2:38:13] not even John himself
[2:38:16] Hallelujah

[2:41:41] know what Joy is
[2:41:44] that's that's worth praying for
[2:41:47] the Bible said the joy of the Lord is
[2:41:49] our strength
[2:41:51] and if you want joy God is able to give
[2:41:53] that like I said you don't have to come

[2:41:56] there
[2:41:57] Wherever You Are
[2:41:59] but what we want you to know is that
[2:42:03] I personally believe
[2:42:05] [Music]
[2:42:08] that God gave me this message and
[2:42:09] there's somebody
[2:42:11] he spoke to
[2:42:14] if not just some all
[2:42:18] and you you need to say yes Lord
[2:42:21] it's me
[2:42:23] standing in the need of prayer

[2:42:29] you don't have to be embarrassed about
[2:42:31] anything
[2:42:31] [Music]
[2:42:34] God knows your thoughts are far off
[2:42:37] [Music]
[2:42:39] that's what amazes me about him
[2:42:43] because he can love me brother

[3:59:23] chorus
[3:59:24] the reason why I went down and grabbed
[3:59:26] my children
[3:59:27] is the the enemy there was such a pain
[3:59:30] brother Brooks I was really in pain
[3:59:33] going down both sides sciatic nerve down
[3:59:37] both sides and my legs felt like they
[3:59:39] didn't belong to me they were so heavy
[3:59:41] and that came on me as soon as I thought
[3:59:44] in my mind I'm going to make sure every
[3:59:46] one of my children get prayed for
[3:59:47] tonight
[3:59:49] as soon as I thought that that pain and
[3:59:51] I could just barely pick him up I wanted

[4:00:03] I've been in churches I've been in
[4:00:05] places around this Truth where parents
[4:00:07] come and Drug their children out of a
[4:00:09] prayer line
[4:00:10] I've seen it with my own eyes
[4:00:13] and instead of somebody dragging their
[4:00:15] child out of a prayer line they ought to
[4:00:16] be pushing them
[4:00:17] [Applause]
[4:00:18] you get all you can and can all you get
[4:00:23] while the angel of the Lord troubles the
[4:00:25] water you want to get in and get every
[4:00:27] bit of it and I had no idea that those
[4:00:30] legs would be able to move again I
[4:00:32] thought I'm gonna walk out of here like
[4:00:34] this but you know what he touched me
[4:00:38] he touched me
[4:00:40] Hallelujah
[4:00:42] and now
[4:00:44] now I don't want to get out from under
[4:00:45] the anointing
[4:00:47] I know what can happen sometime when you
[4:00:49] get out from under the anointing so we
[4:00:51] just want to linger
[4:00:53] but we're pretty weary
[4:00:55] we were fellowshipping this morning past
[4:00:57] one o'clock
[4:00:58] and we Fellowship most of the day today
[4:01:01] and there's nothing any sweeter
[4:01:04] oh there's nothing any sweeter but
[4:01:06] sometimes these bodies have got to lay
[4:01:08] down
[4:01:09] and mine's telling me I'm gonna have to
[4:01:11] lay mine down for a little while
[4:01:13] and you know you feel the same
[4:01:15] you're
[4:01:17] say it again brother
[4:01:23] that is the truth
[4:01:28] we used to tell them we used to tell
[4:01:30] them when they didn't like that kind of
[4:01:31] carrying on well if you don't like
[4:01:33] shouting you better not get on the cloud
[4:01:34] with me
[4:01:37] because I'm going to listen
[4:01:39] oh I think we a lot of us started out
[4:01:42] just offering a sacrifice of praise
[4:01:45] uh nothing wrong with that the Bible
[4:01:46] tells us to do that the Bible doesn't
[4:01:48] say once the Holy Ghost strikes you and
[4:01:51] you can't control yourself dancing dance
[4:01:53] before me doesn't say that we like it
[4:01:57] like that don't we but but he said
[4:01:59] praise the Lord in the dance
[4:02:02] and that means sometimes there's just an
[4:02:04] atmosphere where you just gotta dance
[4:02:07] and I'll tell you if you'll do it
[4:02:09] sometime clap a little more whatever it
[4:02:11] is you can do Pat your foot some of you
[4:02:13] if you could just get to the place where
[4:02:14] you could move your toes around in your
[4:02:16] shoes
[4:02:17] you might find some freedom in that
[4:02:20] but you know sometimes when you start
[4:02:22] putting forth that little bit of extra
[4:02:24] sacrifice and doing it I'm I'm going to
[4:02:28] tell you something
[4:02:29] I love you brothers and sisters my um
[4:02:31] former Amish brothers and sisters with
[4:02:34] all my heart and I'm not going to let
[4:02:36] you out praise the Lord
[4:02:40] if you can praise him like that I can
[4:02:42] praise him like that
[4:02:45] when we when we think of the communities
[4:02:47] that they came from we think of very
[4:02:49] reserved you know very reserved worship
[4:02:52] very reserved and you know what that was
[4:02:54] right
[4:02:55] that is right there's a lot of that but
[4:02:58] when these people get a touch of
[4:03:01] Salvation and the joy of the Lord
[4:03:04] they forget all about that that German
[4:03:08] Reserve you know they forget all about
[4:03:10] that and they just want to and I'm not
[4:03:12] going to let them out praise me if they
[4:03:14] can praise the Lord like that I can too
[4:03:18] so you brothers and sisters inspired us
[4:03:20] all you inspired us all Hallelujah

[4:03:36] you've got a conversation to hold hold
[4:03:38] it out in the vestibule or out in the
[4:03:40] front let's come in the morning at 11
