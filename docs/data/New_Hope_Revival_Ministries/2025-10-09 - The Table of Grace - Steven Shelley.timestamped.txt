[0:00] sitting at my dining room table again.
[0:03] Those tears of joy, sir,
[0:05] &gt;&gt; I couldn't stop them from rolling down
[0:08] my cheeks. And my sanctified imagination
[0:12] carried me to a place not so very far
[0:16] away where there will be a table where
[0:19] there is a table
[0:21] &gt;&gt; spread for a million miles long. This is
[0:25] symbolically it meaning that the bride
[0:29] of every age will sit down at that table
[0:34] and we'll be able to look at across at
[0:37] one another testifying to one another
[0:41] how we made it over.
[0:43] &gt;&gt; And you know our circumstances may be
[0:45] different but the way we made it over is
[0:48] all the same. We'll all say by grace.
[0:52] &gt;&gt; By grace through the blood of Jesus
[0:55] Christ. Church, if anybody in this house
[0:57] makes it all the way, you'll make it by
[1:00] grace. You'll make it by the blood. You
[1:04] won't make it because you know who
[1:06] brother Brandham is. You'll only make it
[1:09] if you know Jesus in an intimate and
[1:12] personal way. You must have your own
[1:16] experience with God. He has no
[1:19] grandchildren.
[1:21] &gt;&gt; You've got to know him in the power of
[1:24] his resurrection. You've got to exchange
[1:27] your earth birth.
[1:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30] &gt;&gt; Your earth birth for a new birth.
[1:33] &gt;&gt; That word born again means born from
[1:36] above.
[1:37] &gt;&gt; You have had an earth birth. You have
[1:40] been birthed here in this realm. But I
[1:44] want you to know that doesn't qualify
[1:47] you for an eternal place around the
[1:49] table.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; But there is a birth.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; There is a birth that qualifies you for
[1:56] a perpetual place in that table uh uh in
[2:00] the marriage supper of the lamb. Not
[2:03] just for a thousand years of millennial
[2:05] reign, but forever a in an eternity that
[2:10] will never end. That's the birth from
[2:13] above.
[2:14] &gt;&gt; So Lord, may we all know today before we
[2:16] leave this place that we have not only
[2:19] had an earth,
[2:21] &gt;&gt; but that we have had a birth from above,
[2:23] &gt;&gt; totally born again. That means saved by
[2:27] grace through the blood. It means
[2:30] sanctified by applying the washing of
[2:33] the water of the word. And it means
[2:36] baptized,
[2:38] filled to overflowing.
[2:41] Come on.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; The difference between filled and
[2:47] baptized
[2:48] &gt;&gt; is you can fill up a cup
[2:51] &gt;&gt; and stop at the rim
[2:53] &gt;&gt; and you can say, "I fill the cup."
[2:56] That's the earnest.
[2:59] &gt;&gt; But there's something more.
[3:01] &gt;&gt; There there's that portion that that is
[3:04] added that causes the cup to overflow.
[3:09] This is a baptism
[3:12] &gt;&gt; and it's part of the new birth.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said salvation and the
[3:18] Holy Ghost baptism is not the same
[3:21] thing.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:24] &gt;&gt; But he said it requires the Holy Ghost
[3:27] baptism to complete
[3:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:32] &gt;&gt; The new birth.
[3:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. He goes on to say, "The Holy Ghost
[3:36] baptism and the new birth are not the
[3:39] same.
[3:40] &gt;&gt; But it requires a Holy Ghost baptism
[3:44] in order to complete the new birth."
[3:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:48] &gt;&gt; Water, blood,
[3:51] &gt;&gt; and then life.
[3:53] &gt;&gt; Spirit life.
[3:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:55] &gt;&gt; Completes the new birth.
