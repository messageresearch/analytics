TRANSCRIPT
========================================
because of the joy that comes when you feel the smile from within i want you to know obeying jesus is joy knowing that you're doing what the spirit bid you to do is joy unspeakable there's no room for dread there's no room for drudge in obeying god by the spirit but i want you to know jesus came to give us joy in obeying him and he said i'm going to do something for them that they never expected i'm not only going to save them by my blood but i'm going to crawl inside of them by my spirit and fill them with the goodness of me so that they can obey me with joy so that they can serve me with liberty and it doesn't mean we're wild and loose and our freedom has caused greasy grace it means we want to get closer to him live a more dedicated and more sanctified more consecrated life because of the joy that comes when you feel the smile from within oh most of us are looking for the smile from without it's because of where we've been in our life we're looking for somebody to accept us it's normal it's natural we're looking for someone to accept us we're looking for someone to agree with us someone to like us someone who's willing to be with us we're looking for a smile from without when you get it rejoice and even if you don't rejoice because that's not the smile that matters the smile that matters is the one that comes from within and i don't mean from the human spirit of man i mean from the god who lives inside of you when the father's pleasure over your life becomes an inward reality i tell you it don't matter then what goes on around you you just say i can do this thing because greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and he loves me he's not out to get me he's out to get me he's pulling me into him you
