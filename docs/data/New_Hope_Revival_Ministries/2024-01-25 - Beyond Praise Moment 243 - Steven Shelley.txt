TRANSCRIPT
========================================
when we praise we are emphasizing what God has done the horse and ride are thrown into the sea but when we worship we're not emphasizing as much what God has done we're now emphasizing who God sh who God is many people never get that far many praisers never get to worship many have not yet experienced being bathed in your own tears because you praised beyond your manhood your manliness you praised beyond your per I'm going to preach today if I have to D I'm going to preach it you praise beyond your dignity you praised beyond your reputation your staunchness your religion call it what it is it's religion you can praise with religion but real worship only takes place with [Applause] relationship so if all you have is is a religious connection to God you'll be a wonderful praiser but if if you want to move beyond the realm of Praise into the realm of worship so the glory can fall down on your head and Change Your Life Worship comes out of an overflow of a relationship of intimacy with God Almighty with our savior and bridegroom King the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua see worship is not focusing on on the might of his hand or the strength of his arm worship is is focusing on simply who he is is You're Beautiful Jesus You're Beautiful Jesus I well I'm just not comfortable calling another man beautiful then you didn't praise your way to this place because if you praised your way to this place you forgot all that stuff you quit struggling over how a man can be the bride of Christ and how a woman can be the Son of God you get woo I'm preaching yes you get all that settled in the realm of Praise so the truth is some of us haven't praised enough we ought to be looking forward to some glorious days because some of our folks have some catching up to do with their praise because if you're still thinking like that I could never tell another man he's beautiful then why don't you remember that he's not not just a man he's God Almighty and there was a time in his life and Ministry that there was no Beauty in him to be found and no comeliness but I want you to know from the Mount of transfiguration when God glorified him even the marring that took place at Calvary none of that could take away from the resurrected beauty of the glorified Christ because congregations that will not entertain the glory in the last days will be judged not in the end they'll be judged in the last days congregations that will not entertain the glory of the Lord the angel of God will come and write kabot over the door and that is the last plague brother brandom said that is spiritual death when he talks about spiritual death he's not talking about out there right he's talking among those who claim to know the truth you'll sit right on the Pew and drop and die if you're not careful because you want to fit into some kind of a of a mold that someone has created but there's going to come an hour I'm telling you I believe it with all my heart that God's no longer going to tolerate religion in his house and he's going to deal with those places that refuse to entertain the presence of the Lord
