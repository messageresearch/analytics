========================================

Description:
Pastor Steven L. Shelley’s message, “Disconnected: The Life Has Been Severed,” highlights the importance of staying spiritually connected to Christ as the true vine, emphasizing John 15. Despite an era of unparalleled technological connectivity, many feel spiritually disconnected. Pastor Shelley explores how distraction and neglect of prayer, meditation, and the Word lead to this disconnection. He encourages intentional fellowship with God through abiding in His Word, meditative study, and active faith. Drawing parallels to Peter walking on water, he illustrates the dangers of doubt and the importance of focus on Jesus, underscoring that reconnection with Him is always accessible by faith and devotion.

even understand what that means I I don't even believe in such a thing you know people always say I don't believe in this I I don't believe in leaving I don't see how in the world you can be changed by the revelation of the word and then look back to an old beggarly uh life and if you're looking to denominations you're going to be disappointed so where else can you go but hi high in him amen amen uh let's thank God for the musicians and and uh that we're just blessed we're blessed want to mention some birthdays real quick why don't you all s be seated rest a minute um sister Trisha's birthday is today her first birthday in Alabama so you got to make it special Joseph's birthday was Tuesday that he wasn't here Tuesday night for us to tell him happy birthday but they celebrated it yesterday so we'll say happy birthday to Joseph today a little bit late Wednesday is Sister Janet Miller's birthday and we want to send her lots of love today in in Arkansas and let her know that we appreciate her and she's faithful streaming and the family there and we just sent her lots of love this week and then he's out so we don't we can say whatever we want to about brother gley getting old cause he's not in it his slightly older wife said tell it and my wife is not in here either or she'd have said tell it too because this as a Friday brother gy turns 55 that's double Grace it's just a number it is you do notice it I'm not going to pretend like you don't notice it in the morning I'm 56 I ought to know but but it's just a number and there are a few months out of the year that brother gley is older than my wife and that starts Friday and she loves that time it's her favorite time of year and they they poke on one another like brother and sister but uh I I always tell this we were at Youth Camp in in uh in West Milton Ohio so many years ago and brother gley had I actually met brother gy before he married sister Joyce and Nathan had been born Nathan's not feeling well today he's streaming Nathan had been born and he was a wee little one it seemed seemed like in brother G's big old hand say it again sister he had was seven weeks old well he was little then and brother greedy was at that Youth Camp I was speaking and uh he had he had Nathan and he was kind of holding holding him in a little football hold you know like that and brother gy looked about 12 and there was some sisters some busy busy sisters I'll just say busy sisters all right I'll leave out some of it who got really worried about the way that that little boy was holding his little brother so they come down to where I was sitting they said brother shelle would you please say something to that boy for the way he's holding his little brother I said well sure sisters I'll be glad to go say something to him but the reality is that's not his little brother that's his son and I guess he can hold him any way he wants to and they said well that boy didn't look like he would be big enough to be married much old enough to be married much less have a have a baby boy well he's looking a little closer to his age these days I feel lots of Liberty with him not in here but I will tell you that he is a man of the highest Integrity I know he got the character from Jesus but he had a great example in his dad his dad Pastor a church in his 80s how old is pop grandp somebody tell 80 you remember 82 or 83 and we saw a clip on social media of him climbing down knee replacement now went through a terrible time climbing down in the baptistry to baptize somebody just a couple Sundays ago still pastoring still going on still preaching the end time message and brother gley has been a great great man of character and strength to this church for a long long time and he's I think he's going to be out of town on his birthday uh but do what you can to show him love you can you can press some money in his hand and tell him to buy himself a meal or whatever you feel to do but he is uh he's the real deal and I I hope that we're both alive at Rapture and I hope I'm on his Cloud I hope I'm right next to him because he has certainly stood stood very close to me through all of these years most faithful friend that I've ever had and I'm thankful for him today not just on his birthday but always well let's hear the word let's get there would you stand again you've been up and down but would you get up again and turn with me again if you will to John chapter 15 I want to say with brother gley how nice it is to have sister Laurel's family I it's been a long time since I've seen her brother Lance and his wife sister Judy and I have to say that as the years have come you you I don't remember you looking quite as much like Mark as you do now but you really really looking back it really maybe your wife would say you're the you're the better looking version of Mark I I don't know I it wouldn't be appropriate for me to say but it certainly brings back lots of good memories seeing you all here today John 15 and verse one Jesus all read letters I am the True Vine and my my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you verse four abide in me and I in you now if Jesus is telling us us his disciples then his bride now that we should abide in him and he in us then we must have something to do with allowing him to abide in us because he said abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide abide in the vine no more can ye except ye read it abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit thank God for without me this is so so incredibly true it's true today it'll be true tomorrow for without me ye you can do do you know we might would say little not much Jesus just cut to the Chase and he said you need to know you can't do anything without me and I believe him if a man abide not in me and he has cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned and then John 157 which we heard brother brandham quoting so many many times if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what ye will blank check and it shall be done there is a blank check there he said but there's a prerequisite on the blank check and that is if you abide in me and you allow my words to abide in you then you shall ask and what what whatsoever you ask it shall be done if you believe that say Amen father we come before you today with a grateful heart you have been so good so faithful to your children you are still Jehovah Rafa the Healer and you said I heal all of your diseases and infirmities and we stand on that today we stand on that with our eyes on you we stand on that Lord I pray again for those streaming this service today in the nations of the world who could not be here and even some local ones who are streaming who are sick in body or else have just come through something and and they wanted to do do us a favor and and uh try to slow down the spread of anything but we ask that you touch them today the same Jesus that walks Among Us in this hour in this house Lord you can walk into their home you can move for them you can raise them up and we're not just concerned about symptoms but go to the root of whatever these infirmities are and bring healing we pray Lord let your word come forth today with Clarity and let it accomplish all that it is sent forth to do and we will give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name above every name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the saint said you may be seated we're continuing this morning a little series on disconnection the life has been severed this is the most connected hour that we have ever known as sojourners here on planet Earth amen the there's never been another time like this hour where people are so connected I am standing here this morning and I remember that that chilly apartment up in the church in Columbus so many years ago uh there was a blank screen sister Alfreda on the computer we didn't have we didn't have all the back lit fancy fancy screens that we have today it was just a blank screen black screen and one little blipping dot just beeping and I'll never forget it Kevin McGregor's on the other end of the line and he's this this was this was pre iMessage days this was there were no iPhones I hadn't even got my bag phone yet this was this was antique times the kids call it you know and and I'll never forget what it felt like when he types a message and that little bleeping dot begin to form letters and go across the screen he said hello brother Shelly from Frozen Edmonton I jumped up and down like a silly little child because there had been no iMessage there was no texting then email was just beginning and I thought wow we are connected if I want to say I mean I didn't know what to say back all of a sudden I was speechless I didn't even know what to type and I I I think I think we answered back well well hello brother from from the baly south or something like that and little did we know that just 25 30 plus 35 or too many years ago and now we're in a time where we can speak to someone anywhere in the world there's never been a more connected hour than the one we're we're in now the list of social media Outlets is getting longer every day and people are getting sucked in to the rabbit hole of being being connected and yet we have people who say I I'm feeling so disconnected spiritually I I I'm just feeling numb even this week I had a dear friend of mine sitting across the table who said to me brother I love this message I love this word I love this truth but but I'm I'm feeling cold I'm just not I'm just not feeling alive I'm not feeling a fire a passion that I have felt and it's it's not just his reality but it's the reality of so many people that we hear from around the world I just feel disconnected from him well I want you to understand he never hangs up the call he never ghosts us when we need him he he never refuses he's not even like some of you who never bother to answer a text you're you're so spiritual that you can't even send a thumbs up you know uh but he he won't ever ghost you that way he'll never he'll never let you communicate one-sided he'll always let you know that I'm on the other end of The Kite string even when you can't see me even when you can't feel me even when it's only every now and again that you feel the tug on the other end of the line but you'll know he's there because his word said so and we can count on what his word has said if you believe that amen so if we're feeling disconnected and sometimes we do this is not to to condemn you or to judge you or even to blame you but who else are we going to blame if we can't blame him because he said I'll always be with you I'll go with you even to the end of the world we know he'll never leave us he'll never forsake us then if we're dis connected who hung up who ghosted who who forgot to stay connected to the vine he said if you abide in me and my words abide in you and and that means there there that if is there it's that small little word that says you've got to do this there is a prerequisite there is a requirement in this hour and even though the book is opened and even though the revelation we have from God is Rich there's still the possibility that in the midst of all of this revelation we hang up or we somehow disconnect ourselves from fellowship with him listen church God is not just about relationship he's also about fellowship and if you don't believe that just remember he came down in the cool of the evening he was already Papa he was already God to Adam and to Eve but now he wanted to be in fellowship with them it's a reason why the God above us became a god with us and eventually a God in us because he was looking for fellowship and so when we replace him with all of the other pretties in life and with all of the other distractions in life then it's really us who pushes him to the back of the closet it's really us who says I don't have time to read today I don't have time to pray today well I want you to know if you don't read every day if you don't pray every day if you don't hear even a small portion of the word every day it won't take a week to be disconnected but I want you to remember that at the end of this study I want you to know that it's just as easy to reconnect it's just as e he's as close as the mention of his name he's as close as the opening of his word he's as close as is listening to a tape he's just that close you just have to focus on him you have to turn your attention away from all the other things in life that grab us in this hour and you have to set aside time for him your time with him is more important than the time with your boyfriend or your girlfriend or your husband or your wife or your siblings come on it's more important than your Christmas meal Fellowship with him abiding in him and him abiding in you we've already talked about in this series that one of the ways the scripture tells us that we can make sure that his words abide in US is by not only reading his word but meditating on his word I think we've clarified already in this series that it's not it's not transcendental uh meditation it's not Eastern mysticism meditation it's not yoga and and all of the spookies that go with that that we're talking about we're talking about biblical meditation and in the scripture remember uh the the the verses especially in Psalms are very clear uh Psalm 77:12 I will meditate also of all thy Work and talk of thy doings Psalm 19:14 let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my strength and my redeemer and we found out that in Hebrew the word meditate there means to utter a sound it means to to moan to to to to meditate to mutter what a strange word what a strange meaning to mutter but how many of you find yourself muttering to yourself uh what that mean and I I'm so happy that the scriptures are clear here in the Hebrew because I want you to know something we know from brain science that you just forming the words with your mouth as you read you don't even have to vocalize them but you're just reading here you have you ever done that is Grandpa the only one that's ever done that I remember my grandfather doing that reading the paper not only that the new the newspaper you know what that is and it rink I can hear him I can shut my eyes right now and hear my papa opening up the newspaper when he went to put it away he made sure that every section was in and he and he did it on the arm of the chair and got it all packed up together and and and I can hear him now that thin newspaper and I can he would put his hand behind it like that and I can hear him pointing putting his finger on the newspaper and pointing at something as he muttered along reading to himself what he was reading in his mind and brain science tells us that that takes our memory and our comprehension with understanding to another level so the meaning is not just to read to yourself and meditate and think on on it but it's also as you're reading let you let your at least your lips form the words and perhaps if possible maybe you'd even make a little sound or you might go as far as I do sometimes sitting in my office I just read it aloud if it's going to help me remember it if it's going to help me understand it if it's going to help me to keep my mind on the Lord and his words abiding in me I'll just read it out loud if it's appropriate to do so and if if it's not I just might do it anyway I might just sit down on a bench in the mall and just start reading it out loud you never know you just never know you could probably draw a crowd sir so the word meditate is is the act of thoughtful deliberation with the implication of it's very spiritual to talk to yourself I can prove it to you right here now brother brandham tells us and we've read this one already in presuming but let's look at it again he said you know I I heard someone was in a meeting here some time ago someone said just let your mind go blank now just look right straight up towards the sky let your mind go blank you'll get an experience oh dear he said and no doubt but what you do that's right but you get an experience but what an experience you see when you do that you just open your soul mind will and emotion to Satan he'll give you something that's true he said but I think a person coming to Christ should come with all the intelligence they got and quoting in their mind when they come to him every promise in the scripture brother bandom said keep your mind Al alert not idle alert when you come when you come to Christ don't let it go blank the devil will make you do anything see there give you a sensation he can do that too but you want an experience something that the Bible teaches something that's real now don't misunderstand he's not teaching us against a real spiritual experience he's just saying you want the kind that's grounded in the Bible you want the kind that's in the word you don't want to let your mind go blank and have some Demon talk to you you want to come meditating on the word he said then they go away presuming well a little nerve Shook and I saw a light or something like that I got it and they never here's the key if you want somebody to have any confidence in your experience with the Lord number one let it be based in the word number two Let it cause you to live higher let it cause you to live different than you were living before it's the fruit it's the fruit that testifies of the reality of the experience even if it's rooted and grounded in scripture he said they never live any different they just go right on out don't you let that be your habit don't let that happen to you so we discovered many things about true meditation and then on Tuesday night we looked at Philippians chapter 4: 6-9 he said be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God Amen and the peace of God here it is for every troubling thought for every moment of anxiety for every worry for every unnecessary concern let the peace of God which passes passes all understanding it will keep your hearts not your blood pump but the Lev in Hebrew the the the seat of all human emotion and your mind through Christ Jesus how is our mind kept through Christ Jesus in peace in Shalom now remember about that word Shalom you know people know it from Modern Hebrew as only a greeting but I want to say hello in in Israel we say shalom and when you're departing you say shalom shalom double double greeting and that's all that people understand about Shalom but the reality is it's really a question when someone greets you and says Shalom they're really asking you in Hebrew how is your peace Shalom how is your peace and you say you usually answer in modern Hebrew anyway you would say beset and beset means order in order so how is your peace and you would answer in order now we can say that as part of the Bride because our peace is not dependent on circumstances we can be in the middle of a storm and have peace because our peace is more than a feeling it's the presence of a person Jesus is our peace and so no matter what's going on our answer can be in order how is your your peace mine is in order because my peace comes from the reality of having Jesus Christ Living inside of me so we know that finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise would you help me with reading the rest of that think on these things you're not going to find those things in the news you're not going to find those things on Facebook Instagram any of the other you're not going to find those things there most of the time you're only going to find those virtuous holy pure lovely things in God's word if you abide in me Jesus said and my words abide in you so keep the word of God ever before you it's not religious to have scripture in your home it's right it's right it's a good idea to remind yourself I've got all kinds of little notes and and stickies and everything else around my work area I want to remind myself even I can forget sometime one phone call can disturb your peace one text can send you into a tail spin come on but if you've got the word ever before you and you're letting that word abide in you then God's fruit's going to come out of that of that relationship and out of that Fellowship so these are lovely things he said those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace the God of Peace in Hebrew SAR Shalom the Prince of Peace shall be with you if you believe that he is then say Amen doesn't matter what's going on around you so one of the ways is to read and study God's word and study as a part of that meditation read and study the scripture well I'm not a preacher that's not my job no it's your privilege it may not be your job it's your privilege we're not we're not Roman Catholic where the the book is in a language that the common man can't even understand God has preserved the word for you in a language that you can comprehend and if you don't put your face in that book then you need not spend any time doing anything else and study means look at it carefully you don't have to be a scholar you don't have to be a linguist you don't have to understand Biblical Hebrew or Greek you can get you a Webster's Dictionary and the spirit of Truth when you're filled with the spirit of Truth you take the Bible look up a word you don't understand and brother you can get somewhere and we should do that as Believers oh my well didn't what about a sister I didn't think she was supposed to handle the word brother brandom is talking about you trying to use that word to straighten someone else out you have every right to take that book up for yourself not so that you can preach it your husband but so that you can line up with it every right to every spiritual gift don't let that slip from you and then one of the other Keys is to focus you would think that you'd never have to tell somebody the importance of focusing on something but we're in an hour now where we have to really focus I I think modern language they they say things like being conscience you you've got to be in the moment you've got to be present someone said that sounds weird to me it doesn't to me because I've had enough conversations with people who physically are in the room I'm preaching to you physically their body is in the room but their mind is somewhere else it's on some Netflix series or something you know they're they're either thinking about what they would rather be doing or they're thinking about what they're going to say to you what their answer is going to be so they're not really listening to you so this is an hour where uh you know we used to kind of make ADHD a a a uh you know a small group of people but now we realize that most everybody in our lives is on the Spectrum come come on I I mean really does anyone know anybody that doesn't show a little bit of the signs of I don't and that's elderly all the way down to little ones and we're doing that yes we're doing that if you don't like what you read you just thumb it sir you just scroll it when we come to God's house there's no room to scroll we have to take what we like and we have to take what cuts us a little bit when we're going to make sure that the word of God abides in us we're going to sit down and study a little bit going to read it a little bit we've got to let it be our Focus we've got to be present we've got to be ious of what we're doing if we're going to hear a tape we need to set aside some time now this doesn't mean that you can't let the word play while you're doing something else because even sleeping your subconscious mind can pick up some of those truths but if you really want to grow from the word that you're looking at you've got to focus on that word which means to be extremely diligent in your efforts to tune out distractions oh it's quiet are you distracted and focus fully on what you're reading or on the message that you're listening to if possible make some notes did you know that's another brain science reinforcement did you know writing it down will help you to remember and going back and revisiting that between 24 and 48 hours will cause that little piece of inform to be deeper wired in the hypoc campus of the brain I mean you know it it amazes me sometimes because brother brandom taught us these things throughout the message particularly in the message the greatest battle ever fought and most of brother brandom's Ministry took place in a time where brain science did not believe in neuroplasticity meaning that people believed even scientists in those days believe you are you are stuck with the brain that you're born with you can't improve it you can't take away from it age will eventually cause you to lose cells along the way but there's no changing of the brain so brother brandom is talking about claiming the promises of God and speaking them out loud over and over and over again and somebody said even if you even if you don't feel it or what feeling what does feeling have to do with it he said he said in fact just keep say even if you don't see any manifestation of it just keep I'm Healed I am healed well well you know what he's he is teaching us the power of Faith but he's also teaching us the ability to rewire our brain to stop listening to symptoms and start holding on to God sir in faith the next thing you know he said you just keep saying that I'm Healed I'm Healed I'm Healed and he said before long faith kicks in and God causes your body sir to obey the confession that has come out of your mouth is anybody with me this is our Authority this is what God's given to the bride the the ability and while doing that we are rewiring our brain toward Faith we're pulling it away from doubt we're pulling it away from darkness and anxiety and we're creating a new environment does that sound too weird if it does I apologize that you're that far behind but we've been studying this for years now and you know what I sent a little text out on for Friday you'd be surprised how many answers I got from people who said I'm practicing this and I'm finding out that it works it doesn't just work some of the time it works all the time if you'll remain extremely diligent and you'll just confess that word you'll just conf when that negative thought comes before you let that whole negative story unfold in your mind if you'll pull that thing down like the scripture tells us to do and force it under the blood of Jesus Christ and then form a better thought I'm Healed you don't have to be you know you don't have to be brilliant about it I'm I'm Healed we wake up with a new symptom what do we do we run to Google we see what Dr Google says someone told me this weekend my office I had such and such a syndrome I said I shouldn't have went to Google when Benjamin was a little boy and and we didn't go to Google there was no Google to go to I don't guess we went to a doctor we went to a pediatrician for his regular little checkup and that was before they divorced us because we wouldn't take all of every every piece of advice they had we wouldn't take it and and so they just finally cancelled us we were the beginning of the cancel culture they just canel us you can't come back here anymore I was all right he was a little flaky anyway we he's in Benjamin's in there for a regular checkup and and he and he looked at him and he said my his eyes look a little gray the the whites of his eyes look a little gray he said did you know that that this is the doctor now the one taking the money I'm not going to mention that he was from Canada so it's my wife and she he said his eyes look mighty gr he said did you know that's early signs of brittle bone disease no no we didn't know that we didn't know that but I don't believe it told my wife all the way home he doesn't have brittle bone disease don't even let that come in our mind anymore brittle bone disease no way I didn't get to go to the doctor every time but a few times later he's back for those aggravating checkups you know can I just call you when I need you that's that's my that's my doctor approach and they know it they laugh when they see me coming you must be sick but isn't that what a doctor's for anyway uh I was back a few months later and I said to him I said well you know you mentioned when we were in here and that his eyes were gray and that it could be a sign of brittle bone disease are you going to test him are you going to check him I mean we don't believe he has it but are you going to make oh he said no no no it can mean a lot of other things too so so you know stay away from Google and stay away from googly doctors sometime sometime a a and and and go with faith right no matter what they say you appreciate them thank God for them we are not against doctors we're not against medicine we're not in suggesting that you should be we're just saying a lot of times a bad report will put you in fear and anxiety and you're going to have to come back and get prayer anyway so you might as well start off from the beginning I am healed regardless of what I have I am healed Hallelujah he's sitting in the barber chair I am healed I want to tell you the Church of Christ Barber you know I am healed he said well you don't look healed he said vs I know you still had to feel your way to get in the chair he said I'm Healed I am healed I am healed and all of a sudden let me say I don't believe in such as that you ought to you ought to believe in it the next thing you know he's halfway down the block yes sir seeing healed and here come the little Church of Christ Barber behind him God knows how to make a Believer out of your neighbor praise God so you get in that word let that word be your focus you know this I know this is 101 but we need it we need to be reminded you have a choice let me tell you something folks you have a choice of what you focus on the government doesn't own your ability to focus you can focus on God's word if you choose to that's right you don't have to hear a negative report too you can hang up you can tell somebody I've heard enough I've got to focus on the word of God and as we focus he opens our understanding and that word understanding to consider and carefully Ponder how God is speaking about himself even the world and personally to your heart understanding comes by Spirit the spirit of Truth opens the word to you individually we're not talking about Doctrine now we're talking about personal connection to the vine am sir that's right if you're not connected to the vine there's no life flowing into you right now brother brandom tells us in the message the mark of the beast is that too old of a sermon for you to get anything out of it's not for me 54 paragraph 171 he said there is how it come in there is how it goes out exactly a bowing and a forcing to a half he bowing excuse me and a forcing to a half Heathen religion and God stepping in the in the crucial hour and writing in unknown tongues and the man interprets it how many of you know he's in Daniel he could interpret he didn't he he didn't know that language nobody else knowed it but he had the same holy ghost that led him interpret that it's the same holy ghost in the church today he said you call it fanaticism where are you going with this just hang on you call it fanaticism I'll admit they got a lot of it but brother but brother but brother there but brother there's a real one there too I'm weary of someone who always talks about only the fanaticism and never stops to mention that the Pentecostal skies are full of the genuine we're not talking about Pentecost as a denomination we're talking about Pentecost as an experience and that's why brother brandom said well I'm Pentecostal from the top of my head to the souls of my feet not connected to an organization but have had an experience [Music] you've met the pillar of fire he said the devil throws every counterfeit he can right in the way why to confuse you and if you don't think no more here's the key this is big and if you don't think no more of God then get down and read your Bible and pray and ask God then it goes to show make sure you're looking you're not very interested in your soul in your spiritual life are you awake yes you see so we don't just need it when we got a question or when we got a problem we need his word all the time and if you can't take time to get down and pray about something or look at God's word and see what the answers are you're not very interested brother vandom said you're not very interested in your soul is anybody interested in your inner man he said move right on out there and say God I don't care how many Old Crow baites you put out there I see your Bible says it and I'm determined that's right you promised it to me the Seed of Abraham he said God called you you'll come to it Hallelujah but if you're not I don't care how religious you are you're gone that's all you can't come no man can except he called you and he's not willing that any should perish listen to what brother brandom's telling him this is in Jeffersonville he said no man except he called you and he's not willing that any should perish but a lot of you will sounds to me like there was more than one indictment this sounds like an indictment here he said but a lot of you will because you're too unconcerned eared about it your soul your inner life if you're concerned about it you're going to spend some time in prayer and it's not a Santa Claus list it's a renewing of your commitment to Christ it's renewing your fellowship with him did you know prayer doesn't always have to be about asking for anything did you know there's a portion of our prayer that can just simp be thank you it can be praised but it's open communication with him and if we're concerned about abiding in the vine we're going to have to pray a little but I know the message but I know that I'm secure and I know I'm elected and I know I'm predestinated and I'm full of bride pride and all that goes with it but yet you say sometime I feel disconnected as though God God has decided to to hang up on you no no no it's us it's us are you still here enticing Spirits he said would you raise your hand somebody that didn't raise their hand a while ago he said God bless you Sister give us a little cord while we're have our heads bowed how how much do you really mean it he said don't play now this is not a playing time he said this is a receiving time this is a time that you must get it and then he said come dump it out right now he said will you come give all you got to God he said say God I I ain't got very much I'm just a little housewife I can't do very much Lord but I can read your Bible I can pray every day I can throw out all the trash that's in my mind brother sister that'll keep anybody busy man or woman read a little bit pray a little bit and keep the trash hauled out of your mind that will occupy the biggest majority of your spiritual life because we've come to the last battle and the last battle is not against the denomination the last battle is the one that takes place here not just in the church but in the bride greatest battle ever fought it's happening even now fear anxiety depression all kinds of mental illness trying to come in and set you at disease disease that's what disease does it takes us out of ease out of peace and it sets us at disease you don't have to settle for that you can overcome because you're connected to the Vine and the vine is where we find our overcoming strength I'm dumping it out I don't want it he said I you can pray every day I I'm guilty of a lot of things that preacher said this morning so I'm dumping it out today I don't want it God fill me with love fill me with the thing that makes me love the bitterest enemy it's crickets in here that's how you know that you're praying and your reading and your Revelation has done something for you your experience has helped you it's changed you because now you're learning to love and remember that's not love in word only because real love is not just manifested in word it's manifested In Deed need are you here when you start loving the bitterest enemy of God I really want it Lord then you know you're making some progress here I want to read this to you and you're going to find in just a moment something else to criticize so get ready charity but I'm going to read first Matthew chapter 14 beginning in verse 22 and straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitudes away and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone so now he's prayed all day [Music] long he was there alone the evening is here the beginning of a new Hebrew day on the calendar he was there alone but the ship was now in the midst in the middle of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was has anybody been facing any contrary winds all of us I'm sure the wind was was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night nine hours have passed since Jesus said I'll go on to the other side I'll see you in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea you surely know that's not metaphoric he was there and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear you know anytime someone sees Jesus in a way they've never seen him before there's always a question let me tell you something Jesus is not offended by your questions just don't let your questions move you into doubt know that it's him know that he's there know that he's always present they cried out for fear in verse 27 but but straight way Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and guess what somebody took him at his word there's always going to be somebody that takes God at his word and Peter answered him and said Lord if if if if if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water if this is a ghost this is a spirit I have no desire to walk with it on the water but if this is the Lord I want to get out there he said come and Jesus said come this one red word in the midst of the of the of the black on your page and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying come on Lord save me and immediately I I I want you to notice that there's so much language here in this did you know Matthew is the only one of the gospels that records that Peter walked on the water both Mark and John tell about the storm but they don't mention Peter walking on the water does that mean he didn't no it means that each each writer wrote the thing that was you know prevalent in their mind under the inspiration of the Holy Holy Spirit but I don't I don't throw it out because only one of the gospels mentions it this is too powerful immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and and what and what did Jesus do he caught him you know what that means it means he wasn't over his head it means he hadn't sunk to the Bottom of the Sea it means that before he could ever go down all the way down Jesus caught him and he moved immediately he didn't say this would be a good time to teach Peter a lesson that's what your pastor might say well let's just see how he does down there sputtering around in the water but the B ible said immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore D thou doubt and when they were come into the ship the wind then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying isn't it amazing they're they're in total fear Fe all of them the storm is horrendous and now a ghostlike figure is appearing to them on the water and now Peter's overboard there's a whole lot going on in a few minutes time now Peter and our Lord are on the boat and they're not shaking in fear anymore or mocking Peter they're worshiping him and saying of a truth Thou Art the Son of God if we didn't believe it before we believe it now after nine hours had passed Peter began to mutter where is Jesus I thought he was going to meet us their hearts were hardened and calloused by all of the things that they had been going through all of the persecution that was tightening in they had gathered up 12 baskets one for each to disciple in the miracle of the loaves every stroke of the ore would fasten their eyes upon the evidence of his power the fish that God always provided at the right time but they were blinded by their own Sweat by their own labor by their own work men and women who focus on the darkness become like the darkness that they focus on they cry I can't live this way I can't give that much but behind every excuse is simply a lack of Desire the Lord now brings a requirement to his people not by the letter but by the spirit he summons arise get out of the boat walk on my word during the fourth and final watch King Jesus goes for a stroll on the tops of the watery Billows he showed up that night in a form they had never seen before they shrieked in fear only Peter had the courage to even ask Lord is that you if so bid me come his faith had been stirred by the revelation of who the king really was remember he had met him in Bonas cesaria Philippi whom to men say that I the son of man am some say th th John the Baptist or Elias or one of the prophets come back from the dead who do you say that I the son of man am Thou Art the Messiah Thou Art the Christ you are the anointed one and here remember this folks he says something that wasn't even a part of second temple theology very few people were believing in the time of Jesus that Messiah would be God and they had no real concept of God having a son so Peter didn't get this at the synagogue he didn't get this in the Bible School Jesus told him you didn't get this from mama or daddy Flesh and Blood hath not revealed this unto thee he said Thou Art the Christ the Messiah the Son of the Living God the disciples are probably looking around God has a son but Peter had it by Revelation Flesh and Blood didn't reveal this unto thee it is of my Father in Heaven Thou Art Peter Petra small Stone it indicates one chipped off of a larger rock that little piece of gravel is not enough for the church to be built on and yet Jesus said Thou Art blessed art thou Simon son of Jonah for flesh and blood but my Father which is in heaven Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my church and the gates of hell shall not Prevail against it not on that little piece of gravel but on the solid rock of Revelation so Peter's already had some great experience and he's riding high on what God is revealed to him his faith had been stirred and Jesus had said it is I the Greek construction of these words here it's egoi and it literally means I am interesting I am Jesus answers and the words that are recorded in the King James are the Greek words not for it is I but I am and isn't that who he announced himself to be to Moses I am that I am so Jesus said is it is it you Lord is it you Lord if it's you bid me come he said I am the same God who sent Moses to Pharaoh is now walking across the water that night same God remember Jehovah of the old Jesus of the new Jesus Christ The Mystery of God revealed at first there was an if in Peter's words if it's you after all it still dark out there the grizzled fishermen were quite aware of the sea they knew the daughters they knew this was a big one he's now invited to step out of the safe place and into that which was totally unprecedented and he began to sling one leg over the side I can almost hear his fishing budding say oh my he's going to do it they didn't understand that he wasn't just walking on water he was walking on a word a word said come he heard it come I may not be able to walk on water but I can walk on a word as long as it comes from him if he said come then he's going to take care of me if I sink he's going to catch me if I drown he's going to revive me I'm not going to worry about how it turns out I'm just going to know that in the end he's I am Hallelujah he's still able and I'm going to step out I I I I've got a word I've got a word I've got a word nobody has a word like this little bride that we can stand on not just when things are good but when they're hellish when hounds of hell are against you when your family's falling apart when your children are backslid and running after the world when your body is failing you that's the hour to step out on the word hallelujah make sure you sir just trying not to be that's how I feel sister Flo wo that's when we need that's when we need him in moments like these remember I told you the other day I saw where brother Chris Kathy's wife was that a I I never mentioned it to him texting with him last night I should have mentioned it but she was at a Collingsworth concert and was sitting by a woman the woman introduced herself and it was the daughter of the woman who wrote the song in times like these we need an anchor that's where we are and we got it we don't have to go hunting him we don't have to go looking for him we know where he is as long as we've stayed connected as long as we've kept his word in us we're not know it alls so never have to look at it again never have to pray for deeper understanding again we're not people who are lazy and we depend on our pastors to do it all that's right we've learned what's available to us but what if i s Lord this was a sink or swim moment for Peter he's now invited to step out of his safe place and into that which was totally unprecedented buddies you know oh he's going to do it he's going to Peter of course it's Peter showbo Peter of course it's him what if I sink Lord have you ever asked him a similar question what if I sink Lord what if I say I'm heal and it doesn't go away now what if I testify that I'm Healed and I get worse don't you know that if he immediately moved to rescue Peter and he caught him before he was drowned caught him before he was under don't you know that if you'll step out on his word he'll catch you too that's right yes sir and when we look at that word caught he caught him verse 31 that word is a compound of again of two Greek words EPI and lambano and it means upon to take hold of and to seize it doesn't mean that Jesus just you know delicately with light touch of fingers just you know caresses him into the boat it means means he seized upon him it means he grabbed him with great determination perhaps even a little violence to someone looking on because there's a time to be pretty and there's a time to be serious and Jesus knew this is a serious moment for Peter Cuz if I let him go he's going to keep looking at the wind and the wave and he's going to find the Bottom of the Sea of Galilee pretty soon he's going to swim like a rock I'm sure of it so quickly he seized on him took a hold of him let me tell you something Jesus will always reach down always reach down to embrace you we're always safe when he is near would you cut the lights please if a movie offends you you can slip out now I'm obeying the Lord I've had critics all my life watch this 8 minutes 7 minutes [Music] Simon we're not getting anywhere the winds are too strong we should turn back we can get there just keep growing Simon it's the fourth watch of the night that we've been stuck in the same place for [Music] hours

everybody stop stop stop slop move that's it's not a ghost are you [Music] crazy don't be afraid it's me Jesus [Music] impossible how is this the second most incredible thing I've seen today this surprises you did you learn nothing from today if it is you command me to come to you on the water Simon no are you out of your mind if you are who you say you are Bid me to step out of this boat you have the faith to walk on this water absolutely you can do whatever you command and if you command the to hold me I will walk on it if I call you to me you will step out in faith yes then why are you upset why are you chasing after Gentiles when your own people have problems right here when your own person has problems I've been right here in front of you believing in you but you're breaking up fights in the theopolis then come to to me you weary and heavy laden I will give you rest Simon no Simon don't be foolish Simon Simon wait Simon dog Simon what are you doing Simon Simon where are you

blessed bless are you Lord our god king of the universe who gives and takes away why do you think I allowed trials I don't know they prove the genuiness of your faith they strengthen you this is strengthening you and Eden keep your eyes on me who comforts us in our grief and bindes up the wounds of the [Music] Brokenhearted Wars with us for the life that is not [Music] [Music] be I'm sinking Lord s I'm sinking in The Shadow of Your Wings do we take refuge [Music] come on help me please [Music] [Music] don't go I got you I got you let me go I got you please oh you have little faith why did you doubt don't let me go I have much planned for you Simon including hard things just keep your eyes on me my [Music] promise son come on help him help please don't let me go please I'm sorry pleas don't let me go please I'm sorry please don't peace be still I wanted you to see that part it's very hard to see because it's it's supposed to be in the dark that's perhaps what it would have been like I know there's additional language and I know that this is someone's thoughts of how it could be portrayed and if you get caught up in that you'll miss the point the point is this don't let me go that's what I wanted you to see don't let me go now in this in this The Chosen Peter's going through something his wife is going through something they've taken some Liberty it's okay with me but I want to know exactly what happened I go to the Bible right but for me the visual Peter's struggling he's had a revelation he's still struggling have you had a revelation do you ever struggle come on don't be religious be real sure we struggle it's you is it you and he's angry he's carrying some anger have you ever carried any as a Christian as a Believer have there been circumstances in your life that just made you angry you didn't know who to be angry with and sometimes we even take it out on the Lord as though he's the one who did it and that's a little bit of what's going on here but Peter finds his faith he gets out of the boat and once he sees what it's like to be without him he knows I can never be without him again what speaks to me in that scene is it's not the details of the conversation but once he's back in the boat Jesus is going to stand up and calm the storm and Peter won't turn him loose do what you got to do but don't let me go don't let me go don't let me go that's what I'm preaching if you abide in me and my words abide in you you've got the check it's an abiding it's a continuing it's a don't let me go that's what it is in the message and I'm coming to a close at Thy word Lord I saw that this was preached in Wood River Illinois so it made me think of all the precious Saints we've known from Wood River all of them with the Lord ports with the Lord sister Carolyn W Wason with the Lord brother and sister uh their names Kesler brother and sister Kesler with the Lord from Wood River they were in this meeting I think of Peter when the Lord told him said come walking on the waters why Peter never walked on the water never heard of anybody else walking on water I don't know how to walk on water Lord but at Thy word you do notice that brother brandom's adding a little word or two there so don't get offended at the at the clip but at Thy word here I come and look at what it said and he did he did in the message perfect Faith musicians will you slip this way Peter he was doing all right to got scared the word told him he could walk on the water he was scared first he thought it was a ghost He said Lord if it be you bid me come on the Water Peter he was said come on now that's just the same as James 5:14 same as Mark 16 the same God said it said come on brother Bam's reminding us the one who said come is the one who made the these other precious promises so he started walking he done all right got down out of the ship started walking there was a storm on the sea you know Great White Cap waves bigger than these hills around here foam breaking on top of them terrific maybe 15 20 feet foam the White Caps breaking and it was a terrific thing for him to ask if it Be You Lord see he looked there looked like a shadow or a spirit pretty similar because I know what you were thinking in your mind what I was thinking in my mind there's a storm going on and then an amazing Spotlight Out of Heaven shining on Jesus so he lights up the water that's not the way brother random saw it that's not the way the film saw it he's walking in the shadow he's not announcing all that he is he's just coming he said look like a adow or Spirit he said if it's you bid me come to you on the water Jesus said come on on and he stepped down and said it's the Lord I'll just walk but when he got his eyes on the waves he got scared what come in his mind first thing I'm going to walk because the word said for me to walk the first thing was the right thing and then the next thing he looked at his symptoms he looked out there and seen how big them waves was he got scared and when he did down he went see what he feared happened let's not pass over that what he feared happened what he believed happened when he believed he could walk my my my my my my my when he believed and got scared in his belief yeah faith is the substance when he got scared in his belief then his substance substance left him see he still professed his faith but he didn't H oh I've been there I've been there don't you sit smug like you've never been there your faith knew what was right right but your symptoms and your circumstances were howling against you he got scared in his belief his substance left him he still professed his faith but he didn't have the substance the substance would have went right over the top of that white cap and went right on to him see if he has the perfect Faith see but he didn't have it he thought he did he did it first he was willing to venture right out why the Lord told me to do it it's going to happen got to happen so he just steps right down out of the boat and takes off he never thought about the waves how contrary they was he never got that in his mind now when you get to thinking that's it we could stop the quote there when you get to thinking you go to sinking take that home with you when you go to thinking that's when you go to sinking he said well now waitting you know I've been sick so long stop you might just well go back to the boat see but when you quit thinking about that sir about what about the wind about the rain about the wave about the backslid Sun about the Wayward Daughter about some little something going on in the church about the guy on the job that's out to get you when you go to thinking you might as well go back to the boat and then in the in the message the resurrection of gyrus his daughter don't ever pass that one when you come to it you should hear it again and again and again and again all of them but all my this that is so sweet in paragraph 37 Peter asked him one night if it be you bid me come to you on the water and Jesus said come that's all Peter had to hear come he jumped out of the boat started running to meet him and even on his road when fear comes he saw the big waves the Big White Caps burst in probably as high as this building he got scared and as soon as he got scared dot dot dot see he got his mind off of what Christ said what' Christ say come do you really think that he's going to invite you into the midst of turmoil if he's not going to be there to catch you come he got scared like we do sometime he got his eyes on the symptoms he got to thinking and he began sinking oh Jesus if I can hold on to you I can have confidence that you're going to hold on to me I've mentioned this a lot lately tell me Mr brandom how did you hold on to your religion he's standing out there on the hill in the cemetery his wife is buried Sharon Rose buried there's nobody walking out from behind the tree this day he is as low as he can be in Emotion his circumstances are ugly his storm is great the government man man representative sees him standing out there on the you've ever been to the cemetery you know that sister Pope's grave is right on the highway almost just up the just up the hill you saw him standing there he got out walked up that way iser was his name wasn't it something like that tell me Billy how did you hold on to your religion walking through these dark places oh he said I didn't it held on to me Peter's in the boat don't let me go don't let me go I didn't know that charity I was preaching about it last Sunday she pulled it up but I didn't see the text I didn't know I just showed it to you then we talked about Peter in the film I don't know how real Peter looked but in the film if you could have seen he's short he had a little bit of short person syndrome he had big biceps that he wanted to show all the time you know he's a fisherman he's pretty confident a little arrogant but faithful loyal ready to fight for Jesus in the film they have him going through a personal crisis that's where it gets real when the enemy touches your wife when the enemy touches your child that's when it gets personal that's when the battle comes home and Peter struggling just seemed like the Lord wasn't doing enough for his situation in the film but that old strong masculine banty rooster Peter you know in that moment he realized that what Jesus said in John 15 was so true without me you can do nothing right here's a man's man but he did not mind holding on to Jesus Jesus gets him back in the boat and he's ready to deal with a storm and Peter won't let him go just hold me that's where we are we need to hold him while he's holding us it's important that it works both ways if you hold on to him you can know that he's holding on to you abiding if you abide in me and my words abide in you let's stand it's relationship but it's also Fellowship you can't be intimate with a page but you can draw strength from the presence of a person Jesus Christ he's more than the written record of who he is it's not just the written word it's not just the printed word it's not just the recorded word that this bride has to hold to in this hour it's the Living Word it's the one who lives in us it's the one who has skin when he needs to have skin but he's the one abide in in a so present everpresent help in the time of need if you turn loose of him remember you're going to eventually get the disconnected feeling doesn't mean he's let you go it means he's trying to make you aware of where you are all you have to do is call him don't let me go Jesus don't let me go Jesus don't let me go we're here Lord and we are coming to the closing hour hours of time we have seen the birth pains have now progressed and we're seeing more it
