hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] let's sing it again this morning i feel the glory [Music] [Music] as it blows [Music] from heavenly and my soul cries [Music] flow [Music] just play that a moment i remember the hotel room where my wife and i then you nearly took my microphone off my head but it was a good hug my wife and i were gathered in a hotel room in virginia and the glory of the lord the presence of the lord had been coming that morning over she and i in waves just coming it came before we prayed it came before we started even thinking on the lord and the things of the lord it just came and it came in waves and it was appearing physically we could see it manifesting physically in the room like drops of oil falling and we thought well i thought my eyes are doing this and my wife was in the other room and she was thinking my eyes are doing this we met in the middle and said did you see that and she said yeah did you see that and we realized that god was really manifesting himself in a glory way and i wrote this song that you're singing right now under that inspiration as the anointing of the lord was falling i love when he comes when we ask him when we invite him i love that but i love when he just comes because he wants to be with us he just wants to be where you are there's nothing like that would you sing it with me one more time i feel the [Music] as it flows [Music] from the heavenlies and in [Music] let your anointing yes flow through me bring the music down just a tad i want to hear the saints sing that of your presence as it come on from the heavenly [Music] and then my soul cries [Music] my papa my papa let your anointing flow through me if you're grateful for his presence his anointing in your life would you give him a hand clap of praise with me today worthy is our god [Applause] [Music] worthy is our lamb hallelujah [Applause] he is worthy he is worthy you may be seated this morning ben we're working you hard would you come and take this might just a minute i just don't think it would be right not to acknowledge the miracle in the room you know i think we ought to acknowledge that don't you i don't know if brother steve feels like saying anything or not but sister anita will i know for sure help us but if brother steve does he certainly can we'd love to hear his voice [Laughter] that's it [Laughter] he said i'll let it's on he said i'll let her go first that way we'll know how much time we have left [Laughter] well i just i just thank the lord for being here he's one to come for several weeks um he's hoping he can get back in his pulpit next week if at all possible wow um but you know we've had um today is two months two months that he was put in hospice care and we had we've had a battle since the lord has touched him um kind of like it's made me think about this morning about lazarus i'm sure after he came out of that tomb there are many trying to take him take him down because they didn't want to acknowledge the miracle no but when we went back to the hospital and there was a lot of circumstances and fights to even get back to cancer treatment center um stephen on the way said i want i want to call brother shelly and so we called brother shelly and i i was not at peace because i didn't know if they'd even take us back but uh one of the things that we prayed was that dr pannell the one who actually prayed over him many times and anointed him with oil would be the one that was on call that day which is very you know it's a touch and go situation you don't know but he was hallelujah and so when we walked in and i saw him walking down the hallway i started grinning because i knew he was going to be as shocked as a lot of them were but when he walked into the room after the scan he told stephen he said you are a miracle and god healed a perforated bowel and if any i know brother zach's gone through that as well but when your bowels have filled up your stomach cavity there is no option but surgery or death no other option but god performed the surgery on stephen hallelujah he did it he did it praise god he did hallelujah [Applause] so whenever dr pennell told us the news he was so excited because he's the one who was with tears just in his eyes he said this is the part of my job i hate because there's nothing we can do for him but send him home and making comforter comfortable and put him in hospice and i was like are you saying what i think you're saying he said yes he's at the end of his days and so i want anybody that doesn't believe god does miracles you're looking at one right here you're looking one right here and i don't understand [Music] praise the lord [Applause] i don't understand and i've wondered about this for the past couple weeks with brother zachary why that happens to be the part of the body that's being targeted right now but you know what i remember a sister tell me a long time ago that the colon represents not being able to let things go you know and i think that has maybe has a lot to do with it a lot of people get sick because they can't let things that's the truth and so if you're holding on to anything that would cause sickness in your physical spiritual yeah or any uh come on especially the physical and spiritual body let it go yes you know there are people and i really wouldn't say this any other time but i've seen god do so much there is nothing there is no person there's no circumstances that is worth you losing out in this last day nothing nothing and if you if you have a song or if you if you're sitting down on stuff because you have a grudge you better let go of it right now it is not worth it but i'm going to let my husband go on but i just want y'all to continue to pray because we're shocked because for some reason we have an appointment on january the 7th with oncologists and we don't know what that's about so i'm praying that they're going to start digging into what god's doing amen amen praise the lord well there were so many things that had taken place even in our hospitalization that uh you know the nurses acknowledged god yes the doctors acknowledged the lord her father began to acknowledge god and what god was doing he said surely god has done this and he's never been one to give god the glory for anything he's been uh you know away from god and all this but uh and we're just seeing so many miracles and no matter what you're going through god has a purpose yes he does you go through it might be your pain it might be your sorrow it might be something that god is going to use yes to to win somebody over to give somebody the faith that they need so uh just keep encouraging yourself have faith and david encouraged himself in the lord even when he was going through troubles and trials and things he encouraged himself in the lord yes and and as he and did that it inspired his men it inspired those around him to to pick up their swords to fight to move on uh this mountain is ours hallelujah this battle is ours brother i'm gonna tell you what the battle is yours you've got to inspire you got to encourage yourself in the lord yes and let god do some wonderful things that he's wanting to do yes god bless this church and i felt the prayers i know this church has prayed for us we have uh been listening in and we just know that god has really uplifted us and and encouraged us through the prayers of this sanctuary and i bless brother shelly god bless you and uh he is such an inspiration to us and i pray god continue to use him in a mighty way thank you sir amen amen lord we're so grateful we're so thankful for what you're doing [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah oh the lord is good we were there that day that he was dismissed from the hospital and uh he was certainly weak maybe a few days a week or something like that was what they thought he could survive so the thought comes to your mind oh will he make it will he be in another service with us will i be able to see him come rolling or walking through that door and you know what today two months later god did exactly that i could couldn't my eyes you know you want to rub your eyes even though you know god is good wonderful jesus [Applause] zach has a birthday and he's going to live to see it on thursday of this week he has a birthday [Applause] we're going to give you a few more days off on the drums and then you're up so get back to your uh post of duty here after a few more days and how how how many birthdays will this be zach 27. god bless you happy birthday we're glad for what the lord has done zion is not here with us this morning but she has a birthday can't forget her birthday it's on the 31st and is she turning 18 or 19. 19 turning 19. so we pray for her while she's away and then the next day saturday january the 1st is sister wegner's birthday they're streaming this service this morning in edmonton alberta canada that is sister uh judith sometimes i forget to say judith and say juju because that's that's her family name for with us but her mom is having a birthday god has been good to that family we've been praying for sister alfreda's oldest brother art and god has been sustaining him and helping him how old did he just didn't he just have a birthday just turn 90 and god is good he is helping him so we're thankful for the good report i don't know brother is it all right if i call your name out loud brother gabriel son we're glad to have you i probably didn't say it just right but we're very glad to have you from florida god bless you he's driven all the way from florida to be with us i don't know this brother we we've never met is that right i can't hear him yes we've never met we've only had just a little bit of correspondence the reason i'm asking that is i don't i don't know too much about our brother we're very glad that he is here but when i woke up this morning the lord spoke to my heart and uh very directly and and asked me he didn't tell me it was a little bit strange the language that came to me but he asked me to sing this brother a song so i'm going to sing him a song i don't know if it'll be something that he likes i don't know what his style would be but it's the words and the lord wanted him to hear this song this morning he may have already heard it on the stream but this is for him [Music] i was standing on a mountain i was looking towards the sky when i saw a storm approaching and i feared that i would die saw god's creatures [Music] run and seek a better place to hide i heard the thunder roll down in my soul then i bowed my head and cried [Music] now the clouds were moving faster and the lightning was flashing bright and the clouds so dark they hid the light of the sun and it seemed that it was night when all it wants there was a feeling [Music] like i've never had before up above the storm you should have heard me sing god had given me [Music] it with me this morning so spread your [Music] wings little eggo and [Music] you weren't born to live down in the valley no you were born to soar through the sky don't let your trials bring you down or drive your spirit low [Music] and fly now all at once his spirit [Music] lifted me till i was high above it all [Music] you know i never even had to move my wings the holy spirit he had took control i was soaring high above my circumstances my confusion and all my pain [Applause] and though i had spent many years in that old barnyard i was always an eagle by his name so spread your wings little and fly [Music] listen you were not born to peck around in this old dark valley oh you were elected to soar through the sky don't let your trials bring you down or drive your spirit low to the ground mount up with wings little ears here's the key keep your eyes upon god's son the battle it's nearly one up where the wings little eggs [Music] by your grace by your grace lord hallelujah how many eagles are here this morning do you know who you are let's stand together i don't know why that was just a strange thing to wake up to this morning but the lord is good and he knows all things thank you mary beth i appreciate that so much would you give thanks to god for the musicians and their labor among us this morning thank you so much thank you for being here we have so many out the texts were beginning to come in of those who were unwell and unable to be here this morning and i'm just thinking lord i wonder who will be here and you look you showed up and there's some of you i never have a doubt about i know you're going to be here come hell high water is that ugly did i just say something ugly if i did i didn't mean to yes ma'am all right [Music] and i'm telling you don't come back from that and i'm telling you what god can do he gave them no hope i was branded i was everything but god god and i'm telling you yes come on yes yes amen [Music] hallelujah that's perfectly in order amen turn to isaiah chapter 40. i want to give you a little of what the lord has given me for this morning we had the privilege on friday of addressing the virtual convention uh out of pastor tay's church in tema ghana west africa where we have been nearly a dozen times now and god has blessed that group and you've met pastor tay and you've met his son jesse and you've seen the pictures of how they grew from a small place to what god has given them today and it just keeps expanding every time we we get pictures we're getting updates and god's just adding numbers to the church and and increasing their facility and but there are still some coveted restrictions in place and so there has to be social distancing in the sanctuary which requires a chair and then about six feet and a chair and about six feet and so uh a building that's usually can can be easily filled a couple thousand people that greatly reduces the number of folks that were able to be in the building so uh we couldn't travel to ghana this year as we have many christmas uh holidays and so we were able to address the body and open the conference for them on friday and the theme of the meetings were spiritual astronauts that's a pretty good theme isn't it and so the lord moved and we're getting some reports already of how god moved and i was able to catch a little of the service yesterday from pastor imprium who pastors up in obwasi ghana which is up in the gold coast and we were there with him the last time we were there and and uh god really used our brother i tell you i was greatly blessed so i was thinking about spiritual astronauts and living in the heights and these things were in my mind but i had no intention of bringing any of that today when i when i heard the lord dealing with my heart this morning when i woke up he was taking me in another direction for this service and so we will just go with god isn't that a good idea you think that's a good plan verse 28 of isaiah 40 hast thou not known hast thou not heard that the everlasting god the lord the creator of the ends of the earth fainteth not neither is weary how many of you have heard this about our god he does not faint he never grows weary he never slumbers he never sleeps there is no searching of his understanding you could never reach the end of all god knows hallelujah the next verse he giveth power to the faint didn't you just hear sister beth living testimony he gives power to the faint didn't you just hear sister anita and brother steve he gives power to the faint and to them that have no might no personal strength or power he increaseth strength does this sound like our god today hallelujah amen it does even the youths shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall has there ever been an hour where we hear even our children being exhausted stressed out worn out you asked some of these children what's wrong with you two three years old i'm exhausted you wonder where they get such a big word i'm worn out well i don't know if i always believe that but here the bible said so even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait hallelujah they that wade upon the lord shall renew their strength i'm reading it like that because i want to emphasize it in your heart i want it to go beyond your ears and into your spirit today and i want you to know if we can wade upon the lord and that doesn't mean sit around and do nothing we can serve him the word wade in hebrew means to to serve it means not to abandon your responsibility they that wade upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mound up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint now let's look at verse 31 in the amplified before we move on but those who wait for the lord who expect who look for and hope in him shall change and renew their strength and power they shall lift their wings and mount up close to god as eagles mount up to the sun they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint or become tired how many of you want to claim that kind of a promise this morning it's yours let's pray heavenly father we thank you lord that in a busy time holiday time like what the world is going through right now and many taking advantage of these days to visit with friends enjoying time off work and being able to be reunited with family in various places we bless that and we thank you for giving the opportunity for such fellowship but lord we are here today gathered in your name believing that you have an appointment with us and that there is a purpose and a reason for us being here today and lord we have come to hear from you we're not here to hear from flesh alone but we're here to hear what you would have to say to us for no one knows us like you do papa you know us like no other and today we ask that you would give us the grace to be untethered to no longer be earth bound as it has been spoken already today that we be able to let go and let god have his wonderful way may we not carry any dead weight around our shoulders but may we soar into the highest heights of what you have for us in this hour and i claim and pray like now for sister tebow who has reached out for prayer over the course of the last few days you are her healer you are her strength you have sent your word to heal her and lord we stand with her right now believing that you will renew her body that you will curse the root of the disease that desires to take her from our midst we ask oh god that you renew her youth and her strength her faith be anointed in such an hour as this we claim this promise in the name of the lord jesus christ amen and the saint said you may be seated this morning we need to move along maybe you as a believer of an end-time message maybe you are weary of the analogy of the eagle maybe you have heard it so many times and thought about it so many times until it almost seems impersonal and you don't really feel your identification with an eagle i agree that we can ponder something for so long and it becomes common to us and we miss but i can't forget the time many years ago now in the late 80s that the voice of the lord spoke clearly to my heart i didn't understand what he meant i didn't know what he was talking about but he just spoke very clearly and nearly audibly into my inner being and he said surround yourself with eagles well it sounded nice i knew his voice i had no doubt that it was the spirit speaking to my life but neither did i have any idea how to practically walk it out how does one surround themselves with eagles i didn't know how i didn't think that i could go to some birds of prey center and become involved in the work that they do in saving the eagle i just only thought came to my mind i know exactly where i was in north carolina when he spoke that to me and in that little mountain town there were all kinds of shops and one day uh just before i was going to meet someone for lunch i stopped into a little christian bookstore surprise to find one uh in this little town boone north carolina is where i was meeting someone for lunch and it seemed like they had a whole section of eagles this was in the 80s whole section of eagles beautiful eagle painting and and and all kinds of little statues and statuettes and plaques and little things and i thought my these are nice things uh the lord spoke to me to surround myself with eagles so i i might just take a few of these little things home with me and hang them in my office and physically surround myself with the beauty of the eagle i'd always been fascinated by an eagle now i'd always told everybody it was my favorite bird but i still didn't know the significance of surrounding myself with eagles so i was just looking for a way that it might i might could take some kind of physical action little did i know that god was speaking to me about overcomers he was talking to me about a people who had been given a certain diet and that diet was strengthening them to rise above to get up higher than all the stuff that was going on in their lives i didn't know that god was talking to me about a message that would be eagle food it would become foolishness to many but to those who have been touched and called and elected for such a purpose it would become the reason that we live and i can say today that that truth has become the reason that i exist today because i see a little bride being built all around the world i know they are spiritual astronauts i know they are called to be eagles i know that there are many characteristics in the natural eagle that also apply to the believer in the spiritual and i don't want to lose sight of that because i like you can get bogged down in what's going on in my life and i can get weary and i can grieve how many of you know you don't just have to have a death in your family to grieve we grieve over anything that's taken from us or that we lose and i like you can get bogged down in the darkness of the moment in the heaviness of the moment and momentarily forget who i am but i want you to know the spirit of god in such an hour as we are leaving 2021 and moving into 2022 we are leaving something behind and we are stretching forward to grab a hold of something in this coming year not because the calendar has changed but because we know we are getting closer and closer and closer to the culmination of everything that god has promised that he wanted to do for his bride and then through his bride and then she'll take that ultimate flight rapture grace how many of you are looking for that we're looking for that that is our ultimate way out you know the the denominational christians make fun of us sometime because we still believe in a rapture and they like to believe that they're they're going to have to press through great tribulation i have no problem with that teaching because i think for the majority of folks it's nothing but their truth but i want you to know there are people in the earth that are not appointed to wrath i want to remind you that there are those that god saw from before the foundation of the world that would not be lost in satan's eden nor would they be confused under those blasphemous names but they would recognize who they are and they would overcome all things i want to say it again all things i want you to help me a little bit this morning because i see the need just like you do for every one of us in this hour to get up above i've been watching you press don't get weary now don't be weary in well-doing for you will reap in due season if you faint not you keep pressing into praise you kept pushing in to worship him if you feel dry as a bone praise him anyway if you feel lonesome and detached from god you just draw up and praise him anyway refuse to be discouraged and pushed out run right back in take a hold of your promise and praise god until the reality of that promise is made known you believe it works i'm going to have to pull a minute you believe that works in the message putting on the whole armor of god nothing could be more important in this hour than making sure you are putting on the whole armor of god if you've done it today you'll need to do it again tomorrow it's something that we have a tendency to lay down in the midst of the battle in paragraph 82 brother branham said the chief this was the first one thank you the chief is leading leading us home amen come on home in my father's house are many mansions if it wasn't so i'd have told you i'll not leave you comfortless i'll come again and be with you even in you to the end of the world that's a couple of scriptures combined but it's our good news today isn't it the works that i do shall you do also a little while in the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world chief leading on amen now my lord knows the way through the wilderness do you believe that all i have to do is he knows the way somebody said i can't see the future i can't see five minutes ahead of where i'm living right now i know that and i understand that but i need to remind you that your chief has already gone before you he already knows the way here we are living underneath the restriction and boundary of time but where he lives where he sees from how he ministers in that realm there is no limitation of time it's all eternity he sees the end from the beginning and the beginning from the end he knows the way through the wilderness my lord knows the way through the wilderness that you're walking through right now all you have to do is follow amen he said here the trump trump tramping of the army marching on to victory not paying any attention to all this unbelief and all crows and buzzards hollering around here how about reading that for me we're eagles we're eagles can help what the sparrows are doing we're eagles can't be distracted by what the crows are doing we're eagles let's soar out of you're you're talking like i can just do it at will i can just get above it you're understanding me you're not misunderstanding me you are understanding me because we know that our atmosphere is controlled by our mindset if you've got a mindset for the valley the valley is where you're going to peck around if you've got a mindset just to get above the heads of somebody else that's about how high you'll fly you'll look around and say well at least i'm better off than he is you know that's not your goal just to get up a little above somebody in your family or somebody in your church you've got something more of pulling on you than to just get up above a little circumstance you've got a whole heaven out there that's calling you to higher heights to new dimensions to new realms of the spirit that you and i have only pecked into tapped into and we're called to be are you with me we're called to be immersed in those things not just taste them like appetizers in a meal but we are to feast on the hope and the promise that god has given us i've got some things for you that you've never walked in and you've never known and you've never understood so many around this message put everything in the past but i noticed the prophet never put anything in the past he had a tendency to call even the future into the present he'd look out there and see what god was going to do and then he'd say he's doing it where is somebody going to take that kind of an example today and look out there at what god is going to do and what he's promised to do and raise up and say he's doing it somebody said well i'm not experiencing that just because you and i are not experiencing that doesn't mean that it's not true doesn't mean that god's not doing it somewhere for those who believe so i encourage you dare to believe to take god at his word you know uh well let's go on we're eagles let's soar out of everything amen our theme for camp meeting messages where how to overcome anything and that's how we get above it how do you overcome anything you get above it how do you get above it you change your atmosphere by changing your mindset how do you change your mindset by changing your thoughts oh hallelujah i could go to bed depressed and discouraged and wake up and something has happened because he keeps trying to pull me up into something more than what i'm willing to pull myself up into sometime hallelujah i have hope i want you to know hope's a powerful force it takes more than hope to get the job done but hope will keep you pointed in the right direction until your faith can be anointed the enemy wants you hopeless the enemy wants you to feel bankrupt and helpless and that there's no way out of the situation that you're in right now but i want you to know there is and even greater some of you that are believing god for great promises in your life i want to tell you this morning under the inspiration of the holy spirit that you're not even really believing for the fullness of what he has because he hasn't even let you know the whole what we're operating on now is just what he lets us get a hold of a glimpse here and there but the half has never yet been told of what god desires to do in you and through you a harvest will follow a quick short work and then a rapture hallelujah then you can ask one another how do i look leave in this world eagles are high flyers i want to know if there are any high flyers in here well i'm not flying too high this morning you don't have to tell me that i can look at you [Music] but we are we are somebody said well i just feel like i can't hardly get my head above water been there done that you know when i try to preach positive sometimes some folks don't want me to because you're not feeling very positive but i want you to know if somebody don't pull on you every now and again you never will feel any different than you feel right now if somebody doesn't somehow bring a little bit of that in to your perspective let you see a little bit that god i tell you in his name god has not forgotten you he knows exactly where you are what you're going through how you feel what you thought what you're thinking right now he sees it and he's still calling you like an eagle that's soar out of everything eagles are high flyers oh we are better suited in the heights you get us down here among the things of this world and we get awkward and we trip over one another we don't know how to greet one another sometime isn't that a shame we don't know how to act around one another we clam up sometime we act like a bunch of misfits a bunch of screws nuts and bolts and did i make did that sound bad i was trying to get a hold of something the prophet said about it's all right to be a nut i'm so glad he said that brother david man i'm so glad he gave you and i'm permission to be nuts he said it's all right to be a nut as long as you're threaded to the right bolds that bolt is jesus christ as long as you know who you're attached to doesn't matter how you feel sometime somebody go on the trip and come back we act like we've never seen them don't even know who they are we feel so awkward they act like they've never been to church we have to get around each other and learn you know why you know why we get so awkward some time of the enemy is in that and he inspires that and he breathes on that but you know why we get like that sometimes because we are not made for this old world we were made for a higher plane we were built i want you to know we are specially built for the heights we don't function the same in the low land that we function when we get up above the snake line hallelujah so what do we do we say come lord and take me right where i belong we got to hurry did you know the eagle he likes to fly at about ten thousand feet the average jets flying about 30 to 35 000 feet and an eagle likes to go a third of that and the eagles have been have been spotted going higher than that but they they like to fly at about 10 000 feet if they stayed that high you not never see them so i'm very thankful for those who come dipping down over the campground maribeth sometimes thinks of me and she sends me pictures of eagles that she's seen here on the campground r.j last sunday sent me pictures of an eagle that was flying over the campground and he last sunday morning and he captured it close enough that you could see no doubt about it when you get that white head when you can see that white head you know what you've got somebody said you don't still get excited about an eagle flying over this in fact i got so thrilled about it in my spirit last sunday that when i pulled up on the campground one day for work and there was a bunch of crows sitting out there in the art i said why you god bless brother vermillion he's gone to heaven i can talk about the crows he used to call me and leave me a message every time i preached on crows and he'd say brother shelly you're mighty hard on crows he was an eccentric fellow but a precious brother he'd say your mighty heart on crows don't you know there has to be crows don't you know god created him and i said to him one time yes brother i love what crow whatever crow's function whatever their function is in the great circle of life i'm thankful for the crows i know god made them i know god couldn't make every every bird an eagle but he didn't call me to hang around with crows he called me to be where an eagle is he built me to be so when i pulled on the campground there was a whole flock of crows out there and i just said open my door and i said get out of here you don't discourage me i i know somewhere up there i may not see him but there's an eagle flying over this place you're not going to move in here on us you know how that crow behaves brother adam talked about the hypocrite nature of a crow and he mixes his diet all the time but not an eagle you know where i'm going so we read that that an eagle can soar uh he likes to fly at about ten thousand feet and he can maintain short bursts of fifteen thousand feet no other bird can soar so high you put another bird of sparrow or some other bird like that that high and he explodes he'll fall to the ground he was not created or designed for that kind of high flying their large wingspan and that that varies but but but can average it about seven feet i want you to know six to seven feet that's a that's a man's height so you lay down on the ground and that eagle can spread his wings that far and sometimes a little more than that so he doesn't have to do a lot of moving to them wings to get a long way in a hurry because that wing span allows him to glide and use very little energy to go where he's going did you know that uh that an eagle can soar for hours without ever flapping his wings at all he just sets his wings and the updrafts of the wind just catch underneath those specially built wings five primary feathers on each wingtip of an eagle and they are able by by an unusual joint in the wing they are able to circulate those five primary feather tips on the on the end or tips of their wings they are able to circulate that and it creates an updraft underneath their body and that's how an eagle draws his little ones up under him in a storm they are able to circulate like that creating a centrifugal force that if that little eagle gets too far away mama or daddy knows exactly what to do to pull that eagle didn't god say i bear you i took you out of that land of bondage and brought you over here to the promise with eagle's wings he knows how to pull us up under the great wings of that great jehovah eagle our papa who's watching over us built for that reason because god the designer knew that once those little eagles get to eaglets get to flying on their own they think they don't need mom and daddy anymore and they get a little little adventurous in the storm so god created a way for the parents to tend their little ones just suck them right back up under their chest and protect them from harm brother we have been given what we need to get right up under his everlasting wings and find our rest he draws us and if you want god to draw you here's the key if if we will the bible tells us if we draw nigh to him am i there if we draw nigh to him he will draw nigh unto us that's a promise that he has made in a message god's only provided place of worship paragraph 196 i hope you'll stay with me because i'm getting somewhere after a while paragraph 196 he said that's the same thing in the church they're trying to mix the denomination with the word to try to make the word say what the denomination says oh i hear that sometime i hear people saying to me that well that i know what it said but that's not what it meant well we've got a lot of divine interpreters of the word don't we i know what i read but it don't really mean that listen folks that's one way to get yourself in trouble this is a denominational spirit that gets on us sometime and they'll say well i think it's says that but it doesn't really mean that you know you mentioned something about uh the way that a woman should dress or do her hair or a man or something you mention these practical things and they say that that's not the church's place to talk about those things and i don't think that's what it really means and so forth but i want you to know the nature of that eagle it's not always trying to mix the word with some denominational creed or idea there's something a little bit more pure about the way that eagle operates he said they're trying to mix the denomination with the word try to make the word say what the denomination says and when you do that you have to spray them and baby them he's talking about hotbed plants and so forth those who are not high those who are hybrid instead of the original he said when you have do that you have to spray them and baby them and give them gold stars to come to sunday school i like it that brother brandon picked up on that pack of pews the church is still today i see it sometime in the news they they're going to give you a 50 i better not tell this some of you some of you will run to church over there and see if you can get you one they will say if you pack out three pews you're going to be uh registered to win a 52-inch flat screen television that's so much of the world isn't it that's like telling people if you come over here and help me build my church i'll help you get to hell by filling your life full of all the stuff you don't need to fill your life with anyway can anybody say man something is wrong with that picture we don't have time to mix the word with denominational ideas and give people little gold stars for coming to sunday school somebody said i just don't like it in church how people who don't do right get all the attention and we who do right all the time we don't ever get noticed they don't know whether we're here or there you know what that sounds like that sounds like a little preschooler waiting on their gold star come on you know that don't sound like a grown-up child of god give them ghost stars to come to sunday school and everything else he said that's right then he goes on is there more when a genuine born-again christian born with the word of god he's rugged he said he's rugged that's you did you know the prophet is calling the spiritual eagle rugged he's saying we don't get moved by things that move other birds we don't get blown away and troubled by things that others get troubled and blown away by he said that's you the lies and things of this world don't bother him he's an eagle [Music] he does what he flies oh i'm glad mostly southerners here you can understand this he flies plumb past it how many of you know he's not talking about fruit he's talking about getting up past all the little bothers all the little harassments of the enemy he soars into the heavenly see it's true it's true if you believe it's true say amen in the message it is the rising of the sun i have to get these out i'm under instructions this morning paragraph 263 he said we're tired of such stuff as that get back [Applause] your eagles back to the word of god he called us rugged while ago now he calls us burly i hope you sisters don't mind being called burly he's talking about being spiritually rugged he's talking about being spiritually burly be burly nothing oh hallelujah he's talking about being tough and strong and making up your mind that nothing is going to hurt you hinder you now you're just going to keep going he said nothing can hurt your feelings be burly we're not quite there this would be a good place to have some water let me see if i can get the hose here be burly we're not quite in that place where nothing can hurt our feelings but we're working on that and you know the way we work on that the most is to recognize that it's not what somebody says or thinks or does about us or toward us it's what he knows about us and if you want to hear what he knows about us here it is be burly nothing can hurt your feelings therefore you're free from all the scandal of man whatever anybody says against you that just brings oh it's a good place to skip that just brings more love when we could be those who wallow in our feelings he says use this as an opportunity to bring more love god let it be so in my life it's just quite honestly not often the case i want it to be the case i want it to be the norm when i feel a little bit hurt or put out i want god to help me come quickly back to more love realizing that if i make that kind of a stand nothing is going to be able to slow me down nothing is going to be able to tether me to this old world you're going to you're not going to get the the punchline if you don't help get there come on help me get there in the message countdown shreveport i know it's a lot of quoting i got some more too so i won't apologize the countdown shreveport 62 i use this for the saints in ghana the spiritual astronaut is eagles he goes beyond all denominational creeds all denominational barriers all denominational thinkings all their cloudy thoughts he's above every cloud everything there is to look at he's up around the stars the astronaut and the astronaut believer is also up in the heavenlies can we catch the second part of that there i wanna i wanna there's one phrase i want them to see yes and the astronaut believer is also up in the heavenlies he's far beyond read this for me would you these every spirit in hell would like to tether you to this earth he would like to emphasize your sorrow he would like to emphasize your circumstance he would like to emphasize your hope deferred and how long you've been waiting on god to keep his promise in your life he would like to cause you to question everything that god has spoken to you through others and everything that god has spoken to you personally if he can keep you in the land of wondering if he can keep you in the position of wandering then he can keep you in a place of wandering because the more we wonder the more we wander and we often just wander around in circles killing time hoping for something better the something better you're looking for is above your head to access it we must remember who we are we must remember that it's not more flapping that's going to get us higher it's more trusting hello the eagle doesn't flap himself to higher places often he doesn't have to he can but often he just feels the wind sets his wings and allows the wind to carry him to a higher place where he can look and i'll tell you the higher you get the farther you can see huh the higher you get the farther you can see he's up high this astronaut believer he's in the outer space see the earthly man doesn't know very much about outer space but if the astronaut's in the outer space he's there with it so brother branham is typing the eagle and the astronaut the spiritual astronaut together and reminding us that whatever we wanted to use whatever analogy we can relate to the best we need to understand that the key is to get up above it and you've got a way there you don't have to work yourself there you've got to rest yourself there you've got to trust yourself there you've got to praise yourself there is anybody with me good good i'm so glad i'm glad you are because i want to move on we find out that that eagle builds his nest when it comes time to build his nest he's a great great defender he has equipment to defend himself he has very few enemies there are very few things the eagle's concerned about you've heard many times one of them is the snake so when he builds his nest he builds his nest high enough that he feels like he's above where the snakes are he gets up above the snake line and he laces that she excuse me lays her eggs there because she knows that they're safer there than anywhere else if you've got a nest to build i suggest you do the same if you've got a place to dwell or or you're looking for a refuge somewhere in the spirit i trust that you won't let it be on this earth or the plane of this life i pray you'll pick you out of place up above in the promises of god in those high places that we've been called to sit together in in christ jesus i pray that's where you'll make your your your nest your place to rest in the message as the eagle stirth up her nest brother branham says in paragraph 21 another thing about an eagle an eagle's a special bird because he will never build his nest on the ground he builds his nest way up high he likens that to his church you are a city that is set on a hill not in a valley can you say amen you're a city that's set on a hill that can be seen afar off a lighted candle it can be seen afar off the church setting up high with high expectations and high ambitions that what we have seen up until now is only a foretaste just a glimpse of what god has for those who dare to believe now an eagle is a fearless hunter did you know that the talons or claws on an eagle's toes are curved and razor sharp for catching and holding their prey the rough bumps on the eagles toes help them hold slippery wiggling prey like fish the long talons can inflict serious wounds to intruders i don't know if you've ever seen anything that's been pulled apart freshly by an eagle but it looks like it's been sliced up and that eagle does that with those sharp talons the diet consists mainly of fish but also waterfowl and small animals i know in the modern church there's some controversy about this uh scripture i want you to put up matthew 24 28 because it happens to be a word in in greek that can be used for either an eagle a majestic bird or a buzzard a very low bird somebody said i don't think that's the right theme that we should use around the message since they they say that that greek word can also be used for a buzzard and i just tell them i don't have any problem i know exactly what this scripture means it's a spiritual word it's a prophetic word it's being fulfilled in our day it was fulfilled a generation ago it's being fulfilled in our day and i don't care if that same word has sometimes been used in context as a buzzard i don't think there's a more appropriate word than the translators chose here than eagle for wheresoever the carcass is there will be eagles be gathered together we're not talking about the rabbit we're not talking about the fish we're not talking about the dead possum we're talking about the body word of the lord jesus christ the bleeding word and where the bleeding word is there will the eagles be gathered together that word gathered the eagles a generation ago and that word is gathering eagles around the world in the hour that we live because they're finicky about what they eat the eagle is finicky now you'll often see pictures they like to show i don't know why they like to bring the eagle down so but you'll sometimes see the eagle sitting on a on a a prey it looks like it's been laying there for a long time and you do a little research on that and you'll find out that the eagle like any other animal like any other bird when it gets hungry enough it'll eat food whether it killed the food or not i'm so glad it doesn't have to be that way in this hour i'm glad i don't have to go into the denominational church to get a meal the brandon said if you did he said if you can't get a loaf you get a slice you know the difference i'm glad i'm not in a position that i have to go over there and spit seed i'm glad that i don't have to go into that system and look for bones all the time i'm glad that god has given me a place where i can hear his word and i don't have to worry about the mixture of this denominational system amen i'm glad that jesus that great slain carcass the body word of god is available to us we don't have to come into the four walls to get it do we it's available it's there in this message returning jubilee my gotta hurry when i put this together it just seemed like it'd just be so so so small to get it all but now i realize i'm not halfway done i may just skip here in a minute because i want to get to something that i believe is today you've heard it already but it's today it's today it's for today paragraph 63 of return in jubilee he said an eagle can go where no other bird can think of going if he'd try to follow him he'd disintegrate he's a special built bird yes indeed i will tell you a man that's born of the spirit of god is a special built man or woman hallelujah they're born with a spirit in them and knows how to act and to do and to be a son of god amen it's true you know that's the truth he said yes sir we don't have to have our women it used to be a shame for our women to cut their hair now if you're streaming this service don't get all bent out of shape like sister best said she used to do but i noticed her hair was looking lovely around her shoulders today don't get bent out of shape the word is the word is the word we're not here to condemn anybody if a woman wants to do her hair like a man look like a man confuse the genders that's on her we don't condemn her we don't question people when they come to worship with us we get asked all the time there was a woman here just a few weeks ago in a pair of slacks she stopped at the sound booth on her way in she said is it all right for me to come in here and worship like this you know what the young man told her of course it is you are more than welcome we have no condem this is how we worship our god this is what he's called us to do we're not here to condemn anybody else but i love what brother branham is saying here he's reminding them that this was at one time the standard of all the pentecostal churches and the baptist and the methodist he said you know the truth yes sir we our women it used to be a shame for our women to cut their hair he said they're doing it hello don't you get quiet they're doing it it used to be wrong for women to wear makeup they do it i'm not going to stay here i'm gonna move quickly past this but to me there's nothing worse than a former pentecostal because they don't even know how to put that stuff on somebody needs to tell them there's got to be a better way of applying it you notice they go from none to tammy there needs to be some help for them if they that's the way they're going to do it it's quiet in here i'm i'm at peace pentecostal he said i want went here not long ago to one of our famous pentecostal churches they knowed what was coming so i just go to preach the word and i've been preaching it every one of them got it went out almost that would be okay if i was somewhere preaching in a pentecostal church but i'm not i'm over here preaching to people who say they have the truth so you shouldn't be offended at a casual reminder that we're called to be different than this world around us oh yes they know that was coming all right they didn't have hardly enough to have a sunday school you get he just kind of cleaned it out for him they went bob there went bob-haired women and ricky's and elvises that's men by the way with bangs in their faces and beat neck clothes and and all of them taking off one way and this way and that way and with sonny's good i said that bunch of chickens oh it's quiet that bunch of chickens they can't stand good fresh meat that's right it's nothing but the truth the church would be running over here today if you look like the rest of the church world if we could accept what they have accepted then we would be more appealing to them but folks we understood a long time ago we're not building an organization we're not building a well-oiled business here we're building up believers reminding them that we are called to live above the ordinary [Applause] to give god all that he ask hallelujah without any bitterness in our hearts we need a holy ghost eagles eat they eat eagle food eagles don't live off creeds they live off the holy ghost they live off of christ god's real eagles there had to be there there had to be born special they weren't even created like like others around them now i want you to know that eagles eat eagle food but eagles don't eat other eagles this is where we have to pray more and apply god's word more because we have a tendency to consume one another in our in in our squeamish uh skirmishes or whatever it is that we go through sometime in family or in church we have this tendency to look at one another as an enemy almost we want to gobble them up so that there's nothing left but i want you to know that you can't do that i can't do that and get off the ground it's eagle food that takes us to higher places not eating one another if you can say amen please do now i don't know where skip skip skip skip skip revelation 4 7. and the first beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third beast had a face as a man and the fourth beast you read that for me it was like a flying eagle you find it a little bit out of the ordinary that john didn't say the first beast was like a roaring lion the second beast was like a moon cow the third beast was like a handsome man or a man doing manly things he didn't say anything about the lion the calf and the beast the third beast of man you didn't say anything about what they were doing what kind of action but when he looked at that fourth living creature which is the one that releases the anointing for the hour we're living in hallelujah it wasn't a roaring lion or a calling ox he said the fourth beast was like a flying eagle why wasn't an eagle just standing there what was it that caused john to look at that fourth living creature and say flying eagle i don't know exactly how john saw him all i know is my experience and in my experience everywhere he went his wings were stretched out even when he was walking on the earth even when he was not soaring i don't mean to get so spiritual that we lose some folks but i was standing here one time some years ago and god allowed a vision to open up of those four living creatures and i saw them walking and moving around in the spirit realm but it was as though it was right here on the platform i've had a couple more experiences with those four living creatures through the years and every time i saw the flying eagle his wings were always stretched like this even when he appeared that he was walking on the earth his wings were always stretched like this when john saw him he said he appeared as a flying eagle it's a message it's a symbolism to us come on now we cannot forget how to fly we cannot forget how to get above it oh we cannot forget how to set our wings we've got to be ready at any moment to catch the blowings and the movings of the spirit of god are you awake a few weeks ago the spirit began to breathe a little fresh on our services in worship and after the preaching he began to blow a little fresh and i saw some eagles in here getting their wings out preparing to catch the updraft of the spirit we saw that moving among us it's not that it has withdrawn it's just a little bit different maybe now i'll tell you i wouldn't i wouldn't trade anything for what i felt this morning when we were worshiping the lord i i don't want you to think in any way i'm diminishing what i felt what i experienced the movings of god the absence flows i'm feeling something now the abs and flows of his spirit that move i want you to know too many message believers have become rigid [Music] they call themselves eagles but they walk around with their wings to their side not that flying eagle no no no when i observed him in the spirit he had his wings out no matter what was going on he kept his wings out hear what i'm saying because he didn't ever know at one moment the wind might blow the spirit might move the will of god oh yes we get our roots down deep all right but sometimes it's not on the rock it's this attitude i will not be moved but i want you to know god wants to be able to move you whoo but brother shelly i had moved in a long time it don't matter it doesn't matter how long it's been since you've allowed the spirit to move you he's still god you're still an eagle if you were ever a son of god you were always a son of god your fellowship might change with him but who you are in relationship can never change come on if you ever were a son you are a son if you ever were a part of the bride did you know i've had people say to me through the years that leave church they go out and they say that bride life is just too hard for me so what do you think you think you can just go back into the systems of this world and and live and be happy i remember a man standing on my not on my porch but looking up at me standing on the porch and he said i don't want this years ago i don't want you to think for one minute brother shelly that we intend to change our standard of living just because we feel our time here is over doesn't mean that we have any intention my daughters are going to look you see us you'll see us looking just like we have looked while we worshipped here you see my wife you'll notice that she looks just we don't want to change our standard we have no intention of going back into the world yes but you see them now you see them a few weeks after being out from under this kind of an influence and inspiration you sit them down a few weeks in a denominational church where there is no standard and the next thing you know they forget who they are somebody said well they must have never believed that they just did it because the church did so far i don't know what all the reasons are but i know whatever you do to honor god you'll be blessed for it somebody said i never did understand why that was the way we do that you may never understand it but if you honor god by honoring the standard that he has set over this house you'll be blessed because of that you never go wrong people never intend but you get out in a different atmosphere and you forget who you are you let your wings drop i'm preaching keep them up folks keep your wings up i'm not just talking about praise i mean keep them set i fee i feel i feel a little wild in a good way i feel like i can't get out what i feel even describe what i feel but every time i throw out my arms i feel a little something getting behind my back i know it's not about feeling don't ever think that it's about feeling because there will be a time when you don't feel anything and if you don't feel anything you'll think god doesn't love you brother branham said what does feelings have to do with it so don't you ever live by feeling but don't you ever deny it if you feel him and don't you ever be ashamed that you're sensitive enough blow us lord blow us lord hallelujah let your wind come underneath our wings and raise us up paragraph 186 you'll have to skip down to it zoe because i was going to start early and i'm not i'm going to reserve my time i got to close 186 but in the last message that went forth it's uh easter seal but in that last message that went forth this is the last paragraph that started at one there we started at 182 i'm going to 186. but in the last message thank you that went forth there come a flying eagle it's eagle time reveal time the word of god made manifest the word of god proved or children walk into this baptism of the holy spirit come in and believe it with all your heart god will feel you i notice the comments that some people make on social media those who feel that they have moved [Music] you know beyond the message when it's clear to see that they're operating in some form of hyper judaism some some form of of trying to please god by pleasing the law i want you to know we are called to remember sabbath we are called to remember the feast of the lord we are called to remember what god has told us i was watching a little episode yesterday of the chosen some of you have seen that i was real late getting on the board the train then i had to binge to get it are there things you don't agree with always but are there things that bless you how many of you have seen the episode of the pool of bethesda let me see your hand i'm going to tell you something let me ask again some of you looking look folks don't be so spiritual that you miss an opportunity to see something that might bless your blesser let's see there's another there's another episode i saw that i wanted to mention the pool of bethesda and there was one just a few before that i wanted to make sure my family saw it together but that episode on the pool of bethesda i'm telling you that was really something now i've done lost my train of thought and why i even mentioned it in the first place there was something that was said in that oh what were we talking about i don't hear ye yeah yeah thank you so much i don't want to miss that because i understand the pool i've lived for for some time back and forth in the land of the bible i understand that pool but i want you to know we need the holy ghost and if when we think about holy ghost you think about jumping around that's your problem that's not all the holy ghost comes to do to cause us to jump around so i read some comments where people make you know they say it seems like they're always trying to pull us into something uh pull us into a higher place and all i want to say is been there done that got the t-shirt and kept on moving i love the fact that god works in his own calendar and he moves in these things i love these things but i don't love the religious spirit that it produces in some folks i don't love that i know sister joyce posted something about about a quote from brother branham about how we need the we do don't you be discouraged by any naysayer we need that we need that children we need that not just talking in tongues and running the island jumping around but we need the holy ghost to give us strength and power to live the overcomers life you think i want to go back to arguing over trimming the corners of my beard that would be like me going back to the assemblies of god and arguing with them about how long is long and how short is short i'll tell you what short time time is short we don't have time for religious arguments we need the holy ghost oh children walk into this baptism of the holy spirit come in and believe it with all your heart god will fill you don't get out of sorts i'm just telling you the truth i'm just telling you the truth now we need that flying eagle and we need eagle vision but i don't have time to talk about that let's get that let's get that tuesday night but here is what i wanna i wanna talk about in closing [Music] psalms 103 and 5 turn there with me i moved on to page 9 of the notes and left a lot but i'll get back to that another time who satisfieth this is psalm 103 and 5 who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth god do this for sister tevo today and every senior in this church including myself who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is what renewed like the eagles in the amplified it says this who satisfies your mouth your necessity and desire at your personal age and situation with good so that your youth renewed is like the eagle's strong overcoming soaring how many of you want something to be renewed in you so that you are once again soaring now i know this there has been controversy through the years about the eagles moping and molting period some scientists and those who study the birds say that it just is simply not accurate i however believe that in many cases it is and it happens i'm not going to bore you with some of my research that i pulled up and found today and and pulled over here into my notes i mean i already had it stored and ready but i won't read at all but clark's commentary some of you know who that is he said they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall put forth fresh feathers like the molting eagle they shall put forth fresh feathers like the molting eagle he said it's been a common and popular opinion that the eagle lives and retains his vigor to a great age and that beyond the common lot of other birds he molts in his old age like and renews excuse me he molts in his old age and renews his feathers and with them his youth in the latin work of saint ambrose the translation of his thought is this the eagle lives to a very advanced age and in molting his youth is renewed with new feathers when i woke up this morning the lord asked me to sing that song for our visiting brother who i don't know he went on as i lay there a few moments he began to talk to my heart again and remind me of this period of molting where the eagle gets weary and worn out it happens to some in advanced age spiritually it can happen to those of us who have been serving the lord for a long period of time whether we're old or not there is an ancient rabbi whose name is sadius and this was what he wrote about the eagle and if you can make it this far please stay with me now put your heart and attention here for just a moment because i believe this is what this day is about it's about launching some of us into a place where we begin to see new feathers i hope that don't sound too weird where we begin to see new feathers forming in the place of old battered bloody torn worn out feathers we see god bringing some of us out of a mulching period and renewing our strength renewing our vim our vigor our anointing our passion to lift him up to exalt him not only with our lives our words but also with our lives the rabbi said this he said it doesn't have to be an in an old age his his observation was at every tenth year the eagle flies near the sun and when not able any longer to bear the burning heat that means he goes up as high as he can go she falls down into the sea and soon loses her feathers and thus renews her vigor this she does every tenth year till the hundredth when after she has ascended near the sun and fallen into the sea she rises no more how much proof do such stories require whether the notion of the eagles renewing his youth is in any degree well founded or not i need not inquire he said it is enough for a poet whether profane or sacred to have the authority of popular opinion to support an image introduced for illustration or for ornament so the rabbi is saying if you don't believe the eagle this happens to the eagle no problem this is my observation this is what i believe so i don't know how often it happens out there in the natural but i know that it happens very often in the spiritual because it's happened in my life the eagle gets weary he gets worn out he gets weighted down with the pressures of life a crust forms on his face and over his is be aquarius where he breathes it begins to crust over his feathers that once stood out and lay so beautifully arranged so beautiful and well oiled so that he could just shed all kinds of water anything he could go right down into the water take a fish and fly in the oil of those wings those feathers would just cause that water to go we used to shed things come on we used to shed things a whole lot easier back then in our life than we do now it seems the enemy are you with me seems the enemy wants to cause us to hold on to things and things to hold on to us the old preacher bobby thompson who preached these things about the eagle baptist preacher who preached these things about the eagle all over the country message people got a hold of it years back 30 years back because it's so related to the life that brother branham told us we had as eagles in his own personal testimony you you would have to question him but his own personal testimony was that he sat just outside of cherokee north carolina was taken there by a special cherokee friend and observed with binocular binoculars i don't know why i said it that way he observed for himself old eagles going through this molting period where they were down in the valley unable to fly no strength in their wings couldn't breathe properly because their beak crusted over bloody beaten bruise broken he said himself this is his testimony as he sat there with his indian friend and god he called his attention to the fact that here come eagles young strong hunting eagles who had taken fresh prey when an eagle gets down and out discouraged and broken in that molting period he can't kill for himself he can't dig for himself his talons are brittle and broken he couldn't catch a rabbit if a rabbit hopped around him in circles it's only a matter of time i've been there i've been there where you couldn't feed yourself didn't matter who was eating around you you couldn't feed yourself didn't matter how much of the word was available to you you couldn't feed yourself you felt ashamed of yourself because you couldn't eat you couldn't take in god's word and be renewed and strengthened by it you just couldn't do it it might have been in one of those periods of your life like i went through where i packed up all the tapes in a box put them up in the top of the closet and said there are just too many things i can't understand so i'll leave all those truths up there for another time and then you have god come by and say the second time in my life the answer to everything you need is found in that box up there that you put up on the shelf then if you're so dumb that you don't dig that out and let god use that word to feed you and sustain you you'll be like those old eagles down there in the bottom who refuse to eat and die don't ever be that way if god speaks to you and says your answers in a sermon you will find the sermon if god said i want to use somebody to speak to you you go find the somebody hello don't run from it run toward it with everything you've got but these old eagles couldn't hunt anymore they couldn't find their fresh prey anymore so so they hand him the binoculars and point out in the sky here are some younger eagles circling the sky they have darted down and caught a fresh rabbit are you listening taking up some fresh prey ripped it apart with those talons skinned it good because they understand the condition of those eagles down in that valley of death they know they're never going to have the strength to catch their own or to or or to take apart their own and so bobby thompson said with his own eyes he observed those young eagles swooping low over that valley he was they were pointed out at first he couldn't even recognize all the eagle there were so many of them there in that valley and he said he was told by the indians that that valley had been known for generations as a valley where eagles go to die he began to see how many there were there were quite a few and here come those sweeping eagles down over tops of their head dropping down rabbit flesh fresh meat spiritual food in due season and fools on purpose so those little eagles who couldn't kill for themselves or feed for themselves it was given to them i have had those eagles i have had those in my life that god used to fly over my life to drop down something that i could eat and remind myself that i was not ordained to die in that valley but then i was called to soar above everything how will i get up how will i get back bobby thompson said then the eagle then the indian tells him said look there across the hill almost even where we are and he zoomed in and he saw some eagles that were climbing out of that valley they didn't have the strength yet to fly out but the fresh meat had given them enough strict strength to climb out and he said they were using their wings like elbows i don't doubt it because when you get desperate enough when you get desperate enough you'll do everything within your power to get back to where you once had a birth come on you'll do everything within your power to get back to the rock from where you were born and that's what that eagle was doing he was headed him come on now i gotta stop but i gotta finish first he was getting back so he's getting more bloody he's getting more scarred more broken more wounded but he's got just enough strength and he's climbing up like we've sung here many times i'm climbing up the rough side of the mountain he realized i can't wait for somebody to take me back to the rock i can't wait on my friend i can't wait on my wife i can't wait on my children i can't wait on my pastor to get me back i've got to get back to the rock where i was born are you with me and so he makes it he makes it some do [Music] the bitter truth is some don't he makes it and the first thing he does is he lays his head against that rock and they tell us or they told him and i've read it a couple other places i've got several books back there on eagles where stories similar to this are told which makes me believe there's some truth to it that that eagle is looking for the rock where his mama had a nest he's trying to get back she's trying to get back to that high place most of you know that eagles mate for life and generally unless there's some change in the in the la lay of the land they nest in the same spot and so it's something they recognize and in most cases when mama doesn't mate and lay up eggs anymore one from that one of her children will go back and start building their nest there and laying their eggs there they're very very territorial type birds and so it's true that he's really trying to get back to the place where his mother once nursed him fed him and took care of him where he was born that rock jesus christ we all see the typology of that then he lays his head against that rock takes that beak and begins to scrape it on that rock back and forth back and forth he scrapes his beak on that rock one of the things that makes the eagle's vision so outstanding it's where its eyes are positioned on its head they're positioned on the side of its head if you look at the eagle you see how the face is shaped he's got an eye on one side and eye on the other side and that helps give him amazing peripheral vision and so you see he's having to cover up one eye to scrape that beak but he's scraping it on one side he's turning his head he's scraping it on another side because literally this old crusty deposit is taking his life it's choking out his breath it's seeking to kill him but all he has to do is scrape it on the rock you with me in a message letting off the pressure paragraph 40. skip down to paragraph 41. this certain kind of an eagle when he begins to get old he gets weary like all of us old people and he gets a crust over his head and he gets so weary he don't know what to do and now the bible said the eagle renews his youth so i studied about this fellow and when he gets old and weary and that crust all over his head he flies as high as he can go until he finds a great high rock and that's assuming that he's able to do so he sets down by the side of this rock and he sits there and beats his head on this rock instead of beating your brains out on the wall because you can't take any more pressure there's a way church there's a way little bride to let off the pressure and that is to beat your head [Music] scrape your beak on the rock till all that crust is gone he said beats his head on that rock what he's trying to do what he's trying to do beat the crust off all the crust and the blood will fly out of his head he goes through all kinds of torture but it's long oh listen i know i've wearied you out today but please hear this but as long as he can feel some of that crust on him he's got to get that off he'll run himself nearly crazy trying to beat himself nearly senseless trying to get every bit of that crust off so he beats it on the rock he just keeps beating it until all the crust is off his head and as soon as all of his crust is off his head though he's bleeding wounded he just screams to the top of his voice he lets off the pressure bobby thompson said that eagle he saw it scraping its beak on that rock and then he lay over lay roll over like an animal and begin to twist his head in a way you wouldn't imagine pulling out every bloody feather the only way to get a new one in was to get the old one out make any sense you heard these two sisters tell us today don't you hold that grudge or even preach it don't you hold on to that the only way to get a new feather in is to pull the old bloody one out and there he goes he goes to work he must look kind of silly when he's done have you ever had a dog you're proud of and then send him to the groomers and come back and you just you ain't much you trim all that fluff off and there ain't nothing left but a little noodle looking thing there in the middle nobody could love that but you just like a mama right right charity you cut all that off and you got this little skinny thing there left you just can't hardly wait for you couldn't hardly wait to get it all cut off you can't hardly wait for it all to grow back you may not can relate to that you can relate to a bad haircut brothers you ever had a bad one couldn't wait to get it all off couldn't wait to get it all back on you ever sat in the chair and considered asking him could you glue some of that back on the side of my head so i didn't look like i was fighting for my life he must look a sight he's beat his head on the rock and dilly and nearly silly now he's plucked out every bloody feather and there he sits with only part of his feathers but the only way he can grow new one is to get rid of the owens and the only way you can look renewed and look better and be a new creature strengthened and and starting over is to look like this this is part of the process you old beaten battered soldier of the cross you took lick after lick after lick and you have looked worse for the wear but your brighter day is ahead if you remember who you are if you get back to the rock where you were born pluck out every one of those old bloody feathers in bobby thompson said then he saw him taking their their talons scraping them on that old rock until the broken uh brittle tips would fall off the only way to grow new strong claws was to scrub off the old ones i find it amazing how these two men brother branham a prophet of god bobby thompson a independent baptist preacher describe these events so similar in the sense that bobby thompson you can hear it it's out there on the internet he said that eagle after he got all that done he made his way over to the edge of that rock he throwed up his head in the air and he said i was able to zoom in the indian said you got to zoom in close and he said i was able to zoom in and he said i myself saw the tears some sort of liquid secreted from the glands of that eagle's eye come running down his face and he preached about the cleansing power of tears of which we're all we all understand i saw this week of something going around on facebook that reminded me of the message that brother perry greene preached so many years ago the night of sister royale's horrible accident he was preaching that message that night on tears and how that the chemistry of tears is different related to the emotion that causes that tear and now science is advanced and i saw a comparison picture maybe you saw it too examining the different tears tears of sorrow tears of joy tears of laughter tears of pain and the molecular structure of those tears so different that it's very easy to distinguish the different tear and the different makeup of the tear because of the i believe it i believe that's how fearfully and wonderfully made we are i believe this is one of the reasons why we shut we shut our bodies down when we hold on to all these things instead of letting them out i tell you my mama used to tell me and her mother used to tell me before sometimes you just need a good cry men don't seem to relate to that as easy as a woman but i would just like to tell some of you brothers that that's exactly what we all need sometimes it's a leaky head we just need to let off the pressure brother richard and i we've got that down we can do that you may not understand it but it may be our only way of survival i'm standing in that studio friday greeting the saints in in arizona i'm as happy as i can be and i start choking up and the tears start coming and i can't even see them all i see is a camera standing in front of me but it was like i was standing in front of them and so sorry that i couldn't be there in person that i couldn't help the tears from coming oh god don't ever let us get so hard that we can't let off the pressure and bobby thompson said he saw that eagle after those tears flowed down his face said he went out to the to the end of that uh rock tilted his head up toward the sun and let out a ah i know that wasn't the best eagle call you've ever heard somewhere between a crow and whatever it's my best attempt what was he doing he was letting off the pressure what was he doing he was glorifying his creator for bringing him back to the rock yes hallelujah he goes on brother branham said why let off the pressure screams at the top of his voice why because as soon as all the crust is off musicians are coming then he renews his youth it's sure to come so as soon as all the crust is gone he can start screaming because he knows that he's got rid of god help us today oh god help us in this house today oh god help us in the nations of the world today oh god help every streamer today to get all the crust the residue of yesterday's trial heartache grief pain circumstance i felt a spirit of prophecy earlier in the service and i didn't yield to it at that moment not to be disobedient but to be appropriate and i heard god saying in the spirit to somebody i will restore saith the lord would you claim that i don't know particularly who it's for but i heard that vote i will restore my mind immediately went to the thief being caught in the act and i heard the voice of the spirit again calling out i will restore everything that has been stolen from your life stolen finances somebody said why do you mention that first it's the least important i didn't choose the order stolen finances because of broken promises and broken covenants and broken contracts i heard him say i will restore all that the enemy has stolen from you spiritually he's calling us back today as believers back to the rock where we beat our head against the solid rock and we scrape our beak until all of the crust is gone because he wants to restore i sensed in my spirit that the enemy had convinced some that you had come to the end there were precious promises that god had made to you along the way that you would never see the fulfillment of but i want to tell you in the name of the lord it's like the brown bear timing is everything someone said recently what's timing got to do with anything nothing for the unbeliever but for the believer timing is everything knowing god's will is only half the battle knowing what god wants to do is only half the battle but we've got to discern the timing and the truth is brother sister we've just got the timing off we've missed the timing no under this the fog blew in with me no wonder the fog blew in changed the hunting trip instead of brother branham going out and getting the brown bear the vision that was promised just passed right through him he said there are many people who have all kinds of ideas of how that will come to pass but i just take brother branham at his word he said it just passed through me [Music] because timing is everything i panicked this morning mary beth wherever she is not that sister laurel couldn't play she plays beautifully and she could have played eagle's wings beautifully but when i was asked to sing that song for our brother something dropped down in my heart that mary beth wants to play it and so i don't know why and so i sent uh benjamin or joshua one to come and let sister mary beth know that i wanted to play and she thanked us for the heads up and then when there was a little problem with the facebook stream i went to the back i saw her go out the door i assumed she had to go and grab something and i never saw her come back in and i knew by this experience this morning i don't know why you know what i don't have to know why i really have come that far i don't have to know why she had it doesn't matter but i didn't see her come back in and it worried me and i was feeling a little panicky even not because it couldn't go on we could have pulled it off but i wanted it to be exactly like the lord wanted it to be and so i sent joshua a no tonight because i think he's the one that went there and i said where is marabeth and a few minutes later he said she's sitting on the stair back here behind you waiting to play the song you asked her to play see timing i'm thinking where is she somebody go get her how are we gonna god's got everything we get all worried up for nothing if god inspires it he knows how to pull it off i feel led to tell somebody timing is everything i got to finish reading this it's two o'clock wow as soon as all of his crust is off his head though he's bleeding wounded he just screams to the top of his voice he lets off the pressure why because as soon as all that crust is off he renews his youth it's sure to come so as soon as all the crust is gone he can start screaming because he knows that he's got rid of all the crust go on would move to the next paragraph if you would but you know i i know a rock where that we can go and beat in prayer till all the crust of the world is beat away from us till all the unbelief of god's word is beat away till we enter into a place where all things are possible and as soon as we got all the world and unbelief in god's word beat off of us then we can scream and shout because eternal life is sure just as certain as anything certainly because all the world is beat off you got time for one more i don't know if i've got the strength to stand that long but we'll see paragraph 55 as the eagle stirs her nest i want you to stand if you feel able please as an eagle renews his youth yes sir the revival takes and shakes all the old funny feelings away from you the revival takes and shakes all the old funny feelings away from you fly out into an atmosphere yonder likened his heritage to an eagle because the eagle renews his youth now makes him shout you watch the church listen you watch the church it'll be sitting all dry first thing you know the holy spirit strikes them their youth while the old people is just up on their feet jumping and shouting and praising god it renews their youth again he said that's right do anything a young person can do just jump holler scream and shout he renews his youth that's right i believe in that don't you i believe in that i believe in that don't you brother branham is saying what we all need is just a wave of that holy ghost revival to strike our hearts and we're positioning ourselves for such a move when we recognize that we've got to get back to that rock here we are lord jesus standing in your presence a bit of an unusual service bit of an unusual atmosphere yet we know ordained of you you started of the morning laying out a plan i can't make anything happen but i have been obedient to the best of my ability and now i'm asking that you would meet with each heart that you would confirm this word of promise to each one who stands in need of having their spiritual youth renewed oh god we know that you are able to renew our physical strength but we speak of spiritual strength to press on to hope again to believe again to have vision again our eyes have clouded over with the pressures of life we have watched our hopes and dreams be buried in the dirt portions of who we are have given up but there's something down in the inside of the eagle believer that can never give it all up it cries out for reality hallelujah it cries out for relationship for renewal to breathe better to see better to fly better lord bobby thompson told us that when that eagle gets his feathers back he lives up on that rock until everything's better and the first thing he does when he's through is he goes down through that valley of sailing catches a rabbit rips it apart in his sharpened talons and drops it down for those other struggling eagles left behind god's great cycle lord jesus there's nothing like a testimony of where god brought somebody back from to feed to inspire to encourage somebody else that if i can get out of that valley you can too if that man can beat his way back if that sister can get out of that place whoa then i can too help us lord just play something would you we're not leaving yet i'm not doing this with any motive in mind god knows me today he let me find this in my notes and i'm going to read it this was a note sent to me by a sister in this church who had been in our prayer meetings that we were having once a week this is a mom with children family a husband in the church she writes what i was trying to say in prayer meeting was that even though the enemy has hovered and flown over us trying to distract hinder and even harm the eagles are flying too and the mighty eagle is among us strong and powerful he is answering us and giving us wisdom we will continue to walk together in the prophetic and find grace and faith to do so no matter what the devil tries to throw at us the devil tried sending some major hindrances our way at this time last year which we are still dealing with today but we are moving forward and finding a new season this place has been a place of the prophetic the anointing and the word it's what has drawn many here it's still here and i believe it will increase and we will be able to discern the enemy's moves and attacks sooner and put him down sooner i know i have been in a battle since early last year but i feel so much grace and encouragement knowing he is moving and we are in him he will take us all the way if we keep yielding only to him and his word i won't read my response but i will read her final comment thank you for leading us all and praying for us we are overcomers and we are climbing mount zion to that completeness in him and i want you to hear this last phrase that mother's in this service today i want you to hear this last phrase she said thank you for leading us all in praying for us we are overcomers and climbing mount zion to that completeness in him i want you to listen to this last phrase she said it's why i was born why the lord let me find that it's never been read in church it was shared with me in a text why the lord let me find that this morning i don't even really fully understand but i want you to know i believe every word of it and i believe that it came from a heart that god was moving in and working in and desiring to bring up to that place of completeness and perfection in him that battle has greatly increased since that day but the truth remains the same we are overcomers by the blood of the lamb so my prayer today is that for this sister and for every one of us that we will keep our eyes on the lord find a way find a way brother find a way sister to get back to the rock where you were born again and don't allow the enemy to keep you from pressing the battle if nobody understands you if nobody gets you if nobody can help you on the journey you get a good old look at jesus christ and don't you turn your head to the right or to the left no matter what the enemy throws against you rise above it somebody rise above it in the name of the lord rise above it the healing is here [Music] let's worship the lord

everything we need to overcome in this hour to break off all that binds us to this earth that we might be lifted up into those prepared places you have prepared places in the realm of the spirit for your bride and it is our desire to move in those places of glory and realms of glory to be refreshed and renewed and strengthened in this last hour as we win the greatest battle ever fought by taking you at your word keep us oh god keep us oh god just play that we're so happy that you are here with us today we miss so many but we're so glad you're here what a great joy for brother steve and sister anita to be with us today it's just like a gift has been given to us and how we appreciate that and i don't want to start calling names but i because i know people make sacrifices all the time and we don't maybe think of it to mention it but i so appreciate josh and charity for coming all the way home from virginia yesterday so that they could be in the service today and help us i know many of you have done that many times and i appreciate that but also know how easy it is when you're that far away on a saturday just to say well we'll take another night and we'll travel home on sunday but we needed them here today and i'm so glad that they made that sacrifice our brother from florida what a what a great distance he has most likely come and we are very honored that he has done that i sort of tried to let him off the hook a little and i told him there'd be a lot of folks out and maybe he would wait want to wait to another time he said no i i made my plans and i'm coming and i'm so glad he did and i pray god is ministered to him in some way and uh let's see there was one other thing that came in my mind we'll be here tuesday night at seven o'clock and unless the lord speaks between now and tuesday night differently we will not be meeting here on friday night for a watch night service but you have the great grace of god in the freedom to gather together and to pray in your homes however god would lead you but i just just felt a little different leadership and i'm not sure what that is about it's happened that way before we want to be obedient to him but it's a wonderful thing we know that we are living by a bible calendar not a pope calendar but we also have watched how that god emphasizes things as the year changes i think it's people start looking for some change and when you look for change you can find it and uh everything that you have done for us we appreciate it so much there were some brothers who came yesterday to help benjamin [Music] prepare a place for he and his bride to live and they sacrificed their day these are really people who don't celebrate christmas or they wouldn't have took christmas day to come and lay flooring i'm not going to call their name because i don't want to do that and leave someone out but thank you so much for helping us i am not brother branham i'm not a not a messenger but like that but i know what he meant when he said if you love me then do something nice for my family i know what that makes you feel like and i appreciate that very much let's see what the lord has for us in this new season pray safety over those who travel god bring them back to us safely i hope that god has used brother greeley today and to bless his dad's congregation i always think about him when he's ministering there thank you for your patience today we're going to let you go in the name of the lord i i just i feel like something's a little unfinished but i can't find what it is so i'm just gonna i'm not gonna hold you while i decide and may god bless you as you slip out today in his wonderful oh i know i know what i wanted to say brother minkow and his family back there in the back they have been coming now for some time driving how far is it brother to for you to get here on a sunday because of where they're staying now they had to move out of their home because of the circumstances of the of mold etc some of you have dealt with that they're now staying temporary with our sister's mother i believe is right and it's two hours they've driven two hours to be here this morning they'll turn around and drive two hours back and they've been coming it's been a little over an hour from where they were staying i think before and i'm saying that to let you know that as long as they're abiding with us and worshiping with us they're part of us anything you can do to make their journey smoother they need a place to live they're they're asking about a place to live and nobody wants to stay with her mother-in-law too long i don't think as good as the mother-in-law might be he's really got his hand up he's right there even as even sister minko said that's just it's hard to find a house big enough for two folks two families like that but may god give them what they desire and if there's anything you can do if you can offer them a meal on that journey or if you felt led to press a gas money in their hand or anything like that well you just be obedient to the lord but i wanted you to know that i have not failed to notice the sacrifice i notice that they're always on time at least by the time i come out they're always here i think my they do better than some of our folks who live may god bless you you're dismissed to go in the name of the lord save you're worthy of honor and glory worthy of all of our praise [Music] [Applause] you overcame [Music] jesus awesome in power forever [Music] awesome and great is your name [Music] you overcame [Music] [Music] [Music] you
