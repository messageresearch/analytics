name we're getting ready to turn the service over to brother Brooks we don't want to lose this atmosphere if you want to start making your way back to your seat for just a moment we are not going to receive an offering now we're going to ask you to stand if you're not standing for just one moment we're not going to receive an offering we have brother Dwayne Jackson here tonight and we want to hear from him in song but we're going to wait on that just a moment or two the acquire the young people had a song tonight we're going to wait on that for just a little while we're not going to take any time to make apologies for a service it's not a runaway service don't say that it hadn't gone anywhere but where God wanted it to go and you know what like little ducks we're just following along oh don't say you gonna follow the pillar of fire and then when he comes don't follow him and so I don't I won't don't want to take time to say all the things that could be said at A Moment Like This the Lord will take care of the offering we'll get to hear from Brother Jackson we'll get to hear from the choir but right now we're going to invite brother Brooks to come and Minister the word of God to be obedient to the Holy Spirit and we're so happy that you're here we'll say more about that later that little lady that was getting prayer up here in the front she's still there somewhere I haven't seen her in 30 years and yet somehow I recognized her and I said to her granddaughter is this Dora and it's been many many years since I've seen her she's in desperate need and I believe there you are I believe the Lord has touched Dora tonight God bless you Sister she's been streaming the services lately brother Brooks come and obey the Lord whatever he bids you to do do it and I promise you we will be right behind you then sings my soul myself [Music] how great Thou Art [Music] how great now [Music] then sing my song [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes it is [Music] let's say that just again didn't see my soul my sin your God to the [Music] our Grace down [Music] [Music] [Music] I agree [Music] I just had to sing that I've been praying and just praying that God would have his way I remember the time when the prophet of God was in Mexico and this little Woman's baby died and the man of God told someone else to go pray trying to keep order then all of a sudden he had a vision and he saw that little Mexican baby in mid-air laughing at him you see what I'm saying what God when God wants to change the Order of Things we change with God and what I've been praying for God has is just his presence I don't think people realize it's More Than A Feeling it's absolutely the pill of fire god in the place and sometimes we we can miss our blessings because the devil will always have you skeptical but when that Spirit comes you're supposed to move with haste into the anointing of God don't leave these meetings without your Victory because he's here brother Brooks can't do one thing for you Hallelujah no minister of God can do a thing for you and with all the preaching we preach to get that kind of anointing in the place and we want to always let God hallelujah have his way hey those of you who did get prayer prayer for prayed for just remember it's not a feeling it's about faith and if you had enough Faith to come up to get prayed for you should take the same faith and take your victory go back to your seat with the same faith that's what gives you the victory right there Hallelujah may God help me tonight I as we stand we do thank God for my brother Shelley we're getting right on into the word people of God we ask that you turn with us to First Corinthians I love Calvary I love Calvary I love what he did for me and I don't think that a lot of people still understand what he did for us yes amen and we're not just going to preach on Calvary but we're going to preach on what God Calvary did for us we always talk about the lamb taking the book but the lamb could not have taken the book had it not been for Calvary Hallelujah and why did he go as we stand let's let's before I go any further let's turn to First Corinthians the 15th chapter I love this anointing we can jump we can shout and all that's good maybe we'll get a little bit of that in before we leave but uh what we want to understand is that when the Holy goes when God comes in the way he it's it's amazing because there are so many places you can go to and not yet feel this anymore come on come on they have become void of the spirit and presence of the Lord it is not about the depth the depth of the word is all good but at the end of the day that word is supposed to bring you to him Hallelujah you love the Lord amen First Corinthians the 15th chapter I am a worshiper of the word the word is my God and whatever the words say I will bow to it [Music] I will say Amen to the word of God that's what we need to understand it was a word in the beginning and it must be the word in the ending 57th verse verse let's start at the fifth and fifth verse I love that oh death where is thy staying oh grave where is thy victory The Sting of death is sin which is unbelief and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ therefore my beloved Brethren listen to this be unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as ye know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord amen let's pray father I thank you once again Lord I don't even know how to behave myself right now thank you for your presence yes thank you for what you've done thus far Lord we love you Jesus and father we pray that you have thine own way let your words speak to every heart don't spare us our feelings amen or anything we need you tonight to take us to another level in you be merciful to us oh God and we will give you the praise Glory and Honor expose the darkness in our lives and set us free in your lovely name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated Hallelujah God is more than able hey he will do and can do uh exceedingly abundantly above whatsoever we ask or think you know I was thinking and I've been praying God speak to our hearts because we need a man to see where we air we understand perfection and the only perfect one is you and father we need your perfection we need you to destroy the yokes and the bondages the things that keep holding us back it is not what the message is all about this whole week has been on Victory knowing that we have it but it's like a pardon a pardon is not a pardon except to be accepted as a pardon and victory is not something you win it's something that God has won for you but the only way comes Victory is that you must accept it Hallelujah and in every time a victory there's always a celebration is that right when John saw that the lamb had taken the book and the lamb was worthy he shouted in Victory and this is way I believe amen when when the devil tries to overtake us we understand he cannot because our destiny has already been predetermined God God because we chose him he chose us we don't have to fear anything that the devil brings I was thinking when Paul preached oh death whereas I sting I thought about the times that when people die the first thing we want to do is call the people of the morgue we're going to call the the ambulance and stuff like that instead the early church the early church Stood Still and they wanted to find out is this the will of God y'all hear what I'm saying they wanted to know is this the will of God or is Satan playing a trick but we are so even now afraid of death to when death comes we don't even have enough Faith to believe that God can resurrect help with somebody you're going to either believe all of the word or don't believe none at all it's just like Jesus said and then when he said to Mary and Martha if you believe me you will see the resurrection she says Lord we know that the resurrection is coming but Jesus says no no no no that's not the way you should believe not coming is now I am the resurrection I I am the life Hallelujah and one thing you said well oh brother Miss what are you saying let me say it like this your Prophet my Prophet believe that God could raise the Dead [Music] Hallelujah that's what we taught and that's what we need to believe [Music] we must understand that God has given us the victory in everything Hallelujah we shouldn't fear nothing whatever comes our way we must understand oh God give me the victory no he has already given you the victory but you must accept it Hallelujah but you know what we do we look at circumstances Hallelujah we look at conditions the word of God doesn't look at conditions Hallelujah Mary mother says Lord Lazarus is over there he's been dead for days he's stinking hallelujah amen how you're going to raise that up oh somebody help me but Jesus says I am the resurrection I am the life if you just roll away the stone of unbelief you shall see it you shall have be a witness that I am the resurrection [Applause] to this day I don't know how she they rolled the stone away with one thing for certain about faith When Faith is applied there's nothing impossible somebody help me here so you must realize with the pride of Jesus Christ we're born of his bone oh we're flush of his flesh Hallelujah the same Ministry he had it's the same Ministry we have okay let down on the word the word is God when you are a worshiper of the word you'll realize the word is God you don't speak the word and say well I hope it's going to happen the problem with us is that we fear that God will not keep his promises Hallelujah now I don't know about you but the prophet of God tells us that they're coming a time when limbs will go back y'all hear me that's the kind and that's the way I believe it Hallelujah I know it's not by power it's not by my mind but it is by his spirit and I do not doubt God the word because the word is perfect and if it says it's possible it's possible but yet and still we struggle with things that we shouldn't we are we should be in a place of maturity hello but the problem is we allowed ourselves to be distracted y'all hear what I'm saying even Samson knew amen that what he he was ordained for and that was to destroy the Philistine which was a which was a a church of unbelief Hallelujah and you and I must understand that we have been ordained to manifest faith to manifest the word in a way of belief now you can't be helped if you are enjoying your demons [Music] hello that's what's wrong with some Christians they're still in Joy they're demons Hallelujah but I'm gonna tell you something about a demon he will or they will destroy your soul if you don't destroy it it will destroy you oh come on somebody when you think about where we are we're so close to the translation but let me tell you something because you don't see the majority of the people moving into that channel let me tell you something God has never left himself without a witness and because you don't see it in other people listen I'm not looking to see it in other people I want to see it in me Hallelujah I want to know that the resurrection is in me because if I should go to the Grave I want to know that I've got the goods that's going to get me up Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying but your problem is we have people that will set right in church and don't know that they are demon anointed by demons [Music] y'all hear what I'm saying it's the truth you get a people or person that would come in the Church of God not everybody don't have to act alike but you can tell when you have uh uh what you call a person that Satan has literally placed in the church to stop the flow of the anointing I'm sure everybody's got them Hallelujah they're not willing to get into the anointing themselves but they're there to stop it but they're not aware of it they're not aware of it but that's a demon as I've heard before that's a no worship demon a no praise demon Hallelujah but when you come into presence of the Lord ah you better be careful because he's a king and when you come into the presence of the king it says enter his gates with Thanksgiving into his cause with praise Hallelujah oh it's true you find that people are so still attracted to the world you've got to die you got to rot if you could only understand what's coming your way it's worse than the tidal wave you understand me when you see the flood of devils that was loosed in the in the from the river Euphrates and how they're moving into their channel to bring an attack on the Bride of Jesus Christ in ought to put you in a spirit of desperation Hallelujah because no flesh will be able to stand against these devils you say oh brother Brooks I'm standing let me tell you something about those Devils they are very intellectual they're very smart and they're Devils of science you hear what I'm saying so let me just say a few little things before I go any further when it comes to science we realize hey man it was a science who destroyed the world in antaluian day is that right and as I said the other night it was God who saved Mankind from science and we're living in a world where they worship science even to this day understand is good and evil but if you're not careful you'll find yourself letting science work evil rather than good Hallelujah you know what I'm saying I appreciate the car Hallelujah because there was a time we had to walk but understand if you watch that science you better be careful because you can have an automobile and your house will be just not even a block away and instead of walking we jump in the car and we go to the store which do what make you weaker [Music] it literally takes away the strength of your body y'all better hear what I'm saying see science is something else it's like a serpent if you're not careful Hallelujah right how many times you let me say it like this we used to America used to go hunt for our food and when you would go hunt you had to kill it you had to dress it process it did bring it home Hallelujah you used your body and it kept you strong what about science how the Medics and you know medicine everywhere that the medicine is also made us weak Hallelujah because we don't get into the all of the germs and the stuff out there oh we just wash everything there's nothing wrong with being clean Hallelujah but you must understand amen as we uh continue to open the door to science it makes us weaker that's true the only you know I shop yeah I go hunting but it's in the grocery store Holly so you got to understand I appreciate the grocery stores yeah I tried to do a little hunting this last year you know some deer and some you know and and you know and I found out turkeys are not done this the way we used to be but God said it he purposed it to be this way the reason why amen because he wants you to understand there's nothing you can do outside of believing what he can do for you oh I'm coming let me hurry up by God's grace because I'm not going to preach long life like I did last night but I want you to understand by God's grace is that God has given us the victory let's let's say that tonight God has given us the victory Hallelujah listen the Bible tells us that Abraham's daggered not at the promises of God now I wonder I want to really give you a visual of things that of the impossible so that you can see that God is still the same and he can make those things that's impossible possible Hallelujah you say oh brother the Lord let me see I've dropped out see let me tell you something what science did I have to go back because that's what he told me so you got to realize by God's grace science is the thing that caused the world's pollution right and let me break it down to you there was a time there was a district where unclean women would be and you had the journey to that District there was a time amen that unclean books oh come on y'all getting quiet you giving yourself away Hallelujah because those unclean books and that people had their duck and Dodge and run and hide just to get them but science Hallelujah has placed it on what we call an iPhone [Applause] Hallelujah you don't have to go nowhere you can just hit buttons and the filth of the world will come right on your screen y'all hear what I'm saying and there are those in here who are addicted and you need Deliverance and God can and God will Hallelujah now he told me he reminded me to say that because there must be somebody in here that needs to be delivered from pornography and all that wicked stuff oh y'all getting quiet but God knows who you are oh and the thing about it you come up in prayer but you're not ready to surrender Hallelujah you can't get this victory until you surrender Hallelujah oh come on somebody it's the truth oh that can't be among us it is you love the Lord the word is a deliverer and if you want to be delivered tonight you can be delivered hallelujah amen why do you think that presence was that was in here earlier still yet but now you got to understand he didn't come to make you feel good he came to deliver you and for those of us who need the Holy Ghost he come to give you the Holy Ghost let me tell you something you can be a monk on a mountain top with all by yourself and if you're not converted the devil is there with you and let me tell you something about the mind the Mind knows how to imagined evil you can't get rid of the devil until you get Jesus on the inside and then when you have Christ he's still going to knock on your door but at that time you tell him you got the wrong house you got the wrong number Hallelujah desperation that's what we need we need to be more desperate and let me tell you something this is the devil's tricks you know that right even in the days of Sodom he made them think it was okay the the Sun was shining the birds were singing everything seemed normal except one thing they got their warning they got a warning that they should have taken heed to but they did not but when the fire fell it was too late you understand me let me tell y'all something we've got the World Council of churches in all of these systems that are going to work against us and if you don't have the Holy if you missed the rapture I'm talking about people in this message you Mr rapture you have no idea the torment that you're going to have because you fail to move and trust God to deliver you from whatever that darkness is hallelujah amen understand it is the little foxes that spoils the Vine I've been doing anything that that's really gross to everybody but it's just that little thing of selfishness gnosticism when everything's got to go your way hello when everything must have something to do with you or you don't want to have nothing to do with it oh we don't have that kind in the church yes we do Hallelujah you know it's amazing you got a pastor and you got songs to sing what they don't like Hallelujah glory to God I don't know who you are but I'm a preacher just like he want me to preach it you better understand when you come into the house of the king you supposed to handle yourself yeah Hallelujah oh it's your truth we got people and you don't even know stubbornness as as witchcraft you don't understand you're being Anointed with the Witchcraft Spirit just by being stubborn oh my Daddy's starving my mother's stubborn and I guarantee you they won't make heaven without if they continue to be that way and neither will you God help me Jesus you better understand you got so many people in and you know I think I'm a pastor I've been a pastor for years now and everywhere you go you find almost the same people just with different faces it's the truth it's the truth and you think oh my God I tell you what I've heard so much stuff among people that's Acclaim to be the message I couldn't believe that people in the message could do it you see that's not it they might be in the message but the message has never gotten into them Hallelujah you've got to an egg this is what I'm trying to tell you you can be married to a system Hallelujah you can dress right you can wear your hair alone you can do all those things but let me tell you something that's not going to assure you in heaven you must be born again Hallelujah of the water and the spirit is that right this is what I love about it when John introduced Jesus or talked about him he said he shall come with the baptism Hallelujah the baptism of what but people don't want fire you give me your fire I want the fire of the Holy Ghost I want them to burn every demon away from me yeah that's right the Bible says in this last day and then the prophet God said the Holy Ghost and Fire should burn every demon away from you Hallelujah is that right in the future home Hallelujah he said the world gets a fire baptism he said that is a shadow and the type of the baptism that every individual must go through you don't have a choice oh I'm scared of that Holy Ghost Hallelujah yes because you know what it takes you out of control as long as you think you're gonna be in control you won't get nothing God like if I could say it like this he like to make you look like a fool hmm he took Israel which one was one of the most starchest people ever Hallelujah come on you can't get more starches in Israel when it came to the law and he chose them and took them up into the upper room they've never been like that before everything was one two three four five six however everything was pristine everything was just perfect and here come the Holy Ghost somebody they did not have to worry about it they did not to have to they didn't have to have anyone to tell them it was the Holy Ghost when that fire came down they began to jump they began to shout they began to speak in tongues Hallelujah and guess what they didn't keep it in the church the problem of God said they jumped out of the windows you got a window we can jump out of they had you understand what I'm saying the anointing he said the anointing the upper room now think about it the upper room it wasn't on the first level they jumped out of the windows running up and down the street saying he's alive he's alive he's alive Hallelujah and that's what I say tonight he's alive he's alive he's alive God is still God Hallelujah and what he did yesterday he's doing it today let me tell you all something here's the secret we did not come to a movie show this is not our acting but if you got into the anointing of the spirit you'll get what you want tonight you better hear what I'm saying y'all hear what I'm saying the property God preached a message getting into the spirit he said now if you had a football game or basketball game and somebody make a touchdown you don't say whoo boy that was really nice now Hallelujah you get into that spirit Hallelujah and you out of your seat the Holy Ghost does the same thing there have been times the Holy Ghost hit me I'm about to my seat running and I'm all the way down the hall when I come to my senses what is it getting into the spirit of God hallelujah we can't sit still I can't stand it you go to a message church and listen if you're not careful you gotta fight for this you gotta fight for it the devil will try to depress you he'll try to make you feel funny he'll isolate you and make you feel like you're stupid let me tell you something you just have to feel stupid sometimes yes it doesn't matter the whole church it's not worshiping God but the Lord hit you you need to do what you need to do Hallelujah y'all hear what I'm saying this break traditions this break traditional God help us here tonight don't be concerned about your tradition because those Traditions make the word of God of non-effects so true let me say it like this many of you have not gotten the victory in God because you don't love him like you say you do Faith or love working by faith working by love when you love God it produces faith it brings action Hallelujah do you know when you love God it takes away the fear of what other peoples think about you y'all understand me because you shouldn't care about what it ain't none of their business that's between you and him Hallelujah you love the Lord oh my we must studying the Lord said that some of you got still about baby mentality the baby mentality right you're always reaching out for something huh you're not a giver your taker [Music] Hallelujah and people don't even think you love them until you just give them all the time that's a baby mentality you need to grow up who's that famous man who said ask not what your country can do for you that was Kennedy but that's what you can do for your country ask not what your church can do for you but ask what you can do for your church [Music] it's the truth everybody say I love God and so I'm going to hit something now because he just told me to I love a lot and let me tell you something there should not be a poor person in here a person in need let me put it that way because all we're poor is always be with you but when it comes to the knees of the church [Music] oh wait a minute now I'm gonna get Mia Benson what they call it Benson one of them fantasy cars deadly that's it you see I don't know nothing about it foreign Hallelujah but you have people in your church you understand me now God ain't gonna make you do it but the Holy Ghost will make you do it it'll make you give oh come on somebody to give [Music] should not be one in this church who's lacking food y'all understand what I'm saying you can't just take care of somebody but you can help them the early church they just gave it all up to be equal but it ain't gonna happen in this day we got our rights y'all hear what I'm saying and we'll tell God they'll tell God I got my rights as long as you have your rights you would never be married to him hello don't get quiet that's the truth you got the force in all of your rights oh God help me I hadn't even gotten him a message yet but God but God everybody don't have to be emotional I've been a word that right because everybody need to be emotional because if you're not emotional you're dead so you need some but let me tell you something you know what your emotions were given to you for to worship God Hallelujah your tear ducts were not given to you to cry because you're sad or because of pain your tear ducts gave God gave to you for joy Hallelujah yeah have you ever been so happy and joyous in God till you just start crying and you can't stop yes Hallelujah now let me move on by God's grace amen you know you know a lot of times people think well you know God made me this so I can you know everybody has a gift and a talent I was telling somebody the other day I said you know what if we as a world or Nation could take all the talents of every race and put it all together it'll be like heaven you hear what I'm saying you say well what do you mean let me say it like this there are things that black people can do white people can and there are things that white people can do black people can we shouldn't be jealous of one another we pulled all that together you see what I'm saying oh I love you see I'm like God I love variety I love variety I love the Indians I love the Chinese I love the Japanese I I love everybody and every race is beautiful in itself Hallelujah you know we come and we must learn that we come to do what have a perfect mind yeah the greatest battle ever fought is where in your mind not at your job is in your mind and that's where God allow it to be but he gave you that because he says now listen in that day when the battle is so great I want you to understand I'm giving you a way out let this mind be in you that was also in Christ Jesus if you let my mind into you it will control and kick out everything that's not of me hallelujah amen you know I have to I have to stare because some of y'all look like mannequins back there you smiles move a little bit amen now we must understand by God's grace amen we're living in a Time amen of desperation you know I'm gonna tell y'all something one of the the greatest and I heard brother Benham said it like this he said there'll be many Christians who will miss the Rapture because of their families and you let your family influence you not to be a Christian are you serious if they all want to go way with let them go you know why gonna be one one witness for him it's got to be me [Music] Hallelujah listen I don't take up for nobody if you're wrong you're wrong if you're right you're right whether you be my mother my brother my sister my cousin it does not matter because you know why I see him he's looking at me he's building character in me and the test that comes my way he wants to see whether I love him more than anything and I do not encourage bad habits is it true even my children when they at home and they got their grandkids the grandkids are there and they can't control them they say we're going to tell Grandpa all I have to do is spank my grandkids one time I have no more trouble um yeah I don't have to have to they don't forget right you see when God spank you and spank you in a good way when the Devil comes back with that that that test you the devil said why don't you just do steel let me use that for an example why don't you just go ahead and steal that piece of candy will you remember the weapon you got and you know what you tell the devil you go head on and do it yeah you get me in trouble no more why because you're laughing at me while I'm getting the beaten oh it's the truth the devil will tell you to steal and he'll tell that policeman on the corner he's stealing while he's telling you to steal he's telling the police what you're doing and you get caught and then when you get called he says you're so stupid the truth he gets you in trouble and he jumps out the way like oh you're so stupid and what we need to do is make the devil feel stupid for bringing that kind of thought to our minds I know there's an elementary but I trust you're being blessed by it y'all understand me the blood of Jesus Christ was so powerful it literally saved the whole world can I say that again the blood of Jesus Christ amen is so powerful it literally saved the whole world the only reason why people go to hell is because they refuse to accept the atonement of the blood of Jesus Christ that's it they choose to go that way Hallelujah now let me tell you something what can I do I can't allow Jesus to be a figment of my imagination no so he's got to be real to me y'all see what I'm saying I I came through so many churches amen uh raised Baptists from the Baptist I went to the Methodist from the Methodist I went to the Catholic from the Catholic I went to the apostolic amen and then I came into this message you know why I asked God where are you where are you you know what he told me I'm in my word [Music] see this is why I worship Him you got to understand this is why because I realized everything in yourself stand Hallelujah the word of the Lord shall stand glory to God Amen so we realize we're living in a time and I'm not like I said I'm gonna be long but we're living in a time of Exodus with time how many of y'all believe that yes see if you see that's the trick that's the trick because the devil make you think you got more time isn't that what he did inside them you know I got to finish my house he distracted them he made everything more important than the visitation of the angel y'all understand me that's not it the angel the messenger the word is more important than anything else this is where you focus in order to escape y'all hear what I'm saying when you allow the world Amen to take your attention the devil is trapping you hallelujah oh God help us here because we want to be Victorious and you know what what gets me the anointing was here and you just saw just a few people entering in you know why because the devil told you it wasn't the right order this this and after the word hallelujah oh yeah there were some here it may not have been you but I know what I'm talking about and they stood there in their seats what you need to do and learn to do is whenever the holy spirit is moving you move with it [Applause] Hallelujah God is the order hallelujah oh God help us Jesus we're so indoctrinated sometimes we just don't even understand what God is doing Hallelujah think about it this woman amen was in such a desperation and everybody thrown in Jesus what was the difference people bumping into me because they curious there's like church people they're looking around to see him do something something you know Supernatural but this woman had a need and see when you come to church with a knee you come amen for that need to be met Hallelujah you should never come to church and leave out intent well oh well he I didn't feel him no no no no no no see even when I don't feel it still working Hallelujah even when I don't feel him he's still working when I don't see him he's still working Hallelujah he's always walking Hallelujah yes Lord you say you say well y'all did y'all notice that did you notice how much God liked that song that was God coming down because he liked that song [Applause] Hallelujah y'all understand me when God vindicates something he's it's his approval oh God help us here you know I couldn't help it I'm over there weeping and everything else and like oh my God I'm weeping I'm weeping a muck I'm gonna preach but anyway she was desperate she was so desperate and that's the thing my wife and I have eight children and when my first child went wayward we thought we were going to have a nervous breakdown we cry we cry almost like a month straight because we couldn't understand what went wrong and we went to her one day after things had come back she had come back to the law see because once you understand what I'm saying when you're desperate Satan can trick them but your desperation brings them back is she because God had to teach me something brother Shelley he taught me that I had Pride ain't no way my children not mine will ever go out into the world or backslide not brother Brook's children pride and you know what my love for her was hindered by my pride instead of the grace and love I wanted to bring the law I'm saying that's exactly what a lot of us when your children go and go Pride you're more concerned about what other people are going to think about you and you fail to see the heart that they're going through and the need that they have don't tell me I've been there but when God was able to show me my pride that's when I broke that's when I had to ask him for for my forgiveness and my wife and I went in desperation Hallelujah we didn't went in the prayer and then you know even she's me one thing I can say about her she may not be the strongest of all Christians but she loved this message ending today Hallelujah you say Oh Brother Bruce what are you yes it is it is what it is but you and I must understand by God's grace that the blood covers it all I was in prayer one day and the Lord told me he had given me all of my children and he called them all by name in in their proper order and I can't even do that sometime you know what I'm saying I'm calling day Isaiah I gave Elijah what's your name it gets like that sometimes even with my grandkids I have to think about it [Laughter] it's the truth but you and I must understand by God's grace what God is doing for us you have a kingdom the Bible said that God has made us Kings and Priests therefore God has given you a territory God has given you your family come on somebody God given you to rule over your family Hallelujah and when things get out of order and you can't handle it you go to the high order you go to the King of Kings Hallelujah it's the truth it is what God wants us to do he wants us to sanctify our house [Music] King Sanctified with all kind of TVs and everything kind of thing oh y'all got so quiet on that one yes we gonna look at we're gonna live stream and after live stream what else all I'm saying is if the Holy Ghost won't look at it you better not ain't nothing wrong with things you know that's you know decent and godly but if the Holy Ghost ain't gonna look at it oh you know what I'm saying oh we wouldn't even look at anything that had one the profanity in it now we say you know me y'all think I've never been there I've been there I've been there they have a bad scene in it and you try to fast forward and all you're doing is like y'all know it's true fast forward it's a joke The Flash can never be satisfied we need the tokening oh God help us here oh my what did he do then you got to understand the Holy Ghost when Jesus and I love this oh I just wish I could act it out I I wish I could act it out because you know I could see him in my vision but I don't know how to work it but to think that Jesus Christ died for me and all of the beatings that he went through and you don't even understand we didn't understand those mockings on his body amen was our own markings the Bible even says it was and remember the time when the prophet of God was uh uh accusing and and criticizing the woman she had proper hair and purple nails and purple everything right and he's looking at her and says oh Lord why don't you just you know destroy this thing shatter the fire whatever you need to do see that was the voice of Elijah when you got mad Lord sin down the fire y'all understand me but God said come on behind the door and that's the problem all of us need a behind the door experience it's so easy for us to look at somebody and judge them by their outward appearance Hallelujah you don't know what's in their hearts oh only God knows what was in her heart and she looked like she was a Nokia God but what it was she was a backslidden seed [Music] [Applause] [Music] see we so easily want to give up on God our own people but God never gives up you don't know the background why people do what they do but God knows the bad back the ground but hey he's ready to deliver you from all of your things you've done in the past [Applause] you think he can't be touched by the feelings of your Pharmacy yes he can Hallelujah he's God he made he allowed you to be made that way so on the day of judgment you can stand and says I made it over how did you overcome by the grace of God Hallelujah who who lived in Fame lives and those people out there who's saying it can't be done you are testimony it can be done I was one of them those of us who were alcoholics those of us who were drug addicts those of us amen who were prostitutes we are examples we all witness that Jesus Christ is alive and well [Applause] Hallelujah we are live Hallelujah Hallelujah it's the truth and some of us amen we don't be careful we'll be to leave the silage of the of the science you were born that way um let me tell you something people think that even homosexuality can't be delivered you can be delivered [Applause] Hallelujah I know people amen who stood who's standing today because God delivered them [Applause] don't look at me like I'm crazy he's still God amen that's exactly what the scripture says even in Corinthians and such were some of you yes whether the world knew who you are not it doesn't matter God knows yeah Hallelujah the same Holy Ghost we're talking about it [Music] you know that's the thing about it people say well we're the church and you say well you know everybody look at the church like everybody's so holy and sanctified glory to God that's just that's not true God trying to get them all holy and Sanctified but they ain't all there hallelujah it's the truth y'all love the Lord oh I'm trying to talk to him God's speaking to you and you know what he is right you know he is and you got to listen he ain't here to expose you he's here to deliver you you know when you come up for prayer you don't have to tell me what you want you don't even have to tell uh you need you could stay in your seat and tell him what you want y'all understand what I'm saying but the point is whatever you want God is able you say well I need to say it well I'll say it later but you know God you understand what I'm saying I've seen people that come up and says you know in the church a lot you know we was the closest thing to Catholicism and we were supposed to be the Apostolic Church um oh yeah we would we used to have confession night I saw more lies destroyed like that than ever and you stand up before the bishop and you tell them all your sins but I used to hear people used to they said you know I just want the Lord to forgive me of my known and my own unknown sins you know sin unknown but it's going to be unknown to you right I didn't understand what they were saying but they were protecting themselves because when you got weak Spirits in in the church and you confess something openly and that Spirit hear you you're gonna find yourself with a friend you don't want you hear what I'm saying oh sometimes you people you're about to wake up and smell the coffee some things is between you and God it's the truth so you're gonna feel like oh everybody's as Sanctified as I am and they're going to be honest no they're not you tell some things that you shouldn't tell don't get mad cause they gonna tell it every best friend has a best friend talking to the Lord in prayer that's what you need to do now if you're going out and you committing sin yes you're supposed to do it right but I'm not talking about that I'm talking about even if you're just battling in your spirit about something you better be careful who you tell that unless you got a real Holy Ghost Field sister a brother that you can confide in you better keep it to yourself and talk to Jesus about it y'all looking at me like I'm crazy but I'm talking about victory that's what happens people in the church share things with people then it gets out and then you backslide because they told your story nonsense you shouldn't have never told it [Music] you're gonna fault the person that tells it you the one who started it I don't know why I'm saying these things God knows why I know what I'm doing but I'm telling you about the grace of God God trying to deliver us on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand you understand me well brother you know I'm fighting with this demon [Music] you got to be careful I'm not talking about something I don't know what I'm talking about because I'm gonna tell you something when you offend people sometime it's hard to win back it's so hard and it sets a complex on them so now they're at a place they can't trust nobody and you put them in a prison house you understand me when God is trying to set us free some people can't even you know we used to have testimony Services real testimony service where you can tell what God has done but people ain't spiritual like they used to be help us Jesus you love the Lord amen just give me a few more minutes as I was saying by God's grace we need to be a little more desperate and God's going to give it to you you don't seek God now bring a desperation on you and the prophet God said that's the kind of people we are sometimes we don't even think about God until something tragically happens how sad that is we've got to wait till God push us into a place right and you know the first thing that goes wrong we say oh the devil did it and the devil has been blamed for so many things that he didn't do it's the truth but what God is trying oh I I wish what God is trying to do is get you to empty out to him can you imagine and I don't know the conversation that Mary Mary had with him but whatever she had it was such a secret because Jesus asked her he knew the battles in her heart in her mind he knew that the money she had was for prostitution he didn't [Music] just saw a prostitute but Jesus saw a daughter y'all understand me he didn't stop her he saw her desperation and he allowed her even though he knew that that church service was going to be forever talked about that's just Jesus who claimed himself to be a prophet Mary of all people we know her but how do you know her we know her and he let her touch him now you got to realize in the natural the natural man's eye that looked bad looked real bad knowing what she was and she's not only washing his feet and drying with their hair and crying and slobbering and whatever snotting and everything else she's a prostitute and he claims to be a prophet he ought to know better let me tell you all something when it comes to these people and that's what folks don't understand you think you're going to be defiled because you've seen with the prostitute or if you preach in the gospel if you're giving them the word y'all understand me I brother you may have heard me say this I had a brother one time go into a bar and preached to the body the owner of the bar he preached and the owner of the bar got saved came into this message on his bar you'll understand me see that's what people don't understand wherever he leaves me I will follow that's the way Jesus is he don't care about what the what the what the majority of people say that's probably why we haven't taken a Rapture yet because we're too prideful and God can't lead us into places that you think he would not hmm you know God saved that man and it was just shortly after that he had he was going to his Pastor's house with his Bible in his hand he got to the door and knocked fell dead you tell me God cares y'all understand me you just don't know when that time is and that's why it's always important when God you say well brother Brooks we're in the mat we're in the messaging and we don't have to witness when did he ever change it yeah Hallelujah is that right because after his resurrection after he showed them who they were he said go ye there and tear into Jerusalem until you be endured with power for ye shall be Witnesses of me [Applause] that's where we are he's revealing to us who he is and you and I must know the power is coming Hallelujah and now yes people say oh no yes I'll tell you what brother Brandon said many times amen that before the rapture we will have another outpouring you love the Lord Hallelujah well if you love him you'll be willing to surrender when I'm done not to me to him because just all of this anointing you feeling and the shouting and the that's him but he want to take it further it's not enough to say oh honey I love you you're so sweet you see that's surface love he won't intimacy God help us so what as I said a desperation and this is one of my favorite and we're going to close in just a minute but the thing that gets me is somehow it works I don't know Jesus was a man that whatever God said if I could say it like this he did it there was no hesitation did it and you know I'm saying that we got him inside of us right why do we have to process things don't you know the voice of God you should by now Hallelujah you should know the voice of God a brother said to me he had a pro he had a a special thing um that he requiring he was asking God for something and he said brother books I had the strangest experience he said I Heard a Voice in the voice said I have given this to you he said but it didn't come from my head it came from the inside I'm like that's where it's supposed to come from right you know if it's just going to come to your head you ought to question it but when he speaks from the inside anybody know what I'm talking about well he speaks from the inside you don't have to worry about who it is or what it is you know it's gone only God speaks from this heart Hallelujah the devil might get in my head but God speaks from this heart Hallelujah and I'm gonna tell y'all something so you could understand I'm not here to be uh if I wanted to be famous I could have been if I wanted to be some proud pigeon sitting on something I could have done that I'm saying this for somebody but I surrendered all to God and I'm telling you by God's grace I can't have been a multi-million I had the opportunities but I saw one thing that everybody that had all of this wasn't happy I treasure my joy I treasure my happiness I treasure my peace and and you know what I found all of that in Jesus I'm the only one in my family that believed this message they excommunicated me they still think I'm a fool Hallelujah some of them declared themselves to be Christians excuse me you know I love them but I know the truth and I don't want my living to be in vain but you see there's a lot of Christians who's living is in vain why wasn't that God wasn't faithful but they weren't willing what is this world Goods when you know you're gonna die if the Rapture don't take place you're going to die I don't care if you live to see 200 you're still gonna die Hallelujah and that's what I'm preparing for I'm preparing that if if God should come after I lay down that when I lay down I got my ticket I'm getting up see I'm preparing for the world to come because I know it's there Hallelujah the pains and the sorrows and the turmoils and everything I go through here means nothing y'all understand me the truth of the matter is he's real and the world he's made for me and you is real Hallelujah you said well what do you mean this is why I love this message so much because Paul couldn't talk about it but the prophet of God said I went over there he said whatever you do don't you miss it Hallelujah he said don't miss this Hallelujah people of God think about people who miss the Rapture because they failed to take off high-heeled shoes what a torment you mean to tell me I miss Heaven because of these stupid things that man made [Music] hallelujah it's the truth and you know what people don't understand amen that God said you got to be holy oh high-heeled shoes you you fight that every every preacher every Pastor even in this message fight that and you know what the prophet said but you see they think they're so Justified oh I'm elected yeah you are everybody's elected you know that you were either elected to go to heaven or you're elected elected vessel obana or you're elected to be a vessel Of Dishonor you've been chosen one or the other because God had purposed you is that right but I want to make sure my purpose my purpose is to glorify him oh God help me and we played enough how are we going to keep on playing how many times how many of y'all have ever gotten a whipping for playing when God your mom or your daddy told you to stop and you figure you're gonna give you give you give at least 10 more minutes but you didn't know that your mom or your daddy was coming in silence and they catch you and you can't lie the next thing you know you feel the fire yeah y'all know what I'm saying oh we used to get under the bed my mama said well I know you're gonna have to come out cause you got to use the restroom they know they know you can't stand there forever you run into the into the bathroom you don't know the butter knife is on in the kitchen and they know how to it's worse than it's worse than and I learned also that you stand still when they whipping you right you don't stand still in that belt hit their legs they get one of their own licks you're in trouble y'all know that's the truth they lose control [Laughter] yeah we laughing but it's true you see so you and I must understand if God gonna chasten us chastise us don't get mad with him in all things give thanks the Bible said he chasing Those whom he loved God loves us what you know you don't want to move into this where you won't be able to but God is I'm trying to say this and I don't Lord help us Jesus it's true Lord you know it's true we're moving into a different Channel now and people of God don't miss it because of some carnality don't miss it please because it's happening it may not have happened to you yet but it's happening and I'm telling you right now I know what's going on with me I know there's life in me I know what's going I have battles still but I'm telling you I'm getting more victories Great Adventures now amen and it's not me it's him it's him hallelujah amen yeah yes yes so you and I must understand God gave you listen can I say this and I'm a close you are his victory you are the trophies of his victory amen don't let the devil make you think that you're not bride now that's one thing he don't come to me like that I can't explain it but I know I am he don't come to me like that because once you are convinced well you say how do you know because the Bible says so the word says so I heard the word I acted on the word he called me by the word Hallelujah and the Bible said kiss the son lest he be angry so I done kissed him he don't kiss no anybody only the Bride of Jesus Christ [Music] and when you look at this message and it gets you how many of y'all still get excited when the word of God listen listening to the tape sometimes you know you listen oh you said oh my goodness and sometimes you're just weeping yeah because God is speaking to you right now I want to say to you the Lord has spoken there's a lot could be said and I trust that if I left out anything today that he'll give me Grace to bring it tomorrow because I want everybody to understand amen that we need to you know [Music] um trade in everything give everything up for Jesus you don't know when you're gonna die you could be young you can be old middle age whatever but when that time come it comes sometimes people are sick and it happens but sometimes people just drop dead I know a few people that had just was standing and boom no sickness no nothing the doctor said all I can tell you is that they hard stopped you don't know and you know well I play Russian Roulette you know I don't even understand why everybody in the world don't want to be a Christian I think Christian being a Christian has been the greatest thing that I've ever become I had opportunities you know all kind and for whatever reason God gave me this thing where people like me and I don't understand that either seriously serious I I you know it's the truth even before I got saved people like me and you know what it would be a thing you know I would go you know it wasn't even trying to promote myself or go up the ladder you know and I would it would happen even when I was a sinner I don't know what it is well you know if I had people say well brother books I know you bride I I know you're gonna make the Rapture and I'm thinking wow is that God because somebody something gave them that inspiration to say those things to me and I'm looking at myself like how and I had to understand that it's not my works this is Grace even when I was a little boy those old mamas used to tell me Tell My Mama he gonna be a preacher he got a preacher's head I don't know I don't know what that is but that may you know if this is a preacher's head but my point is I don't even know how they you would know those kind of things I ran from preaching I didn't want to be a preacher I saw what rev was and I didn't want to be what red was you understand me didn't want to be a pastor either I saw the sufferings of a pastor some of my friends were pastors I ran from being a pastor and when they asked me to be a pastor I laughed are you kidding me do you really think I want to be a pastor it took five years for him to get it five years and all of a sudden I'm a pastor like Lord what am I doing here and then I start a Bible study and that Bible study sprung up and there's more people in that church than the one I'm pastoring so I got two churches and I'm like oh God have mercy you know I don't believe in polygamy you know what I'm saying Lord help me so y'all pray for me because what we what what I just I don't want to stop this let me I'll talk about that later some other time but my point is you see how the enemy try to pull me into that there's a there's something more important than that it's you and right now God is here and God want to do something for you but you can't get from God if you're afraid that he is not able so many people don't get what they because you think God is not going to keep his promise God keeps all of his promises like I said when earlier I was on my knees one time and God told me he was going to give me all my children you know what I did I testified and the devil said you should have never testified of that as soon as I did they went and they doing things and have done things and I think to myself oh God there's a miracle in the making yes because that's what it's going to take but is there anything too hard for God Mercy there's nothing too hard for God Hallelujah I don't care what your problems are tonight give it up somebody said well how do you surrender brother Brooks I said this is how you surrender you let it go and you don't pick it back up that's how you surrender like I was saying somebody the other day I said it's like chicken when you give it up you don't care how good is smell you're not going to get another piece y'all understand what I'm saying see y'all some of y'all don't know but whatever your food is that you love so much then you can understand what I'm talking about Hallelujah hey somebody don't understand do you understand why I love fried chicken it was a delicacy when I was coming up you only got Fried Chicken on Sundays and you was hoping your mama did not invite the preacher cause whenever he invite the preacher he ate all the best parts and gave you the next and the backs and I'm telling you he gave it up he didn't realize how good those necks and those backstage you but you got the doctor I know it's I know it sounds funny but I'm telling you it's the truth so God had to I like fried chicken I like it now I don't love it anymore because God delivered me from it because it was it was hurting me and not you know what I'm saying when you start getting up in age all that cholesterol ain't good for you you know what I'm saying so I had to talk it over with Jesus but he delivered not the it's the truth folks it's the truth it fights it used to make me DC I used to my I knew my wife would be cooking um but I had to have a piece I had to go by and get me a piece of Lee's Chicken before I got home and I still had to eat y'all don't catch it that's bad real bad but what I'm trying to tell you that was just fried chicken whatever your problem is was controlling you and getting the best of you and making you be live a lie you need to give it up y'all understand y'all understand what I'm saying I believe the holy spirit is here tonight to give you your Victory if you want the victory you gotta want it it's yours he's already done it but accept it was oh I don't feel it you don't have to feel it let the feeling comes later you'll feel it later when you see you're not craving that thing anymore Hallelujah when you see it doesn't have power over you anymore amen we won't have to worry about you sitting still in your seat Hallelujah I've never been ashamed of the Lord as far as I know of even when I was in the University of South Carolina and that's what I'm saying you can't be ashamed and afraid to testify amen I was I was there and I had done study but you know how they say you have your car to crash because you've been you know dollar Tory you know what I'm saying you you didn't you weren't diligent in your studies and so the night or so before you're you're gonna have that test you have to cram it well that night I crammed it right delayed the test out there Hallelujah it was blank couldn't remember nothing I called on Jesus I called on Jesus God came on the scene and before you know it I was jumping and speaking in tongues right there in the classroom ah it's the truth it's what I'm trying to say is you let go and let God have his way tonight the joy you don't have got to give to you for your brother you brothers who don't know how to cry and you think it's sissified let me tell you something my Lord cried [Applause] my Lord cried there's nothing wrong with crying it's not special when it's about him sometimes your emotions because of traditions and things I had a friend of mine who was a boxer and he had to train himself not to cry and he he couldn't cry I said brother God will give you tears you just keep pressing Hallelujah I remember when he got the Holy Ghost he was almost jumping his heart amen is this desk just in one place it was so Supernatural Hallelujah now when you talk about Jesus here they come Hallelujah you understand me God was able to unlock his emotions to glorify him hallelujah oh I used to be ashamed of my Tears one time I did then I realized there's a lot of people wish they could cry Oh Glory to God you love the Lord Hello Lord Jesus one more thing I just want you to close your eyes right now lock in with Jesus you know the things that's troubling you and you know the things that you want to overcome oh you don't don't go always so hereditary don't even go there because Jesus have a DNA that kicks that kind of thing out and right now I want you to understand that we're speaking and goddess God is speaking don't look at the flesh this man is nothing but the words that has been spoken those words come from heaven is God communicating with you is God talking to you is and it's nothing to be ashamed of all of us are sinners saved by grace not one person in here is perfect within themselves it's it's all God there's not one greater sin one sin greater than the other and we all have come short of the glory of God and think about it there was not one Prophet that could stand and take the book out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne Hallelujah not one not even John himself Hallelujah it took a lamb a bloody lamb to redeem us and you'll redeem tonight those of you who've given your heart to the Lord you've allowed Satan to dupe you and to trick you and to make you think that you can't overcome but you are overcome us you've been predestinated to be Overcomers you are Overcomers that's why you're here in this most evil the wicked and most evil age there is because God ordained you to overcome you are a overcomer what you need to do is accept your overcoming accept what he's done for you accept it in her prayer [Music] God oh mighty [Music] praise [Music] troubled there [Music] enough [Music] oh yes sir [Music] let us stand and raise our hands

if not just some all and you you need to say yes Lord it's me standing in the need of prayer there's no you don't have to be embarrassed about anything [Music] God knows your thoughts are far off

Hallelujah well we're already dismissed we pray to dismissal prayer I thought we would sing one verse one chorus the reason why I went down and grabbed my children is the the enemy there was such a pain brother Brooks I was really in pain going down both sides sciatic nerve down both sides and my legs felt like they didn't belong to me they were so heavy and that came on me as soon as I thought in my mind I'm going to make sure every one of my children get prayed for tonight as soon as I thought that that pain and I could just barely pick him up I wanted to obey the Lord Hallelujah we all have to fight for our children [Music] I've been in churches I've been in places around this Truth where parents come and Drug their children out of a prayer line I've seen it with my own eyes and instead of somebody dragging their child out of a prayer line they ought to be pushing them [Applause] you get all you can and can all you get while the angel of the Lord troubles the water you want to get in and get every bit of it and I had no idea that those legs would be able to move again I thought I'm gonna walk out of here like this but you know what he touched me he touched me Hallelujah and now now I don't want to get out from under the anointing I know what can happen sometime when you get out from under the anointing so we just want to linger but we're pretty weary we were fellowshipping this morning past one o'clock and we Fellowship most of the day today and there's nothing any sweeter oh there's nothing any sweeter but sometimes these bodies have got to lay down and mine's telling me I'm gonna have to lay mine down for a little while and you know you feel the same you're say it again brother that is the truth we used to tell them we used to tell them when they didn't like that kind of carrying on well if you don't like shouting you better not get on the cloud with me because I'm going to listen oh I think we a lot of us started out just offering a sacrifice of praise uh nothing wrong with that the Bible tells us to do that the Bible doesn't say once the Holy Ghost strikes you and you can't control yourself dancing dance before me doesn't say that we like it like that don't we but but he said praise the Lord in the dance and that means sometimes there's just an atmosphere where you just gotta dance and I'll tell you if you'll do it sometime clap a little more whatever it is you can do Pat your foot some of you if you could just get to the place where you could move your toes around in your shoes you might find some freedom in that but you know sometimes when you start putting forth that little bit of extra sacrifice and doing it I'm I'm going to tell you something I love you brothers and sisters my um former Amish brothers and sisters with all my heart and I'm not going to let you out praise the Lord if you can praise him like that I can praise him like that when we when we think of the communities that they came from we think of very reserved you know very reserved worship very reserved and you know what that was right that is right there's a lot of that but when these people get a touch of Salvation and the joy of the Lord they forget all about that that German Reserve you know they forget all about that and they just want to and I'm not going to let them out praise me if they can praise the Lord like that I can too so you brothers and sisters inspired us all you inspired us all Hallelujah [Applause] mighty good preaching mighty good preaching tonight God bless you you're dismissed to go in the name of the Lord you can love one another in here but if you've got a conversation to hold hold it out in the vestibule or out in the front let's come in the morning at 11 o'clock and see what the Lord has see what he'll do for us Hallelujah Hallelujah what a day that will be when my Jesus Jesus I shall see when I look upon his face the one who saved me by his grace then he'll take me by my hand lead me through Promised Land oh what a day what a glorious day that will be one more time today that will be when my Jesus I shall see when I look thank you upon his face the one who saved me by his grace and he'll take me by my hand Lead Me Through The Promised Land what a day glorious day that will be Jesus thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] foreign [Music]
