TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry welcome welcome we're just so happy to have you tuning in to this broadcast for this week and I pray that something will be said that will minister to your needs I also realize and recognize that there are people who would watch this program that perhaps will hear some things concerning the gospel of the Lord Jesus Yeshua that you have never heard before and I want to invite you to consider them to pray about them and if you haven't already I'd like to encourage you to make a decision to follow the Lord Jesus Christ he has paid the price the ultimate price with his own shed blood so that you and I might be redeemed back to our Father great reconciliation has taken place because of Jesus Christ I consider it one of the greatest privileges of my life to be able to come to you week after week on this broadcast and I pray that you who are so faithful to watch will be blessed each time that you tuned in I want you to know that not only can you see the Eagles cry on the satellite network that you're watching right now and some of you are even viewing it on cable because there are some places where the cable companies are pulling down the feed from the satellite wiring it right into your home but I want you to know that you can also get some of the episodes of the Eagles cry on your computer through subscribing to our Eagle cast you can do that by visiting our website revival dot o-r-g and if you visit us at revival dot org there will be a link a button where you can click it will take you to iTunes you can subscribe to our podcast or Eagle cast and you can download the video or audio and when I say that I'll always feel a little funny because the video has audio or you can just download the audio without video so either one you're gonna get the sound but with one you can have the video and the audio and you can view it on your computer sometimes the video file can be a little bit large so you can delete it when you're finished or you can also link it up to your iPod or your mp3 mp4 player and take it with you to work share it with somebody burn the DVD well anyway I may sound like I know what I'm talking about but I don't I'm not very tech savvy but I tell you what what I can say about technology I thank God for where we are right now in technology because I see what a handy tool technology has become electronic technology has become to further the gospel of the kingdom when we first entered the internet ministry on the World Wide Web that was back in 97 so this is 10 years since we have had revival org and the traffic has grown tremendously and the the site has grown and we're still growing and still developing in fact it's a very exciting time at New Hope revival ministries and so if the Lord speaks to you in some way to help support us financially then the address is given the phone number is given and you can do it quite easily through our web page there is a partner and anyone who sends an offering monthly on a monthly basis even if it's five dollars it's considered a partner with us and we use those funds to pay for what we're doing with Christian television and also to try to help our staff we have a very small staff that's overworked and underpaid and who have given their entire lives to to see the work of the Lord go on so we're not about begging for money and I think you know that I think you've noticed that already unless this is your first time watching the program some of you been watching us for a long time now and you know that we hardly even mention it but I do feel in my spirit that these are times of expansion and I do believe that a lot of people doing a little bit can really make a difference in what we are feeling what our vision is to expand and to grow so it's a wonderful thing to know that this little broadcast is not only going out in through satellite television but also over the worldwide web and also there are people who stream our services live from the new hope revival ministries in Alabama you can find out how to do that on our web page so you really need to be in touch with us and I'd like to have an email from you if all it said was I am watching you in such-and-such a place because it's so interesting and encouraging to know that you're on the other end of this camera that you are watching that we're getting out the signal is coming to you and I've told you before we all enjoy it but I have four children two boys and two girls my oldest boy just turned nine years old and my youngest is a girl and she just turned one year old and so the oldest two boys and and and I guess the the third one which is also a girl Olivia she's in an age almost to where she can get excited about it but my boys they get so excited when I tell them about the different nations the different countries that are watching this program we often get out the map or get the globe and we point it out and I I tell you I have to brush up on my geography a little bit to learn just where some of you are living but anyway I just feel so relaxed I just feel like that there is something happening in in this ministry and with the Eagles cry and I feel like God is giving it great anointing and greater impact and I consider that a fruit of your prayers not only the prayers of those who are here but I have had many people who have contacted us to say we are praying we get a lot of prayer support from the UK from across Europe from Scandinavia and that prayer support is what helps us to reach way out into some very unusual and almost desolate places where you wouldn't even hardly imagine that satellite people would have a satellite television receiver but they do and thank God they do thank God they do when we're in Israel and we're often in Jerusalem and we do ministry there we have lots of friends and loved ones there and when we're there we make it a game if my children are with me of counting the satellite dishes on the houses and brother you can get way up there there are many many many people across the land of Israel into the territories etc that have satellite and some of them are watching and have been watching the Eagles crying times past because we've had response well anyway thank you for being a part of what the Lord is doing let's get right into the Word of God today okay last week we were reading and I say a chapter 58 and we only got two verses so I'm gonna read those verses real quickly so we don't so that something doesn't strike me that I want to come in about okay is it such a fast that I have chosen a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him will thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the Lord a question it's not this the fast that I have chosen another question to loose the bands of wickedness amen amen amen to undo the heavy burdens and to let the oppressed go free that you break every yoke that's my prayer for the kingdom of God to expand and to advance and every oppressive burden every depression every oppression of the enemy be broken every yoke of bondage that you wear over your life whatever it is that has you bound hey I've got good news Jesus is the great Emancipator he is the great liberator and he can set you free and he whom the son sets free is what free indeed and that's what we are so desiring and praying for for you in your life verse 7 is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house out to the house when thou seest the naked that thou cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh you see part of being spiritual part of being christ-like part of being a Christian is to help meet the needs of other people I know sometime even in our local ministry we become so focused on reaching the nation's that we forget about the fact and we spread ourselves so thinly financially in trying to reach the nation's that we forget about that there are needs right here in our own community God help us to be more mindful of those who are also around us to clothe the naked to feed the hungry to give to the poor because it's very important that we show the love and the character of Jesus Christ to all people not just those who believe what we believe but those who are in need so let me encourage you as I also feel the conviction of the Lord that we all be very sensitive to needs around us and you know if you can't financially help me to need you can pray I mean seriously intercede and believe God and watch him open the windows of heaven and use other people and other means and other sources to meet that need and you've done just as much when you've prayed sincerely not having anything to give financially but you've prayed sincerely that the need would be met in faith consistently and when the need is met then you have played a vital part of the meeting of that need and God will reward you equally for your faithfulness to him so don't be discouraged if you can't financially meet a need but but do what you can let's have compassion on one another now verse eight says then shall thy light break forth as the morning it sounds like the explosion of morning it sounds like the night is dark and black and bleak and all of a sudden over there on the horizon the Sun begins to peak up over the hill and eventually it becomes like an explosion of light that chases every remnant of the darkness right off the scene amen then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine help shall spring forth speedily perhaps you're sick and afflicted in your body and you could use some speedily health treatments from the Lord you could use some right now healing well I want you to know he's a right now God he's a known time God and he knows what you have need of right now and he is more than able to do exceedingly and abundantly above that which we could even ask or think and I'm believing God right now for light to shine upon your life and for your health healing and restoration to spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee you know we need a revival of righteousness of holiness of purity of living the Word of God moral character right we need for the search for our lifestyle to line up with our vocabulary our conversation sometimes it's Holi but our lifestyle is slack come on now don't leave me don't turn channels now stay with me you know it's right we want to walk you know I mean the most righteous that I can be it's not enough I understand that the most holy that I can be it's not holy enough I understand that that's why we have to surrender to his righteousness that's why we have to plead that that he pour out his holiness and his purity in our life but one of the ways that we become a candidate to receive His righteousness it's by determining to live a life that is disciplined a life that is a sacrificial life a life where we're willing to lay things aside because they hinder our walk with God and they hinder our testimony you know the Bible talks about not letting our good be evil spoken of and and living above reproach my we need a revival of that yes we do but he said thy righteousness shall go before thee help help clearing the way and the glory of the Lord shall be thy rearward not re reward but real word meaning something coming behind you to protect you something coming from the rear to follow you wherever you go I like to say that the glory of the Lord asks my rearward it's not only my protection from behind but it sometimes propels me hit sometimes pushes me have you ever felt like the presence of God was just pushing you to do something because you're too slow to react am I the only person that gets slow and obedient in obedience and obeying the Lord am I the only person that has to have the glory of the Lord come behind me and say get out you know get up and get it over with get it done well some times we need to just do it don't we we need to just get up verse nine then shalt thou call and the Lord shall answer that's the spiritual season that we're walking in we're coming in to that special time now God hears and answers prayers and we know by the scripture that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much but I do believe that there are seasons of heightened spiritual activity I believe that it is important that we carry the anointing to discern the times and the seasons of the Lord and great prophetic voices have been sounding forth around the world warning and telling us declaring to us that we're coming into a season where God is particularly sensitive to the childlike faith to the childlike cries of his people though suddenly swear we've prayed and prayed and interceded and and wrestled with things in the spirit realm holding on and believing God and and waging war until we become weak and then all of a sudden boom boom just a suddenly moment just the the anointing of God the light shines on it your help springs forth speedily your prayer is answered and you say wow I mean it seemed like it was never coming but all when it gets here you know the Bible talks about a woman in travail in childbirth and how how hard it is but in that moment that she is delivered of that child there comes a time when she forgets she really begins to forget the pain in the travail for the joy of being able glory for the joy of being able to hold in her arms that which she has been carrying and many of us right now in this season are spiritually pregnant with a vision and it's costly vision it's something that takes investment and labor both in the natural and in the spiritual a vision or a burden that we've been carrying in the womb of our spirit for some time now with all of health hindrances you know with the enemy doing everything and anything he can to hold us back and to keep us from giving birth to that which the Spirit of God has sown into the womb of our spirit but I believe this is one of those suddenly seasons where we're going to see birth we're going to see the glory for and the reality of what we've been hoping for and praying for and believing for hallelujah somebody ought to be getting excited somebody watching this program all too beginning plugged in about now because it really seems as though we're entering into the new day of the Lord hallelujah the new hour the new season the now release of his spirit and I believe this scripture is intricately tied to this spiritual season although we know it has a natural fulfillment in the nation of Israel but we know that spiritually there is a great sense of heightened spiritual activity angelic visitation the outpouring of signs and wonders and miracles downloads of Revelation heavenly experiences climb the cloud of witnesses people being able to see it over into that other realm or dimension lots of things are happening right now brothers sister if you are stuck somewhere in cold dry formal religion you need to be launched you you need to to get out while you can you need to come into the flow of the Spirit of God Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he changes not and what God's doing for his people today is just like reading the book of Acts and you want to be a part of that you don't want to be a part of lifeless religion you don't want to spend the rest of your life in a funeral you want to be in a revival meeting and that's what God's doing right now absolutely then shalt thou call verse 9 and the Lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say Here I am look for me no more you don't have to turn over any more rocks or look behind any more doors Here I am I want to show myself hallelujah I want to reveal myself to you you call and I will say Here I am can you imagine Lord where are you in the Lord saying Here I am what what a surprise it would be Moses was praying Oh Lord show us thy glory if your glory doesn't come we want to sit right here we don't want to go anywhere without your glory how many of you have ever been in a place like that in your life I have I just rather sit right here dryer die and blow away than to have to make one decision without the leadership of the Lord I'd rather just wither on the vine than to have to make one step without the divine presence and the glory of God and we're coming into a time when I say that we're coming into that's what I mean we're coming into we're stepping into this season right now we're not prophesying dispensation ly 10 years 20 years 50 years a hundred years a thousand years in the future we're prophesying that now is this time now the time has come to arise and shine and let the light of God be manifested in your life right now then shalt thou call and the Lord shall answer thou shalt cry and he shall say Here I am but now there is a prerequisite here in this verse and I'm not gonna skip it it's important it says if thou take away from the midst of the the yoke the bondage the things that hole Jew back and oppress you distract you control you did you know a yoke is a device of control and we don't want to be controlled by anything including religion we want to be controlled or led by only the yoke of the Lord only by the leadership of the Holy Spirit not by man's religion no not by any other kind of bondage or influence but by the leadership of the Lord there's a people oh there's a people coming forth in this hour that are only going to hear from God they're only going to get their marching what now wait a minute I don't mean that we don't have leaders I don't mean that we're not to have the fivefold ministry we must we must have it I'm not talking about that I'm talking about man trying to use his influence and control to dominate and and to take authority and dominion over people to press their will instead of God's will know there are godly men and women who are called up in leadership roles and I know that and I honor them and I respect them and I thank God for them but there's a lot of faults stuff that goes on out there and we're the people of God have fallen victim and prayed to that in the past look out look out because this is a time where we're not going to be so naive anymore no because when we call he's gonna answer when we cry out he's gonna say Here I am and we're gonna be able to go straight to him amen I like that I believe that that's what I'm looking for all right and and he said so if thou take away from the midst of the verse 9 the yoke but putting forth of the finger judging judging being critical being overly religious self-righteous instead of holy there's a difference and speaking vanity foolishness lies lots of things that don't need to come out of our mouth even ridiculous foolishness and so forth I mean it's right in the Bible I'm just reading the book and if now draw out thy soul to the hungry here we go again ministry ministry ministry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity what's he saying if you pour yourself out in the measure of responsibility that God has given you your responsibility and authority will increase if you are faithful to meet needs on the level with which you are where you are now the level where you've been called now the the authority that God has released to you now if you're faithful in that level in that arena of ministry if you'll be faithful there even when it looks small even if it looks ridiculous if you'll be faithful in that arena to that measure to that extent then God says your light will rise in obscurity and by darkness the darkest moment of your life shall be as bright as the noonday it sounds like God has a big juicy fat promise for you and I in this verse of scripture verse 11 and the Lord shall god be continually and satisfy thy soul in drought who when others seem like they're dry and parched and can't get a word can't get connected into the Spirit you're going to not be so you're going to have satisfaction in the season of drought oh praise God and make fat by bones and thou shall be like a watered garden glory and like a spring of water whose waters fail not from obscurity to visibility from darkness to light from hidden places to open places instead of the tail-end the last part of the of the pig to get under the fan God said I'll make you the head and not the tail there's a paradigm shift there's a change that's coming to the body of Christ I need to pray for you right now father we just released the word of the Lord over those who are watching the program the anointing of God is here I've sensed your presence and Lord I just asked for healing and hope and faith to be ignited sin the fire of the Holy Ghost to touch people's lives right now hallelujah sin the Spirit of the Lord to witness in people's hearts that this is the season of transformation and it is the season of the sudden Lee's of the Lord and that we're moving from obscurity to visibility Oh hallelujah I just ask you Lord to bring healing and restoration to your people b'shem adonai yeshua hamashiach in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen well I'm excited I can't wait to give you the next installment of this little series from obscurity to visibility so I hope you'll tune in again next week may the Lord richly bless you press in to the kingdom of God like never before thanks for watching bye bye for now [Music] you
