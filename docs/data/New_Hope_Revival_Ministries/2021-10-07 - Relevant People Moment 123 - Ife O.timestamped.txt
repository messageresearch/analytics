[0:00] you'll have nobody to blame on the
[0:01] reckoning day but yourself
[0:11] but i want you to know that something
[0:12] has happened in this last church age
[0:15] there is a power and an authority that
[0:18] is available to you and i as a believer
[0:21] that's even more potent than it was in
[0:24] the first church age because we are the
[0:27] generation that has to overcome there
[0:30] has to be a people in the last of the
[0:32] last days that go all the way back to
[0:35] the beginning and say this is what we
[0:37] must possess as children of the lord
[0:40] jesus christ
[0:41] we must have the healing virtue among us
[0:44] we must be able to cast out devils in
[0:46] the name of the lord jesus christ we
[0:49] must see miracles and signs and wonders
[0:51] as the bible has promised and no
[0:54] generation has been better positioned to
[0:56] inherit those things than this one
[1:00] because jesus is no longer hiding
[1:02] himself behind the lattice
[1:05] he's no longer clothing himself in any
[1:08] kind of religious expression but he has
[1:10] now stepped out from behind the veil
[1:13] hallelujah and if you want to find where
[1:15] he is he's coming up out of the
[1:17] wilderness that's where he is and guess
[1:19] what i see when i see him i see a little
[1:22] bride walking out of that wilderness
[1:24] with him by the grace of god she smells
[1:28] just like he smells his anointing and
[1:32] his fragrance is upon her who is this
[1:35] that i see coming out of the wilderness
[1:38] hallelujah it's the bride of jesus
[1:41] christ leaning her head on her beloved
[1:45] listening to his heartbeat desiring to
[1:48] do his works
[1:51] hallelujah
[1:53] and all hell is against that truth
[1:57] all hell is against that revelation now
[2:00] you can let somebody keep you back you
[2:03] can let somebody hold you back if you
[2:05] want to but i'm telling you you'll have
[2:07] nobody to blame on the reckoning day but
[2:09] yourself
[2:11] i got my eyes on the prize
[2:13] you may still be under a denominational
[2:15] spirit and you may think the prize is a
[2:18] mansion or a gold street or a pearly
[2:22] gate but i want you to know that's not
[2:24] the goal the goal is jesus christ he's
[2:27] the goal to have him to be found in him
[2:31] that's the goal
[2:33] that's what we're pressing toward we're
[2:35] pressing toward a high calling
[2:38] and that high calling is to be found in
[2:41] the image and the character of the lord
[2:44] jesus christ hallelujah we're not going
[2:47] to walk barefooted we're not going to
[2:49] walk in a robe we're not going to
[2:51] conduct ourselves like they did in
[2:52] second temple period that's not where
[2:54] what we're talking about we're talking
[2:56] about irrelevant people not because they
[2:59] have fashioned themselves after the
[3:02] making of this whole world but because
[3:04] they have held to a truth let me tell
[3:07] you something jesus is more relevant
[3:10] than anything i know
[3:11] he is not outdated or old-fashioned or
[3:15] antiquated he is the same yesterday
[3:18] today and forever he lives and he is
[3:22] just as able to move among us today as
[3:24] he was in the book of acts as he was in
[3:27] the ephesian church age or any of the
[3:29] other church ages
