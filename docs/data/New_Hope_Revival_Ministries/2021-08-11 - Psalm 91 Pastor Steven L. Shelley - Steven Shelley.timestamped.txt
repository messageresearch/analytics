[29:34] and one outside with the window open
[29:38] helping us praising the lord with us
[29:41] and you are joining us
[29:43] across the world really i was looking at
[29:46] some of the of the comments and the
[29:49] amens and
[29:51] even prayer requests that are coming in
[29:53] and
[29:54] some of our own folk at home
[29:56] saying i'm singing you just can't hear
[29:59] me but i'm singing with you i appreciate
[30:01] that tonight
[30:03] you may not believe it but we feel you
[30:05] we feel you
[30:07] and we know your heart is here
[30:10] and we experience the presence of the
[30:13] lord he is
[30:15] with us
[30:16] and like i said if there's only five
[30:19] here that's just barely a handful but he
[30:22] said if two or three would be gathered
[30:24] in his name if we would have opened the
[30:26] doors well there would have been others
[30:28] who would have come but we are in a
[30:32] uh
[30:32] you know just a surge i guess you would
[30:35] say of the coronavirus and our church
[30:38] community
[30:39] and there is very few homes that haven't
[30:42] been touched in some way by it but i
[30:44] just want to give you good news
[30:47] jesus is still on the throne and he's
[30:50] still bringing his people through inch
[30:53] by inch
[30:54] we like leaps and bounds don't we but
[30:57] sometimes it's like millimeters and
[30:59] centimeters but i want you to know he's
[31:02] still bringing his people through
[31:05] we want to go to the lord in prayer we
[31:08] want to lift up your needs
[31:10] we are directing some of our thoughts
[31:12] tonight
[31:14] to our local congregation
[31:16] but we are delighted to have you join us
[31:19] we are streaming live on the new hope
[31:21] revival ministries app on facebook and
[31:24] on youtube
[31:26] and we appreciate your time the fact
[31:28] that you would join with us
[31:31] for a few moments or for the entire
[31:34] service
[31:35] is an encouragement and it's a blessing
[31:37] to us
[31:38] and i don't know about everybody else in
[31:40] this room but i want you to know that i
[31:43] am not discouraged i am encouraged but i
[31:47] am
[31:48] fervent and diligent in prayer
[31:52] and i'm taking it seriously because it's
[31:55] a serious hour that we're living in
[31:58] and there are some of our people who are
[32:00] fighting harder than others
[32:02] who are struggling a bit
[32:04] to keep their oxygen levels up
[32:07] and many are fighting the fever that
[32:10] comes and goes and comes and goes and
[32:13] you know that's our body
[32:15] it's our body responding to uh this
[32:18] viral
[32:19] um trespassing i would say
[32:22] and the body just starts working against
[32:25] that and i'm just so thankful for so
[32:28] many who are testifying that their
[32:31] symptoms are mild to moderate and god is
[32:35] helping them through my heart is
[32:37] burdened tonight for those that are
[32:39] having a harder struggle those who are
[32:42] dealing with a lot of weakness
[32:44] and uh
[32:45] you know the the fatigue the ache
[32:49] that comes with it and some having
[32:52] also some of the respiratory issue that
[32:55] comes with it but i want to report to
[32:57] you that our our first cases the first
[33:01] two cases that we had uh in this surge
[33:05] have gone back to work and so they have
[33:08] come through it they have finished their
[33:10] quarantine and they are back on their
[33:12] job and i want you to know that many are
[33:15] coming along and they're going to follow
[33:17] them i know some are going to be cleared
[33:20] to go back to work on monday and tuesday
[33:22] and wednesday of this coming week and so
[33:25] i want to give god all the glory and i
[33:28] want to tell you that things are well
[33:30] but i also want you to know as a body
[33:33] and we don't mind our friends and
[33:35] families knowing that we would
[33:37] appreciate their prayer
[33:39] we want you to know that there are some
[33:41] who are fighting a little harder than
[33:43] others
[33:44] particularly those who live alone
[33:46] sometime
[33:48] it's so important i'm not going to give
[33:50] you a
[33:51] medical advice or opinion tonight but
[33:53] it's so important to stay hydrated
[33:56] you've got to drink water water water
[33:59] water water it's so important that you
[34:02] do that
[34:03] and i know that a few people that have
[34:05] gone to the
[34:07] emergency clinics that they have they
[34:10] have been told that it's very very
[34:12] important that you stay hydrated that
[34:15] you get rest that you follow some of the
[34:18] protocols that have been shared with you
[34:21] uh
[34:22] taking your vitamins and so forth and if
[34:25] you're on medication you'll be faithful
[34:28] to take that if you're under the advice
[34:30] of a doctor you'll be faithful to do
[34:32] what you're told as long as you feel the
[34:34] witness in your spirit to follow those
[34:36] instructions because we believe that god
[34:39] is bringing his people through
[34:42] and we're claiming that everyone is
[34:44] going to have the victory and so we're
[34:47] not going to be meeting in person this
[34:49] coming sunday or or the following
[34:52] tuesday night one week from tonight but
[34:55] we're just believing that there's going
[34:57] to be so much of a breakthrough between
[35:00] now and the following sunday that we're
[35:04] going to be able to gather again god
[35:06] willing if we have to adjust that we
[35:09] will this is not a matter of pride this
[35:12] is a matter of wanting to be cautious
[35:14] and wanting to be careful
[35:17] and but yet we long to be together and
[35:20] that would put us back together in
[35:22] person on sunday august the 22nd if
[35:25] that's the will of the lord i'm ready
[35:27] for it if he wants us to be stream only
[35:30] for another week i'm ready for that i
[35:33] just want to be in the center of his
[35:34] plan we want to go to the lord in prayer
[35:38] i've already mentioned those who are
[35:40] really needing our prayers weakness
[35:43] i've heard from several today who just
[35:45] say they're just so weak they can hardly
[35:48] uh get up and get around like they need
[35:50] to get around and so we're believing
[35:53] that the strength of the lord is going
[35:55] to overtake them tonight and that a
[35:58] surge of god's healing power is going to
[36:02] move through their body pushing the
[36:05] weakness out and giving them
[36:08] revival strength renewed strength and
[36:12] it's a promise and we can certainly
[36:14] claim that promise we want to pray for
[36:17] uh a few in our church who work in
[36:20] different schools
[36:22] and even bus drivers we have quite a few
[36:25] bus drivers in our church
[36:27] we have some who work in in uh private
[36:31] school christian school public school
[36:34] and uh it's going back to school week
[36:36] and we want to pray for them
[36:39] one sister sent a prayer request just
[36:41] before the service who's starting back
[36:43] to school and she has a whole lot of
[36:46] five-year-olds in her class so we're
[36:48] praying that the lord will give her
[36:50] strength and give her a great school
[36:53] year
[36:54] and his presence be with her and go with
[36:57] her and strengthen her i've already
[36:59] heard today
[37:01] that
[37:02] some of the local kids
[37:04] started school i think in private school
[37:06] on thursday or friday of last week and i
[37:10] know of at least one class that's
[37:12] already turned out because of a coveted
[37:14] case they went two days and now they've
[37:17] been out two days so we just need the
[37:19] lord's
[37:21] perfect plan to unfold so that our kids
[37:24] can get the education that they need and
[37:28] we're a homeschooling church and so we
[37:31] realize that right now it's a little
[37:33] difficult for the mothers to rise up in
[37:36] in a lot of the homes and do the
[37:38] homeschooling that that we would
[37:40] normally be starting this time of year
[37:43] we encourage you not to fret we
[37:45] encourage you to trust the lord and
[37:48] there will be plenty of time and god
[37:49] will give you strength to make up and
[37:52] our kids are going to be fine because
[37:54] they are so blessed i want you to know
[37:57] they are so blessed to have that uh
[38:00] privilege of being trained and taught in
[38:04] their home by their mother by their
[38:06] parents and so we give god glory for
[38:09] making that possible in our nation we're
[38:12] a blessed people so i know that you have
[38:15] needs i saw where sister lasseter is

[52:09] and i'm not going to say one thing that
[52:11] you don't already know
[52:14] i thought there for a while that we
[52:16] would just do part two
[52:18] of the spirit of holiness
[52:20] but i don't want to take that much of
[52:22] your time tonight
[52:23] so i want to go to psalm 91
[52:27] you'll know right away where we're going
[52:29] and here's a brother just texting right

[52:36] god bless our brother i'm so thankful
[52:39] that he has come through it and is
[52:41] feeling 100
[52:43] that is the goodness of the lord psalm
[52:46] 91
[52:47] i want to share just a few little
[52:50] thoughts with you
[52:51] psalm 91
[52:53] beginning in verse 1.
[52:56] so familiar
[52:58] so familiar but sometimes
[53:01] we have a tendency to forget
[53:04] and that reminds me
[53:06] a.w tozer said something well he said a
[53:09] lot of things i like
[53:10] but one of the things that a.w tozer
[53:13] said he said sometimes
[53:16] when we get overwhelmed
[53:18] we forget how big
[53:21] god is
[53:23] have you ever experienced that in your
[53:26] life when you're in the heat of the
[53:28] battle when you're having one of those
[53:31] bad days
[53:32] fighting off the virus
[53:34] you go for hours even a half a day
[53:37] without fever and the fever comes back
[53:40] and you you are just overwhelmed
[53:43] for a few moments
[53:45] the enemy tries to creep in with some
[53:48] thought
[53:49] and really wear you out
[53:52] i think a.w tozer had it right don't you
[53:55] when we get overwhelmed sometimes and
[53:57] that's the work of the enemy that
[53:59] anxiety that will come overwhelming us
[54:03] waiting us down
[54:04] and it's in that moment that we so often
[54:08] forget whose we are
[54:12] i saw recently where someone was posting
[54:15] and they were a little bit put off by
[54:18] something that really blesses me
[54:21] we have brother branham making a
[54:23] statement about the bride knowing who
[54:26] she is
[54:28] and how vital and how important that is
[54:31] but someone was making a statement and
[54:33] they were saying something like well i
[54:35] don't know about that i think it's more
[54:36] important to know who god is well i want
[54:39] you to know that's why god sent us a
[54:41] message of truth
[54:42] that's why we have the holy ghost to
[54:45] reveal to us who jesus is
[54:49] to show us what kind of god we really
[54:54] serve
[54:55] and when we get a revelation of who god
[54:59] is
[55:00] then we can get a revelation of who's
[55:03] we are we belong to that great mighty
[55:07] powerful god
[55:09] and then we begin to get a revelation of
[55:12] who we are because of him
[55:14] and who we are in him and that gives us
[55:19] so many times the ammunition and the
[55:21] weapons that we need to call the devil's
[55:25] bluff
[55:26] and to stand on the word when we are
[55:29] overwhelmed so i encourage you no matter
[55:32] what you're going through right now
[55:35] don't you let the circumstances of your
[55:38] sickness the circumstances of your
[55:40] family problem the the circumstances of
[55:44] the situation on your job so overwhelm
[55:47] you that you forget how big your god is
[55:52] yeah i've i've heard them say
[55:54] uh i don't remember if it was somebody
[55:57] famous who said it or not i've heard it
[55:59] through the years it might have been
[56:01] spurgeon i can't remember but one one
[56:04] person said when the enemy comes to
[56:06] remind you of how big your problem is
[56:10] you just tell the enemy how big your god
[56:14] is
[56:15] and i want you to know something else my
[56:18] god gets the last word
[56:20] his enemy doesn't get the last blow
[56:23] he doesn't get to strike the last punch
[56:26] my god has the last punch
[56:29] my god has the last word he strikes last
[56:33] and it doesn't matter how hopeless it
[56:35] looks
[56:36] you just let mighty god our god let him
[56:39] step in and i'm telling you what he
[56:42] knows how to drive the enemy out and he
[56:45] knows how to silence the enemy sometimes
[56:48] we have to come into a cooperation a
[56:50] cooperative spirit with god and we have
[56:53] to start turning off the voice of the
[56:56] enemy in our in our head
[56:58] we've got to win this greatest battle
[57:01] ever fought
[57:02] now in psalm 91 verse 1 it says he that
[57:06] dwelleth in the secret place
[57:09] of the most high shall abide under the
[57:14] shadow
[57:15] of the almighty he that dwelleth in the
[57:19] secret place of the most high shall
[57:22] abide under the shadow of the almighty
[57:26] now i want to ask you a question this
[57:28] evening where is that secret place
[57:31] is it in quarantine somewhere is it in a
[57:34] storm shelter somewhere is it in a
[57:37] hazmat suit somewhere no
[57:40] that secret place is found in jesus
[57:44] christ
[57:45] when we are in him when we are branches
[57:49] abiding in the vine the lord jesus
[57:52] christ then we discover a secret place a
[57:57] place of refuge a place to hide when the
[58:01] storms of life are passing through we
[58:04] find a refuge in him we find a strong
[58:08] tower in the name of the lord and we as
[58:12] his righteous we run into that tower and
[58:16] we know that we are safe from alarm it
[58:20] doesn't mean that the enemy won't strike
[58:22] it doesn't mean that he will not try
[58:25] to overcome us we know this is part of
[58:28] our living is to is to grow up and learn
[58:32] how to be overcomers in all things i
[58:36] believe one of the most important things
[58:38] that we can yield ourselves to in this
[58:41] last hour is that anointing of the
[58:44] flying eagle that lifts us up above the
[58:48] circumstance the situation the doctor's
[58:51] report the lies of the of the devil the
[58:54] lies of the enemy he lifts us up above
[58:57] that that flying eagle anointing we get
[59:01] a different perspective when we get up
[59:03] above when we come up he's calling us
[59:06] like he called john in revelation
[59:08] chapter 4. there is a door that's open
[59:12] there is a voice that's calling to his
[59:15] bride come up here he wants to talk to
[59:18] us he wants to strengthen us he wants to
[59:21] heal our bodies he wants to give us the
[59:24] victory i believe that with everything
[59:27] that is within me we won't find the
[59:29] secret place
[59:31] in in what the world can provide
[59:34] you know the bad storms the tornadoes
[59:37] the hurricanes
[59:39] they they blow through here
[59:41] and there are storm shelters open
[59:44] and uh churches will open their
[59:46] gymnasiums
[59:47] schools will open their cafeterias
[59:50] and people will go there and take storm
[59:53] shelter and i want you to know that's a
[59:55] good idea for some people who live in a
[59:58] structure maybe that's not as secure as
[1:00:01] one of these commercial buildings but i
[1:00:03] want you to know nobody can tell where
[1:00:06] that storm is going to go nobody can
[1:00:08] predict in what direction it's going to
[1:00:11] blow we know that in this community
[1:00:13] because we lost many lives just a few
[1:00:16] years back with one that came right
[1:00:19] through beauregard alabama but i want
[1:00:21] you to know in the midst of all that
[1:00:23] there is a safety place
[1:00:26] there is a secret place that's found in
[1:00:29] christ i haven't mentioned this in a
[1:00:32] couple years now but there was a video
[1:00:35] of a of an elderly colored woman who
[1:00:38] lives over here in beauregard precious
[1:00:41] woman
[1:00:42] and her home was there with her family
[1:00:45] and i think there were members of the
[1:00:47] family in the community maybe some of
[1:00:48] them even lost
[1:00:50] that tornado come through and blew down
[1:00:53] her house there was one little closet
[1:00:56] standing everything else gone carport
[1:00:58] gone kitchen gone bedroom gone living
[1:01:01] room gone but one little closet was left
[1:01:04] standing and there she sits in a chair
[1:01:07] after everything is blown over
[1:01:09] right beside that little closet that was
[1:01:12] her prayer closet god allowed her to
[1:01:15] find a secret place in him
[1:01:17] and it was symbolized by that little
[1:01:20] closet where she had knelt many times to
[1:01:22] pray and she was a facetiming on the
[1:01:26] telephone a grandson that was somewhere
[1:01:29] else and she's telling him with
[1:01:30] everything that's within her you better
[1:01:32] praise god honey you better thank god
[1:01:35] honey you better give god praise honey
[1:01:38] he's the one that brought us through
[1:01:40] he's the one i want you to know that
[1:01:42] that home could not provide for her the
[1:01:45] safety that she needed
[1:01:47] but there was somebody who could
[1:01:50] there is somebody who can give you the
[1:01:52] secret place he that dwelleth in the
[1:01:55] secret place of the most high and i
[1:01:58] don't believe that's a physical place i
[1:02:00] believe that's a spiritual place where
[1:02:03] we move into a place of trust a place of
[1:02:06] rest a place of knowing that nothing is
[1:02:09] going to happen to me that god is not
[1:02:12] able to see me through according to his
[1:02:15] will i need an amen i need an amen from
[1:02:18] somebody i tell you he's more than
[1:02:21] enough

[1:03:45] standing at guard to protect us and to
[1:03:48] protect our freedoms i thank the lord
[1:03:50] for all of this but i want you to know
[1:03:53] that's not where my real safety comes
[1:03:55] from my real protection comes from a
[1:03:59] higher place if god is on your side if
[1:04:03] you're with him if your trust is in him
[1:04:07] he knows how to bring you through i need
[1:04:09] an amen he knows how to bring us through
[1:04:13] surely
[1:04:14] he shall deliver thee from the snare of
[1:04:17] the fowler
[1:04:18] and from the noisome
[1:04:20] noise some pestilence
[1:04:23] he shall cover thee with his feathers
[1:04:27] and under
[1:04:29] his wings shalt thou trust
[1:04:33] hallelujah his truth
[1:04:35] shall be thy shield and buckler thou
[1:04:39] shall not be afraid for the terror by
[1:04:42] night nor for the arrow that flyeth by
[1:04:46] day nor for the pestilence that walketh
[1:04:49] in darkness nor for the destruction that
[1:04:52] wasted at noonday i want you to go down
[1:04:55] just a little bit
[1:04:57] verse verse 9 because thou has made the
[1:05:00] lord
[1:05:02] which is my refuge even the most high
[1:05:05] thy
[1:05:06] habitation will you make the lord your
[1:05:10] dwelling place
[1:05:11] will you make the lord your habitation
[1:05:15] will you hang out in him and with him
[1:05:19] not just when the storms of life are
[1:05:22] passing through but when things are
[1:05:24] going good
[1:05:25] when everything seems to be clicking
[1:05:28] along just fine
[1:05:29] will you hang out with the lord then
[1:05:32] will you be faithful to his house then
[1:05:35] will you be faithful to his word then
[1:05:38] this is a powerful verse
[1:05:40] he said to us clearly
[1:05:42] only
[1:05:43] because excuse me verse 9 because thou
[1:05:46] hast made the lord which is my refuge
[1:05:49] even the most high thy habitation there
[1:05:52] shall no evil befall thee neither shall
[1:05:54] any plague come nigh thy dwelling you
[1:05:58] say wait a minute brother shelly
[1:06:01] wait a minute
[1:06:03] what about cancer
[1:06:05] what about
[1:06:06] coronavirus what about pneumonia what
[1:06:09] about all these other blood diseases and
[1:06:12] heart diseases aren't they plagues
[1:06:15] something's wrong here this says that
[1:06:18] there will be no plague come nigh my
[1:06:21] dwelling i want you to understand you
[1:06:24] can look at this i don't have time to do
[1:06:26] it with you tonight but i've done it
[1:06:27] multiple times i've looked at this in
[1:06:30] the original language
[1:06:32] and what the psalmist is saying
[1:06:35] is that nothing is going to touch you
[1:06:38] nothing is going to come into your home
[1:06:41] nothing is going to come your way
[1:06:43] that god is not fully completely totally
[1:06:48] aware of
[1:06:49] and not only is he aware of it he's
[1:06:52] already made a way of escape he's
[1:06:54] already made a way of deliverance he's
[1:06:56] already made a way of healing you say
[1:06:58] how is that because he took your your
[1:07:02] the chastisement of your peace the
[1:07:04] chastisement of my peace was upon him
[1:07:07] uh all my iniquity and all my sin he
[1:07:10] took and he took those stripes on his
[1:07:13] precious back hallelujah to cover my sin
[1:07:18] and to heal my body and to give me total
[1:07:21] deliverance of what the enemy would like
[1:07:23] to do to those who call on the name of
[1:07:26] the lord so there's going to be some
[1:07:28] sickness that will come our way there's
[1:07:30] going to be hardship there's going to be
[1:07:32] problems that rise there's going to be
[1:07:34] christian people that suffer with the
[1:07:36] same diseases that people who don't
[1:07:38] trust in the lord but here's one thing
[1:07:40] you can know if it touches you
[1:07:43] god has already known it he has already
[1:07:47] seen it he has even allowed it and if he
[1:07:50] has he has a plan he has a purpose he's
[1:07:55] going to work something glorious in your
[1:07:58] life he's going to speak to your loved
[1:08:01] ones he's going to speak to your
[1:08:03] neighbors he's already got a plan can
[1:08:07] you trust him can you make the lord your
[1:08:10] habitation can you make him your
[1:08:12] dwelling place i know you can i know you
[1:08:15] can and when you get weak and feel like
[1:08:17] you can't let the joy of the lord
[1:08:19] strengthen you let jesus rise up in you
[1:08:22] and do for you what you cannot do for
[1:08:25] yourself there shall no evil befall thee
[1:08:28] neither shall any plague come nigh thy
[1:08:30] dwelling and that means nothing will
[1:08:32] escape his eye nothing will escape his
[1:08:35] hand for he shall give hear hear this
[1:08:38] for he shall give his angels
[1:08:41] charge over thee
[1:08:44] to keep thee
[1:08:45] in all thy
[1:08:48] ways thank you for the promise lord they
[1:08:51] shall bear thee up with their hands
[1:08:54] lest thou dash thy foot against a stone
[1:08:59] this is the grace of god this is the
[1:09:02] keeping power of the lord he is faithful
[1:09:07] in all of his ways
[1:09:10] if we'll dwell
[1:09:12] verse 1 said he that dwelleth
[1:09:14] in the secret place i looked up that
[1:09:16] word dwelleth in the in the lexicon in
[1:09:20] the hebrew lexicon and it says to remain
[1:09:23] to sit
[1:09:24] to abide to have one's abode it means to
[1:09:29] marry
[1:09:30] to marry
[1:09:31] he that will marry himself
[1:09:34] to the most high
[1:09:36] he that will come into the most high and
[1:09:39] make him
[1:09:41] our habitation our place of dwelling
[1:09:44] if we will make him the lord of our life
[1:09:48] he's going to take care of us no matter
[1:09:52] what the enemy
[1:09:53] would rage and threaten against us the
[1:09:57] secret place
[1:09:58] is not a location
[1:10:01] it's not a geographical spot on a map
[1:10:04] the secret place is a person and his
[1:10:07] name is lord jesus christ i don't have
[1:10:11] any means to show you this
[1:10:13] like we normally do when we make a quote
[1:10:16] from the message of brother branham but
[1:10:18] i want to read it to you anyway tonight
[1:10:20] before we before we close
[1:10:22] in a message called spiritual food in
[1:10:25] due season 1965
[1:10:28] paragraph 37 we hear brother branham
[1:10:30] saying now
[1:10:32] but elijah
[1:10:33] during this time
[1:10:35] had a secret place
[1:10:38] that god had ordained for him to go to
[1:10:43] that's the thing we want to see now just
[1:10:45] before we have the prayer line
[1:10:47] elijah had a secret place provided by
[1:10:51] god himself can i just pause a moment
[1:10:54] and tell you my brother sister so to you
[1:10:57] so do i
[1:10:59] elijah's not the only one that god has
[1:11:01] provided a safe place for
[1:11:03] now he goes on to say the church never
[1:11:06] provided it for him the king never
[1:11:08] provided it for him he didn't provide it
[1:11:11] himself
[1:11:12] but god provided a secret place for
[1:11:15] elijah to be fed all the time during the
[1:11:18] drought where his food was provided day
[1:11:22] by day can you thank god for his
[1:11:26] provision can you thank god for making a
[1:11:29] way for you to have what you need he's
[1:11:31] so faithful
[1:11:32] he didn't need to wonder what's going to
[1:11:34] happen tomorrow
[1:11:36] or wonder if the supply would run out no
[1:11:39] sir god said i have commanded the ravens
[1:11:43] they they'll feed you what a wonderful
[1:11:46] thing a type of our secret place in
[1:11:52] christ i want you to know if god
[1:11:54] commanded the ravens to come and provide
[1:11:58] for his prophet he has a secret place
[1:12:03] and a plan for your provision for my
[1:12:06] provision for our healing for our help
[1:12:09] if we'll put our trust in him in the
[1:12:12] same message he goes on to say in
[1:12:14] paragraph 126 and that
[1:12:17] is christ
[1:12:19] that is christ he's the secret place he
[1:12:23] said if you can hide away in that now in
[1:12:26] that secret place you can eat and see
[1:12:30] the goodness and mercy of god if you're
[1:12:34] sick there is healing there
[1:12:38] we we when we look around and see so
[1:12:41] many of our brothers and sisters so many
[1:12:43] of our friends
[1:12:44] fighting with a positive test on this
[1:12:47] virus and yet we can be so thankful
[1:12:50] tonight
[1:12:51] that as of this moment they're not in
[1:12:54] the hospital as of this moment they're
[1:12:56] not on a ventilator as of this moment
[1:12:59] they're fighting daily by the grace of
[1:13:01] god coming through it little by little
[1:13:04] knowing that jesus is the way out he's
[1:13:06] the way out of it he's the way to get
[1:13:09] them through now i believe that the
[1:13:10] bible is clear that there is an
[1:13:13] appointed time man has an appointed day
[1:13:16] on this earth it's almost as though we
[1:13:18] have an expiration date there is a day
[1:13:21] in the mind of god when you and i are
[1:13:23] going to leave this place and and we are
[1:13:26] we're going it's appointed unto man
[1:13:28] wants to die and after death there is a
[1:13:30] judgment for those who do not serve the
[1:13:33] lord but i don't believe the enemy can
[1:13:35] steal your life
[1:13:37] i don't believe he can take your life
[1:13:39] i've heard people say why the devil just
[1:13:42] murdered that man i want you to know if
[1:13:44] that is your theology you are putting
[1:13:47] more power and authority in the enemy of
[1:13:51] god than you are in god god is the one
[1:13:54] who created that lucifer he created that
[1:13:58] one that has become our arch enemy you
[1:14:01] could say he was created and for a
[1:14:03] purpose
[1:14:04] we need not think that god didn't know
[1:14:07] what was going to go on in the enemy's
[1:14:08] life he knew exactly how he was going to
[1:14:10] fail he knew exactly what was going to
[1:14:13] enter his heart and cause the rebellion
[1:14:15] and yet the prophet of god tells us that
[1:14:18] he is no more than a tool in the hand of
[1:14:21] god to perfect the saints of god and i
[1:14:23] believe that with all my heart he's
[1:14:25] going to make a way god is going to make
[1:14:27] a way and he's going to bring us through
[1:14:30] if we put our trust in him so we can
[1:14:33] stand on this word we can stand on this
[1:14:35] promise and you can eat he said you can
[1:14:38] eat and see the goodness and mercy of
[1:14:42] god i'm seeing the mercy of god when i
[1:14:44] get a text from someone who said i
[1:14:47] believe my bad days are over or i get
[1:14:49] i'm 100
[1:14:50] or i'm going back to work i tell you i
[1:14:52] just stop right there and raise my hands
[1:14:55] and say lord that's your mercy that's
[1:14:57] your goodness that's your grace we're
[1:15:00] going to keep on believing keep on
[1:15:02] pressing in i have shared this many
[1:15:04] times through the years but here is a
[1:15:07] little story that i like very much that
[1:15:10] brother branham told i hope it'll be an
[1:15:12] encouragement to some of you maybe there
[1:15:14] may be somebody watching this on social
[1:15:17] media who's never heard this story
[1:15:18] before
[1:15:20] brother branham tells it multiple times
[1:15:23] this is uh
[1:15:24] one sermon in 1964 turn on the light
[1:15:28] that'll give you a little hint what it's
[1:15:30] about i've read it here i think i read
[1:15:32] it last year when some of this stuff was
[1:15:34] just beginning to uh to touch our
[1:15:36] community
[1:15:37] in paragraph 165 he said now it reminds
[1:15:41] me of another little story not going
[1:15:42] back to stories but a friend of mine was
[1:15:45] standing in carlsbad new mexico
[1:15:49] when he was there holding a meeting up
[1:15:50] at carlsbad and there was a bunch of
[1:15:53] people went down into that cave that
[1:15:55] famous cave there in carlsbad the
[1:15:57] caverns in carlsbad he said i never did
[1:16:00] like that stuff down there where it's
[1:16:01] deep and about a mile in the ground he
[1:16:03] said i'm satisfied up here but so they
[1:16:06] went down through i want to go higher
[1:16:08] not lower he said they took this fella
[1:16:11] and went down in there he was a a man a
[1:16:13] friend and his little girl and a little
[1:16:15] boy went down with them
[1:16:17] and they went way down into a big
[1:16:18] basement oh i guess hundreds of feet
[1:16:21] hundreds and hundreds of feet below the
[1:16:22] surface of the earth went down there and
[1:16:25] the man there by the switch all at once
[1:16:28] brother branham was just kind of
[1:16:29] symbolizing that with a sound of
[1:16:31] snapping his finger he'd get them all
[1:16:33] down there and all of a sudden the man
[1:16:35] would flip the switch turn off the
[1:16:37] switch and it was so black and so dark
[1:16:41] until you couldn't even see your hand
[1:16:43] moving in front of your face
[1:16:44] that's dark
[1:16:46] and little girl a little thing was real
[1:16:48] scared and she began to scream out in
[1:16:50] that dark i guess she did to the top of
[1:16:53] her voice oh it's dark it's dark it's
[1:16:56] dark she was screaming hysterically her
[1:16:59] little brother happened to be standing
[1:17:00] nearer and he screamed out into the
[1:17:03] darkness and he said fear not little
[1:17:06] sister there is a man here who can turn
[1:17:10] on the light
[1:17:12] my i like that
[1:17:14] i want to say that to you right now
[1:17:16] fighting the virus fighting the
[1:17:19] oppression of the enemy in your mind
[1:17:21] fighting whatever symptom the enemy has
[1:17:24] tried to uh really
[1:17:27] tie you down with
[1:17:29] there's a man who can turn on the light
[1:17:31] it may be so dark it may feel so
[1:17:35] overwhelming that you couldn't see your
[1:17:37] hand in front of your face but i want
[1:17:39] you to know there's a man that has a
[1:17:41] switch
[1:17:42] and he has power to turn on the light
[1:17:45] that moment of darkness and hopelessness
[1:17:48] and hysterical fear can leave you in an
[1:17:51] instant when the man is there to turn on
[1:17:55] the light he said hallelujah
[1:17:58] what's this little church going to do
[1:18:00] don't worry
[1:18:01] there is a man here today that can turn
[1:18:04] on the light
[1:18:06] he said that's the lord jesus christ oh
[1:18:08] yeah the lord jesus christ
[1:18:11] he goes on to say remember the blind the
[1:18:14] rich man in the days of jesus it was
[1:18:16] wasn't put out and blinded from the
[1:18:17] glare of jerusalem when they got there
[1:18:21] asking about him their theology couldn't
[1:18:23] explain it but when they turned aside

[1:20:23] just read another paragraph here this is
[1:20:26] from uh brother branham telling the same
[1:20:28] story in another message this one was
[1:20:30] called there's a man here that can turn
[1:20:32] on on the light jeffersonville uh
[1:20:35] december of 63 12 29 just uh two little
[1:20:39] paragraphs i think it is he said and
[1:20:41] this little girl standing there she was
[1:20:43] screaming to the top of her voice about
[1:20:45] to go into hysterics about like the
[1:20:48] little bride is
[1:20:50] oh
[1:20:51] he was seeing
[1:20:53] that the pressure of that hour
[1:20:56] was nearly to drive the bride into
[1:20:58] hysterics i want you to know there are
[1:21:01] so many things that are volatile around
[1:21:03] us right now and ever changing right now
[1:21:06] that that any moment it seems like the
[1:21:08] enemy would like to drive
[1:21:11] you into
[1:21:12] hysterics into a fit
[1:21:15] where you would not even be able to
[1:21:17] control your emotion he said this little
[1:21:19] girl was about to go into hysterics
[1:21:21] about like the little bride is but you
[1:21:23] know what her little brother cried out
[1:21:26] little sister don't fear cause he was
[1:21:29] standing right by the engineer
[1:21:31] hallelujah the little boy didn't have to
[1:21:34] be afraid he saw the man turn the switch
[1:21:36] off he was standing right by the
[1:21:38] engineer the one who was running that
[1:21:41] elevator the one who was lifting up and
[1:21:43] raising up that lift and bringing him
[1:21:45] down into that big cavern in carlsbad he
[1:21:48] was standing next to him hallelujah you
[1:21:51] get close to him you get close to the
[1:21:54] engineer you get close to the lord jesus
[1:21:57] christ the closer you get to him the
[1:22:00] more you'll remember he's the one who is
[1:22:02] able to flood the darkness of your life
[1:22:05] with his light he is light he said uh he
[1:22:08] was standing right by the engineer said
[1:22:10] there's a man here who can turn on the
[1:22:12] light don't get scared he said don't pay
[1:22:14] any attention to what they're doing
[1:22:17] you do you walk in darkness you'll walk
[1:22:20] in darkness
[1:22:22] he said be wise
[1:22:23] they that do wise in these last days
[1:22:26] we'll do exploits for god he's talking
[1:22:28] about daniel those who know their god
[1:22:30] they'll walk in the light he said don't
[1:22:32] worry it may be dark may look like
[1:22:34] they're going to force us everyone
[1:22:37] all these you see their proclamation
[1:22:39] going out all these little churches and
[1:22:40] things have got to come in now you've
[1:22:42] got to come in or they're going to close
[1:22:44] you up they're going to make you do this
[1:22:46] they're going to make you do that listen
[1:22:48] brother branham was picking up on what
[1:22:49] the spirit of that age was trying to do
[1:22:51] the same spirit multiplied i don't know
[1:22:54] how many times is after the true church
[1:22:57] of jesus christ in this hour but you do
[1:23:00] not have to be afraid he says
[1:23:03] in the same message
[1:23:04] another paragraph
[1:23:06] this is i think like the second half of
[1:23:09] paragraph 279 he said when the
[1:23:11] persecution comes don't get scared there
[1:23:14] is a light
[1:23:16] said he would catch his people away
[1:23:18] she'll not go through that tribulation
[1:23:20] she'll never do it he said she wouldn't
[1:23:22] do it she'll be caught away no matter
[1:23:24] how dark it gets you can't see your hand
[1:23:26] before you you remember there's a man in
[1:23:28] here who can turn on the light he'll
[1:23:30] rapture that bride he'll carry that
[1:23:31] church out of here i believe that i want
[1:23:34] you to know tonight i'm standing on that
[1:23:37] and i am trusting the lord i am trusting
[1:23:40] the lord that god is going to touch us
[1:23:43] i don't know why i'm doing it but i'm
[1:23:45] going to read one more it's just one
[1:23:47] little paragraph in paragraph 54 of it
[1:23:50] is the rising of the sun i want to share
[1:23:52] this with you he said now and then not
[1:23:54] only that he sent word to his disciples
[1:23:57] his believing he said fear not for i am
[1:23:59] he that was dead and is alive again
[1:24:01] forevermore
[1:24:02] and i have the keys of death and hell
[1:24:04] and i've already conquered it listen at
[1:24:06] what your savior said i've already
[1:24:08] conquered it he said don't fear anymore
[1:24:11] for every foreordained predestinated
[1:24:13] seed of god shall come to life when that
[1:24:16] life
[1:24:18] when that light spreads across the earth
[1:24:21] of the glorious gospel in every age
[1:24:23] it'll bring forth a crop that god
[1:24:25] ordained it to do he has raised from the
[1:24:28] dead i want you to know we have so much
[1:24:31] hope we have so much hope in christ and
[1:24:34] uh i want you to know that fear is of
[1:24:38] the devil and fear brings torment and
[1:24:41] perfect love casteth out fear and you'd
[1:24:44] say well i'm a child of god i don't have
[1:24:46] to deal with fear i i i just wonder
[1:24:49] brother sister maybe you're living a
[1:24:51] higher place than i am maybe you live in
[1:24:53] a higher place than most people i know
[1:24:56] but i what i find out is that most every
[1:24:58] one of god's children has that moment
[1:25:00] that certain situation in their life
[1:25:03] where the enemy tries to bring fear and
[1:25:05] sometimes it's inbred in us sometimes
[1:25:07] it's instilled in us even in our
[1:25:09] childhood we're taught to be fearful of
[1:25:12] things and the enemy oh how he likes to
[1:25:15] anoint that how he likes to exploit that
[1:25:18] in our life but we know that there is a
[1:25:20] remedy i'll tell you the fear of the
[1:25:23] lord is the remedy of fear to fear the
[1:25:25] lord to understand the awe and the
[1:25:28] reverence of god
[1:25:30] is to give you the strength that you
[1:25:31] need to put away
[1:25:33] all the rest of the fear that the enemy
[1:25:36] will try to use to destroy you
[1:25:39] another thing a.w toaster said in
[1:25:41] closing he said fear is of the flesh and
[1:25:44] panic is of the devil i want to say it
[1:25:46] again
[1:25:47] fear is of the flesh and panic is of the
[1:25:50] devil brother shelly are you trying to
[1:25:51] whip us to oh no sir
[1:25:54] you've misunderstood me if that's your
[1:25:56] takeaway
[1:25:57] that is not at all what i came over here
[1:25:59] to do i came here to let you know that
[1:26:03] everything you need is found tonight in
[1:26:05] the lord jesus christ he knows exactly
[1:26:08] what you're going through right now he
[1:26:11] sees the fever he sees the congestion he
[1:26:14] sees the panic that tries to get a hold
[1:26:16] of your life he knows every bit of it
[1:26:18] and he is standing right there and i
[1:26:21] know like like tozer said when we get
[1:26:23] overwhelmed we sometimes forget how big
[1:26:26] our god is i'm going to leave you with
[1:26:29] this before we pray
[1:26:31] another quote that i really like from
[1:26:34] oswald chambers and maybe you've read
[1:26:36] his devotional or read some of the
[1:26:38] things that he wrote so many years ago
[1:26:40] he said the remarkable thing about god
[1:26:44] is that when you fear god
[1:26:47] that's holy fear reverential fear
[1:26:50] reverential fear
[1:26:51] he said when you fear god you fear
[1:26:54] nothing else
[1:26:56] whereas if you do not fear god
[1:26:59] you fear
[1:27:00] everything
[1:27:02] else
[1:27:03] and i have found that to be the truth
[1:27:07] if you are not walking in the fear of
[1:27:10] the lord
[1:27:11] if you're not walking in aw i tell you
[1:27:13] what
[1:27:14] we begin to sing in here tonight all
[1:27:16] five of us
[1:27:18] benjamin's singing and playing the drums
[1:27:21] and the presence of the lord
[1:27:23] just come sweet i don't have to put on a
[1:27:25] praise
[1:27:27] i think sometime brother shelley you're
[1:27:28] just pushing you just carry on because
[1:27:31] you're trying to get somebody else
[1:27:32] whooped up i want you to know that is
[1:27:35] incorrect
[1:27:36] i don't have to be whooped up
[1:27:39] i don't have to be told to praise the
[1:27:41] lord nobody has to tell me to raise my
[1:27:44] hands and be loud the bible said praise
[1:27:46] him in a loud aloud with loud sounding
[1:27:49] symbol
[1:27:50] lift up your voice and cry loud to the
[1:27:52] lord nobody has to tell me that
[1:27:55] i tell you when i begin to think of the
[1:27:58] goodness of the lord we began to sing
[1:28:00] those beautiful songs tonight and it
[1:28:03] gives me so much peace i pray that it
[1:28:05] brought peace to your home i pray that
[1:28:08] it'll bring peace to your situation
[1:28:10] right now i want you to know that god is
[1:28:13] aware he
[1:28:15] is aware
[1:28:17] i'm seeing so many uh who are reaching
[1:28:20] out right now to encour to be
[1:28:22] encouraging and to ask for prayer may
[1:28:25] god bless every one of you i can't it
[1:28:28] won't hardly let me to go through and
[1:28:30] see everyone and call your name out but
[1:28:32] i will say this right now when we pray
[1:28:35] we're praying for you when we lift up
[1:28:37] the name the names of this congregation
[1:28:40] we're going to pray over your over you
[1:28:42] and your need in your life and we're
[1:28:44] going to say lord everyone who is
[1:28:46] streaming that service you see their
[1:28:48] need
[1:28:49] this is a battle we need each other
[1:28:52] we need each other
[1:28:53] if darkness should try to overwhelm you
[1:28:56] tonight
[1:28:57] you wake up in the night with a little
[1:29:00] fear creeping in
[1:29:02] it came to me once
[1:29:04] when i was fighting
[1:29:06] the virus in october
[1:29:08] we didn't do like some people do there
[1:29:10] they were on social media and they were
[1:29:12] giving reports about how they felt and i
[1:29:14] didn't do do that no we just tried to
[1:29:16] keep it
[1:29:17] among the saints here and we knew people
[1:29:19] were praying and there were some others
[1:29:21] who were suffering
[1:29:23] and
[1:29:24] we just tried to take it to the lord
[1:29:27] and i felt good for several days and
[1:29:29] then that one day
[1:29:30] that pressure began to come across my
[1:29:32] chest and i began to feel like something
[1:29:34] was sitting on top of my chest and for
[1:29:37] just a moment
[1:29:38] i'm just a human like you for just a
[1:29:40] moment of fear came over me
[1:29:42] and that i was going to smother i hate
[1:29:45] to say it like that but that's how it
[1:29:46] came and i want you to know
[1:29:49] i had i had to in fact friends pastor
[1:29:54] friends
[1:29:55] said to me if that
[1:29:57] little
[1:29:58] thing that you're feeling in your lungs
[1:29:59] if it's not better in the morning you
[1:30:01] promise me in fact one said you tell me
[1:30:03] right now you're going straight now to
[1:30:04] have an x-ray you should go right now
[1:30:07] you should go right now and i think
[1:30:09] maybe
[1:30:10] i might have already done such a thing
[1:30:12] as that but before i could
[1:30:15] that fear that tried to grip me i began
[1:30:17] to call on the lord i began to sing
[1:30:19] praises to god i began to think of the
[1:30:22] goodness of jesus and all that he has
[1:30:24] done in my life i want you to know he's
[1:30:26] been so good to me
[1:30:28] he has been so good to me and he began
[1:30:31] to lift that fear he began to push that
[1:30:33] fear away
[1:30:34] and i began to do every remedy and
[1:30:37] and the fried onions on my chest and
[1:30:39] everything else i don't want to say
[1:30:41] these things
[1:30:42] really out i don't want to give medical
[1:30:44] advice on here but oh how he delivered
[1:30:47] me

[1:30:49] that some of you are suffering worse
[1:30:51] than i was some of you are dealing with
[1:30:54] it and
[1:30:55] and it's really really taking a toll i
