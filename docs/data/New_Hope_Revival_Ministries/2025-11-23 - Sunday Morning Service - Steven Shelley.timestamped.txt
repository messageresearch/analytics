[37:03] I worship you, Lord.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; I praise you because
[37:09] &gt;&gt; you press through all of my stuff
[37:13] &gt;&gt; to find me to get me.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; When I didn't have enough sense to
[37:19] press, Lord, you pressed
[37:22] &gt;&gt; when I was wallering too deeply in my
[37:24] sin and shame. You found me.
[37:28] &gt;&gt; And I thank you for your never ending
[37:31] love.
[37:34] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Praise your name, Lord.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful that he was seeking for me.
[37:51] &gt;&gt; Though I knew him not,
[37:54] &gt;&gt; still he loved me
[37:56] &gt;&gt; and he was seeking for me.
[38:00] Because he was seeking for me,
[38:03] &gt;&gt; my heart was turned to him.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Do you have a need on your
[38:09] heart today as we go into prayer?
[38:14] Hands are raised. The Lord sees the
[38:16] needs. Want to pray for those that are
[38:19] traveling in, those who will be
[38:21] traveling out. We want to remember
[38:25] Michael and Crystalin's daughters today,
[38:27] Adelaide and Lydia. They're not well. We
[38:29] want to ask the Lord to minister to
[38:31] them. Remember my granddaughter Edith.
[38:33] She needs a touch from the Lord.
[38:36] Some some of the Yoviches are are not
[38:38] well and need to be remembered to the
[38:40] Lord. And Haj's children are not well.
[38:45] They're coughing and they need to be
[38:46] remembered to the Lord. And sometimes
[38:49] people just are staying home to keep
[38:51] keep things from spreading because they
[38:54] just go so quickly among us. My dear
[38:57] friend, Brother Paul Drowned is facing a
[39:01] a crisis of health and needs to be
[39:04] remembered to the Lord in prayer.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; And for those of you that have not
[39:08] heard, Sister Flo lost her granddaughter
[39:11] Brandy Michelle last night. She had uh
[39:15] fought for quite a while, many years now
[39:18] with her health and uh even uh cancerree
[39:23] and and and whipped so many things. but
[39:27] uh had a little procedure done on on
[39:30] Friday and it didn't go so well. They
[39:34] weren't able to do what they needed to
[39:35] do and something happened. I don't know
[39:37] what it was, but she ended up being uh
[39:41] having sepsis and and they went in for
[39:44] surgery to try to correct the problem
[39:46] and lost her.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; And we want to remember the whole family
[39:50] to the Lord in prayer. all of them. Uh
[39:53] the the siblings uh you know technically
[39:57] we we could say half siblings but people
[40:00] don't
[40:01] close families don't pay no attention to
[40:03] half and step and all of that and I know
[40:06] their hearts are are hurting the whole
[40:09] family. Sister Flo again has lost a
[40:12] loved one.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; God has been so faithful to her.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah. and they don't know how maybe they
[40:19] don't even know how blessed they've been
[40:21] &gt;&gt; right
[40:22] &gt;&gt; to have her praying them over safely
[40:25] when I heard I had a great peace
[40:28] that somehow Brandy had made all
[40:30] preparation
[40:32] &gt;&gt; and then I heard later that that she had
[40:34] a [music] you know some intuition some
[40:37] feeling that maybe this would be it this
[40:40] might be the one she didn't come through
[40:42] which sort of confirmed for me that
[40:46] when you're fighting like that, you
[40:48] better stay prayed up and you better
[40:49] better know that you're ready to meet
[40:51] the Lord. And and I believe she I
[40:53] believe we'll see her
[40:54] &gt;&gt; and I believe Sister Flo will see her on
[40:57] the other side of the river. But uh
[40:59] please pray for that family this week.
[41:02] And uh brother Daniel and Sister Anna
[41:04] are leaving after the service today to
[41:07] drive uh for quite a drive to get home
[41:11] to her parents for her uh uncle's
[41:14] funeral. longtime pastor of a little
[41:18] message church there and we'll be seeing
[41:20] family. Let's pray for their safety. And
[41:22] my family's all all but Joshua. He has
[41:25] to work. We're going to we're driving
[41:27] away for three nights. Uh leaving this
[41:29] afternoon as well. We want safety and
[41:31] and uh then your family starts coming in
[41:35] soon. When when do the first ones come?
[41:37] Do you know?
[41:38] &gt;&gt; Start coming in Wednesday, he said. So,
[41:41] let's uh really lift them up to the Lord
[41:43] that everyone will will travel safely
[41:45] and wherever you're going, we're going
[41:47] to have some missing next weekend. May
[41:49] God just be with you. Angels lining the
[41:52] highways. It's a dangerous time. It
[41:54] really is.
[41:56] &gt;&gt; And I I feel sometime burdens to pray
[41:58] for people who are moving about. Uh
[42:01] we're all targets.
[42:02] &gt;&gt; We are.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; But thanks be to God, we're not going
[42:05] anywhere.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Until he's ready for us.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't care how bad the doctor
[42:11] is. I don't care how bad the hospital
[42:13] is. I don't care how bad the surgery is.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; We're not going anywhere until the Lord
[42:19] is ready for us.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; He says it's done.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; I know some people say they believe in
[42:23] the sovereignty of God, but they talk
[42:24] like they don't. I believe it
[42:26] &gt;&gt; right.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; I believe he's sovereign.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Right.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; I've seen miracle. God can give a
[42:30] miracle.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[42:32] &gt;&gt; If you got a bad doctor, God can get
[42:34] involved and do and and do it himself.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Anyway, let's believe the Lord. Amen.
[42:39] &gt;&gt; Rest of this service.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:42] Oh Lord, I love you.
[42:47] Yes, I love you. I love you more today
[42:56] because
[42:58] you care for me [singing]
[43:02] in such a special way. That's why I
[43:08] praise you and I lift you up and I
[43:14] magnify
[43:17] your name.
[43:21] That's why my heart just wants to
[43:26] praise.
[43:29] Oh Lord, I love you.
[43:34] Yes, I love you. I love you more today
[43:43] because
[43:44] you care for me
[43:48] in such a special way. That's why I
[43:55] praise you
[43:57] and I lift you up and I magnify
[44:04] your name.
[44:08] That's why my heart just wants Brother
[44:12] R.J. can I call on you to pray today,
[44:15] please?
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, I love you.
[44:21] Yes, I love you. I love you more today
[44:30] because
[44:32] you care for me
[44:36] in such a special way. That's why I
[44:43] praise you
[44:45] and I lift you up and I magnify
[44:52] your name.
[44:56] That's why my heart just wants to pray.
[45:03] Beautiful song. Praise the Lord.
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[45:08] Lord, we do worship you today.
[45:14] How thankful we are, Father,
[45:18] for your goodness and your faithfulness.
[45:22] We're the apple of your eye, Lord.
[45:26] There's not a thing that can happen on
[45:29] this earth or to your people, to your
[45:32] bride, that you're not intimately aware
[45:34] of.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe it. And I thank you, oh
[45:38] God, that you are a high priest that's
[45:42] touched with the feelings of our
[45:43] infirmities
[45:45] because you walked in flesh among us.
[45:48] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; I was thinking earlier today, Lord,
[45:53] we're a diverse people, but we're
[45:57] unified and that we all share the same
[46:00] lamb. Amen.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Every one of us today,
[46:06] &gt;&gt; our claim is Yeshua, the lamb of God,
[46:10] slain from the foundation of the world.
[46:16] &gt;&gt; And so, we're a blessed people, Father.
[46:20] &gt;&gt; We're blessed that you've opened our
[46:21] eyes
[46:23] &gt;&gt; to see and to receive your sonus.
[46:31] Lord, I pray for your people today.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; The enemy likes to lie.
[46:39] He does.
[46:41] &gt;&gt; Every every sickness and every illness
[46:45] &gt;&gt; is just a lie.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:48] &gt;&gt; Because you bore in your body stripes
[46:51] &gt;&gt; on our behalf.
[46:53] Willingly, oh God, you submitted
[46:55] yourself not to the hand of Rome, but to
[46:59] the hand of your father because it
[47:01] pleased him to bruise him.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Because by his stripes, we are healed.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; And today, Lord, we appropriate that
[47:13] covenant.
[47:14] We speak over every body today to come
[47:18] into alignment, Lord, with your will and
[47:21] with your word in the name of Yeshua,
[47:23] the Messiah. Lord, I ask that you would
[47:26] release faith upon your people today,
[47:29] Lord, that they would apprehend your
[47:32] promises, Lord, that you purchased with
[47:35] your blood.
[47:37] Let us reject every lie, oh God, and let
[47:41] us hold fast our confession of faith,
[47:46] &gt;&gt; and praise you, oh God,
[47:49] &gt;&gt; and praise you until that miracle bursts
[47:52] forth in this realm because it's already
[47:56] true,
[47:58] &gt;&gt; accomplished in that realm
[48:01] &gt;&gt; and we pull it forth today. Oh God, we
[48:04] pray for pastor for your healing hand.
[48:08] We just confess wholeness over him in
[48:11] the name of Yeshua the Messiah.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Lord, for wisdom for your people in
[48:17] every decision. We thank you for
[48:19] leadership. We thank you for clarity, oh
[48:22] God. I ask that you would move by your
[48:25] spirit. Move away, Lord, every
[48:28] distraction,
[48:29] Lord, every cloud of darkness. and let
[48:32] clarity come and strike the hearts of
[48:35] your people,
[48:37] &gt;&gt; Lord. And in this season of
[48:38] thanksgiving,
[48:41] &gt;&gt; may we each remember
[48:43] what it cost you
[48:46] to come
[48:49] &gt;&gt; and how thankful we are, oh God.
[48:53] I pray for this service today, Lord,
[48:55] that it will be another installment of
[48:58] your purposes.
[48:59] I ask that each of us would have ears to
[49:02] hear, that our hearts would be receptive
[49:05] to your word, and that you would bring
[49:07] forth fruit in our lives, oh God.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; We just commit this service, this day to
[49:13] you. And we pray above all that you
[49:16] would be glorified, Lord, that you would
[49:18] be praised and that you would be pleased
[49:21] with your people today. We worship you,
[49:24] oh God, in the name of Yeshua, the
[49:26] Messiah. [snorts] Amen.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:29] Amen.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Praise your name, Lord.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Glory to the Lamb.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats today.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; He is good. He is faithful.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; Sister Sharon sent a testimony today.
[49:59] of this child that we've been praying
[50:01] for. It's been on the app, this baby
[50:03] Cohen that had gotten some bad formula
[50:06] and botulism. But anyhow, the the MRI or
[50:13] the MRA shows that the strokes he had
[50:16] are healing and the brain is resolving
[50:19] them.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; He should make a full recovery from
[50:23] them.
[50:25] No signs of vasculitis either. All good
[50:28] news.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; The bad news is the swallow study sh
[50:32] still shows some aspirating in the
[50:34] lungs. So they're worried about that.
[50:36] But uh they're putting in a feeding tube
[50:39] so they can do part of the feeding by
[50:40] mouth and part with this NG tube. So
[50:44] it's going to progress more slowly. But
[50:46] we're giving thanks to God for what he
[50:48] has done for this child.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[50:53] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[50:57] &gt;&gt; God is so good. He's so good.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; Sister Hannah, it's good to see you and
[51:02] Natalie and the children. They're the
[51:04] the babies. We're glad that they're here
[51:07] today.
[51:10] [applause]
[51:11] They've come home for a few days, then
[51:14] they got to go back to Arkansas.
[51:16] So, we're glad that you're here. Solomon
[51:18] and Zion, we're glad to see you. The
[51:20] Lord bless you. We're glad that you're
[51:22] here today.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[51:27] &gt;&gt; All of you home folk, we're sure glad to
[51:29] see you today. Glad that the Lord has
[51:31] kept you and strengthened you and helped
[51:33] you through the week. He's given you the
[51:36] grace you need for each day. He promised
[51:39] that he would give us daily bread. And
[51:41] it's not just the food in our mouth, but
[51:43] he gives us daily grace. when it looks
[51:47] overwhelming, he he somehow lets his
[51:50] mercy be renewed every morning. And so
[51:53] thankful for that. Brother Daniel, you
[51:55] have a song today. We're going to invite
[51:57] you to come while they're getting ready.
[51:59] We want to thank you for your giving. We
[52:02] appreciate the Lord that he has uh made
[52:06] way for you, for your family, and you
[52:09] have kept covenant with him in the
[52:11] giving of your tithe and offering. We're
[52:13] thankful that we have the opportunity to
[52:16] give to the Lord because everything that
[52:18] we have is because of him. And because
[52:22] that he gave it to us, we want to keep
[52:25] that covenant with him in the giving of
[52:27] our tithe and then adding to it an
[52:30] offering
[52:31] &gt;&gt; as he has blessed us. Brother Jesse, I'm
[52:33] going to call on you today. And brother
[52:35] Ellias, let these brothers come to you
[52:37] for the tithe and offering and we're
[52:38] going to give unto the Lord as he has
[52:40] blessed us.
[52:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:51] Thanks
[52:53] for loving me.
[52:54] &gt;&gt; For loving me.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; For you have set
[52:58] &gt;&gt; my spirit free,
[53:01] Lord. I'm not one
[53:03] I used to be.
[53:06] Oh, [music] I said thank you, Lord, for
[53:09] loving me.
[53:12] My empty heart was heavy and no one
[53:16] seemed to care. My life was full of
[53:19] misery that no one else could share. My
[53:24] was in prison. I couldn't find a key
[53:27] until you open up [music] my life by
[53:30] loving [singing] me.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Thanks."
[53:34] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Thanks,
[53:36] &gt;&gt; love me. [singing]
[53:37] &gt;&gt; I need you. I have used
[53:40] &gt;&gt; my spirit free. [music]
[53:42] &gt;&gt; My spirit free.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm not one.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; I'm not one.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; I used to be.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; I used to be.
[53:50] Thank you, Lord, for loving me.
[53:53] [singing and music]
[53:55] &gt;&gt; I know you kept on loving when all I
[53:58] was.
[54:00] You kept [music] right on blessing me
[54:02] when I did not deserve. You've been the
[54:06] dearest friend that anyone [singing]
[54:09] could be. [music] So I say thank you
[54:12] Lord for loving me.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; And I [music] said thank you.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; I said thank
[54:18] &gt;&gt; for loving me.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; for loving [singing] me.
[54:20] &gt;&gt; For you [music] have set
[54:23] my spirit free.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; My spirit free.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; But [music] I'm not one.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; I'm not one.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; I used to be.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; I used to be. [music] I said, "Thank
[54:33] [singing] you, Lord, for loving me."
[54:37] &gt;&gt; I know you kept on loving [singing]
[54:40] when I was [music] returned. And you
[54:43] kept right on blessing me when I did not
[54:46] [singing] deserve. You've been [music]
[54:48] the dearest friend that anyone could be.
[54:53] I said, "Thank you, Lord, [music] for
[54:56] loving me."
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Well, I said, "Thank
[55:01] for loving me.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; For loving me,
[55:03] &gt;&gt; for you have set
[55:06] my spirit [music] free,
[55:08] Lord, I'm [singing] not one.
[55:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm not one.
[55:11] &gt;&gt; I used to be.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; I used to be.
[55:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, I said thank you, Lord. [music] You
[55:17] want to try with us one time?
[55:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, I said thanks
[55:22] for loving me.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; For loving me.
[55:25] &gt;&gt; For you have set
[55:28] [music] my spirit free. I see.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; Lord, I'm not what [singing]
[55:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not what
[55:33] &gt;&gt; I used to be. [music]
[55:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, I said thank you Lord [singing] for
[55:39] loving me.
[55:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, I said thank you Lord [singing] for
[55:44] loving me.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Sure is.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Thank you, brother
[55:59] Daniel and Sister Anna.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; I'm glad the Lord keeps on loving me.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; He doesn't fall out of love with me.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; And I remember something that Brother
[56:13] Perry Green used to say. He can't love
[56:16] me any more than he already did or does,
[56:19] but I can love him more.
[56:23] &gt;&gt; He keeps on loving me constant all the
[56:26] time. And because that he does, it
[56:29] causes me to want to love him more.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Would you stand with us today as we're
[56:38] getting ready to go to the word?
[56:52] Well, I started out traveling for the
[56:55] Lord many years ago.
[56:57] [singing]
[56:59] I've had a lot of heartache, had a lot
[57:02] of grief and woe. [singing]
[57:06] But when I would stumble, then it would
[57:09] down.
[57:12] And there I would say I wouldn't take
[57:14] [music] nothing for my journey now.
[57:18] Oh, I wouldn't take [music] nothing for
[57:21] my journey now. Got to make it to heaven
[57:25] somehow. Though the devil [music] tempts
[57:27] me and he tries turn me around.
[57:33] He's offered everything that's got a
[57:35] name. All the wealth I want and worldly
[57:39] fame if I could. Still, [music] I
[57:41] wouldn't take nothing for my journey.
[57:43] Now
[57:45] [singing]
[57:47] there's nothing in the [music] world
[57:48] that will ever take the place of God's
[57:50] love. [singing]
[57:53] [music]
[57:54] Silver and gold could never buy his
[57:56] touch from above.
[58:00] [screaming]
[58:00] When my soul needs healing, I began to
[58:04] feel his power.
[58:08] I could say thank you, Lord. I wouldn't
[58:10] take [music] nothing for my journey now.
[58:12] Sing it out.
[58:15] I wouldn't take nothing for my journey
[58:17] now. I got to make it to heaven somehow.
[58:21] [music]
[58:22] Though the devil tempts me and he tries
[58:25] turn me around.
[58:29] He's offered [music] everything that's
[58:31] got a name. All the wealth I want and
[58:35] worthy fame. If I could still would take
[58:38] nothing for my journey. Sing the course
[58:41] again. Yeah. Wo. I wouldn't take nothing
[58:45] [music] for my journey now. I got to
[58:48] make it to heaven somehow. [music]
[58:51] Though the devil tempts me and he tries
[58:53] to turn me around.
[58:58] He's offered [music] everything that's
[59:00] got a name. All the wealth I want in
[59:04] worldly faith. If I could [music] still
[59:06] wouldn't take nothing for my journey
[59:09] now. I wouldn't.
[59:12] Amen.
[59:13] Give the Lord a praise.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't.
[59:23] You may be seated.
[59:25] I wouldn't take nothing for my journey.
[59:28] Now,
[59:30] &gt;&gt; I know that there are Yankees that were
[59:32] born north of the Mason Dixon line who
[59:36] may not know what that song means.
[59:39] Because in your refined English, you
[59:43] probably think, "I wouldn't take nothing
[59:45] for it." Means it's not much value.
[59:51] I wouldn't take nothing for it. But
[59:53] that's not what it means in the South.
[59:56] In the south, it means it's so valuable.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; That you could not purchase it.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't take nothing for it.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; How many of you wouldn't take I I
[1:00:09] wouldn't take anything.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; I wouldn't trade anything
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; for this journey.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; Are there parts I would erase? Yes.
[1:00:18] &gt;&gt; Are there parts I might would delete?
[1:00:20] Yes.
[1:00:21] &gt;&gt; But God said they've got to be there,
[1:00:23] too. Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; The ups, the downs, the highs, the lows,
[1:00:27] the ins, the outs.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Isn't he good?
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; Well, you've been quiet a little bit
[1:00:32] this morning, but we we're just going to
[1:00:34] believe you're you're uh contemplating
[1:00:37] uh a a good week of giving God thanks.
[1:00:40] And
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; I hope you weren't sitting there
[1:00:42] thinking about what kind of pie you're
[1:00:45] going to get because you'll need a sli
[1:00:48] half a slice half a slice of all of it.
[1:00:52] I'll just settle it for you. We had
[1:00:55] dinner with brother and sister Miller.
[1:00:56] Truman and uh brother Truman and Sister
[1:00:58] Martha Miller in their home. They've
[1:01:01] lived there over a year and have invited
[1:01:05] us. And every time we had planned to go,
[1:01:07] we got sick. One of the kids was sick,
[1:01:09] somebody was sick, and we didn't want to
[1:01:11] spread it. So, we didn't get to go. But
[1:01:13] we went this week and they had two kinds
[1:01:16] of pie. And my wife ought to know
[1:01:19] better, but she said, "What kind do you
[1:01:21] want? I want pie."
[1:01:24] That means a half a slice of both of
[1:01:26] them. And well, I think they were a
[1:01:28] little bigger than a half. But brother
[1:01:30] Truman, he showed me you really can get
[1:01:32] by with a half. He come back and his
[1:01:34] were two half pieces. If you slid them
[1:01:36] together, they would make a hole. God is
[1:01:39] good.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; He is good.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; He provides, doesn't he? I want to sing
[1:01:43] a song. We've had good singing already.
[1:01:46] You don't need mine, but I want to sing
[1:01:49] this song.
[1:01:51] It's called One More Valley. And I don't
[1:01:53] know if it's uh G or B flat or F or A
[1:01:58] flat or E flat or C or D minor. No
[1:02:02] minors any
[1:02:04] when I'm tossed. Will that work? No,
[1:02:09] that won't work.
[1:02:14] When I'm tossed on life sea
[1:02:18] and the waves [singing] cover me and the
[1:02:23] dark clouds won't let the sun shine
[1:02:27] through.
[1:02:30] There's a voice that seems to say,
[1:02:33] "Child, there'll be a brighter day.
[1:02:38] Don't allow [music] the storm to hide
[1:02:41] sweet heaven's view. Cuz
[1:02:45] you've got one more valley, [music] one
[1:02:50] more hill.
[1:02:52] Woo!
[1:02:53] Maybe one
[1:02:56] more trial, one more tear.
[1:03:00] Praise God. One more curve in life's
[1:03:04] road. Maybe one more mile to go. And you
[1:03:10] can lay down your heavy load when you
[1:03:14] get home. [music]
[1:03:15] It's kind of simple, but don't let Satan
[1:03:19] see your tears. [music]
[1:03:21] Try to learn to smile through all your
[1:03:24] fears. Hold your head up high. Give this
[1:03:29] world a smile.
[1:03:32] [music] Try to be faithful all the way.
[1:03:37] It will be worth it all someday for it's
[1:03:42] all going to be over after a while. Let
[1:03:47] me hear you sing. Oh, you've got one
[1:03:51] more valley, one more hill.
[1:03:56] You've got one more trial, one more
[1:04:01] tear.
[1:04:04] Oh, one more curve in life's road. Maybe
[1:04:09] one more mile to go. You [music] can lay
[1:04:13] down your heavy load when you get home.
[1:04:19] Don't let [music] Satan see your tears.
[1:04:24] Learn to smile through all your fears.
[1:04:28] Hold [singing] your head up high.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Give this whole world a smile.
[1:04:36] Try to be faithful [singing] all the
[1:04:38] way. It will be worth it all someday.
[1:04:43] For it's all going [music] to be over.
[1:04:47] Do you believe that after a while?
[1:04:51] Cuz you've got one more valley, one more
[1:04:56] hill, one at a time. Oh, you've got one
[1:05:01] more trial, one more tear,
[1:05:05] one more curve, one more curve in life's
[1:05:10] road. Maybe one more mile to go. You can
[1:05:15] lay down that old heavy load when you
[1:05:19] get [music] home. Sing it with me one
[1:05:20] more time. Oh, you've got one more
[1:05:25] valley, [music]
[1:05:26] one more hill. Praise God. And you've
[1:05:31] got one
[1:05:33] more trial, one more [music] tear,
[1:05:38] one more curve in life's road. Maybe one
[1:05:43] more mile to go. You can lay down your
[1:05:48] heavy load when you get home. [music]
[1:05:52] Sing that last line. Oh, you can lay
[1:05:55] down your heavy load when you get home.
[1:06:06] Amen.
[1:06:10] Somebody said, "Well, what in the world
[1:06:11] does that mean? You got one more valley
[1:06:13] and one more hill. You take them one at
[1:06:16] a time.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; And one of these days,
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; one of these days,
[1:06:23] &gt;&gt; that'll that one will be the last one.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; If you try to get out way out there, too
[1:06:30] far ahead of God, it'll overwhelm you.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; But if you'll just look at one more
[1:06:34] curve, one more hill, one more valley,
[1:06:37] one more trial, hadn't he always brought
[1:06:39] us through?
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand and go to the word.
[1:06:43] And while we're standing, let's clap our
[1:06:45] hands and give God praise for these
[1:06:47] wonderful, dedicated,
[1:06:51] faithful, anointed
[1:06:54] musicians.
[1:06:56] Uh Josh and Charity are away this
[1:06:59] weekend celebrating their wedding
[1:07:02] anniversary. Uh they, like us, chose,
[1:07:06] like Stacy and I, they chose
[1:07:07] Thanksgiving for their wedding time. and
[1:07:10] they rarely get to be away on uh dur
[1:07:14] right during that time and it's today I
[1:07:17] don't remember how many years it is
[1:07:18] sister
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; nine years they ought to make it then
[1:07:22] nine years and uh so they'll be
[1:07:26] traveling at some point uh first few
[1:07:28] days of the week so we want to hold them
[1:07:29] up to the Lord in prayer and then
[1:07:31] tomorrow is his birthday brother brother
[1:07:34] Josh's birthday is tomorrow and uh he's
[1:07:38] up there in his 30s young 30s early 30s.
[1:07:42] And then on Thursday,
[1:07:45] uh well, on Tuesday, it's the homegoing
[1:07:48] of Sister Nancy Bergen from Jerusalem.
[1:07:52] And uh for for several years, she served
[1:07:54] this ministry with everything she had in
[1:07:58] her. And I still miss her. Uh she was a
[1:08:02] great blessing to us. And I never had to
[1:08:04] face a trip to Israel with anxiety when
[1:08:07] I knew that she was on the other end
[1:08:09] because she was an Israeli citizen
[1:08:12] originally from upstate New York but had
[1:08:16] lived as a missionary in South Africa
[1:08:18] had landed in the in Jerusalem and had
[1:08:20] never left. She became a citizen and she
[1:08:23] knew the ins and the outs and the ups
[1:08:25] and the downs and she had learned from
[1:08:27] Sister Ruth he how to laugh at all of
[1:08:30] them. And they never complained about
[1:08:32] anything while in the land because they
[1:08:35] believe that if you would give God
[1:08:37] thanks while wherever you are but
[1:08:39] particularly in Jerusalem. If you would
[1:08:41] give God thanks from Jerusalem that he
[1:08:44] would and and be dedicated to your call
[1:08:47] there that he would take care of things
[1:08:48] at home for you. And we saw God do that
[1:08:51] many, many times. And I'm preaching
[1:08:54] again this morning on Samson. And uh
[1:08:57] that that is a a memorable day. Sister
[1:09:00] Stacy was expecting one of I guess
[1:09:03] Mariah. And and Sister Nancy, I had
[1:09:06] found out from some uh Jewish man that
[1:09:09] the tomb of Samson was up on a hill. And
[1:09:12] she and she said, "Well, if you if he
[1:09:14] told you that and you're willing to try
[1:09:16] it, here we go." And I thought I would
[1:09:18] lose my wife. not not by death, but by
[1:09:21] divorce because she she was so pregnant
[1:09:24] and we shook her and shook her and shook
[1:09:26] her and she was holding on for dear
[1:09:28] life. But we got to see where Samson was
[1:09:30] buried and I appreciated that. But
[1:09:33] anyway, I think of her uh on her
[1:09:36] birthday and and uh on the anniversary
[1:09:38] of her death and then on the 27th is
[1:09:41] Eli's birthday and he's asleep, I think.
[1:09:45] And uh we want to thank the Lord for him
[1:09:47] getting to be in Alabama on his
[1:09:50] birthday. Amen.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; And there's probably something I'm
[1:09:53] missing here. Sister Beverly is with her
[1:09:56] family today. Don't forget there's no
[1:09:58] service this Tuesday night, the 25th.
[1:10:01] But there will be a service the
[1:10:03] following Tuesday night on December the
[1:10:05] 2nd. Brother Jordan Peterson and his
[1:10:08] wife uh Martha and the children are
[1:10:10] going to be passing through here, we
[1:10:12] believe, and will be with us that night.
[1:10:14] We're looking forward to seeing them.
[1:10:16] Old friends from Tucson. We have
[1:10:18] fellowship meetings December 6th and
[1:10:20] 7th. That's Saturday night and Sunday
[1:10:22] morning with Brother John Thornton from
[1:10:25] near Raleigh, North Carolina. We're
[1:10:27] looking for the Lord to move in a mighty
[1:10:29] way. We're coming into a month where we
[1:10:32] get a lot of things stirred up. Number
[1:10:36] one, because we don't celebrate
[1:10:37] Christmas and that upsets all
[1:10:40] the folks here and there. And it used to
[1:10:44] be that at least our own tribe stood
[1:10:46] with us, but it's not that way anymore,
[1:10:48] but uh it's something I'm not intending
[1:10:51] to move on. And then we get a little bit
[1:10:53] of persecution around the 14th of
[1:10:56] December this year because we celebrate
[1:10:58] the feast of dedication. Our Lord did in
[1:11:01] John chapter uh was it chapter 10.
[1:11:06] And uh so I like to do that as well. And
[1:11:09] uh I think modern Judaism will just
[1:11:12] mostly refer to it as Hanukkah time. But
[1:11:14] I'm looking forward to it. It's a season
[1:11:16] of miracles. And I don't know about you,
[1:11:19] but I can always use a miracle.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn in your Bible if you will
[1:11:24] again to Hebrews chap 11 for just a
[1:11:27] moment. And I won't read Well, I'm not
[1:11:30] going to tell you what I might do. I'll
[1:11:32] read two or three and let you sit down.
[1:11:34] How about that? Uh verse 32 of Hebrews
[1:11:38] 11, the ending of the great chapter of
[1:11:42] faith, the hall of faith. And what shall
[1:11:44] I more say? For the time would fail me
[1:11:47] to tell of Gideon and of Barack and of
[1:11:50] Samson and of Jeffa, of David also and
[1:11:54] Samuel and of the prophets, who through
[1:11:56] faith who through faith subdued
[1:11:59] kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
[1:12:01] obtained promises, stopped the mouth of
[1:12:04] lions, quenched the violence of fire,
[1:12:06] escaped the edge of the sword. Out of
[1:12:09] weakness were made strong, waxed valiant
[1:12:12] in fight, turned to flight. the armies
[1:12:16] of the aliens. Uh, God bless the reading
[1:12:19] of his word. You may be seated. And I'll
[1:12:22] ask you again this week, how did your
[1:12:24] week go? When you read that, you may
[1:12:27] thought you had a bad week. I had a week
[1:12:29] of hobbling around. But uh when you read
[1:12:32] all of this quench and fiery darts and
[1:12:35] and and all this uh stuff
[1:12:39] running from the violence of fire and
[1:12:41] stop the mouth of lions and escape the
[1:12:43] edge of the sword, then your weak and my
[1:12:45] weak look pretty good, don't they?
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; But we overcome the same way they
[1:12:49] overcome.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; By faith.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; Say it with me. By faith.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; We do.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; God was good. He's good. And uh I know
[1:13:00] you've had some pain and been fighting
[1:13:02] sickness too. No doubt uh even as I
[1:13:04] have. But God has been so faithful. I
[1:13:07] just woke up this morning knowing that
[1:13:09] he had really touched my body. My
[1:13:11] tendonitis was so much better and I
[1:13:15] found a shoe that was low enough in the
[1:13:17] back I could put it on and it's actually
[1:13:18] more comfortable. They the family said,
[1:13:20] "Well, you could just wear Crocs." And I
[1:13:23] said, "But you know, these shoes are
[1:13:24] actually more comfortable than the Croc
[1:13:26] would be. It gives some support for my
[1:13:28] foot and that's how much the Lord has
[1:13:30] touched me and I want to thank him.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Uh women received their dead raised to
[1:13:35] life again. Others were tortured not
[1:13:38] accepting deliverance that they might
[1:13:40] obtain a better resurrection. Others had
[1:13:42] trial of cruel mockings and scourgings.
[1:13:45] Yet moreover of bonds and imprisonment
[1:13:49] they were. Anybody been in prison this
[1:13:51] week?
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you didn't have to be
[1:13:54] there? There are people in this room
[1:13:56] that could have been there today. That's
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Me. Who knows?
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; You never know.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't know that I've done
[1:14:04] anything that would, but that's not
[1:14:06] always what it takes either, is it?
[1:14:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. We saw that during COVID time. You
[1:14:11] can go to jail whether you deserve to go
[1:14:13] or not.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful I didn't have to go.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; They're stoned.
[1:14:19] I may have had some uh harsh words
[1:14:22] hurled at me this week or some I knew
[1:14:25] about and some I didn't know about, but
[1:14:27] I wasn't stoned. It It only might hurt
[1:14:30] my feelings, but it doesn't hurt my
[1:14:32] bones. It doesn't hurt my ability to
[1:14:35] keep going on. Nobody saw me aunderder.
[1:14:39] I did ram something under my fingernail,
[1:14:41] though, and it sure did hurt. But nobody
[1:14:44] saw me aunder. Aren't I glad I am? I
[1:14:48] didn't wander about in sheep skins and
[1:14:50] goat skins. I wasn't destitute,
[1:14:53] afflicted, or tormented. But all of
[1:14:55] these mentioned here went through all of
[1:14:58] that. And I love this so much. As I told
[1:15:01] you last week, verse 38 really gets me.
[1:15:04] Of whom the world was not worthy.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; My the world didn't even know who they
[1:15:11] were. But this world in all of its
[1:15:14] splendor was not worthy to have those
[1:15:16] overcomers walking up and down the
[1:15:19] streets of the towns wandered in deserts
[1:15:22] and mountains and in dens and caves of
[1:15:24] the earth. And these all, no matter what
[1:15:27] they went through, no matter how hard
[1:15:29] their life was, no matter how large
[1:15:32] their sacrifice was, the scripture says
[1:15:36] clearly, very clearly,
[1:15:39] having obtained a good report through
[1:15:41] faith,
[1:15:43] received
[1:15:45] not the promise.
[1:15:48] How is it THAT YOU CAN GIVE UP all that
[1:15:50] and experience all that and pay such a
[1:15:53] large price and still not receive the
[1:15:57] promise?
[1:15:58] God to tell us through the apostle in
[1:16:01] verse 40, God having provided
[1:16:05] some better thing for us
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; that they come on they without us should
[1:16:13] not be made perfect. No wonder they
[1:16:18] gather in the in the uh middles of of of
[1:16:22] eternity and and have vested interest in
[1:16:27] what takes place here on the earth. That
[1:16:29] great cloud of witnesses cheering us on
[1:16:33] because they without us will never find
[1:16:37] their perfection. When we finish as they
[1:16:40] finished, when we overcome as they
[1:16:43] overcome and were gathered together, the
[1:16:45] fullness of the promise of eternal life
[1:16:48] will also be theirs.
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; They are not with, you know, we say with
[1:16:52] the Lord. We say that the scripture says
[1:16:54] to be absent from the body is to be
[1:16:56] present with the Lord. But according to
[1:16:59] the scripture and the message of the
[1:17:01] hour, they're not standing before the
[1:17:03] throne yet.
[1:17:06] They're in another place of absolute
[1:17:08] perfect peace and joy and bliss and rest
[1:17:12] and love and light.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; But when we stand before the throne,
[1:17:16] we're going in together.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Even their old dead body laying
[1:17:23] somewhere has to have a change in it,
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; And there's a reuniting. Brother
[1:17:29] Brandham tells us there's a reuniting
[1:17:31] that takes place. And we go back there
[1:17:34] not to meet the same body but to meet
[1:17:36] another body. We have a transitional
[1:17:39] body that is between the dead body and
[1:17:43] the glorified body for all eternity.
[1:17:45] There's a transition body called a
[1:17:48] theophony where the redeemed life, the
[1:17:52] Zoey life of Jesus Christ in you will
[1:17:55] dwell. And when that that time has
[1:17:59] passed and you enter into a new body,
[1:18:03] one like unto his, scripture tells us
[1:18:07] never again to know uh any kind of uh uh
[1:18:12] sickness or disease or infirmity or
[1:18:15] affliction.
[1:18:16] &gt;&gt; We're going to be with him for all
[1:18:19] eternity.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; I hope I didn't throw some of you.
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; Uh just study the message. Just run it
[1:18:26] and it's there and it'll speak life to
[1:18:28] you and you don't have to wonder what
[1:18:30] there is on the other side. My You'd
[1:18:32] rather be there than here. I'll tell you
[1:18:34] that.
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, I just thought
[1:18:36] they were before the throne." Everybody
[1:18:38] when they leave here, they just go right
[1:18:39] up before the throne. Now I'm very
[1:18:41] disappointed. I thought my mama was
[1:18:43] standing right before the throne. Look,
[1:18:44] look, sweetheart, you're the only one
[1:18:46] complaining. Mama's not.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; She'd rather be where she is right now
[1:18:51] than on this earth.
[1:18:53] Somebody said, "Well, you know, she
[1:18:54] don't love me. She doesn't. My loved
[1:18:56] ones don't miss me." No, brother,
[1:18:58] sister. I'm sorry to tell you, they
[1:18:59] don't miss you.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; They They know you. They know where you
[1:19:02] are. They often know things that are
[1:19:04] happening because they're cheering you
[1:19:06] on.
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; But they're not just longing for you.
[1:19:09] They're at perfect peace.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; But they will have their perfection when
[1:19:13] we all meet together. Won't that be
[1:19:15] great?
[1:19:16] &gt;&gt; Are you here?
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So am I. Let's turn to Judges
[1:19:22] chapter 13. Now, we're talking about the
[1:19:26] anointing and and for a few weeks, we're
[1:19:30] talking now about Samson's anointing. I
[1:19:33] think it's important. The Lord directed
[1:19:35] me in this direction. And and in the
[1:19:38] next few services, perhaps not today,
[1:19:41] but we will get to it eventually. I want
[1:19:44] to talk to you about the glory of the
[1:19:47] latter and how much greater even in the
[1:19:49] life of Samson. The glory of the latter
[1:19:53] was so so uh significant. He went out of
[1:19:57] here with a greater glory
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; than the one he came in here with. And
[1:20:01] so will this little bride.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Do you believe you'll know him when he
[1:20:06] comes?
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; You know why you'll know him? Because
[1:20:09] you're going to be just like him.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture said. Isn't
[1:20:13] that good?
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're reading now for just a
[1:20:17] moment about Samson. I don't want to go
[1:20:20] too far backward, but let's look at uh
[1:20:23] Judges 13:4 and5. Now, therefore,
[1:20:25] beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine.
[1:20:28] This is the message of the angel of the
[1:20:31] Lord to the mother of Samson. Don't
[1:20:36] drink wine or strong drink, and eat not
[1:20:39] any unclean thing. For lo, even though
[1:20:43] you've been barren, for lo, thou shalt
[1:20:45] conceive and bear a son, and he too will
[1:20:49] be set apart, no razor shall come on his
[1:20:53] head. For the child shall be a Nazerite
[1:20:56] unto God from the womb, which is a new
[1:20:59] concept. The Nazerite vow in the book of
[1:21:02] Numbers chapter 6 was something that a
[1:21:05] man or woman chose. There was a
[1:21:08] duration.
[1:21:10] It was not something they were born
[1:21:12] with. It was something that they took
[1:21:14] before the Lord. And there were
[1:21:16] restrictions of what they could
[1:21:18] participate in, what they could come in
[1:21:20] contact with during that time. When the
[1:21:23] days of the vow were expired, they were
[1:21:26] free from the Nazerite vow and they went
[1:21:28] on and lived their normal life. But God
[1:21:31] spoke to the mother of Samson, her name
[1:21:34] is not even mentioned in the scripture,
[1:21:36] and said, "You set yourself apart, for
[1:21:40] the for the child that you're going to
[1:21:42] conceive will be a Nazerite from the
[1:21:45] womb, and he shall begin to deliver
[1:21:48] Israel out of the hand of the
[1:21:52] Philistines." 40 years of torture and
[1:21:55] torment Israel had been given by the
[1:21:58] Lord into the hands of the enemy. Do you
[1:22:01] remember that? And God said, "I'm not
[1:22:03] going to bring deliverance all at one
[1:22:05] time." Sometimes he brings it
[1:22:07] instantaneously,
[1:22:09] suddenly. It just overtakes a person.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; But most of the time it's gradually,
[1:22:15] gradually, gradually, gradually, and
[1:22:17] then what? SUDDENLY, GOD SAID, "I'M NOT
[1:22:20] GOING TO DELIVER Israel all at once
[1:22:22] because if they got out from under the
[1:22:24] load all at once, they'd quickly forget
[1:22:26] the lessons that I wanted them to learn
[1:22:28] under the hand of the enemy."
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; So, he said, "I'm going to leave them
[1:22:31] there for a while, and I'm going to
[1:22:33] begin deliverance. I'm going to put a
[1:22:35] light at the end of the tunnel." How
[1:22:37] many of you have ever been looking for
[1:22:38] that light?
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; I'm going to put just a little hope
[1:22:41] where there has been no hope. And I'm
[1:22:43] going to let them know that even though
[1:22:45] I brought the oppressor against them,
[1:22:47] I'm going to begin to bring them out of
[1:22:49] his hand.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; I'm going to send a special child. And
[1:22:53] you're the one that's going to carry
[1:22:54] him, little mother. And he will begin to
[1:22:58] he will begin to deliver Israel out of
[1:23:02] the hands of the Philistines. I want to
[1:23:05] read one quotation from last Sunday. The
[1:23:07] God of this evil age, 1965. Brother
[1:23:10] Brandham said, "A Nazerite is one that
[1:23:13] is consecrated for a purpose."
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; I wonder, is there anybody in here today
[1:23:20] consecrated for a purpose? Let me see
[1:23:21] your hand. Let me see your hand.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Uh consecrated for a purpose. He said
[1:23:27] Samson was consecrated to a age and to a
[1:23:31] purpose. Therefore, he had long hair.
[1:23:33] And he said, "The woman that's a child
[1:23:35] of God lets her hair grow to show that
[1:23:38] she's consecrated to every word of God."
[1:23:43] I believe that that's no condemnation
[1:23:46] for anyone who isn't there yet. It's
[1:23:49] just the truth. And as I told you last
[1:23:52] week, is it's easier than you think. You
[1:23:54] just quit chopping it. And guess what?
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; It'll grow as long as God will let it.
[1:24:00] For some people, that's almost to the
[1:24:01] ground. and to other people it's barely
[1:24:04] past her shoulder. But it's a sign
[1:24:06] regardless when a woman makes that
[1:24:09] dedication in a world today that'll tell
[1:24:11] you uh as a woman you'd look younger if
[1:24:14] you chop it off. You'd look younger if
[1:24:16] you'd make it another color. You'd look
[1:24:18] younger if you permed it with some kind
[1:24:20] of dangerous chemical
[1:24:23] and uh the pressure is on.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; But when a woman says no Siri, it
[1:24:29] doesn't even belong to me. Right?
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; This is put here by the Lord.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; It's a way that God established that he
[1:24:36] would put a a sign of her submission on
[1:24:40] her head. And the scripture says it's
[1:24:42] power on her head.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; I tell you, brothers, don't we don't
[1:24:45] have power on our head.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; We're we're the head of course of the
[1:24:50] family, but this the woman has power
[1:24:53] over her head. You may not appreciate
[1:24:56] this example, but uh there there's a
[1:24:59] she's still alive. Her name is Fetus.
[1:25:03] I've never known a woman other woman
[1:25:05] anywhere by the name of Fetus. Have you
[1:25:07] tu?
[1:25:09] Her name is Fetus Tenny. And [snorts]
[1:25:12] her husband was the general
[1:25:14] superintendent of the United Pentecostal
[1:25:16] Church International.
[1:25:18] Their son left the holiness of the of
[1:25:20] his childhood and wrote the book The
[1:25:22] Godchasers. His name is Tommy Tenny. But
[1:25:26] Sister Thetus is a uh she attends the
[1:25:29] POA in Alexandria, Louisiana. And she's
[1:25:32] been a Bible teacher her whole life. And
[1:25:35] uh she was invited to come to a big big
[1:25:38] charismatic convention where no one in
[1:25:41] the room had had any hair.
[1:25:45] Just little poodle little poodle styles,
[1:25:47] you know, and uh Jacqueline Kennedy
[1:25:50] styles. And there was a preacher who who
[1:25:53] got up ahead of her. His name is James
[1:25:55] G. I've met him several times. And he
[1:25:58] got under such inspiration,
[1:26:00] a charismatic got under such inspiration
[1:26:04] about about Sister Theta sitting there,
[1:26:07] a woman of prayer and having that long
[1:26:10] hair on her head. And he said,
[1:26:12] regardless of what we moderns think
[1:26:14] about it, he said, the scriptures clear.
[1:26:16] She has a special authority with God
[1:26:18] because she's made this vow.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said that to all these women. I
[1:26:23] think they said there was 1,200 people
[1:26:24] there. And he asked sister only sisters
[1:26:28] will appreciate this sacrifice.
[1:26:31] Uh he asked her I would have never done
[1:26:34] such a thing I don't think unless the
[1:26:36] Lord made me. But he said sister theus I
[1:26:39] would love it if you would just take
[1:26:40] your hair out. Take it down and show
[1:26:44] people the authority that God has placed
[1:26:47] on your head. and and can you imagine a
[1:26:50] sister who's got it all pinned up neat
[1:26:52] and so [clears throat] forth and then
[1:26:54] the connotation, you know, of a woman
[1:26:55] letting her hair down and all of these
[1:26:57] things. And she said, "Before I even
[1:26:59] KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING," she said, "I had
[1:27:02] a nudge."
[1:27:03] And that nudge let me know that somebody
[1:27:06] there needed the message. Amen.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; She said, "I wasn't scheduled to teach
[1:27:10] the Bible that day, but she said, I had
[1:27:12] this strong impression that I was about
[1:27:14] to teach a bunch of women
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; something about their prayer life."
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; And she began to take it down. And they
[1:27:22] I wasn't there, but I saw a portion of
[1:27:25] that service years later. And the glory
[1:27:27] and the spirit of God honored that dear
[1:27:30] woman, that dear mother.
[1:27:33] And the spirit of the Lord moved across
[1:27:35] that place. And there were women who
[1:27:37] stood in line to tell her, "I have
[1:27:41] received a revelation today. I'll never
[1:27:44] cut mine again. I want whatever it was
[1:27:47] that swept over this room when yours was
[1:27:50] down. I want that authority. I want to
[1:27:53] feel that in prayer." And if it's a co a
[1:27:55] price to pay, what a small price to pay.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; Isn't that amazing? Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; I wish Pentecostals I wish I wish
[1:28:03] everybody could catch a glimpse of what
[1:28:05] God has done for that sister to require
[1:28:08] that of her but also giving her a
[1:28:10] special authority in her prayer. It's a
[1:28:13] type of bridal intercession and it's the
[1:28:15] most powerful intercession on the face
[1:28:17] of the planet. The bride's cry, the
[1:28:20] bride's prayer uh is a powerful thing
[1:28:23] and it's a sign of a separation. It was
[1:28:26] to Samson and it is even today. Are you
[1:28:29] still here?
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; So then in verse 3 and 4 of Numbers
[1:28:34] chapter 6, it begins to give more of
[1:28:38] what this Nazerite vow would look like.
[1:28:41] And that would be that a person would
[1:28:43] separate themsel from wine and strong
[1:28:45] drink and vinegar of wine and uh not no
[1:28:49] grapes. You couldn't eat moist grapes or
[1:28:52] dried grapes. Uh it it was not allowed.
[1:28:55] And then in verse five, uh, all the days
[1:28:58] of the vow of his separation, there
[1:29:00] shall no razor come upon his head until
[1:29:04] the days be fulfilled in the which he
[1:29:06] separated himself unto the Lord. He
[1:29:08] shall be holy and shall let the locks of
[1:29:10] the hair of his head grow, which is
[1:29:13] against nature itself, the scripture
[1:29:15] tells us. So for a man, it's a sacrifice
[1:29:18] in under this Nazerite vow to do such a
[1:29:21] thing. Now, nobody is calling you.
[1:29:24] Nobody is encouraging you in the
[1:29:27] dispensation of grace that you would
[1:29:30] take that kind of a vow.
[1:29:32] But it is it is certainly a type of the
[1:29:36] holiness separated consecrated life.
[1:29:40] Just a minute. Amen brother.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; And it's not optional
[1:29:45] for the overcomer.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; The nominal Christian.
[1:29:50] It seems to be calling on the name of
[1:29:53] the Lord is what is required. And we
[1:29:56] don't even know how the rest of it is
[1:29:58] going to shake out.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; But what we do know is the overcomer is
[1:30:03] going to get a hold of that book.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And we're going to live it to the best
[1:30:07] of our ability.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:10] &gt;&gt; And we want to raise our children with
[1:30:13] answers.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Not because I said so. We want to answer
[1:30:19] them with answers. with Bible answers,
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; something that might help them as they
[1:30:24] go along. So Samson was going to be a
[1:30:27] Nazerite from the time of his birth. He
[1:30:29] could come not come in contact with the
[1:30:32] vine, the grape, anything to do with the
[1:30:34] grape. He could not come near a dead
[1:30:37] body and he could not put a razor on his
[1:30:42] head. His hair was to be divided into
[1:30:45] seven locks. Look at how spiritual, how
[1:30:48] prophetic, how symbolic it was that his
[1:30:52] hair would be divided by seven locks.
[1:30:55] What a number seven is. Some people call
[1:30:58] it God's divine number. It's a number of
[1:31:01] wholeness and a number of completion and
[1:31:04] a number of perfection. God was about to
[1:31:07] bring a deliverer who would not only
[1:31:10] begin to deliver Israel, but he would
[1:31:13] set an example even for us today that
[1:31:16] you can slip, you can fail, you can make
[1:31:19] a mistake, but if you'll stay faithful,
[1:31:22] if you'll bring yourself BACK TO THE
[1:31:25] PURPOSE of your birth in repentance,
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; that God will not even remember against
[1:31:31] you the sin, the failure, the shame that
[1:31:35] you brought.
[1:31:36] This is good news.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; I don't know about you, but I've
[1:31:40] disappointed him before.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; And so for me, it's very good news.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; In Judges chapter 13, verse 24 and 25,
[1:31:49] and the woman bare a son and called his
[1:31:53] name Samson, and the child grew, and the
[1:31:57] Lord blessed him. He was blessed in his
[1:32:01] mother's womb and he came from his
[1:32:04] mother's womb still under the blessing.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S VERSE 25 that I want to
[1:32:09] emphasize to you today. And the spirit
[1:32:13] of the Lord, this is Judges 13:25.
[1:32:18] And the spirit of the Lord began
[1:32:23] as he was going to begin to deliver
[1:32:26] Israel. The spirit of the Lord began to
[1:32:30] move him at times.
[1:32:34] Are you hearing that?
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; In the camp of Dan between Zora and
[1:32:40] Echol,
[1:32:42] you ought to remember. It has something
[1:32:44] to do with the grapes. You can look that
[1:32:47] up. He he was from a place between Zora
[1:32:51] and Echol. The key is this verse 25. And
[1:32:57] the spirit of the Lord began to move
[1:33:03] upon him born with a blessing, his
[1:33:06] childhood under a blessing. And then
[1:33:08] there came a time that the spirit of the
[1:33:12] Lord began to move upon him. The New
[1:33:18] King James says the same. And the spirit
[1:33:20] of the Lord began to move upon him.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; And and another version said, "And the
[1:33:26] spirit of the Lord began to stir him."
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; There's something different about this
[1:33:32] movement of the spirit on the life of
[1:33:35] Samson. Remember his name means sunlike,
[1:33:38] like the sun, little sun, ball of fire,
[1:33:42] belonging to the sun. It it's a
[1:33:45] beautiful picture because the
[1:33:46] Philistines were a culture steeped in
[1:33:49] darkness.
[1:33:50] And in dealing with darkness, what did
[1:33:52] God send? He sends a little son,
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Sam's son. Do you know that's what God
[1:33:58] sending in this last hour?
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; An overcoming bride.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; Little sons.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; CHIPS OFF THE OLD BLOCK. HE tells us.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. THE SAME LIFE THAT was in him in
[1:34:13] us. The same anointing that was on him
[1:34:17] on us. Not on us only, but in us.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; So what did God do to deal with
[1:34:22] darkness? He sent light. He sent
[1:34:25] sunlight. Didn't he do it?
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; So the spirit of the Lord began to move
[1:34:30] on him. Not all the time.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; He didn't WALK IN IT ALL THE TIME.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; BUT AT TIMES, somebody say at times.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; At times,
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; the spirit of the Lord began to move on
[1:34:43] him. At times,
[1:34:47] the Hebrew phrases describing the spirit
[1:34:50] of the Lord coming upon Samson here are
[1:34:53] extremely vivid and they're violent.
[1:34:57] Somebody say violent.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Violent.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; A and full of prophetic depth. These are
[1:35:02] not mild terms like all of a sudden you
[1:35:05] just begin to feel something precious
[1:35:08] slipping over you. You know, you just
[1:35:10] come under some Have you done it? I
[1:35:12] have. Have you ever just come under what
[1:35:14] felt like oil? just just the sweet grace
[1:35:17] of God just moving very slowly his
[1:35:22] anointing reminding you of Aaron's uh uh
[1:35:25] oil that dripped down when he was
[1:35:27] anointed all the way down his garment
[1:35:29] just slowly moving down all the way down
[1:35:32] to the ends of his beard
[1:35:35] and dripping down his robe is ifad and
[1:35:38] all the way down rolling down his from
[1:35:41] his uh bottom of his ephod all the way
[1:35:45] down his legs and down to the very
[1:35:48] bottoms of his feet, the top of his
[1:35:52] ankle, just slowly, sweetly
[1:35:56] moving. But that's not what's being
[1:35:58] described here.
[1:36:00] This is a violent overtaking of someone
[1:36:05] by the spirit of the Lord. I won't ask
[1:36:08] you if you've ever experienced this, but
[1:36:10] I have.
[1:36:12] Rare occasion, but I have and I'm
[1:36:15] thankful. I wouldn't mind a little more
[1:36:17] of this. We're going to need it in the
[1:36:19] days ahead.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, this described even though it
[1:36:24] says, "And the spirit of the Lord began
[1:36:25] to move on him or move him at times."
[1:36:32] Move him is the emphasis. not move on
[1:36:35] him or over him but move him.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; You get it?
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; These words are beautiful. The word in
[1:36:42] Hebrew is pam and it's a verb meaning to
[1:36:46] stir, to be stirred, to be troubled. It
[1:36:51] indicates an agitation.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Something that agitates,
[1:36:56] troubles, bothers a person, forcing them
[1:37:01] to act.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:05] It's one thing to be led, gently led.
[1:37:09] It's another thing to have the spirit of
[1:37:11] the Lord come on you
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; and push you into a situation
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; that you'd have been standing on the
[1:37:16] shore watching for a long time had you
[1:37:19] had your own choice.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; You know, God's got a way of getting his
[1:37:22] job done.
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; He's got a way of getting his work done.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; And he may just have to start pushing
[1:37:28] us. Amen.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; It means to stir, to trouble, to thrust,
[1:37:34] to push, to beat violently.
[1:37:38] IT MEANS TO PULSE LIKE A HAMMER.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; The spirit of the LORD BEGAN TO PULSE
[1:37:45] HIM LIKE a hammer.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; I'm just telling you what the word
[1:37:48] means. It
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; It's It's certainly different than just
[1:37:52] a warm feeling just began to overtake
[1:37:55] him. I want you to see IT MEANS TO IMPEL
[1:37:58] someone into action.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; It's like inertia pushing them forward.
[1:38:05] This isn't gentle prompting.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; It carries the idea of a divine STIRRING
[1:38:10] THAT FEELS MORE like an internal
[1:38:12] pounding.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; God hammering
[1:38:16] a calling into him.
[1:38:20] In Jewish interpretation, it's the
[1:38:22] spirit driving him, not Samson
[1:38:25] initiating anything
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; on his own.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Some people jump out. Hear this.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; SOME PEOPLE JUMP out ahead of God and
[1:38:35] then blame God.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't want to do it. I didn't
[1:38:40] really want to do it. That's not what I
[1:38:41] really wanted to do. Wrong.
[1:38:45] You did what you wanted to do. And now
[1:38:48] you're going to blame God
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; because somebody looked at you like
[1:38:51] you've lost your mind.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; That's not what we're talking about.
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE lacking
[1:38:59] wisdom.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; Being foolish,
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; being weird,
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; and stepping out to do something and
[1:39:09] blaming God for it. He's tired of being
[1:39:12] blamed for our foolishness. Amen.
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; We're talking about the spirit of the
[1:39:16] Lord coming mightily on Samson. And the
[1:39:20] the scripture is beautiful here because
[1:39:22] it helps us to understand that Samson
[1:39:24] didn't initiate any of this on his own.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; He didn't even know he WAS GOING TO KILL
[1:39:30] A LION.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; He didn't even KNOW HE WAS GOING TO KILL
[1:39:34] 30 Philistines
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; just because he could. HE DIDN'T KNOW HE
[1:39:39] WAS GOING TO TAKE A JAWBONE OF AN ASS
[1:39:41] AND slay a thousand men.
[1:39:44] &gt;&gt; He didn't even know he was going to walk
[1:39:46] off with the gates of Gaza.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; But each time the scriptures clear, the
[1:39:53] spirit of the Lord came mightily upon
[1:39:55] him. It began to move him. It impelled
[1:39:59] him. It drove him. IT BEAT INSIDE of him
[1:40:03] like a hammer. Lord.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; A few weeks ago, I talked to you about a
[1:40:07] burden from the Lord that I was carrying
[1:40:11] at the time. And when I found the Hebrew
[1:40:14] meanings of some of these words, it
[1:40:16] helped me more than anything I found in
[1:40:18] a long time because it's how it was
[1:40:20] feeling on the inside. My heart was
[1:40:23] pounding like a hammer and I couldn't
[1:40:26] get out from under it. No matter what I
[1:40:28] tried, there was no way to relax
[1:40:31] yourself out of it. There was no way to
[1:40:33] break out from under it. It was like
[1:40:36] something had had overtaken the inside
[1:40:39] of me and was just pounding me to
[1:40:41] prayer, to pray, to read the word, to
[1:40:44] study, to get ready because God was
[1:40:46] about to do something. I I don't want to
[1:40:49] ever get out from under it completely.
[1:40:51] But I'm thankful that he gives us a
[1:40:53] little relief sometime so that we can
[1:40:55] live a life, a normal life, at least
[1:40:57] every now and again. It's a serious
[1:41:00] thing. It's not just for a special
[1:41:02] person. It's for whoever will surrender,
[1:41:05] whoever will yield. There's an anointing
[1:41:08] that is promised for the bride in the
[1:41:11] scripture and in the message that's
[1:41:13] beyond just a good feeling.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; HE SAID IT'S A PERSON
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S WANTING TO TAKE OCCUPATION.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO NOT JUST VISIT YOU. HE WANTS
[1:41:27] TO OCCUPY YOU.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND IN ORDER TO PREPARE YOUR HOUSE
[1:41:32] for him to come and take over, YOU'VE
[1:41:35] GOT TO WATCH YOUR EYE GATE. YOU'VE GOT
[1:41:36] TO GUARD YOUR EYE GATE. YOU'VE GOT TO
[1:41:38] GUARD YOUR EAR GATE.
[1:41:40] &gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO GUARD YOUR MOUTH GATE.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; He told us you're not going anywhere
[1:41:46] else. You're not going any further.
[1:41:48] Nothing great else is happening unless
[1:41:50] you're willing
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; to pay a greater price.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Let's look at this for a moment. the
[1:41:56] spirit of the Lord.
[1:41:59] I I think maybe I might have given them
[1:42:02] uh part of this definition to come.
[1:42:06] Maybe I didn't give them the the one for
[1:42:08] spirit. But but the spirit, the Hebrew
[1:42:11] word there is ruah or ru.
[1:42:16] It's a feminine noun.
[1:42:19] Remember that in Hebrew, every noun has
[1:42:23] a masculine and a feminine form, even
[1:42:26] the table.
[1:42:27] And the table takes on a na a feminine
[1:42:30] form or a or a male form
[1:42:34] depending on who's at the table or what
[1:42:38] the table is for. So in Hebrew, the form
[1:42:42] of the noun changes depending on the
[1:42:46] [clears throat] person that is
[1:42:47] connected. Do you understand that? And
[1:42:50] so I would use a different word for
[1:42:52] table. If I was talking about uh Sister
[1:42:55] April is using that table for her puzzle
[1:42:58] that she's putting together. Uh that
[1:43:00] would be different than for me to say
[1:43:02] brother Robert is studying uh on that
[1:43:05] table. And then in Hebrew we would use a
[1:43:08] different word altogether for table
[1:43:10] which makes it so complicated. You think
[1:43:13] English is complicated. Thank God in
[1:43:15] English we don't have to change the
[1:43:16] whole structure of the sentence
[1:43:18] depending on the male or the female that
[1:43:20] may be using the table or cleaning the
[1:43:22] table or whatever. So don't be offended
[1:43:24] or or thrown off by the fact that this
[1:43:28] ruach or ruah is a feminine form of a
[1:43:32] noun. It means spirit. It means wind. It
[1:43:36] means breath. But it's NOT USUALLY
[1:43:38] REFERRING TO ordinary wind ordinary
[1:43:42] breath. It's generally referring to that
[1:43:45] of deity, of God, God's wind, God's
[1:43:49] breath, God's spirit. And this noun
[1:43:54] occurs 387
[1:43:57] times in the Old Testament and almost
[1:43:59] all of those times referred to in the
[1:44:02] feminine form. The spirit, the breath,
[1:44:08] the wind of God began to blow on Samson.
[1:44:14] What makes this particular place that's
[1:44:18] translated in English, the spirit of the
[1:44:20] Lord, what makes this different is the
[1:44:23] Hebrew word that's placed with it, which
[1:44:26] is a verb. And the Hebrew word is tlah.
[1:44:31] And it comes from a Hebrew word salah.
[1:44:35] Oh, here it is. A verb meaning to rush,
[1:44:40] to break forth, to come mightily. It
[1:44:45] describes the Holy Spirit's effect on
[1:44:47] persons
[1:44:49] making them powerful or particularly
[1:44:54] strong. Uh, is that all or do you have
[1:44:58] the rest of it? And it gives some
[1:45:00] references. Judges 14:6 and 9:15 and 14
[1:45:04] 1st Samuel 16:13 of where this form of
[1:45:09] the spirit of the Lord is used. It has
[1:45:12] caused persons to prophesy and there are
[1:45:16] the references there in 1 Samuel. It has
[1:45:18] the sense of persons breaking out.
[1:45:20] Listen, breaking out. THE SPIRIT OF THE
[1:45:24] LORD BROKE OUT on Samson. It speaks of
[1:45:28] rushing forward into a battle. I don't
[1:45:32] know who's anxious to go into a battle
[1:45:34] and risk his life. But if the spirit of
[1:45:36] the Lord is rushing you,
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; if the spirit of the Lord is breaking
[1:45:40] out on you, you'll find yourself doing
[1:45:43] something that you wouldn't be
[1:45:44] comfortable doing just of your own
[1:45:46] natural ability or decision. Amen. Send
[1:45:49] it, Lord. It also can mean God breaking
[1:45:53] out in acts of judgment as in Amos 5
[1:45:55] and6. So please understand that what
[1:45:59] Samson was experiencing was the spirit
[1:46:02] of the Lord coming on him mightily in a
[1:46:06] breakthrough form pushing him compelling
[1:46:10] HIM. WHY? BECAUSE HE WAS born for a
[1:46:14] purpose. I want to tell you TODAY THAT
[1:46:16] FOR WHATEVER REASON YOU WERE BORN, GOD
[1:46:20] HAS AN ANOINTING
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; THAT IS SUFFICIENT. HE HAS AN ANOINTING
[1:46:24] THAT IS JUST RIGHT for whatever your
[1:46:27] position is. If he's called YOU AS AN
[1:46:30] EVANGELIST, HE HAS AN ANOINTING THAT'S
[1:46:33] BIG ENOUGH AND BOLD ENOUGH and powerful
[1:46:36] enough to make you an evangelist.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; If he's CALLED YOU TO PROPHESY, HE HAS
[1:46:42] AN ANOINTING THAT'S JUST RIGHT.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; It's not going to trickle down on your
[1:46:48] head like a drippy faucet. It's going to
[1:46:51] rush over you more like a waterfall.
[1:46:54] Grant it, Lord.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; GRANT IT, OH GOD. SOMEBODY SAID, "THIS
[1:46:58] IS OLD TESTAMENT. Are you KIDDING ME?"
[1:47:01] ACTS CHAPTER 2.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Do you think THAT WAS A DRIPPY FAUCET
[1:47:05] THAT CAME IN THE UPPER ROOM?
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; Or was IT WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAID IT
[1:47:09] WAS? AND A RUSHING MIGHTY WIND BEGAN TO
[1:47:14] BLOW [screaming] INTO THAT ROOM. COME
[1:47:16] ON.
[1:47:18] AND UH IT APPEARED OVER THEIR HEAD LIKE
[1:47:20] CLOVEN TONGUES OF FIRE and everyone
[1:47:23] began to speak in languages that they
[1:47:25] had never learned.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the church was being born.
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that's the
[1:47:30] original Catholic church. Anything after
[1:47:33] that is the imitation.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE CHURCH.
[1:47:37] The birthing of the church was on the
[1:47:39] day of Pentecost. AND HE DIDN'T BIRTHE
[1:47:41] IT WITH A TRICKLE OF ANOINTING.
[1:47:44] HE BIRTHED IT WITH A WATERFALL,
[1:47:47] &gt;&gt; A MIGHTY TSUNAMI OF his anointing.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know, this bride is
[1:47:53] going to need MORE THAN A DRIPPY FAUCET.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; WE GOT SOME STUFF TO OVERCOME.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; And we're GOING TO NEED IT TO BREAK IN
[1:48:02] MIGHTILY IN OUR LIVES. THEN WE MUST
[1:48:05] PREPARE.
[1:48:06] THEN WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE
[1:48:09] LETTING THE LORD BUILD A HOUSE IN US
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; THAT'S SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO know when
[1:48:15] it's time
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; for a trickle
[1:48:20] and it's time to be bold.
[1:48:23] David would be ANOINTED TO PLAY SOOTHING
[1:48:25] music
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; on the harp to soothe the tormenting
[1:48:30] spirit that had taken over the life of
[1:48:32] God's once anointed and now tormented
[1:48:35] King Saul. And David would come with
[1:48:38] this soft anointing and he would play
[1:48:41] that soothing music and even the demon
[1:48:44] spirits that had taken over Saul's life
[1:48:47] would have to calm down in the presence
[1:48:49] of that calm, sweet, restful, peaceful
[1:48:52] anointing. God knew what David needed at
[1:48:54] the moment. But when David was facing
[1:48:57] Goliath, he didn't need that calm,
[1:49:01] sweet,
[1:49:02] quiet, sacred. They like to say, these
[1:49:06] corn uh uh uh hillbillies, I'll say it
[1:49:10] that way. These hillbillies didn't know
[1:49:11] what sacred was until they read it in
[1:49:14] the message. But now they love to use
[1:49:16] that word sacred, which is really a
[1:49:18] description of a dead church or a dead
[1:49:21] service or a lifeless bunch of people.
[1:49:23] And they call that sacred. That's not
[1:49:25] sacred. Sacred is getting under the
[1:49:28] presence of the Lord. IF IT'S CALM AND
[1:49:30] IT'S HIM, IT'S SACRED. BUT IF IT'S
[1:49:33] MIGHTY
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; AND IT'S HIM,
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; it's still sacred.
[1:49:39] &gt;&gt; It's sacred because it's yielded. It's
[1:49:42] surrendered and it's divine. It's not
[1:49:45] sacred because it's quiet.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Somebody said, "Oh, I like I like
[1:49:52] more Fanny Crosby hymns because they're
[1:49:54] sacred." Well, I want you to know that
[1:49:57] every every hymn that Fanny Crosby wrote
[1:50:01] wasn't calm, quiet, soothing.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; She understood in her condition that
[1:50:08] there was a time that the spirit of the
[1:50:10] Lord wanted to bubble up and rise up and
[1:50:12] raise up in people. I like them both. I
[1:50:16] like the peace that that sweet
[1:50:20] manifestation. Same spirit. Please
[1:50:22] understand. Same spirit OF THE LORD.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; SAME SPIRIT OF the Lord,
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; but a different manifestation. I like to
[1:50:29] just sit and weep gently, quietly in his
[1:50:33] presence. But I also like to dance like
[1:50:36] a drunk man
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; when the spirit of the Lord comes down.
[1:50:40] See, the same David that played the
[1:50:42] quiet harp under the anointing of the
[1:50:44] Lord needed another form, another
[1:50:47] manifestation of the same anointing when
[1:50:50] he faced a giant. WHEN HE SAW THE ARK OF
[1:50:53] THE COVENANT WAS COMING BACK from the
[1:50:55] house of Oed EDOM AND WOULD NOW DWELL IN
[1:50:57] a tent, the tabernacle of David WITH AN
[1:51:00] OPEN CHAMBER ON MOUNT ZION. AND HE began
[1:51:03] to dance before the Lord. He didn't do
[1:51:05] it in the same calm,
[1:51:08] &gt;&gt; anointing,
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; soothing, sacred, sweet
[1:51:14] manifestation that he had played for
[1:51:17] Saul. Oh no. He danced like a wild man.
[1:51:22] And he said to his uh uh uh
[1:51:25] denominational wife, he said to her, "If
[1:51:29] you don't shut your mouth,"
[1:51:33] King James says, "Hold your peace." The
[1:51:36] Hebrew didn't say hold your peace.
[1:51:40] It would be translated more like shut
[1:51:42] your trap.
[1:51:46] Shut up.
[1:51:49] SAME KIND OF EXPRESSION JOB HAD TO USE.
[1:51:52] YOU TALK LIKE A FOOLISH WOMAN. SHUT YOUR
[1:51:55] MOUTH.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; It's not nice to tell people to shut up
[1:52:00] and accept in certain circumstances.
[1:52:02] This was A GOOD CIRCUMSTANCE.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP, I'M
[1:52:08] GOING TO BE WILDER,
[1:52:10] VIER,
[1:52:12] MORE ENTHUSIASTIC WHEN I DANCE THE NEXT
[1:52:15] TIME."
[1:52:16] Was he anointed? He was.
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; He was. The spirit of the Lord moved in
[1:52:22] that meeting that day and it was the
[1:52:24] same spirit and it was the same
[1:52:26] anointing of God but it moved in a
[1:52:29] different manifestation.
[1:52:31] Please be careful how you judge. Uh your
[1:52:36] discernment needs to be highly and
[1:52:38] finely tuned because we need to know. We
[1:52:43] can recognize that it's him but we need
[1:52:45] to know how does he want to move? Does
[1:52:48] he want to come and come in and calm us
[1:52:51] and soothe us like the bomb of Gilead?
[1:52:54] Or does he want to come IN AND LIGHT A
[1:52:57] FIRE UNDER US?
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; That we can't contain.
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; I know brother Brandon makes a few
[1:53:05] little statements along the way about
[1:53:07] not losing control. Well, I want you to
[1:53:10] know I'm sorry to say that that's
[1:53:12] exactly what this scripture means in
[1:53:15] Hebrew. The spirit of the Lord came so
[1:53:18] mightily on Samson that in that moment
[1:53:22] it would have been nearly impossible for
[1:53:25] him to do anything but what the spirit
[1:53:28] drove him do.
[1:53:30] &gt;&gt; I can see where that would be very
[1:53:31] helpful for some of us hesitators.
[1:53:42] We put it off and put it off.
[1:53:46] We wait on that gentle breeze.
[1:53:50] Come on.
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; And then the tsunami hits and we're
[1:53:54] picking up pieces because we've moved
[1:53:58] and it can't be undone.
[1:54:02] I don't KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT I'VE
[1:54:03] [screaming] MOVED before
[1:54:05] because I was compelled to move, driven
[1:54:08] to move.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; And as soon as that anointing lifted, I
[1:54:12] would have done everything within my
[1:54:13] power to have undone it.
[1:54:18] But there's no undoing what's done.
[1:54:21] &gt;&gt; It's particularly when God has done it.
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; And there's battles that must be fought.
[1:54:27] There's situations that must be
[1:54:29] confronted.
[1:54:30] And we're going to have to have a
[1:54:32] breaking out, a rushing forward into
[1:54:35] battle. We're going to have to know all
[1:54:37] the different ways the anointing of the
[1:54:39] Lord can move on us.
[1:54:43] &gt;&gt; I want you to know it was the same
[1:54:44] spirit of God that operated in the
[1:54:46] ministry of Moses.
[1:54:49] Same spirit of God operated in the
[1:54:51] ministry of Moses that operated in the
[1:54:53] ministry of Joshua. Same spirit of the
[1:54:56] Lord, same anointing, same shecka,
[1:55:01] but there was a different
[1:55:02] administration.
[1:55:04] There was a different government.
[1:55:07] There was a different form and there was
[1:55:09] a different approach.
[1:55:11] Same spirit, same anointing, but a
[1:55:14] different government, a different
[1:55:16] administration, handled differently.
[1:55:19] Same word, same truth, same experience
[1:55:22] with God. But the season changed. And
[1:55:26] when the season changed, the anointing
[1:55:28] remained the same. The word remained the
[1:55:31] same. But the way that word was handled
[1:55:35] and THE WAY THINGS WERE DEALT WITH, IT
[1:55:38] BECAME DIFFERENT. AND IT HAD TO. AND IT
[1:55:41] HAS TO AGAIN.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:55:45] &gt;&gt; It has to again.
[1:55:47] IT'S JUST THE WAY OF GOD. IT'S THE WAY
[1:55:50] HE WORKS. It's the way he moves.
[1:55:53] HE MOVED THE SAME ANOINTING THAT MOVED
[1:55:56] IN ELIJAH MOVED IN ELISHA
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; BUT IN A double portion
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; WITH A DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATION.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; And where men and women and everybody in
[1:56:07] between have made mistakes through the
[1:56:09] years. IT'S THINKING THAT GOD HAS TO
[1:56:12] MOVE ON YOU JUST like he moves on
[1:56:14] somebody else.
[1:56:15] &gt;&gt; Or you HAVE TO EXPERIENCE IT IN THE SAME
[1:56:18] WAY THAT SOMEONE ELSE EXPERIENCES IT.
[1:56:21] BUT I DON'T STRUGGLE WITH THAT BECAUSE
[1:56:23] OF MY BIG MAMA,
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; because of Haven's Carter. Because God
[1:56:28] showed her and she showed me, taught me.
[1:56:30] One gets it in that quiet little
[1:56:33] reverential reverence way, sweet way,
[1:56:36] her face glowing, and some get it like
[1:56:38] bulls in China closets. But it's the
[1:56:41] same Holy Ghost. It's the same spirit of
[1:56:44] the Lord.
[1:56:46] I like how everybody talks about how
[1:56:48] humble brother Brandham was when he came
[1:56:50] out to the pool pit. You know, he was he
[1:56:53] was just so meek and mild and and good
[1:56:56] evening friends.
[1:56:59] His head tilted to one side, one
[1:57:01] shoulder raised a little higher than the
[1:57:03] other, and people would say the spirit
[1:57:05] of the Lord. You could feel the
[1:57:07] atmosphere shift. But I want you to
[1:57:09] know, he didn't maintain that tone
[1:57:10] throughout the entire sermon.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. He didn't stay in that posture the
[1:57:15] whole time he preached.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; That's how he broke the ice. THAT'S HOW
[1:57:20] HE PUSHED the darkness back. But
[1:57:22] brother, when he was preaching on
[1:57:23] Jezebel religion,
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE WAS TALKING ABOUT A BACKSLID
[1:57:27] church laying her head in the lap of
[1:57:28] Delilah,
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; SAME ANOINTING SAID good evening
[1:57:32] friends.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; SAID YOU BOBBEDHAIRED WOMEN CALL
[1:57:38] YOURSELF CHRISTIANS. SAME ANOINTING.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SAME GIFT OF GOD IN HIS LIFE
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; but a different administration.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; That's why I had a long argument with
[1:57:49] someone, great discussion. It sort of
[1:57:51] ended up kind of in an argument. That's
[1:57:54] what happens when two hard-headed people
[1:57:55] try to come to to agreement sometimes
[1:57:59] and it was over brother Ben Brandon
[1:58:01] being angry. And I said, "No, he wasn't
[1:58:02] angry. I mean, he was capable of being
[1:58:05] angry. There are times he was. There are
[1:58:08] things that made him angry. There are
[1:58:09] things that made Jesus angry. That's
[1:58:12] right.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; But just because he raised his voice and
[1:58:16] his words got a little sharper as they
[1:58:18] went forth, it doesn't necessarily mean
[1:58:21] he was angry.
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; The gospels describe it as the zeal of
[1:58:24] the Lord's house. It was a fulfillment
[1:58:26] of Old Testament prophecy. The zeal of
[1:58:28] the Lord's house had overtaken him. It
[1:58:30] caused him to change the way he appro
[1:58:33] approached something. the truth the
[1:58:35] same, the the the the word, the message,
[1:58:38] the of truth the same, the anointing the
[1:58:40] same, but the administration changing a
[1:58:42] little bit because it's time.
[1:58:46] There is a one age, so to speak, is
[1:58:50] coming to an end and another
[1:58:53] manifestation, another administration of
[1:58:55] what God wants to do in the end time is
[1:58:58] coming forward. And that's really in so
[1:59:00] many ways where we are because he
[1:59:03] preaches to us about a bride age.
[1:59:06] And he preaches to us about the last
[1:59:08] church age being the Leodysian church
[1:59:11] age. Well, now if I can add properly, if
[1:59:15] you add something to the seventh church
[1:59:17] age, what do you get? You get an a
[1:59:20] eighth age. AND HE HIMSELF PREACHED
[1:59:23] against eighth age.
[1:59:26] He said, ' If there's another one,
[1:59:28] that's the millennium.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; And yet, you would hear him talking
[1:59:33] about coming into that bride age.
[1:59:36] And so, we understand then by watching
[1:59:38] it carefully, looking at it carefully
[1:59:40] through the scripture that at the end of
[1:59:43] Leodysia,
[1:59:45] LEODYSIA IS STILL on for the church.
[1:59:49] Yes, sir. But at the end of Leodysia,
[1:59:52] there is another age breaking forth to a
[1:59:56] people
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; that were elected.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; CHOSEN BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the
[2:00:03] world.
[2:00:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "IS THAT ELITISM?" I
[2:00:06] DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO CALL IT, BUT
[2:00:08] THE APOSTLE CALL PAUL CALLED IT
[2:00:10] ELECTION.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; YOU YOU CAN CALL IT WHATEVER YOU WANT TO
[2:00:16] CALL IT. THE THE THE CULT HUNTERS AND
[2:00:18] THE CRITICS out there will say all kinds
[2:00:21] of things about the gospel that brother
[2:00:23] Brandon was preaching. BUT IF THAT'S
[2:00:24] ELITISM, I I don't know. I I don't know
[2:00:26] what to say. Some people carry it so far
[2:00:29] that it becomes bride pride. I know
[2:00:31] that. BUT IT'S NOT PRIDEFUL TO
[2:00:33] UNDERSTAND THAT WHILE THE CHURCH IS
[2:00:36] DROWNING IN THE LAST HOURS OF LEODYSIA,
[2:00:40] THERE HAS TO BE A BRIDE. PEOPLE THAT
[2:00:42] START STEPPING HIGHER.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; SO, IS IT LEODYSIA OR IS IT BRIDE AGE?
[2:00:48] WELL, IT DEPENDS on who you're asking
[2:00:51] BECAUSE THERE COMES A TIME THAT WE
[2:00:53] RECOGNIZE THAT SOME ARE STILL IN THE
[2:00:56] CLUTCHES OF LEODYSIA WHILE others are
[2:00:59] beginning. There'll be forerunners,
[2:01:01] won't there?
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; There'll be forerunners, won't there?
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; There'll be arrowheads,
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; that have to go ahead to clear the way.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; There always has been. There always will
[2:01:12] be those. That's a remnant. It's a
[2:01:14] remnant. And in the story of Samson,
[2:01:16] I'll go right ahead and tell you, in the
[2:01:18] story of Samson, the remnant is
[2:01:20] represented in in typology as the lad.
[2:01:25] That little boy represents a remnant,
[2:01:30] RAISED AND CALLED OF GOD TO BE
[2:01:34] CONSECRATED.
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; FROM THE TIME OF THEIR spiritual birth,
[2:01:38] they become Nazerites unto the Lord. Not
[2:01:41] in the sense of defiling by the dead or
[2:01:44] drinking of the wine or eating of the
[2:01:46] raisin, but in a sense of being set
[2:01:48] apart. A and God can do what he wants to
[2:01:50] do.
[2:01:52] &gt;&gt; He provided a general. He provided a
[2:01:55] hero like Samson. But he also provided
[2:01:58] that little boy, a remnant. And and what
[2:02:00] purpose? What purpose did that little
[2:02:02] boy become? He became eyes.
[2:02:08] &gt;&gt; He became eyes. He could see what Samson
[2:02:10] couldn't see.
[2:02:13] Brother Brandham said that Samson
[2:02:15] represented a backslid church,
[2:02:18] compromised, cold, indifferent church.
[2:02:21] What had once known the fire, had once
[2:02:23] known the spirit of the Lord, had once
[2:02:25] known what it felt like to have your
[2:02:26] field set on fire.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Now she had burned over. The fire had
[2:02:32] gone out and she was frigid and cold.
[2:02:35] She couldn't see. It's Leodysia. It's a
[2:02:39] description of Leodysa. Cold and blind.
[2:02:42] And you know, she thinks she's rich,
[2:02:44] increased with goods. She's really
[2:02:46] naked.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; SHE HAS NO CLOTHES TO COVER HER
[2:02:50] NAKEDNESS BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT
[2:02:52] COULD COVER THE NAKEDNESS OF LEODYSIA IS
[2:02:55] THE REVEALED WORD OF THE HOUR. AMEN.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; AND IN THE ABSENCE OF THE REVEALED WORD
[2:03:00] OF THE HOUR, THE CHURCH STANDS BEFORE
[2:03:03] GOD TODAY NAKED
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; WITH NOTHING TO COVER her nakedness.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; But there's a bride simultaneously while
[2:03:13] the church is under the throws of
[2:03:15] Leodysia. There's a little bride. Uh
[2:03:17] she's getting something to cover her her
[2:03:20] uh neakedness with her her molds, her
[2:03:23] freckles, her come on.
[2:03:26] all of her and it's coming layer by
[2:03:30] layer. It's not all at one time. It's
[2:03:33] being made real to her. Even though the
[2:03:35] word has been opened and it's been
[2:03:36] revealed and the message has come, it
[2:03:39] doesn't dawn on us all at once. It
[2:03:42] doesn't take a hold of us all at once.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; It takes a hold of us how gradually
[2:03:49] gradually gradually. SUDDENLY,
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; I GOT IT. MY EYES ARE OPEN. NO WONDER
[2:03:55] THEY SAID EUREKA BECAUSE THEY'D had an
[2:03:57] epiphany.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; And that's WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IN THIS
[2:04:01] BRIDE AROUND the world. SHE MUST HAVE A
[2:04:05] WAKING UP.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; AND GOD WILL USE A FORERUNNING REMNANT
[2:04:10] REPRESENTED BY THAT LITTLE LAD WHO WILL
[2:04:13] TAKE THE HAND OF A BACKSLID BRIDAL
[2:04:15] [screaming] CHURCH.
[2:04:18] AMEN. IF SHE'S WILLING
[2:04:20] &gt;&gt; AND BECOME EYES TO SEE WHAT she cannot
[2:04:25] see.
[2:04:26] &gt;&gt; So how important is the remnant?
[2:04:29] How important are those who are willing
[2:04:32] to say boldly say that every word that
[2:04:36] brother Brandham said on those tapes is
[2:04:38] not thus sayaeth the Lord.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; You see there's a bridal church who can
[2:04:44] only see that. It's all thus sayith the
[2:04:47] lord. Even when he said uh Jesus the
[2:04:51] second person of the trinity and even
[2:04:53] after 63 when he said and the holy ghost
[2:04:56] the third person of the trinity he said
[2:04:59] why that's what he is. That's wrong.
[2:05:02] He's not that. And brother Brandham knew
[2:05:04] he was not that.
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; So for you to say that everything he
[2:05:10] said about the Holy Ghost even is thus
[2:05:12] sayeth the Lord, you'd be wrong. You're
[2:05:15] not dishonoring that man.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; You're letting him be what he was, a
[2:05:21] yielded vessel.
[2:05:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; Who could MAKE A MISSTEP. HE COULD he
[2:05:29] could uh use the wrong word DESCRIBING
[2:05:32] SOMETHING. HE could say 700 AND 7,000
[2:05:37] AND 700. There's so many things. But we
[2:05:42] didn't know back then what we know now.
[2:05:44] They were hanging on it every word, thus
[2:05:46] sayeth the Lord. Because they were
[2:05:48] building this cult,
[2:05:50] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:05:53] &gt;&gt; This tape cult.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; It's a cult.
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; It's what they're building.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; Every word, thus say the Lord, it's all
[2:06:05] Oh my. It's God veiled in flesh. It's
[2:06:09] his on and on. They go on and on and on.
[2:06:11] I I asked a brother recently. I said,
[2:06:14] "Why is it necessary to to to have
[2:06:17] brother Brandham appear 13 times in the
[2:06:20] book of the Revelation?
[2:06:23] WHY DOES HE HAVE TO BE ALL OF THEM,
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; RIGHT?
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; WHY IS IT NOT ENOUGH FOR HIM TO BE ONE
[2:06:28] OF THEM? WHY DID HE HAVE TO BE THE ANGEL
[2:06:32] IN THE SUN? WHY DOES HE HAVE TO BE THE
[2:06:35] ONE WHO JOHN BOWED TO? WHY DOES HE HAVE
[2:06:38] TO BE THIS ONE OR THAT ONE OR THE OTHER
[2:06:40] ONE? WHY DON'T WE JUST LET HIM DO AND
[2:06:43] FINISH the job AS HE HAS THAT GOD SENT
[2:06:46] HIM TO FINISH AND LOVE him as he told us
[2:06:48] to love him, OUR PRECIOUS BROTHER, BUT
[2:06:51] NOT TRY TO MAKE HIM MORE THAN a man.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Because if you do, you leave no room for
[2:06:57] the bride.
[2:06:58] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE'RE STILL STUMBLING WITH
[2:07:01] MISTAKES AND WE'RE STILL BLUNDERING AT
[2:07:04] TIMES AND WE STILL MISSPEAK AT TIMES. IF
[2:07:09] JESUS COULD BE OUR EXAMPLE, then brother
[2:07:12] Brandham must also be our example. And
[2:07:14] in order for us to understand his
[2:07:16] position, we have to let him be a man.
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; And that's why he kept saying, "The
[2:07:21] world is yet to see
[2:07:26] what what can happen if one man is
[2:07:30] yielded completely to the Lord."
[2:07:34] You may not be aware, and I hope you're
[2:07:35] not, of some of the things I'm even
[2:07:37] referring to, but I can tell you the
[2:07:40] spirit gets stronger week by week by
[2:07:43] week.
[2:07:45] So strong that in the last two weeks
[2:07:47] from headquarters, they've sent out this
[2:07:49] message to say that only the tapes, by
[2:07:54] the tapes and tapes only, can the bride
[2:07:57] even be changed.
[2:08:00] Oh, let me tell you something. The
[2:08:03] quickening power doesn't live on
[2:08:06] magnetic tape.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; The truth of the quickening power is on
[2:08:11] magnetic tape. But the quickening power
[2:08:14] doesn't live. Brother Brandham said God
[2:08:16] does not ordain machines.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; it's you you say it doesn't really
[2:08:22] matter. It's It is going to matter.
[2:08:23] YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT IT MATTERS.
[2:08:26] YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THAT IT MATTERS
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; JUST AROUND THE CORNER THERE. YOU'LL SEE
[2:08:31] THAT IT matters because God is
[2:08:35] preserving even now around the world a
[2:08:38] remnant
[2:08:39] &gt;&gt; who can see what Samson is no longer
[2:08:41] able to see.
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; And she will be necessary. That little
[2:08:47] remnant will be necessary to help Samson
[2:08:49] get back in position.
[2:08:52] Somebody said, "I don't even believe it
[2:08:53] says that." OH, HE SAW IT. Get in step,
[2:08:58] [screaming]
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; little bride.
[2:09:03] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, that had to be
[2:09:04] brother Brandon's voice to call the
[2:09:05] bride back in step." Please, is it his
[2:09:08] voice or God's voice?
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; If it's his voice, HE'S NO LONGER AROUND
[2:09:12] TO DO IT. IF IT'S GOD'S VOICE, HE SAID
[2:09:15] THE FINAL VOICE OF GOD TO THE AGE WILL
[2:09:19] NOT BE. HE DIDN'T SAY IT WOULD BE IN THE
[2:09:21] SEVENTH AGE PROPHET. HE SAID IT WOULD BE
[2:09:24] WHERE? IN the
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; in THE BRIDE.
[2:09:27] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT trying to usurp or take anyone
[2:09:30] else's place or to bring someone else
[2:09:33] down or to point out someone's humanity
[2:09:37] over and over and smear it around. But
[2:09:40] what we're trying to understand is there
[2:09:43] is a scriptural way to see what's
[2:09:46] happening in this hour.
[2:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if the devil can cause you to
[2:09:50] cling to erroneous doctrine of
[2:09:53] denominationalism, he will. But if he
[2:09:56] can cause you to be blindsided
[2:10:00] &gt;&gt; by the error
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; around the message
[2:10:05] &gt;&gt; so that your focus is on a man
[2:10:09] instead of the stature of the perfect
[2:10:13] man.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Your focus shouldn't be on your pastor.
[2:10:18] right?
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Your favorite preacher.
[2:10:22] Because if you listen to the ones I
[2:10:24] listen to, they're all saying the same
[2:10:26] thing these days over and over and over
[2:10:29] and over and over and over again.
[2:10:33] They're more excited now about the cloud
[2:10:35] than they've ever been in their entire
[2:10:37] life.
[2:10:40] And they beat it like a mule. They beat
[2:10:43] it and beat it and beat it and dance
[2:10:45] about it and shout about it, sing about
[2:10:47] it. And it's like brother Brandham said
[2:10:50] to us when that spirit of the Lord came
[2:10:53] down during the time of the church ages
[2:10:56] and the pillar of fire came and hung in
[2:10:59] the tabernacle there and uh put on the
[2:11:02] wall the images that brother Brandham
[2:11:05] had drawn on the board of the waning
[2:11:07] moon. Do you know what I'm talking
[2:11:08] about?
[2:11:09] the the the eclipses of the moon, the
[2:11:12] waning of the moon and the pillar of
[2:11:14] fire come and hung over the congregation
[2:11:16] and took that that he had written there
[2:11:19] on the board and reflected it on the
[2:11:21] back wall
[2:11:23] for everyone to see the confirmation and
[2:11:26] people screamed. You can hear it. They
[2:11:28] screamed. And what did brother Brandham
[2:11:30] DO? HE SAID, "THERE'S TWO OF THEM.
[2:11:35] One is the real and one is the
[2:11:38] reflection.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; And he said, "What you're looking at
[2:11:44] is the reflection."
[2:11:46] The real one is there.
[2:11:49] The whole crowd had been captured by the
[2:11:53] reflection.
[2:11:55] And let me ask you a question. Is the
[2:11:57] reflection greater than that which has
[2:11:59] reflected? Absolutely not. IT'D BE LIKE
[2:12:02] SAYING THE MOON IS GREATER THAN THE SUN.
[2:12:05] The moon is a lesser light
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; REFLECTING THE LIGHT OF THE SUN. THAT'S
[2:12:10] WHAT A PROPHET MESSENGER HAS TO DO.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; HE WOULD BE A LESSER LIGHT.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; REFLECTING THE GREATER LIGHT
[2:12:17] &gt;&gt; of the son of man.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; A SON OF MAN PROPHET REVEALING the son
[2:12:23] of man, the Lord Jesus Christ. COME ON.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; THEN WHAT WOULD THE BRIDE BE? HE called
[2:12:28] the bride a moon. THEN WHAT MUST WE
[2:12:30] REFLECT? LIGHT,
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; not not moon moonshine,
[2:12:36] [laughter]
[2:12:38] &gt;&gt; SUNSHINE,
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; THEN WE ARE A LESSER LIGHT OF THE SUN.
[2:12:42] AND THAT MEANS WE REFLECT ONLY
[2:12:45] the sunlight,
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; that little bride. Oh, you watch her.
[2:12:51] You watch her. She's going to find her
[2:12:54] way.
[2:12:56] &gt;&gt; She's going to find her way. And the
[2:12:57] remnant will help point her there.
[2:12:59] Absolutely. Not the son of a prophet.
[2:13:03] The son of the prophet is a distraction.
[2:13:08] You have Africans posting all over
[2:13:10] social media that that Joseph Branom has
[2:13:14] has now taken the place.
[2:13:17] Are you kidding me?
[2:13:20] You you mean the young man who was on a
[2:13:22] motorcycle with his long hair and his
[2:13:24] cigarette packed roped wrapped up in his
[2:13:26] uh t-shirt when when they were hearing
[2:13:29] the last sermons of brother Brandham
[2:13:31] after his death in the high school.
[2:13:33] Joseph was out serving sin. So was
[2:13:35] brother Brandham before the Lord called
[2:13:37] him in. I'm not disqualifying him for
[2:13:39] that. But I'm saying when he had an
[2:13:41] opportunity as a boy to be humble and
[2:13:44] soft and prepare himself for whatever it
[2:13:46] was that God was going to call him to
[2:13:48] do, instead he was running in the other
[2:13:50] direction. I have no doubt in my mind
[2:13:52] that the Lord has raised him up to lead
[2:13:54] the the the the furtherance of getting
[2:13:57] the message to the people. But a seventh
[2:14:00] church age messenger doesn't have a
[2:14:02] successor.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; If brother Brandham tells us there's not
[2:14:05] an eighth messenger,
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; he tells us there WILL NOT BE AN EIGHTH
[2:14:08] MESSENGER. AMEN.
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; DOESN'T MATTER WHO HE IS. NOT LEE,
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; not Brian Kokeric OR HOWEVER YOU SAY IT
[2:14:15] OR ANY OF THE REST.
[2:14:18] &gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO. HE DOESN'T NEED AN EIGHTH
[2:14:20] MESSENGER. HE NEEDS A LESSER LIGHT
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; TO REFLECT THE SUNSHINE. AND HE
[2:14:26] IDENTIFIED HER AS A MANY MEMBERED BRIDE,
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; A BODY OF MANY PARTS, BUT MOVING
[2:14:34] TOGETHER IN SYNCHRONIZATION,
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; IN DIVINE ORDER
[2:14:40] &gt;&gt; to get the job done,
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; not pointing us to one. That little lad
[2:14:48] was one, but he represents a remnant of
[2:14:51] people who said, "Come here, strong
[2:14:53] man."
[2:14:55] I remember I remember the stories.
[2:14:58] Let me help you get back to where you
[2:15:01] need to go. Let me be your eyes. I can't
[2:15:04] do I can't that remnant cannot do what
[2:15:08] what the bridegroom is to do.
[2:15:11] We can't do anything except what the
[2:15:14] Lord would let the remnant do.
[2:15:16] He said, "I can't, you know, in his
[2:15:18] mind, I I can uh finish your job,
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; but I can help you get to where you need
[2:15:24] to be
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; so that you can finish your job." We
[2:15:27] don't hear that little boy trying to
[2:15:28] push against the pillars. He just tried
[2:15:30] to get Samson back. I'll show you. I'll
[2:15:32] show it to you. If you're struggling
[2:15:34] with it, hold on. Give me a few more
[2:15:36] weeks. Laying a foundation.
[2:15:38] But he had a purpose. Even brother
[2:15:40] Brandon tells us he had a purpose. He
[2:15:42] Samson was born for a purpose. That
[2:15:43] little lad was born for a purpose.
[2:15:45] wasn't the same purpose,
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; but both will bring glory to God.
[2:15:49] &gt;&gt; And it's not one little lad. It's one
[2:15:51] little lad and symbol. But it's that
[2:15:53] little bride that many who will call for
[2:15:56] the resurrection, the final voice of God
[2:15:58] to the ages.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; She'll have thus sayeth the Lord or
[2:16:01] she'll keep still.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Yeah, you're just always
[2:16:06] pushing that off, folks." That's the
[2:16:07] reality of it.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; It's it's one more hill, one more
[2:16:11] valley, one more curve.
[2:16:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THAT SU
[2:16:16] THAT GRADUALLY IS GOING TO BECOME THE
[2:16:18] SUDDENLY.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; But I don't THINK I'D BE WRONG TO TELL
[2:16:22] YOU IT COULD BE BEFORE the end of the
[2:16:23] year. It could be in THE NEXT YEAR
[2:16:25] THAT'S COMING. WE DON'T KNOW.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; But the bride's revival that they claim
[2:16:31] they've been in for 40 years has not yet
[2:16:34] struck the bride.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; Because when it does,
[2:16:38] &gt;&gt; she'll get in place.
[2:16:41] &gt;&gt; She'll pull the whole thing down. Yes.
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, that means her
[2:16:45] death." No, it means her translation.
[2:16:50] &gt;&gt; When California goes down,
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; something goes up.
[2:16:57] &gt;&gt; Is that right? I think I think it's
[2:16:59] right.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; So, this spirit of the Lord, what time
[2:17:02] is it? 116. This spirit of the Lord that
[2:17:05] moved mightily
[2:17:07] means to burst forth, to break out, to
[2:17:09] push forward, to advance forcefully, to
[2:17:11] succeed by sudden power. This is not a
[2:17:15] gentle descent of a dove. It's like a
[2:17:18] rushing, erupting, explosive
[2:17:21] empowerment.
[2:17:23] Now, here's what you need to know about
[2:17:25] Samson in closing. And and and and did
[2:17:28] the Bible say that that child would be
[2:17:30] the beginning of deliverance for Israel?
[2:17:34] This is the beginning of the closing.
[2:17:37] [clears throat]
[2:17:39] The deliverance is not coming all at one
[2:17:41] time. Neither's the closing.
[2:17:47] Oh, when I said that, I can see Kad and
[2:17:49] Jenna, can't you? In the There's my
[2:17:52] little doohickey fell off again. Uh, I
[2:17:55] can see them in the skit. I've watched
[2:17:58] it again and it is still extremely
[2:18:01] funny. We're going to have to have some
[2:18:03] of those manuals printed up to give
[2:18:05] visitors to get them ready for how we do
[2:18:08] things around here. All right. The
[2:18:10] sages,
[2:18:12] and brother Brandham refers to the
[2:18:14] Jewish elders at times, not all are
[2:18:16] Pharisees.
[2:18:19] They studied and they learned and they
[2:18:22] wrote and they passed down
[2:18:25] both truth and tradition.
[2:18:27] It takes the Holy Spirit of God to be
[2:18:30] able to discern between truth and
[2:18:31] tradition in Jewish uh writings. And it
[2:18:35] takes the Holy Spirit to be able to
[2:18:37] discern between truth and tradition in
[2:18:39] the message because there's some things
[2:18:42] that people practice in the message
[2:18:44] around the message that aren't
[2:18:45] scriptural at all. They're just
[2:18:47] traditional. And and and God doesn't
[2:18:50] hate tradition. If you think he does,
[2:18:52] you've misunderstood him.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; But what he does despise is when
[2:18:55] tradition begins to negate the promise.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; When tradition keeps people from
[2:19:00] receiving the promise, you better change
[2:19:02] your tradition.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; And catch up with the promise.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. The sages interpretation of Samson
[2:19:11] is a little bit different than what your
[2:19:13] Baptist Sunday school showed you about
[2:19:15] Samson. When you see a picture of Samson
[2:19:18] in a Bible story book, he looks like the
[2:19:20] Tony Atlas I was talking about. You
[2:19:22] know, he's standing there with his
[2:19:25] golden muscles rippling, shining in the
[2:19:29] sun. He looks like the biggest tank
[2:19:32] that's ever walked the face of the
[2:19:34] planet. But Jewish tradition and
[2:19:38] teaching says
[2:19:40] he was certainly not that.
[2:19:42] And if he was, the question is asked
[2:19:45] then why would in Judges 16:E5
[2:19:50] why would the Philistines have to have
[2:19:52] kept asking the question wherein his
[2:19:56] great strength lith?
[2:19:59] They keep saying we need you to find out
[2:20:03] Delilah. We need you to find out what is
[2:20:05] the source of his great strength. Now,
[2:20:08] if he had all those big muscles and he
[2:20:10] looked like the strongest man that ever
[2:20:12] lived on the planet,
[2:20:14] then they wouldn't have had to keep
[2:20:16] asking Delila. They would have said, "Oh
[2:20:18] my goodness, he can bench press all of
[2:20:21] all the Philistines at one time. Look at
[2:20:24] him. He's a tank moving across the
[2:20:26] road."
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; But Brother Brandham calls him a
[2:20:31] looking fellow.
[2:20:36] Brother Brandham said he probably had a
[2:20:37] hairbo.
[2:20:40] [clears throat]
[2:20:45] He uses the word multiple times
[2:20:48] when trying to describe the ordinary
[2:20:50] look of Samson.
[2:20:57] It's interesting to me because what that
[2:21:00] means is the source of his strength had
[2:21:03] nothing to do with his muscles
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham does refer to
[2:21:07] Samson later in the story as having
[2:21:10] muscles.
[2:21:12] By the time he pulled the pillars down,
[2:21:14] brother Brandham is again referring to
[2:21:16] muscles.
[2:21:19] But in the beginning,
[2:21:22] he's letting us know that the source of
[2:21:24] Samson's great strength does not lie in
[2:21:28] his gym membership.
[2:21:34] Not in his preworkout or his creatine
[2:21:38] or his
[2:21:40] supplements or his testosterone boosters
[2:21:45] or his metabolism boosters or any of the
[2:21:48] other drugs that people uh get excited
[2:21:51] about.
[2:21:53] It was only
[2:21:56] in the spirit of the Lord that didn't
[2:21:59] trickle down on him. It moved mightily
[2:22:03] upon him, impelling, propelling him to
[2:22:07] be obedient to God. Powerful. The sages
[2:22:11] say, you can find this in the Midash.
[2:22:14] You can find this in the Targums.
[2:22:16] And for those of you that haven't heard
[2:22:18] explanation about the Targums, I'll do
[2:22:20] it very quickly. The Targums are ancient
[2:22:23] writings that were originally written in
[2:22:25] Aramaic, which was the language that was
[2:22:27] spoken predominantly in the time of the
[2:22:30] Lord Jesus. Yes, there were people still
[2:22:33] speaking Hebrew, but not as many as you
[2:22:36] would think because the Jews had been
[2:22:39] assimilating through the years. They had
[2:22:42] been under the Babylonian influence.
[2:22:43] They had been under the Philistine
[2:22:45] influence. They had been under the
[2:22:47] Assyrian influence. They had been under
[2:22:48] the influence of the Greeks. Now they
[2:22:51] were feeling the impression and the and
[2:22:54] the oppression of the Romans and so they
[2:22:57] began to speak a mixture of languages
[2:23:01] referred to as Aramaic. And so what what
[2:23:04] the Targums were is they were writings
[2:23:08] ancient documents that were written in
[2:23:09] the time of Christ in Aramaic.
[2:23:14] And what these documents do is they help
[2:23:18] us to see what was being taught
[2:23:22] at the time of the second temple or
[2:23:26] during the ministry life, the life
[2:23:28] ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ. It's
[2:23:31] actually very interesting uh to look at
[2:23:33] on occasion because it helps people to
[2:23:36] understand. For instance, we realize
[2:23:39] from looking at the Targums and I've
[2:23:41] told you this before that the Jews did
[2:23:44] not believe that their Messiah was going
[2:23:47] to be a holy man
[2:23:50] like God or the son of God or powerful
[2:23:55] like God or or spiritual like God. They
[2:23:59] certainly didn't believe in the time of
[2:24:01] the second temple period that he was
[2:24:02] going to be God. So for Jesus to say to
[2:24:06] people in the second temple period, when
[2:24:08] you've seen me, you've seen the father,
[2:24:11] the poor people in the synagogue were
[2:24:14] not being told that when Messiah came,
[2:24:16] he was going to be
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; like the father or the father. And so
[2:24:22] they were they were they they were blown
[2:24:25] away because what what I'm saying is the
[2:24:27] teaching of the people had become so
[2:24:29] watered down, so compromised, so mixed
[2:24:32] that they weren't even teaching the
[2:24:33] entirety of the Old Testament.
[2:24:36] And so the Targum sometimes helps us to
[2:24:38] understand that people weren't they were
[2:24:41] looking for a military general.
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; They were looking for a powerful messiah
[2:24:45] who would lead an army in revolt
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; against Rome.
[2:24:49] They weren't looking for a sandalwearing
[2:24:53] uh blind eyeopening,
[2:24:55] LEPROSY CLEANSING SEA WALKER.
[2:25:00] They were looking for a general who
[2:25:02] would rally the Jewish armies and those
[2:25:05] bands of revolters and bring them back
[2:25:08] and they would stand united against
[2:25:10] Rome. And so for it if you if you
[2:25:14] understand that it makes everything
[2:25:17] richer because then you get the
[2:25:19] scripture we talked about the other day.
[2:25:20] He stands up in the temple uh on the
[2:25:24] particular day that Isaiah's prophecy of
[2:25:26] Messiah's ministry is going to be read.
[2:25:29] And he gets up and reads the spirit of
[2:25:31] the Lord is upon me because he hath
[2:25:32] anointed me to preach. And then he goes
[2:25:35] and sits down and says this day this
[2:25:38] scripture is fulfilled in your ears. And
[2:25:40] they go, "What?
[2:25:45] This is what the Messiah is supposed to
[2:25:47] be? The spirit of the He's supposed to
[2:25:49] preach. He's supposed to set captives
[2:25:50] free and give sight to the blind and
[2:25:52] open prison doors.
[2:25:55] So, he's spiritual.
[2:25:57] We thought he was mighty. Isn't this
[2:25:59] Joseph's son from Nazareth? Who Who is
[2:26:02] this guy? He knows better than the
[2:26:05] sages. He knows better than the Tamud.
[2:26:08] Can you imagine?
[2:26:10] And he did
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; because the word made flesh was standing
[2:26:14] before them.
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; No wonder he said it. But when you look
[2:26:17] at the Targums, it helps you to
[2:26:18] understand that in many ply many ways
[2:26:21] the people were just, you know, because
[2:26:24] they'd been hearing it for 700 plus
[2:26:26] years. He's coming. He's coming. He's
[2:26:28] coming. He's coming. He's coming. He's
[2:26:29] coming. And only a few little virgins
[2:26:32] kept knitting booties, believing.
[2:26:34] Brother Bram tells us, believing that
[2:26:36] Messiah was going to come.
[2:26:38] But but the church at large, we could
[2:26:40] say the Jewish community at large, they
[2:26:42] give up on the idea of of a of a holy
[2:26:44] man. And this is just going to be a
[2:26:46] general. The only hope we have is for
[2:26:48] somebody to come and drive the Romans
[2:26:50] out. my did they get more than they
[2:26:51] bargained for
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; because the destruction of the temple
[2:26:57] and some of the greatest destruction by
[2:27:00] the Romans took place after the ministry
[2:27:04] of the Messiah
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; after he had already gone into heaven
[2:27:07] and then the temple destroyed and
[2:27:10] they're thinking, "Oh my goodness, we
[2:27:12] thought things would get better." So
[2:27:13] even believers
[2:27:15] began to question. We thought things
[2:27:17] would get better WHEN THE MESSIAH CAME
[2:27:19] AND NOW THE TEMPLE IS GONE.
[2:27:22] &gt;&gt; BUT ALL OF IT IN GOD'S PLAN BECAUSE he
[2:27:25] wanted them to know, I don't want to
[2:27:27] live forever
[2:27:30] &gt;&gt; and a house of stone.
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; He wanted them to know, I WANT TO LIVE.
[2:27:35] I'VE GOT A BETTER WAY FOR YOU. I want to
[2:27:37] live IN YOU.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO LIVE ABOVE YOU ANYMORE.
[2:27:40] I DON'T JUST WANT TO LIVE WITH YOU
[2:27:42] ANYMORE. I WANT TO LIVE IN YOU. Isn't it
[2:27:45] powerful when you see it?
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; So many of these writings that are
[2:27:49] preserved from second temple period and
[2:27:52] beyond will tell you that that Samson
[2:27:54] was not unusually muscular, that his
[2:27:57] appearance did not explain his strength,
[2:28:00] that his strength came directly from the
[2:28:03] spirit of God. And that is why the
[2:28:06] Philistines constantly ask wherein his
[2:28:09] great strength lith. Judges 16:5. WHY?
[2:28:14] BECAUSE IF SAMSON LOOKED LIKE A GIANT
[2:28:16] BODYBUILDER, the Philistines would not
[2:28:18] have needed to even ask the question.
[2:28:21] Their curiosity itself supports the
[2:28:24] ancient view that he appeared normal,
[2:28:27] ordinary,
[2:28:29] maybe even unimpressive.
[2:28:32] Am I messing with your songs? Am
[2:28:35] [clears throat] I upset in your Bible
[2:28:36] stories?
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; A am I am am am am am am am am am am am
[2:28:39] am am am am am am am am am am am am am
[2:28:39] am am am am am am am am am am am am am
[2:28:39] am am am am am I uh contradicting the
[2:28:41] the books we read to our children and
[2:28:42] the pictures that we show?" Samson might
[2:28:45] have been wormy.
[2:28:49] He didn't need the gym membership. The
[2:28:51] spirit of the Lord was moving mightily
[2:28:54] on him. I need a few more minutes.
[2:28:58] This is this is beautiful because it
[2:29:00] goes through scripture. He wasn't the
[2:29:02] only one. in 1st Samuel 16:13. I'm going
[2:29:05] to read it in the amplified quickly.
[2:29:06] Then Samuel took the horn of oil and
[2:29:09] anointed David in the midst of his
[2:29:11] brothers.
[2:29:12] And the spirit of the Lord came how?
[2:29:16] &gt;&gt; Same Hebrew word, rushing upon David
[2:29:20] from that day forward. And Samuel arose
[2:29:24] and went to Rama again. Mightily it
[2:29:28] overtook David.
[2:29:30] mightily it fell upon him. Powerful. And
[2:29:34] in 1st Samuel 11:6
[2:29:37] amplified again, the spirit of God came
[2:29:40] mightily upon who? Saul
[2:29:45] when he heard those tidings,
[2:29:48] and his anger was greatly kindled.
[2:29:53] What what what happened? The spirit of
[2:29:56] God overtook him and his anger was
[2:29:59] greatly kindled. You have to read the
[2:30:01] context to understand it. The spirit
[2:30:03] overpowered Elijah.
[2:30:06] The spirit made Elisha run ahead
[2:30:10] of Ahab's chariot. That's more than a
[2:30:13] trickle down feeling.
[2:30:14] &gt;&gt; A little bit of spirit, little
[2:30:16] inspiration. My hair I think my hair is
[2:30:18] standing up on my arm. Oh, no, no, no.
[2:30:21] This is a seizing. THIS IS GOD SAYING,
[2:30:24] "YOU'RE MINE, [screaming]
[2:30:25] AND I'M GOING TO USE YOU FOR MY GLORY.
[2:30:29] YOU WERE BORN FOR A PURPOSE. THE WOMB
[2:30:31] THAT GAVE YOU BIRTH WAS SANCTIFIED AND
[2:30:34] SET APART. AND FROM YOUR MOTHER'S WOMB,
[2:30:37] YOU WERE A NAZERITE. AND MIGHTILY, I'M
[2:30:40] GOING TO TAKE A hold of your life now
[2:30:41] and use you for my glory."
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Oh, I wish that could be
[2:30:46] me." then you're going to have to make
[2:30:49] the same consecrations.
[2:30:56] Very few at this moment are willing, but
[2:30:58] you just wait.
[2:31:01] There's an hour coming when when the
[2:31:04] when those who are unwilling now will be
[2:31:07] willing.
[2:31:09] &gt;&gt; You know, God's able to change your
[2:31:10] willingness. Right.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; He's able to bring circumstances upon us
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; so tight, so difficult, so unusual, so
[2:31:18] out of the ordinary
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; that we're desperate.
[2:31:22] &gt;&gt; We don't even lock the building. It's
[2:31:24] all night prayer meetings until somebody
[2:31:26] can break through and be filled with
[2:31:29] that kind of a power, a spirit of God
[2:31:31] that breaks forth. It'll make you pay
[2:31:33] more attention in church. It'll make you
[2:31:35] sleep less when you get here.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; Come on. It'll do all kinds of things
[2:31:38] for your life. It'll make you show up.
[2:31:43] Is that all right?
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; We're nearly done. I have a few little
[2:31:47] quotations I want to read to close this
[2:31:49] out. This is uh the middle part of the
[2:31:52] closing.
[2:31:55] This is in a sermon, a wedding supper.
[2:31:59] He said, "When that robe, paragraph 35,
[2:32:03] when that robe comes in there, when that
[2:32:06] robe comes in, there's a little hidden
[2:32:09] power
[2:32:12] that comes down in your heart that all
[2:32:16] devils in hell can't make you doubt it."
[2:32:19] &gt;&gt; Come on. that hidden power, NOT WITH A
[2:32:23] GREAT BIG something across your
[2:32:25] forehead.
[2:32:26] And a doctor of divinity wrote this way.
[2:32:30] It's an inside
[2:32:32] hidden power.
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:35] HE SAID, "IT'S BEEN GOD'S PROGRAM since
[2:32:38] the first lamb was slain in the Garden
[2:32:41] of Eden or outside the garden." Right?
[2:32:44] Samson had it.
[2:32:47] He had a HIDDEN POWER, A TOUCH OF THE
[2:32:49] HOLY GHOST.
[2:32:51] He said, "Now, a lot of people say
[2:32:53] Samson had shoulders like a barn door."
[2:32:57] He said, "Well, it wasn't." Well, some
[2:33:00] of these here artists that tries to
[2:33:01] paint his pictures that that would be no
[2:33:04] mystery to me to see a man with
[2:33:05] shoulders like barn doors to slay a lion
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; or to take up a gate and walk away with
[2:33:11] it. But Samson was just a little bitty
[2:33:16] mama's boy.
[2:33:18] A LITTLE CURLYHEADED UNCOSHER shrimp
[2:33:26] about like that. He said, "Now that's
[2:33:29] what fooled the people."
[2:33:32] AND HE WAS JUST AN ORDINARY BOY. HAD
[2:33:34] SEVEN LITTLE CURLS hanging down his
[2:33:36] back. Looked like a little THAT'S
[2:33:38] RIGHT. EVERYBODY WOULD LAUGH AT HIM. I
[2:33:41] don't doubt it. A TYPE OF THE HOLY GHOST
[2:33:44] CHURCH. HIS OWN CHURCH DIDN'T WANT
[2:33:46] ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; He was a weakling.
[2:33:53] BUT WHEN THE HOUR COME THAT GOD WANTED
[2:33:56] TO USE HIM,
[2:33:58] &gt;&gt; HELLO.
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; HE WAS A GIANT, BROTHER.
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; Now listen, listen carefully. God wants
[2:34:06] a church that he can lay his hands on.
[2:34:10] Amen.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; How many of you want to be a church? You
[2:34:15] want to be a person. You want to be an
[2:34:17] individual
[2:34:18] and A CORPORATE PEOPLE THAT GOD CAN LAY
[2:34:21] HIS hands on.
[2:34:23] &gt;&gt; Help us, Lord.
[2:34:25] &gt;&gt; JUST ONCE MORE, LORD.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, I don't I don't care how
[2:34:29] little it is. two or three gathered in
[2:34:31] my name.
[2:34:34] Not some show,
[2:34:39] some production, some performance.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; It's the anointing that destroys the
[2:34:45] yoke.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; It's not noise.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; It's the anointing. There are a lot of
[2:34:52] folks who can make a lot of noise, but
[2:34:54] they don't have the anointing that a
[2:34:56] housefly has.
[2:34:57] &gt;&gt; And so, it's just hollow. It just sounds
[2:35:00] so hollow. It means nothing. It shifts
[2:35:04] nothing. It changes nothing
[2:35:07] &gt;&gt; because it's a vacuum instead of a
[2:35:09] constant. Lord, send us an outpouring
[2:35:14] IN THE INSIDE OF THE INSIDE THAT WILL SO
[2:35:17] OCCUPY US, SO ARREST US, SO POSSESS US
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; that we can't get out of the way. And
[2:35:26] when I say out of the way, I mean we
[2:35:27] want to be out of your way, but not out
[2:35:29] of the way. God wants a church that he
[2:35:32] can lay his hands on. I don't care how
[2:35:34] little it is. Two or three gather in my
[2:35:35] name, I'll be there in the midst. Not
[2:35:37] just speak it. Then you say, "Well, we
[2:35:39] gather in his name. Speak in the name of
[2:35:42] Jesus by word." It's not what he meant.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; So much as it is the attitude,
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; the attitude that you're gathered in.
[2:35:57] Did you come today just because you are
[2:35:59] waiting for the last amen so that you
[2:36:01] can go out and brag and tell somebody
[2:36:02] standing out in the front of the church
[2:36:04] of all of your wonderful deeds this week
[2:36:06] or all the things that have happened to
[2:36:07] you? Did you come with an attitude to be
[2:36:10] seen?
[2:36:11] Did you come with an attitude to see
[2:36:13] somebody else,
[2:36:15] see who would be here, see who's
[2:36:18] responsible for this cough that goes
[2:36:20] around?
[2:36:22] Or did you come with an attitude that
[2:36:24] says, "Lord, I don't know what you're
[2:36:26] going to do, but I know it'll be good."
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; And I'm coming to get my cup full of it.
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "The motive that you come in,
[2:36:35] the attitude."
[2:36:38] He said, "AS IT IS THE ATTITUDE, YOU'RE
[2:36:39] GATHERED IN the environment of the name
[2:36:43] of Jesus."
[2:36:46] When you gather in my name, then ask
[2:36:48] what you will. It's the motive that you
[2:36:52] come in the attitude. It's an attitude
[2:36:56] instead of so much of a calling a name.
[2:37:00] Sinners call that name on the street
[2:37:04] cursed and everything else. But it's the
[2:37:07] environment that you're in, the attitude
[2:37:10] that you come coming in Jesus name. How
[2:37:14] many of you believe you understand that?
[2:37:16] And then in a in in a is that the same
[2:37:19] one? No, it's a in in paragraph 36.
[2:37:23] These are long paragraphs. That was one
[2:37:25] paragraph. He said, "I can see Samson.
[2:37:29] He was on his road to see his
[2:37:31] girlfriend.
[2:37:33] Little boy. His little mommy fixed
[2:37:35] his little curls up.
[2:37:40] Here he was going down to see his little
[2:37:42] girlfriend. AND A GREAT BIG LION RAN OUT
[2:37:45] AND ROARED AT HIM.
[2:37:49] He was helpless.
[2:37:51] You know, a sissy's helpless against a
[2:37:53] lion.
[2:37:55] The Bible said
[2:37:58] that the spirit of God came on him.
[2:38:03] It didn't say he had had enough protein
[2:38:06] until his muscles were pumping. You
[2:38:09] could see the blood running through the
[2:38:10] vessels. No, it says the spirit of God
[2:38:14] came upon him. And you you're going to
[2:38:18] you're going to figure it out if you
[2:38:19] haven't already. HOW IMPORTANT IT NOT BY
[2:38:23] MIGHT
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; NOR BY POWER,
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; BUT BY MY [screaming] SPIRIT,
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; MY BREATH, MY RUACH,
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; THE HOLY THE HA KODESH, THE HOLY ruach
[2:38:38] of God. His breath that changes more
[2:38:41] than a name.
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; HIS BREATH CHANGES CHARACTER.
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. His [clears throat] change HIS H
[2:38:50] HIS BREATH CAN CHANGE THE ATMOSPHERE.
[2:38:54] HIS BREATH CAN CHANGE MY ATTITUDE.
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:38:59] &gt;&gt; YOURS, TOO.
[2:39:00] &gt;&gt; You need it, too.
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; The Bible said the spirit of God came on
[2:39:05] him. HE GRABBED THAT LION. OH.
[2:39:09] ordinary little fellow, seven curls down
[2:39:12] his back, mama curled his hair for to go
[2:39:14] see his girlfriend.
[2:39:16] The these are just dramatizations,
[2:39:20] but I like them
[2:39:23] cuz I don't think I'll ever look like
[2:39:25] Schwarzenegger in his uh heyday.
[2:39:30] But God's not looking for that.
[2:39:36] He's looking for somebody that's willing
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; to be apprehended for his purposes. It's
[2:39:42] not something new. It's the reason you
[2:39:43] were born. It's just getting back to try
[2:39:46] to figure out why you were born. You
[2:39:48] were born for something. God doesn't
[2:39:50] make up your destiny. I don't understand
[2:39:52] this thought of destiny as though it's
[2:39:53] made up as you go along. We serve a
[2:39:56] sovereign God who knew the end from the
[2:39:58] beginning.
[2:39:59] &gt;&gt; Before your days were ever written in
[2:40:01] his book, he knew them all.
[2:40:03] Surely he didn't make it up as he went
[2:40:05] along. He had a destiny set for you. You
[2:40:08] fall off of it sometimes. You wander
[2:40:10] away from it. You marry the wrong
[2:40:12] person. You do something you have no
[2:40:13] business doing.
[2:40:16] You run after the almighty dollar.
[2:40:19] You get your eyes on that how successful
[2:40:22] you can be and how stupid you have to
[2:40:23] look to get there.
[2:40:26] And you miss the fact that you were born
[2:40:29] for something so much higher than that.
[2:40:31] But without the anointing,
[2:40:34] you better stick with your day job
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; because it's the anointing that breaks
[2:40:38] the yoke. It's the anointing that makes
[2:40:41] the difference because it's not a
[2:40:43] feeling. What is it? It's a person.
[2:40:46] &gt;&gt; You're moving out so he can move in.
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; Here come this lion. GRAB THAT LION LIKE
[2:40:52] IT WAS A LITTLE GOAT.
[2:40:57] The Brandon says later it weighed 500
[2:41:00] 600 lb. I got a feeling it might have
[2:41:02] weighed a little more than that even.
[2:41:06] That's not a little goat.
[2:41:10] That's a big That's a big creature.
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; And he just tore it like it was a goat.
[2:41:16] What a man he was. Listen.
[2:41:21] When the spirit of God came ON HIM,
[2:41:25] &gt;&gt; HE HAD A HIDDEN POWER, AMEN, THAT HAD
[2:41:28] BEEN GIVEN HIM. WELL, THAT SAME SPIRIT
[2:41:31] OF GOD IS THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY SPIRITS OF GOD ARE THERE? ONE.
[2:41:38] DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIONS, different
[2:41:40] governments, different ways of moving.
[2:41:43] Same Holy Ghost.
[2:41:44] &gt;&gt; He said it's a hidden power. Yes. and he
[2:41:47] slew the lion
[2:41:50] as if it would have been
[2:41:52] just a kid.
[2:41:54] Isn't that good?
[2:41:57] &gt;&gt; Read on. I don't think we're done with
[2:41:58] that one. How powerful he was.
[2:42:01] Not because he had brawn or brain.
[2:42:06] Because he had a hidden power. Now the
[2:42:08] man musicians are coming. That's always
[2:42:11] a better sign.
[2:42:13] Now, the man with this hidden power,
[2:42:15] IT'S NOT SO MUCH AS YOU WOULD COULDN'T
[2:42:17] OPERATE ON HIM AND find it.
[2:42:20] Brother Benham SAID YOU COULDN'T CUT HIM
[2:42:22] OPEN AND FIND where that little hidden
[2:42:24] power lays.
[2:42:27] The doctor might cut him in pieces, but
[2:42:29] he looked like an ordinary man.
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; And they wonder, "What is it? What it
[2:42:33] is?" Some people think it's a rabbit's
[2:42:36] foot that you rub behind your ear. They
[2:42:40] do. Does that sound silly? It sounds
[2:42:42] like today,
[2:42:44] but it isn't. It's the power of the Holy
[2:42:48] Ghost that's been brought in by divine
[2:42:50] grace by God our father. And fill that
[2:42:54] individual with his presence. You will
[2:42:56] RECEIVE LIFE, [screaming]
[2:42:59] &gt;&gt; ETERNAL LIFE, ZOE, GOD'S [screaming] OWN
[2:43:04] LIFE DWELLING IN YOU. OH,
[2:43:09] what a hidden power.
[2:43:13] Look at Judges 14:5 and 6. I just want
[2:43:17] you to at least read the reference.
[2:43:20] Judges 14:5 and 6. Then went Samson down
[2:43:25] and his father and his mother to Timnath
[2:43:30] and came to the vineyards. Oh, Samson,
[2:43:37] why are you going down to where the
[2:43:40] vineyards are?
[2:43:42] You're under a perpetual
[2:43:45] Nazerite vow.
[2:43:48] You It It It ought to make sense. We're
[2:43:51] nearly done. It ought to make sense to
[2:43:53] you if you're supposed to stay away from
[2:43:57] moist grapes, dry grapes, vinegar,
[2:44:01] juice, grape, wine.
[2:44:05] You You do don't really want to take
[2:44:07] your vacation
[2:44:09] to Napa Valley
[2:44:13] because that's where the grapes are.
[2:44:16] But there he goes.
[2:44:19] It's the beginning of his compromises.
[2:44:22] It's the reason why he lost his strength
[2:44:24] and power. It's the reason why he gave
[2:44:27] his secret away. It's the reason why he
[2:44:30] lost his seven locks.
[2:44:32] Because he kept putting himself in a
[2:44:35] position. Hear me now.
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; He kept putting himself in a position
[2:44:40] where compromise was easier than
[2:44:43] resistance. Huh?
[2:44:46] in a position where compromise is easier
[2:44:49] than resistance.
[2:44:51] If I can just get away from my mom and
[2:44:53] daddy's house, I can do what I want to
[2:44:55] do. Oh, can you?
[2:44:57] Well, that's funny because we're going
[2:44:58] to send the Holy Ghost after you.
[2:45:02] &gt;&gt; We're going to believe that God is the
[2:45:04] all-seeing eye and the all hearing ear
[2:45:07] wherever you put your body and that
[2:45:10] he'll hold you to the same standard that
[2:45:12] your parents held you to. And in some of
[2:45:14] your cases, I hope it's a higher
[2:45:16] standard than your parents uh held you
[2:45:20] to because your compromise is partly
[2:45:22] their influence.
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; They went Samson down and to the
[2:45:29] vineyards of Timnath. And behold, a
[2:45:32] young lion roared against him. Okay, he
[2:45:34] was young. And the spirit of THE LORD
[2:45:36] CAME MIGHTILY UPON HIM. Same word.
[2:45:40] OVERTOOK HIM, RUSHED IN UPON HIM, BROKE
[2:45:43] OUT ON HIM.
[2:45:45] &gt;&gt; WASN'T HIS TEMPER, WASN'T HIS FEAR, IT
[2:45:48] WASN'T ADRENALINE.
[2:45:50] IT WASN'T AN OVERACTIVE STRESS RESPONSE.
[2:45:53] &gt;&gt; COME ON. THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD, THE RU
[2:46:00] of Y,
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; YAHWEH,
[2:46:05] THE BREATH OF YAHWEH CAME UPON HIM AND
[2:46:09] he rent him as he would have rent a kid.
[2:46:14] And that's a goat, not a child. And he
[2:46:16] had nothing in his hand.
[2:46:19] No weapon, unarmed,
[2:46:22] no club. Oh, have you seen the picture?
[2:46:26] Have you seen the pictures in the the
[2:46:28] Bible story books? He's got a lion there
[2:46:30] and a club and he's going to hit the
[2:46:32] line. That's not what the scripture
[2:46:33] said. In fact, it's anti-word.
[2:46:36] &gt;&gt; He had NOTHING IN HIS HAND. WHY DO YOU
[2:46:38] THINK IT'S WRITTEN HE HAD NOTHING IN HIS
[2:46:40] HAND? SO THAT YOU WOULDN'T TRUST THE GUN
[2:46:43] OR THE CLUB
[2:46:45] &gt;&gt; OR THE SPEAR OR THE ARROW OR THE BOMB OR
[2:46:49] THE CATAPULT OR THE TANK OR THE BOMBER.
[2:46:53] SO THAT YOU WOULD KNOW THAT VICTORY
[2:46:55] COMES BECAUSE THE SPIRIT OF THE Lord
[2:47:01] &gt;&gt; broke out on him.
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:11] &gt;&gt; He had nothing in his hand, but he told
[2:47:13] not his father or his mother what he had
[2:47:16] done.
[2:47:19] That word here is the same but a little
[2:47:22] variation. It's vit
[2:47:26] and it means it rushed upon him like a
[2:47:30] violent force.
[2:47:32] And in that moment that the spirit of
[2:47:34] the lord came upon him in a violent
[2:47:36] force. He tears that lion in half
[2:47:42] like he was just a little kid.
[2:47:45] One more quotation and we're really
[2:47:47] done. No service Tuesday night. So this
[2:47:49] you can tack this on to Tuesday night.
[2:47:52] This one comes from Acts of the Holy
[2:47:54] Spirit. I've really got this out of
[2:47:56] whack, but I'm almost finished with it.
[2:47:58] Paragraph 44 said, "Look at Samson when
[2:48:01] he found the lion RUN OUT TO KILL HIM
[2:48:05] AND HE SLEW THE LION
[2:48:07] when the power of God came upon him."
[2:48:12] Slew him. WHAT? THERE WAS NOTHING IN HIS
[2:48:15] HAND. HE slew the lion when the power of
[2:48:19] God came upon him. Slew him with his
[2:48:22] bare hand. Just probably did what?
[2:48:27] He probably just pulled his jaws apart.
[2:48:30] I'd say that would hurt him. Wouldn't
[2:48:33] you? You can laugh. You can laugh. I'm
[2:48:37] not preaching longer because you liked
[2:48:39] it. You can laugh. A LITTLE BITTY
[2:48:42] CURLYHEADED SHRIMP about that high.
[2:48:48] Little bitty old fella scrawny. Look.
[2:48:50] Oh, I see some around here. Think make
[2:48:53] me think of that.
[2:48:59] More than one. Some have hair.
[2:49:06] LITTLE BITTY OLD FELLA SCRAWNY ON THE
[2:49:08] STREET. SEVEN LITTLE LOCKS HANGING
[2:49:11] AROUND HIS HEAD LIKE A LITTLE AND
[2:49:13] HE WAS NO he was no more than a little
[2:49:16] [laughter]
[2:49:19] until the spirit of God
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; until the spirit of God came upon him
[2:49:27] and how did the Bible say it came upon
[2:49:29] him mightily
[2:49:33] MIGHTILY NOW IT WOULDN'T BE HARD TO
[2:49:36] believe that a great big giant
[2:49:38] Goliath for instance
[2:49:40] could slay a lion with his hands. I
[2:49:43] believe he could do it. But what's the
[2:49:45] funny thing was this little bitty fella
[2:49:48] done it.
[2:49:50] &gt;&gt; I like it like this. Don't you?
[2:49:52] &gt;&gt; Because then nobody else gets the
[2:49:54] credit, the praise, the accolade.
[2:49:58] &gt;&gt; BUT THE SPIRIT OF [screaming] THE LORD
[2:50:01] CAME UPON him and slew THE LION. HE SLEW
[2:50:05] THE LION, THREW IT OVER TO ONE SIDE, and
[2:50:08] the bees built their hive in there,
[2:50:12] and Samson, the sweetest honey he ever
[2:50:15] eat, come out of the carcass of that
[2:50:18] killed lion. Is that right? Why? He
[2:50:21] overcame it with what?
[2:50:24] &gt;&gt; The power of God. You've got something
[2:50:27] you want to eat sweet honey from.
[2:50:29] Listen,
[2:50:30] is there something operating in your
[2:50:33] life that you would like to see God
[2:50:38] provide honey from it?
[2:50:40] &gt;&gt; Is there something that's been bitter,
[2:50:43] THAT'S BEEN BONDAGE, THAT'S BEEN HARD,
[2:50:45] that's been oppressive, THAT HAS NEARLY
[2:50:48] TAKEN YOU OUT?
[2:50:50] &gt;&gt; COME ON. AND YOU'D LIKE TO SEE GOD DO
[2:50:53] SOMETHING ABOUT IT
[2:50:55] &gt;&gt; AND GIVE YOU A TASTE OF HONEY from the
[2:50:59] middle of the thing that was sent on
[2:51:02] assignment to destroy your life. The Ram
[2:51:05] said, "If you got something you want to
[2:51:07] eat honey from,
[2:51:09] just overcome it." How?
[2:51:12] &gt;&gt; Mind over matter.
[2:51:14] &gt;&gt; Psychology.
[2:51:17] &gt;&gt; Sigman fraud. Who's a fraud?
[2:51:23] or with the power of God.
[2:51:25] The power of God sounds religious. The
[2:51:28] power of God sounds traditional. The
[2:51:30] power of God sounds old-fashioned. The
[2:51:32] power of God might sound outdated or
[2:51:35] antiquated to you, but it's the only
[2:51:37] way.
[2:51:38] &gt;&gt; It's the only way to kill the lion in
[2:51:40] your life. It's the only way to defeat
[2:51:42] the enemy in your life. It's the only
[2:51:44] way to drive OUT THE THE SQUATTERS in
[2:51:46] your life. the Philistines who brought
[2:51:48] their darkness right into the land. God
[2:51:51] wants to use YOU
[2:51:54] WITH HIS POWER
[2:51:56] &gt;&gt; TO RIP THAT ENEMY, TO RIP THAT SPIRIT,
[2:51:59] TO RIP THAT THING, that oppression, that
[2:52:02] burden, that heaviness that has come to
[2:52:04] take you over, to take you under, to
[2:52:07] take you out. And he wants to give you
[2:52:09] something sweet from it. Yes.
[2:52:11] &gt;&gt; He wants to give you strength and power
[2:52:15] to set the fields of the Philistines on
[2:52:17] fire
[2:52:20] &gt;&gt; by tying the tails of jackals. King
[2:52:23] James says foxes,
[2:52:26] tying their tails together and putting
[2:52:28] fire torches in their tails.
[2:52:33] I was I was impressed with foxes, but
[2:52:36] I'm even more impressed if it might have
[2:52:38] been jackals. these these things are
[2:52:40] were hideous. And he just grabs them up
[2:52:43] like little puppies and next thing you
[2:52:44] know, ties their tails together, sticks
[2:52:46] fire brains in them, and sends them. And
[2:52:48] they're just spinning cuz they're all
[2:52:49] tied. Their tails are tied together.
[2:52:52] You've seen a dog chase his tail. What
[2:52:54] do you think several of those wild
[2:52:57] creatures would do with their tails tied
[2:52:58] together and a fire brand did them and
[2:53:00] they go running out through the barley
[2:53:01] fields, setting the enemy's fields on
[2:53:04] fire? We used to sing that song in the
[2:53:06] old church when I was a boy. He will set
[2:53:08] your fields on fire. If to sin is your
[2:53:14] desire.
[2:53:16] You have heard Jesus call. Heed it lest
[2:53:20] you soon must fall. Let the Lord your
[2:53:24] soul inspire.
[2:53:26] If you join the heavenly choir, then
[2:53:30] rejoice with him. When the sun grows
[2:53:34] dim, he will set this world on fire.
[2:53:40] [screaming]
[2:53:43] &gt;&gt; We were rough. We sang rough songs in
[2:53:45] the old
[2:53:49] &gt;&gt; and then they pick it out on the guitar
[2:53:51] like Chad Atkins. It was good days.
[2:53:55] IF YOU got something YOU WANT TO EAT
[2:53:56] SWEET HONEY FROM, OVERCOME IT WITH THE
[2:53:58] POWER OF GOD. WATCH HOW GOOD IT IS. OH
[2:54:01] MY. PASS BY. MAYBE YOU'VE BEEN A DRUNKER
[2:54:03] AND YET EVERY TIME YOU SMELL WHISKEY or
[2:54:05] beer or something, YOU WANT TO DRINK IT.
[2:54:07] OVERCOME IT
[2:54:09] &gt;&gt; BY [screaming] THE POWER OF GOD AND PASS
[2:54:12] BY ONE TIME AND SEE WHAT A [screaming]
[2:54:15] FEELING. WOO! YOU GET IN YOUR HEART
[2:54:19] WHEN ALL THE THING IS DEAD AND GONE THEN
[2:54:22] ALL FINISHED. When you have BEEN ABLE TO
[2:54:25] RESIST,
[2:54:27] &gt;&gt; my brother Brandham is preaching, isn't
[2:54:30] he? Yes, SIR.
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU'RE ABLE TO RESIST THE THING
[2:54:34] THAT CAPTURED YOU AGAIN AND AGAIN AND
[2:54:37] AGAIN.
[2:54:39] &gt;&gt; But today, the power of God gives you
[2:54:41] strength.
[2:54:42] &gt;&gt; And you don't look at the sexy stuff.
[2:54:45] You don't follow the the link.
[2:54:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[2:54:50] &gt;&gt; You go down and sit in the living room
[2:54:51] with your wife. Get out of the back of
[2:54:53] the house, you buzzard.
[2:54:56] &gt;&gt; Get out there where your family is.
[2:54:58] Turn that screen around so that anybody
[2:55:01] that walks in the room can see it.
[2:55:03] &gt;&gt; Do whatever you have to do to overcome
[2:55:05] that thing. And when you do just one
[2:55:07] time, it'll make something happen. It'll
[2:55:10] give you such a peace,
[2:55:13] &gt;&gt; such a joy. HE SAID, "OVERCOME IT by the
[2:55:16] power of God and pass by one time and
[2:55:18] see what a feeling you got in your
[2:55:19] heart. When all the THING IS DEAD AND
[2:55:21] GONE, THEN ALL FINISHED. OH MY, that
[2:55:24] sweet honey, you get out of it." He
[2:55:27] said, 'Now these people had really
[2:55:28] overcome on the day of Pentecost. They
[2:55:31] were all filled with the Holy Ghost. The
[2:55:34] powers of God was upon them. They had
[2:55:37] gifts given to them TO SPEAK WITH
[2:55:40] TONGUES.
[2:55:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:55:41] &gt;&gt; And everything.
[2:55:43] They were just having a marvelous time.
[2:55:48] And the church was on fire.
[2:55:51] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, send the power once more.
[2:55:55] Send it once more, Jesus.
[2:55:58] Hallelujah.
[2:56:00] You didn't believe me.
[2:56:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We need it,
[2:56:07] Lord. We need it. We've got to have it,
[2:56:10] Jesus. We've got to overcome.
[2:56:14] We've got to have it.
[2:56:16] It's you we need. It's you, Jesus, we
[2:56:19] need. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Throughout
[2:56:23] my history,
[2:56:28] your faithfulness
[2:56:30] has walked beside me.
[2:56:36] The winter storms made way for spring.
[2:56:43] &gt;&gt; In every season,
[2:56:46] from where I'm standing,
[2:56:51] the evidence of your goodness
[2:56:56] all over my life.
[2:57:00] All over my life.
[2:57:05] And I see your promises in fulfillment
[2:57:09] [singing]
[2:57:11] all over my life.
[2:57:14] All over my life.
[2:57:18] Oh,
[2:57:20] and I see the evidence of your goodness
[2:57:26] all over my life.
[2:57:29] All over my life.
[2:57:35] And I see your promises in fulfillment
[2:57:41] all over my life.
[2:57:44] All over my life. Help
[2:57:50] me remember when I am weak.
[2:57:57] That fear may come but fear will leave.
[2:58:04] And you lead my heart to victory.
[2:58:11] And you are my strength, Lord. and you
[2:58:15] always
[2:58:16] will be.
[2:58:19] I see the evidence of your goodness.
[2:58:22] [singing]
[2:58:24] It's all over my life.
[2:58:28] All over my life.
[2:58:33] And I see your promises in fulfillment
[2:58:39] all over my life.
[2:58:42] all over my life.
[2:58:47] And help me remember when I am weak.
[2:58:54] Oh, that fear may come, but fear will
[2:58:58] leave.
[2:59:02] And you lead my heart to victory.
[2:59:08] Oh, and you are my strength. And you
[2:59:12] always
[2:59:14] will be.
[2:59:16] I see the evidence of your goodness.
[2:59:22] It's all over my life.
[2:59:25] All over my life. And I see
[2:59:31] I see your promises in fulfillment
[2:59:34] [music]
[2:59:36] all over my life.
[2:59:40] All over my life
[2:59:45] I see the cross, the empty grave.
[2:59:49] The evidence is sinless.
[2:59:52] All my sin was rolled away
[2:59:56] because of you, oh Jesus.
[2:59:59] I see the cross, the empty grave.
[3:00:03] The evidence it's sinless.
[3:00:06] And all my sin was rolled away.
[3:00:10] Because of you, oh Jesus,
[3:00:14] I see the cross, the empty grave. Oh,
[3:00:17] the evidence is sinless.
[3:00:20] All my sin was rolled away
[3:00:24] because of you. Oh Jesus,
[3:00:28] I see the cross, the empty grave.
[3:00:31] The evidence is sinless.
[3:00:35] All my sin was rolled away
[3:00:39] because of you, oh Jesus.
[3:00:42] Oh,
[3:00:46] and I see the evidence of your goodness
[3:00:51] all over my life.
[3:00:55] All over my life. And I see
[3:01:00] I see your promises in fulfillment.
[3:01:05] They are all over my life.
[3:01:10] All over my life.
[3:01:15] And I see the evidence of your goodness
[3:01:21] all over my life.
[3:01:25] &gt;&gt; All over my life. Yes, sir. Thank you,
[3:01:29] Lord.
[3:01:30] &gt;&gt; I see your promises in fulfillment.
[3:01:36] &gt;&gt; All over my life,
[3:01:40] all over my life.
[3:01:45] &gt;&gt; And all the earth will shout your
[3:01:49] praise. Our hearts will cry. These bones
[3:01:54] will sing. Oh, great
[3:01:59] are you, Lord.
[3:02:06] And all the earth will shout your
[3:02:10] praise. Our hearts will cry. These bones
[3:02:15] will sing. How great
[3:02:20] are great great are you Lord
[3:02:26] and all [music] the [singing] earth will
[3:02:30] shout your praise. Our hearts will cry.
[3:02:34] These bones will sing. Oh great
[3:02:40] are you Lord. [singing]
[3:02:45] All the earth and all the earth will
[3:02:50] shout [music] your praise. Our hearts
[3:02:54] will cry. These bones will sing. Oh
[3:02:58] great
[3:03:01] are you, Lord.
[3:03:08] It's your breath
[3:03:10] in our lungs.
[3:03:12] Oh, we pour out our praise. We pour out
[3:03:17] our praise. It's your breath
[3:03:20] in our lungs.
[3:03:23] So we pour out our praise to you all.
[3:03:28] It's your breath
[3:03:31] in our lungs. So we pour out our praise.
[3:03:36] We pour out our praise. to your breath
[3:03:41] in our lungs. [music] So we pour out our
[3:03:46] praise to you only.
[3:03:50] Lord, teach us the life of yieldedness,
[3:03:55] &gt;&gt; the life of consecration,
[3:03:59] &gt;&gt; the life of word inspired priorities.
[3:04:06] Lord, we want to be a people that you
[3:04:09] can work in and work through.
[3:04:12] &gt;&gt; When we see ourselves and when we know
[3:04:14] what we know about ourselves,
[3:04:17] we put ourselves out of it.
[3:04:20] &gt;&gt; And you keep coming by your word and by
[3:04:22] the worship and and by the spirit
[3:04:26] putting us back in.
[3:04:29] We we get tired, Lord, of struggling
[3:04:31] with you,
[3:04:33] wrestling with your angel.
[3:04:36] We just want to believe.
[3:04:41] You know, I'm reminded just now
[3:04:45] a sister and her husband who had an
[3:04:48] interview with Brother Brandham,
[3:04:50] and she said to Brother Brandham, I
[3:04:53] better I better see if I see it here.
[3:04:56] She said to brother Brandham, "I I I
[3:04:59] don't know how I'll find it. I have it
[3:05:01] in my notes." But she said, "I just
[3:05:04] don't feel
[3:05:06] like I'm saved sometime.
[3:05:20] It's really is
[3:05:23] here. it is.
[3:05:25] Her name was Sister Mary and her husband
[3:05:27] was Brother Bill.
[3:05:30] And he said to her, "We can't go by
[3:05:32] feelings.
[3:05:34] We go by the word."
[3:05:37] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham looked at her and
[3:05:38] he said, "90% of the time,
[3:05:42] I don't feel like I'm saved."
[3:05:45] Can you imagine? Well, I wasn't there
[3:05:48] when he said it. And this is her
[3:05:50] testimony that's going around the world.
[3:05:53] She said he said to her 90% of the time
[3:05:56] I don't feel like I'm saved. But he said
[3:05:58] we can't go by that
[3:06:01] &gt;&gt; now. Listen at what he told her. This is
[3:06:03] what I feel like you've got to carry out
[3:06:05] of here. He said we can't go by that.
[3:06:08] What you have to do when you're nervous
[3:06:10] like that, you need to look out there
[3:06:15] and see yourself
[3:06:18] LIKE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE.
[3:06:22] WHAT THE WORD SAYS you are.
[3:06:24] &gt;&gt; And then go by that.
[3:06:26] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that's good
[3:06:28] advice?
[3:06:29] &gt;&gt; YOU JUST GET AN IMAGE.
[3:06:32] &gt;&gt; MAKE YOU AN IMAGE.
[3:06:34] &gt;&gt; MAKE a picture in your mind of what it
[3:06:37] would look like if you were walking in
[3:06:39] the victory that God has already won for
[3:06:41] you. You don't have to WIN IT.
[3:06:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S WON for us.
[3:06:46] &gt;&gt; Look how free you'd be. Let's look out
[3:06:48] over yonder. Everybody turn your HEAD
[3:06:49] THAT WAY. LOOK OUT OVER YONDER AND SEE
[3:06:51] HOW FREE YOU WOULD BE. HOW HOW YOU
[3:06:54] WOULDN'T WORRY OVER EVERY LITTLE THING.
[3:06:57] YOU JUST [screaming] TAKE GOD AT HIS
[3:06:58] WORD AND GO ON REJOICING NO MATTER HOW
[3:07:01] DARK IT LOOKED.
[3:07:03] &gt;&gt; THEN HE SAID YOU JUST START MOVING
[3:07:05] TOWARD THAT.
[3:07:07] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Well, that sounds
[3:07:09] spooky." Does it really? You do worse
[3:07:12] than that in your mind every day.
[3:07:15] &gt;&gt; I do, too. Well, what if and what if and
[3:07:19] what if and what if? Worried, troubled
[3:07:22] about something that may not even h How
[3:07:25] many of you have sorted out things that
[3:07:27] never did happen?
[3:07:30] &gt;&gt; Rung your hands or what if that doctor
[3:07:32] tells me this? What if what if I have to
[3:07:33] do that? What if I what if I what if I
[3:07:35] have what if they tell me I have and it
[3:07:38] don't even happen.
[3:07:39] &gt;&gt; So, don't tell me that it's it's hocus
[3:07:41] pocus to make these things up. Make
[3:07:43] images up. At least this one's got
[3:07:45] truth. It's true. He said, "Just look
[3:07:47] out over yonder and see yourself how the
[3:07:50] word has you. Oh Lord, it has me free.
[3:07:52] It has me healed. It has me whole. It
[3:07:55] has me delivered from all my pain of the
[3:07:57] past. I don't have any more daddy issues
[3:08:00] or mama issues or other other kinds of
[3:08:03] issues, inferiority complexes OR OR OR
[3:08:06] WHATEVER ELSE
[3:08:08] &gt;&gt; over yonder that one the word says I am.
[3:08:10] Now, if I move toward that and ignore
[3:08:13] the rest,
[3:08:14] &gt;&gt; don't you know he's able to roll us over
[3:08:16] the tide?
[3:08:18] &gt;&gt; Let me pray for you. If you feel like
[3:08:20] you spend too much time in the whatifs
[3:08:24] and not enough time in seeing what God
[3:08:26] has already done and said, just hold up
[3:08:29] your hand. I'm not even looking.
[3:08:32] You don't have to be ashamed of it. It's
[3:08:33] a reality of this life. But neither do
[3:08:36] you have to keep repeating wrong
[3:08:38] behavior. I want you just to hold your
[3:08:40] hands to him. Then we won't know who did
[3:08:43] what. Father, here we are. We're just
[3:08:46] humans. You made us. You know how it is
[3:08:48] to live in a body of flesh. And so many
[3:08:52] times we worry and we're troubled and we
[3:08:55] make dumb quick decisions over
[3:08:58] suppositions, over things we suppose
[3:09:01] could be. FATHER, WHAT SIMPLE ADVICE
[3:09:05] YOUR PROPHET gave this little sister.
[3:09:08] And and IF YOU JUST HELP US TO SEE WHAT
[3:09:10] your word says we are out there
[3:09:12] somewhere
[3:09:13] and give us faith, maybe you should may
[3:09:16] maybe we need to ask you to move on us
[3:09:18] mightily by the spirit of the Lord and
[3:09:21] help us to find our way to what you say
[3:09:23] we are.
[3:09:26] Faith
[3:09:27] replacing, displacing doubt
[3:09:31] and TRUTH
[3:09:34] DRIVING out lies.
[3:09:38] May we become
[3:09:40] the very anointed of the Lord. Every one
[3:09:42] of us. Every mama in her home, on her
[3:09:45] job,
[3:09:47] every daddy,
[3:09:49] every husband, every wife, every young
[3:09:52] person.
[3:09:53] May we just come under a greater
[3:09:57] heaviness of your anointing
[3:10:00] to be changed
[3:10:03] to get out of our heads
[3:10:07] to move into your heart.
[3:10:10] Your purpose is your plans.
[3:10:12] Your word is yay and amen.
[3:10:17] People have worried this week over who's
[3:10:19] going to make the gravy.
[3:10:26] and all other kinds of foolish things
[3:10:29] that matter nothing.
[3:10:32] Cuz the day after it's all over and
[3:10:34] forgotten,
[3:10:36] if somebody forgot the gravy, guess
[3:10:38] what? We just ate it without it. Nobody
[3:10:40] cared the next day. Lord, please help us
[3:10:43] not to get caught up with so many little
[3:10:45] things. May we just move in faith
[3:10:48] knowing that you have a plan and a
[3:10:50] purpose. And may we not use up any brain
[3:10:53] power over things that matter not. May
[3:10:56] we just when we read that word, may we
[3:10:59] just get a clear picture of who you've
[3:11:00] called us to be and let faith arise and
[3:11:03] move us in that direction in the name of
[3:11:06] Jesus.
[3:11:08] Somebody could, one person, maybe a
[3:11:10] streamer could take this right now and
[3:11:13] have a different day, a different
[3:11:15] evening, a different week because they
[3:11:18] began to see themselves as God has seen
[3:11:21] them and said they are in the word.
[3:11:23] Lord, LET IT BE SO. HEAL THE SICK.
[3:11:26] You're still a healer.
[3:11:29] You paid the price. We claim it today.
[3:11:32] In the matchless name of the Lord Jesus
[3:11:35] Christ, we ask for help. And we're going
[3:11:38] to give God a hand clap of praise. Let's
[3:11:40] do it. [applause]
[3:11:49] You can go back to your seats for just a
[3:11:51] moment. We'll get ready to go home. And
[3:11:54] uh I'm going to do one thing.
[3:11:57] Before I do,
[3:12:00] if I can have this one on,
[3:12:03] I'm going to sing one more song and it's
[3:12:06] not for you, but you can listen.
[3:12:11] But when Joshua came out to the
[3:12:13] platform, where is Elelliana? Oh, there
[3:12:16] she is. When Joshua came out to the
[3:12:19] platform to bring me a drink, he said,
[3:12:21] "Dad, I know you're, you know, you're
[3:12:23] probably not going to sing again, but if
[3:12:24] you were to sing again, Elelliana's been
[3:12:26] asking the whole service for Ghost."
[3:12:30] I said, "I don't know what he said."
[3:12:32] Well, they were listening to it on the
[3:12:34] earlier this morning. So, let's do a
[3:12:36] couple verses in chorus of Holy Ghost
[3:12:39] will set your feet to dancing. For
[3:12:41] Elelliana, she turned 18 months old this
[3:12:44] week. I had my first visitation from the
[3:12:48] Lord when I was 18 months old. So, look
[3:12:51] at that little child there and how how
[3:12:53] tall she is and what she looks like. I
[3:12:55] wasn't that pretty, but I was that age
[3:12:58] when when he visited me the first time.
[3:13:01] Let's sing this to the Lord. You might
[3:13:03] not be able to sit down, but if you need
[3:13:04] to, you can. The Holy Ghost will set
[3:13:08] your feet to dancing.
[3:13:11] The Holy Ghost will thrill you through
[3:13:13] and through.
[3:13:15] The Holy Ghost will [music] set your
[3:13:17] feet a dancing.
[3:13:19] He will set your heart a dancing too.
[3:13:23] Come on. Well, the Holy [music] Ghost
[3:13:25] will set your feet a dancing.
[3:13:29] The Holy Ghost will thrill you through
[3:13:31] and through.
[3:13:33] The Holy Ghost will set your feet a
[3:13:36] dancing.
[3:13:38] He'll set your [music] heart and
[3:13:39] dancing, too.
[3:13:42] Well, now David danced before the Lord
[3:13:45] to magnify his name. In God's almighty
[3:13:48] presence, he felt no sense of [music]
[3:13:51] shame. The oil of gladness flow that
[3:13:54] day. It quickened every part. And God
[3:13:57] gave brother David and shout in his
[3:14:00] heart. Oh, the Holy Ghost will set your
[3:14:03] feet a dancing.
[3:14:05] The Holy Ghost [music] will thrill you
[3:14:07] through and through.
[3:14:10] The Holy Ghost will set your feet a
[3:14:12] dancing. [music]
[3:14:14] He'll set your heart a dancing too.
[3:14:18] Well, now out of Egypt, long ago, the
[3:14:22] Israelites were led by a mighty miracle.
[3:14:26] They [music and singing] were all kept
[3:14:27] and fed through the Red Sea. They were
[3:14:30] brought. The waters [music] stood apart.
[3:14:33] And God gave Sister Miriam a dance in
[3:14:36] her heart. There was [music] a
[3:14:38] celebration upon the red sea shore.
[3:14:42] Timberl desert [music] sand became a
[3:14:45] dancing floor. [singing] The people sang
[3:14:47] and praised God there. He made gloom
[3:14:50] depart. [music] He put a dance of love
[3:14:53] and joy deep down in their heart. Oh,
[3:14:56] the Holy Ghost will [music] set your
[3:14:58] feet to dancing. Hallelujah. The Holy
[3:15:07] dancing
[3:15:09] and set your heart and dancing [music]
[3:15:12] too.
[3:15:13] Well, the prodigal was far away
[3:15:17] wondering out in sin. [music]
[3:15:19] But he came back to father's house.
[3:15:21] Father took him in. He put a robe upon
[3:15:25] his son. A very near immen. [music]
[3:15:28] That old prodal got dancing beat to
[3:15:30] match his dancing heart. The Holy Ghost
[3:15:33] [music] will set your feet a dancing.
[3:15:36] Hallelujah. The Holy Ghost will thrill
[3:15:39] you through and through.
[3:15:42] The Holy Ghost [music] will set your
[3:15:44] feet a dancing.
[3:15:46] Set your heart a dancing too. Well, now
[3:15:51] many saints are cold and bound [music]
[3:15:53] by unbelief today. They say they want
[3:15:56] the blessings of the Lord, but worry
[3:15:58] what men may say. Let the Lord have full
[3:16:02] control. [music] Dead traditions part.
[3:16:05] God will set you free within. Go get a
[3:16:08] dancing [music] heart. Oh, the Holy
[3:16:10] Ghost will set your feet a dancing.
[3:16:14] The Holy Ghost will th [music] you in
[3:16:16] the room.
[3:16:18] The Holy Ghost will set your feet a
[3:16:21] dancing.
[3:16:26] [music] One more time. The prodigal was
[3:16:29] far away, wandering out in sin. He came
[3:16:33] back to father's [music] house. Father
[3:16:35] took him in. He put a robe upon his son.
[3:16:39] The merry man did star. [music] That
[3:16:41] prodigal got dancing deep to match his
[3:16:44] dancing heart. The other verse goes with
[3:16:46] that. The father's [music] house with
[3:16:48] music rang to welcome home the son. The
[3:17:03] heart like all the [music] others there.
[3:17:05] Wo! The Holy Ghost will set your feet to
[3:17:08] dancing.
[3:17:13] Woo!
[3:17:14] The Holy Ghost will [music] set your
[3:17:17] feet to dancing
[3:17:19] and set your heart a dancing too.
[3:17:23] Well, now many saints are [music] cold
[3:17:25] and bound by unbelief today. They say
[3:17:28] they want the blessings of the Lord, but
[3:17:31] worry what men may say. Just let the
[3:17:33] Lord have full control. Dead tradition
[3:17:36] part and God will [music] set you free
[3:17:39] within. You'll have an answer. Now,
[3:17:41] Sister Martha, the ne the other part,
[3:17:46] the other part of that verse. Now in the
[3:17:48] Bible we can read that in the latter
[3:17:51] days men would leave their first love
[3:17:54] and turn to carnal ways. But trueborn
[3:17:57] saints [music] of Jesus for the
[3:17:59] bridegroom set apart watching for his
[3:18:02] coming with a joyful [music] dancing
[3:18:05] heart. Oh the Holy Ghost will set your
[3:18:08] feet a dancing.
[3:18:10] The Holy Ghost will reel you through and
[3:18:12] through.
[3:18:15] The Holy Ghost will set your feet a
[3:18:17] dancing. [music]
[3:18:19] Set your heart of dancing. Set your
[3:18:22] heart of dancing. Set your heart of
[3:18:25] dancing [music]
[3:18:26] too.
[3:18:33] Glory.
[3:18:38] Amen.
[3:18:40] &gt;&gt; God bless you all. Have a wonderful
[3:18:43] Thanksgiving.
[3:18:44] and uh you're dismissed to go. Thank you
[3:18:47] for indulging us.
[3:18:52] You'll have a grandbaby one day and
[3:18:54] you'll want to do it too.
[3:18:58] [snorts] Or two or three or 10 or 12.
[3:19:01] God bless you all. Thank you for being
[3:19:03] here today. Pray for those who couldn't
[3:19:05] be here. God bless you. Please continue
[3:19:09] to pray for Sister Flo and her family. I
[3:19:12] don't know anything about arrangements,
[3:19:14] but when we hear, we'll let you know. I
[3:19:16] bless you.
