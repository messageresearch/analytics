[0:00] he caused his Destinies to be aborted
[0:05] and he used his hope deferred
[0:12] [Music]
[0:13] let me ask you a question
[0:15] has anybody had any any failure in your
[0:18] past
[0:20] any pain in your past any
[0:22] disappointments in your past any
[0:25] weaknesses in your past every one of us
[0:28] and the enemy wants to build on that
[0:30] place
[0:31] that's the foundation he uses the the
[0:34] Church of the Living God is built on the
[0:35] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[0:37] which is the Chief Cornerstone the Lord
[0:39] Jesus Christ
[0:40] but death structures are built on the
[0:42] foundation of past pain past failure
[0:44] past disappointment and past weaknesses
[0:49] he then attempts to establish a strategy
[0:52] that becomes a structure
[0:55] resulting
[0:57] in the abandonment or death of vision
[1:01] and abortion of Destiny Hope deferred so
[1:06] what happens is the enemy moves in on
[1:08] disappointments of the past and failures
[1:10] and pain and weaknesses and he and he
[1:13] kills any hope any Vision Any Dream for
[1:17] the future he causes Destinies to be
[1:20] aborted
[1:23] and he used his hope deferred the Bible
[1:26] did say give not space to the enemy
[1:29] don't give the devil space don't give
[1:33] him up listen to me
[1:36] don't give the enemy a place to work in
[1:40] your emotions
[1:41] I'm telling you now it's your
[1:44] opportunity
[1:46] to disease the moment
[1:49] batting down the hatches and quitting
[1:51] like men and raise up and ask the Lord
[1:55] to strengthen you so that the enemy he
[1:58] may knock
[2:01] he may stand in the window and threaten
[2:04] and huff and blow huff and puff and blow
[2:08] your house down but you just tell him
[2:10] no no you're on the outside looking in
[2:12] I'd rather be on the inside looking out
[2:14] than to be on the outside looking in you
[2:17] want to be in here you low down dirty
[2:19] Thief
[2:20] but the blood of Jesus has piped this
[2:23] place
[2:24] you're not coming in here
[2:27] it can bind the strong man he will come
[2:31] in and thoroughly plunder your life he
[2:36] will steal your dreams
[2:37] [Music]
[2:41] he'll steal your children
[2:43] he'll steal your health
[2:46] he'll produce a death structure all
[2:48] around you where Everything You Touch
[2:50] fails
[2:51] somebody's got to hold on when everybody
[2:55] around you is giving up somebody has to
[2:58] take a hold of God's word and say I
[3:01] refuse
[3:02] to surrender one inch of ground
[3:06] I'm on a stand on this truth and I'm
[3:10] going to hold on to the promises of God
