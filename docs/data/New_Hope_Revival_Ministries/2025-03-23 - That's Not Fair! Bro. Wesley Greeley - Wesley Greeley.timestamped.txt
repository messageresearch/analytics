[5:51] Praise the Lord.
[5:55] Where do I
[5:58] go when there's no one else to turn to?
[6:03] Who do I talk
[6:05] to? When no one wants to listen? Who do
[6:10] I lean
[6:12] on? When there's no foundation stable, I
[6:17] go to the rock I know that's able. I go
[6:21] to the
[6:23] rock. I go to the rock of my salvation.
[6:28] Go to the stone that the builders
[6:30] rejected. I run to the mountain and the
[6:34] mountain stands by
[6:37] me. The earth all around me is sinking
[6:41] sand. On Christ the solid rock I stand.
[6:46] When I need a shelter, when I need a
[6:49] friend, I go to the
[6:52] rock. Where do I
[6:56] hide? Till the storms have all passed
[7:00] over, where do I run
[7:04] to when the winds of sorrows threaten?
[7:08] Is there a
[7:11] reuge in that time of
[7:14] tribulation? When my soul needs
[7:17] consolation, I go to the rock.
[7:21] Hallelujah. I go to the rock of my
[7:25] salvation. I go to the stone that the
[7:28] builders rejected. I run to the mountain
[7:32] and the mountain stands by me.
[7:37] The earth all around me is sinking sand.
[7:40] On Christ the solid rock I stand. When I
[7:45] need a shelter, when I need a friend, I
[7:48] go to the
[7:51] rock. And where do I
[7:54] go? When there's no one else to turn to.
[7:59] And who do I talk
[8:02] to when no one wants to listen? Who do I
[8:07] lean
[8:09] on when there's no foundation stable? I
[8:13] go to the rock. I know that's stable. I
[8:17] go to the rock. Sing it out. I go to the
[8:22] rock of my salvation. I go to the stone
[8:26] that the builders rejected. I run to the
[8:29] mountain and the mountain stands by me.
[8:34] Hallelujah. We earth all around me is
[8:37] sinking sand. On Christ the solid rock I
[8:42] stand. When I need a shelter, when I
[8:45] need a friend, I go to the
[8:49] rock. Where do I
[8:53] hide? Till the storms have all passed
[8:56] over. Where do I run
[9:00] to when the winds of sorrows threaten?
[9:05] Is there a
[9:07] reuge in the time of
[9:11] tribulation? When my soul needs
[9:14] consolation, I go to the
[9:17] rock. Hallelujah. I go to the rock of my
[9:22] salvation. I go to the stone that the
[9:25] builders rejected. I run to the mountain
[9:29] and the mountain stands by
[9:33] me. The earth all around me is sinking
[9:37] sand. On Christ the solid rock I stand.
[9:42] When I need a shelter, when I need a
[9:44] friend, I go to the
[9:47] rock. Oh, I go to the rock of my
[9:51] salvation. I go to the stone that the
[9:55] builders rejected. I run to the mountain
[9:58] and the mountain stands by
[10:02] me. The earth all around me is sinking
[10:06] sand. On Christ the solid rock I stand.

[40:15] the Lord's feet. Take it to him. He is a
[40:19] father that loves you.
[40:23] Open your hearts and your minds to his
[40:26] word and allow him to do his work in you
[40:30] to perfect your faith. As you lay it
[40:33] before him, he is faithful to give you
[40:37] strength to endure. Nothing will come
[40:41] upon you that his grace is not
[40:43] sufficient to
[40:44] handle. Lay it at his feet. He loves
[40:47] you. He wants you to be in his presence.
[40:49] He wants you to come to him, Lord.
[40:52] So I just ask right now
[40:57] that each
[40:59] heart, each
[41:01] mind as we focus on
[41:03] you that you draw us closer to you. A
[41:06] deep calling to the
[41:08] deep and reveal yourself, Lord. For
[41:11] those who have not truly known your
[41:14] presence, I ask you to draw them into
[41:17] it.
[41:18] Lord, help them understand the peace
[41:21] that passes all understanding. The joy
[41:23] that does not come from certain events,
[41:25] but comes from a presence.
[41:28] Lord, we lay it all at your feet. Lord,
[41:31] I ask you to bless your servant this
[41:34] day. Let him bring us the
[41:37] word. Hide it in our hearts that we may
[41:40] be drawn closer to you. That we may love
[41:42] you and worship you and give you glory.
[41:45] that you will receive praise that is due
[41:49] you. Yes. The only true God, the only
[41:53] one that when he moved all things were
[41:56] created
[41:58] by the faith that you place in your own
[42:01] word, all things are created for your
[42:04] pleasure
[42:06] and you gave us a portion of that. So we
[42:09] lay our faith at your feet and say,
[42:11] "Have thy perfect work in us." Yes,
[42:14] Lord. We love you. We praise you. We
[42:16] thank you for coming in a body of flesh
[42:20] to give us an example
[42:22] to say, "It is written." Hallelujah. And
[42:25] turn it all over to you. Thank you,
[42:27] Lord. We pray it all in the precious
[42:28] name of our Lord and Savior Yeshua
[42:30] Hamashiach. Amen.
[42:34] Amen. Amen.
[42:35] [Applause]
[42:38] Amen. Let's just We're going to sing
[42:40] that again. And Sister Jeffrey, would
[42:41] you come and get ready to sing
[42:43] today in the
[42:46] [Music]
[42:51] presence of
[42:58] Jehovah, God
[43:04] [Music]
[43:05] Almighty, Prince of Peace,
[43:13] East
[43:14] trles vanish.
[43:17] [Music]
[43:21] Hearts are
[43:27] mened in the
[43:34] presence of the
[43:39] King. Amen. Let's give the Lord a hand
[43:41] clap of praise as we're seated today.
[43:47] Um, IAS and Jubel, would y'all mind come
[43:50] help me with the offering? Y'all go to
[43:52] them this morning as she sings.
[43:56] [Music]
[44:01] [Music]
[44:08] Amen. Right now it seems like the world
[44:13] is against you. Maybe it
[44:19] is. And right now you feel like your
[44:23] heart is in pieces. Maybe it
[44:28] [Music]
[44:30] is. You think you've walked every mile
[44:34] you can walk and you don't have the will
[44:38] to
[44:41] survive. You have exhausted each ounce
[44:45] of your strength. O
[44:48] why the
[44:51] try? Let me remind you Jesus is for you.
[44:58] He's right when everything's
[45:02] wrong. I'm here to tell you he will not
[45:07] leave you. He never abandons his
[45:13] own. Even though you may not see it
[45:16] right now, you're not in this
[45:22] [Music]
[45:24] alone. He is the friend who will never
[45:29] betray you. That's who he
[45:35] is. He is the love who is constant in
[45:40] sorrow.
[45:42] That's who he
[45:46] is. His plan is greater than what you
[45:51] have planned. Even though it's not clear
[45:54] to you
[45:57] yet, he's always worked everything for
[46:01] your good. At times we forget.
[46:08] Let me remind you Jesus is for you. He's
[46:14] right when everything's
[46:18] wrong. I'm here to tell you he will not
[46:23] leave you. He never abandons his
[46:29] own. Even though you may not see it
[46:32] right now, you're not in this alone.
[46:38] I wanted to dedicate this sister Flo
[46:41] before you even came to church today.
[46:43] This song was for you and for my
[46:46] daughter. This song is for you. Even
[46:50] though we walk in places that we're not
[46:53] familiar with, Jason, it's for you also.
[46:58] Sometimes the
[47:01] past it
[47:05] says the plan is greater than what you
[47:08] had planned even though it's not clear
[47:11] to you yet. It's just not clear. We
[47:13] can't always see it.
[47:16] But you're not in this alone.
[47:22] [Music]
[47:25] He is the friend who will never betray
[47:29] you. Martha, you
[47:34] too. He is the one who is conant in
[47:40] sorrow. That's who he
[47:45] is. His plan is greater than what you
[47:50] had planned. Even though it's not clear
[47:53] to you
[47:56] yet, he's always
[47:59] working for your good at times. We
[48:06] forget. Let me remind you, Jesus is for
[48:12] you. He's right when everything's wrong.
[48:18] I'm here to tell you he will not leave
[48:22] you. He never abandons his
[48:27] own. Even though you may not see it
[48:31] right now, you're not in this alone.
[48:40] I'm here to tell you he will not leave
[48:44] you. He never abandons his
[48:49] own. Even though you may not see it
[48:52] right now, you're not in this
[49:00] [Music]
[49:03] alone. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[49:10] Amen.
[49:14] Amen. Let's all stand and get ready to
[49:16] go to the word today. Something keeps
[49:20] [Music]
[49:25] holding me.
[49:30] Every day I
[49:33] see he's helping me
[49:36] faithfully to overcome my
[49:41] trials. He's guiding me
[49:46] constantly. He's giving me
[49:50] victory. It's a
[49:53] reality. Something keeps holding me.
[50:00] The trial of this world was getting
[50:08] closer. The pull I felt was more than I
[50:12] could bear.
[50:17] And I was on the verge of just giving
[50:24] over. The strength within myself and
[50:28] just wasn't
[50:31] there. Something keeps holding me.
[50:36] Every day I
[50:39] see he's helping me
[50:42] faithfully to overcome my
[50:47] trials. He's guiding me
[50:51] constantly. He's giving me
[50:56] victory. It's a
[50:59] reality. Something keeps holding me.
[51:06] Satan laid before me his
[51:10] [Music]
[51:12] temptation of his desire to steal away
[51:17] my
[51:21] faith. But I have found in time the
[51:28] revelation the strength I need to keep
[51:32] me by his grace.
[51:36] Something keeps holding
[51:40] me every day.
[51:44] [Music]
[52:13] Every day I
[52:16] see helping me
[52:19] faithfully overcome my
[52:24] trust, guiding me
[52:28] constantly, giving me
[52:30] [Music]
[52:32] victory. It's a
[52:35] reality. Something keeps holding me.
[52:44] Oh yes, Lord.
[52:50] Lord, I thank you for holding me
[52:54] [Music]
[52:57] faithfully, helping me to overcome my
[53:00] trials.
[53:05] [Music]
[53:07] Satan had an ambition.
[53:11] He wanted to snare me.
[53:14] Boy, I thank you, Lord, for the
[53:17] revelation.
[53:21] that by
[53:23] faith
[53:25] Adam, by faith
[53:29] Moses, by faith
[53:32] Noah, by faith
[53:34] Enoch, and by faith Wes Gley, I will
[53:39] make it by the grace of God. You have
[53:44] come with the revelation of faith in the
[53:47] end time that I will make it.
[53:52] Oh, I thank you for it, Lord. Something
[53:55] keeps holding me.
[54:00] Every day I
[54:02] see helping me
[54:06] faithfully, overcome my
[54:11] trials, guiding me
[54:15] constantly, giving me
[54:19] victory. It's a
[54:22] reality. Jesus is holding me.
[54:28] [Music]
[54:32] And victory is
[54:35] mine. Victory is mine. Victory today is
[54:42] mine. Well, I told Satan, "Get bee
[54:48] behind. Victory today, it is
[54:52] mine." Oh yes, victory is mine. Victory
[54:58] is
[54:59] mine. Victory today is
[55:04] mine. Well, I told Satan, get me
[55:09] behind. Victory today. It is
[55:14] mine. Oh, healing is
[55:17] mine. Healing is mine.
[55:21] healing
[55:25] today. I told Satan, "Get me
[55:31] behind. Healing today. It is
[55:35] mine." Oh, the Holy Ghost is mine.
[55:42] The Holy Ghost today is
[55:49] mine to get thee behind the Holy Ghost
[55:54] today. One more time. Victory. Oh,
[55:58] victory is
[56:00] mine. Victory is
[56:03] mine. Victory today is mine.
[56:08] Oh, and I told Satan to get
[56:13] behind victory today. It is mine.
[56:20] [Applause]
[56:21] [Music]
[56:22] [Applause]
[56:25] [Music]
[56:26] [Applause]
[56:27] [Music]
[56:28] Hallelujah.
[56:30] Anybody today have the victory?
[56:33] Glad I have the victory.
[56:36] And it's not because of a feeling. It's
[56:39] because I know who he is and he is the
[56:42] victor and I am in him.
[56:45] Amen.
[56:47] We're certainly glad to see you in the
[56:49] house of the Lord
[56:51] today. Many are
[56:54] away, it seems, but uh we're glad that
[56:57] you're here.
[56:59] I bless you in the name of the Lord. All
[57:01] of you that are watching this service by
[57:03] way of stream, we greet you today in the
[57:06] lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[57:08] We're glad that you have tuned in to
[57:10] this service. We want to look to the
[57:12] word today. If you have your Bibles, we
[57:15] want to turn to Ezekiel chapter 18.
[57:18] Would you help me to thank all of these
[57:19] musicians
[57:21] [Applause]
[57:23] today? Now, remember, the longer you're
[57:26] back there, the more you miss. I'm not
[57:28] Brother Shelly.
[57:37] Ezekiel chapter
[57:44] 18 and I would like to start in verse
[57:47] 19.
[57:52] I almost sent out
[57:56] a churchwide text to tell you to bring
[58:00] your
[58:02] Bibles because I wasn't sure that we'd
[58:05] have anybody back there to run that
[58:06] screen because they said that some of
[58:09] these newer ones that are learning
[58:11] didn't quite know how to run it. But by
[58:13] the grace of God and with the help of
[58:16] some that uh knew a little bit and some
[58:20] more that knew a little bit, it looks
[58:21] like we're going to have success today.
[58:24] Ezekiel 18 and verse
[58:27] 19. Yet you say
[58:31] why? Now the previous verses are talking
[58:35] about how that the iniquities or the the
[58:39] sins of the fathers come on to the sons
[58:42] and they have to bear that iniquity. So
[58:45] now in verse 19, yet you say, why? Why
[58:49] do not the son bear the iniquity? Or why
[58:53] do not the son bear the iniquity of the
[58:57] father? When the son hath done that
[59:00] which is lawful and right, and hath kept
[59:04] all my statutes, and hath done them, he
[59:07] shall surely live.
[59:10] The soul that sinnth it shall
[59:15] die. The son shall not bear the iniquity
[59:18] of the father, neither shall the father
[59:20] bear the iniquity of the son. The
[59:23] righteousness of the righteous shall be
[59:26] upon him, and the wickedness of the
[59:29] wicked shall be upon him. But if the
[59:32] wicked will turn from all his sins that
[59:36] he hath committed, and keep all my
[59:39] statutes, and do that which is lawful
[59:42] and right, he shall surely live. He
[59:46] shall not
[59:48] die. All his transgressions that he hath
[59:51] committed, they shall not be mentioned
[59:53] unto him. In his righteousness that he
[59:57] hath done, he shall live. Have I any
[1:00:01] pleasure at all that the wicked should
[1:00:03] die, saith the Lord God, and not that he
[1:00:07] should return from his ways and live?
[1:00:10] But when the righteous turns away from
[1:00:12] his righteousness, and commits iniquity,
[1:00:16] and does according to all the
[1:00:18] abominations that the wicked man doth,
[1:00:20] shall he
[1:00:21] live? All his righteousness that he hath
[1:00:25] done shall not be mentioned. In his
[1:00:28] trespass that he has trespassed, and in
[1:00:31] his sin that he has sinned, in them
[1:00:34] shall he
[1:00:35] die. Yet you say, "The way of the Lord
[1:00:39] is not
[1:00:42] equal." Hear now, oh house of Israel, is
[1:00:46] not my way equal. Are not your ways
[1:00:51] unequal?
[1:00:53] When a righteous man turns away from his
[1:00:56] righteousness and commits iniquity and
[1:00:59] dies in them, for his iniquity that he
[1:01:02] has done, shall he die. Again, when the
[1:01:05] wicked man turns away from his
[1:01:07] wickedness that he has committed, and
[1:01:10] doth that which is lawful and right, he
[1:01:12] shall save his soul alive. because he
[1:01:16] considerth and turneth away from all his
[1:01:19] transgressions that he hath committed,
[1:01:21] he shall surely live, he shall not die.
[1:01:25] Yet saith the house of Israel, the way
[1:01:28] of the Lord is not equal. Oh house of
[1:01:31] Israel, are not my ways equal? Are not
[1:01:34] your ways
[1:01:36] unequal? Therefore I will judge you, oh
[1:01:39] house of Israel, everyone according to
[1:01:41] his ways, sayaeth the Lord God. Repent
[1:01:45] and turn yourselves from all your
[1:01:48] transgressions, so iniquity shall not be
[1:01:51] your ruin. Cast away from you all your
[1:01:54] transgressions, whereby you have
[1:01:56] transgressed, and make you a new heart
[1:01:59] and a new spirit. For why will you die,
[1:02:02] oh house of Israel? For I have no
[1:02:05] pleasure in the death of him that dieth,
[1:02:08] saeth the Lord. Wherefore turn
[1:02:11] yourselves and live
[1:02:14] ye. Let us pray before you're seated
[1:02:17] today. Our
[1:02:19] father,
[1:02:21] we are presenting oursel for this
[1:02:25] service today that you would do here
[1:02:29] what you desire to do. We want to thank
[1:02:32] you that you are here, that you have
[1:02:37] commissioned and dispatched the angels
[1:02:40] to this place. We welcome them and ask
[1:02:44] that they be in their positions at this
[1:02:47] time. Every one of them be in their
[1:02:50] divine order. And may we be in our
[1:02:53] position and in divine order as well. I
[1:02:56] pray, oh God, that anything that would
[1:02:59] try to disturb or distract us today
[1:03:02] would be cast forth from this place in
[1:03:04] the lovely name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:06] Christ. and we now just settle ourselves
[1:03:10] into the presence of the Lord that you
[1:03:12] may come and speak to us from the word
[1:03:16] of God that we can get something that
[1:03:19] would help us in this hour in in the in
[1:03:22] the overcoming portion that we have been
[1:03:25] allotted in this hour. May the word
[1:03:28] today be another uh weapon in our
[1:03:32] arsenal to be able to fight the enemy. I
[1:03:35] pray this in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:38] Christ that you get all glory. Now hide
[1:03:41] your
[1:03:42] servant. May I speak only words that
[1:03:45] would edify and bring strength and help
[1:03:48] and grace to the hearer. In the name of
[1:03:50] the Lord Jesus Christ I pray. Amen. You
[1:03:55] may have your seats today.
[1:04:02] When we look at passages in
[1:04:05] the older covenant, the Old
[1:04:09] Testament, and we read a passage like
[1:04:12] this where that the Lord is rebuking the
[1:04:16] children of Israel, he's he's giving
[1:04:18] them instruction and rebuking them all
[1:04:20] at the same time uh to to try to help
[1:04:23] them to see that um that a
[1:04:29] man would uh that would live
[1:04:34] righteously. If he would all of the
[1:04:36] sudden decide he was tired of living a
[1:04:38] righteous life and he would go and he
[1:04:42] would throw it all to the wind, so to
[1:04:45] speak, and start living a wicked life
[1:04:49] that all of his righteousness would be
[1:04:53] forgotten. And likewise a wicked man
[1:04:57] when he had lived a wicked life
[1:05:00] and all of the sudden he started trying
[1:05:03] to live a righteous life that the
[1:05:06] righteousness would be what would
[1:05:08] remembered. We of the newer covenant are
[1:05:11] are blessed because we don't have to
[1:05:14] live under the law. We don't have to
[1:05:16] live and there is no righteousness that
[1:05:19] we can present to God that is good
[1:05:22] enough.
[1:05:24] and all of our righteousness is as
[1:05:26] filthy rags. And it is by the blood of
[1:05:31] Jesus Christ that we can come to him and
[1:05:35] know that all of our righteousness that
[1:05:38] we could ever present to him was not
[1:05:40] good enough. And and it it wouldn't
[1:05:43] stand the test of time. It would not
[1:05:45] stand in his presence. Yet because of
[1:05:49] his goodness to us, we we know that the
[1:05:53] lamb is on the throne. We know that he
[1:05:57] has already paid the price on our behalf
[1:06:00] and and that we are in Christ. the the
[1:06:04] perfect sacrifice is on the throne and
[1:06:08] and we uh are living the life that we
[1:06:13] live because we are grateful people to
[1:06:17] what he has done. Amen.
[1:06:20] And we have stories that we have heard
[1:06:24] over time of of men and perhaps women
[1:06:28] that would would live a space of time
[1:06:33] and they would live what appeared to be
[1:06:36] a righteous life. They served the Lord.
[1:06:39] They worked in his kingdom. And and
[1:06:42] after a time, for whatever reason, they
[1:06:45] may start to slip. And you see God
[1:06:48] remove them off of the scene so that
[1:06:51] they don't bring reproach to the gospel.
[1:06:54] Whereas others that have lived uh uh
[1:06:58] seemingly good lives and and God doesn't
[1:07:01] choose to take them off the scene. He
[1:07:04] lets all of their wickedness be exposed
[1:07:07] after they live for some time doing the
[1:07:10] good works of the Lord Jesus Christ. But
[1:07:13] as a believer, it is our duty, our
[1:07:16] privilege, our love that we present
[1:07:19] ourselves to him, a living sacrifice.
[1:07:22] And that everything that we are,
[1:07:25] everything we do, everything that we
[1:07:27] say, every way that we act, it is
[1:07:30] because of the goodness of God that he
[1:07:34] has given into our lives.
[1:07:37] I read this scripture because I wanted
[1:07:41] to take out of it uh uh some phrases
[1:07:44] here. When the Lord asked the house of
[1:07:48] Israel, "Is not my way
[1:07:53] equal? Are not your ways unequal?"
[1:07:59] And then verse 29, yet saith the house
[1:08:01] of Israel, the
[1:08:05] Lord, the way of the Lord is not
[1:08:09] equal. Oh house of Israel, are not my
[1:08:12] ways equal? Are not your ways
[1:08:17] unequal? I would like to take for a
[1:08:19] thought
[1:08:20] today. That's not fair.
[1:08:29] This thought has been on my heart, on my
[1:08:31] mind for some
[1:08:33] months. And I briefly mentioned it last
[1:08:37] year when I was in Indiana. And I
[1:08:40] started talking about the phrase, "He's
[1:08:43] the fairest of 10,000 to my soul." And
[1:08:47] when we hear the phrase like that, we
[1:08:50] start thinking about the fairy tale. Uh,
[1:08:53] I think it was Snow White and the Seven
[1:08:56] Dwarfs. It's been too long since I've
[1:08:58] read that. Where that the the wicked
[1:09:01] stepmother, she looked in the mirror and
[1:09:03] she said, "Mirror, mirror on the wall,
[1:09:07] who's the fairest of them all?" And for
[1:09:11] quite some time, the mirror would answer
[1:09:13] back that she was. But then one day,
[1:09:16] there was another one. the voice came
[1:09:18] back and told her that there was another
[1:09:20] more beautiful or more fair woman in the
[1:09:23] kingdom. That's a fairy tale. And and
[1:09:26] that's that's where we go kind of when
[1:09:29] we hear the word fair or the fairest of
[1:09:32] 10,000. But today I want to approach it
[1:09:35] in a little bit different manner when we
[1:09:38] use the phrase that's not fair.
[1:09:46] But I want to start out with the phrase
[1:09:48] once again. He is the
[1:09:51] fairest of 10,000
[1:09:55] to my
[1:09:56] soul. He's the
[1:09:59] fairest of any person of any entity in
[1:10:03] this life. He is the fairest one. You
[1:10:07] will find nobody that is more fair than
[1:10:10] the Lord Jesus Christ. We look through
[1:10:13] the scripture and we see that we could
[1:10:17] take story after story and and and I
[1:10:20] just want to take one for the moment and
[1:10:23] that is
[1:10:25] Jonah. Jonah was a man that was called
[1:10:28] by God. Anybody in this place would say
[1:10:31] I'm called by the Lord.
[1:10:34] It doesn't necessarily mean that you
[1:10:37] have a preaching ministry, a a ministry
[1:10:40] in the pullpit, a singing ministry, any
[1:10:42] of that. But you're called by the Lord.
[1:10:44] You're called out of darkness and into
[1:10:48] the marvelous light of the glorious
[1:10:51] gospel of Jesus Christ. You are the
[1:10:54] called according to his purpose.
[1:11:00] You have been called as Jonah was. Jonah
[1:11:03] was a prophet. Jonah was a man called of
[1:11:06] the Lord. And the the the scripture
[1:11:09] tells us that Jonah was called down to
[1:11:12] Nineveh. The Lord wanted Jonah to
[1:11:15] prophesy to Nineveh. And I can imagine
[1:11:18] that that was some of the words that
[1:11:20] came out of Jonah's mouth. That's not
[1:11:23] fair. Why don't you send somebody else?
[1:11:30] And so Jonah because of his condition at
[1:11:35] that moment when he said, "Lord, that's
[1:11:38] not fair." He decided that he was going
[1:11:41] to go in another
[1:11:42] direction. And when he went in another
[1:11:45] direction, he went down to Japa. And he
[1:11:48] was going to get on a ship to Tarses.
[1:11:50] And when he gets on the ship to Tarses,
[1:11:52] he was tired of saying, "That's not
[1:11:54] fair." And so he went down into the
[1:11:56] bottom of the boat. and he went to
[1:11:58] sleep.
[1:12:01] And the winds and the waves began to
[1:12:03] batter the ship. And they started
[1:12:05] calling on their gods. And as they
[1:12:08] called on their gods, they realized
[1:12:10] there was another man on the ship. And
[1:12:12] the dude was sleeping downstairs. And
[1:12:14] they woe down to get him and say, "You
[1:12:16] better call on your god. We're in a heap
[1:12:19] of trouble."
[1:12:23] And as many times as Jonah may have
[1:12:26] screamed to the Lord, "That's not
[1:12:29] fair." He said, "I'm your trouble."
[1:12:36] Many times we know that we
[1:12:40] are the
[1:12:42] trouble. Yet all the time we're
[1:12:45] screaming, "That's not fair.
[1:12:49] So
[1:12:50] Jonah, he told these men, he says, "I
[1:12:54] know I'm the reason that this ship is in
[1:12:56] the in the fix that it's in right now,
[1:12:59] and you're just going to have to throw
[1:13:01] me
[1:13:03] overboard." Well, we can't do
[1:13:06] that. Why? The lawyers back home, they
[1:13:11] they'll they'll be on us like
[1:13:14] everything. If we throw you overboard
[1:13:16] and we cut, we don't get you and we get
[1:13:18] to the next destination and the manifest
[1:13:21] says that there's a Jonah on this ship
[1:13:24] and there's no Jonah to be seen and
[1:13:27] because we've thrown you overboard, what
[1:13:29] are we going to tell them? Then we're
[1:13:31] going to have lawyers all over us
[1:13:32] because we've thrown you overboard. No,
[1:13:34] we can't do
[1:13:37] that. Come on. I'm just putting it in
[1:13:39] modern day, the way people act modern
[1:13:42] day. Okay.
[1:13:44] That's that's the way things happen. We
[1:13:46] got the ambulance chasers. We've got the
[1:13:48] lawyers. We we you know, not realizing
[1:13:52] that Jonah
[1:13:54] himself, he knew that he was the
[1:13:57] trouble. He knew that he was the reason
[1:14:00] the ship was about to sink. And he
[1:14:02] finally persuaded these men. They they
[1:14:05] had enough gumption about them that they
[1:14:08] didn't want to lose their own lives. And
[1:14:10] so they threw him overboard. Right now,
[1:14:15] you think about all of the talk, all of
[1:14:18] the hashing out. No, we can't throw you
[1:14:20] overboard. Let's call on our gods a
[1:14:22] little while longer. All of this is
[1:14:25] happening. I don't know the span of
[1:14:27] time, but you just remember that God had
[1:14:30] a fish prepared
[1:14:33] and God had the coordinates of where
[1:14:36] that fish would be and where the boat
[1:14:39] would be. He had it all prepared so that
[1:14:42] when Jonah went overboard at the precise
[1:14:46] moment that Jonah would be thrown
[1:14:48] overboard that the that the fish would
[1:14:51] be at the right coordinates and the boat
[1:14:53] would be at the right coordinates so
[1:14:56] that the the the Jonah and the fish
[1:14:58] could make the match. They could they
[1:15:01] they could meet up.
[1:15:05] It was all orchestrated in the purposes
[1:15:08] of God because he had a runaway prophet.
[1:15:13] And so he had this fish prepared. And as
[1:15:16] this
[1:15:17] fish grabs Jonah, Jonah is in the belly
[1:15:22] of this fish for three
[1:15:24] days. Did it take three days to get to
[1:15:27] the destination? Were they that far from
[1:15:29] Nineveh that it took three days for the
[1:15:32] fish to swim that far? Did it take three
[1:15:34] days before Jonah would repent and it
[1:15:37] was just a few miles and the fish didn't
[1:15:39] take three? I don't know any of that.
[1:15:41] All I know is that the fish got Jonah
[1:15:44] where he needed to be.
[1:15:48] And when he
[1:15:50] got puked up on the shores of Nineveh,
[1:15:55] I'm sorry, I couldn't think of another
[1:15:57] word.
[1:16:03] When he got spit up on the shores of
[1:16:09] Nineveh, Jonah went and he preached to
[1:16:14] the citizens of Nineveh. And
[1:16:17] Nineveh repented.
[1:16:22] What was Moses's message? If you don't
[1:16:25] repent, God's going to burn this city
[1:16:27] down.
[1:16:28] He's going to wipe this city off. That
[1:16:31] was his message to them. And the the
[1:16:33] response of the people was repentance.
[1:16:38] Sackloth and ashes. I believe that it
[1:16:40] even said that the cattle had sackcloth
[1:16:43] on it. They were repenting. There was a
[1:16:46] spirit of repentance in Nineveh that the
[1:16:49] people would begin to repent in such a
[1:16:53] way. And then Jonah's back to this.
[1:16:57] That's not
[1:17:01] fair. I didn't want to come because I
[1:17:04] knew that you were a gracious and a
[1:17:06] merciful God and if they would repent
[1:17:08] that you would repent of the evil that
[1:17:10] you had for this city. And here they've
[1:17:13] repented. I knew that's the way it was
[1:17:14] going to be. That's not fair.
[1:17:21] And God had to work with Jonah some
[1:17:23] more, giving him a place of shade and
[1:17:26] then taking that shade away and and
[1:17:28] Jonah complaining about it. And see this
[1:17:31] this we can put oursel in the picture.
[1:17:35] We can put ourself in the picture
[1:17:37] because we're constantly using that
[1:17:40] phrase, it's not fair.
[1:17:43] You with children hear it probably
[1:17:45] frequently. It's not fair. He got by
[1:17:49] with it. I didn't. It's not fair. He has
[1:17:52] to He He doesn't have to take out the
[1:17:54] garbage. I do. It's not fair. And this
[1:17:57] is a phrase that bleeds over into our
[1:17:59] walk with the Lord.
[1:18:02] That's not
[1:18:04] fair. Turn with me if you will to the
[1:18:07] New Testament.
[1:18:25] Now, as we read Matthew chapter 20, we
[1:18:29] want to remember that Matthew chapter
[1:18:33] 19, Jesus has just met this rich young
[1:18:37] man who came to him and asked him, what
[1:18:43] must I do to receive eternal
[1:18:48] life? And Jesus tells
[1:18:52] him, "Keep this commandment. Keep this
[1:18:55] commandment. Keep this commandment. Keep
[1:18:56] this commandment." And the young man
[1:19:00] says, "I've done all of that from my
[1:19:03] youth up."
[1:19:07] And Jesus
[1:19:09] said, "Well, that's good, but one thing
[1:19:13] you
[1:19:14] lack. Sell all that you
[1:19:18] have and give it to the
[1:19:21] poor." And the man went away
[1:19:25] sorrowful because he had big riches.
[1:19:30] And he apparently loved his
[1:19:33] riches more than a desire of eternal
[1:19:40] life. He went away
[1:19:43] sorrowful. And after he went
[1:19:46] away and was sorrowful, the disciples
[1:19:49] heard it and they were exceedingly
[1:19:53] amazed. And they asked Jesus, "Who can
[1:19:56] be saved?" And Jesus said, "With men
[1:19:58] it's impossible, but with God all things
[1:20:01] are possible, but I want you to I I know
[1:20:04] that I didn't give it to them, but I
[1:20:06] want to look at verse 27 of chapter 19."
[1:20:09] Then answered Peter and said unto him,
[1:20:13] "Behold, we have forsaken all and
[1:20:17] followed
[1:20:18] you. What shall we have?"
[1:20:23] Therefore, now we're leading up to
[1:20:25] something in chapter 20. So just just
[1:20:28] bear with me here. Jesus has spoken to
[1:20:32] this rich young ruler and the the rich
[1:20:36] young ruler asked him, "What do I have
[1:20:40] to do to have eternal
[1:20:43] life?" And Jesus gave him some
[1:20:48] commandments that were a part of the
[1:20:50] law.
[1:20:52] and and he answers back, "That's no
[1:20:56] problem. I got that under my belt. I I
[1:20:59] that that's all that's all handled. I've
[1:21:02] done that from the time I was a child."
[1:21:07] But Jesus gave him something
[1:21:10] else.
[1:21:12] That was not what he was
[1:21:16] expecting when he told him, "Sell
[1:21:20] everything that you have and give it to
[1:21:23] the poor and then you'll have eternal
[1:21:25] life." And he went away sad.
[1:21:28] Now Peter and the disciples are watching
[1:21:31] all of this and they realize that they
[1:21:36] probably kept the
[1:21:37] commandments as that young man
[1:21:41] did and they had gone the step
[1:21:45] further. They
[1:21:48] had left everything
[1:21:51] behind. all of their
[1:21:54] jobs, their boats, their fishing gear,
[1:21:58] they left it all behind to go and follow
[1:22:02] Jesus. And he says, "What about
[1:22:07] us? We've forsaken all. What do we have
[1:22:11] therefore?" So then let's pick it up in
[1:22:14] chapter 20 verse one.
[1:22:17] For the kingdom of heaven, Jesus
[1:22:19] speaking, for the kingdom of heaven is
[1:22:21] like a man that is an
[1:22:27] householder. This would be easier to
[1:22:29] read in the
[1:22:31] amplified because it would expound
[1:22:35] more
[1:22:37] on some of these
[1:22:39] words. So, I'm going to expound for you.
[1:22:43] The kingdom of heaven is like a man who
[1:22:46] is a landowner, a
[1:22:49] householder, which went out early in the
[1:22:53] morning to hire
[1:22:55] laborers in his
[1:22:58] vineyard. Now, this man apparently
[1:23:02] had plenty of
[1:23:05] vines that needed either to be pruned or
[1:23:09] the grapes picked. This doesn't
[1:23:12] necessarily say here what they were
[1:23:15] doing, but he needed laborers in his
[1:23:18] vineyard. And so it was early in the
[1:23:21] morning. We're going to say that the day
[1:23:24] started about 6:00 in the morning, about
[1:23:27] dawn. So this landowner goes and he's
[1:23:31] looking for some workers for his
[1:23:34] vineyard. Now, let's just say that he
[1:23:38] went down to the local 7-Eleven or the
[1:23:42] local uh uh Circle
[1:23:45] K where the laborers stand to wait for
[1:23:49] somebody to come and pick them up and
[1:23:51] take them to a job. Okay, this is a
[1:23:55] whole different scenario than what it is
[1:23:57] today. In modern day, we work on one
[1:24:00] week or two week uh uh pay periods or uh
[1:24:04] get paid every month. But in this day,
[1:24:07] they got paid by the day. That was
[1:24:09] according to the Levitical law. They had
[1:24:12] to be paid every day. So staff zone is
[1:24:17] not a new
[1:24:21] concept. Staff zone is actually a
[1:24:23] Levitical concept. Get paid by the day.
[1:24:27] So this land owner, he goes out and he
[1:24:32] goes to the
[1:24:33] marketplace and he's looking for
[1:24:37] workers. As he's looking for workers,
[1:24:39] the Bible says, "When he had agreed with
[1:24:44] the laborers for a penny a day, he sent
[1:24:48] them into his vineyard."
[1:24:51] Now again, our modern thinking when we
[1:24:55] think about a
[1:24:58] penny, it is
[1:25:01] worthless. In fact, they're going to
[1:25:03] quit making them because they take
[1:25:05] nearly three cents to make a
[1:25:08] penny and do away with it. So if you
[1:25:12] look in the Greek lexicon at the word
[1:25:15] penny, it is
[1:25:18] daenarius which is how the amplified
[1:25:22] translates it. How the new king James,
[1:25:24] how the NASB, that's how they translate
[1:25:27] it. That is the Greek word
[1:25:29] daenerius. That is the equivalent of a
[1:25:33] full day's wage.
[1:25:37] So you got to get penny out of your
[1:25:41] mind. I want you to think about a day's
[1:25:44] wage. If you think about minimum wage at
[1:25:49] uh
[1:25:50] $7.50, I think still an hour, and you
[1:25:53] multiply that by 12, that would be your
[1:25:57] wage for the day. So that was the agreed
[1:26:01] upon wage for these workers.
[1:26:05] Now I want to look here at the word they
[1:26:10] agreed. He had agreed with the
[1:26:16] laborers. This gives an implication that
[1:26:19] there was some some going on. There was
[1:26:22] some negotiation that was going on for
[1:26:26] the wage that between the the laborer
[1:26:30] and the landowner. There was some
[1:26:33] negotiation between them and that word
[1:26:38] agreed in the Greek is symphoness
[1:26:42] symphonio.
[1:26:43] Symphonio and that is to agree together
[1:26:47] and it comes from another Greek word
[1:26:51] symphonos meaning
[1:26:53] harmonious
[1:26:55] accordant
[1:26:57] agreeing things agreed upon or sounding
[1:27:01] together. So when he had come into a
[1:27:05] symphony with them, when he had come
[1:27:09] into a harmonious sound with
[1:27:13] them, they agreed to
[1:27:16] it. Perhaps he gave a wage and they
[1:27:20] countered with another wage. We don't
[1:27:22] exactly know, but they came into an
[1:27:25] agreement on this wage. And then he sent
[1:27:29] them into a
[1:27:32] vineyard. Now you got to keep that in
[1:27:34] mind. They agreed to the
[1:27:39] wage. Verse three. And when he went out
[1:27:42] about the third
[1:27:44] hour, that would be 9
[1:27:48] a.m. and saw others standing idle in the
[1:27:53] marketplace.
[1:27:55] He said unto them, "Go into the vineyard
[1:27:58] vineyard, and whatsoever is right, I
[1:28:02] will give you." And they went their
[1:28:05] way. No agreed on
[1:28:10] price.
[1:28:11] Again, he went
[1:28:13] out about
[1:28:16] noon, 6th hour, and about
[1:28:20] 3:00, the 9th hour, and did
[1:28:25] likewise. No agreed upon price.
[1:28:31] And about the 11th
[1:28:33] hour he went out and found others
[1:28:37] standing idle and said unto them, "Why
[1:28:41] are you standing here all day
[1:28:43] idle?" Now, when I read this and I think
[1:28:48] about the guys standing down at Circle K
[1:28:51] gas station on Victory Drive on Monday
[1:28:54] morning waiting for somebody to come
[1:28:56] along and hire them.
[1:28:59] My mind thinks
[1:29:01] about where were these guys at
[1:29:08] 6:00? Where were these guys at
[1:29:16] 9:00? That 9:00 hour would be
[1:29:20] me, not six o'clock. 9:00 would be me.
[1:29:27] What about the folks at
[1:29:29] noon or
[1:29:32] 3:00? Where were they
[1:29:36] when the
[1:29:38] landowner went down to the local Circle
[1:29:41] K and was inquiring about day
[1:29:45] laborers? Where were they? We don't
[1:29:50] know. But they
[1:29:52] apparently he he chided them. Why are
[1:29:55] you standing here all day
[1:29:57] idle? And they came back and they said,
[1:30:01] "No man hired
[1:30:03] us." Well, it seems that this guy was
[1:30:07] here at
[1:30:08] 6:00. He was here at
[1:30:11] 9:00,
[1:30:12] 12:00,
[1:30:14] 3:00. Where were
[1:30:17] you? Were you inside getting a soda?
[1:30:22] Were you out back taking a smoke break?
[1:30:26] Where were
[1:30:29] you? None of you better be taking a
[1:30:31] smoke
[1:30:34] break. I'm talking about
[1:30:38] 7-Eleven and the day
[1:30:41] laborers. All right. So when
[1:30:43] when no man has hired us, he said unto
[1:30:47] them, "Go ye also into the vineyard, and
[1:30:51] whatsoever is right, that shall you
[1:30:54] receive." Now, I want to stop here just
[1:30:56] a minute because I want you to
[1:30:59] notice that the first group that went in
[1:31:02] at
[1:31:03] 6:00, they came into a harmony with the
[1:31:06] landowner.
[1:31:10] symphonos. They came into an agreement
[1:31:13] with him about how much that they would
[1:31:16] be
[1:31:18] paid. But all of the other groups when
[1:31:22] they were
[1:31:23] hired, there was no negotiation. They
[1:31:27] simply went out of trust that the
[1:31:30] landowner was going to be fair with
[1:31:32] them.
[1:31:34] That's it.
[1:31:38] So when they came that were
[1:31:41] hired or verse eight, when they when
[1:31:44] even was come, the Lord of the vineyard
[1:31:46] saith to his
[1:31:48] steward, his manager, call the laborers,
[1:31:52] and give them their hire, beginning from
[1:31:56] the last unto the
[1:32:02] first. That's not fair.
[1:32:08] It seems to me if I've been the one in
[1:32:11] the field the longest, I ought to be
[1:32:13] able to get my pay and go home and
[1:32:15] relax.
[1:32:25] So when they
[1:32:26] came that were hired at the 11th
[1:32:31] hour, that would be 5:00 in the
[1:32:35] afternoon. To us, that is quitting time.
[1:32:39] But in this case, there was one more
[1:32:41] hour to labor.
[1:32:45] Now, I
[1:32:48] have
[1:32:49] spent
[1:32:51] one small section of a day in a
[1:32:57] vineyard. And I know how exhausting it
[1:33:01] could be if you're picking the
[1:33:04] grapes, clipping them, getting them into
[1:33:07] the baskets, carrying them where they
[1:33:10] need to go, being dirty and sticky and
[1:33:13] no water to wash your hands and and and
[1:33:16] just constant labor as you're going
[1:33:18] along. Now, these have been in the field
[1:33:20] since 6:00 in the morning, but they were
[1:33:24] not the first ones to be called to be
[1:33:26] paid.
[1:33:29] When they came that were hired about the
[1:33:32] 11th hour, they received every man a
[1:33:37] daenarius, a penny, a daenarius, a full
[1:33:40] day's
[1:33:45] wage. That's not fair.
[1:33:52] But when the first
[1:33:55] came, they
[1:33:57] supposed that they should have received
[1:34:00] more, and they likewise received every
[1:34:04] man a penny, a daenarius, a full day's
[1:34:07] wage.
[1:34:12] Now, I want you to
[1:34:15] notice they had come into harmony or
[1:34:18] agreement with the landowner before they
[1:34:21] ever started
[1:34:24] working. But when it came time to be
[1:34:27] paid and they started this comparison
[1:34:32] thing from people that worked only one
[1:34:35] hour, maybe only three hours, maybe only
[1:34:38] five hours, and they had been there for
[1:34:40] the full 12
[1:34:41] hours, but they had been in symphonos.
[1:34:46] They had been in agreement with the
[1:34:48] landowner about a price. But when they
[1:34:51] saw others getting exactly what they had
[1:34:54] agreed upon, they began to say within
[1:34:58] themselves, "That's not fair." And they
[1:35:01] thought, they
[1:35:05] supposed added to their pay because they
[1:35:08] had been in the field all day
[1:35:13] long. And they likewise received every
[1:35:17] man a penny, a daenerius, the same wage
[1:35:22] that they agreed
[1:35:26] upon. And
[1:35:29] when they had received
[1:35:32] it, what did they start
[1:35:35] doing? They started
[1:35:39] murmuring against the good man or the
[1:35:42] landowner of the house.
[1:35:46] saying, "These last have wrought but one
[1:35:49] hour, and you made them equal to us,
[1:35:53] which have borne the burden and heat of
[1:35:57] the day." Now I want you to see that
[1:36:00] they when they murmured the Greek word
[1:36:04] is
[1:36:05] gonguzo meaning to murmur or to mutter
[1:36:09] or to say
[1:36:12] anything
[1:36:14] against in a low
[1:36:16] [Music]
[1:36:20] tone. I don't know about this guy.
[1:36:26] He brought them in at 3:00 and he gave
[1:36:28] them the same wage you gave
[1:36:32] us. I just don't know about this guy. He
[1:36:35] just don't seem to be too
[1:36:47] fair. The
[1:36:49] landowner had agreed.
[1:36:53] They had
[1:36:55] agreed to a
[1:36:57] price.
[1:37:00] And when they did
[1:37:03] not, as they supposed in their mind,
[1:37:06] when they did not get a little extra
[1:37:10] added to it, they began to
[1:37:13] murmur and to complain that this
[1:37:17] landowner wasn't exactly as fair as he
[1:37:21] seemed to be.
[1:37:22] Now you think about earlier in the day
[1:37:24] when the the agreement was
[1:37:27] made, it gives no indication that they
[1:37:31] were upset with the wage that he offered
[1:37:34] them. There's no indication that they
[1:37:36] were uh mad because that he undercut the
[1:37:40] the fair wage of the day. He they came
[1:37:43] to the agreement of the wage and and
[1:37:46] they agreed to it and went to work, but
[1:37:49] they didn't know the rest of the story.
[1:37:54] This is where you and where I are
[1:37:58] sometimes in the same position as these
[1:38:01] that were hired at 6:00 in the
[1:38:05] morning because we did not know the
[1:38:08] whole
[1:38:09] story when we started this journey. We
[1:38:13] came into a symphony into a symphos with
[1:38:16] with with the Lord Jesus Christ. We came
[1:38:20] into an agreement with him and we said
[1:38:22] to the Lord, I will follow you and I
[1:38:25] will pay the price whatever it is.
[1:38:34] And we fought through hell and we fought
[1:38:36] through high water and and we worked and
[1:38:39] we labored and we kept the standard and
[1:38:42] we lifted up the standard and we kept
[1:38:44] all the rules. And
[1:38:47] then somebody came at
[1:38:50] noon and it didn't seem like that they
[1:38:53] had to keep the rules that we had to
[1:38:58] keep. And we started
[1:39:03] murmuring. We thought we were murmuring
[1:39:06] against the preacher when indeed we were
[1:39:09] murmuring against the one who called us.
[1:39:11] Right.
[1:39:15] But we were the ones that made the
[1:39:17] agreement to start with, but there we
[1:39:20] are screaming, "It's not fair."
[1:39:23] They didn't have it as hard as we had
[1:39:25] it.
[1:39:29] Oh
[1:39:32] friends, we have to get over this that's
[1:39:37] not fair attitude in the end time
[1:39:40] because there are a lot of things that
[1:39:42] don't seem fair.
[1:39:46] And let let's start comparing some
[1:39:48] words. Fair simply means
[1:39:54] even. And when we look at somebody that
[1:39:57] maybe has not had to pay as high of a
[1:40:00] price as we've had to pay and we start
[1:40:02] saying that's not fair. Well, we're not
[1:40:04] talking about fair. What's fair today?
[1:40:07] We're talking about our God who is just.
[1:40:11] He is a just God. The book of Revelation
[1:40:14] 15 said they sang a song of Moses and
[1:40:18] they said just and true are you, oh God.
[1:40:22] That means that when he does anything,
[1:40:25] he is absolutely right.
[1:40:31] He's not right based on my thought of
[1:40:34] right. He's not right based on your
[1:40:37] thought of right. He's just right.
[1:40:41] And when he is right, that's it.
[1:40:48] He doesn't care about
[1:40:50] fair because he realizes that he chose
[1:40:56] you before the foundation of the world
[1:41:00] that you would be holy and without blame
[1:41:03] before him in love. And he didn't call
[1:41:07] you to be holy and without blame before
[1:41:09] him in love in the in the
[1:41:12] Philadelphiaian age or in the Ephesus
[1:41:14] age. He called you to be holy and
[1:41:17] without blame before him in love in
[1:41:20] Leodysia.
[1:41:24] And he knew that he was going to put you
[1:41:27] in Leodysia because he knew what he was
[1:41:29] going to put inside of you. That you
[1:41:33] could overcome the spirit of the age.
[1:41:36] And the spirit of the age is constantly
[1:41:39] crying. That's not fair.
[1:41:47] Because the spirit of the age is
[1:41:51] people's
[1:41:57] rights. We've said it before, we say it
[1:42:00] again. We live in America. We want our
[1:42:02] rights.
[1:42:04] We want our right to own a gun. We want
[1:42:07] our right to carry it wherever we want
[1:42:09] to. We want a right. We we want our
[1:42:12] rights to have a car. We want to have
[1:42:14] our rights to have a big car or a big
[1:42:18] truck. And we want it to be we want our
[1:42:22] right with our car to be that it can be
[1:42:26] any size engine that it wants to be that
[1:42:29] we want it to
[1:42:32] be. And we want our right to have it as
[1:42:35] loud as we want it to be.
[1:42:40] Not me. I want it
[1:42:42] quiet. But there's some that they want
[1:42:45] it
[1:42:47] loud. Mostly the Dodge
[1:42:51] owners. The Dodge owners with the diesel
[1:42:55] engines and the big tailpipes. They want
[1:42:58] their
[1:42:59] rights. And they want their
[1:43:02] right to charcoal your window as they go
[1:43:05] by you when they step on the
[1:43:07] accelerator.
[1:43:10] But it's a right because they're an
[1:43:12] American
[1:43:14] citizen. But God called you and he
[1:43:16] called me to a higher level uh than an
[1:43:19] American citizen. And he called me
[1:43:22] higher than the level of Leodysia. He
[1:43:24] said, "Come out from among her and be
[1:43:27] separate, say the Lord." He was talking
[1:43:29] about the modern-day church. But the
[1:43:31] modern-day church is in Leodysia.
[1:43:33] They're steeped in Leodysia. and he's
[1:43:36] calling to us, come out from among her
[1:43:39] and be separate, sayeth the Lord. I
[1:43:41] didn't call you to be like her.
[1:43:46] And then we start throwing up our hands
[1:43:48] and say, "That's not
[1:43:56] fair." And then God calls you to a
[1:43:58] higher level. He calls you to a truth.
[1:44:01] He calls you out of Babylon. He calls
[1:44:03] you out of the Roman system.
[1:44:07] And as he calls you out of the Roman
[1:44:09] system, he begins to lay down some
[1:44:12] things that he doesn't like about the
[1:44:14] Roman system.
[1:44:16] And he calls you even higher. And he
[1:44:18] says, "Come up higher."
[1:44:22] And because it's things that we're
[1:44:24] attached
[1:44:25] to, things that we love, things that we
[1:44:28] desire, we have the taste for them. We
[1:44:32] start screaming, "But Lord, that's not
[1:44:34] fair. All the other churches do it."
[1:44:43] But that isn't who God called you to be.
[1:44:44] He didn't call you to be all the other
[1:44:46] churches.
[1:44:47] Do you realize as much as God put the
[1:44:50] coordinates together for Jonah and the
[1:44:53] fish
[1:44:55] that God put your coordinates together?
[1:45:02] of all the churches in all of the
[1:45:07] world. Why do I have to be in Smith
[1:45:10] Station,
[1:45:14] Alabama? It's just not fair.
[1:45:17] Lord, my friends are in places where the
[1:45:20] grass is green and it's fun to walk
[1:45:23] through in your bare feet and you put me
[1:45:25] in Alabama where the grass is prickly.
[1:45:31] And not only that, Lord, it's not fair
[1:45:33] because all of the dirt is red and you
[1:45:36] can't grow a
[1:45:39] garden. And all my friends are in places
[1:45:42] that have black dirt and they grow
[1:45:44] beautiful
[1:45:47] gardens. It's not fair,
[1:45:52] Lord. God had your coordinates picked
[1:45:54] out.
[1:45:59] In the natural, as unfair as it seems in
[1:46:03] a in a human
[1:46:06] standpoint, God is the fairest of
[1:46:09] 10,000.
[1:46:12] When he placed you at the coordinates
[1:46:16] that he placed you at in Smith Station,
[1:46:19] Alabama, it was because he knew what he
[1:46:22] had placed inside of you and it had to
[1:46:26] come out.
[1:46:28] And he knew what you had inside of you
[1:46:32] would not come to its full manifestation
[1:46:36] if he put you in green grass.
[1:46:41] and black
[1:46:46] dirt. Yet, we end
[1:46:49] up talking to the
[1:46:53] landowner the same way that the 6:00 in
[1:46:57] the morning people talk to the
[1:46:59] landowner. It's just not
[1:47:02] fair. He didn't tell me the whole story
[1:47:05] when he called me on this journey.
[1:47:09] I agreed to a
[1:47:12] wage, but he didn't tell me that other
[1:47:15] people were going to be able to be in a
[1:47:17] place where there was greener
[1:47:20] grass and blacker
[1:47:23] dirt and I had to be here in this red
[1:47:26] dirt. My kids are all the time coming in
[1:47:29] with red
[1:47:30] clothes. It just ain't fair.
[1:47:44] This is our murmurings.
[1:47:52] Be
[1:47:53] content with such things as you
[1:47:56] have. For he has said, "I will never
[1:47:59] leave you and I will never forsake you."
[1:48:04] He didn't tell you all of the story. He
[1:48:08] didn't tell you all of the turns in the
[1:48:10] road. He didn't tell you all of the
[1:48:12] snares that would come your way
[1:48:15] when you agreed and said, "Lord, I'll
[1:48:18] follow you. Whatever the cost,
[1:48:23] I'll follow you, Lord. Wherever you take
[1:48:26] me, whatever it cost you, I'll do it."
[1:48:32] Well, I didn't know you was going to
[1:48:33] call me to Alabama to red
[1:48:37] dirt. I didn't know you were going to
[1:48:39] call me to work outside in
[1:48:42] 95° weather all summer long. I didn't
[1:48:45] know that you were going to call me to
[1:48:47] do that.
[1:48:55] I want to tell you, God has given a
[1:48:57] great
[1:48:59] grace to me and to a lot of you that
[1:49:03] have to work
[1:49:04] outside. He's given us a lot of grace to
[1:49:08] be able to do that in this temperature
[1:49:12] and to be able to stay hydrated and be
[1:49:15] able to work in that kind of a
[1:49:17] condition. And and personally for me, it
[1:49:20] is not something that I complain about
[1:49:22] because I would rather be hot as be
[1:49:24] cold. I know that's foreign to some
[1:49:27] people, but I would rather sweat as to
[1:49:31] be cold. And and so I have no problem
[1:49:34] being out in in in the in the hot and
[1:49:37] and doing that. But there are other
[1:49:39] things that we have encountered along
[1:49:41] our life that we didn't when we agreed
[1:49:45] when we came into symphony when we came
[1:49:48] into a harmony with the Lord Jesus when
[1:49:51] we first got born again.
[1:49:54] We didn't know what we were going to
[1:49:56] face.
[1:49:59] All that mattered at that moment was,
[1:50:03] I've got to come into agreement with the
[1:50:06] Lord because I want to be saved.
[1:50:11] And so we agreed with him and we said,
[1:50:13] "Lord, we'll go with you.
[1:50:16] Just save me and fill me with the Holy
[1:50:19] Ghost.
[1:50:21] And if you'll fill me with the Holy
[1:50:22] Ghost, I can encounter every anything
[1:50:25] and
[1:50:28] everything. And we can.
[1:50:31] And we have,
[1:50:34] but we've done it with some murmuring
[1:50:36] and throwing out, "Lord, that's not
[1:50:38] fair."
[1:50:43] But the landowner said, "Take what's
[1:50:46] yours and go your
[1:50:50] way. I'll give unto you. I I will give
[1:50:54] unto this last even as unto you. Is it
[1:50:57] not lawful for me to do what I will with
[1:51:00] mine own? Is thine eye evil because I am
[1:51:04] good?"
[1:51:06] So the last shall be first and the first
[1:51:08] last for many are called but few are
[1:51:11] chosen.
[1:51:13] I want you to notice verse 13 because he
[1:51:16] said he answered one of them and said
[1:51:18] friend I do no
[1:51:21] wrong and I I I I look at that word
[1:51:23] friend and in the book of
[1:51:27] Matthew it's used in very similar way
[1:51:31] three
[1:51:33] times
[1:51:37] and one of those times was when they
[1:51:40] came to take him to crucifixion iction
[1:51:42] and he called one of the soldiers
[1:51:45] friend. And I heard a heard a black
[1:51:49] preacher
[1:51:51] say Jesus was calling him friend in a
[1:51:54] nice nasty
[1:51:58] way. I I I I don't know because I don't
[1:52:01] think Jesus has any any wrong in
[1:52:05] him. But he he says, "I didn't do any
[1:52:09] wrong. You
[1:52:11] agreed. And that's the that's what he's
[1:52:14] saying to us today. I didn't do any
[1:52:16] wrong. You may be screaming, "It ain't
[1:52:19] fair, but I didn't do any wrong." That's
[1:52:22] right. You came into symphony. You came
[1:52:25] into a harmony with me. You agreed with
[1:52:28] me. And we've done it many times in our
[1:52:30] lives. We've come into harmony with him
[1:52:33] and then we fell out of harmony with him
[1:52:36] because we started saying that ain't
[1:52:39] fair. And and when when we start saying
[1:52:42] that ain't fair, we're doing the same
[1:52:44] thing that they did in the book of
[1:52:46] Ezekiel when Ezekiel was prophesying.
[1:52:49] We're telling God, you're not
[1:52:53] equal. You don't do things in an equal
[1:52:59] way. Yet God knows
[1:53:02] you and you and you and you and you and
[1:53:05] me. And he knows that the pressure for
[1:53:10] you is different than the pressure for
[1:53:12] me.
[1:53:14] He knows that the rebuke that's needed
[1:53:19] for you is different than what's needed
[1:53:22] for me. That's right. He knows that the
[1:53:25] guidance that's needed for you is
[1:53:28] different than the guidance for me. And
[1:53:31] so I don't have any right when I see him
[1:53:34] guiding you with a nice gentle hand
[1:53:41] and me he's slapping in the back of the
[1:53:44] head.
[1:53:50] I can't say that's not fair because I'm
[1:53:53] just going to tell you I've come along
[1:53:55] in this journey far enough to
[1:53:57] know that sometimes it's exactly what I
[1:54:01] need. It's the slap in the back of the
[1:54:03] head. That a nice gentle Come on now,
[1:54:06] son. Let's
[1:54:07] [Music]
[1:54:08] go. It's my desire to be led by his eye.
[1:54:14] But I don't always respond to his eye.
[1:54:19] So sometimes he has to take the
[1:54:21] shepherd's rod,
[1:54:23] kind of knock me in the back of the head
[1:54:25] or in the back of the
[1:54:27] knees, maybe a swat on the backside. I
[1:54:30] don't know. Sometimes it takes a little
[1:54:33] more to get me to move. But I can't just
[1:54:36] say because I made the agreement.
[1:54:40] You young people that sit among
[1:54:43] us, you started out the journey the same
[1:54:46] as we did, us older ones that have been
[1:54:49] on this journey for quite some years.
[1:54:52] And you started out and you just you
[1:54:55] just wanted to be
[1:54:59] right. You heard a preacher saying,
[1:55:01] "Repent of your sins." And you did it.
[1:55:06] And because you're young, you don't know
[1:55:08] the
[1:55:09] full scope of what your life is going to
[1:55:12] look like, the hard knocks that you
[1:55:13] might have. And God grant that you don't
[1:55:15] have to go through as many as I did.
[1:55:20] May the grace of
[1:55:23] God be to you that you will have
[1:55:28] listening
[1:55:29] ears, that you will have a listening
[1:55:32] heart, that you will have a tender
[1:55:35] heart, that you will respond to the Holy
[1:55:38] Ghost with more ease than what I do.
[1:55:41] Because in the end, if you belong to
[1:55:45] God, you ain't getting away.
[1:55:50] you're you're just not getting away from
[1:55:54] the Lord because he chose you and he's
[1:55:58] going to have you.
[1:56:00] You may even sit there today and say
[1:56:02] that's not fair.
[1:56:09] You hear stories about people that that
[1:56:12] that were called of God and they tried
[1:56:15] to run in the opposite
[1:56:17] direction and they would find themselves
[1:56:19] doing uh nasty stuff and they they would
[1:56:22] find themselves uh out drinking or doing
[1:56:25] whatever and and and trying to run from
[1:56:28] God as hard as they
[1:56:31] can and getting no enjoyment out of it
[1:56:34] because they know they're called of
[1:56:39] God. And so, young people, anytime we
[1:56:42] speak to you and say, "Follow Jesus with
[1:56:45] all your
[1:56:46] heart, we're just trying to keep you
[1:56:48] from some of the traps, trying to keep
[1:56:50] you from some of the scars that we have.
[1:56:53] We don't want you to carry them. We want
[1:56:54] you to go to a higher level than we've
[1:56:57] ever gone. And it's not because we want
[1:56:59] to hold you back from any uh fun that
[1:57:02] might be there. But the pleasures of sin
[1:57:04] only last for a season. That's right.
[1:57:07] They're not enduring. They're not going
[1:57:09] to endure all the way to the end.
[1:57:12] They're they're they're only going to
[1:57:13] last for a little while and then you've
[1:57:16] because you are called.
[1:57:20] Because you belong to the Lord.
[1:57:24] You see, there's some people here that
[1:57:27] have gotten a revelation of what a
[1:57:30] prophet said when he said, "Hold the
[1:57:33] token over your family."
[1:57:36] They got a revelation that that same God
[1:57:39] that saved them was able to save their
[1:57:42] children and their grandchildren and
[1:57:44] their great grandchildren. They got a
[1:57:46] revelation of it. And so they they
[1:57:49] faithfully hold the token over their
[1:57:51] family. You say, "Preacher, what does
[1:57:53] that look like?" Well, I don't know
[1:57:55] exactly, but I do know that when I pray
[1:57:58] and I ask the Lord to watch over my
[1:58:00] children and guide them in the truth,
[1:58:03] guide them in the way of righteousness
[1:58:05] and holiness and and that they will walk
[1:58:08] in everything that God has called them
[1:58:10] to, I hold it up to God. Yes.
[1:58:16] I don't have the
[1:58:19] power to make my children walk right.
[1:58:24] You don't either.
[1:58:27] When they're in your
[1:58:28] house, you have the power to guide them.
[1:58:32] That's to nurture them. That's why
[1:58:36] daddies, it's important for you to
[1:58:38] nurture your
[1:58:40] children with the word and not the
[1:58:42] television. You got to nurture them in
[1:58:45] the things of God so that they when the
[1:58:48] as they're growing up, their thirst is
[1:58:50] not for the world because that's so much
[1:58:52] of what they seen. But their thirst is
[1:58:55] for the things of God because that's
[1:58:57] what's been held before them. hold
[1:58:59] before them words of life so that they
[1:59:02] can have a hunger for the things of
[1:59:07] God. But once they leave your
[1:59:12] house, you can say things to them, but
[1:59:16] you don't have the power to change them.
[1:59:18] You don't have the power to make them
[1:59:20] walk right. You don't have the power to
[1:59:23] make them do right.
[1:59:27] The authority that you have as a parent
[1:59:32] and as a believer is that you can hold
[1:59:35] the token over them because you believe
[1:59:39] that the same God who saved you is more
[1:59:42] than able to save them and deliver them
[1:59:46] and fill them with the Holy Ghost and
[1:59:48] cause them to walk in the right
[1:59:50] direction to walk toward truth or in
[1:59:53] truth. that God has that power.
[2:00:13] Something my wife said earlier spurred
[2:00:15] me to look this because when we think
[2:00:19] about
[2:00:20] grace, we think of unmmerited
[2:00:24] favor. But I just want to read you the
[2:00:26] definition of
[2:00:28] grace from the Strong's lexicon.
[2:00:32] When you read in the scripture where it
[2:00:34] says, "Grace be to you and peace from
[2:00:36] God our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[2:00:38] Christ." You know, that's a phrase that
[2:00:40] a lot of times we skip over. But let's
[2:00:42] just let's just think about what he's
[2:00:46] offering to us.
[2:00:49] Grace, that which affords
[2:00:52] joy,
[2:00:54] pleasure,
[2:00:56] delight,
[2:00:57] sweetness,
[2:00:59] charm,
[2:01:01] loveliness, grace of
[2:01:04] speech,
[2:01:06] goodwill, loving
[2:01:08] kindness,
[2:01:10] favor of the merciful kindness by which
[2:01:14] God exerting his holy influence upon on
[2:01:18] souls, turns them to Christ,
[2:01:22] keeps,
[2:01:24] strengthens, increases them in Christian
[2:01:27] faith, knowledge, affection, and kindles
[2:01:30] them to the exercise of the Christian
[2:01:35] virtues. What is due to grace? The
[2:01:38] spiritual condition of one governed by
[2:01:41] the power of divine grace. The token or
[2:01:46] proof of grace,
[2:01:49] benefit, a gift of grace, benefit,
[2:01:54] bounty, thanks for benefits, services,
[2:01:57] favors,
[2:02:00] recompense, reward. That is the Greek
[2:02:03] number 5485. If you want to look it up
[2:02:06] for yourself,
[2:02:09] charice 5485.
[2:02:11] So when we talk about grace that is
[2:02:14] afforded to us, it is not
[2:02:18] just unmmerited favor, but it's
[2:02:21] unmmerited of favor. Unmmerited favor
[2:02:25] that which affords joy, pleasure,
[2:02:28] delight, sweetness, charm, loveliness,
[2:02:32] and grace of speech. And so when we know
[2:02:36] that we have we we were we were called
[2:02:39] and we may have been the 6 a.m. ones
[2:02:42] that went into the vineyard. There are
[2:02:45] probably, you know, in classification
[2:02:47] there's some that have been serving the
[2:02:49] Lord longer than others, some that have
[2:02:51] been in the vineyard longer than others.
[2:02:54] And
[2:02:55] we
[2:02:58] have a a sense
[2:03:00] of
[2:03:06] seniority. They just don't know what
[2:03:09] we've been
[2:03:12] through. They think they have it so bad.
[2:03:16] And they just don't know what we've been
[2:03:18] through.
[2:03:23] Oh, don't look so
[2:03:27] holy. I ain't the only one that's ever
[2:03:30] said that under my breath.
[2:03:37] And we've got to get rid of that
[2:03:39] seniority, superiority,
[2:03:45] attitude because when it all comes down
[2:03:47] to
[2:03:49] it, this is not a wage that we are
[2:03:53] serving the Lord
[2:03:55] for. In the book of Matthew, it was a
[2:03:58] wage that they had agreed upon.
[2:04:01] But I'm not serving the Lord for a wage.
[2:04:05] The Bible says the wages of sin is
[2:04:08] death. That's right. But the gift of God
[2:04:12] is eternal life through Jesus Christ our
[2:04:15] Lord. Romans
[2:04:19] 6:23. This is a gift that he gave to us
[2:04:23] when he called us.
[2:04:26] and and
[2:04:27] and yes, there will be rewards that are
[2:04:31] given to
[2:04:33] us. Yet, when we have been given these
[2:04:37] rewards, we're not going to be standing
[2:04:40] in a in another dimension in a heavenly
[2:04:42] place holding up. Look at my reward.
[2:04:48] I made it through 50 years on earth
[2:04:52] serving the Lord. Look at the reward
[2:04:54] that I got.
[2:05:03] Look at my reward. My reward for not
[2:05:06] killing my children.
[2:05:21] Here's one for some of you. Look at my
[2:05:25] reward. I endured
[2:05:29] 75 three-hour brother Shelly sermons.
[2:05:44] If he's watching, I'll get
[2:05:52] it. Let me just tell you all something.
[2:05:58] If you had to sit in a denominational
[2:06:02] church and get a 20
[2:06:07] minute
[2:06:10] sermonet and then you go out the rest of
[2:06:13] the week and do what you want to
[2:06:15] do and come back the next week and get a
[2:06:20] 15 or a 20 minute sermonet
[2:06:23] again. No meat, no substance,
[2:06:28] nothing to help you grow.
[2:06:32] Just enough for you to say, "I've been
[2:06:34] to church." And for you to yell all the
[2:06:37] rest of the week, that's not fair.
[2:06:42] You would be glad
[2:06:44] to sit under the sound of the word for
[2:06:46] two or three or four hours
[2:06:49] with the meat that we get in this place.
[2:06:52] Friend, we are a privileged people to be
[2:06:55] able to sit for two or three hours under
[2:06:58] the sound of the word and hear the
[2:07:01] gospel of Jesus Christ. Not just pablum,
[2:07:04] a real not not milk but meat of the word
[2:07:09] that will help us to grow and to
[2:07:11] overcome the attitude of that's not fair
[2:07:14] to get to the place where we say no
[2:07:17] matter what anybody else gets rewarded,
[2:07:19] no matter what anybody else is doing, no
[2:07:22] matter how easy somebody else has it,
[2:07:26] Lord, I will serve you
[2:07:29] with everything that's in me.
[2:07:34] Musicians, make your way this
[2:07:37] way. It's not
[2:07:39] fair. It's not fair that some have it
[2:07:45] easy and some have it difficult. It's
[2:07:48] not fair that some are married and some
[2:07:50] are not. It's not fair that some have
[2:07:53] babies and some don't. It's not fair
[2:07:55] that some seem to struggle to meet their
[2:07:57] bills and others seem to have plenty.
[2:08:00] It's not fair. It
[2:08:02] isn't when all you're looking at is the
[2:08:06] evenness of the playing field of
[2:08:09] earthbound creatures.
[2:08:14] But I am not a creature who is bound to
[2:08:19] this earth. I have been called to a
[2:08:22] higher place in Jesus Christ. And I
[2:08:26] realize that to get
[2:08:31] there, I'm not going to be able to be a
[2:08:33] wimp.
[2:08:36] I'm not going to be able to be a
[2:08:39] so to speak. I am going to have to eat
[2:08:42] meat and I am going to have to let the
[2:08:47] meat provide the nutrients in my inner
[2:08:50] man.
[2:08:52] You remember years ago, brother Shelley
[2:08:54] preaching about the meat of obedience.
[2:08:57] Well, that is what the meat of the word
[2:08:59] provides to me. It helps me to be
[2:09:04] obedient to the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:09:07] because I know that he did not call me
[2:09:10] to a denominational system. He did not
[2:09:13] call me to a pretty place to live. He
[2:09:16] did not call me into a place where that
[2:09:19] uh everything was going to be at ease
[2:09:22] and my fingertips. He called me to a
[2:09:26] higher level of living in the Lord Jesus
[2:09:30] Christ where that he was going to place
[2:09:32] inside of me the
[2:09:38] faith he put me at the right coordinates
[2:09:44] and he's always going to have that
[2:09:49] fish with God GPS in him. Yes.
[2:09:53] to get him to the right place.
[2:09:57] And that is exactly what is happening to
[2:10:00] some of you. You feel like that you're
[2:10:02] in the
[2:10:04] fish because you wanted it your
[2:10:09] way. And when you got your way, it
[2:10:13] wasn't really what you wanted.
[2:10:19] Jonah when he was on the ship to Tarses,
[2:10:23] he thought it's what he wanted and so
[2:10:25] much that he went down in the in the
[2:10:27] bottom and went to
[2:10:29] sleep. But when he got woke up abruptly
[2:10:34] and said, "Hey, Bub, this ship's going
[2:10:37] down. You better pray to your God."
[2:10:39] Jonah wasn't sure that's where he wanted
[2:10:41] to be anymore.
[2:10:43] But he did have enough sense to say,
[2:10:45] "Put me overboard. Everything will be
[2:10:47] all right if you put me overboard. I
[2:10:50] don't know where I'm going to end up,
[2:10:51] but put me overboard." But God already
[2:10:53] had the fish.
[2:10:56] God already has the shepherd's rod.
[2:11:00] God already has the woman. God already
[2:11:03] has the man. He may already have a a
[2:11:07] zipper for
[2:11:10] you. Says, "Hey
[2:11:13] man, you're a bloody husband to me. You
[2:11:16] didn't do what you're supposed to do.
[2:11:18] I'm going to help you to do it."
[2:11:20] Sometimes that's the way it is. God has
[2:11:23] the right thing at the right place at
[2:11:25] the right time to get you where you need
[2:11:27] to be.
[2:11:36] and all the time
[2:11:38] screaming, "That's not
[2:11:42] fair. That family over there has it way
[2:11:45] easier than we have it. It's not
[2:11:50] fair. I didn't choose your
[2:11:56] path. Choose your path.
[2:12:01] Fact is, I didn't even choose my
[2:12:07] own. I cooperated with the one who chose
[2:12:15] me. And should you think that I'm goody
[2:12:18] two shoes, I just want to tell you
[2:12:19] today, there have been times where that
[2:12:22] I uncooperated with him.
[2:12:26] And because that I uncooperate, I don't
[2:12:28] even know if that's a word, but that's
[2:12:30] working for now. I when I uncooperated
[2:12:33] with him, when I quit cooperating with
[2:12:36] the Holy
[2:12:37] Ghost and I tried to do it my own way,
[2:12:42] then it created a sequence of events in
[2:12:46] my life that brought me some heartache,
[2:12:50] some trouble, some sickness, some bills,
[2:12:54] some debt.
[2:12:57] some things that I didn't want to be a
[2:13:00] part of my
[2:13:01] life because I had uncooperated. I got
[2:13:04] out of harmony with him.
[2:13:10] But because I belonged to him, he got
[2:13:12] the shepherd's rod.
[2:13:16] He got the
[2:13:17] fish. Come on, Jonah. Come on, Jonah.
[2:13:21] You chose your own way, but I can only
[2:13:24] let you go your own way for just a
[2:13:26] little while. Let's get you back where
[2:13:28] you need to be. I've got the fish at the
[2:13:30] right
[2:13:37] coordinates. I got the bad decision that
[2:13:40] you chose.
[2:13:44] I used it and I used it to hold you
[2:13:49] captive so you can't go nowhere but
[2:13:52] where I want you to go.
[2:13:56] all of these
[2:13:59] things, though God didn't make you do
[2:14:03] them. But God allowed your choices
[2:14:08] to work in such a
[2:14:11] way to get you to the fish so that the
[2:14:15] fish could get you to Nineveh, so that
[2:14:17] you could preach to the Ninevites so
[2:14:19] that they could repent.
[2:14:22] But don't be like Jonah and sit
[2:14:25] down and start complaining and saying,
[2:14:30] "It ain't fair. I knew you'd do it that
[2:14:33] way. I
[2:14:34] knew that they would repent and you
[2:14:37] would forgive them and and all my words
[2:14:39] would seem like that I didn't know what
[2:14:41] I was talking about." No, you gave the
[2:14:44] right word and they repented
[2:14:49] and now you're mad about it.
[2:14:55] just ask you the question as they're
[2:14:56] getting ready to lead us in worship. Are
[2:15:00] you mad at
[2:15:05] God? Just answer for
[2:15:07] yourself. Can't answer for nobody else
[2:15:11] because you're not living in their
[2:15:14] situation. But are you are you mad at
[2:15:16] God? Maybe you wouldn't quite use that
[2:15:18] strong of a word.
[2:15:22] Are you aggravated at God for the
[2:15:24] circumstances you're
[2:15:29] in? Stand to your feet,
[2:15:36] please. Are you in a situation today
[2:15:39] where that
[2:15:40] you are telling
[2:15:43] God, "It's not
[2:15:47] fair. They can. and I can't. It ain't
[2:15:50] fair.
[2:15:55] As we worship
[2:15:57] together, I just want you
[2:16:00] to worship the Lord and ponder on that
[2:16:06] question, asking the
[2:16:10] Lord or asking yourself, am I aggravated
[2:16:14] with the
[2:16:15] Lord because of the situation that I'm
[2:16:19] in? And because that I am in that
[2:16:23] situation, it has caused me to be down,
[2:16:27] depressed,
[2:16:31] cold, agitated at
[2:16:37] everybody. We'll work with it in just a
[2:16:39] minute. Go ahead, Ben.
[2:16:48] Lord, you've been so
[2:16:52] good to
[2:16:54] [Music]
[2:16:58] me.
[2:17:00] Lord, you've been so
[2:17:03] good to
[2:17:08] me. You save my soul from hell.
[2:17:14] Then you made my body
[2:17:19] well. Lord, you've been so
[2:17:23] good to
[2:17:28] me. Oh
[2:17:31] Lord, you've been so
[2:17:34] good to me.
[2:17:40] And Lord, you've been so
[2:17:44] good to
[2:17:49] me. You save my soul from
[2:17:54] hell. Then you made my body
[2:18:00] well. Lord, you've been so good to me.
[2:18:10] Oh Lord, you've been so
[2:18:15] good to
[2:18:20] me. And
[2:18:22] Lord, you've been so
[2:18:25] good to
[2:18:27] [Music]
[2:18:29] me. You save my soul from hell.
[2:18:36] Then you made my body
[2:18:40] well. And Lord, you've been so
[2:18:45] good to
[2:18:48] [Music]
[2:18:51] me. Lord, you've gone so
[2:18:56] far for me.
[2:19:02] And Lord, you've gone so
[2:19:06] far for
[2:19:09] [Music]
[2:19:10] me. Took
[2:19:13] away my sin and
[2:19:16] shame so that I could wear your name. I
[2:19:22] thank you, Lord. You've gone so far for
[2:19:28] me.
[2:19:30] You've done so
[2:19:31] much. Oh
[2:19:33] Lord, you've done so
[2:19:36] much for
[2:19:42] me. And Lord, you've done so
[2:19:47] much for
[2:19:52] me. You save my soul from hell.
[2:19:58] and you made my body
[2:20:03] well.
[2:20:04] Lord, you've done so much for me. Has he
[2:20:10] been good to you? Sing it out.
[2:20:13] Oh
[2:20:15] Lord, you've been so
[2:20:18] good to
[2:20:21] me. Yes, you have, Lord.
[2:20:24] And
[2:20:25] Lord, you've been so
[2:20:29] good to
[2:20:33] me. You
[2:20:35] save my soul from
[2:20:39] hell and you made my body
[2:20:44] well.
[2:20:46] Lord, you've been so good to me.
[2:20:55] Oh
[2:20:57] Lord, you've been so
[2:21:00] good to
[2:21:05] me. And
[2:21:07] Lord, you've been so
[2:21:11] good to
[2:21:14] [Music]
[2:21:16] me. You saved my soul from hell.
[2:21:22] and you make my body well.
[2:21:29] Lord, you've been so
[2:21:33] good to me.
[2:21:39] I believe it's in the book of
[2:21:42] James. It says, "I would that you would
[2:21:45] prosper
[2:21:46] and be in health even as your soul
[2:21:50] prospers.
[2:21:52] We read earlier in the book of Ezekiel,
[2:21:54] the soul that sinnth shall surely die.
[2:22:01] And if you
[2:22:03] take the soul as the mind, the will and
[2:22:06] the
[2:22:10] emotions and
[2:22:12] you take sin as
[2:22:17] unbelief and we
[2:22:19] start getting that it's not fair
[2:22:22] attitude.
[2:22:25] Then we find
[2:22:28] oursself in places where brother Shelley
[2:22:31] has been preaching to us over these last
[2:22:33] months about the spirit of offense
[2:22:40] because we're not keeping our soul
[2:22:42] health
[2:22:44] in its proper
[2:22:46] place. We don't stay in tune with the
[2:22:49] Holy Ghost. We don't stay in harmony
[2:22:51] with him.
[2:22:54] we fall out of
[2:22:55] harmony and then the offenses start and
[2:22:59] then that's not
[2:23:01] fair and we fall farther and farther out
[2:23:04] of harmony. But the Holy Spirit has been
[2:23:07] beckoning us now for months. Get rid of
[2:23:10] those offenses.
[2:23:12] Lay down those offenses.
[2:23:15] Don't hold on to them. Get your soul
[2:23:19] health fixed up.
[2:23:22] And the spirit of the Lord is only
[2:23:24] continuing that today.
[2:23:27] You don't know the battle the person
[2:23:29] beside of you has faced. For you to be
[2:23:32] screaming, "It ain't fair." That's
[2:23:33] right.
[2:23:37] I would invite you to lay it all down at
[2:23:39] the feet of the Lord Jesus today.
[2:23:42] It is a daily walk.
[2:23:45] Every day we're laying something down.
[2:23:48] Because every day the spirit of
[2:23:51] deception, the spirit of hell tries to
[2:23:54] rise up in us and we have to lay it down
[2:23:57] and say, "Not my will, Lord. I'm yours."
[2:24:02] Let's pray together. Father, you see
[2:24:04] these that are standing around the
[2:24:06] front, those that are in the audience
[2:24:08] still in their pews, even out across the
[2:24:11] stream
[2:24:15] today. You are aware the times that we
[2:24:18] have been as the 6:00 laborers and we've
[2:24:23] told the Lord that it wasn't fair, that
[2:24:26] we'd labored longer and harder than
[2:24:29] others
[2:24:30] had. Surely we surely we deserved
[2:24:34] something. Oh God, may we have the
[2:24:37] grace, the courage, the anointing today
[2:24:41] to lay down
[2:24:43] our superiority, our seniority and say
[2:24:48] Lord I am coming back into harmony with
[2:24:55] you, harmony with the Holy Spirit.
[2:25:01] to agree to my first
[2:25:04] [Music]
[2:25:05] wage. I'll go, Lord, where you want me
[2:25:08] to go and I will do what you want me to
[2:25:13] do. I'm just a willing
[2:25:20] vessel. Lord, I realize it's not
[2:25:24] easy in these
[2:25:26] natural standard of things.
[2:25:30] Life is not always easy. But
[2:25:32] Lord, you have promised that there is a
[2:25:38] new body that is waiting us, a place
[2:25:41] that you have prepared where that we'll
[2:25:44] never
[2:25:46] die. And we know that the soul that
[2:25:49] sins, it shall surely die.
[2:25:53] And when we don't live in a life of
[2:25:59] repentance, there are those, Lord, who
[2:26:02] will taste of the second
[2:26:05] death. I thank you, Lord, that you've
[2:26:08] delivered us from
[2:26:11] that. We confess we are
[2:26:19] yours. We're yours, Lord.
[2:26:23] Are you willing to lift your hands and
[2:26:25] say, "I am yours, Lord.
[2:26:28] I will do your
[2:26:30] [Music]
[2:26:32] command. I come into harmony with
[2:26:37] you,
[2:26:39] [Music]
[2:26:46] Jesus. Oh
[2:26:48] Lord, you've been so good.
[2:26:53] to
[2:26:57] me. Oh
[2:26:59] Lord, you've been so
[2:27:03] good to
[2:27:05] [Music]
[2:27:09] me.
[2:27:11] Lord, you've been so
[2:27:14] good to me.
[2:27:18] [Music]
[2:27:21] You
[2:27:22] saved my soul from
[2:27:25] hell and you
[2:27:27] made my body well.
[2:27:33] Lord, you've been so
[2:27:36] good to me.

[2:30:36] leave. There'll be service here on

[2:30:40] 7:00. You get stuck with me
[2:30:43] again. Brother Shelley is going to
[2:30:46] remain in North Carolina and then go
[2:30:48] over and preach for Brother Bill Y on
[2:30:50] Wednesday night. Uh, Brother Bill was at
[2:30:52] the meeting on Friday night. Asked him
[2:30:54] to come and preach for him. And so,
[2:30:57] Brother Shelley is going to do that. So,
[2:30:59] we want to remember him as he would go
[2:31:02] do that. Remember him and his family,
[2:31:04] all of those that are traveling. I know
[2:31:06] some have to come back maybe today or
[2:31:08] tomorrow. I don't know exactly uh to get
[2:31:10] back to jobs, but let's remember Brother
[2:31:13] Shelley and his family uh while they're
[2:31:15] there and that God will continue to use
[2:31:18] them for his purposes. May the Lord
[2:31:20] bless you and keep you as you leave and
[2:31:23] the presence of the holy shakina glory
[2:31:27] be upon you in the name of the Lord. God
