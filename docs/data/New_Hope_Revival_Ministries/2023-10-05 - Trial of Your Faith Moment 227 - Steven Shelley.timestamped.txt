[0:00] amen and then after the New Birth is the
[0:04] trial of your faith first Peter 1:7 in
[0:07] the Amplified so that the genuiness of
[0:10] your faith may be
[0:13] tested your faith which is infinitely
[0:16] more precious than the perishable gold
[0:19] which is tested and purified by fire
[0:24] this proving of your faith is intent
[0:28] intended to redem found to your praise
[0:31] and glory and honor when Jesus Christ
[0:34] the Messiah the anointed one is revealed
[0:38] so all of this that you're going through
[0:41] the trial of your faith the proving of
[0:44] your faith it is intended so that when
[0:48] you are finished with this journey it is
[0:51] going to be that you have a great
[0:55] contribution to your praise and glory
[0:57] and honor when he is revealed revealed
[1:00] in his
[1:03] fullness now in Reading I have come to
[1:08] understand that
[1:09] gold does not exist in its purest form
[1:18] naturally The Ore is extracted from the
[1:21] earth and in that ore there are
[1:28] contaminants and then there are
[1:30] different ways to get the contaminants
[1:33] out of the
[1:35] gold
[1:36] uh and it is the way that they get it
[1:41] till that it gets to the highest level
[1:44] in my understanding 24 Karat being the
[1:47] purest of
[1:49] gold so in this mining process being
[1:52] mixed with
[1:53] impurities one of the ways that they
[1:56] refine this gold is to
[2:00] apply
[2:03] heat
[2:07] 1,9
[2:08] 48°
[2:13] fah Mighty hot
[2:19] I and I heard a minister a few weeks ago
[2:23] talking about gold and was talking about
[2:26] the refining process something that
[2:28] struck me
[2:30] he said you
[2:32] know the
[2:34] gold is not crying out stop the
[2:39] heat it's the
[2:41] impurities that are screaming stop the
[2:47] heat the gold says Crank It
[2:50] Up get all the impurities
[2:53] out the impurities are screaming whoa
[2:56] that's enough for right now take them
[2:59] it's too
[3:01] hot and when we get in the middle of the
[3:05] trial we the human part of us we can
[3:10] hardly stand the heat of this refining
[3:13] process but yet there's something deep
[3:15] down on the inside that's crying turn it
[3:19] up get it as hot as it needs to be I'm
[3:22] tired of this refining process let's get
[3:25] to the Purity hallelujah
[3:28] hallelujah
[3:31] AB
