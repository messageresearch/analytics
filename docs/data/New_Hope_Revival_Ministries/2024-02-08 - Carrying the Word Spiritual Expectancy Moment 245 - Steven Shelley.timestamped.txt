[0:00] now to those that have been around
[0:03] people who women that are
[0:07] expecting they watch things change in
[0:10] their lives yes and things start to
[0:13] change pretty quickly whenever they're
[0:16] with child yes you know a lot of times
[0:18] their diet
[0:21] changes and things that they used to
[0:23] like to
[0:24] eat now they don't like it so much or
[0:28] their body starts rejec ing the things
[0:31] that they're trying to put in and the
[0:33] body says no that's not what I need
[0:36] that's not what I want and get that
[0:38] trash out of here and that's what it's
[0:40] what their body will do it will dictate
[0:42] to you I can't take that in anymore dur
[0:45] in this time of my life because there's
[0:47] a different life that's inside of me and
[0:50] the life that's inside of me is
[0:55] dictating what I can
[0:58] consume heard it
[1:00] the life that's inside of me is
[1:03] dictating that I can't eat certain
[1:06] things anymore I have to look at
[1:08] changing my diet yes sir there's even
[1:11] things that
[1:13] places that a pregnant woman can't go
[1:16] right you go to a a theme park and they
[1:19] would have signs that would tell you
[1:21] that you know don't ride this ride if
[1:24] you're pregnant because we want you to
[1:27] protect the life that that is inside of
[1:31] you so be careful where you're going
[1:35] because we need you to protect that
[1:38] right now takes precedence yes whenever
[1:41] you're pregnant the life that is growing
[1:43] inside of you takes precedence over
[1:46] everything you have to listen to that it
[1:49] it will dictate what's going on you
[1:52] you'll find that you'll Place
[1:54] restrictions upon yourself because of
[1:57] that life that's inside of you amen and
[2:00] if you you you watch pregnant
[2:04] women as they as they
[2:07] progress you'll see that their walk
[2:12] changes you you'll see that that that
[2:15] that maybe they don't walk as they
[2:17] normally did they they kind of move a
[2:20] little bit and you want to say water but
[2:23] you
[2:24] a I was thinking that word I didn't know
[2:27] if it was allowed I don't want to be
[2:29] offensive but it it's mean it's it's a
[2:32] it's a waddle um that that takes place
[2:36] and I mean I i' I've watched it um
[2:39] multiple times in in our home and there
[2:42] is a change oh yes in the way that they
[2:46] walk and that change was because they're
[2:50] expecting there's a new life that's
[2:52] growing there's an inward change that's
[2:54] good brother that starts to make an
[2:57] outward expression right right
[3:01] because of the inward change things on
[3:04] the outside will be changing as well but
[3:07] see in the early stages it's hard to
[3:11] tell that's right that's right but you
[3:13] give it a little bit of time
[3:16] uhhuh and then it becomes very
[3:19] apparent that there is definitely
[3:21] something different about that
[3:23] person there is a real life that is
[3:27] developing inside of them yes and that
[3:31] life is changing them come on now and
[3:34] it's becomes very apparent amen and you
[3:37] can tell that they are expecting and it
[3:41] shows if you become pregnant with the
[3:43] word of
[3:45] God you say well finally he's going to
[3:47] preach now I've been preaching the whole
[3:50] time been preaching the whole
[3:53] time when we become pregnant with his
[3:57] word you'll find
[4:00] that there's changes that happen in your
[4:03] life if you're not finding changes
[4:06] taking place I question whether or not
[4:09] you have been
[4:10] impregnated by the word of God if you
[4:13] can still do all the things that you
[4:17] have always
[4:18] done if you can still go to all the
[4:22] places that you've always went if you
[4:24] can still have the same
[4:27] conversations that's right it might get
[4:29] stick but if you can still have the same
[4:31] kind of
[4:32] conversations that you've always had see
[4:35] cuz when a pregnant woman when she's
[4:37] pregnant in that home the conversations
[4:41] change the conversations are
[4:44] concentrated around that
[4:47] life right and pretty much wherever she
[4:50] goes at some point the conversation is
[4:53] going to start is going to twist around
[4:56] and turn to the pregnancy yes and the
[4:59] the life that's living inside of her yes
[5:02] sir but if we can say we can stand here
[5:04] and say I've been impregnated by the
[5:08] word and yet we don't have any changes
[5:10] going on in our life our conversation
[5:14] never goes back to the word I question
[5:18] that because I I I know I you get around
[5:21] people and it doesn't take long just
[5:24] listening to their conversations you'll
[5:26] find out what their passions are in life
