[1:04:01] we
[1:04:02] see we we speak and confess by what we
[1:04:06] know well that was
[1:04:11] unplanned man didn't plan that but the
[1:04:15] Holy Spirit
[1:04:17] did and if I was a part of a church that
[1:04:20] the Holy Spirit couldn't move in I'd
[1:04:22] find me another
[1:04:24] church I'm so thankful I'm so thankful
[1:04:27] I'm so
[1:04:28] thankful I'm so
[1:04:32] [Applause]
[1:04:36] thankful you may be seated just a moment
[1:04:39] what a week this has
[1:04:42] been there's been so many things most of
[1:04:45] them good but there has also been
[1:04:48] tragedy and so we have a family to pray
[1:04:51] for today we didn't mention it in the
[1:04:53] prayer request I thought I might just
[1:04:56] direct you to the app where brother
[1:04:58] Robert has written about something that
[1:05:01] has taken place in the life of of
[1:05:03] Tiffany's husband and of course it
[1:05:06] affects them all and we want to pray for
[1:05:09] that family we especially want to pray
[1:05:11] for Josh
[1:05:13] SS and for the entire family that God
[1:05:16] will help them it's a difficult time for
[1:05:20] them but God is with us if we trust him
[1:05:23] if we put our hope in him he's with us
[1:05:25] in the good and the
[1:05:27] bad and you know you can't blame a God
[1:05:30] that you don't believe
[1:05:31] in and so we really need to pray that
[1:05:34] God will use this tender moment he'll
[1:05:37] use brother Robert and sister Teresa to
[1:05:39] minister to that
[1:05:41] family we have seen God move this week
[1:05:44] not only one new life given to us but
[1:05:47] two new lives given to us and God was
[1:05:51] real in both of them and we welcome both
[1:05:55] both of those new babies they are as
[1:05:58] fresh as they can
[1:05:59] be one six days and
[1:06:03] one today would be three
[1:06:07] days and uh born Friday so this would be
[1:06:11] two days Saturday Sunday right two days
[1:06:15] and I know what the doctors would say we
[1:06:18] didn't ask
[1:06:19] them there's no safer place to be than
[1:06:22] in the presence of the Lord
[1:06:26] I could feel us all cringed just a
[1:06:28] little bit when the spirit of the Lord
[1:06:30] moved on Jenna because we know that
[1:06:32] she's had
[1:06:33] surgery but you know we're just we just
[1:06:36] believe I just said Lord she's in your
[1:06:38] hands there wouldn't be anything we
[1:06:40] could do to stop her
[1:06:42] now and so she's just in your hands and
[1:06:45] you'll just have to continue the healing
[1:06:48] process both of these mothers are are
[1:06:51] extremely unusual anyway and they're
[1:06:54] strong women and we thank God for
[1:06:57] them we were literally sitting in we
[1:07:00] heard that Friday morning that Liz was
[1:07:03] having some contractions and she was
[1:07:06] convinced on Tuesday night that it was
[1:07:08] all Braxton Hicks along the way but
[1:07:10] there must have been a little something
[1:07:11] else going on because the Midwife only
[1:07:14] made it by did they tell me 29 minutes
[1:07:18] is that right can anybody
[1:07:20] confirm say it
[1:07:23] again the Midwife was there 29 minutes
[1:07:26] before she was
[1:07:27] needed and my wife who was supposed to
[1:07:30] be there and to bring tally I think they
[1:07:31] were what were you 11 minutes they they
[1:07:34] got their 11 minutes before the baby was
[1:07:37] born and from my understanding this
[1:07:39] might be too much information for some
[1:07:41] of you delicate people but from what I
[1:07:44] understand it was one long
[1:07:46] push and she was
[1:07:49] here and so two days later she's in the
[1:07:52] house of God and we're so thankful there
[1:07:55] there is a whole story behind what has
[1:07:58] happened for Benjamin and Jenna but it's
[1:08:01] really their story and when the time is
[1:08:04] right of course some of you are hearing
[1:08:06] it from them and that's the best way to
[1:08:08] hear it but at some point we will we'll
[1:08:11] tell you a little bit about it because
[1:08:12] there's a there's a part of the story
[1:08:15] that that doesn't just belong to them
[1:08:17] and we'll share it with all of you I'm
[1:08:19] just so thankful for a group of people
[1:08:22] who who really believe they don't just
[1:08:25] say they believe they believe and we
[1:08:28] thank you for your prayers we're blessed
[1:08:30] with wonderful anointed music and we
[1:08:32] want to thank these musicians for their
[1:08:34] service to the Lord

[1:08:46] together now and continue the service we

[1:09:25] and we can certainly say that our home
[1:09:27] is filled with the same presence God
[1:09:30] bless you
[1:09:32] richly that's our prayer the reason why
[1:09:35] that touches me so is we have prayed
[1:09:38] Lord let your same presence visit those
[1:09:41] who can only join us by stream and I
[1:09:45] truly believe that if you create an
[1:09:47] atmosphere where the spirit of the Lord
[1:09:48] is welcome he comes like that whether
[1:09:52] it's listening in on the telephone or
[1:09:54] whether it's watching a video or whether
[1:09:56] it's hearing the prophet on a
[1:09:57] tape sometimes I'm hearing brother
[1:10:00] brandom preach and I am thinking oh I
[1:10:02] wish I could see I wish I could see him
[1:10:05] I wish I could see what's going on when
[1:10:08] he would say that lady there in the
[1:10:10] third row that light is over I want to
[1:10:12] see her but that's not possible but
[1:10:15] we're thankful today for the technology
[1:10:17] that we have
[1:10:19] amen would you stand again and let's go
[1:10:22] to the word and um
[1:10:29] we're just blessed to be able to do that
[1:10:31] today is a special day because we get to
[1:10:35] dedicate a handsome little boy back to
[1:10:39] the Lord a miracle another miracle and
[1:10:43] we're so
[1:10:45] thankful brother Austin came in the
[1:10:47] office just after me meeting him and he
[1:10:51] told me he said God showed me he's going
[1:10:53] to give me a son and and they're holding
[1:10:56] that son in their arms today and sister
[1:11:00] Anna went through so much in her first
[1:11:02] pregnancy that of course there was extra
[1:11:06] concern but God was with her every step
[1:11:09] of the way and today they have come to
[1:11:12] give little Isaiah River back to the
[1:11:14] Lord because they know that's where life
[1:11:16] comes from and he's in their hands and
[1:11:20] we wanted this to be about the gift that
[1:11:23] God has given to them
[1:11:26] and uh we're just going to celebrate
[1:11:27] with them at the end of this service I'm
[1:11:30] so glad that brother and sister Miller
[1:11:32] could come they've made a great
[1:11:34] sacrifice to be here for to be in church
[1:11:38] but also to be at the dedication of
[1:11:40] their little
[1:11:41] grandon they have flown in in the wee
[1:11:44] hours of the morning driven all the way
[1:11:46] home what time did you did you hit
[1:11:48] opala 2:30 and what time do you leave
[1:11:52] Atlanta
[1:11:55] 7:30 tonight that's that's pretty good
[1:11:58] isn't it you have to you have to be
[1:12:01] Daniel and Anna
[1:12:02] Miller to pull that off most of us
[1:12:06] couldn't do it but they're not built
[1:12:08] like most of us and we're very thankful
[1:12:10] for that it comes in handy doesn't it
[1:12:12] would you turn in your Bibles this
[1:12:14] morning to well it's noon now to Romans
[1:12:18] chapter
[1:12:20] 8 and we were there Tuesday night and
[1:12:24] I'd like to go back back there for for
[1:12:26] just a few moments I don't want to step
[1:12:28] on anybody's toes but I just want to
[1:12:32] remind you today these are familiar
[1:12:35] quotations that we'll use and familiar
[1:12:38] scriptures but I just want to remind you
[1:12:39] that it's a necessity for real
[1:12:42] Christians to forget their
[1:12:45] feelings it's not that we don't have
[1:12:48] feelings but as real Believers it is
[1:12:51] necessary that we lay our feelings aside
[1:12:55] and we take God at his word we have to
[1:12:58] do that in crisis we have to do that in
[1:13:01] good times we have to do that in
[1:13:03] mediocre times and we particularly have
[1:13:06] to do it in difficult times because life
[1:13:09] is a strain and it's stressful fear is
[1:13:13] the enemy of Faith yes and it's easy for
[1:13:16] all of us to walk in fear but as true
[1:13:19] believers we have to put fear aside
[1:13:21] sometimes we have to drive it out
[1:13:24] sometimes we have to talk talk to it and
[1:13:25] tell it to go so that faith can come and
[1:13:29] take its place because you're given a
[1:13:32] Measure of Faith it's never that you
[1:13:34] don't have enough Faith as a Believer
[1:13:37] brother brandom settled that in the stat
[1:13:39] family it's not that you didn't have
[1:13:42] enough Faith to heal that little child
[1:13:45] but it's that God saw your great faith
[1:13:48] and he chose to carry out his divine
[1:13:50] plan knowing that you would continue to
[1:13:53] love him and serve him him and praise
[1:13:56] him let me remind you before I read the
[1:13:59] scripture that God is either Sovereign
[1:14:01] or he is not
[1:14:04] sovereign and if we walk away from any
[1:14:06] situation and say if if there would have
[1:14:09] been another doctor if there would have
[1:14:11] been another medicine if there would
[1:14:13] have been another procedure if we walk
[1:14:15] away with that kind of a declaration
[1:14:17] we're not moving in faith we're moving
[1:14:20] in feelings because if God is Sovereign
[1:14:23] the right man will show show up at the
[1:14:25] right time to do whatever needs to be
[1:14:28] done and we're not looking to man anyway
[1:14:31] we're looking to God we know that he has
[1:14:35] ultimately all the power I read all 23
[1:14:38] verses to you on Tuesday night so I'm
[1:14:41] going to do my best not to do that but
[1:14:44] just show us verse one so that everyone
[1:14:46] will remember the context of Romans
[1:14:49] chapter 8 I'll read a few verses and let
[1:14:51] you have your seat and we'll move on
[1:14:53] there is therefore now now no I want to
[1:14:57] hear you say no no there is therefore
[1:15:00] now no condemnation to them which are in
[1:15:04] Christ Jesus if there's any condemnation
[1:15:08] over your life you can rest assured God
[1:15:10] didn't place it there he may convict you
[1:15:14] he may certainly cause you to feel
[1:15:16] conviction and to surrender more of your
[1:15:19] life to him but he does not condemn his
[1:15:21] own if you're in this word and this word
[1:15:24] is in you there is therefore now no
[1:15:28] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:15:30] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:15:35] after the spirit that's the mark of a
[1:15:38] True Believer why do you say that
[1:15:41] because John's gospel says it as many as
[1:15:44] are led by the spirit of God they are
[1:15:48] the sons of God you know God's leading
[1:15:51] the
[1:15:52] believer may God add his Blessing to the
[1:15:54] reading of his word you may be seated
[1:15:57] God is leading the
[1:15:59] believer sometimes we don't even know
[1:16:01] we're being led we just feel a tug or a
[1:16:04] pull or an urge and it is the spirit of
[1:16:08] the Lord within us directing us and
[1:16:11] leading us whether we're aware of it or
[1:16:13] not I believe the more aware we become
[1:16:17] of the leadership of the spirit in our
[1:16:19] life the more successful we'll be as
[1:16:23] Christians in the last days
[1:16:25] he this he promised he would never leave
[1:16:28] us and he would never forsake us would
[1:16:32] you show us verse three for what the law
[1:16:36] could not do and when he says law he's
[1:16:40] referring to the instruction of the Old
[1:16:42] Testament particularly the first five
[1:16:45] books of the Bible or what we call the
[1:16:48] Torah and uh you remember that this is
[1:16:51] the Apostle Paul who is speaking a
[1:16:54] Pharisee among Pharisees one who so
[1:16:58] learned the law of Moses that he had
[1:17:02] committed as a Pharisee he had committed
[1:17:04] a great portion of all five books to
[1:17:08] memory and it was particularly necessary
[1:17:11] in second temple period time that as a
[1:17:15] Pharisee he would have to recite the
[1:17:17] Book of Leviticus from
[1:17:19] memory now I want you to know that's a
[1:17:21] big thing because a lot of us can't even
[1:17:24] read in the Book of
[1:17:26] Leviticus but he had to commit it to
[1:17:28] memory because he had committed himself
[1:17:30] to the law so for a Pharisee among
[1:17:34] Pharisees to speak to this little
[1:17:37] believing church and say to them for
[1:17:39] what the law could not do in that it was
[1:17:44] weak through the flesh God sending his
[1:17:48] own son and he didn't send his own son
[1:17:53] in flesh that was was Angelic he sent
[1:17:57] his son in the likeness
[1:18:00] of sinful flesh and for sin condemned
[1:18:06] sin in the flesh now we closed on
[1:18:11] Tuesday night with with one of these
[1:18:14] quotations in in the sermon whyatt had
[1:18:16] to be Shepherd I just want to reread
[1:18:18] that one paragraph to you as we move on
[1:18:22] he had started a new creation he's
[1:18:25] referring to God what was it a creation
[1:18:30] of himself help me now God was made
[1:18:34] flesh and dwelt Among Us the Bible said
[1:18:37] in the beginning of the creation of God
[1:18:40] God was created in human form in Jesus
[1:18:45] Christ his son God dwelt he built his
[1:18:51] Tabernacle of Flesh and Bones and lived
[1:18:55] in that Tabernacle God
[1:18:58] Emmanuel God With Us he built himself a
[1:19:03] house to live in so he could reflect his
[1:19:07] word to his subjects through that that
[1:19:11] being the word made flesh you know what
[1:19:15] God is when you see Christ I tell you
[1:19:19] you think that is just common
[1:19:21] Christianity 101 but I'm tell telling
[1:19:25] you it comes by only by
[1:19:27] Revelation because many will say yes of
[1:19:30] course Jesus is a is one of the persons
[1:19:33] or the second person in the godhead and
[1:19:36] they try to so compartmentalize God cut
[1:19:40] him up in little pieces that they have
[1:19:42] no real revelation of who he is so we
[1:19:45] thank God for the Revelation that when
[1:19:48] we have seen Christ we have looked into
[1:19:50] the face of the father Jesus says it
[1:19:53] himself he said when you've seen me
[1:19:57] you've seen the father now what about
[1:20:00] the paraclete what about the Holy Ghost
[1:20:02] he said I will not leave you comfortless
[1:20:05] in one place he said I'll send you
[1:20:07] another comforter but in another place
[1:20:10] he said I I Jesus talking to his
[1:20:13] disciples I will come to you now how did
[1:20:17] Jesus come to the disciples we're we're
[1:20:19] drawing very close to the biblical Feast
[1:20:22] of chavot we only have a little while to
[1:20:25] go and uh maybe you were Disturbed that
[1:20:28] I didn't mention Pentecost Sunday
[1:20:31] because the church gets you know quite
[1:20:33] excited around the world about Pentecost
[1:20:35] Sunday well I'd get excited about it too
[1:20:37] if it was at the right time but we
[1:20:40] understand that that shav doesn't come
[1:20:43] on the Gregorian calendar it comes on a
[1:20:45] Hebrew calendar which was God's calendar
[1:20:48] so we're going to commemorate soon the
[1:20:51] the Feast of chavot which is now called
[1:20:55] Pentecost and when he came into that
[1:20:57] upper room that wasn't another
[1:21:01] person that was the same God he said I
[1:21:04] will come to you so they were not filled
[1:21:07] with a substitute they were not filled
[1:21:10] with a proxy they were filled with the
[1:21:13] very same God who had spoke to them in a
[1:21:16] fleshly body because that's Same Spirit
[1:21:19] and here is the promise if that same
[1:21:22] spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
[1:21:25] dwell in
[1:21:27] you it shall also Quicken make alive
[1:21:31] resurrect your mortal body now you want
[1:21:35] someone to behave you want someone to to
[1:21:39] to always be able to to push down what
[1:21:42] they feel bubbling up inside some of my
[1:21:46] friends are preaching very hard these
[1:21:48] days against what they call a Revival of
[1:21:52] emotion well I cannot help help to
[1:21:55] remember that over and over and over
[1:21:58] again the prophet tells us if there's no
[1:22:00] emotion in your religion it's already
[1:22:03] dead that's he it's only good for one
[1:22:06] thing and that's to be buried yes sir I
[1:22:08] don't think I could hold steady if I
[1:22:10] didn't have something that on some
[1:22:12] occasion I could feel it now we're not
[1:22:16] living by feelings but we're not
[1:22:18] minimalizing their presence in our life
[1:22:21] no I've told you many times Church
[1:22:23] through the years that people have said
[1:22:25] to me in dire times in their life in a
[1:22:29] funeral situation they have said now you
[1:22:32] know when we are in church we're not
[1:22:34] we're we're just we we don't act like
[1:22:36] everybody because we're not emotional
[1:22:38] people we're just not emotional people
[1:22:41] well I want you to know when they got in
[1:22:43] a situation that was unpleasant and when
[1:22:46] they begin to experience grief or lost
[1:22:49] guess what happened they became
[1:22:51] extremely emotion extreme emotion driven
[1:22:56] extremely emotional and I've even been
[1:22:58] in places where where someone had to be
[1:23:01] slapped I'm just thankful I wasn't the
[1:23:03] one that had to do it they had to be
[1:23:06] slapped to bring them down out of
[1:23:08] hysterics and I remembered them telling
[1:23:10] me through the years I'm not an
[1:23:12] emotional person let me tell you
[1:23:15] something we're all given emotions we
[1:23:18] learn to control them and that's a very
[1:23:21] good thing but when the spirit of God
[1:23:24] begins to move in your life the very
[1:23:27] life of Jesus Christ begins to Bubble Up
[1:23:30] The Apostle called it anastasis in Greek
[1:23:34] which means a a a resurrection that is
[1:23:40] reproducible when our Lord raised from
[1:23:42] the dead he raised with a resurrection
[1:23:45] that can be reproduced in the life of
[1:23:48] the believer so aren't you glad today we
[1:23:51] can celebrate because the s o
[1:23:55] n this isn't the rising of a of a Greek
[1:23:59] god uh we call it Sunday this isn't the
[1:24:03] celebration of a Roman God we're here
[1:24:07] today to celebrate the s o
[1:24:09] n amen the very life of Jesus Christ
[1:24:13] that has fallen on the believer he goes
[1:24:16] on to tell us in
[1:24:18] demonology he said in paragraph 199 if I
[1:24:22] could think of how that Jes Jesus when
[1:24:24] he died he went and preached to the
[1:24:27] souls that were in prison he died a
[1:24:31] sinner Jesus died a
[1:24:35] sinner knowing no sin right yet our sin
[1:24:40] was on him and God listen for his sins
[1:24:46] sent him to
[1:24:48] hell that was a good idea for God but a
[1:24:52] bad idea for the devil was wasn't it the
[1:24:55] Bible said he went and preached to the
[1:24:59] souls we ended Tuesday night by talking
[1:25:02] about the fact that he descended Into
[1:25:04] the Heart of the earth and he led
[1:25:06] captivity captive and those which had
[1:25:09] slept in the faith they also raised from
[1:25:12] the dead and appeared to many and that's
[1:25:16] because the gospel was presented to them
[1:25:18] in flesh form in body form we should say
[1:25:21] and they received him as their Messiah
[1:25:25] and we know there's coming a day that
[1:25:27] National Israel is going to recognize
[1:25:30] who he is and they're going to inquire
[1:25:33] about the scars in his hands and he's
[1:25:36] going to say without
[1:25:38] condemnation these are the scars that I
[1:25:41] received in the household of my friends
[1:25:43] of my brethren but the Bible tells us
[1:25:47] all
[1:25:49] Israel true Israel will be saved so said
[1:25:54] that's hard for me to Fathom that's
[1:25:56] because the resurrected Christ hasn't
[1:25:58] come to you perhaps in body form and
[1:26:00] said I'm the one but to them he will
[1:26:03] come that way aren't you glad you can be
[1:26:06] counted among those who haven't seen him
[1:26:08] with their eyes but they believe him in
[1:26:11] their heart of Faith blessed are the
[1:26:14] eyes that have not seen and still
[1:26:17] believe how about squeezing out an amen
[1:26:20] amen in in chapter 8 verse 6 and 8 it
[1:26:24] says for to be carnally minded is is
[1:26:28] what is death you can be alive and be
[1:26:33] dead we sometimes refer to them as The
[1:26:36] Walking Dead they're not zombies of
[1:26:39] course but they're moving around in a
[1:26:42] physical body but death has already
[1:26:44] struck them from within the prophet
[1:26:47] talks about souls in prison now there
[1:26:52] are people walking around Among Us who
[1:26:54] who are already in a prison house that
[1:26:57] sounds hopeless except for the fact that
[1:27:00] God has sent a Word of Deliverance for
[1:27:04] those who are in the prison house and
[1:27:07] the word of the Lord fell on the prophet
[1:27:09] he takes his hands he looks down at his
[1:27:11] little puny arms and he says there I'm
[1:27:14] no match for these bars but the Word of
[1:27:17] Deliverance that was in his mouth
[1:27:19] screamed out House of Hell give way in
[1:27:24] the name of je woo give way in the name
[1:27:29] of Jesus Christ and there came a shaking
[1:27:31] just like in the days of the Apostles in
[1:27:34] this experience and the bars fell to the
[1:27:37] side and those prisoners began to run
[1:27:40] out and brother Brandon began to
[1:27:41] recognize some of them as they as they
[1:27:43] ran past him in Deliverance I'm holding
[1:27:46] on to that I'm believing that in the
[1:27:49] very last of the last days there are
[1:27:51] still some today held in a prison house
[1:27:54] they've been taken captive like
[1:27:56] prisoners of War taken hostage by the
[1:27:59] enemy but I believe that the power and
[1:28:01] the authority of the spoken word is in
[1:28:04] the bride and I believe one day by the
[1:28:07] unction of the Lord we'll call some of
[1:28:09] those out of their bondage and see them
[1:28:13] come to full Deliverance if that doesn't
[1:28:16] excite you something's wrong because
[1:28:19] you've got family I've got family that
[1:28:21] seem to be locked in a prison who no
[1:28:24] matter what you say no matter what they
[1:28:26] hear no matter what happens they can't
[1:28:29] seem to surrender but you know what
[1:28:32] there's coming a day like sister Hatty
[1:28:33] rght sons that a spirit of conviction
[1:28:37] will fall on them and some will run I
[1:28:40] know that some will run to the altar so
[1:28:43] to be carnally minded is death to live
[1:28:46] in your feelings is death but to be
[1:28:50] spiritually minded is not just life
[1:28:54] which we would call the opposite of
[1:28:55] death but it's also peace if this word
[1:29:00] peace were in the Old Testament it would
[1:29:01] be
[1:29:02] Shalom and Shalom doesn't just mean
[1:29:05] peace does it it's a completion it's a
[1:29:09] fullness I want you to know there's a
[1:29:11] peace that Jesus has that's not just the
[1:29:14] absence of turmoil come on now it's not
[1:29:18] just the absence of a problem but he
[1:29:20] said the peace that I give to you how
[1:29:22] many of you know that he taught us that
[1:29:24] it abides forever it seems to pass all
[1:29:29] human understanding and it never leaves
[1:29:32] us if you've ever experienced that peace
[1:29:34] when you needed him let me see your hand
[1:29:36] as a testimony he comes and in that
[1:29:40] moment that you found it hard to come to
[1:29:42] peace it's because you are letting your
[1:29:45] feelings Rule and in that moment no one
[1:29:48] can do it for you brother no one can
[1:29:50] control your feelings and emotions but
[1:29:52] you it is our resp responsibility to
[1:29:54] take a hold of those things when we
[1:29:57] recognize them pulling us away from the
[1:29:59] word when we feel those things pulling
[1:30:01] us away from Faith it's our
[1:30:03] responsibility to take them captive to
[1:30:06] arrest them to submit them ain't that
[1:30:09] what he said casting down all
[1:30:11] imagination and taking captive every
[1:30:14] thought that's contrary to truth how
[1:30:17] many of you have had to do it how many
[1:30:20] of you had to do it before you got here
[1:30:21] today maybe who knows who knows but
[1:30:25] because the carnal mind verse 7 is
[1:30:28] enmity against God for it is not subject
[1:30:31] to the law of God neither
[1:30:35] indeed can be so if you're living under
[1:30:39] some kind of of carnal mentality there's
[1:30:43] no way to bring your body your flesh
[1:30:47] into subjection to the word it's only by
[1:30:50] a spiritual mind that you're going to be
[1:30:52] able to push down the Flesh and cause it
[1:30:55] to bow to the sovereignty of Jesus
[1:30:58] Christ so then they that are flesh verse
[1:31:02] eight so then they that are in the
[1:31:05] flesh
[1:31:07] cannot
[1:31:08] cannot no matter who you are if you're
[1:31:12] living after the Flesh and the carnality
[1:31:16] of life you cannot please God I'd like
[1:31:21] to show you another translation don't be
[1:31:23] a offended I'm doing this just to help
[1:31:26] you grab the concept for the Mind Set On
[1:31:30] the flesh is death but the Mind Set On
[1:31:36] the spirit is life and peace you think
[1:31:42] I'd let the devil come in and steal my
[1:31:43] Holy Ghost no because it's his spirit in
[1:31:47] me that gives me life and peace verse
[1:31:51] seven because the mind set on the flesh
[1:31:57] is now I I know that's how most people
[1:32:00] say hostile but that's not how I say it
[1:32:04] because hostile doesn't sound big enough
[1:32:07] I say very very HiFi I say
[1:32:11] hostile I want you to see how big it is
[1:32:15] the the he said the mind that is set on
[1:32:18] the flesh is
[1:32:20] hostile toward God did you know that
[1:32:22] means it makes itself an
[1:32:24] enemy when you're living in your carnal
[1:32:27] thoughts your thoughts become an enemy
[1:32:32] to
[1:32:33] God we've got to do something about it
[1:32:36] for it does not subject itself to the
[1:32:39] law of God for it is not even able to do
[1:32:42] so so for you and I to think that we can
[1:32:45] push down the urges of the flesh by mind
[1:32:49] over matter or by thinking a better
[1:32:52] thought we must know that it's
[1:32:54] impossible to do that it's only to those
[1:32:57] who have received the Holy Spirit of God
[1:33:00] into their life who yield on his
[1:33:03] leadership and who obey what he compels
[1:33:06] them to do it's only those individuals
[1:33:10] who have the power to bring their flesh
[1:33:12] into subjection to the word it's not by
[1:33:15] will it's by the spirit it's not by
[1:33:20] might or power it's by the spirit that
[1:33:23] we win the victory do you believe that
[1:33:25] and verse 8 says and those who are in
[1:33:28] the
[1:33:30] flesh cannot please God so know this if
[1:33:34] you're not operating in the spirit
[1:33:37] you're not pleasing God if you still
[1:33:40] live on the gerbal wheel of religion
[1:33:44] thinking that you have to perform a
[1:33:47] certain way to have the favor of God
[1:33:50] you've missed
[1:33:51] Redemption this grace is not a license
[1:33:54] to sin this forgiveness is not something
[1:33:57] that causes us to do whatever we want to
[1:34:00] to to live any way we want to live and
[1:34:02] still call oursel the children of God
[1:34:04] this Grace actually moves us out of that
[1:34:07] realm and the grace of God helps push
[1:34:10] down the urge of the Flesh and bring it
[1:34:13] into subjection because the scripture
[1:34:15] tells us if we live in the urges of the
[1:34:17] flesh we cannot somebody say cannot
[1:34:22] please God are you with me good proof of
[1:34:26] the
[1:34:27] Resurrection paragraph 134 he said isn't
[1:34:30] that just the modern Christian today oh
[1:34:33] let the healing take place and they're
[1:34:35] shouting the victory let the power of
[1:34:37] the Holy Spirit fall and they're
[1:34:39] shouting the Victory and those who are
[1:34:41] really filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:34:44] remains that way sir down through life's
[1:34:48] journey so some people like to take a
[1:34:50] little quar or two of brother brandham
[1:34:52] and where he talks about the those who
[1:34:54] are emotional and those who are uh you
[1:34:56] know have a tendency toward the Spirit
[1:34:59] uh that they also often have the
[1:35:01] tendency to backbite and they often have
[1:35:03] the tendency to uh to you know hurt one
[1:35:07] another and harm one another and they're
[1:35:09] prone to all there's no doubt in my mind
[1:35:12] that is certainly a truth but don't miss
[1:35:16] everything he said you can only
[1:35:19] understand a quotation by looking at it
[1:35:22] in the light of all the other things
[1:35:24] and you've got to understand that it's
[1:35:26] possible and if you're going to live the
[1:35:29] spiritual life then then you're going to
[1:35:31] have to yield yourself to him entirely
[1:35:34] he said isn't that just the modern
[1:35:36] Christian today oh let the healing take
[1:35:39] place I want to go back they're shouting
[1:35:40] the victory let the power of the Holy
[1:35:42] Spirit fall they're shout and those who
[1:35:44] are really filled with re the those
[1:35:46] excuse me those who are really filled
[1:35:49] with the Holy Ghost remains that
[1:35:52] way what way what way shouting the
[1:35:56] victory what way shouting the victory
[1:35:59] what
[1:36:03] way those who are really filled with the
[1:36:06] Holy Ghost remain that way shouting the
[1:36:09] victory down through life's
[1:36:12] journey so so we sing in the good times
[1:36:16] praise His name in The Bad Times do the
[1:36:20] same let everything that hath breath
[1:36:23] prise praise the Lord so if you're able
[1:36:27] to yield yourself to that Holy Spirit
[1:36:29] and let him give you power to pull down
[1:36:31] the flesh you do not have to be ashamed
[1:36:34] for having the
[1:36:36] victory brother Brandon found out one
[1:36:38] time in his life that he just simply
[1:36:40] didn't have enough Victory what he said
[1:36:42] he said it and when he yielded to the
[1:36:44] Holy Spirit he found himself doing what
[1:36:47] they were doing dancing in the
[1:36:50] victory it's not about a dance oh no
[1:36:53] don't think that it's about being able
[1:36:55] to remain Rock
[1:36:58] Steady when the wind blows against you
[1:37:01] what brother Cade was singing when the
[1:37:03] water the boat he said had already
[1:37:05] started taking on
[1:37:07] water can you imagine and he thought for
[1:37:10] sure he was going to drown but in the
[1:37:13] last moment hallelujah what happened the
[1:37:16] one who controls the winds and the waves
[1:37:18] was there amen now let's move on to the
[1:37:21] next part of that he said but the man
[1:37:23] that that's still walking with a carnal
[1:37:25] mind let a little discouragement come up
[1:37:28] now I know that none of you have ever
[1:37:30] dealt with any discouragement but I have
[1:37:34] and I know what that feels like and if
[1:37:36] anybody happens to have experienced that
[1:37:39] you know what it feels like you let a
[1:37:41] little discouragement come up something
[1:37:43] go wrong and they go away saying well I
[1:37:47] thought it was all right but oh my look
[1:37:49] at it now I thought that little church
[1:37:51] would never fail I thought this person
[1:37:55] you got your
[1:37:57] mind hello you've got your mind on the
[1:38:02] the wrong thing so really Church it
[1:38:06] doesn't matter who fails around you who
[1:38:09] lets you down you got to keep trucking
[1:38:12] on for the one that saved you the one
[1:38:15] that redeemed you the one that filled
[1:38:16] you with this Spirit he said put your
[1:38:19] mind on him that can't fa fail let your
[1:38:25] conversation not be about your
[1:38:28] church we're talking to you
[1:38:32] too I'm want to add here forgive me your
[1:38:36] conversation is not about your
[1:38:38] pastor your conversation is about how
[1:38:41] you're Lord about what he's done in your
[1:38:44] life he said that's the one not about
[1:38:47] your neighbor but about your Lord let
[1:38:51] your conversation be
[1:38:54] there's only one way that you can keep
[1:38:56] your conversation of him or about him
[1:38:59] and that's to keep your
[1:39:01] thoughts on him let's look at 8 n and 10
[1:39:05] we're just taking it verse by verse as
[1:39:07] we move on so then they that are in the
[1:39:10] flesh cannot please God but ye are not
[1:39:14] in the
[1:39:15] flesh but in the
[1:39:17] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[1:39:21] dwell in you does any body have that
[1:39:24] abiding spirit in you now if any man
[1:39:27] have not the spirit of Christ he is none
[1:39:31] of his this Holy Spirit in your life is
[1:39:36] not
[1:39:37] optional it's mandatory to complete the
[1:39:40] new
[1:39:41] birth it's not just an issue of blood or
[1:39:45] an issue of water it takes life for
[1:39:48] there to be a birth and we're reminded
[1:39:51] of that this week it takes all three for
[1:39:55] there to be a birth and that spirit is
[1:39:58] the life part yes you've got to be
[1:40:01] baptized yes you've got to find a place
[1:40:04] of repentance yes you've got to be
[1:40:06] washed in the water of the word and
[1:40:08] cleansed by the blood but that doesn't
[1:40:11] complete the new birth it's only when
[1:40:13] the Holy Ghost comes to live inside of
[1:40:15] you that the new birth is completed I
[1:40:18] wish you'd help me that means if you're
[1:40:21] sitting here today and you don't know
[1:40:23] whether or not you've received the
[1:40:25] fullness of the spirit you need to check
[1:40:27] up on that and you need to begin to ask
[1:40:30] him Lord fill me and if you feel like
[1:40:33] it's leaked out it hasn't but if you
[1:40:35] feel like it has you just come and say
[1:40:38] refill me the prophet said there's one
[1:40:42] filling and many refilling aren't you
[1:40:45] glad we ought to want one every day we
[1:40:48] ought to want to experience that every
[1:40:51] day of our life so then they that are in
[1:40:53] the flesh cannot please God but ye are
[1:40:55] not in the flesh but in the spirit and
[1:40:58] if so be that the spirit of God dwell in
[1:41:01] you now if any man have not the spirit
[1:41:03] of Christ he's none of his next verse
[1:41:06] and if Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:41:11] because of sin that's good news now I
[1:41:14] want you to know sometime the flesh will
[1:41:16] try to raise itself up want it but the
[1:41:20] spirit of God can beat that down if we
[1:41:23] allow it that's where the Apostle talks
[1:41:26] about crucifying the flesh daily
[1:41:29] somebody said if you're already dead why
[1:41:31] do you have to crucify the flesh because
[1:41:33] it has this unusual ability to pull
[1:41:37] itself back together and attack you in
[1:41:41] your faith and if you don't stay on the
[1:41:43] job you'll find yourself going in the
[1:41:46] way of the flesh but if we stay vigilant
[1:41:50] and in the spirit we know that we can
[1:41:54] defeat the thoughts of the flesh we can
[1:41:56] have control over our own body we can
[1:41:59] possess our vessels in sanctification if
[1:42:02] you believe that let's say
[1:42:04] Amen brother brandham tells us in the in
[1:42:08] uh let's go on if Christ be in you the
[1:42:09] body is dead because of sin but the
[1:42:12] spirit is life because
[1:42:15] of righteousness the uncertain
[1:42:20] sound he said and yet the man somewhere
[1:42:22] down in him somewhere in him if he could
[1:42:26] only let that little as I Illustrated it
[1:42:29] like a
[1:42:31] button I want you to really listen to
[1:42:33] this
[1:42:33] one I just think about it like some
[1:42:36] little button or something on the inside
[1:42:38] of you when a man is
[1:42:41] saved that much of
[1:42:44] him that little
[1:42:46] button that much of him is
[1:42:51] God I want you to see it just a little
[1:42:54] button that much of him is God that's
[1:42:57] the little light that comes in to make
[1:43:01] him quit
[1:43:04] doing what's
[1:43:06] wrong now if you can take all the malice
[1:43:10] and envy and strife and unbelief
[1:43:15] out it didn't say the little light would
[1:43:18] do it for
[1:43:19] you it said you you're taking it out if
[1:43:22] you can take take it out if you can call
[1:43:25] it out and force it to be subject to the
[1:43:30] truth did you know you have power to
[1:43:33] take
[1:43:35] jealousy you can choose not to be
[1:43:39] jealous somebody said I've tried year
[1:43:42] after year after year and I'm just not
[1:43:44] able to control it let me tell you
[1:43:45] something you can make an active
[1:43:49] choice and when you feel that thing
[1:43:51] rising up he will
[1:43:53] when you feel that thing rising up you
[1:43:55] call it out
[1:43:57] immediately you there's no room in you I
[1:44:01] I don't want you to grow in me I want
[1:44:03] the button to
[1:44:04] grow I want that little button of light
[1:44:07] I want that little life of God that's in
[1:44:09] me to grow look look listen to what he
[1:44:11] says if you can take the malice and the
[1:44:14] envy and the strife and the unbelief out
[1:44:16] that little button like of the light and
[1:44:18] power of God will do what growing
[1:44:22] growing growing
[1:44:25] growing come on
[1:44:28] growing so you start out with a little
[1:44:31] button and the more of the old stuff
[1:44:34] that you shove out of your life and
[1:44:37] every time you're faithful you got to be
[1:44:39] vigilant you've got to be faithful to
[1:44:41] take it down every time did you know
[1:44:44] yielding to that stuff one time can pull
[1:44:47] you right out of the will of God it can
[1:44:50] place a bitterness within you and that
[1:44:52] bitterness
[1:44:53] you know it seems like it it normally
[1:44:55] takes years and years for bitterness to
[1:44:57] grow but we're living in such an
[1:44:59] accelerated
[1:45:01] hour that by entertaining those negative
[1:45:04] thoughts we can find nearly overnight
[1:45:07] that a bitterness has taken
[1:45:09] hold and what's wrong with bitterness is
[1:45:12] we start seeing everything around us
[1:45:15] from the filter of bitterness and we get
[1:45:19] matter and matter and matter and matter
[1:45:22] we get more jealous and more jealous and
[1:45:24] more jealous and the next thing you know
[1:45:26] we start cutting ourselves off from the
[1:45:29] people who love us the
[1:45:31] most we start cutting ourselves off from
[1:45:34] the church that is there to help us from
[1:45:37] our leaders that are there to help us so
[1:45:40] we isolate ourselves into a
[1:45:42] depression where if we could recognize
[1:45:45] who we are and what Authority we have
[1:45:47] over our own life I can't take jealousy
[1:45:50] out of your life but I can deal with it
[1:45:53] in mine come on a husband can't help his
[1:45:56] wife I mean you can certainly talk to
[1:45:58] her and love her and support her but in
[1:46:00] the end you can't cut that root of of
[1:46:02] jealousy or bitterness out of her heart
[1:46:05] she's the only one that can make up her
[1:46:06] mind I'm just not going to let it bother
[1:46:09] me you may not be like me but I have to
[1:46:12] talk to myself pretty
[1:46:14] often because as a minister if you let
[1:46:17] bitterness grow in your heart you'll
[1:46:19] have no compassion for the very people
[1:46:21] you're called to serve so I have to be
[1:46:24] extra
[1:46:25] vigilant and I have to remember that
[1:46:27] even somebody causes you some stress and
[1:46:30] strain you can't let a resentment
[1:46:33] come oh I know it's quiet I know after a
[1:46:36] holy ghost explosion this can be as dull
[1:46:38] as Nails I get it but somebody's got to
[1:46:42] come and Report the truth so that's what
[1:46:45] I'm trying to do today we are emotional
[1:46:48] people whether we recognize it or not
[1:46:51] and it's not someone else else's
[1:46:53] responsibility you you can raise your
[1:46:55] children right and talk to them about
[1:46:57] everything but only they can deal with
[1:46:59] what's growing in the as they begin to
[1:47:01] grow and mature so if we get some of
[1:47:04] that other stuff
[1:47:05] unpacked and driven out of our Lives we
[1:47:09] make room that that light and power of
[1:47:12] God that starts in us like a button it
[1:47:15] will keep growing growing growing
[1:47:17] growing and this is what's so powerful
[1:47:19] as it grows it crowds out any form of
[1:47:24] unbelief and unbelief is what keeps us
[1:47:27] it's what keeps us in carnality so if we
[1:47:30] can shove the unbelief out by letting
[1:47:33] the life of God grow in it he said and
[1:47:35] you don't do it by
[1:47:38] exhortations you can preach till you're
[1:47:40] blue in the face you can talk to
[1:47:43] somebody till you're you're tired of
[1:47:45] talking you you you can't do it by
[1:47:47] bodily
[1:47:49] exercise you do it by a sanctified oh my
[1:47:54] you know that's an outlawed word in the
[1:47:56] modern Church to live a Sanctified life
[1:48:01] consecrated life that the holy spirit
[1:48:04] moves through you he said I caught some
[1:48:08] of it in a place where not long ago
[1:48:13] somewhere he was either in in a location
[1:48:17] or in a condition he came in contact
[1:48:21] with that life of the spirit of God
[1:48:24] moving in people now look at verse
[1:48:27] 11 but if the spirit this was quoted a
[1:48:31] moment ago but if the spirit of him that
[1:48:34] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:48:36] you he that raised up Messiah Christ
[1:48:39] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[1:48:44] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[1:48:49] dwelleth in you this is probably one of
[1:48:51] the greatest prom prises in the Book of
[1:48:54] Romans brother brandham talks about it
[1:48:57] and it is the rising of the Sun and that
[1:48:59] is Su in the title but he's not
[1:49:02] preaching about the rising of the Su in
[1:49:04] the message he's preaching about the
[1:49:06] rising of the s n paragraph 110 and if
[1:49:09] you haven't heard this message in a long
[1:49:11] time I encourage you to listen to it
[1:49:13] maybe you heard it around the what the
[1:49:16] world calls the Easter time maybe you
[1:49:18] heard it then but if you didn't hear it
[1:49:20] again because this gets Mighty rich
[1:49:23] he said that's what he proved Hallelujah
[1:49:26] that's what Easter or we should say
[1:49:28] Resurrection proved he wasn't he wasn't
[1:49:32] only the word but he was God
[1:49:39] himself someone was debating that
[1:49:42] recently on on social media and they
[1:49:45] must have forgotten what he said because
[1:49:48] he describes God is a great big Fountain
[1:49:51] of Light rainbow colors moving through
[1:49:55] him that's what he calls God in the
[1:49:58] beginning and he said out of
[1:50:01] that went the
[1:50:03] logos which was the word so the word
[1:50:06] went out from that great big Fountain of
[1:50:09] pulsating light and so that's why the
[1:50:12] prophet tells us here he wasn't only the
[1:50:14] word but he was God God himself so it
[1:50:18] wasn't just the word that found a body
[1:50:22] the Bible tells us in him this is
[1:50:25] important to add this in him dwelt the
[1:50:29] fullness of the godhead bodily so he's
[1:50:32] not Christ is not just the word made
[1:50:34] flesh he's also the fullness of almighty
[1:50:38] God living in a body of Flesh oh thank
[1:50:42] the Lord for that he was God himself the
[1:50:46] the what the
[1:50:48] Dynamics in the word
[1:50:53] so we have the word and in the word we
[1:50:57] have some
[1:50:58] Dynamics that's Spirit life you know I
[1:51:02] think that sometimes we feel that our
[1:51:05] dedication is to the printed
[1:51:08] word but our dedication is not to the
[1:51:12] printed word it's not even so much to
[1:51:15] the magnetic recorded word our
[1:51:19] dedication is to The Living Word come on
[1:51:23] it's the Living Word that gives you
[1:51:25] eternal life he said uh the Dynamics in
[1:51:29] the word he said that made the body of
[1:51:31] Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the
[1:51:35] grave
[1:51:37] lifeless but when that life went back
[1:51:40] into that body he it shook into life and
[1:51:43] it would rise again and and roll away
[1:51:47] the
[1:51:49] stone he goes on to say I am he that was
[1:51:53] dead so dead Till The Sun said he was
[1:51:57] dead the moon said he was dead the Stars
[1:52:00] said he was dead brother brandom is
[1:52:02] reminding us that all of creation
[1:52:04] recorded it
[1:52:06] recognized it took not of the fact
[1:52:10] really that its
[1:52:13] creator had
[1:52:15] died but it was only the
[1:52:17] body all nature said he was dead and now
[1:52:20] the whole world has to recognize
[1:52:23] that he's alive again because he was not
[1:52:26] only the
[1:52:28] mechanics let me tell you something this
[1:52:30] Jesus Christ is not only the dos and the
[1:52:33] don'ts he's not only the doctrines and
[1:52:36] the man Creeds that we have sometimes
[1:52:39] accepted even around the
[1:52:41] message he's more than that he's not
[1:52:45] only the mechanics God's word he was the
[1:52:49] the Dynamics to prove it aren't you glad
[1:52:53] that because you have the mechanics you
[1:52:56] are a
[1:52:57] candidate to receive the fullness of the
[1:53:01] of the
[1:53:02] Dynamics that sets the mechanics in
[1:53:05] motion that's what happens when the
[1:53:07] spirit of God is living inside of you
[1:53:11] verse 13 for if you live after the flesh
[1:53:15] you shall die but if ye through the
[1:53:20] spirit do more mortify the Deeds of the
[1:53:26] body you shall
[1:53:29] live I I search for mortifying the
[1:53:31] message and brother bom never uses it in
[1:53:34] this particular context he uses it two
[1:53:36] times but in a different context so that
[1:53:39] makes me want to know what the word
[1:53:41] mortify means it means to make
[1:53:45] dead to put to death so let's put that
[1:53:49] in the right context if ye through the
[1:53:52] spirit Spirit make dead the Deeds of the
[1:53:56] body to put to death the Deeds of the
[1:53:59] body ye shall live but that word mortify
[1:54:02] thank you it also means to deprive of
[1:54:06] power if you will deprive your flesh
[1:54:10] thoughts your carnal mind of having any
[1:54:13] control in your life if you will do that
[1:54:17] it has no choice but to respond by
[1:54:19] dying because its life is cut off
[1:54:23] you and I Supply the strength to the
[1:54:26] flesh we do and we have the power by the
[1:54:30] spirit to cut that off and say wait a
[1:54:32] minute you're going to get in your place
[1:54:34] this flesh is not your enemy you need to
[1:54:38] understand that I hear preaching
[1:54:39] sometime that makes you uh makes it
[1:54:41] sound like your body of flesh is your
[1:54:43] enemy it's not your enemy it's God's
[1:54:45] gift to you but you and I have to have
[1:54:48] charge over it and it's easier said than
[1:54:51] done but it is our responsibility to
[1:54:54] maintain this house that he can dwell in
[1:54:57] to deprive the Flesh of power to destroy
[1:55:00] the strength thereof now remember he's
[1:55:02] talking about putting our carnal
[1:55:04] thoughts to death and the only way we
[1:55:06] can do that is by crucifying them and
[1:55:08] the only way we have power to do that is
[1:55:10] by the word for as many as are led by
[1:55:14] the spirit of God they are the sons of
[1:55:17] God now I want to go to Galatians here
[1:55:20] for just a moment and we we'll take a
[1:55:22] little more
[1:55:23] time Galatians 3: 1 now I I place that
[1:55:29] in here this
[1:55:31] morning because we are to learn from
[1:55:36] everything that happened to the children
[1:55:38] of
[1:55:38] Israel the Apostle tells us that all of
[1:55:42] their experiences in the wilderness were
[1:55:44] for our
[1:55:45] admonition they were amples or examples
[1:55:49] to us and so here is something that and
[1:55:54] and then we know as New Testament
[1:55:55] Believers that we can learn from the
[1:55:57] experiences of the early church these
[1:56:00] stories are there for a reason now this
[1:56:04] is the Apostle he is standing and he is
[1:56:08] sending a message of Truth to the church
[1:56:11] in
[1:56:12] galatia and he says to the the Believers
[1:56:16] in galatia he's not talking to the
[1:56:18] regular citizens he's writing to the
[1:56:21] Believers and he says oh foolish
[1:56:25] Galatians that's rough
[1:56:27] enough what would you thought if IID had
[1:56:29] come up here my first words would have
[1:56:31] been oh you foolish
[1:56:35] neopians what what if I said who put you
[1:56:38] in
[1:56:39] witchcraft that's what that's what the
[1:56:40] Apostle said he said oh foolish
[1:56:43] Galatians who has cast the spell over
[1:56:47] you who has Bewitched you and listen at
[1:56:51] this this is what what really drives
[1:56:54] home a serious point in my life
[1:56:58] personally oh foolish Galatians who hath
[1:57:02] Bewitched you that you should not obey
[1:57:06] the truth because before whose eyes
[1:57:10] Jesus Christ ha been evidently set forth
[1:57:16] crucified among you now let's go on this
[1:57:21] only would I learn of you received ye
[1:57:25] the spirit is a question received ye the
[1:57:29] Spirit by The Works of the
[1:57:32] law or by the hearing of
[1:57:38] Faith go
[1:57:40] back do you understand the
[1:57:44] question he's saying to those who have
[1:57:47] walked in the law of Moses in the church
[1:57:49] in galatia now they have accept Yeshua
[1:57:52] Jesus as the Messiah and he's asking
[1:57:55] them the
[1:57:56] question did you receive the spirit of
[1:57:59] Life the spirit of Truth by following
[1:58:03] the works of the
[1:58:04] law or by the quickening of Faith by the
[1:58:09] hearing of the word it's a big question
[1:58:13] because there was a tendency among those
[1:58:15] Believers to start pulling themselves
[1:58:18] back under what made them
[1:58:20] comfortable because the spirit way the
[1:58:24] leadership of the spirit was a new thing
[1:58:26] in their life and they felt like perhaps
[1:58:29] it didn't have enough structure in
[1:58:32] it you see we have a tendency to desire
[1:58:35] rules oh yes we rebel against them but
[1:58:39] we want them in place one of the things
[1:58:43] that I is can can quickly go arai in the
[1:58:47] behavior of a child that you're rearing
[1:58:50] is a child is designed by nature to need
[1:58:56] borders and parameters and
[1:59:01] limits and a child who understands the
[1:59:05] loving support of a parent who wants to
[1:59:09] protect him or her by
[1:59:12] boundaries a child who's raised in that
[1:59:15] kind of environment even the Bible tells
[1:59:17] us will
[1:59:19] Thrive but a child who's left to its own
[1:59:23] wits with no kind of restrictions
[1:59:26] allowed to play with everything allowed
[1:59:28] to touch everything allowed to destroy
[1:59:32] everything will not Thrive because they
[1:59:35] grow up not knowing what is Right
[1:59:38] completely and what is wrong completely
[1:59:41] so we by Nature even as we grow we have
[1:59:44] a desire for someone to define the
[1:59:47] boundaries for us so here the Galatians
[1:59:50] were beginning to exper experience of
[1:59:52] freedom in the spirit oh there's nothing
[1:59:56] like being free in the spirit to live
[1:59:59] your life as a holy ghost filled
[2:00:02] believer but the church in galatia found
[2:00:05] that it began to
[2:00:07] miss the restrictions and the boundaries
[2:00:11] and they began to try to pull themselves
[2:00:13] back into all of the regulations and
[2:00:18] some of those regulations could not
[2:00:20] possibly be ad appeared to in the hour
[2:00:23] they were
[2:00:25] living because we know that somewhere in
[2:00:28] there animal sacrifice ceased and the
[2:00:31] temple ceased to function and and so
[2:00:33] there are some Commandments that could
[2:00:35] not be carried out just like there are
[2:00:37] some today that cannot be carried out in
[2:00:39] the absence of the temple and yet they
[2:00:42] were trying to to kind of try to pull
[2:00:45] those regulations in upon the new found
[2:00:47] Freedom that the church was
[2:00:49] experiencing and I hope you don't miss
[2:00:52] understand me when I'm saying it this
[2:00:54] way and the and Paul began to say hey
[2:00:56] there's a problem something is taken
[2:00:59] spell over your life and he said this
[2:01:02] only what I learn of you receive ye by
[2:01:05] the spirit excuse me received ye the
[2:01:08] Spirit by The Works of the law or by the
[2:01:11] hearing of faith and let's go on and see
[2:01:13] what the rest of it says are you so
[2:01:19] foolish can you imagine starting off my
[2:01:22] service by saying you you foolish
[2:01:25] neopians what in the world is wrong with
[2:01:28] you what kind of spell have you fallen
[2:01:30] under this morning it'd be kind of hard
[2:01:33] to back the
[2:01:35] preacher
[2:01:37] hello it wouldn't matter how much I said
[2:01:39] help me help me help me you you'd get
[2:01:41] your feelings a little out of whack I
[2:01:43] know you wouldn't mine would be too if
[2:01:45] someone was saying it to me but this was
[2:01:47] a necessary message and I want you to
[2:01:49] hear what he said it's so simple that a
[2:01:51] lot of people GL over it he said are you
[2:01:53] so foolish having begun in the
[2:01:58] spirit are you now made perfect by the
[2:02:04] flesh what a
[2:02:06] question have you suffered so many
[2:02:09] things in vain if it be yet in
[2:02:14] vain he therefore that ministereth to
[2:02:18] you the spirit and worketh miracles
[2:02:21] among you doeth he it by The Works of
[2:02:24] the law or by the hearing of the faith
[2:02:27] of faith we know the answer it's by the
[2:02:31] hearing of Faith even as Abraham
[2:02:33] believed God and it was accounted to
[2:02:37] him for
[2:02:39] righteousness did you know the simple
[2:02:41] fact that Abraham believed God made a
[2:02:46] deposit in his grace
[2:02:48] account God added righteousness to AB
[2:02:51] Abraham simply because he heard the word
[2:02:56] and believed it did you know there is
[2:02:58] righteousness added to your account
[2:03:01] there is Grace added to your account and
[2:03:04] you may be out of your need for Grace
[2:03:06] but I need his grace every single day of
[2:03:10] my life and I need more Grace Living now
[2:03:13] than I did years past we're living in
[2:03:16] the most wicked hour the world has ever
[2:03:18] known and if anybody needed Grace and
[2:03:20] righteousness we do as a little bride of
[2:03:22] Jesus Christ and did you know how that
[2:03:24] keeps getting added to our account
[2:03:26] because we keep taking God at his word I
[2:03:29] want to read verse two and three in the
[2:03:32] Amplified he said let me ask you this
[2:03:34] one
[2:03:35] question did you receive the Holy Spirit
[2:03:39] as the result of obeying the law and
[2:03:40] doing its works or was it by hearing the
[2:03:44] message of the
[2:03:47] gospel and believing it a lot of people
[2:03:51] hear it only a few are willing to obey
[2:03:54] it was it from observing a law of
[2:03:57] rituals or from a message of
[2:04:02] faith I think sometimes we as Believers
[2:04:05] need to be asked the question do you
[2:04:08] believe this message because there was a
[2:04:11] cloud do you believe this message
[2:04:13] because there was a a supernatural light
[2:04:16] in Houston do you believe this message
[2:04:19] because uh there was a vision of a
[2:04:21] bridge
[2:04:22] you believe this or do you believe it
[2:04:25] because he brought to us the pure
[2:04:28] unadulterated Gospel of the word come on
[2:04:32] he brought us simple
[2:04:34] Faith preachers we as preachers have a
[2:04:37] tendency to complicate the Simplicity of
[2:04:40] this message oh yes it kind of keeps
[2:04:43] stringing the people along I've notice
[2:04:46] that we preachers have a tendency to to
[2:04:48] kind of bait the people and kind of try
[2:04:52] to uh you know pull them along into
[2:04:55] something and and we talk about
[2:04:57] Mysteries have you ever set through a
[2:04:59] sermon where someone was talking about
[2:05:02] even your pastor talking about Mysteries
[2:05:04] and you were more confused when you left
[2:05:06] the
[2:05:07] building and then the enemy moves in and
[2:05:09] says you're not a Believer I want you to
[2:05:11] know that that may not be the truth it
[2:05:14] may be that we as men of Flesh have a
[2:05:18] tendency to complicate the Simplicity of
[2:05:20] the gospel and that that's why you've
[2:05:22] got to supplement your pastor's
[2:05:24] preaching uh and I hate to put it that
[2:05:27] way because I don't want to put one as
[2:05:30] more important than the other but but if
[2:05:33] I did I would lean on the message as
[2:05:35] being the most important but I'm
[2:05:37] encouraging you that hearing your pastor
[2:05:40] is not enough you've got to add to that
[2:05:44] the Simplicity of the message of the
[2:05:47] hour and let that truth get in you so
[2:05:50] that when you come to church and you
[2:05:52] hear some of that you recognize it and
[2:05:55] it rings in your heart and it gets
[2:05:58] driven deeper into the recesses of your
[2:06:01] faith and you quit living a life by
[2:06:04] feeling amen and and only choosing to
[2:06:08] live it by by faith it's
[2:06:13] necessary he goes on to say are you so
[2:06:16] foolish and so
[2:06:18] senseless oh my
[2:06:22] well I've seen you pretty mad brother
[2:06:24] Shelly you you you have said some rough
[2:06:35] things just make note if I ever come and
[2:06:37] say you silly
[2:06:39] senseless bunch of foolish
[2:06:42] people I've either really been with God
[2:06:45] or I've really Moved In the Flesh and
[2:06:47] have nothing else to
[2:06:49] say but I'm going to try my best not to
[2:06:51] call you foolish senseless or
[2:06:54] silly
[2:06:57] uhoh that did remind me of a word that
[2:06:59] somebody got you silly boy but anyway
[2:07:01] moving right
[2:07:03] along are you so foolish so senseless
[2:07:06] and so silly having begun your new life
[2:07:10] spiritually with the Holy Spirit are you
[2:07:12] now reaching
[2:07:15] Perfection by
[2:07:16] dependence on the Flesh on the
[2:07:22] law on the keeping of a
[2:07:28] ritual you know sometimes people say we
[2:07:31] we don't have communion
[2:07:33] enough uh well that's because we're
[2:07:35] wanting to teach people that communion
[2:07:39] is not to be a
[2:07:40] ritual it's to be a
[2:07:42] reminder real communion cannot take
[2:07:45] place one Sunday a month or once a
[2:07:49] quarter or as the Church of Christ every
[2:07:52] week they take Bread and Wine that's not
[2:07:54] what real communion is real communion is
[2:07:56] your fellowship with
[2:07:59] him so we're not just working on
[2:08:01] drinking a cup and eating a piece of
[2:08:03] bread and washing one another's feet
[2:08:05] we're working on having daily fellowship
[2:08:07] with him so that when we do go through
[2:08:10] the the the beauty of of a of a of the
[2:08:13] Lord's Supper The Last Supper the
[2:08:15] communion when we do go through the the
[2:08:17] beauty of that ceremony it means way
[2:08:20] more to
[2:08:21] us because we realize that it's more
[2:08:24] than Bread and
[2:08:26] Wine it's an impartation of life and
[2:08:29] strength and healing and we can have
[2:08:32] that as often as we come to his table if
[2:08:35] you believe that say amen amen let me
[2:08:37] paraphrase this verse before we go to a
[2:08:39] quotation and and it's simply this did
[2:08:42] you think for one minute that you could
[2:08:45] finish in the
[2:08:47] flesh what was started in the spirit
[2:08:53] you know a church that's born by the
[2:08:57] spirit of
[2:08:58] Christ a church that comes about by a
[2:09:03] spiritual inspiration or Vision cannot
[2:09:07] be propped up by the works of the
[2:09:11] flesh by having more
[2:09:14] programs by having more Vacation Bible
[2:09:17] schools by having more Sunday School
[2:09:19] classes by doing doing more churchy
[2:09:22] things by having Packa pews and all of
[2:09:25] the different festivals and things that
[2:09:27] the modern church is so involved in how
[2:09:29] many of you know you can't promote In
[2:09:31] the
[2:09:32] Flesh what was started in the spirit if
[2:09:36] you're going to finish something you've
[2:09:38] got to finish it like it was
[2:09:40] started we're here because of the holy
[2:09:43] spirit's leadership and now we've got to
[2:09:45] depend on that not less and less and
[2:09:48] less we've got to depend on it more and
[2:09:52] more and more and
[2:09:55] more Holiness is not something we can
[2:09:58] legislate no sir no it's not the keeping
[2:10:02] of the rules or the wearing of a uniform
[2:10:06] and I'm one of the most conservative
[2:10:08] among
[2:10:09] you I see things often that I don't
[2:10:13] understand in God's
[2:10:15] people I don't understand why God's
[2:10:18] people want to to to wear some of the
[2:10:20] things they wear and do some of the
[2:10:22] things they they do I don't understand
[2:10:24] it I don't understand why any married
[2:10:27] woman would want to squeeze herself into
[2:10:31] something that wasn't her size it must
[2:10:34] be about a number I encourage you to
[2:10:36] ignore the
[2:10:38] number and live
[2:10:40] Godly I I could go on and on you know me
[2:10:44] and you know my pet peeves but those
[2:10:47] things observing those things and
[2:10:50] practic iing those things don't finish
[2:10:53] us
[2:10:54] spiritually they they set us apart and
[2:10:58] they they testify of our dedication but
[2:11:01] it's only by the leadership of the holy
[2:11:03] spirit that we come to completion the
[2:11:06] only way we're going to manifest full
[2:11:08] adoption is to keep listening to the
[2:11:09] Holy Ghost he'll never lead you off the
[2:11:14] word he'll always lead you back to the
[2:11:17] word every single time if you believe
[2:11:20] that amen amen now this is a this is a
[2:11:24] lengthy one are you ready maybe one more
[2:11:26] we might even close we probably won't
[2:11:29] but we might there's always the
[2:11:31] possibility paragraph 176 I added this
[2:11:34] one this morning it's a little longer
[2:11:36] but I want to get it in here and then
[2:11:38] we'll try to to give you just a little
[2:11:42] uh earlier
[2:11:44] checkout and every word in the Bible is
[2:11:48] God's
[2:11:50] thoughts laying
[2:11:55] in well if I have the Bible why do I
[2:11:58] even need a
[2:11:59] message why do I even need the
[2:12:01] leadership of a prophet why do I even
[2:12:03] need a five-fold Ministry because the
[2:12:06] reality is that every word in the Bible
[2:12:09] is God's thoughts laying there in seed
[2:12:12] form you see all of God's thoughts are
[2:12:16] not contained in that book that's right
[2:12:19] that's hard to hear sometimes
[2:12:21] but remember what the Bible said if all
[2:12:24] the works of Jesus were written in a
[2:12:27] book The World itself could not contain
[2:12:31] the volumes so God is constantly
[2:12:34] thinking if you think that God quit
[2:12:38] thinking that's a lot of thinking if you
[2:12:41] think you know
[2:12:44] what I'm going to finish this thought
[2:12:46] because I happen to know that you're
[2:12:48] going to understand me
[2:12:51] if you think that God quit thinking in
[2:12:57] 1965 or or if you think that God quit
[2:13:00] thinking uh after the early church
[2:13:02] passed from the
[2:13:04] scene you're very
[2:13:07] mistaken he is constantly thinking sir
[2:13:12] aren't you glad to know in your heart
[2:13:13] that in some of those
[2:13:15] thoughts he still thinks about us we're
[2:13:18] not only a part of the original thoughts
[2:13:20] of God we're in his thoughts maybe we
[2:13:23] could say daily all the time he's
[2:13:26] thinking about us aren't you
[2:13:29] glad so the the written word that we
[2:13:33] have and even the message of the hour
[2:13:35] that has that has certainly uh developed
[2:13:38] the
[2:13:39] seed and caused much more understanding
[2:13:44] to
[2:13:45] come yet that those books recorded there
[2:13:49] from Genesis to Revelation it's only a
[2:13:52] portion of the thoughts that God has had
[2:13:55] so you've got to understand then that if
[2:13:58] receiv received into the human being the
[2:14:01] the seed of God's
[2:14:04] thoughts and spoke by the same thought
[2:14:07] that materialized the
[2:14:10] Bible that's what brings the thing to
[2:14:15] pass now to simplify that just a moment
[2:14:18] it it requires a spiritual
[2:14:21] inspiration to fall in your life on that
[2:14:25] seed of God's word to Quicken it to life
[2:14:30] and that's called a revelation and if
[2:14:32] you're under the impression that only
[2:14:34] prophets can receive Revelation or only
[2:14:36] pastors can receive Revelation you
[2:14:38] you've not understood the message very
[2:14:40] well God wants you to have Revelation he
[2:14:43] wants to fall he wants that button of
[2:14:46] life in you to bring that word that's
[2:14:48] laying in seed form in you to Quicken
[2:14:50] that and cause that begin to grow and
[2:14:53] push out all the unbelief okay he said
[2:14:56] and spoke by the same thought that
[2:14:58] materialize the Bible that's what brings
[2:15:00] the thing to pass he said see what I
[2:15:03] mean how powerful could the church be
[2:15:07] here hear this how powerful could the
[2:15:10] church be the Bible said let this mind
[2:15:14] be in you this mind that was in Christ
[2:15:17] be in you as a man thinketh in his heart
[2:15:23] so is
[2:15:25] he that's
[2:15:29] powerful that works in the positive and
[2:15:32] it works in the negative it even works
[2:15:35] carnally as a man thinks in his mind
[2:15:38] because this word heart here is not the
[2:15:41] blood
[2:15:42] pump this word heart here in the Bible
[2:15:45] is the seed of the emotions which would
[2:15:47] be the
[2:15:48] mind so let this
[2:15:51] this mind that was in Christ be in you
[2:15:55] because as a man thinketh in his heart
[2:15:57] or mind so is he he said now your
[2:16:02] thoughts if they become expression just
[2:16:06] a few more minutes he said like God said
[2:16:09] let there be a world before it could be
[2:16:11] a word it had to be a a thought so God
[2:16:15] in the creation created the world by his
[2:16:19] thought first then spoke it and the
[2:16:23] thought expressed the thought became
[2:16:27] material and he's asking the
[2:16:29] congregation see what I mean he said now
[2:16:32] if that same spirit that said let there
[2:16:35] be light and there was light that said
[2:16:37] let there be trees and there was trees
[2:16:40] and if that same mind that was in Christ
[2:16:42] be in you how much could it say
[2:16:48] Amen Let There be no cancer
[2:16:52] and it would be
[2:16:53] gone now a lot of us find this hard to
[2:16:56] believe because we have loved ones who
[2:16:58] have died with cancer and I want you to
[2:17:01] understand you cannot let that grief and
[2:17:04] loss cause you to believe that God is
[2:17:07] not still a Healer that he's still that
[2:17:10] he's not still a miracle worker and that
[2:17:12] he cannot banish cancer from your body
[2:17:15] he absolutely can and he
[2:17:19] will but he does it by the same spirit
[2:17:22] that said let there be
[2:17:24] light that same spirit that lives in you
[2:17:27] he said and it would be gone let the
[2:17:29] blind eyes be open and what it would be
[2:17:32] so are you still with me he said see
[2:17:36] it's your
[2:17:37] thought Jesus said verily you said that
[2:17:41] was Jesus that was Jesus but wait a
[2:17:43] minute he said have faith in God for
[2:17:46] verily verily I say unto you if you
[2:17:47] shall say to this mountain be moved
[2:17:49] pucked up and cast in into the sea and
[2:17:51] don't doubt it in your heart but believe
[2:17:54] that what you say will come to pass
[2:17:56] you'll have whatever things thou
[2:18:02] sayest is that right you shall have it
[2:18:06] not me you this is brother brandom said
[2:18:08] not me you you shall have it what power
[2:18:13] has been
[2:18:14] given I want to hear you say that to
[2:18:19] the not just to the pastor not just to
[2:18:22] the prophet not just to the fivefold
[2:18:24] ministry not just to an elder or a
[2:18:26] deacon or a trust to the
[2:18:29] church that now you can express it by
[2:18:32] mental conception but if it becomes a
[2:18:35] real revelation of God that you see it
[2:18:38] before it happened and express it in
[2:18:40] word form that word takes a hold this is
[2:18:45] huge I I got to slow down just a second
[2:18:48] because this is big
[2:18:51] before it happened and express it in
[2:18:53] word form that word takes a hole and
[2:18:57] becomes what a word expressed a thought
[2:19:00] excuse me a thought expressed your heart
[2:19:02] and your mind is so and filled with
[2:19:05] God's spirit until your thoughts
[2:19:09] become let me tell you something if your
[2:19:11] thoughts are his thoughts you're never
[2:19:14] in total anguish
[2:19:20] you're just not a nervous
[2:19:23] Rick when you find yourself and I'm a
[2:19:25] nervous person by nature and I know my
[2:19:30] limits and my family doesn't always know
[2:19:32] my limits but I know my limits and when
[2:19:35] I'm peopled
[2:19:36] out these may be the most wonderful
[2:19:38] people in all the world but when my
[2:19:41] nerves get bad I I I serve people better
[2:19:44] by being
[2:19:45] absent so I know what it means to be
[2:19:48] nervous I know what it means to F
[2:19:51] despair just like a lot of you know you
[2:19:54] understand it but I also know that I
[2:19:57] have to even though I was sort of made
[2:19:59] that way I have to have charge over that
[2:20:02] and I can't just Let It Go like a wild
[2:20:05] horse it'll take me to depression it'll
[2:20:08] take me to a
[2:20:10] prescription it'll take me to a
[2:20:13] hospital with locks on the door and pads
[2:20:15] on the
[2:20:18] wall it's my responsibility as a
[2:20:21] Believer even though I was made to be a
[2:20:24] sensitive and nervous person it's my
[2:20:26] responsibility as a Believer to to to to
[2:20:29] harness that so that it serves
[2:20:34] me God didn't do it to me because he
[2:20:37] doesn't love me he made me that way
[2:20:40] because he loves me and really it's a
[2:20:44] gift if I take charge over that I can
[2:20:47] actually use that to turn my faith loose
[2:20:52] because if you become more sensitive to
[2:20:54] troubles and trials you also have a
[2:20:57] tendency to to be more sensitive to the
[2:20:59] Supernatural and to the spiritual
[2:21:01] brother brandom explained to us
[2:21:04] this when he called himself a nervous
[2:21:07] person and he said uh also that he was
[2:21:10] prone to
[2:21:13] complexes he had a tendency to build
[2:21:17] complexes hello so you're in good
[2:21:20] company
[2:21:22] folks you're in good company he had to
[2:21:26] harness those
[2:21:28] thoughts you and I have to take
[2:21:31] authority over those thoughts and we
[2:21:34] have to push them into submission to the
[2:21:36] word to the blood to the name of Jesus
[2:21:39] Christ we have to take our nervousness
[2:21:42] if that's how we were created and we
[2:21:44] have to use
[2:21:45] it to make us have better contact with
[2:21:50] the other side and there are many
[2:21:53] believers who can have that kind of an
[2:21:55] experience simply because they learn to
[2:21:58] put a harness on their on their
[2:22:00] nervousness and they and they began to
[2:22:02] learn how to use that to serve Faith
[2:22:05] instead of fear and we must do it we as
[2:22:10] humans in this last hour are probably
[2:22:12] mostly all um prone to complexes of one
[2:22:15] kind or another we have inferiority
[2:22:18] complexes and we have you know all these
[2:22:20] issues that we have to deal with in fact
[2:22:23] I found a great comfort in knowing that
[2:22:24] brother brandham struggled that way and
[2:22:27] God gave him Victory and God is no
[2:22:30] respector of persons and he may not take
[2:22:33] all of that from you because he may have
[2:22:35] placed some of it there for his glory
[2:22:37] but you've got to learn to use that to
[2:22:39] utilize that so that it takes you back
[2:22:42] to faith and not to
[2:22:47] panic I'll give you a very carnal simple
[2:22:51] example that I've used before honey
[2:22:53] which one of it which one of the
[2:22:55] children got hurt in the in the yard and
[2:22:58] come up on the porch and they were they
[2:23:00] were bleeding and it was either Benjamin
[2:23:02] or I mean Joshua was always hurting
[2:23:08] himself but this time it was Benjamin he
[2:23:11] was the first and boy you you really do
[2:23:13] Panic then when the first one comes and
[2:23:17] he hurt himself out in the yard and I
[2:23:19] guess what I did I'm a dad and I'm a
[2:23:22] nervous person and I didn't go to Faith
[2:23:25] immediately oh I would going to pray for
[2:23:27] him don't worry about it I knew I had to
[2:23:29] pray for him after I
[2:23:31] panicked we got to put that in Reverse
[2:23:34] we got to switch the order of that and
[2:23:36] maybe if we pray in faith we don't even
[2:23:38] have to panic but I I just exclaimed out
[2:23:42] loud I'm standing on the porch and I
[2:23:44] said oh you we're never Stacy we are
[2:23:48] never going to let him play in theard
[2:23:50] start
[2:23:53] again isin't that the dumbest thing
[2:23:55] you've ever heard in your life she just
[2:23:58] looked at me
[2:24:01] like you've got to be
[2:24:04] kidding in that moment the only thing I
[2:24:07] could do is is is just Proclaim we're
[2:24:10] going to we're going to bubble wrap
[2:24:13] him and keep him in in locked inside so
[2:24:17] that he never gets hurt again how many
[2:24:19] of you know how absolutely ignorant that
[2:24:22] sounds that's not the way life works but
[2:24:25] that's how I
[2:24:27] work I have a tendency to to jump to
[2:24:30] some conclusion like that and the minute
[2:24:33] it comes out of my
[2:24:35] mouth I know how stupid it
[2:24:38] sounds but what we have to learn to do
[2:24:41] is is hopefully pull that down before we
[2:24:44] express it if you don't want to get
[2:24:46] laughed at you better control that
[2:24:48] before it comes out of your lips
[2:24:50] we're built that way but we have to
[2:24:52] learn to control that and we have to
[2:24:55] rather go immediately to
[2:24:58] Faith so not only is God going to help
[2:25:01] you with the blood that's gushing out of
[2:25:02] your
[2:25:03] body he's going to protect you in the
[2:25:06] future and we're going to do our part
[2:25:09] but it's up to God ultimately to keep us
[2:25:12] all safe come on and if we live so
[2:25:16] cautiously that we find ourselves in
[2:25:18] fear we will Miss so much of life that
[2:25:23] God has set aside for us do you believe
[2:25:26] that he said oh my how God see your
[2:25:29] heart and your mind is so filled with
[2:25:31] God's spirit until your thoughts become
[2:25:33] his thoughts let's go on why don't we
[2:25:36] have the musicians to come there you are
[2:25:39] when your mind and your leading and your
[2:25:43] guiding becomes a direct place or a
[2:25:47] direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit
[2:25:51] that's moving your mortal being oh I
[2:25:56] want to live locked in that
[2:26:00] place that my
[2:26:02] decisions are based on the inspiration
[2:26:05] of the
[2:26:06] spirit and not
[2:26:09] panic he said oh my let's go on what
[2:26:14] kind of a people should we be if the
[2:26:17] very Holy Spirit has you so embodied or
[2:26:22] empowered that you don't use your own
[2:26:25] thoughts you don't use your own mind you
[2:26:29] don't use
[2:26:34] your I'm I got to look around I'm not
[2:26:36] sure you're
[2:26:39] listening you know the original title of
[2:26:42] these notes was a lot rougher than how I
[2:26:45] I cleaned it up and I called it real
[2:26:47] Christians forget their feelings
[2:26:50] but after reading all the quotes I won't
[2:26:52] get to them this morning but after
[2:26:53] reading all the things that the prophet
[2:26:55] said about feelings I originally called
[2:26:57] this real Christians don't have
[2:27:01] feelings I've already given you Grace
[2:27:03] this
[2:27:04] morning and I've said we forget our
[2:27:06] feelings but if you add all these
[2:27:09] quotations together you'll come away
[2:27:10] with the sense that we must not
[2:27:13] entertain them for more than an
[2:27:17] nanosecond because if we do they'll
[2:27:19] control us
[2:27:22] you know we we set people up we ask
[2:27:24] people all the time how are you
[2:27:26] feeling how are you
[2:27:28] feeling so do you really want the answer
[2:27:32] I hope you do because there's some
[2:27:34] people if you ever ask them that you
[2:27:36] better pull up a
[2:27:39] chair cuz they've got more ailments my
[2:27:42] granny used to say this she said they've
[2:27:43] got more ailments than Carter has
[2:27:47] pills that was a manufacturer of
[2:27:49] medication at one time and they'll just
[2:27:52] spill that that's not really what you
[2:27:53] wanted to know is it you didn't really
[2:27:55] want to know every ingrown toenail and
[2:27:58] every come on you didn't really want to
[2:27:59] know that you know the Jews really have
[2:28:02] a better concept of how to greet one
[2:28:05] another they use the same word for hello
[2:28:08] that they use for
[2:28:11] goodbye they just say
[2:28:13] shalom when you say it one time as a
[2:28:17] greeting it means how is your your peace
[2:28:21] it's a question how is your
[2:28:24] peace and you can answer one of two ways
[2:28:28] you but most people their first response
[2:28:30] is
[2:28:32] beset and in Hebrew beset means in
[2:28:37] order so how are your feelings uh
[2:28:40] brother Ellas and your answer would be
[2:28:44] they're in
[2:28:46] order that really is not saying that he
[2:28:50] don't have some awful
[2:28:52] feelings it just means I'm taking God at
[2:28:56] his word and I'm putting them by his
[2:28:59] grace in order so that my feelings serve
[2:29:04] me instead of me serving my feelings do
[2:29:07] you understand and then when saying
[2:29:09] goodbye they usually say it double
[2:29:12] shalom
[2:29:13] shalom which really means may God double
[2:29:16] your peace as you go forward
[2:29:20] now we ought to be a little more careful
[2:29:23] by putting so much emphasis on how
[2:29:26] somebody feels because the prophet
[2:29:29] simply said it this way what do feelings
[2:29:34] matter when someone says I don't feel
[2:29:36] like it he said what does that have to
[2:29:39] do with
[2:29:40] anything it it's not about our feeling
[2:29:43] it's about our faith how is your
[2:29:46] faith somebody say beset her it's in
[2:29:50] order it's in order because it's a gift
[2:29:53] to you yes sir now you don't use your
[2:29:57] own mind your own thoughts and you this
[2:30:00] is the this is the
[2:30:01] kicker you don't use your own
[2:30:05] opinions that's
[2:30:08] hard some of us are no ad
[2:30:11] alls I'm a tendency to be that way and
[2:30:14] and I have an opinion about
[2:30:16] everything but you've got to come like I
[2:30:19] do into a place where we let the Holy
[2:30:21] Spirit direct the situation instead of
[2:30:23] our own mind and our own thoughts and
[2:30:26] our own opinion because God has
[2:30:31] something I could go a little deeper but
[2:30:33] I'm going to spare you this morning save
[2:30:36] it for another time he said but the Holy
[2:30:38] Spirit has you so
[2:30:40] built until your thoughts and your being
[2:30:44] is God's spirit expressing
[2:30:46] itself through
[2:30:48] you if God's spirit is expressing itself
[2:30:52] through you God's spirit never
[2:30:59] panics never
[2:31:02] panics it never
[2:31:05] despairs God's spirit always leads us to
[2:31:08] truth in every situation let me tell you
[2:31:11] something no matter what situation you
[2:31:13] find yourself in God has already
[2:31:16] prepared a way out and a solution to
[2:31:18] that problem if we can learn to trust
[2:31:20] him in that
[2:31:23] moment he said but the Holy Spirit has
[2:31:26] you so built into your thoughts and your
[2:31:27] being is God's spirit expressing itself
[2:31:30] through you what kind of a church would
[2:31:33] we be that's that's that question is too
[2:31:35] big to answer isn't it he said what kind
[2:31:39] of a people would we be if this morning
[2:31:42] if this brandom Tabernacle was so filled
[2:31:46] with the presence of God when you didn't
[2:31:49] even use your own
[2:31:52] mind I mean I'm going to give you the
[2:31:54] obvious
[2:31:55] example your mind says you better take
[2:31:59] it easy this
[2:32:01] morning you've just had
[2:32:04] surgery that's what your mind says your
[2:32:06] mind's not always
[2:32:08] wrong sometimes your mind will tell you
[2:32:10] the
[2:32:12] truth that's our thoughts it's my
[2:32:15] thoughts it's your thoughts but how many
[2:32:18] of you know that sometimes the spirit
[2:32:21] has a different
[2:32:23] mind and he says you've so honored me by
[2:32:27] your sacrifice that I'm going to bless
[2:32:29] you with an
[2:32:31] experience that'll hold on you'll hold
[2:32:34] on to it and it'll hold on to you a lot
[2:32:36] longer than that
[2:32:40] recovery let me tell you something I've
[2:32:42] been around long enough and I've told
[2:32:44] you multiple times that I've seen people
[2:32:47] who found themselves Le yielding to the
[2:32:49] leadership ship of the spirit doing
[2:32:51] Supernatural
[2:32:53] things things that defy the laws of
[2:32:56] nature because God was in it the one
[2:33:00] thing I want to advise you in this house
[2:33:02] and I have for years is if it's the
[2:33:05] spirit of
[2:33:06] God you'll be protected you'll be
[2:33:11] kept you're not going to bring harm to
[2:33:13] yourself you're not going to bring harm
[2:33:15] to anybody else if you yield to the
[2:33:18] spirit of God I I will tell you if
[2:33:20] you're not in the spirit and somebody is
[2:33:22] it might be a good idea to
[2:33:26] move cuz I was a little boy sitting on
[2:33:29] the front Pew in front of my grandmother
[2:33:31] she was a big woman and she'd get in the
[2:33:33] spirit and she'd sling her
[2:33:35] hands and I'm sitting on the Pew in
[2:33:37] front of her and more than once she put
[2:33:40] me out on the floor NOS
[2:33:45] First Once I could get up from the shock
[2:33:48] of being put out on the floor as a
[2:33:50] little boy in the front of the church
[2:33:52] I'd crawl back up on the Pew and I'd
[2:33:54] look at my granny like my goodness you
[2:33:56] knocked me in the floor and she'd look
[2:33:58] down and smile and she'd say you'll be
[2:34:01] all right you just need to be in the
[2:34:13] spirit don't even use your own mind your
[2:34:15] own
[2:34:17] thoughts you're so in tune so so filled
[2:34:20] with the presence of
[2:34:22] God he said didn't even have no ultimate
[2:34:26] of your
[2:34:28] own now that is a strange
[2:34:32] word especially in this
[2:34:35] context it
[2:34:36] means the Last
[2:34:39] Stand or the Final
[2:34:44] Chapter when I read that I I I pondered
[2:34:47] on I thought where did Brother brandham
[2:34:50] get that word and why did he use it
[2:34:54] here it's not a common word I wasn't
[2:34:58] 100% sure it was a word until I looked
[2:35:01] it up then I had to play a video to see
[2:35:04] how to say it and I may not have
[2:35:07] pronounced it right and I'm and I go
[2:35:09] back and I read this in context he said
[2:35:12] you don't have your own mind you don't
[2:35:13] use your own thoughts you don't even
[2:35:17] have you don't even have your last
[2:35:20] chapter figured out or your final
[2:35:24] stand because here's the
[2:35:27] reality your story what you're going
[2:35:30] through right now may not turn
[2:35:33] out like you
[2:35:38] planned forgive me for using this
[2:35:40] example again but sister Flo take it up
[2:35:44] with her because she told me on the
[2:35:47] phone this week don't you
[2:35:51] apologize for talking about your family
[2:35:55] and don't you apologize for talking
[2:35:57] about your
[2:35:59] granddaughter everybody else talks about
[2:36:01] their family you can talk about yours
[2:36:04] and you said if if they didn't like it
[2:36:06] they could come see
[2:36:10] you so I'm hiding behind sister Flo
[2:36:16] today and and showing you this and and
[2:36:19] this was what was really so powerful
[2:36:22] about Jenna's decision to to to to start
[2:36:25] at home to have the baby at home she
[2:36:27] said but now I'm not going to be
[2:36:32] crushed I'm going to do whatever I need
[2:36:36] to do whatever I have to do I want to
[2:36:40] have a healthy
[2:36:42] baby see but I'm sure that in our minds
[2:36:48] we expected it all to go like the like
[2:36:51] the Final Chapter that we had
[2:36:54] imagined The Last Stand would be may
[2:36:57] take a long time but eventually on the
[2:37:00] other side of this there's going to be a
[2:37:02] baby well there was we were right about
[2:37:05] something but what we didn't know is
[2:37:08] something that God knew God knows what
[2:37:10] we don't know and he knew that there
[2:37:14] there had to be a miracle one way or the
[2:37:18] other see sister Sharon brought a lot of
[2:37:20] clarity to me personally when she said
[2:37:23] and I'm giving away the
[2:37:25] punchline when she said to me don't you
[2:37:28] know that if God would have wanted to he
[2:37:30] could have untangled that
[2:37:32] cord that was wrapped around that baby's
[2:37:35] neck not once not twice but three
[2:37:37] times don't you know that God could have
[2:37:40] untangled that cord he could but then
[2:37:43] all of you would have wondered why did
[2:37:46] it have to be this way when labor was so
[2:37:50] long and so intense and even made worse
[2:37:54] by
[2:37:56] drugs you began to wonder why Lord so
[2:37:59] much
[2:38:01] suffering and then when the doctor
[2:38:03] stands there and says to you somebody
[2:38:06] was looking out for you all
[2:38:09] today and and he wanted to bring the
[2:38:13] news not only to Benjamin and Jenna he
[2:38:16] asked for permission to come out and
[2:38:18] speak to the family
[2:38:21] and the emotion of hearing that kind of
[2:38:24] an announcement when he says the right
[2:38:27] call was
[2:38:28] made he gave honor to the Midwife that
[2:38:31] said it's time to transfer to the
[2:38:33] hospital he gave honor to the mom and
[2:38:36] dad who made the final decision it's
[2:38:38] okay we've got to go ahead and just let
[2:38:40] it play out we don't really control the
[2:38:44] ultimate or the
[2:38:46] ultim
[2:38:48] ultimate is that close Timothy we don't
[2:38:52] control the final stand or the last
[2:38:55] chapter and you know what we don't have
[2:38:58] to because the one we put our hope and
[2:39:00] our trust in knows the end from the
[2:39:04] beginning and that's where we got to
[2:39:06] pull our opinion out it ain't easy but
[2:39:09] we got to do it we got to pull our own
[2:39:11] thoughts out and we've got to
[2:39:13] say I still trust you I've got to
[2:39:17] close there's a song I like to sing I
[2:39:21] haven't sung it in years I certainly
[2:39:23] won't try this morning I used to sing it
[2:39:24] with the
[2:39:25] trio it was written by a Jesus named
[2:39:30] preacher whose name was Reverend
[2:39:34] McFall he's deceased now and I think at
[2:39:38] least one of his sons maybe both of his
[2:39:40] sons are gone his daughter is still a
[2:39:43] part of the of the worship team at POA
[2:39:46] the Pentecostals of of Alexandria
[2:39:49] she has a dynamic
[2:39:53] voice
[2:39:55] their daughter maybe their son and
[2:39:58] daughter-in-law I think it was their son
[2:40:00] and
[2:40:02] daughter-in-law she had gone
[2:40:04] into labor I think is the story is right
[2:40:08] and was on her way to the
[2:40:11] hospital when they were suddenly
[2:40:17] struck by a drunk driver
[2:40:21] the
[2:40:22] dad the mom and the unborn child lost
[2:40:27] their
[2:40:29] lives I can't imagine that kind of pain
[2:40:33] can
[2:40:34] you brother McFall a preacher of the of
[2:40:37] the Jesus name message all over the
[2:40:40] country was forced with the
[2:40:43] decision I I I I I can either blame God
[2:40:48] or I can trust
[2:40:50] him I may not know the answer here but I
[2:40:54] know I'll know it in eternity and he
[2:40:56] chose to trust God and he wrote the song
[2:41:01] charity see if you can pull the words up
[2:41:03] I still trust you and let me read that
[2:41:06] to this congregation this morning it'll
[2:41:08] be a whole lot more pleasant than me
[2:41:09] trying to sing
[2:41:14] it I know they're there somewhere I feel
[2:41:16] like they are I could probably find it
[2:41:18] in a book or if you pull it up on your
[2:41:20] phone I'll read it to the to the people
[2:41:24] but is the first verse I've seen the
[2:41:27] righteous
[2:41:30] forsaken give us just a moment forgive
[2:41:36] me yeah yeah yeah I see the righteous
[2:41:38] man suffer
[2:41:41] pain yeah that's okay and it looks
[2:41:45] like I've seen the righteous man suffer
[2:41:50] pain and it looks like the wicked would
[2:41:54] go free
[2:41:58] listen and in my
[2:42:01] frustration that just didn't seem right
[2:42:04] to me now put that in context a Godly
[2:42:08] son and daughter-in-law and an innocent
[2:42:10] little baby taken out by a drunk driver
[2:42:13] and he writes these words I've seen the
[2:42:16] righteous man suffer pain and I and it
[2:42:20] looked like the wicked would go
[2:42:23] free and in my frustration it just
[2:42:27] didn't seem right to
[2:42:32] me I ask you for Sunshine but you sent
[2:42:36] rain I cried for healing but I only got
[2:42:40] pain but I know your love will see me
[2:42:45] through
[2:42:47] Lord I still trust
[2:42:51] you the chorus I still Trust You Lord I
[2:42:55] still Trust You Lord I know you're able
[2:42:58] to guide me through this old dry Barren
[2:43:02] land and when I don't know which way to
[2:43:05] turn or go I still Trust You Lord does
[2:43:10] that speak to anybody else I still Trust
[2:43:14] You Lord so let me hold to your hand
[2:43:19] I trust you for you've been so faithful
[2:43:24] to
[2:43:24] me and you said in your word that you
[2:43:27] would never leave nor forsake me Lo I'll
[2:43:32] go with you unto the end your blood has
[2:43:36] cleansed me from all my guilt and sin
[2:43:39] your promise I know I can hold on to oh
[2:43:43] Lord I
[2:43:47] love I love
[2:43:49] love trusting
[2:43:52] you now you put those words in
[2:43:56] context and you'll see a man whose heart
[2:44:00] is broken whose emotions are
[2:44:05] arai whose mind is tormented with
[2:44:09] wise but he made a
[2:44:12] choice do I give up on God do I let
[2:44:16] bitterness consume me or do I do what
[2:44:19] I've preached to others to do do I just
[2:44:22] put my trust in you Lord even when I
[2:44:25] don't understand it is there anybody
[2:44:27] here today that has something in your
[2:44:30] heart in your life in your situation in
[2:44:34] your
[2:44:35] past that you just don't understand the
[2:44:40] wise and it torments your
[2:44:43] mind and eats at you emotionally if if
[2:44:47] you're here and and there's something
[2:44:50] that you can't quite get over I want to
[2:44:52] remind you that if you'll put your trust
[2:44:56] in the Lord he will roll you over the
[2:45:00] tide he'll bring you
[2:45:03] forward and
[2:45:05] through he could have taken you
[2:45:08] over he could have taken you
[2:45:11] around but it sounds like he chose to
[2:45:15] bring you
[2:45:16] through when I find myself myself in a
[2:45:20] crisis of
[2:45:21] faith and my peace is
[2:45:25] Disturbed it's in that particular
[2:45:29] moment that I have to pull my thoughts
[2:45:33] and opinions and feelings
[2:45:36] aside and I have to choose to put my
[2:45:39] hope and my trust in the
[2:45:43] Lord for he sees us through
[2:45:46] everything when my mind is
[2:45:50] reminded
[2:45:51] of running with my mother as a small boy
[2:45:56] from an abusive
[2:45:58] husband who had beat my
[2:46:01] mom to the point of almost being
[2:46:05] unconscious and I remember hiding with
[2:46:08] her in the bushes of the apartment where
[2:46:11] we lived and she was breathing so
[2:46:14] heavily from her pain and from her haste
[2:46:18] of getting me away from him and escaping
[2:46:21] herself she was breathing so heavy and
[2:46:24] my heart as a child was saying my mind
[2:46:28] wanted her to be quiet because I knew
[2:46:31] she was going to give our hiding spot
[2:46:34] away and he found
[2:46:37] us but
[2:46:39] Grace had already moved on the
[2:46:42] scene and the anger was gone and we went
[2:46:46] into that other repeated cycle of Shame
[2:46:50] and guilt those thoughts tormented me
[2:46:55] for so long but now when I
[2:46:57] remember my heart is filled with such
[2:47:00] gratitude and such
[2:47:02] Thanksgiving that God had a plan for us
[2:47:05] all along and in that hour my mother
[2:47:09] didn't know the Lord but she would come
[2:47:12] to know him and that was his grace and
[2:47:15] his
[2:47:16] Mercy at the time it certainly made no
[2:47:19] no sense would you stand with me when
[2:47:22] your mind uh goes back and you remember
[2:47:27] some of your stuff and your emotions are
[2:47:32] kicked in and
[2:47:33] renewed remember whose child you
[2:47:36] are remember that you have a papa who
[2:47:40] loves you and who has chosen the best
[2:47:44] for you and you've got to trust him
[2:47:48] you've got to trust him that it's all
[2:47:49] going to work out for his
[2:47:52] glory you've got to remember
[2:47:54] that all
[2:47:57] things do not
[2:47:59] originate with
[2:48:01] him but he allows
[2:48:04] things to mold us to shape us to advance
[2:48:10] us to a higher Faith to a deeper
[2:48:14] conviction if you're here and you
[2:48:16] struggle that way right where you are
[2:48:18] are if there's something that still
[2:48:20] plagues you and and you can almost feel
[2:48:23] the Panic that tries to come back
[2:48:26] there's nothing to be ashamed of Right
[2:48:28] Where You Are why don't you just lift up
[2:48:30] your hands and let me agree with you
[2:48:34] that God will heal
[2:48:36] that some of you have known
[2:48:39] abuse let me believe today that God will
[2:48:43] help you heal from
[2:48:45] that it wasn't good
[2:48:48] but it is working out somehow for your
[2:48:52] good because you're the called of the
[2:48:55] Lord father in the name of Jesus all
[2:48:59] over this building and around the
[2:49:02] streaming
[2:49:04] congregation I pray right now for those
[2:49:06] who carry
[2:49:09] trauma not only in their mind but even
[2:49:12] in the cells of their
[2:49:14] body because medically and
[2:49:16] scientifically we know that even our
[2:49:19] cells can absorb and carry trauma that
[2:49:23] will trouble us many years later I pray
[2:49:27] right now that the Peace
[2:49:29] Speaker would draw near to every
[2:49:33] person that has that kind of a need
[2:49:37] right now and that you would whisper
[2:49:40] peace to Frid emotions and cells
[2:49:45] burdened down with the weight of trauma
[2:49:48] I ask that you would be Jehovah Rafa
[2:49:51] right now and that you would release
[2:49:55] healing that you would release healing
[2:49:58] to every heart and to every
[2:50:02] mind Lord I know that one moment in your
[2:50:07] presence can not only help us in the
[2:50:11] moment but it can strengthen us for the
[2:50:13] journey ahead and in a moment we're
[2:50:16] going to worship you
[2:50:19] and we're going to lift up your name
[2:50:21] again and your presence is here with us
[2:50:25] may we obsorb may we draw in may we
[2:50:30] breathe in the presence of the
[2:50:33] Lord uh until everything that we carry
[2:50:38] that still causes us grief and stress
[2:50:42] until all of that is ministered to by
[2:50:45] the Sweet Holy Ghost
[2:50:49] it's our desire Lord to live a free life
[2:50:52] and not be weighted down by what your
[2:50:55] blood is already dealt with so today I
[2:50:59] ask for a
[2:51:00] release I ask you to release each one of
[2:51:05] us into the freedom that your word has
[2:51:08] promised for
[2:51:09] us I ask you Lord to so fill us with
[2:51:15] forgiveness and Victory
[2:51:19] that our
[2:51:20] future is no longer
[2:51:23] dictated by our past only you can do it

[3:07:09] through you came through you protected
[3:07:11] our
[3:07:13] sister when there were many
[3:07:16] possibilities because of what she had

[3:08:57] him and to raise and rear him in the
[3:09:01] fear of the Lord knowing your word and
[3:09:04] your
[3:09:06] truth and I ask you to strengthen them

[3:17:00] next Saturday night and Sunday
[3:17:03] morning June 1st and 2nd will be our
[3:17:06] fellowship weekend and I assume that
[3:17:09] there will be Saints coming from other
[3:17:11] places and I've been a little busy the
[3:17:14] last few days and I haven't really kept
[3:17:16] up with who is coming our way
[3:17:18] but sometimes we think it'll just be us
[3:17:21] and and we get we get uh surprised and
[3:17:25] and we get happy every time because the
[3:17:27] Lord puts it on somebody's heart and and
[3:17:29] they come and I believe they will this
[3:17:31] time as well let's believe for a real
[3:17:34] breakthrough this coming weekend

[3:18:01] kisses that's hard to do I know it's
[3:18:05] hard to do but because they're brand new
[3:18:08] we want their we want their immune
[3:18:10] system to be able to

[3:18:19] blanket or whatever perhaps I don't know
[3:18:21] what the parents will will let you buy
