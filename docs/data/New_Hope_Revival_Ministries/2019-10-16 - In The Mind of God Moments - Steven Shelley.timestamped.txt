[0:00] in the mind of God today she operates in
[0:05] the fullness of her adoption Jesus was
[0:17] the fullness of God in a body you and I
[0:22] have a portion of God a portion of the
[0:28] great eternal Spirit of God living
[0:30] inside of us by the baptism of the Holy
[0:32] Ghost so we can already say that God
[0:36] lives within me right so the work that's
[0:41] going on now is to get man out of me
[0:44] get flesh out of me get so issues there
[0:47] within me so that I can live not from
[0:51] the natural life not from the flesh life
[0:54] not even from the soul life but from the
[0:57] spirit life which is a supernatural life
[1:00] which is a portion of the original
[1:02] pillar of fire that's what's living on
[1:06] the inside of us so God became men that
[1:13] we the fallen men of God men fallen sons
[1:18] of the earth could become the sons of
[1:22] God
[1:24] what does it mean to be a son of God you
[1:27] know it means to have his seed it means
[1:34] to have the seed of your father a sperma
[1:38] life inside of you if you have that
[1:45] sperma life that new birth life living
[1:52] inside of you then one of these days by
[1:56] His grace we will step with that life we
[2:00] will speak with that life we will think
[2:03] with that life we will function with
[2:05] that line that'll be the bride's finest
[2:07] hour I know that the way to get us there
[2:13] is to call it now it is and that's where
[2:17] people have a problem and that's because
[2:19] we've been so disappointed with what we
[2:23] have hoped and believed in thawed and
[2:24] expected and so we're in such a pickle
[2:28] that we we have a hard time declaring it
[2:32] to be as it really is but this is
[2:34] finished in the
[2:37] and of God we are seated today heavenly
[2:43] places in Christ Jesus in the mind of
[2:48] God
[2:49] today the bride has thus saith the Lord
[2:55] in the mind of God today she operates in
[3:01] the fullness of her adoption and the way
[3:06] to be able to demonstrate it and move
[3:10] forward into it is to call it into
[3:15] existence by faith
