[0:17] father it's at the appearing of the Lord
[0:22] Jesus Christ it's your faith that has
[0:25] been tried by the fire would be worthy
[0:27] of the well done he chooses to see what
[0:33] he saw about me
[0:35] that's mercy my love his grace take your
[0:40] place and take it now your family is at

[1:12] [Music]
[1:19] I'm going to preach on praise hi I know
[1:27] there are other subjects but I'm stuck
[1:30] on this one you talk about him and he
[1:35] comes when I shared that experience with
[1:39] you Tuesday night of the Lord riding
[1:41] coming to me and an experience riding on
[1:44] the praises of his people when I told
[1:46] you about that Tuesday night I went home
[1:48] and experienced something so similar
[1:51] just a slight few little differences in
[1:53] it experienced something so similar to
[1:56] that again that I thought to myself my
[1:59] if that's all it takes is sharing it to
[2:02] experience it and to have then I ought
[2:05] not to hold back at all there's nothing
[2:09] like the thought of the Lord riding
[2:12] coming to you and he's riding on the
[2:15] praises of his bride praise is important
[2:19] if you believe that say man some 22
[2:22] verse 1 my God my God why hast thou
[2:28] forsaken me
[2:31] this is not Jesus this is the psalmist
[2:35] why hast thou forsaken me why art thou
[2:40] so far from helping me and from the
[2:44] words of my roaring
[2:48] oh my god I cry in the daytime but thou
[2:55] here is not and in the night season and
[3:00] am not silent but thou art holy come on
[3:08] now thou art holy o thou that inhabited
[3:16] the praises of Israel hallelujah thou
[3:25] art holy
[3:29] this was a psalmist who said I cry out
[3:32] and I don't feel like you hear me I pray
[3:35] and I don't get any answer but thou art
[3:38] holy o thou that inhabited the praises
[3:45] of Israel he felt like if I can just
[3:50] praise him he'll come to me come on now
[3:54] if I can just praise him he'll come to
[3:58] me let's pray father I thank you this
[4:01] morning for the wonderful presence of
[4:04] the Lord I thank you for fasting and
[4:07] praying and those who have been seeking
[4:10] your face and we know Lord that's just a
[4:13] tiny little taste a tiny little touch of
[4:16] what you have for your people but Lord I
[4:19] so appreciate it and we are so thankful
[4:23] for the atmosphere that was created this
[4:26] morning I was reminded in the new song
[4:30] that we sung Lord there's no giant can
[4:35] stand before your people for the battle
[4:38] is yours the battle is yours and Lord we
[4:43] give you praise that the battle is yours
[4:46] you are the victor and you have given us
[4:50] the spoils of victory and we praise you
[4:53] this morning Lord we praise you from the
[4:59] bottom of all we are we lift up your
[5:03] holy name and we say God you are worthy
[5:07] to be praised hallelujah and when we
[5:12] leave this place give us grace to walk
[5:15] straight Lord give us grace to please
[5:20] you in our words in our life in our
[5:24] action and we'll give you glory and
[5:26] honor and praise for its in the
[5:29] wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[5:31] Yeshua our Messiah we pray amen
[5:34] you may be seated God delights in your
[5:41] praises
[5:46] in the old days it was a little bit hard
[5:50] to praise the Lord if you knew you
[5:54] weren't living right you know they just
[5:57] had this mentality and if you if you
[6:03] knew there were things in your life that
[6:05] ought not to be there well it was hard
[6:08] to praise the Lord because we heard all
[6:11] the time that God doesn't hear the
[6:14] prayer of sinners unless it's a prayer
[6:16] of repentance when will they got that
[6:18] might have been a scripture I can't help
[6:22] it it's in there but they emphasize that
[6:25] so much that people got this idea that
[6:29] in unless I know that everything is okay
[6:31] and I'm doing all I can and and there's
[6:35] nothing in me that would Mar me in any
[6:37] way until I get to that place I can't
[6:40] praise the Lord
[6:42] because if I do that's just like giving
[6:44] God dirty hands I don't believe that I
[6:48] want you to know this morning that I
[6:50] believe God delights in your praise he
[6:53] wants you to live right he wants you to
[6:56] walk in righteousness but I believe that
[6:59] God sees your praise if a sinner can pay
[7:05] his tithe and be blessed come on now if
[7:09] somebody who doesn't even serve the Lord
[7:11] can give God his part and receive a
[7:14] portion of the blessing that goes with
[7:16] that then I am convinced that you don't
[7:19] have to get clean enough to offer God a
[7:22] praise that he delights in he wants to
[7:26] hear you sing he wants to hear you
[7:29] praise Him and my granny used to say
[7:33] praise Him praise Him in advance
[7:39] praise Him before you get what you're
[7:42] looking for and she said if you do that
[7:47] God will store it up and when you're
[7:50] ready to get it it'll come but praise
[7:53] Him in advance and she also said
[7:57] she so many times God filled people with
[8:01] the Holy Ghost what she called on credit
[8:04] I said now granny I never read that in
[8:07] the Bible she said well I never read it
[8:09] in the Bible either but she said I've
[8:11] seen some of the meanest ungodly 'us
[8:15] rottenness people you'd ever want to
[8:18] know come and get saved ask the Lord to
[8:21] come into life and pray all the way
[8:23] through to the Holy Ghost in one service
[8:26] and there would be people sitting all
[8:29] over the building that had been seeking
[8:31] the Lord for the Holy Ghost 20 years and
[8:33] she said people would say sister Shelly
[8:36] why are they why would God do that
[8:38] because that man's got a lot to clean up
[8:41] or that woman's got to a lot to clean up
[8:44] and there they have prayed all the way
[8:47] through to the Holy Ghost she said well
[8:49] I don't know except that they touched
[8:51] the heart of God and he poured his
[8:53] spirit out and they hadn't been so
[8:55] hardened by religion that that they
[8:58] resisted what they felt and and they
[9:01] Annie she said maybe just fill them on
[9:03] credit because she said it takes a
[9:07] portion and it's true the scripture
[9:09] takes a portion of the Holy Ghost to
[9:11] start dealing and convicting see that's
[9:14] what the Baptist teach they believe you
[9:17] receive the Holy Spirit at repentance
[9:19] and if you didn't to receive another
[9:22] spirit at repentance you wouldn't have
[9:24] any strength to make any change in your
[9:27] life so they're not wrong that's why
[9:32] people say we're Baptists kostol because
[9:35] we believe that there is a place of
[9:37] eternal security in the word and that is
[9:41] not a license to sin but it's a grace to
[9:44] help you live the way you desire to live
[9:47] for him amen but I also believe that
[9:52] portion that you get in repentance it's
[9:55] not all there is for you I believe there
[9:58] is a baptism of the Holy Ghost that
[10:00] comes but they were preaching so hard in
[10:03] those days you can't get the Holy Ghost
[10:05] until you're sanctified you got to be
[10:08] sanctified I believe in that
[10:10] but I want you to know you can't
[10:12] sanctify yourself enough not enough he
[10:16] has to come and brother when he comes
[10:20] with that sanctifying portion of his
[10:23] spirit the things you once loved you
[10:25] don't love them anymore the things you
[10:28] once hated you now loved and you're like
[10:31] that that man that we sung about I knew
[10:34] my family didn't like it that way
[10:36] because I'd heard my uncle say that when
[10:38] he got religion he didn't act that way
[10:41] but I stumbled to the altar he went to
[10:45] watch and to see what other people were
[10:47] doing but something got ahold of him I
[10:50] believe that is the grace of God in our
[10:53] lives to help us get to the place where
[10:56] we can make a full surrender to Him how
[10:59] many of you're glad that the Spirit of
[11:00] the Lord is for you he's for you he's
[11:05] not against you you with me this is the
[11:08] psalmist and he is prophesying in song
[11:16] not only is he prophesying in song but
[11:19] he is walking in spiritual parallel he's
[11:22] walking in a prophetic gift whether he
[11:26] realizes in her heart and he is singing
[11:29] and prophesying the very words that
[11:33] Jesus will utter and they will be
[11:35] recorded from the cross my father my
[11:38] father my God my God why have you
[11:42] forsaken me and when you recognize that
[11:46] David was moving in the spirit even
[11:49] though a lot of bad things were going on
[11:52] in his life at the time God was still
[11:55] allowing him to move in that spirit and
[11:58] pick up the inspiration of Messianic
[12:01] prophecy I really appreciate that and
[12:03] when you realize that you look over the
[12:06] life of David and you see that there
[12:09] were some real parallels in David's life
[12:12] he really had some suffering to do
[12:15] before he rained didney though he made
[12:19] some huge mistakes I want you to know
[12:22] they were huge mistakes he committed
[12:25] adultery and then murder to cover up
[12:28] that adultery but let's know something
[12:30] else about David he came with a heart of
[12:33] repentance because in all of David's
[12:37] shortcoming he never lost his praise
[12:41] this is something that we need to
[12:44] realize he didn't say I'm too dirty to
[12:47] praise he didn't come to receive
[12:50] something in praise he came to give
[12:53] something I want you to know praise as
[12:56] your offering
[12:57] you're not praising to get you're
[13:00] praising to give you're giving something
[13:04] away when you praise the Lord Amen
[13:08] because David saw that God in habit
[13:13] dissed
[13:15] he inhabits the praises of his people he
[13:21] lives in our praise that word inhabited
[13:27] the word in Hebrew means to sit to
[13:32] remain to dwell it means to stay to
[13:38] tarry all those words he tarries in the
[13:42] praises of his people he stays in the
[13:46] praises of his people you understand the
[13:48] scripture he lives there in those
[13:51] praises but that same Hebrew word also
[13:55] means a seat a dwelling a throne God
[14:01] sits on a throne of our praises think
[14:07] about it
[14:08] so this is perhaps what I was seeing in
[14:12] that experience God sitting Jesus
[14:16] sitting on the praise of his bride
[14:19] riding in I want you to hear me riding
[14:23] in not riding out riding in he was
[14:26] coming our way he was coming toward us
[14:30] and what was bringing him was the
[14:34] praises of his bride when you get that
[14:38] in your spirit this morning your praise
[14:41] will take on a new purpose because
[14:45] you're giving something away when you
[14:47] praise the Lord but you're also
[14:49] providing him a place to rest a place to
[14:53] sit a place to dwell to tarry to abide
[14:59] the Hebrew word is a seat also or a
[15:02] throne you are allowing the Holy One to
[15:07] be in throw
[15:09] and in your praises you heard us the
[15:14] other day they put a clip out about that
[15:17] Ark of the Covenant that is within that
[15:22] is his throne in this hour this is where
[15:25] the Lord is you want to know where the
[15:26] Lord is sitting he's sitting in his
[15:29] bride come on he's with us and he's
[15:33] going to be with us until the end of
[15:36] this thing he's never going to leave us
[15:39] now how many of you believe that he's
[15:42] gonna be with us until that time of
[15:44] glorious resurrection when the dead in
[15:47] Christ will rise first and we which are
[15:50] alive we're going to be caught up
[15:52] together to meet the Lord and to meet
[15:55] them in the air
[15:57] do you still believe in the resurrection
[15:58] rapture I still believe in that so if
[16:02] you take that Hebrew word and you should
[16:06] use that to help you understand that
[16:08] verse it could easily be translated this
[16:11] way you are holy now let's not forget
[16:14] what he was saying I pray and you don't
[16:18] hear me I ask and I don't receive but
[16:23] thou art holy
[16:26] that sounds like a backer clear the day
[16:29] didn't it
[16:30] ho the fields are barren fig trees have
[16:33] no kasam everything is about to get
[16:37] worse yet ah will praise thee David
[16:43] saying something very similar here he is
[16:47] saying o my prayers just fall to the
[16:52] ground it seems but holy you are holy
[17:00] and you are in throne on the praises of
[17:05] Israel how many of you know your
[17:08] spiritual Israel you are spiritual
[17:12] Israel this morning no doubt about it
[17:14] and if God was enthroned on the praises
[17:17] of his Old Testament Israel he is
[17:20] certainly in thrown on the praises of
[17:23] his people under the New Covenant can
[17:25] you believe that
[17:26] I believe it he could sit anywhere that
[17:32] he wanted to see it he could dwell
[17:34] anywhere that he wanted to dwell but
[17:36] guess where he chooses to dwell to be
[17:40] enthroned in our praises when you praise
[17:46] the Lord
[17:47] you're giving him a place in your life
[17:51] you're inviting him to come and sit in
[17:55] the middle of your stuff there's some
[18:00] stuff here Lord that you're not gonna
[18:02] like but I need your help in getting rid
[18:07] of that stuff so I'm going to bring you
[18:11] in and allow you to be enthroned in my
[18:14] praise I'm not praising because I'm
[18:17] worthy I'm praising you because you are
[18:21] worthy you are worthy my praise is not
[18:25] about me it's about you it's about who
[18:29] you are it's about giving you a place to
[18:32] dwell to abide to remain to stay
[18:36] - Terry - take your seat in my life in
[18:40] psalm 55:17
[18:43] David said that he prayed three times a
[18:48] day now think about it three times a day
[18:55] evening and morning and at noon will I
[19:01] pray and cry aloud and he shall hear my
[19:08] voice same psalmist who said I pray and
[19:15] you don't hear me now he says I pray
[19:20] three times a day and you hear me
[19:25] I like it I like it because these songs
[19:31] were written at various times in David's
[19:35] life
[19:35] when he was going through different
[19:37] things and they reflect where he was in
[19:42] that particular moment just like your
[19:44] praise will at times it will reflect
[19:47] where you are in that moment but if I
[19:50] can find a place where David stopped
[19:54] praising the Lord I can't find it yet
[19:57] I'm still looking to find the place
[19:59] where he said life is just too tough I
[20:03] don't have any praise left in me I can't
[20:05] find that yet but I hear him saying over
[20:08] and over again I'm troubled I'm in dire
[20:13] straits
[20:14] I've got a lot of stuff going on but you
[20:18] are holy you are faithful as we heard
[20:25] son this morning you are good and I'm
[20:28] going to praise your name Saul is after
[20:33] him to kill him he is running for his
[20:36] life he will tell the story of some of
[20:41] his running and some of his hardship and
[20:44] yet in the midst of all of that like job
[20:48] in the midst of all that like job in the
[20:53] midst of some grumbling and a little bit
[20:55] of reflecting on how he feels
[20:57] mixed all in that song I will praise you
[21:03] Lord because you are wonderful and
[21:05] worthy you see David recognized my
[21:08] station changes my situation changes my
[21:13] feelings change my circumstances changed
[21:16] but my god he never changes oh he is
[21:21] always the same
[21:22] he is always faithful he is always good
[21:26] when there's more than enough he's God
[21:29] and when there's nothing he is still God
[21:33] and he's still able to provide
[21:36] David's you know his musing his
[21:42] reflection was certainly influenced by
[21:47] what he was going through but not his
[21:49] praise how many of you could agree with
[21:52] that you might find some little place
[21:54] where it's a little out of balance
[21:59] but there's a whole lot of blessing a
[22:02] whole lot of praising going on and
[22:05] there's some suffering going on in the
[22:08] Book of Psalms to let us know that the
[22:12] godly life the dedicated life the
[22:15] surrendered life it's not an easy life
[22:17] it's not a life with no hardship come on
[22:21] it's not a life with no heartache it's
[22:23] not a life with no suffering but God is
[22:26] good I want you to look at somebody and
[22:28] say look God is good tell them right now
[22:31] God is good he could sit anywhere in
[22:35] this world that he wants to sit give me
[22:38] just a little more in this monitor would
[22:39] you please he could sit anywhere in this
[22:42] world that he wants to sit but he
[22:45] chooses to sit right down in the middle
[22:47] of the praises of his people you want to
[22:51] bring God into this place
[22:54] why don't you help me preach you want to
[22:57] bring God into this plate do what you
[22:59] did this morning
[23:00] praising how you don't have to wait for
[23:04] somebody to call you up here you come up
[23:07] here when you want to I noticed that you
[23:10] were bringing a sacrifice of praise
[23:13] surely you didn't come in here feeling
[23:15] like that real praise is gonna cost you
[23:20] something are you with me
[23:26] evening morning at noon I will pray and
[23:31] he must have been Pentecostal because he
[23:34] said I'll cry loud he wasn't a silent
[23:38] prayer he led his petition he led his
[23:43] supplication they known he wasn't
[23:45] ashamed to pray three times a day I
[23:47] wonder if anybody has that discipline
[23:50] you're gonna make sure that you pray
[23:52] three times a day what if it was like a
[23:56] Daniels day where a decree is made you
[24:00] better not pray to that God and you do
[24:04] like David who has this discipline in
[24:06] his life to pray he doesn't get in the
[24:09] closet and shut the door did he no sir
[24:12] he went over and opened up the window so
[24:15] that all the Babylon could know that he
[24:18] would dare defy the decree of the king
[24:22] that's that's faithful David said I pray
[24:26] three times a day in the evening in the
[24:29] morning and at noon would you look at
[24:32] psalms 119 verse 164 and 165 that 119 is
[24:43] a long Psalm isn't it it's a big one
[24:46] look at 164 165
[24:51] seven times a day
[24:57] do i what let me hear you say it again
[25:02] seven times a day do I praise thee how
[25:06] many times did he say prayed evening
[25:11] morning at noon how many times did he
[25:15] say praised
[25:18] every day
[25:21] seven times a day do I praise thee
[25:24] because of thy righteous judgments who
[25:33] great peace have made the next verse
[25:38] great peace have they which love thy law
[25:43] and nothing huh nothing shall offend
[25:49] them
[25:52] I preached a message here not too long
[25:54] ago as some speakers say it went over
[25:58] like a rat sandwich nobody really wanted
[26:02] it
[26:04] but I preached a little message that
[26:07] said there's no room for feelings
[26:12] in the bride
[26:15] and nobody really wants to embrace that
[26:19] kind of an idea but a prophet was pretty
[26:22] clear you gotta be able I don't know how
[26:27] I don't know when but I know where the
[26:31] grace will come from I'm gonna keep
[26:36] looking to the hills until I can get to
[26:40] that place that nothing offends me how
[26:46] many of you will make the same
[26:47] commitment I'm gonna keep looking to the
[26:50] hills I'm gonna keep looking to where my
[26:53] help comes from I'm gonna keep leaning
[26:55] and depending on the faithful God the
[26:58] one who's chasing me down with his
[27:00] goodness I'm gonna keep depending on the
[27:02] grace that I know he has to drop it over
[27:05] in my life that nothing peace and grace
[27:09] that nothing would be able to offend me
[27:12] because I know that I'm one of his and I
[27:15] know that I'm one of those who love his
[27:16] law how many of you would like to have
[27:19] that grace that peace in your life that
[27:21] nothing offended you nothing even a lot
[27:26] of junk that goes on out there in the
[27:29] world that we take so personal sometime
[27:32] but if we're not careful it will put on
[27:36] us a political spirit I don't want that
[27:38] I don't want my reaction to what's going
[27:42] on out there to give me a critical
[27:44] political spirit that divides instead of
[27:49] brings us together we all have our
[27:51] opinion about what's going on but I'd
[27:53] like to be in a place where instead of
[27:56] being offended this world's messed up
[28:00] folks
[28:04] when we're offended we draw back so we
[28:10] don't want to be offended we want to be
[28:13] challenged we want to be convicted we
[28:17] want to be quickened
[28:20] we want to be moved but we don't want to
[28:23] be a people so easily offended and
[28:25] especially with one another come on now
[28:30] with one another
[28:34] I said to you I've got to have peace and
[28:37] grace it only comes from God I'm not
[28:40] there yet I'm closer there than I have
[28:43] been in time past but closer there this
[28:46] is not a game of horseshoes this is a
[28:48] game of wanting to go all the way great
[28:51] peace have they which love thy law and
[28:54] nothing shall offend them you love the
[28:57] law of God but nothing shall offend them
[29:00] but I want you to go back and show us
[29:04] the verse that leads to that seven times
[29:07] a day do I praise thee because of thy
[29:11] righteous judgments great peace after
[29:14] they which love thy law and nothing
[29:15] shall offend them do you think maybe
[29:20] praise it's part of the key to get to a
[29:25] place where you can move and rest and
[29:28] move in peace and move with a
[29:32] non-offending spirit have you ever
[29:35] thought about if we really praise the
[29:37] Lord with our life not with just our
[29:40] demonstration in church but but we need
[29:43] that but also our life if we praise him
[29:46] if we lift him up if he really dwells in
[29:49] our praises if he really comes to sit
[29:52] where we have prepared praise for him
[29:55] will he not bring the peace we're
[29:57] looking for won't he bring the grace we
[30:00] need to get over whatever it is we're
[30:02] walking through I believe he will I
[30:05] believe once again I can say praise is a
[30:08] key and how many times a day or the show
[30:13] how many times a day did he praise seven
[30:15] times a day how many times did he say
[30:18] prayed three
[30:26] that is at least twice as many times
[30:32] Watchmen II said praise is the highest
[30:36] work carried out by God's children let
[30:42] me say it again praise it's the highest
[30:45] work carried out by God's children does
[30:49] anybody know the history and story of
[30:51] watchman Nee and you know a little bit
[30:53] about it he's written some amazing very
[30:58] simple but very deep material he was
[31:02] imprisoned
[31:04] he suffered he really paid a price to
[31:09] teach his people the simplicity of the
[31:12] gospel he went through a lot of stuff
[31:15] and he had some ideas that some people
[31:19] may not embrace but he has said some
[31:22] things that have been transformational
[31:24] at times in my life this is one that
[31:28] could help us praise is the highest work
[31:32] carried out by God's children
[31:37] we know how important prayer is we know
[31:42] that prayer is not only our
[31:46] responsibility but it's our privilege
[31:48] but here is a man after God's heart
[31:51] who said I pray in the evening in the
[31:55] morning or at noon but seven times a day
[31:58] I praise the Lord
[32:02] seven times twice as many times I praise
[32:06] then I pray come on
[32:10] he must have knew that there's a key
[32:13] with our Thanksgiving with our gratitude
[32:16] with our praise there must be a key I
[32:20] had this thought that if we praised more
[32:24] we would create a better atmosphere in
[32:28] our life and we could pray more
[32:31] strategically more anointed targeted
[32:39] prophetic prayers are you in me how many
[32:44] of you like to pray prophetic prayers
[32:47] somebody said what is it prayers that
[32:49] agree with the heart of God prophetic
[32:53] prayer prayers that are ahead of their
[32:56] reality and fulfillment we pray now
[32:59] concerning what God is about to do and
[33:01] we can only do that in an atmosphere of
[33:04] the Spirit we can only do that in
[33:06] another realm and is it possible that if
[33:10] we praised more
[33:15] we could pray more effectively I don't
[33:19] want to say pray less because that means
[33:21] some folk wouldn't be praying at all
[33:25] but more effectively is there anybody in
[33:28] here they'd like to pray more effective
[33:30] prayers
[33:32] there are times to praise we better be
[33:35] praising more than we're fretting
[33:37] we better even be praising more than
[33:39] we're praying because it's not about
[33:42] asking huh it's about giving how many of
[33:48] you know when my enemies
[33:54] we're searching me down to destroy me I
[34:01] prayed for them he said I made my
[34:06] clothes sackcloth and ashes and I prayed
[34:11] for my enemies what a concept
[34:16] same psalmist and my prayers returned
[34:21] come on now oh when you're casting good
[34:27] bread on the water you can be assured
[34:32] that it'll return to you
[34:34] not many days hence David proved this in
[34:38] his lifestyle
[34:40] oh I prayed for the I was sick he said I
[34:45] was afflicted I was in bad shape but I
[34:50] prayed for my enemies sister Rhonda and
[34:52] when I prayed for them What did he say
[34:55] my prayers did what they return to my
[34:58] own bosom oh come on I prayed for them
[35:03] come on those who despitefully use you
[35:06] those who have abused you
[35:11] there's freedom
[35:14] there's freedom in being able to pray
[35:16] and listen Church you got to get out
[35:20] from under self-righteous prayer oh I
[35:25] prayed for some of my enemies I sure
[35:26] have
[35:31] Lord I'd like for you to mop up the
[35:33] floor we maybe not all of us I hate to
[35:38] say that we're brother
[35:39] Hicks saying my mama I don't want to say
[35:42] all of us have but some of us to be
[35:46] honest we've said Lord get him get him
[35:51] really Lord get them they need it but
[35:58] David wasn't praying get him he was
[36:02] freeing get him different attitude Oh
[36:05] God get their hearts change their lives
[36:10] your judgment is not going to bring them
[36:16] but your love your mercy hey your
[36:20] goodness chasing after them I've had
[36:25] people say to me when I was back slid
[36:28] when I was away from the Lord
[36:30] something good happened in my life I
[36:32] knew that the Lord had brought it I knew
[36:36] I didn't deserve it I knew it wasn't
[36:40] anything I deserved or ought to have but
[36:42] I knew that it wouldn't happen without
[36:43] the Lord helping me and it caused my
[36:46] heart to want to turn toward him instead
[36:52] of away from him how many of you
[36:55] understand so we asked you Lord
[37:00] get'em with conviction with mercy with
[37:07] love but we don't want to see them
[37:10] destroyed we want to see them ministered
[37:14] to are you still here I need to close in
[37:19] a little bit
[37:22] so David was praising twice as much as
[37:26] he was asking
[37:33] some of us treat God like Santa Claus we
[37:37] only sit on his lap when we need
[37:39] something
[37:43] how most of us here we don't teach our
[37:45] children anything like that we just feel
[37:49] pretty strong and if you tell your
[37:52] children over and over and over a lie
[37:55] when they face life and the enemy gets
[37:58] in their head and he will we don't want
[38:01] them to come around and think that as
[38:03] you have told them about the Tooth Fairy
[38:04] and the Easter Bunny and the Santa Claus
[38:07] you've also told them about Jesus and we
[38:10] don't want them to think that's a myth
[38:12] he's not a myth he's the only hope we
[38:14] have for eternal life and so we have to
[38:17] be careful what we tell our children
[38:19] amen
[38:23] we treat God that way we just warm up on
[38:26] his lap sometime because we need
[38:27] something and we know he already knows
[38:29] he already sees through us we don't ever
[38:33] have to feel guilty about approaching
[38:34] the Lord if we are walking in an
[38:37] attitude of praise and gratitude if you
[38:39] just go every day praising him lord I
[38:41] thank you lord I thank you I thank you
[38:45] for answered prayer I thank you for
[38:48] grace and mercy seven times a day do I
[38:50] praise thee because of thy righteous
[38:52] judgments lord thank you that America
[38:54] has not yet been destroyed thank you for
[38:59] for three plus years of reprieve in this
[39:03] country thank you for a for a bill
[39:07] against anti-semitism sign this week by
[39:12] our president thank you for that thank
[39:15] you Lord for the anniversary of the
[39:18] embassy moving from Tel Aviv to
[39:20] Jerusalem Lord thank you for that
[39:27] thank you for the last full moon of this
[39:30] decade
[39:32] on 1212 and its peak was 1212 so this
[39:41] last full moon of the decade came on
[39:46] December 12 and peaked at 12:12 number
[39:52] 12 is government government of God I'm
[39:59] not going to make something out of
[40:02] everything but if something becomes so
[40:06] obvious God's saying something you get
[40:10] up at 3 o'clock in the morning and you
[40:12] don't have to turn on the night light to
[40:14] go to the bathroom because the light is
[40:17] shut the moon is shining in so bright
[40:19] you can see everything on the counter I
[40:21] could see everything it was like the
[40:23] lights were on in my bedroom because our
[40:25] bedroom faces the moon and not at night
[40:27] I could see everything and you just
[40:31] can't help but remember what we heard a
[40:34] prophet say it's only when the Sun goes
[40:39] that the moon shines but the moon is a
[40:43] reflection of the sunlight and the moon
[40:47] is a type of the bride of Jesus Christ
[40:50] hallelujah and the real government of
[40:53] God is going to sit on the shoulders
[41:00] of those who carry Messiah on the throne
[41:05] of their life by giving him lordship and
[41:09] kingship full authority over everything
[41:14] that they are over everything that they
[41:16] have so these are glorious days come on
[41:20] now they're there in many ways terrible
[41:22] days oh yes but in many ways glorious
[41:25] days because God's doing his business
[41:27] God is faithful he's keeping up with his
[41:31] plan how many of you know he hadn't put
[41:33] anything on the back burner no siree
[41:36] everything God has promised it's always
[41:39] right before his eyes I'm nearly done
[41:41] this morning but it's right before his
[41:44] eyes he hasn't shoved anything to the
[41:47] backburner to forget it
[41:48] he can't see you without seeing your
[41:51] promise when he looks at you he sees
[41:54] your promise when he looks at you he
[41:57] sees your fullness come on he sees what
[42:01] the Blood has accomplished in your life
[42:05] all the way are you with me no under
[42:11] David when it came time to dedicate
[42:16] you're pointed Levites to play
[42:20] psalteries and harps
[42:24] to exalt the king to thank the Lord
[42:27] day and night hired musicians pitched a
[42:31] tent on Zion for the Ark of the Covenant
[42:36] changing the order of the day not hiding
[42:42] it behind the veil so the common man
[42:44] could never see the glory he was so glad
[42:48] to have the Ark of the Covenant back
[42:50] home in the city of Jerusalem the city
[42:53] of the Great King that he pitched a temp
[42:56] luck had never been pitched before that
[42:59] did not include a heavy veil of
[43:01] separation but it made an access for the
[43:06] people to stand off and see what was
[43:10] inside the tent and he lined the way
[43:16] with musicians and with singers who
[43:20] would just sing of the goodness of the
[43:22] Lord and the mercies of the Lord 24
[43:24] hours a day they are singing praises
[43:26] unto God and magnifying the Lord you
[43:29] know that must have changed the
[43:31] atmosphere in Jerusalem come on now
[43:33] you've got a dedicated people now he had
[43:36] to hire them to do it because they had
[43:39] to live I'm sure they couldn't have jobs
[43:41] and be on duty all the time so he hired
[43:43] them and he placed them in shifts and he
[43:46] made sure their needs were taken care of
[43:48] and and their responsibility was to be
[43:51] on the step to be on the right post to
[43:53] sing the praises of God to play
[43:55] instruments under the Lord and do it
[43:58] over and over and over and over again
[44:01] because David recognized that pray
[44:03] shifts the atmosphere praise makes a
[44:06] difference in what we are feeling and
[44:09] what we're experiencing come on now
[44:11] and Solomon carried that tradition on so
[44:15] that when the temple was dedicated to
[44:17] the Lord the same kind of glorious
[44:19] praise was going up from before the
[44:21] altar trumpets were sounding and cymbals
[44:24] were playing
[44:26] Solomon was not Church of Christ he
[44:30] believed it was all right to play
[44:32] instruments and to give every talent
[44:44] to the Lord
[44:48] to the praise of God you're gonna do it
[44:51] do all you got give it all you have if
[44:55] you're gonna do something for God hear
[44:57] me somebody if you're gonna do something
[44:59] for the Lord give him everything you've
[45:00] got everything give it all to him
[45:07] like granny standing behind me with the
[45:09] guitar and if I ever got too low I sing
[45:12] loud down I've had too many strikes on
[45:17] the back of my head
[45:19] because granny would be playing over
[45:21] here and I'd be standing there and if I
[45:24] if I went a little softer on the sound
[45:26] she just she just took the neck of the
[45:30] guitar hit me right
[45:36] I can tell you some of the songs I was
[45:38] singing at the time I was singing we've
[45:41] got the power but I was just singing it
[45:46] we've got the power yeah I looked at her
[45:53] she said if you're gonna sing about the
[45:54] power
[45:57] you gotta sing like somebody to know
[45:59] some power she was serious come on now I
[46:04] can show you I can show you there wasn't
[46:08] no strum plate what that's not what they
[46:09] call them what I'm sure of what now a
[46:13] pick guard now that sounds so much
[46:16] better than strum plate from guards from
[46:19] play it didn't do no good old granny
[46:23] always kept very nice Gibson's always
[46:26] had a little hick guard but but granny
[46:29] didn't strum like that you got a you
[46:31] know strum like this for that to do any
[46:33] good
[46:33] granny strum like this and so when she
[46:38] left this world all of her guitars had
[46:41] valleys in them cut right through the
[46:44] finish and ride into the wood because
[46:46] granny had this concept if you're giving
[46:49] it to God
[46:54] sing loud with your heart if you're
[47:00] dancing you ought to give God everything
[47:03] you have and don't you sit back you
[47:06] stuck in the mud you and make fun of
[47:09] somebody else
[47:14] I'll just say this a lot somebody else's
[47:18] praise is not your business it's just
[47:25] not your place to tell somebody else how
[47:29] they ought to praise the Lord if they
[47:32] become a distraction we know how to
[47:34] speak to that if they get way out of
[47:38] order we know how to speak to that but I
[47:40] want to tell you something sweetheart my
[47:42] praise is nunya
[47:47] it isn't and I'm not saying that to be
[47:50] offensive to you I'm saying that so you
[47:53] get your mouth off of somebody else's
[47:57] phrase I don't understand some things I
[48:01] see oh it is not a requirement for you
[48:06] to understand somebody else's phrase but
[48:11] it is a requirement for you to get your
[48:13] own you're gonna get your own phrase it
[48:20] may not look like somebody else's prize
[48:24] but you gotta have some there's got to
[48:29] be a praise that comes out of you
[48:32] because you're here but if you keep
[48:35] observing and studying and critiquing
[48:39] and criticizing somebody else's praise I
[48:46] believe in modesty I believe in holiness
[48:57] believe when you're in the aisle or in
[49:01] the front you need to be mindful of your
[49:07] attire when you're dancing or worshiping
[49:12] the Lord that's not being legalistic
[49:16] it's it's right I've been on the
[49:20] conference circuit I've had to stand on
[49:23] the front row while women stood in front
[49:26] of their husbands to keep them from
[49:29] having to look at the Jezebel's that
[49:35] were dancing seductively around their
[49:38] husbands now that ain't God no woman
[49:42] ought to have to give up her praise to
[49:44] stand between that spirit and her
[49:46] husband come on now and I've seen that I
[49:50] don't believe in that I believe there's
[49:52] an order and I believe there's modesty
[49:54] and if you're gonna worship here please
[49:56] know that but but that is not something
[50:00] that anybody needs to get so hung up in
[50:04] that that you feel like that you're
[50:08] called to be the praise police
[50:16] you
[50:18] just praise you get your eyes on Jesus
[50:22] come on now get him off of somebody else
[50:26] listen I've told you about the tenth
[50:28] meeting in South Carolina where God
[50:30] healed those people the woman pushing
[50:33] the wheelchair you seen the picture of
[50:34] and God healed a man and a woman of AIDS
[50:37] and the stories are out there this black
[50:41] brother Caleb in the oniy who came here
[50:43] to preach he had just come from one of
[50:45] the pastors that was there and he had
[50:47] told him the testimony of how God had
[50:49] healed two of those from one family of
[50:51] AIDS in that meeting and when the
[50:53] presence of God came down and did what
[50:55] he did most people will worship in the
[50:57] Lord now I want to tell you something
[50:58] some of those family members had to come
[51:00] in they was barely dressed
[51:02] it was hot summertime in South Carolina
[51:06] muggy and mosquitoes there was a few
[51:10] times that it looked like there was more
[51:12] hanging out than there was tucked in do
[51:17] you know what I mean
[51:19] and my first reaction would have been
[51:23] somebody ought to help you know somebody
[51:25] ought to wrap them up somebody ought to
[51:27] do son who's gonna do it and all of a
[51:32] sudden I thought as I scanned the crowd
[51:38] and I saw all those revelaed people
[51:40] who'd been in the word for 25-30 years
[51:45] dead couldn't even praise the Lord
[51:50] that someone was testifying of being
[51:52] healed of AIDS when they were telling
[51:55] all over the country that there's no
[51:57] documented cases at that time they were
[51:59] telling all over the country no
[52:00] documented cases of everybody anybody
[52:02] ever coming back from AIDS totally
[52:04] healed and these believers sitting there
[52:08] praise the Lord praise the Lord
[52:13] and the ones who weren't doing that
[52:15] we're evaluating and I realize I got
[52:17] first of all I gotta stop looking
[52:19] because I'm seeing more than I need to
[52:22] see and second of all this is my house
[52:26] this ain't my tent I didn't put this
[52:28] somebody else is conducting this meeting
[52:30] I need to get my eyes off of that get my
[52:34] eyes on the Lord get my own praise on
[52:36] and you know what God knew what he was
[52:41] doing he sent his glory on that family
[52:43] and save them fill them with the Holy
[52:47] Ghost set members of that family free
[52:49] and they now that church is filled with
[52:53] second and third generation brother
[52:56] Kaylin I only know some of them 2nd and
[52:58] 3rd generation from that very family
[53:02] that got so touched they didn't know no
[53:05] better all they knew is God had just
[53:07] given their loved one back all they knew
[53:10] is that there was an atmosphere in there
[53:12] that you could feel and they couldn't be
[53:15] still my old gray-headed aunt used to
[53:19] sing a song that said I can't be still
[53:22] my heart would chill since I have found
[53:26] the Holy Ghost and it changed my
[53:29] stubborn will I can't be still I know
[53:35] what he's done for me and I've just got
[53:40] to give him praise I'm encouraging you
[53:44] to get your praise on it's not for show
[53:50] it's not to draw somebody else's
[53:53] attention but if enough good the Holy
[53:55] Ghost sincere people will do like you
[53:59] did today create an atmosphere nobody
[54:03] will have time to look around to see
[54:06] what anybody else is doing I've been in
[54:08] churches who claim to believe the word
[54:10] that have deacons go and tap people on
[54:13] the shoulder if they overhear someone
[54:17] speaking in a little bit of tongues as
[54:19] praise or intercession they stop them
[54:23] because they felt like that if their if
[54:25] that got too loud
[54:26] it was going to require an
[54:28] interpretation for it to be an order I
[54:32] want to tell you something that's
[54:33] chilling to see someone stop somebody
[54:41] that's chillin you better know that
[54:44] you're right and you better know you got
[54:48] the whole Bible backing you up and not a
[54:50] quote when you stop somebody like that
[54:55] because I want you to know there is a
[54:58] place we get in him we can't help
[54:59] ourselves hmm
[55:02] that next morning 1975 that next morning
[55:13] after
[55:16] being in the spirit all night long
[55:19] waking up all hours of the night
[55:24] speaking in tongues my backslidden
[55:27] granddaddy laid in the bed next to me
[55:29] over there on a twin bed two twin beds
[55:32] because he told my granny that night I
[55:35] better stay in there with Steve because
[55:37] I just never seen a case like this
[55:42] I woke up all hours of the night Vicki
[55:44] in tongues when I finally woke up the
[55:45] next morning they called me to breakfast
[55:48] I mean breakfast honey not cereal
[55:52] breakfast table steaming with breakfast
[55:57] and they went to ask me do you want milk
[55:59] or orange juice and I went to say orange
[56:02] juice I think and it was in another
[56:04] language
[56:09] and it was a long time that would happen
[56:13] to me at the most inconvenient moments
[56:15] when someone would ask a question and I
[56:17] would not think of my mom answer and go
[56:19] to say it and it would come out
[56:20] something else
[56:21] my granddaddy I can see him right now he
[56:23] put his hand on the table and he said
[56:26] I've never seen nothing like this but
[56:29] I'd be afraid to come against it
[56:31] that was his attitude
[56:35] that ought to be our attitude now I want
[56:40] to give you this verse in clothes oh my
[56:43] don't want to but it's late I know that
[56:46] give you one verse here Psalm 51 more
[56:50] solemn and we're doing 50 and verse 23

[57:02] to him that order if his conversational
[57:05] right will I show the salvation of God
[57:12] your words matter your conversation

[57:19] Hebrew year of the pay which is the
[57:23] mouth we have emphasis on what comes out
[57:28] of our mouth in this season and let us
[57:32] say from now on until rapture we're
[57:36] watching our conversation
[57:38] we must we've got to watch our words
[57:42] pray like he prayed put a watch over my
[57:46] heart a stay on my lips a seal on my
[57:51] lips that I may not sin against thee
[57:55] because you can get the hair right and
[57:58] the dress right and where to go and
[58:00] where not to go right and this thing
[58:03] right here come on how do you know
[58:07] because I know how it has been used in
[58:10] my life
[58:15] the psalmist said whoso offereth praise
[58:20] glorifies me
[58:24] the nature and get this please the
[58:28] nature of praise is an offering it is an
[58:36] offering
[58:40] this is not my idea this is the Bible
[58:44] concept whoso offereth praise
[58:51] that word offering is a Hebrew words of
[58:56] och
[58:58] it means a slaughter or excuse me
[59:03] a slaughter for sacrifice
[59:07] I'm not making that up it come right out
[59:10] of the lexicon Hebrew word 20 776
[59:14] Strong's Concordance
[59:16] slaughter for sacrifice whoso slaughter
[59:20] a--the for sacrifice praise
[59:25] glorifies me got it
[59:30] you're praised according to this verse
[59:33] is a slaughtered sacrifice
[59:40] it is as though you have cut the throat
[59:43] of a lamb
[59:46] not just any lamb
[59:49] the best lamb you had to offer
[59:53] are you with me you give me five minutes
[59:55] of grace here Abel you've heard the
[1:00:01] Prophet tale
[1:00:05] with a jagged rock with a grapevine
[1:00:08] around his neck let his little lamb -
[1:00:12] the author Cain comes with a basket of
[1:00:17] turnips
[1:00:21] vegetables out of the garden the fruit
[1:00:25] of his hand Abel brings another offering
[1:00:30] he brings a lamb not just any lamb hear
[1:00:33] me his favorite lamb his pet lamb Abel
[1:00:40] raised this lamb loved this lamb but it
[1:00:46] was time to give God praise an altruist
[1:00:49] being built come on there was no Bible
[1:00:53] to read all they knew was the story that
[1:00:57] Adam her father had told them about how
[1:01:00] God Himself came down right in the Bible
[1:01:04] I served God all those years and never
[1:01:09] even knew that was in the Bible God came
[1:01:14] down and took animal skins and made Adam
[1:01:19] and Eve clothes to cover their nakedness
[1:01:23] he's right there in the book
[1:01:29] they knew this but King heard it but he
[1:01:35] didn't get it but Abel got a revelation
[1:01:38] when the altar was built and it was time
[1:01:40] to give God praise Cain brought brought
[1:01:43] his fruit turnips but Abel brought his a
[1:01:46] lamb grapevine around his neck dragging
[1:01:49] him over to the altar he sits down lays
[1:01:51] that little lamb in his lap picks up a
[1:01:56] jagged stone and starts hacking away at
[1:01:58] the jugular vein of that little lamb
[1:02:01] until it's blood you know what happens
[1:02:05] his blood is spurting with every beat of
[1:02:09] its heart and those heartbeats are
[1:02:13] getting slower and they're doing less
[1:02:15] but the blood continues to flow out of
[1:02:19] that vein until that little white lamb
[1:02:21] was bathed in red blood and guess what
[1:02:25] children
[1:02:29] so is Abel
[1:02:33] so was able able himself covered in the
[1:02:40] blood of his little offering
[1:02:43] don't you know God was pointing
[1:02:49] to Calvary come on when that when the
[1:02:54] purpose of that blood was not to drain
[1:02:58] into the ground it was to provide a way
[1:03:01] that the life of that blood could fall
[1:03:05] all over you so that when God looked
[1:03:10] down and saw Abel he saw him covered in
[1:03:15] the blood of his offering I need you to
[1:03:19] know an offering of praise will cost you
[1:03:23] something because it won't be based
[1:03:26] always on abundance it'll be based on
[1:03:32] love he loved that lamb but he loved God
[1:03:38] more Abraham loved Isaac but he loved
[1:03:45] God more he was willing to lay as Isaac
[1:03:52] on the altar to kill his promise because
[1:03:59] he loved God more and I want you to see
[1:04:02] this Cain is standing over there maybe
[1:04:06] kneeling over there by an altar and he's
[1:04:09] still trying to figure out what he
[1:04:11] missed
[1:04:13] because God came and was pleased with
[1:04:16] Abel's offering but the offering of Cain
[1:04:19] caused God to be Roth it stirred the
[1:04:22] wrath of God in his heart because King
[1:04:25] found out that day you can't get blood
[1:04:29] out of a turnip God was looking for
[1:04:32] blood not that he is bloodthirsty but he
[1:04:36] has a plan
[1:04:37] he had already created blood that would
[1:04:40] bring redemption to mankind come on now
[1:04:43] that was his offering an offering is
[1:04:45] going to cost you something whoso
[1:04:47] offereth praise
[1:04:50] and I will tell you one more time that's
[1:04:53] not a word that means reaching a
[1:04:55] pocketful of coins
[1:04:58] and take out a couple and give them to
[1:05:01] God
[1:05:02] that's not the word here the word is
[1:05:07] slaughter for sacrifice
[1:05:13] that's what your praise is because
[1:05:17] you're not praising him every time out
[1:05:21] of abundance or because everything's
[1:05:24] going good or because you feel like you
[1:05:26] always hears your prayer you're gonna
[1:05:29] have to be like David
[1:05:33] you ever read their other half of the
[1:05:35] deep calls to the deep at the noise of
[1:05:38] that waterspouts
[1:05:39] you ever read the rest of that phrase
[1:05:43] that's not the goodness of God that was
[1:05:47] washing over David
[1:05:50] that was the stress and pressure and
[1:05:53] heartache and persecutions of life all
[1:05:58] this stuff has washed over me
[1:06:02] until I have almost lost my my place but
[1:06:06] I'm going to give God what's his this is
[1:06:08] Davis at heart I'm gonna give him what's
[1:06:10] his I'm gonna praise him if he washes me
[1:06:13] down this mountain because there's a
[1:06:15] deep in here there's something in there
[1:06:18] that responds to God and it doesn't
[1:06:20] respond based on feeling lest and not on
[1:06:24] feeling none of what I have none of what
[1:06:28] I don't have it responds based on God's
[1:06:32] faithfulness I want to ask you
[1:06:35] has he been faithful in your life I'm
[1:06:40] not going to ask you if you've always
[1:06:43] been faithful to him because I I know
[1:06:46] the answer to that your answer is like
[1:06:49] mine no I've not always been faithful to
[1:06:53] him but I can say with sister Jaya that
[1:06:57] he has always been faithful to me and he
[1:07:03] deserves my praise
