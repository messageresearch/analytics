I [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and you're watching the Eagles cry thank you so much for tuning into the broadcast today we're in a series on exercising the senses of our spirit

well we have prayer warriors intercessors as part of this ministry who will take these prayer requests before the throne of God join our faith with your faith and believe that the Lord will will do the miraculous because he's a miracle-working God and he's able to do exceedingly and abundantly above that which we even ask or think so all of the contact information will be given to you on the screen and we just invite you to reach out make some contact with our staff and let us know where you're watching this program we appreciate every email all the contact that comes in I want us to get right into the study because last week I almost I ran right out of time I introduced the story i was going to share with you and then ran out of time so we need to get right back into our study today okay in Genesis chapter 2 verses 19 and 20 we we read about this place of harmony with God first of all Adam walked in perfect oneness harmony with God made in the image and in the likeness of God communicated with God spirit to spirit because of that because of that oneness that place that he had with God in his spirit man it also caused him to function in harmony with all of God's creation because Adam was action given Dominion and you know I think we could look at that before we before we go to chapter 2 here let's look at Genesis and perhaps we could get that Scripture and just remind you of what the Lord had said part of that part of that Commission was that Adam have dominion over everything he was made in the in the image and likeness of God Genesis 126 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let us or let them have dominion over the fish of the sea the fowl of the air over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God gave as the original mandate to Adam and Eve Dominion of course we're speaking of Adam now but we know that Eve came out of Adam gave them dominion over all of nature all of the other creations and it's an interesting thing because they flowed and operated in such harmony and that that brings us to Genesis chapter 2 where we wanted to share again today it says verse 19 and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them a member remember again God brought the animals to Adam and said hey Adam what would you name this animal it's an interesting thing and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the night that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle to the fowl of the air to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found a helpmeet for him so what we were teaching was that we believe this harmony that Adam had with with God's other creations his other creatures it's not just for Adam we believe that the curse is being reversed we believe that God is calling you and I to walk in that kind of place of Dominion in the kingdom of God there may be circumstances as we minister for him that we need to exercise that authority and that Dominion even over stormy winds we see that happening over weather patterns or perhaps even over these other creatures the animal kingdom that God has made I read to you last time we were together two beautiful examples of how God gave brother Branham this this love that projected first to the Hornets and instead of them they were already covering his body but instead of them stinging him when he just started ministering to them out of love and I'm sorry I disturbed you and just go right back to where you came from and I'm sorry I disturbed your nap or whatever the words were and all of a sudden they make that that line line right up and went right back into that bird box where they had made their nest and then he told us about the bull and I read that to you where he he crossed into a field where there was a bull that had killed a man just three months before he was so afraid when he saw that bull coming but all of a sudden the perfect love of God just come flooding over his spirit man and he projected that love and when love is projected grace takes over and and so there are many situations in our life now now we're talking about the animal kingdom but you know you can absolutely defuse a situation with someone on the street with a with a conflict or some kind of relationship that's gone awry or perhaps a traffic situation or or a co-worker where there is a lot of animosity and a lot of ill-feeling that's being stirred up you would be surprised how love projected can diffuse can can absolutely speak peace into a storm or into a stormy situation and so I told you right at the end of the broadcast that I would share with you a testimony from the life of sadhu sundar Singh and he was about 15 years old when he was converted to Christianity in 1904 I think was his the uris of his conversion in 1905 he was baptized into the church of england he disappeared in 1929 and no one ever found his body he was doing a strenuous work in Tibet but there's a testimony of how he lived in harmony with other parts of God's creation and I'm going to read this testimony from a man who hosted sadhu sundar Singh in his home many many years ago those who roomed our lived with him speaking of sadhu sundar Singh not only saw but recorded some of the marvelous events which seemed to constantly take place around his life and I believe that's because he was walking as a forerunner in this place of divine alignment communicating with God spirit to spirit bringing the soul into its rightful place its proper order and balance feeding the spirit man until it becomes the force that governs us the Holy Spirit sitting the Lord Jesus sitting on the throne of our human spirit he said that's a gentleman who later became a YMCA secretary in England wrote of a night which had left him stunned and speechless long after midnight the man said I was roused by movement in the room the sadhu had risen from his bed and was moving toward the door which opened onto the wooden stairs outside the house the creaking of the wood made it clear that he was going down the stairs knowing that the sad who spent hours of the night in prayer I was not surprised at this but when half an hour or so it passed and he had not returned I became uneasy the thought of that leopard that lived in the valley made me feel anxious so I got out of bed and looked out the window toward the forest a few yards from the house I saw the sad news sitting looking down into the deep valley it was a beautiful night the stars were shining quietly for a few moments I watched the silent figure of the sadhu then my eyes were attracted by something moving on his right an animal was coming toward him as I got nervous I saw that it was a leopard choked with fear I stood motionless near the window unable even to call out to him just then the sadhu turned his face towards the animal and held out his hand as though it had been a dog the leopard lay down and stretched out its head to be stroked by the satu it was a strange and unbelievable scene and I can never forget it a short time afterwards the sadhu returned and was soon asleep but I lay awake wondering at what I had seen the foregoing deliverance brings to mind the more famous incident when a man eating wolf was rebuked and tamed by sant francis of assisi incredible as it might seem people who walk close to Jesus Christ have exercised this strange power both over bloodthirsty bandits and cruel beast of prey perhaps we'll just share a little bit of the story of st. Francis in the wolf just kind of go right into that perhaps the most famous story of Saint Francis is when he tamed the wolf that was terrorizing the people of a certain village in the village was spelled GU BBI o gubbio while Francis was staying in that town he learned of a wolf that was so ravenous that it was not only killing and eating animals but also eating people to the people took up arms and went after it but those who encountered the wolf perished as at its sharp teeth villagers became afraid to leave the city walls Francis had pity on the people and decided to go out and meet the wolf he was desperately worn by the people but he insisted that God would take care of him a brave fryer in several peasants accompanied Francis outside the city gate but soon the peasants lost heart and said they would not go any farther Francis and his companion began to walk on suddenly the wolf's jaws a gap charged out of the woods at the couple Francis made the sign of the Cross toward it that was his faith that was his religion the power of God caused the wolf to slow down and to close its mouth then Francis called out to the creature come to me brother wolf in the name of Christ i order you not to hurt anyone at that moment the wolf lowered its head and laid down at the feet of st. Francis meek as a lamb st. Francis explained that the wolf that he that had been terrorizing the people killing not only animals but humans were also made in the image of God killing humans who were made in the image of God Brother Wolf said Francis i want to make peace between you and the people of this village they will harm you no more and you must no longer harm them all past crimes are to be forgiven the wolf showed his ascent by moving its body and nodding its head then to the absolute surprise of the gathering crowd Francis asked the wolf to make a pledge as st. Francis extended his hand to receive the pledge so the wolf extended his front paw and placed it in the hand of the same then Francis commanded the wolf to follow him into the town to make a peace pact with the townspeople the wolf meekly followed Saint Francis by the time they got to the town square everyone was there to witness the miracle with the wolf at his side Francis gave the town of sermon on the wonderful and fearful love of God the power of the love of God when it is displayed when it is projected even toward the animal kingdom calling them to repent for their sin then he offered the townspeople peace on behalf of the wolf the townspeople promised in a loud voice to feed the wolf then Francis asked the wolf if he would live in peace under those terms he bowed his head twisted his body in a way that convinced everyone he accepted the pack then once again the wolf placed his paw in Francis hand as a sign from that day on the people kept the pack they had made the wolf lived for two years among the townspeople going from door to door for food it hurt no one and no one heard yet even the dogs did not bark at it when the wolf finally died of old age the people of the village were sad the wolf's peaceful ways had been a living reminder to them of the wonders patience and virtues of this man of God it had been a living symbol of the power and Providence of God now why would you share such a story is that well I believe I've given you four examples of thousands and thousands of testimonies that could be shared from all the nations of the world that there are times when man has needed to exercise authority over this over the animal kingdom and I believe these are tokens and reminders of a walk that is available to people of God today we read about the mystics who lived in the woods who fasted and prayed in cabins who who came in why was that why is that a part of of church history I believe it's because there were four runners who found a way to tap in to this relationship with God I do not believe that God is calling us all to the woods or that he's calling us all to live in cabins apart from all other people or that he's calling us all to live communally but I do believe that he is calling his his group of overcomers the bride that we have talked about to a place of spirit to spirit communication with him so that we are so transformed from the inside out that we come into such harmony and cooperation with heaven that it brings us into harmony in that other realm that we've been chosen to function in the earthly realm we started introducing this series by saying man has been divinely created to function in two realms the earthly realm and the heavenly realm I believe this place of cooperation where God is calling us to come into a place that we be sensitive that we are sensitive to what's going on in heavenly places well how can we do that well we've been all to sit together in fellowship in heavenly places as we worship the Lord I really believe that there is a lot of activity that that's going on in the realm of the Holy Spirit in that spiritual dimension I believe in angels I don't worship angels I don't believe that we should let our focus be on angels but I do believe that angels are released to minister to strengthen to bring healing to bring words of encouragement words of instruction there even at times meant to warn of judgment we go through the scripture i think i've done a teaching with you here on the Eagles cry concerning some of the different ministries of angels that are outlined in the scripture and I believe that there's a lot of things going on around the throne of the Living God that if we could begin to tap into that if we could begin to discern when angels have come into our home or when when heavenly messengers have come into our services if we could discern that then perhaps we could humble ourselves lay aside our agendas come into a place of cooperation with the realm of the Spirit then I believe there would be impartation like we've never known I believe there would be power and authority released among the believers that we've only read about in times gone by in a few token examples even in the great healing revival in America spread around the world in the late 40s and and through the 50s it seemed yet even in that time to be through token vessels through examples but I believe we're about to enter into a spiritual era a spiritual season a Kairos moment and and what that means is a time of heightened spiritual activity we're there brother we're there we're living in a season of heightened spiritual activity and in times past we've not been able to get enough accomplished when revival would fall when a stirring would come to our churches when we see a real wind of the Spirit of God blowing we've not been able to get enough accomplished before the thing started lifting before man started trying to organize and kind of when that happens the Spirit of God starts with drawing and we see revivals dwindling away but I believe that there's coming a season to the body of Christ that's not going to dwindle that's not going to die out I believe there's a bride's revival on the horizon where a group of people are going to qualify they're going to be called up into a place where we will walk in such harmony in such cooperation with heavens agenda with the with the agenda of the Living God how will we do that we'll do that by having communication with God spirit the spirit did you do you understand what I'm saying when I tell you we were made to function in both the earthly realm and the heavenly realm the problem is we have lost our ability to function in the heavenly realm and God is restoring that it was potentially restored by the new birth the door was opened the way was made it is now possible for us to function dually in the earthly realm and in the heavenly realm but as we've been teaching over the past few weeks this grace this ability this gifting that we've been created with originally to function in the heavenly realm it was lost in the fall of Adam it was made available again by the death of the second Adam the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ but in this hour it is a process now it is a development it is it is an exercise where the more we learn to lay our agenda just just some natural instruction now late start practicing laying your agenda down you can do that in prayer think of the things that you want to get accomplished and you start saying lord I submit that to you I lay that on the altar I want the fire of God to come and burn up my my thoughts even they seem Noble even if they seem like good thoughts if they're not God's thoughts they'll only hinder us from coming into that place of spirit to spirit communication and we want that you may have a good idea of going in winning the lost in such as such a nation but if that's not God's thoughts concerning you then by going and doing that you'll not bring yourself into a closer place of intimacy you in fact instead of a line in yourself you'll be disel ining yourself you'll be bringing dysfunction into your relationship the only way that we can walk in full functionality with the Spirit of God is to come into agreement with heavens agenda with God's ideas with the thoughts of God how does that happen by renewing our mind by allowing the Word of God and the Spirit of God to bring us into that new way of thinking that new way of leadership there is a leadership that God wants to bring forth in our life where he leads from the throne of our human spirit where he gives the the command where he gives the the leadership like the prophet of the of the Old Testament said to hear a word behind me saying this is the way waukee in it I really believe that the majority of those who call themselves believers are hungry for heavenly leadership for divine guidance we've tried it our way and it hasn't seemed to work and so now we're looking for God's Way you see Adam was placed in the garden and the Garden of Eden was sort of like a probationary environment he was really placed in a situation where he would be tested he would be tempted he would be tried and God knew that I want you to know that that did not escape the mind of God he knew exactly what was going to happen in Genesis chapter 2 verses 16 and 17 and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden you may freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge good and evil you shall not eat of it for in the day that you eat thereof you shall surely die see it was a probationary environment God made Adam dependent on himself it was the plan of God that man recognized acknowledged and even celebrate his dependency on his creator and when I say celebrate I mean we should rejoice in the fact that that we cannot accomplish anything outside of the grace of God because if we accomplished something in the grace of God we know we've done God's will so it's really something to celebrate Adam could not learn to walk in the dependency until he had the opportunity to become independent that's why we are where we are right now Adam could not learn to function in that place of dependency long-term until he had the opportunity to live without it to live independent of his creator and that that is why we read about what happened in the Garden of Eden it was a probationary period it was a probationary environment God wanted Adam to be allowed if it was his choice to see what it would mean to be independent and in so doing he really lost that oneness from that moment on Eve took of the fruit she gave it to Adam she believed the lie of the of we could say of the serpent but the live did not originate with a serpent the lie originated with the devil the devil was using the serpent as a vessel that he could speak through but Eve believed the devil's lie and if you'll notice that even the lie was a great portion of truth with just a little discrepancy mixed in with the truth but it was a lie it was enough of a lie to bring her out of fellowship when Adam saw what she had done he took on her see he partook of what she had partaken of and therefore he faced God he faced God and it's a beautiful beautiful type of what our Lord Jesus Christ did now by walking in dependency his spirit could continue to have communion with the Lord but because of the fall he became independent he was driven out of the garden look look at Genesis 38 the beginning of it said and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day when Adam for took of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil the part of adam this is very very important for where we're going in the study when Adam disobeyed when Adam took from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil he lost that part of himself which was spirit he lost a part if not all of his spirit life he began to function flesh and soul and the spirit life part of Adam ceased to function and what happened was that cut off his communion with God severed his communion with God Genesis 38 the second part of the verse said and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God see what happened the first part of that they had enjoyed their fellowship with God their communion with God now this spirit part of adam has died and he is hiding himself from the very thing that he wants loved so much friend that's why Jesus had to come because that fellowship that was lost between Adam and God had to be restored that fellowship had to be restored and I believe that it has been restored through the coming of the sacrificial lamb the Lord Jesus Christ but I believe that the body of Christ is not yet functioning in that place of communion that Adam walked in and that's why we want to learn more about it so that we can exercise the senses of our spirit man and we can come into that place of divine alignment and walk and commune with God in a way that Adam did in a way that the Lord Jesus did I'm looking for that I believe we're I believe we're moving into that cycle and into that season I want to pray for you right now father I just ask that you would take these words and that you would let them live in the hearts of those who have listened so carefully father I pray that you would not let them just be a lesson but that you would let them become a revelation by the power of the Holy Spirit I call for the awakening right now of the spirit of man those who are tuned in connected to what has been shared in these last few sessions together and I just call for the spirit man to awaken to rise up and to begin to receive the word of the Lord to bring each person into that place of divine alignment where the Spirit is connected with your spirit Oh hallelujah where we come into that place and out of that Lord we get the authority the end the Dominion that you gave to Adam even over the earthly environment even over the animal kingdom Lord father they're missionaries on the field right now who faced some of these same kinds of dangers of vicious animals and terrible weather patterns and lord I just pray that that you will raise up a company of people who recognized by the Spirit who they are and start living and functioning in the fullness of our place of communion and union with you hallelujah oh thank you Jesus Lord we just ask these things in your lovely name the name of Yeshua the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen I pray that something is being imparted into your life right now that you're going to begin a spiritual Trek a spiritual journey like you've never been on before dig dig dig until God awakened something in you and you begin to step into the fullness of your destiny thank you for watching the Eagles cry we're going to continue some of these teachings the next time we're together so come on back okay god bless you bye bye for now [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you
