Description:
The glory doesn’t fall on the living.

It comes to those who’ve laid it all down—those who’ve died to self at the altar and made room for the King of Glory.

In this message, we’re reminded that the altar isn’t where we go to be seen… it’s where we go to die. And only dead men can see the glory of the Lord.

John didn’t see the glorified Christ until he fell at His feet as one dead. We can’t carry pride, comfort, or performance into the holy place. It’s death to self, and then the fire falls.

If you’re hungry for more than a feeling… if you’re desperate for transformation… you’ll find Him where the sacrifice lies still, and the flame descends.

Lord, make us ready.
Make us dead men walking.
And let Your glory fall.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Only dead men can see the glory of the Lord. Is there anybody in here that wants to see the glory? I want to see it today and I want to see it again tomorrow. We are seeing we are experiencing visitations of of measures of his glory. Every time we come together, seated together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, the glory of God is present. But we're looking for a full manifestation of cavode shakana shakina glory. And in that shakina glory, you get more than a feeling. You get more than a little jabber of tongues or some little something sensation or a goosebump or your hair is standing up. No. In the presence of the manifested glory of God, you're changed. And you may have been saved 35, 40 years, but I'm telling you, there are still things in our lives tonight that we need change to come. Lord, I believe you've got levels and measures of change coming for us like we have only scratched the surface of dead men walking. The only way to see the glory of God is as a dead man. Amen. Oh yes. The only way to encounter the fullness of the glory of God is to do it as a dead man. Now, I'm not talking about the undertaker and the funeral home and the casket. That's not the kind of dead I'm talking about. I'm talking about an entirely different kind of dead. The altar is not the bless me club. The altar is where we go to die. It's not where we go to live, it's where we go to die. Pretty serious business, isn't it? We avoid repentance because we don't care for how death smells. It was only after John became a dead man walking abandoned on deserted island of Patmas that he heard a voice and turned right toward the face of God, Jesus Christ. in in Revelation 1:17, "And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead, and he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, fear not, I am the first and the last." It wasn't until he fell like a dead man that he could look right square into the face of the Lord Jesus Christ in his glorified body, glorified existence. That's pretty powerful, isn't it? He was a chosen apostle of the Lord. He'd spent most of his ministry leaning his head on the chest of the Lord. He had seen the miraculous. He had seen the glory. He had tasted the cup right from the Lord's hands. He had experienced what it feels like to have your feet washed by Jesus. But he hadn't died yet. Oh, they tried to kill him. They boiled him in oil and and banished him to the aisle of Patmas, but he hadn't died yet. But when he realized this is it, it's time for some things to go. He got in the spirit on the Lord's day. He was caught up to see the day and hour that you and I are living in. And he fell as a dead man. When he began to hear this voice, he turned to see the voice. And there stood the Lord in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, which represent the seven churches of Asia Minor and the seven church ages of all of church history. It's a pretty powerful revelation. But he couldn't get it on his feet. He couldn't get it in a dance. He couldn't get in in a hotty spirit. He had to be like a dead man. He had to fall and humble himself. I tell you, some of us need some carpet time. Maybe we understand some mysteries, but we need some We need some Jesus time. We need some time in the presence of the Lord. We need the atmosphere that that that welcomes the glory. The glory of God doesn't just come down in and on anything. It comes down in an atmosphere that has been carefully prepared to receive the presence of the King of glory. You can be preaching the right thing and the glory won't come. You can be singing the right song and the glory won't come. But without the fullness of the glory of God, we're just going through the motions. We need the fire of God. And fire doesn't fall on empty altars. There has to be a sacrifice laying up there. Dead to self, but a living sacrifice as unto the Lord. When that fire began to fall in the first great awakening, John Wesley gave this testimony. They said to him, "How are you getting such big crowds to come and hear you preach?" He said, "Oh, that's easy. I set myself on fire and the people come to watch me burn." He didn't mean with matches. He didn't mean with a campfire. He meant I consecrate. I dedicate my life unto the Lord so that the glory of God will fall on the altar. Not a feeling, not an emotional, not some physical manifestation, a transforming change that you walk out of it fully identified with Christ, the word and you know who you are. You don't have to keep doubting it.
