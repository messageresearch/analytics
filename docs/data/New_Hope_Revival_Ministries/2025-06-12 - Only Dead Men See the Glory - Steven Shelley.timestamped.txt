[0:00] Only dead men can see the glory of the
[0:03] Lord. Is there anybody in here that
[0:05] wants to see the glory? I want to see it
[0:08] today and I want to see it again
[0:09] tomorrow.
[0:11] We are seeing we are experiencing
[0:14] visitations of of measures of his glory.
[0:18] Every time we come together, seated
[0:20] together in heavenly places in Christ
[0:22] Jesus, the glory of God is present. But
[0:26] we're looking for a full manifestation
[0:28] of cavode
[0:31] shakana
[0:32] shakina glory. And in that shakina
[0:36] glory, you get more than a feeling. You
[0:39] get more than a little jabber of tongues
[0:41] or some little something sensation or a
[0:44] goosebump or your hair is standing up.
[0:46] No. In the presence of the manifested
[0:48] glory of God, you're changed.
[0:53] And you may have been saved 35, 40
[0:55] years, but I'm telling you, there are
[0:57] still things in our lives tonight that
[1:00] we need change to come.
[1:03] Lord, I believe you've got levels and
[1:06] measures of change coming for us like we
[1:10] have only scratched the surface of dead
[1:13] men walking.
[1:16] The only way to see the glory of God is
[1:20] as a dead man. Amen.
[1:23] Oh yes. The only way to encounter the
[1:25] fullness of the glory of God is to do it
[1:27] as a dead man. Now, I'm not talking
[1:29] about the undertaker and the funeral
[1:32] home and the casket. That's not the kind
[1:36] of dead I'm talking about. I'm talking
[1:38] about an entirely different kind of
[1:40] dead.
[1:42] The altar is not the bless me club. The
[1:45] altar is where we go to die.
[1:50] It's not where we go to live, it's where
[1:52] we go to die. Pretty serious business,
[1:55] isn't it? We avoid repentance because we
[1:58] don't care for how death smells.
[2:02] It was only after John became a dead man
[2:04] walking abandoned on deserted island of
[2:07] Patmas that he heard a voice and turned
[2:09] right toward the face of God, Jesus
[2:11] Christ. in in Revelation 1:17, "And when
[2:14] I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead,
[2:16] and he laid his right hand upon me,
[2:17] saying unto me, fear not, I am the first
[2:19] and the last." It wasn't until he fell
[2:21] like a dead man that he could look right
[2:23] square into the face of the Lord Jesus
[2:26] Christ in his glorified body, glorified
[2:29] existence. That's pretty powerful, isn't
[2:31] it? He was a chosen apostle of the Lord.
[2:33] He'd spent most of his ministry leaning
[2:35] his head on the chest of the Lord. He
[2:38] had seen the miraculous. He had seen the
[2:40] glory. He had tasted the cup right from
[2:43] the Lord's hands. He had experienced
[2:45] what it feels like to have your feet
[2:47] washed by Jesus.
[2:49] But he hadn't died yet. Oh, they tried
[2:51] to kill him. They boiled him in oil and
[2:53] and banished him to the aisle of Patmas,
[2:55] but he hadn't died yet. But when he
[2:58] realized this is it, it's time for some
[3:01] things to go.
[3:04] He got in the spirit on the Lord's day.
[3:06] He was caught up to see the day and hour
[3:08] that you and I are living in. And he
[3:11] fell as a dead man. When he began to
[3:15] hear this voice, he turned to see the
[3:17] voice. And there stood the Lord in the
[3:19] midst of the seven golden candlesticks,
[3:21] which represent the seven churches of
[3:23] Asia Minor and the seven church ages of
[3:26] all of church history. It's a pretty
[3:28] powerful revelation. But he couldn't get
[3:30] it on his feet.
[3:32] He couldn't get it in a dance. He
[3:34] couldn't get in in a hotty spirit. He
[3:37] had to be like a dead man. He had to
[3:39] fall and humble himself. I tell you,
[3:41] some of us need some carpet time. Maybe
[3:44] we understand some mysteries, but we
[3:46] need some We need some Jesus time. We
[3:49] need some time in the presence of the
[3:51] Lord. We need the atmosphere that that
[3:54] that welcomes the glory.
[3:57] The glory of God doesn't just come down
[4:00] in and on anything. It comes down in an
[4:03] atmosphere that has been carefully
[4:05] prepared to receive the presence of the
[4:08] King of glory.
[4:10] You can be preaching the right thing and
[4:12] the glory won't come.
[4:15] You can be singing the right song and
[4:16] the glory won't come. But without the
[4:19] fullness of the glory of God, we're just
[4:21] going through the motions.
[4:24] We need the fire of God. And fire
[4:26] doesn't fall on empty altars. There has
[4:29] to be a sacrifice laying up there. Dead
[4:32] to self, but a living sacrifice as unto
[4:35] the Lord. When that fire began to fall
[4:37] in the first great awakening, John
[4:40] Wesley gave this testimony. They said to
[4:42] him, "How are you getting such big
[4:44] crowds to come and hear you preach?" He
[4:48] said, "Oh, that's easy. I set myself on
[4:51] fire and the people come to watch me
[4:52] burn."
[4:55] He didn't mean with matches.
[4:58] He didn't mean with a campfire.
[5:01] He meant I consecrate. I dedicate my
[5:04] life unto the Lord so that the glory of
[5:07] God will fall on the altar. Not a
[5:11] feeling, not an emotional,
[5:15] not some physical manifestation,
[5:18] a transforming change that you walk out
[5:22] of it fully identified with Christ, the
[5:24] word and you know who you are. You don't
[5:28] have to keep doubting it.
