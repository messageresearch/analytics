[1:00:01] starting in verse six and when the woman
[1:00:04] saw that the tree was good for food
[1:00:07] and that it was pleasant to the eyes and
[1:00:09] a tree to be desired to make one wise
[1:00:12] she took of the fruit thereof and did
[1:00:15] eat
[1:00:16] and gave also to her husband with her
[1:00:19] and he did eat
[1:00:20] the eyes of them both were opened and
[1:00:23] they knew that they were naked and they
[1:00:25] sewed
[1:00:26] fig leaves together and made themselves
[1:00:29] aprons
[1:00:30] and they heard the voice of the lord god
[1:00:32] walking in the garden in the cool of the
[1:00:35] day and adam and his wife hid themselves
[1:00:38] from the presence of the lord god
[1:00:40] amongst the trees of the garden
[1:00:42] and the lord god called unto adam and
[1:00:45] said unto him
[1:00:47] where art thou
[1:00:49] and he said i heard thy voice in the
[1:00:51] garden and i was afraid because i was
[1:00:54] naked and i hid myself
[1:00:56] and he said who told thee that thou was
[1:00:58] naked hast thou eaten of the tree where
[1:01:01] have i commanded thee that thou should
[1:01:03] us not eat
[1:01:04] and the man said the woman whom thou
[1:01:06] gave us to be with me she gave me of the
[1:01:10] tree and i did eat
[1:01:13] and the lord god said unto the woman
[1:01:16] what is this
[1:01:18] that thou has done
[1:01:20] and the woman said
[1:01:21] the serpent beguiled me and i did eat
[1:01:25] chapter 4 verse 1
[1:01:30] and adam knew eve his wife and she
[1:01:32] conceived and bear cain
[1:01:35] and said i have gotten a man from the
[1:01:37] lord and she again bare his brother abel
[1:01:40] and abel was a keeper of sheep
[1:01:43] but cain was a tiller of the ground
[1:01:46] and in the process of time it came to
[1:01:48] pass that cain brought of the fruit of
[1:01:50] the ground and offering unto the lord
[1:01:53] and abel he also brought of the
[1:01:55] firstlings of his flock and of the fat
[1:01:58] thereof
[1:01:59] and the lord had respect unto abel and
[1:02:01] to his offering but unto cain and to his
[1:02:04] offering he had not respect
[1:02:06] and cain was very wroth and his
[1:02:09] countenance fell i'm reading through
[1:02:10] verse 10
[1:02:12] and the lord said unto cain why are you
[1:02:14] wroth and why is your countenance fallen
[1:02:17] if thou doest well shall thou not be
[1:02:20] accepted
[1:02:21] and if thou doest not well sin lieth at
[1:02:24] the door
[1:02:25] and unto thee shall be his desire and
[1:02:28] thou shall rule over him
[1:02:31] cain talked with abel his brother and it
[1:02:33] came to pass
[1:02:34] when they were in the field that cain
[1:02:36] rose up against abel his brother and
[1:02:38] slew him
[1:02:40] and the lord said unto cain
[1:02:42] where is abel thy brother and he said
[1:02:46] i know not
[1:02:48] am i my brother's keeper
[1:02:50] and he said
[1:02:52] what have you done
[1:02:54] and the voice of the
[1:02:57] he he said what have you done
[1:03:00] the voice of thy brother's blood
[1:03:03] crieth unto me
[1:03:06] from the ground
[1:03:07] may the lord add a blessing to the
[1:03:09] reading of his word
[1:03:11] you may have your seats today
[1:03:20] i got started on this little journey
[1:03:22] that i'm about to minister to you today
[1:03:25] from a message that brother branham
[1:03:27] preached in 1956
[1:03:30] he was
[1:03:31] talking about the true vine and the
[1:03:32] false fine in fact that's the name of
[1:03:34] the sermon the true and false vines but
[1:03:36] he made this statement
[1:03:38] if i was going to speak here next week
[1:03:40] there's one subject that i'd like to
[1:03:41] speak
[1:03:42] three questions of god
[1:03:45] where are you
[1:03:47] what is this you've done
[1:03:49] and where is your brother
[1:03:51] where are you he spoke to adam
[1:03:54] what is this that you have done he spoke
[1:03:56] to eve
[1:03:57] where is thy brother
[1:03:59] he spoke to cain
[1:04:00] three questions god asked think of it
[1:04:04] now as far as i know brother branham
[1:04:06] never preached a message involving those
[1:04:08] three questions directly but it set me
[1:04:10] on a journey and i asked myself why
[1:04:13] would brother adam want to preach a
[1:04:14] message concerning these three questions
[1:04:17] so it just started me on this little
[1:04:19] journey and and i began to think about
[1:04:21] this true vine and the false vine which
[1:04:23] is the name of this sermon where i got
[1:04:25] this thought and we know that the true
[1:04:27] vine and the false vine they grow
[1:04:30] sometimes together
[1:04:32] many times in the natural when you look
[1:04:35] out in the woods or around your house
[1:04:37] there are times where that we see that
[1:04:40] there are
[1:04:41] good vines and there are bad vines that
[1:04:44] are growing together and in the course
[1:04:46] of time they weave themselves around one
[1:04:50] another and they we we can't distinguish
[1:04:53] the one vine from the other vine and the
[1:04:56] only and and sometimes you can't tell it
[1:04:59] from the bark you can't even sometimes
[1:05:01] tell it from the leaves you can't tell
[1:05:03] it from the pod that it may put out but
[1:05:06] when it comes to its full maturity there
[1:05:10] is a way that you can tell the
[1:05:12] difference and we find out that jesus in
[1:05:15] matthew chapter 13 when he was talking
[1:05:18] about the seed he said let them grow up
[1:05:20] together
[1:05:23] remember the the field with the wheat
[1:05:26] and somebody uh
[1:05:28] the evil one went through the field and
[1:05:30] spread tears when nobody was looking and
[1:05:33] they grew up and they looked alike and
[1:05:35] and somebody wanted to go and pluck up
[1:05:37] the tares he says no no no no you just
[1:05:40] let them grow up together and when they
[1:05:42] come to the maturity then we're gonna
[1:05:45] let the distinguishing be done and so
[1:05:48] many times we we look at people
[1:05:51] because that's what we are we're people
[1:05:54] and we try to make a judgment call about
[1:05:57] whether somebody is weed or whether they
[1:05:59] are tares no just let them grow up
[1:06:01] together when it comes to maturity god
[1:06:03] will separate that all out he'll let
[1:06:05] that all be fixed up and it'll all be
[1:06:08] done right and there won't be any
[1:06:10] humanity mixed in with it there won't be
[1:06:12] any soul mixed in with it god will take
[1:06:15] care of that he is going to get that all
[1:06:19] right
[1:06:20] there won't be no wrong in that it'll be
[1:06:23] all right
[1:06:24] so adam here we find in the third
[1:06:27] chapter
[1:06:29] that now
[1:06:30] we we we want to just
[1:06:33] remind you and those that might be
[1:06:36] listening we welcome you to this service
[1:06:38] today may god bless you if there's
[1:06:41] something that you don't understand just
[1:06:43] lay it aside don't kick it out
[1:06:45] immediately just lay it aside but we
[1:06:48] find in god's word that there are times
[1:06:51] that not everything is said
[1:06:56] there are many times that god gives us
[1:06:59] information
[1:07:00] in one place and then he puts a little
[1:07:03] bit more of the information in another
[1:07:05] place and maybe a little bit more in
[1:07:07] another place and after a while by the
[1:07:10] grace of god and the goodness of him
[1:07:12] sending his revelation he starts to put
[1:07:15] the picture all together to help us to
[1:07:17] come up with a complete picture now the
[1:07:20] bible said that the serpent was more
[1:07:22] subtle than any beast of the field so
[1:07:25] that gives us an idea that this serpent
[1:07:28] did not start out on the ground but this
[1:07:31] was a beast with a beast nature but
[1:07:34] somehow he had the ability to
[1:07:37] communicate with the woman and that is
[1:07:39] where he started now we remember that
[1:07:42] the woman was not a part of that
[1:07:46] original creation in that she was a
[1:07:49] separate entity she was inside of adam
[1:07:52] and god after a while he pulled that rib
[1:07:56] out of adam and he created from the dust
[1:07:59] he created this woman
[1:08:03] and if you read you see that when god
[1:08:06] gave the instruction if i remember
[1:08:09] correctly when god gave the instruction
[1:08:12] about the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:08:14] evil and he gave them instruction about
[1:08:17] what should be taken and what should not
[1:08:20] be taken
[1:08:21] she was still inside of
[1:08:24] adam
[1:08:28] but the instruction got to her
[1:08:31] you be sure of that
[1:08:33] the instruction got to her
[1:08:35] so now
[1:08:36] the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:08:38] beast
[1:08:39] of the field which the lord god had made
[1:08:42] and he came to her
[1:08:44] with a temptation and in that temptation
[1:08:49] he drew her away from the purposes and
[1:08:53] the plan of god
[1:08:55] and when
[1:08:56] he did that
[1:08:58] there was a falling away there was a
[1:09:02] falling from the place that they were
[1:09:05] to a lower place
[1:09:10] and as we were singing let the glory
[1:09:13] fall in this room today there was a
[1:09:15] glory about them that was their covering
[1:09:19] and so when
[1:09:21] adam was
[1:09:23] after he had also partaken of this and
[1:09:27] the eyes of them both were opened
[1:09:31] god came through the garden in the cool
[1:09:35] of the evening as he had always done
[1:09:39] and he went looking for his children
[1:09:43] crying out to adam adam
[1:09:46] where are you
[1:09:50] now we've got to remember something
[1:09:52] when god asks a question
[1:09:56] he doesn't need information
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:00] when god asks a question
[1:10:03] he already knows the answer
[1:10:07] when god asks a question
[1:10:10] it is something to shake you to think
[1:10:12] about what he's asking and what your
[1:10:15] motives are behind what you're doing and
[1:10:17] so when he comes into the garden and he
[1:10:20] realizes that that adam and his wife
[1:10:24] they are not as accessible maybe as they
[1:10:26] usually are they're hiding themselves
[1:10:30] and he says adam
[1:10:32] where are you
[1:10:35] and adam had a response
[1:10:38] as we generally do
[1:10:40] and he said i heard your voice
[1:10:43] in the garden
[1:10:45] and i was afraid
[1:10:48] because i was naked
[1:10:51] and i hid myself
[1:10:55] isn't this generally what we try to do
[1:10:58] when god comes to us and he begins to
[1:11:01] inquire of us
[1:11:03] and
[1:11:04] we
[1:11:05] have pulled away from him and the the
[1:11:08] the glory of the lord has become dimmed
[1:11:11] in our life and when he comes to us can
[1:11:14] he asks where are you
[1:11:17] and we respond
[1:11:19] with a justification of some sort or
[1:11:23] we make up an excuse or we hide because
[1:11:27] we're trying to justify our guiltiness
[1:11:31] at that moment
[1:11:35] but because he's a loving papa his
[1:11:38] desire is not to come and to crush us
[1:11:41] his desire is to come and cause us to
[1:11:44] recognize where we are so that we may
[1:11:47] repent so that we can get back to our
[1:11:50] original estate
[1:11:53] he doesn't want to leave us in our
[1:11:55] downtrodden place he doesn't want to
[1:11:57] leave us down and out and cold and
[1:12:00] uncovered he wants us to be covered
[1:12:05] so he
[1:12:06] we
[1:12:07] we know that through the preaching of
[1:12:09] the word over the course of years that
[1:12:11] they they had a covering of a
[1:12:14] supernatural substance
[1:12:16] and the glory of the lord covered them
[1:12:19] and and and when they partook of the
[1:12:22] tree of knowledge of good and evil there
[1:12:25] was something that happened that caused
[1:12:28] them to drop out of the level of
[1:12:30] supernatural
[1:12:32] into a level of natural humanity that
[1:12:35] they were not originally created for
[1:12:42] and so
[1:12:45] as adam
[1:12:46] [Music]
[1:12:48] recognizes that something has changed
[1:12:51] something has shifted in his life
[1:12:54] and immediately he tries to cover
[1:12:57] himself
[1:13:00] and there is nothing that we can ever
[1:13:02] find in the natural surroundings that is
[1:13:06] good enough to cover us up to hide us to
[1:13:09] hide our nakedness from the from the
[1:13:13] from the wrath of god or from the
[1:13:14] goodness of god it's just nothing there
[1:13:18] that is enough for us to cover up but
[1:13:20] when god cries out adam where are you
[1:13:24] and he decided that he wanted to cover
[1:13:27] himself up and and that's that's
[1:13:30] generally what we try to do
[1:13:32] and we have
[1:13:34] when adam fell out of that supernatural
[1:13:36] realm into a natural realm
[1:13:39] and
[1:13:42] god comes looking for him
[1:13:45] god expected them to stay
[1:13:48] in the supernatural realm
[1:13:53] now
[1:13:56] nothing catches god by surprise
[1:14:01] nothing
[1:14:02] ever causes him
[1:14:04] to
[1:14:05] have to back up and
[1:14:07] say how am i going to get around this
[1:14:12] but he wanted adam to stay
[1:14:15] in a natural in the supernatural realm
[1:14:18] but yet something inside of this human
[1:14:21] inside of this man that was placed on
[1:14:23] the earth
[1:14:26] was
[1:14:26] there was something in him
[1:14:29] that
[1:14:31] god created
[1:14:34] and
[1:14:36] god allowed
[1:14:39] and
[1:14:40] when god came asking adam
[1:14:42] where are you
[1:14:48] adam had tried to cover himself up with
[1:14:51] something that was natural
[1:14:54] something in this realm
[1:14:56] and the natural left him naked
[1:15:01] without a covering
[1:15:06] adam tried
[1:15:09] to cover himself
[1:15:12] with something
[1:15:14] that he found
[1:15:16] in the realm where he was
[1:15:18] but it was not sufficient
[1:15:21] to cover him
[1:15:25] in a way that god thought was sufficient
[1:15:28] to cover him
[1:15:30] and so
[1:15:31] now
[1:15:33] this
[1:15:34] being adam
[1:15:36] he is now
[1:15:38] this supernatural clothing that he wore
[1:15:42] is is now either totally gone or it's in
[1:15:45] a lesser amount and he has fallen into a
[1:15:49] place where that now he is exposed to
[1:15:52] the elements of the earth in such a way
[1:15:56] that uh
[1:15:57] god found him in that condition and he
[1:16:00] knew that
[1:16:02] adam was now very susceptible to the
[1:16:05] attacks of the enemy
[1:16:09] because that he did not have the proper
[1:16:12] covering
[1:16:13] and
[1:16:15] we know that
[1:16:18] god has created us to walk in a
[1:16:21] supernatural realm
[1:16:24] i was made for that
[1:16:26] and
[1:16:28] we have been told that
[1:16:31] we bypassed
[1:16:33] a theophany body
[1:16:36] to come to this earth a celestial body
[1:16:39] we bypass that to come to this earth
[1:16:43] to demonstrate our love for our lord and
[1:16:47] that then when we were finished with
[1:16:49] this
[1:16:50] body here on the earth that we would
[1:16:54] pick up that celestial body
[1:17:05] he also said in one place
[1:17:08] that we would pick up when we die
[1:17:11] that we would pick up that celestial
[1:17:14] body and that we would stay in that
[1:17:18] celestial body
[1:17:20] until
[1:17:21] the great catching away
[1:17:24] and then we would go catch up with that
[1:17:26] glorified body
[1:17:30] now i don't have the full understanding
[1:17:32] of that but this one thing i know
[1:17:35] i was created
[1:17:38] not just for this realm
[1:17:41] but i was more created for a
[1:17:43] supernatural realm
[1:17:46] we give this phrase
[1:17:49] i'll speed up
[1:17:51] and they'll slow down
[1:17:55] and brother branham gave this statement
[1:17:57] he he was talking about a statement that
[1:18:00] einstein had made and and einstein gave
[1:18:03] this thought that if two vehicles
[1:18:06] could go fast enough
[1:18:10] and come toward each other that they
[1:18:13] could pass through each other
[1:18:17] now i haven't studied einstein i don't
[1:18:19] know
[1:18:19] all of that
[1:18:22] but then he gave another statement and
[1:18:24] he said
[1:18:25] they've got a sputnik that they're so
[1:18:27] proud of
[1:18:29] anybody know what a sputnik is
[1:18:32] probably not very many people know what
[1:18:33] sputnik is
[1:18:37] well in 57 1957
[1:18:41] the russians
[1:18:43] the ussr at the time
[1:18:46] decided to put a satellite in space
[1:18:49] and that
[1:18:50] satellite
[1:18:52] was about as big as a beach ball
[1:18:56] and if i recall they said that that
[1:18:59] sputnik it was a satellite and that it
[1:19:01] could orbit the earth
[1:19:06] in
[1:19:06] 98 hours
[1:19:09] minutes 98 minutes
[1:19:12] so they were real proud of the speed of
[1:19:15] that sputnik
[1:19:17] how fast that it could go
[1:19:20] but you'll remember when jesus after he
[1:19:23] had
[1:19:24] after he had descended into lower parts
[1:19:26] of the earth and he ascended to the
[1:19:28] father but he came back after he had
[1:19:30] been glorified he came back to the uh
[1:19:34] maybe he hadn't been glorified he come
[1:19:35] back anyhow to his disciples and he
[1:19:38] passed through the wall
[1:19:40] such a speed that he was going
[1:19:43] that the wall didn't hinder him
[1:19:46] and so
[1:19:47] that is the kind of supernatural
[1:19:50] that god had created adam to be
[1:19:53] and he
[1:19:54] adam was created
[1:19:57] and put in the garden to be a creator
[1:20:03] he was put there
[1:20:05] to be able to
[1:20:07] be able to
[1:20:09] enter into time and space
[1:20:12] and perhaps to come back out of time and
[1:20:14] space with
[1:20:16] ease
[1:20:18] just as jesus did
[1:20:21] in and out of time and space back into
[1:20:23] eternity out time and space back to
[1:20:25] eternity see this is what we were really
[1:20:28] created for
[1:20:29] and so when adam
[1:20:31] found himself in this place and god
[1:20:34] comes to him and says where are you
[1:20:38] and adam says i was naked and i had to
[1:20:41] hide myself from you and and i realized
[1:20:45] that there's something that has happened
[1:20:47] and so uh
[1:20:49] god said
[1:20:52] fig leaves ain't gonna work
[1:20:59] big leaves aren't going to be enough
[1:21:02] then you go to the book of the
[1:21:03] revelation
[1:21:05] when when when
[1:21:07] the angel was speaking to john
[1:21:09] concerning the laodicean church age
[1:21:12] and he told the he recognized and told
[1:21:15] that the people were poor
[1:21:17] wretched
[1:21:19] blind
[1:21:21] and naked
[1:21:23] and they didn't know it
[1:21:28] now adam had enough sense to recognize
[1:21:31] that he was naked
[1:21:34] and he tried to cover himself up when
[1:21:37] god came asking this question where are
[1:21:40] you
[1:21:42] adam was trying to cover himself up and
[1:21:45] so often we we think of ways that people
[1:21:49] try to cover themselves up with their
[1:21:52] religious ideas and it doesn't work
[1:21:56] because religious ideas will never
[1:21:59] clothe you
[1:22:00] properly enough for you to speed back up
[1:22:05] into supernatural
[1:22:10] jesus said i counsel of you
[1:22:14] to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[1:22:18] and white raiment that the shame of your
[1:22:21] nakedness does not appear there's
[1:22:24] something about the glory of god that
[1:22:27] he's inviting us to come back into
[1:22:31] when he asked the question to adam where
[1:22:34] are you he had no desire for adam to
[1:22:37] stay in that place
[1:22:39] nor did he ever have desire for adam's
[1:22:42] race to stay in that place and so
[1:22:45] because all of this had happened he
[1:22:48] already had a plan put in motion
[1:22:52] it's already put in motion
[1:22:56] but to start with
[1:22:58] there had to be
[1:23:00] the bloody skins
[1:23:02] of the lamb
[1:23:04] to be placed upon their backs
[1:23:07] because fig leaves was not sufficient
[1:23:10] we move on
[1:23:13] after adam gives his
[1:23:16] his
[1:23:18] thought as to why that he's trying to
[1:23:20] cover himself up when god comes
[1:23:23] to
[1:23:24] ask him where he is
[1:23:26] the man the woman
[1:23:28] of course
[1:23:29] adam put some of the blame over on her
[1:23:32] the woman you gave me
[1:23:35] she gave me of the tree and i did eat
[1:23:39] because god has added revelation on
[1:23:42] revelation we know that this is a type
[1:23:44] of what is to come this is the nature of
[1:23:48] christ to to cover uh to cover and and
[1:23:52] that's what adam was doing here but when
[1:23:54] god comes and asks him about it is that
[1:23:57] woman
[1:24:01] so the lord said unto the woman
[1:24:04] what is this that you have done
[1:24:13] she did the same kind of thing that adam
[1:24:15] i mean they were both hiding behind the
[1:24:17] fig leaves
[1:24:19] both of them were
[1:24:23] and
[1:24:24] her answer or her fig leaf
[1:24:28] her excuse
[1:24:32] her response back to god was
[1:24:35] the serpent beguiled me
[1:24:40] now
[1:24:41] again i say remember when god asks a
[1:24:43] question
[1:24:45] he already knows the answer
[1:24:47] he doesn't need my excuse he doesn't
[1:24:49] need your excuse
[1:24:51] he is trying to get us to when god asks
[1:24:54] a question he is trying to get us to
[1:24:57] understand uh that that we are not in
[1:25:01] our proper place
[1:25:06] we're not in our
[1:25:09] truest
[1:25:11] form
[1:25:12] and he is desiring to pull us
[1:25:16] to a place where that his sweet holy
[1:25:19] spirit can renew us once again
[1:25:23] and so many times
[1:25:25] we offer god excuses
[1:25:31] god comes and asks us a question
[1:25:35] we always got to have an answer
[1:25:38] it's human nature
[1:25:43] the best thing we could do
[1:25:46] would be
[1:25:47] to fall on our face
[1:25:50] say lord i am sorry
[1:25:54] but the question to the woman was what
[1:25:56] is this that you have done
[1:26:00] and she responded the serpent beguiled
[1:26:03] me
[1:26:04] and i did eat now i want you to think
[1:26:06] about this question
[1:26:08] that god has just asked her
[1:26:12] because
[1:26:14] what have you done
[1:26:16] had ramifications for
[1:26:18] all the way up till now
[1:26:21] and until we're caught up out of this
[1:26:23] place and until god comes and cleanses
[1:26:26] the earth with fire
[1:26:29] now
[1:26:30] when we read the book of genesis we can
[1:26:32] see that there are the beasts of the
[1:26:35] field
[1:26:36] we can see that there are the fish of
[1:26:39] the water
[1:26:40] we can see that there are birds of the
[1:26:42] air
[1:26:43] but none of those species
[1:26:46] had the ability
[1:26:48] to speak
[1:26:50] and create
[1:26:53] only adam
[1:26:55] had the ability
[1:26:57] to speak
[1:26:59] and create is that correct
[1:27:04] so now
[1:27:06] when god poses this question to the
[1:27:09] woman
[1:27:10] and i say the woman because she does not
[1:27:13] yet have her own name
[1:27:16] she is still very much a part of adam
[1:27:19] under one name
[1:27:21] that is why we baptize him part of the
[1:27:23] reason we baptize in the name of the
[1:27:27] lord jesus christ because it's one name
[1:27:31] he's bringing us the bride and the groom
[1:27:33] together under one name i don't carry my
[1:27:36] own i carry his
[1:27:39] so all of these beasts of the field fish
[1:27:42] of the air and then fowl of the or fowl
[1:27:44] of the air and fish of the sea they
[1:27:46] don't have a voice to create but god
[1:27:48] gave
[1:27:49] away
[1:27:51] for
[1:27:53] adam
[1:27:54] his voice
[1:27:56] to create
[1:27:58] it so happened that a tree might need to
[1:28:00] be moved
[1:28:01] be thou moved
[1:28:04] over here
[1:28:05] the voice
[1:28:07] of creation was in adam
[1:28:10] but now because of this fall when god
[1:28:13] asks the woman this question
[1:28:17] what is this that you have done
[1:28:23] she said
[1:28:24] the serpent
[1:28:26] beguiled me
[1:28:28] i want you to think about this
[1:28:31] because the serpent
[1:28:33] was more subtle
[1:28:36] than any beast
[1:28:39] of the field
[1:28:44] the beast
[1:28:45] of the field again
[1:28:49] when this happened
[1:28:51] was not crawling around
[1:28:53] on the ground as a
[1:28:55] snake or serpent
[1:28:58] as we know it today
[1:29:00] but it was the curse that god laid upon
[1:29:02] that
[1:29:04] beast
[1:29:06] because
[1:29:07] of what he
[1:29:08] did whether it was
[1:29:12] a spirit that
[1:29:13] pressed its way into the serpent and
[1:29:16] used the serpent's body and voice to
[1:29:18] speak i don't know exactly how that all
[1:29:22] of that
[1:29:23] looked in detail but
[1:29:26] the serpent was used to speak to the
[1:29:29] woman and because of that the beast was
[1:29:32] put on its belly the rest of its days
[1:29:36] now i want you to notice here because
[1:29:40] what have you done
[1:29:41] [Music]
[1:29:45] god is asking her a question
[1:29:48] and all of the sudden can you imagine
[1:29:53] this thought
[1:29:55] as god asks this question
[1:29:58] what have you done
[1:30:01] because of what you have done
[1:30:05] you have lowered
[1:30:09] the human race
[1:30:11] to the level of obese nature
[1:30:22] that
[1:30:23] that's what she did right
[1:30:27] if you believe what i believe
[1:30:30] she partook
[1:30:32] of the nature of the beast
[1:30:37] and then she went and offered it to her
[1:30:40] husband
[1:30:42] and
[1:30:43] when she offered it
[1:30:45] to her husband
[1:30:48] they now
[1:30:51] are at a lower place than they were
[1:30:53] remember the covering is gone from them
[1:30:57] they are
[1:30:58] now in a lower form i i don't know maybe
[1:31:02] how long that it took for them to
[1:31:05] become afraid of of the beasts of the
[1:31:09] field
[1:31:10] uh not just the one that was subtle but
[1:31:13] the lion and the cheetah and the fox and
[1:31:16] anything that we now would think of that
[1:31:19] might harm a human being uh how soon
[1:31:22] that they might have become afraid of
[1:31:24] that but they're now
[1:31:26] reduced
[1:31:29] to a lower level
[1:31:32] but again god did not ask this question
[1:31:34] because he wanted them to remain
[1:31:38] in that lower form
[1:31:40] he asked this question because he wanted
[1:31:44] her to recognize what she had done he
[1:31:47] she was he was drawing her
[1:31:50] to a place of repentance
[1:31:52] just as he does for you
[1:31:54] just as he does for me
[1:31:56] he wants he is desiring for us to
[1:32:00] come to a place of repentance so after
[1:32:04] this happened and he begins
[1:32:06] to let her know that she is now
[1:32:09] in a uh she is really got a beast nature
[1:32:14] and
[1:32:15] let's be real honest without christ
[1:32:18] that's what we have
[1:32:21] it doesn't take much to recognize this
[1:32:24] that is what humanity is yes there are a
[1:32:27] lot of good people but at the base of it
[1:32:29] there is the beast nature
[1:32:32] and so god speaks to her and says in
[1:32:34] sorrow
[1:32:36] you shall bring forth children
[1:32:39] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[1:32:42] and he shall rule over thee
[1:32:47] now this is a
[1:32:48] this is something that doesn't fly too
[1:32:51] high in 2022.
[1:32:56] and i don't know whether you have
[1:32:58] recognized it or not
[1:33:01] but has anybody recognized how many
[1:33:04] women have gotten into politics
[1:33:10] i mean it seems like every time you turn
[1:33:12] around another
[1:33:14] woman is being elected
[1:33:16] to a political office
[1:33:18] i am not a male chauvinist i am not
[1:33:21] somebody that doesn't think that they
[1:33:22] are fully capable
[1:33:24] but i am uh
[1:33:28] perceptive enough in the scripture to
[1:33:30] realize that this is probably not a good
[1:33:33] thing
[1:33:36] because
[1:33:37] it means that a woman is out of her
[1:33:40] god-given role
[1:33:43] when a woman is trying to usurp
[1:33:46] authority
[1:33:48] whether it's
[1:33:49] be in the household or whether it be in
[1:33:52] a job or whether it be in politics she
[1:33:55] is out of her position
[1:33:58] according to the word of god she is out
[1:34:00] of her position i know that that's
[1:34:03] probably not real good to say from the
[1:34:05] pulpit but this is the truth because
[1:34:08] that god said you are to be subject to
[1:34:11] your husband because of what you've done
[1:34:15] we can go to the new testament and we
[1:34:17] can see the apostle paul say that the
[1:34:20] women are to be the keepers at home
[1:34:22] they're supposed to be taking care of
[1:34:24] their children and and so uh for a while
[1:34:28] that's the way it was and and the enemy
[1:34:30] found out that beast nature remember
[1:34:32] this is the beast nature says well in
[1:34:35] order for us to get the woman out from
[1:34:38] under the rule of the man once again
[1:34:41] what we have to do is we've got to make
[1:34:43] things so hard till people think that
[1:34:46] they've got to have two incomes in order
[1:34:48] to support the household we got to be
[1:34:50] able to get the woman out of the house
[1:34:52] we got to send the children down to
[1:34:54] egypt to school and we got to make sure
[1:34:56] that we keep them all so out of sorts
[1:34:59] and out of their proper roles until that
[1:35:02] the woman is no longer in her proper
[1:35:04] place
[1:35:08] now men
[1:35:10] if you mistreat your wife
[1:35:14] you're wrong
[1:35:16] you are wrong
[1:35:18] [Music]
[1:35:19] your wife is to be your queen your
[1:35:22] sweetheart
[1:35:23] she is to be treated with utmost respect
[1:35:26] she is to be treated with honor in the
[1:35:29] home and she has her proper place in the
[1:35:32] home in fact brother branham says she is
[1:35:35] a pastor to her children
[1:35:37] so ladies if you have children in the
[1:35:40] home you are the shepherd to those
[1:35:42] children and god gave you a god-ordained
[1:35:47] place there to shepherd those children
[1:35:50] to instill in those children godly
[1:35:53] principles godly thought godly goodness
[1:35:57] and when a husband can stand
[1:35:59] behind his wife stand with her in
[1:36:03] training those children friends if we
[1:36:05] don't train our children
[1:36:09] if we don't train them properly
[1:36:12] they're going to go off the rails
[1:36:17] and they're going to go after the beast
[1:36:20] nature because that's
[1:36:22] just it's what's in us
[1:36:25] we came to the world speaking lies
[1:36:28] we have a nature in us that goes after
[1:36:32] the lower things rather than the higher
[1:36:34] things but all thanks be to god there's
[1:36:37] something that god has already put in
[1:36:40] this earth and he they placed a calling
[1:36:42] in our lives and he said you parents
[1:36:45] hold the token over your children you
[1:36:47] just pray over them and hold the token
[1:36:50] over them if they're wayward then
[1:36:52] believe that god will bring them back if
[1:36:54] they're in your household hold the token
[1:36:56] over them
[1:36:58] don't let them go
[1:36:59] [Music]
[1:37:02] it's not all the preacher's job to teach
[1:37:04] these children
[1:37:07] because some of the things that we say
[1:37:09] from this desk goes over their head and
[1:37:11] it is the responsibility of the mom and
[1:37:14] the dad to be able to sit down with
[1:37:16] their children and break these things
[1:37:18] down a little bit further than we can as
[1:37:21] a body you know your children you know
[1:37:23] what their susceptibilities are you know
[1:37:26] what they're up against and so you as a
[1:37:28] parent have been given your children and
[1:37:31] god gave them to you because he knew
[1:37:33] that you had the qualities to be able to
[1:37:36] instill in them the word of god the
[1:37:39] goodness of god and so he's just
[1:37:41] allowing you to
[1:37:43] give him one more step
[1:37:44] in the word of god
[1:37:47] so that they
[1:37:49] will come to recognize that they
[1:37:52] also must repent and call on the name of
[1:37:55] the lord and be filled with the baptism
[1:37:57] of the holy ghost and be baptized in the
[1:37:59] name of the lord jesus christ and follow
[1:38:01] on to know more and more of the truth of
[1:38:04] god
[1:38:06] so he told the woman i'm going to put
[1:38:08] enmity
[1:38:10] see this is some more of that where you
[1:38:12] got to read between the lines
[1:38:15] i'm going to put inmate between thee
[1:38:18] he said this to the serpent i'm going to
[1:38:20] put enmity between thee
[1:38:22] and the woman
[1:38:24] and between thy seed
[1:38:27] and her
[1:38:28] seed now when you read that
[1:38:32] you know that there had to be some seed
[1:38:34] somewhere
[1:38:38] i'm going to put enmity between you and
[1:38:40] the serpent
[1:38:42] and i'm going to put enmity between
[1:38:44] the seed of the woman and the seed of
[1:38:46] the serpent
[1:38:48] and so
[1:38:53] we
[1:38:54] are about to see here
[1:38:57] that more of the beast nature is going
[1:39:00] to be magnified
[1:39:02] but god has an end purpose
[1:39:04] and god is always just
[1:39:08] in his judgments
[1:39:15] when we stand before the lord
[1:39:19] we can never say god you are unfair
[1:39:26] god is
[1:39:28] god doesn't operate in time
[1:39:31] god operates in eternity
[1:39:37] and in eternity
[1:39:39] there is no time
[1:39:42] and so when we talk about a measure of
[1:39:45] time in this dimension
[1:39:49] to god it's just a puff of air
[1:39:54] a breath
[1:39:55] a millisecond
[1:39:59] it doesn't even register
[1:40:01] on his time clock
[1:40:04] if i lived to be 70 or 80 years
[1:40:07] 90 years 100 years
[1:40:11] it
[1:40:12] in eternity
[1:40:14] it's not hardly a blip
[1:40:17] as far as time is concerned
[1:40:20] but
[1:40:20] remember
[1:40:22] my name is on the lamb's book of life so
[1:40:24] i do matter and you matter
[1:40:28] what is this you've done
[1:40:31] what
[1:40:33] have you conceived
[1:40:38] now i've added there the scripture does
[1:40:40] not say what have you conceived
[1:40:43] god asked her what have you done
[1:40:50] i am adding this thought what have you
[1:40:52] conceived
[1:40:54] see she first
[1:40:56] had to receive it here
[1:40:59] proverbs 23 verse 6.
[1:41:04] eat thou not the bread of him that hath
[1:41:06] an evil eye
[1:41:09] neither desire thou his dainty meats
[1:41:14] for as he thinketh in his heart
[1:41:17] so is he
[1:41:20] eden drink saith he to thee
[1:41:23] but his heart is not with thee
[1:41:27] the morsel
[1:41:29] which thou has eaten shall thou vomit it
[1:41:32] up
[1:41:33] and lose
[1:41:35] thy sweet words
[1:41:37] now i'm just going to throw this out
[1:41:40] because i believe this is another one of
[1:41:42] those ways that god
[1:41:43] lets us read between the lines
[1:41:48] we are talking about something that
[1:41:50] happened between
[1:41:52] the woman and the serpent
[1:41:55] and i just ask you
[1:42:00] what generally happens
[1:42:03] when a woman conceives
[1:42:10] the morsel which thou hast eaten shalt
[1:42:13] thou
[1:42:14] vomit it up
[1:42:16] and lose thy sweet words
[1:42:20] just a thought maybe i'm taking
[1:42:22] scripture out of context
[1:42:25] but let's go to another one
[1:42:29] proverbs
[1:42:30] chapter 30
[1:42:33] verse 20.
[1:42:39] such is the way
[1:42:41] of an adulterous woman
[1:42:44] she eateth
[1:42:46] and wipeth her mouth
[1:42:48] and saith
[1:42:50] i have done no wickedness
[1:42:56] now why do we have to have
[1:42:59] adulteress
[1:43:01] in front of woman
[1:43:03] and what does eating have to do with
[1:43:04] wickedness
[1:43:08] sila
[1:43:12] what is this you've done
[1:43:14] you know i can't even begin to imagine
[1:43:16] the horrible feeling
[1:43:18] of darkness
[1:43:20] that must have
[1:43:22] descended down over these two
[1:43:24] individuals at this time
[1:43:26] they've already tried to hide themselves
[1:43:29] they have tried to
[1:43:34] give excuses as to why they're trying to
[1:43:36] cover up their nakedness
[1:43:40] and
[1:43:40] [Music]
[1:43:42] god is having none of it
[1:43:44] and he tells them that he's going to put
[1:43:47] enmity between the woman and her see and
[1:43:50] the woman and the serpent and her seed
[1:43:52] and his seed and he's gonna bruise your
[1:43:55] head and thou shalt bruise his heel we
[1:43:57] know this is talking of a future day and
[1:44:00] then we see that uh
[1:44:03] god tells adam that the ground is going
[1:44:05] to be cursed
[1:44:07] for his sake
[1:44:08] and in sorrow he's going to eat all all
[1:44:11] the days of his life there's going to be
[1:44:12] thorns and thistles he's going to have
[1:44:15] to work by the sweat of his face uh
[1:44:18] and all of this is a change for them
[1:44:24] this is not
[1:44:26] the same joy that they had previously
[1:44:30] where that they had the power of the
[1:44:32] spoken word
[1:44:35] they have fallen from that original
[1:44:37] estate now
[1:44:39] because of what the woman has done that
[1:44:42] adam has also partaken of they are both
[1:44:46] naked god asks them the question
[1:44:48] where are you
[1:44:50] and what have you done
[1:44:52] but god always makes a way
[1:44:55] and he placed upon them
[1:44:58] these bloody skins and he protected the
[1:45:01] way to the tree of life the cherubim
[1:45:04] with the flame and sword were placed
[1:45:06] there lest they should go and partake of
[1:45:09] that tree
[1:45:11] and live forever
[1:45:14] in their fallen state god had to protect
[1:45:17] them see that's the mercies of god
[1:45:21] god could have let us go to hell
[1:45:24] he could have allowed us
[1:45:27] or said to us
[1:45:29] you're as bad as the next one
[1:45:32] i have no place for you
[1:45:36] but somewhere
[1:45:39] by the mercies of god he looked ahead in
[1:45:42] time
[1:45:43] and he saw that i would make a right
[1:45:46] choice somewhere along the way that he
[1:45:49] could give me a by the foreknowledge of
[1:45:52] god he could give me a prefix destiny he
[1:45:55] knew that i would be willing to call on
[1:45:58] him somewhere along the way
[1:46:01] so then we go on to chapter four adam
[1:46:04] knew his wife and she conceived and bear
[1:46:06] cain and said i have gotten a man from
[1:46:08] the lord we know that all life comes
[1:46:11] from god he is the creator the enemy is
[1:46:13] not the creator and she again bear his
[1:46:16] brother abel and abel was a keeper of
[1:46:19] sheep but cain was the tiller of the
[1:46:21] ground
[1:46:22] and
[1:46:23] in the process of time cain brought of
[1:46:26] the fruit of the ground
[1:46:29] now i just told you the previous chapter
[1:46:32] tells us that god told adam that the
[1:46:34] ground would be cursed
[1:46:37] for his sake
[1:46:39] now
[1:46:40] cain
[1:46:42] is bringing an offering
[1:46:44] of the fruit of the ground
[1:46:47] and he tries to offer it to the lord
[1:46:53] process of time
[1:46:56] that means they had to grow up
[1:46:59] become old enough to recognize
[1:47:02] that
[1:47:03] there was a necessity to bring an
[1:47:05] offering to the lord
[1:47:09] they brought their offering to the lord
[1:47:11] cain brought of the fruit of the ground
[1:47:13] the ground that was cursed and abel
[1:47:16] brought to firstling of his flocks and
[1:47:18] of the fat thereof and the lord had
[1:47:21] respect unto abel and to his offering
[1:47:24] but unto cain and his offering he had
[1:47:26] not respect and cain was very wrought
[1:47:29] and his countenance fell
[1:47:32] and so the lord starts asking him these
[1:47:34] questions why are you so mad why is your
[1:47:36] countenance fallen
[1:47:38] if you do well
[1:47:40] won't you be accepted and if not sin
[1:47:42] lies at the door
[1:47:45] and so we see then that cain came to
[1:47:48] talk to his brother
[1:47:50] abel
[1:47:52] abel's sacrifice
[1:47:55] was accepted
[1:47:58] i want you to see here
[1:48:00] if you don't already know
[1:48:04] adam and the woman adam and his wife
[1:48:07] they attempted to take
[1:48:10] something
[1:48:11] of the fruit
[1:48:13] of the ground
[1:48:14] to cover up their nakedness
[1:48:21] god came to them and told them that
[1:48:23] won't work
[1:48:25] and he took a lamb
[1:48:28] and he placed these bloody skins on them
[1:48:32] to cover up their nakedness
[1:48:37] as they are growing up
[1:48:40] i am sure that they were
[1:48:44] told the story of how that they had
[1:48:47] fallen from their place that they were
[1:48:50] and
[1:48:51] adam would tell how that he tried to
[1:48:55] hide from god and how that god came and
[1:48:58] found them and posed this question to
[1:49:01] them and asked his mother you know what
[1:49:04] are you doing and why have you done this
[1:49:07] and that bloody skins were necessary god
[1:49:12] chose the bloody skins to cover them up
[1:49:17] i don't know how many times the bible
[1:49:19] doesn't even record that they ever told
[1:49:21] the children that this is what had
[1:49:22] happened
[1:49:23] this is where you have to read between
[1:49:25] the lines and you have to uh use some
[1:49:29] some thought about how that you instruct
[1:49:31] your children you tell your children
[1:49:33] stories of your childhood you tell your
[1:49:36] stories of when you were an adolescent
[1:49:39] or a young married couple and things
[1:49:41] that went wrong and things that went
[1:49:43] right you just tell these stories to
[1:49:45] your children and so i'm making a
[1:49:47] supposition that that is indeed what
[1:49:50] adam and eve did with their children
[1:49:52] they told these stories of how we we you
[1:49:55] know
[1:49:57] we weren't real smart we just knew that
[1:49:58] we were naked and and we tried to cover
[1:50:01] ourselves up and we we went and found
[1:50:03] the biggest leaf we could find to try to
[1:50:06] cover ourselves because we knew that god
[1:50:08] was going to come down and and we felt
[1:50:11] our nakedness and so we looked for
[1:50:13] something to cover ourselves up but god
[1:50:16] came around and he said that that ain't
[1:50:18] going to work that that religion that we
[1:50:20] tried was not going to work that natural
[1:50:22] stuff that we tried was not going to
[1:50:24] work that it was going to take something
[1:50:26] more that it was going to take a bloody
[1:50:29] sacrifice in order to cover up what i
[1:50:33] had done
[1:50:36] perhaps these stories were told to the
[1:50:38] children
[1:50:40] but in the process of time
[1:50:42] the boys recognized that they needed to
[1:50:44] make sacrifice to the lord
[1:50:46] both of them came to the lord
[1:50:50] but cain brought of the fruit of the
[1:50:52] ground
[1:50:54] abel
[1:50:55] brought a lamb
[1:50:59] divine revelation
[1:51:01] divine understanding
[1:51:04] just listening to his mom and dad i
[1:51:06] don't know
[1:51:08] i'd like to think that it was divine
[1:51:10] revelation
[1:51:11] because he had paid attention to his
[1:51:13] daddy
[1:51:14] he and he heard the instruction of his
[1:51:17] dad through the years that there's no
[1:51:20] way son there is no way in your own
[1:51:23] abilities that you could ever come up
[1:51:25] with enough religion to cover up your
[1:51:28] nakedness or to cover your sin there is
[1:51:31] nothing that you can do to make that
[1:51:33] possible you have got to have the blood
[1:51:36] of the lamb on you you have got to have
[1:51:39] blood and maybe cain he you know because
[1:51:42] he was of that wicked one the scripture
[1:51:44] says he was of that wicked one he
[1:51:46] thought that he could do it his way and
[1:51:48] he tried just the same way that adam and
[1:51:51] and he did you know took of the fruit of
[1:51:53] the ground and which was already cursed
[1:51:56] and he brought it to the lord and god
[1:51:58] did not have respect to his offering and
[1:52:02] it caused
[1:52:04] cain to resent his brother
[1:52:10] and so he called his brother out into
[1:52:13] the field
[1:52:14] and he slew
[1:52:16] his brother
[1:52:19] and god comes and asks him this question
[1:52:24] where
[1:52:26] is abel
[1:52:28] my brother
[1:52:31] what was
[1:52:32] his answer
[1:52:37] the first answer he gave was a lie
[1:52:49] i don't know
[1:52:53] where's your brother
[1:52:55] i don't know
[1:53:00] how many times have we gave the same
[1:53:01] kind of an answer
[1:53:06] when
[1:53:07] we for sure knew
[1:53:11] but we're trying to avoid
[1:53:13] a punishment
[1:53:18] but again god does not ask a question
[1:53:23] because he wants to crush you underneath
[1:53:25] god is asking a question because he's
[1:53:27] trying to draw you to repentance
[1:53:31] where is abel thy brother i don't know
[1:53:34] am i my brother's keeper
[1:53:37] so now he has
[1:53:39] a lie
[1:53:41] and he all adds to it
[1:53:43] an irresponsible
[1:53:45] flippant answer
[1:53:47] am i my brother's keeper
[1:53:51] he has a resentment
[1:53:53] against his brother
[1:53:56] because god accepted the sacrifice of
[1:53:59] his brother
[1:54:00] and now he has a resentment that he's
[1:54:03] even being asked so asked about it but
[1:54:06] he has so much of the beast nature in
[1:54:08] him that he's trying to
[1:54:12] cover himself up again
[1:54:14] with fig leaves
[1:54:18] now i want you to look at this
[1:54:21] with me just a second
[1:54:23] god asks adam
[1:54:25] where are you
[1:54:27] he asked the woman
[1:54:29] what is this you've done
[1:54:31] and he asks cain
[1:54:34] where is your brother
[1:54:37] and we already know what has happened to
[1:54:39] his brother
[1:54:41] john 10 10 says that keith the the thief
[1:54:45] cometh not
[1:54:47] but for to steal
[1:54:49] to kill
[1:54:51] and to destroy
[1:54:55] the thief cometh not but for to steal
[1:54:58] what happened here with adam
[1:55:00] where are you adam
[1:55:02] his covering had been taken away
[1:55:06] to steal
[1:55:09] we go to destroy for eve
[1:55:11] because when she accepted what the
[1:55:14] serpent was saying to her the beguiling
[1:55:17] of the serpent
[1:55:19] there was the thief was after a
[1:55:21] destruction
[1:55:23] of
[1:55:24] the very nature of god in humanity that
[1:55:28] was what he was after
[1:55:30] and to kill we know that that is what
[1:55:32] cain did to his brother abel but cain
[1:55:35] says
[1:55:35] i don't know
[1:55:37] i don't know
[1:55:38] am i my brother's keeper
[1:55:41] remember
[1:55:43] luke chapter 10
[1:55:47] jesus was being questioned and
[1:55:51] he's telling
[1:55:52] believe the rich young ruler
[1:55:54] he's talking to him
[1:55:56] rich young ruler says who is my neighbor
[1:56:00] luke chapter 10
[1:56:02] let's get it right
[1:56:04] luke chapter 10
[1:56:10] verse 25
[1:56:13] a certain lawyer stood up tempted him
[1:56:14] saying master what shall i do to inherit
[1:56:16] eternal life
[1:56:18] he said unto him what is written in the
[1:56:20] law how read us thou
[1:56:22] and he said he answering said thou shalt
[1:56:24] love the lord thy god with all thy heart
[1:56:25] with all thy soul with all thy strength
[1:56:28] with all thy mind and thy neighbor as
[1:56:30] thyself
[1:56:32] and he said unto him thou has answered
[1:56:34] right this do and thou shall live
[1:56:37] but he said but he
[1:56:40] oh
[1:56:44] oh
[1:56:46] this looks like what cain did
[1:56:48] but he willing to justify himself said
[1:56:51] unto jesus
[1:56:52] who's my neighbor
[1:56:56] jesus answering said a certain man went
[1:56:59] down from jerusalem to jericho and fell
[1:57:01] among thieves who stripped him of his
[1:57:02] raiment wounded him departed leaving him
[1:57:05] half dead by chance there came down a
[1:57:07] certain priest that way when he saw him
[1:57:09] he passed by on the other side and
[1:57:11] likewise a levite when he was at that
[1:57:13] place came and looked on him and passed
[1:57:15] by on the other side but a certain
[1:57:17] samaritan as he journeyed
[1:57:19] came where he was and when he saw him he
[1:57:22] had
[1:57:23] compassion on him
[1:57:25] went to him bound up his wounds pouring
[1:57:28] in oil and wine set him on his own beast
[1:57:30] brought him to the end took care of him
[1:57:32] and on the morrow when he departed he
[1:57:33] took out two pence gave it to the host
[1:57:35] and said to him take care of him
[1:57:37] whatever you spend more when i come
[1:57:39] again i'll repay you which now of these
[1:57:41] three thinketh thou was neighbor unto
[1:57:44] him that fell among the thieves and he
[1:57:46] said he that showed mercy on him then
[1:57:48] said jesus unto him
[1:57:50] go and do thou likewise now we can see
[1:57:54] in the instance with cain he gave an
[1:57:56] answer because he uh he already knew
[1:58:01] but again this was a response when god
[1:58:04] asks you a question he's trying to draw
[1:58:07] you to a place of repentance to give a
[1:58:09] truthful answer about things but see
[1:58:12] friends this is what we continue to do
[1:58:14] as humanity we try to hide behind things
[1:58:18] and we try to uh uh
[1:58:21] we we try to
[1:58:23] um
[1:58:24] make it till that these things that
[1:58:26] we're hiding behind we use excuses we
[1:58:30] use different things to try to uh tell
[1:58:33] the lord i'm all right i'm all right i'm
[1:58:35] all right when when reality god is
[1:58:38] wanting us to give ourselves so fully
[1:58:41] unto him till that we say i messed up
[1:58:47] i messed up
[1:58:49] and
[1:58:50] i want to
[1:58:52] come clean with you lord and i want to
[1:58:55] have
[1:58:56] so much cleanness in me until that you
[1:59:00] can again clothe me with the
[1:59:02] supernatural see friends the bride is
[1:59:05] going to come to that place
[1:59:08] she is coming to that place she is in
[1:59:12] the process the judgment seat of christ
[1:59:15] is among us and he is allowing us to go
[1:59:19] through a judgment right here
[1:59:21] and he's beckoning us to to repentance
[1:59:24] he's beckoning us to give more of
[1:59:27] ourselves to him because he desires
[1:59:30] for us to be once again clothed
[1:59:34] with himself
[1:59:42] throughout history
[1:59:44] god would raise up
[1:59:46] righteous seed
[1:59:48] and the enemy
[1:59:50] was always present to try to destroy
[1:59:53] that
[1:59:56] seed when it came up against jesus
[1:59:59] christ
[2:00:01] he came up against
[2:00:03] brother branham said when the devil hit
[2:00:06] jesus he hit a 10 000 volt line and it
[2:00:10] singed his feathers
[2:00:14] and that is the way
[2:00:17] that adam was
[2:00:20] adam had that much authority
[2:00:24] but because he covered his wife
[2:00:28] he stepped out from under that and he
[2:00:30] had to try to cover himself with fig
[2:00:32] leaves
[2:00:34] now
[2:00:35] the thief
[2:00:36] comes to steal
[2:00:38] to kill and to destroy
[2:00:42] where are you
[2:00:44] what have you done
[2:00:47] and where is your brother
[2:00:51] jesus has come
[2:00:53] that we might have life
[2:00:56] and that we might have it
[2:00:59] more abundantly
[2:01:02] the enemy is always out to steal
[2:01:06] to kill and to destroy
[2:01:10] and when you find
[2:01:12] the holy spirit coming to you whether it
[2:01:14] would be something that you hear
[2:01:16] whispered in your spirit whether it's
[2:01:18] something that you recognize when you're
[2:01:20] reading the word of god when you hear it
[2:01:22] across the pulpit when you hear it in a
[2:01:24] recorded sermon when you hear the holy
[2:01:27] spirit asking you a question where are
[2:01:30] you
[2:01:31] what have you done
[2:01:33] you see my lord is not the accuser of
[2:01:36] the brethren
[2:01:38] he does not come to ask you a question
[2:01:41] to accuse you
[2:01:43] because there's already somebody that is
[2:01:45] doing that and doing it with spectacular
[2:01:50] quality
[2:01:53] every day
[2:01:55] accusations of the enemy you don't
[2:01:57] believe me why are you going through
[2:01:59] such a mind battle
[2:02:01] because you have allowed the accuser of
[2:02:03] the brethren i have allowed the accuser
[2:02:05] of the brethren to remain accusing me
[2:02:09] when really i have the authority by the
[2:02:12] baptism of the holy ghost to put him
[2:02:14] back in his place
[2:02:18] but he is daily accusing me
[2:02:21] even when i know that i have gone off
[2:02:23] the track a little bit when i have
[2:02:25] failed the lord a little bit and the
[2:02:27] enemy is there accusing me
[2:02:30] but the lord comes to asks me and asks
[2:02:32] me the question where are you
[2:02:37] what have you done
[2:02:39] it is not because he desires for me to
[2:02:41] remain in that place
[2:02:43] or to go even lower
[2:02:46] it is because that he is a redeemer
[2:02:50] and he desires to bring me back to my
[2:02:53] place that i was originally thought of
[2:02:56] in his mind where that i have the spoken
[2:02:59] word once again operating in its
[2:03:02] fullness in my mouth
[2:03:04] it's there
[2:03:08] but he can't allow me to
[2:03:10] use it in its fullness
[2:03:13] because
[2:03:14] he can't yet trust me to use it in its
[2:03:18] infancy
[2:03:20] in my life
[2:03:24] otherwise the accuser wouldn't keep you
[2:03:26] know
[2:03:30] but i'm gaining ground
[2:03:32] you're gaining ground
[2:03:34] and we're recognizing that the thief
[2:03:36] comes to steal
[2:03:38] to kill
[2:03:39] to destroy
[2:03:41] but jesus has come that we could have
[2:03:43] life and that we could have it more
[2:03:45] abundantly and he's asking us the
[2:03:48] question because he wants us to come to
[2:03:51] a place that we're repenting before him
[2:04:00] i want to be so in love with jesus
[2:04:02] christ
[2:04:06] until
[2:04:09] that i am so
[2:04:12] aware
[2:04:14] when i do something wrong
[2:04:18] that i do not have to get
[2:04:21] into a twisted up place
[2:04:24] where that he comes
[2:04:26] and he asks me a question what are you
[2:04:29] doing
[2:04:32] where is your brother
[2:04:34] where are you at
[2:04:38] why are you remaining in this low place
[2:04:44] why can't you
[2:04:46] let go of your bitterness
[2:04:49] why can't you rise above
[2:04:52] the place that you've been see god
[2:04:55] i don't want him to have to come to me
[2:04:57] the way that he did to adam
[2:05:00] i want him to be able to guide me with
[2:05:02] his eye i want to be able to be so aware
[2:05:06] of his sweet spirit that i
[2:05:08] if i do
[2:05:10] get myself in trouble
[2:05:13] that i immediately
[2:05:15] repent
[2:05:19] while the musicians come i'm just going
[2:05:20] to throw this in here
[2:05:28] we have talked in time past
[2:05:36] about the seven spirits of god
[2:05:42] isaiah chapter 11
[2:05:45] verse 1 and 2 this was not in my notes
[2:05:48] but i'd like to read it into the record
[2:05:51] isaiah
[2:05:54] chapter 11
[2:05:56] verse 1 and 2.
[2:06:00] and there shall come forth a rod out of
[2:06:02] the stem of jesse
[2:06:04] and a branch shall grow out of his roots
[2:06:08] the spirit of the lord shall rest upon
[2:06:10] him
[2:06:12] the spirit of wisdom and understanding
[2:06:14] the spirit of counsel and might
[2:06:17] the spirit of knowledge and of the fear
[2:06:20] of the lord the seven spirits of god
[2:06:23] we would talk here about
[2:06:26] what i want to dwell on is the last
[2:06:28] phrase there the fear of the lord
[2:06:34] the fear of the lord
[2:06:42] many many times
[2:06:46] i can hear brother branham preaching and
[2:06:49] he would say what are you so afraid of
[2:06:54] why are you so afraid
[2:06:58] but he wasn't talking about being afraid
[2:07:00] of the lord
[2:07:02] he's talking about being afraid of
[2:07:04] everything around you afraid of cancer
[2:07:06] afraid of the dark afraid of this afraid
[2:07:08] of that
[2:07:09] he wanted us to have a reverential fear
[2:07:13] of the lord
[2:07:15] and
[2:07:18] there is coming
[2:07:20] a reverential fear or awe of the lord
[2:07:24] that is going to come among us
[2:07:28] and god is dealing with all of these
[2:07:30] issues in our life the the the mind
[2:07:32] battle
[2:07:34] the issues of the mind the brain
[2:07:36] how that god has given us these tools to
[2:07:38] bring every thought into
[2:07:42] captivity
[2:07:43] to the word of god and
[2:07:45] we have
[2:07:47] continued to allow
[2:07:49] the enemy to run over top of us
[2:07:51] we have not utilized the tools that god
[2:07:54] has given us we have not uh
[2:07:57] we haven't
[2:07:59] mastered that and and i have no stones
[2:08:01] to throw i i put myself in this crowd
[2:08:04] with you
[2:08:05] we have we have not mastered this
[2:08:08] and
[2:08:10] we continue to battle from day to day
[2:08:14] and when things are said
[2:08:17] because we have let our thoughts run
[2:08:19] rampant
[2:08:21] we
[2:08:22] sometimes resent
[2:08:25] what is said
[2:08:30] we resent these things
[2:08:34] and
[2:08:37] god gives a space of ignorance
[2:08:45] but he's going to deal with them
[2:08:49] he's going to deal with every issue of
[2:08:51] our life
[2:08:54] and we're going to walk in irreverence
[2:08:56] and reverential awe of the lord
[2:09:01] to
[2:09:02] where that he can come to us
[2:09:07] and we bow ourself
[2:09:09] before him
[2:09:12] rather than offering excuses
[2:09:16] to the lord
[2:09:17] like adam did
[2:09:19] like eve did
[2:09:21] like cain did
[2:09:23] but we come with a holy reverence before
[2:09:25] god and say
[2:09:27] i
[2:09:29] release everything that i am holding on
[2:09:32] to
[2:09:32] but these resentments
[2:09:37] now perhaps
[2:09:40] they were so close
[2:09:44] to being formed
[2:09:46] so close to the original creation
[2:09:50] that when god came and asked them this
[2:09:53] question
[2:09:54] that they were able to survive
[2:10:00] but as humanity
[2:10:02] has
[2:10:04] come farther and farther away
[2:10:07] from the original creation and she
[2:10:11] uh eats
[2:10:12] stuff that's not good for her and
[2:10:15] her body is broken down and
[2:10:17] our hearts are weaker than they used to
[2:10:19] be and our our
[2:10:21] everything about us is weaker than it
[2:10:23] used to be
[2:10:24] but the fear of the lord is going to be
[2:10:27] among us
[2:10:29] and god is dealing piece by piece with
[2:10:32] us and he's coming to you asking
[2:10:34] questions of you
[2:10:36] not because he's coming as the accuser
[2:10:39] but because he is desiring for you to
[2:10:42] get everything
[2:10:44] under the blood of jesus christ every
[2:10:46] bit of it he's desiring for me to be
[2:10:49] under the blood of jesus christ
[2:10:52] but when the fear of god comes among us
[2:10:54] when god lets that come in its fuller
[2:10:57] measure and we throw up a resentment
[2:11:02] to the word of god
[2:11:05] the bible tells us that men's hearts are
[2:11:07] failing for fear
[2:11:11] and it's not just going to be out there
[2:11:15] is that what ananias will look like i
[2:11:17] don't know
[2:11:22] because i'm just telling you i don't
[2:11:25] want to have to ever be one to pronounce
[2:11:27] judgment on somebody
[2:11:37] but when the holy ghost comes among us
[2:11:41] in such heavy doses
[2:11:44] as he has promised to in the end time
[2:11:47] and we continue to throw up our excuses
[2:11:50] before the lord and we throw up our
[2:11:53] excuses to the lord
[2:11:57] i don't know what will happen
[2:12:02] does that mean you lose your salvation
[2:12:04] i'm not going there
[2:12:07] but what i would say friends
[2:12:10] is god is encouraging us
[2:12:13] to have everything
[2:12:16] brother shelley says so often all the
[2:12:18] dead cats off the line
[2:12:23] all the dead cats off the line
[2:12:27] you know when
[2:12:29] i was growing up
[2:12:31] play something to help me shut up please
[2:12:35] when i was a child
[2:12:37] my neighbor had an electric fence
[2:12:40] keep the cows in
[2:12:45] it was two strands
[2:12:47] of smooth
[2:12:49] electric wire galvanized electric wire
[2:12:54] as a child i helped to dig holes to put
[2:12:56] the posts in
[2:12:58] i tried to drive the nails
[2:13:00] through the insulators
[2:13:04] but when he got done installing that
[2:13:06] fence the object was that if the cow
[2:13:08] would come up and touch that wire
[2:13:11] he'd get shocked
[2:13:14] and it helped to keep him inside the
[2:13:16] fence
[2:13:19] now i was there more than once when
[2:13:22] mr davis would take a young calf that he
[2:13:24] wanted to put out to pasture
[2:13:27] and put a rope around that calf and he'd
[2:13:30] take that calf up to that fence and put
[2:13:32] his nose his wet slobbery nose
[2:13:35] to that electric fence
[2:13:38] because he was trying to teach that calf
[2:13:41] you don't want to press against that
[2:13:43] wire
[2:13:45] there is a boundary for you to stay
[2:13:47] inside of
[2:13:50] and this electric wire is around this
[2:13:52] boundary
[2:13:54] now what i found out as i was growing up
[2:13:58] was that my neighbor
[2:14:01] would go around and he
[2:14:04] this is
[2:14:05] years ago he didn't have a string
[2:14:06] trimmer you know the gas string trimmer
[2:14:09] he had a pair of shears
[2:14:12] and he would go along that fence and if
[2:14:14] any grass was growing up too high
[2:14:17] anything that would cause that wire to
[2:14:18] be grounded
[2:14:20] [Music]
[2:14:22] he would cut it down because he wanted
[2:14:24] the voltage to go through that wire as
[2:14:26] strongly as possible to keep that cow
[2:14:28] inside of that wire
[2:14:34] many many times there is a voltage
[2:14:36] between us and the holy spirit there is
[2:14:38] a there is a current we'll say there is
[2:14:41] a current
[2:14:42] between us and the holy spirit
[2:14:45] and we allow some things to grow up
[2:14:49] in our lives
[2:14:52] that are grounding that current
[2:14:55] they're slowing the current down they're
[2:14:57] causing that current to become less
[2:15:00] and less and less and that's when we
[2:15:02] find ourselves in the traps
[2:15:05] of the enemy because we have become
[2:15:08] grounded
[2:15:10] we have allowed things to ground us till
[2:15:13] that the current is not strong as it
[2:15:15] used to be
[2:15:17] so i would encourage us as a body of
[2:15:19] believers to let the holy spirit come
[2:15:21] with his shears today
[2:15:23] and shear all of that stuff that is
[2:15:25] causing us to be grounded
[2:15:28] and let the current get back strong
[2:15:30] again would you stand to your feet
[2:15:33] the things of earth will grow
[2:15:38] strangely dim
[2:15:41] in the light
[2:15:44] of his glory
[2:15:49] sing again
[2:15:51] oh
[2:15:55] turn your
[2:15:57] eyes upon
[2:16:00] [Music]
[2:16:10] full face
[2:16:15] and the things
[2:16:18] of earth
[2:16:20] will grow strangely
[2:16:23] [Music]
[2:16:32] perhaps you have something you want to
[2:16:34] talk to the lord about and you'd come
[2:16:35] and join us around the front here today
[2:16:38] turn
[2:16:40] your
[2:16:41] eyes upon
[2:16:46] [Music]
[2:16:49] look for all in his
[2:16:52] wonder
[2:16:54] full face
[2:16:59] and the
[2:17:02] things of earth
[2:17:05] will
[2:17:05] grow strangely
[2:17:09] dim
[2:17:10] in the light
[2:17:18] now remember any time the holy spirit
[2:17:20] draws you it's not because he wants to
[2:17:22] make you feel like slop
[2:17:25] it is because he wants to repair it
[2:17:27] he wants to take care of it
[2:17:30] get us back to full current once again
[2:17:33] so let's pray together wherever you are
[2:17:35] you pray in your own language your own
[2:17:37] words
[2:17:39] you know what you're dealing with
[2:17:41] you talk to the lord about it
[2:17:44] lord as these have gathered around the
[2:17:45] front of this building today
[2:17:48] perhaps there are those on the stream
[2:17:50] that wish they could come and gather
[2:17:52] with us
[2:17:54] we just come
[2:17:55] in the lovely name of the lord jesus
[2:17:58] christ
[2:17:59] god we know we can't fix ourselves
[2:18:03] we don't have the ability
[2:18:06] but we come
[2:18:07] putting ourselves on your mercy
[2:18:10] and ask you lord
[2:18:12] that you will go deep into
[2:18:14] our minds our hearts
[2:18:18] our soul
[2:18:20] you find those things lord
[2:18:23] that we throw up
[2:18:25] and resent truth when it comes our way
[2:18:28] you know how to put your finger on it
[2:18:31] lord
[2:18:32] [Music]
[2:18:34] those things that we allow to stay in
[2:18:36] our lives
[2:18:38] that cuts down on the holy ghost current
[2:18:42] lord i'm asking you
[2:18:45] cleanse me o god
[2:18:47] cleanse me of it
[2:18:50] [Music]
