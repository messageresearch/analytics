========================================

Description:
Pastor Shelley explores how God allows believers to experience seasons of misunderstanding as part of divine purification. Using the metaphor of Roman tinted glass vessels that distort wine’s appearance during fermentation, he explains how others’ perceptions may be inaccurate while God refines character. The message emphasizes finding identity in God’s approval rather than human validation, maintaining integrity during criticism, and understanding that misunderstanding often precedes promotion in God’s kingdom.

He is so so so very good. You may be seated just a moment. If you are streaming the service this morning, we would so very much like I I think I'll ask just a few a few weeks maybe now in a row. We would so very much like to know uh where you're from and where you're streaming from. We have so many people who would rather remain anonymous and we understand that. Thank you. Is that did that do it? We understand that. But if you are uh in a position where you can uh let us know, well, we would just very much like to know where you are. And uh we're getting such great great reports from so many places. if you are if you're doing it on the app or if you greet us on the app, as soon as the service is over, that's gone and we can't see it. And I'm I don't generally look at it too often during the service. But uh I just wanted to let you know that. But everyone who is streaming now, we just greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. We want to go to the Lord in prayer for just a moment. Uh, how many of you have an unspoken need in the house? God sees your need. Would you continue to remember Sister Evelyn Fox to the Lord? Would you remember Jessica to the Lord this morning? She is not feeling well at all. Quite sick, they say. Uh, Brother David man is recovering. And, uh, I wasn't expecting to see him this morning, but I'm really glad to see him. Let's believe that the Lord will accelerate his healing. Amen. And uh brother Jerry was not able. He wanted to be here today, but he posted in the app that he wasn't able to be here physically. And we understand that, but we're asking the Lord to be with him. Would you remember brother Liam? Uh he is uh home in New Mexico and uh of course desires our prayers for final and great further I should say further leadership in his life. The Lord knows he has everything in his great big capable hands and Jason is traveling uh this weekend and so we want to lift him up to the Lord in prayer. Sister Kathy has experienced a great loss to her and to her son Elmer and uh a companion. I was reading early this morning where brother Brandham was talking about uh Prince his horse and he was talking about Fritz his dog and how that uh in that experience with the Lord he saw he said I knew I would see Prince uh and he saw him and he saw his dog his hunting dog uh Fritz and as the vision was coming to an end and the Lord just spoke out and and hold him. Everything you've ever loved will be there. I don't know how God pulls that off. I don't know how he does it. I don't know how that is even possible, but I'm going to I'm going to count on it. &gt;&gt; I'm going to count on it. So, would you pray for Sister Kathy and Bo and her son Elmer and uh that the Lord would just continue to to strengthen them and comfort them. She has lost a significant part of her life. And and what makes it so special is uh you know the these animals that we get in our life, they love us in our good times and our bad times. If we're ill and we raise our voice, they just forgive us. All it takes is a another bowl of food or treat. They just forgive us so quickly. They don't hold grudges. And we can tell them our secrets. They don't ever tell anybody. We can tell them how rough it is and sometimes they become uh like family to us. So, she didn't ask me to mention it and may may have wished that I didn't, but I thought it was uh enough. I I uh I had a couple times of meeting this special u member of her family so to speak and uh I know that uh he was indeed special to her and he was indeed special. So ask the Lord to bring comfort and and help them to move forward. Um loss is loss. It's just kind of hard to push through sometime. This Thursday is Sister Judith's birthday and she is not with us. She is in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, taking care of her precious parents, Brother and Sister Wgner. And we want to send love to her. Um I'm hoping to remember on Thursday again, but uh I have it wrote down today, so I know I know if I read it, I'll remember. And we want to say to her how much we appreciate her prayers. There's one thing I know that no matter where she is in the world, she's praying for my family. &gt;&gt; That means a awful lot. How many of you know that? &gt;&gt; To know there's someone always lifting up you and your family to the Lord, it means a lot. It means a lot. This week Joshua had a a run in with a with a grinder, and it could have been much more severe than it was. It was the dull blade. Thank the Lord. And not the new sharp one that was going on it. And we're very, very thankful for that. But it's still a call you don't really want to get. But God has been good. He got stitches. He continued to work. And uh it's healing quite well. And there's just a little bit of, you know, how it is. It takes a while for things to go back together and feel good again. But it's in moments like that that you can really appreciate the prayers you get &gt;&gt; and the faithful prayers. Amen. Thursday is also brother Greg and and sister Samantha's anniversary and we s certainly have missed them. I we haven't seen them now in quite a while but we send our love to them the same and we uh wish them a very happy wedding anniversary on Thursday. Fellowship meetings are coming up soon. Saturday, August the 2nd and third. Let's see what the Lord will do. &gt;&gt; Amen. How many of you know he's more than able &gt;&gt; to supply every one of our needs? David, is is that too personal? Would you share it? Uh there is like a real hollow sound in my in my monitor. It sounds like I'm almost dropped in. I don't know if it sounds that way out there, but it's not it doesn't sound nice up here. I I know you're you weren't prepared. What? come and get this mic here. And if it's too personal, just leave out the dirty details, but but share your testimony, would you? You can stand. I'll move and you can stand over here if you want to. Um I uh Brother Shelley preached I think two Sundays ago about tithing and I realized I was doing it wrong. not for any personal reasons, just didn't know better. And so Ashley and I were both convicted separately. And when we got home, she said, "Did you hear that?" I said, "Yes." So she said, "We need to make it right what we can." And so immediately we paid it the right way that day. And then the next day I get home, she said, "I have something to show you." And there was a check in the mail for $500. It was 468 I believe that we were not expecting just from the department of Georgia the revenue and we were like wow that is God and it was in the mail &gt;&gt; because we were on vacation it already came in the mail it was sitting in the mailbox and so then we're like wow that is God and I had told some of the brothers I wanted to share it on Tuesday but um I it just it just I just didn't and and I shared them with him in the back. And then uh on Friday, I was like, you know, I haven't paid tithe on my garden. I wanted to pay tithe on my garden. And so I did that. And then I believe it was maybe Monday or Tuesday the next week, we get a letter in the mail saying that Ashley had a check that she hadn't cashed from 2024, March of 2024. and like you just fill this out, send it in, and we'll send you the money. And I just want to thank God for that, I believe immediately. And that check that that mail was sent July 3rd before we even made a change. And I believe my garden is doing better. We've been getting like bowls and bowls of tomatoes every day. And so I just want to thank the Lord for providing and being faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That's good. [Applause] That's good. God is faithful. You know, sometimes we never get to hear uh when someone takes something serious on their heart and begins to do it. I know there are critics. I know there are people who'd say, "Well, you know, you really can't give God glory." Well, yeah, I would give him glory. Anytime a check arrives at my house or my or the church here, I'm giving him glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God sees you. You We've got to remember he saw ahead. &gt;&gt; And uh I wonder what is heading your way. What's coming your way? Well, praise the Lord for it now. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord for it in advance. &gt;&gt; And let's see what he'll do. Would you give thanks to God for these musicians? [Applause] Let's stand. And I would just tell you, I'm not 100% this morning. Much better. I'm not 100% this morning, but he is &gt;&gt; more than enough. &gt;&gt; More than enough. And it never crossed my mind not to be standing here. Never crossed my mind. I knew I had to be here. Whether I was propped up or sitting or standing or or or or running out for a minute and coming back, I I knew that this is where I'm supposed to be. And uh he gives us strength, doesn't he? &gt;&gt; All the way. Uh would you turn in your Bible this morning to Jeremiah? I guess you knew that, didn't you? Chapter 48 and verse 11. because there are so many people that are joining us about a third of the way into this series. So, I want to make sure that we catch them up at least with our original text. This is the prophet Jeremiah and he is prophesying concerning the really the rebellion of Moab and what is to come. He is reminding them that just because you haven't had some difficult time doesn't mean there it's not on the way. It's on the way. He said and it's going to be for your own good. Now all things that happen to us are not good but all things that happen to us happen &gt;&gt; for our good. Do you really believe that &gt;&gt; Moab hath been at ease from his youth? And he hath settled on his leaves, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity. Therefore, his taste remained in him and his scent is not changed. This scripture is telling us that the dregs, the leaves of the wine has remained in the wine and it has greatly affected the flavor and the fragrance of the wine. I want you to turn to Psalm 66. for today's text verses 10- 12. We are getting ready to introduce the nitty-gritty of the vessel of misunderstanding. The psalmist said in verse 10, "For thou, oh God, hast proved us. Thou hast tried us as say it. Silver is tried. You've proved us. Let's go back. You proved us. You've tried us even as silver is tried. How many of you know how silver is tried? &gt;&gt; With extreme heat. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not in comfort, but in discomfort. Thou broughtest us into the net. Thou ladest affliction upon our loins. Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads. We went through fire and water. We went through fire and through water, but thou brought us, thou broughtest us out into a &gt;&gt; wealthy place. Let's look at it in the amplified. For you, oh God, have proved us. You have tried us as silver is tried, refined and purified. You brought us into the net, the prison, the fortress, the dungeon. It could have been any of those places in your life. You laid a heavy burden upon our loins. You caused men to ride over our heads while we were prostrate. We went through fire and through water, but you brought us out into a broad and that word broad is the is the best translation of that Hebrew word. You have brought us into a broad moist place. I know some people don't like the word but it requires moisture &gt;&gt; for the germination of life. So the psalmist is saying, Lord, because of you, you've brought us into a wide, broad, productive place &gt;&gt; to abundance and refreshment and open air, wealthy places, valuable places, places of abundance. &gt;&gt; But not until we were tried like silver in the fire. Father, thank you that you are a good good papa to us. &gt;&gt; You know what we need when we need it. You rescue us from the pit. &gt;&gt; Your hand reaches farther down than we can reach up. &gt;&gt; You are both savior, healer, deliverer, sanctifier, holy ghost baptizer, and so much more to us. But Lord, you you know how to work in us to purify and refine us. Sometimes it takes fire. Sometimes it takes misunderstanding. Whatever it takes, Lord, we trust you. &gt;&gt; We trust you. The Lord gives. The Lord takes away. The Lord provides. The Lord withholds. &gt;&gt; It's just him. But Lord, we thank you that you are faithful in all of your ways. And we remember that the righteous are never forsaken. &gt;&gt; We always have you and we have your provision. Help us in this service today. Strengthen each person who struggles in their body for the glory of God. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, Yeshua, our Messiah, we pray. And the saints said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Be seated. Do your work. do your part. Would you do that? &gt;&gt; Uh, we know that in ancient times, vessels for fermentation were normally made out of earthn vessels or what we might call clay vessels. I showed you the pictures of the amphora, the the the particularly shaped earthn jars that wine was most often kept in. I also showed you, thank you. There's a great reminder and you can go into caves right now in Israel, uh, solid rock caves and find ledges that have been carved out of the side of the cave with with holes, oh, about that deep. Perfectly round holes about that deep. Put those pictures back up if you will. Did you notice how they're shaped on the bottom? The the uh angular uh I don't cone shape I guess you would say uh at the bottom of those vessels so that they can sit right down in those holes because wine was often left to ferment in a in a dark and cool environment. How many of you can understand that? And uh as the second picture that Charity was showing there again is there is a wine press inside the cave. And I'm sure that if we were able to see the entire uh surrounding that we would probably see those same impressions or uh round dugout places where those vessels would sit. We also showed you the the wine skins made from the skin of a goat or sometimes a sheep. And we talked about how they have to to be uh stretchable. They have to have an elasticity so that as the wine begins to ferment and expand, the skin goes with it. If it's too old, if it's gotten too dry and it looks like that, then it will burst. &gt;&gt; It can't hold the pressure. How many of you can say today, I can hold the pressure? Oh, I didn't get a lot of votes for that. It's a good thing we're not electing a president here. &gt;&gt; Uh, I didn't get a lot of votes for that. You can. Let me tell you something. God promised in his word that he would not put more on us, &gt;&gt; right, &gt;&gt; than we could possibly bear. I believe that. &gt;&gt; And so, I can handle it. &gt;&gt; I want to say today, with the help and the and the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, I can handle it. I've got to be wine in his cup. &gt;&gt; I've got to bring refreshment and honor to him. &gt;&gt; He's worthy of it all. &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you that the vessel of misunderstanding is neither an earthn vessel nor a vessel made of skin, but it's actually a vessel made of glass. There are those who would think, well, I can't imagine that in Bible times, and this was particularly in New Testament times, it was because of the spreading influence of the Romans, that Roman world was expanding daily, both in knowledge and in territory. And the Romans brought this amazing, beautiful colored glass to Israel. And it is found today in almost every archaeological dig in the nation. And because it has been underneath the pressure of the earth all these years and layers of dirt and the pressure and the weight has sort of taken that broken glass and created something entirely different. I don't have any in my office or I would have brought it out and showed you. But uh someone gave me a beautiful set of of cufflinks that have as the stone uh what we call Roman glass, but it's it's you wouldn't know it was glass because it is multicolored. It almost looks like a a more vibrant version of the mother of pearl. You know what that looks like with the little rainbow colors in it. And this glass was being used in Israel in the time of the New Testament. In fact, about a hundred years before New Testament times. Uh this was not clear glass. This was tinted glass or colored glass. And this glass vessel was particularly used when wine was being made in smaller batches for families of great importance and great wealth. This was especially true in royal families. &gt;&gt; So I want you to know that you are special wine. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are from a very uh wealthy well-known royal family. &gt;&gt; How many of you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, my my father, my creator I is uh over it all. &gt;&gt; And and the and the Messiah called me his elder brother. I mean his brother. He is our elder brother. &gt;&gt; And so we're thankful to be part of that family. It's the royal seed of Abraham. &gt;&gt; I have royal blood running through my veins. &gt;&gt; So, I'm not just anybody's uh box wine. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. I'm being prepared for a family uh that is of great importance. &gt;&gt; Amen. The family of God. I'm part of that family of God. So, uh you wouldn't find glass fermenting uh vessels in in most common homes, but you would uh find it in New Testament times in homes where there is prestige. While the Romans may have used clear glass for serving wine, pouring wine out, the glass that was used for fermentation would have been tinted glass and different tints and colors were added to the glass to aid in continuing the fermentation process. Roman glass makers were skilled in creating a range of vibrant colors by adding metal oxides to the to the sand crystals as the glass was being heated. For example, iron being added to the glass would make it green in color. And if you added manganesees, you would get purple hues out of the glass. Other common colors would have been blue, brown, yellow, and even something that is referred to as dicroic glass, which appears to change color depending on how the light hits it. It It's almost crystalallike in nature. As the wine is emptied into this tinted glass vessel, its deep dark red color would then assume the hue that is created by that particular shade and color of the glass when viewed through the vessel. If you're looking through tinted glass, they they talk about there's an expression that says he sees the world through rose tinted glasses. Everything looks rosy to him whether it's rosy or not. You ever known anybody like that? Well, I haven't known near enough people like that. &gt;&gt; I'd like to know some more people like that. I I have spent most of my sojourn with those who see the glass half empty. &gt;&gt; Wouldn't you like to live with somebody, worship with somebody who could see it always &gt;&gt; full? half full on its way to being full. &gt;&gt; So the tenting of the glass would change the outward observation of the wine that was inside. So you'd never be able to know when the wine was perfectly ready by looking through the tinted color glass. In fact, we found out that as the as the wine would take on the hue of the particular color of the glass when viewed through the vessel, for instance, here's an example. If you pour that deep red wine into a green vessel, green glass vessel, it would cause the wine to lose its vibrant deep red color and it would turn it darker, muddier redish, reddish with hints of brown. It would more or less look muddy. You wouldn't want to uh to you know choose wine by that kind of an image that you were getting from the outside. That's why we call it the vessel of misunderstanding. You can't look from the outside. &gt;&gt; You see you see Jesse you you you see Jesse man looks on the outward appearance. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; But God sees the heart. You brought your champion sons down here &gt;&gt; a &gt;&gt; and they all look indeed uh well enough, strong enough, smart enough, courageous enough to fill the responsibility of the king. &gt;&gt; But I'm not finding what is necessary in any of these sons. &gt;&gt; Don't you have another son somewhere? &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; There's got to be another. Well, yes. I I I've got that I've got that boy, that youngest boy of mine. He's down there taking care of the sheep. &gt;&gt; And maybe one of the other brothers spoke up and said, "Yeah, we're on the battlefield. We're fighting for the defense of the nation, and all he's doing is is down there handling the sheep, and he's not always doing such a good job at that." Samuel the prophet just said, "Bring him to me." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Bring him here. I want to look at him. &gt;&gt; Because man looks on the outward shell. &gt;&gt; Man looks at the tinted glass. Man looks on the layer, the surface of what can be seen or perceived. But God sees beyond the badger skin, brother. God sees what's on the inside. And it is by that that he chooses us. It's by that that he anoints us. It's what he knows about our heart. &gt;&gt; You may seem to be the most religious of them all &gt;&gt; and the most spiritual of them all on the surface, but God's not looking at your performance only. He's looking at your heart. He alone has the right to judge our motives. One of the things the Lord dealt with me about a couple of weeks ago in prayer, he said, "I'm going to deal with hypocrisy in my church first. &gt;&gt; I'm going to deal with that first and foremost." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to seek out those who pretend to be one thing and live an entirely different thing. That's what I'm going to deal with first. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm depending on him. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. If there's any hypocrisy in my life, I want it dug out with a grubbing hole. &gt;&gt; I want it revealed to me so that I can do something about it. &gt;&gt; I'm not particularly excited about it being revealed to you, but I'm very excited about it being revealed to me &gt;&gt; because I'm the only one who can take it up with the creator. &gt;&gt; I'm the only one that can make up my mind. I cannot stress to you today the importance enough of having a determined mind, &gt;&gt; having a madeup mind to hold out, to hold on, to go all the way. &gt;&gt; And to be what you say you are. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's the life of Jesus Christ that we claim. &gt;&gt; We claim to be the very reflection of his light in the earth. May our lives begin to line up. &gt;&gt; You see, he sees those things you you try on in the dressing room. &gt;&gt; And he sees those things you hide in the back of the closet. &gt;&gt; And he sees those things you pull out on occasion to just make sure it still fits &gt;&gt; when you don't even need it. [Music] He even sees the dime bag. &gt;&gt; He sees the edibles. &gt;&gt; He knows exactly what's going on in our lives. &gt;&gt; And he's calling us to a place of integrity. &gt;&gt; I've spoken to my own children recently. I've spoken to my own family and I've spoken to anyone else that I had an opportunity to speak to. Integrity is everything. &gt;&gt; It's everything. It's so much a part of our character in Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That means we've got to say what we mean &gt;&gt; and mean what we say. It means we can't expect somebody to read between the lines and figure it out on their own and come away with the right conclusion. &gt;&gt; If there's something we need to tell them, we ought to tell them. &gt;&gt; If there's something they don't need to know, &gt;&gt; this is not a time for triangulation. No, &gt;&gt; this is not a time for drawing other people in &gt;&gt; to our our beef, to our disagreement with someone, &gt;&gt; to our opinion with someone. &gt;&gt; This is a in fact, this is the hour that we should I as brothers and sisters desire to to somehow cover. I don't mean cover sin, but I mean to to sort of act as a protection &gt;&gt; so that everybody doesn't have to know. &gt;&gt; Come on, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What if a hand would appear uh this morning and write on the wall over there between those windows? What if the hand of God were to write there today? Your soul is being weighed in the balance &gt;&gt; and found wanting. &gt;&gt; It's not enough. It's not measuring up. Would you want God then to continue to write your sin on the wall there for everyone to read? &gt;&gt; Or would you rather take that as a warning from the Lord and go clean up your life? Come on. &gt;&gt; It won't do any good to tell one another. It'll only do good when we tell Listen, you know that little aunt that I tell you about, my little preacher aunt, gr sweet sister Isa May, I always say I'll show you a picture of her and I never do, but her hair was as she was kind of short and her hair was as tall as she was, as sweet as she could be. She got the Holy Ghost in a corn crib. God really filled her. Of course, we know she was doing God a service without being in his perfect will. But she Listen, that was an hour where when God did something for you, you wanted to do everything you possibly could for him. &gt;&gt; And sometimes people got out of their calling because of a desire to do something for the Lord. I'm going to let him sort that out. I tell you what I don't believe. I don't believe these message Pharisees, &gt;&gt; who believe that God has no patience or no understanding for people who are doing God a service without his will. We all know that couldn't possibly be the truth. When brother Brandham looks at the woman in the prayer line and says, "I see you are a teacher of scripture. Go do what's in your heart." And some people say, "Well, that was a condemnation because he didn't tell her to obey the word. He told her to go do what was in her heart because he knew she was going to anyways. Not because she wanted to rebel, because that was what was in her heart to do to please the Lord. Be careful. &gt;&gt; I don't believe I don't believe I'm not looking for that in my life in this hour. But oh, I remember her and I remember how she sang those songs. I've told you before so many times and now I've done forgot it wasn't the song I usually mention and now I done forgot the song that I was going to Oh, you got to live your religion every &gt;&gt; day. Every day. Every day. Every day. &gt;&gt; If I falter while I'm trying, don't be angry. Let me stay. Lord, I'd be willing to run. If God should point out to you your slapness, &gt;&gt; you wouldn't want somebody else to go spread it all around the house. &gt;&gt; And I know now what I was going to say. There was a portion in one of those two songs that said, "If you see me fail," I don't remember if the word was fail or falter or fall or whatever, but it was along that line. She said, "If if if my brother and sister you be, go and don't tell another, tell Jesus on me." Wouldn't you like to think that somebody would go and tell the Lord &gt;&gt; instead of telling somebody else &gt;&gt; that's powerless to help, &gt;&gt; powerless to change the situation? I'm preaching. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's too true. And so I've said to my own children, uh, don't don't overtell it. Don't exaggerate it. If you're going to say something, say the truth, the whole truth. Nothing but the truth. &gt;&gt; Am I going to have to start swearing in my family? Is somebody going to have to start swearing you in because we can't trust you to have the integrity not to tell it just like it is? Come on. &gt;&gt; Maybe find a way of slanting it a little bit so that you look better in the situation. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus have mercy, folks. The problem with that kind of busy bodiness is it keeps us out of the altar. It keeps us It busies our minds so that we can't see our need. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you that devil will try to turn families on one another. It'll try to destroy relationships &gt;&gt; while somebody uh viciously tries to paint themselves the hero. &gt;&gt; You just let God I'll tell you uh maybe you need to go back to the vessel of misunderstanding. Maybe you need and I need to get a good dose of what it's like to be doing what we know to do and having it all to be misread. You can tell me. You can let me know when I'm out of the word here. &gt;&gt; Misjudged &gt;&gt; because somebody sees us through the tent of the glass &gt;&gt; instead of for who? Aren't you glad you've got a papa who sees you for who you really are? &gt;&gt; Hey, he knows you're imperfect. &gt;&gt; He knows I fall short. He loves me anyway. He pours me from one vessel to the next to get a little more of junk and gunk and leaves and out of me &gt;&gt; because one day he wants to put me in the crystal shalice. &gt;&gt; Show everybody my color. &gt;&gt; Show everybody how I taste. Show everybody how I smell. That's where we're headed. &gt;&gt; Anybody here? the green tint of the glass would filter out some of the red light, causing the wine to look less vibrant and more subdued. So, the wine itself was not clearly visible while in this vessel of misunderstanding. The tinted glass distorted the actual color and the brightness and the true value of the wine that was being perfected. So this vessel of misunderstanding gives an offolor impression to observers. The intentional use of this darkly colored glass was to limit the penetration of light into the wine because wine will more perfectly ferment in the darkness, &gt;&gt; in the aloneeness. in the darkness of the vessel of misunderstanding. If it were clear glass, the light would penetrate the glass and it would slow down and and perhaps stop the fermentation process. If the yeast dies, then the fermentation process is over. Anybody following me? &gt;&gt; So, let's talk about the season of the vessel of misunderstanding. Uh, it's a season where God allows you to be misread. It's a season where God allows you to be misrepresented. It's a season where he doesn't always jump to your defense. &gt;&gt; How many of you know he can defend us whenever he's ready to? &gt;&gt; Whenever God wants to defend you, he can move heaven and earth to say, "Wait a minute. Get your mouth off of that one. That one's mine." But he doesn't always move that quickly when we're in the vessel of misunderstanding &gt;&gt; because he wants us to hang in the hall of critics &gt;&gt; so that one day we can hang in the hall of fame. &gt;&gt; Anybody with me? &gt;&gt; Brother Vanam said every masterpiece must hang first in the hall of critics. &gt;&gt; I was preaching one time in Beckley, West Virginia. I recently showed Benjamin the advertisement for that meeting. I found it when going through memorabilia for my museum. I'm kidding. But I do want to show you some of it on my 50th anniversary, but I found it. I don't know how I made it. Benjamin said, "Wow, Dad, you were in the top five then, not the top 10. I don't know how I made it to this great list of esteemed ministers here. I was a newbie, only been around the message for a few years and and yet was invited to speak this very special meeting and it was a it it was uh I was there two times, Easter meetings and also the annual camp meeting. And so the people had already experienced uh my style in the Easter meeting and and the pastor had invited me to come back. But on the on the night before he had royalty in the message to give his testimony of being with brother Brandham. And I'll just mention that it was a hunting uh a hunting story. And as he was sharing that testimony, he he stopped there toward the end and he began to to speak about all the newbies and the flashy Pentecostal anointed young men and how they would sit at the piano and grin and use their pinky to play and on and on and on. And he said, "Bring them all to the altar and make them feel good." and he said, "I've never heard of anybody uh being changed or or helped because they felt good." Well, the reality is is I'd rather feel good than feel bad. &gt;&gt; I don't know how deep the change is always, but it's good to feel the presence of the Lord. I wouldn't want to be where I couldn't &gt;&gt; wouldn't want to be where I couldn't feel his presence. Anyway, everybody in the room knew who he was talking about. I was on the second row. Everybody was punching me. Everybody was turning around and leaning up and petting me on the shoulder. It was very obvious. Oh, you know, did it bother me? Well, it was a little hard to endure, but I just kept remembering Tonight is his night. Tomorrow night is my night. It should have been a different order. No, I didn't use the pull pit to fight back. I didn't have to because there was a Well, I had a deacon with me and we all know that uh upon his own confession, he didn't have enough of the Holy Ghost at that time. I'm not talking about Brother West, by the way. And he, as I got my stuff and came out, everybody came to me, rushing to me. Brother Shelley, I wouldn't have sat through that. Brother Shelley, I can't believe you had to endure that. Brother Shelley, that was so unfair, brother. On and on and on and on. And I said very, very little. I I almost made it to the car and and the deacon who was with me, his wife, he stepped out and he said, "I just tell you right now, I'll knock him out. He said, "I've already told him I don't have enough of the Holy Ghost." And he was right. And he said, "I believe the Lord to forgive me if I just knock this block off right now." I said, "Brother, that wouldn't be good." He said, "Many your elder and you you might really hurt him. And let's just leave this to the Lord." And so God gave me a message. And I preached I mean, he gave me the message before I got there. And I preached on David and how that uh he wanted he had this desire to go out and fight the giant and how brother Brandham said, you know, he he had never proven and tried the the ecclesiastical vest &gt;&gt; of Saul's armor. &gt;&gt; All he knew is that God had been with him when he killed the bear. And God had been with him when he killed the lion. and God had been with him and and that was all he knew. He didn't know how to be uh elite. He didn't know how to be uh you know formal. He didn't know how to be ecclesiastical. All he knew is he had proven and tried that a rock in a sling was enough to bring the enemy down. &gt;&gt; And oh did God move. &gt;&gt; He moved. He moved in that service. The people began to scream out as God began to move over that service. It was a powerful meeting. And the next night, uh, another precious brother, uh, elite elite brother got up and it was his night and and I didn't know him all that well. And he said, "I want to start off by saying, I was here last night, greatly blessed." He give a little word about that. And I was here the night before. Everybody's holding their breath. And he said, "I would just like to say one thing." He said, "You can always tell." Brother Brandham said, "You can always tell which apple tree gives the best apples." Because he said, "All you have to do is look for all the chunks that have been thrown at that tree. They'll all be laying around the bottom." Well, I I was not a person who understood what chunks were, and I hadn't been around the message long enough to even know what Brother Ram was talking about, nor what this brother was talking about. And somebody saw the puzzled look on my face, and they leaned over and they said, "You know that you chuck a stick or a rock or you chuck a limb up in the top of that tree to knock down the the ripest, best looking apple at the top." Well, you you pick up the apple, but you leave the chunk that you've chucked up there or chuck. You you leave that around the bottom. So, if you see a bunch of look like misplaced rocks and limbs around a tree, you'll know that's some of the best apples in the orchard. And everybody's been throwing things at it &gt;&gt; to knock down the apples. &gt;&gt; You You've got to learn. You got to learn that being misunderstood is part of life. It's not just part of preachers life. &gt;&gt; It's part of a Christian life. &gt;&gt; But let me listen very carefully what I'm going to say now. But here's what you don't want to do. And I'm not I'm not trying to be like Elvis Presley, but here's what you don't want to do. You don't want to get all shook up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you get all shook up because somebody's misunderstood you, if you get all shook up because someone has misrepresented you to someone else, guess what happens? All that sediment. &gt;&gt; There it is. &gt;&gt; All those leaves, all those drags that have settled down to the bottom of that wine that will be left behind when the king pours it into another vessel. If you get all shook up &gt;&gt; because somebody looked at me wrong and somebody had something to say about me and I can't even defend myself and I don't know what I'm going to do. &gt;&gt; You get all shook up. You're just going to stir the drags up. You're just going to stir the rotten stuff up again. &gt;&gt; Be still, my brother. &gt;&gt; Be still, my sister. Yes. &gt;&gt; Hang quietly in the hall of critics &gt;&gt; because one day I believe it. I &gt;&gt; I felt my tongue get thick when I said it because I believe one day the master will come for you. &gt;&gt; A &gt;&gt; and when he knows that all of that other stuff, God allowed you to hang there. He allowed you to get the chunks thrown at you. He allowed you to be misunderstood. Not so you would come up with some kind of pseudo martyr complex &gt;&gt; and you'd sing everybody hates me and nobody loves me and I'll just sit around and eat some worms. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; he didn't let you hang in the hall of critics so you could feel sorry for yourself. He let us hang in the hall of critics so that we could depend on him &gt;&gt; and realize there's nothing good. &gt;&gt; Help me preach. &gt;&gt; There's nothing good in me. &gt;&gt; There's nothing good in you. &gt;&gt; If I highly esteem you, it's because Christ is living in you. It's him that I esteem. It's your yieldedness to him that I celebrate. But it is not your talent. It is not your gift. It is not your stellar personality that attracts us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's only the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; If there's anything good to say about you, it is he surrendered. &gt;&gt; She gave up. She quit stirring up the leaves and the drags. She let it all sh She let it all settle to the bottom so that when she was poured that final time, everything unlike him was left behind. &gt;&gt; This is a season where God allows. Somebody say allows. &gt;&gt; Allows. &gt;&gt; Could he stop them? Oh yes. Has he ever? He has. &gt;&gt; But that's only when he says enough is enough. &gt;&gt; We don't ever know when that day is coming. It's coming. In every situation that you're troubled over right now, that day is coming. Enough is enough. And God said, "No more. You'll deal with that devil no more. You'll deal with that thorn no more. You'll deal with that thing no more. It'll never harass you or torment you again. But until God says enough is enough, you'll be misunderstood, &gt;&gt; both directions. Somebody will celebrate you when they ought to be calling you out, &gt;&gt; and somebody will be calling you out when they ought to be celebrating you. It'll happen both ways. It's misunderstanding that works both ways. &gt;&gt; And I can just go ahead and tell you right now that if you think you're somebody, you've misunderstood your own self. &gt;&gt; If I think I'm somebody special, I've already misunderstood myself. It's only him. &gt;&gt; It's only his life. Somebody said, "You know, that just sounds nice, but do you really mean it? With everything that is within me, I mean it. I I'm tired of fluff. I'm tired of self-promotion. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of folks thinking they've got to have a title to serve the Lord &gt;&gt; or to work in ministry for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Random said, "If you love me, just call me brother. &gt;&gt; I don't need anything beyond that. I don't have to be referred to uh uh every time you call my name by title. Just call me brother, he said. And he said one of the finest things that you could ever say to one another, just God bless you &gt;&gt; and mean it from the from the bottom of who you are, I I would whether you deserve it or not, whether I deserve it or not, I would rather see God bless you than not bless you. Because sometimes he'll bless you right out of your in your uh uh independence. He'll bless you right out of your independence and right into a new fresh dependence on him. I've seen him do it that way, too. &gt;&gt; Amen. He'll allow you to be misread. He'll allow you to be misrepresent misrepresented. He'll allow you to be misunderstood. He'll allow you to be misjudged as long as you're hanging in the vessel of misunderstanding. But don't you forget it folks. This is a sacred season. This vessel of misunderstanding is a sacred season. You are being sifted not to be destroyed, &gt;&gt; but to be promoted. &gt;&gt; And if that is the case, you're going to need both praise and correction. &gt;&gt; You're going to need to be celebrated. And you're going to need for somebody to be able to look you in the eye and tell you that is not the way it is. &gt;&gt; You are just wrong. &gt;&gt; That is not the way it is. But most of the time because we wear this uh you know this great uh uh trophy we we love to think of ourselves as non-confrontational. What I find is a lot of people who celebrate their their strength of of being non-confrontational are just really compromisers. They don't speak up for truth. You can speak up for truth without being religious. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can speak up for truth with sincerity of heart &gt;&gt; and don't tell anybody to do anything that you aren't doing yourself &gt;&gt; when it comes to the things of the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Yeah, well, I know how to do it wrong. So, I've got lots of lots of advice to give to people." No, no, no, no, no. You've got to have relationship with somebody. &gt;&gt; My goodness. &gt;&gt; This is a sacred season where God is using this understanding to break and then crucify. &gt;&gt; If you think the breaking is all, if you think the crushing is all, hang on &gt;&gt; because it's a crucifixion. The apostle said, "I die daily." He's referring to a total crucifixion, a total annihilation of his own will, &gt;&gt; deeply surrendered. But you can't do that. I can't do that until I get out of my soul life. And yes, that's what I meant to say. Soul life, &gt;&gt; mind, will, and emotion. You were a spirit uh before you were a body. Before you had a body to live in, you were a spirit first. And the breath of almighty God made you a living soul. And that soul is where the mind and the will and the emotions of a man resides. And it is in the mind and the will and the emotions of a man or a woman where we find our biggest hang-ups. &gt;&gt; It's stinking thinking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a lack of want to. &gt;&gt; You got to have the want to. You got to have the go through. You've got to keep the faith with everything that's in you. You can't just turn around because you get to feeling down. If you're going to make it through, then you got to have the want to. Sing again. You've got to have the want to. You've got to have the go through. You've got to keep the faith with everything that's in you. You can't just turn around because you get to feeling down. If you want to make it through, then you got to have the &gt;&gt; want to. &gt;&gt; How important is the want to? &gt;&gt; It's part of the thinking. And as a man thinkketh in his heart, &gt;&gt; so he is. &gt;&gt; I'm determined to be faithful. I'm determined to hold out to the end. &gt;&gt; I'm determined for Jesus to be my priority. &gt;&gt; He has to be. &gt;&gt; It has to be. Everything else that we love and cherish could be gone tomorrow. &gt;&gt; Ask Job. &gt;&gt; God forbid. But we could wake up in the morning to the news &gt;&gt; that there's nothing left but us and him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So quickly like a vapor. Don't you think that this daddy doesn't think about that when Joshua's driving so many miles back and forth to work? Don't you know that I think about the possibility of a call that would come shattering our life? Everything we cherish, everything we hold dear could be gone from us in a moment of time because life is just as a vapor appear on the glass and is quickly quickly it vanishes away. But holding on to Jesus is the best thing that anybody could ever do. And you don't know sometime you don't even realize sometime that he's all you need &gt;&gt; until he's all you have. Weather these storms, these little storms. Weather them like a soldier of the most high God. Stay with me. &gt;&gt; We're everyone battle scarred. We've everyone been through something. We've got to keep our eyes open so that we can see him. We continue to fill our lives with the things that add to our intellect perhaps but don't add to the spiritual part of who we are. Some of us are YouTube dummies. YouTube dummies. There are people so spiritually ignorant around this stuff that they'll they'll send you a a YouTube video that they hadn't even checked out real good for themselves. &gt;&gt; You better know what you pedal sir. &gt;&gt; You better know what you pass on. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Preach to us, brother. &gt;&gt; This season is a sacred season. It is not meant to punish you. It is meant to purify you. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's to break and crucify our ego. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "I didn't say eagle." I'm finding out that eagles have egos. &gt;&gt; Everybody does. Everybody has an ego. &gt;&gt; So, if you're using the word ego as though only some people have it, you're using the word and its meaning incorrectly. Everyone has an opinion of themselves, good, bad, or ugly. So, everybody in the room has an ego. It's not having an ego that's the problem. It's having an overinflated ego. It's having an ego that has been blown up with a bunch of hot air. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A man who's not happy unless his wife is uh, you know, shuffling around behind him all the time telling him how wonderful he is. That's right. &gt;&gt; No wonder we're becoming like bags of hot air with no real virtue or value. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we're finding people. We're drawing in. We're looking for people who will feed. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just a minute. Amen. &gt;&gt; You ought to have stomach pain more often because you can just I don't I don't have time to play this morning. I don't have time to fluff this morning. I didn't come here today because I felt like it. I came here today because I had a responsibility and an assignment. I cannot expect God to continue to be faithful to me if I can't be faithful to him. It's a covenant that we're in. My my part of the covenant is just as important as his part of the covenant. It's an agreement. If one of us breaks the covenant, the covenant is broken &gt;&gt; and has to be reinstituted &gt;&gt; by repentance. &gt;&gt; And repentance is not a a New Year's resolution or turning over a new leaf. &gt;&gt; Repentance is doing it about faith. &gt;&gt; It's a complete 180. &gt;&gt; Too many people have made it a complete 360. And when they're through repenting, they're moving in the same direction they were before they repented. &gt;&gt; It's only half a rotation, folks. &gt;&gt; It's an about face. &gt;&gt; Just turn right around and say, "By the help and the grace of God, I'm walking the other way." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those egos, uh, ego can be defined as a person's sense of self-importance. Everybody's got some some score of how important we think we are to God's economy. You'd be so surprised. You'd be so surprised. I have been surprised at how quickly God can take one down and put another up. &gt;&gt; And the world not not even miss a beat. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; My old granny used to say, "If if you die today, I got news for you. The sun will set tonight like it always has. And it'll come up in the morning like it always has. And there'll only be your yours. It'll only be yours. It'll only be those who you've had influence over their life that'll really even know you're gone. But the economy of God will just keep rocking on and he'll find somebody if anything was left undone. He knew that before he took you. And he will raise somebody up to finish the commission. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I feel sorry for people who who who are always looking for somebody else to be their Joshua. &gt;&gt; This crazy Facebook is full of it. Every every foreign brother in the world has got them a Facebook pull pit and they can say the craziest most outlandish antirist things that any you'd be surprised at how ignorant spiritually enlightened people can be. I found most of the time I just let it roll by. Most of the time I just let it roll right by. Don't you think that's the best idea? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I I want you to nod your little head in agreement. &gt;&gt; Don't you think that's usually the best idea? &gt;&gt; Just let it roll right by you like you didn't even know it was there. But on occasion, there will be something said that I just can't not. Yesterday was that day. I was I was sitting on the steps of the pool trying to relax and pray. I I mistakenly grabbed my phone to make sure that I wasn't being summoned. And uh boy, it was downhill from there. So, I found this. I'm going to read it to you. You don't you won't know who said it. I'll find it. I'm looking for the right once I find the Oh, there it is. It's a picture of Brother Joseph and a picture of Brother Brandham with a pillar of fire over his head and brother Joseph's pointing his finger and this brother has said, "Pastor, put Brother Brandham back in the pull pit. This day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears." Well, that I've heard them say that so many times until it doesn't even register with me as being it doesn't even make sense. I believe in the tapes. I believe in the tape. I believe in hearing the message. I read it. I hear it. I study it. I take it back like a Berean to the scripture, searching the scripture to make sure these things are so because brother Brandham commended the Bereans. And then you've got something like this. He who has seen the Lord Jesus Christ has seen God Almighty. He who has seen Prophet William Mary and Brandom has seen the Lord Jesus Christ. He who has seen prophet William Marryiam Brham has seen prophet Joseph Marian Brham. Hebrews 13:8. And it goes on, they go on to tell us how that uh although they have preached for years, there's no eighth messenger. And now they've made one. Now it's his son. This is my response. I'd like to get it on record for you. I'm so sorry for you dear precious and sincere brothers out among the nations of the world. Unfortunately, you have no idea of the sin and corruption happening in this press play and obey movement here in the United States. Folks, that was gracious. I could have spoke about all of the illegitimate babies being born in the Brandom family while they keep stressing press play. Come on. If brother Brandham could see the worldliness and compromise in so many in this headquarters sect, he would weep. If he could see how far so many have fallen away from the holiness and truth of the message he brought and have returned to paganism and idolatry, he would raise his voice against it. There is no biblical mandate or precedent for this. Brother Joseph is equal to or the successor of brother Brandham doctrine. It is anti-word as is brother Brandham as brother and as brother Brandham described this man worship in his time. You are now making them both Antichrist. &gt;&gt; We just had to make every sigh. Listen carefully. We just had to make every sigh, every partial sentence and every proud dad comment. Thus sayaith the Lord. In our enthusiasm, we just had to make everything he said equal to and on the same level with the Bible. Now many call it all the word, even his greetings, his opinions, and every personal comment. God help us all. We should have listened to him. We should have let him be a man. We should have diligently taken everything back to the word. We should have kept his absolute as our absolute. Now there's more confusion and even more ammunition for the critics. Our Joshua, this is why I read the whole thing in the first place. It's it it uh the the comment came out of my mind always looking for Joshua. Our Joshua is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He's leading us back to the Bible &gt;&gt; which we can now understand because God cared enough to send a messenger. I pray that somehow it is not too late for many to correct their past. I know you will now likely attack me, but I'm so used to it by now. I usually write and then delete and never post because it pains me to even say such things. It's the least of what they what they everyone looking for a chief apostle &gt;&gt; or an eighth messenger. &gt;&gt; And the reality is if you've received the baptism of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; he said our Holy Ghost is the Joshua. Our Joshua is the Holy Ghost. God restored the truth of his word and now the Holy Ghost leads us back to the absolute. &gt;&gt; It's the pattern of the scripture. That's right. &gt;&gt; Not a one-man resurrection tent meeting and an airplane ride across the country, &gt;&gt; but a many membered body &gt;&gt; who will stand with their messenger and become the final voice of God to the age. &gt;&gt; Not prophet Jr. &gt;&gt; But the final voice of God today. Somebody said, "We don't even know what you're talking about." I realize some of you don't, but you can't always live in a bubble. And if you don't hear this from time to time, you will not fully appreciate what God has done for us. &gt;&gt; If you don't have a clue of what I'm talking about, you can say, "Thank you, Lord, for putting me in a bubble. Thank God for putting me in a refuge &gt;&gt; where I don't have to deal with all of that. &gt;&gt; Spits and sputters and it all inspired. And folks, I'm telling you something. I don't have time for that very often. I'm too busy trying to get my own life in order with the one who called me &gt;&gt; so that I can be faithful to do what he told me I would do. Amen. &gt;&gt; To help get this bride ready to be out of here. &gt;&gt; Everything we need. The word is restored. The wedding garment is is prepared. We've just got to change clothes. &gt;&gt; But you can't put on the word. Listen, &gt;&gt; if you've got all this other stuff going on, &gt;&gt; if you are sitting here this morning and you think this is just another church like one down the road or across the hill there, you have absolutely missed the revelation. &gt;&gt; I don't even know. I I'm thankful you're here, but I don't even know why you are here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't know. I wouldn't be able to understand. I assume you're here because you've recognized that there's a commission and a mandate. It doesn't make us more special than anybody else. &gt;&gt; But every called person has a special unique commission. &gt;&gt; You do. I do. That's why we say special. Not because you're more special than someone else, but simply because you weren't called to just go with the flow. I'm going to tell you something. My toenail, no part of who I am is satisfied with going with the flow. &gt;&gt; I just can't do it. I've tried to do it. I can't do it. That ecclesiastical vest will not fit me. I cannot wear it. I want to get out of here. and I want you to get out of here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, everybody has a sense of self-importance which often leads to an inflated view of one's own abilities and a tendency to be self-centered or arrogant. Ego is often associated with negative traits like arrogance, narcissism, and a need to feel superior. my revel. I understand more than you understand. So you listen to me. No, you take it back to the word for yourself. &gt;&gt; This is not this is not one of those needs to feel superior. Don't you let that get in you. You don't have to be super dad. Just be a godly dad. &gt;&gt; You don't have to be a super mom. &gt;&gt; Just be a godly mom. You don't have to always get it right. &gt;&gt; Just understand it's not your rightness, it's his uprightness. &gt;&gt; But we have to have a madeup mind. &gt;&gt; And we can't drop our babies. &gt;&gt; We cannot drop our babies. &gt;&gt; We cannot feel good about ourselves if we are crippling the next generation. If we're teaching them, it doesn't matter &gt;&gt; whether or not you come to church. &gt;&gt; If we're teaching them, it doesn't matter whether you're on time. &gt;&gt; If we're teaching them, it doesn't matter how much attention you pay to the pastor. &gt;&gt; If we're teaching them your physical posture in church, doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; If we're teaching them this is a place to trim your fingernails, [Music] We are crippling the next generation &gt;&gt; and what we barely celebrate they will absolutely ignore. &gt;&gt; Ego is often associated with these negative I won't read it again. I don't think I can. For example, a person with a big ego might constantly boast about their superior knowledge or their grasp of a particular subject or their personal achievements. &gt;&gt; This is usually accomplished by belittling. &gt;&gt; That means to make somebody else feel little. badgering, which is almost like just constantly punching somebody. Just just thinking that your brother or sister is the is the is the devil that you're booing and just constantly nagging. Just so you'll know, a nagging is not a gender specific &gt;&gt; behavior. Amen. &gt;&gt; All of us are capable of nagging. &gt;&gt; Although the Bible does speak of a brawling woman and it doesn't speak perhaps of a brawling man, but that don't mean a man can't brawl. &gt;&gt; You just get a couple beers in here. You'll see how you can brawl. &gt;&gt; You get them higher than a kite and see how you brawl. Hello. This is usually accomplished by beliting, belittling, badgering, or bullying. Let me tell you something. The church is full of bullies. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The church is full of bullies. &gt;&gt; Don't you just want to say to every one of them, "You've met your match." &gt;&gt; Isn't that what you wanted to do in school? How many of you longed for the courage to just look at him and say, "I ain't going anywhere. You knock me down, I'll get up. &gt;&gt; You're not going to force me in or force me out. &gt;&gt; I have just as much right to be here as you do. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; There's only one way to deal with a bully, and that's stand your ground. &gt;&gt; Quit being a wishy-washy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; My family's harassing me and giving me a hard time about what I believe. Stand your ground. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Tell them, "I can't expect you to understand it. It has not been revealed to you. &gt;&gt; But neither can I apologize for the fact that God has made it a reality to me." &gt;&gt; So, let us fellowship. Let us have our enjoyment around things that we can agree on. and and don't make my religion always the subject of the dinner table conversation &gt;&gt; because you won't talk me out of it. &gt;&gt; Nobody talk me into it and nobody will talk me out of it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; My eyes are open because of his eyes. &gt;&gt; And I'm not budging. &gt;&gt; Don't you do like they do because you're with them. Don't you judge and condemn what they do because you're with them. &gt;&gt; Just be salty and full of light &gt;&gt; and show them that you are not a religious fanatic. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Well, uh, Uncle Uncle Lamar, notice I didn't use my first name. Uncle Lamar, would you like rice or potatoes? Well, praise God. Glory to God. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Woo. I'll take rice. &gt;&gt; Now, that might be slightly exaggerated, but I've been around folks like that. You You can't be a light when you look like you need a straight jacket. &gt;&gt; You got to use some good sense in this. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you that, you know, I I believe as much as anybody believes, but that turns me off. I find most of the time you don't even have to speak to the waitress about your faith or or &gt;&gt; because she'll become it won't take her too long. She'll begin to realize you're not the average table &gt;&gt; just because you were kind, &gt;&gt; just because you showed patience, &gt;&gt; just because you exercised this sense of understanding what it's like to be under pressure. &gt;&gt; Don't stiffer of a tip. &gt;&gt; Amen. after you've told her who your pastor is. &gt;&gt; Especially then, &gt;&gt; do like do like we have done. Make them fight for for who section you sit in. Make them follow you out to the car telling you you must have made a mistake. Not only has that happened to me several times, but I actually had a waitress follow me out to the to the vegetable and she said, "This is so embarrassing. I cannot believe that I'm going to do this." She said, "But I know you very well and I know that you usually leave a tip." And she said, "There was a glitch in this iPad." And she said, "It is not because I want to chase you for a tip. It is simply because I know that you intended to leave a tip and did not. Was I offended? Absolutely not. I said, "Well, I sure put the same tip that I always put on here." She said, "I I thought you probably did, but she said it somehow glitched out. Maybe I didn't hit the okay after I'd signed my name and put put in the amount. I don't know." That didn't offend me. it it because I know her and because I know things about her life because we've talked to one another. We have a little bit of a relationship. It actually made me feel good &gt;&gt; that she knew that it is my intention to make her life $15 easier, &gt;&gt; not $15 harder. &gt;&gt; You do that, brother sister. Brother Brandham taught us to do that. &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Well, I couldn't afford that. Eat it home then." &gt;&gt; Amen. Add a little water to the soup and keep going. &gt;&gt; We've all been there. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I'm on a roll, brother. You should have probably just stepped in and preached this morning. You knew I had a belly ache. &gt;&gt; Here's how to get rid of that ego thing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This quote was from last Sunday, and I didn't read it, so I will today. And I'm hurrying along now. It's 123. I want to want I want there to be somebody here Tuesday night, so I better stop. Uh, paragraph 38, greater than Solomon is here, Tucson, the church needs tonight, not a soft hybrid something. &gt;&gt; I prayed to the Lord this morning. I didn't know he was going to answer this quick, but I prayed to the Lord this morning and I said, Lord, I don't want to become that that I can't remember the exact words. Brother Daniel will remember the exact words of the quote, but that kind old priest. What was the doi? I said, "Oh Lord, I don't want to become that old Dodie priest who turns his head while his sons are committing adultery down there in the I'm not referring directly to my children because I hope they want to live. I hope they like breath and life more than this. But but I don't want to be the dirty old priest who says, "Y'all ought to do different. I wish y'all would do different. I think you really ought to do different." And turns his head while they continue to lay down and commit fornication in the doorway of the temple where doorway of the tabernacle where they come to bring their offerings before the Lord and prostituting the the women out. And and uh he just he he just was old and fat. I've got that part down pat. But he became sodi that and and it's happened through the script. Lord, I said to God this morning in in the shower. I don't guess you need to know that. But I said, "Oh Lord, please don't let me become that. Give me wisdom. Give me grace. Give me a kind heart. Let me show people how much I love them. And when they need to be corrected, give me courage." Amen. &gt;&gt; The church needs tonight not a soft hybrid, something soft and flabby like the church is. Just make a confession, be baptized, you're a Christian. He said this, this is some of the most important things. &gt;&gt; To be a Christian is self-denial. &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you something. For some of us, the only way we'll learn self-denial is to hang out a little while longer in the vessel of misunderstanding where people can't see what's really going on on the inside of us. All they can see is their perception. &gt;&gt; He said, "To be a Christian is self-denial. Deny yourself. Take up your cross. Follow me daily." Today it's so soft and people call themselves Christians when it used to mean death to confess Christ and you had to depend on him daily for everything you had need of. &gt;&gt; This season, this sacred season not only comes to break and crucify our ego, but it comes to purify and refine our motives. Purify is a broader term encompassing the removal of impurities to make something cleaner, more wholesome or morally acceptable. God said, "I'm going to use the misunderstandings to purify, to make you cleaner, to make you more wholesome, &gt;&gt; to make you morally acceptable. Not just in the eyes of people but in the eyes of the one who matters. He said to purify and refine. Refine typically refers to the removal of impurities also but from a substance to improve its quality and usability. Usability. Quality and usability. Somebody say with messability. The first things to go perhaps are the things that make us uh immoral, the things the choices that are bad, that are not righteous. Uh we are being purified. But when God starts refining what's left, he gets down into that uh uh uh uh separating us from the things that hinder our usability. And and I want to just talk to you from a from a from a pap's heart. Your usability is as valuable as anything there is about you. &gt;&gt; If God needs something done and he can't trust you to do it, you're not very usable. If God needs something said and he can't depend on me to hear it and say it, then I am greatly affecting my usability. &gt;&gt; I want to be purified from anything that would keep me from being the first that he would call on. &gt;&gt; Maybe not for the world, but for you people. I I would desire to be the first one that God would send to you. &gt;&gt; I don't want anything to hinder my usability. And and here's the pat part. One of the things that I have observed through the years that can affect your usability in a particular situation more than anything else is if you already have an opinion. And who doesn't have 11 dozens of those laying around at all times? Now, the Bob Jones that I knew was not a perfect man. In fact, I've not known very many perfect men, especially the ones that God's used in my life. I used to think that Brother Brandon was a perfect man, and I learned that he was not. He was a man mightily, greatly used of God, but flawed like every other vessel that God has ever used in the book. And if we would have been reading the book along with the books, we would have understood that if Moses was human, perhaps if Paul was perhaps, but we somehow missed that. But when God teaches you that, it actually becomes one of the greatest freedoms. I'm telling you, it's such a freedom when you know that your flaw, your human weakness, your your tendency to see things uh a little different than others because of your circumstances. When you find out that these things are not going to disqualify you, he may have to sharpen them, he may have to hone them, he may have to pull some of them out by the root, but they're not going to hinder you from being usable. I'm telling you, it it'll really set you free. &gt;&gt; And Bob used to tell this story that he had this invitation to to to a to speak at a particular large conference where he felt like he could actually be a blessing and he felt like that he might actually be able to to say something that others wouldn't say, but he had to tell them no. I read it where it had been written the first time, but I had an opportunity to sit with him. I had many opportunities to sit with him. And in one of those particular times, I asked him what was the real route. He said, "Well, the real root was as I as you read, I already had an opinion about that place. I already had an opinion about the pastor and about the congregation and what the direction they were going in. And I desperately wanted to release a word that would help them correct their direction. But the opinion, I found that the opinion that I had was so strong that as I begin to think of of preparing what I would say if I were there, I couldn't get that opinion separated from how I would present. So I didn't go. And I said, well, how is it that you came? This was party. I didn't read. I said, "How was it that you came to have such a strong opinion about them?" He said, "I listened to another person." I had never been there and at that time I had never invited had never been invited to be there. I had no thought of ever being invited to go there. So I sat and listened to another person slime that ministry and that preacher and tell all the dirt and bring up all the skeletons and say all the things that he possibly could. I should have stopped him. I could have stopped him. But I thought, well, I'll never be invited there. I'll never have an opportunity to go there. So there's no need for me to worry about, you know, here. It's not going to affect me. But he said, 'I found uh years later when the invitation came, it did affect me. So I'm telling you, not only as your pastor, but as a pap, you will greatly affect your usability in a situation if you already have an opinion &gt;&gt; about that person. &gt;&gt; And if an opinion is widespread, who's going to help them? Who's going to help him? &gt;&gt; I'm going to say that again. Who's going to help him? &gt;&gt; If we all have such a strong opinion, who could God use? &gt;&gt; Only a person who is able to climb up above their opinion. Because if you're if the situation is dire, if the situation is serious, you can't afford to go in his name &gt;&gt; with a word of wisdom mixed with your opinion. &gt;&gt; Because you'll do more damage than good. &gt;&gt; I've tell you folks, if there's one thing I've learned over the last some years about the prophetic is this. It's got to be pure. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's got to be without opinion. &gt;&gt; It's got to not even one part of it can be based on what you know or what you've heard or what you think &gt;&gt; or you will destroy someone. And not only will you destroy someone, you will destroy your usability &gt;&gt; to ever be able to help them again. Lord, purify us and then refine us &gt;&gt; and then refine us again. &gt;&gt; Aba also uses this season of misunderstanding to anchor you in God's approval rather than in the approval of men. If you're depending on someone else's attab boy, it's better to just remain being misunderstood than to depend on someone else's approval, adab boy, vindication. Well, I feel good because of my name was called in the service, you know. &gt;&gt; Don't I've been to services not too far from here where my name was called in the service as though I was sort of being lifted up or honored in some way. Maybe it meant something to someone who was with me. Maybe my church people were blessed because I was called out. But it didn't do a thing for me. Do you know why? because I knew not only was my name being called in the service, my name would be called after the service. And what was being said in the service wouldn't match what was being said after the service. So wouldn't you just rather be a fly on the wall &gt;&gt; instead of somebody recognized by name? Can Come on, folks. They will embrace you to your face, eat you alive when you're gone. And I'm dumb enough, thank God, to actually hide people often like that. That means you don't post a picture with them. You don't call their name in conversation. You don't mention their name in your pull pit because to do so would be to out the fact that they're two-faced and can't be trusted. Brother, I could be an expert on the vessel of misunderstanding and yet I would rather God send me back there again and again and again than to let something hinder me in the end of my life &gt;&gt; that would unravel and undo any good that I might have accomplished with his help in the earlier part of my life. I hope you can hear my heart. It can best be described as a season of distorted perception. We're not looking for man's approval. We're looking for God's approval. &gt;&gt; Remember, God spoke to my heart very directly, very plainly, and he and he said, "The only way I I mean, maybe I've never told this whole part, but I will now that I've opened it up. I always tell the end part, but I don't usually tell the beginning part." But I was praying about a particular thing that God would use me in a particular way. And the Lord answered by saying, "The only way that I can answer that prayer is to make you a gazing stock." And then before I had a chance to say yes, he said, "And I'm going to make you a gazing stop." Now, who in the world would want to be a gazing stop? I don't think that means look to you to follow your example. I think it means look to you and carefully scrutinize you and everything you do and everything you wear and everything you say and they'll misunderstand your your thoughts about the gifts and they'll not not too many years ago I preached here at camp meeting a service about the secret power of the bride and I spoke about the power of praying in tongues. Someone sitting in that service went home and told their whole church and family that I I was preaching if you didn't speak in tongues, you didn't have the Holy Ghost. I didn't know that night I was in the vessel of misunderstanding. I never said that because I never believe that. &gt;&gt; But what I do believe is that that if you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost sometime or another, he said &gt;&gt; you will. So if you haven't, you might ought to consider the fact that it's available to you. &gt;&gt; Because if it's a weapon &gt;&gt; and you're not using it in the battle, &gt;&gt; come on. &gt;&gt; It's every it's almost every service that someone, you know, so quickly can take one thing. &gt;&gt; That's right. But you've got to be willing to and and you two in the pew, you've got to be willing to withstand that &gt;&gt; or you're not usable. Who who would who would sign up? If God said tonight, the only way I can answer your prayer is to make you a gazing stock. Who would sign up? A few. A few. God bless you because you're needed. You're not being seen accurately. Your words, your motives or callings are viewed with suspicion because some people have the gift of suspicion instead of the gift of discernment. And don't you don't you uh misunderstand. There are people that I don't trust. And there are people in this room that I don't trust, but I love them. I love them. And I know the same God who made you or me or anybody else trustworthy. Don't you want to be in relation with somebody that you can believe what comes out of their mouth? &gt;&gt; Wouldn't that be a wonderful thing, Sister Flo, to be able to have fellowship with people who you could believe what they say? &gt;&gt; I would love that. But the reality is you're not always in a position to do that. But don't give up on people. &gt;&gt; Love them anyway. Pray for them anyway. Ask God to help them anyway. &gt;&gt; Don't treat them differently because you can't trust them. &gt;&gt; Treat them the best way you can. Don't go into business with them. &gt;&gt; Don't take everything they say as the gospel record. &gt;&gt; But don't stop loving them. Lord have mercy. That's the only thing that's going to keep some people holding on by a thread is for you to show them a little bit of love. &gt;&gt; You do that. We must. Might not be as much as they want or need, but I want to tell you something. If you can love your enemy, &gt;&gt; you can love a fallen brother &gt;&gt; or a fallen sister. Woo. the criticisms or stories sometime that are told on you when you're hanging in that vessel of misunderstanding. Sometimes they're inaccurate, sometimes they're false, but you have to go through it because of the pressure that it builds up in your life. &gt;&gt; You suffer for lies or worse for truths that people don't want to acknowledge. Likewise, in this season, people may may tend to see you through the tented lens of bias, rumor, or misunderstanding. Bias, how many of you really know what a bias is? Let me help you. Bias is defined as a prejudice. And there are usually two kinds of biases that are mentioned in in our society. One is an explicit or a conscious bias and one is an implicit or an unconscious bias because most of the time when someone jumps up and says I have no bias, they're biased, they're prejudiced. The first person to say, I I'm not racial prejudice is racial prejudice because if you weren't, you wouldn't have to say it because your life would have already proven it. So be quiet. You're spilling your secret. &gt;&gt; But it is possible to to have a conscious bias, a prejudice that you're conscious of. Perhaps it's also possible to have one that you're unconscious of and implicit, but it's a prejudice in favor or against one thing, a person, a group, a race compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair. There is an awful bias around this message toward people who are still in denominational systems. It's a bias. I saw it unraveling this week again. Another another thread. Facebook prophets. Someone said what what the scripture said, what brother Brandham said about not being unequally yolked together with unbelievers. and someone ask a fair question. Not argue and not trying to argue with the scripture or the quote, but ask a fair question. Well, what is a what is a an unbeliever? Are we talking about those who believe the message? Because I've noticed that over the past 15 years, that's the bias. You're not even called a believer. In fact, they've now used the word believer for those who attend a message church. Well, I want you to know that's not what Jesus had in mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he said, "Whosoever believeth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not what he said. But that's how it's come to be interpreted. And so, someone just ask a simple question. Are we talking about a believer because he believes the message of the hour and recognizes Brother Brham as a prophet? Are we talking about a believer because he sees his need for salvation? He believes. He accepts the gift. He believes that Jesus is the way out and he confesses with his mouth because remember brother Brandham says it's the ABCs. Accept, believe, confess. &gt;&gt; And that makes you a what? &gt;&gt; A believer. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, does that mean that I think that that one who believes this message should take a companion from the Baptist church or the Methodist church? No, I don't think that's a good idea. But that wasn't the question. &gt;&gt; This brother said, "Would you help define what a believer is?" &gt;&gt; You see, you don't have to understand everything there is to know about the seven seals to be a believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you are a believer, you ought to want to know more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've had people argue with me that there will won't be anybody in heaven that doesn't know the ministry and recognize the ministry in the name of William Brandham. And I said, "Well, I tell you what, that's a heaven I'm not really interested in. I've actually lived in that one already. The one I'm interested in is with a God who has a way of escape, a way of salvation. They may have come through a lot of stuff. Many will give their lives. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Not because they're unbelievers, but because they're believers. But in God's predestinated plan, there are uh there are those who are uh you know in the church &gt;&gt; universal. And there are those who are uh called to overcome. &gt;&gt; And that's why John the Revel to the church, right? To the to the overcomer, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Right. &gt;&gt; Nathan stood in the back hall there one day and and gave us this uh you know helped us to understand that that all all uh message uh people those who accept the the the message of the hour they're they're all believers. But it's a difference between believer and bride. &gt;&gt; All bride has to be a believer. &gt;&gt; But all and all bride started as a believer. But that doesn't make and you do the church, the bride, the believer, the overcomer. You do it the same way. &gt;&gt; Come on. Let's not be so so ridiculous here. Whosoever calleth upon the name of the Lord. If you believe in your heart and confess with your mouth and then you go on to obey and live the closest life you can live, here's what the prophet told you. He said, "According to the light &gt;&gt; that God has shined in your life, what God has let you see?" &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you see? &gt;&gt; I am. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you're an eagle &gt;&gt; and not an eagle maniac? &gt;&gt; How many of you'd rather be an eagle than an eagle maniac? &gt;&gt; God help us. &gt;&gt; Oh, that got more quiet than anything I've said. God hides you in that shadow, in that dark place when you're in the vessel of misunderstanding, not to forget you, but he wants to finish fermenting you for future usefulness. In that place, your words are twisted, your motives are questioned, your identity is dismissed. Obedience to God leads to suspicion from men. Many times you suffer for false stories or truths that others reject. Like David before Goliath or Paul on trial, your calling, your faith is questioned but not recognized. You are seen through the opinions and biases of others. Instead, the wine is judged by the perception of the filter, through the colored glass. And and no one went through this anymore. And I'm closing. Musicians are coming. No one went through this anymore than David. Melik Davidid, King David. Bless his heart. You dare want to throw up every time his name is mentioned, all you want to mention is Bath Sheba. Are you kidding me? &gt;&gt; Mention his prayer of repentance and confession. &gt;&gt; Mention the fact that he had to be anointed three different times &gt;&gt; before he got to be who God called him to be. &gt;&gt; First by Samuel, then by Judah, then by all of Israel. And I may have the two in the middle out of order. Before he could be the king over the United Kingdom of Israel, he was anointed three times. And look what he went through. The bear didn't get him. The lion didn't get him. Goliath didn't get him. Saul didn't get him. &gt;&gt; He survived all the beasts. &gt;&gt; You will too. &gt;&gt; You will too. I will too. &gt;&gt; Four-legged and two-legged. We will. We will. We will. Because greater is he that is in us. &gt;&gt; Don't you get you a little martyed? Don't you get your little martyr complex and go out here today, nobody understands you. &gt;&gt; Nobody understands me. Because the reality is some of you would be much easier understood if you would try to be. &gt;&gt; You don't even try to be understood. You try to be as odd as as you could possibly be. You you you find your identity. Whoa. Amen. &gt;&gt; In your oddness. So don't you go out here and know about me. Have you ever thought about maybe just settling into the family and not always having to be the center of attention? Have you ever just thought about being a part of the family? Uh, God bless you. Shaking hands, normal, hugging, normal, treating people normal, just be a part of the family instead of it always having to be about you're different. You're different. You're different. So different. Oh, it's going to be quiet. I don't care. I don't care. I paid a price to get here today. I don't care. I'm going to obey. I'm going to say everything. I don't want to feed I want to make sure before I close that I don't feed that kind of spirit on somebody to where they think that that I'm just so misunderstood. I'm so perfect but everybody misunderstands me. No, don't you get that on you. &gt;&gt; If you're there, you've got two reasons for being there or two two excuses we could say for being there. It could be that God has put you there. It could be that you refuse to leave [Music] &gt;&gt; when he got ready to pour you out. You found your value in swimming the other way. &gt;&gt; You were reading one day, I will have a peculiar people. And you said, I must be that one. I must make sure that everybody knows that the standard doesn't apply to me. I'm my own person. I want everybody to know. I want everybody to know. I I want everybody to know. There are people who just want everybody to know. I can't I can't eat nuts. Don't eat them. You know, there's just people that just it's the first thing you learn about people is all of this uh they they they stay too long in the vessel of misunderstanding. You shook yourself up. You got so shook up. We do this when we're immature. When I first had a son, I got jealous. after the first week because everybody else wanted to hold him. That's how immature I was. I just loved him so much. I didn't mind his mama holding him. She desperately needed to hold him at times. But I I got a little jealous. I was immature. And I'm willing to have you look at me like I'm weird because I know I'm not the only one that's ever experienced that feeling. And then you start maturing a little bit and you think, "Oh, Lord, would somebody please take him?" Oh, I don't think I can take no more. Please. You walk the floor and walk the floor and walk the floor. Is that right, mama? And he poops and screams and poops and screams and poops and screams. Oh, God help us. I wish somebody would come and hold him. One night, my wife was ex totally exhausted. We weren't like some of you who have, you know, just readily available people who will lay down their life and help you raise your children. We didn't have that. My mother was working. My father didn't know me. My wife's parents lived in a foreign country and there were many many times we we had nobody. Guess what you do when you have nobody? You do it. &gt;&gt; You pull up your bootstraps and you look each other in the eye and you say, "We can do this." &gt;&gt; And you do it. If you don't have to, God bless you. I'm glad you don't. But I remember looking at my wife one night and she was absolutely exhausted and so was I. And even though my mother had to work the next morning, I said, "I'm going to call them all." And and normally she would have said, "No, no, no, no, don't do that. We can get through the night. We can do it. We can get through the night." But this night, she said through the tears. And then I And then I'm sitting there thinking, I was jealous because I didn't get to hold him. And now I just want somebody any stranger in in the pl you know come hold my baby because you see how you get some of us have not matured. &gt;&gt; Some of us have not let the experiences of life grow us up. &gt;&gt; And this is part of the sacred season that we're in right now. May God give us strength to bite the bullet in this uncomfortable time of being misunderstood. And may we not spend one extra night in the vessel of misunderstanding because we have found our identity or our comfort in being misunderstandable. &gt;&gt; But may we be ready to be poured out into something else because it may be worse. The next vessel might be harder. &gt;&gt; So we want to have all the strength we can muster. But at the end of this, I can do it because greater. &gt;&gt; I can make it. I'm an overcomer. Hallelujah. I'm not just a believer. I'm a believer. &gt;&gt; I don't just have faith. I have access to super faith. &gt;&gt; I don't just I didn't just meet Jesus. I have a revelation of who Jesus is. &gt;&gt; And he's on board. I don't have to go to the to the confession booth to find him &gt;&gt; or count the beads to get forgiveness &gt;&gt; or say the Apostles Creed or Hail Mary. He lives in me &gt;&gt; and he's as close as the mention of his name. &gt;&gt; He's great and greatly to be praised. He's worthy. If you're leaving here thinking that I don't love you, think again. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the truth because I do. You'll be more you'll be more uh likely to build relationships if you can learn how to walk into a room. You will because of some of our stuff. It it goes with us. we carry it and it it frightens people. It puts people at odds. They don't know how to embrace you because you you're bigger than life. You don't know how to just be our cousin, our family member, our brother, our sister. Don't let the enemy tell you that people are rejecting you and you have nothing to do with it because sometimes we do. &gt;&gt; Being a nervous person, I know that I project that and it makes other people nervous and you don't want to be that. You You want to try. Anybody following me? You don't have to always be grouchy. Love somebody. Don't just pick out weaker ones to be your support system. &gt;&gt; Build a relationship with a with a prayer warrior. &gt;&gt; Build your relationship with somebody that's as on fire for God Monday at noon &gt;&gt; as they are Sunday at noon. Don't find all of your validation out there in the world among sinners either. &gt;&gt; Find somebody in the household of faith and crucify and deny all of yourself until you can begin to build a relationship with somebody that knows you. See, the family knows you and they love you anyway. Let me see if that's that was I think maybe that's all. Do I need to call you up? [Music] rather have Jesus &gt;&gt; than silver or gold. I'd rather be his than have riches untold. I'd rather have Jesus &gt;&gt; than houses or &gt;&gt; I'd rather be led &gt;&gt; by his name [Music] &gt;&gt; than to be a king of the last and behus. [Music] this world a today. more than to be a king of a master and beheld him s. [Music] Oh, I ra have Jesus in him. anything that [Music] will raus [Music] men applause. Oh, I'd ra be faithful to his dear. I'd rather have Jesus more than worldwide fame. Oh, I'd ra be true to his holy name. more than to be a king of my glory and be held in sins. [Music] Oh, I'd ra Jesus [Music] this old world afford today. more than to be a king of the last or be held in sin dread sway. Oh, I ra have Jesus that this old world affords today. Bring the music down and sing it out. Oh, then to be a king of [Music] and be held in sway. Oh, I'd rather have Jesus than anything [Music] that this world a Jesus Surrender all to him I free. &gt;&gt; I will ever love and I'll trust him in his presence daily. [Music] Oh, I surrender all. [Music] Oh, I surrender all. Oh, to thee my blessed Savior. I surrender all and all to Jesus. I surrender humbly at his feet. My thou worldly pleasures all forsake and take me Jesus take me now. Oh I surrender all. Oh, I surrender all. Oh, to thee my blessed savior. I surrender all. &gt;&gt; Oh, I surrender all. I surrender all to Jesus to thee my bless. You know, there's a saying in in the world, be the change that you're looking for. Or maybe it didn't come from Proverbs, but the concept did. &gt;&gt; The scripture concept is if you are desperate for there to be a change, become the change. God called you and I to be agents and ambassadors of change. &gt;&gt; I wouldn't want you to misunderstand yourself. I would want you to know that God made you unique in every way. But that doesn't mean he wants to leave us with everything we came here with. &gt;&gt; There are times that he wants us to become agents of change. And I think I know the reason why. And I hate to hang it on you here at the end, but I think that we're really going to need each other in those last few days. I think we're really going to need each other. And some people are focused on making sure that there will be canned food to eat and grain stored up. And they're looking at it in a very practical way. God bless them. That's what they're called to do perhaps. But I don't think it's going to matter so much. What I believe is that we're going to need each other in every way &gt;&gt; to stand. I don't think it's going to be a long period of time. I think it's going to be just the last last little season before we go out of here. We're going to need each other. We're going to need to be able to trust each other. We're going to need to be able to get along with each other because in that quick short work, we're going to be spent for the gospel, for the kingdom message. Everything we carry is going to be poured out. And I don't know how. I don't know where. I don't know exactly what it will look like. But if we raise up to do what he said we would, that last climax of God's authority operating in sons, I think we're going to have to get ready. I think we're going to have to make preparation for those days. If you can't stand to be in the room with me now, &gt;&gt; see, we're going to have to get over some of our biases. &gt;&gt; We're going to have to learn to be to depend on one another. The one thing you don't want to is to be in the foxhole &gt;&gt; with somebody that has ambition &gt;&gt; or who loves their life more than yours. &gt;&gt; You actually want to try to be in there with somebody who is willing to risk their life for you, knowing that you're willing to risk your life for them. And that makes a safer foxhole. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because no matter who the target is, somebody's there to help cover and protect. Whether you realize it or not, I believe that's the hovering work of the Holy Spirit this morning. I believe he wants to protect us. I believe he wants to preserve us. &gt;&gt; And change is something you can chase or you can make up your mind to be the change. &gt;&gt; And the other thing the Lord spoke to me while we were singing is he reminded me the importance of harmony. Did you know there are people who can't sing the melody? They can't hear the melody. We have several in here who can't sing the melody because they don't they can't hear it. And they're almost always singing harmony and not always in the right key. But sometimes if you were just a little softer, your harmony, your voice would complement the one next to you and there would be that's what harmony is. It's layering pitches. Everyone doesn't sing tenor. Aren't you glad? Because sometimes I would go back and and hear where I sung a high tenor lead and it and it it I think how did people stand it? It feels like uh fingernails on the on the blackboard. What if we all were singing like that? What if we all to what if we could just uh use the the voice that God has given us and be mindful of making it blend &gt;&gt; with the person next to us. our tone, their tone, our voice, their voice. You layer those voices together and the sound gets so full. Now, I heard a little clip of a of a practice of the of the younger people here this week and uh I saw the video and it was before the the girls decided to sing. All they were doing was just moving their tiny little mouth and they reminded me of the little hamster that comes to get the little water bottle. But I was told that after that it got amazing because you you you your sound your sound is necessary. &gt;&gt; You you got to let it out. &gt;&gt; If you're doing it for the King of Kings, you you want to be heard, but you don't want to be the star. &gt;&gt; You wanna you want to make the star. You want to make the body the star &gt;&gt; and so you adjust your volume or your sound to try to complement the one next to you and that's harmony. And there's nothing more beautiful than when a family sings together and one's pitch is a little higher than the other and they're sliding around perhaps to find their place. But when they find it, it's music to the ear. It's music to the heart. It's music to the soul. And in this body, we have so many gifts and so much talent that that's not just music. But we've got to learn to figure out how to make our tone blend in harmony with someone else. Oh, that's flat. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe I should just call names and tell tell you some of you need to tune your tone. It's &gt;&gt; not the volume you need to worry about. It's the tone so that it and that carries over. It's not just music. It carries over into everything. &gt;&gt; You know, if if you if you're putting a meal together and two women argue over who makes the entree and you only need one and you ask for chicken and they want to bring steak, just blend. Don't make everything so complicated in life. Give up &gt;&gt; and make up your mind. I want to I want to blend with someone. I don't want to be that somebody. &gt;&gt; I want to blend. I want to make a family. I want to make God a a a living organism in this house. &gt;&gt; I want to give it to him. I want to be used for his glory. How many of you want to be usable? &gt;&gt; Then be blendable. &gt;&gt; Be the change that you desire to see. Father, here we are. This room is full of sincere hearts &gt;&gt; and potential overcomers. And we need each other in this thing. We we we we may not see it yet, but we will. And today we ask that you would anoint our eyes to see how we can be a an organism living, moving, breathing in the life of Jesus Christ. And in order to get there, we we have to be uh misunderstood, kind of gazed on at times as we learn our way and as we allow the least to settle in the wine. And every time we get all shook up, we cloudy the work that you're trying to accomplish in us. May we remain rock solid and ever steady in the service of the Lord. May we be dependable in every way. May we offer you everything that you would have us to leave behind. May we give it to you right now. And may we find grace to surrender. We ask for your help. It's the only help that's going to help is your help. We ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory. Would you raise both hands if you're able and sing one more time? I surrender. I &gt;&gt; surrender all. [Music] &gt;&gt; I surrender all. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. All to thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender. &gt;&gt; You're not surrendering for anybody but yourself. Oh, &gt;&gt; I surrender all. &gt;&gt; I surrender all. I surrender. &gt;&gt; Oh, that sounds good. Surrender all to thee my blessed I &gt;&gt; one more time tell him I surrender all &gt;&gt; Jesus I will surrender all &gt;&gt; hallelujah oh I surrender Glory be to God. To thee my blessed savior. [Music] &gt;&gt; As these young people continued to sing together, they begin to sound. I I I don't want to say it wrong. You would have thought there was 50 or more of them. The fullness that was beginning to come out of their mouths as they sung for the glory of God. And they entered in to what they were singing. And the way they were putting it out there, if you hadn't have known how many there would have been, you'd have thought it was a a full house choir. That's what happens when everybody has the same mind. May we find that as our example. May May we hear the same out of our little children's choir. May we hear the same when we are worshiping in here. Not just that the music is it, but in everything we do. May we find our place to support one another in this thing. Lay your hand on the one next to you now. Father, strength to my brother, strength to my sister. It won't be easy getting them all the way through any of the vessels, but they're coming through. They're coming through. They're not going to face it alone. They're coming through. They're going to find their place in the chalice of the king. They're going to find their place as wine in your cup. We're going to find our place in the kingdom of our God. Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. Bless the Lord. Bless his name. Father, for every person who uh struggles in this hour, may you surround them with your wonderful love. May you remind them you are not in this alone. &gt;&gt; Father, whether we feel you, whether we see you, whether we know what you're doing or not, we trust the promise of your word. You are working a work of glory in the deepest part of who we are. Go be free, Holy Spirit. Do what needs to be done in us. Build us together, stronger for your kingdom. And may our love for one another be more than just a greeting. May it be deep. May it be love that covers. May it be love that empowers. May it be love that prepares us for rapture. &gt;&gt; This is what we desire &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. You're dismissed to go. Sing as you leave. I surrender all. I surrender all. I surrender all. All to thee my blessed savior I surrender all to Jesus I surrender make me save your holy thine and let me Feel the Holy Spirit. They know that thou are mine. I surrender all. I surrender all. All to thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender all. Oh, and I surrender all. I surrender all. To thee, my blessed Savior, I surrender all.
