[34:53] &gt;&gt; for your glory.
[34:55] Be lifted [music and singing] high.
[34:59] One more time.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Oh, be lifted high. Be lifted [singing]
[35:04] high.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; Be [music] lifted high
[35:09] &gt;&gt; for your glory. [singing]
[35:11] [music] be lifted
[35:13] high.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord, you and you alone are the one
[35:20] that we desire to be lifted high
[35:23] that no [music] man may glory in your
[35:25] sight but only you would receive the
[35:28] glory and the praise and the adoration
[35:31] for you are worthy. The one who died
[35:35] that we could have life. the one who
[35:38] gave himself that we could be redeemed
[35:40] back to our original state. Oh Lord, we
[35:44] thank you that you are who you say you
[35:47] are and we are here today that you may
[35:50] be glorified and praised in this house
[35:53] for you are good and you are merciful.
[35:57] &gt;&gt; We bless you today.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:05] Blessed be the Lord.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; There is no other name
[36:10] &gt;&gt; but the name Lord Jesus Christ.
[36:14] Let him be exalted.
[36:17] &gt;&gt; As we go to prayer today,
[36:20] we know that there is salvation in no
[36:22] other name but the name the Lord Jesus
[36:25] Christ. It is through and by him that we
[36:28] have healing for our physical bodies.
[36:31] And I'm so thankful that it just doesn't
[36:34] it's not just for our physical body, but
[36:36] it can be for our mind,
[36:39] our will, our emotions, everything that
[36:42] we are going through.
[36:46] By that name, there is healing and
[36:49] deliverance and help. Do you have a need
[36:51] you'd just like to make known by the
[36:53] lifting of the hand? We want to remember
[36:57] brother Austin and sister Anna. Their
[36:59] children are both sick today. We want to
[37:01] remember them to the Lord. Ask the Lord
[37:03] to minister health into their bodies.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Always remember
[37:08] to no matter what's going on that's
[37:12] always hold her up. Believe that God
[37:15] will give her victory through every
[37:16] situation.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[37:18] &gt;&gt; there are many requests that have come
[37:20] in uh while we were gone. So many people
[37:23] said, "Remember me. Remember me." We
[37:25] might not be able to recall all their
[37:27] names at one time, but God saw everyone.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Oh yes, he does. Because if if someone
[37:32] has enough faith to ask you to remember,
[37:34] then their faith is in the Lord.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; And I know he's able.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. Also remembering Sister Lydia,
[37:42] Sister Alfreda.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Brother and Sister Wgner. Remembering
[37:46] them to the Lord. Sister Judith, will
[37:48] you sing this course as we're getting
[37:49] ready to pray and take these needs to
[37:51] our papa?
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Remember David and Ashley's little ones,
[37:57] too. That Lord will give them a complete
[37:59] victory.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[38:02] Any other sickness through the body
[38:05] given for
[38:06] &gt;&gt; total deliverance.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Sing this course with us today.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; Come
[38:14] Holy [singing] Spirit.
[38:17] &gt;&gt; I need you. [singing]
[38:23] Come
[38:26] sweet [music] spirit
[38:28] I pray.
[38:32] [singing]
[38:34] Come
[38:36] in [music] your strength and
[38:39] your power. [singing]
[38:44] Come [singing]
[38:46] in thine [music] own gentle
[38:50] way. Brother Daniel, will you come and
[38:52] pray today?
[38:55] Come, [singing]
[38:57] Holy [music] Spirit.
[39:00] I need thee.
[39:05] Come, [singing]
[39:07] [music] sweet spirit,
[39:10] I pray.
[39:16] Come [singing]
[39:17] in thy strength [music] and
[39:20] thy power.
[39:26] Come
[39:28] in thine own.
[39:34] Oh Lord, as we approach you this morning
[39:36] once again,
[39:38] it's so easy for us to see so many
[39:41] things that we have to be thankful for
[39:43] today.
[39:44] The greatest thing, Lord, is that you
[39:47] come by and you spend time with us,
[39:50] Lord. That you would take up your abode
[39:52] with us and that you would dwell within
[39:55] your people,
[39:57] Lord, desiring that you would move on
[39:58] the behalf of the needs of your body.
[40:01] All the requests that were turned in,
[40:03] Lord, not just for the physical
[40:05] well-being, Lord, but the mental
[40:07] well-being, the soul, our souls. Lord,
[40:09] we need you to minister healing. We
[40:12] don't want to be like we were though
[40:14] Lord. We want to be what you want us to
[40:16] be. We desire today to hear the word of
[40:19] God in clarity. We ask you to come with
[40:22] great uncction, with power, Lord. We
[40:25] know your word has authority and that
[40:26] not one word of it spoken can return to
[40:29] you void. And we're asking Lord that
[40:31] today as we sit under the hearing of the
[40:34] word that our lives would be
[40:35] transformed. That we would mature in you
[40:37] Lord. We would be adults Lord God. We
[40:41] don't want to stay forever on the
[40:43] sincere milk alone, Lord. But we want
[40:44] the meat of the word. We want to know
[40:46] all of you, oh God. We want to hear
[40:49] everything that you have for us. We want
[40:51] nothing to be left undone or hidden. Oh
[40:54] God,
[40:56] we believe you're the same yesterday,
[40:57] today, and forever. And that there's
[41:00] nothing that you can't do. There's no
[41:02] power that you're not above.
[41:06] So we surrender our will to yours.
[41:09] We surrender all our will.
[41:15] We ask that it be done in earth. Oh, in
[41:18] this flesh, oh God, in this dirt that
[41:21] I'm made of. May it be done in this
[41:23] earth as it is in heaven. Your will. And
[41:26] we'll glorify you for what [music]
[41:28] you're doing. We'll testify, Lord. We'll
[41:31] keep our globes polished so that the
[41:33] light of you can be seen by the world.
[41:35] and we'll give you all the praise as we
[41:38] ask it in the name above all names,
[41:40] Yeshua Hamashiach, our Messiah, the Lord
[41:43] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Praise your name, Lord.
[41:49] &gt;&gt; We give you the praise.
[41:54] Hallelujah.
[42:01] You may have your seats today.
[42:08] We're so happy to see the number back up
[42:12] today to see you in the house of the
[42:13] Lord. We're happy to welcome the
[42:16] newlyweds, Brother Steven, Sister Lydia,
[42:18] back to the service
[42:20] [applause] after being married last
[42:22] week.
[42:27] Brother Gary and Sister Donna, we're
[42:29] glad that you're doing better and that
[42:31] you're able to be in the service today.
[42:32] God bless you both.
[42:37] Michael and Crystalin and the babies
[42:39] doing better. We're glad that they're
[42:41] back in the house of the Lord.
[42:43] [applause]

[42:48] I'm sorry. I'm glad you're here.
[42:51] &gt;&gt; This friend that sister Rebecca has with
[42:53] her, Hyong, I believe is her name. We're
[42:55] glad that you're here today. God bless
[42:57] you.
[42:59] [applause]
[43:02] I hope I got that right. We're glad that
[43:04] you're here. We're glad for every one of
[43:06] you. Those of you that are watching by

[43:12] your house by by watching this service
[43:16] being a part of us and what the Lord is
[43:18] doing here. We're just blessed to have
[43:21] our pastor home and very blessed to know
[43:24] that the Lord touched his body and that
[43:26] he is feeling strong in the Lord today
[43:28] that he'll be able to preach to us.
[43:31] [applause]
[43:33] Thankful for it.
[43:36] Praise the Lord. We want to receive the
[43:38] tithe and offering. We want to give to
[43:40] the Lord. He has blessed us. He has
[43:43] provided for us. Uh Brother IAS, I'm
[43:47] glad you're feeling better. I'm going to
[43:49] ask you and brother Austin to go to the
[43:51] people today to give let them give to
[43:54] the Lord. Sing this course. How great is
[43:56] our God? How great is his word? He's the
[43:59] greatest one that was ever heard.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; As we're receiving the tithe and the
[44:04] offering,
[44:07] how great is our God? [singing]
[44:12] [music] How great is his word?
[44:16] He's the greatest one
[44:18] [music and singing]
[44:20] that ever was heard.
[44:24] He rolled back the water
[44:28] of the mighty Red Sea.
[44:32] And he said, "I will lead you.
[44:36] Put [music] your trust in me."
[44:40] How great is our [music] God.
[44:45] How great is his word?
[44:48] [music] He's the greatest one
[44:53] that ever was heard.
[44:57] He rolled back the water
[45:01] of the mighty Red Sea.
[45:03] [music and singing]
[45:05] And he said, "I will lead you.
[45:09] Put your trust in me."
[45:13] How great is our [music] God?
[45:17] How great is his name?
[45:20] [music]
[45:20] [singing]
[45:21] He's the greatest one. Forever the same.
[45:26] Forever the same. [music and singing]
[45:30] He rolled back the water [music]
[45:34] of the mighty Red Sea [singing]
[45:38] and he [music] said, "I will lead you.
[45:42] Put your trust in me [music]
[45:45] once again. How great is our God?
[45:49] [singing and music]
[45:51] How great is his word?
[45:55] He's the [music] greatest one
[45:59] that ever was heard.
[46:03] He rolled back the water
[46:06] [music]
[46:07] of the mighty Red Sea
[46:11] and he said, "I will lead [singing]
[46:13] [music] you.
[46:15] Put your trust in me." [singing]
[46:22] Oh, hallelujah.
[46:26] Praise the Lord.
[46:30] You may have your seats. Once again, I
[46:32] would like to give two public service
[46:34] announcements.
[46:37] &gt;&gt; We've got cold weather coming in.
[46:42] Not so much tonight as tomorrow night.
[46:44] Make sure you undo all of your hoses.
[46:49] I don't know that it'll be cold enough
[46:50] to let a faucet drip, but it'd be wise
[46:53] to undo your hoses. And as you feel led,
[46:56] let your faucet drip. Put some heat on.
[46:58] It's going to be cold down into the 20s.
[47:01] So, that's the first public service
[47:03] announcement because we don't like to
[47:06] fix water pipes.
[47:09] Uh the other one is
[47:12] I felt very sad on behalf of Brother
[47:16] Jerry this week when I found out that
[47:20] he's been with us for quite some time
[47:22] and he just found out about the table
[47:24] app. And so many times you will hear us
[47:28] reading quotations from brother
[47:30] Brandham. And those of you that may be
[47:33] new among us and don't realize on your
[47:36] phone there is an app that you can get
[47:39] to listen to any and all of Brother
[47:41] Brandham's messages. And it's called the
[47:44] table app. And I don't suggest you
[47:47] search any farther than that. But uh
[47:49] because you'll find all kinds of
[47:51] garbage. But the table app will allow
[47:54] you to listen to all of Brother
[47:56] Brandham's sermons. And if you wish to,
[47:59] you can follow along because they're all
[48:02] transcribed and it will allow you to
[48:05] read the sermon with it if you are so
[48:07] able to do. But I I just wanted to make
[48:10] that uh announcement to those that may
[48:13] not have been aware because you don't
[48:16] have to go to YouTube. We have some of
[48:18] them uh on the our app, but not all of
[48:21] them. And a lot of the older ones from
[48:24] the 50s may not be on our app, but you
[48:26] can get all of them on the table app.
[48:29] And it makes it so convenient to be able
[48:31] to listen in that manner.
[48:34] And so with that, we're turning our
[48:37] hearts toward the preaching of the word.
[48:39] I believe that the Lord wants to speak
[48:42] to us today. He has something for us.
[48:45] Something that will help us in our
[48:48] journey. Would you stand with us?
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[48:52] &gt;&gt; Let's have Jacob. I know he hasn't
[48:54] practiced and we didn't warn him or
[48:56] anything. Let's have him come and sing a
[48:58] song before we go to the word.
[48:59] &gt;&gt; All right.
[49:06] [laughter]
[49:13] You're on the spot. This is your
[49:46] Like I said, I didn't get to practice
[49:47] and uh I had COVID last week and uh
[49:51] still trying to get rid of that. So,
[49:53] y'all pray for me, but I believe he'll
[49:54] give me the strength to get through it.
[49:56] Amen.
[49:58] [music]
[50:01] &gt;&gt; Well, get up. I get up. I get up in
[50:06] Jesus name.
[50:09] The Lord is calling daily
[50:12] for those who would be saved.
[50:16] Well, don't go down defeated when your
[50:21] victory's here to claim.
[50:24] So get up,
[50:26] get up or get up in Jesus name. [music]
[50:33] In that city called beautiful, there
[50:38] laid out in the street,
[50:41] a poor and lonely beggar
[50:45] who was crippled in his feet.
[50:49] As John and Peter passed him, [music]
[50:53] they saw his need was bad. They had no
[50:58] gold or silver, but they gave him what
[51:02] they had.
[51:04] So get up,
[51:06] get up,
[51:08] get up in Jesus name.
[51:12] The Lord is calling daily for those who
[51:17] would be saved.
[51:20] Well, don't go down defeated
[51:23] cuz your victory is here to claim. I get
[51:27] up.
[51:29] Get up. I get up in Jesus name. [music]
[51:36] In this world that we live in, there's
[51:41] evil everywhere.
[51:44] The body gets discouraged
[51:48] and overcome with fear.
[51:52] Well, God needs his some soldiers
[51:56] to take out of him and take back the
[52:01] power that John and Peter used.
[52:06] So get up. I get up. I get up in Jesus
[52:12] name.
[52:14] The Lord is calling daily to those who
[52:19] would be saved.
[52:21] Well, don't go down defeated when your
[52:25] victory is here to claim.
[52:29] I get up,
[52:31] get up. I get up in Jesus name. Well,
[52:36] get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
[52:41] in Jesus name.
[52:44] The Lord is calling daily to those who
[52:49] would BE SAVED.
[52:51] WELL, DON'T go down defeated when your
[52:56] victory is here to claim. So get up,
[53:01] get up,
[53:03] get up in Jesus [music]
[53:05] name.
[53:09] World that we live in, there's evil
[53:14] everywhere.
[53:16] My body gets discouraged
[53:20] and overcome with fear.
[53:24] What God needs is some soldiers
[53:27] to get out of your pews
[53:31] and take back the power that John and
[53:36] Peter used.
[53:39] So get up.
[53:41] Get up.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Get up.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Get up in Jesus name. Now the Lord is
[53:48] calling daily to those who [music] would
[53:52] be saved.
[53:54] Don't go down defeated
[53:57] when your victory is here to claim
[54:01] or get up.
[54:03] Get up. [music]
[54:04] Get up.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; I get up in Jesus name.
[54:09] [music]
[54:11] I get up
[54:12] &gt;&gt; get up. Get up.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Get up. I get up in Jesus name.
[54:25] [music]
[54:31] [applause]
[54:33] Hallelujah.
[54:41] &gt;&gt; You You passed You passed the audition.
[54:44] Wasn't that lovely?
[54:46] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[54:50] [applause]
[54:53] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. You can do that again.
[54:56] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. It's wonderful to be
[54:58] in the house of the Lord.
[55:01] &gt;&gt; Really enjoyed that.
[55:04] &gt;&gt; Uh Jacob has come a long way from the
[55:07] little boy that he was
[55:09] to be a a grown boy.
[55:13] That's all I'm willing to say just yet.
[55:16] We don't want them. We don't want
[55:18] anything beyond that. You need to work
[55:20] on my mic up there, somebody.
[55:23] Okay. But anyway, we're very glad to see
[55:26] you in the house of the Lord. And I
[55:28] can't express to you enough how thankful
[55:31] I am for your prayers.
[55:34] Very, very thankful.
[55:36] They'll keep working on it till they get
[55:38] it. The Lord really touched me. You
[55:41] know, sometimes we begin to get over
[55:43] something gradually,
[55:45] &gt;&gt; and we we're thankful,
[55:48] &gt;&gt; but there are times when the Lord moves.
[55:51] I mean, he really moves to heal.
[55:53] &gt;&gt; Do you believe he's still a healer?
[55:56] &gt;&gt; I I believe all healing comes from the
[55:58] Lord.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; And um
[56:02] I had one of those moments on Thursday.
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Took a while, but it it shifted so
[56:09] quickly.
[56:10] that I knew the Lord had moved for me
[56:13] and I appreciate it so much. Uh and he
[56:16] gave me strength. I had been so weak and
[56:19] uh he gave me strength and I want him to
[56:22] receive all the glory
[56:25] &gt;&gt; because I didn't have any medicine. I
[56:28] would have taken anything I could have
[56:30] if id had it. But the Lord did it.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; And I appreciate your prayers for all of
[56:36] us while we traveled. We're very happy
[56:38] to be back.
[56:40] But we really enjoyed ourselves in
[56:42] Indiana.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Indiana is a beautiful place. Uh
[56:47] I personally wouldn't perhaps desire to
[56:50] live there, but I sure do love looking
[56:52] at the beauty of it. The farm country,
[56:55] the beauty of the trees this time of
[56:58] year. It is the goodness of God that
[57:01] lets us see these things. Yes.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; When I walked into the church there uh
[57:07] among the former Amish brothers and
[57:08] sisters on Friday evening for the
[57:11] rehearsal and I saw the beauty of the
[57:15] place, the surrounding of the place, the
[57:18] out outside,
[57:21] the neighborhood so to speak, where it
[57:23] was, the beauty was inspirational. But
[57:27] when I went inside and saw this church
[57:29] that has been raised up for the glory of
[57:31] God,
[57:33] &gt;&gt; knowing that they have met many times in
[57:36] homes and barns and wherever else that
[57:39] they could meet and if you know about
[57:42] the Amish faith itself, you know they
[57:44] don't have church buildings and they go
[57:47] from house to house and they bring the
[57:49] benches with them and they push the
[57:51] furniture back and they have church uh
[57:54] in homes and So the fact that God has
[57:58] brought them so far and then turned
[57:59] around and blessed them not only with a
[58:02] comfortable place but with a beautiful
[58:04] place,
[58:05] &gt;&gt; I couldn't keep the tears back. They
[58:07] just they formed and I just said over
[58:09] and over to God be the glory.
[58:12] &gt;&gt; And uh they're some of the most
[58:14] wonderful and precious people I have
[58:15] ever known. And we appreciated our time
[58:19] with them. And Pastor Isaac is an
[58:21] outstanding brother and his family, they
[58:24] are precious. We love to hear you sing
[58:27] here on Sunday when you lift your voices
[58:29] and it just echoes through this room.
[58:32] But I'll tell you, I think last Sunday
[58:35] uh they they had us beat.
[58:38] the the volume of the singing was so
[58:41] loud, so full,
[58:45] so many people participating
[58:48] that it just almost lifted you off the
[58:50] floorise.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; And uh Josh, you must have felt some of
[58:54] that or been because you sent me some of
[58:56] it. He he he caught some of it, captured
[58:59] just tiny little clips of it. I was uh
[59:02] standing on the front row with Pastor
[59:04] Isaac and his family and his little
[59:06] children and they were singing. Oh my.
[59:14] I I thought I thought the window would
[59:17] crack
[59:19] and it was so amazing that I just
[59:22] watched them.
[59:24] I just couldn't help it because they
[59:26] were singing with their whole being.
[59:29] Praise God.
[59:29] &gt;&gt; They were making a joyful sound. It
[59:32] wasn't a noise to me. It was a joyful
[59:35] sound unto the Lord from the littlest
[59:37] one to the biggest. And I just turned
[59:40] around and I looked out over that
[59:42] wonderful crowd of people. Not only the
[59:44] local congregation, but those that had
[59:46] gathered for the great celebration of
[59:49] Brother Steven and Sister Lydia. and so
[59:52] many different faiths represented.
[59:56] But everyone worshiping the Lord in a
[59:59] similar manner. He's worthy.
[1:00:04] &gt;&gt; He's worthy to be praised.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; And we're thankful for the family of God
[1:00:09] in Cookamo, Indiana. Brother Dewey Moss,
[1:00:13] who we should remember his wife, Sister
[1:00:15] Minnie, to the Lord. She's in the
[1:00:17] hospital. She is not well. He was
[1:00:19] actually able to be in the service with
[1:00:21] us last Thursday night. Uh, a packed
[1:00:24] little house. And I I just won't take
[1:00:28] the time this morning to tell you some
[1:00:30] of the things that the Lord did. You
[1:00:32] don't always know in a service what God
[1:00:33] is doing, but when you begin to hear
[1:00:36] later, it was so wonderful to be in
[1:00:39] church with Jonathan's two sisters
[1:00:43] and and it felt warm. It felt beautiful.
[1:00:48] It felt healing. It felt right.
[1:00:51] And you would have to know our story and
[1:00:54] we ain't telling it
[1:00:58] to know what a miracle it was. And and
[1:01:01] they said, "Can we get our picture with
[1:01:03] you?" I said, "Are you kidding?"
[1:01:04] Absolutely.
[1:01:06] And and it's just a miracle what God can
[1:01:08] do
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; and how he can bring things together. I
[1:01:14] I want to serve him every day more and
[1:01:16] more. I want to love him more than I've
[1:01:18] ever loved him before. I want to be used
[1:01:21] more than I've ever been used in these
[1:01:24] last days.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; I know that brother Gley did a fine job.
[1:01:28] I haven't heard all the services, but I
[1:01:30] know that he did a fine job. You were
[1:01:32] wellfed. You were protected. You were
[1:01:35] kept good.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; And I thank you for that. Your faithful
[1:01:39] service.
[1:01:42] [applause]
[1:01:42] I didn't have to worry.
[1:01:47] And we're just grateful.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you ready for the word?
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; Let's thank the Lord for these
[1:01:53] musicians, the leading of the service.
[1:01:58] Can we stand for the reading of the word
[1:02:00] today? I want to read you again from
[1:02:04] Mark chap 16
[1:02:07] verses 15- 18.
[1:02:11] These are mostly red letters
[1:02:14] and uh it indicates to us that these are
[1:02:18] the words of our Lord and the words of
[1:02:21] our Lord should be exalted and held in
[1:02:24] preeminence above all else.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; Jesus should get the highest praise.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; He should be the most the most often
[1:02:34] name on our lips.
[1:02:37] &gt;&gt; We should sit down and talk about him.
[1:02:39] We should get up and talk about him,
[1:02:41] walk talking about him, eat talking
[1:02:44] about him, because he's worthy to be
[1:02:47] talked about.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; I don't know everything there is to know
[1:02:50] about him, but I love what I know
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; and I want to know him more.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; How many of you can say amen and really
[1:02:56] mean it?
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; I want to know him more. I know this. I
[1:03:00] know he hasn't changed.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; I know the same God that gave mana in
[1:03:05] the wilderness, he's alive today. The
[1:03:08] same God who parted the Red Sea, he's
[1:03:10] alive today.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; I believe that.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; If he ever did it once, he can
[1:03:14] absolutely do it again if he chooses to.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; I am not a secessionist. I don't believe
[1:03:20] that he has lost his power.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; I believe he can do today anything we
[1:03:25] have the faith to believe him to do.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; I I I'm thankful that he opened blinded
[1:03:30] eyes. I believe he still has the power
[1:03:33] to do so.
[1:03:36] You you ought to be amen and big loud.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; He still has the power to do so.
[1:03:42] &gt;&gt; If he ever healed one marriage, and I
[1:03:44] know he has, he can still heal a
[1:03:46] marriage.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; If he's ever supernaturally provided for
[1:03:52] for your financial need or anybody
[1:03:55] else's need, just made a way where there
[1:03:57] was no way, he can still do that.
[1:04:00] If he can put the tax coin in the mouth
[1:04:02] of the fish
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; and then allow the disciples to catch
[1:04:06] the right fish
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; with the right coin
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; to pay the right bill,
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; the right amount, he could still do the
[1:04:13] same.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. He can.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Uh nothing wrong with working for your
[1:04:18] money.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; But even that sometimes is not enough.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; And he can stretch.
[1:04:26] Mark chapter 16 and verse 15. Let me say
[1:04:30] before we forget that next Sunday we
[1:04:34] will after the morning service we will
[1:04:36] gather at the fellowship hall for a
[1:04:39] celebration of thanksgiving and we will
[1:04:42] have a meal either later today or
[1:04:44] tomorrow. My wife will put out the the
[1:04:46] list and you can sign up for what you
[1:04:48] want to bring. And we were supposed to
[1:04:51] do it this Sunday, but so many things
[1:04:54] happened with the funeral in Minnesota
[1:04:55] one week, the wedding in Indiana the
[1:04:57] next week. We just didn't get it put
[1:04:59] together in time. We wanted to have a
[1:05:02] little space between because we knew you
[1:05:04] do a lot of Thanksgiving celebrations
[1:05:06] and you might be tired of that kind of
[1:05:09] food. Too bad.
[1:05:12] Next Sunday we will celebrate together.
[1:05:15] &gt;&gt; Uh someone said, "Well, you could just
[1:05:17] skip it." Well, there's a lot of things
[1:05:19] we can skip. We can skip your birthday
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; and mine, but we're not going to miss
[1:05:25] giving God thanks.
[1:05:28] &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, "Go ye into all
[1:05:33] the world,
[1:05:35] and preach the good news,
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; the gospel,
[1:05:39] &gt;&gt; that Jesus is alive
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; to every creature."
[1:05:45] every creature.
[1:05:48] Notice the word, he that believeth
[1:05:52] and is baptized.
[1:05:54] This isn't the apostles talking or the
[1:05:57] church leadership talking.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; This is our Lord.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; You have to act on your belief. You must
[1:06:05] do something to act to obey what you
[1:06:09] believe.
[1:06:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; We look at the ABCs of the faith. accept
[1:06:14] Christ. That's the A. B is believe.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; And C is what?
[1:06:19] &gt;&gt; Confess him.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; You've got to do something here in
[1:06:24] cooperation, in participation. Not that
[1:06:27] that is what saves you. His blood, his
[1:06:30] grace saves us. But we accept it by
[1:06:34] doing it.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Did you follow me?
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; And so he that believeth and is baptized
[1:06:41] shall be saved. But he that believeth
[1:06:43] not shall be damned. Doesn't matter how
[1:06:46] many times he's baptized.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; If he doesn't believe,
[1:06:51] then these signs and these signs
[1:06:57] among others
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; shall follow them
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; that believe.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; The secession movement says, well,
[1:07:05] [snorts] yes, he did this in the
[1:07:06] formation of the early church, but he he
[1:07:09] doesn't do it again. And this is another
[1:07:11] dispensation. This is another uh a time
[1:07:14] of church history. The administration is
[1:07:17] different. I don't believe that
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; to me. He's Hebrews 13:8
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; the same yesterday and today and
[1:07:23] forever. And these signs shall follow
[1:07:26] them that believe
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; in my name.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; In my name, the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:07:33] Christ, Yeshua, our Messiah.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; In my name shall they cast out devils.
[1:07:39] Anybody
[1:07:42] know that there are devils that need to
[1:07:44] go?
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; They shall speak
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; with new tongues.
[1:07:51] They will sometimes speak a language
[1:07:55] that they have never been taught.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Sometimes it might be a known language
[1:08:01] to other men. And the scripture said
[1:08:04] sometimes it might be the tongues of
[1:08:06] angels,
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; heavenly languages,
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; but one of the signs of believing and
[1:08:12] being baptized and being saved as a
[1:08:15] believer is that in my name, he said,
[1:08:18] they'll cast out devils. They shall
[1:08:21] speak with new tongues.
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; They shall take up serpents. And if they
[1:08:26] drink any deadly thing, it shall not
[1:08:31] hurt them. They shall lay hands on the
[1:08:34] sick
[1:08:36] &gt;&gt; and they shall recover.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; You may not recognize the sovereignty of
[1:08:41] God here, but the sovereignty of God is
[1:08:44] shining in Mark chapter 16. Amen.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Because if you take up a serpent, it
[1:08:50] says they shall. But if you should take
[1:08:54] up a serpent like the apostle did,
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; God has the power and authority that you
[1:09:01] might just shake that viper off.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture said.
[1:09:06] And uh I don't think we should be
[1:09:08] tempting or testing or you know I know
[1:09:11] in Appalachia there were those who drank
[1:09:13] a little strict nine and put their hand
[1:09:16] on the fire and took up a rattlesnake.
[1:09:18] Oh no no no no.
[1:09:23] Being a holy roller myself I know what
[1:09:25] it means to be accused of these things
[1:09:27] but I've never been guilty. Amen.
[1:09:30] &gt;&gt; But if I had if I should be in a
[1:09:32] situation where I had to protect someone
[1:09:34] else or something else, wouldn't you
[1:09:37] want to believe for the faith to grab
[1:09:38] that serpent and throw it away?
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "This sounds too
[1:09:42] supernatural." There you go.
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; There you go. We serve a supernatural
[1:09:47] God.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; They shall take up sallall not hurt
[1:09:51] them. They shall lay hands on the sick
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; and they shall recover. Has anybody ever
[1:09:56] seen in your Christian life any of these
[1:09:59] signs performed in your life or someone
[1:10:01] else's life? I have.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; I have.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; I've seen with my own eyes cancerous
[1:10:08] tumors fall off,
[1:10:10] &gt;&gt; broken bones mended.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; Come on, God.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; I've seen what God can do. Unstoppping
[1:10:17] deaf ears.
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. These things, the signs and
[1:10:21] wonders and miracles are not to be the
[1:10:23] emphasis. When you make them the
[1:10:25] emphasis, then it is as though you are
[1:10:29] somehow reducing the main thing.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; The main thing is the gift of salvation
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; through the Lord Jesus Christ. Father,
[1:10:39] we thank you that you do not change.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; And although your seasons and times and
[1:10:47] church ages may change,
[1:10:50] you are ever more the same. And yes, we
[1:10:55] have prayed for those who you chose to
[1:10:58] take, but we always have taken the
[1:11:02] opportunity to remind others and
[1:11:06] ourselves that you're still a healer.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; I've watched you snatch men and women
[1:11:12] from the very jaws of death.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; And I know that you are ever more able
[1:11:18] to do the same. And every time you
[1:11:21] redeem a sinner and bring them out of a
[1:11:24] life of bondage,
[1:11:26] that is a miracle.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; That is a sign. That is a wonder. When
[1:11:31] you break addiction,
[1:11:33] when you heal a marriage, when you
[1:11:36] deliver those who are crippled with
[1:11:40] anxiety,
[1:11:41] these are demonstrations of who you are.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Come to us today. expand our
[1:11:49] understanding as you reveal and make
[1:11:52] yourself known to us and we will glorify
[1:11:55] you. We will exalt you. We will lift you
[1:11:58] up because you have told us that in the
[1:12:01] lifting
[1:12:03] there is a drawing.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; The context is the cross. If I be lifted
[1:12:09] up,
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; but the reality is even beyond 2,000
[1:12:13] years ago. Yes.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; In this hour, if men will lift your name
[1:12:18] and give your word preeminence,
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; there's a drawing power.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; There's a pull that takes place that
[1:12:27] draws us up into who you are. Oh Lord,
[1:12:31] thank you.
[1:12:33] Help us in this time in the name above
[1:12:36] every name. Bashim Adonai Yeshua
[1:12:39] Hamashiach. In the name of the Lord
[1:12:41] Jesus Christ, we pray. And the saints
[1:12:43] said,
[1:12:43] &gt;&gt; "Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; You may be seated."
[1:12:47] In Mark 16,
[1:12:49] two more verses
[1:12:51] 19 and 20. So then after the Lord had
[1:12:55] spoken unto them, this helps us to find
[1:12:58] the context.
[1:12:59] The context is the same context here is
[1:13:04] the same as Acts chapter 1.
[1:13:08] This is the ascension. This is our
[1:13:12] Lord's going up into that other realm.
[1:13:15] His earthly work in a corporal body
[1:13:18] finished for that moment. It says after
[1:13:23] the Lord had spoken unto them, he was
[1:13:27] what? received up into heaven and sat on
[1:13:31] the right hand of God, which is the
[1:13:34] right hand of power and authority,
[1:13:37] the invisible spirit of the eternal the
[1:13:41] eternal spirit, the father manifestation
[1:13:43] of who God is. And he doesn't have a
[1:13:47] human form. When he chose a human form,
[1:13:52] he was the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; Is that what the scripture said? You're
[1:13:56] very familiar with John 1.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; So he's sitting now at the right hand of
[1:14:02] power and authority. And they went
[1:14:05] forth, these who heard the sermon of the
[1:14:09] Lord. They went forth. And what did they
[1:14:12] do? They obeyed what he told them.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; They preached where?
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Everywhere.
[1:14:17] &gt;&gt; Everywhere. Grocery store.
[1:14:20] &gt;&gt; I guess that would have been the shook
[1:14:22] the market.
[1:14:23] the the the tent makers business
[1:14:27] wherever they were, they preached the
[1:14:30] good news, the gospel that Jesus Christ
[1:14:34] has the power to change lives.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; To deliver the oppressed, the Luke 4
[1:14:41] commission, which is the fulfillment of
[1:14:43] Isaiah's prophecy, the spirit of the
[1:14:45] Lord is upon me. Amen. And this day, he
[1:14:49] said, this scripture is fulfilled in
[1:14:53] your ears. It's fleshed out the promise
[1:14:57] of one who would come and set captives
[1:15:00] free, give sight to the blind, open
[1:15:02] prison doors, bring healing to the
[1:15:05] bruised and the afflicted. This was the
[1:15:07] prophecy of Isaiah. And our Lord is
[1:15:10] standing there that day reading as was
[1:15:13] his turn to read. H he's reading the
[1:15:16] very prophecy of himself
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; by God's design.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; And when he finished, he's supposed to
[1:15:24] go and sit down and be extremely quiet
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; because there will be another reading to
[1:15:29] follow in second temple period synagogue
[1:15:32] worship. But instead, as he goes back to
[1:15:36] sit down, he speaks out and he says,
[1:15:39] "This day, this scripture is fulfilled
[1:15:43] in your ears. What Isaiah prophesied 700
[1:15:47] years before has now become a fleshed
[1:15:50] out,
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; a fleshed out reality." That promise is
[1:15:54] walking around.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. among you today. That's a what
[1:16:00] a powerful thing for him to say.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; And they began to marvel. Is this
[1:16:06] Joseph's son? Isn't this one of the
[1:16:09] hometown boys?
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Well, something has happened to him.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; There's an authority in his words.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; I guess there is.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; This was who he was.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; The word made flesh,
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; dwelling among men. Can you say amen?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they preached with the Lord
[1:16:30] doing what?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Confirm.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; The Lord was working with them.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; I I thought the Lord was just caught up
[1:16:40] into heaven.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Did Didn't it say he was received up
[1:16:44] into heaven? And now it says those
[1:16:47] apostles, they went out and they began
[1:16:50] to preach the good news of the gospel.
[1:16:52] And somehow there was cooperation.
[1:16:55] from another dimension.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Jesus, who had been received up into the
[1:17:01] heavens, now positioned at the right
[1:17:03] hand of power and authority, was somehow
[1:17:07] working with his representatives on the
[1:17:09] earth. He was working with them.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; How many of you would find that a
[1:17:14] privilege
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; to be working with the Lord? WELL, THE
[1:17:18] APOSTLE PAUL tells us in more than one
[1:17:21] epistle that that's exactly what we must
[1:17:24] do.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; We are to participate with him in the
[1:17:28] works of redemption.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; He has given us a ministry of what?
[1:17:34] Reconciliation.
[1:17:35] &gt;&gt; And he has called us to be
[1:17:38] co-articipants.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; With him in the works of redemption. Oh
[1:17:43] my. And though we don't see him in the
[1:17:46] physical body that he dwelt among men
[1:17:49] in, we know he's here.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus is here.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; How How can you say such a thing?
[1:17:57] Because he lives in us.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; What is this? Who is this living? It's
[1:18:04] him. It's his spirit. It's his life now
[1:18:07] living in us. And the Lord was working
[1:18:10] with them as they went forth and
[1:18:11] preached everywhere the gospel. And
[1:18:13] guess what else he did?
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; He was confirming the word.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; How many of you know what the word amen
[1:18:22] means?
[1:18:23] &gt;&gt; It means so be it.
[1:18:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; Every time you hear a promise and you
[1:18:29] say or uh think, but you you can't help
[1:18:33] the preacher, encourage the preacher by
[1:18:35] thinking amen.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; But you can encourage the preacher by
[1:18:40] saying an amen. Amen.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; And that's the power of agreement.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; When you say amen to the word, you're
[1:18:47] not only saying that is the truth,
[1:18:48] you're saying something else.
[1:18:50] &gt;&gt; You're saying that's my truth.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; I have heard it. I have believed it.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; I have received it as my truth. This is
[1:19:00] not just information to me. It has been
[1:19:03] quickened. It has been given life.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; And I believe it. It's now a part of who
[1:19:08] I am. Amen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; That very life of God. The the apostle
[1:19:13] said the life that we now live, it's not
[1:19:16] the natural life that we received
[1:19:19] through the birth of our mother.
[1:19:23] That's not the life that a believer is
[1:19:25] living anymore.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; You you may not understand that your
[1:19:29] life source has changed. But when you
[1:19:32] become a new creature in Christ, your
[1:19:34] life source changes
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; and you are no longer living the natural
[1:19:39] life that you once lived courtesy of
[1:19:42] your mother, your father, and the gift
[1:19:43] of God, his breath.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; You're now living another life. The life
[1:19:47] that I now live is not my own. He said,
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; but it is the life.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; It is the life of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; It is his life. It is his spirit. It is
[1:20:00] his quickening power
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; now living in us.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; So he's not only working with us and
[1:20:10] we're working with him. Somebody said,
[1:20:11] "No, no, no. This was only to the
[1:20:15] original 12." You know how I know that's
[1:20:17] not true? Because they were already
[1:20:20] dropping off.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Some already had to be replaced. That's
[1:20:27] why they were gathered together in Acts
[1:20:29] chapter 1 in the upper room.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; They were gathered there to conduct the
[1:20:33] business of the kingdom which was very
[1:20:35] small at the time.
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; And there were some disciples that had
[1:20:39] to be replaced.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; So now if it was only to the original
[1:20:42] apostles and now there are at least two
[1:20:45] that need to be repositioned and that
[1:20:47] would happen many times down the way. Uh
[1:20:50] and and and so are you saying then that
[1:20:52] only the original or are you saying only
[1:20:55] the successors of the original can have
[1:20:57] this? Or would you believe that the
[1:21:00] scripture is careful to tell us that if
[1:21:03] we accept this truth and believe it
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; and act on it,
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; we can also receive the same authority.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; So there was no ceasing. I want you to
[1:21:14] know there was no ceasing of God's power
[1:21:17] and ability. He doesn't diminish.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; He doesn't diminish. He's steady. He's
[1:21:24] rock solid.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; He's faithful. Somebody say faithful.
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; Faithful.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Has there ever been a time that he was
[1:21:31] not faithful? Never.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Because he is he is the word.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; So he is dedicated to the fulfillment
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; of who he is. not what he is,
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; but who he is.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; You'll laugh at me when I tell you that
[1:21:50] I I I spent several hours on Friday
[1:21:55] uh working on one word.
[1:21:59] I I was captured
[1:22:02] by the misplacement
[1:22:04] of a what that should have been a who.
[1:22:10] I I went home and I wanted to
[1:22:13] I I I I love Friday dinner with my
[1:22:17] family, those who who got to be with us
[1:22:21] and but I was still under the influence.
[1:22:27] Have you ever been in a moment of
[1:22:29] studying God's word that you find
[1:22:32] yourself under an inspiration?
[1:22:35] Something otherworldly.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; That's how it's supposed to be. Oh yes,
[1:22:39] for preachers. No, for believers.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; You can have that atmosphere.
[1:22:45] &gt;&gt; A and I don't have it every time I read
[1:22:48] or every time I study,
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; but when he comes in a particular way to
[1:22:53] to put a little more Isav,
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; a little more isav in my eyes that I
[1:23:00] could see a little brighter and a little
[1:23:02] clearer. And uh I've told you about
[1:23:04] these floaters. How many of you have
[1:23:06] ever dealt with floaters in your eyes?
[1:23:08] Well, I I'm tired of mine. I'm ready for
[1:23:10] them to go.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm tired of swatting what's not
[1:23:14] there.
[1:23:15] &gt;&gt; And they're constantly moving because
[1:23:17] your eyes constantly moving. And said,
[1:23:19] "Well, hold your head steady." Well,
[1:23:20] that don't mean your eye will stay
[1:23:22] steady.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Come on. So, when when your your eyes,
[1:23:27] you know, when that happens to me and I
[1:23:29] realize it's a floater, I will find
[1:23:31] myself doing like this. Well, that
[1:23:32] doesn't change the floater.
[1:23:35] But somehow it helps you to feel a
[1:23:38] little better
[1:23:39] and sometimes you notice it less when
[1:23:42] when when your vision is is dim. When
[1:23:46] you first wake up in the morning, maybe
[1:23:47] you're not seeing quite as clear as you
[1:23:50] will when you wash your face real good.
[1:23:52] That's still a good idea.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; Uh and you're and and and here's another
[1:23:58] one. When when you're when you're trying
[1:24:00] to read something in fine print without
[1:24:03] your glasses and your eyes are wearing
[1:24:06] out a little and and you're trying to
[1:24:09] adjust your head to see it better,
[1:24:11] instead of putting your glasses on, you
[1:24:13] put your glasses on, say, "Wow,
[1:24:17] there are words on that page."
[1:24:20] When God puts a little of that is sav
[1:24:24] &gt;&gt; spiritually in our eye
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; and we say it's more than just a blur to
[1:24:28] me now.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; It's getting clearer all the time.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; And we can only be transformed by what's
[1:24:36] clear to us.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Now, I know there's this theme around
[1:24:40] the movement that says, you know, just
[1:24:42] believe it anyway. Believe it anyway.
[1:24:43] Well, you can try that.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; You can try that. But I want you to know
[1:24:48] that that kind of belief, a blind belief
[1:24:51] will be tested
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; and tested
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; and tested.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; But once it becomes a reality, a living
[1:24:59] revelation to you, are you telling me
[1:25:02] that God has obligated himself to make
[1:25:04] his word a living revelation or reality
[1:25:08] to me as an individual, a non-pastor, a
[1:25:11] non- preacher,
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; to all of us?
[1:25:15] He wants you to see him.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; And the way that he reveals himself in
[1:25:20] this hour is through enlightened.
[1:25:24] Through enlightenment,
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; enlightenment.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; When the word becomes all of a sudden
[1:25:31] bright in your inner being. And you say,
[1:25:33] "Wait a minute."
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; And so the Lord and I, we went round and
[1:25:38] round and round about a a what that
[1:25:41] should have been a who. And you say that
[1:25:43] couldn't possibly make a difference. I
[1:25:46] want you to just think for a moment. I'm
[1:25:47] not going to speak this today, but I
[1:25:49] want you to think for just a moment. Uh
[1:25:52] uh uh the the the it's it's a neutral
[1:25:56] it's a neutral word. What?
[1:26:00] But but who is a personal expression
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; or whom?
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. meaning not pertaining to an
[1:26:10] object but of
[1:26:14] &gt;&gt; an object. And you would be surprised
[1:26:17] how clarity can come in the
[1:26:19] understanding of the godhead
[1:26:22] when you recognize that in some
[1:26:25] situations a what could have been.
[1:26:29] Should have been.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Are you going to tell me should have
[1:26:32] been? I just did. Should have been a
[1:26:35] who. [clears throat]
[1:26:36] Because what a lot of people don't know
[1:26:38] about your King James version Bible is
[1:26:40] that there are italicized words
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; in the verse.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; You you can look in your Bible. I don't
[1:26:47] know if it shows up that way in the in
[1:26:49] the apps or not. I've never really
[1:26:51] looked at it that close. Does it? They
[1:26:53] say it does. There are atalicized words.
[1:26:57] And when you're looking at a literal
[1:26:58] translation of the verse, there will it
[1:27:01] won't make a whole lot of sense.
[1:27:02] Sometimes it'll be reversed. the words
[1:27:05] will be reversed. And so the translators
[1:27:09] put in it atalicized letters words that
[1:27:13] were added
[1:27:17] for clarity.
[1:27:19] Don't panic.
[1:27:21] You needed a two to o. You needed an a.
[1:27:27] You needed a who. You needed a what. You
[1:27:29] needed a that. You needed a whom.
[1:27:33] Because if you're only looking at the
[1:27:35] major words in a verse of scripture, it
[1:27:38] sometimes would really I don't think
[1:27:41] people would read it that way very
[1:27:42] often. They just say, "I just can't get
[1:27:44] through it."
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; So, we're not in any way criticizing.
[1:27:47] This is this is a beautiful thing,
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; but it's not so beautiful to me when you
[1:27:54] see an italicized word and by the
[1:27:57] discretion of the translator, they made
[1:27:59] it a what? when it should have been a
[1:28:03] who. And that would be determined by the
[1:28:06] subject.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; What are we talking about? Who are we?
[1:28:10] Are we talking ABOUT A WHAT? ARE WE
[1:28:13] talking about a table? Are we talking
[1:28:15] about a gift on the table? Or are we
[1:28:17] talking about a whom?
[1:28:20] &gt;&gt; And I want you to know, we're referring
[1:28:23] today to a who, a whom,
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; a personal. A person, not a thing. The
[1:28:30] Holy Spirit is not a what,
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; is not,
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; nor is he an it,
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; but a whom.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; And when Jesus is talking, it can make
[1:28:41] such a difference when you understand
[1:28:43] that that spirit didn't come as an
[1:28:47] article, as a what, as as a a an an
[1:28:51] object. It came as a person.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. the life he said uh that this life
[1:28:58] will be in you.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; And if this same life, this same spirit
[1:29:05] that raised Jesus from the dead, it
[1:29:08] shall also quicken your mortal body
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; if it dwell in you.
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; And that's not a what.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; THAT SPIRIT IS A WHO.
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; It's a whom. YEAH,
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S THE same spirit.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Like Jesus said, you've seen me. You
[1:29:28] have also seen the father
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; because he resides in me.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't think I cannot believe
[1:29:35] you have spent 15 minutes on what's and
[1:29:37] whose." And you're not even going to
[1:29:38] give us the punchline. Hold on. It'll
[1:29:40] come.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; But you'd be surprised the tail spin you
[1:29:44] can get in and you're thinking, "My my
[1:29:46] if just a what if just a who would have
[1:29:48] been chosen in a talis?
[1:29:54] I think it would have been a lot easier
[1:29:56] to understand that this is not another
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; right
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; but the same.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; Anybody can get a little confused on
[1:30:04] that. You'll see that in a moment.
[1:30:08] I want to read another portion of
[1:30:10] scripture to you in Luke chap 10 and
[1:30:13] verse 19. And I know what is happening
[1:30:16] to the time.
[1:30:18] Behold, I red letter again. Behold, I
[1:30:24] give unto
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; you. Now, is he talking only to those in
[1:30:28] hearing,
[1:30:30] in person,
[1:30:33] in presence,
[1:30:35] or is he talking about to all who hear?
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; And for as long as they shall hear,
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; that's whosoever will. Yes.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Behold, I give unto you
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; power
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; to tread on. Now, I like this. I'm not
[1:30:56] I'm not going to be taking them up.
[1:30:57] Don't worry.
[1:30:59] &gt;&gt; But I like to walk on them.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Behold, I give unto you power to tread
[1:31:04] on serpents and scorpions
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; and over
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; all the power
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; of the enemy. And nothing,
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; no nothing,
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; that's what nothing is. No thing and
[1:31:18] nothing shall by
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; any means
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; hurt you.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Now, that doesn't mean you won't have
[1:31:25] hurt.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean you won't have pain.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Greley told us last week, you're
[1:31:31] you're being pressed,
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; but for a purpose.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; The dye is being cast.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; You're being pressed into the mold.
[1:31:41] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; So that you come out.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, an et t.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; You've got to come out an
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; a smaller version of
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; that's what the word says.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, that's not new age. That's not new
[1:31:57] apostolic reformation.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; That's the Bible.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; That's what the scripture tells us.
[1:32:03] Behold, I give unto you power. Tread on
[1:32:05] serpents and scorpions and over all the
[1:32:07] power of the enemy. Nothing, no nothing
[1:32:09] shall by any means hurt you.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; The Amplified says it this way, "Behold,
[1:32:15] I have given. I have given."
[1:32:20] [clears throat]
[1:32:20] Because that really is the tense of the
[1:32:24] Greek that is used here. I have, meaning
[1:32:29] the power has been secured.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; I don't have to go get this power. It's
[1:32:35] already gotten.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying, "I have it
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; and now I have given it to you. I have
[1:32:44] given you." And I love this. I love the
[1:32:47] fact that both expressions of the
[1:32:50] English word power are used here. Both
[1:32:52] meanings,
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; I have given you authority,
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; which is exusia,
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; and I have given you power.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Which is dunamis. I've given you
[1:33:04] authority and power to trample upon
[1:33:06] serpents and scorpions and physical and
[1:33:09] mental strength and ability over all the
[1:33:12] power that the enemy possesses and
[1:33:16] nothing
[1:33:18] shall in any way harm you.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Now, the harm that is being spoken of
[1:33:22] here is is a harm that we need to
[1:33:26] understand.
[1:33:27] And and the hurt that is here in King
[1:33:30] James is a hurt that we need to
[1:33:32] understand. We're not talking about a
[1:33:34] momentary hurt or a fleeting passing
[1:33:39] harm.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; We're talking about an ultimate hurt.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; An ultimate harm.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "What in the world do you
[1:33:47] mean by that?" Jesus said, "All that the
[1:33:49] father hath given me,
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; wish you'd help me.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; I have them." And he said,
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; "All that the FATHER HAS GIVEN ME, I
[1:33:58] have them. I've inscribed them
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; in the palm of my hand.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; And no man,
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; nothing
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; shall pluck them
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; out of my hand."
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Now, what does the hand represent?
[1:34:20] Power and authority of God.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; I'm holding you. be say saying in the
[1:34:26] power and authority of God I'm holding
[1:34:29] you. Jesus is saying you're in my hand
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; and nothing is ultimately going to be
[1:34:34] able to pull you out of my hand. There's
[1:34:37] only one thing that can separate you and
[1:34:41] our fellowship
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; and that's an act of your will.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; But even that does not change
[1:34:48] relationship
[1:34:50] &gt;&gt; your your mind. Amen.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; You may be running in the other
[1:34:54] direction, but Jesus said,
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; "You're mine."
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; You may have slid in and slid out and
[1:35:02] slid in and slid out until you don't
[1:35:05] know which which way you're sliding now.
[1:35:08] In or out,
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; up or down? Am I in? Am I out? Am I
[1:35:12] closer to the Lord than I've ever been?
[1:35:13] Am I farther away from the Lord than
[1:35:15] I've ever been? Sometimes there's so
[1:35:17] much movement in our fellowship with him
[1:35:20] that we don't know exactly where we are.
[1:35:22] But here is the key. Yes.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; Whether you're sliding in or whether
[1:35:26] you're sliding out, if you're in his
[1:35:28] hand,
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; whether you've fallen and you can't get
[1:35:33] up, whether you're standing tall and
[1:35:36] straight like a cedar of Lebanon, if
[1:35:40] you're in his hand,
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; you may find temporary hurt. You may
[1:35:46] come in contact with momentary harm
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; but ultimately you won't be harmed.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Ultimately you can't be hurt because no
[1:35:57] man, no disease, NO THING, NO
[1:36:00] CIRCUMSTANCE, NO BAD MARRIAGE,
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; no abusive situation,
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus can pluck you,
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; can remove you from my will, from my
[1:36:11] hand.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; It's the sovereignty of God. Mark 16
[1:36:16] reveals again the sovereignty of God.
[1:36:18] And Luke 10 reveals again the
[1:36:22] sovereignty of God. Doesn't mean if a
[1:36:25] bee uh uh uh stings you, it's not going
[1:36:27] to hurt.
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; Boy, that'd be great.
[1:36:32] We know that by the demonstration of of
[1:36:35] mature love, perfect love,
[1:36:38] that you have some authority over some
[1:36:41] of these kinds of things. We've seen
[1:36:44] demonstrations of it in scripture. And
[1:36:47] one generation ago,
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; hornets,
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; sent in the other direction by
[1:36:56] demonstration of love. You don't really
[1:36:57] believe that, do you? I actually do.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; You're just a fanatic. Thank you very
[1:37:03] much.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; I'd rather be registered among those who
[1:37:06] believe every bit of it.
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; I want to believe it. I want to believe
[1:37:10] every comma. I want to believe every
[1:37:12] every jot. I want to believe every
[1:37:14] title.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; Every vowel mark. I want to believe it
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; because it is the closest expression
[1:37:21] that we have of the reality of who God
[1:37:24] is is revealed in his word until it gets
[1:37:27] in flesh.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; And it's fighting its way back to flesh.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; That was the ultimate goal. What house?
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; What house will you build? Are you
[1:37:37] awake? Yes, sir.
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; I think some of you are. And that's all
[1:37:40] that matters. That's enough. Let's let's
[1:37:41] let's go on. And so it doesn't mean that
[1:37:44] you're you're not going to while my wife
[1:37:46] was minding her own business some years
[1:37:48] ago and and and pulling some dead uh
[1:37:52] dead stems
[1:37:54] off some gerbra daisies in the in the
[1:37:57] garden
[1:37:58] and uh here come a caterpillar.
[1:38:01] If you've ever seen these caterpillars
[1:38:04] with a green blanket on, it looks
[1:38:07] painted. It doesn't even look real. It
[1:38:09] don't move like a real thing. And she
[1:38:13] didn't even know she had come in contact
[1:38:14] with it, but her body knew it.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; And she became ill in a hurry. The pain
[1:38:20] severe in a hurry. And and all of a
[1:38:25] sudden, it had come.
[1:38:28] I never heard her say one time, "God
[1:38:30] doesn't love me. The word don't work."
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:38:34] When I when I hit my toe on the end of
[1:38:37] the bed uh on my way back from the
[1:38:40] bathroom,
[1:38:43] I never get THIS THOUGHT. IF GOD JUST
[1:38:46] LOVED ME MORE, that wouldn't even hurt.
[1:38:49] The Bible said no hurt would come. This
[1:38:52] is not what he said.
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; There's going to be trials.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; There's going to be beastings.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Anybody here?
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; THERE'S GOING TO BE FLAT TIRES.
[1:39:02] YES,
[1:39:04] &gt;&gt; there's going to be viruses and and and
[1:39:07] uh all kinds of things that are going
[1:39:10] headaches.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; I would have never created one. Would
[1:39:14] you?
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY'RE GOING TO COME. THAT DOESN'T
[1:39:17] MEAN no harm, no hurt, no test, no
[1:39:20] trial. It means ultimately
[1:39:23] nothing,
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; is going to be able to take you out
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; of your relationship
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; with redemption.
[1:39:32] Some things affect fellowship.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; Laying out a church will affect your
[1:39:36] fellowship.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; Robbing God in your tithe will affect
[1:39:39] your fellowship.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; But it doesn't change your relationship.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; You've been engraved. Oh my. I remember
[1:39:46] the old time preacher, I heard it with
[1:39:48] my own ears, who was preaching one night
[1:39:50] on having your name engraved in the hand
[1:39:53] of God like the Old Testament speaks
[1:39:54] about. And it dawned on him. He he said
[1:39:59] he was had been in the service and he
[1:40:01] was a holiness preacher and he wasn't
[1:40:03] one of those modern tattoo Christians,
[1:40:06] you know, who comes to the Lord and and
[1:40:08] still wants to put all this ink on their
[1:40:10] body. But he had this. He had it in the
[1:40:13] service. He wasn't serving the Lord. He
[1:40:15] kept the best he could. It covered up
[1:40:18] and you can't always do that, but he
[1:40:20] did. and and and and he thought every
[1:40:24] time he said every time I'm dressing I
[1:40:26] remember
[1:40:28] that to me he said to me I remember what
[1:40:31] I was doing under what influence I was
[1:40:34] under
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; when I put that anchor on my arm
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; I wasn't sober
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; I wasn't living a good clean circumspect
[1:40:43] upright life
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; and every time I see that it doesn't
[1:40:46] drag me back there
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; but it reminds me Yeah.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Would I get rid of it if I could? He
[1:40:53] said, "I would, but I I that's beyond me
[1:40:56] now to make that happen. So, I just I
[1:40:58] just cover it up."
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; This is the same thought.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; He's preaching on a little longer and he
[1:41:05] talks about my name is engraved in God's
[1:41:08] hand. He said, "No matter what I do, I
[1:41:10] can't forget uh that I had another life.
[1:41:12] There was an old man that lived in me
[1:41:14] cuz I look down and I see it on my arm."
[1:41:16] But in the same manner,
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; God can never forget me.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; He said, I just thought of this. He said
[1:41:23] he couldn't forget me if he wanted to.
[1:41:25] He doesn't want to, but if he wanted to,
[1:41:27] HE COULDN'T BECAUSE HE'S ALREADY
[1:41:29] engraved me.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; AND EVERY time he moves his hand, he
[1:41:36] remembers me.
[1:41:38] &gt;&gt; This is metaphorically, but I'll tell
[1:41:40] you to those of us who know better, it
[1:41:42] is reality.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. He cannot forget us.
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; He cannot forget the backslider.
[1:41:51] &gt;&gt; The scripture said so.
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; So fellowship's broken but relationship
[1:41:55] remains the same. Now
[1:41:58] when we look at the word power in Luke
[1:42:01] 10:19, "Behold, I give unto you power
[1:42:06] to tread on serpents and scorpions and
[1:42:08] so forth." Would Wouldn't that sound to
[1:42:11] you like dunamis?
[1:42:13] It sounds like dynamite.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; That's where we get our dynamite from.
[1:42:17] The Greek word dunamis, which is
[1:42:19] explosive, strength,
[1:42:22] capability.
[1:42:24] Uh, and I'll give you a few other words
[1:42:27] to go along with it in a moment. I'm not
[1:42:29] quite ready for that, but hold it close.
[1:42:34] Uh you would think that that was
[1:42:39] power from the Greek word dunamis, but
[1:42:42] what you find out is that it's power
[1:42:45] from the Greek word exusia.
[1:42:48] And I want you to look now at the at the
[1:42:52] uh from the lexicon
[1:42:54] what exusia means because Jesus said,
[1:42:59] "Behold, I give unto you exusia."
[1:43:02] translated here as power. Authority is
[1:43:06] the meaning. I give you authority to
[1:43:10] tread on serpents and scorpions and over
[1:43:13] all the power of the enemy. Authority.
[1:43:15] Somebody say authority.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; It means right. Having the right to act.
[1:43:23] Jurisdiction. I like that.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; God said, "I'm giving you jurisdiction
[1:43:28] over all the powers of the enemy."
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:32] THEY MAY SERVE ANOTHER MASTER,
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; BUT I'M giving you authority over
[1:43:37] somebody else's servant.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you power over serpents and
[1:43:43] scorpions.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; I'm giving you jurisdiction. I'm giving
[1:43:47] you permission to act.
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; It's the ability or strength with which
[1:43:52] one is
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; endued.
[1:43:57] &gt;&gt; Does that remind you of anything? Acts
[1:43:59] one.
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Try here in Jerusalem until
[1:44:02] you be
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; endued.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Endued
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; with power from on high. I'll show you
[1:44:09] that one in a minute.
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; Endued.
[1:44:13] One who possesses authority. The sign of
[1:44:17] regal authority. That's royal.
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; And I like this one. This is my favorite
[1:44:22] of of all the definitions.
[1:44:26] Exercising a state of control over
[1:44:29] something by legal rights.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Somebody say power of attorney.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Power of attorney.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; You can have a power of attorney. Of
[1:44:40] attorney.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Power of eternity. Yes. That's right.
[1:44:43] Too. You can have power of attorney.
[1:44:46] legal rights to conduct business in the
[1:44:49] name of the person, the grtor,
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; the one who has granted you the legal
[1:44:55] rights to act on his or her behalf. My
[1:45:00] if Jesus is saying
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; please, please follow this. If Jesus is
[1:45:05] saying, I give unto you a state of
[1:45:08] control over something by legal rights
[1:45:13] because we know the whole universe,
[1:45:15] everything that God created is operating
[1:45:18] under a legal system.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; It is. It's a judicial system.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; It's not earth's legal system.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; It's not earth's judicial system. It's
[1:45:29] the legal system of the kingdom.
[1:45:31] I went through weeks of that with you.
[1:45:35] There's no doubt in my mind that there
[1:45:38] is an ancient of days.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; There is one who sits with a white wig.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; We see him in the book of the
[1:45:45] Revelation, HAIR WHITE LIKE SNOW, the
[1:45:48] glorified Christ. We see him as the as
[1:45:51] the wigged one also as the ancient of
[1:45:54] days in the book of Daniel. And he has
[1:45:57] the THE THE THE AUTHORITY, NOT ONLY THE
[1:46:00] POWER and ability, HE HAS THE AUTHORITY
[1:46:03] TO EXECUTE JUSTICE
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR LIFE.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; And all you have to do is beseech him.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. request,
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; God,
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; ask
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; and it shall be
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; a judgment, a justice, a just decision
[1:46:26] rendered from the legal system of the
[1:46:29] kingdom. And so anything that happens in
[1:46:31] earth under the jurisdiction of a legal
[1:46:33] system is some earthly imitation
[1:46:37] of something that is not based on
[1:46:40] opinion. You you you you understand that
[1:46:42] a the our legal system can can uh of
[1:46:47] course it's based on the law, but it can
[1:46:49] also be greatly influenced
[1:46:53] by the opinions and the politics and the
[1:46:57] convictions of the judge or jurors.
[1:47:00] We know that they have to act within the
[1:47:02] law, but they're given sort of a, you
[1:47:05] know, a little flow here and and uh to
[1:47:09] move and sometimes in ways that that our
[1:47:12] constitution never intended for it to be
[1:47:14] used. You can say amen or you don't have
[1:47:16] to say anything but you can rest assure
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; that there's a higher
[1:47:22] a higher legal system
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; a higher system of justice
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; OH THAT'S EXECUTED BY the ancient of
[1:47:29] days
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; and when he renders a just decision this
[1:47:36] is boy
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; I I tell you when we were children in
[1:47:42] the Pentecostal church they called it
[1:47:44] praying through. You pray until you know
[1:47:47] that God has heard you. Well, he heard
[1:47:49] you when you started.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; And he knew the need before you told
[1:47:54] him.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; We got all that. Amen.
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; But when that burden begins to lift a
[1:47:59] little bit
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; and faith begins to take a hold, we call
[1:48:03] that praying through.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; But I want you to know it's more than
[1:48:06] that. When that burden begin to lift and
[1:48:09] some joy comes and some peace comes in a
[1:48:11] situation that's got you out of your
[1:48:13] mind. When you feel that, I want you to
[1:48:16] know it's because there's one above it
[1:48:19] all who has rendered
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; a just decision
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; on your behalf,
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; not in any court authority,
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; the authority of authorities,
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; the power of all powers,
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; king of kings and lord of lords, the
[1:48:39] chief AND ULTIMATE POTENTATE OF THE
[1:48:42] ENTIRE UNIVERSE. HE IS ALL AUTHORITY.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; And when he says enough,
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; sometimes he's saying, "Hold on. It's
[1:48:52] coming.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; That'll do." Have you ever had that
[1:48:56] sense of peace that says, "Hold on.
[1:48:58] It'll it'll change."
[1:48:59] &gt;&gt; Hold on.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; That'll do. But once YOU GET THAT PLACE,
[1:49:04] THAT PLACE of faith and you know that
[1:49:06] you know that you know no, you don't
[1:49:08] know how the details are going to pan
[1:49:09] out and you don't know how the
[1:49:11] circumstances are going to bring the
[1:49:12] ultimate goal into reality. But you know
[1:49:15] that you know that you know THAT YOU
[1:49:18] KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THAT 5 MINUTES AGO
[1:49:20] YOU FELT ALL ALONE AND you were carrying
[1:49:22] the weight OF THE BURDEN ALL BY
[1:49:24] [screaming] YOURSELF
[1:49:26] &gt;&gt; AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU HAVE FELT THE
[1:49:28] STRENGTH OF THE LORD AS HE AS HE PUT HIS
[1:49:30] SHOULDER UNDERNEATH YOUR LOAD, YOUR
[1:49:33] WEIGHT, YOUR burden
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; and it be to get lighter.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; He did it for me Thursday. Amen.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; He just put his shoulder under the load.
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "You don't have to carry this
[1:49:47] any longer.
[1:49:49] &gt;&gt; I died
[1:49:51] and I live again."
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; In the atonement, which is to make us at
[1:49:57] one with him.
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; It's union. The purpose of atonement was
[1:50:01] always more than a blood liel.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; It was always more. The purpose of the
[1:50:10] offering system of the Old Testament was
[1:50:12] way more than than a blood sacrifice.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; It was legal.
[1:50:21] &gt;&gt; It was it was just and it was to bring
[1:50:24] us to a place where we are at union at
[1:50:28] [clears throat] onement
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; with him.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:32] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Somebody said are there are
[1:50:34] there scriptures? Oh my. Are there
[1:50:36] scriptures? But she have received the
[1:50:38] mind of Christ.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; Is that a scripture?
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Is that a good scripture?
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; They're all good.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; To have the mind of Christ
[1:50:49] to to have the discernment of Christ.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; To know what Christ knows
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; and see IT THE WAY CHRIST SEES IT.
[1:50:59] &gt;&gt; Somebody said maybe a glimpse. Yes,
[1:51:01] maybe a glimpse here and maybe a glimpse
[1:51:03] there, but not always a glimpse
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; because plain view,
[1:51:10] clear vision,
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; yes, sir,
[1:51:11] &gt;&gt; has been promised
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; to the believer
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; as the last church age.
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Comes to a close.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Time no more.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; Eternity breaking forth.
[1:51:31] Okay. So then it says delegated or
[1:51:34] authorized power. So the reason why the
[1:51:37] word power was chosen here is because it
[1:51:40] can also mean power. But it's not a
[1:51:43] dynamite power, a dunamis power, an
[1:51:45] explosive power. It's a delegated or
[1:51:48] authorized power.
[1:51:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what that means is you could
[1:51:52] read that verse of scripture and instead
[1:51:54] of saying power, you could easily say
[1:51:56] authority
[1:51:58] &gt;&gt; and you would be coming up with
[1:52:02] remember brother Brandham said it's not
[1:52:04] a power. It's not more power we need.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; It's the authority to use the power
[1:52:09] that's already been given.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; shake your neighbor just a little bit.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Wake up. Wake up. He ain't done yet. Not
[1:52:19] quite.
[1:52:20] It could easily read authority. Now,
[1:52:24] will you will you put up my numbers for
[1:52:26] me there? I I want to show the people.
[1:52:29] This is this is for some of you totally
[1:52:34] boring.
[1:52:35] For me,
[1:52:38] it's like
[1:52:40] I don't know. It's like liquid life in
[1:52:42] me. I don't know how to describe it.
[1:52:45] It tells us that this word exusia which
[1:52:49] is 1849 in the Strongs comes from the
[1:52:53] Greek number 1832.
[1:52:56] And those those little uh parentheses
[1:53:00] and the numbers in the parenthesis tells
[1:53:03] us exactly how many times the word
[1:53:08] exusia,
[1:53:09] delegated power, delegated authority has
[1:53:13] been translated in English in King James
[1:53:16] as the word that precedes the
[1:53:19] parenthesis. For instance, exusia
[1:53:21] appears as the word authorities in the
[1:53:25] plural seven times.
[1:53:27] It appears you would know that it's you
[1:53:30] wouldn't know that it's delegated power.
[1:53:35] You would just perhaps read it as power.
[1:53:39] But this shows us that there were times
[1:53:42] that translators said, "No, I think that
[1:53:45] uh authorities in the plural fits this
[1:53:49] context better." Seven times in the
[1:53:51] plural, 64 times in the singular, one
[1:53:54] time it was translated as the word
[1:53:56] charge,
[1:53:59] one time it was translated as the word
[1:54:02] control, two times as the word domain.
[1:54:06] So now we've already got one, two,
[1:54:08] three, four, five ways that one Greek
[1:54:12] word exusia is translated.
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; Then we go on to freedom. Once I like
[1:54:18] that
[1:54:20] and then once the word jurisdiction
[1:54:24] and 13 little times
[1:54:30] it's translated power.
[1:54:33] So, you may be reading along and you may
[1:54:35] see that word power and you may think
[1:54:37] you've got a package of dynamite. God's
[1:54:40] handing you dynamite to do something
[1:54:41] with dunamis.
[1:54:44] But what you need to understand is God
[1:54:46] not only has the explosive power,
[1:54:50] &gt;&gt; he also has full authority.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; To commission you,
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; to use that explosive power.
[1:54:59] You do understand that the kingdom
[1:55:01] operates not by power,
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; not by might,
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; but by my spirit,
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; by my jurisdiction,
[1:55:12] &gt;&gt; by my breath,
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; says the Lord.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; So, there's something more important
[1:55:18] than power.
[1:55:19] &gt;&gt; Power is ours. He paid the price. You
[1:55:22] can you can get the beaver dam out of
[1:55:24] your way. You can you can get rid of the
[1:55:27] log jam.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; You can you can get things flowing again
[1:55:31] by using dunamis power. But brother, you
[1:55:34] can only do that because you have
[1:55:36] already been given exusia authority.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's good.
[1:55:41] &gt;&gt; That's what the whole spirit of adoption
[1:55:43] is about.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; The scripture talks about not just
[1:55:46] adoption, the spirit of adoption. Twice
[1:55:49] in the New Testament, it's by the spirit
[1:55:51] of adoption
[1:55:53] &gt;&gt; that we cry what?
[1:55:55] Papa
[1:55:57] abba papa
[1:56:00] is like saying dada
[1:56:03] my dear dad
[1:56:06] daddy
[1:56:07] papa aba it's powerful it's important
[1:56:12] and then one 13 times it says power once
[1:56:16] powers in the plural and then a right
[1:56:20] I've given you the right all exusia 11
[1:56:24] times
[1:56:25] So altogether the word is used 102
[1:56:28] times. If you research, some researchers
[1:56:31] will say 102, some will say 103. You you
[1:56:35] can choose which one you believe. But I
[1:56:38] I think because I looked at the last one
[1:56:42] uh and and it it didn't seem to be I
[1:56:45] couldn't find how that would would
[1:56:47] actually fit. So I'm not sure that that
[1:56:49] was exusia. The whole 102 times in the
[1:56:53] Greek the word was exusia more or less
[1:56:56] delegated authority.
[1:56:58] 88 times out of the 102 it's translated
[1:57:03] under under the umbrella of authority,
[1:57:06] the legal right, the delegated power,
[1:57:11] the delegated jurisdiction to move, to
[1:57:15] act, to believe, to obey. And only 14
[1:57:19] times is it actually referring to power.
[1:57:22] And in those 14 times, the emphasis is
[1:57:26] not on the explosion power. The emphasis
[1:57:30] is on the administration,
[1:57:33] the delegation,
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; the action
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; of the power.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; Somebody said, "Does that really mean
[1:57:39] anything? Is there any re?" Yes.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. It means something if you're
[1:57:44] studying God's word.
[1:57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Now, look at this. Here's the here's the
[1:57:48] paragraph you were giving me a moment
[1:57:50] ago. This this explains the difference
[1:57:52] between the two. While dunamis refers to
[1:57:55] the ability or might to perform a task,
[1:58:00] the dynamic strength to do it. Dunamis
[1:58:06] exusia is the right
[1:58:09] to use that ability [clears throat] or
[1:58:12] to command others. And that word command
[1:58:14] means to commission others to operate in
[1:58:17] such power. A common illustration which
[1:58:20] you've heard many times is a police
[1:58:22] officer, one not too far removed from a
[1:58:26] Barney F who may not be physically
[1:58:29] strong dunamis but has the exusia, the
[1:58:33] authority
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; from the government to direct traffic
[1:58:38] and people obey. They obey the position,
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; not the person.
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; We respect the position
[1:58:51] whether or not we respect the person
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; and we obey. If that person has the
[1:58:57] position of authority over us, we do
[1:58:59] what we are told as much as possibly can
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; and that little Barney Feist steps out
[1:59:04] in the traffic, he can't even find his
[1:59:07] bullet.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; When he when he leaves it in the gun,
[1:59:13] he he he fires it right down his leg
[1:59:15] into the ground.
[1:59:19] All he's trying to do is pull it out.
[1:59:22] He He's a bumbling, you know, just
[1:59:24] bumbling, fumbling,
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; but he's got a badge.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; They all know him and they know he's a
[1:59:33] pushover.
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; But that badge can mean something.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; So, a little old police officer like
[1:59:38] that steps out and to stop traffic on
[1:59:41] Interstate 85,
[1:59:44] he'll become a hood ornament in a hurry.
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; They'll run him over. You're not big
[1:59:49] enough to stop me. But if you know what
[1:59:52] you're if you know what you ought to
[1:59:53] know, you see that flash.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; He may not even have a uniform on, but
[1:59:59] if you see that flash, it means he's
[2:00:01] operating in the authority to tell you
[2:00:03] to get out of the way, to stop, to move
[2:00:05] lanes, whatever you have to do, he's
[2:00:07] there, and you better do it.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; So listen, folk, it's not more power.
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; IT'S UNDERSTANDING THE AUTHORITY
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; THAT God has given us. It makes a world
[2:00:18] of difference when we're talking about
[2:00:20] what we're talking about. Well, what are
[2:00:22] we talking about? An end time anointing.
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; Now, look at Acts with me quickly, and I
[2:00:27] have a few more minutes. I'm going to
[2:00:28] use them.
[2:00:30] Acts 1 verse 7 and 8. And he said unto
[2:00:33] them, "It is not for you to know the
[2:00:37] times or the seasons which the Father
[2:00:40] hath put in his own power." Now, you
[2:00:43] tell me. We'll go back.
[2:00:46] You tell me.
[2:00:50] It's not for you to know,
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; not for me to know. Times or seasons
[2:00:55] which the father hath put in his own
[2:00:57] power. Is that exusia or is that
[2:01:00] dunamis?
[2:01:02] EXUSIA. EXACTLY RIGHT. ALL OF YOU get an
[2:01:06] A if you said dunamis. No.
[2:01:12] But no answer is wrong when you're brave
[2:01:15] enough to answer in a forum like this
[2:01:19] because we'll get the right answer to
[2:01:20] you if we can find it ourselves. Yes.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; It's in the father's authority
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; to know these things and we know them if
[2:01:31] and when he desires to reveal them to
[2:01:34] us. Is that right?
[2:01:35] &gt;&gt; Why didn't others catch the church ages?
[2:01:38] It was only given in certain times to
[2:01:40] certain ones who needed to understand.
[2:01:42] Now it wasn't given to us originally. It
[2:01:45] was given to a messenger to a teacher or
[2:01:48] to a prophet.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; But it was given for us that we also
[2:01:53] would profit.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; This time with an F that we would get
[2:01:58] benefit that we would gain.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; And so this is Exusia. But but watch the
[2:02:03] next verse. Acts 18. Look at it with me.
[2:02:07] It says, "But ye shall receive power
[2:02:11] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[2:02:13] you, and you shall be witnesses unto me
[2:02:17] both in JERUSALEM AND IN ALL OF Judea
[2:02:20] and in Samaria and unto
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; the uttermost part
[2:02:27] of the earth."
[2:02:29] Two times Acts 17 power. Acts 18 power.
[2:02:34] You told me that Acts 17 was Exusia.
[2:02:36] What is Acts 18 power? That's the
[2:02:39] dunamis. So, this is one of those
[2:02:42] beautiful places where we can understand
[2:02:45] the two expressions of power. You've got
[2:02:47] to have the ability, the might, the
[2:02:51] strength of the Lord.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; But if you don't have his authority, if
[2:02:55] you're not moving in his authority,
[2:02:58] which is ultimately his government
[2:03:00] established in the kingdom,
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; you will make a big old
[2:03:06] mess.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say, do you want to know? How
[2:03:10] many of you want to know Yiddish? Here's
[2:03:13] a Yiddish word. Bygon.
[2:03:17] You will make a big old bllygon.
[2:03:21] It means a mess,
[2:03:24] a confusing
[2:03:28] mess.
[2:03:31] you will draw attention to yourself
[2:03:35] instead of the one you're representing.
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; It's very important that we know what to
[2:03:44] do.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; We know how to wield to use
[2:03:49] the the power that's been given to us.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; And that we don't use it as a stumbling
[2:03:55] block.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. that we don't do it intentionally
[2:04:00] to become a gazing stock.
[2:04:02] &gt;&gt; If God's called you to be one, he'll
[2:04:04] make you one. But you don't have to see
[2:04:06] just how peculiar, weird, strange, odd.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; You're already peculiar because you
[2:04:14] exclusively belong to him.
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; You don't have to see just how
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; I need some water.
[2:04:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:25] Just a thought of that puts my head in a
[2:04:27] polygon.
[2:04:34] You got a better word? What's the word
[2:04:36] you would use? What would you use for
[2:04:38] just a big one big Oh, I know what they
[2:04:40] say today. Hot mess. I hope that ain't
[2:04:43] ugly. If it is, I didn't know it was
[2:04:49] one big hot mess. It's a polygon.
[2:04:55] Can you give me another one instead of
[2:04:56] just looking at me like I've uh gone off
[2:04:58] on another tangent? What?
[2:05:02] A who? Oh, it's gone squirly. Gone
[2:05:05] squirly. Not a who or what. Sorry. See
[2:05:08] how important it is to hear clearly.
[2:05:11] Gone squirly. Can you imagine?
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; I don't know, brother, but that's just
[2:05:16] gone squirly.
[2:05:19] Is that how you use it? Am I using it
[2:05:20] right? That just looks squirly to me. Is
[2:05:23] that right? Teach me, brother David,
[2:05:25] man.
[2:05:28] That's definitely not Yiddish.
[2:05:31] Give me another one that you would use.
[2:05:36] Oh, come on.
[2:05:38] You all of a sudden you are speechless.
[2:05:41] What would you use? What do you say to
[2:05:42] your family? What do YOU SAY TO YOUR
[2:05:44] children when they've destroyed the
[2:05:46] house? Disaster. You've made a dis.
[2:05:49] That's notmm
[2:05:51] &gt;&gt; a what?
[2:05:53] A kabo.
[2:05:55] Well, listen there. Kabavo. You have
[2:05:58] made a kabo. What's another one? A
[2:06:02] kafalafle.
[2:06:04] Wow.
[2:06:08] Our our our Korean sister, we're we're
[2:06:11] we're teaching her the worst. All these
[2:06:15] expressions,
[2:06:17] they can just mean anything to anybody.
[2:06:20] Kathuffle. What's another good one?
[2:06:24] A who?
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; A tizzy.
[2:06:29] David is in back in the 50s and 60s.
[2:06:35] Oh, tweaking.
[2:06:40] I want my money.
[2:06:42] Didn't somebody promise me money? Didn't
[2:06:45] Didn't once upon a time didn't somebody
[2:06:47] say, "If I would say that in the pull
[2:06:49] pit, they'd give me money." Benjamin,
[2:06:51] weren't you in the room? Somebody
[2:06:53] offered me money. I want it.
[2:06:57] You can buy my lunch. Tweaking.
[2:07:00] Is that like tweeting or it means a
[2:07:04] mess? And you will make one
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; if YOU TRY TO EXERCISE POWER
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; out of your sphere.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. of authority,
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; jurisdiction.
[2:07:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; Do you believe you can follow that? I
[2:07:18] think you can.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; So, so dunamis,
[2:07:22] look at it here. Dunamis is is the word
[2:07:26] 14:11 in Strongs and it means inherent
[2:07:30] power, might, strength, capability,
[2:07:33] power residing in a thing by virtue of
[2:07:37] its nature or which a person or thing
[2:07:40] exerts and puts forth power. Both words
[2:07:44] power, one exusia, one dunamis. Look at
[2:07:47] this with me quickly. John 1:1, I've
[2:07:49] only got two more. John 1:11, I mean,
[2:07:52] excuse me, John 1:11. He came unto his
[2:07:55] own, and his own received him not, but
[2:08:00] as many, next verse. As many
[2:08:03] &gt;&gt; as received him, to them gave he power
[2:08:08] to become
[2:08:10] &gt;&gt; to become
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; to become
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; the sons of God.
[2:08:17] And not just the technon,
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; but the wheels, fully mature,
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; sons, he gave them power to BECOME THE
[2:08:26] SONS OF GOD. Even to them, oh, the
[2:08:30] requirements,
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; come on,
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; are a little less than what you might
[2:08:35] have supposed.
[2:08:37] But as many as received HIM, TO THEM
[2:08:39] GAVE YOU POWER to become the sons of
[2:08:41] God, even to them.
[2:08:48] I believe on his name. Now in in John
[2:08:52] 1:12, what is the power? Is that exusia
[2:08:56] or dunamis?
[2:08:59] How many of you think that might be
[2:09:00] dunamis? Hold up your hand. Several.
[2:09:03] Beautiful. How many of you think that
[2:09:05] might be Exusia authority? Delegated
[2:09:08] authority. So more people have voted for
[2:09:10] Exusia than Dunamis. And you are 100%
[2:09:13] correct.
[2:09:16] The rest of you will need to write 100
[2:09:18] sentences
[2:09:23] or we'll draw a circle on the wall and
[2:09:26] you can put put your nose there for the
[2:09:27] rest of this sermon.
[2:09:29] You got the wrong answer. But remember,
[2:09:31] no answer is a wrong answer
[2:09:33] &gt;&gt; in a forum like this.
[2:09:36] [laughter]
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; It's it's exusia. Yes,
[2:09:44] &gt;&gt; it's exusive. We always preach it. I
[2:09:46] hear I I've done it myself and I've
[2:09:48] heard others PREACH THIS AS THOUGH IT'S
[2:09:50] DUNAMIS. The the the inheritability to
[2:09:53] do something. AS MANY AS RECEIVED HIM,
[2:09:55] TO them gave he the inheritability to
[2:09:58] become the sons of God.
[2:10:01] No, the the the explosive strength to
[2:10:04] become the sons of God. No. THE
[2:10:07] AUTHORITY,
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; THE RIGHT,
[2:10:11] &gt;&gt; THE DELEGATED RIGHT. YES.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; THE JURISDICTION.
[2:10:17] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "AS MANY AS RECEIVED HIM, TO
[2:10:19] THEM GAVE he the legal right."
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:10:25] &gt;&gt; To become the sons of God,
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; AND THEREFORE CAST OUT DEVILS, heal the
[2:10:33] sick,
[2:10:34] &gt;&gt; SPEAK WITH new tongues.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Mark 16.
[2:10:43] One more.
[2:10:45] Revelation 22
[2:10:47] and verse 14. Blessed are they that do
[2:10:52] his commandments,
[2:10:55] that they may have
[2:10:57] right to the tree of life, and may enter
[2:11:01] in,
[2:11:04] not in an illegal way,
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; through the gates
[2:11:09] into the city. Not in a covert way,
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; not as one who sneaks over the wall,
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; but one who goes through the door,
[2:11:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I am the door
[2:11:20] &gt;&gt; of the sheep coat. I am the door of the
[2:11:22] fold. You're going to come here where
[2:11:24] the sheep come. You got to come through
[2:11:26] me.
[2:11:26] &gt;&gt; If you go over the wall, you're a thief.
[2:11:28] You're a hirling. You're a stranger. You
[2:11:31] have no business in the in the flock of
[2:11:33] the Lord." I mean, this is what Jesus
[2:11:34] said. red letter.
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; Blessed are they that do his
[2:11:37] commandments that they might have right
[2:11:39] to the tree of Wait a minute. Wait a
[2:11:41] minute. There's no power here. There's
[2:11:43] no word power here.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; There's no word power here. But there is
[2:11:48] a word here. It's English right
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; and may I that they may have right that
[2:11:57] they may have not not
[2:12:00] inheritability
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; to the tree of life.
[2:12:05] not strength within them
[2:12:08] to the tree of life,
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; but the legal access,
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; the authority to go in
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; and to partake.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; And this is You think this will preach
[2:12:21] all day? It I I I won't. I won't. But
[2:12:23] yes, it would preach all day long
[2:12:25] because THIS IS THE LAST bit of the
[2:12:29] Bible. And it ties in, doesn't it, with
[2:12:32] the first bit? Yeah.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; All the way back to Genesis
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; in the fall, there were placed at the ga
[2:12:39] at the going in of the garden uh a
[2:12:43] flaming sword
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; in in the hand of cherubim
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; who turned in every direction
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; north, south, east, and west.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; And they were guarding what?
[2:13:00] the way
[2:13:03] to the tree of life.
[2:13:06] Did you know that if this was New
[2:13:08] Testament Greek,
[2:13:12] the way
[2:13:13] would be the right?
[2:13:16] That's what it would be. It would be
[2:13:18] Exusia. It could be.
[2:13:21] It's not written in the New Testament,
[2:13:23] but if it were, it could easily be
[2:13:25] Exusia. It could be this angel placed
[2:13:30] here with a flaming sword to guard not
[2:13:33] the tree to guard access to the tree.
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; Let me see who's getting it.
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; I'm not. When I say that, I don't want
[2:13:45] you to think I think I'm so smart I got
[2:13:47] it before you. That's not it. I'm just I
[2:13:50] just want it to drop.
[2:13:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I just won't know if it's dropped
[2:13:53] for anybody yet
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; to guard the way, the right, the access,
[2:13:58] the authority to the tree of life.
[2:14:01] &gt;&gt; Because if you have a right to the tree,
[2:14:06] &gt;&gt; if you have authority, access to the
[2:14:08] tree,
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; nothing,
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; no one,
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; not even an angel.
[2:14:18] You you wouldn't even have to pause at
[2:14:20] the cherry beam
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; because the flaming sword that was once
[2:14:27] positioned to keep you from gaining
[2:14:30] illegal access
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; is now pointing remember it it it moves
[2:14:34] directions.
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:14:37] &gt;&gt; And if it moves 360 degrees, what will
[2:14:40] happen? I know what I said. Yes, sir.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; What will happen?
[2:14:46] It'll be right back where it started.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; But if it moves 180 degrees,
[2:14:53] it'll be facing the other direction.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; The Bible said that that cherubim and
[2:14:58] the flaming sword, they're just moving
[2:14:59] around.
[2:15:02] Somebody said, "What is the concept?"
[2:15:04] Well, it's repeated in the book of
[2:15:06] Ezekiel.
[2:15:08] When Ezekiel saw the Lord,
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; come on.
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; And how did he see him? wheels.
[2:15:17] The wheels within the wheel.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; Wheel within the wheel.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WAS HAPPENING. A
[2:15:27] FLAMING sword guarding the way, guarding
[2:15:30] legal access, guarding authority to have
[2:15:33] eternal life to live forever. I heard
[2:15:36] brother Greley, I believe it was, say in
[2:15:38] one of the services
[2:15:41] that if Adam and Eve would have slipped
[2:15:44] past, I'm paraphrasing, if they would
[2:15:46] have slipped past that guardian,
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; and gained access to the tree of life,
[2:15:53] they would have lived forever.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; In a fallen condition,
[2:16:00] &gt;&gt; a fallen state.
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; Their body has died.
[2:16:06] meaning that the process of death had
[2:16:09] already began in their body from the
[2:16:12] time of the fall.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; They were eternal as they were until the
[2:16:18] fall.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; They would have existed forever in the
[2:16:22] condition that they were in from the
[2:16:25] beginning.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:16:27] &gt;&gt; Except for the fall.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Right. That's right.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; No need. This is some people will I I
[2:16:35] think I'll just do it to see
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; to see if you'll turn up your nose.
[2:16:41] No need for clothes.
[2:16:47] They They didn't need clothes.
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; They were covered
[2:16:57] by glory. Amen.
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; And no one had ever thought of anybody
[2:17:03] else in any other way than a holy way.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; And it would have been that way for
[2:17:09] their offspring.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; For the offspring of Adam and Eve, it
[2:17:16] would have been the same way. They would
[2:17:18] have been given a similar body.
[2:17:21] It would have lived forever.
[2:17:24] As it was created, would it have aged?
[2:17:27] That's a good question. I think perhaps
[2:17:29] there would have been changes because it
[2:17:31] was in the realm of time and not in the
[2:17:33] realm of eternity. Although eternity was
[2:17:35] in their hearts, but it would not have
[2:17:38] ended in corruption. It would not have
[2:17:39] ended in in in in uh you know cancer. It
[2:17:43] would not have ended this way.
[2:17:46] &gt;&gt; But would there have been changes? I
[2:17:48] think perhaps even in the opice of time
[2:17:50] maybe some changes. But can you imagine
[2:17:54] having to live forever in a in a fallen
[2:17:57] condition, darkened, your spirit man
[2:18:01] bowed, broken,
[2:18:04] but you have eternal life,
[2:18:07] meaning you live forever.
[2:18:10] And so a guardian was placed
[2:18:13] &gt;&gt; turning in every direction, guarding the
[2:18:15] way to the tree of life. And then we
[2:18:17] hear
[2:18:19] in Revelation the last the last chapter
[2:18:21] the the end of the end here we hear
[2:18:25] blessed are they
[2:18:27] that do his commandments that they may
[2:18:30] have right that they may have exusia
[2:18:34] that they may have access
[2:18:36] legal authority to the tree of life.
[2:18:40] Brother, if you should have legal access
[2:18:44] to the tree of life, which is a
[2:18:46] representation of the of the reality of
[2:18:49] the Lord Jesus Christ and all that he
[2:18:52] is.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; FULL FULL DISCLOSURE OF JESUS.
[2:18:58] FULL REVELATION OF JESUS. As we say
[2:19:02] sometime, no more through the lattice,
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; but revealed openly, fully, completely,
[2:19:10] totally in maturity. WE NOW HAVE THE
[2:19:12] STATURE OF THE PERFECT MAN.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Before our eyes, it's powerful.
[2:19:20] And when we take, I'm telling you, this
[2:19:22] happens. I I heard uh
[2:19:27] brother Daniel praying and he said as we
[2:19:31] sit under the hearing
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; of the word
[2:19:37] we use the word hearing and listening
[2:19:43] reversed
[2:19:45] biblically to listen means
[2:19:49] it's registering in your ear
[2:19:52] to Hear biblically means it's
[2:19:54] registering in your spirit.
[2:19:59] &gt;&gt; How can they believe if they don't hear?
[2:20:01] How can they hear except there be a
[2:20:03] preacher? How can he preach except he be
[2:20:06] sent? And that's why we have to have an
[2:20:08] absolute.
[2:20:10] &gt;&gt; And we have it in the Holy Bible.
[2:20:13] &gt;&gt; That is our absolute.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; That was brother Brandham's absolute.
[2:20:16] And that better be your absolute.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; We had to have that. Now did we did that
[2:20:23] absolute give us all the understanding?
[2:20:25] No. That required a restoration wordise.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; We couldn't we couldn't follow it all
[2:20:31] but we had it as a guide
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; as a foundation
[2:20:35] as an anchor. Praise the Lord.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, so this is the the full
[2:20:41] disclosure, the full uh I I I'm I'm
[2:20:45] hearing Sister Alfreda in my mind.
[2:20:51] And I use a word on rare occasion, but
[2:20:54] when she was writing,
[2:20:56] she used it all the time. It must have
[2:20:59] been her favorite word. And sometimes I
[2:21:02] would say, we we're probably going to
[2:21:03] need
[2:21:05] we've used that word a lot. We probably
[2:21:07] should maybe find another word to place
[2:21:09] there because we've already said this
[2:21:12] word multiple times. Could anybody guess
[2:21:14] what it was who who read her writings?
[2:21:16] The thing she would put together through
[2:21:18] the years. Nope.
[2:21:21] The word consummation.
[2:21:24] And she grabbed that word and used that
[2:21:28] word and applied that word. The
[2:21:31] consummation of the ages.
[2:21:34] It could also be culmination.
[2:21:38] It could also be
[2:21:41] the crescendo,
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; The loudest shout.
[2:21:47] When the loudest shout comes,
[2:21:50] &gt;&gt; that's the one. Behold, the bridegroom
[2:21:52] cometh.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; It's the midnight cry. When the loudest
[2:21:57] shout comes forth, everything in heaven
[2:21:59] and earth
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; come into a consummation,
[2:22:03] &gt;&gt; a culmination OF THE AGES, THE FULLNESS,
[2:22:06] THE APOSTLE CALLED IT THE FULLNESS OF
[2:22:09] TIMES.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; And in that moment, an end time
[2:22:14] anointing
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; THAT HAS BEEN TYPED and shadowed all
[2:22:19] through the scripture
[2:22:21] is now made available in fullness.
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that the believer can do more
[2:22:28] than believe.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; He can act on what he believes.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; HE CAN PUT IN ACTION WHAT he believes.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; HE CAN SEE RESULTS FOR WHAT he believes.
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; Come on. Because he's willing to take
[2:22:40] God at his word.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; Because he's not just listening under
[2:22:44] the the listening. HE'S UNDER THE
[2:22:46] HEARING.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; HE'S UNDER the sound of the word.
[2:22:50] &gt;&gt; And under the sound of that word.
[2:22:58] things respond.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; All living things
[2:23:04] respond
[2:23:06] in the message kinsman redeemer will be
[2:23:10] done uh shortly.
[2:23:13] It's a relative word.
[2:23:16] Paragraph 168. Now sons and daughters,
[2:23:19] who has the most power before God?
[2:23:23] What is an angel?
[2:23:26] We were just talking about cherubim,
[2:23:28] [clears throat] but there are also
[2:23:29] saraphim
[2:23:31] and other
[2:23:33] hosts. We were singing this morning.
[2:23:35] Benjamin was leading us in a song that's
[2:23:38] called the god of angel armies. Right.
[2:23:42] &gt;&gt; That is a translation
[2:23:45] of zavut in Hebrew which is adonite zut
[2:23:50] which is the lord of hosts.
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:53] &gt;&gt; And we translate it in English the god
[2:23:55] of angel armies.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; He's the one who commands. That's the
[2:24:00] god that's walking with you.
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; That's the god who's talking with you.
[2:24:03] That's the god who's moving
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; working with you
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; TO CONFIRM HIS WORD. AMEN.
[2:24:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; I'm about to get a little happier here.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; It ought to make somebody believe.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; It It ought to change the way you pray.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, if it be possible, if it's your
[2:24:26] will,
[2:24:27] if you get around to it, I don't mean to
[2:24:31] bother you. I don't want to trouble you,
[2:24:34] Lord. I know you're busy hanging worlds
[2:24:38] and shining moons.
[2:24:43] But if it could be possible that I could
[2:24:46] find favor in your sight,
[2:24:51] I would like for you to move, but only
[2:24:54] according to your plan.
[2:24:56] If you've got a better idea, I'm open to
[2:24:59] that.
[2:25:02] Should I go on? I dare say you've prayed
[2:25:05] that kind of a prayer. not that
[2:25:07] creative,
[2:25:09] but you've prayed that kind of a prayer
[2:25:11] this week
[2:25:15] and you could have shortened the whole
[2:25:16] thing and God would have had the same
[2:25:19] response.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:25:22] &gt;&gt; You wouldn't have felt as good because
[2:25:25] we pray sometime for our own feeling
[2:25:29] &gt;&gt; because we're just not sure he gets it
[2:25:30] all.
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; So, we're telling him every minute
[2:25:34] detail.
[2:25:36] Oh, he's an all- knowing God.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; Did you know if I would have prayed a
[2:25:41] big problem and I have just prayed,
[2:25:43] Lord, help.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; I need your help.
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; YOU PROMISED me
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; that ALL I HAD TO DO WAS CALL ON your
[2:25:54] name
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; and understanding would begin to come.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; Faith to believe would begin to come.
[2:26:01] Come on.
[2:26:03] I want us to understand because I still
[2:26:07] feel that sometimes even we here can
[2:26:10] give this impression that if you hold
[2:26:13] your mouth right
[2:26:15] &gt;&gt; the fish will bite better.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; This wives tale, you've heard that,
[2:26:23] haven't you, Jacob? You hold your mouth.
[2:26:24] I must not be holding my mouth just
[2:26:26] right because the fish just won't get on
[2:26:27] my hook.
[2:26:29] And sometimes we make prayer
[2:26:32] like the good luck charm of holding your
[2:26:34] mouth right while you're fishing
[2:26:37] to see if you can get. THAT'S NOT WHAT
[2:26:39] PRAYER IS supposed to be about. If I
[2:26:41] hold my mouth right, he'll hear me.
[2:26:43] He'll answer my prayer. That makes you a
[2:26:45] beggar,
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; not a son.
[2:26:49] &gt;&gt; That makes you a dependent,
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; right?
[2:26:52] &gt;&gt; And not a coair.
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; Listen,
[2:26:55] &gt;&gt; how many co-airs are here? How many of
[2:26:58] you are co-airs?
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "Wait a minute. I DON'T
[2:27:00] KNOW IF THAT'S RIGHT OR NOT." WELL, the
[2:27:01] scripture said so.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; We are joint hes.
[2:27:08] &gt;&gt; We are hes of the father
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; and joint hes coairs. Joint hes with
[2:27:15] Jesus Christ.
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; Does that sound good to anybody?
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; Sounds good to me. Amen.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; And so it's not about holding your mouth
[2:27:22] just right and and praying right, you
[2:27:26] know, just right, doing it right. Three
[2:27:27] steps to breakthrough prayer.
[2:27:32] And and here's here's the first step.
[2:27:34] I'm going to give you the first step to
[2:27:36] breakthrough prayer. Put the book down.
[2:27:41] Delete the the real.
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; And and pray and just pray. Amen.
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; You're spending more time time trying to
[2:27:49] learn how to pray a breakthrough prayer
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; instead of praying.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; You pray enough, you're bound to get it
[2:27:57] right.
[2:27:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; PRAYER CHANGES THINGS.
[2:28:01] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE PRAYER IS NOT TO CHANGE GOD.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Come on.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT TO GET GOD in line.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; Prayer is to help you and I get in line
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; with what what what his will with what
[2:28:13] his will.
[2:28:15] with what his will
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; come on
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; already says.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; You see, I can only bind in earth
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; what has already been bound
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; in heaven.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; And I can only loose on earth what has
[2:28:29] already been loosed in heaven
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; according to the mind of God.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, you'll make a bollygon
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; because you'll be operating explosive
[2:28:38] dunamis without the understanding and
[2:28:40] demonstration of exu of of exusia. Boy,
[2:28:43] that's a lot of words.
[2:28:46] &gt;&gt; Okay. An angel is a servant. That right?
[2:28:48] They're his servants. They're not yours.
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; They're not your genies in a bottle.
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; That's right. They're his servants. WHAT
[2:28:57] ARE YOU? WHAT ARE you
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; sons and daughters?
[2:29:00] &gt;&gt; His sons and daughters. He said, "Who
[2:29:03] has the most power in heaven?" And he's
[2:29:06] not talking about dunamis. I assure you
[2:29:08] of that here. than a sinner that's been
[2:29:10] saved by grace or an archangel
[2:29:15] Gabriel Michael that's standing by his
[2:29:20] right side who has the most exusia the
[2:29:24] most authority power in heaven
[2:29:28] a sinner that's been saved by grace
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; or one who has only been created as a
[2:29:34] servant
[2:29:40] HE SAID THAT SINNER,
[2:29:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN,
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; THAT'S BEEN SAVED by grace
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; has more authority in heaven, brother.
[2:29:46] That's the book.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Because everything an angel does as a
[2:29:54] created servant.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; It has to come by direct command.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; There is no leeway to move through life
[2:30:02] led by the spirit. That angel is a
[2:30:05] created servant. if if he he can't move
[2:30:09] unless he's dispatched or commissioned
[2:30:11] to move.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; There's great examples of that in the
[2:30:14] Bible. One is Jacob Yakov is wrestling
[2:30:17] all night
[2:30:20] with an angel
[2:30:22] and in that wrestling match all of a
[2:30:25] sudden it has come to a halting stop and
[2:30:30] and and this messenger says what? I've
[2:30:33] got to go. The dawn is
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; it's a new the new day is dawning here.
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; I got to get out of here.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; This is not you know the thought of like
[2:30:46] a vampire who can't stand the power of
[2:30:48] the sunlight.
[2:30:50] This was a messenger servant of the Lord
[2:30:53] who receives his commission and dispatch
[2:30:56] before the throne of God.
[2:31:01] And when one one commission's in it, he
[2:31:03] knows exactly when he's supposed to be
[2:31:06] receiving another messenger commission
[2:31:08] and they can't move beyond. Even Jesus
[2:31:11] operated in that manner when he said, "I
[2:31:13] can do nothing except to be shown me of
[2:31:14] my father."
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; But a son who has been fully adopted,
[2:31:22] he is allowed according to the scripture
[2:31:25] to make decision at times.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; That's good. Amen.
[2:31:29] &gt;&gt; Based on his knowledge,
[2:31:31] &gt;&gt; and his understanding
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; of the father's will.
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; And the more of the word that's in you,
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; the more of his will you'll discern
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; because you'll know him better. Amen.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; Now, if that if that uh you know
[2:31:46] stumbled you,
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; don't let it
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham in describing
[2:31:52] the end time army, the sons of God, uh
[2:31:55] uh fully adopted and commissioned sons
[2:31:58] of God, he said they will have
[2:32:02] thus sayaeth the Lord
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; or keep still.
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; There's an inner there's an inner
[2:32:11] leading. You're you're not going before
[2:32:13] the throne at at 6:00 a.m. to get your
[2:32:15] commission like an angel might.
[2:32:18] You're operating in the leadership of
[2:32:22] what has taken not just not just
[2:32:25] visitation.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; But what has taken of habitation,
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; I'm not done, but nearly.
[2:32:33] The sinner that's been saved by grace
[2:32:35] has more authority in heaven than the
[2:32:36] archangel that stood by his side without
[2:32:38] sin because he's a son.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:41] Son has more authority than a servant.
[2:32:43] Of course. OH, WE FORGET WHAT WE ARE.
[2:32:45] LISTEN, THIS IS GOOD. OH, WE FORGET WHAT
[2:32:48] WE ARE AFTER WE BECOME WHAT we are.
[2:32:56] It is right.
[2:32:59] Then we forget how
[2:33:02] we got here.
[2:33:06] If that little bride, if she could just
[2:33:07] know what she is, who she is,
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; do you know why? Why she hasn't fully
[2:33:18] been able
[2:33:20] to grab it, to grasp it, to discern it?
[2:33:26] It's because she's putting it in the
[2:33:27] wrong order.
[2:33:29] Oh, just wait a minute. She's putting it
[2:33:31] in in the in the wrong order. You don't
[2:33:34] put the cart first and the horse behind.
[2:33:39] You put the horse first and the cart
[2:33:42] follows.
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say you've been to church
[2:33:46] because you know now which comes first?
[2:33:49] The horse and then the cart follows. How
[2:33:51] many of you know you've been to church
[2:33:52] because you've heard that? Good. Glad.
[2:33:54] Praise the Lord. There's an order.
[2:33:58] You heard brother Joe say one thing that
[2:34:00] has stood with lots of people. Position
[2:34:04] is key.
[2:34:05] Position matters.
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; We've been emphasizing these things for
[2:34:09] a long long long long time.
[2:34:13] The little little uh fallen captive
[2:34:17] daughter of Zion we were preaching about
[2:34:18] in Cookamo.
[2:34:20] The word of the Lord to her in Isaiah is
[2:34:23] get up, rise up [screaming]
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; and sit down.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; He says rise up and sit down.
[2:34:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; What in the WORLD IS THIS? GET OUT OF
[2:34:36] THE PLACE WHERE you are
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; and come up.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:40] &gt;&gt; Into a place of position in Christ.
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; You're nothing. I'm nothing. He that is
[2:34:46] within us.
[2:34:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; Is everything. Amen.
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; So, it's the position that we've got to
[2:34:52] get a hold of.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; And here here is why we've got the cart
[2:34:57] leading the horse.
[2:34:59] You cannot know what you are as a son of
[2:35:03] God, who you are as a bride of Christ.
[2:35:07] You cannot know that
[2:35:10] until you have fully known him.
[2:35:16] And when the emphasis becomes more
[2:35:21] about the cart
[2:35:24] than the horse,
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; let's say when the emphasis becomes more
[2:35:29] in in in the gospel preaching, in the
[2:35:32] teaching, in the application, when it
[2:35:34] becomes more about the bride
[2:35:37] than the bridegroom,
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; we got to have both. We got to
[2:35:43] understand both. Correct? Amen.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; But [clears throat] you won't know how
[2:35:46] to be his helpmate.
[2:35:48] &gt;&gt; You and I will not know what to do to
[2:35:52] become the fullness of his helpmate if
[2:35:55] we don't know what he likes,
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; what he loves, what he desires, what he
[2:36:00] requires. Come on.
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; I'll I'll say this to stir the critics.
[2:36:06] Uh I'll quote a woman. Ruth Heftlin used
[2:36:09] to say
[2:36:11] when you uh
[2:36:14] she was only she said only in love one
[2:36:16] time
[2:36:17] it didn't become what she would hope
[2:36:21] that it would become because she had a
[2:36:23] call
[2:36:25] to Hong Kong and later to China
[2:36:29] and he was not ready
[2:36:32] for the mission.
[2:36:34] So it never became what she wanted it to
[2:36:36] become. But she said, "So you wonder how
[2:36:38] I can speak about these things." And I
[2:36:41] only experienced it once, but she said,
[2:36:43] "It's not really that complicated."
[2:36:46] She said, "When you love someone,
[2:36:49] you want to discover
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; everything there is about that person
[2:36:55] that you love." And you don't have to
[2:36:58] wait till you're married to begin that
[2:37:00] process.
[2:37:02] You see, if their favorite pie is
[2:37:04] cherry, I'm telling you, I can't imagine
[2:37:07] that. I like cherry pie, but I can't
[2:37:10] imagine that. But if that's your
[2:37:11] favorite,
[2:37:14] you're entitled to that. As long as it
[2:37:17] doesn't come out of the can with that
[2:37:20] thick red goo.
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; Because that is not cherry pie.
[2:37:25] That's cheater pie.
[2:37:28] Amen. Glad we got that under control.
[2:37:33] If that person that you love and care
[2:37:36] about, you see your bridegroom to be
[2:37:40] loves cherry pie and you didn't take
[2:37:43] time to discover that cherry was his
[2:37:45] favorite pie. Uh, is Ezekiel awake? Is
[2:37:49] Isaiah awake? Where are they?
[2:37:52] Are they asleep in the nursery? Go get
[2:37:55] them. Oh, they're right there. So, we
[2:37:57] don't know where they are. You can never
[2:37:59] tell about those kids. Are they asleep?
[2:38:01] Don't wake them up. Ezekiel, step out in
[2:38:03] the aisle there just a minute. Step out
[2:38:04] in the aisle. Everybody turn around and
[2:38:06] look at Ezekiel. No. No.
[2:38:12] Oh, that is sweetness
[2:38:15] mixed with
[2:38:17] Ezekiel, I want you to tell these people
[2:38:20] what Pap's favorite color is.
[2:38:25] Say it loud.
[2:38:27] Blue.
[2:38:33] Now, it wouldn't do any good
[2:38:36] for him to say, "Uh, pap, I bought you a
[2:38:41] tie
[2:38:42] for pap day and your favorite color."
[2:38:47] And me open it up and it'd be green.
[2:38:51] I'd say, "Ezekiel, thank you for the
[2:38:52] tie. I'll find a place to wear the green
[2:38:55] tie. But I need you to know it's not my
[2:38:57] favorite color. Blue is my favorite
[2:38:59] color.
[2:39:01] Do you understand?
[2:39:03] &gt;&gt; But I appreciate the tie. But he knows
[2:39:06] my favorite color is blue because I've
[2:39:08] recently told him it's my he and Isaiah
[2:39:11] that my favorite color was blue. And
[2:39:13] they went home and told their parents.
[2:39:16] He discovered something about pap that
[2:39:18] day that he didn't know before.
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; And if he's smart, he can kind of use
[2:39:23] that to his advantage.
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[2:39:27] Come on.
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; If you're IF THIS PERSON YOU'RE
[2:39:30] INTERESTED IN, THEY LIKE cherry pie and
[2:39:32] and you're bringing them a peanut butter
[2:39:34] pie every week.
[2:39:37] &gt;&gt; They can hardly stand it. They're
[2:39:40] feeding the birds with it.
[2:39:43] You're not winning heart. You're not
[2:39:45] making any progress to know that person.
[2:39:48] Wouldn't you rather not waste the money
[2:39:51] on on bringing them a peanut butter pie
[2:39:53] if they don't eat peanut butter? Now, by
[2:39:54] the way, I'll eat both.
[2:39:58] And sister Ruth would say things like
[2:40:00] that when she was talk. She'd say
[2:40:03] when you care about someone, she said,
[2:40:05] "You don't just love uh who they you you
[2:40:09] watch the way they stand. You you you
[2:40:11] watch the way they they put their
[2:40:12] clothes together. You watch the way they
[2:40:15] they match things. You you you you find
[2:40:17] out their hobbies, the things that they
[2:40:20] that they like. and and and you try your
[2:40:23] best to to do something for them based
[2:40:26] on what you've learned about them.
[2:40:28] Folks, that is so simple, but it's why
[2:40:31] we keep putting the cart before the
[2:40:33] horse.
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; Because we think we know what God is
[2:40:37] looking for in this hour because we read
[2:40:39] some words on paper or we hear some ser.
[2:40:42] But I'm telling you what,
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; we sometimes forget that that the main
[2:40:46] thing has got to always be the main
[2:40:48] thing. Amen. Amen.
[2:40:50] &gt;&gt; And I do believe that the emphasis of
[2:40:52] heaven is on the bride.
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; But I believe that the that the emphasis
[2:40:56] of the bride,
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; must never be on the bride.
[2:40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:01] &gt;&gt; That produces bride pride,
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; not exusia.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; Our emphasis as bride needs to be on the
[2:41:08] bridegroom.
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; Oh my Lord, YOU'RE OH JESUS, YOU'RE
[2:41:12] BEAUTIFUL. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL TO ME.
[2:41:16] I love you in the morning when I first
[2:41:18] wake up and I love you at the noon hour
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; and I love you in the late afternoon and
[2:41:22] I love you in the evening. Oh Jesus,
[2:41:25] you're faithful in all of your ways.
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; My worship is not going to be BASED ON
[2:41:34] MY REACTION
[2:41:36] &gt;&gt; to who he is.
[2:41:38] &gt;&gt; My my my worship is going to be based on
[2:41:40] who he is.
[2:41:42] Oh, TO LOOK UPON HIM, HE'S ALLTOGETHER
[2:41:45] LOVELY. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS ALLTOGETHER
[2:41:48] LOVELY. SOMEBODY SAID, "As a man, I just
[2:41:50] can't call another man beautiful."
[2:41:54] You've never seen him.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; He's so beautiful.
[2:42:01] &gt;&gt; That handsome would never work.
[2:42:04] &gt;&gt; Somebody say, "You've seen him." Every
[2:42:06] time I open the book,
[2:42:08] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:42:09] &gt;&gt; I'm closing. Musicians are coming every
[2:42:11] time I open the book.
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; And he's more beautiful today than he
[2:42:15] ever was to me.
[2:42:20] Altogether lovely.
[2:42:25] We're not just looking for his
[2:42:30] outward feature.
[2:42:33] We're looking for the beauty of his
[2:42:35] heart. Yes.
[2:42:37] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe he has a heart
[2:42:39] for you?
[2:42:42] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe Jesus has a
[2:42:44] heart for you?
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; He said, "I I I have plans for you." The
[2:42:49] Old Testament prophet, "I I have plans
[2:42:51] for you."
[2:42:51] &gt;&gt; Right?
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; I I I I've got some I've got some things
[2:42:54] I want to accomplish for you
[2:42:59] and then in you.
[2:43:02] And then third phase, third anointing,
[2:43:07] third day through you.
[2:43:11] I want to do something for you. I want
[2:43:12] to do something in you. And then I want
[2:43:14] to do something through you. Let's say
[2:43:17] it again. I want to do something for
[2:43:20] you.
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; And then I I want to do something in
[2:43:22] you.
[2:43:23] &gt;&gt; And then I want to do something through
[2:43:25] you.
[2:43:26] &gt;&gt; If you can't see that in the book, look
[2:43:28] again.
[2:43:30] It's the uh the mystery of God revealed.
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:35] &gt;&gt; Just paraphrased version
[2:43:38] and it's beautiful.
[2:43:44] Nothing, no one, no circumstance can dig
[2:43:47] you out of his hand. Praise God.
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; And he didn't just do that to set you on
[2:43:56] the shelf
[2:43:58] &gt;&gt; and look at you like a trophy.
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; He said, "I want to find the people."
[2:44:05] Now, I'm going to say this carefully. I
[2:44:07] hope you follow me. In the beginning,
[2:44:10] it could be
[2:44:15] interpreted.
[2:44:16] I think it would be false. But I think
[2:44:18] that that many times the church has done
[2:44:20] this
[2:44:22] as though he thought that he could
[2:44:24] accomplish everything that he desired to
[2:44:27] accomplish through one nation of people,
[2:44:30] the the Hebrews, the Jews. The Bible is
[2:44:33] clear. God's chosen people. Like it or
[2:44:36] lump it,
[2:44:37] &gt;&gt; it's clear.
[2:44:40] And there are many people who believe as
[2:44:42] an afterthought
[2:44:44] he made a plan for the Gentiles. I
[2:44:47] happen to believe that there was ever
[2:44:49] only one plan
[2:44:52] &gt;&gt; and it was a covenant with mankind.
[2:44:56] &gt;&gt; And both Jews would believe
[2:44:59] and there would be a people called out
[2:45:02] from among the nations. He said
[2:45:04] &gt;&gt; for his name sake.
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I don't think that was an
[2:45:10] afterthought.
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[2:45:12] &gt;&gt; I think it was in his mind to be a one
[2:45:16] new man
[2:45:17] &gt;&gt; as the apostle said,
[2:45:19] &gt;&gt; both Jew and Gentile. That doesn't mean
[2:45:22] that he didn't have a particular love
[2:45:24] and fondness for the Jewish people and
[2:45:26] particularly the geography of the land
[2:45:28] of Israel.
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; That's clear.
[2:45:32] There's no other place in the world that
[2:45:33] you can stand at Elon M.
[2:45:37] You can't stand there in Colorado. You
[2:45:40] can't stand there in New Jersey. You
[2:45:42] can't stand there in the in the Rockies,
[2:45:45] not even the Canadian Rockies in B or in
[2:45:48] the beautiful places of this world. In
[2:45:51] the Alps of Switzerland, in the
[2:45:53] Himalayas of India and Nepal,
[2:45:57] there's one place and one place only
[2:45:59] that you can stand. Elon
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; Morray
[2:46:02] &gt;&gt; and look out over the land that Abraham
[2:46:05] looked out over
[2:46:07] &gt;&gt; when God spoke to him and said, "I'm
[2:46:09] going to make of you a people."
[2:46:14] So God not only loved that people, he
[2:46:16] loved the land.
[2:46:18] &gt;&gt; But I happen to believe that as part of
[2:46:20] that covenant, he always intended to
[2:46:23] pull a people among the nations
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; from all the continents of the world.
[2:46:28] Yes, sir.
[2:46:33] And that grace has moved as the sun
[2:46:35] moves.
[2:46:39] Starting in the east,
[2:46:42] moving west,
[2:46:45] circling the globe. That's what he said.
[2:46:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; And coming all the way back to where it
[2:46:51] started,
[2:46:53] &gt;&gt; which is the east again.
[2:46:56] Isn't it amazing that you can go this is
[2:46:58] how God designed the universe. Sorry,
[2:47:04] you go west and end up east. That's what
[2:47:07] he said. Brother Brandham talked about
[2:47:10] the gospel starting in the east, moving
[2:47:12] west from Jerusalem, moving across this
[2:47:16] nation, moving back around through Asia,
[2:47:20] and the final demonstration
[2:47:22] of God's power to the nations
[2:47:25] in Asia
[2:47:27] and then back to Jerusalem.
[2:47:30] I believe it.
[2:47:33] &gt;&gt; I don't think God made a mistake. I
[2:47:35] believe it.
[2:47:37] In fact, we're doing all we know to do
[2:47:39] to help make that a reality.
[2:47:42] &gt;&gt; You can't move God in your timing,
[2:47:45] &gt;&gt; but you can make sure that when it is
[2:47:46] time, things are in place
[2:47:50] &gt;&gt; because he said they gave this message,
[2:47:54] this gospel to the Gentiles,
[2:47:57] and it will be our responsibility to
[2:48:00] return it,
[2:48:02] paraphrase, to the Jews. Amen.
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; This time it's a one new man.
[2:48:08] &gt;&gt; Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Where are we going
[2:48:10] with all this?
[2:48:12] Nowhere but up.
[2:48:14] &gt;&gt; Let's stand.
[2:48:16] You are patient people.
[2:48:19] You're beautiful people. Amazing people.
[2:48:26] And that's because you've got your eyes
[2:48:30] on the one who is.
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:34] The more you look upon him, the more
[2:48:37] like him you become.
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; Isn't that what Paul said?
[2:48:42] &gt;&gt; How many of you want to be changed?
[2:48:45] &gt;&gt; Well, the scripture tells us how we're
[2:48:47] changed. From glory to glory, God,
[2:48:49] &gt;&gt; from strength to strength,
[2:48:50] &gt;&gt; from faith to faith.
[2:48:52] &gt;&gt; Meaning that it is a process. Yes.
[2:48:57] &gt;&gt; I want to say one more thing for anybody
[2:48:59] that's still mentally awake.
[2:49:02] And that is this. This is where we can
[2:49:05] get impatient.
[2:49:06] The the economy of the kingdom is not of
[2:49:10] the earth. And the timeline of the
[2:49:12] kingdom is not of the earth.
[2:49:14] &gt;&gt; It's of another realm, isn't it? The
[2:49:16] scripture tells us that it's up to the
[2:49:18] father. He's the one who holds the
[2:49:20] exusia to know the difference in times
[2:49:22] and seasons. And we're just here waiting
[2:49:24] on command, waiting on instruction,
[2:49:26] right? Waiting on leadership. Does that
[2:49:28] bother you? Does that make you feel out
[2:49:30] of control? It actually makes me feel
[2:49:32] very well to know that my heavenly
[2:49:35] father,
[2:49:37] &gt;&gt; the eternal spirit of God knows exactly.
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; Here's what I want to say to you. One,
[2:49:43] just one more little thing. Here's how
[2:49:46] it goes. Gradually,
[2:49:50] gradually,
[2:49:54] gradually,
[2:49:56] gradually,
[2:49:57] gradually,
[2:49:59] gradually. Okay. Okay. Pep. gradually,
[2:50:04] suddenly.
[2:50:14] I don't know if there was much of an
[2:50:16] amen, but I wasn't after it.
[2:50:20] That's it.
[2:50:22] If you are a person who can only discern
[2:50:25] in suddenly,
[2:50:29] you you're going to fall off.
[2:50:31] Yeah,
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; we better tie a rope around you because
[2:50:34] when this thing starts speeding up, you
[2:50:36] will fall right off the back of the
[2:50:37] boat.
[2:50:40] &gt;&gt; We have to understand in the fullness of
[2:50:43] scripture that God is always in process.
[2:50:49] &gt;&gt; Even his coming
[2:50:51] &gt;&gt; was a process. That's right.
[2:50:57] &gt;&gt; The dead in Christ shall rise first, and
[2:51:00] then we which
[2:51:02] the Lord himself shall descend from
[2:51:04] heaven with a shout, with the voice of
[2:51:08] the archangel, with the last trump, with
[2:51:11] a
[2:51:13] last voice process.
[2:51:18] That's why some people could say we're
[2:51:19] in the process of his coming now. We
[2:51:21] are. We are always have been.
[2:51:25] &gt;&gt; It's another fullness of times moment.
[2:51:27] He came manifested in the flesh in the
[2:51:30] fullness of times moment
[2:51:32] when the when the earth was absolutely
[2:51:35] ripe and pregnant
[2:51:39] with with hope and potential
[2:51:41] of what was to come.
[2:51:45] Roads were being built like never
[2:51:47] before. Ships were being built like
[2:51:50] never before. Technology was advancing
[2:51:54] like never before on a broad scale. Why?
[2:51:57] Because God was getting things ready.
[2:51:59] Things were accelerating in the earth to
[2:52:02] receive the king
[2:52:03] &gt;&gt; the first time.
[2:52:04] &gt;&gt; Because when the gospel came, somebody
[2:52:06] was going to use those roads
[2:52:08] &gt;&gt; and somebody was going to they weren't
[2:52:10] they weren't built there for commerce
[2:52:11] only. They were built there to get the
[2:52:14] gospel to the far ends of the earth.
[2:52:16] Hello.
[2:52:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And there's never been a
[2:52:19] moment of technology and advancement
[2:52:22] &gt;&gt; as we have today.
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; Both literal and artificial.
[2:52:27] &gt;&gt; This this is an amazing evil, ugly,
[2:52:30] dark. Yes. Is it dark out there?
[2:52:34] Absolutely. Or is there trouble out
[2:52:36] there? Absolutely. Is there violence,
[2:52:38] hatred, and division out there?
[2:52:39] Absolutely. And if we if we keep our
[2:52:42] mind out there and our mouth out there
[2:52:45] and we speak of that and think of that,
[2:52:47] we will be a thermosometer.
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; A thermometer
[2:52:56] &gt;&gt; just reporting the facts.
[2:52:58] &gt;&gt; But if we'll realize that when it's very
[2:53:00] dark out there, it's very bright in here
[2:53:03] in the word, in him, in truth,
[2:53:05] &gt;&gt; then we will no longer just be the the
[2:53:08] thermometer will become a thermostat.
[2:53:10] This was the bride's call
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; to change the atmosphere around her
[2:53:16] &gt;&gt; because we didn't get to the verse, but
[2:53:17] you know it. Jesus said something else
[2:53:19] in red letter
[2:53:22] greater
[2:53:24] works.
[2:53:25] Praise God.
[2:53:28] &gt;&gt; And scholars look at that and they say
[2:53:33] he may not
[2:53:35] particularly be talking about greater in
[2:53:39] the sense
[2:53:42] of
[2:53:44] potency
[2:53:47] because all power is all power. Praise
[2:53:49] God.
[2:53:52] &gt;&gt; But he's definitely speaking of greater
[2:53:56] in the sense of frequency
[2:54:03] &gt;&gt; and reach
[2:54:05] &gt;&gt; greater works.
[2:54:08] Not just
[2:54:10] to the places we can walk.
[2:54:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:14] &gt;&gt; But greater works than this shall you
[2:54:16] do.
[2:54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. because I'm going
[2:54:19] &gt;&gt; and if you'll let me go.
[2:54:22] &gt;&gt; The Bible precedent is this. If you let
[2:54:25] Elijah go,
[2:54:27] &gt;&gt; a double portion
[2:54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54:29] &gt;&gt; and Elisha company
[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; follows.
[2:54:33] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist, if you'll let me go,
[2:54:36] you'll fully embrace the one who has
[2:54:37] come to save.
[2:54:41] &gt;&gt; He must
[2:54:43] He must
[2:54:45] &gt;&gt; increase. I must
[2:54:47] &gt;&gt; decrease.
[2:54:49] &gt;&gt; I said it that way on purpose
[2:54:52] because the only way that we can
[2:54:54] decrease is when we see him
[2:54:56] &gt;&gt; increasing.
[2:54:59] This is how it works.
[2:55:02] Gradually,
[2:55:04] gradually, gradually, gradually,
[2:55:07] gradually,
[2:55:11] gradually.
[2:55:12] It's a process. It's unfolding. It's an
[2:55:14] unveiling. It's a little here. It's
[2:55:16] [snorts] a little there.
[2:55:19] Line upon line, precept upon precept.
[2:55:26] Wheels turning, first guarding the way,
[2:55:31] and then giving us the right
[2:55:34] to the tree of life. Gradually,
[2:55:36] gradually, gradually, gradually,
[2:55:40] gradually, gradually, gradually,
[2:55:45] suddenly,
[2:55:48] &gt;&gt; it's how God has worked from the
[2:55:50] beginning.
[2:55:52] &gt;&gt; It's how he's working now.
[2:55:54] &gt;&gt; If you can't embrace the gradual,
[2:56:01] you'll quit.
[2:56:02] &gt;&gt; Praise God. But I want you to know I'm
[2:56:05] going to have I'm going to walk in the
[2:56:06] suddenly. I'm going to walk in the
[2:56:08] suddenlys of God. The promise said so.
[2:56:11] That's the breakthrough.
[2:56:13] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:56:13] &gt;&gt; that's the pushing through. Now, I've
[2:56:15] been I've been gradually getting you
[2:56:17] ready and you're still not ready.
[2:56:21] Suddenly sing.
[2:56:26] &gt;&gt; He's my son and I can talk to him that
[2:56:29] way if I need to.
[2:56:32] Let's worship.
[2:56:33] &gt;&gt; My [singing] Jesus,
[2:56:36] &gt;&gt; my savior,
[2:56:36] &gt;&gt; my savior.
[2:56:39] Lord, there is [singing] none like you.
[2:56:45] All of my days
[2:56:48] I want to praise
[2:56:52] the wonders [singing] of your mighty
[2:56:58] love.
[2:57:02] My comfort, [singing]
[2:57:05] you're my shelter,
[2:57:08] a tower [singing] of reuge
[2:57:12] and shrink.
[2:57:14] Let [singing] every breath.
[2:57:17] Let all that I am
[2:57:21] never [music] cease to worship
[2:57:26] you.
[2:57:28] Oh,
[2:57:30] shout to [music] the Lord all the earth.
[2:57:34] Let us sing. [singing]
[2:57:38] Power in majesty.
[2:57:41] Praise to the king.
[2:57:45] Mountains [music and singing] bowed down
[2:57:47] in the seas.
[2:57:49] We roll over at the sound
[2:57:54] of your name.
[2:58:00] I sing for joy at the work of your
[2:58:05] hands.
[2:58:07] Forever I love you. Forever
[2:58:12] I stand.
[2:58:15] Nothing compares [music and singing]
[2:58:17] to the promise I have in you.
[2:58:30] and my Jesus
[2:58:34] my savior. [singing and music]
[2:58:37] Lord, there is none like you
[2:58:42] and all of my [music] days.
[2:58:46] Oh, I want to praise
[2:58:49] the wonders of your mighty
[2:58:55] love.
[2:58:59] You're my comfort,
[2:59:04] my shelter,
[2:59:06] a tower [singing] of reuge.
[2:59:11] Lord, let every breath Oh, let all
[2:59:16] [music] that I am. Oh, never cease to
[2:59:21] worship
[2:59:25] you. Oh,
[2:59:28] shout to [music] the Lord. All the
[2:59:31] earth, let us sing. We sing power and
[2:59:37] majesty,
[2:59:38] praise to the king.
[2:59:42] Mountains [music] bow out in the seas
[2:59:47] they roar
[2:59:49] at the sound
[2:59:52] of your name.
[2:59:55] [music]
[2:59:57] I sing for joy at the work of your
[3:00:02] hands.
[3:00:04] Forever I love you. Forever
[3:00:09] I'll stand. Oh, nothing [music] compares
[3:00:12] [singing]
[3:00:13] to the proise I have in you.
[3:00:22] Oh, [music]
[3:00:25] and shout to the Lord. All the earth,
[3:00:30] let us sing. [music]
[3:00:32] We sing power and majesty
[3:00:36] praise to the king.
[3:00:40] Mountains [music]
[3:00:41] bow out and the seas
[3:00:45] will [singing] roar at the sound
[3:00:50] of your name.
[3:00:55] I sing [music] for joy at the work of
[3:00:59] your hands.
[3:01:02] Forever I love you. Forever
[3:01:07] I'll stand.
[3:01:09] Nothing compares to the proise I have.
[3:01:16] Oh, nothing [music and singing] compares
[3:01:19] to the promise I have. You know, a lot
[3:01:23] of times we we just leave it spontaneous
[3:01:28] and who would come and and and not and
[3:01:32] not make it an altar call type
[3:01:36] tradition.
[3:01:37] But I'm a little disappointed this
[3:01:39] morning because I really feel that it
[3:01:42] would be an amazing opportunity for just
[3:01:44] a few minutes. There's no service
[3:01:47] tonight. You don't meet again till
[3:01:49] Tuesday night. I feel like it would be
[3:01:52] extremely beneficial if more of you
[3:01:55] would join us here. If you can't stand
[3:01:58] for long, just come and sit close.
[3:02:01] The front rows are empty. And let's
[3:02:03] worship him with the same song for just
[3:02:06] a moment.
[3:02:08] The focus is not on your need
[3:02:11] &gt;&gt; for just a moment.
[3:02:14] If you came forward to focus on your
[3:02:16] need, that's not this opportunity.
[3:02:20] This opportunity is to come forward and
[3:02:22] focus on the one who meets all all of
[3:02:25] our needs.
[3:02:27] And you know what happens when he
[3:02:29] becomes the focus? Our needs get
[3:02:32] attended to
[3:02:34] &gt;&gt; and get ministered to.
[3:02:36] when it becomes more about us than him.
[3:02:40] Let's sing it again. Thank you. Thank
[3:02:42] every one of you. Thank you. And when
[3:02:44] you're tired, just go sit close. Sing it
[3:02:47] again, son. Let's sing to him.
[3:02:49] &gt;&gt; My Jesus, [singing]
[3:02:52] my
[3:02:55] &gt;&gt; Lord, [music] there is none like you.
[3:03:00] yourself
[3:03:01] &gt;&gt; and all of my [singing] days. [music]
[3:03:04] &gt;&gt; Lord, I want to praise your
[3:03:08] &gt;&gt; the wonders of your [singing] mighty.
[3:03:14] &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter whether [music] it's
[3:03:16] physical or spiritual or emotional.
[3:03:18] &gt;&gt; Oh my comfort.
[3:03:21] &gt;&gt; He's big enough.
[3:03:22] &gt;&gt; You are my strength.
[3:03:24] &gt;&gt; He has enough power. Tower
[3:03:26] [music and singing] operation
[3:03:29] shake.
[3:03:30] Lord, let every breath supply.
[3:03:34] &gt;&gt; Let [music] all that I am. Let it never
[3:03:39] cease to
[3:03:41] [singing and music]
[3:03:47] shout to the Lord. All the earth let us
[3:03:52] sing power. We sing power [music] and
[3:03:56] majesty
[3:03:58] praise to the king.
[3:04:02] Mountains [music and singing] bow out in
[3:04:04] the seas they roar and at my sound
[3:04:11] of [music] your name.
[3:04:16] rising for joy [music]
[3:04:19] at the work of your hands.
[3:04:24] Forever I love you. Forever
[3:04:28] I'll stand.
[3:04:31] Nothing [music] compares to the promise
[3:04:36] I have in you.
[3:04:45] and shout to the Lord [music] all the
[3:04:48] earth.
[3:04:49] &gt;&gt; Let the sound of your voice sing,
[3:04:51] &gt;&gt; be heard.
[3:04:53] Power [music] and majesty
[3:04:56] praise to you, King.
[3:05:00] Mountains [music] bow out.
[3:05:03] Seas will roar inside the [music]
[3:05:08] build of your name.
[3:05:14] your [music] house. I sing for joy and
[3:05:18] the word of God
[3:05:22] &gt;&gt; forever
[3:05:25] [music] forever.
[3:05:27] I'll stand perfect.
[3:05:29] &gt;&gt; Nothing [singing] compares to the
[3:05:33] promise I have.
[3:05:35] &gt;&gt; I want to say nothing compares.
[3:05:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, nothing [music]
[3:05:38] compares [singing]
[3:05:39] to the proise I have.
[3:05:45] There is nothing or no one that compares
[3:05:48] to the promise that we have
[3:05:51] &gt;&gt; in you.
[3:05:54] &gt;&gt; The emphasis is not on the promise. The
[3:05:57] emphasis is on the promise giver.
[3:06:00] &gt;&gt; Because our promisegiver is the
[3:06:02] promiseke keeper.
[3:06:04] The one who has promised, the one who
[3:06:06] has spoken is also the one who has both
[3:06:10] power and authority to bring it to pass.
[3:06:13] &gt;&gt; So right now, Lord, according to your
[3:06:15] riches in glory, we are not here
[3:06:20] for for for some demonstration
[3:06:23] of religion. We are here to put our hand
[3:06:27] on your head.
[3:06:29] &gt;&gt; What a beautiful sacrifice
[3:06:32] you have been.
[3:06:34] What a beautiful offering you have been.
[3:06:38] And without you, separated from you, we
[3:06:41] can never find our way. But if we keep
[3:06:45] holding to your head,
[3:06:49] we know that all life flows from your
[3:06:52] head through the corporate body,
[3:06:56] the corporate Messiah.
[3:06:59] Lord, some are sick in body. You're a
[3:07:02] healer.
[3:07:02] &gt;&gt; [music]
[3:07:03] &gt;&gt; We believe you use doctors. We believe
[3:07:05] medicine helps. But we want to always
[3:07:08] give you the glory.
[3:07:10] &gt;&gt; And we've seen what you can do. There
[3:07:13] are many things we can do to help
[3:07:15] ourselves. But there are times when we
[3:07:17] cannot help ourselves. And you are
[3:07:19] standing ever ready to help us. If you
[3:07:23] need a healing, a help in your body,
[3:07:25] just reach your hand to him. Lord, you
[3:07:27] see every hand and you see the need. You
[3:07:30] see the need. And if someone has their
[3:07:33] hand lifted for someone else, you see
[3:07:36] that and you know that as well. And we
[3:07:39] want to say according to the word, with
[3:07:42] your stripes,
[3:07:45] &gt;&gt; we were healed.
[3:07:47] &gt;&gt; The tense is finished.
[3:07:50] &gt;&gt; We want to see the reality of it break
[3:07:53] forth
[3:07:54] &gt;&gt; in our physical form. You created every
[3:07:57] system of our body and nothing, no one,
[3:08:00] nothing can make it function
[3:08:02] in the same manner and order of the
[3:08:04] creator. So we ask you right now
[3:08:07] according to you, you said right in your
[3:08:09] word, Isaiah prophesied with with his
[3:08:14] stripes.
[3:08:15] &gt;&gt; You were w you were wounded. You were
[3:08:17] bruised for our iniquity and
[3:08:20] transgression. The chastisement, the
[3:08:22] breaking up of our peace was upon you
[3:08:26] &gt;&gt; and with your stripes,
[3:08:27] &gt;&gt; by your stripes.
[3:08:31] &gt;&gt; We're whole.
[3:08:34] &gt;&gt; So, Father, right now, we believe we
[3:08:36] come into agreement in the name of Jesus
[3:08:39] that healing will manifest and be
[3:08:41] demonstrated. [music]
[3:08:43] Several of you sisters lay hands on
[3:08:46] Sister Tiffany. I was standing there
[3:08:48] last Sunday with her and her husband as
[3:08:52] they were sharing
[3:08:54] not not such good news.
[3:08:58] But I know the one who is good news
[3:09:01] &gt;&gt; and I know the one who is able
[3:09:03] &gt;&gt; to show himself strong and mighty in her
[3:09:06] physical need. Father, in the name of
[3:09:09] Jesus, we're not making her the focus.
[3:09:12] We're making the promise giver the
[3:09:14] focus. You're the one and she
[3:09:17] desperately needs you to pass by today
[3:09:21] &gt;&gt; and execute
[3:09:23] &gt;&gt; healing.
[3:09:26] &gt;&gt; May it be actuated. May it come to
[3:09:28] reality in her life for the glory of
[3:09:30] God. May May Lord just move what needs
[3:09:35] to be moved, repair what needs to be
[3:09:38] repaired.
[3:09:39] &gt;&gt; Lead and guide and direct her in every
[3:09:42] decision.
[3:09:44] &gt;&gt; To put this battle behind her.
[3:09:46] &gt;&gt; If surgery is needed and surgery is your
[3:09:48] will, you'll go with her every step of
[3:09:51] the way. You will you will certainly
[3:09:54] guide the hand of the surgeon and
[3:09:55] protect her not only in that process but
[3:09:58] in the process of healing and recovery.
[3:10:01] We don't know exactly the circumstances
[3:10:04] of your plan but we know the outcome.
[3:10:07] &gt;&gt; The outcome is to the glory of God that
[3:10:10] your name would be exalted and
[3:10:12] sanctified and set apart and praised. So
[3:10:17] Lord, we just we get out of your way and
[3:10:19] we ask you to come and touch her now in
[3:10:22] such a way that you would receive the
[3:10:24] highest glory
[3:10:26] &gt;&gt; for what's happening in her body. She's
[3:10:29] got littles to take care of and she
[3:10:32] needs healing. She needs to be able to
[3:10:34] walk without pain and without doing more
[3:10:36] damage.
[3:10:38] You sense your word. Does anybody
[3:10:40] believe? I believe. I believe.
[3:10:42] &gt;&gt; I believe. I really believe.
[3:10:46] Lord, we ask you to go to those who are
[3:10:48] streaming this service right now who
[3:10:51] have needs in their body.
[3:10:53] It's not about being in a physical
[3:10:55] place. It's about touching you in faith.
[3:10:58] Would you reach right down across the
[3:11:00] world? I saw multiple nations
[3:11:02] represented.
[3:11:04] You're the healer. The healer in Alabama
[3:11:06] is the healer in Mosmbique, in
[3:11:11] &gt;&gt; Norway, in wherever. Yes,
[3:11:14] &gt;&gt; you're the same. Your power to heal and
[3:11:17] save and deliver remains the same as
[3:11:19] well.
[3:11:21] &gt;&gt; If you're here and you've been dealing
[3:11:23] with an increase in your perhaps anxiety
[3:11:28] or or emotional unrest, just put up your
[3:11:32] hand. Don't be ashamed.
[3:11:34] That's not who you are. That's what's
[3:11:37] happening.
[3:11:38] There's a solution.
[3:11:40] Father, I didn't even look to see all
[3:11:43] the hands because it's not that I would
[3:11:46] want to think of that again,
[3:11:48] but I know you saw
[3:11:50] &gt;&gt; and maybe the one who just could not
[3:11:52] find the courage,
[3:11:55] but chose privacy.
[3:11:57] That doesn't exclude them.
[3:12:00] You're able to do exceedingly abundantly
[3:12:03] above.
[3:12:04] It is not your will for us to live in
[3:12:07] turmoil
[3:12:08] &gt;&gt; mentally or emotionally.
[3:12:11] &gt;&gt; You said that you would keep us in
[3:12:13] perfect peace if our [music] mind was
[3:12:16] fixed state on you.
[3:12:19] &gt;&gt; So Lord, we fix our mind on you right
[3:12:21] now. And we ask that anxiety would
[3:12:24] decrease
[3:12:26] &gt;&gt; until it is no more.
[3:12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. [music]
[3:12:29] &gt;&gt; In every believer,
[3:12:31] &gt;&gt; especially the crippling kind,
[3:12:34] &gt;&gt; that paralyzes,
[3:12:36] &gt;&gt; yes,
[3:12:38] &gt;&gt; that keeps us from reaching the fullness
[3:12:41] of your destiny plan.
[3:12:43] Those who deal with bless, depression,
[3:12:46] and and other discouragements. Lord,
[3:12:49] you're the glory and the lifter of our
[3:12:52] head. COME AND BE JESUS. COME AND BE
[3:12:55] Jesus
[3:12:57] to each one
[3:12:59] who has that need.
[3:13:06] &gt;&gt; One more little prayer assignment and
[3:13:08] that is this. If you're one of those who
[3:13:11] has bogged down, your faith has bogged
[3:13:14] down in the gradually.
[3:13:18] The Bible says, "Hope deferred maketh
[3:13:20] the heart sick."
[3:13:23] The heart is the seat of the emotions.
[3:13:26] It affects everything in the body. This
[3:13:28] is not the blood pump, but the inside of
[3:13:31] the inside.
[3:13:33] Waiting, waiting, waiting on the
[3:13:34] gradually to become the suddenlys. And
[3:13:36] if you find your faith getting sort of
[3:13:40] stalled in in in those moments, not
[3:13:42] always, but at times in the process,
[3:13:44] would you just put up your hand right
[3:13:46] now? I need something on my faith. I
[3:13:48] need uh the oil on my faith right now.
[3:13:52] Father, I have been right there. I have
[3:13:54] stood right where that individual is
[3:13:56] standing. Maybe not the same
[3:13:58] circumstance, but the same thought and
[3:14:00] feeling. Uh Lord, we're weary of
[3:14:02] waiting. We're tired of waiting. We
[3:14:04] would love to see you do it now. Now,
[3:14:06] now. Lord, I ask right now that for any
[3:14:10] person under the sound of my voice who
[3:14:12] finds their faith level, their their
[3:14:15] faith tank getting low.
[3:14:19] &gt;&gt; I I watch I've watched many times what
[3:14:21] you can do to that one measure of faith
[3:14:23] you gave us.
[3:14:24] &gt;&gt; You pour oil on it. We get in the right
[3:14:27] atmosphere
[3:14:29] &gt;&gt; and the faith that dains and dwindles
[3:14:32] increases and multiplies
[3:14:35] [music]
[3:14:35] &gt;&gt; in in exponential ways. So Lord, right
[3:14:38] now I ask that you would do that for any
[3:14:43] person who's dealing with the with the
[3:14:46] mundane of the process
[3:14:49] &gt;&gt; and the weariness of waiting. You said,
[3:14:52] "They that wait upon the Lord, which is
[3:14:56] to serve, not to do nothing. They that
[3:14:59] wait upon the Lord shall renew their
[3:15:02] strength. They shall mount up with wings
[3:15:04] AS EAGLES. THEY SHALL run
[3:15:08] &gt;&gt; and not be weary. They shall walk and
[3:15:11] not faint." So, I'm asking for that for
[3:15:15] that anointing, for that blessing.
[3:15:18] I I'm going to ask you hold your hand up
[3:15:20] if that was you. Again,
[3:15:26] if you're standing near someone, you
[3:15:28] likely are.
[3:15:29] Agree with them. You don't have to even
[3:15:31] touch them. Just agree with them. Lord,
[3:15:33] I'm not only asking for help for mine.
[3:15:35] I'm asking help for him, for her.
[3:15:40] Put a put a a go. put up
[3:15:45] a new zeal, a new passion to believe you
[3:15:48] for every promise.
[3:15:53] Put a watch over our heart and to stay
[3:15:55] on [music] our lips. And when you find
[3:15:58] us speaking against the breakthroughs
[3:16:01] and the suddenies that are to come,
[3:16:04] would you convict and correct us
[3:16:08] &gt;&gt; and give us an opportunity to say it
[3:16:09] better, to express it better?
[3:16:12] &gt;&gt; We're waiting. We're [music] waiting.
[3:16:14] We're waiting. We're waiting on you.
[3:16:16] Serving you every day, believing that
[3:16:19] not one tiny part of your word, one tiny
[3:16:23] part of your promise will fall to the
[3:16:25] ground.
[3:16:27] without fruition in our lives.
[3:16:31] We're going to sing that little chorus
[3:16:33] now before we go. They that wait upon
[3:16:35] the Lord. It's pretty old,
[3:16:38] but it's mighty good.
[3:16:41] It comes right from the book.
[3:16:44] &gt;&gt; Let's sing it together.
[3:16:47] They that wait
[3:16:50] upon the Lord
[3:16:53] shall renew.
[3:16:59] They shall mount up
[3:17:02] with wings
[3:17:05] as [singing] he goes.
[3:17:09] They
[3:17:11] shall [music] run.
[3:17:15] They go from not hardly walking
[3:17:19] to running.
[3:17:22] Teach me Lord. Again, teach me Lord.
[3:17:25] Teach me Lord.
[3:17:30] Your antenna is toward him. They that
[3:17:33] wait
[3:17:35] upon the Lord
[3:17:38] shall [singing]
[3:17:39] renew. [music]
[3:17:42] encourage.
[3:17:46] Hold on.
[3:17:49] Believe has he gone. [music and singing]
[3:17:53] Oh, they shall run.
[3:17:59] [music]
[3:18:00] They shall fall.
[3:18:04] Teach [music] us Lord. Teach us Lord.
[3:18:09] Teach us Lord.
[3:18:14] One more time. They that wait, they that
[3:18:18] wait, I'm one of those
[3:18:22] serving until [music] the answer.
[3:18:27] They shall mount up
[3:18:30] [music]
[3:18:35] as eagles. [music]
[3:18:38] Never too late. They shall run [music]
[3:18:42] and not be weary.
[3:18:45] They [singing]
[3:18:46] shall walk.
[3:18:50] Teach me Lord.
[3:18:54] Teach me Lord.
[3:18:59] While they [music] play that, would you
[3:19:00] greet one another? God bless you. God
[3:19:04] bless you.
[3:19:06] I'm going to pray for you. Happy to see
[3:19:08] you in the house of God.
[3:19:13] They shout
[3:19:16] with wings
[3:19:19] as he goes.
[3:19:22] [singing]
[3:19:24] They shall run
[3:19:26] and not be weary.
[3:19:29] They shall walk and not faint.
[3:19:50] Sorry. Don't be nervous when I can hear
[3:19:51] you but me.
[3:19:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, of course.
[3:20:03] Yes. This is
[3:20:06] biblical to do such a thing to lay it
[3:20:10] before the Lord.
[3:20:16] Dear Lord.
[3:20:28] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[3:20:34] shall renew
[3:20:37] their strength. They shall man
[3:20:48] they shall [music] run.
[3:20:59] &gt;&gt; Teach me Lord my Bible.
[3:21:02] Teach [music] me, Lord,
[3:21:06] to wait. One more time. Just a minute.
[3:21:08] If you need to go, you can certainly go.
[3:21:11] If you have to slip out
[3:21:14] Tuesday night at 7:00,
[3:21:17] but we've got a little matter we [music]
[3:21:18] want to give to the Lord. Thank you.
[3:21:21] They shall mount up. I'm not going to
[3:21:25] use it except that
[3:21:28] as he goes
[3:21:31] they
[3:21:33] shall run.
[3:21:35] [music]
[3:21:43] &gt;&gt; Teach me Lord. [music] Teach me Lord.
[3:21:52] again. If you need to go, you can.
[3:21:55] There's an enemy out there.
[3:21:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[3:21:58] &gt;&gt; Who has
[3:22:00] uh sent a letter
[3:22:03] to our brother and sister,
[3:22:07] business related,
[3:22:10] but what it really is is an attack.
[3:22:14] &gt;&gt; It is
[3:22:15] &gt;&gt; against their faith.
[3:22:17] And there's only one solution
[3:22:20] and one answer to that and that's the
[3:22:24] authority of the word.
[3:22:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:22:26] &gt;&gt; Now, if we could only tell them that and
[3:22:29] they would just forget it all.
[3:22:31] &gt;&gt; But we don't even have to. It's not
[3:22:33] about convincing the enemy,
[3:22:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[3:22:36] &gt;&gt; It's about making sure you're fully
[3:22:38] convinced
[3:22:39] &gt;&gt; and persuaded. Was it Hezekiah
[3:22:43] who got this threatening letter, mocking
[3:22:46] letter?
[3:22:48] You know, if I were you, I just give up
[3:22:50] now. You certainly don't have the p the
[3:22:54] power, the the ability, the strength to
[3:22:56] stand against the army that we have
[3:22:58] amassed.
[3:23:00] &gt;&gt; And what did he do?
[3:23:03] &gt;&gt; He just spread it out
[3:23:06] &gt;&gt; before the Lord.
[3:23:08] &gt;&gt; You know, this is good.
[3:23:10] And and basically he said, "Now God, you
[3:23:12] read it
[3:23:15] &gt;&gt; because what has been written as a
[3:23:18] threat against me and my spiritual
[3:23:20] jurisdiction is really it's really a
[3:23:23] threat against you." That's
[3:23:25] &gt;&gt; right.
[3:23:26] &gt;&gt; You see how faith can work?
[3:23:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:23:29] &gt;&gt; And if you choose to ignore it, you're
[3:23:32] going to have to help me through every
[3:23:33] step.
[3:23:35] But I just have this feeling that if I
[3:23:38] give it to you.
[3:23:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:23:41] &gt;&gt; And you know what? God knows how.
[3:23:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:23:43] &gt;&gt; And he did.
[3:23:46] &gt;&gt; He could have had a nervous breakdown.
[3:23:49] He could have, you know,
[3:23:52] uh he could have felt like he was in a
[3:23:55] bagon
[3:23:57] and a hopeless situation, but he he just
[3:24:00] laid it before the Lord.
[3:24:02] I was looking this morning to to the
[3:24:05] last Sunday I was here preaching to see
[3:24:07] where I stopped so I could start in the
[3:24:08] right place because I have done some
[3:24:10] preaching since I've been away. And I
[3:24:12] happened to just fast forward and I came
[3:24:15] to to one place in in that sermon
[3:24:20] that I feel like is helpful.
[3:24:24] And it was when the three Hebrew
[3:24:26] children
[3:24:28] said,
[3:24:30] "Lord, we we don't know for sure, you
[3:24:32] know, what's going to happen." Oh, king,
[3:24:34] it could be
[3:24:37] that our God will deliver us. We're not
[3:24:40] sure exactly how he's going to handle
[3:24:42] this, but we trust him.
[3:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:24:45] &gt;&gt; And we know that he's well aable.
[3:24:48] &gt;&gt; You all believe he was able?
[3:24:50] &gt;&gt; You believe he came down?
[3:24:51] &gt;&gt; Yes. Do
[3:24:52] &gt;&gt; you believe he got in the fire with him?
[3:24:54] &gt;&gt; We're going to ask the God of heaven to
[3:24:56] get in the fire
[3:24:58] &gt;&gt; to get in the battle
[3:25:00] &gt;&gt; and and and to stand in the flame
[3:25:03] &gt;&gt; of this of this threat, and we're going
[3:25:05] to ask him to answer what we cannot
[3:25:07] answer.
[3:25:08] &gt;&gt; Now, of course, they'll do everything
[3:25:10] they know to do, but but
[3:25:12] &gt;&gt; it's going to have to be that God would
[3:25:14] answer this. He's got to move.
[3:25:16] &gt;&gt; So, I've put the Bible on the letter
[3:25:18] because the letter is not our business.
[3:25:20] He asked me to look over just a minute
[3:25:22] and I did.
[3:25:23] &gt;&gt; But that word is our authority
[3:25:26] &gt;&gt; and we're putting it on top
[3:25:28] &gt;&gt; of all those other words
[3:25:30] &gt;&gt; and we're believing now. You lay your
[3:25:31] hands on it. Those of you who can and
[3:25:34] let's believe [music]
[3:25:35] that God will move in supernatural ways.
[3:25:38] Father, I I believe this is exactly
[3:25:41] right. I believe this is exactly what
[3:25:45] you would have us to do. And if you've
[3:25:47] led us in this way for our brother and
[3:25:50] sister and family, then Lord, you must
[3:25:54] have something in mind. SO WE'RE ASKING
[3:25:57] YOU, GOD of angel armies.
[3:26:01] We're asking you, Adonite Zeot, the Lord
[3:26:05] of hosts. We're asking you to answer
[3:26:09] every jot, every tit, every
[3:26:13] exaggeration,
[3:26:14] every lie, every gouge in the name of
[3:26:18] Jesus Christ.
[3:26:21] &gt;&gt; Lord, let your word settle the matter.
[3:26:25] &gt;&gt; You said that your word is forever
[3:26:30] settled
[3:26:31] &gt;&gt; and YOU SAID THAT HEAVEN and earth will
[3:26:35] pass away. but that your word will abide
[3:26:40] forever.
[3:26:41] &gt;&gt; And now, Lord, somebody might look on
[3:26:44] and say, "This is a personal thing, and
[3:26:47] you're making it a a a Bible, corporate,
[3:26:51] believing thing." That's what we have to
[3:26:53] do.
[3:26:54] &gt;&gt; That's what we have to do BECAUSE THE
[3:26:56] ENEMY WILL TOUCH EVERY one of us in a
[3:26:59] personal way. He will again and again
[3:27:01] and again and again. AND THOSE
[3:27:03] CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE DIFFERENT each
[3:27:05] time for each person. The answer will
[3:27:08] always be the same. GREATER IS HE THAT
[3:27:12] IS IN US than he that is in the world.
[3:27:15] &gt;&gt; Now Lord, I know enough about this
[3:27:17] situation to know that they have done
[3:27:20] nothing wrong. They have only done what
[3:27:22] they were supposed to do. And others
[3:27:25] have not kept their part. And this is
[3:27:29] somebody wanting to take advantage of
[3:27:33] every Kleenex and every Tylenol and and
[3:27:37] every pill and every throw up pan like
[3:27:40] sometimes we've seen on the hospital
[3:27:43] bill. It's overdone
[3:27:47] and it's usery. And we're believing that
[3:27:51] the Lord Jesus Christ will break the
[3:27:56] feather and the yoke and give victory.
[3:27:59] And we command fear.
[3:28:02] &gt;&gt; Fear is a human response.
[3:28:04] &gt;&gt; But we command that that fear be
[3:28:08] answered
[3:28:09] &gt;&gt; yes
[3:28:09] &gt;&gt; by the faith
[3:28:11] &gt;&gt; of God.
[3:28:12] &gt;&gt; And we say the word, the word will rise.
[3:28:16] And we say no weapon formed against Josh
[3:28:22] and charity shall prosper
[3:28:26] &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ
[3:28:27] &gt;&gt; but that your word will accomplish what
[3:28:31] it is sent forth to accomplish in the
[3:28:34] name of Jesus Christ. So the answer is
[3:28:37] the word.
[3:28:39] &gt;&gt; Your word answers the [music] inquiry.
[3:28:41] Your word answers the accusation. Your
[3:28:45] word answers the threat. And and that's
[3:28:47] right. Your word answers the extortion
[3:28:50] in the mighty, precious, holy name of
[3:28:53] Jesus Christ.
[3:28:55] It it's just like the authorities told
[3:28:57] them, "Don't don't speak in that name.
[3:29:00] Don't operate in that name." And and you
[3:29:03] told them, "Go on and do it anyway."
[3:29:05] [music]
[3:29:06] You gave them strength to keep doing
[3:29:08] what was right. And Lord, [music] I pray
[3:29:11] that our brother will find strength to
[3:29:14] keep doing what is right and that you
[3:29:16] will answer.
[3:29:17] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[3:29:18] &gt;&gt; and it's not too late.
[3:29:21] It's not too late. May the Araba of
[3:29:24] heaven open,
[3:29:26] the slle gates of justice open, and may
[3:29:30] [music] the Holy One, the Ancient of
[3:29:32] Days, render today a just decree.
[3:29:36] [music]
[3:29:37] &gt;&gt; Yes. on behalf of our brother and
[3:29:39] sister.
[3:29:40] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:29:40] &gt;&gt; That says, "Lord, we don't know how. We
[3:29:43] don't know exactly in what [music]
[3:29:45] direction the hope and answer will come,
[3:29:48] but we're going to believe and we're
[3:29:50] going to praise you now. We're going to
[3:29:51] thank you now. We're going to believe
[3:29:52] you now that your word settles this
[3:29:55] thing in the precious name of the Lord
[3:29:57] Jesus Christ." Just leave it there a
[3:29:59] minute or two and let the word uh set on
[3:30:03] top of it.
[3:30:04] When the enemy cometh in uh like a
[3:30:07] flood,
[3:30:09] he the spirit will raise up a standard
[3:30:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:30:14] &gt;&gt; against him. Oh, hallelujah.
[3:30:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Sing with me. I believe God.
[3:30:21] Sing with me. Those of you that have
[3:30:23] chosen to remain, you're dismissed to go
[3:30:26] in the mighty name of the Lord. Hand me
[3:30:28] the little notebook somewhere and
[3:30:30] [music] let me say what's on it real
[3:30:32] quick.
[3:30:33] We're just settled in here comfortable.
[3:30:37] Uh, Tuesday is Amelia Caroline's
[3:30:40] birthday. She's turning 10. It's
[3:30:43] Jonathan Hollis's birthday. He's turning
[3:30:45] old. Uh, it's also the day that Sister
[3:30:48] Hattie Wright [music] spoke the right
[3:30:50] word. Praise God. May we say the right
[3:30:53] word today. It's also Veterans Day.
[3:30:56] Thank God for everyone who has served
[3:30:58] our nation. And then Friday uh uh
[3:31:01] November 14th, two birthdays. We have
[3:31:04] Sister Jada and Sister Jennifer
[3:31:06] Jernigan. May God bless them again and
[3:31:10] again and again on their birthday. Next
[3:31:12] [music] Sunday is our Thanksgiving meal
[3:31:14] together. Be ready for the list to come
[3:31:16] out. Let's sing this.
[3:31:19] I believe God. I believe God. Ask what
[3:31:24] you [music] will. It shall be done
[3:31:27] and obey. Believe [music] God and say,
[3:31:34] [music] "Oh, I believe God. I believe
[3:31:38] God." Ask.
[3:31:42] Oh, trust and obey. [music]
[3:31:45] Believe God and say, "I believe. I
[3:31:48] believe God." Oh,
[3:31:51] I believe God. [music]
[3:31:58] Oh, trust and obey.
[3:32:03] &gt;&gt; I believe [music] I believe God.
[3:32:06] [singing]
[3:32:07] &gt;&gt; Do you really believe him?
[3:32:09] &gt;&gt; If you do, wave your hand.
[3:32:11] &gt;&gt; I really, really, really believe God.
[3:32:16] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know that it was his idea.
[3:32:19] Doesn't matter whose idea it was, but
[3:32:22] but
[3:32:24] Joshua Yantis is one of the most private
[3:32:27] people I've ever [music] known. And it
[3:32:31] took a lot for him to walk up here and
[3:32:34] lay his business out and and draw the
[3:32:37] attention. But it's the right thing. You
[3:32:40] have done the right thing. We have done
[3:32:43] the right thing.
[3:32:44] &gt;&gt; We're a family.
[3:32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's time for us to handle
[3:32:48] [clears throat] it like kingdom uh
[3:32:50] ambassadors, right?
[3:32:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you as you leave today
[3:32:55] in the lovely name of the Lord Jesus.
[3:32:57] Let's leave it a little while longer.
[3:32:59] And and let's believe God. I want to
[3:33:01] sing as as they're leaving. Uh he signed
[3:33:04] my debt. And the reason why is because
[3:33:08] as we were praying, I saw the enemy
[3:33:10] retreating. And this was a song that
[3:33:12] come to my mind.
[3:33:17] He signed my day
[3:33:20] with his redeeming blood. He ever
[3:33:24] [singing]
[3:33:25] lives to make his promise [music] good.
[3:33:29] When all the host of hell march in to
[3:33:33] make a second claim, they all [singing]
[3:33:37] march out at the mention of his name. He
[3:33:42] signed [music and singing] my dear debt
[3:33:45] with his atoning blood. He ever lives
[3:33:50] [singing]
[3:33:51] to make his promise good. When all the
[3:33:55] host of hell march in to make a second
[3:33:59] claim, they all [music] march out at the
[3:34:03] mention of his name again. He signed my
[3:34:08] debt with his atoning blood. He
[3:34:13] [singing] ever lives to make his promise
[3:34:17] good. When all the hosts of hell march
[3:34:21] in to make a second claim, they all
[3:34:26] march out at the mention of his name.
[3:34:29] again. He [music] signed my debt with
[3:34:34] his atoning blood. He ever lives to make
[3:34:40] his promise good. When all the host of
[3:34:44] hell march in to [music and singing]
[3:34:46] make a second claim, they all march out.
[3:34:51] had to mention of his name. The last
[3:34:54] time he signed my debt with his blood,
[3:35:00] he ever [music and singing]
[3:35:02] lives to make his promise good. When all
[3:35:07] the host of hell march in to make a
[3:35:10] second claim, they all
[3:35:13] [music and singing] march out at the
[3:35:15] mention of his name. They all
[3:35:19] [music and singing] march out at the
[3:35:22] mention of his name. They [music] all
[3:35:26] march out at the mention of his name.
[3:35:32] God bless you. Enjoy the rest of your
[3:35:35] day.
[3:35:37] Praise the Lord.
[3:35:44] &gt;&gt; What are all these people looking at?
[3:35:46] Huh?
