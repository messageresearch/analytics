TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I [Music] praise the Lord I'm pastor Stephen Shelley and I want to welcome you to the Eagles cry I just pray that the Lord will speak to you today from his word as we study together the wonderful words of life I am so thankful to God that He has given us the record of his word the Holy Bible and its life it's absolutely life to me and I find myself some time thinking of how I can reorder my day so that I can spend more time in God's Word if God's word has not become a living book to you yet it can perhaps the enemy is blocking your mind and it seems like it's just a dead letter to you then I just pray that the Lord will release and impart to you a hunger a spiritual hunger because the truth in God's Word can be like a dead letter unless the Spirit comes to make his word alive in you and I just asked him I just feel right now just to say Lord let your spirit quicken your word to those who have a desire to study and to know your word but feel blocked in their minds I just break off right now in the name of Jesus those heavy bands of oppression against your mind that would keep you from receiving the truth of God's Word and I just say Lord let there be a flow over you right now of his spirit a river of his spirit making a clear channel for you to receive revelation knowledge this is an hour of great revelation knowledge based on God's Word and I want you to be a part of it please contact our ministry if you will the information will be given to you on the screen how you can get in contact with us send us your prayer requests let us know where you're watching the eagles cry and it'll be a great blessing to us we we certainly enjoy hearing from you and knowing that we've been able to sew into your life in a positive way that's why we're here we're not here to promote ourselves our church or our ministry we're here representing the kingdom of God we're here representing the Lord Jesus Christ and we want to we want to represent him well we want to represent him in truth I believe that's very important and I know that many of you do and that's why you are so faithful to tuning in week after week you either see this on the television or you stream it on the Internet some of you watch these programs by podcasts some of you purchase the dvds and that's how you see the Eagles cry however you're watching I pray that you'll be blessed today let's look right to God's Word shall we I want to read today from Hebrews chapter 5 verse 8 and 9 we're doing a study together on exercising the senses of our spirit and I just wish that I had time this is the fourth program in the series and I wished I had time to just go back and cover it all again because i think the foundation of where we're going is is a good foundation and i think what we shared today would mean a whole lot more to you if you could hear the other parts and so if you are interested you could contact our ministry it's not expensive to get the DVD set that will be made available and you could watch the whole thing and I don't normally say things like that i mean people know me and they know that i don't normally do that but i really do believe for in my heart that there are some truths that God is showing us in his word that are going to bring transformation in your life and some keys so that we can come to a place that we allow Jesus Christ to sit on the throne of our spirit and rule and reign have dominion over our soul and over our body because remember we're trying in nature body soul and spirit Hebrews chapter five verse eight and nine said though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered we're speaking about Mashiach Messiah the Lord Jesus Christ though he were a son and he was indeed the Son of God yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered do you see there was a process there was progress there there was a development of his perfection he was coming into his place of full adoption and perfection remember in the Bible when the Lord Jesus went to the Jordan River to be baptized by John the heavens opened up a dove came down the Holy Spirit came in the form of a dove and a voice from heaven this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell or the King James says in whom I am well pleased other translations say in whom I am pleased to dwell and I like that very much very important words of affirmation spoken aloud over the Messiah then we read where he went to a high mountain with his disciples and his inner circle Peter James and John went with him they went up into this high mountain and he was transfigured he was glorified he was changed before their eyes his face was shining like the light of the Sun his raiment was even changed and glistened like gold and a voice spoke and said this is my beloved son hear ye him we understand through Bible history that there was an adoption process that took place in the Hebrew home the boy the oldest son though he were a son he had to prove himself there were some requirements and in the Jewish home today there is a celebration of coming to spiritual manhood or spiritual maturity called a Bar Mitzvah for a young girl it's called a bat mitzvah our bat mitzvah bat mitzvah and so this is a very very interesting concept that even our Lord Jesus made this progress he went through a process though he were a son not just any son the son of God yet he learned obedience total full obedience full surrender by the things which he suffered so you just remember when you're going through the process of suffering when your knowing turmoil and trials and hardship the enemy is really seemingly out there quipping things up in your life remember it is a part of your obedience training God is looking I feel the anointing right now God is looking for a people that will obey him that will move in unquestioning obedience yes Lord yes Lord what would you have me to do yes Lord where would you have me to go yes Lord what would you have me to say I believe that's going to be very important in this day in which we're coming as the sons of God into full adoption that we move into that place of of quick obedience where we don't have time do you know beg for further direction or understanding we just step out and you know sometimes that's very important in obedience God will reveal to us one step and as we step out to do that to obey that here comes further instruction so we don't just sit around and wait on the whole story the whole plan but when God gives us a piece of the puzzle we move out to do that part to put that piece into play believing that God would give us the rest that he will verse 9 and being made perfect made perfect meaning there was also a process of perfection and what that was it was the pulling down of the will of the flesh though we were God though he were God yet he was in a body of flesh that had a will that had a motion that desire and being made perfect he became the author Oh hallelujah the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey Him did you notice the way that is didn't you say unto all those that believe under all those that repaired under all those that go to church it says unto all them that obey Him so obedience is very important in this process of developing our spirit we talked about how and I've just got to say this quickly we talked about how Adam God breathed breath into his nostrils ooh we read that right out of the Bible Genesis chapter 2 I think it was verse verse 7 the Lord formed him out of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life man became a living soul we talked about how Adam received both so life and spirit life and how that the soul is so nourished and and it gets so fat because it receives so much we receive so much into our soul through those avenues that we talked about last week memories imagination conscious affection and reasoning so much going on into our soul but our little spirit man is weak and Adam once communicated with god's spirit to spirit the ability to do so was lost in the fall when Jesus died on Calvary and paid the price then our spirit has become regenerated renewed but it must be developed we have to develop our spiritual senses so that we can come to that place where can once again walk in oneness Union and communion with God like Adam did spirit to spirit and the reason why we're doing this program today is we're talking about the fact that it is a process our spirit man must be developed built up strengthened brought into a place where we can live out of our spirit and not out of our soul or our flesh so we read Hebrews five and eight and nine five eight and nine to help substantiate the need for a process if our Lord Jesus went through a process where he developed his obedience then you and I will also go through a process where we develop our obedience where we develop our dependency on him and we get into divine alignment so that we don't live out of the will of the flesh or even the will of the soul but out of the will of God which rules through our human spirit Romans 8 29 for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son there is a conforming there is a molding a shaping a honing in and a lot of that has not happened in our spirit man you've got to be on the right atmosphere you've got to be under the right teaching you've got to have the right understanding for your spirit man to be developed because the soul of man is sort of hungry and it likes to to soak up all that we hear it likes to take up all that we hear the problem with the soul is that it filters everything that we hear through these different doorways that we talked about last week we want the word of god and the truth that we come in contact with to go beyond the flesh to move through the soul and into the human spirit the spirit that has been regenerated potentially back to the place Adam spirit was it was the essence of God it was the life of God it was the very deity the very nature of God and we have been called the Bible said and I'll share this verse of scripture with you also in another lesson but we have been called to be partakers of the what divine nature we've been called to this brother this is not just us trying to usurp our place in the kingdom we have been called we're living in the last days God has an overcoming body of people that are being raised up a holy remnant and we're being called to come into that relationship where we communicate with our Creator spirit to spirit to be conformed tells us that it's a process that a process is required that it's not instantaneous that we come into that place of total obedience and surrender it's not instantaneous that we live out of our spirit it is a process and it takes exercise and development and we're going to keep on until we come to a place of understanding how to do that we are predestinated to be conformed to his image what does that mean it means to be spiritually mature spiritually mature to come into the stature of a perfect man or the fullness of Jesus Christ in flesh we've looked at that before on the Eagles cry so we won't have time to go very deeply into that right now but I want to share another scripture with you first Peter chapter 1 the first part of verse 2 said elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit through sanctification of the spirit to obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Peter is saying that it is just as important that our spirit be sanctified as it is for us to receive the blood sacrifice in other words we we come we have to have the blood the blood is what redeems us the blood is the bridal price the blood is the token for our salvation it is without blood there is no shedding without blood there is no remission of sin without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin but equally important Peter said is that our spirit be sanctified think about it that word here means purification or holiness elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through purification through holiness of the spirit through sanctification of the spirit so now the Bible tells us here there is a process by which our spirit must be set apart there is a process whereby our spirit must be purified it must come into a place of purity how does that happen by the holiness of God God is holy he is so holy our minds can yet fathom or wrap around the true holiness of God but I believe God wants to release to us his holiness he wants to impart to us a measure of his holiness that will sanctify and set your spirit man apart from your soul from your flesh the spirit is to be set apart from the soul and from the flesh and we read that right there if you want to look at that again its first Peter chapter 1 and the first part of verse 2 when we come short of this when we come short of having our spirit sanctified we're forgiven through the blood of Jesus and we can move again forward toward this goal we've had many setbacks over our Christian journey we start working on the inner issues of sanctification we start working on the inner issues of deliverance of being broken free from all generational curses all things that have come down to us from prior generations we start working on that we are making some progress with living life abundantly and what happens inadvertently every time the enemy brings us into a place of temptation and testing and we seemingly lose ground but I want to tell you something we must keep on keeping on we must come back to the Father we must come back boldly to the throne of grace and say Lord if it was not available you shouldn't have let me read it in the word that's how I feel if this was not for me it shouldn't have been in the word I don't believe God is a God that dangles a carrot in front of our face that we can never eat do you I don't I believe if it's in the book I can have it if it's in the Word of God it is part of my destiny and I'm going to pursue it not not to think that I can do it on my own don't you think by any means that I'm saying that our spirit is sanctified by our works it's all by grace it's all by grace God gives us the grace to even come to the understanding that we need that so it's all by grace but there is a process and there there are exercises there are ways of exercising our spirit man nourishing our spirit man so that he grows up and so that he takes his place instead of being ruled by the flesh now that's how temptation works it we're tempted through our flesh we're ensnared by our soul and we end up involved with things that we know are not pleasing to God but if our spirit man was ruling our life if we were living out of our spirit then when the enemy came to tempt our flesh to try to penetrate our soul that's when our spirit would raise up with a hammer and cracker our flesh the will of our flesh kind of over there and say wait a minute you get back in the line you get back into your proper place so you get back into your proper place body flesh you get back into your position it's time for by an alignment spirit soul and body so I tell you I really believe God is going to do some mighty things in our lives as we grasp some of this so don't be discouraged if you try and fail if you mess up if you if you allow the enemy to distract you just catch yourself and quickly come back Philippians chapter 3 and i'm going to read several verses here verses 12 through 16 and I'm going to read them in the New King James Version because they're a little bit complicated and I want you to get them the Apostle said not that I have already attained or am already perfected see he saw that perfection is something to be attained something that he had not yet developed fully but I press on here that don't you be discouraged press on that I may lay hold this is his testimony that I may lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus has also laid hold of me brethren I do not count myself to have apprehended but one thing I do here's part of the key here's part of bring bringing the soul into submission for getting those things which are behind remember one of the ways the enemy wants to rule your soul is by penetrating it through bad memory through bad memory memories of things you've done memories of things that that that haunt you you know memories can be haunting and you've got a you've got to have grace to forget those things because memories quickly turn into accusation you start thinking of things and the first thing you know the enemy is jumping up and down on your memory accusing you of being that same person and hopefully by the grace of God you're not that same man or that same woman you used to be forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are ahead I press say that with me I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call I like the way the new key James says it the upward call of god in christ jesus king james says the high calling which is also very important in a good way of expressing it but I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of god in christ jesus do you hear that upward call you hear God calling you out of the realm of the flesh out of the realm of the soul to live out of your spirit that has been rejuven i regenerate 'add by the Holy Spirit of God I believe you're hearing the call therefore let us as many as are mature have this mine this is how mature people think and if anything you think otherwise God will reveal even this to you nevertheless to the degree that we have already attained because there are some things we have grown into let us walk by the same rule let us be off the same mind now I want you to know that the mind is very connected with the spirit the spirit and the mind are very connected and so our mind must be renewed daily we have to bring thoughts under subjection we have to work in our mind and the mind and the spirit is very connected so when you read scriptures about the mind I believe those words of promise and instruction are interchangeable with the human spirit I really believe that not all Christians I've noticed have that deep burning desire to press toward the goal for the price of the upward call of god this opportunity this invitation is conditional it's conditional everyone may not get it but if you get it you need to respond to it if there is a deep yearning in you that means there's something deep out there to respond to that deep call if there's a pulling a wooing a drawing it means there's something out there to fulfill that drawing Revelation chapter 3 and verse 21 will probably be the last verse I get to share with you today to him that overcomes will I grant to sit now some some people ask does that mean that this is for everybody no that's not what this said it didn't say everybody will get such and such and us it says to him that over comes they're going to be people who overcome in all things and they're going to be people who don't overcome in all things somebody said are there going to be Christians who don't overcome in all things I believe there are I believe there are I believe they're going to be foolish virgins I believe they're going to be people who do all that they can do but simply have not been called to this place of overcoming grace you see I believe clearly the scripture teaches there's a church and there's a bride of Christ and i know this is controversial to a lot of people but i didn't write the book i didn't i didn't write the book i didn't make this up out of my head this is the word of God God said here in Revelation chapter 3 verse 21 speaking to the church to him that over comes to think that every person in a local church is going to come to that place of overcoming it's just not going to be that way to him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne there's something about that terminology in my throne that that speaks of joining into his authority even Oh as I also overcame here's another verse that says there was a process there was a testing there was a temptation in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ but he found himself obedient he overcame and to him that overcomes like the Lord Jesus well I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and then set down with my father in his throne Matthew 2214 I'll share that one quickly for many are called but few are chosen I believe many of you watching this program today are chosen not for nominal Christianity not just to be a pew warmer somewhere not just to be a part of the of the of the whole picture you know just blend it in with with those who name the name of the Lord but I believe many of you are called to overcome I believe there's a hunger being stirred in your spirit man right now for the higher things of God and I want to pray I want to pray right now and I want to ask the Lord to do something extraordinary in your life father I just pray right now for those who are watching this program I don't know who is I don't know who is not I don't know who you're dealing with and who you're not dealing with I don't assume that every person watching this program is able to connect with what I'm saying but I do discern that many are and I ask you right now to send forth the power of the Holy Spirit to take this word of God deep into their spirit to feed their spirit to nourish their spirit to cause their spirit to be exercised and developed to bring us closer to that place of oneness and fellowship with you like Adam had where he communicated with you O Father spirit to spirit lord I ask you also for healing and for deliverance I ask you to bring about a change in circumstances of people's lives that are watching this program right now so distracted with circumstance so distracted with hardship in their life and yet father you're a loving merciful tender God and I asked you to send grace release grace to the hero right now Oh father I just believe Lord that you're doing a wonderful word in people's lives even now and I thank you for it we ask these things in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah amen any man well thank you i pray that you've got something out of this broadcast today we're going to continue the series the next time you tune in we're going to move a little bit farther into this and see where the Lord will take us thank you for watching the Eagles cry and tune in again next time bye bye for now [Music] you [Music] you you
