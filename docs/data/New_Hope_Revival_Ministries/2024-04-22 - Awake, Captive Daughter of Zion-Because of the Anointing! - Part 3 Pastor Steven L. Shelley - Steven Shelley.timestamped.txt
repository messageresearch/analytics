[1:00:44] of evangelism is we just have
[1:00:49] babies they've all got to get here all
[1:00:51] those seed all those predestinated seed
[1:00:53] have got to get here before you get out
[1:00:55] of here
[1:00:56] that's right and so God's bringing them
[1:00:59] and it seems like they're coming pretty
[1:01:01] quick these days and I got to meet
[1:01:04] Isaiah River and he is a doll and he the
[1:01:09] first picture I saw I thought he looked
[1:01:12] exactly like Anna Christine and his big
[1:01:15] sister Gwyn and I still think after
[1:01:19] seeing him in person yesterday he does
[1:01:23] however I did get five or six pictures
[1:01:26] this morning from Brother Austin
[1:01:30] Hodges who were sent to him from his
[1:01:37] mother and I had to humbly
[1:01:41] confess that I could see a tad a
[1:01:46] bit every dad wants to be there and
[1:01:50] it'll come it will come it doesn't
[1:01:53] matter the first few hours or days
[1:01:56] they change so fast and uh so I want to
[1:02:01] I want to well this was oldfashioned
[1:02:03] Sunday we just didn't tell you to wear
[1:02:05] your bonnets but I guess you heard in
[1:02:07] the singing that Benjamin has been to a
[1:02:10] Gaither concert this week and so we were
[1:02:13] walking down memory lane for all of
[1:02:15] those of you who that's not your cup of
[1:02:17] tea well we'll try to give you another
[1:02:19] flavor when you're here the next time
[1:02:21] but it it's it's mine I have to be
[1:02:24] honest uh uh that I wouldn't take
[1:02:27] nothing for a journey now some of you
[1:02:29] aren't old enough to have had a
[1:02:31] journey but you'll get one and when you
[1:02:35] do you'll be able to look back and say
[1:02:37] through the through the trials through
[1:02:39] the through the those moments of
[1:02:42] hopelessness when you felt like you you
[1:02:44] were just didn't want to live and he
[1:02:47] stepped in and brought you a little
[1:02:49] closer to him we have so much to be
[1:02:52] thankful for and I appreciate my kids uh
[1:02:55] taking me I wasn't physically able to go

[1:03:37] senior citizens trying to figure out how
[1:03:40] to turn their their flashlights
[1:03:45] on and when the when the when this real
[1:03:48] song with a real special meaning would
[1:03:50] come on they would take their their
[1:03:53] cameras out and their phones out and
[1:03:55] they would wave it back and forth and it
[1:03:57] it was real pretty you turn around and
[1:03:59] and it looks real good and you see you

[1:04:28] before and to and and really to have no
[1:04:31] regrets to know you've given your life

[1:08:57] we also have greetings coming in from
[1:09:00] many places around the world of great
[1:09:03] group of Believers in Kenya are joining
[1:09:06] us now and uh Philippines and I don't
[1:09:11] know where all it's hard to tell
[1:09:14] sometime unless they unless they write
[1:09:16] it
[1:09:20] in someone from
[1:09:23] Massachusetts a pillar of fire
[1:09:26] Tabernacle somewhere in looks like South
[1:09:28] America also
[1:09:30] Norway uh Indiana South Africa there
[1:09:35] many places thank you thank you for for
[1:09:37] being with
[1:09:38] us Romans chapter 8 and verse 11 but if
[1:09:44] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[1:09:50] from the dead dwell in you
[1:09:59] if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:10:03] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:10:06] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:10:10] also Quicken make alive that's the word
[1:10:16] in Greek make alive resurrect your
[1:10:20] mortal Body by his spirit that dwelleth
[1:10:25] in you amen that's Resurrection life and
[1:10:29] that is anastasis life and that
[1:10:32] anastasis life is not just resurrecting
[1:10:36] from the from the actual dead being in a
[1:10:39] grave of physical natural grave and
[1:10:42] getting up but it is a continual this is
[1:10:46] what I love it is a continual quickening
[1:10:50] it is a continual
[1:10:52] unction it's a continual Resurrection
[1:10:55] and when they were trying to take it
[1:10:57] from the Greek and express it in English
[1:11:00] it was said that it is a
[1:11:04] reproducible a
[1:11:06] duplicatable
[1:11:08] resurrection aren't you glad that his
[1:11:11] resurrection is a duplicatable
[1:11:15] resurrection it is a reproducible
[1:11:17] resurrection and it's in
[1:11:20] us I I noticed when brother Cade was
[1:11:22] singing that he said I'm the New
[1:11:24] Testament
[1:11:25] church now you've been listening to the
[1:11:28] message because many times a prophet
[1:11:30] would tell us make that personal I'm a
[1:11:33] New Testament Church rising up because
[1:11:36] the church is not the four walls the
[1:11:39] church is you you're the house that the
[1:11:41] Lord is dwelling in would would you
[1:11:44] would you remain standing for just one
[1:11:46] more verse if you're able and that is
[1:11:48] Isaiah 60 we were on this Tuesday night
[1:11:52] and uh let let me hit this again and
[1:11:55] this this is from the Amplified and here
[1:11:57] it says arise from the
[1:12:00] depression and
[1:12:02] prostration you know what that means
[1:12:05] depression is to be pressed down and
[1:12:08] prostration is to be
[1:12:12] flat knocked down
[1:12:15] flat rise from being knocked down and
[1:12:19] flat in which circumstances
[1:12:23] have have kept
[1:12:25] you it it's it's normal that hardship
[1:12:30] may cause us to waver a
[1:12:33] bit it may anoint our doubt and we may
[1:12:37] have to bring that under control but it
[1:12:40] is not normal for a Spirit-filled
[1:12:42] believer to want to stay
[1:12:45] there if you find yourself pressed down
[1:12:48] and you want to stay there you need more
[1:12:50] of that reproducible
[1:12:52] Resurrection come on you need more of
[1:12:55] that quickening life and and let me tell
[1:12:58] you something brother sister there's
[1:12:59] more of it for
[1:13:01] us now I know some are offended I know
[1:13:04] you're
[1:13:05] standing uh but I know some are offended
[1:13:07] when you hear like a song this morning
[1:13:10] uh there's a new and a fresh
[1:13:13] anointing because they've got this idea
[1:13:15] there's nothing new nothing new nothing
[1:13:17] new nothing new what you don't
[1:13:19] understand is the same anointing it's
[1:13:22] not a brand new anointing it's moving in
[1:13:25] you in a fresh way amen and and you know
[1:13:29] it will it'll it'll do that sometimes it
[1:13:31] makes us
[1:13:33] creative that anointing makes us
[1:13:36] creative it causes us to to be artistic
[1:13:40] or or to be better organized and we've
[1:13:42] been anointed for that and then other
[1:13:46] times it it might anoint us to to to
[1:13:48] write uh words from the Lord from his
[1:13:52] heart on paper and and go back and read
[1:13:56] them and be blessed by them later it
[1:13:58] might cause a songwriter to write a song
[1:14:02] it might cause someone to come to church
[1:14:04] with an extra uh extra Hallelujah in his
[1:14:07] step it's all the same logos it's all
[1:14:10] the same Christ but he can he can engage
[1:14:15] with you and you can engage with him in
[1:14:17] a in a fresh way and it feels brand new
[1:14:21] oh hallelujah how many of you need a
[1:14:23] brand new touch
[1:14:25] oh I hear ly wolf when I say that Lord
[1:14:28] you know I need a brand new touch my
[1:14:33] strength from yesterday is
[1:14:37] gone and if you Lord will give me
[1:14:40] another touch I will find strength to
[1:14:45] carry on we need it yes we need it so
[1:14:50] arise from the depression and
[1:14:52] prostration in which circumstances have
[1:14:55] kept you rise to a hello New Life
[1:15:03] shine look at somebody
[1:15:06] shine tell them
[1:15:08] shine be radiant with the glory of the
[1:15:12] Lord you know sometimes you see Holiness
[1:15:15] people out and they look so
[1:15:23] mean they got the bun but they but
[1:15:26] they're mean looking mean
[1:15:30] looking God's people should be the
[1:15:33] smiling happiest people on the face of
[1:15:36] the Earth not because they don't have
[1:15:38] any problem but because they got
[1:15:39] somebody carrying
[1:15:41] them shine be radiant with the glory of
[1:15:45] the Lord and you can just imagine how
[1:15:47] they look at me with
[1:15:49] whiskers as the apostolic church has
[1:15:51] rejected the new Old Testament order of
[1:15:54] those kinds of things you know and so
[1:15:55] they really look at you like who are you
[1:15:57] you're just a bum but you know it
[1:15:59] doesn't matter does it we're going to
[1:16:01] shine anyway be radiant with the glory
[1:16:04] of the Lord for your
[1:16:09] light him he has come and the glory of
[1:16:13] the
[1:16:18] Lord anybody glad for it father we thank
[1:16:22] you today for your precious word it's
[1:16:25] life to us not just once a week not just
[1:16:28] twice a week but every time we engage
[1:16:31] your word every time we hear the
[1:16:34] prophet's tape every time we read it for
[1:16:37] ourself every time we hear an anointed
[1:16:39] man of God speaking it forth in unction
[1:16:43] we are lifted up your word is more than
[1:16:46] bread to us it's also meat to us and
[1:16:50] when we when we when we needed milk it
[1:16:53] has been milk to us us and we want to
[1:16:56] thank you for that it's a healing bomb
[1:16:59] it it's oil on a dry parched heart your
[1:17:02] word is everything that we need and you
[1:17:06] are the manifestation of that word and
[1:17:10] you are calling us to be the present uh
[1:17:17] manifestation of your word and it seems
[1:17:20] like a bigger job than we are capable of
[1:17:23] doing but you have promised it and you
[1:17:27] are the one who is bringing it to pass
[1:17:30] and we want to thank you for helping us
[1:17:32] today as we look to your word in the
[1:17:34] precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:17:37] we pray and the Saints said amen you may
[1:17:40] be seated but stay with me if you can
[1:17:43] and help us to get through this numbers
[1:17:45] if you'll go there
[1:17:49] honey chapter
[1:17:52] 19 beginning in verse one and let's
[1:17:55] catch four verses
[1:17:58] there and the Lord spake unto
[1:18:02] Moses and unto Aaron
[1:18:06] saying this is the
[1:18:11] ordinance uh did I lose my
[1:18:15] place this is the ordinance of the law
[1:18:19] which the Lord hath commanded saying
[1:18:23] Speak unto the children children of
[1:18:25] Israel that they bring thee a red
[1:18:29] heer without spot where in is no
[1:18:36] blemish and upon which never came a
[1:18:42] yoke I I want to
[1:18:45] emphasize that phrase and upon which
[1:18:49] never came a yoke we have for the past
[1:18:55] three
[1:18:56] services we have talked about that yoke
[1:19:00] Isaiah tells us that because of the
[1:19:05] anointing the yoke
[1:19:09] is say it out destroyed not
[1:19:14] broken because broken you know you can
[1:19:16] fix anything with crazy glue and Gorilla
[1:19:20] Glue and and if if one touch of that
[1:19:23] anointing just breaks that yoke I tell
[1:19:26] you the devil's already on the way to
[1:19:28] the church house to try to glue it back
[1:19:30] together and put it on your shoulder he
[1:19:33] wants to be your
[1:19:35] Taskmaster he can't change your Eternal
[1:19:38] destination but Satan wants you to do
[1:19:41] his
[1:19:42] bidding he can't change your your
[1:19:45] relationship with God he can hinder your
[1:19:48] fellowship but he can't change your
[1:19:50] relationship but what he'd like to do is
[1:19:52] take a Believer and yoke them up with
[1:19:56] all kinds of different uh uh you know
[1:19:59] things weights
[1:20:02] hindrances and in doing so they become a
[1:20:06] a spreader of negativity instead of
[1:20:10] spreader of Faith come on they're
[1:20:13] children of God they've had a born again
[1:20:15] experience but they've gotten cold in
[1:20:18] their experience and and Jesus said well
[1:20:21] I would that you were either hot or cold
[1:20:23] but the lukewarm spew out of my mouth so
[1:20:26] you don't want to be in that lukewarm
[1:20:28] place you don't want to be in a cold
[1:20:29] place you want to stay as fiery hot for
[1:20:32] the king as you possibly can amen and
[1:20:36] when we get lukewarm or cold and we get
[1:20:38] in the negative Zone and faith is not
[1:20:41] our vocabulary anymore we're still
[1:20:43] children of God we're just going through
[1:20:47] something and it becomes a yoke on our
[1:20:50] shoulder and we need that
[1:20:53] anointing I'm going to preach to you
[1:20:55] with me we need that
[1:20:59] manifested presence of the Lord amen the
[1:21:04] word alone can't get it all done oh
[1:21:08] that's what the Bible said don't get
[1:21:10] that look on your face you know this
[1:21:13] Bible even a message book can become a
[1:21:18] dead letter if you adopt it as a
[1:21:22] Creed it it's it's it's the
[1:21:25] anointing it's the Living Word that
[1:21:29] delivers and sets free and that Bible
[1:21:33] and this message that we have we're so
[1:21:35] thankful and grateful for it but it is
[1:21:38] to us a a a written record or now A
[1:21:43] Spoken record of God's word I'm not
[1:21:47] going to debate with you this morning
[1:21:49] about whether it is equal to or not but
[1:21:51] I will tell you it's a dangerous thing
[1:21:54] to get get your eyes off
[1:21:57] Jesus if you do that God will let you
[1:22:01] see the
[1:22:02] humanity of a man and it will cause you
[1:22:05] to spin so my best advice to you has
[1:22:09] always been keep your eyes on Jesus and
[1:22:13] off of other
[1:22:15] people he'll never fail you people will
[1:22:19] always they will they will they don't
[1:22:22] mean to they won't intend to but but in
[1:22:24] relationships we will fail one another
[1:22:27] but he will never fail us and let me say
[1:22:31] my absolute is that word of God when I
[1:22:34] hear something under the inspiration I
[1:22:37] have to take that and find it I've got
[1:22:40] to find a place to lock that into the
[1:22:43] Bible and then it all becomes the
[1:22:45] absolute it's all the absolute then when
[1:22:48] it locks into that word dob Tales he
[1:22:52] said like going to the Chinese laundry
[1:22:55] it all fits in then the whole thing all
[1:22:58] of that becomes the absolute nothing can
[1:23:01] stand alone apart from the word of God
[1:23:05] no Pastor no Prophet no book no tape no
[1:23:08] recording come on not even our
[1:23:12] heroes nothing can stand alone it must
[1:23:15] stand uh firm on that word of God and he
[1:23:19] is the one who taught me
[1:23:21] that really it's the truth he is so this
[1:23:25] is under the law and it is the offering
[1:23:28] of the red heer now you know there's
[1:23:30] been a lot about that lately a lot about
[1:23:33] that uh they have built a practice altar
[1:23:36] that's all it was I know that you've
[1:23:38] read all kinds of different things but
[1:23:41] it was a practice Altar and I've already
[1:23:43] been sent from Israel three videos of of
[1:23:48] of a crowd watching the the the
[1:23:51] priesthood practicing learn learning how
[1:23:55] to to go up and down the ramp and how to
[1:23:59] conduct themselves now there was a lot
[1:24:01] of talk that there would be a a a red
[1:24:05] heer offering tomorrow evening as
[1:24:08] Passover begins in Israel it is possible
[1:24:12] but highly unlikely and there are
[1:24:15] reasons for that there is no
[1:24:20] Temple and there is this thought that
[1:24:25] the the new ashes of the red heer would
[1:24:29] have to be mixed with some of the ashes
[1:24:33] of the last red heer and so that leaves
[1:24:37] a big gap and not sure how that will be
[1:24:41] handled and no one among those learned
[1:24:44] men is ready as far as we know to
[1:24:47] publicly declare how that will be
[1:24:50] handled in the absence of having they
[1:24:53] they believe believe that there that
[1:24:56] these ashes have perhaps been preserved
[1:24:59] and that they are probably hidden away
[1:25:02] some people have uh uh felt like even
[1:25:05] archaeologists have felt like that it
[1:25:07] was would be in the area of Jeremiah's
[1:25:10] cave and uh that they would find the
[1:25:13] ashes there in an earn vessel there are
[1:25:15] all kinds of things and you and I as New
[1:25:18] Testament Believers we can't get so
[1:25:20] caught up in that that it becomes a
[1:25:23] conspiracy theory we have
[1:25:27] Christ oh we have the one who came to
[1:25:29] fulfill it all let me tell you the red
[1:25:32] heer his name is Lord Jesus
[1:25:35] Christ and he's bore it
[1:25:37] all but it's interesting to us as
[1:25:40] Believers because the prophet tells us
[1:25:42] that the temple will be rebuilt he tells
[1:25:45] us that it's right in the message of the
[1:25:48] hour and we don't know if it is a third
[1:25:52] Temple that he seems to be referring to
[1:25:54] or if in fact it's the millennial Temple
[1:25:57] that he's referring to but we do believe
[1:25:59] I believe that it certainly will take
[1:26:01] place it is exciting though that they
[1:26:05] have as I showed you pictures quite a
[1:26:07] while ago uh of some real specimens and
[1:26:11] I'm pleased to report that they have
[1:26:13] remained
[1:26:15] pure this is the most unique thing it's
[1:26:17] not the first time that they have found
[1:26:20] uh a pure red heers a family of pure red
[1:26:24] heers we're not going to stay there long
[1:26:25] so don't worry but normally after a
[1:26:29] period of
[1:26:31] time uh it's like the first gray hair on
[1:26:34] a man's
[1:26:36] beard I don't advise you to pull it out
[1:26:39] but I advise you to get ready because
[1:26:42] it's just the first
[1:26:44] fruits of what is to come I see sisters
[1:26:48] sometime got a hold of one and they're
[1:26:50] put don't you know they
[1:26:52] multiply you earn them you ought to be
[1:26:55] thankful for them don't turn them all
[1:26:57] kinds of colors let it let it be a
[1:27:00] testimony that God has kept
[1:27:03] you he's kept you and he's going to keep
[1:27:05] us all the way these red heers this
[1:27:08] family it did in fact come from the
[1:27:11] United States and they have been in
[1:27:13] Israel now for some time and so far not
[1:27:16] one white hair has has grown into place
[1:27:20] so they are still available if needed
[1:27:24] the temple Institute remember brother
[1:27:27] bisc had the temple Institute in and you
[1:27:30] all became familiar through videos and
[1:27:32] streaming some years ago uh about what
[1:27:36] was going on in the temple Institute the
[1:27:38] rabbi came to to the church at brother
[1:27:41] biscos and gave a testimony of what they
[1:27:43] were doing and recreating all of the
[1:27:45] different implements and so forth so
[1:27:48] what has been in the media is a practice
[1:27:51] altar it's exciting to us because it
[1:27:55] tells us that what we're feeling this
[1:27:59] this this strange I hear sister green
[1:28:01] you know I'm sorry but I hear things in
[1:28:04] songs and I hear sister green singing
[1:28:07] her song uh and there's a strange
[1:28:10] excitement in the air Hallelujah and we
[1:28:13] feel it as Believers that we are we're
[1:28:16] on the precipice of of something we
[1:28:20] we've got the message and it's life to
[1:28:22] us but it's me it's really getting
[1:28:25] manifesting time and we're going to be
[1:28:29] tested on that and we're going to have
[1:28:31] to come forth with the proof that we
[1:28:34] have been with
[1:28:35] Jesus stay with me and so I think it's
[1:28:40] exciting that even the Jews are sensing
[1:28:44] an excitement in the middle of
[1:28:47] war in the middle of of rockets coming
[1:28:50] for the first time in history directly
[1:28:54] from Iran and yet there is an excitement
[1:28:58] that they are closer to the coming of
[1:29:00] the Messiah than they have ever been
[1:29:03] before that excites me in
[1:29:07] 1979 when I was in Israel for the first
[1:29:09] time there were little Chambers I
[1:29:12] noticed the last time I was there
[1:29:14] they're they're kind of sealed now
[1:29:16] because there was an earthquake that
[1:29:18] took place one one time my mother and I
[1:29:21] landed in Israel for a trip at and a
[1:29:25] snowstorm uh followed an earthquake an
[1:29:27] earthquake came and a snowstorm freak
[1:29:30] snowstorm came that afternoon or the
[1:29:33] next day the earthquake caused some of
[1:29:36] that original ramp that leads up to the
[1:29:38] Temple Mount to to crumble down and
[1:29:41] because of that they sealed remember it
[1:29:45] exposed an ancient gate it exposed the
[1:29:49] ancient mcrai gate and what was
[1:29:51] interesting to us is we were getting
[1:29:53] ready for camp meeting or maybe just had
[1:29:56] had camp meeting and the theme was was
[1:29:59] uh going in I don't remember the right
[1:30:02] wording anybody going into new doors
[1:30:06] through through ancient Gates through
[1:30:09] ancient Gates into new doors kind of was
[1:30:11] along the line of the song We were
[1:30:13] singing today and so in 79 when I was
[1:30:17] there there were Chambers on the women's
[1:30:20] side and and uh Stone windows with with
[1:30:24] just a little protection bar to keep
[1:30:26] birds from going in and there were women
[1:30:29] there who were dressed in sackcloth and
[1:30:34] who were wailing back and forth and you
[1:30:37] you had to be in just the right place on
[1:30:39] the menide to see it but it was quite a
[1:30:42] sight these women on their their heads
[1:30:46] covered and they're bowing down and
[1:30:48] they're rocking back and forth and
[1:30:51] they're wailing a a moan for
[1:30:54] sorrowful sound and I remember this
[1:30:57] 11-year-old boy saying to the guide are
[1:31:00] they grieving the loss of a loved one
[1:31:02] and he smiled and he said oh no they are
[1:31:06] mourning and weeping and wailing and
[1:31:09] calling for their Messiah to
[1:31:12] come now if in
[1:31:15] 1979 there were already people who were
[1:31:18] wailing and mourning and begging and
[1:31:21] seriously among the Jewish people people
[1:31:24] Desiring that the Messiah would come
[1:31:26] there must be even more desperation
[1:31:29] coming now so this is an exciting time
[1:31:33] because that last Gentile is about to
[1:31:35] come in we know that and then the
[1:31:38] mercies of God returns to his Covenant
[1:31:42] with Israel now that's why we care
[1:31:45] that's why we even mention any of it
[1:31:47] that's why we even talk about Passover
[1:31:49] or any other of God's holy Feast we do
[1:31:53] it because it points us to the
[1:31:55] Fulfillment of all of those things his
[1:31:57] name is the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our
[1:32:01] Messiah we need to know what we stand on
[1:32:04] we need to know what the foundation is
[1:32:06] for what we believe are you with me so
[1:32:09] they're looking under the direction of
[1:32:12] the Lord to to find a red heer that is
[1:32:16] without spot without a white hair
[1:32:19] wherein there is no blemish and and this
[1:32:22] is a kicker and upon which never came
[1:32:25] yoke so this has got to be a young
[1:32:28] enough uh red heer that it has never
[1:32:32] been in servitude it has never been
[1:32:36] directed by
[1:32:40] man we might say
[1:32:42] virgin we might say pure we might say
[1:32:47] unadulterated one that has never been
[1:32:50] under the control of a master never had
[1:32:53] that that heavy burden laid on his
[1:32:55] shoulder and told which direction to go
[1:32:59] and so when the sacrifice was to be made
[1:33:02] it had to be made with a specimen that
[1:33:04] had never had a yoke upon its shoulder
[1:33:07] and ye shall give her unto Eleazar the
[1:33:10] priest that he may bring her forth
[1:33:13] without the
[1:33:15] camp now where does Hebrews tell us that
[1:33:19] Jesus suffered and
[1:33:21] died without the camp
[1:33:24] there is the reason why he couldn't die
[1:33:28] in the city he had to die on the outside
[1:33:32] of the city and many people believe that
[1:33:36] it was on in fact the Mount of Olives
[1:33:40] and a ramp and they have found the
[1:33:42] remnants of that ramp was built from the
[1:33:44] Temple Mount all the way across the
[1:33:46] valley uh to the to the top of the Mount
[1:33:50] of Olives they believe that is where the
[1:33:53] the burnt
[1:33:54] uh offering of the red heer took place
[1:33:57] and that it was directly parallel with
[1:34:02] the holy of
[1:34:04] holies now why is the holy of holies
[1:34:06] significant because that's where the
[1:34:08] blood was
[1:34:09] applied and uh how often how often one
[1:34:14] time a year by the high priest who could
[1:34:16] go in behind the veil only the high
[1:34:19] priest but on this day it's very like ly
[1:34:24] here Jesus is dying parallel to the holy
[1:34:29] of holies and when brother brandom is
[1:34:31] preaching this he said why they could
[1:34:33] look out the
[1:34:35] window anybody remember him saying it
[1:34:38] they could look out the window and see
[1:34:40] him hanging there on the cross and yet
[1:34:43] refused his sacrifice are you with me
[1:34:47] and he said they got out
[1:34:49] what needle and thread and what did they
[1:34:53] start to do
[1:34:55] to sew up the veil to mend the veil now
[1:34:59] that gets me a little hot around the
[1:35:00] collar you see I had to loosen my tie
[1:35:03] when you think about religious
[1:35:06] men here God makes a way he opens up the
[1:35:10] door and
[1:35:16] preachers sea
[1:35:25] pardon me religious men get in the
[1:35:30] way the prophet of the Old Testament
[1:35:33] predicted he prophesied there'll come a
[1:35:35] day they won't go
[1:35:38] in and they won't let others go in
[1:35:42] they'll stand in the
[1:35:44] way there's a motivation in some places
[1:35:47] for keeping people away from the genuine
[1:35:49] baptism of the Holy
[1:35:52] Ghost there is is a a a a an intention
[1:35:56] and an ambition sometime that lies
[1:36:00] behind uh someone trying to keep
[1:36:02] somebody from experiencing the reality
[1:36:05] of a personal baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:08] because when they have that new
[1:36:10] birth it opens their
[1:36:13] eyes to a lot of things and the spirit
[1:36:17] begins to
[1:36:18] move and Mama's in the prayer closet and
[1:36:21] Daddy's in the on the porch in prayer
[1:36:23] and people begin to move and get excited
[1:36:25] and God begins to talk and he begins to
[1:36:28] reveal and sometimes he even exposes
[1:36:31] sin so we must not stand in the way and
[1:36:36] we must not adopt Creeds and dogmas in
[1:36:40] our day that will
[1:36:42] legislate uh men and women from having a
[1:36:46] real Liberty and freedom to yield to
[1:36:50] what was promised to us in in the Bible
[1:36:53] right they shall lay hands on the sick
[1:36:57] and they shall recover they shall speak
[1:37:01] with new tongues as the spirit gives
[1:37:03] utterance we know that's how it comes
[1:37:06] that and if they if they drink any
[1:37:08] deadly thing any deadly poison it won't
[1:37:11] harm them that sounds like a New
[1:37:13] Testament Church before the Holy Ghost
[1:37:15] was poured out God was already building
[1:37:17] in embryonics the church that he was
[1:37:20] going to inaugurate on the day of
[1:37:22] Pentecost aren't you glad he's got it
[1:37:24] all figured out ahead of time and so
[1:37:27] we're thankful we don't ever want to be
[1:37:30] a people that discourage somebody from
[1:37:33] encountering Jesus for themselves you
[1:37:36] must be born again you've got to have
[1:37:39] that Holy Ghost experience give it her
[1:37:42] unto Eleazar the priest that he may
[1:37:44] bring her forth without the camp and one
[1:37:46] shall slay her before his face and
[1:37:49] Eleazar the priest shall take of her
[1:37:51] blood with his finger and sprinkle of of
[1:37:53] her blood directly before the Tabernacle
[1:37:56] of the
[1:37:57] congregation there's the seven again all
[1:38:00] through the book completion God's Divine
[1:38:05] Perfection through the book over and
[1:38:08] over again it's Jesus to us it's Jesus
[1:38:12] who stood in the midst of the seven
[1:38:14] golden lampstands it was Jesus who is
[1:38:17] the Lamb that had seven eyes it was
[1:38:20] Jesus come on it's there it's speaking
[1:38:22] to us even in the Book of Numbers now
[1:38:26] Brother brandham Talks to us I hope you
[1:38:28] won't mind me taking a few minutes here
[1:38:30] Brother brandom Talks to us about yolks
[1:38:33] that the enemy likes to put on our neck
[1:38:35] and and and in the in in the in the
[1:38:38] infamous Church age book uh brother
[1:38:40] brandham or someone said the Yoke of
[1:38:46] hierarchy he likes to put that yoke of
[1:38:50] hierarchy on people now if you don't
[1:38:53] know what that means it's the same thing
[1:38:55] as a nician spirit it's causing
[1:38:59] everybody to to find someone else to
[1:39:01] look up to and and this is the only one
[1:39:05] my pastor is the only one that can get
[1:39:08] in touch with God I hope that's not
[1:39:11] correct I I hope there are many pastors
[1:39:15] and many men of God and this this
[1:39:18] priesthood of the Roman system has
[1:39:21] somehow filtered its way down even into
[1:39:24] protestantism and there is such a
[1:39:26] hierarchy of things and they call it
[1:39:29] putting things in order but sometimes
[1:39:32] it's been L more like
[1:39:38] murder we don't want to murder we want
[1:39:41] to let the Holy Ghost have his way we
[1:39:43] want some order but we don't want
[1:39:46] anybody looking to
[1:39:49] men we get help from Men of God we get
[1:39:52] leader ship for men of God but there's a
[1:39:55] time that you need more than a
[1:39:58] text or a phone call with your preacher
[1:40:01] you've got to be able to get a hold of
[1:40:02] God for yourself so this denominational
[1:40:05] church say they they Bishops they you
[1:40:08] know General prors they're overseers
[1:40:11] they like to put committees in place uh
[1:40:14] uh they like to have all this so
[1:40:16] everybody knows their place and
[1:40:17] everybody's connected you know that can
[1:40:19] really be a yoke of hierarchy on on the
[1:40:23] little the bride of Christ we don't want
[1:40:25] that we don't want to carry that we want
[1:40:26] to break free of that in 1957 brother
[1:40:30] brandham is preaching on on the book of
[1:40:32] Corinthians and he says we don't want
[1:40:35] that yoke of pharaoh to be on our neck
[1:40:39] no yolks I want somebody to declare with
[1:40:42] me no yolks no y I'm not wearing the
[1:40:45] devil's Yol I'm not wearing Pharaoh's
[1:40:48] Yol I'm not wearing yolks of hierarchy
[1:40:51] or yolks of depression or yolks of
[1:40:53] jealousy or yolks of anything else that
[1:40:55] would hinder or prostrate me in such a
[1:40:58] way that I can't arise and
[1:41:01] shine but what do we do with a scripture
[1:41:04] like this in types and
[1:41:07] symbols when in order for a sacrifice to
[1:41:11] be made a specimen had to be found in
[1:41:14] which a yoke had never been laid on his
[1:41:17] should her shoulder excuse me if I say
[1:41:19] his a heer is most definitely a him I
[1:41:22] mean a her
[1:41:26] oh I don't know if that was just age or
[1:41:28] or prazone I'm not sure which it was but
[1:41:31] anyway I've got it right now her on her
[1:41:34] how do you do that in in a in a in a
[1:41:36] type when you start looking at us who
[1:41:39] have this promise that the Yoke will be
[1:41:42] destroyed because of the anointing how
[1:41:45] do we apply that when we look at other
[1:41:48] prophecies in Isaiah that we've been
[1:41:50] reading about the captive Daughter of
[1:41:52] Zion and we're told that the the prophet
[1:41:55] of the Lord says to her get
[1:41:58] up arise shake off the dust loose
[1:42:06] thyself not an
[1:42:09] evangelist
[1:42:11] loose
[1:42:14] thyself if we Are Spiritual Israel and
[1:42:18] here we've been studying in Isaiah that
[1:42:21] a little bride was all down broken
[1:42:24] blooded laying in her in her shame
[1:42:28] refusing to change her her circumstances
[1:42:31] are setting the Yoke that was around her
[1:42:35] shoulder was not even locked the answer
[1:42:38] had already come to set her free but
[1:42:41] she's still wallowing
[1:42:43] there in in her in her hurt and her her
[1:42:46] pain of what she's been through and the
[1:42:49] prophet comes along under the word of
[1:42:51] the Lord he said get up from there Rise
[1:42:53] Up Shake
[1:42:55] thyself shake off the dust loose the
[1:43:00] bands and so if we look at that and we
[1:43:03] look at who we are as spiritual Israel
[1:43:06] is there anyone in this room who can say
[1:43:09] with with with total
[1:43:11] honesty that you have never been under
[1:43:15] the influence or control of something in
[1:43:17] your
[1:43:20] life never been moved by
[1:43:24] jealousy never been been been controlled
[1:43:27] by
[1:43:29] religion never been manipulated by
[1:43:37] Family never had a habit that was
[1:43:39] hindering you more than it was helping
[1:43:41] you I don't think there's
[1:43:44] anybody I I received the baptism of the
[1:43:47] Holy Ghost at 7 years old I've given him
[1:43:49] my whole life but I can assure you that
[1:43:53] any chance any opportunity that Satan
[1:43:56] has had to to come in and and oh so uh
[1:44:02] slithery seductive and slimy and he he
[1:44:07] has taken full advantage to slip a yoke
[1:44:10] on my shoulder many many many times so
[1:44:14] what hope do I have for the anointing to
[1:44:16] sent me free and what hope do I have to
[1:44:19] really be identified with Christ if I
[1:44:23] have already yielded myself to the
[1:44:25] influence of of a spirit or to another
[1:44:28] man how can I ever be purified how can I
[1:44:32] ever be changed by the anointing how
[1:44:36] many of you know there's an
[1:44:38] answer let me ask you this question how
[1:44:41] many of you have gone through several
[1:44:44] versions of
[1:44:47] church to get to where you are
[1:44:50] today various names over the door yeah
[1:44:54] names of blasphemy
[1:44:56] usually because to declare to the
[1:44:59] community that God lives
[1:45:01] here and then bring people into a dead
[1:45:05] religion is a
[1:45:08] lie come on so don't call it Tabernacle
[1:45:12] of Jesus
[1:45:13] Christ if Jesus hadn't been there in 40
[1:45:20] years Church of God is there has he been
[1:45:23] there lately is he showing up Assembly
[1:45:26] of God uh whatever name you put on it
[1:45:31] let let it be a true reflection of
[1:45:33] what's going on on the inside it really
[1:45:35] should be otherwise it becomes names of
[1:45:38] blasphemy how many of you how many of
[1:45:40] you been in one other church let me ask
[1:45:43] you this question especially to you
[1:45:45] locals how many of you this is only
[1:45:47] church you've been a part of let me see
[1:45:48] your hand that would have to be some of
[1:45:50] you few of you only church you've ever
[1:45:52] really been a part of God bless you how
[1:45:54] many of you came from from another one
[1:45:56] other version of church let me see your
[1:45:59] hand and how many of you came by uh
[1:46:02] maybe through two two versions three
[1:46:05] versions four
[1:46:07] versions five versions six versions a
[1:46:10] dozen
[1:46:13] versions oh what a
[1:46:16] journey you my friend have worn many
[1:46:19] yolks on your shoulder how can you ever
[1:46:22] ever be completely free how could you
[1:46:25] ever be a a a Living Sacrifice to the
[1:46:28] Lord having been through so many uh
[1:46:31] touched by man do you understand right
[1:46:34] no longer virgin no longer pure because
[1:46:37] in in each version we go through man
[1:46:40] leaves his impression on us come on and
[1:46:44] and we keep journeying on and this isn't
[1:46:46] against preachers or churches or
[1:46:48] denominate we're not we're not singling
[1:46:50] anybody out but we've all been touched
[1:46:54] come on how many of you were ever
[1:46:56] baptized in
[1:46:58] titles
[1:47:02] wow how many of you were sprinkled
[1:47:04] somebody
[1:47:05] said
[1:47:09] sprinkled I get stirred that stirs me
[1:47:13] up uh but you know like coming from the
[1:47:17] Amish they're poured some of that those
[1:47:21] are poured they're not sprinkled they
[1:47:23] get water poured on them that didn't
[1:47:25] were you baptized sister Martha was it
[1:47:27] poured on your
[1:47:29] head well I've been told that's better
[1:47:31] than
[1:47:34] sprinkling it's another step on the
[1:47:37] journey Hallelujah but you're not dead
[1:47:40] till you've been
[1:47:42] buried I immersion is biblical baptism
[1:47:46] and and you don't baptize babies anybody
[1:47:49] ought to know better than to than to do
[1:47:51] something like that
[1:47:53] we we're but we were in that and that's
[1:47:55] what we and people get so excited and
[1:47:57] they buy Christening
[1:48:00] gowns and and I don't know if you've
[1:48:03] seen any of those reals or not but boy
[1:48:05] some of those uh uh Russian Orthodox and
[1:48:09] some of those groups they get violent in
[1:48:11] their in their
[1:48:16] sprinklings they just sometimes take
[1:48:18] some of them actually will kind of
[1:48:20] immerse them in a little font kind of Di
[1:48:22] them down in a font you seen any of that
[1:48:24] and there and once is not
[1:48:28] enough so they dunk them several times
[1:48:31] all of it man's
[1:48:33] interpretations I once preached in a
[1:48:35] church where people were told you have
[1:48:37] to go down under the water three
[1:48:40] times one for the father one for the son
[1:48:43] one for the Holy Ghost and so what did
[1:48:46] Sincere people do they stood in
[1:48:48] line to be baptized three times in the
[1:48:52] name of titles ignoring acts
[1:48:55] 238 Church can mess with you
[1:48:59] honey but you were God's even in
[1:49:04] that he already oh he already had you in
[1:49:08] his mind he was already drawing you to
[1:49:13] him some of us came straight some of us
[1:49:16] came straight from Pentecost to the
[1:49:19] message some had to go through all kinds
[1:49:21] of different ways to get to where they
[1:49:23] are today but you bless God in all of it
[1:49:26] don't let bitterness ever grip your
[1:49:29] heart for your
[1:49:32] journey you were there because you had
[1:49:34] to be
[1:49:35] there you had to be there many people I
[1:49:39] know could have never come right out of
[1:49:41] sin into into the full truth they had to
[1:49:45] be sprinkled a little here and sprinkled
[1:49:47] a little there and sprinkle so how is it
[1:49:50] that any of us can be really pure
[1:49:52] virgins
[1:49:53] because he's coming
[1:49:55] back just like Moses gave the
[1:49:59] instruction this red heer has to be
[1:50:01] without blemish and never wearing a Yol
[1:50:04] the Bible said he's coming back for a
[1:50:05] church without spot without wrinkle
[1:50:09] without blemish a pure Church a virgin
[1:50:13] Church an unadulterated Church how could
[1:50:17] any of us

[1:50:58] times you've got the right hand of
[1:51:00] Fellowship let me tell you they don't
[1:51:02] only have a right hand of Fellowship
[1:51:03] they've got a right boot of
[1:51:06] Fellowship some of you have got them
[1:51:09] both they welcomed you in and they
[1:51:12] kicked you out don't
[1:51:15] worry but how are we ever going to stand
[1:51:18] before him pure unadulterated virgin
[1:51:23] which means
[1:51:25] untouched never
[1:51:27] knowing the a
[1:51:29] man never knowing how are we ever going
[1:51:32] to get there don't you
[1:51:34] worry don't you worry even those of you
[1:51:36] who if you were to go over there to some
[1:51:38] church your name is you know name
[1:51:44] 1,9 on a roll a roster and that's why in
[1:51:48] churches like that they'll say the
[1:51:49] membership is 5,000
[1:51:53] there's 5,000 on the roll and you look
[1:51:56] at the board or the bulletin or whatever
[1:51:57] on a Wednesday night and there's
[1:52:02] 50 because some of these people hadn't
[1:52:04] been to church your name is being
[1:52:06] counted some of you that didn't get it
[1:52:08] off in churches that you haven't been in
[1:52:10] in 20 and 30 years there's not even
[1:52:13] enough to have a Sunday night service a
[1:52:15] Wednesday night service but you're on
[1:52:16] the roll over there and they're still
[1:52:18] bragging about a thousand people or more
[1:52:19] come on that's the way the church
[1:52:21] packing pews and
[1:52:23] it has become a circus folks and you
[1:52:24] know it come on how are we ever going to
[1:52:28] be that bride that he's looking for I
[1:52:31] want you to know he's handled
[1:52:33] it he's handled it let me share with you
[1:52:37] a quotation from from God's provided
[1:52:39] approach to Divine Fellowship what a
[1:52:42] title are you still with me I know I'm a
[1:52:46] little slower sitting we want to think
[1:52:49] now on the 19th Chapter of of numbers
[1:52:54] God this is paragraph
[1:52:56] 13 God told Moses and Aaron go take a
[1:53:01] red
[1:53:03] heer now the symbol of red many times is
[1:53:08] a bad color or danger but red can also
[1:53:13] mean
[1:53:14] atonement you believe that go get a red
[1:53:17] heer all red not a spot on her she
[1:53:22] represent ented this is Brother brandham
[1:53:23] preaching she represented of course
[1:53:27] Christ just look in another document
[1:53:29] honey and see if you can find it and
[1:53:32] this heer must never have a yoke upon
[1:53:37] its
[1:53:37] neck if it was ever yolked it's
[1:53:42] condemned it must not be yolked up with
[1:53:47] the
[1:53:48] world has anybody ever been yolked up
[1:53:50] with the world here
[1:53:53] he said that's the way the church is
[1:53:55] today
[1:53:57] Christ when he came he never yolked
[1:54:01] himself with the world he stayed with
[1:54:05] God and he was not yolked up with the
[1:54:11] world the church that worships God
[1:54:17] today it's not yolked by the world it's
[1:54:21] yolked
[1:54:23] with
[1:54:24] Christ read those three words
[1:54:27] after look what the blood
[1:54:31] does look what the blood does he said
[1:54:34] then we find that this heer had to be
[1:54:37] killed in the evening time in the
[1:54:38] presence of all of the church Eleazar
[1:54:41] was to catch her blood upon his fingers
[1:54:43] and walk toward the doors of the
[1:54:45] Tabernacle and sprinkle the blood seven
[1:54:47] times or otherwise put seven Stripes
[1:54:49] over the door of the congregation then
[1:54:52] the heer was to be burnt hoofs horns
[1:54:55] hide flesh and all and in this burning
[1:54:58] of the hepher it was to then be mixed
[1:55:00] with hup he said I I believe the better
[1:55:03] word for it pronounced this way hup
[1:55:05] scarlet and Cedar Wood there was a
[1:55:10] process a there was Waters of separation
[1:55:13] and there was a process that was
[1:55:16] necessary but but once that that blood
[1:55:20] once that red heer had spilled that red
[1:55:25] blood it made
[1:55:27] atonement under that law it made
[1:55:31] atonement for The Sinner and for the
[1:55:33] worshipper do you follow that in a
[1:55:36] message God's provided way to provoke uh
[1:55:39] to uh fellowship and it's uh it's in
[1:55:43] another another
[1:55:44] city he said bring me a red heer upon
[1:55:48] which was never a Yol not yolked up with
[1:55:50] anything else bring her and let her be
[1:55:53] brought before Eleazar the high priest
[1:55:55] in the congregation and let them kill
[1:55:57] her and let Eleazar take the blood upon
[1:56:00] the fingers and sprinkle Stripes over
[1:56:02] the door of the congregation seven times
[1:56:04] then said let them burn her body with
[1:56:06] her hoofs and her horns and all that she
[1:56:07] is and then take scarlet and hisop and
[1:56:09] Cedarwood and throw it into the
[1:56:11] sacrifice and burn this together my what
[1:56:14] a recipe and then they was to mix it
[1:56:16] with water and put it in a clean place
[1:56:19] and it was to be Waters of Separation to
[1:56:21] sep separate The Sinner the Christian
[1:56:24] from her sins his sins to bring him
[1:56:29] into oh
[1:56:32] hallelujah how many of you are glad for
[1:56:34] the Waters of
[1:56:36] Separation it is separated you from your
[1:56:39] sin it has divorced you from your
[1:56:43] past it has healed you and restored you
[1:56:46] so that you stand before him pure today
[1:56:49] even though you wore a Yol on your
[1:56:51] shoulder even though you bent low
[1:56:53] beneath the burden of man's religion
[1:56:55] somewhere along the way even though sin
[1:56:57] was weighing you down and addiction was
[1:57:00] weighing you down thanks be to God Amen
[1:57:04] The Living Sacrifice the Lamb of God
[1:57:08] came to fulfill everything necessary to
[1:57:12] separate you from your past you are not
[1:57:16] that old man you used to be we know this
[1:57:19] we know this but sometimes we have to be
[1:57:22] reminded don't we now what happened if a
[1:57:24] Sojourner or a stranger of either a
[1:57:27] children of Israel had sinned and done
[1:57:29] wrong they came to the outer courts
[1:57:32] first and I want you to notice the
[1:57:35] mixing of the sacrifice beautifully now
[1:57:37] the first there was put in Cedar that's
[1:57:39] Cedar Wood scarlet and isip those three
[1:57:42] elements they're used in the Bible many
[1:57:44] times to speak uh it speaks of a
[1:57:47] covenant now you you take a three
[1:57:50] cornered piece of glass and shine it to
[1:57:52] a light a sun it'll produce seven
[1:57:54] different colors a rainbow color a prism
[1:57:57] right if you put the three uh and
[1:58:00] against the sun it'll reflect the
[1:58:01] rainbow and a rainbow stands for a
[1:58:04] covenant so he's typing every little
[1:58:06] piece of this out now I studied this
[1:58:08] sometime ago on what does scarlet mean
[1:58:10] in the bible Scarlet was Ram's wool that
[1:58:14] had been dyed in
[1:58:18] blood knowing that something died to
[1:58:21] color the animal anim a different
[1:58:24] color something had to die to change the
[1:58:27] color of the
[1:58:30] Beast how many of you know something had
[1:58:32] to die to cover Adam and Eve in the
[1:58:36] garden something had to die to cover you
[1:58:39] and I he said the ram was a gray color
[1:58:41] Grizzle which is a hypocrite color it's
[1:58:45] neither black or white oh my the Modern
[1:58:49] Trend of painting everything gray and
[1:58:52] here brother random says it's a a
[1:58:53] hypocrite color but once died in the red
[1:58:56] anybody here knows anything about
[1:58:57] science knows that you can take anything
[1:58:59] red and look at it through
[1:59:05] red and it looks
[1:59:08] white therefore when your sins be as red
[1:59:12] as Crimson they're black
[1:59:13] first then you pour that red blood on
[1:59:16] them and God looks at them through the
[1:59:18] blood of his son you become WI
[1:59:22] never a yoke never a yoke never a yoke
[1:59:26] has been on your shoulder Untouched by
[1:59:29] men come on that's what the blood can do
[1:59:32] that's what justification does that's
[1:59:34] what full Redemption does red through
[1:59:38] red looks
[1:59:40] white red looking at
[1:59:43] Red turns
[1:59:46] white God looking at the sinner that's
[1:59:49] confessed he is a sinner and has
[1:59:51] accepted God's provided way of approach
[1:59:53] God sees him why a snow a heer where
[1:59:57] there's never been a Yol a lamb where
[1:59:59] there's never been a blemish come
[2:00:01] on look at all the typology we go all
[2:00:04] the way through the scripture God sees
[2:00:06] him white as snow there you're looking
[2:00:08] red through red he can't look through a
[2:00:14] Creed you may be in good standing with
[2:00:17] your church but how is your relationship
[2:00:20] with him on he cannot look through a
[2:00:23] denomination he cannot look through
[2:00:26] something else it must be the
[2:00:30] blood and what else blood alone and the
[2:00:34] blood alone he said oh how I remember
[2:00:38] the old Salvation Army song oh
[2:00:42] precious is that flow say it with me
[2:00:46] that makes me white as snow no other f i
[2:00:52] know nothing but the blood of
[2:00:58] Jesus you who were sexually impure
[2:01:03] BC before
[2:01:05] Christ when you receive a virgin
[2:01:09] word when you receive the unadulterated
[2:01:12] pure blood of Jesus Christ he sets you
[2:01:16] free from that Mark against your life
[2:01:22] now I just looked it up uh to see and
[2:01:25] the question was asked on a science
[2:01:27] Forum why do we see a white object when
[2:01:30] we're looking at a red object through
[2:01:32] red
[2:01:33] glass and here's the answer it might
[2:01:35] mean something to some of you
[2:01:37] nerds he said now let's say your red
[2:01:40] filter is perfect it only allows red
[2:01:43] light and blocks everything else so
[2:01:46] anything that's actually red will send
[2:01:49] light to your eyes and anything that
[2:01:53] isn't actually red won't so red will
[2:01:56] appear white and everything else will
[2:01:59] look black I don't know that that means
[2:02:01] any more to me than than it did before I
[2:02:03] read it but now you've got a scientific
[2:02:07] explanation for what brother brandham
[2:02:09] knew him a long long time ago he'd
[2:02:11] already come across the information and
[2:02:13] he said if you're looking at a red item
[2:02:14] through a red piece of glass it's not
[2:02:16] going to look
[2:02:17] red it's a little fascinating isn't it
[2:02:20] it's going to look white so we are being
[2:02:23] justified and we are being restored and
[2:02:26] we are being made
[2:02:29] virgin it's too
[2:02:33] quiet did did you know the blood can do
[2:02:36] that did you know the blood can do that
[2:02:39] Birmingham let me give them Birmingham
[2:02:41] scriptural signs we're
[2:02:44] moving but remember the bride will be
[2:02:47] called out separated and different
[2:02:49] filled Holy Ghost born
[2:02:52] washed in the blood she'll abstain from
[2:02:56] everything that's filthy around her
[2:02:59] husband she is a chased virgin pure how
[2:03:05] by the
[2:03:06] word even you were
[2:03:08] sprinkled even you that wore titles even
[2:03:12] you that were
[2:03:14] immoral
[2:03:16] hello even you that had more lovers than
[2:03:19] you can
[2:03:20] count that precious word that precious
[2:03:24] blood has not only covered your
[2:03:27] sin but it has atoned and it has
[2:03:32] Justified and it has redeemed us back to
[2:03:36] the original thoughts that God had about
[2:03:38] us in the beginning Hallelujah so even
[2:03:41] though there have been many times in our
[2:03:43] life that a yoke was laid on our
[2:03:45] shoulder and we were temporarily driven
[2:03:54] many of us had a pig pin
[2:03:57] experience he found us in the pig pin
[2:04:00] like you found the prodigal there he
[2:04:03] came to himself how many of you are glad
[2:04:05] for the day that you came to yourself
[2:04:08] yeah preacher I remember but I've been
[2:04:09] way back again since then I I've gone
[2:04:12] back into all kinds of things since then
[2:04:14] I want you to know this the same
[2:04:18] blood the same blood that took your yolk
[2:04:21] off the first time right the same blood
[2:04:24] cries out on your
[2:04:28] behalf right so don't trouble me after
[2:04:31] the service by telling me you don't know
[2:04:34] what I've done I don't need to
[2:04:37] know sometimes I don't even want to know
[2:04:42] the one who knows the most about you
[2:04:46] loves you the most and all he said is
[2:04:49] claim my
[2:04:50] blood make my word make up your mind to
[2:04:55] arise out of the depression and the
[2:04:57] prostration that your circumstances have
[2:05:00] kept you in arise and shine for the
[2:05:03] glory of the Lord has risen upon
[2:05:07] thee God still has an appointment in
[2:05:11] your
[2:05:13] life he doesn't see it
[2:05:17] no he doesn't see it he chooses to see
[2:05:22] you through the
[2:05:26] blood does he know it sure he
[2:05:29] knows but it's not what he's looking
[2:05:32] at you know we're not
[2:05:36] completely free from
[2:05:38] something until we can look at the
[2:05:42] offender and not feel the
[2:05:46] offense I want to tell you something I'm
[2:05:48] not quite there in some few few few few
[2:05:51] circumstances
[2:05:54] I have
[2:05:55] forgiven and I have moved
[2:05:57] on but I can't tell you that sometimes
[2:06:01] when I see someone that I don't
[2:06:05] remember I have to make and you do too
[2:06:07] in that situation we have to make a
[2:06:09] conscious
[2:06:11] decision the blood the blood the blood
[2:06:14] the blood the blood the blood the blood
[2:06:16] the blood the
[2:06:17] blood when he looks when we look we see
[2:06:21] from memory as well as the moment but
[2:06:24] when he
[2:06:26] looks she is a chased virgin pure by the
[2:06:29] word it's just 1:00
[2:06:31] folks the word in her the word in her
[2:06:35] the word in her the blood in
[2:06:39] her oh yes are the
[2:06:44] same as a man and his wife become one in
[2:06:48] Union so does the real genuine Church of
[2:06:51] God
[2:06:52] God when he becomes in Christ the Bible
[2:06:56] is punctuated with an amen every promise
[2:06:59] don't make any difference what the
[2:07:01] denomination says the soul that's in The
[2:07:03] Believer punctuates it because it is the
[2:07:06] word in
[2:07:11] him what about those who were
[2:07:14] molested both naturally and
[2:07:17] spiritually what about those who carry
[2:07:20] the scars of of religious
[2:07:24] molestation of church
[2:07:26] abuse what about those touched by men's
[2:07:31] ideas leading them away from the word
[2:07:35] and sometimes doing it
[2:07:37] sincerely because they couldn't see in
[2:07:40] that point in their life the fullness of
[2:07:42] the truth so why hold it against them
[2:07:46] why not just let it
[2:07:48] go even those who have dealt with that
[2:07:51] kind of violation because one of the
[2:07:54] things that happens to you when you come
[2:07:56] out of
[2:07:57] mess is you feel so
[2:08:00] violated why didn't you tell me that God
[2:08:03] is
[2:08:05] one why were you trying to give me more
[2:08:08] than one person when the Bible tells us
[2:08:10] he's
[2:08:11] one three offices three demonstrations
[2:08:14] and more but one
[2:08:17] God why did you tell why didn't you tell
[2:08:19] me that that clean living
[2:08:22] matters and why didn't you tell and you
[2:08:24] go through all of that you got to let
[2:08:26] that go you've got to let that go let me
[2:08:29] tell you something once you put the Yoke
[2:08:31] of his love his blood his word once you
[2:08:34] wear that let me tell you what Jesus
[2:08:36] said in Matthew 11:28-30 come unto
[2:08:45] me I've had so many people through the
[2:08:47] years say I feel like a
[2:08:49] fool for all the stuff I
[2:08:52] swallowed I feel like a fool for every
[2:08:54] lie that I believed in church or or a
[2:08:58] young woman I believed every lie that
[2:08:59] boy was telling me I believed he loved
[2:09:03] me come on I really believed I was going
[2:09:06] to be the one but he took me and he used
[2:09:09] me and he left me I believe what he had
[2:09:13] to say and many times people get that
[2:09:16] they carry that and it it becomes a
[2:09:18] burden to them I want you to know Jesus
[2:09:21] takes care of that he said come unto me
[2:09:23] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[2:09:26] and I will give you rest brother that's
[2:09:29] more than eight hours of sleep it's a
[2:09:33] peace it it's a bubble of peace that
[2:09:36] passes all
[2:09:39] understanding and and you say oh my by
[2:09:43] the grace of God he brought me through
[2:09:45] all that today I'm a new creature today
[2:09:49] I'm I'm not wearing the Yoke of hierarch
[2:09:51] today I'm not wearing Pharaoh's y Yol
[2:09:54] today I'm not wearing the Yol of
[2:09:57] denominationalism today I'm not wearing
[2:09:59] the Yoke of addiction and if you are
[2:10:02] he's offering you
[2:10:05] his and his yoke not only replaces the
[2:10:10] old yoke but the old yoke is destroyed
[2:10:14] because of the anointing because of the
[2:10:17] impact of the
[2:10:19] logos because of what the pillar of fire
[2:10:22] accomplishes in the life of the believer
[2:10:24] the old yoke is destroyed and you are
[2:10:27] made pure by his
[2:10:30] yoke his yoke takes away the stain of
[2:10:35] the
[2:10:35] molestation the stain of being joined to
[2:10:39] something other than Christ thinking
[2:10:41] that you're doing God a
[2:10:45] service this
[2:10:48] yoke take my yoke take my yoke upon
[2:10:55] you this is the one who fulfilled the
[2:10:57] sacrifice of the red heer this is one
[2:11:00] who came brother brandham says and I
[2:11:03] don't know if we we'll get to it but he
[2:11:04] says he had to come by a virgin birth
[2:11:08] because he was a building a virgin
[2:11:09] church he was building a virgin bride he
[2:11:11] couldn't come by a sex
[2:11:15] act he said Jesus couldn't have come by
[2:11:17] a SE sex sex act it had to be divine
[2:11:22] because he was building a Divine people
[2:11:24] he was calling out a Divine seed a holy
[2:11:28] people an undefiled people and yet we
[2:11:31] all know as we admitted a few moments
[2:11:33] ago we all know we've been defiled we
[2:11:35] all know we've been touched we all know
[2:11:37] we've been B burdened down and we have
[2:11:39] gone through I don't want to sound uh
[2:11:42] disrespectful but through hell and high
[2:11:44] water come on you you can handle a
[2:11:46] little of that can't you cuz that's
[2:11:48] where you've been and if I turned you
[2:11:50] loose you might say where worse than
[2:11:51] that so let me help
[2:11:54] you but thanks be to God you come
[2:11:57] through I come through I came through I
[2:12:00] came through I came through I came
[2:12:03] through I
[2:12:04] overcame now tomorrow night when the sun
[2:12:07] is going down it begins on the on our
[2:12:10] calendar the the Feast of of of
[2:12:13] unleavened
[2:12:14] bread and tomorrow night specifically is
[2:12:17] the night of the Passover so tomorrow
[2:12:20] all day is called a Passover and the
[2:12:23] Seder would traditionally be had
[2:12:25] tomorrow night the first night of of the
[2:12:28] week of UNL bread it doesn't matter when
[2:12:31] you do it matters that you take this
[2:12:34] opportunity to
[2:12:36] remember that the death angel once came
[2:12:39] very close to your
[2:12:42] house anybody listening to me I know I'm
[2:12:45] long- winded I've been told by by by all
[2:12:49] my life I've been told that so I I'm not
[2:12:51] offended when you say it unless Zach
[2:12:54] makes a joke or something it might hurt
[2:12:56] my feelings a little little sensitive
[2:12:59] sometimes most of the time I can handle
[2:13:01] it and always tell him I got lots to
[2:13:05] say come on you don't have to say am man
[2:13:08] you didn't have to like what I say but
[2:13:10] you could have said amen you have lost
[2:13:12] to say I don't always like it but you
[2:13:14] got lost to
[2:13:18] say he told me when he called me you
[2:13:20] open your mouth
[2:13:22] mouth I'll feel
[2:13:24] it I haven't ever closed my mouth he
[2:13:27] hasn't ever stopped feeling it I hope he
[2:13:30] uses me
[2:13:32] more I hope I can be used more for the
[2:13:35] kingdom I I realize uh you know even
[2:13:38] when you feel sorry for yourself if you
[2:13:40] let God talk to you you realize I got
[2:13:42] more to
[2:13:43] give I got something else to do for the
[2:13:46] king Hallelujah so I need not wallow
[2:13:49] around in the in the of of of my failure
[2:13:52] or my mistake or my slackness or what I
[2:13:54] didn't do people say I've just I've just
[2:13:57] wasted so much time don't you know who
[2:13:58] you serve you serve a redeemer of time
[2:14:01] oh my God all your wasted time he can
[2:14:06] redeem
[2:14:07] that when you take his yoke on
[2:14:11] you he actually takes you back to a
[2:14:15] place untouched pure
[2:14:19] undefiled when the hardest things for my
[2:14:22] mother to understand when she came to
[2:14:24] the Lord was how it could really be
[2:14:27] so how could a God who remembers
[2:14:30] everything who knows everything
[2:14:32] omniscient all knowledge How could a god
[2:14:35] like that forget my
[2:14:40] sin because he chooses to see you
[2:14:43] through the filter of the blood that he
[2:14:45] created to redeem you oh he knew you
[2:14:49] before you were born he knew you
[2:14:51] before you were even in your mother's
[2:14:52] womb he knew you and he knew then that
[2:14:55] you'd have some many steps along the way
[2:14:58] come on many uprisings and some down
[2:15:00] fallings come on I don't think anybody
[2:15:03] truly
[2:15:05] appreciates where they are in Christ
[2:15:08] unless they've had a few slack places
[2:15:10] along the way I'm not encouraging you to
[2:15:14] backslide but I think sometime when you
[2:15:17] reach for him and realize you've let him
[2:15:19] go
[2:15:21] right you wish not that the spirit of
[2:15:23] the Lord had departed I think that is
[2:15:26] the moment that you cry out to him in
[2:15:27] desperation and most of the time what do
[2:15:29] you
[2:15:30] find he keeps he comes
[2:15:34] rushing now don't you don't you
[2:15:36] disregard that wooing of the holy spirit
[2:15:39] because every time you reject him every
[2:15:41] time you turn him down every time you
[2:15:43] pass up his offer to pull you back into
[2:15:46] his side it gets harder and harder and
[2:15:49] harder and harder to find your way come
[2:15:50] on
[2:15:52] because you look at Christ like some of
[2:15:54] you have looked at your church history
[2:15:56] and let me tell you something he's none
[2:15:58] of that he's not a father like your
[2:16:02] father you may have had the most
[2:16:04] outstanding father but none like him you
[2:16:07] might not have had much of a father in
[2:16:09] your life but it's so common for people
[2:16:11] to look at God as they look at their
[2:16:13] Earthly father you've got to be free
[2:16:15] from that or you'll never you'll never
[2:16:18] understand that that he's your ABA that
[2:16:20] he's your Papa he is not out to get you
[2:16:23] he is out to get
[2:16:25] you he's not out to push you away he's
[2:16:28] out to draw you in he wants you to wear
[2:16:30] a
[2:16:31] yoke just not the Yoke of the world the
[2:16:34] Yoke of sin the Yoke of pharaoh the Yoke
[2:16:36] of hierarchy the Yoke of depression or
[2:16:38] addiction he wants you to wear his put
[2:16:41] that back up honey take my yoke upon
[2:16:46] you my yoke is a teaching yoke
[2:16:52] my yoke reveals something to you learn
[2:16:56] of
[2:16:58] me when you were hooked up to religion
[2:17:02] you were learning of religion when you
[2:17:04] were hooked up to some system you were
[2:17:06] learning the the edicts of the system
[2:17:09] but when you get hooked up to
[2:17:11] Christ when you wear his Yol he reveals
[2:17:15] to you brother not just on
[2:17:17] Sunday oh if you're one of them I don't
[2:17:20] know how you ever ever survive what's
[2:17:23] coming you can't feed on Sunday and no
[2:17:26] more you can't feed on Tuesday night and
[2:17:29] no more you've got to have an IV you've
[2:17:31] got to have an infusion you've got to be
[2:17:33] plugged into Christ you've got to draw
[2:17:37] him into your home every day with
[2:17:39] worship you got to have him riding in
[2:17:42] the automobile with you singing his
[2:17:48] Praises some of you need the cross on
[2:17:51] your rearview
[2:17:55] mirror because you take the Second
[2:17:59] Glance the enemy will appetize and
[2:18:05] sensationalize
[2:18:07] tantalize come
[2:18:09] on the BAM said I like to hang that
[2:18:11] there because when I come across some of
[2:18:13] that other stuff then I turn my
[2:18:16] head if a prophet had to do such a thing
[2:18:19] do you think you're so holy that you
[2:18:22] don't have to turn your eyes away from a
[2:18:24] half-dressed woman or and you don't you
[2:18:27] don't have to go to I mean maybe 25
[2:18:30] years ago you had to go to a strip joint
[2:18:32] I guess to see something like that now
[2:18:34] just
[2:18:40] Walmart or
[2:18:45] church I don't like
[2:18:48] waterburger but I found myself in water
[2:18:53] Burger there was a young girl who came
[2:18:58] in and it broke my
[2:19:00] heart late it was after the
[2:19:04] concert because of the time difference I
[2:19:07] guess it wasn't quite as late for them
[2:19:08] as it was for us and she came in and her
[2:19:11] little outfit was underwear for people
[2:19:14] to wear the
[2:19:16] bed and here she comes walking through
[2:19:19] there just a young girl for 14 15 years
[2:19:21] old old biker group sitting over there
[2:19:24] at tables and your and and your heart
[2:19:27] there's no condemnation I don't want to
[2:19:29] condemn
[2:19:31] her I want to cover her up I'd like to
[2:19:34] give her my Overcoat I'd like to tell
[2:19:36] her that she's more valuable than a
[2:19:38] piece of
[2:19:40] meat I'd like to tell her if you could
[2:19:43] see how much Jesus loves you you
[2:19:45] wouldn't need the Google of some Old
[2:19:48] redneck hoodlum
[2:19:52] glaring at you like a hungry dog in a
[2:19:55] back of a pen somewhere you wouldn't
[2:19:57] need that for your affirmation you
[2:19:59] wouldn't need that for your approval And
[2:20:01] yet when we walk in somewhere we draw
[2:20:03] more
[2:20:05] attention more people turn their head to
[2:20:07] see us then they do that unless it's a
[2:20:09] man Googling at a woman like that breaks
[2:20:12] my heart because it's an
[2:20:15] advertisement no wonder there's a armed
[2:20:18] guard standing at the front of Waterberg
[2:20:24] in Montgomery I said to her do you have
[2:20:26] to be here all night she said no sir not
[2:20:28] all night just a
[2:20:30] 230 then the shift changes Whoever
[2:20:33] thought in a in in in a in your mind so
[2:20:36] many years ago you'd need a guard
[2:20:37] standing at the door of a burger
[2:20:39] place but that's the the the insanity of
[2:20:43] the
[2:20:44] world why would you choose to be a part
[2:20:47] of that when you can have everything you
[2:20:50] need sufficiently supplied for you in
[2:20:54] Christ he will give you your
[2:20:58] value once you take his yoke on you
[2:21:01] start learning who he is and who you are
[2:21:05] because you're in him and it satisfies
[2:21:09] the need for
[2:21:12] validation if you're not finding
[2:21:14] validation in Christ you need more of
[2:21:16] him that's right and that's not a
[2:21:19] condemnation that's an invitation come
[2:21:22] get more of him come get more of him so
[2:21:25] that he's what you love who you love
[2:21:27] above all
[2:21:30] else there's nothing no thing no one
[2:21:34] that means as much to you as your daily
[2:21:36] communion and your daily relationship
[2:21:39] with Jesus Christ we've got to get that
[2:21:41] way anybody helping
[2:21:44] me where am I at finishing that for I am
[2:21:47] meek and
[2:21:49] lowly in heart and you shall find rest
[2:21:53] unto your souls now that soul is your
[2:21:57] mind anybody ever need rest in your
[2:22:00] mind your
[2:22:02] will your will have you ever needed your
[2:22:05] will to behave silly
[2:22:10] boy we've all been there that will that
[2:22:14] that that that human will
[2:22:18] says it's so it's so much us it's so
[2:22:23] much of what we deal with that old will
[2:22:25] gets in
[2:22:29] there a
[2:22:31] Dollar 50 Cent $10 whatever standing in
[2:22:35] your way of doing what God wants you to
[2:22:39] do learn of me for I am meek and lowly
[2:22:42] in heart and you shall find rest for
[2:22:44] your mind your will and oh my
[2:22:50] there's another part of the
[2:22:55] Soul your
[2:23:02] emotions anybody ever have emotional
[2:23:09] issues don't worry we're not going to
[2:23:11] get the straight jacket
[2:23:14] out I'm very
[2:23:17] careful I I used to think that mental
[2:23:20] disease es or was a for you know just a
[2:23:23] certain group of
[2:23:25] people I have come to find out we can
[2:23:28] all have a little
[2:23:31] disease in our in our mental emotions
[2:23:34] come on we can get sidetracked in a
[2:23:37] hurry have you ever gone from zero to
[2:23:41] 50 everything feeling pretty good pretty
[2:23:44] calm and all of a sudden your heart
[2:23:45] racing your mouth dry your seconds
[2:23:50] that's a power of what an emotion can do
[2:23:52] and yet we we pray for you but we can't
[2:23:54] cast out your emotions because we can't
[2:23:57] cast out your soul it's a part of your
[2:23:59] tripartate
[2:24:01] man and remember if you follow follow
[2:24:05] this outline like I do in the scripture
[2:24:07] he gives us the order then you
[2:24:09] understand that your spirit is trying to
[2:24:11] feed it's trying to feed on Christ it's
[2:24:14] trying to feed on the world and your
[2:24:16] mind and your will and your emotion is
[2:24:18] trying to get between you and that word
[2:24:21] so that you can't feed who you really
[2:24:23] are and that's when you get the analogy
[2:24:26] of the stickman and the sumo wrestler
[2:24:29] because whatever part of your tripartate
[2:24:31] man you feed the most is going to be the
[2:24:35] biggest and that's why some of us are
[2:24:37] like a little toothpick in our spiritual
[2:24:40] man because the soul gets so caught up
[2:24:43] in its will and it's and its mind and
[2:24:47] and its emotions and we get so washed
[2:24:49] away in that and we become
[2:24:52] yolked by
[2:24:56] Temper fly off the handle I'm still
[2:25:00] preaching there's a half a dozen or more
[2:25:04] listening it's because we need rest we
[2:25:08] need rest and if you think I'm talking
[2:25:11] about a vacation I'm
[2:25:14] not because a vacation serves other
[2:25:17] purposes
[2:25:21] you don't usually get sleep on one
[2:25:23] though do
[2:25:24] you you run
[2:25:27] ragged you got to see it all and do it
[2:25:30] all and take it all in and you got to
[2:25:31] eat everywhere oh I got how got to stay
[2:25:33] another night cuz I got to eat there we
[2:25:36] get that way that's how we are and come
[2:25:38] home sometime exhausted Ben you're tired
[2:25:41] this
[2:25:43] morning keep waking him up there Kendra
[2:25:46] no I'm
[2:25:48] kidding it's not a vacation
[2:25:51] it's not a change of
[2:25:54] scenery people tell me through the years
[2:25:56] I need a little break from church no you
[2:25:59] don't need a break from
[2:26:02] church you need a break from
[2:26:05] you and you can't get out of you the
[2:26:08] only place that you can learn how is to
[2:26:12] get in his
[2:26:13] presence so that you can have some rest
[2:26:16] I mean rest I mean rest
[2:26:20] you see Sabbath is a whole lot more than
[2:26:22] 24 hours on a clock somewhere it's so
[2:26:26] much more it always
[2:26:28] was it was always pointing to someone
[2:26:31] yes sir not to
[2:26:36] something Jesus didn't think it was
[2:26:39] wrong to pluck kernels and feed his
[2:26:41] disciples on the
[2:26:43] Sabbath he didn't think it was wrong to
[2:26:46] pull the ox out of the
[2:26:49] ditch it's more than a
[2:26:52] day it's it's a place of living and when
[2:26:55] you are yolked into Christ you can find
[2:26:58] Sabbath more than Friday night to
[2:26:59] Saturday nighto if that's the only time
[2:27:02] we had peace in our life and rest in our
[2:27:04] life we'd be in trouble wouldn't we how
[2:27:06] many of you are glad you know the master
[2:27:08] of
[2:27:09] Sab you know him he is our peace he is
[2:27:14] our rest ye shall find rest for your
[2:27:16] souls Jesus said for my yoke next verse
[2:27:21] for my yoke is easy I guarantee you
[2:27:25] churchianity yoke isn't easy I guarantee
[2:27:28] you addiction yoke is not
[2:27:30] easy I guarantee you the yolks that
[2:27:33] we've wore through our life of pharaoh
[2:27:35] and all this stuff all all this stuff is
[2:27:38] heavy but Jesus said you take my Yol and
[2:27:41] you start learning of me I start
[2:27:43] revealing myself through you to you in
[2:27:47] you you take my yoke it's easy it's not
[2:27:49] a heavy burden it's not weighted down
[2:27:52] that's why God's people don't have to
[2:27:53] come to church like they're
[2:27:57] miserable that's why they don't have to
[2:27:59] drag in and sling their diaper bag on
[2:28:01] the
[2:28:05] seat comes sit
[2:28:08] down because life is
[2:28:10] hard and you ought have thought about
[2:28:13] how hard children can be when you
[2:28:14] started having them it's going to
[2:28:17] complicate everything I'm going to tell
[2:28:18] you right now everything in your life is
[2:28:20] going to be Complicated by children but
[2:28:22] they're worth the
[2:28:26] effort they're worth the effort it's a
[2:28:29] Ministry a Godly mother is a Ministry
[2:28:33] not only to her children but to her
[2:28:35] church and to her
[2:28:37] community she's doing the world around
[2:28:39] her a favor by pouring into her children
[2:28:43] it's a privilege and I know how hard it
[2:28:45] is sometime to get all the noses wiped
[2:28:48] and to get everything in place before
[2:28:49] you get to the house of God but you
[2:28:51] still don't have to come in and throw
[2:28:52] your diaper bag down and want everybody
[2:28:54] to know you're you're here I've arrive
[2:28:56] oh I
[2:28:58] lock because his yoke is easy and you
[2:29:01] see it as another opportunity to be in
[2:29:03] his presence we got to have his presence
[2:29:06] with us more than when we get here but
[2:29:08] you know what I mean coming together
[2:29:09] under a corporate anointing is so
[2:29:11] valuable and so precious well I don't
[2:29:13] get to hear what the preacher says you
[2:29:15] don't understand there are times you
[2:29:17] need to and there are time it's recorded
[2:29:19] for you and you can hear it again but
[2:29:21] there are times you just need to be here
[2:29:23] in his presence in the house angels are
[2:29:26] here the word is here the anointing is
[2:29:31] here you find
[2:29:35] rest some of you find spiritual rest and
[2:29:38] a
[2:29:40] nap you'll get a lot of
[2:29:45] rest paragraph 82 of the message Shalom
[2:29:47] and I'm going to close shortly yeah yeah
[2:29:50] you say that well I better not look here
[2:29:52] I'm getting more amens here than I
[2:29:55] am there than I am here he said that's
[2:29:59] the reason Jesus is coming for a chased
[2:30:01] virgin pure filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:30:04] and not of the world but of the power of
[2:30:07] God the paragraph before this I don't
[2:30:09] have it for you but he's talking about
[2:30:11] why Jesus had to come by a virgin he
[2:30:14] said that's the reason Jesus is coming
[2:30:15] and and look at that old church world
[2:30:17] out there trying now to say that it
[2:30:19] didn't mean vir
[2:30:21] meant just a young Maiden look at those
[2:30:23] Bible translations some of them nearly
[2:30:25] inspired some of them not inspired at
[2:30:28] all making you think that it was just a
[2:30:30] young average girl there who who was had
[2:30:33] has nothing to do with her Purity oh yes
[2:30:35] it did that's the reason Jesus is coming
[2:30:38] for a chased virgin pure filled with the
[2:30:41] Holy Ghost and there are times there are
[2:30:44] many times that we don't feel like any
[2:30:46] of
[2:30:47] that we feel used abused beat up knocked
[2:30:51] around nobody appreciates us on our job
[2:30:54] nobody appreciates us at home life is
[2:30:58] tough how are we ever going to be this
[2:31:00] we already are this this is who we are
[2:31:05] this is our true identity we have
[2:31:07] changed
[2:31:09] yolks the old yoke is destroyed the old
[2:31:12] man is gone he said that's the reason
[2:31:13] Jesus is coming for a Chase virgin pure
[2:31:16] filled with the Holy Ghost and not of
[2:31:17] the world but of the power of God how
[2:31:19] wonderful to know that there is a
[2:31:21] possibility to get into this
[2:31:24] group how do you do it you'll never do
[2:31:27] it by joining in two
[2:31:31] organization let's read on oh that's all
[2:31:33] of that one is no a little more you will
[2:31:36] do it when you are baptized by the Holy
[2:31:40] Spirit into the mystical body of Jesus
[2:31:43] Christ raised with him in Resurrection
[2:31:47] free from death and sin and then he said
[2:31:51] so it's not confessing to the
[2:31:54] preacher or the priest it's not lighting
[2:31:57] the
[2:31:59] candle it's not saying the Hail
[2:32:03] Mary it's not just by paying of your
[2:32:07] tithe not just by Church attendance it's
[2:32:10] not just by Modest dressing and living
[2:32:13] there's only one way that's the bloody
[2:32:16] way that's the bloody way in the
[2:32:20] revelation of Jesus Christ he simply
[2:32:21] said that's like the Virgin the word
[2:32:23] virgin means pure holy unadulterated
[2:32:25] Sanctified let me tell you something the
[2:32:27] M up people that some of us have been in
[2:32:29] our life we could never be any of this
[2:32:31] outside the
[2:32:33] blood oh my the blood should never be
[2:32:36] common to us when we sing a song about
[2:32:39] the blood that we've sung for 40 years
[2:32:41] it ought to mean as much to us today as
[2:32:43] it did the first time we ever sung it
[2:32:45] because it is our Redemption plan now
[2:32:48] I'm often reminded brother random said
[2:32:50] we're not saved by the blood we're saved
[2:32:51] by grace but it's very very important to
[2:32:55] see how that fits in the scripture and
[2:32:57] how that fits in the scripture is the
[2:32:59] Bible said you're saved not of Works
[2:33:01] you're saved by grace salvation is of
[2:33:03] Grace it's the grace of God that brought
[2:33:06] the blood to your house the blood is the
[2:33:09] token price of your Redemption you could
[2:33:11] not have been redeemed without the blood
[2:33:13] to say you could be saved without the
[2:33:15] blood is wrong because there had to be a
[2:33:18] token price
[2:33:20] but the grace the grace that he was
[2:33:23] preaching about was the transportation
[2:33:25] that brought the blood to you my God
[2:33:28] thank you by Grace I'm saved the grace
[2:33:30] brought me to the blood the grace
[2:33:32] brought the blood to me that's the
[2:33:34] Virgin the word means pure holy
[2:33:36] unadulterated Sanctified one more and
[2:33:37] we're
[2:33:38] closed things that are to be 62 but the
[2:33:42] other one is called my father's house
[2:33:44] I'll go and prepare a place for you take
[2:33:46] you out of this pest house and deliver
[2:33:48] you into my father's house
[2:33:50] house amen there you are take you out of
[2:33:53] this old Earthly pest house how many of
[2:33:55] you are looking for that change one
[2:33:57] day it kind of It kind of struck me good
[2:34:01] the old songs we were singing this
[2:34:03] morning I knew some of you thought what
[2:34:05] in the
[2:34:06] world everyone's old everyone's
[2:34:13] old I remember how happy I was when I
[2:34:16] heard that rising up song being sung in
[2:34:18] youth camps and youth meetings around
[2:34:19] the
[2:34:20] message thrill me has a little life to
[2:34:23] it might not have been written in the
[2:34:27] 50s but it has a little life in it we
[2:34:30] need that sometime All Good gospel songs
[2:34:33] don't have to be written a generation
[2:34:35] ago there's people in this bride that
[2:34:38] have inspiration to write beautiful
[2:34:41] music and there are other people out
[2:34:43] there in systems because you start
[2:34:45] examining the religious background of
[2:34:47] some of the old great hymns and you will
[2:34:50] quickly come to the understanding that
[2:34:52] most of them were
[2:34:54] trinitarians most of them baptized in
[2:34:56] titles and yet they found inspiration to
[2:34:58] write the songs that we sing and praise
[2:35:00] God about today so the holy spirit will
[2:35:02] lead you to what's for you and what's
[2:35:03] not for you but I resent people having
[2:35:06] an attitude that it has to be in the
[2:35:08] only beli book before we can use it in
[2:35:10] church that's a
[2:35:11] Creed it's a Creed
[2:35:14] hello it's a dogma and I'm not going to
[2:35:17] carry that Creed or that Dogma but it
[2:35:19] sure felt good today and I'll tell you
[2:35:20] why it reminded me of my childhood not
[2:35:23] because of the words of the song only
[2:35:25] but because of the look of the
[2:35:28] people when I was a boy in the
[2:35:30] Pentecostal church it was
[2:35:33] tough the people that went to to to my
[2:35:36] granny's church the church I grew up in
[2:35:38] were poor
[2:35:40] people there was not a new car in the
[2:35:42] parking
[2:35:43] lot there wasn't a 2-year-old car in the
[2:35:46] parking lot unless my granny had it and
[2:35:49] and that wasn't because of the church
[2:35:51] that was because of her income tax
[2:35:52] income she was a preparer for income
[2:35:56] tax people worked in the cotton
[2:35:59] meals and the hosery meals and the denim
[2:36:02] meals of Columbus Mogi County and they
[2:36:04] work split shift
[2:36:07] work sometimes second sometimes third
[2:36:10] sometimes first and second they were
[2:36:12] wore
[2:36:14] out most everybody in the church I grew
[2:36:16] up in had bags under their eyes
[2:36:25] very few
[2:36:27] suits among
[2:36:29] them
[2:36:31] mostly freshly pressed denim
[2:36:36] jeans cuffed by the
[2:36:38] way was country people they' moved to
[2:36:42] the city to find a better life and had
[2:36:44] raised their children to find a better
[2:36:45] life and they maybe a little better than
[2:36:47] the farm but it wasn't too Swift
[2:36:52] there was one nephew of my grandmother
[2:36:54] who who was in the church and he had a
[2:36:56] little bit of money he made $10 an hour
[2:36:58] and that was big money in the in the
[2:37:02] 70s but he had a lot of
[2:37:05] children when those people would come to
[2:37:07] church and and the singing would start
[2:37:10] they would they would look so tired when
[2:37:11] they come in especially on a Tuesday
[2:37:14] night you'd think we will we we w't hard
[2:37:18] to get through this service
[2:37:20] they'll be asleep before the first
[2:37:22] hym weary looking but I want you to know
[2:37:27] when they started singing those songs
[2:37:30] here's what it helped them do they got
[2:37:32] their eyes off of their
[2:37:35] circumstances and they got their eyes on
[2:37:37] the promise oh my did they come
[2:37:41] alive did they come alive the music they
[2:37:44] could pump out of that accordion
[2:37:49] talk about heavy-handed piano
[2:37:52] players they didn't think if you if you
[2:37:54] didn't pound the piano they didn't think
[2:37:56] you was a piano
[2:37:57] player there was no no playing no no
[2:38:01] caressing the keys the the harder they
[2:38:04] bang the more anointed they
[2:38:07] felt I don't care how tired and how
[2:38:09] weary they were when they got in that
[2:38:11] atmosphere of singing them old songs I
[2:38:14] wouldn't take nothing for my journey
[2:38:17] now got my hand on the gospel plow and
[2:38:20] I'm Holding
[2:38:23] On Heaven's
[2:38:26] Jubilee every song pointing either to
[2:38:28] the blood or to
[2:38:30] Eternity and if you get your eyes on the
[2:38:32] blood or you get your eyes on eternity I
[2:38:35] tell you you can you can make your way
[2:38:37] through the
[2:38:40] stuff a perfect place he's gone to
[2:38:42] prepare a place where no evil exists no
[2:38:45] sickness exists no old age exist no
[2:38:48] death exist
[2:38:50] it's a perfect place calling you to that
[2:38:53] Perfection and then there's this phrase
[2:38:55] here don't let it upset you and you have
[2:38:59] to be perfect to get there well how many
[2:39:01] of you feel disqualified all of us
[2:39:04] should in the
[2:39:05] natural if we're thinking carnal
[2:39:10] thoughts I know some perfect
[2:39:14] messes but I don't know any perfect
[2:39:16] people in the natural and yet he said
[2:39:19] you you got to be perfect to get there
[2:39:20] the Bible said so and it does Jesus said
[2:39:23] be therefore perfect even as your father
[2:39:25] in Heaven is perfect there has to be a
[2:39:27] way for us there has to be a way for us
[2:39:30] let's go on it's a perfect Kingdom so it
[2:39:34] must be a perfect people come because
[2:39:36] you have to stand and be
[2:39:38] married to a perfect Son of God here it
[2:39:42] is some were married to churches and
[2:39:45] some were married in sin and some were
[2:39:47] married to this and some were married to
[2:39:49] that
[2:39:49] and some married to
[2:39:54] drugs you've got to be married to a
[2:39:56] perfect son the perfect Son of God and
[2:39:59] you must be a perfect bride so how can
[2:40:02] you do it through anything else but the
[2:40:04] perfect word of God every provision we
[2:40:08] need to be everything he's called us to
[2:40:10] be is supplied for us by fellowshipping
[2:40:13] that word because that word is not
[2:40:17] here it's here
[2:40:20] which is the Waters of Separation back
[2:40:23] to the red he that washes us from our
[2:40:25] sins it separates us your sin on one
[2:40:29] side you're on the other side you once
[2:40:31] wore a yoke of those sin now you're
[2:40:33] wearing the Yoke of the
[2:40:35] Lord amen that's right the blood of
[2:40:39] Jesus Christ think of it dripping bloody
[2:40:42] word the word the blood the word of God
[2:40:45] bleeding blood to wash the bre died
[2:40:51] in amen yes sir she stands
[2:40:55] perfect and she hasn't been she stands
[2:40:59] virgin and she hasn't been she stands
[2:41:04] unadulterated and she hasn't been
[2:41:08] why because of the blood and then look
[2:41:11] at that next phrase she never
[2:41:14] sinned in the first place
[2:41:19] is that all you
[2:41:22] got let's have some come
[2:41:26] on you say something that profound and
[2:41:30] you're afraid to say come on because
[2:41:31] you're afraid I
[2:41:34] will I'm done this is done this is me
[2:41:37] nearly done musicians are
[2:41:40] coming she never
[2:41:43] sinned in the first place
[2:41:46] Hallelujah you see all that took place
[2:41:49] place in the realm of
[2:41:51] time and she's
[2:41:54] Eternal what's living inside of you is
[2:41:56] not of time this life of Jesus Christ is
[2:42:00] in you always has been always will be it
[2:42:03] is eternal so your body is existing in
[2:42:06] the realm of time but who you really are
[2:42:09] is drawing from the Eternal if you
[2:42:12] believe that say Amen so no matter what
[2:42:14] it was whether it was yesterday or 45
[2:42:18] years ago what whatever it was if you
[2:42:21] have come under that blood if you have
[2:42:24] let the anointing presence of God
[2:42:26] destroy that old yoke and you are now
[2:42:29] wearing the Yoke of the Lord the Yoke of
[2:42:31] the word the Yoke of the blood he looks
[2:42:34] at you and this is the testimony this is
[2:42:37] what is announced over your life you
[2:42:40] never sinned in the first
[2:42:46] place Hallelujah
[2:42:53] is that too big to
[2:42:55] believe and and listen at this
[2:42:58] strategy she was trapped into
[2:43:06] it Satan laid a trap for
[2:43:10] you because you came here with a
[2:43:16] Target you know that Old Devil he learns
[2:43:18] by OB observation you might learn
[2:43:20] something if you'll be quiet and
[2:43:24] watch he learns by observation and he
[2:43:27] started watching people's life down
[2:43:29] Through the Ages and he must have
[2:43:32] discovered a pattern that follows the
[2:43:35] chosen of the
[2:43:38] Lord and once he discovered that he took
[2:43:41] full advantage of that and therefore by
[2:43:44] the time you came along all these
[2:43:46] Generations later
[2:43:50] he identified you way
[2:43:53] back as being one of his God's the
[2:43:58] father's not not
[2:44:00] his and by that he did everything he
[2:44:03] could to lay trap after trap after trap
[2:44:05] for you in your life because he never
[2:44:07] wanted you to get to the Yoke of the
[2:44:09] Lord he didn't mind you wearing the Yoke
[2:44:12] of of whatever else I don't even really
[2:44:14] like to keep naming it over and over
[2:44:16] again lust or whatever it is he he he
[2:44:20] was happy if he could put that on your
[2:44:22] shoulder but the minute you came under
[2:44:24] the influence of that
[2:44:27] blood and you started fellowshipping
[2:44:29] with the pure word the Virgin word the
[2:44:31] unadulterated word and that anointing
[2:44:34] came to destroy the Yoke in your life
[2:44:37] and to set you free and you said hey
[2:44:38] here's a Yol I don't mind wearing this
[2:44:40] is easy this one talks to me about who
[2:44:43] he is brother there's so much Revelation
[2:44:46] if you'll put the Yoke of the Lord on if
[2:44:49] if you'll turn the idiot box
[2:44:52] off and let the Holy Ghost talk to you
[2:44:54] from the
[2:44:56] book she never sinned in the first place
[2:45:00] she was trapped into it see there's the
[2:45:02] father's house that he has gone to
[2:45:05] prepare is that all of that one how many
[2:45:08] of you have got a place to go
[2:45:10] to you're not going to stumble in there
[2:45:14] you got to have a strategy and your
[2:45:16] strategy has to be surrender

[2:55:34] flows maybe you're here today and you
[2:55:37] still got a yoke on your
[2:55:39] shoulder something's burdened you
[2:55:42] something's weighing you down you can't
[2:55:45] quite get out from under it well I just
[2:55:47] want to say one more time he's got it he
[2:55:52] has a yoke to replace all
[2:55:54] yolks his is not a heaviness on your
[2:55:58] shoulder or in your
[2:55:59] heart his is freedom and lightness and
[2:56:03] wholeness maybe it doesn't come
[2:56:05] instantaneously it's a journey toward
[2:56:08] him there's no doubt about it we're
[2:56:10] being restored back to his side but oh
[2:56:13] I'm telling you something the journey is
[2:56:15] a whole lot sweeter when you recognize
[2:56:18] the one that's walking with you and I
[2:56:20] just wonder right now if you are if
[2:56:22] you're here a saint of God a child of
[2:56:25] God or one who has known the Lord or
[2:56:27] maybe one who's just not fellowshipping
[2:56:29] with him at all but but you know that
[2:56:31] there's some there there's some control
[2:56:33] issues there's some stuff going on
[2:56:35] that's trying to dictate some stuff to
[2:56:38] you control some things in your mind and
[2:56:41] you'd like to have some help from the
[2:56:43] Lord today would you just slip up your
[2:56:45] hand just wherever you are many that's
[2:56:48] that's us it's us why don't we pray
[2:56:52] together why don't we get a hold of God
[2:56:55] together if there are any of the rest of
[2:56:57] you that would want to join us you're so
[2:56:58] welcome to do that it's not necessary
[2:57:01] but you're certainly welcome to come
[2:57:02] this way we're just going to pray
[2:57:04] together we're just going to pray a
[2:57:05] corporate prayer now if you're standing
[2:57:08] by someone and you happen to notice that
[2:57:10] they raise their hand put your hand on a
[2:57:12] shoulder just reach over and touch him
[2:57:14] on the arm brother to brother sister to
[2:57:16] sister uh whatever is appropriate and
[2:57:20] let's ask the Lord to help him get out
[2:57:23] from under that thing and to to wear a
[2:57:26] new
[2:57:27] Yol oh one that's not burdensome and one
[2:57:31] that's easy one that it's
[2:57:35] refreshing the one that keeps us going
[2:57:38] it's the Yoke of the word it's the truth
[2:57:40] of God that's come to set us free let's
[2:57:43] pray right now father in the name of
[2:57:46] Jesus when I look out across this house
[2:57:50] I see the cream of the
[2:57:52] crop I see the best of the best I see
[2:57:56] those that you have saved and redeemed
[2:57:59] and rescued out of the pit it is not
[2:58:03] surprising to me that the enemy would
[2:58:06] like to put a yoke a burden some heavy
[2:58:10] yoke on their
[2:58:12] shoulder join them to something other
[2:58:14] than
[2:58:15] Christ but today by the life of that
[2:58:18] blood we move against that
[2:58:21] now and we decree and declare in the
[2:58:25] name of Jesus that this is a war that
[2:58:28] Satan has already
[2:58:30] lost you may have trapped us into some
[2:58:35] things but those things are not our
[2:58:39] identity we have chosen a new
[2:58:42] Yol one of Purity one of wholeness one
[2:58:47] that is based on the unadulterated word
[2:58:50] of God and because of that word we're
[2:58:54] freed we're freed our minds are
[2:58:59] freed we can have control over our
[2:59:05] emotions we recognize that Satan has
[2:59:08] tried to kill
[2:59:10] us but God's Grace has saved us again
[2:59:15] and again and again and so with every
[2:59:18] breath we want to give you praise Lord
[2:59:22] with every moment we want to we want to
[2:59:24] give you glory and we want to give you
[2:59:27] honor and we want to say it's because of
[2:59:30] you we're not where we are today because
[2:59:33] of our own strength or power we're where
[2:59:35] we are today because of your Mighty
[2:59:37] blood because of the quickening life the
[2:59:40] quickening power of the Holy Ghost
[2:59:55] [Music]
[2:59:56] hallelujah
[2:59:59] hallelujah
[3:00:01] hallelujah hallelujah brother gy would
[3:00:05] you do me a favor would you go back
[3:00:07] there and stand next to Josh a minute I
[3:00:10] don't want to embarrass him he doesn't
[3:00:11] know me and I don't want to embarrass
[3:00:14] him but I I would just like for you if
[3:00:15] he didn't mind for you to just touch him
[3:00:17] on shoulder and let me pray I'm doing
[3:00:20] this because I am convinced I don't know
[3:00:23] a lot of the details of uh his life I
[3:00:26] just know a a mom and a dad that asked
[3:00:28] prayer for him a lot but I know he could
[3:00:30] have he could have been killed just
[3:00:33] recently and I know that it wasn't
[3:00:36] chance or look that has preserved his
[3:00:40] life I know enough about how this thing
[3:00:43] works to know he was kept and preserved
[3:00:48] yes to serve the Lord and I don't want
[3:00:51] to embarrass him in any way and and
[3:00:53] Stephen Beth you can tell him just how I
[3:00:55] am I'm just pling vanilla but I had to
[3:00:58] do that so the rest of us are just
[3:01:01] staying where we are but this prayer is
[3:01:03] for our young
[3:01:05] brother we're thanking God for his life
[3:01:08] being preserved he's had a hard road but
[3:01:12] God has preserved him and kept him for a
[3:01:14] purpose so we are agreeing in prayer
[3:01:17] right now now Lord I don't know the
[3:01:20] destiny that you have for this young man
[3:01:23] but you
[3:01:24] do and that's why you have protected him
[3:01:28] and that's why you have held on to him
[3:01:31] when he couldn't hold on to you and I
[3:01:34] didn't want to miss this opportunity to
[3:01:36] celebrate in his presence the goodness
[3:01:39] of God that I recognize in his life so
