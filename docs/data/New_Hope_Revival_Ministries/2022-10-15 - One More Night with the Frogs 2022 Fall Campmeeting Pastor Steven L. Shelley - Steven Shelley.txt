honor to our brother Eddie Miller this evening a pastor a long time soldier of the cross a real fighter for God and for truth I'm thankful that he was able to be here tonight God bless you brother [Applause] Exodus chapter 8 and verse 1 and the Lord spake unto Moses going to pharaoh and say unto him saith the Lord let go that they may serve me you see God was jealous over his children he wanted them to be free to worship Him so he said you go to pharaoh and tell him thus saith the Lord let my people go that they may serve me and if thou refuse to let them go behold I will Smite all thy borders with frogs the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up and come into thine house and into thy bed chamber and upon thy bed and into the house of thy servants and upon thy people and into thy ovens and into thy needing troughs and the Frog shall come up both on thee and upon thy people and upon all thy servants the Lord spake unto Moses say unto Aaron stretch forth thine hand with thy rod over the streams over the rivers over the ponds and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt and Aaron stretched out his hand over the Waters of Egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt and The Magicians did so with their enchantments and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated this evening we go on to verse 8. then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said entreat the Lord that he may take away the frogs from me from my people I will let the people go that they may do sacrifice unto the Lord Moses said unto Pharaoh Glory over me when shall I entreat for thee for thy servants for thy people to destroy the frogs from thee and the houses that they may remain in the river only that's where I want them to be in the river I I want you to listen at this crazy answer it's a mystery why in the world would he go to all the trouble of calling up the prophets to get some help and then say uh well when would you like to get this help oh let me think about it a little bit all the time croak I know I don't make a good frog sound can anybody help me I can always depend on brother Daniel you do it one do it one more time I I'll just say croak my frogs speak English all right they just say crow all the time Croke Crow car is that Bender yeah that sounds like a goose or something don't it all the time and they're everywhere that they're hopping around him all around him and everywhere he looks the floor is just covered the land is completely covered with frogs and he has an opportunity to do something about it and for some strange reason he said oh let's see uh what about tomorrow it doesn't make a whole lot of sense does it are you with me tonight and Moses said all right we can handle that be it according to Thy Word not one minute earlier not one minute later exactly as you have said it it will be that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the Lord our God he goes on here for just a few more verses that thou mayest know will stop there that thou mayest know that there is none like unto the Lord Our God now we have studied together about the plagues of Egypt and this is not Passover time but we will talk for just a moment about one particular plague and it's important to know that these were not just random things that God was doing there in Egypt every one of those plagues represented a God that was worshiped in Egypt they even worshiped the river and so when the river turned to blood that sturdum that caused them to be alarmed and and the LIE send them your Reign on the cattle and and all the hail and all the different plagues every one of them God was saying there there's a God bigger than your pretend Gods I want to remind you tonight that among the Gods there's one God who is Alive forevermore and I want to remind you that Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of the New Testament that they're not two gods they're certainly not three Gods hear o Israel the Lord thy God is one the Bible said there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the spirit and these three are one so it seems that while the church emphasizes that God is three the word is emphasizing that God is one well you've got a choice will you stick with your church or will you stick with the word I don't know about you but I'm going to take my stand with the word of God he's one one and he's able to do whatever we need him to do tonight Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever he changes not if he ever delivered an addict he's still a deliverer if he ever healed the sick still a Healer so among all of those things those idols those you know Fables that men may call gods there is only one true Living God David expressed it this way in a pagan land he said among the gods there is no God like unto our god he's a he's above them all and I want you to know he's a jealous God he's a particular God and he wants our affection and our attention to be focused on him he's not looking for those who will serve him on Sunday he's looking for those that desire a relationship with him that's 24 hours a day seven days a week and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me that I am his own he's looking for Fellowship he's looking for relationship if you believe that you can give a witness here by saying amen so so we know that that the children of Israel they ended up in this whole mess because of their Rebellion because they wouldn't listen to God the way they needed to listen to God and so they ended up in slavery in Egypt and you know it was hard and if any of you have ever seen the Ten Commandments I CeCe will be the meal you you know it's a it's an amazing depictment of what what it might have looked like what we read in the scripture and I don't know if they've ever made a better depiction of of that story than than the historical film that we have uh the Ten Commandments and I don't know if there's ever been a Moses like Charlton Heston I I said that one time I I have a picture in in my in my uh of Charlton Heston as Moses and he's got his arms stretched out over me while I'm getting ready every day and and my my son saw it one day and he said Dad do you have a man crush on Charlton Heston I said I certainly do not but I think he did the best job at Moses that I've ever seen and when I meet Moses I'm going to tell him God allowed his people to go into this kind of of slavery because he wanted to work some things out of them and I will take the time tonight I I could actually just turn this part over to brother greedy and he could go through I'm telling you I've been so blessed as he went through detail after detail after detail this week giving us the reality of the of the story and the back story and the middle part of the story and the end of the story and and I'd like to do the same tonight but but it would take me way too long because I have some things that I have to say and I want to get them out so I'm just assuming that that you've read it in the Bible or you've watched it on film and you have some understanding that this was a horrible time and God was tired of his people not being able to worship Him He allowed them to go into this place of slavery their own Rebellion made them slaves in Egypt but it was time for a deliverer to come Hallelujah I'm glad that a Moses showed up I'm glad that God had a Moses that he'd been training and preserving for such a time as this you know he could have been crocodile food yeah because the Pharaoh was killing all the firstborn of the males of Israel and you know his mother she had this idea she said oh we got to do something we we can't just let Moses be cured on by precious boy with it wasn't Called Moses then but we can't let him be killed we've got to preserve him and she had this idea we'll make a little basket weave a little basket and we'll pitch it with tar and I'll lay the baby in that basket and I'll set it in that old Nile River and we will depend that the god of Israel will preserve his life if you've never heard brother Branham preach on the story of Moses you should hear him dramatize that story if I had time I'd play you a little portion of it because it really makes it live I want you to see the Nile River and all of the dangers of the Nile River we are told that there were whirlpools in the river that could have easily taken that little basket down to the bottom of the river and drown that little baby but God had a destiny he had a plan for Moses life and he wasn't going to let no Whirlpool take him out of God's plan I want you to know tonight God has a plan he has a destiny he has a purpose for your life and if you're wasting your life now you need to awaken yourself and you need to recognize you weren't born here to be who you think you ought to be you were born here to be who God created you to be which is above and beyond anything that you could ever think about yourself what God has called you for what God has chosen you for what God wants to do through you in this end time is bigger than anything we could imagine you say well I'm just a housewife how could God use me let me tell you something he knows how to use anybody that will yield themselves to him hey man you don't have to be a preacher to be used of God he'll use you wherever you go you just ask sister Flo if God won't use you wherever you go you'll just carry the light with you wherever you go somebody's going to want to know what's going on in your life so no Whirlpool could take Moses out of his Destiny plan and you know when I could go back here we go when his mother looked at him she said this is a goodly child this is a goodly child now now I don't know what that means to you and your understanding but as I have told you before through the years it comes from that Hebrew word tov and Tove t-o-v is sometimes translated good when God was creating the Earth the Bible said Andy and that and the evening in the morning were the first day and God saw that what he had created was it was told it was good so here is a mother who has brought forth a child and the first thing she says when she looks in his eyes is this child is Tove now I think every mother thinks that their baby is good I'm going to let you in on a little secret don't ask me if you don't want me to tell you the truth hahaha sister West who was playing the the keyboard up here her dad was a pastor brother Stuckey and he found an unusual way to handle those uncomfortable situations when the mother wants you to to kiss their their their homely baby and they want oh don't get mad we don't have any ugly children around here your aquatic God I just had to say that didn't I and they'd say oh brother Stuckey I want to show you my my beautiful baby my handsome baby born he said yes I've never seen another one like it that wasn't really saying much was it they don't always come here looking fine sometimes they've got stork bites sometimes they got a cone head yeah you ever seen it Egghead mama don't see it well if she sees it she don't tell it she just says ain't he handsome yeah she beautiful and you just say oh I just never seen another one like it yoga mat said he is a goodly child and that means more than a handsome boy that means more than than my own and I love him because he's mine it actually means that his mother was able to spiritually discern that this boy wasn't just an ordinary boy born in the household of Israel it actually means that with discernment when she looked in his eye she saw this child has a destiny this boy has a purpose and he's going to be a help to the people of God so she did everything within her power God gave her a creative Supernatural idea and she placed it tenderly into the Nile and the whirlpools couldn't get it and brother branham's preaching away and he said that little basket started floating toward one of those whirlpools and an angel came took his finger and pushed that little basket out of the way and it goes floating on down the river he said there lay a crocodile on the bank over there hungry smelt something that smelt like breakfast and he goes over and calls some of his kin and they go over they're fixing to have baby Moses one that would soon be Called Moses when his mother Drew him from the water uh they would just have that little baby for breakfast and brother Branham said no the angel of the Lord came those angels just came in thumped said he just thumped that crocodile right on the nose that crocodile didn't even know what had hit him all he knew was I'm not getting any breakfast from a basket floating down the water you know God has a way of protecting our destiny mm-hmm he has a way of watching over us when we don't even know we're being watched over I want you to know he was sitting with you on that bar stool I want you to know some of you he went with to the crack house with you I want you to know there are people that lay on the abortion table and Jesus was there with him somebody said I can't even imagine such a thing as that you just don't know how jealous over you he is he watched over you he wooed you he followed you he protected you even in sin that's my God somebody said how could he do that because he knew who you were he knew your purpose and your destiny he knew that you were his [Applause] before the foundation of the world the scripture said you have not chosen me you're with me you have not chosen me I have chosen you saith the Lord I told a little brother standing right up there I said you just might as well yield yourself because God's hand is on you and he's going to have you because he will win every time he's that jealous over you I want you to look at your neighbor and say God's jealous over me he's kicked more than one demon in the nose he's dealt with more than one crocodile he's pushed you out of more than one whirlpool to save your life I don't know how many times I've prayed for people through the years and the Lord would let me break through vision and begin to see times in their life where the enemy had come to kill them and all you have to do is just begin to tell just a little bit you don't have to give all the detail you just tell a little bit of that time and when they recognize that that is their life and that God was watching over them and he cared enough to come that night and remind them you see there's only so long in our life that we can have it like Burger King we can have it our way there's only so long that you can have it your way so it's what I tell people you just might as well Kick It Up I'm a crazy sounding preacher but I tell people sometime you might as well just kick it up because there's coming an hour when you're not going to be able to continue to kick against the pricks you see I preach and believe so much in the sovereignty of God that I believe God knows the hour that you're going to surrender your life to him I believe before you're ever born he knows the circumstance he knows the church house he knows the stool in your living room he knows the steering wheel you're going to be sitting behind when you call on the name of Jesus and all of your life up to that moment is him watching over you and wooing you and loving you and calling you and I I shudder when I think about some of the places we've drug him but he was committed committed I've drugging through some Churches where he was a stranger for he didn't recognize anything in that place he he didn't recognize himself in the stained glass windows and he didn't recognize himself in the steeple and he didn't recognize himself in the creeds come on he didn't even know in fact he's just like it's just like the scripture tells us where he's standing outside the door and you know we love this picture where Jesus is standing outside the door knocking Saltair is one of the ones there's several who who did different Renditions of Jesus standing outside the door knocking and we preachers when we're giving off the calls we like to talk about that being the heart's door and there's no doubt in my mind that you've got a door to open or close I believe that there's no doubt in my mind he is not going to override your choice you've got free will but here's the thing God knew your choice before you ever made your choice he already represented represented himself in your life way before you ever chose him if you believe that's amen but that's not the heart's door that John was talking about in The Book of the Revelation it's the door of the church house read it read the context he said behold I stand at the door not if any man can you imagine Jesus standing on the outside of his own church got his name up over the door got his picture in the stained glass and he don't even have a key to get in his own church they've got it locked out come on they've got their crowds they've got their music they've got their entertainment they've got their programs they've got their committee meetings they've got their denominational ideas man-made stuff Jesus can't even get in his own church to really save the lost the only invitation that's given sometime is will you come move your letter I don't even know what a letter is I don't have a letter I don't have anywhere to move my letter from or two there's only one way to join the church that I'm a part of and that ain't got nothing to do with moving the letter don't have anything to do with the right hand of Fellowship you've got to be borned into the Church of Jesus Christ it's a spiritual bird you must be born again that's it the only way you can join the church of the Lord Jesus Christ you're born into it by spiritual experience so somebody said I don't know about all that feeling let me tell you something when Heaven comes down and rocks your world you're going to feel something thank you that tiny little pill can give you a bus what do you think is going to happen when you grab a hold of the King of Kings and the lord of the Lord if a few sips of that liquor is going to make you feel different what do you think is going to happen when Jesus comes and starts living inside of you calling you his own come on now you're going to feel something you're going to have a little life you know I think there's so many people that are in love with their church but they're not really in love with the Lord and you don't need to be that way I don't want you to be in love with your pastor and not be in love with the Lord I don't want you to be in a level what you believe and not be in love with the Lord because Doctrine is a person somebody said how could you say that because Jesus said I am the way I am the truth I am the life so truth is not a church truth is a person come on just like Resurrection is not a Sunday it's not one Sunday out of the year one out of 52. Resurrection is is life and it's what God does for every one of his children and Resurrection is a person because remember what Jesus said he said to to Mary Mother I am come on now I'm surprised that somebody didn't say well where's the bunny are you gonna get quiet now where's the bunny where's the basket Jesus said I am I am the resurrection and the life he's a reality folks you believe that so God Was preparing and protecting and covering Moses as he floated down that River and it was God who guided that little basket into the right spot so that so that the daughter of pharaoh would be down there just the right moment bathing and somebody would see and and if you see in the Ten Commandments it depicts his mother and his sister following along in the Reeds real little clandestine so that nobody will notice and it just so happens that that when they draw that little nursing baby out of the water come on the way it's portrayed in the movie well there's his mother she's already got everything he needs to eat and so it's as though she just turns and says hey I I need someone to help take care of this baby so we don't know if it happened exactly like that but it's a it's an unbelievable thought that God was protecting this little baby boy because one day he was going to rise up and be the deliverer of the children of Israel I want to tell you something your destiny might not be that big it might not be that elaborate it might not be that colorful but it's precious and it's valuable and nobody's going to do for God what he called you to do for God we need to stay in our own lane we need to find what God has called us to do and do it with everything that is within us everybody's not going to feel the pulpit and everybody's not going to sing and everybody's not going to do one thing or another but there's something that God has preserved you for and that is that you might serve him in spirit and in truth now I want to just read you this real quick as we move along in this in a message Christ is the mystery of God revealed brother Branham said something about this that I find to be a very interesting perspective uh the mind of a prophet is an amazing thing how God gave him some insight if you read it there in the text it just sounds like that billions and billions and billions of frogs just happen to be swimming in the river because it says just raise your hand over the river and out of the river came these frogs well the problem with that is there weren't that many frogs in all the now so those frogs had to come from somewhere you and me so in in paragraph 470 he said he can do whatever I want to remind you of this he can do whatever he wants you you're going to tell God how to do his business he can do whatever he wants to he can create how many of you believe God can create well he sure can he can do anything he's God the very same God that creative life you see that's in you you're a prisoner you can't speak it till he says speak it listen but when you spoke it's God's word he's Vindicated it to be so this is the authority that God wants to place in his end time bride an authority to speak the word of God and draw back and watch God preform that word somebody said didn't all that stop with the apostles it absolutely did not he is the same yesterday and today and forever we've already established that and so if God was ever creative he is still creative and if his word was ever creative his word is still creative he's just building a people that he can trust with that kind of authority you know we don't know what we're facing yet in this nation we we've had it easy you know we complain about gas for high gas price let me tell you some folks have real problems I'm not making light but you see it didn't stop most of us we found a way where there's a will there's a way we just kept putting gas we flinched every time we complained every time but by God's miraculous help we always filled it up or if we couldn't fill it up we got enough to get us till we could fill it up again or put some more in it I don't know how you were raised but I was raised on five dollar gas stops I've been with my mama when she had two dollar gas stops of course please remember that two dollars could take you a whole lot farther than than it can take you now I remember talking to my mother one time and and she said to me that she was nearly uh in her late 30s in her late 30s before she ever remembered filling up her gas tank so you know this is not anything new and we get all bent out of shape but folks we're facing some more serious troubles than that this nation's in trouble and there's only one answer it's Jesus there's only one answer and that's you getting enough of him in your life that you can jump on in here and fulfill your destiny because the sooner you do the sooner he comes and gets those that are his if you don't have any other who could get your eye on Eternity for a change and you could say my the quicker I get up and do what God has called me to do the quicker I can go on to be with him you let the devil have what's left here it's all going to burn up anyway Hallelujah but you're not going to miss a beat if you have eternal life anybody with me all right he goes on he's Vindicated everything else is right and he knows when that spoke is not it's got to be so Moses took his rod and said let there come frogs because God said let there come frogs the important thing is to make sure you're saying what God's saying you don't want to be saying something God's not saying in a wrong time or or even the wrong word he just transmitted it on out that's right and look what happened frogs was in everything everywhere was frogs where did they come from nobody knows they wasn't there before but the Creator God working through a Man created things a living species does anybody believe that he said the very God that made the first frog foreign the second frog he makes all for Oma you see what I mean made the first squirrel the second squirrel make any does that remind you of anything where do you want it why do you want the squirrel God not only created squirrels he asked the servant of the Lord where he wanted the squirrel to be created now somebody said well that was a prophet well I want you to know that Prophet was a forerunner of what God wants to do in his end time bride there's going to be sons of God men and women who are sons of God men and women who are the bride of Christ that are going to need some of that authority over the creative because we're going to get in some fixes and we're going to need God's Supernatural help so I'm not going to find myself with a bunch of people that don't believe that God is still able to help us today somebody said well you know he did all those things in the Bible there because that was perilous times and they really needed to get the truth established let me ask you to look around what what does this look like to you we're coming out of a great Falling Away these are perilous times even the church is falling away even the churches locked the king out uh she's she's more busy with with her donut shop and her tattoo parlor and all the other things that churches are doing these days come on come off of her Destiny and and on to how we can make it more friendly let me tell you something I don't want to create such an atmosphere that you get comfortable in your sin I want to create such an atmosphere that when you get in that presence the first thing you want to do is give it all to him that's why we worship the way we know if we can lift him high enough he'll come in here he'll come in here and he'll do the same thing today and he did when he walked the shores of Galilee Are you still with me all right there were frogs everywhere frogs frogs frogs when Pharaoh sent his maids in to bake the biscuits there was frogs in the needing Bowl Mama raises the lid off the double and frogs is in the dough Bowl and frogs are in the buttermilk and frogs are in the cornflake box frogs were everywhere I don't believe there was refrigerators but they had been in there if there had been refrigerators frogs everywhere so frog frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs frogs and when old fat Pharaoh took his robe off and give himself a dip in that pool that tub there to take a bath he had to do it with frogs swimming around and some of us have been in that kind of water we fought the snakes off to swim and we fought the frogs I've I've thrown rocks and alligators to swim we got out on little shift boats on the lake in Africa little little tiny little handmade boats where the hippopotamuses are and the hippopotamuses are scary enough because they like to tip them little boats but them them you know 50 or more crocodiles laying up there on the bank and there will be little black children swimming right underneath those crocodiles I said now that's getting a little brave for me and they said well you don't have to worry about it because there's so many fish in this lake lake Bulgaria while they they just the crocodiles just eat the fish and they don't care nothing about the children and I just told them right front I said they've never seen a supper like me they look at those little skinny chick but I said I'm Mighty concerned that when they see me they may decide they want more than fish for dinner true story right frogs everywhere frogs in the kitchen frogs in the bed chamber frogs in the Outhouse frogs in the living room frogs in the closet indoor and outdoor frogs and on The Lawns frogs and in the gardens frogs there were frogs everywhere and everywhere there were frogs I want you to see it I want you to picture it in your mind everywhere they walked yeah squash I just got sick who did they said Oh Sister Frozen sister Anna there I'm sure are you cold you're probably cold too did that make you a little nauseous what about you go to eat a biscuit you've got a frog leg in it y'all we don't need any extra hamburgers just let me get on this for about 10 minutes and there'll be a lot of folks giving up supper tonight squash everywhere they walk frogs frogs frogs brother Branham said they were piled up maybe 40. or 50 feet high so many frogs you know all them frogs didn't come out of the Nile never created because that's who God is he's a creator can you imagine places where they had piled them up 40 and 50 and they're just wiggling just working and wiggling and grossing everybody out I've seen some of you folks when a little tree frog gets on your glass door it's about that big and you scream like it like it's an iguana or something some of you folks would have never made it in Egypt that day everywhere frogs frogs frogs but God was trying to get the attention of pharaoh some years ago whether I was preaching in a youth camp in South Carolina are you still with me good because I'm not done preaching in a youth camp in South Carolina and I made some boys mad I know you can't imagine me making anybody mad as mild as I am but I made some boys mad they were strutting around there like roosters like they thought they were God's gift to the Youth Camp and I got tired of the way they were strutting around and I just walked by one day and I said you know what you fellas are a bunch of phonies you talk about getting their attention they said preacher what do you mean you were a bunch of phonies I said you realize before you got here you wasn't nothing but you made up your mind you was going to make everybody think you thought you were something but the truth is you're miserable your life is a wreck and you know that you're not ready to meet God and you strut in and out of the altar service like it's not affecting you but I know that it's affecting you I know God is talking to some of you and we don't have but about four more nights and I plan to pray with every one of you in the altar when you give your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ and they they weren't real rude they snickered a little bit and they said well we'll we'll see we'll see we'll see we'll see if that happened or not and so the next night I preached a message called one more night with the frogs I've been preaching on this for 40 years and so I watched them boys they weren't paying much attention to anything that I had to say that didn't matter there was about 250 other young campers that were in there with me and when we give the altar call the altar's filled up and I noticed them boys all going out and I thought you know too bad there's not somebody standing at the door to drive them back in there because they really need to be in that atmosphere and you could tell by the way they were slinking out of there that they were going for meanness little did I know that I was going to be the object of their meanness those boys about eight of them they went out through the woods and they gathered some frogs I don't mean them little kind about like that I mean frogs how many of you know not frog a frog anybody know the difference that's a frog these were frogs big old hand frogs they got all kinds really the truth is they had two or three big ones and a lot of little ones and those hoodlums slipped into the staff cabin where I had a room by myself and they turned those frogs and them frogs loose in my room while I was praying in the altars by the time a snack bar was done and we were back in the room them them frogs and them frogs had already found their place to be so I walked in I didn't see anything different I walked in the little bathroom to brush my teeth and I heard a noise and it was a frog in the bathtub I said ma how'd that thing get in here I said well I'm gonna brush my teeth before I get him out and I reached up for my glass to get my toothbrush out of it and there was a little bitty frog and I'm standing there thinking that must be the baby of that one that's over there in the tub so I go over and raise the wind and I throw those those little two little two ones out a big one and a little one out and as I'm going back over to get to the bed I flopped down I sit down on the bed going to take off my shoes gonna get ready for bed and I see one under the little twin bed on the other side of the room looking at me big eyes singing like brother Daniel was singing a minute ago the truth is it the last two I didn't find till the lights were out foreign if you've never had one crawl up the inside of your leg I was so aggravated agitated by that time I don't know if it was number 10 or number 15 that made me realize somebody has done this to me but I was pretty pretty hot and I made up my mind that I was going to preach boy when I get back to that Pulpit tomorrow I'm going to preach hell hotter than I have ever before I didn't have 40 or 50 feet of frogs I only had 25 or 30. so I can't begin to understand how Pharaoh felt but all I know is that I could have come up with a better answer come on come on if the camp director would have opened my door and said brother Shelley when do you want us to help get rid of these frogs I promise you after finding one in my bed my answer would not have been [Music] um tomorrow I'd had all the frogs I could take come on now there's some reason why Pharaoh wanted one more night with the frogs anybody with me frogs everywhere everywhere the show that God was in control Moses asked pharaoh to name the time he wanted the frogs removed when would you like for me to get those frogs out of the way you and I would have said yesterday and if we wouldn't have said yesterday we'd have said right now but Pharaoh said tomorrow Pharaoh could have this terrible plague come to an end and all those frogs removed from the land any time he chose the prophet put it in his hands and his answer was tomorrow can you figure it out for some morbid sick twisted strange reason Pharaoh wanted one more night with the frogs so Moses gave him what he wanted one more night with the frogs it is likely that Pharaoh did not really believe that the god of Moses had actually caused this plague he probably thought this situation had been caused by a natural phenomenon wanted one more night for the situation to kind of change on its own without God's help maybe he thought they'd just all die at one time or go away on their your own or maybe he was hoping that before Daybreak his magicians who also conjured up a few frogs maybe they maybe would be able to solve the problem then he could keep his slaves and he wouldn't have to deal with pharaoh and the children of Israel and the god of Moses then he wouldn't have to acknowledge that there was a god higher than the god of the lies or the god of the plagues or the god of the boils or The God nevertheless and for whatever reason Pharaoh chose to spend one more night with the frogs therefore allowing time according to scripture for his heart to begin to harden even more I want to ask you tonight and I want to get serious as we as we move into the Final Phase of this tonight what do these frogs prophesy to us today I don't know if you've ever heard a frog prophesy but I want some frogs to prophesy to us in this house tonight and I want to know what it is that you would choose to spend one more night with if I could guarantee you that there was a deliverer in the house I want to know what it is that you would choose to spend a little more time with have a little longer in your life instead of giving it to God and letting him take it away from you this evening speaks these frogs talk to us tonight about past tense the things that we hold on to even when the waters are troubled even when there's a going in the top of the mulberry tree and God is showing himself mighty even when there's a whisper among the people God is moving God is moving we've been saying this for months God is moving something's happening around here Jehovah sneaky is at it again wake your neighbor up punch him punch him kick him pinch them don't you let him sleep through this you can sleep through my stories but I want you to hear that there's got to be something somewhere that's causing some of us to choose to spend another night with our vice when the waters are troubled when the angel is stirring the top of the trees when the word has come forth as it has come forth the last three nights and we just halfway enter in we just halfway enter in just to appease our own feelings I want to know why some of you haven't made your way to the altar I'd like to know why some of you are waiting what were you waiting on to be called did you need a special invitation are there people here that won't move unless you sing just as I am or is it rather there are things that we are not quite ready to be free from are you still here this is not to be ugly it's not to be cantankerous tell you that there's something that holds us back sometime when God has come and he wants to pour out life on us and we're afraid we're going to have to commit well I want to tell you something we don't have church membership here you can't join this church you don't have enough money to join this church you can't pay your way in here come on there's only one way to be a part of his church which is much bigger than the four walls of this building we're talking about his universal church and The Only Name on that church is the Living Word Jesus Christ you you'll find that his church is not called Baptist or Pentecostal or Methodist his church is not even called message or charismatic or Episcopalian I'm talking about the Jesus church I'm talking about the one that lifts him higher than they left anything or anybody else we're not singing in here tonight about Sabino Canyon we're singing it here tonight I speak the name of Jesus over your anxiety over your depression who in the right mind would want to live another night in depression with anxiety when there's a way that's been made for you want to help me just a little bit I want to know what these frogs are prophesying to us tonight what is it that we're holding on to when God is sending a Word of Deliverance to us you heard the preacher frogs of unforgiveness frogs of bitterness you want to hold on to your anger One More Night because you want to make somebody else pay for what they did to you don't you know that's like acid in your soul don't you know that withholding your forgiveness is not affecting that other person nearly as much help me preach nearly as much as this affecting you you're the one that's forming cancer cells you're the one that's harming heart disease you're the one that's getting high blood pressure somebody said you're just making that up absolutely not absolutely not I have a research that says that nearly 90 percent of all disease is emotional now wait a minute that doesn't mean made up in your head it means the product of something that was going on in your life emotionally so you can make fun of that and dismiss it as Hocus Pocus but I want you to know the brain research is there that you know there's power in even looking positively when you're looking death in the face the statistics will tell us that lives are expanded and quality of life is expanded when people have the right attitude about what they're going through and when somebody gives them a death sentence when they gave my grandmother a death sentence she looked right back at the doctor and she said Sir with all my heart I appreciate you and I'm going to need you and the last thing I want to do is offend you but she said there's one thing you need to know about me I'm not going to die because you've told me to die he started laughing she said I know that you're telling me to the best of your knowledge but you said she said but I don't believe that even my body dictates the day of my death she said I don't even believe my disease is going to choose the day I die no she said I believe God's going to choose the day I die and I'm not going to die because the doctor told me to die so she said don't you be offended but I'm holding on to something and you know God extended her life and gave her better quality of life and let her be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ long after the doctor said said she wouldn't make it he knows how so don't tell me the toxic thoughts don't have an awful horrible effect on the physical form of the body disease I'm telling you I have research here that says somewhere between 72 percent and 90 percent of all disease is caused by toxic emotions that have never been dealt with that have been held on to because somebody said I'm going to spend another night with my unforgiveness I'm going to spend another night with my bitterness come on I don't know what to say to Thrill you but I didn't come tonight to Thrill you I came tonight to get this out of the way I won't this out of the way I want every person that God might speak to tonight to make up your mind that it doesn't matter what your frog is you don't have to wait till tomorrow to get rid of it you can get rid of it now frogs of anger do you know anger is killing people it's eating them alive it's causing them to go insane anger holding on to anger some people are angry husbands angry fathers angry mothers angry hi nurse is angry School teachers angry preachers angry and if you don't learn how to deal with that and throw it on the one who can help you with it it'll affect every phase of who you are it'll shut you out when the blessings of God are flowing all around you when others are entering into the deep Waters of the spirit you'll stand on the shore only wishing you could feel a little touch of God or a little feel of his grace or his presence you say no preacher I don't need a feeling no no it's not a feeling but it's feeling sometime that we're holding on to so that we can't encounter him frogs of addiction frogs of lust you mean one more look one more look is worth letting that water that's troubled and that that tree that's stirring and a God in the Mist who says I want to help you you mean one more look at that smut you mean somebody would choose one more night with pornography when they could be free because Jesus died to free us all is anybody with me frogs of rebellion frogs of authority issues let me tell you there's people in this room tonight you've just got a problem with any kind of authority but your own well I want to tell you something you have to learn one of these days brother sister that every one of us answer to somebody at some time in our life and I'm not saying this because we have a civil servants here and people who serve the community but I think it's absolutely insane for somebody to think that we can have less protection and and create a safer world we need more officers we need more men and women that'll help protect us from the wildness of this old world we need a whole lot more of that because there's a lot of insanity around us I want you to know we're living now in a place I thought this used to be a safe place to live just this week they come in and kill a grandmother and a little little tiny baby over here across the river just this week the world is in trouble and the church is not doing what the church ought to be doing because we're over here stroking our frogs we're petting our feelings we're petting our addictions frogs of greed frogs of rebellion frogs of authority issues frogs of addictions pills alcohol food Red Bulls come on addictions you don't think I'm gonna preach on a food addiction and not talk about a Red Bull addiction do you yeah my mother got addicted to chapstick I didn't want her to be bound but chapstick I don't believe it's God's will for you to be bound to anything but the word of God [Applause] I don't believe there's anything that ought to have power and control over our lives but the holy spirit of God and the word of truth I don't think we ought to be a slave to the coffee cup anybody knows I really do enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning and I am not very talkative without it I'm honest I'll be honest I don't drink it all through the day but that's because I know that in excess is certainly not good for me but I don't want to be a slave to that because some days I don't get the coffee and I still have to function I don't want anything to hold me that way is anybody with me frogs of guilt condemnation guilty past the enemy trying to lie to you and keep you from accepting God's grace because of something you've done insecurity are people who'd rather sleep with the frogs of insecurity than to let Jesus just remake them with confidence and boldness and strength of who he would want them to be let me tell you something God can remake you he can pick up our broken twisted affected dysfunctional lives and fill us with so much life that our own family doesn't recognize Who We Are today you let old Jesse over there on the front row hold up your hand Jesse when God saved him when God began to do a work in his life I want you to know it made enough it made us a a speech it made an effect it spoke I'll get it out in a minute it spoke to his family both sides it come time to baptize him he didn't just have parents and and their new companion stepmom and stepdad and and brothers into I want you to know look to me like the whole Community come out to watch Jesse be baptized because they were so proud so thankful so affected by the fact that God had made such a difference in his life somebody wanted to celebrate it with him they didn't all get baptized they didn't all join the church but they wanted to celebrate with him that God had made a difference in his life come on go all the way around this room it happened the same way I gotta hurry frogs of of Shame frogs of apathy indifference frogs of worry frogs of fear there's things going on in our lives right now that at one time caused our heart to tremble and our knees to bow things that we once bragged about how we could handle them are now handling us one more night with the frogs urges that we once controlled are now controlling us how many more nights you want to spend out of control because you've let some little pill control your life or you've just let some Unholy desire or unnatural desire control your life you really want one more night with it when Jesus is standing here tonight to say if you'll trust me with your love I will set you free from the top of your head to the souls of your feet somebody said but it's not always instantaneous you're right but he don't turn loose of you once you commit to him he's going to hold on to you brother Branham lost his wife he lost his little precious baby girl Sharon Rose in the Ohio flood and the and the pneumonia and the tuberculosis and all the diseases that affected those people because of the of the Ohio river that that flooded Louisville Kentucky and Jeffersonville Indiana he's standing over his little baby girl jerking and terrible fever and dying and sister hope his wife is buried later they go and open up the grave and lay that little casket down on top of Mother's casket because brother Brandon made a promise that if that happened that way he would bury her in her mother's arms here he's a preacher here he has given his life for God God was calling him to some things that he wasn't quite willing to do and God knew how to knock on his door and I know that makes some people mad that's not judgment that's Grace as love that's love hope had a home she had a place to go Sharon Rose had a place to go brother Branham standing on the side of the highway his body's shaking with tears is he standing there day after day grieving over the loss and an elected official in the in the place in the in the community comes by and sees him standing out there and he said now's my chance to stop and see if I can say a good word to Bill and encourage him somehow and he walks up to the Grave some of you have been there I I have been right there on the side of the road sister hope is buried not too far from the edge of the road there and he walks up that little Knoll and stood there beside brother Bannon put his arm around him bill I've been thinking about you they talk on a few minutes and he said I want to know something how have you held on to your religion we know it's not religion it's faith but this is how he was talking how have you held on to your religion I've been wondering how you've been holding on to it he said oh no you need to understand I'm not holding on to hit I'm not holding on to my religion or my faith it's holding on to me that's what faith does we've grown so accustomed to our frogs anybody still here we're so familiar with our frogs until they become a part of our identity you know I've actually met people that didn't want to be healed because they were going to have to walk right it can be an emotional bondage I've met people that didn't want to get rid of some of the things that were tormenting them because they would have to discover who they really should be that's what fear will do that's what the enemy will do we're serving a God who said old things have passed away behold what all those things become new we've grown so accustomed so familiar with our frogs that even when we have an opportunity to be free from them sometime we choose them we choose them again and again and again we've played so long and we've cuddled with what seemed like a little harmless baby worm so long until now it's revealed itself as a Viper that's out to destroy our lives and we don't know how to put it down because we've cuddled it for so long some of these frogs some of these things that are out to destroy that are out to torment we've known too long what we needed to do we needed to get rid of those things we needed to ask the Lord for help we needed Deliverance but instead we've chosen another night petting our hurt feelings waiting on somebody to come and apologize to us that's Pride you're going to have to learn by the grace of God as we all learn to forgive whether anybody ever gets around to saying I'm sorry or not unforgiveness is not a frog you want to hold on to I tell you what just get to a place where you can just forgive because you know it's the right thing to do and keep walking we keep putting off what needs to be dealt with now people will say I'll get my heart right in the next Revival when camp meeting comes I'm going to really enter in the preacher certain preacher I like when he comes I'm really gonna make up my mind then but instead it's like it's like the scripture said in Acts 24 when Paul is standing before Felix and he's witnessing to him and Felix is Almost Persuaded he's almost ready but right about the moment that he would accept this truth he said go thy way for this time when I have a convenient season I will call for thee I'm told a story can I have 10 more minutes I'm told a story about an eagle that was circling and frozen tundra and saw a little broken piece of ice with one little lamb on it a piece that had broken off and carried this little stray lamb away from the safety of of the fold of the other lambs and hear this little piece of ice was floating down the river just enough water that wasn't Frozen to carry right out in the middle of the river to carry that little piece of ice down the river and just be on was a real waterfall and is that eagle looked down and saw that little lamb there it purposed in its own instinct he certainly had the Vantage of being able to see what was ahead anybody that knows anything about the nature of an eagle knows it's a very intelligent bird it certainly must know that danger was just ahead but this Eagle was counting on the fact that he would be able to swoop down and and have that little lamb for a meal just before that little piece of ice went over the waterfall and so he landed on that little piece of ice as it was floating very slowly along and he began to make his feast on that little lamb that was destined for death anyway when he recognized by the sound of the water that he was about to go over the fall he said now's my time to exit so to speak and you just raised up his wings and he began to Flap and those wings that had lifted him out of danger hundreds of times before failed him in that moment you see the warmth of his body the very heat of his Talons had melted the ice enough that he was adhered to the ice melted enough to hold him there as the temperature caused the ice to freeze over his Talons and what he thought would save him because it had saved him many many many many times before it failed him now because he did not anticipate the unexpected he thought he had jobs just enough time you know a knowledge of this message without a born-again experience is one of the most dangerous things you can possess because you know so much about how things are going to unfold that you keep telling yourself I got more time I got a little more time in order how much time but I got a little more time why in the world would you bargain for a little more time so that you could spend one more night with the things that have made you so miserable anyway I'm gonna tell you something unbelief is misery addiction is misery doubting the word is misery unforgiveness and bitterness is misery lust is Misery all addiction misery there's no joy in it it's only a moment of ecstasy only a moment of satisfaction sin can never satisfy but for a moment the reason why I wanted to tell that those stories because we've been told by the word of God that the Overcomer is an eagle and that's the reason why I said it's one of the most dangerous things you can possess is a knowledge of this truth because you start bargaining with what you've heard the prophet say and you say wait a minute this hadn't happened yet so you're not playing Monopoly children you said in the game of of life on the board game this isn't jumping spaces and buying hotels and no no no this is eternity that we're playing with you see like Moses you've got a Destiny and a call on your life and you are going to serve God I want to tell you something there are people under the sound of my voice right now that are not serving God you're going to serve God how do you know because I know he's jealousy over his children and I want to just be honest and I am not anybody that knows me knows I'm not some to call in fact to be honest with you I rarely give them you don't hear me telling Sam had stories to try to get people to move it's very unusual for me so I was very shocked after after we we the tone was set last night and I come in here and God has asked me to preach in Evangelistic message so I thought and I struggled and I wrestled but I realized that we've got two more services and we need to go somewhere because some of you are going home in a day or two and God forbid you go back the way you came somebody said all right preacher I'm doing pretty good I know that I know you're getting high but I don't want anybody to go home tonight exactly like they came in [Music] everybody to have encountered this touch I want everybody if you haven't felt him I want you to at least be able to say I saw him yeah I saw him moving on others maybe you didn't feel it for yourself but you must have known there was a shift in the atmosphere when his presence began to move in here the truth is he comes without the drums he comes without the song it comes when we invite him come on now the enemy will use all kinds of distractions to keep us from recognizing Our Moment our hour I think my 10 minutes is about up I want to tell you that delay is dangerous it was for the eagle I want to tell you that procrastination leads to infestation because if I know anything about frogs they have more than one or two babies frogs just reproduce and they rep anybody had a swimming pool that the frogs got in you go out one day there's not a there's not an egg Sac anywhere you go out the next day and they have I'm talking about salt or chlorine what have you got they didn't taste the water they just laid their eggs there and you see these big old stringy sacks of eggs and you better do something about them because they're going to hatch and when they do you're going to have some frogs and you may end up like us with some frogs oh do we got some big ones that like to get in Irish from time to time procrastination leads to infestation frogs beget frogs if you don't deal with the frogs they just keep having frogs not tomorrow no musicians are coming now out your frogs leave this place without your frogs roll them on him make up your mind that God is a god of change you know we're pretty famous for our promises about tomorrow what we're going to do tomorrow I'll do that tomorrow we pledge to start eating better tomorrow thinking better tomorrow exercising more tomorrow organizing our closets better tomorrow cleaning out the garage tomorrow watch me I'm preaching they're just walking they're not interesting to worry less tomorrow seems that our designated moment to always start our personal transformation it's tomorrow tomorrow I love you tomorrow you're always a day away we love tomorrow but the word of God says in Hebrews 3 7 and 8 wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today [Music] if you will hear his voice his voice hard to not your heart pharaoh and choose another night with the frogs if this Jesus is real and you know he is and if he can really help me with my stuff why not give it to him tonight why not try what do you got to lose somebody said I don't want to be embarrassed let me tell you life is full of embarrassments I had a little embarrassing moment earlier today but I just made up my mind I'm going to do this because it's the right thing to do and we have to do that sometime even if it puts us out there a little bit I want to tell you something you may not know this is a safe place we've seen a lot of things we've seen mascara run I don't know why you'd want that stuff you get under that presence of God and the first thing happened to some rolling down your cheeks that don't scare me I've seen spiders fall off of people's eyes when they got emotional that didn't scare me I knew they had glued them on I've seen fingernails come on I've seen people get under the spirit of God in the wig drop I've seen people speaking tongues and their teeth fall out that didn't scare me you know what them folks did they just reached down got them deep I've seen preachers do it I've been in Services where they popped out hit a metal foe hit the pulpit hit a metal phone and chair flew up through the air in the preacher went that didn't scare me I've seen people wallow around and Alder into their blouse was untucked elastic skirt come that didn't scare us no no we know how to help you We're not gonna let you be indecent this is a safe place I'm not saying you do any of that you might stand like a stoic Soldier and never show you the emotion none of that matters to me you don't have to act like I act to get help I have to worship like I worship to be right it'll be a Holy Roller to be right but there ain't nothing wrong with Holy Rollers I'll tell you that right now some of the finest folks I know Are Holy Rollers I remember when the power of God used to fall and people couldn't hold themselves up I've seen denominational people who didn't believe in the Holy Ghost get under the power of God and do some pretty outlandish exciting things but the Holy Ghost is a gentleman he's not here to embarrass you you may not even move forward you may sit at your seat and call on the Lord it does not matter to me how you touch him tonight but I must tell you that I came here knowing that somebody had to call an end to the frogs somebody has got to make a move deny toward God and say Lord it'll be a journey but I'm starting I don't know how long play something I don't know how long it'll take me to get to where I want to be but I'm starting this journey tonight I don't know how long it'll take me to get rid of the pills I don't know how long it'll take me to get rid of the nicotine I don't know how long it'll take me to get rid of the alcohol I don't know how long it'll take me to control my chocolate cake urge because we all know it's hard to stop with one piece I don't know how long it'll take me to get to where I'm going but I got to start somewhere I don't want no more frogs when do you want to get rid of those things [Music] we'll feed you if it's midnight well I don't have to give up that boy friend I want to tell you something I don't care if he's tagged with gold he's not worth your soul I wish somebody help me right now some young man said I'd like to serve God but I'd have to give up that whole trampy girl I run with did you just say that yeah and I cleaned it up for visitors I want to tell you something I don't care how she Wiggles her tail she is not worth your soul foreign they're not the only fish in the sea God's got somebody for you I believe God's got somebody for you if you have to compromise who you are to hold on to I don't understand the spirit that gets on young women and now now middle-aged women and they're looking for bad boys I don't know what's going on in your life or in your childhood that attracts you to losers like that [Music] I'm preaching now you better make up your mind you need somebody that'll love God and let me tell you something says you want a man that'll love God more than you if you've been telling yourself I want a man that'll love me more than anything else in the world he don't exist let's be brutally honest he doesn't exist because he if he doesn't love God he loves his self and his stuff his Budweiser yeah and his boat and he may love you when he needs you but that's not near enough to satisfy the longing in your soul fast the woman at the well she had all kinds of men she had a rich one and a poor one and a fat one and a smart one and a dumb one and yeah she had a James Dean one and a Chris Pratt one and I don't even know who some of these people are just heard their names and none of them satisfied until she met the seventh man Jesus said you've well said you're not married you've had five husbands and the one you're living with right now is number six and everything she needed was in the seventh one and he was standing right there that said you drink this water you'll thirst again [Music] the man dissatisfied that long and in your soul but if you let me I'll give you water I'll give you water to drink and you'll never want any other will the run back after Harry or dick or Larry or whatever name is once you taste this water Jesus said you'll find what you're looking for higher he's better than the thrill the the no The Knowing of eternal life is better than the thrill of sex it's better than the thrill of the pillar or the liquor or anything else that gives you even a half a moment of goodness or feeling or releases some chemicals in your in your body I'm telling you nothing can say especially because he saw you but but I've so disappointed the Lord yeah we have but you didn't take him by surprise he knew you before the foundation of the world he knew you were he knew you were gonna go look in here and you're gonna go look in there he knew that and he loved you anyway I'm not doing just yet but almost he loved you anyway and he came looking for you so nothing you said well if he just knew if he just knew do you know what we're talking about now we're not talking about the priest or talk about the Lord Jesus you don't you don't know anything he don't know about you you've never done anything he don't already know you've never been anywhere he didn't see you oh but nobody know he know he and he's still calling you tonight he's still drawing you tonight because you're not trash you're not trash you're actually bone of his bone you're actually flesh of his flesh when he saw you in his foreknowledge he gave you a prefix destiny and he determined an hour that he would reach your life and you would be tired of the frogs and you'd say all the way with Jesus no matter what it looks like somebody said I'm so afraid they're gonna make me put a little bun on the back of my head nobody's trying to make you a grandma home we're just trying to tell you that you have no choice but to obey the word of God won't you worry about something like that way later don't worry about that now worry about just saying yes to him well they're going to make me wear a dress or they're going to make me wear them a dress below my knee or they're gonna they're gonna what in the world are you talking about we're not preaching religion tonight you can't get clean enough for him no you can't be holy enough for him you could wear your dress under your chin and and hide your toes and not be holy enough but one drop one drop of his Precious Blood cleanses you from all of your sin let's stand in this house tonight just one drop there's one drop just one drop a police officer was walking around in a vacant field and he saw a big old covert there and he looked inside and he saw a boy squatted down in that culvert he said my that's strange and so he went over to the cupboard and he leaned down he said boy what are you doing in there he said I'm I'm hiding here I'm well I'm really living here he said well you're no more than 13 years old what do you mean you're living in a culvert yes sir he said if my daddy could find me he'd kill me and the police said well I guess I'd make you want to live in a a covert if you're dad was wanting to kill you he said but what makes you think that he wants to kill you well I ran away I was ashamed of some things I'd done and I ran away and my dad told me if I ever run away and he found me he would he would kill me and the police officer said how about I reach out to your dad oh no I don't want you to do that he said no I have to I can't leave you here like this he called the dad on the phone and he said sir I'm calling to tell you I found your teenage son oh you you found him we've been looking everywhere for him he's been gone two weeks we've not been able to locate him anywhere he said well sir I'm sorry to tell you he's been living in a culvert down on an empty lot in downtown no telling the conditions that he's had to live and I he doesn't even look like he's had a good good meal and he said I'll be right there the police officer said so you're not mad at him he said oh no if I was mad at him I couldn't be mad at him now I want to know that he's safe I want to know that he's all right that's all we ever wanted to know was that he was all right we were scared to death here come a man and his wife they jumped out of the car and they ran over there to the police officer and they grabbed that boy they wrapped their arms around him and they wept and the police officer he said to himself this doesn't look like a an abusive situation no the little boy had just made up in his mind though there were some Angry Words exchanged daddy said some ugly things we daddies can do that from time to time but it doesn't mean we'd ever want any harm to come to our own he said you mean to tell me that you're going to take your boy you're ready to take him back and oh yeah I said his bed's there waiting on him and and there'll be a warm meal for him he's ours we want to take care of him and we've wanted to all along and the law officer looked at the boy and he said oh what a shame what a shame son you've spent two weeks in this Culvert doing without a meal doing without a blanket doing without a safe and warm home to live in and the loving Embrace of your parents and you didn't have to spend one single night in this cupboard because there was a bedroom with your name on it and a warm meal and a mom and a dad who loved you but you had made up in your mind that they didn't want you and that they were going to cause your harm and you know what that's like we do sometime we choose the culvert because we're afraid that we've disappointed him so that he'll never be able to accept us back into his loving arms but I want you to know he stands in eternity tonight with his arms stretched out and he says I don't care what you've done I don't care where you've been you are mine there's a warm meal waiting on you there's a safe bed for you to sleep in you don't have to live in a hole in the ground anymore you can come
