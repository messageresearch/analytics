[47:47] sister Jaya I believe they passed word
[47:49] to me that you had a song today we want
[47:51] to invite you to come and sing we're
[47:53] going to receive the tithe and offering
[47:55] as they're coming and getting ready I
[47:57] would like to uh remind you that two
[48:00] weeks from now is our fellowship meeting
[48:02] on the weekend of the 5th and the 6th on
[48:06] that weekend we will receive an offering
[48:09] for the principle of the mortgage of
[48:12] this building I'll get to that in just a
[48:14] moment what I would like to say first is
[48:16] the grounds need to be mowed and trimmed
[48:20] and and and the Under the Tent there's
[48:23] going to take some manpower to move
[48:25] tables to get that all cleaned up and so
[48:27] I will not be here next weekend so I'm
[48:30] going to throw this all on my son Nathan
[48:32] so I'm asking you if Nathan does not
[48:34] have your phone number will you please
[48:37] make sure brothers that he does have
[48:39] your phone number so when he is getting
[48:41] ready to uh mow and trim and so forth
[48:45] that he can reach out for some help we
[48:47] don't want to put this all on him he
[48:49] can't do it by himself although at times
[48:51] he'd like to try but we want to make
[48:54] sure that the grounds are beautiful for
[48:56] the fellowship uh so that would probably
[49:00] have to happen next weekend so if you
[49:03] can help out doing that
[49:06] you can we ask Nathan to give them a
[49:09] little bit of a heads up because
[49:11] sometimes if it's the morning of or even
[49:13] the evening before people have made
[49:15] plans and we don't want them to do that
[49:16] yeah give them a good notice a couple
[49:18] days if possible and uh perhaps he can
[49:21] even utilize the um the app to be able
[49:25] to reach out to you so he can tell when
[49:28] he's going to do that and give you some
[49:29] notice I would like to report to you
[49:32] that a 5500 payment was made is that
[49:35] right this week and so the amount owed

[1:06:54] you may be seated you've been standing
[1:06:57] for quite a while and I want you to have
[1:07:00] a little rest while we share a few
[1:07:03] things with you
[1:07:05] if you are streaming this service today
[1:07:08] would you go into the chat and put where
[1:07:13] you're from we would like to do that
[1:07:16] over the course of the next few weeks we
[1:07:19] would like to know where people are from
[1:07:21] who are streaming the service and we
[1:07:24] respect the fact that some of you want
[1:07:27] to remain anonymous
[1:07:29] and uh
[1:07:31] may I say that if you're streaming on
[1:07:34] Facebook you're not completely anonymous
[1:07:38] because your friends can see when you
[1:07:41] join
[1:07:45] so many are being exposed around the
[1:07:48] world
[1:07:49] because they don't know that Facebook
[1:07:51] has that little feature and I'm getting
[1:07:54] screenshots sent to me from three or
[1:07:57] four continents
[1:07:59] so uh uh
[1:08:03] hahaha
[1:08:06] no we're so blessed uh there are
[1:08:09] hundreds of Ministries around this
[1:08:12] message thousands around the Christian
[1:08:14] faith that stream their services and we
[1:08:18] are pioneers I I'm thankful that we had
[1:08:22] a vision a long time ago before this
[1:08:25] streaming stuff was was possible I
[1:08:29] opened up an old Bible of mine a few
[1:08:32] days ago and found a note in brother
[1:08:35] Wallace's handwriting to tell me who all
[1:08:39] was streaming the service a whole list
[1:08:42] and it wasn't streaming then it was
[1:08:44] telephone hookup
[1:08:46] and uh so we've been at this a long time
[1:08:49] and that's why people have tried to buy
[1:08:52] our our
[1:08:54] domainrevival.org and uh we will it's
[1:08:56] not for sale no no no we we we got it
[1:09:00] just as there was an internet breaking
[1:09:03] forth
[1:09:04] and I remember I've told this before but
[1:09:07] I remember sitting in the in the
[1:09:09] apartment and the offices upstairs at
[1:09:11] the church in Columbus
[1:09:13] and uh Kevin was on the other end of the
[1:09:17] of the computer in Edmonton Alberta
[1:09:20] Canada I'm looking at a black screen it
[1:09:24] was kind of like playing Atari like I
[1:09:25] mentioned last week just a blank screen
[1:09:28] and all of a sudden a little cursor
[1:09:31] appeared on the blank screen
[1:09:34] my I'm feeling old
[1:09:38] no texting
[1:09:40] no smartphones
[1:09:42] only a few cellular phones and they were
[1:09:46] bag phones about that big
[1:09:49] pagers were big
[1:09:51] I think at one time I had one on each
[1:09:53] hip
[1:09:55] and uh but I'll never forget seeing my
[1:09:58] name Hey Brother Shelly
[1:10:02] I jumped up and down I got up out of the
[1:10:05] chair I jumped all over the office I
[1:10:07] said this is the most wonderful
[1:10:09] invention that has ever been made and
[1:10:11] it's going to make it possible for us to
[1:10:13] send our services to the world and all
[1:10:16] it was was just a little chat an inside
[1:10:18] chat going on between brother Kevin and
[1:10:21] I and now look what we have uh an app
[1:10:24] where we can stream right on our phone
[1:10:26] somebody said aren't you concerned about
[1:10:28] the filth that is uh that is on the
[1:10:31] internet I'm very concerned about it but
[1:10:33] it's not going anywhere
[1:10:35] it's not going anywhere if anything it
[1:10:38] will increase and so all we can do is
[1:10:41] not get caught in that trap
[1:10:44] but use
[1:10:45] I'm going to tell this because I I feel
[1:10:48] a little something unusual here this
[1:10:50] morning
[1:10:52] now you know my grandmother was a
[1:10:54] preacher she was a pastor and when she
[1:10:56] heard this message she stepped down
[1:10:58] because of the word what the word said
[1:11:01] but she had been doing it she was
[1:11:03] ordained in the Assemblies of God in
[1:11:05] 1949 and 50 somewhere in there and so
[1:11:10] she had been doing it a long time my
[1:11:12] granny was Assembly of God but she was a
[1:11:14] Holy Roller she didn't cut her hair she
[1:11:17] didn't wear pants like they all do today
[1:11:20] and uh she didn't wear makeup and she
[1:11:24] didn't wear jewelry and every now and
[1:11:26] again she would wear a pen if she had a
[1:11:29] dress that didn't come tight together
[1:11:31] she would wear a little pen there or
[1:11:33] something small I think I've got a
[1:11:35] picture of her back there with a little
[1:11:37] Shepherd's crook for a little pen that
[1:11:39] someone had given her and she had had
[1:11:43] some new dresses made and they had made
[1:11:46] the sleeve shorter than she liked and
[1:11:49] she wore one to the pulpit she wore one
[1:11:51] out on the platform and the spirit of
[1:11:53] the Lord this is her testimony convicted
[1:11:56] her and told her that that wasn't she
[1:11:58] wasn't covered enough and so she went
[1:12:00] and had him to add something on that's
[1:12:02] just just how my granny was and she was
[1:12:05] in a service and they were uh preaching
[1:12:08] against television now this would have
[1:12:10] been in the early 50s and they were
[1:12:13] preaching against television and she
[1:12:15] said I knew everything they were saying
[1:12:17] was right
[1:12:19] I knew that what they were saying was
[1:12:21] right that Satan was going to use it
[1:12:24] that it was going to put filth in
[1:12:26] people's living rooms that there would
[1:12:28] be adultery on it there would be alcohol
[1:12:31] there would be smoking on it and
[1:12:34] everyone would have I knew everything
[1:12:35] they were saying was right but something
[1:12:38] in my heart was turning differently in
[1:12:40] that moment and she said I was sitting
[1:12:43] on the platform listening to the
[1:12:44] preacher and at the end of the service
[1:12:46] the spirit of the Lord came on her she
[1:12:49] said I stood and began to prophesy and
[1:12:52] the Word was something like this I the
[1:12:54] Lord hath seen this I see the evil I I
[1:12:58] know the end from the beginning but I
[1:13:01] want to say to my people that I will
[1:13:03] take what the enemy has meant for evil
[1:13:08] I will use it to reach my seed around
[1:13:11] the world
[1:13:13] and she you would have never moved her
[1:13:16] off of that prophecy she said that the
[1:13:18] Lord spoke and said that he would use
[1:13:20] the medium of television and you all
[1:13:23] know that he has that he is he's used
[1:13:27] our brother Erickson in Iceland to send
[1:13:30] the gospel into Palestine the
[1:13:33] Palestinian territories
[1:13:35] and the gospel has gone in we were we
[1:13:39] had people in Janine and in Ramallah
[1:13:42] that we're watching our program when
[1:13:45] normal television couldn't even get in
[1:13:47] or get out and God was letting satellite
[1:13:51] take the the message of Truth and so we
[1:13:54] always have to keep our balance
[1:13:56] and that being said you have the gospel
[1:13:59] so you don't need one
[1:14:02] I'm just being honest don't look at me
[1:14:05] like that you don't need it
[1:14:06] you may want it and you may have it but
[1:14:09] you don't need it
[1:14:11] it's not a necessity
[1:14:13] you can get your highlights on the news
[1:14:17] what do you call it I started say facts
[1:14:19] to you
[1:14:20] boy Squad
[1:14:24] but you don't need it
[1:14:25] Christians don't need it we have
[1:14:28] everything we need if we have the word
[1:14:30] of God the message of the Hour come on
[1:14:33] you're some of you right now sitting
[1:14:35] here wouldn't be in the mess you're in
[1:14:37] right now
[1:14:38] if you didn't feed the other side of Who
[1:14:40] You Are
[1:14:42] hello
[1:14:45] it's the truth
[1:14:47] so we are thankful for the streaming we
[1:14:51] are thankful for YouTube I don't know
[1:14:53] what all is on YouTube I don't care I
[1:14:56] don't watch it I don't look for it but I
[1:14:58] know one thing God is using YouTube for
[1:15:01] the message of the hour to go out and
[1:15:04] he's using Facebook he's using the app
[1:15:07] he's using the website and I want to
[1:15:09] give God praise I just want to thank him
[1:15:12] for doing that
[1:15:15] thank you
[1:15:18] we are getting ready to restock our
[1:15:21] inventory of the Supernatural series
[1:15:24] it's a reprinted book six is reprinted
[1:15:28] now there was almost uh somewhere
[1:15:30] between 12 and 18 months that we
[1:15:32] couldn't even get the last book of the
[1:15:34] series it was out of print it has been
[1:15:37] reprinted now and we are getting ready
[1:15:40] to restock it's going to be expensive to
[1:15:42] do that hundreds of dollars to restock
[1:15:45] what we need because we want them to be
[1:15:47] available the price will drop because
[1:15:50] they've got a better deal on the on the
[1:15:53] printing and so if you have uh had a
[1:15:56] book if you've taken a book if you've
[1:15:58] asked for a book from the Supernatural
[1:16:01] series there are two or three families
[1:16:04] that have and you've not yet paid for
[1:16:06] them would you do that now today before
[1:16:09] you leave
[1:16:11] um so that we can use that money we
[1:16:13] don't when we were traveling and we had
[1:16:16] a big product table we had an account
[1:16:18] and it had money in it all the time
[1:16:20] because everything that we sold on the
[1:16:23] road went to the ministry I didn't take
[1:16:25] any of it personally we don't have that
[1:16:28] account anymore because most of
[1:16:30] everything we have is free online and so
[1:16:33] we don't really have the extra funds to
[1:16:35] do that so if you will help us in the
[1:16:37] get that taken care of today that would
[1:16:40] be great also to you streamers
[1:16:44] we have had two families one from
[1:16:46] Missouri one from Kentucky who have had
[1:16:50] their tithe check returned to them I
[1:16:54] have looked at the envelopes I can't see
[1:16:57] anything wrong with the address uh
[1:17:00] sister Terry for one she just stuck hers
[1:17:03] in another envelope wrote the same
[1:17:05] address and it came to us and the same
[1:17:08] thing happened to brother and sister
[1:17:09] brother Truman and and sister Martha
[1:17:12] Miller in Missouri would you all help me
[1:17:14] pray that if someone is you know I don't
[1:17:17] know how they do it anymore more sort it
[1:17:19] wrong or or return it or whatever
[1:17:21] they're doing uh we could we need the
[1:17:24] finances we need them always to keep
[1:17:26] doing what we're doing and I I don't
[1:17:29] need that we don't need to have to wait
[1:17:31] another 10 15 days on on a check to come
[1:17:34] back to us I wouldn't have mentioned it
[1:17:36] if it was just one but since there's
[1:17:38] been two now uh I'll mention that to the
[1:17:41] streamers if it returns back to you just
[1:17:44] put it in another envelope and and and
[1:17:46] put the address uh on and always
[1:17:49] remember we have the app and and the
[1:17:51] website for giving as well and no it's
[1:17:55] not as convenient for some people but
[1:17:57] you never know with the mail and the
[1:17:59] price keeps going up to mail something
[1:18:01] and really it's just uh just a difficult
[1:18:04] thing brother Greely has already
[1:18:06] mentioned the fellowship I know you all
[1:18:09] are still here
[1:18:11] I'm very aware just wanted you all to
[1:18:13] know I hadn't forgot you

[1:18:46] forward to what God's going to do that
[1:18:47] weekend something tells me he's going to
[1:18:50] show up
[1:18:51] Hallelujah
[1:18:53] I found something pretty special earlier
[1:18:55] in this service
[1:18:57] I got pretty excited all their my faith
[1:19:00] just started jumping up and down and
[1:19:03] then some of you started pouting about
[1:19:04] what something I said I don't know and
[1:19:07] that will lift it'll lift if we let it I
[1:19:09] don't want it to lift
[1:19:11] I want to thank Brother David Mann I
[1:19:13] don't want to advertise for you because
[1:19:16] I I may need you and I don't want you to
[1:19:18] be busy with anybody else
[1:19:20] but I want to thank Brother David Mann
[1:19:22] and and David Jr uh for helping Benjamin
[1:19:26] and Jenna yesterday their air
[1:19:28] conditioning went out this week we need
[1:19:30] Benjamin here leading worship and uh not
[1:19:34] melting and uh it was hot can you
[1:19:37] imagine in the 90s in the in the mobile
[1:19:40] home and uh he came out and charged it
[1:19:43] but that wasn't going to help us and
[1:19:44] whatever else he was doing trying to fix
[1:19:46] it so they had to replace that unit a
[1:19:49] great expense in in uh in the America
[1:19:52] that we live in you know that's when you
[1:19:54] really realize there's inflation when
[1:19:56] you see that prices have doubled on
[1:19:58] certain things but God was good to them
[1:20:00] Brother David was able with his son to
[1:20:03] come spend all day in the heat
[1:20:05] installing the unit tearing out a wall
[1:20:07] doing all kinds of things to get it done
[1:20:09] he gave up his day off for my family and
[1:20:13] I want to thank you so much both of you

[1:21:03] we want to send a happy birthday to
[1:21:05] Gregory as well God bless you
[1:21:08] [Applause]
[1:21:10] all right I have two announcements that
[1:21:13] I need to make this morning one of them
[1:21:16] is a little sad but don't be sad it's
[1:21:19] going to be okay God always makes a way
[1:21:24] amen a couple months ago no excuse me
[1:21:28] about a month ago four weeks ago
[1:21:30] something like that we found out through
[1:21:33] the grapevine that our apartment in
[1:21:36] Jerusalem was being sold
[1:21:38] now that was very hard to hear very hard
[1:21:41] to hear it's still very hard to hear I
[1:21:45] mentioned brother Greeley that I had
[1:21:46] gotten the confirmation this morning and
[1:21:48] I said but I don't want to talk about it
[1:21:51] and I didn't and I don't I don't want to
[1:21:54] talk about it but I want to give God an
[1:21:56] opportunity to move
[1:21:58] so we prayed I didn't say anything to
[1:22:01] many people about it because it brought
[1:22:04] up so many raw emotions for me and I'm
[1:22:07] thinking now Lord here we are just now
[1:22:10] believing
[1:22:11] that we're entering into a cycle where
[1:22:14] we're really going to need it and we're
[1:22:16] losing it
[1:22:17] so it's hard and uh but God has been
[1:22:20] good to me over the last few weeks he's
[1:22:22] given me a vision and a heart for for
[1:22:25] Israel again he has showed me a few
[1:22:27] things that I cannot share with you this
[1:22:30] morning but I will share with you at
[1:22:31] some point that I believe God is very
[1:22:34] much concerned about our connection in
[1:22:37] the land and I believe that we are to
[1:22:40] have an apartment in Jerusalem until the
[1:22:42] Rapture and when that takes place we
[1:22:44] won't need it anymore and they can do
[1:22:46] with it as they want we are very blessed
[1:22:50] for 21 years we have rented the
[1:22:53] apartment it is an amazing place it has
[1:22:57] been a great blessing to brother Benny
[1:23:00] Friedman and his wife and children as
[1:23:03] they have lived in it now for quite a
[1:23:05] few years and it was important that we
[1:23:08] have someone in it because there was a
[1:23:10] break-in some years ago that was quite a
[1:23:13] hassle and we used to have two
[1:23:15] apartments and then we went down to one
[1:23:18] and I did receive official confirmation
[1:23:21] this morning hadn't had it been praying
[1:23:23] just believing the Lord but I had asked
[1:23:26] Benny to start looking for a new place
[1:23:28] because I cannot feel as I've prayed
[1:23:32] that that it's time to to move out of of
[1:23:35] Jerusalem I believe it's time to move in
[1:23:37] and that there are greater things ahead
[1:23:40] for us so we are going to be looking for
[1:23:43] an apartment we're going to be believing
[1:23:46] that greater days are ahead for the work
[1:23:48] in Jerusalem we want to thank every one
[1:23:51] of you for your faithful prayers and
[1:23:53] your unbelievable sacrificial giving
[1:23:56] through the years we've had some tough
[1:23:59] times but I had a beautiful letter from
[1:24:02] the owners of these apartments Thanking
[1:24:04] us for all of the years now you might
[1:24:07] say well you just about paid for one in
[1:24:11] 21 years I wish that were the case
[1:24:15] but the apartment is it sold for over a
[1:24:18] million dollars
[1:24:19] and we won't know the exact amount real
[1:24:22] estate has gone up up up in Jerusalem
[1:24:26] and apartments like the one we have are
[1:24:29] unheard of you don't find a three-level
[1:24:32] apartment like we have in a little
[1:24:34] hidden but beautiful place God gave it
[1:24:37] to us it served us it served many people
[1:24:41] around the world we had beautiful
[1:24:42] Services there we baptized many people
[1:24:45] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:47] because of the ministry sister Nancy
[1:24:50] served us so well there for many years
[1:24:52] but it's a new beginning
[1:24:55] God giving us a new beginning so we have
[1:24:58] to have a new place
[1:24:59] they are going to honor the lease till
[1:25:01] the 28th day of February which is a
[1:25:04] tremendous relief to us
[1:25:07] because we have you would not believe
[1:25:10] only you that have been there would
[1:25:12] believe the amount of stuff that's in
[1:25:14] the apartment I inherited everything
[1:25:16] that sister Nancy owned we gave her
[1:25:19] clothes away we gave a lot of her
[1:25:21] personal items away when she passed but
[1:25:24] but books and computers and office
[1:25:27] equipment chairs for about 75 people
[1:25:30] Pulpit keyboard set up for a church
[1:25:34] everything and so we either need a a
[1:25:39] great storage place which is a little
[1:25:41] iffy or we need an apartment between now
[1:25:45] and then would you pray that God will
[1:25:49] lead us do you know how hard it is to
[1:25:51] tend to that kind of business on the
[1:25:53] other side of the world so guess what
[1:25:56] that means I get to go
[1:25:59] but we don't know when in fact several
[1:26:02] of us may get to go because we may have
[1:26:04] to make some trips and I can't lift all
[1:26:07] that stuff
[1:26:09] so we're going to have to have some help
[1:26:11] lifting it
[1:26:12] uh I don't even want to think about
[1:26:15] what's all there there's beds to sleep
[1:26:17] we probably have beds to sleep 30 people
[1:26:20] stored in the basement
[1:26:22] I mean it's a camp we have just about
[1:26:24] everything two apartments two three
[1:26:27] level Apartments full of stuff
[1:26:29] and uh so anyway
[1:26:32] uh I had a piece come over me even
[1:26:34] though I didn't want to talk about it
[1:26:36] I had a peace come over me that it's a
[1:26:39] new beginning
[1:26:40] and God has it I just want to see a hand
[1:26:44] of commitment that you will help me pray
[1:26:46] and you'll get you'll just believe that
[1:26:49] God Will Make A Way because we believe
[1:26:51] that this message must be preached in
[1:26:55] Jerusalem as a sign of the end of the
[1:26:58] end
[1:26:58] we believe it
[1:27:00] we believe it how that looks what that
[1:27:03] looks like I have no idea that was some
[1:27:06] sad news but hopeful news now I want you
[1:27:10] all to look at me carefully
[1:27:14] anyone out there in the hallway
[1:27:17] anybody in the nurseries
[1:27:20] I'd like to see every face of every
[1:27:23] person that's here can you ask them to
[1:27:24] come out
[1:27:27] this is strange day isn't it
[1:27:30] I had no intention of announcing this
[1:27:33] today but I just felt like the lord gave
[1:27:36] me the permission as I was sitting there
[1:27:37] the nudge no one's in trouble
[1:27:42] that sounds terrible when you start
[1:27:43] clearing the bathrooms and the nurseries
[1:27:45] and
[1:27:48] I just want you to hear it face I want
[1:27:50] to see you
[1:27:51] when you hear
[1:27:53] what I have to say
[1:27:56] brother Greely knows
[1:28:01] Hallelujah
[1:28:03] Luke is the men's bathroom empty charity
[1:28:06] is the lady's bathroom empty drag them
[1:28:08] out
[1:28:10] [Music]
[1:28:12] this is big news
[1:28:17] and guess what I'm not even turning off
[1:28:19] the Stream
[1:28:23] who's coming they're coming in come in I
[1:28:27] want to see your faces
[1:28:30] should I be saying it nicer please let
[1:28:34] me see y'all's face
[1:28:40] everybody in now
[1:28:43] I heard brother Greeley announce what I
[1:28:47] had given him to announce
[1:28:50] you have given 324
[1:28:54] 000
[1:28:56] 93.62 from March of 2020 uh one March of
[1:29:03] 2021
[1:29:05] to July 22nd of 23.
[1:29:11] 324
[1:29:13] 093.62 that is quite a gift
[1:29:18] and some of you made great sacrifices
[1:29:21] I also heard brother Greely announce
[1:29:24] that as of today we owe on the loan now
[1:29:28] this isn't the payoff
[1:29:30] but when I looked at the payoff this
[1:29:32] week you know that changes almost daily
[1:29:34] but when I looked at the payoff this
[1:29:37] week it was actually a dollar or two
[1:29:39] less than what it says we owed on the
[1:29:42] payment
[1:29:42] so that's good if it'll stay like that
[1:29:45] we'll be glad so I heard brother Greely
[1:29:47] announce
[1:29:48] that we owed 142
[1:29:54] 000. can you all put that on the screen
[1:29:56] I want people to see what that looks
[1:29:59] like can we do that is anybody having
[1:30:01] fun yet
[1:30:07] brother and sister man I'm so sorry that
[1:30:09] that it's like this today David your son
[1:30:12] is here he will think we're just crazy
[1:30:15] I'm sorry Junior
[1:30:20] 140 to 701
[1:30:25] 142
[1:30:27] 701 dollars
[1:30:33] okay I'm with you I'm waiting on you I'm
[1:30:35] not going anywhere I've got another two
[1:30:37] hours here
[1:30:40] 701 67.
[1:30:43] what's that I'll wait till it updates
[1:30:52] you'll you'll at least say I've never
[1:30:53] been to another church like this one
[1:30:59] I heard brother Greeley say because
[1:31:01] that's what I put on his paper
[1:31:04] 104 I wrote this today
[1:31:07] 142 dollars oh no
[1:31:11] one hundred and forty two thousand seven
[1:31:14] hundred one dollars and sixty seven
[1:31:15] cents how many of you know we're
[1:31:16] believing to pay every bit of that off
[1:31:18] by the end of the year
[1:31:20] that's a lot of money
[1:31:22] for anybody
[1:31:24] for anybody
[1:31:26] we're believing God
[1:31:28] it looks a little scary when we look at
[1:31:30] that number right
[1:31:33] but God said 2023 is going to be a
[1:31:38] Supernatural year so God's going to do
[1:31:41] Supernatural things
[1:31:47] now we haven't paid this has not gone on
[1:31:50] yet because I we need another day for
[1:31:53] the for the money to clear the check to
[1:31:55] clear
[1:31:56] and so this hasn't gone to the bank yet
[1:31:58] and I wanted to wait until it had gone
[1:32:01] to the bank and everything and I could
[1:32:04] come and give you the updated balance
[1:32:06] and not even announce it we've known
[1:32:08] this for two weeks now boy it's been
[1:32:10] hard to not to tell you whoa
[1:32:13] but can I tell you that God
[1:32:16] in an unexpected way
[1:32:19] has provided an additional
[1:32:22] one hundred thousand dollars

[1:37:46] he made the way
[1:37:49] and the only other thing I'm going to
[1:37:52] say is that we have friends around the
[1:37:54] world
[1:37:55] who love this place
[1:37:57] and who want it to be all that God has
[1:38:00] created it to be and so do you
[1:38:04] and so God has provided and that's all
[1:38:07] we need to know is that he is faithful
[1:38:10] and he will be faithful but I can
[1:38:13] honestly say that it's a lot one more
[1:38:16] time let me see it charity did you take
[1:38:18] it away one more time let me look at
[1:38:20] that that looks did you ever think that
[1:38:23] 42 000 would look small
[1:38:29] it looks so tiny
[1:38:32] God is so good let's thank God for the
[1:38:35] musicians
[1:38:44] John chapter 1.
[1:38:47] beginning in verse 1 through verse 14.
[1:38:52] in the beginning
[1:38:55] was the word
[1:38:58] and the word
[1:39:01] was with God
[1:39:04] and the word
[1:39:06] was God in the beginning
[1:39:10] there was
[1:39:12] the word
[1:39:14] and the word
[1:39:16] was with God
[1:39:19] and the word
[1:39:21] was God it's powerful
[1:39:25] it's beautiful
[1:39:26] it's mysterious
[1:39:28] until
[1:39:30] the Revelation comes
[1:39:33] now the next verse the same
[1:39:37] the word
[1:39:38] was in the beginning
[1:39:41] with God
[1:39:43] all things
[1:39:45] were made by him
[1:39:48] and without him was not anything made
[1:39:52] that was made
[1:39:54] can you say Amen in him God and the word
[1:39:58] now they're one now they're one
[1:40:00] so we can say in God was life or we
[1:40:03] could say in the word was life because
[1:40:07] we're now told they're one
[1:40:10] in him the word was life and the life
[1:40:14] was the light of men
[1:40:18] what was the light of men both God
[1:40:22] and the word in him was life and the
[1:40:25] life was the light of men let's go on
[1:40:27] and the light shineth in darkness
[1:40:32] and the Darkness
[1:40:34] comprehended it not
[1:40:37] there was a man sent from God whose name
[1:40:41] was John
[1:40:44] the same came for a witness
[1:40:47] to Bear witness of the light
[1:40:51] that all men through him not not John
[1:40:58] but the light
[1:41:00] John was a witness of the light and many
[1:41:04] would believe in the light because of
[1:41:06] John
[1:41:08] that all men through him might believe
[1:41:10] so can we say that God must have made
[1:41:14] John a light
[1:41:16] to reflect the light
[1:41:19] so that all could see the light
[1:41:22] beautiful really
[1:41:24] there the same came for a witness to
[1:41:26] Bear witness of the light that all men
[1:41:29] through him might believe
[1:41:32] he was not
[1:41:34] that light
[1:41:36] but was sent to Bear witness of
[1:41:40] that light remember that light was God
[1:41:43] that light was the word John was not
[1:41:46] that light but as the moon reflects not
[1:41:51] its own light but the light of the sun
[1:41:53] John was like the Moon
[1:41:56] he was like a mirror
[1:41:58] and when that light shined on John John
[1:42:02] reflected that light if you saw John you
[1:42:05] would have seen the light
[1:42:07] if you would have met John you would
[1:42:09] have met the light
[1:42:11] because the light was emanating from
[1:42:14] John though he was not that light
[1:42:17] he was sent to Bear witness of that
[1:42:19] light you follow that let's go on that
[1:42:22] that that was the True Light
[1:42:26] which lighteth every man that cometh
[1:42:29] into the world
[1:42:32] he was in the world
[1:42:35] and the word
[1:42:37] he was in the word he the word was in
[1:42:40] the world
[1:42:41] and the world was made by him
[1:42:44] and the world knew him not
[1:42:47] because we know that our lord Jesus was
[1:42:50] the word made flesh
[1:42:52] he was in the world Jesus the word was
[1:42:55] in the world and the world was made by
[1:42:58] Jesus the word god
[1:43:01] and the world knew him not how is it
[1:43:06] that he created the world and the world
[1:43:08] didn't even recognize its creator
[1:43:11] that was because of religious men
[1:43:15] who already had an idea of what he would
[1:43:18] look like when he came
[1:43:20] and when he came he didn't look like
[1:43:22] they thought he would look
[1:43:25] you bear a sword like a zealot and try
[1:43:28] to rid Israel of the Roman occupation
[1:43:32] and so because man had produced this
[1:43:35] thought of how the Messiah would look
[1:43:38] when he came he came and they didn't
[1:43:40] even know who he was
[1:43:42] because preachers rabbis had presented
[1:43:46] their concept of what he would look like
[1:43:49] and it caused the people to miss him
[1:43:53] religious men still doing the same thing
[1:43:56] today
[1:43:56] [Applause]
[1:43:58] he came unto his
[1:44:00] own
[1:44:02] both the Jewish people and those of
[1:44:06] Adam's Fallen race
[1:44:07] and his own his own
[1:44:11] his own the ones he created
[1:44:14] the ones he had relation with
[1:44:17] the ones who he would become a Kinsmen
[1:44:20] Redeemer for and his own received him
[1:44:23] not but as many here I am here I am here
[1:44:29] you are but as many as received him to
[1:44:32] them death not to those look The Light
[1:44:36] Came to light the path for every man
[1:44:40] The Light Came To Shine on every man but
[1:44:43] as many as received him to them
[1:44:46] gave he the power
[1:44:48] to become the sons of God many received
[1:44:51] the benefit of the light being in the
[1:44:55] Earth
[1:44:56] healed
[1:44:57] Miracles fish sandwiches
[1:45:02] bills paid because of him but as many as
[1:45:06] received him to them gave him power to
[1:45:10] become the sons of God not just to
[1:45:12] everyone who amend him
[1:45:14] or who benefited from his coming but to
[1:45:17] those who received him to receive him is
[1:45:21] to give up
[1:45:24] to receive him is to give up
[1:45:27] your own rights
[1:45:29] your own will and surrender to his but
[1:45:34] as many as received him to them gave him
[1:45:37] power to become the sons of God even to
[1:45:41] them that believe on his name which were
[1:45:45] born not of blood nor of the will of the
[1:45:48] flesh nor of the will of man but
[1:45:52] of God all right now and the word
[1:45:58] verse 14 and the word
[1:46:01] remember the word was with God in the
[1:46:04] beginning and the word
[1:46:05] was God and the Word was made flesh no
[1:46:10] Trinity here
[1:46:11] no three persons of the godhead here the
[1:46:15] god the word that was one one
[1:46:19] was made flesh one
[1:46:22] and dwelt Among Us
[1:46:24] and we beheld his glory you're not
[1:46:28] replacing the father you're not putting
[1:46:31] the father out you're not dishonoring
[1:46:33] the father when you receive him
[1:46:37] you've received the father didn't Jesus
[1:46:40] say when you have
[1:46:42] seen me
[1:46:43] you have
[1:46:45] because I'm here to Bear witness of him
[1:46:48] when you've seen me
[1:46:50] you've seen the father
[1:46:55] John could have said when you've seen me
[1:46:59] you've seen the father
[1:47:02] because he was made one with the word
[1:47:05] is that right and the Word was made
[1:47:07] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[1:47:10] his glory the glory as of the only
[1:47:12] begotten of the father full of grace and
[1:47:15] truth father we need you today
[1:47:18] we've been on a roller coaster this
[1:47:20] morning we've had some serious things to
[1:47:23] think about contemplate and pray about
[1:47:25] and then we had a climax like no other
[1:47:30] that you have miraculously reduced
[1:47:34] [Music]
[1:47:35] graciously generously reduced
[1:47:38] that big mountain that was in front of
[1:47:41] us
[1:47:42] and we started praising you in the first
[1:47:44] grain of sand rolled off
[1:47:46] we didn't wait until there were big
[1:47:48] checks
[1:47:49] we started praising you in the first
[1:47:51] grain of sand rolled off that mountain
[1:47:54] in your name we gave you praise we
[1:47:56] jumped we dance we Rejoice we shouted
[1:47:59] and we gave you the glory and so until
[1:48:02] the end of this we will do the same
[1:48:04] yours is the glory help us now during
[1:48:08] this time in your word in the precious
[1:48:11] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[1:48:13] amen
[1:48:15] you may be seated thank you to all of
[1:48:18] you who are rejoicing with us
[1:48:21] streaming this service many many
[1:48:24] and and telling us where you're from
[1:48:27] thank you thank you we will go back and
[1:48:29] see every one of those comments
[1:48:32] I want to go to questions and answers
[1:48:34] number two
[1:48:41] and we're already 15 minutes to one
[1:48:45] and so we're going to have to have a
[1:48:48] slightly abbreviated version of this
[1:48:50] this morning but if you will pull we'll
[1:48:54] get to where we need to be by God's
[1:48:56] grace
[1:48:57] now in paragraph 106 he said the pillar
[1:49:01] of fire is the anointing
[1:49:04] did you know when you are calling for
[1:49:06] the anointing to come you are calling on
[1:49:09] the pillar of Fire
[1:49:11] isn't that great
[1:49:12] now now what do we know about that
[1:49:14] Pillar of Fire we know that that Pillar
[1:49:16] of Fire is what led the didn't we just
[1:49:18] do this a few weeks ago when different
[1:49:20] ones were reading scriptures and they
[1:49:23] told us how that Pillar of Fire would
[1:49:26] lead the children of Israel by day and a
[1:49:29] pillar of cloud by night I mean Cloud by
[1:49:34] day Fire by night we got it
[1:49:36] didn't we read how that when the enemy
[1:49:40] was approaching that fire before them
[1:49:42] removed itself
[1:49:45] came around behind them and blocked the
[1:49:48] enemy that that manifestation whether it
[1:49:51] was fire or whether it was Cloud it it
[1:49:54] provided protection for them and and and
[1:49:59] don't we understand that
[1:50:02] as Believers of this end time truth that
[1:50:06] God allowed that same Pillar of Fire to
[1:50:09] come down at Shavuot in the upper room
[1:50:13] and divide itself one great
[1:50:17] manifestation of God now divided into
[1:50:20] individual little licks of fire
[1:50:23] appearing over their head and that same
[1:50:27] light I want to say this again it
[1:50:30] divided itself
[1:50:32] you see God is in the multiplying and
[1:50:35] dividing business
[1:50:37] he both multiplies and he divides
[1:50:42] and so on that day he both multiplied
[1:50:46] and he divided he divided himself
[1:50:51] because he was that light he was that
[1:50:54] fire he was that cloud amen same
[1:50:59] manifestation the Bible is clear that
[1:51:01] was God that wasn't a an object lesson
[1:51:06] that wasn't just a symbol it was a
[1:51:09] manifestation of God so if the pillar of
[1:51:14] fire is the anointing and the pillar of
[1:51:18] fire is a manifestation of God I want
[1:51:21] you to understand that when the
[1:51:23] anointing comes
[1:51:25] he comes like a person
[1:51:28] not a Feeling
[1:51:30] but he comes as a manifestation of God
[1:51:34] are you awake
[1:51:36] are you with me I need you to be with me
[1:51:38] this morning so the pillar of fire is
[1:51:41] the anointing if the pillar of fire is a
[1:51:44] manifestation of God did you know the
[1:51:47] anointing
[1:51:48] is also a manifestation of God not a
[1:51:52] Feeling
[1:51:54] it's really God showing up in the house
[1:51:57] you can take a song and and it'd be a
[1:52:00] lovely song a nice song but when the
[1:52:04] anointing comes in that Psalm God oh
[1:52:09] God is manifesting himself in that song
[1:52:14] and through that song
[1:52:17] have you ever had God show up in your
[1:52:19] conversation
[1:52:21] you're just having a good bible
[1:52:22] discussion and he comes the anointing
[1:52:27] come you may not see the pillar of fire
[1:52:29] but the pillar of fire is the anointing
[1:52:33] and the pillar of fire is a
[1:52:35] manifestation of God
[1:52:37] amen
[1:52:39] and uh
[1:52:43] so are you
[1:52:47] because you are a word
[1:52:51] sent from God
[1:52:53] and the Bible said that God is very very
[1:52:57] particular about his word
[1:53:00] and not any of his word none of it will
[1:53:04] return to him void
[1:53:07] and what that means is it will not
[1:53:10] return to him not having accomplished
[1:53:14] all that he sent it to accomplish
[1:53:18] that includes you
[1:53:20] you must see yourself as a part of that
[1:53:25] word
[1:53:27] a part of that fire a part of that
[1:53:30] anointing so I want to I want to
[1:53:33] summarize Again by by reading this
[1:53:37] sentence
[1:53:38] the pillar of fire is the anointing
[1:53:43] now when you're Sway and and sister
[1:53:47] uh Jaya we're getting ready to sing I
[1:53:50] said bless them Lord
[1:53:52] anoint them Lord
[1:53:56] what am I asking I'm asking for God to
[1:53:58] manifest himself
[1:54:00] to them
[1:54:02] so that he can manifest himself
[1:54:06] through them you're saying Lord let the
[1:54:09] pillar of fire fall on them
[1:54:12] but you're also saying let the pillar of
[1:54:15] fire rise in them
[1:54:18] because the anointing doesn't just fall
[1:54:20] on us
[1:54:21] we are the anointed did you know
[1:54:24] anything that the anointing falls on it
[1:54:26] becomes anointed of God
[1:54:29] did you know on that day excuse me did
[1:54:32] you know on that day that the pillar of
[1:54:34] fire fell on the mountain it shows an
[1:54:37] ordinary bush
[1:54:39] there was nothing particular about that
[1:54:42] bush
[1:54:44] it wasn't a glorious Bush it wasn't
[1:54:47] necessarily a beautiful bush
[1:54:50] we don't even know the Botanical genre
[1:54:52] of that bush we don't know the Latin
[1:54:55] name of that bush
[1:54:58] somebody said well I got a burning bush
[1:55:00] in my yard well good for you that's what
[1:55:02] someone has called it but we don't know
[1:55:04] if we don't know the the Bush was not
[1:55:07] the important part
[1:55:11] that Bush was just a bush just about I
[1:55:15] feel like preaching and I only feel like
[1:55:16] about half of you feel like listening
[1:55:20] that is dangerous combo
[1:55:22] because I feel like preaching and only
[1:55:25] about half of you feel like listening I
[1:55:27] don't know where this thing will get to
[1:55:30] just a bush I want you all to see it Mr
[1:55:34] Bush
[1:55:37] not a pretty bush
[1:55:39] necessarily might have been might have
[1:55:41] been beautiful
[1:55:42] nobody said anything it wasn't beautiful
[1:55:45] enough for Moses to tell about how
[1:55:47] beautiful it was till the fire hit it
[1:55:51] it was not a holy Bush I'll tell you
[1:55:54] that
[1:55:55] Mr Bush
[1:55:56] and one day God come down on the
[1:55:58] mountain and he said I got to talk to my
[1:56:00] prophet
[1:56:01] so I'm gonna crawl
[1:56:04] inside of a bush
[1:56:08] and God doesn't do things all uh you
[1:56:10] know just totally random
[1:56:12] so he looked down among the bushes
[1:56:15] and he found a bush if I know anything
[1:56:17] about God's character he chose the
[1:56:20] lowliest bush
[1:56:22] [Applause]
[1:56:25] he chose Bethlehem
[1:56:29] he chose to make him a Galilean
[1:56:32] he chose Shepherds to sing about his
[1:56:35] birth
[1:56:36] to go tell the good news about his verse
[1:56:38] why it had to be Shepherds
[1:56:41] so if I know anything about the
[1:56:43] character of God he didn't say let me
[1:56:45] look down here and see the most amazing
[1:56:48] Bush I can use it it was more or less
[1:56:50] most likely that it was just a scrub
[1:56:56] God said that one will do
[1:56:59] because he was not nearly as concerned
[1:57:02] about that bush before
[1:57:10] it didn't really matter what it was
[1:57:14] five seconds before
[1:57:17] when God crawled into that bush and it
[1:57:21] began to burn with a fire and the fire
[1:57:24] could not consume the bush
[1:57:27] God protected the bush
[1:57:30] so that he preserved the bush so that it
[1:57:34] burnt but was not yet consumed
[1:57:39] we don't know if the bush actually
[1:57:41] looked any different
[1:57:45] when the fire of God moved out
[1:57:50] we don't know if it was scorched we
[1:57:52] don't know if it was singed
[1:57:55] we don't know if his growth was stunted
[1:57:57] we don't even know that in 50 years
[1:57:59] Moses came back up on that mountain if
[1:58:02] he could even found the bush
[1:58:04] we're not told the Bush was given
[1:58:06] eternal life
[1:58:11] so when was that bush most important
[1:58:15] when God was in the bush
[1:58:17] when the fire was on the bush
[1:58:20] was the bush holy before the fire or
[1:58:23] after the fire
[1:58:24] it was holy when the fire came
[1:58:27] [Applause]
[1:58:30] if we were denominationally minded we
[1:58:32] would say as soon as the fire left the
[1:58:35] Bush was still holy and we would build a
[1:58:37] shrine
[1:58:39] and we would paint a picture of it and
[1:58:41] we would make an icon in the Church of
[1:58:43] it and we would have people do the sign
[1:58:45] of the cross when they passed the
[1:58:47] picture of the Bush because we like to
[1:58:50] put the holy
[1:58:52] in common things
[1:58:54] and make them big things
[1:58:58] and we do that with religious intent and
[1:59:02] not sincere hearts
[1:59:04] so I don't know what the bush looked
[1:59:05] like after but I want you to know as
[1:59:07] long as the fire of God was on that bush
[1:59:10] an ordinary Bush was made into a holy
[1:59:13] bush
[1:59:14] and as long as you and I have the very
[1:59:17] life of God inside of us
[1:59:20] [Applause]
[1:59:23] doesn't matter what we were five seconds
[1:59:25] before he came
[1:59:28] [Music]
[1:59:30] when he puts himself in US
[1:59:32] we become a holy bush
[1:59:36] we become a holy people
[1:59:42] well we gotta go
[1:59:45] the pillar of fire is the anointing
[1:59:47] paragraph 107. now that Pillar of Fire
[1:59:52] is
[1:59:55] the logos
[1:59:57] that went out of God
[2:00:05] the prophet talks about in the original
[2:00:09] how that there was a great big Fountain
[2:00:11] of Light
[2:00:13] and out of that Fountain of Light
[2:00:16] came the logos
[2:00:20] that logos came from that light
[2:00:24] that light was the word
[2:00:28] that light was God it would become God
[2:00:31] right
[2:00:33] so the pillar of fire is the logos
[2:00:39] which doesn't have a body of its own
[2:00:43] that went out of God so when you have
[2:00:47] the anointing
[2:00:48] that's the logos of God that's that
[2:00:51] Spirit Light life that went out you have
[2:00:56] a part of that in you that Pillar of
[2:00:59] Fire is the logos that went out of God
[2:01:01] when you are anointed you are anointed
[2:01:03] with that logos which is a manifestation
[2:01:07] or you might call it a demonstration of
[2:01:09] who God is
[2:01:11] the logos which is actually the
[2:01:14] attribute
[2:01:17] of the fullness of God
[2:01:19] we might add without a body
[2:01:24] because when the fullness of God the
[2:01:26] logos
[2:01:27] was made flesh
[2:01:31] when it was given a body
[2:01:33] the Bible said in him
[2:01:36] dwelt the
[2:01:39] fullness of
[2:01:41] the godhead bodily
[2:01:46] so in Jesus was father
[2:01:49] and Jesus was son and Jesus was Holy
[2:01:54] Ghost the Bible tells us in him dwelt
[2:01:58] the fullness not one of the attributes
[2:02:01] not one of the offices
[2:02:05] not one of the personalities
[2:02:08] all of God all of God in Jesus in him
[2:02:13] was the fullness of the godhead bodily
[2:02:16] someone give us that scripture reference
[2:02:18] and let us read let us tell it out in
[2:02:21] case someone is watching this service
[2:02:23] and not familiar with that verse of
[2:02:25] scripture in him uh throughout the
[2:02:27] fullness of the godhead bodily so we can
[2:02:30] give that because there may be someone
[2:02:31] watching this who's never heard that
[2:02:34] verse of scripture like that and you
[2:02:36] might want to go back and read it for
[2:02:38] yourself who can give me the address
[2:02:41] Colossians
[2:02:43] 2 9
[2:02:45] Colossians 2 9. all right let's go on
[2:02:51] now that Pillar of Fire is the logos
[2:02:54] that went out of God paragraph 107. the
[2:02:58] logos which is actually the attribute of
[2:03:03] the fullness of God when God become into
[2:03:07] a form now that's unusual wording there
[2:03:10] we can leave off the bee
[2:03:12] and we can say came instead of come and
[2:03:16] we can say when God came into a form to
[2:03:21] where it could be seen you follow that
[2:03:24] it was the anointing of the great spirit
[2:03:28] we're not talking about the Native
[2:03:30] American great spirit unless the Native
[2:03:33] American is talking about God
[2:03:35] Our God the one true Living God we're
[2:03:38] talking about the great spirit being the
[2:03:41] eternal spirit of the father it was the
[2:03:43] anointing of that great spirit that went
[2:03:46] forth it's condescending coming down God
[2:03:50] the Father the logos that was up over
[2:03:53] Israel he was holy could not bear sin
[2:03:57] are you still with me there had to be a
[2:04:01] blood offering right in Eden
[2:04:04] remember some Lambs had to die to cover
[2:04:07] the nakedness of Adam and Eve right so
[2:04:10] there was a blood offering there and
[2:04:12] then also Abel had a blood offering
[2:04:15] there God had the first Blood offering
[2:04:17] Abel had the next blood offering then
[2:04:20] the logos became flesh
[2:04:23] and dwelt Among Us
[2:04:25] that's John 1 14.
[2:04:29] and where this logos dwelt in a human
[2:04:33] body which was the sacrifice
[2:04:36] when man was made in the image of God
[2:04:39] and then God came down in the image of
[2:04:42] man to redeem man beautiful that you got
[2:04:46] to read that that
[2:04:49] and god let's do it again together that
[2:04:53] brought man and God together what
[2:04:56] brought man and God together when God
[2:04:58] came down in the image of a man when the
[2:05:01] logos became flesh when the word became
[2:05:04] flesh Heaven and Earth heavens and earth
[2:05:08] hugged
[2:05:11] and kissed each other
[2:05:13] big sloppy wet kisses
[2:05:16] when Heavens came down and Earth and
[2:05:19] hugged each other when God became banned
[2:05:23] when the Heavenly broke forth into the
[2:05:26] Earthly when eternity stepped into time
[2:05:30] come on God and man embraced each other
[2:05:35] as fatherhood and sonship no eternal
[2:05:39] sonship
[2:05:40] Jesus was an eternal part of who God is
[2:05:43] but he was not an eternal son
[2:05:46] there's no such thing as an eternal son
[2:05:49] you can't always be a son
[2:05:56] there has to be a begetting
[2:05:59] there has to be a birth there has to be
[2:06:02] a creating
[2:06:03] so yes Jesus was is the son of God
[2:06:09] was eternal in the sense that he was the
[2:06:12] image of God
[2:06:14] the express image of God correct but as
[2:06:18] a son he was not Eternal do you follow
[2:06:20] that there was a time and brother random
[2:06:22] was telling us when that time was When
[2:06:24] Heaven and Earth hugged and kissed each
[2:06:26] other when God became a baby in a Manger
[2:06:30] There It Is God and man embraced each
[2:06:32] other as fatherhood and sonship when the
[2:06:34] logos became flesh and dwelt Among Us oh
[2:06:39] my goodness what kind of a God we serve
[2:06:41] I want you to help me now what kind of a
[2:06:44] god do we serve did he come down he
[2:06:46] loved us so much that he stripped
[2:06:48] himself of the royal Robes of Eternity
[2:06:51] and said I'm going to Dawn the Robes of
[2:06:52] an Earthly Fallen man just a man of
[2:06:55] Flesh just a man of passion just a man
[2:06:57] of emotion
[2:06:59] but I'm gonna do that
[2:07:01] Son of God is going to become a son of
[2:07:05] man that the Fallen sons of men might
[2:07:08] become
[2:07:09] the sons of God
[2:07:11] Jesus said paragraph 109 I came from God
[2:07:15] and I go to God is that right
[2:07:18] after his death burial resurrection and
[2:07:20] Ascension when the body was taken up to
[2:07:23] sit at the right hand of God now I don't
[2:07:25] mean God's got a right hand God's a
[2:07:27] spirit remember the right hand of God is
[2:07:29] a place of power and authority it's a
[2:07:32] symbolic place the right arm of God the
[2:07:35] right hand of God that's where Jesus is
[2:07:38] all right but at the right hand means in
[2:07:40] power and authority of God that in that
[2:07:43] name
[2:07:45] what name Jesus
[2:07:48] Yeshua
[2:07:49] that in that name everything in heaven
[2:07:52] is named after it the Bible tells us the
[2:07:55] whole family of Heaven is named after
[2:07:56] him
[2:07:59] so why in the world would you want to be
[2:08:01] baptized in a title of father
[2:08:04] when the father has taken on a name
[2:08:08] why would you want to be baptized in the
[2:08:10] name of a son which is not a name at all
[2:08:12] when the son has taken on a name why
[2:08:15] would you want to be baptized in the
[2:08:16] title of the Holy Ghost when the Holy
[2:08:18] Ghost has taken on a name the whole
[2:08:20] family of God is named after him
[2:08:26] ice cream
[2:08:28] you included
[2:08:31] if you've gone down in a watery grave
[2:08:33] Hallelujah
[2:08:35] you came up Mrs Jesus Christ
[2:08:38] you go down in the titles of Father Son
[2:08:41] and Holy Ghost you come up a confused
[2:08:42] sinner
[2:08:46] there's only one thing that can
[2:08:47] transform you and it's not water
[2:08:49] it's the blood and you've got to be able
[2:08:52] to identify where the blood came from it
[2:08:55] doesn't come from father
[2:08:57] it was created and it's named Jesus
[2:08:59] Christ
[2:09:00] even the blood has a name
[2:09:04] even the word has a name
[2:09:07] isn't that good
[2:09:08] that in the name that in that name
[2:09:10] everything in heaven is named after and
[2:09:12] subject to it everything in Earth is
[2:09:14] named after it and subject to it a name
[2:09:16] above all names
[2:09:18] and we know that name is Jesus Christ
[2:09:21] we're not ashamed of that we're thankful
[2:09:23] very very very thankful right
[2:09:26] now the logos that was in him
[2:09:30] which was the spirit of God the
[2:09:32] anointing
[2:09:33] through the sanctifying grace of the
[2:09:37] blood
[2:09:38] brought many sons to God
[2:09:41] and let me tell you something about
[2:09:42] those sons of God they are anointed
[2:09:49] oh yes
[2:09:51] with the same
[2:09:54] logos
[2:09:57] same Pillar of Fire
[2:09:59] same anointing
[2:10:01] same logos same God
[2:10:05] this Holy Ghost In You
[2:10:08] is God
[2:10:10] he said so the word teaches us it's not
[2:10:14] a watered-down version
[2:10:16] it's not a piece of apportion it's him
[2:10:19] Amen in the message the seed shall not
[2:10:22] be aired with the shut paragraph 32
[2:10:25] thank you for staying with me I will
[2:10:27] never get to the text
[2:10:29] this morning but we'll get a good
[2:10:30] foundation and be ready for it when we
[2:10:32] come back you
[2:10:40] he wasn't even God
[2:10:42] is an object of worship now this throws
[2:10:45] people
[2:10:46] because brother Branham is trying to
[2:10:48] make a point that in order for God to be
[2:10:50] God there had to be a creation to
[2:10:53] worship him well that to me makes a
[2:10:55] whole lot of sense and God quickly took
[2:10:58] care of the problem but before he was
[2:11:00] God and in the sense that there was
[2:11:03] something created to worship him you
[2:11:05] were not the first thing created to
[2:11:06] worship God he created angels in the
[2:11:09] Heavenly Host to worship him before he
[2:11:12] had a people or a creation that could
[2:11:14] worship him he was logos
[2:11:18] he was the word
[2:11:20] he was God
[2:11:22] but not worshiped as God so don't let
[2:11:25] that throw you in any shape form or
[2:11:27] fashion and the logos logos we call it
[2:11:30] the word that went out of God that
[2:11:33] anyone knows that that was the what
[2:11:38] that was the angel of the Lord
[2:11:42] so now we have the anointing is the
[2:11:46] logos
[2:11:49] the pillar of fire is the anointing
[2:11:53] powerful all the same different
[2:11:56] manifestations of The Same Spirit
[2:11:58] and now we learn that the logos was that
[2:12:03] word that went out of God
[2:12:05] that was the angel of the Lord
[2:12:10] so the angel of the Lord is the logos
[2:12:13] the angel of the Lord is the anointing
[2:12:17] the angel of the Lord is the word that
[2:12:19] went out from God isn't that right
[2:12:22] we're pulling it all together right
[2:12:25] don't don't don't get confused it's just
[2:12:29] how many spirits of the Lord are there
[2:12:33] different manifestations according to
[2:12:35] Isaiah 11 2. but the same God the same
[2:12:38] Spirit of the Lord it all falls under
[2:12:41] the category even the spirit of wisdom
[2:12:43] and the spirit of mind the spirit of
[2:12:44] counsel all those mentioned in Isaiah 11
[2:12:46] do they all fall under the cat of the
[2:12:48] fear of the Lord all that falls under
[2:12:50] the category of the spirit of the Lord
[2:12:52] so these other things are not different
[2:12:54] Spirits even though the Bible refers to
[2:12:56] them as the seven spirits of God they're
[2:12:58] all a part of the spirit of the Lord
[2:13:02] together for us and he's saying that was
[2:13:05] also the angel of the Lord or the word
[2:13:07] of the Lord that followed the Israelites
[2:13:11] through the wilderness
[2:13:13] one generation ago there was a Ministry
[2:13:15] on the earth it couldn't do anything of
[2:13:17] itself
[2:13:19] had to wait on the angel of the Lord to
[2:13:21] show up
[2:13:23] correct he had to wait on the logos to
[2:13:26] come he had to wait on the pillar of
[2:13:28] fire to come
[2:13:29] he had to wait on the word of the Lord
[2:13:31] to come so he said you know I'm stalling
[2:13:34] I'm waiting on something I'm waiting on
[2:13:36] him who him who the angel of the Lord
[2:13:39] who is the Angel of the lord it's the
[2:13:41] low gods what is the low God says that
[2:13:44] which came forth out of that great
[2:13:45] Fountain of Light
[2:13:47] is it physical form or Spirit form it's
[2:13:50] Spirit form but it Longs for a body form
[2:13:54] that's why John 1 14 is so important and
[2:13:57] the word became flesh
[2:13:59] so we see that Jesus was the fullness of
[2:14:03] the godhead he was the manifestation of
[2:14:06] the logos in an Earthly body
[2:14:10] that was the angel of the Lord or the
[2:14:12] word of the Lord that followed the
[2:14:13] Israelites through the Wilderness there
[2:14:15] he is and then he calls him the angel of
[2:14:18] the Covenant and that takes us to
[2:14:19] revelation 10.
[2:14:22] and I saw another Mighty Angel come down
[2:14:24] from God out of Heaven come on put one
[2:14:26] foot on the land one on the sea declare
[2:14:27] that time would be no more the angel of
[2:14:29] the Covenant
[2:14:30] who is the Angel of the Covenant
[2:14:33] the logos the anointing the pillar of
[2:14:36] fire the angel of the Lord the word of
[2:14:39] God the Eternal Spirit of the Father the
[2:14:41] manifestation of the son
[2:14:43] the fullness of the Holy Ghost
[2:14:45] hero Israel
[2:14:50] somebody's sitting there or listening
[2:14:52] this
[2:14:55] this
[2:14:56] you got to be kidding me this is
[2:14:58] confusing no no no no no no no
[2:15:02] this is simplicity
[2:15:04] the church is confusing
[2:15:07] they've cut God up in so many pieces
[2:15:09] they'll never be able to pull him back
[2:15:11] together again
[2:15:12] we've seen what the word said he's one
[2:15:15] he's one somebody say he's one
[2:15:18] many offices many manifestations many
[2:15:21] demonstrations he can take on any form
[2:15:24] he chooses he can come in a body of
[2:15:27] Flesh like a man or he could come in a
[2:15:29] bush
[2:15:31] [Applause]
[2:15:32] but as long as God was in that bush that
[2:15:36] Bush was God
[2:15:37] [Applause]
[2:15:39] as long as that God was in that bush
[2:15:42] that Bush was deity
[2:15:47] oh come on
[2:15:51] you're getting it
[2:15:57] now I'm thankful for this I got to hurry
[2:15:59] I'm thankful for this he chose that bush
[2:16:02] for one afternoon
[2:16:05] he chose me for eternity
[2:16:07] [Applause]
[2:16:11] I'm not gonna crawl in and out and in
[2:16:13] and out and in and out and in and out
[2:16:15] and in and out of you
[2:16:18] I'm not just going to be God above you
[2:16:20] hanging like a pillar of fire I'm not
[2:16:22] just going to be Emmanuel God walking
[2:16:23] around with you in fleshly body of Jesus
[2:16:26] he said but I'm going to be God in you
[2:16:30] I'm gonna fill you with the Holy Ghost
[2:16:33] and Fire
[2:16:35] the pillar of fire is living in the
[2:16:38] bride
[2:16:44] job then brother Glory
[2:16:48] the angel of the Lord
[2:16:50] the word of the Lord the angel of the
[2:16:53] Covenant Lord Jesus Christ
[2:16:57] that that's confusing
[2:17:02] I'll tell you what's confusing
[2:17:04] father's the first person of the godhead
[2:17:06] the son is the second person of the God
[2:17:08] Hand the Holy Ghost is the third person
[2:17:10] of the godhead that's confusing
[2:17:14] because we know Jesus is not the second
[2:17:16] person of the godhead he's the only
[2:17:18] person of the godhead the other two
[2:17:20] manifestations are Spirit
[2:17:22] not persons
[2:17:26] um
[2:17:27] when did it start I don't want to go too
[2:17:29] far in this don't know who's watching
[2:17:32] but when did this whole cutting up the
[2:17:34] pie start 325 A.D at the Nicene Council
[2:17:38] [Music]
[2:17:39] the same day same time that they
[2:17:41] accepted pagan holiday Expressions
[2:17:43] called Christmas
[2:17:46] same counsel
[2:17:47] the same counsel that they replace the
[2:17:49] The Old Rugged Cross for a Christmas
[2:17:51] tree
[2:17:53] the same counsel same same ministers
[2:17:55] meeting
[2:17:57] 325 A.D read it change the baptism
[2:17:59] change the godhead because so many
[2:18:01] pagans were coming to the faith and they
[2:18:03] didn't want to ask them I'd ask them
[2:18:05] they didn't want to ask them to give up
[2:18:07] their gods
[2:18:09] because they were ignorant and thought
[2:18:10] that you could have the one true Living
[2:18:12] God while still kind of coddling all of
[2:18:14] these other uh familial Gods because
[2:18:17] they thought they were traditional and
[2:18:19] you can't take a man out of his
[2:18:20] tradition that's what they thought
[2:18:23] so they cuddled they cuddled they
[2:18:26] refused to stand so I want you to know
[2:18:28] that some of the early church fathers
[2:18:30] that everybody brags about makes them
[2:18:31] such amazing Heroes I want you to know
[2:18:33] that many of them were confused and they
[2:18:36] let the church into confusion and that's
[2:18:38] why there had to be a Word of Promise
[2:18:40] that said I will restore what the
[2:18:42] caterpillar and the Pummel worm and the
[2:18:44] canker worm hath eaten
[2:18:47] that's why the bride tree had to be
[2:18:49] restored
[2:18:51] Hallelujah I'm yelling a lot forgive me
[2:18:54] I'm a Yeller
[2:18:55] I didn't say I'm yellow
[2:18:57] I said I'm a Yeller
[2:19:01] that was Angel Lord the word of the Lord
[2:19:03] that followed the Israelites through the
[2:19:04] Wilderness the angel of the Covenant the
[2:19:05] logos that went out of God brother Ram
[2:19:07] just put it all together my God that's
[2:19:09] not confusing
[2:19:12] and then that logos was made flesh and
[2:19:14] dwelt among us and what was that that
[2:19:15] was the Lord Jesus Christ the son of God
[2:19:17] the manifestation of son but in that
[2:19:19] body throughout the fullness of the
[2:19:21] godhead bodily now we're in Saint John 1
[2:19:23] and I was we read it in the beginning
[2:19:25] was the word the word was with God the
[2:19:27] Word was God and now as he gave his life
[2:19:30] for us
[2:19:33] then his spirit
[2:19:35] comes back
[2:19:37] upon us
[2:19:41] I don't have all the verses in front of
[2:19:43] me this morning
[2:19:45] didn't know where I would go
[2:19:47] but remember Jesus said I will not leave
[2:19:49] you comfortless in one place he said
[2:19:51] I'll pray the father and he'll send you
[2:19:53] a comforter
[2:19:54] in another place he said I'll not leave
[2:19:56] you comfortless
[2:19:57] I will come to you
[2:20:00] why could he say that how could he say
[2:20:02] that how could he say I'll come to you
[2:20:04] because he did come
[2:20:06] the first time he came in body form
[2:20:09] the second time he came in spirit form
[2:20:11] same Jesus
[2:20:15] wonderful wonderful wonderful you see
[2:20:17] it's a multiplication
[2:20:19] That Old Devil had to deal with one
[2:20:20] Jesus until the day of Pentecost
[2:20:22] don't go crazy don't think I'm saying
[2:20:24] something blasphemous
[2:20:27] I I understand the difference
[2:20:30] I understand the difference and then I
[2:20:32] don't
[2:20:33] right I see there is a difference and
[2:20:35] then I see there's not a difference
[2:20:37] but I know where most of us are and we
[2:20:39] better emphasize the difference
[2:20:43] because we may not yet quite be ready
[2:20:46] to embrace the fullness of what the
[2:20:48] word's really teaching Us in this hour
[2:20:50] where we come from
[2:20:52] come on but we're coming up
[2:20:56] now we're in Saint John okay read all
[2:20:58] that uh gave his life for us then his
[2:21:00] Spirit comes back on us upon us Jesus
[2:21:03] said at that day you'll know at that day
[2:21:06] you'll know that I'm in the father
[2:21:11] I'm in the father
[2:21:13] the father in me
[2:21:16] I in you
[2:21:17] [Laughter]
[2:21:21] [Music]
[2:21:27] and you and me
[2:21:29] so I said that is so confusing no
[2:21:33] no it's really not
[2:21:35] no it's really not a paragraph 33 see
[2:21:38] it's God
[2:21:40] all along
[2:21:42] God manifesting himself working himself
[2:21:45] through different ages so those three of
[2:21:48] Father Son and Holy Spirit same God
[2:21:51] working in three attributes we know that
[2:21:54] don't we let's go on
[2:21:56] and we today are one
[2:22:01] can we go back Austin
[2:22:06] so these three Father Son and Holy
[2:22:08] Spirit same God working in three
[2:22:10] attributes period now
[2:22:14] and we today
[2:22:16] are one
[2:22:19] how could it be
[2:22:21] because Jesus said I'm in the Father the
[2:22:23] father's in me
[2:22:24] I'm in you you're you're in me and I'm
[2:22:26] in you
[2:22:29] an attribute of God's thinking before
[2:22:31] the foundation of the world to have a
[2:22:33] church so those which are in Christ
[2:22:37] are you in Christ let me ask how many
[2:22:40] are here today in Christ
[2:22:42] how did you get in Christ not by joining
[2:22:45] a church
[2:22:46] how did you get in Christ by praying a
[2:22:49] little sinner's prayer no
[2:22:51] that was only an entrance that was only
[2:22:53] a beginning
[2:22:54] you can't be in Christ unless you're
[2:22:56] born again you can't be fully you can't
[2:22:58] be fully born again without the fullness
[2:23:00] of his Spirit you can't have the
[2:23:02] fullness of his Spirit without having
[2:23:04] the fullness of his word
[2:23:09] so there are going to be many around us
[2:23:11] and Among Us and and and in this world
[2:23:13] that have the spirit of God the holy
[2:23:15] spirit of God fall on their flesh
[2:23:18] and that's powerful and that'll make you
[2:23:20] do all kinds of things
[2:23:22] they're going to be those that the Holy
[2:23:23] Spirit goes all the way down into the
[2:23:25] realm of the mind and the will and the
[2:23:27] emotions
[2:23:29] and that's powerful but where we really
[2:23:32] must show the attributes where where the
[2:23:34] rubber beats the road where things are
[2:23:36] really put to the test it's when we
[2:23:38] understand the Regeneration of the human
[2:23:40] spirit
[2:23:45] again I recognize that some replace the
[2:23:48] two they sort of describe them the same
[2:23:51] as I do but they replace the two and
[2:23:53] they have uh flesh Spirit soul
[2:23:58] but I'm going to do what he said I'm
[2:24:00] going to take everything he said back to
[2:24:02] the word and the word tells me that it's
[2:24:04] Body Soul spirit Spirit on the inside of
[2:24:08] the inside of the inside
[2:24:10] and so we've got to have an anointing
[2:24:12] that's rubbed all the way in
[2:24:15] it's not just getting the spirit on your
[2:24:16] flesh it's not just getting it in your
[2:24:18] emotion
[2:24:20] it's when your inner man has been
[2:24:22] completely regenerated the Fallen Spirit
[2:24:25] of man has been completely regenerated
[2:24:27] by his spirit and what that does is it
[2:24:29] actually creates a new spirit
[2:24:34] one with him
[2:24:36] that's really being born again and I'm I
[2:24:39] I'm not sorry to tell you but I I have
[2:24:41] to tell you that without the fullness of
[2:24:44] the word
[2:24:45] you won't see your need
[2:24:48] if you don't have the revelation of this
[2:24:50] message you won't see your need
[2:24:52] and you'll think that a little tongue
[2:24:54] talking is all it takes or a little
[2:24:56] jumping around feeling good is all it
[2:24:58] takes but if you understand the word
[2:25:00] that God has sent to us you'll
[2:25:01] understand that a transformation has to
[2:25:03] take place on the inside of the inside
[2:25:06] that's where the real work of
[2:25:08] regeneration takes place and it works
[2:25:10] itself out
[2:25:11] it works itself out it's not an outward
[2:25:14] work going in it's an inward work coming
[2:25:16] out
[2:25:17] it's not dressing the part and then
[2:25:19] dealing with the rest it's getting it in
[2:25:21] here
[2:25:22] and letting that flow out are you still
[2:25:25] with me good we've got a little more
[2:25:27] time so those which are in Christ was in
[2:25:30] Christ at the beginning that was his
[2:25:32] thoughts and his thoughts is his
[2:25:34] attributes
[2:25:36] that's good now paragraph 79 uh the
[2:25:40] sermon is the same
[2:25:46] seed shall not be aired with the shut
[2:25:49] he goes on to say he was God the logos
[2:25:52] the word that went out of God when it
[2:25:55] began to brood upon the Earth remember
[2:25:57] we just mentioned that and brought forth
[2:25:59] marine life
[2:26:00] when the spirit of God below Goss the
[2:26:03] word which God said let there be and
[2:26:07] there went out the logos there went the
[2:26:09] logos which is the word
[2:26:12] so when God spoke that logos went out to
[2:26:16] perform
[2:26:18] to accomplish
[2:26:21] and the word began to cause all this
[2:26:24] excuse me because all this was in the
[2:26:26] logos the whole word of God
[2:26:29] the whole Bible for every age and as the
[2:26:32] logos began to breathe upon the Earth
[2:26:34] there came marine life and building up
[2:26:37] the bird life on up to animal life
[2:26:40] remember what he was really doing is
[2:26:42] restoring the word that had already been
[2:26:44] spoken and the seed that lay beneath the
[2:26:46] surface of the water and finally there
[2:26:49] comes something in the representation or
[2:26:52] look like the thing that was brewing it
[2:26:54] brooding over it God
[2:26:56] a man in the very image of God we know
[2:27:01] him as Adam or Adam
[2:27:04] because he was made of the red Earth
[2:27:05] that man fell
[2:27:09] like the seed has to fall
[2:27:12] you don't miss that what's he talking
[2:27:14] about the seed has to fall the Bible
[2:27:16] said a seed has to fall into the Earth
[2:27:18] because there are many sons to come
[2:27:21] the son becomes a seed and the seed is
[2:27:24] there for a harvest to follow
[2:27:26] and then then God uh began to brood over
[2:27:29] that after the fall
[2:27:31] he brought up an Enoch he brought up an
[2:27:33] Elijah he brought up a Moses he brought
[2:27:35] a prophet after prophet
[2:27:37] trying to restore that image again what
[2:27:40] image a man in the likeness and in the
[2:27:44] image of God that's what he was trying
[2:27:46] to restore because Adam Lost That Glory
[2:27:49] he lost that Glory
[2:27:52] are you with me
[2:27:53] good I'll hurry and finally upon the
[2:27:56] Earth came the genuine image of God
[2:27:58] himself again which was God Jesus
[2:28:01] the logos made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[2:28:05] praise God now in paragraph 81 he said
[2:28:09] now that same logos has a part he has
[2:28:12] got a bride
[2:28:13] wait a minute wait a minute whoa
[2:28:16] that same logos has a part there's a
[2:28:19] part in that logos there's a portion in
[2:28:23] that logos
[2:28:24] and the portion in that logos is the
[2:28:27] bride
[2:28:31] same seed
[2:28:35] and the same logos this word that cannot
[2:28:38] be tampered with
[2:28:44] it's brooding over the churches today
[2:28:48] see him see him making love
[2:28:52] trying to bring back the word
[2:28:55] to its full manifestation now now what
[2:28:59] is the word
[2:29:00] in its full manifestation
[2:29:04] a man
[2:29:06] in the image
[2:29:08] and likeness of God
[2:29:12] Adam was one Fallen seed
[2:29:15] he went into the ground
[2:29:17] Jesus was one seed went into the ground
[2:29:20] it's time for the manifestation and the
[2:29:22] multiplication of that seed to come
[2:29:24] forth which will be as brother skip said
[2:29:26] in the back sons of God
[2:29:29] and those sons of God will be men women
[2:29:33] made in the image and the likeness of
[2:29:37] God
[2:29:38] and because we won't have time to get to
[2:29:40] where I want to go today let me just
[2:29:42] give you a little a little teaser here
[2:29:43] and that is and when that when that
[2:29:46] group of people begin to move
[2:29:50] in Divine synchronization with the word
[2:29:52] of the hour of the word of God the logos
[2:29:55] Among Us when they begin to move in
[2:29:57] Divine synchronization with that word
[2:29:59] what they say
[2:30:03] she will have the saith the Lord or she
[2:30:07] will keep still
[2:30:10] what is thus say of the Lord that's his
[2:30:13] talk
[2:30:14] that's what he says it's the same
[2:30:19] that's what the sons of God are executed
[2:30:21] here for
[2:30:23] to manifest that Authority
[2:30:26] what Authority the authority of sonship
[2:30:28] it's the placing of Sons Sons are being
[2:30:32] placed right now
[2:30:34] sons are being placed right now
[2:30:36] positioned right now in the Kingdom
[2:30:40] yeah
[2:30:42] just wait
[2:30:44] just wait
[2:30:46] that's why you've got to run away from
[2:30:47] the world and run to the word
[2:30:50] that's why you've got to hear this word
[2:30:51] every day that's why you got to spend a
[2:30:53] few minutes every day in the book
[2:30:56] you got to get in that holy book you've
[2:30:58] got to let that book talk to you come on
[2:31:00] you've got to sit under the anointed
[2:31:02] word for the hour you need to do it
[2:31:04] every day turn off the idiot box
[2:31:08] somebody said I don't have time you got
[2:31:10] time for that
[2:31:12] you got time for a game to play
[2:31:15] nothing wrong with fun don't go paranoid
[2:31:17] don't go pan again don't get religious
[2:31:21] you need a moment you need a time you
[2:31:24] need to defragment you need some singing
[2:31:27] or or or or some some fun nothing wrong
[2:31:31] nothing wrong with pulling away and
[2:31:34] relaxing a little bit
[2:31:36] but if we are left without any
[2:31:38] accountability
[2:31:42] we'll live like chill pills
[2:31:45] we'll live like couch potatoes making no
[2:31:48] time I'm preaching now making no time
[2:31:50] for the word
[2:31:52] how are you and I going to come for
[2:31:54] speaking that word
[2:31:56] if we're not eating that word
[2:31:59] you are what you eat and you speak what
[2:32:03] you are
[2:32:06] [Music]
[2:32:09] that same logos has a party has got a
[2:32:11] bride and that same logos this word that
[2:32:14] cannot be tampered with is brooding over
[2:32:16] the churches today trying to bring back
[2:32:18] the word of God to its full
[2:32:19] manifestation let's go on which the
[2:32:21] prophets was carriers to that seed and
[2:32:24] the church denominations has been
[2:32:26] carriers to the seed now now notice
[2:32:28] quickly but like the shuck hugs
[2:32:39] I don't let people rebuke and and
[2:32:41] criticize and and spend all their Time
[2:32:44] Cursing the shook
[2:32:47] because the shuck is is a protector
[2:32:51] he calls it a carrier but it's more than
[2:32:53] just a carrier it's actually the
[2:32:55] protection it hugs the seed
[2:32:58] it protects it from the elements
[2:33:02] you have to pull that shuck off
[2:33:05] and brother that's where we are right
[2:33:07] now
[2:33:08] we're in shuck shedding time
[2:33:11] the shuck is pulling away from the seed
[2:33:15] come on and the Shucks got to go it's
[2:33:17] got to go thank you thank you for the
[2:33:19] shock but it has to go now
[2:33:22] because when you got that ear in your
[2:33:25] hand you have a multiplication of the
[2:33:28] original seed that was planted in the
[2:33:31] dirt that corn is a multiplication of
[2:33:35] what you put in the dirt a seed of corn
[2:33:38] you put in a kernel of corn now you got
[2:33:40] about 300 kernels of corn
[2:33:45] and how many ears off of a stalk
[2:33:48] multiple ears coming off of a stalk
[2:33:52] you take care of it you can have another
[2:33:54] another Bloom another Harvest
[2:33:57] come on
[2:33:59] and the church denominations
[2:34:03] has been carriers to the seed now
[2:34:06] thank you Chuck
[2:34:08] thank you my old churches thank you all
[2:34:11] my old systems where I were thank you
[2:34:13] thank you thank you for protecting me
[2:34:16] didn't feel like I was being protected
[2:34:18] but thank you anyway
[2:34:22] it felt like he was constantly trying to
[2:34:24] throw me out because I didn't do like
[2:34:25] you did
[2:34:27] but nonetheless God says the church
[2:34:29] denominations have been carriers to the
[2:34:32] seed now now notice quickly but like the
[2:34:34] shuck hugs
[2:34:36] holds in the seed now then what does it
[2:34:38] do
[2:34:39] then it leaves her
[2:34:42] Jesus was God he was his father was the
[2:34:44] great logos itself and he could not pour
[2:34:46] it all in Moses
[2:34:48] or he was a prophet
[2:34:51] and the word of the lord always never
[2:34:53] fails comes to the prophet there is no
[2:34:56] place no time in the Bible or since the
[2:34:58] Bible that the correct interpretation of
[2:35:00] the word comes to a theologian
[2:35:02] it's not in the scriptures never did the
[2:35:05] Pharisees never did the Sadducees and
[2:35:07] never did God raise a prophet out of any
[2:35:09] of them and never did he in the last
[2:35:11] days so seminaries are not producing
[2:35:14] today's Prophets
[2:35:19] didn't produce yesterdays won't produce
[2:35:22] the days
[2:35:23] what do you mean today's I'm not talking
[2:35:25] about major word prophets I'm not
[2:35:27] talking about Messengers to Angels
[2:35:29] I'm talking about five full prophets
[2:35:31] they're still prophets they still fit in
[2:35:33] the category and seminaries aren't
[2:35:35] hatching them out now let me read just a
[2:35:38] little more here
[2:35:40] and maybe I should close we'll see uh I
[2:35:43] know you're ready and of course of
[2:35:44] course you are but I I I don't want to
[2:35:47] leave in such a place that we can't uh
[2:35:50] kind of finish this Tuesday night if
[2:35:52] that would be the will of the Lord so
[2:35:53] let me read from the exposition of the
[2:35:55] seven Church ages
[2:35:57] the smyrnian church age according to
[2:36:00] Romans 4 16
[2:36:02] we find that God has given a sure
[2:36:05] promise to all of Abraham's seed and
[2:36:08] Paul puts himself and all believers
[2:36:10] under that designation because he said
[2:36:13] he says Abraham who is the father of us
[2:36:17] all we're talking about one new man now
[2:36:19] that's what the New Testament Covenant
[2:36:21] is about one new man then he goes on to
[2:36:25] not only narrow down his definition but
[2:36:28] rather to finalize it for in Galatians 3
[2:36:31] he identified the seed singular with
[2:36:35] Jesus
[2:36:37] and counted the seed plural children as
[2:36:41] children of promise and promise as
[2:36:45] having to do with election or the
[2:36:49] choosing of God didn't he say you have
[2:36:52] not chosen me but I have chosen you all
[2:36:55] right and then and that is exactly what
[2:36:57] we have been saying those who are of the
[2:37:00] royal seed are the elect of God or the
[2:37:03] predestinated foreknown of God and we're
[2:37:06] in the mind of God and in his thoughts
[2:37:09] now in very plain language listen
[2:37:12] carefully in very plain language the
[2:37:15] true bride of Christ was in the mind of
[2:37:17] God
[2:37:19] eternally though not expressed until
[2:37:23] each came forth in the designated
[2:37:25] decreed season as each member came forth
[2:37:29] it became
[2:37:31] expressed and took its place in the body
[2:37:35] beautiful beautiful thus this bride thus
[2:37:40] this bride is the literal
[2:37:45] spoken word seed bride powerful
[2:37:52] and though she is feminine
[2:37:54] in designation as bride
[2:37:57] she is also called
[2:38:00] the body of Christ
[2:38:03] it is very apparent
[2:38:05] that she ought to be called that
[2:38:08] for she was predestinated in him came
[2:38:12] from the same Source was
[2:38:15] eternal with him and is now boy that's
[2:38:18] good
[2:38:21] and is now manifesting God
[2:38:25] in a many membered body
[2:38:29] whereas once God was manifested in one
[2:38:33] member even our Lord Jesus Christ not
[2:38:38] anymore one member
[2:38:41] December
[2:38:43] 1965 the one man Ministry ceased
[2:38:52] it can never be it will never be it must
[2:38:56] never be a one-man Ministry ever again
[2:39:02] it must be a body Ministry
[2:39:06] for she is a many membered body praise
[2:39:11] God
[2:39:12] whereas God once was manifested in one
[2:39:16] member even our Lord Jesus Christ now he
[2:39:20] goes on last paragraph now then here we
[2:39:24] are coming to a conclusion
[2:39:26] as the Eternal logos God was manifest in
[2:39:30] the son and in Jesus dwelt all the
[2:39:32] fullness of the God dead bodily and that
[2:39:35] Eternal one was the father manifest in
[2:39:37] flesh if you believe that same man and
[2:39:40] thereby gain the title of son
[2:39:43] even so we even so we even so we even so
[2:39:49] we
[2:39:52] eternal
[2:39:53] in his thoughts
[2:39:56] in our turn
[2:39:58] became the many membered spoken word
[2:40:04] seed
[2:40:06] he was the original spoken word seed
[2:40:09] but even even
[2:40:11] in the same manner
[2:40:14] we are so Eternal in his thoughts
[2:40:17] in our turn in our specific age became
[2:40:21] the many membered spoken word seed
[2:40:23] manifest in flesh oh my oh my oh my
[2:40:28] you were seed before you were flesh
[2:40:35] was Jesus seed before he was flesh
[2:40:38] now we understand by the word you were
[2:40:40] seed before you were flesh
[2:40:42] beautiful chip off the old block
[2:40:48] and though oh this is so beautiful
[2:40:54] and in our turn became the many members
[2:40:58] spoken word seed manifest in flesh and
[2:41:01] those Eternal thoughts
[2:41:04] now manifest in flesh are thee are you
[2:41:09] listening are thee are thee are thee are
[2:41:13] thee
[2:41:14] are the
[2:41:16] and now
[2:41:19] those Eternal thoughts now manifest in
[2:41:22] flesh are the sons of God even as we are
[2:41:26] so called
[2:41:29] now look at this
[2:41:32] we did not become seed by the rebirth
[2:41:42] we were seed
[2:41:45] and therefore were Reborn
[2:41:49] for only the elect can be reborn
[2:41:53] because we were seed is the reason we
[2:41:57] could be quickened
[2:42:02] in non-seed there is nothing to Quicken
[2:42:07] why why because God saw their choice
[2:42:15] because God knew their thoughts
[2:42:18] he saw their rejection of him before
[2:42:20] they were ever born Our God to his
[2:42:22] infinite in his foreknowledge he saw
[2:42:25] that they and therefore they came to
[2:42:27] this Earth with no representation of the
[2:42:29] Original Seed
[2:42:30] and therefore there was nothing in them
[2:42:33] to Quicken so all the praying and all
[2:42:36] the fasting and all the track handing
[2:42:38] out and all the things that we do
[2:42:40] sometime
[2:42:41] you can only reach those who have a
[2:42:44] quickening seat a seed that can be
[2:42:47] quickened come on
[2:42:49] now somebody said that's a serious thing
[2:42:51] folks
[2:42:53] this is a serious word
[2:42:58] now here is where you better listen to
[2:43:00] your preacher
[2:43:03] God is not sending you to the bar
[2:43:11] just real simple it's just real plain
[2:43:15] you say somebody's got to tell them
[2:43:17] somebody's got to reach them somebody's
[2:43:19] got to do this somebody's got to do that
[2:43:22] like I told you the other day people
[2:43:24] will tell me what I don't drink I just
[2:43:26] go and play pool
[2:43:29] I just go cause I like the music
[2:43:34] let me tell you something the true seed
[2:43:37] of God
[2:43:38] cannot stand the atmosphere that's
[2:43:41] produced by the filth of this world
[2:43:45] you stand in the parking lot
[2:43:49] if you feel like God is sending you
[2:43:51] you'll be there to reach somebody on the
[2:43:53] outside
[2:43:56] you don't put yourself in that
[2:43:58] atmosphere
[2:44:01] unless you know that you know that you
[2:44:05] know that you know that you know where
[2:44:09] you're standing with God
[2:44:11] there better not be one hook in you
[2:44:17] I was in a spiritual experience one time
[2:44:21] and I met a friend of mine in the spirit
[2:44:23] now this is this is heavy for some of
[2:44:25] you that don't understand that realm
[2:44:27] which I'm one of them that don't
[2:44:28] understand it
[2:44:31] but I met a friend in that Realm
[2:44:35] I was going in One Direction he was
[2:44:37] going another
[2:44:39] and he was struggling like this really
[2:44:42] struggling
[2:44:43] and I said to him what's wrong what's
[2:44:45] wrong with you
[2:44:47] and he said oh there's nothing wrong
[2:44:49] with me and he turned and when he turned
[2:44:50] I saw the treble hook
[2:44:54] that had cooked hooked him in the back
[2:44:58] and God revealed to me the three things
[2:45:01] that had hooked him in the back
[2:45:04] and he was just twisting and turning and
[2:45:06] twisting and turning and twisting and
[2:45:08] turning a whole whole experience I won't
[2:45:10] go into all that experience but I I sat
[2:45:12] with that man
[2:45:14] my wife was with me and we sat with him
[2:45:16] and we told him the experience and and
[2:45:19] even uh you know gave some pretty good
[2:45:22] uh
[2:45:24] Insight thank you
[2:45:26] on to where these hooks were and why
[2:45:28] they were there and how they got there
[2:45:29] and how they were manifesting and he
[2:45:31] looks at me and says
[2:45:34] well
[2:45:36] I can't imagine what that is
[2:45:40] something in me screaming you're lying
[2:45:43] you're lying you're lying you're lying
[2:45:46] I don't believe that we're walking
[2:45:48] around with hooks in our in our
[2:45:50] spiritual lives that we don't know are
[2:45:51] there
[2:45:54] I believe we know
[2:45:56] I believe we know and I believe we're
[2:45:58] foolish
[2:45:59] to keep putting ourselves in the same
[2:46:01] environment and in the same situation
[2:46:04] that causes that hook to tighten a
[2:46:06] little bit if you're gonna listen this
[2:46:09] is powerful words that Jesus spoke to
[2:46:11] Peter and I know that some of you are
[2:46:12] stirred at me that's okay I'm big I can
[2:46:14] handle it
[2:46:15] Jesus gave some interesting words to the
[2:46:18] Apostle he said and when thou art
[2:46:21] converted
[2:46:23] now remember in the church we thought
[2:46:25] that just meant pray the sinner's prayer
[2:46:27] and you're converted but conversion is
[2:46:30] more than praying the sinner's prayer
[2:46:31] true conversion is actually the
[2:46:33] born-again experience
[2:46:35] and the born-again experience is more
[2:46:37] than just speaking in tongues or saying
[2:46:39] the Holy Spirit has come it's when your
[2:46:42] inner man that Spirit of man that Fallen
[2:46:45] Spirit has been regenerated by the
[2:46:47] eternal spirit of God
[2:46:50] and you're delivered you are delivered
[2:46:53] you're delivered you're delivered and a
[2:46:56] man that is truly delivered a man that
[2:46:58] is walking in True Deliverance ought to
[2:47:00] be able to go anywhere in any
[2:47:02] environment in any atmosphere with
[2:47:04] anybody and be who he was created to be
[2:47:07] but until that
[2:47:13] until you know that you're there and
[2:47:15] you're hopeless
[2:47:18] I can just hear the how the mighty are
[2:47:20] Fallen how the mighty are Fallen
[2:47:23] I have no clue I I don't know what
[2:47:26] you're talking about
[2:47:27] now fast forward a few months wife gone
[2:47:31] marriage destroyed Ministry in shambles
[2:47:36] not not years
[2:47:38] less than three four months
[2:47:41] sitting
[2:47:44] in your place
[2:47:48] in the beach
[2:47:55] and he looks back across the table
[2:47:57] I owe you an apology
[2:48:00] what
[2:48:04] you saw those hooks
[2:48:06] I told you I couldn't imagine where what
[2:48:09] they were and I knew in that moment
[2:48:11] exactly what you saw
[2:48:14] and I want to apologize to you
[2:48:18] now I'm nothing
[2:48:21] I just had a great love for that brother
[2:48:23] great great love for that brother
[2:48:26] God showed me that because he thought
[2:48:29] God knew me he knew I'd share it
[2:48:31] and I did
[2:48:33] now the man lost a whole lot
[2:48:36] he may never fully recover
[2:48:39] he may get out of here with the
[2:48:41] salvation of his soul
[2:48:43] but he may never fully recover from a
[2:48:46] moment that could have been dealt with
[2:48:48] a little prayer a little Deliverance a
[2:48:51] little confession a little repentance
[2:48:52] little forgiveness
[2:49:01] God gave him an opportunity to get it
[2:49:03] from out from under the pull of the
[2:49:04] drugs
[2:49:07] God gave him an opportunity to get out
[2:49:09] from the pull of sexual perversion
[2:49:13] God gave him that opportunity and God
[2:49:16] gives us an opportunity to come to Total
[2:49:19] Deliverance
[2:49:21] and unless we know we're walking there
[2:49:23] we need to be very careful
[2:49:25] where our influence comes from
[2:49:28] because the enemy wants you to fail
[2:49:32] here's the thing you can thank God for
[2:49:36] he doesn't crawl in and crawl out
[2:49:41] you ain't a bush
[2:49:43] you were his son from before the
[2:49:46] foundation of the world
[2:49:50] who can't lose him he can't lose you
[2:49:54] [Applause]
[2:49:56] he'll find you if you make yourself
[2:49:58] findable he'll restore you if you make
[2:50:02] yourself restorable if you will correct
[2:50:05] your path he will forgive you and
[2:50:08] deliver you and cause you to help others
[2:50:11] find their way to Deliverance
[2:50:16] amen
[2:50:18] we have to be careful who we yoke with
[2:50:20] and how we yoke ourselves to these kind
[2:50:23] of spirits
[2:50:24] if you were here this morning and you've
[2:50:27] got a little lustful thing that you
[2:50:28] battle with in your life then you've got
[2:50:30] to be careful in all of your friendships
[2:50:32] in all of your relationships
[2:50:37] don't ever let a woman put her hands on
[2:50:39] you
[2:50:40] that you're not married to
[2:50:43] you you tell her right up front you tell
[2:50:45] because the world is slick
[2:50:51] don't ever be alone
[2:50:53] in a place with just a woman that's not
[2:50:56] your wife
[2:50:58] same way woman don't you be alone in a
[2:51:02] room with a man like that that's not
[2:51:04] your husband without somebody right near
[2:51:07] you right close to you
[2:51:11] I have someone at the church when I'm
[2:51:14] counseling with even people that in this
[2:51:16] church that I love and Trust
[2:51:19] more or less because of how I Know The
[2:51:21] Enemy could talk and the Bible said let
[2:51:24] not your good be evil spoken of
[2:51:27] come on you don't have to be paranoid
[2:51:30] my grandmother was a bit paranoid she
[2:51:33] locked the door between cousins I mean
[2:51:34] she was just always you know just
[2:51:37] extra on the guard
[2:51:40] she would have been real real helpful in
[2:51:43] 2023
[2:51:47] but I don't want you to become paranoid
[2:51:51] but I want you to be wise
[2:51:53] because there's an enemy that wants to
[2:51:55] cheat you out of some of your destiny I
[2:51:58] don't have any to lose or throw away
[2:52:00] come on now
