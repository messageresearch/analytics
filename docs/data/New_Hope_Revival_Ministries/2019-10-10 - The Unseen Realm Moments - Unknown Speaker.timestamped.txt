[0:00] you're looking in faith to the unseen
[0:03] realm and that is the eternal existence
[0:11] [Music]
[0:13] there is something on the inside of us
[0:16] that has a connection to God that cannot
[0:20] be broken he's given us the gift of
[0:24] faith and faith is an anchor we've just
[0:28] got to keep throwing our faith anchor
[0:30] over into the realm of the unseen into
[0:35] the dimension of the supernatural into
[0:38] that spirit realm that the Bible tells
[0:40] us so much about and let our anchor drop
[0:44] over there in the unseen and take that
[0:47] as your absolute this is not reality in
[0:53] its fullness reality in its fullness is
[0:56] beyond the curtain of time reality in
[1:00] its fullness is in the realm of eternity
[1:03] thank God every one of us have a measure
[1:06] of eternity living inside of us by
[1:11] eternal life eternal life is a portion
[1:16] of eternity it's a seed of eternity
[1:19] that's been planted in every believer
[1:22] who has been baptized with the life of
[1:25] Jesus Christ oh if we can get a hold of
[1:28] that and live in that realm while
[1:32] walking through the negative if we can
[1:35] keep our spirit reaching out for what is
[1:39] over there
[1:40] and our eternal promise while we're
[1:43] going through difficulties down here I
[1:45] believe God will help us maintain our
[1:47] praise you can maintain your praise no
[1:51] matter what you're going through this
[1:54] morning if you'll reach your faith over
[1:57] there into that unseen realm and say
[2:00] Jesus that is more real that is more
[2:04] real than what I'm walking through this
[2:07] morning you can see faith in action but
[2:10] you can't see faith you can see love in
[2:13] action but you can't see love you can
[2:15] see joy and demonstration but you can't
[2:18] see joy but how many of you know Joe is
[2:20] real you believe joy is real you believe
[2:23] faith is real you be love is real but
[2:26] you can't see it you can if you know
[2:29] where you're looking you're looking in
[2:32] faith to the unseen realm and that is
[2:35] the eternal existence not only do we
[2:38] have to train ourselves what to think we
[2:40] have to train ourselves where to look we
[2:42] have to make a spiritual conscious
[2:45] faith-filled effort to choose to look
[2:49] beyond the scene to the unseen realm of
[2:52] faith with men things are impossible but
[2:58] with God how many things all things are
[3:06] possible
