[49:26] want to give the Lord another
[49:32] praise
[49:33] [Music]
[49:36] Hallelujah I don't know who ever told
[49:39] the church that any old praise will do
[49:41] but I'm not very fond of that person
[49:43] because that's not what the scripture
[49:45] teaches the Bible actually tells us to
[49:48] give God exuberant praise in Hebrew it
[49:52] tells us to lift up the highest praise
[49:56] to the King of Kings and the Lord of
[49:58] lords you may say a lot about us but I
[50:01] tell you what you can't say you can't
[50:03] say that there's not a people here who
[50:05] want to give God a high praise and I
[50:08] appreciate you this morning it's for
[50:11] him it's for him it's not for
[50:19] us you may be seated it's not for church
[50:23] we're not we're not rejoicing for church
[50:25] we're rejoicing for the King of Kings
[50:28] and the Lord of lords he's ever More
[50:31] Alive in my heart how many of you
[50:33] brought him with you to church when you
[50:34] came today you didn't meet him here you
[50:36] brought him you brought him here these
[50:39] little licks of fire when they get
[50:41] together brother bam said we're putting
[50:43] the pillar of fire back together then he
[50:46] divided himself on chavot on the day of
[50:48] Pentecost and now he's coming back
[50:51] together one great Pillar of Fire among
[50:53] the body of Christ we're very thankful
[50:56] for him and what he means to us today
[50:59] we've had wonderful Fellowship the last
[51:01] couple of days with the heern and family
[51:03] and just appreciated them so much and
[51:06] getting to know them and you know
[51:08] sometimes when you're meeting people for
[51:10] the first time it can be a little
[51:12] awkward uh but I'm just thankful that it
[51:15] wasn't that way because we're really
[51:17] blood
[51:19] related um I never even knew there were
[51:21] any Hein until I saw Kate on the stream
[51:24] one time and they and they said his name
[51:27] was heph and I said I've never never
[51:28] heard that name but yet we're
[51:30] related we we're kin folk because we're
[51:34] one
[51:35] blood we're one blood and it's not
[51:37] Shelly blood or heon blood or brandom
[51:40] blood or anybody it's his blood oh it
[51:44] wasn't the blood of a Jew or a
[51:46] gentile it wasn't the blood of a Greek
[51:48] or a Roman but it was God's own blood
[51:51] blood that he created specifically for
[51:53] the cause of redemption and that's the
[51:56] blood that's you know the word said
[51:58] you're not your
[51:59] own the life that you're living now is
[52:02] not your life you're now living his life
[52:05] it's not that human blood that's keeping
[52:07] you here no sir that's not enough
[52:11] because you die with the same blood you
[52:13] lived with even though the life is found
[52:15] in the
[52:16] blood but there is a
[52:19] blood that's keeping us keeping
[52:22] on good to see you in the house of the

[57:29] lot you do know that uh according to
[57:32] Jewish tradition you need to fast on yam

[57:38] evening an hour before the sun goes down
[57:40] you stop eating and then you don't eat
[57:42] again until there's three stars in the
[57:44] sky that can be seen with a naked eye on
[57:47] Saturday you're going to have the most
[57:49] amazing birthday you've ever
[57:52] had I know what you're thinking I'm glad
[57:54] I'm not a Jew but anyway God bless you
[58:03] amen if I missed you I certainly didn't
[58:05] mean to miss you we we also think about
[58:08] this week um when we look at the
[58:11] calendar I think about the fact that uh
[58:14] from Tuesday the 8th of October to to
[58:18] Thursday the 10th of October brother
[58:20] brandham was uh up in Sportsman's Hollow
[58:23] in Kentucky and he was hunting and and
[58:27] uh I heard him tell it just this week on
[58:29] tape and and he said I wasn't I wasn't
[58:32] asking
[58:34] God uh on my own he asked
[58:37] me he asked me what I
[58:40] wanted that's pretty powerful and by the
[58:44] power of the creative spoken word there
[58:46] was a a squirrel appeared not just
[58:50] once and U I was standing in in um the
[58:54] den room in
[58:57] Tucson many years ago it must have been
[58:59] about 1991 or
[59:02] '92 there was some visitors
[59:05] there I hate to tell this part but I
[59:08] always tell the whole
[59:09] story there were some sisters that were
[59:12] wanting to get some water out of the
[59:13] swimming pool because they thought that
[59:16] was brother brandom's swimming pool and
[59:18] they thought they'd take him some water
[59:19] home as though that was going to do some
[59:21] kind of you know there are Catholics
[59:23] around the message
[59:26] so brother George was very upset by it I
[59:29] was too and he said 'l sisters he said
[59:31] that's ridiculous but if you want to
[59:32] take a big Swig out of that swimming
[59:34] pool get all that chlorine down your
[59:37] throat go right ahead be my guest but he
[59:40] said that don't have nothing to do with
[59:41] brother
[59:42] brandham someone else was there on tour
[59:44] and they asked
[59:46] brother George they said that that took
[59:49] red red Kentucky squirrel there is that
[59:51] the squirrel that brother brandom spoke
[59:53] into
[59:54] existence and brother GE or just
[59:56] chuckled a little bit and he said no
[59:58] sister that's not the squirrel that's
[1:00:00] just to show foreign people who come
[1:00:02] here from other countries what a
[1:00:03] Kentucky squirrel looks like they don't
[1:00:05] look like our little pitiful Alabama
[1:00:07] squirrels they're big old red
[1:00:10] squirrels and she said well brother
[1:00:12] George she said what did Brother
[1:00:15] brandham and them do with the squirrel
[1:00:16] that he spoke into existence where there
[1:00:19] was no squirrel to be and she looked
[1:00:21] down he said he looked down at her and
[1:00:23] he said that's easy sister Billy Paul
[1:00:25] Adam
[1:00:29] why do you tell that I tell that
[1:00:32] because in that hour and in that
[1:00:35] Ministry the supernatural was almost
[1:00:43] natural if God said that to brother
[1:00:46] brandom I'm going to do it he just
[1:00:48] believed now we know that he had a
[1:00:50] special gift calling in Ministry but if
[1:00:53] God were to speak to your heart
[1:00:56] tell you he was going to move some
[1:00:58] circumstances around in your life you
[1:01:01] ought to believe what he
[1:01:02] says because the the the word tells us
[1:01:05] that we're a supernatural people serving
[1:01:07] a supernatural God yes sir and we ought
[1:01:10] to become not let the supernatural
[1:01:12] become common but let it be a part of
[1:01:15] our
[1:01:15] lives and I'll say this what many people
[1:01:18] won't say if it were not for the
[1:01:20] supernatural that God has done in this
[1:01:23] message and what I mean by that is
[1:01:25] making Jesus Jesus Christ the same
[1:01:27] yesterday today and forever it would
[1:01:29] just be another
[1:01:31] sermon but it was Revelation that came
[1:01:34] by Supernatural Holy Ghost inspiration
[1:01:37] and then he came and said
[1:01:39] amen and he ought to be saying Amen to
[1:01:42] your life and to my life anybody here
[1:01:45] today yes sir well I'm preaching and I'm
[1:01:47] not even
[1:01:48] preaching I want to sing a song for you

[1:11:10] [Music]
[1:11:19] minute I'd rather be an oldtime
[1:11:21] Christian than anything I know let's
[1:11:24] thank God for these music s
[1:11:29] today
[1:11:31] Leviticus turn with me to Lev oh no
[1:11:34] we're going to the old book it's all the
[1:11:37] same
[1:11:38] book Amen brother brandom said it's two
[1:11:41] wings of the same
[1:11:42] Eagle Old Testament New Testament you
[1:11:46] try to fly a bird with One
[1:11:48] Wing he don't get nearly as high it
[1:11:52] takes both Wings the old and the new it
[1:11:54] takes understanding God had to give it
[1:11:57] to this world first in uh in types and
[1:12:01] shadows and
[1:12:03] antitypes and then he had to come in
[1:12:06] reality and I'm glad he
[1:12:08] did I'm glad he came in reality I'm glad
[1:12:12] that he came and revealed to us what the
[1:12:15] old book meant what the old Covenant
[1:12:18] meant it took on flesh and the word
[1:12:22] became hello come on yes sir and the
[1:12:25] word became flesh and dwelt among us and
[1:12:28] we beheld his glory as of the only
[1:12:30] begotten of the father full of what
[1:12:33] Grace and Truth Jesus is not the the the
[1:12:38] representative of God you know there are
[1:12:41] people even around this message that are
[1:12:43] quite confused these days about the
[1:12:45] godhead and they're preaching Tunis well
[1:12:48] I want you to know brother Brandon
[1:12:49] wasn't
[1:12:50] tuness and he didn't believe in two
[1:12:53] persons in the godhead
[1:12:55] he didn't believe in three persons in
[1:12:58] the godhead he believed what the
[1:12:59] scripture said there are three that bear
[1:13:01] record in heaven the Father the word the
[1:13:03] spirit and these three are they're one
[1:13:08] they're one and somebody said well how
[1:13:11] in the world can you can you be the Son
[1:13:14] of God and be God I tell you it's
[1:13:16] something that had never happened before
[1:13:18] and is not happened in the same manner
[1:13:20] since and that's why the prophet of the
[1:13:23] Old Testament said who do you think
[1:13:24] could even believe such a thing
[1:13:27] something that never been done before is
[1:13:29] about to be done in the fullness of time
[1:13:32] God is going to come down the Son of God
[1:13:34] will become the son of man so that we
[1:13:37] the Fallen sons of men can be the sons
[1:13:39] of God brother sister don't you ever
[1:13:43] lose your shout over your
[1:13:47] salvation your
[1:13:49] Redemption amen we've been saved by
[1:13:53] grace and I first came came around the
[1:13:55] message they told me I couldn't talk
[1:13:57] about the blood I said whoa I can't be a
[1:14:00] part of something that can't talk about
[1:14:02] the blood they said well brother
[1:14:03] brandham said the blood didn't save you
[1:14:05] Grace did well let me just go a little
[1:14:07] bit further on that and tie some things
[1:14:09] together for you it's by grace that we
[1:14:12] saved not of Works lest any man should
[1:14:14] boast but Grace wasn't the
[1:14:18] token the life of the blood was the
[1:14:20] token so Grace became the transportation
[1:14:25] Grace is what took the token of the
[1:14:27] blood and brought it to your door
[1:14:30] stop if it had to been for Grace you
[1:14:33] would have never knew you needed the
[1:14:34] blood that's right and if it hadn't been
[1:14:36] for Grace you would have never been made
[1:14:38] in contact with the blood so we're saved
[1:14:41] by grace purchased by The Blood Bought
[1:14:45] With a price Grace didn't buy you the
[1:14:49] Blood Bought you isn't it wonderful when
[1:14:51] we can balance All Things by the word
[1:14:55] brother brandham said to brother Perry
[1:14:56] green whatever you do Perry keep your
[1:14:58] balance in the in the scripture
[1:15:02] Leviticus chap 16 ver 14 and 15 and he
[1:15:07] shall take of the blood of the bulock
[1:15:10] and sprinkle it I want you to say
[1:15:12] sprinkle sprinkle it with his
[1:15:16] finger upon The Mercy Seat
[1:15:19] Eastward this is a whole complicated uh
[1:15:23] setup here you take the blood and put it
[1:15:26] on the finger from the bulock and you uh
[1:15:30] turn
[1:15:31] Eastward toward the mercy seed and you
[1:15:35] sprinkle the blood it's a in the Hebrew
[1:15:38] it's a slinging like this you how many
[1:15:41] of you have ever had anything on your
[1:15:42] finger it was sticking to you and you
[1:15:44] just slung it like that that's what the
[1:15:45] Hebrews saying it wasn't a Sprinkle like
[1:15:48] the
[1:15:49] Methodist it it it was it was it was
[1:15:52] doing something like that and and
[1:15:55] letting that blood slip off the finger
[1:15:59] onto the mercy seat from the Eastward uh
[1:16:02] then he goes on before the mercy seat
[1:16:04] shall he sprinkle of the blood with his
[1:16:06] finger how many times not three times
[1:16:11] not five times but seven times God's
[1:16:15] perfect number the number of
[1:16:16] completion the number that takes us from
[1:16:19] Genesis all the way through the Book of
[1:16:21] Revelation the the number that means so
[1:16:24] much to us is believer sprinkle the
[1:16:26] blood toward the mercy seed on the east
[1:16:29] side seven
[1:16:31] times all you have to do is think a
[1:16:34] little bit that's that's like going to
[1:16:38] Ephesus going right down through it
[1:16:40] isn't it that's what it is then shall he
[1:16:44] kill the goat of the sin offering that
[1:16:46] is for the people and bring his
[1:16:50] blood within the veil and do what that
[1:16:55] blood do with that blood as he did with
[1:16:58] the blood of the bulock what was that
[1:17:01] sprinkle upon the mercy seat and
[1:17:05] before the mercy seat now that's an
[1:17:08] interesting little
[1:17:10] ceremony and it means something to us
[1:17:13] today we're not waiting on that to be
[1:17:16] fulfilled Church it has been fulfilled
[1:17:19] let me hear somebody say amen amen and
[1:17:22] then before you take your seat would you
[1:17:23] turn to Isaiah chapter
[1:17:26] 53 verse
[1:17:30] 8 this comes from the from the same
[1:17:33] chapter uh of of one that we quote so
[1:17:36] often he was wounded for our
[1:17:38] transgressions bruised for our
[1:17:40] iniquities I think that's somewhere
[1:17:42] around verse 5 is it is it
[1:17:46] 535 but I want to read verse 8 to you
[1:17:48] this morning he was taken from
[1:17:51] prison he was taken from prison
[1:17:55] and from
[1:17:57] judgment and who shall declare his
[1:18:01] generation question mark for he was cut
[1:18:04] off say cut off cut off he was cut off
[1:18:08] out of the
[1:18:10] land of the living for the
[1:18:14] transgression of my people God is
[1:18:18] speaking this is God speaking through
[1:18:21] the lips of Isaiah the prophet he said
[1:18:24] for the transgression of my people was
[1:18:28] he stricken can I read it one more time
[1:18:31] he was taken from prison and from
[1:18:34] judgment now I know you're standing and
[1:18:37] I know we're not supposed to talk when
[1:18:39] we're reading the I get all that that's
[1:18:42] the reason I cling to the ver to the
[1:18:43] quote that says that church is Sovereign
[1:18:45] local church I do a little bit different
[1:18:47] I'm sorry but I can't help it my my it
[1:18:50] opens up it just starts opening up
[1:18:52] before we ever bless it you you know why
[1:18:56] cuz it's already
[1:18:58] blessed I have stood in
[1:19:00] Jerusalem uh near the ruins of the of
[1:19:04] the high priest's house whose name was
[1:19:09] Caiaphas I have climbed the
[1:19:12] steps from the valley of
[1:19:16] gehenna hell up to that spot on on the
[1:19:21] Mount of Olives or Mount Zion we would
[1:19:24] say Mount
[1:19:25] Zion and I have climbed down the steps
[1:19:29] into the church of what is now called St
[1:19:32] Peter of
[1:19:34] gaku and that church is there to remind
[1:19:38] us of the of the rooster
[1:19:40] crowing but down in the bottom how many
[1:19:43] of you been there some of you been there
[1:19:44] with me down in the bottom of that
[1:19:47] church is a
[1:19:50] prison HED out of solid
[1:19:53] rock and almost all the archaeologist
[1:19:56] 90% or more of the archaeologists agree
[1:19:59] that that is the
[1:20:01] pit that is the prison pit that our Lord
[1:20:04] was kept in the night of his
[1:20:07] betrayal and when I read this verse I
[1:20:10] can see him in that prison pit he was
[1:20:14] taken from prison and from judgment and
[1:20:17] who shall declare his generation for he
[1:20:21] was cut off out of the land of the
[1:20:23] living for the transgression of my
[1:20:26] people was he stricken today we could
[1:20:29] say as a church of Believers we could
[1:20:31] say that my Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua the
[1:20:35] Messiah was cut off from the land of the
[1:20:38] living so that
[1:20:39] I so that all my transgressions could be
[1:20:43] forgiven and I could be made like unto
[1:20:45] God that's what the word says father we
[1:20:48] thank you that your presence is here
[1:20:50] because your word is here and where you
[1:20:54] and your word have preeminence you are
[1:20:57] there you show up again and again and
[1:20:59] again and today it falls my privilege
[1:21:03] and my responsibility again to address
[1:21:06] the elect lady would you come today and
[1:21:09] anoint my lips and my mind in such a way
[1:21:14] that I could get out of your way and let
[1:21:17] your word have the highest position and
[1:21:21] get all of the attention because you
[1:21:24] deser deserve the glory and the honor
[1:21:26] and the praise we will give you all of
[1:21:29] that because you are worthy worthy
[1:21:33] worthy in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:21:35] Christ we ask for this help and the
[1:21:38] saint said you may be
[1:21:41] seated I don't believe I gave uh charity
[1:21:44] this verse so she might not be able to
[1:21:47] pull it up but I would like for you to
[1:21:49] look if you have your Bible look just
[1:21:51] one time to Deuteronomy chap chapter
[1:21:54] 16:1 16 because it talks about the the
[1:21:59] Feast of the Lord the Feast of
[1:22:02] Jehovah a lot of times Gentiles refer to
[1:22:06] them as the Jewish feast there's there's
[1:22:08] not a scripture in the Bible that says
[1:22:10] that these things belong to the Jews it
[1:22:13] doesn't say Jewish feast it says the
[1:22:15] Feast of Jehovah or or yod the Feast of
[1:22:19] of of Yahweh the Feast of God they
[1:22:22] belong to him and the reason why they're
[1:22:24] holy to us the reason why they're sacred
[1:22:27] to us is because God said I'm placing
[1:22:29] them as a Perpetual
[1:22:32] reminder not of what happened then but
[1:22:37] what happened when they were
[1:22:40] fulfilled and when we look at
[1:22:43] Deuteronomy 16:16 we read about three of
[1:22:47] those particular Feast uh the highest of
[1:22:50] the three three times in a year shall
[1:22:53] all thy males appear before the Lord thy
[1:22:56] God in the place which he shall choose
[1:22:58] well we know what that place was it was
[1:23:01] Jerusalem it was the Holy Temple and
[1:23:03] that's where he put his name amen guess
[1:23:06] where he puts his name today in his holy
[1:23:10] Temple remember brother brandham come
[1:23:12] along toward the end of his ministry and
[1:23:14] what did he preach what house what house
[1:23:17] will you build me I know what Solomon
[1:23:19] built I know what Herod built I know
[1:23:22] what what Moses built in mishon in the
[1:23:25] Tabernacle of the Wilderness I know but
[1:23:28] I'm looking for a a house that I can
[1:23:30] live in in my people
[1:23:34] collectively this is not a one man thing
[1:23:36] anymore this is God raising up many sons
[1:23:40] the Bible tells us that Jesus was the
[1:23:42] first fruits of them which slept and he
[1:23:47] is the first fruits of those who
[1:23:49] conquered death let me tell you
[1:23:51] something there's a bride that's about
[1:23:53] to conquer death cuz he did he did it on
[1:23:56] our behalf there's a bride that's about
[1:23:58] to join in with his Resurrection Life
[1:24:02] the word in the Greek is anastasis and
[1:24:04] it means a reproducible resurrection the
[1:24:07] resurrection of Jesus Christ is a
[1:24:09] reproducible resurrection it's one that
[1:24:11] takes place in you and I when he changes
[1:24:15] us from Darkness to light when he
[1:24:18] redeems us from sin and death into the
[1:24:21] Glorious light and Gospel of Truth
[1:24:25] full
[1:24:26] Redemption and and and so we've got a
[1:24:28] lot to thank God for and and we ought to
[1:24:31] know just what he's done for us and when
[1:24:33] we look at these scriptures sometime we
[1:24:35] see it a little bit clearer so God
[1:24:37] placed his name originally in Jerusalem
[1:24:39] on the on the Holy Temple and he said I
[1:24:42] want all the males who are above a
[1:24:45] certain age to make your way to the
[1:24:48] temple three times a year and worship me
[1:24:53] that wasn't the only time they worship
[1:24:55] but it's the only time that they were
[1:24:57] commanded to come and do it in Jerusalem
[1:24:59] and those three are the Feast of
[1:25:01] unleavened bread which makes up a part
[1:25:03] of Passover is that right number one
[1:25:06] number two the Feast of Weeks how many
[1:25:09] of you know what the Feast of Weeks is
[1:25:10] it's chavot it's what the church calls
[1:25:14] Pentecost 50 pent 50 if you want to say
[1:25:19] it like brother brandham said he said
[1:25:21] seven sabbaths
[1:25:23] later we say 50 days brother bandam said
[1:25:26] seven sabbaths later you take that Feast
[1:25:29] of unleavened bread and you go seven
[1:25:31] sabbaths later and guess what you have
[1:25:33] you have Pentecost you have the Feast of
[1:25:36] Weeks coming to a reality and brother
[1:25:38] brandham saw the significance of that
[1:25:41] and he brought it back to the number
[1:25:43] seven he said you've got to walk through
[1:25:45] those
[1:25:47] sevens to get to the next
[1:25:50] installment of what God is doing and
[1:25:53] then after the feast of weeks or
[1:25:55] Pentecost is what soot or Feast of
[1:26:00] Tabernacles well we're in that exciting
[1:26:02] time right now this week was yam tah the
[1:26:06] blowing of the chofar the last Trump the
[1:26:08] great Trump of God and we there's so
[1:26:11] much significance there and we will not
[1:26:14] take time to talk about it again this
[1:26:16] morning but this coming week we will
[1:26:19] remember yam kapor the day of atonement
[1:26:22] something that is as it is as essential
[1:26:26] to Christianity as anything we
[1:26:29] believe you see there was a law that was
[1:26:33] established that the high priest could
[1:26:35] only come into the holy of holies one
[1:26:39] day a
[1:26:40] year but I'll show you in a moment where
[1:26:43] brother brandham said when that veil of
[1:26:45] the temple was rent in Twain there's
[1:26:49] nothing to keep this little bride
[1:26:51] out now we can go in and we don't have
[1:26:54] to wait till Saturday but I'm glad I
[1:26:56] don't have to wait till Austin's 30th
[1:26:58] birthday to go in behind the veil I've
[1:27:01] been in this
[1:27:04] morning I was awake at 6:30 this morning
[1:27:07] behind the
[1:27:08] veil and you better get behind the
[1:27:11] veil when you come in here to Worship
[1:27:14] the Lord you if you put your heart in
[1:27:16] this thing and you put your faith in
[1:27:19] this thing you're going behind the veil
[1:27:22] woo I love it because the very thing
[1:27:24] that was once established to keep me out
[1:27:28] on now is now
[1:27:30] established to keep me
[1:27:33] in brother brandham said when you go in
[1:27:35] there and that Veil falls behind
[1:27:38] you it shuts the world
[1:27:41] out and it shuts you in to the fullness
[1:27:45] of the glory of the Lord Brother no
[1:27:48] wonder listen somebody's waiting on a
[1:27:50] Rapture I'm I'm getting raptured all the
[1:27:52] time there is a Rapture there's a
[1:27:55] fulfillment of rapture but it's
[1:27:57] happening now that word rapture is not
[1:27:59] twinkling of an eye come on now the
[1:28:02] prophet told us through the writings in
[1:28:04] Thessalonians and so forth uh that that
[1:28:06] there's a shout coming and that's the
[1:28:08] message that has come so the Rapture is
[1:28:11] already in progress so when we get
[1:28:13] caught up out of the flesh not into our
[1:28:16] emotion but into the spirit we're
[1:28:19] already coming up into something yes we
[1:28:21] are we're already having little raptures
[1:28:23] on on the way
[1:28:25] to oh I can look at some of you and tell
[1:28:28] that you're just not quite there so just
[1:28:31] remain
[1:28:32] Earthbound amen you you can you can
[1:28:35] certainly live like a crow if you want
[1:28:37] to I know many eagles living like crows
[1:28:41] but I have made up my mind all I have to
[1:28:44] do is hear that it's for me in my
[1:28:48] day you see the Lord should have never
[1:28:50] let me hear this message because when he
[1:28:52] did I'm glad he did so glad he did but
[1:28:55] when he did I just couldn't put it all
[1:28:57] behind
[1:28:59] me you that know my testimony you know I
[1:29:02] called Brother Cleveland and I said
[1:29:04] Brother Cleveland will you do me a favor
[1:29:06] I want you to take me to where brother
[1:29:07] Brandon
[1:29:10] preaches this sermon has changed my life
[1:29:12] I don't I don't have to shake his hand
[1:29:14] I'd love to shake his hand I don't have
[1:29:16] to shake his hand but I would love to
[1:29:18] just be in the room where he's
[1:29:20] preaching and brother Cleveland said
[1:29:22] well I'm sorry brother Shelly he said I
[1:29:24] I I just I just failed to tell you I
[1:29:27] don't know why I didn't tell you I
[1:29:28] didn't think it was important when I
[1:29:29] gave you the tapes to tell you but now I
[1:29:32] wished I'd have told you that brother
[1:29:33] brandom passed away in
[1:29:35] 1965 I said you've got to be kidding me
[1:29:38] that was three years before I was ever
[1:29:40] born so once I come to the message begin
[1:29:43] to hear the message uh uh many years
[1:29:46] after that 20 something years after that
[1:29:50] I want you to know that I didn't know
[1:29:52] that it had to all be behind me because
[1:29:55] I kept hearing brother brandom say what
[1:29:57] was ahead for the little bride I heard
[1:30:00] him say it before 63 I heard him say it
[1:30:03] all the way through 64 I heard him say
[1:30:06] it all the way through 65 right up to
[1:30:08] Yuma Arizona where he preach the Rapture
[1:30:11] and he kept talking about what was to
[1:30:13] come for this little bride well they
[1:30:15] ought not to let me heard those tapes
[1:30:18] because once I heard that God was still
[1:30:20] with his people and that he still had a
[1:30:24] Supernatural representation in the earth
[1:30:26] in his many membered bride I said that's
[1:30:30] mine I'm going to have that if you would
[1:30:34] do like you were singing while ago if
[1:30:36] you'd rise up in the spirit of faith and
[1:30:38] take a hold of these promises and say if
[1:30:42] they're going to manifest in anybody's
[1:30:44] life they're going to manifest in
[1:30:46] mine somebody said I don't want to be
[1:30:48] selfish there's a time to be a little
[1:30:50] bit selfish here and that's when you're
[1:30:52] putting yourself in the promise
[1:30:54] if you sit there with a shovel and you
[1:30:56] keep shoveling these promises over to
[1:30:59] somebody else you'll miss your part what
[1:31:02] you ought to do is get you a spoon not a
[1:31:04] shovel get you a spoon and eat them all
[1:31:07] that's mine that's mine healing is mine
[1:31:10] sanctification is mine Holy Ghost
[1:31:12] baptism is mine fullness of the word is
[1:31:16] mine manifestation of the spoken
[1:31:19] creative word that's going to be mine
[1:31:22] too said it he said it you see what a
[1:31:27] lot of folks have done is they've
[1:31:28] celebrated what God did but what I've
[1:31:32] done is I've looked at what God did and
[1:31:34] I've discovered that he's still
[1:31:36] doing and that he'll do
[1:31:38] again you see there's a part of that
[1:31:41] Revelation 10 story that doesn't get
[1:31:43] told a lot and that's the last verse
[1:31:45] that's often Mis misquoted or not quoted
[1:31:48] at all and we shall do what what does it
[1:31:51] say right down there I can't get the
[1:31:53] verse I I'm not sure exactly what verse
[1:31:55] it is let's get down to that verse and
[1:31:58] we might even read it I have 10 pages of
[1:32:00] notes for any of you that know me you
[1:32:02] know that's a very short sermon and so
[1:32:04] I'm going to have to work very hard to
[1:32:06] get those 10 uh notes in here 10 pages
[1:32:09] of notes in here uh where it talks about
[1:32:11] prophesy again show me that is it
[1:32:14] 1011 and he said unto me listen and
[1:32:17] listen now I know you know Revelation 10
[1:32:22] 1-8 I know you know that a mighty angel
[1:32:24] came down I know you know but in the
[1:32:27] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:32:29] the mystery watch the verse stay with
[1:32:32] the word it was
[1:32:36] mystery singular
[1:32:39] mystery not
[1:32:41] Mysteries it was
[1:32:43] mystery and it was prophets
[1:32:46] plural not Prophet singular we got to
[1:32:49] stay right with the word there and
[1:32:52] here's what's important and he said unto
[1:32:54] me John who was a type of the Bride In
[1:32:56] The Rapture he said unto me thou must
[1:32:59] prophesy again before many peoples and
[1:33:04] Nations and tongues and Kings did you
[1:33:06] know that's part of the ministry that's
[1:33:08] going forth right now across the world
[1:33:12] in the many membered bride not that
[1:33:14] press press play and Obey crowd but
[1:33:17] those that understand that in order for
[1:33:19] the bride to have her full Perfection
[1:33:22] according to the word the only way
[1:33:24] she'll be placed in total unity and
[1:33:26] Oneness is by the ministry of a
[1:33:30] five-fold five-fold Ministry yes we need
[1:33:33] to press play and yes we need to obey
[1:33:36] but when we've come into this house
[1:33:38] we've also come to yield to the gifts
[1:33:40] that God has placed in the body of
[1:33:42] Christ it's the sound of many Waters not
[1:33:45] the sound of one water it's the sound of
[1:33:48] many Waters he said my my my
[1:33:52] my getting a little excited here calm
[1:33:55] down calm down calm down he said thou
[1:33:58] must prophesy again before many peoples
[1:34:00] and Nations and tongues and Kings who do
[1:34:02] you think is doing that that's the
[1:34:04] bride well somebody said I know where
[1:34:06] Christ is in Revelation 10:1 I mean in
[1:34:08] Revelation 10 I know where brother
[1:34:10] brandom is in Revelation 10 do you know
[1:34:12] where you
[1:34:14] are do you know where you are do you
[1:34:17] know where the last day bride is found
[1:34:19] thou must prophesy before many peoples
[1:34:23] Nations Tong T and
[1:34:25] Kings this is a message that has to go
[1:34:27] out not only in word form it has to go
[1:34:30] on in
[1:34:31] flesh
[1:34:34] form so sending the tapes is not enough
[1:34:38] you've got to be a person a Believer a
[1:34:40] brother or sister who believes this word
[1:34:42] so much that you experience the
[1:34:44] transformation that this word produces
[1:34:47] in the life of a real believer let me
[1:34:49] just say it like an old Southerner you
[1:34:51] just ain't the same anymore when this
[1:34:53] word impacts your life you just ain't
[1:34:56] the same anymore and if you find
[1:34:58] yourself slipping back to who you were
[1:35:00] you better hit the altar as fast as you
[1:35:04] can because I don't care what kind of
[1:35:06] problems we're going through this is not
[1:35:08] the hour to be
[1:35:10] lukewarm this is the hour to pull up our
[1:35:12] chair around the fire don't you warm
[1:35:14] your hands by a painted fire when
[1:35:16] there's lots of genuine fire for you to
[1:35:19] get a hold of are you here so these
[1:35:23] little three festivals there let's hurry
[1:35:25] these little three festivals there in
[1:35:27] Hebrew they're referred to by a couple
[1:35:29] different words but one of them is a
[1:35:31] moed and a moed is a feast or an
[1:35:34] appointment there's also a word in
[1:35:36] Hebrew that's used where these are
[1:35:38] referred to as dress
[1:35:40] rehearsals now how many of you know what
[1:35:43] a rehearsal is what do you do when you
[1:35:45] have a wedding
[1:35:47] rehearsal I hate
[1:35:51] them I don't ever get to just a attend a
[1:35:54] wedding I always have to have a part and
[1:35:57] weddings are rarely
[1:36:01] anointed everybody's nervous now we have
[1:36:03] some pretty anointed weddings around
[1:36:05] here but everybody's nervous and they
[1:36:08] you know they don't want to trip and
[1:36:09] fall and nobody wants to come out and
[1:36:11] their zipper you know how all it works
[1:36:14] and so everybody's all nervous and so
[1:36:16] sometimes it's just a dry dead ceremony
[1:36:19] you want to get through it as fast as
[1:36:20] you can so you can get it all over with
[1:36:22] and it doesn't mean very much to anybody
[1:36:24] present that's the truth you may not
[1:36:26] like that truth but that is the truth
[1:36:28] but that's not what it's supposed to be
[1:36:30] but the night before sometimes two
[1:36:33] nights before you have a rehearsal and
[1:36:34] you run through everything and everybody
[1:36:36] gets told where to stand and one of the
[1:36:39] reasons why I don't like it is because I
[1:36:41] never have liked a woman telling me
[1:36:42] where to
[1:36:44] stand just being
[1:36:47] honest and they put the little tape cuz
[1:36:49] they think you're
[1:36:50] stupid so they put the little tape down
[1:36:53] there and tell you to stand on that like
[1:36:54] you're a preschooler but if you didn't
[1:36:56] do that charity didn't do that if she
[1:36:58] didn't boss us all what would we look
[1:37:01] like but a rehearsal is where you run
[1:37:04] through
[1:37:06] it you rehearse the song you make sure
[1:37:09] the key is right sir hello and you can't
[1:37:13] let people just Jive down the aisle like
[1:37:16] they're going to a sock hop or something
[1:37:19] they've got to learn to walk with a
[1:37:20] little dignity down the out you know
[1:37:22] what I mean
[1:37:27] you know some people just wasn't made
[1:37:28] for dignity and they end up looking like
[1:37:30] camels coming down the aisle but it's
[1:37:32] all right but you go through it you run
[1:37:35] through it it's a run through and just
[1:37:39] about the time you think it's over
[1:37:40] charity comes down here with her uh uh
[1:37:43] what do you call it clipboard she comes
[1:37:45] running down here with a clipboard she
[1:37:46] said do it
[1:37:48] again well you know that's the very same
[1:37:51] Hebrew concept
[1:37:54] that God instituted concerning these
[1:37:56] Feast of Jehovah he said lest you forget
[1:38:00] what they mean I want you to do it every
[1:38:06] year the Bible tells us in the Book of
[1:38:09] Ezekiel that we will be remembering the
[1:38:12] Feast of the Tabernacles in the time of
[1:38:14] the
[1:38:16] Millennium it has nothing to do with
[1:38:19] just Jews it's a one new man reality
[1:38:23] amen he said it is a
[1:38:26] Perpetual Feast unto the Lord so what
[1:38:31] what happened in the Old Testament and
[1:38:33] still happens today among the Jews who
[1:38:35] are not Believers in Yeshua is they just
[1:38:38] keep rehearsing this thing and
[1:38:39] rehearsing this thing and never quite
[1:38:41] getting it right but one of these
[1:38:45] days it's going to be the real deal woo
[1:38:49] it's not going to be rehearsals anymore
[1:38:52] we're going to see that every everything
[1:38:53] that hasn't already been fulfilled how
[1:38:56] many of you know spring feasts are
[1:38:57] fulfilled brother brandom taught us that
[1:38:59] the crucifixion of Christ fulfill the
[1:39:01] Passover and so forth the pouring out of
[1:39:04] the Holy Ghost fulfill the chavot
[1:39:06] Pentecost all that's in place but not
[1:39:09] all the fall Feast have had their
[1:39:12] fullness amen and they're going to one
[1:39:15] of these days yes sir
[1:39:18] Hallelujah there's going to be a
[1:39:21] blast that's going to wake up the Dead
[1:39:25] the voice of the Archangel the voice of
[1:39:28] the Resurrection it's going to wake up
[1:39:31] the day and then it won't be a dress
[1:39:32] rehearsal anymore for this little bride
[1:39:34] it's no longer a dress rehearsal because
[1:39:36] we've seen the reality of what God's
[1:39:38] word promised us if you believe that say
[1:39:41] Amen so we often call them the moed or
[1:39:44] the moedim plural of the Lord the Feast
[1:39:46] of the Lord three of them were major
[1:39:48] ones as we mentioned a moment ago and
[1:39:50] three three times a year every male had
[1:39:53] to come to Jerusalem and worship it was
[1:39:55] commanded it wasn't suggested there's
[1:39:57] one thing you should know about God's
[1:39:59] Commandments they're not
[1:40:02] suggestions they're
[1:40:04] Commandments and so the three feasts we
[1:40:07] talked about them one Feast of
[1:40:08] unleavened bread which is a part of the
[1:40:10] Passover Feast of Weeks which we call
[1:40:12] Pentecost Feast of Tabernacles which is
[1:40:14] soote three times a year and just before
[1:40:18] we go into seot our Tabernacles time for
[1:40:22] a week
[1:40:23] to remember a day we're going to
[1:40:26] remember a day where Jesus says to us in
[1:40:30] the book of the Revelation that he is
[1:40:32] going to Tabernacle with us and he is
[1:40:36] going to wipe every
[1:40:38] tear do you know when Tabernacles is
[1:40:41] going to find its absolute complete
[1:40:43] fulfillment when you and I are with
[1:40:46] him in that place that he has prepared
[1:40:50] for us and the scripture said and God
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:56] himself not a pope not a
[1:40:59] prophet God himself shall wipe all their
[1:41:04] tears away there shall be no more death
[1:41:07] no more sorrow how many of you know that
[1:41:10] it's going to be the Fulfillment it's
[1:41:12] the finishing of God tabernacling with
[1:41:14] men my he fulfilled a portion of that
[1:41:18] when the word became flesh but the
[1:41:20] future reality is when you and I live
[1:41:22] with him in a new city that doesn't look
[1:41:24] like a
[1:41:26] cube it looks like a mountain it looks
[1:41:30] like a pyramid it's a holy place and
[1:41:34] this little bride is not going to be
[1:41:35] living on the outside of the city hoping
[1:41:37] to get in from time to time the the
[1:41:40] scripture tells us that we're going to
[1:41:42] live with him sit with him in his throne
[1:41:46] even as he has sat down with his father
[1:41:49] in his father's Throne we've got a lot
[1:41:52] to look for forward to now in
[1:41:55] preparation for seot you have the
[1:41:57] blowing of the chofar that's sometimes
[1:42:00] called in these days
[1:42:02] rosashana which is the head of the year
[1:42:05] and it's a Jewish New Year of sort but
[1:42:08] really biblically the feast is called
[1:42:09] yam turoa tooa which is the sounding
[1:42:13] forth of the chofar blast and the reason
[1:42:16] why those are important I don't know if
[1:42:19] we put that if I gave that to you or not
[1:42:21] but in the Bible and I didn't list the
[1:42:23] scriptures but there are scriptures that
[1:42:25] talk about three special trumpets that
[1:42:27] will sound to Israel and if you want to
[1:42:30] hear some some brother brandom
[1:42:32] Revelation and his important and
[1:42:34] Powerful Revelation you can go to the
[1:42:37] messages that he preached on the Feast
[1:42:38] of trumpets and you'll find some amazing
[1:42:41] things that he said there I rarely ever
[1:42:44] hear anybody quoting from that that
[1:42:47] message and it's one of my favorites
[1:42:50] because I understand it because I have
[1:42:52] my foundation in the Old Testament I'm a
[1:42:55] Bible student are there any Bible
[1:42:57] students here you know he said we ought
[1:43:00] to read our Bible two or three times a
[1:43:02] day somebody said I wouldn't have time
[1:43:04] for anything else yes you would he
[1:43:07] didn't say you had to read it three
[1:43:08] hours a time every time you read three
[1:43:10] three times a day but he said you ought
[1:43:12] to read your Bible a Christian he said a
[1:43:14] real Christian ought to read their Bible
[1:43:15] two to three times a day and I promise
[1:43:18] you if you'd take a little time and turn
[1:43:20] off the idiot box yes sir
[1:43:23] yours may be sitting in a corner or you
[1:43:25] may be holding yours in your hand but if
[1:43:28] you turn that off every now and again
[1:43:30] and open up the
[1:43:33] book and become a student of this word
[1:43:36] you'd be surprised how strengthening it
[1:43:39] would be to your everyday life sir you
[1:43:41] don't even know sometime you're being
[1:43:43] strengthened until you face a trial and
[1:43:45] you realize you're facing it in a way
[1:43:47] you've never faced a trouble before
[1:43:49] that's because the word is strengthening
[1:43:51] you how many of you believe the word's
[1:43:53] keeping us alive the word is
[1:43:55] strengthening us to stand in Satan's
[1:43:57] Eden here in the last days anybody here
[1:44:01] so then there's yam kapor the the the
[1:44:03] what we call the day of
[1:44:05] atonement and that that uh that word
[1:44:09] kapor in in Hebrew means an atonement or
[1:44:14] a
[1:44:15] covering and we are so thankful to know
[1:44:17] that the blood of Jesus has not just
[1:44:20] become a covering for our sin yes sir
[1:44:23] but it has become as the scripture said
[1:44:25] a
[1:44:27] propitiation a propitiation for our sin
[1:44:31] we are not just saved the church can
[1:44:34] call on the name of the Lord and be
[1:44:36] saved that's not what the bride is the
[1:44:39] bride is not just saved we're not just
[1:44:43] covered by atonement we are redeemed and
[1:44:47] redeem means we are being restored back
[1:44:50] to God's original thoughts about us
[1:44:53] before the foundation of the world now
[1:44:56] that Redemption is a powerful promise
[1:44:58] and the only way to understand the depth
[1:45:00] of it is to look at these dress
[1:45:03] rehearsals so we won't spend all of our
[1:45:06] time there today because I know it's not
[1:45:09] everybody's cup of tea and when I come
[1:45:11] to your house I can I can have your your
[1:45:14] favorite
[1:45:16] blend but but today you you you get to
[1:45:19] taste a little of
[1:45:21] this did we there we go the three
[1:45:23] special trumpets to Israel remember you
[1:45:25] can read about them in the book read
[1:45:27] about them in the Bible and you can hear
[1:45:29] Brother brandom talking about some of
[1:45:31] them uh in that in that message that he
[1:45:34] did on the Feast of trumpets the first
[1:45:36] trumpet is at Pentecost so at shavel oat
[1:45:40] there is a trumpet that is sounded the
[1:45:42] Bible tells us that it must be sounded
[1:45:45] and that is to
[1:45:46] commemorate the giving of the law on
[1:45:49] Mount
[1:45:50] SII where God himself according to the
[1:45:53] Hebrew of that verse God himself blew a
[1:45:57] chaar now that's pretty
[1:46:00] powerful God in the Book of Genesis came
[1:46:03] down and became a
[1:46:04] seamstress he made clothes the Bible
[1:46:07] said he made clothes to cover he took
[1:46:11] skins and he made clothes to cover the
[1:46:14] nakedness of Adam and Eve isn't that
[1:46:18] good when God gave the law at SII and
[1:46:22] the Earth Shook and lightning flashed
[1:46:25] there was a chofar that sounded and this
[1:46:28] is what a chofar looks like if any of
[1:46:30] you have never seen one and sometimes in
[1:46:33] the King James version of the Bible it
[1:46:35] will say
[1:46:36] trumpet but it's a it's a trumpet that's
[1:46:39] made from the Horn of an animal which is
[1:46:43] also quite
[1:46:44] spiritual because if you remember that
[1:46:47] when Abraham was told to sacrifice his
[1:46:50] only son Isaac up on the mountain and he
[1:46:52] was was willing to give him as an
[1:46:54] offering unto God he had the knife Drew
[1:46:57] back like this ready to do it and the
[1:46:59] angel of the
[1:47:01] Lord the voice of God cried out and the
[1:47:03] angel of the Lord stopped his hand and
[1:47:06] said do him no harm you see Abraham
[1:47:09] wasn't going to have to offer a
[1:47:11] sacrifice of his son he was just going
[1:47:13] to have to be willing to do it and the
[1:47:15] New Testament tells us that it was
[1:47:17] accounted unto him as if he did it
[1:47:20] because he was willing to do it and the
[1:47:23] New Testament tells us how he was able
[1:47:25] to do it he was able to do it because he
[1:47:27] believed in the resurrection and he knew
[1:47:30] that even if his son died before him
[1:47:32] that day that God was able to raise him
[1:47:35] to life again now you talk about putting
[1:47:39] your faith putting your your life where
[1:47:41] your faith is or your money where your
[1:47:43] mouth is let me tell you Abraham had
[1:47:45] real Faith he wasn't a perfect man but
[1:47:48] he had real Faith who in the right mind
[1:47:51] would take the life of their son knowing
[1:47:53] that God was able to raise him again it
[1:47:55] took it took a special built man and
[1:47:58] when Abraham was standing there uh in
[1:48:01] that moment there was a word that was
[1:48:03] spoken to him and if you look at that in
[1:48:06] the Hebrew it talks about he raised up
[1:48:09] his eyes and looked a far off and when
[1:48:12] you look at that in the original
[1:48:13] language it helps us to understand he
[1:48:15] didn't just look over the next Hill he
[1:48:18] was given eagle
[1:48:20] eyes that day Abraham had eagle eyes he
[1:48:24] didn't just see what was over the next
[1:48:26] Earthly heel he saw what was over the
[1:48:28] next spiritual heel and he saw that on
[1:48:32] that very
[1:48:35] rock on now that's the reason why our
[1:48:37] baby girl's name is Mariah and no she
[1:48:40] wasn't named after some Mariah Carri or
[1:48:43] some oh worldly ungodly half-dressed
[1:48:48] uh I'll
[1:48:50] hush because you know how they do
[1:48:54] I don't believe that a Believer I don't
[1:48:56] believe that a Believer is going to
[1:48:59] idolize that kind of trashy
[1:49:03] living that's right let me tell you
[1:49:06] something Taylor Swift like all the rest
[1:49:08] of them will burn in hell if she doesn't
[1:49:11] repent of her sin and is baptized in the
[1:49:14] name of Jesus Christ and filled with the
[1:49:16] Holy
[1:49:17] Ghost she may be the top influencer in
[1:49:20] the world right now in fact so much so
[1:49:23] that Miss Cala is very happy to tell
[1:49:25] everybody that she is supporting
[1:49:28] her now God help those little robots
[1:49:32] that are going to March down and vote
[1:49:34] because some pop singer that's right
[1:49:37] that's not how we vote we vote according
[1:49:39] to the own our own conscious and the
[1:49:40] leadership of the Holy Spirit we're not
[1:49:43] going to lead because vote because some
[1:49:45] influencer did such a thing is that you
[1:49:47] got to get your eyes off of what's going
[1:49:49] on out there in the world we named our
[1:49:52] daughter Mariah spelled m a excuse me
[1:49:55] spelled like the Bible m o r i a h in
[1:49:59] Hebrew it's Moria and it means the hill
[1:50:02] of the Lord the very same rock that
[1:50:06] Abraham was about to sacrifice Isaac on
[1:50:09] is the very same piece of rock that our
[1:50:12] Lord was crucified on it's a part of the
[1:50:15] same
[1:50:16] Mountaintop and there's only one little
[1:50:19] Valley that separates it from the
[1:50:21] mountain that he going to come back the
[1:50:22] second time and put his foot on the
[1:50:24] Mount of Olives on so when Abraham
[1:50:27] lifted up his eyes and saw a far off he
[1:50:29] was seeing that that he didn't have to
[1:50:32] kill his son because God Almighty one
[1:50:36] day was going to send a
[1:50:38] lamb
[1:50:40] woo somebody ought to help me preach a
[1:50:43] little bit here that God Almighty was
[1:50:46] going to send a lamb that was going to
[1:50:48] die on the same
[1:50:51] hillah this book lays together line upon
[1:50:55] line and precept upon precept sir that's
[1:51:00] good sometimes they stream the service
[1:51:03] they say you're talking too much about
[1:51:04] the Old Testament well I wish you I wish
[1:51:07] I wish everybody pay a little attention
[1:51:10] to the foundation on which this church
[1:51:12] is
[1:51:13] built the Church of Jesus Christ is the
[1:51:16] Fulfillment of all the promises of the
[1:51:18] old Covenant yes sir and in in the never
[1:51:22] mind come on
[1:51:24] now so Pentecost the first Trump then uh
[1:51:28] during the the sounding of the trumpet
[1:51:30] the feast the what the Jews call a new
[1:51:33] year which happened a few days ago it's
[1:51:35] it's instituted not by Jews but by the
[1:51:37] Bible The Book of Leviticus you can read
[1:51:39] it for yourself that one is called the
[1:51:41] last Trump but if you're reading along
[1:51:43] you'll find that sometimes the the the
[1:51:45] Hebrew or even the Greek is the great
[1:51:48] Trump the great Trump and that great
[1:51:51] Trump is the one that's going to sound
[1:51:54] in the second coming when his feet come
[1:51:56] down on the Mount of Olives and when the
[1:51:58] Jews who have rejected him look up at
[1:52:00] him and say what are the scars in your
[1:52:02] hands Zachariah tells us and he says
[1:52:05] these are that which I received in the
[1:52:07] household of my friends and both the Old
[1:52:10] Testament and Paul in the New Testament
[1:52:12] Romans chapter 11 tells us that all
[1:52:17] [Music]
[1:52:19] Israel will be saved now remember there
[1:52:22] are those who say they're Jews that are
[1:52:23] not Jews and this isn't even a Jewish
[1:52:26] thing after all but he says all Israel
[1:52:29] will be saved God gave Revelation to
[1:52:31] brother brandham concerning the fifth
[1:52:33] seal he saw those that had been martyred
[1:52:36] under the under the massacres of Stalin
[1:52:38] and Hitler he saw them held in a place
[1:52:41] in a in another dimension underneath the
[1:52:44] altar is what John called it in the book
[1:52:46] of the Revelation and they are crying
[1:52:47] out day and night don't you know they
[1:52:49] were crying out on October the 7th
[1:52:53] yes don't you know they were crying out
[1:52:56] don't you know their number swelled on
[1:52:58] October the
[1:52:59] 7th when those people were massacred
[1:53:02] without an opportunity to to even
[1:53:04] perhaps call on the name of the
[1:53:07] Lord and the only ones that are there
[1:53:10] brother ROM told us through the
[1:53:11] scripture is those that are placed there
[1:53:13] because of the testimony that they held
[1:53:16] which means they're held there for a
[1:53:17] particular
[1:53:19] purpose just like Jesus descended Into
[1:53:21] the Heart of the Earth and he led
[1:53:23] captivity captives and gave gifts unto
[1:53:25] men and preached to the souls in
[1:53:27] Paradise that brother brandham said
[1:53:29] we're already in prison and he revealed
[1:53:32] who he was to them remember the
[1:53:33] testimony meeting and remember how
[1:53:36] brother brandham dramatizes that that
[1:53:38] Abraham saw him and recognized him
[1:53:40] Shadrach Meshach and Abednego saw him
[1:53:42] and recognized him David said I've been
[1:53:44] singing about him for a long long time
[1:53:48] why did he do that he did it because he
[1:53:50] had to reveal listen this is the reason
[1:53:52] why why because nobody has eternal life
[1:53:55] except by the blood of Jesus
[1:54:00] Christ it's got to be Grace it's got to
[1:54:03] be
[1:54:07] blood so you can actually Mark out those
[1:54:11] paragraphs in the in the exposition of
[1:54:13] the seven Church ages when you read that
[1:54:16] some are given eternal life by being
[1:54:18] good to the bride that is not biblical
[1:54:22] no sir it's not according to the
[1:54:24] scripture and you don't have to quote it
[1:54:27] just leave it where it is brother random
[1:54:30] tells us from the Bible that you have to
[1:54:33] go by the blood that's the blood it's
[1:54:36] the life of God that sets you free from
[1:54:40] the bondage of
[1:54:42] sin now maybe you're given some Grace
[1:54:45] some special Grace or favor because they
[1:54:49] talk about the neighbor brother R talked
[1:54:50] about the neighbor who was who was good
[1:54:54] who wasn't a Believer but who was good
[1:54:56] to him and and and and makes this
[1:54:59] statement something like uh you know
[1:55:00] they'll be there and I have no reason to
[1:55:03] doubt that because a prophet had the
[1:55:05] ability to see
[1:55:07] ahead and know whether or not that
[1:55:10] person would call on the name of the
[1:55:12] Lord but you can be rest assured you
[1:55:15] don't have you don't get eternal life
[1:55:17] without without the Bible prescription
[1:55:20] that's
[1:55:21] right it's
[1:55:23] ABCs ABCs all you got to believe you got
[1:55:26] to always Believe come on goes right
[1:55:28] through gotta gotta believe confess you
[1:55:31] got to do it all well the great Trump is
[1:55:35] blown on the day of atonement and is
[1:55:37] believed by many that it will have a
[1:55:39] future fulfillment on that day of
[1:55:41] judgment when the Lord comes down with
[1:55:43] his feet on the Mount of Olives now I
[1:55:45] want to show you what brother Bram said
[1:55:47] we got to we got to hurry wow we got to
[1:55:50] hurry paragraph 130 come on Church help
[1:55:53] me now then once a year the high priest
[1:55:56] this is what this is what the day of
[1:55:58] atonement is once a year the high priest
[1:56:00] oh my had to be dressed in a certain way
[1:56:03] he had to be anointed a certain way he
[1:56:05] had to be Anointed with the perfume of
[1:56:07] the Rose of Sharon they put it upon
[1:56:10] Aaron's beard that Holy anointing oil
[1:56:13] and it ran all the way down to the hymns
[1:56:15] of His Garment he had to have a certain
[1:56:17] made clothes how many of you know it was
[1:56:19] so meticulous and so specific and it had
[1:56:22] to be a certain color and and the hemn
[1:56:25] had to be just right and there had to be
[1:56:27] an overlay that was made just right and
[1:56:29] another thing brother bam said he had to
[1:56:31] walk a certain way and on his end of His
[1:56:34] Garment he had a bell and a pomegranate
[1:56:37] a bell and a pomegranate how many of you
[1:56:39] remember that all the around around the
[1:56:42] borders of that outer tunic was a bell
[1:56:45] and a pomegranate he goes on to say and
[1:56:48] he had to walk a certain way and when he
[1:56:50] did guess what happened those Bells
[1:56:52] begin to
[1:56:55] sing and brother brandom is kind of
[1:56:57] dramatizing this and said a certain way
[1:56:59] to make that play he said holy holy holy
[1:57:01] unto the Lord holy holy holy unto the
[1:57:04] Lord so as that high priest is moving in
[1:57:07] and he's going to sprinkle that blood on
[1:57:10] The Mercy Seat even the even the hymns
[1:57:12] of His Garment are singing of the
[1:57:14] Holiness of the
[1:57:19] Lord you understand the little bells are
[1:57:23] ringing and they're not they're not
[1:57:25] advertising uh the soup supper at the
[1:57:29] church those little bells are not
[1:57:32] advertising the Halloween festivals and
[1:57:34] carnivals they have around you
[1:57:39] know there are celebrations to celebrate
[1:57:43] the gods of the Harvest and all of the
[1:57:46] things that pagan-make
[1:57:53] not even caring where it comes from or
[1:57:56] what it's all about or what it
[1:57:57] represents or anything like that even
[1:57:59] the churches are all absolutely gung-ho
[1:58:02] and crazy over that kind of a stuff they
[1:58:04] are but I want you to know when those
[1:58:06] bells were ringing on that priest's
[1:58:07] garment they weren't saying they weren't
[1:58:10] saying you know come to the festival
[1:58:11] come to the to the soup supper they
[1:58:13] weren't saying come to the watermelon
[1:58:15] cutting they weren't saying come to the
[1:58:17] birthday party they were saying holy
[1:58:20] holy holy holy hly holy holy holy holy
[1:58:25] holy holy un the Lord holy under the
[1:58:27] Lord holy under the Lord what's he doing
[1:58:29] he's approaching the Shak yes he's
[1:58:33] approaching the shakina glory of the
[1:58:36] Lord and look at what brother adom says
[1:58:38] about the glory the real
[1:58:40] Fellowship
[1:58:42] Hallelujah did you know that you can
[1:58:45] have real fellowship with the
[1:58:50] glory you can get in the presence of God
[1:58:54] and have real fellowship with the
[1:58:58] glory I dare you to do that and come out
[1:59:00] with a dry
[1:59:04] eye I dare you to do that and come out
[1:59:07] like a
[1:59:10] Baptist you can't grab a hold of Live
[1:59:16] Wire and behave like a dead
[1:59:19] dog you get under that glory and I want
[1:59:22] you to know it'll mess you
[1:59:24] up it'll snot your
[1:59:29] nose somebody said I'm a tough man
[1:59:31] you're know and I don't cry you're just
[1:59:33] getting the glory god will crack you too
[1:59:36] you old hard pot he'll crack you too
[1:59:40] I've seen some of the meanest ugliest
[1:59:43] toughest
[1:59:49] muscular motorcycle riding
[1:59:52] Jason I've seen some of them look like
[1:59:55] they hadn't had a tender moment in their
[1:59:57] life get under the presence of God and
[2:00:01] go down on their knees in the presence
[2:00:03] of the one who is Holy come on he'll
[2:00:06] make you somebody you've never been
[2:00:08] before he'll crush your pride he'll
[2:00:12] break your hard
[2:00:14] heart he'll make you just a sloppy
[2:00:17] mess brother bandom said every birth is
[2:00:20] a mess it doesn't matter whether it
[2:00:22] takes place in a in a pink little nice
[2:00:24] decorated Nursery in a hospital or
[2:00:26] whether it takes place in a pig pin the
[2:00:29] mess is the same human birth is a mess
[2:00:32] and so is the spiritual
[2:00:34] birth he said we need some more of those
[2:00:37] acts 238 tongue talking babbling
[2:00:40] screaming we need that power once more
[2:00:45] to resurrect this
[2:00:47] bride to Quicken us again we need need a
[2:00:52] quickening of the Holy Ghost that'll
[2:00:55] break us out of our church enity we have
[2:00:58] followed in the ways of the
[2:01:00] denominations and God's not going to
[2:01:02] have a
[2:01:03] bride God is not going to have a bride
[2:01:07] that
[2:01:10] behaves like that
[2:01:14] system he's going to have a bride that
[2:01:16] behave like they did when Pentecost was
[2:01:19] I didn't fall I'm okay you don't have to
[2:01:22] call the
[2:01:25] law Apple was more worried about me than
[2:01:28] you
[2:01:32] are s Joy said we can see you we know
[2:01:35] you ain't about to stroke we'll come up
[2:01:36] there if we have to we'll pray for you
[2:01:38] you'll be all
[2:01:42] right sweet is the
[2:01:45] song Sweet is the song I'm singing
[2:01:50] today I'm redeemed
[2:01:52] redeemed I'm redeemed trouble and sorrow
[2:01:55] you mean you don't have no trouble you
[2:01:57] mean you don't have no sorrow I didn't
[2:01:59] say that then why do you sing they
[2:02:01] vanished away because they have in the
[2:02:04] presence of the Lord you get under the
[2:02:07] Living Word and you don't have a care in
[2:02:10] the
[2:02:13] world your dog is dead and your wife has
[2:02:16] left you and I don't know what all else
[2:02:17] is going on but if you could press in to
[2:02:20] the presence of the
[2:02:23] [Applause]
[2:02:24] Lord every bit of that just melts away
[2:02:28] for that time and somebody said then you
[2:02:31] get out from under and it all comes
[2:02:32] rolling back in it
[2:02:35] might but you'll be able to face every
[2:02:37] bit of
[2:02:39] it sir why because
[2:02:42] once from my poor sinick
[2:02:47] soul Christ did every bird
[2:02:54] unroll now I walk
[2:02:58] redeemed and
[2:03:00] whole hand in
[2:03:04] hand with
[2:03:09] Jesus
[2:03:10] hand in hand we
[2:03:15] walk each
[2:03:18] day
[2:03:20] and it in
[2:03:23] hand
[2:03:25] along the
[2:03:28] way
[2:03:31] walking
[2:03:32] thus I
[2:03:35] canot
[2:03:38] Stray
[2:03:39] hand in
[2:03:42] hand with
[2:03:46] Jesus if you're not walking hand in hand
[2:03:50] with him you better better find out
[2:03:53] how and do it as quickly as you possibly
[2:03:56] can because he's what's taking us
[2:03:59] through now brother Brandon goes on
[2:04:02] let's go back to that quote I got to get
[2:04:03] a hold of myself because we've got uh
[2:04:05] time is ticking away and we have a few
[2:04:08] more pages to go probably about
[2:04:12] nine Hallelujah Shak of Glory real
[2:04:16] Fellowship brother B said now you see he
[2:04:18] he had to make a noise the only way the
[2:04:20] congregation could tell he was wasn't
[2:04:22] dead is because they could hear the
[2:04:28] noise would I ever love to just
[2:04:34] preach if you were standing on the
[2:04:37] outside of the average church across
[2:04:41] this
[2:04:43] world with your ear to the door would
[2:04:47] you even know that there was anybody in
[2:04:50] there with a heartbeat
[2:04:51] [Music]
[2:04:58] I think they're going to have to bring
[2:04:59] in the IV
[2:05:02] poles to resuscitate people that are
[2:05:05] dying on the
[2:05:07] bench and it doesn't have to be that way
[2:05:10] somebody said they're being reverent
[2:05:12] let's be real let's be real it's not
[2:05:17] often reverence it's more like
[2:05:19] rigamortus
[2:05:21] that's
[2:05:23] right you see the the example that we
[2:05:26] have is that even the high priest when
[2:05:29] he went into the most sacred presence
[2:05:32] the Shak the shakina cavod the heavy
[2:05:36] glory of the Lord that he began to
[2:05:38] tremble brother brandom is making it
[2:05:40] sound almost as though he did something
[2:05:43] to make that happen but I want you to
[2:05:45] know the the Hebrew of that verse is
[2:05:48] quite clear it was something that was
[2:05:50] happening on his his body as he
[2:05:53] encountered the holy presence of the
[2:05:55] Lord and I don't know if it was his
[2:05:57] nerves or if it was the glory shakes I'm
[2:06:00] not sure what it was but the bells began
[2:06:02] to ring out and it's the only way they
[2:06:04] knew that he hadn't died in the Holiness
[2:06:07] of
[2:06:08] [Music]
[2:06:09] God for Generations that high priest had
[2:06:13] to stay up all night the night before
[2:06:15] and couldn't even go to sleep because if
[2:06:17] he did he might have a defiling thought
[2:06:20] that would disqualify ify him from going
[2:06:23] into the presence of the Lord he had to
[2:06:26] wash somewhere up of 10
[2:06:28] times before he could even go behind the
[2:06:31] veil he changed clothes all day
[2:06:35] long it's the only day of the year that
[2:06:39] the high priest was commissioned by God
[2:06:41] in service to take off the holy miter
[2:06:44] and the breastplate and the Royal robe
[2:06:47] that the high priest wore you don't
[2:06:49] remember how beautiful it is the the
[2:06:51] stones on the breastplate the uim and
[2:06:54] Thim in behind that
[2:06:56] breastplate the band that little crown
[2:06:59] that goes around the miter and guess
[2:07:01] what it said inscribed on that little
[2:07:03] Crown it said Holiness unto the Lord
[2:07:08] It's Holiness then and it's Holiness now
[2:07:13] you can't approach God in worldliness
[2:07:16] and carnality you've got to approach a
[2:07:19] holy God in a holy way
[2:07:24] fools will walk with hob nailed shoes
[2:07:26] Where Angels Fear to trod some people
[2:07:29] ought to be careful
[2:07:32] amen but here the people were able to
[2:07:35] know because they heard the noise of
[2:07:37] those bails
[2:07:40] dinging and each time brother BR said it
[2:07:42] was like they were saying holy holy holy
[2:07:44] holy holy watch the man that's anointed
[2:07:46] and Aaron went in because remember Aaron
[2:07:48] was the first high priest in paragraph
[2:07:51] 13 2 talks about the shika glory and the
[2:07:54] noise and then in paragraph 132 watch
[2:07:56] the man that's anointed and Aaron went
[2:07:58] in packing the blood before him going in
[2:08:01] holy holy holy unto the Lord holy holy
[2:08:03] holy unto the Lord them Bells chiming
[2:08:05] out anointed going into the holiest of
[2:08:08] holies how the congregation used to
[2:08:10] admire that Man how he went in there one
[2:08:13] day and left his old staff this is
[2:08:15] talking about another time left his old
[2:08:18] staff that he had in his hand and when
[2:08:19] he went back in that staff that was dead
[2:08:22] been cut off nothing but an old stick it
[2:08:25] had come to life how many of you
[2:08:26] remember Aaron's Rod it had bloomed and
[2:08:29] had blossoms on it and not only that the
[2:08:31] scripture said and it bore
[2:08:34] almonds if it was just flowers that came
[2:08:37] on it we could say why that was just
[2:08:38] something pretty but God said it was not
[2:08:40] only pretty but it was
[2:08:43] fruitful because God put almonds on the
[2:08:45] Dead stick if God can put blossoms on a
[2:08:48] dead stick cut off from the life of the
[2:08:51] the almond tree if God can cause a dead
[2:08:54] stick to come to life and bear fruit in
[2:08:56] the last days don't you think he can
[2:08:59] have a bride filled with the holy ghost
[2:09:02] from the top of their head to the souls
[2:09:05] of their feet totally delivered sold
[2:09:09] out sold
[2:09:12] out not serving God
[2:09:17] halfway not trusting in some picture or
[2:09:19] some some icon
[2:09:22] but trusting in The
[2:09:25] Riches of his
[2:09:27] grace woo I feel like I ought to just
[2:09:30] run that was the basis of fellowship and
[2:09:33] then in the message called Revelation 4
[2:09:35] chapter
[2:09:38] 2 paragraph 218 I'm going to calm down
[2:09:41] now he said now now notice as they
[2:09:44] entered in the congregation could come
[2:09:46] there the priest could stand there but
[2:09:48] just the high priest could go in there
[2:09:51] that yam kapor that's the day of
[2:09:54] atonement he could only go in there one
[2:09:56] day taking the blood with him what blood
[2:09:59] the blood we read about what's he going
[2:10:01] to do with the blood when he gets in
[2:10:02] there sprinkle it seven
[2:10:05] times and he had to be dressed a certain
[2:10:07] way a certain garment he had to have on
[2:10:09] the ephod the linen ephod he had to have
[2:10:12] a bell and a pomegranate one to one

[2:15:30] holy holy while he was approaching God
[2:15:32] having the blood of the Covenant in his
[2:15:33] hand going before him bearing the blood
[2:15:35] 220 anointed oh my with certain perfumes
[2:15:39] his clothes had to be made by Holy Ghost
[2:15:41] filled hand registered hands make his
[2:15:43] clothes the rose of Sharon the anointing
[2:15:45] oil poured it on his head it ran all
[2:15:47] down his beard and then down over his
[2:15:51] place with the Royal
[2:15:53] perfume it's a beautiful picture we're
[2:15:55] getting here huh a pomegranate and a
[2:15:58] belt taking the the blood of an innocent
[2:16:01] lamb and he Dar to approach that Veil
[2:16:03] outside he'd die right there where he
[2:16:05] was standing so he had to go walking a
[2:16:07] certain way holy holy holy unto the Lord
[2:16:10] holy holy holy approaching God unto the
[2:16:13] holy unto the Lord holy holy holy he
[2:16:16] went there and G he offered the blood on
[2:16:18] the mercy seat once a year and while he
[2:16:21] was in there he was privileged to see
[2:16:22] the shik glory when the pillar of fire
[2:16:25] the amber light that came down that led
[2:16:27] the children out of Israel even smoked
[2:16:29] up the temple so no one could see it the
[2:16:31] glory of the Lord
[2:16:37] fell somebody ought to be crying out for
[2:16:40] that the glory of the Lord fell till it
[2:16:45] was all smoked up you know they tell me
[2:16:48] that in the in the denomination thing
[2:16:51] and the charismatic things and the
[2:16:52] things that the church does to keep
[2:16:54] people entertained that they flash
[2:16:56] colored lights around and have smoke
[2:17:00] machines they tell me that they have
[2:17:02] machines blowing off
[2:17:04] smoke in the church to set the
[2:17:07] atmosphere let me tell you something
[2:17:09] there was a
[2:17:11] time when you didn't need an artificial
[2:17:15] smoke you didn't need an artificial
[2:17:17] light flash because the real glory of
[2:17:21] the Lord was in the house and the
[2:17:23] oldtimers used to say it's milky in
[2:17:26] here I've seen it it's milky in here
[2:17:31] because the glory of the Lord The Cloud
[2:17:33] of God's glory has filled the Lord's
[2:17:36] house and he is here to meet needs
[2:17:39] whether you see him or not he's here
[2:17:42] today let me announce to you he's among
[2:17:44] us today to meet needs he's looking for
[2:17:48] a people that'll get serious before him
[2:17:53] right smoked up the temple so no one
[2:17:56] could see the glory of the Lord fell
[2:17:57] till it was all smoked up he came to
[2:17:59] himself he went in behind the veil and
[2:18:00] settled down on The Mercy Seat in the
[2:18:02] holiest of holies Most Holy Place woo I
[2:18:04] got to
[2:18:07] hurry I was waiting for you to say amen
[2:18:10] and he had to be dressed a certain way
[2:18:12] walk a certain way but when Jesus died
[2:18:14] listen let's get to the good stuff
[2:18:17] 222 pretty special number here but when
[2:18:20] Jesus died the temple veil rent how many
[2:18:24] of you know the scripture said it rent
[2:18:26] doesn't only tell us it tore it tells us
[2:18:28] how it
[2:18:29] tore from what from top to bottom God
[2:18:33] wanted you to know he was the one
[2:18:34] ripping it open it Wasn't Man changing
[2:18:37] his mind it was God saying I'm opening
[2:18:40] up the way not only a high priest like
[2:18:43] it was on the day of atonement but now
[2:18:45] whosoever Will can have that same
[2:18:47] anointing of the shakana glory and walk
[2:18:49] a holy life holy holy holy unto the Lord
[2:18:53] and approach in the very presence of God
[2:18:55] through the blood of Jesus Christ before
[2:18:58] him I want somebody to say am
[2:19:03] amen I want you to look with me just a
[2:19:07] moment to Leviticus 16 again God help us
[2:19:11] I know that I I feel you're you're I
[2:19:15] feel
[2:19:17] you I I think I've embarrassed some of
[2:19:20] of you this
[2:19:25] morning I'll tell you who I haven't
[2:19:28] embarrassed I haven't embarrassed
[2:19:30] myself so you need not worry about me
[2:19:34] verse 18 Leviticus 16 and he shall go
[2:19:37] unto the altar that is before the Lord
[2:19:39] and make an atonement for it and shall
[2:19:41] take of the blood of the bulock and of
[2:19:42] the blood of the goat and put it upon
[2:19:44] the horns of the altar round
[2:19:47] about and he shall sprinkle of the blood
[2:19:49] upon it with his finger seven times and
[2:19:52] cleanse it and hallow it from the
[2:19:54] uncleanness of the children of Israel
[2:19:56] let's go on to verse 22 all the way
[2:19:58] through and when he had made an end of
[2:19:59] reconciling the holy place and the
[2:20:01] Tabernacle of the congregation and the
[2:20:03] altar he shall bring the live goat and
[2:20:06] Aaron shall lay both of his
[2:20:09] hands upon the head of the live goat I
[2:20:11] want you to see that in your mind the
[2:20:14] high priest Aaron puts his hands crossed
[2:20:16] like this over the head of the live goat
[2:20:19] and confesses over him
[2:20:21] all the iniquities I want you to see
[2:20:23] what Jesus bore for me and you he
[2:20:26] confesses over the head of that goat
[2:20:28] what's a goat it's a scapegoat right and
[2:20:31] he confesses the sins of all of Israel
[2:20:34] on the head of that goat it's a
[2:20:37] transference it's a it's symbolic of
[2:20:40] transferring the sins of the people of
[2:20:42] Israel onto the head of the
[2:20:45] goat all the iniquities and the
[2:20:48] transgressions and all their sins
[2:20:50] putting them upon the head of the goat
[2:20:52] and shall send him away by the hand of a
[2:20:55] fit man Into the
[2:20:57] Wilderness and that goat shall bear upon
[2:21:00] him all their iniquities unto a land not
[2:21:02] inhabited out into the Wilderness he
[2:21:04] shall let it go let go the goat Into the
[2:21:08] Wilderness now if we were to take time
[2:21:10] to go on we can't I've taken on my time
[2:21:13] we would read about what happens to the
[2:21:15] second goat the second goat is taken and
[2:21:18] killed and his blood is sprinkled to
[2:21:20] cover the sins of Aaron his family and
[2:21:23] all of the sins of the people of Israel
[2:21:26] now brother brandham is preaching about
[2:21:27] the scapegoat several times in his
[2:21:29] ministry and when he does he said I
[2:21:31] think they made a little mistake there
[2:21:33] he said they say that one of those goats
[2:21:35] represents Christ and one of those goats
[2:21:38] represents the devil the reason why
[2:21:40] brother brandham heard that is because
[2:21:43] there was a name that was attached to to
[2:21:45] one of those goats when they drew the
[2:21:47] Lots remember Leviticus says they drw
[2:21:50] the Lots
[2:21:51] they don't just choose which goat is
[2:21:52] killed and which goat is turned loose
[2:21:55] it's done by a lottery they draw out the
[2:21:57] lots and one of them says unto Yahweh
[2:22:00] holy unto God and one of them says
[2:22:03] Azazel which is a word that is sometimes
[2:22:06] translated to the enemy or for the enemy
[2:22:09] or what we would say for the devil but
[2:22:11] brother bandam said the reason why I
[2:22:13] don't think it was representing the
[2:22:14] enemy and he was right it didn't
[2:22:16] represent the enemy it didn't represent
[2:22:19] the devil
[2:22:21] but that name is a name that was used to
[2:22:24] to to place on that goat to determine
[2:22:27] the one that would die and the one that
[2:22:28] would be sent back into the Wilderness
[2:22:30] but brother brandom is preaching away
[2:22:32] and he said that don't work he said I
[2:22:34] believe they both represent
[2:22:36] Christ he said they're both represent
[2:22:39] Christ he said one of them died and shed
[2:22:41] his blood just like Christ and one of
[2:22:44] them had to go out into the Wilderness
[2:22:46] even outside the
[2:22:48] camp who would also die at some point he
[2:22:52] said so so Christ died for our sins but
[2:22:55] before he could die for them he said he
[2:22:57] bore our sins just like they were placed
[2:23:00] on top of the
[2:23:02] goat let me let me read you this if this
[2:23:04] don't listen folks you don't have to be
[2:23:07] emotional like me but if this don't stir
[2:23:10] your soul your spoons fell out of your
[2:23:12] bowl I'm going to tell you that right
[2:23:14] now you need to find your
[2:23:16] spoon if this doesn't light your fire
[2:23:18] your Wood's wet
[2:23:21] let me let me tell you what a prophet
[2:23:22] said here calling Jesus on the scene
[2:23:24] paragraph uh 43 or 44 somewhere I I may
[2:23:27] have I may have actually misnumbered
[2:23:29] that because or either I skipped I think
[2:23:32] what I did is I give you 43 and 45
[2:23:34] didn't give you 44 for the sake of time
[2:23:36] but when the blood cell was
[2:23:40] broke in Jesus
[2:23:43] Christ what was
[2:23:46] released
[2:23:49] God he was God do you believe it that
[2:23:53] blood
[2:23:54] wasn't read it Jewish that blood
[2:23:59] wasn't that was a creative blood cell
[2:24:04] God himself was represented in that
[2:24:09] blood remember I sung a moment ago for
[2:24:12] so many years so many lambs were offered
[2:24:14] up but all the blood that was spilled
[2:24:16] could never fill that one bitter cup
[2:24:18] that's right this room would not be able
[2:24:21] to contain the blood that was spilled
[2:24:24] year after year after year after year
[2:24:27] trying to make a recompense for sin but
[2:24:31] what could not be accomplished Hebrews
[2:24:34] tells us Paul tells us in the Hebrews
[2:24:37] and brother brandham tells us in the
[2:24:38] Hebrew series that what the law could
[2:24:41] not accomplish in that it was weak
[2:24:43] through the flesh God sending his only
[2:24:46] son in the likeness of sinful flesh he
[2:24:50] didn't have to keep going into the holy
[2:24:52] of holies and coming out and going in
[2:24:54] and coming out uh a Hebrews said he went
[2:24:57] in one
[2:24:58] time once and for
[2:25:01] allall because when that animal blood
[2:25:04] cell spilled
[2:25:06] open all that was represented there was
[2:25:09] animal
[2:25:11] life Beast
[2:25:14] life it's not the
[2:25:17] same it's not tripartate
[2:25:21] it doesn't represent Body Soul and
[2:25:24] Spirit it's animal life it's a different
[2:25:27] kind of life and when that animal's
[2:25:30] blood cell is broke open it's just
[2:25:32] animal life but when the blood cell of
[2:25:35] Jesus
[2:25:37] Christ the real lamb the one that
[2:25:40] Abraham lifted his eyes and saw a far
[2:25:42] off it wasn't just a ram that he saw we
[2:25:44] know that he saw a ram in the bush and
[2:25:46] he took that RAM and killed that RAM and
[2:25:49] offered that Blood on the altar on Mount
[2:25:51] Mora we know that and later they could
[2:25:54] use the very Horn of the well I guess
[2:25:55] it's under here now they could use the
[2:25:57] very Horn of that Ram to blow the chofar
[2:26:00] to call the people to worship but what
[2:26:02] he was really seeing was more than just
[2:26:04] a ram to become a sacrifice that day he
[2:26:06] was seeing a lamb that would become a
[2:26:08] sacrifice once and for
[2:26:12] all somebody say once and for
[2:26:15] all that blood wasn't Gentile wasn't
[2:26:17] wasn't Jew it was a created blood cell
[2:26:22] read the next two words God himself and
[2:26:25] now through that blood making a
[2:26:27] propitiation for our sins cleanses the
[2:26:30] believer just a few minutes cleanses the
[2:26:33] believer takes all of his sins away from
[2:26:35] him as if he
[2:26:37] what
[2:26:39] what as if he never
[2:26:44] sinned the the blood of a lamb couldn't
[2:26:47] do that the blood of a goat couldn't do
[2:26:49] that
[2:26:51] there was only one blood that could do
[2:26:55] that it was his
[2:26:57] blood his
[2:26:59] blood that blood life falls on you it is
[2:27:02] though you've never sinned God puts them
[2:27:04] in the sea of forgiveness and the same
[2:27:06] God that was Upon Jesus Christ continues
[2:27:08] in The
[2:27:10] Believer are you too tired to listen
[2:27:13] doing the same
[2:27:15] works that he did
[2:27:17] here how
[2:27:20] it's the
[2:27:22] same
[2:27:24] [Music]
[2:27:24] [Applause]
[2:27:25] Spirit he was
[2:27:29] God
[2:27:32] manifested in a flesh of his creative
[2:27:36] son see
[2:27:38] now God
[2:27:41] woo take this
[2:27:44] trinitarian God created the
[2:27:48] son a iians 21516 And1 17 says this
[2:27:53] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[2:27:57] even the law of Commandments contained
[2:27:58] in ordinances for to make in himself of
[2:28:01] Twain Jew and Gentile one new man so
[2:28:06] making peace and that he may here's
[2:28:09] here's what this whole thing is about
[2:28:11] that he may
[2:28:12] reconcile
[2:28:15] both unto God in one body his
[2:28:20] by the cross having slain the
[2:28:25] enmity thereby does anybody find that to
[2:28:28] be a big word and that he might
[2:28:32] reconcile both unto God in one body by
[2:28:36] the cross having slain the enmity
[2:28:39] thereby verse 17 and came and preached
[2:28:43] peace he's fixed to talk about
[2:28:46] you to you which were a far off
[2:28:50] Gentiles and to them Jews that were nigh
[2:28:56] aren't you
[2:28:57] glad aren't you glad that Gentiles were
[2:28:59] not an
[2:29:00] afterthought aren't you glad that God
[2:29:02] made a way for you the moment he made a
[2:29:04] way for the Jew he made a way for you
[2:29:07] God doesn't see you different anymore he
[2:29:09] sees his people as one new man I need
[2:29:13] another moment in Hebrews
[2:29:17] 4:14 if you don't mind I'm going to I'm
[2:29:20] going to uh just to push the bucket a
[2:29:22] little further out there and get in
[2:29:24] bigger trouble I'm going to read this
[2:29:25] from the Amplified uh 14 and 15 of
[2:29:28] Hebrews 4 it says in as much then as we
[2:29:32] have a great high priest let me just say
[2:29:34] this to you you have a great high priest
[2:29:37] sister Ronda you have a great high
[2:29:40] priest sister Bethany you have you have
[2:29:43] you have a great high priest who has
[2:29:48] already you're not waiting on him to do
[2:29:50] the work he has already ascended and
[2:29:53] passed through the heavens Jesus the son
[2:29:56] of God let us do
[2:29:58] what we've got to hold fast our
[2:30:00] confession of faith in him remember why
[2:30:03] because brother brandom said he only
[2:30:07] confesses the intercession that he
[2:30:09] offers on our behalf is based on our
[2:30:13] confession he is a high priest of what
[2:30:15] comes out of our mouth oh that's rough
[2:30:19] that's rough I I'd like for you to
[2:30:21] record yourself
[2:30:26] sometime when you're yelling and
[2:30:28] screaming and slamming doors and
[2:30:29] throwing
[2:30:32] things when you're red in the face
[2:30:35] hello when you're red in the
[2:30:38] face almost cussing maybe you
[2:30:43] are maybe maybe doing some what they
[2:30:46] call Christian cussing some dangerous
[2:30:49] words that are right on the edge you're
[2:30:51] redac you're stomping your foot you're
[2:30:53] carrying on just like a a fallen son of
[2:30:57] Adam in that moment you need to remember
[2:31:00] to be very careful what comes out of
[2:31:02] your
[2:31:04] mouth because there are some things we
[2:31:07] would never want him to take before the
[2:31:09] father I'm just quoting listen I'm
[2:31:11] telling you what the prophet taught us
[2:31:13] there are some things you wouldn't want
[2:31:14] him screaming out in the heavens that
[2:31:17] you might say down here on the earth
[2:31:19] he's only obligated to carry what what
[2:31:21] we confess so we ought to be confessing
[2:31:24] more than what we're living in the
[2:31:26] moment somebody said I can only confess
[2:31:28] What I'm Living that's not the truth you
[2:31:30] don't confess what you're living you
[2:31:32] confess what the word
[2:31:34] says you may be living the reality of
[2:31:37] high blood pressure but the word
[2:31:40] says you may be living the reality of
[2:31:42] sugar diabetes but the word says you may
[2:31:46] be living a reality of arthritis but the
[2:31:49] word says your family may be falling
[2:31:52] apart but the word says so you don't
[2:31:56] confess what's really going on around
[2:31:58] you you confess what the word said and
[2:32:02] your high
[2:32:06] priest
[2:32:09] Hallelujah who has no hindrance in going
[2:32:12] right
[2:32:13] in he doesn't have to pause twice he he
[2:32:17] has no inferiority he has no insecurity
[2:32:20] he goes right before the right hand of
[2:32:23] power and authority on your behalf be
[2:32:26] careful what you say for we do not have
[2:32:29] a high priest who is unable to
[2:32:31] understand and sympathize and have a
[2:32:35] shared feeling with our weaknesses and
[2:32:37] infirmities and liability to the
[2:32:39] assaults of temptation but one who has
[2:32:42] been
[2:32:48] tempted I'd heard some of the greatest
[2:32:50] preachers of our day in Pentecost before
[2:32:53] I came to the
[2:32:54] message and I'd never heard one sermon
[2:32:58] on the on the latter part of this verse
[2:33:00] until I came in contact with the
[2:33:02] ministry of brother
[2:33:04] brandom never heard one person
[2:33:08] mentioned who was tempted in every
[2:33:11] respect as we are yet without sinning
[2:33:15] King James says but was in all points
[2:33:17] tempted like as we are yet without s sin
[2:33:21] never heard one preacher preach it never
[2:33:23] heard one Bible teacher teach it because
[2:33:26] in some way they felt like perhaps it
[2:33:29] would bring God down you know and make
[2:33:31] him too
[2:33:32] human if he hadn't wanted to do that he
[2:33:35] wouldn't have chose that
[2:33:37] path he wanted to come right
[2:33:41] down he wanted to come right down to
[2:33:44] where we were living and face everything
[2:33:47] hello hello hello hello hello hello
[2:33:50] hello he wanted to face everything that
[2:33:53] we're
[2:33:54] living the prophet takes that verse of
[2:33:56] scripture and expounds upon it and he
[2:33:58] says it means exactly what it says Jesus
[2:34:02] was tempted in every way that any man
[2:34:04] has ever been
[2:34:10] tempted yet without
[2:34:13] sin somebody said well that was easy to
[2:34:16] do for him because it was God you don't
[2:34:18] understand perhaps
[2:34:20] that he was 100% God and 100%
[2:34:24] man so there was a part of him that
[2:34:26] found that rather easy but there was a
[2:34:28] part of him that felt the struggle that
[2:34:30] you and I
[2:34:33] feel somebody said well you know it
[2:34:35] didn't mean he was tempted in every way
[2:34:37] doesn't mean doesn't really mean that
[2:34:39] well brother brandham goes a little
[2:34:40] further he said in any way that you can
[2:34:43] be tempted he said that's like alcohol
[2:34:45] or
[2:34:48] women now let's come right down to where
[2:34:50] we're
[2:34:51] living it says he was in all manner
[2:34:55] tempted like we are
[2:34:58] tempted yet without
[2:35:01] sin and he did that so that you and I
[2:35:04] could understand what it means to be
[2:35:06] divine partaker to be partakers of his
[2:35:08] Divine life I want you to look at this
[2:35:11] in
[2:35:12] closing page four we didn't get very
[2:35:17] far the word atonement
[2:35:20] is spelled a t o n m n t atonement it
[2:35:26] means a covering for
[2:35:29] sin but it means something else to this
[2:35:32] Le
[2:35:33] bride it means at one
[2:35:37] minant atonement at one minant because
[2:35:42] the Bible tells us here and we will look
[2:35:46] at it as musicians are slipping this way
[2:35:50] the Bible tells us I've got to find it
[2:35:52] because there's not time for it yet in
[2:35:55] my notes so give me just a
[2:35:58] moment the Bible tells us in 2
[2:36:03] Corinthians 5: 21 in the complete Jewish
[2:36:06] Bible and I'm doing this because it
[2:36:08] makes it so very plain this was Dr David
[2:36:12] Stern who wrote this uh
[2:36:15] translation and it's a beautiful verse
[2:36:17] it's one of the one of the it's handled
[2:36:20] masterfully you will remember it in King
[2:36:22] James I'll read it to you in cjb it says
[2:36:25] God made this sinless man be a sin
[2:36:30] offering on our behalf so that in Union
[2:36:35] with him at one
[2:36:38] me at onement
[2:36:42] atonement in
[2:36:44] Oneness what did Brother brandham call
[2:36:46] it so many times in Union
[2:36:51] in Union with him we
[2:36:55] might who's
[2:36:57] here help me read it fully share in
[2:37:01] God's
[2:37:04] righteousness he became as
[2:37:08] we he became one with
[2:37:11] us that we might in turn become one with
[2:37:17] him he who knew no sin sin became
[2:37:21] sin so that we might partake of the
[2:37:25] righteousness of God how are you going
[2:37:28] to live a halfway
[2:37:30] life when you Survey the Wondrous beauty
[2:37:35] of what God has done on your behalf how
[2:37:37] could you give him any
[2:37:39] less than your whole heart how could you
[2:37:43] even desire to be a Sunday morning
[2:37:44] Christian and nothing else when you
[2:37:47] survey the beauty of what it means to be
[2:37:50] at one in Union under the atoning blood
[2:37:54] of Jesus Christ with him it's bigger
[2:37:58] than life and if I had time I would have
[2:38:01] given you some other verses that talk
[2:38:03] about being divinely reconciled unto
[2:38:08] God we were once a part of
[2:38:11] him in his
[2:38:13] thoughts and life separated us we were
[2:38:17] sent into this generation into this hour
[2:38:21] all of God's thoughts didn't show up in
[2:38:24] leoda some of them showed up in other
[2:38:26] Church
[2:38:27] ages right there was a bride in every
[2:38:30] age but in the mind of God you were
[2:38:34] slated to show up in the last Church age
[2:38:39] in leoda and God saw your
[2:38:43] end in the same moment that he saw your
[2:38:46] beginning and it's not that you didn't
[2:38:49] have a choice Jason hear this carefully
[2:38:52] it's not that you didn't have a choice
[2:38:53] we have free will you had a choice but
[2:38:57] because God could see your end and your
[2:39:01] beginning at the same time before you
[2:39:03] ever came to the
[2:39:05] earth I hope this doesn't mean some ugly
[2:39:07] but they used to say you know before you
[2:39:09] were ever a twinkle in your daddy's
[2:39:11] eye before you you were ever in your
[2:39:14] mother's
[2:39:15] womb God knew you he saw your beginning
[2:39:18] and your end
[2:39:19] and he saw your
[2:39:21] decision the Bible tells us that he saw
[2:39:24] your choice how do you know the Bible
[2:39:27] says that because it says by his forn
[2:39:30] knowledge it's not by what he didn't
[2:39:32] know about you that he chose you it's by
[2:39:34] what he knew about you that he chose you
[2:39:36] by his forn knowledge he chose you and
[2:39:38] he predestined he said you didn't choose
[2:39:40] me I chose
[2:39:42] you but he was able to choose you
[2:39:45] because he saw that's right by for
[2:39:48] knowledge the choice that you were going
[2:39:50] to make and he didn't only see you
[2:39:52] starting out to serve Christ sister G he
[2:39:56] saw you starting out he saw he saw your
[2:39:59] yes he saw that it was an eternal
[2:40:02] yes oh that's good he saw your Sunday
[2:40:06] October the 6
[2:40:07] 2024 yes sir and he saw your
[2:40:12] end and what you're doing here is
[2:40:15] walking out yes sir that divine plan
[2:40:20] your destiny is
[2:40:22] determined by a divine
[2:40:25] plan by the great Symphony Rider the
[2:40:29] greatest Symphony riter there has ever
[2:40:31] been only a living God could put this
[2:40:34] thing together and let me tell you
[2:40:36] something you're going to make
[2:40:39] it you're going to make
[2:40:42] it you're going to make it yes sir it's
[2:40:45] not those who start it's those who
[2:40:46] finish but you see God knows as much
[2:40:48] about your finish as he does your start
[2:40:52] and you but how do you know preacher
[2:40:53] because I'm claiming the promises of God
[2:40:57] he told me to claim my house I'm going
[2:40:59] to claim my natural house I'm going to
[2:41:01] claim my spiritual house you're going to
[2:41:03] make it if you'll walk hand in hand with
[2:41:06] Jesus you have been reconciled back to
[2:41:10] God
[2:41:13] Amen and uh in in in the final
[2:41:19] 12th
[2:41:21] closing in the message demonology
[2:41:23] religious realm 53 1 paragraph 199 he
[2:41:27] died a
[2:41:29] sinner he said Jesus went he died when
[2:41:31] he died he went and preached to the
[2:41:33] souls that were in prison he died a
[2:41:36] sinner it's not a misprint he didn't
[2:41:39] misspeak it's exactly what 2 Corinthians
[2:41:42] 5:21 tells us if I had time I would have
[2:41:45] gone back to 2 Corinthians 5:21 and
[2:41:48] showed you in the Greek that there are
[2:41:51] two words there that are translated made
[2:41:54] two two different words one he made him
[2:41:57] to be sin for us so that we might be
[2:41:59] made into the righteousness of God in
[2:42:01] English it's the same word made in Greek
[2:42:04] it's to absolutely different
[2:42:06] words and what it means is simply this
[2:42:10] he was made
[2:42:13] sin the goat just got a word spoken over
[2:42:16] his
[2:42:17] head but Jesus Christ was made sin and
[2:42:21] the word made there the first made the
[2:42:24] first word that's translated made is a
[2:42:27] word that means
[2:42:29] recreated it means totally transformed
[2:42:33] so the body that he had was totally
[2:42:36] marred Isaiah prophesied
[2:42:39] it it was totally marred by sin his
[2:42:42] Visage remember Isaiah his Vis was
[2:42:47] changed and he did not look like
[2:42:51] God he didn't look like Jesus
[2:42:54] anymore no man the Bible tells us no man
[2:42:57] would have recognized him anymore
[2:43:00] because the weight of the sin of the
[2:43:02] world was so heavy on him on his head
[2:43:06] that it even changed the look not just
[2:43:09] the beating not just the beating marred
[2:43:12] the Visage but the original language
[2:43:15] tells us the weight of the sin of the
[2:43:18] world look my my
[2:43:20] sin your sin was enough to Mar him
[2:43:24] that's right the rotten that you have
[2:43:27] done the rotten that I have done was
[2:43:30] enough to change his image until he was
[2:43:33] no longer beautiful to his own mother
[2:43:35] who looked up and hardly could recognize
[2:43:38] that that was her
[2:43:39] son his followers could hardly recognize
[2:43:43] that they had ever followed the man that
[2:43:46] was hanging there suspended Between
[2:43:48] Heaven and Earth
[2:43:49] because the beating had had caused much
[2:43:53] disfigurement and swelling but the
[2:43:55] weight of the sin Paul said he was made
[2:43:59] sin recreated into an image of sin
[2:44:03] though he knew no
[2:44:06] sin so that you could be
[2:44:09] married because the second word made is
[2:44:13] from a Greek word that means married so
[2:44:17] that you could be married
[2:44:19] to the righteousness of
[2:44:23] God anybody
[2:44:28] here good I might preach another
[2:44:32] hour this is why I don't mind not having
[2:44:35] church on Sunday

[2:46:30] he died a sinner knowing no sin yet our
[2:46:34] sin was on him and God for his sins
[2:46:37] listen and God for his sins did
[2:46:43] what send him to
[2:46:47] Hell remember
[2:46:52] remember he stopped off in Paradise
[2:46:55] where the righteous Souls of the old
[2:46:57] Covenant were
[2:46:59] living and that's when they recognized
[2:47:01] who he was and repented called on his
[2:47:04] name how do you know they called on his
[2:47:06] name because they followed him out of
[2:47:08] the heart of the Earth the Bible tells
[2:47:10] us in the Book of Matthew that when that
[2:47:12] when that veil of the temple was written
[2:47:14] Twain it says many of the Saints which
[2:47:16] slept arose and walked again the streets
[2:47:18] of Jerusalem the Dead Walking Around
[2:47:20] Town who were the dead that were walking
[2:47:23] around town those who had died under an
[2:47:25] old Covenant but when Jesus paid them a
[2:47:27] visit in the heart of the earth they saw
[2:47:30] him they knew him then they rejected him
[2:47:32] perhaps at one time but they knew him
[2:47:33] then there he is that's the one I saw in
[2:47:36] the fiery furnace Daniel said that's the
[2:47:38] one that shut the lion's mouth and let
[2:47:41] me have a rest all night long come on
[2:47:45] folks Mary said that's the one I held in
[2:47:48] my my arms and Drew to my breast and now
[2:47:53] he's the savior of the world he created
[2:47:56] the womb that gave him birth and now he
[2:48:01] is there to save my
[2:48:07] [Music]
[2:48:09] soul how was he able to do that because
[2:48:12] God made him sin for you and then sent
[2:48:17] him to hell
[2:48:23] I'm okay I did not
[2:48:26] fall don't call
[2:48:29] 911 all is
[2:48:32] well and what did he do when he got
[2:48:37] there what did he do when he got there
[2:48:39] well we know he showed up to those in
[2:48:42] the in the in the in between what what
[2:48:44] the what we call
[2:48:46] Paradise but what what did he do when he
[2:48:48] went to H
[2:48:49] he walked right
[2:48:52] in now he walked right in he made
[2:48:56] it he knew the
[2:48:58] address the Bible said God's the one who
[2:49:01] created hell he created it for the devil
[2:49:04] and his angels was never created for man
[2:49:07] he knew just where to find it and he
[2:49:09] walked right in he didn't wait for an
[2:49:11] invitation he walked right in the doors
[2:49:14] opened let him in they recognized their
[2:49:17] creator he walked right in the Flames
[2:49:20] couldn't touch him the the horror
[2:49:22] couldn't touch him the sorrow couldn't
[2:49:24] touch
[2:49:25] him nothing could affect him he walks
[2:49:28] right over to the one that was created
[2:49:30] for this purpose yes Once the Fallen
[2:49:34] once Lucifer the created being who
[2:49:37] worshiped Before the Throne now the
[2:49:39] deceiver of all
[2:49:41] mankind and he walks over to him he
[2:49:43] doesn't have to say much he's just done
[2:49:46] the deed he just screamed on the cross
[2:49:50] it
[2:49:51] is finished if you think hell didn't
[2:49:54] hear
[2:49:55] it hell Shook at his voice it is
[2:50:04] finished he could have easily said man
[2:50:08] is now
[2:50:10] reconciled to God he could have easily
[2:50:14] said now you are at one me the Union has
[2:50:19] been made man reunited rejoined to his
[2:50:25] creator God but instead he just said it
[2:50:27] is
[2:50:31] finished I wasn't there but I like to
[2:50:35] think he did
[2:50:39] this kind of like a dad has to do when a
[2:50:43] teenager is abusing the rights to the
[2:50:45] family
[2:50:47] car and hand him over Jesus just walked
[2:50:51] right into the Imp and held out his hand
[2:50:55] and Satan had to take the keys to his
[2:50:57] own
[2:50:59] house death hell in the grave and put it
[2:51:02] in the hand of the
[2:51:04] lambah that was
[2:51:06] slain for the sins of the whole
[2:51:09] world what did Jesus do with it he put
[2:51:12] them on his hip how do you know
[2:51:14] Revelation 19 tells us that when he
[2:51:17] shows up at Second Coming time brother
[2:51:19] brandom said the bride leaves in
[2:51:20] Revelation 4 she doesn't come back until
[2:51:22] Revelation chapter 19 when he's riding
[2:51:25] on a white horse and the armies of
[2:51:26] Heaven follow him on white
[2:51:28] horses so you don't really believe that
[2:51:30] do you with all my heart I don't just
[2:51:32] believe it with part of my heart I
[2:51:34] believe it I believe my toenails I want
[2:51:36] you be honest I know feet are ugly but
[2:51:39] my toenails believe it everything I am
[2:51:43] believes that not only is he about to
[2:51:45] take this bride out of here we're going
[2:51:48] to enjoy a honeymoon with him and when
[2:51:50] it has come to an end we're coming back
[2:51:53] with
[2:51:55] him sir at the finality watch what I say
[2:51:59] cuz you can find it in this message
[2:52:01] it'll be the finality of the seventh
[2:52:04] seal that's what he said not Rapture but
[2:52:08] Second Coming read it again hear it
[2:52:12] again fullness of seven seal foot on the
[2:52:16] foot on the Mount of Olives there the
[2:52:18] earth quakes it opens up before
[2:52:23] him no more Jew and
[2:52:26] Gentile the Jew is called
[2:52:28] in the Gentile bride is on the
[2:52:34] scene one with him let's
[2:52:39] stand at on
[2:52:41] M so so don't wait until some day on the
[2:52:46] calendar don't wait until the somebody
[2:52:48] tells you today is the day of
[2:52:50] atonement because we don't have to do
[2:52:52] that
[2:52:53] anymore we don't have to we don't have
[2:52:56] to you you should be in Jerusalem on the
[2:52:59] day of atonement it's a it's a odd thing
[2:53:01] to
[2:53:03] see they don't kill Lambs anymore but
[2:53:07] they do the ultra Orthodox kill a
[2:53:08] chicken and they sling it around their
[2:53:11] heads on a
[2:53:14] string speaking a certain set of words
[2:53:17] to remind
[2:53:19] them that there is a covering that
[2:53:22] covers
[2:53:24] all I have sat in the city of Jerusalem
[2:53:27] with brother Perry green on the day of
[2:53:28] atonement I I found it I did a search
[2:53:30] for day of atonement on my computer and
[2:53:32] I found the report that he had
[2:53:34] written the reason why he remembered the
[2:53:37] day of atonement so well is because he
[2:53:39] was already ailing some slowing
[2:53:42] down and it took him a little longer to
[2:53:45] eat lunch that day and I said brother
[2:53:48] green if we don't go we're not going to
[2:53:51] get back to the apartment
[2:53:53] tonight because they are going to shut
[2:53:55] down the
[2:53:57] streets and he didn't understand the
[2:54:00] fullness of what that means in Jerusalem
[2:54:02] when it's when they say shut down the
[2:54:04] street that's what they
[2:54:06] mean and we when we started to our
[2:54:08] apartment the concrete barriers were
[2:54:10] already put up and in the way and they
[2:54:12] were not going to let us go they were
[2:54:13] not going to let us go through the
[2:54:15] neighborhood can we leave the van here
[2:54:17] yes you can but but you'll have to pick
[2:54:19] it up at City Hall because it'll be
[2:54:21] impounded and I started
[2:54:23] pleading I jumped out of the vehicle and
[2:54:25] I'm pleading with them please this this
[2:54:27] man who's with me is an elderly man he's
[2:54:29] not feeling well he's one of the most
[2:54:31] important men I've ever known in my life
[2:54:33] if you only knew if I only had time to
[2:54:36] tell you what this man has seen in his
[2:54:38] lifetime you would gladly wave us
[2:54:40] through you'd move that barrier and let
[2:54:42] us through and they did
[2:54:45] Hallelujah so he wrote of that and we're
[2:54:48] sitting over there in an apartment and
[2:54:50] we know what's going on in the ultra
[2:54:51] Orthodox neighborhoods they're still
[2:54:53] going through some ritual and and
[2:54:55] because there's no Temple they can't
[2:54:56] kill a lamb so they've got this
[2:54:58] chicken and they've cut his throat and
[2:55:01] they're they're going through some and
[2:55:02] here we sit in the apartment and we're
[2:55:04] singing Sweet is the
[2:55:07] song I'm singing

[3:06:28] [Music]
[3:06:29] mercy oh Lord have
[3:06:33] mercy catch again this morning this
[3:06:36] afternoon what he has done on your
[3:06:40] behalf but brother Shelly I I yelled at
[3:06:43] my wife this
[3:06:45] week you shouldn't have done that
[3:06:50] you shouldn't have done
[3:06:52] that I I I snatched my children without
[3:06:56] telling them why I was bringing you
[3:06:58] shouldn't have done
[3:07:00] that I lingered too long on the on the
[3:07:04] country station when I was or rock or
[3:07:06] whatever it was when I was changing you
[3:07:08] shouldn't have done
[3:07:09] that you ought to know better than that
[3:07:13] you're not that old man anymore
[3:07:18] i i i lingered too long so something
[3:07:20] popped up on my computer and I I I
[3:07:22] lingered too long and I somehow I
[3:07:25] followed some I you ought not to have
[3:07:28] done that you're playing with your life
[3:07:31] you're playing with your marriage you're
[3:07:33] playing with your relationships when you
[3:07:35] do things like that but here is the
[3:07:37] reality of all of
[3:07:40] that you're no less a child of the
[3:07:45] king because when he paid for your sins
[3:07:48] he paid for all of
[3:07:50] them now that doesn't mean you just want
[3:07:52] to keep dibbling dabbling because this
[3:07:55] is a bride's not going to live a mixed
[3:07:57] up life she's going to come to full
[3:08:00] deliverance and she's going to manifest
[3:08:02] the life of Jesus Christ on planet Earth
[3:08:05] but don't you let your rotten things
[3:08:08] keep you from entering into the presence
[3:08:11] of the
[3:08:12] Lord It's the only thing that'll soften
[3:08:15] your old hard heart it's the only thing
[3:08:18] that'll give you a desire to live a
[3:08:19] cleaner life it's the only thing that'll
[3:08:22] make you want to turn your face and
[3:08:23] heart from the world and turn it to
[3:08:26] Jesus don't you come here under any
[3:08:29] condemnation there is therefore now no
[3:08:33] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[3:08:36] Jesus to them which are the called
[3:08:39] according to his purpose repent somebody
[3:08:43] said I already did listen uh the
[3:08:46] believer in this hour we have to say
[3:08:49] every day God forgive me I'm I'm sure I
[3:08:53] had a thought I'm sure I glanced I'm
[3:08:57] sure
[3:08:58] something it's not it's not the thing
[3:09:01] that goes in it's the thing that comes
[3:09:03] out that brings such defilement in this
[3:09:05] hour be careful what you let in because
[3:09:09] it'll come out and it'll haunt you don't
[3:09:12] let the enemy lie to you and keep you
[3:09:16] from entering in to praise him to read
[3:09:18] the word to hear the word you are not a
[3:09:22] hypocrite when you walk in humility
[3:09:24] before the Lord repenting as you go
[3:09:28] right we have so much to thank him for
[3:09:31] today and I want us to sing one more we
[3:09:34] don't usually do like this after such
[3:09:36] long preaching but I want us to sing one
[3:09:39] more because I feel like this is for
[3:09:41] somebody and if I knew who it was I
[3:09:44] would call you by name and point my long
[3:09:46] finger at you
[3:09:47] and tell you it was for you but I don't
[3:09:50] know who it's for but you will
[3:09:53] know you will know if the Lord is having
[3:09:56] us to sing this for you I want you to
[3:10:00] sing Benjamin I'm
[3:10:02] free from the fear of
[3:10:06] Tomorrow we don't know what tomorrow
[3:10:09] holds but we know who holds tomorrow and
[3:10:13] the next day and the next day and the
[3:10:14] next day how many of you are here and
[3:10:16] you'd say preacher I am facing some
[3:10:19] uncertain things in my life ahead I
[3:10:21] don't know what what it's going to look
[3:10:22] like I I don't know what some things are
[3:10:25] going to look like I don't know how it's
[3:10:27] all going to wash
[3:10:29] out but I'm throwing myself today on the
[3:10:33] mercy of a living God and I'm going to
[3:10:36] trust him when it's easy and I'm going
[3:10:38] to trust him when it's not easy I know
[3:10:42] he never
[3:10:43] fails I can tell you this he never
[3:10:48] fails for 49
[3:10:51] years of ministry and Holy Ghost baptism
[3:10:55] he has never failed me one time and I
[3:10:59] don't believe he ever will sing this
[3:11:02] Benjamin we're going to worship with you
[3:11:04] maybe you want to come and worship with
[3:11:05] us closer you're welcome if you do so
[3:11:10] long I had search for lives me
[3:11:17] if you need to renew yourself to the
[3:11:19] Lord do it to
[3:11:22] enslave by the world you need to come
[3:11:25] home to him I G do it
[3:11:29] today then the

[3:20:14] see you've obeyed the Lord Lord thank
[3:20:17] you for doing that but would you come
[3:20:18] here just a
[3:20:21] minute would you lay come over here and
[3:20:23] lay your hand on Jason's shoulder and
[3:20:28] his wife's shoulder
[3:20:31] there we're going to pray for them
[3:20:34] today you're a point of contact brother
[3:20:37] gy is already there
[3:20:38] praying for Axel but I want to tell you
[3:20:42] all something the only way that you all
[3:20:45] are going to make it
[3:20:48] is to both surrender to the
[3:20:52] Lord
[3:20:55] 100% And I know as a human there's a
[3:20:58] little fear there of what it's going to
[3:20:59] be and what it will
[3:21:01] require but I need to tell you that
[3:21:03] whatever God requires of either of you
[3:21:06] he will
[3:21:08] provide the only way that you all are
[3:21:10] going to be able to come to to a real
[3:21:12] peace and walk in real freedom is to
[3:21:15] both surrender to the Lord and all I'm
[3:21:17] going to do is ask these brothers now to
[3:21:20] pray that God will give you both
[3:21:22] Grace it's not our choice it's your
[3:21:25] choice I believe you've you've certainly
[3:21:26] tried to make the right decision in that
[3:21:29] but I'm asking the Lord and as a body
[3:21:31] we're fixing to pray a church body we're
[3:21:34] going to pray over this couple this
[3:21:37] family we're going to believe that God
[3:21:40] is going to get Glory I have believed
[3:21:43] for a long time over 20 years I have
[3:21:47] believed that God was going to get
[3:21:50] Glory out of Jason's testimony that he
[3:21:53] was going to bring him so
[3:21:56] through with such a victory that he
[3:21:59] would receive Glory from the word that
[3:22:01] come out of his mouth the grace of God
[3:22:03] that he testifies to Lord could this be
[3:22:06] the
[3:22:07] time as a body we agree right now and we
[3:22:11] didn't say that to embarrass them in any
[3:22:13] way but we said it because you pressed
[3:22:16] it on our hearts to do so and I'd rather
[3:22:20] I'd rather please you and embarrass
[3:22:22] somebody's
[3:22:23] emotion than to have to go home
[3:22:25] tormented because I didn't do what you
[3:22:27] told me to do so Lord I'm asking you
[3:22:30] right now to touch them both in the name
[3:22:33] of Jesus and give them every bit the
[3:22:36] grace they need to completely surrender
[3:22:39] to
[3:22:40] you they'll never be able to go forward
[3:22:44] one pulling one way and one pulling the
[3:22:46] next you can't plow like that Lord I'm
[3:22:52] asking you to give them the
[3:22:55] grace to fully
[3:23:00] surrender
[3:23:02] under and strengthen them as they go
[3:23:06] forward making momentary right decisions
[3:23:11] it has to be that
[3:23:13] way we just have to make the right DEC
[3:23:16] decision and keep making right
[3:23:19] decisions strengthen them to do
[3:23:22] that Lord grant the answer to Grandma's
[3:23:26] prayers and pastor's prayers that this
[3:23:31] life will be a
[3:23:34] testimony a trophy of Grace and that it
[3:23:38] will impact the rest of the children
[3:23:41] that are no longer children they now
[3:23:42] have children of Their

[3:29:56] happen and it hurts when they
[3:29:58] do but the only thing we knew to say to
[3:30:01] them was we believe that God will
[3:30:05] certainly give you a healthy baby and we
[3:30:09] believe he will and our hearts were very
[3:30:13] very excited when they came to the house
