[1:02:51] celebrating as much as they can and
[1:02:53] we're going to believe the lord and i
[1:02:55] couldn't help but notice that this
[1:02:57] friday would have been sister heice's
[1:02:58] birthday
[1:03:00] i don't believe that there are birthdays
[1:03:02] in heaven
[1:03:04] i don't i just don't think i just don't
[1:03:07] think that it's really that big of a to
[1:03:09] do
[1:03:11] i think there's so much more to be
[1:03:13] enjoying i think every day
[1:03:16] just think of the best birthday you ever
[1:03:18] had on the earth the best one
[1:03:21] and multiply that ten thousand times ten
[1:03:24] thousand that's what you're going to
[1:03:26] have every day in the presence of the
[1:03:28] lord i believe that
[1:03:30] but i couldn't help but notice that it
[1:03:32] was sister heisie's birthday on friday
[1:03:34] and we miss her and we think about her
[1:03:37] often and we pray for her family
[1:03:39] and we miss brother heichi as well
[1:03:41] they're in the presence of the lord
[1:03:43] waiting on us
[1:03:45] they're just waiting on us
[1:03:47] i saw where a friend of mine a holiness
[1:03:49] girl from
[1:03:50] oklahoma married to a holiness preacher
[1:03:55] her dad
[1:03:56] was my very good friend brother milton
[1:03:58] luke and
[1:03:59] i saw where this is the anniversary of
[1:04:02] his death
[1:04:03] and uh he passed away
[1:04:06] many years ago now
[1:04:08] preaching over here at a church in
[1:04:10] auburn he was from fredonia
[1:04:13] and
[1:04:14] he was
[1:04:15] pastoring a church but he was down
[1:04:17] preaching for a friend in in
[1:04:19] opelika auburn and finished his sermon
[1:04:22] and the lord called him home
[1:04:24] and when i saw that post of course it
[1:04:26] made me think about him and i got real
[1:04:29] excited just real excited
[1:04:33] because i know that it won't be that
[1:04:35] much longer and i'll see him again just
[1:04:38] think about that
[1:04:40] our loved ones who have died in the lord
[1:04:44] we're going to see them again
[1:04:46] and as i said last week there will be
[1:04:49] nothing between us no awkwardness
[1:04:52] there'll be nothing no bad memories
[1:04:56] it'll just be
[1:04:57] as god intended it to be in the
[1:04:59] beginning
[1:05:00] just perfection how many of you are
[1:05:02] looking forward to that
[1:05:04] well i certainly am
[1:05:06] and uh we want to give you the word we
[1:05:09] want to preach i sort of said we want to
[1:05:10] preach this morning i do
[1:05:12] because i believe the lord has laid
[1:05:14] something on my heart and i want to lay
[1:05:16] it on your heart
[1:05:17] so that you can carry it now it's your
[1:05:19] turn to carry it
[1:05:20] so let's stand again if you will
[1:05:23] let me thank god for all of these
[1:05:25] streamers
[1:05:27] wherever they're from
[1:05:29] we see some in the netherlands and
[1:05:31] indiana and zambia
[1:05:33] and uh so many more don't worry that's
[1:05:36] no problem
[1:05:38] it happens this is the life that we live
[1:05:41] these days we keep our
[1:05:42] somebody's checking on us right
[1:05:46] and uh
[1:05:48] it's usually the seniors that leave it
[1:05:50] on but that doesn't mean i couldn't do
[1:05:52] the same and doesn't mean anybody any of
[1:05:54] us couldn't but we're just glad that
[1:05:57] loved ones can get a hold of them when
[1:05:58] they need them right
[1:06:00] all of you that are streaming no matter
[1:06:02] where you're watching god bless you

[1:06:28] dear pastor shelley greetings to you
[1:06:30] your family and all our friends at new
[1:06:33] hope
[1:06:34] it has been a while since we met
[1:06:36] the last year we came over was if i
[1:06:39] remember well 2008
[1:06:41] that's a long time ago for our feelings
[1:06:44] too long ago we miss you all very much
[1:06:47] we hope and i love the way they use
[1:06:49] y'all
[1:06:52] we taught them something didn't we
[1:06:55] we miss you all very much we hope and
[1:06:57] pray that the lord will make a way for
[1:06:59] us to come over once again but of course
[1:07:02] in his will and time wouldn't that be
[1:07:04] wonderful
[1:07:06] to have them with us again speaking of
[1:07:08] time a lot of things have happened in
[1:07:10] the past years
[1:07:12] since 2009 after my dad passed away we
[1:07:15] have been serving the lord for some
[1:07:17] years
[1:07:18] at an evangelical pentecostal church in
[1:07:21] uh in the hague
[1:07:23] during that period the lord blessed us
[1:07:26] in 2011 with a second daughter sharon
[1:07:30] rose some of you may not have known that
[1:07:33] they now have the second daughter and
[1:07:35] she's just as beautiful as natanya
[1:07:38] in 2015 it was a shock when i had a
[1:07:41] heart attack and needed five bypasses
[1:07:44] but the lord is good all the time and
[1:07:47] after less than nine months i was fully
[1:07:49] recovered and since then i work full
[1:07:51] time again and do all the things i want
[1:07:54] and sometimes have to do
[1:07:57] five years ago we had the possibility to
[1:07:59] move from the hot the hague to a very
[1:08:02] small village and buy a beautiful old
[1:08:04] house since then we've been searching
[1:08:06] for a nice church to go to but as you
[1:08:08] know it's tough for an eagle to live in
[1:08:11] a barn
[1:08:15] the cry of the mother eagle pulls us
[1:08:17] again and again
[1:08:19] we learn so much from you your teaching
[1:08:21] of course but for us also the sweet love
[1:08:24] that we still experience from y'all
[1:08:27] we're so blessed to have the opportunity
[1:08:29] to attend the services every week it is
[1:08:32] a real blessing to us we love and miss
[1:08:35] you all
[1:08:36] george veronique natanya and sharon rose
[1:08:40] let's send our love back to them in the
[1:08:42] netherlands god bless you
[1:08:45] so much
[1:08:53] yes there are temporary fixes for us
[1:08:56] along the way
[1:08:58] there's a slice when we can't have a
[1:09:00] loaf
[1:09:01] but it'll never satisfy try it
[1:09:05] you try it
[1:09:07] it'll never satisfy like the word of the
[1:09:09] hour
[1:09:10] that was god's intention he did it that
[1:09:13] way for you and i
[1:09:14] are you here this morning
[1:09:17] psalm 95 verse 1 and 2.
[1:09:20] we're going to read a few of the psalms
[1:09:22] this morning i need your help

[1:09:29] singing a lot come on let's let's make
[1:09:32] sure they know how much we appreciate
[1:09:34] them
[1:09:34] [Music]
[1:09:37] they don't draw a paycheck
[1:09:39] all they get is to help enjoy the
[1:09:42] atmosphere that they create
[1:09:44] and uh your thanks goes a long way i
[1:09:47] know to encourage them
[1:09:50] to make that sacrifice of being here an
[1:09:52] hour before the service and
[1:09:54] and playing sometime when they'd like to
[1:09:56] be down worshiping with you we love them
[1:09:58] and appreciate them oh come
[1:10:01] let us sing unto the lord
[1:10:04] let us make a joyful
[1:10:07] noise
[1:10:08] to the rock
[1:10:10] of our
[1:10:11] salvation
[1:10:13] let us come before his presence
[1:10:16] with thanksgiving
[1:10:18] and make a joyful noise unto him
[1:10:23] with
[1:10:24] psalms
[1:10:25] with
[1:10:26] songs
[1:10:28] oh come let us sing unto the lord
[1:10:31] let us make a joyful noise
[1:10:34] to the rock
[1:10:36] of our salvation
[1:10:38] i don't know what you think about when
[1:10:39] you think about noise but i think of
[1:10:42] something
[1:10:43] that has some volume to it
[1:10:45] so don't criticize us if we get a little
[1:10:48] loud
[1:10:50] eternity is going to be louder than this
[1:10:53] whichever place you end up
[1:10:56] psalm 98 but i believe you're you're
[1:10:59] going with me and i'm going to uh to a
[1:11:01] happy place for sure
[1:11:03] but i my old granny used to say this
[1:11:06] earth is the quietest place you'll ever
[1:11:08] live
[1:11:10] psalm 98
[1:11:11] verses 4 through 8
[1:11:13] says something quite similar
[1:11:16] make a joyful noise unto the lord all
[1:11:20] the earth
[1:11:21] make a loud noise
[1:11:24] and rejoice
[1:11:26] and
[1:11:28] sing praise hallelujah
[1:11:31] sing unto the lord with the harp
[1:11:35] with the harp and the voice
[1:11:38] of a psalm
[1:11:40] with trumpets and sound of cornet make a
[1:11:44] joyful
[1:11:45] noise before the lord
[1:11:48] the king i don't know if you know
[1:11:50] anything about a trumpet but it is a job
[1:11:53] to make that trumpet uh volume be low
[1:11:58] it takes a muffle and it takes some work
[1:12:01] because when you blow a trumpet i'm
[1:12:03] telling you it's a loud instrument
[1:12:07] let the sea roar
[1:12:10] and the fullness thereof
[1:12:12] the world and they that dwell
[1:12:16] therein
[1:12:17] let the floods clap their hands
[1:12:21] let the heels
[1:12:23] be joyful
[1:12:25] together
[1:12:26] psalm 100
[1:12:29] verse 1 through 5
[1:12:32] says something quite similar
[1:12:34] make a joyful noise unto the lord
[1:12:38] all ye lands
[1:12:41] serve the lord with gladness
[1:12:44] come before
[1:12:45] his presence with
[1:12:48] singing
[1:12:49] sometimes people say oh they sure do
[1:12:52] sing a lot
[1:12:57] we're just obeying the word
[1:13:00] know ye that the lord he is god
[1:13:04] it is he that hath made us
[1:13:07] and not we ourselves
[1:13:10] we are his people
[1:13:12] and the sheep of his pasture
[1:13:16] isn't that good to know
[1:13:18] enter
[1:13:21] don't wait till the music gets you
[1:13:23] worked up
[1:13:24] enter into his gates with thanksgiving
[1:13:28] and into his courts with praise be
[1:13:32] thankful unto him and
[1:13:35] bless his name
[1:13:39] for the lord is good
[1:13:42] his mercy
[1:13:44] is everlasting
[1:13:47] and his truth endureth to all
[1:13:52] generations
[1:13:53] psalm 105
[1:13:55] verse 43 i know you're still standing
[1:14:00] and he brought forth
[1:14:02] his people
[1:14:05] and he brought forth
[1:14:08] his people
[1:14:10] with
[1:14:11] joy
[1:14:13] psalm 105
[1:14:14] verse 43.
[1:14:16] he brought forth his people with joy
[1:14:21] and his chosen
[1:14:22] with
[1:14:24] gladness
[1:14:26] one more before you're seated psalm 63 5
[1:14:30] my soul
[1:14:32] shall be satisfied
[1:14:35] as with marrow
[1:14:37] and fatness
[1:14:39] and my
[1:14:40] mouth shall praise thee
[1:14:48] with joyful
[1:14:50] lips
[1:14:52] there's a lot of things that come out of
[1:14:54] our lips
[1:14:56] that are not joyful
[1:14:58] what a great grand privilege to be able
[1:15:02] to offer god praise
[1:15:05] with lips
[1:15:06] that are filled with joy
[1:15:09] did you know your lips can have joy
[1:15:12] joyful
[1:15:14] lips
[1:15:15] that word is mana
[1:15:17] and it means ringing out a cry or a
[1:15:21] shout for joy so it is a it it really
[1:15:26] means
[1:15:27] shouting lips
[1:15:29] lips that shout with joy
[1:15:32] and shouting is not always quiet
[1:15:35] sometimes the shout of the king
[1:15:38] gets to moving in our midst and we are
[1:15:41] not ashamed to be a little louder than
[1:15:43] we would know it's not a funeral
[1:15:48] i streamed just a little bit of sister
[1:15:51] mother hayton's funeral yesterday she
[1:15:53] was a dear saint of god brother and
[1:15:56] sister greeley were there at that
[1:15:57] funeral and i was able to stream a
[1:16:00] little of it and i i knew that family
[1:16:02] for 30 years
[1:16:04] and i saw them the last time at sister
[1:16:07] carol kinser's funeral
[1:16:09] and sister hayden or she must have been
[1:16:11] about 87 or 88 but i want you to know
[1:16:15] that wasn't a very quiet funeral
[1:16:18] there was some real praising the lord
[1:16:21] there because somebody must have caught
[1:16:24] in their mind an image of her entering
[1:16:27] into that rest that she'd been working
[1:16:29] toward
[1:16:30] seeing her husband and the saints of god
[1:16:33] gathered around waiting on her arrival
[1:16:36] and that would make anybody want to be a
[1:16:37] little loud wouldn't it
[1:16:39] let's bow our heads for a moment of
[1:16:41] prayer
[1:16:42] father we cannot express enough
[1:16:44] how how much we love you
[1:16:47] how thankful we are that you love us
[1:16:50] i want to thank you for help and
[1:16:52] strength to get to the house of god
[1:16:54] today to praise you
[1:16:57] i'm like everybody else here we have our
[1:16:59] own aches and pains and we have our own
[1:17:02] symptoms that nag
[1:17:04] but i am so thankful to be able to lift
[1:17:07] up my hands and give you glory and honor
[1:17:10] and praise i'm not ashamed to praise you
[1:17:13] in this house and i'm not ashamed for
[1:17:16] that praise to go all over the world by
[1:17:18] the internet because we're here on
[1:17:21] business for the king today
[1:17:23] and we make no apology for entering into
[1:17:26] that presence for in your presence o god
[1:17:30] there is fullness of joy
[1:17:32] our joy has been made full today because
[1:17:36] you have honored us
[1:17:38] you've graced us with your tangible
[1:17:41] presence
[1:17:42] and we want to give you praise and honor
[1:17:44] and glory for it bless our time in the
[1:17:46] word give us hearts to hear
[1:17:49] help your servant to deliver and we'll
[1:17:52] give you glory and honor and praise for
[1:17:54] it's in the name of the lord jesus
[1:17:56] christ we pray and the saints said
[1:17:59] you may be seated god bless you god
[1:18:02] bless brother greeley today
[1:18:06] preaching for brother
[1:18:09] darren kinser this morning
[1:18:11] preaching this evening for brother
[1:18:13] david farmer before they
[1:18:16] head home tomorrow may god just give
[1:18:18] them glorious services that's been our
[1:18:21] prayer
[1:18:23] so i want to preach on joy
[1:18:26] we started last week
[1:18:28] about
[1:18:29] from hebrews
[1:18:32] thinking about the joy that caused our
[1:18:35] lord to go all the way through
[1:18:37] he didn't fail us because he caught a
[1:18:39] glimpse of you and i
[1:18:41] in his image
[1:18:43] changed by the power
[1:18:45] of redemption
[1:18:47] and so he endured the cross
[1:18:50] holding on even though he despised the
[1:18:52] shame involved that joy of seeing you
[1:18:56] and i in his likeness
[1:18:58] overcoming in the last age
[1:19:01] it gave him strength that he needed to
[1:19:03] go all the way
[1:19:05] on our behalf
[1:19:07] today i if i were to title what i want
[1:19:09] to share i would call it choosing joy
[1:19:13] as a strategic position
[1:19:16] joy is a choice
[1:19:19] and joy is a strategy
[1:19:22] and joy is a strategic position
[1:19:26] joy is not based on condition
[1:19:29] it's based on
[1:19:31] position
[1:19:32] it's a placing
[1:19:34] we are placed as sons
[1:19:37] we can be placed in joy
[1:19:40] we can choose to remain
[1:19:43] in the place of joy
[1:19:46] no matter what is happening around us
[1:19:49] now don't tell me that nobody knows what
[1:19:52] you're going through because somebody
[1:19:54] somewhere has walked a similar road
[1:19:57] and if they overcame they overcame by
[1:20:00] choosing joy
[1:20:01] they overcame by maintaining a testimony
[1:20:05] in the midst of a lot of heartache and a
[1:20:07] lot of hurt and a lot of suffering and
[1:20:10] some hard trials and some hot flames but
[1:20:14] they made it through by the grace of god
[1:20:16] because
[1:20:17] somebody always will
[1:20:20] when it looks like remember i used to
[1:20:22] preach this message around when i
[1:20:23] traveled
[1:20:24] when it looked like nobody would
[1:20:26] somebody did
[1:20:29] and somebody always will in the book of
[1:20:32] job it was only one survivor to come and
[1:20:35] tell the story but no matter how bad the
[1:20:37] storm was no matter how bad the plague
[1:20:40] was no matter how many died god always
[1:20:43] made sure that somebody came through it
[1:20:48] as an overcomer as a survivor to be able
[1:20:51] to testify what they had walked through
[1:20:54] and you and i are those survivors we are
[1:20:56] those overcomers
[1:20:58] who will have a testimony unlike any
[1:21:01] from any other age
[1:21:04] because we were chosen to live in the
[1:21:06] last of the last days
[1:21:09] we were placed here in god's mind it was
[1:21:12] not a mistake
[1:21:13] he could have sown you into any
[1:21:16] generation into any church age but he
[1:21:19] chose for you to be born in laodicea
[1:21:23] and he chose for you to hear the last
[1:21:27] message that god was going to send to
[1:21:30] prepare an overcoming bride
[1:21:32] he let you have ears to hear and eyes to
[1:21:36] see
[1:21:37] that is the goodness of god look around
[1:21:40] you and you will recognize that you are
[1:21:42] a minority
[1:21:45] in this world you are a minority but as
[1:21:48] the old song said
[1:21:50] god one man and god
[1:21:54] one man and god can try him for a
[1:21:56] thousand
[1:21:58] come on one man and god put satan on the
[1:22:01] run
[1:22:02] so take courage weary pilgrim
[1:22:05] one man and god can win the victory and
[1:22:08] i believe it what is joy
[1:22:11] well mr webster says that joy is the
[1:22:15] emotion evoked
[1:22:17] by well-being
[1:22:20] by success
[1:22:22] or good fortune
[1:22:25] or by the prospect
[1:22:27] of possessing
[1:22:28] what one desires
[1:22:31] that definition for me
[1:22:34] leaves something lacking
[1:22:36] because i don't believe that joy is
[1:22:38] based on success
[1:22:41] i don't believe that joy is based on
[1:22:43] good fortune
[1:22:44] i don't believe that joy is based on the
[1:22:47] prospect of possessing what you desire
[1:22:50] i think there's a whole lot more to joy
[1:22:52] than that don't you
[1:22:54] to the people who know jesus
[1:22:56] to those who are true believers these
[1:22:59] definitions might
[1:23:01] might be to those who don't know the
[1:23:03] lord those definitions might be true but
[1:23:06] to the true christian
[1:23:08] something different applies as it
[1:23:11] relates to joy
[1:23:12] you've heard of wikipedia haven't you
[1:23:15] it's not the most reliable source of
[1:23:17] research on the internet because anybody
[1:23:19] can
[1:23:20] alter it and change it and doctor it and
[1:23:23] fix it it's a conglomeration of of
[1:23:25] contributors
[1:23:27] well theology has one i don't know if
[1:23:29] you knew that or not it's called
[1:23:31] fieldpedia
[1:23:32] and
[1:23:33] does a little bit better in describing
[1:23:36] joy it more convincingly says that it's
[1:23:39] a state of mind
[1:23:42] it's an orientation of the heart
[1:23:45] position
[1:23:47] it's turning your heart in a right
[1:23:49] direction not based on success or
[1:23:51] prosperity but based on what you know
[1:23:55] what you know that you know that you
[1:23:56] know that you know that you know joy is
[1:23:59] not about what you think
[1:24:01] it's not about how you feel
[1:24:03] joy is about what you know that you know
[1:24:06] that you know that you know can you say
[1:24:08] amen
[1:24:09] it's a settle state
[1:24:11] of contentment
[1:24:13] confidence
[1:24:14] and hope
[1:24:15] it is something or someone that provides
[1:24:18] a source
[1:24:20] of happiness
[1:24:22] joy is a strong
[1:24:24] feeling of happiness a manifestation of
[1:24:27] happiness through an outward rejoicing
[1:24:30] or excitement
[1:24:32] one contributor said joy is not joy
[1:24:37] unless it's expressed
[1:24:42] you can be happy have you ever have you
[1:24:45] ever met somebody who everything was
[1:24:47] going all right and they still look like
[1:24:49] they've been sucking on a sour lemon
[1:24:52] have you ever wanted to say to somebody
[1:24:53] would you just notify your face
[1:24:56] i've had people look with us i'm not
[1:24:58] going to call names
[1:25:01] but i wouldn't have to throw very far to
[1:25:03] hit some of you
[1:25:06] i'm happy brother shelly
[1:25:09] i'm i'm just as happy as i can be
[1:25:14] sometimes they they ought to sing to
[1:25:16] them the old sunday school song you
[1:25:18] ought to stay with me if you can't help
[1:25:20] me in the beginning don't help me at the
[1:25:21] end
[1:25:22] i need you now
[1:25:26] you got something more interesting to
[1:25:27] read there just go right ahead
[1:25:29] but don't you get happy at the end
[1:25:32] that's how i feel sometime
[1:25:35] have you ever just wanted to sing
[1:25:36] somebody the little children song if
[1:25:38] you're happy and you know it
[1:25:43] clap your hands
[1:25:45] stomp your feet
[1:25:47] notify your face
[1:25:50] come on
[1:25:52] i said one contributor said that joy is
[1:25:54] not really joy unless you find a way to
[1:25:57] let it out
[1:25:59] unless you find a way to express it and
[1:26:02] i i believe that i i believe that that a
[1:26:05] great portion of joy is in the ability
[1:26:09] to express
[1:26:11] that contentment that god that deep
[1:26:14] knowing that god has placed on the
[1:26:17] inside of you and to be able to express
[1:26:20] that in a world of change and in a world
[1:26:24] that that is all over the place
[1:26:25] emotionally but to be able to be in the
[1:26:28] heat of a trial like paul and silas and
[1:26:31] still let the joy belts ring in your
[1:26:35] praise to me that's joy
[1:26:38] for you to jump around when everything's
[1:26:40] going good that's happy
[1:26:42] but if you can jump around when the when
[1:26:45] the ship is sinking
[1:26:49] when the washing machine gives up
[1:26:52] when the brakes give out
[1:26:54] when the tire is flat
[1:26:56] when people talk about you and
[1:26:58] misunderstand and misrepresent you
[1:27:02] but you can rejoice any way that's joy
[1:27:06] that's joy
[1:27:08] hallelujah
[1:27:09] jesus said we're told in scripture leave
[1:27:12] for joy
[1:27:14] when men will revile you and persecute
[1:27:17] you and cause you problems so so joy
[1:27:21] is an emotion
[1:27:23] but it's more like a deep abiding
[1:27:27] peace
[1:27:28] and happiness and thrill because you
[1:27:33] have set your heart toward a truth
[1:27:37] an absolute
[1:27:39] truth
[1:27:40] a truth that never changes
[1:27:44] no matter what age is presented no
[1:27:47] matter what circumstances it comes we
[1:27:49] set our heart
[1:27:51] toward a truth
[1:27:53] and no matter what the enemy says or
[1:27:56] does we keep it set if the enemy tries
[1:27:59] to pull us out of that place just real
[1:28:01] quickly we turn the knob we turn the
[1:28:04] dial we dial back to joy come on
[1:28:08] this is how we overcome
[1:28:11] remember the bible said the joy of the
[1:28:13] lord
[1:28:15] the joy of the lord
[1:28:19] the joy of the lord
[1:28:21] is my strength
[1:28:23] the word joy appears 88 times in the old
[1:28:27] testament in 22 books
[1:28:30] the word joy appears 57 times in the new
[1:28:34] testament in 18 of the book so joy
[1:28:38] and rejoice
[1:28:40] is covered
[1:28:41] throughout the scripture
[1:28:43] joy and rejoicing is mentioned 19 times
[1:28:48] in the book of philippians alone
[1:28:52] sometimes theologians will say that
[1:28:55] philippians is paul's joy book
[1:28:58] it's a book that's written about joy and
[1:29:02] i don't have time this was just a little
[1:29:04] outline that i put together to get ready
[1:29:06] for what we were going to share don't
[1:29:08] have time to go through every detail but
[1:29:10] philippians 1 says to have joy in
[1:29:12] circumstances philippians 2 tells us to
[1:29:15] experience joy in serving philippians 3
[1:29:19] tells us to be joyful by having faith
[1:29:22] philippians 4 there's only four chapters
[1:29:24] i think know what joy is like while
[1:29:28] giving of yourself experience the joy of
[1:29:31] giving of yourself
[1:29:33] philippians 3 1
[1:29:36] let's read that in the complete jewish
[1:29:38] bible that's how i gave it to you there
[1:29:40] ladies
[1:29:41] in conclusion
[1:29:43] my brothers

[1:31:35] in union with the lord always
[1:31:39] i
[1:31:40] will say it again
[1:31:42] rejoice now when you read something in
[1:31:45] the bible how many of you like to go
[1:31:47] back and find a little bit about the
[1:31:49] back story of why you're reading what
[1:31:51] you're reading if you don't do that then
[1:31:54] you're just scratching the surface of
[1:31:56] scripture
[1:31:57] if you want to know what's really being
[1:31:59] spoken you got to go back and don't just
[1:32:01] take a memory verse out but go back and
[1:32:04] find out the content and the context of
[1:32:08] of the verses before and the verses
[1:32:11] after we're talking about the apostle
[1:32:13] paul
[1:32:14] he's living now not in prison but under
[1:32:17] what we would call house arrest he can't
[1:32:20] go anywhere on his own he is spending
[1:32:23] now ten years
[1:32:25] a prisoner
[1:32:27] under house arrest his missionary
[1:32:30] journeys of going here and there and
[1:32:33] everywhere have been curtailed and he is
[1:32:36] being held in one spot and philippians
[1:32:40] think about this philippians is one of
[1:32:43] the books that he writes when he is
[1:32:46] under 10 years of house arrest and what
[1:32:49] does he say
[1:32:51] moan and groan because life isn't fair
[1:32:58] no he said rejoice
[1:33:01] you are in union with the lord always i
[1:33:05] will say it again
[1:33:09] [Music]
[1:33:10] i want you to know paul was the poster
[1:33:13] boy for having hard times
[1:33:16] he was a glorious glowing example of
[1:33:19] what it meant to be persecuted
[1:33:22] and beaten and mistreated and held
[1:33:25] captive in fact he could have been
[1:33:27] bitter
[1:33:30] because he knew his destiny
[1:33:34] he wasn't like some of us still trying
[1:33:37] to figure out why we're here
[1:33:39] paul knew
[1:33:40] beyond the shadow of a doubt that he had
[1:33:43] been raised up as an apostle
[1:33:47] he had been called brother branham said
[1:33:50] as a setter in order
[1:33:52] brother branham define
[1:33:54] apostle as one who sets things in order
[1:33:59] and this was the ministry of paul how
[1:34:02] can you go and visit the churches and
[1:34:05] set deacons in place
[1:34:08] and elders in place and bishops in place
[1:34:12] or pastors we call them now how can you
[1:34:15] do that if you are held in one place a
[1:34:19] prisoner for 10 years i want you to know
[1:34:22] he could have been bitter toward the
[1:34:24] government bitter toward the authorities
[1:34:27] he could have been bitter toward the
[1:34:29] devil he could have called everybody his
[1:34:32] enemy and he could have said everybody
[1:34:34] is out to stop me nobody wants me to be
[1:34:38] what god has called me to be think about
[1:34:40] it i've been beaten and whipped and
[1:34:42] shipwrecked and thrown snake bitten i've
[1:34:44] been this and that and the other and and
[1:34:47] i'm having a terrible time and nobody
[1:34:49] seems to know just how bad it really is
[1:34:54] and i'm not to blame
[1:34:57] i didn't do this
[1:34:59] this isn't my fault
[1:35:01] this is what's being done to me but you
[1:35:03] know what i don't find one verse
[1:35:08] not one verse in all the writings of the
[1:35:11] epistles the letters to the churches of
[1:35:14] the apostle paul he just said if i can't
[1:35:16] go i'll send them a letter
[1:35:19] it'd be like you and i saying today if i
[1:35:21] can't go physically i'll send them an
[1:35:23] email
[1:35:24] i'll shoot them a text
[1:35:26] but i will do what god has called me to
[1:35:30] do and that is to encourage the churches
[1:35:33] and to set them in order for the coming
[1:35:35] of the lord
[1:35:37] not only did he do that but god used his
[1:35:41] imprisonment and his house arrest god
[1:35:45] used it to preserve the messages that he
[1:35:49] was to give to the church
[1:35:52] if paul would have been able to always
[1:35:55] go to philippi
[1:35:57] if he would have always been able to go
[1:35:59] to colossae if he would have always been
[1:36:01] able to go to corinth or to thessalonica
[1:36:05] he could have preached under the
[1:36:07] inspiration and unction of the holy
[1:36:10] spirit but there were no tape recordings
[1:36:14] no one could have moved as fast as paul
[1:36:17] was preaching
[1:36:19] and just so you'll know
[1:36:21] he was a long-winded
[1:36:24] preacher
[1:36:28] i was going to preach this morning
[1:36:31] getting joy after a fall
[1:36:33] but i'll preach that another time
[1:36:36] i started on that about monday and
[1:36:38] tuesday studying
[1:36:39] and then i thought no no no i got to get
[1:36:41] something else we'll come back to that
[1:36:42] later getting joy after a fall because
[1:36:45] you know he was leaving the next morning
[1:36:48] and he had a lot to get in
[1:36:51] he had no idea when he would be there
[1:36:52] the next time so the bible said he
[1:36:55] preached till midnight
[1:36:57] in fact we've got every reason to
[1:36:58] believe he would have never stopped at
[1:37:00] midnight had someone not died and
[1:37:02] interrupted the whole service
[1:37:04] fell out the window fell asleep sunk to
[1:37:07] sleep fell out the window and died
[1:37:10] and the whole service had to stop
[1:37:12] to raise the young man from the dead
[1:37:14] and oh what joy
[1:37:16] read it for yourself what a joy it cost
[1:37:20] oh nobody was mad because the service
[1:37:22] got interrupted it was an opportunity
[1:37:24] for the power of god to be demonstrated
[1:37:27] he'd preached all night and would have
[1:37:29] kept on preaching had it not happened
[1:37:31] like this
[1:37:32] so he was a long-winded preacher and
[1:37:34] they would have never been able to write
[1:37:36] it all down
[1:37:37] but because god allowed him to be under
[1:37:39] house arrest and for a period of time
[1:37:42] prison imprisoned in a pit
[1:37:46] i've been to amber teen prison in rome
[1:37:49] i've seen down in the pit where the
[1:37:51] apostle paul wrote letters to the
[1:37:53] churches
[1:37:54] i've seen that little hole of light
[1:37:57] just a little hole
[1:37:58] where a little bit of light would come
[1:38:00] in in the daytime
[1:38:01] and at night there was no light
[1:38:04] it's more like a dungeon
[1:38:06] it was a place for prisoners to be
[1:38:08] tormented and i've looked down in there
[1:38:10] i want you to know something you shame
[1:38:13] on you i'm gonna get a little stirred
[1:38:14] here shame on you for that dusty bible
[1:38:19] somebody help me preach a little bit
[1:38:21] shame on you for that dusty bible
[1:38:23] shame on you if the only time you pick
[1:38:25] up your bible is on a sunday morning or
[1:38:28] a tuesday night let me tell you
[1:38:30] something he risked everything
[1:38:33] and suffered all things to be able to
[1:38:36] give us the word of the lord and had he
[1:38:38] not been under house arrest he would
[1:38:40] have just continued to go go go and had
[1:38:43] he not been in prison he would have just
[1:38:44] gone and those precious words would have
[1:38:47] never been recorded but because he
[1:38:49] couldn't get there he wrote them some
[1:38:52] believe with the help of a scribe
[1:38:54] because they believe his eyesight was
[1:38:55] poor i don't know i don't know if it was
[1:38:58] penned with his own hand sometime he
[1:38:59] said it was i don't know if it was all
[1:39:01] penned by his own hand i don't know all
[1:39:03] those details but i know that god
[1:39:06] allowed those letters to be written
[1:39:08] because you and i are still benefiting
[1:39:12] when we see the suffering of paul and
[1:39:14] instead of hearing his bitterness and
[1:39:17] his complaints and blaming everybody
[1:39:19] else because nobody will let him do what
[1:39:22] he was called to do
[1:39:24] we hear him saying hey rejoice
[1:39:31] read john do it again
[1:39:34] do joy again choose joy again
[1:39:37] i don't care how hard it is out there in
[1:39:41] in philippi
[1:39:43] i don't care how bad it gets over there
[1:39:45] in thessalonica rejoice
[1:39:48] and again i say rejoice
[1:39:52] because joy is not about your condition
[1:39:56] it's about your position
[1:39:58] it's about choosing to keep your heart
[1:40:01] and mind stayed on god's truth and what
[1:40:06] god has promised to you as an overcomer
[1:40:09] paul could boldly tell people to rejoice
[1:40:13] as he used himself as a prime example he
[1:40:17] was full of joy because he knew that no
[1:40:20] matter what happened to him outwardly
[1:40:24] jesus christ
[1:40:28] [Music]
[1:40:32] how can somebody rejoice
[1:40:35] under the shadow
[1:40:36] of the c word
[1:40:44] the prophet told us clearly
[1:40:47] do not
[1:40:48] fear cancer
[1:40:52] well if you're not going to fear it what
[1:40:53] are you going to do rejoice
[1:40:58] and again i say
[1:41:00] rejoice
[1:41:03] because god is good
[1:41:06] in the slim times in the abundant times
[1:41:10] god is good
[1:41:12] he's worthy to be praised when you feel
[1:41:14] good and when you feel
[1:41:16] lousy i'm not even preaching on praise
[1:41:21] but how can you express joy
[1:41:27] sitting on your hands
[1:41:31] through the years
[1:41:33] there have always been those who would
[1:41:34] say things like i don't like for church
[1:41:36] to feel like a a cheerleading time
[1:41:40] somebody telling me raise your hand
[1:41:42] stand up sit down kneel down run around
[1:41:46] i just don't like to be told what to do
[1:41:48] you've made that abundantly clear
[1:41:54] through the years it has been made
[1:41:56] abundantly clear to me
[1:41:58] that there are just some people that
[1:42:00] don't want to be even a strong
[1:42:02] suggestion of what they might do
[1:42:04] differently than what they're doing
[1:42:06] right now
[1:42:07] come on now
[1:42:08] but i mark those folk in my mind
[1:42:11] and i watch them from time to time and i
[1:42:13] have all the way through the years
[1:42:15] and i wait to see if they ever do it
[1:42:17] without being told
[1:42:23] and you know what you find out
[1:42:25] so many times unless they're reminded
[1:42:28] unless they're encouraged unless they're
[1:42:31] instructed unless they're exhorted to
[1:42:34] praise him they sit like a bump on a
[1:42:36] pickle
[1:42:37] [Music]
[1:42:39] don't you let it get quiet
[1:42:41] even if you're one of those
[1:42:44] even if you're like a bump on a pickle
[1:42:46] don't you be quiet now now's your time
[1:42:50] to say hey i can't help what i was but i
[1:42:52] don't have to be that anymore rejoice
[1:42:57] and again i say
[1:42:59] rejoice
[1:43:03] if paul could i can
[1:43:06] if paul could you can
[1:43:10] whoo
[1:43:13] they asked my granny sister shelly how
[1:43:14] do you feel i'm blessed
[1:43:18] i'm blessed
[1:43:20] she took one one or two
[1:43:23] radiation treatments and decided i can't
[1:43:25] take any more of that
[1:43:28] god still gave her a few years on the
[1:43:30] end of her life
[1:43:31] and she used every day of that
[1:43:34] and every moment of that to give god
[1:43:36] praise and to give god glory
[1:43:39] because she had been both a pastor and a
[1:43:41] businesswoman in the community the
[1:43:43] newspaper come out and did a big article
[1:43:46] i have a copy of it somewhere did a big
[1:43:48] article in the ledger inquirer
[1:43:51] about her life and about what she was
[1:43:52] going through
[1:43:54] and and part of the headlines is
[1:43:57] i'm blessed
[1:44:00] i'm blessed
[1:44:02] it's the testimony she gave to every
[1:44:04] person who came and sat across the desk
[1:44:06] from her right up until the year of her
[1:44:08] death she did income tax did him into
[1:44:10] the wee hours of the morning
[1:44:13] i've carried her a drink of water or
[1:44:15] drink of tea or something like that out
[1:44:17] to her desk at one o'clock in the
[1:44:19] morning with a whole lobby full of
[1:44:22] people waiting to get their tax done
[1:44:23] they'd been waiting since getting off
[1:44:25] work time there were people that came
[1:44:27] from everywhere from from out of state
[1:44:30] john kilpatrick the pastor of
[1:44:31] brownsville revival drove every year
[1:44:35] from pensacola florida to sit across the
[1:44:38] desk for my grandmother to do his tax we
[1:44:41] weren't stupid
[1:44:43] we knew there were greater accountants
[1:44:45] she wasn't even an accountant she was
[1:44:47] just a tax preparer
[1:44:48] we knew there were people that could do
[1:44:50] as good of a job as she could
[1:44:53] they didn't come because of that
[1:44:56] they came because they knew they were
[1:44:58] going to get a testimony with their
[1:44:59] papers
[1:45:01] they knew they were going to get a
[1:45:03] praise of the lord hallelujah
[1:45:05] and i knew that if i was there i was
[1:45:08] going to get a holler she was going to
[1:45:09] scream at the top of her lungs steve
[1:45:16] and i would go rushing out to see what
[1:45:17] she needed and she said she needs prayer
[1:45:24] i'd pray
[1:45:26] when i'd get through praying i'd say is
[1:45:28] that all
[1:45:29] and she'd say no
[1:45:31] said uh he needs prayer too
[1:45:34] he was telling me he has such-and-such
[1:45:36] now go pray for him and she'd just go
[1:45:38] right back
[1:45:39] they knew it was going to be a little
[1:45:40] bit of tax preparation and a little bit
[1:45:42] of church and even as i said the last
[1:45:45] text season she did they would say how
[1:45:47] do you feel miss shelley or sister
[1:45:49] shelley she'd say i'm blessed i can't
[1:45:52] complain i'm so blessed even though
[1:45:55] breath was getting shorter
[1:46:00] pressure was getting a little tighter
[1:46:01] and pain was getting a little more
[1:46:03] severe she learned
[1:46:05] you get a whole lot more out of joy
[1:46:10] then you do grieving
[1:46:12] you get a whole lot more out of setting
[1:46:14] up your mind to get back to joy
[1:46:18] to return to joy
[1:46:21] because joy is not about your condition
[1:46:24] it's about your position anybody with me
[1:46:27] joy joy joy joy and you know what there
[1:46:30] is a joy
[1:46:31] that is of a divine origin
[1:46:34] joy is an emotion it can even be a human
[1:46:37] emotion according to webster's
[1:46:38] dictionary if things are going good you
[1:46:40] can you can have a little joy worked up
[1:46:42] inside but there is a joy
[1:46:45] it doesn't originate with you
[1:46:48] it doesn't originate with me
[1:46:51] it's not a product of what i can squeeze
[1:46:53] together
[1:46:54] show i feel like
[1:46:58] no no no no no it's a gift
[1:47:00] it's a divine origin
[1:47:03] and it gives me strength when i'm weak
[1:47:07] somebody said what do you call that joy
[1:47:09] the joy of the lord his joy
[1:47:16] i preached to you last sunday what
[1:47:18] brought him joy
[1:47:20] that's the joy that he infuses into our
[1:47:22] lives
[1:47:24] that same joy
[1:47:25] to keep us pressing on
[1:47:27] sister zoe can you give me nehemiah
[1:47:29] chapter 8
[1:47:31] verses 1 through 10.
[1:47:33] i'm going to get down here to a verse
[1:47:35] where there's a lot of pronunciation
[1:47:37] i can do it
[1:47:39] might not be right
[1:47:41] but i can do it
[1:47:44] but i'm going to skip it
[1:47:46] and all the people gathered themselves
[1:47:48] together as one man into the street that
[1:47:52] was before the watergate
[1:47:54] and they spake unto ezra the scribe
[1:47:57] to bring the book
[1:48:00] of the law
[1:48:01] of moses
[1:48:05] which the lord had commanded to israel
[1:48:08] are you still with me that is verse one
[1:48:10] now verse two
[1:48:12] and ezra the priests
[1:48:15] i know that i know that you have these i
[1:48:17] gave them to you this morning
[1:48:19] and ezra the priest brought the law
[1:48:22] before the congregation
[1:48:25] both of men and women
[1:48:27] and all that could hear with
[1:48:30] understanding upon the first day of the
[1:48:33] seventh month
[1:48:34] and he read therein before the street
[1:48:38] that was before the watergate
[1:48:41] from the morning
[1:48:44] until
[1:48:50] i like to spiritualize when i can
[1:48:58] you want to get out by 12.
[1:49:01] that's not the biblical order
[1:49:06] the biblical precedent is he was reading
[1:49:09] the law
[1:49:11] from the morning until midday
[1:49:18] from about 11 to 2
[1:49:21] maybe a little longer
[1:49:25] we need it sometime
[1:49:27] before the watergate from the morning of
[1:49:29] the midday before the men and the women
[1:49:32] and those that could understand
[1:49:34] and the ears of all here here's your
[1:49:37] part
[1:49:38] here is your part
[1:49:40] i do my part by studying all week
[1:49:43] i do my part by praying
[1:49:46] hearing trying to hear from the lord
[1:49:49] i have prepared
[1:49:50] hundreds of sermons that have never been
[1:49:52] preached
[1:49:53] because you get carried away in a study
[1:49:56] and you think that that's going to be
[1:49:57] what we need and the lord comes along
[1:50:00] and gives you something else and you put
[1:50:02] that back somewhere in a file and never
[1:50:04] get to it
[1:50:05] i don't consider that a waste of my time
[1:50:09] i consider that a part of who i am to be
[1:50:11] able to study god's word to be able to
[1:50:14] read to be able to research to be able
[1:50:15] to pray
[1:50:16] i don't know about you but i love it
[1:50:18] when god places something on our hearts
[1:50:20] like that
[1:50:22] i went to bed last night and as soon as
[1:50:24] i closed my eyes
[1:50:26] i was not asleep i couldn't have
[1:50:28] possibly been asleep but as soon as i
[1:50:30] closed my eyes i saw a name written in
[1:50:33] cursive writing
[1:50:35] right out across the sky
[1:50:37] right across my vision it was the name
[1:50:40] bobby b-o-b-b-y
[1:50:44] i opened my eyes and i could see bobby
[1:50:46] was still written there
[1:50:48] in my room just right out in my vision
[1:50:51] and i said i don't know who bobby is i
[1:50:53] didn't get a face sometime i get a face
[1:50:55] you do too i didn't get a face i just
[1:50:58] got a name b-o-b-b-y didn't even know if
[1:51:01] it you know even a woman could be called
[1:51:02] bobby it could be a nickname it didn't
[1:51:04] have to be a name it could be just a
[1:51:06] nickname it could be a robert it could
[1:51:07] be a bomb could be a lot of things
[1:51:09] b-o-b-b-y
[1:51:11] i prayed for every bobby
[1:51:14] that i could think of
[1:51:16] i prayed for bobby duke i prayed for
[1:51:19] bobby wurtz
[1:51:22] i prayed for bobby meeks
[1:51:25] i started letting my mind go through
[1:51:27] every body that i'd ever met and then i
[1:51:29] said lord i don't feel peace on any of
[1:51:32] that so i'm just going to pray for all
[1:51:34] the bobbies i don't know
[1:51:38] i i i mentioned it this morning to
[1:51:40] olivia because she said she didn't sleep
[1:51:42] very well i said i didn't sleep much at
[1:51:44] all but about 10 minutes at a time
[1:51:47] through the night because i kept
[1:51:48] thinking about who bobby is
[1:51:51] and praying for bobby and i thought i
[1:51:52] may get to church and somebody might
[1:51:54] request prayer somebody might say i know
[1:51:57] a bobby that stands in need of prayer it
[1:51:59] really doesn't matter
[1:52:01] it really doesn't matter what matters is
[1:52:03] if god gives us a little something like
[1:52:05] that what a privilege
[1:52:07] what a privilege
[1:52:09] i don't have to read his mail i don't
[1:52:11] have to know every detail of their life
[1:52:13] all i have to do is lift them up to the
[1:52:16] lord lord you know who bobby is
[1:52:20] this is a privilege
[1:52:22] to live a supernatural life
[1:52:25] it's a privilege that every one of us
[1:52:27] can enjoy
[1:52:28] every one of us can live a supernatural
[1:52:31] life because we're filled with a
[1:52:33] supernatural god anybody with me
[1:52:36] and here is your part my part is to
[1:52:38] study and pray and get ready to get over
[1:52:41] here and deliver
[1:52:44] i never want to take for granted that
[1:52:46] what i prepared on saturday night
[1:52:49] is good enough for sunday morning
[1:52:52] and so i take an hour
[1:52:54] every sunday morning to get up and go to
[1:52:56] the dining room table and look back over
[1:52:59] what i have studied and prepared
[1:53:02] sometimes i go with it sometimes i have
[1:53:04] to pull something else out because i
[1:53:07] feel him leading
[1:53:08] then when i finish that i go get a
[1:53:10] shower i get dressed and i get over here
[1:53:13] as close to 10 o'clock as i possibly can
[1:53:16] and sometimes i take another 30 minutes
[1:53:19] to go back over to make sure
[1:53:22] that what that's my part i'm not asking
[1:53:24] for your you know for your uh aw
[1:53:27] or or for you to think that's wonderful
[1:53:30] or for you to brag on me i'm not telling
[1:53:32] you that for that reason at all i'm
[1:53:35] telling you that's my part
[1:53:37] i receive 50 of the tithe that's given
[1:53:40] in this church that's what i provide for
[1:53:42] myself and my family with
[1:53:44] the rest of it stays here to pay the
[1:53:46] bills and things that are needed i have
[1:53:48] to pay tithing taxes off of mine just
[1:53:50] like you do yours so you treat me well
[1:53:54] you you treat me well
[1:53:57] you you make sure that i am taken care
[1:54:00] of
[1:54:01] in the labor that i do but here's your
[1:54:03] part
[1:54:04] this is your responsibility
[1:54:07] this is what you're supposed to do when
[1:54:09] you come to the house of the lord and
[1:54:10] the ears of all the people were
[1:54:14] attentive
[1:54:16] unto the book of the law
[1:54:17] am i am i preaching something out of
[1:54:19] context or something here am i just
[1:54:21] telling you through isn't that what we
[1:54:22] should do as believers
[1:54:24] we should give this word of god the
[1:54:26] highest respect
[1:54:28] somebody said well there's a little bit
[1:54:30] of man mixed in it i've never heard a
[1:54:32] message yet that there wasn't
[1:54:34] i never heard brother branham preach
[1:54:36] thus saith the lord from the first word
[1:54:38] out of his mouth to the last either i'm
[1:54:40] not one of those who believe such
[1:54:42] i believe there was a little bit of man
[1:54:44] in there sometime too when he greeted
[1:54:46] somebody
[1:54:48] when he said something wrong a little
[1:54:50] bit i don't believe that was us saith
[1:54:51] the lord when he mispronounced something
[1:54:54] or when he got a little detail out of
[1:54:55] play god let us have all of that to
[1:54:58] remind us that he was a sinner saved by
[1:55:01] grace and surrender to god and i know
[1:55:04] you all read those texts from
[1:55:06] jeffersonville and i know that some of
[1:55:08] you believe
[1:55:09] that every word that came out of his
[1:55:11] mouth was thus saith the lord but i want
[1:55:13] to tell you that's blasphemy i don't
[1:55:14] believe that
[1:55:16] you're making a man more than he made
[1:55:17] himself that is over the top
[1:55:21] he was a human being but the most
[1:55:24] surrendered
[1:55:25] i don't know of any man through the ages
[1:55:28] more surrender to his calling than
[1:55:31] brother branham was
[1:55:33] but he was a human being
[1:55:35] he didn't have perfect recall
[1:55:38] you don't have to say man most of us
[1:55:40] have clear enough vision to be able to
[1:55:42] see it
[1:55:44] our responsibility
[1:55:46] is to come and prepare our hearts to
[1:55:49] hear what the lord would have to say to
[1:55:52] us
[1:55:53] and we take every bit of that right back
[1:55:56] to the absolute
[1:55:58] we do it when brother branham is
[1:55:59] preaching because he told us to do that
[1:56:02] you should do that when your pastor is
[1:56:04] preaching because that's just god's
[1:56:06] order
[1:56:08] so you take what you hear back to the
[1:56:11] absolute word of god if it lines up pray
[1:56:15] into it until god reveals it to you and
[1:56:18] makes it clear to you but we have a
[1:56:20] responsibility when we come
[1:56:23] amen
[1:56:25] and and that's to give god every
[1:56:27] opportunity that we possibly can to
[1:56:31] speak to our hearts and instruct us for
[1:56:33] what's coming
[1:56:35] and that means not hanging out in the
[1:56:37] nurseries or the bathrooms or the
[1:56:39] couches or the sofas or the vestibule
[1:56:42] when it's unnecessary if it's necessary
[1:56:45] god knows your heart if it's unnecessary
[1:56:48] you should be sitting in here under the
[1:56:50] inspiration of the holy spirit
[1:56:52] i wouldn't take that back if you paid me
[1:56:54] double this week
[1:56:56] it's just the truth
[1:56:58] and you ought to say amen
[1:57:01] all right and ezra the scribes stood up
[1:57:04] upon a pulpit of wood
[1:57:06] which they had made for the purpose and
[1:57:08] that purpose was to read the book of the
[1:57:10] law
[1:57:11] why because they had been in captivity
[1:57:14] and they didn't have access to these
[1:57:16] things and now they're getting used to
[1:57:19] being able to hear the word of the lord
[1:57:21] again and and so the scripture here in
[1:57:24] nehemiah names the names of some of
[1:57:27] those that were standing to the left of
[1:57:30] ezra the priest
[1:57:32] in verse four
[1:57:33] in verse five and ezra opened
[1:57:38] the book in the sight of all the people
[1:57:40] for he was above
[1:57:42] all the people he was standing on an
[1:57:44] elevated platform behind a wooden desk
[1:57:47] that had been created been made had been
[1:57:50] crafted for that book of the law to be
[1:57:52] on while it was being read you follow
[1:57:54] all that
[1:57:56] so i sometimes people say i don't know
[1:57:58] why the preacher has to stand above i
[1:58:00] don't know why there has to be a big
[1:58:01] chair for him to sit in i don't know why
[1:58:03] there has to be a pulpit to stand behind
[1:58:05] these are just very practical things to
[1:58:08] help us receive the word of the lord
[1:58:11] amen
[1:58:14] one preacher came here one time many
[1:58:16] many years ago and he said there was
[1:58:18] brother shelley sitting up there in a
[1:58:20] red chair like the pope
[1:58:24] well the chair was dusty rose
[1:58:27] and i didn't think i was the pope
[1:58:29] not then or now
[1:58:33] now and ezra opened the book verse 5 in
[1:58:36] the sight of all the people
[1:58:38] for he was above all the people and when
[1:58:41] he opened it all the people stood up
[1:58:44] this is a way to show respect to god's
[1:58:47] word
[1:58:49] if the queen of england were to walk in
[1:58:51] here today
[1:58:52] if joe biden should shuffle in here
[1:58:54] today our president
[1:58:57] we would all stand up you would
[1:59:00] you would
[1:59:03] you would stand up
[1:59:05] because if you can't respect a man
[1:59:07] brother branham said you can at least
[1:59:09] respect the position that he holds
[1:59:17] then there's nothing more precious
[1:59:19] and the word of god is it's red
[1:59:23] don't get religious
[1:59:25] i know there's times you read another
[1:59:27] verse in this in the service and you
[1:59:29] don't stand up every time but it's just
[1:59:31] that and if you're not able god
[1:59:32] certainly understands that physically
[1:59:34] need to rest god understands that but
[1:59:36] what a privilege
[1:59:38] i love it because if we have a guest
[1:59:40] preacher here that comes and doesn't
[1:59:43] particularly practice that or or doesn't
[1:59:46] feel like he has liberty to ask you to
[1:59:48] stand i just love it when i when brother
[1:59:50] robert will stand
[1:59:52] i just love it when somebody else will
[1:59:54] pave the way and make it less awkward
[1:59:56] for the rest of us to get up and stand
[1:59:57] not to be religious
[2:00:02] just to give a little honor and a
[2:00:03] respect to the reading of the word my
[2:00:06] you want to hear it sometime when the
[2:00:08] prophet preached on respects
[2:00:10] we ought to listen to that from time to
[2:00:12] time amen let's go on
[2:00:15] and ezra bless the lord the great god
[2:00:18] and all the people answered oh oh my
[2:00:22] oh my
[2:00:28] this is so prophetic
[2:00:35] i wish i could show how some of you do
[2:00:41] the other day when i was speaking about
[2:00:43] something personal
[2:00:44] i look around there's people that turn
[2:00:46] to the wall
[2:00:51] facing the wall because they don't want
[2:00:52] to face look folks
[2:00:55] you've got a responsibility
[2:00:58] somebody's looking at you
[2:01:01] i've swallowed a lot of things
[2:01:03] knowing that somebody was watching me
[2:01:06] you can too
[2:01:09] i know there are people sometimes get
[2:01:11] mad in church and stomp out
[2:01:14] i wouldn't do that if i were you
[2:01:17] i'd sit to the bitter end
[2:01:20] i'd go out and complain then if i needed
[2:01:22] to
[2:01:23] but i wouldn't jump out like that for
[2:01:25] nothing in this world because i want you
[2:01:27] to know you don't ever know when you may
[2:01:30] meet an angel in the aisle
[2:01:33] i've seen them
[2:01:35] i've seen that kind i know what kind
[2:01:37] that is that's the kind that stood in
[2:01:38] balaam's way i know they're here
[2:01:40] sometime you don't want to encounter oh
[2:01:43] you're just trying to make people afraid
[2:01:44] no just trying to teach us a little
[2:01:45] respect sometimes we need to be reminded
[2:01:47] of that sometimes and all the people
[2:01:50] answered what
[2:01:52] amen amen
[2:01:54] amen amen
[2:01:56] amen amen
[2:01:58] and you know how they did it with
[2:02:00] lifting up their hands oh amen amen amen
[2:02:04] amen
[2:02:05] and they bowed their heads and worshiped
[2:02:08] the lord with their faces to the ground
[2:02:10] that's biblical
[2:02:13] you may not be jumping
[2:02:16] you may not be running
[2:02:18] there may be a time that you just stand
[2:02:20] there with your face bowed down in your
[2:02:23] heart
[2:02:24] reverencing the goodness of god
[2:02:27] come on now
[2:02:29] that's biblical
[2:02:31] i don't you just want me to act like you
[2:02:33] do no i wouldn't want you to do that
[2:02:36] that wouldn't be necessary
[2:02:38] but just do something
[2:02:40] show god's word respect and honor and
[2:02:43] show his presence
[2:02:45] amen amen
[2:02:47] somebody ought to amen amen
[2:02:50] and then verse 7 gives us a bunch of
[2:02:52] these names
[2:02:53] and the levites caused the people to
[2:02:56] understand the law and the people stood
[2:02:58] in their place i don't know if you know
[2:03:00] anything much about the the return of
[2:03:03] the exiles but this was after the third
[2:03:06] return
[2:03:07] there had to be three different alias
[2:03:11] three different returns because they got
[2:03:13] ready to do what needed to be done and
[2:03:16] no levites had come
[2:03:19] the priest had gotten comfortable
[2:03:22] in babylon
[2:03:24] so there had to be another exodus to
[2:03:27] bring the preachers out
[2:03:30] to bring the priest out so they could
[2:03:32] serve the lord
[2:03:37] and they caused this and this is their
[2:03:38] jobs
[2:03:41] josephine and hanan
[2:03:44] and pelia and the levites caused the
[2:03:46] people to understand the law that means
[2:03:49] they explained
[2:03:52] it means they broke it down
[2:03:56] and showed how we apply the law in our
[2:03:59] life that's what preaching does
[2:04:02] and the people stood
[2:04:05] in their play they've been standing up
[2:04:08] this whole time
[2:04:11] i said to rj when he come back there to
[2:04:13] help me with my mind i said rj i wonder
[2:04:14] if we could talk the people into
[2:04:16] standing up the whole service
[2:04:19] he looked at me laughed a little bit and
[2:04:21] he said i don't know
[2:04:23] i don't know you could try something
[2:04:25] like that and i said you know why i say
[2:04:27] that
[2:04:29] because when you all are standing up
[2:04:31] worshiping the lord this place looks
[2:04:33] full
[2:04:35] but when you sit down it don't look near
[2:04:37] as full
[2:04:39] these folks weren't standing up so the
[2:04:41] house would look full they were standing
[2:04:44] up because they were so glad to be back
[2:04:46] under the reading of the word
[2:04:51] that they just stood up the whole time
[2:04:54] so they read in the book of the law of
[2:04:56] god distinctly and gave the sense
[2:04:59] and caused them to understand the
[2:05:01] reading
[2:05:03] verse 9 and nehemiah which is in which
[2:05:06] is the tershata and ezra the priests the
[2:05:10] scribe and the levites that taught the
[2:05:13] people
[2:05:14] said unto all the people this day is
[2:05:18] holy
[2:05:19] unto
[2:05:21] the lord your god
[2:05:23] listen now here's where i want to get
[2:05:25] more not
[2:05:29] i thought this was a solemn day
[2:05:32] and now he said a holy day a set apart
[2:05:35] day a sacred day
[2:05:37] and then he tells them more not
[2:05:40] nor
[2:05:41] weep
[2:05:44] for all the people wept
[2:05:46] when they heard the words of the law
[2:05:51] now verse 10 i want you to know the
[2:05:52] context i wanted you to know the context
[2:05:56] of the joy of the lord is your strength
[2:05:59] i wanted you to know the context we use
[2:06:01] it all out of context it's okay
[2:06:04] it's true don't matter how you use it
[2:06:06] the joy of the lord is your strength the
[2:06:08] joy of the lord is your strength the joy
[2:06:09] of the lord is your strength
[2:06:11] when you're weak the joy of the lord is
[2:06:13] your strength when you're having trouble
[2:06:15] the joy of the lord is your strength but
[2:06:17] i wanted you to see the context
[2:06:20] 70 years of exile
[2:06:23] stay with me
[2:06:27] no word
[2:06:29] no fellowship
[2:06:31] some hardship
[2:06:34] some suffering
[2:06:36] now they're back
[2:06:38] the word is being read openly to them
[2:06:40] again
[2:06:41] but they're weeping
[2:06:43] they're still caught up in the grief
[2:06:47] of the last 70 years
[2:06:50] then he said unto them look then he said
[2:06:51] unto them go your way
[2:06:53] weep not
[2:06:55] more not
[2:06:57] go your way
[2:06:58] eat the fat
[2:07:01] drink the sweet
[2:07:02] whoop
[2:07:06] this must have been a southern gathering
[2:07:10] there was no unsweet tea no unsweet tea
[2:07:12] at this gathering
[2:07:17] go your way eat the fat
[2:07:20] had to be beef
[2:07:22] ain't nobody gonna eat chicken fat
[2:07:24] drink the sweet
[2:07:27] and send portions unto them for whom
[2:07:30] nothing is prepared for this day is holy
[2:07:33] unto our lord
[2:07:36] neither be ye sorry
[2:07:40] neither be ye sorry
[2:07:43] this is not time to be sorry
[2:07:47] this is not time to mourn
[2:07:50] this is not a time to weep he said
[2:07:54] this is not a time to live in regret
[2:08:00] caught in the past
[2:08:02] for the joy
[2:08:05] here's the context for the joy of the
[2:08:08] lord
[2:08:11] you're not a prisoner anymore
[2:08:13] you're not in babylonian exile anymore
[2:08:17] you are not cut off from the homeland
[2:08:20] anymore
[2:08:22] you have returned to the homeland
[2:08:26] [Applause]
[2:08:29] yes
[2:08:31] you have come back to the homeland
[2:08:34] you have returned to the word
[2:08:38] that's what he's saying
[2:08:39] not a time to weep not a time to mourn
[2:08:42] not a time to regret
[2:08:44] not a time to be sorry
[2:08:47] you've already repented
[2:08:49] repented every mile you walked
[2:08:53] from babylon to jerusalem
[2:08:57] the closer you got the more you repented
[2:09:00] because you saw the burned ruins and the
[2:09:02] destruction of the city that you were
[2:09:05] not there to protect because you had
[2:09:07] disobeyed me god's talking because you
[2:09:11] had disobeyed me and i sent you as
[2:09:13] exiles into a strange and confused land
[2:09:16] the land of babylon and now you're
[2:09:18] coming back and you got to thinking
[2:09:20] about all that and you got under a
[2:09:22] spirit of grief and you've come back to
[2:09:24] jerusalem and you're still moaning and
[2:09:26] you're still mourning and you're still
[2:09:29] grieving because you still live like
[2:09:31] those in exile but he said i want you to
[2:09:34] know it's time to eat the fat
[2:09:38] drink the sweet
[2:09:40] send portions to those who have nothing
[2:09:43] for this day is holy unto the lord
[2:09:46] neither be sorry for the joy of the lord
[2:09:48] for the joy of the lord for the joy of
[2:09:49] the lord for the joy of the lord for the
[2:09:51] joy of the lord for the joy of the lord
[2:09:54] for the joy of the lord for the joy of
[2:09:56] the lord is your strength
[2:10:05] nehemiah 8 1 we don't have to go back
[2:10:07] there but we just read it it mentions
[2:10:09] that this event occurred on the first
[2:10:11] day of the seventh month
[2:10:14] does that sound familiar to anybody
[2:10:17] that initiated the feast of tabernacles
[2:10:20] in fact the first day of the seventh
[2:10:22] month was the feast of trumpets
[2:10:24] and the feast of trumpets is the
[2:10:25] beginning of the celebration of the fall
[2:10:28] feast of israel
[2:10:29] and what we call the feast of
[2:10:31] tabernacles
[2:10:33] leviticus 23 24 the sisters have it
[2:10:35] there it says speak unto the children of
[2:10:38] israel saying
[2:10:39] in the seventh month and the first day
[2:10:40] of the month shall you have a sabbath a
[2:10:43] memorial of blowing of trumpets
[2:10:46] unholy convocation
[2:10:49] so they have spent 70 years out of the
[2:10:51] homeland excuse me
[2:10:53] 70 years out of the homeland in babylon
[2:10:57] in exile in captivity and bondage
[2:11:00] and now they're home
[2:11:02] and for the first time they can
[2:11:04] celebrate the feast of tabernacles which
[2:11:07] is a feast of joy
[2:11:09] it's not a feast of fasting
[2:11:11] it's not a feast of mourning
[2:11:14] it's not a feast of repentance
[2:11:17] it's a feast of joy
[2:11:19] it's one of the names it's one of the
[2:11:20] names
[2:11:22] the feast of simca the feast of joy
[2:11:25] and now he said so you're going to have
[2:11:27] to get out of the past
[2:11:31] you're going to have to get over your
[2:11:32] stuff
[2:11:33] and you're going to have to do what what
[2:11:35] you've been commanded to do
[2:11:37] blow the trumpets and celebrate the
[2:11:39] goodness of god this is a holy moad this
[2:11:42] is an appointment of the lord with his
[2:11:44] people that's why we're here this
[2:11:45] morning
[2:11:47] you may not see it as the same but i see
[2:11:50] it as the same we have come today to
[2:11:53] meet with the lord
[2:11:56] it's holy unto the lord it's sacred unto
[2:11:59] him and no matter what you're going
[2:12:01] through the answer is going to be always
[2:12:02] the same the joy of the lord is your
[2:12:04] strength the joy of the lord is your
[2:12:06] strength the joy of the lord is your
[2:12:07] strength come on now
[2:12:09] come on now remember joy's not joy
[2:12:10] unless it has expression
[2:12:13] that's not dragging
[2:12:16] that's pushing
[2:12:18] because sometimes all you can do is drag
[2:12:19] a leg
[2:12:21] but you do it in the right spirit you do
[2:12:23] it pushing with everything you got i'd
[2:12:25] rather drag to the house of god than not
[2:12:27] get there at all
[2:12:28] anybody say amen
[2:12:31] all right now let me go through this
[2:12:32] with you quickly and and we'll hurry
[2:12:34] along and uh as best we can
[2:12:37] i don't want to wear you out i don't
[2:12:39] want you to miss it
[2:12:40] but i i don't want you to be so weary
[2:12:42] you can't hear
[2:12:43] and some of you started off that way i
[2:12:45] can't imagine where you are now
[2:12:48] the feast of tabernacles was a feast
[2:12:50] comprised of three special appointments
[2:12:52] trumpets atonement and tabernacles just
[2:12:56] as the overall feast of passover is
[2:12:58] comprised of three holy events passover
[2:13:02] unleavened bread and first fruits
[2:13:04] these two sets of feasts were comprised
[2:13:07] of three special events
[2:13:10] three in the spring
[2:13:12] three in the fall
[2:13:13] and in between
[2:13:15] was shavuot
[2:13:17] 50 days after the feast of first fruits
[2:13:20] with shavuot which we call pentecost
[2:13:23] the feast of passover was fulfilled by
[2:13:26] the death the crucifixion and the death
[2:13:28] of the lord jesus christ on the cross
[2:13:31] the feast of unleavened bread was
[2:13:33] fulfilled by the burial of the lord
[2:13:35] jesus the feast of first fruits was
[2:13:37] fulfilled by the waving the as they were
[2:13:40] waving the first sheaves of harvest our
[2:13:44] lord jesus was a first fruit offering he
[2:13:47] was waved in resurrection over the heads
[2:13:50] of the people fulfilling the feast of
[2:13:52] first fruits
[2:13:54] that those first three feasts make up
[2:13:57] what we call
[2:13:59] pesach or passover
[2:14:01] but it's unleavened bread passover and
[2:14:04] feast of first fruits then
[2:14:06] 50 days later it's the pentecost it's
[2:14:08] the shavuot
[2:14:10] in the old testament it was giving of
[2:14:11] the law on mount sinai in the new
[2:14:14] testament it was the filling the
[2:14:17] infilling of the holy ghost on the day
[2:14:20] of pentecost where 120
[2:14:22] received a baptism of fire
[2:14:25] it's powerful
[2:14:26] god meticulously you're still awake
[2:14:29] god meticulously fulfilled his word just
[2:14:33] as he promised
[2:14:36] you believe that
[2:14:37] now when the israelites were returning
[2:14:40] to jerusalem from exile
[2:14:42] after nehemiah had already gone back the
[2:14:44] cupbearer it took nehemiah to get back
[2:14:47] to get the levites there nehemiah and
[2:14:50] ezra gathered the people
[2:14:52] after this third exodus
[2:14:55] leaving exile leaving babylon and
[2:14:58] getting them back and now the law was
[2:15:00] being read
[2:15:01] the israelites were overwhelmed with
[2:15:03] sorrow and condemnation
[2:15:06] since their lives failed to meet god's
[2:15:08] law
[2:15:09] they saw their mistake
[2:15:12] they saw what they had done
[2:15:16] and they began weeping
[2:15:18] and tabernacles is supposed to be a
[2:15:20] feast of joy
[2:15:25] but in nehemiah 8
[2:15:27] the people were grieved
[2:15:30] and depressed
[2:15:32] what were they grieved about
[2:15:35] they were grieving over the seemingly
[2:15:37] wasted years in exile
[2:15:39] away from the place where they know they
[2:15:41] should have been
[2:15:42] they had become enlightened by the
[2:15:44] teaching from the word of god what was
[2:15:47] being taught to them on this day the
[2:15:49] feast of trumpets it was not only being
[2:15:52] read but it was being expounded it was
[2:15:54] being taught it was being broke down
[2:15:57] they fell under conviction
[2:16:00] they saw how wrong their lives had been
[2:16:04] but ezra had no condemnation for them
[2:16:07] and neither did the god of israel
[2:16:10] he had gathered them back
[2:16:12] just like paul's sufferings and house
[2:16:15] arrest provided letters of truth that
[2:16:19] you and i can read today the exile of
[2:16:22] god's people caused them to come home
[2:16:24] with a fresh new appreciation for the
[2:16:27] goodness of god in his word it caused
[2:16:30] them there's nothing like the lack of
[2:16:32] the word the lack of getting to church
[2:16:35] the lack of being in the presence of the
[2:16:37] lord to make you appreciate it when you
[2:16:39] are able to come home
[2:16:41] and this is what we read about here but
[2:16:44] ezra came with no condemnation
[2:16:46] in fact he said quit grieving
[2:16:49] are you watching me or the phone
[2:16:53] quit grieving
[2:16:56] rejoice
[2:16:59] eat and drink
[2:17:00] and be merry and have joy
[2:17:03] for the joy of the lord is your strength
[2:17:05] and you're going to need his strength
[2:17:06] because we're still rebuilding this
[2:17:08] place
[2:17:09] come on now
[2:17:11] this is still an hour of restoration
[2:17:14] and you're going to need the joy of the
[2:17:16] lord
[2:17:18] basically ezra was saying you've come
[2:17:20] out of babylon now get on with your life
[2:17:25] anybody offended
[2:17:27] and that's pretty much what he was
[2:17:28] saying he said go your way
[2:17:30] get up
[2:17:32] and get out
[2:17:34] you came out of babylon now get on with
[2:17:36] your new life don't fret don't grump
[2:17:38] don't worry
[2:17:40] eat
[2:17:41] drink
[2:17:43] be merry
[2:17:46] in other words god had a purpose and a
[2:17:47] plan in your exile he was dealing with
[2:17:50] your heart issues
[2:17:52] he was dealing with your disobedience
[2:17:53] it's dealt with now
[2:17:55] in your home
[2:17:56] now quit living like you're exiled
[2:17:58] quit living like you're slaves to a
[2:18:00] foreign confused land you have come home
[2:18:04] this revealed word is the homeland
[2:18:07] you're no longer living under the
[2:18:09] confusion of babylon you're no longer
[2:18:11] living under the confusion of
[2:18:13] denominationalism
[2:18:16] you're no longer living under the
[2:18:18] umbrella of the mother
[2:18:20] you see the word
[2:18:22] your eyes have been anointed with eyes
[2:18:24] have you know who god is
[2:18:28] you know what original sin is
[2:18:31] you know what was under the seals
[2:18:33] you see god revealing himself just like
[2:18:37] he said he would
[2:18:39] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[2:18:41] the bride is the mystery of christ
[2:18:43] revealed
[2:18:44] we see adoption coming on
[2:18:47] we see maturity coming on
[2:18:50] closer than we've ever been before so
[2:18:52] stop your grieving
[2:18:56] rejoice
[2:18:59] rejoice
[2:19:01] do your joy again
[2:19:03] that's what it means do it again choose
[2:19:05] joy rejoice
[2:19:07] and again i say rejoice everything had a
[2:19:10] purpose and everything had a season you
[2:19:13] were once in a season to mourn you are
[2:19:15] now in a season to rejoice just giving
[2:19:17] you the word just tell me what's
[2:19:18] happening here if you want to apply that
[2:19:20] to the day and hour you live in you'd be
[2:19:22] a wise man you'd be a wise woman to
[2:19:26] update this scripture to your life today
[2:19:29] come on now i don't care how bad it is
[2:19:31] you're not in babylonian confusion
[2:19:35] i don't care how bad it is you're not a
[2:19:36] slave to sin anymore
[2:19:39] the enemy is not running you all over
[2:19:41] town anymore
[2:19:47] ecclesiastes 3 11. i'm going to hurry
[2:19:50] along now

[2:19:54] there's 26 pages
[2:19:58] i asked uh
[2:20:00] luke or levi who brought it to me
[2:20:03] luke
[2:20:04] luke brought it to me i said you think i
[2:20:05] can be through with 26 pages by five he
[2:20:07] said no i think it'd be about seven
[2:20:11] you don't have much confidence in me to
[2:20:13] get through at five
[2:20:15] he hath made everything beautiful
[2:20:20] i just want to preach
[2:20:24] hallelujah
[2:20:26] yeah house arrest 10
[2:20:28] years he had made everything beautiful
[2:20:32] in his time
[2:20:34] 70 years of babylonian exile he has made
[2:20:38] everything beautiful
[2:20:40] in his time
[2:20:42] i wish not to come to the lord sooner in
[2:20:44] life people tell me that all the time i
[2:20:47] wish you had of too
[2:20:51] i wish we all could have
[2:20:53] i came to him about as early as i could
[2:20:55] he met me the first time at 18 months
[2:20:58] visited me the next time at three and
[2:21:00] called me to preach at seven so i was
[2:21:01] pretty pretty early getting started
[2:21:03] started pretty early
[2:21:05] but i understand what people mean when
[2:21:08] they say i wish i hadn't wasted a day
[2:21:12] let me tell you something everything has
[2:21:13] a reason
[2:21:15] everything has a purpose
[2:21:17] you'll appreciate i want you to know
[2:21:19] you'll appreciate i saw some of you i
[2:21:21] saw some of you
[2:21:22] i saw a sister i'm not gonna call her
[2:21:24] name don't remember i saw some i saw
[2:21:26] some staggering around up here today
[2:21:29] i knew you'd pressed in to come up here
[2:21:31] and worship the lord i saw a few of you
[2:21:33] staggering around praising god i knew
[2:21:35] you'd got under something good i knew
[2:21:38] you were thankful that he had called you
[2:21:40] out of a life of sin i'm thinking about
[2:21:42] last sunday when we begin to testify and
[2:21:45] say i am going to call her name sister
[2:21:46] beth and sister beth got up and give her
[2:21:48] testimony i told the girl who cuts my
[2:21:51] hair this week
[2:21:53] i didn't tell her name
[2:21:55] but i said we had a testimony service
[2:21:57] sunday after service and a sister got up
[2:22:00] and said this is what i was
[2:22:05] [Music]
[2:22:07] but i ain't that
[2:22:09] i ain't that anymore
[2:22:13] to god be the glory
[2:22:22] she said well stephen you can't get any
[2:22:24] more plainer than that i said no plainer
[2:22:25] than that that's how i like it
[2:22:28] no need and dressing it up
[2:22:32] no need in making it sound glamorous
[2:22:35] there's no glamour in a life of sin
[2:22:39] whoa glory be to god
[2:22:41] let me tell you something i don't have
[2:22:43] to tell people like that to praise the
[2:22:45] lord
[2:22:48] i don't have to tell people like that to
[2:22:50] say amen amen
[2:22:55] because
[2:22:56] when much has been forgiven
[2:23:00] he who exists has experienced that
[2:23:03] overwhelming forgiveness of god they
[2:23:06] love the most they love much
[2:23:10] nobody has to beg them come on
[2:23:14] nobody has to beg them
[2:23:16] to praise the lord there there are there
[2:23:18] are some of them there some of them are
[2:23:20] right there there are some of them right
[2:23:21] there that's not all of them but that's
[2:23:22] some of them
[2:23:24] nobody has to beg them
[2:23:26] because they can say what i was and what
[2:23:29] i'm not
[2:23:30] what i am
[2:23:32] by the grace of god it all had a purpose
[2:23:35] it all had a season you had to walk
[2:23:38] through some of that
[2:23:41] or you'd have been as fickle as a
[2:23:43] backslider in the in the baptist church
[2:23:45] you know
[2:23:46] where they don't even believe in
[2:23:47] backsliding
[2:23:49] you you had to have a real
[2:23:52] real deep place
[2:23:54] a deep deep pit
[2:23:56] to reach up out of
[2:23:59] you'll never fall in that same kind of
[2:24:01] pit again
[2:24:03] the flame may flicker whoa
[2:24:06] but it'll never die
[2:24:09] it'll never go out because something
[2:24:10] will pull your heart and you'll find
[2:24:12] your way right back to what you know god
[2:24:14] has done in your life no church could
[2:24:17] have done it for you no preacher could
[2:24:19] have done it for you come on now no
[2:24:21] denomination could have done it for you
[2:24:24] this homeland
[2:24:27] this is the homeland
[2:24:29] that is what's got you out
[2:24:32] you may not have even known him but the
[2:24:33] word was seeking for you the word was
[2:24:36] searching for you the word was looking
[2:24:38] for you and he found you yes he did
[2:24:42] rejoice rejoice somebody
[2:24:45] [Applause]
[2:24:47] somebody ought to rejoice
[2:24:51] hallelujah
[2:24:52] [Applause]
[2:24:54] hallelujah
[2:24:57] don't nobody know like i know what he's
[2:25:00] done for me
[2:25:01] come on
[2:25:03] you do it for him
[2:25:04] [Music]
[2:25:09] like they used to see can't nobody do me
[2:25:12] like jesus
[2:25:15] hallelujah
[2:25:21] i don't know all of your testimonies
[2:25:26] don't matter
[2:25:28] you see that
[2:25:29] i don't know them all
[2:25:31] but i just heard an amen coming back
[2:25:33] there from paw paw i remember his not
[2:25:36] all of it just what he shared
[2:25:38] i remember what he told me was sitting
[2:25:40] on the coffee table
[2:25:42] in front of him
[2:25:44] when he realized this is not who i am
[2:25:47] my god that mercy
[2:25:50] you see people of aca
[2:25:57] bless his name
[2:26:00] you see people dressed up on a sunday
[2:26:02] morning
[2:26:03] that you worship with your whole life
[2:26:06] and you think it's always been like that
[2:26:08] with them but i want you to know there
[2:26:11] are people here this morning that were
[2:26:13] in the very far throes of sin and jesus
[2:26:17] not a church

[2:26:24] confused about who they were confused
[2:26:28] about what they loved confused
[2:26:32] that's babylon
[2:26:34] whoa
[2:26:38] that's babylon

[2:26:43] your nerves somebody's flag bothers you

[2:27:02] [Applause]
[2:27:05] some of us aren't so mad with the
[2:27:06] preacher that we can't get what we need
[2:27:08] from god
[2:27:10] some of us have made up our mind we're
[2:27:12] not going to waste these hours we spend
[2:27:15] over here on a sunday morning we're
[2:27:17] going to give god everything i'm going

[2:27:27] rejoice
[2:27:36] i'm all right
[2:27:40] everything he's made everything
[2:27:41] beautiful
[2:27:43] in his time i don't have my watch on i
[2:27:45] took it off
[2:27:46] also he has set the world in their heart
[2:27:48] so that no man can find out the work
[2:27:50] that god maketh from the beginning to
[2:27:53] the end it's 123.
[2:27:55] you don't have to look i just looked for
[2:27:56] you ecclesiastes 2 24 look at this
[2:28:00] there is nothing better for a man listen
[2:28:03] listen listen
[2:28:07] there is nothing better for a man than
[2:28:09] he should eat and drink
[2:28:12] and that he should make his soul enjoy
[2:28:14] good
[2:28:15] in his labor
[2:28:16] this also i saw that it was from the
[2:28:19] hand of god
[2:28:21] it is not an unbiblical principle for
[2:28:24] someone to enjoy the gifts of god in
[2:28:27] their life when when when others i know
[2:28:30] i know i know i know i know that summer
[2:28:32] morning and i know that some are
[2:28:34] groaning and i know there's some i know
[2:28:36] poor little widow women who who god
[2:28:39] bounces them back and brings them
[2:28:41] through and they're afraid to testify of
[2:28:43] what god's done because they're afraid
[2:28:45] they're going to offend somebody else
[2:28:46] who will think they hadn't grieved
[2:28:48] enough
[2:28:50] we're not living in the 1800s you don't
[2:28:53] have to wear black a whole year
[2:28:55] i'm not telling you that grief isn't
[2:28:57] real and that it won't revisit and that
[2:28:59] it won't eat at your life it will but
[2:29:02] don't you be ashamed if you get up one
[2:29:04] day and decide to live
[2:29:08] don't you be embarrassed if one day you
[2:29:10] say i've repented now now i'm going to
[2:29:13] get up and be who i am
[2:29:14] [Applause]
[2:29:16] how long would you have someone to be
[2:29:17] ashamed
[2:29:20] for what they've done in sin
[2:29:22] how long would you want them to pay a
[2:29:24] prize
[2:29:25] maybe you heard a testimony here by a
[2:29:27] young sister last sunday maybe you heard
[2:29:29] maybe you say well the last thing we
[2:29:30] know is that she was asking not to come
[2:29:33] the next thing we know is she's
[2:29:34] attending a service she did because she
[2:29:36] was invited to do so
[2:29:39] and because she had satisfied the
[2:29:40] requirement that was asked of her
[2:29:43] come on
[2:29:44] now how long does she have to go before
[2:29:46] she can rejoice
[2:29:51] thank you
[2:29:52] how long does she have to go before she
[2:29:54] can shout
[2:29:58] you got a probate you go put a probation
[2:30:00] period beyond the repentance season no
[2:30:02] no you might
[2:30:03] you might but i'm not
[2:30:06] eat
[2:30:06] and drink and rejoice and again i say
[2:30:11] rejoice don't fret don't grump don't
[2:30:15] worry you can't change the past
[2:30:18] [Applause]
[2:30:19] [Music]
[2:30:34] in the shortest summary
[2:30:36] the story of ezra nehemiah
[2:30:39] is the story of god's people coming home
[2:30:41] after 70-year exile and rebuilding
[2:30:43] jerusalem you remember i preached a
[2:30:45] series
[2:30:46] on restoring the gates of jerusalem when
[2:30:48] we first moved into this building i went
[2:30:50] through all the gates when they were
[2:30:52] restored and what they represented
[2:30:55] because they returned home the city was
[2:30:57] rebuilt the temple was restored and the
[2:31:00] stage was set for the eventual arrival
[2:31:03] of the messiah the history behind the
[2:31:07] 70-year exile is very important here and
[2:31:10] i'd like for you to listen to the notes
[2:31:11] i prepared just for a moment won't take
[2:31:13] long when all of judah was taken into
[2:31:15] exile when they were all forced to walk
[2:31:18] to ancient persia
[2:31:21] there were no buses
[2:31:23] there were no trains
[2:31:25] there were no camel trains to take them
[2:31:27] on they walked from jerusalem to persia
[2:31:32] to what we now know today as southern
[2:31:34] iraq
[2:31:35] and northern iran
[2:31:37] just like this scroll
[2:31:39] that's that's sitting here
[2:31:41] was hand carried
[2:31:43] out of iran or iraq
[2:31:45] hand carried
[2:31:47] when they came home when a family came
[2:31:49] home
[2:31:50] made aliyah
[2:31:51] in return really in fear they ran for
[2:31:54] fear in their life they hand carried
[2:31:56] that scroll they made the same walking
[2:31:58] journey
[2:31:59] that the children of israel made leaving
[2:32:01] jerusalem to persia and these people
[2:32:05] made their way home
[2:32:07] carrying that scroll and the possessions
[2:32:09] of a community
[2:32:11] that they had left behind
[2:32:14] when all of judah was taken into exile
[2:32:15] they're all forced to walk to ancient
[2:32:17] persia to where we would now know
[2:32:19] to what we would now know as southern
[2:32:21] iraq or northern iran the bible tells us
[2:32:23] that somewhere between four thousand six
[2:32:26] hundred and ten thousand people were
[2:32:28] taken into exile somewhere between forty
[2:32:31] six hundred and ten thousand people
[2:32:33] several thousand people were also left
[2:32:34] behind and the shocking reality is that
[2:32:37] the entire jewish population was so
[2:32:40] small maybe fifteen thousand people
[2:32:43] lived in jerusalem and about a hundred
[2:32:45] and twenty thousand lived in all judea
[2:32:48] but war and a terrible plague had nearly
[2:32:51] decimated the entire jewish population
[2:32:55] by the time of the exile in exile under
[2:32:58] better living conditions the group
[2:33:00] expanded from somewhere between 4 600
[2:33:03] and 10 000 they expanded to an estimated
[2:33:06] 150 000 people in 70 years
[2:33:10] i'd say that's pretty supernatural
[2:33:12] multiplication
[2:33:13] even today a small jewish population
[2:33:16] continues to live in both iraq and iran
[2:33:20] though their existence
[2:33:22] is simple
[2:33:24] and persecuted
[2:33:26] but did you see this
[2:33:28] there were between 100 000 and 150 000
[2:33:33] who were offered a chance to return to
[2:33:35] jerusalem to return home
[2:33:38] after 70 years of being out of the
[2:33:40] homeland and only a fraction i want you
[2:33:42] to hear this
[2:33:45] only a fraction of that 150 000 took
[2:33:49] advantage
[2:33:50] of the offer
[2:33:54] the king said go back
[2:33:56] here's the money
[2:33:58] here are the items for your temple
[2:34:00] you've got my blessing
[2:34:02] and my protection go home
[2:34:07] those who returned were a part of a
[2:34:09] great work of god those who stayed
[2:34:11] behind miss being a part of their story
[2:34:15] they had a life sure they had food sure
[2:34:17] they had families they had some
[2:34:19] community distinctives
[2:34:21] but
[2:34:22] they
[2:34:23] were not
[2:34:24] home
[2:34:26] when god's people first arrived in exile
[2:34:29] they had a very hard time conducting
[2:34:32] themselves as usual
[2:34:34] as they lived there for the 70 years
[2:34:37] they got more and more and more adjusted
[2:34:42] this is what the church is living
[2:34:44] through in this hour
[2:34:45] more and more adjusted to the world
[2:34:50] skirts getting shorter dresses getting
[2:34:53] tighter
[2:34:57] hair changing colors
[2:35:00] ear bobs and bobbles of all kinds
[2:35:03] hanging on us now that didn't used to
[2:35:05] hang on us
[2:35:07] come on now
[2:35:08] the more the longer you live in exile
[2:35:11] the longer you live under the influence
[2:35:14] of this world
[2:35:17] the more you'll long
[2:35:19] to stay in that
[2:35:21] even when the king says come home i'm
[2:35:23] making a way for you to come home it's
[2:35:25] harder it's harder it's harder anybody
[2:35:27] with me
[2:35:28] it doesn't really matter i'm going to
[2:35:30] say it anyway because it needs to be
[2:35:31] said
[2:35:34] i want to read this to you and i'm going
[2:35:36] to take just a few more moments it is 1
[2:35:38] 31.
[2:35:39] i need a few more minutes and then we'll
[2:35:42] uh
[2:35:44] always regret that i take so much time
[2:35:46] getting to where i want to get
[2:35:48] psalm 137 and 1
[2:35:51] by the rivers of babylon
[2:35:54] there we sat down
[2:35:57] yay we wept
[2:35:59] when we remembered zion they just got
[2:36:01] there they just got to babylon
[2:36:04] they're remembering zion
[2:36:08] they're weeping
[2:36:10] we hanged our harps
[2:36:13] verse two
[2:36:15] we hanged our harps on the willows
[2:36:18] in the midst thereof
[2:36:21] for there they that carried us away
[2:36:23] captive required of us a song
[2:36:27] and they that wasted us required of us
[2:36:29] mirth
[2:36:30] saying sing us
[2:36:33] one of the songs
[2:36:35] of zion they felt mocked
[2:36:38] and persecuted
[2:36:40] this was not part of the persecution
[2:36:43] this was really a desire of the of the
[2:36:46] persian people
[2:36:48] to hear those robust worshipers
[2:36:52] that they had heard so much about
[2:36:54] they had heard nobody worships like the
[2:36:56] israelites nobody dances like the
[2:36:58] israelites nobody sings like the
[2:37:01] israelites it's like they used to say
[2:37:02] about pentecostals nobody worships like
[2:37:05] those people worship we're just going
[2:37:07] around we don't have any business
[2:37:08] getting involved in that we're just
[2:37:10] going to go watch them
[2:37:12] and these babylonians they they weren't
[2:37:14] just trying to chide them and persecute
[2:37:16] them they really longed to see
[2:37:19] some of that joyous dancing
[2:37:22] some of that glorious singing
[2:37:25] seeing us
[2:37:26] one of the songs of zion
[2:37:29] and they said it to them in return in
[2:37:31] verse 4 how shall we sing the lord's
[2:37:35] song in a strange land
[2:37:39] if i forget the old jerusalem let my
[2:37:41] right hand forget her cunning
[2:37:43] if i do not remember thee let my tongue
[2:37:46] cleave to the roof of my mouth if i
[2:37:48] prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy
[2:37:52] in the beginning
[2:37:54] all ten thousand of them longed to be
[2:37:57] home
[2:37:59] but as the years ticked along and as
[2:38:01] life became more prosperous even for the
[2:38:04] exile
[2:38:05] they longed to stay right where they
[2:38:07] were
[2:38:08] and when the news came only a few left
[2:38:11] with the first and only a few left with
[2:38:12] a second and only a few left with the
[2:38:14] third
[2:38:16] there were at least a hundred thousand
[2:38:18] people
[2:38:20] a hundred thousand out of a hundred and
[2:38:22] fifty thousand that chose to remain
[2:38:25] behind only one third 50 000 people the
[2:38:29] bible says the number is 47 000
[2:38:33] something and and nearly 3 000 singers
[2:38:36] and priests and so forth but just common
[2:38:38] men and women about 47 000 of them
[2:38:42] decided to go home leaving a hundred
[2:38:45] thousand israelites
[2:38:47] in a land that had been
[2:38:49] uh
[2:38:51] slavery
[2:38:52] exile
[2:38:53] to them can you imagine the offer is
[2:38:56] made the invitation is made just like
[2:38:58] it's made here
[2:39:01] sunday after sunday won't you come
[2:39:05] won't you let him change your heart
[2:39:08] won't you let him soften the hardness
[2:39:11] of your life won't you come won't you
[2:39:14] worship won't you enter in
[2:39:16] won't you come home
[2:39:21] and some
[2:39:22] no thanks
[2:39:25] i'm okay right where i am
[2:39:28] the problem is we forget to notify our
[2:39:30] faces that we're all right where we are
[2:39:34] the way you look the the
[2:39:37] sadness
[2:39:39] the emptiness the coldness
[2:39:42] on people's faces testifies
[2:39:45] that they're not happy in babylon
[2:39:47] they're not happy underneath the burden
[2:39:49] of all the stuff they carry that you
[2:39:52] just don't have to carry anymore
[2:39:55] because there's been a way made for you
[2:39:57] don't breathe anymore
[2:39:59] somebody said i i just can't do it that
[2:40:01] quick just because you say so i can't
[2:40:03] just get out from under it then god's
[2:40:05] word is a lie
[2:40:07] and none of us ought to be following it
[2:40:11] because he said cast it all
[2:40:16] get rid of it
[2:40:18] the man who could have been the most
[2:40:20] bitter
[2:40:21] in the early church said rejoice
[2:40:26] don't worry about my my bondage don't
[2:40:29] worry about my shackles
[2:40:32] don't be troubled about my change
[2:40:34] rejoice
[2:40:41] you're afraid to say amen
[2:40:46] the scripture does not say that joy is
[2:40:48] our strength
[2:40:57] there's no way in the world you can get
[2:40:58] over it that quick
[2:41:02] trying to grunt
[2:41:05] until you can get joy
[2:41:08] it don't work that way
[2:41:10] but the bible doesn't say joy is your
[2:41:12] strength
[2:41:14] the bible says there's a joy that is of
[2:41:15] divine origin
[2:41:18] there's a joy that doesn't come from you
[2:41:21] it comes from the one who lives
[2:41:24] within you
[2:41:26] it's not your emotional
[2:41:28] you know effort that gives you joy
[2:41:31] it's surrendering all that is unlike joy
[2:41:35] it's choosing joy
[2:41:37] as a strategic position
[2:41:42] not basing it on your condition
[2:41:45] but choosing it
[2:41:47] as a strategic
[2:41:49] position
[2:41:51] you see joy is not a luxury are you
[2:41:52] still with me i'm almost i'm almost
[2:41:55] joy's not a luxury
[2:41:57] it's necessary
[2:41:59] joy of the lord the joy of the lord is a
[2:42:02] byproduct of obedience
[2:42:05] you obey and you can have the joy of the
[2:42:06] lord you obey and you can have the joy
[2:42:09] of the lord we cannot continue to grieve
[2:42:11] over the past it is time to continue our
[2:42:14] journey
[2:42:16] to do exactly what ezra the priest said
[2:42:18] go our way
[2:42:20] and rejoice at the goodness of god
[2:42:22] but but but but but but but but but but
[2:42:27] but
[2:42:30] come on
[2:42:31] come on
[2:42:34] i don't have to tell you who does all
[2:42:36] the button
[2:42:39] you are not the exception to the rule of
[2:42:41] god's word he sent his word to you
[2:42:44] he sent his word to you he sent his word
[2:42:47] to you as soon as you get over the need
[2:42:49] to be understood
[2:42:52] and you make up your mind
[2:42:55] the church didn't give it to me

[2:48:08] but i want you to know there comes a
[2:48:10] time when we have to get up and live on
[2:48:14] where we have to make up our mind it's
[2:48:16] time to obey the lord in all things
[2:48:19] because joy is a byproduct of obedience
[2:48:23] all right i'm closing i want ladies
[2:48:26] give me this message please and then
[2:48:28] i'll stop witnesses jeffersonville
[2:48:30] indiana 1953
[2:48:32] musicians are coming
[2:48:34] even though my girls
[2:48:36] let me know last night that
[2:48:39] even calling the musicians is not a
[2:48:41] signal that i'm finished
[2:48:51] there were some people one time
[2:48:53] the jews
[2:48:54] from the tribe of judah where they got
[2:48:56] their name because they wouldn't walk
[2:48:59] after the ordinances of god wouldn't
[2:49:01] keep his commandments god called king
[2:49:03] nebuchadnezzar to come in and to take
[2:49:05] them captive
[2:49:07] down into the land of babylon many of us
[2:49:10] remember remember the famous old story
[2:49:14] of how they hung their harps on the
[2:49:16] willow tree
[2:49:17] the weeping willow tree
[2:49:19] and they could not sing the songs of
[2:49:21] zion
[2:49:22] all their victory was
[2:49:26] lost not because that god wanted to take
[2:49:28] it away from them
[2:49:30] but because of their sin
[2:49:32] separated them
[2:49:34] from god
[2:49:35] that's the reason tonight
[2:49:38] that many of the christians hasn't got
[2:49:40] the victory let's go on
[2:49:44] that's the reason tonight that many of
[2:49:45] the christians hasn't got the victory
[2:49:47] it's because their sins have separated
[2:49:49] them from the blessing
[2:49:51] honey it's all it can be it's all it can
[2:49:54] be surely you wouldn't let anything else
[2:49:56] stand between you and your joy
[2:49:59] surely you wouldn't let anybody stand
[2:50:01] between you and the victory
[2:50:03] my lord have mercy if you really caught
[2:50:05] a vision of somebody trying to keep you
[2:50:07] from the victory
[2:50:11] you'd quarterback them
[2:50:14] you'd shove them right over come on now
[2:50:17] so there's only one thing that could be
[2:50:18] keeping people from getting back they've
[2:50:20] allowed their feelings
[2:50:25] to produce unbelief
[2:50:27] because that's what sin is that doesn't
[2:50:29] mean they're drinking smoking running
[2:50:30] around on their wife or their husband
[2:50:32] doesn't mean they're guilty of any of
[2:50:33] those things it just means they've
[2:50:35] allowed unbelief to start creeping up in
[2:50:37] their heart and when you do that you'll
[2:50:39] never get back to the joy until you cut
[2:50:41] that thing off so there's a time for
[2:50:43] repentance but when god is calling you
[2:50:45] back to the homeland come on
[2:50:47] come on
[2:50:50] come on don't let pride or anything else
[2:50:53] keep you from making your way back
[2:50:55] he said that's the reason tonight many
[2:50:57] of the christians hasn't got the
[2:50:58] victories because their sins has
[2:51:00] separated them from the blessing cut off
[2:51:01] out in the desert place alone and our
[2:51:04] hearts are hanging on the weeping willow
[2:51:05] tree because we can't enjoy whoa
[2:51:11] no wonder people look like they're dying
[2:51:12] sometime when we sing the praises of
[2:51:14] zion around here
[2:51:16] that's why
[2:51:21] we've got our hearts hanging on a willow
[2:51:23] tree
[2:51:24] and we can't enjoy the songs of zion
[2:51:26] come on come home
[2:51:29] come
[2:51:30] home you you you mean you want me to
[2:51:33] walk down there i'm not asking you to do
[2:51:35] any of the sword
[2:51:36] you don't have to come up here to come
[2:51:39] home to god
[2:51:40] you can come home right where you stand
[2:51:42] right where you sit you can come home
[2:51:44] once you get home to your temporary
[2:51:46] house
[2:51:48] you can turn your heart back to god and
[2:51:51] get that grub hole out and get rid of
[2:51:53] that unbelief you can do that you can do
[2:51:56] that without the preacher
[2:51:59] you can do that without your brother and
[2:52:00] sister you can do that in your own home
[2:52:03] with nobody looking
[2:52:05] then how's anybody going to know i've
[2:52:07] made a change
[2:52:15] don't ask such a silly question
[2:52:18] jehovah of miracles
[2:52:22] paragraph 49 we're nearly done play
[2:52:24] something solved
[2:52:27] one to what
[2:52:30] this is paragraph 49 he's not finishing
[2:52:33] he's just getting started tongues and
[2:52:34] interpretation given praise the lord
[2:52:37] praise the lord
[2:52:42] branham didn't call this down
[2:52:44] brother branham didn't subject this to
[2:52:45] church order and tell them they were out
[2:52:47] of order for letting this happen
[2:52:49] he received it as the lord sometimes the
[2:52:51] lord
[2:52:52] it should never be that the lord has to
[2:52:53] push his way in
[2:52:57] he said praise the lord praise the lord
[2:53:00] the joy of the lord
[2:53:02] is our strength isn't it
[2:53:04] that's our strength
[2:53:06] he said that's how we live
[2:53:08] it's by the joy of the lord
[2:53:11] that's in our midst
[2:53:13] anybody want to say amen
[2:53:16] in the message why beaumont texas down
[2:53:18] for brother green
[2:53:21] paragraph 41 but because that we do it
[2:53:25] that's the reason we're cursed that's
[2:53:27] the reason god puts this thing upon the
[2:53:29] church cold and dampness
[2:53:32] we're going to other places for pleasure
[2:53:34] instead of coming to the house of the
[2:53:35] lord for pleasure
[2:53:38] the house of the lord listen listen look
[2:53:40] at that
[2:53:43] the house of the lord is the joy
[2:53:46] of the lord
[2:53:49] why would brother branham make such a
[2:53:50] statement as that somebody said that's a
[2:53:52] big mistake it's not a mistake at all
[2:53:55] because there's nothing like coming
[2:53:56] together with god's people and entering
[2:54:00] in in faith and experiencing the
[2:54:03] corporate anointing that comes just like
[2:54:06] it did this morning
[2:54:08] the joy of the lord is the joy of his
[2:54:10] people
[2:54:12] he wants you to come to church and
[2:54:13] worship him and be happy and satisfied
[2:54:16] giving praise and honor and glory and
[2:54:18] wisdom and might and power to god he
[2:54:21] wants you to do that
[2:54:25] one more
[2:54:27] christ knocking at the door
[2:54:29] i've been wanting to read this for three
[2:54:31] weeks he's i'm going to keep some of
[2:54:33] them back but this is what i'm getting
[2:54:35] out
[2:54:36] paragraph 51
[2:54:37] stand with me
[2:54:40] stretch your weary legs
[2:54:48] don't you just love to worship
[2:54:51] this is brother venom
[2:54:54] don't you just love to worship
[2:54:57] the messages sometimes are so cutting
[2:54:59] with the word
[2:55:01] but then you know after we've all been
[2:55:03] corrected
[2:55:05] and stand guiltless in the presence of
[2:55:08] the father
[2:55:09] oh
[2:55:11] my
[2:55:14] do i need the word
[2:55:17] do i need the word do i need the word to
[2:55:20] correct me do i need the word to wash me
[2:55:23] do i need the word to cleanse me do i
[2:55:25] need the word to purify me am i the only
[2:55:28] one that needs to sit under that word
[2:55:31] and be cleansed and purified and washed
[2:55:34] all the week
[2:55:36] [Music]
[2:55:38] the monday the tuesday the wednesday the
[2:55:40] thursday the friday the saturday
[2:55:44] i need all that washed off of me and
[2:55:46] that's what the word does
[2:55:50] when that word comes like that and you
[2:55:51] say amen
[2:55:53] doesn't matter how guilty you are when
[2:55:55] you can squeeze out an amen you are
[2:55:58] saying so be it and you are absolutely
[2:56:01] bringing yourself under the cleansing
[2:56:03] power of a word that might be offending
[2:56:05] your mind
[2:56:07] [Music]
[2:56:08] but you know it's the truth anyway
[2:56:10] and so with faith you say amen and when
[2:56:13] you do that effect of the word is to
[2:56:16] cleanse you and you stand in that moment
[2:56:19] you see we have got that pentecostal
[2:56:22] mindset i've got to come down to the
[2:56:24] front i've got to be have hands laid on
[2:56:26] me i've got to be prayed for i've got to
[2:56:28] tell the preacher what my problem is
[2:56:29] he's got to pray with sincerity for a
[2:56:31] few minutes and then it's all taken care
[2:56:32] of and i'm going to go out that's wrong
[2:56:35] that's the mentality of the denomination
[2:56:38] it's it's not the mentality of the
[2:56:40] revealed word we don't mind we don't
[2:56:43] mind to pray with you
[2:56:44] it's our joy to pray with you but i
[2:56:46] don't just wait till sunday morning to
[2:56:47] pray with you
[2:56:49] i pray over your needs all through the
[2:56:51] week because that's what we feel to do
[2:56:53] we're called to do it's part of our not
[2:56:55] not just our responsibility it's part of
[2:56:57] our joy to do that but you get you get
[2:57:00] something every time you come into
[2:57:02] agreement with the word
[2:57:03] and i want to say it again especially if
[2:57:05] it offends your mind if the preacher is
[2:57:08] preaching something that offends your
[2:57:09] mind and you are able with your whole
[2:57:12] being
[2:57:14] to say amen
[2:57:16] so be it
[2:57:17] it's truth anyway
[2:57:19] you bring yourself under the
[2:57:20] effectiveness of that word it's powerful
[2:57:22] the power of agreement
[2:57:27] if i preach on an ear bob and somebody
[2:57:29] with a nearby bone says amen
[2:57:34] that's the right thing to do
[2:57:36] if i say such and such a thing and you
[2:57:38] that kind of makes you want to buck up a
[2:57:40] little bit but you know it's the truth
[2:57:43] at least internally
[2:57:45] say amen amen i know it's right i know
[2:57:47] it's right i'm not been to doing it but
[2:57:49] i know it's right
[2:57:51] then you stand corrected and you stand
[2:57:53] guiltless in the presence of the father
[2:57:55] that's a powerful quote
[2:57:57] resting upon the grace
[2:57:59] of the lord jesus but i didn't come to
[2:58:01] the altar but i didn't pray but the
[2:58:03] elders didn't lay hands on me the word
[2:58:05] the word did it the word cleansed you
[2:58:08] the word helped you the word corrected
[2:58:10] you
[2:58:12] the homeland
[2:58:13] [Applause]
[2:58:15] you made it back to the homeland
[2:58:19] guiltless
[2:58:21] in the presence of the father resting
[2:58:22] upon the grace of the lord jesus he said
[2:58:24] i just love to raise my hands
[2:58:31] and worship him
[2:58:32] he said don't you like to do that how
[2:58:34] many believes in that raise up your
[2:58:36] hands oh my
[2:58:38] just worship him
[2:58:40] in song
[2:58:44] you're standing now so i can read one
[2:58:45] more patmos vision 268.
[2:58:48] these were the two i've been wanting to
[2:58:49] read for three weeks
[2:58:52] do you love him
[2:58:54] paragraph 268 papa's vision do you love
[2:58:56] him
[2:58:57] you know after the message is cutting
[2:58:59] and everything
[2:59:01] i like to hear the people get into the
[2:59:02] hymns
[2:59:06] you old grumble bucket
[2:59:09] well now he preaches till after one now
[2:59:11] and then we have to sing for another 30
[2:59:13] minutes
[2:59:17] just tell the truth you didn't want to
[2:59:18] be here in the first place
[2:59:21] but you're not getting my praise
[2:59:25] you're not getting mine
[2:59:27] i can't afford to let you i love you but
[2:59:29] i can't afford to let you get my praise
[2:59:32] i can't afford to let you steal my joy
[2:59:34] i'm going to need it tomorrow
[2:59:36] i'm going to need the joy of the lord
[2:59:38] tomorrow i'm going to need it i'm going
[2:59:39] to need it to get through the week i'm
[2:59:41] going to need it when the calls start
[2:59:43] coming in and the people's needs are
[2:59:45] great i'm going to need the joy of the
[2:59:47] lord when discouragement comes and
[2:59:49] depression tries to come i'm going to
[2:59:51] need the joy of the lord
[2:59:53] he said do you love him you know after
[2:59:55] the message is cutting everything i like
[2:59:57] to hear the people get into the hymns
[2:59:59] and go to worshipping and singing in the
[3:00:01] spirit there's nothing more prettier
[3:00:03] than good old singing
[3:00:06] that's right
[3:00:09] i love good old-fashioned pentecostal
[3:00:13] singing
[3:00:14] not them overtrained voices that holds
[3:00:16] till they're speaking
[3:00:18] squeaking and turn blue in the face and
[3:00:20] don't know what they're singing
[3:00:23] i like somebody that maybe couldn't
[3:00:24] carry a tune in a basket but he gets
[3:00:26] under a pentecostal blessing
[3:00:29] he's got a pentecostal blessing now he's
[3:00:31] singing about it oh how glorious those
[3:00:33] melodious songs of the cross oh my oh my
[3:00:37] does that sound like some old stiff
[3:00:38] baptist preacher to you
[3:00:41] that's the prophet of god that that's
[3:00:43] the one who carried the elijah spirit
[3:00:45] to his generation and to us he's the one
[3:00:50] he wasn't the only one god used but he
[3:00:52] was the one that god chose for that job
[3:00:54] and so they try to make him starchy and
[3:00:57] they try to say he didn't believe in
[3:00:58] speaking in tongues and they try to say
[3:01:00] he didn't believe in shouting and
[3:01:02] dancing and carrying on like that but we
[3:01:04] don't listen anymore because we've read
[3:01:06] what he said and we've heard what he
[3:01:08] said and we know that there was nothing
[3:01:10] that thrilled in any more than to get
[3:01:12] into the presence of the lord he
[3:01:13] believed the word should have the
[3:01:15] preeminence he believed the most
[3:01:16] important part of the service was the
[3:01:18] preaching of the word but once you get
[3:01:20] out from under that
[3:01:22] you sing before the word to prepare the
[3:01:24] atmosphere for the word to go forth but
[3:01:26] once that word has gone forth he said
[3:01:28] you come in to sing and rejoice and
[3:01:30] worship and it seals that word into your
[3:01:32] heart so that it doesn't leak out
[3:01:38] sing it sing something
[3:01:42] let's worship together before we go
[3:01:43] today god bless
[3:01:46] [Music]
[3:02:00] it's a strategic
[3:02:04] [Music]
[3:02:22] your loving kindness
[3:02:26] tore through the shadows
