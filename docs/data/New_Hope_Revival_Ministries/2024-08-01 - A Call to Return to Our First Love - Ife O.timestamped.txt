[0:00] because iniquity is abounding around us
[0:04] because generational sins are taking
[0:08] over the age that we live in it's like
[0:12] something has breathed cool air frigid
[0:17] air on our love and we are no longer
[0:21] capable of loving one another the way we
[0:24] should the way that we have been loved
[0:27] because the spiritual temperature has
[0:31] been so affected in the atmosphere of
[0:34] This World by iniquity iniquity has
[0:38] taken such a stronghold in our land that
[0:43] it's like the enemy himself has breathed
[0:47] cool air and it has dried out our love
[0:51] it has chilled or made our love be
[0:55] almost Frozen and when love is frozen it
[0:58] can't be given it can't be shared it
[1:01] becomes solid it becomes dry it's no
[1:04] longer exchangeable how many of you know
[1:07] we don't only want to receive his agape
[1:10] love but we want to exchange it we want
[1:12] to share it we want it to flow through
[1:15] us to the brothers first to the
[1:18] household of faith first but also to a
[1:21] world that's dying and going to a
[1:25] devil's
[1:26] hell the enemy the spirit of the age has
[1:30] breathed on the love of the church this
[1:33] isn't husband wife love this is God's
[1:36] love to us our love to one another
[1:38] therefore all men shall know that they
[1:40] are my
[1:42] disciples because they make all the
[1:44] right
[1:45] quotations no because they have love one
[1:49] for
[1:51] another and love would rather take the
[1:55] blame than to excuse themselves and push
[2:00] the blame on someone else if we're in
[2:03] that kind of a family and we
[2:05] are if we're in that kind of family
[2:08] there's only one solution for us and
[2:11] that is to pray like wild men pray like
[2:14] wild women that the fire of the Holy
[2:17] Ghost will burn so
[2:21] hot so bright so hot so powerful that it
[2:26] thaws out our Frozen love
[2:30] amen come on greater love hath no man
[2:34] than this that a man would lay down his
[2:37] life for his friends Jesus did that on
[2:40] our behalf but sometimes we have to do
[2:43] that for one another because not to do
[2:46] it would be to expose someone in a way
[2:49] they don't particularly need to be
[2:51] exposed in such an hour as this cold
[2:54] love will shut down prayer it shifts
[2:57] Godly worship to Will worship and it
[3:01] will disable the flow of the healing
[3:03] virtue in a church sickness will prevail
[3:07] in a house where Frozen Love is the
[3:13] stronghold the real
[3:15] cause of waxing cold in your love is
[3:21] because you leave your first
[3:25] love if you emphatically hold on to
[3:29] Jesus as the number one love of your
[3:35] life you will so value his love for you
[3:41] that you long to be a
[3:43] pipeline you long to be a conduit for
[3:47] that love to flow through
[3:49] you that kind of love doesn't keep a
[3:52] record of
[3:56] wrongs that kind of love doesn't behave
[3:59] itself
[4:01] unseemly that kind of love doesn't get
[4:04] puffed up I want to tell you something
[4:08] folks years of service for the Lord it
[4:13] doesn't give us a free
[4:16] pass it doesn't mean that we don't have
[4:18] to keep
[4:20] fighting and when you get really in love
[4:23] with him you start looking for an excuse
[4:26] to be in his presence
[4:31] instead of looking for an excuse not to
[4:33] I understand when people are made to
[4:35] work but I don't understand people
[4:37] volunteering to work and missing a
[4:40] service that I don't understand if we're
[4:44] ever going to get back to a RedHot love
[4:47] for one
[4:48] another first we're going to have to get
[4:50] back to when he was
[4:53] our what does it mean to be first loved
[4:56] it means to love him above and be Beyond
[5:01] yes sir my number
[5:03] one
[5:05] affection my number one love my number
[5:10] one priority is Jesus Christ you've
[5:14] allowed your love to grow cold because
[5:16] you have
[5:17] left the reason why you started in the
[5:21] first
[5:23] place was
[5:26] him it was him
