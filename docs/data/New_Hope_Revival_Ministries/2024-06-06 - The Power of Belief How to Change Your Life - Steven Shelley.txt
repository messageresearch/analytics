Description:
Unlocking God's Promises Through Faith

In this inspiring message, discover the transformative power of your "Amen." Learn how this simple word can personalize God's word in your life, turning His truths into promises specifically for you. Overcome doubt, embrace faith, and unlock God's blessings through the power of your belief.

Key takeaways from this video:

Your "Amen" is a personal declaration of faith. It's a way of saying "so be it" to God's promises, allowing them to take root in your heart and life.
Don't let unworthiness hold you back. God isn't looking at your mistakes; He's looking at your faith.
Speak the Word of God with boldness and conviction. When you speak God's word with no doubt in your heart, you activate His power in your life.
Hold on to God's promises, even when you don't see the evidence. Trust that God will keep His word in His perfect timing.
Your faith can move mountains. Believe in the power of God's promises and watch Him work miracles in your life.
Join us as we delve into the power of your "Amen" and learn how to unlock God's promises through unwavering faith.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I believe in the power of your amen I believe your amen makes the word of God personal to you I believe when you hear a truth that you believe in and you say Amen you don't have to scream it so loud you send other people off the Pew but you speak it out of your mouth and that word means amen means what it means so be it and because it's a personal expression between you in the Lord you're actually saying and so let it be in my life I believe that's the truth and so let it be in my life so many times when the word of God Goes Forth we disqualify ourselves from receiving it and we think of all the reasons why we're not worthy of that promise or why we may not have that in our life or what what we have done or the mistakes that we have made God's not looking at your mistake he's looking at your faith if you're going to speak the word Jesus says the prerequisite for doing that is to make sure that there is no doubt no doubt in your heart otherwise you pray and you ask the Lord Lord I believe help thou my unbelief that's how we should pray we should really pray that way now Lord I know you can I believe you will I I I do but help me help me in my unbelief help me in my doubt but if you're going to rise up and the bride will the prophet told us that in that last day the bride will have thus saith the Lord and she will keep still until she has thus sayith the Lord and when she has it she will do exactly what is spoken and God will bring that to pass in her life so we're going to shake some mountains in the last of the last days and we're shaking mountains now through prayer but we're coming to a place of recognized Authority is anybody here when we begin to recognize our Authority it won't be asking anymore it won't be begging or petitioning anymore but a revelation will rise up in your heart this is the will of God and you will decree a thing the Bible said and what you decree without doubt in your heart will will it has to come to pass if you can say the right thing instead of the wrong thing God will do exactly what he said he was going to do for you if God told you he had given you a companion you hold on to the promise of of God and believe that in the right season in the DU time God will keep his word are you going to get through that problem that you're going through right now have you got any evidence that you're going to are you going to get out from under depression are you going to trust God to help you off of those anxiety drugs are you going to put God to the test and believe him do you have any evidence then what is it help me help me help me help yourself God said so God said so do you hear that devil God said [Music] so he said I'm going to give you your children and your children are going to serve me do you have any evidence that they're turning toward the lord now not with the natural eye in fact the natural eye is they get meaner every day don't pray that they'll that they will know suffering and heartache and and humility and and be humiliated don't don't pray such a prayer as that but don't always pray them out of every situation they find themselves in trust God believe that he has given you a promise
