thank you Lord we give you praise Lord for you are worthy y you're worthy Lord hallelujah you may have your seats today what a blessing to be able to gather in the house of the Lord with the saints of God how he has ministered to us and got us through sicknesses and let us be able to come back to the house of the Lord continues to help us how great he is we're going to receive the tithe and the offering today to give to the Lord he's uh wonderful and worthy and he has been the one who has provided for us everything that we have anything that we have is because of him any abilities that we have is because of him and we want to give him the the praise and we want to keep Covenant with him in our tithe and in our offering uh just a a little brief update to you uh we don't tell everything that is going on I am one who a lot of times like to try to stay under the radar and uh so I don't tell everything I know and uh the the enemy likes to twist and distort and do all sorts of things and so anyhow um we we mentioned that we're trying to get something going down under the Tabernacle I would like to give the Lord Praise because we have successfully uh gotten the poll uh passed by the Lee County building inspections department and after brother Shelley spent probably over an hour on the telephone this week this week to get tpusa to hook up that poll uh and give them quite a bit of money to hook up to that poll that is successfully done and we will expect that it will be hooked up this week and so we give the Lord praise for that so um when I went initially I I'm going to I'm going to give you a confession today when I went initially to the building inspections department I was trying to give them reference where the pole was and I said it's near a open steel structure well for whatever reason the lady said are you going to wire that structure and I said no the structure is already wired but there's no power to it well I lost sleep over it and the Lord dealt with me see that's what the word does that's what the word does it brings conviction to us the goodness of God in our lives brings us to conviction and keeps us on the way of Holiness the straight way because we don't want to be fallen in one ditch or the other ditch we want to stay right on the the straight place that the Lord has ordained for us and so when I I called the following day after I knew the inspector had been here to look at the poll they were supposed to have sent me an email to verify that that poll had been uh accepted or rejected and I did not get the email so I called back to the building inspections department and I asked about it and she said yes it has been passed and it's already been sent to talapa to let them know that it has passed and then I asked to speak to the building inspector and he called me back later and I asked him if he would meet me underneath of the Tabernacle well in that meeting everything underneath of that structure had to be updated so this week there has been a lot of uh uh all the old lights are gone uh there's all the old wiring is gone and so it's having to be completely uh rewired and that is for our safety and uh we're expecting a second uh inspection in coming days and weeks as we get that completed but we're trying by God's grace to get a place where we can meet together and not have to go off of the eagle Refuge we just want to have a place where that we can meet together and have Fellowship so that is what is going on I tell you that because we uh we want you to keep giving we even though it it you're not you may not be seeing anything it's happening it is happening by the grace of God and so we're we're going to need a lot of help uh in coming weeks uh I haven't asked this week because I wasn't going to subject you to the cold I don't mind subjecting myself but I wasn't going to ask you but as it gets warmer we're going to have to start asking for some of your help and I gave him the option hard Choice he made the hard choice and went and worked when I wasn't there and I appreciate it so much so we're grateful that God is he is helping us and we continue to move forward in the things of the Lord more than anything else we want to hear the voice of God in our ears we want to hear what he has for us in this house as the preaching is going out from this place we want to hear what the spirit is saying to the church and we want to stay right in line with it so with that if you brought your tithe and offering with you today we want to give you opportunity to give to the Lord Stephen would you help us and brother Ellas would you help us and let's give as giving unto the Lord I would like to sing redeemed sweet as the song I'm singing today prise the Lord Two Flats here sweet is the song I'm singing today I'm redeemed I'm redeemed trouble and sorrow have vanished away I have been I have been redeemed oh I'm redeemed my love divine Oh Glory Glory Christ is all to him I now reside I have been I have been redeemed great is my joy as onward I go I'm redeemed I'm redeemed all the way Homeward my Praises shall blow I have been I have been redeemed oh I'm redeemed by love divine Oh Glory Glory

happy Glory someday I shall be I have been I have been let's sing it like we need it oh I'm redeem by love divine by love divine my love divine Oh Glory Glory Glory Christ is is all to him I now I have been I have been [Music] [Applause] redeemed how many of you Redeemed by love divine you know you are yes you may be seated you don't have to ask anybody you know you are it's the blood that's done the work the life in the blood and Grace was the vehicle that brought the blood to you Hallelujah so if you should hear the prophet say it wasn't the blood just know that it was the blood it takes the blood grace alone could never do it right it was grace that brought the token blood to you so the blood cleanses us and Grace brings it to our door aren't you glad that Grace and the blood cooperate together you you've got to look at the whole picture you can't take one sentence and miss the whole thing when I first came around this truth there were those who uh wouldn't wouldn't sing about the blood anymore and and I said oh my have we become so false that we can't sing about the precious blood I can give you so many things about that blood and we know how precious it is and it hasn't lost its power but the blood would have just been out there and you wouldn't have had any way to get to it it's not the chemistry of the blood but it's the life that's in the blood but Grace come along like a choo choo train picked up the life of the blood and brought it all the way to your doorstep and dropped it right off now if you can explain it better than that I'll let you but I see it that way way I'm thankful for I'm redeemed not just saved there's a church out there and some of them are saved the Bible said whosoever believeth and calleth on the name of the Lord shall be saved we're not just talking about salvation we're talking about another step and that's the step of redemption and that takes you all the way back to the original thoughts of God about you when he saw you when he knew knew you when he saw you when he knew every choice you would ever make he knew what you would be doing on January the 2st 2024 and he made provision for your life and he made provision for your Redemption and we are so thankful for that if you're thankful give him a [Applause] praise Hallelujah we greet all of you who are streaming this service this morning in the matchless name of the Lord Jesus Christ we're so thankful that you have joined us from so many places around the world may God bless you today in the same manner that He blesses the body of Christ that's gathered here locally I want to thank the Lord that the nearly uh foot of snow that came to Pennsylvania came this weekend and not last weekend we have so much to thank God for and uh we had plenty we had enough to get around we didn't have to stop we could keep moving but you know that's a lot of snow on country roads and uh we're thankful we told you uh that that uh we were glad to get out when we did but I found myself missing uh uh the people this week and and you know it's the character of the people the the beautiful thing about the church is the character of God's people I want you to know we are blessed to know that his life within us produces character and if you haven't come to that maturity yet keep pressing keep pressing because it's still available for you God is still in the sanctifying business I only have one birthday on my calendar for this week and that is Landon May hold hold up your hand is he in here hold up your hand so I can't hardly see that far back I do see your hand not your face though and he is turning I don't think you call it sweet for boys he is turning 16 he's turning manly 16 how about that not sweet 16 let's wish him a happy birthday on Wednesday I'm trying to figure out how Gregory and Samantha got old so fast to have a 16year old boy that I'm telling you that hit you that Gob smacked you when you realize that your babies are not babies anymore and now you've got 11 16 and you got several coming right along behind them I pray that he has a good birthday I want to remind you we did pray but I want to remind you you that uh that we should uh be praying and sharing and inviting people to come to the meetings and that is the first weekend of April excuse me February I had the the SEC the next set on my mind uh that is the 3 and the 4th of February Saturday night and Sunday morning and we're looking forward to What the Lord Has for us seemed like it's been months since we had a fellowship time together but it's not only two months and uh we're looking forward to February and April and I'm already looking forward to camp meeting and uh what all God has for us this year and uh the the the changes that we're going to be making to the Tabernacle you should understand that they are semi-permanent we're putting a semi-permanent solution in place and when we say that we we just simply mean it won't be the final solution but it's a step in the right Direction and uh that building is to be used for the glory of God I don't know I have to be honest with you I don't know whether it will ever be used for a camp meeting service again I don't know that it could possibly be we have precious Promises of what God's going to do for us at camp meeting doesn't matter to me whether he does them he's not limited to a building it doesn't matter to me whether he does them down there or whether he does them up here but we have have h a lot of money in that building and it sits there empty and has for a long time and uh rather than starting from scratch we feel like it would be better we would be better stewards of what God has given us if we started working so we're going to one end of it and we're going to start working across and we're going to see what God has for us somebody said what about this Vision or what about that Vision well just let me say one thing to you I had a vision concerning the multip purpose use of this building and in it many years ago there were printing presses I am not expecting that part of the vision to ever be fulfilled Oho it's got quiet because we don't need printing presses we don't need them anymore we get printers and binders and we can print all the books we want without a big printing press I uh when when but what I saw in the vision was at that time that's how you would have produced some books is through a printing press and did you know that the voice of God does not own a printing press did you know that all the printing presses are gone out of that building every one of them gone they don't even need them they don't use them anymore printing a book to them is an obsolete thing there are no no more books of the message being printed I don't know if you knew that or not they're not necessary anymore because they have a tablet that is available that you can have you don't even have to have a tablet you can download them from your phone print them if you want to I mean this is incredible you you don't have to wait on a book I used to order books and wait on the books to come order tapes and wait on the tapes to come now everything you need is at your fingertip that is not a shame somebody said what a shame you you've got African pastors who now have the ability to communicate with one another who never could communicate with one another before because they hold a tablet in their hand that has communication ability and if one gets a translation of a sermon he has the ability to send it to all of his brothers just say for instance they don't have Wi-Fi there is a communication system built in those tablets that go overseas that he has the ability to send a sermon to another tablet without Wii now you know that's something else and so I do believe that we will have books in fact I'm going to quote from one today but uh we won't need a printing press to do it well then the vision wasn't correct well you can have that attitude if you want to but you might get in trouble with the Lord the goal of that is to have books available whether we have a big old obsolete printing press to print them on or not or whether we can do it with a printer or whether we just say anybody who wants a copy you have it on a PDF how many of you saw that the PDF of brother Perry Green's testimony RJ has added that to the app did you get the message so you can go to your app you can download that I assume is that right we can down download it you can download it you can print it and you've got the PDF you've got the book you don't need to have a a a printed copy available you print your own copy if you can't print if you don't have a printer we'll do it for you we don't mind to do that and uh maybe the printer that we bought from Amazon back there won't be uh big enough to do the job that we will do in the future but we'll have what we need in the right time if you believe that say amen am so don't lament because something doesn't happen exactly the way we expect it to happen as long as it happens as long as God gets the glory as long as what is available what he desires to be available to the people is available I am all right with that we need a place to be together Fellowship is a part of of of New Testament Christianity they met in homes they fell fellowship with one another they broke bread together and we need that Fellowship so I am very excited and we will tell you more about the project as it as it moves forward the truth is we don't know all there is to know about it yet and and because ideas or have come and changes are already made to those ideas please understand that we're not trying to keep anything from you that you need to know there's nothing going on under the table here we just don't know didn't you hear brother gy say we want leadership we want leadership in every detail cuz we don't have to do it we don't want to have to do it twice and we don't want to do it wrong and have to turn around and do it right we want to be good stewards of what God's put in our hands I had a wonderful thing happen to me this morning uh as I was looking through the week and Landon's birthday was the only birthday you know on on on calendars when you use the Apple calendar or Google Calendar it gives you the option of repeating that so if I put your birthday in I can put repeat that every year and every year I won't have to copy and pay it'll be there your birthday will be there well I did that many years ago Church payment due 21st of the month Church payment due and I enjoyed myself immensely when I looked at the calendar today and it said Church payment do and I said no no it ain't no it ain't God has made the way I'm thankful are you thankful for the musicians everything they do and the worship leading God bless you all let's stand I only have about 3 hours of material today so we'll try to be through in at least 2 hours and 50 minutes we'll trim it down not many laughs this morning I can tell you're struggling I'm going to be on watch I have this sneaky suspicion that there are those Among Us who were up late perhaps watching the playoff offs like anybody really cares if you fall asleep I'm going to call your name and if I miss what kept you up that don't matter this is not the hotel they sit in the memory foam this is get ourselves trained because we have no idea what we're about to face in many many ways can you say Amen am we're praying every day for Israel we're praying every day for Jerusalem things are opening up on the Northern front there were there were uh some terrorists taken out yesterday in Damascus which should settle the thought in people's minds does Israel have the potential of reaching Damascus that's settled can they take out a vehicle with terrorists without without harming anything else yes the technology is there that is settled and will continue to to play out uh there are also targets that are being eliminated on the northern border just across in into Lebanon both Hamas because some of the leaders have fled there to the to the to the northern part which would be the southern part of Lebanon the northern part of Israel and also Hezbollah and those of you who know anything about what's going on in the world Hezbollah has many more times the potential and the Weaponry to engage in a long-term battle and that is because they are they are backed by by Iran and uh they already have the the weapons in hand so we have to pray for the North and the South we have to pray for Syria to the north uh East and we have to believe that God will continue to watch over his people and especially any hostages that may yet be alive and we believe there are some that are may God watch over them and keep them this is our prayer whether we mention it every service or not it's our daily life we watch it and we pray so I'm going to preach uh today and and the theme is going to be praise until the spirit of worship comes worship until the glory comes and then stand in the glory I'm going to read 2 Chronicles 5 beginning in verse 12 and I would appreciate all the sacrifices of amens that you could possibly produce today because we are in a time of of spiritual something something is stirred it's not all it's not all good it's not all beautiful there's some Darkness that's being pushed back with our our prayers with our praise with our worship there are spirits that are being pushed back because of prayer and praise and worship and we must keep doing them because they're not welcome in this house and they're not welcome to touch your life and we want you to to be protected and kept in times like this so help us build this atmosphere 2 Chronicles chap 5 beginning in verse 12 and the Levites which were the singers all of them of Asaf of himon of judan with their sons and their Brethren and that would be udun or udon being arrayed in white linen having symbols and suies and harps stood at the East End Of The Altar and with with them 120 priests sounding with trumpets that's a lot of noise do you know how loud trumpets are very loud 120 trumpets and singers and what were the other instruments mentioned symbols suies and harps so there's percussion instruments represented there to all of those churches struggling to keep the beat come on there's an answer to that and it doesn't have to be rock and roll there are instruments that can help you keep the beat and help you keep the Rhythm and if that ever becomes a problem tone it down or kick it out but you don't have to let fear keep you from producing anointed music for people to worship god with it goes on it came even to pass as the trumpeters and singers were as one now I want to tell you something when the musicians and the singers can work together in unison and in unity even you as a singer in the congregation this is not one person trying to overshadow someone else but this is voices Harmony his voices blending together where you can hardly hear the distinction of anyone's voice it sounds like one Voice Hallelujah it sounds like one sound and when people come together in praise and worship and release one sound the enemy is run out and the glory of the Lord is invited in Hallelujah so they were as one to to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord it's unkey yes it's not distracting and it's not self uh motivated so that you're drawing attention to yourself but it's one sound oh I can't tell you what that feels like in my feeler when I say that one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the lord and when they oh do you understand what that means it means they were no longer Whispering it was still a sacred moment it was still a holy place but they were no longer whispering to one another they lifted up their voice with the trumpets those loud trumpets and symbols and instruments of music and praise the Lord saying for he is good for his mer ain't that about what we were singing this morning for his mercy endureth forever that then then not before the praise then then the house was filled with a cloud and that cloud was the visible manifestation of the Shak the Shina Glory presence of the Lord his presence more than an emotional response or a feeling but the manifested amen tangible Glory of the Lord came into the house as a cloud even the house of the Lord so we have an example of praise until the spirit of worship comes when those voices begin to blend together see praise I know you're standing so am I praise is a very individ idual thing we do it corporately but we don't express ourselves all the same praise is individual a and it is personal and we don't all do the same right that doesn't mean we should be comfortable in our non-committal we need to commit to praise but yours may not look like somebody else's and genuine praise is not affected by your present State of Mind CU praise genuine praise has nothing to do with you your yes is all that's required your willingness is all that's required so we who praise less when we're in a storm have missed the importance of what praise can do you get in a storm you don't praise less you come to a place of Babylonian confusion and you don't praise less and we're not talking about just going through the motions we're talking about connect well I can't connect cuz I don't believe in everything that everybody else's believes in well I beat that devil I whipped him amen for 10 years God sent me on the road for 10 years all over over the world to Pentecostal and charismatic churches where 2third of what was being said I couldn't agree with it but I wasn't responsible for what they were talking about my turn was coming now had I gone in there and and not worshiped or tried to praise the Lord because I didn't like the song or the music or the song [Music] leader and I sat in some of the best Jason Upton was that his name and Joanne McFatter and and Brian and Jan Johnson from from California and uh some others that were invited to lead Worship in these places where I was speaking now they did learn that the noise you think it's loud in here you've never heard loud so they would meet me my my security team that would come and pick me out of my hotel room and Lead Me In would have a pair of earphones for me earplugs to put in I didn't even let that hinder my praise I wasn't there to say I agree with what you're doing or what you teach right right I was there on assignment and I wouldn't let my praise and My Worship be affected because it wasn't to praise the preacher or to bless the teacher or to support the worship leader I was there to praise the Lord because he is [Music] worthy Hallelujah you may be seated I I want to know what happened here here the Levites were gathered together with singers with trumpeters with symbol players those who played the Sues and the and the harps and they stood a at the dedication of the Lord's house and they began to make music unto the Lord until they did it in one voice you see praise again is an individual thing even when we do it corporately it is a conglomeration of everybody's overflow some are louder by Nature than others and some break through the barrier of their own personality and you wonder do I want to put him back in the Box because when some people burst out of their box they come out like a bull and it's good but normally it finds its place without without anybody having to legislate or pass bills with committees to hold tell people to hold it down most people once they've been out of the box a while they just find their place Hallelujah and they blend but it's individuals some sing their praise and some speak their praise and we don't get to choose the methods of Our Praise they're outlined for us in the Bible we use our voice we use our posture yes sir we use our bodies as temples and we offer them to the Lord sometimes we stand sometimes we sit are you with me sometimes we lay prostrate on the floor I had to slow down a little bit I want to make sure I got the right word there that's prostrate that's what most people call the mail problem prostrate problems no that's not it that's prostate it's a little different sometimes we lay on our bellies before the Lord because his presence is so real I've been in that Glory ha I've been in that Glory where I didn't want to lift up my head I lay with my face my my teeth my nose my mouth buried in the carpet so to speak and I didn't even want to tilt up my head because the heavy weighted the heavy weight of his presence was so real that I didn't want to disturb it I recently heard a preacher say there'll be no dancing around the throne hogwash amen I'm going to dance I'm going to dance my way all the way to the throne and then I'll fall on my face if dancing is a part of Praise here it's certainly going to be a part of Praise there what I'm not going to do is what the charismatics talk about sometime I'm not going to March up to the throne crawl up on Daddy's and give him a high five that I'm not going to do and you ain't either and they ain't either you know people can get so comfortable but dance yeah and how do I know that won't displease the Lord because he told me to do it in his word are you still with me so praise is individual and uh well I don't want to give I don't want to skip around here let me just move on what was happening in this service that we read about here praise started the next thing you know voices begin to blend together with the trumpets and all of a sudden it was not many sounds it was not many expressions of praise it began to be one voice of worship this is how we learn the difference between praise and worship there there arose One Voice of Unity of Unison no one standing out Above the Rest everyone balancing themselves with the rest and a and a sound coming forward that was edifying and glorifying to the Lord and it was inviting the glory we are responsible to create an atmosphere for the word of God to go forth in we are responsible to create an atmosphere for God to come down and meet our needs so praise is how we enter in let us enter into his gat his courts with Thanksgiving and with praise praise is entering into his presence but worship is something different it's not necessarily uh as demonstrative it can be it's not always as visible which we'll get to a little bit later it can be sometimes someone is worshiping and you don't even know by looking at them there were they're just bowing their head and you may think that's a that person's dead there's no spirit in them at all no no no that's worship sometime definitely not praise again you don't get to choose how you praise you stand you sit you dance you you fall prostrate you speak you shout you sing Come On You clap your hands you raise your hands you play instruments with your hands where do you get this The Book of Psalms the greatest worship book praise and worship book in the Bible these are the ways and we should participate as Believers in all of those things we should all leap we should all at times when we're able dance we should all lift our hands we should all clap our hands we should all play instruments somebody said well I I really wish I could play the piano no you don't because the the proof of your of your desire is proven by your Pursuit not by your whin it's not too late for you to learn the guitar it's not too late for you to learn the piano why are you looking at me like that well I don't have time for that well you've got time for Fantasy Football you got time for what's it called Monopoly go you got time to burst your bubbles come on now you got time to do word searches some of you's got time to read Amish you know Christian fiction on now some of you's got time for Grace Livingston Hill some folks are backslid enough that they reach Stephen King and some of these other true true writers you know whatever you call them it's not edifying it's going to get quiet now just remember I was raised in a in a time in the cost when it was a sin they preached hard not to read the funny paper so I grew up not even reading the comic strips so I can preach it all day long there comes a time that we spread ourselves too thin with all kinds of other entertainments you could use a little bit of that time to learn a note come on now you ought to at least be able to do I can read I can [Music] read an't that amazing I can read I can write I can so iron my daddy's shirts or whatever I don't remember what the rest of it was but but anybody could if you wanted to if you don't want to that's all right but don't be telling people you wished you could right is it one way to praise the Lord wouldn't it be something if everybody had a had that uh there'll be gifted people there there'll be those who have anointing to do it but we ought to use our hands if we're going to clap we're going to raise them why don't we use them for playing some kind of instrument sometime wouldn't that be amazing would be wonderful if we had an orchestra we might have to put them down there to get them all in but it'd be fine with me to use our hands to praise the Lord and so I Believe In davidic Praise but there comes a time that the glory of God desires his manifest presence he wants to pour that Among Us he wants that to flow into our lives because praise doesn't change us but Glory does you come in contact with the glory of God the cavod the heavy the heavy presence of the Lord and you'll never be the same just quite the same again some things are going to happen some of the world's going to roll off of you and the desires of your heart are going to change a little bit and here's the thing that's going to change the most your root ruined once you've ever tasted you're going to have to pray for me once you have ever tasted of that she that heavy Glory presence of the Lord you are ruined you have tasted it like an animal that has tasted Blood come on and now he's a danger to society an alligator that's attacked a human is a danger a bear that's attacked a human is a danger to society because they've got the taste of blood in them you let a Believer you let a Believer have a taste of the glory presence of the Lord and he or she is ruin it could never be church as usual again that's right you're going to leave an atmosphere like this and go back and sit in a Methodist Church how could anybody make such foolish decisions with their lives to leave a holy ghost place and there many of them to go back into formal religion sir you've not tasted of what I've tasted of you've not had a drink of what I've been drinking you get a drink of that and you're ruined amen absolutely ruined nothing no liturgy sir I don't care how true the truth is they preach nothing nothing can satisfy you but being in that presence it changes everything I want to ask you what happened in this Ser praise became worship yes sir and then it says in the in verse at the end of that verse for he is good his mercy endureth forever a and that then that then that then the house was filled with a cloud even even even the house of the Lord so that the priest could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of God so really here it is you praise until the spirit of worship comes and you worship until the glory comes and then you don't rush to go home you stand in the glory if you can't stand in the glory you fall in the glory you kneel in the glory you lay down in the glory the point is you don't rush away from that presence of the Lord you'll soak it in and you linger there oh Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah so what happened here Heaven invaded Earth that's right Heaven invaded Earth this is from Sister Ruth's writings on the glory she said as air is the atmosphere of the earth did you say she I did just because someone is a woman doesn't make them dumb brother vom said a woman has every right to every spiritual gift except handling the word somebody said well isn't writing about the glory handling the word I'll leave that up to you all I know is what she wrote Chang my life now why are we here talking about this this morning because I had a visitation from the Lord on December the 22nd of 2023 and in that Vision I was told that we were going to be mountain climbers this Gregorian year of 2024 and I I I asked the question how will we do that he said first be very surefooted watch your feet be strengthened in your feet be strategic with your feet watch where you step it's important I'll make your feet like hein's feet this is what he tells us and so I asked in this visitation I asked how will we do that and I was told five things and the first of those things was that we should should keep our balance I heard brother perig Green's voice saying whatever you do keep your balance in the scriptures and he was quoting what brother brandham had said to him the second voice I heard was that of brother brandham I recognized it immediately and he said whatever you do stay in the middle of the road and thirdly the next voice I heard was that of sister Ruth Ward hefin and she said pray praise whatever you do remember praise until the spirit of worship comes worship until the glory comes then stand in the glory so this morning we've made it to the third uh word of of advice of exhortation and there are two more to go but I'll be here for at least a couple of services as air is the atmosphere of the Earth glory is the atmosphere of Heaven that makes sense to me because it's the manifested presence of God it lifts us up hear us it lifts us up above the Earthly into the very presence of God the New Testament said we are we are raised to sit together we've been told by the message that that is is a present day reality we're not waiting to sit together in Heavenly places we are made to sit together in Heavenly places when we get in that presence of the Lord it is as though we are being lifted it is as though we are being lifted into another dimension alt together if you've been there you know can I just say today if you know you know and if you don't know you don't know but if you know you know and if you know then you know the importance as often as possible to go beyond [Music] praise to come in to worship which is it's also very individual but it produces a very corporate sound when you've got more than one person in the same atmosphere pouring out like oil here's worship let let me give you praise when the spirit of the Lord is upon me I will dance like David dance that's praise worship is like oil upon your feet like wine for you to drink Lord like water from my heart I pour say I pour my love on you praise is not less than worship praise is as important as worship because nobody ever came under the spirit of worship that didn't get there by Praise amen there is an order praise first how long do you pray you praise you know three songs and again God have mercy if it was written after 1950 that's how some people are a young young man walked up to me at the wedding and he didn't know who I was I'm nobody but he didn't know who I was but he knew who another brother who was talking to me was and it was a little bit funny that he knew him and didn't know me but I didn't let it bother me the other brother said well do you know who this is and he said no I don't know him and anyway it went on but this brother began to talk about praise and worship he's a singer and of course if you're a singer it's important to you singing is important to you praise is important worship is important to you a and he began to talk a little bit about the the the influ the charismatic influence of the new worship and the new style and I said brother I'm with you if it's all about my reaction to God it's not enough but if it's about God if it's about him if it's about who he is when we praise we are emphasizing what God has done the Horse and Rider thrown into the sea but when we worship we're not emphasizing as much what God has done we're now emphasizing who God sh who God [Applause] is many people never get that far many praisers never get to worship many have not yet experienced being bathed in your own tears right because you praised beyond your manhood your manliness on you praised beyond your per I'm going to preach today if I have to Dr I'm going to preach it you praise beyond your D it you praised beyond your reputation your staunchness your religion call it what it is it's [Music] religion you can praise with religion but real worship only takes place with [Applause] relationship so if all you have is is a religious connection to God you're going be a wonderful F praiser but if you want to move beyond the realm of Praise into the realm of worship so the glory can fall down on your head and Change Your Life Worship comes out of an overflow of a relationship of intimacy with God Almighty with our savior and bridegroom King the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua see worship is not focusing on on the might of his hand or the strength of his arm worship is IS F focusing on simply who he is You're Beautiful Jesus You're Beautiful Jesus I well I'm just not comfortable calling another man beautiful then you didn't praise your way to this place because if you praised your way to this place you forgot all that stuff sir you quit struggling over how a man can be the broad of Christ and how a woman can be the Son of God you get wo I'm preaching you get all that settled in the realm of Praise so the truth is some of us haven't praised enough we ought to be looking forward to some glorious days because some of our folks have some catching up to do with their praise because if you're still thinking like that I could never tell another man he's beautiful then why don't you remember that he's not just a man he's God Almighty and there was a time in his life and Ministry that there was no Beauty in him to be found and no comeliness but I want you to know from the Mount of transfiguration when God glorified him even the marring that took place at Calvary none of that could take away from the resurrected beauty of the glorified Christ you have listened to PMA Vision right you do know what he said about eyes like fire and feet like brass and you're beautiful Jesus You're Beautiful Jesus the heavens are open and I see the Lord You're Beautiful Jesus your beautiful Jesus the heavens are open and I see the Lord if you ever catch a glimpse if you ever catch a glimpse in the message confirmation confirmation and evidence paragraph 14 remember that we mustn't never come to church to play religious I'm going to be honest with you I see people here sometime hiding behind a wiggle you think if you do that you really praising the Lord are you against that no I'm not against moving but some people aren't moving to praise they're moving to look busy it's going to be a little rough here just a few minutes I promise you it won't be long they're just moving to be a part of the crowd come on that I'm not even shaming you you want to be a part I want you to be a part so connect your heart to your wiggle let your heart be conect connected to God so that the demonstration of your body will be more than just a sway it'll be entered into the heavenlies as praise so that it can bring the the spirit of worship into your life that attracts draws and invites the glory to come because once you get in the glory you don't you don't feel the Wiggle anymore you don't feel the jump anymore you don't feel the squeal anymore come on it gets heavy on your head you ever have that shag Glory come and sit on top of your head it feels sometimes like your head is being shoved down into your neck into your shoulders the heavy weightiness of that Glory becomes so real that what you could do five minutes ago in a spirit of praise you can no longer do that's because you've gone somewhere do you hear what I'm teaching you today you've gone somewhere those of you that have been here long enough although I have new notes those of you who have been here long enough have gone through this teaching with me many years ago but even we sometime need a refresher come on people find various things to hide behind sometimes people hide behind their children and they stay constantly busy with their children not necessarily because the children have a need but because you have a need a need to hide a need to be checked out I saw the Judgment of God fall on a man one time who hid behind his little girl a presence of God fell in the room and he was hiding behind his child when he had every opportunity to participate that's why I'm never going to say anything about Nathan bringing his and brother Josh bringing his and and Tiffany bringing hers and whoever else brings their sister hope I've seen her over there both of them before and any of the rest of you whove come and you it it'd be better I know you'd like it better I've seen sister GW sister Anna Christine and and it'd be better for you if you didn't have to fool with them but you had them you brought them into the Earth hello why don't you introduce him to praise somebody said that little child was distracting me and the ow stop watching them I agree with you sometime but get your eyes off of that you're not here to people watch you're here to praise until the spirit of worship comes then worship until the glory come then [Applause] stand in the glory woo I hit 90 de with no music remember we mustn't never come to church to play religious we mustn't come to put on a religious act to go to church now I I've corrected you you know uh who move but but the reality is some people are so religious they come to church they can't ever move and somehow they feel spiritual by being stoic and may I just say especially preachers especially preachers sometimes a preacher behaves himself like it's beneath him to raise up his hands and turn his face toward God Almighty and begin to that's wrong folks that's wrong that's wrong I tell you leadership is leading in all things not just you be quiet and listen to me preach but let me show you how to to praise him let me show you how to worship him let me show you how to entertain the glory come on that's what servant leadership is all about it's not just it's not just you know buying your tank of gas it's a whole lot more than that and we need men and we're going to have them what if I told you we're going to have them because congregations that will not entertain the glory in the last days will be judged not in the end they'll be judged in the last days congregations that will not entertain the glory of the Lord the angel of God will come and write kabot over the door and that is the last plague brother brandom said that is spiritual death when he talks about spiritual death he's not talking about out there right he's talking among those who claim to know the truth you'll sit right on the Pew and drop and die if you're not careful because you want to fit into some kind of a of a mold that someone has created but there's going to come an hour I'm telling you I believe it with all my heart that God's no longer going to tolerate religion in his house and he's going to deal with those places that refuse to entertain the presence of the Lord now I don't mean to be critical or judgmental but let me tell you why men and women refuse to entertain the presence of the Lord because when he shows up he brings his love gifts with him and sin can be exposed then so if we keep the glory presence out and we keep the gifts out of the don't don't even bother with a back room because that doesn't work and it had never worked and it doesn't work come on yes sir maybe it's solve the problem at the brandham Tabernacle because it was preached for one man who was disturbing the service when brother brandham wasn't there brother brandham asked the deacons to deal with it and they could not do it and finally he come back they complain to him again he said if you can't deal with it I'll deal with it and so he gave Church order just put those gifts in a room and spiritual people meet before the service because of one man now had brother brandham been there more often perhaps he might have had the ability and the time to take that one man in a back room and put the word of Correction on him because if one man was causing the problem one man needed to be dealt with but instead it was brought to the congregation and not only adopted by the brandom Tabernacle but by hundreds of churches around the world and I wonder wonder if they know that they're doing that because of one man one gift that couldn't find its place and I'll tell you what I even know some of what the gift was saying he was uh telling brother brandom who wasn't even in the building where to go next they kept having problems with him and several others from time to time directing brother br to what city they thought he should go to next so people were literally coming from other cities I'm glad they love their City daring to stand up and say I the word of the Lord unto you is come to whever I live so that had to be dealt with now it was dealt with so extremely I didn't mess up I chose my word carefully it was dealt with so extremely that a whole generation of people have grown up around this truth that have never seen a a a real moving of the gifts of the Spirit I mean real the real the real not just exhortation in the spirit God reminding you of who he is in quoting scripture I mean real prophetic utterance yes sir we've seen that we've had periods of that we thank God for it we didn't ever intend for it to be our Focus we focus on him but when he comes he brings more than the anointing to preach oh yeah I need you to help me we must you we mustn't come to just put on a religious act my goodness I've been preaching an hour and I'm on page one we we mustn't just come to put on a religious act to go to church we must come to worship how trth in spirit and in truth it's Jesus said the time will come yes sir we must be deeply and sincerely we must really mean what we're coming here for the days are getting evil the time is evil and we want to make every minute count and especially when we're in the house of the Lord so you don't get an off Sunday you don't get to C and limit your response like how rough your week was cuz you didn't come to praise God for a good week last week you came to praise a good God the truth is he's good when you have a good week he's good when you have a bad week he's still good he's still God he deserves of Praise I've even told you all when you knock down drag out with your wife all the way to church yeah you turn to her and say honey we'll get this ironed out and repented of and made right in a little while but I'm going in there to praise the Lord and I'm not going to judge your praise I'm asking you not to judge mine I may not be worthy to praise him because I haven't yet repented of my hateful attitude toward you the love of my my life but I'm going to praise him because he's worthy come on now preacher step on your toes so the next service you come in all bound up you didn't get recognize you did something and didn't get thanked enough for it which I know happens all the time around here because I don't make enough notes and you let that affect the way you praise you you're not entering into anything come on now you're missing out don't you do that don't waste a service we want to make every minute count and especially when we're in the house of the Lord we want to praise until the spirit of worship comes worship until the glory comes then stand in the glory I think I may have another quotation but if we want to experience deep worship we need vibrant praise first if we have vibrant praise then we'll have I love that because it is really so opposite of what people think in the glory book sister Ruth talks about uh the Chicken and the Egg thing you know which came first the chicken or the egg she you said some people can never agree do do we go higher to go deeper or do we go deeper to go higher did you follow that and she said in my opinion and I want to say I 100% agree we go higher to go [Music] deeper we ascended to Wade through the depths we don't go deep so we can go high we go high so that we can go deep we're talking spiritual now in the natural we go low in humility so that we can go high in God's Authority but in the spirit we worship we praise with high praises let the high praises of God we have vibrant praise if we have vibrant praise then we'll have deep worship and we'll have the fullness of the glory of God manifested oh oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah maybe I should just share here because some of you were not listening Tuesday night and you may wonder why I'm quoting from a woman she was a missionary to the Nations I never heard her name really her her work was praise and worship she had a a unique ability raised in a in in a in a true Pentecostal Holiness home grandparents she was a direct descendant of Jonathan Edwards she had grandparents that were in the oldtime ways of Pentecost parents that were in the oldtime ways of Pentecost she never married so she didn't have any children to leave behind her brother was an amazing man her uncle was one of my favorite one of the favorite men of my whole life that I've ever met in my life and how did you even know I never met them never heard their name we certainly didn't Worship in the same circles years ago and we didn't certainly after coming to the message you know when we're just not allowed to like anybody else or have any confidence in anybody else I'm I'm surprised sometime but you know we hear people talk about they burned all their tapes and uh all the tapes they had of other preachers and any they had they thr out well look folks I want to tell you something you're ignoring the very message you say you believe cuz even brother brandom tells us you don't throw the whole pie out you need the Holy Ghost to let you know what's truth and not trueu but you spit the seat out it's not going to hurt you now if you start hanging out in that more than you do in this revealed word you're going to get out of balance and it's going to cost you something hello you see the way I feel is these churches were taking a bigger risk inviting me to come for 10 years than I was taking by accepting the invitation was I just went and did my own thing I did exactly what I felt like God was calling me to do if it bankrupt hell hair lip the devil then I knew I didn't have to ever go back again I knew many times before I finish my message that would be the last one I would be delivering so in that moment you just switch right down to low gear and give it everything you got all at one time tell it all I stood in in in conferences of 5,000 people and said if you're not baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you are Catholic you've been baptized under a Catholic Doctrine and you need to go to the river the water the bapt and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in a trinitarian conference hosted by trinitarian church now maybe I was invited there in hopes that I would say what they wanted me to say but since I didn't ask them what they wanted me to say and most of the time if I if I veered to to the Comfort Zone it would be like I told you the other day they would ask me I thought you were going to talk about the ministry of brother brandham William brandham oh oh you really want me to yes so I never heard the name Hein or Ward there was a mobile home that used to sit right here where the church is and I had an office in that mobile home because we didn't have a church building here and I needed an office on the campground and most of the time it was some a place for people to stay the other end or some preacher to stay in and then Rob Us blind that only happened twice but anyway moving right along good gravy that's right anyway hallelujah praise the Lord one day I'm in the back of that trailer in the top of the closet moving a box of books magazines and I always don't kill me don't Stone me but for years I subscribed to Charisma magazine because I enjoyed reading about what was going on in the Pentecostal charismatic World whether I wanted to turn around and preach against it or whether I wanted to dig deeper into it I liked reading and I liked having the research and information at my hands I was told many times to throw them old magazines away they were just taking up space but I didn't listen I brought them over here one day in prayer the Lord shows me a woman's face as clear as a day she reminded me of my grandmother she had her hair teased and up in a holy haird might had a little color in it but anyway and God said I want I'm going to give you a word for her and I'm going to give her a word for you I said Thank You Lord but I don't know who that woman is far as I know I've never seen her in my life sometime later don't know exactly how long not too long maybe days I don't I don't recall forgive me I go to pull that box of books magazines down off the top shelf and when I do one slides off the top Hallelujah and when it landed on the floor it opened up to a particular page and there she was in the Charisma and it was a it was an invitation to the camp meeting being held at Calvary Pentecostal church or Tabernacle in Ashland Virginia and I saw her there and I grabbed that up so quick and I looked at it and I said all right now I know her name and now I've got to find out how to get to her the Lord had never yet given me the word for her he just said I will and I'll give her one for you and if I would have been as staunch as some folks I would have said well I have the word I have the message I have the truth I don't need a word from the Lord cuz I've got it all now come on but I'm not that person I wasn't then and I'm not now if God wants to use somebody to speak to me I want him to do it and if he can't find anybody in the message to give me a word because they're preaching against it right I've heard it recently they they're calling prophecy uh uh instead of prophesying they're calling it prophal lying and there may be many who propal but that doesn't mean that all propal anybody following me now I was ready to hear whatever the Lord had so I go to my desk at the office at the church in Columbus I also had a desk there and I called one day one winter might have been about this time of year and a and a and a sister from the islands answers the phone what was her name honey Mason it just slipped my mind sometimes you will see her often comment on social media something that I write something that I post a picture of the family or something you'll see sister Mason will comment to this day because she knows for a moment in our lives God connected us for a reason and I said uh sister I'm calling for information about the camp the Winter Camp that's going on about about to start and I would like to come up and uh I believe the Lord has dealt with my heart that I need to come and I'd like to meet this sister Ruth and uh I but I I have some concerns and and I said I I'm I'm sort of sheltered and and I don't get out too much among other groups and camps and I didn't in those days little did I know that God was about to put me there and and I said I don't know how to ask this so I just spit it out she said all right brother that's what I want you to do I said do you all have any men preachers that come out of my mouth she said oh yes yes yes and she began to name the brothers off and I said well good I I I'm just not real big on women preacher but I love my granny was a woman preacher and I love I love women who dedicated their lives to the Lord but I I worry about the biblical you know I worry about the scripture on that and I just want to know oh she said you you will find a variety of you will oh she said I I uh I I I let the river flow let the river flow Hoy Spirit come move in power let the river flow let the river flow let the riv ever flow and I thought she was coming to an end of the song and then she said let that was days of long distance let the river flow let the river flow you're missing a good chance to sing it with me Holy Spirit come move in power Let the River River flow let the river flow let the riv flow I don't know how many times she sung it to me but when she came to the end of that she said brother I'm seeing a vision I'm so glad I was open to that she said I'm seeing a vision she said it's just like that little pot of pansies on the corner of your desk I thought to myself I don't have any pansies there's no windows in my office I don't have any pansies in my desk and this is a TR on my desk literally I go sitting on my the corner of my desk sister Isabelle weams had potted a little pot of pansies they were my grandfather's favorite flower I've always said they were my favorite flower and I've mentioned in visitations to other places in the spirit especially Heavenly places I've seen pansies there in in in multitudes and what looks like a little face to you in in eternity was a face and it turned every one of them turned as I walked by now you don't forget that you have an experience like that that even the flowers watch you I know some of you watching this I know I'm giving you all more fod more ammunition but I'm telling how it happened and so in the in the in the cold weather you know pans is a flower that can go all the way through the winter sister weams had potted up a little pot of pansies and she sat it by my seat and Stacy seat for a luncheon that we had had on the Sunday before she sat that little pot of pansies there for decoration and she knew that I love the flower and she had carried them up after the lunch and and and sat them there on the corner of my desk and I didn't even really realize they were there until sister Mason saw them in the spirit she you some things you can make up and fix up speculate some things you can't we didn't have no you know what what do they call it FaceTime we we had handheld phones that plugged in the wall and she said you're like that little p now every man wants to be called a pansy in the spirit when I finally got to meet her I said I want to thank you so much you really boosted my manhood by by calling me a pansy she just cackled she said you know you're like that pansy in that little pot there on the corner she said I see you all frozen over in the winter your head just bowed down but she said I know what happens when the sun comes out and if you've ever grew penies like I have you know it it's true you can see them all froze up sickles hanging down from the face of that but you let the sun come out give them a little while Hallelujah and they just raise up their little heads and turn right toward she said I see God about to do that for [Music] you he's going to throw you out and he's going to turn your face toward the Sun and I don't know what else she said but I know one thing I didn't care in that moment please don't cut the out I didn't care in that moment if everybody there was a woman I wanted to go see what that place was about so I can't go into all the story but it's big it's big what God did there were people there of every variety no Holiness that first night I got there I couldn't find any sister Ruth wasn't in the building and the leaders weren't in the building and I thought I saw people you know I thought oh my oh Lord as if I hadn't already known strange people these are some of the strangest people I've ever seen in my life there was a brother praying and he was doing like this with his hair while he prayed I thought oh Lord help us I actually went to a morning service afternoon service and wouldn't take my wife I said you stay here at the hotel and rest I have no idea what I'm going to get into over there you stay here she said all right I decided to let her go with me that night and that's when the man was doing like that we sat in the back and all this is the truth before God they were talking rudest bunch of folks like some of you all after a service when you do all your talking in here instead of out there see how quiet it gets when you resemble the remark do you see how quiet you get that's a pastor's uh life they were talking I mean talking loud before the service started loud going around oh I hadn't seen you in so long and I thought how could how could anybody make sacred the atmosphere of this room with these people carrying on like Hicks off the farmyard I mean I am in the seat of the scornful and all of a sudden God be my witness AC hundreds of people and across that Auditorium there come a shift right over the building I must have not been the only one who felt it because everybody in the room went Silent not a person talking and two sisters walked in the back door I didn't know either one of them at the time they looked theart they had their hair up on their heads they were dressed in sleeves and long clothes and fur coats it was cold they looked like something out of a book I'd never seen them before they looked like they had just stepped out of some history book or something and they come walking down the Isis and I'm telling you woo the presence of God was so real it was hanging on them like [Music] perfume they didn't greet anybody but my wife and I they turned to us and they greeted us both and one of those sisters kissed me on my cheek and I melted they were both in their 70s and all I could look up and see was my gray-haired granny kissing me on the cheek and I sobbed oh I know there'll be somebody say something about that but it it melted all the anxiety and all the fish out of water feeling that I'd been dealing with and they walked right on down greeted us both and walked right down The Isle and sat on the front row on the same side of the building that we were in and from that moment until the service started there was a presence in that room that was just profound profound in a few minutes there were some leadership begin to come in and and they were Holiness and although there were many people there who were not these the leadership brother Jackson and several of the others Darlene and so many of the others came in and played the music Michelle Acres was there and she played the music and there was such a presence and in the middle of worship sister Ruth and that whole big crowd of people sister Ruth came to the to the pull pit and she looked back in our Direction in the middle of worship in fact just to be honest she took little brother Jackson who was leading the worship you know he was up there singing a song or whatever she just took her hand ped him on the side and just moved him out of the way and she stepped up and she said little brother I'm not little maybe next to her I was a little bit but I want to talk to you she said I see you in the river remember let the river flow but she said you've been in a basket like Moses and God has protected you for many years but he is about to take you out of that basket and plunge you into the depths of the Spirit River and you're going to know him in ways you have never known him before and experience him in ways you have never experienced him before and I did and the history rolls on and I ended up preaching there at the summer camp and having many conversations on the phone and and I was able to give sister Ruth the word the word for her was set your Affairs in order he's coming to take you home her word was the one I just mentioned and several others that she gave me over the course of times as as often as I could get to where those meetings were going I wanted to go I didn't forsake the message I didn't quit believing the prophet I didn't quit preaching the message I just experienced a refreshing that brought a refreshing to this church body and plunged us into years of Revival and they were coming off the streets brother Shaw to experience what God was doing in the house now I know there's es and flows and seasons of things but I believe that in all of that experience two years of Fellowship until the Lord took her and when I heard the news that she had passed away I was crushed I cried like a baby I was like losing my grandmother all again I had bought her a dress for Mother's Day because I couldn't do that for my granny anymore so I sent her a check and said please buy a dress for Mother's Day Stacy and I want to bless you and it was the dress that she was buried in but I didn't know that I didn't know what we were doing when I went there they had 24hour testimony service for three days before her burial people came from all over the world and they stood under the t under the Tabernacle and testified of of what they saw in those meetings all over the world God sent her to Hal salasi the Emperor of Ethiopia twice to give him a word of the Lord I don't understand all of that but what I do understand is you can do a lot for God you can do God a service and not be in the center of his will and you know what my reaction to that is if she could be used of God out of his will like that come on what is my excuse come on sir yes sir if I carry anything out of those years and there were many connections remember it was Sister Nancy who represented her Ministry in Israel that opened their door for us in 2002 and she ended up stepping down out of the ministry flying from Jerusalem here to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and open the doors for us to go and baptize hundreds of people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ while while spending time in Israel so I could go on and on and on about the connections but but I'm going to say like brother green did he said the most important advice brother brother brandom ever gave me was keep your balance in the scripture I'm going to say the most valuable thing that I think we could carry away from our association for those two years of time is praise until the spirit of worship comes and then worship until the glory comes and then stand in the glory I want you to look at Psalm It's 121 I want you to look at Psalm 24 verse 1-10 the Earth is the Lord's did I leave anything out honey that I should have put in that I could say that I never saw the highes as excited as they were when God sent me there that weekend and they didn't know why they couldn't figure out why they were so excited but they were so excited they called me three times while I was there I wouldn't scream cuz I was busy but they were so excited they wanted to know everything that happened they give me $100 to go several people did and they wanted to know everything that was happening and come to find out her Hebrew teacher was their Hebrew teacher and boy that just sent them over the moon it connected us to Israel a place that they love so dearly and it spent some time living there in the land anyway it goes on the earth is the Lord's and the I hope I didn't lose you I'm not quite done yet the Earth is the Lords and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein for he ha founded it upon the Seas and established it upon the floods who shall Ascend into the hill of the Lord or who shall stand in his holy place he that hath Clean Hands and a pure heart who have not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully he shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from the god of his salvation oh that's beautiful this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face oh ja Jacob Sila pause and think on these things it immediately goes in to lift up your heads oh ye gates you and be ye lift up ye Everlasting doors you and the king of glory shall come in you are the gate you are the arabah in Hebrew the SLO gate the flood gate you are the gate by which Heaven invades the Earth the presence of God enters the Earth through you as a holy ghost believer and you prepare to to be a gate by Praise by coming into a place of worship so that that manifested Glory can show up in your life are you too tired to stay with me if you are I'll just stop I won't be a offended I'll just stop and continue later but if I continue I need to know you're there and the king of glory not until the heads are lifted up oh ye gates and everlasting doors are lifted up and opened and then the king of glory shall come in woo I feel nearly drunk who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the Lord Mighty in battle Church don't you know he's bigger than your battle don't you know he's bigger than your storm don't you know he's bigger than the trial you're in right now now he's bigger than your question he's bigger than your confusion he's bigger than where you are right now at this moment in your life yes the king of glory shall come in let's go on is that it no lift up your heads oh ye gates even lift them up your Everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory Sila to praise the definition of praise is to speak well of maybe you have a a graphic there to speak well of to compliment to command to applaud to extol I want you to understand and I I'm going to close in a moment on page three I'm not quite on page three heading there we weren't sure if charity would be able to be here today she's been fighting something and Mariah ask on the way and she doesn't like putting it in it's a lot of work and and and she's afraid she's going to make a mistake and we we didn't think maybe chy would be here so Mariah asked on the way she said daddy do you have a lot of notes today I said only 14 pages for you 23 Pages for me but only 14 for you she said oh we know praise as a Prelude to a good service but I want you to know that that praise is a powerful instrument for Harvest we don't just praise to get the right feeling in the room sometimes we praise as preparation for harvesting what has been sown many times we long to hear his voice but in the song of songs the bridegroom says to the bride I want to see your face I want to hear your voice Face First Voice next I don't want to just hear I want to seek your face I want to see your face then I want to hear your voice God has given us a voice to be lifted up in praise to him if we have nothing else to offer him we have a voice there's a liberty that comes from putting your praise into audible words God wants to hear your voice speak your praise God wants to hear your voice sing your praise it releases the river of God to flow out of you as you open your mouth and begin to declare the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living declaring the Miracles of the Lord declaring the healing of the Lord declaring the victory of the Lord declaring the newness of the Lord using your voice as a trumpet sounding forth the blessings of the Lord the more you declare His blessings the more you'll have to declare the more you speak about his goodness the more you'll have to speak about his goodness Psalm 891 I will sing of the mercies of the Lord forever my Not My Thoughts come on with my mouth will I make known Thy Faithfulness help me to all generations amen there's a teaching floating around that praise is for the immature but intercession is for those that are spiritual you can read that in the glory book praise is for the immature but intercession is for those that are spiritual that couldn't be anything farther from the truth in Revelation one of the great praise books of the Bible in reality the praise and worship book of heaven we read this in re 195 and 6 and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye his servants and ye that fear Him both small and great and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many Waters and as the voice of many thundering saying hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth amen notice where the voice is coming from notice what the voice is saying it's almost a paradox when you hear anyone saying that praise is shallow you know that they need a deeper revelation of what praise really is you hear somebody calling praise part of the shook you know they don't understand what they claim to Believe come on you hear them saying that true Pentecost is part of the shook you'll know they don't understand what they've listened to right the only part of the shuck that Pentecost has anything to do with is the domination of Pentecost when brother brandom is talking about the truth of the church ages he tells us you you leave behind the fanaticism of the age before and you bring the truth over as each of the messengers did that they brought the truth of the prior age over into the next age so for them to tell you then by isolated Church age Book quote that what what work then won't work now right the F of that the Folly of that the Flesh of that the denominational structure and mindset of that will not work over here but we bring the truth of every age otherwise it's not a restoration of a brid tree if it's restoration of a brid Tre you bring the truth of every age and you start building the tree back Luther justification Wesley sanctification and notice brother Ram did not play a role in this because he simply said and Pentecost which preceded his ministry yes it was justification sanctification and baptism of the Holy Ghost and for you to tell me that nobody had the Holy Ghost until his ministry began you'd be out of the word and out of History that wasn't his role we have to be very careful in the balance because we can't have an eighth messenger and under the seventh age Pentecost was restored so we got to be real careful how we slant that or we may slant him right out of the word we might slant the message right out of its significance if we don't let it find its balance in the scripture the greatest Instrument of Praise that God has given you as your voice learn to lift it up to him we have discovered that not only did praise Delight Our God as he desired more of it but that he also liked it louder because he tells us to lift up Lift Up Lift Up Lift Up Lift up somebody said well I think he's just talking about where you send your praise then what did he mean when he said praise him with a loud voice he tells us to praise with the voice of Thanksgiving Psalm 267 write this down it's not on a slide he tells us to praise with the voice of Thanksgiving Psalm 267 he tells us to praise with the voice of Triumph Psalm 471 he tells us to praise with the voice of a Psalm Psalm 985 and he tells us to praise with the voice of rejoicing Psalm 1815 he keeps telling us over and over again how important the voice is got a little more to get in here the voice that John heard was the voice of a great multitude the voice as of many Waters and the voice of many mighty thunderings Our Praise Rises until it thunders like Niagara or Livingston Falls what was coming out of the throne the voice of a great multitude the voice as of many Waters the voice of Mighty thunderings is that right is that what it says our praise Rises until it thunders like Niagara or Livingston Falls so great are the rushing sounds of the joining together of voice to voice it rises until it reaches a level of Mighty thunderings going forth in praise and adoration to The God Who has delivered us now watch this very close and I'm done Hosea chapter 2 verse 19-23 let's go there and I will betro thee unto me forever yay I will betro thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in loving kindness and in mercies are you following me I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness and thou shalt know the Lord I assure thee you I assure assure you this is not by information that you will know the Lord this is by intimacy and Revelation you don't know the Lord by reading about him only you know the Lord by experiencing him you will come to know the Lord by encountering him you will come to know the Lord by meeting him not just by reading about him is that right let's go on verse 21 and it shall come to pass in that day I will hear sayeth the Lord I will hear I will hear the heavens and they shall hear the Earth God said I'm going to hear the heavens and the heavens are going to hear the Earth anybody see that and the Earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil do you know what these are these are symbols of Revival and blessing and bounty and abundance somebody shout amen amen I will hear we got to find this carefully we got to look at this carefully and it shall come to pass in that day I will hear sayith the Lord I will hear the heavens and they shall hear the Earth the heaven shall hear the Earth and the Earth shall hear the corn the Earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and they shall hear JZ Israel will say it in English yes thr and I will sow and I will sow her unto me listen in the earth I will sow her yesel jezrael I will s her unto me in the earth and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained Mercy whoop and I will say to them which were not my people Thou Art my people and they shall say what thou now I think I gave you the definition of of of jezrael it means god SWS in in verse 22 it says and the Earth shall hear the corn and the wine and the oil and they shall hear jesrael and I will sow God SWS is the meaning of jesrael God SWS the Lord who sits in heaven hears that which we sow to the heavens follow this he said I will hear the heavens and the heavens will hear the Earth in response because we have sown our praise heavenward God SWS he SWS back to the Earth powerful you seed to the heavens he seeds back to the Earth powerful in response because we have sowed heavenward God SWS to the Earth he is not only the Harvester he is also the swer we have never had a problem recognizing God as a harvester he is the chief Harvester of the field we know that what we don't know is that he's also the chief swer we thought we had done all the sewing ourselves no no he's the chief swer when I stand and begin to praise him I am sewing heavenward that's why you know praise the Lord anyhow is not going to do it it's not going to be enough half praise half-hearted praise a little wiggle but nothing much else you know this is not enough this is sincere connectedness in relationship and you begin to speak your praise It Goes Forth out of this atmosphere like seed to the heaven and Heavens hear your seed Heaven receives your praise Heaven hears what you have to say and God in response to that SWS to the Earth and what does he s to the Earth wi the stimulation of Revelation oil yes Holy Ghost anointing yes come on and corn bread for the S are food food and sustenance for the believer bav corn wine and oil and without measure we can thank God for that can't we we thought we had done all the sewing no he's a sewer a and and as I am sewing heavenward in return the Earth is receiving the corn the wine and the oil which are symbols of Revival and abundance and blessing and benefit you may affect not only your community by sewing Praise You may not only affect the atmosphere of this room or this nation but by sewing praise you have the potential of affecting other regions of the world because your job is just to sew to the heaven it's up to heaven to decide where to send it back may God give you such a heartfelt praise and so many seed to sew to the heavens that you shift the atmospheres of other nations because he said I will give you the Nations as your inheritance it's not just praying for Nations but it's praising for Nations you may affect not only your community by sewing praise you can stand in one place and minister to the Lord and refect reflect outpourings effect outpourings to the ends of the Earth so I'm encouraging you to be faithful to sew to the heavens I'm going to tell you one more story in close this is from the glory book which is a life-changing little book nearly 50 I think in the glory book it's just 30s something but nearly 50 young people heard the call of the Lord in the early 70s to leave their Pentecostal Holiness Church in Richmond Virginia and I've been I've been to the to the mother Church of this camp meeting old building I'm telling you it's like stepping back in history sits right in downtown Richmond Virginia not too far from Monument Avenue there in fact I sung on a radio broadcast that was broadcast out of that church Mr Ruth said you you preach up a storm let's see if you can sing there was no time to say no it was on the radio so I grabbed the mic and started singing thank God they could follow me in a prayer meeting one night God began to lay it on the young people's heart that he was going to send them to Jerusalem to pray for the Nations and it ended up being nearly 50 who bought their tickets and cut their ties to home and caught planes I think it might have been 72 but I'm not 100% sure and they landed in Israel to find a place to stay God opened doors and they found places to stay one night they were having a prayer meeting they had prayer meetings day and night it's all they had to do they were called there to pray from Jerusalem they affected the nations of the world I have a book about that thick of testimonies that come out of the day of the years of those young people praying and God teaching them beautiful story you you know might not be interested but I was one day Catholic priests from the church of St Peter of galanto which sits right on top of Mount Zion the Mount Zion it was built over the ruins of the high priest Caiaphas his house is that also the same church where the yes where the pit where the prison pit that Jesus was kept in the night of his betrayal it's there you can go stand in the rock pit beneath that church my family's been there the Catholic priests began to hear about the prayer meetings that these Protestant young people were having over in East Jerusalem and they invited them they called them Glory sisters because there were more women than there was men and they had buns and long dresses and so they they caused quite a stir in Jerusalem because it was clear they weren't Jewish their hair was their hair was not covered or a wig as the Jews religious Jews like to do as long as it's covered either by a wig or by a scarf and these were beautiful young people who made their way through the streets of Jerusalem praying and and walking in prayer prayer walks and whatever else and the Catholic priest who oversaw the Church of St Peter of galac which is an amazing church and that that is in in it's Latin but in English it it basically means of the of the crowing of the rooster because it commemorates the place where the rooster told on Peter you know so there's a rooster on the on the top of the Spire of the church is a rooster up there reminding everybody be sure your sins will find you out the rooster will tell on you you know if you you preachers can't eat enough Fried Chicken to silence the roosters so this C Catholic Church said we don't use the church for so many hours of the day it's yours you come in and Worship the Lord and pray on Mount Zion they were scared to do it but they realized that only God could open a door there was nothing ecumenical in their agenda they they were actually terrified to do it but found out it must be the Lord and so they went but they said to the fathers fathers we need to tell you that there's a problem maybe and that is we dance when we pray in praise and they said what do you mean they said we mean what we say we dance and we don't know if you allow dancing in the none of us have been to a Catholic church and we don't know if you allow dancing and they said for the hours that you have the church you can do whatever it is you want to do including dance and before those years they were their years they met for years they didn't know how long it would last they thought maybe a few weeks it actually lasted many years that they had these daily prayer meetings in the Church of St Peter of galanto and people came Jews came and Catholics came and Protestants came from all over the world eventually to watch the dancing virgins on Zion that's what they called them because many of the prayer group were young single women who had dedicated their lives to just praying and praising in Jerusalem to affect the nations of the world it's big folks it's a big sacrifice and God so used it and so blessed but here come a brother from America and he thought this was a little waste of time and he stood up in the meeting and he said what you need to be doing is handing out tracks the way to reach Israel and the Nations is by handing out tracks sister Ruth said I could see the people getting excited and I knew in my mind that the next morning they were all going to be lined up outside the door waiting to get their tracks to go into Jerusalem and hand out tracks which would have eventually had us kicked out of the land because to proelite a Jew is against the law so if you actively reach out to try to win a Jew to to Christianity you're you're you're breaking the law of of the nation and can be persecuted and sister Ruth said I did not want to offend that brother neither did I want to squelch the enthusiasm and Zeal of the worshippers they've been so so faithful but I knew that we were not about to start marching through the streets of Jerusalem handing out paper tracks to whoever God didn't send us here to hand out tracks he sent us here to pray and praise and now to dance on Mount Zion and so she said I'm reading directly she said that night I prayed Lord give me your answer for them now remember that she was leading this prayer group and was qualified to do so because as a young girl she got on a boat and gave her life to China some of you met Gwen Shaw who was also a missionary to the world and that was the first time she ever met gwy sister Gwyn was in Hong Kong gave up everything why did God use them so because they gave up everything she gave up the love of her life because she wanted to be where God wanted her to be and she couldn't expect anybody to follow that so so she was qualified to lead this prayer meeting and she said Lord give me your answer for them and in the middle of the night the Lord spoke to me and said and this is powerful you seow to the heavens right out of the scripture you sow to the heavens and I will sow to the Earth that was the way our ministry of praise on Mount Zion was born not giving out the tracks you so to the heaven and also to the Earth and God be to pour out the Holy Ghost in prayer meetings all over the land of Israel and many of the Messianic leaders of that Nation today are the young people that were in those different prayer meetings in different places across Israel who received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and now they lead the Messianic Church the Jewish believers who are now Christian Believers in the land of Israel and they would get testimonies back as they as they worshiped and prayed and praised in Jerusalem they would get testimonies back and one of the churches that had an outpouring was down in Gaza the very place is under such turmoil right now it was Jewish held then and there was a group of little Jewish young people that had come to know Messiah and they were praying for an outpouring of God they were praying there on Zion these young people from Calvary Tabernacle were Calvary Pentecostal Tabernacle were and the word of the Lord spoke out of one of them and said while you're worshiping me tonight in Jerusalem I'm pouring out my spirit in Gaza few days later they began to make their way to Jerusalem and they began to give testimony to them find them and give testimony to them we're the beneficiaries we were meeting trying to know more of the Lord and he filled us with the Holy Ghost at the very same time that you all were praying and praising and dancing and worshiping me praise

allowed us to be that worshiping generation Lord you have raised us up at the end time as worshippers Lord you are not seeking worship you are seeking worshippers you are after us you're looking for us so Lord we just ask right now that you will teach us how to move from praise into worship to receive the glory presence of God that changes us we are changed not from song to song but we are changed from glory to glory as we behold your face Lord may we see ourselves in your economy may we see ourselves as one of those who have been preserved to Worship in the last days my God help us if you're here this afternoon and you've got a special need in your life at this time would you just raise up your hand and let somebody see you if you see there is Sister Rhonda and there there are several around Gia and Tiffany and sister Claudia and several others I couldn't see everybody sister shashana perhaps would you would you just slip to someone hold it up again if you are asking for prayer hold it up again if you're asking for prayer just slip to someone doesn't matter if someone has a big crowd slip to someone who had a need right now and it shouldn't be too hard shouldn't be too hard to get a need met in an atmosphere like this we just let our faith go Lord right now we just turn our faith loose you see every need that is represented maybe there were hands going up in people's homes you saw every hand not just the ones in this room and you know exactly what the need is and you're not only aware of the need but you have the supply you already have the benefit you have the answer if healing is needed you've already paid the price for healing if direction is needed you're the god of leadership if anxiety is an issue as as brother Hulk mentioned last Sunday and then it kind of went in a different direction but but I know there were people in this room last Sunday that deal with anxiety and were dealing with it even in that moment and I'm asking you right now to touch those even if they didn't raise their hand for a need this morning but they were here last Sunday under that burden I pray right now that by the power of the Holy Spirit you will pour peace and confidence and even the joy of the Holy Ghost into that life life to deal may they worship more praise more and worship more and come into the glory more often because that's the best thing I know as a remedy to deal with anxiety or fear or nervousness it's to focus not on how you're feeling or what you're experiencing but to focus on the goodness of God in a moment like that is the most effective thing we can do remind us by the Holy Spirit remind us in that hour to go back and do that so Lord every person who's being ministered to right now it's a little quiet in here but I'm hoping that faith is operating I'm hoping that faith is operating right now and and we're believing God yeah we're believing God to move in every one of these needs right nowall yes let the worshippers sons

go I want to say to those who are streaming the service and who are givers here you should be watching this week for your uh contribution statement to come by email and if we don't have your email address would you reach out you can send it to nhrm that's New Hope Revival ministries just the initials nrm revival. org or whatever way you communicate with us there are a few that we don't have email addresses for when you were registering in your giving you perhaps didn't provide a a mailing address or an email address and we want to be faithful stewards we want to do things right and we want to provide you whether you use it or not it's up to you if you have a conviction against using it well don't you dare put that on but I put it on mine and I'm thankful that I can because they are fighting very hard I heard again this week that there is a lot of fighting going on to to fix it so that even people who itemize their deductions will not be allowed to use their contributions a charitable contributions on there and if you give enough it is a tremendous offset for your earned income a tremendous offset and if you don't know that if you've got a software if some of you use a software play with it and put in different amounts for the giving and then it will calculate what you owe and you will find out that it makes a tremendous difference in your owed taxes by giving and those of us who give way more than 10% of our income some some give up to 30% of their income then you really are offset and if you should reach the max there are certain allowances to roll some of your charitable giving over uh into the next year this is not a tax seminar brother Billy would be better qualified to do that than I would but every year it asks me when I go to fix mine if I have uh have something that was left over and not taken and not used I don't know how long that last either but I'm thankful I want you to know that you have been so faithful in your giving and again let me make this announcement and then we're going to leave the streamers if you have given and we don't have or you're not sure whether or not we have your email address if you'll email it to us nhrm revival. org that would be the best way to get it to us and then we will send this week the emailed receipts will will go out God bless you thank you for worshiping with us today I don't see any [Music] reason
