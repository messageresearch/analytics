[0:00] the Bible is so clear you'd be surprised
[0:02] how many times the word jealousy appears
[0:04] how many times the word envy appears and
[0:07] it almost always appears in the context
[0:10] of Christian Life is't that
[0:14] crazy the Bible has little to say about
[0:16] Sinners being
[0:20] envious or or ungodly men being
[0:24] jealous the Bible mainly talks about
[0:27] Believers Christians spirit filled
[0:31] folk dealing with
[0:34] Envy I want what you got and we learned
[0:37] that this was something that was formed
[0:40] in the heart of Lucifer and the next
[0:43] thing you know he said I'm going to put
[0:44] my Throne up there above God's Throne
[0:47] come on that selfish ambition is what
[0:50] led him to that great civil war that
[0:53] took place in the Realms of the spirit
[0:55] where he was able to persuade a great
[0:58] portion of the angels to follow him
[1:00] instead of the reality of their creator
[1:03] he's still doing that today he's still
[1:05] filling people with
[1:08] conceit he's making egomaniacs out of
[1:11] people he's plaguing even the body of
[1:14] Christ with narcissistic behavior where
[1:17] people think the whole church should
[1:19] revolve around them or the whole family
[1:22] should revolve around them even the
[1:24] whole
[1:26] world should revolve around them and all
[1:28] of it goes back to Satan's ambition no
[1:31] one wants to live their life tiptoeing
[1:34] around fragile envious jealous
[1:40] people why don't we teach our children
[1:43] that for instance every family just
[1:46] doesn't have the same thing in
[1:48] life it just doesn't happen that way but
[1:51] it's not good to be envious or jealous
[1:54] it's good to be thankful to be grateful
[1:57] to be blessed by what God has given us
[2:00] but the reality is that many times God
[2:03] will give you what he
[2:06] can trust you with so if we work on our
[2:12] character then God can often trust us
[2:16] with
[2:17] more I will keep him in perfect peace
[2:22] whose mind whose heart is stayed is
[2:28] fixed on me God said one of the benefits
[2:33] of keeping your mind on me is I'll help
[2:36] you to have
[2:37] calmness I'll help you to have wholeness
[2:40] I'll I'll help you to to live in a place
[2:43] of of Peace instead of worry and
[2:49] anxiety folks we need
[2:52] that let God do the work let him exalt
[2:57] let him lift up in the modern Church
[3:00] everybody has to have a
[3:02] title they put it on their business card
[3:06] Apostle so and so Prophet so and
[3:09] so uh intercessor so and so you you you
[3:14] don't have to have a
[3:15] title just yield to
[3:19] God let God have his way in your life
[3:22] and if you're to be promoted guess
[3:25] what he knows how to promote us
