honor to the word of God as we read it this evening and we are here to hear the word of the lord we don't need just a sermon or uh just a message we we need to hear hear from the Lord we need a word from the Lord and so I'm going back tonight to where we were last Sunday and Tuesday night and do my best not to spend too much time on review because I want us to go somewhere else in just a bit but let's refresh our memories the Lord is talking to us as a church and as a people as end time Believers as sons and daughters of God that we should make sure that we are returning in this hour to our first love and if we are getting adjusted to the world then no wonder our love for him is waxing cold in Matthew chap 24: 10-2 the Lord Jesus is talking to us and he said and then shall many be offended and shall betray one one another and shall hate one another is there any dispute that this describes quite well the hour that we're living in right now has it also been true of other ages yes I'm sure it has but never any more true than it is in the hour that we live in right now everybody is wearing their feelings on their sleeve everybody is getting a offended and betraying one another and even hatred is at an alltime high in our nation so many words are spoken to divide us and to break us apart instead of pulling us together as a nation verse 11 and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive deceive many and verse 12 and because iniquity shall abound down the love of many shall wax cold so many shall be deceived and many shall find that their love has become Frozen love in Revelation Chapter 2 and verse four Jesus has just spent the four first four verses of chapter 2 um commending the first three verses commending the Church of Ephesus how they despise evil and love truth and have labored and not fainted in the work of the Lord but in verse four he said nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy first love the Amplified version says but I have this one charged to make against you that you have left abandoned the love that you had at first you have deserted me your first love how many of you find that to be quite serious in 2 Corinthians 2:11 I know you're standing it says lest Satan should get an at Advantage let me hear you say advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices we could almost be called experts because we have been dealing with the devil and his devices all of our Christian Life we've learned a thing or two how many of you have been around the mountain a time or two and you know how slimy he is you recognize how slick he is but thanks be to God for the word that gives us an advantage over him for we are not ignorant of the way he works and then tonight our text will be found in Exodus 34: 5-7 and the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him him there and proclaimed the name of the Lord now don't be confused there's just one Lord here but he has a name and who better to reveal his name than himself so let's see if we've got this right so far the Lord himself descended on Mount sini and he stood in the cloud with the prophet there and proclaimed out loud he enunciated out loud the sacred name of the Lord think of it it's a name believed by the Jewish people to be so holy and so sacred that it is to them an unpronouncable name it is a name with with four letters and no consonants to tie no vowels to tie the cons together and so it would read if we were to read it we would read the names of the letters yod he VAV he and it is referred to as the tetron and uh we sometimes say Yahweh the English Bible says Jehovah but there is no J in the Hebrew language so we know that this is a transliteration ation doesn't matter to us tonight we will know if we need to know we can know he'll let us know is that right so this is uh they have chosen to use the word Lord which is often pronounced adoni but this is not the Hebrew word adoni every time you see the word Lord appear in these verses it is the yod V the sacred name of the Lord so he descended in a cloud he stood with his Prophet there and he pronounced he announced or proclaimed the name of God that's a powerful visitation and the Lord then passed by him or before him and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth would you mind to let us repeat tonight uh in English what was spoken that day in the mountain would you read it with me would you Proclaim it with me would you send some demons on the Run by declaring the sacredness of God the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and Truth can we do it again the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious longsuffering and abundant in goodness and Truth can you say amen amen now in verse seven before we're seated he said keeping Mercy for thousands amen notice he didn't say in this visitation an innumerable number an uncountable number he reduced it and he said Mercy for thousands forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin let's do that again forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin and that will by no means clear the guilty that's the kind of God he is he's quick to forgive but he does not forget unrighteousness amen visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and upon the children children children's children unto the third and to the fourth generation think of it son grandson great grandson great great grandson iniquity can travel three to four generations in a family until it stopped that's the word I'm not making that up this iniquity can run from fathers to children children to grandchildren grandchildren to great grandchildren great grandchildren to great great grandchildren until somebody says the blood of Jesus Christ cancels this iniquity we repent of this iniquity and we send it back to where it has come from we put our hands on our children our grandchildren great grandchildren and we say you Spirit of addiction you cannot have my children because the blood of Jesus has redeemed my family [Applause] lying it's Authority that is found in him may God help us tonight father we are humbled by your presence we were climbing tonight in Realms of spirit when we were singing these wonderful songs of praise and worship the the particles of the air were charged with the glory presence of God we know that not because we had a feeling we know it by Revelation that when We Gather in your name your glory presence is with us it's the promise of your word we expect that every time we come there won't be a regular service but there will be an outstanding and extraordinary above and beyond blessing for each who comes with faith to believe that you are the same yesterday today and forever we've come tonight not to hear from a man we have come to hear from you we have prepared our hearts we have climed climb the Holy Hill of God with praise and worship while we were climbing we have asked that our hands be cleansed and our heart be made new we stand in your presence now with Clean Hands and with a pure heart and we are ready to hear the word of the Lord may it come in whatever delivery you would choose and may we have ears and hearts to receive it strengthen the voice and we will give you praise and honor and glory for it's in the name that is above every name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua the Messiah that we pray and the Saints said amen you may be seated may God grant you Grace to to give your undivided attention tonight I I'm going to bring an important subject I yes every subject from this word is an important subject but tonight there's something in this that couldn't be uh preserved it couldn't be held for another time the urgency of the Lord said tonight tonight is the night you you've got to get this spoken tonight and so I don't want to be early I don't want to be ahead of God I don't want to be late dragging behind him how many of you want to walk in step with the revealed word of the hour we want to stay right up in the seasons of the Lord some people don't understand the es and flows of the spirit there are times that the spirit draws back and there are times that the spirit of God flows over us as we were singing tonight didn't you like that song aren't you glad you're not called to be a grave t tender I'm glad I'm not called to dig somebody else's grave my great-grandfather was a real Grave Digger and he did it with a shovel and not with a back hole I'm glad that God didn't call me to dig Graves he didn't call me to tend the graveyards I'm glad that he called me to carry the voice of Resurrection he called you to carry the voice of the Resurrection we're here to call the dead to life we're here to call Bone back to his bone God can take that bleached valley of dry bones and raise up a mighty and exceeding Army of sons of God in this hour and we're part of the number we're part of that number I'm sure of it I don't need you to confirm it because I'm sure of it we're not novices we didn't get our faith on the internet come on we didn't run everything through Google come on because I want you to know that Spirit can really get you twisted anybody with me why you can find every flavor every version and if you're a person that believes everything you read if you don't have the Holy Ghost and you believe everything you read the enemy will be able to talk you out of your faith but I want you to know he better try a new trick for some of us tonight because we have no intention of giving up or giving in this is the winning hour this is the late hour but it's a winning hour sister uh was singing the song the lord gave her uh this is my time I can say Amen this is bride time this isn't time to go back to the systems of the church this isn't the time to bow to the denominational spirits of the Antichrist this is a the hour and the time to stand on the word and here's where we won't be able to fudge anymore you won't be able to grab a hold of the coattail of somebody else's Revelation and stand against the Ws of the devil you'll have to be alone with God until he opens up the heaven and releases Revelation to your life and then when you hear Revelation from the spirit based on the absolute word of God that Revelation becomes a part of your DNA it's a rewriting that takes place in the very DNA and RNA of your body and the devil can talk you out of church rules the devil can talk you out of having picking someone else's conviction but he'll never talk you out of what the Holy Ghost has revealed to you by the word because it has become a part of you you have become a part of it every cell in my body responds to thus sayith the Lord I was built that way you were built that way we respond to the word of the Lord when it comes not only on a faith level but on a cellular level the cells in my body move when I speak when you speak the word of the Lord over your own life they respond science has proven that they hear come on somebody said how do cells hear and how do they have memory if they don't have ears and they don't have a brain I want you to know God made them in unbelievable unfathomable ways did you know it's possible to have for instance breast cancer in other parts of your body unrelated to the reproductive system or or or to the to the woman's system you can find cells of breast cancer or cells of lung cancer or cells of other kinds of cancer it they can be found in other organs of the body and for years science couldn't understand how those cells traveled but they began to understand what the Bible said we are fearfully and wondrously crafted Hallelujah not just by a Divine intelligence but by the one true Living God and he made our body to be able to face and deal with the things that's happening to it on the level of trauma and so other parts of your body start trying to fight come on we are blessed we have an army that lives within us to help fight off what the enemy wants to throw on our lives there's so much that we could say here but I I can't uh I I can't use that tonight I have to move on in Exodus 34 that we just read vers 5 through 7 we hear of this visitation that Moses had of the of the almighty God the creator of Heaven and Earth he came down in a cloud he stood with his prophet and he declared his own name over Moses I want you to know the prophet of God was changed in that moment there was a there was a transformation that took place in Moses because now the unknown God the invisible God The God Who has no name and no form and no image now has come down and revealed himself to Moses and and I want you to know his Spirit responded and his soul mind will and emotions responded to this Mighty coming down of God and the power of that name that was spoken over Moses it shifted him in a spiritual manner but it also shifted him in a physical manner the cells of his body we now know by science they adjusted to this new reality he's no longer an invisible God my Creator is a God who can come down if I need him to come down and he can Reve his name if I need to know his name and that makes me think that he must know my name because he found me here on this Mountaintop do you understand that this yod V is is the Revelation that God longs to have real Fellowship he longs to have real relationship with Mankind in Hebrew when the when the word Elohim appears we know Elohim as the Creator we know him as the one who dwelt alone with his thoughts we know him as the beginning and the originator of everything that we know and so when when the Jews used the Hebrew to refer to the god of the universe or to the god of creation they would almost all always write the name Elohim because that is how they relate to God as Creator and as the originator of Heaven and Earth but but they believe and I do as well that when God came down to Moses and declared his personal name over Moses that Moses received a revelation in that very moment that God is not just the Creator A Million Miles Away somewhere in the far expanses of the universe but that same God not a different God not a different God the same God who revealed himself as Creator to Moses so that he could write the first five books of the Bible through a scribe that same God now came down to his prophet and revealed himself as a God who l longs to have fellowship with his creation I want you to know that's the kind of God you serve I want you to know that Christianity light out there liit te Christianity light it will never be able to convince the masses that God is looking for a personal and individual relationship with them it is only when God becomes personal to you it is only when the Holy Spirit comes over your life and God makes himself known to you and makes himself real to you that you recognize in that moment he doesn't want me just to crawl around and serve him he longs to have Fellowship relationship with me are you with me this evening you serve a God who longs to spend time with you not just corporately in a setting like this but also individually he wants to come he wants to come to you in the yard he wants to come to you in the house he wants to come to you in the vehicle he wants to come to you in the church yard not just in the church house he wants to be real in your life he doesn't want you moving on a hopo come on he wants you moving on a noo your knowledge must not remain in the realm of head on it's got to drop it's got to come from your head to your heart as long as your faith remains here as long as your truth remains here it's just information right good information but once it drops the only thing that can make it drop is Anointed faith faith can grab that word from your knower come on from your thinker and pull it right down into the deeper recesses of who you really are Soul and Spirit and once that word is quickened to you in Soul and Spirit in the Inner Man you receive like Moses a transformation from relating to God as only a master and we his slaves you begin to relate to him as one who has invited you to cooperate with his eternal plan he didn't just create you to serve him and when we think of serving the lord we often think of subservient and less than and not nearly enough and we have to uh hope and and work to get somewhere else God God doesn't want to reveal himself to you like that he wants you to know that he could have chosen to call anybody that has ever lived on the face of the Earth he could have chosen them all if he would have desired to he could have left you out of your family when he was choosing but he cared about you before you were ever born he knew your name before your mother and father ever had manifestation on the earth he already knew your name he already knew where you would be just like he knew where Moses was going to be he didn't come down looking for him he came down to meet him when you receive the revelation of the Quicken word for the hour you receive the beginning of a Transfiguration the beginning of a transformation on the inside that works its way through to the outside amen it's a process the word that comes to you is enough but it's a process it's not seeing how many times you can go to church it's seeing how many times you can have an encounter well my faith is not just based on experiences mine isn't either mine is actually based on the inherency of the word and when I read the word I read that God wants to meet man he not only wants to pull you to where he is he longs to come down and walk where you are and he no longer desires to be IM Emmanuel a a god with us but his ultimate desire from the beginning not an afterthought from the beginning his ultimate desire was to come down and live in you to walk in you you ought to be careful what you say you ought to be careful what you think you ought to be careful where you go because you're dragging Elohim y not only the God and creator of the Heaven and Earth but The God Who longs to have intimate fellowship with you you're dragging him to those places you're submitting him to those thoughts you're exposing him to those words words and to those behaviors and to those actions somebody said are you trying to strike fear in their heart no Godly conviction and reverence there is an absence of the fear of the Lord in this hour stay with me somebody if only a few of you will we'll be all right there is an absence of holy fear and holy reverence in this hour in fact the the most of the fear of the Lord that we encounter is an UNG Godly and unhealthy fear of the Lord It's one that that walks around cowering afraid that a that a god of Heaven wearing a white wig is going to crack you on the head with his big old sledgehammer and watch your head Dash into a thousand pieces and your intelligence spill out like little seeds on the ground that's not the right fear of the Lord the reverential fear of the Lord is what we need to see in our lives and what we need to carry in the body of Christ a reverential fear which is an awe it's an awe it's a wonder that this great God hallu this great God would long to come and live in me if that doesn't make you want to live right and walk right and dress right and talk right and spit white I don't know what would if knowing that God longs to come and join himself you you see it's not just that he needed another house to live in he didn't just want to come and make a Tabernacle in you he wanted to come a oh should we say should we say he wanted to come and join himself now I felt you then thank you join himself with you you talk about a Transfiguration you talk about a real transformation when God himself comes and he not only just dwells in you but he starts calling you to Oneness with him it's more than a comingling it's a transformation you see we were told and I happen to believe it that in the last day that Jesus was our example he was the the word made flesh he was the beginning of the father's creation before the father before the eternal spirit of God created anything he created a son do you understand that Jesus is the beginning of the father's creation that's powerful it's wonderful to know but when Jesus became the manifested Son of God in the earth he was as John tells us in the beginning was the word and he didn't just say the word went out from God he said and the Word was was God and the word became flesh somebody said did you look that up do you know what that flesh means did did you did you study to see what that flesh means guess what it means flesh flesh oh I know I know we don't have women preachers in this day but but I grew up under one and when she would get to something like this my old granny would say I want you to reach over and pinch yourself can can I ask you to do what big mama would ask you to do if she were here tonight reach over and just don't hurt yourself come on don't be silly just reach over and pinch yourself flesh somebody say flesh did you feel it flesh the word of God became flesh and dwelt Among Us come on revealing to us the glory of the father and we were told that in the last days it was the father's plan and I believe it lines up with the book that the word should become what flesh again now when we look at that we could say uh that the word wants to be fleshed out in us it's okay to say it that way as long as you pinch yourself and understand that flesh means flesh it means flesh and Bone it's not some code word for something that is only spiritual it's something so powerful that we will only be able to experience it for a short amount of time because even with Glory transformation this body and its systems were not created to contain for any period of time especially eternity the fullness of the glory of God brother sister we can only take a little of it now when that Pres presence comes I wished you were here with me when his presence comes and sometimes we don't know what to do with ourselves right and they mock us because we can hardly behave ourselves and brother brandom tells us we should be careful about those things we shouldn't get out of so out of ourselves that we don't even really know what's going on you know we we we should a as much as possible we should find some some form decency and order we we we we shouldn't just perhaps swing from the light fixtures more than once or twice we wouldn't want anybody just to make a pig of themselves there there has to be some some sort of of order among us but how in the world a a man can take a hold of a power that created Ed the universe and flung The Stars out into space a God who spat and the oceans appeared and he created the mountains by putting his hand on the fresh clay of the earth that big God that powerful expansive uncontainable God wants to touch your life and then you are Ed by Church anity to stand as though you you didn't even know you had come into the presence of almighty God you you you're to stand there like an Episcopalian there are too many episcopalians gathering around the message of the hour we need more Pentecostals not by denominational system but by experience we need some more screaming crying shouting nodding acts 238 babies and they won't stay babies in the presence of this mature word this mature word will cause them to grow up into the stature of the perfect man that perfect man was not William brandham that perfect man was Lord Jesus Christ we're growing up into the stature of the Lord Jesus Christ so we don't remain babies we don't tble forever we we don't lose control forever but we never want to lose our experience with God we don't ever want to quench the Holy Ghost because the Bible tells us that sinning against the Holy Ghost is blasphemy and so we want to be careful not only not to blaspheme but we don't want to quench him we don't want to cut him off because he not only wants to occupy your space he wants to become one Oneness come on it's Oneness it's a spiritual transformation and when he has become one in you with you with your inner being with your redeemable part it cannot help but execute a change even in your physical body and the word of God to become flesh again in the lives of Believers for all my lie I believe it I believe it with all my faith I don't care what they say I don't care what critics say what Skeptics say God will never force you to be a part of this great move of the spirit but if you so desire that kind of place with him you've just got to change some of the places you're walking you can't Wade through the Slime and the swamp of this life and expect to be transformed into Oneness with Christ you're going to have to find the secret chamber you're going to have to find the Hoopa you're going to have to find the bridal chamber you're going to have to find the little room inside the tent the tent in the tent on you're going to have to find that little chamber where you go in one way and you come out M Jesus Christ and you operate in the authority of that name and that name is so powerful that it transformed Moses Hallelujah and he's one of the only prophet in the Bible mentioned as being like unto Christ Moses was a perfect type of the Christ to come now how could he be that he could only be that because of what he received in the revelation of the name and the presence of almighty God he said I want to be to you the yod V I want to be to you the Yahweh The God Who desires Union and Oneness and fellowship is anybody with me now one of the reasons why we linger in getting to that place is because we have focused on only one dimension of sin and I want to take just a few moments tonight to to point out to you that biblically scripturally sin is not just onefold it has more than onefold may I say that as the prophet taught us sin is unbelief and unbelief is the foundation and the root of all dimensions of sin all of the attributes of sin can be found in the foundation of unbelief unbelief is the root so you know in in Holiness where I came from uh everything was sin and they would tell you that's sin that's sin and they couldn't agree on on on on what was sin but they had some things they were pretty sure pretty sure that Coca-Cola was sin but they weren't too sure about chocolate cake and they were pretty sure that that uh some were pretty sure that cocacola was sin but you could have a Double Cola and then the clear soda came and they said well surely it it's all right and you as you've heard me say you you had to wear and I don't mean a head covering I mean a hat like a big one like a like a you know a big hat you you some places you had to wear a sisters had to wear a a big hat on their head and that got a little out of hand because then they needed feathers for them and so they just couldn't stay with a simple little headcut they had to get bigger and better you know and wider and it got out of hand because they're all trying to find out just how far we can go and be all right and then they came around and said well long is long if if you cut it off and it's still long it's long and they they begin to say all kinds of things and uh they said well we shouldn't cut our hair but if we if we fry it off if we burn it off with chemical then that ought to be all right and they didn't understand that none of these things in them themselves right we're sin the problem was unbelief the problem was submitting to the authority of the word it the problem was a a a problem with authority and so they would see just how close to the world they could get and still maintain the title of a Christian if that is your philosophy and approach you'll never know this [Music] Oneness the Oneness that I'm talking about about is going to hurt you it's going to cost you [Music] something it's going to cost you some there you're going to feel at times like you're cutting off your own arm you you you you'll nearly have a funeral for things that you turn loose of things that have once meant so much to you are you still here yes you'll grieve them you'll miss them but you'll understand that there is nothing amen that is worth knowing that you are coming into a relationship of Union and Oneness with the Lamb of God I want to walk with the lamb are you with me I want to talk with the lamb I want to stroll with the lamb as we have sung in years past I want to move in synchronization with with the lamb that's the Oneness that is promised to us and and it takes a calling out and a scouring message to bring us into that new level of dedication I heard that Prophet say we have gone as far with God as we're ever going to go until we're willing to pay a greater price and so while some of you sit and negotiate with these things Amen brother while some of you call all of your emotions together and have a little conference with yourself and you decide whether or not it's too valuable to to turn loose of or or or too valuable you better hold on to it while you're doing all of that the word of the hour the word of God the maturing truth of God just keeps marching on and it's not going to slow down for you to make up your mind you'll have to run and catch up with him so this is what Grieves me the most it's when I see people wasting not their time your time is nothing wasting his you're wasting his because he moves from eternity excuse me into time to help us and we need his help he has no desire to to only uh move in time he desires to bring eternity into your heart you were created for Eternal things you were created of Eternity from eternity you understand that don't you and you are placed and really strapped you're strapped by time we're imprisoned by time but one of these days one of these days so while you're negotiating about how short is short and how long is long and whether or not there were this many that fell off or didn't fall off and and while you're negotiating about whether or not uh uh you you can wear a little of makeup or not not not too much or while you're negotiating and playing around the mature word of God's not stopping for you it's going to keep right on marching on it can't wait for you to get emotionally excited again that word can't be still it just keeps marching on and this is where so many in the brandom movement have made terrible terrible choices because they have chosen to build their Tabernacles and stay so many of them have lged another night or two in the plains of the Wilderness when the word of the Lord came and said get out of her come on and come into me get into me get out of Babylon get out of Babylon get out of confusion and come to me not just come to me yeah come into me you were chosen in him you were in him when you were chosen and you're going to be in him when you're finished that's right yeah yes sir amen so we are only dealing with a little part of sin which is unbelief that's the foundation of all sin all of these other things are attributes of sin but the Bible is pretty clear here I don't have time to go through all the verses let's see it's 7:55 I don't have time to go through all the verses but you'd be surprised at how many times in English in the Old Testament sin iniquity and transgression shows up in the same verse all of it falling under the blanket of sin all of the root of it is unbelief please understand I'm not disputing what we've heard sin is unbelief belie it's an unbelief problem that leads to sin but but sin in itself lays spiritually on the surface and if we had time we'd go to Isaiah 55 we would talk about uh the wounding the stripes is that 54 or 55 uh the wounding and the stripes and the transgression bruised for our iniquities and the chat but we we don't have that time now but we will go back and and perhaps hit that another time I want to show you as quickly as I'm capable of doing that when we look at many of these scriptures we find that there are three distinct Hebrew words that are used here for sin translated in English as Sin iniquity and transgression or sin transgression and iniquity and when we look at them carefully in the original language we come to find out that they actually seem to represent increasing levels of falling short of the glory of God you see Romans 3:23 indict us all for all have sinned all have been victim to unbelief for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God do you understand that in Leviticus oh stay with me please Leviticus 16:21 this is the scripture about aaz the scapegoat and Aaron the high priest shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live goat and confess over him all the iniquities of children the children of Israel and all their transgressions in all their sin sin is the is the unbelief it's the root of it all and upon that or transgressions and iniquities all three phases of unrighteousness were to be pronounced and symbolically placed on the head of the goat and the Goat the scapegoat was to be sent Away by the hand of a fit man Into the Wilderness are you familiar with how that took place nearing the day of atonement we understand the fall feast and how these things seem to come together now if you will put up for me if you happen to to put the other Leviticus 16:21 that I gave you that has the it has the Hebrew numbers uh put in I don't know if you all uh if I made it I didn't didn't make a note of anything but did you happen to put that one in so that the people could see I gave that to you because I just wanted the people to see the Hebrew number plugged in to show you that each of those words sin iniquity and transgression has its own Hebrew word with its own Hebrew number and if you didn't do that that's perfectly fine for instance in iniquities is Hebrew 5771 uh and then all their trans not yet all their transgressions was Hebrew 6588 even all their sins is Hebrew 2403 do does anybody understand those numbers they are numbers of Hebrew words and Greek words they appear that way in Strong's Concordance his numbering system is one of the ones that's used throughout most of the Bible resources when you get into a little bit higher level of study you may find the numbers vary just a little bit if you're using uh thank you so much if you're using a different form of a Hebrew lexicon or a Greek Lexicon of course it doesn't show the contrast uh that it does in my notes because we only have really one color to deal with here but notice that each one of these words iniquity sin and transgression all has its own Hebrew word therefore its own Hebrew number now words in Hebrew can be similar they can be cousins and one they can be brothers and sisters one can be the root of another but each time a slightly different word slightly different pronunciation and a different number is a signed so that you will know that this is a different degree of the root so the root word is here and there may be many other words that are laid on on top of that root to indicate degrees for instance the word hatred when English says God hates you want to look and see how that hatred appears in the original language because it could possibly be uh hatred can possibly be in its root form dislike wouldn't that make people happy if sin was just something he disliked but when you start looking a little deeper there you'll find out that there are degrees of God's hatred and disgust in fact the Bible says there are certain things that are an Abomination you know that word Abomination yes it means abor yes a BH R abhor it's the strongest degree of hate God may say I hate such and such and such but if he says I abhor it or it is an Abomination to me you must know that it is the strongest degree of hatred that God has in his in in in his ability he doesn't just dislike it now when the Bible tells us that it is an abomination for a woman to wear that which pertaineth to a man or a man to put on a woman's garment or vice versa the word that is used there is abomination strongest degree of hatred God abhor he hates it in context the word that is used there is likely referring to a soldier's uniform so the church at large they say this couldn't have any meaning today because women are not trying to wear Soldiers uniform well they are they are doing it sir but remember remember this isn't just something God said I don't care for it's something that God said I abore it's an Abomination to me I hate it to the to the to the strongest degree are there any Holiness people here tonight to the strongest degree I hate it so we've got to discover if that has any application for us today amen you see there are certain things that that we can't really find how we would apply them to our life today because there's no Temple standing you and I have become the temple amen of the most high God and so there are certain laws and Commandments that apply to Temple Ministry and to the offering and sacrificial system that we wouldn't really know how to apply to our everyday life and that's why modern Judaism has built these fences we we learn around the Commandments with some interpretation to try to tell us what it could possibly mean so that we don't ever cross up those Commandments are you following me and you know this because the the Bible says that you should not see a kid in its mother's milk you shouldn't boil a calf in its mother's milk what does it mean it means exactly what it says and any of you Farmers or any of you that have cared for Animals surely you understand that there must be some sense of morality come on even though an animal has no soul there must be some sense of care and concern and even morality that we would show toward even an animal created to serve us [Music] and it just doesn't seem uh to to be right here is a is a mother cow giving you milk and has just given birth to a little calf and you take that calf and you go out and kill it because you want to eat ve and you decide I'm going to use the mother's milk as an ingredient to prepare the veil the baby cap it just doesn't seem right it's like serving Fried Chicken to a chicken it just doesn't seem right and the laws some of the laws were set in place to teach us us that there should be a measure of Morality In all of God's kingdom and all of his creation but the Jews because they didn't quite get exactly what this commandment was about today not being very many farmers among them so they start making these fences and they say that it is a a a a transgression of a commandment to eat meat and dairy together the mother representing the meat and the kid representing uh I mean the the baby the ve representing the meat and the mother's milk representing the dairy now for me that's a stretch right but their desire was to make sure that you don't transgress what you don't completely understand so there are many different levels of Commandments and some people say I thought we were under grace and so none of the Commandments of apply but may I just say this God may have changed the dispensation from a dispensation of the deadness of the law to the living reality of Grace yes sir that doesn't necessarily mean that God has now decided that what I once [Music] hated I will now tolerate so there are certain certain things that are an Abomination to the Lord a proud look yes sir a lying tongue one who SWS Discord among the Brethren and when a woman wears that which pertaineth to a man not the same verse not the same chapter not the same book but the same word this it's an Abomination God said I hate that he wanted to make sure that that we understand the difference in the genders not binary like they say today are my pronouns are them and there I want you to know that I cannot help but cackle laugh out loud right when someone says my pronouns are them and their yeah and you want to say where are the rest of y'all plural pronouns for a singular individual now you know that God saw that as that Spirit would begin to mature that it would not just be slacks and a skirt but it would be so wicked and so awful and evil that they would wear uh the wrong underclothes and not on the inside but even on the outside they would go to town women go to town in boxer shorts men's underwear that's not made to be M's quiet it's not made to be on the outside you're supposed to cover that stuff up and we're not living in the in in in the clabo days roll them up roll them up girlies we're not living in that hour we've got to maintain a sense of modesty and we must be a shining example to a world around us that if God hated for a woman to put on a Man's armor as a soldier in the Army he said I hate that that's the word that used right that seems to be the context of of that scripture then there's something deeper at stake here it's not just a woman pretending to be a soldier that he has a problem with it's the blending of the genders like Grace Jones and some of those who came on the scene many years ago who couldn't know they didn't seem to know which they were and now we're living in an hour that what has been uh uh you know relegated to the closet and to private is now paraded on the streets of this nation on and the church says we've got to be tolerant and inclusive well then we've got to figure out quickly how to hate the sin and Reach In Love For The Sinner on because we must not compromise with a spirit that confuses the genders and it must go all the way through the scripture because here we come to the New Testament and God said I suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over a man just a further installment of the distinction oh somebody said you don't think a woman can preach like a man oh my goodness you've never heard me say that I think some of the greatest preaching that I've ever heard in my life women did it but that doesn't mean that they should have or that they were supposed to oh wow I know you're holier than I am and you would never be able to say that you receive something under a woman's Ministry but remember this little message that the prophet came to us with uh doing God the service without being in the center of his will and uh so just because they do it well and with greater compassion and determination and a lot quicker they say yes a lot quicker than old stubborn men folks doesn't mean they should do it because from the Old Testament Torah all the way through the Book of Revelation there are principles that we must see maintain and one of them is that genders should be kept separate their hair should be maintained differently their clothing should be different and of course somebody would come along and say I don't get my britches in the men's department and I don't I don't do this and that and the other I'm not interested in where you buy them I'm interested in what they pertain Ain to that's what the verse says what they pertain to and so we got to watch some of this stuff because there's a perversion that works its way into this hour and it if you think the church will not be touched Church won't be touched by that kind of oh yes it will yes it will now let's get back to the subject at hand please for forgive me for taking extra time but please don't forgive me for what I just said because I'm making no apology for it none whatsoever you you understand none no apology at all now let's look at the word sin quickly oh my oh my Hebrew 2403 sin an offense as in a single event sin is anything that comes short of the glory of God anytime unbelief takes a hold and leads out of your life it causes you to come short of the glory of God it could fall under Hebrew 2403 translated into English simply sin we don't want any part of sin we want the sin problem solved we want the unbelief out of our life so that we can move forward can you say Amen now in Hebrew the meaning of sin is this slipping away from where you should be you see there's a path to walk in and when you when your feet start slipping around and you start stepping off the The Path sometimes it's just a steady yourself but you're getting off the track the Hebrew understanding of sin is it's just that just slipping from the road from the path do you follow me it can also mean airing From the Path on which God's put you if God has put you on a path and you start wandering off of that path you see it may not be a Commandment that you step away from it may be a calling you you may be a Jonah trying to run from your call you might be a man or woman running from the presence of the Lord and that in itself qualifies under the Hebrew understanding of sin to run in the opposite direction I know you're sleepy and you're hungry and give me some more time would you I I I I just just stepping away from God's divine call on your life can be considered under the Hebrew understanding sin and what is the foundation of sin unbelief so unbelief would cause you to step out how do you know so much about stepping out of God's I've done it and I'm not boasting about it I've done it I've stepped out of my calling and when you do that you can get in big trouble with God because it's the same thing as slipping away away from a commandment according to the Hebrew understanding in the Bible this Old Testament was written in the Hebrew language number three you are not achieving a standard that God has set for your life that that's considered in the Hebrew concept of the word s sin it's sin when you are not raising your life up to the standard that God has called you to that's right which is a spirit of Excellence I want you to know that God didn't call you to be a mediocre Christian no a lukewarm believer a Pew [Music] warer he called you to operate like Daniel with an excellent spirit amen and when you're not moving in that Spirit of Excellence you're not achieving the standard that God has set for you according to the Hebrew Bible you're you're sinning you're under the curse of sin right because sin is unbelief and what makes us do something like that is it's it's unbelief it also means missing the Mark or the path any voluntary transgression of the Divine Law or violation of a Divine command the biblical concept of sin consists not only of actions but also of neglect of known Duty when a father refuses to be a father when a mother refuses to be a mother right when a husband refuses to be a husband or a wife refuses to be a wife when a preacher refuses to preach and a singer refuses to sing right and a musician sits on their gift amen when an amener takes a vacation from from supporting and backing the word of God anytime we we step away there are sins of commission and sins of omission and in Hebrew this concept is very clear you are not only guilty of unbelief when you do something contrary to the law you are guilty of unbelief when you fail to do something something that God is asking you to do and you know what folks the the most that God is asking of you is to give him your life are you listening yes sir so neglect of known duty all evil thoughts purposes words and desires whatever is contrary to God's commands or laws this Falls under the Hebrew understanding of the word and concept of just sin s i n the biblical concept okay now therefore we can say that brother brandham his Revelation that sin is unbelief is an accurate summary of all that sin can be including its origins in the hearts of men and women so it all starts with unbelief are you there yes the Greek meaning of sin is a missing of the mark very similar very similar when you read the word sin I think you have that when you read the word sin in the New Testament it means something very similar to the word sin in the Old Testament in the New Testament it means a missing of the mark number one number two it means an act and I might not have given it to you so don't worry an act of disobedience to the Divine Lord to the to the Divine Creator you might find it interesting that the English word for sin we've talked about the Hebrew word and the Greek now we talk about the English word for a moment the English word of sin comes from [Music] archery in archery the Archer aims at the Target he draws back the string of the bow placing the arrow in position he aims at the center of the target the bullseye that's what he wants to hit sometimes he knows that his bow has to be adjusted and he hadn't had a chance to have it completely sighted so he has to adjust just a little because he learns the way that his Arrow Falls it's pretty important this stuff so he draws back and in just the right time he releases the string sending the arrow to its Target in the early days of organized archery the person who was the official over the competition when he saw that an arrow had missed the bullseye he yelled sin because the concept in English of sin is aiming at a Target but missing the bullseye what is our answer our answer Lord is for all have come short of the glory of God we've all at times in our life aimed and missed the Mark here is the key we don't quit trying we don't quit crying out to God we don't quit practicing we keep working until we get it right we keep strengthening ourselves in the presence of the Lord saturating ourselves with his glory and his anointing until we become strengthened in the Inner Man so that we know exactly how to hit the target that's right every time are you still with me oh a few more minutes then we look at the word transg transgression really quickly it's a Greek word it's it's uh it it's a primitive root it's also uh it's also translated from a Hebrew word it it means to stride it it comes from a root word see here you can see an example that 6586 comes from the root of 6585 is that right to stride from to walk away from willfully now the concept of sin in both Old and New Testament is something on the surface so we repent and it's wiped off the blood of the blood of the Lamb him that's why you still find scriptures referring to the covering of the blood the blood covers the blood covers aren't you glad because it's talking about this surface unbelief you put the blood on that and you wipe it clean and it is as though it's never been there again before and and it come and you do it again you miss the Mark again and you repent and it's it's covered it's wiped off it's surface but when we start looking at transgression it goes a little deeper than the than the skin it goes deep it begins to to affect us from the inside out because it's a willful decision you didn't plot in sin come on you start plotting and planning under transgression you may have missed the mark unwillfully in sin by the time you come to the transgression which is the deeper level of unbelief you're hardly even trying to hit the target you just walks over there like a a a a fool with hob nailed shoes and you just grab up the bow and you don't care whether you hit the target or not you're not interested in in in the end of the game You've Got Your Eye Off the prize and all you want to do is get your turn over with you understand the difference and so you just halfheartedly oh I've got to go to church on we're going to hear the same off bang hello I I I he he he called brother brandom's name 23 times and Jesus's name 10 times you you you're caught up in things that don't really matter in the in the full concept of where we are in this late hour so you're barely even trying to hit the target you're just agitated and aggravated with yourself and with everybody around you you see your unbelief is no more surface it's no more just unbelief on the skin it's now gotten deeper into your inner being and you just quite frankly don't care anybody with me I'm going to step out of the pull pit to say this because it's a little a little slangy the world says things like this you just don't give a hoot I I know that's don't don't say that don't repeat that children don't say that but you just don't really care who thinks what what does it really matter you you even get under something where sometimes somebody will speak to you and you won't even speak back you're just so full of your unbelief you're not even pretending anymore you understand saying it gets deeper and it takes a deeper Deliverance I want you to know that every time unbelief is driven deeper into the inner part of who you are your deliverance is more difficult and your freedom is harder to achieve and sometimes the process gets longer because you are rewiring your brain you are rewiring your belief system right wow the things you used to worry and and fret and you were concerned about getting them right now you just don't care the unbelief has gone deeper into who you are and and so it's going to be a little bit more of a process to get you out and you don't mind people knowing I don't care you come to church and you you lay on the pew yeah or you lay over on your spouse there's a time to be cozy and this is not the house for coziness this is not your bedroom this is not your wreck Hall this is God's house where we come to be instructed we come to learn and we come to experience the almighty God I'm not angry I'm just laying it out very plainly so you won't have to leave with so many questions that transgression gets deep in there look look it says it says to stride away from walk away from willfully to break away from just Authority not just Authority just authority to trespass to apostasis to quarrel yeah by the time your spirit becomes quarrelsome your soul has already started winning mind will and emotion here we go unbelief has already started taking a hold and your decisions are no longer based on righteousness and Faith they now begin to be based on emotion and demonic influence anybody with me to to apostasy to quarrel you've got an argumentative spirit because unbelief has taken a hold there are people who are going to argue my granny used to say my mama used to say they would argue with a sign board they just live and breathe to be contrary just a moment I'm not getting enough help from you Amen brother that's nothing but the truth they live and breathe to be argumentative and it's a it's a fruit it's a fruit that your unbelief has moved from the surface level of sin down into that dimension of transgression and that's not something you'll W up here to the altar sachche up here to The Altar and and and and knock off you'll have to lay that out before the Lord you won't get in a good service and get just free from that you'll have to get up under this thing and start calling out to the Lord I want you to go down Beyond The Sur surf of of unbelief I want you to start digging around in here where transgression has started trying to take a [Music] hold transgression oh oh excuse me apostasis quarrel offend Rebel Revolt you're after the shock Factor you want to shock Somebody by your new decisions and new ideas transgression is a willful act of disobedience it's not just I happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and I did the wrong thing no no no no transgression is a willful act of Disobedience it's a transgress look at this it's a transgression done it's an act of sin it's an act of unbelief specifically to put your finger in God's nose and say I know better but I choose to do what I want to do somebody said that sounds like a teenager it does doesn't it and where did they learn that behavior come on brother because I get that sometime from [Music] parents I know what the word said I know what the message said come on and then we look at the word iniquity it's a it's the Hebrew word a Awan it means perverseness to bend are you still listening bless your heart you're faithful I hope that's some mighty good soup and sandwiches you you ladies have prepared for these people they're going to be famished it means to bend to twist to distort bowed down Twisted to be bent or crooked yeah to be rung out of course it's a masculine noun remember in Hebrew nouns are are masculine and feminine and they are spelled differently pronounced differently in fact they're entirely different words in Hebrew a table can be male or female in the language of Hebrew and so it's a masculine noun means meaning iniquity evil guilt and Punishment Injustice we go on Injustice unrighteousness it's a deviation from rectitude listen morally and and what is rectitude it's morally correct thinking or behavior when we start deviating from morally correct thinking or behavior we're no longer under the influence of unbelief sin on the surface level we're no longer under unbelief on the level of it being a transgression just a willful decision but when we start moving into that depth that unbelief takes such a hold of us that it becomes an iniquity that's when we start affecting generations to come you see your surface unbelief is the effect that it will have on someone else is minimal you know why because everyone is dealing with the same kind of struggle when you start choosing to yield and make decisions based on unbelief you start having influence over people when that thing moves into the level of an iniquity which is a generational sin you start affecting your physical form form your DNA starts responding to your iniquity I can show you that at some point and and and it passes through your DNA and RNA to your children and your grandchildren and your great-grandchildren we've Al often wondered Through The Years how that a man who struggles with alcohol will often see the next generation struggling struggling with alcohol and the Next Generation struggling with alcohol and in times past in years of not understanding we said well it was just coming under the influence we now know scientifically that that's not exactly the case that there is such a perversion that takes place that it affects our DNA and our RNA the chains of our DNA are affected in fact scientifically they they do exactly what the scripture says they twist they Bend they transform and instead of you passing down your original chain of DNA and RNA you're now passing down something a a chain uh of cells that has been affected come on and so your children come along and they have a a a predisposition an unusual makeup to fall into the same kind of rebellion that you fell into and I'm going to tell you something you're you're responsible you and I are responsible for what we are passing genetically to our children of a spiritual origin and there's only one thing that can cancel and correct that and thank you thank you Lord thank you Lord that you didn't leave us victims of our own stupidity and evil hearts and and our lives of wasted year oh thank you Lord that you made a way to heal and repair us and those that we have already affected by deep-seated and rooted iniquity Mo it's it's a deviation from rectitude which is morally cor correct thinking or behavior also want of rectitude in principle wickedness or any Act of Injustice this is one of the four main words indicating sin in the Old Testament the word that is used for iniquity it indicates a particularly evil sin since it is strong it strongly conveys the idea of twisting or perverting something deliberately the noun also carries the idea of guilt from conscience wrongdoing the perversion as he put up there just a moment ago the perversion can literally change the DNA RNA structure of the cells in our flesh body and greatly shift our mental beliefs or attitudes resulting in genetic Chang that are passed on from generation to generation you see if we struggle with our faith and in our mind we are looking for ways out come on and shortcuts around but for the sake of our our children we never speak them out loud unfortunately we affect them anyway so even though we don't express it in front of them we have already marked them and we have a responsibility to break that thing and did you know you can do it can I do it for myself absolutely by his blood by his word by his grace can I do it for my children absolutely and must do it because the buck stops here the responsibility starts here it's right here it stops here it starts here it's my responsibility because I'm the one that has caught this Revelation that I must become one with the word so anything that hinders me from becoming one with the word I've got to deal with that not only for myself I've got to set the record straight for my children and here's why it's so hard for sometimes for parents to do that because it's going to require you to sit them down and say I was wrong and we think that our children will forsake us if we admit to them that we were wrong let me tell you something they're more likely to appreciate your desire to take responsibility than to push it off on the church or to to blame your neighbor down the road come on are you following me these changes are passed from generation to generation oh my oh my it's late I I have time tomorrow I don't have to do it all this is the way things like high blood pressure alcoholism sexual perversions jealousy anger fear various other addictions and Tendencies toward the perverse are passed down from generation to generation because someone dealt with the surface unbelief and they may have taken the time to dig a little deeper into the into the willful act of a transgression but they let that Spirit of iniquity it's it's a mystery it's a mystery it's now time to understand the mystery of iniquity and to send it an answer it's an antichrist Spirit that's that's not only out to twist twist the truth it's out to twist us and it has to be dealt with and let me tell you something there's another mystery that can fix the mystery of iniquity amen it's the mystery of his righteousness oh yes that I can put on his righteousness I could never be righteous enough I could never be holy enough in my condition my Fallen state but he has given me a robe if I'm willing to repent if I'm willing to take the word over my feelings if I'm willing to live a separated life from the spirit of leod deia if I'm willing to apply myself to truth and become one with him he gives me his robe of righteousness and he not only gives to me and for me he gives it for me to pass down as a generational blessing to my children and to my grandchildren and to my great-grandchildren and it matters yes it matters what you believe it matters what you stand for it will affect the Next Generation it will affect the Next Generation it will affect the Next Generation because these things run in the DNA and RNA at at least four generations so your children your grandchildren your great-grandchildren your great great grandchildren racism greed and idolatry can also run as a spirit of iniquity in Family Lines this is not for you to leave here tonight blaming anyone for your condition no you've got a responsibility because the remedy is in your hands you know what the blood can do you know what the word can do you know what the name of Jesus can do but see this is the problem with our love in Matthew 24:12 musicians are coming this is the problem with our love and because not because sin not because transgressions are everywhere willful sin but because iniquity generational deep seated unbelief with all of its attributes yes sir is present in our nation Even in our churches even in some of our families that are represented here tonight and because not because sin abounds not because transgressions abound stay with me but because iniquity abounds it has frozen our love for Christ I have somewhat ought against you Ephesian Church age now again it baffles my mind that's the first church age if the first church age struggled with cold love don't you think the last Church age is going to struggle with cold love and every age in between if one generation away from the Earthly Ministry of Jesus Christ suffered with their love turning into an ice cube don't you think we'll also have to deal because iniquity is abounding even more in our day than it did in the first church age under the messenger Paul are you still here and so this is part of the reason why we're leaving our first love is because we are not dealing with iniquity in our lives we're petting it and that word iniquity there in Greek is anomia and it means the state or condition of being disposed inclined to what is Lawless law lessness having a tendency or predisposition toward a particular Behavior or sin we hide our sin from our wives we hide our iniquity from our families and they hide it from us our children hide it from their parents come on a pornography addiction that is not dealt with in your life you don't ever have to share it with your children you don't ever have to tell them how to access it you don't ever how to teach them you don't have to teach them how to find it you don't ever have to tell them that you've looked at it or participated in it but if you didn't deal with it before you brought children into the Earth according ording to this scriptural concept and I believe it you have already affected them because you wouldn't deal with it when you had an opportunity to deal with uh alter call after alter call and opportunity after opportunity but you let shame keep you from dealing with well nobody knows it's a victimless sin it's only me that it affects and our children are in their bedrooms dealing with the same kind of spirit no wonder we don't love one another no wonder we don't love Jesus like we should because we come to church so wrapped up in guilt am right we're so guilty when we come you're not coming here to experience your guiltiness you're coming here to experience your forgiveness but we haven't dealt with this thing so not only our love toward one another's affected our love toward him is affected there's some other definitions of iniquity here we might be able to look at them at another time but David found the remedy in Psalm 51:10 create in me oh God my my DNA my RNA the cells of my body have been affected by generational iniquity religious Spirits from my forefathers denominational Spirits from my forefathers or or whatever it is has affected me my my heart has been tainted and my spirit has been greatly affected and so I come to you David I come to you you my iniquity caused me to steal what wasn't mine my iniquity that hadn't been dealt with caused me to lust after something that wasn't mine and steal something that wasn't mine and kill somebody that was not mine to kill to cover up the fact that I had stolen something that wasn't mine because I lusted for something that wasn't mine you understand so he didn't come to the Lord and just say Lord I need a free pass I'm the king and I can't afford for anybody to know how rotten I've been are you listening yes he said create in me can I paraphrase this for you this isn't just scrub my heart this is more on the level of a heart transplant can you take my Twisted heart can you take my heart that is has become darkened and deformed because I have dealt with my Surface sin I have dealt with my willful transgression sin but I have allowed iniquity to pass from Generations before me upon me without dealing with it and now I have swn it into the Next Generation and already perhaps the Next Generation so Lord I don't just need you to scrub my heart for it to be dirty all over again I need a new heart and I don't need you to lift my spirit but I need a totally right upright Spirit placed in me the prophet tells us that not only are there generational sins that pass like this iniquities into families that have to be dealt with spiritually he tells us that there are also generational blessings and gifts so once we deal with the ugly we can start calling forth the blessings do you understand and let me share this in closing in the message God commissioning Moses Jonesboro Arkansas brother brandham said I heard a fellow say the other day that sickness the Lord did sickness put sickness on you that might that might be so if you're sinning You' done something wrong make it right with God that's right that's true but sickness is of the devil so just remember folks sickness is not of God sickness is of the devil if God allows it to come it's still not of God it's of the devil and sickness is an attribute of unbelief now what we find in looking at these words is this it's more or less an attribute of iniquity and not just surface sin and not the occasional willful sin but it's more likely the result of that deep seated iniquity that runs in the family that we haven't completely dealt with it's but he says listen because of sin we had sickness not because maybe you sinned but it's something to come down through the generations he visited even to the but but I don't mind you saying but but the blood of Jesus Christ taken away sin and it taken away somebody said isn't that the wrong case for that word taken no it's done it it's finished so you hear this hillbilly English and you'll know it's already took he said if you David's are ready to claim your place yes sir and he said you mean to tell me that you'll let that Philistine stand out there and defy the armies of the Living God see he starts dealing with the lack of Courage and the lack of faith that has probably fallen on us because we didn't deal with the iniquity can I give you one more just the very next one uh uh hear you him and we and we're done I I'm sorry I am I really am sorry he said and now if you're dealing with sin now maybe you never sined but there might be a sin that your father did your grandfather did he said he'd visit the iniquity of the parent upon the third and fourth generation and each generation gets weaker and wiser as the Bible said but it's all started from sin before sin came into the world there was no sickness in the world and sickness came through the fall and the fall was sin and the sin is unbelief he that believeth not is condemned already before you even get started you're condemned you're born in sin shaped in iniquity molded and you're already molded by iniquity come to the world speaking lies you don't want to say it out loud but it's a truth isn't it we know that about that old nature no matter how much you was dedicated on the altar how many times you were sprinkled baptized poured whatever it is you're still a sinner that's all until you repent and God recognizes and seals that promise with the Holy how important is the holy spirit it finishes the new birth we've got to have it we've got to have him we've got to have the Holy Ghost we've got to have him in our life we can't hope we do or think we do we've got to have the Holy Ghost we've got to have our own encounter with God we've got to meet the pillar of fire for ourselves we've got to be filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire Mama's experience is not enough Daddy's experience is not enough we've got to have it he said that's right then you're born again then you're son and daughter of God it's a regeneration a new creation then your attributes your thoughts are not like they were your life is not like it was you become a complete surrendered vessel to God and he speaks and uses you and you're not your own no more right but you're bought with a price that's the price of the Precious Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ think of it let's stand let's stretch I I I I I intended to do better it's a big subject you must not leave here heavy you must not leave here under uh uh some sort of guilt or condemnation you must understand that if we can deal with that iniquity our love can be unfrozen we can burn with love for Jesus Christ like we did when we first gave him our heart and we can burn with love for one another preferring one another fighting in the Spirit of prayer for one another praying that each and every one of us can overcome not Desiring that any should get what they deserve but believing that every one of us will come to the full maturity of this word this is our heart's desire this is what we believe so Lord we raise our hands to you as Benjamin prepares to come and lead us in a moment of worship we lift our hands to you and we thank thank you from the start we thank you for the blood of the Lamb we thank you that it was not the blood of a Jew or a gentile it was not the blood of a man or a woman it was not a human blood that has redeemed us but it was God's own blood blood specifically created for the power of redemption to buy us back to bring us back to your original thoughts about us if we in any way have been slacked in dealing with sin transgression or or iniquity we come before you believing that your blood is sufficient we repent right now for allowing our own guilt and our own Pride to keep us from laying these things on the altar we repent that it has affected our children and our grandchildren we re we repent that we haven't taken the bloody way for them but tonight as we grow in our understanding of why our love gets cold it doesn't seem like this would be an hour that the bride's love would be affected but that iniquity that Lies Beneath the surface that must be dealt with By The Sword of the word of God not covered by the blood but dug up by the blood it is not a covering that we seek but a mission that so removes this iniquity from our lives that our physical body is remade and reshaped what was once shaped by iniquity oh Jesus may we now be shaped and molded by your righteousness instead of passing down a predisposition for addiction and lust to our children Lord may we now begin to pass on to our children and Grand children a hunger and a desire for your righteousness may we be so burn burning with love consumed by your love until all of the chaff is destroyed in the fury of the flame and only your life Rises Up From the Ashes and brings us into transformation and Transfiguration from a body of Fallen humanity and flesh to to a new existence your word promised that we are New Creations we're not of the old old things have passed away behold all things have become new oh God if there are those among us today who still dabble in in these things we throw no Stones we have no reason to condemn anyone for we have all struggled in one way or another but we pray tonight that they will rise like the prodigal from the pig pin we pray tonight that they will shake themselves and realize that the spirit of the Lord has withdrawn from their lives that they will recognize that the anointing is no longer present and all they have to do is come running back to Papa's house house pray Saints don't just listen to my prayer pray with me would you may they came come running back to Papa's arms carrying a load on their back that they can slip off their shoulder on to The Altar and you will bear it I cry out Lord for my children for my grandchildren if you T and even if I go by the way of the Grave if you T my great grandchildren may I find grave to deal with every demon every warping Spirit may I find no consolation in blaming my parents may I have no desire to shift the blame off on a generation past may I own it if I nursed it if I held on to it if I kept it Lord it was me and I repent before you this evening and I'm asking you to send the sword of your word to the root of anything in me that that closes you out of any portion of my life if there's anything in me that is not of you Lord I want it ripped out and I bring it to you tonight we don't want to just see the surface sin scrub off or the transgression that lays beneath the surface finished so that we no longer choose to willfully sin but we want anything that has formed us and shaped us any iniquity that has affected us the same blood the same Grace the same word the same name is ever sufficient we stand before you if you're here I'm going to just obey the Lord if you're here and you you you somehow can relate you don't have to tell us how but you somehow relate to what was said tonight I and you'd like to see some some not just relief from it but you'd like to see some help deliverance from it would you just walk this way for just a moment I I want want it out I want it out if you're quick to anger and you see that growing in your children come dig it if you're impulsive and you make unwise decisions because you do it too rapidly and you see that thing coming into the life of your children come and get that Dugout tonight there doesn't have to be a wrestling match around the altar we're just coming to surrender we we recognize it we we don't have to we don't have to do some some wrestling here all we have to do is say Lord here it is get it I want you to dig it out of me I want to quit using my words to curse my children I want to quit telling them that that that's just like Grandpa and and and and that's just like your mother and that's just like your father and that's just like your grand I I want to quit putting that on my children I I want to release generational blessing over my children and Grace over their lives and not my desire to see them similar to to the family [Music] line it's one thing for you to want them to have blue eyes but it's another thing for you to stand back and watch them struggle with the things that you struggled with that you've never really allowed the Holy Spirit to root it out tonight we stand here it's quiet and that's okay but we stand in the presence of the Lord right now and we thank you for coming Holy Spirit we thank you for coming right now and we lay all of these things open before [Music] you I encourage you to pray for yourselves for just a [Music] moment Let There Be sincerity in your heart heart you made the decision to come and he has made the decision to meet you here just sing [Music] that create in me a clean heart oh God maybe you'll just sing that as part of your prayer and [Music] R with me don't you stand here with guilt that is not the purpose of this altar call don't you stand here judging and condemning yourself that's not why you came forward you came forward to lay yourself on the operating table and you said Lord there's nothing in me that I want to hold on to I want you to have free access to come and take out what needs to be taken I yield the rest of who I am to you cast me not away from thy [Music] PR and take take not thy Holy Spirit from [Music] me I love this line restore but restore unto me in the name of Jesus the joy of thy Sal I will not walk that way anymore and right spirit for some of you it's a it's it's a tendency to disqualify yourself it's probably come to you in the same manner to take yourself out of the promise to take yourself out of the economy of God I want you to make up your mind tonight I'm going to let the Lord deal with that thing in me once and for all if he said I'm worthy I'm going to take at his word if he said I'm forgiven I'm going to take him at his word if he said I'm a new creature I'm going to take him at his word and I'm going to start living a new creation life somebody tell him that right now somebody make up your mind to make up your mind to make up your mind I am determined I am determined to see myself like the word sees [Music] me cast not away cast me not away from spirit of fear go back where you came from in the name of Jesus I refuse to be Twisted by [Music] fear I will go forth in the confidence and boldness of the Lord Resto I will be strong in his [Music] strength where I have been weak I will confess that I am [Music] strong Spirit within me we say divorce no more we say that the very root of the spirit of division and divorce must stop now now under the Redemption of your word and your promise to the lives that stand around this altar we refuse to see that kind of life pass down to our children what's done is done what we have experienced we have experienced but we call out to you Lord for wholesome holy God ordained marriages for our children marriages without compromise marriages that are founded on the word Spirit within [Music] me rest cast me not away from thy Pence oh Lord take not thy Holy Spirit take not thy Holy Spirit from me I'm going to walk in the freedom but M by the blood of the Lamb to me rehave my thinking reform my processes of thought give me the mind of [Music] Christ it's the promise of your word the last time created me a clean [Music] heart oh God and renew our right spirit [Music] Crea me we've got the right prayer we've got the right God we've got the right token price it's paid for right Spirit within me for some it may be judgmental critical spirits that have passed [Music] down tell the Lord I'm going to get a hold of this thing I'm going to drive my judgmental Spirit out of my life I'm going to take a hold of this criticism for my brothers and [Music] sisters I want this jealousy plunged beneath the blood of the Lamb Resto me the joy the joy of thy [Music] salvation how many of you believe the Lord hears you when you pray like this is there anyone here that that is not sure whether the Lord is hearing you it's all right if you're not but you're just not sure if the Lord is hearing you right now cuz we want to help you get through if you're asking him with sincerity of heart and you're asking him according to his word you can know beyond the shadow of a doubt that he hears this prayer you may walk out of here with the same kind of thought that you came in here with but what you must understand is that you're walking through a process and you might begin to recognize things that you have not recognized before and when you do deal with it deal with it then don't put it off until tomorrow deal with it then get it under the blood now don't live with it another night how many of you know we don't want another night with any frog we want every bit of that out of our Lives

would allow the rain that prepares the ground for SE and the rain that brings the seed to maturity to fall on us in the same season and in the same hour and that we would see the growth and that we

asking you about the service are you glad you've been in the house of the Lord is anybody glad that they've been in the house of the Lord [Music] tonight Hallelujah blessed be the [Music] Lord could I get you to Hold Your Position just for a moment I'm here for Logistics and I may be somewhat of a dictator doing it but we have a lot of mud down down at the fellowship hall so there is going to be very limited Vehicles going down there tonight Joshua Yantis has the golf cart if you want to ride down on the golf cart he's available to take you down on the golf cart I have asked brother Hawke because his van is lower to the ground any of you seniors that want to ride the van down to the bottom brother Hawke will help to get you down there in the van it's easier to get in and out of other than that we need to keep the traffic to the bottom there's not room but to park about six cars down there so I've asked Ben Ellsworth to direct traffic and so we're going to take as few cars down tonight because again there is a lot of mud it rained last night and we don't want anybody stuck we don't want you walking in the mud tracking it in the building and we don't want you to track it back up on to the asphalt so if you will either walk down or ride the golf cart or ride in brother Hawk's van of course brother shelle have already asked Benjamin to take you down in your own vehicle right park right there in front of the vehicle or in front of the Tabernacle but we want to keep the the vehicles to a minimum tonight please make sure if they need assistance getting that they do don't don't oh yeah yeah make sure that yeah don't strug remember it won't always be this way we we we've got we've got Vehicles that'll get you down there so you don't have to walk you you can wait your turn all right so what's that yes the The Far Side is the side that you need to walk down so everybody be real mindful of those that are walking there are lights on the front of the building now so hopefully it will illuminate plenty till that everybody can see and uh the other thing is it is probably going to be cold when you first walk [Applause] [Music] [Applause] in once all 100 plus of us get in there I don't know but I cranked it down to 68 this morning and so that's what it may be when you get in there but let's go have a good time of fellowship and then we'll go home and get rest tonight and uh return at 11:00 tomorrow morning for worship together to hear what the Lord wants to speak to us haven't we heard from the Lord tonight we have heard from the Lord tonight let's ask the Lord to bless our time of fellowship tonight as we leave father it has been so good to be in your presence I Want to Thank You Lord that you hear us when we pray when we call on your name we're thankful for that now as we leave this building we ask you to go with us bless our time of Fellowship we're asking you Lord that you will sanctify the food let it bring nourishment to our bodies we
