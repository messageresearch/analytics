[1:14:03] but you that have come from other places
[1:14:05] you have blessed us this young brother
[1:14:06] who's come in today uh I don't know you
[1:14:09] but I'm so glad you're here brother God
[1:14:11] bless you I don't mind I love for people
[1:14:14] to come and visit but what I really like
[1:14:17] is when someone comes in to praise the
[1:14:20] Lord you know sometimes visitors when
[1:14:22] they come to a place that they're not
[1:14:24] familiar with even I was thinking about
[1:14:26] brother Kade you know they're reserved
[1:14:28] they don't know it's a strange place and
[1:14:30] I have to be honest we're some of the
[1:14:32] strangest people I've ever met in my
[1:14:34] life I've never met any more strange
[1:14:36] folks than us and you come into a place
[1:14:39] like that you think you'd be a little
[1:14:41] you know be a little backward but our
[1:14:42] brother when he came in today he went
[1:14:44] right into praising the Lord and
[1:14:46] worshiping the Lord and that's what
[1:14:48] we're about that's what this is this is
[1:14:51] a house of worship a house of praise a
[1:14:53] house where the word of God can be
[1:14:55] preached and without
[1:14:58] apology we we're not going to apologize
[1:15:00] for the way we do it here you do it your
[1:15:03] way at your place but you come here
[1:15:06] expect us to do it what the way God has
[1:15:08] directed us and let us you're you're
[1:15:10] giving thank you for your giving I want
[1:15:12] to thank this congregation for the food
[1:15:15] that you have prepared for us two times
[1:15:18] already and this afternoon when the
[1:15:20] service is over we will uh go and get
[1:15:22] our our dishes our food for the local
[1:15:26] congregation and we will meet at the
[1:15:28] fellowship hall I'm hoping that they'll
[1:15:30] get the address and put it up at the end
[1:15:32] of the service for people to plug it in
[1:15:34] their GPS but we will meet at the
[1:15:37] fellowship uh Hall they call
[1:15:40] it the dwelling and it is behind the
[1:15:44] Auburn Heights Baptist church and they
[1:15:48] have been gracious enough to to rent us
[1:15:50] their hall for today and uh we are going
[1:15:53] there to have our lunch together and our
[1:15:55] fellowship but oh my nothing that we're
[1:15:58] going to experience over there could
[1:16:00] even begin to compare with what we have
[1:16:03] felt in the meeting so let's get to it
[1:16:06] Psalm 95 beginning in verse one oh come
[1:16:10] let us sing unto the
[1:16:14] Lord let us make
[1:16:18] a a Joyful Noise to the rock of our
[1:16:23] salvation let us come before his
[1:16:27] presence with
[1:16:28] Thanksgiving and Make a Joyful Noise
[1:16:32] unto him with Psalms isn't that what
[1:16:35] we've been doing for the Lord is a great
[1:16:40] God and a great king above all
[1:16:45] gods in his hand are the Deep places of
[1:16:49] the Earth the strength of the Hills
[1:16:53] is his also the sea is his and he made
[1:16:59] it and His Hands formed the dry land oh
[1:17:04] come let us worship and bow down let us
[1:17:11] kneel before the Lord our maker Barack
[1:17:16] we talked about it last night for he is
[1:17:20] our God and we are the people of his
[1:17:24] pasture and the
[1:17:29] Sheep of his hand today if ye
[1:17:34] will how many of you want to hear his
[1:17:36] voice today Father we are come with with
[1:17:40] Full Hearts of adoration and praise for
[1:17:44] who you are we are thankful that you
[1:17:47] have sent a message to gather us
[1:17:50] together as a Clarion call as a an eagle
[1:17:53] scream in these last days we are not
[1:17:56] ashamed to be identified with your
[1:17:59] message of Truth we thank you for
[1:18:01] sending it we thank you for your servant
[1:18:04] that surrendered his life to bring us
[1:18:07] this great truth that has its foundation
[1:18:10] in the scripture we are gathered here
[1:18:13] from various places had it not been for
[1:18:16] you we would have never known one
[1:18:19] another we have never would have never
[1:18:21] met one another perhaps but because of
[1:18:23] you you have ordered our footsteps you
[1:18:26] have directed our paths and you are
[1:18:29] building us up together as a habitation
[1:18:32] as a house of the Lord and we thank you
[1:18:36] for that we know you don't dwell in a
[1:18:38] building made with hands you dwell in
[1:18:40] the hearts and in the lives of your
[1:18:43] people and we thank you for that as we
[1:18:45] approach your word today would you
[1:18:48] whisper to us would you speak to us Lord
[1:18:51] in a profound way that we might go forth
[1:18:54] encouraged to bless your name encouraged
[1:18:58] to praise you as never before and we
[1:19:01] will give you the glory and the honor
[1:19:04] and the praise for it is in the name of
[1:19:06] the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the
[1:19:10] Saints said amen amen you may be
[1:19:16] seated we are speaking last night and
[1:19:19] again today on nine Hebrew through words
[1:19:24] for praise we dedicated the preaching
[1:19:27] part of the month of November for
[1:19:30] Thanksgiving and praise and we focused
[1:19:33] on that as we have often done through
[1:19:36] the years I thought we would be finished
[1:19:39] with that theme and moved on to
[1:19:40] something else come the first part of
[1:19:42] December but we have a few more lessons
[1:19:45] in this we want to understand from God's
[1:19:48] word that praise is in order amen amen
[1:19:52] it's in order it may not be man's order
[1:19:54] but it's Bible order amen I I noticed as
[1:19:58] I mentioned last night some of the
[1:20:00] comments on social media when they see
[1:20:02] our reals and uh we have I don't know I
[1:20:06] think together if you added the two
[1:20:08] platforms together about 250,000 views
[1:20:11] and I don't know how many comments and
[1:20:14] how many thousands of likes and and uh
[1:20:17] you you find that some people just don't
[1:20:19] appreciate the way you all praise the
[1:20:21] Lord and some people think you're just
[1:20:23] getting out of order in God's house and
[1:20:26] they want you to be more
[1:20:28] ecclesiastical does that appeal to
[1:20:31] anybody uh uh they they want us to wear
[1:20:34] vestments you know uh even some on there
[1:20:37] have been calling us to the to the Holy
[1:20:39] Catholic
[1:20:41] Church they they even posted on there
[1:20:43] and said if you want to understand real
[1:20:45] worship you need to come to the Catholic
[1:20:47] church and you know what I'd like to say
[1:20:49] but I want to be kind we're not
[1:20:51] interested in worship in
[1:20:54] Saints we know God doesn't have a mother
[1:20:58] we're not interested in worshiping Mary
[1:21:01] or praying to the apostles we're
[1:21:04] interested in worshiping God I'm amazed
[1:21:07] at how many people don't understand that
[1:21:09] praise and worship is a part of the
[1:21:11] scripture both Old Testament and New
[1:21:14] Testament and so today we look at the
[1:21:17] sixth Hebrew word for praise if you'll
[1:21:20] put that up for us it is
[1:21:23] toila toila it appears 57 times in the
[1:21:28] Old Testament toila means
[1:21:32] adoration usually translated praise Or
[1:21:36] Glory tahila is derived from the word
[1:21:40] Halal do you remember that one from
[1:21:42] Hallelujah meaning the singing of halals
[1:21:46] or the singing of praises to sing or to
[1:21:50] Lad perceive to involve music especially
[1:21:54] singing hymns of the spirit or praise
[1:21:59] this and the word zamar that we talked
[1:22:02] about last night the plucking of the
[1:22:05] strings of the instruments are where we
[1:22:07] get the idea that singing is a part of
[1:22:11] Praise I want you to know singing is not
[1:22:13] all there is to praise you don't have to
[1:22:16] be singing to be praising but one of the
[1:22:19] ways that the Bible tells us to praise
[1:22:21] the Lord is by singing somebody said but
[1:22:25] I can't carry a tune in a bucket you
[1:22:28] know God's not interested in that he
[1:22:30] said Make a Joyful Noise can anybody
[1:22:33] make a Joyful Noise a and you can sing
[1:22:36] in the shower everybody can sing in the
[1:22:38] shower you can feel like a legend in the
[1:22:42] shower nobody is there to judge your
[1:22:46] highs and lows your octaves your Doras
[1:22:51] solos and and you just sing like a rock
[1:22:54] star and I don't mean that you know I'm
[1:22:57] being when when Cade brother Cade from
[1:23:00] North Carolina originally from Indiana
[1:23:02] when he was out here this morning
[1:23:04] running over his song I don't know him
[1:23:06] well uh but he is visiting from a sister
[1:23:10] church and uh I I heard them little
[1:23:13] tickling you know Jonathan we're used to
[1:23:15] that tickling of the of the ivies and he
[1:23:18] came back there to the back and with the
[1:23:19] straightest face that I could find I
[1:23:22] said brother you're going to have to
[1:23:23] hold that down a little bit we don't do
[1:23:26] rock and roll around
[1:23:28] here little bit of the color drained
[1:23:31] from his face and and I said and they
[1:23:34] and the the rest of the gang said he's
[1:23:36] just
[1:23:37] kidding and so I went over to the app
[1:23:40] and I played the song off of our church
[1:23:42] app that I recorded in the '90s singing
[1:23:45] the song that he sung today my offing
[1:23:47] and Otis Forest is I mean he is really
[1:23:50] getting the keys of the piano I remember
[1:23:53] when that came out and I remember what a
[1:23:56] stir it caused among our ranks they
[1:23:59] thought for sure that we had gone to
[1:24:01] rock and roll but I want you to know
[1:24:03] when the anointing
[1:24:06] Falls I remember Otis Forest he's gone
[1:24:09] to be with the Lord now but he was a a
[1:24:11] great producer in Nashville and when he
[1:24:14] finished playing for me the Holy Ghost
[1:24:17] you'll see him on Gaither videos playing
[1:24:19] the piano a time or two and when he got
[1:24:23] through playing for me the Holy Ghost
[1:24:24] will set your feet of dancing and by the
[1:24:26] way brother Billy Paul brandham had sent
[1:24:28] me a letter that I have and he said
[1:24:30] brother Shelly I want some of those
[1:24:32] tapes to give away as at Christmas time
[1:24:35] he said my favorite song is the Holy
[1:24:37] Ghost will set your feet to
[1:24:39] dancing brother vom's oldest son and
[1:24:43] when when Otis Forest got through
[1:24:45] playing that he literally shook his
[1:24:48] hands like that and he said it felt like
[1:24:50] fire in my fingers uhhuh he said I
[1:24:53] haven't felt anything like that so when
[1:24:55] we begin to sing to the Lord when we
[1:24:58] begin to praise to the Lord when we
[1:25:01] begin to use what he has given us to
[1:25:03] praise him isn't it beautiful that he
[1:25:05] will pour His Spirit on it and he will
[1:25:08] anoint us to praise boy that is that
[1:25:12] that is so amazing to me here the Bible
[1:25:15] calls us to make a sacrifice of praise
[1:25:18] so we bring what little bit we have and
[1:25:21] what does God do he pours oil on it and
[1:25:24] he said I want to increase that I want
[1:25:26] to anoint that I don't only want to
[1:25:29] receive that for myself but I want the
[1:25:31] glory of that to spill over on somebody
[1:25:35] else last night when we were I think it
[1:25:38] was last night when it was time to go
[1:25:41] through the line and after the service
[1:25:43] and we called the visitors this little
[1:25:45] brother right here Isaac is that no what
[1:25:48] is your name brother Isaac uh I said you
[1:25:50] all go ahead go ahead go through the he
[1:25:52] said well you know I found out sometime
[1:25:54] that it just takes somebody going ahead
[1:25:56] just just kind of leading the way and
[1:25:59] then everybody I said go right ahead
[1:26:00] that's right you know it's the same way
[1:26:02] sometimes with worship and praise you
[1:26:05] just get one loose horse in the house on
[1:26:09] you you just get one in the house that's
[1:26:10] so glad to be out of the
[1:26:13] barn you see look around this room some
[1:26:16] of us spent many years in the
[1:26:18] denominational
[1:26:20] barn with everybody trying to calm us
[1:26:23] down trying to get us to act dignified
[1:26:26] and act quiet and show a little more
[1:26:28] Church order and show a little more
[1:26:31] reverence be a be a little more sacred
[1:26:34] they call it but you know when you
[1:26:37] finally get out of the barn and you get
[1:26:40] out from under the Bishop's watchful
[1:26:43] eye you ask some of these former Amish
[1:26:46] you get out from under the Bishop's
[1:26:48] watchful eye and you get into a place
[1:26:50] where you can praise God the way Way You
[1:26:52] Want To Praise Him you wouldn't ever
[1:26:55] want to go back and be locked up in some
[1:26:57] system come on now because what we find
[1:27:00] out is that praise breaks through the
[1:27:03] darkness it opens up the Heavens over
[1:27:06] our lives the Hebrew word is arabah I
[1:27:09] will open the
[1:27:12] windows I will open the slle gates of
[1:27:15] heaven and pour you out a blessing that
[1:27:20] you don't have room enough to contain
[1:27:22] when you seow your praise to the heavens
[1:27:26] you feel the spiritual
[1:27:28] clouds and how many of you know when the
[1:27:31] clouds get so full of moisture they
[1:27:33] can't contain it anymore how many of you
[1:27:36] know what begins to happen it's
[1:27:38] beginning to
[1:27:40] [Music]
[1:27:42] rain hear the voice of the
[1:27:46] father it begins to rain because the
[1:27:49] spiritual clouds can't hold the seed
[1:27:52] that you've been sending up in your
[1:27:54] praise you'll watch God unlock doors for
[1:27:57] you you'll see God open up boxes for you
[1:28:01] you'll see him set you free shackles
[1:28:03] will fall off somebody said we we don't
[1:28:06] need prayer lines well I think we do
[1:28:08] need prayer lines sometime but I'll tell
[1:28:10] you what I believe the ideal way is for
[1:28:12] you and I to create an atmosphere of
[1:28:15] God's praise and glory in this house so
[1:28:18] that while you're standing there or
[1:28:20] sitting there on your seat your faith
[1:28:23] gets anointed and your faith reaches up
[1:28:26] and takes a hold of God's promise to
[1:28:28] your life and you leave here having the
[1:28:31] fruit of what you believed for how many
[1:28:33] of you believe it ought to work that way
[1:28:35] I believe the Holy Ghost was telling us
[1:28:36] today we have authority in our mouth and
[1:28:39] we can speak to the situation somebody
[1:28:42] said that sounds a little bit too modern
[1:28:44] for me or it sounds a little new AG for
[1:28:46] me it sounds like the Bible to me it's
[1:28:49] all in the spoken word it's letting that
[1:28:51] word go go forth do you know when you
[1:28:53] declare the promises of God you are
[1:28:56] prophesying and the spirit of God wants
[1:28:58] to meet that
[1:29:00] prophecy do you know we have been
[1:29:02] holding back so long and limiting God so
[1:29:07] long that we don't even really realize
[1:29:09] what he's capable
[1:29:12] of he's bigger he's bigger than what we
[1:29:14] realize sometime so this word this word
[1:29:18] is a a word that is an imperative some
[1:29:22] to praise Jehovah God it can be in a
[1:29:26] Psalm or a hymn it can be with choirs it
[1:29:29] can be with dancing it can even be with
[1:29:32] expressive
[1:29:35] speaking this word tahila can also mean
[1:29:40] expressive
[1:29:42] speaking speaking under
[1:29:46] inspiration now when brother brandham
[1:29:48] was teaching us about the gifts of the
[1:29:50] Spirit and he was talking about the
[1:29:53] interpretation of tongues one of the
[1:29:56] things that he told us is this it will
[1:29:59] not just be the quoting of a
[1:30:04] scripture we don't need the spirit of
[1:30:07] God to requote the scripture to us
[1:30:09] because the word is forever hid in our
[1:30:12] heart so there are times that you will
[1:30:15] hear someone even in this house give a a
[1:30:19] a word of uh of for instance what we
[1:30:23] heard this morning a reminder I am that
[1:30:26] I am that's not interpretation of
[1:30:29] tongues it's not even really qualified
[1:30:33] as
[1:30:34] prophecy but what it is is an expressive
[1:30:39] inspired word that boils up in the heart
[1:30:44] of a Believer and they
[1:30:46] struggle come on don't you take it for
[1:30:50] granted they struggle for the courage
[1:30:53] they reach for the boldness to be able
[1:30:56] to declare that and when that is spoken
[1:30:59] into the atmosphere and faith is
[1:31:02] attached to that anointed word or speech
[1:31:06] you know it becomes a promise in our
[1:31:08] lives and it becomes a reminder to us so
[1:31:11] we don't need to limit God Amen some
[1:31:14] have come through here and they have
[1:31:16] heard those kinds of expressions and
[1:31:18] they have said you know brother brandham
[1:31:20] said it wasn't going to be that he did
[1:31:22] he said the interpretation of tongues
[1:31:24] would be more than just uh quoting
[1:31:27] scripture but what was not covered in
[1:31:30] that in that description is the fact
[1:31:33] that the Holy Ghost can fall on someone
[1:31:35] and they feel an inspiration they're not
[1:31:39] preachers come on help me a little bit
[1:31:43] they're not preachers but they get an
[1:31:45] inspired word and they speak it out and
[1:31:49] it blesses somebody it encour encourages
[1:31:52] somebody it strengthens somebody and
[1:31:54] that falls under
[1:31:56] tahila and the Psalms are called the
[1:31:59] tahim which is plural so when we read
[1:32:02] the book of Psalms we are reading
[1:32:05] expressive songs that have been inspired
[1:32:09] by the Holy Spirit and sung as praises
[1:32:12] to God but they weren't all sung some of
[1:32:15] them were were were uh sister hope where
[1:32:18] is sister hope she's with the one of the
[1:32:20] children or or maybe both I don't know
[1:32:23] but but sister hope falls under that
[1:32:25] kind of an anointing sometime and she
[1:32:28] writes these poet poems give me the
[1:32:32] official style what's it called say it
[1:32:36] one more time brother
[1:32:39] Josh I shouldn't have any problem
[1:32:41] remembering that spoken word poems are
[1:32:45] portter and she has come and delivered
[1:32:48] them and we have had her to come and
[1:32:50] deliver them and it becomes so heavy in
[1:32:53] the presence of God when we hear those
[1:32:56] words because we know she's not just
[1:32:57] sitting down trying to think of
[1:32:59] something to
[1:33:00] rhyme Sister Williams is a poet sister
[1:33:03] Beverly writes all the time she has
[1:33:06] notebooks and notebooks and I have pages
[1:33:09] and pages and pages of things in my
[1:33:11] files that she has written under the
[1:33:14] inspiration if you ever get a birthday
[1:33:16] card from
[1:33:18] her she writes so little
[1:33:22] so that she can get it all
[1:33:25] in and you know how we cheat you and I
[1:33:27] cheat we get a birthday card and we just
[1:33:29] say love Stephen love brother Shelly not
[1:33:34] sister Beverly she writes a
[1:33:37] Psalm and you know I have read those
[1:33:39] things sometime I've gone back when I
[1:33:42] was low when I needed
[1:33:45] encouragement and I've read a poem that
[1:33:47] Sister Williams wrote or or or some of
[1:33:49] those inspired words that sister be and
[1:33:52] it brings strength to us it brings
[1:33:54] encouragement to one another if we all
[1:33:57] had the same gift then there wouldn't be
[1:33:58] any room for anything else but aren't
[1:34:00] you glad that God has a way of turning
[1:34:03] our
[1:34:04] praise our praise into something that
[1:34:07] falls back on us and can bless the body
[1:34:10] are you with me Psalm 22:3 but Thou Art
[1:34:14] holy oh thou that
[1:34:18] inhabited the
[1:34:19] tahila of Israel
[1:34:22] yeah the spoken and sung Praises of
[1:34:26] Israel in the Amplified version of Psalm
[1:34:30] 22:3 it says but you are holy oh you who
[1:34:34] dwell in the Holy place where the
[1:34:37] Praises of Israel toila the Praises of
[1:34:41] Israel are offered Psalm
[1:34:44] 22:25 my tahila shall be of thee in the
[1:34:49] congregation I will pay my vows before
[1:34:53] them that fear him there are some in our
[1:34:57] ranks who feel like that our praise
[1:35:00] especially if it's expressive praise it
[1:35:03] should take place at home or in the
[1:35:05] privacy of devotion but the Bible is
[1:35:08] clear we don't just praise God in the
[1:35:10] closet come on we don't just praise God
[1:35:13] in the automobile or in the shower when
[1:35:15] we come together in corporate Fellowship
[1:35:18] we come to praise we come to offer
[1:35:23] tahila very much a part of the word amen
[1:35:26] Psalm Psalm uh what is that one 22 uh 25
[1:35:30] Psalm 33:1 rejoice in the Lord oh ye
[1:35:34] righteous for tahila it's
[1:35:39] comely it's pleasing for the upright it
[1:35:44] suits
[1:35:45] you this word comely is an expression
[1:35:48] that says it suits you can I say to you
[1:35:51] folks
[1:35:52] toila the sincere Praise of God in your
[1:35:55] mouth the sincere songs of praise in
[1:35:58] your mou it suits
[1:36:00] you it beautifies you it edifies you
[1:36:05] when I see people entering into that
[1:36:07] kind of sincere praise it's it's like a
[1:36:09] light bulb has turned on behind their
[1:36:11] eyes their faces begin to Glow come on I
[1:36:14] saw some today that I haven't been
[1:36:16] seeing that kind of expression out of I
[1:36:18] saw a few today getting under the
[1:36:20] Overflow that hadn't been getting under
[1:36:21] it and they begin to Worship the Lord
[1:36:23] and they lit up there's been a little
[1:36:26] Shadow over some of you since I met you
[1:36:28] a little Shadow over you but you get in
[1:36:30] the presence of the Lord you start
[1:36:32] sincerely connecting with him and you
[1:36:34] forget about what's going on around you
[1:36:37] and he beautifies you he he he magnify
[1:36:40] it's that shine it's that Hal that we
[1:36:43] talked about you begin to shine when you
[1:36:45] sincerely praise the Lord Psalm 35:28 we
[1:36:49] got to move Psalm 3528 and my tongue
[1:36:52] shall speak of thy righteousness and of
[1:36:54] thy tahila all the day long remember we
[1:37:00] just read the scripture where where
[1:37:01] David said I pray three times a day but
[1:37:03] I praise seven times a day you and I
[1:37:07] should get to the place where we're
[1:37:08] praising twice as long as we're praying
[1:37:11] and we might see a revolution we might
[1:37:13] see more of our needs being met perhaps
[1:37:17] number seven you're a little quiet this
[1:37:19] morning come on come on
[1:37:23] shabbach this is the seventh Hebrew word
[1:37:27] that we are sharing concerning praise
[1:37:30] there there's about
[1:37:32] 29 we're not going to do them
[1:37:35] all I'm telling you that because I want
[1:37:37] you to know the book is full of
[1:37:41] Praise you're overemphasizing praise
[1:37:43] then the Bible did right just following
[1:37:46] in this this word shabbach is it only
[1:37:49] appears 11 times in the Old Testament so
[1:37:51] it must not be so special huh no it is
[1:37:54] it is special it means to L it means to
[1:37:57] praise it means to commend it means to
[1:38:01] congratulate shabbach it is a primitive
[1:38:04] root word that means to properly
[1:38:10] address have you noticed how many of
[1:38:13] these Hebrew words for praise mention
[1:38:15] the
[1:38:16] volume yes sir you think it's okay to
[1:38:19] whisper your praise I do I do I believe
[1:38:22] you can speak to God in a quiet tone I
[1:38:24] absolutely do but I stand amazed that so
[1:38:27] many of the Hebrew words translated as
[1:38:30] praise or to Rejoice are words that
[1:38:32] mention the volume amen why do you think
[1:38:35] that
[1:38:38] is why do you think God wants you to
[1:38:40] praise Him
[1:38:42] loudly
[1:38:43] huh he wants you to give your all he
[1:38:46] also wants you to defeat the
[1:38:48] intimidating
[1:38:49] Devils that try to shut your mouth up
[1:38:53] that try to make you be timid somebody
[1:38:56] said I'm too bashful I'm too shy I I'm
[1:38:58] too introverted I'm to this and I'm to
[1:39:01] that God wants you to overcome some of
[1:39:04] that I tell you there are praise the
[1:39:06] Lords and Hallelujah that are locked up
[1:39:08] in some of you and if you were to let
[1:39:10] them out today there's no telling what
[1:39:13] God could do in your life don't you be
[1:39:15] afraid to praise the Lord you're in a
[1:39:18] safe environment when you come into this
[1:39:20] house we believe that it's vitally
[1:39:22] important in this hour it it means to to
[1:39:26] address in a loud tone figuratively to
[1:39:30] to pacify as if by
[1:39:33] words to commend to glory to keep in
[1:39:39] Praise still to Triumph doesn't that
[1:39:44] sound good to praise to comment
[1:39:49] adoration towards the the Power Glory
[1:39:52] and sanctity of the Lord this is all
[1:39:55] coming from the Hebrew to praise God for
[1:39:57] his mighty act and deeds somebody read
[1:40:01] the last
[1:40:05] part no wonder the Bible said clap your
[1:40:08] hands all you
[1:40:09] people shout unto God I was reading
[1:40:13] where one Hebrew scholar said this is
[1:40:16] more like a war cry than a church anthem
[1:40:21] he said when you read the word shabbach
[1:40:24] you're reading about a war cry that's
[1:40:27] boiling up in the sons of
[1:40:29] God I'm hearing some of that out of
[1:40:32] you the Bible said in Psalm 471 oh clap
[1:40:36] your hands all ye people
[1:40:39] shabach shout unto God with the voice
[1:40:44] of Psalm
[1:40:45] 1171 oh praise halel the Lord all ye
[1:40:51] nations praise shabbach him all ye
[1:40:56] peopleall so do you you know how I could
[1:40:58] translate that shout and
[1:41:01] shine shine and Shout halel means shine
[1:41:05] shabbach means shout so you get it right
[1:41:08] there together Psalm 14712 praise
[1:41:11] shabach the Lord oh Jerusalem praise
[1:41:15] halel thy God o Zion Psalm 145 verses
[1:41:21] four and five one generation shall
[1:41:24] shabach thy Works to
[1:41:29] another do you know how powerful it is
[1:41:31] when grandmothers and grandfathers will
[1:41:34] lead in
[1:41:35] Praise have you seen some of that around
[1:41:38] here we thank God for the
[1:41:40] multi-generational
[1:41:42] praisers how many of you enjoyed
[1:41:44] watching some of these little children
[1:41:45] out in this aisle last night amen it
[1:41:49] goes all the way up to 85 86 87 888 and
[1:41:53] then all the way down to the little ones
[1:41:56] I watched one of the brothers here with
[1:41:58] a little baby in his arm last night and
[1:42:00] the baby clapping her hands because
[1:42:02] everybody why she don't know what she
[1:42:03] means she may not but God knows what she
[1:42:06] means you get in an atmosphere like that
[1:42:09] it's
[1:42:11] contagious it'll make a dead man want to
[1:42:13] come back to
[1:42:14] life it absolutely
[1:42:17] will
[1:42:18] now we're going to get a little
[1:42:20] technical here are you ready number
[1:42:24] eight
[1:42:29] Gil
[1:42:31] Gil it's spelled
[1:42:33] ghou but it's pronounced Gil for you who
[1:42:37] will write this down it's strongs 50
[1:42:41] 1523 and
[1:42:43] 1524 it appears 40 time 45 times in the
[1:42:48] Old Testament its definition
[1:42:51] means to cry out to Rejoice like all the
[1:42:56] other words that are translated praise
[1:42:59] but I'd like for you to look carefully
[1:43:00] at this one a
[1:43:03] circle what about a word that means
[1:43:08] Circle also
[1:43:15] to did you see that
[1:43:18] girl spinning around
[1:43:22] there that couldn't be in
[1:43:26] order it was in The Book of
[1:43:29] Psalms nobody believes in modesty any
[1:43:32] more than I do I believe dresses are
[1:43:35] getting too short I believe skirts are
[1:43:37] getting too
[1:43:40] tight I believe we've got to hold this
[1:43:42] standard no matter what happen not
[1:43:44] because it brings us
[1:43:45] salvation there's no salvation in that
[1:43:48] that's right it's not how you do your
[1:43:50] hair that brings you salvation we are
[1:43:52] not saved by works lest any man should
[1:43:54] boast it is the gift of God but we have
[1:43:57] been called by the Holy Spirit to be an
[1:43:59] example to a dead Dying World around us
[1:44:02] and we have been called he said come out
[1:44:04] of her amen come out of her and be
[1:44:09] separate sayeth the Lord so I I'm I'm
[1:44:13] not talking about uh conducting your
[1:44:15] I've been in conferences I've spoke in
[1:44:18] big charismatic Pentecostal conferences
[1:44:21] where you had to you had to look
[1:44:24] away because the people are not dressed
[1:44:26] properly when they
[1:44:28] praise and I don't believe God's pleased
[1:44:31] with that I'll just be honest but I
[1:44:34] don't want anybody staring at somebody
[1:44:37] when they get under the inspiration
[1:44:40] anyway if you see somebody spinning and
[1:44:42] you don't understand it now you got a
[1:44:44] word to look up and study a circle in in
[1:44:48] Hebrew in in among the Jews there's a
[1:44:51] dance called the
[1:44:52] horror and it's a dance that's done in a
[1:44:55] circle and where did they get such an
[1:44:57] idea like that the word from the
[1:45:04] word Josiah and and Jennifer they they
[1:45:08] gave us a chance at their wedding
[1:45:11] reception to play a little Hebrew music
[1:45:13] and and do a little Hebrew dance and and
[1:45:16] some people are
[1:45:19] appalled
[1:45:21] silliest thing I've ever seen it's in
[1:45:24] the book
[1:45:26] folks dancing is in the book Dancing in
[1:45:29] a circle is in the book spinning while
[1:45:32] you dance is in the book God's not
[1:45:34] calling you to be a ballerina but God's
[1:45:36] calling you to worship Him in spirit and
[1:45:39] in truth come on Under the
[1:45:43] Influence come
[1:45:45] on on under the influence of any violent
[1:45:49] emotion
[1:45:51] or by
[1:45:53] permutation also gou which is a
[1:45:56] derivative from the Primitive word and
[1:45:59] it is usually translated Rejoice or Joy
[1:46:02] or joyful so there are times in the
[1:46:06] Bible that you will find the word
[1:46:09] rejoice and it doesn't just mean
[1:46:13] praise it means to move in a circle yes
[1:46:18] amen I'm not trying to introduce some
[1:46:20] new doctorine I'm just trying to give
[1:46:22] you what the book said right some of you
[1:46:24] are looking at me like I've just F fell
[1:46:25] off the turnup truck or something and
[1:46:28] you're wondering why we I Wonder too
[1:46:30] I'll be honest with you I wonder why
[1:46:33] after all these years we have to go back
[1:46:35] to the Bible and teach people come on
[1:46:39] that it's all right to
[1:46:43] praise what a shame that's right what a
[1:46:46] shame that we have to speak to our our
[1:46:48] our friends and our neighbors out there
[1:46:50] a a and other church folks that we know
[1:46:53] and we have to to nearly defend I'm not
[1:46:55] going to defend but I will take a moment
[1:46:57] to
[1:46:58] teach I'm not going to defend the way we
[1:47:01] praise I'm not going to defend the way
[1:47:03] we carry on but I am going to show you
[1:47:05] that it is according to the
[1:47:08] word and anybody that is opposed to that
[1:47:11] is simply a control
[1:47:18] freak ministers as as much as we love
[1:47:21] them and pray for them if they won't
[1:47:23] allow the people to have Liberty it's
[1:47:25] because they are afraid of losing
[1:47:29] control we need the Holy Ghost to come
[1:47:33] and take control of the body of
[1:47:37] [Applause]
[1:47:39] Christ somebody said the word and I must
[1:47:42] take prance the word is the most
[1:47:43] important thing I believe that too
[1:47:45] that's why we worship an hour and preach
[1:47:47] for
[1:47:49] two
[1:47:51] come
[1:47:52] on violent
[1:47:54] emotion I looked up there and that man
[1:47:57] was kind of jerking like he was mad and
[1:48:00] I just don't know if there's anything to
[1:48:01] that look you don't know what you're
[1:48:02] going to do I pray that you that are
[1:48:05] sitting in the seat of the scornful I
[1:48:07] pray that when God falls on
[1:48:14] you I'm going to go tell your mama I'm
[1:48:16] going to tell your daddy I'm going to go
[1:48:18] tell your former pastors
[1:48:20] yeah when the spirit of God falls on you
[1:48:23] I'm going to tell them how you act
[1:48:26] because you don't know what you're going
[1:48:27] to do until that thing falls on you

[1:55:18] them but I have to get over
[1:55:20] that why don't some of you children and
[1:55:23] young people so easily embarrassed why
[1:55:25] don't you look up there and see your
[1:55:27] mother who's labored for you who's
[1:55:31] drugged you through who's prayed you
[1:55:33] through why don't you look up there and
[1:55:35] see your mama praising God and let it
[1:55:37] bring great joy to your
[1:55:39] [Applause]
[1:55:41] heart I don't want my children to be
[1:55:43] embarrassed and if they tell me they are
[1:55:45] you ain't seen nothing
[1:55:47] yet if my praise embarrassed is you now
[1:55:50] I'm looking for some Wilder
[1:55:52] praise I want to praise him until you
[1:55:55] can rejoice in it these people are
[1:55:58] rejoicing as through wine You observe
[1:56:01] them and they look like they become
[1:56:03] intoxicated and brother brandom explain
[1:56:05] that to us it is the
[1:56:10] stimulation of
[1:56:14] Revelation yes sir sir when you know
[1:56:17] that you know that you know that you
[1:56:19] know
[1:56:20] that you have heard God's
[1:56:22] word when you know that you know that
[1:56:25] you know that you're a Son of God it'll
[1:56:28] bring a stimulation when you know that
[1:56:30] you've received the revelation of Jesus
[1:56:32] Christ for our day it'll bring a
[1:56:34] stimulation oh
[1:56:37] yes you won't act like a Methodist
[1:56:40] then nothing wrong with the Methodist
[1:56:43] but you won't act like that you won't
[1:56:44] you won't act like the Episcopalian then
[1:56:46] nothing wrong the Episcopalian but you
[1:56:48] won't act like that then
[1:56:50] you'll act like somebody that's got a
[1:56:51] hold of
[1:56:54] something Zephaniah
[1:56:57] 3:17 this is so beautiful to me I hope
[1:57:00] you catch the beauty of this one the
[1:57:03] Lord thy God in the midst of thee is
[1:57:07] mighty somebody say you're mighty
[1:57:10] Lord he
[1:57:12] will he
[1:57:18] will
[1:57:21] he will rejoice over
[1:57:24] thee here you are rejoicing over
[1:57:29] him here you've come to give God
[1:57:32] praise and to bring him joy and look at
[1:57:35] what Zephaniah said I caught the Lord I
[1:57:39] caught a glimpse of the Lord and he was
[1:57:42] rejoicing over
[1:57:47] you amen with
[1:57:55] joy he will rest in his
[1:57:59] love he will
[1:58:03] Gil the first Joy is not the second Joy
[1:58:07] he will Gil over
[1:58:13] thee with
[1:58:18] singing
[1:58:20] folks you've never you you you've never
[1:58:22] realized
[1:58:24] perhaps that the Lord sings over his
[1:58:28] people and he rejoices over his people
[1:58:31] and he spins over his
[1:58:33] people and I believe with all of my
[1:58:36] heart that there are times when that
[1:58:37] anointing and that atmosphere shifts and
[1:58:40] you see people beginning to do things
[1:58:42] they don't
[1:58:43] understand maybe moving their arms like
[1:58:46] this or doing something that looks so so
[1:58:48] out of the ordin AR and so strange and
[1:58:50] so weird to you I honestly believe
[1:58:52] sometime that they're picking
[1:58:54] up that they're sensing by the spirit
[1:58:57] the movement that's happening over their
[1:58:59] heads as both the angels of the Lord and
[1:59:02] the Lord God himself Rejoice over his
[1:59:05] people with joy with moving in a
[1:59:08] circular motion he sings over us yes
[1:59:12] Lord wouldn't we want to
[1:59:14] reciprocate wouldn't we want to Rejoice
[1:59:16] over him wouldn't we want to sing over
[1:59:19] for him and give him
[1:59:21] praise and we come to the last one
[1:59:25] nine
[1:59:28] malol it's strongs
[1:59:32] 4234 it's derived from strongs
[1:59:37] 2342 it means
[1:59:40] dance
[1:59:41] dancing this word appear six times in
[1:59:45] the Old Testament and the definition is
[1:59:47] a round dance dancing to dance in a
[1:59:51] circle or to whirl about by turning do
[1:59:55] you see how similar these two words are
[1:59:58] and yet somehow the translators believe
[2:00:01] that they were different enough that
[2:00:04] there had to be another word there had
[2:00:06] to be something that would add to it
[2:00:09] there was some
[2:00:10] reason for for for the Hebrew writer
[2:00:14] choosing two different words in Psalm
[2:00:17] 30: 11 and well thou Hast turned for me
[2:00:21] listen at these just listen at the theme
[2:00:23] of these of these verses there's six of
[2:00:25] them I'm going to read five quickly thou
[2:00:28] Hast turned for me
[2:00:31] my Let Me Hear You morning into
[2:00:35] dancing thou Hast put off
[2:00:38] my and girded me with
[2:00:43] gladness come on brother Amos this is
[2:00:47] you this is you
[2:00:50] you don't have to be you don't have to
[2:00:51] feel embarrassed because God is giving
[2:00:54] you peace and God is giving you he he
[2:00:58] said to me and I don't mean to embarrass
[2:01:00] him in any way he's my brother my
[2:01:03] friend he said to me yesterday I feel
[2:01:05] like I know you through the stream and
[2:01:07] standing there with him I felt the same
[2:01:10] way and we mention again only for the
[2:01:13] sake of this that he's just recently
[2:01:15] buried his wife he's here with nine
[2:01:18] children and he he said I did my
[2:01:20] grieving in those days when she was
[2:01:23] suffering but he said there was almost
[2:01:25] like a release that happened and you
[2:01:28] feel a little embarrassed by that I said
[2:01:30] to him I really know I don't know the
[2:01:33] same kind of suffering but I know that I
[2:01:36] did my grieving for my mother when her
[2:01:39] mind left me and and when she when her
[2:01:42] body finally left here I was so thrilled
[2:01:45] and so happy that she was released from
[2:01:48] her suffering and was in her right mind
[2:01:51] and in a new body and and so if if any
[2:01:55] of us can can squeeze a praise out of
[2:01:58] our sorrow if any of us can choose to
[2:02:01] glorify God even when we've been through
[2:02:03] a painful time this is the reason why
[2:02:06] because it is God who turns our
[2:02:10] morning into
[2:02:13] dancing it's him that takes off the
[2:02:15] sackcloth of
[2:02:17] grief and GS us with his gladness I'm
[2:02:23] tired of Christian people looking like
[2:02:25] they're sucking on
[2:02:27] pemons I'm tired of people who believe
[2:02:30] this message acting like they've lost
[2:02:32] their best
[2:02:33] friend never taking a chance to give God
[2:02:37] glory let's do his name don't you be
[2:02:40] guilty of such a behavior is that you
[2:02:43] give him
[2:02:44] praise I hope you'll give the deacons
[2:02:47] trouble
[2:02:58] woo reminds me of that old song Shirley
[2:03:01] Caesar used to sing hold my
[2:03:05] mule they got tired of that old colored
[2:03:08] man disturbing the
[2:03:13] service it wasn't like this church where
[2:03:15] everybody's praising but he was the only
[2:03:18] one and he he'd praise when they're
[2:03:20] praising and he'd praise when they
[2:03:21] weren't praising he'd praise when
[2:03:22] they're singing he'd praise when they're
[2:03:24] preaching he couldn't help himself he'd
[2:03:25] just jump up and do a little
[2:03:28] dance and one day he's out in the in the
[2:03:31] field plowing the
[2:03:33] mule and the and the Cadillac rides up
[2:03:37] and the deacons get out and they find
[2:03:39] him there he stops the mule and they
[2:03:41] begin to talk to him and they say
[2:03:43] brother we have come to talk to
[2:03:47] you we we can't have no none of this in
[2:03:49] our
[2:03:51] church we have a dignified
[2:03:54] church we want to have a church that the
[2:03:56] mayor can come
[2:03:58] to we want to have a church that the
[2:04:00] dignitaries can come to and we don't
[2:04:02] want to embarrass them by the way we
[2:04:04] carry on so you're going to have to calm
[2:04:07] down in our church your praise is
[2:04:11] disturbing
[2:04:13] people and and we don't know why you
[2:04:15] have to be so out of the way and he said
[2:04:17] you just don't know what the Lord has
[2:04:19] done for
[2:04:20] me you must not understand what the Lord
[2:04:23] has done for me he said I don't want to
[2:04:25] disturb your church right I don't mean
[2:04:28] to disturb your service and about that
[2:04:31] time it falls on
[2:04:33] him and he turns to one of the
[2:04:36] deacons and he says hold my
[2:04:42] mu if I can't jump in your church I'll
[2:04:45] jump in my
[2:04:47] field if I can't praise God in your
[2:04:49] church I'll praise God in my
[2:04:52] house
[2:04:54] Hallelujah sometimes we have to be that
[2:04:59] determined nothing or no one or no
[2:05:03] circumstance is going to quench Our
[2:05:05] Praise
[2:05:07] woo
[2:05:09] Hallelujah let them let me go on thou
[2:05:13] has turned for me my morning into
[2:05:15] dancing
[2:05:17] my that has put off my sackcloth and
[2:05:20] girded me with gladness to the end to
[2:05:23] the
[2:05:24] end that my
[2:05:26] glory may sing praise to thee do you
[2:05:30] hear what he's saying he's saying you
[2:05:33] took my
[2:05:35] sorrow you turned my mour to dancing you
[2:05:40] replaced my sackcloth with the with the
[2:05:44] with the clothes of of of gladness so
[2:05:48] that so that to the end my glory may
[2:05:54] sing praise to thee and and
[2:06:02] and not be
[2:06:07] silent oh Lord my God I will give thanks
[2:06:11] unto thee
[2:06:13] forever Psalm 1493 let them praise His
[2:06:16] name in the
[2:06:22] myle I will when the spirit of the Lord
[2:06:25] hits me I didn't read that there I come
[2:06:28] out of Pentecost the Pentecostal church
[2:06:30] I come out of the Holiness Church I know
[2:06:33] exactly how they taught
[2:06:34] it you don't do anything till it hits
[2:06:39] you well it's been so long since it hit
[2:06:42] anybody around here seems like sometime
[2:06:44] that if we waited on it to hit us we'd
[2:06:47] never get involved
[2:06:51] there's nothing in this Bible that tells
[2:06:54] us you must wait for the Lord to fall on
[2:06:57] you before you praise Him amen there's
[2:07:01] nothing in this Bible that says you got
[2:07:03] to feel like it before you praise him
[2:07:07] there's nothing that says he has to to
[2:07:10] to uh wrestle you out of your Pew and
[2:07:14] force your feet to dance so that you'll
[2:07:17] dance before for him no Bible for that
[2:07:20] whatsoever I don't know where we get
[2:07:22] such an idea here's what the Bible said
[2:07:25] let them praise His
[2:07:30] name
[2:07:34] mle praise him with stringed
[2:07:37] instruments and
[2:07:39] organs Jeremiah
[2:07:41] 31:4 again I will build thee listen
[2:07:43] these are beautiful verses this is
[2:07:45] prophetic to to the to the reestablish
[2:07:48] Ling of the of the Covenant of God with
[2:07:50] the Jewish people in the land of Israel
[2:07:52] but you can claim your promises a part
[2:07:54] of that grafted in uh one new man he
[2:07:59] said again I will build thee and thou
[2:08:01] shalt be built oh Virgin of Israel Thou
[2:08:04] shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets
[2:08:07] and shall go forth in the dances M of
[2:08:11] them that make Mary and then in verse 13
[2:08:14] and 14 of the same chapter then shall
[2:08:17] the virgin virgin rejoice in the M dance
[2:08:23] both young
[2:08:31] men that's me and you I represent the
[2:08:34] old
[2:08:37] man together for I will turn their
[2:08:42] mourning yeah into joy and Will Comfort
[2:08:47] them

[2:08:50] them Rejoice from their
[2:08:55] sorrow listen to this and I will satate
[2:08:59] the
[2:09:02] soul of the priest with
[2:09:06] fatness and my people shall be satisfied
[2:09:10] with my
[2:09:11] goodness sayeth the Lord in what hour in
[2:09:16] the hour that their morning is turned to
[2:09:18] dancing would you let
[2:09:21] God would you let God turn your sorrow
[2:09:24] into praise would you let God loose you
[2:09:28] from the things that bind you or hold
[2:09:30] you I want the musicians to come I know
[2:09:32] some of you going to fall right off of
[2:09:33] your
[2:09:40] seat when has your pastor ever closed a
[2:09:43] service at 1:00 we're not closing the
[2:09:46] service just the sermon
[2:09:50] yeah I saw the Spirit of the Lord moving
[2:09:53] over this house this morning and I saw
[2:09:56] God ministering to to people's needs
[2:09:59] without a prayer line without oil being
[2:10:01] put on their forehead without the elders
[2:10:03] coming to pray for them because there
[2:10:05] was an atmosphere created that was
[2:10:08] contagious and I want you to to lean
[2:10:11] into that just a moment as they come and
[2:10:13] we're going to spend a little more time
[2:10:15] worshiping the Lord together today and
[2:10:18] understanding I want you to understand
[2:10:20] that if we
[2:10:21] summarize these nine
[2:10:24] words we shall see that praise
[2:10:28] originates from a heart of
[2:10:30] humility
[2:10:32] Barack the Bowing of the knee from a
[2:10:36] Heart of Thanksgiving
[2:10:39] toah praise acknowledges God's character
[2:10:43] and his mighty Works
[2:10:46] yadada pray prise declares both to God
[2:10:50] and to others his Renown his Fame his
[2:10:55] glory to
[2:10:56] heila praise is at times
[2:11:00] loud at times boisterous at times
[2:11:06] celebrative celebrative
[2:11:09] shabbach in addition praise is often
[2:11:12] voiced through singing and music Zar
[2:11:17] yeah when we summarize these Hebrew
[2:11:20] words a definition of Praise begins to
[2:11:24] form and here it is praise
[2:11:29] commends
[2:11:31] extols or magnifies God from a thankful
[2:11:35] heart for his character attributes Works
[2:11:40] ways Fame and Glory either directly to
[2:11:45] God or indirectly to others through word
[2:11:48] singing instruments and other
[2:11:51] demonstrations of celebrations
[2:11:54] these nine words speak to us of a people
[2:12:00] who are committed to lifting up the name
[2:12:03] of our God to hallowing his name and
[2:12:07] making it holy among the heathens in the
[2:12:10] darkness of the world that we're living
[2:12:11] in today it speaks of a people who are
[2:12:14] not ashamed to be called his own it
[2:12:18] speaks of a people who are are willing
[2:12:20] to In Spite of in spite of difficulty in
[2:12:26] spite of
[2:12:27] persecution in spite of heartbreak or
[2:12:30] heartache they're determined to make
[2:12:32] sure that God knows how much we

[2:56:38] go along I felt like it would be good if
[2:56:40] I go help and so it so worked out they

[2:57:09] weekend and we've heard so much Lord
[2:57:11] about praise and even seeing in the
[2:57:14] scripture all the different
[2:57:17] ways that scripture to praise you hallu
[2:57:21] and Lord that just rejoices my heart yes
[2:57:25] when we see all that in scripture we've
[2:57:27] experienced some of it maybe Lord and
[2:57:29] didn't know it was all exactly that way
