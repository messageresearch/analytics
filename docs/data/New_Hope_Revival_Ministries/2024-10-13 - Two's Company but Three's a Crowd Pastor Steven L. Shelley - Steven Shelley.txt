========================================

Description:
In this powerful message, Pastor Steven L. Shelley delves into the Old Testament story of Abraham, Isaac, and Rebecca to illustrate the importance of prioritizing Christ above all else in the life of a believer. Just as Eleazar, the faithful servant, was sent to find a bride for Isaac, the Holy Spirit guides and prepares believers to enter into an intimate relationship with their Bridegroom, Jesus Christ.

Pastor Shelley emphasizes the need for discernment, urging believers to test all teachings and experiences against the absolute authority of scripture. He cautions against excessive focus on messengers or prophets, reminding listeners that Christ alone should be the central focus and ultimate authority in their lives.

This message is a call to make a decisive commitment to Christ, leaving behind anything that hinders a personal relationship with Him. Pastor Shelley encourages believers to separate themselves from the world and live a life that reflects Christ's teachings, cultivating a deep and abiding love for Him.

Key Points:

Christ's Preeminence: Christ should be the central focus of the Church, above any pastor, worship leader, or prophet.
The Role of the Holy Spirit: The Holy Spirit guides and prepares believers for Christ, similar to how Eleazar guided Rebecca to Isaac.
Discernment and Scriptural Alignment: All teachings, experiences, and revelations should be tested against the scripture.
Decisive Commitment: Believers are urged to make a decisive commitment to Christ, leaving behind anything that hinders their relationship with Him.
Separation from the World: The Bride of Christ is called to be separated from the world and live a life that reflects His teachings.
Intimate Relationship with Christ: The ultimate goal is a personal and intimate relationship with Christ, where He is the sole focus.

"And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence." Colossians 1:...

your hand all over the house there are needs out across the Stream I know that there are needs we want to remember camp meeting this week as people are traveling we want to ask the Lord to protect them we want the atmosphere over the campground to be just right we want to let it be a welcome place for the angels of the Lord to roam around we want a clean and clear atmosphere so we want to do our part to make sure that the atmosphere is kept Clean and Clear for the presence of God to come Among Us in a profound way way as the as the worship would go uh out of here and the ministry of the word that God can do what he wants to do Among Us this weeken we want to remember again to pray for the nation of Israel there's a lot of things going on that we need to continue to stand in the Gap and believe God to strengthen her there is the possibility of an incursion ground incursion into Syria that's being reported there are things happening all around the region on seven different fronts even the houthis this week have said we're going to bring in a allout naval war against Israel I don't think they want to do that but maybe they haven't got the message yet would you pray for the Believers there would you pray for God's people that he will shield them and protect them and keep them would you pray for John richer uh you know everyone here all of the home folk know him his grandparents were brother and sister train who served the Lord here for so many years and Bob and hope uh hope her their daughter is John's mother and they were married here and for some time raised their children here anyway John uh has been going through a lot of things there's been a divorce in their family and he's not maybe taking his medication like he should I don't know all the the details but he had an epileptic seizure at work he works for FedEx if I understand it right he went off the forklift and way down onto the loading to the bottom of the loading floor broke his face a brain bleed and and so forth but God has has already moved for him he's still in intensive care he's still intubated uh he's still under you know they're keeping him under because when he started waking up he was quite restless and actually had another seizure so they put him back down again last night hope told me that uh he has an infection now and that they are starting him on very serious rounds of antibiotics Etc to try to bring that down they're going to do an MRI Monday if if uh he remains stable enough to do it to find out if there's something else going on there there there is still a question about how what kind of condition he would be in if he comes through this uh when when they asked them the night when Amanda who who went to the hospital uh and met them there still his whatever you call Medical power of attorney or next of Ken when she asked them can you survive this they would look her in the eye but God has certainly shown him Mercy I can't get him off my mind he's away from God but he has known the Lord and he has known the truth and I want to see God reach down in that hospital and and talk to his heart and and see what God can do with his life just pray for the whole family it's a it's an awkward situation with a split like that and the kids of course they're concerned about their dad and and uh the family is here with John's sister and so forth I know I'm taking a lot of time but these are people that have meant so so much to us let's ask the Lord's perfect will to be done uh block every every attack of the enemy and what Satan would try to do to pull the this timing of the Lord into another Direction I want to see John set free and serving the lord and I want to see his family uh growing in the things of God so pray for them would you pray

here concerning I a month ago over a month ago I ordered the the vanity tops for down at the fellowship hall and when the order was placed I was told they would be ready in two weeks we're over a month and I went Friday and they made a call and I was told that I would not see them until November the 5th they're still in production well I wished I could produce them myself but I can't and so I'll just have to wait I'm asking the Lord to let him arrive this week he can do that for me for us yesterday Nathan saw a yard sale down our street and he sent me a picture and so later in the day I went to the yard sale and they had a vanity and I you know the wheels turned and so I thought well at least there could be uh a sink to wash hands in one of the bathrooms just a temporary thing it had a faucet on it and I said I can make that work so I went up and I handed the lady $10 and she says well what did it have on it I said $10 and she says you're not paying $10 for that and she looked at her husband and she says give him 8 back $2 okay so so the man helped me load it and he walked away and in a second here she comes and she says what did he charge you for that I said well you told him $2 so that's what I paid she says here's your $2 back so I didn't pay anything for [Applause] it so one of the bathrooms will have a vanity if by chance you have a sink bowl that is in your shed that you are not using that I could cut a hole in a piece of plywood and put a faucet on I would invite you to bring it to me I can make it work temporarily until we get the good ones it won't look as as I wanted it to but at least it'll be functioning that we you can wash your hands after you use the bathroom the the both bathrooms now have a a a commode in them so they are now usable and we're very happy that we can tell the the ouse byby and uh we can have working facilities in the fellowship hall we are gearing up for a wonderful week and so we want to give we know that all you ladies are going to be giving of yourself this week in in the preparing of the food and I just want to say as one of the ministers here may the Lord bless you with strength like you have not experienced for a long long time uh clearness of mind with your recipes so that there won't be any mess ups that'll just go smoothly for you so that we you won't feel that agitation uh of something like that to cause your you know another battle may God just bless you with clear mind to be able to fix the food that you must but we're going to invite you to give your tithe and your offering today uh there's expenses of the camp meeting and and we could go through them but we're not going to take that time just ask the Lord how he would want you to give with your finances and whatever else this week and I

coming and spending the day with us today Colossians chapter 1 verse 17 and 18 it's in these verses of scripture that our theme for camp meeting 2024 is found it's actually found in Colossians 1:1 188b and when you see that a or a B there it means either the first part of the verse or the second part of the verse and so it would actually read the the address would actually be Colossians 1:18 B and it says that in all things listen that in all things he might have the preeminence that's the theme for the 2024 camp meeting that in all things he might have the preeminence reading verse 17 and 18 together it says and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church do you believe that who is the beginning the first born from the dead he's not the last he's not the ending he's the beginning of those who will arise from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence we are in the hour where Christ the word must have the preeminence in all things we do not our pastor come on now not our worship leader not even a prophet but he must have the preeminence brother brandom always pluralized preeminence almost every time he would say he must have the has the preeminence let the activities of the church project declare manifest that he has the preeminence and let the preaching of the word yes make sure above all things that Jesus and the Living Word somebody said well you said Jesus have the prein and you said the word don't we understand what John told us in the beginning beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh and so this word is not talking about a group of sermons only it's talking about that which came forth from the logos it came forth as Rama to the body of Christ a living spontaneous nabba word that's Hebrew for bubbling forth it was a bubbling forth word of sure prophecy for us and we're thankful for it it cannot stand alone let me make sure as we enter this camp meeting that you know that I believe that the message that God entrusted to brother brandham cannot stand by itself it was not designed to stand alone it must be laid on the absolute scripture because as he is teaching and preaching it to us he says over and over again that that word that word is the absolute he's always referring us back now we know and I know you're standing but we know today that the Bible itself is only a written record of a Living Word but we honor that above all and God protected it down through the years and men gave their lives to give us this Holy Scripture and so if you should come in contact with with anything above or beyond that make sure you understand that every dream and every vision and every gift and every feeling and every leading and every sensation and every inspiration must come back and lay upon the foundation of the absoluteness of the scripture and if you have an in spiration a vision a dream a word or you hear a sermon that cannot completely lie in the absolute foundation of the scripture you have an obligation as a holy ghost Christian not to condemn it but to lay it aside that's your job not to be critical but to just lay it aside and I believe that we can find enough even in this message of the hour as we call it which brother brandham when he's describing the message of the hour he calls it the whole Bible right the whole book that's what he refers to as the message but we have come to call it something else but remember that Revelation is Progressive sir and understand that if we take what we hear on those tapes we must take it as it lines up yes sir we're not Catholics no sir we don't believe in the in ereny of a pope or a prophet we believe that prophets are men God designed it that way we're thankful that we have an Earthly Angel who comes to speak on behalf of a Heavenly Angel he became the mouthpiece but I'm going to tell you something something's wrong around our ranks in this hour because we're not seeing in this hour what the scriptures have have presented as the right pattern the right pattern is let the forerunning messenger decrease so that he might have the preeminence among us and what we see happening as as uh so many are pulling away it has caused a chain reaction that causes uh ministers to bring people back uh constantly makes such an effort to bring people back to the messenger and I understand the need to do that always uh you know uh hanging on to pictures and and and I I I totally understand the need for that but please remember that Christ is to be glorified Among Us he is to be lifted up to the highest place he is to have full preeminence in the church and if you don't believe that's according to the message of the hour go home today and listen to the message that Christ is the mystery of God revealed three things God wanted to do in revealing Christ and uh get a hold of that and let that be your anchor in these uncertain times one more place of scripture if you don't mind Leviticus chapter 20 and I don't make any apology for that in fact I intend to say it even uh uh Bolder before I'm done l US 20: 23 and ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation which I cast out before you for they committed all these things and therefore I abhor them remember the word abhor the strongest degree of hate God said I hated the way these people lived sir I hated it but I have said unto you ye shall inherit their land and I will give it unto you to possess it a land that floweth with milk and honey I am the Lord your God which have separated you from other people do you see that this little bride like Israel is to be a separated people unto the Lord unto the word ye shall therefore put difference between clean be yeast and unclean yes sir and between unclean fowls and clean and ye shall not make your souls abominable did I get it out abominable by Beast or by foul or by any manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground which I have separated from you as unclean now I just want to make one reference here and move quickly on before the bacon lovers get stirred you don't want to come against bacon folks you know but I just want to say that the word of God is telling us here that we we have to differentiate between clean and unclean what What's So Pro profound in this verse is that it tells us that that it has effect not only on the belly not only on the lip but it actually has an effect on the mind the will and the emotions yes sir it says Soul so what we eat can evidently have an effect on our mind our will and our emotions let's pray for all the sugar addicts in this place so that's that's established here in the scripture that what you eat can have an effect on your mind your will and your emotions especially an animal that God has said is unclean yes and ye shall be holy unto me for I the Lord why don't you help me read it am Holy and have severed you severed let's say that severed you from other people that you should be M I have cut you off that word severed there means to divide to separate to set apart and the last uh definition of that word in the Hebrew is to make distinction God has set a distinction upon his people sir amen and that means that anybody out there should be able to look at you listen to you spend time with you and know that you are not of this world come on now you are of another dimension you have another home how many of you have another home praise be to God father I thank you today for The Living Word and it is indeed the truth that we've taken a lot of time in preliminaries so we need you to come and help us today your word is already anointed but father we pray that you will send anointing to deliver it and anointing to receive it for the anointing destroyed is the Yoke and it's so easy for us to pick on a yoke uh of something in this life and we need to have that demolished broken destroyed so that we have Liberty to worship you in spirit and in truth and that we have Liberty to serve you a h among others who have paved the way before us we join in that great company of host who have paid the price and made it now God we thank you for the same Grace in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the church said you may be seated please do your best to stay with me because this is a well it's a foundation uh I won't be ministering again as far as I know this week until Saturday night and I'll give part one this morning and and most likely part two on Saturday night so that means you got to have a long memory that means you've got to hold on to this foundation so we have started in Leviticus and we have read these verses of scripture where God is speaking to Israel and he's saying I I've called you out from among the other nations and I have made you clean and I have left them as unclean and I want you to be a separated people uh uh uh separated he says it very clearly from other people I want you to be different I want you to be mine Peter tells us that we are a royal priesthood come on a holy nation now this is a one new man that Hawke was praying about he called it a a one new creation and that's what the scripture said neither Jew nor Gentile but called together under a covenant of God's Great Grace both the natural Seed of Abraham and the Royal spiritual Seed of Abraham we're together in this Covenant amen Gentiles were not an afterthought he had them in his mind from the foundation of the world he said you're going to have to join yourselves to those that I have chosen and you're going to have to submit and surrender to what I have required of them but there's coming a time that I'm going to bring fulfillment and every type and every shadow is going to have fulfillment and a reality and I want you to know when Jesus came he did that brother sister in fact he's still doing it today when I read the Old Testament I see Jesus there if you don't you might ought to rub your eyes and read it again because he's there in the Tabernacle he's there in the garments of the priest he's there in the Holy Temple he's there in the offering system and in the sacrifice system God is there and he's revealing that there's coming an hour like we preached last week when Abraham was about to take the son the life of his only son the angel of the Lord and the voice of Eternity stopped him and and said wait a minute I I have prepared a sacrifice God in essence saying you didn't have to do it but you had to be willing to do it and the Bible said he lifted up his eyes and he saw and that lifting up of his eyes is a Hebrew idiom a Hebrew expression that talks about not just lifting up your eyes and seeing what is a few feet or a few yards away from you but spiritually lifting up your eyes and seeing a future fulfillment because it was right there on Mount Moria on Mount Mariah that our Lord our sacrificial perfect lamb would hang so one ram gave his life life that day as a substitute for Isaac but how many of you are thankful for a bleeding lamb who came God's word made flesh to die for us and we still enter in by grace and we still enter in today by the blood of the Lamb not by your belt buckle on not by the picture you carry in your wallet not by the sign over your door not by saying I believe the message you enter in by the blood of the Lamb because demons believe and tremble you might have to argue with people about whether or not William brandom was a prophet but you'll never have to argue with a demon about it because if he's presenting anything other than that he's just trying to fool you because he knows the plan of God for the end time he knows the economy of God he knows how the revelation of Jesus Christ was to be made real to a little bride in the last days because as Christ is the manifestation of God Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said there would be a bride yes sir a multim membered body that would be the mystery of Christ revealed yes sir he said all that was in the father he poured into the and everything that was in the sun Jesus he poured into his church now brother if that don't excit you then something's wrong like I said Sunday if that doesn't stir your soul your spoons fell out of your bowl you need to get your spoon back because these things that we have heard all so long ago they are more real today than they have ever been we're living in the season of the coming of the Lord he's here right he's here in Bride form already yes sir and one day he's coming to receive a bride he came the first time to do what to redeem the bride he's coming the next time to receive the bride and then we say the second coming which is really a third coming so to speak he comes with the bride he came to Bethlehem yes sir didn't he do it just a little baby in the arms of a mother and a father he came that way to later die on a cross and redeem a bride then he's coming well he doesn't put his feet on the on the Earth but he comes in clouds of Glory he receives a bride unto himself so the Rapture is about Christ receiving his bride out of this world somebody said I don't believe in that doesn't matter what you believe in nobody's asking you what you believe we're just saying what the word said for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven first with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and the last Trump of God and the dead and cry shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together to meet the Lord in the air don't forget the rest of that verse and so shall we ever be with the Lord that is an eternal promise it's not one that H are you with me this morning that's not one that has an expiration date oh do you mind if I take a little water good why don't you take if you've got some why don't you take some with me so I don't feel alone and the rest of you just wished you had some I would say Wet My Whistle but it was more than my whistle that needed some water there so many years ago I preached a sermon that got me kicked out of the ranks so I've been I've been living most of my life uh on the outside of the camp and uh my name no longer appears in the in the in the announcements of big conventions and camp meetings and so forth I'm just a little spoke on the wheel thank God I'm okay with that 100% but I thought if it caused me so much trouble way back when why not revive it oh seems like my I'm gaining more friends so so why not thin them out again F them out again if people get too excited over your ministry and you realize that it got you in trouble one time when people did that then you you you ever now and again have to come and kind of thin out the crowd a little bit so that you don't start thinking more highly of yourself than you should we're just a humble we must be just just claying his hand it's not us so so the name of the sermon that got me in so much trouble was to's [Music] company but three is a Crowd Oh I preach that all over in the 90s and you know it's it's just kind of amazing to me that most people remember me for 12-ft Shuffle and House of hell and one more night with the frogs and I mean I get inboxes on Facebook almost every week speak from people who say I was in your meeting in Michigan in Ohio in Virginia and Arizona and I heard you preach some of those sermons but very few ever mentioned two two stand out one was the image of the Prophet which I preach from the scripture and the message of the hour concerning the fact that brother brandham tells us that the statue that was made in the days of Daniel Shadrach Meshach and Abednego was not likely the image of the King as it has been presented to us but more likely the image of the Prophet so I preached a sermon about the image of the prophet and I preached that there were at least three boys in that crowd that said I love him too much I love him too much that's Daniel that's an image of Daniel I love him too much to bow my knee and worship him as Lord you can only imagine how that stirred the the soup and then this one two is company but three is a crowd how many of you like people let me see your hand some of you aren't being very honest cuz I never see you with anybody I didn't raise my hand because the only struggles I've ever had in life were people it doesn't mean you don't like people particularly but it means that you have to understand that you come to a place where you are slightly peopled out you don't hate people but you've just had a lot of folks and you just pull back a little bit and get your breath and re scriptural scriptural you know Jesus was was up in in Lebanon the southern part of Lebanon trying to get some rest and his disciples were there to make sure he got it and here come a little woman have mercy on me my daughter grievously vexed with the devil and and and he tried to get rid of her but how many of you know there's certain amount of Faith there that you just can't get rid of he tried to insult her and he did a good job he said you know the dogs eat the crumbs if all I I I mean he said it's not meat to take the children's bread the Lord said and cast it to the dog and she didn't say oh like like a 2024 Christian would a 20 24 Christian would say oh I got my feelings hurt I ain't never going back there no more I don't want nothing to do with him he's just a charlatan come on she it was too late to tell her he wasn't real she just kept screaming out even more have mercy on me my daughter's grievously vexed with the devil and when he told her that that uh you know that the healing is the children's bread and doesn't belong to her she said truth Lord but even the little dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table Jesus said I've never seen such faith in Israel I had to get out among the the other other folks to find somebody who would believe but scripturally he was there to take his rest and it's all right sometime to need rest but how and all of you people lovers one more time let me see your hand i'm a people lover I love the crowd David your hand better be up you it better be up because I don't know anybody that plans more things they don't all come together because obviously you love to be together with a lot of other people more than they want to be together with other people he's always trying to make a party I mean really he always wants to make a party but here's the reality there must be a time David there has to be a time that you are especially coming from a huge family like yours that you are just a little slightly peopled out is that ever happened Ashley to David does he ever oh she's not sure David slowly shakes his head ask I don't know should I ask you Ashley are there times that that David's desire to be with everybody all the time does it kind of people you out sometime praise the Lord for Pure honesty there comes a time that you that that two become company companions and to add to the [Music] mix there's just a time let me let me say this to you I'm going to say this I'm going to be embarrassed to say it and then I'm going to get in trouble for saying it and then I won't say it for a while and then I'm going to say it again but I'll never forget it we're leaving the wedding my wedding and we have rented a big old limousine you know where I'm going don't you and I thought the purpose of renting that big old limousine was to bring the bridal party to the reception isn't that what you thought it would be about I mean why do you need that big old vehicle just to take you and your newly married wife over to the over to the oh it's getting quiet in here you know where I'm going don't you and I said well honey I guess we'll just bring all the groomsmen and bridesmaids over I guess guess it just all ride with us to the reception and and I don't want to overdo it I don't and I don't want to embarrass my wife any more than she needs to be embarrassed but I just want to kind of tell you how she did she's said [Music] uh-uh now she don't say that all that much lately but in those days she was people out for a while no it's not that at all she just wanted to be with me she wanted to smooch me let's just tell it right out here she wanted to smooch me and she thought Two's Company today and Three's a Crowd there's a time for a buddy and there's a time for just you lover lips do you know what I'm saying so I I began to research the uh where does that come from Two's Company threes a crowd it's an idiom that means a third person is not welcome when two people want to be alone and let me just go ahead and say this cuz some of you are purple I notic this it's not single people that are purple it's all you that are married that are purple uh sometime it's not about smooching sometime it's just about sitting quietly drinking coffee together and you just want it to be you and your love you understand what's that in each other's company you know what that requires some time it even requires you to put down your phone sometime but but I can tell you that sometime just being in a room with the one you love you're reading your thing she's reading her thing that can be in itself precious it it doesn't always have to be conversation but it this this title to company through a crowd it's an idium that means a third person is not welcome when two people want to be alone for example you might say well I'll leave you two love birds alone two is company three is a crowd this expression alludes to a third person spoiling the privacy of a pair of lovers and was already a proverb used in the year 1546 I mean folks got it a long time ago more than folks get it today and do you know what they were saying in 1846 and this wasn't talking about automobiles it was talking about carts and wagons it was Two's Company the three is a crowd is and that's a fifth wheel you got four wheels on the cart you don't necessarily need the fifth wheel does anybody know where I'm coming from yes sir let's look at Genesis I'm going to need you to help me look at Genesis 24: 1 through n this was not my message today I I uh I built three messages this week and I thought I had settled but in the night just like last Saturday night the Lord came and he changed my mind and I had to get up this morning and build something entirely from scratch but I knew that this was the leading of the Lord to sort of set the theme of the camp meeting that in all things he that's right you know it's not necessarily church about pulling something else down it's it's just about putting him up Jesus referring to his crucifixion said if I be lifted up I will draw all men unto me he was speaking about being lifted up on the cross but how many of you know in another level of understanding we can say today that if we're busy lifting Jesus up people sometimes say today making Jesus famous that's exactly what we ought to be trying to do it's make sure that everybody knows he's the number one number one king of kings and Lord of lords he must have the when we share the gospel we should be sharing who Jesus is we should be more concerned about getting people to the New Birth than we should unscrambling the godhead for them because once you get people to the New Birth Jesus said in Red Letters when he the spirit has come he will lead you and guide you in to all truth that's right come on now so it's not always feasible to tell somebody uh in such and such a sermon 1956 paragraph 301 because some people will look at you like you've got two heads but what you can tell them is who Jesus is in your life folks aren't looking for a historical Jesus they're looking for one that has skin on him today one who's walking around in your shoe leather our life is a living epistle it's a living letter it's a living book read by all men and sometimes we don't want them to know but they're watching us anyway Genesis 24 and Abraham was old and well stricken in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh and I will make thee swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites uh this is from the region uh of of Canan of Canaan the AR original inhabitants of the land so to speak and if you wanted to bring some sort of a modern terminology brother brandham often referred to that region as Palestine because it was very correct to do so in that hour it's never been called Palestine Palestine came not not biblically it came from philistia H where we get the Philistines this was always land that God had his eye on for his people a and so uh Abraham was concerned why because God had brought him out of the land of er of the calans and caused him to separate from everything that he knew he left family be behind he left so many things he broke off he's constantly having to separate himself from everything familiar sir to go and find a land that he didn't even know where it was he didn't know how to get there but God said you come separate yourself unto me and I will make he he stood him up on the place of Elon Moray and told him to look over the land he said I'm going to make your seed as plentiful as the Sands of the seashore and as the stars of the heaven he later told Abraham all the nations of the Earth are going to be blessed because of your seed how many of you know that is absolutely nothing but the truth we have seen the Fulfillment of that in in the in the refounding of the modern state of Israel there's no doubt about it the technology that has rolled out of Israel has blessed the nations of the world paraplegics have walked because of the technology that has come out of Israel lugar's disease so many things in fact there are treatments available in Israel that we will never see in the United States of America because of the bureaucracy bureaucracy and the red tape that we have in our Health Care system in fact I know of of many situations like this and my wife does as well where men were entering the United States with inventions that could ere eradicate some of the diseases that wipe out so many people in this nation they were arrested their devices confiscated and the ability to rebuild and make outlawed come on and then they get in the news and debunk the possibility of this being able to help anybody when Israel is not just hoping so there doing it what a shame what a shame that people would not have access to the to the great grace of God that he has put upon uh the Jewish people that they would be able to pull some of these things together now God has brought him out he's left everything behind and it is his deepest concern now that his son Isaac not marry a woman of of the nation of the land why was that such a concern I read it to you in Leviticus anybody with me God wanted to make sure that his people were separated from other peoples sir and so Abraham when it come time for Isaac to have a wife he wanted a Kinsman he he wanted a relative he he wanted someone related to his family as it was done in that time and so he calls Eleazar in and he makes a covenant a vow he said uh H I will make thee swear by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell let's read on but Thou shalt go un my country to my Kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac now wouldn't you think he'd be taking Isaac with him but that's not what happened let's read on and the servant said unto him per Adventure the woman what if the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest now make sure you understand elaser is saying what if I get there and I can't I can't find a woman who will come back should I then quickly return to you are you here should I quickly return to you and bring Isaac and then take him back to your to your people to your countrymen oh I tell you this is not what Abraham wanted at all let's read on and Abraham said unto him beware that thou that thou bring not my son thither again leave him here the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto thy seed will I give this land he listen he shall send his Angel before thee eleazer don't worry what her answer will be don't worry whether or not she'll be willing follow you into a Strange Land to marry a man she's never laid eyes on I need some help you just know this that the Lord God the one who called me out the one who promised me an eternal inheritance he will send his Angel not Earthly come on now he will send his Angel to go before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from then in other words El it's going to be all right and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then Thou shalt be clear from this my oath you're forgiven pardon if if God doesn't do it if God doesn't send the angel before if the woman refuses to hear the angel you are let off the hook yes sir but you need to know right now I'm not going to let my son go off to that land god called my seed out out of that place hello now and I'm not going to let him go back amen you know in essence Abraham is saying I'd rather him live a life without a wife than to join himself to a woman from a people that God has rejected because of their Pagan ways I would rather him live a lonely life now this is pretty important because Abraham has to have some seed and without a wife Isaac is not going to be able to do that remember what happened when Jacob went and told Abraham a few chapters later Jacob said I found me a wife from among the Heathen come on Abraham said drag that boy do whatever you have to do you go find that that boy a wife it didn't matter that he already picked him one Abraham was going to make sure that it was a wife of Ken one who God had beg to make promises to even though they were not even aware they were not even aware of what God was doing down in the land yet uh email and texting was not available at the time is anybody still with me okay and then he said you're not going to bring my son therei again and the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swear to him concerning that matter now I want to read from uh from the sign of this time just a moment I want you to get the flavor of this he said like eleazer representative coming from Abraham see to pick up the bride to Isaac the beautiful Rebecca obedient the model servant see he was about his master's business alone he's describing the character of elaser and now he's going to type it out for us he said what a type of the Holy Spirit today what did we sing a few moments ago the the Blessed Holy Spirit from the father God above hath come down to earth to find a worthy bride here brother brandham tells us that the ministry of eleazer the servant of Abraham is a type of the Holy spirit and he said the same thing picking out a bride see in the in the evening time when the lights are going out now if you're still awake go with me to Genesis 24 and look at verse 10 for a moment I I just hesitated to read all these verses but as I started going through them I couldn't find ones to leave out so here we go and the servant took 10 camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to Mesopotamia unto the city of nahor and he made his camels to kneel down without the City by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water now let me just insert here that Josephus a Jewish historian describes what that Trek would have been like the Bible leaves it out the Bible makes it sound like he went across town and found a whale but we're talking about a long distance over many many Hills and down through many many valleys and places where there were no roads Abraham knew the way but he had to make a off hard journey to get over in the first place now Eleazar is returning back there are no highways there are hundreds of miles where there is nothing but dirt and hills and uh you know like brother Brandon would say scorpions and Cactus and you know it's just a desert out there but he gets there he finds a well and he said oh Lord God of master of my master Abraham I pray thee send me good speed this day and show kindness unto my master Abraham stay with me behold I stand Here by The Well of water and the daughters of the men of the city will come out to draw water and he said or and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say let down thy picture I pray thee that I may drink and she shall say drink and I will give thy camels drink also I I want you to notice that that eleazer is making it a little more difficult it's not so much that a woman would say I'll give you some of my water but she saw them 10 thirsty camels does anybody have any idea how many bathtubs of water it would take to fill up those thirsty camels and did anybody realize that she didn't go over there and turn on a faucet no sir and and she didn't have a hand pump no sir did anybody think about the fact that she had to draw buckets of water out skins of water out of deep deep Wells they had to dig these Wells extra deep because of the dry terrain of the desert and now she has uh he said if if this right woman comes may she not only offer to draw me water to drink but may she offer to give water to my C anals also what kind of woman is this I'll just tell you this I know I know what kind of woman this is because I married her you understand sir I married this kind of woman I married the kind of woman who would say I'm not just going to provide for you but but come on we we got to take care of the rest as well let the same be she that thou Hast appointed for thy servant Isaac it's a little test it's like a little fleece here and thereby shall I know that thou has showed kindness unto my master let's go on and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold Rebecca come out who was born to bethuel the son of Mila the wife of neor Abraham's brother second cousins with her picture upon her shoulder here she comes she's going to fill up this picture this water jug with water and take it back to her house in the message desperations paragraph 93 listen carefully brother bandam says eleazer got desperate when the responsibility was placed upon him to hunt a bride for Isaac eleazer of Damascus was a great man he was favored by Abraham notice he wasn't a Jew he was a Syrian he was favor by Abraham and he was trusted by Abraham to go out and hunt a bride a right type of a bride for his son Isaac though uh through that would bring forth Christ see it's a lineage that was being protected it's a bloodline that was being preserved are you with me now Eleazar being a spiritual man knowed what it meant he's not born a Jew but he's lived in the house of a spiritual man yes sir and he has become spiritual he said the right kind of a woman had to be that man's wife and how would he choose it in the hour of his desperation when he arrived at the city he prayed and said Lord God that's the thing when you get desperate listen what he's telling us not just for a wife not just for a husband but when you get desperate go to praying how many of you have got something that you're passionate for and you're desperate to see happen why not now why not this week yes sir so if you feel any desperation toward something let's go to praying brother bam said Lord God let the first maid that comes forth and Waters the camel and gives me a drink be that he prayed in the hour of his desperation Rebecca the beautiful maid came watered the camel and then he said don't delay me in my way I'm on a mission I've got something I've got to accomplish she had to come listen where is Isaac Isaac is at home sir at father's house right it has fallen the responsibility of eleazer to find the right kind of wife yes sir for the son of his master Abraham she had to come you've got to come yes sir she had to come to a time of decision whether she would go she was a type of the Bride would she go and marry a man who she has never ever even seen oo just think about it we live in a society where attraction is often based on look instead of character what is Rebecca going to do if she gets back and he's ugly on now what is she going to do this is not even in her heart he said now that's a great thing never even seen him yet she had only heard about him by his servant the thing that I appreciate the most about this ministry that God has sent to us is that he made Jesus a living Hebrews 13 and8 reality he didn't just tell the people he is the same he demonstrated sir hello that he is the same the blind saw the deaf heard the lame got up and walked the dead were raised he didn't just tell that he's the same he showed that he was the same in Christ is the mystery of God revealed he tells us that it's going to be up to the church to do the same thing yes sir we're not just going to be able to tell people he's the same we're going to have to show them that Jesus Christ is still the Savior that he's still the Healer that he's still the deliverer somebody said what is it going to take to get us to that place well desperations is going to help bring us in we're going to have to be struck by a desperation that drives us to our knees we're going to have to believe that the angel of the Lord will go before us and work on the other end of the line when you know God's telling you to witness to somebody when you know God's telling you to share with somebody you've got to hope and believe that the Lord is already preparing their heart because if God is not working on their heart they're going to cold refuse you but what if God is already on the other end he stirring them up and they know they've got to get straightened out they may even be praying Lord send somebody to me send somebody to me send somebody who will tell me what I need to do he said not never even seen him yet she had only heard by his servant he said that's a type of the Bride you've never seen Christ but you hear by his servants what he is you sell out everything stay with me folks this is vitally important leave your homes everything else it takes to go and find him nothing is more important than finding him hello nothing is more important not a career not an education not a relationship he said now notice she made the decision and what a decision it was he said a type of the Bride she left her comfort zone oh there you go brother brandom said she left her denominational home yes to go and see you see there are still people in this hour that are that are kind of hooked in to the name on the sign huh and when they're looking for a church they're looking for a church sign that says something like Assembly of God or church of God or Baptist or Methodist they're they're looking for a flavor come on and that's where they feel the most comfortable and maybe that's where Grandma went and something like that maybe granddaddy was a part of that many many years ago so they feel some kind of pull and some kind of connection but I want you to know there's a decision that has to be made in this hour and that is are we going to hold on to what is familiar oh come on now are you going to hold on to what is dying or you going to turn loose of that and find something that still has a heartbeat you see this Bride Can Only survive so long in a cemetery there comes an hour you say well isn't the word enough and we'll just uh press play and Obey and we'll do this and that and the other I want you to know we've been told the importance of an atmosphere of gathering together with Believers worshiping the Lord together to be transformed nothing could be more important than that and so we go on stay with me I know I keep saying that Genesis uh verse 24:1 16 now and the damsel I don't usually read this much and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her piter and came up and the servant ran to meet her and said he he he's about to do his part he's about to rehearse his part of the line he said I pray thee drink a little water of thy picture give me just a little sip of water from your picture and she's just as Fair beautiful uh uh like we described Rebecca her middle name is radiant and today is her birthday and we're preaching on Rebecca I want you to see uh her but a little older way older I want you to see her older she's at the well she's radiant she's she's shiny and here comes this old dusty old coder he's been through the desert his feet are dirty he stinks he smells like the camels that he's leading and he walks right up to her and he says could I have a little sip of water from your picture and she said drink my Lord she immediately honored his his age she honored him as an elder as a Lord she said drink my Lord and she hastened and let down her picture upon her hand and gave him a drink she took it down off of her shoulder she held it over to him and she gave him a drink of her water the water that she had Drew for her own family are you following this and and she and it goes on and she hasted and when she had done giving him drink she [Music] said I got a feeling that he was thirsty bone dry he drank about half the picture and she's standing there looking you said a drink you really meant a drink didn't you you're just drinking drinking drinking drinking drinking so she now knew that she was going to have to draw again to fill up her picture please understand these were water pots that are about like this these are huge water pots that they had to carry like this on their shoulder he's took a lot of that water she can't go home with a half half jug she's going to have to draw again to fill up the jug that she just filled and and for some outlandish come on now reason she said yes uh I'll draw water for thy camels also and she didn't say I'll just give them enough to with their whistle how many of you know the camel doesn't just drink for himself right that moment he drinks for after a while he fills up his Reservoir she said I woo hear this I'm going to give them water until they're finished drinking I don't know how many times she'd have to send that bucket down to fill up those camels and she didn't slack about it she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the TRU and ran again unto the well to draw water and Drew and Drew and Drew and Drew and Drew for all of his camels can you see this great effort that she's putting out a and the man wondering at her he asked God to do it that's right he did but he didn't think there was a woman anywhere on planet Earth that would do it he you know he may have expected more like get it yourself that's 2024 but she said I'll give yes sir my Lord have some of mine and she takes it down and when you're done I'll draw for your camels until they're finished drinking too oh my someone says to me here uh Ben is a fact checking me you know thank you Ben thank you Ben praise the Lord and I don't usually see my fat fact checks but I happen to see that one it's election season you know he said camels can drink up to 30 gallons of water in 10 minutes there were 10 that's 300 gallons of water what a woman and I married her I hope you did I hope you did first to get up last to go to bed is not asking anybody to do anything that she's not doing herself and more when it comes that that that's the woman that God gave me I'm thankful for her today I'm thankful for you who have found a wife like that who goes above and beyond do you know why I found a wife like that I was looking for one like that I wasn't looking in the bar I I wasn't looking on a drunk somewhere I wasn't looking in The Honky Tonk I wasn't looking in the biker Club I was looking among God's people I was looking in the house of the Lord come on now in the household of faith that that's where women of virtue like that can be found that's what the scripture said and the man wondering at her held his peace he wanted to spill it all right then he wanted to say Woo you're the one I've come to get you I'm taking you back to a foreign land and marrying you off to my master's son but he held his peace to whe whether the Lord had made his journey prosperous or not because he knew that even though she had fulfilled the test she had sort of fulfilled the feast the the fleece excuse me he knew that something had to change in her sir I want you to hear me something had to change in her heart right there was nothing about her that said I want to leave my town I want to leave my family I want to leave nothing about her would have caused you to think that she was looking for a ticket out of there so he said I'm I better keep this to myself just now it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden earring of a half a shekele weight and two bracelets for her hands of 10 shekels weight of gold and said whose daughter art thou tell me I pray thee is there room in thy father's house for us to Lodge in and she said unto him I'm the daughter of bethuel the son of Mila which she bear unto Nahar what verse are we at 25 thank you um and and she said moreover we have both straw and provender enough and room to Lodge in shake your neighbor and say sleep later but Wake Up Now The Preacher's preaching a long time but you need to hear it and the man bowed down his head and worshiped the Lord he's getting the idea this is her this is her this is her this is her this is her he bowed down his head in worship and he said bless be the Lord God of my master Abraham who ha not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth I being in the way hear it I'm on a mission of dedication and obedience I being in the way the Lord led me to the house of my Master's brethren and the damsel ran and told them of her mother's house these things now in the message time of decision I hope you're listening paragraph 27 and it was in the evening time when he come to the well near the city and it was about that time that Rebecca had to she had to make a decision I want you to say that again Rebecca had to make a decision I believe the angel of the Lord beat him there listen about half hour if God is in this Arrangement the angel of the Lord is going to go before you and he is going to prepare the heart of the young maiden and she's going to be willing to follow you wherever it is that you need to go yes sir that's right brother random said I believe the angel of the Lord beat beat beat Eleazar there by about a half an hour oh praise God it only took 30 minutes to help her make the right decision must have been the angel of God listen it must have been the angel of God that spoke to Rebecca's heart when God began to give us our children we begin to pray that he would show us their Destiny and we were blessed when God showed us that their Destiny was in this ministry and that God was going to plant them here to help us do the work of the Lord it was beyond our desire it's what the Lord showed us and when Benjamin met Jenna we didn't know Jenna Jenna came from a large Church much larger than this Jenna has a large family huge family I think when they're all gathered together be over a hundred or more of them her dad has many brothers and sisters the parents the grandparents are still alive and they're a close family and they get together and as the more we begin to learn the more concerned we begin to be and I remember finally saying to Benjamin you know honey you you you better find out before this thing goes too far you better find out if she will be willing to leave what she has always known and follow you so that you can walk in your destiny right and the Jenna that I thought I knew I wasn't sure what her decision would be but I had to throw myself on the mercies of the Lord and pray and believe these verses that if she was indeed the one that God had called for for him that the angel of the Lord would go before her and touch her before him and touch her heart heart and he did she loved him so much that she was willing to leave everything she was familiar with behind and embrace his Destiny somebody said well doesn't a woman have a Destiny she does and it's up to God to bring the right woman and the right man together because it's a it's a destiny that has to be walked out it doesn't always look the same the logistics may be a little different as we go along but there there comes a time that in in a situation like that that a woman has to say it's not that I want to leave what I love it's not that I want to leave what is uh you know familiar to me but I recognize the call listen the destiny that was on Isaac was of such importance that the promise of God the word of the Lord was at stake I'm going to make your seed as plenteous as the Sands of the seashore and the stars of Heaven Isaac couldn't do that by himself there had to be a Rebecca who was willing to say the destiny that God has laid on your life is more important than what I want and what I desire I I appreciate that little bit of help because it gets pretty it gets pretty hairy in the hour that we're living living in it can be a lot of fighting it can be a lot of misunderstanding because the in the New Testament Jesus talks about the fact that a that a man would have to leave his mother and father and cleave unto his wife and there's no doubt about it it is very important that a man be willing to do that you can't take Mama side against wife you can't take Daddy's side against wife when that commitment is made you have joined yourself to one another and that's how it has to be amen but a Destiny is is over both of their lives they might not have seen the end yet of either they might not have discerned what the end will be but but love love comes love comes and when Love Comes see well well how could Rebecca have loved what she didn't see what she didn't know well let me tell you something when the angel of the Lord Goes Forth he can put a love in your heart for something you don't know anything about you hear a truth that you can't dissect and you can't explain but something in your heart says that's the truth I love that truth you couldn't explain it yet you you couldn't ground it in the word yet but something in you lays a hold of that and says that's part of who I am I'm going to follow that through are you with me that Rebecca had to make a decision he said I believe the angel of the Lord beat him there about half an hour I'm hurrying for he will send his angels before you then makes the the way clear and it must have been it must have been the angel of God that spoke to Rebecca's heart said go get the water because Rebecca didn't know what Eleazar was praying and Rebecca came to the Water of Life when at the evening time give me just a moment he said you get the picture it's the church in the last days the evening time the evening lights are here it's the time that the angel of the Lord in a Supernatural is revealing himself to the Rebecca to the bride the angel of the Lord that's not an ordinary Angel that's the angel of the Covenant that's the angel with a rainbow about his head that angel is not brother brandham that angel is the Lord Jesus Christ the angel and messenger of the Covenant it's found right grounded in the scripture but here he is on the earth manifesting himself dealing with people's hearts he said is revealing himself to the Rebecca the Bride of Isaac and somehow or another she's moved to go to the waters yes of life she didn't even know how thirsty she was she didn't know how dissatisfied she was but all of a sudden when the angel of the Lord visits her she starts getting this hunger I've got to get to the water I've got to get to the water I've got to get to the water and so she goes to the well hello it's a natural typing a spiritual and a spiritual typing something that plays out in the natural can you say amen and so he goes on oh my heart is turning over with joy listen as I read these verses not these quotes particular but as I read the scriptures today this morning going over them again I began to weep at the table my wife said are you all right what are you saying I said honey I'm not talking to you I got so moved I got so stirred in hearing this story in reading this story again I remember remember my own story I remember how the angel of the Lord prepared my heart to make the right decision I didn't know the ins and the outs I didn't know the what ifs and the maybe I didn't know what the future would look like all I knew is that I had heard something like I had never heard before and my heart was burning and yearning for more and if if it meant leaving my people if it meant leaving my church I was pastoring a church if it meant leaving my church if it meant leaving my friends it didn't matter to me anymore all I knew was I had to get to the well I had to get to the well I had to get to the well the evening time has come the angel of the Lord's in the message he goes forth and Woos the Rebeca to come to the Waters of Life the moving of the supernatural not a painted fire but a real fire amen uh paragraph 29 so why did Rebecca make that sudden move why did she make that sudden move why did she go to the Waters of life so quickly why could she could the angel speak to her because listen because she was a blood relation to Isaac had she not been a Kinsman had she not been of the family had she not been of the same bloodline she might not have received the words of the Angel there was something laying in her there was a destiny already in her there was a blood already in her come on there was a gene already in her there was a representation of life already in her and that's why she could hear the word of the Angel that's why her heart could already be ready so that when elaser got there she didn't have any hesitation he said he said now blood relation and that's who the angel can speak to tonight I'm going to say this morning is a blood relation by the blood we are born into the body of Christ Rebecca was Isaac's own cousin by both fathers which made them blood relation and the Bride of Jesus Christ is Sanctified how through the blood of Christ and an open vessel for the Holy Spirit to do what to speak to don't you ever be shut off off to the voice of the spirit because he may speak to you she'll come no wonder she'll come to the Waters of life he that heareth let him come to the Waters of Life freely the bride said he that's a thirsty let him come blessed are ye when you hungry in thirst for righteousness for you shall be filled it's a promise are you here it's a promise of the father watch this she made her decisions quick yes sir sir it's none of your business on now it's none of your business when somebody makes their decision quick as a result of the Lord preparing the heart sir boy you'll sign up for things you to never signed up for before when the Lord is working on your heart hello hello hello didn't you do it April didn't you do it didn't I have you in that little room back there said to you April are you sure you know what you're doing the man that you're about to marry is sick and maybe be sick unto death we're going to believe everything that we have with everything we have that God will heal him and raise him up but if he doesn't you'll be a widow it won't be an easy life she looked at me with with strong eyes and said I would do it if we only had a few hours a few minutes a few days a few just a fleeting moment together I would do it because I love him something had already happened in her heart I I know I've taken a lot of time and I'm not done I want you to be ready for these preachers that are coming I'm the least of them but I want you to be ready for them when they get here I want you to hear what the Lord is saying I couldn't have talked her out of it if I if I if I wanted to I didn't I just wanted to make sure but God had already moved on her heart her heart had already opened and love was already there it was too late then to talk about liking one another what what if I would have said now April you know you all are going to go steady a while and you're going to write a little note that says do you like me and check yes or no and he's going to write a little note do you like me check yes or no too late too late Hearts had already been touched no price was too great because Hearts had already been touched she made her decisions quick watch her real quick then in the meeting quickly if they're ordained here he talking about us now again if they're ordained to eternal life they'll know it there's something in the message there's something in the message that stirs them maybe they've never heard anything that long before maybe they've never heard anything that loud before maybe they've never heard anything that out of out of out feel before unorthodox before but something in their heart yes I put in the tape spoken word is the Original Seed never heard a tape message like that never heard a sermon like that never heard a topic like that never heard a title like that but I want you to know the angel of the Lord had come before preparing my heart to receive what was my destiny amen my heart was already stirred by the message from the angel of the Lord that Holy Spirit preparing me oh can't you see the picture of the Angel of the Lord leading her the angel of the Lord was leading her then she was stirred and immediately when she watered the camp the gift went on her and he began to take out the earrings which means oh wait just a minute don't be a jezebel and hang all that stuff on you like you're some kind of Christmas tree or something and you need ornaments he said why this means that Faith cometh by hearing you see put the bracelets on and that doesn't mean to deck herself out and tingle and tinkle and make noise when she walks like people want to do today something in their heart makes them want the the flashy flashy flashy and the blingy blingy blingy can you imagine Believers of this truth saying I I want to be blingy it's going to be real quiet do you think Rebecca was out to be blingy you think she wanted to look like some kind of wrestling bride wrestling wife you think she wanted to spiked hair and uh it bleached out white and uh leather pants you think she wanted to be some kind of uh do you get the picture yet she didn't need them earbobs she didn't need all those bracelets to decorate herself this was a spiritual message coming The Works of your hands he said the bracelets talk about the works of your hand the earring is talking about hearing faith comes by hearing he got her ready as soon as she began to water give the Waters of Life testify tell others get the message out tell them what has happened to you he said tell them if you can't preach like some preacher over there you can't do like somebody else you go tell them how your candle got lit I'm trying to brag on Haw for the preaching he did in Michigan last week and he starts at oh well I don't think it was very good I'm not Dynamic and I kept waiting on that unction that would make me really get in there and and do such and such and such what he was doing was comparing his delivery to somebody else's that's wrong you can't do that God knows who he sent me to God knows who he was sending off to there were three Muslims sitting out on the Pew they they didn't need perhaps any spitting sputtering and carrying or sweating and snorting and snotting like I do they just needed a simple testimony of a life how many of you were here were just a few weeks ago when sister dla stood up back there she didn't come to the altar if you want to know her story raised in a Muslim home married a believer of this message who was lukewarm if anything and decided that come here to visit his family and decided that she they didn't know whether she'd come to church or not so they told her we'll we be home in a little while she said I'm going with you something in her mind said I want to go to church with you and here she come and she didn't tell people her background or or anything like that and we begin to sing How Great Thou Art and the angel of the Lord hear it has to be had already started preparing her heart to receive Jesus she didn't come to the Altar and kneel down at her seat God began to make a difference in her life life she began to surrender her heart she had to tell her family and she was here for the first time in 10 years yeah to give her testimony to tell you while we were shocked when we got the testimony some weeks later we got the testimony she said I got saved in your church raised a Muslim my whole family a Muslim I sat there on a Sunday morning I heard the song it touched my heart I heard your words it spoke to me I gave my heart to the Lord Jesus change her life change her marriage now they've got all these children that morning God knew what she needed last Sunday morning in Michigan God knew what those people needed they were off the street don't you compare yourself your delivery your demeanor your way I used to hear people all the time say I wish I was such and such I wish I was more this I wish I was more that I W why don't you just let God make you what he wants you to be and quit apologizing because you're not somebody Follow Your Destiny follow what God has called you to do and be quick about it quit dragging your feet hear me quit dragging your feet Rebecca heard and she made a quick decision yes sir the best decision yes sir of her whole life okay I'm starting Sunday night service now I read where someone posted said any church that's on fire will never call off a Sunday night service I'm glad I'm not waiting on you to tell me what fire is when they get out of here on a Sunday they've been to both Services they're so hungry they can't hardly stand they've already fasted you you come here on Sunday morning you've done fasted all morning brother you're you leave here spiritual just tell them what's happened to you woo and and and I had to put this one in here this was in Mesa Arizona I've had the privilege of preaching in the building in the little church behind the same pool pit the very same pull pit where this sermon was preached oh so many years ago and I was doing it for the same Pastor in 1991 doing it for the same Pastor that was the pastor in the church in 1963 when this sermon was being preached brother Roy Carpenter who is is now with the Lord elaser sweated it out until he found character that's right who would he give yet he trusted God he knew it couldn't just be any female it had to be of a certain character for his master son I got to find just the right woman character for what character for Isaac the bride which the church is a type of you know that that was the natural Seed of Abraham this is the Royal Seed of Abraham let's go on he said well if elas are the messenger hunting the bride and trying to find character if that man is come a messenger of the last day trying to find the bride for Christ he will not look for a denominational membership he's not going to check the name on the door and make sure it's something he's heard of before he will look for character that's willing watch good character first then to get her ready to meet Isaac after he found the character then get her stand still long enough to listen to the message of Isaac she needed to know a little bit about what Isaac was about she needed to know a little bit about what Abraham was about right so so he had to begin to tell her a little bit you know he's the son of of your relative Abraham oh yeah I I I heard of him he left here in a huff he turned his back on all of us and went off into a Strange Land following an unknown God a God who is invisible the Jews belied that Abraham's father was an idol maker and all you had to do was go down to his shop and buy whatever God you wanted to worship now Abraham rejects the religion of his father and his family and goes off to a Strange Land and he's hearing voices I'm not so sure about cousin Abraham he's hearing voices you know talking to himself and talking out loud like there's somebody listening and answering a voice that no one else can hear but Abraham I want you to know she could have said all those things and so we understand that Eleazar just begin to lay it out God's keeping his promise God's doing for Abraham what he told him that he was going to do and the time has now come that Isaac have a bride because it's about to be the time that the seed are going to begin to come and multiply why she could have said wait a minute I don't want but one child two is more than enough you said his seed's going to be like the Sands of the seashore I don't want to be the mother of all that sand I don't mind to be the mother of a few stars but I don't want to be the mother of all the stars she could have said a lot of things but God Was preparing her heart that she would stand still long enough and hear what Isaac was all about she didn't believe the gossip good brother someone said to me last Sunday after being here in the service said I came here having heard all kinds of things but I didn't find any of that didn't see any of that didn't feel any of that all I felt was the genuine Holy Spirit in the house what if Rebecca would have listened to All the gossip about crazy old Abraham and Prejudiced herself against this destiny that God was calling her to but rather she was prepared by the angel of the Lord he said that's the measure of the last days the evening light first find the church where they will believe the message hunted can you read what I'm talking about he said hunt where the church is that'll even let you come in won't close the door in your faith what do you think about Austin Hodes going up there to a church a few weeks ago and and preaching to a bunch of people that don't believe like we believe there's the answer if they'll open the door and you've got a mind to go go tell them what's right and don't cram it in their face live it make them hungry leave them wanting more because if it's in them it'll be like sister Nancy Bergen leading a Ministry in Israel and she didn't know me and said I I want you to come and preach this weekend for us met her at a prayer meeting I I'll come I got up and preached she said I want you to come back tonight I'll come I got through preaching I want you to come next week I said now wait a minute I'm here with my father-in-law and my Deacon and and and and my associate pastor and we we uh we I've got to show them some things we're here to see some things brother West brother West he's with the Lord he said now brother Shelly if you think I come just to see some rocks he said' if they want to know you better go tell them so I did I said okay we'll come we rushed to get there but we got there and when it was time to leave she said if you don't mind I would like to have a little chat with you in the garden well the brothers are there waiting on me I said okay I'll go out in the garden and have a little chat with you I walked out there and she said now I've Been Around Church a long time I've been around the Bible a long time and she said you didn't fool me that's how she said it you didn't fool me I said ma'am what do you mean she said you didn't fool me she said I saw what you were doing you weren't telling the whole story about anything she said you were just dropping little nuggets here and little nuggets there and you were just waiting to see if anybody would take the bait she said I'm her now tell me what this is about I want to know the godhead I want to know the baptism I want to know this intimacy that you were preaching about I want to know that I caught the bait and now I'm here God was working on her heart may God give you ministers may God give you testifiers may God give you w you who go out in witness may God give you dozens of Nancy berens that he's already preparing their heart to hear the Li life changing message of the revelation of Jesus Christ I got to close come on and close or come on and preach somebody say come on what which come on Hunt where the church is that'll even let you come that won't close the door in your face and then when you do there then you found character now if she'll stand still long enough to tell her how the bride's got to be dressed she's got to be clothed stand still if she could get it look at that little Rebecca listening to every word her little heart was beating he was telling her what it was like in the household of Abraham what Isaac was like he said now you sweated it out where will I go until I find the character then when I find the character then make her stand still long enough to get her ready to go meet him oh my what a striking thing wish we had a little more time on the like me too get her ready stand still to listen to his message of him elezar wasn't speaking of himself hear this if you're putting brother brandham here as the eleazer you would be exactly right but remember that he was a messenger of the of the true eleazer which for our day is the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost didn't come talking about himself brother Brandon wasn't here to promote his own self never I'm not here preachers better not be here elizar wasn't speaking of himself he was speaking of the one that had sent him and he had the gifts to prove that he was sent from him amen he said here's Abraham's gift he sent you some gifts he wanted to clothe her with these things you know how he fixed her up and that's exactly right now I'm going to have to stop and and finish this Saturday night but I I I oh Lord help us I know I'm already going to be ribbed for taking so long but I would like to just give me one moment just don't don't go nowhere yet just hold still just a minute I I'll I I'll just give you one more little piece of this come on verse 54 and they did eat and drink now I'm skipping a portion here where laan the brother is hosting Abraham he has gone to the house he has laid out the mission he has told the things that that he wanted to tell the family in verse 54 and they didn't even drink he and the men that were with him and tear it all night they rose up in the morning he said send me away unto my master now he had already laid out the the this the mission and they had agreed and Rebecca has agreed it's all settled Rebecca's going to go the family's going to let her go things have been distributed they called under Rebecca her brother and mother listen listen let me let me not do this disj Justice he said send me away to my to my master and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days now this is just like folks we're going to let her go we've already agreed to let her go but we're not going to let her go until we can find her replacement we're not going to let her go till another daughter is aged up to where she's eligible we're not going to let her go let her stay here with us just a little while longer let us have a few more days with our beloved Rebecca they weren't being mean maybe slightly selfish but very understandable let the damsel abide with us a few days at the least 10 and after that she shall go remember eleazar's on a mission he said don't hinder me on the way I I've got a job to do I got to get this job done I got to get out of here I got to get back to my master he's going to wonder what's going on over here I've got to get back and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the Lord hath prospered my way send me away that I may go to my master it wasn't you they was worried about it was Rebecca they wanted to hold on to Rebeca well he wasn't going to leave without her that's right and they said we will call the damsel and inquire at her mouth she's already agreed to go and they called Rebecca and said unto her wilt thou go with this man she said I will go and they sent away Rebecca their sister and her nurse and Abraham's servant uh uh and his men and they blessed Rebecca she had the final say mama said I want you to stay 10 more days uncle said I want you to stay 10 more days but he wasn't up to Uncle and it wasn't up to Mama and it wasn't up to anybody else it was up to Rebecca had the angel of the Lord prepared her heart had he placed a love in her heart for somebody that you hadn't even met on now they called she said I'll go they sent her away and they blessed Rebecca and said unto her Thou Art our sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the gate woo of those who hate them come on now this is prophecy and Rebecca arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took Rebecca and went his way brother brandham says this and then there was another great decision that had to be made then after she was given the parents said well I just let her stay around 10 let her hang around the Revival to really feel whether she was decided to do it or not you know let her have a moment she might want to change her mind he said I haven't got much confidence in a person make a decision to wait even until tomorrow don't put off what you know God's doing but the message stirred Rebecca she was satisfied that the message was from God so the parents said oh let her STI around a while she'll get over it it's just a little excitement now she was over to that Revival you know and blah blah blah come on but he said the true servant said don't weary us don't hinder us a lot of Servants of God has been hindered by put off decisions don't hinder me seeing that the Lord has sent me seeing that he's been good to me don't hinder me then they said let her make her own decision that's where you stand tonight make your own decision every Rebecca come on I've been a Rebecca somebody said I can't even relate to that I've been a Rebecca you've been a Rebecca yes sir let her make her own decision tonight yes sir if she knows that it's right why would she hinder linger and T then they called Rebecca and said will you go with this man or do you want to stay around a little while to see whether you really want to or not how long does it take take my goodness she said I will go and she was ready her decision was what quickly made she know there's something been leading her she knowed something had happened to her and she knew that it was God and she was satisfied that she wanted to go quickly that's what happens when God's working on both ends of the line so she put on her garment and she she got all the gifts that was sent to her by the father to meet the son oh God if the church could only make that decision right quick to put on all the gifts all of her gifts and climbed on the camel and did what took off now I'm closing musicians are coming and I'm stopping I'm just having to just stop but I want you to summarize this in your mind the best part is is yet to come because when we pick this up we're going to find that Rebecca is riding on the very camel that she watered isn't that powerful the very thing brother bam said the very thing that you've watered the very thing that you've poured into is a thing that's going to take you to where you're supposed to be isn't that amazing so when you come in here praising God you're watering you're pouring water on him that's right when you come in here with a true genuine Amen to the word you are pouring water on the very thing you are water in the very thing that's going to pack you all the way now look this way look this way just a minute hear me just a second and then we're going to get to something even greater than that and anybody any real preacher could have already gotten there but I'm not him so I couldn't make it yet when they get close Isaac comes out of the tent he's been staying in his mother's tent he's he's grieving A lot's going on and he's been sleeping in his mother's tent and he he leaves the tent and the Bible says he goes out in the field Rebecca's never seen him and she's riding up on that Camel brother I want you to know having been one who's rode a camel she wasn't looking too pretty her hair was dirty her face was dirty she smelt like a camel whether she had on them gold earrings and bracelets and all that she must have I mean she must have looked like a fancy dirty woman I don't know but oh listen the Bible said and Isaac lifted his eyes he's standing out in the field here comes eleazer riding along Here Comes Rebecca riding along On a camel and the scripture said and he lifted up his eyes and he saw her brother bam said it was love at first sight in that moment he loved her and in that moment she loved him there was nobody there to say we ought to take another three months and discuss this there was nobody there to say we we better make sure this is right the Bible said she come down off of that Camel and he took her where did he take her right back to the tent where he'd been sleeping right back to his mother's tent without a full ceremony without a big hoopla there was a covenant that was made in that tent when two people became one person she would have never been there had it not been for the for the teaching for The Obedience of Eleazar she would have never known that it was time for Isaac to have a bride she would have never been eligible she would have never found herself at the right place at the right time had God not sent eleazer had Abraham not sent eleazer over there to get her I want you to hear this she wouldn't have known she wouldn't have been there it wouldn't have happened but because God through Abraham sent Eleazar over there told her what the situation was told her what it was like in the household of his master she said I'll go family said stay a while no I'll go I'm ready to go now I know this is what I'm supposed to do so they ride that long journey when they get back she sees him in the field he sees her on the monkey they love one another from the moment that they lay eyes on one another they know this is right this is it he he he takes her helps her off she gets off he leads her to his mother's tent and they consummate their commitment one to another wouldn't have happened without eleazer but when we get to that scripture on Saturday night and we read about it it simply tells us and he took her into his mother's tent she became his I'd like to ask you a question as we close to give you a little thought of what will be Saturday night where was eleazer we're not reading about him he had to report to Abraham he had to make sure the rest of the the servants got back to the house he had to make sure the camels were brought he had to make sure that the he was not finished until he stood before his master Abraham and said job is finished sir what do you mean the job is I found her did she hesitate no she didn't hesitate well where is she I want to meet her well sir when Isaac saw her he loved her when she saw him she loved him they're in Sarah's tent he's taking her for his wife I don't have to describe to you what that means what it looks like everybody in this room knows that in that moment once you get to the bridegroom once you have met the bridegroom to's company threes a crowd she didn't drag eleazer in the tent and say tell me more Isaac didn't drag eleazer in the tent and say now catch me up on the details because the work that Eleazar was sent to do was done and nobody's going to forget Eleazar I want you to know he was given great riches great honor great respect for his labor of obedience and for not letting anything distract him in the way and when we speak of him today yes sir we speak of him with honor and respect because of the job the loyal y that he showed The Obedience that he showed the price that he paid to get Rebecca back to Isaac amen but the emphasis for Rebecca is no longer on eleazer yes sir if you were to visit uh Rebecca's home it wouldn't be every wall a picture of eleazer Sir on come on now it wouldn't be that everybody who walks in Rebecca's home and Isaac's home would have to sit down and hear the whole thing on and I need to tell you about the cloud and I need to tell you about the picture in Houston and I need to tell you about the bridge and I need to tell you about this and I there's a time for that it's right it happened and there's a time for that but I want you to know there's also a time when who is company it's you and Jesus it's you and the word it's you and the bridegroom you'd better be careful I better be careful how I try to drag somebody else in to that moment of consummation to that moment of the fullness of of the relationship stand the relationship please the relationship he came like Eleazar of old he came with a message he came to introduce us to our Isaac and like John the Baptist the messenger of the first coming he knew the day would come I must decrease and he must increase if you leave this place visitor or or home folk if you leave this place and you go out there and you say well he was just bringing brother brandham down he was just tearing him down he was just pulling him down you are so wrong and I refuse to accept your characterization of what's happened here today because lifting up Jesus letting him have preeminence is in the church letting him be the reason why we sing and the reason why we preach and the reason why we worship and the reason why we dance and the reason why we dress holy and the reason why we believe that God is one and the reason why we're baptized in jesus' name and Theon reason why we know we have to have the Holy Ghost letting Jesus be the reason it's not pulling anybody down or disrespecting any messenger had it not been for elaser most of us would have never known who Isaac really is but the reality comes that when the Covenant was sealed yes sir it's not the image of a prophet that I want to see just let let me see him let me spend time in that word let me be changed it doesn't mean not listen oh my we've got to hear this message has been saved for us we've got to hear spiritual food in due season we've got to show it it's our daily bread it's our food it fits the word it's got to be a part of our lives but we must listen I I hear them singing songs about the cloud I I hear them singing songs about Sabino Canyon and I hear them singing all these songs and putting brother brandom's name in and and when I sit there I I know in my heart I know in my heart that that would be such an embarrassment to him he he would be so ashamed so embarrassed that the attention was on him all of the these years since his death he's hanging on every wall of the church the pictures everywhere it's the reason why some people gather I feel like he would certainly be embarrassed I heard him singing just recently that about the message is the coming of the lord and there is a truth there the message is the coming of the Lord but what if some generation comes along Our Generation Young Generation and hears that and they believe that that's the only coming what what if they get a hold of that and they think well because he came in an appearance and because he came in the fullness of his word through his bride that he's not coming I want you to know he has come it's like Jesus said of John the Baptist he's coming but he's come already I want to say that he's coming he's come already in the fullness of his word but that doesn't mean that he's not coming one day in the Clouds Of Glory to receive a bride unto himself we're nearer to that than we have ever been before it's not your preacher you need in the tent with you it's not the prophet you need in the tent with you it's not some old dusty song you go in singing it's you and the lamb it's you and Christ the word we are feeding on the body word word of Jesus Christ we're thankful for the voice Hall just bow your head for a moment father it's you that we really want to see you are the same today as when you walk the shores of Galilee your form has changed but you are still God Almighty the Emmanuel you have now had the desire of your heart fulfilled you are no longer just God With Us and God above us as we read in the Old Testament but you have now become God in us the very life of Jesus Christ is living in your little bride in this hour and we better be careful where we take that life and how we live with that life in Us and how we name the name of the Lord and continue in the things of sin and unbelief oh God let a desperation strike Us in this meeting this week that we would renew our covenant with you and we would find a new passion for your word and find a new passion to spend time with you Lord and may we spend more time lifting up your name and telling what you have done for us may we spend our time pointing people ahead instead of pointing them behind oh God may we take full advantage of where your word has placed Us in the tent with Christ the word and may we hunger more and thirst more for you said that hung reth and thirsteth after righteousness the same shall be filled would you Worship the Lord with us this morning for a few moments would you lift him up if you have to leave I certainly can understand that at 2:20 in the afternoon but if you could stay just a few more more moments and Worship the Lord with us today lift up Jesus before we leave here today make sure that you have Let Jesus have the preeminence is that you have exalted him high he is worthy the lamb is worthy he is worthy to be praised if you believe that shout amen amen he's worthy beloved into your Embrace draw me my beloved let me look into your face my beloved is mine
