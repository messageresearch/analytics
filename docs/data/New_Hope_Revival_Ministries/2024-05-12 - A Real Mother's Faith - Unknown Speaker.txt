we would be sanctuaries living sanctuaries living Epistles rid of all men that's what we want to be that's our desire Lord hallelujah do you have a need today by the lifting of the hand all over the house there are needs out across the streaming the needs that you have we're asking the Lord to minister to those needs today today brother Austin Hodes came with a prayer request asking us to remember his mother's father that would be his grandfather Jim Kimmy Kim Jim Kim was taken to the ER overnight and it appears that they have found some kind of a mass on his pancreas we want to remember him to the Lord today ask the Lord to to give him a complete miracle in the name of the Lord I have several I hope I can remember them all Brother David and sister Sandy flew out of town they were scheduled to go in July to visit his friend lifelong friend Brother David said he has been with me through some of the toughest times of my life and the report from the doctor was that he had only a week to live so they flew to be with him this weekend pray for them yes Lord both of them love this man dearly and I'm sure there are other people who do yeah brother Josh and sister hope are not here today because baby Nathan uh was coughing a lot and has congestion they the doctor suggested because of his age they bring him to the hospital the doctor has checked him now and they're feeling like they're testing for viral but they feel like that it's just a cold his little system is is fighting uh a cold so we want to pray we want to pray and ask the Lord to touch his body and I think the other boys have not been feeling too good maybe they're better now so sister Claudia is home with the boys let's pray for them uh Lord urgently um um that might have been the main ones I'm so sorry I if I give any detail then I forget um I'd like prayer um I had some blood work done this week and and there are a lot of numbers that are not where they need to be I'm not sure what it means it could mean a small infection all the way up to something more serious I won't know until I see the doctor again I believe that God has it and it's just a bump in the road right and that all is well yes many unspoken requests yes yes yes all right let's take these needs to the Lord today it is so sweet to trust in Jesus just to take him at his word is so sweet to trust in Jesus just to take him out his word just to rest upon his prise just to know thus sayth the Lord Jesus Jesus how I trust him how I prove him all [Music] Andor Jesus Jesus preious Jesus Oh for Grace to trust him Chad will you come and pray Jesus Jesus how I trust him how I prove him all andore Jesus [Music] Jesus Oh for Grace to trust in more let's pray this morning Heavenly Father we count it a privilege to be gathered in your name in your house and in your presence Lord father we thank you for the blessings that you've been pouring out upon us Lord and I ask God that you would continue to do that today Lord every need that's represented in this house would you just come in a supernatural way and meet each and everyone heal sick bodies Lord touch those that are in pain and discomfort in their bodies Lord I pray that your strength would come and help Lord I pray that you would bless every single mother that's gathered here today not only in the house but also on the street I ask that your blessing would be with them and on them today in a special way Lord let them know that they are special and that they are loved not only by you but also by their families that surround them Lord we thank you for what you're going to continue to do in this service I pray that you would meet every single need Minister use our pastor today to minister to us Lord strengthen him in his body send a complete healing Lord from head to toe father whatever the doctors have seen Lord we just ask that you would correct it and may the next visit just reveal that he is completely and totally whole and well we claim it and we believe it in Jesus name thank you for your blessings we pray these things in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amenes praise the Lord can you give the Lord a shout of Praise today Hallelujah you may have your seats today want to wish wish the mothers a very happy Mother's Day very very thankful to have my mother still living and uh talked to her last night and her voice sounded real good dad is doing well as well he you know he 85 and he don't know how to let somebody else do the yard work and so he pays for it when he does but I'm thankful that they're they're well the Lord is good Thomas and Sarah and Wyatt it's sure good to have you today the Lord bless you we're glad that you're with us this week [Applause] again we want to receive the tithe and the offering I believe that it was uh mentioned that we would receive special offering for the building fund today so we'll do that in a little while to conserve time I'm going to ask brother Austin and brother ellias to come to you for the tithe and offering and I'm going to just talk to you a little bit uh give you a little report of what has happened while we were away uh so perhaps you can give while I'm talking uh and we'll give the other offering in just a little bit uh so some time ago last September actually we were uh going to Pennsylvania to minister and we stopped by this church in Ohio brother Shelly had mentioned a video that he had seen he didn't tell me um what it was he just told me that he had watched a video of of this particular pastor and was it brother cam or was it brother Simon cam all right because brother Simon his brother also preached a similar uh message but anyhow that's beside the point these brothers are products of brother Isaiah Brooks um the his ministry when he was in Lima and these these boys were uh they they grew up Assembly of God their parents are still Assembly of God his mother at least and uh they they were Assembly of God and they had you know gone their way college kids and so forth and somehow or another through a Bible study they were connected Simon first was connected with brother books and the assembly there in Lima and so uh brother Simon started going and the the other children they they didn't much see it but as time went on then uh brother cam also saw truth brother Jesse saw truth their sister Betsy saw truth and they started going down to brother Brooks and sat under the sound of the word well things were so moving that his uh brother Cameron's sister Betsy was telling us last Sunday night that the Ministers of the town around where they lived had a conference because of these kids that are leaving their churches for this cult and so they were getting worried because the these young people were going down to Lima to this cult and that's that's how many people were going down there and and sitting under the sound of the word and so you know I don't know where all these people are we were just sitting there talking with with with them last weekend but anyhow we were invited to go to this church uh got a call a few weeks ago asking me to come it it was uh a surprise to me to get the phone call but I responded to it and we went and preached there last weekend and I don't know exactly why that I got so bold but uh I think some of you have have listened to the sermon after brother Shelley said something here last Sunday don't know why that I was so bold don't know why I was so long- winded but I got it out and God did some wonderful things at the end of the service and uh received uh text from somebody you know sometimes you you want wonder about people you you wonder what they're thinking and and how you know they can sit As Dead As a log while they're listening to you but then you get a text that said that was so refreshing wow and uh so I don't know what all the Lord is doing with that I just commit that into his hands but there was a great response and if you watched the whole thing you saw the pastor's response at the end and and I'm grateful for that I didn't I didn't receive any private uh rebuke uh so that's that's good and then Sunday we were given the opportunity to preach again and God did some amazing things at the end of the service again and testimonies were coming into to the pastor um and I've not yet uh I I I've not been able to get a word from him since I left and so I don't know what that's all about but I know God is doing good things no matter what we may see what we may feel what we may hear God is doing good things anyhow one particular one I want to mention there was a there was a brother that came for prayer on Saturday night and and it appeared that he got a a partial break through but he didn't get all that he wanted and Sunday morning after the preaching he came again and he wanted prayer again but you could see that he was lighter than he was the night before and so he came from for prayer and he's just there and he's he started kind of breathing real heavy and I just laid my hands on him and I said that's right breathe in the fragrance of heaven and laid my hands on him and he continued breathing and we went and prayed for somebody else and I watched him as as brother cam took his hands off of him and his expression was just wow and so I don't know what the Lord did for him all I know that God was working in him and I believe God to to do what he wants to do I I believe that God is he's he's connecting the bride in ways that we don't understand bone to bone and and and you know why did that message get preach there when it's what they believe I have no idea unless it's to let somebody know that there's other people out there that believe what you believe and and so God is connecting us he's moving us and and we came home with with uh with other invitations that we don't know exactly how that we're going to be able to to do them but uh we're thankful that the Lord is working and he's moving but I'm thankful to be home with my My Tribe I'm glad to be home with you and to know that God is still moving among us that he is doing marvelous things in our midst and and don't s don't don't have it come out of your mouth well I don't see it you reach in and say Lord I want what there what everybody's I I and when we press in God is faithful to give us what we need he knows how to do it he knows how to he knows how to meet the need in our lives when when we're hungry and thirsty but I'm thankful that he can minister to us I tell you he ministered to me in a song a couple of weeks ago because I was having a little bit of anxiety about a new place and he ministered in a song in a beautiful way and I watched the Lord perform exactly what that song said I watched him perform it while we were gone uh we had the opportunity to go over and visit the the uh our friends at the fellowship in Indiana our former Amish friends that are there continuing on in the uh presence of the Lord and we ministered at their little gathering there on Wednesday night and we're thankful for what the Lord is doing among them and and though the enemy rages God moves on and he helps them to keep pressing on and we're thankful for what God is doing in them and through them how that they are reaching out uh some of you know sometimes I wonder if they're ever home it always seems like that they're traveling and and most of you know who brother Elum is and it was kind of neat while we were in Ohio and the pastor's brother brother Simon who works with him there in the church he is kind of a teacher but he was going over to preach for brother Levi Yoder over in Navar Ohio and when they found out that we knew them and then we knew that brother elim was going over there on Sunday of course we knew them and then we were going on to that Fellowship in in uh Indiana and so it's just so neat to see how that God ties us all together we're just worshiping the Lord and and giving him praise and thanking him for this message of truth that he has given to us friends I am thankful for this message of truth that God has given to us he is so so faithful I'm glad that he is working both to Will and to do of his good pleasure to bring us to our completed purpose in the earth that's right well did you enjoy your fellowship under the Tabernacle last week praise the [Applause] Lord did Charity give you a picture throw that up there something happened since you were there so now there's stud wall in the middle part there the uh the windows and the doors did not come in so that didn't get done yesterday like we had hoped but uh they'll be in this coming week they were uh they're probably sitting there now the truck was on its way um they they just didn't know when it would arrive but uh anyhow um if if the weather is good we'll probably try to have a a work day next week um I I think that there's maybe a shower so we'll have to coordinate around that but uh anyhow the the the Tabernacle project continues to move forward and we are very thankful for the giving there's been giving that has gone on while I was gone and we're so very grateful for that but if you brought an offering with you today we even came home with an offering for that project so that's good and uh if you brought an offering with you today we want to give you opportunity to give it uh Carter will you come and hold the offering bag today father I want to thank you for faithful people that give their tithe and offering I Want to Thank You Lord that you have provided for us all that we need we we don't always

house of the Lord isn't he good to us amen thank you Lord don't our mothers look beautiful today we're so thankful for them [Applause] it's a very a real blessing it's a it's a wonderful thing to have a Praying Mama to have a Godly mother and we're blessed in this assembly our children are blessed grandchildren are blessed because there are Godly women among us amen I was telling my family yesterday that when I first came around the message I got the impression from all preachers just about all preachers that that women were very very subservient and very low in God's economy I'm being honest it seemed like every message I heard was straightening the women out and the more I got to know about the brothers the more I realized why they were always slinging at the women because it kept the attention off of their life you don't have to say anything and I was so under that influence that one of the first Mother's Day sermons I preached at this church was dominating female and I stand by everything I said but I realize that that has been harped on quite a bit and now it's time to remember that we we are not taking our identification with Eve our sisters find their place in Mary's heart be it unto me according to your word now that doesn't mean that a sister can't get out of place but so can a brother and it's the word the word is what brings them I tell you you just put on the tape that that word will help bring us all back into our roles and it'll do it in a hurry and the biggest problem around this truth is not a dominating female I can assure you of that and I see some brothers who are uh just constantly harping and posting and harping and posting and I'm thinking to myself is there not a Godly woman anywhere in your life that you could lift up and say something positive about so we are extremely blessed in this little small Church to be able to say that we have so many Godly women and Godly mothers Among Us who are holding an example if you agree with me you can clap your hands and that being said we're not we're going at the end of the service after we have prayed for all the mothers we have a gift for every mother and uh also at the end of the service when we're dismissed those of you who who take a special gift you can come and get it but we'll leave everything in place uh for now but we need to find out who the oldest mother is in this house today so that we can honor her sister how old is Sister Gertrude 87 Sister Williams 87 she's older than you are by how many months four or five months maybe well that means that sister Gertrude is our oldest mother and we want to honor her and love her so sister Terry make sure you all pick pick a flower at the end of the service God Bless [Applause] you that's so sweet of you to mention I appreciate that uh uh and then we need to find the youngest mother and that's not almost mother that's mother and uh well it used to always be it used to always be Megan you know I don't know how how many years did you I mean you all must have been married at 12 had babies at 13 or something I don't know because it seems to me like you were the youngest mother forever aren't you about what 29 29 you will be 29 are there any Mothers here younger than 29 uh let me see would it be Sarah how old is Sarah 22 that seems so young she is our youngest mother so you be sure to get a flower when you go to leave 22 oh my let me tell you again that I have socks in my drawer that I still wear that are 22 years old so we're thankful and we're very glad they got to be with us for for Mother's Day and that brings us to uh another uh another long time longstanding award and that is for the mother who has the most children a biological children uh present in the house of God sister Teresa how many children do you have this morning eight is there anybody that has eight of their children here this morning other than sister Teresa so then let's congratulate her what a blessing I want you to think about it to have eight of your children in church with you on a regular basis I know Sarah is just visiting home but this is home and so to have that many of your family in church with you on regular basis that's powerful and we're so thankful so so blessed and grateful and then the last thing that we want to to honor this morning is the mother who has had the baptism of the Holy Ghost the longest sister Beverly how many years for you now 54 years Sister Williams for you what year what year do you you don't remember uh has well sister gerud has a flower so I would think then that the flower would go to sister Beverly so you be sure to get an orchid before you leave today 54 years of the baptism of the Holy Ghost now we don't have time for for gardening tips but I'm going to give you one whoever told you that it's hard to grow orchids told you wrong it's simply not hard to grow them at all we have some in our window that we have had for years years Sister Williams gave us one or two sister Rebecca gave us some and all you do is put two ice cubes a week and don't put it directly on the root just tuck it down in there you don't have to water it any more than that two ice cubes a week and lots of light and they'll Bloom over and over and over again Time After Time After Time so we thank God for all of the mothers they're all special to us and we're thankful for them amen let's

birthday and for those of you that don't know he was born in 1959 and his birthday Saturday happy birthday brother how many days a week do you work out let's let's be honest now we're in the house of God three okay about three days a week I think that's pretty incredible don't you three days a week let's give him a hand for that he's not going for beefy he's going for longevity amen and moving your body that's a good thing brother God bless you for that let's uh let's turn in our Bible this morning we have quite a bit to cover Psalm 31 I'm going to read the V first five verses of Psalm 31 in the Amplified and I'm doing that to save time I had both of them in my notes but uh I I've got something that's going to take a little bit of time toward the end so I want to get this in so that you have plenty of time to be with your families uh today uh I want you to know that brother brandham was not much for Mother's Day in itself he believed that it was kind of a commercial type thing and that it was abused and that people maybe would bring a bouquet to Mother on Mother's Day and forget her the rest of the time so he really encouraged people to honor their mother every day every day and be thankful for them but as I was reading this morning I had everything in place uh except this as I was reading this morning some things that brother brandham said about mama I W you to know I could not keep the tears from from falling and uh he he told us some things about why we're where we are today and for a lot of us it's because Mama Prayed you understand and when my mama was alive I used to always almost always sing on Mother's Day uh when Mama Prayed Heaven paid attention and I believe that I truly do I don't believe that mothers are the only ones who have that uh pull on God but brother brandom said he gave them a gift for this he gave gave them a gift to intercede for their children and I believe that with all my heart in verse one said in you oh Lord do I put my trust and seek Refuge let me never be put to shame or have my hope in you disappointed deliver me in your righteousness bow down your ear to me Deliver Me speedily be my rock of Refuge a strong Fortress to save me yes you are my rock and my Fortress can you say Amen therefore for your name's sake lead me and guide me draw me out of the net that they have laid secretly for me for You Are My Strength and my stronghold Hallelujah into your hands I commit my spirit you have redeemed me oh Lord the god of Truth and faithfulness can the Saints say amen I don't care how big the snare I don't have I don't care how deep the net there is a God we serve a God we know a God who can deliver us out of every snare of the enemy who can deliver us out of every pit that the enemy or our enemies would dig for us our hope is in the Lord he's a strong tower he's a mighty Rock he's a fortress do you believe that we're blessed Psalm 31: 10-2 said who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil let me say that when a father when a husband can trust his wife he has found a real treasure mistrust in a marriage brings dysfunction in a family do you hear what I'm saying when a wife can't trust her husband when a husband can't seem to trust his wife it brings dysfunction in the entire family so sometimes it's a wound that we carry that has nothing to do with our companion I need a little help it's one that we brought with us into the marriage and because of some wound or some hurt that we have experienced in life we bring that lack of trust into a marriage relationship and we bring dysfunction to our children so if you should somehow discern this morning that that your your heart cannot trust and feel safety in in your wife or in your husband ask the Lord to help you find that place it's a very important place in all relationships including friendships to know that someone has your best interest to know that you can really feel safe in a relationship is a very important element in the hour that we're living in I'll let you say Amen am she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life that doesn't mean she won't make mistakes but she will not do him harm or evil verse 25 of the same chapter strength and honor are her clothing and he shall rejoice in time to come she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness hear these words she lookth well to the ways of her household and eateth not the bread of idleness her children arise up and call her blessed her husband also and he praiseth her with his words with his actions he lifts her up he doesn't want to be responsible for pulling her down he wants to be responsible for lifting her up if you lift your wife up the mother of your children you're really benefiting your children because a woman in the despair of depression is not the kind of mother she was born to be that's right and a family has a responsibility in lifting that mother up so that she can be everything she needs to be for her children some of you your children are small but you will certainly see the importance of that and it's very important for a husband to speak words of affirmation to his wife in front of the children it's very important many daughters have done virtuously but thou excellest them all I'm never jealous when someone says I have the best wife there is because I know I do so I'm never jealous over them and every husband ought to feel that way and if we can't there's something wrong here here Solomon is speaking and he said there are many daughters who do virtuous thing but you're the top of the list and I feel that way today I feel like I got that one and we should feel that way me uh favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the Lord she shall be praised praised these are the same words in Hebrew that are used to lift up God come on so you're you're not stealing Glory from God when you lift up your mother when you lift up your wife and it must not be Beauty that's keeping everything together because you'll you'll one day wake up and and when she takes out her teeth and her glasses and her hearing aids and lays them on the on the on the nightstand it'll be true what George y used to say you'll have as much of her on one side of you as you do the other so it must not be about beauty it must be more than that some of you couldn't even laugh because you didn't get it you'll get it in about 20 minutes or something from now give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her in the gates may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated but I'm asking for your attention this morning I want to go first to a message called Mother's Day and there are several places in this message that I want to share with you today because they had such a deep impact on me when I read them again this morning mother is so great you know the first one that receives you in this life is your mother I know we know that but that hits us hard sometime when we think about it no one can touch you because you're conceived and she Bears you under her heart and she is the first to know you could we say truly know you and the first two in this life to hold you then when you're born she is one of the first hands that touch you and wipes back the tears out of your eyes she is the first one to Pat you and to love you and to CP over you in this life is your mother now I think that there is not enough honor that we could give to a mother mother is first with the child and she is a great responsibility of what that child will be will be based upon the way that mother starts that child on the path that it must travel I want you to think with me just a moment of what a heavy responsibility is laid on the woman yes it's not laid exactly like that on the father it's laid particularly hard on the shoulders of the mother because she has the time with the child this is why brother brandham did not encourage women to have jobs outside of the home so that she could spend stay with me because she could spend all that time that quality time while they were young so that she could love them and nurture them and teach them let me say that it was never to be the responsibility of the government to educate our children it was always to be our responsibility to do that and the mother responsibility the most it was to fall on her she that that child will hear his first his or her first Bible story from a mother amen we don't have Sunday School in this church and the reason why we don't is simply because we believe that it's not someone else's responsibility to teach your children the beginning stages of the faith it's your responsibility and a mother a woman should take that so heavy because you know it's not like a plant I'm going to preach a little bit it's not like a green plant you know everybody these last few years uh have just gone crazy over house plants and it's fun to start with and it gives you a great Instagram moment and you can post all the green but after a while you may get tired of those plants and I don't know how many have died on the Shelf because it oh that was a lot of laughter that was too much laughter if someone wasn't relating to it they die someone told me they said I like succulents because they don't ever have to be watered are you kidding every living plant has to be watered at some point and some more than others and people will buy one and they don't even know the instructions and they'll just treat it anyway don't Google don't and they wonder why it doesn't survive because you don't take up time you can't treat your children like that you know people will take on a hobby or even sometimes they'll take on the responsibility of helping somebody else with their kids and uh then they grow tired of that they babysitting for instance you know when they when their arm babies like April's got an arm arm full they're not as much trouble for a babysitter but when they get a little bit older when they can talk back when they can talk brother that's something to get over right there I thought the other day as Ezekiel was talking 90 miles a minute is that right brother Robert you all had him for the night 9 miles a minute and he was going into all kinds of things and I thought to myself all for the day that all he said was mama and you're sitting there thinking oh I wish he could put a sentence together and the next thing you know they can and they don't hush you can't put them away like a hobby they're your responsibility until they're grown yes sir so a mother who takes takes her responsibility serious no wonder the Bible said she ought to get some praise she ought to get some recognition brother brandom goes on to say that Mother starts that child on the path that it must travel mother has the responsibility from God to place that child on the right Road and I think that's why mothers has a special touch now that's through paragraph 32 let's keep moving paragraph 34 you know a man like Moses if I could credit anything to his character it was because he had a godsent mother he's talking about the greatest prophet of the Old Testament and he's saying that much of what he accomplished could be credited to a mother a godsent mother he said you know it was she that had prayed yoked and had longed for this baby and when he was born she was the one who CED him and cuddled him and built the ark and placed him in the bull rushes when her poor with her poor when her poor heart breaking her only little baby and it was the most outstanding little chump that was in all the world world and how a mother likes any baby but to see this special little fellow and then in her heart she knew that he was born for a purpose don't you understand that and then to take him and place him into the very den of crocodiles out into the river by faith she did that the title of this message today is a real mother's faith faith that can ground a plane how many of you know where that comes from faith that can ground a plane and then in her heart she knew that he was born for a purpose uh by faith she did that knowing that God was able to take care of him and to summarize the love of a mother and the action of the character of her faith I like that for Faith does not Place itself upon the shifting SS of what it can see Faith rests solemnly upon the UN unmovable Rock of God's Eternal Word brother that's powerful statement to make she didn't have faith in faith she had faith in God her faith wasn't in Good Luck it wasn't in faith her faith was in the Eternal promise of God's word and she knew that God would fulfill his purpose in the life of her son if she was faithful to stir him to steer Him to guide him to nourish him for by Faith said the scripture she did this and faith can take its stand on the rock that the waves are beating the foundations out and look straight into the face of death and know that it'll be just in a little bit but faith can look across the sea to him that said I am the resurrection and life and fail to even hear listen What Faith Can Do faith can look out over the sea and fail to hear the waves are dashing because Faith doesn't look at the circumstances Faith looks at the Rock and who do we know that has more of that rock kind of Faith than a Godly mother she has to look and see as her children get older they start making wrong choices and uh you know there used to be a time that they tried to hide things from mother but there's such a boldness and a brassiness on this generation that they don't even try to hide their Dirty Deeds from their Godly mother anymore come on they come to Mama's House dressed anyway way uh and they come acting anyway and they come with everything pierced that can be pierced and if that's not bad enough they post it all on Facebook so mother has to see son and daughter with a with a mixed drink in their hand come on that's not respect somebody said well I want to be me and I don't want to hide it look folks that's too hard on a mother it's not right she has to know all of that and then she has to make up her mind I'm not looking at The Dashing waves I'm not listening at what circumstances are telling me I'm looking at a promise that God has given me my children how many mothers in this house and streaming this service refuse to see and hear the waves around them dashing in other direction and you're you're choosing to keep your faith anchored on the Rock of Ages because you believe that God will bring your children to you now let me say I understand that everyone in this room didn't have that kind of mother but I refuse to to give in a woke society that says you've got to tiptoe around all the different situations in the house I can't do that anymore because I see it as a part of a liberal agenda and you got to ask you got to make sure you got to you got to you've got to make sure that that someone who didn't have that kind of mother is okay look folk you're where you are today because of God's grace if mother didn't help you get to where you are you have no one else to think but him and the Bible tells us he'll be a mother to us he's a mother to the motherless and a father to the fatherless and the reality is we can't let our mother issues affect us in this hour we got to say I know my mother did about the best that she was capable of doing but his amazing grace that brought me this far come on now let's go on that's the kind of faith that Moses mother had she taught him and she reared him in the Palace of pharaoh which was a miracle wasn't it Supernatural teaching him that he was born for a purpose you and I as parents have that responsibility that's right somebody said well uh are all children born for a purpose you're mighty right they are you may not know what the purpose is but it's not wrong for you to say son you were born for a purpose you're going to have to discover from God what that purpose is and fulfill it when you're old enough to do such a thing as that daughter you are born for a purpose and I want you to know that we are blessed we're blessed today when I look out over this room I say we are extremely blessed she was teaching him that he was born for a purpose that Jehovah had answered her prayer she could not have had he could not have had a better teacher that's what helped mold the character that Moses was what mother mother's Faith remember brother brandham calls the The Fifth Gospel Matthew Mark Luke John and mother because by the time a child is old enough to read he's had more of mother in him more influence of mother than he has of Matthew Mark Luke and John it's the truth I want to go on to paragraph 42 but in the face of all that one day he made a statement like this and I'm going to tell you who he is he is Abraham Lincoln brother Brandon was talking about Abraham Lincoln in the paragraphs before this and he said I consider him to be one of the greatest presidents of the United States of America and he talked about his humble beginning and some of his suffering some of the things that he'd been through and he said but in the face of all that one day he made a statement like this he said if there could be any good thing found in me it's because of a Godly mother that raised him to serve the Lord now she knew he had a purpose and she spoke life into him because of that purpose you see a child listens to its mother some little touch about that mother that a child will listen to when it's hurt it'll go to the mother for consolation before it'll go to the father it's natural behavior in most cases and sometimes daddies have a hard time with that don't it's nothing personal it's a gift that God gives a mother she has a gift given to her from God to be that nurturing soul that nurturing spirit for that child they'll come to you when it's time for the keys but mama's the one most of the time that's going to kiss the boo boos I didn't bring the quotation but in this sermon just before brother brandham was talking about Abraham Lincoln he said there's a woman here he said I don't want to hurt you sister he said but but I want to tell this story she has a son who's an alcoholic and she said he goes off on the weekend and gets so drunk that he don't hardly know who he is I'm paraphrasing a little bit but he doesn't hardly know who he is and he said and when he gets to to thinking about what he's done he goes home to Mama he said he goes in and he crawls in Mama's bed wraps his arms around his mother and a grown man and finds his consolation there even in his condition he realizes that Mama is the one that's holding on to God for him and he feels that affection for her even in that in that condition then he goes on to talk about Abraham Lincoln and then he says because she was first with it you know and there's some gift that God gives a mother to be that way I mean a real mother and I'm talking about the faith of a real mother brother brandham said having a baby doesn't make a woman a mother he said I saw in the news about a woman who threw her baby over the bridge that's not a mother that's a woman who had a baby so it wasn't just having a baby that makes a woman a mother it's the way she raises her children and the way she speaks life into them I'm so thankful that that God has given some in this house and around the world in this message a baby to raise that didn't come from their body but in the eyes of God God they're more a mother than the one who birthed the child and so you don't have to feel any less you're fulfilling a very important role and this proves that God gave you the gift to do it that it's not biological it's a gift from God to be able to nurture now I believe that mothers are honorable and and godly but I believe such as Mother's Days like this is it make a lot of money out of flowers and things but Mother's Day should be every day not to send her a bunch of flowers on Mother's Day do that it's okay to do that but to love her and care for her 365 days and nights through the year but of course the commercial world has a great hold in all things like this and it depre appreci mother oh well last Mother's Day I sent her a bunch of flowers I read this paragraph to my wife this morning and I sobbed I could hardly get it out he said she would appreciate a whole lot more than the bouquet of flowers just sit down and talk to her just a little bit how many mothers would so appreciate a conversation instead of saying I've heard that you've already told me that mother I don't need to hear that anymore how wonderful it would be to just sit down and talk to her just a little bit write her a line now people don't write letters it seems anymore but you could shoot her a text someone said that's impersonal let me tell you something a mother would appreciate hearing from you send her a corny joke send her an emoji send her a meme come on nobody spends money on Hallmark cards anymore it seems do what you can to let her know I'm here for you I might not be always in in sight but I'm here Pat her on the shoulder kiss her on the cheek hear me you're never too big you're never too old to kiss your mother on the cheek and we should do it it'll go a lot farther tell her that you love her it'll go a lot farther than all the flowers that you could buy from the Florest brother random said that's true I want you to look at Deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 6 and 7 and these these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them when thou sest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way and when thou liest down and when thou risest up let me ask you a question when are you supposed to talk to your children about the things of God it sounds to me like all times it sounds to me Samantha like a walk is a good time to talk to your kids I'm referring to a little text that she sent this week so encouraging and uh she asked a question and got reminded that Pastor has said that several times lately you say well that that might have made her feel terrible no it made her feel amazing and maybe she didn't tell tell him she told me so now she's outed it made her feel amazing it thrilled her because to know that your children are listening in church listen God didn't give you those children so you can sit outside and use them as an excuse not to be in the house God didn't give you those children to send them to church brother Brandon was against that kind of behavior and so am I S sending your children to no you be there and you bring them there and you make sure they're there and that doesn't just go from mothers the men of God you know God's men they want to take back masculinity and they want to they want to be the kind of man that they ought to be then the way to do that as a Godly Man is to set the example don't come on a Saturday night and say to your wife are we going to church tomorrow you come in the room and say we're going to be a church tomorrow somebody said what if they're not born again that's every more the reason to gather in his name until he gets a hold of your heart so when are we to teach our children all the time when you sit down talk about the Lord when you walk by the way talk about the Lord when you lie down talk about the Lord and when you get up talk about the Lord these Commandments that word commandment is instruction and it's our responsibility to speak of the instructions of the Lord to our children now let me ask you a question a Dad is working at least 40 hours a week and sometime a whole lot more that doesn't negate his responsibility to speak to his children about the Lord I know men even in this house that not only work a full-time job but bear a big part in the responsibility to homeschool their children I want to tell you that's a real dad you know who you are that's a real dad one that will come home after a long day of work and still take the responsibility of helping to homeschool the children my I hope I remember to mention that again on Father's Day it's commendable it's admirable it's worth celebrating but most of that responsibility falls on a mother because she's home and she's with her children day in and day out and I want you to know something you need to know that you can carry through and follow through on your responsibility to your own children before you take on the responsibility of educating other people's children it's very important I know we share I know we're a village I know we stand up for one another and we help one another along the way but I also want you to understand that that the load of that is on you and you should be praised you should be commended for taking that responsibility if you let the world do it they may come home and tell you I'm a cat and that's when you tell them cats live in the yard not in the house I read an article about a y young person who said this thing he got this on him at school he didn't get that on him at home he got that devil on him in a public school surrounding and he come home and he's a cat and he's bought him a costume and he's dressed and they call him furries don't get sister Beth poke started on that she she was shocked to find out it was a real thing Furies you got boys you got girls and you got Furies and they think they're animals and this one boy insisted on a litter box and he wasn't the only one in that house that had a mental problem evidently mother did too cuz she bought him a litter box I'm going to tell you something I think the line ought to be drawn I don't see a Godly mother doing that come on and so you if you send them to Egypt they're going to be raised like Egyptians I've been saying that for for 40 years well that's not directed at anybody that's just nothing but the truth you know in this day when this scripture was spoken it was taught to the to the Jewish women the Hebrew women it it's your responsibility to teach these things to your children and I used to always say as an example they didn't get all the children together after escaping Egypt and put them on a school bus and send them back down to Egypt to get their education and then wait on them to come home every day no when God delivered them out of Egypt they were free from that stuff I'm thankful today for every one of you sisters who serve in the public school system you're the only hope you don't have to be you don't have to be a Jesus nut you don't have to break laws and rules all you have to do is shine amen you don't have to proide or evangelize you just shine over there because your dress and the way you conduct yourself the way you treat people will shine to a world that is so dark and so lost if you can you do the you do the teaching Mother if you can you bear that responsibility and for those of you who do you you are to be praised a husband ought to come home and say to his wife thank you so much you're you're not just loving our children in word but you're giving everything everything it's not easy I've seen my wife spending hours not with our children after she had taught our children spend hours trying to learn the concept of geometry algebra that they were going to need the next day she had to learn it for herself because she had to teach it the next day that's commendable and that's what people have to do in a situation like that so we're talking all the time to about the things of the Lord now I want to take a section of this sermon this morning the time I have and I want to talk about the threefold prophetic purpose of prayer because one of the biggest things that a mother can do for her children is to pray for them and the song said that prayer is more powerful than an atomic bomb brother brandham said that about prayer in general that it's the most powerful weapon known to man prayer and prayer is not just a privilege it's a responsibility I want to say that again to all of you brother and sister Mama and Dad whoever you are prayer is not just a blessing and a privilege it's not a Santa Claus list it's not just begging for your wants and needs but prayer has a purpose and as I see it in the scripture there are many purposes of prayer but I'm not talking about just generic prayer I'm talking about prophetic prayer prophetic prayer is praying with a spiritual Insight letting God speak to you as you pray let him direct your thoughts as you pray this is not witchcraft prayer witchcraft prayers are manipulation and we're still praying them sometime when you pray a prayer against someone's will and you pray for their will to be changed it's manipulation the most prayer that you can pray in that direction is that they would come to their senses and receive the Lord's salvation because that changes a lot of things but you have you have no business in their will so if you're praying to change somebody's will back off of that that's not a that's not a strategic or prophetic prayer it's a prayer of manipulation when you look at a person or a situation and you decide on your own how things ought to go listen to me and you pray accordingly that's not a holy spirit driven prayer it's a manipulative prayer it's actually Witchcraft and it's not to take place in the body of Christ you and I may think we know what would be best and then they come and ask us sometime what would we best what would be best and we we're speechless well I don't know do what you want to do do what you think you should do after we've spent 30 minutes in prayer telling God to make them do what we wanted them to do that's not how prayer Works prayer especially prophetic prayer is to discover the mind of God you want to pray the mind of God because we know that whatever Heaven is binding we have authority to bind on the earth and whatever Heaven is loosing we have power to loose that on the earth we're not controlling heaven heaven is controlling us if we yield to the leadership of Eternity and so the spirit of God will direct your prayer and lead your prayer uh brother gy understands and appreciates that because that's how God uses him often times and uses some of you many of you that way you start praying for somebody and and the Very words that come out of your mouth are directional words God is using that prayer to give them insight you're just praying but God is putting words he's creating words in your mouth and you don't realize the prophetic power that releasing that that Revelation and you can pray that over your children I believe with all my heart that yoked did that I believe she laid hands on that little baby's head and prayed him into his purpose and therefore she didn't have to worry about a crocodile because she knew there weren't enough crocodiles in the Nile River to keep him from meeting his purpose if you have thoroughly covered your children with prayer you don't have to worry there's not enough crocodiles in the river to get them out of their purpose forever they may be pulled in One Direction or the other the Bible said raise up a child train a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart now that the King James fails I know there are critics watching who say see he he's bashing the King James no in most cases it's the B Most Blessed and most accurate but that is really a little different translation from what the original language says there if you were to take that from the original it doesn't say train up a child and he'll never get away from that training when he's old he'll come back it actually says and while he is growing old train up a child in the way he should go and while he is growing old he will not depart from it so God has a time he has a season he has a place for your children I'm talking to mothers for just a moment here mama I don't care where they are right now you may be sitting here thinking that you know he could have sent me a flower she could could have done such and such and such instead she's off with her husband's mother or some other person's mother and they missed their opportunity to be with me I agree it seems unfair but I want you to know it doesn't matter where they are they may be somewhere nursing the biggest hangover of their life this morning they might not have wanted you to see them looking like they look this morning but I want you to know that if you have thoroughly covered them in prayer and you are in in agreement with God's purposes for their life and you have prophesied that into eternity they you may never see them brother you don't have to see them to have great influence in their life because a mother has that gift to be able to pray prophetically if you'll yield to it and and I want you to know Destinies are corrected when a Godly mother stands in faith she cannot be moved by what she sees she can can not be moved by what she hears she's got to have her faith anchored on the solid rock and no matter how they live or what they do or what they say when they're away from God their words can be so harsh and so cutting and if a mother lets her heart be wounded by that she'll loosen her grip on her faith don't you you pray I pray for you right now that God God would so protect your heart and so Shield your heart that you would realize that it's not your children it's a spirit that has taken a hold of them they're not in Rebellion against you they're in Rebellion against God and God knows how to get them he knows how to draw them to hisself you don't be moved by what you see or he keep your faith anchored in that Solid Rock and God knows how amen so I I I want to get to this I chose three there could be many more prophetic purposes of prayer I chose three because of Ecclesiastes 4:12 and if one Prevail against him two shall withstand him and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken I want you to know there's power there's power in agreement and there's power when when any two or more agree and this talks to us about uh the the authority of three the power of three and so I chose three and uh here it is in Ezekiel I want to show you the three things in Ezekiel chap 22 verse 30 and 31 some will recognize this teaching from a from a prayer meeting that we did some years ago in the daytime and I sought A man among them them that should make up the Hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that I should not destroy it and what does he say but I found none therefore have I poured out my indignation upon them I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way have I recompensed upon their heads sayeth the Lord God I don't have to tell you this morning how how powerful the book of of Ezekiel is Ezekiel was an interesting prophet he carried a particular anointing and there are there are things in the Book of Ezekiel that are coming to pass sometimes it's like reading the newspaper or hearing the news especially pertaining to the nation of Israel Ezekiel was given stay with me he was given a particular anointing to prophesy even into our day I want you to think about that a prophet uh misunderstood in his own generation and yet his word still coming to pass today and he said I sought for a man among them I sought for someone there's neither male nor female with God I'm using this for mothers but I want you to know every man woman boy or girl has a responsibility in prayer I said a responsibility the church isn't praying enough if we were praying enough we would seem even more accomplished it wouldn't be behind the scenes then did you know that true prayer among us if it should catch out like a fire among us we would pull the things that God is doing behind the scene we'd pull it right out in the open where we could see it how many of you'd like to see some oldfashioned Deliverance Prayer is what moves God in certain directions you're not directing God but prayer gives God Liberty he is a gentleman he's not going to break in on your agenda but when you pray for his agenda to be done not my will sir but thy will be done I want to tell you something there are too many of us in this room that most of our prayers are for ourselves now that's not intercession that's just straight out selfishness come on and when I say that I don't mean God make me what I ought to be I mean Lord bless this and bless that and do this and do that and do the other and help me in mine let me tell you something we not only have a responsibility to our own but we have a responsibility to the body I'm preaching you might not be listening but I'm preaching now number one one one of the three-fold prophetic purposes of prayer is to I call it hedge building to build a hedge he said I sought for a man among them that should make up the Hedge a hedge is a protective wall that keeps enemies out the word hedge means to surround with a fence or a wall to protect to set anyone who is in trouble distress or danger in a safe place to keep out of the enemies excuse me to keep out the enemies of the vineyard the flock the house the city the family the church God gives us a responsibility in prophetic prayer to build up a hedge to raise up a hedge because the enemy desires to tear down every hedge he wants to leave the body defenseless he wants to leave leave us entirely vulnerable to the spirit of the age it's up to the prayer warriors it's up to mothers to do this in their own family I'm going to drink some water while you pinch yourself to stay awake it's up to mothers to build Hedges that's why you need to be at home it's up to mothers to build Hedges of protection around their families now that doesn't mean dad has no responsibility but remember mother has a gift if mother will yield to that gift we're Walling something in and when we hedge something in we're shutting something out Job chapter 1 9 and 10 then Satan answered the Lord and said that job fear God for not Hast not thou made a hedge about him God is a hedge Builder it's up to you and I to keep it in place do you hear that and about the house and about all that he hath on every side thou Hast blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land so it was God who built a hedge around job but the enemy's desire was to come in and you know God led him God led him and job and his distraction he got distracted I know we talk about some of the faithful words that come out of his mouth we talk about the fact that you know he oh that I could write that my redeemer liveth and we know that he said to his wife she told him just Curse God and die he said you talk like a foolish woman but I want you to know he his afflictions distracted him he needed somebody to help build keep the Hedge in place to to raise it up when the Hedge is broken down it allows satanic harassment in and around those areas that especially needs spiritual protection and a mother has a particular responsibility as the children are growing up to keep that hedge in place she has a responsibility I'm going to wait on you she has a responsibility to monitor what her children put before their eyes your eye gate is one of one of the most powerful Gates into your soul the eye gate and you've got to guard that eye gate at all cost yes sir and you know just because they're too young to understand what you're watching doesn't mean that it doesn't have an influence over them in another realm it certainly does you let one person disrespect the things of God you let one person think it's all right to stand in here and talk when the service is dismissed you let one person think they're the exception to the rule and the next thing you know somebody else will do it and somebody else will do it because they justified in their mind by saying she does it I want you to know we wouldn't have near the trouble we have if we wouldn't worry about what somebody else gets by with if we just worry about hearing the Lord for ourselves and if we'd worry about making sure the Hedge is is secure around those we love our responsibility doesn't stop with our house it goes to our extended family help me now and it goes to the body of Christ it goes to nhrm it goes to New Hope Revival ministries we're raising up and keeping a hedge in place that God is the one who built it it was his promise to keep our children but it's our responsibility to make sure you sit them down in a room where you're playing I'm going to I'm going to just hit this I'm not going to be with nobody the rest of the day I'm just going home with mine I'm not going to be fellowshipping with anybody the rest of the day so I'm just going to say what needs to be said this morning and go home and sit by myself so I don't need your handshake this morning brother the truth is the truth we set them down in front or allowed them to play in a room where we're watching something that shouldn't be watched playing a game that we shouldn't play doing something that we shouldn't do reading some old True Crime book or some uh you know Grisham or Clancy or or what's the weird one the horer king we sit in a room and read some kind of stuff like that and we don't realize that in the room those kinds of influences emit something let me tell you something you let one person in a house uh spend time in pornography and it releases a spirit over the entire house you see we don't know enough about how that other realm operates but once we do we'll become a little fanatical about it I'm a little bit fanatical about it I understand one person's influence over another I understand how Spirits call out and cry out brother brandom tried to teach us that he said what's that well I said that Spirit on that person there is calling out to this other person over here who has the same problem he's calling in for reinforcements now you know if demons can call in reinforcements then we ought to have a little authority to do such a thing Lord I need some reinforcements in here I need some amens in here I need some angels help in here and I'm not commanding angels I'm asking the Lord you the Lord he's the Lord of hosts he's the one who commands Angel armies Lord I'm asking you if it Be Your Will and according to your plan send me some of my angels send me some help I have a responsibility here to to build this hedge to make sure Ecclesiastes 108 he that dith the pit I'm hurrying he that dith the pit shall fall into it and who so break a hedge a serpent shall bite in you really want to dig a pit for somebody else you really want to sneak in and tear somebody else's heads down you really want people to get what they deserve I've heard Christian people say people that I know and love say well he just getting what he deserves she's just getting what she deserves look bud what if you did look what if you what if you did what if if you got what you deserved let me tell you something God didn't call you uh to be that kind of a you know uh gainsayer he called you to be someone who helps build up a hedge around them I'm driving back forces of the enemy in the name of Jesus Christ I'm commanding you to take your hands off of my children I'm command come on somebody said you'll sound like a nut well I didn't tell you to get on street corner and do it I didn't tell you to stand out by the side of the road and do it you do it by by yourself if you have to and that's why you need to be able to pray in another tongue you need to yield to that kind of a thing because sometimes we're so emotionally involved in a situation we don't know what to say we're almost embarrassed to pray you let the spirit woo take that you [Applause] preachers you let the spirit begin to intercede I tell you he never misses the mark he knows what we need amen don't don't dig a pit don't try to break somebody else's hedge down Isaiah 55 and now go to I will tell you what I will do to my Vineyard I will take away the Hedge thereof it shall be eaten up and break down the wall thereof and it shall be trotten down this is God telling us through the prophet Isaiah I'm about to deal with Israel and the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take down the Hedge oh and I'm going to allow the enemy to come in and eat up the grapes so this is the importance of keeping a hedge in place and we do that with prophetic prayer Psalm 30 excuse me Psalm 812 why hast thou then broken down her hedges so that they all which pass by the way do pluck her we've got a Vineyard to protect we've got fruit to hold on to come on is there anybody in here that raised your children and wanted them to go I hear people ignorantly saying stupid things I hear people sometimes saying well they'll never be able to appreciate what it means to find the grace of God unless they go out there and sin sleep around and do the thing you have no more confidence in your God than that don't you know that God is able if you keep the Hedge up he's able to make sure they don't even fall into the desire for the things of the world you raise them to be worshippers that's right these little bitty children raise them to be worshippers and rebuke anybody that tells you they don't know what they're doing if you believe what I believe you'll believe that way before we were where we are we were in the presence of God in his mind at least dancing before him at least in his mind sir right the Book of Job doesn't say in his mind but at least we're going to say in his mind we came from a place of Praise so when your little children find that place of worship they're just actually fulfilling and doing what they were sent here to do what they were created to do in the first place and if they have Liberty now by the grace of God they don't have to lose it when they're teenagers it's hard it's hard you you can't raise them any way you want to and then bring them to a place like this and expect a place like this to fix everything no in fact what we can do and the only thing we can do sometime is say Lord I have made some big old mistakes but I want you to redeem the time forgive me for my slackness if there was slackness on my part forgive me Lord and redeem the time I want my children programmed by the spirit to worship God to serve God we sing they that wait upon the Lord that doesn't mean sit and do nothing that word wait means to serve those who serve God those who serve him waiting on the promise you don't you don't wait till the promise comes to praise him you serve him until the promise becomes a reality so we're wall build ERS we're hedge repairers do you understand we there's always going to be Nehemiah chapter 4 I'm not going to read it for time verses 6-9 but it talks about a sand balad and a Tobias I want you to know there's always going to be sand balads and Tobias that seek out the gaps or the breaches in the wall which provide Avenues or ways for the enemy to enter the city but that's all right because there's always going to be a holy ghost intercessor man or woman there's always going to be some Watchman on the wall man or woman who are praying to repair those breaches to raise up those broken down walls and then it goes on and let me say this we must be able to recognize the neglected and broken down areas that Satan has used to gain access into our lives and be willing to invest our time in prayer and prophetic decreeing of the word to repair and to rebuild the the hedges and the walls that God has put in place the prophet said I'm looking for a man among them to make up the Hedge and to do what to stand in the Gap we need gap standers we need people who will find the vulnerability in the wall mothers too who find the vulnerability in the wall and you go stand in it you go put your finger in the in the in the hole in the Dyke you'll go find where it's leaking out and you'll go plug it up and you'll put your faith there I'm putting my faith yeaha I'm putting my faith in that hole I'm putting my faith in that Gap I'm not going to see it and and celebrate it I'm going to go stand in it sometimes we have a problem when we see the the places of of of Gap we have a tendency to call attention to it with gossip that's not what a gap standard does a gap Stander is not someone who sees a gap and goes pointing at it hey hey hey hey look here look at this place where they're vulnerable where they're not doing what they're supposed to do no there are too many people I've said this many times I believe there's a spirit behind it there are too many people that'll step over a piece of trash there's too many people I thank God we don't have this much snow there's too many people that will shovel the sow snow off their stoop that they share with the neighbor there's too many people that'll cut their grass and they get down there to the road where the where the yards kind of come close and they wouldn't dare think of I'm not telling you to cut your neighbor's yard but if you share a little space down there by the mailbox it wouldn't hurt you to be the one there's a spirit behind some of those behaviors in a house when you drop something pick it up don't wait on Mama I'll give Mama a little help don't wait on Mama to pick it up you pick it up you know I'm going to say this I'll get in trouble all my kids we you know we've put Benjamin up the hill with his little wife in life and the other three were going to camp and you know what my wife went through the house and she did the most amazing thorough cleaning of the house and we found out that you don't even have to do it every day if the kids are gone I wipe down my counter she wiped down hers and and the girls I can see them sometime they look so weary cuz they help a lot they do they help a lot but they do look sometimes weary doing it and they didn't like it when we told them they come home they did not like it when we told them you know why because no nobody left anything on the dining room even even mother and I have to be honest my wife does sometime I got to be real real cuz my girls are listening sometimes mama has so much to do that sometimes she'll leave something on the dining room table but we found out that it's easy to keep up with your own things and put your own things away when you don't have to be busy putting somebody else's things away come on mhm I just said recently to to one of them you would you please move such a that's not mine I said I don't I don't care they were kidding thankfully and they got it done we we there's Spirits behind that kind of behavior so if you see something that needs to be picked up pick it up if you have to if you have to get out and move a scooter to drive why don't you go ahead and put it in a safe place it's aggravating believe me I know I know it used to bother Nathan still does us for people to leave things well they just do it and they're going to folks leave their dishes we used to have folks come over and stay at our house and still do sometime and oh my goodness the things they leave I hope I hope one of the kiners listens to this we sometimes have to box their stuff up in a box and send it to them there's so much of it it won't go in an envelope it's got to be boxed up you got to learn to keep up with your stuff naturally and spiritually we've got to learn we're not celebrating someone's lack where they've let the bar down we're going over and finding that spot putting oursel right in the midst in Hebrew a gap represents a rupture or a breach there's a breach in the wall we need a Godly mother we need a Godly Mama to go stand in that breach of the wall and hold up that spot I tell you the enemy that's been running in and out of there when he looks up and sees a mama's Faith standing there he'll tuck his head and tail when heav when Mama Prayed Heaven pays attention when a with the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man or a righteous woman availeth much from a military context it's known that a besieging army would continuously attack a specific place in the wall of a city and then with United Force the enemy uh Army would rush the wall causing a breach or a break first they would weaken that spot Ram it and RAM it and that how the devil does RAM it and RAM brother Shel I'm having hard time following your Mother's Day May I'm sorry I'm trying to get everybody in here the enemy will RAM and RAM and RAM and RAM and RAM the wall he'll shake the mortar out of its place that's the place he's going to come in that's a place you and I need to be standing come on don't you get upset with me if if I say to somebody you need to correct something don't you be upset with me that's part of my responsibility because if the enemy can't get this church one way he'll get us another if he can't attack us one way he'll attack us another and he'll use compromise in this hour he'll let a Spirit come right in here Among Us and it'll catch on I'm telling you it'll catch on you let those skirts get shorter and shorter and that thing will catch on with somebody else if it's my responsibility I'm going to be a gap Stander if it hair lips the devil and bankrupts hell and if I can if if God will let me I can live without your tithe if your tithe is that important to you that you will try to control what somebody says up here God knows how to stretch it don't he he stretched it for you it's recorded in history that in this situation often often one or more soldiers would have the responsibility to sacrifice their lives by physically standing in the breach and closing the Gap the enemy had made in the wall in the best case scenario the enemy would be turned back or at the least significantly slowed down by soldiers who are standing in the Gap a gap standing Soldier was highly respected though somewhat rare and a name that was sought Out Among the bra braest of soldiers God needs some folks families need some mamas there's things that go on in your home sometimes sister that you can't tell anybody but you can tell him it's not God's will for wives to be mistreated and abused that's not godly come on sometimes things go on like that that nobody can know can't be told but you let a Godly mother go find the place cuz she realizes that everything that goes on in that home is going to affect those children what if they don't hear it I tell you it will affect them because it's a spirit that's right it'll affect them in their bedrooms you send them away I know parents that put their kids with earphones on and put them in a room so they can fight well that's nice of you to go to all that trouble but while you're doing all of that you could just forgive one another and get it worked out if you've got time to go put your kids in one room and give them headphones so you can yell you've got time to go one way and send him another way and pray it through there's going to be conflict there is we can make a difference through prayer I've got to move on the third is we're to fill the cup with prayer we are to make up the Hedge to make sure that the Hedge is repaired we are to stand in the Gap when we can't build it back we can stand in the Gap and make sure the enemy doesn't get through it on our watch and then we have a responsibility because the cup of God's indignation is ever filling the cup of God's Wrath is ever filling and we have a responsibility to fill the cup with prayer before the before the Lord's indignation cup is filled and other words we have the ability to hold back the Judgment of God while our families get in and we do that by filling up the cup with prayer and praise we fill up the bolds with prayer while the enemy's cup you know he's making sure that the cup of indignation God's indignation is filling up the cup of God's Wrath we have a responsibility to kind of work against that Revelation 58 and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials and that word golden vile there is translated from a bowl or a shallow cup full of odors full of incense which are the prayers of the Saints did you you know that those Elders that sit and stand Before the Throne have vials or bowls that are filled with the prayers of saints and they ever rise like incense Before the Throne of God you think your little prayer down here don't matter well I want you to know it's raising out of a bowl like incense in the hands of 4 and 20 ERS the lamb could not forget you if he wanted to because your prayers precede you to the throne and they're Rising we're in a race to fill up the cup of prayer before God's Cup of Wrath is filled up Psalm 141:2 let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice Luke 1:9 and 10 according to the custom of the priest off office his lot was to burn incense when he went into the Temple of the Lord talking about Zacharias and the whole multitude of the people were praying without at the time of incense the priests were not left alone to do their job hello it wasn't just in the hands of the preacher to do the praying and the praising while that while that priest was offering that incense to the Lord as a sweet smelling sa the people were were without and they were raising up up their prayers and their praise to God and they were doing it at the same time the priest was doing his thing we have a responsibility yes sir you can find that in fact you can find that in Revelation 8 if you look down to verse four and the smoke of the incense this is this is when he's talking about the seventh seal and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angel's hand in and the angel took the sensor and filled it with fire of the Altar and cast it into the Earth and there were voices and thunderings and Lightnings and earthquakes and the Seven Angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound I want you to know that your prayers not only work in this realm they have great authority of course in another realm and they represent themselves Before the Throne of God now there's a lot more that I could say and would say and and may say on that subject subject but I want to I want to come to a close by this I don't believe there's any impossibility when a mother a real mother's prayer is being offered to God I think God can do things I believe God can do things that the world would call impossible and I think that God would hold all kinds of things in place do all kinds of unusual things that would affect uh the world itself to get your prayer answered I believe mothers are Given that special gift of faith to pray for their children and nobody else can take their place in doing it we join our faith with theirs I want to I want to read you a story I I'm doing it this way because I want to get the details I want to tell you that a real mother's faith can ground a plane how many of you know that a real mother's faith can bring a storm that causes an airplane not to take off that sends a prophet down through downtown Memphis puts him at the right place at the right time can I read this to you in paragraph 98 of a of a message called desperations Hannah I want you to listen to this if you miss the rest don't miss this part Hannah a barren woman in the Bible she wanted a son and she got to fasting for him and she fasted and prayed until even the priest at the temple thought she was drunk can you imagine can you imagine being in such a place of intercession that only your lips moved I've been there some of you been there that only your lips moved but your there was no sound coming out your heart was reaching out to God she was so desperate she'd been so mocked and maligned and she was so desperate before God she had prayed and prayed and prayed this wasn't her first time of praying she had prayed and prayed and prayed and this time she felt in fell into so much desperation BR said she was in so much desperation let's go on with the rest of the women watching what kind of Bonnet the other one had wore and you know how it goes and the other one seeing what kind of clothes they had on and talking about the things going on on the farm you know folks can be silly folks can be really silly men can be really silly women women can be really silly don't matter what kind of Bonnet somebody else wears Benjamin is not in here but oh yes that grandbaby is going to wear a bonnet at least once in her life her mama said so and her p pap said so you don't have to do it every day but I want to see one Bonnet owner women uh you know word about some little something like that but not Hannah she stepped right through the whole crowd went to the altar she'd been fasting she wanted her reproach taken away it was a shame it was hanging on her that she couldn't have any children what a difference it is today it's almost a reproach to have a child you know you hear women sometime in this Society hopefully not in a holy ghost filed church but you hear women say I don't really I mean I really don't want to because I don't want to ruin my figure H what a difference it is today almost a reproach to have a child then it was a reproach not to have one and notice it says then and she got on her knees and she never noticed the Dignity of the temple woo she never noticed the dignified priest as he walked out she was in such distress till her tears was rolling down her cheeks and she was crying in desperation oh Lord God give me a son give me a son and notice she wasn't selfish when God heard her and answered her prayer and gave her a son what did she do she gave him back to God and because that she was willing not to be selfish after God had answered her prayer he wasn't just any son he gave her a prophet and I want you to know there are still five full prophets who are born into the world today and there will be until we've all come to the unity of the faith there are Apostles Born Into the world today and there will be until we're all I cannot accept a three-fingered God that would make God a freak or a four-fingered god he has five fingers Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists and he's they're being born into the Earth sir they've been born and they're being born into the Earth and so you don't ever know mother that that little baby that you carry right now may have a role to play if if Jesus terries and he will if he's given them a role to play when she heard God and he answered her she gave him back to God she was willing not to be selfish he gave her a prophet oh what an extra blessing oh he's just full of them those little extra things that he gives not only a son but a prophet and there had been no open vision for many many years in Israel Samuel the first prophet for many years be because a mother got desperate that she could have no children she was past the age of Baron probably 60 70 years old and she prayed with desperation she must have this child what was it God had spoke to her no doubt you can't be desperate till God speaks to you oh Church rise and Shake Yourself pitch your conscience wake yourself up in this hour we must be desperate or perish some around us are climbing mountains don't you be on a slippery slide with the one sitting next to you on the Pew climbing mountains you make up your mind I'm climbing mountains too if he can I can if she can I can I'm not going backwards I'm going upwards he said there's coming uh there is coming forth something from the Lord I know it is the say of the Lord there's coming forth something and we better get desperate it's between life and death it'll pass through us and we won't see it that's what brother brandom said about the brown bear Vision it passed through him and he missed it now that makes him an expert in telling us how important it is not to let something pass through US sir because that she wasn't selfish paragraph 101 she was given a prophet brother brandom says in the message expectation paragraph 44 here not long ago listen carefully I was coming from Dallas Texas in Spring and I I thought I was flying back and I was grounded at Memphis right where had to be one night on the 5th at Memphis Tennessee I was grounded there and they put me up there in that I believe the Peabody Hotel it's called how many has anybody in here ever been to the Peabody Hotel it's the hotel where all the Ducks March out every day they March the Ducks from the roof where they're kept to the pond if you go in in in any Peabody Hotel there are ducks swimming in the in the fountain and at the end of the day people gather you'd think it was like The Changing of the Guard people gather out of their rooms to come down to the Fountain to watch a a a a duck keeper to come out and March those Ducks out of the fountain and back up they all March up one one right after another and he marches them back up to where they spend the night brother brandom I just trying to imagine brother brandham in a peab hotel I wonder if he watched the Ducks I wonder if they did it back then he said it's a very nice place myself I couldn't afford to go in it but the airlines sent me there and I remember that morning they called me and said now the plane will leave at 8:00 Reverend brandom said they'll be by to pick you up are you listening are you sure you're listening now in the same message uh uh uh no in the same title expectation now he's in Bingington New York paragraph 63 he says I was crossing coming from Dallas Texas from a convention each time he told it you got a little more detail he said just recently about three years ago I was crossing over and a storm struck us in a plane and we were grounded and they put us in a big hotel there I couldn't afford to stay in a hotel like that but the air service put Peabody Hotel in Memphis Tennessee and that night we was up there now they called up the next morning said the plane will be ready to leave at 7:00 so he's got the time different here what does that matter does that offend anybody you think he wasn't a prophet because one time he said 8:00 and another time he said 7:00 you think that changed the ministry that God gave him hello not at all it reminds me that he was a human being and he didn't have the gift of perfect recall he said I'd wrote some letters I'd anointed some handkerchiefs and so forth and was going to go put it in the mail so I got up got the mail and started down the street I was going down to put it in the mailbox I was going out down there walking along please listen and the Holy Spirit said stop well I thought I just and let let me tell you something it's not only prophets that the Holy Ghost talks to he'll tell you to stop if you'll listen he'll tell you where to turn don't you ever think that it's only an elitist group of people that God will direct that way he'll direct you that way if he can trust you if he can trust you he'll direct you this way he said I just imagine I heard that he said just going to try to Shake it Off went a little further farther he says and something began to go I stopped and I said I need a little water somebody if you'll help me Father what is it that you would have me do I stepped back up to a place like this I was just a little piece from the post office stay with me now let's go to the next the next one is also from the message expectations no it's led by the spirit Minneapolis what I did was I tried to put a few of them together to get the story he said recently on my road to Dallas I'll hurry quickly on my road going to Dallas the plane was grounded and I thought oh my I stayed all night the next morning going down to put my mail in the Box they told us they' come pick us up I was going down the street trying to sing that little old Christian song The Pentecost folks sing I'm one of them glad that I can say thank you glad that I can say I'm one of them brother brandham ask this staunchy crowd did you did you ever hear it it's a people almost everywhere he gets a words a little wrong here it's a people almost everywhere Hearts all burning with flames as the fire that fell on the holy ghost that makes us all the same he knew he didn't get it right or something like that and I was TR why do you emphasize that because I absolutely love it and I was trying to sing it going down the street my letters in my hand going walking along down the street see had no email couldn't send an email he said I started across the street the holy spirit said stop you're right in front of a Bank Memphis Tennessee I thought oh my what's this computer's a little hung up I walked over in a corner and I said father what would you have me do I Stood Still for a few minutes cuz I wasn't thinking about it I felt that real strange feeling move on me and said turn and go right back I went right back down past the hotel again just kept on going down the street humming to myself oh I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them going on I went way on down to the other side of Memphis and if anybody knows anything about the other side of Memphis you know what he's talking about on down to the color District I thought what am I doing down here just led by the spirit and I looked and said cross this way and I crossed over the street and went down the other side what are you reading about I'm I'm reading about the power of a real Mother's Prayer so far it's brought a storm in that's grounded a plane put a prophet in a Peabody Hotel overnight told the plane was going to leave at 7 or 8:00 that evening he's trying to mail his mail in a mailbox and the spirit of God has directed him now to go back he's passed the hotel he stayed in found himself now by the leadership of the Holy Spirit on the other side of town on the other side of Memphis just hearing cross this way stop here turn there turned to my right went up the street this way all the little white washed places there little colored places where the colored lived and remember this was a time when it was respectful to say colored and I passed by and I seen a temple wouldn't they all be crazy about this kind of a statement now this generation so woke that they've took I grew up with a Jama she sat on my breakfast table my whole life I loved her she was like a mammy to me and now this Society you read about that woman and you you you'll be amazed at what a genius she was and they've tried to Wi for right out of History well here was a real old Aunt jamama with a shirt a man's shirt tied around her head leaning over the gate ah thank you Lord the sun was coming up roses around the gate the sun kissing away the fragrance from the rose oh this is a prophetic moment when you start noticing the birds and the flowers and the fragrance you can almost always know you're in something then cuz we look over those things every day of our life there he starts noticing it it's like the morning after you're saved the oldtimers used to say the Birds Sang prettier than they've ever sung before and the grass was greener and everything your your perspective changes Sun kissing away the fragrance and the air was full the birds are singing how glorious and I laid my hand going along like that singing lead of the spirit I looked at her as I passed by she was leaning over the gate she said good morning Parson and he's explaining it to these Yankees in Minneapolis he said down in the South I'm not through down in the South it's Parson you know instead of when I lived in South Carolina the most respectful title they give you was preacher people around here can say preacher and it's sounds like monster he's a preacher but in South Carolina when they said preacher it meant something well it used to be Parson I said good morning Auntie and she wiped the tears from her eyes and began to laughing I said how do you know I was a Parson do you know me she said no sir I said how do you know I was a Parson said Parson did you ever hear about a woman in the Bible the shunamite woman and I said yes said the lord gave her a child I said yes said it's a woman that was Barren eyes was a woman that was Barren too and the lord gave me a son and said I promised to raise him for the Lord said I've done my best but said Parson he took the road that's wrong said he's a fine young man and he's backslid and said he went out with the wrong company and said he's laying in there now said the doctors had done gone give him all the shots they can he's been unconscious now for two days the doctor says that he's going to die it's a venial disease said don't give him everything said done give him everything that could be given but it was too late before they caught it and he he going to die and said Parson I know him laying there dying a backslider said I couldn't stand it can you hear a mother's heart she said I prayed and I prayed and I said Lord you gave me that boy but where is Elijah at glory to so I prayed and I prayed and said this morning a little for day the Lord told me you see he don't just talk to prophets he pray he talks to praying mammies too he talks to praying mothers too so I prayed and I prayed the Lord told me come out here and stand at this gate and her back was wet with DW said I just stood there cause said I believe in the leading of the spirit oh my there's where God and believer meets together on Common Grounds of Faith she said he told me to stand here and said the sun came up she'd been there before the sun came up her back wet with Dew said I just kept waiting when you come down the street said I know I know you was The Parson I said my name is brandom she told me what her name was I said did you ever hear of my services no sir Parson she wasn't a follower of the of The Healing Ministry of brother brandham claim to have never heard his name you didn't have to know brother bram's name she knew the name of somebody higher she called on him and God sent random no sir Parson I told her about it and the tears began to run down her cheeks I know she must have thought I got the right one now said I know the Lord wouldn't fail me we went into the room there laid a fine big boy laying there about 160 or 70 lbs picture of Health blankets gathered in his hands like this going she walked over and patted him on the cheek she said Mam's baby might be old as he was but you know there's a mother's love you're always mama's baby you folk hear that you know that Mother's Love No matter what you do it's never forgotten mother's love so she patted him on the cheek and said mama's baby and I took a hold of his feet and his feet was cold I thought oh my he's dying I said Andy he's in awful bad shape said yes sir Parson the doctor said he'd never gain Consciousness no more I held his feet and I said shall we pray she said yes Parson I just want to remind you she didn't have a prayer card she'd never been to a service where he was but her faith said here I am like a shite woman with the son that you give me and you sent an Elijah and I need an Elijah and so God sent one who come under that anointing of the spirit of Elijah there's a bridal company of people who are going to find the same anointing in this hour you better believe what I'm telling you wasn't just for the prophet you need the spirit in power of Elijah on your life you need to be moved from stale Christianity to a supernatural walk with God and I do too she knelt down on the floor she began praying I tell you that Old Saint prayed a prayer that youd know she was talking to God Jesus and when she got through praying she said thank you dear Lord I walked over to where he was at and looked at him a little bit and I laid my hands over on him and I said dear God I don't know why you led me down here my plan's ready to leave now but I said I don't know why you led me here but I just come by the leading and now in the name of your son Jesus I lay hands upon this dying boy for him for his life for his soul to be saved and he cried out Mammy oh Mammy she said he's talking Parson hadn't talked for two days said Mammy it's getting light said it's getting light in here mmy I can see where my boats are going now a few minutes he was on the floor listen rejoicing happy about a week later I got a letter from him that that the doctors pronounced him negative God healed him of of a a venial disease a sexual disease of which there was no cure for her God not only healed him but proved to the doctors he was healed he's living tonight in Memphis Tennessee healthy and strong because this dear old mother follow the leading of the Holy Spirit those that are Sons and Daughters of God are led by the spirit of God isn't that right is that the end of that one let's go to the next and that Old Saint got down this goes back just a little but I want you to hear it and that Old Saint got down there and prayed oh my just writing rying the heart ring just ring the heart and I I know it means like ringing the wash and I got up and I felt his feet there cold and sticky death was on him and then we nailed again and began to pray and I said dear Lord I don't know why you sent me down here but you turned me on the road like that and brought me here and I know it's pass time for the plane however however the plane I'm still reading honey however the plane was delayed two hours so I said I don't know why you brought me here but now in obedience to the leading of the SP spirit I lay my hands upon this boy in the name of your son Jesus Christ he said Mammy it's getting light in a few moments up on his feet I passed by there through through a few months ago he met me at Abbey station he said brother brandom I'm perfectly normal now and it's all gone from me now in the in the message expectation he goes on a few months after that I was passing through on the train and I stopped in to get something to eat and I heard somebody holler Parson Brown phom he was putting one of these little carts around like that down there at the station working he run grabbed a hold of my hand you remember me and I said no I don't he said I was the boy you come to that morning that the Lord LED you down there when my when mamy was praying said Parson brandom it's perfectly whole now and I'm a Christian now Christian oh brother and you know what the plane never left something happened to it about an hour late and and I got on the plane he's going back I got on the plane and got home in time anyhow what did God do he grounded the plane he said let me tell you something Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever his power omnipotent he can't fail musicians are coming he's the same God that was in Memphis Tennessee that night Fort Wayne Indiana here tonight do you believe that he's the same he can't fail hall and then in the message of fire he said and some months from then two or three months later I was coming through on a train making my way to Phoenix and I stopped you know how the trains pull I went up there in the little restaurant to get something to eat I heard somebody hollering Parson brandom I looked and here he was a Red Cap down there you remember me no sir I was a boy I read this because of the last thing he said I was the boy that was dying down there that morning when the Lord sent you down would answer my M's prayer he said he never only healed me but he saved me he said I full of the Holy Ghost now Parson hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord do you see what happens when a real mother's faith is put into action he changed everything first of all he had to send a storm that would keep brother bandham there overnight and then he supernaturally led him turn here stop here go this way cross the street here yeah he spoke to Mammy when she called out to God I need an Elijah he said you go out there and lean on the gate don't you love how God was working on both ends of the line so what's mmy do before the Sun's Up she's out there leaning on the gate her back wet with do and here he come good morning Parson how do you know I would woo I don't have to tell it again I just read it but it brings me so much joy God loved that woman so much he honored the faith of that Praying Mother so much that he put all of those circumstances in place to give her her son back not only healed and whole but saved and filled with the Holy Ghost if God can do that for mamy's boy dying with a veneral disease don't you know God can move move for your children sister Beverly don't you know God can move for your children don't you know he knows how and listen folks he doesn't have to have an Elijah to do it if there's nobody he can send or wants to send he knows how to send something into the room and there because so many watching this because you raised your children right they know that there's a supernatural God it wouldn't take much to get a hold of their heart when we look at it we think it's hopeless but I'm telling you a real mother's faith can move a lot of things including this weather let's stand I'm so thankful for many many years I did all the praying my mama didn't pray for me she didn't serve the Lord I prayed for her I held on to God for her I'd ask her mama wouldn't you going to quit smoking and surrender your heart and serve the Lord she'd say I love to smoke I said mother is killing you she'd said well you got to die with something she had no desire there was nothing she was always dressed so nice she worked at the bank she was always dressed so nice she didn't even know how bad she smelled the smoke just permeated the room and then perfume on top of that would nearly knock you down and I kept praying she would come to a service and and I would preach my heart out and she would go no no pull it looked like it looked like there was no conviction she kept it from me that God was even dealing with her heart and then that day he didn't send an Elijah he just came he sent his presence into the automobile she's driving across the Dillingham Street Bridge right right down there close to chili Tha in Columbus and the spirit of the Lord came into the car save my mama she said Lord if you'll save me I'll Never Smoke again and she did terrible thing she threw that cigarette over the bridge and into the river but it was a wonderful thing I don't know how as addicted as she was I don't know how she found the grace to let it go and not only that the drinking started a social drink and it got to where it was ever night had to be ever night she had so much uh she was carrying in her life and when the Lord saved her she had found a man that cared about her and he was good to her and uh unusual circumstances and when God saved her she said I don't know how I'm going to find the grace but she said I know I can can't marry that man I could never be with him I I can't I know I know what my life has to be I have to serve the Lord she didn't do it perfectly but she did it with all of her heart and from that moment on then she prayed for me and when I was at my weakest Point lowest point my mama prayed for me and fasted for me like many of you did until her hair would fall out by the handfuls she returned ear the favor and God heard her prayer and I'm telling you what that that reminds me and helps me to know that you sisters have more power you'll never maybe never sit at a at a committee table and move businesses around you you may never be a CEO of anything but your address but you've got power in your faith that can move a mighty God I want to honor every one of you I know I know too much I know the sacrifices I know the women in this house The Mamas who prayed for wavered husbands and God heard their prayer not even their mama their wife and God heard their prayer I know mothers in this room that have prayed for their children and God has heard their prayer again and again and again so I want to tell you something mothers I know you know this I don't have to tell you but you're not going to be perfect you're going to make mistakes and we already have and we will again we do the best we can with what we have but I want you to know there's a God bigger than your mistakes bigger than any slackness on your part bigger than any little thing you wished you'd have done right my wife was reading an article this week and she told me she said I wish i' I wish this would have dawned on me I wish I would have had a hold of this earlier I I wish I I would have realized the importance of some of this earlier well we can't go back and change that but we know a God who can we know a God who can instill those things in them that they need for the future to those who are not mothers you don't have to be a mama to pray I owe more than I could ever tell you to spiritual women to women who prayed for me like a mother and God sees that and he fills their life with that responsibility I'm so thankful for you so very thankful I know that it's not only me you've prayed for you've prayed for all of us many of you that are here have prayed for all of us Sister train who is not here prayed for so many of us stayed here longer than she should have because she was praying when she didn't know where she was she was still praying God left her here to intercede that's the prayer of of a and the faith of a Godly woman we are so blessed those of you who are about to be mothers you see this responsibility that lies before you it'll overwhelm you at times but you've got to lean on the Lord you have to lean on him you will get it wrong you will there'll be a time you do but his grace and his Mercy if you'll let him if you'll depend on him if you'll fall on him he'll give you all the mercy you need to get up and do it again cuz like I said you you can't throw it out in the trash like a dead plant they're with you they're they're you're you're responsible I wish everybody who laid down together knew how important it is to know that you've got what it takes to see it through to the end because you don't get to drop out of this thing it's a lifelong commitment well if I could just get him out of my house I want you to know if you think the burden lifts if you think that lifts a burden you'll carry a burden for them the longest day of your life woo and when you get out of here if you get out of here before they do you'll still be praying for them on the other side I believe with all my heart I don't believe in the intercession of the Saints in the sense that we pray to them and get them to go to the father for us but I believe I believe I got mama and two Granny's on the other side who are still praying for me to make it all way I'm going all the way I want every mother in this place and I would invite you if you've been a spiritual mother I would invite you to come as well I don't mean to differentiate between the two I don't know what we would have done without some of you praying for our own kids sister elreda has done that Sister Williams of course she had children of her own but has prayed for me and and I I I would love to she she's not here today but I'd love to say thank you to Judith she's prayed for our kids and still does and God has spoke to her in so many times and she has sent a word and it was nothing but God and nothing but the truth and it brought their mother and I so much comfort to know that God was talking to somebody else if you've ever experienced that to know that God's talking to somebody else about your kids I'll tell you you'll appreciate it you'll be so thankful for it you be that one you be one who will do such a thing as that every mother come I want you to come I I really really wanted to to be done quicker oh I wished I wish that I could do what Oprah did I wish that I could give every one of these mothers the desire of their heart a brand new car or a brand new house or brand new husband no I'm kidding I do I wished I could I I believe every one of you'd be worthy of it and I can't honor you enough you all come this way come on in some of you that can't let's let's move move in a little closer cuz I'm going to call the rest you are looking at the cream of the crop and some are missing today I I miss I miss hope I wish you could be here today and sister man and and and other mother sister Anna so many others but you're looking at some of the godliest women I have confidence in every one of them why don't we just come and stand behind them if you're if you're a family member a daughter son and you can get through the crowd I just like I just like for those of you who can I know some of us are working now and and can't but if you could I'd like for you to get close to and if your companion can't get to you because of a Duty please forgive us Jenna's about to be a mother I mean I say they are mothers already in Jennifer they're they've already learned a lot can't always eat what you want to eat you can't take a hill for every sniffle you have to be careful when you're carrying a life so they've already learned some responsibility it's about to get good can you imagine being a mother of twins double blessing wow can you all just play something soft just a moment and we're going to just pray I don't want to be the only one praying I want you to pray I want your families to pray for you lay your hand on Mother dear or someone near you if you see someone without a family lay your hand on them oh God the nights when these mamas have walked the floors thank you put a coal rag on fever brow and cleaned up the vomit oh God I don't have enough to reward them but I know one of these days eternity is going to smile on them and you're going to honor them for every sacrifice that they have made for every meal cook for every Bible story told for every time they have fulfilled their responsibility when their own flesh was weary and Warn and they seem to have no help God I ask today that you would flow down in this place and to everyone watching this service whether by live stream or whether by archive and I pray Lord that you would strengthen and sustain every mother Lord I I pray Lord that you would wipe away any shame that they have had to carry for any mistakes that theyve made along the way I wish that you would just come Lord and wipe all that away and I pray that you will you just love them and embrace them in such a way by your spirit that they would know how valuable they are to you and how valuable they are to us to their families Lord strengthen their faith may they not get to look at at the waves may they not get to listening to the howling of the wind but may they look beyond the wind and waves and may they see the rock may they see you as the promise May their faith be ever strengthened Lord to hold on to you no matter what it looks like until that day that you bring their lost loved ones in father I pray that you would bring the spirit of conviction upon the the young people and the children that are not always children anymore the young adults and adults that are represented today by father mother here I pray Lord that you'd bring the spirit of conviction into their life that they would wake up to the reality that Mama's faith is real and that her cry is faithful and may they find the god of mom and dad that old song I have returned to the god of my childhood Lord grant it I pray for the back slider yes Lord For the Fallen for those who are drinking the wine of their own bad choices redeem them Lord redeem the time and bring them to you bless our wives bless our mothers today strengthen them in every way encourage them in every way I saw sister Anna's post this morning and she was speaking to Bethany who had not yet had a family of her own that day is coming but she was commending her for being such an auntie and Lord that's that's true for so many in this room bless these sisters who have labored in the spirit on behalf of children that they did not bear with their own body it's understandable when a biological mother has a burden for her kids but it's only Supernatural when someone who didn't birth them can carry such a heavy load for them to God be the glory let them be rewarded for everything that is accomplished in your name in the name of Jesus may they feel treasured and loved today been let's come and worship just a

be Remembered in prayer and we want to do that I have prayed last night but we want to do that as we leave and sister Sharon had sent a text and she would very much like to have been here today her mother is is low and weak is not eating a whole lot and is sleeping most of the time and so sister Sharon needs our prayers we need to pray that God will strengthen her she's been very faithful to pray for us and we want to believe the Lord to strengthen her it's it's a hard time and the the thought of you're spending your last Mother's Day some of us have been there you're spending your last Mother's Day perhaps with your mother it's a little overwhelming it can can certainly be and even harder for those who don't know it and it and yet it happens but we want to lift them up to the Lord in prayer that God will be with them and and we want to pray for safety for those who are traveling in any time that brother Daniel and sister Anna come to your mind please pray for them can you imagine being on the dangerous highways with a big old truck and trailer and pulling sometimes two and three travel trailers on a trailer I I don't I don't know how uh they can do it but it's only by the grace of God and there's not been just a couple of close calls there have been many close calls so if if they should come to your mind I hope they will pray for them that God will continue to grant them safety and the Lord willing they plan to be with us here over the Memorial Day we weekend we're looking for God to do some great things let's pray let's have a little dismissal prayer thank you for your patience today I hope that your fellowship is amazing this afternoon and for those of you who didn't get to be with your mother today I think of you and I'm going to pray the Lord will

deliverer you are still more than able to do exceedingly and abundantly above we pray oh God that every need would be met and supplied from your Bountiful Supply go with us today bless our time with our mothers and cheer those who couldn't be with Mom today and every mother who perhaps couldn't be with her children cheer her heart Lord and and remind her that she is fulfilled feeling of very important responsibility in using her faith and prayers for her family we ask for you to continue to help us press through in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and for his glory and the saint
