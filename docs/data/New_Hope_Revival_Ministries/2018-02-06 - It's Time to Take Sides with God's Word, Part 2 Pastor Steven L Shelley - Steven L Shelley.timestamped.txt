[0:12] Ascended life the supernatural life from
[0:15] the realm of the Spirit
[0:20] [Music]
[0:24] but I've got good news for you and that
[0:27] is God by nature is a redeemer
[0:30] [Music]
[0:36] is surrendering our mind to the word
[0:39] that's what makes the big difference
[0:41] that's the great mystery right Weist
[0:43] in you the hope a lord
[0:45] [Music]
[1:00] I'm pastor Stephen Shelley from New Hope
[1:03] revival ministries in Smith Station
[1:05] Alabama and I'm coming to you again on
[1:08] behalf of brother Eric Erickson and the
[1:11] gospel channel again we are so delighted
[1:14] to be in partnership with the gospel
[1:16] channel to bring you some programming
[1:19] hopefully it will be a blessing to you
[1:21] I want to thank you so much for calling
[1:25] the prayer line for your emails your
[1:28] contact with us is so greatly
[1:31] appreciated you know it's a delight when
[1:33] I'm able to go to the pulpit and share
[1:36] with the congregation that someone is on
[1:38] the other end of the television camera
[1:41] that you're watching and that you're
[1:43] being encouraged we even have had some
[1:47] of you precious folk have left a
[1:49] messages on the answering service
[1:51] because we have no idea when the
[1:53] programs are airing and repeat and so
[1:56] sometimes you're leaving a message on
[1:59] the prayer line and and what a delight
[2:01] it is to hear that message and hear the
[2:04] program playing in the background that
[2:06] just reminds us that what we do is not
[2:10] in vain and we've only been doing it for
[2:13] a few short years and to this magnitude
[2:16] only a very short time but the folks
[2:18] that the gospel channel have been doing
[2:20] this for many many years and their
[2:23] dedication to bring you good programming
[2:27] touches me deeply and I know that it is
[2:30] their desire to encourage the
[2:32] discouraged while also reaching out to
[2:35] those who have not trusted the Lord
[2:37] Jesus as their personal Savior so would
[2:40] you stand with the gospel channel with
[2:42] your prayers and with your giving we
[2:45] invite you to sow a generous seed into
[2:49] the work of the gospel Channel thank you
[2:52] for reaching out to us from Spain and
[2:56] from Ireland and we really would like to
[2:59] know just how far we're reaching out
[3:02] with the broadcast here on the gospel
[3:05] channel so you can also use the number
[3:08] on your screen to let us
[3:10] know where you're listening where you're
[3:12] watching from or you can write us an
[3:15] email and it would just be a blessing to
[3:18] be able to to go again to the
[3:20] congregation and say they're hearing us
[3:23] in Ireland they're hearing us in
[3:25] Scotland it's just a joy when we were
[3:28] together recently we were talking about
[3:31] one of the themes that the Lord had
[3:33] given us as the old year was leaving us
[3:37] and a new year was approaching and one
[3:40] of the things that the Lord said to us
[3:43] was that we should really take sides
[3:46] with the Word of God and you know the
[3:50] Word of God is more than a than the
[3:53] Bible the the Bible is of course the
[3:57] written record of God's Word but we also
[4:00] know that Jesus Christ our Messiah and
[4:03] Savior is the Living Word we know from
[4:08] John 1 that in the beginning was the
[4:11] word and the Word was with God and the
[4:13] Word was God and the word became flesh
[4:18] the Word of God took on a fleshly form a
[4:24] body in our Lord Jesus Christ so who was
[4:29] Jesus he was God he was the Word of God
[4:34] made flesh in a fleshly body so when
[4:38] when the Lord began to speak to us about
[4:41] taking sides with the word it it's not
[4:44] just standing up for the Bible but it's
[4:46] taking sides with Jesus Christ I want
[4:49] you to know that around the world it's
[4:51] becoming very unpopular to to name the
[4:56] name of Jesus to be identified with
[4:59] Yeshua his Hebrew name to say I'm a
[5:03] Christian it it really is becoming
[5:06] unpopular again in the world and I think
[5:11] that it would be very very easy for us
[5:14] to blend into society to blend in to
[5:18] culture I recently heard in a political
[5:22] speech and saw
[5:24] young man who had made a tremendous
[5:28] journey to defect from his country where
[5:32] he had been a deeply persecuted and
[5:36] tortured had even lost a limb and he was
[5:42] given an opportunity as a student in
[5:45] that country somehow to visit another
[5:49] country another Asian country and when
[5:53] he returned to his country one of the
[5:56] things they wanted to know was did you
[5:59] meet any Christians were you in contact
[6:02] with any Christians and of course he was
[6:06] again persecuted and tortured because he
[6:11] couldn't deny that indeed he had met
[6:14] Christians on the journey so this
[6:16] reminds us that we're living in a very
[6:19] tolerant society but perhaps not as
[6:22] tolerant of old-fashioned Bible
[6:26] believers but I want you to know that I
[6:29] know that we're speaking right now to
[6:33] some old-fashioned Bible believers we're
[6:37] not just hearing from from young people
[6:40] we're hearing from the elderly and I
[6:44] want you to know that it really warms my
[6:47] heart when someone calls or contacts us
[6:51] and they say I'm nearly 80 or I'm in my
[6:55] 80s I'm 85 one dear sister called it
[7:00] really blesses us because I know that
[7:04] you are still here for a reason your
[7:07] life I pray that it has been well lived
[7:10] and that God is preserving you and and
[7:13] helping you in your health but you're
[7:16] alive for a reason for a purpose until
[7:19] the day that the Lord should call you
[7:21] home or he should come and rapture his
[7:24] bride out of this world
[7:26] you have a purpose you're not finished
[7:28] with your destiny and so for us to know
[7:32] that we can encourage you
[7:34] we can be a blessing to you we had
[7:36] intercessors to say I'm an intercessor
[7:39] in my church but I'm under attack and I
[7:41] need prayer what a joy for us to be able
[7:44] to stand with you in in your journey
[7:47] because we understand that the
[7:50] temptation is there to blend into
[7:53] society and and just go with the flow
[7:56] but God bless you strengthen you
[8:00] encourage you for taking a stand in this
[8:03] new year for the word of God and we mean
[8:08] as much as possible in a
[8:11] non-confrontational manner we're not
[8:14] talking about being judgmental we're not
[8:17] talking about being in people's faces in
[8:19] fact much to the contrary what we're
[8:22] talking about is living the word life
[8:26] the life that the Word of God produces
[8:30] the person of the word the character of
[8:34] the word the love of the Word of God I'm
[8:37] telling you the most beautiful love
[8:39] story that has ever been written in the
[8:42] in the history of all the world is this
[8:46] written record of God's Word it is
[8:50] history
[8:51] it is his story and it is a love story
[8:54] Oh what manner of love the father hath
[8:58] bestowed upon us that we could and
[9:02] should be called the sons of God I don't
[9:05] know about you but I'm feeling my
[9:07] father's love right now there are times
[9:10] in the busyness of life that we don't
[9:13] feel that love and that protection and
[9:16] that concern but I'm telling you he is
[9:18] always there his love for us is
[9:23] unconditional it is unchanging and it is
[9:27] eternal so the least that we can do is
[9:31] to love him in response when we are
[9:34] shadowed overshadowed showered with his
[9:38] love it produces something so wonderful
[9:42] in our life a hunger a desire to be more
[9:46] like him
[9:48] and so we we owe him this duty of loving
[9:53] him and serving him and taking sides
[9:56] with him and pointing other pilgrims to
[10:00] the cross this is a journey and a
[10:03] journey is not accomplished in one day
[10:06] one year even there there are journeys
[10:09] like this journey the spiritual journey
[10:12] that is over the course of your lifetime
[10:16] I recognize that some people's deaths
[10:19] seaman timely while others live to be
[10:23] what we call a ripe old age but
[10:26] regardless of the span of time in any
[10:30] individual's life it is a journey we are
[10:34] journeying back to the heart of our
[10:36] Father we are heading back to his heart
[10:40] his mind in his great love for us and
[10:44] there are hills and valleys there are
[10:47] smooth places in Jesus and there are
[10:51] bumpy places in the kingdom of God but I
[10:55] want you to keep on keeping on taking
[10:58] sides for the word of God when we were
[11:02] with you last time sharing that theme we
[11:05] ended up in a verse of scripture that
[11:08] I'd like to begin with on this program
[11:11] in mark chapter 4 and verse 24 in the
[11:15] amplified version of the Bible it reads
[11:18] if any man has ears to hear let him be
[11:23] listening and let him perceive and
[11:27] comprehend this is the words of Jesus he
[11:31] wants you to perceive his word he wants
[11:36] you to be able to understand his word in
[11:41] fact he provides the spirit of
[11:44] understanding he washes our eyes or
[11:48] anoint our eyes with eyesalve by
[11:52] revelation that we can see God's Word in
[11:56] a very very personal way
[11:59] God is a personable God he's a God of
[12:03] relationship and this love story
[12:05] recorded in the Bible is a personal love
[12:09] story it starts off by God loving a
[12:13] nation his great love for a people a
[12:17] nation a tribe of people or a number of
[12:21] tribes of people making up a nation his
[12:24] great heart and love for the Hebrew
[12:28] people we call them now the Israeli
[12:31] people or the Jewish people but the New
[12:33] Testament reveals to us in in a much
[12:37] broader scope that his love is not just
[12:41] for a people it's also for individuals
[12:45] those who will join themselves to the
[12:49] Covenant that God has made with mankind
[12:52] that makes it very personal that makes
[12:55] it about me that makes it about you when
[13:00] you read the Bible your attitude is
[13:02] important the way you approach it the
[13:05] way you perceive it is important you
[13:08] must not view it as just a history book
[13:11] of what God has done or what God has
[13:15] been but you must see it as it was
[13:18] intended it is a book first of types and
[13:23] symbols and shadows and then in the
[13:26] newer covenant or the New Testament we
[13:28] see everything that was concealed in the
[13:32] Old Testament in symbol form and
[13:34] typology we see it revealed we see the
[13:39] key to the map to begin to understand
[13:42] what some of the offerings were speaking
[13:45] about all of the services of the temple
[13:49] the furniture of the tabernacle all of
[13:52] these things pointing not to a religion
[13:56] but to a person the Lord Jesus Christ
[13:59] I remember Jesus speaking one day in the
[14:03] Gospels and he said your father Abraham
[14:06] rejoiced to see me in his day I want you
[14:10] to know that that God was
[14:13] feeling his plan of redemption even to
[14:16] father Abraham
[14:17] he looked afar off the Bible says in in
[14:21] the English translation but in the
[14:23] Hebrew it speaks of a much deeper
[14:27] experience that Abraham was having he
[14:30] wasn't just looking far off in the
[14:32] physical distance but he was looking far
[14:36] off in the spiritual and he was seeing
[14:39] on that very mountain
[14:41] another day another lamb another
[14:45] sacrifice when I hear that even now it
[14:49] warms my heart because it was God
[14:52] wanting to encourage Abraham keep on
[14:56] keeping on no sacrifice is too great I
[15:00] receive your obedience and your
[15:03] willingness to obey as an offering as a
[15:07] sacrifice of your praise and your love
[15:10] for me and because of that I believe God
[15:13] wanted to give Abraham a token of
[15:17] understanding what it was all about in
[15:20] days to come in ages to come and so the
[15:24] New Testament reveals the coming of the
[15:28] Word of God in a body of flesh his
[15:31] earthly ministry just a short few years
[15:34] and his ultimate sacrifice for my sins
[15:40] I want to make it personal my sins to be
[15:43] forgiven we sing a song I owe the debt I
[15:47] could not pay he he paid a debt he did
[15:50] not owe I'm so thankful so thankful that
[15:54] my sin debt was paid ultimately once and
[15:58] for all first in the mind of God before
[16:02] the foundation of the world when the
[16:05] lamb was slain and then this thought of
[16:09] God this plan of God this whole I don't
[16:13] want to say scheme because when we hear
[16:15] that word we often think in the negative
[16:17] but the whole purpose of God was it was
[16:22] made real when it was made flesh when
[16:25] Jesus
[16:26] came in that earthly body of flesh he
[16:30] brought the purpose of God to the
[16:33] physical realm you could reach out and
[16:36] touch the word for the first time the
[16:40] word wasn't just an abstract a concept
[16:43] or a symbol a pillar of fire which was
[16:47] in every way beautiful and powerful the
[16:50] cloud by day in every way powerful and
[16:53] beautiful all of the miracles of the Old
[16:57] Testament the older covenant beautiful
[17:00] wonderful demonstrations of the power
[17:03] and authority of the one true Living God
[17:06] but it was not until Yeshua came it was
[17:09] not until the Lord Jesus was born of a
[17:12] virgin in a body of flesh that the
[17:15] purpose of God could be physically
[17:18] touched that little woman with the issue
[17:20] of blood if I can but touch the hem of
[17:23] His garment she wasn't just reaching out
[17:26] to touch the hem of a garment from that
[17:31] time period she wasn't just reaching out
[17:34] to touch the fringe of a prayer shawl
[17:37] that would have been already worn in the
[17:40] Second Temple period but she was
[17:43] reaching out to touch the Word of God
[17:46] made flesh the plan and purposes of God
[17:50] for this earth
[17:51] now fleshed out in an earthly body I
[17:55] want you to know the story does not end
[17:58] there in fact we see throughout the
[18:02] entirety of the scripture a plan of God
[18:05] being revealed unfolded unveiled slowly
[18:10] I have to say slowly but surely tying
[18:15] together the loose ends and putting the
[18:19] pieces of the puzzle together
[18:21] so that we can understand especially
[18:25] coming to the book of the revelation the
[18:28] last book of the of the New Testament we
[18:31] hear again a lot of symbols we hear a
[18:34] lot of of representations of things
[18:39] that will happen and we now know that
[18:42] some of the things that we read about in
[18:44] the book of the revelation are finished
[18:48] they are absolutely fulfilled and yet
[18:52] there are also many elements of that
[18:55] revelation by the way that's the
[18:58] revelation of Jesus Christ
[19:00] our Bible may title it the revelation of
[19:04] st. John the Divine but I want you to
[19:06] know that from from the first verse to
[19:08] the last verse it is unveiling again
[19:12] revealing a person the Lord Jesus Christ
[19:16] that's what this truth is about it's not
[19:20] about a religion it's not about a
[19:22] specific church or or a specific holy
[19:26] man it's not about a pastor or a prophet
[19:30] or an apostle it's so much more than
[19:33] that it's about Almighty God and in one
[19:38] phase one dimension of his ministry he
[19:42] became flesh he became an earthly man
[19:45] but I want you to know that what was in
[19:48] him is bigger than the body of a man
[19:52] eternal sovereign omnipotent God because
[19:57] the story doesn't end in the newer
[19:59] covenant in the New Testament because we
[20:02] can say the story goes on here we are
[20:05] you and I living 2,000 plus years since
[20:09] the Lord came since the word was made
[20:12] flesh and God still has a plan for today
[20:16] you know what I believe the gospel
[20:18] channel is a part of that endtime plan
[20:21] and so I want you to again bless bless
[20:25] them with your words bless them with
[20:27] your prayers and bless them with your
[20:30] gifing because I truly believe I'm not
[20:34] just saying that because I want to I
[20:36] want to make them feel good this is it's
[20:39] much more important than just a
[20:41] compliment or some form of flattery
[20:44] I truly believe by conviction that
[20:46] Christian television is one of the ways
[20:50] that God is revealing
[20:53] his endtime purposes and plans as we
[20:56] said a moment ago the story goes on the
[20:58] journey continues and I specifically
[21:01] feel that deep connection to the gospel
[21:05] channel
[21:06] it may not be the flashiest of the
[21:08] networks it may not even be the most
[21:11] powerful in the sense of of wattage of
[21:15] getting out
[21:17] we may not as of now cover as many
[21:20] satellites as some do or as many regions
[21:25] as some do but it's not over yet I truly
[21:28] believe that God has expansion in his
[21:32] mind for the gospel channel because I
[21:35] believe there's certain elements of the
[21:37] word that are so very important for the
[21:40] hour that we're living in right now we
[21:43] need to understand this Old Testament we
[21:47] need to understand this New Testament
[21:49] but we also need to understand what God
[21:52] desires to do in this hour that we're
[21:56] living in right now and that is what he
[21:59] did in 1 son what he did in one body he
[22:03] desires to do in a mini membered body a
[22:07] mini membered Bride he's racing up a
[22:10] company of over comers who emerge from
[22:14] the church yes of course Jesus Christ
[22:18] Yeshua our Messiah is married to the
[22:22] church
[22:22] I truly believe as he married himself to
[22:26] the nation of Israel in the Bible he is
[22:29] also committed to the church but in that
[22:32] church I believe according to the New
[22:35] Testament there will be those who rise
[22:38] up in the spirit of the overcomer who
[22:42] have an anointing to rise above the
[22:45] spirit of their age the spirit of this
[22:49] age that we live in right now now there
[22:51] are many spirits there there are many
[22:54] themes out there in in 2018 of course
[23:00] but one of the predominant spirits that
[23:04] relates to the church
[23:06] is the spirit we often refer to this as
[23:09] being the Laodicean Church age the the
[23:13] age of the Church of Laodicea we believe
[23:17] that the spirit that was predominant in
[23:20] that church age in that excuse me in
[23:24] that church there were seven churches of
[23:27] Asia Minor mentioned in the book of
[23:29] Revelation and we believe that those
[23:32] characteristics those attributes if you
[23:35] will of those seven churches that were
[23:38] present at the time that John was
[23:41] writing the book of the revelation those
[23:44] characteristics are very carefully
[23:46] recorded as well as a promised reward
[23:50] and I believe the detail in that in that
[23:54] narrative helps us to understand that it
[23:58] was much more than just seven churches
[24:01] and what was going on in those seven
[24:04] churches among those people though the
[24:07] peers
[24:08] perhaps they fellowship with one another
[24:10] and knew one another because the
[24:13] distances were not so great between
[24:16] those churches but I believe that we
[24:19] have the details recorded so carefully
[24:22] for us because it was prophetic and I
[24:27] believe that you can take the nature and
[24:29] the characteristics of those seven
[24:32] churches of Asia Minor are carefully
[24:34] recorded for us and lay them over the
[24:38] entirety of 2,000 plus years of church
[24:42] history and I believe you can see those
[24:46] predominant characteristics very evident
[24:50] across those ages of church history so
[24:55] that would mean that we are coming
[24:59] through Laodicea or the last I'm
[25:02] encouraged by the fact that there are no
[25:05] more Church ages after this the next is
[25:09] the bridal age or the the new the new
[25:14] day the new dawning the new millennium
[25:17] the wonderful reign of the Lord Jesus
[25:20] Christ which by the way is longer than a
[25:22] thousand years that's the millennial
[25:24] reign but after that a new heaven and a
[25:26] new earth at peace with God forevermore
[25:29] what a great thought that is and doesn't
[25:34] matter how many years we've been
[25:35] thinking about that it's still our
[25:37] blessed hope it is still the reason why
[25:40] we may not be conscious of the Lord's
[25:43] coming and his home that he has prepared
[25:47] for us every moment of the day what we
[25:50] may forget it
[25:51] some of us may have may even feel like
[25:53] that's just an outdated doctrine oh I'm
[25:57] telling you it's way more than a
[25:59] doctrine it's about to be a reality
[26:02] because as sure as you and I are sitting
[26:06] where we are right now me and Alabama
[26:09] and I don't know where you're sitting
[26:11] one of these days the dead in Christ are
[26:14] going to rise first and we which are
[26:17] alive and remain will be caught up
[26:19] together to meet them in the air so
[26:21] shall we ever be with the Lord you mean
[26:24] to tell me you really believe that
[26:26] preacher man with every cell in my body
[26:30] with all that I am I believe I'll tell
[26:34] you something else I believe I'm going
[26:36] to be a part of it one way or the other
[26:37] I'm nearing my fiftieth birthday so I
[26:41] realized that if Jesus terry's I don't
[26:44] have another 50 years of ministry left
[26:47] on this earth but I also believe that
[26:49] since the coming of the Lord is so near
[26:52] and we are seeing even even scriptures
[26:58] that that we have not emphasized through
[27:03] the years we've read them
[27:06] we had margins of understanding
[27:09] concerning them but you would almost
[27:12] call them hidden or I'm not sure the
[27:18] right term to use but but you know there
[27:20] are predominant scriptures that we
[27:22] associate with the endtime there's a
[27:24] list that we can make but there are
[27:27] scriptures especially hidden
[27:29] in the prophecies of the prophets of the
[27:31] Old Testament that we have not seen the
[27:35] full fulfillment and the full reality of
[27:38] those scriptures and now we're beginning
[27:39] to see things fulfilled and things
[27:44] lining up to be fulfilled that let us
[27:47] know that very soon
[27:49] every prophetic promise in this book is
[27:53] going to be fulfilled it's all going to
[27:55] be a reality now we say well this has
[27:58] happened but this hasn't happened this
[28:00] this here has happened but but this here
[28:03] has it but very very soon we're going to
[28:06] be able to say that everything that God
[28:09] so carefully recorded and men gave their
[28:12] lives to preserve it's a reality that's
[28:18] where we are the predominant spirit to
[28:22] go back to Laodicea just a moment the
[28:24] predominant spirit of the church we're
[28:27] not talking about the world at large
[28:30] because that that's huge there's a
[28:34] wildness there's an insanity that that
[28:38] is just bubbling sometimes beneath the
[28:43] surface in the world and sometimes spews
[28:47] like a volcano just a spirit of madness
[28:51] a spirit of insanity of people just
[28:54] absolutely losing their senses and you
[28:58] know my wife says to me sometimes how
[29:01] please tell me how that one human being
[29:05] could do that to another human being
[29:08] it's hard for many of us to understand
[29:11] because we have felt his love when you
[29:16] experience the love of our Heavenly
[29:18] Father and the way that he brought that
[29:22] love to us through the son our Lord
[29:26] Jesus Christ you're changed I mean you
[29:30] meet a love that is more than you've
[29:34] ever known before it's bigger than words
[29:37] and once that happens to you even even
[29:40] in a small way
[29:42] maybe you're like me and you're still
[29:46] discovering the depth of his love
[29:50] you're still understanding I mean I feel
[29:53] like that it's a revelation that
[29:56] continues to unfold
[29:58] oh how he loves me and I feel the same
[30:02] way about the blood I know by the
[30:04] scripture and you do as well why the
[30:06] blood came why why it had to be the way
[30:10] it was the life was in the blood and we
[30:13] understand that it was the shedding of
[30:17] blood not man's blood but blood that was
[30:19] specifically created for the token for
[30:23] the price the the actuation
[30:26] and activation we could say of the plan
[30:30] of redemption we understand that but I
[30:34] also believe that there is a depth
[30:37] there's a revelation there's an
[30:38] understanding of the blood just like his
[30:41] love that continues to expand I'm
[30:44] telling you there's power in the blood
[30:47] of Jesus Christ thank you Lord that it
[30:50] has been applied to my life thank God
[30:53] that many of you have invited him to
[30:56] come in by his spirit with his blood and
[31:00] set you free from the curse of sin and
[31:04] of death
[31:05] but I wanna i want more understanding i
[31:07] want to receive more revelation from him
[31:10] so yes there's all kinds of predominant
[31:13] spirits in the world we we're hearing
[31:15] about terrorism and and we're hearing
[31:18] about such strangeness such such unusual
[31:23] things emerging all of a sudden when it
[31:27] comes to issues of gender things that
[31:30] many of us no matter how hard we try we
[31:33] don't seem to to be able to understand I
[31:36] believe God died for everybody
[31:38] I believe his love is toward everybody I
[31:41] believe that God so loved the world that
[31:43] He gave His only begotten Son that
[31:46] whosoever believe believeth on him might
[31:49] not perish
[31:50] but have eternal life I believe that is
[31:53] the Word of God but I believe there are
[31:54] some things happening today some spirits
[31:58] that are being unleashed on planet Earth
[32:00] that are so far from the mind and the
[32:04] purpose of God such a vending and such a
[32:07] perversion of God's original plan and I
[32:10] don't want to be offensive to anybody
[32:12] but I'm going to take sides with the
[32:15] word and I'm going to say that it's not
[32:18] going to be all right with God there is
[32:21] a day of giving account to God for how
[32:26] we have surrendered to his plan this is
[32:30] not a journey of performance you're not
[32:32] going to win unless you perform the
[32:36] right way or you keep all of the right
[32:39] regulations there are Bible Commandments
[32:44] there are instructions that we we must
[32:47] hear and we must obey but it's not a
[32:50] journey of performance it's going to be
[32:53] a journey of relationship of be being
[32:58] less and him being more in my life
[33:01] that's where we are so even though all
[33:04] this is going on in the world there that
[33:07] I think the predominant spirit of the
[33:09] church age that we're living in right
[33:12] now is is certainly Laodicea was a was
[33:18] an age of of people's rights everyone
[33:21] wanting wanting their rights it's also a
[33:24] period of of lukewarm Christianity a
[33:29] real watered-down non-committed form of
[33:36] what it means to be a bible-believing
[33:39] Christian and we might get by in the
[33:42] interim but but there's a reckoning
[33:44] coming and there is an awakening coming
[33:48] to a body of people I believe that with
[33:51] all my heart and that's one of the
[33:53] reasons why I'm coming to you today
[33:55] that's one of the reasons why we're
[33:58] partnering with the gospel channel it's
[34:00] because we believe that even in this
[34:03] dark hour of uncertainty we believe that
[34:08] God is going to have a people who will
[34:11] work the works of Jesus Christ where did
[34:14] you get such a crazy idea as that the
[34:17] Bible the words of Jesus we sometimes
[34:21] say the red letters
[34:23] I didn't plan to read this but in
[34:26] Revelation chapter 3 and I have
[34:29] amplified in front of me it says enter
[34:32] the angel messenger of the Assembly the
[34:34] Church in Laodicea these are the words
[34:38] of the Amen the trusty and faithful and
[34:41] true witness the origin and beginning
[34:44] and author of God's creation I know your
[34:47] record of works and what you are doing
[34:49] you are neither cold nor hot would that
[34:53] you were cold or hot God's desire for
[34:56] that church in Asia Minor was that they
[35:00] would be hot or cold cold or hot his
[35:04] desire for the church today in the
[35:07] church age of Laodicea is that we would
[35:11] be hot or cold but he said in verse 16
[35:15] so because you are lukewarm and neither
[35:17] cold nor hot I will spew you out of my
[35:21] mouth that doesn't seem to me like a God
[35:24] who will look over our continual
[35:30] disrespect for what he is asking of us
[35:33] be colder hunt you know this in-between
[35:39] straddling of the fence it's like the
[35:42] call of the of the captain in the Bible
[35:46] choose you this day whom you will serve
[35:49] if God be God and serve Him if by all be
[35:54] God than you you sir Bale but you have
[35:57] to make a choice and I believe that's
[36:00] what Jesus was saying through John to
[36:04] the church of present day that present
[36:08] day Laodicea but also to this church age
[36:13] perhaps beginning
[36:16] in the in somewhere around 1906 but but
[36:19] the beginnings of the Pentecostal age
[36:22] could be traced all the way back to 1895
[36:25] but all of the recorded church history
[36:28] that most of us can get at our
[36:31] fingertips from from Azusa Street where
[36:35] the gifts were restored the power of the
[36:38] Holy Ghost we call it the Pentecostal
[36:41] experience because it was given on the
[36:44] day of Pentecost or the feast of Shavuot
[36:47] this these years from around 1906 to now
[36:53] making up this last church age and Jesus
[36:56] was saying all of these years even when
[37:00] Pentecost was fiery and when it was
[37:04] spreading like fire he was still saying
[37:07] to this church age I would that you were
[37:09] either hot or cold
[37:10] ah if if you don't make a choice you're
[37:14] gonna be spewed out of my mouth he said
[37:16] in verse 17 for you say I am rich I have
[37:19] prospered and grown wealthy and I am in
[37:21] need of nothing and do realize and
[37:23] understand do not realize and understand
[37:26] you say I'm wealthy and I am in need of
[37:29] nothing and do not realize and
[37:31] understand that you are wretched pitiful
[37:34] or pitiable poor blind and naked
[37:38] therefore I counsel you to purchase from
[37:40] me gold refined and tested by fire I
[37:43] want you to know that there is a truth
[37:47] there is a revelation in the Word of God
[37:50] that is so pure it has been tried and
[37:53] tested by fire and part of that
[37:56] revelation is that the journey continues
[37:59] the word became flesh in Jesus
[38:02] absolutely but but as everything the
[38:05] father was was poured into the Lord
[38:08] Jesus Christ and then everything that
[38:11] was in the Lord Jesus Christ was poured
[38:13] out upon the church on the day of
[38:16] Pentecost and so that's the continuation
[38:20] of the journey now in this spiritual
[38:23] atmosphere of Laodicea many people are
[38:26] just satisfied to
[38:28] just sit around and evidently be naked
[38:30] because the verse goes on to say
[38:32] therefore I counsel you to purchase from
[38:34] me gold refined and tested by fire that
[38:37] you may be truly wealthy and white
[38:39] clothes to clothes you and to keep the
[38:41] shame of your nudity from being seen and
[38:43] salve to put on your eyes that you may
[38:46] see this is Jesus speaking to his church
[38:50] I want to clothe you I want to hide the
[38:53] shame of your nakedness I want to I want
[38:56] to remedy your blindness by anointing
[38:59] you with eye salve this spirit of
[39:03] revelation and understanding so that you
[39:05] can be able to see that Jesus wants to
[39:08] live in you manifesting the same works
[39:15] the same power the same Authority the
[39:20] same spirit it's going to require that
[39:23] same spirit we know that because the
[39:26] Bible said if if that same spirit that
[39:31] raised Jesus from the dead if it dwell
[39:34] in you it shall also quicken your mortal
[39:37] body if we have hope for a new body if
[39:41] we have hope for a change one of these
[39:44] days a glorious resurrection then we
[39:47] will have to be filled filled to
[39:50] overflowing not a trickle but but a
[39:54] flood fill to overflowing with the same
[39:58] spirit that lived in that body of our
[40:02] precious Lord that broken beaten bloody
[40:06] body of our Lord and this is the gift of
[40:10] God this is the continuation of the
[40:13] journey and so we must take sides with
[40:18] the Word of God we must stand in faith
[40:22] with the truth the revelation of who
[40:26] Jesus is in the scripture that we were
[40:29] going to go to a little while ago mark
[40:34] 4:24 finis man has ears to hear let him
[40:37] be listening let him perceive and
[40:39] comprehend and
[40:40] there we stopped now we're moving on
[40:43] verse 24 and he said to them be careful
[40:45] what you are hearing what you're hearing
[40:50] the measure of thought here's the reason
[40:53] why we must be careful what we hear
[40:56] because the measure of thought and study
[40:59] you give to the truth you hear will be
[41:02] the measure of virtue and knowledge that
[41:05] comes back to you and more besides will
[41:08] be given to you who hear so let me
[41:11] remind you that it does matter what you
[41:15] hear there is error out there there are
[41:20] there are messages out there and
[41:23] doctrines out there that do not line up
[41:26] with the continuity of Scripture they
[41:29] don't dovetail with the written record
[41:32] of God's Word I don't care how warm and
[41:36] fuzzy they might make you feel how
[41:38] comfortable and familiar they may be and
[41:41] they may make you feel at home and at
[41:43] ease if they're not according to God's
[41:47] Word then we have an obligation to
[41:51] separate ourselves from those things and
[41:54] again stand with the word take sides
[41:58] with the Word of God so it matters what
[42:02] we hear and it matters how we hear in
[42:05] what attitude in what spirit are we
[42:08] listening because if we have the right
[42:11] spirit and the right attitude concerning
[42:14] the Word of God whether it's what we
[42:15] read or what's delivered to us by
[42:18] teaching or preaching our prophetic
[42:20] utterance if we have the right attitude
[42:22] and spirit toward that word then we open
[42:25] up and we receive it with faith and when
[42:30] we open up to God's Word and we receive
[42:33] truth by faith we study we pray we we
[42:38] connect verse to verse then that
[42:41] revelation expands on the inside of us
[42:45] as we agree with God's Word as we join
[42:49] our faith with God's Word
[42:52] in fact the Scriptures indicate that the
[42:54] more time we spend thinking about the
[42:57] word abiding in that word adding our
[43:01] faith to it then the more revelation we
[43:04] will receive from that word you can't
[43:07] hear a sermon on Sunday and and never
[43:10] reconsider it and expect that that word
[43:13] you heard is going to make a difference
[43:15] in your life I do believe that there's
[43:18] power in hearing the Word of God but I
[43:22] don't think that's just letting it
[43:23] register in the ear I think that hearing
[43:27] is letting it register in the heart so
[43:30] it's not just the physical ear or the
[43:32] physical hearing but it's the opening up
[43:36] of our faith and when we understand that
[43:38] the word comes to us first in seed form
[43:41] and then it is unveiled and revealed and
[43:45] as circumstances line up and as you
[43:52] experience things in your life that take
[43:55] you to another level of maturity you go
[43:58] back and revisit a scripture that you
[44:00] thought you had full understanding of
[44:02] and now because of your growth
[44:05] it doesn't always change what you
[44:08] believed about the scripture but many
[44:10] times it just takes it to a new height
[44:12] or a new depth to a richer and fuller
[44:16] understanding I'd like to say this is a
[44:19] Living Word because it's the written
[44:21] record of a Living Word the Living Word
[44:24] Jesus Christ and because the word is a
[44:26] person and the word is breathing and the
[44:29] word is living and it's in him that we
[44:32] move and breathe and have our being and
[44:34] because of that it's ever-expanding it's
[44:38] going deeper into the areas of our life
[44:41] that we're willing to surrender when we
[44:43] begin to understand that it helps us to
[44:45] see that are there are a lot of passages
[44:47] in the Bible that we can understand a
[44:50] little bit differently
[44:50] for instance the sowing of the seed by
[44:53] the sower and the ground the ground the
[44:57] condition of the ground determined the
[45:00] the future of the seed I I think it was
[45:04] good see
[45:05] but the ground was in different
[45:07] conditions and so how the ground was the
[45:12] condition of the ground determined what
[45:16] happened to the seed what you and I do
[45:18] with God's Word how we apply it how we
[45:22] revisit it how we pray for understanding
[45:25] from it it will absolutely determine how
[45:30] effective that word becomes in our life
[45:33] I want you to know that I'm not in any
[45:35] way talking about big more religious the
[45:38] Word of God does not make us more
[45:40] religious but a living relationship with
[45:44] the Word of God a daily one-on-one
[45:47] individual remember we talked about God
[45:50] living a nation and then God grafting
[45:55] into that nation of people that would
[45:57] love him that would love his word of
[45:59] people that he also loved and yet we
[46:02] still see all of that as a corporate
[46:04] body the church the believers but this
[46:08] thing in the in the end now right now
[46:10] this thing has to be more than has to be
[46:14] about more than just being plugged into
[46:16] a church Universal this has to be a one
[46:20] on one walk with Jesus Christ the word
[46:24] in this hour why are you saying that
[46:26] because of the spirit of the age because
[46:29] of the spirit of the culture Society
[46:32] what's going on around us we've got to
[46:35] know him not just know about him when we
[46:38] when we understand when we begin to look
[46:41] at some of the symbols of Scripture and
[46:43] the parables the stories that Jesus used
[46:46] to teach it wasn't to ultimately conceal
[46:50] the truth it was to cause us to think
[46:54] deeper about what he was saying so that
[46:57] the truth would be revealed it would
[47:01] well we call it progressive revelation
[47:05] revelation that starts and then it gets
[47:10] brighter and brighter and brighter
[47:11] like a woman we call it in the South
[47:15] sometimes drawing the drapes
[47:18] what we mean by that is and I'm sure my
[47:22] kids if I said drawing the drapes they
[47:25] wouldn't know what I'm in but it means a
[47:27] woman going to the to the window in the
[47:30] morning and and pulling the cord to
[47:33] cause the drapes to be drawn the
[47:36] curtains to be drawn to the side so that
[47:40] you can see I know I know now some
[47:44] people have this button you press and a
[47:46] motor Murr you know moves the curtains
[47:49] to the side but in the old days it was
[47:51] like this we just recently were in a a
[47:55] little home a vacation home that we
[47:57] rented in in Arizona of the United
[48:01] States in in the Sonoran Desert
[48:03] beautiful place older home but a
[48:05] beautiful place and there were so many
[48:07] windows in it they had so many of these
[48:10] blinds these these blinds that that can
[48:14] really block out the light but I don't
[48:17] like it that way I like the light and so
[48:19] every morning I'm in there drawing the
[48:22] drapes pulling the blinds open and
[48:23] that's how revelation is it's it's just
[48:26] it's like this it's just unfolding the
[48:29] more we pray into it the more we add our
[48:31] faith to it the more we lean toward it
[48:34] fellowship it speak about it share it
[48:38] read it again
[48:39] write a note in your journal I think
[48:42] God's trying to speak to me from this
[48:44] the more we do that that's also taking
[48:47] sides with the word and the more we do
[48:49] that the brighter the light gets that
[48:51] comes in the window the Bible talks
[48:53] about this in in 2nd Corinthians chapter
[48:55] 3 verse 18 in fact one translation of
[48:59] the Bible translates it this way and we
[49:02] all with unveiled face beholding the
[49:07] glory of the Lord are being transformed
[49:09] into the same image from one degree of
[49:15] glory to another I think King James says
[49:19] from glory to glory but I sure do like
[49:23] the explanation in this translation the
[49:27] way this is described
[49:29] as we all with unveiled face beholding
[49:33] the glory of the Lord are being
[49:35] transformed into the same image from one
[49:38] degree of glory to another it's getting
[49:42] brighter for this comes from the Lord
[49:46] who is the spirit the Lord as we know
[49:50] him the word is spirit form he came in a
[49:55] body but now he lives inside of us in a
[49:59] spirit form and so how do we know more
[50:03] of him how do we fellowship him how do
[50:06] we build relationship with him we can't
[50:08] see him he's inside of us by the Holy
[50:12] Spirit how do we build a relationship we
[50:15] do it in the spirit by the spirit
[50:18] spiritual things are discerned in a
[50:23] spiritual way by the spirit in other
[50:26] words we're not encouraging you only to
[50:29] visit the the written word because you
[50:34] could read this every day of your life
[50:36] and not believe it and be lost it's only
[50:40] when you can attach your faith to this
[50:44] word that it becomes alive in you that
[50:47] is the work of the Holy Spirit that's
[50:49] why we need the Holy Spirit we don't
[50:52] just need theology because theology can
[50:56] be so dry we need the living reality
[50:59] again the letter killeth but the spirit
[51:03] quickeneth the spirit is what makes the
[51:06] word alive to be able to truly embrace
[51:09] who God is and who we are in him and who
[51:17] he desires to be in us that's going to
[51:22] require a work of the Spirit it's going
[51:25] to require a revelation not just an
[51:29] education not just gaining the the
[51:32] knowledge the gnosis but supernatural in
[51:37] the sense that it is revealed to us by
[51:40] the spirit
[51:41] we need another degree of Revelation
[51:44] would you would you agree we need more
[51:47] understanding of God's Word I I just so
[51:51] feel like again that so many people
[51:54] today feel almost as though the Bible is
[51:58] irrelevant
[52:00] just antiquated I hear people saying all
[52:04] kinds of things you know speaking about
[52:08] racism and murder and all the that's all
[52:11] they they're they're reading the Bible
[52:14] with their opinions with with with their
[52:16] mindset and you've got to read the Bible
[52:19] as God's unfolding plan and obviously
[52:24] because Jesus came and fulfilled many of
[52:28] the requirements so many things that we
[52:32] read about in the Old Testament we we no
[52:34] longer have the obligation to stone the
[52:39] person who is transgressing the
[52:41] instruction of God but there's a payday
[52:44] coming there is a reckoning day as we
[52:46] said earlier but it's just not our
[52:48] responsibility to execute the Vengeance
[52:51] of God on the earth that's not our job
[52:54] but but now we have the living reality
[52:57] of the word and we serve Him not because
[53:02] we're afraid of him destroying us but
[53:06] the true believer we serve him because
[53:10] we love him because we know that he
[53:13] first loved us
[53:14] I want you to know that it's not a time
[53:17] to be starchy it's not a time to be a
[53:19] know-it-all
[53:20] it's a time to allow yourself to just be
[53:23] real humble before a great big loving
[53:27] wonderful papa a great father who wants
[53:32] to buy the spirit of adoption he wants
[53:36] to reveal himself to you and I and I
[53:39] believe that that everyone will not
[53:43] overcome I do it doesn't make me feel
[53:47] good to say that I believe there are
[53:49] many who will rather be overcome by the
[53:52] spirit of the age but I do believe
[53:55] that there is a remnant body I believe
[53:58] that the gospel channel will make it
[54:00] possible for many of that remnant body
[54:04] to be reached I believe this is one of
[54:06] the things that God is going to use in
[54:09] the end time to help equip us and to get
[54:13] us ready to be able to recognize our
[54:15] destiny in him I believe that there are
[54:17] many evils in modern technology and
[54:20] internet and television etc but I
[54:23] believe that that truth will also
[54:27] utilize all of these things we talked
[54:32] some time about the the evils and the
[54:34] wackiness of social media but I want you
[54:37] to know God can use social media he is
[54:40] using social media for his purposes is
[54:44] the enemy also using it yes he always
[54:47] will the devil is a hijacker he will
[54:50] hijack anything he can get his hands on
[54:52] to promote his agenda but I tell you
[54:55] something he's about to have a people on
[54:58] his hands
[54:59] that he's not going to know what to do
[55:02] with that may sound very very silly to
[55:05] some of you but I'm telling you it for
[55:07] me it's a promise when God will manifest
[55:10] himself in a mini membered body the
[55:14] bride the remnant of Jesus Christ of
[55:18] Victorious and overcoming people who
[55:22] through no struggle of their own because
[55:25] we're not struggling to get there we're
[55:28] struggling to survive so God can take us
[55:30] there it's not by our earthly striving
[55:33] that we're going to be more yielded it's
[55:36] not by our own works that we're going to
[55:39] come to full redemption it's by taking
[55:42] God at His Word it's by believing and
[55:44] it's about constantly and consistently
[55:48] visiting this precious love story this
[55:54] road map I grew up you know in what you
[55:58] might call a country church where the
[56:00] songs were simple but meaningful
[56:04] I remember one old song and I don't know
[56:07] if you've ever heard it or
[56:08] but I'm using my Bible for a road map
[56:11] that may sound you know who uses a road
[56:15] map today you know who knows what a map
[56:19] is I found out not too long ago that
[56:22] that my children had never really held
[56:26] in their hand a atlas why do you have to
[56:30] because it's it's on your phone and your
[56:33] your GPS is now on your phone or on your
[56:36] watch well I want you to know you can
[56:38] still get the point
[56:40] you've still got some somebody giving
[56:42] you directions to get to somewhere and
[56:45] I'll tell you this this road map is not
[56:47] nearly as confusing as the GPS can be
[56:50] some time I found out that you can plug
[56:53] in the right address and it can still
[56:55] take you to the wrong place but not this
[56:57] one not this one I encourage you this
[57:01] year of your life takes sides with the
[57:04] Word of God in a way that you never have
[57:07] before I pray for you that God will
[57:09] bless you and strengthen you and that he
[57:12] will encourage you and that this will be
[57:15] the year of moving from one degree of
[57:18] glory to the next degree of glory to the
[57:21] next degree of glory until we just move
[57:23] up into his presence I tell you I'm
[57:27] looking for that day when Jesus Christ
[57:30] is fully formed in the life of the
[57:34] believer here on planet Earth maybe not
[57:37] the majority but there's a remnant
[57:39] that's being called maybe some of this
[57:41] has spoken to your heart today it's way
[57:44] more than I intended to share and maybe
[57:46] it's because you're being positioned to
[57:49] be a part of that overcoming body the
[57:52] bride of Jesus Christ who will walk in
[57:55] the full revelation of who he is god
[57:57] bless you thank you for watching
[57:59] pray and support the gospel channel with
[58:02] you will you do that bye bye
[58:04] [Music]
[58:16] [Applause]
[58:19] you
