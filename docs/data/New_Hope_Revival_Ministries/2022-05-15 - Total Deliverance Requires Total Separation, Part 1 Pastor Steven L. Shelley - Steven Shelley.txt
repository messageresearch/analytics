again we are so happy to see you in the house of the lord and we have come to worship our god the living king who is aware of our lives all of the littlest of details that are a part of our lives we may think that we're small in his sight but even the sparrow doesn't fall to the ground but what our lord knows about it and if he's can see the birds he can make sure that they get fed oh how much more those that his very own spirit lives inside of wants to make sure that we're taking care of and fed and all the spiritual food in due season that he has promised to us i am so grateful for his goodness to feed us from the living word the food that will matter most this body is going to rot and it's going to lay in the ground until the time of the resurrection but i tell you when we let the manna of heaven feed the inside of the inside and it's changing us from glory to glory to glory and it's becoming more like him and that there's something going on in the inside that is pulling us closer and closer and closer to our original state to that original plan oh the book of redemption is in the hands of the lamb and i and my name is in that book and i'm being pulled back into my place in the kingdom of god hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory i will press through the veil of his mercy until more of his glory i know thank you lord thank you lord thank you lord sing that course again would you into the presence of jesus david yantis michael christian would you go to the people today for the tithe and the offering as we continue to worship the lord allowing the glory of the lord to do in us what man cannot do but oh when we press in behind that veil the word that is delivered will have such a life-changing effect in us it will have such a different effect because of the way that the gift is being pulled on in the man of god it will have an effect on him and it'll have an effect on you when we're in the right atmosphere for the lord to speak to us sing

laying such a beautiful message for us making us hungry for more oh how we appreciate it we really do i want to say to zach he slipped out now for oh there he is you were anointed hallelujah i just happened to look at a time when his stick slipped out of his hand he never missed a beat he just grabbed it but the tears were there and this i heard him singing that's what caused me to turn don't ever think that you're you're off you all you have to do is play your instrument you've got to worship him you've got to use your words you've got to let your heart be engaged and sometimes people hide behind their instruments or their camera or their responsibility don't do that you don't have to hide from him he hasn't come to kill you he's come to clothe you hallelujah he's come to address you let him do that today but but again thank you for those wonderful messages brother greeley is going to be preaching next sunday for our old friend brother mike sievert and well what's the name of the place in ohio where his church is it is dayton and uh i was there many many years ago remember what a wonderful time we had and uh he's getting a bit older and has fought a lot with his health but he still what's the name of the church that's right house of faith i i knew it was some kind of house i was going to say lighthouse but they are determined that a house of faith remain in that big place of dayton ohio they need a witness don't they they've got to have that there so may god bless those meetings brother greeley i pray the lord will just pour it out on you and give you traveling mercies as you go and visit family on the way let's stand today and go to the word and let's thank god for these musicians nice to see them go but [Applause] sister west it's sure good to see you today thank you for being here appreciate it we don't take it for granted a lot of miles that she drives a lot of miles that brother reed drives to be here a lot of miles that brother miller and sister anna drive to be here and we appreciate it i believe this is brother uh elias's first sunday morning with us is that right were you are you here while i was gone okay so you're you're an old an old fellow here then we don't have to treat you like a guest anymore you just keep making chocolate we'll just keep you here oh you don't need to know about it it's a secret you don't need to know about it anyway moving right along right in the middle of trying to do better there's always tomorrow brother steve and sister beth god made a way i see you're here today i'm so glad god took care of you all when you were on the highway sister beth i know that was hard to be in a situation like that but god is helping i believe god's going to make a way for that vehicle to be repaired they'll quit stealing from him taking advantage of him and somebody fix it and god provide to pay for it to be fixed i've been right where he was where he is i've been there more than once car broke down not enough money to get it all together and not knowing anything i don't know anything he knows some things i don't know anything about mechanics you're at the mercy you're at the mercy but throw yourself on the mercy of god that's what i did and he always made a way and i know he'll make a way for them we couldn't get to them but i know the angels were there i know the lord was helping them genesis chapter 1 i'm going to give you i'm not preaching a sermon this morning i'm going to give you a word from the lord if you have an ear to hear it it's from him to you because he loves you so much and you may wonder god bless you brother stewart also from the uk you may wonder when it's all said and done because it might get a little you know might get a little tight but i want you to know he loves you and he wants to help you he's here today to help us i'm going to need your amens i'm going to do that as you might notice from the amplified charity verse one through five in the beginning god oh that's a big one right there isn't it prepared formed fashioned and created the heavens and the earth the earth was without form and an empty waist and darkness was upon the face of the very great deep the spirit of god was moving moving hovering brooding over the face of the waters brother branham said he was just making love over the water guarding the seed and god said let there be and there was light the jews believed that light was already present it was it had already been created by god because of the way the hebrew reads in genesis 1 they believe that it was commingled with the darkness and that when god called let there be light that the light stepped forward at his command and separated itself from the mixture from the darkness god saw that the light was i thought you'd say tov that word in hebrew is toph and god saw that the light was good suitable pleasant and he approved it and listen at what god did god separated god separated the prophet said the world is a mixer god and his word is a separator we know it's his image we know it's his character because he was doing it in the beginning genesis 1 and god separated the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called and there was evening notice there wasn't morning and evening and that called a day it was evening and morning that was called one day are you still with me turn to x i want you to if you're able to stand if you're not then you have your seat always because god sees your heart and he knows that you're here to pay respects to the word that's why you're here it's because you wanted jesus to have preeminence today and his word but if you a can i want to read all the text while you're standing because i want you to be fully engaged acts chapter 13 beginning in verse 1 we'll read to verse 3. we're back to king james now there were in the church that was at antioch certain prophets and teachers imagine that as barnabas and simeon that was called niger and lucius of sarin and manean which had been brought up with herod the tetrarch and saul i don't know about you but something tells me that was kind of a a motley crew it was kind of a ragtag group of folks there that god has put his hands on there sounds like diversity not diversity and morality but diversity in calling and in position he goes on in verse 2 and they ministered to the lord that is a very important part of ministry we minister first to the lord so that we can minister to the people if i didn't spend time with god this week i'd have nothing worth saying this morning you can't come in here on a spur of a moment and think you're going to have something to feed the body of christ you've got to spend time you also must prepare your heart to be in the presence of god corporately god is an individual god he's not dealing with you like the nation of israel he's dealing with you as individuals you've got to have an experience with him you've got to taste the original manna the pillar of fire has to strike your life they minister to the lord and fasted there's times that it's necessary to separate ourselves from food and from comfort even chocolate on occasion and they minister to the lord and fasted the holy ghost said oh i like that it didn't say paul said didn't say barnabas said didn't say said the holy ghost said we don't even know who god was talking through all we know is that the holy ghost said separate god separated the light from the darkness the holy ghost said in the new testament church separate me barnabas and saul for the work where unto i have called them it's powerful and when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them they commissioned them they anointed them they set them apart as servants of the lord and then they sent them what away now turn to genesis 12. i know you're still standing but i want to catch five verses there genesis chapter 12. i'll never preach this this morning never get to it all because i had prepared an entire 12 pages of notes that's at least two services worth maybe three and this morning lord said you can't preach that until you preach this this has got to be the introduction for that i said all right lord but you'll have to help me i spent all day preparing the message how will i ever get the introduction message number one ready to go in front of message number two but he said he'd help me and he has now the lord said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house brother branham called abraham's father a fly in his soup he said get he apologized for the way it sounded but he said it's he said it he knew something that the bible didn't tell us but a lot of careful research will tell you that abraham's father was an idol maker he made idols and it was not a place for abram to be if he was going to hear from god living in the house of an idol maker walls and shelves of idols and gods and pagan gods and false gods made in images god had to get abraham out of there he said get me out of thy country from thy kindred from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee if it had been me and you we'd have said now what's the name give me the gps coordinates tell me how long it'll take to get there how many lunches i'll need to pack [Music] what kind of what kind of air-conditioned automobile are you going to provide he said and i will make thee of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing i want just a little bit more in the monitor just a little bit more and i will bless them that bless thee [Music] and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed there are so many levels of of of fulfillment that have already taken place in these verses of scripture did you know that the genius of the jewish people living in the land of israel touches the whole world did you know they are leaps and bounds ahead of the health industry in our nation did you know that they are curing lou gehrig's disease in israel unheard of in this nation and that it can be done the machines and the things needed can be done for just a little bit of money and yet it'll be years some of us will never live long enough to see it available in this nation something's very seriously wrong did you know they have created robotic aid in israel that can take a paraplegic or quadriplegic man pick him up out of the bed without the help of a man pick him up out of the bed strap him in and allow him to move freely throughout the house and not only that they have created a robotic machine that that you can someone can strap you in and it will restore your ability to walk and move your arms and feed yourself as long as you've got that device on and i could go on and on and on and on and on and on even the even the uh what we call what's that stuff we call uh when when uh liquid stitches or something what do they call that when people get cut liquid band-aid or something like that that that is knock-offs of what they've got in israel they can go right into a battlefield where a man is blown half open and they've got they've got bandages like no other and they've got liquid like that like no other to be able to put somebody back together and give them a greater chance of life so we can say already the whole world has been blessed because abraham abram heard the word of the lord and he got away from his comfort zone and that which was familiar and his father's house and his kindred and his land and he said god just show me where to go and i'll go he departed as the lord has spoken unto him and lot went with him his nephew is that right and abram was 75 years old when i hear people say i guess i'm too old to do that now i guess i'll never live long enough to do what i thought i wanted to do or what i was supposed to do don't tell abram that what a sad confession you're making anyway 75 years old before he ever left his father's house to go do what he was supposed to do and he he he was about to yet father children abram departed and the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and abram was 75 years old when he departed out of haran and abram took sarah his wife and lord his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of canaan the land of canaan and into the land of canaan they came now we want to pray right now father we thank you that you are god's sovereign your your presence has been so real i don't want to i don't want to step on it i don't want to i don't want to cause it to to withdraw but i want to step into a channel it doesn't have to be loud it doesn't have to be fast i'm not asking for any particular favorite anointing i'm just asking you to come lord and help me deliver the word of the lord if i believe that this word was only for those here this morning we'd shut off the cameras and shut off the stream and we would close in and just preach to us but i believe lord that you may use this word beyond this house and i'm asking you to anoint our ears wherever we may be right now to hear this word and apply it to our lives and we will give you glory and honor and praise for it's in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray and the church said amen you may be seated don't run don't run away just hang out here with us and let's see what the lord will do we'll have fellowship later and great time together i want to preach a message that i had to re-title it was to be called total deliverance i believe in it i'm not one of those who believes that there are just things we're stuck with and we can't get help from them i believe if it's there and it hinders you and bothers you and god didn't put it on you it can get off of you we can pray it off you can pray it off you can be delivered from it if anybody believes that say amen if god has put it on you i don't want to be guilty of trying to get it off of you and there are times that god puts things on people to hold them in a place until he's ready to move them beyond yes i've told you before i believe with all my heart that god puts his hand on people sometime out in sin and holds them there because he doesn't want him to have to go through the pain of religion and the hurt of church until they're strong enough until things have so shifted that they would be able to come in and get the help and the deliverance that they need church is splitting and shifting and all kinds of things going on it's no environment sometime for new believers to come and find the lord so he just holds them there somebody said i just can't even i just can't even embrace something like that i know i know your god's not sovereign mind is sovereign mind created the darkness just like he created the light mind created evil just like he was the good that's the sovereign god i serve my my god allows things to come on us sometime to hold us in a position of a holding pattern before while we get honed in and matured and knocked around a little bit iron sharpening iron for the service of the lord i hope you're with me and i was going to call this just just simple brother branham preached a message like that a total deliverance once and i love it i love that message i could just play it this morning and we'd all be blessed by it because we all need some of that and that's what i was going to preach on and then i woke up this morning and the lord said no no you can't have total deliverance until you have total separation from unbelief because unbelief in any form will stand between you and a total deliverance that makes a lot of sense doesn't it it should god said it so i want to call this series i i hope it's not one of them long ones but i want to call because i want to get to the punch line it grieves me to think i won't get to it this morning but i want to title this total deliverance requires total separation the two sermons that brother branham preached along those lines i told you one was called a total deliverance the other one was entitled god's word calls for a total separation from unbelief so you can just combine those thoughts together and we'll see where we will go this morning i'd like to read from the message the patriarch abraham are you with me good good good i'm glad now abraham was just an ordinary man he wasn't something special i'm already having church i love this i love it because in our mind we think there are superheroes born and that's the one god uses the ones that have no problems the ones that have rosy upbringings good mamas good daddies that's the one god uses ones that have no nervous problems no threat never had a panic attack you know those super people that only live in the movies i've never been blessed to pastor many of those the folks i know are the ones that have been beat up battered and shook up the ones that have been through suffering and heartache and trial that's one of the reasons why they can embrace the word for the hour because their plow their field got plowed up the clouds of dirt got broke up so that god could sow his seed amen it takes that kind of a ragtag like david's champions david's great men those who separated themselves unto david they they come up there they they look like a a craziest looking army you'd ever seen some big and some little here comes some big giant of a man said david i'm with you here comes some little skinny skinny skinny man david i'm with you some big tall man damn some little short man david one here probably comes stuttering couldn't even hardly introduce himself but he got it now i'm with you what an army to us it doesn't sound like much of a polished army but i want you to notice what was needed in the hour somebody willing to be separated for a purpose for a cause unto a god i'm not just preaching about what we need to be separated from i'm also preaching about what we need to be separated unto somebody say unto because that's the greatest part of sanctification it's not what god has called you away from it's what god's called you into he's called you into christ anybody with me all right so abraham was just an ordinary man wasn't something special i think the prophet said he had hooked nose that's a little derogatory in our society today but i'm guilty sometime of saying i believe that man's jewish i believe i believe that man's jewish so we do that sometime there's no animosity in my heart when i say it in fact my thoughts and respect toward that person go up they don't go down all right now god never called him as far as we have a record until he was 75 years old we don't even know that he was hearing the voice of god until he got hard of hearing down here because sometimes you got to get a little hard of hearing to be able to hear his voice because it won't be the loudest necessary it might be the quietest it might be the most mysterious but we've got to have an ear that is tuned to hear the voice of god stay with me got a lot of waiting to do to get where we're going his wife which was his half-sister being 65 years old at the time they had probably lived together since they were very young since they were related and she was barren had no children 10 years younger we know god called a complete separation how many of you know by the time you're 75 you say yeah well people live longer well by the time you're 75 you've sort of drawn you've sort of drawing your circle and these are the people you're going to settle down with you you already picked out your your uh retirement life and what it's going to look like maybe and and and you're just kind of ready to sit on the porch and rock your wife calls you a uh shut-in and a recluse and says you just don't want to be you just want to be a homebody but by the time you're 75 you have earned the right to be a little bit of a homebody but god said to abram one day you're gonna have to give me a complete separation to separate himself from the rest of the world and from all of his people and from all of his kindred there was a special thing for him to do and when god expects you to do a special thing he demands a complete separation read it from any doubt you've got to come to full obedience to obey what he says god does what demands it you can't do it no other way you can't do it no other way total obedience total separation from unbelief now remember this is not to condemn anybody when you get in that place and you recognize that unbelief is creeping into your life almost every single day you live on planet earth don't tell me no don't tell me no all you have to do is record your talk just record what you say we don't talk like people that have separated ourselves from total unbelief we talk like people that are in the throes of despair oh yes i've been there in the valley of despair where the only way out is up look up and live but rise above the desolation joy without reservation for the power of god the word of god is in the inner man remember singing that so we've all been in the valley of despair we've all been in the hard trial but we are to be a people who have the ability to touch the grace of god and to speak the truth of god's word into every situation that we face i was reading some transcripts this week of some sermons that were preached here and one sunday the man of god came to the pulpit to preach to us and here is what he said he said i don't want to offend you but god just said this was in the middle of a series on the mind and he said i don't want to offend you but god just said some of you will never do this because you're too lazy [Music] that wasn't very encouraging the word i thought who is this man of god who does he think he is standing in my pulpit saying something like that you really can't be too harsh on him though when you look down and recognize you are him it was me who said it i remembered it well when i read it how the lord had dealt with me that morning and he said the people are getting weary of the preaching that you're doing on the mind because it looks so overwhelming to them and said so you tell them that as long as they're lazy they'll never be able to practice this but when they make up their mind that it's life or death to think right [Applause] life or death to think right it's life or death to think right it's life or death to talk right come on now then they'll get over some of that laziness and they'll say if i have to wrestle every thought every single thought that comes to exalt itself against the knowledge i'll wrestle it all down i'll pull it all down i'll cancel it all i'll stop mid-sentence if that's what i have to do because it's worth it to think right and to talk right are you with me he demands a complete separation from any doubt you've got to come to full obedience to obey what he said god demands it you can't do it any or no other way and now he always sets an example do you believe that and that was his example of a complete separation from all of his family from all of his kindreds and so forth to walk a life separated to god the reality is everyone will not pay this price the reality is if you don't you won't walk in the blessed favor of the lord amen it's just the reality it's just the reality you got to stay with the word no matter what happens and you've got to be willing at time to walk away from all that is unlocked the word because that stuff will get on you it'll get on you it'll get on somebody you love no words have to be spoken somebody said well there you know i was in an atmosphere and and nothing negative was even said you don't understand do you spirits are more contagious than the common cold now sister andy i i didn't just you know let you share what you were sharing but but i held on to it because i wanted to share it for you and and i did it because you were looking at it one way in the natural and spiritual too but i was seeing it as something that we had already discussed this morning when i woke up this morning and god began to give me this you're not going to have a total deliverance until you have a total separation from all unbelief when god began to deal with me like that i don't know why he did but before i ever got out of bed he took me to the little children and and i began to pray over the little children in our church we are so blessed i told the musicians when we met in my office to pray before the service we are so or i told the lord in their presence we are so blessed we've got some of the most amazing kids around here that i've ever come in contact with in my whole life and even if they get on your nerves they're amazing and you realize they're they're they're just far above and beyond what the world is producing you just have to realize the uniqueness of them they're they're they're they're like a different race altogether than normal children that you see out there in the world they're just special all of them no i'm not just talking about one i'm talking about all of them god loves them all boys and girls and it makes me mad mad mad i guess if my voice breaks like that it don't sound very mean does it mad it makes me mad to think that the enemy would try to put something on one of them you know instead of picking on somebody his own size somebody that's got the word on him somebody that knows what a what a you know we don't have to start calling him names i'm not afraid to but we don't have to start calling him names he knows exactly what he is and and it's one thing for him to pick on somebody that's got the word to slap him back with it or to give him a good boo devil but to try to put something on some of these children to affect their behavior or to touch their little bodies or to cause them to to be in such a way that it affects their social interaction with one another now that makes me mad mad and i remembered this morning and i hope this doesn't get too close to home but i some times in my in my life in my years of ministry here we don't have to go back further than here where there have been some situations where little children would come under something their behavior changed their sleep pattern change and their demeanor and their social interaction changed with other children and parents or grandparents would bring them to me to pray for or to talk to and at least two times in the past 10 years we were able by the mind of the spirit to discern and call it out and do something about it that it was related to something mama or daddy was doing in the home now that is not to condemn anybody but it's to show you that that even in the privacy of your own home you can do certain things and it affects your children because that's how spirits operate this is tough preaching now i knew it'd be a little hard at times i'm just getting started so help me now while you can and uh i mean little little little odd things i don't want to say them i don't want to say them but little odd things a child at an early age with an unusual curiosity about things and you find out that mom or dad how also had a overwhelming curiosity about things and they were doing things on the computer and on their phone that they shouldn't be doing and that stuff was being channeled into the atmosphere of the home and all the prayer times and hallelujah praise the lord couldn't keep that influence out of that home because somebody had opened up a door [Music] the only way to solve that problem is to shut that door and then to pray that residual off of that child if you're not going to disciple your children in the faith if you're not going to be on guard for their welfare spiritually and naturally i'm going to tell you something that will draw criticism for myself don't have them when my wife and i married we didn't practice birth control because i came from a group of people that didn't practice birth control no we were not catholics we were pentecostal believers and we didn't practice birth control so nine months later after our honeymoon we had our first we did that it wasn't exactly what we expected but we knew the the risk was certainly there there's no way in the world now listen carefully this is for you i know it won't be popular there's no way in the world i was going to put my wife on birth control pills why because i love her too much watch how tight it gets there's no way in the world i was going to do that i wouldn't do that now if i was just starting out like some of you are no way in the world because you see the message i believe god gave a word to a prophet to explain to him that these kinds of adjustments to natural hormones can cause cancer so it was a no-brainer for me when the doctor said to my daughter who suffers with i'm not going to give it a name but these cysts and tumors in her ovary and and multiple times they have popped and she's passed out cold we didn't talk about it in church we've said very little about it i think we asked prayer for her once but we knew that it was not something in that atmosphere at that time that we could talk about because we understood that it was also a spiritual attack and so we wanted to deal with that and so when the doctor said that could be almost knocked out with a birth control pill it was a no-brainer for us we had absolutely no intention of doing that because we know what that can do for a woman and breast cancer all you have to do is read the warning is right there so there had to be other ways so i'm not just preaching something from my old pentecostal background i'm telling you there are natural reasons why these things should should be done carefully with all of that being said let me say to you if you're not going to stay with these children and raise them in the fear of god and protect them from the things that come to harm them if you're going to open up the door by letting the world come right in come on now and entertain your children instead of the bible story if you're going to let marvel do it amen what you can handle and what they can handle may be something different but you bring that into the in the atmosphere of your home you're opening a door there's some times that we have to say hey what i used to do i can't do right now maybe never do again but right now i've got to understand and i want you to know something as these things go along they're going to get worse and worse now brother daniel preached that he was being rough he was being rough i believe in being rough i believe there's times to be rough and somebody went out there to the to the to the fellowship place where we were eating and kind of mocked it said wasn't that a marvelous message because he was referring to the influence of the marvel movies and the superhero movies and things like that i want you to know something i'd be very careful if that's not your conviction you have your own but i'd be very careful how i let my tone be about that when someone was bringing a warning and felt like there was something that they should say and that's what i'm doing today i'm telling you these things are easily transferred so when you start getting to the bottom of them you're going to want to make sure that every door is closed you're going to want to make sure that everything is dealt with you need to make sure mom and daddy don't have pornography problems you better you better make sure that they're not staying up all night playing games and doing things they have no business to do while their wife is laying in the bed somewhere asleep chatting with people on these games and doing things like that is a very dangerous thing it's like snapchats and all the rest i'm moving off of this i'm moving off of this but it makes me so mad sometimes that little bit of children innocent children have to deal with things because we make poor decisions for their welfare god help us i've also had parents to come and say to me brother shelly i felt something coming against me like i hadn't felt in years and i realized that a grown child in my home or a teenager in my home was doing things and involved in things and opening doors into things they had no business and here i am unaware and all of a sudden that kind of thing was coming against me and i had to cry out for help and some have even said pastor pray for me because i've got to overcome that thing and i've got to see how to do it god's word calls for total separation from unbelief a total deliverance can only come when there has been a total separation from unbelief i don't know if i'm getting any amens virtually here but i'm preaching anyway now i want to get off of that but i just want to tell you that those things are so easily transferred and sometimes what we think is very innocent behavior and innocent interaction can actually cause a child to struggle or cause them to come under or an adult cause them to struggle and not know why i don't want you to have this mindset that as long as nothing bad is [Music] sad that there's nothing involved i know people that have had to separate themselves from their walking partners from their from their teacher companions from their not because of things that were being said but because of influence you see you sometimes carry it to church with you and that's not fair to the rest of us anybody with me now you can take this as a pastor trying to stir the hornet's nest or you can take it like god gave it it's a word from the lord for this body and let me just ask you this way who in this house would desire a total deliverance in your life just hold up your hand then there's a price abraham had to pay a price isaiah brother branham i'll read in a minute he said isaiah he said all the prophets had to pay this prize and believers today must pay the same price and we did some of us have had to do that from our many of our denominational friends and so forth it's been a it's been a tough a tough way to go when the truth comes they like to mock what they don't understand they like them all sometimes they do understand it because they were in it they were in some of it they went through some of it some of them came out of pentecost stricter than what pentecost is today come on now are you still with me and when god expects you to do this is paragraph five the patriarch abraham and when god supper expects you to do a special thing we're going backward here just a minute he demands a complete separation from any doubt you've got to come to full obedience to obey what he says god demands it you can do it no other way abraham and his seed after him paragraph 86 we started reading that now now and then notice as soon as abraham believed god by justification he said believing on the lord were justified immediately god called abraham to total separation from all unbelief before he would give him the holy ghost before he had any kind of experience uh with a supernatural god he just calls him out and abraham answers a god that he don't even know his name who are you he just hears a voice abram abram gets he out you know it takes faith to follow a voice that you don't know to serve a god that you don't know but abraham had lived with idols he grew up with false gods he grew up with imitation so somehow in the midst of all of that fanaticism and then all of that imitation he heard a true voice oh it spoke to him and abram was willing to obey god so just as soon as he was justified believing on the lord immediately god called abraham to total separation from all unbelief he said is that the way he did in you it's a question separate yourself from your kindreds from all your associates come out of the pool rooms [Music] i had a pastor tell me in this message i got some that go to the pool halls they don't gamble anymore and they don't drink anymore but they just love the game of pool i'm not going to say a word against the game of pool i don't care for it it's not something i enjoy but i happen to know there are people in this room very good at it and i wouldn't touch their lives with a 10-foot pole but i will tell you this they don't go to the pool hall to play it need some help they don't go down with their old associates to play it oh i'm just going down there to be a light i just drink my coca-cola while they're drinking their rum and coke i'm just going down there to be a blessing i'm just going down now to be a witness let me tell you something if god sends you to the pool hall he's probably going to send you with your bible under your arm and your leather girdle on he's probably going to send you in like a john the baptist you're probably not going to go in making friends [Applause] now that being said he did send me one time when i was still in high school and no i didn't wear a leather girdle but i went with all the mentors in my life to guard me and to watch over me because i knew the lord has sent me there for a specific purpose and that was to reach out to the woman who was there to entertain some of you have heard me tell the story of meeting an entertainer by the name of bigfrida wallace and god sent me to her she's dead but god sent me to her and when i knew that god was speaking to me and giving me a vision and telling me where to go and how to find her i went to my school teacher at the christian school and his brother my principal and i said i have found where she is i'm going to see her and i want you all to go with me as as my protectors and as my guards because i don't want to be caught up in anything that's not for me so there's a right way and i'll have to tell that that story another time no it's not in my notes when i walk in there this big old woman is i mean big folks big they didn't call her big free to wallace for nothing big and she had a piano bar that they brought in a truck a grand piano bar with a ledge around it and she was singing them all him them old songs not hims yet the closest she got to him i hear him telling that story she sung just a bowl of collard greens i said that ain't gonna get it lord you're gonna have to give me an opportunity to talk to her room full of people at tables and she looked right down there at me and winked at me and she said what in the world is a nice guy like you doing in a place like this on the microphone and she said i got a feeling you could sing a song or two for us why don't you do it hallelujah so in my senior year of high school we had revival down at the piano bar but i knew that i had an appointment to go and i had guards in place to go you don't want to go back to your old hates and your old hearts and your old bodies you want to know that you know that you know that you've risen above the pool that has once enslaved you he said come out of the pool room come out of the dance halls come away from the things of the world god calls for a total separation to abraham's seed you may not be abraham's natural seed but you're a part of the royal seed of abraham and he said he's called that's what he called abraham to and that's what he's calling us to now if you'll give me the message there's a lot of yawning on going on in here i'm so sorry that you're feeling sleepy and i'm gonna i'm gonna for being there i didn't see him particularly but we would cut him a little slack if he had the yawn because he worked all night last night and uh but kendra pinch him hard as you can if he dozes off i mean just do like maul used to do me and get under there and don't don't stop twisting until your arm won't go no further and he'll wake right up genesis 13 this is a lot of reading here god bless you that you that are joining us now from zambia god bless you and lord also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together i don't know if you remember this or not but years ago i preached a message here called anybody remember the seven separations of abraham now i know jennifer stark you weren't here when i preached the message seven separations of abraham so somebody had to share that with you seven things that god called abram to separate himself from so that he could do what god called him to do and and listen to how it sounds god called him out from his kindred in his father's house but let him take a lot with him and the word here says in just a minute the prophet said god couldn't bless him god couldn't bless him because he hadn't paid the full price of obedience god said get away from your kin folk don't drag them all with you powerful he said the land was not able to bear them they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together read on and there was strife between the herdsmen of abram's cattle and the herdsmen of lot's cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land and abram said in the lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethren it's not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me now the first time god told abraham to separate himself and to come and now with him has come his nephew and the time has come now that abraham instead of saying i can't carry you any longer we can't dwell like this anymore he looks at his nephew lot and he says separate thyself from me there comes a time that separation has to look like that you go your way and i'll go my way and we will remember fondly the times we had together there just won't be no more anybody with me if i'm making this say something it shouldn't say you correct me at the end but better hear everything i'm going to read before you do it's not the whole land so he said if thou will take the left hand separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou will take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left and lot lifted up his eyes and i want you to know in this moment of separation the decision that he was about to make not in separating himself it was the will of god that they separate themselves but he had a decision to make he had to choose what to do with his inheritance [Applause] i think it's clear to you and i in this hour of life when we walk through life that decisions we make not only affect us but they affect our posterity they affect our children our inheritance they affect those who come behind us don't you think that god doesn't see that don't you think that god doesn't know about that don't you think that god's not able to break through that he can break through that he can redeem that but you better keep your hands off of what god's doing you can't pray off what god's putting on anybody with me okay so he said lot lifted up his eyes and he was about to make us abraham said i don't care you go that way i'll go this way or you go that way i'll go that way it doesn't matter to me what my inheritance is abraham didn't have to worry whoa about our abram he didn't have to worry about what his inheritance was going to look like he had a promise but that promise was never going to be fulfilled until he had totally separated himself from unbelief jesus said if you mourners will just get out of the room here i'll take care of this little girl if you all would just get your unbelieving your carrions on out of here you paid professional mourners i think i go to church with some sometime professional mourners carry every burden carry every situation you carry only what god lays on you don't you go around carrying illegal burdens if it's not your burden you let somebody else carry it if you carry everybody's burden you will wear yourself down only the burden god assigns to you [Music] boy that's we're getting some practical help here for listening now he goes on you know lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plains of jordan that it was well watered everywhere oh my his eyes are getting looking beautiful down there before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt is thou comest unto zoar then lot chose him all the plains of jordan why because he looked down so how fertile they were oh he wasn't a dumb businessman he knew exactly what he was doing i'm going to secure a good future for my folks and he chose the plane of jordan the worst decision of his life it cost him his wife it cost him the innocency of his daughters like the man standing on my front porch years ago they said don't you worry brother shelly we're leaving the church because we feel like god has called us out but the next time you see us you won't see any difference in us at all my wife will still have long hair she'll still wear her skirt my daughters will still have long hair and they'll still weld their skirt and you'll be proud of us it wasn't even 30 days was that man lying to me no he thought that he had his inheritance under his protection but he didn't understand that he was taking them out from under another head that god had ordained over them for that moment of protection in their life and in doing so it threw them to the wilds of the enemy all we can do is pray for somebody like that he really thought i could protect them lot probably thought i'm making the best choice by going separation had to happen the separation had to happen abraham couldn't inherit his promise with lot hanging around but lot chose the wrong direction to pitch his tent to war didn't he a lot then lot okay go on separated themselves one for another abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and look what he did now how many homeless preachers ever preached this line and pitched his tent towards sodom toward hollywood toward california he just pitched his tent in the direction of the filth and the smut he got his eyes on the on the flashing lights of uh of sodom and gomorrah and he said my my won't my wife love the beauty parlor of sodom and want my daughter's love all the pampering and and spa treatment that they can get down there in sodom won't they love the manicures i didn't say there's nothing wrong with taking care of your fingernails but you go in a place like that and they talk you into painting them and you've got the spirit of the world after you you're going to have to make up your mind that god's word calls for a total separation from all unbelief you can't look like the world and smell like the world and act like the world and belong to christ in this last hour i know that preaching is too hard for some on the internet but i know it's not too hard for this house come on now i'm not trying to be a fanatic i'm just trying to tell you it matters so we pitched his tent towards sodom and he didn't listen he didn't move to sodom he just started easing in that [Music] she just trimmed her bangs she just trimmed the length because everybody knows the split ends if you don't do something about them [Music] because there are still people in this world so dumb they think the hair grows from the ends and not from the roots i've had people in this room some i love arguing me over something like that i'm not buying well i read on google i don't care what you read on google your hair don't grow down here it grows from up here if you want to do something to help it grow you do something up here you get some good vitamins and some good treatment or something and you do something take care of it that way but keep the scissors out of it [Music] they came here the jacksonites came here they did they came here years ago stood on the porch of the old church and told me that they had now a revelation that as long as it was an inch at a time or a half an inch at a time that it would be all right and that's why when you see those folks today it's up to the shoulder and blue because that little bit of compromise sets you up whoa boy i used to preach that and they would shout down the aisle they'd think they had reached the sunny banks of sweet deliverance but now you preach a little like that and what happens even people that believe it won't aim in it because you're afraid somebody will hear you or somebody will see you on the internet the truth is the truth is the truth is the truth is the truth is the truth whoa all right let's go on now abraham dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards sodom but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lip oh let's don't miss that and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him now you're about to get the full blessing lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward for all the land which thou seest whoa all of it for all the land which thou see seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed forever don't you tell me that israel is occupying the land don't tell me that they're squatting on the land that belongs to palestinians i'll show you right here in the word but every bit of it from the land from the mountain from moray all the way across as far as the eye can see scripture says clean to the euphrates it's theirs i'll give it to you and your seed forever and you know what they probably thought they had it in the bank let's put in a pocket they didn't know they were gonna have to fight for it and fight for it and fight for it and fight for it and every year we were gonna come to a screeching halt in a moment of silence to honor the tens of thousands who have died trying to protect the promise that god gave to abraham it matters and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered arise and walk through the land in the length of it and the breath of it for i will give it unto thee just step on it abram stab on it let your sandals walk all over it keep your eyes off sodom and don't cry another tear over light put your faith in the promise and abraham removed his tent and came and dwelt in the land of memory which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord and if you go to israel and you're able to get into hebron you're not always able to get in there you weren't always able to get in there in times past when i was there in 1977 is that right 79 thank you i knew it didn't sound right when i was there in 1979 they started shooting at our bus in 79 and we had to take the curb and the sidewalk and i was 11 years old and that bus took that curb that sidewalk and began to knock out orange stands and banana stands i tell you it was the most exciting thing that happened to me in my little life the bus shaken as them as some bullets was hitting the side of the bus but it was an armored bus we didn't know it until they come on them said don't worry unless something fails they got us out of there why because it's disputed land today right there in hebron is the tomb of abraham isaac and jacob so god allowed his bones to lay there where the promise was made to him i think that's pretty powerful i won't get on that if i did i'd have to share the experience i i've been putting some things together chronologically for myself to make my life a little easier i've been working on it some this week and i've been reading some stuff and i'm thinking my what a oh oh my what we have to look forward to [Music] and i read that experience where god allowed us to carry the bones of the prophet back to the city that he loved so dearly and i began to read the promises attached to that i said lord i want my part of that i want my part of that if others decide not to have their part i want my part and i'll take their part too all right we've got some promises here now let's go on i i'm i've got to hurry it's 1 13. where were we charity oh that's the end of it isn't it which is in heaven and build there an altar unto the lord okay that's right we'll go right into abraham's seed paragraph 25 abraham like god called those things which were not as though they were anything contrary to god's promise was a lie to abraham i remember them sitting in my office and telling me now we all have come to understand and believe that this place will never be filled oh no we haven't no we haven't i haven't come to that place that's why we laid that that's why we laid that floating floor on the studio when god said this is a time that's why we laid it right we didn't cut no carpet out we laid it right on top of the carpet it may not look pretty but if we ever need to take them walls out we know exactly how to get them out we know exactly how we know it's not about number and it's not about pack-a-pew and we're not going to give anybody a cable subscription for bringing the most people to church like some of the denominational churches do can you imagine giving somebody a year's cable giving somebody a year of cable tv because they brought the most people to sunday school don't folks just surprise you with their stupidity we're not going to do that but we believe that as god begins to fulfill his word we'll have to make preparation i got to hurry abraham like god called those things that were not as though they were anything contrary to god's promise was a lie to abraham if it didn't fit the promise abraham said that's a lie that's a lie whoa you want to make your family mad that's a lie that's a lie i don't hear that that don't fit the promise ain't got no time for that up in here that don't fit the promise i'm hanging my life on the promise anything contrary to god's promise was a lie to abraham anything contrary so then when abraham started out when god called him you're still with me everybody now watch the first thing god did to abraham was call an absolute separation exactly you've got to separate yourself from all unbelief get away from it that's it you've got to get away from unbelief god called abraham to separate himself from his kindred from everything that he had that he might walk with him give him a strange land i'm looking over there dana give him a strange land that's the way every sinner when he gets saved he comes into a strange land or when someone's calling some body when god's calling somebody to another place to follow him you can follow god wherever god plants you i don't mean to say it that way but when god calls you to follow you better follow when he says go you better go and he says stay you better stay and you better not check with too many god's will may not be a consensus it may not be a majority oh strange land this is what i'm trying to get to among strange people do i ever feel the need sometime to explain us i do but i don't i do but i don't i feel sorry for some of the people you all invite you bring them in here you don't tell them anything about us they come in blind they think they're coming into a methodist meeting they don't have any idea they don't know they're coming a bunch of tongue talking pew jumping i'll running flag waving amen screaming [Applause] word of god living [Applause] i don't have any idea he said that's the way he comes into a strange land among strange people god calls for a separation now move on uh jehovah jireh number one in in louisville mississippi paragraph 42 he said another thing he told him to do to separate himself from his kindred and all of his people god in order to get a man or a woman boy or girl to obey him you have to separate yourself from all unbelief that's right until you totally separate yourself from anything contrary to that word and believe it you god calls for a total separation are you still with me just a minute my page is stuck together all right move on now to the faith of abraham paragraph 42. it's a lot of reading but i want you to hear it now god said then abraham in order to walk with me you've got to separate yourself from the rest of him god demands a total separation but you want to bring a lot of the world along with you when you come in and receive the holy ghost you say well i was taught to be this and i was taught the days of miracles past you better leave that thing alone you better leave that thing alone as long as that holds with you it'd be like abraham started out with lot and his father there's trouble in the camp and god never did bless abraham until he separated himself and done what god told him to do he couldn't come with his father out he couldn't come with his nephew out he had to come out and he had to leave everything else on the other side let god deal let me tell you something god knows how to deal with our loved ones now i'm not i want you to know i'm not telling you not to have anything to do with your family that is not what i'm preaching here but i'm telling you you should be very very very careful what kind of a spirit you were around and if i were you i wouldn't be volunteering myself and submitting myself to that over and over and over again i'd be very wise i'd be very careful and i certainly wouldn't send my children into that amen and god never did bless abraham until he separated himself and done what god told him to do and you'll listen god woke me up this morning he said you cannot preach a total deliverance until you preach a total separation now this was not i'm telling you this was not before i was ever out of bed usually i get up go to the dining room table i usually put my mouse and my pad mouse pad and my uh wrist pad that i use to keep my wrist from hurting i usually have all that laid out on the downroom table i'm ready to come make the finishing touches i've looked at it usually all week long i've got enough i'm i could come right then with more than some people could come with do do come with but i want to know i want to know i want to know and before i ever got out of bed my wife said did you rest well we ask each other that every morning did you sleep good it's always wonderful when we both say yes but it's rare and i said i don't think so uh i know i was sleeping some but i know when i wasn't sleeping i was awake she knows my language i chuckled when i said it but all i could what i meant to say was and what i could have said was i remember being awake a lot things were just rolling over a couple of people reached out to me last night i'm praying for you asking god to use you tomorrow and help you and last night and i appreciated that because i was sensing the pressure of preaching on a total deliverance i felt like it's necessary and it is necessary and we're going to get to it but then when i woke up this morning i started feeling like that there was something else and i started just meditating on the lord and he started talking to me and my wife said well what did you see what did you get what did you hear in the night what's what what was it and i said i can't talk about it right now because i'm already trying to pull some things together from this morning from for the to add to the message for this morning and this was that this whole section because if we are going after a total deliverance we should not expect it without a price it's going to cost us something it's going to cost us something god never did bless abraham until he separated himself and done what god told him to do and you'll never receive the holy ghost in the fullness you'll never walk in the spirit of god until you totally separate your things from unbelief get away from the world come out of the world i know you think i'm crazy but if i am just letting me alone he said i'm happy this way i'd rather be like this than the way i was see i looked at my sacrifice one time how many of you have ever seen your sacrifice thank god i've seen him and then separation the world wants mixers mixers ecumenical mixers everybody together just pull everybody together we had somebody here once nicest fella nicest fella some of you really enjoyed this company and his fellowship some people didn't understand when we put the pressure on from the pulpit while we begin to tell people you can't hang out in the vestibule if you come to church you need to come in here and see it you can't hang out there and mix with the little ones a lot of people didn't understand it because they hadn't been spending their nights on the floor seeking the lord and when he spoke to me i went to this man and i confronted him with what god said he never denied he never denied what was said he couldn't deny what was said there's no way in the world he could but he said then i'll just pull myself away because i don't want to be a danger that was a hard thing because my answer was we can cast this thing off a man lives alone has only his music his tv his computer it's just like sitting in sodom the filth and the smut and the vile grossness my wife said to me years later when the man took his life why didn't you tell the people what you saw and what you what you said and what transpired i said he wouldn't let me he wouldn't let me the lord wouldn't hit me i asked him multiple times prayer would be requested for the fellow and and and with the best of my ability i would pray a man like that left to his own devices you say well wouldn't that be better to for a man like that to come and hang out in a good atmosphere it would be if it wasn't for the vileness and the danger of the spirit that had taken hold i want you to understand that we all can have discerning of spirits but we are not all called to be watchmen on the wall when we have that call and there's more than one in this house and when we have that call we better do what god tells us to do whether it's understood or not one of these days you're going to understand a lot of things you don't understand now when that veil is lifted and you see what how close we have come to missing at times there's got to be something to take us all the way he even told us how it would come he even told us what it would look like how he would carry us to the top he told us once when we didn't have the strength to go he would provide the fire that we needed to be strengthened to go on he said when we were not able to go any higher when we couldn't do it by herself he would help us didn't he anybody with me he told us how he would help us he told us how an eagle would take us spiritually the prophet knew it he saw it coming he was in shreveport he saw things were coming to an end he's sharing his experience in sabino he knew that god was not going to forsake his people when he took his prophet he knew that the spirit of truth would remain in the bride he knew there would be something to catch us up above the mixers i got to close the world wants mixers oh when you elect your new pastor you say we want that little curly hair you know nothing wrong with curly hair but don't you notice sometimes how men with curly hair like to show it they like to kind of work down come on you know the prophet talked about these beatniks and his day and how they like to pull their bangs down on their forehead you know sometimes put them in spit curls remember big curl of hair there was a pentecostal preacher used to run through here uh you know you related to some folks you know he pulled his spit curl down there a big curl of hair right down on his my granny would say to me i love that man i love his singing i love his preaching but she said i cannot trust a man that pulls his bangs down in a spit curl on his forehead she said he thinks too much of himself and here brother random come along said about the same thing whew god didn't didn't decide to deliver the message by dobby gillis he wasn't looking for a beatnik he was looking for a redneck he went to kentucky he found somebody that had no pretense come on now wasn't trusting his education daddy a bootlegger running from the law moved every time the bills come due god knew what he was doing separation the world wants mixers oh when you elect your new pastor you say we want that little curly hair you know and little hollywood perfumed up sort of something get up on the pulpit and say amen real nice you know and we'll permit you to look at television all night wednesday night too let you out early oh that i hope that doesn't have around here don't usually ever let you out early but did not the world has not the world gone this way remember this was in 1959 los angeles california that was before denominational churches shut down for super bowl sunday or or they have super bowl parties at church i i sometimes see these announcements on facebook in different places for sermon series now i love sermon series i love getting on something staying on it a while i love that but i think there ought to be something more than than than six weeks with andy griffith i saw it recently recently i saw it six weeks with andy griffith well i had to look that up to see what it was and it's clips that they play to introduce the message for that night by teaching the wholesome principles of sheriff andy griffith they didn't have such thoughts as that in 59 when brother van was talking about churches calling themselves off letting out early so the people could go home and watch the television but they do it now let you out early so we can get some of the television programs you ought not to see won't say nothing when you're reading old true story magazines and filth come on you grisham fans and some of you folks stephen king fans in the holy ghost field church don't say nothing when you read no true story magazine and filth out on the street go into your office and pin-ups hanging around well he's a good fellow anyhow because he pays good god wants you to separate that's what's the matter with the church go into the church and have a little flowery sermon about some politician that's up to run and i hope you all vote for him and afraid if he says anything the deacons will throw him out how many of you know you can't have a pastor if he's afraid of the deacons throwing him out i tried that 17 years old answered to a deacon board at an assembly of god church and i got called on the carpet every time i turned around i had oh dear brother luke who's gone on to be with the lord come and preach and he had license with the congregational holiness and not with the assembly of god so the deacons called me in the office on that the same they forgot they forgot that when i came to take the church it was falling apart the pastor was suing them in court and the denomination wouldn't even stand by them they forgot and now they want to talk about me bringing in a pastor season more experience than i am because he didn't carry license with the denomination and then they wanted to call me in again how long is long how short is short i said are you serious you brethren are my elders have you really called me in here to help you define how long is long and how short is short a preacher can't obey god if he's afraid of the deacon board [Music] because i believe in pr let me tell you something the only real deacon that we ever had for any amount of time was brother benny west and he might have he might have corrected me from time to time when he felt like i needed it but i want you to know i never preached it too hard for him and if he thought it had been too long since i had preached it hard he would remind me he said i love all these new folks coming in here being a part and getting to hear the message and the truth i love it but he said don't forget every now and again i didn't resent that because i believe in preaching the gospel and listen how he ends this he said just throw the axe to the root of the tree god wants separators the church wants two more from that time paragraph 58 i know i got to hurry cause you're tired and i've got something i have to do at the end of this abraham was changed and look when a man meets god god called abraham and he told him he wanted him to separate himself from all of his unbelieving kindred and when god calls a man to work for him he calls you from total annihilation from all the things of the world and the sins of the earth separation god never did bless abraham until he fully obeyed him he took his father the old man was always a hair in his soup excuse that expression but he was always wrong he was he was an automaker and abraham and when he got lot then he finally went down there and after lot separated himself then god said to abraham rise and walk through the land i've give it all to you it's all yours see he never fully blessed him till abraham fully obeyed you're never going to have the blessing of the lord until we fully obey him this is all of us this is god talking to all of us there's nobody in this room that couldn't use a little more separating from unbelief don't you be a fanatic you just be sincere before the lord and let god lead you he'll lead you and you'll never be able and get your mouth over somebody else's mess you don't worry about what somebody else is doing you worry about you and your house you get your eyes off of somebody else let god deal with them amen a preacher will get them like he gets you and you'll never be able to get anything from god and have favor with god my brothers and sisters wherever you are until we fully obey the word of god you make yourself miserable by just half-heartedly approaching it how many of you have ever been in that place in your life were you are so miserable you can hardly stand it because you're just halfway doing it just halfway doing anybody getting this today the last one jehovah jiren number one back to that back to jehovah jair number one lewisville he said so we find those things go on and they finally come to the blossom here in the last days as jamers and janice withstood moses so will it be the same thing now total separation from all unbelief and remember abraham the patriarch was never absolutely fully blessed until he obeyed exactly what god said do and we'll never never never be blessed any and have the blessings until we obey what god said do is anybody with me now we need this we need it now i want you to to listen up you're going to wonder where in the world this is coming from this says catriel for anybody who wants to know that says catriel that's my hebrew name i had a dream last night and in my dream i revisited an experience that i had had with the lord in jerusalem and brother austin hodges come to say hello this morning i was so focused i could i greeted him and i finally even got up and hugged him and i said to him i'm having a brain freeze i can't find it i've been working with these things but i can't find it i just couldn't get the right title to to search it and to get it pulled up on the computer you have so many files and they've got so many names and so many dates and in the dream i was standing here just like this and i was reading an experience that i had in jerusalem i want to ask the musicians to come now and uh we're just shifting because this is you're going to wonder when i'm done how it connects but it only connects because the lord led it he connected it a few tuesday nights ago i came here and i told you that the the the word of the lord was guard your heart against any and all offense i heard brother greeley come and remind us of that word so many of the young people in their communication on their on the app that they use to communicate over the past few weeks many of them have signed on or signed off by saying i am unoffendable it's not a boast it's a cry of faith it says i gotta get there and he give me the scripture psalm 119 165 great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them that word offend means put a stumbling block in their path or make them to stumble and he said tell them to stay close to one another don't let anything or anyone come between you and the rest of the body stay close to one another don't let anything or anyone come between you and the rest of the body now that is important i don't know where you stand but i want to share this going to be a little bit raw for some because it's going to remind you of some difficult times but the truth is the grace of god the grace of god has brought us through we've come through we're still coming through but we've come through this is uh from a time my family had spent five and a half weeks in israel you feel like a citizen when you stay there that long i carried grocery store cards you you feel connected they know you when you go in the store they know you they call you by name they'll see you on the street they they laugh the locals of jerusalem laugh and they say it's a it's the biggest small town you'll ever live in i tell this sometime i was in a lonely little bit of a lonely place we were there the family was there my wife was expecting either olivia or mariah and we had barely landed and we had to get off because we were invited to a reception at the mayor the mayor was doing a reception at the tower of david the citadel just inside the jaffa gate of the old city and we had been invited specially invited to be there and it was some scene and that old dusty wind had blown in that red wind had blown in from the desert it come all the way from the subcontinent of africa all the way up to where we were and and uh unusual early rain came and when that early rain dropped down through that red mud i was dressed in white and black as the orthodox do and that red mud it put the biggest old mud splotches all over my shirt i said here i'm going to see the mayor like that i was just in a tither my wife was with sister nancy in the van and they were trying to find a place to park and we didn't know what in the world we would do because my wife was expecting and she was going to have to hike to get up there just a lot of things and i don't know but i'm standing in the in the main gate of the old city and i just feel lonely all of a sudden why am i here what am i doing here there's many places i should be why am i here and all of a sudden an orthodox jewish friend who runs the shoreshim gift shop near the herva synagogue in the old city the jewish quarter of jerusalem he saw me originally from toronto but had lived in israel for many many years two brothers moshe and dolph and i don't even remember which one of them it was now called out to me way across the street i'm just standing there just so lonely i'm trying to figure out which way will my wife and the family come from and just i just can't tell you the emotions that were going on why am i here and who cares about meeting the mayor you know all these things and i'm a muddy mess and he called to my to my name called my name across the street he said oh pastor shelley welcome home i just sobbed i just broke down and sobbed lord that's why i'm here i'm here because it's home jerusalem has that feeling we were getting ready to leave it was we were only supposed to be there for a few weeks we had extended our stay twice i think that was a time that my mother's birthday was coming up thanksgiving coming up and my mother loved thanksgiving and she was so disappointed when we thought that we wouldn't come home for thanksgiving that we sent her a ticket and told her to join us and she joined us in jerusalem for thanksgiving i think that was no no that wasn't the same time thanks honey for helping me that was not not the same time but anyway we had been there it was hanukkah time and uh five and a half weeks had passed i get a phone call just rocks my world without going into the detail of that call i'm informed of something that i had no idea did not know did not understand what was going on and the message was basically you're going to lose the apartment i hear we have just enjoyed it for five and a half weeks you're gonna lose it something has to be done and i said to the owner let me get home and sort out this situation but i hung up the phone and i was gutted panicked i had never felt more connected to jerusalem than i was feeling in that moment and now to think that we might not even have a place to go just it was emotional i was perplexed didn't understand shaken my faith shaken and we went to bed that night i think we were leaving the next day or the day after very shortly we were leaving to come home december of 2011 i've only been once since then i'm reading this now in the pulpit the last the the new year's meeting of 2011. i'm reading now the last night that we were in jerusalem i walk in the night to a light that was moving gently around the bedroom now there's something about my bedroom i don't know if benny's still watching but if you are there's something special about that bedroom had many many experiences there my first thought as that light just began to move around the room my wife laying there my first thought is that it was a flashlight beam however rather suddenly i was made aware of his presence filling the room for some reason i could not hold back the tears i just started crying the light that i was watching move around the room the light eventually settled on my side of the bed and then lengthened into a man any of you how many of you've ever seen that bedroom you've been inside it you've seen it quite a few of you at home i sleep on the other side of the bed but in jerusalem i sleep on the window side of the bed and that light came around there and lengthened into the form of a man standing on my side of the bed between me and the window i can look out that window on a clear day and see the judean wilderness in fact once i've seen a portion of the dead sea he was standing there so close to me i was able to make out features and this was something that had not happened to me before any time the angel of the lord or the lord himself had appeared in a experience a dream or vision or experience he had always been under such a fog a mist that i could never really make out features but i saw this time facial features and it shocked me shook me he was standing so close to me i was able to make out his features and this was so odd to me and oddly enough he was wearing my tallit now that's why i have this own i have more than one but this is one that if you'll just play anything softly this is one that i had just had made i don't know why at the time i didn't know why but we are wandering as a family in the old city and we come to a new place i've never seen it open before and there was a little orthodox jewish young man in there who was weaving on an old loom and i stepped in the door and i said hello there what are you doing and he said i'm weaving hand woven tallits and i said well i'd sure like to look at some and in that moment i knew i wanted it i wanted one now that was something i fought often in jerusalem there were lots of things i wanted we were spent out after all that time on mostly our own finances we were spent out and i said do you take cards because i would like to have one he said oh yes you'd look around and you'd think that they wouldn't have no set up for that but they do he said you pick out the colors and what you want and i will weave it i'll make it you can come back and watch me do some of it and he said i'll even put the bag and he said you give me your hebrew name and i'll put it on the on the bag so it was very special to me now i just picked it up and i had it laying in the cabinet closed the cabinet of the bedroom and here stands with my talit on it it just really shook me here's the lord standing with my prayer shawl on the one i just purchased in the old city he looked deeply into my eyes and asked me a heart-wrenching question here's what he asked he said do you trust me do you trust me what a question i couldn't imagine being asked such a question i said my lord you know that i trust you with all my heart and he smiled at me and he said can you trust me with all the details of your life and ministry you see only the lord knew what was ahead will you can you trust me with all the details of your life and ministry i could tell by the way he asked the question that he saw something in me that did not trust him fully even though i said to him i trust you with my full heart his look convicted me i felt like i had lied to the lord so i answered again without being asked again and i said i will do my very best to trust you in all things and i emphasize the word all because i knew there must be something in my life or ministry that i had either not trusted him with or would not trust him with when i should face it and the tears were streaming again and i remember weeping the lump growing in my throat my physical reaction was to melt and i slowly got out these words lord i am so concerned i'm so worried that you will not be able to completely trust me it's easier to trust the lord that when you look at yourself and you realize in his face there's something in you that you're not trusting him with must have been something small some problem some situation that i had not trusted or would not find easy to trust the lord and i said lord i'm the problem i am the problem and surely it will be easier for me to trust you than for you to trust me i'm so concerned and he smiled again gently and said oh but i do trust you there's nothing sweeter there's nothing more amazing oh but i do trust you and i've come to tell you that it's time to gather and guard gather and guard it's really where we've been for many years now gather guard sometimes we get a little slack gathering sometimes we may have got a little slack guarding but the commission of this house is to gather and guard that's what jesus said i know there'll be some who see this who i can't believe you'd get up and i can't i can't help it it just is the truth it's my truth it's what happened to me it's time to gather and guard he said just fully depend on me [Music] he said and i will lead your every step walk in repentance and humility and i will vindicate the truth that you have preached that's a pretty powerful word and i was later told then in this conversation that we could not go forward until we as leaders could lead the body into a place of repentance and when we returned home from jerusalem that was the message that was shared it was at a new year's meeting and paul keith was here and he referred to this i had already shared it with the body but he referred to it again because he had a chapter in his book called gather in guard and you know the funny fella he was he didn't have the best sense of humor but when he did it was pretty funny and he said i just got the best endorsement for my book i've ever got he said because the lord jesus spoke to brother shelly and gave him the name of a chapter of my book gather and guard it's a message that is so appropriate for the hour we're living in right now god's word calls for a total separation of unbelief and that is required for total deliverance and here we are as a body doing our best to trust the lord more concerned about whether or not he can trust us knowing that he can because he put himself in us he's seen the end from the beginning if he has confidence in us we can make it all the way how many of you believe that you may not trust yourself but i want you to know the one who knows you the most loves you the most has put his confidence in you he's put his trust in you that if you hold on to him you'll make it all the way [Music] that means committing everything into his hands he went on to speak to us about the spirit of truth the spirit of truth cannot testify of himself he can only speak what he hears spoken and he referred us to the spirit of prophecy and revelation where it talks about the testimony of jesus christ being the spirit of prophecy i want you to know we serve a supernatural god we're on a supernatural journey the bride is a supernatural people we can make this separation we can make this separation we can deal with unbelief and on that daily basis when we feel things creeping up to taint us to worry us beyond a normal parameter and start weighing on our mind we can pull that thing down we can say lord i believe help thou my unbelief it doesn't mean that there won't be a thought it doesn't mean that there won't be a pull what it means is you will be able to overcome because your trust is in the lord and he has put his trust in you let's stand now why the lord wanted it done that way and i thought i don't know if i'll have the courage to read that this morning i found it after austin left me there i i i was putting in all kinds of things none of them the right word i was standing here in worship and and i caught a glimpse of my dream again [Music] and i saw myself standing here with this on and i slipped over to my reading it and i stepped over to my wife and i said can you put your hands on that and she knew where it was and joshua ran right after worship to get it i don't know why i don't know why but i know this i know there are certain times in situations where things can't happen the way they're supposed to happen until everybody gets in the right place you come sit here no you sit there i just want to i if i never know the reason why i want to know that i've got enough trust to believe what he said and to do it how many of you feel that way oh i wouldn't take nothing i mean that's a good thing in the south when you say i wouldn't take nothing for that's good you say that anywhere else it sounds like it's not worth much but when we say that in the south it means it's more valuable than anything i wouldn't exchange it for anything in the world the peace that i feel right now because i know he's here that was somebody outstanding worship that you were doing leading us today benjamin lead us again let's worship him thank you for the lord [Music] you came and gave amazing grace thank you for this love yes [Music] yes thank you [Music] wash me in your cleansing flow now all i know your forgiveness [Music] is [Music] [Music] victory [Music] oh jesus god yes yes the treasure of heaven crucified worthy is the lamb worthy is the land [Music] [Music] can you sing it with him thank you for the prize [Music] yes [Music] no one's ever loved [Music] us wash me in your cleansing flow now all i know is [Music] you are seated on the throne [Music] [Music] victoria [Music] glorify your name lord yes the treasure of heaven [Music] worthy is [Music] i want you to see your perfect sacrifice [Music] it fixes your position in christ when you know your sacrifices lord jesus son of god oh the treasure of heaven crucified worthy is the lamb over [Music] yes just play that a minute when sister annie came to talk to me earlier today she was talking to me about coming in contact with students that she was involved with in health care now she's working in the schools and some of these students recognizing her and the thought that was in her mind at that moment was this therapy that they do skin to skin how many of you know what i'm talking about they take that baby and lay it up on the bare skin of his mother's chest and even now more than than than long time ago even now more than then they tell the daddy take your shirt off and hold that baby up to your skin we did it with ours even i did it with with ours there's something that takes place in that little baby it's a connection that's powerful powerful and i took that as a confirmation of what the lord had dealt with me about that morning about little children picking up things and how easy it is for something to be on them like that and then we have to spiritually draw them like the natural mother like the natural dad does it in the natural take that baby up and pull them up spiritually up under us and nourish them and connect with them again brush them off brush them off brush the world off brush brush these old bad things that get on them brush them off and say oh no oh no this one is mine there's healing and nourishment that come pray over them don't just pray on your bed for them in their bed pray over them lay your hands on them and say clean them lord separate them from any spirit that would touch their body trouble their mind change their behavior cause them to struggle socially parent desires for their children to be able to interact with other children it's so vitally important in life that your children are able to have interaction with other good godly children because they're growing up and we don't want to stunt them we want to promote them and bless them and help them and these are some of the ways that we can do it by praying over them i'm telling you i watched my children at times catch spirits off of airplanes when we traveled i've seen it in hotel rooms where they would catch a spirit and it would trouble them it would change them a little bit and sometime it would go on weeks before we realized the root of what was going on and what had happened what had taken place and children are more sensitive even little babies more sensitive to things so i i just felt like now she you want to talk to her after you can and and she might have another take but it's so it can really encourage my heart i think spiritually this is the hour to pull them up again to guard and protect to gather and guard and it may not make you a popular mama or a popular daddy but i tell you this is not a popularity contest this is for their soul this is for their soul and we hear things like children just don't understand you know why they don't because sometimes we don't sometimes we don't understand either sometimes we can't tell them because we don't understand it either but i tell you what we do know we know that we have committed it into the hands of somebody that we can trust he's going to take care of this i feel his presence just now lord we just pray put your hand on your children around your little church children around you just lay your hand on them right now lord we just ask say go out into the world and they're in school and some of them even in in little private school situations and whatever and we know lord that the enemy would surely like to put something on them and even afflict their bodies change their behavior a little bit it might be a little cartoon they're watching might be a little toy they're playing with it might be some interaction that mom and daddy are having with one another or with someone else but we just thank you for the redeeming power of the blood of jesus christ i mean put your hand on your grown children if you want to hey lord you've given us these babies we're watching them grow up we want them guarded and protected as much as we possibly can we don't want them growing up paranoid or afraid of life but we want them to know that there's a covering there's a covering for them there's protection for them by the precious blood of jesus christ now i want you to pray for yourself we're going to worship a little bit more and i want you to ask the lord for his grace to help you get to that place of total separation from unbelief where you are willing to pull yourself into his presence often more often than before pulling yourself out of situations that cause your heart to doubt that cause your mind to doubt you're pulling into him let's pull into christ and let's pursue a total deliverance how many of you will help me pursue i said to brother greeley in my office i don't have a total deliverance but i know it's mine i know it's mine i know the promise is there and i'm not asking god to look over my weakness i'm not asking god to look over my stuff i'm asking him to deliver me to deliver me from the root of it and i ask you i encourage you right now let's just pray for ourselves hallelujah lord here we are you gave us a word and we're going to have to process it and see what to do with it all but more than anything else we want that deliverance that's promised and we realize that there's only so much we can do to align ourselves to get ready to receive the help and one of those things is to cut off the sources of unbelief in our life buddha don't miss your time pray right now don't miss your chance pray right now lord show me show me show me show me what i can show me lord [Music] let me see let me see let me see my foot that's keeping the door propped open that god wants to close let me see my foot in the door oh god show me ways that i'm keeping something open that needs to be closed show me the ways there are desperate situations represented in this house and your word has come to set us free but we have preparation and lord that's that's our responsibility separate us from all unbelief may we see it and when we recognize it pull away from it and stand on the word may we stand on the word may we make decisions based on the word [Music] not based on emotion but based on the word we thank you for the grace right now we thank you for the grace right now to make that stand speak to us thank you for the cross lord tell him you appreciate him thank you for the price all my sin and change in love you came and gave amazing grace [Music] why don't you pray for one [Music] another why don't you just reach out and touch somebody on the shoulders
