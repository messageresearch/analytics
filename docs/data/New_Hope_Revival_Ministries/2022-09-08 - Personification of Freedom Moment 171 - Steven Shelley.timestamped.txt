[0:00] we're not looking for revival somewhere
[0:03] we are
[0:04] revival
[0:09] [Music]
[0:12] we understand that no man has ever
[0:15] sought god at any time by his own mind
[0:19] if a man or woman has ever sought god
[0:23] it's because god was seeking after that
[0:26] man or woman he found you right where
[0:30] you were how many of you are glad you
[0:32] didn't have to come up to where he was
[0:35] he reached way below the bottom and met
[0:39] you in your sin
[0:41] found you right where you were some of
[0:43] you he found you in some mighty rough
[0:46] places
[0:47] but he found you nonetheless
[0:49] and he didn't just leave you he stayed
[0:52] with you and hovered around you and
[0:54] called your name and pulled on your
[0:57] heart whispered in your ear
[1:00] protected you from death
[1:02] the very reason some of you are here
[1:04] today is because god kept you from death
[1:08] that he might have time to redeem you
[1:12] and present you
[1:13] as that chaste virgin that the word is
[1:16] making us in this hour
[1:18] we're being purified by the word
[1:21] the very stain of sin is being erased
[1:25] and what the curse has brought into our
[1:28] lives we are now seeing it reversed by
[1:31] the living word
[1:33] the earth around us is living under the
[1:36] weight and the load of the curse but the
[1:38] bride of jesus christ is coming out from
[1:42] under that curse
[1:44] and the world is getting worldlier and
[1:46] sicker and in more trouble but the bride
[1:49] is becoming more like her bridegroom
[1:52] every day that we live there's only one
[1:55] thing that'll make you more like christ
[1:58] and that's the word
[2:00] we're not just faced with a dead letter
[2:04] but we have a living word
[2:07] and this living word is more than a
[2:09] sermon he is a person
[2:12] and his name is the lord jesus christ
[2:15] he has broken every chain
[2:18] and every fetter he has power to set
[2:21] every captive free he has blown the
[2:25] silver trumpet of the jubilee so that
[2:28] every slave who can hear the voice of
[2:32] the trumpet
[2:33] calling us to come higher
[2:35] telling us church is not the answer
[2:38] telling us religion is not the answer
[2:41] there's only one answer and that's a
[2:43] relationship
[2:45] with jesus christ not twice a week
[2:50] every single day of the week
[2:54] every single day of the month
[2:56] a close relationship with him i think it
[2:59] sometimes baffles minds to find out that
[3:03] you can have that kind of a walk with
[3:06] him where he walks with you and talks
[3:08] with you and deals with you every single
[3:11] day of your life but he does
[3:15] we're not looking for revival somewhere
[3:18] we are
[3:19] revival
[3:20] that's what the word says we are revival
[3:24] we are the personification of a people
[3:27] who were once enslaved
[3:30] but by the beautiful grace and mercy of
[3:33] god we have now been set free and we are
[3:37] saying amen may i be the personification
[3:41] of freedom
[3:43] may i be the demonstration of liberty
[3:47] and may i never waste
[3:50] may i never squander freedom
