TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] foreign when there's no place to go you think no one knows what you're going through when you've done all you can you're exhausted my friend there's nothing else left you can do when life overwhelms you someone betrays you you're feeling like nobody cares there's still one place i know when there's no place to go i can go to the master in prayer i can go to the master [Applause] he always listens he welcomes my please cause he cares about me he won't overlook my petition he's standing above watching in love waiting my burdens to bear oh he's got time for you and a place for me too i can vote to the master in prayer when the world turns on me i'm so blind i can't see doubts are everywhere when my friends turned me down and my spirit gets bound i can't rise above all my fears when pain won't release me there's no peace within me i'm feeling like life it's unfair when my night's sleep is lost i've turned and i've tossed i can go to the master in prayer i can go to the master he always listens he welcomes my police cause he cares about me he won't overlook my petition he's standing above watching in love waiting my burdens to bear oh he's got time for you and a place for me too i can go to the master in prayer if your life's a bit in i can still recommend you can go to the master in prayer
