[0:22] Jesus Christ it's your faith that has
[0:25] been tried by the fire would be worthy
[0:27] of the well done he chooses to see what
[0:33] he saw about me
[0:35] that's mercy my love his grace take your

[1:15] [Music]
[1:19] would you go back to Psalm 139 verses 16
[1:26] through 18 nine eyes did see my
[1:29] substance yet being unperfect and in thy
[1:34] book all my members were written which
[1:36] in continuance were fashioned when as
[1:41] yet there was none of them how precious
[1:45] also are thy thoughts unto me O God how
[1:49] great is the sum of them praise the Lord
[1:53] if I should count them they are more in
[1:57] number than the sand when I awake I am
[2:01] still with thee let me read it as you're
[2:05] just listening carefully in there in the
[2:07] complete Jewish Bible your eyes could
[2:10] see me as an embryo but in your book all
[2:14] my days were already written my days
[2:17] have been shaped before any of them
[2:20] existed God how I prized your thoughts
[2:23] how many of them there are if I count
[2:27] them there are more than grains of sand
[2:29] if I finish the count I am still with
[2:33] you
[2:34] or with thee thank you Lord for that
[2:36] father we thank you tonight for
[2:39] direction that comes to our hearts from
[2:42] your word it lives lord I thank you that
[2:47] your word lives I thank you that your
[2:51] spirit is ever nearer to quicken your
[2:54] word to make words on a page become
[2:58] alive in our lives one thing I know Lord
[3:02] is you can't teach or preach revelation
[3:06] and expect it to be received as such it
[3:10] requires that the Holy Ghost works on
[3:14] both ends Lord of this channel tonight I
[3:18] pray Lord that somebody would catch a
[3:23] depth of what you would say to us a
[3:26] concerning
[3:27] the books of heaven I pray Lord that it
[3:30] would make somebody's way easier and
[3:32] that they might get a hold of something
[3:35] that would give them peace and not
[3:37] turmoil for Lord we thank you that you
[3:40] have seen it all and you intend to stay
[3:44] with us every step of every mile until
[3:48] we have finished the course Lord that's
[3:51] why we know we can make it because you
[3:54] are with us every step of the way we
[3:57] give you this time together in your word
[3:59] now for your glory and we give you honor
[4:02] and praise b'shem adonai Yahshua
[4:05] HaMashiach in the name of the Lord Jesus
[4:08] Christ we pray amen the Saints said a
[4:11] man so you may be seated I just want to
[4:14] stay with my notes here for just a
[4:17] moment I want to read a few statements
[4:18] to you that we hopefully mentioned some
[4:22] of them on Sunday we believe that every
[4:25] child of God has a record written I like
[4:30] to say a book scroll about them but I'll
[4:33] just quickly say this and then I won't
[4:35] have to say it again it was already
[4:37] mentioned Sunday I don't know what it
[4:39] looks like exactly and I don't know if
[4:42] yours is yours alone or if we're in a
[4:47] book of families or in a I don't know
[4:49] exactly how it is but I know it's there
[4:51] because the Bible said so now I need to
[4:55] be honest with you and tell you that
[4:56] there are many different interpretations
[4:59] of these verses of Scripture and the
[5:02] reason why I choose to preach them and
[5:05] teach them and believe them as I have
[5:07] presented them to you and others have in
[5:10] this pulpit is because it lines up with
[5:13] the message that we have been given I
[5:15] believe with all my heart that this is
[5:18] really a foundational verse or two - to
[5:22] help us understand that not only has God
[5:25] had lots of thoughts about us
[5:27] he wrote him down they are recorded in
[5:30] heaven and he is I tell you he is
[5:32] committed he is fully committed to his
[5:35] word and if it was God's thoughts that
[5:38] he had about you and it was recorded
[5:40] then that is an expression of the
[5:43] thought that becomes his word so if he
[5:46] watches over his word he watches over
[5:48] all of his words do you believe that not
[5:52] just what we have in the written record
[5:54] like whether Carrie taught us and and
[5:56] and I tell you it is something that
[5:59] maybe we knew but but it never hit us
[6:01] like it did until he said it so clearly
[6:04] because we limit some time what the word
[6:07] is to the written record of the word but
[6:09] he's a living he's alive and that is
[6:15] just a portion and any of God's thoughts
[6:20] that that he has expressed well then
[6:23] that becomes a part of his word so it
[6:26] wouldn't be wrong to say that in the
[6:28] message of the hour we also have
[6:30] contained in those messages the words of
[6:34] God in that right now the words of men
[6:37] might also be there because brother
[6:40] Branham is greeting the people and
[6:42] addressing news stories and different
[6:44] things but we know that in those sermons
[6:46] there the Word of God is there it lines
[6:53] up amen and we're thankful for that so
[6:57] we believe every child of God has a
[6:59] written record in the heavenlies about
[7:03] their life God's thoughts about them and
[7:06] toward them we believe from this this
[7:09] scripture and other scriptures that God
[7:11] saw us in our earthly form before we
[7:15] ever existed so he not only had a
[7:18] thought about what we would be
[7:19] spiritually but he also saw that we
[7:22] would it be expressed at some point and
[7:24] he knew exactly what point that was in a
[7:27] physical body of flesh and we know that
[7:31] because this was the plan even for God
[7:34] to come down and walk among us we some
[7:36] denied Redemption it's the greatest
[7:38] story that's ever been told and it
[7:41] required that the thoughts of God become
[7:44] manifest in a body of flesh to flesh out
[7:48] what God had purposed in his heart and
[7:50] you and I are here for a very similar
[7:53] and we must begin to see that and even
[7:57] if we don't know every detail that's
[8:00] written about us I want you to know we
[8:02] who believe this endtime truth we have a
[8:05] lot better idea of what our life is
[8:07] supposed to be than most people out
[8:09] there my heart was moved as as Zachary
[8:13] began to pray tonight and talk about
[8:16] those that he knows he's like most of
[8:19] you
[8:19] he works out there he's rubbing
[8:22] shoulders with hopeless people and even
[8:25] before he said that as some of the
[8:28] prayer requests well I think it might
[8:29] have been his prayer request that
[8:31] brought this thought to my mind and I
[8:33] just said Lord
[8:34] it's not always easy with you
[8:37] I don't believe he got offended that's
[8:40] that's just where it is it's not always
[8:43] easy when we have him because the enemy
[8:46] is always there to try to you know break
[8:49] the fellowship but I cannot imagine
[8:52] I cannot imagine trying to make it
[8:55] without him I mean I know there's even
[8:58] medications and things that can help
[9:00] people get over some of their problems
[9:02] and and and and do deal with some of
[9:04] their blueness and and depressions and
[9:06] so forth like that but my what they have
[9:09] to deal with to get to get that all
[9:13] those side effects and all the different
[9:15] things that go with it and if I did I
[9:17] tell you if we didn't have the Lord we
[9:19] couldn't make it and it ought to give us
[9:21] that same burden that Zachary was
[9:23] praying with tonight Lord help help him
[9:26] and help us to be alive so I'm saying
[9:30] that God saw our days he saw it all I
[9:32] believe even before the foundation of
[9:35] the world was laid he saw our choices he
[9:38] saw our decisions he knew our abilities
[9:41] he knew our strengths our gifts and he
[9:45] even knew our weaknesses it's important
[9:48] to know that he knew everything there
[9:49] was to know about us
[9:51] and therefore our story our Destiny's
[9:55] story is designed based on everything
[9:58] God knew about us our strengths our
[10:02] weaknesses think about it and he knew
[10:05] what it would take to bring us to a
[10:07] place that we could get over those
[10:08] weaknesses and even God said I'm gonna
[10:11] let leave that there he could have taken
[10:13] it I know he could have before it ever
[10:15] began but I'm gonna leave it there
[10:17] because I'm gonna find a place to
[10:18] glorify my name I'm gonna find a place
[10:21] to glorify Who I am and what I can do
[10:24] and and this time not in not in the
[10:27] crops that someone plants or in the
[10:30] battles that a particular army wins but
[10:33] this time I'm going to display my glory
[10:36] and my power and my sovereignty in a
[10:38] people now that's pretty good because
[10:42] you're chosen to be a part of those
[10:43] people then we believe that those
[10:46] thoughts were then recorded in a
[10:48] heavenly record and
[10:50] we sometimes say God wrote it down I
[10:53] don't know who wrote it down but it was
[10:55] written and we say Paul wrote this and
[11:00] Moses wrote that and David wrote this
[11:02] and we know that it came to them by
[11:05] inspiration but all of them didn't
[11:07] always do the writing
[11:08] they had scribes and I know that there
[11:12] are heavenly hosts that stay very very
[11:15] busy because God hasn't stopped thinking
[11:19] think of this he's still thinking and so
[11:23] they're still recording I like that
[11:27] because that means that there are
[11:29] blessings and there are other things
[11:32] along the way to help us sometimes a
[11:35] little little wippen to get us out of
[11:37] the permissive will and back to the
[11:40] perfect will of God and even that's hand
[11:42] designed by loving God I'm thankful you
[11:46] know you could just take his hand off of
[11:48] us and say you just find the perfect
[11:50] wheel the best way you can but he finds
[11:53] ways to guide us and to point us I'm
[11:56] thankful for that so after these
[11:57] thoughts are in the mind of God than
[11:59] they've been recorded in a heavenly
[12:01] record the destiny and kingdom purpose
[12:04] for each of our lives was written long
[12:06] before we were ever born not just the
[12:10] number of our days don't think that it
[12:13] was just this one is going to live 70
[12:16] years and 211 days and 14 hours and so
[12:22] many minutes and so many seconds he
[12:25] didn't just see our days by number but
[12:28] he saw our days also with content
[12:31] he saw different things that we would do
[12:34] for the kingdom of God he saw things
[12:37] that we would do of our own will and a
[12:40] court and he designed a plan as we just
[12:43] said a moment ago to get us back over to
[12:45] his will you've got a whole list of
[12:47] things that God is going to receive out
[12:50] of your life before you get out of here
[12:53] you understand that
[12:54] remember the teaching on a word sent
[12:58] from God you are you are a word sent
[13:02] from God you were first a thought band
[13:04] you have been expressed and therefore
[13:06] your word and remember what God said
[13:08] about his word and remember also that he
[13:11] was wooing over the water where those
[13:14] fallen seed were the seed of the
[13:16] original creation I read again some of
[13:19] the things that brother Bantam said
[13:21] about that even this afternoon and the
[13:23] Holy Spirit is just guarding and wooing
[13:25] and brooding and making love over the
[13:28] seed of the original civilization he
[13:31] called it in one quote and that was
[13:34] because it was there by the spoken word
[13:36] of God therefore it was the seed of God
[13:39] a thought of God a word of God and if
[13:42] God was so careful by the holy spirit
[13:45] the gentle dove to woo and guard that
[13:48] part of his word that would be brought
[13:51] back into fulfillment into reality and
[13:53] to be I guess we could say fleshed out
[13:55] if God was that careful to guard that
[13:58] word how much more careful is he to
[14:02] guard us our life because he sees the
[14:06] list the list is ever before him of what
[14:08] he intends to accomplish in our life I
[14:12] don't believe we're going to be judged
[14:14] in heaven based on you accomplishing
[14:17] more than me or me accomplishing more
[14:20] than you I don't think that's what
[14:22] rewards are all about
[14:23] I think rewards are about finishing my
[14:27] book did you finish your scroll and
[14:33] we'll show you some things that the
[14:36] scriptures say later and the message
[14:38] that really indicate that that is what a
[14:41] lot of it is about remember brother
[14:44] Branham said we will not stand the bride
[14:46] at the white throne judgment because
[14:49] we're being judged now well we know that
[14:51] means with trials and troubles and
[14:54] furnaces and tribulations
[14:58] but what we also might consider is that
[15:02] we are being judged now and evaluated
[15:05] now by how much of our scroll let's say
[15:08] a scroll tonight how much of our scroll
[15:11] are we living out I want you to know as
[15:14] sincere as I know how to be tonight I'm
[15:17] concerned about mine that's why I'm here
[15:21] tonight that's why I'm talking about
[15:23] this again I don't know what to say and
[15:25] I don't think it's even necessary to to
[15:28] try to figure out what to say to let you
[15:32] think that I'm sincere but I'm very very
[15:35] very sincere I'm concerned about my
[15:38] scroll I'm concerned about my book I I
[15:41] don't even have time to look back to see
[15:45] all the things that I think have been
[15:47] ticked off the list I hope I get some
[15:50] more I like to reminisce I do and I hope
[15:53] that I can get some time one of these
[15:55] days again to go back and think about
[15:57] things that have been marked off my list
[15:59] but now I'm getting very concerned about
[16:02] what's ahead and what's laying there on
[16:05] my list in my book or my scroll that was
[16:09] God's purpose for my life that I have
[16:11] not yet fulfilled and and in order for
[16:15] me to finish the rest I've got to get
[16:16] back to if I'm not there now I've got to
[16:20] get back to the perfect will of God
[16:22] right in His perfect will because it's
[16:26] only in the perfect will of God that
[16:28] those thoughts are ticked off checked
[16:30] off do you understand that I know you do
[16:32] you must you have to all right so I
[16:35] believe we have an individual record I
[16:37] believe he saw our activities he saw
[16:40] what we would accomplish in life and I
[16:42] don't want to get ahead of myself why
[16:45] I'm not going to say it either not just
[16:47] I'll get to it I want to just get to it
[16:49] and not and not then what happens
[16:52] sometime is I I get way over there and
[16:56] then I have a hard time because I want
[16:58] to come back the next service in and
[17:00] catch up and I can't always do that and
[17:03] so one day you you can just read all of
[17:06] this for yourself if you've got the
[17:08] patience you can just read it
[17:10] but but we're in a battle we are in a
[17:12] battle and and the battle is to get low
[17:16] enough to get humble enough to get
[17:18] surrendered enough and submitted enough
[17:22] that he can accomplish everything that
[17:25] he thought about us everything that was
[17:28] written in his record about us and we
[17:31] should be more concerned about getting
[17:34] into that position to do what's in the
[17:36] book
[17:37] then we should trying to discover what's
[17:40] written I don't believe it has to be a
[17:43] secret
[17:43] in fact I'll show you later that there
[17:47] are some ways to begin to discover if
[17:50] you haven't already what God's purpose
[17:52] in your life is but I think sometimes we
[17:56] get so caught up in trying to figure out
[17:59] what part we play maybe what office we
[18:02] are in the five fold or what our
[18:05] direction is or what our gifts are we
[18:09] want to identify that in our own lives
[18:10] we want to identify that in each other's
[18:13] lives and sometimes we can get so caught
[18:16] up in the frustration of not really
[18:18] knowing that we forget there's there's
[18:21] preparation that only you and I can make
[18:24] I don't care how many trials he designs
[18:27] I don't care how many tests come our way
[18:29] at the thoughts of the Lord only you can
[18:31] decide how you're going to respond
[18:35] do you hear me so so you might have
[18:38] another lap around the mountain you may
[18:42] see Kadesh Barnea again and I believe
[18:46] that that is part of what we can we can
[18:50] make some we can make some changes in
[18:53] the duration of some of the things that
[18:55] we have to walk through and we can make
[18:57] some some variations in some of the of
[19:00] the connections that we have to make in
[19:02] life by just getting surrendered Lord we
[19:05] want to get as low before you as we
[19:08] possibly can as humble before you and so
[19:12] we are not looking back to see our
[19:14] trophies but we're just looking ahead
[19:16] saying Lord let me walk out one more
[19:18] page you know if you can't think about a
[19:21] whole book 600 pages or more about you
[19:24] why don't you just say Lord get me a
[19:27] page let me just see what today's
[19:30] supposed to be I know today that I was
[19:33] supposed to try to keep the victory and
[19:35] the joy through everything the enemy
[19:37] sent to try to make me blue or depressed
[19:40] or low or whatever and by His grace I
[19:42] did it because I was aware of it I felt
[19:45] it when I woke up this morning and got
[19:47] in the shower I could feel that
[19:49] heaviness
[19:49] I wasn't him outside yet I could feel
[19:52] that heaviness and I said wait a minute
[19:54] I can't have that today and I just made
[19:57] a conscious decision and yes I've talked
[19:59] to myself in fact today our jet caught
[20:02] me talking to myself he came back to get
[20:04] a coffee err to get a water or something
[20:05] and I said oh you caught me talking to
[20:08] myself I guess you never do that you're
[20:09] probably too young but he said he does
[20:11] it so I guess it's not an aged thing I
[20:14] just speak it out sometime alright so
[20:17] there's a battle going on to get
[20:19] whatever is in that book it's been
[20:21] written about us to manifest and to be
[20:23] fleshed out here on the earth and we
[20:26] have to be completely surrendered to be
[20:27] able to do that could you all put that
[20:30] quote up from dr. Moses from the message
[20:34] dr. Moses I think it was the first one
[20:36] that we had there on the list in the
[20:39] mind of God Christ was already crucified
[20:44] let me just give you a quick context
[20:48] brother branham is talking about the
[20:50] serpent on the pole in the wilderness
[20:52] all right your so you'll know he said in
[20:55] the mind of God Christ was already
[20:58] crucified for he was the lamb slain from
[21:02] the foundation of the world back in Eden
[21:06] Christ in God's thoughts which became
[21:11] his word
[21:14] listen Christ in God's thoughts which
[21:22] became his word had not yet materialized
[21:28] but he knew it was for he had promised
[21:33] it and he let the children of Israel
[21:36] draw interest before the deposit was
[21:42] made
[21:45] if you find a bank that will let you
[21:49] earn interest on money that you don't
[21:51] have in the bank let me know because
[21:54] that's an incredible deal isn't it
[21:56] brother branham said that would be a
[21:57] deal but that's what happened see that I
[22:00] thought that was so good
[22:02] here it was already in the mind of God
[22:04] so to god it was done and what he did
[22:08] was he sent a plan put this serpent
[22:10] brass serpent on a pole have everybody
[22:13] to look at that the disease the plague
[22:15] will stop and he did it based on the
[22:19] lamb he did it based on Calvary and
[22:22] Calvary had never happened and so he let
[22:25] them draw a part of Redemption plan
[22:28] before it had ever been purchased
[22:30] because in the mind of God the lamb was
[22:33] already slain in that good amen - so to
[22:38] show that it was him knowing what was
[22:41] going to be he made something here that
[22:45] represent it and that was the the
[22:48] serpent on the pole so through the
[22:51] serpent they could see what was going to
[22:54] happen and through that they received
[22:59] their healing do you like that that is
[23:06] powerful you don't learn that just in an
[23:10] average Sunday school that's powerful
[23:13] you see even Jesus had a destiny that
[23:17] was already from the mind of God because
[23:19] remember he said there he said Christ in
[23:23] God's thoughts because that's where
[23:26] Christ originated
[23:30] in the thoughts of God there's only one
[23:33] God the only one person in God correct
[23:38] and so there's no eternal Sun and so
[23:43] before this thing is over we will look
[23:45] again at the counsel of heaven because
[23:49] the church really likes to talk about
[23:51] the Council of heaven and they like to
[23:54] use Genesis to talk about the Council of
[23:57] heaven let us make man in our image so
[24:01] that we will know there are at least
[24:03] three people sitting around a conference
[24:04] table deciding how Redemption is going
[24:07] to come but how many of you know it
[24:09] wasn't near that difficult because there
[24:13] was only one thinking there was only one
[24:16] mind involved in this that was the mind
[24:19] of God we can say it that way God the
[24:22] mind of God but in the mind of God he
[24:25] had a plan for a son he had a plan for
[24:29] your Redemption and my Redemption he had
[24:32] a plan for how man was going to fall and
[24:35] a plan for how man was going to get to
[24:38] where he could trust
[24:41] a portion of the plan which was the
[24:43] older covenant until he could see the
[24:46] fulfillment and reality of the plan he
[24:48] took care of it and he spread it out
[24:50] think of this he spread it out across
[24:53] the years he could have done it all had
[24:55] it all happen within about a day or two
[24:58] there in the Garden of Eden cross and
[25:00] all but he had a bigger plan he was
[25:03] teaching the people to trust he was
[25:05] showing a people like you and I who are
[25:07] in the end time who get to look back
[25:09] over the whole plan and we can still say
[25:12] no matter what we read God is good no
[25:15] matter what you read in the Old
[25:16] Testament God is good and course people
[25:20] have the question why did he tell him to
[25:22] kill their enemies and why did this have
[25:24] to happen and why did that plague I'm
[25:25] telling you if you get all the way to
[25:28] the end and look back you will have to
[25:30] say god it's good he knew what he was
[25:33] doing all the time
[25:35] so even Jesus originated as the Christ
[25:38] in the mind of God and there was a
[25:42] record written of his life and there was
[25:47] a writ there was a record written about
[25:50] his plan of redemption and what he would
[25:54] do and remember that the Bible said that
[25:58] the world could not contain the books
[26:00] that could have been written had they
[26:03] been written in the earth I'm
[26:07] paraphrasing but this world wouldn't be
[26:10] big enough so I'm telling you four
[26:13] Gospels is full of what he did while he
[26:16] was here on earth but the earth would
[26:19] not contain the wholeness of what he was
[26:22] accomplishing you know why because every
[26:24] move he made he was accomplishing things
[26:27] not just in the natural but also in the
[26:30] spiritual because his surrendered
[26:33] movement his surrendered obedience
[26:36] choosing to go one way to get to a place
[26:40] instead of the other way everything he
[26:42] did breaking the bread why why here he
[26:47] is spitting on the mud and making these
[26:50] mud cakes and putting them in and and
[26:53] and
[26:53] getting them to be washed out other
[26:55] places he didn't heal the blind that way
[26:57] but he did it different ways and every
[27:00] time he moved according to the Father's
[27:02] plan
[27:03] there were multitudes of things being
[27:06] accomplished in both realms famines were
[27:10] being ended and disease was stopping and
[27:13] we don't know what all was happening but
[27:16] we know that because he lived a
[27:18] surrendered and laid down life to the
[27:19] will of the Father we know that every
[27:21] movement that he made was accomplishing
[27:23] great things but none of them a surprise
[27:26] through the Eternal Spirit of the Father
[27:29] God who thought it all and recorded it
[27:33] all so Jesus is more than the written
[27:36] word Christ is more than just the
[27:40] written record of the word he is the
[27:43] word in that right all right now let's
[27:45] look at this verse hebrews chapter 10
[27:48] verses 5 through 9 and yes we read this
[27:51] i'm watching the time but we're gonna
[27:55] read it again quickly verse 5 Hebrews 10
[27:58] 5 wherefore when he cometh into the
[28:00] world he saith sacrifice and offerings
[28:04] that what is not but a body hast thou
[28:06] prepared me interesting
[28:10] we know the sacrifice and offerings that
[28:12] he's talking about is the older covenant
[28:14] right it's the two rides the instruction
[28:17] of the law it the whole plan of
[28:20] sacrifices are you with me it's the
[28:22] whole plan of offerings every bit of it
[28:25] intricately meticulously designed with
[28:30] with God having an opinion about every
[28:33] detail you know that don't you every
[28:35] color and every material that was used
[28:38] in this whole process in the tabernacle
[28:41] and in the temple was chosen by God to
[28:44] represent something the number of
[28:46] sockets the number of poles in the
[28:52] tabernacle the dimensions of the of
[28:55] though of the curtains that that hung
[28:58] between the poles every bit of it the
[29:02] shape of the camp around the tabernacle
[29:04] God had an opinion about all of it
[29:07] so anybody who looks at the Old
[29:09] Testament and then comes to the New
[29:11] Testament day and say I don't think God
[29:13] cares about too much I want you to know
[29:15] he cares about everything that touches
[29:17] your life every detail he cares about it
[29:22] you believe that he might even care
[29:25] about what vehicle you drive I hope he
[29:28] does because when you're standing there
[29:30] not knowing what to do you sure would
[29:32] like a help from the Lord with you
[29:34] what's your wheel so yes he does all
[29:36] right so he when he cometh into the
[29:39] world sacrifice and offerings that wood
[29:41] is not but a body has thou prepared me
[29:43] and there was a plan for that and a
[29:45] reason for that there was a purpose in
[29:48] all of that in burnt offerings and
[29:51] sacrifices for sin thou has no pleasure
[29:54] even though at one time that was exactly
[29:57] what God was requiring but now we have a
[30:01] fleshing out of the word the word the
[30:06] thought of God the mind of God
[30:08] concerning Christ is now being fleshed
[30:11] out and it cannot be fleshed out in
[30:13] lambs and bulls and goats and washings
[30:15] and and fiery offerings it can only be
[30:18] fleshed out in a house in a body then
[30:21] said i lo I come in the volume of the
[30:25] book it is written of me everything in
[30:31] that Bible that written record of God's
[30:34] Word that we have every bit of that is
[30:36] written about Jesus how many of you
[30:38] believe that well I mean let me get you
[30:40] caught up for just a moment now
[30:42] please do if you can stay right with me
[30:46] everything in that written record but
[30:48] remember that's not all that God thought
[30:50] and so everything there there must be
[30:53] other books written in the heavenlies
[30:56] with details even about the life and
[30:59] Ministry of Christ that we don't know
[31:01] anything about just yet but he has come
[31:03] to fulfill everything in that written
[31:05] record and he has come to fulfill
[31:07] everything that's been written about him
[31:09] in the heavenlies did you see that you
[31:12] understand that that could very well be
[31:14] the case all right I excuse me in the
[31:18] volume of the book it is written of me
[31:19] to do thy will o God
[31:20] above when he said sacrifice and
[31:23] offering and burnt offerings and
[31:24] offering for sin that what is not
[31:26] neither hets pleasure there in which are
[31:28] offered by the law then said he lo I
[31:31] come to do thy will O God he taketh away
[31:34] the first that he may establish the
[31:36] second it was God's perfect plan for the
[31:40] word to be fleshed out in the body of
[31:43] our Lord Jesus Christ
[31:45] what condescension what a what a long
[31:48] long way he came stepping down from that
[31:54] glorious throne to live in a very humble
[31:57] body and think about we know what the
[31:59] Prophet taught us his birth was
[32:01] announced where two Shepherds
[32:06] hard-working farmers you know just
[32:10] common people
[32:13] modern politicians think those common
[32:16] people don't have as much gray matter as
[32:19] some of the rest of us but God must have
[32:23] felt something different he chose to
[32:25] announce his birth to shepherds he
[32:30] wasn't born in a sterile hospital room
[32:33] but but in a in a place where the venom
[32:36] said a manure pile just as humble as it
[32:40] gets
[32:40] those swaddling clothes were those
[32:43] stinking oily and sometimes bloody rags
[32:47] that were used to wipe down the cattle
[32:50] they weren't swaddling blankets warmed
[32:52] in a in an incubator little pink and
[32:56] blue stripes like you get from Medical
[32:59] Center these were used rags
[33:02] didn't make a difference he was coming
[33:05] and there was nothing that could touch
[33:06] him there wasn't a disease that could
[33:08] touch him no siree he was coming and a
[33:11] plan was going to be fulfilled do you
[33:13] believe that so I believe it too so
[33:15] there was a book in heaven that
[33:17] chronicled the kingdom purpose of the
[33:19] Lord Jesus and how it would be fulfilled
[33:21] in the earth can I have divine love
[33:23] please the one from the message divine
[33:25] love let's look at that last Sunday with
[33:29] you here
[33:30] I believe I preached on the assurance
[33:33] the power that God had promised and
[33:36] ordained you and called you before the
[33:41] foundation of the world notice this now
[33:42] ordained you and called you
[33:49] so he didn't just choose you or think a
[33:53] good thought about you but he ordained
[33:56] you do you know what the word ordained
[33:58] means to give authority to give position
[34:02] to to say for instance if a minister is
[34:05] going to have a a place in the at least
[34:08] in the church world in the hierarchy of
[34:11] the church world before he gets up and
[34:13] preaches and and can say I'm a minister
[34:15] and I have a public ministry and I can
[34:18] carry out the ordinances of the church
[34:20] there's a process he goes through but
[34:22] once he receives that ordination it
[34:24] means he has the backing of the church
[34:26] he has the backing of the body now the
[34:28] scripture saying I mean excuse me the
[34:30] quote the message is saying here that
[34:33] before I believe I preached on the
[34:36] assurance the power that God had
[34:39] promised and ordained you and called you
[34:41] before the foundation of the world
[34:44] so not just thought about or chosen but
[34:47] ordained meaning God said that one is
[34:50] mine I'm gonna get my glory from him I'm
[34:54] gonna get my will accomplished through
[34:56] that one there was an ordination and
[34:59] then he said he ordained you and called
[35:01] you before the foundation of the world
[35:03] and put your name in his book you
[35:08] believe that you believe your name is in
[35:10] his book do you believe it I believe it
[35:15] I believe my name is in his book I
[35:17] believe you ordain me and called me
[35:19] before the foundation of the world here
[35:22] is where some people really have a
[35:23] struggle but to me it just causes me to
[35:26] rest you had nothing to do with it
[35:32] and truly you didn't and here's what
[35:35] he's saying he's not saying you didn't
[35:37] have a choice he's not saying that at
[35:39] all
[35:40] he's saying you had nothing to do with
[35:42] God choosing you you had nothing to do
[35:45] with God giving you the power and
[35:46] ordaining you and calling you before the
[35:49] foundation of the world you weren't
[35:50] around
[35:50] you were only a thought in his mind so
[35:54] you couldn't qualify yourself and you
[35:56] couldn't disqualify yourself he's not
[35:59] saying there's not a plan for repentance
[36:00] he's not saying that you don't have a
[36:02] choice of freewill let me tell you
[36:04] something that freewill that God has
[36:08] given us to make our own decisions and
[36:10] choices it means more than just our
[36:12] choice to serve Him we have a free will
[36:15] and that means sometimes I've heard some
[36:19] of these young men let me say this I've
[36:21] heard some of these young men and
[36:22] they're praying different ones and I've
[36:24] also said this many times in private
[36:27] prayer I don't know what public prayer
[36:28] but but then there's a song also that we
[36:32] sing that says I give you permission
[36:37] Lord we give you permission to come and
[36:40] have your way with us tonight how do you
[36:42] feel about that
[36:43] I feel good about it
[36:47] because your free will it's not just the
[36:49] one that said yes I'm gonna serve the
[36:51] Lord one day your free will means God
[36:54] has placed that there and he honors that
[36:58] that's why prayer is so important prayer
[37:02] is not you telling god what the need is
[37:05] help me a little bit he already knows
[37:08] the need so you're not praying to inform
[37:10] God he knows more about it and you do I
[37:13] wonder if he ever chuckles when we lay
[37:16] out the case and God said that's just
[37:17] what you think that's what you think's
[37:19] going on but that's not really what's
[37:21] going on he knows more about the need
[37:24] than we know but because he's given you
[37:27] free will he honors that it's gonna be
[37:29] important later not later deny but later
[37:32] on he honors that he's not going to step
[37:36] over your free will
[37:39] that's why I'm making the right decision
[37:40] all the time is the right thing stay
[37:43] with me come on look this way that's why
[37:46] it's so when we come into a service even
[37:48] every service even one we don't have a
[37:51] whole lot of hope for
[37:55] like a foggy Tuesday night he's not
[37:59] going to force his way on you he's not
[38:03] gonna push yourself on you he's waiting
[38:06] for you to yield yourself you don't and
[38:09] me I don't always have to say Lord I
[38:11] give you permission but I need to
[38:13] express to him Lord I I want to be
[38:16] yielded to you that's why some of these
[38:19] songs are more important than we realize
[38:21] because they become our surrender how we
[38:26] connect with them in faith how we
[38:28] believe what we're saying I'm just like
[38:31] some of you folks I don't particularly
[38:33] like that well you wouldn't believe it
[38:36] would you but I don't particularly like
[38:37] to hear the same thing over and over I
[38:39] don't particularly like to save the same
[38:41] thing I'm even worse about that if I
[38:43] tell you I want you to get it you know
[38:47] what I mean I don't mean in preaching I
[38:48] just mean that even in regular life but
[38:50] also in preaching you don't want to keep
[38:52] saying the same thing over here
[38:54] you tell your your children something
[38:56] you don't have to tell them again over
[38:58] and over again I need you to do this
[38:59] this and this and then them come back
[39:01] before you're ever finished with a list
[39:02] and say what would you say I can see you
[39:06] don't have that problem what was what
[39:08] was what was it I needed to do you you
[39:11] want it to be and so it's important to
[39:14] understand sometime that when we're
[39:17] seeing so sometimes those songs can be
[39:19] very repetitive some some of them but
[39:22] like one that we sung tonight there's
[39:25] that little there's that little section
[39:27] of that song that repeats and the music
[39:30] builds just a little bit and any it does
[39:32] something I feel it sometime when I say
[39:39] it over and over again I know everybody
[39:42] don't feel the same way but sometimes
[39:44] you are saying it first and singing it
[39:48] first by faith you don't feel that I
[39:51] don't feel like I want to do but you
[39:53] keep doing it and you're pushing in and
[39:56] you're confessing and you're choosing
[39:59] and though you may not be saying Lord
[40:02] I'm giving you permission the more you
[40:04] press in that way the more permission
[40:07] it's
[40:08] opening up the gate it's opening up the
[40:10] door and why did it have to be that way
[40:12] because God gave you a free will it's a
[40:15] gift but it's also a responsibility so
[40:17] I'm all for it
[40:18] I'm all for praying Lord we give you
[40:22] permission so that God doesn't need our
[40:25] permission I want you to know there are
[40:26] certain places where he does because he
[40:30] has bound himself to your free will
[40:34] again prayer becomes so important not to
[40:38] inform God of what the need is but to
[40:40] agree I agree with the victory
[40:44] Zachary said I agree with the victory I
[40:50] come in agreement with the victory
[40:53] someone called me today to give me a
[40:56] testimony and I'm not going to
[41:01] particularly share it tonight
[41:03] maybe later have someone else to share
[41:06] it but it was some pain that had been
[41:11] lingering a long time and a new pain had
[41:14] jumped on people were noticing that
[41:17] there was pain there and little you know
[41:20] handicapped a little little what would
[41:23] you say kind of nursing the pain having
[41:26] some different manifestations and then
[41:29] the enemy starts talking
[41:31] and he tells you you know this is not
[41:33] just a strain this is something else you
[41:36] get that in your head and this this
[41:39] brother said to me I just it got so
[41:42] heavy when that that morning I woke up
[41:44] and it got so heavy I could say I'm not
[41:46] even gonna say the word right now got so
[41:49] heavy and I just started confessing and
[41:52] speaking and he went on to give his
[41:55] testimony of how that God moved for him
[41:58] in that direction and that the pain was
[42:01] gone
[42:02] not just the piggy back pain but the
[42:05] original source of the pain was gone and
[42:08] I said I'm gonna pray that God will help
[42:11] you to remember your confession and if
[42:13] the enemy tries to put even a touch of
[42:15] that symptom on you again that you'll
[42:17] jump right up and make the same
[42:19] confession and defeat the devil the same
[42:22] way you're defeating him now how
[42:24] powerful it is what we have what's been
[42:28] given to us all right divine love did we
[42:31] get through that one no
[42:34] you had nothing to do with it God did it
[42:38] isn't that wonderful the lamb was slain
[42:40] before the foundation of the world and
[42:43] why this is good it never happened till
[42:47] four thousand years later four thousand
[42:53] years later before the lamb was slain in
[42:56] time he was slain in eternity but not in
[43:02] time for four thousand years but listen
[43:06] to this
[43:06] but God when he spoke it I want you to
[43:10] be looking up there that's why I've
[43:12] decided to put it up there it's hard to
[43:15] follow sometime but this is a good way
[43:16] to see it
[43:18] but God when he spoke it he had to do it
[43:22] cause he has to keep his word his
[43:29] thoughts consistent his words were
[43:33] consistent what he designed for the
[43:36] Ministry of Christ was consistent and
[43:38] also for you he's not changing his mind
[43:42] about his word for you I don't care how
[43:46] bleak your circumstances have turned I
[43:48] don't care how hopeless they feel or or
[43:51] how many hiccups have come or things you
[43:53] did not see coming and you no longer see
[43:57] any way at all there are some things I
[44:00] also have in my mind that I could easily
[44:02] say I don't see any way in the world
[44:05] that could ever be like I thought it was
[44:07] to be but I have to remember if God
[44:11] thought it it is recorded and he is
[44:16] bound he bound himself you didn't bind
[44:19] him I'm not binding him he bound itself
[44:21] with covenant and commitment to his word
[44:24] and it is going to come to pass now in
[44:27] this case it was four thousand years
[44:29] later but you know you know you and I
[44:31] don't have four thousand years of life
[44:33] left so we know that there's some things
[44:36] that have to move for us now he said but
[44:40] God when he spoke it he had to do it
[44:42] because he has to keep his word and the
[44:44] same time that the lamb was wrote down
[44:46] watch now the same time that the lamb
[44:49] was wrote down
[44:50] you were wrote with him
[44:58] think of an
[45:02] you are already in him
[45:07] you are all
[45:09] in him when the record was made of God's
[45:15] plan for redemption you are already in
[45:21] the lamb you may see it you are already
[45:25] in the lamb why is that so important
[45:28] because you may be in a dozen different
[45:31] books I don't know how many individuals
[45:34] well maybe some folks are so busy one
[45:37] Scroll in heaven or one book in heaven
[45:39] couldn't hold all that they're going to
[45:42] see and accomplish and do in their life
[45:44] good bad and ugly or however it works
[45:46] but it could be you may be in more than
[45:50] one I don't know but I'm telling you one
[45:52] you are in you're in the book of the
[45:55] lamb the book of the lamb is the book of
[45:58] redemption it's not just the title deed
[46:02] to heaven and earth but it holds every
[46:05] mystery of the Bible brother Branham
[46:06] said that book was in the hand of God he
[46:12] placed that book in Adams hand is that
[46:14] right Adam forfeited that book that book
[46:18] was taken back that book is sealed was
[46:22] sealed with seven seals that book is the
[46:26] book of redemption brother Branham said
[46:27] it holds all the mysteries of the Bible
[46:29] it holds every name of every person that
[46:33] will ever be saved he said it and he
[46:38] goes on to tell us all the other things
[46:39] that are in it he said it's the Lamb's
[46:42] Book he said it's the book that reveals
[46:45] the Lambs work or the Lambs ministry and
[46:49] now he says tonight when the lamb was
[46:52] written there
[46:55] and the same time that the lamb was
[46:58] wrote down
[46:58] you were wrote with him our names were
[47:03] written in the Lamb's Book of Life not
[47:05] the night we come to Christ but before
[47:09] the foundation of the world the Bible
[47:11] said so that's the assurance and brother
[47:15] touched on that this morning in this
[47:17] marvelous Sunday school reading that's
[47:21] the assurance the assurances you were in
[47:25] the lamb from before the foundation of
[47:28] the world when God had the design in his
[47:31] mind and wrote it down and recorded it
[47:35] in these heavenly places you were
[47:38] written in the book with the lamb that's
[47:42] powerful maybe just for me and two or
[47:46] three more but that for me is very very
[47:48] powerful
[47:49] so then Jesus came to this earth in
[47:52] closing with a passion and a commitment
[47:55] to complete everything that had been
[47:59] written of him in that heavenly record
[48:03] the Lambs ministry was pre-planned
[48:09] predetermined by God I want you to think
[48:12] about it just a moment sister Flo said
[48:16] to me one time many years ago before I
[48:19] ever met some of you when she had an
[48:22] accident on her job and the tip of her
[48:26] finger are really more than the tip was
[48:28] taken from her and it really disturbed
[48:32] me terribly I just couldn't stand the
[48:38] fact that that was taken from her and it
[48:43] bothered me for a lot of reasons
[48:46] of course I was in my early 20s and the
[48:51] message was so fresh and so real and so
[48:54] powerful and I was focusing on her more
[48:59] s
[49:02] a lady
[49:05] and I I felt like that would bother her
[49:08] and I said old sister Flo I'm so sorry
[49:11] that it had to be that way
[49:14] in my mind I thought well she'll be sub
[49:17] she'll be self-conscious of it and I
[49:21] said I'm so sorry about it she said well
[49:23] brother Shelly it's alright she said
[49:26] I've got my hand I've got my arm I've
[49:28] got my life and she said furthermore she
[49:31] said maybe it has to be like this
[49:33] some somebody has to be there has to be
[49:36] some limbs missing to fulfill the
[49:39] promise that missing limbs are going to
[49:42] be restored and you may think that was
[49:45] just somebody's comment to come their
[49:49] pastor to him but really it was faith
[49:53] that's what she believes that's what I
[49:56] believe
[49:57] if every bit of the Lambs ministry was
[50:01] recorded before the lamb was ever
[50:03] manifested on planet earth then God had
[50:05] a lot of things in his design I don't
[50:08] have time to talk about him but you
[50:10] think about it with me just a moment
[50:11] that means that in his mind there was a
[50:15] Bartimaeus and he wrote it down in his
[50:20] mind there was a circus and he wrote it
[50:23] down there was a woman with an issue of
[50:26] blood and he wrote it down think about
[50:28] the miracles there were 10 lepers that
[50:31] were going to come and he wrote it down
[50:32] if the Lambs ministry was already
[50:35] outlined in the mind of God and recorded
[50:39] in those heavenly records then every bit
[50:42] of what we read in the New Testament was
[50:45] already a part of God's plan and design
[50:48] and it was up to God think about this it
[50:52] was up to God to get Zacchaeus ff3
[50:59] Zacchaeus wasn't born again
[51:02] Zacchaeus might have even had a problem
[51:05] with honesty but it was up to God to get
[51:08] Zacchaeus up that tree and as you've
[51:11] read in social media think of times it
[51:13] was up to God to get that tree there are
[51:17] you still with me I'm nearly done it was
[51:21] up to God to get that tree there it was
[51:23] up to God to get Zacchaeus of that tree
[51:25] why because in the mind of God
[51:27] concerning Christ there was a miracle
[51:29] that was going to take place there was a
[51:32] deliverance it was going to take place
[51:33] in Zacchaeus his life
[51:40] that means God had a little bit more to
[51:42] say in the design than what we realize
[51:51] want you to think about a woman it was
[51:54] going to have five husbands
[51:57] and the one she was living with at the
[51:59] time she met the master was not her own
[52:01] not her own husband and Jesus saw that
[52:04] and how that woman get to that place
[52:08] if you thinking about the Ministry of
[52:10] Jesus as though he was only responding
[52:14] to circumstances that presented
[52:16] themselves then you're not seeing the
[52:19] sovereignty of God and his plan and
[52:21] therefore you will see your life I hope
[52:25] you hear this you'll see your life that
[52:27] way and you'll see you as only
[52:30] responding to whatever circumstance
[52:32] comes up in your life but how many of
[52:34] you believe it could free some of us if
[52:36] we began to recognize God already made
[52:39] provision he already made provision for
[52:40] this when heaven meets earth when the
[52:45] plan and design that God has for us
[52:48] above when we bring that down the
[52:50] provision with it the healing with it
[52:52] the direction with it the right job with
[52:55] it the right spouse with it everything
[52:57] that God has remember our life is not
[53:01] reacting to something God didn't see
[53:03] coming we're reacting to things we might
[53:06] not have seen coming but God saw it if
[53:12] that is true about the Ministry of Jesus
[53:14] when his ministry was being wrote down
[53:16] you were wrote down with him
[53:18] that's what he said I believe it seems
[53:21] to fit the continuity of Scripture for
[53:23] me you're afraid for me to get excited I
[53:25] know
[53:28] it's it's not reactionary we make it
[53:31] that way you know what why because we're
[53:34] designed with those emotions that stand
[53:37] between our spirit and our soul and we
[53:39] react by emotion I said we whatever you
[53:42] want me to say we but we don't have to
[53:46] if I choose to act react that way I
[53:49] think I can choose not to react that way
[53:51] and I just have to say Lord this isn't
[53:53] mine
[53:55] put my hand on my knee and said Lord
[53:57] I've dealt with enough of my own
[53:59] infirmity I don't need nobody else's I'm
[54:05] not having this it's just the same way
[54:08] the brother testified on the phone today
[54:10] I'm not I cannot let my mind go to what
[54:14] this could be you know it's a sad thing
[54:19] in America because everybody diagnoses
[54:21] herself and and and I don't know what if
[54:25] that's always good because you can read
[54:28] terrible things awful things you can
[54:32] decide you've got two days to live and
[54:36] it may just be a stone it's gonna pass
[54:39] right listen our life is not reactionary
[54:44] we are not reacting to things that God
[54:46] didn't see coming Jesus his life was not
[54:49] that way
[54:50] he wasn't just responding to
[54:52] circumstances that that presented
[54:54] themselves he was living in sync
[55:00] how many of you know what it means to
[55:03] sink to sink your contacts
[55:07] every time I get in my vehicle it says
[55:11] sinking contacts
[55:13] that means I've added somebody or I've
[55:15] taken somebody out or I have added a
[55:18] birthday or I've put a phone number in
[55:20] and it's sinking them it means bringing
[55:24] all the information in different places
[55:26] into one place so that I can view it in
[55:30] different places Jesus was walking in
[55:33] divine synchronization with the plan
[55:38] that his father had already thought and
[55:40] it already written down you believe it
[55:43] and if I believe it I do and so are we
[55:51] that does not take responsibility off of
[55:54] us it puts more on
[55:59] because I get to choose by by the power
[56:01] of myself will how I react to what God
[56:05] already saw coming my way and how I
[56:08] choose to react is going to determine my
[56:10] victory
[56:13] Orma pain
[56:16] it's going to affect the duration of the
[56:18] trial and the benefit of the victory so
[56:22] I do have a responsibility even though
[56:24] my life is written for me I have a
[56:27] responsibility how many of you know you
[56:29] don't want any you don't want any
[56:31] disconnects you don't want any hiccups
[56:32] and when you're sinking stuff you don't
[56:34] want it one day to disappear out there
[56:36] you if God has a plan you want to be
[56:37] able to keep up with it every step of
[56:39] the way alright give me one more and
[56:41] we're doing now if it's paragraph 12 now
[56:45] if you want your example to lay aside
[56:48] your pattern to see what the scripture
[56:51] goes together with just lay Jesus over
[56:55] here and go to watching him and place it
[56:59] in the Bible you've got the whole thing
[57:01] come out right because it is the
[57:04] revelation of Jesus Christ the new
[57:07] testament and the old both all speak of
[57:12] Jesus would you agree Jesus Christ the
[57:15] Son of God cause he is the book of
[57:21] redemption
[57:25] he is the book of redemption
[57:29] he is the lamb
[57:32] he is the Lion of the tribe of juda
[57:37] isn'y he is the Tree of Life
[57:40] he is the book of redemption
[57:46] Jesus Christ the Son of God because he
[57:48] is the book of redemption
[57:50] he was the word and he is the word and
[57:52] that's bound to be him you see so this
[57:56] is the whole book think of this this is
[58:01] the whole book of redemption which is
[58:04] Jesus Christ fitly put together by God
[58:11] you believe there are any mistakes in
[58:13] building Jesus you believe the father
[58:16] built him just right in every aspect
[58:20] every portion of ministry fitly put
[58:25] together by God with the promises of
[58:28] redemption and healing and everything
[58:30] for the human being see he said do you
[58:33] get that now the book is Jesus Christ
[58:37] put together by God you're in that book
[58:42] and he come as a human being and
[58:45] redeemed us and every promise is in him
[58:49] and for you
[58:53] I'm reading every promise is in him and
[58:57] for you for he is the Redeemer the book
[59:04] of redemption is Jesus
[59:09] just think a moment
[59:13] you
[59:17] think this just a moment in closing
[59:22] is that the same book
[59:28] brother branham identifies the seven
[59:30] seal book as the book of redemption
[59:34] and now he says spiritually
[59:37] Jesus is that book
[59:40] remember what the scripture tells us
[59:43] concerning the book of the revelation
[59:44] there it is the apocalypsis it is the
[59:47] unveiling of Jesus Christ
[59:49] brother banner said the Tree of Life is
[59:51] Jesus these are all representations but
[59:55] very powerful ones
[59:57] what a glorious truth and that's what I
[1:00:01] was going to say about the book of the
[1:00:02] revelation we we know that that is not
[1:00:05] the revelation of st. John the Divine
[1:00:07] it's what the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:00:10] has given us Saint John the Divine
[1:00:12] so that whole book is a revelation of
[1:00:14] Jesus now we know the whole Bible is the
[1:00:16] revelation of Jesus and and we know that
[1:00:19] that book of redemption was that book
[1:00:21] that was once sealed with seven seals
[1:00:23] and yes I'm getting just a bit ahead of
[1:00:25] myself but I want to leave you with
[1:00:26] something to chew on if you if you can
[1:00:28] and that is this when when we pick up in
[1:00:32] Revelation chapter 10 we see another
[1:00:35] mighty angel coming down with an open
[1:00:37] book in his hand because the seals have
[1:00:39] already been loosed correct and here's
[1:00:41] something very very powerful very simple
[1:00:44] but very powerful John is told don't go
[1:00:47] through the book don't just read the
[1:00:49] book don't just quote the book
[1:00:52] eat it
[1:00:55] eat it does that fit the continuity of
[1:00:58] Scripture it does Jesus said take eat
[1:01:02] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:01:05] this was John coming into
[1:01:08] synchronization
[1:01:10] he was coming into divine sync with what
[1:01:13] had been written about his own life and
[1:01:15] ministry in the heavenlies you believe
[1:01:16] John was chosen for the job had to be
[1:01:19] you believe every devil in Hell tried to
[1:01:21] stop John you believe they tried to make
[1:01:24] a french fry out of him banished him to
[1:01:26] an island thinking he would die if there
[1:01:28] if the wild beasts didn't kill him there
[1:01:31] might be a few remaining phoebs and
[1:01:33] vagabonds there who would kill him and
[1:01:35] might even eat him they meant to get rid
[1:01:38] of him but God was preserving him
[1:01:40] because he wasn't finish living out
[1:01:43] fleshing out hear me he wasn't finished
[1:01:46] fleshing out his book he wasn't finished
[1:01:49] living out his story
[1:01:53] in fact it couldn't be until he ate it
[1:02:01] but when he ate that book he was eating
[1:02:04] the lamb he was eating the revelation of
[1:02:07] Jesus Christ that had been hidden
[1:02:09] underneath those seals he was eating
[1:02:10] Christ in reality it was a divine
[1:02:13] experience and his commission then
[1:02:16] followed not the only Commission he ever
[1:02:19] had his final Commission the last one he
[1:02:23] was going to get you eat this book it's
[1:02:27] going to be bitter in your belly sweet
[1:02:28] in your mouth bitter in your belly and
[1:02:30] then prophesy again think about that
[1:02:34] becoming one with the word becoming one
[1:02:37] with what you eat and you're eating the
[1:02:39] book and the book is Jesus Christ you
[1:02:42] want to know what your life is about
[1:02:44] your life is revealed I'm sure there are
[1:02:46] details somewhere else but your life is
[1:02:48] revealed in the book of redemption and
[1:02:50] God has carefully designed a plan to get
[1:02:54] you an eye-to-eye you and I out of the
[1:02:56] confusion of Babylon so that we could
[1:02:59] come to a book so that we could come to
[1:03:01] a truth and eat that truth and be
[1:03:03] changed by what we eat how important is
[1:03:05] the word let's stand how important is
[1:03:08] the word how important is the message of
[1:03:12] the hour very important very important
[1:03:16] because it reveals Jesus but it doesn't
[1:03:20] just reveal Jesus it reveals you because
[1:03:23] when the book was written about him your
[1:03:26] name your life was written in the same
[1:03:29] book God's got you brother sister hear
[1:03:33] me we're done God's got you he's got you
