Minister Lord all of us are in a battle but God you promised that we would all if we would agree with heaven we would see the glory of the Lord Upon Us Lord that is what we are pressing toward the very glory of God in our lives Lord for each one of these needs Lord I know that there are heavy hearts among us at the Lost Lord of life but God I as at these Seasons that we remember that you are

For Your Glory will make these Provisions I thank you Lord for what you are doing Among Us and as we hear the word today we're asking that you would let that anointing rest upon our pastor as he would

brother Austin I'm glad the Lord touched you and sister Anna we're going to receive the tithe and offering while strashley sings today brother Elias and brother Austin Yantis we you two brothers come

mortgage of this property we are well on our way we're going to get rid of this debt the balance now is at 36 507.46 it's out of here by the grace of God [Applause] thank you [Music] distasteful said about our praise that we're putting on a show [Music] don't know or you've never had the chance to hear just where I've been to know where I came from cause if you'd seen the chains I wore and how heavy they were then you might understand why I act the way I do cause if you'd been there when you found me it was all praise came to rescue me from my life of sin I know what it feels like to be bound up in Chains now I appreciate what freedom feels like that's why let's watch out why I can't why I pray [Music] is [Music] Jesus Paid the price so I didn't have to stay lost that's why that's why I praise [Music] my whole life changed the day that Jesus walked in who gave me Beauty for Ashes [Music] like I do I do cause he who the sun sets free is [Music] purchases [Music] it's been said about our praise that it's disgraceful distasteful said about our praise [Music] you've never had the chance [Music] praise came to rescue me from my life of sin I know what it feels like to be bound up in Chains so now I appreciate what freedom feels like that's why I shout why I dance [Music] [Music] so I didn't have to stay lost [Music] [Music] [Music] like I do [Music] well Glory [Music] [Applause] you may be seated isn't he wonderful isn't he worthy of radical exuberant praise amen did you write that Ashley this week or you've been working on it two two weeks ago let's thank God again [Applause] [Music] she's writing music to Chronicle what God's doing in this hour isn't that a blessing she must have been reading Instagram because they're what one man said one man this week he said well they have to act like that because they don't have truth and I thought well I'm going to check you out dude I'm going to see what you believe he was a Jehovah's Witness yes have mercy God and uh oh we get all kinds of comments and Anna Christine is busy it's almost a 40 hour a week job keeping up with all the comments some if they're real distasteful we take them off but like I told her yesterday I'm really enjoying this and and every day I get notifications so and so so and so followed you because of the real so and so followed you from the real so and so followed you from the real so there are people who who maybe they subscribe just to laugh at us I don't know but maybe God will get a hold of some of his heart and there are some people that we don't ever defend I'm not going to tell you that I won't but so far I've been very very careful made very few comments back but we don't always have to because there are plenty of people who take offense and and they get on there and say you've just never been you've just never been in that kind of sit you've just never been in that atmosphere and etc etc so we give God the praise we don't feel sorry for ourselves but I will tell you this if you see that a real has gone up and one of these singers is involved you should use that as a Target to remember to pray for them because just the fact that their faces and their songs are being put out in the public sturge Warfare against them in the spirit and so you when you see it if whoever it is if it's sister Jai or brother Josh or or sister Megan she really is getting it lately uh or or this week they posted the the quartet there singing on four of them and whoever it is if you see it you see their picture you say oh God cover them by the blood of Jesus and raise up a standard against the enemy that would war against them you may not recognize it but there are witches there are warlocks there are all kinds of people in dark magic and dark witchcraft who see something like that and they they try they practice they practice with spells they practice with curses but we just say that no curse can stick on a child of God if there's no cause if you're being cursed and there's no cause for the curse it can't stand in the blood of Jesus it can never stand and I know that sometimes people don't take it quite serious enough but it's a serious matter and uh well I guess my face is out there quite a few times in the course of a week so I hope you'll pray for me and my family I want to thank you for praying for Stacy she is here you do not have to hug her she won't her have her feelings hurt uh you don't have to get near her if you don't want to but she according to her doctor she was five days in quarantine this uh strain is affecting people quite differently and they are saying that five days after symptoms show up it is no longer contagious and I will tell you on her behalf you don't want it you don't want it and I know that it's affecting people different ways she never had a cough she never had congestion she never had sinus issues but she was four days in the bed with an excruciating headache and extreme nausea those were mostly the only symptoms that she had and uh we've been married a long time now and I've never seen her quite that sick unable to move unable to get up hardly and it's the grace of God to touch her the way he has and she did test positive and uh after that they were giving her a little something for nausea there's nothing else that they can do you are probably safer at church than you are at the grocery store so if you've been at the grocery store this week you might notice the mass coming back on I saw people I was at home from Sunday after lunch until Friday never left the house stayed close I was in quarantine in one end of the house because I didn't really want to get it she was in quarantine and the other I've slept on an air mattress every night this week so you can you can hug me if you want to if you don't some of you don't anyway so I won't I won't be too offended I'll just assume you didn't like the preaching or something I don't know but if we didn't feel like that it was safe for her to be here and safe for you for her to be here she wouldn't be here today we're we're some of the most cautious people here we're not fearful before there was a covid uh we we came with fevers my children came to church the whole time they were growing up with fevers we just figured God was on the throne and he was taking care of it but then covet comes along and it makes us aware uh we didn't have church Tuesday night because we didn't know who else in our family would get it if it would spread if we would bring it to church and so it's been a long week amen but we're just thankful I'm telling you God performed a miracle for her to be able to even be here today and uh there was no improvement until Friday and and then the Improvement started so uh let's be careful let's wash our hands let's do all the things that we know to do but uh unless you feel it necessary please don't don't be one of those who has to drive around town in a car by yourself with a mask really Friday I got out for the first time and and I saw people and I'm thinking I I would smother in my own vehicle no one else in my vehicle with a mask on and pull it down it breathe enjoy air while you can if you want to wear it around people then that's your business but but God is so good you could feel that fear creeping up I could feel it creeping up as I the one day I was out on Friday I could feel it creeping up in the atmosphere and fear does nothing except invite trouble it's a magnet Faith always gets the job done do you believe that so we have a real host I know there are quite a few people out today some are traveling some will be traveling next weekend we have camp meeting coming up in October 3rd through the 7th I believe are the dates and we want you to be praying already for that Brother Juan arnoldus from South Africa will be coming with his wife uh if you want to check his ministry out it's bride's Revival Ministry and we have been acquainted through letters through through uh messenger through through emails now for over 20 years and it has been their dream to come this week after I heard a few weeks ago that he was coming and I've been praying about their coming excited about their coming we were praying about it and we feel led of the Lord to invite him to minister to us while he's here so we sent the invitation and he graciously accepted I send the invitation like I do uh always you we would very much like for you to come we don't want to cause you any trouble our church is very criticized we don't want we don't want there to be any any uh you know problem for you by association and uh but the the fact is we're we're Associated already we're already in the same Club the freedom Club like Ashley was singing about just a minute ago and so he has graciously accepted and he'll be doing some speaking for us during camp meeting unfortunately brother Brooks will not be able to come he pastors two churches and travels all the time and he just couldn't get an extra weekend away but I have invited him for the next two one of the two whichever he can come for are our fellowship meetings after camp meeting either either by the end of the year the first of next year and he has said I absolutely want to do that so there's nothing wrong in our fellowship I heard from him this morning again and we're in very much very good Fellowship but God knows I'm not I'm not even concerned or worried I just prayed a couple weeks now before inviting brother arnoldus to come and and to do some he was coming anyway and and you know that means something to me and I trust him and I think you'll be blessed by his ministry and whoever else the Lord provides but we have a lot of birthdays this week today is talia's birthday uh where is she is she in here tally you just went out well maybe I can catch her at the end when she comes back in today is Maya not last week but today today is Maya gossa's birthday let's say happy birthday to Maya [Applause]

Tuesday the sister fellow it's kind of once you reach a certain age you you you look at a birthday and you kind of make a little more attention every five years you know like the right the evening like if it's a 70 like if you were 70 or 75 or 80 so uh anyhow that was slick wasn't it it's kind of a big one coming up God's been so good to her when I think about it I I really appreciate the Lord uh Wednesday as sister Donna Hall's birthday a long time streamer and friend we say happy birthday to her and then Thursday the 31st is sister fousey's birthday all the way in Japan and I know she'll watch this God bless you Sister for Save [Applause] Friday is sister Beth Polk's birthday not feeling well today but will be will be feeling better soon happy birthday sister Beth I'm not done this is

going to be on Saturday she gets one more birthday as a single woman in that amazing God bless sister Jennifer it's also sister Anna Miller's birthday next Saturday happy birthday sister Anna I'm more slap out than hadn't even preached yet and it's also next Saturday it's also uh brother brother Josh and sister hope Alano's anniversary how many how many years is this six years happy anniversary to them [Applause] when I finish baptizing last Sunday and went in and we changed and said goodbye to Sister Flo and to brother Trey and his wife Autumn I want to say this to thank you all for coming we just mentioned there at the end if a few of you wanted to come and I thought well there won't be very many they don't know him and and and there won't be many come I was so I was so blessed uh at how many came thank you all I appreciated that didn't you sister Flo we had a crowd in the backyard and I appreciated that because their baptism is just as important as anybody else's baptism and I know you people didn't know them but the thought that you would come and celebrate uh something that took well almost 30 years to to come to fruition because he he had said as you heard last weekend to Sister Flo when I when I get old enough to do what I want to do about it because he was his family certainly wasn't for baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said I want your preacher to baptize me and so it took a few years for that to come around but it has come around and we were blessed to baptize him so after that was over I had a cute little card handed to me and I regretted that I I didn't get it while I could see them but got it later but it's the cutest little card here and a little design on the bottom like a ultrasound I don't know if that's a real ultrasound or not but kind of like that and and and in childlike uh font I want to read it to you it says brother Shelly pleased with the Z please pray for us we ask Jesus for a Dino and a Truck he gave us a baby

issue taken care of now but many people were letting us know that we needed some work on the sound and wherever you're listening God bless you so many from so many different places and some are saying we love you sister Flo uh and they're Wishing you happy birthday from other places sister Naomi is thanking you for birthday greetings so she was listening and and different ones let's stand yes honey is it Saturday I thought it was after Saturday oh I'm so sorry how could I miss that um I honestly didn't have it on my calendar and so I thought well it must be next week tally we we were gonna wish you happy birthday but you weren't in here I call her taliana or Pollyanna but she's our sweet girl would you all say happy birthday to tally Talia [Applause] and then that's today and then on

[Applause] we give you praise and honor and Glory would you thank the Lord for the musicians and the singers worship leading and turn in your bibles if you will again please the Hebrews chapter 4. verse 11 and 12 is where we will start this morning in our study together Hallelujah let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of what Soul and Spirit and of the joints and Marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart can you say Amen let's take that in the Amplified and then we'll have our seats again let us therefore be zealous and exert ourselves and strive diligently to enter that rest of God to know and experience it for ourselves that no one may fall or perish by the same kind of unbelief and Disobedience into which those in the wilderness fell for the word that God speaks this is so powerful for the word that God speaks is alive and full of power making it active operative energizing and what effective it is sharper than any two-edged sword penetrating to the dividing line of the Breath of Life Soul and the immortal spirit and of joints and Marrow of the deepest parts of our nature exposing and sifting and analyzing and judging the very thoughts and purposes or intentions of the heart father we thank you today for another opportunity to celebrate who you are in our lives we are under the Revelation that we must know both who and what we are in this hour it is impossible for us to be positionally placed in the Kingdom Affairs without knowing who and what we are so today Lord may your word be active may your word be operative may your word be energizing and may it be effective to us personally individually may your word divide penetrating the very Soul the breath of life and the immortal Spirit May It Go deeply into the deepest recesses of our nature may it Expose and sift and analyze and judge our very thoughts and purposes and intentions of the heart we as a body of Believers surrender to the authority of your word turn the sword of your word the two-edged sword of your word in our direction we pray today and may we actively participate not with just our amen but may we put our faith on the line May there be something in every cell of our body that responds to that word may we like Mary say to you today be it unto me according to Thy word have your will and weigh in my life we ask this in the matchless and mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory we pray and the church said amen you may be seated we're continuing with the sword the labor and the rest when we focus for a moment on these passages of scripture there is something that sounds rather contradictory it seems that we must labor to find rest that goes against everything that we understand about both labor and about rest we perceive rest as the opposite of labor but the Apostle Paul did not teach us that rest is the opposite of labor labor is something necessary and it is not physical exertion that the apostle was talking about he's talking about a spiritual demonstration he's talking about not what we do with our hands or even what we do with our brain he's talking about what we do with our inner man we put our Inner Man in when the word is going forth and we hold it before the Lord and we say Do by your word for me and in me what I cannot do for myself I am convinced today church that if we could perfect ourselves we would already have been raptured out of here if we could improve ourselves spiritually on our own with our own willpower we would have probably already been out of here but it's an it's an impossibility it is futile to try by striving this labor is not about striving this labor is about spiritual work there's a difference in physical work and spiritual work it requires spiritual discipline and if you're not a disciplined person in the natural you'll struggle more than anyone else to be spiritually disciplined remember it is not how much reading you do it is not how how many religious things you do it's about what you do from your spirit man it's not what you do as an act of your will only that we're talking about we're talking about something spiritual a transaction action that is spiritual that must take place between you and the word how many of you think you understand that so it's not just reading the Bible it's not just hearing the preaching it's about how we hear you see he didn't just tell us to be careful what we hear he tells us to be careful how we hear and what Jesus is talking about in that verse is you must do your part as the word is going forth you must participate actively with your spirit man and I described just a moment ago what that looks like you you hold your inner being your spiritual man the spiritual part of Who You Are Soul and Spirit you hold that before the Lord when the word is going forth and you say as I just said a moment ago you say to the Lord may your word accomplish in me right now everything that I have need of see we don't draw closer to God or deeper in the word we do on the outside it's only what we do on the inside that brings us into closer relationship with him are you with me today we have some ground to cover so I need your help in the message Hebrews chapter 4 paragraph 92. brother banham says this now watch he's talking about the law wasn't mixed with faith they didn't keep it they kept the Sabbath in a memorial that they were going to a land of Sabbath to have everlasting rest from all their troubles and all their worries no more task Masters no more restless nights they were on their way to the promised land of rest it flowed with milk and honey The Grapes was so big that two men Pat one Bunch over their shoulders oh what a land of blessed rest but they failed to get it when they got there because of their unbelief can you imagine coming all the way to the entrance of the promised land and not finding the faith to cross over you can look across the river and see everything you've been moving towards all of your 40 Years of journeying is behind you and you can now see and perhaps a fragrance floats across the water to where you're standing and you not only see the rest you not only can hear the sounds of the beautiful birds and beautiful expressions of God's creation but maybe you're close enough that you can smell the grapes I need you with me this morning you can smell the grapes it it's so close that you can feel it you can smell it you can see it and then realize there's something standing between you and Crossing that River and inheriting everything that God has prepared for you there's only one thing that will ever keep you out there's only one sin and that's unbelief and we may feel like as believers that we can't have any of that in US well I want you to know that's just not the way it is because we're living in a body of Flesh and we're living with a soul that likes to reason come on we'll get there in a minute and and so unbelief is something that that a real believer may have to deal with on a fairly regular basis but what we need to do is be so spiritually Discerning that when that doubt begins to creep in and that unbelief against a scream in our head we need to be so Discerning that we take the sword and we start dealing with that unbelief and dealing with a lie and dealing with that in the contrary or negative thought and we don't do it when we get a chance but we take a chance immediately to deal with it I'm telling you if you don't deal with it immediately you'll go on to something else on your phone you'll keep scrolling we can't treat our spiritual life like we treat our natural life and just scroll up or scroll down we must stop and deal with unbelief and we must do it immediately and sometimes we might need to call one another into accountability you're speaking death you need to Speak Life because death produces what death what does life Words of Life produce life they fail to get in when they got there because of what they're unbelief they were turned aside at one at only 40 miles from where they left Egypt do you realize how easy it would have been how short of a journey it would have been I don't mean easy as though there had been no struggle it's a desert it's still 40 miles not like it is today you just jump in the car and go it wouldn't take you a little while or an airplane wouldn't take you they're still walking and there's a lot of them to get there but it shouldn't have took 40 years to go 40 miles can anybody say Amen to that but here they were from where they left in Egypt to the promised land and they were 40 years getting there why because of their unbelief so all that God was trying to do for them and in them and through them was not accomplishing what it needed to accomplish why because they weren't doing their part they weren't submitting them they said we believe the law we believe the instruction and we're obeying to the best of our ability to do what we're told to do we're keeping the rules so to speak but I want to tell you something salvation true Born Again experience is not accomplished by keeping the rules it's an Act of Faith it's a spiritual exchange it's purchased with spiritual currency and not with natural sweat it's it's labor but it's not toil and there's a difference and we'll see that in the scripture in just a while they're 40 years getting there why because of their unbelief let's go on God gave them their prophet gave him his sign gave him the pillar of fire showed signs and wonders preached the gospel to them and they walked out after the fishes and Loaves and fell in the wilderness and their carcasses perished in the wilderness see they ate the manna they ate the quail hello they drank the water they saw God purify the bitter water and still they weren't doing their part God was doing his part how many of you believe God is faithful he never misses or fails to do his part but you and I have a part in this we must put something in we must give something of ourselves spiritually to the truth that we hear so let's go on Jesus at the fountain he said our fathers eat Manna in the wilderness for 40 years said I am that bread of life that come from God out of Heaven I am the bread of life Moses didn't give you that bread my father gave that bread and I am the bread that comes from God out of Heaven if a man eats this will never die that's the difference now what does that sound like to you what what does that bring up in your mind if eating the living bread which is Jesus Christ if it gives us eternal life does that remind you of the tree of life it's a representation of the very same person the Lord Jesus Christ now brother Branham describes the the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil in several different ways in fact if you follow the message he identifies it as several different things but he's always clear about who the tree of life is sometimes he calls the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil the woman sometimes he calls us to calls the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Satan but he's always clear on who the tree of life is it's the same one who stood among them and said I am the bread of life you you taste of me and you're never going to get hungry again and what he was saying by that is you'll only want to eat who I am you'll only want to partake of who I am like he said to the woman at the well it's not that you won't ever be thirsty again but there's no other water that will ever satisfy you again once you've tasted the water that I am not just the water that I give but the water that I am are you with me he said they'll never die there's the difference okay let's go on now watch they they said that they they drank from the rock that was in the wilderness for the space of so many years he said I am that rock Blessed Be His holy name I am that rock how could he be that Rock that Rock was a spiritual rock it followed the children of Israel that rock was a spiritual rock it represented Jesus Christ himself even our Lord was with them in the wilderness journey and provided water for them it followed the children of Israel and Moses had a stick in his hand which was what a judgment Rod of God and God told him to Smite The Rock and he smote The Rock and when he did Waters came from the Rock and Christ helped me was that rock and the Judgment of God's penalty of sin was struck upon Him hallelujah thank God can you imagine that almost every page of the Wilderness Journey as you're reading about the wanderings of the children of Israel through the Wilderness it's Jesus screaming on almost every page he was The Rock Hallelujah he was the pillar of fire he was the cloud by day it just goes on and on and on he was the tabernacle he was the showbread he was the holy of holies he was the way in it just goes on and on and on it's all screaming about the one amen not not three one one God hear o Israel the Lord thy God is what he's one and Christ was that rock and the judgments of God's penalty of sin was struck upon him God caused to lay on him the iniquity of us all and that iniquity bursted forth his heart and from his heart poured Holy Spirit powerful what happened when they struck the rock water poured out what happened at Calvary water poured out fulfilling the very typology of the scripture that iniquity bursted his forth his heart and from his heart poured out Holy Spirit like rivers of water to a perishing dying people Ashley was singing about being one of those how many other perishing dying people were in here how many of you ever remember spiritually you were perishing and dying and water came out to meet your needs water out of the very Heart of Jesus Christ water out of the very Heart Of God provided for us I am that rock that was in the wilderness thank God for that I am that rock that was in the wilderness let's grab another one in the message communion paragraph 119. he appeared to Eve as an angel of Light he told her sure the Lord said this the Lord said this but he disagreed with God right at the end and that's the way false communion does today that's pretty serious you can go back and hear that in context it's a great message to hear he's referring several times in this message about true communion and false communion now we're not talking about Bread and Wine remember communion is more than unleavened bread and wine communion is spiritual communion is a spiritual exchange that's what faith is faith is not just an abstract faith is the evidence of things hopeful it's a substance and evidence of things hoped for so when we when we talk about this communion we're not talking about the the wine and the bread we're talking about a spiritual relationship and and no one is going to enjoy such a relationship as that like the Bride of Jesus Christ this is what God was after from before the foundation of the world to have a people that he could have spiritual communion with spiritual fellowship with how is that possible it's Spirit to Spirit Fellowship it's your spirit that's been regenerated by the Holy Spirit having fellowship with him who is the eternal spirit I'm telling you there's nothing like it I experienced some of it this morning when I was in the presence of the Lord I was experiencing some of that spiritual exchange and you are too if you're if you're going about your praise in the right way if you're praising in the right way it will lead you to a place of worship which becomes communion praise is not communion praise is the way to get to communion and it's wrong to judge praise really it's wrong to judge somebody's praise some people knock like this some people knock a little louder some of us when we want to get somebody's attention [Music] now I may tell you that your little old puny knock is not going to get me to the door because I can't hear it but I may not be able to change the way you knock I'm not gonna but when I'm coming into that presence and I know I got to get through some stuff to get there I'm not coming to the door like that we're talking Ashley again we're talking what she was singing about again what were the two what were the in verse one what were the two words you said people people call it disgraceful and distasteful Monarch is distasteful that makes me want to knock harder none of your business how I knock good somebody else's pray I tell you what if I could get in with that I would yes sir I'd be just like my granny she saw remember she looked down there in the altar bench and she saw sister Havens Carter get the Holy Ghost she said she looked like an angel it looked like a light was on her face and her lips were just barely moving and stammering lips and a little language was coming out just a quiet little little language was coming out of her lips and her she said there wasn't a wrinkle in her dress she said she looked just like a saint and she said oh Lord I want the Holy Ghost like that you don't get to choose how you receive him she said I got him all right but I didn't get him like Havens Carter she said I ran and I jumped and I laughed and I cried and I rolled and I beat the Wall now who is to say that either of those experiences is not the right one I know what the prophet said he said a real birth is a mess and he said it didn't matter whether it takes place in a grubby old stable or in the fine uh Peak hospital room a birth is a messy exchange Hallelujah no one should judge the way you approach him now I do believe that things should be done decently and in order I don't think we ought to be coming in here to try to draw attention to ourselves but you can usually tell if somebody's got a little a way of watching to see who's watching them don't do that it got quiet don't do what you're going to do to praise the Lord and then look to see if anybody's watching you just assume they are Hallelujah and turn it up don't be intimidated by somebody's wandering eye and don't put on a shelf for them but get ready to get to him because communion doesn't take place in the praise communion excuse me I'm sorry what's going on with my voice communion takes place in the in the realm of Glory and Glory the atmosphere of Heaven comes to respond to our praise did you hear me the atmosphere of Heaven comes on us to respond to our praise and when we get in glory when we realize we have broken in to the atmosphere of heaven and Glory has begun to come into the room that's when you don't want to hoop anymore that's when you don't want to holler anymore that's when you don't want to jump pews anymore that's when you just want to stand in his glory and have communion you want to have communion with him his Spirit communing with your spirit that looks exactly like his the reason why they're so much confusion on spirit and soul part of that is because of our understanding of what a spirit is we think of a spirit as being a motivating Fallen entity and we say there's a spirit of jealousy on her or I'm dealing with a spirit of resentment or a spirit of bitterness and when we think in those terms then we don't see clearly what Holy Spirit really is and sometimes I grew up hearing this expression he has such a mean spirit now when brother banham is pray preaching in the beginning he had the order like the Bible gives us the order body Soul and Spirit years later in his life he would do both there'd be a sermon he'd say one order and another sermon he said another order and then in the end of his ministry he would always say body Soul excuse me Body Spirit and soul as the inside of the inside if you will do a search you'll find brother Branham talking about things like a cantankerous spirit I grew up hearing people say he has such a mean Spirit about him I hear people say oh she has such a sweet spirit and when you have that kind of an idea of what a spirit is you can easily get confused about what's happened in your spirit when when we say that we are Body Soul and Spirit we're not talking about our personality when brother Branham says that the that the uh spirit is the nature of the Soul he's talking about the way it behaves is that right the nature of something and so if someone has a problem in their soul their their demeanor their spirit is contaminated by what's going on in their soul so I totally understand what he's preaching to us but that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about how you're made you are made Body Soul in the middle and spirit on the inside of the inside and you're born with a fallen spirit when you get here it's already corrupt the Bible said we came into this world we're shaping an iniquity and we come into this world doing what speaking lie do you have to teach a child to be prejudiced you do yes you do yes you do you have to teach a child to be prejudiced but you don't have to teach a child to lie that's where I caught you you thought I was going to say lie you don't have to teach a child to be to to lie now I'm going to get confused they come into the Earth with that ability it's just a nature that they have why because their spirit's Fallen you take a little innocent child precious and beautiful and wonderful and your grandbaby and perfect in every way and you walk into the room and say did you get a cookie I mean we've got Houdini's around here I wonder sometime about my children maybe they just weren't as intelligent as children are today because they didn't act like children act today they never drew a chair out and climbed up on top of the cabinet and went over the refrigerator and took treats out never and that's because they weren't allowed to go in a cabinet without permission that was our rule if you're going to take something out of a cabinet you have to get permission to do that but we've got them in here right here this morning that are Houdini's that they're there they can do all kinds of things they can crawl up on the counter and and open it up and eat a whole box of goodies and then you walk in the room crumbs on their chin crumbs on their t-shirt or their belly a cookie with a big bite out of it in the hand and you say you were not in the cookies were you no the evidence is all over them but they come into this world with a fallen spirit and that affects the soul that affects the mind and the will and the emotion and so it's easy then for them to say yes I'm not guilty I didn't do it now what they say I hear most uh he did it who taught them to blame somebody else she did it it's a fallen spirit do you understand and all you got to do is fix the spirit that nature has to to change brother Branham said we've got to have a nature change and the only place in our nature can be changed is at the foot of the cross it's by the blood of the Lamb it's only by Jesus Christ that we get a nature change how many of you understand all things have passed away behold All Things become new I am a new creation in Christ ah the things I once loved I hate and the things I once hated I now love what's happened something has happened in your spirit your human Spirit not your demeanor we're not talking about someone who has a mean Spirit or a sweet Spirit or a kind Spirit that's what we're talking about it's a misuse of the word what we're talking about is someone who's born with a fallen Spirit which every person in this room was born with a fallen spirit because of what Adam and Eve did in the garden and once you get Jesus in that Spirit once eternal life gets in that Spirit it changes who you are you are no longer the same man you are no longer the same woman that's what salvation does that's what the born-again experience does and here's what's so powerful if you get the inside of the inside changed and how does that take what actually takes place Pastor what actually takes place you take it's it's a deposit just like just like Adam received a deposit of the Divine here he lay created Out of the Dust out of the dirt out of the clay of the ground and he looks just like a man would look he is formed in the image of God but he's lifeless he has no life now when we talk about life that's when we're talking about spirit the Bible tells us that God breathed what can you help me here he breathed the breath of life into Adam brother Brandon one time said that's like the adding of the Dynamics again to the mechanics a perfectly formed body but no life until God came down with with with a mouth to mouth and blew into Adam the very Breath of Life which is not natural it's spiritual so spiritual life was breathed into Adam and what did it do it it came he was once a body now God's life breath is breathed into him and his his whole demeanor his his hope his whole being is changed and he is not now just a body of clay he's now Body Soul and Spirit because the Bible said he became a what a living soul from that moment on Adam now has a body to live in he has a soul that connects his Spirit to his body that's what the soul is it's it's it's it's a gift of God to to connect your spirit man to your physical body and in that Soul Man became a living soul in that Soul his mind his mind not his brain his mind his will did you know Adam didn't have a will until God breathed life into him when God breathed life into him he was capable of having a mind a thought process he was capable of having a will to choose or to reject and he was capable of what else mine will he was now capable of having emotion had had God not breathed Spirit into him life he would have ever laid there as a body of clay now when that spirit your Fallen Spirit meets living life Spirit the Breath of God and that's breathed into you in the New Birth it starts changing you not from the outside in that's religion religion believes that you can change what's on the inside by keeping the rules unfortunately the religious Jewish world today still believes that they can change the inside by keeping the rules on the outside but that's not God order the order is not changed from body to Soul to Spirit the change is Spirit soul to body when that when your Fallen human Spirit receives the life of God the Breath of God your human Fallen spirit is regenerated it's recreated it's remade it is not what it was now we don't believe two souls or two spirits it's it's not a replacement it's a regeneration he takes up Fallen spirit that always lies it always leads you to make the wrong decision Adam one born with a fallen spirit Adam was born with a perfect spirit I'm stating this over and over and slowly because I want every person to be able to understand why we use the order that we use it's the only one that fits the scripture and I am not of the impression that we that we adjust the scripture to follow a quote you don't have to have an opinion but I am of the strong conviction that if there is a conflict in an expression in a quote and what the scripture said we take the scripture we don't have to spend our life criticizing hello but you can't preach eternal hell one time and a few years later preach no eternal hell and be thus saith the Lord both times is anybody going to dare to say Amen it can't be perfect both times you can't preach at the white horse rider is Jesus Christ and then preaches Antichrist and it'd be perfect both times so somebody said how do we know the difference we go to the absolute we go to what the word said hallelujah how many of you know Jesus is not riding with a bow and no errors we we understand it by the message and by the word but the word of God listen the prophet's quote book will work he's wasn't constantly saying like I said the other day like I said the other day like I said in the message one's on paragraph 11. it's quiet he said it's written it's written it's written so everything your pastor says it has to line up with the word of God everything your Prophet says has to line up with the word of God come on now it can't be thus saith the Lord both times it can't be perfect both times one time a human must have been speaking and then thus saith the Lord comes and it settles it all hello prophets are not infallible I know you hear it over and over they're not infallible somebody said how can you know that because they're men who have bodies who have souls mine will and emotion and they have spirits let me tell you something that wasn't thus saith the Lord that caused Moses to this to disbelieve and miss and and disobey God's command that was an infallibility or inerrancy that was a human being that was a man who struggled in his position if God would have wanted him to be a perfect vessel he would have created him to be a perfect vessel but God knew exactly what Moses was and chose him because of who he was hello God chooses You Because of Who You Are he don't turn his back and not know who you are and accidentally Choose You for his purpose he chooses you because of who you are because there's nothing in you that he can't redeem he is a redeemer by Nature are you with me this morning and so here's what happens when you're born again his spirit is placed on your spirit and your spirit is regenerated it is given New Life and therefore you are not living today with the same human spirit that you were born with because the spirit of Jesus Christ has regenerated that Fallen spirit that has tendency toward death can't die but it has tendency toward death it can fall and it was Fallen now you get the holy spirit in your life it regenerates your Fallen human Spirit it now becomes a new spirit in Christ because you're a new creature and guess what happened it starts working through the soul and our goal is to have our soul LED by our spirit instead of our flesh how many of you recognize when your flesh is leading you it's just one Tuesday night hello I really helped the preacher last Sunday but I'm tired today and I've got a headache I guarantee you that's not your spirit telling you that I know that's not the spirit of Jesus Christ in you telling you that where is that message coming from it's coming from the body of Flesh come on I want you to know the most beautiful thing about fully adopted Sons when they begin to fully manifest they're going to come forth in such Authority because they are spirit-led instead of body lead flesh-led and they're not going to be it's like this and I haven't used this example in a little while but let me use it here and then move on we could say for instance that whatever you feed the most is going to rule in your life you believe that brother Branham talks about the Indian story of two dogs black dog on one shoulder white dog on one shoulder and and you know uh they're both talking one of them is saying do the right thing what I'm saying do do what you want to do or do the wrong thing and and which one are you going to listen to well you're going to listen to the to the loudest and what determines which one's louder the one you feed the most you understand so if you're feeding your soulish man will and emotions more than you're feeling your spirit man the regenerated Fallen human Spirit that's now become the spirit of Christ Living inside of you if you're feeding the Salish man more than the spirit man this the soulish man well he begins to look like a sumo wrestler and the Little Spirit man inside of you begins to look like a little stick man who's going to get the job done the sumo wrestler if you keep feeding the soul the mind the will and the emotion if you keep feeding constantly the mind and the will and the emotion how do we do that by entertainment by by negative things by by negative movies by negative environments by negative talk by listening to dirty jokes by telling dirty jokes by reading on Facebook things you shouldn't read and you know you know you should read by participating in in blogs and things you shouldn't be on and even podcasted you shouldn't be listening to if it's contrary to the word you better leave that thing alone because it'll make the sumo wrestler in you lead your life and what you really want to do is you want it to be the other way around you don't you don't want to stick man that's your spirit and assume more wrestlers your soul you want to turn that thing around and you want your soul to be like a Stickman whoa and whatever the spirit says not my spirit it's not mine anymore it's his spirit I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you it was God above us and then God with us Emmanuel and now what it is what it is now what it is I'm getting cool in my old age and it is it's God got it that won't make a real God in what it is it's God in us he's no longer just above us he's no longer just with us where is he living in us and I don't want him to shrink because I'm feeding my flesh and feeding my soul oh I want my spirit man to have muscles I want to keep yielding my inner being every time the word goes forward I want to hold my spirit out there and I want to say help me sword of the word help me cut as you go in and cut as you come out but I know I'll be whole I know you won't leave me wounded and bloody I know you won't leave me hurt and in trouble to die by the wayside I know that you both Pierce me and restore me I know that you will both tear me and you will also mend me isn't that what the word does the same word that cuts us heals us the same word that tears us apart puts us back together better than we ever were before somebody ought to help me now oh thank God for what this word is not what it can what it is accomplishing in his body Hallelujah what it is accomplishing I want to thank him for that amen I'll move off of that now he appeared to Eve as an angel of Light told her sure the Lord said this the Lord said this but he disagreed with God right at the end and that's the way false communion does today when people think they're praying to God and won't obey the word going on now when people think they're praying to God and won't obey the word what is that it's false community if he abide in me and my word in you then ask what you will see and it'll be done he said now if it just can't go one time then off the next ye abide in me my words abide in you did you know that abiding is a spiritual Exchange the children of Israel didn't inherit the promised land because there was no abiding in God they feared him but they didn't know how to make communion with him and and we know that they had the opportunity to do so because the Bible tells us they could have invested their faith they could have mixed their faith with the law and it would have accomplished something in them but because they wouldn't carry out the spiritual Exchange they feared the law they kept the law but they didn't have fellowship with the spirit of the law anybody follow that they had no Fellowship no communion with the god of the law with the god of the instruction and because they didn't do that they failed to enter into the rest are you still here they failed to enter into the rest it can't just be so abiding in me and my words abiding in you is is really it's putting the faith in it's recognizing the value of abiding in the word and it's carrying forth the spiritual participation that is necessary to stay in the word and the word stay in you and every bit of that every spiritual Exchange hinges on faith every spiritual exercise that you carry out in your life is only effective if it's demonstrated by faith it's by faith it's by faith it's by faith somebody say it's by faith he said now that abide means to rest there you can't rest in the word automatically without labor you can't stay in the word automatically without labor we're not talking about toil we're talking about Labor abide means to rest there to stay right there yes it's inoculation from sinful diseases does that sound good to you he said now let me close in saying this one word now before we go to the communion table listen carefully the blood and the body of the Lord Plus now we like to say it's the blood and nothing more but it's actually the blood Plus faith you can't be saved by the blood if you don't put your faith in that the truth is truth whether I receive it or not but the truth does not personally operate in Effectiveness in my life without my part come on now so the blood's the most powerful thing I'm telling you there's nothing more powerful than the blood but I can sit right in here today and not be changed by the blood and you sit right by me and be totally changed by the blood because you did what you put your faith there spiritual Exchange so you know to say that we don't have any responsibility in this it's false Doctrine we don't have to look the blood has been shed and the price has been paid all we have to do is believe it isn't that what faith is I believe and when we have that little bit of creeping negative nagging doubt we say Lord I believe help thou my unbelief my spirit believes my soul is where the turmoil lies may I keep feeding the spiritual man until it overrides and leads my soul into the fullness of adoption Hallelujah your soul will never lead your body into the fullness of adoption but your spirit his spirit in you has the power and the authority to lead both your soul and your body into full adoption and into full Redemption feed the spirit man and it won't eat anything but the word it thrives in his presence but it feast on his word spirit of God in you thrives in that corporate atmosphere or the glory is moving why because the same thing you begin to feel is what dwells in you the presence of the Lord is what's dwelling in you so when you get that presence on the inside and that presence you're sitting in the atmosphere of that presence on the outside you say feeling at home in the presence of Jesus oh I'm feeling at home because she's not only in you but his glory is surrounding you oh there's nothing like the glory and the presence the heaviness of God the weightiness the weightiness of his presence around us there's absolutely nothing like it now listen you've got to watch this one carefully it's one o'clock the blood and the body of the Lord I need you to read this because if you don't you may think that the body and the blood is all that's necessary and that's true to him that believeth but you've got to have your belief in there so I'm going to have you to read that I'm going to read this part you read I'm going to read the blood and the body of the Lord you read the next phrase faith is how we access the body faith is how we access the blood let me say that again faith is how we access the blood in the 90s message preachers in many places were de-emphasizing the blood I heard them I heard them because of a of a quote because of a few statements in the message where the Prophet said it wasn't the blood that saved you and he can make that statement because the Bible says we are saved not by Blood it says we are saved by by grace by grace are you saved it is not a Works lest any man should boast but how many of you understand that because Grace is what saved us it does not mean that the blood is not what paid the price and I've explained that to you many times by saying that I still believe that the token price of my Redemption was the blood of God with all my heart I believe that but I believe that I could have never got to the blood and the blood could have never gotten to me had it not been for the transportation of Grace Grace picked up the blood and brought it to my address and said this is what is available for you and my faith said I believe and I'm saved I'm changed the birthing process begins does anybody follow that so Grace is what brings salvation to us the blood is what paid the price for our salvation and faith is what opens the door and gives you the ability to accept the delivery it's your faith otherwise you you look out the window and someone is knocking but but that don't put them on the inside the delivery man is knocking but you can't take the delivery if you don't open the door so faith is what opens the door and says here I want that I want the blood thank you Grace for giving it to me look folks that's more biblically sound than getting up here and singing I'm a sinner saved by grace because anybody knows you can't be both at the same time I was a sinner but now I'm saved by grace I'm no longer a sinner I am now saved by grace in fact the prophet said that settles it that finishes it I am no longer what I was I am now what he is and what did that Grace blood faith the blood in the body of the Lord read it again mixed with faith he said that's the blood and the body that's the spirit and the word read it again the blood in the body of the Lord the word and the spirit of the Lord Plus faith equals how many of you believe you understand what's being said here is powerful power You've Got to Believe You Must Believe you have to you have to make sure I don't care what kind of heavenly sermons you hear I don't care what kind of word of God you sit under the the children of Israel sat under the preaching and teaching of Moses I told you last week he was the only one that God said I'm going to send one like him and he was talking about his own self coming in sun form Jesus was a prophet like unto Moses you couldn't have got any more special I know Jeffersonville says that the last prophet was the greatest prophet but that is not what the Bible tells us I'm going to get a little controversial again the Bible doesn't say the last prophet is the greatest prophet the greatest Prophet is the one in the middle that's the one who came between the Old Testament and the New Testament that's the one who hang Between Heaven and Earth because he was both Prophet both priests and King amen so the greatest prophet of all time is not the messenger to the seventh Church age they say it almost every Saturday I get the email from him almost every Saturday telling us that the greatest Prophet was the last prophet that is not what the Bible said I'm going to stay with the Bible I hear what brother Branham said about that subject any man call himself the greatest of anything is the least of anything it's like brother random said if he would if he'd have went up there if he did how was that I'm gonna came down somebody looking yeah yeah if it had been humble when he went up there on that stage and been humble when he come down he'd been all right God knows how to Humble us amen and we don't have to say things like that we don't have to make make brother Branham the goat the greatest of all time we don't have to make our pastor the goat come on now that's not necessary to follow Jesus you just say Lord thank you for who you are thank you for the prophet that you sent thank you for my pastor thank you for Apostles prophets Pastor teachers and evangelists they're all just a glove on your hand if you work great in US you're the only brother bam said he's the only great one Among Us he was always pointing to the great one Moses however one of the greatest one of the greatest so special that Jesus Christ was the one who was promised to come to us like Moses and so those children of Israel said unto that great Revelation that great teaching and it profited them nothing nothing they couldn't see past The Vessel they couldn't see their own responsibility of receiving the word that was spoken with faith and therefore it profited them nothing and they were banished and not allowed to go into the promised land and this generation is warned scripturally we are warned like every generation before us we're warned scripturally that we don't make the same mistake that we don't sit under the powerful word of God and not be profited by it because we refuse to carry out our part of the spiritual exchange which is to mix every word of God we hear with what faith is that have i belabored the point or do you understand what I'm saying the blood and the body of the Lord mixed with faith he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day the Bible talks about natural communion and those who partake of natural communion unworthily and what happens some are sick among you some are dead because they took this spiritual feast unworthily our little church mind stay with me just a moment our little church mind hears that and we say somebody took that communion with sin in their life somebody took that which I guess all of us have done it because we're not talking about the attributes of sin we're talking about the root of sin which is what unbelief have you ever have you ever been in a struggle but you took communion you drank the wine you ate the bread but you were in a struggle but you know that scripture is not talking about that we've absolutely misunderstood the concept of taking the Lord's supper or taking communion unworthily it's not that you struggle with unbelief it's not that you're not still trying to bring some things into under under the authority of the spirit it's not that you still have soul life because we all have soul life to take the Lord's communion unworthily means not placing proper value on the exchange it actually has nothing to do with your behavior and everything to do with not applying your faith you see when we come through that communion line and we know that we have repented of our sins and we have been baptized in the name of Jesus and and we have received the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're not to come through this line concentrating on our failure or our lack of faith or any unbelief that has crept in or any bad attitude that we might have shown all we have to do about any of that is say Lord have mercy on my heart forgive me do you believe for forgiveness is easier then what we have thought it is it's not begging him it's believing him so when you come through the line what you're doing is saying Lord I value your broken body and the power of your blood I hold it in higher esteem then I do my ability to be worthy of it if we come through the line thinking that we could ever in our flesh and in our soul be worthy of that price hear me there's no compromise in what I'm saying you need not think you could ever in your flesh be worthy of that blood and that bread oh no when we come through that line we should be coming through that line remembering this is the most valuable this represents the most valuable thing in all the universe I'm about to take a sip of wine that represents on the earth the Holy Blood of God I'm about to eat a little piece of bread that represents the broken sinless body of the Lord Jesus Christ and valuing it I honor it I worship on my way I pray I do check my heart and I do ask the Lord to forgive me simply because I don't want to be somebody who tramples the blood I want to be somebody who honors the blood and esteems the blood and values the blood and the body of the Lord did you know that it makes me very sick when I think about how religion shifts the focus off of what he's done and places to know what I do what a cheat what a jip that I spend more of my life focusing on my failure than I do on the worthiness of the price oh Hallelujah thank you for the blood thank you for the broken body there is no sin there is no sin there is no sin that that blood can't redeem [Music] I'm not talking about not getting Deliverance I'm not talking about not looking to be free that's not what I'm talking about I'm talking about religion that causes us to look inward when we're supposed to be looking upward I'm talking about religion that causes us to look in the cell in the wrong mirror we're still looking in the mirror of the law you can't see who good how good Jesus is by looking in the mirror of the law you've got to look in the mirror of his word which is not just law not just instruction it's also Grace you can't just see you can't see where you need to be by just looking at the Old Testament you've got to look at both old and new and what you're going to find out if you're looking at the New Covenant you're going to find out it's not you looking out in the mirror I'm looking in but it's not me looking out it's him he's the man in the mirror he's the one looking out at me and the more I look at him the more like him I can become the more I look at how rotten I am the more rotten I become because I get in that vicious gerbil will cycle of I got to do more I got to do more got to do more got to do more got to do more got to do more and the reality is we're not doing more we need to do less we need to do less religious stuff and more communion so you tell me that praise is not important you tell me the worship service isn't an important part of the service I tell you that the word can have preeminence in a Godly worship service it's not preaching that must take preeminence it's the word you know the word is bigger than a sermon preach to me Pastor you know the word is bigger than a preaching service you know he can show up in the worship service touch your life and you never be the same again why because of the word not because of your worship because the word is living among us he can accomplish look the word can take preeminence in your prayer life if you'd spend more time praying this I wonder if the Lord will ever let me find in this church of people who would spend more time praying effectively instead of constantly thinking I've got to spend more time praying I think you should spend more time praying effectively and what I find to this day even Among Us is this process and I'm going to correct it every chance I get I don't need you to tell me how to pray for your loved ones you either trust my prayer or don't bother me I mean that I don't need you to tell me how to pray the Holy Spirit when we not know not how to pray as we ought the holy spirit will pray through us with are you do you have a little more time with groanings with intercessions it can't be interpreted it can't be understood in the natural but the spirit knows the mind of the spirit I said the spirit knows the mind of the spirit when I read prayer request sometime and I get them from all over the world so don't you feel like I'm directing this to you I get them from all over the world and when and I thought my goodness you really want me to read this to the Lord you really want me to tell God how to do this change his wife hey show her that it's her parents destroying the marriage I get prayer requests like that pray that God will move his boss and give him another boss are you kidding me you know better than God you know better than the Creator how to fix your son's marriage I'm telling you if you're still praying those kind of soulish prayers prayers that that originate in the mind out of your will out of your emotion you're not praying effectively somebody said well teach us one more time how to pray effectively I will but it won't be enough for some of your mindsets but I will teach you right now how to pray effectively master teach us how to pray thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven now take time to follow the Lord's true example acknowledge the worthiness of our father Our Father in case you think that he might forget where he lives who aren't in heaven and when you get to that part maybe you should say and who aren't in me because you now live in me hallowed holy set apart valuable sacred is your name well you can pray an hour telling God how holy how worthy how sacred he is how sacred and holy and worthy his name is if you just need to pray longer because you know the prophet said we needed to pray more I believe that more effectively hallowed holy be thy name thy kingdom come brother that settles it all that takes Biden fixes him that fixes the election that takes care of everything let me tell you something if the kingdom of God would just come it wouldn't matter who who was Democrat who was Republic who it wouldn't matter what any of them are if the kingdom of God would just come remember shall go to come to planet Earth First it comes to the body first thy kingdom come thy will thy will Lord sees your heart you could you could easily say I want my son's marriage whole and healthy and healed thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth you don't need to change her will that's witchcraft prayer you have no authority to pray that someone else's will will be changed you need to pray that your will can be changed oh it's getting quiet stay out of my life if you're going to pray that God will change my will it's soulish it's not spiritual it's not effective you're wasting your breath God gave me a will he will not override it now what he can do and will do not because you said it but because I prayed it Lord I see my will I'm using myself just as an example for you to follow my thought Lord I see that my will is too often in conflict with your will and I'm asking you to let me hear your voice I'm asking you to let me recognize when my will stands in stark contrast with your will and give me Grace to surrender my will my opinion my thought my perception my Paradigm my thought processes to your will if you want to pray effectively for someone else pray O Father may they be drawn into deeper relationship with you that's not witchcraft that's that's that's like saying God bless you did you know brother Rams that's the most powerful thing you could say to somebody God bless you it's a prayer it's not just a blessing it's a prayer and you you answer amen sometimes people get a little haughty if you say that and they say he does but they say it like that he does you ought to say oh he does and yes I need his Blessing I need his Blessing not just to get to heaven but to get to Walmart I need his Blessing I've got to have it thy will be done thy kingdom come can I see it again thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in watch Earth you're not just playing praying for the planet your part Earth your parters remember you're a dual citizen you were created of both elements there's two environments living inside of you you're part Earth and part heaven Adam was part Earth and part heaven so when you pray let your will be done in earth even as it is in heaven you're not just praying Lord bless the world around me and planet Earth and I think I'll go hug a tree to celebrate no no no you're recognizing that you were a part of this Earth and you're asking God's will to be done in you and so when we pray for one another we simply pray oh God let your will be done in my brother in my sister let the very desires of Heaven Break Forth into the realm of the earth oh God make your plan clear to all of us don't exclude yourself when praying for someone else are you still with me you're tired let's go back to finish that quote there you are he that eats my flesh and drinks my blood I know we we did read it but I won't finish it I won't go back and do it one more time has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day there you are what is it the communion of the Lord the word and the spirit the life in the blood the life is in the blood the word and the spirit equals eternal life read the last now I need a few more minutes if you need to go God bless you you can certainly slip out when you need to Hebrews chapter 3 and chapter 4. speak to us about the Exodus about what we leave behind and about what we hope to inherit Hebrews chapter 3 verse 18 through 14. we read it last Sunday let's pick it up again Harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of Temptation in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me proved me and so my works 40 years remember I told you that the complete Jewish Bible refers to that quarrel that that uh provocation as a bitter Coral wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always err in their heart which is their mind remember it's their soul that's where the grieving that's where this doubt that's where this spiritual laziness came in they sat under the word but didn't do their part they do always err in their heart and they have not known my ways so I swear in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest take heed brethren take heed brethren lest there be any of you in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God remember what evil is in Hebrew it's raw Tove is good raw is evil remember Tove means when you begin to bring forth the fruit of the seed that was planted in you God says that's Tove when you are not bringing forth fruit based on the seed of your destiny God calls that evil so when when the Apostle is saying here lest there be any of you with an evil heart of unbelief it means with a mind that is not bringing forth fruit manifesting the seed of Destiny that was planted in you if you and I are not living out a portion of our destiny purpose if God has called you to do something and you're not yet doing it you're yielding your heart for unbelief if you fill your heart and your mind with obedience and faith if you say to the Lord I'm not asking anything of you free of charge I am now I've already taken salvation as a gift but now I am willing to give you my life I will go where you want me to go I'll do what you want me to do I'll say what you want me to say when you're telling that when you're saying that to the Lord on a regular basis use me Use Me Lord use me you're not leaving much room for an evil heart of unbelief you're filling your mind with surrender you're operating in your will to surrender he said take heed Brethren unless there be any of you in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God but exhort one another hello I got to hear it again daily you think two hours on Sunday preaching and one hour on Tuesday night do you think that's enough the word not even close we have to Feast on this word and we have to use this word to encourage and exhort one another every day the word is more effective than than Saint Augustine or Charles Spurgeon or the word all these are wonderful things even the quotes of our Prophet wonderful we live by them we Feast on them let me tell you something nothing has the same power that word of God active and living in us can accomplish so much and we can speak out of that out of that what God's doing in us we can speak out of that to one another but exhort one another daily while it is called today lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin and look at verse 14 for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end Everything Jesus has for us is included in being made partakers of Christ everything we have need of is found in him one amen one uh-huh let me try that again everything we have need of is found in him much better in Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end this is not a time to slack up this is not a time to compromise in any way if we do that it becomes an invitation to the enemy to strengthen his attack against us we cannot give up one inch of ground that has been taken in the spirit hear me now and the Holy Spirit keeps saying to me balance is the most critical word for this hour balance say it with me balance brother Branham told Brother Greene who in turn told the world whatever you do brother Perry keep your balance in the scriptures balance is the most critical word for the hour balance is middle of the road it's the highest spot in a well-built road which we don't have any around here but a well-built road is engineered such that it's taller higher in the middle than it is on the edges it's like this why because the trash the debris washes to the gutter or the random tells us that we should stay in the middle of the road but as an early young preacher in this message I discovered that the middle of the road is not only a a place higher so that the trash can run to the gutter but I found out that if someone truly is determined to stay in the middle of the road and keep your balance in the scripture you are very likely to get run over because human nature tends toward fanaticism and although we get called Fanatics all the time I consider myself as standing in the middle of the road so where does that put some of my friends it's the ones that are getting run over all the time because folks don't embrace you if you stand on the scripture they don't want to follow somebody who wants to stay true to the word who wants to take the message of the hour and lay it within the borders and boundaries of the scripture it's the only place it can stand this message cannot stand apart from the Scripture it must stand in the scripture its strength is because it's founded it's Foundation is the word and we must keep our balance not only in the scripture but in all things moderation and balance is essential in this hour the legalism of the past is not producing the character of Jesus Christ we must understand that legalism is not going to bring us any closer to full adoption but following the word will every day every hour everything Christ has for us involves many things some of which though we are believers we have never fully experienced and in the same manner that many in Israel did not enter Canaan the promise the fullness due to unbelief many Christians will not experience all Christ has for us because of unbelief Hebrews 3 19. so we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief when we look at Hebrews 4 we read it in the beginning verse 12. we are first told to labor to enter into rest we are then told watch for unbelief then we come to verse 4. and verse 4 says for the word of God watch labor to enter in to rest beware of unbelief for the word of God do you know what the way into rest is the word of God do you know the way out of unbelief the word of God if you were reading that whole chapter in context you would almost think that verse 4 is out of place here we're talking about entering into rest and not entering into rest and what that looks like and what unbelief can do and then all of a sudden for the word of God for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword how many of you know what the remedy is the remedy for unbelief is what the way in to rest is what the reason we must labor to interest and remove the threat of unbelief from our life is because the word of God is a weapon what kind of weapon you think it is well the Bible said it's a crushing hammer the Bible said it's a devouring Flame but the Apostle here says the word of God is a what too edged sword sharp on both edges Cuts in Cuts coming out but it gets the job done if you believe that same man let's stand musicians are coming word of God Speak would you pour down like rain washing my eyes to see your majesty to be still and know that you're in this place please let me stay and rest in your Holiness word of God's spirit word of God speak would you pour down my brain washing my

unbelief when you'd like for the Lord to strengthen you and you're not ashamed I mean you'd rather it not be so me too but you're not ashamed you're willing to be strengthened of the Lord I wish you'd just slip up your hand [Music] you see God sees every one of these hands leave it up if you will father these are your children and we recognize that we're living in an evil day we recognize that the enemy is pulling out all the stops his ultimate desire is to discourage distract and dissuade us from actively mixing our faith with what we know your word has said but we have our hands lifted up today standing in your presence saying Lord help me I don't believe it's true of any of these saints that they don't believe I personally believe that they all believe this is that creeping doubt that the enemy likes to it's the only thing he has it's the only tool he has and there's only one way to beat him back and to ultimately defeat him and that is the word that you have given us so Lord I pray right now over every person who raised their hand and said the battle has been particularly hot lately I pray Lord oh I pray right now that your strength would be upon in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus we resist the enemy now now we expose him and take authority over him in the name of Jesus we drive our stake a little deeper in the ground today we refuse to allow the enemy to cause us to miss out on the rest there is a rest given to the people of God one that you don't have to be buried to have it's our rest it's our inheritance it's our promise and I ask right now Lord that your strength if you're standing near someone with a hand up still just lay your hand on a shoulder Italian Lord we pray for streamers who may have lifted their hands who may know the same struggle and we ask for strength for them right now in the name of Jesus foreign [Music] I think it's amazing and wonderful that your people would be honest and open before you and say Lord I I struggle the battle has been particularly hot in my mind and I want to step out of that today and if it is not your will for me to move completely out of it I want something good to be accomplished through this battle I'm willing to receive whatever blessing you have for me Lord if you'll keep strengthening my hands to fight if you'll keep strengthening my shoulders to push against and push back whatever the enemy sins give me Grace and strength to refuse his delivery to possess the Reigns of my own mind casting down all imaginations bringing into subjection every thought that exalts itself against the intimacy of relationship with Christ is [Music] I don't usually do things like this but would you just take a deep breath in through your mouth this time just a deep breath deep as you can take and then let it out I want you to do that several times right now in his presence just just a prophetic act I want you to do it right now you that will no no Force but no pressure but I wished
