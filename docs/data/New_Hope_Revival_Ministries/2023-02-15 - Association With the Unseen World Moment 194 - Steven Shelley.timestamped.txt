[0:00] we want to create an atmosphere that
[0:02] makes all of the Heavenly hosts welcome
[0:04] to come
[0:08] [Music]
[0:13] I'm not looking to to to call Angels on
[0:17] the scene I can call God on the scene
[0:21] but I'm wanting to create an atmosphere
[0:23] in my life and in my worship and in my
[0:27] service when I'm together with you that
[0:29] that angels feel free
[0:32] but the random called them into place he
[0:34] said may they come and take up their
[0:36] their positions along these walls and
[0:39] along these aisles and pews
[0:42] they're here to minister
[0:44] praise God so we're not going to start
[0:47] some big Focus but we're going to say
[0:50] that we believe that angels are with us
[0:53] and that they are among us
[0:55] and we want to create an atmosphere that
[0:58] makes all of the Heavenly hosts welcome
[1:00] to come I tell you they're not welcome
[1:03] they don't desire to be and dead dry
[1:07] emotionless
[1:10] structured
[1:12] you you couldn't even call it worship
[1:15] it's a stretch to call it a song service
[1:19] don't you settle for that don't you
[1:21] settle for that don't you be guilty of
[1:23] that and don't you let anybody shame you
[1:26] because you want something more than
[1:27] that
[1:29] we want an atmosphere where God can come
[1:32] and move and do what he desires to do in
[1:35] our lives where he can reach out over
[1:37] that camera and impact people's lives we
[1:42] want a place where angels can come and
[1:44] work and minister in the Heavenly Host
[1:48] and even the cloud of witnesses
[1:51] you better be looking to find a place to
[1:53] do what God has called you to do and if
[1:56] you don't know what he's called you to
[1:57] do do something for the kingdom
[1:59] according to the word do something good
[2:01] and don't be surprised if when you
[2:05] commit and rededicate your life to the
[2:09] Lord especially in Seasons like we're in
[2:11] right now don't be surprised if your
[2:14] association with the Unseen World and
[2:16] the supernatural does not increase it
[2:19] it's very possible and quite probable
[2:22] that your association with the Unseen
[2:25] World and the supernatural will indeed
[2:27] increase because you've just come to
[2:30] believe that it's for you
[2:31] just simply saying it's for me
[2:34] the Supernatural is for me I'm called to
[2:37] be a supernatural believer and meaning
[2:39] that with all your heart is enough to
[2:42] cause your association with the Unseen
[2:44] World and the supernatural to greatly
[2:45] increase if you believe that squeeze out
[2:48] an amen
[2:49] [Music]
