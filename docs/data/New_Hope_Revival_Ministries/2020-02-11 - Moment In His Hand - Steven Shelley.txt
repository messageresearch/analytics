TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but I want you to know when God has a thought about you it's done in his mind before the cross he already paid the price in in our earthly realm of time it had not yet happened yet but from the first moment he thought it in that eternal realm it was done now God had to speak it into time for it to happen in our dimension in our realm but I want you to know when God has a thought about you it's done all the variables that will come come in the realm of time but in the realm of eternity when God thought about you and saw that you would have that that grace that that desire to choose him from that moment you were saved salvation was secured we're going to experience something in our life maybe that we recognize that in our flesh we could never be saved in our flesh we could never pay enough price in our own righteousness we could never be accepted in his sight but because of what he has done and I'll tell you how valuable you were to him he didn't just think this ugly bloody messy painful plan he lived it he became flesh so that he could secure it with his own life with his own blood by his own sacrifice what God in his right mind according to the thoughts of man would come up with a plan that would cost him so much that would be so much pain and suffering and agony and yet he did you tell me a God's gonna go to the trouble that he went to to bring salvation to us to walk in a man's body to shed God's blood to suffer in crime in agony like he did and then let your inability to hold on to him determine your eternity I don't believe it no man shall pluck him from my hand [Music]
