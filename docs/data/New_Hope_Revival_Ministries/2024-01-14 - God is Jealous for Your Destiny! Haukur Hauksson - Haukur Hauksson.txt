pray that you would lead me and guide me help me Lord give me the grace just to to be sensitive Lord I love you more than anything I I I truly love you Lord [Music] you're such a good father I want to thank you for what you're doing in all of our Lives it may be painful uncomfortable but you're doing it out of love you you saw something before we were born and you are carefully crafting Our Lives into something [Music] Beautiful Lord we just Commit This Moment to your hands into your into your spirit Lord let your perfect plan unfold father in jesus' name amen you can be did I'm going to be touching my phone but I'm not playing on my phone I'm going to try to control the slides with my phone we'll see how it goes uh he may not be very polished it's going to be real a little bit raw uh I am I was asked to preach quite a bit ago and I kind of said no not not plainly but there was something going on in my life and that's I think it was in November but then December for me was the most interesting month probably in many many years uh but then he came to me again brother Shelly and there was something within me that I had to say yes yes because when you're most uncomfortable and when you don't want to do something that's when you need to do it because if you don't there's something within you that just that that breaks uh so when I'm walking out of brother shelle's office that just this phrase came over me God is jealous over your destiny and he is most importantly he's jealous over your heart like that's what he's after and uh like we may all of us like we we feel like we have a specific purpose some of us have no clue what it is but we have some hints we try to figure it out we get you know usually it's like reveal to us in stages but there's like a there's a main objective that God has for all of us for me for you it's the same thing and uh like our ultimate purpose in life is to be a place where God can live in and in and then we have the ability to love God and out of that come comes our main purpose and that's for the for all of us and that is to love other people it's not to be for somebody to be a teacher or a preacher or a writer producer or have an orphanage like that's all secondary because if you don't love your neighbor it has no meaning and so where God had to deal with me very harshly uh like I think I've never like the last two two three years of my life have been amazing in the natural but in the spiritual inwardly in my heart it's been like horrible and uh when I got a word that God was going to cleanse me like the prophets of old like I had no idea what was fixing to happen on the inside you know I'm just coasting along and on the inside of me I'm absolutely trembling everything in the natural looks amazing everything's going well uh but inwardly I could not enjoy any single thing and and you feel like you're losing your mind like what in the world is going on and it is so uncomfortable but now I know what it what it was all about and I'm thankful for it now because God is realigning you to the purpose why you were born okay one of the scribes came and heard them arguing and recognized that he had answered them well asked him what commandment is the foremost of all Jesus answered the foremost is here o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself there is no other commandment greater than this so um the whole Bible is summarized in three verses like it's all it's all about that and so it may sound easy but it you incapable of loving God on your own and it's impossible it sounds so right to love your neighbor but the love that he's talking about how does he describe his love laying down your life for your friends think about others more than yourself there's very like that is in in our Human Condition it's impossible without the Holy Ghost and it takes a lot in life to learn to love because that is the progress of our destiny we are here to learn to love and I wish it was easy like I I I really do but it's extremely difficult um so I want to talk a little bit about Destiny I want to talk about discipline and also just going into the Simplicity Simplicity of what God has done for our lives because as you grow as you walk with God you you can become numb for the main thing in the beginning you are like you are so thankful that God is real that he loves you and that he went on a cross for you and then as you go along and you go in a religious rout the cross becomes a Bible story and not a living reality in your life until you really need it and uh I want to talk a little bit about that uh and you have forgotten the exhortation which was addressed to you as Sons my son do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord nor faint when you are reproved by him For Those whom the Lord loves he disciplines and he scorches every son whom he receives I'm going to go back into that at the end of this the what I'm going to share but it can be a proof that God is disciplining you that that he loves you if he just leaves you alone and you go on your own way that that's not good at all so he will deal with you with all your issues from out his motive is love and I thought it was appropriate to listen to brother Daniel's songs and the last song of of Joshua that he sung because I have prayed dangerous prayers a big part of my my journey and you probably have too and you have no idea what you were praying for Lord break my will Lord have your perfect way in in in my life whatever it takes right so when it h then then it happens to you and you're like you freak out and you have you have no idea what what is going on that's right but he's dealing with your heart and and you can't and it takes a lot of pressure to deal with your heart be like yeah and so again uh I'm going to re it a lot of what I'm sharing applies to all of us I'm going to share from a personal experience so it can be a little bit relatable because it's real to me because it's something that I'm going through right now and for for like two to three years I am absolutely trying to seek God there's no lack of me praying or reading or whatever I had no joy zero no peace it didn't matter where I was on the globe what I was doing no peace no joy and and you were wondering I tried to to fix it with every remedy any vitamins the right diet all of it I tried to fix what was going on and I could not figure out what in the world is going on and it it I wasn't re at the moment I wasn't relating I remember in the back of my mind it's like go God is going to cleanse you you know I had it in the back of my mind but I wasn't really aware of it in in the moment I wasn't feeling like oh God is loving on me right now and you know he he's he's he's doing something at all and but what kept me alive and it does to you too even though in my religious fervor and striving and it was a mixture of a genuine desire and selfish ambition and it was mixture of a lot of things but I'm thankful I've I've said it before I'm very thankful that I have a genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost and the spirit of God inside of me would intercede all the time pretty profoundly it's actually the only gift that I know of that God has giving me you know a lot of people are gifted in many many many ways like in the natural in the spiritual I only that's the only gift that I know I have a gift of intercession and so when I would go even feeling like trash the spirit of God would Gran absolutely grown and I would be broken but I would I could stay in prayer for a long time and God would just be doing something but but still just a temporary relief I was reading a book about prayer and uh and this was one of the quotes and it just spoke to me when you think about renouncing your own will and embracing the will of God let me suggest you bear three truths in mind first of all God loves you more than you love yourself second God understands you better than you understand yourself and and third God wants only the best for you when you truly yield to God's will you will discover that it is that is what the Bible says is good acceptable and perfect and sometimes we don't really believe it when when we're under pressure things are not going our way we don't really believe it we know it here but in here we like we doubt it and he knows how to get our attention uh even though we don't feel like it like he he wants he wants to show you that's what I tell my kids like God wants you to know that he loves you one of the biggest thing that the enemy will tell you that God doesn't love you and he's disappointed with you he doesn't like you but I'm going to tell you something God has gone through a lot of trouble both to save you and plan your life it's amazing when you think about it your destiny will cost you everything if it does not you may settle for good and acceptable but it will not be perfect and I feel like the last two to three years and even before that I was in the good and acceptable but not in the perfect and and God uses it and so I want to talk a a little bit about that we all have a specific destiny and and we did not come up with it it was God okay Ephesians 1:1 in him also we have received an inheritance a destiny we were claimed by God as his own having being predestinated chosen appointed beforehand according to the purpose of him who works everything in agreement with the councel and design of his will for we are his workmanship his own master master work a work of art created in Christ Jesus reborn from above spiritually transformed renewed ready to be used for good works which God prepared for us beforehand taking PATH which he said so that we would walk in them living the good life which he pre-arranged and made ready for us one more here and he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on the face of the Earth having determin their appointed times and the boundaries of their lands and territories in Christ your destiny is specifically shaped by the council and design of his word will amen you are his Masterpiece created in Christ for good works that were predetermined before your birth for you for you to accomplish he determined the time in history and the location where we would be born God is preparing you for a destiny in the end times you greatly valued by him to the EXT stand that he chose by his own counsel for you to be alive in this generation this is the generation that will witness the completion of God's plan we're here to be instruments in the greatest Harvest of souls in the history of mankind that's pretty huge if you think about it it's it like it is very very big amen and so let me see I want to talk a little bit about just the progression when you receive so in the beginning when you're born like you don't really know what's going on you know you don't know what like why you're here that you have a destiny that you have a purpose you know and it varies from from person to person because some people they will grow up in a Christian family and so they're taught like oh no you you you're made in the image and likeness of God you have a Destiny and some like me you have no clue you know you're just living your life and you you have no idea what's going on you're just trying to survive uh and so God is a spirit and you can't know him without Revelation and you cannot know the the specific plan for your life if God doesn't reveal it to you you can't just come up with it in your own mind it's something Sovereign that God does in your life you need to be sensitive to it you know you you need to you know like me I'm I'm very curious and but there comes a time that God has an appointment with all of us even if you're not a Christian or if you're a Christian everyone has to have an appointment where God reveals himself to you and it takes the spirit of Revelation so he was asking the disciples who he was he said to them but who do you say that I am I'm not going to like tell you the surroundings and all of that I have a lot to cover but Jesus is asking his disciples that have been walking with him like but who do you say that I am Simon P Simon Peter answered you are Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus said to him blessed are you Thon bonah because Flesh and Blood did not re reveal this to you but my father who is in heaven it it has to come from the father that you can see Jesus without that you will you can hear about Jesus all day long but if it's not revealed to you because he's going to ask you who do you say he is if can you truly say that from Revelation that he is the Christ the son of the Living God and is he that to you personally not just your parents but to you personally no one can come unto me unless the father who sent me draws him and I will raise him up in the last day it is written in the prophet phets and they shall be taught of God everyone who has heard and learned from the father comes to me amen and so there's a moment for ex example in my life that this happens to me and I had no idea that the spirit of the father was dealing with me at the moment there's just a there's a supernatural act of Grace happening in my life without me trying anything all of a sudden I am spiritually awakened to something that I have no clue what is what was going on and I am delivered from drugs alcohol and all kinds of stuff in almost in a moment and God then starts to reveal to me at that moment who Jesus is and I remember at that moment that uh my mind was having a hard time to comprehend that God became a man my mind was just like there was something just like it's too it's far out because when you look at the universe you look at just creation that that God who created all of that became a man but there was something on the inside that I could not let go and then eventually I just accepted it and it was the the greatest moment in all my life because what happens is like depending on where you are in my case never feeling accepted loved or whatever then all of a sudden oh wow I'm loved by God I'm accept it and that is in a moment I will never forget life trans transforming experience and so when you get this Revelation that Christ became a man and you accept it there's something profound that happens you literally become a new creation you're no longer just a son of Adam you become a son of the last Adam you come a new creation first came the natural and then the spiritual all of a sudden you are a spiritual son you you go from like the kingdom of darkness into the Kingdom of Light and everything changed your whole perspective about life you know what what everything is about the reason for living a reason for existence and um and it's it is amazing because now your priorities change where you're going change you think differently and there's like a there's a there's a new nature Within that you had no idea was real and at that moment often in the beginning there's like there's there's joy there's love there's something amazing that happens to you that you had never experienced before but there's a lot of of stuff junk that God needs to deal with and I had no idea it would take so long like no idea therefore if anyone is in Christ he is a new creature the old things passed away behold new things have come but it but may it never be that I would boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ through which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world for neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision but a new creation and it's pretty wild would if you would say to an unbeliever it's like no I'm from another race I'm from another world but that's reality you are literally a new creation and everything has become new and so when you become a new creation and all of a sudden you're spiritually awakened then the sense of Destiny starts to be awakened within you it's then when you're like oh wow there is a specific purpose I have a father in Heaven and he has a specific purpose for my life and so you go on a quest I did now I'm like oh wow sense of Destiny purpose and like I'm like oh let's go for it you know and I would I would be I would pray a lot about it I really did and when this is happening I am shortly after I get saved what I do I go work for a Christian Ministry television station in Iceland and that was amazing because at that time that television network was growing exponentially and became one of the biggest Network in Iceland and there was a lot of fruit at that point in that Ministry and and what happened was we were getting a lot of phone calls people getting healed saved you know people dealing with them of avoiding suicide and it it was remarkable to see what was happening and I was so excited and but also at the same time so what I want to tell you here what I'm going to lean into is there there was there have been multiple things that have been said to me personally both in prophetic words in dreams in prayer and all of that about my purpose and you probably have the same thing for you God deals with you God gives you a word you read something whatever you know and you long to to fulfill it there's two things that happened to me that that screamed to me like this is a part of your where you're born you know that I've never let go off and I want to let you know that you need to do the when when God makes something real to you don't ever let go the preparation is is going to be longer right and harder than you ever imagined and so it's it's the key ingredient to to fulfill the purpose of your life is not to give up when things don't look like you thought they were going to look um and so I'm going to paint up just that I've shared this before I just want to paint just a quick picture um because I'm going to read quite a bit so you have to stay awake I know I'm not very Dynamic so just try a little extra to like keep yourself awake um so I am working at that television network and I am filming programs called Israel today this speaks to me about sovereignty what I'm fixing to share with you uh so brother Olaf who hosted a program Israel today in Iceland on the Omega television that I work for he goes two times a years he has passed away now he's with the Lord he he went on average on average two times to Israel three months at a at a time one of the trip 2003 he goes to a meeting that brother Shel was preaching at and my wife was in that meeting too brother Ola comes back home from Israel in 2003 he comes to the channel and I remember being in the in the kitchen at the channel and brother Ola is like hey there's this pastor from Alabama and he loves the truth that you love and he loves Jerusalem and the Jewish people and all of us we're like oh wow that is super interesting um I want to tell you also in the beginning of my journey that you know that God is sovereignly like leading you is that brother brandham is not there's not many message churches or message Believers in Iceland would you would label a message believer that believed the truth that was brought by Brother RAM and and and so what happens to me in in Iceland shortly after I'm saved I have no clue who brother brandom is and I have no clue that there is something called the message or any of that and I remember I'm walking beside some shelves and I pick up a booklet and it was printed on pages like this and had like a a tan colored Co cover and there was nothing to it it did not look attractive to the eye but I feel pulled to to to take it out of the Shelf I take it home to read it and I was it was the Supernatural series and I remember I'm met my grandparents and I read it and I cried like a baby I go back to the office the the the at the television I go back to the television office and I was like hey you have no idea what I just read and you know there's this William Bram and like man it's it's incredible and they were blown away because I'm like 20 21 22 I can't remember exactly because they had been heavily persecuted in Iceland for mention William Bram all the churches hated Eric ericsen the founder and really were against him they did not like that he had the only television network in Iceland and that he believed that brother Brandon was a Propet they did not like it at all and so they had kind of started to go under uh just undercover with the message you know and so they were not trying to get meat to be involved or anything like that so they were blown away when I come back it's like hey you you need to read this thing you know that actually excited them anyway and so I started listening to I'm going to share another story related to that real quick so when I was 14 I think I was 14 my dad who didn't was not very involved in my life um I actually love him a lot today but at that moment he was not very involved in my life he dared to give me a Bible for Christmas when I was 14 and I was so mad finally he gives me a present and it's the Bible you're like and so that's that's when I'm 14 I don't use that Bible at all and I had forgotten what I had done with that Bible totally and then one time after I get saved I get interested in in in the message brother Eric Ericson gives me a huge uh box of cassette tapes from the message so I bring that to my grandmother like huge box ton of tapes but I have nothing to play the cassettes nothing to play with it like I didn't have a cassette player and so I just put it my my my box there and like I need to buy a cassette player and then because of the transformation in my life going like my brother saw what happened to me going from like drug addict violent just I don't know what I didn't do anything that was pleasant at that time and I'm not trying to elaborate on that that was just how it was and my brother was so affected that he got on fire for God just seeing my transformation so he comes to my grandmother and he's like hey because he got a Bible too so he comes like maybe my Bible is somewhere at at in in the basement at my grandmother's and and he and I actually tell him if you go down there see if my Bible is there too I would love to you know I had no idea my brother goes down comes back up he's like hey I found my Bible and I was like oh no where's you know I got really disappointed but there was something in me just like no it's there so I go from the sixth floor take the elevator down and I remember I open the door um of that little room and about 4 feet high there's one brown box two feet away from the door like the first box I see just and I opened the box there was my Bible that I got when I was 14 and a cassette player beside it and that was like that spoke to me it's still about the sovereignty of God and I remember I started listening and there was something like there's a grace period when you first get saved where you just drink and eat and drink and eat and I would say it's very important to utilize that Grace because you don't always have it but uh God did a lot just to s a lot of Truth in my life at that time okay so brother Olaf so I'm like I I start to love to listen to the truth that we of all cherish and and I actually remember going to Pentecostal churches to be around other young people just to have fellowship and it created a lot of controversy even so that it was publicly spoken by the biggest Pentecostal preacher on their website what I was doing because everybody's just sharing what they love and I didn't know Church politics really even though I was reading of and so I'm just ignorant like just in love with Jesus and it's like oh man check this out and they're like uhuh and so people went against it pretty hard okay so here's what happens brother Olaf comes back from Israel and he talks about brother Shelly and and I am intrigued he loves he he loves God he loves the truth that we cherish he love and I because of I was always filming Israel today I started to love Israel and the Jewish people previously I was under the same atmosphere as most icelanders anti-Semitic no reason no idea why but I did not like the Jews I couldn't tell you why but that was my just my attitude because when your spirit is dead and you're just in the atmosphere of Darkness you get conformed to the dark darkness and it's normal to you and you have no idea why but when you get from the uh kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of Life your your things change and uh and so me and brother Magnuson that worked at the station we were very intrigued and I remember uh brother Magnuson printed something out from the website ral.org and I read it and then I went online and I read some of the transvision that brother shalet had and that is what triggered me while I'm standing in front of you today and I don't want to and so because I didn't see some of that happen over the years that is why I got in trouble with God I'll elaborate so what I want to do right now I want to read quite a bit and you have to it's so what I'm fixing to read is pretty epic if just it is to me it's absolutely phenomenal it is of a profound nature I can't emphasize it emphasize it enough and I want to read it and it'll take me some time but this is this I believe pertains to all of us I really do okay so brother shell I think this is in January of 98 and brother shell is taken into the realm of the spirit as we were pouring out our hearts to him in song I could both feel and hear the Lord beoning me I willingly went with him into the realm of the spirit and saw before me a beautiful River covered in a rising Mist even through the Mist I could see the river bottom as it was not very deep a kind Angel stepped up and said only a few have ever been called to this place I asked where is this place his answer seemed a bit strange if you always know where each Journey we lead fear will attack your faith it is The Great Divide he added soon many will stand where only a few have previously stood across the Mist river is the throne room of the most high God he further explained that as the seat of God as of the seat of God and the throne room Throne from which the bloody lamb stepped forth he also said all who stand before this Throne can say that they have seen the fullness of God his word seemed Grand and a bit strange to me but it was filled with a longing to stand Before the Throne of God that I had never known before the mist of the thickening and Rising the Mist was thickening and Rising higher as we stood on the bank as though protecting what was on the other Shore the angel said to me do not fear storms fear storms often arise in the middle of the river in the place where the waters run cold many have been called this far to cross this River but have turned back when they fac the Blackness of the storms remember many are called but only few are chosen that actually spoke to me more now than ever about when things get hard and black and you know don't go back don't give up you feel like it's it's not going to happen you feel like it's too difficult you're disappointed don't don't turn back I begin pleading my case before this angel in this whole atmosphere I quickly realized that I was still carrying hurt and unhealed wounds from what had gone through what had from what we have gone through in the ministry I explained my weariness and loss and expressed the fear that had made it difficult for me to go forward what did he say you must run on anyway that's where I am right now I have to I have to go on I asked about some of my companion who had become wounded in the fight and a few that appeared to be utterly defeated he said that not one would be lost from God's hand and for anyone who would lay down the sword there would be three or more raised up to take their place he also said that a clear revelation of God's glory would be imparted and a perfect understanding of his person and character as well as revelatory rituals would flow from his throne the bride was being summoned to the throne room of lamb I remember when I was reading that the first time I was like whoa I want to I want to go to the throne that was just my like I want to go there I have to go there he was now standing on the other side of the river backing me to follow he explained that we were being summoned to the throne room on the on top of the mountain of God across the wide river I remember thinking in sounded strange a river on top of a mountain but understood that this language was not to be comp contemplated with an Earthly perspective but with a spiritual insight Zion the higher spiritual Place represent the Throne of God the Abode of the fullness of his presence before this Throne we experience more of the measure of his presence than angels have previously brought to us and this full manifested Glory requires protocol of reverence and deep respect the angel said that in order for us to move to the throne there would be others spiritual Dimensions through with through which we must make our way this initial Throne Room visitation will unfold to you in three parts you will not be allowed to go the entire way this time as there is a spiritual conditioning necessary to become acclimated to walk in these higher Realms of Glory you must first experience the full release of your Earthly body I have to be honest I always wonder what that meant on your next visit you will be guided across the Great Divide to the far shore of the River from there you will catch your first glimpse of the Throne of the Lamb you will be permitted to come close enough to the throne to worship the angel reminded me that I was living in a chosen generation that had previously received a significant word through our Prophet excuse me he said that the full significance of what what had had been delivered in the past generation would be further understood by a bridal Throne Room company now being prepared so this intrigued me quite a bit because I felt God supernaturally lead me to brother branam and I was really captured by the Revelation that I was reading and now I felt like okay there's some kind of a continuation going on in my time that's what it really intrigued me the angel told me to tell the people to prepare their Hearts to stand in the throne room a new move sorry a new and more glorious strength the strength and might of the Lord would be released to them this would cause the transition from knowing god to having the character of God being like him every answer to every question lies in this place before the throne I have a lot of questions and I want some answers as we learn the bright access to the throne room in the end time we will be able to move in and out of this realm spiritually whenever I need Rises she will then go forth with the covering of seven spirits of God as I narrated aloud to those in the room with me while my spirit was in trans a prophecy began to flow out of my mouth for even as aser was summoned Before the Throne in a pleasurable robes to please the king I will also extend my scepter of favor upon those who are being called forward and upward in this hour she must come fully clothed in Robes of praise and worship for this is the atmosphere of my throne room when I have given her my accepter of favor my kingdom will be at her command even as it has been at my command she will exit from me with Throne Room favor when she steps forth from this place she will lead and not cower cower cower she will speak and the host of heaven will hasten to carry out her request she will become one with me and I will instinctively instinctively know my will and desire for all things and she will only speak in agreement with that she will walk with courage and strength in the revelation of her identity and never again question her position in me I have to be honest I've actually on my journey even with profound spiritual experiences not profound even with very personal experiences that are real to me um I have often questioned my identity sometime I'm like oh I God loves me more than anybody he is just he loves me yeah I'm I'm absolutely and then the next one is like am I'm going to be a Judas am I going to betray him like and so God doesn't want you to be in in a limbo like oh but you know what I do when I question my identity I'll go on my knees even when I don't feel like it and I tell them I believe you Jesus Christ and you died for my sins you are my father and and I speak the truth that I know our true and that's how I survived so you can see that um you can see that why brother Shel emphasizes praise and worship it's a it's so vital to enter into the Throne of God and that's why the enemy fights you to worship amen he doesn't want you to feel his presence he doesn't want you to feel love and he does not want you to go there at all that's why it is a fight and I'm not I'm not going to say proud um thankful that brother Shel is able to strive and fight for it and not give up you know keeping keeping that truth before the people because when you enter into true worship it is the best feeling in the whole world you forget about yourself your spirit is one with with God and it it is it is just amazing I know this is going to sound a little bit weird because it felt weird in the beginning when it it came to me but this prophecy I was one time reading this reminding me like why am I here why am I in Alabama why did I come here so I read this things often to remind me and and this Pro so at that this particular time mirabeth was carrying a baby a little girl and I was reading and it came to me you should name your baby girl eser and that's what and I was like no it's weird I don't want to get that from a prophecy that's like I don't know it just felt weird to me but I couldn't get away from it I could not get away from it and so I prayed and because Aster is not really a Hebrew name like I I didn't have like 100% peace about it but I could not get away from it the more I prayed the more convinced I was her name is s and then I don't think I originally told marbeth that's how I got the quickening but we talked about it and we agreed to name ASAS and then when the pregnancy goes along I'm realizing ah she might be born around Purim and then meab was starting to have some complications it was like no that it's probably not going to happen but right after midnight Midnight on puim the water breaks and we run to the hospital and Esther was born on porum and to me God was dealing with me okay first at least you can sometimes hear me but also what he showed me in the beginning that this is real it really is real and we cannot accomplish okay let me just talk about me I don't have the ability to be a tool in the hand of God In My Own Strength my identity it has to be something of that nature it has to be where you can you never doubt who you are you go forth in his Spirit his strength not my idea or my agenda I'm going to read just a little bit from the next transvision not this much much less um but I'm telling you when when I read that I've had mult like you all of us have prophetic words over us we' have had dreams like literal dreams but not my spirit responded to that more than anything else it screamed this is your destiny and it was it it it affected me so much that I begged the owner of the television network to invite brother Shelly not realizing that Perry green at the tucon Tabernacle had talked about Eric Ericson in Iceland years before and so I am begging him and then you know brother Shel gets a ton of invitation all the time and so but when he heard that name and Eric Ericson calls he immediately came that's how this connection came you know and uh and I can't because this was so loud and clear in my spirit this is a part of your destiny this is the part of where you're born it's the end time move of God and I don't believe that's only going to happen here not at all it's going to happen all over but it was for me and for you this is here not saying that God can't transfer you I'm not you know I don't have to be if God wants me to be somewhere but I can't go somewhere else but God doesn't tell me that is rebellion it really is okay I'm going to just a little bit more of so this happens I think just a few months after the uh the one that I just shared with you and I'm I'm I don't want to read too much so I shorten it he's in a he he is taken back to the river and this time he's he crosses the river I then asked my angel guide if he knew why I had been summoned he responded because he knew that you would tell of all that you see and hear he also explained that the Heavenly Host Knew by my coming that greater access to Heavenly realm Realms was being given to the bride which was a clear indication that the Final Chapter was approaching the bride will be given training strength and Supernatural wisdom as she spends time in Heavenly places I knew that the bride would gain certain things only by moving in and out of this spiritual Dimensions she would learn so much more about the character and the heartbeat of the Lamb by abiding in the atmosphere highly charged with Glory this would help to prepare her for her final work this equipment would also enable the bride to move in greatest fears of authority tearing down strongholds and bringing Deliverance to those previously considered the hard cases and so who who knows what Roland and Heidi beger are Irish Ministries okay there are missionaries in musm Beek the grandfather of Roland Baker was a missionary in China Visions be beyond the veils anybody read Visions beyond the veils it's profound so there's an orphanage in China Bo orphanage and in what happened in the early 1900 I can't remember exactly something similar to what we are reading here the boys young boys were taken up in transis to the throne room very ignorant a lot of them totally ignorant of the Bible were were able to describe biblical truth about hell about judgment about New Jerusalem in details and then they came down and they were they were had unprecedented anointing and authority to to reach people totally Supernatural and so the grandson of that missionary I think it's Arthur I can't remember no h Harold Harold beger was the missionary in China the grandson of Herold he is a missionary in mosm Beek and heid beggar and I'm reading a book called birthing the miraculous I read a lot and and it's actually a profound book and what there was something interesting that that spoke to me concerning this of not giving up because it took 20 years to get they were on the mission field for 20 years and they were about to give up run down wore out and none nothing happening I think they had three churches not that great churches in in mosm Beek they had been giving amazing promises for mosm Beek that God was going to give them the nation God was going to do the impossible through them but after 20 years they like their words like we're going to give up we can't do this and then in one year I there everything changed one natural disaster happened in mosm Beek almost half a million people lost their home and that Ministry Irish Ministries went from three churches the details may be wrong so don't quote me but from three churches to thousands of churches they had been praying for the sick for the blind for the deaf for years because they were told this is you're going to heal the sick the no Miracles nothing happened dead but they kept praying and then they prayed again now it's a daily occurrence today it's tens of thousands of churches Total Transformation the like what they're doing is incredible but I was thinking the same thing with with this what God was making real to me here you you feel like oh it's not going to happen you you your your faith grows cold and but you can't give up because in the one moment thinking absolutely shift but you will not be a part of it if you back out and I'm I'm GNA try to hurry because I'm going to shift into something else so I started with God being disciplining you what I what happened to me so let me just make God wants you to be successful I absolutely believe that God wants to bless you God wants good things for your life and but what happened to me like I got a little bit disappointed slowly but surely just a little bit you know and when when something that you believe with all of your heart all you you you you move to another nation and you just you are you're so invested in it you're so hopeful hopeful and but it it the things don't transpire like you expect them to you start to die I did I started to die and what what do I do I'm going to come up with an idea to make things my destiny happen because God had made two things real to me about my destiny it was to help I feel like with a Christian television n in Iceland I don't know exactly how it's going to look like or anything but it was really real to me and then being here and being prepared forever what God has for me you know in a supernatural way both of those and through dreams about the Omega there were things that God I thought really spoke to me very clear but then I was like no things are not really going to happen like I envisioned them and so what happened is like uh I go and I wanted to make things happen in Iceland in My Own Strength not really making any plans but in my heart I'm like I'm I'm losing vision of what God Made Real to me and what was what was worse is like my the joy of my salvation was gone and the old so here's the crazy thing we're we're crazy people I I was going to go to Iceland and do Christian Media but I had no no like genuine desire to see the Lost saved I'm just going to but I had an agenda because I felt like God wanted me in media and and you're going to go with that but the heart for the people wasn't there you know you're just in a a religious strive fervor that isn't real and that's torture it really is and so and I'm praying all the time and also this just the intimacy that I used to have with God had diminished that I'm always praying but there's this feeling of being loved and allowing God to love you and then love others that was just getting really numb and that was extremely uncomfortable and so two years ago when God told me like hey I'm going to cleanse you like the prophets of old he was going to answer my prayers because I always prayed I I have for years I want a clean heart the most uncomfortable thing is when you feel like your heart is not pure it is torture and I know also was always praying I want God's perfect will but at the same time I'm just inwardly going in a different direction and then God comes along because he loves you and he hears your prayers okay I'm going to read uh a few verses before closing therefore since we have such okay therefore since we have a great cloud of witnesses surrounding us let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and let us run with an endurance the race that is set before us endurance we need endurance oh and these cloud of witnesses that are talking about their life was pretty rough and a lot of the things that they had to accomplish took a long time and they without us are not perfect they we are cooperating with some incredible people and Angels fixing our eyes on Jesus the author and the perfector of of Faith who for the joy sat before him endured the cross despising the shame and has sat down at the right hand of the Throne of God this is a key to endure the race when you fix your eyes on him because he endured the cross and when you go in a rut and you feel like you failed you feel shame in all your mistakes then this becomes real to you I like I have cried and begged and tell God God I'm so sorry I was so wrong I can't believe I put myself in this condition I and you know what happens you go back to the basics you just start to appreciate what God has done for you and out of that some genuine love for God and for other people it's it's not all the exra go going with your selfish selfish ambition your agenda you can't accomplish anything it is the Simplicity Simplicity simplic I have a hard hard done with that word it's just being devoted to God and just just love him and the and and also when that happens when you truly feel regret and sorry is also Allowing God to love you back because if you don't allow God to love you back youve nothing to give to your neighbor for consider him who has endured such hostility by Sinners against himself so that you will not grow weary and lose heart you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin and you have forgotten the exhortation which addresses to you as Sons my son do not regard like L the discipline of the Lord nor faint when you are reproved by him like I've never been reproved as of lately never I've gone through ups and downs and God deals with me but nothing like lately and sometimes you feel like I I I'm not going to survive it's like I'm too too many mistakes it's not but you have not not I Promise You For Those whom the Lord loves he disciplines and he scorches every son whom he receives it is for discipline that you endure God deals with you as with sons for what son is there whom his father does not discipline but if you are without discipline of which all have become partakers then you you are illegit illegitimate children and not Sons furthermore we have we had Earthly fathers to discipline us and we respected them shall we not much rather be subject to the father of spirits and live for they disciplined us for a short time as seemed best to them but he disciplines us for our good so that we may share his holiness that it that is powerful if you think about it to sear in the Holiness of God all discipline for the moment seems not to be joyful but sorrowful that's for sure yet to those who have been trained by it afterwards it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness that's where I'm after right now peaceful fruit of righteousness where you are just at rest not in your strive I am the true wine and my father is the wine dresser every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away and every branch that bears fruit he prunes it so that it may be be so it may bear more fruit so the purpose of him pruning you is so you can fulfill yeah for fruit fulfill whatever God has for your life so the promises of God can come into reality that's the love of God but for us we have to say yes there's something in me is like that doesn't like want to cooperate because it's so uncomfortable but it's the only way for every believer that's right let me ask you a question it's it's it's a trick question who wants to follow the lord okay then Jesus said to his disciples if anyone wishes to come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever wishes to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it for what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and for forfeits his soul or what will man give in exchange for his soul this is where God was dealing with me is I was I was trying to save my life I wanted a little bit of Independence I wanted to be like oh it's it's it's time for you now to really grow up and be be a man and do something that that was my like I Justified it in my mind I mean that sounds right and I was just like and I can like I have some things that God wants to do in I I wasn't moving to Iceland full time at all that was not my plan but there was things that I wanted to do there and I was just going to make it happen but still being completely num numb and empty because when when I realized what was going on okay let me go I'm almost then let me when I realiz here's what would happened in beginning of December just at the start of December God show me it's like I there was a light bulb that came and I and I go to Marth and tell her like hey I know why everything is crumbling underneath me it's real it's like you because because I stopped paying attention of what was going on right here and I tell her that and I become so uneasy almost to like I would walk and feel sick in my stomach I would be walking here on the campground and it was so uncomfortable I been i' had been feeling uneasy for a long time with what I was doing and and then December I had couple of dreams that was warning me what was going on in my life and so and then out of that like I stopped what I was doing doing as for making a living and what I was doing in my life it and God was working on both parties and and I knew what was going on was God with every fiber of my being it was God and but at the same time it was absolutely terrifying like what am I going to do like how do I move forward like how do you take care of your family D and it was it was so painful because the the unknown and the uncertainties are very uncomfortable but at the same time God was in all of it and and so you God it was I felt the resistance of God for a long time God was actually blessing me on multiple levels but no peaceful fruit of righteousness it didn't exist but external seemed okay and and then God started dealing with me about like so you were absolutely a nobody I reveal myself to you I go into all this trouble to send you to Alabama and make something so real to you and then you're just going to give up that's a little bit offensive you know who am I and and then God started to renew hope within me it's like all the promises of God they take a long time a lot of preparation and so and then he showed me he like uh what if I ever go back to Iceland like in the summer or something what has to happen what is birth here this is what actually God showed me originally I'm just I'm not saying it is God it's I think it's God what I feel like what was going to happen here what would be birthed here I could then carry something to Iceland I you can't go some like you can't just beat defeated here and then tried to do something somewhere else it doesn't make any sense and so now God is telling me like with with with this with the studio with Iceland with Israel everything it' be like renewed hope it's going to happen and I'm super excited about it the M mus musicians can come and so when God no when God when brother Shel asked me to speak I was like I'm not in a place to speak but and then I just like I have to do it and I just want to encourage you if there's it it's it doesn't matter matter how it looks like and often God just wants you to come back to the cross and it's not just a Bible story but it's like it's it's the power of the Cross it's there where he purchased you and redeemed you cleansed you and then you are able when that is real all the shame all the mistakes like you feel like they're mocking you right now staring you in the face and is very uncomfortable but then you appreciate that he has already dealt with it and you have the ability to put it on him and out of that a genuine love and compassion for others is is born and and I feel like God wants to take you away from me a re religious rut and so he shakes you up and and I'm just I'm I'm I'm thankful right now I'm so thankful but it's been last few weeks have been probably the hardest weeks of my entire existence but it was the only way for him to get my attention here something also um one time I had a dream and I think I shared a little bit I didn't elaborate on it that has kept me going for for years when brother brandham came to me in a dream and was praying about my destiny the only thing he said to me was Alabaster Box and of course what I do I bought all the books I could on Alabaster Box and I read everything that brother Brandon talked about it but that's that's my biggest calling in life and I think it's yours too it's to minister to God yes and it and in one thing when he talked there was a a group of people said like hey didn't we prophesy in your name didn't we heal your name preach in your name and it's like I never knew you if you never open up yourself before God he knows everything about you but that's one of the biggest thing that we can prepare in this hour is to minister to God and open up your broken life open up your soul and and be completely transparent you don't just do it with your problems you also you pour out your affection this is the only way for God to know you in a personal way he is not after your performance or your ability he's after something much deeper he's jealous over your destiny but more importantly he's jealous over your heart and he wants you to be okay we can stand up I think he's going to sing a few songs you are not a God created by human hands you are not a god depend on anymal man you are not a God in need of anything we can give by your plan that's just the way it is you are not a God created by human hands you are not a god depend on Immortal man you are not a God in need of anything we can give by your plan that's just the way it is You Are God Alone from Before

subjected to the father of spirits and live may we subject ourselves to you yes may we surrender to your love and to your care give us the grace Lord to truly with our hearts and with our mind and with our faith Faith to look on the things [Music] above we are in this generation because you chose us yes we are here before you oh God you are our King and our creator it's by you and you alone that you enables us to to move forward in the plan and purposes of [Music] God I'm sure like like I have been dealing with stuff that was hindering the plans and purposes of God for my life I'm just asking for grace for some of my brothers and sisters that they can put those things before your feet oh God would you minister to your people may we never let shame or mistakes hinder Us in approaching the throne of grace may we truly see the sacrifice that you gave Lord may it be so real to [Music] us may we run to you for every answer for any unhealed wound for any things in the past that we hold on to oh God may we release it by the grace of God oh Lord I just ask you to minister according to the power of the Holy Ghost Lord we give ourselves to you yes in whatever way that you want to use us would you just help us to say yes yes would you give us the courage that we [Music] need you make the incapable capable you make the weak strong I often really wonder why I was chosen but it has nothing to do with [Music] me there was just a yes in My Heart Lord we want you we want to see you we want to experience you one of the main thing for creating Lord you wanted Fellowship you wanted to express ress your love but you want it to be loved may we meet that need in you may we love you yes may may we from the inside of our heart may we truly truly love [Music] you if somebody in here is dealing with something that they feel is out of their reach would you come by the spirit of God yes would you Minister and deliver if there's any anxiety or depression that we can't shake oh [Music] God may we come to you right now in faith yes would you would you pour out the Holy Ghost into our hearts we commit our ways to [Music] you this like I'm not going to say this is not a word of knowledge at all but is anybody here dealing with like anxiety or depression that you just can't shake if you and you need an assist good did you want to [Music] [Music] say my heart is just pounding to say this because it fits right in and that is to go back to the time because you mentioned mosambique and Malawi or no you didn't mention Mala but the Bakers Etc but 30 years ago brother Shelly had a vision and that was on the 21st of July 93 it was a Tuesday night night and all of a sudden he looked up at the back of the church right above the door there was a map of Africa and he saw that the fire of God had come it started like a flame in the uh he didn't know where it was located he had to even go and look it up on the map and find it exactly and it was in the mosambique Mala area and that is where the fire of God started and then from there it moved to South Africa and it covered all of South Africa and from there it went right over and covered the uh entire um area of all of Africa it started there South Africa and um and so I've always pondered that and so when brother Arnaldo was here yeah and it was on the six six of October we had those special meetings and after uh when we ate there I went over to them and I said you're from South Africa and I just told them about that vision and you know yesterday I thought about this and it happened exactly when I spoke to them that was when all those things were happening in Israel you know because that started on the 7th that Massacre that took place so all of these you know many times there are so many different connections yes and um that Vision about South Africa in 2017 we had a prayer meeting over here and brother ryers was here and um I remember you know the different ones were praying and I want to the front and before I realized I told that Vision about South Africa and while I did Brother Shelly had the same vision again he saw it again and so all I want to say is there are things moving now that happened 30 years ago and there are connections there are so many things and we need to take heed because we have to be obedient and uh I think there are things starting to happen now even in South Africa and God wants to be very you know to be mindful and this church has a lot of connections that we need to pull forward and that's all I wanted to do is just to remind the people and speak that that we believe what the Lord has showed and that we want to walk there [Music] yeah I believe we're about to step into something extraordinary uh I don't know I don't know how it's going to look like I don't know if we're going to see everything that I just read to you I don't know how it's going to look like but the Bible says we're seated together in Heavenly places so your spirit right now is in another dimension and you can be receiving something in the realm of the spirit and you can be sometimes unaware of it and uh there are Supernatural Play Supernatural things transpires in a meeting like this that's why it is important that there is a good atmosphere and your mind off that needs to be in a in a good frame not you know not close push yourself off and I often have been guilty it's like you you're in a rut and so you just do the same thing over and over you know so it take it can take a discipline and to always be in the right frame of mind so you can receive something for yourself because often if you don't you end up just going too far you you close your mind you close your heart for too long and then it's like it's almost too late not that you're like lost or something but you you could go in a a direction that was not meant for you and remind yourself it is extremely difficult one time I'm not saying this is right it was an impression and so I'm going through all this stuff and I feel like I'm losing my mind mind and so I'm I'm I'm walking and I got this impression it's like you have no idea what is coming against you and that you're just able to survive is a miracle because there is a lot of stuff coming against you that you are totally unaware of and you think you're just making these things up in your mind but there is like forces of evil trying to stop you anyway I love all of you and I'm I'm appreciated of the family of God I do remember when I first came here there was so much healing because I had a broken uh family life and so I came here and I felt so much love and it was amazing to me to see normal families because I never experienced it in my life you know was unusual for me for Mom and Dad to stay together but uh what we have here is is precious and sometimes we forget about it and often this is the Bible Way he takes a little group and does extraordinary things and I'm I want to be a part of it I don't know what's going to look like what it is but right now I just want to have a yes in my heart am and not try to do something in my own agenda you know should I just dismiss or you Lord we love you we thank you for your love we want to thank you for your grace Lord I want to thank you for keeping us all these years so many times we we could have just given up but there was something that kept us going would you open up the eyes of our understanding so we can truly see The Inheritance that we have in you what you have in store for your [Music] people may we truly become love not just to be kind that's or courteous but maybe like when I think about the Bible and every time I pray I'm reminded it's all about love and Lord I was in the prayer Chapel the other day and you plainly I feel so plainly told me why in the world would you want to go to Iceland or into Columbus to love somebody if you can't even love the people that I've called you to love and that made so much sense to me may we learn to love each other not take each other for granted and and give us the grace to to live above just the atmosphere of this world and may be something within us just birthed I really feel strongly just the the the commission is to love your neighbor and out of that something bigger can come I just commit my brothers and sisters into your hands and we love you we honor you we bless you for who you are thank you for the gift of life and I want to thank you specially for today this is your gift may we not not take it for granted in the name of Yeshua our Jesus I pray amen you're dismissed to go love you guys see you [Music] Tuesday you are on your throne you are God lord You Are God Alone from Before Time began oh you are on your throne You Are God Alone and
