[0:01] I like
[0:02] visuals visuals sometimes help with
[0:06] things now I don't know how many are you
[0:09] are old enough to have went to
[0:12] restaurants sit down restaurants
[0:14] whenever you used to go for
[0:17] breakfast I whenever I was a 13 years
[0:20] old my first job was working for a
[0:22] little restaurant in town um called the
[0:24] home food shop they had a uh they were
[0:27] they were famous in our town for their
[0:28] breakfast this was the position that the
[0:32] cup was when you sat down at the
[0:35] table now they would come around you'd
[0:38] be sitting there
[0:39] eating and the waitresses or the waiters
[0:42] would come
[0:42] around with a pot of coffee in their
[0:46] hand now at this restaurant particularly
[0:48] that I worked at they did not ask you if
[0:51] you wanted coffee if you wanted
[0:55] coffee when you got to the table you
[0:58] turned the cup up right that signified
[1:02] to them as they would come
[1:04] through I want
[1:06] coffee they wouldn't stop and say are
[1:08] you
[1:09] sure that you don't want some don't want
[1:12] coffee cuz I want to give you some
[1:15] coffee we made coffee we' made it all
[1:17] morning I really want to fill your cup
[1:21] with coffee sir they would never go to
[1:24] your table and turn your cup upright
[1:27] himself what they would do is they if
[1:29] they noticed that your cup looked like
[1:32] this and the person sitting beside you's
[1:34] cup looked like that they would come to
[1:36] you fill it up it this person they
[1:41] didn't even speak to church come on
[1:44] because they left their
[1:47] Cup in a
[1:49] position that signified I I don't want
[1:53] to be filled
[1:57] up people come in
[2:01] and this is the way they live their life
[2:04] exact wonder why and they'll be sitting
[2:07] beside a person that's right
[2:11] here and they'll be
[2:14] like what's the big deal I'm I'm in
[2:16] church
[2:18] too I came to the same
[2:21] restaurant I sat down at the same
[2:26] table but this person's cup got filled
[2:30] yeah and this person's cup got
[2:33] bypassed and all they had to
[2:36] do was change their
[2:39] position
[2:42] there it's all they had to do change the
[2:46] position Amen to allow themselves to
[2:48] become
[2:50] full but you have some that that that go
[2:53] to a
[2:54] restaurant
[2:56] and they
[2:58] had drink
[3:00] the cup was full and then all of a
[3:03] sudden over
[3:05] time it ran out and they
[3:10] say I want to be like that
[3:13] person I used to have the holy ghost in
[3:17] my
[3:18] life I was full at one
[3:22] time and so then you say well I'd be
[3:26] happy to give you some
[3:27] more and they sit in this condition can
[3:30] y'all see yes sir
[3:32] sir sir oh somebody saw it that's right
[3:37] there's a lid on it yes sir got and they
[3:40] come in and they sit there and they say
[3:44] fill me up Lord fill me up Lord but they
[3:48] keep the lid on and then the Holy Spirit
[3:51] comes comes through and the Holy Spirit
[3:53] says you know maybe you're struggling so
[3:57] I I I want to fill you up and it and it
[4:01] it
[4:01] starts trying
[4:05] [Music]
[4:09] to I'm not just making a fool of myself
[4:13] you might think I am but I am preaching
[4:14] right now you sure
[4:16] are the Holy Spirit wants to fill you
[4:22] up you can't go through life saying I
[4:26] was filled with the Holy Ghost 42 years
[4:28] ago
[4:30] yeah I remember when and I'm still
[4:33] living off of that experience exactly it
[4:36] has to be a
[4:38] continual refilling of the baptism of
[4:41] the holy spirit it's not just a oneand
[4:45] done come on you know they they say you
[4:49] could if you sat there long enough you
[4:50] could just continually refill this cup
[4:53] because then if your vessel is full then
[4:56] you can go and you can pour it out to
[4:59] some else and then say Lord fill me up
[5:02] again and I can share it with somebody
[5:04] else and I can keep allowing him to fill
[5:07] my life and I can pour it out and I can
[5:10] help somebody else
[5:16] [Music]
